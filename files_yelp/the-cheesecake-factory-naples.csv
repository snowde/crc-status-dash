Kara M.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",271,647,3103,5.0,11/26/2017,"We stopped in here on a weeknight to take advantage of the happy hour deals.  If you sit in the bar area there are some really reasonable happy hour specials available on food and drinks. The happy hour food options are the same size portions as the regular menu, so you are saving a decent amount. Dawn was the server and she was super efficient.  She was great about checking back on us too! We all ended up ordering appetizers from the happy hour menu and liked what we had. The best part about CCF is the dessert.  I highly recommend grabbing a slice of cheesecake and taking it home for later.  I always leave this establishment stuffed!"
Laura B.,"Naples, FL",309,134,401,3.0,7/29/2017,Well the hostess was nice but the whole m say us down at the table had an attitude.  Had to wait for 20 minutes for some to just say hi and had someone took you order our waiter came he said he was sorry that nobody else had took our orders we made our orders and the food was great
Syl H.,"Bonita Springs, FL",1,44,94,4.0,11/25/2017,"So great to be back in Bonita Springs away from the cold winter. While in Naples, one  of our favorite go to chain is  The Cheesecake Factory. We don't have one at home so it's always nice to get away from winter and enjoy a meal on the patio. While they have a large menu to choose from. We love their lettuce wraps with extra chicken on the side. If you don't like eating with your hands, this meal is not for you. This meal is, tasty and full of flavours.  Don't miss out, give it a try."
Chuck W.,"Pittsburgh, PA",3491,98,790,4.0,12/29/2017,"As good as any Cheesecake Factory. Can't really go wrong. You know you are getting good service, decent food and a unique ambiance."
Larry B.,"Miami, FL",92,48,219,4.0,6/30/2017,The cheesecake factory never disappoints. It was my first time eating at this Naples location and we got seated rather quickly (take that Miami).  I ordered the Thai-Coconut-Lime Chicken (Definitely  give it a try). It is a nice sized portion and it was delicious. It comes with regular rice but I decided to substitute the regular rice for brown rice instead (big mistake). The brown rice was soggy... Almost to the point of being a risotto. This is the only reason why I'm giving 4 stars.  If you like curry and a bit of spice in your food this is the plate to order. It also has bits of mango chunks.... Mmmmm Mmmmm good. I accompanied my food with red sangria (very refreshing).  My friend ordered a chargrilled New York steak with asparagus and mashed potoes.... She reports that her food was great and the steak very flavorful and juicy. Greta job!
Alicia R.,"Naples, FL",87,106,155,4.0,5/26/2017,"It's always hot or miss here, this time was ""hit""... I ordered the truffle grilled cheese sticks and they were delicious! I love truffle oil.... I also ordered a pear, blue cheese and caramelized onion flat bread, I'd definitely recommend both dishes. However stay far far away from the veggie burger lol..."
Meghan Z.,"Kansas City, MO",0,163,14,2.0,12/30/2017,It's a chain. It tastes like one and operates like one. Anyone going here knows that. Nothing spectacular to share nor negative. Always over crowded. Even a long wait to just buy cheesecake (the best thing on the menu) and go. There are plenty of other local bakeries with amazing cheesecake as well. Not a fan.
Elizabeth D.,"Naples, FL",23,57,28,4.0,11/23/2017,"I have eaten here twice so far and honestly I'm not in love with the food but it does give a satisfying feeling. The food is definitely on the saltier side but if you add some hot sauce or pepper flakes it is perfect. At first the prices seem way too high but when you see the portion sizes, they make more sense. Even with the huge portions, it is still on the pricey side, but let's be real. This is Naples. All in all, I'm not itching to come  back but I'd happily eat here again."
Charmin H.,"Naples, FL",54,58,294,3.0,7/23/2017,"There's not a time I come here and there isn't a wait. Wait time isn't that bad but be prepared to wait around until they find a table. They have a large menu with different varieties, which is great. The waiters are fairly nice but they sometimes look overworked. There's indoor and outdoor seating, and also a bar area where you can seat yourself. This restaurant is location right next to the coastland center mall (walking distance). Located 2 mins from downtown Naples. This place is great for breakfast, brunch, lunch and dinner. Get here early to avoid long wait time"
Foodie K.,"Irvington, NY",13,230,2250,5.0,3/28/2017,"Always great at a Cheesecake Factory. Last night we had the Chicken Madeira this time, Eggplant Parmesan and Chicken Bellagio. And of course the all time fave appetizer....Avocado Egg rolls!!! Have been at these restaurants since 1990 on the NE coast. Always great, always consistent. Dining on the patio was more comfortable than freezing cold inside.  Our server, Christian D. Last night was right in top of things. He was great. Thanks again Christian!!  Remember us? The two couples who took a long time to order and left 2 1/2 hours later. LOL. We won't see each other again till November."
Chris W.,"Louisville, KY",116,426,1703,4.0,7/24/2016,"Super awesome location and super awesome mall area in Naples.  Service was great, as was food.  Nice thing about Cheese Cake Factory is they are consistently good no matter where you visit.  So you know you will get a good meal and have lots of choices to choose from. I always like visiting various Cheese Cake Factories in various cities as they have a little of their own flare, also the bar areas can vary in size and setup."
Sharon F.,"Sarasota, FL",47,52,47,5.0,6/24/2017,"It was very crowded  at the Cheesecake Factory in Naples on Father's Day so I decided to sit on the patio. Thankfully they had several ceiling fans so it was very comfortable dining. I ordered the Thai lettuce wraps which I substituted with shrimp instead of chicken and they were fantastic as usual. My husband ordered chicken parmesan which was tenderized until it was very thin, it was perfect!  I tried my husband's key lime cheesecake and it was to die for!!!!! For it being so busy I was amazed of how great the service was. It was fast and and the employees worked well together on a very busy day. The manager checked on every table, they were on their game! You really can't go wrong going to a Cheesecake Factory."
Tommy M.,"Cape Coral, FL",12,126,20,4.0,9/24/2017,Took my girl out here for her b day dinner.  I had only one complaint when waiting on a table they tried to stick me in the corner by the door and the bar. But I was like a I'm going to need a better seat then this I can't believe they even would sit Simone here but they found me a better seat either the rest of the folks in the restaurant. Anyway food was great my waiter David was on point all night even with him singing happy b day to my girl was the best. He definitely needs to be getting props for his promptness and style. And the red velvet cheese cake was wonderful
Jane H.,"Marathon, FL",0,31,77,4.0,6/21/2017,Never dissappoints.  Busy for fathers day but plenty of space at the bar.  The wait was a bit long (not typical) but again it was a holiday.  Flat breads - wonderful as was the chicken piccante.  Will be back for more good eats!
Kenneth D.,"Tampa, FL",4,32,17,5.0,12/8/2016,Amazing food but very pricey. It's worth it on a day where you want to treat your wife ;-)  The Fettuccini Alfredo was incredible but what was really amazing was the appetizer! Fried mac and cheese balls! You must try it!
Just_me H.,"Naples, FL",0,80,11,3.0,4/29/2017,"Stopped in for lunch, Saturday afternoon about 130pm, restaurant seemed very busy. We were promptly and courteously greeted by a couple of the host staff and seated immediately. Our server was at the table immediately and took our drink order.  We ordered the spinach and artichoke heart app, which came out right away. Our order was then taken, and arrived almost as fast but we didn't feel rushed.  The service was impeccable, our drinks never got half empty before they were refilled. The food was.. ok. It wasn't bad in any way, the portions were definitely sufficient, the presentation was very nice , but not exciting flavor wise.  Again, it wasn't bad, but kind of plain, flat... Nothing jumped out at us as a favorite, or exciting.   It was a bit pricey for lunch with no alcohol but I need to stress that the service was top notch"
Thom P.,"Naples, FL",79,8,7,1.0,10/15/2016,"Food is terrible! Service just a step above unacceptable! Served store brand Apple juice as Apple cider... Table of 6 @$142 and both adults hated their food... Maybe a ok place for teenagers... menu way too big not to get any of the meals done as described. Chains are not my cup of tea, however this is one of the worst $150 meals I never ate!"
Gloria S.,"Naples, FL",382,817,2362,3.0,11/21/2015,"Why do I keep returning? I am a hopeful person married to an all American guy happy with a burger. However, he does love bread and claims their brown bread is the best., since it's served free at the tables, also hard to resist. I give an extra star for service but as for food, I am out of things to order as a gluten free vegetarian. I don't like their salad dressings. I gave into ordering the Miso Salmon which use to be a favorite.  Well, read this loud and clear, BRING YOUR OWN RICE! Previously they have had problems with the rice being hard, under cooked and cold. Don't they own a rice maker? Dump the cook who can't boil rice,  In addition, today when they had 3 chances to make it work, it did not. I thought I was being proactive when I asked for white instead of brown,  well, no go. Look at my pic and you will see what I did eat.  Also it all went downhill when they changed to the cheaper grain instead of having their original recipe of sticky rice.  It was not a pleasant experience, at these prices, again, not worth the gamble.  Again,why do I come?"
Adam L.,"Naples, FL",96,2,,5.0,11/8/2017,"Excellent food. Excellent service! Definitely will be back again. Ask for Miriam, she was a wonderful server!!"
Daniel P.,"Tallahassee, FL",254,714,4083,4.0,6/3/2016,"I must say, this was nothing like what I anticipated.  I had envisioned a schmaltzy operation (picture Village Inn's cake display) but I was very pleasantly surprised by an outstanding menu and definitive (if not downright platonic) cheesecakes. Very large menu.  Abundant depth of options across a broad set of categories. Daughter's birthday - so we got the clapping/whooping it up treatment from a number of the servers. TLH doesn't have one of these yet - but there are plenty of people who want one."
Va Beach M.,"Naples, FL",3,166,,5.0,7/8/2017,Same Cheesecake Factory as all the others in this large chain. Great food. Very delicious.
Chris D.,"Naples, FL",81,25,,4.0,7/22/2017,Always great food always great service good location to do some shopping in the area. Meals are a little pricey but the quantity and quality make up for it 100%
Jamie R.,"Naples, FL",653,1010,1058,4.0,9/17/2016,"This review is for the Chessecake Facory's signature cheesecakes.  Otherwise, I would be commenting on Pasta Factory, or Huge Portion Factory.   My house guests are huge fans of the Big Slices.  We popped in on Friday evening and spent a lot of time in front of the glass display case, oggling the many atmospherically high, cheesecake concoctions.  It appears that each cake must be named with a minimum of three words.  ""Oh So Good"" would never suffice, but immediately comes to mind.  We settled on two slices for the three of us to share:  Salted Carmel Crunch and something-something-Chocolate.  Pricey, perhaps, at $17 total, out the door, but we savored the value of fully enjoying the dessert and still having half a slice to hide in the refrigerator at home for ""later."""
Souad D.,"Sarasota, FL",16,70,150,4.0,6/5/2016,"After a full day shopping at the mall we worked out a good appetite for dinner! Cheesecake Factory is just across the street so it was close and convenient. Seating outside is nice, faces the mall parking lot with plenty of fans to keep you cool. The food was good..had the bang bang shrimp and chicken piccata and took home a slice of Adam's cheesecake. Service was fine.."
Kendall P.,"Altoona, FL",5,8,,3.0,6/22/2017,My lettuce wraps were delicious as always but my wife had the Cuban sandwich and it was all mayonnaise it was terrible. The manager came over and took a fork and pulled it apart at the table in front of us. I am sorry that was just wrong. The manager should have said she was sorry and taken to the kitchen to tear it apart. She was not nice at all. She needs table manners.
Kristina B.,"Novi, MI",1,51,16,4.0,6/1/2017,"My friend loves coming here every trip to Naples. Large menu with lots of variety so everyone will find something. I particularly enjoy their skinny menu, as they really make you think before you order since all menu items show the calorie intake. All the skinny items I have tried have been good and flavorful. Of course no trip is complete without their famous cheesecake, we have never been disappointed. Solid dinner choice."
Louise P.,"Vaughan, Canada",28,129,40,5.0,9/28/2016,"Always 4eva will love The Cheesecake Factory. Any time I visit the US I make sure to stop at one for a meal. I had a falafel salad and it was fa-nomenal. I would have eaten 12 of them. The falafel was really good, the lettuce and other ingredients were fresh, and the dressing was very complementary. The server was super nice and also never left my water glass empty (very important to me). Definitely will revisit :)."
Carrie G.,"Naples, FL",267,427,1125,3.0,11/23/2014,"This is such a huge place!  When we were there, almost all of the seats were empty, yet they seated us next to a family on both sides of us in a long booth style seating area.  We would have preferred to sit in a separate booth, but it was ok.  We had fun people watching... especially the couple next to us who never talked to each other- they just stared at their phones the whole time.  Nice.   I ordered the shepherds pie which was good.  They sure put a ton of meat in it!  I ate a lot, and I think there was still a pound of ground beef on my plate!   We ordered a slice of strawberry cheesecake for later.  sooooo gooood! :)  Even if you don't have any room for dessert, i suggest taking one to go because later you will be wishing you had it. :)"
P. W.,"Capannori, Italy",1,102,137,4.0,4/8/2016,Only 4 stars for the Cheesecake Factory. The reason? The price. We had appetite for excellent chese cake. We got the crazy carot cake. Tasted super! But $7.95 + tax for one (!) single slice of cake? OMG! Thank god we are on diet ... We will come bake later - but the orders will be smaller ...
Matthew O.,"Civic Center, Miami, FL",0,7,1,1.0,7/4/2016,"I'm rating this with 1 star simply because they do not have wifi. What kind of respectable, multimillion dollar chain restaurant doesn't carry wifi in the year 2016. Unacceptable. Get it together Cheesecake Factory. Also, they do not provide crayons or paper for children to draw with. Luckily, Alex, our exceptional server, provided us with pens and paper."
Daisy G.,"Jersey City, NJ",60,125,91,4.0,7/26/2016,"Very nice chain restaurant. I went for dinner on a Monday night and was seated within 5 minutes. My server was a little off and forgot our drinks, and we kinda felt rushed by him. I'm almost finished eating and he asked if we wanted dessert. The minute my dad finished he asked if we just wanted the check."
Joe J.,"Marlborough, CT",0,1,,1.0,8/30/2017,"Really like TCF overall and usually have great service, good food in any other one of their locations. Have tried the Naples location several times. No matter when we visited, food was not good and service was bad. Last visit was a take out order which we called in. Despite being charged for extras like ""spicy chicken"" on the house factory nachos and the same on the Mexican tortilla salad TCF still managed to not include them despite being charged for it. And on top of that the food we did get was terrible. How do you make a bad salad? Go to TCF Naples and find out for yourself. Even the $10 slice of cheesecake, which is what the place is named for, was terrible. Does anyone check the quality of the food served there? This place needs to change its management and hire better staff. Would not go here ever again. Bad."
Courtney N.,"New Castle, PA",0,9,,1.0,4/19/2017,"We just ate here tonight and it was busy. However, my husband and I had our two young children with us and it took over two and a half hours to eat.  It took forever to get our food, which was marginal at best.  By the time the food arrived it was obvious that it had been prepared some time ago and had been sitting under heat lamps.  Very disappointed.  The waitress seemed unaware and very unapologetic.  Won't be going back to this one.  Pricey and just about the worst service I've had at a restaurant.  Which we had walked out before the food arrived because it wasn't worth the wait."
Larry H.,"Naples, FL",1,67,8,2.0,3/1/2017,"Good food but way to expensive now.  I'll go to a nice restaurant and get a better meal, at a cheaper price.  I don't even recommend this place to friends anymore."
Patrick H.,"Naples, FL",1,9,2,4.0,2/16/2017,"Great service. Very attentive.  Pre-dinner cocktails were poured as requested.!! Excellent vodka martinis. The appetizers prior to dinner , served were spectacular. Would recommend this location for families and or dates."
Deisy C.,"Lehigh Acres, FL",340,23,136,2.0,8/16/2015,"Tonight we decided on cheese cake factory located at Coastland mall in Naples, fl. The parking was packed and so was the restaurant. We asked for a table for two, our wait would be 25-30 minutes but we ended up scoring a bar room table in less than 10 (I always get lucky with those grab and sit tables! Lol)  We were served water and bread right away but our bread plates didn't show up for at least 20 minutes. We ordered the steak Diane and Herb Salmon combination platter, which is my favorite.  When the food came out my boyfriend and I noticed how uneven both our plates were and how skimpy the steak was. When the waiter asked how everything looked I mentioned our disappointment but it was quickly dismissed with a ""ah well I hope it fills you up"". Everything was mediocre, the salmon had so many herbs and steams on it I had to scrap the top layer off and the steak was dry. I must say I've had better. The waiter passed by but not stopping at our table about 3 or 4 times holding a pitcher of water and not once refilled my water until I was done eating, I ended up having to stand up and grabbing a refill from the bar. Honestly terrible service.  Probably won't be back to this location for a while."
Dara E.,"Smithtown, NY",59,2,,5.0,4/15/2017,"Let me tell you about another experience at The Cheesecake Factory. Our waiter was either named Jack, Jake, or Zack. Despite not knowing his name, I liked him. Let me tell you why I felt this way about him. Everyone who goes to The Cheesecake Factory knows about the beloved brown bread. When I go with my friends, we often take a full loaf for each person. However, we quickly eat it and feel lost and confused, not knowing what to do without our brown bread. My pal and fellow The Cheesecake Factory enthusiast, Courtney, asked our waiter (name still unknown) for another basket of brown bread before he even finished pouring our water. He seemed overwhelmed at our eagerness to obtain more brown bread but quickly delivered his promise. However, we finished the bread once again and it was my turn to ask him for more. After I ordered my veggie burger (without cheese or mayo) I asked for more brown bread. Our waiter (name still not clarified) gave me what I like in a man. I asked him for brown bread and he only gave my brown bread. We got our main course and I was not disappointed, especially in the side of french fries I had the pleasure of consuming. The veggie burger had good flavor, texture, and was overall a good eating experience. As a vegan, I felt out of place watching my friends pick out their preferred cheesecakes. I didn't know how to react to not being able to eat cheesecake but I got through it. It's safe to say the restaurant provided a divine eating experience and my pants were not super super stretch after my meal."
Roxanne B.,"Lisbon, ME",60,59,97,5.0,3/20/2016,Our waitress was so good and so was our food. I love that it's a chain that actually serves consistently good food. We usually like to try to hip up local restaurants and try new things but we just needed something quick and reliable that wasted fast food because we were so hungry. The wide variety of choices never seems overwhelming which is nice. Their food is different then your average American fusion joint but not daunting or scary.
Denekia B.,"Lehigh Acres, FL",0,5,,1.0,7/21/2017,I am at wrk on break from the Coastland mall me and my co worker Kathy came to grab a bite to eat . The waitress was great however we both were told that our cards had been declined and that they both were not going through . They ran out card multiple times at different machines we are still here WAITING!! we are late going back to work this is my last time here.. ridiculous. It's clearly the machine NOT OUR CARDS !!!! we called our banks and the cards definitely have funds !!!! PISSED
Meghan D.,"Naples, FL",0,5,,3.0,7/13/2017,"This location I've eaten there three times while living in Naples for the past 5 months. The first time I ordered the Chicken Maderia it was amazing also ordered around lunchtime ! The second time however I ordered the honey truffle chicken around 8pm.  I have never had this dish before but it was disgusting. The chicken was bitter, the asparagus awful, and the mashed potatoes aka three hard things you couldn't even bite into. Needless to say it went in the trash. Also during this visit they forgot my cheesecake. Tonight, however I decided to stick to what I know and ordered the chicken maderia again. It was good but I would have liked my mashed potatoes a little less chunky. But the chicken amazing and so was the asparagus. Also around 8-9 pm. I recommend going earlier in the day for better mashed potatoes. Lol"
