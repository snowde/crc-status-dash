Steve E.,"Philadelphia, PA",23,246,42,1.0,8/12/2012,"Why did we have to wait 20 mins In a restaurant that was 3/4 empty? Had no idea why the long wait.  Food was average, nothing special at all. I think this franchise should concentrate on one thing, make it extremely good, and then start incorporating other ideas. It just seemed like the menu was bloated with unrelated items."
Jake V.,"Canton, MI",9,15,12,4.0,2/22/2014,"I've been to the Cheesecake Factory many times, and every time i would get the chicken teriyaki on too of a mound of white rice which was always good but I started to get annoyed with the portion of the chicken, every time it got small and smaller and you could definitely tell, and with the amount of rice there is, there just isn't enough teriyaki sauce to go around.  But this time I had the chicken Marsala over bow tie pasta...and folks it was something else I absolutely loved it and I believe I have found my new favorite. The pasta was unreal I ate all of that first. The Marsala wine sauce was just so delicious and that was all over the pasta and chicken, the chicken was so tender I could slightly put my fork down to cut it up. I highly recommend the chicken Marsala."
Philip H.,"Naples, FL",113,14,4,5.0,5/15/2013,Our church group went to CCF last Sunday...been there many times in the past year and it was again so terrific.  Food great...service great...prices great....wow.  I spilled some cream on the floor and they got it up almost instantly.  It was my birthday and they sang and brought a special dessert and it could not have been better. Food portions are very generous too....it is so good I can't hardly decide what to order. Go there and be happy everytime.  Phil H
Mireya A.,"Naples, FL",1,50,,2.0,8/1/2015,"Oh my lord another bad experience in Naples.  Ordered food to go, they told us 40 minutes we show up and wait and wait, girl comes out and takes our credit card we wait some more like 15 minutes no food.  Then the food comes out the girl says she thinks the order is not complete and checks in the bag and my shrimp scampi has no noodles.  Yep, she takes the food and disappears back into the restaurant, we wait another 10 minutes.  I have to get out and talk to a manager.  We finally get our food of course is cold.  Staying away for a while they have really gone down hill they used to have good food, and pretty good service."
Saadia P.,"Naples, FL",34,4,,5.0,8/5/2014,Always a treat ! i live near by and the hubby & i go there for date night  - Food is great & cheesecake is PERFECTION!
Dave H.,"Boca Raton, FL",1176,675,784,5.0,7/3/2013,Anyone who does not give TCF 5 stars is just lying to themselves. Best chain ever.
Filip D.,"Cape Coral, FL",3,48,,2.0,7/27/2011,"The fat waitress and dito waiter were rude and unfrienly. The food was cold (nachos, cuban sandwich and taquitas). After pauing a 15% tip, a short thank you or good bye would be on its place. Food is uncomplicated, but OK."
Ivette R.,"Miami, FL",268,1047,251,5.0,11/2/2014,"Just for the advice I'm not in Naples right now I'm just typing this review for the last time I visited this Cheesecake Factory location.This Naples Cheesecake Factory should be defined as the most awesome Cheesecake Factory in the History of the Universe.This location is awesome because it is very clean and the staff is very friendly.I went to this Naples Cheesecake Factory a couple months ago for memorial weekend.Me and the family stayed at the Vanderbilt Beach Resort on IMMOKALEE Rd not too far from there.After spending a whole day at the beach we decided to go to dinner here because we tried Buzz's Lighthouse across the street from the hotel but it was too crowded especially since it's such a tiny restaurant.So we went to the Cheesecake Factory at 2090 N Tamiami Trail Naples FL for a great evening dinner. This location is right in front of the Coastland Center Mall.The moment we walked in we were greeted by some jolly lady who seemed to be in a great mood.There was a 45 minute wait but trust me it's worth the wait and by the way we went on a Saturday night.I even remembered who are waitress was his name was Jerry I can't believe I remembered his name but I know why because he was the nicest waiter I've ever had in my life.Our Appetizers were delicious that day we ordered the Luau Salad that was really great.My Cheeseburger with fries were delicious and the S'mores Cheesecake we all ordered was delicious the Happy Hour specials are awesome and the Bartender was amazing I don't remember her name though overall this Naples Cheesecake Factory deserves 5 stars because the bathroom is clean including the whole restaurant,the staff is friendly and the food is delicious if u haven't been to Cheesecake Factory in Naples u should definitely go"
Maite H.,"Miami Lakes, FL",60,132,20,4.0,6/21/2013,Cheesecake factory never really disappoints and this one is in the perfect location for a bite after spending the day at the beach in Naples.  For Memorial Day Weekend it was pretty empty!  Service was great and the food was on point as always with this chain!
Valerie D.,"Cape Coral, FL",13,18,2,4.0,10/9/2013,"Food was great, service was great, and the location is lovely. No complaints really for the restaurant, except for where we sat. This is about the kind of people we sat next to. The tables (not booths) are in very close proximity to each other, and it's where they stick people with small children who need to be in high chairs....unless you like spending an evening with screaming infants trying to stick their hands in your plate while you're eating (yes, that's how close they were)"
Sherona E.,"Fort Myers, FL",2,5,,2.0,10/3/2013,"I am normally a huge fan of The Cheesecake Factory but this time I decided to venture out from the Miso Salmon top pick and satisfy my craving for a Mexican style dish. Wrong choice, I ordered the Factory Burrito Grande and it was not tasty at all. The size of the Burrito was true to the name on the menu, for it was truly a big size. even though it was a big size, I would have been more pleased if it was a lesser size and packed with more flavor packed seasonings. I am still a fan of The Cheesecake Factory, but I will not order that selection from the menu ever again."
Erin W.,"Marshall, MI",0,3,,5.0,12/19/2013,This is my favorite restaurant! The avocado egg rolls are the best....ever! Wait staff was nice. Menu is huge so be prepared to take your time looking through it.
Tracy P.,"Byron Center, MI",0,29,,4.0,10/12/2014,"Food was okay, nothing really special. The Godiva chocolate cheesecake and the mango key lime cheesecake were amazing."
Jason D.,"Rocky Mt, VA",39,34,2,1.0,9/11/2013,"Naples is notorious of closing up early, so wife and I were pleased that The Cheesecake Factory stayed open later.  We arrived 1hr and 45min before closing. The main reason we came here was for the cheesecake, but wanted to first have a meal.  We were promptly greeted and lead to our seats. The waitress finally asked for our drink orders 5 min later and never asked about an appetizer, which we had to flag her down and request. A female manager begins to yell at her staff for something that she has repeated had to tell them. There is a time and place for everything, and that may of been the time but certainly not the place. It is obvious that the staff did not care about the manager or their jobs, because they spent entirely too much time gossiping at the front with one another and little to no attention to their customers.  The food comes out and it is 4 star worthy. No complaints about the food. With 45min remaining before they close, the same Latino female manager starts talking to herself, ""Okay, let's start getting these folks out of here.""  I could tell that she was surprised to see us sitting there in hearing distance.  Now, the real reason was for cheesecake, but now we are so agitated about the service and disrespect, we paid our bill and went and bought ice cream."
Steve S.,"Naples, FL",37,188,57,3.0,3/12/2011,i dont know....i like the cheesecake factory... but its been hit or miss lately... the stuffed mushrooms were great... chicken croquettes not so much... and the service has been ok...and its been not so much... last time a few weeks ago..great.. this saturday not.. we ordered 2 apps..only one showed up.. we asked for the other one.. just after that  half the dinners show up..except mine..few minutes later the other app does..still no sign of my plate..finally after a few more mine finally does...with a weird thing i noticed..the plate is very hot too the touch but the food is barely still warm???? oh and bartender knocked over a glass..after about 10 mins of 5 different people walking thru it... somebody comes from the back and scoops up some of it with a menu.. no broom in sight...
Elle T.,"Naples, FL",0,16,4,5.0,3/11/2009,I have been to 2 different locations. One in downtown Chicago and the one down here by Coastland Mall.  I have to say the value for the buck I got from the one in Chicago made me check out the one down here. I was truly impressed by both locations.  The food tastes great and its cheap. Also it fills the plate not like one of those places where you pay $50 for food that takes 2 sq inches of your plate.  I tried the Teryaki Chicken and Ceaser Salad. At the end I had to have the Tiramisu Cheesecake. Just delish
Kristen B.,"Medina, OH",2,5,1,1.0,8/30/2012,"Tonight in Naples, Florida, I had the unfortunate experience of dealing briefly with the staff in the bar area. I say briefly because 3 servers passed on the opportunity to serve me. Initially, at 7:30 pm on Thursday, I asked to sit outside and was denied because they'd stopped serving outside. So, I sat at a hightop in the bar area. First server asked me if the bartender (Ross or Russ) had helped me yet. I said no. Then he asked me if Tiffany had helped me. Again, I said no. Then he yelled to Tiffany that she had a table and she replied that she already had 6 tables. She then attempted to ask the bartender to serve my table because she was too busy, and he said no because he had to use the restroom. (Mind you, I was alone...just ONE person and all I wanted was cheesecake and coffee.) This ALL happened right in front of me. I heard every word. Obviously, I got up and left. I let the hostess know that I wasn't pleased. There are many, many restaurants in Naples. Just sayin'.  Thank you..."
AJ R.,"Naples, FL",0,16,,5.0,11/11/2013,Normally always perfect.  I love to order the lettuce wraps and orange chicken.  Fun to go during lunch or a late dinner.
Sydney P.,"Naples, FL",14,92,2,5.0,12/11/2007,"Hey listen I know it's the Cheesecake Factory and they're everywhere, &  not technically Naples Fare, but for a delicious meal, good service, and amazing value, it's definitely worth your time. Especially great for large groups. I have been sort of avoiding it because I like to try all the ""local"" spots, but we ducked in here after some Christmas shopping, I almost fell over when we were seated in 5 mins ( on a Saturday night!!!) I have always had to wait at least an hour or more in other places.  Our waitress was awesome, the food was delicious, creative and I was eating  ( good!)  Shrimp Scampi & Steak Diane for $19.00. Not 50 bucks, so you have to love that. We did the cheesecake too of course, always yummy. They do have outdoor seating , however it overlooks the mall parking lot,  so no on that...I always think the insides of these are really pretty though. Good comfortable tables & booths. Just thought I'd share-"
Micah C.,"San Clemente, CA",3,32,2,2.0,10/27/2009,it is usually pretty good... but this time it was a mes. maybe it was the fact that 15 minutes after ordering our sandwiches and salads that  we had to remind our absent-minded waiter to put in our order.   10 minutes later we got our caesar salads.... the dressing was bitter and hardly a hint of anchovies :( (my sweetie's fav)    another 10 minutes later i recieve my cold-cut turkey club and she gets her portobello sandwich.... wait a sec! that's not what she ordered :(   another 10 minutes later my UNHAPPY and HUNGRY sweetie finally gets the eggplant sandwich she ordered.   i was disappointed with the food. turkey was boring and the eggplant mushy and chewy all at the same time. the waiter was full of excuses... but the pros were that the manager graciously comp'd her sandwich... which i still had to remind our waiter to take off the initial billing attempt the atmosphere was pleasant and i'm sure the cheesecake is to die for... but we couldn't take any more disappointment and excuses
