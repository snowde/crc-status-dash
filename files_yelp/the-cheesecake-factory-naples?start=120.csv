Brook B.,"Naples, FL",0,5,,1.0,5/28/2012,I love The Cheesecake factory but this experience was horrible!!! Every piece of silverwear on our table was dirty. I'm talking filthy! Then when we told our waitress she had an attitude like we were wasting her time! Even the two tables around us were complaining of dirty silverwear. This was a discusting experience today! I can only imagine if this was the front of the house how are they keeping the back of the house! Come on management keep your establishment clean!!!!!!!!
James L.,"Waukesha, WI",0,2,,4.0,2/25/2012,"Good happy hour drinks and appetizers, but I think the cheesecake slices shrunk."
Pat M.,"Naples, FL",0,5,,3.0,11/8/2012,The food is okay just like the rest of its franchises. Happy hours offer good deals for those who like the appetizers. There isn't anything special except for their big portions.
Pepe P.,"ON, Canada",0,24,,1.0,8/17/2011,"I have been to other cheesecake factory locations, and always had a good experience. Not this time. The waitress had an attitude, an the food was nothing to write home about.Over priced, and very poor attention to detail. First and last time I go to this location."
