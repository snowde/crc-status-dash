Chef N.,"Naples, FL",0,48,,2.0,7/16/2016,"We normally enjoy the CCF. The one in Orlando has been excellent every time we went. The one in Naples not so much. Our service was unacceptable. Seemed like the waitress just didn't care. Silverware was unclean. The replacements were the same way. Finally the third set was ok. No refills of drinks. The main meal was lukewarm. The food was ok, but my carrot cake was stale.  We have been here twice - separated by a year. We won't go back."
Soleil K.,"Olympia Fields, IL",110,209,705,5.0,7/6/2015,"ABSOLUTELY DELISH! No wait for being seated and our waitress was so kind. The tex Mex rolls were so good for an appetizer. Any Jamaican entree is going to be good no doubt. And for dessert, I had a sundae and my husband had the brownie sundae. Talk about delish. It was a prefect lunch"
John A.,"Xàbia, Spain",0,1,,5.0,6/29/2017,"Lovely venue, large cheesecakes selection, couldn't finish mine as too big, so ask for a second spoon and doggie box to take away"
Doron S.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",10,24,41,4.0,5/29/2016,Wow! Just a wonderful place to dine at. Truly remarkable service. Waiters/waitresses are very polite and greeting. Love this restaurant and how the lighting is dim and reading. Food is certainly delightful and I definitely recommend eating here because the menu has a variety of foods that will fulfill your stomachs desires. This restaurant is so great that it's always so very full. Only reason I give it a 4 star rating is because of the poor amount of seating for when you wait and it's very crowded.
Jamie K.,"Naples, FL",72,614,5,4.0,11/25/2015,"A typical Cheesecake restaurant. Huge portions, above average prices, long meals, big menu, and elaborate decor. Seated right away and drink order taken immediately. Warm bread and passion tea delivered fast. Great brown bread and sour dough and the passion iced tea is my all time favorite. Huge menu or book as it is. There is so much on the menu I love that it is hard select. Veggie burger was good and large, piping hot. Spinach dip is my favorite with salty warm chips. Mushroom soup is awesome on Wednesday. Chris' cheesecake is my favorite too with coconut and chocolate. Big selection of cheesecake and deserts, worth it, just for desert. Always consistent and good. Prices could be lower, but there are always leftovers for tomorrow."
Asma A.,"Fort Myers, FL",6,76,30,4.0,6/2/2016,"It's a really beautiful restaurant especially the location in Naples, I tried many dishes and never impressed but the cheesecake is always good and amazing also the espresso and coffee cappuccino  always good, the best cheese cake is the strawberry one and the chocolate cheese cake amazing!"
Carla S.,"East Hanover, NJ",33,176,113,5.0,7/21/2016,We love this place. It's always consistent.  When we're at the mall we always go here for lunch.
Arlene H.,"Naples, FL",325,130,336,3.0,7/8/2014,"UGH! I'm so torn with how I feel about this place.  And, personally, I rarely have the gumption to write about a large chain unless I find that golden nugget of light that I must share with the world. Cheesecake=Perfection.  Hands down.  I'm usually in the mood for their red velvet cheesecake, or anything chocolate.  I tried the Godiva chocolate cheesecake and it came with a foil-wrapped piece of chocolate.  Heavenly.  We typically order cheesecake as a to-go item and here's a little tidbit that I can share with you.  One piece is usually too big for one person.  They'll split it right down the middle and put it in two separate containers with their own dollop of whipped cream.  How 'bout that?! Now, for dinner service.  There are no black napkins to be found in the restaurant, so make sure you're wearing a lighter color or don't care about white lint on your black outfit.  Customer service can tend to be a little spotty.  I attribute this to the vastness of the restaurant.  For food's sake, stick to what you know.  Order whatever your cheesecake factory staple is to make you happy. I was coerced into going off the beaten path and I ordered  their Sunday brunch item which was their crab hash.  The dish looked great, and it came with real crab, but the problem was that it had an unpleasant smoky flavor to it and there was an excess of liquid either from the poached eggs or from the lump crab.  Now I'm the antithesis of a picky eater, and it was hard getting through this meal. The company that I was with had Elvis' belgian waffles all nice and fluffy and clad with peanut butter, banana slices and.....dun dun dunnn....pieces of bacon.  My partner in crime had their healthy man-portion of a Monte Cristo. Here are my menu suggestions if you have NEVER been to a Cheesecake Factory: Tuscan Chicken (off their Skinnylicious menu) -  Grilled Chicken Breast with Tomatoes, Artichokes, Capers, Fresh Basil and Balsamic Vinaigrette. Served Over Fresh Vegetables and Farro Avocado Egg Rolls - Avocado, Sun-Dried Tomato, Red Onion and Cilantro Fried in a Crisp Wrapper. Served with a Tamarind-Cashew Dipping Sauce. Miso Salmon - Fresh Miso Marinated Salmon Served with Snow Peas, White Rice and a Delicious Miso Sauce. Chicken Bellagio - Crispy Coated Chicken Breast over Basil Pasta and Parmesan Cream Sauce Topped with Prosciutto and Arugula Salad Now, go forth and fill those bellies!"
Gerry H.,"Naples, FL",0,3,,4.0,3/15/2017,"Went to the Cheesecake Factory in Naples last night for the first time and was favourably impressed, although I found the cocktails overpriced but very good (Mai Tai was $12.50, JW's Pink Lemonade was $11.50). We were a party of 5 and we were seated within 10 minutes. Our server Violeta was very attentive and got all of the orders right, including breaking up the bill into 4 separate checks which was no problem. I had the Shepherd's Pie which was awesome.....very tasty and large portion. My wife had the Crispy Chicken Cosoletta which she said was also very good (3 pieces of chicken). It was too much for her to finish, so we took it home along with the cheesecake that we had to try even though we were more than full. All in all, a great place to eat!"
Danet R.,"Miami, FL",8,25,102,5.0,7/13/2016,"Really fresh delicious dishes, the menu is huge,  the service fast and excellent costumer service."
Anja S.,"Freiberg, Germany",0,4,3,4.0,9/21/2015,My family and I came here twice during our vacation because we enjoyed it so much! During our first visit we tried 3 pieces of cheese cake and could barley finish them with 5 people. Everything tasted awesome and the peanut butter cheesecake send me to peanut heaven. I really recommend trying as much different cakes as possible! During our second stop we came for lunch. The place was really crowded so we had to wait before we could be seated. I really like the variety of food they serve in the cheese cake factory. The lettuce wraps as starters are something you can't get everywhere. I recommend trying them!  Every dish is served lovely and you can see and taste that a lot of thought went into the creation of the dish. I had the California cheese steak sandwich but also loved my moms tacos with the tasty avocado rice. One star less because it gets really noisy if the restaurant is full and you can't understand all the things other people at your table are saying. So come when there's no crowd and enjoy the lovely food ;)
Danny S.,"Bonita Springs, FL",0,7,2,4.0,1/31/2016,"Love coming here with friends and family. The menu is great. There is so much to choose from. Fish tacos, meatloaf, Nachos, orange chicken, macaroni and cheese burger (personal favorite) and cheese cake of any kind.  I also enjoy the interior design very nicely done.  It's definitely a space the grabs your attention.  The drinks are great too. All the beer and mix drinks you could want  Even if your just going for cheese cake it's definitely worth it!!!"
MC C.,"Candiac, Canada",0,6,1,5.0,8/16/2016,"Great location near the mall, you can shop and then go eat. Good portions of food for the price  . It is known for its cheesecakes and they are delicious We usually aren't hungry to eat a cheesecake right after but we take it to go and eat it later. My favourite is the pecan, caramel and turtle one. For the food, the tamales are full of mexican flavour as well as the fish tacos. There is a skinnylicious menu that show you options with 550 calories or less for a meal.Great service every time we went."
Artiium A.,"Waldorf, MD",61,30,66,5.0,1/17/2016,"Always a great treat when I go, this time it was just a dessert date with my wife and all we wanted was the Cheesecake. I got the Lemon-Raspberry cheesecake and my wife got the Oreo Dream Cheesecake, mine is great and her is delicious!! I'm not a chocolate kind of guy but her is really good not overbearing sweet, the right balance! We took it home and I enjoyed it with a big glass of raw milk!"
Rachael J.,"Naples, FL",93,60,161,4.0,8/8/2015,"Huge place, always busy therefore service is hit or miss. But they've got good food and LOTS to choose from. Buffalo Blasts and Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes are my go-to here. Don't forget a slice of cheesecake! My favorite is Craig's Crazy Carrot Cake cheesecake."
Bill H.,"Naples, FL",37,409,35,4.0,4/12/2014,"Great service - fast, friendly and efficient! We had the garlic noodles and chicken Di Pana; both were delicious. Large portions for the price.  You will definitely bring home leftovers.  Nice ambiance at this location.  Large menu - too many items to choose from. We'll be back."
Fabian D.,"Alphen aan den Rijn, The Netherlands",12,184,331,4.0,9/5/2015,Nice place and good location in Naples. It was near our hotel. The burgers are great but I missed some green salad. Of course it was my decision to have fries in stead of salad. The gombo with chicken and gambas tasted good as wel. Of course you have to eat one of the cheesecakes. The are not to big but it is too much after a main course. So share one. The staff is friendly. The floor of te restaurant need a big clean up. It was very slippery.
Amy M.,"Bonita Springs, FL",21,35,98,5.0,8/28/2015,My first time here. I'm really enjoy happy hours. They came big portion. I love it a lot. I sat at the bar with my sister. The bartender is very nice. I love cheese cake. I will be back here again soon.
Black L.,"Naples, FL",6,16,57,5.0,8/17/2014,"so, i got attracted by this place when i saw their giant menu online, so i suggest everyone should choose what they wanna have waaay before you get there, 'cause it's gonna take you a while.  Me and my friend we started with a flatbread, with tomato and mozarella, very nice. Afterwards i ordered the Meatloaf, which comes with mashed potatoes and corn ( the best corn!! ), and my friend got the Shepard's Pie, delicious and a million flavors , just like homemade food. So, we had all this for 32$, not bad for a full delicious hot lunch. Of course there's cheaper choices, all depending on what you crave for, but im sure everything is good there."
Richard L.,"Spring Branch, TX",43,35,46,4.0,4/3/2015,Never lets you down with options for any eater. As a foodie i was able to tempt my pallet with an awesome curry dish while my kids enjoyed burgers and fried food. Of course the cheese cake is out of this world.  Service was perfect and the location was clean and comfortable. I highly recommend this restaurant especially if you have a team of people who have different tastes and have a sweet tooth.
