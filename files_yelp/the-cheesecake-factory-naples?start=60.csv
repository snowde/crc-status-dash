Kim B.,"Naples, FL",4,6,1,5.0,4/3/2015,"I always enjoy my meal, the service is outstanding, and if it is cocktail hour you should definitely try the Mia Tai's! We like to get there for happy hour and the $5.00 appetizers."
Robert G.,"Beals, ME",16,146,5,4.0,3/7/2016,"The atmosphere and decor is top notch and it is very clean looking.  We had been hesitant about going there because we are on a strict diet, but were surprised that they have a special, low calorie menu which we ordered from.  My wife had a flatbread pizza with tomatoes and basil and I had a hamburger which came with a salad.  Everything was good.  A funny thing happened when my wife asked about pepper (meaning hot red pepper) for her pizza.  The young waitress, who was from the islands, came back with a black pepper grinder and applied it to her pizza.  We did not say a word!"
Patricia W.,"Punta Gorda, FL",7,169,269,4.0,4/29/2015,"Very busy place. Good portions, meatloaf really good, steak Diane very good.  Then there's dessert. Too many choices, all   drink pricy. Scotch rocks. $11.00.more than most places."
David B.,"Whittier, CA",6,87,106,1.0,4/5/2015,"I'm not a big fan of chain restaurants because they lack an identity. Usually they are consistent with food quality and service but that was not the case here. My uncle and I ordered nachos and a couple of drinks. The nachos were just ok but I could tell the pico de gallo and guacamole were old and discolored. Bread service was fine here but it took too long for our drinks to arrive. The Cambria Chardonnay they pour by the glass was very good and tasted like the bottle had just been opened.  Dinner was awful. I returned my Chinese chicken salad. The chicken was mealy, the fried garnishes( cellophane noodle and fried wontons) were stale and the salad was over dressed. My uncle's filet mignon was not properly trimmed. They left the chain on the filet so there was silver skin and fat when there should have been none. We had those little filth flies at our table which means they either have standing water somewhere or a trash problem.  The waitress delivered a glass of Pinot Noir wine that had lip stick on it.  She returned to the table with a ""new glass"" too quickly. I told my uncle she either wiped the glass clean or poured his wine into a new glass. He agreed with me and wasn't thrilled with the insight. I ordered plain cheesecake and it was excellent. It just wasn't enough to save an already bad meal."
Za Z.,"Naples, FL",0,35,3,4.0,5/22/2015,"Still a fan.  About the only chain restaurant that I go to at all. Tried the Shepherd's Pie this time.  Large and very tasty.  Peas still had a nice bite to them. Companions loved the Renee's Special - 1/2 Chicken Almond Salad sandwich, awesome Chicken Tortilla Soup(crisp chips, beautifully fresh cilantro, nice rich broth), and a nice salad. Overall, very happy. Stephanie, our server was fun, patient, and juggled multiple tables very well.  Excellent service!"
Ashley S.,"Naples, FL",3,12,9,5.0,5/7/2015,"great place  great food  great seating great service it was a little pricey but not bad. The indoor seating was great but the outdoor seating over looks a parking lot so it's not very pretty. There are many choices for cheesecake and entrees, they also have a ""skinny"" menu so that was good.  I would definitely recommend this place but not to someone on a budget or who wants some great scenery."
PJ S.,"Naples, FL",0,18,,4.0,9/2/2016,"I normally am not a fan of The Cheesecake Factory, but I must say when I went there with my daughter recently we had the best experience. I always order water with lime and most of the time I get water with lemon or just water, as wait staff aren't always the best listeners. So when I ordered my usual water with lime and our waitress Joetta D repeated our order back to us ""I'll be back with two waters, one with lime."" I knew we had a good waitress. Joetta D is the best!! Our food was delicious and we had a wonderful time. We still had shopping to do at the Mall and they even stored the cheesecake I purchased to take home in their refrigerator for me to pick up after we finished shopping. Thank you Cheesecake Factory and Joetta D for making our lunch experience fun! :)"
Jennise V.,"Fernley, NV",37,128,78,4.0,10/14/2015,"The food was pretty great & the drinks were awesome!! The cheesecake, as expected, was phenomenal!! The chicken was a bit dry, but other than that, it was pretty good."
Alfredo A.,"Naples, FL",16,6,,1.0,7/10/2016,"Today family decided to eat here, and was very disappointed.  Wife and I order the the Blackened Jamaican chicken plate. No matter what Cheese Cake Factory we go to we are always delighted to get this plate. Today was very disappointing. Presentation of plate was horrible. (Dirty plates) we barely received any Chicken and mango salsa, and the rice was very hard. (Couldn't even eat). Not to mention I found a french  fry in my plate. We didn't even order fries! When we mentioned this to the waitress it was not a concern for her. We still tipped her and paid for the food, but unfortunately will not be returning to this location again."
Tj K.,"McLean, VA",0,16,1,5.0,5/24/2015,"While I usually do not write reviews for chain restaurants, this one was deserving of some recognition due to the exceptional service and ambiance.  While the menu and food quality is similar at most Cheesecake Factory restaurants - thanks in large part to  quality control and training inherent with being a successful restaurant chain - this Cheesecake factory has wonderful service, an amazing patio, and just nice ambiance all around.  The mojito ordered was amazing.  One of the best mojito's we have ever had - perfectly sweetened and garnished with plenty of mint and lime - just what the doctor ordered for a warm Naples evening.  The food was solid and lived up to the Cheesecake Factory standards we have all come to expect."
Nancy D.,"Naples, FL",0,2,,2.0,1/1/2015,"The food is good but they need to work on cleanliness  As I was about to sit a fork on the floor, not a big deal but as I walk walking to bathroom there was dirty floors once I got to the bathroom no toilet tissue in one stall the other stall someone had urinated on the seat & this is the woman's bathroom  This is an eating establishment & it worries me because what does that tell you about the kitchen... Would think twice about going Please management clean- it is a good franchise Thanks"
Joseph L.,"Melrose, MA",0,23,2,5.0,6/19/2014,Always great service and great food. Appetizers were very good - I'd recommend the tuna tartare (even though it's one of the smaller apps) and avocado eggs rolls . Louisiana chicken pasta is amazing - highly recommend if you like crispy chicken cutlets and somewhat spicy food.
Rachel I.,"Naples, FL",56,47,130,5.0,5/26/2014,"Been coming here since it opened (way back in elementary school!) My family travels a lot, and given our great experiences here, we frequently visit other locations of the Cheesecake Factory, which are never up to par with ours locally. The service and food at this location are both outstanding. In my 20+ visits, I've never had less than a great experience. For those new to the chain in general, take comfort in the fact that the staff is always open to your questions, and in my experience, the kitchen staff as well has always been great about substitutions for my food allergies. The expansive menu (nearing a hundred items I've heard) also makes a newcomer feel welcome as you will definitely find something for you. My older sister worked at this location for a few years when it first opened and still says years later that it is the only restaurant of the 8+ she's worked at that is near spotless, even in the areas guests wouldn't see (which gains it another star simply for overall cleanliness). Overall, a five star experience every time."
Stephen R.,"Toms River, NJ",0,13,1,3.0,1/11/2016,Went here 2 separate times while visiting Naples. Food was good but they forgot something both times we went there and completely lost/forgot to put an order in for one of the members of our party. Kind of ridiculous when your main responsibility as a server is to just take an order. Go there only if you have patience and are very forgiving.
Rafael F.,"Naples, FL",14,91,4,4.0,9/18/2015,"You can't go wrong here. On both occasions that we were here, the food was great. Portions are on the huge side, but that's the appeal here. Service is good here but it's all business. Cheesecake slices are way too big in my opinion. Nice ambiance. A sure bet."
Christina V.,"Homestead, FL",9,20,10,5.0,7/6/2014,"We went here on our honeymoon and again when we came back to naples many years later. The food is amazing, I had the skinny shrimp tacos and grilled artichoke. Husband had a burger. We were so stuffed but had to get some cheesecake to go. The waitresses timing was impeccable and even though I felt I was picky with my order she accommodated my every need. This location is a bit more quiet than the one we go to in Miami but I like it better. A++++"
Chris V.,"New Lenox, IL",0,37,1,2.0,3/30/2016,Dirty floor on the patio and the service was very slow...this location is struggling tonight.
Tatiana T.,"Naples, FL",4,5,,5.0,3/13/2015,This place is amazing. Wonderful staff and such a comfortable and peaceful place wether it's for a date or a friends night out. It's wonderful for any occasion there menu is awesome and the cheesecakes are just to die for... Keep up the good work you guys are the best....
Anthony T.,"Myrtle Beach, SC",7,19,29,2.0,5/25/2015,This is the worst Cheesecake Factory I have ever been to! Waited 40 mins for food and it was cold! Server was no help at all. The fact that it was slow in there! No excuses for lousy service and cold food!
Francois G.,"Dania Beach, FL",15,3,,1.0,7/25/2015,"Wow. My boyfriend got a chicken pasta dish that was really good.   Halfway eating it, he found a shrimp and I am deadly allergic to fish/shellfish.  I tasted his dish. We spoke to the manager and he simply apologized. I could have choke to death!!!!!!!! The chef even came to apologize. They should have comp at least one meal.  Or a free dessert.   NOTHING.  They were like ""oups, sorry"".   I own a restaurant, if my manager would have done this I would have fired him."
