Elizabeth P.,"Naples, FL",10,31,5,5.0,4/12/2015,"Absolutely loved it! It was my first time experiencing the restaurant and thought everyone was their food was great (12 people), service was overall 4.5 outta 5. I'm hoping to go back again soon. The place is very spacious and we were seated quickly."
Michelle M.,"Fort Myers, FL",102,84,62,5.0,2/28/2015,"We stopped in for lunch and ended up ordering dinner food. I got the Shepard's Pie and he got the combo of Steak Diane and Madeira Chicken. We were thrilled, both meals were plentiful, had great flavor, and the service was pretty good given that they were quite busy. We were completely full after the large portions so brought leftovers and of course, a piece of cheesecake home. Overall very happy and wish we would have gone there sooner. We are already anticipating going back soon!"
Pete W.,"Naples, FL",64,6,,1.0,1/6/2016,I've never eaten at any Cheesecake Factory without feeling sick and instantly regretting my decision. Only thing that is edible is the cheese cake itself.
Jamie C.,"Naples, FL",0,2,,2.0,10/18/2016,"I've been in the service industry for over 10 years, so the only time I really ever write one of these is when I appreciate amazing service, but this was way different! I don't think I have ever had such a horrible experience in a restaurant. Our server walked by us several times before finally telling us she would be right with us. About 5 minutes later, a nice women came over to take our drink order and told us Kim would be our server and she was a little busy. Which I understand. I get it. We waited way over 10 minutes just for Kim to come over with our not so great drinks and zero apology for taking so long. So we ordered our salad appetizer and our entrees all at once. We got our salad a couple minutes later which was nice because by this time, we were starving. Soon after, we got our entrees. My boyfriend ordered the filet mignon medium rare and it came so rare, that it was literally purple throughout and had more fat on it than meat. Our server asked how everything was, we said it was good only because my salmon was amazing (which is the only reason this review has more than one star) and my boyfriend was starving and didn't want to wait to send it back. She told us she would be right back to fill our waters, never did until the very end when we asked for the check. She wasn't even nice to make up for her horrible service. Lets just say, our tip reflected how we felt about her. My birthday dinner was not as great as I anticipated."
Stephan T.,"Hamburg, Germany",1,182,58,4.0,11/7/2013,"Nice evening. Good Service, nice food. Ok it´s just a chain, but with Cheesecake Factory you never failed. Allways good food. I toke the Fettucini with chicken and sun-dried tomatos and my wife take a Thai Noodle dish. For drink I choose a virgin pina cholada and my wife a diet coke. The service was very nice and helpfull. Just 4 stars because all Cheescake Factorys are very loud and flutter."
William S.,"Fraser, MI",36,272,66,4.0,2/5/2014,"Since my wife and I have never tried this place, we decided to stop in for a late night snack while on vacation in Southwest Florida. The place is really nice and bigger than I would've imagined.  We waited for a table even though while being seated in about 10 mninutes we noticed there was a lot of seats available that were vacant.  Somebody doesn't seem to be doing their job. Regarding the food, I can honestly say, I've sinned.  Those desserts are truly sinful.  I had the pineapple upside down cheesecake.  It was simply amazing and like nothing else I've ever had.  I also had a tropical smoothy which was delightful as well.   Our server was stellar and friendly! I guess my only complaint would be that the prices were a bit high."
Jason A.,"Suwanee, GA",0,7,1,2.0,4/6/2016,The food was decent but the cheesecake was absolutely delicious. It took awhile to figure out what I wanted as there was way to many options. Our waiter was really nice the last time we came but there is one waiter there that is just terrible and we cringe every time we see her. It took us way too long to get our free bread and we had our meal before we had the bread. Overall a pleasant experience but every time I go its different.
Joe W.,"Justin, TX",132,525,300,3.0,8/5/2013,"If for some reason you haven't ever been to the Cheesecake Factory, you are missing out on what shall be called ""The King of Deserts"".  I can't say their food is off the charts, but their deserts by far is second to none. With over 15 types of gourmet cheesecakes to choose from, and several regular gourmet cakes. You have way more than your fair share of deserts to choose from, and they range from $7.95 - $8.95 a slice."
Patty O.,"Naples, FL",0,18,,1.0,8/19/2014,"Was a loyal fan until......gut busting food poisoning. After a night semi-conscious next to the toilet, I'll never be able to eat here again. I had the turkey club- several culprits in there."
Louis P.,"Windermere, Orlando, FL",0,26,13,1.0,3/24/2016,"Poor service by ill-equipped waitress.  Ran out of spaghetti and meatballs, never telling us there was a problem until everyone had been served, poor grandma had no dinner and no explanation or solution for 15 minutes. Manager comes out with arms crossed and begins an episode of the people's court in front of everyone over a few slices of stake cheesecake that should have been complimentary for poor grandma.  Will never return as our grandmother was fully embarrassed and we were disgusted.  Manager and waitress need to go back to hospitality school.  Terrible!"
Alyssa N.,"Naples, FL",172,10,,4.0,4/1/2016,"My boyfriend and I have been coming here for some time. We started coming for late night cheesecake dates since the restaurant is open so late. We started coming here for meals and we've always loved our food. My last visit I requested a special order of the filet mignon and shrimp scampi and it was to die for. I ate the whole thing! I've heard of a few bad experiences from some friends of mine, but I haven't yet had a bad experience. I've also never had a problem with the staff. They've all been super pleasant with exuberant knowledge of the menu, and always lead me in the right direction. My favorite cheesecake is the white chocolate raspberry one, which I get every time! My boyfriend and I always go the day before valentine's day as a tradition, which is always really busy but the longest we've waited was 45 minutes and it went by quickly. The long wait didn't slow down the staff or the food coming out to us."
Kat E.,"Oakland, CA",0,109,,1.0,1/2/2013,"I will never come back to this location again. Ever. Do yourself a favor and read my review and then decide if you want to eat here. My boyfriend and I got seated and waited for 25 minutes for the waitress to finally come over and take our order for an appetizer and drinks (keep in mind we had no drinks or bread). We wait another 10 minutes and she brings one water to the table. We had ordered two waters since there are TWO people, but... Whatever. We ordered our dinner plates at this point. Another 20 minutes pass and our appetizer arrives with my boyfriend's water. We take a bite of the Crispy Taquitos and they are cold and chewy. Our waitress is nowhere to be seen since she last gave us our water and hasn't refilled it once. I noticed a manager walking by our table and asked him if we could please get another appetizer since ours was cold and practically uncooked. He grabbed the plate and walked away. Another 20 minutes pass and the waitress is still nowhere to be found. My boyfriend and I have been sitting at this table for over a hour waiting for any type of food to be served or our drinks to be refilled and I was getting a little annoyed. I noticed another manager walking by and told him what the situation was (omitting the waitress being MIA because I didn't want to get her in trouble... Though her customer service was nonexistent). The manager glares at me and says, ""Anyone could have helped you with that"" as if I'm a child. Now I want to make this point clear, if I'm telling a manager of a restaurant a situation that I think needs his attention it's not because I'm impolite or I regularly complain about restaurant staff (I used to be a waitress, I get it). I am telling him this because he is in a position to do something about it and make our experience at this establishment better. However, if you dismiss my claims and glare at me for telling you something, do not expect me to ever come back again. Our dinner plates finally arrive another 20 minutes later with the appetizer at the same time. Our waitress seemed to realize we existed after we talked to the manager, but still never refilled our glasses until I asked her to over a hour later. Thankfully the appetizer was taken off our check because it had arrived at the end of the meal, but I still thought the whole thing was atrocious. I have no idea whether training for employees wasn't up to par or general lack of concern on the part of the managerial staff was to blame, but this has been the worst Cheesecake Factory I have ever been to and the worst customer service I have ever received. ----------------------------------------- Update: I received a gift card in the mail for 10$ at any Cheesecake Factory. I was contacted by the manager of the restaurant to come back and have a much better experience. It was very professional of him to take the matter seriously. However, I did not accept the invite when thinking back to that horrible service and cold food. I really hope that some changes were made to improve the establishment."
Tricia K.,"Miami, FL",165,478,683,3.0,7/2/2013,The Cheesecake Factory is great when you don't know where to go to eat.  Their menu is so extensive.  We love the small plates because we can try a wider variety of items.  The service was slow and not very good at this location.
John M.,"Atlanta, GA",2,177,115,4.0,10/17/2012,"I know The Cheesecake Factory is the ultimate chain restaurant experience that Yelp seems to abhor, but I really do like and enjoy it. Whether I want Italian, Chinese, Thai, Tex-Mex or just a good American hamburger, I can find it here.  I consider myself quite the Cheesecake Factory veteran so I will list out my favorite items over the years.  This is to help save some of you time in case you get overwhelmed by the novel of a menu.... Favorite Appetizers:  -- Avocado Eggrolls  -- Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes  -- Fried Mac and Cheese Favorite Entrees:  -- Farfalle Pasta with Roasted Garlic & Chicken  -- Cajun Jambalaya Pasta  -- Factory Burrito Grande (enough to feed 4 or 1 pregnant woman)  -- Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp Favorite Cheesecakes:  -- Vanilla Bean  -- Adam's Peanut Butter  -- Dulce de Leche Now loosen your belts and go enjoy!"
James R.,"Miami, FL",56,35,3,2.0,8/2/2014,Good food but don't go to the bathrooms. Wow nasty men and women bathroom. My wife went to take our kids to change them and it was nasty. I tried the men's room was equally nasty. Had to change my kids in the car.
Matthew P.,"Naples, FL",2,40,14,1.0,10/27/2014,"If you are looking for an overpopulated menu with no  innovation , subpar food, average service in the typical chain restaurant atmosphere you have found nirvana. Cheese cake is good. Fish tacos have petrified tortillas with overcooked under seasoned fish reminiscent of boxed frozen fish you would find at the grocery store. I have come here many times and always found it an adequate quick lunch. Recent menu changes and overall menu neglect have caused it to spiral downward. This restaurant is nothing more than a tourist trap at this point."
Dave K.,"Hinsdale, IL",0,18,,1.0,11/27/2014,"Unfortunately an awful experience yesterday. Hoping the management can use this feedback as a training experience.  My son ordered the kids hamburger sliders - these were cooked beyond recognition and tasted really bad.  We ordered the kids chicken strips for my 2 year old - these were hard and tasteless...couldn't even tell they were chicken actually. Both of their French fries were over cooked and hard.    My wife and both ordered the beet and goat cheese salad from the lite menu - the dressing was so incredibly tart it was difficult to force down to the point where I picked out the beets and had to leave all of the lettuce. Shockingly bad salad dressing.  The worst though was the ahi tuna appetizer I had from the lite menu. The tuna used had so much membrane in it, I literally couldn't stomach eating it. As I was looking for my server, the manager caught my eye. I showed him the quality of the fish and said I couldn't eat it. He took it away.  Come bill time, our server never asked how our meal was even though there were full plates for all four of us. I asked her if the manager took my tuna off of the bill - the server didn't know anything about it. I paid anyway and on the way out, we passed the manager. I asked him why he didn't tell the server about our conversation- he said he did, which I told him was a lie as the server obviously wasn't aware. I then asked if he usually would take something inedible off of a bill - he said he usually does but didn't.  So we walked out the door without even an apology. I rarely give bad reviews because I figure everyone can have an off day, but this was SO bad, I couldn't resist and like I wrote at the beginning, I hope management looks into this as the experience hurt the Cheesecake Factory brand."
Terry B.,"Evergreen Park, IL",0,5,1,4.0,1/5/2015,"Food is to die for. Be prepared to take a while to finalize your meal choice because the menu is enormous! Wait is a little long due to no reservations but worth it! My go-to meal is the chicken enchilada and R.W. Pink lemonade if you are looking to have a nice, refreshing drink!"
Jason N.,"Shelby Township, MI",0,1,,1.0,5/25/2015,"Well, the so-called ""manager"" Scott lived up to his name tonight. And by that I mean his attitude was as shitty as Scott Toilet Paper. We got there and there was water on our booth seats and on our table. We told our hostess and she handed us a napkin to clean it up ourselves. Unless you plan on giving me a paycheck at the end of the night it's not MY job to properly bust YOUR tables. Okay great, here comes our appetizer salad to put this little mishap behind us  and enjoy. As I go to put some pepper on it the top falls off into my salad, putting a mountain of pepper and the metal top into my salad. Our waitress was very nice about it (her and our entrées were the only positives tonight), and got her manager as I had asked. Here comes Scott. Hand on hip, other hand holding himself up on the back of the booth. Explained to him the problems we experienced and he sat there staring at us with the urgency of a sloth to respond and offer us the customer service a real manager should. No free salad, no percentage off the bill, just a pissy attitude and a fine showing of sub-par managerial skills. Scott, you can't provide people with delicious food and shit customer service and expect them to come back. We sure won't."
Camile A.,"Montclair, NJ",0,34,,5.0,12/25/2015,"Great choice, classic Cheesecake Factory.  Good service, Hugh portions, and tasty food."
