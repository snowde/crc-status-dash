Madison P.,"Bowling Green, KY",11,231,152,4.0,12/17/2017,"We had lunch here while I was waiting for my IPhone to be fixed.  So there are no pictures. My first time at this location.  The wait time was 15 minutes but it was only about 10 minutes. I ordered a Long Island Iced Tea.  I could smell the liquor.  It just didn't have a strong liquor taste.   I had the Cuban Sandwich.  It comes with Fries. I ate nearly half.  The sandwich is large and very tasty.  The Bread was delicious.  In fact I'd like all my sandwiches made with it.  My Husband had his favorite Rib Eye Steak, mashed potatoes and vegetables.  Of course my fork found his vegetables. Good time.  More Long Island Iced Teas for me."
William S.,"Yucaipa, CA",27,197,6,4.0,11/16/2017,"I like the Cheesecake Factory. I like the 400 page menu. I like the desserts. I like the Asian fusion type food there a lot. I like the appetizers. I like the ambiance. There's a lot to like about the place. In this specific instance, however, I have to take away a star for the service. I was traveling for business. Without getting into specifics, the nature of my trip meant I was all by myself for a few days which, by itself, isn't the greatest. So it's fairly annoying when waiters treat me like I'm some kind of a weirdo for having the temerity to dine alone."
Tanya P.,"Jeffersonville, IN",65,107,299,3.0,10/16/2017,"Standard Cheesecake factory offerings.  We traveled to Nashville for a friend's Bday and this was where she wanted to go.  There were 6 in our party and even though we'd called ahead for seating we still waited an additional 30 mins to be seated.  Once seated our waitress Rene did take good care of us, refilling drinks regularly and stopping by to talk with us.   I ordered from the small plates menu. The beet and goat cheese salad was amazing and really a good portion.  I also got the crab cake bites which I found to be disappointing.  I thought they'd be little crab cakes but they were balls that were mostly breading,  kinda like a hushpuppy with a little crabmeat.  I wouldn't recommend them.  I finished off with the lemon meringue cheesecake which was true to its name. Excellent choice,  I did share a couple of bites but I totally finished it off. My friends got Pizza, a cuban sandwich, some kind of pasta, and some thai dish...the Bday girl ordered Orange Chicken...however all of the other 5 of us were done eating before her dish even arrived at the table!!! And our waitress had come by a couple of times to say they were making or remaking her plate.  They gave her a free piece of cheesecake but I thought at that point the meal should be comp'd This particular chain is not a favorite of mine,  I find them to be overpriced for what they are. Plus I don't care for thier ""dine in the dark"" lighting setup...but not my bday,  not my choice."
Beth E.,"Tuscaloosa, AL",69,30,173,4.0,8/22/2017,"Vegan Review!  The Avocado Toast appetizer was so good!  My husband got the Veggie Burger without mayo and cheese and with sourdough bread instead of a bun. He like it, it had a really different texture to it. I got ""Evelyn's Favorite Pasta"" with the pasta tossed in olive oil instead of butter, and without Parmesan. The dish was very flavorful, and I especially liked the rigatoni noodles. No vegan cheesecake, of course, but still a bummer!"
Michelle R.,"Nashville, TN",1,93,43,3.0,9/24/2017,If I could give 3.5 stars I would. This Cheesecake Factory is pretty solid. Obviously there's nothing unique about the menu but there's definitely something for everyone!  We were seated relatively quickly and our server was great. We had the spinach and artichoke dip for an appetizer. Pretty standard issue fare.  I liked that we asked for just the brown bread and they happily obliged!  I love the strawberry lemonade and this one was made perfectly! For dinner I had the crusted chicken Romano which is my old standby. One order is enough for two meals!  My mom wanted a shrimp pasta dish but didn't want the cream sauce it came with but they happily swapped it out for a tomato sauce which was also nice.  Too full for cheesecake afterward!
Lydia D.,"Euless, TX",22,60,25,2.0,11/3/2017,"My inaugural visit to a Cheesecake Factory. After spending the day with my family at the Adventure Science Museum, we selected this a celebratory destination for dinner. It was evening and it was crowded, about a 30 minute wait. The restaurant a bit loud, a bit too dark and maybe because they were busy, we were served by multiple people which created confusion while ordering. Our drinks came out looking and tasting delicious and while expensive ($12), I was satisfied with the quality. We ordered the Crispy Crab Bites and the Ahi TarTare for appetizers which were exceptionally small and disappointing, literally 4 tortilla chips. Dinner included Fish Tacos, Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic and my choice, the Factory Combination Steak Diana and Shrimp Scampi. The garlic butter sauce was delicious but the shrimp breaded and fried.. why!? Not what the description said. My steak medallions were cooked to my requested medium but sitting in copious amounts of oil, the flavor was there but I moved them over the the shrimp side of the dry potato mountain. The presentation of meals was lackluster and messy with the pasta bowl reminiscent of ratatouille. For the price that I paid I am not happy. Many improvements can be made in the quality and value of the food, attention to the order and maybe an increase in staff to better handle peak times. Shout out to the bartender for the drinks, the sour cream cheesecake topping and the one server who brought out the kids food in a timely manner. I can think of several other restaurants of better quality and lower prices, it did not live up to the hype."
Leah H.,"Huntersville, NC",0,4,,1.0,12/26/2017,"Went to the bathroom at the beginning of my meal bathrooms were disgusting. Told the manager, manager had a waitress go into the bathroom to clean up. Went  to the bathroom at the end of my meal and the bathrooms were still disgusting."
Coolcow 1.,"Hendersonville, TN",2,3,,5.0,12/17/2017,"Its amazing, they have all sorts of diffrent food and cheese cake. Yelp made me type these extra word so ill just talk nonsense like frogs and cats with a goldfish eating a bag of goldfish so yeah"
Huy T.,"Nashville, TN",55,135,166,3.0,7/13/2017,"Portions are good, food taste ok, cheesecake is always tasty, but i have a sweet tooth.  This place is always busy, but they do open till 12 so if you have the late night munchies, it's not a bad place.   We live near by so we typically go on a weekday cause weekends are crazy - I'd rather go to other places in town if I'm going to wait 1-2 hours.  The crazy thing is when we go during the week and there are several open tables the service is worst than when they're busy.  Overall it's an ok place."
Ron B.,"Memphis, TN",130,190,311,3.0,9/5/2016,"This was my first Nashville visit to this Cheesecake Factory location. Like other Yelp reviewers, I have visited several other Cheesecake Factories in other cities. The wait was not bad(15-25 minutes). We had a very good and attentive server who kept our classes full and answered questions regarding the daily specials.  The negative for me was the food did  not come to our table hot, but Luke warm, like it was under a heating lamp. I order the Steak Diane and Chicken Madera combination. The cheesecake was very rich and flavorful which I am sure is their number#1 seller(over 30 flavors).  I got a chance to walk off my calories at the Green Hills Mall, but that is another review in if itself! Final grade:3 stars for the great service/location. The food needs to come out hotter and faster the next time. I hope this location will improve this."
Robert E.,"Murfreesboro, TN",215,153,,4.0,8/8/2017,"Just left Cheesecake Factory. Was by myself looking for a great meal at a favorite place. First of all I had to wait 10 min. for a host to come to the front desk. I told him a party of one and he said step aside someone will be with you shortly. I was the only person in line. 2-3 minutes later a lady came and called my name and headed toward the bar area. I told her that I preferred not to sit in the bar area it was nosey (which is understandable) and the tables offer no privacy. When I told her that she seemed disgusted by my request and immediately said-""we have no tables available in regular seating, it will be awhile."" I stood there for a second stunned because I was looking at 6-8 tables that were empty. I simply said thanks but I will go elsewhere. She just wadded up my ticket and walked away. Haha- didn't realize I was such a bother! Have had great service before- but this time Cheesecake Factory was a loser! I want to update a previous review. My wife and I gave Cheesecake Factory another try today and our results were much different than before. We were warmly welcomed and seated within two minutes of arriving. Our wait staff was quick and helpful. Of course the menu is vast with plenty of choices. My wife measures every restaurant by the quality of their ""fish and chips""- today she gave the Cheesecake Factory a ""A"" on their ""fish and chips."" I had the lunch size salmon and it was excellent. We had the side dish of Cole slaw and it was yummy. The restaurant is very clean and modern in decor. We had an enjoyable lunch today at the Cheesecake Factory!"
Lisa N.,"Murfreesboro, TN",54,43,74,4.0,8/16/2017,Usually if it's busy you won't get the best service but I know they try. Food is always good and hot when I order. Never a fail.
Laura H.,"Austin, TX",96,101,157,4.0,3/18/2017,Our server is great. Kept our drinks filled and also asked if everything was alright on more than one occasion. Food is consistent compared to all the other Cheesecake Factory's.
Alexis M.,"Nashville, TN",106,84,125,1.0,7/19/2017,"I came to eat at the bar for late lunch this week and happy hour. As I ate I had the unfortunate luck of seeing the bartender remove a bandage, clean it, and talk about the gaping puncture wound with his friends that were also at the bar. While enjoying a meal the last thing I want to hear about is your wound and how you got it or how you could draw a face on it because it is so large. Do better please."
Samuel E.,"Pleasant View, TN",16,120,1,1.0,5/27/2017,"God this place is terrible. Only appeals to the generic ""basic"" chick (e.g. Starbucks for breakfast, Panera for lunch) and whatever poor guy gets dragged along there....in this case me. Food tastes like microwaved dinners, service is mediocre at best.  I'd rather burn the money it cost for a dinner here and starve for the night as it'd be more entertaining and a better deal."
Beth G.,"Nashville, TN",467,369,645,1.0,7/18/2017,"All don't bother to ask for a booth even though there are several open. Hostess gave me excuse they just seated someone in that section and they don't want service to be poor. Really fing really?  A ton of tables open. FYI our server forgot half our drinks this visit sooooo even with lighter load not able to handle capacity. Sorry CCF really!?! Blonde haired M hostess needs to be better trained. Sheesh,  not worth it on a Tuesday afternoon at 1 pm. Not worth it anymore and poor service and food is not as fresh as it used to be. Did management change? 1 star at best last few visits."
Ron T.,"Smyrna, TN",44,176,24,4.0,6/16/2017,"""First visit. Oh Madeira!"" This was my first visit to Cheesecake Factory. All the females in my family had been a few times. Me and the son-in-law - first time. Why did we not go with them the other times? This is OBVIOUSLY  a chick place - obviously... We had eaten lunch a little early. We went to Cheekwood Mansion and walked the grounds for a couple of hours. My wife had a gift card for here and it was her birthday. This and the fact that we were a little (me, a lot) hungry - perfect storm. Oh! - and the mere mention of cheesecake to a woman - any other suggestions you make fall on deaf ears. You're talking and all they hear is blah, blah, blah...""How about Indian food?"" blah, blah, blah. ""How about sushi?"" blah, blah, blah. ""Steak might be good."" blah, blah, blah. ""Cheesecake Factory?"" ""Oh - The Cheesecake Factory will be fine dear - if you are sure that's what you want. I'm OK with anywhere!"" The women said the entrees here were huge. So I'm thinking - huge as in lady portion huge or huge as in manly man huge? I took their word for it and each couple ordered an entrée to share - Chicken Madeira . I did make it understood that if they were wrong we were stopping at the Burger King down the road after we left - and I wouldn't share. I was expecting a single chicken breast with the toppings described and a smidgen of pasta - we subbed angel hair pasta for the mashed potatoes. WOW! There were two chicken breast and more than enough pasta for two. There was a server holding each end of the plates while bringing our selection to the table and they were struggling at that - I may have exaggerated a little. The Madeira sauce blended so well with the angel hair pasta (or was it Madea - Oh Lordt).  I thought my wife loved me, but there was no to go box for her leftovers as she offered what she could not eat to our son-in-law. I'm going to probably need advice on a divorce lawyer...  After a short nap, we ordered four different cheesecake variations - can't remember what they were, but all were top notch. Not one of us could eat it all and we all received to-go boxes - HA! Mr. Son-in-Law! This is mine!!! In my opinion - the portions are way too large for one person. In our case we shared entrees and still took food home - well I didn't as previously mentioned - (let it go Ron, let it go). They DO NOT offer half portions which would be ideal."
Hannah S.,"Franklin, TN",61,18,,2.0,10/23/2017,"I came here just to pick up a piece of cheesecake to go and will never return to this location again. The 2 stars are simply for the cheesecake only. For just a piece of cheesecake, it took 20 minutes and I was the only one in line! The cashier was some rude kid that didn't want to take the time to put his cell phone down, stop chatting with the waitresses and just take a piece of cheesecake out of the fridge and put it in a box for me. None of the 3 waitresses took the time to stop chatting either as they did not care that anyone was waiting. When I asked him how much longer it would take, he very rudely replied ""hold on"" while rolling his eyes. Take the time to go to the Franklin, TN location instead. Will not be returning here!"
Nicki B.,"Winnipeg, Canada",10,1,9,5.0,1/9/2017,"Visited on a Sunday at 4:00, got in right away. All other times we tried, we gave up because it was too busy.  Service was good. I had the Asian lettuce wrap tacos, only 420 calories. Very tasty with two sauces to dip it in, and just enough to leave room for cheesecake.  My partner had stuffed chicken tortillas, a big plate, also very tasty. It came with a corn cake, very good, and black beans.  We shared a lemon raspberry cream cheesecake, nice lemon flavour with raspberry sauce. Yummy! Would definitely recommend!"
John T.,"Franklin, TN",88,162,304,1.0,8/12/2017,"First of all this was not the waitress's fault. I have never walked out of a restaurant after having ordered food, until today. Waitresses get a bad rap because management refuses to hire or schedule enough wait staff to service their clientele. My experience starting out poorly in the fact that I was seated and handed a menu and had to wait almost 10 minutes for the waitress to show up to take a drink order. I might have expected this if they have been super busy but four of the tables in my section were empty. When she arrived she took my drink order and our dinner order and left. I actually think she might have left altogether, because 15 minutes later I hadn't seen her even walk past our area of the restaurant. My dinner partner actually got up and filled our water glasses himself, even though two other waitresses walked by with water pictures and filled all of the tables around us. Finally after waiting for what seemed like an eternity and still not seeing my waitress, I flag down a manager and asking to cancel my order because I was leaving. I would like to say I will return to this establishment but after this experience I find that highly unlikely. Most servers in large chains like this have to share tips and that is suppose to encourage the staff to help cover each other's tables, because an happy customer is a tipping customer.  If they share tips here then management has failed to instill in it's employees a since of team work that will help this restaurant thrive. The sad thing about this whole event is that this restaurant has excellent food for a big chain. However, if many more customers have an experience like mine it won't matter how good the food is because people just won't come to taste it."
Lauren N.,"Franklin, KY",32,76,94,4.0,8/28/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory is good any city you're in. This one is great. My fiancé and I have been here a few times and we just went over the weekend for late anniversary/ celebration and it was so good! We ordered the egg role sampler which the salmon and avocado ones were our favorite. Then he ordered their best garlic pasta dish and he ordered me the tuna tatiki salad which was super yummy. Both of our dishes were incredibly tasty. My greens were great and the tuna was good too dipped in the sauce they give you. Exactly what I was craving! And his pasta dish O M G. SO GOOD!! It had peas, sundried tomatoes, mushrooms and bow tie pasta but the sauce was where it was at! Then we ordered our cheesecake of course and he ordered my usual raspberry white chocolate and then I ordered the salted Carmel and my goodness it was delicious! It was a little heavy but in a great decadent way. I wish I had some right now! And our waiter was super nice and funny and spoke proper English which is just something I always look for in people even though it's weird lol we asked him how he was doing and said doing well which most people say doing good which is technically improper English and totally makes my skin crawl so he was 5 star in my book for that alone and he performed excellent customer service! Don't remember this name sadly so I can't give him a shout out but every time we go here we always have wonderful wait staff. We love you guys!"
Jama'l O.,"Clarksville, TN",0,2,1,1.0,11/21/2017,"This place has ok food but the service is horrible. Our waitress snatched the menu, so we asked to be seated in another section the manager (Tamara) got an attitude because my friend said she didn't like the drink she had. We have no problem tipping but tonight was not a tip worthy night"
Tiffany M.,"White House, TN",0,17,7,5.0,9/7/2017,"It's so much better than it used to be!! They honestly have so many options now, that anyone can eat here. I ordered the teriyaki chicken, and it was the  ... really though it was really good. Can't wait to go back"
Natalie D.,"Brentwood, TN",5,22,14,5.0,9/12/2017,"I moved here part time from Southern California and Palm Beach, Florida where we had the best Cheesecake Factory on Worth Avenue.  The Cheesecake Factory here is newer, but it just as delicious and delightful as ever! How can I say more other than this Cheesecake Factory earns and gets a five star rating and is another Class Act Restaurant here in the Brentwood, TN area that I love!!!"
Nina I.,"Chicago, IL",667,491,62,4.0,6/15/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory is the Cheesecake Factory. I don't need to write an elaborate review since 8 out of 10 people have probably been at one of these around the country.  Only thing about this one is that at the time of my experience the service took very very very very long, and the food wasn't prepared well (too quickly to compensate for service and how busy the place must have been) so it hurt mine and my boyfriends stomachs :( I hate to say that about this place but it's true.  It's a chain so I doubt they even care about these reviews so this is just a heads up to fellow Yelpers who might be torn between this place and another while vacationing in Nashville, and my advice is to go with the other choice; especially if it's a small local eatery!"
Rae B.,"Nashville, TN",41,6,,1.0,9/12/2017,"I went to this CF with a group of friends (not my personal choice, but hey it'll be fine, I thought)   and had one of the rudest waiters I've had anywhere.  He first rolled his eyes while we dared to finish a sentence when he first strutted up, then later told us what a pain it would be to bring my check separately when I had to leave before the rest of the group.  He told us what items on the menu were ""disgusting"" when one of us asked about a few things, which ya know, is cool for us but probably not so cool to the restaurant.  If The Cheesecake Factory is hiring dudes like this to be the face of the place, who knows what's happening in the kitchen.  The waiter clearly hated his job and didn't care who knew it.  As for the food, I ordered a Cuban sandwich that tasted pretty good and then kept me up that night with a funky stomach.  I won't be back."
Tee V.,"Cordova, TN",13,63,151,5.0,8/22/2016,"Great restaurant! Beautiful decor, friendly staff and delicious food. What more could you ask for? :-)"
Tiffany M.,"Cape Girardeau, MO",46,10,22,5.0,2/26/2017,This place is always good .. food is good desert is good ... yummy all around service is very good . Waiters are always extremely polite and go above and beyond when waiting on you.  We also expected to have a long wait since it was noon on a Sunday but they said ten minutes and we were seated in five.
Steve W.,"Bowling Green, KY",3,36,185,4.0,7/15/2016,Sit down and ask yourself how you could ever go wrong with anything that has cheesecake in the title.  You just can't. I couldn't either. My Cuban Sandwich was amazing. They let the ham marinate in honey for 2 days I was told. The fried Mac and Cheese was just as yummy as you would imagine. The tirimisu cheesecake wasn't as rich as some of the other options while still being equally delicious. All in all I can say I was pretty please and I would eat here again.
Carter B.,"Nashville, TN",11,145,16,4.0,11/25/2016,"There's really not a lot new that I can say about The Cheesecake Factory. It had been a while since I was there and a early dinner on a Sunday afternoon seemed called for. My date and I drove around the Green Hills Mall lot for what seemed like forever till we decided to park in Dillard's garage. It was almost empty and is only a short walk across the bridge. The Factory was busy but we were soon seated and waited on quickly. I was going to order one of their pasta dishes, but I noticed that the lady next to me had an interesting looking salmon dish. It turned out to be a Thai salmon on rice with snow peas. I am glad I saw it as it was delicious. I could have eaten it all, but opted to bring home half to enjoy the next day. Unfortunately, a house guest ate it before I could so I should have just devoured the whole thing while I had the chance! My date had a salad - avocado and turkey, I think, but I never remember what my guest has unless they complain - and she didn't. No booze for us that day, so water made the nice meal quite reasonable. I like the decor, the ambiance, and the clean restrooms. I will always eat at The Cheesecake Factory from time to time."
Briana S.,"Clarksville, TN",0,7,4,4.0,7/17/2017,"Food was good, but was really expensive. We came on Sunday and figured there would be on long wait time, since church had just gotten out. We ended up waiting for a table only about 2 minutes. The only complaint I have is, that the hostess was a little rude. She didn't greet us, and when I went to give our name she acted like she didn't see us. Other than that service was good."
Taryn F.,"Nashville, TN",22,18,16,5.0,10/20/2016,"We had a great experience tonight with our server Talbert! Thank you so much Talbert for making my Mom's birthday special while she was visiting Nashville and singing her an amazing Birthday song! Thank you for taking care of us, and as always the food was fantastic!"
Jimmy S.,"Nashville, TN",111,243,65,2.0,5/28/2017,"Cheesecake factory is overrated, I think it is because of the variety of items on the menu-- it is expected. However, this particular restaurant you have to wait quite a while and especially if you come on the weekends you are going to have a hard time finding close parking. I got ice cream sundae here and it was okay but overpriced. The portions are pretty good though and the cheesecake also was all right."
Gabrielle F.,"Pleasant View, TN",0,1,,2.0,12/5/2017,"I tried the Cheesecake factory out for the first time last sunday. the food was absolutely amazing! i got the hibachi steak and it was beyond my expectations. but, when our food came, i didn't receive my tempura asparagus. i informed the waitress that i didn't get the rest of the food that came with my meal and she proceeded to argue with me saying that ""no, it doesn't come with it."" but she said i could have it added. i said okay, and she brought me a side of the tempura asparagus. a few minutes later, the gentleman that brought out my food brought out a side of the asparagus and in confusion asked if i had already gotten some and i said yes. i jokingly said to my mother-in-law ""i wonder if that was the one that came with my meal"" and sure enough it was. she brought out the menu after we were done with our food so we could look at the cheesecake options. to make sure i wasn't wrong, i double checked to see if it came with it. later we got the bill and i had been charged $7 for a side that i was already supposed to receive. when she came to take the bill, i told her once again that it came with it and she told me no, it did not and took off with the bill. we asked for a menu from another server so we could show her that i shouldn't have been charged. when she came to give us our bill after our dessert, we told her once more that the food came with asparagus and we shouldn't have been charged for it. she argued again and walked away with our check to check us out. we asked the people next to us to see their menu and when she brought us the bill back, we pointed it out and she said ""oh let me go talk to my manager."" well, after that, she took someone's order and then she took the table next to us with a party of 6 a ticket for the party of two on the other side. if they weren't honest about that, she would've been screwed. she came right up to us and said ""oh well the manager said since you've already paid there is nothing we can do about it."" so we asked to speak to the manager and she told us no because they were busy. SO NOT ONLY DID SHE LIE TO US ONCE, BUT TWICE!!!! SHE WAS ONLY SAVING HER BUTT. i will come back to eat again because of the phenomenal food, but never again will i be lied to and pay for food that came with my meal."
Tammy D.,"Drakesboro, KY",95,16,,5.0,11/6/2016,"I love this Cheesecake Factory! we have eaten there several times and have always had great food and service at this location.  I highly recommend the teriyaki chicken!  Large portions and perfectly prepared. My husband loves the Mac & cheese burger. As far as cheesecake,  I highly recommend the Ultimate Red Velvet Cake or the Lemon Raspberry.  Can't go wrong with either.  Parking here is a pain, but the food is well worth the effort!"
Stephen L.,"Franklin, TN",21,178,32,4.0,9/29/2016,"First time I've ever been to a Cheesecake Factory, and I was thoroughly pleased.  We were seated immediately by a polite greeter, and our server was at our table immediately.  We were checked on frequently, and he was clear and concise.  The atmosphere is awesome as the scenery is very elegant! The food tasted great (I got the four-cheese pasta, and my girlfriend got the Steak Diane).  We had plenty to take home with us, as we saved room to split a piece of Caramel Cheesecake WHICH WAS AMAZING.  We resisted each getting a piece, as it was definitely the BEST cheesecake I've ever eaten. Service and food were amazing, can't wait to come back!"
Samantha B.,"Collierville, TN",217,763,2516,5.0,12/24/2014,"Holy moly do we have one of these in Memphis? Because this place was AMAAAAZING!  I met up with my friend and her parents here. Her parents were eating with friends so she got a nearby booth for the three of us. I had never been here before but I had just eaten lunch with my mom and grandma so I wasn't that hungry. I ordered an entree and hubby ordered hot chocolate and a dessert and we split them both. I really loved the bread they brought to the table- wheat and white loaves. I definitely preferred the wheat, as did my friend. My waitress was named Becky and she was amazing.  I asked for the Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta with angel hair pasta instead of penne. They brought out penne and let me eat it while they corrected the mistake. I have to admit, penne was easier to eat. The meal itself is kind of soupy or wet so the angel hair pasta made it a messy meal. I will stick with penne next time! Becky let me keep both (yay!).  Onto the entree itself. The flavor of the Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta was amazing. However, most of the pieces of chicken in it were gristle and I didn't eat them. But the rest of it was great and it made great leftovers. Hubby and I were totally going to share the leftovers but ended up devouring it ourselves the next day instead.  The Dulce de Leche Hot Chocolate was so excellent my hubby only let me have a few sips before drinking it all himself. I wasn't as impressed with the Dulce de Leche Cheesecake but it was good as well.  When we came a second time I was excited to see a Thai-themed dinner dish, Bang-Bang Chicken and Shrimp so I got it (with brown rice!). I definitely prefer it with chicken and it's much better fresh.  I love the flavors. I liked it better fresh though as it just didn't taste as good as leftovers."
Quintin M.,"Bowling Green, KY",163,1,2,5.0,9/21/2017,"best ribeye steak i ever had in my life, No BS.. the server was nice and helpful, but they was supper  busy.. i will be back.. i wish BGKY had one, but Tn not that far... it was well worth the 2hr ride lol....."
Shima K.,"Franklin, TN",8,10,15,5.0,10/7/2016,The food portion is huge and the menu is encompassing. We can have bigger parties here and be loud. It is a fun atmosphere. Next to the movie theater so we can grab a bite before or after our movie!!
Gary N.,"Chattanooga, TN",3299,650,2151,3.0,10/27/2015,Outside of above average cheesecake I don't see the overall appeal. I have been to several and the wife wanted to eat here while in town. Reasonable wait of 30 minutes then go out table in center of seating area. Of course they are out of what I set my mind to. Order shrimp but after 5 minutes inform me they are out.  I ended up getting catfish dinner but breaking was thick and too hard. Just not what I wanted. Decided to cut my losses and save room for the cheesecake. Good choice! Never go wrong with the desert.
