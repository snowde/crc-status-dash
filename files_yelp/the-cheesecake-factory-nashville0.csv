Emily T.,"Philadelphia, PA",375,34,,3.0,7/20/2011,"Having grown up in Nashville, Cheesecake Factory is synonymous with excess in my head. Excessively large portions, excessively large prices, excessively lavish decor, excessively large stomachs needed. The food is nothing mind-blowing: just your standard American fare generally done well for a lot of money. Every time I eat here, I bring enough food back for a second and maybe even third meal.  You've probably seen the crowds milling about the mall exit and wondered why they were all waiting for lavish, expensive, chain-restaurant food. I, too have that question, but hey, it's damn good lavish, expensive, chain-restaurant food, and over time has become a bit of an experience unto itself. If you're here, you're probably either celebrating something or rather wealthy. Be prepared to wait, although I've never waited for more than half an hour.  Anything that comes with their mashed potatoes is a safe bet, as they're everything mashed should be--large, creamy, delicious, will land heavily in your stomach and fill you up. The fried mac and cheese appetizer is delicious. Fish tacos are my favorite order, I've had good experiences with their chicken chipotle pasta, and any one of their sandwiches is a safe choice--good and economical, as they're on the cheaper end of the massive, massive menu, and they come with a lot of fries.  Order what you want to eat, be prepared to take food home, and save room for the cheesecake--it's worth it."
Hannah Y.,"Luray, VA",0,27,7,4.0,8/1/2014,"Walked in at 5pm on a Friday night with no wait which was amazing. Food was as always Cheesecake Factory awesome. For dessert I had the Oreo cheesecake which was good but RICH. If you're a true plain ol cheesecake lover like myself I would recommend going for something that has a little more cheesecake and a little less chocolate, however it was still good. My only real ""complaint"" was being seated at such a small table between other small tables. It made date night a little hard since the restaurant was a little noisy and we felt like we couldn't really have any couple-convos without the table next to us hearing every word and vice versa. Elliot was our waiter and he was THE BEST. Like seriously this guy should get a raise. He was extremely professional, well mannered, attentive and let his personality shine through which is what you always want in a good waiter. He honestly may have been the best waiter my boyfriend and I have ever had on a date night. 4 stars for food, 3 stars for the table and 5 stars for Elliot!"
Princess X.,"Franklin, TN",3,10,,5.0,12/4/2013,"Such a delightful and festive atmosphere any time of year.  Food is always good and fresh.  Moderate prices for excellent food.  Of course the cheesecake is to die for, especially the Red vellvet with white chocolate curls.  Yumo!  Great service and hats off to Rodney, the current manager for correcting a minor error.  He's the best!  Thank you Rodney!"
Nathan K.,"Nashville, TN",62,159,,3.0,6/28/2010,"Strengths: 1) Location 2) Decor/ambiance 3) Menu choice 4) Our waitress was super friendly and helpful Optional: during the right times and seasons the outside eating can be nice. Weaknesses: 1) High sugar content (even their diet friendly options seem to be loaded with calories).  Not even close to healthy....  (On the plus side--a pretty good way to get some junk in the trunk...and elsewhere.....) 2) A tad overpriced food and cheesecake 3) I got something Asian (Curry Chicken) which feels like an overstretch for Cheesecake Factory.  This dish lacked soul, authenticity, and taste.  Perhaps, they should call it ""Mall of America or White Bread Chicken Curry"" and thus dismiss all contrived attempts at Asianness in this dish.   I'm not even particularly savvy with curry chicken, but this fell short from even my novice taste.  It sad that this place may have (partially) done in the Green Hills Grille--which was a much, much better experience. (Overall Review: 3.45)"
James R.,"Old Hickory, TN",41,39,28,3.0,2/24/2010,"Ok, work with me on this.  Ever seen the musical ""Cats""?  You know Grizabella, the Glamour Cat?  The once beautiful, now washed up cat that is slightly pitful in her attempts to recapture her former glory?  Yeah, exactly... kinda like Paula Abdul. Don't hate.  Paula Abdul was my first crush.  I had her poster on my wall as a kid.  The one with her in the leopard print.  Uh huh.  You know the one. Well, that's Straight Up the Cheesecake Factory.  I'm not trying to be Cold Hearted about it, but sometimes Opposites Attract, and sometimes you just have to Rush, Rush out of there. Oh God.  Make it stop. Sorry.  Now that I'm properly sedated, let me explain what I mean.  About 10 years or so ago, the Cheesecake Factory used to be the bomb.  About the same time saying something was ""the bomb"" was actually relevant. Funky decor.  Eclectic food.  A menu thick enough it would have made Tolstoy proud.  And cheesecake.  Oh, the cheesecake.  Like a culinary colors of Benetton ad, this place was the freaking UN of cheesecake. And 10 years later, that's exactly what it still is.  The Cheesecake factory hasn't changed; but the world around it has.  The food's still decent.  The cheesecake selection still unfathomable.  And the menu still has it's own zip code. But it's stuck in a bit of a time warp.  Like the lady you see at Walmart that's darn proud she can still wear her Jordache jeans, the old CF is pretty determined to keep the status quo. And why not?  It's still almost a two hour wait during busy times.  It's still kinda fun to enjoy the whole dated experience.  And those avocado eggrolls and white chocolate raspberry cheesecake still make me happy for each individual tastebud. And I still have a crush on Paula Abdul."
Tim G.,"Franklin, TN",419,357,26,2.0,5/9/2012,"First time at this location.  Service poor. Food nothing special.  Cheesecake...higher prices, smaller sizes."
Michael H.,"Nashville, TN",27,69,11,5.0,5/6/2013,"This is one of my favorite places to eat in Nashville.  The food is always great and they give you plenty of it.  The Spicy Cashew Chicken and Cajun Chicken ""Littles"" are my favorite.  The servings are very big so it is pretty easy to share when you eat at the Cheesecake Factory.  For dessert I love the Godiva chocolate cheesecake and the Strawberry Shortcake.  The only negative is there is always a wait at this location and it is hard to find a parking spot since it is attached to a mall."
Bob D.,"Valencia, CA",6,18,,2.0,3/3/2012,"I usually avoid The Green Hills Mall like the plague, but I was hungry and had no food at my house.  More importantly, I had a gift certificate to this place and I decided it was time to give it a shot.   I admit I was a bit irritated off the bat.  I called in my order and for some reason the first person who answered the phone couldn't take my order--even though I called the number listed for take out.  I was put on hold for about 5 minutes--foreshadowing the sh""t show I was about to get myself into.  They asked me if I wanted curbside or if I wanted to pick my food up inside.  I'm not lazy, so I told the girl I'd come in.  HUGE MISTAKE. Anyways they tell me my order will be ready in about 20 minutes.  I live like a mile from the mall and it's 730 PM so I figure, ""no problem.""  After searching for a parking spot for nearly 15 minutes, I walk into the joint.  I have never been here before so I'm looking for some sort of sign as to where I can pick up my food.  None.  So I get in line to speak to the hostess.  She tells me I can pick up my food at the bakery.  I get over by the bakery and there are people sitting on the ground waiting for a table at this joint.  Ridiculous.  Another reviewer mentioned feeling agoraphobic.  I could not agree more.  From the moment I walked in, I could not wait to get out of this place.  People everywhere.  How about an ""excuse me, sir"" instead of elbowing and pushing your way through?  I get it though you're probably pissed you've been waiting 2 hours to get a table for some food a step above Applebees in quality.   So I proceed to wait in a line for the bakery to get my takeout meal.  Mind you the reason I ordered takeout was to avoid lines and people for that matter.  How ironic I'm being smothered by people and I've been in 3 lines (if you consider waiting for a parking spot in the lot a line).  I finally get to the register and the employee is pleasant.  The hostess was pleasant too, but I'm pretty cute and we all know cute people get treated better than ugly ones.  So I am finally able to pick up my food, make the 2 block trek back to my car and get home to a barely warm meal I heated up in the Microwave.   Yes, there are certain things that I had control over in this experience.  I should have done the curbside pickup and I could avoided most of the irritation.  However, it still doesn't change the fact that the food was average, the wait mentionable and the atmosphere uncomfortable to say the least."
Mandy C.,"Fort Myers, FL",380,298,872,3.0,3/11/2010,"As far as the food goes, as I expected, it is just like all the other Cheesecake Factory's.  I am sure most people on this site know what to expect from the book, I mean menu of entrees.   If not, then you are in for an hour of contemplating as you start from page one and end on page 30 undecided from all the options in front of you.  As a frequent diner of Cheesecake Factory's in the country I stick to my regular now: Chicken lettuce wraps and the grilled salmon with asparagus.  But there are many great tasting items.  And make sure to save 1,000 of your calories for the day for the dessert if you have never had a piece of the famous cheesecake! As far as this location I must say it is a big plus.  It is in a fabulous, high-end mall in a very nice neighborhood outside of downtown Nashville.  There is a nice movie theater right there so it makes for a great date night of dinner and a movie!  Staff has been friendly and bar very speedy...give this location a try!"
Natalie T.,"Alamo, TN",65,6,,4.0,5/22/2013,We decided to go to the cheese cake factory for my best friends birthday so we could have some yummy cheese cake! We went during happy hour so we enjoyed the buffalo blasts which are always amazing and since it was happy hr we got a full order for only $5 WOW!  For our main course we both had fish and chips which were average and typical for a large chain restaurant especially one that has such a massive menu.  The service was good and our food was out extremely fast (I'm guessing because everything we ordered was premade and just needed to be fried up for us.) The only thing that took a while was the cheese cake! It seems every time I go here it takes a good 10-20 min to get our cheesecake after we order it! It was ok though since we were already stuffed.  And the cheese cake was amazing as always! She had the red velvet which never disappoints and I had the tiramisu that I really enjoyed!  Will def be back for the cheesecake but next time will prob just order some lettuce wraps or the buffalo blast as my meal because it seems the entrees usually leave me wishing I hadn't spent the money.
Matt L.,"Hermitage, TN",24,484,70,3.0,8/12/2010,"Let there be no doubt, the cheesecake is AWESOME!   I got a burger, and the meat was first class.  When you can get service, it's very friendly and proactive. But their other food spotty and not always outstanding, their food differs somewhat from their menu, their staff disappears at times, and sometimes the little things don't come up to snuff. When we got the bread, it was not even warm.  I thought you're supposed to get warm bread at a place like this.  I was thirsty, so I went through my tea quickly, and since the staff disappeared for long stretches of time, it was empty for long stretches before and during the meal.  My burger had not only that weird special sauce, but also mayo on the other side of the patty.  I'll cop to probably missing the special sauce on the menu, but not the mayo.  They're so unnecessary, because it was such tasty meat. But the cheesecake was awesome.  This is a place where you're going to pay a pretty penny, and it is not up to the pricing.  We went because we had a gift card, and the price plus the fact that some important pieces were missing."
Sean F.,"Urbana, IL",225,73,76,3.0,8/29/2012,"I like Cheesecake factory. At my recent visit, I got seated quickly, but I waited for a server to take my order for 20 minutes. I was dining solo, and I am not sure why I had to watch the server walk past me to get to the other tables. I like the food at the Cheesecake Factory, but really don't like that you can't get a smaller portion at dinner time. The price was way on the high end, too, which doesn't help in this tight economy. My cheesecake was good, as was my meal, but I will think twice before going in the evening again."
Muku K.,"Nashville, TN",28,100,3,2.0,7/17/2010,"OK, I have been at The Cheesecake Factory in Green Hills about three times now not because I wanted but because our friends somehow always decide we should be going there. I always thought this must be a decent place since many of my friends go there and wait for so long but I realize that people go there not because it is good but because there is no better restaurant in the green hills area around the mall. The portions are huge and you are almost guaranteed to ask for a box to take leftovers home. But in my opinion the quantity comes at the expense of the quality, as is usually the case. It is ordinary food, but hey what do you expect from a place as large as the cheesecake factory, it would be stupid to expect good food in such a large chain restaurant.  The only reason I am giving this place two stars is because it is in a convenient location and the parking is easy and some of the cheesecakes are good. The food on the other hand gets no stars from me."
D H.,"Elk Grove, CA",9,37,3,3.0,8/6/2012,"I usually love Cheesecake Factory but this one was just alright, my silverware was dirty, that always annoys me but the food was good. The chicken samosas were a little salty but good and the navajo sandwich was great. Also my waiter did a very good job."
Missy M.,"Nashville, TN",0,14,,1.0,8/19/2011,"Someone gave me a $50 gift card and so I went twice to try to eat there and the line was too long. So the next time I went to the counter and found out my card would buy me 1 cheesecake. Really high but I was expecting greatness.  I ordered a classic strawberry cheesecake and after waiting 45 minutes for it I took it home to share at a family party.  THE STRAWBERRIES WERE RANCID!!!!!!! Underneath the beautiful red gloss were GRAY strawberries. I was so sad, we ended up scraping off the topping and trying the cheesecake but it wasn't anything special.  I think the frozen kind from Costco is about the same. Maybe their food is better."
R R.,"Nashville, TN",0,89,2,2.0,5/20/2014,"I know you don't go to the Cheesecake Factory to eat healthy, but when most of the menu is over 1000 calories that should be illegal! Between the calories and the wait times (which can easily stretch over an hour just to be seated), and the eh, average cheesecake, I just don't get it!"
Zoraida K.,"Nashville, TN",51,69,423,2.0,2/21/2012,"Met a friend there to""over indulge"" on Fat Tuesday..my wild mushroom hamburger was much more a sloppy cheese burger than wild mushroom. I could barely taste the mushrooms as I hurriedly ate my burger before the cheese slipped right out off the bun! The Kahlua cocoa coffee cheesecake made up for the burger but then I looked down & saw a small roach crawl from our table to another on the floor! Yuck!"
Da Deacon H.,"Nashville, TN",295,272,830,5.0,2/22/2012,"Love the location cause its in the mall but can be reach from the outside as well. Green Hills area in general is a pretty nice place itself so I'm not surprised by how good our experience was there! What I like the most is the breakfast there,..the  Factory Create an Omelet which is any Four of the Following: Bacon, Ham, Sausage, Cheddar, Jack, Swiss, Fontina, Goat Cheese, Avocado, Roasted Peppers, Fresh Mushrooms, Asparagus, Spinach, Bell Peppers, Fresh Tomato, Red or Green Onions. Or the California Omelette Avocado, Mushrooms, Green Onion, Tomato, Garlic and Shallots, Sour Cream, Jack Cheddar and Swiss Cheese these things are MASSIVE and really good! Staff is always friendly even when my fiance sends her food back for whatever reason,..they are still kind and the manager comes out to make sure all is well. Will be back over and over again!"
James A.,"Portland, OR",6,58,48,4.0,3/13/2012,Never been let down.  Always a solid choice for a good meal and great dessert.  We just don't go there more because it can be pricey depending on what you order.
Sam G.,"Nashville, TN",70,249,14,3.0,1/25/2012,"Standard Cheesecake Factory, which means good food and huge portions.  I had the lunch Cobb Salad, and it was HUGE.  The ingredients weren't overly fresh or delicious, but it was a decent salad.  The stuffed mushrooms were mighty fine, though!"
