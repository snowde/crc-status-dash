Annabelle A.,"Nashville, TN",17,49,66,4.0,3/30/2014,"After visiting several times, overall they're pretty good. Pros:  Large menu with lots of variety.  Very large portions (seriously, each entree serves 2), consistent food that's always pretty good, lots of yummy cheesecake, free bread, separate cheesecake counter so you can buy to go. Cons: Large menu-seriously there are way too many things on it! If you have over 200 menu items, it's too much.  Almost always busy, so long waits.  The dim lighting goes a little far (I know you're trying to create the atmosphere, but you can barely read the tiny print on the menus-and I don't have bad vision at all!)  Also the spinach dip was basically just spinach & artichokes, not nearly cheesy or flavorful enough. So far I've had the Godiva Chocolate, apple strudel, chocolate mousse, dolce de leche, original, and white chocolate macadamia cheesecakes.  The Godiva & dulce de leche were my favorites."
Michael Y.,"Columbia, SC",37,77,169,5.0,1/17/2015,"Excellent food!  I had about a 30 minute wait to get a table, but the service was great and the food was better. Clean environment, friendly service, clean restrooms. The non booth tables are cramped for space and slightly loud but still a great atmosphere. Definitely coming back here soon."
Corey W.,"Honolulu, HI",71,225,41,3.0,9/5/2014,"The cheese cake factory, one of those places that has something for everyone. This is due to the fact that their menu is the length of a short novel. Luckily for you armed with a 6th grade reading level and about 20 minutes of your time you can read through the whole thing. The fact that it is so big is annoying. However the food is pretty good. Not really great but solid and very consistent, as is their service. This location seems to hold up their company standard well."
Larry S.,"Hendersonville, TN",139,428,121,3.0,12/16/2014,"I really, really don't like having to go to the Green Hills mall, but since we were there, we decided to grab some lunch at The Cheesecake Factory.  The place was packed with holiday shoppers, but we were still seated, as promised, within 15 minutes.  I ordered the grilled chicken tostada salad, and when the waiter asked if I wanted the full portion, I replied ""of course.""  I shan't make that mistake again. The salad was amazing, but I have never before ordered a salad that I couldn't finish.  They started with a massive platter and loaded it to overflowing.  My wife really enjoyed her shrimp tacos, but she also had more food than she could finish.  So neither one of us had room for the cheesecake. The menu is a book.  Seriously.  They have so many items that it was difficult to figure out what we wanted.  Bookmarks would have been helpful.   We were seated right beside a server station, and we spent the entire meal with waiters and waitresses literally standing over us.  At one point we had two people standing beside us and another standing right behind me, and I felt like I was back in a submarine mess deck. This was my first experience dining at the Cheesecake Factory.  If we do go back to Green Hills, I'm more likely to pick up some cheesecake to take home than dining there again."
Jason W.,"Mt Vernon, IL",4,6,2,5.0,1/21/2016,It's a chain you know what you are getting. Great service great food. Steak Diane or Bang Bang anything. Enjoy!
Mary V.,"Nashville, TN",11,29,165,4.0,7/25/2014,"Large menu, good food, grab your sweater. The menu here is literally a book.  Since I've been quite a few times, I now simply stick to the Skinnylicious Menu which aim at smaller portions and fewer calories.  They also have a lunch menu on page 8 of their novel/menu.  My favorite things from the Skinny Menu are Beets with Goat Cheese Salad, Chicken Samosas, Ahi Tartare, Shrimp Summer Rolls.  I used to ALWAYS order their Miso Salmon but I had no idea it had so many calories!  I'm trying to get my summer beach body here, come on. Grab your sweater if you tend to get chilly easily because it is damn cold in here.  Always. If you have budgeted for it, try a cheesecake or two.  They are quite pricey for a slice but man are they good - all of them.  Every single one I have tried have been delicious.  My mouth is watering thinking about it right now.  When's lunch? Location - Great.  Smack-dab in the middle of Green Hills Mall.  Burn off some cheesecake calories while shopping. Parking - Sucks.   Service - Good. Food - Great. Pricing - Fair/Good. I want some cheesecake."
Kelly G.,"Fort Worth, TX",34,47,6,4.0,7/13/2016,"We visited on a Tuesday night.  We had to wait about 10 mins for a table.  Not bad at all for a Cheesecake Factory.  Our waitress, Haley B., promptly greeted us.  She was super friendly.  We ordered the parmesean-garlic cheese bread and one order of fettuccini alfredo to share.  The one and only complaint I had was the lady who brought out the cheese bread.  She was an older woman and came over, pushed everthing out of the way and slammed the bread in the middle of the table.  She never said a word or acknowledged us.  She was very rude.  But, the bread was the absolute best thing I've ever had at the Cheesecake Factory.  It was fantastic.  The parmesan salsa that comes with it is delicious.  The fettuccini was huge and plenty of food for the two of us.  We decided to get a slice of cheesecake to go for later.  I asked the waitress if we could get some plastic forks since we were staying in a hotel.  She was happy to bring them and then offered us to go cups since we were in a hotel.  She was extremely nice and provided us excellent service!  I would highly recommend this place for dinner.  The only thing keeping me from giving 5 stars is the lady who brought out the bread!"
Ryan W.,"Fayetteville, NC",21,49,10,4.0,1/16/2016,"Quite the spot to be for lunch!  There was a line outside before it opened.  As with any Cheesecake Factory, the food was great!  I was very thankful for the quick service and attentiveness if our wait staff.  Dining with two young children is always a different experience, and their team was mire than accommodating for us!"
Heather R.,"Nashville, TN",79,5,1,1.0,10/10/2015,"I came to this location because it was closer to get a to-go order before work tonight. To start off the first time I called I waited on the phone for over 5 minutes before I decided to hang up and call again. Upon calling again I was on the phone for almost another 5 minutes before someone responded. Granted the lady over the phone was nice and helpful. When I arrived I informed the lady at the front desk that I had a to-go order. And she was very rude as she pointed to the counter on my right with her face scrunched up, saying its over there. When I approached the desk I told the lady my order she printed my ticket and instead of handing me a pen to sign the receipt she made me reach over someone else's bag to grab a pen. Let's just say I won't be visiting this location again since people don't believe in friendly customer service."
Thao N.,"Antioch, TN",0,2,,1.0,7/21/2015,Bad service and the food too salty. Me and my husband went there for his birthday. I was so sorry for him. Bad birthday for him ever. I wasn't mean to give that bad tip for the waitress. Guess what happened me and my husband ordered 2 steak. The steak too salty then he told the waitress and she said let she bring it to the back and tell the chef wash all the sauce off and put the sauce separate and the manager gave us more bread without butter. How can we eat that?. But what my husband received only that steak washes and over cook without any sauce. Then the dinner ended up pretty bad. When we walked out. The waitress didn't look at us and said any thanks. We ended up with the total $80 with $1.50 tip. We always give the good tip like 30% or more. By the way never go back there again.
Sheena T.,"Nashville, TN",373,608,1468,2.0,7/8/2013,"I only came here recently because of a gift card and I am reminded why I avoid this particular Cheesecake Factory. 95 percent of the time there is a wait and usually a long one at that.  I don't get it. It's a chain restaurant with OK food and I cannot understand why people wait so long to eat here. Especially when there are many other dining options nearby. Also, the pagers DO NOT extend past a small distance of the restaurant, so you can't even shop around while enduring a 45 minute plus wait.  The food book (yes, it is huge) has just about anything you can want and it's standard fare. I was pleased that they offer health conscious options, but in reality there's just nothing to be blown away by. Service is OK but there's really not any motivation to eat here for me at all."
Lindsey J.,"Orange Beach, AL",16,6,3,4.0,2/12/2016,"I was skeptical at first about the Cheesecake Factory because I've heard negative things. However, I tried it out today and loved it. I highly recommend the Dynamite Shrimp and cheesecake of course."
Dilshad D.,"Franklin, TN",38,1,2,4.0,5/19/2014,"New to the happy hour at Cheesecake Factory. Seems pretty good so far. Love the interior design, especially the high ceiling. May,19,2014"
Dixon W.,"Nashville, TN",0,2,11,4.0,2/9/2015,Great food great service surprise we don't have to wait. We split a chicken piccata and it was filling for both of us.
Lee J.,"Lompoc, CA",12,49,38,4.0,3/22/2014,"How on earth does the Cheesecake Factory get rated so low? I'm a huge fan of the Cheesecake Factory and I admit I'm biased. I can only imagine that Nashville locals aren't appreciative of the super delicious dishes that CK Factory is legendary for.  I'm speculating here; Southern pallets prefer a down home cooked styled meal. Either that or the locals aren't fan of the 20 plus minutes of waiting required before seating. Maybe it's the crowd that CKF draws. I mean people pack the booths and tables often. It can get quite a busy. Call ahead if you can to avoid the major buzz kill when you arrive. If you're in a party you may want someone to scout ahead, get there early and reserve a a table or two.  If this is your first time to the CKF you may suffer sticker shock. Word to the wise, prepare for a bill of at least $60 for a couple not including drinks. If you're comfortable with that price tag then you're in for a great meal.  Newbies should be wisely advised to save room for dessert. Hard to do cause CKF always off generous portions. The entrée are spectacular but the deserts are what makes you a believer.  The service is usually fast. However, I'm not to certain at this location. I do remember that the servers were mostly nice and courteous. With a good choice of timing and preparation you and your dining party are in for a wonderful dining experience."
Ann B.,"Los Angeles, CA",55,55,68,2.0,4/13/2014,"Visited here last Wednesday.  The service was good and we were party of 11.  Ten minute wait to be seated was super. The restaurant itself is beautiful.  The food entree I ordered was not good at all. I ordered the cheese pasta (not sure the technical name for it from the menu). The taste was really bad. More like just all marinara and no cheese, except for the blob of ricotta in the middle. I am not one to complain in restaurants, so I ate what few bites I could put down and that was it.   The pro: the cheesecake I ordered was out of this world!! Dulce (some type of caramel). I have been dreaming about it since I ate it! Its delicious!   Regarding staff dress code: they look dirty! At least their clothes and shoes. And I'm not talking about hygiene. Look at those workers shoes! What should be white is nasty and dirty! Makes me wonder how clean the kitchen is, because I know that is where most of their traffic is too. How about this...wouldn't it be better (I know it would look better) for the hostesses (who don't get dirty) to wear white? And the servers to wear black? I think the managers or whoever makes the dress code should consider a serious revision. Next time you visit take a look at their shoes. That alone will make one not want to eat anything that comes out of that kitchen."
Cynthia B.,"Nashville, TN",0,2,1,2.0,3/1/2015,"Good food,horrible dining experience Disappointed  I've been to this location several times and was always satisfied with every aspect of the dining experience , that is up until recently. My husband and I decided to dine here one evening and we brought along our kids 6 and 12. The wait was normal on your typical weekend so that was not an issue. Where my issue lies is wear and how we were seated. We were seated all the way in the back close to the kitchen, as well as other African American's who were dining, along side Caucasian families who you could tell was not from that demographic area or (zip code) if you catch my drift. All of the servers for us in the ""back"" we're African American as well. While taking my youngest to rest room she noticed the front of the restaurant was seated with nothing but Caucasian people. It was bad enough when my husband and I caught on to what was going on, but what made it even worse was when both of my children noticed what was going on as well. I hated that there experience was less than acceptable,and I was very disappointed that they had to experience being discriminated in that way. I hope anyone in management reads this and seriously makes some changes. I will not go back to this location unless changes are made."
Mark C.,"Santa Ana, CA",0,63,,1.0,6/22/2015,Awful and I mean awful experience! Even the manager could not fix or resolve multiple attempts to get our lunch order correct. Worst experience ever! Cheesecake Restoration more the name. Do not go!  Run! run! Run!
Parker E.,"Manchester, TN",1,64,,3.0,6/7/2016,"Took my sweet wife there for anniversary dinner. Service was excellent. I had a Caesar salad and fish tacos.  Salad was fine, but not a good value at $9.95.  The fish taco dinner had a generous serving (four tacos, rice, and black beans). The fish was not warm and overall, the tacos were not impressive.  Beans and rice were better than the tacos.  May return, but will not repeat this menu selection."
Ryan P.,"Kennesaw, GA",45,308,40,2.0,7/30/2014,"Sort of disappointing for a date night. Wife and I were seated at a table that barely allowed room for us before we had our food. we choose to go with tons of appetizers instead of mains, so that we could try all the different things. Cuban rolls sounded great till the came out fried like an egg roll. In fact almost everything seemed to be fried. on top of that, the small table didn't give us a lot of room to eat so it became very congested. when we finally left, we actually weren't interested in taking any of our left overs home so that shows how unsavory they were. Maybe next time we will order something from the entrée menu and it will be better."
