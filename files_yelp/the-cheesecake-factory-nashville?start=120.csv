Matthew K.,"Cookeville, TN",45,127,150,4.0,5/22/2013,"First off the waitresses look nothing like Penny from the Big Bang Theory, in fact the place shares almost nothing but its name with the restaurant in BBT, also in case your wondering it looks nothing like a factory either.  When you enter you feel like your in Aladdins Palace, if its dinner time ask for a table that doesn't face the large window above the bar, as you will be blinded by the light, also there are a row of tables that face mirrors, this makes dinner awkward as the people behind you will think you are starring at them the whole time.  The drink specials at happy hour were priced well, were strong enough, but still had enough favor. I got a Long Island ice tea and a Bloody Mary, both I would get again.  As for the food it's delightful but pricy, the Cajan Pasta was good but was more tomato based, then Alfredo for my liking. The server forgot to bring us bread, but we were so full, it wasn't needed.  Finally their namesake famous cheesecake was good, sweet and delightful. I would probably go back just for that instead of dinner."
Chris W.,"Lebanon, TN",0,1,,3.0,1/1/2016,"The food was good but the wait and slow service made lunch an all afternoon endeavor.  We arrived at 12:30 and finally made it out the door at 3:00.  The wait to be seated wasn't too bad, about 45 minutes, but every other aspect of service seemed to move at a snails pace.  The food was good but not good enough to go back for if that time frame is the norm for lunch."
Beth F.,"Murfreesboro, TN",28,56,57,3.0,8/9/2014,"I've been to a lot of Cheesecake Factory's, and this one is not exceptional.   The food always comes out, and it's pretty good, but I wouldn't go out of my way to stop in at this particular location. The service tends to be a bit slow as well."
Melissa B.,"Louisville, KY",469,1137,11890,3.0,9/2/2012,"Tony and I ate the Cheesecake Factory at Green Hills Mall last holiday season mainly because of the show BIG BANG THEORY..we enjoyed it.  The decor was great and lovely, big and airy and the food was not bad..nothing I would have to rush back for....Tony had a Philly Cheesesteak with fries..(fries were good) and I had soup and salad..which was very good with a house dressing and bread and I LOVED THE BREAD ....would go again, but too expensive for not getting the WOW factor.."
Benjamin R.,"Franklin, TN",67,17,10,5.0,4/27/2014,The Cheesecake Factory provided a wonderful dining experience on many occassions! Their menu is literally a book! You could eat there every night for a year and still not have tried everything on their menu. I love the cheesecakes (huge variety)!
Tammy T.,"Nashville, TN",225,76,37,4.0,1/29/2015,"Cheesecake factory's happy hour definitely brings out the fat girl in me. I mean who can resist all the cheap tempting appetizers. am i right? Selections from the happy hour menu are only served at the bar, so my friends and I had to squeeze in a crap ton of plates on the tiny tables :( But the complimentary bread totally makes up for it !!!!! the bread is so good. I asked for 243902 refills, no shame."
Ivonne M.,"Murfreesboro, TN",2,5,1,5.0,12/18/2015,"We stopped for lunch after a little holiday shopping! We had pasta, strawberry lemonades, and lettuce wraps. Yum yum yum! The service was great, the food was perfect, and now our tummies are full."
Allison B.,"Nashville, TN",4,52,5,5.0,4/30/2015,"For starters, valet is offered right outside the entrance. Beautiful, massive interior and some outside seating available. Nice bar area. Bakery near the entrance. Clean restrooms. Some days service is slower than others. They can get very busy - on the bright side it's connected to the mall for while you await your table. The menu is overwhelmingly extensive. Pre-dinner rolls are delicious. I always get the four-cheese pasta, and I love it. They also have lunch portions. This is one of my favorite places."
Joe M.,"Walled Lake, MI",227,1077,232,4.0,4/3/2014,"I am a major fan of this place. I have a gluten allergy and this is an awesome place to eat if you need gluten free food. The staff was slow, but the food was worth the wait. We really did wait a long time for our food and the waitress just didn't come back that much. Again the food made up for it. I will be back."
Elle S.,"Memphis, TN",109,343,59,4.0,1/1/2014,I took a star away because the wait is ridiculous which can make service slow as well. Other than that it always has the same consistency with food anywhere in the country. And what kind of bUtter do they use? It tastes amazing. I love the calamari. I got grilled cheese sandwich w tomatoes and it was sooo good! To be fair every single Cheesecake Factory I've been to there's always been a wait.
Brian D.,"Nashville, TN",69,27,29,3.0,11/21/2013,"The Cheesecake Factory. The name alone makes me want to love this place. If they only sold cheesecake and nothing else, I'd give this place 5 stars.  When you walk in you will immediately be amazed by the size of the restaurant, regardless of how gaudy the decor appears, all of which is quite analogous to the menu itself.  The menu is massive. I've never been to a restaurant with such a large menu. If you want it, chances are they have it - everything from tacos to filet mignon. The problem with this is that it's not easy to scan the menu.  I've been to this location a number of times since they opened. I've had an equally bad number of experiences as I've had good experiences. This is primarily due to the service, which is spotty at best.  If you are planning to visits this location, be sure to set aside a good 2-3 hours. Chances are you'll probably wait an hour. By the time you're seated, order drinks and peruse the menu, order appetizers, entrees, and finally finish your cheesecake another two hours has passed.  The cheesecake is quite good. My personal favorite is the Oreo Cheesecake. My advice, skip the meal and get the cheesecake to go."
Cedrick W.,"Nashville, TN",0,3,,3.0,2/8/2016,I always enjoy the settings at this restaurant. They get your food out quick but sometimes you have to wait longer than expected. I had the Pasta Scampi. It was well prepared. It was hot and I enjoyed every moment of it.  My waitress was great as well. She smiled the whole entire time she helped us. My type of customer service. I will definitely go back soon. When the time is right.
Michelle C.,"Chicago, IL",4,8,17,1.0,12/8/2014,"My first time eating here and I was really disappointed with the service and food. We ordered Stuffed Chicken Tortillas , Four Cheese Pasta with Shrimp, Dynamite Shrimp, and Spinach Artichoke. The cocktail Typhoon drink was delish. The Dynamite Shrimp, Spinach Dip, and Stuffed Tortillas were actually ok, but the Four Cheese Pasta was horrible. Not only did they send it out cold the first time but they sent it out cold the second time and reheated from the first time. Who does that???????? Well, I'm sorry but I had to take it to management only because our server was a little turd on top of everything else. I certainly believe in great service and great food and if I receive anything less, you will hear about it."
Knox M.,"Mount Juliet, TN",0,7,,3.0,5/11/2016,"Wonderful service. The food is pretty good with a wide menu. Had a veggie burger that was a 7/10. The fries were like McDonald's fries, but who doesn't love McDonald's fries. Price is a little steep for the quality of food and I would have tipped more for the awesome service if the food didn't cost as much."
Kristen C.,"Santa Rosa, CA",120,18,33,1.0,1/7/2014,"After waiting 1.5 hours, (as expected on a Saturday evening), the two of us were sat at a small table in the corner of the bar uncomfortably close to another couple. Our waiter, (whose name was never even divulged), approached our table in a hastily manner and greeted us with, ""What's going on here""? Puzzled by his abrupt greeting we replied in confusion that we'd like to start with the Warm Crab & Artichoke dip. I understand Saturday nights are hectic and the restaurant is extremely busy, however I did not find it appropriate to hasten our dining experience due to their inability to cater to multiple parties simultaneously. As our appetizer arrived and before we even took one bite, our server came out to tell us that it was a, ""23 minute ticket"", and that our entrees were already prepared. He asked us if we wanted it anymore to which we declined & requested our entrees. He proceeded to take our appetizer away, then returned with it saying it was on the house. One bite in, and I see something shiny hanging off my partner's cracker. It was dimly lit so I assumed it was a cheese strand, later to discover it was a blonde hair. Neither myself, nor my partner has blonde hair. As we showed our waiter, his response was, ""Good thing it was on the house"". I was appalled at his response to say the least. Our entrees arrived, and were delicious as expected. Approximately mid-way through our final course I noticed what I thought was a small fly on the wall directly next to my face. I asked my partner what it was, he replied, ""it's just as fly"". As I blew air at it in an attempt to make it disperse, it only crawled closer and closer towards me. I ripped a piece of napkin from the bread basket and squished the bug from the wall and threw it on a used appetizer plate on our table for closer examination. To our horror, it was a baby cockroach. At this point my meal and complete dining experience at Cheesecake Factory was utterly ruined. Our server got one of the managers, Jose, and he offered us free cheesecake (which I was not sure I even wanted), and to comp our entire meal, (water, an uneaten appetizer, two half eaten entrees, and a slice of cheesecake to go). He also ensured us that the restaurant gets, ""bombed"" every month and that the next scheduled was the upcoming week.  I understand completely that a fine establishment such as Cheesecake Factory would have such a long wait time on the busiest day of the week. With this understanding however, I am unsure as to why the staff is not properly trained, or adequate enough to accommodate these conditions. I also comprehend that poor timing, accidents, and uninvited creatures can happen. What is baffling to me is how ALL of these mishaps occurred in ONE night, to ONE dining party. I cannot imagine what that says about the restaurant as a whole. I was more disappointed than angry about the entire experience as I waited 1.5 hours for my anticipated delicious meal to be dissolved into a horrible nightmare and an empty stomach."
Sherita J.,"Antioch, TN",0,17,2,1.0,5/10/2016,"My husband and I had dinner at Cheesecake Factory recently, and as usual we received adequate food and adequate service. There was one issue though...there was a dog sitting two feet from our table.  Though it was the patio,  it is still disgusting. What about the safety of the other diners?  What if that dog, being a dog, decided to bite another patron?  Not only is having dogs in the restaurant  disgusting and unsanitary, it puts the restaurant and pet owner at risk for a lawsuit.  Why even take the risk?  Any number of things in that type of scenario can go wrong.  Really Cheesecake Factory, where is the consideration  for others?  Restaurants are for people.  If you guys want to have something for pets, then open a separate venue."
Jesse Q.,"Antioch, TN",104,262,431,5.0,2/28/2014,Went for lunch Very Busy so sat @the Bar the Bartender was waiting on like 15 people he was very Polite had Salmon with Greens beans and potatoes it was Very Delious ..Passed On desert was way to full
Vince H.,"Nashville, TN",398,80,101,3.0,4/12/2015,"I tried the Orange Chicken and was not a fan. I didn't get much, if any orange flavor. Pretty much tasted like a straight up peanut sauce. Service was also on the really slow side so I guess it was just an off day over all..."
Jerrod M.,"Temecula, CA",0,13,2,2.0,4/13/2016,Very slow waited over 5 minutes to get out drink order and just got worst from there. I will not be going back any time soon.
Aleeson P.,"Murfreesboro, TN",176,108,50,5.0,2/13/2012,"I've been to several other Cheesecake Factory in various places but the one at home has yet to disappoint me. This is probably one of the only franchises that I will visit on a regular basis.  My food is always what I expect. Fresh and flavorful. I was here Saturday, the 11th and had a passion-fruit mojito, delicious!  I highly recommend the Pasta Da Vinci, their macaroni ball appetizers, and their fish tacos."
