Heather B.,"Clarksville, TN",0,1,,1.0,11/7/2015,"Just left this Cheesecake Factory unsatisfied. The food was ok, but the wait was an hour long and the service was poor. Our waiter was Salvador (""Sal""), we ordered an appetizer, and after waiting 25 min. we asked why it hadn't been brought to us yet. Sal said ""he forgot about it but not to worry because our main food would be up shortly"". He didn't offer much of an apology for the mistake or anything. When our other food came, there was a large hair in one of our dishes. When we told Sal he again didn't give much of an apology. Sucky service and overpriced (yet decent tasting) food."
Shalena W.,"Chico, CA",11,4,,1.0,4/3/2016,"Omgoodness give our waiter a Red Bull!!! Sal was super slow, brought wrong drinks, didn't check up on us and we had to stop him. The food was gross... the southwest chicken sandwich came burnt and unflavorful. My cheesesteak sandwich was all fat and raw and soggy in the bottom and burnt on the top. My salad was  not fresh. My lettuce could have slid down my through it was so soggy. Never again."
Gerardo G.,"Huntsville, AL",9,43,9,5.0,2/16/2014,Food wise I love this place. I always come out satisfied. Portions are quite big. Cheesecake is delicious. Caesar salad was just ok.  Waiter were attentive and came around often.  I wish the sitting was a bit better. If you get a small table for two it is too close to other customers and plates will take up all the table space.  The wait is usually at least 1 hour but that's understandable. There is just one Cheesecake Factory around the area and many people like to come during the weekend.  Instead of regretting the long wait I plan to enjoy the afternoon and I walk around the mall while I wait. Time goes pretty fast.
Olivia W.,"Anchorage, AK",38,258,404,2.0,11/22/2011,"I have eaten here several times and all with the same conclusions. I am going to put all my pros and cons in list form as one of my previous yelpers has done (wonderful idea!). Easier on the eyes and more straight forward. Pros: The service is good about 50% of the time. You can eat outside depending on the day and if a seat is avaliable. The food has flavor to it.  SELECT cheesecakes are good. Red velevet is my personal favorite.   Cons: The wait here is atrotious.  The place is too dang big and I felt agoraphobic the whole time I was there. You cant hear yourself think. The menu is colossal and the advertisements are repugnant. Given their food portions are huge, their prices are just as high. It averages about 3,000 calories a meal. No wifi. Yea, seriously. The first thing I thought of when I walked in the place was ""I would hate for a tornado to roll through here"". Its very overbearing with all the plants and the eviroment is way to busy for my liking; that is coming from a simple minded person. The only reason I would come back here is to get the red velevet cheesecake- takeout."
Alishah N.,"Franklin, TN",22,107,9,3.0,3/11/2013,"I like the Cheesecake Factory for it's plethora of options. The joke being their menu is so huge they have to take out ads to support the printing costs. And, impressively, for a place that has American, Italian, Mexican, Japanese and more, they do it all quite well. Portions are huge, bread is really good, and desserts are worth skipping the main course. That being said, the wait at Cheesecake Factory's gotten to the point that we avoid it. Weekends, you can face a 90+ minute wait - and that was even for a table for 2. Brunch, Lunch and Dinner, the waits are getting to be a little crazy - the best times are off-peak times or weekdays. The last time we tried, we waited for an hour and 45 minutes and were told it may be another 10-15 minutes... I ended up handing off my pager to another couple who had just arrived, and my wife and I went elsewhere. So while the food is good, it lately has not been good enough to warrant the wait. Update: Wanting to give them another shot, I tried again on a Tuesday at 6:30. We were told it would be a half hour. An hour and 15 minutes later, we were told we were at the top of the list and just needed a table to free up. The manager said he would do a quick walk-around to see if any tables were clearing up, and finally after waiting about an hour and 20 minutes, we had our table. While the manager was apologetic, and even offered a complimentary appetizer, it's incredible to have waited almost 3 times the estimate we were given. Not sure why it's gotten like this, because I know just even a year ago it wasn't this bad."
Brandi H.,"Nashville, TN",5,50,,4.0,2/2/2013,"I know it's not ""cool"" to dig chains anymore but here's the facts: 1) the menu has 20-some-odd pages so everyone in your party will find something they like. 2) the portions are huge so everyone will be full. (And in my experience the food is consistently good, but I always order the same thing.... Fettuccini with chicken and sundried tomatoes). And 3) the cheesecakes are out of this world. Over 30 options and each tastes amazing. I've never had bad service here (I've had not amazing service, but not flat out bad). The wait is long but worth it."
Bridgette C.,"Nashville, TN",144,299,65,3.0,2/21/2013,"I may be alone in this but this isn't my favorite place to go, at least at this location.  It's always crowded with shoppers, and I kind of get overwhelmed by the 39852093-page menu of offerings.   But should I find myself here, if at all possible, I prefer to sit in the bar area, which seems to be a little bit more relaxed, and lacking a lot of the hazards of shopping bags littering the floor.  Also I love the service you get in the bar area.  The wait staff and bartenders are great here, maybe its because the clientele is a little more chill, compared to the rest of the dining room.   Either way, the convenience of shopping Green Hills mall and then getting a bite to eat cannot be beat, because unlike most malls, Green Hills doesn't really have a food court per se, just some snack shacks in the middle and then some surrounding restaurants.  But it doesn't suck entirely, and they have great brunches and I love their fish tacos.  Be prepared, their portion sizes cross into leviathan territory, so I'd recommend sectioning off a part for a later meal.  They also have great bloody marys.   It is always crowded and you typically have a wait unless a bar table is open, and as I've already said I recommend that.  I've been to other Cheesecake factories and enjoyed my experiences, so maybe its just the wall-to-wall wildness of this one that makes it off-putting.  But the staff have always been great and the food, while gigantic, is good.  And they have a nice patio for when the weather is sunny, but with cars slowly rolling by about five feet from you the smell of exhaust can get overpowering."
Piyush S.,"Nashville, TN",39,69,10,4.0,3/4/2013,"This place deserves more than it gets. People seem to be biased because of the chain restaurant tag. What if it had some fancy name and was located in east nashville, it would be ""the goto"" place. Oh yes. Check out the reviews for some east nashville, west meade restaurants which are overpriced and serving what they like to call "" new americana"", absolutely rubbish. Cheesecake is non pretentious joint which serves a little bit of everything, american, tex mex, japanese, chinese, continental and deserts are to die for and I absolutely love it.  The last time we had an apetizer which had buffalo wings stuffed in some triangles , grilled salmon and pork chops, it was all good."
PW D.,"Nashville, TN",1,29,15,1.0,8/10/2014,"Oh my. Hadn't been in ages & doubt we'll ever return.  Went from bad to worse! Early dinner: Shrimp soft tacos had to be sent back as they Tasted terrible. Vegetable salad was good but the grilled chicken on it was very dry, tough & overcooked. GM sent me new chicken but really not too good.  Pretty poor quality & flavor. Turkey burger was tasteless.  The frozen ones from Trader Joes are much better & cheaper!    This turkey burger was replacing the shrimp tacos.   Was a ridiculous wait on the burger.   Then had to ask for mustard.   Again, long wait.   We wanted to order cheesecake.  Said he'd be right back for order.   Never happened.  I got up ordered it at take out window, paid and was back at our table & server still had not returned.   We finally stood up.  Told the first person running past that we needed help to pay and leave.    It was a terrible experience   BAD FOOD.  NO SERVICE.    And I could not believe I paid 7.50 for such a small piece of cheesecake.        Clearly this chain has implemented poorer quality ingredients than before & needs some serious tightening up in the back & front of the house.    Don't waste your money.   Not worth the big prices.   Lots of other options."
Teresa H.,"Cary, NC",0,1,,1.0,9/10/2016,"Had a bad experience that the management staff simply made worse. Arrived last night and requested a patio table. Noticed that the table was wet which we pointed out to the hostess who simply said they had just sanitized them. After sitting down we noticed the smell of bleach and wondered about it. After ordering our drinks from the waitress, the other person in my party noticed a spot on her shirt. When she stood up to let me look at it, we discovered it was where bleach was bleaching out the color of the shirt. She turned around and we saw more spots on both her shirt and pants and then saw that my shirt was bleached as well. We immediately told the waitress who brought over the shift manager. She apologized profusely and admitted she had cleaned the area with bleach to try and get rid of a major fly problem they had been having. We moved to a table inside where we were told they would take care of our meal and they just wanted us to relax and enjoy our meal and not worry about anything and she would check on how they would take care of our clothes problem. We ordered 2 appetizers, drinks and cheesecake as we had originally planned. We were told we would have to buy replacement garments and bring back receipts to be sent to corporate who would reimburse us. When we were ready to leave, I was brought a bill with a single appetizer comped after being told the entire would be covered. Returned today with receipts for replacement clothing and spoke to the general manager who was flippant and acted like HE was being inconvenienced by having to deal with this! Also made him aware that we were told the meal would be covered and then were handed the bill with the single appetizer comped and wanted to know if he would make it right and give us credit as we had been told. Again he acted annoyed and begrudgingly said he would see what he could do. We will be contacting corporate ourselves to see if they will make this right. It is offensive to be treated like we are being a problem when we are the ones that had our clothes ruined by their mistake and our day was disrupted with having to go search for replacements today instead of doing what we planned because I am visiting from out of town just for the weekend. Good customer service means you put the customer first and make things right when you mess up. And you most certainly do not make the customer feel like you are the one being inconvenienced and that they (the customer) are being unreasonable. And you absolutely do not lie and say you will cover a meal and then hit them with the bill at the end!"
Maritza M.,"Houston, TX",10,232,33,5.0,9/17/2014,"Always a good meal and a fantastic dessert,  of course! We were a group of 6 high school friends (now in our 60's) who were in Nashville for a Girlfriends Getaway, and chose CF for lunch. Our wonderful server provided top notch service,  even allowing us to remain there for nearly 4 hours,  laughing and reminiscing about long ago adventures. That the food was awesome bears repeating."
Russell M.,"Scottsdale, AZ",2,108,8,4.0,2/5/2015,This place is always above average and the service definitely  stood out this time. Our server was polite and on top of everything.  Whatever there business model is for hiring and training there are a ton of franchises that should practice it. The only reason for the missing the 5th star is the seating. My wife and I went here for date night and the seating was awful. We where so close to other people on both sides I felt I should introduce myself. There was zero privacy in our conversation. Maybe next time I will ask for better seating.
Samantha S.,"San Francisco, CA",124,132,1361,4.0,6/27/2013,"The only bad part about this place is the wait.  Good lord Nashville loves them some Cheesecake Factory! This restaurant is definitely a guilty pleasure of mine.  I feel like I shouldn't like it but I keep coming back.  With 280 menu items, there is literally something for everyone.  The portions are massive and always consistently good.  I usually go for a few small plates or a pasta (then take the other half home)  HUGE, I tell ya! Drink prices are a bit high but the food is priced for what you get.  If the mall is still open when you arrive and there is a wait, you can grab a pager and walk around the mall for a little shopping!"
John S.,"San Antonio, TX",19,99,8,3.0,4/23/2013,"Solid place with good food and good service, but nothing that's really superb. For the price, the portions are very generous and some of the dishes are huge (esp. the burrito). There is also a huge variety of options to choose from. The bread is actually really good and the desserts are delicious (after all, it IS called the CHEESECAKE factory) but I rarely get them because it's about 8-9 dollars for a slice of cheesecake which seems almost unjustifiable except just for the experience. Can't really find anything to complain about but there's not really anything special either to bump it up to 4 stars. All in all it is a solid place that will not disappoint."
Derrick W.,"Dickson, TN",27,26,26,5.0,1/27/2015,"Love the Cheesecake Factory but HATE Green Hills............Thankfully, Cool Springs is NOW open and I will try that location in the future!  Warning for those of you who never been, their food is BIG portions and you won't finish it all.........especially the cheesecake!  So many different favored cheesecakes to choose from too!"
James L.,"Somerville, AL",39,57,58,3.0,12/22/2014,"Visited the Cheesecake Factory in the Green Hills Mall in Nashville, TN. Sunday night wait time was around 30 min so it wasn't too terrible. And we busied ourselves by wandering through the shops close by. Seated, ordered 4 waters, and got our bread without any hesitation or anything of note. We ordered our food (4 cheese pasta with chicken, Skinnylicious chicken pasta, and I can't remember what the other two in our group got.) and it came out pretty promptly. The servings are large, but the chicken in my pasta might've amounted up to a half of a chicken breast if I'm honest. My girlfriend wasn't overly happy about about her pasta either because it looked more like a bowl full of diced tomatoes with a smattering of pasta noodles. To me it was not worth the $17 for mine, or for hers. But, they were alright. Then we went onto dessert. I'm a sucker for a classic cheesecake. No strawberries, no cherries, no sauce. Plain ol' cheesecake. My girlfriend on the other hand, is not the cheesecake connoisseur that I consider myself. She got the Oreo cheesecake, and when it was all over, it looked like someone had murdered a pack of oreos and whipped cream on her plate. We were happier with dessert than the meal, but even with that, I don't feel it was quite worth the $50 plus tip that the bill came out to."
Krystal E.,"Southaven, MS",63,112,318,4.0,11/15/2012,"This restaurant is chain in flavor & definitely not ""local"".  But they have some of the BEST tasting Balsamic Vinaigrette that you can purchase in a mason jar and take home! I've had many of the flavors of cheesecakes they offer and many of them are not that spectacular, but the Pumpkin Pecan Pie and Carrot Cake Cheesecake are worth making a special trip. If you are watching your caloric intake, this is NOT the restaurant to visit. Check the site for cals before you scarf that rich, creamy, sugar-laiden dessert!"
Kathy C.,"Nashville, TN",178,62,4,3.0,7/6/2014,"This review is on the lunch / dinner menu NOT the cheesecake. I'VE HAD SEVERAL  DIFFERENT FLAVORS OF THEIR CHEESECAKE AND THEY ARE ALL DELICIOUS!! All of them.  Now for the food menu- the food is pretty good. We've eaten many, many items from TCF and most everything is good but I take issue with the sides.  For example, the fried shrimp is delicious but it comes with fries and cole slaw. I'd love to have the option to have fresh vegetables instead.  The catfish platter does come with fresh vegs but most items don't. If you order a steak it comes with fries. Several items on the menu come with- you guessed it- FRIES.  Now for the cheesecake. If you want the best cheesecake you may have ever had, this is where to get it. OMG. The slices are huge so I always take it home. I like to be very hungry when I eat my cheesecake, but  I rarely eat it all in one sitting. It's rich and creamy and a huge serving.  I've ordered whole cheesecakes for holidays. They recommend letting it thaw for 24 hours but it's still a bit frozen after that. Let it thaw 48 hours and it's perfect.  3 stars on the food. 5 stars on the cheesecake!"
Anna C.,"Philadelphia, TN",0,3,,5.0,1/27/2016,Love their Cheesecakes and their yummy mac and cheese balls are just excellent. Pastas are good but for me they need a tiny bit more flavor and a little more shrimp or chicken. Other than than I love knoxville's TN Cheesecake factory!
Nancy L.,"Vincennes, IN",1,67,10,3.0,1/21/2014,"This is the second time I've been to a Cheesecake Factory and I love them because they are so huge inside and pretty! They have a large menu (if you're picky like I am, you might want to skip out on a CF). Although it is pretty pricey, it is a nice experience if you've never been. My boyfriend had a Macaroni and Cheese Burger that he just went on and on about it being the best hamburger he'd ever had. I was really glad he liked it that much. I would recommend going."
