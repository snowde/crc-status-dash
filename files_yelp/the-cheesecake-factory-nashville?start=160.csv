Faith J.,"Hendersonville, TN",363,104,54,5.0,12/12/2012,I love the Tai lettuce wraps!!! Of course the Cheescake is to die for... When you buy gift certificates this year for Christmas they are giving you a coupon for a free slice of cheesecake good anytime after dec 25
Loser F.,"Nashville, TN",0,10,15,2.0,1/14/2015,"Where do I start...well I made reservations for a party but when I arrived they said my wait would be an hour and a half....I ended up waiting 2 hours. The lighting was nice but a little dark but overall the environment was very nice. The food isn't worth the price...but the cheese cake is really good. I bought an appetizer, entree, and a cheese cake and my total came up to $40 just for me. I wouldn't recommend this place If you have small kids. If the food was better I would have gave it 3 or 4  stars."
Katie D.,"Austin, TX",69,282,5,4.0,5/20/2012,"I like this place, it's certainly the best option at the Mall at Green Hills. I'm from out of town so when I visit this mall, the food court options have no appeal to me (I can have Chick-fil-A at home, thanks) so I try to pick places I can't have back home. Thus, when I'm there I go for Cheesecake Factory. To be technical, I'd probably give them a 3.5/5 - they're not awful, but they don't live up to the hype nearly as much as they should, given whenever you go there's always a wait. I mean hey, good for them to not be hurting for business, but it sucks when you're on a time crunch and don't have time to wait 20 minutes to be seated, especially when it usually ends up being 30-35 minutes in a tiny, cramped space where there's never enough seats and always too many antsy kids. But hey, the waiting area is never that big in restaurants. But the noise level of the restaurant is ridiculous. The acoustics suck (and do in all locations, I've been to others) and it causes everyone to echo, giving it a noisy, cafeteria-like atmosphere. Hardly the upscale-but-still-kinda-casual vibe they're going for. Other than that though, it's not bad. They have some of the best lemonade I've ever had. Most restaurants offer crappy Minute Maid, so it's nice to get it at places like this where it's freshly squeezed, and the sugar rimmed glasses are a nice touch. The menu is just ridiculous, in both a good and bad way. Especially on your first visit it's just plain overwhelming, and there's some stuff that's just not that good. Though some of what I've had is great: - The American Kobe burger sucks. Save the money and get a regular burger. The meat doesn't taste any different and isn't any more tender than a burger you'd get at Chili's. + Chicken and biscuits are good. Their biscuits are a shortcake batter so they're interesting, and their gravy's good, though I'm sure it's pre-made. - The fish and chips suck. They're frozen, for starters. And for someone who's had authentic fish and chips overseas, wrapped in newspaper...it's a huge disappointment. + The crab cake is good. I don't get it, but someone I go with usually does who's from the Maryland area originally so it must be okay. I've only had their cheesecake once since the portions are so huge. I can never make room for it. But the serving of cheesecake is small, far smaller than the cheesecake I've had anywhere else. It was good though, I just can't remember if I tried the key lime or the vanilla bean cheesecake. Maybe I've had both, but regardless their cheesecake is good. Just tiny and pricy."
Dee B.,"Clarksville, TN",87,118,198,5.0,8/30/2012,"Great customer service, went for lunch, not a long wait. Great food. If you love carrot cake like I do, I would reccommend the Carrot Cheesecake. It's absolutely delicious. If you like banana pudding, the banana cheesecake is great too.  The menu of course is huge. Super wide selection. And they offer lunch portions."
Rebeca F.,"Murfreesboro, TN",3,31,10,5.0,10/25/2014,My favorite restaurant in general so many selection the atmosphere is amazing I go here when I'm feeling fancy lol.. But great customer service and amazing Food
Amelia V.,"Nashville, TN",12,9,1,1.0,6/1/2014,"It was so crowded, when you walked in, the place looked like a mad house. Something must have happened to our server because she disappeared after taking our drink order and never came back for our food order. We had to flag somebody down and they took care of us for the rest of our service. The food was alright, but my drink was more expensive than my entree! I don't feel the need to return for a long while."
FoodCritic 6.,"Nashville, TN",7,63,24,5.0,10/8/2014,Food and service here is great! Just a little over board with the price. However it is Green Hills!
Anna L.,"Nashville, TN",1,52,3,4.0,6/8/2013,"Although it is a chain restaurant, you really can't go wrong with The Cheesecake Factory. Yes, the wait can be atrocious. But again, look at where you're choosing to go eat. It can be very overwhelming if you go on the weekend due to crazy traffic near the mall and the plethora of people everywhere as soon as you open the front doors.  Foodwise, it has always been delicious. I've had some items from their Skinnylicious menu, which didn't disapoint me. I had to balance it out with some cheesecake of course!"
Lauren S.,"Washington, DC",22,334,10,3.0,5/28/2012,"I'm not quite sure why... but this place is packed. All the time. The food isn't bad and the cheesecake is actually pretty darn good, but I refuse to wait longer than 15 minutes for average chain restaurant food. It's the kind of place that literally has EVERYTHING so picky eaters will have lots of options to chose from. I do appreciate the ""skinnylicious"" menu (though I'll admit to feeling pretty stupid using the name when I order from it.)  Cost: A glass of wine & the skinnylicious pear and endive salad (including tip) is $29.  Tips: Portions are enormous and entrees can easily be shared. You can order a whole cheesecake to go for about $50 (depending on the flavor.)"
K T.,"Nashville, TN",9,37,4,5.0,7/16/2014,"For a chain restaurant with a huge menu, they do a great job with food. The Moroccan Chicken is very good. The shrimp and chicken gumbo was well like by my son. The plate portion is big. The cheesecake is very good."
Howard L.,"Nashville, TN",0,86,2,2.0,2/9/2012,"I'd love to see Gordon Ramsay eat at a Cheesecake Factory. I'm sure he'd rip it a new butt-hole for it's super-huge menu of average food. And I'd love to take a tour of their kitchen....the quality of some of the produce I've received has been questionable. It's average if you're lucky. Most of the time it's this side of cafeteria food. The fish and chips is a good example. I think you get better from Gordon's in the frozen food aisle.  Pros include the wait staff dress like they're ship stewards. If you look up, you'll notice how tall and useless looking the ceiling is. The drinks taste fine, although they're incredibly expensive. Getting wasted here is not cost effective.  I hesitate to say this, as it might cause a lemming like exodus to the restaurants that aren't as busy, but (never mind). Carraba's completely blows now and I wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy. Cheeseburger Charley's is great if you're looking for a quick bite. Avoid this crappy chain with poorly trained cooks. I'm guessing there's a bank of microwaves in the back next to the deep fat fryer."
Fonda W.,"Temple, TX",24,314,319,5.0,1/8/2012,"I love, love their stackhouse burgers, lettuce wraps, chicken & biscuits & sliders. If you've never been before & have hard times deciding on what to eat you may want to look at the menu online cuz it's VERY long & EVERYTHING is so tasty. The cheesecakes are a whole new story. There are too many to choose from & they don't offer samples or let you try them out prior to purchase. So you have to spend the $7 or $8 HOPING you're gonna like the one you've picked out. Majority of the ones I've tasted were good, my favorite is the white chocolate caramel macadamia nut!! Yummmmm!! But if you like the plain one with strawberries that's another favorite as well."
Lisa C.,"Franklin, TN",17,7,38,5.0,6/17/2014,"Yum, so good went for dinner tonight loved the salmon appetizer rolls. Key Lime cheesecake was phenomenal definitely going back soon. Heard they are opening one closer to Franklin soon!"
Nashville T.,"Nashville, TN",0,41,4,5.0,6/16/2014,The best run Cheesecake Factory I have been to.  Awesome grilled artichokes.  Great French salad that they will add poached egg to.  Always fresh with great staff.  How do they do manage to do this!
Mark H.,"Parker, CO",10,370,110,4.0,3/18/2014,"Walking up to this place is knowing that you're in for a long wait.  By the time you fight through the gaggle of mall-goers, teenie-boppers, and moms looking for something you finally put your name in and the wait is always more than 45mins. (THATS WHY YOU SIT IN THE BAR!!!)   Luckily this place has a bar and bar tables just in case you get impatient and can't wait for a real table...that is if you can get one.  Point is, this place is packed...all the time.   The menu is gi-normous and can be easily mistaken for a magazine with all the dumb adds it has.   Yah, I am not so sure how necessary it is to have these adds on their menu, but what the hell do I know about running a restaurant. Everything I have had there was satisfying.  Haven't tried everything, I don't have the budget or patience to wait.  The salads are so large they are impossible to finish, who can eat that much lettuce! I do have an extra room for dessert.  If you are calling yourself Cheesecake Factory, you have to live up to the namesake.  I've had some of the best desserts, the kinds you don't want to share, but you have to because you don't want to come off as a greedy pig...no one likes that.  Red Velvet Cheesecake is the BEST!!!!"
R R.,"Nashville, TN",0,5,,1.0,12/29/2014,"Ate there with my family while shopping at the mall christmas week.  Food was very mediocre and little to no taste.  The margareta pizza was not hot, crust was tasteless and sauce was all sugar with no taste.  I assume it was a frozen pie.  The fish tacos did have fresh avocado but again temperature was cool and tasteless.  drinks ok but very expensive.  there are much better options in the area.  I assume people go there for the atmosphere and the desserts.  We did not purchase any desserts.  overall a very poor food experience."
Sara G.,"Antioch, TN",14,27,7,5.0,5/20/2014,"I had a great visit to The Cheesecake Factory. I hadn't been in years. I love the many small plates and appetizer options! I wasn't very hungry and the Basil, Mozzarella and Tomato Flatbread was the perfect size. Especially if you want to save room for cheesecake and who doesn't?! Our waitress was fantastic especially considering we came in one hour before the restaurant closed on a Monday night. I will definitely be back."
Jamie A.,"Belmont/Hillsboro, Nashville, TN",222,191,10,4.0,8/2/2011,"Okay...I drank the Kool-Aid...on a Sunday lunchtime, no less.   While it is an utter circus and does not understand the concept of ""Less is More"" (18 page menu?!?), the food we ordered was actually really good.    Since we got there before 3 we were able to order lunch sized entrees.  My mom opted for the Thai peanut pasta (I think?) and I decided to go for the Louisiana chicken pasta.  Mine was very tasty, but rich and I maybe ate 1/3 of the lunchtime portion.  My mom loved her Thai pasta and was pleasantly surprised by the bean sprouts on top.  For a shared starter we opted for the corn fritters at the suggestion of our server.  They were absurdly good and seemed fresh as opposed to what I assumed would be pre-made frozen fritters.  They were served with a zesty remoulade.  And of course we tried some strawberry cheesecake.  We each maybe ate two bites, but they were tasty bites. My only real complaint (besides the insane crowd) was that the mimosas were 99% OJ...very little sparkle."
Ruiqiu K.,"Loma Linda, CA",32,580,7,5.0,12/24/2011,"I've been to several locations of the Cheesecake Factory in California. Each time, the wait was long, the menu was extensive, and the portions are huge. I came in fully expecting the above and this place did not disappoint. I love their menu and I love how big the place is. I know better than to come in during lunchtime. But, work closed at noon, and I had to give this place a try since I was in the area. The place was predictably packed. People who got their pagers were all milling around in the wait area or in the chairs in the foyer.  I was told my wait time was 20 minutes. In actuality, it was more half an hour.  But I've waited up to 2 hours before at the Sacramento location during 3PM, way after a lunch rush. I've been craving Mexican, so I had their green chile burger. It was okay. The fries were crispy. And the Snickers cheesecake was awesome. They use a lot of whipped cream to top the cheesecake -- there was more volume of whipped cream than cheesecake. Service was very attentive. I like how they offer you bread and butter while you wait for your meal.  A weird thing happened to me when I was here. I dropped my knife and the women at the table next to me didn't even offer to pick it up for me to refuse them to do so. No acknowledgment even though the knife made a loud noise. I've never experienced aloof, unhelpful strangers before. This must be the snotty rich I have only read about. Perhaps they expected the wait staff to pick it up for me.  At any rate, I like this place. Knowing they have tons of options on their menu just makes me want to come back to try the things I couldn't decide to get the first few times."
Jenna M.,"Kenmore, NY",48,6,,2.0,6/27/2014,"I Always, always loved going to The Cheesecake Factory, however, this one located in Green Hills was not even close to my all time fave in Westbury, NY. The wait time was incredibly long- which usually is @ the Factory, and I usually don't mind knowing how good the food will be. Their food was mediocre, service absolutely failed and Location was definitely lacking."
