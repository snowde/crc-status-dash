Elliott W.,"Franklin, TN",132,195,10,3.0,6/12/2011,"I finally decided to return to the Cheesecake Factory after a 4 year hiatus when we discovered that without reservations to our initial first choice date restaurant, we would have a 3 hour wait. Since we were passing the Green Hills mall anyway, we pulled in to the parking lot and entered the Cheesecake factory. We found a seat in the bar area very quickly and were promptly greeted by one of 2 servers who helped us. Both were very friendly and attentive. Then to the menu. I really don't know how they do this menu. It's literally about 20 pages long. Just keeping these ingredients fresh and on hand has to be a major undertaking, especially for the less popular items. Truly, it is overwhelming and could be trimmed back a little. I ended up with the garlic noodles and shrimp. It was hot and good. Not great. The shrimp were a hair tough and the asparagus so hot, i think it might have been in the microwave for a moment...It's the only way I know to get food that hot without burning it. We enjoyed a couple of Mojitos. They were very good, but for $9, they really should be. The cheesecake was excellent but sterile.  I've come to be such a fan of the Aux Choix cheesecake served at Whiskey Kitchen and the Franklin Mercantile  that Cheesecake Factory is just good but not great. In the end, Cheesecake factory is definitely a quality meal, but still a chain -- everything is just a little too predictable, too standardized, too heartless. But unlike most chains, the standards seem to raise the bar instead of setting a minimum level of mediocrity."
Tiffany M.,"Olive Branch, MS",1,3,,5.0,7/31/2014,I was very impressed by the quality and quantity of our cheesecake. Also extremely impressed by our personable waitress and her recommendations. My mom and I ordered red velvet cheesecake and Godiva chocolate cheesecake. Wonderful! 5 stars all the way around!
Caroline H.,"Cambridge, MA",85,160,27,3.0,1/8/2012,"I tend to think of Cheesecake factory as overpriced Applebee's, but today I tried the new Skinnylicious menu. And I liked it! I got the chicken soft tacos and it was a huge portion (I didn't finish it) for under 590 calories. I also tried my friend's Tuscan chicken which was pretty good.  I couldn't find the actual calorie count online for any of the Skinnylicious items, which seems a little fishy, but I want to trust that I made good decisions today (New Year's Resolutions- what what!). Good: Now you don't have to eat 4million calories when your friend drags you to Cheesecake factory! Bad: It's kinda overpriced Applebee's...still."
Valerie T.,"Irving, TX",11,28,14,1.0,3/17/2014,"We just walked out without eating.  Im not sure what was going on tonight cause its a Monday evening and the mall is deserted.  You wouldn't think it would be a crazy night or anything but evidently something was up.  We waited 15 minutes before we were seated. Then the host took us to a table that had a tub filled with dirty dishes in the seat and the check still on the table. Kind of an awkward start but it can happen. After we were seated for about 5 mins, our waiter came by and brought another waiter with him. He said the second guy would be helping him out for a minute but that he would be right with us.  The second waiter took our drink order and then brought our drinks but that was it.  He left us and our initial waiter passed us by repeatedly never taking our order and didn't even look at us. It got so weird and we were really hungry, we finally just left. Boooooo!!!!!"
D. H.,"Hendersonville, TN",17,258,192,3.0,11/20/2014,"I think The Cheesecake Factory is riding on their reputation amongst wannabe ""foodies"" that they are the last good chain restaurant. I say this because, at least at this location, cleanliness and other such ""surface"" issues seem to be taking a backseat because they know people will still file in by the dozen and pay the over-priced cost of their meals. During my most recent visit, our table was not wiped down properly before we were seated as there were obvious crumbs on the table. The service was decent but a bit too clingy and earnest. The menu, as always, is almost overwhelming with choices but the majority of the entrees here are really good which makes up, for most people, for everything else. The Cheesecake is the big draw, but while I have never had a bad piece of cheesecake here, I don't find it so special that it is necessarily worth the price or the calories. Yet I would go back for many of these entrees and appetizers. My favorite is the Thai Lettuce Wraps."
Leslie P.,"Nashville, TN",105,144,97,4.0,3/20/2012,"I hadn't been to the Cheesecake Factory in quite a while and it has yet to dissappoint.  I recently visited the Green Hills location.  I had forgotten how expansive the menu was.  From Italian to Thai, Spanish and American, the entree choices were hard to make.   I did remember the portions being huge and we knew we couldn't leave there without have a piece of cheesecake, so we decided to share the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp and the White Chocolate Macadamian Nut Cheesecake.  Doesn't that just sound delightful?   White   Chocolate   Macadamian   Nut   Cheesecake Well, it was.  The Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp is a spicy Thai dish flavored with Curry, Peanut, Chile, Coconut and is mixed with vegetables and rice. It was delicious as well. The experience couldn't have been better as far as the food goes, the seating and drinks could use some improvement.  After waiting over an hour to be seated (expect that on a weekend night), we were seated in the dreadful ""bistro"" seating which consists of small two person tables that are arranged and separated by less than ten inches.  Boo.  It's hard not only for the servers to help you, but it's even harder to have a private conversation.  My husband and I got a kick out of the situation, but we will probably order dinner out next time we want the Cheesecake Factory for that reason."
Terrell L.,"Nashville, TN",51,367,520,5.0,5/11/2011,"I was seated outside, a beautiful evening with family and Cheesecake.  The Indian Taco was Great."
Demitri K.,"Nashville, TN",0,4,,3.0,5/20/2014,Really really expensive but the food is pretty good. I really only go for the good service and the nice surrounding and it's never really my idea...nothing terrible and nothing extraordinary.
Kaleena 'Kala' H.,"Nashville, TN",35,152,,2.0,9/16/2011,"I'm not a huge fan of the Cheesecake Factory. The one time that I came here for lunch...I ordered a grilled chicken caesar salad, and all I got was a giant bowl of lettuce with about 4 pieces of chicken buried in it.  The cheesecake is good, but all in all I am not satisfied with the food and the service."
Joshua B.,"Nashville, TN",169,88,36,3.0,5/7/2013,"The ONLY reason this place gets 3 stars is because of the service (if it weren't for him - it'd be 2 stars). So, look - there are some reasons why you would go to Cheesecake Factory: 1.)  You are at Green Hills Mall 2.)  You really enjoy mediocre chain food 3.)  You love menus that are longer than any Harry Potter Book 4.)  You enjoy good Cheesecake 5.)  Someone gave you a gift card and you haven't been able to use it yet 6.)  You are a tourist #5 was my reason.   So, I went to my first Cheesecake factory in Atlanta years ago (and several other since).  It was ok.  Long wait, mediocre food, good cheesecake, terrible service.  When they finally came to Nashville - my boyfriend at the time and I went to check it out.  We waited for nearly 2 hours for a table.  When we were finally seated - we were seated at a 4 Top table (table large enough for 4 people).  It was a terrible table.  When we were seated - we recognized how awful the table was and asked if we could be seated at a different table.  In fact, right next to this table was another 4 Top that was much nicer.  The person that sat us rolled her eyes and said ""If you want a different table you'll have to go back up front and wait for a different table...""  What?  What difference did it make?  Why would we be required to wait longer when we already waited 2 hours.  Needless to say that attitude coupled with the mediocre food, terrible service and high price kept me away until now.  I had a gift card and, until recently, had sat in my wallet for nearly 2 years.  It was time to clean it out.  So, another trip to Cheesecake Factory was in order so I took a friend with me. This time the wait wasn't so long.  We only waited about 45 minutes.  Still, that was quite a long time to wait.  We were seated and, before long, the server was out to see us and got our drink order.   I am one of those people who drinks like a fish - so, most servers have a hard time keeping up with me.  This guy had NO problem. Many times I was taking my last sip and bam - another glass was right there.  I was impressed! We ordered our food and when it came - there were 2 problems.  First, my friend's order was wrong and second - the fries that came with my buffalo chicken sandwich were cold.  Like, not even the slightest bit warm.   Here comes the part where I was really impressed - the manager, without prompting from us, came to our table with a new plate for my roomie, realizing that the order was wrong.  I'm guessing perhaps two people ordered the same thing and they sent the wrong plate to our table.  in defense of Cheesecake factory - he ordered a dish with chicken and shrimp and asked for just chicken.  It came with both...so, it's not the way it's traditionally served.  But, they had the correct order on the table just moments after the 'wrong' one arrived.  Nice! I never did complain about my fries because, after all, I was just here trying to spend a gift card and I'd likely never come back anyway.  So, I was afraid if I complained they might take it off my order and then I'd be left with more money to spend...and I didn't want that. All in all - the service was impressive, the food was blah and the cheesecake was, of course, incredible.   If you want a good place to eat in Nashville - this is NOT it.  If you want a place to get a good piece of cheesecake - by all means - stop by.   I really do wish that server the best, though.  He was incredible.  But, other than the cheesecake and the service - I have never, ever found a reason, food wise, to return.  The food is overpriced and of mediocre quality.  The food seems very chain-like and corporate.  AKA - nothing to write home about.   But, if you fit one of the 6 reasons above to go - by all means...Just be expected to wait."
Robby E.,"Nashville, TN",2,26,1,4.0,10/27/2010,"Let's look at the menu for a moment.  5,000 separate items, 4,975 of which contain chicken.  Who decided we wanted so gosh darned much chicken?  And advertising.  When I'm preparing to drop $100.00+ on some variety of chicken, I do not need my wife to be reminded of diamonds.  Really. The ceiling is unrealistically high, so the place is noisy, and the décor would be a bit unsettling if you could see it.   On to the service.  We went on a Friday evening and very surprisingly, we didn't have much of a wait.  It didn't hurt that there were only two of us and we were willing to take a table in the bar.  Our waiter was Jason and he was phenomenal.   And the food.  I don't know jacket-boo about wine, so I don't know if the house merlot was good or bad, but it went nicely with bread and butter.  And the bread was warm.  My wife's chicken thing was delicious, and there was a full paddy of rice to go with it.  She took a good bit of it home.  My ribeye steak was huge, and I finished it only because I was under the impression that it might be free if I could do so in under an hour. Despite being REALLY full, we ordered desert, because, well, duh.  My wife had some sort of chocolate coconut cheesecakey delight.  It also was huge, and a lot of it came home with us.  I asked Jason for the highest calorie desert on the menu and he brought me red velvet cheesecake.  Time stopped.  I considered eating the plate. To sum it up: I'm calling the Cheesecake Factory a win.  Silly menu and pointless hanging lamps aside, we had a more enjoyable evening here than we expected."
Russell L.,"Morgantown, WV",165,6,,1.0,6/3/2013,"The Cheesecake Factory is what it is. It's a chain that has large portions with good cheesecake. The service is tremendous as always. However when I visited this location recently it was dirty. This is unacceptable. Dirty floors, dirty silverware, dirty linens, sticky table and filthy menu. I have been to many CFs, including this one at Green Hills before. I have never experienced such a dirty restaurant like I did that evening. That doesn't deter me from the brand, but it does this location."
Robert S.,"Nashville, TN",70,20,1,2.0,12/10/2014,"I ordered the Salmon salad off the ""skinnylicious"" menu.  The baked salmon was ice cold.  I get it, you have 75 pages of menu items so you pre-make a lot of stuff, but seriously - ice cold baked salmon?  so gross."
Mathew P.,"Walnut Creek, CA",10,64,2,1.0,7/17/2010,"This review is directed at all Cheesecake Factories, not just this one. However, since this was the Cheesecake Factory that pushed me over the line, it's the one that gets the brunt of my fury. Does no one notice that Cheesecake Factory is garbage? Like everyone, I was ""in love"" with the Cheesecake Factory. I was excited when one would pop up near me. In retrospect, this is only because I was ""told"" to like the Cheesecake Factory. Who doesn't like it? They have a gigantic menu! They say And thus, the cooks backstage cannot cook a single one of them well It's fun! No, it isn't. It's smoke and mirrors. A Rainforest Cafe sans animatronic monkeys and elephants. Good service! meh, it's too big of a chain to determine, but I got plenty of crap service here. Wait! Yup. Always a f'in wait. For crap. Think about it. Why do you like the Cheesecake Factory? Really consider it. I truly believe once someone things long and hard about the Cheesecake Factory, that person too will have an epiphany. Same holds true for Dane Cook. That's it! Cheesecake Factory is the Dane Cook of restaurants! Ok, rant over."
Mike A.,"Franklin, TN",0,4,,4.0,3/2/2014,Great drinks and apps. Not just for cheesecake.  Menu is so big everyone can find something. Make sure you try the Mac and cheese side dish. It's fantastic!
Patrick H.,"CANE RIDGE, TN",22,21,1,2.0,6/27/2012,"I hear a lot of people talk about The Cheesecake Factory and on how great it is. I don't see what all the hype is all about really. Great how??? Decided to go on a Sunday afternoon around 5pm. First off, we had to wait about 30 min to be seated. I got a great view of seeing people enter and exit the restaurant every 5 seconds. Plus, it was raining and we couldn't wait in the lobby because there were 50 people waiting to be seated and about 20 people waiting to get cheesecake. After the wait, we had to go searching for the host and finally we heard him screaming over the crowd. We were seated next to two other couples. I felt like I was in a school cafeteria. I could reach over and slap the woman next to me or eat off her plate if I wanted to...but I would never do anything that crazy, but you get the idea. We were that close to each other. I really didn't like the fact we were able to hear other people's conversation in full detail. This place is extremely loud. You can't keep anything private unless you're in your own booth, which, that's where I wish we were. The table was small and before the server finally arrived at our table, I was ready to go. I got frustrated going through the menu and I wanted it to be over, so I decided to get the Smoke Burger, or whatever it's called. I've had a better burger at Burger King and I think the fries were just ok. I'm sure other things on the menu are good, but I'll never find out. The only reason I'm giving this two stars and not one is because the server was really nice and professional. The food was at our table fast and she did a good job checking on us to see if we needed anything. She was tipped very well and if I knew her name, I would name drop and give her kudos for her hard work. My opinion, go to Cheesecake Factory for the cheesecake only and get it to go! If you like waiting, loud conversation, food that you could probably get better at Applebee's and bumping into people, go for it. Don't believe the hype!! Thank you."
Matthew D.,"Venice, CA",69,228,33,2.0,8/2/2010,"After watching my boss spend $2k on a piece of CARRY-ON LUGGAGE at Louis Vuitton, we both decided our cheapest option to kill time before dinner would be at the bar. Enter Charles, the Cheesecake Factory bartender. The man has a heavy hand with the Maker's, I'll tell you what. Three Maker's and Cokes laid me out for the night and I'm a big guy. We ended up getting a table for our group of ten. After that, all I remember is ordering the Cajun Jambalaya pasta, eating some of it (reliably tasty) and getting stuck with the check for the table (despite my president and senior vp being there). Oh yeah, I had some cheesecake too but they wouldn't let us order some new peanut butter cheesecake because we didn't become fans on Facebook and print a screenshot to prove it. I believe the new flavor was going to be released to the general public in a few days. Let me tell you, this really pissed me off when I remembered that it happened. I f***ing hate exclusive promotions like this, especially when there is a big sign in the lobby touting the new cheesecake. They lose a star because of that bullshit. In fact, it will probably cost them some of my business in the future, especially when I have nine other people with me."
LaTamera W.,"Hermitage, TN",15,153,75,1.0,7/13/2013,This place is dirty and nasty. I do not see the big deal. Overhyped.
Russ A.,"Memphis, TN",5,19,34,2.0,8/11/2013,Cheesecake was awesome but the rest of the experience was a little lame. I'm always instantly nervous when I see big fake columns and murals painted on the ceiling. I was right... This place was as pretentious as it looked.  The menu was overly large..almost too much to take in.  There was everything from salads and burgers to wannabe fine dining dishes.  The wait staff were overly fussy .. it was just an expensive average quality meal trying very hard to punch above its weight. My advice...order the cheesecake to.go and enjoy it somewhere more comfortable and less pretentious..
Brandon L.,"Spring Hill, TN",41,165,127,4.0,10/24/2010,"The Cheesecake Factory is a great place to eat, but this particular location seems to have some issues... Although I have to give them some grace because they are considered ""the largest restaurant in the state of Tennessee"" according to my waiter. I could believe that. Considering the non stop flow people going in and out of this place. There was people on the waiting list for at least an hour or more at all times. We came threw here at about 8pm and did not get a table until 9:15 pm... This place is poppin! Everyone wants to eat here! I have been to this location multiple times before this review. They do try their best to give everyone the best experience possible. But there is so many people that things can get a little crazy.  Our bread was not warm at all. It must had been sitting around for quite some time. The server was all over the place. At times we did not see him for 10 min. He would forget to bring us things we asked for, and just kept making us wait more and more. I'm not venting about them in a negative way though! Don't get me wrong! Its amazing that they can run this establishment as smooth as they do with as many people coming through as they do!  I ordered the BBQ Chicken Salad. It came out with not to much wait time. It was fresh, and well made! Tasted wonderful! Made up for all the other set backs... Moral of the story!!! If you enjoy mass amounts of people in a small area! This restaurant location is for you! If you suffer from social anxiety or hate being around tons of people... This might not be the Cheesecake Factory location for you!  Fun environment If I do say so myself! I do enjoy the busy buzz of everyone trying to have a good Saturday night! I love being around tons of people. So I was A OK to be eating among the crowds!!!"
