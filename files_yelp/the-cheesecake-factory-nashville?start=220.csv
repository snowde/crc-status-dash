B L.,"Nashville, TN",0,48,,2.0,8/17/2011,"If you want a 6,000 calorie meal of completely average food - this is your place.  that is, if you can survive the parking lot long enough to get inside."
phil l.,"Murfreesboro, TN",0,11,,1.0,7/21/2012,"They don't do reservations so you just have to wait in line to get a table. But the entryway is not nearly large enough for the crowd, so there's a lot of jostling. Not pleasant.  We made the mistake of ordering the ahi tuna salad, which has tuna lightly seared on the outside, uncooked in the middle. One of our orders was clearly not fresh, and the other for some reason was smothered in red pepper to the point one could not taste the fish. We returned the unfresh one and they brought out a better one, but no apologies or comps. I wouldn't take the chance of ordering raw fish here again.  The bread is good, and the waiter pleasant, although we sat for more than 15 minutes before receiving any attention."
April S.,"Alexandria, VA",0,21,,4.0,4/4/2010,"This place is great. They have the best sashimi tuna appetizer in the world. The fried artichokes are also pretty good.  I love the banana cream cheesecake as well.  I tried stopping by last weekend, but it was too packed! I can see why."
Heather R.,"Nashville, TN",14,257,39,5.0,1/16/2009,"We're not talking your average Cheesecake Factory here. This place is beautiful, it almost makes you feel under-dressed when you walk in and see the high ceilings and marble, marble, marble everywhere.  The menu is so much more than just a few clubs! I always get the Salmon, although the name of the sauce I choose has decided to leave me as I write this. I think you have to go with the 'oriental' preparation  or some such thing. Whatever. It's good.  During the warm months they have the porch open, and it's a great spot to gorge yourself, people watch, and let the sun warm you. You get a have a great meal at this place, and you still get to leave with that Snickers Cheesecake tucked in a bag for when you get home. All Cheesecake Factories should be like this."
Kelsey Y.,"Cookeville, TN",0,2,,5.0,1/11/2014,"The cheesecake at this Cheesecake Factory is WONDERFUL! I can't really vouge for anything else. I've never sat in & ate their food. I've always got my cheesecake to go.  But the service for the  cheesecake to go line is always very quick.  Also, they have a wide variety of choices.  There are so many to choose from! My favorites are the regular Strawberry Cheesecake & the Reece's Cheesecake!  Go with either one of those & you definitely won't be sorry! Everytime I'm at Green Hills I can't resist going by & getting me a piece! (:"
Gabrielle T.,"New York, NY",8,29,2,4.0,1/1/2013,"So a friend suggested that we go to The Cheesecake Factory as my birthday outing dinner choice, and I wasn't disappointed! We did have a short wait (30 minutes), but it was New Year's Eve, so it was to be expected. It's usually a good sign for a restaurant if there is a wait, though, right? Anywho, firstly - this is very ridiculous of me, but also a sign of how easy I am to impress: they serve bread - two kinds in fact! One brown-in-color with grains scattered about here and there, and your run of the mill Italian style loaf. Unfortunately I'm one of those customers that becomes quietly disgruntled if there isn't bread. Sad I know. It's the little things. I'll continue to the juice, the important part if you will.  I did not like how close we sat to other tables...it's the style where there's one seating rail against a wall, and little two-seater tables lined up with about 21/2 feets space between the other man's table on either side, and a on the opposite end of table. I understand this is typical some places, but when you're out for dinner and not at a bar, you generally don't want to hear your neighbors' conversation or vice versa. The server was friendly and accommodating. We never felt rushed, which I strongly appreciate. When I go out to dinner, I despise the feeling of ""okay, you're done - now please leave because we need turnover."" The food: I had the grilled veggie burger accompanied by a salad with vinaigrette dressing as my main entree, ordered from 'The Skinnylicious' menu. While I know it might not sound appealing to a lot - YUM! Very flavorful and delicious. The salad consisted of a fluffy, deceivingly generous portion of rich-in-color mixed greens, with a tomato or two, dowsed in the vinaigrette dressing. I assumed it would taste as one would expect - nothing to write home about, it's lettuce, right? That dressing was amazing! I don't love vinaigrettes, though I'm trying to. But this one was on the mark. Unique and delicious. Oh, and for drink I had the strawberry lemonade, which was seriously addictive. I went through a solid 3 refills without a problem in an embarrassingly short amount of time. Onto the cheesecake: I ordered the tiramisu cheesecake, and my friend ordered the carrot cake cheesecake. The carrot cake cheesecake was okay, however the tiramisu was decadent! So yum! As an added yay!-point, My cheesecake came with a candle in whipped cream, lighted by the server at the table, and ""Happy Birthday!"" written in chocolate sauce around the plate. It's the little things!  In conclusion - beautiful restaurant, great service, delicious food with tables slightly too close for comfort (in my case). I would recommend anyone going here. I will not give it five stars only because I rarely do that with chain restaurants :) It's not their fault, I'm just a foodie."
Avonel R.,"Nashville, TN",59,146,2,3.0,10/19/2010,"This place is fun for going out with friends, but is  too overcrowded and loud for a date night. Be prepared to wait on a Friday and Saturday night. I've waited over an hour before and personally, I don't think this rediculous wait is worth it. This place is most  enjoyable on Sunday for brunch with a mimosa out on the patio."
Kenny H.,"Hermitage, TN",37,68,,3.0,7/6/2011,"I've avoided this place for years because it's a chain, and the exceptionally large menu doesn't sound like a positive to me. But, I was in the mall, and it was right there, and my mom was paying, so I gave it a shot. The food is pretty good, and the place was nicely done, although large. That's about all I have to say. If you have to eat there, you will probably be satisfied. It's nothing amazing."
Matt H.,"Nashville, TN",111,7,38,5.0,8/10/2011,I love the cheesecake factory! It's a very neat place to eat and they have nearly everything you could possibly want on the menu.
Scott W.,"Brentwood, TN",0,8,,2.0,11/26/2013,"Seating was prompt.  Passion fruit tea bitter.  Service spotty.  Bread cold.  Grilled salmon very good.  Not offered either straws or knives.  Blackout cake dry.  Red velvet cheesecake excellent.  Overall, not worth the $125 we dropped on a family dinner.  Won't be back."
Deborah G.,"Portland, OR",19,50,3,2.0,2/27/2011,"Loud, crowded, and as mainstream as it gets. If you *must* eat here, do it for the cheesecake. Don't bother with the voluminous food menu, which features conventional permutations of the usual massmarket American fare."
Erin D.,"Nashville, TN",24,325,60,4.0,1/30/2009,"You can't hate this place. I don't love it, but you can't hate it. I've never been here though when I didn't have to wait in line for a minimum of 15 minutes. I'm talking about all times of day too - lunch, dinner, weekend off hours. It's always busy. The bar is never empty either.  I've had hit or miss with service at this location too. The ones in Austin and Atlanta have always been great. Although it's mostly been good. The food is standard, and huge portions, but usually tasty.  If you like overpriced cheesecake that comes in a lot of flavors this is also your place."
Darrell B.,"Murfreesboro, TN",4,41,,4.0,9/20/2007,"The only Cheesecake Factory in Tennessee from this nationally favorite restaurant chain. It is located at The Mall at Green Hills, Nashville's only higher end luxury mall.  I have ate here over fifty times probably so definitely have experienced the variety it has to offer.  The most stunning thing about this restaurant next to the variety and portion of food is the atmosphere. Even compared to some other Cheesecake Factorys it is gorgeous in size. An blue tower with glittering lights that look like stars adorns the high double doored entryway. High windows, and high ceilings that stretch two or three stories. Beautiful art, marble, huge mirrors, and windows.  The vastness and beauty makes it feel as if you are dining in some kind of exotic palace. The menu is a small book! They offer the huge variety of dishes with very large portions, if you have ever ate at a Cheesecake Factory before you will recognize the dishes. If not then you will have to eat there to understand the variety!  The food for me is great. For such a large restaurant the food tastes as if a lot of attention was paid to detail, and I almost have always had great food eating there. I have developed a liking to three or four particular dishes.  I love the Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp, which is a great Caribbean dish for a chain restaurant. The Chicken Madeira is a huge favorite among mostly everyone who dines there, and has a very unique taste. If you like sushi or don't mind trying raw tuna, I highly recommend their Ahi Carpaccio which is a thin slice of raw Ahi tuna. It actually tastes very good even those who did not like sushi that I got to try it liked it quiet a bit.  The service itself is so-so here. They are usually very busy so are not able to pay a lot of personal attention. We really liked a few of the waiters who seemed very friendly, but several have left or were not there when we were. The hostesses are generally very accommodating and friendly though, and even if you miss a page they will allow you to sit immediately sometimes. The only real negative about the place is the wait on the weekends and some busy weekday evenings. It can be 1 to 2 hours or even more on their busiest weekends so just be aware! You can walk around the mall with the waiting pager and I have found it goes off even in Macy's. The mall closes at 9 though. This is also a great place to eat on the weekends since they close fairly late, I believe 12:30 on Saturday nights!"
Sarah S.,"Nashville, TN",0,22,,1.0,11/4/2009,"I have had many dinners and lunches here, none of which have blown me away...just kind of been so-so.  I tried to eat dinner here this past weekend after catching a movie and the wait was not bad-30 minutes and we were seated in 15.  The problem came when we were seated.   There were two of us and we were seated a TINY table on top of two other tables (there was absolutely no way we could have had 2 entrees, 2 glass of water and 2 glases of wine on the table at once).  We could not even hear each other speak we were so close to the other tables.  Our table also had a large chunk of it missing from the corner which was sharp and the table itself was incredibly wobbly.  We asked our server if we could move, she politely brought us back to the front where we were told we would have to wait again, despite seeing multiple tables being cleaned and empty as we walked from the back to the front.  In the end, we decided that we were not going to wait again so we left. I do not understand how people wait for hours to eat at this place...the food is nothing special and service has never been exceptional either."
Josh R.,"Nashville, TN",0,14,,4.0,4/5/2008,"8000 decent options.  7000 include grilled chicken. Girlfriend and I went for drinks after a movie tonight.  Thank you cheesecake, for frosting my beer mugs and giving me a deliciously cold beer.   Appetizers: The corn tamale cakes and the avocado rolls are amazing.  Perhaps not $20 amazing, but still pretty good. All said and done, Cheesecake has lots of good options, lots of good deserts, but it just slight to pricey to justify it all.  Oh, and did I mention you might have to wait for eternity to get a seat?"
T. C.,"Sacramento, CA",37,165,61,5.0,4/22/2008,"I know it's a chain.  I know it's not even cool to give a chain restaurant five stars.  But I must.  Because I love their ginormous portions.  And their wildly overpriced but yummy fruity cocktails.  And their BBQ Ranch Chicken Salad rocks my world.  And of course (of COURSE) their cheesecake. Downsides to this particular Cheesecake Factory?  It's still a relative novelty in Tennessee so the wait is RIDONKULOUS.  Be prepared to wait.  And if you can't wait, check out Carraba's just down the way at the end of the mall (by the bank)."
Kevin M.,"Mt Juliet, TN",1,23,2,2.0,1/2/2011,"The wait at this particular one is horrific, and the waiters are slow as molasses."
Kj B.,"League City, TX",0,1,,2.0,3/22/2013,"Our server Jamie was not good! She waited 30 minutes before serving our bread! Then to add insult to injury, she gave bread to the lady at the next table, that sat down after we did. She never offered more bread! I've had the pleasure of eating at several Cheesecake Factories in many states never had a server this bad!  The positive part was the food was good."
