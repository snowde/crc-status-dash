Anonymous P.,"Los Angeles, CA",9,38,,2.0,2/25/2010,"Sometimes, instead of trying out the local grub scene, one goes to a chain restaurant to look for some consistency.  That's why tourists go to McDonald's in England, because English food sucks, and you can always rely on a Big Mac to taste like a Big Mac no matter what you think of a Big Mac. Ergo, the Cheesecake Factory.  A restaurant chain, where in theory, no matter where you are, every restaurant should look the same, and the food should taste the same.  The Cheesecake Factory in Green Hills was just nasty.  Nasty service, nasty food...damn, how can you mess up on Vietnamese Spring Rolls?   Our main courses sucked mega balls too.  Worst yet everything came out on time except for one plate - which came 15 minutes later - which meant that the rest of us waited for the final plate to come out - which meant our meals were cold by the time we started eating. The thing is, the people who work there walk around like ""We're Cheesecake.  We're the shit.  Our food is awesome."" When in reality, yes, it is the Cheesecake Factory, but the only thing that is shit is the quality of the food.   Now where's that Big Mac?"
Kate C.,"Antioch, TN",57,5,2,1.0,11/18/2012,"A group of 10 of us decided to celebrate a friend's birthday at this restaurant. We chose valet parking. We arrived at 6:30 PM, fully aware that there would be a hefty wait, but we were willing because everyone loves the Cheesecake Factory experience. We were told there would be a 2.5 hr wait and shortly after we were told it was dropped down to 1.5 hr. About every 30 min we would check in to see what the wait was and we were constantly told ""About 20 min"". We were finally seated at 9 PM. It took approximately 15 min for water to be served and bread to be brought to our table. Everyone ordered a round of drinks and it took another 20 minutes for those to arrive. When my friend asked if there were gluten free options, our waitress, Dawn, told her that she couldn't guarantee anything and she would be taking a gamble with anything she ordered. My friend, who rarely comes out because of anxiety, was treated with an incredible amount of disrespect and left her irritated and stressed about dinner the rest of the night. At this point, I went and talked to the manager to let him know what the waitress said. As we ordered our dinner, we also ordered a second round of drinks. Menus were never taken away from our table and appetizer dishes were stacked high before they were cleared away. Dinner came, we all finished our food and plates were cleared away before our drinks even arrived. At that point, no one cared to have another drink, but since the drinks are priced so high we didn't have a choice. I left the table again to talk to a different manager, Travis. I told him about our experience and how we were extremely disappointed with our service. I let him know that we were all willing to wait the long amount of time because we all love this restaurant but the experience once we sat down was completely unacceptable. He apologized and was very gracious. He offered to buy everyone's dessert and also was going to take off the auto 18% tip. When we asked for dessert menus, 1 was brought to us for a table of 10. Another 20 minutes went by before we were able to order. Our dessert came out one by one, making the night even slower. Had our waitress been bringing us our bills at that point we would have been able to speed the process up. Instead we had to track her down. She was tipped poorly by everyone. By the time we left the restaurant it was 11:35 PM. The valet service closed at 9:30 PM. We were the only car left and the employee had to wait only for us. Our plans to go out after dinner for my friends birthday were ruined because we spent over 5 hours at dinner for what was the absolute worst dining experience myself and the others in the group have ever had ANYWHERE. We chose The Cheesecake Factory because we have all been avid fans of it for over 10 years. This experience was unacceptable and the chance of me dining at that location is very slim."
Nashville T.,"Nashville, TN",0,11,,4.0,6/29/2014,great place to eat but kind of expensive
David O.,"Nashville, TN",61,937,861,4.0,8/17/2009,"I like to take my parents there when they come from out of town. I can't disagree with any of the previous reviewers. The wait is long if you come during dinner, but the food has always been delicious with very  generous portions.  It is also very loud, so if you are looking for some place quiet and intimate to go on a date, this isn't the place. But the food is good, and the cheesecake is delicious."
Anna A.,"Nashville, TN",183,251,3,3.0,12/23/2008,"Overrated!! if I only had one word to describe the cheesecake factory that would be it. I am giving them three stars because I had a most fine mojito here once. I also will say that I find their appetizers to be pretty good for the most part but pricey for what they are. The cheesecake is also most excellent but not cooked on sight people. I saw the freezer truck arrive one morning. I think this is what did me in... How can you be a cheesecake factory if you don't make your own cheesecake? Aren't you just the cheesecake counter then? I guess what else could you expect out of a chain eh? Forget the entrees, they are not that good and way to pricey. The salads are decent but you guessed it pricey..."
Dietrich D.,"Little Rock, AR",25,60,34,4.0,1/19/2010,"Good food, its a chain, so its consistent.  but nonetheless, its good.  service was ok, a little 'out there' but attentive and kept up with our refills without asking....and several in our party drink pretty quick."
Sissy D.,"Hopkinsville, KY",9,112,28,3.0,7/2/2009,"Its different. Large menu, super big portions....(be prepared to be embarrassed if you get the grande burrito...its a giant larva!) they have some really good dishes/some not. You can eat off the lunch menu (lasts till 5 pm) and get somewhat smaller portions, and cheaper prices. Cheesecake is good even though they don't make it. One down side to this restaurant is all the pretentious people who eat there. Sorta like middle class trying to act Hollywood. Get over yourself......I too can afford a $60.00 meal. Wait staff is either, super nice excellent service, or you get some bitchy girl with mounds of attitude. I say try it, its fun......kids love it. But seriously, you will need to inspect your silverware, I too have had to ask for new silverware because of some ""gerb"" stuck on my fork......ewww."
Tim A.,"Nashville, TN",17,17,15,4.0,6/27/2010,The Cheesecake Factory has something for everyone. Hard to go wrong here. Be prepared to wait a while if you come during peak hours.
Taylor T.,"Nashville, TN",253,26,5,4.0,12/11/2011,"I've always loved Cheesecake Factory. I'm a sucker for their Caramel Chicken dish (it's huge, so I'd suggest eating half and taking half home) and am always tempted to get a slice of cheesecake after my meal (but I'm usually too full from the huge meal). Their brown bread that they serve before your meal comes is absolutely fantastically delicious (especially if it's nice and warm). My family and I went there last night and it was PACKED. They said it was a two-hour wait, so we watched the bar area like a hawk until a table opened up (didn't want to wait two hours, and bar seating allows you to grab a table once someone is finished--just be diligent about it). We got a fantastic server, who happily complied with our specific requests (only brown bread, please!) and at the end of our meal, he gave us a whole loaf of brown bread to take home. Now THAT'S customer service!! We left happy, satisfied, and quite full. Also, right now they have a deal going on: for every $25 you spend on gift cards, you get a coupon for a free slice of Cheesecake. Just thought I'd put that out there (:"
Rahel K.,"Nashville, TN",115,191,7,4.0,7/28/2008,I know!!!  Another chain review!  But I grabbed some appetizers here last night before a movie at Green Hills Mall.  It's a little expensive but service is great and you can grab a table/seat at the bar so you don't have to stand in line in the waiting room.  had the lettuce wraps and won-tons - tasty!!
Tera M.,"Monterey, CA",92,228,,3.0,4/17/2009,"I came here with my mom and sister and the new little one. The weather was nice and they had outdoor seating so we sat outside. I've never eaten at a Cheesecake Factory and I can't say I'm in any particular rush to go back. I was impressed by the huge selection. If you can't find something on the menu to appease then maybe eating out isn't your thing. My sister ordered a dish that she likes and my mom got some breaded chicken thing with lots of pasta and some veggies. I ordered a pasta dish that i thought would have an asian flare to it. It had the shitake mushrooms, asparagus and a few tomatoes. There was supposed to be shrimp, there were four. It had a slight alfredo sauce thing going on and there was a huge pile of pasta. I picked out the good stuff and left the rest. I was still hungry but , at least for once, I had room for dessert. Cheesecake. can't remember which one."
Tripp W.,"Nashville, TN",0,1,,1.0,4/17/2011,This place consistently has the worst service and the most bland food.  Their menu has advertisements in it--enough said.
Sara T.,"Nashville, TN",0,7,,2.0,4/10/2009,"I usually steer clear of chains, but decided to come here because it was a good mutual meeting place for a friend and I. It was empty, around 4:30pm, with quite a few staff standing around looking for stuff to do. We came for apps and drinks, so I couldn't vouch for the rest of the menu.  Now, I set my expectations pretty low for this place, so I can't really say I was disappointed by much. But, I was a little suprised by how greasy everything was.  We sat in the bar and got the cuban sandwiches, the avocado eggrolls, the chicken quesadillas and drinks. My friend seemed to enjoy her mojito, and I had a beer.   The cuban sandwiches were suprisingly tasty (or maybe I was just hungry,) but the buns were slathered w/ grease or butter or something. I enjoyed them, but they kind of sat like a rock in my gut.  The avocado eggrolls were SUPER heavy. Obviously, the eggroll wrapper was fried, but I expected that, being an eggroll.  But, what I didn't expect was that the filling was pretty much ALL avocado.  Now, I LOVE avocado, but the menu says that there is sun dried tomatoes, cilantro, and onion in the eggroll, so I was expecting more of a veggie mix.  I didn't taste anything other than avocado in the filling. And it was just TOO rich and fatty with the fried shell. But, the tamarind dip was kind of good, and interesting w/ the avocado. I didn't expect much from the quesadillas (they are all the same, to me) so I will reserve harsh judgement. But, again, the outer tortillas were super greasy and seemed to be fried in an excess of oil.  Why not bake a quesadilla?? The staff was SUPER attentive (almost too much so,) and super UNprofessional.  Some guy came over to our table (after we had already had 2 other servers come by,) and just kind of hung out, talking about random crap. It was weird. After we got our apps and were enjoying our drinks, some other guy came by and grabbed our app plate while we were still eating it. I stopped him from taking it (which TOTALLY put me in an uncomfortable and embarrassing situation!) Then, the second the food was off the plates (I was still holding part of an eggroll,) he came by and took the plates again!!! I let him take it that time, and used my napkin as a plate.  The food wasn't really bad, it was just really cheap and greasy tasting. Not fresh. Kinda like dive bar food. The seating was uncomforable in the bar... super high stools with your back open to a lot of open space.  I may be back because of the covenience of the location (for drinks only,) but not for food.... Just too greasy for my taste. And the servers are nice, but inexperienced and unprofessional."
Tyler J.,"White House, TN",0,15,,3.0,12/13/2009,Expensive and always crowded but great drinks coffee and dessert!!! The pasta I had was a large portion and tasted excellent.
Nick N.,"Chattanooga, TN",13,86,9,3.0,3/20/2010,"We went here for the first time the other night and I already knew it was a popular place as I had had many people say how much they loved the food so I wanted to check it out...neither the food nor the service disappointed as both were very good. Even though there were lots of people waiting to be seated we were able to be seated almost right away due to the fact that there were only two of us and the others waiting were groups of 8 plus. Our server greeted us as we were seated, drinks and bread arrived promptly thereafter and the appetizer we ordered came in just a few minutes. As some others have said the portion sizes are huge, they really are! The appetizer was enough for dinner alone. The main dishes we ordered were great and again the portions were huge. We only finished half took the rest too go along with dessert which was delicious too. They have a wide selection on the menu so almost everyone is sure to find something they could like and of course as the name implies they have a great selection of delicious cheesecakes! Now my only complaint for the about the place is the seating and this kept me from rating it any higher. You are packed in with very little room so if you don't mind being two feet away it is all good.  It seemed very loud too but this again could be due to the close proximity of others too!"
L P.,"Fort Smith, AR",16,68,16,4.0,9/4/2009,"The many times I'm in Nashville, I always stop by for a slice cheesecake with strawberries before I head home. One time, I ordered the lemon pepper chicken for lunch and it was enough for two to eat. Portions are huge for a reasonable price. Their strawberry lemonade is the best."
Angelo G.,"Nashville, TN",0,14,,3.0,4/2/2010,"There really isn't anything good about this place except the cheesecake.  The service is okay as is the rest of the food.  If you're going to eat here, order out to avoid the twenty minute wait."
Paul M.,"Harpswell, ME",0,209,,5.0,5/15/2008,"Popular with locals.  We were traveling through, stumbled on The Cheesecake Restaurant by accident just intending to buy a cheesecake! The building and the ambience are unique and amazing.  Extensive and imaginative menu 18 pages long, 9 pages food, the rest drinks and advertising.  Service is good, excellent food is well presented.  Recorded background piano music sounds real.  Prices are modest.  Full bar.  We would go there again."
