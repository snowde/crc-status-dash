Jeremiah M.,"Mayfield, KY",1,7,,1.0,8/28/2017,"I give it 1 star for the food. I like the dishes here based on portion to price and taste. This chain seriously needs a hostess training overhaul.  No matter the location, the cheesecake factory hostesses are straight up unprofessional and rude.  It's like having to go through hell just to be seated and get the great food that I love to eat. One exception, Houston TX at the galleria, that hostess rocks, but any other locations I've visted: Seattle, Chicago, Nashville,  the hostesses act like they're possessed by the devil. FACT! At this location we waited 1 hr and 20 mins. I was told it would be 40mins by the rude hostess. As we waited we watched guests enter and be seated before us. I asked could we sit in the bar first come first serve, the hostess looked over at the bar area and said "" only the bar stools or high tops, not the booths or tables and good luck finding one"" though hellish rude, she was right as there were 3 high tops vacant but were cover with dishes and were dirty. They stayed that way much of the time we waited. After 1hr 20 mins my friend went up and asked why others were being seated before us, the hostess rolled her eyes and whispered to another hostess something and we were told to wait at the hostess station. At this time our buzzer went off and we were seated another 5 mins from then. Our server greeted us and informed us that this was ""like my 5th shift, so bare with me"" . He was slow and unprofessional in serving us, he seemed to be frustrated the entire time. He didn't know the ingredients in the dishes nor did he check to find out. I informed him of my allergy to onions, he just strugged his shoulders. I went on Facebook to the cheesecake factory page and posted a comment.  I noticed that the chain didn't comment on any of the complaints just the compliments. So cheesecake factory could care less if I eat there again, so I wont. The Macaroni Grill in opry mills mall is where I'll go.  I love being treated like a human being and Macaroni Grill has done just that all 4 times I've visited no matter the location.  It's a shame that not all restaurants like their guests because each one has different cuisine to experience.  But it's not very smart to spend $60 to be treated poorly when there's a Macaroni Grill that will love for me to visit their restaurant and to serve me."
Kim R.,"Antioch, Nashville, TN",344,20,1,2.0,2/5/2017,"If I have TWO things to describe the Cheesecake Factory it would be "" Over Rated&Over Priced ""! They don't make their own Cheesecake , so not sure why they consider/ call themselves a factory . As far as the taste ... not bad ! However the slices are tiny considering what you pay.... ijs . Do yourself a favor and go elsewhere!"
Camilla J.,"Lebanon, TN",76,160,759,2.0,5/23/2016,"Shopping at Green Hills usually means a lot of bags... I had just left the restaurant and by the time I reached Godiva I realized I was missing one.  I went straight back, maximum 5 mins later, my sweet waiter was happy to tell me and my daughter he found the bag and that he had brought it to the hostess up front. Well... The hostess looked confused and looked around and opened a cabinet door and then said she couldn't find it, she would have to speak to the manager. The manager showed up after 10 mins and said he would have to investigate what had happened and call me back. I told him that my waiter found the bag and I had return just five minutes after realizing it was gone, what could have happened? He reminded me they were not responsible for any bags left behind... 40 mins later he calls me and says that apperantly the hostess had given my bag to someone else. I understand NO restaurant is ever responsible for the stuff you leave behind, I do however think some care more than others. If you come here, hold on to your stuff..."
Samantha G.,"Nacogdoches, TX",126,10,5,3.0,7/6/2016,"I went to out to eat here with my family around 9pm, 7/3. Surprisingly, it wasn't busy at all and from what I could see they had pretty good coverage waiter wise and a numerous number of tables though. When we walked in to be seated we were asked to wait 15 minutes so they can clean off tables. ....Ok, I guess but I noticed plenty of clean open tables in a wide variety of areas that looked to be covered by a waiter. First deduction.  When we were finally seated, our waiter came about 20 minutes after and greeted us and asked for our drinks. I didn't bother to remember his name because I was already pretty irked - but luckily I was pretty hungry so we didn't leave.  (Note: I've been to multiple cheesecake factories, and they've all exceeded expectations - food and service wise.) After what seemed like forever, our waiter took our orders and I picked the Crusted Chicken Romano. When we got our food, my pasta was hard. Like a bit before al dente. Still a bit flexible to the touch but a bit stiff nonetheless. The chicken was flavorless aside from the bits of cheese I could taste but it honestly just tasted like plain panko break crumbs. Overall, awful choice and I'm not going to be picking that meal at future locations.  In it's entirety, I could understand the poor service if it was a busy night. But, it wasn't. It looked just about dead by the time we left. Love the cheesecake factory, but I highly dislike this location."
Ande C.,"Las Vegas, NV",434,22,1,1.0,3/5/2017,Completely RUDE customer service for absolutely no reason. I am amazed they actually have 3 stars. All we got was a pickup order and a lot od attitude! Wow!  I will go to the one in Cool Springs instead.
Phil T.,"Nashville, TN",0,31,,2.0,1/6/2017,"Average food, average service, extremely high prices, large and diverse menu. The only reason I really go here is if I'm in a large group with different dietary needs. Otherwise I think Cheesecake Factory is one of the most overrated restaurants out there."
Angie K.,"Bowling Green, KY",17,12,22,4.0,9/11/2016,Everything and I mean everything is so delicious. From the Firecracker salmon to the MacnCheese hamburger. And the best for last...Cheesecake!!! I always end up getting a piece to go because I'm too full but it makes a great breakfast the next day!
Christina L.,"Hopkinsville, KY",22,126,22,4.0,3/9/2017,I really like this place the cheesecake's are absolutely delicious!!  The food on the menu is very good also but some of it overpriced. The service was good also. I would recommend this place.
Nicole M.,"Tampa, FL",48,18,28,2.0,12/23/2016,The cheese cake may be good but the service at the to go is super slow. I was not even acknowledged for 10 minutes. It took almost 15 minutes to get two slices of cheese cake and 5 people including the person before me have been long gone for 5-10 minutes now. Wonder if it would have been faster if I had called ahead.  Call ahead if you are walking the mall or making an impromptu stop  not worth standing around with your kids to wait.
Susan R.,"Mooresville, NC",0,13,,1.0,7/29/2017,"Do yourself a favor, order their high-calorie meal and skip their salads. Unless you love the flavor of pesticides on your salad.  We ordered California salad and it tasted like chemicals. I understand that it is a chain restaurant so I should not expect organic salad but for anything so healthy and simple to taste so bitter was beyond my understanding. Nothing, and I mean nothing was probably washed before bring it out, looking nice is a bowl.  And for some reason they also served cold hard bread? In my understanding, the bread usually comes out warm, at least in our Charlotte, Nc and all Ohio locations. We nicely asked out server, who gladly replaced it but again with a hard cold one.  Never-mind the bread, but the salad was a deal breaker. How can something so simple that requires no cooking can taste so horrible and full of chemicals?  The lady manager came and made no apologies. I don't care if the respond on yelp and try to act nice.  Please stay away from CF. everything is frozen and re-heated and this place is OVERRATED. It's all about how quick the food goes out from the kitchen, once the order is placed. Stick to ethnic restaurants in Nashville for good food."
Amy Z.,"Gallatin, TN",0,11,,5.0,12/6/2016,"Let me start by saying I love the Cheesecake Factory !!! I've been here regularly. I usually get the orange chicken. Went here tonight and ordered the Orange chicken. Beware !!! They say they have ""changed"" the chicken. I got a plate of what looked like dumplings !!!!  The chicken tasted like dough. Terrible. Plus I think the Orange sauce was spoiled. After waiting thirty minutes for food my husband ate his and was almost finished by the time our waiter ask if I wanted to send it back and order something different. By that time I just said no. They took it off my order but it was still fifty bucks for my husbands and a cheesecake he was supposed to give us since I had nothing but bread !!!! No manager came over to apologize or do anything except basically take my food back and send me out the door hungry. Poor customer service !!! Very disappointed tonight. Frankly probably will choose Another place next time.  In update..... gave this place another chance with the family and I have to say they have redeemed themselves with me.  Food was so great !!! Service excellent !!! Orange chicken the best ever !!!"
Robert P.,"Evansville, IN",26,5,,4.0,4/2/2017,Great food great service. Peter was there when we needed him and didn't bug us. The chicken Parmesan sandwich was great and the low carb cheesecake was good as well.
Jamie K.,"Nashville, TN",176,33,21,4.0,1/16/2017,I have always loved this place! Decided to try a honey bourbon drink and it was fabulous!! I was a little shocked with the martini glass but it ended up being a great touch with the drink. I ate the Louisiana chicken and loved it!! Can't wait to go back. Godiva cheesecake is to die for. The service was okay but the food was awesome
Heather D.,"Columbus, OH",57,156,371,4.0,6/28/2014,"On the way back home from the only real vacation we'll take this year. My man just had a birthday and he got a gift card for Cheesecake Factory...Yea!! We would have had to wait for about 15-20 minutes for a table so we sat at the bar to take advantage of the happy hour appetizers. We got the Chicken Pot Stickers. Lots of chicken in them, lightly crunchy on one side and soft and chewy on the other. Awesome. I ordered the Steak Diane and Chicken Madeira. Got the steak medium, it was perfect nice and juicy. The Madeira was stated to be their most popular chicken dish, it was very good. Although I still like the chicken marsala better.  My man got the California cheese steak sandwich with fries. He was very satisfied with the sandwich and the fries.  Both dishes were a nice size. I couldn't finish mine and neither could my man. We both took some home."
Angie H.,"Horn Lake, MS",0,2,,3.0,2/12/2017,I was at this location to purchase 1 slice of cheese cake and it took 25- 30 mins to get one slice!! The cheese cake I purchase was the red velvet and it was nice but the wait is a little on the ridiculous side
Timothy B.,"Saint Louis, MO",17,114,102,1.0,5/16/2016,"One of the worst experiences I've had in a restaurant in 15 years. I was seated immediately by my server, she took my drink order and disappeared for 5 minutes. When she came back she had my Arnold Palmer and took my dinner order, their hibachi steak and a side Caesar salad.  The side salad came out quickly but the steak took close to 20 minutes and when it showed up it was cold as were the mashed potatoes and tempura asparagus. I got a manager's attention and was told it would be replaced quickly another 20 minutes later still no steak. I went to the hostess stand and they got the same manager again who said they were about to bring the new dinner out I told her no thank you and how bad this experience was. This was at 9pm at night with a less than half full restaurant."
Janette C.,"McKenzie, TN",0,2,,2.0,7/18/2017,"Beware their bait and switch performance when you order a nearly $9.00 slice of cheesecake at the counter.  Large, delicious-looking cheesecakes with generous slices, already cut.  When you order, they get your slice somewhere in the back, not from the cheesecakes you are looking at in the case.  The slice they give you is 1/4 the size of the slices in the case.  For nearly $9.00 a slice.  Never again."
Stephanie M.,"McMinnville, TN",0,9,11,5.0,7/3/2017,Very very crowded!  Suprising though that we only had a 20 minute wait for table for 5. The service was good and so was the food. Love the atomaspher in the room. I had the Pasta Da Vinci; very tasty and filling. I will return next time in area.
Pregnant L.,"Downtown, Nashville, TN",122,15,,5.0,6/28/2017,"With all these new restaurants popping up in Nashville .. sometimes we forget about the old faithful classics. We had delicious chicken sliders , calamari , miso salmon , salad,chicken Alfredo, and can't forget about the complimentary wheat bread! Also great customer service. We will be back again:)"
Eboni S.,"Hermitage, TN",5,34,11,3.0,3/7/2016,"I've never cared for the Cheesecake Factory. I can remember in the past that the menu was not impressive. My most recent visit was a little better. The menu had so much more to choose from. I ordered the herb crusted salmon with mashed potatoes and broccoli. I'll give the meal a 7. The salmon was bland whoever the herb crust made up for it. It's something about this place that I don't care for however no one I was with complained about their food, so it's safe to assume they have good food."
