Sara S.,"Pensacola, FL",27,12,,3.0,11/5/2016,Food was good. Service left a lot t to be desired. Couldn't seem to understand to bring the salads first. We had he white chicken chili and was delicious.
Brandon P.,"Bowling Green, KY",6,90,40,5.0,6/5/2015,"I really enjoy this restaurant when I visit Nashville. The menu is HUGE, so it might take a while to determine what you want to eat. It's an awesome meal, whatever you get. Always try something new!!! Keep in mind that if you want cheesecake, take home some of your food...as the portions are massive. The cheesecakes are to die for...but what would you expect? It is a little expensive, but if you go at lunch, they do have lunch portions for most of their dishes. You also get bread with your meal. It's a great place to take a date!! I highly recommend this restaurant."
Lynne P.,"Nashville, TN",16,77,13,5.0,1/26/2016,"Yep, this was a 5 star experience!!  It hasn't always been, but this particular night it was great!  The place was empty due to very bad weather (snow, ice, etc. but we could walk there).  We were seated instantly and our server really helped out with menu questions. We ordered from the Skinnylicious Menu and I got the Grilled Steak Medallions (Certified Angus Beef® Served with Fresh Asparagus, Shiitake Mushrooms, Sauteed Cherry Tomatoes, Crushed Croutons, Mashed Potatoes and Madeira Wine Sauce). My husband got a tossed green salad (with divine Bleu Cheese dressing!) and the Skinnylicious® Chicken Enchiladas (Covered with Our Red Chile Sauce and Melted Cheese. Served with Escabeche Vegetable Salad). He really liked the salad (it was HUGE) and his enchiladas.  He let the Escabeche veggies go--just didn't appeal to him.  I ADORED my steak medallions.  They were cooked to perfection, and were an excellent match to the asparagus, mushrooms, tomatoes. The meat sat in a bed of heavenly mashed potatoes and it was all smothered in the Madeira Wine sauce...all for under 600 calories and it tasted like a million!!!  I only ate half (the portions were that big!) and was able to enjoy the meal for another sitting! We both ordered cheesecake to go.  I have an affinity for their Peppermint Bark Cheesecake (White chocolate cheesecake swirled with chunks of chocolate peppermint bark, topped with white chocolate mousse and finished with chopped peppermint) but it's only available during the holiday season.  When I found out that there was some in the case, I was ecstatic!  When I found out that was the LAST of the Peppermint Bark Cheesecakes that they had, I grabbed up two slices (and I think finished off that last cake!)!! I ate it later and it did not fail to delight!  AWESOMENESS!!!  My hubby got some kind of chocolate on top of chocolate on top of chocolate selection and was a happy camper. I think this was the best meal I've had there...ever...and I think I'll order the same thing next time we're there!"
Kimmy N.,"Saint Louis, MO",55,386,1522,4.0,4/15/2015,I've been to the green hill location in Nashville a few times before! I love that it's inside one of the best malls in Tennessee! They have excellent food here! Never encountered anything bad. Downfall for this location that it's a lot smaller than your average Cheesecake Factory. I think they should expand because  on weekends I'm sure waiting is forever!
Em F.,"Lafayette, IN",2,20,2,4.0,3/30/2016,"It's Cheesecake Factory, what more could you ask for? Parking is hard most nights. Don't be afraid to walk!   The food here is always good.  Extra large portions and more than enough options to choose from.  Food is always fresh and comes out in a pretty timely fashion considering this location is pretty much ways busy.   Customer service is subpar sometimes, but you can tell the skill in their servers varies pretty widely.   If you get a server who can handle the business volume, the experience is usually perfection.  Sometimes you will get servers who are overstaffed or unused to such a busy place, but they make up for it with their kindness. Sometimes you'll be greeted by some ladies with attitude up front, but that happens infrequently. Drinks are crazy expensive here, so I definitely suggest doing your drinking elsewhere.  The Buffalo Blasts and crab dip are totally to die for.  As well as the caramel cheesecake and the Reeses cheesecake.  We usually only dine on appetizers and cheesecake.  The portions are so large here you'd hardly need to order an entree. 4/5 because it can get loud and the service is spotty.  Great food."
Yoshimi K.,"La Vergne, TN",2,17,5,4.0,4/13/2016,"It was my first time eating here and I was really excited. I ordered pasta that was over $20. When it came out, it had a really weird smell to it but it wasn't bad. The tiramisu cake really caught my attention. It was really good, flavorful and was probably the highlight of the entire meal"
Bethany N.,"Athens, AL",0,9,8,4.0,10/4/2016,"We had a fabulous lunch here today! We loved the location, the fresh breads, and our entrees. We also got cheesecake to go, but we haven't had it yet.  I had the Chicken  Madeira and my partner had the Spicy Chicken Pasta."
Rebecca C.,"Murfreesboro, TN",4,5,1,5.0,4/21/2017,"Our server Raquel was amazing. She was very attentive to our needs and her attitude was very chipper.  The food was hot and good. It was cooked as requested and delivered in a timely manner. I highly recommend the Green Hills location.  We had a piece of Banana Cream cheesecake and it was ""the best I have ever had and that is to include  New York. """
Jeff O.,"Franklin, TN",82,91,30,4.0,8/19/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory is always a great place to go to.  We arrived on a Friday evening and were seated within about 15 minutes, which was great for roughly a 6p arrival.  We got a booth by the windows, for the first time, so we had a slightly different perspective than other locations in the restaurant.  The menu had changed a bit so it took me a while to work through the menu to see what had changed.  The food is always good.  The service was good, and we always love the tropical tea.  Of course, we did not leave without a piece of cheesecake, primarily because my wife loves cheesecake.  I'm not into it as much, but I help my wife along.  :D"
Monica M.,"Nashville, TN",1,16,3,3.0,4/13/2016,"Excellent customer service. Every server has been extremely amazing. The food is always well cooked and brought out correctly.  I did order the shrimp scampi once, and it was really salty. I complained to the server and he brought his manager. They were extremely kind and offered to make a fresh plate for me. Unfortunately I was in a hurry and did not have time to wait, but they brought out extra tomatoes to help reduce the salty flavor.  The reason I rated The Cheesecake Factory 3 stars is because I absolutely hate how often they change their menu. They ALWAYS get rid of their best plates. The fettuccine Alfredo with Sundried tomatoes is the best dish I have ever had in my life. As a regular to the restaurant, I was devastated when they removed the plate from the menu. They also just recently, removed the Chicken Scampi, and again I was extremely disappointed. I hope they bring these dishes back."
Joyce N.,"Chattanooga, TN",18,61,116,4.0,10/25/2015,Always love Cheesecake Factory! Found this one in Green Hills mall outside downtown Nashville! Very easy to get to from 1-65. Usually a long wait but we were very fortunate and were seated in less than 25 minutes. Unfortunately my husband wasn't as pleased as they were out of the meal he had requested which but him at a disappointed level of expectation. I had the chicken Madeira!!!! Wonderful! Can we talk about dessert?? I ordered the 30th anniversary chocolate cheesecake and my husband had the strawberry cheesecake!! Wonderful! Beautifully decorated and large restaurant. With great friendly servers!
Maria G.,"Grand Junction, CO",2,24,,5.0,3/24/2017,"If you are hungry and want a great meal, come here!! Talbert was a great waiter!  He was funny and gave us exceptional service!  He knew the menu back and forth and had great recommendations!  Ask for him when you come here and he will provide you with excellent service!!"
Nahyun K.,"Clarksville, TN",94,55,168,3.0,8/13/2014,"I give it 3 stars for 3 specific reasons. 1. This restaurant would get 4 stars if it was not for the last time I went. The steak was asked to be cooked medium but it was cooked well done. (The steak Diane was recommended by our waitress who was actually amazing and reminded me of Piper for O is the new B) The chicken was too dry and the mashed potatoes didn't taste fresh. Also, the Cajun Jumbalaya Pasta I always order was dry and lacked sauce.  2. I understand it is a chain restaurant and it's busy during dinner time but do I have to wait 20 minutes for the waitress to come go my table after the hostess sat us? We went through 3 different waitresses until we finally were able to order our food!  3. We paid $13 for 3 small spring rolls as an appetizer. The portions are ridiculously small for the price. Their dinner entrees are a generous amount but again, my food came out unappetizing. If you choose an appetizer, their fried calamari is bomb!  However, their cheesecake is to die for. It is hands down the best cheesecake I have ever put in my mouth! If you go here to try it out, I recommend going during lunch time or before the dinner rush. Don't be alarmed with the bad reviews but do take caution and the worst that could happen is you getting a over cooked steak or dry pasta! Lastly, I have been to so many Cheesecake factories at different locations and I think everyone should try it at least once in their lifetime!"
Anthony B.,"Coatesville, PA",0,2,,5.0,8/21/2016,"If you go, ask for Chrisophe C. He was wonderful! Delivered requests for more drinks, bread, boxes, etc right away. There was great service, great drinks, and exceptional food. They were also pretty quick at preparing and delivering drinks and food."
Carole C.,"Hayes Valley, San Francisco, CA",138,10,1,2.0,8/7/2016,"I understand the place is busy during the weekends, but when you're in line to just order a single cheesecake slice and have 4 customers in front of you, it doesn't take 45 minutes to have the order ready! Also one of the managers needed to do some receipt audit and just scooted in front of my friend and I without addressing us, and the open cashier besides the cashier he was talking to saw us and just stood there without assisting us for a lengthy time. Most of the staff seems like their minds are off somewhere else than working there. Most cheesecake factories are better with customer service on the ready to order counter."
Batsell S.,"La Vergne, TN",57,41,1,1.0,10/11/2015,"Called ahead to place an order. Was put on hold. Arrived at the restaurant ten minutes later still on hold. Just for fun, kept the call going until at 11 minutes and 21 seconds the hostess looks down, says ""oops"" and disconnects the call.  In her defense they were very busy, there must have been nearly 30 people in the restaurant with no wait and it was only two hours before closing time.  Solid performance."
Joel B.,"Collierville, TN",17,125,58,5.0,11/21/2015,Favorite place in Nashville. We come here almost every time we are in town. The food is very good. I always get the Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta because it's my favorite. Samantha likes to try new things and share mine if she doesn't like. So much food I always have leftovers. Good bread. Love the cheesecake.
Regina C.,"Cordova, TN",40,142,69,5.0,9/9/2015,"This is my favorite chain and I have yet to have a bad meal from them. The menu massive and so is the portions. If you are concerned about your health, then do not go here as Cheesecake Factory is constantly on the worst things to eat lists yet it is so good! So glad we have one in Memphis now so we can save this 3 hr trip."
James S.,"Nashville, TN",0,116,5,4.0,7/28/2016,"My daughter and I love the Cheesecake Factory. The food and the decor are a fun exercise in excess. As usual I got one of the Mexican dishes. The burrito was savory and enormous, though not completely hot. I was ecstatic that she tried something new - steak, Mac and cheese and grilled broccoli- because I took home her leftovers and they were delicious. Service was spotty but l'll be back."
Joe J.,"Brentwood, TN",0,9,1,1.0,2/8/2017,Service stinks at tables in bar!  I don't understand.  It's every time.  We have to go to the bar to get our drinks.
