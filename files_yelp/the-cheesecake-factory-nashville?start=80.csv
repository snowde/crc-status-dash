Shannon P.,"Nashville, TN",0,3,,2.0,2/4/2017,"We had a party of 2 and were here for 3 hours from wait to check. The food was cold on one meal, especially fries, and beef tacos were soggy. The waitress had too many tables and wasn't able to answer menu questions. The Cool Springs location is much better."
Anna J.,"Nashville, TN",163,243,40,4.0,5/15/2014,"I normally do not like chains, but cheesecake factory offers pretty tasty dishes. I really like the curry chicken and shrimp dish, the avocado egg rolls, and of course their cheesecakes! Service is normally really great, just be prepared to wait a while if you go on the weekends! A good place to eat if you are around the mall or before going to the movies.  Probably one of the better choices of chain restaurants in the area!"
Ally V.,"Pittsburgh, PA",18,10,,2.0,8/4/2016,"I've been to multiple Cheesecake Factory's. The food was excellent, always is. However, the staff didn't attend to us very well at all. Our waiter took ten minutes to bring us our drinks. This was at lunch time, and the restaurant was not busy at all. We then left and went around the mall for a bit. We came back to get cheesecake to go and stood at the counter for about 8 minutes. Nobody attended to us or the woman in front of us. Waitresses were passing by and saw us standing there. We just left, couldn't deal anymore."
Katie C.,"Nashville, TN",15,21,1,1.0,4/3/2016,"This is the SECOND time this has happened to it's time to write this review. I went into get a piece of cheesecake and first off, the service sucked. Cheesecake is grab and go and both times I had indecisive people in front of me that took about 10 minutes to make a decision (totally fine), but the take out person failed to even acknowledge me standing there and didn't say they would be right with me or offer to help me while the person in front of me made up their mind. I ended up waiting a total of 15-20 minutes each time for one piece of cheesecake; ridiculous. To top it off, the slice I was given was TINY and $9 - everyone in my family was going crazy over the teeny tiny sliver of cheesecake that I had paid $9 for. They've definitely either made the portions smaller over the years or they aren't paying attention to even slices. Ridiculous"
Kenneth M.,"Campbellsville, KY",46,185,27,3.0,8/7/2014,"I don't understand the craze that surrounds this place.  Some things on the menu are really good (the mac and cheese balls and the desserts) and some things are downright disgusting.  I had chicken fettuccine alfredo that tasted awful and flavorless.  I have had the shepherds pie in the past and it's also gross. The location in Nashville was TOO COLD.  People were covering up with their napkins LOL  It would be funnier, if the waitress I asked about the A/C wasn't so rude."
Wenika M.,"Cape Fair, MO",3,1,,1.0,4/10/2016,Everything is good food i can give 5star but the server i don't remember her name she is completely ruined my surprise birthday for my husband she forgot what i tell her she forgot everything  and she act like nothing no apologize no nothing make me feel so bad !!!!!!i hate her and I'm not leave any dime for her tips I talk to the manager but i don't know he very talk to her !
Taylor D.,"Antioch, TN",0,2,1,1.0,7/8/2016,"I just had one of the worst restaurant experiences here. The waiter Miriam L was rude, unfriendly, and off putting. I could initially tell in her demeanor that she was about to make it a bad experience for me. I spoke with the manager Britt Long who gave a very empty insincere apology on her behalf. I should have gone to the Cheesecake Factory in Cool Springs."
Emily R.,"Germantown, TN",40,253,623,5.0,1/31/2015,Great food as usual. We had a Caesar salad then the factory meatloaf. Everything wS well prepared and well seasoned. Server was attentive and knowledgable. Service was efficient without being rushed. Drinks were kept full. Restaurant and bathroom were clean and this place was super crowded. Noise level moderate. Nice music in background.
Tabitha S.,"Murfreesboro, TN",46,219,9,5.0,11/18/2014,"We waited less than 10 minutes to be seated which went by really fast as we stood drooling over the massive case of cheesecakes on display. You name it they have it. The menu is like 20 pages long. They have a lot of option for food, drinks, and cheesecake. It can be a bit overwhelming.  All the food we had was great! Sirloin, Nachos, Crab bites, quesadilla, shepherds pie, and fettuccini. The strawberry cheesecake and the reeses peanut butter cup cheesecake were amazing as well. We all went home with left overs. It is on the pricey side but you get a lot of food. We will definitely be back!"
Stacy B.,"Brentwood, TN",171,123,73,2.0,11/8/2015,"Today I'm giving Cheesecake Factory 2 stars. My teenage son and I were eating here, Wednesday night, about 8 PM. He was bugging out on me, he was so hungry. I was literally watching him fall apart before me, and seemingly revert to a toddler once again (you know, he's 'above' reading anything his mom might write, so I don't have to worry that he'll see this, hehe).     So, the main goal was to get some food in him as quickly as possible. It was at least 5 minutes before anyone said a word to us...so I had no idea if we even had a waiter! Oh, and the hostess sat us at a table that had the floor covered with YUCK all underneath it. My son was trying to shove it out of the way with his foot - there was so much of it. It looked like a few really messy kids had sat there. I pointed it out...first mentioning it to the hostess seating us and when that was ignored, literally pointing it out to her. She did nothing. We had to sit in that filth the entire meal.  really?        I made it clear to our waiter how starving my son was, so at least he tried to get some bread out within 15 minutes, and tried to move our order along (I think). It was a loooong wait between bread and meal though. At one point he told us it was ready and being ""plated"" right then, so it would be right out. Nope...another 5-10 minutes. This is for a burger, grilled cheese and fries. Once it did come out, the fries weren't with it. He said they were cooking, but he didn't want to make us wait longer for something to eat. They did come pretty quickly after that, and were hot and fresh. My grilled cheese was good. The burger he barely touched. He said it was dry. When asked about splops on his plate that I thought was juice or grease from his burger, he assured me it was not. In fact, he said the burger was drowned in condiments, as if they were trying to make up for the dryness of the burger."
Susan M.,"Nashville, TN",0,5,,1.0,11/11/2016,"I love the CCF's food but don't do their take-out!  You get about 1/4 the amount of food you get when you dine in.  I ordered the Thai Lettuce Wraps which I order all the time while dining in but this time I ordered them to go.  It was a disaster--there were only 3 soggy pieces of lettuce, 3 small pieces of chicken, 2 sauces, about 10 carrot sticks, a few noodles and that was it.That is FAR different from what you get when you dine in.  I was so disappointed.  I won't ever do that again.  Oh, and I almost forgot--when I opened the plastic container there were a couple of fruit fly bugs that flew out!!!!!!!!!!!!  Nasty!"
Samar A.,"Washington D.C., DC",1,23,3,2.0,12/27/2015,Service is much to be desired. Floors are also incredibly dirty. It is obvious that Cheesecake Factory is taking customers for granted.
Carol M.,"Germantown, TN",150,183,30,3.0,10/15/2013,"Although I have been to The Cheesecake Factory before, this is my first visit to this particular location.  Thankfully we arrived pretty close to opening (11:00 a.m.) because this place got busy before noon.  It's possible that Friday's just tend to draw a larger than normal lunch crowd. If you have ever been to The Cheesecake Factory, then you already know the massiveness of the menu.  I opted to try something different, which is typically never the case for me.  I ordered the fried chicken salad and boy was it way more than I could possibly eat.  This was not your two strips of chicken chopped up and thrown on top.  The salad was served with five extra large pieces of chicken drizzled in a  fabulous honey mustard sauce, mixed greens and tossed in ranch dressing. Jaime was our server and she was beyond awesome!  Not only was she attentive but she was very personable."
Shelby H.,"Lebanon, TN",4,5,2,5.0,4/13/2016,"This was my first time ever at The Cheesecake Factory and I was blown away. The service was amazing as well as the food. Our server was quick and attentive but he still have my boyfriend and I our time to look over the menu, which is huge! I've never seen a menu that large, they had tons of options for everything. For our appetizer we got the Avocado, Portobello Mushrooms, and Zucchini fries. I've never had anything like these before, my favorite was the portobello mushroom ones. They were breaded, fried, had some cheese on them, and came with some amazing sauces. For entrees I got the Garlic Noodles and my boyfriend got the Cajun Noodles with chicken and shrimp. Both were superb, we left with to go boxes and we're excited for left overs! I can't wait to go back!"
Victoria N.,"Annapolis, MD",102,46,26,1.0,3/1/2016,"I went in with my friend earlier today... She ordered a mango key lime cheesecake... Which was never given to us, so I called back to see if we could pick it up. The manager ""Ryan"" said we need a receipt. Like he couldn't look it up or ask the waitress that was taking care of us that she forgot to have us the cake! I called a second time and he left me on hold! Nop never going here again. You suck Ryan."
Kathleen H.,"Nashville, TN",97,4,2,5.0,3/19/2016,"If you have not eaten the ahi taretare I seriously don't understand your life. The soy-ginger sesame sauce is life-changing. I know I sound dramatic right now but I'm 100% serious, really."
Rachel S.,"Paris, TN",6,25,42,3.0,12/10/2014,Long waits /Good service / Average entrees / Excellent cheesecake .... the oreo cheesecake is worth the $$ ... Heavenly !
Emily C.,"Nashville, TN",4,46,5,3.0,3/29/2015,"For the amount of food you get, it's great. The ambiance is nice and is great for dates. For birthday dinners, not so much - since they don't take reservations, we typically have to wait 30-45 minutes when going with groups for birthday dinners. Avoid the Asian-fusion, their orange chicken was sub-par (tasted like store bought Asian sauce) and both my boyfriend and I hated it. In comfort food, I loved their chicken biscuit and mashed potatoes. Smothered in gravy, it was a delicious cheat meal. Rich, creamy, and flavorful."
Phil J.,"Nashville, TN",0,46,,1.0,10/10/2016,"Went in to get a piece of cheesecake to take home, one piece.  Monday evening.  Made our order, waited 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes.  No cheesecake.  Went back and asked about it.  Was told they'd check.  20 minutes, finally got disgusted, got the manager and very unpleasantly got my money back, including my tip.  They have lots of business so they're not concerned."
Christina G.,"Tampa, FL",1322,988,1475,2.0,9/23/2013,"I usually love the Cheesecake Factory.  However this one had a long wait and horrible service. First of all, when we first got there they said it would take 15 to 20 minutes for a table.  That sounded reasonable, but it definitely took longer than that!  At least 30 minutes!  Please don't lie about the wait time, because we were in a rush to make an appointment and that would have factored heavily into our decision. Once we sat down we knew what we wanted right away.  We ordered three appetizers, the Tuna Tartare, the Avocado Egg Rolls, and the Chicken Lettuce Wraps, because we wanted to try different things.  I was really surprised that we were never given bread!  That might have made the wait time a little more bearable, because we ended up waiting over half an hour for our food!   Our waitress kept avoiding us, because she must have known we were not happy.  We didn't even get an apology.  And it wasn't even just our table!  I noticed the table behind us didn't even get their food until we were done and they had gotten there first. As for the actual food, the Tuna Tartare and the Chicken Lettuce Wraps were delicious, but the Avocado Egg Roll needs something more than avocados.  I felt like it was death by avocados. We requested our bill when we first got the food, because we really needed to go and it still took forever to get it!  Do yourself a favor and only eat here if you have hours to spare and do not care about the wait.  Otherwise, I would not suggest this place to anyone."
