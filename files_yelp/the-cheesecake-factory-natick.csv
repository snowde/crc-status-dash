Joanna R.,"Portland, ME",139,223,3360,4.0,1/7/2018,"We have been to this location once and overall it was fine and what I would expect from a large chain. It's located at a very busy shopping location which has also been my past experience. With that being said, if you don't like crowds, don't come here, it is wall-to-wall people. Park in the lot or the garage - parking is ridiculous and annoying in the holiday season. Be patient. We arrived shortly after 11am during the week and it wasn't crowded ...yet. We were seated within a couple of minutes. If you are in a party of 2, you will definitely seat faster than the larger groups. The host was meh, he wasn't friendly, but was prompt in addressing groups. He was more business than customer service. That's fine, he was just moving the human cattle through to their seats. Our server greeted us with a smile and was pleasant. Not over the top and not too verbose. She was great throughout the entire experience. Keep our drinks filled, checked in with us the appropriate amount of time, we never felt we had to look for her. I observed her with other customers and she was great and they seemed to be pleased with her as well. The food was what we expect, a lot and decent. The starting bread...perfect as always, it's unlimited, so don't hesitate to ask for me, but don't fill up if you ordered and entree, unless you are ok with taking leftovers home. They are consistent with the burgers and fries. You can customize them, from temperature to toppings. The toasted buttered bun, YUM! Don't forget to listen for the specials from apps to soup to entree to dessert. We ended up getting the special cheesecake, pumpkin pie pecan cheesecake. Wow, it was pretty good. Overall, for our only experience, it was a good experience and if we are in the area, we would definitely go back. A lot of options for everyone in your party, just be prepared to wait."
Helena O.,"Worcester, MA",124,74,158,1.0,11/18/2017,"I meeeeean, if you still decide to come here with the (already) poor ratings, that's your prerogative. I came here with a friend and ordered the miso salmon. It looked sooooo good and I couldn't wait to taste it. As I took a bite, I felt a crunch. Then another crunch. It was so loud my friend looked at me and asked if I was grinding my teeth. No, friend - there was glass in my food. Lovely! I immediately notified staff and was given a huge apology, and corporate (from California) ended up calling me, apologetic about the issue. My advice: Do not come here. Do not waste your money. The food isn't good and apparently the staff is very careless. I wouldn't recommend to any of my loved ones."
Brandon K.,"Westwood, MA",161,1505,24566,4.0,10/15/2017,"My experiences at the Cheesecake Factory always range. Even though it should be, nothing is ever exactly consistent.  Well, the real reason for only four stars versus five is because of the chefs. Unfortunately, the chefs at the Natick location have a few lessons to learn still... maybe they are just less experienced than those in Chestnut Hill or maybe it was an off day. Just to note, cheeseburgers should never ever be coated all around the edges with cheese. It looked like they actually had the nerve to place at least three pieces of cheese on my burger. I actually had to take my silverware and get some of it off, because it was just way too much. I am willing to give them another go though.  With that said, service all around was spectacular. Meghan was very friendly and attentive to our table. She was consistent and efficient, which was great. The host was also fabulous. Even with the crowds and crowds of people waiting around at the Cheesecake Factory, she was very efficient and organized in keeping everyone moving along efficiently. Seating is comfortable and overall the decor of the Cheesecake Factory is phenomenal. It's like a palace in a sense.  The complimentary bread is delicious and the quality of the food is very good. I had a small issue with much too much cheese on my burger, but overall, my meal was still pretty good.  I would come in the future as I have frequented the Cheesecake Factory over the years, mainly on holidays. We have stopped coming here on holidays due to the congestion and long, long wait times (which are present very frequently at nearly all the Cheesecake Factory locations).  Either way, this is a decent restaurant in the Natick Mall, but not the absolute favorite of mine, especially considering all the options. 4 stars."
Mark D.,"Plainville, MA",27,94,104,4.0,5/15/2017,"Went here on Mother's Day in the afternoon and the place was a zoo! Don't go on Mother's Day. We had a 2 hour wait to be seated, luckily the mall is there. That being said the meal was really good. I ordered the herb-crusted filet of salmon. It was perfectly cooked and very flavorful. The middle was rare which is fine with me but perhaps not others. The mashed potatoes, asparagus, and lemon sauce were tasty accompaniments. I wish the portion wasn't so big and filling, I would have gotten cheescake!"
Shauna L.,"Leominster, MA",30,128,241,1.0,7/8/2017,"I think this chain restaurant was great way back when it began. But now..... It's just overrated and over priced and really nothing special at all!  We decided to come here because we hadn't been to a Cheesecake Factory in some time and my husband and friend have a sweet tooth that rules their world.  Bad choice on my part I guess.  We shared a few apps and since they were all pretty much nothing special I pulled the trigger and said we would go elsewhere for our mains.  We got: the chicken pot stickers. These were basically the frozen pot stickers that you can buy at your local supermarket. Doughy and filled with a mushy slimy chicken glump.  The loaded tater tots. I had one and one was too many. They were just a tasteless lump of mushy mashed potato (where was the ""loaded"" part) and the sour cream was literally frozen! There was a huge glump of frozen sour cream in the middle of the bowl and the rest was just a thin liquid. Ick!  The last item was a crab(less) cakes. Seriously. Where was the crab? Was it replaced with bread and bread crumbs?! No taste and just a mushy mess. No thank you!  The guys couldn't leave without have a piece of cheesecake. I mean that's what this place is called right.... So it's gotta be good.  One got the Godiva chocolate and the other the a snickers or something. Both said it wasn't something they HAD to have again.  3 apps. Two glasses of wine. 1 draft beer. And 2 mojitos. Total. Too much! $102 bucks and not including the tip.  I can't stand how these restaurants charge so much for frozen gross food!  Not worth it. Never again. Cheers and goodbye Cheesecake Factory forever."
Tamra K.,"Fitchburg, MA",24,4,,2.0,1/8/2018,"My Husband and I came there for dinner last night and was very disappointed in our server and our entree I don't recall his name he was a short Italian man. First of all when he brought our beverage my husbands wasn't what he ordered so the server said he would go get the right one, which he did about 10-15 minutes later. Then he brought us bread and butter. We went to butter a piece of the bread and neither one of us had a knife so we used our fork to try and spread the butter. He finally came back and took our dinner order and I asked him for a couple of knives which again we never got!! Well now here comes our dinner and again I asked for knives again and he said oh shit I'm sorry!! And walked away so we assumed he went to get the knives, Nope! Now I am so upset at this point. So I proceed to eat my meal and my pasta was cold and dry as well as my husbands this was the worse meal I think I ever had the meatballs were hard. We were very much unhappy with our overall experience there last night :("
Chau L.,"North Reading, MA",15,129,211,3.0,5/19/2017,"This location was my first Cheesecake experience. My foodie life all started here first.  Came here on a Friday evening with my GF. There was no wait time and that was very surprising because we came around 6. It was so nice out so we chosen our door dining. The service was good,  but not our waitress. She was kinda slow. It probably took her about 15 mins to get our drink because she was busy talking to her workers and we can see it all from where we were sitting.  I had the fried fish taco with double cilantro lime rice with no beans. I was blown away from the serving size. It came with 4 delicious fish tacos and a massive size of rice. The tacos were absolutely amazing. It had perfect beer batter and great flavors. The fish taco had cabbagewith purple onions that had seasoning on them, pico de gallo and topped of with avocado. Even the soft taco shell tasted delicious. The rice was very good with a ton of flavor. I think beside the Louisiana pasta, the fish tacos are my new favorite dish here."
Ej A.,"VINEYARD HVN, MA",1,78,,4.0,11/12/2017,Wife and kid loved it.  Joe was a good server. I think it was Joe. Smooth guy. Very good food and menu. Very creative menu. Nothing to dislike.  Can't wait to go back some day.
Uday B.,"Brighton, MA",16,23,33,4.0,11/7/2017,I love this place as it has almost all the cuisines and delicious food at great price. The only thing is the wait times can get little bit longer if you come on weekends or peak lunch/dinner hours. Other than that I love the food and drinks they have and the location is great as its next to Natick Mall!
Colleen P.,"North Olmsted, OH",198,282,255,3.0,6/30/2017,"Went for lunch on Tuesday around 1:30PM.  Very busy. It took forever to get my sangria, like way too long. I understand they were busy but cmon.  Server was very nice, but also very busy.  Overall santa fe salad was awesome and my dad enjoyed the chicken. Also, no wifi? WTF"
Garrett Y.,"Milton, MA",190,312,987,1.0,4/6/2017,"I've been to Cheesecake Factory many times, and this particular visit was one of the worst. We visited around 3:45 pm, which was apparently around when shifts change. We were greeted by our first server, who brought us water, our drinks and bread. We ordered food, and everything was fine. About 10 minutes after taking our order, our server introduces another woman who would be taking over, and reassured that our food had been ordered and be ready. Our original server then came back about 5 minutes later and told us that she had introduced the wrong person to us, and that our server was another guy. Meanwhile we were waiting and waiting for our food. The table next to us, had ordered their food at the same time, ate, and paid their bill before we even got our lunch. I finally got the attention of our third server and mentioned the fact that we had been waiting and the table next to us was done with their lunch when we ordered about the same time. Our food eventually came out another 5 minutes later. I think in total we waited 35 minutes for a salad and a burger. Yes, a salad and a burger. Our third server was just not very good. He never apologized for the delay. He didn't check our ask if how our food was. He never refilled our water. We ordered cheesecake, and he didn't offer to comp dessert. I will go back to Cheesecake Factory again, but never around shift changes!! Cheesecake Factory will need to earn back their stars!"
Nick U.,"Shelburne Falls, MA",0,9,10,4.0,10/20/2017,Menu was huge.  Great selection of food.  Had a guacamole salad. Service was top notch.  Very enjoyable lunch experience.
Diner B.,"Franklin, MA",0,14,,2.0,1/3/2018,"I am being charitable in giving 2 stars. The server was fine, the manager wa apologetic. The chicken with biscuits arrived as one big mess on the plate with a gravy that had separated to reveal just how much grease was in there. Biscuits were hard, carrots were mush. I have eaten at Cheesecake Factory before and never seen such an unappetizing plate."
Jo C.,"Worcester, MA",2,99,111,5.0,9/3/2017,"Love coming here! They have so many options that it's so hard to choose from! There is also a healthy menu option.  We ordered the Da Vinci pasta as well as the shrimp and steak combo. The Da Vinci pasta was absolutely delicious! It is cream based and buttery and a bit sweet but delicious!  The shrimp and steak combo was also delicious! The shrimp had a garlic cream sauce while the steak had a red wine sauce.  The portions are huge, you get what you pay for!  The cheesecakes are delicious! We had the anniversary birthday cake which had strawberry and vanilla flavors!  I love coming back here!"
Justin M.,"Millbury, MA",1,15,1,5.0,12/9/2017,"We went in for lunch the Saturday after Thanksgiving, and as always, it did not disappoint. I had a cheeseburger and my wife had the breakfast burrito, both meals were delicious, and my wife had enough to bring home for another meal. We sat in one of the hightop tables at the bar and our waitress, Liz, was above average, great personality and very attentive. I, of course, had to get a piece of cheesecake to go, went with the Oreo this time. We will definitely be back!"
Carrie R.,"Franklin, MA",0,18,14,2.0,11/24/2017,"Every time I come here I have such high hopes because they have an awesome menu! Then I get my meal and it's usually cold. The dishes are all overwhelmed with pasta and seriously lack meat and vegetables or whatever else they're supposed to come with. Service is always awesome, and cheesecake is actually to die for especially the Reese's! However I won't be returning here for anything BUT cheesecake from now on."
John H.,"Westwood, MA",0,24,63,4.0,3/2/2017,"Food selection has something for everyone. A decent Gluten Free selection. I had the Shepard's Pie and I'd highly recommend it. Server, Jorge, was great. He helped with our selections and was spot on. Gluten Free Cheesecake was great.  My only knock was the lightning is sort of dark which makes it more difficult to read the menu."
Chandra J.,"Dallas, TX",151,222,161,4.0,1/28/2017,"Was craving a burger and had heard for years that Cheesecake Factory had some of the best burgers! So, a few friends and I headed there last Saturday night and enjoyed ourselves. We had to wait for about 45 minutes for a table, but it was well worth it as we were sat at a large round table in a quieter section of the restaurant. Our waiter quickly came over amd took our drink orders. He was very nice, brought us some of their extra wheat and sourdough bread, and just overall made us feel very welcomed. As always Cheesecake Factory does not fall short when it comes to their food selection and portion sizes. I was so happily overwhelmed by the number of appetizers, salads, entrees, sandwiches, and pastas they had listed on their menu. I came in with the idea that I wanted a burger, but their salmon and chicken dishes were calling me. However, I stuck to my plan and got their mushroom burger.  This burger was one of the best burgers I've ever had. It was big, but not too big and stuffed with crisp lettuce, tomato, grilled onions and mushrooms, and a sweet and tangy aoli sauce. I did not want the burger to stoo, but unfortunately my stomach had other plans and stopped it for me. I ended up taking half of it home along with the broccoli that I ordered as a side (i love that they did not charge me for subsituting the side like a lot of restaurants do). The minus one star came from the cheesecake as it was not as rich and decadent as I remember it being. Definitely fell flat in the taste and size department, but still had the $8 price tag. I hope that this was just a one time incident as I usually love their cheesecake, but not this time.  4 stars for the service and the food--minus the cheesecake."
K O.,"Northborough, MA",27,39,5,3.0,10/21/2017,"Unimpressive. Pros: the restaurant seems is inviting, comfy chairs. Waitress was happy, enthusiastic. Food was good. Cons: crazy crowded, horrible parking- you have to park in the garage and dodge traffic on the way there. Extremely expensive- we had a burger, salad and sandwich, one soft drink and 3 cheesecakes to go....bill with tip-$95!!"
Nicole D.,"Bristol, CT",341,1543,221,4.0,5/1/2017,"I stopped here for happy hour with my Mom and it hit the spot. It's part of the Natick Mall area, though I don't think you can actually restaurant the restaurant from the mall, as the front door we entered was outside the mall. There's a huge parking lot but it can get kinda packed since it's a busy mall. They do have a patio for some outdoor seating. Our waitress was friendly, and the food was pretty good. I would recommend the zucchini fries as an appetizer - I hadn't tried those before, and I was surprised by how good they are!"
Erika M.,"Springfield, MA",36,168,43,4.0,10/10/2016,"I am a lover of Cheesecake Factory. I don't stray often from my favorites but if I'm with someone who orders something else, I always give it a try. I always get the Thai lettuce Wraps, it's an appetizer but I have it as a meal. It is hands down my favorite thing to eat here...well besides the cheesecake.  I've tried their burgers, pastas and salads and I am never disappointed.  Now for cheesecake, the best one I think is seasonal, the pumpkin pecan cheesecake...OMG it is to die for. I am of the belief that it should be a year round option. So when this isn't available I get the fresh banana cream cheesecake and I really like it.  This is a great place because there's something here for everyone."
Michael B.,"South Grafton, MA",2,87,14,4.0,9/26/2017,"Ordered a salad and added grilled steak. Ordered it rare. However when it was served it was raw and still cold. Even asked everyone else at my table and they all agreed that it was way underdone. The server put in another order for the steak. Unfortunately the second time it came out it was still raw. By now the manager got involved and put in another order for the steak. The third time it did come out perfect, but by that time I had already eaten my salad. The manager did correct the issue and even removed my meal from the bill. This is why I am giving it 4 stars instead of two."
Mark M.,"Franklin, MA",0,6,,5.0,9/29/2017,"The menu selection was good and the service was great. Our waiter, Ben H. was second to none. A real gentleman and professional. The atmosphere was pleasant but very noisy due to the place being completely packed. Overall, my family and I really enjoyed the food and had a great experience. We will definitely be back again."
Mark C.,"Bronx, NY",34,57,5,4.0,5/1/2017,"This place has a huge list of food to choose from. If you're a lover of food then you might have a hard time making a decision. The portions are pretty big with the exception of the ""Skinnylicious"" menu. All the food tastes very fresh. Like new. The atmosphere is not bad. Kind of packed or squished, but as long as you get nice neighbors you will be happy. Quiet music in the background.  The only reason I'm taking one star off is because this place is always busy. You might end up waiting like two hours just to get a seat. And then comes waiting for the food to cook."
Nikki G.,"Whitinsville, MA",0,5,5,1.0,10/1/2017,"Tried the factories brunch today. Totally disappointing. I have had better at local greasy spoons.  The mystery liquid they call maple syrup was a turn off for this New Englander. My Crispy Monte Cristo was not crispy and the waitress gave me a crushed straw that sprayed OJ on my shirt when I attempted to drink it. Service was horrible and although beautiful weather to sit out, we were pestered by bees the entire time so bring an epi pen."
Marilee C.,"Glastonbury, CT",49,241,14,3.0,9/25/2016,"A really mixed bag. I assume everyone knows the basics: huge menu, tons of great desserts, casual family dining. So, I'll tell you about our most recent visit. Our server, Dana, was very nice, and attentive without being overbearing. However, the kitchen desperately failed her.  Out of eight orders, the kitchen got three wrong. Including one mistake that was an allergy issue. It wasn't a huge issue (relatively minor allergy symptoms), but I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone that has life-threatening allergies. On other visits, the kitchen has been great, but the service was poor. The hostesses are always unpleasant. All in all, an acceptable choice in the area, if you can roll with the punches."
D J.,"Norfolk, MA",0,46,2,2.0,11/13/2017,"So about a month ago we came here.  We got here at 7:00 pm on a Monday.  We were told it was a 15-20 minute wait.  Ok cool.  Almost an hour passes.  The buzzer goes off.  Cool.  Go to our table with the hostess.  Our table had not been bussed.  Given another buzzer.  Wait about 25 more minutes.  Now it is 8:20 pm.  We are seated.  We are ready to order and tell the server to break the check two ways between the four of us.  Tell server we want to order but she insists she will be right back.  Comes back and asks us for drinks only.  People tell her some very simple drinks.  15 minutes later she comes back.  Uhhh sorry, the bar tender does not know how to make these (seriously come on these are elementary style drinks that involve mixing soda and alcohol any bar world wide will have them be it a dive or 5 star one).  Ok we ordered food this go around also.  15 minutes later the rest of the drinks come.  All the mix drinks were devoid of substantial alcohol, In the rare cases, I drink I want to be able to taste liquor not just soda/mixer.  Come on now.  I complained and she told me that i'm not a bar tender. (how freaking rude is that?)  Ok so the food finally comes out it's well past 9pm.  People eat.  We ask for boxes and to order cheese cake to go as well as get a check and she ghosted on us.  we waited until 10:15 including asking other servers to send our server to us (they did not)  I go to the mens room and I see her just chatting to another server.  Come on is this amateurs night? She comes back finally.  (Sans check cheesecake and boxes)  Ask's us what we want for cheese cake again?  She finally brings it, brings the check (obviously not split as we requested) and boxes.  Finally, pay and get out of there at 10:30.  I wasted 3 and a half hours in your establishment.  I usually tip 20-30% but this time I tipped your server 8 cents.  So if one of them was upset about it that was me.  You don't treat well-paying customers like that.  The only reason this review has two stars is that my dinner was fantastic.  Needless to say the four of us will never come back to a cheese cake factory."
Jon G.,"Branford, CT",6,54,,5.0,9/2/2017,IM REALLY AMAZED BY HOW NICE THE STAFF ARE HERE! They just also have so many great food options! THANK YOU SO MUCH CHEESECAKE FACTORY EMPLOYEES! Just keep up the amazing work guys! Well at least I can say for sure that the times that I've come here have not been crowded at all!
Or R.,"Mission Viejo, CA",14,5,,1.0,11/6/2016,"The worst location ever! I ordered the Pasta De Vinci gluten-free without chicken and cheese and I got just a pasta with some mushrooms on top, and that's after I was waiting like 30 minutes. One time I even sat on the bar at 2:00 PM when the restaurant was almost empty, and no one approached me for 10 minutes, and that was after I raised my hand. I mean.. seriously?  Think twice before you go there."
Joshua R.,"Hatfield, MA",0,17,,4.0,2/4/2017,"Very good food as usual. This place usually is pretty consistent with its quality of food and service. We tried the avocado rolls and they were fantastic! We also tried the bang bang shrimp and chicken. It was very flavorful and the rice that came with it was cooked perfectly. Dishes are doing to be above average price , however, it is worth it."
Zi N.,"Waltham, MA",355,44,334,5.0,11/15/2016,I haven't tried dine-in at this restaurant but I've come here plenty of time for their cheesecakes. Their desserts are insanely good and I'm not even a sweet tooth. Got the Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake the other day - it blew my mind! Definitely will update this review once I get to eat in and try out their food menu.
Angela S.,"Boston, MA",119,117,173,2.0,8/16/2015,"Cheesecake Factory has always been one of my favorite go to place for a lunch with a friend and/or a romantic dinner with my boo! Their menu is endless and I always try something new every time I go!  Food: This time I ordered the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp. It's basically white rice with chicken and shrimp, with Thai curry sauce and coconut shredding. Delicious.  Service: I don't remember our waiter's name but he was alright. He was good till the very end. He gave us the bill, we looked at it, looks good, ok, charge! Gave it back to us and the bill amount increased. He had forgotten to add a side dish that we ordered. Granted, that we didn't notice it either however as a courtesy he still should've came and notified us what he was adding before automatically charging it on our credit card! I thought that was not right at all so that is why they deserve two stars for my recent experience! Not to mention two weeks ago, I had ordered strawberry shortcake for take out and when I opened the container there was a small cockroach under the biscuits. I quickly took it back (which was no more than ten minutes) and the manager came and said ""That's weird. This never happens."" I felt like she was accusing me instead of being apologetic. I don't think I would put a cockroach in in my own food, what do I get out of it? She asked if I wanted new biscuits. Uh no, how about my money back?"
C R.,"Charlton, MA",0,74,8,2.0,4/30/2017,"Normally wouldn't review TCF as its pretty straight forward and usually consistent. Today's lunch was disappointing. We ordered 3 apps to share: the Cuban rolls, fried mac n cheese and the French country salad. The salad lacked dressing and didn't have enough pecans, asparagus or beets. The other items were EXTREMELY greasy/oily. Like pools of oil in the bottom of the cast iron dish (rolls) and AROUND the vodka sauce under the mac n cheese balls. The Cuban rolls became soggy and ""wet"" from sitting in their own grease. (I'm obviously not complaining from some pretentious ""health perspective"", we ordered fried food. But it should have been drained and plated properly). The apps just lacked flavor overall and nothing stood out.  I decided to venture out beyond my standard Godiva cheesecake order and we tried the s'mores cheesecake. Awesome! Only good thing! HOWEVER, we asked the remaining cheesecake be boxed and waitress got marshmallow on EVERYTHING. The container, the bag, ICK!! Opened it up later on and looked like a bomb went off. Swear she squeezed it threw her f-ing hands when she put it in the container... would explain the residual mess."
Roshan R.,"Rochester, NY",66,49,,5.0,11/8/2016,"Fried cheese - 5/5 Breaded a avocado, mushroom n zucchini platter - 3.5/5 Pasta - 4/5 Quantity and price - 5/5 Ambience and crowd 4/5 Loved it."
Steve S.,"Natick, MA",43,23,2,2.0,9/3/2017,"Twice in a row ordered the strawberry shortcake, twice they've ""run out."" Both times were on the early side of dinner. This isn't unusual. Be prepared to hear what they don't have. Disappointed diners do not make for a loyal user base."
Kristy C.,"Acton, MA",0,5,,5.0,9/30/2017,I dream about the shrimp scampi. It's my absolute favorite. And tonight we had the chicken taquitos which were unreal. But we got cheesecake to go and I'm super annoyed that the Reese's cheesecake description didn't tell me that there are actual peanuts in it.
Eric D.,"Holliston, MA",0,1,,1.0,8/18/2017,"The place is always a zoo and parking a nightmare. Food is good but expect a long, long wait. They have completely outgrown this space and should move to a bigger place. Knowing this  my wife and I with our 2 year old called ahead from Speen Street which is about 5 minutes away and asked how long the wait was. The girl that answered the phone said the place was empty and we would get right in. She even went as far to say the bar was empty. Upon arriving 6 minutes later after getting lucky finding a parking spot not far away I walked into the restaurant. There must have been 50 people in there! I got up to the desk and said I just called and you said the place was empty? What's the deal? She said it got busy and can change in here quickly. I said in 6 minutes??? She was a typical sensitive millennial girl so of coarse she ran away upset to get her manager rather than tackle a situation on her own. Out comes the manager and I said I called 6 minutes ago and she said the place was empty now it's a wait? He said sorry I don't know what to say? I said you people lie on the phone to get people in here and that's not right. It's impossible that it filled this quickly. He smirked and said sorry rather than fixing the problem. He's a horrible manager and deserves to be fired. I told him I would Yelp it and he didn't seem to care. Hope he loses his job."
James C.,"Framingham, MA",0,22,10,5.0,7/31/2016,"Though it is a little on the expensive side, all the food and drinks are excellent. Personally, I don't mind paying a little more for better quality food. Friendly staff, have never had a bad experience here. They also have a great brunch and of course the cheesecake."
Caroline D.,"Blackstone, MA",0,46,62,3.0,8/21/2017,"I mean, it's Cheesecake Factory.  Although I do usually enjoy the food and appreciate the large portions.  The food isn't always great, though, and the service has never been spectacular (as I've found to be the case with almost every CF I've been to).  This location is tough to love being in the Natick Mall/that part of Rt 9/Rt 9 in general (I am admittedly biased after working at Shoppers World and living in Framingham for years).  They have curbside pickup where they walk it out to your car if you're doing takeout.  They also have takeout designated parking spaces somewhat towards the front which always seem to be taken by cars not leaving anytime soon.  Annoying when all of the other spaces are taken by mall-goers if you're just looking to get a meal at CF, but that's what you get anywhere close to peak hours.  It's a chain restaurant so for the most part you know what you're getting.  It just happens to be a chain with slightly higher quality food (at least in presentation) for more-than-slightly higher prices.  Oh, and there's almost always a wait to be seated.  Natick Mall problems."
John Y.,"Brighton, MA",121,10,,4.0,7/20/2016,"The take-out service is great and fast, but the food could be a little better. The cheesecake of course is phenomenal and the price is high, but I think that the steak and fried foods can come out later or be kept warm. I was also a little disappointed in the quality of the bread that came with the crab dip. Really hard. Employees were very nice though."
