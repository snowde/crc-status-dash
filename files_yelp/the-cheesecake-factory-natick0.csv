Jenn C.,"Marlborough, MA",17,94,5,2.0,4/7/2011,"Meh explains it. Went for lunch with Mom today. Ordered the Pear and Endive salad and asked for it without the nuts (allergic) Mom ordered the Asian Salad. They were huge, I mean enough salad to feed a family of four in almost any other country. The salad's arrived, mine had nuts on the top and Mom;s was covered in way, way too much crunchy noodle things. The waiter that delivered the salads was not the waiter that took our order, I told him of the nut mistake and my allergies and he promptly brought the salad back to the kitchen.  So while we're waiting for a new salad, a manager comes over and apologizes for the misunderstanding, but also worded his apology to include that it may have been my error, he wasn't sure.  Can you say Insulting and Offensive?  The new salad was decent, the greens were fresh and it was huge, but honestly I don't think I'm going to rush back there any time soon.  Luckily I pay attention and I only have a mild allergy, can you imagine if... No need to say more."
Julie B.,"Cambridge, MA",53,31,,2.0,6/3/2010,"Not a big fan. The food is very generic and in my opinion overpriced, and I always feel a bit overwhelmed by the size of the menu. My biggest complaint though is that last time I was there I saw a munch of mice while sitting on the patio. They were living in a hole near the edge of the patio. Gross."
Rita V.,"Hudson, MA",153,1149,86,2.0,4/27/2011,"I've never really been a fan of this chain for a multitude of reasons, although I really enjoy the CHOCOLATE CAKE!  I normally visit Met Burger or Sel de la Terre for lunch, but given this is one of our Secretary's favorite places, we bit the bullet and went.  Food is not upscale or ""foodie-ish"", it IS a chain restaurant in the ""Unos/Olive Garden"" type of category.  Food is ok, average food, average price and average service.  All the diners at our table were happy with their burgers, and for not being a latin restaurant, the cuban was ok.  They have a very broad and confusing menu, but there is something for almost everybody and a lot of drink selections (although I am also picky with my alcohol, and really, the best bar in the mall IS @ Sel....).  I had asked our server for one simple request, and she forgot it.  Tried to rectify it in the end but by then we were leaving.  Our Host was extremely personable, I wonder why our server seemed so uninterested and aloof.  But we were enjoying each others company, and the food was ok, so thank you Cheesecake for delivering what our special someone really enjoys - her food with her people."
Caren B.,"Dedham, MA",112,48,21,3.0,12/7/2011,"I was in last month and had the worst service ever but ate here last week and the service was amazing, besides the pound of pepper that was added to my Pasta DaVinci. I guess that it is hit or miss here."
David P.,"Springfield, MA",1,20,,4.0,3/9/2014,"If you love dessert, then you have to love Cheesecake Factory....that's what it's all about. We've learned to just sit in the bar area, order drinks, a few apps, and cheesecake. But, be warned...the menu is huge. In four visits, we still haven't tried everything. And, maybe we're getting harder to please, but we had to question the cleanliness of the silverware. And, we were surprised to find that there was no Wi-Fi. But, oh man, the cheesecake is delish."
Michelle S.,"Fairbanks, AK",30,628,25,4.0,9/27/2011,"I used not really like the food at Cheesecake Factory - just the desserts but they've really started to win me over.  Some time back, I wrote a review for a Cheesecake Factory - in Burlington, I think and my favorite thing then was the Thai lettuce wraps.  I have a new favorite now - the Chicken Bellagio.  It's chicken that is pounded super thin, breaded and then fried - not just one breast, but two (for taking home for leftovers).  The chicken is topped with proscuitto and cheese and then it sits atop angel hair with pesto sauce.  The thing that makes the whole dish is the arugula nest on top of it all.  Love it.  I can't get enough.  I popped the whole second portion in the freezer and when I wanted it, put the chicken breast in the oven, a touch of milk in a pan with the noodles and sauce and meal number two was served.  My partner got the farfalle (bow tie pasta) with roasted garlic, caramelized onions and peas in a parmesan cream sauce.  It was awesome too.  The caramelized onions really make the dish.  The we topped it off with cheesecake.  Since it's not yet October, I couldn't get my favorite pumpkin so decided on something new - the lemon raspberry cheesecake.  It was good but not as good as my favorite pineapple upside down cheesecake.  My partner got something new too - a special Hershey's edition cheesecake.  She said the same, it was good but not as good as her favorite - the chocolate tuxedo cream cheesecake.   The worst is the wait but since most are at a mall, it's easier to find something to do while waiting.  It's also a pretty noisy place so it's not as a great a place to take older patrons as it's too hard to hear one another."
Melissa R.,"Attleboro, MA",6,2,1,5.0,4/26/2012,I have to say that I've eaten at cheesecake factory many times and always been happy. Tonight was exceptional! My daughter ordered the burrito and requested no peppers. Unfortunately it still came with the peppers. Normally we are not the kind if people who say anything but she really couldn't eat it.  We politely told the waiter and he profusely apologized and insisted on getting a new one.  This is what one would normally expect.  What was totally impressive is within 2 minutes the manager came over and also apologized.  Then came more...the manager personally delivered the new plate and said it would not be on our bill.  I've rarely received this level of service even from fancy restaurants.  I just wanted to say how impressed I was and thank you for such great service!!
Susan D.,"Sarasota, FL",10,55,16,4.0,11/30/2011,What I love about this place is they are consistant. Evelyn's Favorite Pasta is so good. Good place for groups. The portions are huge it is easy to split a dish. The reason for only fours stars is there is not a lot of parking as the mall is always busy.
Paul G.,"League City, TX",0,12,,5.0,4/24/2014,"Your mileage may vary with chains, especially extra-busy locations, but we had a great experience here because of our server Kaitlyn. She not only got the kids in my party served quickly, but she was ready with another beverage before I even realized I needed one! Very pleasant and she knew the incredibly lengthy menu back to front. The food as usual was very good and the wait for a table was manageable."
Bethany B.,"Boston, MA",311,451,19,4.0,12/10/2008,"I was too hungry to catch the servers name.  I was too hungry to pay attention to ambiance and nuances.  I was too hungry to care about cleanliness of the table.  This is what I can tell you. The Steak Diane was good. The tips (medallions? no) were chewier than they should have been but the accompanying mushrooms, onions and mashed potatoes carried the dish. I could have had a plate of just those sides and been a happy diner.  Also, I don't know Linda but I have eaten her Fudge Cake. If I could I would take that cake into a quiet corner, lay it down on a bed of whipped cream and have my way with it again if I had my chance. It was THAT good.  This is a chain people, like Denny's with a fancy schmancy menu. Don't expect gourmet, expect the expected."
adrianna C.,"Winchester, MA",91,38,,4.0,9/6/2008,"This is my favorite chain rest... YUMMY.YUMMY..Lets start witht he drinks, great selction for a smooth drink to relax after a long day  at work. I prefer the lettuce wraps and the spinach dip. The lettuce wrapes get messy, but are very good. The arent as good as PF Changs, however they are still worth trying. There Entree menu is also great. Great portions and selection. Try the Tons of fun burger , its really a treat. Prices are also great and staff is very nice. Top notch for a chain..... A."
Fernanda K.,"Wakefield, MA",30,68,45,3.0,8/12/2011,"I went to Cheesecake Factory for the first time last night, as it was someone's birthday and that's where she wanted to go.  I was pleasantly surprised. I tend to not want to like the chain restaurants since I prefer to support the little guys and gals. They were out of the mahi-mahi, so I had Evelyn's Favorite Pasta, with artichokes, calamata olives, pine nuts, and other great stuff. Desert was good too, but I still prefer to find personal, family-owned little gems. I would gladly not go back, but if I had to go back again, I would still enjoy my meal."
Julia W.,"Framingham, MA",21,54,4,2.0,6/5/2008,"Don't get me wrong, I love the Cheesecake Factory. Their portions are enormous, their desserts (although packing more than 1,500 calories a piece) are delicious, and the atmosphere is whimsical. However, I despise the Natick Collection. The Natick Mall was once a nice place to catch a bite at the food court and do some window shopping. Now it is filled with Euro Trash and over-priced designer crapola that has managed to spill out into the Cheesecake Factory. Try a 2 hour wait (on a good day), being pushed aside by raging yuppies, and angry wait-staff (you can't blame them due to the clientele). Avoid this place at all costs and try the Cambridge Side Galleria Cheesecake Factory instead."
Bryan D.,"Oxford, MA",11,480,73,3.0,8/4/2011,"My family are huge fans of this place. So every special occasion when they get to pick where we go for dinner, this is the spot. The wait is usually very long. The wait staff is hit or miss. Last night our waitress messed up every special request we asked for (no onions, changed sides, etc). Her voice made me want to hang myself and the only time she wanted to clear empty plates was when she came back for the bill. Our meals were as expected, except for a piece of plastic in one meal. So, i go here when everyone else makes me but its not a place i request to eat at."
Po L.,"San Francisco, CA",144,627,1,4.0,6/9/2009,"Cheesecake Factory you are a factory. You guys are consistent and have a great selection of food.  It's good for groups, except for waiting to accommodate their size, and has something for everyone. I sat right away and the server was very attentive and nice even though our group could be considered a bit difficult.  When ever you come here you always have left overs and therefore you get to enjoy it twice. 3 stars on food 1 Star for the consistency and customer service."
Alexa R.,"Medway, MA",0,9,,5.0,11/7/2011,"The wait for this restaurant is always extremely intimidating, but DO NOT BE. The wait is never as long as it seems or as they say it is. I've been a million times and it is usually never more than 20-30 minutes.  The food is fantastic. The menu is large and eclectic. You name a type of food, they have it! There is something for everyone which is great. Whatever you are in the mood for they'll have it. The Tuna Carpaccio appetizer is amazing! It's super thin and tastes great. Their avocado eggrolls are also to die for. The cook their burgers to perfection also! Although it can be pricy at times, it is totally worth it to go out every once in awhile. This place is awesome!!  And of course the cheesecake is fantastic. It is the Cheesecake Factory after all. I'm not even a big cheesecake fan and I think it's amazing. Try the snickers bar cheesecake, explosion of taste right there! And of course the cheesecake is fantastic. It is the Cheesecake Factory after all.

Ryan B.,"Framingham, MA",0,3,,4.0,10/30/2013,This place is the best in town by far. Great ambience and fresh food from what i was informed by our waitress. The best customer service. I will most deffinetly be back soon.
Tanya T.,"Westborough, MA",0,6,,4.0,9/6/2013,"I came to the Cheesecake Factory for the first time with my boyfriend. It was a success! I loved the table set up, the atmosphere, etc. I loved it all. The food was AMAZING and the cheesecake was even better! However my waitress did take a long time to attended us and bring us our food but you can get that anywhere. Yes I'm a fan!"
Allison R.,"Somerville, MA",239,689,173,3.0,7/13/2008,"Meh. Not bad. But, I agree with Julia W that the Natick Collection somewhat sucks a lot, so I don't head out here much. But, I've never experienced a crazy long wait, and the food has been consistently tasty. Also make us of the 15-minute parking spaces to run in and grab some cheesecake to go, with was a bonus. If only they made a sampler cake..."
Ellen C.,"New York, NY",153,168,,2.0,12/6/2008,"I think this is one of the most over-rated restaurants.  For some reason everyone always gets incredibly excited to go, but the service is slow, the food isn't that great, and it's rather pricey for what it is. I've had the lettuce chicken wraps, and the spring rolls. Generally I'd say the appetizers are better than the main courses (which are overwhelmingly large in my opinion). Of course, the cheesecake is still tasty, but lots of places have tasty cheesecake. Or just go in and buy a slice. Not worth eating at the restaurant for the price."
