Nina S.,"Framingham, MA",0,10,,2.0,6/13/2016,I love the Cheesecake Factory. But today my service was particularly horrible. I came with my mother and friend at 6:30 and it took an hour for our food to come. The food was good but than it was another 20 min before we got the check. My mom didn't see that he gave us the wrong the check. The check he gave us $121 and the one we were supposed to have was $50. Someone else came over and fixed it but than he took another 30 min to bring our cheesecake to go. Overall it may have just been a bad waiter but they were not that busy and it took way too long.
Ada L.,"Los Angeles, CA",1955,596,998,3.0,4/1/2012,"This was a typical Cheesecake Factory. There's usually a huge selection of food to choose from, but now that they have the SkinnyLicious menu, I don't take as long to order my food. I initially ordered the SkinnyLicious Herb Crusted Salmon, but the waitress came back 5 minutes later to tell me that the restaurant doesn't have anymore salmon. It was only 8pm, so I was disappointed that they ran out of salmon already. However, the waitress suggested the Seared Tuna Tataki Salad, which I ended up enjoying. The ahi tuna was a little overcooked, but I really liked the wasabi vinaigrette that came with it. I normally feel guilty eating at the Cheesecake Factory, but this time I actually didn't feel bad. I was pretty full after eating my entire entree, so I ordered the Kahlua Cocoa Coffee Cheesecake to go. When I got around to eating it, it tasted yummy as expected. When it was time to pay the check, some other waitress grabbed my bill and charged the wrong amount...not sure how that happened since the total amount was printed right on the check."
Jessica C.,"Statesboro, GA",27,364,39,2.0,3/10/2014,"Got to restaurant at 1:05, seated at 1:40, waiter took so long with our drinks that we missed brunch! We were given brunch menus and told we had until 2 to order- bummer. I had the chopped salad and they failed to include avocado- so- for 12 dollars I had a very small salad that was less than appetizing. Now wonder they say it's ""low in calories."""
Krista J.,"Acton, MA",0,5,,2.0,4/26/2015,"I've been to this location many times, and always a fan. My visit yesterday proved me otherwise. Jackie, our server, was great! Food wise - not good, not bad. My eggrolls were scorched, and not in the best way. The alfredo was SO SALTY. I chose not to send it back (time constrictions), but still wouldn't feed it to my dog. The chocolate mousse cheesecake...certainly not to die for this time. I couldn't finish it. I was pretty bummed that I spent $80 for the quality of food I ordered...less than an hour after you opened. I would have paid less than $25 for that entire meal, definitely not worth the value.  Now here's the part that would prevent me from ever coming again - my sixth month old son needed a diaper change. I walked into the bathroom to find that there was no changing table in the stalls. I don't think I saw a ""family bathroom"", and I didn't have time to search for this changing table, as my little guy NEEDED to be changed asap. So I did so on the bathroom floor (in a stall) and what do you know, he shit right up his back. Lots of it. All over his onesie. Unfortunately, I left his spare clothes in our car, parked on the other side of the mall. No time to run all the way over there. So, diaper changed, poop-covered onesie stored in the bag, and the little man is shirtless and dressed in his pants - thank god I had a blanket at our table to swaddle him in. And what do I hear on my walk back to the table? A group of servers walking past me, and in the background ""Why doesn't that baby have a shirt on?"".  Note to management: inform your servers that making comments about your customers, whether they are in the restaurant, just walked by, or just left...IS NOT APPROPRIATE! Somebody will always hear you, not to mention the amount of disrespect that goes along with it.  Good luck to that server when she has a kid and forgets to pack diapers in the diaper bag, or runs out of formula when she has a hungry, screaming baby, or can't sleep for weeks straight when her child is teething. Keep your comments to yourself as a server in a popular, constantly busy franchise restaurant."
Gabi R.,"Washington, DC",283,31,6,5.0,11/23/2015,"amazing :) friendly service and amazing food with giant portions! enough to take back to the fridge and enjoy the next day or for a midnight snack.  but also, obviously the cheesecake is amazing. Love the Lime and the lemon merengue. Absolutely delicious"
Joe S.,"Marlborough, MA",0,165,,1.0,4/3/2015,"Wife asks if she can get a chicken dish that she likes made WITHOUT mushrooms and is told ""no problem"". Done this before with no issues.  My dish comes and the waitress tells us that the chef cooked my wife's dish with mushrooms and that the manager's on the way. Manager tells us the same story and says it will only be few minutes as they are already making another one without mushrooms like we asked, but as he finishes the sentence another guy brings over my wife's ""freshly cooked dish"". Seems awfully fast but what do we know. Well, within few seconds it was rather clear that the mushrooms were simply picked out and this is not a freshly cooked dish like the manager claimed.  Didn't have the time to deal with this useless manager and simply took my wife's dish and gave her mine chicken romano. The problem is that she's allergic to mushrooms. Not sure if this is some new manager but here's a hint... honesty is the best policy."
Lilla F.,"West Roxbury, MA",1,10,3,1.0,3/5/2015,We always dine in the chestnut hill location... But today we were at the mall do we dined here after all aren't all the cheescake factories the same...well today I learned they are not!! We ordered everything we always order in chestnut hill only to be disppointed everytime. The white bread served in the basket was hard as a rock when we asked the waiter for fresh bread he said that's the new artisan bread and that's how it is.. And we insisted that he was wrong soo he went back and brought fresh soft bread.  I ordered my usually Renee's special chicken salad sandwich only to be left in disappointment... The chicken salad was drenched in mayo the portion was tiny (nothing compared to chestnut hill) the Mexican chicken soup was tasteless .. Tasted like plain water with just beans n tortillas in it mind you the waiter told me it was spicy ... Ha nowhere close!! The barbecue ranch chicken salad was nothing barely there! Bottom line their portion sizes are tiny and their food absolutely tasteless. Total let down for our favorite place to eat! This location in natick is highly not recommended! Never again!!
Amar S.,"Newton, MA",2,13,2,1.0,10/18/2013,"Average food and horrible service. Me and my wife went there for a light dinner as we already had a late lunch. We were greeted by Emily who immediately sized us down. She asked us if we wanted any drinks we said no thanks we would like some iced water. Emily disappeared! She never came back and instead a very polite Hispanic gentleman in her place apologizing for her absence and said that he was now our server. Really unclassy, Just because we were not a party of 10 people and we didn't order a bottle of wine does not mean we don't get good service.  I'm sure the management knows this they just don't want to do anything about it, shame on you CF"
Greta K.,"Worcester, MA",210,400,79,4.0,7/18/2013,"Normally, I don't care for too many chains but I look forward to going to the Cheesecake Factory about twice a year. And I have to say they have a nice and often uncrowded brunch on the weekends. I've been many times but my favorite experience was going here in the fall and eating my entire serving of Eggs Benedict (they have huge portions, but I was pregnant at the time).  I recently went on a weeknight at 8:30 and there was not wait (thank goodness). We munched on the bread before our orders were taken and let me say that the dark brown bread is really good. I want to take some home with me every time!  My normal choice is either a salad or a sandwich. The entrees are a little pricey (though again, the portions are quite large). Their salads are really good but I chose some kind of Southwestern/Californian chicken sandwich with avocado on a crusty Italian bread with sweet potato fries. Honestly, this sandwich was pretty good and no, I didn't eat the whole thing and brought half home to my husband.  When cheesecake is on the dessert menu, I don't usually order it except here at it's namesake. I've had several different kinds here- the original with strawberries, the red velvet cake, the tuxedo, the dulce de leche, the chocolate mousse, the brownie, the Godiva, etc. However, I really think they should have a dessert choice that features small slices of a few kinds (maybe three) in addition to a huge slice of just one flavor. Maybe CF could choose their most popular flavors or the customer could choose. I want to try everything and have small plates like tapas everywhere! At this location, I've never had a bad waiter/waitress and the restaurant and bathrooms are always spotless. I like the outdoor seating, too."
Renny W.,"Waltham, MA",4,21,,4.0,7/1/2013,"I've eaten at Cheesecake Factories all over this beautiful country, but I only recently decided to eat at the one in my own backyard. The restaurant itself is very large, almost cavernous, with lots of seating and great ambience. I felt like I was in a roman palace! (I was dining by myself, and they still generously offered me a nice large table and seat). However, this place is a tad too popular. The parking is a nightmare. I almost got run over on the way in. Nothing was going to keep me from those delicious smells coming from inside. My waiter was a helpful little guy. I've never seen a waiter so passionate about his menu. He was actually making me a little uncomfortable with his excitement. I started with some delicious appetizers: Roadside Sliders, Avocado Egg-rolls, Fried Mac n Cheese and Crab Cakes. ALL VERY GOOD. I especially want to give a shout out to the Avocado Egg-rolls (I wanted to try more selections). For my entree, I ordered the Steak Diane. Pretty good, but I thought the steak could have been juicer. I should have got the Fillet Mignon... I was feeling pretty full and told the waiter (little devil) that I would probably be skipping desert. He INSISTED on showing the ""desert demo"". A nice way of tempting the customer. How could I resist? So I ate a Red Velvet Cake Cheesecake while I was there. YUM! I also ordered the Key Lime Cheesecake and the White Chocolate Caramel Macadamia Nut Cheesecake to go. I had intended to eat the cakes the next day, but the temptation took over me and I ended up eating one on the way home and one later that night on the couch. I paid for it all night long... trust me. I really wish the waiter had just respected my wishes and not tempted me into buying desert. They are losing a star for that reason."
Katie C.,"Boston, MA",180,587,92,4.0,9/8/2013,"The Cheesecake Factory at the Natick Mall is my go-to lunch/dinner spot when I am at the mall shopping.  Since I can easily spend a day shopping, I work up quite and appetite so it's always nice to be able to sit and enjoy a bite while taking a break.   This location is always busy and there is practically always a wait.  The menu is expansive and there's something for just about everyone.  Unfortunately, the CF has a bad rap based on portion sizes and nutritional information that's not public.  Cheesecake, in general, is nowhere near ""healthy"" so it should come as no surprise that you can do some serious damage to your waistline here. I digress.  I typically have no problem snagging a seat at the bar and ordering food.  The bartenders and extremely efficient, friendly, and polite to all customers regardless of whether or not you order booze.  If you want a Diet Coke and order an appetizer, you are treated with the same amount of respect as if you ordered a bottle of wine and a steak dinner.   My personal favorite is the Skinnylicious Mexican Chicken Lettuce Wraps that are served in bib cup lettuce ""bowls"".  It's messy to eat, but the salsa has a significant kick to it (me gusta!) and overall, it's a great meal and plenty for just one person.  And it's under $10 so it's totally reasonable. The food is consistent, the service is always pleasant, and I'd rather eat here than the Met whenever I am in Natick and don't feel like venturing past the mall."
Dallas M.,"Framingham, MA",0,2,,1.0,2/2/2016,"If I could give this place negative 5 stars I would! Went here with my girlfriend and our waited was absolutely horrendous. I'm a server myself so this was surprising. He went to our table a total of two times and was obviously pissed we only wanted dessert. He proceeded to roll his eyes and walk away. He brought us dessert and then left for 15 minutes. When he came back we were finished, our plates were empty. He then went to the three tables surrounding us and walked past us a total of 12 times without seeing if we were done!!!! He disappeared for another 10 minutes so we had to flag down someone else to get the check. He came back and asked if we needed anything else ( my dessert was half done ) and didn't bother seeing if we wanted it packed up. His name was Ronny C. Worst service I've ever had by far. Won't be returning. Thanks Ronny. Definitely deserved the 5% tip I left...."
Caitlen G.,"Marlborough, MA",5,23,4,4.0,6/11/2015,"I never knew food was served at the cheesecake factory. .I just thought it was just cheesecake. Oh how wrong I was! The menu is extensive and has a variety of options that could please even the pickiest eater! There's something from every food group- burgers, tacos, steak, seafood, pizza, spicy, etc. The portions are large and staff is attentive. Take the cheesecake home if you are too full because it is to die for!! I'm sorry I didn't try it sooner...."
Amanda D.,"Marlborough, MA",9,6,,1.0,1/18/2015,Worst service ever!!! If you end up having Ashley H as a waitress you might as well just leave! She forgot to take half the tables drink orders and ignored us for the rest of the night. We ended up just ordering an app and leaving.
Bill R.,"Ypsilanti, MI",4,82,7,2.0,9/16/2013,"I don't get it what is there to like about this place. It's always PACKED and for what overpriced mediocre food served up with a side of attitude. The ladies love it though, I get dragged in there every time and I have to take any sharp objects off the table in fear that I might put something in my eye just too leave. Its the same experience every time. So you sit down and you get a book put in front of you that is a menu and then you sit there for a half hour trying to decide want you want on such a vast menu... don't worry though they have Ads in there menu to keep you entertainment when you get tired of reading. Then you order yourself a nice girly drink that has barely any alcohol in it. The wait staff in the mean time doesn't help because anyone I have had thinks there stuff don't stink because they work at such a place of dignity and class like cheesecake factory. Anyways they get one star for the cheesecake because it is all I ever look forward to and the fact they have a pretty decent brunch."
Pamela A.,"Windsor, Canada",7,3,,5.0,12/2/2014,"While in Vegas this May my sister and I ate here in Caesar's excellent service, fast, but the meal's served had to be my favorite the price was great as well. Will absolutely make it a point to eat there again. *I had the chicken salad avacado sandwich served with fries"" my sister had the shrimp and a noodle cream sauce"". Thank you Cheesecake Factory!!!!!"
Jason Z.,"Worcester, MA",18,41,8,3.0,2/15/2015,"Typical chain restaurant, with a pretty big menu that covers everything from Chinese to Italian. Good spot for families dinner and appears to be a hangout place for high school students. The foods are standard, not too bad, not too good. The cheesecakes are great.  CAUTION: People with allergy make sure your waiter/waitress understand what you are allergic to. Our waitress was completely clueless about allergy. After my girlfriend (gluten intolerance) asked the waitress to make sure her gluten-free pasta to be cooked in a different container, the waitress told my girlfriend there is no need to cook pasta in different container because the water boil off the gluten (This is not true)."
Steve B.,"Shrewsbury, MA",0,39,6,5.0,6/4/2013,"GO FOR HAPPY HOUR 4:00- 6:00 M-F Most appetizers are $5 each (some are $6.25) and they are typical portions...which are huge in comparison to other restaurants. The apps were delicious, service was great and friendly. Typically I hate the Cheesecake Factory because there is always a wait and it's expensive. If you get there during Happy Hour it's dead and 4 man-sized appetizers for like $22"
Catie C.,"Quincy, MA",114,582,2257,2.0,5/13/2009,"Parking is hellish here. Better off parking at the other side of the mall then walk thru the mall to get there.  I always wondered about the concept of HUGE dishes. Obviously, CF is known for it. I wish they had normal portions for us people that try to eat healthy portions! Course, one can agree that I can just take leftovers home. However, I'm one of those that never eat leftovers then it just rots in the fridge. I usually only go to CF when I know someone is going to finish my food or take it home.  I ordered the Luau Salad which was like a mountain of greens! When I was done, it really looked like i didn't eat any of it. I love the salad; but it can easily be 3-4 meals for me!  For a mall restaurant, I found it odd that they don't have children's menu. I always wondered why I see kids have huge plates of food in front of them every time I eat there. My 2 nephews (3 & 5) ended up sharing chicken tenders that was not finished. Another odd policy is that they don't provide kid's cup for water, only for paid beverages. Luckily, my nephews had their drinking cups with the car. Else there would be water all over the table!"
S G.,"Holliston, MA",5,172,14,3.0,1/7/2015,Overrated. I don't understand the popularity of this restaurant. It should stick to cheesecake as that's the best thing on the menu. This place in constantly packed the to be honest the food is overpriced and just ok.  The menu is way to large and often time serves are so busy you don't get that personal dinning experience that most diners want. Honorable mention the hibachi steak.
