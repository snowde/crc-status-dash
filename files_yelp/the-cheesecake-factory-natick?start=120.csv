David G.,"Boston, MA",33,144,,2.0,1/11/2013,"I had the misfortune of going to the one at the Natick Mall about a week ago. Why do girls love this place? Is it the gianormous menu of girl drinks? That they are always attached to a mall? I tried to offer other suggestions but she locked onto it like a pitbull. Sigh. Whoa, hello $100 lunch tab for processed, formula derived food. If Trader Joe's met McD, it's offspring would be the Cheesecake Factory. How many calories in those giant mediocre cheesecake deserts? 3,000?"
Marilyn L.,"Boston, MA",0,4,,3.0,1/15/2016,"The place and people were nice and friendly, but the food was not. I ordered shrimp and steak(median cook) combo, only got 3 shrimps and the steak was over cooked. My boy friend's steak was also over cooked and super salty! Avocado egg roll were not as good as usual."
Jennifer C.,"Boston, MA",6,118,,3.0,1/19/2014,"I have to start out by saying that I am really not a Cheesecake Factory fan. At all. The food is...meh.. and the prices are kinda high. But, I had brunch here today for the first time and it was pleasantly better than I expected.  I had the eggs benedict, which was yummy. Lots of hollandaise sauce though (but I love it!). The potatoes on the side were crispy and delicious. My friend had the everything pizza and it was also quite good. We shared the Smore's Cheesecake, which was rich, but very good. This one is definitely for chocolate lovers as as it is very rich. We mostly got it because Cheesecake Factory was donating 20% (I think)  to a food charity for every piece sold. I liked the marshmallow and whipped cream the best. Service was fine. Nothing to write home about, but polite enough. Solid 3 stars today."
Deanna S.,"Newton, MA",5,28,,1.0,8/23/2014,"We have been CF fans for years but this was the first time eating at the Natick location. I ordered the chicken and biscuits(without onions) and yep it came slathered in tiny onions. I took one bite of the chicken and it was so overcooked. The waiter never checked in so we asked a different waiter to send over a manager. He was very nice and took my meal off the bill, I would never eat it covered in onions. My husband got a grilled pork chop and it was so small. CF has gone downhill the past few years and this was the last time dining at any location."
Ashley S.,"Pawtucket, RI",0,3,,1.0,2/11/2016,"I traveled a hour to this Cheesecake Factory, it was my first time ever going. Worst service. Host did not even say hello just brought us to a table. We had a server Kelly A. and she was not friendly, rude to say the least. When it came time for the bill we had paid with a gift-card and the rest on a card she did not open the book but saw two cards, the expression on her face looked disgusted and she said "" oh so you are splitting the bill "". She made us feel very uncomfortable since that was not the case we paid together. First time and had horrible service."
Juan D.,"Boston, MA",0,3,,4.0,11/16/2014,Place is always busy and typically have a wait.... BUT the bar area is first come first served so always be on the look out for one  tables if you don't like waiting.
D. M.,"Southborough, MA",0,4,,3.0,7/12/2014,"We were having a nice dinner, when some guy comes walking in with his dog!  I love dogs, but not at or near my table yipping at everything! Cheesecake Factory has gone to the dogs! :("
S O.,"Boston, MA",6,85,37,2.0,7/23/2014,The service was good but the food was mediocre. The bread was not fresh. The taco tortillas tasted like paper. I love the use of avocado but they need to pick it up in the spice department.
Elizabeth G.,"Framingham, MA",0,19,,3.0,4/27/2014,"A mixed bag. Something that baffles me about the Cheesecake Factory is how long the lines are on weekends. You could have up to a 2-hour wait. I mean, the Cheesecake's food is all right, but to me it's not worth waiting 2 hours (or even an hour) for. There seems to be a lot of hoopla about the Cheesecake Factory in general, and I kinda don't get why. Maybe it's because--to their credit--they have a menu option for everyone. Vegetarian, heavy meal, light meal, meat, fish, salads, you name it.  Their Sunday brunch is great--in fact, if you don't want to wait forever to get a table, I'd suggest going here for Sunday brunch before the Natick Mall opens, have your brunch, and then go shopping. Beat the rush. If you get a booth here during busy hours, you're in luck. The booth seating is great for conversation and provides a buffer from the restaurant (when the restaurant's going full-tilt, it gets pretty noisy and chaotic). On the other hand, if you get one of the tables in the middle of dining area during busy hours, you'll be yelling at your dining companions and competing with the conversations from neighboring tables.  The food is average to average-plus. I've tried a lot of different things on their menu, and my favorite lunch/dinner dish is the Tomato Basil Pasta. Soooooo good, and it makes for delicious leftovers. In the winter, I like Chicken & Biscuits. Also good is the Grilled Chicken & Avocado Club sandwich and Lemon-Herb Roasted Chicken."
Christeen S.,"Dedham, MA",0,4,,2.0,1/15/2014,"If the drinks weren't DELISH they'd have gotten 0 stars.  I got the bang bang chix. Not that good. It was fine. But really CCF, $18?????   Our waitress asked if we were all set with the skinny menu....really? Wow.  She's lucky I was with my husband who allowed me to tip her after a comment like that.    We come here once in a while but this visit sealed the done deal.  Too expensive and the food us just not that good."
TinoX T.,"Boston, MA",47,484,123,3.0,10/6/2014,"I'm a Big Fan,Nice Food,Clean place,Awesome survice with any Branch you Visit."
Joanna S.,"Pasadena, CA",0,20,,1.0,12/30/2015,I ordered some chicken and biscuit; DISGUSTING. waitress also didnt even give me one refill of my coke. But yea the food here tastes old and stale. Not worth it.
Michelle C.,"Gardner, MA",7,1,,4.0,10/26/2014,My husband and I finally went here for the first time for dinner on a busy Saturday night. It was only 45 minutes for a table at 7:15. Service was great. Some drinks are very pricey at $10 to $12 a glass. My husband and I both had beers at half those prices. He ordered the chicken maderia and loved it. I ordered the crusted chicken romano. I did not care too much for the spaghetti and sauce. There are so many choices. Coffee was great and so was Linda's Fudge Cake. That was the best chocolate cake. There is enough for 2. I would go here just for it. Space is tight so it's good to be thin. I had leftovers and my husband did not. Mine was great the next day. We will probably return. It is outside our area and we usually cook. I will probably go back to their menu for inspiration.
Marc S.,"Milford, MA",3,35,26,5.0,8/17/2014,This place is awesome! Everything on the menu is too good and too much for you to eat. You can't go wrong. If it's crazy busy ... sit at the bar. The staff is perfection.
tony e.,"Marlborough, MA",40,24,28,4.0,7/5/2014,My wife and I had dinner tonight at the Cheescake factory.  Service was good and the food was great.  Our Waiter Ronny C. was outstanding and very attentive to our needs.  We will be back.  Manager was closely looking over the operation of the restaurant.
J C.,"Boston, MA",1,37,9,4.0,5/12/2013,"The Cheesecake Factory in Natick was awesome! The customer service is great and the food delicious. The environment was has a nice vibe and while waiting at the bar for a table to be available was great. They had a large variety of cocktail drinks, and the list of appetizers was to die for. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to everyone.  Have fun and enjoy."
J H.,"Natick, MA",0,5,,1.0,3/29/2015,"Have not eaten at a Cheesecake in almost a year.  I had the Cream of Chicken Soup with no Chicken in it at all. Not that big of a deal for a starter.  I moved on to the Jambalaya which was bad.  Half of the meal is made with linguini pasta that was mushy from being overcooked. I basically ate the toppings.  I thought I couldn't go wrong with the signature Fresh Strawberry Cheesecake, again, wrong.  It tasted like it was 3 days old.  It is to bad.  This location is terrible, hands down."
Lebna M.,"Cambridge, MA",0,19,1,1.0,4/18/2016,"I had a terrible experience in your bar and with the way your manager at the location of 1245 Worcester St, Natick, MA 01760 handled the matter. I recently visited Cheesecake factory on a second date. It was the worst that I could have done! We sat at the bar because the wait was very long. We ordered a modified appetizer that didn't come out right but whatever we dealt with it. We put in an order for some food I put in a salad in which I specified I needed it modified and no wontons etc. and date got his normal meal. When My food arrived the salad was no where near modified. it came just as it was on the menu me being a vegetarian I sent it back and asked for it to please be modified as I asked for it if it was possible. they left my dates food. and we waited for my salad. his food got colder and colder. finally my salad arrives. It comes with meat and no dressing on the side at all. I just looked at my date and said ok now what. The bartenders are mumbling to themselves and looking and annoyed when I tell them I am so sorry but there's meat on the salad I cant eat it that way. They start complaining to the servers about me to the point the servers from the service bar start looking my way it was embarrassing. Never mind the fact that the manager comes over and he SCOLDS ME!!! for having to the salad over again! I don't know which one was worst! he tells me he doesn't want to make it again if its not gonna be right. This is 10 minutes after my salad has already gone back to the kitchen so I am thinkin they are already working on the new one. But the manager tall skinny guy talked to me in such a horrible manner I just said to him nicely. Don't worry if the salad is not being made  ill just grab something somewhere else or later no big deal. He says okay ill check the kitchen. Comes back 10 minutes later I am thinkin he has my salad. NOPEEEE he comes to tell me oh the kitchen never started your salad so we just didn't make it again okay! I was like okkaaayyyy!!! I have never felt treated so disrespectful and embarrassed by your staff never mind management.."
H P.,"Wellesley Hills, MA",2,77,,2.0,1/12/2014,"Well I must say this is a very popular place at least on a Saturday.I like to go weekdays but I had given my daughter an Xmas gift certificate to the Cheesecake Factory and unbeknown to me she had given me the same gift certificate .My daughter has kids that go to school so it had to be Sat .I suggested 5pm before the crowds arrived ,but the crowds had arrived ,in fact a 50 min wait and they told me to come back for a vibrator in 1/2 hour because they were out.I must say The Cheesecake Factory is not concerned with your comfort as you wait with only about 8 seats to sit.Plenty of space at the bar though.I had eaten here about a year ago and found the menu was extensive .The service was good and my wife ordered Shrimp Primavera while I ordered a combination dish ,Encrusted Salmon & Steak Diane .While we were waiting for the meal my wife & I ordered Lemonade ,very sour and expensive too $4.50.The food came out and my wife's dish looked good but she complained that the shrimp was not as fresh as she had at Captain Marden's in Wellesley 2 days ago ,which was a lot cheaper than here .My dinner the Encrusted Salmon was just ok ,however the Steak Diane  was so stringy through and through ,I could barely chew it . Recently I'm finding it's so hard to find a decent Filet Mignon that is not stringy ,chewy.I reviewed the Capital Grille recently and ordered a $62 steak ,potatoes and greens extra,which was very stringy ,downright robbery to charge for a bad meal .Since this restaurant is named The Cheese Factory ,we ordered cheesecake .We cringed at the price $7.95 for a slice .The cheesecake was quite good and filling ,but not worth the price .You can go to Trader Joes and buy an 8"" New York cheesecake as good as any I have ever had for around $8 .So looking around the crowd was thinning out .I was not so happy with the meal ,in fact it was very ordinary .It's attraction, I think they cater to every whim ,my daughter had a Club Sandwich and salad my grand kids had Hamburgers .All in all a very ordinary meal for what we went through to get seated ,just not worth it . I wont be back ,but I said to my wife ,give them an ordinary meal ,over charge ,serve the meal in a nice place which it is ,and they will come ,not me ,I've had it."
Taco E.,"Framingham, MA",5,63,5,3.0,3/14/2012,"I am a fan of this Cheesecake Factory although I do have one big complaint: the water. It is chlorinated (aka TOILET WATER) and just plain disgusting. I like to have a water when I order an alcoholic beverage and this place just doesn't do it for me. You'd think they'd have decent water by how 'fancy' the place seems. Everything else is great, I would just stay away from the water. I warned ya! Other than that, the alcoholic beverages are fantastic and always good, the food is GREAT, always consistent, always huge portions; although the menu is way too big and I often find myself and others taking forever to decide on what to get. The cheesecake is amazing..I always get the carrot cake cheesecake but have had others and they are all yummy. Appetizers are really really great as well; I recommend the buffalo blasts, nachos, mac and cheese balls, and the asian potstickers. The parking situation is not ideal and I usually have to end up parking at the mall, unless I am there during later hours. The wait time is usually 30-40 min if you have a group, unless you're there at dinner time, it could be much longer then. I recommend going after 8:30 pm or noon-earlier to miss the rush. If you only have 2-3 people you are seated quickly."
