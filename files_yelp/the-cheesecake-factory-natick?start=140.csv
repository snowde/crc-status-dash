Haley C.,"Leominster, MA",12,50,19,3.0,9/1/2012,"Huge food selection. Skinnylicious options are okay. I got the Grilled Chicken and it came with three pieces of chicken and a small spoonful of rice! I wish I had maybe 2 pieces of chicken and then more rice. Three pieces of chicken is just WAY to much meat for one plate! That is literally how much chicken I eat in a week! I ate the pineapple upside cheesecake for dessert and it was SOOOO GOOD! I would so get that piece again!  Our waiter was excellent and kept checking on us which was really great. However, when we first got into the restaurant we were told it would be a 5-10 min wait but the Host actually forgot about us and it wasn't till about 20 mins in that he realized he never sat us! He was sitting same sized group people that came in later before us! It was very frustrating. When I went to the restroom and found out how messy and gross it was, also no toliet paper in some of the stalls, i went to bring it to their attention. The four people that were just hanging around the front desk just looked at me like a deer caught in headlights. No one apologized or assured me that they would go correct the issue which was kind of disappointing."
Robyn H.,"Houston, TX",4,80,35,4.0,1/8/2012,"Typical Cheesecake Factory experience. Good service with quick seating and the perfect type of waiter (stops by the table frequently but not too frequently and very helpful with questions and special orders). Drinks were replenished quickly. Food arrived hot and on time. We both ordered the Crusted Chicken Romano and as usual it was perfect. You could cut the chicken with a fork it was so tender. Ordered the tiramisu for desert. Portions are always large with enough for leftovers of both dinner and desert. I will continue to visit the Natick Cheesecake when in the area. Parking is always annoying though, but worth it for the food."
Michael S.,"Franklin, MA",0,6,,4.0,8/31/2014,"Absolutely delicious food always comes out hot and ready to eat! But save room for desert because their cheesecake is absolutly delicious, fresh, and affordable. But you might wan to share cheesecake  because the portion are a Pretty big size. Can't wait to go back!"
Andrew F.,"Peoria, AZ",1,45,7,3.0,5/9/2014,Had the Grande Chicken Burrito. Flavors were ok but what really irked me is that they give you this massive footlong burrito as thick as my forearm and 90-95% of the burrito is stuffed with rice. I really had to dig to find any chicken. So my sisters complained to the waiter for me and they sautéed some additional chicken with onions and peppers. So kudos to the staff for wanting to promptly fix this. The only other problem was that by the time I got it I was basically done. Id go to this Cheesecake Factory again but I probably wouldn't go for the Burrito again.
Stephen C.,"Rochester, MI",11,36,8,3.0,8/20/2012,I like the Cheesecake Factory. Although you will never feel good  about yourself after eating there. All of the food is very heavy -- even the salads!  The cheesecake is awesome. I can't say I can vouch for any of the other items on the menu. I have never been amazed by any entree dish here.  Expect to wait at least 20 minutes anytime you go. It is also a very noisy restaurant which can be frusterating. The best time to come here is after 11:00PM -- the kitchen is still open and you don't have to deal with the noise or the wait.
Cameron H.,"Boston, MA",62,126,15,3.0,10/29/2011,"As is the case with most chain restaurants, this place is about average. Given its location (Natick Mall) it's perpetually busy - expect a half hour wait at the very least, regardless of day or time. Parking is a nightmare, and their pagers have anemic reception at best, meaning you have to stay within ears shot anyways. Food is about what you'd expect, decent, but certainly not noteworthy. Tastes like it was prepared in bulk from supplies that came from a distribution center, as I'm sure is the case. It's better than some other chain restaurants (not going to name names) but still unimpressive. Seemed rather expensive for the quality as well, although portions were generous. Last time I visited, a Friday night, the staff at the reception desk were actually talking at (not to) people as if they were cattle; ushering them around and attempting to herd them. Very demeaning. I left my creditcard there by accident, and when I returned to retrieve it, they asked for no proof that it was mine, just handed it right over. There are certainly better options in the area to dine, especially given the number and variety of choices around."
Punam D.,"London, United Kingdom",134,316,9,3.0,8/26/2013,"The Cheesecake Factory is a very popular chain, and it can normally be relied upon to produce a palatable meal. I have only been to the one at Natick Mall, which is a large. clean space, quite dark, with tables outside too. There is usually a queue, but we were seated tonight immediately as everyone was wanting to sit outside and provide a feast for the mosquitoes! We had their deliciously soft and warm bread before I moved on to the 'Skinnylicious' (""TM"") pasta ragu, which was tasty although a little underseasoned and the other half had the chicken madeira, which he always has and thoroughly enjoys. I did not try the cheesecake today but I'm sure I'll be back and will update the review then. It's a sold 3; nothing special, but completely acceptable fare. Service was good and the house merlot was perfectly quaffable."
Marc E S.,"Cherry Valley, MA",26,24,,4.0,5/23/2011,"When it comes to chains I'm a bit weary as most of them are bad news bears with boring and bland food (i.e. Crapplebees, TGIFridays, Chilis, Pan(t)era Bread, Olive Garden etc). After years of hearing rave reviews, some from people whose opinion I respect I stumbled into one of these to try some of that highly regarded cheesecake. First off the selection of cheesecake is intimidating. If America is all about choice then Cheesecake Factory fully adheres to that motto. They all look like beautifully sculpted pieces of dessert you will be constantly second guessing yourself as to which one to choose. It's almost unnerving how many flavors there are. We opted to sit down and started off with the Cheesecake Factory merlot. It was fantastic. Great flavor and smooth. I know some places like to only pour 3-4 drops of wine in the glass but here they fill it up a little more than halfway.  I ordered the chocolate coconut cream cheesecake and my girlfriend had this monster of a piece of chocolate peanut-butter greatness. Both were amazing. I wish I could have drafted up a contract and leased my mouth out to that cheesecake for 12 months. The price is a little high for a slice but it's well worth it. Our server was on top of his game. He was courteous and very helpful with the cheesecake selection. I even caught him polishing our wine glasses before they were brought out. Oh and it was super busy in there but we were never neglected in any way.  I did not order any food off the menu. Again the food prices are a bit on the high side but I saw dishes being brought out to tables around us and they looked phenomenal with huge portions. Bottom line: A lot of chains can learn a thing or a million things from The Cheesecake Factory as they deserve all the hype they get."
Chris P.,"Hudson, MA",2,26,,2.0,9/2/2012,"I went to the Cheesecake Factory today for the first time. I was curious to see what all the hype was about. I was very underwhelmed.  I ordered the chicken burrito, it should have been called the rice burrito. It was 90% plain white bland rice. It had 1 chicken breast in it, the chicken wasn't seasoned, it was very bland. In the vegetables, they actually served me the skin of the onion, which is inedible.  Our food took a long time to show up. Our waitress was MIA most of the meal. No one followed up with us after our meal was served to ask how it was. It took a long time to finally get out check.  If I had waited a long time to be seated, then experienced this lackluster meal, I would have been at 1 star. I won't be heading back any time soon."
Terry S.,"Lexington, MA",0,13,5,4.0,6/14/2014,"You definitely don't come to the cheesecake factory for short lines and a concise menu, but I've always enjoyed the food here. The cheesecake is always 5 star here, and I'm a big fan of the meatloaf. The prices seem reasonable to me since half my dinner always ends up going home with me and being next day's lunch. You have to save room for dessert, right? The menu is crazy, full of ads, but hey, can't blame them for trying to make a buck I suppose. The service has always been decent here, even if sometimes the kitchen is a bit slow. If you're in the area and want delicious food and don't mind waiting, I recommend Cheesecake Factory."
Caitlin P.,"Somerville, MA",2,12,,4.0,12/5/2014,"Great place, but does NOT take reservations unlike what the yelp page says."
Will P.,"Portsmouth, NH",643,322,1327,1.0,12/6/2011,"Filthy, one of us actually got sick here...the bathrooms were disgusting and several items of trash were left in the aisles while we were there.  Try the one in Boston, if you must.... a real yuckee experience. This should be 0 stars, based on the high price."
Jeremy K.,"Glastonbury, CT",195,799,,3.0,8/7/2009,"3 stars and 2 slips, ok, kidding about that one, topical...  3 stars though, really, not much you cant say about the CF, consistent average, always expensive, remotely interesting. this time we got there after baby was put to bed in what was the second time in six months we were 'babyless' for dinner. yay!!! oh yea, the review. so we got seated within ten minutes, just enough time to go to the american girl store and see all the 1)parents with daughters 2) expecting mothers expecting daughters 3) people that need help perhaps. we fit in category 3.\  so, we were at one of those sucky two tops half bench, one chair. i got chair, which btw, was dirty but then became slidey, like they didnt want me sitting around or something.  mer got a few drinks (a few outrageously expensive cocktail without the buzz to go with them) and i settled on a flat iron steak. why did i get this you ask? beats me, it wasnt super great and the straws were substitute with cakey rings which also kinda sucked.  i doubt we will go back to the CF as there are 14 other places now in the area we can discover before we have to venture back."
Jen K.,"Plainsboro Township, NJ",2,20,20,2.0,4/10/2015,"I will give this a two for the large quantity of food but EH for service. It took a very long time to get our server to pay attention to us. Also when he dropped the food he literally bounced. I wanted some Parmesan cheese on my Louisiana chicken pasta but no where to be found sad . I know it was super busy but still.... I kept looking around for any server, all the servers def could see I needed something but they did not care about meeee and mi parmagianooo :( also after my server dropped off my pasta I looked down and there was no fork... I guess they didn't set the table with forks before it took a while again nobody cared that we needed forks. I finally saw a manager and politely raised my voice ""excuse me can I have a fork?"" Immediately a server seeing that gave us our forks.......... That server was standing there the whole time btw.....when I was looking around for someone~~ the Louisiana chicken wasn't as good as I remembered this time! My BF had the southwest chicken sandwich which was good!! Definitely go when it is not packeddddddddd servers are super rushed and everythingn seems half done"
Russ D.,"Quincy, MA",3,15,11,4.0,3/30/2014,"Food is pretty good as standard for the Cheesecake Factory. Staff are pretty friendly, but it has the typical downside of a Cheesecake Factory with huge waiting times. Last night was light at only 30 minutes, but we showed up at 9:15."
Brandi J.,"Beverly, MA",269,19,13,4.0,5/1/2012,"Kitchen is open  late - which is a huge plus - huge selection - good food & fast service.  Gets busy since its connected to the mall - but, it's worth the wait to be seated... go grab a drink at the bar or keep shopping til your table opens.   Get the lettuce wraps, samosas an fried Mac and cheese yum  :)"
Ran D.,"Worcester, MA",74,229,76,4.0,7/12/2011,"Ok this is gona be a hit to my street cred. It's true maybe when my girl asks to go, I pretend to begrudging accept so I can get to pick next. But lets face it. Every table in here is like a Sex in the City Fan club. So I guess my first tip would be for single guys to check it out, not in a pair our everyone will think your on a date. Not that there is anything wrong with that.   Sooo anyway this place is the perfect example of the way you dine, is just as important as what you order. But coooooome on, you roll in here and order meatloaf and pasta!? you deserve a 2 star experience stupid, not mentioning any names Scott W.   Any place with a menu this big is going to have more holes in it, then the stupid plot of that romantic comedy that your going to be dragged to, after dinner. Here a three tips to a 4 star experience here A) sit at the bar and avoid the line that is here anytime of day the mall is open.  B) get a cocktail, they do a nice job on their drink menu, go on the movie will be a lot better C)Get the apps, instead of a meal and leave room for cheese cake to split. (Nachos & lettus wrap combo, can't beat it, plenty of food for 2-3) If you don't drink, or like to sit at the bar, you've been warned. Next your going to tell me you don't order the cheese cake?"
Rosie D.,"San Francisco, CA",144,50,26,4.0,5/26/2011,"I came to this restaurant on 5/20/2011.  I have been to a variety of cheesecake factory restaurants throughout the country and this one is like any other especially the atmosphere. Our wait time was a bit long, 45 minutes.  But the server made a big difference.  She was fast, prompt and professional.  Our food came out very quickly.  So overall, I am satisfied with this cheese cake factory.  I feel like the experience depends on your server as well as the chef."
Isabelle T.,"Boston, MA",0,17,,2.0,4/21/2015,Great food-servings etc.--But we were there at the high top tables watching one waiter toss the rag used to clean the tables up in the air repeatedly-dropping it most times onto the floor --then cleaning the tables with the dirty rag--even after stepping on it to clean a spill on the floor!...Not appetizing!
Molly M.,"Framingham, MA",0,19,,4.0,8/15/2013,"Been here a few times, first time reviewing, never had a bad experience. Recently went for lunch and we were seated by a nice kid and when I asked if we could be seated somewhere else (instead of crammed in between 2 other tables of diners) he said sure! And put us in a booth.  Our waitress was friendly and attentive and the food was consistent and good. The food always seems to be consistent and good, i like their wide range of veg dishes."
