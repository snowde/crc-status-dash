CJ G.,"Grand Isle, VT",131,289,1,2.0,1/27/2011,"Now I have gone too 2 other locations. This one makes it my 3rd. I must say Im not very impressed with the staff here... So we walk in one night after a long night of shopping with the girlfriend. We had a 40 minute wait. So great! Not a problem. We enjoy the food here so we wait it out! We got sat and our waiter comes over to take our order. So everything is going great and we order our drinks and an app. As soon as he leaves my girlfriend leans over to me and tells me that he was winking at her and making faces. Kinda strange. In fact I laughed. So then he comes back and takes our order for dinner. He does the same type of thing. Again I laughed. :P So I ordered the Cajun chicken little's. It came with breaded chicken strips with Cajun on them....Wait it did NOT come with any Cajun on them. There for it was either not made right or the Cajun here is just bad. So I went ahead and was eating it anyways. The sad fact is the potatoes was the best part of my meal. So the meal was nothing more than avg for me. The girlfriend got enchilada. She didn't even finish it.  She ended up not feeling to well after our app for some odd reason. For our app we had fried mac and cheese balls. ALL I can say about these are YUMMY! It was sooo good! It came with four good size cheese balls. After breaking it open you cant help but want more! I highly recommend these! Great for 2 people! So after eating we each had food left and asked for them to be boxed. The server came and boxed them up for us. While he put the bag on the table he makes a small little comment...""I added another bag in there in case you guys part ways tonight."" and at that point I had enough.  I ended up paying our bill of $50.00 or so and left nothing for a tip. the food was fairly priced but the chicken lacked in Cajun badly. So I cant help but to think what went wrong here. My guess is if the server put the effort he put into hitting on the girlfriend maybe it would have been better. I am thinking the food wasn't typed in correctly. Even the girlfriend said she couldn't taste anything Cajun. I left hungry and not to happy I must say.  So at the end of the day the food was poor and the server is a jackass. This is the only bad run in I have had with this chain. So I will continue to go. I will however give this location another go in the future and update the score when I do so. Very poor 2/5"
Kerri O.,"Maynard, MA",255,590,7,2.0,1/6/2011,"I ordered a salad, and still left feeling bloated and horrible.  I ordered off the Lunch Salad Meal option, too. Sweetie got the pork chops, and they were fine, but the mashed taters were so full of butter they were a weapon of Mass Destruction on their own. Caveat:  we went here because Sweetie was given a gift card for Xmas. Back to the Intro: Our reluctant Host was chewing the biggest wad of gum known to mankind when he seated us, reluctantly.  Given the fact I was on crutches, the fact that I was seated WAY in the back was spiteful, considering ALL the empty seats we saw.  Seriously?  That's in the Cheesecake Handbook? Seated by the Kitchen, I got to hear repeatedly the exhortations of someone going ""C'mon c'mon, Cahm ONNNNN!""   Why?  The place was almost empty.  There's no way the kitchen was backed up, why scream like that?  And, I've worked almost every post in a kitchen, unless you have NO idea or control, you shouldn't have to resort to screaming. I will say our server was perfect.  I hope he graduates to Sel De Terre, and gets the meals, and kitchen he deserves. He was great."
Scott W.,"Maynard, MA",6,74,,2.0,7/10/2011,"I'd like to love the Factory, I really would...but it just ain't happening. The cheesecake is killer.  That's the only reason I give two stars.  The rest of the menu is fair at best...quantity over quality here, folks.  The highlights of my meal tonight were my brother-in-law's BADLY undercooked rice, my meatloaf gravy that was about 3 times as thick as it needed to be, and my wife's pasta that'd been drowned in oil. This is one of those places that sounds like a great idea when someone first mentions it...and then you go...and regret it immediately. Pass."
J F.,"Brooklyn, NY",22,31,3,2.0,1/6/2011,HARRUMPH!  I am seriously confused by this menu. I get that people want lots of options but I am hesitant to trust a restaurant that does Tex-Mex and Asian dishes.  After looking over Crime & Punishment (Menu Edition) I realized that I was getting shafted on vegetarian menu options. They didn't even have a veggie burger. Even Chilis have a veggie burger!  I opted to get the grilled cheese sandwich that turned out to be pretty disappointing.  To sum up my reasons for someone to go here: The bread is pretty good?  The portions are big?  Free drink refills?
Andrea H.,"Chicago, IL",366,474,138,1.0,12/27/2008,"Congratulations Natick Cheesecake Factory...for being the only one, out of the many CFs I've been to, to make me violently ill.  Seriously, I love CF, but this one was all wrong.  I mean, really, how do you screw up lettuce wraps?  2/5 of us ended up regretting our visit for the rest of the night...and we ordered different entrees. Oh, and our server didn't write anything down so that's probably why he forgot most everything we ordered.  Way to go."
Suzanne T.,"North Attleboro, MA",24,100,5,3.0,11/5/2013,Had lunch better with my daughter. I ordered a burger and it was well done. I ordered it medium rare. Other dishes are good here but the burgers. I'll come back but I'll get pasta next time.
nathan t.,"Waltham, MA",12,7,,4.0,5/14/2011,"First off, I wanted to say that while I've often looked at reviews on yelp, I've never been moved to actually write one.  My girlfriend and I have been around the Boston area for some time, so we've made it a bit of a habit to try a large variety of things in the area.  A lot of great places, and on occasion some mediocre or poor ones.  We elected to take my girlfriends mother here for mother's day after work a week ago (on mothers day, so I was not surprised to see it busy as usual).  It was nice - a nicely decorated place with good food, and comfortable.   The wait was pretty much expected.  Hey, when you go to the Cheesecake factory, you know they are going to be busy, and you deal with it.  Considering the number of other people waiting, I'd say they are quite organized in finding everyone a table as promptly as possible.  I will admit - I often do not trust restaurants with huge menus.  When restaurants try to be everything to everyone, they often do not manage to do a great job on any of them.  Cheesecake has proven me wrong on this.  Whenever I have been to the Cheesecake, I always get something different.  From pasta,, to stteak, to salads, burgers, fish, asian inspired - whatever - you name it.  I have never been dis-satisfied with any of the quality , OR the value of the meal.  (I've been to some supposedly great places, and have felt completely cheated!) Back to the story. This time was no exception. G/f got the same dish as always - Penne(not fettuccine)  with chicken and sundried tomatoes.  Her mother had the chicken Madeira, and I had the orange chicken - don't think it was exactly this, maybe one of the newer dishes that's not listed yet online.     We did order an appetizer of off their new ""specials' menu on the recommendation of our server.  cool.  However, when our food appeared later, sans appetizer, we were a little confused.  Also, they had made the g/f's pasta with the default fettuccine, not penne.  We mentioned this to the server before he even put it down, and he promptly apologized and immediately took the pasta back to the kitchen to change it. We were a little annoyed - but hey - it was busy, and a mistake I can understand how they made.  about 5m later, the manager came over, and profusely apologized for the misunderstanding, and truly tried to make up for the mistakes.  He brought my girlfriend a caeser salad immediately, to help the wait more bearable - certainly not expected, and a very genuine gesture.  I was surprised when their very busy kitchen brought out my g/f's pasta less than 8 minutes later.  I was very impressed how quickly they corrected the problem.  And yes, my girlfriend thought it was delicious and she's known to be exceptionally picky, so they certainly did not half-ass it.  Our original server came back, apologized herself for the miscommunication, and offered us desert on the house to make up for it.  Again - not really expected, and certainly a gesture that we sincerely appreciated that they were truly trying to make things better.  We each got dessert, (I had the pina colada, girlfriend had some peanut butter / chocolate monstrosity, and her mother the key lime cheesecake with mango - all were very good).  So - to sum it up.  Busy.  Food certainly met or exceeded all of our expectations.  Some issues, that were promptly and honestly addressed by the restaurant (which I think they deserve a lot of credit for).  As before, I'll certainly be returning again sometime.  The only reason why I gave a 4, is because I've been to some very amazing places, that the cheesecake simply can't compete with, given the pricepoint and market they are serving.  However, against their peers, I would say they are a top notch and well run organization, for a large scale american chain.  And I've been *extremely* impressed by their continual high quality over time - something that seems to decline rapidly after the first year of a new chain opening, and they try to minimize costs / improve profits once they have solidified a return customer base. Overall - great place to go for lunch or dinner, especially when you're looking for something nice without being pretentious.  Seems to be a pretty fitting choice for many occasions (admittedly maybe not all)."
Saurabh M.,"Shrewsbury, MA",30,7,2,2.0,11/24/2010,I was there last night with my sister and family from jersey. The stewardess sucked big time. She was lost confused and rude(sometimes). We are vegans and hence had to settle for something similar like lettuce wrap and avacado egg role. The portions were huge and we liked it. But there was a lot delay in servings and the reorder for breads made us talk to the other stewardess.  Anyway my sister dint like it. And we had to settle for cheese cake 'coz p f chang had more waiting.
William F.,"Maynard, MA",2,12,,2.0,4/5/2011,"Everyone loves the Cheesecake Factory.  Honestly, this place is a sham. As other members have said, the CF tries to portray an upscale image when in fact it is a casual dining destination.  There is always a line, no matter what time of day you go, not to mention the food is mediocre at best. The service is alright. I would go elsewhere if I was picking."
Ryan S.,"Wellesley, MA",10,147,4,4.0,4/24/2013,This restaurant is very consistent. The thing I have discovered is that about an hour after eating here I don't feel so good. I don't know if they add a lot of MSG to the food or sodium in general but it always leaves me feeling very tired and a little nauseous. Also I feel thirsty for about 6 hours after. It is not due to over eating and I feel this way even after having a salad there ( I like the southwest chicken salad). But I keep going back.... Because its good and I like cheesecake
Jenna A.,"Clinton, MA",0,16,,4.0,3/12/2014,"The cheesecake factory is one of our favorite chain restaurants to go to. You get well worth your money considering you always take home leftovers. The drinks are pricey but delicious and good in size. The service is mediocre at this location, but we always return for the yummy food."
Georgina C.,"Boston, MA",381,227,27,5.0,7/12/2011,"This is a great CCF, it is always packed, the service is wonderful, even curbside is incredibly quick! The waiters are always so helpful in making decisions (resulting in my favorite Chicken Madeira). I've been here countless times, on dates, with friends and with family.  I have never been disappointed."
Shah H.,"Milford, MA",0,7,5,2.0,11/12/2013,"Went there to have dinner with my family. My Son turned 8 and he wanted to have a nice dinner at there. We had to wait for 45 min to get a table. The waitress was nice. I ordered their ""Famous"" Cajun Jambalaya Pasta. It was dry, the pasta seems like  was cooked and left in a pan because it was dry. The dish lacked sauce and flavor. The cheese cake was not fresh , even the G&T did not have the tonic  water...the menu is too big, you do a better job if you reduce the # of food items and increase quality."
Jim L.,"Waltham, MA",2,37,,3.0,2/6/2012,"The food is pretty standard for the chain - you don't go to any Cheesecake Factory expecting fine dining, but you also don't expect Applebee's quality. This location fits comfortably in that niche.  The three stars, however, are mostly because the tiny size of the dining room results in ridiculous wait times even during off hours. We went at 4:45 on a Saturday and had a half-hour wait, people arriving soon after us were told 50+ minutes. If you're in Boston and looking to go to a Cheesecake Factory, spare yourself the heartburn and find another location."
Jenna A.,"Clinton, MA",0,10,,4.0,1/13/2015,It sucks that this place is always SO packed but the food is absolutely delicious and everything is made to order and always fresh. My favorite is the cobb salad and the pasta da vinci...delicious!!! The service can often be slow and not the best but the food is what keeps us coming back.
Mario B.,"Sudbury, MA",0,1,,1.0,3/12/2014,"If you have  grandchildren who are hungry , coming  back from  lacrosse or soccer or any games,  and they tell you that  you have to wait for half an hour. . Dont believe them , we have been there on few ocassions and  they have the recurring problems of telling you to wait for x number of minutes and NEVER have been within the promised of waiting time, and if you have these grandchildren who are really very  hungry  and crying, you just have to go  to other restaurants. This experience   I want to share to everybody.     Mario Bucal, MD. Sudbury"
Camille B.,"Marlborough, MA",1,10,,3.0,5/22/2014,"The food is delicious, the drinks are over priced but great, and the cheesecake is phenomenal. BUT it's almost like there is no point going during normal/popular hours because service just tanks and you end up waiting upwards of an hour for food."
Ferdmeister V.,"Beverly Hills, CA",37,135,73,5.0,12/14/2012,Miso Salmon is my favorite here!  This place is located at the Collection so you can't miss it.
Ann F.,"Franklin, MA",33,17,4,1.0,5/13/2012,"This is the only Cheesecake Factory I have ever been to. If they are all as bad as this one, I do not know how they stay in business! I have been here 3 times, each time with a large party(8 people twice, 11 people once). We called and was told they did not take reservations or call ahead seating. Ok, fine. SInce one member of our party was 7 months pregnant and we also had an 18 month old, my husband went ahead to get in line. He was told it was a 90 minute wait, they really didn't have the means to accommodate large parties easily! They had to wait to get three tables together for us. After an hour, when my husband went to check the pager, something was rattling around in it. Thinking it may be broken, he went back to the desk to check. Hewas told it as fine and we had been told 90 minutes and it had only been 70. This was a celebration for my son's college graduation. After another half hour, when we noticed large groups who arrived after us were being called, we checked again. Lo and behold, our pager WAS faulty. Gave us another one and we waited another 15 minutes. Now we have waited over 2 hours and why didn't we leave, you ask? Because it was Saturday night and we had already invested the time. So, on we go to check again...and find out that our table had been given away by accident! The manager kept apologizing and telling us we would be seated in 10 minutes and to pick 4 appetizers for free for as soon as we sat down. We stood in the lobby and waited some more. I see the appetizers come out of the kitchen and we still have not been seated. The appetizers were sent back, but then the manager comes back, with the appetizers while we are standing around waiting and being pushed out of the way by people and says ""why don't you eat these right here while you are waiting?"" At this point, we explode! I have a pregnant woman and toddler who have waited for close to 3 hours and they want us to eat standing up in front of the whole restaurant? The manager was pissed that we refused this. He had also promised a free dessert by way of apology to my graduating son. Well, that never happened either. Overpriced, filthy, horrible customer service, the manager of this particular chain should be ashamed of themselves Because of this store, I will never eat at a Cheesecake Factory ever again. The only bright spot to the evening, was a wonderful server named Stella, who was very attentive. We did tip her of course, but I am a very generous tipper and I am afraid my anger at the manager ended up affecting Stella, which in hindsight, was not fair. But this is what happens. A bad manager affects the whole staff. I will be send ing a copy of this review to corporate. Something has to be done."
Spenser O.,"Eugene, OR",8,100,,4.0,11/28/2010,"I've mentioned I don't frequent the Natick Mall but are there occasionally, and I would give the mall an award for best selection of food and shops if I could.   I love the Cheesecake Factory. In fact, the only thing I don't care for is that it can get VERY busy VERY quick. Which is good, especially going by the saying that every good restaurant will be busy.    If you can get by the occasional long wait, your in for a good time. I love the atmosphere not to mention, just how small you feel in such a large place.    They serve the legacy of Coca-Cola products, and of course alcohol if you please. They also have quite an extensive menu with things like soups to pasta. They will sure have something for 99.99% of the population. And if your the .01% who don't like it I would recommend a comprehensive check of your taste of your taste buds. But hey, come here for a good time and drink anyway.   As the name implies they have great cheesecake, I've had the red velvet cheesecake a few times and recently some kind of Oreo cheesecake. Both were top notch and I would never think of hesitating to get them again.   So, if you can get by the fact of the price and wait your in for a great time!  S.O."
