Ben P.,"Waltham, MA",1,23,,1.0,11/10/2012,"If you need food fast don't go here.  My family put in our reservation with the hostess (they don't take call in reservations) at 6.  She said it would be an hour.  An hour later, it was going to be 10 minutes, and every 10 minutes after that they said it was going to be another 10 minutes and this went on for over another hour until we finally were seated.  In total for an hour wait, we waited 2:15.  I have been here several times, and when they tell you 30 minutes expect a 90 minute wait.  Which tells you two things, (1) the mall rats love this place and pack it in like sardines and (2) you are going to need to wait outside in the rain, snow or shine to actually eat here and expect it to be a lot longer than promised."
Marcy L.,"Douglas, MA",458,550,531,2.0,5/7/2010,"If you've been to one Cheesecake Factory, you've been to them all. It's a big, expensive, flashy Applebee's (but with better cocktails)....  *Clean - I appreciate this in a chain restaurant. High ceilings and creative lighting make you feel like you're in an expensive place...even though you'reeeeee just at the Cheesecake Factory. Nevertheless, cleanliness should be celebrated (there you, go - 2stars).  *My foodie friends have always told me, ""don't trust a place with a menu that looks like a thin novel."" LOTS to choose from (so at least you'll find something for everyone in your party of 15), but I doubt that they will be raving about their dish (how does a kitchen make ALL of those things to exceed expectations???! Concentrate your efforts, perfect your dish, claim your customers by their palate!). I always get the Luau Salad: massive and sweet - but you can't take leftovers home for the next day because the huge crouton disks will have become soggy and tainted the rest of your dish. The Artichoke Dip was disappointing... And I honestly have never tried their cheesecake (I think I was too disgruntled by the end of my experiences be cause the - -  *Service was terrible. In such a big place, your little waiter feet have to move extra-fast in order to keep all patrons satisfied (I can sympathize); our waiter seemed nice...but dim and unresponsive. It took 25 minutes for me to get water and another 15 to get lemon for the water, it took 25 minutes to get the check (after we had finished...and had been checked on by our waiter...and had asked for the check).  *The only thing that really kept my date and I amused was the impressive number of birthdays there were. And every time, a small herd of servers would group around a small slice of cheesecake and sing (with progressively dimming enthusiasm) ""Happy Birthday, from the Cheesecake....Happy Birthday, to you...."" LMAO!  I should have known what I was in for - looking back, ""the Cheesecake"" has always left me wanting more. Hopefully next time I consider visiting this sad, sad food chain, I will remember my past experiences and choose something more satisfying."
Scott C.,"Wellesley, MA",12,178,3,4.0,9/20/2012,"Tried this place again after a few years.  Sat at the window which was a totally different experience.  Away from the crowded, noisy main dining area.  Food/service were as expected for a Cheesecake factory.  Great time."
Stephani D.,"Austin, TX",0,4,,4.0,11/26/2014,Went with my family for a birthday dinner and everything was great! The food the customer service. Will definitely recommend this place!
Shixin Y.,"Worcester, MA",37,5,41,4.0,10/6/2012,"The cake is gorgeous, and I love the shrimp tomato pasta is also fantastic. One disadvantage is that the knife is so dirty that I require the waiter to bring another pair!"
Daniel B.,"Huntington Park, CA",30,137,13,4.0,3/22/2012,Great place and really good cheesecakes.  I consider this a place to go with a big group of people.
Timmy V.,"Wellesley, MA",1,6,,4.0,8/20/2011,"I try to make it here at least once a month, especially on Friday nights.  They have by far the best clam chowder I have ever had and portion sizes fit for a giant.  My girlfriend and I typically split a bowl of chowda and a sandwich and still typically cannot finish it all. The ambiance and feel of the establishment is excellent along with their desert menu that stretches a mile long. Because this place is so popular on Friday and Saturday nights, the wait is what you would expect.  My girlfriend and I show up between 7:00pm and 8:00pm usually and the wait is between 30 and 40 minutes.  Besides the wait, everything is fantastic here.  I highly recommend if you have never been. I give it 4 stars because of the wait times and prices."
Dimitri D.,"Worcester, MA",5,34,,5.0,12/31/2009,"A Review of The Cheesecake Factory. By Dimitri D.  The Cheesecake Factory is a place I wish I knew about a lot less sooner than I did. I've gone there many times in the past 1 -2 years that I've known about it and I've never once been dissatisfied. The Cheesecake factory is a good place for groups because they have an incredible selection that will please everyone in your party's taste buds. The food quality itself is also excellent. I had an exceptionally delicious chicken parmesan sandwich just two days ago (12/29/09) and the fries are fried perfectly. I hate these places that give you half an inch of batter on your fries. Not to mention their very generous with their portions. The wait staff has always been very friendly as well. I've never had poor service, a poor meal, or gone home still hungry from the Cheesecake Factory."
Santhosh J.,"Plano, TX",0,59,6,4.0,9/2/2014,"Surprised that I could finish my dish even after eating bread that was served before the meal... Probably, the portion size has reduced... Still, quantity is filling enough... Ordered the Chicken Madiera, it was very nice... Plating was excellent, the best part was the chicken, it was soft and tender - melted in one's mouth... Overall experience was very good - the place, the decor and the service were all good... Will definitely be back at a CF on my next visit to the United States..."
Al B.,"Natick, MA",0,12,,2.0,8/29/2014,"Good food, but they have cut down on their helpings. Shame on you CF!"
Michelle C.,"Douglas, MA",91,138,41,4.0,3/1/2010,"On the way out of the Collection, Dad and I picked up four entrees to take home for dinner. It was 4:00, and not busy at all. We placed our order at the bakery and it was ready in less than 20 minutes. The young man working take out was very nice, had great knowledge of the menu as I had a few questions (This menu has 250+ dishes, so I was impressed) . After we ordered he went back to the kitchen to wait for our order, and brought it out right when it was ready with the extras we asked for: sourdough and whole wheat breads, butter, utensils & napkins).... The order was 100% correct, out of the 4 entrees we made changes to 3, while not major changes, I appreciate that when I order the Orange Chicken, that it comes without the orange zest they use as a garnish... I just hate biting down on orange rind, and it was left out as requested. We had: Orange Chicken Chicken Piccatta Evelyn's Favorite Pasta Factory Meatloaf Because it was before 5 PM, he offered us ""lunch"" portions of all of the above, which was VERY nice of him to do. The lunch portions are MORE than enough for anyone, and of course a lot less money. I've been in  other CCF's who just give you the more expensive dinner size just to make a little extra $$$ when it comes down to the final bill. I tipped this kid $10 for a job well done. A little over $50.00 for the 4 dishes, and we all have enough leftover for at least one, if not two more meals."
Bostonshopper I.,"Wayland, MA",0,8,,2.0,4/28/2014,"While food was pretty good, our server was really terrible. The manager on duty was very professional handling our complaints which is a plus, however I cannot give it more than 2 stars still."
G G.,"Natick, MA",20,51,13,3.0,12/27/2012,"Recently the wait times after ordering have become unacceptable.  In addition, a few weeks ago we ordered desserts to go after we were done with the meal.  It took forty five minutes to get six slices of cheesecake packed to go and brought back to our table.  Also the pasta davinci has really fatty chicken in it."
Evan M.,"Rockville, MD",0,12,,4.0,5/4/2013,"Like the new skinnylicious menu, have been able to find multiple things.  Only downside is the wait and lack of call ahead.  If you're going with 3 or more, recommend get a pager first then go shopping.  I will say that their estimate was accurate last time I went (75 minutes for 3 people.)"
Chris R.,"Bellingham, MA",8,24,13,5.0,11/12/2011,"The food was excellent.  The service was attentive, polite, and excellent. The atmosphere was great. I don't like giving 5 stars to a chain restaurant but this one deserves it."
Tanmay S.,"Shrewsbury, MA",6,28,16,3.0,10/23/2011,"I am a big  fan of cheesecake factory and every location of theirs brings in a different spice. This place is very close to Natick mall (almost walking distance).You have to take this into consideration because anytime you go in the wait time is 30 minutes or more. In case you go to this place approx. 8PM to 9:30 PM this is the time mall closes and wait time can be anywhere from 50 minutes to 70 minutes. Due to their business need of accommodating more customers at such a crowded location tables are set very close by where you literally can not walk instead you have to sneak in sideways.  If you are planning on a conversational meet...Bad idea.Due to ""Dome Style"" interiors noise level too high and it echos most of the time. In-spite of the rush service is amazing and you will love this place."
Jim S.,"Natick, MA",0,6,,1.0,11/10/2013,"Sunday brunch with my family which included three children 5,2 and three months. Waited 50 minutes for our order and was cold and not prepared properly when delivered. Spoke with the manager (Katie) about our experience and she was more concerned that I was questioning our dining experience rather than trying to fix the problem. We were comped for all but beverages. There was no alcohol included in our order. She never came over during our meal or as we were leaving to see if everything was satisfactory. Awful food and worse customer service. Never again."
Peter R.,"Holden, MA",2,32,,4.0,5/23/2014,Food and service very good. Nicely staffed with plenty of help. Professional atmosphere it's admirable for a chain. Steaks cooked to desired temp and seasoned well. Lost a star because the seating is a little cramped.
annie o.,"Boston, MA",1,10,,4.0,11/5/2011,"I love the Lula Salad!  I love it so much and this is a must have dish for me to order every time when I go!  I love it so much, I order it anyway despite the fact I have some allergic reaction toward to the nuts in the salad....I know I know.  But I just love it so much!  The chicken is always tender, fresh greens, lovely dressing.....I can have it everyday!  Well, I usually order this as my entree because the portion is very large!  I am always stuffed aftering eating it!  As for the service, although on the slow side, I am ok with it since they are always very busy!"
John M.,"Albany, NY",0,35,,4.0,8/15/2012,"I love how they incorporated the ""healthy"" portion in to the menu. I was able to get a burger, salad, and some bread for under 600 calories.  I'd also recommend their chicken wings and taco style items.  The only thing that sucks with all cheesecake factories is that you are SO close to the people next to you, it's almost always a little awkward."
