Alanna G.,"San Diego, CA",2,22,,3.0,3/15/2009,"Went here for ""brunch"" after church around 1pm, parking wasn't fun at all. there was a 30 minute wait. Once we got seated, go our drinks, and got bread to start eating which was really good. After we ordered our food, it didn't take that long to get to the table. The food was hot, and the plates of food were HUGE. I had to take my food home cause I couldn't eat it all there. I personally enjoyed the grilled chicken and avocado club...and was amazing. Only cause it reminded me of being in San Diego, California. Everyone was really nice there, the place was really clean and everyone was a happy fed camper. You should eat there for sure."
Vicki L.,"Woburn, MA",0,15,,2.0,12/22/2011,"I went for the first time to see what all the hype is about. The food I ordered was good. I can say I was overwhelmed by the menu....it was a binded book with 16 pages! Their was also a little side menu that was an additional 3-4 pages, I am all about choices but this place is off the hook! I like having options but I felt this place has way too many-I felt like I was studying for an exam...16 pages...really? Again the food is good. The location is good but the parking sucks! I was there for dinner and the other noteworther thing to mention is the lighting makes it difficult to see/read the menu. I was finally able to go but I won't be racing to make my way back-it was just an okay place."
Bryan R.,"Hartford, CT",101,588,542,2.0,8/5/2011,"It is easy to get swept away by their cheesecake but the experience really falls on it's face a step above dining at Friendly's with twice the attitude.  They must train the wait staff to be rude, to walk around you like you are not even there when you are waiting and to make sure they come back to your table as little as possible.  Despite the army of waiters and waitresses in form fitting white pants, they can't seem to hone in on the quality of service.  Similar to the service and their staff the food is they same, they try to blow you away with quantity not quality, for all things except, ironically, cheese cake.  The menu is a disaster, there are probably close to 300 dishes in the menu but you would never know.  It would take someone about 3 hours to read through that menu and most of the items are just what it is with no description.  I can think of at least 12 different way to make shepherd's pie, which way do you make yours.  The cheesecake is good but a little over priced in my opinion at between $8 and $10 a slice you might as well skip the subpar meal and save what money you can at this place.  Pick up to avoid the limited parking in the mall area, long waits at any time of the day and almost never cleaned tables."
May D.,"Framingham, MA",0,7,,2.0,12/26/2012,"I was disappointed with my first visit to the Cheesecake Factory. While the service was excellent and the portions generous, the food was fairly average and the cheesecake which the restaurant was named for was really bad. I absolutely love cheesecake, but I ended up unable to eat theirs; it was way too sweet. For what you pay, definitely not worth it."
Courtney H.,"Cambridge, MA",6,107,,4.0,3/16/2008,"I haven't eaten at Cheesecake factory in at least 10 years, completely put off by the long waits. It just so happened that the wait was only about a half-hour, so my friend and I decided to give it a try. I ordered a Navajo sandwich, which is grilled chicken and avocado on flatbread. Maybe it's because I never eat sandwiches with mayo these days, but it was delicious! I found the prices reasonable, considering how huge the portions are. I probably won't be back for another 10 years because I can't stand waiting more than a half-hour for food, but I was glad I ate here today."
jen f.,"Washington, DC",116,271,,4.0,1/21/2010,fine place to chug mojitos before catching a screening of Indian Jones 4. also held my own mini seder here.
Christa H.,"Gardner, MA",38,34,,5.0,9/20/2010,"EXCELLENT food!  I've never had a dish I didn't like, and I've tried LOTS of things here.  The cheesecake is exquisite too!  De-lish!"
Michelle H.,"New York, NY",191,496,6,4.0,11/21/2007,"This is the newest Cheesecake Factory in the area.  I think Cheesecake Factory is one the chains that is pretty good about standardization in terms of taste and quality of food.  Service may vary from location to location though.  Service here was better than I've experienced at others.  Been to the Cheesecake at Chestnut Hill.  The wait can be quite long since it's new and it's in a popular mall. Portions are huge (as always) including lunch size salads.  I personally love the eggplant sandwich on the navajo bread.  I love the navajo bread (fried bread).  Deeelliissh!!  I can't find this bread anywhere else, so I always order the same thing. Also, they will cater your order to however you like.  For example, I substitue fries with a green salad.  No extra charge. If you're hungry after walking through the new mall, this is a great place to curb your hunger, but prepared to wait.  They don't take reservations."
William G.,"Natick, MA",0,37,,4.0,7/17/2012,"We went for the 4 to 6 p.m. ""Bar"" menu of $5.00 appetizers.The service was outstanding,and the appetizers delicious.Large portions of perfectly cooked items.Crab Rangoons,Artichoke Hearts,Beef ""sliders"",and the very best Fried Mac and Cheese anywhere.Everything was terrific,you can't beat it,for the price.The drinks are overpriced,but they went very well with the appetizers."
Dillon E.,"Shrewsbury, MA",1,6,,4.0,9/14/2012,"After my visit at Illustria Salon & Spa across rt. 9, my husband met me at the Cheesecake Factory for the first time. The food was amazing & the cheesecake was to die for! I am already dying to go back the only reason I gave them 4 stars was because the menu is so long! So I had trouble deciding what to get & my server wasn't much help!"
Kristin L.,"Brighton, MA",3,8,,1.0,9/18/2010,"Email I sent to corporate headquarters: My boyfriend and I ate dinner this evening at the Natick, MA Cheesecake Factory.  I ordered the chicken salad sandwich (which I typically order).  I was halfway done with my sandwich when I noticed I was chewing on a piece of hair.  I pulled out of my mouth not a single strand, but a clump of hair reminiscent to something I would pull out of my bathroom drain.  I have never, ever been so disgusted in my entire life.  Our waiter was very apologetic and the manager apologized as well.  They both offered me something else, but I was grossed out and my stomach was turning so I declined their offer.  The manager explained that the chicken salad is made in the restaurant and that she alerted the kitchen manager and he was checking the entire chicken salad stock.  I just can't understand how a balled up clump of hair landed in the chicken salad, mixed in with the chicken and mayonnaise.  Was the chicken salad dropped on the floor and then scooped up off the floor and put back into the chicken salad supply?  Did it come from the bottom of a mop?  These are questions my boyfriend and I are asking.  I am begging you to please oversee your restaurants more closely.  I understand that your restaurant chain is very popular and is constantly busy, but having something like is happen is unacceptable.  I would brush off a strand of hair and not  mention to my server if I found a strand in my food, but when there is a clump that is about an inch in length embedded into the food that is sign that corporate headquarters needs to have a tighter reign on the food preparation at their restaurants in order to ensure that the consumers at their restaurants are not being put into any type of unhealthy food situation."
R D.,"Framingham, MA",0,3,,4.0,4/22/2012,Can't praise the Cheesecake Factory enough for the new skinnylicious menu - it is such a pleasure to be able to dine out and stay focussed on what is healthy.  The shrimp tacos and the chicken enchiladas are my favorites so far - along with a skinny margarita -- but i will be trying other things soon!
Jeffrey L.,"Andover, MA",1,122,,1.0,8/4/2008,"The general rule is that the smaller the menu, the better the food. That is, a restaurant can truly master a few dishes and keep the limited number of ingredients fresh if the menu is limited. This restaurant prides itself on ignoring such concerns as focusing on a few things and doing them right by offering everything from pizza to spicy cashew chicken to baja chicken tacos. Having been forced to eat here a couple of times, I was able to sample some of the worst corporate translations of italian, chinese, and mexican food.  My experience was enhanced by having to sit near a table where a small child vomited on his dinner plate. After vomiting, however, he didn't leave. They cleaned up his plate and table and they continued eating while the boy sat there looking sickly."
Raymond W.,"Boston, MA",112,526,4,4.0,7/3/2009,"Ah Cheesecake Factory in Boston always means a freshman's birthday in my book as people are too new to the area to have favorites or know of any large restaurants that can serve your entire floor. Luckily, out in suburbia we were able to get a table for 7 on a Saturday night with only a couple minutes of waiting. Started out with an awkward waiter, but helped create some funny moment throughout the meal. Buffalo wings were eaten as well as huge portions of food which would make my father proud. nom nom. Louisiana Chicken pasta hasn't let me down yet."
GLORY L.,"Natick, MA",0,18,,5.0,9/25/2009,"This is a consistently quality food experience. The portions are large,and most leave with a food bag for later! The best salmon entrees are here. The salads are huge and so good. They are available in a luncheon size,also huge. The best times are off hours when there is no waiting.  The bread is excellent. Service is good!"
k s.,"Sudbury, MA",0,29,,4.0,7/28/2011,"Good ambience, gernally helpful service but its always a hassle to get in and kinda slow. Food is good (fattening but good!) but the cheesecake is a must get. I got a red velvet cake with white chocolate, so good! and the Chocolate oreo mudslide cheesecake is delicious!!! And the carrot cake. to die for!!!"
Ellen L.,"Shrewsbury, MA",34,241,,3.0,1/24/2008,"This cheesecake factory is pretty much as consistent in taste of food as any other cheesecake.  I have to say that I've never had to wait too long for a seat here, but the one thing that gets to me is that they don't take reservations (even if it's a large party).  I always have my fixed few things that I get here, but I have been meaning to try the meatloaf, which i saw on the food channel as being their ""signature"" dish.  Anywho, the waitstaff are very nice, but i've noticed some are not well versed.  One of the guys at the cheesecake counter was very nice and gave me a good recommendation for a peanut butter/chocolate type cheesecake.  I'm not usually a big fan of those flavors, but when I went to pick some up for my bf, i was torn between two choices.  Turns out that i picked up the one that was recommended and my bf who doesn't usually like cheesecake, looooved it!"
Aaron W.,"Fairfield, CT",24,136,59,4.0,9/1/2008,"Haven't been to a Cheesecake Factory in years, but seems like nothing has really changes, except perhaps the volume of the menu. If you can't find anything here I'd be surprised. Portions are huge, prices aren't outrageous, but parking right outside the restaurant can be tough; You mean need to pay the $7 for valet parking. Don't show up starving here either, as the lines and wait can often be long."
Dee H.,"Boston, MA",37,380,1,3.0,3/14/2010,"I have a love-hate relationship with this chain.  The primary reason I can't stay away is because there's always someone in my circle of friends and family who makes a special request to dine here.  Most recently I was here because Mom and Dad had a hankering for their favorites, miso salmon and filet mignon.  So we had the usual 1.5-2 hours long wait for a table to have dinner (boohoo, but we were prepared for the camp out with a bag of apple slices and blueberries for the kids).  Yes, the food was okay good and the portions were generous.  (Hey CF, seeing the huge portions actually make me lose my appetite.)  The cheesecake for dessert was de riguer for my dining companions.  I got to observe all manners of diners, from a couple of cute young couples on a ""big date"", to the large table nearby who took up much of our server's time because each peep there wanted their own individual bill! *sigh*"
GBP G.,"Boston, MA",5,20,,4.0,4/7/2010,"This is a good restaurant. My wife and I frequent this place regularly. The alcohol drinks are not watered down, The food is good, and the service is top notch. I would recommend this restaurant to people. The only thing I would change is the seating and more comfortable booths."
