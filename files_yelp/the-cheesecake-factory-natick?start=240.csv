Dan R.,"Brighton, MA",0,2,,4.0,1/30/2011,Had brunch here on Sunday.  The service is terrific.   Our server was very friendly and helpful and even the food runner refilled our coffees.  The food was delicious and the portions were giant.  A very solid all-around dining experience.
Bill G.,"Natick, MA",0,36,,4.0,1/5/2011,"My Wife and I went for the ""early bird"" Bar menu specials (4 to 6 p.m.).We were seated fast and waited on quickly.The ""drinks"" were very good and we chose four items from the ""$5.00 menu:sliders (4) were hot and delicious,Greek Salad was ample with a good amount of Feta Cheese,Blue Cheese and Pear Pizzettes which were absolutely terrific,and the Corn cakes,my wife's favorite,which was such a large order we took some home.For Dessert ,we had the Chocolate ""Tuxedo"" Cheese cake which was heavenly.As the restaurant started to fill up,service became a little slow,but we didn't care,everything was so good.You can't beat the quality,quantity and value,if you come early, for the Bar Menu items."
kathy s.,"Framingham, MA",0,27,,4.0,6/17/2010,the only off putting thing about this place is that it can be a really long wait for a table. food is always good though
