Michael G.,"Framingham, MA",15,11,,5.0,3/23/2017,"Eat here more than I care to admit but have honestly never had a bad experience. Whether you choose to dine-in, takeout, or curbside they always seem to deliver. Easily my favorite ""chain"" restaurant, and this location never disappoints. Also the bar staff is exceptional!"
Ramya S.,"Framingham, MA",0,37,63,4.0,3/6/2017,"Have been planning to visit this place for a really long time and finally decided to dine in for dinner on a weekend. The place was crowded considering it was a weekend, we had to wait for about 15 mins for our table. There was a huge selection available on their menu, and their specialties menu had some good options too. We ordered avocado egg rolls, stuffed chicken tortillas, and spicy cashew chicken. The quantity was totally sufficient for a party of two. The service was quick, the price was a little above average but the food was absolutely worth it."
Rach R.,"Wakefield, MA",0,13,3,1.0,8/19/2017,I'm honestly dumbfounded. I went to this location with 3 other individuals. ALL OF US had a piece of hair in our food. It was all similar in color and size so it most likely belonged to the chef.
Sparky S.,"Medford, MA",2,40,16,1.0,7/18/2017,"My worst service experience ever at a Cheesecake factory. can't help post this for others to learn from our experience and go in prepared. We were out there to celebrate a birthday and had planned and pre-ordered the cake as a surprise. We came ahead before our dinner and checked with the bakery to make sure our cake was ready. Later we asked our server privately(to maintain the surprise) to bring in the cake at the end of our meal. Now this is what happened: 1). After our appetizers r done, the lady from the bakery comes over to the table asking if we ordered the cake n wanted it to be served. so there goes the surprise down the drain!!.we just stared in shock and said no. I then went to the server n told him about this and all I got was, ""I don't know what the bakery lady was doing at your table""... that's it. not even an apology for ruining our night. 2). next was the service nightmare. Our entrées r here and the server hasn't cleared the empty bread basket, the appetizer dishes, side plates. we just push things around to make room for the entrées. two in the group were sharing a entrée and we mentioned it when we ordered and all he brought was the entree plate. we had to ask twice for him to bring a plate for them to eat from, and then he just got 1!! and had the nerve to joke saying ""we r making him do multiple runs to the table"".... seriously!!! just do your job properly in the first place, so that we don't have to keep reminding you of what needs to be done. we ask him to clear the dirty side plates, still no action. just walks away. Towards the end of the meal, the server comes over and asks if he could take our plates out of the way, this is while we were still working through our meal! we asked him to clear the appetizer dishes which were still on the table. he said ok and walked away as if ""it's not my job"". when he later came to clear the dishes, we told him to clear the table before he brought the cake(now that there is no surprise with the cake, we could just tell him what he should have known n done in general). he still left the dirty appetizer side plates on the table. we reminded him again when he was walking by...just an ok, no action. After 15mins of wait, he then just brought the cake n we had to make room pushing the dirty dishes to the side of the table while they sang the birthday song.he tossed some new side plates for us to share the cake, we had to ask him again to bring some spoons!! r we supposed to dig in with our hands!? we again asked him to clear the dirty appetizer dishes, all he did was pick one and leave. he comes around in few mins, tosses an empty cake box and the check. ...did we ask for the check?NO!! coz we were still working on the cake on our plates. anyways, we paid our check, left a tip. noticed that they did not add the price of the cake, thought maybe they were making up for their goof-up and it was on the house. courtesy sake we asked to confirm n learnt that this was not the case. an argument ensured between the server and the bakery on who was supposed to charge the cake to the check. finally paid for the cake at the counter. mentioned to the server again on how disappointed we were that they ruined our surprise n all we got was ""you know that mistakes happen"". Yes, we know!! but doesn't one appolgize for it!! anyways we left without asking for a manager (who was never to be seen anywhere when all this happened), we didn't want to stick around anymore n further ruin the birthday for the person in the group. Seriously the worst service I ever saw. will still go to other cheesecake factories....but never ever to the one at Natick Mall!!"
Summer P.,"Natick, MA",0,12,6,2.0,8/13/2017,"Totally disappointing lunch. First I'd like to say the greeters and our server were top notch. That's where my positives end. Our table was in the back by the bathrooms (which were very clean) which is cool, they were busy, but the sparkling water glass (wine glass) was filthy, there was a hair on my napkin, crumbs (not ours) on an appetizer plate, and the whole time there were fruit flies or gnats flying around our heads, it was super distracting. I ordered the veggie burger, and kids Mac n cheese for my kid (I didn't eat anything else so I won't comment on the rest). The ""burger"" was a patty of flavorless rice mush. Of which I took one bite (sans the mcdonalds-esq dyed pickles I couldn't stomach the look of them), I have never had such a bland mushy veggie burger. I get it, it's veggies and rice, but even if I could do the mush, there was zero flavor.  I was very disappointed it fell far far below my expectations of a lunch plate.  I didn't eat it so it was comped, unfortunately I was starving so my mood was a negative 11. The child's Mac n cheese was very bland and greasy, I stirred and stirred and couldn't get any ""cheese"" to stick to the noodles. Poor kid forced herself a bite, then I tried it and completely understood her aversion, again zero flavor, not even a salty flavor, no cheese flavor, it was kind of ridiculous. We got up and went next door to wait while the rest of our party finished (sandwich and salad) which they seemed ok with, eating half of (no to-go containers so obviously it wasn't delish). The water tasted funny. This place has really let its standards slip. We contemplated the cheesecake but I was sort of disheartened by the whole experience and just wanted to be done. You know when you spend all morning running errands and you just want a yummy lunch? Yeah that's all I wanted. I hate to nitpick but omg I was so sad I left hungry, it used to be such a great place. Kudos for not charging me for the ""burger"", but 2/4 meals edible isn't exactly a good enough record for me to come again. Our server was a peach though, above standard service on her end (why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1)!"
Daryl F.,"Framingham, MA",0,1,,5.0,2/19/2017,"We just left dinner which was amazing, but the real star of the show was our waiter Timmy! He made sure we were all happy and satisfied. Not only that but he supplied enough giggles for a week. Next time we go back for a girls night I pray he'll be our waiter. Thanks Timmy! We love you! :)"
Anthony H.,"Largo, FL",113,164,224,1.0,3/11/2016,"HOLY SMOKES! I have to say, I've always heard excellent things about the Cheesecake Factory. Some good friends of mine eat at TCF often. Leonard, Howard, Sheldon, and Raj. So I figured as I love cheese cake and the place gets a bit of publicity from The Big Bang Theory. I would give it a shot! As a major yelper it slipped my mind to even look them up before we went. Boy I wish I had checked it out. So let me just give an entire meal and post meal summary. So it started out after the love and I's trip to Natick Mall we were super excited to go to the Cheesecake Factory. I love cheesecake... Like LOVE cheesecake. So after our shopping bout we ended up at our lunch destination. Our waiter was relatively nice. He was prompt with refilling drinks which was nice, but that was all for nothing when he would grab my half full cup without saying a word and run off at lightning speed. Okay so cut him some slack he's just doing his job. But when comes back to give my drink back he just runs off, even though I tell him thank you he doesn't acknowledge that I even said it. ( Its extremely important to note that I don't say thank you for personal gain or for better service. I have the utmost respect for waiters and waitresses and I know from experience that a simple thank you can turn a day around). That much I can look past when it comes to reviewing an restaurant. The food is really what matters the most.  So I guess the part you've been waiting for. When I tell you about the food poisoning I got. So our food came out and it looked very good and well presented. Which was expected as this place was a little on the pricier side. My lovely lady got herself some steak tacos. Everything appeared to be already pre cooked and really just thrown together from the fridge or something and heated up a bit. Which was extremely disappointing. Me on the other hand. My Fish and Chips lunch looked very good. I remember a few bites in saying I wasn't so sure about this fish. God I wish I was more sure and had it returned because I then spent almost a full 24 hours after that throwing up every hour on the hour with the most vigorous case of the runs happening simultaneously. Now I suppose this could of been a super stomach bug. But with the way things went down it seemed doubtful. I don't generally get sick often and keep my body and tip top working order.. So yeah I was disappointed... OH LOOK, HERE COMES SOME MORE. If you're from the Worcester area you'll get that reference: love business TV commercial. Anyways... Onto the cheesecake. As mentioned I love cheesecake and wow was I NOT BLOWN AWAY AT ALL. This was the worst cheesecake I've ever had in my life. It was Lukewarm and falling apart. I'm honestly blown away by the whole experience as I've been talking about coming here for years solely for my love of cheesecake. So needless to say I had quite an experience. Take from this review what you will. Heed the warning."
Zack R.,"Farmington, NH",9,1,,5.0,7/23/2017,The waiter by the name of Tim A. Was the best and nicest waiters I've ever had and it was my sisters birthday and brought a piece of cheesecake and sang for her and we said don't worry about it and he did it anyways. My parents gave a tip 2x more than any waiter we've ever had. Definitely want to go back
Gina C.,"Natick, MA",79,49,8,5.0,2/10/2016,"Why all the Cheesecake Hate?!  We love this place. If it's out of your budget, don't go here. We go a few times a year, and have never left dissatisfied. The buffalo chicken blasts are our go to appetizer and are so delicious. My favorite meal is actually an appetizer- fire roasted artichoke, you get 3 halves and 2 sauces to dip in which are so yummy it's insane. I wish I could recreate this dish at home, I'd eat it daily! If you like artichoke at all, go here, and ORDER THIS! IT is soooo good!  Oh, and the cheesecake list is extensive and I haven't eaten a single one I wish I hadn't. And I've tried quite a few different ones."
Michael S.,"Natick, MA",2,101,56,4.0,5/10/2017,"My family and I eat here for dinner typically every few months. We all love the food and the huge size of the portions, On the one hand it is pretty pricey but when you consider that most dinners result in carryout and a meal for the next day it is not bad. Cajun pasta is one of my favorites and the family loves the big salads."
Brian S.,"Ashland, MA",40,56,55,5.0,4/10/2016,"I've never had a bad experience at The Cheesecake Factory in general, and this is the second time I've been to this location. As expected, food was fantastic and plentiful. A wonderful place for both a first date or a seventeenth date!"
Panuwat H.,"Framingham, MA",0,1,4,1.0,7/14/2016,"just got off work and my pregnancy wife wants a cheesecake,  I was there 15 mins before closed, I understand they are closing soon, so I try to hurry up order my cheesecake. But they just walked by me, like I'm a ghost. After 6,7 mins standing in front of the cheesecake, I asked can I just order to go, she told me I can go to the bar and see will they take my order. ridiculous!!!"
Raven K.,"Westborough, MA",0,51,,5.0,8/13/2016,Every time I come here the food is amazing and the staff is so friendly you can't go wrong coming here you'll love it!!!! I highly recommend the snickers cheesecake!
Erin N.,"Southborough, MA",5,79,153,2.0,3/16/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory is a place we don't come to very often but when we do it's always very good. There's always a long wait, once we waited almost 3 hours but it was worth it to us because the food is so good. But after tonight we won't be returning. My boyfriend got the original burger medium well and I got the kids mini corn dogs (they took them off as appetizers). My boyfriends burger was way over done, ""asked for medium well got charcoal"" he said. My corndogs were undercooked the batter was still liquid on one of them and the fries were gross and chewy (I never turn down fries). We didn't even get cheesecake we wanted to leave so bad. We will not be returning."
Mister T.,"Natick, MA",11,439,,1.0,12/15/2015,"This place is awful. We came here because we were out of options on a monday and hungry.  We had to wait for a table which was fine, once we were seated the real waiting began.  We were given water quickly, everything else was slow and painful.  The bread and actual drinks took longer than they should have.  Our waiter finally took our order and we waited roughly 35 minutes for the first dish to arrive. We had a party of 6, but they decided it would be wise to bring each meal separate.  Once 5 meals were there, they told us they had an issue with the last dish, it would be another 15 minutes. This was done by the manager which was nice, not the waiter who made the error. The waiter actually tried to avoid our table likely because he didn't want to share the bad news. The service was really awful which was too bad.  The food is never great here but you know what to expect, a massive menu with large portions and ok food at best. Likely never going back based on the service alone."
Maggie W.,"Brookline, MA",17,147,247,4.0,1/25/2016,What can you say about the Cheesecake Factory? They are always consistent. You can rarely be disappointed because you walk in knowing what to expect... to the T. The food is consistently good (although not great) and service is on point. I usually get one of their pastas either the chicken marsala or pasta da vinci. The pasta is always cooked perfectly and the chicken is always juicy. Other honorable mentions would be the chicken littles or the avocado egg rolls. I am never disappointed. The best part of all is the cheesecakes! They are all so good! BUT THE BEST IS THE CHOCOLATE TRUFFLE CAKE. It is my favorite chocolate cake!
Patrick B.,"Framingham, MA",40,28,19,4.0,8/25/2016,"They never disappoint you and so simple to over indulge.  Parking can be a bitch as it is in a mall. Get here early so you can fight the teens and the cinema crowd.  The ""skinny"" menu is quite different from the main menu and in some ways cheaper too.  Had the turkey burger, wasn't too bad.  Fresh sweet potato fries hit the spot as well. Strawberry shortcake for dessert"
Sarah C.,"Worcester, MA",216,373,211,4.0,1/4/2013,"Oh glorious clog my heart and stuff me like a pig cheesecake factory I do love you.... I don't care what anyone says I will admit my love for you.  I know lots of people talk bad about this place and how bad the food is for you and so on... but if you know that and choose to go here every once in a while what is the big deal? It's not like this is my nightly or even weekly or monthly dinner spot... The menu here is insane making it extremely hard to chose what you want.  I have never had a dish from this location that I didn't like or that didn't come with enough food on to feed my whole table. They have really great appetizers.  The buffalo blasts are the best thing on the menu.  I love the chicken romano, meatloaf and so on.  I think that even though they have a huge menu the items always seem fresh and tasty. They make really good drinks here... a bit pricey but oh so worth it.  I love their mojitos and for brunch one Sunday the bartender made me an awesome peach bellini on the rocks. I don't usually actually come here for the cheesecake but it is pretty good.  I would recommend one of their actual cake slices over the cheesecake. Parking is a nightmare.. $7 for valet ... I wouldn't do it anywhere else but here because I want to enjoy my night out and not start out stressed and pulling my hair out! Oh yeah... be prepared to wait usually at least an hour any time around lunch or busy dinner nights!!"
Shreya S.,"Natick, MA",24,37,,2.0,8/26/2015,"What a terrible service. Highly disappointed with the waitress she acted kind of racist and was terribly slow.  We got our breads after the appetizers..thanks to the lady for her extremely slow service and no attention. She failed to interact ,to greet ,to serve on time. However the food was good. So the waitress pull down 4 star to 2 star"
Sara S.,"Roslindale, Boston, MA",0,2,,1.0,1/23/2017,"I normally don't take the time out of my day to write a review. Today I was just a tiny bit bothered. I walked into the restaurant and went to the pick up area the employees name was Ronny C he was on the phone so I stepped to the side so he wouldn't feel rushed  and be able to finish what he was doing. With that Ronny C did not bother to just give me any type of jester to let me know he would be with me shortly. No big deal! As I waited another man walked in and Ronny C had just wrapped up his phone call looked over to me then immediately asked the man how could he help him today? That to me was a little confusing, Being that I was there first and waiting. Yet again I waited. When the man was done I moved in front of the counter. A woman walked and in started to place her order Ronny C not intervene she realized it and stopped self then said for me to go ahead.Ronny C then took my name and found my order. He said its $16.00 I handed a 20 dollar bill to him. My $4.00 change he placed in on the side of the register and went along to service the women. I stopped him and said with customer service you are never to put someone's money that placed money into your hand on the table it's very rude and very disrespectful. He was shocked! I hope from this someone will help you properly turn that attitude you have around. I know everyday is not a great day but you work in a place that welcomes all types of people. Be positive everything gets better!"
