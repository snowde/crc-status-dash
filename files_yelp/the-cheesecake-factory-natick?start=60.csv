Anthony M.,"Leominster, MA",122,216,246,2.0,11/4/2015,"First time I stopped in s few years ago, the portions were huge, checked in on a Monday and they scaled down on everything, but raised the prices. If you can overlook the Gody decor and stuffy atmosphere then come here for the delicious cheesecake. I have no desire to go back for I don't wear uggs or own a north face jacket."
P. M. W.,"Ambler, PA",26,215,,4.0,7/3/2016,"We did take-out curbside.  The place is always packed with almost no parking available.  Which brings me to my first complaint:  The curbside take-away.  People park in the designated spaces and eat in the restaurant.  No one is towed (that we know-of) so the take-out ease is not there.  We finally found a space open and parked.  When I placed the order they didn't tell me I had to call them to let them know I was there.  I figured it out (I'm smart!) and they promptly brought-out the food.  Food was great, packed well.  But only two half-loaves of bread for five entrees ordered costing $120??  (And we asked for the bread)  Oh well.  We don't need the carbs."
Will S.,"Hopkinton, MA",1,14,10,4.0,2/6/2016,"Great Cheesecake Factory location. As with most, bad service or food is rare and they are quick to fix any bad food. Expect a small wait most days, but they usually are accurate with wait times.  Great ""go to"" when you or someone in your group can't decide what they want."
Jesse D.,"Caribou, ME",95,345,149,4.0,1/17/2016,"Their appetizers are phenomenal, I would honestly make the trip into Natick from Worcester just for Cheesecake Factory (and have). I somehow have made it this far in my life without trying their cheesecake which is one of the few regrets I have. Their pasta primavera is excellent. The dipping sauce for the tex mex eggrolls should probably be investigated by the DEA because it's so addictive.  While certainly not a complaint their menu is a bit intimidating since they have so very many options and so far they're all pretty great!"
Lauren G.,"Boston, MA",198,27,2,2.0,5/6/2016,Menu is huge so there is something for everyone. There is always a wait. We sat at the bar and waited for 10 minutes for one of the two bartenders to get our drink order. They were extremely busy making drinks for the entire restaurant so they had a hard time giving the customers at the bar good service. I would suggest that they put another bartender on so people aren't waiting forever for a drink.
Brian F.,"Boston, MA",0,14,13,4.0,2/3/2016,"This a good chain restaurant. The server was very friendly and attentive. The Parmesan crusted chicken was cooked very well, and the vegetables were delicious! My girlfriend got the roasted chicken and she really liked it. The cheesecake we got (pb cup with butterfingers bits) was just ok. There are better cheesecake options. Overall, it was a good meal."
Kate S.,"Marlborough, MA",24,3,,3.0,1/22/2017,"Cheese cake factory is my favorite restaurant but when I call the other day .. the lady that answered the phone wasn't polite and just wanted to get of the phone clearly she wasn't having a good day but anyways, I asked her do u take reservations and she said no but yelp says u guys do and I have been going to Cheesecake Factory for years and I have made reservation in the past so i would the answer bc to be honest I would to make one for February 12th or Valentine's Day can someone tell me if the cheesecake takes reservations"
Alex S.,"Needham Heights, MA",0,45,,3.0,1/11/2017,"Went there yesterday.  The food was still good, the waits were still long but overall worth it.  The only issue was with casadillas that we ordered.  They're made with chicken, peppers and maybe onions but my wife's vegetarian, so she wanted a vegetarian version of it.  Well, what they do is they simply remove the chicken and don't add anything else.  So what you get is tortillas with cheese and barely anything else on the inside.  She opened them up and there was maybe one piece of pepper and onion in each.  What was also annoying was when we asked for them to go they threw out all the side stuff...guacamole, pico de gayo, etc.  Why would they do that??  Make sure to check your to-go boxes or pack them yourselves."
John J.,"Worcester, MA",0,2,,5.0,12/31/2015,"Everything was great, we started with the avocado rolls. If you have not had these, you should have these as soon as possible. For our main course we had the four cheese pasta with chicken and the Southern fried catfish. The catfish was not what I expected, but the four cheese pasta was delicious and I would highly recommend it. Our server was named Tim. He was very busy, however he provided exceptional service and was very attentive.  The atmosphere however could use improvement. It was very warm (hot), and very very very dark. We needed our cellphone flashlights in order to read the menu. The music was loud and distasteful, and was the low point of our visit.  Overall, on par with our expectations of the Cheesecake Factory."
Taryn S.,"Boston, MA",48,23,,4.0,1/15/2015,"Hi! my name is Emiko and i am one of Ms.Taryn's 3rd grade  student's. In my opinion, The Cheesecake Factory is an amazing restaurant. To start, they have a good menu with lots of choices to choose from. Secondly, it doesn't take a long time for the food to come. For example, have you ever gone to a restaurant and the food takes forever to come? Well every time I've been to The Cheesecake Factory, that didn't happen to me. Another reason I like The Cheesecake Factory is because they have great seating and will seat you in no time. Finally, they have amazing cheesecake that has creamy tastes and many cheesecakes to choose from. That's why I think The Cheesecake Factory is an amazing restaurant."
Nicole B.,"Boston, MA",254,286,288,2.0,6/21/2015,"This Cheesecake location is not the best that I've tried, so I'm reviewing it in comparison with other Cheesecake Factories. Our food was good, the guacamole appetizer was extremely fresh and my shrimp tacos were tasty for the ""skinnylicious menu."" However, the service wasn't great. Our servers were very nice, but we didn't receive bread when it was requested and our servers didn't clear our appetizer plate while we were eating dinner. I've seen other Cheesecake Factories crank out quick and efficient meals when there was double the amount of people dining."
Barbara S.,"Lido Beach, NY",0,144,872,4.0,8/29/2015,"Seated quickly. That was a plus. Loved the colorful and eye-catching interior design (do something most people don't do: look up at the great ceiling designs!). Service was fine. Food was nicely plated, filling, and affordable. Even for midday (on a Saturday, though), the bar was hopping. The noise level is really high. Perfect break from shopping at the nearby, very busy mall."
Jennifer R.,"Marlborough, MA",1,11,,1.0,4/15/2015,What a disappointment!! Maybe my expectations were too high since it was my birthday. The host couldn't have cared less that we were even there. He seemed put out that he had to interact with us.  It wasn't busy for a Tuesday night when we went but we had to wait for everything. We were seated in a reasonable amount of time at the tiniest table and the booths and larger tables were vacant. He was easily agitated when you asked to be seated somewhere else.  We waited and waited for everything to come out! Really slow service and I gave up on ordering a second drink even thought we spent 2 hours there.  Crusted Chicken Romano was barely cooked however the Thai Lettuce Wraps are fantastic! I decided that it wasn't worth waiting for the waiter to come back and ask if we wanted dessert so we asked for the check and left.  We go here for special occasions only but we won't be any longer. It's too expensive to get such lousy service!
Melly W.,"Central Manchester, CT",64,105,47,4.0,6/14/2015,"Aside from a very talkative waiter who threw out our ticket (slowing down our order tremendously..) we had a very good meal. We split the avocado eggrolls (a must-have) and ordered seperate entrees:  a lunch salad and the salmon special of the day. All were delciious - perhaps the eggrolls and the sald most of all.  A few asides:  The decor here needs an overall - it's bit much. Trippy, very 90s, and overdone. The bathroom also was a mess, which I let the staff know about. Otherwise everything was good."
Skye G.,"Boston, MA",170,755,1748,3.0,3/31/2012,"I am not a huge fan of the Cheesecake Factory but I went with friends and was surprised at how much I really enjoyed the Grilled Chicken Tostada Salad. Their salads are huge and when it first arrived I figured I'd take some home for later but I ended up polishing off the entire plate. The also have a SkinnyLicious menu to pick from. The one thing I really didn't like was the book size menu.  It was very overwhelming to look at.  On one hand it made picking harder but on the other hand if you want options they are many. Parking at the mall and out in front is always tough.  I usually give up and park in the garage and walk rather than circling the lot. As for the actual cheesecake, they have many flavors and options but again I've never been a fan so I...who love dessert....skipped it."
Russell R.,"Framingham, MA",0,80,94,3.0,10/27/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory has always been very good, but it seems to be settling for just ""average"" nowadays. The food was lackluster and tasteless. Service wasn't bad but the wait time from order to food on table is usually 30-45 min. Wish it was more consistently good."
Benjamin E.,"Brookline, MA",12,67,33,3.0,9/16/2014,"The CF is one of my favorite places to go to.  I have been to all their locations in MA and I have been very pleased with most of them.  However, this being my first time at the Natick location, I was kind of let down.  The service was good and very friendly, but the food was just not up to par ....Maybe it is just this location....or maybe it was just a bad day.  The pasta seems mooshi and over cooked.  The sauce also had a funny after taste to it.  Just not up to the normal standards that I expect from CF.  The Cheesecake for dessert was delicious as always.  I got the original NY style cheesecake with the strawberries. Nice big sweet strawberry and creamy cheesecake."
Jeffrey R.,"Natick, MA",4,41,52,4.0,7/12/2015,"Great place but usually difficult to get seated quick.  Lucked out - busy, but 5 minutes from check in to sitting."
Jess D.,"Farmington, ME",50,12,1,1.0,8/6/2016,"I was super disappointed a few days ago when my husband and I took my one year old there for dinner. I'm 8 1/2 months pregnant and just wanted a nice dinner out with my family before our new bundle arrived. We went on a night where it wasn't busy but our waiter still seemed to want to rush and brush us off.  He took mine and my husbands drink order and then tried to rush off before I got a chance to tell him my daughter would also like a drink! When we ordered our food I told him I have a gluten allergy, I wanted a gluten free burger cooked medium and fries, simple right? Wrong. He said ""a burger with blue cheese?"" Um no just a regular burger with regular cheese and a gluten free bun. When all our food finally came my burger was not on a gluten free bun, it was sent back and I was told a new one would take less than 10 min. Even the manager came over and apologized and asked if I'd like a salad in the meantime, I declined. More than 10 minutes passes, my husband and daughter are both finished with their meal, mind you my one year old was being exceptionally good but we all know that may not last too long! The waiter came back over and apologized again and said it wouldn't be long so I decided to order my daughter a scoop of vanilla ice cream to keep her happy, well my food finally came and it was WRONG AGAIN!! Wrong burger and it was very rare not medium, if I weren't so pregnant it wouldn't have been as big a deal. I looked at my husband told him I was all set and to get the bill, I wasn't going to make my daughter, who STILL hadn't received her ice cream wait any longer. My pregnancy hormones took over and I had to get up and leave. I told my husband to make sure they didn't charge us for my meal or the ice cream. Well they took my meal off and offered my husband a free piece of cheesecake which he declined because my daughter and I were waiting in the car but they left her ice cream on the bill! Needless to say I left in tears and still hungry! They should have comped our whole meal or offered us a gift card. How do you screw up a burger TWICE?!?!"
Mark C.,"Waltham, MA",38,10,,4.0,4/9/2016,"Place has good food, been several times. My biggest hang up is there is barely any cell service which can be tough when you have a babysitter at home. Would appreciate complimentary wifi to offset the issue!"
