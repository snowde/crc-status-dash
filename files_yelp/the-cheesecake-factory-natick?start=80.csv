Shahidha B.,"Westborough, MA",0,3,,5.0,4/3/2016,Amazing food and desserts. The dynamite shrimp and wonton were awesome. Strawberry lemonade was  yum! Good portions too!
Michelle C.,"Wayland, MA",78,437,3672,1.0,9/11/2011,"Not sure what the hype is about this place....I only go when forced.  The portions are massive & gross, have you seen the burrito?! ick! Parking is annoying, dirty silverware and sticky tables. no thanks!"
Ivana M.,"Brønshøj, Denmark",2,14,30,5.0,3/15/2016,We had the nicest waitress and the food is as always very tasty and portions are huge. Ambient is cosy but noise level a bit high.
Patrick G.,"Upton, MA",15,114,20,5.0,1/12/2015,"I haven't been disappointed with Cheesecake Factory to date. I have been to 3 different locations about 5 times between the three and have always had good luck here. The food is always consistently good and the service has been great at all 3 locations. This past visit, my girlfriend and I got the tai lettuce wraps and the fried avocado egg rolls......both were amazing. The only problem is deciding what to order because there are so many great options here.  Will always dine at Cheesecake Factory. Highly recommended."
Kate L.,"Framingham, MA",112,354,37,2.0,10/13/2014,"As a die hard cheesecake factory fan, I will say I had my first bad experience at a cheesecake.  When we entered we stood right in front of the host while he did some work on the computer and neglected to look up or acknowledge us for a few minutes. The wait was brief but the restroom I used while waiting was a mess. The counter was soaked and I had to check 3 stalls to find one with toilet paper. The restaurant was not nearly busy enough for this to have been the case.  Our server was prompt and knowledgable but 2 of our meals came a few min. before our other two guests' meals, which was bothersome.  Also, I ordered the skinny asian salad and really did not care for it one bit. The typical asian salad is always TO DIE FOR and I figured this would be similar. I left almost my entire plate.  I do love this place and will likely go back, but was very disappointed by this experience."
James J.,"Atlanta, GA",0,23,5,2.0,11/22/2015,"Sat at the bar today in an attempt to grab a nice Sunday lunch. Bar was empty except the two of us, yet no one came to wait on us, or even say hi to us, despite us sitting there for 10-12 min. We are in our 60's and have nutritional needs, so this was even more discouraging for us as we really needed to eat.  We eventually left and let both the bartender and hosts know we were doing so as we walked out.  Once we made our intentions to leave known, THEN they wanted to wait on us. Sorry, too late. Come on, Cheesecake Factory - the reviews for this location are pretty bad, and it's experiences like this that are to blame for it. The staff clearly needs a refresher on how to provide quality customer service."
Stephanie M.,"Groton, MA",0,28,4,1.0,10/19/2015,"This has got to be the worst Cheesecake Factory I have ever been to, and judging by the other comments, a lot of people have had poor experiences as well. My friends and I came to this location last Sunday and we sat with Ronny C who was an absolutely awful server! He was extremely slow in every step of the meal- taking about 10 minutes just to greet us, another 5 to bring us all waters, and at the end of the meal about 10 minutes to bring us our check. We were missing one of our dishes and he didn't even realize it until the end of the meal because he never came back to check on us! I told him just to make sure we weren't charged for the dish and all we got was a pathetic apology. He was just so slow and acted like he didn't even want to be there. Not to mention he never refilled our waters which was absolutely ridiculous. I will never return to this location and neither will my friends. Ronny C should find a job that he enjoys doing because clearly this isn't his calling."
Michael S.,"Natick, MA",0,24,,2.0,11/12/2015,"While the cheesecake is good, most of the actual food isn't much to write home about. We had some of the pasta dishes, but both were fairly bland and uneventful. The same goes for the burgers. Best thing to do is get some cheesecake to go and go to some of the local one-off restaurants for better food."
Mark R.,"Framingham, MA",1,27,,5.0,3/9/2016,"What more can I say. For a place like this to only have 3 stars just goes to show how fast people are to complain. I am in the industry, and I can promise you it doesn't get much better than this restaurant. Yes, can you get more creative food at local places or chef oriented restaurants, yes. But for who they are and as large as they are they consistently do a great job. Quality of food, execution and guest service are always amazing. I hold them to a high standard and for as long as I have been going I can't remember being let down."
Mu2 M.,"Mountain View, CA",2,25,11,2.0,10/23/2014,"Went in with my spouse, for a late wednesday dinner.  Apps of firecracker salmon, while very appealing, salmon wrapped in spinach and deep fried in wrapper was poorly executed and served dripping oil. Soy sauce base had 3 days worth of salt. Red cabbage was passable for the $10 appetizer. Waiter was tired and did not help me choose between the said appetizer and soft corn tortilla tamales.  My dessert spoon had some goop on it! Entree of shrimp scampi and angel hair pasta was pretty good. Giant shrimp. Spouse seemed to enjoy her jambalaya. We skipped dessert. Waiter had a staredown with us after signing off with a 10% tip. Note to management: train your staff for diversity sensitivity. Or dont seat couples dressed for asian drapes and sarees. Its OK we understand..."
Anjha T.,"Ashland, MA",10,57,110,5.0,9/19/2013,"I went the other day for lunch with my boyfriend and we both walked away happy and full.  First we ordered the 'Fried Mac & Cheese', which was just as good as i remembered it being from the time I've had it before. Our waitress was sweet and knowledgable of the items we asked about. We ended up getting the 'Chicken Teriyaki' and the 'Southwest Chicken Sandwich'. Both appetizer and entrees came out hot and quickly after we had ordered. Before we left we got some carrot cake and had some Angry Orchards Hard Cider, all great choices :) Overall we were very pleased with the food, service, and ambiance of the restaurant, we will definitely be back!"
Brooke W.,"Worcester, MA",0,4,2,1.0,5/19/2015,"Tonight I went in for dinner with my boyfriend around 5 PM. Upon our arrival we were completely ignored by the host, who proceeded to work on the computer and leave the desk. After 10 minutes of waiting the host finally approached and told us it would be at least another another 5-10 minute wait for a table. Once we were seated, which by the way is in the corner so no one could see us even though there was plenty of open booths, we were approached by a waiter who informed us that he would be right with us. After 20 minutes of waiting, without water, bread, or any sort of service, we made the decision to leave. At the time we had not even learned the name of our waiter. Before we left though, we watched as other customers who had been seated after us were served.  This was my first time ever dinning at the Cheesecake Factory, while my boyfriend had been a few times before and enjoyed his experience. Needless to say, I am completely disgusted with the service (or lack there of) that we recieved tonight. After tonight, I will never visit any of their establishements. I highly discourage anyone from visting this location and would not recommend this disaster of a restaurant to anyone."
Kathleen H.,"North Tonawanda, NY",7,39,,3.0,10/30/2015,This location was nice and the staff was very attentive. I got the four cheese pasta with chicken and it was good but not great - a big improvement over my last Cheesecake Factory review. I ordered the red velvet cheesecake again and it's still amazing - highly recommend.
R M.,"Natick, MA",0,5,,1.0,8/7/2015,"I have always been a fan of this place. Loved their food, desserts, service ....  However, things have changed over the past couple of years. This location is nasty. Order a cheesecake to go early evening at the counter and take a look inside.  I was pretty disgusted by how dirty the floor, dishes, towels and even the cake counter was.  Never again. Deserves no star."
Haze X.,"New Haven, CT",3,7,,1.0,12/29/2015,"Horrible food! Worst I have ever had for years, they charge you 17 bucks for 3 piece of fried dry and chewy fish. Regret that I didn't read the reviews before I went."
J S.,"Framingham, MA",0,4,,1.0,3/26/2015,"Not a good experience at all!  Emily, our server was rude and acted out by letting us know she was not pleased when we questioned how long it was taking for our food to come to the table.  When our food finally did get to the table it was cold. Chris (we think he was a manager) tried to appease us by offering to remove food from our bill or a gift card ~ we declined both as we will not return ~ not so much bc the food was cold but because of the horrible experience we had with the lack of customer service from Emily.   Emily, we are not there to make your job easier or pleasant: we were there to eat and enjoy time with each other, not to be totally disrespected and dismiss by your lack of hospitable service to our table."
Amanda L.,"Los Angeles, CA",117,654,1357,3.0,5/30/2013,"In my opinion Cheesecake Factory has declined somewhat in the last few years. It's still consistent and reliable, but portions are smaller, food seems a little less fresh (maybe some of it is prepared from frozen?), and the overall quality is down. That said, it still is reliable, if cookie-cutter, and you know exactly what you're going to get."
John D.,"Millbury, MA",0,132,,3.0,10/30/2015,Egg roll sampler was good ! The Shepherds pie was fantastic! The Bacon Burgers were good not great too much mayo and whatever mix of sauces on it made it too sloppy and mooshy and the jalapenos were canned not fresh. The sweet potato fries were excellent. Service was good too !
Brandy S.,"Hartford, WI",14,185,165,3.0,3/10/2014,"I've been eating at the Cheesecake Factory for years.  First in Washington DC and last in Natick.  The size of the menu is overwhelming.  I don't need to read a novel to decide what to eat.  On the plus side, there is something for everyone.  On the downside, with a menu that large it's inevitable quality will suffer. I hate the decor.  It's outdated and borders on tacky.  It's also very crowded and loud.  And they don't take reservations which annoys me.  If you're trying to plan a birthday dinner or other special get together, the no reservations policy crosses them right off my list.  Nobody wants guests to show up and have to wait 30 to 45 minutes for a table.   The food is well prepared, but they sometimes miss the mark on temperature.  Very inconsistent in that department.  Their cocktails are generous and really good.  Bottom line is that the food portions are good, but the quality vs. price needs to be balanced better. As for their cheesecake, that is also hit or miss.  It's pretty good, but I swear the whipped cream on mine had the taste of spray whipped cream.  I expect real whipped cream for the price and their signature.  Boooo."
Anne H.,"Manchester, NH",5,52,33,2.0,3/19/2014,"This particular location is always packed. There is nowhere to hang up your coat (I asked). Having to cram your winter jacket into the already tiny booth is not pleasant. Or maybe they'll sit you on that SUPER AKWARD row of tables where you're a mere inches away from the strangers dining on either side of you. It is so uncomfortable. It's almost exactly like a community dining experience, except here you have to consciously try not to hit your neighbor with your elbow when you're cutting your steak and also pretend not to notice the people on the other side of you talking about contraceptive methods or something else equally unappetizing. There is no privacy at these tables. To be fair, the community table thing is a feature at all Cheesecake Factory locations, not just this one.  On my last few visits to this location, the food has been overwhelmingly mediocre. This isn't just a complaint from me, it's from my friends as well. A few bites into our respective meals last night were all followed by ""this isn't as good as last time"". The Cheesecake Factory isn't what I would consider cheap, so i'd suggest saving your money to dine elsewhere.  Silver lining- the cheesecake is always delicious. Grab a slice to go. Also, the lemonade is amazing. I LOVE the sugar on the rim of the glass.  The lemonade is pricy & if you get a refill, they don't apply more sugar if you've already licked it off. Bummer, I know."
