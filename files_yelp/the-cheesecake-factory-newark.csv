Taylor B.,"Greenwich Township, NJ",3,2,,5.0,12/28/2017,"It was my first visit to a Cheesecake Factory. The wait time for my nephew and I was about 15 minutes, which really isn't bad at all. It was very busy in there, so I honestly thought it would've been longer. Our waitress was nice, but often times disappeared for times, but again, it was really busy, so that was fine. I was told by a family friend that the portions weren't huge, but when my plate came out, it was HUGE. I had no idea how I'd finish it, haha. The food was SO good. I got the Parmesan crusted chicken with mashed potatoes and green beans. My nephew got an omelette that came with toast and home fries. Again, huuuuge plate for him too. Of course, you can't go to the Cheesecake Factory and not have cheesecake. We took ours to go. I'm now just eating mine (Godiva chocolate cheesecake) and am in love. If you're a chocolate lover, I highly recommend it.  The only ""downfall"" were the prices, but I definitely didn't think it would be on the cheaper side. For my nephew and I, our meal totaled about $60 + tip: for 2 entrees, two Shirley temples, two slices of cheesecake, and Mac and cheese (had to try it, heard it was a must)  I would definitely come here again!"
Kayleigh P.,"Malvern, PA",41,126,224,3.0,8/18/2017,"Met up w/family from out of town here for dinner. Food is always good... only complaints are:   A - the menu is almost too diverse. Pages and pages long... I can barely decide with a normal menu B - floor is always super slippery in the Christiana Mall CF. Not sure how the poor wait staff and especially patrons in heels do not fall and kill themselves. They should have definitely gone with a non-slip surface instead of the really polished tile. (Although I would never condone this myself, if anyone is looking for a good slip-n-fall place for a fast bunch of lawsuit bucks, this would def be a good option!) Our appetizers included the mac-n-cheese balls (yummy comfort food in true form) and fried calamari (most tender calamari I've ever had is always at CF.) Followed by a variety of dinners, which were all very good. And wrapped up with several different kinds of cheesecakes. (My favorite is always the banana creme... so light, fluffy and refreshing after a full meal), but you can almost never go wrong with any of their flavors. Our waitstaff was friendly and efficient, and gave us several little gift cards at the end that are good for a free cheesecake with every $30 purchase (customer appreciation) good through 10/3."
Hannah M.,"Wilmington, DE",0,54,40,5.0,8/1/2017,"One of my favorite restaurants in Delaware and the only Cheesecake Factory restaurant location that is consistent (compared to all the other locations I've been to). I've never been disappointed at this Cheesecake Factory...the food is always good and we usually get outstanding service. I usually get Sheila's chicken and avocado salad or the farfalle with chicken pasta dish or sometimes even the bistro shrimp pasta...all really yummy! I even recommend the miso salmon, but ask them to cook it lightly...just so that the fish is flaky when you get it and not hard as a rock. Trust me, this request is do-able...my parents do this all the time and don't have any issues. And as for dessert, I like a lot of their cheesecakes and their cakes...you just have to go with what you're craving. Some of my faves include: tiramisu cheesecake, mango key lime cheesecake, red velvet cheesecake, key lime cheesecake, lemon meringue cheesecake, carrot cake...the list goes on and on.  Overall, love this place and will eat here for as long as I'm in Delaware."
Rick C.,"Belcamp, MD",51,53,127,4.0,11/13/2017,Big assisted Karen birthday today so we are eating at CF. So everything is delicious so far and very happy with the first app. Sweet corn cake tomales!!! Home run yessss maam!
Jennifer J.,"Kingfield, ME",37,76,80,5.0,6/14/2017,"I don't give 5 very often, but for my first ever visit to Cheesecake Factory I was impressed. They work to appeal to everyone and they are successful. I found something on every menu appealing.  I started with a dirty martini-per usual-and it was right-sized because I LoAThhh a tiny martini this day and age.  {Aside [restaurants with tiny martini and wine glasses, if you are reading this, SMARTEN UP! I will choose another restaurant for that reason alone if I'm in the mood for a drink] End aside} Then I moved on to crab bites while I read the massive menu! I can't tell you about it all, but there is literally something for everyone-clean, vegetarian, pescatarian, Mediterranean, omnivore, paleo it's all there!  For the entree I elected one of their new specials. I've always been a chicken parm lover and their chicken parm pizza is like an upside down chix parm! BIG round traditional chicken parm (when it arrived I thought oh crap! It's literally a pizza, but it's not) topped with a angel hair pasta with a lemon herb cream sauce. Very tasty. What really got me was the size. I'm on leftovers. So 2 dinners later and I still have lunch tomorrow. And I'm an eater! And then cheesecake of course. I had the raspberry with lemon cheesecake -wow! Next time the tiramisu cheesecake. I will be back. And I'm NOT a chain lover. No wonder it's such a large chain. They really do it right."
Deanna J.,"Newark, DE",32,5,,3.0,11/28/2017,"Everyone knows the Cheesecake Factory has great food and a good variety. That being said- they just got rid of the best food on the menu- the Crab Wontons!!! I am so disappointed as this was my favorite dish, as well as my friends and families. We will definitely miss it!    Also, compared to other Cheesecake factories I have been to (King of Prussia, Cherry Hill, Baltimore) this one unfortunately lacks more in good service/ food quality.  It also tends to have a long wait, I'd def recommend a reservation in advance!"
Saurabh N.,"Plano, TX",0,15,9,4.0,9/19/2017,"I had Evelyn's special pasta and it was ok, dry in taste but the ambiance of the place is amazing ! Service is awesome. This place has some amazing vibe. If you are looking for a noisy yet quite place to hang out with some good food, this is the one of the best places to go."
Lisa M.,"Garnet Valley, PA",84,426,164,4.0,10/3/2017,"You want to go out to eat but don't know what you want? Go to the Cheesecake Factory!! They have everything!   Seriously....my dad and I were at the mall for the Apple Store and we both wanted different things and this is the perfect place to eat.  We got a nice table outside on the patio, which either has a view of the mall entrance or parking lot but honestly you can do some nice people watching.   My dad got an eggplant dish which was delicious.  I got the southern fried catfish which left something to be desired but the sides of mashed potatoes were amazing.  We also split spinach dip, which was really tasty.  I took home a piece of the salted caramel cheesecake which I ate over the next two days.   You really can't go wrong here."
Ling C.,"Philadelphia, PA",14,90,171,4.0,9/29/2017,Had a peach Bellini and it was mixed perfectly. Corn tamale cakes are to die for. Plenty of leftovers. Not sure what they put in their food that makes me full every time but that's pretty consistent throughout all cheesecake factories. The menu is extensive and noticeable with how many choices u have. Came in for Sunday brunch but decided to get some other non brunch items. The calamari could've been better. Did not like the chicken in my chicken quiles( the nacho egg lookin thing ) which is part of the brunch menu. It was really hard to chew on as if it was stuck on the bottom of the pan and someone forgot to stir or mix it while cooking. You can tell if u look at the pictures that it looks hard.
Antoinette L.,"Brooklyn, NY",24,92,173,4.0,12/13/2016,"I come here all the time and they never disappoint. This time around I came with my family after the mall closed. During peak hours this place can have a hefty wait. On this particular occasion our waiter wasn't that engaging. Still, he got the job done. The service varies depending on who you get but I've never had anyone who was flat out rude. Management always accommodates if you have an issue. The menu is extensive so there is always something new to try. The desserts are great and the cheesecake is rich. I like the original cheesecake with a ""Big Ol"" strawberry on top! As well as the apple crumble.  Love, love, love. It looks fancier but is still affordable and the portions are more than enough."
Renee D.,"Philadelphia, PA",56,145,555,4.0,9/25/2016,"Another one of my fav chains, Cheesecake Factory at the Christiana Mall is always a hit with me and my dining companions. The space itself is a sprawling oasis and I like the variety of seating options. I don't know how to explain it except to say there are a lot of cozy nooks and crannies in there. Great for dates. There are however some spots I don't care to be seated at. Specifically the back wall booths directly behind the servers station. First of all its noisy and the traffic is insane from all the back and forth. What also draws me to the Factory are the diverse menu options.  There's something for everyone. The brunch menu is pretty good. The huevos ranchers are a little different from what I'm used to but was tasty nonetheless. The waffles are fluffy and while they don't have a traditional chicken and waffles dish my creative friend simply ordered chicken tenders to go with. The mini crab balls delicious. Not as dense as a crab cake but lighter almost like a fritter if you will. And last for me the pasta with the crispy Parmesan crusted chicken on top is always soul satisfying."
T T.,"Wallingford, Wallingford, PA",0,5,,4.0,12/21/2017,"The food is good very good. Steak tacos were excellent! Finished off dinner with Key Lime Pie Cheesecake, also excellent."
Brandon S.,"Crum Lynne, PA",66,3,1,3.0,3/4/2017,"I've been waiting for a long time to come down here to dine and I must say, it wasn't exactly what I thought it'd be.  First, the wait to be seated was estimated to be 50 minutes, but it actually was more like 20! That was awesome. Our waiter was not bad. He made sure to check up on us and was readily available. Also, he would repeat our every order he in exact detail back to us for approval. Perfect.  I ordered the Jamaican Black Pepper Chicken and Shrimp entree with a glass of red wine. The rice that came with the meal was unfortunately overcompensate and a little crunchy. The sauce on the chicken and shrimp was spicy and extremely flavorful however! Finally, you cannot go to the Cheesecake Factory and not get some Cheesecake. I ordered the key lime cheesecake a la mode.  This was literally heaven on a plate. It was so delicious that I had to slow down eating it to truly enjoy the perfect proportion of whipped cream, ice cream and the cheesecake on my spoon. Absolutely superb and I recommend that to finish off your meal.  All in all, I rated it a 3 because my meal was fairly lackluster given the entrée. My overall experience was so-so, but I would still recommend it, ESPECIALLY the Cheesecake !"
Kriti G.,"Newark, DE",11,42,15,3.0,7/26/2017,"Have been to cheesecake factory in 2 other states. This one was a little dull compared to them when it comes to entrees. But, cheesecakes are great. I usually like to grab a piece of cake to go."
Oliver J.,"Philadelphia, PA",508,48,107,4.0,3/2/2017,Food was just OK but bartender Zach was excellent!!!  He is great with his customers and has great conversation....
Krista P.,"Summerville, SC",74,14,13,5.0,5/28/2017,"The lemon raspberry cake and lemon cheese cakes where the surprise of the visit! I usually don't like them but we ordered a few options to share, and they were amazing! The chocolate did not disappoint! The food was delicious as well!"
Jeff Z.,"Bear, DE",3,43,5,3.0,11/10/2016,"My wife and I have been to this Cheesecake Factory several times and maybe one or two others out of state. The Cheesecake Factory's menus are huge. 20 pages or something outrageous like that, but in a good way. They have so many options to choose from that you will always find something to eat. Some of their fried foods like the fried shrimp and fish & chips are rather greasy when served. It would be nice of the chain could find a way to overcome that. The booths are a nice size and comfortable, but the tables are small an too close together. You can always easily listen on the conversation next to you. Not fond of that. The ceilings are high and the voices of everyone talking reverberate everywhere, making the noise level loud. I've never had a bad experience with the restaurant or their staff. I'm sure I'll be back to the Cheesecake Factory in the future."
Gina P.,"Elkton, MD",18,1,1,5.0,3/3/2017,Never tried this place Be for but I'm so glad I did....they are very nice and the food is amazing and music is great.....you have to come here
Teresa R.,"Wilmington, DE",54,19,36,4.0,6/23/2016,Oh this is one of our favorite places in a great location at Christiana Mall. Good is always good..
Jennifer L.,"Scottsdale, AZ",60,202,195,4.0,10/23/2016,"I have been to several cheesecake factory's. The wait was a typical 30 min I expected. The server needs to learn to pay more attention to her tables. My water was empty on several occasions and when it came time to pay, we had to catch her as she walked by to give it to her. The food however was delicious and came out the fastest I've ever had. Lastly the cheese cake is still yummy and worth each bite."
Jasmine W.,"Bear, DE",6,11,48,4.0,1/17/2016,"Came here with my family last night. Couldn't post this because they have really bad service depending on which area you're seated in. One suggestion would be that they offer their guest wifi.  I don't really like ""chain restaurants"" but this is one that is always great! The food menu is so extensive it offers so much to appease all appetites. The drinks (alcoholic) are also plentiful. I had the classic strawberry Margarita. It was okay. Not strong at all. Very light.  As my entrée I had the Baja Chicken Tacos, which never disappoint. It does say spicy chicken. To a person that enjoys spicy food, it's not that spicy to me. But if you prefer things that isn't spicy, choose another menu item.  All in all the experience was great. Look forward to the next dining experience."
L U.,"Townsend, DE",0,8,,3.0,5/14/2017,The estimated wait to be seated was 20-25 min and ended up being more like 50. Other than that the food and service were excellent. The space in the front of the restaurant could be used to better advantage since it is always so crowded. There is very limited seating and there are always crowds of people blocking the entrance during peak times. A redesign with more seats for people waiting might help it not feel so u comfortable and chaotic.
Mahalie R.,"Greenville, SC",19,25,46,4.0,8/13/2016,"Bang bang chicken and shrimp is the bomb. You can't go wrong with dessert every cheesecake I've ever had was delicious. I would say the drink menu is lacking, I wasn't impressed."
Marilyn C.,"Newark, DE",0,3,,2.0,8/29/2017,"I ordered the New York steak which comes w mashed potatoes and green beans. I ordered the steak medium but it was definitely way over cooked and dry. The potatoes were good but the green beans were not flavorful. I ordered 2 drinks the first being a peach flavored cocktail. It was good but probably had zero alcohol in it. My next choice was an Irish coffee which tasted like pure whiskey. So with the exception of the mashed potatoes, they got everything wrong. Maybe I shouldn't expect a steak to be cooked correctly unless I go to a steakhouse? Considering that I got food poisoning from there on a prior occasion and now this disappointing experience, I definitely won't be back."
Justin H.,"Bedford Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, NY",68,91,224,5.0,1/16/2016,"Came here tonight for my brother birthday dinner and they never disappoint. Good food, great service and amazing cheesecake . To drink I had the ""modern old fashioned"" which was quite tasty, well crafted with a decent strength. I ordered the Jamaican pepper shrimp entree with white rice, black beans and plantains- amazing! It is a little on the spicy side though so if you don't enjoy your mouth a little tingly you might want to try something else.  The waitress was very attentive and timely which helped us have a smooth evening."
Mitchell L.,"San Antonio, TX",55,7,,1.0,2/18/2017,Probably the worst run cheesecake location nationally.  The wait was quoted at 40 minutes and turned out to be 70 minutes.   The manager talked himself into circles when asked about the actual vs quoted wait time.  Service is very slow.  Even before we got our meal the server forgot sever two requests.   The food is OK but this location is the dregs of their portfolio.
Jessie H.,"Manhattan, NY",276,928,650,5.0,1/16/2015,"I've been several cheesecake factories in different cities and this one is of my favorite!! I got the chicken carbonara with parmesan cheese. ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS! I mean I was super hungry but it was amazing. It was a huge portion so I had to pack up half and bring it home with me for lunch the next day. I also got a fresh strawberry cheesecake..AMAZING!! My friend got the smores cheesecake...OMG TO DIE FOR. SO GOOD!!!! I recommend either but if you love chocolate, get the Smores! Service is great! There might be a line on weekdays so you can either sit at the bar or wait."
Taha M.,"Seminary Hill, Alexandria, VA",25,1,,5.0,9/14/2017,Great service here !! Kristyn was our server thank you for here . And the ambiance here is very good too . If you come to christiana mall come here ....!!
Kayla S.,"Newark, DE",35,13,1,4.0,4/18/2017,"It's no secret that the Cheesecake Factor has done the near impossible, mastered pretty much everything they make. I've never had a bad meal here, I won't say everything is always perfect, but I've had no complaints. This one stays pretty busy and getting parking is near impossible (it's at a mall!) but the food is good. And there are so many options everyone can find something."
Guang L.,"Plainsboro Township, NJ",105,6,2,2.0,2/11/2017,Three pieces of chicken nuggets. A splash of garlic and olive oil with a handful of sun dried tomatoes and veggies. Thats the 18 dollar version of  Cheesecake Factories Garlic noodles. As much as i hate to have to write this review because your avocado egg rolls and cheesecakes are out of this world. This meal was highly disappointing.
Crystal E.,"Philadelphia, PA",248,104,338,1.0,9/19/2015,"I usually love this place. Yes, the wait can turn you off, but it is one of the smaller cheesecake factories within the company. Last Saturday we had a business luncheon, and there were 7 of us. We all love this location because of the service. Well, that changed drastically! The original waitress, Judith, was so rude and disconnected that after 20 minutes of waiting for her to take our drink menus, I had to alert the store manager!  The manager immediately apologized and replaced her with a new waitress, Pam! PAM IS A POWERHOUSE! When you visit, ask for PAM! Although she is younger, her attention to detail and knowledge of everything is beyond her years! She started from the drinks and keep it moving! We had a ball, and she was extremely generous. I hope she trains others!"
Rachel B.,"West Grove, PA",1,32,1,2.0,12/1/2015,"We were excited to dine for lunch at the Cheesecake, we loved the one in Chestnut hill, ma.  Today was not good, slow service, and two issues with kids meals.  The spaghetti with meatball was not great, they were out of meatballs so they offered to mAke a meat sauce- bad idea. The meat was undercooked and sitting on the pasta, our son would not eat it.  Our daughter found in her food a sprig of ??? We pointed it out to the server and she dismissed it- we will not be back.  Too bad, they were ounce good-but they have lost their edge."
Loretta W.,"Dover, DE",32,23,95,5.0,7/22/2017,"I've eaten here several times and have always had good experiences and today was even better because our server Lauren was phenomenal! She was friendly personal and even humorous with me and my husband. We asked her what her favorite dish was and she was glad to share the information while being very enthusiastic about it. She knew the menu very well also (which is extensive). She continued to refill my husbands drinks without even asking! I ordered the chicken bellagio and my husband ordered the Louisiana chicken pasta. Our chicken was cooked to perfection and we both enjoyed the flavor of them very much. The menu has numerous chicken, pasta, drink and appetizer items. Menu here also has the ""healthier "" choices if you desire too. The chocolate hazelnut cheesecake is my favorite so of course I ordered that for desert! Yum yum! We ordered fried mac n cheese for appetizer and we loved that as well. The atmosphere is a little loud but this restaurant is extremely busy so that is expected. Only disappointment was the wait, but again, this place is very very busy every time I come here so.... it is what it is."
Robin W.,"Bear, DE",0,4,,5.0,2/26/2017,"Went for an early dinner because we did not want to wait. The food is always great, service was good and then there is the cheesecake. They have other sweet stuff if you do not like cheesecake."
Nataya J.,"Newark, DE",1,9,30,4.0,5/21/2016,"Definitely a regular here. The food is always good and flavors are consistent. My only complaint would be the wait... You have to wait long to be seated, and long for your food. Honestly, when you go to a good restaurant, this is expected. If possible, make reservations if you don't want to wait. I think they only do reservations during weekdays. Call ahead to be sure. Also, good parking is hard to get! The beginning of the parking lot is always filled. You can park over by target or anywhere you see a spot if you don't mind the walk. This location is at the mall, so it's always busy."
Liming C.,"Wilmington, DE",23,8,,5.0,11/7/2016,"Here last week, sit down really quick. Enjoy the atmosphere, and order the food. The food here taste better than the Cheese Cake Factory in Abington and many places. The food is satisfying. The taste is perfect for me that day! Hopefully, people shop around Christiana Mall can stop by and try this place!!"
Sherry J.,"Newark, DE",54,487,1111,5.0,2/2/2015,"Visited with Steph and Alex on a Sunday night.  I ordered the Georgia Peach which is  my favorite drink ,and we skipped appetizers so we could make it to dessert. I had the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp which is a spicy thai dish with curry, peanut, chile and coconut, with sautéed Vegetables and served over steamed white rice. It was so good and covered in toasted coconut, with large pieces of shrimp and chicken.  I could not eat it all, because I had to get the Mango Key Lime Cheesecake. They all sound good but this one is my absolute favorite!! It is like being in cheesecake heaven."
Chrissy S.,"Rehoboth Beach, DE",25,4,2,5.0,11/11/2016,Always a great time at The Cheesecake Factory.  Not long to wait and the service and food is delicious!  Chicken Picatta is the best!
Na T.,"Philadelphia, PA",5,49,,4.0,1/2/2016,"There are some people who get on their high, hipster horses about chain restaurants -- blah blah blah something about authenticity blah blah blah...Who cares if the food tastes good? And, generally speaking, the food at the Cheesecake Factory, while likely considered predictable and uninspired by the clichéd foodies of the world, does indeed taste pretty good.  The wait times, however, can be a legitimate buzzkill as CF doesn't offer call ahead or reserved seating.  The waiting area is essentially nonexistent and has horrible flow.  Also, the Christiana Mall location does get pretty slammed, which is a common feature  among most other CF locations. If you get there before 4 pm on a high volume day, the wait time should be pretty bearable. The food quality is not too shabby; the overwhelming menu offers something for just about everybody except for Anthony Bourdain wannabes, and who wants to break bread with blowhards like that anyway? I enjoy the grilled steak tacos, guacamole, and dynamite shrimp. My boyfriend tears up the dynamite shrimp and is somewhat fond of the bang bang chicken and shrimp. For dessert, the chocolate tower truffle cake is a necessity. Seriously, the fate of collective human happiness rests upon this slab of chocolatey goodness. Whenever we visit, we receive pretty decent service. Hopefully that won't change any time soon. If you're looking for a relaxed, casual atmosphere that is small on snobbery and big on selection, then you ought to try this place out!"
Brianna W.,"Newark, DE",23,14,3,4.0,5/6/2017,"I've been to this location a few times, the food is good, however some options aren't so great, definitely ask for a recommendation from the servers, they are very knowledgeable and give good suggestions, the cheesecake is amazing a good spot for lunch too and not as expensive, the only downfall is they are very busy most of the time hopefully they will expand this location"
