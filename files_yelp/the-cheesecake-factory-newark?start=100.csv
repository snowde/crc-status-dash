Torey C.,"Wilmington, DE",39,63,64,3.0,4/8/2013,This place is over-priced. I say this based the price of a cosmopolitan made with Skyy vodka $11.50 REALLY!!  I enjoyed my salad and the service was great. I was taken back with the price of the drink. I will go again and just order water next time.
Stephanie H.,"Elkton, MD",5,50,69,2.0,11/18/2012,"For the money, the food from this place is really not all that. Great presentation, but the cheesecake is actually in my opinion not good at all. I have tried vanilla, key lime, the peanut butter cup one, and regular. Couldn't eat it. The newest Moroccan dish is sub par, claims to be marinated and just tastes blah. I'd rather get something from inside the food court and save my money for shopping."
Tracey H.,"Landenberg, PA",14,32,46,4.0,9/2/2013,"Today was our 3rd time at the Cheesecake Factory. Everything I've ever had is better than good. The menu is extensive ... Mexican, Italian, Asian, American, omelets, small plates, skinny meals. Tonight I had the fried fish sandwich on toasted brioche. It was really really good. The weather was lovely so we sat outside. Our waitress was excellent. Can't wait to go back and try something else."
Chad M.,"North East, MD",10,30,9,2.0,8/5/2010,"The service was good, the atmosphere was good but the food, although pretty to look at, was bland. I ordered the Orange Chicken, my wife the Chicken Marsala. Neither were served with any real flavor, so much so that I wondered if it was the intent to make bland entrees so that the Cheesecake would stand out in the end? Regrettably, however even the Cheesecake was not that impressive. My Cheesecake was average at best. In the end I felt the entire experiance was disappointing and I regret waiting 15 minutes to be seated at 2pm in the afternoon on a Sunday. I have no idea why people would stand 45 minutes or longer for a dinner service."
Wayne R.,"Newark, DE",0,12,1,4.0,5/31/2010,"My family and I visited the new Factory at the Christiana Mall this weekend for my daughter's birthday.  Had a good time.  The Memphis Burger was big - pulled pork and coleslaw on top of a regular burger - and quite tasty.  The Dutch Apple Caramel cheesecake for dessert was really good as well. I actually thought the service was better than average, as no less than four different servers came by and waited on us throughout the meal.  It seemed to be a point of emphasis that none of the staff walking by allow a beverage to get too low.  Meanwhile, our waiter was also prompt and friendly. It felt like the bill was a little on the pricey side after figuring out what we ate, but that's the deal with this place I guess.  It's an upscale chain restaurant and you should definitely appreciate that going in.  It was packed though, and routinely has long lines. I think we'll definitely go back for other 'celebratory'-type meals.  Just feels like that sort of place.  Enjoyed it!"
Christina K.,"Sicklerville, NJ",14,10,1,2.0,2/9/2013,"Surprisingly, the service was very bad. Not at all what I'm used to at other Cheesecake Factory restaurants, the waiter did not even give us straws with our drinks, we had to ask our food runner for straws because our waiter was nowhere to be found."
Vivienne H.,"Chicago, IL",25,24,218,4.0,1/9/2013,Friendly service and awesome cake! We ordered special chicken and burger. The onion ring is quite delicious. Cake is best!
T. C.,"Pemberton, NJ",0,3,1,4.0,6/29/2011,"The food is excellent--we had the fire roasted artichoke appetizer to start.  It was cooked to perfection and paired with a very tasty dipping sauces that supplemented the artichoke. The main entrees were also superb.  We chose the Luau Salad and Bar-b-que Salmon. Both were well prepared and presented.  The salad had a great combination of fresh ingredients and the serving size is very generous. The BBQ salmon was exquisite.  It's so easy to cook seafood improperly--to cook it too long or not long enough, use the wrong seasonings or make poor choices for sides.  Everything was right in this case: The salmon was perfectly cooked. The BBQ sauce was tangy and flavorful but not overpowering,  so it didn't eclipse the delicate taste of the fish. What cannot be understated is the quality of the service. The staff were friendly, professional and attentive.  What was really special was the personal attention from the manager.  When notified that the young child with us was cold, he raised the thermostat and returned promptly with a Cheesecake Factory T-shirt and stuffed penguin toy.  She couldn't have been more pleased.   All things considered, it was a superb dining experience and we will certainly return again soon."
T K.,"Newark, DE",0,73,1,3.0,2/12/2014,"Food was OK for lunch.  Soup was tasty but not hot. Salad was plentiful but oily. Sandwich roll was fresh. Tea was weak. We didn't see our waitress at all, could have used another beverage. I have had better cheesecake, not worth the calories or the price. Next time we will try one of the other mall eateries."
Eric M.,"SHAVERTOWN, PA",0,11,,4.0,6/25/2012,"I don't have a cheesecake factory near me, so any time I have an excuse to go to one I take it. This place is fantastic. Good food, great dessert,  good prices-what else could you want?"
Joe T.,"Meridian, MS",2,39,,4.0,8/27/2013,"In the mood for a good salad, I ordered crab and artey chokes as an appetizer.  Not dissapointed, it was scrumptous.  Got the salad I ordered....lettuce with some fruit mixed in.  Much lettuce, not much fruit.  Still pretty good though.  Would have been awesome with more fruit, pecans, feta, etc. Next time, I'll get the BBQ chicken salad.  I was sorely tempted to eat some of my buddies when he wasn't looking.  My tummy was excited to start, just satisfied to end."
T R.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,6,2,5.0,7/26/2012,Went with a girlfriend after shopping.  Wow the decor was way past my expectations...after all it's in a mall.   Should be in Vegas or at least AC.   The menu was huge and our waiter helped us decide.   He had great food pics.    Food was so good.   Will definitely go back!
David W.,"Middletown, DE",1,39,,2.0,5/16/2011,"Very poor, especially when compared to other outlets in the same chain. The Christiana restaurant is much smaller than the average Cheesecake Factory and as a result it is unbearably crowded and the wait times (which one understands will be long going in) are exasperated. Staff is not up to par with other locations. Part of the Cheesecake Factory experience is top notch waitstaff, but not here. We were also disappointed by the food. Not to the level of quality one expects from CF but at the same price."
Igor O.,"Bear, DE",4,67,103,3.0,12/25/2011,Not bad. Had Jamaican shrimp. Wasabi crusted tuna wasn't great. Good coffee. Lots of flies.
Emma G.,"Newark, DE",0,7,,4.0,11/19/2011,I would have given a five star rating except for the extreme wait times. The food is amazing and the staff is awesome too. One of my favorites.
Melissa C.,"Wilmington, DE",40,7,8,4.0,5/5/2010,"Two girlfriends and I visited the new location at Christiana Mall this past weekend, and we were very happy with our visit. It was a gorgeous day and we were able to sit outside without too much of a wait. Our server was friendly and efficient, and our food was wonderful. All three of us ordered pretty light fare, in anticipation of concentrating of dessert. We shared Arugula Salad, Beets with Goat Cheese, Greek Salad, Crispy Artichoke Hearts, Ahi Tartar and Shrimp Scampi Crostini. Everything was beautifully fresh and tasty. The menu is as think as a book, so in the future I will try to decide what I'd like to have before going. The cheesecake was AMAZING. Key Lime, Adam's Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple, and some other amazing chocolate monster served with ice cream (I cannot find the name) were ordered, consumed and greatly enjoyed. The only things that keeps The Cheesecake Factory from receiving the 5th star from me is that you definitely felt like you were in a chain restaurant and the three of us together spent over a hundred dollars and we didn't even have alcoholic drinks, making it an expensive afternoon nosh."
Rebecca Z.,"Newark, DE",50,9,1,4.0,4/30/2013,"So the food is pretty good here, service is always great.  I absolutely love their carpaccio.  That's usually why we end up going here.  I have had a few other entrees here, and all of them are at least good.  They have a few things that are exceptional.  Then there is the cheesecake.  Who can go wrong with cheesecake?  Overall a great place to go even at a mall location we have never had to wait for more than 15 minutes, and they do call aheads which is great when you have 4 kids and it takes forever to get out the door!"
Robert W.,"Newark, DE",0,16,,4.0,7/5/2012,"Obviously a chain so not quite the unique feel of a great local place but all things considered they have very good food (upper end pricing for a chain like this but that's expected), a friendly staff, and a ridiculously lengthy menu...and delicious desserts! Most recently had the Bang Bang chicken and shrimp and it was very good. Hard to give any chain 5 stars but outside of the steakhouses...hard to find a better and more consistent chain restaurant with a diverse menu."
andrea w.,"Wilmington, DE",1,16,2,3.0,10/3/2011,Finally a place to go in the mall that you can get waited on except TGI Fridays...This place is typical chain ...Some items are extremely reasonable and delicious like the small pizzas and the corn fritters. I love the chicken Thai lettuce wraps because the sauces are delicious! Don't EVER get the fried mac and cheese (my 15 year old ordered this dish) It is horrible AND expensive didn't even touch 4 of the 5 huge fried balls. The waiter never asked if we were happy with the dish...It is pretty obvious when you are paying $10 for an app and you don't touch it ! Be careful of the drinks too..$3 for a soda! Overall good food and good service...
