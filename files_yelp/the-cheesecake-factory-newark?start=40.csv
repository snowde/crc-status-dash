Michele N.,"Bear, DE",0,11,2,5.0,10/25/2016,I just love it here! The food is gourmet the presentation always wows me..... I had a kale salad with salmon  OMG was it delicious  The salmon was perfectly cooked moist  And seasoned to perfection  The salad was beyond yummy with the perfect amount of dressing Always a great experience  I have never  Had a bad meal or experience here.
Sabrina D.,"Camden Wyoming, DE",0,6,5,2.0,3/19/2017,"Food is great, wait and waiting area is not! They need a better layout for the amount of traffic they have constantly. We had a hr 45 min wait. We decided to walk the mall for the first hr 30. The waiting area is ridiculous and the staff gets very rude, telling people to move and yelling. Where do expect people to wait outside in 30 below weather, and when the pager doesn't work beyond 20 ft. I'll probably skip this place next time not worth the wait especially when folks are getting yelled at by staff."
Lisa J.,"Seaford, DE",0,1,,1.0,3/26/2017,I give this particular Cheesecake Factory one star because the wait was much longer than the hostess said. The steak was unseasoned so I ordered the fried fish and it was an unfortunate failure also. The one positive aspect of this visit was the professionalism from the wait staff..Will not be returning
Helen A.,"Smyrna, DE",0,26,,4.0,9/8/2016,"I met a friend for lunch and we were seated promptly.  We ordered the crab artichoke dip for starters and and each a ordered salads.  I had the lunch size chicken Caesar salad and my fried had the Asian salad, both on the ""skinneylicious"" menu.  Both salads were quite good as was the crab dip, but it was a bit salty and didn't have an abundance of crab meat.  Unfortunately, we were too full to have desert!  Definitely   Would come back.  Also rest rooms are very clean."
Robert L.,"Newark, DE",2,34,3,2.0,7/7/2016,Ordered carry out. Honestly expected better quality for it being a Wednesday night. The fries were cold and hard like cardboard. The veggie burger was just a rice patty. No mushrooms or other veggies that they advertise on menu. I will not be back. The prices are too high for the quality of food.
Elaina G.,"Egg Harbor City, NJ",5,41,16,5.0,11/27/2015,"This restaurant is the BOMB! I went here with my parents and my brother about 5 weeks ago and it was delicious. This being my second time, I knew what to expect. I got the Pasta Carbonara and for dessert, the Lemon Raspberry Creme Cheesecake. Iverall, a nice place to take the kids, the portions are huge, so come with an appetite!"
Meg G.,"Glassboro, NJ",0,58,212,4.0,8/6/2016,"I've been here a few times and have had a good experience each time I have come. The food is really good. The menu is huge but I appreciate the variety. I also appreciate that Cheesecake Factory offers a ""skinnylicious"" menu for those being health conscious."
Donna B.,"Newark, DE",0,5,,1.0,1/7/2017,"Miserable young girls at front counter. Never made eye contact. Very short with answers. Background music in restaurant was so terrible. All of this put my party of 4 in a bad mood before even getting seated. Once seated, server just ok."
Philip C.,"Wilmington, DE",234,18,,4.0,5/10/2016,Good cheesecake but my guest got ill after having the shepherd pie.  So maybe we will not go back again.  I hate to blame the restaurant as I did not get ill.  But I can't be sure.
Sporadic W.,"Charlotte, NC",156,376,1140,3.0,2/20/2015,"Went for happy hour from 4-6pm yesterday. Appetizers and drinks on the happy hour menu are $5 and small plates range in price from $4-7. Our table ordered mojitos, cosmopolitans, skinny girl martinis, fried Mac & cheese balls, burgers, buffalo chicken blast, artichoke heart, bread & butter is complimentary, and I think there was something else for happy hour, but don't remember. Burgers were received well. Buffalo blast was mediocre, it's not chicken wings, apparently the chicken it shredded and mixed with batter or put inside a wonton wrap and then fried, so there isn't much chicken. Table favorite hands down was the macaroni and cheese balls with marinara sauce. Everyone at the table likes artichoke and we were all sorely disappointed when it came out; it looked old roasted and dry, and was equally bland and very chewy. We sent it back to the kitchen.  Drinks. Mojito had lots of mint and was delicious, so we ended up ordering a second. Skinny girl martini, didn't try it, but the person who ordered did not mention anything about it, but decided to order a second, so I'm assuming it was also good. Cosmo, the person who ordered this liked it, but it was a bit of a fiasco. The drink came with the customary salt around the edges which was not requested, it was sent back, they then poured it from the salted glass to another glass hence taking some of the salt with it, which was again returned and remade in a new glass. That item was also order a second time. Desserts, unfortunately are not a part of the happy hour menu at all. So the slices are pretty much $8/9 each, which is fairly ridiculous. I know most of them are specialties, but still a lot per slice. One friend ordered the lime/lemon meringue cheesecake, which was almost gone before we left. She loved it. I ordered Chris's outrageous cheesecake which was equally delicious and took half home with me, and our other friend had the strawberry cheese, which she said was good as well.  We all would definitely return for happy hour, the happy hour menu is both impressive and extensive, unlike other restaurants that just have 3-5 choices, is tasty, and service is friendly. Even though we returned items to the kitchen, there wasn't any backlash. Our server remained professional and courteous, even if she was thinking something else. Lol"
Ameen W.,"New Castle, DE",60,13,2,4.0,5/7/2016,I love the atmosphere as well as the dim lights. It's romantic and the food is great. I always get the Bang Bang chicken! I think its the best item on the menu.
Frederick B.,"Anaheim, CA",0,16,,3.0,11/2/2016,"Celebrated my daughters birthday here last evening. Waitress was great but drinks sucked. I do not mind oaying $12.00 for a vodka martini, but please put some vodka in it without the ice. Martini glass was small and only 2/3 full. Food was OK."
Alan S.,"Chester, PA",123,1,3,1.0,1/6/2016,Bad service racist service and super slow ... And extra the manager is 0%professional ...
Lauren W.,"Sydney, Australia",200,267,259,4.0,7/9/2013,"I confess - I'm a huge fan. Say what you will, I don't care.  Cheesecake Factory's, like many chains, are very similar in all of their locations. Christiana is no different, except perhaps a little bit smaller than others. I've been about three or four times now, and every server has been very good and very patient. I feel like the food at Cheesecake is so consistent. I really can't remember ever having anything bad at any location. I've always gone for lunch, and it has never been more than half full and so we are seated right away. There is also an ample amount of outside tables, but it's right next to the entrance to a busy food court in the mall.  Highly recommend this place, very solid option for lunch or dinner. Like I said, you can pick almost anything that sounds good for you, and it will be delicious. I tend to go for their pastas and sandwiches. Most recently I've had their cuban sandwich. It's their version on the traditional, but very tasty. Historically I haven't been a fan of sweet potato fries, but theirs were awesome! Perfectly crispily cooked. I'm also not big on dessert, but their red velvet cheesecake is the only thing that changes my mind. I think the only downside to this location is the parking. The lot is fairly shallow right by their entrance, and so you often have to park far away. Once you consider the portion sizes of their meals though, you'll want to park far away to walk it off!"
Rachael R.,"New Castle, DE",37,5,2,3.0,11/9/2015,"The food was really tasty. However, my boyfriend's pretzel coated chicken was dry and TOO crunchy. Our server had a very poor attitude. My boyfriend would say ""thank you"" and she would not acknowledge him. She tossed the check book onto the table and took FOREVER to give us refills and clear off our eating space. When we asked her if she was okay she just said ""na I'm good"" while turning her back. She did not apologize or anything. If it weren't for her this review would have been a four."
Teresa R.,"Wilmington, DE",17,23,47,4.0,10/6/2013,It was my husband's first time there. He Was very impressed with the atmosphere and the food. We Were able to eat outside on the patio.  Which Made a very nice evening.
Jana C.,"East Bay, CA",470,2986,10633,3.0,2/25/2013,"Ate at the bar to elude the ridiculous double-line queue of hungry patrons. Our wait: 3-4 minutes because we sharked out the bar area. Expected and reliable fare for the brunch hour. Pineapple mojito was quite tasty! Some rocket salad with shaved cheese, some pear, blue cheese flatbread, a chicken avocado grilled club, and we foiled our own plans: absolutely no room for any cheesecake. Kinda defeated the purpose for coming. Among 3-4 other CF that O have patronized, this one in DE is a bit smaller (Pdx, Sacto, SF). Ever popular and swarming...can access the restaurant from the exterior. 90 degrees away from the Brio/CPK/Lawson side."
Christopher C.,"Gaithersburg, MD",6,72,195,1.0,8/26/2014,"I have always enjoyed the food at the Cheesecake Factory - most recently the Greek salad has become a favorite with the Teriyaki Chicken and the Pepperoni Pizza. Of course I love the desserts!  This has been a great addition to Christiana Mall and has ample seating although it isn't the largest Cheesecake Factory.  The reason a 3.5 star establishment gets 1 star is the absurd corporate policy of sending out kids menu food on plates to hot to the touch. Why they cannot simply plate on regular plates is beyond me. Every time we are there with our kids, we have to send their orders back to be re-plated. As long as this continues to be corporate policy at the Cheesecake Factory, I will give everyone I eat at 1 star reviews despite the level of the service."
Luke D.,"Wilmington, DE",4,41,,4.0,10/11/2015,"If I reviewd restaurants on food only, this location would be 5 stars. However, i review the dining expirence.  First, the lighting is terrible. It was a busy night and they were on a wait, no complaints there. The lighting was so bad I could not read the menu without the help of a cell phone. Next, the service was terrific. The Cobb salad was awesome, whole avacado, chicken, bacon, veggies. The cheesecake was $8 a slice. I could buy an entire cheesecake for 8 bucks. And the restroom was dirty. Would go again."
Veena D.,"Newark, DE",4,12,1,2.0,10/23/2015,The menu does not have a variety and it's pretty simple. I chose the soft tacos and they were pretty good. Nothing else on the menu looked appetizing. The space of the tables are entirely too close for my liking.
