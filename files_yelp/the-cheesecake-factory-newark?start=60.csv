Hennifer K.,"Wernersville, PA",0,55,2,4.0,11/4/2015,"Went for dinner last night, only about a ten minute wait. Our waitress was very good brought out our sons food first and ours followed soon after. Very attentive, the food was ok, typical chain food. The cheese cake was insane! So good!!! The lighting is a little dark other than that no issues at all I would reccomend"
Monica R.,"Wilmington, DE",1,2,,1.0,1/4/2016,"The service was subpar, had too wait 20 minutes for anything we asked, ie... Water, refill drinks, steak knife.   WTH!!!!  Spent way too much money for ice cold mashed potatoes.  I expressed that I was not happy with the service or food and nothing was done about it.  I will never, ever, ever go back."
Charlene W.,"Newark, DE",0,10,1,2.0,2/26/2016,"This was the worst service I have experienced. We waited 40 minutes for a table for 5. While waiting I saw strollers wheel chairs and sleeping babies being held in a mothers arm. Standing room only. Once we got seated it was so dark you needed a flashlight to read the menu. 3 people ordered appetizers, there food came fast. So while they ate 2 people sat and watched, starving after waiting 40 minutes. Once the other food came, it was horrible. Burnt fish and under cooked vegetables   The complaints lead to the manager coming to our table. They tried redoing the vegetables but they were raw as fresh produce. She offered me an alternative but I refused. Corn was so under cooked I couldn't swallow it. I was offered a free cheese cake. I don't like cheesecake either. It was my granddaughters birthday. They did get that right, with the cake and candle singing happy birthday. I was so dissatisfied I may have ruined the moan"
Cindy S.,"Wilmington, DE",31,28,2,1.0,12/9/2015,"Good food, but lousy service. Every time I go in there the bathrooms are always dirty and there's never any toilet paper. You sit down your feet stick to the floor in the restaurant. It just makes you wonder where your food is coming from. Always crowded, loud and disorganized.  Such a shame because I've heard such great things about it... Gave it my three - strike you're out."
RT S.,"Chicago, IL",8,232,630,4.0,1/4/2013,"Prompt service We ordered shrimp scampi, shrimp linguine and turkey burger Everything was delicious and service was pleasant"
Cristina C.,"Newark, DE",50,65,13,1.0,1/15/2014,"Let me start with this: I am 30 years old.  I went into this restaurant yesterday to use the gift card I received for Christmas.  I ordered a glass of Chardonnay (because even if they switch it up and bring you the house, chances are it will be decent).  I handed my ID to the waitress and she looked at it and informed me that it had expired (a week before-- on my 30th birthday)......  The waitress proceeded to shrink down to the floor and tell me that she was unable to serve me because the ID was expired. She told me that she could get into a lot of trouble.  I am not sure what the link is between her getting into ""a lot of trouble"" and my ID being expired...? I am not underage, and I was not driving a car, so how exactly could she get into ""trouble"" ?????  I could see if I had no ID at all, but it clearly stated my DOB being WELL OVER the legal drinking age.  I got through Philly airport a few days before & that's where it was pointed out that the ID had expired, ON MY 30TH BIRTHDAY!!!!  I guess I can get through homeland security, but the Cheesecake factory had none of it!"
Karen C.,"Wilmington, DE",0,14,,2.0,3/11/2016,"Too dark, too noisy and too expensive. We all had to use our phones to see the menu, the food and our check. I ordered their ""famous"" meatloaf. It was just OK, but I can get better at a local diner for $8.99. I love succotash, but this was raw. The corn was like fresh off the cob and thrown in a pan with tomatoes and zucchini for about one minute. Won't be back."
Michael H.,"Leavenworth, WA",0,9,3,1.0,8/5/2015,I wish I could write a negative review although the app won't let me. Been at the restaurant for 2 hours. Ordered 1.5 hours ago and still don't have our meal.
Phil S.,"Newark, DE",2,5,,1.0,6/15/2015,Terrible food and terrible menu. Dessert is good though. Go to a local mom and pop restaurant instead.
Tierney W.,"Bear, DE",1,53,19,4.0,7/21/2015,"Always have a great meal here. We always come early or at odd times in order to miss the rush and long wait time, I'd suggest coming for lunch or an early dinner. The staff is always fairly friendly and attentive considering how many tables there are to take care of they are wonderful. I usually get a sandwich they have it's basically a blt with turkey and avocado (can't remember the name whoops). But everything is always great. All the items on the menu are priced really well for what you get. However, my family gets caught up in the extensive menu and often spurges on trying appetizers or getting a slice of cake to take home, and that tends to be what gets the bill looking less fun."
James R.,"Long Island City, NY",3,104,3,3.0,12/18/2014,"Well now, look what we got here: 25 kinds of cheesecake, as well as a burger bistro menu with the usual suspects (10 types of chicken, burritos, nachos, 15 pastas, steaks,  surf n turf, personal pizza). Portions are generous, service is well-drilled, and the decor screams upmarket airport lounge. Appears popular."
Thomas S.,"Philadelphia, PA",3,5,5,1.0,3/19/2015,"I was here with my family to enjoy a good dinner on a Saturday night.  I've never been to this location before and I most certainly won't be returning.  For starters, we had a crackhead waitress.  No, I'm serious, our waitress was a straight up crackhead, she probably was high while we were there.  She took our drink and food orders, and she never came back to our table.  She avoided us the whole time.  Some other waitress brung our food out, some other waitress gave us our drinks.  When we finally saw her long after we we finished eating, we asked for a refill. She said this direct quote ""I'll have the manager bring it to you"". Now I sense racism and she've been avoiding us because of the 'black people don't tip' stereotype.  We never got the drinks by the way.  After waiting for an additional half hour, we stopped her again while she was trying to avoid us and demanded the bill and some boxes.  We were finished for about an hour and never got any refills.  I hate this restaurant and won't ever come back!  I hope that crackhead waitress they have overdose in the bathroom on whatever it is she's shooting in her arm.  The table behind us was a black family too and they was having the same problem.  Sucks for her because I always tip at least 15%.  The food is good by the way.  If you don't want to be racially discriminated against, don't eat here.  They will judge you solely because of your race and won't do their job while you have to watch them take so much care of everyone else."
Michelle M.,"Wilmington, DE",9,85,17,2.0,2/13/2014,"We weren't sure what to expect from this place when we went there...knew it was a chain but how could a place that specializes in cheesecake possibly be bad? right? There are several reason why: 1.) they have a menu that is over 7 pages long! How can you do anything extremely well if you have that many damn items on the menu. From tartar to burgers? Seafood to tacos? Just to expansive for the cooks to get anything 100% spot on with cooking techniques and flavor/seasoning. 2.) they have a dish there that is the most caloric pasta dish overall out of all the nation's chain restaurants. Ummm...hello?!?! 3.) their cheesecake, while yummy, should have a warning that each slice is a MINIMUM of 1,100 calories. 4.) the service is subpar with many young kids that are more interested in flirting with one another and checking their smartphones than effectively waiting on tables. 5.) Salads are overdressed to the point of being slimey and mush. I just don't have the energy to go on. It is a chain restaurant that's main goal is to cash in on as many customers a night as possible. Even though they are no cheap, you are still getting subpar food with half ass service. Again, please take into account that this is my humble opinion."
Basma S.,"Westwood, Los Angeles, CA",8,21,35,5.0,2/17/2015,"I love trying new restaurants & new food, but Cheese Cake Factory still is my favorite. ""Jim"" is the best waiter I have ever seen in my life such a loyal and friendly with everyone.. Great service.. I hope the manager take a look on my review and give him a bonus (;"
Jan Marie D.,"Somerville, MA",60,67,43,1.0,11/14/2013,"Horrific experience. I'm allergic to cow's milk. My waitress brings me my veggie burger, whose bun was coated in BUTTER. So I ask our waitress, Lori, to check if the bun itself had whey or other milk products. She comes back and says that she has a gluten-free bun that doesn't contain wheat. Did I stutter? Milk and wheat are not even remotely the same thing.  So I told her to scrap the burger and I got a goat cheese beer salad. Still to be determined if the pecans in the salad were candied in butter. If I go into anaphylaxis in an hour I guess I'll know."
Angie W.,"Manhattan, NY",32,21,86,4.0,3/30/2014,Gave me a new found love of Asparagus! The burger was perfection and what seemed like garlic fries were all of that.
David C.,"Hockessin, DE",85,12,,3.0,12/2/2014,Food here is alright. It's not bad but it's not something I would ever crave either.  Slightly pricey food but I guess some people come here for the atmosphere. They got my food order wrong once but the manager came out and apologized so I don't really mind. People make mistakes and I guess at least this place has the decency to recognize and apologize for it.
Michael V.,"Magnolia, DE",49,30,3,5.0,12/31/2014,"When I go to Christiana mall, I usually make my way over to The Cheesecake Factory for lunch.  They have a huge selection of food there, and with me being gluten-free, they have an amazing selection of gluten-free options clearly laid out on their menu.  They even have gluten-free pasta for their pasta dishes!  My latest meal was the Carbonara Pasta with chicken and it was delicious.  I can't speak for the cheesecake and other gluten options, but what I've had of their entrees is really good.  Update: they now have gluten free sandwiches on their menu!  I had their smoky bacon cheeseburger with fries (also gluten free) and it was delicious!  The gluten free bun was fresh, soft and chewy.  I was so happy that I could finally eat a sandwich WITH the bread!"
Jason N.,"New Castle, DE",54,346,57,3.0,9/27/2013,"It is a standard Cheesecake Factory, it upholds the chain's reputation and fulfills the expectations.  It is great? No.  It is acceptable and reliable? Yes. Also there is tons of parking and it is attached to major mall with tax free shopping.  If you are shopping it is a step above going to the food court."
Liz L.,"Woodlyn, PA",3,84,20,1.0,7/27/2014,"Oh what has happened to the Cheesecake Factory?! It used to be a fun and delicious restaurant but the quality has REALY dropped off, and the Christina location is FILTHY! Management should be ashamed. Gross..."
