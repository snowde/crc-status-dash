Chushma K.,"Millsboro, DE",0,41,,4.0,1/10/2016,"The place ,food ,cheesecakes and the atmosphere is great ! The only drawback is that the waiting time during the weekends is too long. Had to wait for 1 hr 45 min. The food portion sizes are good and the choice of cheesecakes are amazing!"
Purpose T.,"Hillside, NJ",1159,301,100,5.0,10/21/2014,I love this location!!! There's nothing bad I can really say about TCF. The menu has great options and I have my favorites that I usually stick with. I can definitely go without the overpriced mediocre tasting cheesecake. The entrees and appetizers are delicious. The drinks are overpriced as well though. I love the food!!!
Andrew R.,"Fairfax, VA",61,157,204,4.0,8/24/2013,"As far as chains go this is probably as good as it gets.  Took my brother for dinner last night.  Service was pretty good, I had mushroom flatbread and edamame, my brother had some sort of gumbo jambalaya thing and seriously the biggest piece of chocolate cake I've ever seen.  Only lame thing was that the coffee was ice cold and I had to wait 15 minutes for hot coffee."
Sherry H.,"Elkton, MD",9,22,,3.0,12/2/2013,"Dec. 2013 Love love love!  The dishes are phenomenal!  You may have a small wait but it's well worth it! The wait staff is attentive and courteous!  Menu selections are always changing making each trip unique. The atmosphere is kind to family, business, romantic or just because visits. Update may 2015 Customer service has poorly declined.  My last 2 visits were horrible!  The last one resulted in emailing corporate.  Changed from 5 to 3 stars."
H S.,"New York, NY",0,6,2,5.0,2/2/2015,"Casual yet elegant modern decor. Very friendly happy helpful staff. Delicious casual food. The food is nicely presented and very creative, southwest nouvelle cuisine  at it's best. Everything is fresh and colorful, taste buds party."
Shelly C.,"Pennsville Township, NJ",164,120,1299,3.0,4/13/2013,"My favorite foods here are the Chicken Bellagio, Herb Crusted Salmon, Factory Chopped Salad, Factory Burrito Grande and the New England Clam Chowder. Favorite drink is red sangria. My favorite cheesecake is the peppermint bark hands down. I love the versatile menu however sometimes I think it hampers the food execution. I remember having a dish that was intensely overpowered by garlic when CF first came to the Christiana Mall-I believe it was the pasta carbonara. I prefer to get take-out or sit in a booth because the restaurant otherwise is extremely noisy & not very private."
Sarah S.,"Lincoln University, PA",4,32,3,2.0,6/3/2014,"Why do I keep giving this place second-chances with their steak? I've been here TWO more times since my last review and both times I got well-done despite asking for medium. I've tried almost each steak they offer and each one comes underseasoned and overcooked. I could do a better job myself for half the price. The most recent time, two other party members got well-done steaks and burgers despite both asking for medium-rare. We got free dessert for that one. I can appreciate the effort they're putting in, but that cook has some problems or is intentionally wasting their money."
Sean M.,"Odessa, DE",16,8,,1.0,7/13/2012,"I have been slowly trying to ween my family off chain restaurants and my latest experience at this one is a good reason why.  We went here on a Thursday night for a dessert treat.  Something about and $7 slice of fatty cheesecake appeals to my wife and kids while my wallet silently weeps. Service: for once we didn't have to wait 2 to 3 hours to be shuttled in a cavern of restaurant.  (Everyone table's conversation is amplified, jumbled and combined into a unpleasant roar.)  We sat down, ordered, and somehow it took almost 10 minutes to slice $21 worth of cheesecake (3 slices) and bring it to the table. It may sound petty, but if I am ordering around 3000 calories of cheesecake at a price that could feed a family of four for dinner, you better ridiculous white pants/shirt combo in high gear and serve those slices of cake quickly. Attention to detail: The waitress came back to see if my family were enjoying thier fat-pills and she boxed and bagged my daughter's leftover slice of cake.  This morning, my daughter naturally wants her cake for breakfast!  (I'm guilty of leftover chinese food for breakfast) Now what reminds me of stoner McDonalds workers spitting in the food was the layer of macaroni noodles crushed into the base of her leftover cake????  Really?  Price:  For reheated frozen food, this place is a joke!   Overall: a perfect match for Christiana Mall and its consumers.  The only positive thing about my visit is that I no longer have to hear my kids suggest going there ever again."
Victor B.,"New York, NY",4,183,,5.0,8/2/2015,"Came here on a busy Saturday night. They have practically everything you want on the menu. Ordered the chicken with bowtie pasta and garlic sauce, it is very tasty. The portions were huge, had to actually take some home in a to-go bag. Much better selection and quality than Olive Garden. Original cheesecake was creamy, and sweet."
Lisa L.,"North East, MD",0,20,,4.0,10/4/2015,Had a great lunch there yesterday! Ordered the chicken avocado sandwich and it was outstanding .... so much in fact I wish I could have ordered one to go!
Sara R.,"Kennett Square, PA",0,1,,3.0,10/1/2015,I was impressed that the manager reached back out and invited me back for another try at her cost.
Amy H.,"Newark, DE",0,6,,5.0,9/23/2014,"I always get the chicken lettuce wraps! Three sauces come with the wraps and it is so good! Healthy too! Ps, share with someone, it is pretty big! Haha"
Monique V.,"Winter Park, FL",7,4,,4.0,5/31/2016,fav!  love the chicken piccata and the bread there.  always tastes good.  service is top notch....can eat here everyday.  portions are huge.  always have leftovers for the next day!
R. K.,"Broomall, PA",0,36,,4.0,10/24/2012,"I've been to this location and other Cheesecake Factory locations multiple times, and this service has been consistent across the board, as well as the food. You can get stuck in an hour plus waiting time, if you aren't careful. I would say lunch would be the best time to avoid that or a later dinner, but I have seen the lunch wait get a little long...maybe not an hour wait though. The good news is, you can stalk patrons in the bar area, as that seating is first come first serve, and I've had decent luck doing that at other locations.  Also, the portions are very large. The lunch pizza and salad is VERY filling, as well as the pasta, and Renee's Special (half of a turkey or chicken salad sandwich, a salad, and the soup of the day. If the soup doesn't sound like one you want you can substitute for fries). My only ""gripe"" has been that the last couple of times I have been the caesar salad has a lemony taste to it, even my mom noticed it. Not sure why that it is.... People really shouldn't complain about the calorie count or the price of the cheesecake. First of all, it's at a restaurant, so anything here is going to contain more calories than if you made it yourself, it's the reason you shouldn't eat it every day! Is $7 steep for a price of cheesecake, I guess that depends on who you are asking. If you had one of their drinks at dinner, you probably paid about that for it. Basically, you wouldn't pay that much if it wasn't delicious.  Overall, this is one of the better chain restaurants you could go to."
Anne Marie S.,"Manayunk, Philadelphia, PA",183,32,8,1.0,12/31/2013,"Extremely poor customer service by the location manager. Had a coupon emailed to me for two free slices of cheesecake.  Went to redeem it today and the manager insisted it wasn't good until the new year.  Proved to her that it was 12/26 and she said it doesn't matter ""I don't have the button, go call corporate!"" Will not be returning."
Shante M.,"Fayetteville, GA",0,15,3,1.0,11/7/2013,"I would make it a point to stop here for brunch a few times a month, but I stopped. The service is poor and the servers do not treat EVERYONE the same! I ordered breakfast potatoes with my brunch meal that tastes like they were cooked next or with meat. I do not eat red meat or pork. When I told my server that the potatoes tasted like meat and weren't  good. She said ""Oh yeah they cook potatoes on the same grill with the meat!"" Then she walked away and did not come back for at least 20min, She never offered to correct the order or asked how we liked everything. Additionally she didn't refill coffee or our mimosas at all. That was my last visit. I know go to brunch at Michele's in Dover Downs cost way more but food and service is better!"
Danielle R.,"Bear, DE",115,3,8,3.0,10/19/2013,"My hudband and I have been here a number of times.  This time my eyes were opened. We were at the bar.  Ester was a wonderful bartender.  Then the man sitting next to my husband happened to be the manager's friend.  The manager came up and told him he would get him a table even though the wait was 30 min.  With 2 min the manager came back  the friend was going to a table.  I thought it was rude to make people that had waited 30 min for a table, wait even longer because a friend walked in. Watch who is  being seated before you when you go here."
Jesse A.,"North East, MD",17,219,75,5.0,2/19/2012,"After several attempts getting in before with no luck (1-3 hour wait), we went on Valentine's Day. The wait was 30 minutes so we took our pager and sat at the bar. As it turns out we just drank and ate our meals right there! Not only was it quick but while sitting at the bar you get served better than a waiter/waitress tending to 5 tables.       Jambalaya I had was great and my Fiance said her Steak Diane was also awesome! The Cheesecake we took home was of course the best you can get anywhere. The wait is bad but everything else is top notch!"
Kelly R.,"San Jose, CA",156,131,192,2.0,7/15/2011,"After hearing so much about the Cheesecake Factory, my family and I decided to try it out for a late lunch. We arrived at around 3, so we did not have to wait. However, it seems that an hour+ wait time is not unusual.  The menu was gigantic, with many options to choose from. We ordered nachos for an appetizers and received dry, sad looking nachos with zero taste.  When we all got our meals, we all agreed they were very bland (we all got different meals) and disappointing. With all the hype this place seems to get, we were all expecting the food to taste good. We decided to try the the cheesecake, which was good but not great.  I felt the prices were too high for the quality we received. The wait staff was okay, and the place was clean and had a nice ambiance. Other than that, I won't be back and I'm not sure I want to try another location after this experience."
Janet P.,"West Grove, PA",0,22,,4.0,5/4/2015,My first visit tonight with my sister. We arrived at 4pm so was seated immediately & service was very good. She had Steak Diane and I had the Chicken Madeira.  We both agreed that dinner was very good.  My asparagus were perfect crisp tender and the mushrooms done lightly sautéed. It was excellently prepared.  I would definitely go back again.
