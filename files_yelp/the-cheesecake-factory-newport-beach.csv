Barb W.,"Rancho Mirage, CA",94,117,23,4.0,12/28/2017,"Received a holiday  gift card for Cheesecake and was initially reluctant because I perceive this brand as a food mill for masses rather than a pleasant dining location. The entrance and hostess stand were bustling with lots of people waiting for a table. It took us 15 minutes to be seated, not bad.  Although there were literally people at every booth and table, the space is not cramped. Each table has enough space so that you can hear each other and no one else is on top of you.  The menu is extensive. The burger, lettuce wraps, and kids corn dogs were all really good and served quickly. Portions are huge! I suggest sharing, as the appetizers were even too big for a meal.  The server was efficient. He definitely had a churn and burn style - no time for small talk - but he got the job done.  Overall this was a great experience. Surprise!!"
Lisa G.,"Lancaster, CA",0,5,,2.0,1/5/2018,"Meh! Generous portions (of blah!). Too large a menu for the kitchen to properly embrace apparently.  Like some restaurants in retirement hot spots, I think they take advantage of older people for whom it is difficult and intimidating to speak up when served old (not necessarily spoiled) food which has been carelessly thrown together.  We are talking seriously mediocre salads at lunch time. The beets were canned not roasted as promised!! Eew!  I could see the indentations from the can on them!! Yuck!! I had the fresh vegetable salad with grilled chicken. It could more accurately be described as the ""Whatever Vegetable Matter Salad with refrigerated cold grilled chicken laid on top for an extra $4"". The grilled chicken had an unappetizing whang to it. (The large chicken salad in the refrigerated case at Starbucks for $7.45 is far superior) My meal was a real bummer!  At $15+ at the Cheesecake Factory I was hoping for something delicious and fun to eat. This was the sort of nonsense I would expect on an off night at Denny's.  On the positive side, at least no one got sick."
Khalid A.,"Pomona, CA",0,25,8,1.0,1/3/2018,"I know this location gets a lot of tourists and is really busy most days, but for god's sake smile and be nice it's your job! Usually I enjoy the service at a Cheesecake Factory but this one in Fashion Island always seems to be miserable and you can definitely smell the racism on a lot of the customers here.. In all other branches except this one, I always feel comfortable and welcome by the staff. The food here is good, servers are rude and sad. Will be back because the view is nice, I hope to change this review at some point."
Derrick B.,"Huntington Beach, CA",27,210,46,4.0,12/22/2017,"I especially love the view of the ocean no matter where you sit, they have staggered the seating in a way that every person can see. This location is pretty high traffic so be prepared for a wait time. I've never come and just immediately seated which is a downside. Plan ahead!  The service is what you'd expect from the cheesecake factory and their menu items are also consistent across the chain which is comforting that you know the food will always taste the same for those hungry days that you already know what you want. I'm also vegan which can be a challenge but their menu is diverse enough that i can substitute or just order one of the vegan items wish is the Vegan Cobb Salad."
Lyn D.,"Brooklyn, NY",11,189,57,4.0,9/15/2017,"Really can't go wrong w/ Cheesecake Factory to tell you the truth. I was starving!  Ordered Sangria, beet salad w/ goat cheese, and buffalo wings! It was served quickly, and our waiter Tony was hella cool! Satisfied, quick service, great day!"
Ben B.,"Chicago, IL",241,880,2909,2.0,11/3/2017,"It's terrifying how bad my spicy crispy chicken sandwich was. Let's start with the bun. It was stale and flavorless. The melted cheese? Not even fully melted. The breading on the chicken slid right off at the slightest provocation. And the chicken itself tasted pretty bad. Even the side of fries was flavorless. What's perplexing is that my table even spoke to a manager type who dropped by to tell us about the extensive quality control. He mentioned how the managers are constantly testing the food. We watched as he informed a chef that his pasta water needed more salt. So if they were that hot on quality control, how did something as nasty as my chicken sandwich hit my plate? And if the quality control was that high, why was there a sticky gunk on the spoon that was part of my place setting? On the plus side, the Oreo cheesecake was good."
Marilyn M.,"Long Beach, CA",38,8,3,4.0,12/21/2017,"This was my first time at a Cheesecake Factory! Foodwise it was great. I had the Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta and, while it wasn't spicy at all, it was tasty. My lemon raspberry cheesecake was amazing, but, unfortunately, I had to take it to go since they took so long just getting our entrees out! We arrived and were seated by 2pm, but it was 3 o'clock before anyone came to apologize for the delay. Also, felt a little neglected by the waitress, who we had to stop for water refills. Staff was nice and the food was good, but the wait time was just way too long. Hopefully, I'll have a better experience next time!"
Jasmine C.,"San Diego, CA",481,190,734,3.0,7/31/2017,"I love eating at the Cheesecake Factory but I don't know why every location I go to, their customer service sucks. Our hostess was not friendly. All the staffs looked miserable working here lol. They need happier employees!  Came here for national cheesecake day. Slices are half off but dine in only. I was expecting a 30-45 min wait but it only took 15 mins!  Tried the truffle honey chicken. The chicken had a nice crunch, was very moist but was a little too salty for me. The mash potato was salty too. Salty+salty = no good  The fried calamari was good and crunchy. Great for sharing."
Kat F.,"Lake Forest, CA",0,16,37,5.0,1/2/2018,We sat at the bar and Kevin is an excellent bartender. He had great recommendations and made fantastic drinks very personable and wonderful service! Thank you Kevin for making us feel welcome and happy!! We came back again and again to see Kevin and the beautiful views from the bar! Really delicious food.
Jeff L.,"Lake Forest, CA",3,765,204,4.0,12/15/2017,"This Cheesecake Factory is located in the Fashion Island in Newport Beach. It is slow food. One of the tourists of our party wanted a place with an ocean view, and this one more or less satisfied that requirement other than that the curtains were down so we had to see it through the filtered curtain. The prices were rather high but I didn't pay, so that's not my concern. The food tasted pretty good, including the cheesecake that one of my other party members ordered. It came out at a medium speed. My tourist friend took advantage of the brunch menu and even their small order sated their hunger and they were happy with it. There were two PokéStops that were touchable from inside, but Pokémon density, even after putting a lure in, was not very high. The restrooms were nice.The doors to the restroom were heavy."
Linda R.,"Torrance, CA",56,96,411,5.0,9/21/2017,"Who doesn't like happy hour?? Best time to go to Cheesecake Factory in my opinion.. great prices, quick service. Go alone & make friends or take friends and let's have a party!  Sweet corn tamale cakes are my go to favorite and at $5.95 it's a bargain... many more things but you can't go wrong with anything.. to be happy.. fill your belly and smile!"
Christina K.,"Whittier, CA",112,124,45,4.0,8/10/2017,Came here a couple Sundays ago with my hubby and 5 month old son. I ordered the cobb salad and a glass of red and he got a burger (you can take the man out of In&Out but you can't take the In&Out out of the man) and a couple margaritas. He said the margaritas were OK and that the burger was pretty good. I was pleasantly surprised at how large the lunch portion salad was. It had plenty of blue cheese and chicken so that's an A+ in my book. I was also really happy with how accommodating they were to my hubby and our little one and his stroller. Will definitely be back.
Travis M.,"Costa Mesa, CA",0,15,1,5.0,1/4/2018,"We have Cheesecake Factory cater our company holiday party every year that feeds about 50 hungry clients. The food is consistently wonderful, but this last experience was so great it had me leaving no choice but to come sing praises on yelp. Considering how above and beyond the on-duty manager was at the time, I should definitely remember his name, but Ron (or Rob) was there for me every step of the way. I placed a $1400 catering order and told him I needed it by 11:30 am which is around the time the restaurant opens. Any other restaurant would have told me it was impossible to pick up an order that large so early, so I was fully expecting to hear the same this time. Instead, I was assured it would be no problem. At one point the day of the pick up I was so nervous it wouldn't be ready I called to confirm and a gal on the phone told me to come in a few minutes later just to make sure the order was completed. Ron (or Rob) immediately called me back and said ""your order will be ready at 11:30, we don't mess around!"" I showed up at 11:30 sharp and sure enough - all 15ish bags of my food were freshly prepared and ready to go. To take this entire process one step further, he even got a crew together to help me carry all the items out to my car, himself included. Now this is the type of customer service I would never come to expect especially from a large corporate restaurant, but Cheesecake Factory is setting a new standard both with their friendly, hard working, efficient, sincere staffing, , and their food quality. Thank you GM Ron (or Rob) for providing me with a restored faith in catering cuisine, and I'm sorry I don't remember your name!"
Brandon H.,"Kansas City, MO",133,100,210,2.0,8/3/2017,"It pains me to give such a poor review to one of my favorite chain restaurants. This review is specifically for this location.  We arrived with a party of nine, but because of the long wait (1.5 hours) with a party this big we decided to split our party so we could get a seat earlier.  As we waited for over 30 minutes we watched parties of four and five come in and get seated almost immediately. This was perplexing, as we have been waiting for a while to be seated. When we discussed the situation with the employee, she was very condescending and handled the situation very poorly. We were eventually shown to our two different tables.  As for the food: I always get the chicken belagio and have never been disappointed ... until this visit. The noodles looked and tasted as if they had sat out for awhile, there was hardly any sauce on them, and the sauce that was on them was not the same as the sauce I have had on it dozens of times before. It was simply substandard for this chain. My wife and I were very disappointed.  I think this location could use a new hostess and new chefs. Management would do well to look into these issues."
Ramy G.,"San Diego, CA",20,9,,2.0,11/29/2017,"So we had some visitors from out of state and we wanted to take care of them and show them a good time! We requested ""if we can please"" be seated outside in the balcony (outdoor), the MANAGER tells us ""why would you? It will be sunset and you won't see anything?"". Umm, how about it's non of your business??? They told us it might take more waiting time, we told them we understand. We waited for like an hour, until it was really dark and we gave up and told the lady we don't mind anywhere as long as we don't wait anymore, but the host became all defensive and she was like ""BUT YOU TOLD US TO PUT YOU OUTSIDE!"".  Love CCF but hate this place! Never again!"
Claire R.,"Irvine, CA",0,2,2,5.0,11/26/2017,I highly recommend the crispy pineapple chicken and shrimp meal. It had a various amount of flavors incorporated in the dish. Little things like the cilantro in the rice made the meal flavorful. 10/10
Stephanie S.,"Los Angeles, CA",571,246,208,2.0,6/22/2017,"Update: The response from Corporate was a bit disappointing. This review is for their takeout service. I called in to ask about their soup and salad lunch special ($8.95) and ordered from the choices I was provided by the associate. Upon picking up my order, I noticed that I was charged $19 for my soup and salad. When I asked about it, the cashier said rudely, ""This IS the lunch soup and salad."" I left thinking it was probably just a misunderstanding, but my coworker and I were both taken aback by the service we received. Unfortunately, the food quality was also disappointing. My $12 chinese salad was just chopped lettuce, chicken, literally only 2 mandarin segments, a few slivers of shredded cabbage (you couldn't even see purple in the salad), and an entire bag of fried wontons strips.  Overall, I was incredibly disappointed with this order and experience, as I usually enjoy dining in."
Mich M.,"Costa Mesa, CA",7,79,104,4.0,10/15/2017,"Farfalle garlic pasta has better taste than pasta carbonara. Both of them taste great though. Service is okay. Because it was busy, we had to wait for our server for a long time.  This restaurant has become my favorite when i crave for pasta. Pasta here is better than Maggianos'."
Grant L.,"Felton, CA",67,3,,1.0,12/16/2017,"I went here with my wife looking for a nice date night. The service we received was awful. Our server never filled our drinks once, leaving them completely empty for the entire meal. Never checked on us during our meal. We sat ready to go with our credit card on the table after our meal for an additional 15 minutes. Overall disappointing experience"
Maggie C.,"Los Angeles, CA",3683,2700,11555,3.0,3/21/2017,"We went to the Cheesecake Factory at Fashion Island for our Sunday Brunch.  Bruleed French toast: extra thick slices of rustic French bread baked and grilled golden brown, topped with powdered sugar. The french toast was kinda good at first. I got tired of eating it after a while because it's super sweet. Sweet bread + powdered sugar + maple syrup = dentist's best friend. Bacon: I wish the bacon was cooked crispier.  Omelette with English muffin & tomato: the omelette and the muffin were served lukewarm and even borderline cold. The cheese inside the omelette didn't even melt!!! Our waitress was nice, but non attentive. We had to ask for everything and she almost never checked on us.  3 stars!! The Cheesecake Factory is almost yummylicious!!"
Nadia G.,"San Diego, CA",4213,331,209,4.0,3/12/2017,"This review is a 3.5   As with all cheesecake factories, took forever to get seated. The staff are slow in taking your order and bringing bread and water to the table. The restaurant itself is very nicely decorated, has a wide selection of choices on the menu and the food is very good."
Rish A.,"Newport Beach, CA",112,62,17,5.0,9/18/2017,"Had the Asian lettuce wraps and it was really good! Hadn't been to a Cheesecake Factory in 20+ years and was pleasantly surprised at how I've overlooked this place all these years.  I think the large-ness and franchise-ness of the place is a turn-off, but I'd be willing to try other things on their menu and I bet I would enjoy the food."
Mimi D.,"Newport Beach, CA",0,13,1,1.0,10/10/2017,"We have been a fan of Cheesecake Factory for the longest time. However, after our move to Newport Beach we decided to go the nearest location i.e. Located in fashion island.  We have been here few times despite very average customer service and food because it's the most convenient for us. however our recent visits made me write this review. It's the worst Cheesecake Factory we have ever been. After waiting for 45 minutes the food came cold, much smaller portions then any other location we been to and to top that a shambolic customer service!  The manger of this location should be fired for damaging the reputation for one of our favorite restaurant chains."
Tiffany J.,"Rowland Heights, CA",441,129,212,5.0,2/24/2017,YELP 100 CHALLENGE 15/100: Went here on Valentine's Day with my bf: -Fast service  -Lots of options of food ( I wanted all of it) -huge variety of drink options    Food was good; server even asked about how I liked my drink. I wasn't as satisfied with the drink so she gave me more of the strawberry purée so it tasted better.
Zack M.,"Irvine, CA",0,6,,1.0,10/12/2017,"To Guest Services that's in charge of overseeing reviews and responding to every review except for mine: great job on ignoring my review and failing to ensure that somebody cared to reach out to fix a problem that fell on your employees. I am so glad I haven't returned to this location since my horrible experience a couple months ago. See my previous review and many of the other recent low star reviews as this type of service they treat their customers. *As a quick summary of my previous review, the food brought to the table was wrong 2 times before the third plate that was finally brought out to be correct, the fire alarms were going off the whole time (I have video proof), and there was no sincere apology or accommodation for a mistake on the staff's end."
Bebe A.,"Garden Grove, CA",116,8,3,1.0,12/5/2017,"Ordered buffalo wings, so disappointed, they were burnt to a crisp! Had them delivered so I couldn't send them back!!! Would not recommend. So I had no lunch! So angry and hungry = HANGRY"
Linda C.,"Costa Mesa, CA",793,255,830,2.0,7/8/2016,"Usually never go to Cheesecake Factory, but decided to come here for dinner and ended up very disappointed in service. [WAIT TIME] Came here for dinner and the wait was about 40-45 minutes. Got to walk around Fashion Island to kill time so the wait didn't seem too long. [FOOD] - Deep fried mac n cheese balls: DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THESE. Perfect amount of batter, the mac n cheese inside was absolutely delicious! Creamy and cheesy, not dry at all. - Pasta Carbonara with Chicken: The garlic parm cream sauce was incredibly oily, and not creamy at all. The pasta was dry and oily, and the chicken was overdone as well. Definitely don't recommend it. - Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta: the spicy chipotle sauce was delicious, and the chicken wasn't overcooked in this dish! Would recommend it. I usually go for the classic cheesecake, but we decided to try the key lime cheesecake and the salted caramel cheesecake. Definitely LOVED the salted caramel cheesecake!! Would recommend that one or the classic cheesecake. [SERVICE] Once we were seated a server came up and took our drink orders. After she returned with our drinks we asked for a couple of minutes to take a look at the menu. When we were ready to order I tried to wave our server (or any server for that matter) down for a good 10 minutes. I was very disappointed at how inattentive they all were. Once I finally got someone's attention, we ordered. They brought out our appetizers immediately, but we waited another 20 or so minutes AFTER we finished our appetizers for our pasta dishes to come out. It also took a while to wave down a server to get the check as well. Will not be returning to this location."
Kate M.,"Costa Mesa, CA",0,3,,1.0,12/27/2017,We had 12 people for dinner and they messed up 5 of the orders. They don't keep their restrooms clean. And they act like they are doing you a favor to seat you after you wait an hour & 1/2. Save your money. Go to BJ's instead
Katie C.,"Costa Mesa, CA",0,2,,5.0,12/20/2017,"One of the best Cheesecake Factory restaurants I have ever been to. The service is always prompt, food is always made fresh and hot. Every server I have ever gotten was always pleasant. The wait time is always less than 5 minutes even at its most busiest nights (Fridays & Saturdays). I live in Los Angeles now and make the drive to this location because it never fails me."
Brianne N.,"Irvine, CA",145,91,138,4.0,1/30/2017,I've been a long term Cheesecake Factory patron. This branch is pretty consistent with others branches. I haven't eaten at this particular store too often. I do like to get cheesecake to go here.  I recommend the mango key lime and Godiva. I just tried the carrot cake cheesecake. It was pretty good. I think if you feel like carrot cake just go for straight carrot cake.
Samer A.,"Los Angeles, CA",7,42,104,1.0,8/14/2017,Service sucks I have waited for good 10 Min before I got someone to step in and help me out to get my order ? Seriously I had to make the effort to talk to person who had me seated and  ask her to get me a waiter. Very bad start I know but food is ok but mash potatoes were cold and the bread as well.I had hibachi steak with mashed potatoes and asparagus.Now going back to the person who had me seated she made me wait for 3 Minutes for nothing because there was a plenty of empty tables and it was around 10 Pm which is late dinner on a Monday ( Not busy Daah)???!!!! I am really disappointed with this branch and the poor service and the spot that I got seated at which is going to make anyone normal to become cluster phobic.
Stacy H.,"Orange, CA",1,3,,1.0,12/8/2017,"Went ahead and ordered food to go approximately 2 hrs before they closed and verified and repeated my order to make sure that it was correct. Once I arrived in which was a 20 mins drive, I tried to check if my order was correct and the person whom attended me insisted me to not check it because it was ""correct and no need to do so "" . So I leave and 20 mins later after I arrived to my home I see that the order was completely incorrect. Meaning wrong entree's (we ordered chicken madera , and chicken bellagio) they gave us scraps of chick nuggets with fries and dried up shrimp with mashed potatoes  I drive back (another 20mins) and let them know and they said they couldn't redo my order since they had already closed the kitchen . This was 40-50 mins before the restaurant closed . I asked to speak to a manager since I saw people walking in to be seated and the stated that he couldn't assist me due to the same reason. I gave up at that point and asked for a refund instead and the manager refused because ""once the food is made it's non-refundable"" and as well because his register was also closed . After that a cook just gave money from his own wallet to tell me what they we doing wasn't fair .  I refused the money and left with no food and no money back .  I love Cheesecake Factory but after this visit I refuse to go back or have any of my family or friends go.  Horrible horrible management"
Kim W.,"Lake Forest, CA",0,4,,2.0,12/17/2017,Just left the cheesecake factory this evening. Service was slow and the kitchen was even worse. They literally brought our three meals and three different times to our table. Some of the meals had clearly been sitting under the hot lights and others were cold. This place needs to get its act together
Margarita S.,"Newport Beach, CA",51,15,1,1.0,5/19/2017,"We are normally fans of cheesecake either going there to dine in or for take out which we do often.  We ordered through postmates yesterday and had the absolute worst experience.   First of all the food was late.  According to post mates it was Cheesecakes fault since the postmates was waiting for 45 minutes in their lobby.  We literally had to wait an hour and 20 minutes for our food.   We ordered bistro shrimp pasta - that was actually good, beef medallions- HORRID!   I asked for medium and got burnt well done.  It also looked like a piece of leather that had been sitting out for awhile, and fish and chips- the fish was good but the chips were nowhere to be found.   It took too long and when we got our food it was extremely disappointing.    Once again, you guys are normally great but yesterday was a definite fail."
D A.,"Covina, CA",0,2,,3.0,10/30/2017,"The food was alright, the beer is overly priced one beer was 6.50... I could buy a six pack for 6.50-7$ and the cheesecake they gave me to go was so small. But other than that wasn't bad"
Eddie A.,"South Lake Tahoe, CA",11,4,,1.0,5/15/2017,"Ok ....so we are at dinner in Newport Beach @ Cheesecake Factory .. service is pretty BAD from our surfer waiter ... I ask him if he went on break bcuz he never came to fill our glasses, clear our tiny table of extra plates we didn't use, my app came 15 min before my daughters Sienna's, then our dinner shows up with her app .... I asked the server what the heck happened - first he said oh fried food comes from 2 different kitchens , I replied that both our appetizers were fried - he shrugged his shoulders and replied  .... I just ring it in dude and walked away  The manager Lester came and asked what happened, we explained and he was very dissapointed !! At this point he took care of our table for the most part and gave us a discount ... he was amazing .. but shame on the server for just not caring at all ! If he didn't feel like working today, he should have stayed home"
Shawn C.,"Newport Beach, CA",197,12,1,2.0,10/23/2017,Absolutely awful wait times. Not enough staff on board to handle their volume of orders. Food is good but they have major managerial issues at this location
Anita K.,"ENCINO, CA",228,117,283,3.0,6/6/2017,"Came in at a busy time, but got seated promptly. On the flip side our dinner took forever to come out. The complimentary bread was extremely hard and crunchy, almost hard to eat. Wasn't the fresh warm bread that you would expect to come out at 6pm for dinner. No problem, we waited for dinner instead, and waited. My go to dish is their Sante Fe salad which was drenched, and drowning in dressing. It was the point that you could even taste the salad ingredients but just a sharp cilantro dressing. I was hungry to I ate it, no time to take it back and remake one when you've waited over 30 mins. My kids enjoyed their chicken strips and fries, with the best Ranch dressing on earth. No cheesecake this time but their selection is out the world. Personal favorite is Red velvet and cookie dough. Make sure to order light, and beware of humongous portions if you want to walk out without food coma, and want to save room for dessert."
Estefania A.,"Anaheim, CA",72,6,5,1.0,7/22/2017,Worst service ever. The staff is unfriendly. Our waitress didn't come to check on us AT ALL. Took our order brought our food and never came back. On top of that rude. Never coming back to this specific location. The food was also cold. Not worth your time. Take your business else where.
Michelle L.,"Irvine, CA",154,123,371,3.0,4/9/2016,Slow service. Probably some of the worst service I've had at this location. I waited a long long time for my food- at least 20 to 30 minutes. I ordered the hibachi steak which was very good. Totally surprised by that. Wasabi mashed potatoes though so- be aware. They are spicy hot. I like this location and the overall menu but the service on this occasion was pretty bad. It was almost impossible to find the waitress to get a drink refill. I saw a lot of standing around over by the kitchen so I'm thinking the kitchen was running slow? I don't know if that's a good excuse.  I'm hoping for a better experience next time.
