Wayne B.,"Irvine, CA",0,6,3,4.0,4/22/2016,Nice place to have dinner with delicious food. But you have to wear warmly if you plan to go there in the evening. At least 30min waiting time if go there on weekends. But worth the time!
William H.,"Las Vegas, NV",122,62,27,4.0,8/22/2015,"Nice visit, staff was friendly and it was busy. Food was great. Habachi hanger steak was as delicious as any high end place. After driving all over Newport looking for a spot everyone liked, and actually leaving one we sat down at, the CHeese Cake factory was perfect. Even had some nice craft beers, Firestone 805, nice to see them getting in to the beer boom. Located in Mall."
Viann C.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",220,124,287,3.0,9/14/2015,"Ok not sure what it is about the Cheescake Factory lately, but I was not a happy camper today!  We made the reservations last week for a large party of at Noon.  We were celebrating a birthday!  When we arrived, they could not find our reservation and then proceeded to ask us if we made it at another location. Duh?  They were able to seat us...probably because the restaurant was not busy at all.  Wonder why?  It took forever for our food to come out and the dessert menu. Of course, we had to have a piece of cheesecake.  Geez!  Plus, what is the deal with the water?  I ask for water and usually end up drinking it all so that I do not waste it (we are in a drought people). But then why do they keep filling it up?  Now, I have to drink another glass of water.  Ugh!"
Marina B.,"Irvine, CA",1,17,4,5.0,6/29/2015,"On the Father's Day we went to The Cheesecake Factory at Fashion Island, it was crowded, but as we were two we didn't wait anything. When we got to our table the waitress was really kind and friendly. She helped us to choose, giving us great suggestions and explanations. We ate the culotte with fries suggested by her, and it was amazing. For the dessert we had a 30th anniversary cheesecake, also suggested by her and one more time delicious! This one definitely entered on my list. Loved the service and the food. Great place!"
Courtney C.,"North Park, San Diego, CA",486,451,300,2.0,6/11/2013,"Meh. I felt the need to write a few 2 and 3 star reviews to counter balance my 4 and 5 star ones. The Cheesecake Factory immediately came to mind as a good ""meh"" place to review.  I'm definitely a bit of a health and food-quality nut so this review is definitely coming from that perspective. I also tend to not be a fan of inauthentic ethnic foods and places that try to do too much. The Cheesecake Factory falls into the negative bracket of all of these things to me.  The Cheesecake Factory to me is also representative of a lot of annoying American attitudes.  Attitude #1: More is better. More is not better in my book. More is wasteful. More causes obesity. The Cheesecake Factory's portion sizes are way too big. I say, moderation is the new excess. Embrace it!  Attitude #2: Quantity over quality. Lots and lots of food doesn't mean its all that great. Butter and salt are not a substitute for high quality food and legitimate flavor.  Attitude #3: Food-like products, especially diet ones, are a good way to lose weight. This couldn't be farther from the truth. Your body needs and craves legitimate nutrients. Not Skinnylicious salads with processed dressing and crappy meat.  I also just really don't like supporting huge corporations, so there it is. Support small-businesses! Support the Thai mom and pop shop giving you a real taste of Bangkok in your backyard or the 30-something trying to make his dream of owning a bar come true. Support the business owners that put lots of love and hard work into their businesses. Just my two cents."
Lisa S.,"Santa Monica, CA",1,11,,3.0,4/10/2016,"The food is good, not great, for the price, which was $90+ for one appetizer, two meals, two soft drinks, and one dessert. The dessert was very good - strawberry shortcake - not an easy find!  Everyone likes the brown bread and avoids the hard, not crusty, small white loaf of bread served along with it. It should be replaced asap or just not served. My guess is at a lot of it is thrown away each day."
Anna M.,"Costa Mesa, CA",0,5,,2.0,10/8/2016,"I came to this location to eat last night hoping for better service than what I normally get inthe HB location. Boy was I wrong. It was crowded, granted but the service was sooooo slow.  Food was ok but I swear it seems fresher at the other location."
Bongiorno M.,"Newport Beach, CA",87,357,504,4.0,11/8/2014,"A staple and business model of how any restaurant should be run and pump profit: Great Ambiance, Friendly Service, Fast Service, HUGE Portions,  HUGE Selection,  affordable prices and top tier desserts and select entrées. I rarely eat at chains, however when I do it's ""The Factory."" BONUS: Where can you find a better cheesecake..."
S S.,"Irvine, CA",0,35,,5.0,9/16/2016,"Awesome food and server!! The servings are more than enough and of course the cheesecake is fabulous! We were seated immediately for lunch and lucky for us, we chose the table with the BEST server, Shelley(20 yr employee) who knows all menu items by heart!!"
Carrie W.,"Newport Beach, CA",13,3,13,4.0,11/6/2014,"Living in Newport Beach means you get the surf and the sun, but you have to get used to a lack of late night dining options. When it's past 10 pm and you're in the mood for something a little more classy than drive-thru, don't forget about Cheesecake Factory!  After a late movie, we racked our brain where to go. We remembered Cheesecake Factory and I'm so glad we did. Service was amazing. For 11:30 at night she could have just done her job and I wouldn't have been offended. Instead, our waitress was attentive, sweet, and best part, never rushed us at all. Food was standard Cheesecake Factory fare. The novel -- I mean, menu -- is always a bit much to get through but you can't say they don't give you options. I chose the mushroom and chicken lettuce wraps from their ""healthier"" menu and they were good, filling but not too heavy. Nothing too remarkable. The four of us also split their pumpkin cheesecake and good lord. It was perfect. I guess you hope it would be though, they are a Cheesecake Factory first and foremost... Anyway, food was about a 3 but the amazing service took it up another level. I probably wouldn't come here all the time but it's definitely my go-to late night dining establishment from now on."
Farzin Andrew E.,"Irvine, CA",76,47,13,4.0,1/22/2015,This was my first visit here. Loved their $5 happy hour menu from 4-6 pm. Make sure to try Avocado Egg Roll.
Kim S.,"Cary, NC",1,17,6,1.0,2/28/2016,"Terrible service, long wait for food, had to ask for silverware. Just 3 of the problems we encountered on this visit. Will not be back. Oh  and the restrooms were awful. Come on Cheesecake Factory! Clean up your act"
Shannon C.,"Garden Grove, CA",87,41,9,1.0,12/11/2015,This is the WORST Cheesecake Factory EVER!!!! Our waitress barely talked to us and we had horrible service. Then the waitress charged my card TWICE!!! I called and spoke with the manager and was told it would take 2 to 3 business days to refund my account. Are you kidding me???!!! Do not go to this location.
Mojdeh S.,"Seattle, WA",300,735,895,3.0,12/9/2014,"How I heard of this place: The first time I learned of the Cheesecake Factory was from my sister, Mojgan, years ago. This Cheesecake Factory is no different. Type of cuisine: A typical corporate-style chain establishment, with a variety of options including pizzas, salads, burgers, and pastas in flavors inspired by Mexico, Italy, North America,and beyond . Ambiance: A large establishment, with high ceilings, yellowed walls and decorative glass light fixtures, both hanging from the ceiling and on the walls. Dark brown, wooden backed booths and chair-table seating (in the bar as well) can be found throughout the small spaces created in the venue. Music plays in the background on this evening, sometimes loudly, as the hustle and bustle of restaurant spaces can be heard and felt. Patrons are not shy to speak to their dining companions aloud, but rarely do conversation topics make it to the neighboring tables. The staff, clad in white jeans and button-up shirts, white aprons and shoes are never far away, very friendly and eager to please. At the entrance, like other Factories, hostesses smile behind a large wood and granite slab-lined podium, awaiting the name and number in your party. As you wait for your name to be called, one can visit the cheesecakes and seven-layer cakes on display at the take-away counter, or make your selections for dessert! The tiled floor always sparkles with shine, as your party is guided to its seats. Tall, green plants create a sense of nature in an otherwise dimly-lit, modern-Romanesque setting. Windows along the front side of the establishment look out over the beach, and the beautiful summer sky as it changes from blue to orange to pink with the setting sun. What I ordered: Upon being seated, I knew Mojgan needed an order of the Avocado Eggrolls ($9.95), so I immediately ordered those, and three glasses of water without ice, before even taking a glance at the menu. When my two dining companions took their seats, we also ordered the Buffalo Blasts ($9.95) to start. The Avocado Eggrolls, always a hit between my sister and I, served over a bed of crispy rice noodles, include avocado, sun-dried tomato, red onion and cilantro fried in a crisp wrapper and served with a tamarind-cashew dipping sauce. The Buffalo Blasts, a new favorite, include chicken, cheese and spicy buffalo sauce all stuffed in a spiced wrapper and fried until crisp, served with celery sticks and blue cheese dressing. For our main entrees, my sister and I shared the Cajun Jambalaya ($16.95), the CFs most popular pasta dish! Shrimp and chicken are sautéed with onions, tomato and peppers in a very spicy Cajun sauce and served over rice. Our dining companion ordered the Fresh Grilled Salmon ($19.95) with mashed potatoes and large spears of asparagus. For dessert, we left the ordering to our dining companion, who enthusiastically ordered the Ultimate Red Velvet Cake Cheesecake ($7.95), with moist layers of red velvet cake and the Original Cheesecake covered with special Cheesecake Factory cream cheese frosting. He also chose the Dulce de Leche Caramel Cheesecake ($6.95), caramel cheesecake topped with caramel mousse on a vanilla crust. On a return visit, Wednesday, June 5, 2013: A new SkinnyLicious menu drew our attention with a Grilled Turkey Burger ($9.95), minus the bun: combined with fresh mushrooms, garlic and spices, served with grilled onions, lettuce, tomato, mayo and a green salad, and a Turkey & Avocado Sandwich ($9.95): freshly roasted turkey breast, smoked bacon, avocado, tomato and mayonnaise on a toasted bun, served with a green salad. My husband continued his deep-fried frenzy with the Fried Chicken Salad ($13.95) complete with mixed greens, tomato and green beans, topped with grilled corn, glazed pecans and honey mustard tossed with a house-made Buttermilk-Black Pepper Dressing. We completed our scrumptious late lunch with the new Oreo Dream Extreme Cheesecake: Oreo cookies baked in the Cheesecake Factory's creamy cheesecake with layers of fudge cake and Oreo cookie mousse, topped with a milk chocolate icing. What I loved: The two appetizers were absolutely tasty and full of rich flavor. The spicy buffalo blasts, served samosa style, and the sweet sauce over the creamy avocado rolls were the perfect start to breaking the second day of the Baha'i Fast. The salmon was soft and tender, light, flaky and fresh, and paired well with the creamy, buttered mashed potatoes. The asparagus served crispy and lightly salty. I really enjoyed the spicy jambalaya, with marinated chicken and tender shrimp, fajita-style vegetables and full of flavor. Of the two desserts, the dulce de leche caramel cheesecake won my vote, even though I could barely eat more than two bites. Why I loved it: The portions are huge and the food consistent from Seattle to Las Vegas, from Orange County to Bellevue. Cost: Average ($9.95 - $19.95 per entree)"
Tommy S.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",160,36,,4.0,4/1/2016,"I mean lets be honest, this is THE Cheesecake Factory. It doesn't get better than this. My personal favorite is the fresh strawberry, because I am a basic bitch. But ALL of them are heavenly. In addition to that, I always feel hella swag going in there. The atmosphere is very refined for a place that serves fried mac n cheese, which essentially describes my personality. It is a bit pricey, but when you go you make an event out of it. The staff at this particular one are quick to answer, very efficient, and most importantly are very very nice! Especially the ladies at the front who get the cheesecake! Love them :) keep up the good work!"
Dean I.,"Kailua-Kona, HI",41,115,175,5.0,2/11/2015,"Really nice staff, and nice ambiance too! My s'mores galore cheesecake was awesome... Wish I could sample more..."
Maureen C.,"Fairfield, CA",176,405,541,4.0,2/27/2013,"I would have to say that out of all the Cheesecake Factory chains, this would have to be the better one.  While some of the newer CFs are larger and seemingly fancier, I would have to say this place still holds a special place in my heart.  Lots of fun lunches/dinners with good folks here.   It's also a good spot for some good shopping and wandering around.  Love the chicken farfalle, miso salmon, and wasabi crusted ahi tuna. mmmm. And of course if you want to top it off with a gorge fest there's also the cheesecake which is just evil...like the red velvet cheesecake...white chocolate raspberry truffle... dulce de leche caramel...and mmm everything as well."
Elle C.,"Irvine, CA",63,670,605,5.0,10/15/2011,"I've been here on many occasions. Fun location and fun atmosphere! Our recent visit was simply for desserts -- and a cocktail.  The Ritz Martini (with Champagne) feels absolutely pampering and festive!  The towering Strawberry Cheesecake served as quite the finale! We've found the food consistently tasty here.  The service on this particular visit was especially great!  Our server allowed us to take our time; he was amazingly professional, friendly, and efficient -- making our dining experience extremely enjoyable!"
Thomas K.,"Aurora, IL",8,47,82,2.0,8/6/2014,"Food is great, especially Jamaican shrimp! Food quality is pretty consistent (above average), but every Cheesecake Factory I've been to appears to have service issue. Service could definitely improve."
Kayla Q.,"Irvine, CA",99,266,203,2.0,7/15/2014,"I find the Cheesecake Factory to be overrated and overpriced. Food is pretty good, nothing spectacular and the same goes for drinks. Cheesecake is good, and they have great freshly made salad dressing that you can buy jars of to go. Happy hour is nothing great here."
