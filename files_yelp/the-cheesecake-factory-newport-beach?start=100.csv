E G.,"Costa Mesa, CA",0,16,,5.0,3/10/2017,Mindy is the best server! She's so friendly and happy it's contagious and makes me enjoy my food that much more!
Khrystina R.,"Santa Ana, CA",22,19,,3.0,8/18/2016,"Not recommended for big parties.  Smallest location I have been to, wouldn't take a phone reservation for a party of 18. Wait was roughly 1-1.5 hrs.  Typically wouldn't wait or would have gone elsewhere but it was the birthday girls choice for dinner. 2 waitresses were assigned to our table but check out took forever."
Madison V.,"Valley Glen, Los Angeles, CA",2,19,11,1.0,11/20/2016,"Soooooo fuck this place. Our group came here after a conference so granted we had a huge party but we called ahead several times asking if they can accommodate such a big group. They said yes so we all came here, split into smaller parties and got seated that way. My party had 8 people and it took them one hour to seat us. When they finally seat us, they split our group saying they don't have enough tables to seat us together. They showed us a table of 4 and a small booth with silverware for 3. There was another table of 4 RIGHT NEXT to the the other table which they could've easily put together to accommodate us. Instead, they stick 4 of us in a tiny booth for 3 and didn't even give us extra silverware until we asked for it after getting our food. This is how a group of people of color, some queer and trans, get treated in this place.  The food isn't even that great. The farfalle with chicken and roasted garlic was dry and didn't even taste like it had garlic. I had a bite of my friend's chipotle pasta and the pasta was undercooked.  On top of everything, while waiting to be seated for AN HOUR, we got nasty looks by other customers. We even heard someone referring to our group as a zoo.  Ummmmmmmm bye Cheesecake Factory. Keep your mediocre ass food and you can have this one star review too."
Soomi P.,"Irvine, CA",489,473,92,4.0,7/9/2016,"I love this Cheesecake Factory location. The staff is always friendly and attentive, food is good, and the overall ambiance is great too. The to-go staff also deserves a shout-out. I frequently get to-go dinners from this location and they are always super courteous and make sure I get everything I need."
John S.,"Phoenix, AZ",7,203,17,1.0,1/28/2017,"I used to come here regularly in 2015 and 2016 and it was great. I came here today and the service has really taken a nose dive. I was ignored for 10 minutes at the bar area and when I requested a seat, I got one and was ignored there for another 10 minutes. It wasn't any busier than usual so all things considered, something's happened here that has tanked the employees' motivation for customer service and courtesy. I'm curious to know what."
Ornah L.,"Long Beach, CA",209,15,22,1.0,5/1/2016,"I am SO irritated! This is our favourite Cheesecake Factory location. We drive all the way down the coast from Long Beach to visit here, and we are frequent customers. Tonight we took our friend who is visiting from out of state down the coast to birthday dinner here. We stopped at the beach to enjoy the sunset and listened to the waves. We took our time because we had looked up the hours on the website and it clearly stated that this location closes at 11pm on Sunday. We walked in at 10:06pm only to be told they were CLOSED! I asked for a manager and the guy went away and came back apologetic, but no manager. He said we could still buy cheesecake. We went to the cheesecake counter figuring we'd at least buy our friend a piece of cheesecake for her birthday. Nobody could be bothered to help us for another 5 minutes. We asked for a piece of cheesecake, one guy turned around, told us they were out of that one, then went back to what he was doing, with no intention of helping us at all. Finally, I decided to ask for a manager. I showed him the website info on the cell phone. He was apologetic, but did absolutely NOTHING about it. This is not the level of service or professionalism that I have come to expect from The Cheesecake Factory. Another couple had also been standing there waiting to be served. They were equally annoyed by this guy's obvious lack of manners. He sent us off to the Huntington Beach location with what essentially amounted to a shoulder shrug.  We asked the manager to call the Huntington Beach location since we knew it was going to take us half an hour to drive BACK to Huntington Beach, and we'd be arriving at 10:45pm. Upon our arrival at the Huntington Beach Cheesecake Factory, we asked if they'd received a call saying we were coming. They had not."
Melis E.,"San Juan Capistrano, CA",0,10,2,5.0,3/26/2017,"This is the best Cheesecake Factory I have ever been. The atmosphere is very cool and best for the celebration or dates. 30th Anniversary Chocolate, Oreo Cheesecake are my favorite. We would definitely come back at this place again!"
Jonathan G.,"Fountain Valley, CA",37,51,21,4.0,8/22/2016,"Happy hour here always hits the spot. Friendly staff (Ryan B) and an extensive and satisfying menu for minimal prices. Always get the buffalo blasts, zucchini, nachos those items never disappoint and today i tried the fried mozzarella but i wasn't a fan."
Jon O.,"Long Beach, CA",62,140,68,4.0,6/12/2016,"Solid experience as expected from CCF. My tamale cakes were piping hot and excellent and the cheese cake was good, along with the service. I'll definitely come again as its a good joint chain."
Wid M.,"Costa Mesa, CA",6,13,6,1.0,8/2/2016,This used to be a 5 stars restaurant for me until I found a hair in my soup which was really gross I'm very disappointed.. Never going back again  Little updating :  Well again I decided to give it another chance I went today ordered pasta de venci and guess what !!!! I FOUND ANOTHER BLACK HAIR IN MY PASATA this place is sucks I would never ever go back
Brittani H.,"Newport Beach, CA",10,7,,5.0,2/6/2017,I come here for happy hour pretty often and always have a great time. The bartenders are attentive and welcoming and I always leave full!
Julie P.,"Irvine, CA",3,15,2,3.0,8/1/2017,"I'm giving 3 stars, but these are for the food, certainly NOT the service.  This is the 2nd time I've been here, and both instances were take-out.  I let it go the first time, but on my 2nd trip I need to get this off my chest.  Both times, the kids working the to-go counter (which doubles as a dessert set up station) are literally in some kind of 'zone' .  On my 2nd visit (Saturday, 7/29) around 2pm.  I stood at the order desk for almost 5 minutes before anyone acknowledged me.  Finally one of the dessert gals said she'd 'go back' to find the cashier to take my order (gee thanks).  Finally the cashier comes out, no hello, no 'sorry for your wait' - basically a blank stare.  ""May I get the chicken parmesan to go please?'- again...blank stare until he replied ""the chicken sandwich?""  Oh it gets worse.  He rings me up and tells me 15 minutes.  I take a seat on the bench...people come and go for the restaurant seating, but I am the ONLY person sitting on this bench for the entire time.  After about 10 minutes said employee brings out a to- go bag and places it on top of the glass showcase holding the cake samples....and says nothing.  He continues to come and go from 'the back', and never once looks my way or calls me up.  Finally after about 20 minutes I get up, and say ' can you tell me how much longer for my order?', at which time he grabs the bag that has been sitting on the showcase for at least 10 minutes now.  Man I flipped my lid - he says 'oh yea, I didn't see you sitting there'.  OMG!!! Management - take a few minutes of your day and monitor this location in your restaurant!  It is sorely lacking customer service. PS - on both occasions your hostesses had zero personality also."
Tanya C.,"Walnut, CA",1,43,16,5.0,9/4/2016,Love this Cheesecake Factory. Went on Saturday at 4ish it wasn't busy and the service was good. I had two waitresses and they both were excellent. Food was good as always and best of all you can walk around after and shop your heart out and walk for exercise. My kids love eating here to because of the cheesecake and the atmosphere We always do Valet parking it's the way to go. See you next time CF.
Lance M.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,2,,1.0,8/7/2017,Went with my family at 11am for lunch at we were told we had to wait 30 to 40 minutes. Looked around and there were plenty of tables. That's unfortunate! Maybe management should reconsider adding more staff if that's the problem.
Yas A.,"Newport Coast, CA",76,21,67,3.0,3/13/2016,"My cousin and I hit up our regular spot...  We started with their complimentary bread [btw their bread is to die for] She got the Santa Fe Salad which included: Lime-Marinated Chicken, Fresh Corn, Black Beans, Cheese, Tortilla Strips, Tomato and Mixed Greens with a Spicy Peanut-Cilantro Vinaigrette. (she opted for no beans and it was still great) I ordered the Macaroni and Cheese Burger which included:Charbroiled and Topped with our Creamy Fried Macaroni and Cheese Balls and Cheddar Cheese Sauce. Served with Lettuce, Tomato, Pickles, Onion and Mayo. ( I substituted a salad instead of the fries). Ive always written about the amazing salads and burgers at cheesecake, however I wasn't a fan of this particular burger.. Maybe too savory, but I liked the side salad and the Santa Fe Salad ( had a bite of the cousins food)."
Megan J.,"Riverside, CA",39,221,529,2.0,10/7/2015,"My husband and I were in fashion island and we had a gift card to The Cheesecake Factory, so we decided to eat here last night.  We came in and were seated shortly. I wished that things had been a little cleaner. It looked like the booth hadn't been wiped off after the last group of people left our table, so there were crumbs everywhere. There was also a bunch of food gunk inside my menu which was gross. Every menu should really be wiped down after every use to ensure that there is no food on it.  For my dinner, I got the margarita pizza and a side of macaroni and cheese. I thought the macaroni and cheese was very good. It could have used a little more flour for the cheesy sauce to be more consistent. It had a creamy thinner sauce at the bottom of the dish, and the cheese was stringy on the upper part. Overall, it was good though and served hot. My margarita pizza was okay. I wish it had been hotter. The crust could've been crispier. But I enjoyed it. My husband had the Old Fashioned Burger. He requested that it be prepared medium rare, but it was more like medium well to well done. He explained to our server that he was allergic to onions and garlic and we were told that my husband's burger was without any garlic or onion. I think there might of been some sort of seasoning in the burger patty itself though (maybe some onion or garlic powder), because my husband started to react as if he were having a mild allergic reaction. After dinner, we had the red velvet cheesecake which was excellent. It wasn't too rich when you split it. It was part red velvet cake, part cheesecake and had cream cheese frosting and white chocolate (served with whipped cream).  Our server was pleasant and got us everything we needed, however, towards the end we became slightly disappointed in him. We told him to use up the gift card and then to split the difference on the credit card (which I admit, can be confusing if you use the word ""split""). He returned it to us and the entire check had been split in half (half on the gift card and half on the credit card). We tried to track him down for a few minutes and we told him that we were very sorry, but we wanted the gift card to be used for the full amount and then we wanted the remaining balance on the credit card. When we asked him to please correct this, it was clear that he was frustrated with us and he responded with, ""Well you said to split it in half"" (in a frustrated tone). We definitely did not tell him to split it in half. I explained to him that we said to use up the gift card and then split the difference on the credit card. He corrected it and then just kind of dropped the book on our table and didn't make eye contact or say anything. My husband and I felt very awkward and weird that our server would get so frustrated with something like this.  I do not think we will be back to this Cheesecake Factory."
Shayla L.,"Costa Mesa, CA",238,2,,1.0,8/7/2017,This was an absolutely miserable experience I have ever had at a Cheesecake Factory. We went to dinner with a group of 7 of us and it took well over an hour and a half to even get our food. When our food came to our table every single one of our plates had something wrong with it. Then they told us they would comp our cheesecake for all of our troubles but when the bill came only 2 of them were comped. We ended up spending over 2 hours there and none of us were very happy. I definitely will not be coming to this location ever again.
Andy T.,"San Jose, CA",0,7,,1.0,1/20/2017,I ordered two slices of cake 30 minutes ago. I don't believe it takes that long for someone to slice me cake. Instead I am sitting here looking at customers after me receive their desserts first. Lack of customer service. Wouldn't recommend this location to anyone. Management needs to prioritize their time on relearning what customer service means.
Hashanah555 K.,"Newport Beach, CA",64,281,549,4.0,9/25/2015,"Dessert for lunch was our theme. Banana cream pie cheesecake was ah-mazing. The apple crumble was gi-normous, especially ala mode. The passion fruit martini was just ok. But service was excellent, no matter how busy and bustling the restaurant was. Restrooms were very clean."
Lori K.,"Costa Mesa, CA",69,2,,5.0,7/31/2017,"I've gone to cheesecake for many years and every single time I've gone there and sometimes get different people that wait on us - but every single person that works there has always been the best of the best, the service is impeccable and they work very hard to do the best. The staff is friendly, I've never had a problem, the hostesses have always been nice to me.  I've never had a problem. I've never seen any staff member unhappy or unfriendly, just want to do the best service.  I've gone at lunch and dinner. I always said - If I accidentally ordered the wrong meal, any meal is so delicious - it wouldn't matter. The price for the food is great, where would you have a great meal for such a good price. !  Nice atmosphere next to the beach, you can see Catalina island from the bar area. And for the cheesecake, yum !  I would prefer to pay a quality price for something that tastes delicious. Sometimes it not the money, its the memory of enjoying a good meal with friends, family and the people you care about."
