Cecy C.,"Tustin, CA",43,12,6,4.0,1/1/2017,"This Very simple I had a good customer service I ask giving me time to choose my drink waitress come back on the perfect time ( sometimes if you ask for a time they take for ever to come back to take your order) so food the best sangria I drink before , food everything great guacamole salad,melt veggie sandwich yummy!!."
Sokha S.,"Irvine, CA",19,53,,1.0,6/20/2016,I am always on the lookout for new places to try lettuce wraps. This place was an epic fail. The lettuce was mostly stem. The chicken mix was mostly filler with rice sticks and very little chicken. Someone in my party ordered a flatbread that was completely dominated by ricotta cheese and little of everything else. Their Greek salad was awful as well.
Rebecca W.,"Rowland Heights, CA",327,227,434,3.0,6/9/2014,"Outside: clean and pretty. On fashion island too. Inside: if you walk in from the shopping side,  you'll enter the front where you tell them the amount of people you have/etc. But if you entered from the outside parking part, the first thing you see are stairs. Really beautiful. However, this confused me because it was my first time there so once I walked up, I had no idea where to check in. I stood there for a few minutes before some one told me it was in the right. Lol. Overall, the interior is big and pretty. Nothing to hate about. Service: the employee were really nice.  I believe the waiter that helped us throughout the night was called Rick?  He was friendly and very understanding. nice fellow.  Food: (don't really remember the names so I apologize beforehand)            Got a combo which was Steak Diane with shrimp scampi with mashed potato, caramel pecan turtle cheesecake, vanilla bean cheesecake.              The combo was good but as usual, more mashed potatoes than steak and shrimp. The steak part was good. The sauce was delicious. The shrimp...was meh. I took one bite and bam, I felt full. I felt like the shrimp was buttered too much or something.  Not sure but the more I ate it, the more I didn't want to eat. Potato was ok. Nothing to really hate beside it taking up most of the plate.                Caramel pecan turtle was good. But it was a bit too sweet in my opinion. The vanilla bean was perfect though. Soft with both vanilla and cheesecake taste while the other cheesecake was stronger on the sweetness. But this is just my opinion.  Overall: this place is pretty and the service is good too. However, even though I enjoyed my dinner there, this isn't the place I'll continuously go back to.  I'm not really a fan of the food because it makes me full really fast (I believe yahoo news mentioned cheesecake factory's foods has one of the highest calories). However, as I said before, it's only my opinion. But I do believe it's worth a try to come here."
Alyssa S.,"San Dimas, CA",1,6,,1.0,1/17/2017,"I came here with my mom, sister, and grandmother on Saturday 1/14/17. We normally visit the Rancho Cucamonga location and have had nothing but great experiences here.  Everyone but my sister's food came out, and the waiter then said they did not have the ingredients to make my sister's salad. This would have been fine, except the rest of us already had our food. I find it hard to believe that they only realized they didn't have the ingredients until everything else was out.  My sister ordered a different salad, which took forever to come out. They gave my grandmother the wrong dressing on her side salad and no one came by to see if everything was okay so she couldn't return it.  Our waiter disappeared without saying a word after he told us they couldn't make the first salad, and we were left with multiple other people who came by occasionally, but not when we needed anything.  They didn't even seem sorry that they messed up, or offer to take the salad off the bill or offer dessert. Which was not what we were looking for, but it would have been a nice gesture.  Overall it was a bad experience. We've never had an issue like this before at other locations so it was definitely an upsetting out of the norm experience. Very disappointed in the service and lack of organization at the Fashion Island location."
Fiona X.,"Cypress, CA",78,140,57,5.0,8/27/2015,"Totally in love with their wheat bread roll!  I go there about once a month and just LOVE their wheat bread, the ones they serve before your meal. I've been trying to buy them, but they dont taste as great as cheesecake makes it. anyway, its in fashion island, and theres a great view in the restaurant if you sit near the window. You would be able to see the ocean! Not many asians come here to eat, but I'm one of them. I can understand how some servers aren't very welcoming, because some Asians dont tip, but i do~ well too! Overall, the service is alright, depends on the server really. Food is great! Great variety of food, the whole family can eventually find something they enjoy~ I always go with the Avocado Eggrolls, and BBQ ranch chicken salad + miso salmon. Highly recommend their Miso Salmon! and chicken bellagio pasta! Although there's a great choice you can choose from, most of what I tried were really tasty! LOVE LOVE LOVE their wheat bread! Hope they can make it sell-able in the future! Can't seem to find it anywhere else~"
Gulia T.,"Santa Ana, CA",3,28,14,5.0,5/23/2016,"My friend invited me there to celebrate my graduation. It was Sunday, lunch time. The line was so long! We were offered sitting places at the bar table. We were so hungry after shopping around at the Fashion Island; therefore, we decided to agree for that option. It was for better. We were seated right away. Also, the view was amazing! My friend ordered wraps, they were so delicious. I ordered salmon, which was pretty much good. The best part was, of course, cheese cake! Yummy! They have various kinds of cheese cakes!"
Theresa R.,"Newport Beach, CA",0,21,1,1.0,6/7/2016,"I went for dinner and ordered the dirty martini.  It was more than dirty, couldn't drink it but charged for it. I switched to a Kettle and soda that was so weak I asked my server to have the bartender taste it. He came back with a proper V/S, but I was charged another $9.50 for it. Crazy, I got one good drink and paid for 3.  Then my salad came. The Chinese chicken. I tasted a couple of the fried rice noodles and they tasted like OLD frying oil. I took them off my plate. There were still a few in my salad and I went home with this weird oil film in my mouth and an upset stomach all night. No manager even walked by to speak to me. No manager visible anywhere. My server had too many tables. It's never relaxing to watch people run around like that. Being in hospitality myself, this was really bad. Put a manager on the floor!!!!"
Chasity T.,"Westminster, CA",216,117,124,1.0,3/28/2016,"Pretty upset, I'm a huge fan of Cheesecake Factory but I just waited an hour for a half order of salad because the pasta station in the kitchen was backed down. They could have at least told me, instead of me asking my waiter over and over. I had to talk to the manager and she was not helpful at all, she kind of almost seemed mad I was asking why the food was taking so long. Not only was I upset the food was taking long but we had a baby with us, and you know baby's can't sit still for long. I've usually had good experiences here but today was a huge no. My mom ordered a pasta entree and they didn't even start on it the whole time while waiting. This isn't cool. Besides that, the male hostess was very kind and understanding on why we left but there was younger female who walked both me, my mother, and little brother to the table who rolled her eyes at us. Not professional what's so ever"
Gretchen R.,"Tustin, CA",3,32,11,4.0,7/30/2015,"Pros: Good food and great portions. I have never been disappointed with any meal I've gotten from here. Our server was really busy, as were the others, so it was understandable that our exchanges were very concise. She asked what we wanted and we got them right away and that was that.  Cons: The prices and gratuity. Well, the prices aren't too bad because you do get a nice large portion and today was National Cheesecake Day or whatever and all the cheesecake were half off, but every little thing you order adds up in the end. When it comes to gratuity and tips, I understand that servers get really busy and have to deal with all types of people but I don't understand why it's almost mandatory to give such a large tip. They already get paid by the restaurant to serve, do I really have to pay them a tip that's the same amount as a full meal?"
Nancy J.,"Costa Mesa, CA",0,8,5,5.0,12/20/2016,Had lunch here with my sons. Was so yummy. The service was the best. Sit in stacy's section. She is amazing!!!
Kevin P.,"San Diego, CA",1,3,,4.0,12/3/2016,"The food was seriously good, I got a cheesecake, and a a pasta. Highly recommend if you want good food. Service was pretty slow though."
Shoshana C.,"Newport Beach, CA",13,3,,2.0,12/17/2016,I am a big fan of this chain restaurant and this used to be my favorite location until last week. Last Tuesday my cousin was in town and we were in a mood for desserts so we swung by the CCF and ordered a white chocolate raspberry cheesecake and a carrot cake. Well as we were about to enjoy our cheesecake we found a bug between the whip cream and the crust. We talked to the manager who was apologetic but the damage was already done. We were allowed to leave without paying for our coffees and desserts we ordered; that courtesy and the manager's apology were the only positive things we got out of this awful experience.
Shauna S.,"Salt Lake City, UT",51,1108,595,4.0,3/12/2016,Hmm. Same good food. Restaurant in a mall which is normal for CF. But I'm not used to steep stairs right in the entrance. And cigarette smoke. And dirty carpets. And tiny dining space.
Jane C.,"Newport Beach, CA",2,12,,2.0,11/16/2016,"Came here because we had the kids and high hopes for a decent family dinner.  Service was slow and unenthusiastic.  My California guacamole salad was sopping wet. the avocado was black at the edges, it was all one mushy consistency.  I had salmon on top which was mostly edible.  The best thing of the night was the kids' Mac and cheese.  Cheesy, al Dente elbows.  My husband has falafel salad which has nice kale greens, the falafel was tasty but mushy.  Will not be coming back."
Deran C.,"Irvine, CA",486,146,201,4.0,1/21/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory has good food and is a very good restaurant. The only thing holding this establishment from a 5 star rating is more attention to service and the customers. The staff at Cheesecake knows their food tastes great and it does, but with more attention to customer service this could be one of the best chains around. When I went to The Cheesecake Factory, I ordered the sample platter for the appetizer which came with a variety of egg-roll-like appetizers and 4 unique sauces which was very nice, and accommodated everyone at the table. For my entree I ordered the Steak Diane cooked medium rare and it was cooked to perfection. The medallions paired with the traditional mashed potatoes and mushrooms was very well executed and I would definitely order it again. For my drink (yes I'm mentioning my drink) I ordered A strawberry lemonade, meaning only one. I say ""A"" because when I finished the waiter never came to ask me for a refill, and I know I could've asked for one but the staff didn't fill any of our drinks when they were empty unless prompted. Yes I know I'm being picky because the service was still good, just not exceptional. In conclusion, the food is so good that honestly any other issues just seem to disappear and do not come close to outweighing the high quality of food that was provided. Great establishment and I do hope they remain open for years to come."
Jane H.,"Long Beach, CA",81,149,1395,3.0,2/22/2014,"Like all the Cheesecake chains, you know the food will be consistent and this trip was nothing new. The salmon was good and cooked to my liking however there must be a heavy handed bbq sauce guy in the back! Too much sauce on the fish! However, the corn thing - a - ma - bop was tasty. The endive salad was good also, although there were a few too many wilted salad pieces on my dish, it was still enjoyable.  The carrot cake was yummy. Perfectly spiced and not at all overly sweet, Cheesecake made the icing do all of the sugar killing. I ate around the icing though! Service was decent, the server did a good job with his recommendations and made sure the drinks were always topped.  What kills my ears is when they placed a young child and a baby next to my booth....kids are great until they wail their little lungs out and that's what happened.  They are however in the process of remodeling so it looks a bit crappy in the inside."
Jeannie C.,"Irvine, CA",56,123,280,4.0,12/4/2014,This is one of many of my favorite restaurants because of the friendly staff members and quick service. Their food is great and portions are huge which I love (bang for your buck!) Their cheesecakes are amazing but I can never finish one because they are so decadent.  Today was an off day for the staff it seems. The front desk girl pretty much ignored me and chatted on the phone with her back turned to me for about 5 minutes. She turns around and doesn't ask or say anything. I tell her table for two and she grabs the menus and walks off not even telling me to go with her. I follow behind and as I sit down she plops the menus I'm front of me and the other plate and leaves without another word. Rude.  Besides this everything else was fine. The manager eventually came by to get our feedback after we mentioned it casually to our waitress. Everything here is pretty good. eventually maybe I'll try everything on the menu haha.
Sawme S.,"Newport Coast, CA",1,13,32,1.0,5/1/2016,Always liked the food here but my order today was something really bad - This food called bistro shrimp pasta
Billy C.,"Portola, CA",2,50,,3.0,3/27/2016,"Came for lunch with a group, our host and server was very friendly and welcoming.  The Ahi Carpaccio was very thinly sliced and welled seasoned. The dish was very light and fresh. Buffalo Wings - crispy on the outside and moist on the inside Calamari - its deep fried and crispy...enough said =) Spicy Chicken Chipotle Paste - the chicken was very tender but the dish was on the sweet side and I could not taste the spicy part of the dish. The service was great and the food was average."
Geoff S.,"Newport Beach, CA",142,69,911,2.0,9/28/2015,"An updated review from a recent experience at the Fashion Island location. Ordered the Baja Chicken Tacos, which we have gotten for years. Again, they've changed the way they prepare them, and from our point of view, this was a poor change. Granted, the prior version did have some issues with the tortillas falling apart. But they've turned this dish into nothing but glorified street tacos, with too much tortilla per bite and very little originality.   Also had the chicken bellagio and the sauce with the noodles was just too oily. Really couldn't eat the pasta at all.  The chicken, however, was good. Have been a fan of the chain for years, now not really sure if/when we'll be back."
