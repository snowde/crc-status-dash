Mia L.,"Newport Beach, CA",2,37,46,4.0,4/6/2016,"Always go with the wheat bread because its softer and tastier. I had the orange chicken, it was really good, just couldn't finish it. Ill have dinner for a couple of days. Water is good here. Service is fast and friendly."
Diane C.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",592,1015,529,4.0,11/5/2014,"I love this location and now on, this is my friend Rayleen's new favorite place.  Came here for lunch few weeks ago and she was smitten by our waiter, James P.  She took forever to eat because she simply wanted to see him longer.  lol We ordered... Peach Bellini - delicious!! Strawberry lemonade - she loved it! Mexican lettuce wraps - chicken was like eating rubber (won't order it again) Skinny Shrimp Summer rolls - delicious! Ahi Tartate - delicious! Roasted Beets with Goat Cheese salad - delicious! Crispy Crab Bites - good Pineapple Upside down Cheesecake - I took a small bite and it was delicious! That Mexican lettuce wrap was horrible!  They should prepare it differently or take it off the menu.  Also, there should be an actual salsa (fresh) since it's in a fresh lettuce wrap."
Krysti W.,"Costa Mesa, CA",17,14,10,2.0,1/2/2017,Waited about 30 minutes for our food after ordering. Husband got fish n chips with a side if mac n cheese. Kid got chop salad. Both their meals were tasty but the chicken on the salad a bit dry. I got chicken salad sandwich w a side of sautéed spinach off the Skinnylicous menu. Someone came out from the kitchen and told us our food was taking so long bc the kitchen had to remake my sandwich bc it didn't look right or something. If what I received was a remake I would hate to see what the first one looked like! My side of spinach was raw so I had to wait for the sautéed spinach which was over salted and unfortunately the best part of my meal. My sandwich was two slices of brioche bread (I thought the menus said brioche bun but whatever) with about 1/4 cup (at the most) of chopped chicken mixed with mayonnaise and a few pieces of shredded lettuce. The most pathetic sandwich I have EVER had at a restaurant. I know it's on the skinny menu but to charge someone $12 for this is criminal. They should just take it off the menu. I literally can't believe they even served this to me after making me wait and telling me they had to remake it!  Yes I ate it bc I was hungry and my husband and kid were done eating by the time I got my food. Waiter should have taken my meal off the bill bc he knew how bad it was and even said something himself. We just wanted to leave. Def won't be back to this location.
Ariel J.,"Yorba Linda, CA",5,47,3,5.0,1/9/2016,"Last night I went to dinner here and had the best experience.  Even after today I am still raving about just how amazing the service was.  Our server's name was CHRISTIE, and in my entire life I have never had a better waitress than her (I have been in customer service my whole life too).   From the very beginning, she greeted us with a huge smile and was at our service.  She brought all of our drinks right away as well as got some snacks for the little one that was with us.  As well as bringing a high chair and booster seat to ensure our comfort.  She then took our order.  She memorized everything we ordered and did not write one thing down.  From 5 different drinks, 8 small bites, 2 meals and 2 desserts.  Everything came out exactly what we ordered.  Although, they were out of the loaded baked tater tots- the manager came over personally to apologize and instead we got the stuffed mushrooms that were just as great. Even after we left, my friend left his card there and she chased us down so we would not forget nor have to make a trip back.   Thank you Christie for your amazing service and great energy.  This place is top notch.  Great food, excellent service, and not horrible pricing. P.S. This was on a busy Friday night in fashion island where every other restaurant seemed like a zoo.  They were busy, but organized and efficient."
Jae P.,"Los Angeles, CA",15,5,5,3.0,5/13/2015,"Went into cheesecake factory for dinner on may 10th. The wait was about 30 minutes. There were many people having dinners for mothers day so it was busy.  My server was Tara excellent service came back and forth refilled my drinks and did everything she can to give me satisfaction. Being former manager for many different restaurant , i could tell she was experienced and she worked hard she definitely needs promotion from being a server to at least a management position so she can teach the other novice servers i observed at the restaurant.   Food was somewhat not the quality i expected from cheesecake factory . I always get the meat loaf dinner plate. The meatloaf i got was cooked, not all the way through ti give that bit of crispy taste on the top layer of the meat and soft inside. It lacked bit of gravy . Mashed potato that i had was smaller about maybe .5 oz less than i would usually get.   For appetizer we had fried mac and cheese. The display of the mac and cheese was not the corporate standard i would expect from cheese cake factory. It looked liked just thrown on the plate. Overall food was about 7.5 out of 10  Restroom for me is important part of the dining experience. It should be clean and spotless. Restroom was not clean . I know it was a busy weekend. However restroom should be always clean . Spotless.   Three things needs to be good in my book to get a good score on fine dining status. 1. Customer service , food quality and presentation 3. Cleanness  Overall i gave 3 stars The customer service was wonderful thank you tara. And food was above average . However clean part failed . Management should be checked as well ."
Elyse L.,"Euless, TX",599,677,1990,4.0,10/27/2014,"Say what you will about chain restaurants, but I love the Cheesecake Factory. I especially love the skinny menu they created because their normal portions are crazy big. The white chicken chili is delicious but what I normally get is their marghertia flatbread and the little house salad. It's the perfect amount to leave you satisfied and still have room to share a slice of cheesecake and some coffee. The dulce de leche caramel cheesecake is my absolute favorite, but the seasonal pumpkin cheesecake is pretty darn good as well. It's really hard to go wrong with any of their cheesecakes.  Tonight my grandma wanted to come here and her and I split a sausage and ricotta pizza. They have it on the menu as a flatbread, but if you ask they will make it as a normal sized pizza for you. This location looks small from the corner entrance but once you walk past the hostess stand it just keeps going. It's in the heart of fashion island which is great because you can walk off your dinner afterwards by browsing all the cool shops."
Averi O.,"Burbank, CA",78,31,3,3.0,8/13/2016,"I used to really love your hibachi steak but will probably never order it again. The steak was rare to the point of you feel like you're eating a dead cow, ok that's not right. (I'm going to post a pic of it). I ordered it medium rare anyways! The meat was very gross! But I love the potatoes and the tempura and of course the cheesecake! So I'm happy I get all that yummy stuff!"
Conor B.,"Chatsworth, CA",163,1350,106,4.0,1/12/2015,"As with all locations for Cheesecake Factory, this location is busy. However, we came in with a party of 3 and said that the wait would be 30 minutes. I was expecting closer to 45, but was shocked to have our name called in 20! This location also does seem a bit more quiet than other locations which is a great perk.  Food wise, on par with other locations (aka overwheliming large selection) and also as always a very friendly wait staff."
Keith A.,"Oceanside, CA",703,331,5347,5.0,12/18/2013,"Great location and I love the Cheesecake Factory. Excellent tasting food, large menu, lots of options. $10 to $20. Chicken piccata, large burrito. Chicken masala, jambalaya, Kobe burger. One of my favorite places to eat out. Outstanding cake and cheesecake desserts $7 to $10. Adams pb cup, Reese's pb cup, and several others."
Joe G.,"Knoxville, TN",25,60,48,1.0,2/6/2016,"Terrible. Wait was significantly longer than what they told us. They tried to sit five of us at a four top so the servers would have to squeeze behind the person on the end all night long. Server took forever to show up to our table, took over 15 minutes to get our drinks and bread to us after ordering, never came to ask if we wanted drink re-fills and at this point we've waited over 15 minutes since finishing dinner eagerly waiting to order cheesecake. We will not be coming here again...EVER!"
Fati D.,"Costa Mesa, CA",62,19,16,4.0,6/22/2016,"Good food and pretty tight space. Their balcony is tiny with only two tables, other than that just fine and customer service is very friendly."
Valerie T.,"Yorba Linda, CA",96,153,1,5.0,7/19/2016,I'll admit. I don't eat here very often. One time in the past 17 years. But what I have done is get a slice of cheesecake to go. The staff are so friendly and the chocolate mousse cheesecake or banana cheesecake are out of this world delicious.
Darlene S.,"Olympia, WA",6,47,49,3.0,8/5/2016,"I love Cheesecake Factory, but a huge warning if you order the New England clam chowder.  It should be called rosemary potato soup.  Lots of rosemary, way too much .  Didn't taste the least bit like clam chowder and very little clams.  It also had a bay leaf in it!!!"
Le B.,"Tustin, CA",2,1,,2.0,2/12/2017,"I've been here around once a month and they have gotten my order wrong almost every time. The view is great and it's close to shopping centers. Other than that, this place needs to train their crew better in taking orders and executing it. Left hand and right hand don't know what the other is doing!!"
Nichole M.,"Phoenix, AZ",1,57,1,1.0,5/3/2016,"Pretty irritated with this location. My husband and I stopped in about 8:30pm for dinner tonight. We were greeted promptly, and then on the way to the table the greeter decided to make small talk by telling us how bored she was tonight! She said she usually works weekends so it was a far cry from her normal shifts. Hm... I work in a very well known restaurant, if one of my greeters ever said that to one of my guests, they'd be fired!  We finally get to our table, all the way back in the corner, practically on top of another table (my husband pulled our table away to give us and the poor people we were basically sitting on more room).  Server comes solicits drinks, nothing in particular, no suggestions, so we opted for good ol H20! She asks if we want bread, YES!! The bread is so yummy...if it ever arrives to the table. We wouldn't know if it was yummy, it never arrived. But do you want to know who would know if the bread is yummy? The party of 20 they decided to seat right next to us, in a VERY empty restaurant. They had bread at the table before they even sat at the table.  Server comes back and I ask if the Skinny Shrimp Tacos are fried or grilled (I should have known but yes, I asked), she didn't even know the answer!! She had to go check and come back! Still no bread. I opted to order Shrimp Scampi instead. We also at that point asked for straws and even straws took 7 minutes to get. Still no bread.  Que me being SUPER irratated at this point. Find our server, cancel order, get the heck out of there and enjoy a delicious, quiet, meal elsewhere. Very dissapointed in Cheesecake tonight. Most likely will not be returning!"
Kim P.,"Newport Beach, CA",50,20,21,5.0,1/5/2016,Holy moly! This is the best Shepard's Pie I've ever had! Delicious!!! They even made my coffee drunk with soy milk for me... I'm a happy girl
Marcus S.,"Placentia, CA",399,52,,2.0,8/23/2016,One of the worst Cheesecake Factories that I have been to. I order some food for pick up and arrive 15 minutes after I was told my food would be ready. I walk in and wait 5 minutes for anyone to walk up an help me. This kid named Michael (wears a big gold watch) helps me. I tell him I have a pick up and tell him my name.    Michael proceeds to tell me that he will go back and look for it. As I am watching starts to input my order on the screen and prints it out on the register to be made. 15 minutes pass as Michael tries to help out 3 other customers in a slow fashion.    Michael eventually sees that I am starting to get frustrated for the long wait. He then looks at me then tells me that they forgot to make my food and it will be 25 minutes.(This was all said with attitude) I ended up telling him I did not want the food and left really upset.  In the end Michael lied to me about what happened to my food to cover himself and showed the worst customer service skills I've seen at your establishment. The two stars are for all the other employees at this location that have treated me right over the years.
Nicole P.,"Irvine, CA",12,59,43,4.0,1/8/2015,Typical Cheesecake Factory experience. Came for lunch around 3pm on a Saturday and the place was packed! Had to wait for about 15 min in a crowded waiting area but once we were seated the experience was wonderful. Lunch menu is very fairly priced.  Will return again! (Parking sucks. You've been warned!)
Kayla C.,"Anaheim, CA",329,23,6,5.0,7/21/2016,"Out of all Cheesecake locations I've been to, I'd say this is the best one! The restaurant has a great view of the ocean and service is wonderful! The general atmosphere is exceptional!!"
Chapsim N.,"Newport Beach, CA",1,41,6,1.0,7/19/2015,"The food is delicious but the service will leave you completely unhappy. Its been about the fourth time my curbside order has been incorrect. I should have  double checked,  but every time i give them the upper hand it leaves me disappointed when i arrive home with the wrong or incomplete order.  Calling in does no good you will be put on hold for an absurd amount of time only to be hung up on . Calling back after that was extremely frustrating due to the fact that the male that answered acted dumbfounded by the name i was providing him of the girl who hung up on me. Its truly unfortunate that the quality in customer service at the cheesecake factory in fashion island newport beach has diminished over the past 10 years. Will not be returning again."
