Christy G.,"Newport Beach, CA",316,5,,1.0,8/28/2016,Have always had a great experience here until I did takeout. Not only did they forget to put our order in but it took them another 35 min to get it to us once we were there and the food tasted so bland and not up to standard. All management could do was say sorry. If you are going to charge a significant amount for food the food and service should live up to it and it did not here.
Erik T.,"Anaheim, CA",80,35,12,3.0,2/24/2017,"Showed up on Valentine's day, it was packed but after only waiting 25 minutes we had a table for two. Food was amazing but what was even better was the waitress who was on the top of her game that night. She knew she needed to bring her top game because it's a special night for couples and she did not hold back. Thank you to the waitress and cooks for the awesome dinner and service.  The rating is less a couple stars only because of what happened before we were seated. We were buzzed to come to the front after 15 min so we could be seated but when we handed out buzzer to the hostess she took it and forgot about us. After waiting another 10 minutes we inquired about our seats and they had been given to someone else. A manager had to step in and find us seats. This would only be a minor issue on a normal day but today was Valentine's day. Overall service would have been 5 stars had our seats not have been given away."
vincent c.,"Alhambra, CA",8,308,21,4.0,10/23/2015,"I have not been to the Cheesecake Factory in forever. Even now, though - nothing has changed significantly. This Cheesecake Factory is just like any other mall-oriented Cheesecake Factory. Most of the food is decent, but there's one dish that I remembered I liked, the Chicken Madeira. Essentially a cheese covered chicken with mashed potatoes- still good. Tremendous portions. Also had the factory nachos - it was once again, decent. Can't forget the original cheesecake, that one is a dessert must. I ended up completely full, but too full. It was tough to drag my bloated self around the mall.  Service in the Cheesecake Factory is usually always the differentiating factor for me, and our waiter was a good one."
K J.,"Orange, CA",3,215,2,3.0,12/10/2016,"My friend's choice for dinner one night. I've not been for a long time. They don't take reservations so come early or plan to wait for a table. Sometimes a long wait. This chain has a huge menu so everyone in our party was able to get something. We enjoyed appetizers of artichoke dip, potato tots and stuffed mushrooms. Go for the mushrooms as they were served hot and tasted great. The tots were okay- deep fried and served with ranch or 1000 island dressing. Boring. And I didn't try the artichoke dip- no need as I've had it a million times before (to make: 3/4 to 1 c. quality mayo + 1 c.shredded parmesan cheese + 1 can (drained) artichokes in a food processor for a few seconds until pureed - for spinach add drained thawed spinach!). Drinks were good - hubby enjoyed his Manhattan and I had a Vodka Collins. Guests enjoyed wine and Cosmos. Dinner included mushroom soup and Cesar salad (gobbled down!) for one guest; hubby and I each had the cobb salad but one split between us would have been better (salad had lots of bleu cheese and crunchy bacon . . almost too much bleu cheese) and other guests enjoyed Thai salmon. We were too full for cheesecake (thank you God) but clearly that is the reason for their popularity. Overall a reliable chain and good choice for guests who's taste preference runs the gamut. But for me I'd prefer not to waste a meal on a chain restaurant!"
V I.,"Walnut, CA",0,5,,1.0,11/10/2016,"Love Cheesecake Factory, however not this location. Service is awful.. too slow and my shrimp was not fully cooked uh was disgusting. never this location again."
Lillian T.,"New York, NY",320,186,648,4.0,2/15/2013,"Came here twice: once for a friend's birthday, and once for Valentine's Day. They don't do reservations, but the wait is not too bad. I prefer this location over the one over at Spectrum because the dim lighting makes it seem more classy/fancy. We wanted to dress up, and it seems more appropriate at this location because of the dim lighting. On Valentine's Day we came at 7:30 and waited about 30-40 minutes to get seated. It was packed and we were given these little devices that would light up when it's our turn to get seated. Pretty convenient, but I don't think you should walk too far with it. Customer service is great, but seating was cramped. It's most likely because it's Valentine's Day though. Food was excellent, no complaints there. We ordered fried calamari and spicy chicken chipotle pasta. Their pasta dishes (dinner portions) are all big enough to feed two people very well. Good experience. :)"
Anton E.,"Los Angeles, CA",427,1153,670,4.0,7/2/2015,"it sure has been quite some time since i visited the Cheesecake Factory, possibly 3-4 years!  It was a good return though, a lot better than what i expected or anticipated we had  a great waiter, friendly, efficient, and his kept distance to not keep attacking us for our orders and what not we were waiting for a few others and he brought drinks and waited until they were ready for all of us to order to start, they bring bread to the table a white french bread type and a brown bread i think honey oat or something; the white was bland dry boring but the honey oat was DELICIOUS! holy cow you don't mind many restaurants with simple but delicious breads to start! lol for an appetizer we ordered the cuban rolls, basically fried egg rolls with the filling of a cuban sandwich (pork cheese pickles ham) very tasty, perfectly fried golden brown, full of meat and flavor!  my mom ordered the Chicken fettuccine scampi..i was not a fan. it was boring, bland, and pasta tasted overcooked dad ordered the Bang bang chicken and shrimp; overall it was a good dish, but there was too much curry flavor and not enough peanut sauce nor ""spice"" my dish which seemed to be the hit was the imperial chicken and shrimp; deliciously crispy chicken and shrimp in a teriyaki style sauce, delicious veggies, everything was great! i only wish they had a fried rice option as the brown rice was dry and bland for drinks i ordered the strawberry lemonade, tasty refreshing and tart and lastly to end, we ordered a slice of kahlua coffee cheesecake; sweet, creamy, coffee-ee and delicious!  will happily return"
Nikki C.,"Newport Beach, CA",2,9,24,1.0,7/30/2016,"I placed an order to go. While I was waiting, I saw the same girl that took my order, going over another gentelmans order, by showing him each item, that was in his to-go-bag.  Then I hear her saying "" Sorry about that"".  Ok, I should have taken this as a hint, to not leave with my order, before checking to make sure it was correct, but I didn't.  My bad, because I came home with a different salad than what I ordered (and it wasn't an upgrade, it was a downgrade)  and the all american cheesburger had no condiments or fries with it.  I probably wont go back."
Polly A.,"Santa Monica, CA",0,3,2,2.0,8/9/2015,"So disappointed. First time eating at this Cheesecake Factory. Service was okay. Food was sad, just sad. Had the Garlic Noodles and the creamy delicious sauce was nowhere to be found. The waitress said they changed the sauce. The new one is noodle water, that's exactly what it is. So plain, barely any asparagus nor shiitake either. ""Extra sauce"" was more like extra salty water. Why would you make changes like these Cheesecake Factory? I'm no longer a customer. Just sad. I'm still hungry."
Jenny H.,"Santa Ana, CA",3,1,,2.0,8/3/2015,Pros - they did a good job on the food everything was delicious Cons- when the waiter came and gave me a hot plate without warning me so I end up bringing myself
Sarah M.,"Irvine, CA",246,8,2,2.0,6/10/2015,"Dont call to make a reservation or ask if it will be busy around a certain time, or someone will say that they cant tell you the future. Seriously? You dont know how busy it usually get at 9pm?  #mad"
P H.,"Orange County, CA",0,39,2,3.0,6/5/2016,"CF here and near Disneyland are regular stops for us. For over 10 yrs we've been fans of the Spicy Cashew Chicken dish. Over the past two trips, we've noticed a significant decrease in the portion size...easily 20% less. We normally leave with enough leftover for a dinner the following night. I asked our waitress about the smaller portion last night, and I just received a blank stare followed a mumble about lunch size (it was 6 pm). The price for this dish keeps going up while the portions get smaller. CF, you've lost a regular."
Bill G.,"Scottsdale, AZ",3,51,,1.0,12/27/2016,"Terrible service.  Stood trying to get a glass of wine while the bartenders talked to their friends and waitresses walked by.  Finally asked a hostess to help me, she couldn't get the bartenders attention.  Too busy socializing.  Come here for decent food but I'll warn you of the terrible service.  Still waiting for our table btw."
Erika F.,"Irvine, CA",99,37,12,3.0,9/9/2015,The food is usually good the service was ok.. Its like day time customers get no love..  First we didn't get any bread and the cup I got my water in was leaking all over me and the table. The salad was eh.. I usually get pasta and it's great! Note to self. The cheese cake is obviously a hit.. Most are great.
Sean S.,"Mission Viejo, CA",59,6,1,1.0,12/26/2016,"This review is based on service alone, or lack thereof.  After our party of 4 was seated, its took about 8-10 minutes to be greeted by our waiter. We put in drink orders of 4 waters and 1 hot tea, and kindly requested the basket of bread. 15 minutes pass, and we do not have our drinks, nor has anyone checked on us. We had to flag down a manager, and only then did we get our drink order and bread. The waiter brings our waters and says ""sorry, I am really tired today."" After our meal, we ordered a cheesecake, and a 3 hot teas. Cheescake is dropped off with no utensils (all utensils were taken with our finished meals). Sometime passes and we inquire about our tea, and we were told ""well I have about 10 other tea orders, so I will get to your order when I can."" Finally they brought three tea glasses, one of which seemed to be taken from another table as it was filthy. We had to ask three different people to finally get a clean glass. Lastly, we were given two hot water pots for the three teas, both of which were only half full, and one was cold. We called the manager yet again to inform him of the situation, however, it seemed the manager was not bothered by the dirty glass, half full and cold water pots, or the poor customer service. He promised to get new pots of hot water, but they never came out. Won't be back to this location anytime soon."
Lisa P.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,3,,2.0,7/15/2016,Starting off with the zero personality hostess to sitting for 15 minutes before we were given any water. you would think this location would offer better service. Food was just ok. My daughters fettuccine with shrimp was over cooked and rubbery. When we didn't take anything togo you think the server would ask was everything ok?
Trish B.,"Los Angeles, CA",8,110,113,3.0,4/22/2016,"The service was okay. The waitress we had was okay as well. What wasn't ""okay"" was the time frame the food came out. One persons food came out and we had to watch that person eat then another plate came out and so forth. Everyone's food should have came out at the same time or at least one right after the other. I didn't like the big time gap."
Nick A.,"Newport Beach, CA",313,125,4,4.0,5/2/2015,"We went there for a late lunch. Everything was okay. The beet salad and lettuce wrap were perfect & small portions, just the way we wanted them. Our waitress was friendly & prices were reasonable."
Aj T.,"Daly City, CA",28,3,1,2.0,5/31/2016,Beware of getting a hair in your food lol
Lana S.,"Irvine, CA",5,3,,4.0,6/24/2016,"The food is great. Depending on what day you go, all menu items are available. I ordered the steak Diane (medium) and herb crusted salmon. It came with mashed potatoes and garnished with asparagus. I enjoyed the meal an would return. (:"
