Anson D.,"Laguna Hills, CA",1,83,1,2.0,4/25/2015,"I am generally satisfied with the quality consistency of Cheesecake Factory restaurants throughout the state and in Hawaii, but this time I was disappointed. My wife and I had lunch yesterday and the food delivery was slower than usual by maybe twice as long, yet the restaurant was not crowded.  My wife's Miso Salmon was overcooked, and my shrimp in the soft shell tacos were also overcooked, giving them a tough texture.  She suggested I notify the waitress and return the dish for appropriately cooked shrimp, but I am always suspicious of getting a new dish with the chef's ""special"" ingredient.  It's human nature......"
Raymond H.,"Irvine, CA",58,343,2350,3.0,5/7/2014,"Great cheesecake, try the Adam's Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple. I am not fond of their food here because it is a factory after all and good quality food should be more personalized not from a factory.  The desserts are fantastic and they can come from a factory.  After all it's The Cheesecake Factory not the Spaghetti Factory or Pasta Factory or Chicken Factory or the million other items on the menu , did I mention this is a factory?  They even wear factory uniforms, reminds me of a research lab outfit.  What are they researching back there? This is a true F to T restaurant - Factory to Table, not Farm to Table."
Alex J.,"Las Vegas, NV",88,35,35,4.0,3/13/2015,"We showed up right around 5:30 and only had to wait about 5 minutes to be seated. It was pretty chilly where we were seated. The waiter was nice, but he didn't come by often enough. We had to flag him down a couple of times when we needed the dessert menu and the check. The food was wonderful. We got the white chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake, and it was awesome!"
Eric R.,"Oakland, CA",76,84,71,5.0,2/23/2015,Alright listen up. Come for happy hour 4-6 on the weekdays.  Order: Fried mac n cheese Nachos Buffalo blasts Spinach and crab and/or spinach and artichoke dip Sliders and egg roll type things are hella good too.  You're welcome
Michael D.,"Santa Clarita, CA",2152,1759,2038,4.0,2/24/2014,"This location is great with the exception of the relentless sun that beats down on you though the windows. If it's close to sunset, sit with your back to the window. Other than that, they have a quick turn time on service here and it's a good experience when visiting Fashion Island. One of our traditions is visiting Cheesecake after we have dinner elsewhere to indulge in that sinful cheesecake and 5-star coffee. Ordered a bunch of stuff with plenty of forks for the table and it was a free-for-all until the last bite!"
Andy D.,"Saratoga Springs, UT",197,241,222,5.0,1/17/2015,"Yeaaaaaahhhh. Who doesnt like the Cheesecake Factory?!?! Always busy, solid service, and GREAT food and dessert. AMIRITE??!?!?  I have always gotten the Pasta Da Vinci, if you haven't you honestly haven't lived. I get this everytime that I go. Who and whenever I go that is my meal. Doesn't matter which location that item is ALWAYS on point. Ahhhh makes me hungry just writing about it.  For dessert I will mix it up from the traditional strawberry cheesecake or go with the really rich Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake. MMM MMM MMm. And I dont share. Lol.  Expect a wait, expect good service & as always expect bomb food and plenty of options."
Sean M.,"Cupertino, CA",2,27,1,1.0,2/26/2016,"I went on a Friday night, and thankfully there was no wait. However it still took over ~20 minutes for the food to arrive. Food was acceptable, nothing remarkable, no complaints.  The main reason I'm giving this place one star is because our server and the how dirty the silverware was. The host was very friendly, but our server was not. He did not smile and seemed to dread serving us. One of my spoons has a dried lettuce leaf glued onto it, so I politely asked him for a new one, and he replied ""oh yea"". The replacement spoon also had something stuck to it, so I had to ask for a 3rd spoon. Ridiculous."
Anthony D.,"Newport Beach, CA",0,17,5,5.0,5/31/2016,"Fantastic staff, wonderful food, great big portions, and reasonable pricing for the food you're getting.... Oh yeah, and the best cheesecake you can find!!! Seriously, the Banana Cream Cheesecake is insanely delicious and very sweet.  The food itself is fantastic. I got the Cajun Chicken Littles. They were fantastic and the plate was HUGE!!! The staff are all absolutely great. They are very nice. I went to pick up food the other night from them and I was given an extra slice of cheesecake for waiting a long time (I wasn't even waiting that long, tbh)."
Redd T.,"Avondale, AZ",0,17,,5.0,5/29/2016,"My family and I visited CF this weekend.  The wait was quite long but understandable as we had a very large group.  We were shown to our seats by a lovely young lady who was very engaging and seemed genuinely interested in our experience.  Our wait staff was very courteous, professional and fun.  We ordered a round of cocktails and everyone was happy with their choices.  I had an amazing Blood Orange Mojito.  The food was great and again the staff was attentive but gave us plenty of space and privacy.  Kudos to the entire team.  Thanks for accommodating us."
T P.,"Chino, CA",0,7,1,3.0,5/29/2017,"Visited this location yesterday with the family. Food was delicious and service from our waitress was good too. However, taking off two stars simply because the seating hostess who lacked empathy to my mom who was in a motorized wheelchair and asked us to put it at the front of the restaurant. Firstly, if she could walk that distance would we have not done that? Clearly she is in a wheelchair for a reason and needed it to get to the table and maneuver around the restaurant. Some people need to have better training and courtesy with people with disabilities. They are also patrons and deserve to not feel shamed when they enter your business with medically necessary equipment. When we checked in we requested a table that could accommodate this and we were told ""not a problem."" In an effort to not have a tiff in front of customers I guess the hostess backed off because I was completely angered when she requested we leave the wheelchair out front. We just moved the wheelchair to the side near an empty table. A family member was trying to move it to the side and the hostess tried pulling the wheelchair from the arm, which had i not told her to stop she may have broken it. Maybe she was trying to be helpful however at that point I just preferred she not since we were handling it. Maybe this location should consider some ADA complaint tables for people who require more ""space"" for their equipment. But man way to make your disabled guests feel terrible!"
Jessica S.,"Irvine, CA",0,2,,1.0,5/25/2016,"I've came here a couple times, and I have never had bad service like I did my last visit here. My waitress (Heather) I think that's her name was probably the most lazy, and unhelpful waitress I've ever had. We asked her for a couple straws, we waited probably 30 minutes, and she never came back. Asked her again, and took another 20 minutes, just to bring a straw to our table. Our glasses were empty multiple times, I saw her look at our cups, but yet still just casually walked by and ignored it. Once we finally got our food, we were missing silverware, so guess who had to wait until our waitress decided she wanted to do her job and bring us forks and knives! She took another 10 minutes doing that, so we just sat there watching our food get cold.  Poor service, and just the fact that I was pissed off the entire time I was there makes me not want to come back here ever again."
OC M.,"Newport Beach, CA",1,18,5,4.0,5/21/2016,"We took mom on Mother's Day and got a great server.  At this location we have been lucky to get nice friendly servers.  Best seats are in the back by the window or the booths that are a step up.  Sliders are stacked 4 high, sweet potato fries come in a large bowl, so just order one, you will not walk away hungry! Good atmosphere and not too loud but always busy."
John K.,"Hesperia, CA",17,24,5,3.0,4/3/2016,I'll just start by saying the food was great. The service was very slow and we waited about 15 minutes before getting our check to leave. Was not offered a refill and the bread was hard. But I do recommend the Diane steak. That was perfect.
Mina S.,"Orange, CA",0,7,,1.0,4/28/2016,"Horrible service and food. The waitress took our order while she was standing at the POS machine. She did this with the next table to sit and it was so unprofessional to hear her yelling to the other guests while she was putting their order in. The food was TERRIBLE. Hard calamari, not even fully fried. When we were getting up to go, the waitress really rudely got in our way and snatched the check book to make sure we had paid. So TACKY!! WOW.. really Fashion Island? Do better  Never coming back"
Randy S.,"Torrance, CA",250,127,132,4.0,2/10/2014,I really enjoy cheesecake factory. And this one was just like all of the rest. Very good! I ordered the chicken piccata. Its a lightly breaded chicken in a lemony white sauce served with angel hair pasta. The sauce wasnt too lemony which is good because some places overdo it with the lemon. The pasta was cooked al dente and the chicken was very tasty. Overall it was pretty filling. They also give you bread with your meal to start you off.  My girlfriend ordered the lettuce wraps which had a Thai flavor to it. It was also very good and there was a lot of it. So of course I got to give her a hand I finishing it. :)  Did not order any cheesecake but next time I definitely will. Overall the price was more than reasonable. Solid for a not too expensive date night.
Crazyerik L.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",3,38,5,4.0,5/16/2015,"The place is very easy to reach and parking! What attract me mostly is the ocean view with sunset, humm, a little far.  The service is very polite and actually warm welcome! They all wear white looks clean and professional.  I spent many times here."
Sfd D.,"Lake Forest, CA",1,21,5,4.0,6/26/2015,Good food Close to shopping Lots of parking if u stay away during rush hour A tad bit noisy
Lam A.,"Orange, CA",1,10,5,2.0,8/25/2015,"For the first time, we leave Cheesecake Factory unhappy. We wanted to try this location because we thought it would be nice to have a meal while enjoying ocean view, but the service made our dining experience really disappointing!  Very unfriendly staff! Wow just wow how careless they are!!!! Will never be back!"
Jack P.,"Lake Forest, CA",1,39,36,1.0,2/3/2014,"I think if they are remodeling this place, they should close down the place for a month and get the job done.I have invited Some guest and lost face in front of everybody ."
Rebekah S.,"Highland, CA",56,244,8,4.0,11/14/2014,"Nothing different from any other Cheesecake Factory. With one exception. Their staircase from the lower parking lot to the main floor of the restaurant. They are DARK and unsafe. Which is how I fell down them. The whole first flight of them. So dark that I was wondering where my foot was going to land and bam there I was on the bottom of the landing. Had a bruise the size of a baseball for weeks. PLEASE get some lights in the staircase. Thank you. Other than that, I had a wonderful server, amazing food and of course a delicious slice of s'mores cheesecake."
