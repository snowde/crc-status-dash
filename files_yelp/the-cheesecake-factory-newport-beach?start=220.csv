Herlindo L.,"Carson, CA",57,88,10,1.0,1/19/2016,"Of course the food is always top notch. I just do not understand the service. My only rationalization is they have a bad manager that pissed everyone off last night right around sundown. If it was just one waiter that would be fine. But all three, plus two hostesses that act like its a chore that you dare enter their establishment. Don't get me wrong. Even the three bad waiters were competent in their duties. But they all carried the same attitude. I have five minutes until my shift ends and I can not wait. My wife claims service with a smile does not exist in the OC. I'm trying to understand why ?  Are they a bunch of spoiled brats who's parents hoarded their money so they could learn responsibility?  Who knows or understands?  Thankfully I had a gift card. Note to service. If you're not happy. Choose another career."

Henry F.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",6,69,319,2.0,7/11/2016,"We go to the CF in Rancho Cucamonga and San Diego quite often. We were staying at the Marriott across the street from Fashion Island and thought we would stop in and get some late-night appetizers knowing they have a pretty good selection. We were seated within a matter of five to 10 minutes, our server came to take our drink order and then back to take our food order.  After that we never saw him again. Our glasses sat empty for the rest of the evening!! Never asked if everything was OK, or if we needed anything. We were having a conversation when he brought the check and just stuck it in my face, we were like  OK. Needless to say he didn't get much of a tip and if I was the manager Dale A would not be serving my clients. I did give two stars because the food was definitely up to cheesecake standards the fried macaroni and cheese balls are outstanding as always!!! The southern fried chicken sliders were also very tasty and went well with the JW's Lemonade. It was too bad we only got to have one since we didn't have to worry about driving back to the hotel."
Miriom D.,"Long Beach, CA",95,83,66,3.0,7/5/2014,"HUGE MENU! I don't know how they do it.  Luv the Chicken and Biscuits w/gravy.  Luv the Fried Catfish. Tried the Shrimp & Bacon Club Sandwich but that was a ""NO CAN DO"" because the shrimp was not de-veined (cleaned)- BIG TURN OFF. So I won't get shrimp anything ever again from this location."
Lica N.,"Orange County, CA",1056,508,2582,4.0,9/27/2012,"I admit some locations are better than others and this location happens to be one of the better ones I've dined at.  You get a nice view of the pacific ocean which is a great! You really cant go wrong eating here.  They have a ginormous menu  of over 200 items.  So even the pickiest eater can find something they can enjoy.   So, they now have a lighter skinnylicious menu which offer dishes ranging in the 500-600 calories.  Its a great alternative for those watching their calorie intake.  I personally should have ordered from this menu but I didn't!  Shame on me! Garlic Noodles ~    Not what I was expecting but it was pretty damn good.  Lots of yummy stuff in here too. Its Spaghettini, Fresh Asparagus, Shiitake Mushrooms, Oven-Roasted Tomatoes and Parmesan in a Garlic Sauce.  I of course being a shrimp lover added that and got the lunch portion.  Even the lunch portion is big enough for two!  The pasta was cooked al dente and the flavor of the garlic sauce was delish. I could have ordered a cheesecake but since I didnt order from the skinnylicious menu I punished myself. Damn.  I so could have gone for their Red Velvet Cheesecake.  Next time I will pass on the pasta and go straight for the cheeesecake LOL! Eyes ~ So nice to see the ocean while dining! Nose ~  Smelling something good!!! Ear ~ Happy people eating! Mouth ~ Pastaaaaaaa!   Tummy ~ Very good lunch!!"
Jessica S.,"Long Beach, CA",0,6,,5.0,7/25/2016,At the bar with Jeremy taking excellent care of me as always!  Love the small plate options but wish there was a chicken Madeira half order! Basically wish I had 5 friends here to share my many faves!  I worked for this company years ago so it says something when you still love coming back:). Stoked to see Jeremy as always.  He makes the experience all that much better!!!!
Mrs. J.,"Santa Clarita, CA",0,54,3,3.0,8/7/2016,"Fine as far as cheesecake factories go. 30 minute wait on a Friday at 8pm. Service was a bit slow, never offered appetizers or starters, had to slow server down and let her know we wanted to start with apps before we decided on entree. Also first time ever getting a slice of cheesecake to go with no utensils or napkins! The restaurant is near several hotels and they must realize this is needed or at least offer. We made due finding our own at the hotel later - but clearly this was service lacking. Food was ok, not bad, would order the skinny shrimp and angel hair pasta again."
Holly M.,"Queen Creek, AZ",75,110,19,4.0,12/19/2015,Great meal with great service!!   We shared the philly cheese steak sandwich and the fettuccini Alfredo with chicken.  Both were scrumptious!!  I had the dirty martini with blue cheese stuffed olives and it rocked!!  . Our waitress was really pleasant.
L.J. S.,"Huntington Beach, CA",329,21,37,4.0,1/15/2016,I'm on Weight Watchers and going out is a pain but not too much when you go to the Cheesecake Factory.  Today I had the SkinnyLicious White Chicken Chili. Great flavor and it was warm and filling. 14 points for WW!
Chris M.,"Long Beach, CA",0,3,,1.0,8/27/2016,"I only go here because I have to(B day request ) . Come in the late afternoon and you will see how filthy this place is .My friend had to report the condition in the ladies room to the person up front.  Food and HAIR on the floor,,splatter on the wall ..  .. I lost my appetite . Salad was good ,sandwich was fair . Expensive for cafeteria flavor . Might want to invest in a vacuum for the floor and a cleaning service . I am surprised this place is still in business ."
Becky L.,"Long Beach, CA",646,91,156,1.0,10/11/2015,"Oh my word this place has gone down the tubes... I don't even know why it's busy!?!? After the experience today I was just annoyed as was my entire party. First- long wait- but if it would have been a good experience it would have been worth it. Second- service = substandard; the waitress messed up the order and the food took unbearably long. The only good thing was that my iced tea was near full most of the time. Ok so she messed up and my sons order didn't go in- fine, everyone makes mistakes, but don't then charge us for it!! Duh!!! Third- the staff's personal hygiene was not up to par. Gross. There should be higher standards in a big chain like this. The expediter had a very long beard, like a little less than a for long, he looked like a clean guy and I have nothing against facial hair, but it was not appetizing. Our waitress also had what looked like a small red sore on her nostril which was also unappetizing. Fourth- the window shade was insufficient and sun was in our eyes. Last, the food was hit or miss- it wasn't like it used to be. The salad quality, freshness and dressing was under par. Sad. If this was a cheap place with no wait I could see coming here from time to time, but there are so many better options at this price point with better food and less weight. The cheesecake was good and I do give credit for that!!"
Tom F.,"Fountain Valley, CA",17,54,,2.0,11/24/2015,"I have been coming here for years and usually it is consistently good. I love to go the Fashion Island this time of year and see the Christmas Tree. My youngest daughter, now 21, and I love Cheesecake factory and consider it a special time when we go. Last night we went to the check out the tree and have fried Zucchini and a salad.  We waited about 15 minutes for a table, no big deal. We were greeted by our hostess and gave her our order. She asked if we wanted bread. Yes we love the bread! About 5 minutes later our salad came out. No Zucchini, then 5 minutes later our waitress came out and said they were out of zucchini. Huh. So we ordered the loaded Tator Tots. 5 minutes later she came out and said they had taken those off the menu and no longer serve them. So we ordered Cheesy bread.  We finished the salad, still no bread. We finally got our bread and once we finished that we asked our waitress to package our cheesy bread to go. We left feeling very unsatisfied. Also the waitress saw our unhappiness over them being out of our favorites and did zero to try to remedy the situation."
Keila N.,"Beverly Hills, CA",5000,2051,11264,3.0,7/10/2012,"My daughter is a carnivore, and has discriminating taste for steak.  It was early Saturday.  We were on our way to San Diego when we stopped here.  The precision in which the service was delivered was down to corporate science. We ordered the rib eye, arugula salad and shrimp tacos.  The arugula salad was amazing.  I didn't care for the shrimp tacos, however.  It had an over-kill sweet overtone. We also had the cookie dough cheesecake as well as the Godiva cheesecake, the size of which were intended for small giants.  They were decadent and beautiful."
Mack M.,"Irvine, CA",26,25,33,1.0,10/23/2015,"We've been here before and had a good time, but today was nearly horrible. The only good part was how promptly the hostess greeted us. We waited at our table until I flagged a waiter down. Our waiter showed up later and continued to provide unfriendly absentminded and incredibly slow service. They weren't very busy so it was purely his behavior not workload. Maybe he had an off day, but he ruined the start of our Friday evening. We won't be back."
Petina T.,"Irvine, CA",0,39,27,5.0,8/2/2014,"Standard family dinning location for those nights that we completely run out of food at home. Fried Calamari (X2) - make sure to order that extra order because one is simply NOT enough Herb Crusted Fillet of Salmon with extra lemon sauce - don't forget to order the extra lemon sauce to avoid wait time Pasta Da Vinci - Fresh mushroom with sauce Pasta Carbonara - yup, nice and creamy and waiting for a heart attack Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic - kids can't get enough of it Shrimp with Angel Hair - HUMONGOUS shrimp with aldente angel hair pasta which is hard to do Cajun Jambalaya Pasta - a bit too spicy for some but others love it! Their staff is general attentive, however, this may vary depending on the day of the week. For the price is fair considering  the portion provided."
John C.,"Newport Beach, CA",11,209,5,4.0,12/23/2015,"Pros: The location at Fashion Island is great. The service attentive. The portions huge. Food quality very good for the price.  Menu very extensive. Desserts great but who has enough room for it after the huge meal?  Cons: Wait time over 30 minutes.  We found the place very clean during our visit.  By the way, when we asked our grandchildren regarding their choice of dining, this was it."
John N.,"Austin, TX",349,486,182,4.0,3/4/2013,"There are plenty of reasons Cheesecake Factory is not my first choice of dining BUT BUT BUT......but it is an ideal restaurant for the indecisive as well as the pricing for the portions that they do offer. I have been going for almost ten years now.  Before the skiny menu was offered, I left the restaurant due to how unhealthy their meals were, but they tasted delicious. My most recent visit to the Cheesecake Factory reminded me of the service, always friendly and offering many different selections.  I recommend aiming for any of their seafood dishes where extra attention is given to the presentation as well as choice of sauce to compliment the food.  Their seasonal swordfish is nothing short of amazing! TIP:  ONLY go for their signature cheesecake desserts if you are either planning on taking it home OR you ate a small meal and you KNOW you have room in your tummy for more.  Otherwise you will hurt yourself.  Too much food, not a happy foodie."
Kev O.,"Irvine, CA",32,389,860,3.0,12/11/2012,"Before this Cheesecake Factory, I'd only tried the ones in San Francisco, San Jose, and Houston. Decor is pretty much the same theme as the other outlets, but this CF is much smaller in size. Service was very friendly and fortunately the place wasn't too crowded.  I ordered the Lentil Soup and Turkey Sandwich lunch special. It was ok. The lentil soup was thick and hearty and really hit the spot. However, the turkey sandwich was a bit of a let down. I expected a whole lot more turkey in my sandwich, but it came with a very modest portion which seemed rather uncharacteristic of the usual CF portions. There seemed to be a shortage of staff attending to all the tables as I could see my waitress running from table to table taking orders and serving food. As such, it took me several minutes to catch her attention so that I could ask for the check. I've always liked the CF and will continue to frequent it, but I likely won't order the turkey sandwich again."
Alex V.,"Murrieta, CA",125,7,,1.0,12/3/2015,"Worst service I may have ever had at a restaurant. Was told by the server that I made a mistake while ordering which messed up the order, and the attitudes of both the server and the food runner were rude and simply unfriendly. Probably could not be paid to come to this place again."
Winston S.,"Hermosa Beach, CA",93,447,89,3.0,8/15/2012,"Went here after Sawdust Festival in Laguna and hanging out at Heisler Park with Jessica.  She hadn't heard of Cheesecake Factory, and was craving cheesecake.   We we quoted a 15-20 min wait, but our table was ready in 5-10 min, which was nice.  Our server happened to be Jessica too.  She was fairly attentive and helpful. We both ordered pizzas, I had the spicy meat pizza and Jess had the goat cheese and veggie pizza.  Both tasted good, but I got a bad stomach ache that night. Jess had the red velvet cheesecake, which lacked much flavor.  I had the Reese's Peanut Putter Cup cheesecake, which was so-so.  I guess not all of the cheesecakes are as good as I thought. All in all, it was good.  The server, Jessica is good.  On the other hand, my date, Jessica will not hear from me again, lmao!  Too high maintenance and too many issues."
