Craig Z.,"San Diego, CA",307,7,,1.0,6/20/2016,"Was there yesterday for some appetizers before seeing a movie as part of celebrating Father's Day. Sat in the bar area as it was open. I knew the place was busy and we were in a rush so we asked the bartender who was also our server if we had enough time to order. She said we did. She was a blonde woman working around 1:30 pm yesterday. Turns out that we didn't. We asked the bartender/server about the status of our order and all we got is attitude and a snotty response about it being Father's Day. Since we asked about the wait time, she should have answered us honestly in the beginning and not had attitude when her failure to do things became an issue. Food came when we needed to leave and we have her a credit card to pay for it. We watched her check every table before running the card and check a few more tables on her way back. She wanted to make us later than we were. She even commented to a couple of other servers than we had a movie to catch as to justify her actions. I wish I name to put it here but crappy attitude from the bar staff makes me choosing other places in the future."
Karl S.,"Las Vegas, NV",144,514,1017,5.0,6/20/2015,"This review is for take out only. We were getting into OC late, wanted dinner to take to the hotel other than room service, so called in an order to a nearby Cheesecake. The restaurant is in a great location and easy parking. The staff at the pick up location, the bakery, were beyond helpful and cheerful. I got the Kobe burger and it was very tasty and well made. Wifey had the Shepherds Pie and loved that as well. Based on how friendly everyone was, I'm looking forward to having a dinner here."
Anne T.,"Irvine, CA",0,6,,1.0,11/14/2015,"Yelp information is incorrect: Newport Beach location does not take reservations, according to ""Steven"" on 11/14/15. No stars deserved, but unable to post without one."
Michelle T.,"Costa Mesa, CA",779,999,1108,4.0,4/7/2015,"Over the years,  I've grown pretty tired of cheesecake factory.  But if I do go to one,  this one has a pretty nice view. Easy access in fashion Island. Never had to wait too long for a table.  There are some areas where you can catch a glimpse of the ocean.  Service is on par with the other locations. Plus one star for the location and views."
Samantha W.,"Pico-Robertson, Los Angeles, CA",92,23,11,5.0,6/2/2015,"Always love coming to cheesecake during happy hour. Their avocado eggrolls are the best, it's my favorite compared to BJs, CPK, and other random restaurants I can't think of right now. Cheesecake is a little on the pricey side so happy hour def gives you the best bang for your buck. Drinks are a sweet deal too!"
Maha R.,"Laguna Beach, CA",26,18,3,5.0,12/10/2015,It's very convenient so We love going there as its also kid friendly!!  The only salmon my son will eat! I think it's called  Thai style:-)  Hours are good and yes they are busy and yes there might be a wait but easy to kill time around fashion island :-)
Guilherme B.,"Costa Mesa, CA",6,4,,4.0,5/24/2014,"Really good food.  Great waiters, very helpful. Sometimes there are a long wait to seat."
Craig H.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",15,87,3,4.0,12/8/2015,This is the same restaurant your used to with great meals and a HUGE menu.  This location also has a bit of a view!
cheryl w.,"Las Vegas, NV",27,58,51,4.0,5/6/2014,"3 stars because food is always good and our waiter Matthew was AWESOME!! The stars go to Matthew!! The hostess on the other hand..... Horrible customer service... Young and rude!  Should listen when someone complains about the condition of the restrooms... As a hostess, it's good to have experience with people skills... NEXT!!"
A A.,"Westchester / LAX, Los Angeles, CA",5,14,2,2.0,2/3/2014,The food was good Service was so so  Place was under construction All an all 2 star The place need a better Managment all together These issues should be solved very easy
Christine O.,"Orange County, CA",2,28,12,4.0,3/31/2015,"We went for for a co workers birthday after work. It was crowded but we were seated rather quickly. We started with a cocktail and skipped the appetizers to save room for the meal. 1 of the girls got Steak Medallions with vegetables from the light and fit menu, 1got a Veggie Burger, 2 had the Steak Diane and I had the Chicken Madera. The food was presented really well and it came out nice and hot. The only complaint on the Steak Diane from both girls is that it had a very thin gravy to it and it had a very strong distinct flavor of red wine vinegar so whether they use balsamic vinegar glaze as a finish I'm not sure but a very strong distinct red wine vinegar flavor came through. Because the gravy was thin it didn't stick to the steak. They both said that it was very dry but they didn't want to hassle sending it back. After they pointed it out to me I realized I had the same thin consistency of gravy on my Madera. Most of the time the gravy is nice and thick but that wasn't the case this night. The bread was good and the girls liked the wheat one the best but the white bread was very hard and was not warm at all which made it seem kind of stale. Tyson was an attentive server considering that he had a lot of tables to take care of. We had a Lemon Meringue cheesecake for dessert...Wow! I think that was the best part of the meal and I never do dessert so that says a lot! Overall, 4 stars as my meal was very good but the next day the girls brought it up again how the vinegar threw off their dinner and the steak was really dry. We had not been to Cheesecake Factory in quite a while as Yard House still seems to be everybody's favorite but I think Cheesecake's  food is good enough to give them another try. We'll see!"
Amanda W.,"San Francisco, CA",2,25,,2.0,7/26/2015,"Food was nothing special, and the service was horrifying. Our waitress forgot the chicken in our pasta, which was okay because she had the manager comped the dish. But then they forgot the chocolate cake!!!! Unacceptable."
Karen B.,"Newport Beach, CA",530,549,62,4.0,10/12/2013,"Hard not to like Cheesecake Factory, look at the menu! I can not think of anything I have ever had here where I was disappointed. We came here last night around 5:30 and was seated promptly. The front desk hostess had a huge smile on her face and the girl who seated us (I think her name was Laurie?) was so full of personality and humor. She was great. We liked the bread, I had a really good caesar salad with chicken and my boyfriend had the sheepherder pie. Of course we ordered a cheesecake with strawberries to go. I kept drooling watching 2 girls at another table eating a piece and thought this is what it is all about!! We had a terrific waiter and when the sun started to set they opened the window covering and the view was breathtaking. The dining is upstairs and you can take the stairs or the elevator. Well worth it."
Jason H.,"Corona del Mar, CA",13,20,12,2.0,1/6/2014,"Great service but the food was mediocre at best. The menu has advertisements in it which is incredibly tacky and obnoxious.  Although the location and everything is nice,it's your typical bland corporate establishment."
Marie V.,"Long Beach, CA",42,136,26,4.0,3/30/2015,"Now that I have the information from corporate about what's vegan, I always have a great experience here! The wait can be a little long, but it's worth it. The servers are almost always very friendly and attentive."
Briset F.,"Irvine, CA",11,10,2,4.0,3/13/2015,Always a great experience! My boyfriend and I love the cheesecake especially the reese's one. I recently went in for weekend brunch and loved it! They had a great selection of breakfast items and I loved the French toast!
Angie D.,"Apple Valley, CA",36,37,5,1.0,11/15/2014,"We normally wouldn't eat here while away from home but we were craving Buffalo Blasts.  We were sat and didn't see our waiter Jeremy (server #166) for 10 minutes. Then he stopped by dropped off some bread, took our drink order then asked if we wanted bread and said he would go get us some...what?! He disappeared for 20 minutes. We considered leaving at this point and should have as the service only got worse. He FINALLY brought us our drinks and then said he had to come back to get our order. We ordered the Buffalo Blasts and opted to share an entree so we could have room for dessert. After dinner we were able to track our waiter down and order the warm apple crisp served with vanilla ice cream. We sat there & our waiter kept offering excuses as to why it was taking so long. Yet he never went to check. I saw our dessert sitting & melting for no less than 10 minutes. He came by our table & said I am going to check what is taking so long. He finally for the first time went up to where the desserts come out and brought us the soupy, cold apple soggy dessert. Of course we refused it and told him to bring us our check. Our total time there for a single appetizer, one entree & a dessert we couldn't eat, 1 hour & 40 minutes!!!!! RIDICULOUS, this guy was horrible.  I am calling management today as I was too livid to discuss our experience rationally last night."
Dan F.,"Trabuco Canyon, CA",0,50,1,2.0,11/30/2014,Terrible bartenders.  Just talked to each other and were totally distracted by the football game.  We were there maybe 3 hours and they never engaged with us or asked how we were doing.  The whole bar staff just talked to each other.  No connection to the patrons.
Patrick N.,"Philadelphia, PA",155,433,533,4.0,3/10/2012,"I am really happy that I FINALLY found something really good at the Cheesecake Factory. Normally, I like the food, but nothing is really that good. MAN, WAS I WRONG The Shrimp and Chicken Gumbo is terrific. It is sooo good, especially when you dip bread in the broth.  This location is probably my favorite, there's lots of natural light and even some ocean views."
