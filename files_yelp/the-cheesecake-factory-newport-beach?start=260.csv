Mildrid M.,"Tustin, CA",1,1,,2.0,4/27/2016,"I was disappointed at this Cheesecake Factory for their service. they didn't communicate well about our table since we were a big party. however, the food was good and one of their host was really friendly."
Hannah Y.,"Cerritos, CA",12,15,1,1.0,8/6/2013,"Came in for happy hour thinking it was 4-7 at 6:05 and the girl in the front, Katie, gave me and my friends attitude telling us we couldn't go in-- which was fine-- but it threw us off.....  We stepped outside and decided we wanted dinner from Cheesecake Factory anyways We came back in and saw katie flirting with her co-worker all smiling.. but when we walking up to the desk She gave us such a dirty look, her whole face expression changed and she gave us attitude. I felt very discriminated against and my friends and I will NEVER come back here again. Cheesecake Factory usually has great customer service.. And our waiter was great but the girl in the front just ruined our day I hope Katie learns a lesson and gets fired."
Ron A.,"Irvine, CA",3,25,,5.0,12/3/2013,"CONSISTENCY! Great food, great service, great location! My wife and I have been coming here ever since our first dates. We love the little patio overlooking the ocean, especially around sunset. Not a lot of people know about this little patio as it is tucked away behind the elevator and bar. There are only two small cocktail tables as it is a very small and private patio. We called it the ""VIP"" section. Our regular: BBQ Chicken Pizza with a basket of fries. Don't forget the delicious, garlic ranch!"
Amber H.,"Agoura Hills, CA",234,97,49,5.0,10/23/2014,"Newport Beach is just as good as Mission Viejo...I ordered the shrimp tacos off of their skinny menu and there was nothing skinny about it! Perfect portion size...tons of flavor...and it came with this little salad with it that was absolutely amazing. As always, very nice decor...great service...everything you would expect in a cheesecake factory and more. Definitely worth the visit."
Lisa A.,"Westlake Village, CA",139,77,5,2.0,9/26/2013,"This place is often hit or miss. Stopped by tonight for a healthy meal. Ordered the grilled salmon with veggies and an ice tea. Food was okay, as the salmon wasn't as fresh as I would of liked. Also veggies should have been grilled, instead of now they cooked it. On a positive note the ice tea was good and the waiter was great.  I wish this place would step up their game."
Kristina M.,"Newport Beach, CA",16,26,17,4.0,12/13/2014,"The best kale and quinoa salad I've ever eaten.  Has grapes, parmasean, sunflower seeds,  sweet red pepper and lemon vinegarette."
Chris M.,"Long Beach, CA",0,17,,2.0,1/11/2015,"The place was packed as always . I have eaten here over the years and every time I eat here , the portions and bread keep getting smaller . The bread its 1/2 the size it was years ago! I ordered steak and shrimp combo . I got 3 small pieces of breakfast quality steak you would find at Norm's and 3 medium shrimp , and lots of mashed potatoes . This is not a good meal value . I left hungry  with maybe 4 oz. of food -not including the potatoes . For 20 bucks you can get 2 meals at Norms and be full..  The sauces were good .The cheese cake great as usual -but 8 dollars for one piece!!!! Good place to come if you have lots of cash and are not hungry and like mashed potatoes and really over priced cheesecake ."
Ruth H.,"Mountain View, CA",146,98,79,3.0,4/12/2012,"I grew up in the midwest so didn't encounter my first Cheesecake factory till a trip to Chicago. I thought it was so amazing and fancy in high school, but since then it feels more like a classier version Applebee's with the chain feel. The food is fairly average, with portions that are huge and very heavy stuff in general. The cheesecake menu is very extensive so share! In general, good for larger groups because they're well able to handle it. Personal faves are: -Honey Wheat appetizer bread -Thai Lettuce Wraps -Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic -Lemoncello Cream Torte"
James C.,"Tustin, CA",26,69,44,4.0,3/8/2015,"Service here is fairly quick. Food here is always above standard as well. Crowds are usually dense on Sunday's and Saturdays, but still rather fast paced getting order to your table.  The great thing about this location is that it is close to the beach and has a nice view of it too. They have a wide range of culinary picks and cater to both the very famished to the dainty nibbler. Clean environment on top of it is superb, surprisingly with the traffic that comes in and out of there. Servers have a great wannabe-there drive."
Sarah K.,"Newport Beach, CA",210,39,11,3.0,7/13/2015,Brandy serviced my girlfriend and I today for lunch. We got blueberry mojitos which were bomb. Fast service. Brandy was awesome. Pasta was a little soupy but life goes on lol. Overall good service and great drinks. Loss at a couple stars for the pasta.
Walter H.,"Anaheim, CA",0,2,9,1.0,9/29/2014,"I've always had great service at Cheesecake Factory, what happened? Had to send my wife's dinner back twice since it was cold, we finally just canceled it. We noticed that others around us got their food well before us and we were seated before them, what a disappointment, will not return here."
Cassidy J.,"Orange, CA",161,327,573,3.0,2/8/2015,"Cheesecake Factory is always pretty darn good.. This location is decent. It is really dark, we literally had to use s flashlight. It was also a frozen tundra. Most the time I go for the free bread.. But the food is good too!"
Pamela S.,"Highland Park, IL",2,121,,1.0,7/26/2016,"Stopped in here for late lunch/early dinner.  I was dining alone so they gave me a table at the end of a row and right next to a rather tall partition.  My wait person (on the receipt it said her name was Mana), would stand on the other side of this partition and talk to me over the partition.  At first I didn't even know she was talking to me--it seemed like such an odd way to interact with someone.  From my seat I would look up and just see the head over the other side of the partition.  I placed my order and waited such a long time for the food that two people were seated next to me maybe 10 minutes later, they ordered, they received their food, and were half way through their meal and I still had not received my salad.  When I was able to find my waitperson she said it was taking a long time because of my salad, which made no sense.  Finally the salad came.  Then maybe 20 minutes later (or longer) my entree showed up.  It took a long time to get the check--I had to find someone to bring it to me as Mana never stopped by to ask how everything was.  I had also ordered something earlier to take back to the hotel, and it was not brought to me with the check--it was a cold item so it could have been made anytime.  I waited 15 more minutes and it still hadn't come so I got up to leave--I was just going to leave without it as it was all taking so long and it was hot and stuffy in there--I just wanted to get out.  As I was walking out the to go order appeared.  Later that evening when I opened it in the hotel, it was just slop--shrimp rolls not wrapped well so it was a pile of stuff with the rice wraps sort of in a pile--I should have posted the photo.  I think this location is a bad example of this chain.  The service was poor and the waitperson unattentive and not the least bit interested in serving customers."
Jamie P.,"Lakewood, CA",0,6,,1.0,8/20/2014,Worst place that i visited in my whole life... 1. Terrible services (Front desk and servers)  2. Terrible cleanliness I went to the most terrible restaurant ever. I will not go there... seriously... I do not recommend to go there.
John F.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",51,31,8,5.0,4/5/2015,"Our waitress, Maureen, was the best I have ever had. It was my birthday/Easter brunch and she made it such a delightful experience. We will definitely be back the food and service was flawless. Thank you Maureen!"
John L.,"Newport Beach, CA",26,109,253,3.0,5/26/2013,"What happened to the beloved Newport Beach Factory? We used to come here weekly in the mid-aughts, but hadn't been in since maybe 2009 or so. This is still the nicest location with the ocean views and all, but what the H, people?   We still like the Factory and will be back for the basics, but I hope that they can get everything back together now that people seem to be a bit more optimistic lately. Pasta dishes seemed pre-sauced and set-up as if they sat at pass too long.   Given breadth of menu and apparently lower turnover numbers, wonder if less popular protein and pasta dishes are frozen and reheated. 8 pm Friday should be a pretty busy daypart with good turnover to prevent this from happening.. So, take-home message is stay with the entree salads and burgers.  Get dessert. Staff was still great and very helpful, but as we have seen the last few years with so many other places, maybe economics is squeezing quality a bit in favor of preserving portion size."
M M.,"Newport Beach, CA",0,2,,5.0,9/26/2014,"A group of us go quite often for a Happy Hour during the week.  The Cheesecake Factory at Fashion Island is a new favorite.  Interesting...as long as you're seated before 6:00pm (in the bar area) you receive the Happy Hour special pricing.  Such a Deal!!!  The Happy Hour burger is dynamite, and NOT to be missed!  And fries for only $1 extra...Are you KIDDING me??  How great is that? Tonight was special.  We had the BEST waiter.  He was surprisingly humorous, very patient and on top of every aspect of his duties.  He went above & beyond.  All of us were impressed; so much so that we asked him for his name.  BRIAN RICHARDSON.   Thanks, Brian!"
Vicci H.,"Newport Beach, CA",0,12,1,3.0,4/18/2015,"I've always lived the CCF but This past Thursday I dropped in after shopping to have their tuna tartare!  8 hrs later I was sick as a dog! I was just diagnosed with food poisoning!  Not to mention what the infected did to my body , I was unable to go on our long awaited trip to the desert!  I'm feeling bummed !"
Thanh L.,"Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA",0,33,5,3.0,2/22/2015,"I value The Cheesecake Factory for their consistency in service and food.  However I was disappointed in the latter today at this location.  The servers are very nice and attentive but the food was not what I expected from this chain.  It was flavorless.  I had the shepards pie and its as if no effort went into seasoning it.. It tasted like cheese on top of insta-taters on top of a burger.  How do you get gravy wrong?  It tasted like nothing.  Gravy is flour cooked in fat, thats about it, if only the bare minimum was done it would taste better than it did today."
rowena h.,"Irvine, CA",3,14,3,1.0,6/29/2014,"My family and I went for a Sunday lunch at this Fashion Island branch. When we came in, it was empty and my daughter approached the hostess. The hostess ask for her name and took it down for party of 4. We waited and we saw people coming in and were seated right away. After a few groups passed and 15 minutes of waiting, my daughter approached the hostess and asked how long more is the wait. The hostess asked for her name and told her that her name got lost. She sat us then and never even apologized. My daughter felt she was rascist the way she was looking at us. Attention: Asian people, don't eat here so you don't go through what we went through."
