Sam R.,"Temecula, CA",214,360,54,4.0,8/5/2014,"The Cheesecake Factory is always a safe bet when I take my wife out for dinner. The food is great and the servers are usually terrific. They do a great job of rotating menu options and holding on to our favorites. This last visit got off to a rocky start with hostess, but luckily the everything after dealing them was great."
Richard H.,"Cerritos, CA",0,9,,3.0,10/19/2014,"2.5 hr wait seriously. It wasn't even that busy in the place the whole time. Anyway food was ok. Had a good portion for the price, but drinks where way over priced for what you got. Not enough alcohol for the price.  $25 bucks for 2 drinks and they were weak very week. Anyway hole experience was ok, wait still was very long."
Jen T.,"Orange County, CA",417,333,1909,4.0,12/14/2010,"I dont like to write reviews on big chain restaurants, but this is going into my ""turkey burger"" list. I might as well write a fatty review because once upon a time, cheesecake factory was my all time favorite restaurant. :) **WARNING: This review will probably be longer than the 7th Harry Potter book. So my favorite pasta and cheesecake happens to have the highest calories in their respective categories. OH WELL! hahaha.  Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic Cream Sauce ! The flavoring, ingredients, sauce, chicken is great! I have tried this dish at the Irvine, Huntington Beach, Brea, Sacramento locations and they all taste the same..usually. Although, the one here always makes it with less sauce. I should really learn how to make this..save me 16 bucks! Presentation is always so pretty!  Red Velvet Cheesecake Hello darling, I love you! I try to have this cheesecake rarely..but its so delicious!  Before the creation of the red velvet cheesecake, my favorite was the tiramisu! Still amazing! All their cheesecakes are really good though, depends on what you are in the mood for. The rest are all the dishes Ive tried over the years.. -complementary bread: dive right in for the dark, brown bread with oat flakes on it! Its heavenly with some butter. -Avocado egg rolls: yummy!  - crab and artichoke dip served with sourdough bread:hated it! It was overwhelming and heart clogging. spinach and cheese dip: ehhh... -stuff chicken tortillas..its a lot on one plate. It is served with corn cakes..and is not comparable to El Torito's corn cakes. -factory burrito grande: muy grande! delicioso! -four cheese pasta: too cheesy..felt kind of sick after 2 bites. -Pasta da Vinci: Loved it! Different, but good. -Cajun Jambalaya Pasta: not a fan. everyone seems to love this dish, so it just me. -Evelyn's Favorite Pasta: Bro and I hated it. Never eating this again. -Kobe Burger: not too shabby for Jen! -Grilled Chicken tostada salad: MASSIVE..couldnt see my mom's face for a bit. It was okay. And..the moment you have been waiting for... -Green Chile style Turkey burger: SOOO GOOD!! Very tasty! Turkey patty was grilled nicely! Their regular grilled turkey burger sounds amazing because it has everything that I love!  I dont know how J.K. Rowling wrote so many books, but this review tired me out!  Enjoy! :)"
Nick R.,"Austin, TX",8,54,12,5.0,9/10/2011,"Usually there is nothing to add to Cheesecake Factory. Great food, fair pricing and you should expect some time to be seated as it is busy as in every factory. Everything was just as expected. Fast seating, first bread basket within 5 minutes, food severed in time, friendly staff. You should really try the ""Orange chicken"" and for sure the ""Ultimate Red Velvet Cheesecake"" if this is your first stop at the Cheesecake Factory. It was really busy today but the noise was ok and we always had a waiter close to us. Highly recommend this location, great atmosphere and nice folk around you. Short, simple, honest review ;)"
Jeanne P.,"Pasadena, CA",0,7,1,1.0,9/15/2014,"Our family have been coming back here throughout the years despited the questionable service.  Our last straw were when we ordered the spaghetti w/meatball for the kids.  They (3 and 6yo) ate 1/2, the rest we took home.  The next day I pulled it out to warm up, cut the meatball in half and discovered that the inside were still red.  The meat on two remaining meatball were raw.  Just unacceptable! !  I will provide a pic up there to prove my point.  Luckily,  neither one got sick."
Sheena W.,"Orange County, CA",98,244,81,3.0,9/30/2013,I had a glass if white wine and cheesecake. I asked the server which one he liked and went with that. It did not disappoint! ( white chocolate macadamia nuts with caramel )  Service was great even though we came in late. Large location.
Mike M.,"Huntington Beach, CA",1821,1380,381,4.0,11/28/2010,"Yes it's a chain restaurant.  Yes it's in a mall.  Yes, we had a good meal and a good time.  We were looking for a spot after pictures with Santa. Short wait at 6pm on Sunday.  The waiter was fantastic.  The menu is enormous, as are the portions.  White cheddar and broccoli soup was delicious.  Seared ahi salad was big, fresh and tasty.  The kids loved their orange chicken.  Wifey dug the Jack Daniels Berry martini along with her pear and walnut salad. Peppermint bark cheesecake and chocolate coconut cheesecake were, as always, wonderful. A good time at a good place."
Dorothy L.,"Los Angeles, CA",849,422,753,4.0,10/7/2010,"Cheesecake Factories are pretty standard, but the unique characteristic of this one is the view. The restaurant is located on the second floor of the Fashion Island Shopping Center, and you should definitely request a window table, to best be able to enjoy the oh-so-beautiful Newport day.  We ordered an old-fashioned hamburger with sweet potato fries, the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta, and the BBQ Ranch salad.  The hamburger was pretty good, and the bun was delicious (almost like toasted garlic bread-y). The fries were disappointing to a SPF lover.  We ordered the pasta because we saw it featured on some food show and it looked amazing. It was pretty damn good. Too bad they don't have a lunch portion though.  The BBQ Ranch salad was gigantic and tasty, with about a hundred different ingredients, and hardly even ""good for you"". :)  CF is pretty expensive for what it is, but a good place to have a nice lunch every once in a while. I'd come back, but next time save a sliver of space in my belly for a niiiiice piece of cheesecake. Yum...  (Oh! I almost forgot... The bathrooms in this CF location were SO WEIRD - and not the good kind of weird. The floor, walls, and toilet are all black, and the bathroom is very dimly lit... Those two factors do not work well together. Needless to say, it was less than ""up to par"" in the cleanliness department. Hope you know how to pee in the dark!)"
Alissa Y.,"Huntington Beach, CA",24,110,421,4.0,9/6/2014,"Good service, great ocean views if you are by a window.  Usually the menu is too large that it becomes overwhelming.  I recently discovered the skinny menu which offers lighter meals and it also helps narrow down the choices of what to order.  I highly recommend the steak medallions off the skinny menu."
Heunji C.,"Las Vegas, NV",92,59,24,4.0,9/2/2013,"Can't go wrong with a caesar salad and the shrimp scampi! so delicious and satisfying! It ended up being $35, not too bad for quality food. Will come again, maybe not in the same plaza (too big of a mall)!"
Bella S.,"Santa Ana, CA",0,2,,5.0,3/1/2015,The menu has good verity of gluten free foods. The service is good and staff are friendly. The food is always fresh.
Ron X.,"Corona Del Mar, CA",1,19,,5.0,12/15/2015,"The family and I were here recently for dinner and had exceptional service from not only our server but the General Manager as well. One order in the party involved a steak which was slightly over-cooked and took a bit longer than expected. The GM came out and advised that they were working on it and will bring it out ASAP. When it came, is was just slightly over-cooked and for the most part, wasn't bad. The GM came and asked how things were and we said the steak was just slightly over-cooked but it was OK. No - he said, he took it back and wanted to make it right. Granted this took some more time but the 2nd steak came back perfect. At the end of the meal, the GM came back to apologize again for the steak and said it would not be on the bill and to make it up for everyone, we each can choose any dessert we wanted and it would be on the house. Having eaten at many restaurants across the entire spectrum, this was exceptional, over the top, customer service. The food was excellent as usual but this level of service deserves my FIVE STARS!"
Roland H.,"Dana Point, CA",29,60,10,4.0,8/31/2014,"I never liked cheesecake until I had cheesecake at the Cheesecake Factory. Unbelievable!!!! No reservations excepted, but it's a big place and the wait isn't too long usually. Food is very consistent and the wait staff are very pleasant. Try the herb crusted salmon..."
Ashley S.,"Los Angeles, CA",79,156,32,2.0,5/9/2014,"I love The Cheesecake Factory. However, this was the worst experience I had at Cheesecake Factory. I give it 2 stars because I have eaten here before and not had a problem. We called during the week to see if we could get a reservation on a Saturday evening and gave them the date and time. They said they did not take reservations, but they would keep it in mind and we could call that morning. We called that morning to make call ahead seating for a large group and showed up over an hour early to put our name in. We waited for over 2 hours, an hour of that was after our ""reservation.""  The hosteses would not give us a time and were not very nice. I don't mind waiting, especially when it's a large party, but we were not told it would be 2 hours. We were seated after all 15 of us decided to wait inside. They seated us almost immediately after that.  The service was good for the most part. They had multiple servers at our table, which got confusing. They could only split the checks a couple of ways, so we asked them if they could split it in half in a specific way since we had multiple groups within the group and they split it in a completely different way. We are a very easygoing group so I was a little confused as to all the frustration with our group. Overall, they could have had better communication skills. The food was good, for the most part. There were a couple of people that wished they had ordered something else, but other than that the food was good. The cheesecake was the best part of the meal, though.  I will probably eat here again, but not with a group. Any group over 4 seems like it could possibly be an inconvenience. I will pick another restaurant at Fashion Island next time. We got a call a week later asking us where our group was for our reservation. We called two or three times to confirm it for the previous Saturday. But we thought they didn't take reservations. At least, that's what we were told after waiting 2 hours..."
Allyson M.,"Seattle, WA",189,669,394,4.0,12/24/2010,"My bf's friend from the suburbs of Hell A made their way down south to Le OC and figured Cheesecake Factory at Fashion Island was the place to have dinner.  It was a Tuesday night, so we were seated right away. The interior is pretty elegant. There's a long walk to the hostess stand. Kinda makes you feel like a celebrity or something.  So thumbs up for decor. However, I did feel like I was in Newport. There were several Caucasian servers; however, we got the one non-Caucasian server. I'm sure they looked at our little group (2 Asians and 2 ambiguous) not dressed as nice=probably will not tip well, so let's give them our ""matching"" server. :(  The service was just OK. I was more interested in looking at the bar area. It just had like a '20s vibe, which fascinated me. I just wish I had dressed a little nicer. The jeans and flip flops and uncombed hair just made me feel like I didn't fit in. I could be wrong, though. LOL! I usually order some sort of pasta dish, but this time I ordered the white chicken chili (and no, it had nothing to do with being in Newport). It's the first time I had it, and it didn't disappoint! It was so yummy! There was a lot of chicken in it. There weren't too many beans, but it had a bit of a kick. It was gastacular! Toot toot!"
Tricia B.,"Newport Beach, CA",1,25,9,3.0,8/18/2014,"I ordered the bone in pork chop, I thought it would b a nice thick cut but I would say it was a little skimpy  for the ""bone-in"" portion that I'm used to. The service was so so but it's to b expected on the weekends from big chain restaurants."
Thomas C.,"Emeryville, CA",102,221,292,5.0,9/5/2010,"I had to write a review for one of the best burgers I've had in a really long time. Their Farmhouse Burger was amazing.  I'd like to consider myself a decent judge of burger.  It was simple, executed perfectly, and delicious. Toasted brioche bun, a nice juicy burger, the standards such as lettuce, tomato, mayo, and THEN, thick cuts of pork belly, NOT bacon, and topped with an egg sunny side up, sprinkled with some salt and pepper. It was seriously good.  I wouldn't normally write a review for a chain establishment, but this is seriously the best meal I've had at Cheesecake Factory.  And I've been coming to CF for YEARS! Bravo CF for a burger well done.  I will be back for more."
Domia H.,"Irvine, CA",32,51,28,5.0,9/22/2013,One of my favorite places to eat. They have a great selection! Ohh...and you must try the low carb cheesecake! Delicious!
Phoenix A.,"Seattle, WA",921,737,37,4.0,7/6/2010,"One of these stars alone is awarded for providing the fodder for playing Punch-Your-Friend-When-You-See-An-O.C.-Housewife. It's a good game to play when you are waiting 20 minutes for your buzzer to go off. Came here for a late lunch with a friend.  She had never had the avocado eggrolls, so I had to turn my vegetarian buddy on to these tasty bad boys.   I think every CF is the same interior-wise, dark wood and a lot of nothing really memorable.  But today, I had a view of the ocean sitting at what would have been a crappy deuce.  It seemed unreal, but I could see it. We sat in a section that had just gotten slammed, but our server was very communicative about what was going on.  My friend and I split everything down the middle, ordering the avo rolls, a caesar salad, and then the crisp apple streudel for dessert.  I love their warmed squaw bread, which is a really great treat since the wait is usually long.  So you can tear at the bread and smother it with butter like you've waited a lifetime for it.  The amazing, deep-fried invention of the avocado roll was pleasing as always.  Their caesars have always been a hit with me, but this time around the dessert is what sent me to the inevitable coma.   That sweet death was accompanied by a cup of freshly brewed coffee. It was the perfectly strong complement to the uber-caloric end. But thank goodness we did the splitsies with our courses, and actually the coffee was on our server who was ever so grateful that we were patient and non-attitude-in-ous with her. All that equaled to a super (mayber over-) satisfying lunch."
Barbra D.,"Santa Ana, CA",89,19,2,1.0,3/30/2014,"Love the Cheesecake Factory but surprisingly, they DO NOT have separate fryers for the seafood and non-seafood so if you are allergic to seafood then that's just too bad! I cannot believe that such a huge corporation will not install more equipment to accommodate people with seafood allergies! My favorite thing from here is the avocado egg rolls but I can't eat them because of this. I'm very disappointed and I can't believe that they at least don't think about possible lawsuits! Very disappointed."
