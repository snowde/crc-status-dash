Ryan D.,"Fountain Valley, CA",205,94,10,5.0,6/7/2013,"One of the best.  Love coming here to grab a burger. Their mushroom burger and Monterey burger are both amazing! The burger is cook to a perfect medium rare if you ask. Their buns are always toasted and overall the flavors are just great. (Cheesecake Factory and Lazy Dog make the best burgers) My girlfriend loves the Garlic Noodles as well. Very simple clean tasting dish. Also if you do not want to spend that much money and are not as hungry, they have a bunch of small plates that are very tasty."
Josh B.,"Irvine, CA",2440,229,367,5.0,2/22/2015,"Cheesecake Factory!!! The perfect place to go when you're hungry. They have sooooo many options of food to eat you will not know what to pack in fact if you're on decisive may be a bad decision because are so many options they do have amazing cakes by usually just end up with their entrées and the drinks are good to the pricing is a little high sometimes it's pretty mediocre but the food is always pretty good and I love the environment definitely recommend it, it's Way to go!"
Christine T.,"San Francisco, CA",820,803,1042,5.0,12/2/2010,Ahhh.. I wouldn't write a review here BUT the red velvet cheesecake is to DIE for!!!!! OMG my two favorite things in the world combined!!! Cheesecake and red velvet... Too bad it's 1500 calories!!!! But..... So worth it.  Surprisingly the weight management grilled chicken is pretty good too and only 590 calories :)
Anamarie T.,"Mission Viejo, CA",32,109,26,5.0,10/8/2013,"The menu is very diverse.  From Asian to Mexican and american food.  A couple of my favorites are the Miso Salmon, White Chicken Chili, Shrimp Platter, and the Firecracker Salmon.  We tried the new Rocky Road Sundae and as most of the desserts there it was amazing.  The Cheesecake is what they are known for.. always a MUST.  Eat dessert fist!  The entrees are large and very filling.  Some of my favorite cheesecakes are: Caramel Apple Strusal, Oreo, Adams Peanut butter chocolate, and just the plain cheesecake with some cherries!"
PatrickJ T.,"Bakersfield, CA",193,2912,14296,4.0,3/5/2013,"I like Cheesecake Factory.  On this trip, we bought a couple of beverages, Jambalaya, Grilled Cheese sandwich, brownie sundae, and the Chocolate Pecan Turtle cheesecake.  Costed about $42.  Not too bad. My wife and I enjoy coming to this particular Cheesecake Factory.  Newport Beach holds a special place in our hearts.  This location is located at Fashion Island which is an awesome mall to visit and shop at.  Plus you are in Newport Beach!  What's not to like in this town? Personally, the Cheesecake Factory is my favorite chain restaurant!!  Their cheesecakes are superb!!  It is on my bucket list to try every single one they make!  So far, I've tried about 2 dozen flavors over the years.  Just wish they didn't cost so much though.  $7 for a slice of cheesecake is pretty steep!"
Bret W.,"Los Feliz, CA",199,58,,4.0,4/16/2014,"Okay, the Cheesecake Factory is well, the Cheesecake Factory.  Yeah, here's the deal: I'm like a total glutton here... then I have to go home and do my Suzanne Sommers Thigh Master and work out to 40-year old DVD's of Richard Simmons.  OMG... It's a nightmare!!  Just kiddin' Somehow, I'm still very slim and I love the Cheese Cake Factory. I know it's a corporate chain... blah, blah' blah. But try telling me that when I put a fork in my rasberry-lemon cheesecake.  It's like I can't even hear you... I'm too busy looking at the decadent menu, looking for my next slice of cheesecake.  Hold on, I can't talk now... I think I just heard my arteries calling me."
Mary S.,"Los Angeles, CA",23,29,2,1.0,10/15/2012,"I must start by saying that the Cheesecakes and jambalaya, as well as the chicken and biscuits that I've had here are great.  This review is about the poorest service that I've ever received at a CCF in all of my days; and by all of my days I mean at least ten years.  My fiancée and I were starting to give up on chain restaurants because it seems as though they are really not giving two shizzes about their customers, but we had faith in the classic Factory. So we decided to go here one day for a late Sunday lunch, around 2 or so. It was unusually crowded for a Sunday at this time, so we waited about 40 minutes. Once we were finally seated, it took our dim witted server about ten minutes to come ask for our drink orders. Keep in mind, he was serving the table immediately next to us. Once he came to see us, he asked for our drinks and if we wanted bread (of course we do!). About ten minutes later he comes with our drinks and said that he forgot if we wanted bread or not. ""Yes please,"" I answered. Another few minutes go by and we finally get our bread, and order our food. I kid you not, we ordered a Chinese Chicken Salad and a taco plate.  FOURTT FIVE MINUTES LATER I have to remind him that we ordered a salad and tacos, and asked where they were. He said that someone should have brought it out already, and looked at us like it was our fault that no one brought us our food. First of all, its YOUR job to make sure that YOUR tables have been taken care of, not somebody else's. Second of all, WTF dude? I can't go make the food myself here, that's why I came and am paying you to do it. I'm tired. It's Sunday. totally unacceptable.  I have concluded that this kid is just totally unprepared and too incompetent to be a server on a Sunday lunch shift, possibly any shift at all, and if the management at this establishment doesn't figure that out soon, they will no longer have us, or any other paying patrons as customers."
Donald S.,"Newport Beach, CA",590,448,25,3.0,3/22/2012,"Ya gotta eat somewhere, right!?!? This was my ""somewhere"" a few weeks ago...I'm almost fully recovered now. I'm just kidding around (as far as you know), I probably didn't have any real problems with the food at the Fashion Island Factory. That's largely because I didn't order much of anything...between all the kids scampering around the joint, the super loud and hyper after work conversations fueled by too many mediocre cocktails and the strangely disconcerting 44 chapter book that they laughingly call the ""menu"", I pretty much didn't have an appetite. I know...crazy! We met several members of The Beautiful Carin's family, who happened to drop by scenic Newport Beach to help her celebrate her birthday! It was an interesting dinner, right from the outset. The waiter kept pressing our group to order...""I'll give you few more minutes"" as if it were an imperative that we be ready to spout our requests the moment he reappeared. In his 8 - 10 return visits to our table, we weren't ever ready. Honestly though, we are the customers...Simmer down Jethro...we'll order when we're damn good and ready...I know your CF waiters handbook says to move us along in order to ""optimize"" the table...but we are catching up with family and this is going to take a little time. Jethro finally resorted to essentially ignoring us (and I can't say I really blamed him), so he was ill prepared when we flagged him down and began peppering him requests. We want red wine...I want scotch...we want silverware...we want napkins...we want child's meals...we want salads...we want cheesecake...we want...well, you get the drift. Add in the fact that almost no one at the table was able to order any item from the ""menu"" without altering it in some way (really...17,374 items on the menu and we could not find anything we didn't want to change...well, except me...frenched fries and scotch for Donald, por favor). Not much of what we wanted showed up in a coherent manner...my fries (the only thing I ordered...hey, I've been to CF before...lots of them...I know what I want and, more importantly, what I don't want) showed up way before I got my cocktail. Water didn't show up until the 3rd or 4th request was made...tableware didn't show up until after food began to arrive...condiments never arrived (we finally took them from a waiter station). Kiddo meals showed up one at a time over a period of many minutes (and anyone who has ever dined with kids knows that when one kid gets their victuals, all the kids had better be getting their victuals). I'm pretty sure Jethro viewed us as a ""table from hell"" and we probably were...although we are fantastic tippers and he would have done well to respect that fact. Then again, I don't generally wear my lapel pin that says ""Take good care of me...I'm a big tipper!"" Still, CF sort of redeemed themselves with dessert...after all, this is a factory devoted to cheesecake...and god knows I love cheesecake! I grabbed my newly arrived fork and dove in...for exactly 2 bites...we probably should have ordered more cheesecake. I've made my bi-annual (as opposed to semi-annual) visit to the factory, so I'm probably good for a while. Although, since I only got 2 bites of cheesecake, I could be talked into dropping by again for a slice...as long as you're buying."
Priyanka H.,"San Diego, CA",0,17,3,4.0,8/12/2013,"For me a perfect meal would be the Shrimp scampi at Cheesecake factory :) I just love it. It's delicious to say the least! I always order that even though sometimes they don't turn out as well. Among the appetizers, the crab bites are v tasty and come with a yummy sauce. A few dishes here are on the sweeter side like cashew chicken,etc and  I am not  fond of those. Most of the stuff is usually good. The best thing about cheesecake factory is that they serve you warm bread and butter while you are waiting for your order. I am particularly fond of the brown bread.  Among the cheesecakes, I love the chocolate tuxedo."
jacko l.,"Garden Grove, CA",121,145,7,2.0,9/3/2015,Sloooooooow service on a Thurs 1pm lunch. Food was blah. Not terrible just substance to fill your stomach. Would not return to any CCF again. I do not recommend this place either.
Christina P.,"Tustin, CA",90,244,102,2.0,2/27/2012,"Hmmm... I thought I already wrote a review for The Cheesecake Factory and how I couldn't bring myself to finish my meal, or order another entree because there was a piece of saran wrap in my pasta... I took a bite, and felt something slimy in my mouth that I couldn't chew. I thought it might be an onion, but it was a piece of plastic - gross! The great thing about this incident is it shows how involved the manager's are in their service. The server apologized and offered to have a new dish made for me. I had lost my appetite, so I declined. Then the manager stopped by to apologize and make sure I was okay. She offered me a slice of cheesecake, I declined because I had lost faith for the night in anything that hit the table. What gets me is that they didn't remove the pasta from the bill. I ate less than half of it before I stumbled upon my little surprise, and had the dish taken back to the kitchen. I didn't realize I would have to pay for someone else's mistake. Other than that one awful encounter. The food is usually spot on, the service is typically okay, and the portions are oversized - good and bad thing in this world that keeps getting fatter. I probably won't go back for a long time, because there are so many better places out there. Oh, another negative - when my cousin was six years old, he ordered a virgin daquiri. They served him a regular daquiri, and when he told his parents he felt funny, they sipped his drink to find that there was alcohol in there. SERIOUSLY? You didn't notice the drink smelled like alcohol when you dropped it off in front of a SIX YEAR OLD? The manager apologized, obviously. But again, they didn't take the drink off the bill and made them pay for something that could have seriously gotten the restaurant in trouble."
Mai C.,"Irvine, CA",15,55,35,5.0,3/25/2013,I LOVE THE GEORGIA PEACH...OH AND THE AMAZING $5 HAPPY HOUR! We stopped in after munching at R+D Kitchen (I know fatties :P) and came just in time for their amazing happy hour.  We got sat right away on the cozy balcony overlooking the ocean! There are only two tables out there so it was retreat away from the hustle and bustle.  they have a maaaaaasssive HH food selection and every portion is just ginormous.  The cocktails were huge too.  We got the longisland iced tea and the jw pink lemonade. Both huge enough to get us buzzed and smiling!   Totally recommend making this a happy hour destination.  Cheesecake factory is the bomb
It's All About Service ..,"Los Angeles, CA",2,100,1,5.0,12/7/2015,"We love their gluten free burgers. It took us a while to train the take out staff to slow down and take a detailed order with no errors, but we are regular customers. Great food."
Ming-Jou C.,"Dallas, TX",1070,875,388,3.0,1/6/2010,"So I own stock in Cheesecake Factory. Doesn't mean I love the place. But what I do love about it is that mom likes it and she always enjoys going there. So during the holiday break, I took her to the Newport Beach location a couple of times. This place is hit or miss. Sometimes the service is really good, but sometimes it's just off. Mom always gets the Chicken Madeira, I've recently started ordering off the small items menu. From that, you can get a couple of different things for like $5 each! Plus, it's not oversized so you can probably finish it all. I like their beet salad and the pizzettes, which are pretty decent in size. Recently, I tried off their separate menu, the salisbury steak ($13) which came with mashed potatoes and mushroom gravy. OMG, so good, and it was great reheated later as leftovers, too.  I don't like that their bathrooms are like black. The toilets black, everything's black. You don't know what they're hiding in there."
Andrew P.,"Yorba Linda, CA",0,388,,3.0,3/7/2013,"I very much like this place, despite its fairly out of the way location (we're not Newport residents.)  Staff is usually top-notch, and food quality is good. I'm mostly here to bitch about the price differential between this location and others.  Just went to Brea's last night and things were definitively cheaper.  Skinnylicious burger $8.95 at Brea, $9.50 NB.  Skinnylicious Mexican Salad $1 cheaper at Brea. That's weak."
Dee A.,"Irvine, CA",989,77,180,4.0,10/12/2013,"You can't go wrong with Cheesecake Factory, they practically have everything to satisfy any cravings you have.   My family always have different cravings.  Our taste buds can never be all in sync at the same time.  So, we always compromise on Cheesecake Factory since they have an extensive selections of variety of food  from pasta or pizza to tacos and burritos to burgers or steak, seafood, and even 'semi-ethnic food like Orange or Teriyaki Chicken with rice or Bang-Bang Chicken and Shrimp (Thai-like), or Shrimp and Chicken Gumbo or Jambalaya.  The choices are endless!  Every time my family can't agree on a restaurant, Cheesecake Factory always comes to the rescue!  The price is reasonable, and the portions are generous.  The quality of the food is somewhat good depending on what you get.  My main entree' favorites are the Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic , Shrimp Scampi (with extra sauce), Chicken Madeira, and Steak Diane.  Oh and their brown bread and butter, fresh off the oven are great! And for dessert, no need to elaborate, cheesecakes are what they're known for and named after.   Service: Hmmmm, depending on which location you go to, it can get ugly!  We've walked out on some of the locations we've been to in the past, like the Rancho Cucamonga,  Brea and Anaheim locations...especially Rancho Cucamonga!  This branch however, have been consistently okay. In a nutshell, Cheesecake Factory have been a family favorite."
Caleb N.,"Moorpark, CA",75,40,18,3.0,7/25/2014,"The food was good like usual and the price was not too bad. It was not to busy and they got to us really fast, so that's sweet. The only salsas thing was that our server was not too happy and it showed in his customer service. So that's no good, and I am very used to great customer service at other location. Maybe it was just not a good day for him. Well hope next time is a bit better. But again food is really good. And they have a gluten free menu and that's awesome."
Ah K.,"San Pedro, CA",0,34,1,5.0,8/3/2014,"Great place and great food.  With their authentic and exclusive dishes, you are in for a treat. Noticed that their service was slower than usual.  Took a long time to bring the drinks, food, etc.  Other than that the food is superb as expected. Do not forget to order the white chocolate raspberry truffle!!! Only thing missing is free wi-fi !!!"
Shari W.,"Modesto, CA",11,36,9,5.0,1/7/2013,Great service! Very nice and attentive. Guacamole appetizer was delicious.  BBQ chicken Salad was awesome.
Ariana B.,"Brentwood, Los Angeles, CA",110,82,12,5.0,6/18/2014,"I've been eating here for several years and the food never disappoints. I have to say for appetizers go with tex mex or avocado roll, and lettuce wraps!! For salad I would say Chinese chicken or BBQ chicken. And you can't go wrong with the pastas. Most are dry so if you are in the mood for creamy you have to let them know and they will tell you which pastas are creamy. And for dessert.. OREO CHEESECAKE."
