Chad R.,"Vista, CA",19,58,2,4.0,9/27/2012,"I really enjoyed my experience at this particular Cheesecake factory. Our waitress was very attentive, and was really knowledgeable of the menu. As you may know, Cheesecake Factory has a novel that they call a menu, with such a wide variety of dishes to choose from. Our server knew the menu well and made our experience very pleasant. The food was above average as well, I had the salmon salad dish (which I can't remember the exact name of the plate). I recommend getting the fish warm instead of how they serve it cold. The cheesecakes are full of calories and extremely tasty!"
Dawn M.,"Jacksonville, FL",385,373,396,3.0,1/11/2010,"My husband wanted to sample some of the new appetizers including a breaded olive tapa. I wistfully hoped that I would get something delicious but was soundly disappointed yet again. My mahi mahi with a Veracruz sauce was so salty I took one bite and then sent it back. I replaced it with the most mundane thing on the menu that the kitchen couldn't possibly ruin, but they managed. The burger was very dry, very cold and the kiss of mayo was replaced with a stack of red onions, dill pickles and the usual characters which I ditched. The wait had brought both ketchup and mustard which the runner picked up well before I got the burger. She brought them out again after the other parties at my table had already finished their appetizers and dinners. It took well over 1/2 hour later to get the burger but the manager comped that and took the mahi off the bill as well.  The most amusing sight in the bar was the 6'2"" girl with an 8"" tiara and the group that had escaped from a movie set or early prom shivering near the elevator in micro minis and tuxes."
Michelle H.,"Irvine, CA",218,395,47,4.0,8/15/2012,"Of all the cheesecake factories, this one is my favorite. Not only is the service (servers and bussers) really friendly and QUICK, they food is usually out in pretty record time even when the place is jam packed.  This location also has more seating and a better waiting area. Pros: -GREAT service -Good seating space -Food is QUICK Cons: -Wait for a table can be ATROCIOUS on the weekends!  Tips:  -Head over for happy hour! -Eat at the bar (FULL MENU)"
JP A.,"Glendale, CA",70,329,37,4.0,7/16/2012,"This is one of the better Cheesecake Factory locations and if you're lucky enough, you might even get an ocean view. On my last visit service seemed to be average and I did appreciate the manager coming out to right a wrong (hot and spicy buffalo dipping sauce delivered instead of cocktail sauce). I'm not excited about the menu since the main reason for going is the dessert.  Speaking of, the cheesecake was noticeably downsized from previous portions and made up for with a larger amount of whipped cream on the side. Finally, the menu needs to be smaller.  Too much going on..."
Cherie M.,"Los Angeles, CA",107,295,11,3.0,8/15/2012,"The Cheesecake Factory is the favorite place for the bf and I to dine out whenever we're in the area.  Favorite meals have been wedge salad special, chicken and dumplings, pasta carbonara, shishito peppers - but really we're here not to eat food, but cheesecake, lovely lovely simple vanilla bean cheesecake. Went off the normal order on our last visit by trying the seasonal special of pecan pumpkin cheesecake.  I really liked the pecan filling better than the pumpkin, but together they were delicious. And when the tables are filled up, we usually try to grab the bar and order dinner there, they've got a nice view from there."
Daniel L.,"Orange, CA",30,20,1,4.0,7/23/2013,Favorite Cheesecake due to its location. Nice restaurant with a beautiful view of the beach! Great service and same great food! love it. Famous meatloaf is still one of my favorites!
Mark D.,"Garden Grove, CA",0,29,12,1.0,7/30/2015,"For the money, the food was no better than McDonalds.  And valet parking?  That's just ridiculous.  Nice place inside, but the food is really bland and pre-constructed.  The floors were dirty.  The service was terrible - you almost had to tackle someone to get anything, including the check.  And to top things off, for being the "" factory of cheesecake"" , they only had one.  No really, they only had one cheesecake in the front.  I thought they were kidding, but no.  Will never go back there, will never go to another one ever again.  Why on earth have people stooped to eating lousy food in sorta fancy looking places.  Corporate food chains are just bad business.  The food is barf, the service is always terrible because of seasonal or daily changes to the staff, and of course, it's always over priced.  You'd be better off buying frozen cheesecake , letting it thaw out at home and then eat it there."
Sam N.,"Orange County, CA",4996,802,,2.0,7/6/2009,"THe lines are too long, the layout of the restaurant is odd and the food is not as good as other locations. Everyone looked at my group of friends like we were crazy for being colored people in the Fashion Island mall. I didnt have a good experience and I would much rather go to another place in Newport Beach to eat. The servers were pretty nice, but the long lines, weird layout and newport attitude kill this place."
James P.,"San Diego, CA",174,42,52,1.0,6/3/2012,"The last time I remember, red velvet cheesecake would have RED velvet cake and cream cheese in between etc. My friend and I went in today to grab a slice of their famous red velvet cheesecake to go, just to be disappointed by disgusting cheesecake we ended up receiving. We walked in, and the cheesecakes were in the casing to the right of the restaurant. She's only tried the Original Cheesecake, so I told her ""Let's try the Red Velvet!"" We were sharing, so I asked for a slice of the red velvet cheesecake to go. I was rung up within a minute and received the cheesecake within the next two minutes. We brought it home and opened it up. Boy, it did not look like the red velvet I remembered. There are two layers of red velvet cake. Both layers were barely red or not red at all, but more brownish. We took a few bites and could barely swallow it. The cake itself was dry and the cream cheese in between the layers did not taste fresh at all. It seemed like the cake was made in advanced and was never put together until now? Or the whole cheesecake has been in the back refrigerator for a few days before they put it on the shelf. It was just awful. After a few bites, we ended up throwing 95% of the cheesecake in the trash. I expect more from The Cheesecake Factory. I've been here numerous times, and never have I received disgusting food/cheesecake like this before. The friend I was with, swears to never eat at Cheesecake Factory again (or at least this Fashion Island one). It's a bit much, but her first experience with the Red Velvet is something she never wants to deal with again."
David W.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,22,,2.0,11/10/2014,"I went today for the first time in about a year. The service was just OK, and the food about the same -kinda blah. And the portions were way smaller than I recall, but not the prices.It's still OK for cheesecake, but for other food,there are plenty of better options. In fact,that's probably true of the whole mall-it's nothing like it used to be; for shopping, South Coast Plaza is much better all round."
Brad C.,"Carlsbad, CA",323,29,13,3.0,6/30/2012,"Went with friends Paige and Justin, last weekend. The service was good, and we were sat pretty quickly. I ordered the massive breakfast burrito, the burrito was was very tasty and surprising the eggs where light and fluffy inside, with just the right amount of sausage, peppers, onions and cheese.  Justin ordered the giant Belgium waffle, with pecans and strawberries. Justin was pretty disappointed in the lack of syrup and drizzle of whip cream.  Paige ordered the meat loaf sandwich, she said it was very tasty.  We topped off the early brunch with three orders of cheesecake, I ordered the pecan turtle, always a big hit, Justin had the new Hersey's chocolate bar cheesecake, he said it was great, and Paige order the Red Velvet, she said it was good! I wish we had Cheesecake Factory chain in Canada.  Good tasty food, that thousands eat at weekly."
Paul N.,"Newport Beach, CA",0,28,,5.0,5/10/2016,like the Cheesecake Factory in Fashion Island food is good service is excellent I can't wait to go backi get the grilled cheese is always very good   and the shakes are  very yummm and double bacon cheeseburger very good
Cat H.,"Newport Beach, CA",638,794,4,3.0,8/16/2011,"The happy hour specials here are excellent! I popped in with a good friend for some grub and some drinks and managed to catch happy hour. $5 for a plate of sliders? Um, yeah! That being said, definitely get them with cheese. And no onions. But they need some amazing sauce, really. And it's not ketchup. The fries are also good. And cheap liquor specials always warm my heart. We sat at the bar, so we had a full view of the ocean in the distance, and many assorted characters in the bar area. Overall it was a cool experience."
Jeannie H.,"Newport Beach, CA",16,13,,2.0,11/15/2011,"Plain and simple: I'm just not that into you.  I don't understand all the hype about cheesecake factory. It's over priced, generic, oil infused food.  I know people rave about this chain but it just doesn't do it for me.  I ate here with a large group this past weekend. One plus is that the service was good. The hostess (Lauren) was super friendly and set up a table for us right away. I didn't catch our servers name but she handled all 18 of us wonderfully. She was able to split our checks, was on it with the refills, and had a great attitude about helping us out.  I was in an indulgent mood so I ordered crispy mac n cheese. I love cpk (california pizza kitchen)'s version of this dish so i figured i'd give it a shot at cheesecake factory. i was very impressed with the portion size, but not with the actual food. I was hoping for a stronger cheese taste but i guess you can't always get what you want.  xoxo blondie"
Christina G.,"Tustin, CA",0,51,10,2.0,1/2/2015,"Went there for my belated birthday dinner. We were in back corner of restaurant. Took 10 minutes to even get acknowledged. Another 10 to get drinks. Saw another table get rolls. We were never offered rolls. Our waitress went on break, so we altered between two other waiters. Long wait to get appetizers, and eventually dinner. When we looked around to find someone to get our bill, original waitress came back, and muttered ""Oh, I thought they dropped this off"". Ok food, but not great service."
Albert L.,"Pomona, CA",1295,573,1338,4.0,2/14/2010,"This is my favorite Cheesecake Factory restaurant to dine in...if you're lucky enough to get a nice window seat during the late afternoon and watch the sun set over the coast!  Location, location, location. I won't bother reviewing the food as it's the same with any Cheesecake Factory out there and the interior looks like any other Cheesecake Factory as well. The service is good and the restaurant has some prime real estate on Fashion Island so there's plenty of places to walk around once you've had your fill of food."
Jen L.,"Orange, CA",0,31,1,3.0,5/10/2015,Used to love this place but service has suffered recently and they are changing up go-to dishes. The new chicken and biscuits is a major disappointment and is more like a deconstructed chicken pot pie. The last two times I had the luau salad it was drowning in dressing. Time for the management to run a tighter ship.
Afshin M.,"Irvine, CA",11,25,8,4.0,7/9/2014,"Good service , reasonable price, like it. But sometimes especially in weekends it is too busy to be sited."
Amien P.,"San Francisco, CA",42,93,,4.0,1/19/2012,"One of my fav places to eat at FI usually there's a wait, you can always see if the little patio with two tables is available, great views.  I usually get the soup and sandwhich combo which is a steal or the factory burger mmm. portions are huge, just get the rest togo. and there you go a midnight snack or dinner. Servers are generally nice, but very busy, so sometimes you might be helped by various servers you flag down."
David W.,"Newport Beach, CA",0,33,,1.0,3/11/2016,"I've been going to this place for years and the food has always been solid. However, the services this time was totally unprofessional. I called for a curb side take away. After being put on hold on the phone for a few minutes, a woman came on the phone saying they can't do curb side. She was very rude and short with me. I asked her why....her respond was ""I can't let the girl in the bakery leave the restaurant"". I tried to tell her I had 3 kids in the car and it would be a big production to drag them all up the stairs to pick-up our food. She didn't want to hear any of it and was quite rude and just said ""no"". I asked why do they offer curb side take away and even have parking spots reserved when they can't provide the services when needed??? She couldn't give me an answer.  I'm done with restaurants that provide bad services. I will be calling corporate to let them know the poor services at this location."
