Bob M.,"Anaheim, CA",7,6,,1.0,7/24/2011,"We love the cheesecake factory, what's not to love, great food, fair prices.  Never been to this one in Newport however, but after this visit, will never go back.  We had an over 2 hour ordeal at lunch where the 6 people in our party all recieved their food at different times over an hour and a half. The last meal to arrive was a salad of all things.  Things did not even start well when the waiter said there was no bread, and we had to wait 30 minutes before a single basket arrived.  The manager did stop by to apologize at some point and said something about a computer problem.  No offer however of a free dessert or anything to those who had long finished their meal.  In fact, they charged us for an ice tea we had sent back.  They did take that one off when I complained.  When the meals arrived they were barely warm, almost room temperature. Interesting, all the poeple around us were getting their meals and coming and going over the 2 hours. Like I said, I love the Cheesecake factory, but thankfully, there are many other choices at the Newport Center."
Cori G.,"Irvine, CA",468,235,112,4.0,12/15/2011,"I totally just went to cheesecake factory two days in a row. :/  Somehow we ended up here today and two days of deliciousness can't be bad.. I ordered the skinnylicious burger here too. At this location, their burger was not as good as the one at the Grove in LA, but the salad was better. The skinnylicious burger is a smaller-than-glamburger, yet very thick burger.  It is delicious and filling which is nice for a diet menu. Our server Alex was really nice and attentive. We came at lunch time on a Thursday and had no wait.  The views are a good enough reason to come here on a clear day, as it has a GORGEOUS panoramic view of the ocean. (So does the P.F. Changs next door) Fashion Island is also a nice place to visit, but if you are here from out of town and have some money (which you might, if you are in Newport Beach) I would recommend one of the smaller chain restaurants like Brasserie Pascal, Great Maple, or even Canaletto Ristorante Veneto if you are looking for fine dining."
Jireh H.,"Monterey, CA",1049,365,1472,3.0,10/23/2011,"Interesting. Extensive menu with creative items for the American palette. Ambiance is busy but still great for conversations - both casual and intimate. Service is either friendly or straight-forward. Wait time to be seated varies depending on time/day. I'll be honest and to the point that the food is just okay. What can you possibly expect just from the name itself? It pretty much applies to all the previous Cheesecake Factories I've been to in the past. It's the same, I can't complain, just be there for the time with friends instead of some gastronomic experience. Now, here's the main catch. If you don't care about desserts, you're definitely in the wrong place. Okay food and ambiance simply points to the real purpose anyone should be here - to have dessert. Oh, they will so throw it in your face at the end of your ""meal."" As one of my friends who was there accurately said...they make experienced car and shoe salesmen look like beginners. If you wonder what I thought about his comment that night... How about the fact that our cursed table fell to the dessert siren's call and ordered a [large, unnecessary, absurd, sugar-packed] dessert *EACH* for the ultimate diabetic experience..."
Emily H.,"Portland, OR",220,160,19,4.0,11/3/2011,"Five dollars...what can you REALLY buy with five dollars?  One pair of underwear from Victoria's Secret? A bottle of shampoo? OR how about one order of: mojito / tex mex eggrolls / deep fried mac and cheese / sliders / fried chicken sliders / tamales / long island / spring rolls / nachos / fried wontons / buffalo chicken / artichoke dip / chips / cosmopolitan / etc. ... JUST $5 EACH! Happy hour, 4-6pm, Monday - Friday Sure makes me HAPPY!"
Colette K.,"Orange County, CA",190,227,106,4.0,4/4/2011,"$5 happy hour appetizers! There are at least 12 appetizers on the happy hour menu. The house cab was decent. The bartender was so busy that the service was slow.  $20= 2 appetizers, 1 glass of wine, nice tip"
Izzy H.,"Newport Beach, CA",24,37,1,2.0,8/20/2015,"I know that the servers at the Cheesecake Factory train for 3 months so they know how to cater to customers' different needs. Usually the food is fine and the service great. Yesterday we were served by a surly gentleman who looked like someone had stepped on the only nerve he had. No smile, no ""good evening"" - nothing. Okay------let's move on. I ordered my favorite dish - chicken piccata. As it come with totally dried out angel hair pasta I always ask for extra sauce on the side. Of course, Mr Happiness did not bring it. After requesting it the 2nd time he dumped a tiny bowl of ALFREDO sauce on the table. As the lights are not that bright I tossed it on the angel hair and totally ruined the taste of the piccata's tangy taste. Really ??? Really Mr Happiness did you train for 3 months?? I doubt it!!! Did the management credit us - Nooooooo! With all these wonderful restaurants at Fashion Island I do not need to go to the Cheesecake Factory again and face these miserable servers who are either too lazy or too stupid to get the clients' food right! No wonder there are no more lines at this location."
Cheng S.,"Anaheim, CA",2,4,,2.0,6/18/2014,"Im not happy with the services, especially the reception desk, I and my boyfriend came in, and there is an waitress put a table for us, told us to wait shortly, then we seated on the bench for just seconds, there were a couple came in, as soon as we heard the receptionist's voice, she asked the couple how many and take them to the table, we thought maybe she did.not see us, ok, fine, we wil wait for next call, then there were three people came in, and the receptionist take them to the table again, we totally being ingored, then we came to the reception desk and wait for the receptionist came out, we waited for seconds, then she came, I told her about it, and she said "" I thought you guys were waiting for to go or something else, I don't know about it, I'm sorry but I can take you to the table now,"" the thing is she did see us, but she did not ask us were we waiting for a table or to go, i think the attitude and the manner was really bad, and the way she talked to us like ""I don't know..."" what does it mean by she doesn't know, maybe we have ASIAN FACES, so she discriminate us and talked in that arrogant tone, we were very disappoint of the her attitude, and would not come here again, it happend aboud 3:40 pm at The Cheesecake Factory in Fashion Island, Newport Beach."
Al G.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,7,,1.0,5/25/2014,"I went to this location one day and had one of the worst experiences ever in a restaurant.  I took the option to seat myself at the bar/lounge. Even though it was busy that night, no one came to give me a menu, so I fetched on myself.  Upon returning to my seat, my server (Elizabeth B.) finally came, and then said ""I saw you get up and I thought you left.""  I then finally made my order.  They got me my strawberry lemonade and complimentary bread.  I also asked for water.  The order took awhile, and aside from the crowd I still was being neglected.  Finally got my dish and after a few bites they asked how was it, and I told them it was adequate.  They didn't like my answer so the insisted to get the manager.  They finally got the manager over and I told them that the food was overcooked and that the service they provided for me was substandard.  So then they got the nerve to make me order something from the dessert menu, and I didn't even want any dessert.  They didn't even say it was complimentary, and so I firmly said I will not be having any dessert.  I just asked for my check so I can just pay and put this night behind me.  They were willing to comp the entire meal, and I firmly said no and ordered them to take the card and pay.  A couple days later, I went back and they still didn't give me a menu when I opted to sit at the bar/lounge high tables.  WTH!  I thought of giving them the benefit of the doubt."
Marya J.,"Newport Beach, CA",101,40,36,4.0,1/15/2013,"We eat here OFTEN.  On  a couple occassions we were forgotten.  But most often, this place is predictable.  Food is good, and comforting.  Even a skinny menu for those times when we want to eat an still feel good about it."
Leila J.,"San Jose, CA",50,23,,4.0,10/10/2013,We like Cheesecake Factory.  The portions are large so we can share what we order. The menu is also very diverse :-)
Christopher M.,"Vernon Rockville, CT",193,9,2,4.0,4/16/2012,"We love the cheesecake factory. My girlfriend always gets the Cajun Chicken pasta, it is very good. Myself I love a lot on the menu. For example the Steak Diane (however you say it) and the lunch shepards pie.  What I love: Atmosphere is pretty nice. Nice view. Foods great! Don't love: Menu is wayyy too long, Appetizer section is several pages, as well as each entree area. Few pages of desserts etc. Hard to find the perfect thing with such a large menu, and it makes me think how fresh some things could be, if its so large they must prep much of it for the week etc. Also its a little pricy, my GF and me went for lunch, bill was 52 dollars, tipped an extra 10 bucks. So 62 dollars... is kind of tough for me being 23 years old. However Its WORTH IT! I love the place."
Thomas King F.,"Newport Beach, CA",0,1,,5.0,2/17/2015,"We sat tonight at the bar section with Leigh. She was quite lovely. Even though there was a small mistake with our order, her charming personality made up for it with great customer service."
Cassie P.,"Newport Beach, CA",72,1624,140,3.0,6/14/2009,"We got a gift card to eat here....I haven't been back since my last review....why???  This place is just plain bad for you....everything is fried and fat laden!  Even the ""weight management"" salads have 590 calories!!!  That is a lot people!!!!  Everyone eating here was fat.   I still give it 3 stars because the service is great and for as big as that menu is, the food comes out fast and pretty tasty....of course everything tastes good when it is filled with fat, oil, salt and preservatives!"
Ed J.,"Cerritos, CA",8,16,,4.0,3/19/2011,"We've eaten at this store several times, and always had a great experience.  The menu is extensive and the service is always good to execellent.  Our favorite dish is the Chicken Madeira, which we typically share beacause the portion size is so large.  Great bar with terriific ocean views. Highly recommended.   The only caveat is that if you go at a busy time, there is often a long wait."
Gale V.,"Huntington Beach, CA",14,10,1,5.0,3/30/2015,I love it there.. Everyone treats you like their family. The manager Selina  is such a great person .. They were busy and things were getting crazy... the manager Selina was so sweet to us .. Love her!
Bori S.,"Placentia, CA",82,13,,2.0,9/26/2013,Terrible service from Alisha! Appetizers took 20minutes to order and everything was SO slow. We had to fill ourselves with bread :( not recommended
Reyz A.,"San Jose, CA",246,768,388,3.0,2/9/2011,"Yes it is a chain and in a mall. But it was the first Cheesecake Factory I ever went to in southern California many years ago. Fascist Island or Fashion Island location is very glitzy for us tourists from the north, so this added to the fashionation of the place for me. Recently, it was a standard visit to have a little burger. I believe they are switching to a new menu, but I did catch the Kobe burger of the same name-sake famous beef with some sauteed mushrooms and onions on a toasted bun. It was enjoyable. I tried the healthy  twist by skipping the fries and going for the green salad. Of course the dessert would have to be some kind of cheesecake. Check ahead for your favs to see if they are in stock for that day. I always like the fresh banana cheesecake. I have to be biased that this location in Newport beats any other Cheesecake factory elsewhere here in northern California. The mall is not a standard enclosed mall, and the big glass window overlooking the Pacific from inside the restaurant makes  this location unique."
Christina B.,"Westmoreland, NH",42,265,2,3.0,8/31/2010,"There are three very important lessons about food service I learned from Anthony Bourdain. 1. Never order fish on Monday 2. Food on a buffet is made from leftover crap 3. If the menu is too large and varied, everything will suck. Cheesecake Factory hits number 3 pretty much on the head.  Almost everything I've had is pretty bad.  I believe most of their appetizers are prepackaged crap just tossed into a deep fryer.  However, amazingly enough, they have one of the best chophouse-style burgers you can find.  Decent meat, well-seasoned, good bun with the requisite tomato-lettuce-onion.  Dab a little of their garlic mayo on if you're feeling frisky. We also like to come here because when it's not crowded, it's a good, relaxing place to take the hamkey.  It's not crazy loud if you get the right booth, and she has room to wiggle around before the food arrives so she doesn't get too impatient.  The servers have been really good with her too--the last time we went our server, Shelly F, brought out some banana slices and broccoli for her to nibble on.  Big thumbs up!"
William S.,"ASTORIA, NY",1,26,10,3.0,8/19/2013,Out of all the Cheesecake Factory restaurants I've been to this one is the cheapest service of all of them. They never have the kids plate with bread and bananas and you have to ask them to refill your bread and water. For such an exclusive neighborhood you'd think they'd be better. I'd rather go to the one at the Spectrum Irvine for a better kid-friendly environment.
Meg R.,"Irvine, CA",409,558,322,3.0,7/8/2010,"Eh. it was alright, but its definitely a chain restaurant and has the flaws that come with that.  I got the cashew chicken salad, it was slimey and the wontons in it were more awkward than anything. Good peanut sauce dressing, but wayy too much of it.  tried a bite of the Louisiana pasta, there was too much butter on the pasta but it seemed alright.  As far as ambiance- too loud! it was hard to have a conversation and it was really busy and distracting.  no problems with service at least! but still not likely to return."
