Shannon T.,"Irvine, CA",4,38,14,4.0,1/1/2011,"I like Cheesecake Factory. Always have.  Like most places - its a chain. The plus is that you will always get what you expect no matter which Cheesecake Factory you are at. The downside is the food is so-so compared to some non-chain places. I like the versatility of the Cheesecake Factory. You can use it for a quick catch up session with a girlfriend, a casual date with your significant other or a quick catch up session with a big group of people.  The food is good, and reasonably priced. The nice thing is that almost everyone will find SOMETHING they like here - so its a nice safe place to go when you have a bunch of people who's food preferences you don't know. Also, of course, its a great place for dessert junkies. Wide variety of cheesecake choices plus other options. And I don't even like cheesecake but many of their cheesecake variations don't have the really cheese cream flavor that classic cheesecakes have and are delicious."
Daryl E.,"Twin Falls, ID",22,184,25,4.0,11/22/2012,Excellent meal with quick service.  Love Cheesecake Factory!  Always go when I'm in Newport!  Friendly staff with great food that is reasonably priced. Can't go wrong here.
Brooke C.,"Costa Mesa, CA",123,31,,3.0,5/12/2013,"I visited this location with my mom and my aunt on Easter. We sat in the bar area. Our server was Arianna. She was so helpful with everything and made a genuine connection with us. She came back to check on us multiple times and really showed that she cared that we were there and enjoying everything. I would give just Arianna 5 stars if i could, but unfortunately i returned this past weekend with my little sisters. We had just finished the color run and had been up all day and were very hungry. I came here because I was expecting to get the same amazing service that I had gotten previously. Unfortunately i did not. We sat in the bar area, again. Our server dropped off 2 drink napkins (there were 3 of us) and then left, without saying a word. Went back to 2 other tables and did not come back for a few more minutes. We then put in our entire order at the same time and did not see her for another 7 minutes. No drinks (which we got water with lemon, come on that does not take that long to get) and 2 appetizers. At this pointe we were starting to get very hungry and antsy because we had been there for at least 15 minutes and usually within the first 5 they bring the basket of bread. We hadn't even gotten that. Oh and did i mention she never even gave us her name. We watched her go up to 3 other tables and make sure they had everything (twice). And yet when it came to us she wouldn't even look our way.  I then talked to a manager about how disappointed i was, and the manager was not too friendly herself either. By the end of the visit, we had 4 different servers, only one of them introduced herself and took care of us like I expected.  This visit was by far the worst visit I had ever had and I was greatly disappointed  I am hoping at our next visit that we will be lucky enough to have Arianna as our server again, as for the other girl that barely acknowledged us....learn how to smile every once in a while, it will make your life so much more enjoyable and you won't look like a rude snob."
Elizabeth N.,"Irvine, CA",82,137,112,2.0,10/7/2012,"Oh Cheesecake Factory....what can I say about you? I think that you are completely over priced and your food is mediocre. Came here on a date with my bf and bff. The service here is nice...acceptable...but the food here....was eh. My salad was bland and whoever cut my vegetables doesn't know how to use a knife. All of my vegetables were different shapes and sizes....come on...seriously? I'm sorry, but how can I enjoy my salad when it is bland and I have a huge chunk of raw bell pepper in my mouth? I rarely come here....so I don't think I will be back for a while."
Bill E.,"Orange, CA",98,166,21,4.0,11/21/2010,I had the BBQ Chicken Salad which was excellent. Server was very nice and we had a great seat for a business lunch. In and out quickly just like we asked. A+ Visit.
Allison P.,"Newport Beach, CA",164,221,59,4.0,2/22/2011,"My grams and I came here this last Saturday. The cold weather did not keep people away. The Cheesecake Factory was packed, with a 10 minute wait. I decided to eat here because I had a $10 gift card, from taking a survey after my last visit here. My grams waited at the bar, overlooking the ocean. We were sat in a nice big booth, ordered drinks and lunch. We split the lunch size Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic. It was delicious and perfect size for both of us with zero leftovers. I was tempted to order cheesecake, but had no more room."
S. M.,"Rancho Mirage, CA",439,270,13,3.0,2/9/2014,"Really busy saturday and they had construction going on. Decor is not as nice as some other cheesecake factories that I've been to. Ordered the spicy cashew chicken but sent it back because it was pretty bad. Then ordered the fried shrimp platter, a dish I've had several times before and is always reliable. Nothing special about this place."
Carrie B.,"Orange County, CA",274,86,106,3.0,8/22/2010,"Hey, you know what sucks about dining with a party of 6 or more?  Splitting up the bill!  I was suprised that this location was accomodating enough to give everyone their own separate checks because when I went with a different group to CF at the Garden Walk they only split the check into 3 separate ones for a party of 15! Dinner was quite late and I tried to be carb conscious so I opted for one specialty drink, the strawberry creamsicle (i don't know why I ordered this because I don't like to drink creamy alcoholic beverages) and a santa fe salad which consisted of grilled lime-marinated chicken, black beans, corn, tortilla strips, and a delicious spicy peanut -cilantro vinaigrette dressing.  My meal was delicious and the dish was so big that I had the salad for a snack and lunch the following day."
Debi C.,"Gilbert, AZ",12,23,,5.0,8/11/2011,"We do tend to spend a lot of time going to different Cheesecake Factory's and this time we were in Newport Beach, CA and couldn't believe the service.  We got there about 4:00 on Saturday afternoon and we had a great (female) server named Alex.  My husband has allergies, my father-in-law 88 years old and very sick so everything we did was slow!!  She offered to go into the kitchen and ask whet my husband could eat without garlic ( which is 99% of their food!) and came back and told us what he could eat, he didn't like the options so she asked the kitchen to make him up something special AND THEY DID.  Please understand, we didn't even ask for that!  My father-in-law need extra care and this girl was right on it. Cheesecake Factory..you should be very proud of this employee...Great job Alex!! Thank you again"
Angela C.,"Orange County, CA",227,1627,693,3.0,3/25/2008,"This one is located in Fashion Island.  My coworkers and I came here for lunch one day and it's just as consistent as most other cheesecake factories.  They promptly seated us after a 5 minute wait.  We got a basket full of hot bread... but the butter plate was dirty on the bottom - gross!!  I'm not feelin' that.  A few of us touched it and had to wash our hands. I ordered the lunch portion miso salmon, which is as good as always - can't go wrong with that dish.  They forgot to add the creamy sauce below the rice on one of the orders though so we had to ask the waiter for another plate.  Cheesecake is consistent every time I come, but the dirty dish and forgetfulness called for a minus one star."
Maria T.,"Santa Monica, CA",690,482,12,5.0,3/4/2010,"5 stars for their new happy hour (4-6pm) which is the BEST HAPPY HOUR EVER!   Thanks to Hien V. for sharing this latest discovery! EVERYTHING on their HH is $5... they have probably 20 or more full-sized apps including the sweet corn tamales, pizettes (mini pizzas), fried mac and cheese, grilled artichoke... and the list goes on and on.  These are the apps that normally go for $8-13 dollars folks!  Highly recommend the sweet corn tamales...but then again, everything that we tried was really great.  They also have mojitos, red and white wine, beer, all for $5.  The Mondavi Cabernet was surprisingly good and you obviously can't beat the price.   Well done, Cheesecake Factory.  You're kicking the economy's ass one fried macaroni and cheese ball at a time!"
Soh-Young L.,"Irvine, CA",20,30,2,2.0,2/12/2011,"1) it was my friends 21at birthday. She ordered a daiquiri. The waiter didn't even bother asking her if she wanted a regular or a virgin, and gets her a virgin daiquiri. And she doesn't look like she's 12 or something, she looks reasonably her age. 2) One of us told the waiter that it was her birthday, so they said ""pick a cheesecake."" and then when the bill comes out, they charged us for it. WTF. ""oh pick a dessert, but your paying for it"" is pretty much what they were getting at. 3) We were a party of 17. Most of us had cards, and so we asked if we could split the bill, and one waiter said ""yes, that's fine, just write down your card number and how much they're supposed to charge on it."" Then, our personal waiter comes up and says that we can only use 5 cards at the most because it's ""easier."" Seriously??? Would've only given them 1 star, but after talking to the manager, they gave us the 3 cheesecakes that we ordered for free. Still never coming back here again."
Justin K.,"Bothell, WA",459,64,26,4.0,2/7/2013,"i used to work here for almost 5 years.  i gotta say this location is way better than other locations.  ive been to brea, i got my drink after i got my avocado egg rolls. they shouldve known that i worked at cheesecake.  anyways.  servers are good (most of them) food is way better than other locations because alot of cooks and preps have been there since day one. which is over 10years ago. prep cooks make so much different. and then line cooks delivers amazing food. i miss my jambalaya"
Shane M.,"Nashville, TN",420,21,,4.0,8/18/2010,"I can't believe I'm actually writing a review for a Cheesecake Factory. Every CF I've ever been to provides the same level of average service, food, and decor. Accordingly, the price is moderate. I went with my girlfriend tonight, and ordered the Grilled Chicken Club. It had avocado, tomatoes, lettuce... you know, standard fare club sandwich. Like everything at CF, it was served in a ""Wal-Mart Lovin' Portion"", supersized. It also came with a small mountain of french fries. (If there's one thing CF nails EVERY time, it's fries. Of course, being the king of french fries is like being the king of special education, so I'm not going to give them a better review for it.) Our waitress was friendly, laughed at my terrible jokes (I always test my waitstaff to see if they'll laugh at terrible jokes.), and handled her overall workload well. She appeared to have many tables, so that's actually saying something. She was attentive, served the food in a timely manner, and kept our drinks full. The waitress gets 5 stars. The food gets 3. That's how we ended up with a 4-Star review. Dessert, of course, was a slice of Cookie Dough Cheesecake, which we shared. It was just about what I expected it to be. Good, but not amazing Cheesecake. The only reason this review even happened? The view. Holy crap, the view is amazing. My advice? Sit outside. There's a GREAT view of the Pacific Ocean. If you go at the right time of day, you'll barely notice the haze from pollution. If you're going to Cheesecake Factory, you probably don't need my review to know what sort of experience you're in for. I'm only giving this one extra-credit for location. And the fact that since it's Cheesecake Factory, they serve everything, so I can get what I want, and she can get what she wants - and we'll both leave without hating each other. Oh, and this place is full of comical Orange County housewives. Love the velour tracksuits, ladies. The mafia-don look is good for you."
Rebecca P.,"Newport Beach, CA",0,8,,5.0,10/2/2013,"I LOVE cheesecake! Who doesn't? They have tasty buffalo blasts, chicken littles, and too many other dishes to name."
Jeanie C.,"Bend, OR",175,109,101,5.0,1/7/2008,"I agree. You just can't go wrong with Cheesecake Factory, pretty much any location. First of all, they have good bread. I always ask for just wheat, it tastes better than the white. Second, I've always enjoyed my meal here. I've wondered if anything on the menu can be bad? So sometimes, I'll pick a random dish. Til this day, I have not been disappointed. (Maybe I cheated because I stay away from the low calorie items- most of these are always horrible) These are my favorites of each section Appetizer: Factory Favorite Specialities: Shepard's Pie Pasta: Spicy Chicken Chipotle Chicken: Chicken Madeira Salad: Luau Salad Sandwich: The Incredible Grilled Eggplant Cheesecake: White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle!! Their service can be good or bad, depending on the server, and how crowded the place is at the moment. But I'm not bothered too much by it when I'm here. When I take a bite out of the creamy, delicious cheesecake, I'm in a state of bliss and my surrounding seem far in the distant..."
Tiger L.,"Diamond Bar, CA",344,72,11,1.0,5/29/2010,"First let me say we've been to Cheesecake Factory many times so we had an expectation.  This was only my second time at the Newport location, a little smaller, and not a busy as Brea, Pasadena, or Arcadia.  Everything was okay, until the waiter and kitchen messed up 1/2 our order, and only 1/2 the food showed up. Notified the waiter, and the mgr shows up and says ""heard there was a mix-up"" suggesting it was our miscommunication, rather than saying they messed up, and would take care of it immediately.  What a douche move! They never even apologized, or offer desert, or anything.  Some of the food was burnt, and overcooked.  The waiter wouldn't even come back to follow up either.  At the end, we still ordered desert, and payed for it, of course.  Unfortunely for them, the waiter missed out on a gratutity, for a table of 6 entrees, appetizers, and drinks. Last time we go here, guess we'll stick with Brea!"
Francisco D.,"Long Beach, CA",4,4,1,4.0,2/24/2013,"Good food, attendants provide a good experience too. I just wish the music wasn't so damn loud... it really takes away from the experience :( But overall it is good so we keep going back. Try the four cheese pasta (it's enough for two people) and the tamales... they are delicious."
Ai M.,"Bellflower, CA",100,2017,4020,3.0,10/15/2008,"Calamari are soggy leftovers.  Carbonara is my favorite but I for lunch, the soup and salad special is great.  I like the crab cakes and mashed potatoes.  My cousin always orders the grilled skirt steak because its tasty.  Shrimp with angel hair is somehow inadequatte and teriyaki chicken is disgusting.   Strawberry cheesecake is good for dessert.  The best thing here is the brown bread.  Tiramisu was decent."
S R B.,"La Habra, CA",0,14,,4.0,9/26/2013,"Beautiful location. We got one of the two tables outside on the balcony overlooking the ocean. Any opportunity to eat outside and see the ocean gets my vote! It is like your own private restaurant. We were not forgotten outside, and no additional wait for service or food. My old fashioned burger was cooked just as I asked, medium rare. It brought back memories of the great burgers I got at the Beverly Hills location in the early 1980's, though the burger is a little smaller and less fries than before (Ok for me. Still plenty to eat) Cheesecake Factory is consistent in food quality and presentation. Another reason I like to eat outside at CF is that it is much quieter. Part of the atmosphere at most CF's is noise. I prefer quieter, but I know that going in and the food and location are still a draw. A woman in our group reported that the Lady's room was not clean, so they should work on that."
