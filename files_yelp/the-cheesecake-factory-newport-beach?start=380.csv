John T.,"San Pedro, Los Angeles, CA",16,24,,5.0,1/31/2013,Good service and the kobe burger was orgasm on the taste buds
Adam F.,"Irvine, CA",97,105,108,5.0,9/8/2012,"Standard Cheesecake Factory but with one major difference- just about all the seats seemed to have a partial view or full view of the ocean.  Kind of a nice bonus.  Service was good, food was the same as all the other Cheesecake Factories I have been to, and the cleanliness was top notch (no sticky menus or table tops).  Maybe it's just me, but everything just seems a little better when you're at fashion island.  I'll come back when I'm around."
Brit S.,"Westminster, CA",110,39,3,4.0,8/5/2012,"My husband and I came here after watching an 11 am showing of the Dark Knight Rises. The Cheesecake Factory is my favorite restaurant in general so I was looking forward to eating. Our waitress, of course, was very polite and seated us quickly. It kind of seems like they're starting to change up their policy on the bread they give out. They used to bring it out immediately as soon as you sit down, but the last numerous times we've had to eventually ask for it once we saw they weren't going to bring it out. Anyway, I ordered my favorite dish which is the Luau Salad. When they brought it out to me I found a hair on my plate! I kindly asked the waitress for a new one and she quickly whisked it away, apologizing profusely. My husband had already gotten his food, which was also a sald, so I started eating his and we decided we might as well just share that since he wasn't going to eat it all. So I flagged down the waitress and told her to just cancel my order. Another waiter came over and offered to give us each a bowl of clam chowder on the house to make up for the hair debacle. I was even more impressed when the manager came over and offered his most sincere apology and offered to also give us an entree to take home on the house. I couldn't belive how much they bent over backwards to make up for something that wasn't a big deal. Everyone has hair and I'm sure I've eaten my fair share! But they were so polite, apologetic and eager to make it up to us which made me very happy. Most places won't go so far out of their way, but this place did, and I applaud them for it. So we ordered a pizza to take home to the kids! Overall, I was very impressed with the management of this restaurant and I would definitely go back! Thanks again!"
MaryAnne S.,"Long Island, NY",468,97,12,5.0,12/15/2012,"This is my favorite place!!! I come here as much as I can. There are a few dishes I would recommend, #1 - Hibachi Steak, #2 Chicken Marsala. The people here are sooo friendly and the atmosphere is wonderful - I love it!"
Jemmie T.,"Rowland Heights, CA",110,28,2,4.0,10/28/2012,Yummy! the steaks are always a favorite of mine and their pastas are yummy!! Service was good as well.
Mae M.,"Long Beach, CA",171,146,6,2.0,9/28/2009,"Some of my coworkers and I had to go offsite for a meeting, and since the place that we were going to go to was right by Fashion Island, we thought we'd have lunch at the Cheesecake Factory.  I have to start off by telling you that I love Cheescake Factory.  It is one of my favorite places to eat. At this location it took us a while to get seated, but we had a nice view of the parking lot.  The restaurant itself was pretty big.  The decor was elegant.  There were a lot of people eating there, but we were seated in a section that wasn't so busy. We informed our waitress that we had to leave for a business meeting in an hour so the waitress took our drink orders immediately, got us our drinks and put our food orders in. There were only 4 of us.  I ordered a salad, and the other people in my group ordered a sandwich, fish tacos, some seared tuna and a different kind of salad.  We got our drinks right away and didn't see the waitress since she brought us our beverages. We were about to leave some money on the table for our drinks and just leave because the waitress didn't come back and it was half an hour since we last saw her.  Just as we were going to get up and go, she came by and dropped some bread off.  She said that the orders should be right up.   We looked around and noticed that everyone else that surrounded us already got their meals.  It was pretty annoying. We called the waitress back and told her that we needed to get to go boxes because we had to leave for our meeting.   We got the boxes even before we got our food.   Needless to say, we were late for our meeting. Food at the Cheesecake Factory is always consistent and I love it, but I give this location a bad rating because of their service. Pee-eew!!"
Faisal M.,"Tustin, CA",194,35,18,5.0,9/4/2012,"I love cheesecake factory this place rocks the best. Food the service is great the manager Scott came out and greeted are table being an owner of a restuarant my self I love the personal touch that Scott gave us making sure we were enjoying every aspect to are dining experience ,very professional:)"
Geoff S.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",21,96,10,5.0,9/4/2012,"Not only is The Cheesecake Factory my favorite restaurant, this location is probably my favorite. I always get the pizza with everything on it. There's no need for me to look through the novel sized menu. I also love the dinner salad I order before the pizza and the brown bread I get before that. You can also see the ocean depending on where you sit."
Al S.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",1251,506,242,4.0,9/2/2009,"When most of the chain restaurants, as far as I'm concerned, have been going down, down, down in overall quality, Cheesecake Factory seems to be holding its own. Rating a particular Cheesecake location, for me, is tough, because I travel quite a bit, and have eaten at several throughout the Western states. The Newport location.....? Outside of a bad day, bad visit or bad kharma, it averages right back to being a 4-star provider. I travel throughout the Western US, and to name a few, have eaten at the CF in Tigard, OR, Marina Del Rey, Tyler Mall Riverside, Irvine Spectrum, Huntington Beach off the 405, (just last week), Mission Viejo, and Mission Gorge (?) off the 8, in San Diego, and Newport Beach, just to mention a very few. And when in Scottsdale recently, at the Grand Luxe.... which is an ""upgraded version in the CF restaurant family."" My 4-stars really goes to all the CF's I've ever visited. I must be lucky, because I've yet to have mediocre to poor service at any of their locations. My favorite menu items right now? I like the stuffed mushroom appetizer in that cheese sauce, followed by the chicken madera and BBQ chicken salad or Santa Fe salad. I find it's great to split the chicken and salad entrees, as the chicken usually comes with two breasts and plenty of potatoes. The full salad portion is huge. The only downside for me at CF is the cheesecake. I bake cheesecake, and am always ready to try someone's ""best ever cheesecake."" Last time I tried the NY lemon cheesecake (plain) at the Tyler Mall location, I was totally depressed. It wasn't  deserving any kudoos, and actually tasted store-bought. Unfortunately, for me to properly rate their cheesecakes again, I'd have to do a taste testing of all the flavors. That presents a problem. Either I'd get type II diabitis in the process, or somewhere in week two, I'd develope ""chubby finger syndrome"", and either the pen would continually fall out of my hand, or my ""cheesecake fattened digits"" would continually hit 3 to 5 keys at once on the computer keyboard......... either way, the review would be inaccurate and/or would never get done in a reasonable period of time. I may have to just order one flavor per visit and take really good notes."
Omer,"Honolulu, HI",427,56,74,4.0,9/24/2014,i like their fresh salmon and of course cheese cake..
Hien V.,"Honolulu, HI",62,188,23,4.0,3/24/2010,"I've tried just about everything  at Cheesecake Factory and I'm sure you have to! Some favorites: Shrimp Scampi, Chicken Madeira, and Chicken Bang Bang. Most plates range anywhere from $12-$25. They're lunch specials are pretty much the same offerings at dinner but for a slightly smaller portion and cheaper price. Now, if you want  a good deal...check out their happy hour from  4PM to 6PM Monday through Friday. In regards to food, this is probably one of the best happy hour deals in town! Full-size appetizers that normally cost $7-$10 will all be $5! Such items include avocado eggrolls, spinach dip, shrimp summer roll, made to order guacamole, Tex Eggrolls, fried calamari, nachos, sliders, etc. There are so many mouth watering dishes to try but it is an absolute must to get the sweet corn tamale cakes...as Maria T. described it...it was orgasmic. Sweet buttery corn cake with a savory mixture of avocado and tomatoes. Another noteworthy dish was the fried chicken sliders, tasty soft buns and crispy on the outside, most on the inside chicken! $5 specialty cocktails, select wine by the glass and well drinks are a great option to wash down the mound of food you'll devour. Side note - ladies, (or some gents) if you are wearing heels, be very careful. They're floors are super slippery and after a few cocktails, you might be playing slip and slide if you're not cautious."
Tim E.,"Brea, CA",631,1154,2475,1.0,10/16/2009,This Cheese cake factory sucked. The waiter was cool but I don't like dust particles and a piece of dried up leaf in my strawberry lemonade. That was a total turn-off. My last refill I was irked. The waitress came to refil my drink and I watched her take it away and then she picked up another from another table to refill. I watched her the whole time. Now she refilled mine and gave it to the other person and the other persons with my drink. clearly mine still had lemonade and she filled it with either coke or tea and gave it to someone else and I got theirs. That was ill. I was speechless. My Orange chicken rice dish was super salty and that was just too bad I had to waste it. I came here on Sunday before our conference.  Maybe it was late at night and people don't care there but I wanted to throw up because I didn't watch her in a prior refill.
Karney V.,"Studio City, CA",98,309,2,4.0,7/8/2010,"Come here after volunteering at Someone Who Cares Soup Kitchen in Costa Mesa or the annual Alzheimer's Walk and I guarantee the food will taste twice as good, and a whole lot more satisfying.   Service was friendly but a little slow on a Saturday afternoon, but the chicken madeira was worth the wait.  Drinks were a little on the weak side, but heavy drinking Saturday afternoon kind of sends off the wrong impression, no?"
Gordon W.,"San Diego, CA",0,61,2,4.0,11/12/2012,"Enormous, gorgeous restaurant in the astonishingly overbuilt Newport Center / Fashion Island. HUGE menu. HUGE portions of food. Very comfortable setting, EXCEPT FOR THE NOISE!!! It's difficult to have a conversation because of the background noise. Pleasant staff, aside from our waitress obviously wanting us to vacate our table. Do you imagine that we don't notice that?"
Eric M.,"Savoonga, AK",9,844,434,3.0,8/4/2012,"Beets and Goat Cheese dish -- really?  Beets?  Where were they?  It was mostly lettuce and one-third a beet sliced up in little pieces and strewn about with even fewer pieces of cheese, topped with lettuce galore.  Our waiter was slow, as was his replacement who didn't keep drinks filled and had to be told many times ""no"" to her suggested dessert listings."
Paul A.,"Irvine, CA",700,105,63,4.0,4/25/2010,"I used to come to this Cheesecake Factory EVERY Friday night way back when I used to work down the street at Bandera. It's the only restaurant still serving food after 11pm and for that it gets 4 stars.  The good thing about late night dining, no wait...the bad? Even though there aren't that many occupied tables, the service seems to be on the slower side...I guess I can't fault them because I used to work in restaurants and knows what it's like after a busy night. There is one particular server, I don't know her name but she must be on speed or something because whenever I went and she was working, the service would be top notch. On to the food...if you've learned one thing from my other reviews, it should be that I am something of a creature of habit, I tend to order the same thing and rarely stray. At the Cheesecake Factory, I almost always start with the chopped salad as an appetizer (with Bleu Cheese dressing instead of the vinaigrette it comes with). This is my 2nd favorite restaurant salad (first being the Macho salad at Bandera). It must be the bacon and bleu cheese that makes it so awesome...it also has copped pieces of apple in it which I don't really care for but it contributes to the overall texture of the salad.  In addition to the salad, we'll usually get the artichoke & spinach dip...also very good, still not the best but good nonetheless. Having been here 1,000 times on Friday night, I can tell you that the special for Friday is always the same thing, it's never changed...it's been Mahi Mahi for as long as I've gone and that is what I get. You can get it simply grilled, blackened or Mediterranean style (on a bed of mashed potatoes). I've tried it all three ways but prefer it blacked with a side of mashed potatoes and broccoli or sauteed spinach. I have on the rare occasion strayed from these items, I've tried some of their burgers which were decent, nothing to write home about but filling and good. I had the fish tacos which were fine except for the fact that they put Mandarin Oranges on them...never seen that before, I pick them out because I forget that they come with them.  With the name Cheesecake Factory, it's safe to assume that their signature dessert item is...Cheesecake. They have quite the list and I've not tried them all. I like the Oreo or Godiva chocolate cheesecake which are both available year round but my ALL time favorite is the pumpkin cheesecake which is only available around Oct-Dec. Word to the wise, it sells out pretty fast too so get there early in the season (I learned this the hard way).  Overall, I like the Cheesecake factory because it's convenient and has a pretty eclectic menu...usually a wide selection results in poorer quality (don't know why, just how it is) but the quality is actually pretty good and the food is consistent between locations."
Reggie R.,"Newport Beach, CA",0,18,1,3.0,10/22/2012,"I've been here several times in the past couple months and the service and food is always hit or miss, granted, I usually go during the ""dinner rush."" The severs are always friendly even though a lot of times they seem to be helping way too many tables to really give us a great experience. During the busy times space can get a little cramped if you dont have a booth, but it's not too bad. The wait time during the weekends can get up to 45 min so plan ahead if you want a table by a certain time. Their Skinnylicious menu offers low calorie/low carb alternatives for those who are watching their figures. Of course, the cheese cake is always delicious!!!"
Dru C.,"Orange County, CA",658,833,2262,3.0,4/10/2009,"If you go to a Cheesecake Factory and your waiter speaks with a semi-fake half French and Italian accent, you've undoubtedly just entered the Twilight Zone. On a recent visit during lunch, our waiter was a poor man's version of Jean Phillipe, the maitre d' for Chef Ramsey in that show Hell's Kitchen.  He would use wild hand gestures to introduce and over-emphasize the specials, which was just fish and soup. He had a slight snooty attitude, but at the same time was very friendly. He even had the black, slicked-back oily hair. The only thing missing? Food with fancy names. So I decided to go with a semi-fancy name on the menu and ordered the Chicken Costoletta. To be honest, I had never heard of this term but when I read the description, it sounded vaguely familiar. Three large tender pieces of chicken, flattened with a meat mallet, lightly breaded, then fried to a crisp golden brown. When it was delivered, the waiter even said ""bon appetit."" On the side is a huge mound of mashed potatoes and several sprigs of grilled asparagus. What made the dish pop with flavor was the lemon-y citrus-infused sauce beneath the chicken. A few dips in that sauce, and everything just tasted... A-OK. The waiter provided good service, almost too nice. He even said ""my lady"" multiple times to the only woman at our table. Who gets addressed that way nowadays? Lady Guinevere, yes. Patrons at Cheesecake Factory? No."
JJ V.,"Newport Beach, CA",0,10,,5.0,1/24/2013,"We've been here many times, always good.  Only negative, there always seems to be a wait, especially Friday and Saturday evenings, but it's worth the wait. Parking is usually easy at Fashion Island."
Jennifer A.,"Valencia, CA",125,170,53,4.0,2/12/2010,"I had a major craving for some of their Small Bites last night. Cheesecake Factory, like any decent chain, gives you consistency. The food is always the same, so when I find something that I like I tend to crave it. I went, got a glass of wine (Raven's Head Zinfandel, I love it!) and a few small bites: -Fried Artichoke Hearts -Shrimp Scampi Crustini -Stuffed Dates -Beet Salad And yes, I ate it all... Fried Artichoke Hearts come with a tasty mayo dipping sauce. It's a breadcrumb type of breading, which I wasn't too keen on. It was kind of thick and the hearts were kind of small (yet the breading doubled their size). -1/2 star Shrimp Scampi Crustini had an amazing sauce, I loved the toast it came with. But the actual shrimp, not so much. They were kind of tough, but the sauce more than made up for it (I wish I could have a whole bowl of that sauce and the toast!). -1/2 star Stuffed Dates were AWESOME. My favorite thing all night. Next time I'll probably just get two servings of this, a small salad, and call it a day! They were gooey yet firm. Not too salty and not too sweet. Yum yum. Beet Salad is always good. Well, I'm a huge fan of beet salads, so I'd like this no matter what it came with. Not a huge fan of the microgreens it's served with, but they have huge chunks of beet and lots of tasty goat cheese, so I suffer through my green veg. Service was pretty spot on. I think my server either went on a break or started training someone, because partway through she introduced some other server and told me they would both be helping me out. Whatever it was, it worked out fine. I'm a pretty low-maintience customer anyway, but my courses (I got two small plates first, followed by two more) were timed perfectly, and my server(s) were annoying or anything. The main server I had was Kim, and she was funny and helpful. I even heard her with her other tables and she had such a bubbly and fun personality. I would totally go again and ask to be put in her section. Parking can be kind of annoying, and I hate driving to Fashion Island, but this is the closest Cheesecake Factory to my house, and I am VERY happy that it treated me so well last night. :) PS: Chicken Picatta is tasty too, just didn't want an entree last night."
