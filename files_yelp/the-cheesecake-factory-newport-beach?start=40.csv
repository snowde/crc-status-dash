Laura W.,"Reseda, Los Angeles, CA",182,8,,1.0,12/13/2017,ive been waiting for over an hour and apparently the girls in the front that just sit and chat all evening didn't put my name down. the manager didn't even care. horrible service very unsatisfied. ***christy the waitress is the best though. she was the only highlight of this place.
Gretchen L.,"Las Vegas, NV",155,73,15,1.0,9/16/2017,"Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite restaurants, and I've never been disappointed in one meal. Today I was not happy considering I usually order the herb crusted salmon. Today my fish tasted old and way too fishy. On top of that my boyfriends side of fruit were all old and withered. This Cheesecake Factory needs to get it together and throw out some old food. For the price we pay and quality of food and service I come here for, the food should be the least of my worries."
Jaime W.,"Tustin, CA",64,147,405,1.0,3/27/2017,"Seriously, what happened here? I've had bad service but never bad food from Cheesecake Factory until Sunday. I eat here frequently because I work close by and I've never had a bad meal, I would typically hold off on a bad review for one bad meal but this was exceptionally bad. My husband and I ordered the Chicken Salad Sandwich to split, which is a pretty common order for us, and it was horrible. The sandwich was all bread and mayo, tons and tons of mayo, very greasy too - where is the chicken? There was hardly any chicken in the chicken salad - I think I had two pieces of chicken surrounded by clumps of mayo. We would have sent it back but our waitress vanished and we were starving. It was a total rip off, we were planning on ordering cheesecake after but the sandwich was so bad we just wanted to leave."
Genesis F.,"Long Beach, CA",141,70,128,2.0,9/16/2017,"Their food is good, but poor service. Our server forgot to put in my order and my girls were practically done with their food before I even received mine. I am honestly still waiting and my girls are almost done which is why I am writing this now lol All I ordered was an appetizer Buffalo Blasts. The reason I know my server forgot my order is cause he actually walked over and said "" Are you ready for cheesecake?"" And I hadn't even gotten my food yet..I was like, ""Ummm, my buffalo blasts?"" And he said, "" Oh! Let me check on that."" When he came back he said, ""They had to make it fresh so that's why it's taking so long, like 8 more minutes?"" The only reason I said yes is cause I have been craving it for about 2 weeks AND I am 37 weeks pregnant. Not an excuse, but still. I think he could have done better, but maybe cause it was busy? Not sure. Anyways, His name is Tyson. The buffalo blasts were good when they finally came. Had to take half to go. Won't be back for awhile, like a long while."
Emily J.,"Orange County, CA",193,480,1695,5.0,3/4/2016,"Impromptu lunch at The Cheesecake Factory.  No wait on Friday at noon!  And surprisingly, we found a parking space quickly too. Our waitress was fantastic - nice, super friendly and chatty.  She was also attentive throughout the meal; filled our water glasses several times. I ordered the Almond Crusted Salmon Salad.  I think it's fairly new, but then again I haven't been here in months!  Unfortunately, there is no lunch portion of that particular salad.  The salmon was tender and beautifully cooked, and well seasoned.  The almonds added a nice crunch to the salmon.  The salad consisted of kale, arugula, Brussels sprouts, quinoa, avocado and dried cranberries, with a vinaigrette dressing.  It went well with the salmon, and I was very pleased with my selection. Great dining experience today, and at $14.95 I thought it was a good deal too."
Alex Q.,"Temecula, CA",241,15,,5.0,6/28/2017,"My girlfriend and I stopped by last night for dinner to celebrae her birthday, and wow! Our server was an older lady, Christy, man she made our night!! We were having a long  and sortve rough day, and cheesecake factory was the only few places open around the area so we decided to stop by. Cheisty really made our day!! She was beyond helpfull, very prompt/attentive and overall very sweet!! We will definitely be returning here, and hopefully we can have her as our server again!!"
Erika B.,"La Mirada, CA",277,16,3,1.0,3/16/2017,"I've been to a lot of cheesecake factories and this is by far the worst. Last night we went and put our name in for two. We were waiting for 20 minutes and noticed that new people were walking in and getting seated before us. So we asked if our name was coming up and the hostess informed us that oops, she never put it in. Wow.  We contemplated leaving but we stuck it out. We thought maybe she'd bump our name up or something but NO, she continued to seat a bunch of people as we waited there while she copped an attitude as if it was our fault. Finally, we sat down and ate. Food was whatever.  We get home a couple hours later and my boyfriend starts barfing. And I got sick as well. I should've left when they screwed up the first time. We definitely won't be returning here."
Bill L.,"Newport Beach, CA",0,7,,2.0,9/29/2017,"What happened to the Cheesecake Factory?  Now I know why they are never busy like they used to be. The food has gone downhill. Just ordered Chicken Madera  to go and it was so dry. Not only was there no noticeable sauce dripped over the food, but the chicken tasted dry and had just a hint of the Madera sauce flavor. Portion size was ok,  but the quality was terrible.  Are you listening, managers?"
Mackenzie S.,"Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, CA",58,2,,1.0,5/6/2017,"I've been a fan of the Cheesecake Factory for a long time, but I had such a bad experience here that I don't think I'll be returning to any CF for a long time. I'll be honest: I have to eat below 25g net carbs per day, which means dish modifications are basically a way of life when I go out to eat. After finding nutritional information online, I thought I had some great menu options that, with a few modifications, would fit my diet. Exciting! I settled on the Skinnylicious Steak Medallions, which normally come with mashed potatoes, wine sauce, crushed croutons, asparagus, and mushrooms. I asked for the dish without croutons, potatoes, and the sauce (all high carb, though I would've loved to eat them!), and I asked to swap another side - sautéed spinach - for my potatoes. I ordered the medallions medium-rare.  I wish I'd taken a picture to show you how my dish arrived, because it was honestly unbelievable that ANY restaurant would let a dish like that out of the kitchen. The five medallions were the size of quarters and so over-cooked that I could hardly chew them. Spinach was haphazardly thrown all over the plate, and the other sides were missing. Even when I asked for them to be brought out, they were quickly sautéed and thrown on the plate the same way. I got a pretty clear impression of the chef's thoughts on my orders - I was another bitchy customer ruining a recipe, and I didn't deserve the effort it took to put together a nice dish. Look, I know modifications are annoying. If I could find even a single restaurant that made dishes I could eat without any special requests, I would eat there every day of my life and never bother anyone else with my ""high maintenance"" diet. But man, how can any respectable establishment put out a dish like that? I would've rather skipped a meal altogether and stayed in my room than spend as much money as I did on such a sad meal. I'm still pretty upset about it, tbh.  TLDR; if you have a dietary restriction, look elsewhere for a restaurant that will actually respect your requests and still make you a dish that's not total garbage."
Laura S.,"Irvine, CA",3,103,258,4.0,5/5/2017,"The food and service over the years has been consistently good. On a recent visit, I had the shrimp summer rolls and a mojito. The rolls were good with veggies, rice noodles,.. and my favorite part was the sauces. Spicy chili and peanut sauce. If I had more time to eat, I would have ordered thai lettuce wraps. It's a big platter of food that never leaves me feeling like I just ate a ""big platter of food""! It's great, as well as the grilled salmon, chicken madeira, and, oh I better stop. The menu is so large, I can go on and on."
Annie R.,"Costa Mesa, CA",2,45,21,4.0,5/15/2017,"Honestly, for the price and amount of food they give you, you can't beat this place! The portions are huge and they have servers who have been serving there for years! I like it a lot! The only reason o didn't give it a five star is because of the long waits."
Skitter H.,"Irvine, CA",0,10,,2.0,5/14/2017,Ordered to go - 3 orders of Shrimps  Angle hair.  Over cooked shrimps - they were tough. Under cocked pasta grumped at the end part.  Very bland. I tried this location thinking it would be as good as the one in Woodland Hills.
Brady R.,"Dana Point, CA",6,64,9,5.0,9/11/2017,Absolutely spectacular location and wonderful shops around in the restaurant there was a 20 minute wait which was 20 minutes we were seated at table was clean the service was fast and friendly and the food was delicious and our waitress did a little something special for us on Saturday night for my girlfriend's birthday I can I have been more pleased with this night will definitely be back
Lauren V.,"Austin, TX",200,123,34,4.0,6/11/2016,"I've come here numerous times but never reviewed, so I will do an overview.  Service: I always have received very good service at this location.  The wait never seems to be too long, server comes to the table promptly.  And who doesn't love the cheesecake factory bread! I mean, right?   Food: For Lunch I like the Renee Special.  It is a ton of food, I can never even finish it.  It comes with a cup (the size of a bowl) of the soup of the day.  Today it was loaded baked potato.  This was so good, had bits of bacon, cheese and sour cream on top, awesome flavor. It also comes with a half sandwich (the portion is more like a whole sandwich), there are two choices, a turkey one and chicken salad sandwich.  The chicken salad sandwich is what I choose.  It comes with a side salad as well.  For $11.95 the price is right. For dinner I tend to go with the Crusted Chicken Romano.  I have been ordering this dish from the Cheesecake Factory for years now.  It is so tasty and you will have leftovers. It is a lightly breaded chicken served with a side of pasta.  The flavors are just right. Dessert: Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake is always my first choice.  They have a crazy long list of cheesecakes to choose from.  I've had a few but, I am a chocolate lover and always go back to this.   They have a new skinny menu with lots of low cal options.  I haven't had anything off this menu but I like the options.  The menu in general is very large and it can be difficult to choose, but nothing I have had here has been terrible."
Brody P.,"Huntington Beach, CA",38,78,74,1.0,1/29/2017,"This is the 3rd time in a row that I came here (this time just for dessert to go) where the front lobby smells like dirty mop water and the bathroom (men's) smelled like cigarette smoke. Once, okay, twice, maybe, but three times... come on!  I'm not going back. I can't. It really smells bad. I'm a fan of the place too. The one at The Irvine Spectrum is always fine. It's just a longer drive for me."
Mc M.,"Newport Beach, CA",11,35,47,1.0,4/23/2017,"We come to this location quite often and enjoy  the entrees and service. But yesterday we dropped by for dinner and were RUDELY served by Hailey. Yet Another waitress who obviously hates her job but needs a paycheck.  She didn't check on us until we were done with our meals, just kept walking right passed us to help the bigger party by us. We needed a few things but we powered through our meal because we were hungry."
Victor D.,"San Jose, CA",0,160,,4.0,3/26/2017,The view from the restaurant is nice.  Service is alright and not up to standards. The quality of food and cocktails are consistent with others
Aaron E.,"Orange County, CA",94,1429,2127,3.0,10/4/2015,"This Cheesecake Factory is just like yours except it boasts a view of the Pacific Ocean.  Ahhh, The Cheesecake Factory... no mall is complete without one, right? This location will not disappoint true fans as it features an extensive menu of various items dreamed up in a test kitchen with flavor profiles that will not scare old white people or children. The service is professional grade for the most part and comes with unlimited rented smiles both tableside and at the bar.  This franchise clearly believes in the jack-of-all-trades-master-of-none approach as proven by the colossal menu featuring everything from Miso Salmon to Chicken & Biscuits, Calabrian Pizza, Carppacio, a Baltimore inspired Pit Dip Sandwich... You get the idea. I was a little surprised there were no Korean Barbecue influenced options, Banh Mi sandwiches or Macarons as all are the ""it"" items of test kitchens worldwide in 2015. Maybe next year? Then of course there is the 30 foot glass case worth of Cheesecake options, the perennial favorite of every suburban mother. Life doesn't get better than this.  Snark aside, The Cheesecake Factory is fine for what it is so long as your expectations are tempered and realistic. They are nothing if not consistent and you can do a hell of a lot worse (NORM'S in Bellflower). I tend to stick to the bar when I need to kill time prior to a haircut at Tone & Guy or after hitting Brooks Brothers and for that it does an admirable job."
Sebastian S.,"Newport Beach, CA",70,93,70,5.0,12/27/2016,"Out of every single restaurant I've been to around the world, Cheesecake Factory always remains as my go to place that I have to go to at least once a month. This is the first place I take anyone from outside the US that visits me and they always love it.  Many say CF is way overrated and that it has more items on its menu than it can handle. You either love it or hate it. But honestly, I'm in love with this place and have yet to try something on the menu that I didn't like. And of course, cheesecake being my favourite dessert makes this place heaven! Haven't found any other place that serves cheesecakes as good as this.  So the happy hour here is out of this world! There's heaps of different appetisers to chose from at super good prices along with discounted drinks. It's usually between 4-6 M-F and it's totally worth it. My go to appetisers are the avocado egg rolls and the factory nachos! Both of them are AMAZING!! Love how on the nachos, the chips are baked which really makes a difference in taste. I've also had the sliders and the buffalo blasts both of which are excellent as well!  If I come outside of the happy hour, I tend to get a burger or a sandwich but I've tried a good chunk of other items on the menu and they're honestly all really good. Basically anything you get, unless its on the skinny menu, is going to come in a ginormous portion so be prepared to take food home. You really can't go wrong with anything you pick.  And then there's the cheesecakes. The gorgeous, decadent, mouth-watering cheesecakes. Whether you like the food or not, everyone has to agree that the cheesecakes here are to die for and that no where else makes them as good as CF. For starters, they're just beautiful to look at. The presentation of every cheesecake is amazing and the taste is just as good. Every bite takes you to heaven. Yes, it's that good. My personal favourites are the Godiva (you really have to love chocolate for this one) , S'mores, Oreo and red velvet. I will say that the only one I can't recommend is the Chocolate chip cookie dough. Not as good as it seems. Otherwise, you can't go wrong. Don't like cheesecake? Try the Godiva brownie sundae. Thank me later :)  In regards to this specific location in Newport, haven't had any problems. Service has always been great for me and I can't wait to be back!"
Maxine E.,"Simi Valley, CA",73,45,30,5.0,5/7/2017,"Yesterday, I brought my mom in for an early Mother's Day lunch. We had the most amazing server, but I didn't get her name.  The service, food and the extra mile our server went to make it a special lunch will not be forgotten. I appreciate it so much.  Thank you!!! Maxine Evans"
