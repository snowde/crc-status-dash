Shane M.,"Costa Mesa, CA",0,2,,5.0,6/4/2014,"Love love love this place, especially for special occasions. But a little too popular for my taste. Cheesecake is absolutely FOR my taste though. And awesome team of staff"
Stephanie S.,"Orange, CA",2,34,1,5.0,8/8/2011,"Perfection!  The food is always amazing, and they give you plenty, so you always have some to take home.  The only problem is deciding which flavor of cheesecake to have, every flavor is more delicious than the next."
Laura S.,"Pismo Beach, CA",0,29,,3.0,7/14/2012,"Had the chicken marsala today.  Have to day it was disappointing.  Probably amoung the worst I've had.  Portion was very generous in true cheesecake factory style, but the flavor was weak, and the pile of bow tie pasta was unappealing.  Service was good, and I know this to be a great resteraunt with great food otherwise.  The reeces peanut butter cheesecake was awesome!"
Mike F.,"Newport Beach, CA",22,25,10,4.0,3/8/2012,I've been going to this restaurant for years and I am always impressed with their service. The food is really good as well. I like the fact that they added a healthier menu. I just wish they had drink specials.
Tiffany D.,"Santa Ana, CA",2,26,,5.0,6/8/2009,"When i walked in i was like.... ""whoa this place is fancy!!"" I'm used to casual places, but then i saw all the people in flip flops, cargo shorts, torn shirts, and hats and i was like..."" ooooooookkkkkkkkaaaaaayyy"". Not too excited anymore. Then our waitress Sarah blew me away!!! She was so nice and helpful, cuz it was me and my husbands first time eating there. She had great suggestions and was extremely patient. I ordered Chicken Dumplings for an appetizer. Yummy yumm. My husband had the Pasta Da Vinci. It looked wierd cuz it had a dark sauce and covered in mushrooms (which i HATE), but he loved it! Ate everything. I ordered the Parmesean Crusted Chicken with noodles and it was the BEST thing i had ever tried!!! the portions are HUGE and fairly priced. It was my husbands birthday so i thought they would give us a discount on his cheesecake... but no. They did decorate the plate really pretty though, and they sang for us.  This location is really really nice, but VERY NOISY!!! If you want to have a romantic date, i don't think this is it. Way too much going on all the time. But the food is outstanding."
Chris P.,"Newport Beach, CA",5,13,,1.0,6/21/2012,"Been there twice, but only ate once! My first visit was an OK experience and we decided to give them another chance - I do LOVE cheesecake! On second visit we were seated by a friendly and chatty hostess. Then we sat, and we sat.........and we sat. We were chatting for 15 minutes and realised that we had not been approached by a server. We were not in a corner, there were a bunch of staff passing by us so we both tried to catch a waiter's eye for another 5 minutes. They were not slammed, they were reasonably busy but really not rushed off their feet. We decided to give them a few more minutes and ultimately decided to walk out. Not something I have done too often. Whilst I'm perfectly capable of getting up from my seat and approaching a waiter and asking for service, I don't think I should have to fight for attention in a restaurant. We did explain our exit to the hostess and she looked very embarrassed. The upside was that we walked into Great Maple just around the corner and had an excellent experience there."
Ted D.,"Newport Beach, CA",274,325,420,4.0,5/10/2009,"I haven't been back for a while, but this place has always been dependable with their food and drinks, let alone them cheesecakes!! Unfortunately, last I checked my fav was discontinued, boston cream cheesecake!! I guess my palate doesn't represent the pulse of america!! They have a huge menu with a wide variety of regional dishes, so if your not sure what kind of food you're in the mood for, they got you covered. I'm not a huge fan of chain restaurants, but I make an exception for this one."
Sean B.,"Huntington Beach, CA",348,50,4,4.0,12/23/2009,"It was a busy lunch time in there today, but the service didn't suffer a bit.  I had a ""small"" Chicken Ceaser salad which was HUGE, but very tasty.  I ended up taking half of it home with me.   Great view also!"
Sharon C.,"Irvine, CA",114,175,,4.0,11/19/2008,"BIGGER, PRETTIER, BADDER version of your average Cheesecake Factory. And by ""badder"", I mean better. That is all."
Casey N.,"Newport Beach, CA",158,28,,4.0,2/5/2014,I tend to go here often because they are one of the few places that are open later in this area...I have had both good and bad experiences here but most recently had great service from Joe later at night...the pasta trends to be under seasoned but the Vietnamese shrimp summer rolls are my favorite and always great
Robert C.,"Riverside, CA",223,307,15,4.0,11/15/2008,"Came here yesterday with a group of friends after watching Quantum of Solace over at Big Newport. Service, especially at 9pm at night was really good - the Host was seriously cool and chill, the service was really quick, really relaxing, and really good, because we never really had to wait for them. Couple that with pretty decent grub in some pretty good sizes at really decent prices to make for some great post movie late night dinner grubbing. So overall that's 3.5 stars (since the food while good is never anything to write home about). The extra star? The layout and look of this place. It has to be the fanciest looking Cheesecake factory I've ever seen. So if you're looking for pretty good food to satisfy a diverse group of appetites and food allergies, you can't go wrong here."
Natalie M.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,4,,2.0,12/1/2012,"I went there yesterday with two people. It was a busy Friday night, we went in at about 7:15. The hostess said it would be about a 30 minute wait - totally fine. It was busy. She gave us a pager and after 20 minutes, the pager went off. We gave her the pager and she asked us to stand in line behind a few other customers and assured us that a hostess would seat us in a minute. Someone else turned in their pager and got in line behind us as well. It was a good five minutes before a hostess came back and sat the people that got in line BEHIND us. I work in customer service and HATE crabby people that don't understand the nature of the business and that we literally do everything in our power to make the customer happy. BUT, to seat someone that got there after us (with the same number of people in their party as us - 3 people) is pretty ridiculous. Not to mention, we waited in line for another six or seven minutes until finally being called. WHY BUZZ THE PAGER IF YOU'RE NOT GOING TO SEAT ME RIGHT AWAY?????  If you buzz the pager, we think we are about to get sat, so that is a lame system that you have there Cheesecake Factory! The server was very sweet, she passed us three times telling us she would be with us in a minute. No problem, I'm glad she acknowledged us and didn't just leave us to sit there waiting and wondering where our sever was. She took our drink orders and entree orders. I ordered a salad to start. My salad came AFTER we all got our entrees.  The bread is always awesome!!  The entrees (I had the BBQ burger), however, are bland. Poor service, and okay food for high prices - I won't be back."
Mark S.,"Irvine, CA",86,31,3,4.0,4/7/2012,"I don't know why, but this Cheesecake Factory tends to be better than the other ones i've eaten out.  Yes this is a chain restaurant with a menu that has pretty much EVERYTHING.  If you want mom and pop, don't go here, that's not who they are.  If you want a solid b to b+ meal, go here.  I love their turkey club sandwich.  I have no idea why it's so delicious, but it just is, I accept that fact!  People are always nice, it's clean, but can get pretty packed."
Danielle A.,"Newport Beach, CA",60,92,8,5.0,12/6/2010,"There's something for anyone on this menu, it's lengthy.  Great place to share food.  Delicious and large portions.  Come hungry or ready to leave with food.  And make room for desserts... so many to choose from it can be dizzying."
Shun H.,"Santa Ana, CA",2,25,10,4.0,3/22/2010,"im not a huge fan of Cheesecake Factory, but i like this location.  its great during happy hour (4-6?) and you can see great sunset view from the windows seat! i loved the scene.  i believe their food is average.  a couple weeks ago i had Ahi Tartare (also called Ahi Carpaccio) and Tiramisu Cheesecake. the tartare was very tasty even though it was small portion. it came with avocado and sweet wasabi sauce. since i love tiramisu so much i had to try tiramisu cheesecake! it was good too.  it wasnt great meal, but pretty decent."
Alex C.,"La Puente, CA",32,69,30,3.0,7/14/2009,"Very disappointed in the dining experience this time at a Cheesecake Factory.  This was a Saturday evening so we expected a crowd/wait. Our wait was about 30 minutes... pretty much on the dot. But it was somewhat of a surprise mind you that the rest of the center (Fashion Island) was dead... on a Saturday evening... by time we were finished with our dinner, exited the restaurant, all the shops were closed! This would have been about 8:30 PM. Economic Crises I guess? Even for Costa Mesa?  So were were seated, hostess was nice, few moments went by after looking over the menu (We're Cheesecake Factory veterans, so we know pretty much what they serve, what we like, love, and have been meaning to try) Blonde server came by, took our drinks, needed another moment still to look over the menu (nothing sounded appetizing!) And yeah, I can usually tell when service is going to be one of those... she just wasn't into us maybe.  So I ordered fettuccine alfredo with sun-dried tomato, with green salad, dressing on the side, no beets! (That's just weird) My wife ordered the beer batter fish with green salad, dressing on the side.  Salads came out, dressings on the side... not enough dressing for the stupid huge salad, next time we'll have them toss it in. En tress came out, mine looked very good; I ended up finding an appetite for pasta. My wife's fish came out. Looked good (Always a fav.) Server didn't bring ketchup for fries, malt vinegar, and the kitchen didn't put any tarter sauce on the plate.  So she asked for all three... Well that seemed like such a chore for her. Ended up bring the tarter sauce, malt vinegar, no ketchup. Asked again, she looked at us like we were bothering her.  Well, fettucinni was a little too dente... I think even for al dente it was hard, no taste whatsoever, (as Jason Y commented!) chicken was tough (Cheesecake's chicken breast usually is too, no matter when we've been). Got the most flavor from the damn sun-dried tomato's)  Wife's fish was plain as plain goes, even the coleslaw was coles-blah!  We ended up eating about half of our en tress (Server never came by again until my white sauce was near curdled eww) When she finally came by, she took our plates. I was expecting her to notice our pretty full plates and ask if we enjoyed our meals or not. I think a good server would have noticed. I ended up telling her everything was flavorless. She offered to have the manager come over. I declined, she insisted... I knew what that meant....  ... Free Cheesecakes! ;D  sorry for the long rant. ...oh... why are Cheesecake Factorys always so damn loud?"
Jen C.,"Fountain Valley, CA",25,8,1,4.0,6/26/2012,Reasonable price for ocean view and good ambiance. Angel hair pasta is my favorite. Of course you can't leave without trying their cheese cake. It's not your fine dining of Newport but a great place to hang out with friends/families and some dates.
Janel P.,"Pasadena, CA",52,193,13,2.0,7/4/2009,"So salty!! I left full, but the food wasn't great. My family tried a variety on the menu and none of us were wowed. Service was alright, but not great too.  Sill love the cheesecake though, it's perfect for sharing."
Patrick A.,"Covina, CA",6,153,2,5.0,9/22/2011,"Came here after my wedding and was treated like guests by our server Chris. He was courteous and made sure we had all that we needed We were seated rather quickly for having a group of 10 and the whole time there our server would crack jokes here and there. I even got a free slice of their chocolate cake which tasted amazing. Prices are quite high, however if good service and food are involved, then I don't mind."
Christina K.,"Yorba Linda, CA",119,211,5,4.0,11/6/2008,"If you sit by the bar, you can see the ocean which already makes this Cheesecake Factory better than the others. I was surprised to learn that they offer breakfast here, which I knew would probably be a GIANT fattening plate of some fusion flavors like their usual lunch/dinner plates.  I came here for Sunday Brunch, and happy to see that there was no wait. The service is decent and the decor is like every other Cheesecake factory. I got the Baja Chicken hash which had chicken, veggies, potatoes, and some tasty sauce on top of two crispy tortillas. Ooh, and poached eggs on top. It was amazing, and I probably consumed 3000 calories in one sitting. My bf got the breakfast burrito which was GINORMOUS and i was surprised to see him finish the whole thing. FYI, you have to ask for the bread when you order breakfast."
