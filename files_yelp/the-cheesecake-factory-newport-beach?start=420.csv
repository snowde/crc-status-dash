Allison M.,"Seattle, WA",82,350,36,4.0,5/26/2009,"I personally do not like cheesecake which is why I had such negative feelings about this place to begin with. The first few times I came here, I stuck to the chicken lettuce wraps as I didn't believe there would be anything better.   After years of not having gone here, a friend convinced me to go one night and we ordered Chicken Piccata and Pasta da Vinci.  Those dishes do not disappoint.  The Chicken Piccata has a creamy lemon sauce topped with capers and served with angel hair-a perfect combo. The Pasta da Vinci is perfect for those who love the Madeira flavor. Since then, this place has got me coming back and always for something different.  They used to have a spaghetti w/ pesto but for some reason, it is no longer available.  That was one of my favorites. Crusted Chicken Romano is very good if you're craving that rich crispy parmesan flavor.  Can't forget about the appetizers: 1. Ahi Carpaccio-pricey for the amount you get but definitely worht it. 2. Salmon firecracker rolls-a definite must-have if you're craving something bursting with flavor and spicy-ness 3.  Stuffed Mushrooms-it has the Madeira wine flavor and is bursting with goodness! 4. Fried Macaroni Cheese Balls-not one of my favorites but it is pretty good if you're craving some greasy junk food. Top salad: Santa Fe Salad--may i add, it may as well be a meal for two! Top Drinks: Georgia Peach and Pomegranate Mojito....actually, all their drinks are pretty good! I can always count on Cheesecake Factory for variety and their wait staff at the Fashion Island Location is particularly friendly. I prefer to come here vs. Irvine Spectrum for that reason. Oh and also b/c you can see the beach from the rear window. Beware of large portions and be prepared to share!"
Max S.,"Newport Coast, CA",6,7,3,5.0,12/23/2013,"I am a regular here! The staff is very skilled and always makes me feel at home. I've loved every dish I've ever tried here but my favorites are the crusted chicken Romano, Caesar salad, avocado egg rolls, chicken pot stickers, and the spinach cheese dip! Definitely a must go"
Elizabeth S.,"Los Angeles, CA",97,58,,1.0,8/14/2008,"This one is for the Fashion Island store.  My boyfriend and I stopped in here to grab dinner recently. We shared guacamole as an app, I ate the salmon rolls for my dinner, and he got some monstrosity of a hamburger.  He woke up with a horrific case of food poisoning so severe I had to take him to Hoag. (The burger was definitely the culprit, too; he hadn't eaten anything else the entire day.) After several days of writhing in pain, missing work, and missing the 4th of July (thanks Cheesecake Factory) he called them to let them know what happened. To compensate for this awful experience and nearly $300 in hospital bills they sent us a $20 gift card in the mail.  If you know what's good for you, steer clear of this icky place."
Angela G.,"Santa Rosa, CA",218,99,174,2.0,9/22/2008,A Typical cheesecake restaurant which is fail safe good. The location is well know for it's upscale shopping center(fashion island of OC). The food is great as usual (except for the surprising amount of prior reviewers experiences). The customer services has been sub par if not horrible 75% of the time. When you check in always verify the aprox. waiting time because their paging system rarely works (it's failed to function on three visits). The waiter tends to either forget what you want or just about your group all together. On two occasions I've had to ask for the bill several times over a 10-15 min span (add another ten to get it back to sign!). To the point of considering walking out if they were that inconvenienced to give us the bill requested.  The Cheesecake factory at Irvine Spectrum Center is now the only local cheesecake factory we go. The Service is exceptional in comparision.
David P.,"Anaheim, CA",11,104,42,4.0,5/19/2011,Had the best waitress we've ever had in this restaurant.  Excellent smiles and genuine warmth. The food is always delicious.  Our favorite cheesecake you MUST try: Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake.  It's a glimpse of heaven.
Glenn Z.,"Orange, CA",19,215,28,5.0,1/5/2010,They serve everything. But my wife love the Thai lettuce wraps and I love the Burgers. The last time I ate there they accidentally gave my burger so the wrong customer. They were extremely apologetic. They could have just hidden the error but instead made it right by not charging for my burger and also provided me with a complementary bowl of soup and extra order of fries.
Tiffany B.,"Clayton, MO",10,45,19,4.0,5/19/2013,I love the cheesecake but the food has a lot of calories.. It's a love/hate relationship
Jason H.,"Irvine, CA",26,16,,5.0,4/20/2010,"Even if the other dishes gave me the runs or brought me into a seizure (which, of course, they didn't), I'd still give Cheesecake Factory 5 stars on their Avocado Eggrolls alone. Gotta love that sauce that comes with them!"
Yui S.,"Costa Mesa, CA",10,161,1,5.0,6/16/2008,"This is the best Cheesecake Factory I have tried out of the ones I visited in Brea, Irvine, Huntington Beach, Riverside, etc.  It's the BEST one yet! I always come here to enjoy a salad and sometimes the soup.  If I'm not too full, I enjoy a dessert.  My BFF likes the Kobe Burger with fries and an order of Iced Tea. First off, the wait at this place isn't very long.  Even when it is busy during mid afternoon on a Saturday or Sunday, the longest we have waited for a table was about 10mins.  Other times, on weekday nights, we always get seated right away. Service is very good.  They usually come take our order right away, busy or not, and our food comes out about 15-20 mins. after we sit down.  I usually order the Chinese Chicken Salad when I go to Cheesecake Factory.  The salad stands up above all the other Chinese Chicken Salad at other Cheesecake Factory because the chicken is never dry here, presentation is beautiful, they give a lot more salad, the waiters and chefs can follow directions and pay special attention to requests (I always want my salad dry with dressing on side--no sprouts and green onions and substitute with eggs and corn..yes, I am picky). I can't personally speak for my BFF and his Kobe Burger, but he seems like enjoy it each time we go.  I believe he gets it a little pink and I've never heard him complain about how the burger is too dry.  The burger seems like a great portion for the price and many times, he doesn't even finish his burger and need to wrap it to-go. The servers are constantly refilling out drinks!  And always comes back to check up on us, making sure we are doinng alright. Desserts are delicious!  Their strawberry short cake was pretty good-- it is basically a globlet of FRESH strawberry (they were in season) with Vanilla Icecream and instead of using short bread, they use more of a wafer cookie (they put 2 large ones) topped with whipped cream and drizzled in strawberry sauce.  Yum!! The Kahlua cheesecake is also good.  I'm not a big fan of cheesecake, but I love the coffeebean smell they have when they use Kahlua to bake with the cheesecake.  Get it A La Mode! One warning about this place.  If you go on a weekend and it looks really packed,  make sure to request for a booth if there are only 2 of you guys.  If you don't mention it, they will place you in between two other small tables and you will have no room to move or even place your handbags.  It's really uncomfortable.. other than that, I love this place!  I come here at least once a week and am never disappointed!"
Susan D.,"Irvine, CA",0,226,,5.0,7/31/2013,"Presentation is impressive and consistently good.  We've been dining here for years   I have never been disappointed no matter what I order. My go to favorite place  any time . During holidays when most restaurants are closed for business, Cheesecake. Factory  is open  to please  diners. Thank you.  Service and  food always great. Cheesecake Factory  and Lawry's In Beverly Hills always  top choice for visiting family and friends ."
Shareen S.,"Boston, MA",79,32,3,4.0,5/27/2009,Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake...need I say more? Mmm mmm.
Alicia L.,"Coto de Caza, CA",279,205,,3.0,4/17/2008,"I have to say, I don't really get this place either.  But my issues are a little backwards  First problem, the menu makes me dizzy.  There are full-color ads sprinkled throughout, and so much information crammed into one page.  I cannot deal with all these menu items all helter-skelter through this binder they call a menu.  It makes my eyes go all wonky.  Also, their portions, even for lunch (""small salad"" my [blank]), are ridiculously huge.  To the point of absurdity.  It just seems like a monumental waste in alot of ways.  And then I have to carry leftovers around the mall or feel guilty for throwing most of it away. And I'm sorry, but the food has never really done it for me.  There are plenty of things I think are ""fine"" but nothing that would march me across Fashion Island just to have it.   It seems like most items fall just short of interest for me.  Something looks allllmost good...but not quite.  Maybe it's just my wonky eyes. Service is fine, hit-miss.  The lunch wait can get pretty ridiculous.  But it's good if you want to satisfy a diverse group, since the menu is so extensive and diverse. Not even tasty, delicious, awesome cheesecake can redeem you, Cheesecake Factory!  Maybe if next time I just get cheesecake, it'll be more like a four-star afternoon."
Don T.,"Santa Ana, CA",26,46,,2.0,4/20/2007,"I think this place is overrated.... Food's ok, got good dessert but the wait is GInormous. We had to wait 45 minutes JUST to get the buzzer... then we had to wait again for the buzzer to go off so we can sit at our table.  I got some burger with the fries. It was ok, the patty was big and they gave alot of fries. Other than that i wasn't too impressed. I guess i could have chosen something better but i didn't feel like spending much. The steaks are good though. Only thing better than other places hear are, you guessed it, they cheesecakes and dessert. Lotta variety to choose from. In my opinion theres other places to go thats better if there is an hour long wait."
Ashley W.,"Walnut, CA",85,143,97,4.0,10/14/2008,"*Food is decent.  *BIG portions, fair price. *GREAT SELECTION OF FOOD! *There's always something for someone in that 200+ menu (hopefully). *Desserts are a wonderful treat! It never fails to satisfy my sugar cravings. (Especially the Strawberry shortcake!) Don't splurge on it though... I didn't say it was fat-free.  *Service is friendly and helpful (I don't know busy hours though). *Opens until 11:00 pm.  I would have given it three stars if it weren't for the fact that the desserts have impaired my judgment."
TRICIA T.,"Irvine, CA",3,44,,4.0,2/17/2008,The Cheesecake routine: -- Wheat Bread (only -- don't even BOTHER with the white) -- Good butter for this kind of restaurant -- Dinner Salad -- Miso Salmon -- find someone to split it with.  It is great. -- Dessert optional It is worth the gas to get to a CF to get the Miso Salmon.
Peggy B.,"Laguna Woods, CA",0,2,,2.0,8/13/2013,"Always enjoy happy hour at various ccf and had a nice experience here. However, the restroom was one of the nastiest I've seen anywhere including dive bars, gas stations,etc.  I hope the kitchen is cleaner."
Amy K.,"Irvine, CA",595,754,1040,3.0,10/8/2007,"The first time I ate at a Cheesecake Factory about 12 years ago, it was at this location in Fashion Island.  I came for lunch and sat in the bar area, and I was blown away by the view of the ocean out the window. Fast forward to last Saturday, and while the view is still spectacular during the day, I'm not nearly as impressed with the food. We started with the Thai Lettuce Wraps, which is probably one of the best items on the extensive menu.  No complaints here. For my entree, I had the shrimp and crab salad, which is CF's version of a Louie salad.  The seafood was good, but the whole thing was smothered in Thousand Island dressing, so after a while I felt like all I was eating was dressing on hearts of romaine with some under ripe slices of Roma tomatoes.  I definitely couldn't taste the crab under all the heavy dressing. BF had the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp.  He thought it was going to be spicy, but it turned out to be very sweet, and completely covered in toasted coconut.  It was okay, but I wouldn't order it again, and neither would be.   The bill for the appetizer, two entrees, and two cocktails came to $67 before tip.  Interestingly, his bottle of Fat Tire was $.50 more than my specialty cocktail."
Remy E.,"La Palma, CA",255,254,12,4.0,2/19/2007,"I like Cheesecake Factory a lot so, when my best friend and I decided to go out to eat we decided to go here.  I pretty much like anything I've ever ordered here and the banana cream cheesecake is to die for.  I always get it.  The only downfall of this place is that it's always crowded.  No matter when.  But I think it's worth the wait.   Notable dishes:  Grilled Eggplant Sandwich for the Veggies out there which I used to be, Jambalaya, Chipotle penne, Shepherd's Pie, their mashed potatoes, cashew chicken, thai chicken pasta, etc.  That's all I could think of for now."
JT N.,"Long Beach, CA",5,46,52,3.0,11/12/2010,"Good service, decent food.  Consistent with other Cheesecake Factory."
Shig N.,"Huntington Beach, CA",28,133,5,4.0,9/1/2008,"Like most of the Cheesecake Factory, the reason to visit is to enjoy their desserts.  Oh, don't get me wrong.  It's not that the food is inadequate, but the cheesecake is superb! We went with the Seymours.  I had the fish and chips which were tasty.  Then when it came time for desserts I had the chocolate mousse cheesecake.  I had to take about half of my fish and chips dinner home with me."
