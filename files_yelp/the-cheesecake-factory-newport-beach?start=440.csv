Kim N.,"South Bay, CA",2945,9796,55587,4.0,9/12/2006,"Again, the consistency of the food and vibe are scarily consistent. However being in Newport, this one doesn't seem to draw the crowds (I guess wealthy old rich people don't do C.F. I guess). If you've done your hard shopping in Fashion Island it's a good spot to grab a bite and lounge. What's special about this one is if you sit in the right place you can get spectacular ocean and sunset view."
Maj H.,"San Jose, CA",17,72,2,5.0,3/28/2007,"I love Cheesecake Factory, doesn't matter the location, the food is always consistent.  I've been to many CFs...San Francisco, Seattle, Pasadena, Beverly Hills, San Jose, Marina Del Rey to name a few.  All CFs are similarly decorated.  However, the CF at Newport Beach has the added advantage of an ocean view as does Marina Del Rey.  But I personally think that the view at Newport Beach is more spectacular.   I've tried a lot of different items on their very expansive menu.  Their Sunday brunches are excellent.  I highly suggest the egg's benedict and Joe's special.  Some of my favorites lunch/dinner entrees are: the bistro shrimp pasta, chinese chicken salad, cajun jambalaya pasta, bang bang chicken and shrimp, shepard's pie, thai chicken pasta,..is this list getting too long?  I'm not even finish listing all the dishes I like yet.  Bottom line, you can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  Happy eating."
Raheman D.,"La Jolla, CA",0,38,,1.0,7/7/2013,In June I ordered Evelyn's Favorite Pasta for lunch and it was the worst pasta dish I have ever eaten.  The pasta was hard and either old or undercooked.  The mixed vegetables were tasteless and overcooked.  How do they stay in business!
Josh S.,"Mission Viejo, CA",185,662,167,4.0,5/25/2007,"I love Cheesecake Factory and don't understand the bitching.  You know there will be a wait, regardless of what time you get there, so be prepared for it.  If you don't want to wait, drive thru McDonald's.   Cheesecake has a phenomenal menu the size of a small phone book.  There is something for everyone spanning many different types of foods.  The quantity they give you is great for the price.   I personally love the crusted chicken romano.  Its chicken breaded with romano cheese and then topped with a combo marinara/alfredo sauce that is awesome.  My wife and friends all love the fire roasted artichoke as well.  I've had several of their pizzas, burgers, sandwiches, teriyaki chicken, you name it and all have been good.   Dessert is also great if you like Cheesecake.  Its hard to save room and time for it but if you do, order it.  I like the dulce de leche one as well as some of the insanely chocolate ones.  Oh yeah, don't forget the AWESOME strawberry lemonade (with or without Vodka!)!!!!  (This place was one of the originals with these and now everyone has it but none as tasty) Its a chain, its packed, but the menu is huge, prices are reasonable and the food is good!"
Ari K.,"Alhambra, CA",120,255,2,4.0,10/9/2010,"The best location....minus all the noise that you find in Pasadena....the booth was a little elevated which is always nice....service good and I find their chain food good enough to eat!...eclectic, creative, good potions, the flavors are there...."
Toni L.,"Los Angeles, CA",907,873,3488,4.0,9/17/2007,"I can say pretty much the same thing about every Cheesecake Factory in the chain, so I will. 1) Long wait w/ no possibility for a reservation 2) BAD service 3) Fattening food that tastes awesome while you're in the restaurant but might give you indigestion after a few hours pass 4) Leftovers galore 5) Half cheesy (HAHAHA) half art nouveau decor which works in my opinion but I can see how it might not for everyone Some notes about this particular location: This is the first CF I've ever been to and seeing as it is a little nicer than most in terms of location (inside a useless but gorgeous mall), it has really colored my vision of what a CF should be. The wait at this location is not as horrible as it is in most of the LA locations although things may have changed since I've last dined here."
Michelle N.,"San Francisco, CA",95,213,4,4.0,6/22/2008,"I've been to several cheesecake factories in California and recently visited the one in Irvine. This one wasn't particularly special from the rest, but I just decided to review it because it was the most recent one I had visited. The service was really great. We were served by a guy named Ron who was polite, entertaining, funny, nice, and serviceful. We had a party of 8, and everyone really enjoyed their food. They have a very diverse and unique menu... Asian-fusion, Mexican-American, Sandwiches, etc. My food was excellent: Corn Cake Tamales for appetizer and Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp as my entree. All of the other dishes I've tried at CF have always pleased me. Even their salads are good. My boyfriend had the Vegetable Chopped Salad and I heard no complaints. My only wish is that they give you smaller entrees so that there could be more room for dessert ;)"
Kyle V.,"Los Angeles, CA",101,339,15,3.0,3/31/2007,"You have to love the large portions of food here. As long as you aren't there on a date, make sure to pack it up and eat what's left later. Two meals for one is a nice deal. Some would say, ""Kyle, how can you stand going to newport, let alone Fascist Island Area?"" Well, I would like to point out that people watching in this area can be as good as the corner cafe in greenwich village. While I might be spying the lower end of the human spectrum in newport, it's still just as entertaining. there is a reason reality tv is still hot."
Ariane P.,"Huntington Beach, CA",7,17,,5.0,3/28/2010,"I've been here twice: once about 2 weeks ago and once about 2 years ago haha. It's a nice restaurant, I cant think of anything bad about it. I love when places give you free bread in the beginning, and Cheesecake Factory does this so I'm a fan! I think it's honey-oat bread and sourdough maybe, but it's really good and soft and warm and if I could, I'd just eat that and then leave ha. If you come here, you BETTER save room for dessert, because they have a huge selection to choose from. Last time I went, I got this strawberry shortcake thing that came with vanilla ice cream, sliced strawberries, whipped cream, and shortcake, and it was delicious. I also tried their red velvet cake and it was good too. It had white chocolate shavings on it! It was a little too sweet in my opinion, though. But overall, I think this restaurant is pretty affordable, delicious food, nice portion-sizes, really friendly staff, and nice atmosphere. Not to mention the view...of the parking lot haha."
Kale R.,"Roseville, CA",8,60,1,4.0,4/14/2008,"I decided to give the Cheesecake Factory at Fashion Island a try. The one here in Sacramento made me pretty sick the last two times I tried it, but what the hey, right? I had the kobe beef burger (hold the mushrooms, please.) and the wife had an orange chicken dish. The food was surprisingly good, and tasted fresh. I felt the burger was well worth the money. Even better, was the service. Our server was Clark, and when my wife asked for some hot mustard sauce, he went out of his way to find some. I was very impressed. (He had to run to another restaurant to get some.) Good service, good food. I'll go again, when I'm in the area."
Nikki P.,"Orange, CA",171,118,21,2.0,8/3/2010,"I have been coming to this Cheesecake Factory for years now. I had to have been 10 years old my first time at this location. I used to love it, was my fave place to dine. I had quite a few of my birthdays here from 16 up until 20. Is it me or it that when a place is open for a while, the longer it's open the worse the service gets. It's like they stop trying. The wait has always been long. I suggest you get there early because guaranteed you'll wait at least 30 minutes. Then seating is another issue. It's crowed. If u sit in the middle I hope you don't mind dining with strangers. Service seems to just get worse. There's nothing worse than having a fake waiter or waitress.  So far the review isn't going so well for this place but oh it gets worse. So on my 20th birthday I went to this Cheesecake Factory. Of course had to wait about 45 minutes before getting seated. Shortly after I was upset because the wicker chairs snagged my dress. I didn't let it get to me though. So we order and we get our bread. I grab my knife and I look over at my silverware and to my suprise there was a huge disgusting chunk of food on my fork. So no biggie whatever, I was grossed out but didn't want to make a bug deal out of it. So the waiter just brings me out another one. I check it and there's food on that one too. Ugh so gross. It was not dried up food either it was disgusting looking soggy food. The waiter comes back apologizes and gets the manager. What does the manager do? Gives me two free deserts. Really!? Really now!!! We laughed finished our food and said keep your measly desert we're never coming back here again.  Food was Luke warm. Service was horrible. On top of that we were not pleased with how the manger handled that situation.  So after that whole ordeal I decided to give it another shot after a coulple years. So 23 I go back and service was a little better but I was not satisfied. To my disappointment it's just not the same. Not sure if they are under new management or what but it was a bad experience. I went there recently for a friends birthday and it still is the same.  I suggest getting a window seat if possible. There is a beautiful view. I'll give this location that much but overall not worth it. I will not be coming back to this Cheescake Factory.  If you agree with me then try going to the one at The Irvine Spectrum. One at Bella Tera was good when it first opened but service and food quality is starting to suck. Best bet us to go to the one at the Spectrum or to wait until you go out of state. Seattle, WA one was great!"
A B.,"Los Angeles, CA",221,351,,3.0,7/16/2009,"This particular Cheesecake Factory is located in Fashion Island. Personally, my three favorite entrées are the Grilled Pork Chops, Beef Ribs, and Miso Salmon. Buffalo Blasts are my favorite of the appetizers. I have found the food at this Cheesecake Factory to be consistent with other Cheesecake Factory restaurants. However, the wait staff at this location seem particularly attentive."
Ryan S.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",95,226,5,3.0,6/16/2010,Went here to grab a bite during Game 6 of the finals after waiting over an hour and a half at Yardhouse. I got the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp and was impressed with the meal. The curry and coconut flavors were great and the chicken and shrimp were cooked perfectly. My buddy got a steak and I had a bite and that was better than expected too. Menu selections here are great which makes it a good place for groups. Not my first choice but definitely a good meal.
Emily M.,"Pāpa‘aloa, HI",19,37,2,1.0,7/23/2012,"laaaaaame. went here with my little sister to get some desert and was waiting at the cheesecake counter foreveeer. literally nobody said hi, asked if we needed anything, yet they were all smiles and talking to each other. even the manager was behind the counter. im really not picky about customer service at all..was just really surprised at how akward that situation was :P ill make my own damn cheesecake next time, itl probably take less time :]"
Rylan C.,"San Francisco, CA",671,538,25,3.0,1/23/2010,"Like all the other Cheesecake Factories the food is good. The menu is huge. In fact, probably too big. This particular location is really pretty because it has a perfect view of the Newport beach shore. Dinner during sunsets are absolutely stunning. This location goes on my top 2 of the best views in a Cheesecake Factory (second only to the view from the San Francisco, Union Square location). I, like everyone else in the world, has been to a Cheesecake Factory at least once so I don't really need to review the food. What makes this location stand out is definitely the view."
Josh B.,"Tustin, CA",1193,42,1,5.0,2/21/2010,5 Stars for the Shrimp and Bacon Club...amazing. Oh and for Squaw bread
Ming L.,"Irvine, CA",186,180,36,2.0,4/2/2012,"I haven't been to Cheesecake Factory for 15 years now since the high school days. I went back again last night to remember how it tasted. Meh, I thought it was pretty terrible to say the least. Everything they serve is so rich and heavy in flavor. I had the avocado spring rolls, shrimp and chicken gumbo, and fettucini with chicken and sun dried tomatoes. The avocado spring rolls were the best of the three, but I couldn't stand the richness. I ate 2 spring rolls and a third of my shrimp and chicken gumbo and I was full, heavy full and not in a good way. The shrimp and chicken gumbo lacked any spicyness although it was described on the menu as such. The shrimp was not fresh as it was hard and dry. Fettucini was oily, cheesy, and chicken dry. Totally unsatisifed and would not go back for the food. The decor is nothing special either. Turn up the lights and you'll see no artistic design or style. I don't know why they are as successful as they are. 2 stars for the dessert."
Dinah B.,"Irvine, CA",0,3,,3.0,6/25/2014,"We celebrated my daughter's high school graduation at this restaurant last night. We came in for an early dinner that's why there was no wait at all. We were seated at a good spot. The waiter took our orders for appetizers (Thai Lettuce Wraps and Avocado Eggrolls) and were served a few minutes later. The waiter should have given us a much bigger plate and not leave us with just a bread plate. The waiter then introduced us to a new server, Marissa, because his shift was over. For our main entrees, my older daughter ordered  Fettucini Alfredo, I ordered Chicken Marsala and Mushrooms, my other daughter ordered Fettucini with Chicken and Sun-dried Tomatoes which my sister in law ordered too. My husband ordered a Chicken Salad Sandwich with Sweet Potato Fries. Halfway into our dinner, my husband's order hasn't arrived so we called the attention of Marissa who profusely apologized for the error. A few minutes later she came back with the order but brought the regular french fries and not the sweet potato ones. She apologized again and the fries came back at a much later time which the manager brought to our table. We kept our cool because Marissa was apologetic anyway and then the neat thing was she told us that my husband's order was on her including a free dessert of our choice to go (I picked Chris' Outrageous Chocolate Cake). We saved almost $20 for their error. It wasn't a bad experience but not a good one either because we could have responded to Marissa rudely but we chose not to for obvious reasons. We gave her a tip of 15% only because of the error she made :) We usually go to their Irvine Spectrum location for family dinners but we chose their Fashion Island location this time because of the distance from UCI where graduation was held. Overall experience was OK. We will still go back there someday despite what happened."
Chelsea h.,"Santa Ana, CA",9,8,2,4.0,5/13/2010,Ok so first of all this place can be super overwhelming because the menu is huge. You can order a chinese chicken salad and get a burrito if you want all in the same night. Who would of thought. However with that said the food it really up to par. I ordered the bbq chicken pizza and it had all the right elements and tasted amazing. So if you want of variety of choices and good tasting food than the cheesecake factory is your place.
Royce Y.,"Fullerton, CA",204,216,7,4.0,9/2/2009,"OVERALL RATING = 8 / 10 Overall FOOD = 8 What I had:      House Bread = 5      Avocado Eggrolls = 8      Farfalle w/ Chicken & Roasted Garlic = 9      Miso Salmon = 8 Drinks:      Water = 5    ATMOSPHERE = 8 SERVICE = 7 ---COMMENTS--- Went w/family for lunch. My wife claims to love their house bread as one of the best. I don't quite agree. It's good, but I could name so many other places with more memorable bread. The avocado eggrolls does compete with the ones from BJ's. My wife prefers these ones more because they load the avocado in each eggroll and they're crispier. I agree with the crispiness aspect, however, CCF's Tamarind-Cashew Dipping Sauce, though it wasn't bad, doesn't compare to BJ's sweeter Tamarind sauce. Note: I learned what Tamarind was today. Interesting that both places pair their Avocado Eggrolls with Tamarind. Seems like someone cheated off the other one. The miso salmon was so thick and juicy. I was surprised we would get this quality of salmon at a place like this. The miso sauce, which was kind of strong, in a good way, went very well with the buttery-ness of the salmon. It's too bad the only other thing they serve with the fish is a bed of rice, which was decent, and 5-6 snow peas. I should write Evelyn and ask her to throw some steamed brocolli on top or something. My wife LOVES salmon and thought it was great, but got tired of the the taste and couldn't finish the last couple bites. Besides that, it's overall a good salmon dish. Farfalle pasta is probably one of the best pasta dishes I've had at a restaurant. The roasted garlic, parmesan sauce is what makes this dish and it's got sun-dried tomato, peas, & pancetta to not only give it flavor, but color as well.  We were fortunate enough to get seated at in a booth with an awesome view of the ocean. Looking forward to going again period. Enjoy."
