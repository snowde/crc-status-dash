Zina D.,"Riverside, CA",41,111,18,4.0,2/16/2009,"I love the look of this one. Its in the Fashion Island, so you can shop after eating, if its not late. The waiter was ok. He was cute, so whatever. Nothing was dropped or broken lol. It was a little busy, so we had to wait for about 20 minutes. Drinks were yummy. I was a little tipsy, so I don't remember what I had. Love their pastas and their cheesecakes (their specialty of course)."
Susan N.,"El Sobrante, CA",13,180,7,4.0,5/16/2009,"I was favorably impressed with the Cheesecake Factory in Fashion Island.  We had a large party, including two toddlers, but the waiter was very flexible when taking our orders that ran the gamut from children's menu items to pizza to steak.  All of the dishes were served promptly  (several waiters brought our food to the table).  My Chicken Di Pana was flavorful (without being overly salty). the mashed potatoes incorporated the potato peels which gave them more substance, and the broccoli was thoroughly cooked, but not soggy.  I'm not a big onion ring fan (I can stop at one), but theirs were nice and crisp.  Almost all of us needed doggy bags for leftovers, and unfortunately, we were too full for dessert!"
A P.,"Irvine, CA",8,61,1,5.0,10/17/2011,"I have been going to this Cheesecake Factory for about 5 years now and all I can say is that our server Shelly (she's been our server by request for 5 yrs now) makes the whole experience that much better. The food, drinks, and desserts are good but Shelly is beyond fantastic. She already knows what drinks to bring us as soon as we sit down even before asking and she remembers exactly how we want our food depending on what we order (extra tomatoes, no celery, chopped chicken, no breading on shrimp, etc.). Hopefully she will be at this location for a long time because I cannot imagine having a different server!"
Aaron A.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",0,43,1,1.0,12/27/2009,My wife and I were ahead of 4 suit type guys yet all of a sudden they were seated ahead of me.  My protests fell on deaf ears.  I was appaled to receive such poor service.  We decided to leave and had a nice meal at CPK.
Jason Y.,"San Francisco, CA",480,124,,2.0,6/12/2009,"Seriously this was one of the worst experiences of my life. After going here with my family to celebrate, I decided to order the Chicken Alfredo with sun dried tomatoes and boy was I extremely disappointed. I feel like I was eating cardboard and after just a few bites I couldn't stomach it anymore. Along with a 15 dollar price tag I could have gone to any pizza hut and ordered a more satisfying pasta. The only thing that was good was the bread and the service along with the Gumbo that they served. Way too overrated."
Allan N.,"Orange County, CA",0,29,3,1.0,3/31/2009,"I've been to several Cheesecake Factories and don't like this one.  The hostesses I encountered were snobby and made my date and me wait a long time to be placed in a bad location.   The food was not nearly as good as at other Cheesecake Factories I've been to.  (My date and I ordered the same dishes we've had before.) The one redeeming point of the night was that the waiter was friendly (forgot his name). Personally, I like the Cheesecake Factory at the Irvine Spectrum the most and will never come to this one at Fashion Island again."
Fan J.,"Arlington, VA",2,20,,4.0,4/5/2010,"This review is somewhere b/w a 3.5 and a 4. First of all, the portions at this place are a bit ridiculous. It's nearly impossible for two people to finish their entrees and dessert, so if you eat regularly, perhaps consider sharing a salad or appetizer and then an entree before the inevitable cheesecake. I don't remember exactly what we had the first, but I think it was the Steak Diane for my gf and some combo with chicken and salmon for me. Both were decent (3~4-star) -- nothing bad about it but not unforgettable (cuz I obviously forgot). The dessert was probably the chocolate mousse cheesecake, and it was sweeter than expected, but with a 'balanced' richness as it should (3~4-star). The 2nd time, we both had pastas. She got the shrimp with angel hair -- shrimp was good (large, well-seasoned) but pasta was a bit bland after the shrimp were devoured (3~4-star). I got Evelyn's Favorite, which was a blend of at least half a dozen veggies -- eggplant, sun-dried tomatoes, and the pine-nuts mixed well though some people might not like it (4-star). Again, the portions were huge, I tried to help my gf with the angel hair, but I had to save room for... the lemoncello cream torte. By then, we were basically stuffed and could only finish half of the cake, which was good, not too sweet or sour, and I would've liked to have eaten more of it (4-star). The food is about a 3~4-star average. I've had a couple of their burgers here as well, but at a different location. The decor at this particular location is quite nice. There is a long set of stairs that wind up to the restaurant where warm jazz welcomes you, and the 2-seat tables are well-designed. I would recommend coming after 8pm on a weekend to avoid the crowd. Quite romantic overall, so that pulls it closer to a 4-star rating."
Mike P.,"Long Beach, CA",0,4,,1.0,1/10/2014,"Came in for a celebration dinner with my fiancé. We have eaten here on many occasions and will never be coming back after our last and most current visit. When we first arrived we checked in with the hostess on staff for Friday night. She had indicated it would be a 30min wait to be seated which we did not argue cause the restaurant seemed on the busy side. After 40 mins we were paged to come stand by the hostess desk (standard procedure). But after waiting an additional 15mins and watching people that were paged after us be sat we asked the same hostess how much longer. A second hostess by the name of Lisa working the seating computer stated she had put us on hold because we never turned in our pager... Come to find out surprising enough we did turn in our page and the other hostess even recalled us giving her the pager 15mins prior. When we were finally seated our table wasn't cleaned and no silverware or napkins were present. Since this exact series of events had taken place on our last visit as well, involving the same staff members, we will not be returning here again and suggest the readers of this don't either."
Rene S.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,4,1,5.0,10/17/2010,This is one of my favorite places to eat.No matter what I order from here it has been great.The portions are big so you usually have something to take home and the flavor is great.I have tried the tuna tataki salad and the wasabi crusted tuna both excellent when I have a graving for seafood.Also I like the Louisiana chicken pasta and the chicken costaleta.The Godiva brownie sundae is the kids and I choice. You can pretty much throw a dart at their menu and no matter what you get is great.
Elyse P.,"Portland, OR",171,29,1,3.0,6/11/2011,"I went to this Cheesecake Factory yesterday for a work-related outing.  It was a gloomy day, but the restaurant overlooks the ocean- if it had been sunny, I'm sure the patio would have been a fantastic place to sit for the meal.  We didn't get any appetizers, (complimentary bread was served with butter) and for my meal I ordered the green chile burger.  It was highly recommended by our server, who was attentive and always within a few feet of our table, it seemed.  The burger was very unique- it had green chiles, tortilla strips, salsa, and some type of cheese.  It was served with a side of green peppers and I opted for the fries (hey, it was Friday).  The fries were crispy and excellent, and the burger was very tasty.  It was pretty big and I could only eat half of it- later on in the day, my body felt super sluggish, like I had ingested way too much salt. Overall, a fantastic experience except for the end of our meal when our server pressed us a bit too much to order coffee and dessert.  Saying no once should be enough, methinks. Next time I am going to try the cheesecake!"
Mark G.,"Turlock, CA",3,14,5,4.0,4/19/2009,"A lean clean food serving machine. You can't go wrong with the Cheesecake Factory. Great food, great service, fast. The restaurant was busy when I arrived and I was seated in 2 minutes. Fresh bread was brought as soon as I sat down. Any restaurant that provides fresh bread when seated automatically gets a couple stars. Refill time on drinks was good, not great, but good. Appetizers took a few minutes but were worth the wait (the sweet corn tamale cakes are delicious). The entrée followed and was prompt and hot on the table. I recommend this restaurant for those who like to enjoy a good dining experience."
Jennifer M.,"Westminster, CA",36,172,33,4.0,4/1/2007,"The food is always very good with large portions, and their Arnold Palmer is tied for first with Roscoe's in my opinion!  Of course there is a huge array of choices when picking out your cheese cake! Minus 1 star for the snotty clientele..."
Peter C.,"Southeast Portland, Portland, OR",46,86,,5.0,10/25/2007,"I just don't think you can go wrong with Cheesecake factory.  I've had quite a bit of their menu, and I've never been disappointed.  Chicken Madeira, they used to have something called the seafood scatter... shrimp poorboy, sheppard's pie... even the Steaks here could give steakhouses a good run for their money. And dessert?  Nice."
Randy S.,"Huntington Beach, CA",90,139,43,4.0,1/4/2008,"If I was strictly reviewing the strawberry Martinis it would be 10 stars (is that an option?) I men I've never waited for a table in a dozen visits, probably because I only want to sit t the bar...Geezus who waits an hour for a chain restaurant?  Anyway, an appy or two at he bar, but definitely strawberry martinis made from fresh crushed to your order w/ a tad bit of simple sugar and kettle one.  a bit pricey at $10, but worth it in my opinion."
Mary W.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,16,,2.0,7/18/2011,"I wouldn't write this negative review except that Cheesecake Factory is a repeat offender when it comes to sitting people in TINY tables with only 2 feet on either side between other tables. I've had this happen to me several times over the past few years at the Fashion Island location. Usually when this happens here I simply say that the table is way too small and ask to be moved, and they kindly find us another table.  But this weekend in particular I just really didn't want to have to wait for another table so I braved up and faced the tiny table. It was horrible. You can't have a conversation with the person you're with because you can't help but hear every word the other parties are saying on either side of you. The servers can barely fit in the space between the tables. And there's barely enough room to fit two entrees on your tiny table. It actually deterred us from ordering an appetizer - where the heck would we put it? Ugh. I almost gave this review only 1 star... but let's face it, Cheesecake Factory has great food which is why I have gone back over the years. But I won't be dining in anymore at the Fashion Island location - ""to go"" only here on out for me."
Christie X.,"San Francisco, CA",95,317,4,3.0,6/22/2007,"OK, I try not to review chain restaurants, because really...what is there to say about  them?  They're everywhere, they're popular for a reason and we all probably know why.  But this restaurant deserves a little story. Rewind to summer 1996.  I recently discovered that I was accepted to UCLA and  I was beyond ecstatic.  I met a new friend that promised  to show me around during my orientation.  Filled with glee, anticipation and excitement, I made my way down south.  When we decided to meet up, because I had never really been anywhere in So. Cal by myself, I was game for anything.  When we drove to Fashion Island and walked through the doors of Cheesecake Factory, I was so ""amazed.""   The ""newness"" of it all overwhelmed me - the decor, lighting, menu, food, portion size, hell - the SIZE of the restaurant impressed me.  I had NEVER seen anything quite like it back home.  I knew I had to tell everyone about it, especailly after my meal.  I ordered the rotisserie chicken (not sure it's the correct name, but I think that's it?) and was astounded by the size and taste!  Don't quote me on this, but I swear it was HALF A CHICKEN and the best tasting mashed potatoes I had ever tasted.   I couldn't believe my eyes and every other sensation I was experiencing.  Is everything in LA like this?  I was such a sweet, innocent, naive, little girl.   Since that summer, I have been to numerous Cheesecakes.  Many of the So. Cal establishments that I fell in love with during college eventually popped up elsewhere & CF was no exception.  About five years ago, they started sprouting up North, and yes, I was happy to indulge in my cravings and to create new experiences with friends & family, but the ""special"" feeling of going to one was gone.   That is, until I walk through the doors of this Newport Beach location, then suddenly, everything comes back.   Through the years, I've tried many different dishes and generally, am still satisfied by their consistency (other than the fact that some of their portions, believe it or not, have been reduced.)  A few years ago, I even ordered the chicken ""just because"" and it's no longer half a chicken, but the potatoes are still the shiz-nit.  :)   You honestly can't complain about CF.  Dollar for dollar, I always leave satisfied and stuffed.  And because there are so many gosh darn choices, if you go with a big party, there's always something new to try.  Of course, b/c of its popularity, expect an insane line if you go during normal lunch/dinner hours - especially this location.  If you get a table on the north end of the restaurant with the sky high windows, take in the spectacular view.  No matter how many different Cheesecake Factories I've tried, this one in Newport Beach holds a special place in my heart.  I almost always end up eating here if I'm at Fashion Island.  (In case you're wondering, the ""friend"" and I no longer talk - we've drifted through the years, but I will always remember him for introducing me to CF - thx again, B.)"
Senna L.,"Laguna Beach, CA",0,20,5,3.0,2/2/2008,"First off, service here SUCKs!! Waiters here are so rude and indifferent to the customers. I've been here two times with my friends only because we got hungry while shopping at Fashion Island.  Food is overpriced considering the quality and taste of it...it's so mediocre and bland~. Last time I got a flying gorilla, expecting a chocolatey deliciousness, but what I got was a bitter disaster of a drink! I could only drink 1/5 of it because it was so bitter! YUCK!  I would've given it 2 stars, but I'm giving it one more star because of their Dutch Apple Caramel Streusel."
shoba d.,"San Francisco, CA",41,265,,4.0,8/19/2005,"I've never eaten at the Cheesecake Factory before, and so my friend thought it was high time I tried it.  I must admit I liked it.  The portions are huge (I took my slice of cheesecake home and had it for breakfast for the next two mornings).  You must try the fried mac-and-cheese balls-- they are ridiculously rich and  wonderfully tasty."
Jonathan Y.,"Monrovia, CA",61,198,1,4.0,12/30/2006,"The crowds are not as huge, and the ambience seems a little more warm than other locations. Perhaps because the noise levels aren't as dreadful *cough*sf*cough*. I'd definately recommend this location before a nice time along the Newport shoreline :)"
Mike C.,"Brooklyn, NY",23,325,,4.0,11/22/2006,Always among my favorites. Menu is very diverse so the variety works well depending on your craving that day. The Southern Pecan cheesecake is my favorite. Can get pretty crowded but the dining area has a great view of the ocean.
