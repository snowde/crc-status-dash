Kyle O.,"Irvine, CA",173,48,1,5.0,9/19/2008,"Today was my first time eating at this Cheesecake Factory. One of my favorite and most common places to eat dinner is the Cheesecake Factory at the Irvine Spectrum Center, and this one is no different. When we walked in, we found that it was very busy, so we were afraid we'd have to wait a long time, but we extremely surprised and happy that we were seated after only like 5 minutes. Our waiter was extremely nice (His name was Ron, so maybe I had the same one as you Michelle!) and helped us with some questions we had. My girlfriend and I both got the penne marinara, and they got it to us in about 5 or 10 minutes. It was very good, although I think they put most of my sauce on my girlfriend's haha. We also had the sweet corn cakes, which were so tasty I couldn't even believe it. I would highly recommend getting those items and visiting this Cheesecake Factory."

Nancy S.,"San Marcos, CA",0,35,,2.0,3/2/2012,"I realize that true ""foodies"" find chain restaurants such as this one far beneath them, but I'm no foodie.  I'm just out for a good meal.  There were nine of us, including one toddler, with that goal in mind Tuesday night at Fashion Island.  The place was half-empty, so we were seated quickly.  All of us have been to Cheesecake Factories many times before and have never been disappointed.  Too bad this meal was the exception.  Service from waitress ""M"" was horrific!  Could it be because she was guaranteed an 18% tip since we were a party of 6 or more?  One little bread basket for nine people??  Get serious!!!  Twenty minutes after sitting down, we had to ASK for the little ""baby plate"" that others were given immediately after being seated.  Baby was fussy because he was starved!  Come on!!  ""M"" was definitely having a bad night.  Would it kill her to crack a smile?!   Geez!  Meals were VERY slow in coming, and plates were piling up on the table and never getting cleared.  Water glasses were empty, with few offers for refills.  Ughhhhhh!  Food, on the other hand, was very good, with the only exception being the ""Skinnylicious"" Chicken Enchiladas, which were cold, dry and tasteless.  Other dishes, esp. the Hibachi Steak, were excellent.  And, of course, the cheesecake (when it finally arrived) was superb.  2.5 hours later, we were out of there -- full but still thirsty for those water refills that never came."
Angel Q.,"Irvine, CA",7,342,70,1.0,5/23/2009,"of all the times i've been to this place, i actually don't like this place.   if i ever give a resturant a 1 star, its pretty bad.   today was my 1st visit in a long time and will be my last.  it was very annoying.  when we showed up early to ask about seat availability, the waitress at the counter told us to come back in an hour and it will be fine.  When we showed up, she simply shuffed my friends and i to the side without telling us why.  then later they told us its a 25 to 30 minute wait.  reason?  because some large party came in and took all the spots.  uh.... we told you we were coming back in an hour.  you KNOW better we are coming, yet you give up our seats to other people.  while we stood around to wait, they had some waiter called some other name with the same amount of seats we need.   whoever name they called, those 6 people weren't there.  they just reserved the menu to those people who didn't exist.  if i cared enough, i would probably call and complain to the manger and perhaps the headquarters. this place is  just like some of the other reviewers said, the waiter/waitresses weren't very nice and snobby.  what did we do?  we gave money to somebody else.  too bad for you overly priced cheesecakes and their makers. :-P years ago when i came here.  it wasn't very plesant either.  they charged us some 20% tip onto our bill because we had a large party.  not like they did much, and i don't see any reason to give you guys that much tip.  its pretty much robbery."
Randy M.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",43,46,2,4.0,7/6/2008,"consistent with most cheesecake factories (redondo beach, brea, marina del rey, pasadena, santa clara, and etc). i think i've been to way too many. it would be nice to find another restaurant like this. good service, food at a reasonable price, and good drinks. can't go wrong with the chicken madeira! aiming to eat light... order an entree and split it. pretty good size portions."
