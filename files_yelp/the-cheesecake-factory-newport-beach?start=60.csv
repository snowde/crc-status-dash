Annie L.,"Atlanta, GA",715,924,1252,5.0,11/1/2015,"I can't begin to describe the experience I received here at Cheesecake Factory. To be fair, I'm a  flipping veteran when it comes to Cheesecake Factory. Having dined at this establishment for over 10 years and counting, we are clearly obsessed with this restaurant. When it comes to food, we are addicted to their endless amount of food choices/drinks/etc.  Food aside, what I want to write a review about is the spectacular service we had this past Saturday. It was lunch, not a special occasion, just a typical meal. Shelly F. was our server and from start to finish she was on top of it. From the little things like making sure our meal was made perfect by our request and giving her opinion on certain dishes when needed....to hot towels (really??) to wipe our hands post meal and lastly, to-go beverages! Simple, easy to execute, but sooooo appreciated! She went above and beyond with the service, and I can honestly say I've never had better service in my life than with Shelly. Shelly you made my day! Oh, and the food. Get the thai glazed salmon. Holy moly. You won't regret it."
D L.,"Newport Beach, CA",5,49,13,1.0,8/3/2017,I had their version of a French Dip sandwich.  The wait for the food was long and the sandwich itself was average but the au jus was very salty.  After eating the sandwich I felt nauseous and sluggish.  The food wasn't a good experience but what made it even worse was the aftermath of that sandwich.  Avoid at all costs unless you are busy going for alcohol. This was my second bad experience at a Cheesecake Factory but there won't be a third.
Michelle V.,"San Jose, CA",25,314,151,1.0,11/23/2016,"I was so excited to come here after a long weekend at a conference in SoCal. There were no reservations allowed, but when we called in, the staff said they can accommodate 80 people no problem, with an estimated waiting time of 20 minutes.  We came. They moved it up to 1.5 to 2 hours. There were several parties who came while we were waiting, and they were served before us. Though some of us were let in, a number of us ended up leaving due to a time crunch. 1/5 terrible"
Ernie D.,"Newport Beach, CA",0,127,,2.0,2/21/2017,Pleasant atmosphere and solid service but very bland tasteless food.  The apps were extremely mundane and the balance of the menu we trying was really quite poorly done and again bland. The cheesecakes which is clearly their specialty was just YIKES ok....
Doc S.,"Burbank, CA",3,48,14,2.0,6/25/2017,"We have been here twice in the past month and were hoping and praying that our miserable experience the first time might have been an anomaly.  Nope.  Yikes!!!  What happened to the quality at this location?!?  The food was overcooked, bland, and not even close to the quality we have come to expect from The Cheesecake Factory.  Profoundly disappointed!!  May, or may not be back."
Melanie P.,"Columbus, GA",2,17,3,5.0,8/17/2017,This chain never disappoints!  I love artichoke and their Fire-Grilled is the best no matter which location we go to. Also had the chicken potstickers - yummy!!!
Nijole T.,"Los Angeles, CA",3080,6372,5149,3.0,10/10/2016,"Enormous menu, way too many options, you get bored with the menu, way too much reading and way too overwhelming. Service was rushed, they are way too busy to offer great service. Prices are a bit high for the quality that you get, don't expect great meats, best to stick to the basic dishes. You can tell the food is mass produced and while it is a bit better than some of your run of the mill chain restaurants, it's not a place I would chose to return to."
Martha P.,"Oceanside, CA",16,19,7,5.0,2/17/2017,"Family having a fabulous lunch here right now. My Thai Lettuce Wraps are the best I've ever had anywhere! Sisters had BBQ chicken pizza, cauliflower steak and Skinny Chopped Salad, etc. All fantastic with very fresh ingredients.  Thanks for the excellent service, too; Araceli(sp?) was a great!"
Kate B.,"Irvine, CA",233,238,348,5.0,6/12/2016,"Currently eating here. Matt is our server who is very knowledgeable and has provided us with excellent service so far. Our party has ordered the Falafel Salad, 4 cheese pasta and the Cuban. We are starting with the avocado egg rolls and cheese bread. We will most likely order a piece of cheesecake for dressers. When in Rome! Never disappointed."
Christian S.,"Fullerton, CA",125,3,,5.0,5/21/2017,I I frequent the to go at cheesecake and Alejandro is probably the best worker there. I was waiting on my order and just watching him get all these orders out in a timely fashion and with the best attitude!!!!
Virginia A.,"Covina, CA",151,18,88,5.0,1/25/2017,JW Lemonade is delightful.  If you don't have room for dessert you can have this instead.
Frances Y.,"Anaheim, CA",0,19,,5.0,7/9/2017,Great food and service. Went on the slimming menu and found lettuce wraps. But there was also lettuce wraps in the appetizer section. Server said the lettuce wraps which had three tacos was enough.  Sure enough it was more than plenty.  Tacos were premise. Huge ! Two was plenty and three I had to push myself. Little messy but both sauces were excellent. Loved it   My husband had shrimp and chicken with pineapple lunch. He enjoyed it so very much. His plate was clean!! Definitely we'll Be back!!!
Ziara K.,"Anaheim, CA",454,7,1,4.0,7/17/2017,I go here quite often. The food is amazing. Im never dissappointed however the service is awful. Waiters/waitresses take forever to come back to you or theyll forget to bring what you asked for.
a v.,"Newport Beach, CA",205,51,62,1.0,2/14/2017,Love the cheesecake here. Its my birthday and after a beautiful dinner at another establishment i  opted out of having anything sweet post meal because i wanted to stop by and pick up some cheesecake slices from Cheese Cake factory to enjoy at home. Showed up and ordered a couple types of cheesecake and headed home. When i got home i realized that the girl that packaged the cheesecake literally packaged the wrong types of cheesecake...  i guess you should check the slices in front of them and confirm what youre getting or they might just toss in whatever flavor they choose with out listening to you.  Very unhappy.
Deanna V.,"Costa Mesa, CA",43,16,,5.0,7/14/2017,"Get food delivered by DoorDash and every single time it's BOMB! Nothing disappoints, anything you pick off the menu will be delicious. It's pretty much a guarantee!"
Gerry B.,"Westminster, CA",986,557,569,3.0,1/29/2016,"We have a Cheesecake Factory close at home, but its location is difficult for parking and although we have heard rave reviews - never visited. While visiting our friend, we decided to try out this Newport beach location and were impressed.  Here is why: As we entered we found ourselves surrounded with dozens of families waiting for tables and full tables as far as they eye could see - a rather grim sight when you are toting two hungry kids. To our surprise we were at the front of the line within seconds and handed a disk with a promise of a 10-15 minute wait ... and in 5 minutes we were seated!!! Still a little gun shy from the sheer number of patrons being served - we resolved that it would probably be quite some time before our orders were taken - or - we would see our food. Minutes after being settled in a waitress came to take our drink/appetizer order. We didn't time her - but it seemed like she walked into another room - was magically handed our drinks - and just had to return to the table with them ... it was FAST! We were ready to order when she returned (because we had been thinking if we didn't get our order in right away - we may never eat). Our food came, and it was a reasonable wait, not speedy fast and not super long...but the food itself was IMPRESSIVE! Hot, delicious, flavorful, large portions (had I I known I would have ordered and shared my meal). Then the waitress checked back several times, not annoyingly, to make sure we were happy, brought extra rolls & butter, refilled drinks, and even made time to chat a bit about where we were from --- ALL while giving the same service to others in her section. It was such a good visit we will try the one at home...  Oh yeah - we were too full to eat the cheese cake - so we took some to go - ate it the next day ... OMG good tiramisu cheesecake!"
Brizylla A.,"Glendale, Los Angeles, CA",2280,203,351,3.0,1/26/2016,"I came here on a Sunday night with my best friend and it was EMPTY. It's weird because normally the Cheesecake Factory restaurants I go to are always packed and it's like a 30-50 minute wait. But luckily we were seated immediately.  This Cheesecake Factory is smaller than the ones I usually go to. But the view is pretty nice, and I think it's even better at night. So I guess that compensates for everything. I did notice a lack of servers at this Cheesecake Factory (I saw one server with 5 tables). Our server was nice, but she didn't check up on us as much as I wanted her to. And she did lag on bringing us our drinks.  My friend and I weren't in the mood for big plates so instead we just ordered several small appetizers and just shared it. We originally ordered some spinach and artichoke cheese dip but our server told us that they apparently ran out of it so we got some nachos with spicy chicken and a sausage and ricotta flatbread. I was actually disappointed with the selections of food we got. I come to Cheesecake Factory often and I love everything I order - pastas, sandwiches, and burgers but I wouldn't recommend appetizers. The nachos were a big portion but it was just a bunch of chips- not enough guac, cheese, sour cream nor salsa. There was barely any chicken on them too. I understand that nachos are not a healthy food choice but I didn't understand why the chips had to be deep fried- like there was actual oil dripping from the chips. I was also annoyed with the flatbread we got, it was too small- not really sharable size. I do have to say the Georgia Peach (alcoholic beverage) was amazing but more on the too sweet side. I'm willing to check out other appetizers (but not reorder the ones I tried during this visit) and return here since I am a loyal fan to Cheesecake Factory."
Ryan B.,"San Francisco, CA",121,1,,1.0,7/8/2017,The food was fine but the service was subpar. First they told us the wait would be 20 minutes and we weren't seated for 45. Then the waitress didn't even approach our table until 10 minutes after we were seated.
Mark G.,"Costa Mesa, CA",0,6,2,1.0,3/15/2017,"Very mediocre experience. Service was lackadaisical, extremely slow and a bit arrogant. Food was tepid at best. Would never recommend it to any one or at least to anyone I care for. Too expensive and overhyped. I nearly cheap my front tooth as I tried to bite a piece of bread. Better off spending your money someplace else, Burger King or Jack in the Box are examples of places where I can get better food."
Jennifer H.,"Orange, CA",45,151,17,4.0,9/26/2016,The food was good. Their portions are huge! You'll most likely have leftovers. I think the price is fair. The dessert menu was a little overwhelming because they had like 40 different cheesecakes to choose from and I wanted all of them. Shoutout to Christie and Jorge for giving the best service ever.
