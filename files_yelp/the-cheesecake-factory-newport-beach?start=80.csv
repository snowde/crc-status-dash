Maddie H.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",47,4,2,5.0,6/24/2017,"Went for dinner last night for my best friend's birthday at this location and we were seated within our quote time and the blonde hostess was very polite as well as the brunette one that seated us. We got a view of the ocean in Dale's section. At first the service was slow because he seemed really busy with other tables, but I understood because I work in the restaurant business. He ended up being extremely nice and attentive when he was able to catch up on tables and provided the best service. He sang happy birthday to my friend with me and sincerely apologized for the wait. I would come back and ask for his section again!"
Francine Z.,"Granada Hills, CA",0,9,,1.0,6/19/2017,"Years ago used to go here all the time Then stopped as now eating more healthfully but heard they had  a new 'Superfood' category as well as healthier section All looked good and ordered their super antioxidant salad Was mostly just lettuce, tiny bits of avocado , 3 little pieces of broccoli and tiny specs of nuts That was it ! Bland dressing made this incredibly Blughhh They were always known for large tasty portions This was also pretty small ! Was really surprised ! Will go to CPK and stick to their roasted vege salad that is still great !"
Stephanie S.,"Garden Grove, CA",16,35,29,4.0,2/10/2016,"My sister and I came for lunch when it was pretty empty. The service is prompt, and our waitress was very friendly. They have a lunch-sized portion before 5PM for particular dishes.  They offer bread with butter, which includes honey whole wheat bread and sourdough, and it's good.  My sister ordered the Louisiana pasta, of which I thought tasted like cheese pizza in a pasta form, but the breaded chicken it's topped with is delicious.  I ordered the Pasta with Chicken and Scampi Sauce. The pasta seemed a little undercooked in one bite, but the chicken was moist and tender. The scampi sauce was a great and tangy sauce.  Unfortunately, we didn't get to try the cheesecake because we were way too full (didn't even finish our pasta). This place has one of the most decent pastas I've had, so if you're ever craving pasta and cheesecake, this is your place."
Christine H.,"Irvine, CA",340,69,251,4.0,10/17/2016,"Cheesecake Factory is great because they have so many food options. I can go there all the time and not get bored with the food choices. They are good for groups and there is also secret tables on the patio here, which are perfect for dates! You can sit out there and watch the newport sunset . Cheesecake there is so good and have to try the dulce leche one . Only thing is this location can get very busy so try to avoid the popular meal times."
Sergio M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,13,,1.0,6/11/2017,"Waited at bar for at least 5 min and was never acknowledged.  We went across to CPK. We were seated and waited within 5 min , Cheesecake Factory was a major disappointment less attidude more service; could've at least said hello. Thank you California Pizza Kitchen.Great service party of 5."
Rob L.,"Irvine, CA",4731,412,1621,3.0,12/6/2014,"We went there on a weekday around 2-ish for a late lunch and the place was maybe a-quarter or less full and had plenty of tables available.  But we were led to a tiny two-top in a dark corner.  Seeing that we were not happy with the table the hostess led us to a larger half-booth by the window which was much nicer.  But why didn't she just give us that table in the first place? BREAD: The bread that was brought to us was warm but very chewy - which means that the bread was not fresh from the oven but was microwaved. MAC & CHEESE BURGER:  This was a mistake.  I shouldn't have ordered it.  Being an avid burger lover, I love to try every single kind of burgers that's out there, so I couldn't resist ordering this when I saw it on the menu.  A burger that I've never had before. But the mac & cheese was just way too overwhelming to be a topping for a burger.  It was SO cheesy and SO salty that the burger itself was completely lost.  You could have used the best ground beef patty and the best ingredients in the World and it didn't matter because I couldn't even have tasted it. I know people who love mac & cheese would probably love this burger.  But then, if you love mac & cheese so much, you might as well have a mac & cheese sandwich instead.  Seriously ;) PASTA DA VINCI:  The Penne pasta was cooked perfectly al dente and was topped with sautéed chicken, mushrooms and onions with a Madeira wine sauce.  The wine sauce was really good and the dish had a rich Madeira aroma. The chicken was a bit bland but not bad.  Overall, the dish was good but not great. It's just an average Cheesecake Factory visit.  Not bad, but nothing impressive either, so a 3-star experience is just about right."
Jeffrey B.,"Loma Linda, CA",199,169,150,3.0,4/3/2017,The last time we were here the staff were extremely rude. We were with my great grandmother who is hard of walking and when we asked for a seat they were very rude about getting one from just fifteen feet away. When we were finally seated the service was good but the waiter forgot some things on our order. The food was very good so it made up for some of the poor service but overall the experience was mediocre at best.
Arielle A.,"Lake Forest, CA",0,6,2,1.0,9/14/2017,"Worse service! Worse staff! Unbelievably horrible service! Went after lunch rush during a week day with 14 people who had left a funeral and were hungry and wanted food and wanted drinks. Less than half the restaurant was full and took them 1 hour and 45 minutes to seat us because for some reason they didn't want to sit us in a section that was untouched because supposedly not having a waiter to wait us in that area. I call bs because there were 3 bar backs that were standing around having such in depth conversations that they didn't even acknowledge half of our group standing at the bar wanting drinks while we waited but took the older heavier blonde lady 8 minutes to stop her conversation to then acknowledge us and when she did her response oh did you guys just want water while you waited? Like are you serious?! We're standing at the bar looking at the menu to order expensive as hell alcoholic drinks. Like no dumb dumb we wanted alcohol! But okay an hour and 45 minutes later they finally seat us and with only one waitress like really 14 people with waitress...? Okay. She never asked if we wanted drinks just had a bussed bring water glasses and bread and then went around the table asking our food orders.... wtf?! We had to tell her we wanted to order drinks and appetizers first before our meals and she seemed annoyed... really that means you get a larger check which in turn means you get a bigger tip?!?! Like wow completely shocked at the service. The entire time we had to tell her what we needed and more drinks more napkins more appetizers and then at the end of the meal she brings the check without asking if we wanted dessert coffee tea another drink.... hello we wanted CHEESECAKE, I mean we are at Cheesecake Factory Like WTF! I was gunna flip out on her! Got our desserts and coffee and the bill ended up being well over $1000 and I am in the service industry so I always tip 30% . It was just so shocking to be in  Newport area and to receive such a horrible service from a place that is supposed to be known for good food and good service. Extremely disappointed."
Pankaj K.,"San Diego, CA",27,47,32,2.0,4/17/2017,"We are (were) a big fans of Cheesecake Factory.....and we have been to several.  Unfortunately what Cheesecake Factory stands for, this location definitely is NOT living up to its own standards.  Its located in a very nice part of town, but looks bit dated (we were visiting from San Diego).  Our server was not very friendly and food was bit of a disappointment.  Our veggie pasta had no veggies in it.  Rest of the items were also nothing to rave about.  With so many choices of family restaurant in this category, I doubt if we will ever go back to any Cheesecake Factory.  A very disappointing night !!"
Collin B.,"Glendale, AZ",13,46,22,4.0,2/10/2016,"Five stars for cheesecake!! Three stars for food... Obviously called Cheesecake Factory for a reason..... The cheesecake is amazing!!!! Restaurant food is ok. I've been 3 or 4 times and still haven't found a great ""mouth watering dish"". I think part of the problem is their food menu is HUGE! Lots to choose from, Mexican, Italian, burgers, etc. Which isn't necessarily a good thing.... But I'll give it to them, they serve all types of food. Overall, a good place to go, worth trying. I'll keep trying to find that awesome ""mouth watering dish"""
Yan L.,"Redlands, CA",107,256,622,3.0,2/16/2015,"Food: Complimentary wheat and sourdough bread. It's not always warm which is a bummer :-/ Kale & Quinoa Salad - I love this! It has sunflowers and grapes added in and the mixture definitely makes this salad special. I wish I knew what sauce they used. I would make it at home.  Da Vinci Pasta - I get it with linguine noodles but bow tie is good too. The linguine noodles were really salty for some reason. Good consistency but the saltiness sort of killed it because I couldn't taste the sauce as much. :-/ waitress was apologetic and said she'll tell the cook so hopefully this problem doesn't occur again.  Lemon Meringue Cheesecake - if you're a lemon meringue pie or just a lemon lover in general then you need to try this! It was so good. It tasted like exactly like lemon meringue pie but in cheesecake form. Mm!  Service: Great. Alisha was our server and she was very friendly and helpful. She'd check up on us every so often and while serving other tables she'd look around to see if any table needed help. Twice, I caught her eye and she'd come help us. A lot of servers don't do that. They just pay attention to the table they're at and carry on so I'm happy she was very attentive.  Interior: Really beautiful like any other Cheesecake Factory I've been to but this has got to be a favorite. There are seats that you can see the ocean from!"
Michelle Ann C.,"Boston, MA",54,139,218,4.0,2/14/2016,"Coming here is totally worth it during lunch time because of their lunch special! I usually order the crusted chicken Romano and white chocolate raspberry cheesecake for the dessert. The portions are huge and the food is delicious!  I also recommend coming here during happy hour because the appetizers are half off.  As for the drinks, they are a little too strong for me!  The service is usually slow here or inattentive but today is particular the waitress we had was great! She checked on us regularly and was extreme friendly. I wish I knew her name so I could put it on her but unfortunately I don't."
Dee-Ana P.,"Los Angeles, CA",31,70,34,5.0,7/9/2016,"Cheesecakes,  period! ----------+++++++ Yelp thinks my review above is too short so... Firecracker salmon blah blah,  strawberry shortcake blah blah,  spinach artichoke dip blah blah,  strawberry lemonade blah blah,  chopped salad,  Caesar salad blah blah,  any of the pastas blah blah...  ENJOY!"
Dawn M.,"Costa Mesa, CA",350,109,20,5.0,1/9/2017,"Very cute location! We typically visit The Cheesecake Factory at the Irvine Spectrum, but living in Costa Mesa, we thought we'd try this one. I like that it's upstairs. Not much of a few (just the parking lot), but it still makes it seem fancy. You can't really go wrong with Cheesecake's food. The service was great too. One of our plates had been delivered to the wrong table, so it was taking a bit longer than usual. The manager promptly came over to our table to tell us about the delay. Just an extra step to make us feel recognized. Also, you've got to try the new hazelnut cheesecake with Nutella - it's heaven!"
Nikki N.,"Orange County, CA",742,348,660,2.0,6/13/2016,"came here for a graduation lunch with 15 people.  We brought in our own champagne bottles  & each time the waiter opened it, would go all over the floor & get on my friends.  ordered a Caribbean cooler & it was so sweet , no alcohol whatsoever... when I addressed it to the waiter he just said if I want another shot in it, but he was gonna charge me.... Fool it wasn't weak, it just had absolutely NO alcohol in it. frickken jip me. I also went up to the bar to pay it & told them the same thing, but they totally ignore it & just took my card & pay -____- $12 drink whack. no tip for u.  food : - Kobe burger medium raw = the chef did not know how to cook a Kobe pattie, it was burnt at all the edges + our mushrooms were burnt as well! & they ran out of pickles.... you can't eat a burger without pickles - farfalle with chicken roasted garlic = that was ok, I liked the sun dried tomatoes!  total food coma after, and I barely ate half a pasta & a few bites of a burger. ( I always feel bad when I leave a 1 or 2 star on mom & pop places, but not on chains! they should know & be better for all the money they cashing in)"
Jaden K.,"London, United Kingdom",4,58,10,2.0,8/18/2016,So I love Cheesecake and normally would always give this place a 5 but last night's experience was a total bomb.  I ordered the filet mignon and asked for it to be cooked medium and it came out well done. Ugh.. So I patiently waited for 45 minutes while everyone else in my party finished their dinner. Kind of rude for the staff to just take away my plate and expect me to sit there and watch everyone else around me eat. Finally they brought back the steak (cooked right) and everyone else was already finished with dinner. We were planning on watching a movie afterwards but the delay pretty much ruined our plans for the evening. Total bummer. The least they could have done was comp me for my meal but it's too much to ask for decent service these days.
Kyle R.,"Anaheim, CA",81,18,4,3.0,8/28/2016,"Food was good as usual. However the service was less than desirable. Sat down at 4:30, which as a former server, it is always a questionable time because there's generally a shift change around there between lunch and dinner crew. We waited for our server for almost ten minutes, just as we were about to leave and go to PF Chang's next door we were greeted. We were ready to go, placed our drinks, appetizer and entrees all at once. It took about 5 minutes to get our drinks, and another 10 to get cold bread. Our plates had dried lettuce on them from the guest before. A minute after our drinks got dropped off we were introduced to a new server that would be taking over (I was right, they were switching)... She was okay, pretty busy. Our entrees came out, we asked the runner about the appetizer, the original server came over and apologized that she had never rung it in. I get it, you're busy and want to go home, I've been in the same position many times.. But don't take it out on your restaurant's guests that we sat down at 4:30 instead of 5:15."
Julie B.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,112,654,4.0,2/2/2016,"I am a Cheesecake Factory veteran, and come here on occasion for business trips. I feel like this location has better quality food than the ones in San Diego and LA. (Broccoli is a fresh green, noodles are well-cooked, and the avocado eggrolls are crispy and moist.) A shoutout especially for their wait staff. Recently, Araceli waited on my party. She was attentive, thoughtful, and patient with our various questions and substitution requests. She also was pleasant and rallied some other servers to wish my friend's son a happy birthday. Such a great experience!"
Christy K.,"Irvine, CA",528,354,116,4.0,9/30/2015,"TIP: If you arrive during busy hours and have a small party, try the bar area. There are stools at the bar itself, as well as high top tables that can comfortably fit 3-4 people. Our group of 3 was able to find a bar table immediately on a Saturday night, when they had told us the wait would be around 30 min for a table in the normal dining area.  We were quickly approached for drink and food orders. I'll admit that I haven't been to Cheesecake factory in quite a while, but do remember my favorite dish- Pasta Da Vinci. Sadly, it's not my favorite dish anymore. It was way creamier and oiler than I recall it being and didn't have quite enough mushrooms and chicken. It wasn't a bad dish, but not one that I'll be keeping on my favorites list. My co workers appeared to really enjoy their meals- cajun pasta and tuna tartare appetizers! The strawberry cheesecake was also amazing and just as good as I recall. Overall my experience was still good and I'm open to coming back in the future and finding a new favorite dish here!"
Stevie B.,"Miami, FL",2,156,180,2.0,12/26/2015,"Ordered 2 salads - grilled chicken tostada and the BBQ chicken salad via DoorDash. When ordering delivery, quality will likely be less than when served in the restaurant. But that is expected and accepted. The driver picked up both salads at 6:01 and delivered by 6:11. As usual they were on time and professional. Togo packaging and presentation was fantastic. Unfortunately the chicken on both salads was burnt beyond recognition. Not just dry but severely burnt, inedible. Ruined both salads, and our Saturday evening especially when total bill was $47.00. Disappointing :("
