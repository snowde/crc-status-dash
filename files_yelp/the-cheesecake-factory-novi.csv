Theirishpoo T.,"Howell, MI",1,5,,3.0,1/2/2018,"I haven't eaten there in years and always had wonderful food and service. This particular time I did not. It was so bad the customer next to me commented and told me how bad the service was feeling sorry for me. I had my three year old with me, he forgot to bring his chocolate milk. Never saw the waiter for long periods. Waited so long, asked other servers for water, coffee, chocolate milk. Our waiter was nowhere to be found. I was frustrated and then they bring my salad without dressing. No waiter around to help me. I stopped eating the salad and waited to get someone's attention but no one was around. Our waiter, finally,  came so I asked him for dressing and waited even longer for the dressing to arrive. I wanted to just leave that's how frustrated I was. It took an HOUR and FORTY FIVE MINUTES to eat a small lunch with my child. Service was horrible. I spoke to the manager about it and so he knew why I only tipped $5. That was too high but I am a kind person.  I will NEVER eat there nor recommend this place again. They all have their heads up their $**!!!"
Evan Z.,"Florissant, MO",167,3,,1.0,12/28/2017,"Called ahead to let them know we had a party of 10 at 9pm, 2 hours before closing. They rudely informed us they would not accommodate us due to our party being far too large and too close to closing stating there was ""nothing they could do..."" Consistently terrible service and customer care. Please avoid this place at all costs."
Jennifer T.,"South Lyon, MI",28,171,297,3.0,11/7/2017,"I've been to various Cheesecake Factories in several states. How have I not reviewed yet I'm asking myself? No idea, I thought I had. I used to love going out of town and being able to visit. Now there's one in my own State yet I hardly go. Stopped in tonight since we were busy running errands. Food was good when we finally got our correct meals. My husband's Burger was overcooked, they were out of my Salmon so I had to order something else. Then come to find out they weren't out of the Salmon so I ended up getting it about ten minutes after my husband received his meal which he then had to send back. On to the rest though. The menu is extensive! Give yourself time to peruse. There literally is something for everyone. If you can't find something here I'm not even sure what to say. Of course there is dessert(cheesecake) hence the name. And they are good, big slices and tons of different varieties. My favorite is the Banana Cream.   They have a great menu with healthy alternatives and the nutrition calculated called the Skinnylicious menu, it's the menu I stick with. Their Tuscan Chicken with Tomatoes, Artichokes, Capers and Balsamic is a favorite I also love the Salmon. For appetizers I love the summer rolls and the Thai lettuce wraps are​ good. They have happy hour from 4-6 with food choices as well as drink specials. I like the Artichoke if they don't burn them which sometimes they do. Service tends to be on the slower side so be prepared and there is usually a wait."
Robert P.,"Detroit, MI",308,136,1506,4.0,10/2/2017,"I went here to celebrate with a friend and I'm glad I did. We were on a budget and only had $25 bucks to spend between the 2 of us. I know tall order for Cheesecake Factory. But we did it!  We ordered the chicken carbonara to split (they don't split in back since it messes with the presentation but they'll bring you a plate to share). The chicken carbonara is pasta in a cream sauce with pancetta, peas, peppered chicken onion and garlic. The portion was more than big enough for the 2 of us.  For dessert we had the chocolate decadence that is the Godiva chocolate cheese cake. It's got a chocolate crust, chocolate cheesecake filling topped with whipped cream, chocolate drizzle and a Godiva chocolate piece. That they were able to divide for us.  Our server Christine B was excellent she really made the evening special."
Cherie S.,"Canton, MI",7,64,40,4.0,12/13/2017,"We went here for my daughter's 15th birthday.  Although, not my first time, it is my first review and I must say I am always pleased when I come here.  Our server was very nice and attentive.  Made sure our drinks were always full and that we were good.  The food came out hot and delicious.  It is a very very busy time of the year so it took the food a long time to.come out bit they give you bread so you are not starving.  Overall very good experience and the food is phenomenal."
Corey W.,"Charleston, SC",69,54,131,4.0,9/22/2017,"I LOVE the Cheesecake Factory! When you're not sure what to have, or are REALLY hungry, this is the place to go for sure. The portions are huge, and the food is great. Prices are reasonable as well. If you're fortunate enough to go when there is little or no wait, you best be countin your blessings! It's quite often for them to have a 45 min wait, so pack your patience! If, and I mean this is a big ""if"" you saved room for desert, their cheesecakes are phenomenal! So many different variety, and such great quality! Even the bread that is served while waiting is excellent. My favorite is the wheat. Their chicken Madeira is one of they signature dishes, as is the crispy chicken costelleta. Both are fantastic choices. If you want a salad, the bbq ranch salad is to die for!  The staff is always friendly and efficient, and the food is great! I hope you enjoy, and go often! Be sure to try different things on the menu. The crispy artichoke appetizer, ans the avocado spring rolls are just excellent!  Enjoy!"
Renee R.,"Highland Park, MI",0,6,8,5.0,1/5/2018,The food and service made the 45 minute wait worth it! Coldest day of the year so far but this place was packed! Shrimp Jambalaya and Red Velvet Cheesecake! Yumm so good! Our server Christopher was bomb! I sucked down 4 glasses of water and he never left it empty! Fun!
Ryan H.,"Dearborn, MI",48,79,49,3.0,11/12/2017,"I feel like this place has gone down in quality after being open for a couple years, I had the lunch portion salmon and it was OK nothing more. the prices just don't go with what is being put out on the table I mean don't get me wrong the cheesecakes are worth every penny but the food quality and presentation has dramatically changed but yet the prices are still the same. And they took off my favorite appetizer off the menu which was the sushi roll. But it comes to the fact that I would only go here for lunch now if I absolutely had too. Other than that I'll stick to taking a cheesecake to go!"
Corey H.,"Detroit, MI",12,87,334,4.0,9/2/2017,"I've come here several times. The cheesecake is always awesome. It's amazing how they can successfully be a jack of all trades when it comes to the menu. The menu is huge and all Over the food spectrum but they do everything well for the most part. The service is also very good for the most part, there have been some frowning moments. But this is an overall review.  Their portions are also huge and the food is very rich but what do you expect from a factory that specializes in cheesecakes. There is a skinny menu which is also very good but this ain't it place for u if you're on a diet, unless it's your cheat day."
Amy C.,"Grosse Pointe, MI",9,29,9,1.0,11/3/2017,"I'll start out on a positive note. The cheesecakes are phenomenal, especially the Oreo Xtreme one. However.... My husband and I have ordered the same thing for the last 3 years: the BBQ chicken salad.  Every time we go, the salad quality diminishes significantly. For example, they used to put a ton of chicken, corn, black beans, etc. on the salad. Now, they put such little portions of each that it tastes like I'm eating purely lettuce.  Just to put it in perspective, we used to drive 45 minutes just to get this salad as ""take out"" because we liked it so much. Now, we don't even consider going here anymore.  Overall, the food quality has steadily declined. It really is a shame."
Dawn V.,"Bloomfield Township, MI",88,464,232,4.0,10/11/2017,"I have to say, if you're coming for cheesecake or drinks, who's is actually NOT your spot.  The cheesecake of local favorite, Peteet's, is so far above the quality here and chains always have terrible bartenders, HOWEVER: If you're looking for a healthy, light and quick lunch, this is it.  The salads are amazing.  I ordered the kale and quinoa and my friend ordered a chicken oriental that came out towering with crisps.  Both were really really good and salads aren't actually easy to impress with.  Lots of attention to detail. The margarita was less than average and the plain cheesecake and the celebration cheesecake were actually not so good.  Not any of these three were even half consumed."
Lauren P.,"Fenton, MI",77,29,2,4.0,12/9/2017,"I went here for my birthday and it was amazing. Every single thing we ordered was amazing. There was a really long wait, but I think it was worth it! Will definitely go back!"
Elina D.,"Walled Lake, MI",39,182,379,1.0,5/31/2017,"I'm not a fan of Cheesecake Factory, and this location is pretty bad. The dishes are super heavy and everything is pretty much super sized. When friends want to visit, I do stick to a few salads that I know I won't mind. But it's not so much about the food, as it is the service.  The service is so inconsistent. This is pretty much the only place where I have actually left a zero tip.  And I could guarantee, it's not because they were understaffed. They always have so many employees, but half of them move like molasses and the others are just rude. One time, I was leaving the table and a server who wasn't carrying any dishes, just body checked me for no reason. The guests always have the right away, but the server didn't think to seem so or just didn't care.  I avoid this place whenever possible."
Lawrence S.,"Saint Clair Shores, MI",16,13,,5.0,1/5/2018,"Normally I won't go to chain restaurants but this place is out of this world and I don't even like cheesecake. I have been to various locations (Chicago, Columbus,Orlando,Novi) and each time the food is outstanding. The menu is so big( it can be overwhelming) you could eat a different entree daily for months and never have the same thing. Mixed drinks such as the blood orange mojito and cucumber mojito are excellent. Long waits are normal but understandable because it's worth the wait. Highly recommend and don't let the long wait scare you away."
Alexa M.,"Farmington, MI",110,18,26,3.0,1/10/2018,"Good food. HUGE portion sizes. If you are trying to eat healthy this place is not for you. It's also annoying that they don't take reservations, there's always people waiting I really think they should change this. It's always crazy busy, overall good place. It's one of those places you go every once in a while then you're good for another year or so. I live right by the place I feel like if they took reservations a lot of people I know would go more often, because nobody really has time to wait hours to eat. It's not like they need the business anyways, the place is always packed. Great cheesecake!"
Gloria R.,"Farmington, MI",0,1,,5.0,1/5/2018,"The Salmon Special is awesome with capers, mushrooms, and a lemon butter sauce. The Red Velvet cheesecake is my favorite!"
Victoria M.,"Novi, MI",0,16,5,5.0,12/14/2017,"I come here to relax and enjoy a meal full of drinks and appetizers. Unfortunately the only thing is, they dont take reservations, so plan on waiting for 15 minutes or so. Other than that the atmosphere and drinks are enough to make you unwind. My server was Jasmine tonight, she did a wonderful job at accommodating my table. Our drinks came fast and by the time I got my food I was smiling from ear to ear. The steak Diane and Chicken combination was and is always fantastic. Dont skip out on the cheesecake, dont be a fool! Cheesecake Factory in Novi, BRINGS IT ALL to the table."
Mariah H.,"Oakland, MI",20,112,6,4.0,8/26/2017,"Stopped in for dinner this past Friday, which ultimately led to the updating of my previous review.  In my former CF experiences, the wait was long, the food was so so and the service was always decent. And for the strangest reason, nothing off of that gigantic menu ever seemed to sit well in my stomach.  This Friday, I met up with some girlfriends and was looking forward to a great night. For starters, the wait was finally reasonable! 30 minutes for a Friday night. Huge contrast to the one and two hour waits that used to be the norm.  For starters, I ordered the fried Mac and cheese and for my entree I had the southwest chicken sandwich (not sure if that's the actual name but you get the gist lol).  We were so caught up in conversation that I never realized my appetizer never came out and suddenly our entrees began to appear. Our server (I want to say her name was Mandy) came and asked if I ever got it - apparently there was a mix up in the kitchen but they offered the app to me on the house! Who doesn't love FREE fried cheese! I'm all in. My sandwich was good, I REALLY enjoyed my salad. I think it might've been the balsamic dressing...but whatever it was it was the bomb. Fried Mac was also good as well. Fast forward to the end of the night, I noticed my app wasn't taken off the bill, and of course I had to overthink myself into wanting to make a big fuss on a busy Friday....so I didn't say anything. It's the thought that counts right? I assumed she must've put everything in as we ordered and forgot to comp it maybe? Either way I appreciated the effort to make things right - my fault for not opening my mouth to do anything but shovel more fried cheese into my face!  Rounded everything out with raspberry lemon cheesecake, which is proving to be my favorite cheesecake that they offer. AND to top it all off, no stomachache! I couldn't believe it. All in all, successful night out! Food was good, service was great, deserving of an updated review. I'll be back again!"
Ron S.,"Warren, MI",0,20,,1.0,1/1/2018,Don't bother coming here. The wait is over an hour and they are routinely out of like 75% of items on their menu. I drove an hour to get here only to be told almost everything  on their menu is sold out. The person responsible for ordering stock should be fired
Lou S.,"Oakland, MI",3,24,10,3.0,11/2/2017,"I usually only wrist great reviews, not this time. This is one of my favorite Restaurants, but this time was different. The server was not good very indifferent could care less.  Did not serve food as it was ordered.  My friend ordered a hamburger with no Mayo, they took it back, and it not return to the table the server said she was checking on it  Well it did come after we had desert  By the way the restroom was a disgrace"
Matthew P.,"Northville, MI",24,339,769,2.0,6/25/2017,"Pretty depressing brunch to be honest. The food was just meh at best; did a build your own omelette (goat cheese, mushroom, spinach, bacon). My omelette must have had maybe a teaspoon of goat cheese down at one end (probably a 7"" omelette in length), spinach was 'crispy', not sure what happened there, and bacon was tough and chewy and the size of bacon bits.  My lady friend had the huevos rancheros and that wasn't a bad dish, although extremely heavy on the black beans."
Ernie M.,"Northville, MI",42,395,58,3.0,7/25/2017,"Menus  so large it is difficult to digest. That can be good and bad. the good was that one of the interesting appetizers was fried artichokes, the bad was they said they were unavailable because they were out of season---???in July???. But, I stayed with the ""skinny"" menu and got the shrimp summer rolls and the crispy crab bites. Both were very tasty and fairly low in calories and carbs. They both came with some excellent sauces. My wife had the beet/goat cheese salad followed by the white chicken chili. I tasted both---the beets were terrific, but I thought the chicken in the chili was a little tough and it could have been a little spicier. Then comes the cheesecake----delicious and worth the visit---any of the varieties. Service by Antanesha was perfect"
Jay R.,"West Bloomfield Township, MI",13,200,265,1.0,6/1/2017,"I have to say, growing up going to Cheesecake Factory in Florida was the most exciting thing ever for me.. I am very aware the issues the CEO has with Michigan and why he chose not to open up here for so long. My aunt actually went to school with him so I know the story all too well.  When I had heard this location opened up, I was ready to become a regular. I never imagined that I would have such a bad taste in my mouth about Cheesecake Factory as I do today... All of the corporate cut backs have left menu items tasting lousy. Nothing like the quality they used to have.  On another note, the staff are so rude and miserable, you can tell they hate every second of their jobs. The service is so bad every time I have visited, which is why I rarely come back. Maybe if the food was the way it used to be, I would come more often despite the bad service."
L V.,"Novi, MI",0,11,,5.0,1/6/2018,Large menu with nice variety! Never had a bad meal here.  Service is great and love the atmosphere.  Cant say a negative thing.
Dave A.,"Allen Park, MI",76,16,9,2.0,8/18/2017,My fiance and I were excited to come here with our 9 month old baby. My kid loved the mashed potatoes and my fiancé got the chicken Madeira which was amazing as well. I myself got Sheppards pie which was very good.  Well halfway through my meal i looked over and there was a bug on the table. I don't know how long it was there for but my awesome waitress called someone over to clean it up. Her name was Stephanie and she did an amazing job!  However; as bad as the bug situation was I kind of looked past it. The icing on the cake where it went bad was when the gentleman wiped it off the table and lifted it OVER the top of my plate. I am not one to get someone in trouble so i stopped eating immediately and had my waitress box up my food to be nice and pretend nothing happened. When a different waitress walked by I asked her to discard the food and just get rid of it.  The food was great don't get me wrong. This was just a bad experience for our first time here. We also got Chris's cheesecake which was incredible. I just don't want this review to turn away people because one man made a mistake.
Harry M.,"Laval, Canada",4,18,2,1.0,12/13/2017,My dining experience was very sub par a few days ago. From the minute was I was sat down to my table the hostess informed me not to move my table the half inch I did because for some reason I couldn't understand and while I was explaining the move was necessary for my rear to not sit on the crack of their cushions she wouldn't listen to the manager showing no empathy when I explained my concerned on their calamari plate was 75% batter then actual calamari. Only reason I give it 1 star is because I like their food but the rest of the experience isn't worth shit
Rose M.,"Detroit, MI",1240,229,635,3.0,10/27/2016,"Came to celebrate my birthday one night and the wait was over an hour. Decided to try again and it was closer to 45 minutes on a Friday night, which was surprising. I've been to Cheesecake Factories all over the US and I have to say this was my least favorite. The layout was a little different then most I've been too, and it seemed they crammed as many tables as possible so any type of personal space is void.  Our server was nice and knowledgeable. We started with the spinach artichoke appetizer and a glass of sangria and a blood orange margarita. Both drinks we good but the glass was jammed with ice of course. For as much as they charge you can let up a little. The appetizer was okay, I should have gone with something else.  I ordered the blackened Jamaican chicken and shrimp which wasn't too bad, I have to say it was well cooked. The beau ordered the Chicken Madeira and Steak combo with mashed potatoes. Not the best we've had but it wasn't bad. Of course most come for the cheesecake. I took the pumpkin pecan and he got the godiva to go.  Overall the bill was close to $100 for two and with the amount of food you do get combined with drinks and dessert I'd say is average."
Bren B.,"Windsor, Canada",0,11,,1.0,10/4/2017,"This place used to be great when it first opened. Last few experiences have been disappointing to say the least. Insanely slow service (1+ hour wait for food when the restaurant is nearly empty). The general manager is extremely patronizing and rude. Not sure how this guy became a manager in the service industry but it definitely wasn't due to his customer service skills. They also don't take reservations - I'm sure this is a corporate policy but to tell people that you cannot make a reservation for a large group coming from out of town is absurd.  There should always be exceptions to the rule for these situations, as many other restaurants have. Instead the policy is ""you and your 8 guests will have to drive two hours and then stand in line for 4 more hours to eat - because we hate people using our establishment for special occasions and don't want your business."" This place will survive on the reputation that other locations built and nothing more. This location is tarnishing the Cheesecake Factory brand. Very unfortunate."
Rene B.,"Marine City, MI",35,66,79,5.0,10/9/2017,"This was my second visit to the Cheesecake Factory. It's a busy place and always crowded, so I suggest you plan to wait when you go, but it's worth the wait! First of all the menu has 21 pages! Needless to say it has many varieties of food from appetizers to salads to entrées of all nationalities. I had the baked potato soup and the Tomato Basil Pasta for my entrée. Both were excellent. The bread basket was filled with French and pumpernickel bread which was divine. Unfortunately, we didn't have room for dessert, although we had thoughts about coming back later to get cheesecake to take home, but we'll save that for another day. We'll definitely go back and try one of the many other menu items."
Raquel T.,"Utica, MI",48,145,379,5.0,5/6/2017,"This was my first time at The Cheesecake Factory and I loved it! I sat at the bar and was taken care of by Nick the bartender. Service was great and friendly. I ordered a blood orange martini which was perfectly sweet. For my meal I ordered the chicken and shrimp gumbo which was fantastic. It was perfectly spicy and it tasted very fresh. The bread basket here is great as well, two different loaves of what they call Sweet Wheat and Oat Demi Baguette. I ordered three slices of cheesecake to take home and share with the family-Oreo, tuxedo, and my absolute favorite-white chocolate Raspberry. Everything was great from the food, to the drinks, to the service. The restaurant has a slightly elegant vibe to it as well. Excellent place, I'll be back again."
Jasmine B.,"Detroit, MI",60,48,134,3.0,8/25/2017,This has been my second time coming to the Cheesecake Factory. Both times have been an amazing experience. Starting with the wait staff. They are very attentive to your needs. Today I order the side house salad with cheese on top and Steak Diane with mash potatoes. I order it med. It came back med well. Other wise other problems. I will come back again as long as the cook watch the temp of the meat.
Darryl K.,"Vaughan, Canada",0,170,47,3.0,12/29/2017,"Nice setting and good service. Had a veggie burger, beef burger and Alfredo pasta with chicken. Everything was just average."
Vince S.,"New Hudson, MI",2,85,,1.0,9/3/2017,Save your money and go to a restaurant that knows how to serve food and take care of customers  We were a party of four and all agree we will not return
G I N.,"Macomb, MI",6,127,1183,3.0,5/12/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory is a well known franchise with locations in several states. Famous for their Cheesecakes, the restaurant also boasts over 250 menu items from appetizers and salads to pizza, pasta, sandwiches, and steak, you'll be sure to find something that you're craving. But if you're boasting about a 250+ menu selection, it's most likely many variations of a core dish. Either that or the Chef has a serious repertoire, no, an arsenal of mad skills. After perusing the menu, I've concluded that it was the former not the latter. With over 40 types of cheesecake alone, dessert easily makes up 20% of the menu.  The only location in MI is at Twelve Oaks Mall in Novi. It's been there for a few years now (Nov. 2013), and the place is still insanely packed. They do not take reservations so it's first come first serve. Wait times faltered slightly and you're looking at about 2,5 hrs wait during peak times. Do yourself a favour and avoid the peak period, you'll get a table fairly easy (30-45 mins tops). If you don't mind having ""Linner"", go between 14:00-16:00 and you'll be seated relatively quick. The semi good news is that you can walk around the mall for a bit, but don't go for too long, the buzzer is really a short range device, covering 300 feet if you're lucky. That'll get you as far as the unmanned information booth. Walk the mall, just come back 15 mins or so before your appointed wait time is over. Crispy Crab Bites. These deep fried mouth-size balls were surprisingly better than anticipated. The breading did not absorb too much oil and the filling did consist of actual crab. Ratio between crab and filler was about 50/50. The dipping sauce was a creamy mustard-based sauce that didn't have any signs of spice to it so it's even safe for kids. A pleasant surprise. 4,0 stars. Ahi Tartare. Sashimi grade tuna atop an avacado base topped with a blossom of ginger, accompanied by crispy wonton wrappers. The sauce is your traditional soy, vinegar, ginger mix garnished with cilantro. The vinegar taste was super light, with little to no acidity. The portion was a little lacking even for one, but it tasted as good as it looked. 4,0 stars. BBQ Ranch Chicken Salad. This salad is ginormous! Easily feeding 4, the salad comes deconstructed so it's great for sharing as you can build it your way on your own plate. Visually it's appealing with romaine, black beans, corn, cucumber, tomato, avocado, diced chicken, and crispy fried onion strings topping the dish. The romaine lettuce was fresh and crisp, and the dressing is a combination of BBQ and Ranch. While it doesn't sound like a good combination, it fared decently when everything was tossed together. 3,5 stars Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp. Served with rice, beans, plantains, and pineapple. The shrimp were a decent size (31-40 ct), and the dish did carry some heat. The marinated pineapple, and the plantains were a good complement with the sweetness offsetting the spice from the shrimp. The rice was long grain and not overcooked. 3,0 stars Pasta Carbonara. I added chicken to this dish for protein (+$3). Smoked bacon & green peas were the only other ingredients on this simple dish. The sauce was a garlic parmesan cream. When it arrived, it was still warm, but looked like it was under the lamps a bit as the pasta was drying out. Aged Parmagiana shavings would have been a nice garnish, despite fresh parmesan being used for the sauce. 3,0 stars.  Known for their cheesecakes, they did not disappoint. While the specialty toppings and ingredients did add elements of flavour and texture to the dish as a whole, they also contributed greatly to blood sugar levels and calories.  Reese's Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake Cheesecake. 3,0 stars. Oreo Dream Extreme Cheesecake. 3,0 stars. Chris' Outrageous Cheesecake. 3,5 stars. Plain Cheesecake: 4,5 stars. Overall, I'd probably rate Cheesecake factory 3,5 stars. They definitely have a range of ratings based on the course, with Apps and Desserts faring better than their entrees. But adding the value factor and wait times would result in rounding down rather than up. Overall, the prices are on the high end for what you get. The wait times are seldomly short, which does nothing to help its plight. 3,0 stars. Tip: Place your dessert order 20-30 mins before the end of your meal as the Dessert Cafe also handles all take out orders and gets backed up."
Chad H.,"Kalamazoo, MI",8,119,51,1.0,3/14/2017,"Note: I did not eat in the restaurant; This review is only for the cheesecakes to go - which I got on 3 occasions, and each time was worse than the last. The very last time was the last straw.  The inside looked pretty nice and the food displayed on the T.V.s looked really good, but I was only there to quickly pick up a cheesecake. I wish I could eat there, but it would be impossible without reservations. I went there 3 times and each time was a 40 minute wait (Sunday Nights each time) to stand in a line and get it, but I don't get why the wait was so long! You asked for the cheesecake, you pay for the cheesecake, why did each person take 5 minutes? I get that you're busy but when you have a specific counter for cheesecakes, you'd would expect the service could be faster. Onto the cheesecakes, I got a pumpkin (pretty good), a traditional (fine), and a chocolate(terrible), in that order. When you're paying 25-30 dollars per cheesecake, you would hope they're pretty good, especially with a name like cheesecake factory but I could make a cheesecake 5x that good for half of the price that they charge.  The chocolate one was by FAR the worst thing I've ever eaten. I drove home to Kalamazoo from Detroit. I gave it a 3 hour defrost time, and when my friends started to unbox it- the box literally CRUMBLED because it was SO freezer-burnt that the box was eroding and it literally was crumbling apart as we tried opening it, like some frosty relic.  The chocolate cheesecake itself was still covered with frost after a 3 hour drive in a warm car. You could tell that it was in deep freeze, because it was even sweaty from de-thawing but still had so much that a mountain of freezerburn-frost still remained. The cheesecake was very dry and crumbly and it wasn't even that chocolaty. It was hard, dry, and tasted like dust. The other 2 cheesecakes were okay, but nothing special. They didn't look nearly as good as the pictures as they varied with toppings. They were significantly less freezer burnt, but still had that essence to them. They were only half a step up from a frozen grocery store cheesecake. The one thing I can thank Cheesecake factory for is inspiring me to bake my own cheesecakes from now on. They're cheaper, faster, and taste a whole lot better and fresher."
Alex D.,"Waterford charter Township, MI",24,26,2,3.0,12/3/2017,"This Cheesecake Factory location is decent. The food is pretty good. The service is so-so in the restaurant area. The service is great in the bar area, especially during lunch hours, 11am-2pm. Main problem is during dinner hours there is always a 1-2 hour wait to be seated. It's ridiculous. Other than that, decent place."
Jessica L.,"Sterling Heights, MI",231,47,52,3.0,4/10/2017,"Okay let me start by saying, no I haven't tried their actual food, but I did order some cheesecake to go, and although the cheesecake is amazing! Original and red velvet!  The thing I didnt like about this place, was not only how crazy and hectic it was, but how unorganized it was, I had to wait almost an hour for my cheesecake and while waiting I was being smooched by random stranger also waiting for their cheesecake. So even though their cheesecake was good I dont know if it was worth waiting in that crammed space and almost an hour for."
Rae B.,"Oak Park, MI",0,5,,1.0,10/23/2017,"This place used to be great but the last few experiences have been HORRIBLE!!!!!! The most recent disastrous experience was this past Sunday 10/23/17.  After a 40-45 minute wait we were seated and placed our order immediately after sitting to avoid waiting longer to eat. After placing our order the server comes back to say they were out of steak!!!! After waiting maybe 5 or more minutes for her to come back we were able to place another order. After waiting almost an hour for two entrees to be served I never got a chance to eat. I was served under cooked meat!!! The other entree that was served was room temperature. How do you take an hour to prepare and serve raw cold food?  Mind you while waiting this additional time for dinner not once did the server check on our table. After flagging down the server I was told she would have the manager address the issue.   The manager is a whole different issue in itself with the place.  This guy has no customer service skills and little to no social skills. He was very monotone when addressing the issues. There was barley an apology or any type of offer to make things right. I finally had to say that we will not pay for the meals due to the unacceptable service that was received and we left. As we were walking away he then decided to make a comment and say ""oh I wouldn't expect you to pay for this""? I decided to keep walk-in and not address this person you all have decided was a qualified manager for your establishment.   For the prices you charge for your food the service should match. There is no justification for your employees lack of customer skills especially when it come to your management. This is the second time I have had a horrible experience here and have had to address your lack luster management regarding the crappy service. And to top it all off there was a bug running around the floor and I'm sure you know what I mean! When it was brought to the manager attention as well he expressed no concern regarding that either. By taking a look at some of the other reviews on here I'm not the only customer who has noticed the bug problem in this place!!!"
L W.,"Farmington, MI",0,31,1,3.0,11/26/2017,"Interesting menu selection. Potions are huge. Lots of options from seafood, pasta, burgers, salads, etc... unfortunately I find every dish here to be calorie laden. They do offer a lighter fare menu but I found those options to be greasy as well. I also received a free piece of cheesecake (happened to be national cheesecake day) and found it to be awful. Truthfully the worst cheesecake I've ever had. Cheesecake Factory isn't bad but it's not good either. It's a mediocre restaurant that relies on fat to make food taste good. I wouldn't not eat here but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here either."
Mary S.,"Farmington, MI",9,73,136,2.0,8/6/2017,"Service is good. Some of the food is ok. Stick to their appetizers, sandwiches, salads. Buffalo wings are good. The grilled pork chop is good. Basically, this place is a nicer looking restaurant than Applebee's but comes with Cheesecake. It's just ""ok"". We were here when they first opened (after enjoying the one in Vegas) but this time only went because we had gift card. Next time, we'll re-gift the card"
