Amber W.,"Detroit, MI",0,13,20,4.0,1/17/2016,"I spent my 4th time at this restaurant just yesterday for my Mom's birthday. I've had the chicken madera, the chicken Marsala, avocado eggrolls, crab wontons, Mexican chicken lettuce wraps, The Steak Diane, and more food that I can even remember. Needless to say it's worth the wait. Of course the earlier you go, the shorter the wait. The wait staff is always great and the atmosphere is beautiful! I love this restaurant and I will continue to frequent here! The cheesecake is AMAZING and each visit I tried a different type. They all were excellent!!!!"
Tyrellie S.,"Detroit, MI",58,10,,3.0,8/3/2017,The only reason I gave them 3 stars is for the Cheesecake only. I swear I believe the owner of this place simply hired the worst of the worst workers who simply have no sense of customer service. The place seems nice when you walk in but the display case was old looking and wore out. The young lady behind the Cheesecake pick up and go counter was dry as ever I mean I could go on. This is my second visit to this establishment and I refuse to go back unless someone goes in for me. The first time I was kicked out because the manager refused to add 3 guest to my table or even seat them near us. He was very rude so I gave him a mouth full. After reading and hearing about the horrible experiences of food poisoning I will never eat food from here. FYI this is not DETROIT this is 45 minutes away from DETROIT. I've been to places in the city that had way more friendlier staffed people. This place simply need a person to come in and turn it around or they will be out of business soon. Hey hire me I'll fix the hospitality in this place
Ornella B.,"Novi, MI",14,115,14,3.0,9/1/2015,"My sweet mother in law brought me lunch and I was disappointed. I had the chicken scampi pasta and when it arrived in the takeout box, it did not look appetizing. The pasta was not all coated with sauce and the chicken were the end pieces of the breast so very fatty and dry..bummer!! Overall, it was okay and probably not something I'll get again."
Carly B.,"Chicago, IL",7,62,5,2.0,6/12/2015,"Food wise, The Cheesecake Factory never disappoints. It doesn't matter where you are. The experience however from location to location is much more variable. This location lost major points on a few fronts: Firstly, they were out of all burgers, turkey, salmon and a few other items on the menu. Seriously, that's almost half the menu?!?! Um, okay... Secondly, while it's great that there was outdoor seating, whenever the wind blew in a certain direction, we were overwhelmed by a pungent garbage smell. No exactly appetizing. Lastly, the service was underwhelming. I hope given everything else that we were just there on an ""off"" night, but it took a while for our server to take our order, bring our order, refill beverages, etc. The poor man looked ready to call it a day and just quit on the spot.  Overall, I think next time I'm in the mood for some Cheesecake Factory and in the area, I'll call my order in ahead of time and do it as take-out."
Elisha C.,"Detroit, MI",62,28,,5.0,7/11/2016,"Absolutely love Cheesecake Factory. The Baltimore Harbor one is my favs and I am so excited they opened one in Novi, MI as for the midwest to indulge. Kudos :)"
Rachael M.,"Waterford Township, MI",5,28,9,1.0,5/13/2016,"Went here for the first time with a friend and we will NOT be back! We got seated rather quickly on the patio, but we waited over 40 minutes to place our order, then we waited another 35 minutes to get out food. We both ordered the skinnylicious fresh veggie salad with dressing on the side- not exactly complicated to prepare- we didn't get our dressing, so we had to wait another 15 minutes to for that be delivered by which time we were both almost done with our salads. The food was ok- definitely not worth the hype or the high prices. The waitress never bothered to stop by to ask how our food was or if we needed anything. The service was terrible, the food was ok, but not worth it. We won't be back- ever."
Abby S.,"Novi, MI",531,3,,3.0,8/13/2016,"The chocolate cake was amazing. We had a two hour wait, but walked the mall while we waited. The music was unbearably loud. We had to shout to have any kind of conversation. Food took a long time."
Amy M.,"Carmel, IN",201,29,4,2.0,4/1/2016,I'm not even going to mention the wait to sit down because that's to be expected. What I will mention is the wait for our food - which I can understand to a certain point. But what was aggravating was that the food was luke warm when we got it. So we waited all that time and our food was just sitting their under a heat lamp while our waitress did who knows what. Our waitress was slow for everyone in our section and didn't refill drinks or bring out appetizers and entrees at the right time. And when we finally got our food it was greasy as heck! It was not worth the money they were asking and it definitely wasn't worth the wait. We have gone to this location four or five times and it's been heading in a downward direction each time. We will not be going back.
Greg M.,"Farmington, MI",0,9,,1.0,8/16/2015,"1. Need training on how to treat people. 2. Need to smile at their customer. 3. Need to make sure that they smile and say hello. 4. This is a multi billion dollar company and they should have a multi billion dollar customer service. The african-american female ""greeter"" did not smile once, even after my senior citizen mother said ""i want to see a smile!"" The girl looked like we were bothering her, and appeared like she did not want to be there.  For God sakes find another job besides customer service GREETER if you can't even crack a smile for my family when we're going to spend over $150 on dinner for my senior citizen mom's birthday. We watched this girl walk people to their table the entire night, and she never once cracked a smile or said ""thank you"" or ""please."" Just ATTITUDE!  Also, no free cheesecake slice on your birthday is disappointing. There were flies everywhere. My shrimp alfredo was the worst meal I've ever had in my life, with barely any shrimp. The little shrimp I did have were way over-cooked and rubbery. We waited over an hour to be seated on a Sunday evening, and It was way too hot. The air conditioning should have been set at least 10 degrees colder. Our waiter was sweaty."
Lawrence W.,"Novi, MI",119,50,15,2.0,5/1/2016,"I've been hearing about Cheesecake Factory for a few years now. Up to the point where when I heard that they were coming to Novi, I was JACKED to go. A friend of mine invited me and my wife to go with his family to eat dinner there. I ordered the Everything Pizza and it was just okay. I ordered the plain cheesecake and it was just ok. And I'm ok that the food didn't WOW me. But the prices were much to high for such mediocre food. 4/10 tops."
TJ K.,"Cleveland Heights, OH",37,73,,4.0,6/24/2016,We sat outside and it was very nice and comfortable. Unfortunately our food was quite late and even though we never said anything the manager did come over and let us know he was aware. I got the mushroom burger and it was delicious and topped it off with a large piece of delectable Linda's chocolate cake. You must try it.
Gary S.,"Nolensville, TN",46,166,17,4.0,6/22/2015,"Cheesecake Factory may be overrated or cliche, but the portions are always huge, the service is friendly, and the atmosphere is upscale. I've had varied luck with the food though. Some items have been great, like the salads and pastas.  Others have been average at best, like the dry, flavorless chicken salad sandwich I had last time. The Factory is a welcome addition to 12 Oaks. Bring an appetite but be careful with your order."
Jenny K.,"Detroit, MI",310,194,2136,4.0,4/4/2016,"One word to describe The Cheesecake Factory: consistent. I used to eat here all the time when I lived in Chicago and was glad they opened one here. Whenever friends or family would visit, this is where they wanted to go. It's always busy here and our wait is 30 minutes or longer each time. They have an extensive menu of regular and ""skinnylicious"" items. They also have almost two pages worth of cheesecake flavors you can try, hence their namesake and main attraction. In our most recent visit, I ordered a combination plate of the Steak Diane and Chicken Madeira with mashed potatoes. It was a lot of food and tasted great. I ordered the steak medium and had 3 pieces of steak on my plate. There were 2 cooked medium and 1 cooked medium-rare. Our waiter, Michael, took the one piece and had it cooked a bit longer so I could eat while my meal was hot. He was awesome! Attentive, friendly, and offered some great recommendations for both our meals and cheesecake. I ordered the Fresh Banana Cream Cheesecake, which is topped with Bavarian cream and fresh sliced bananas. It wasn't as heavy as other cheesecakes I've had here, such as the chocolate-flavored ones. Those are very rich; delicious, but sweet. Overall, we had a great dining experience. I'm sure we'll be here again soon, especially if we notice it isn't extremely busy when we're in the area. However, I doubt it!"
Jennifer P.,"Taylor, MI",124,57,40,3.0,5/13/2015,"This is my third time to Cheesecake Factory.  I've been to their Cleveland location and to this one twice.  I ordered 2 of their grilled chicken sandwiches (once in Cleveland and also in Novi),  though it's called something more fancy, of course.  Well unfortunately the chicken was bloody,  luckily I'm a ""cut your sandwich in half"" type of person and I noticed it prior to consumption.  The waitresses (yes, it happened TWICE) apologized profusely and removed it from the bills.  Not that it was expected but considering I almost got selmanila poisoning you'd think I'd get a complimentary piece of their name sake. No dice.  Wah! Today's visit, the mac & cheese balls were absolutely positively AMAZING!  Do yourself a favor and order them!  My Husband throughly enjoyed their ""Miso Salmon"" atop rice, he seriously was making 'oralgasm' noises.  Ridiculous. Lol!  My entrée was their cheesesteak sandwich, the bread was super hard and the meat sadly had a weird gooey texture, the highlight was they didn't hold back on the cheese.  The fries...COLD.  Bummer. I love fries! Perhaps I'm just picking badly?? They do have 200 things to pick from afterall.  I don't know but sadly my relationship with CF has been a strained one in the entrée department.  Out of fairness,  I've never had a bad piece of cheesecake. TG or they should rethink the name.  Lol!  Note to all you cheapskates-- you'll be paying $6.95(plain)-$7.95 a slice but as the old saying goes ""you get what you pay for""! My favorites in the cheesecake department is: Carrot cake,  Red Velvet, Godiva, PB Ripple... AMAZING! The service has ALWAYS been amazing, the cheesecake brings me back... and well, my pouting Husband.  Lol!  Be prepared to wait well over an hour for dinner and the weekends are even longer! NO RESERVATIONS!"
Elizabeth L.,"Detroit, MI",152,161,99,5.0,7/23/2014,"Just Amazing! I had a wonderful three thumbs up experience!  On arrival we were told there was an hour wait which we gladly waited. It ended up only being about 35 minutes until we were seated. Server was polite and I had ordered the avocado eggroll appetizer to start and it was to DIE FOR.  If you are an avocado fan, this is one dish you must not pass up. The dipping sauce added wonderful flavor to the app as well. For an entree I ordered the Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta which was delicious. I loved the added vegetables in the pasta such as asparagus, peas and red and yellow peppers. The sauce was creamy and had a slight kick, but full of flavor. My friend ordered the bang bang chicken and shrimp, which she was pleased with. She said it had a stronger curry taste to it, so I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who isn't a curry fan. For dessert I went all out and got the Adam cheesecake which had peanut butter cups, butterfingers and caramel. Absolutely scrumptious. Very rich, but delish. The restaurant was busy, but everything was prompt. The server was on her game with filling up my water glass and clearing unneeded dishes. I will definitely be back if not next week then the following A++"
James M.,"Newport, MI",57,709,347,5.0,9/27/2014,"A 5 star rating on their bistro shrimp pasta alone. ""Would give that stuff 10 stars!!! ""BEST pasta dish EVER!!! Their wedge salad is ""GREAT"" also! I have tried several of their cheesecakes, which I expected to be great,  but we're just OK? Their service is fair, considering how busy this place is, & the wait can be pretty long @ times even lunch. Bistro shrimp pasta keeps me coming back :-))"
Harriet W.,"Salt Lake City, UT",0,4,2,1.0,1/17/2017,"The hosts at this location are awesome. Very efficient and helping to turn tables.  This particular night isn't as busy, and is why I've decided to write this review. I waited for my server to greet me and than another 10 minutes before I asked the manager if I can have a water. Instead of just getting me a water, he first tries to locate the server and by then he's on his way. I can tell the server is irritated that I asked for my water and so he hands the water to the manager. After a few minutes after, he hands me lemons and cold bread. I said thanks. By now, I've lost my appetite. I'm sure he doesn't want to stop by my table and to make matters worst, I just was handed a dirty plate with lemons. He didn't even deliver my food, worst dining experience ever. All because I asked for my water."
Margie L.,"Charter Township of Clinton, MI",96,8,6,2.0,2/22/2016,My boyfriend and I came here for happy hour one evening and the experience was terrible. We got to the host stand and told the hostess we wanted to try out their happy hour and she said it was self seating so we picked a table and never got menus. After about 5 minutes I went to the host stand and asked for a happy hour menu as well as a waitress. 5 minutes later a waitress came over to greet us and was clearly disappointed we were there for happy hour. Almost as if she didn't even want to serve our table. We ordered and she was extremely fake with us and it almost made me feel uncomfortable. The food was great. Big portions and good price. But the service was just terrible.
Evie B.,"Livonia, MI",202,407,51,2.0,4/9/2014,"Inflated prices. $15 for a salad. Yes it was good, but for $15 you can add more than 4oz of chicken... More than a tsp Of sour cream and that green stuff.. The dressing didn't fit the salad . ( chicken tostada) and instead of cilantro, there were several sprigs of parsley .  Lots of corn and diced tomatoes"
Mike T.,"Novi, MI",0,24,2,4.0,6/20/2016,"Hadn't been here in a while but was craving Sweet Tamale Corn Cakes and as usual, The Cheesecake Factory didn't disappoint. A perfect combination with sauce, avocado, tomato and their other ingredients. The Beet and Goat Cheese salad with green apples and pecans was just right followed by the Lemon Raspberry cheesecake. The only reason I am not giving 5-stars this go around is because I had to look around for the server a few times in an otherwise uncrowded bar area. Next time I will try to remember to take pictures of the food as well, they always do a great job with plate presentation."
