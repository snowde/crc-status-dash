Danielle K.,"Farmington Hills, United States",8,4,4,5.0,3/4/2014,I guess it's hard to please cheap people around the area. Let me start off; the food is incredibly good including desert. I've been here twice already and it gets better for me all the time.  Yes there's a wait and yes they don't take reservations but you need to be patient and have to use your head that it's the only Cheesecake Factory in Michigan and other people want to eat there too.  Appetizers: I recommend the fried calamari and the flat bread. It was so good! And for the meal:   with the Samon and mashed potatoes UGH SO GOOD!!!
Victoria M.,"Novi, United States",0,16,5,5.0,14/12/2017,"I come here to relax and enjoy a meal full of drinks and appetizers. Unfortunately the only thing is, they dont take reservations, so plan on waiting for 15 minutes or so. Other than that the atmosphere and drinks are enough to make you unwind. My server was Jasmine tonight, she did a wonderful job at accommodating my table. Our drinks came fast and by the time I got my food I was smiling from ear to ear. The   and Chicken combination was and is always fantastic. Dont skip out on the cheesecake, dont be a fool! Cheesecake Factory in Novi, BRINGS IT ALL to the table."
Jasmine B.,"Detroit, United States",60,48,134,3.0,25/8/2017,This has been my second time coming to the Cheesecake Factory. Both times have been an amazing experience. Starting with the wait staff. They are very attentive to your needs. Today I order the side house salad with cheese on top and   with mash potatoes. I order it med. It came back med well. Other wise other problems. I will come back again as long as the cook watch the temp of the meat.
Darae K.,"Royal Oak, United States",0,8,,3.0,18/3/2017,"It was a while ago when I went so I'm extra late posting this review but anyway, I order the Cajun Chicken Pasta and my honey ordered the   and Shrimp Scampi. For our drinks, I ordered a virgin strawberry daiquiri I cant remember what he order but my daiquiri was a little bland and not blended properly so I sent it back in place of what my SIL got which was a peach smoothie that was ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!! It has either strawberry or raspberry puree at the bottom which give it a great flavor I think I ordered another one after I drank that one thats seriously how good it was.  My food was really gross I had a couple of bites and couldnt eat anymore because the pasta was dry and stuck together and all of the seasoning was just sprinkled on top and not equally spread out through the dish. I never sent it back because it already took long enough to come out in the first place so I didnt want to wait past the time necessary to order something else. His food was AMAZING the steak pieces were VERY TENDER and that sauce they use I think its some kind of wine reduction that tastes AMAZING! After tasting his food I quickly wished I would've ordered that myself.  We've had the cheesecake as well and that's really the best reason to go which is what they're known for (hence the name). The smoothie, cheesecake, and   is the best reasons to go for me but to each their own.  Another complaint I have is the horribly long wait time I was about 7 or 8 months pregnant at the time and starving so I was already cranky but even if I wasn't pregnant the wait would've been entirely too long. It was a Saturday night when we went and we waited for 2 1/2-3 hours to get into the restaurant and be seated it was so annoying and the mall was closed so we were sitting on a bench outside the inside mall doors outside of California Kitchen. They only have like 2 benches available outside of the restaurant for you to wait and some seating on the wall."
Rebecca W.,"Southfield, United States",34,125,169,2.0,26/10/2014,"I was not impressed the entrées took a long time to arrive at our table. They lay the silverware on the table as place setting. Not good! The Shrimp and   was a big let down. 3 shrimp and a couple of chunks of steak mixed with mushrooms, the rest of the plate was mashed potatoes  The Bang Bang Chicken: sauce was delicious though not enough the weird thing about it were pools of grease in it. Rice rational far exceeds the rest of the meal.  I've had tastier meals."
Amber W.,"Detroit, United States",0,13,20,4.0,17/1/2016,"I spent my 4th time at this restaurant just yesterday for my Mom's birthday. I've had the chicken madera, the chicken Marsala, avocado eggrolls, crab wontons, Mexican chicken lettuce wraps, The  , and more food that I can even remember. Needless to say it's worth the wait. Of course the earlier you go, the shorter the wait. The wait staff is always great and the atmosphere is beautiful! I love this restaurant and I will continue to frequent here! The cheesecake is AMAZING and each visit I tried a different type. They all were excellent!!!!"
Jenny K.,"Detroit, United States",310,194,2136,4.0,4/4/2016,"One word to describe The Cheesecake Factory: consistent. I used to eat here all the time when I lived in Chicago and was glad they opened one here. Whenever friends or family would visit, this is where they wanted to go. It's always busy here and our wait is 30 minutes or longer each time. They have an extensive menu of regular and ""skinnylicious"" items. They also have almost two pages worth of cheesecake flavors you can try, hence their namesake and main attraction. In our most recent visit, I ordered a combination plate of the   and Chicken Madeira with mashed potatoes. It was a lot of food and tasted great. I ordered the steak medium and had 3 pieces of steak on my plate. There were 2 cooked medium and 1 cooked medium-rare. Our waiter, Michael, took the one piece and had it cooked a bit longer so I could eat while my meal was hot. He was awesome! Attentive, friendly, and offered some great recommendations for both our meals and cheesecake. I ordered the Fresh Banana Cream Cheesecake, which is topped with Bavarian cream and fresh sliced bananas. It wasn't as heavy as other cheesecakes I've had here, such as the chocolate-flavored ones. Those are very rich; delicious, but sweet. Overall, we had a great dining experience. I'm sure we'll be here again soon, especially if we notice it isn't extremely busy when we're in the area. However, I doubt it!"
Charity F.,"Southfield, United States",44,75,102,4.0,4/5/2015,"The cheesecake factory is nothing really to get overly excited about. Its your standard American fare  favorites that range from pasta, burritos to orange chicken. The portions are large so bring an empty stomach. But not too empty because the waits are still pretty long. For our party of 6 we waited and hour to be seated. Once seated I would say it took 30 minutes for our food once the order was placed. And another 30 minutes for our cheesecakes that we ordered to go. Our waiter was great; made sure we had refills and plenty of bread as we waited. Now to the good stuff our food. I ordered the chicken Bellagio which I wanted to sub the cream sauce it comes with for Alfredo sauce. I had this dish before and didn't care for the sauce it came with. It wasn't thick enough for my liking. I get my plate eat some of it and realize it wasn't Alfredo sauce. Huge disappointment but since I didnt want to wait another long time for the correction I just sucked it up and decide just set it aside and safe room for cheesecake. My mother ordered  the burrito which was surprisingly good. I would def give that a try next time. My sister had there   and chicken Madeira which are favorites of mine. Absolutely love the sauces on them. My uncle had their Shepard's pie which he enjoyed. The cheesecakes were delicious as usual. The food is really good here despite me receiving the wrong sauce. Its nothing to die for or to wait over an hour for but it is better than your average chain."
Janelle G.,"Grand Rapids, United States",3,18,,3.0,15/5/2014,"It makes me sad to give a restaurant 3 stars, but in this case I think the rating is generous.  I have been to this restaurant 3 times. The first time everything was good. We knew we would have to wait, and that was fine. Once we were seated all was well except the cocktails were slow coming out. I got wasabi tuna, and my boyfriend got the Jamaican shrimp--he made the better choice. I can't remember which cheesecakes we got but they were good too.  The second time we went, a Tuesday night, the restaurant was still full but our wait was only about 20 minutes. We ordered an appetizer, which seemed to be taking awhile to come out. Then all of a sudden our meals were brought out! We decided to cancel the appetizer. I can't remember what my boyfriend ordered, but I got the combo chicken madeira and  . I took a bite of my chicken and the sauce was really good, but the texture was not right. I looked, and the chicken was raw. I showed my boyfriend to get confirmation and he said yep--that's raw. I showed my server when she returned and she apologized. The manager came over and offered a complimentary salad while we waited. He also gave us 2 free slices of cheesecake. I wasn't angry--I understood and thought it was handled well. I was lucky to not get sick.  I brought my mom on the Saturday before mother's day. I had enjoyed the  , so I ordered the combo with that and the salmon. I asked for medium rare-medium steak. I could not find a speck of pink in the meat. It was very well done. We had already waited a couple hours and I did not want to wait for my meal (again). So I just ate the salmon (which was great) and choked down the dry meat.  The kitchen is having some serious organizational issues. Perhaps investing in a reliable meat thermometer would be useful?  I like the cheesecake, but I'm inclined to just get a piece to go after dining somewhere else in the area."
Liz W.,"Belleville, United States",1533,1111,145,4.0,8/12/2013,"I know it is overhyped. I know it is overpriced. I also know you are foolish to wait for it. I still have a soft spot for The Cheesecake Factory.  I went awhile back in the sweet spot of dining out time wise. It was like a Tuesday or Wednesday afternoon around 3pm. There was little to no wait. Wait staff did a good job. Sat in a half booth and was comfy too.  The food was really quite delish. My dad had the   and shrimp scampi combo, my mom had the Jamaican black pepper shrimp and I went with the herb crusted salmon. All were happy and huge, none were dietician friendly. I think very few things on the menu are to be frank. This doesn't bother me a bit, if you are trying to eat anywhere near healthy it may bother you. Me, well I figure they state they are a cheesecake place so I am not expecting health food. I love the sinful nature of the salmon here, the lemon sauce is creamy and evil, a pure butter base. This rich sauce is perfect with the slightly crisped salmon, calorie bomb mashed potatoes and tender crisp asparagus. I also loved my mom's shrimp because of the black beans, mango salsa and fried plantains. They all worked together well with the kick of the shrimp. My dad's scampi was tasty but I am not hugely into  . It is a good rendition if you like it though. I will get a salad next time because the portions were so generous I couldn't order a dessert. I took a bite of my mom's carrot cake and meh. Skip it. I'm betting the carrot cheesecake is better. I find the cakes in here to be a bit overrated myself but the cheesecakes are always fabu. My bite of my father's key lime cheesecake was bliss. I like it here a lot but will not be a regular until the hype dies a bit."
