Billy J.,"Detroit, MI",276,205,96,4.0,12/11/2015,"Who in their right mind wouldn't like Cheesecake. The best time to go here, is anytime before 5pm. They have lunch specials that are up to $5 off the dinner price.  Of course with the name like Cheesecake Factory, the cheesecake is on point. You can order any different kind and you will surely be impressed. The service here is pretty average for a restaurant that is as busy as this place is. Be careful of the time you go, the typical busy weekend/nights are busy. Your wait may be longer then you want it to be, however it is for sure worth it.  I suggest eating the cheese cake no mater what, even if your lactose. It's that good!"
Brittany A.,"New Baltimore, MI",5,14,34,3.0,9/18/2016,There is a long wait. But go at the right time its only like 15minutes. I been a couple times its a 45min drive for me but i love coming. Drinks are awesome. But i can deal without the flys and fruit flys as a unwelcome guess.   if i have to keep looking up to watch my kids food u lose 2 stars automatically.
Christina G.,"Beverly Hills, MI",83,249,1096,4.0,2/12/2015,Very good meal!   Cozy winter dinner with my girlfriend. The music is a little loud and there is usually a wait (my only complaints).  Avocado egg rolls are yummy. My next meal will be miso salmon. I've heard it's great. Entrees are $12-25 and more homemade tasting than your typical chain restaurant.
Christine B.,"Belleville, MI",128,318,93,3.0,12/18/2015,"I went with a group of 8. We arrived around 5:00 on an evening that was busy with holiday gatherings and shoppers. We only had to wait about 20 minutes to be seated. Timing seems to be everything with this place. Though, since it's in the mall, waiting a couple of hours, as happens on weekends and later in the evening, may not bother everyone.  The service was great. Our waitress was knowledgeable and attentive. She knew the menu and the drinks well and made good suggestions.  The food was okay. Based on recommendations here, we tried the nachos. While it was a huge portion and easily shared among 8, the flavor was so so. As was the calamari and the avocado egg rolls. I ordered the grilled fish tacos, recommended by a friend, and they were also just okay. The rice served with them was bland and was not hot on my plate. The black beans were very good. The tacos themselves were well presented, but their flavor was boring. What should have been a contrast of textures, chewy shells, crunchy cabbage, tender fish, just didn't have enough contrast. It seemed as if nothing was held at the right temperature or that the tacos had been made up and sat for a long time before serving.  At my table I overheard several similar comments on the food, well-flavored salmon, but overcooked, another cold side dish. Perhaps this was an off night, or maybe the sheer number of menu items makes it hard to do anything too well?  Since I was off to another event following dinner, I didn't have any dessert, but if I go back I think that's what I'll stick to since it's in the name."
Holly M.,"Wyandotte, MI",0,14,1,1.0,11/18/2017,"We frequent cheesecake factory 2 to 3 times a year but always go around my husband's birthday every year also. This year we took our 9 month old son and we were thrilled when the wait was only 15 minutes. We requested a table for 2 and a highchair. When our pager went off the hostess was pretty rude to me for no reason but I figured they are usually busy, maybe just a bad day. We waited behind the hostess stand for our table for another few minutes. When the host came up to seat us he said ""you have three people not two."" We said yes we requested a high chair... the hostess even repeated it back to us. He walked away and left us standing in between the hostess stand and the tables. And never came back. We waited another 10 or 15 minutes before walking back up to the stand and the hostess acted like she had never seen us before. We explained what happened and she asked where our pager was..... and then what pager number we had. My husband actually remembered the number so she then had to ""look us up,"" like we were lying. Then she asked if we wanted to sit at the bar. I was super frustrated and said I don't want to sit at the bar with my 9 month old child. She told me to chill out. That was it. We left and won't be back. I'm not going to spend over 100 dollars on dinner to be treated like that. This girl should not be working with the public. I emailed corporate and haven't heard anything back yet. Ugh, so disappointing."
Meng H.,"Warren, MI",0,19,43,4.0,10/5/2016,"Not bad. I have always wanted to go here since it opened 3 years ago. Oddly, I just kept forgetting. My wife and I went here for dinner on a Thursday night. Good music and beautiful inside. My wife ordered the old burger and fries. I ordered the Cajun pasta. Mine was very good. My wife's burger was ok. ""Well done"" means burned at this location. The price was around the price of red lobster and Olive Garden. All in all, it wasn't bad. Lots of menu items to try. Next time..."
Tina T.,"Washington, DC",0,1,11,4.0,10/26/2016,"First time eating at The Cheesecake Factory. Went on a Saturday at noon, we were seated right away. Our waiter was great! Food was great! Will return"
Christina C.,"Ann Arbor, MI",201,7,,2.0,3/18/2017,The food was good - not great. Also the service is terrible. We got seated and had to wait 10 mins until we complained to get a server. Paul the manager came by and apologized but the service never got better! It was just a horrible dinning experience which is just sad.
Adam C.,"Lake Orion, MI",27,7,,1.0,1/22/2017,Food was only alright for the price. Had to wait almost 30 minutes for cheesecake because it was backed up. Will never go back. I don't even normally leave reviews but you get bored when waiting that long for desert.
Warda B.,"Dearborn, MI",28,1,1,1.0,10/14/2016,"Definitely not worth the long wait, or money. Spend your hours at a restaurant where the workers aren't condescending and the silverware isn't dirty. Super disappointed, and I was actually looking forward to eating here for the first time. 1:30 wait to have some tasteless food, and thawed cheesecake. So unfortunate."
Darae K.,"Royal Oak, MI",0,8,,3.0,3/18/2017,"It was a while ago when I went so I'm extra late posting this review but anyway, I order the Cajun Chicken Pasta and my honey ordered the Steak Diane and Shrimp Scampi. For our drinks, I ordered a virgin strawberry daiquiri I cant remember what he order but my daiquiri was a little bland and not blended properly so I sent it back in place of what my SIL got which was a peach smoothie that was ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!! It has either strawberry or raspberry puree at the bottom which give it a great flavor I think I ordered another one after I drank that one thats seriously how good it was.  My food was really gross I had a couple of bites and couldnt eat anymore because the pasta was dry and stuck together and all of the seasoning was just sprinkled on top and not equally spread out through the dish. I never sent it back because it already took long enough to come out in the first place so I didnt want to wait past the time necessary to order something else. His food was AMAZING the steak pieces were VERY TENDER and that sauce they use I think its some kind of wine reduction that tastes AMAZING! After tasting his food I quickly wished I would've ordered that myself.  We've had the cheesecake as well and that's really the best reason to go which is what they're known for (hence the name). The smoothie, cheesecake, and Steak Diane is the best reasons to go for me but to each their own.  Another complaint I have is the horribly long wait time I was about 7 or 8 months pregnant at the time and starving so I was already cranky but even if I wasn't pregnant the wait would've been entirely too long. It was a Saturday night when we went and we waited for 2 1/2-3 hours to get into the restaurant and be seated it was so annoying and the mall was closed so we were sitting on a bench outside the inside mall doors outside of California Kitchen. They only have like 2 benches available outside of the restaurant for you to wait and some seating on the wall."
Matthew P.,"Farmington Hills, MI",1,20,27,1.0,12/23/2016,"Absolutely terrible! DO NOT waste your time or hard earned money here!!! Bad service. Bad food. Pasta tasted like it came out of a 99 cent Chef Boyardee can. The service, however was the worst. Rude, inconsiderate, and inattentive. I do not know how this place stays in business. Well I'm sure it won't be around for long unless major changes are made."
Brian P.,"Harrison charter Township, MI",0,8,,2.0,11/28/2016,"I really used to love this place.  It's an hour from home, there's always a 2 hour wait, no reservations, no call ahead seating.. but, it's usually good food and a good selection, especially their small bites and apps.  This time I ended up having to argue with my waitress which was very awkward and I won't return. I'll just get down to it: Told 40 minute wait.. was over an hour.  Ok, whatever.  We get seated around 7 on a Sunday (didn't get out until after 9).  Of course we're put in those row booths with chairs on the other side so you're about 6 inches from the people next to you.  There are 3 of us including a toddler which makes you want a little privacy so the kid's not bugging people.  They don't care about that there. 10 minute wait for drink and I was very thirsty after waiting for over an hour to be seated.  It's not a terribly long wait.  30 minute wait for bread.   Ordered the crab cake bites.  Really good and a good price.  Didn't wait long for those. Next.  Ordered the fish tacos for dinner.  Wife had the shrimp and salmon combination.  Kid had the bowtie pasta with butter and parmesan. My wife's dish came out 5 minutes before the rest.  Whatever. Kids pasta was ok.  A LOT of butter for a kid's dish.  We didn't get the included drink.  Probably would have ordered a milk.  A lot of places also offer a veggie or something.  Not here.  $7 for something I could make for 50 cents.  3 ingredients.  Pretty easy.  Wife's fish was nice and moist.  Shrimp tasty.   Mashed potatoes were really good.  But there were only 3 small shrimp and about a 4 ounce piece of fish.  I recall large portions at Cheesecake Factory and always bringing food home... no longer.  And, for $22 I expected at least 4 shrimp?   Finally, fish tacos, bleh.  Fish was ok.  The salsa stuff didn't have much flavor.  They forgot the avocado... I told my waitress when she brought our desert after checking the menu to confirm.  She just acknowledged it and I asked her to tell them they forgot it.  Fish tacos without avocado... maybe it's small, but I would have ordered one of the other 500 things on the menu if i knew there would be no avocado.  Anyway, she gave us the bill.  Kind of snuck it under my arm.  I found her and told her that I wasn't happy and asked if she told a manager.  I said all this waiting and a relatively expensive dinner I expect my dish to be correct.  She told me if I had told her during dinner she would have fixed it.. well, she had disappeared for 10 minutes after the food came so I had already eaten half the meal.  Then she asked what I wanted her to do... that the manager would ask the same thing.  Really?  You screw something up and expect the customer to have to ask for something?  I at least expected a manager to come and apologize.  Offer a free drink, desert, something.  I told her to let the manager decide and she gave us the kid's meal for free.  Still, no manager came and said a word.  She didn't apologize and just handed us the check.  10% tip instead of 20% right there.  Be nice and fix the problem and it would have been 25%. You get the idea that since there's such a long wait they don't have to actually try any more.  Like they could lose half their customers and still be busy so why work on customer service.  Even without the issue with the waitress and the avocado you just add up all the little things and wonder why you just waited so long to eat there.  And WHY would you pay $8 for a slice of cheesecake.. it's not THAT good.  Well, I have no reason to go back to twelve oaks or the cheesecake factory.  If I screw up and forget this experience and you see me there, please punch me.  I deserve it."
Brittany R.,"Detroit, MI",55,228,102,2.0,6/5/2016,"decent, but not great. the two stars are solely for the cheesecake only. we visited on a late Saturday night, and our party of 4 was able to walk right in and get seated. the service was pretty good, but other than that i see no reason people are willing to wait 3+ hours to eat here. our table ordered the spinach dip, cajun jambalaya pasta, gumbo, and a burger. the spinach dip was literally just ok, nothing special and definitely not worth the $12 we paid for it. the problem i had was with my Cajun jambalaya pasta, seriously people? why are so many people obsessed with this dish? do people just not know how to cook at home and are easily impressed? that has to be it, because when i say there was 0 flavor in this dish, i am not exaggerating. the only thing about it was the presentation was great, but other then that, nothing stood out. you get lots of peppers and chicken/shrimp in this dish, but no flavor whatsoever. it literally tasted like someone just dumped an entire can of pepper on noodles, just awful. usually i am not hard to please with food, but if this is one of their more popular dishes, i don't understand why. my fiancé said his gumbo was pretty good, and my sister said her burger was decent. however both me and my cousin who ordered the same as me did NOT like the pasta at all. we all ordered cheesecake slices to go and those were delicious as always, but i definitely will order something different when i come back! and i'm only going to return because i have a gift card, other than that, this place is not worth the long ass wait time!"
Jewels M.,"Grandville, MI",1,7,1,3.0,12/10/2016,"You wait.. and wait... and wait and when you wait till the time they tell you, you wait some more then you finally sit down to a sweet waitress and eat some great food and then you wait..,and wait again for your cheesecake. The waiting sucks!"
Christina W.,"Clinton Township, MI",44,30,21,5.0,5/17/2016,Tyler V took care of myself and my friend. We had long day after meeting all day. He made us laugh and took good care of us with our Tuna was amazing! Cheesecake I had tiramisu my friend had salted caramel she even ordered an extra piece to go for later date hahaha Tyler V we love you will be back! Tyler V is awesome! He will make you laugh and make sure your food in great!
Bruce F.,"Westland, MI",701,314,399,5.0,8/29/2015,"For right now, I just wanted to note that their Factory Nachos Appetizer with Chicken is off the charts! And then, that the Classic Original Cheesecake is the creamiest, cheesiest melt in your mouth deliciousness I/We've ever had. Wow! We came back twice and ordered the Factory Nachos and the Original Cheesecake Desert with Coffee and we may just do it again before we get to try anything else on the menu. It's the best! 5 stars and I'll definitely be back..."
Alysia H.,"Redford Charter Township, MI",39,8,,1.0,6/5/2016,"We came here for my daughter's birthday and I am appalled at how our meal went. It started with the appetizer taking 20+mins bc they burned it the first time (no big deal, manager apologized) however.... When the birthday girl's spaghetti came it was dry and old-looking, completely unacceptable to serve (i am in the industry, it was 100% not ok). Second daughter's food was ok (can't really mess pizza up) then my steak/shrimp combo came.... Each piece was a different temperature, I ordered mid rare and received one less than rare, on med well, and one medium. Wtf?! No manager apologized, server half heartedly apologized, aka we won't be back."
Asim S.,"Novi, MI",0,1,,1.0,2/17/2017,Waiting 20 mins after our beeper was handed to the front staff. They claimed they got mixed up the beepers!! Seriously disappointing. Very bad service
Meghan P.,"Howell, MI",41,13,1,5.0,11/8/2015,"Well after reconsidering never dining at this establishment again, my boyfriend had a hankering for some chicken and waffles. So with much grunting but with the promise of as many martnins as I could handle I couldn't say no.   All I can say about this visit is WOW! Our server Tyler was such a delight. He was nothing less than spectacular! The food came out hot and perfectly cooked. My drink was never empty. I left satisfied and feeling like one can never judge a whole establishment based on one bad dinning experience. So thank you Tyler for being a wonderful ambassador for the cheesecake factory !! Five stars!!!"
