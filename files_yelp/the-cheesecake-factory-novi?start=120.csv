Hannah M.,"Livonia, MI",150,51,52,1.0,4/7/2016,"It's official, I'm insane... I keep trying this place over & over again expecting different results... HORRIBLE experience today. 1. Didn't even know who our server was?!? 2. Waited 10 minutes to get knifes for our meals after receiving our entrees 3. Both tables next to us, we're having basically the same issues... 4. My flatbread had hard breadcrumbs sprinkled on top? And my friends steak came with .1oz of potatoes... Huh?? I really hope the family that owns this chain, gets a reality check soon. No one seems happy recently and it makes me sad. Lemon Raspberry Cream Cheesecake: To-go, YES! Dine in, NO!!!!"
Kris S.,"Taylor, MI",116,8,4,3.0,3/3/2017,After being contacted by Customer Service I am happy they took care of my problem an acknowledge what happend s hopefully it won't happen again looking forward to trying   out again
Albert E.,"Ann Arbor, MI",17,46,14,1.0,4/29/2016,"Horrible food, service is hit or miss, but at least ambience is nice.  Chicken Chorizo omelette:  potatoes were burned and very dark. Egg omelette tasted rubbery, very artificial taste and texture. Chicken chorizo filling was ok.  Miso salmon:  rice was dry and undercooked. Not moist at all.  Salmon was nothing special.  Sweet miso sauce very sweet that you can't taste miso.  Bacon chicken pasta (Evelyn's pasta?):  extremely greasy!!  I love bacon but that was so greasy I couldn't even taste the pasta sauce, therefore, very bland! Cheesecakes and desserts very good as usual, thankfully because they are not made in house. I usually take the family here once a month for Sunday brunch because of the ambience and we usually order breakfast items because it is harder to screw up breakfast, but today's lunch was sh*t!!!   Most waitstaff are well trained, but some from the other side of the tracks need to take their attitude elsewhere. I already overpay for less than average quality food and shouldn't have to deal with servers who do not have basic customer service skills such as a smile.  I'll be getting take out desserts from now on."
Scarlett O.,"Temperance, MI",0,35,,4.0,8/6/2017,"Took kiddo after a back to school marathon shopping session.  As usual, the wait was awhile-45 minutes but completely worth it.  (And realistically, 45 minutes at 7ish on a Saturday night is pretty common at many places...)  Our waiter was great! Despite the fact that they were slammed; he never rushed us, kept up on drink refills, food was hot & didn't wait long between courses or for the check.  For food we ordered the cashew chicken, Louisiana chicken pasta (to go for hubby) & chicken costelletto.  All were huge portions and delicious.  We also got the lemon meringue, reese's peanut butter cup & lemon/raspberry cheesecakes--all to go since we were too stuffed after dinner to enjoy them.   Some people don't like how huge the menu is or how long the wait is, but for me I have no issues with either.  A large menu means there is something for everyone & a long wait means the food is good if others are willing to wait that long! Personally, I live about an hour away (wish there was one closer, but such is life) and there aren't too many places I'd be willing to drive that far just for food that isn't a special occasion type place; cf is one of those few places!!"
Amanda K.,"Livonia, MI",0,5,,5.0,8/6/2017,"Wait here is typically long, but you know that going in. Wait staff is pleasant and knowledgeable, service is good, and there is a huge menu of food and cheesecake to choose from.  Portions from the regular menu are very large, but smaller portions are on the ""skinnylicious"" menu and those options are just as delicious!  I don't come here often, but always leave satisfied."
Rob T.,"Troy, MI",0,10,1,1.0,4/9/2016,"WORST EXPERIENCE EVER.  1. A 3 hour wait on Saturday evening - I was expecting a long wait from the other reviews so this was the least of my ordeal. 2. My table was dirty, there were still crumbs on the table and in utensils on the floor when we were finally seated. 3. My order came out wrong, this too I can forgive because my waiter was new. I sent the order back then ended up canceling my meal because it took another 20 minutes to fix and by then I ate bites of my friends' food and was so pissed off by the end of their meal. 4. My poor waiter had the manager come talk to us and he turned out to be a jackass. Instead of apologizing and being nice, he came out first arguing about our wait time down to the minutes, then arguing that there was an error in how I ordered the meal, then last he tried to rectify the situation by giving us a slice of cheesecake. AN APOLOGY AND BEING NICE GOES A LONG WAY, what an arrogant asshole.  There was a second manager who didn't even come out after we told our waiter that her manager was rude.  I WILL NEVER GO HERE AGAIN, take my advice stay home or eat ANYWHERE BUT HERE! Support your local restaurants."
Sara T.,"West Bloomfield Township, MI",3,37,4,5.0,3/12/2017,Love this place. The food is always outstanding. Service is good. Only downside is they have a no reservation policy.
Kirstie W.,"East Lansing, MI",22,3,,1.0,11/23/2016,"All I needed was to pick up a 10inch low carb frozen Cheesecake. Last year we picked up the same low carb 10inch cheesecake and I was in and out within 10 minutes. Today it took me 45. There was one person in the to go line ahead of me and after he placed his order both people at the register left and I was standing alone for 10 mins. Finally a girl came and took my order and I watched as she placed the paper near the cheesecake area and waited. 10..20..25 mins pass by and people are lining up getting antsy. I noticed there were people behind me who already got their cakes which didn't make sense as I watched them place their order after me. I went to the hostess area and told the lady my situation and she said in a rude tone ""they're backed up or maybe they called your name and you just didn't hear it. It takes a while because they have to take the Cheesecake out put dressing on it and set it up nicely in the box. the people that ordered after you probably ordered something small. Ask them how much longer"" well... 1. I stood there the entire time they did not call my name. I would've heard it. 2. I ordered a plain low fat cheesecake... there's nothing to do to it except put it in a box. It's just a plain frozen cheesecake no whip cream nothing. 3. She could've just said I'm sorry for the wait. We've been really backed up. I would say I'm pretty patient but her tone was just rude.  I normally don't post reviews or say anything but I felt that the staff was not attentive nor really cared bc it's not their problem.  The guy at the pick up area was nice about it though and he agreed that the low carb cheesecake shouldn't take that long- and he apologized for the wait which made up for it. He looked to check if t came out.. which if didn't and he had someone call the back to bring it out. They did that within 5 mins. I didn't catch his name but he should be handling customer service as his responses are a lot better than the ladies there."
Alex S.,"Wayne, MI",0,15,1,5.0,7/14/2017,"Attention management and all future Cheesecake Factory goers, do yourself a favor and ask for Katie Cape. She was outstanding. She was down to earth, personable, and just so awesome. It had been a while since I had been to the CCF and this was my first time at this location and it was just a great time. My wife and I decided last minute to grab a late dinner and some cheesecake, the wait was short, we got to eat outside and enjoy the great weather, and we had A+ service. Portions were great too. When I do get the chance to go back I hope Katie is working. So remember, if you want the best Cheesecake Factory experience, ask for Katie."
Jeff B.,"White Lake Township, MI",1,29,78,2.0,8/8/2015,"We visited The Cheesecake Factory for lunch on 08-06-2015.  This was the second time we dined at this location.   We were seated promptly as we arrived around 04:00 PM and the place was not busy.  And yet, it took a good 25-30 minutes to get our meals.  The taste of the food was very good.  I actually would rate the food a 4 or 5 star. It didn't appear that this establishment had any management on duty. Two male waiters spent15-20 minutes socializing with two young woman at the table in from of us.  If supervision were present I can't imagine they would allow this on the dining floor.  At least I would hope not. Finding broken toothpicks in your food is un-acceptable.  They lose two stars for this safety hazard alone. My wife ordered a chicken salad sandwich.  I understand they hold each half of the sandwich together with a tooth pick.  However, one should never find a third broken half of a tooth pick INSIDE the sandwich.  Clearly, who ever made the sandwich misplaced the tooth pick and simply added an additional one. Again, I have no complaints about the food.  It does appear however, that the Cheesecake Factory is missing some checks and balances in the managing of this restaurant."
Josh B.,"Grand Rapids, MI",0,7,,2.0,8/1/2017,I ate at the cheesecake factory about a week ago. The meal was absolutely horrible. My recommendation would be to get  higher quality food. Nice atmosphere and service. But the food was horrible.
Dae Y.,"Novi, MI",0,1,,1.0,11/26/2016,Terrible service and long wait time.  Food isn't that great either. Ruined my dinner with my family. Do not recommend to anyone
Shari A.,"Royal Oak, MI",0,8,3,1.0,11/15/2016,"Made a bad first impression. Very slow and poor service today. Brought the before meal bread AFTER my food came. To me, this place is overpriced and over rated. Would probably NOT return to this place."
Magnus L.,"Denton, TX",95,603,258,4.0,7/7/2014,"We were finally able to go here without having to spend half the day in line. It was in the middle of the week around 6 pm and the wait was a little less than an hour which is decent considering how busy they still are.  The service at every Cheesecake Factory restaurant I've been to is better than average and it was very good when we went. I had the Cajun pasta and it was quite good, I had no leftovers so that's a good sign.  I had to get some cheesecake while we were here and I went with their strawberry cheesecake. It's one of my favorite cheesecake flavors now hands down."
Brian B.,"Los Angeles, CA",24,274,,1.0,12/28/2016,"I have been to many Cheesecake Factories and love them, but this location is by far the worst and is poorly managed. We ordered carry-out as the wait times are 1-3 hours. Requested bread and they ran out and had us wait a half hour until we gave up and left. Asked for extra sauce on the shrimp scampi dish and that did not happen. The pasta dishes were cold and poorly cooked, closer to raw. I briefly spoke with the manager for assistance and she was unable to help as she was dealing with complaints from other customers and there was a line. Skip this location, total disaster."
Lori A.,"Royal Oak, MI",0,6,1,3.0,1/8/2017,"The only reason I went here for the second time is because i had another gift card to use.came on a Friday afternoon at 5:00. 50 minute wait for 2 people. Even sat in same area as previous visit. Very noisy, slow bar service. Seems like there are several employees but slow service. Absolutely not worth wait. Over priced but good food."
Michelle T.,"Troy, MI",5,6,2,4.0,5/28/2017,"I would give 5 stars except this location is too small (I think I heard smallest in the country?) and being the only Metro Detroit location they should have known that the size would be a huge issue.  With that being said, the staff accommodated our 12 person family party for our 80 year old family member.  The manager eventually helped out the hostess who was doing his best with the crowds to figure out where to seat our party in what I believe was a reasonable amount of time.  The staff was super nice and made our party feel welcome and special!!!  Of course, the food was great.  It's pricey, but everyone knows that right?  I think corporate needs to help out by opening either an additional location, or finding a larger space as this location really is small and cannot handle this city!!!  I have been to the locations in Cleveland and Chicago and they are at least 3-4 times the size!!!  Great job goes to the staff for doing the best they can with the size limitations."
M D.,"Novi, MI",0,8,,4.0,7/24/2017,"PHILIP G is by far your best server.  He should be a trainer as he is very efficient, personable, quick with service and our order is ALWAYS accurate with him.  He cares a lot about the job he does and it makes us want to come back for more...should we get him as our server.  We frequent CF and often times our servers are very slow to greet us, hard to get drink refills, our food items come out separately, we have to ask for condiments that should automatically come with our meal...sometimes twice, etc."
Jennifer Y.,"Troy, MI",89,9,43,4.0,9/29/2015,"I visited on 9/26/15. 1st time here! All my friends talked about how amazing the cheesecake tasted, so I had to try it myself. The place was packed so carryout was the way to go! I originally wanted to get Cherry Cheesecake but they ran out.  So I got the Kahlua Cocoa Coffee Cream Cheesecake and also tried Chris' Outrageous Cheesecake. Both were so rich and good. One day, I plan to try every flavor cheesecake they have! The Cheesecake Factory should open a store in Somerset Mall and I'd go there every single day!"
R P.,"Waterford Township, MI",0,2,,4.0,5/12/2017,"I am so glad they opened a Cheesecake Factory in Novi, MI because now we have one close to home!"
