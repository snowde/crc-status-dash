Judith Y.,"Southfield, MI",0,34,18,1.0,3/29/2016,"Food is adequate. However, if you want clean dishes and cutlery you may have a problem! Omgoodness!! Had to ask for three different tea cups and then I had a surprise in my teapot...lettuce!!  When I asked for another bowl to share my dessert they gave my daughter a filthy one. I'm scared to think what our dishes looked like from the kitchen!  The waitress was unfazed by the lettuce in the teapot...can't go back there! They get one star because the food was served hot."
P F.,"Clarkston, MI",3,74,46,2.0,11/26/2016,"Their cheese cake is usually delicious but service is the worst, we were the only ones at the register for ordering a slice of cheese cake and the second in line to pick up a slice of cheese cake, the wait took 14 min for getting a slice of cheese cake. The slices are thinner than a year ago. The chocolate mousse cake was below expectations and not very tasty. The prices are premium so I would expect better service and cake too."
Jo R.,"Harrison Township, MI",30,18,28,4.0,8/30/2015,"My hubby & I visited Cheesecake Factory yesterday afternoon around 3:00 for his bday. We had a 30 min wait. Food was very good as it was the first visit I had. Our waitress had several tables she was tending to so checking on us was a bit slow. But she was very good and polite.  We had pretzel chicken, pulled pork sandwich & stuffed chicken tortillas. S'mores & raspberry truffle cheesecake.  The S'mores was very rich but raspberry was excellent."
Moe M.,"Long Beach, CA",2,12,11,2.0,10/16/2016,"Meh... not all that. Super long wait due to being in the mall which is a no brainer. The main issue I have is the food. It sucks. I have been to many cheesecake factories all over the country and this is by far the worst. Servers are ok and treat you fine but again when you wait that long for food, you expect it to actually taste good. 3 times I've tried it and all 3 times were a fail"
Emily B.,"Mount Pleasant, MI",74,32,69,5.0,7/9/2016,"Went here after months of dieting for a bodybuilding competition and let me say if you're going for a ""cheat meal"", over the top, ridiculously unhealthy meal it DOES NOT DISAPPOINT! Started off with some kind of fruity blended alcohol drink, then a got the Mac & cheese burger with sweet potato fries, and ended the night trying the carrot cake and the peanut butter butterfinger cheesecake. Everything was amazing. I have been wanting to go back ever since."
Ste H.,"Delray Beach, FL",1,16,15,2.0,10/9/2016,"Food today was a let down. My family and I love this restaurant, 4 out of 8 meals were cold and another was burned. Asked to speak to the manager and he wasn't helpful. Our waiter tried his best to work with what he was given. Love the chain but not this location."
Jim D.,"Venezia, Italy",0,3,1,1.0,7/5/2017,"Do NOT waste your time at this restaurant! WORST SERVICE EVER! I've been to multiple Cheesecake Factory Restaurants and I have never had such bad service as this location. Waited over 45 minutes to receive our dinners.  Asked to talk to the manager about our wait - never gave me a reason why it was taking so long or an apology! I was told they were ""putting the finishing touches on our meals!""  10 minutes later 2 of our entrees came out - WRONG! The other 3 entrees came out 5 minutes apart so we didn't even get to eat dinner together as a family. Did not even get a discount on our meals or an apology for the inconvenience! STAY AWAY FROM THE NOVI LOCATION!!  WORST PLACE EVER!"
Krystle C.,"Novi, MI",0,17,,1.0,3/5/2016,"Most atrocious carry out pickup ever. I expected a wait time, and for them to be busy considering it was a Saturday, so I called ahead to place my order. I was given a 20 minute wait time, which is actually very reasonable to me. When I arrived at the location to pick up my meal, the ladies at the register kept yelling for people to get in line to place an order (which I had already done) so I had to ask repeatedly where to stand for that, and kept being directed to an unreasonably one line of people waiting to place an order. Finally, I was informed that there's a separate area to wait for orders that were already placed and was able to check out.  The meal tasted decent, but was ice cold when I got it due to how long I had to wait just to cash out. (I work in the mall so I didn't have much wait time between pickup and eating it.) $17 for a small, cold, mediocre lunch portion of Alfredo, with no carry out supplies in my bag,  and terrible service is way too overpriced. I shouldn't have even tipped, and will never order carry out from there again."
Joe H.,"Woodbridge Township, NJ",0,34,1,1.0,5/26/2017,"I'm updating my review after another visit:  Will this location please hire chefs that know what they are doing??? It's clear the chefs here need to be completely retrained!!! This is the worst Cheesecake Factory I have ever had and after our last visit I won't be back. My fiancée and I both ordered pasta, I got my usual  Cajun jambalaya pasta, my fiancée got the 4 cheese pasta with linguini instead of penne and added shrimp. Both of our pasta's were VERY salty and lacked any kind of real flavor. Basically they were soaked in salt water. We have both ordered these dishes regularly and have never experienced anything like this before. The waitress did warn me and say another customer complained about the jambalaya pasta being too salty, but I said that's okay I order it all the time. Unfortunately I was wrong, and the pasta was in fact way too salty. It was obvious the chef had no idea how to add flavor to this dish and just loaded it with salt water. We went on a Wednesday night and it was pretty busy. It's clear this location does HORRIBLE when it's busy. The chefs get too overwhelmed and just rush everything. Please hire new chefs, and until you do we will not be back. So incredibly disappointing Cheesecake Factory. This location is the worst. Updated to 1 star, but I would give it zero stars if it were possible. I love Cheesecake Factory, but I hate this location and this poor excuse of a Cheesecake Factory restaurant. Unfortunately I don't expect this location to change, because all the bad reviews on here ever get is the basic, old, tired corporate response with nothing really done about it.   My fiancée and I love Cheesecake Factory, but after dining at this location I've realized the food is no where near what we are use to. I recently moved to Michigan from New Jersey, and Cheesecake Factory has been a restaurant my fiancée and I enjoy going to quite often especially for date night. Anytime we go our bill is $100 or more for the two of us.  Let me start by saying this review has nothing to do with the wait or the service and everything to do with the food. The wait was 25 minutes which wasn't bad for a Friday night. It's clear Cheesecake Factory is very popular here and I doubt this location or bad review will hurt the restaurant, but I'll share anyway in hopes of improvement. Anyways, we are use to about a 30-45 minute wait for Cheesecake Factory so 25 minutes wasn't  bad. Our waitress wasn't bad either. Drinks were good. The crab wonton appetizer was fine, dessert was the usual great Cheesecake that Cheesecake Factory provides. However, the entrees were the biggest disappointment for us. I ordered the Cajun Jambalaya pasta and my fiancée ordered the orange chicken. For the jambalaya pasta I kid you not ONLY TWO SHRIMP in the entire dish!!! I order this pasta all of the time and there is always a good 8-10 shrimp in the pasta. I thought maybe the shrimp was buried in the pasta somewhere, NOPE!!! The spice also was no where near what I'm use to and was very plain tasting. It tasted like it was missing something. The orange chicken looked like they cooked a bunch up and gave my fiancée the scraps. When she had this dish at other cheesecake factory's we always rave about how big the pieces of chicken are. What we got here were tiny pieces of chicken that it looked like no one else wanted. Like if you ordered catering and were left the small pieces at the bottom. Overall a major disappointment. We wanted to say something, but figured it wouldn't do much good. Unfortunately this Cheesecake Factory doesn't do the restaurant justice at all. If only all the customers who came here knew what they were really missing out on. I understand it was a Friday night and they were busy, but there is no excuse for only giving two shrimp and the last of the chicken. I'd like to think it was an off night and give the restaurant another shot, but I don't think I could allow myself to be ripped off out of shrimp like that again. Especially because I know how much better Cheesecake Factory is. If this is the only Cheesecake Factory you have had then all I can say is you are really missing out."
Marisa D.,"West Bloomfield Township, MI",27,175,34,4.0,7/25/2015,"This place always has a ridiculously long line. If you sit in the bar area either high top tables or bar its first come first serve. So while the tables had a two hour wait, we lucked out and sat right away at the bar. Started with spicy chicken nachos. It was large portion, as are most things here. Came with guacamole, salsa and sour cream. Great for sharing. We then got shrimp summer rolls. It came with two dipping sauces, one peanut and another soy sauce based. Very good and refreshing. We finished with a peanut butter cheesecake and a raspberry lemon cheesecake. Both very good. The raspberry had the most amazing raspberry sauce."
Adam A.,"Macomb, MI",151,2,,2.0,11/22/2016,"Poor hostess and take out service. The food is good, but they're extremely understaffed. Employees are so overwhelmed they are unconcerned about guest happiness."
Jadranka H.,"Birmingham, MI",611,166,1226,4.0,12/2/2013,"I'm addicted to this place, in this case it's a good thing! The feel of the place is hip, energetic, modern and alive!  This review is a combination of 3 visits, the staff is efficient, knowledgeable, friendly and goes above and beyond their job title. As for the food, there are literally pages of menu items that you would need a minimum of 10 minutes to get a full overview.   The dessert menu is a whole different story, that can take up to an hour to overview. Whatever you have ever dreamed of as your perfect cheesecake, they have it! I like the traditional cheesecake with fruits, but before you know it, your mind is in overload from the menu that you venture out to wanting everything.  I'm knocking down a star for the professionalism of a manager that I had to engage with when my chicken spring rolls were literally the same color, the multi purpose grease was not changed and it was still dripping with oil. This manager didn't have the full customer service skills needed in that restaurant. He didn't know how to fix the problem. I call it common sense. I didn't let that discourage me from coming back and my guests have taken a liking to it like I have. The majority of the menu items are enough for 2-3 people, keep that in mind.  Here's a priceless advice that I do, pull up and run in, get your name on the list, go park/valet, and go window shopping. I wish they took reservations, but that creates more madness! See you there very soon........"
Jaye L.,"Troy, MI",0,5,6,1.0,9/18/2016,"I'd give zero stars if I could.  I went with my friend to get cheesecake slices to go.  She ordered ONE slice and was told by the cashier it was going to be 20-25 minutes.  What? For one pre-sliced piece?!  Okay....well it turns out we would have been happy with the 25 minute wait because it ended up turning into an HOUR wait!  The people in front of us had been waiting an hour and twenty minutes.  Ridiculous!! They need a better system because the kitchen orders and the to-go orders are filled by the same staff and it seemed the kitchen orders were priority.  They also need to be honest about the wait time because we could have decided it wasn't worth the wait.  But they lie to you about the wait time and take your money first so you're stuck there.  With the manager present, when my friend called out the cashier on the wait time, she lied and said she told us an hour and wouldn't have told us 20-25 minutes.  I HEARD her tell my friend 20-25 minutes and to have her lie about it was enraging.  Own up to it and apologize.   If I were you, have the cashier write the wait time on your receipt and on a crowded night, ask the people waiting in line for to go orders how long they have been waiting.  Or better yet, don't go at all.   This place needs a more efficient system to deal with the to go orders.  Ridiculous and horrible service. Never again."
Gawai I.,"Detroit, MI",48,34,1,1.0,10/30/2016,"The menu is good but to even get a seat is like an hour wait every time we go there.  I won't mention the other reason why I wouldn't go there again because someone might take it the wrong way and think I'm psycho but they have a policy that I don't agree with and it's posted right on their front door.  As a law abiding citizen, I'm offended.  That's all I have to say."
Jeff W.,"Novi, MI",90,199,56,3.0,3/7/2015,"After reading through all the previous reviews, we don't have a ton to add to the conversation.  We thoroughly agree with a lot of the reviews, but we will share our experience nonetheless. We have dined here three times since they opened at 12 Oaks Mall.  We didn't go for the first time until last summer, because of the long waits.  As someone else stated, this place is good, but not wait 3 hours good.  I wouldn't really wait more than 30 minutes for this place. The food here is really good with large portions.  As someone else stated, everything is surprisingly good, but it is also really high in calories.  I am pretty sure I doubled my caloric intake just by eating one meal.  The nice thing is that my wife and I usually will split a meal because the portions are so big and you really have to leave room for the cheesecake. The cheesecake is really good, although really expensive for a piece of cheesecake.  I am pretty sure you can buy a pretty good whole cheesecake somewhere else.  We are not huge fans of cheesecake, but ""when in Rome""....maybe ""when in the Cheesecake Factory""?  Anyway, it is really rich and even when we split a piece, there is some left over.  Last time we got it with ice cream and the ice cream was amazing.  We might actually just get ice cream next time. The reason for only getting 3 stars is because of the overpriced items, the close quarters, and the mediocre service.  As stated by others, this place squeezes you in like coach class in a Spirit flight.  You definitely feel like you are sitting at a table with strangers, which may be customary in Europe, but not in America.  The waitstaff all three times have been just alright.  There are long wait times for bread, refills, and the waitstaff we have had has lacked any type of enthusiasm.  I have actually felt more welcomed at a Denny's. Overall, this is a good ""once and a while"" type place.  We usually come here for special occasions like birthdays or Mother's days.  If you do come, I suggest splitting a meal and probably a cheesecake as well.  In the end, if it is good enough for Sheldon Cooper it should be good enough for you!"
Franchesca M.,"Wixom, MI",135,3,1,3.0,10/1/2016,Every time I've been there is a pretty long wait. It's somewhat noisy inside and the tables are pretty close together. The food is decent but not the best. However the fried mac and cheese and the cheesecakes are worth the wait.
Chuck L.,"Walled Lake, MI",0,12,,3.0,2/22/2017,Very good food.  Very slow service.  The server seemed to have tables in other sections...took him 5 minutes to get silverware.  Coffee and cheesecake took 15 minutes to get to the table and the waiter told us it takes a long time to get cheesecake.  What?  This was on a Sunday night at 7 p.m. with the restaurant approximately 3/4 full.  I will probably not go back there again.
Isslam M.,"Plymouth, MI",22,18,1,5.0,1/25/2016,"I LOVE the food here. Their menu is extensive...there is a LOT to choose from. Ironically enough, I never have room left after dinner to actually order cheesecake. The veggie burger has to be the best veggie burger I have ever had. If you're coming here on the weekend, come at least an hour early, put your name down with the hostess, then go shop around. There is ALWAYS a long wait."
Hassen F.,"Canton, MI",173,23,3,1.0,10/4/2016,"This by far has to be the chain's worst run Cheesecake Factory location we've ever visited. Now going on two years open, and after a dozen tries, this Cheesecake Factory location still has problems getting food out in a timely manner, and worse, has management that is very condescending and disingenuous. As if giving the customer a courtesy credit on their bill for dropping the ball meant some kind of hit to their paychecks. I can't figure out why on two recent occasions, two distinct managers were not very responsive to our concerns and offered nothing more than a half-hearted apology as if our legitimate complaints were nothing. On second most recent visit, my son and his girlfriend arrived and sat down about 20 minutes before we arrived. Upon sitting down, I asked my son about bread. He said they told him they were out of bread and would be up. Another 20 minutes and still no bread. The server finally showed up to take our orders, I inquired. He said it was in the oven and coming soon. His tone and attitude was less than enthusiastic. I asked how much longer. His answer: I'll bring it out as soon as it was ready"". I mentioned that it had been 45 minutes since we arrived, -how difficult was it for a restaurant like CF to have bread readily available?   Again, he gave a very condescending response, so I asked that he find a manager and an alternate server with a better attitude.  He left the table, and we soon had another server with a much better attitude.  A manager later came by, we explained the situation, and our frustration. We got a half-hearted apology and lame explanation about the bread with little or no desire to make up for the delay in delivering bread to our table or for the attitude of the server.  Not even an offer for dessert on the house--not that it was a requirement, but it would have helped. Fast forward a month later, we went back for dessert at 9:45pm after waiting 45 minutes for a table. Two slices of Cheesecake was all we ordered, It wasn't until 10:30pm that we got our desserts. At 10:10, we asked the server, and she said yes, it takes 15 minutes on average to get dessert, and she went to check on them. She disappeared for more than 20 minutes when the desserts finally showed up at our table at 10:30, a full 45 minutes after our arrival. A manager finally came around the table who said that she had heard that we had a concern about a 15 minute time frame to receive desserts. She said this is normal. When I said it had taken 45 minutes, she said, ""Oh, I heard it was only 15 minutes. I suggested she check to see when our order had been entered into the system to resolve this discrepancy. She offered us a complimentary coffee or beverage (at 10:30pm) if we liked and we declined. We felt she too was disingenuous and insincere. We've been to Cheesecake Factories in Chicago, LA, Miami, Pasadena, Irvine, Schaumburg, etc., and never once have we had the kind of problems we've had at the Novi, MI location. It's sad, because this is where we live. It will be long time before we ever come back. These weren't our first times with issues with this location, but it seems management is more the problem than the help as they don't seem to want to be part of the solution. It doesn't take much to take ownership of things that go wrong. In Novi, don't expect that to happen."
Michele S.,"Chino Hills, CA",269,318,741,4.0,2/18/2014,"Came here for the happy hour from 4-6 pm. All the appetizers are 5 dollars and Mojito for 5 dollars. We ordered a couple Mojitos and they were fantastic. I could taste fresh mint and lime. The crab meats sand artichoke drips was excellent. It has a lot of crab meats and the sauce has lots of flavor. It is worth the price bc it only cost me five bucks each I also ordered my favorite dish Cajun shrimp Jambalaya past, but I was kinda disappointed about it. I have tried it at other Cheesecake Factory (in California) where they used flat pasta but here they use thin spaghetti.  We waited for 40 mins for the paste to come out. Initially I was not satisfied by the slow service but the manager came to us and apologize for the delay and offered to give us two free cheesecakes to take home!"
