Megan K.,"Farmington, MI",0,383,,2.0,2/11/2015,"My friend wanted to come and try it out. I'd never been to this location but I have been to Cheesecake Factories in Chicago and California. Their skinnylicious menu is good but the regular food....nope. You seriously have to fast for three days afterwards because their food is so calorie, fat, and sodium laden.  Anyway, we arrived on a Sunday at 8:30 pm. I had heard wait times were crazy in the past but it was Sunday night and this place has been open for at least a year now. I went up to the hostess and she told me it'd be an hour and a half wait. I had to have her repeat that because I was afraid my hearing had failed me. You have to be out of your mind to wait that long for food at the Cheesecake Factory. We promptly left and had a very nice meal elsewhere after being immediately seated."
Spencer G.,"Livonia, MI",44,1,,2.0,11/23/2016,Disappointing dinner. Took over 45 minutes for a cheeseburger and didn't even have the time for dessert. Food took so long i took a nap. Not worth the $15.
Ted K.,"Rochester, MI",0,1,4,1.0,10/29/2016,"I came with a party of six and had a very mixed experience.  The staff made a mistake with my order and had to fire a new order. I was okay with the mistake since the staff was so genuine about correcting the issue.  They offered soup and more bread but I declined.  I was happy with how quickly they resolved the issue.   This is where things go south.  My friend ordered the salmon.  He thought it didn't taste right and so he had his wife try it.  They both didn't think it was fresh so they asked the staff about it.  They seem concerned and got the manager.  The manager Brandon, kept telling our table that the fish comes in fresh every morning.  He didn't recognize my friends concern of becoming ill if he ate more of it.  My friend told him to taste it and he said that even if I brought you another that it would taste the same.  He didn't try it but walked it to his cooks where I stood up and watched him feed to it them.  They threw it out afterwards.  I'm not sure what that means but he didn't get another entree. To be honest, he was an a**hole.  His staff even came up to us afterwards to apologize.   Bottom line:  none of us will be back because of Brandon."
Rachel G.,"Bay City, MI",19,62,63,3.0,3/28/2016,This place is always crazy busy but if you have never been here go during lunch because it's not as busy. One time I waited three hours during dinner time. I personally never thought the food was anything special it reminds me of a AppleBees or TGI Friday. There is a cheesecake counter where you can order dessert to go which is really the only reason I dine here. I would skip the wait and grab cheesecake to go.
Mrs S.,"Southfield, MI",2,24,5,5.0,8/12/2016,What can say I love the appetizers and of course the cheesecake everyone who works there always has a smile on your face and has a great attitude!
Amy B.,"Rochester, MI",547,1180,306,5.0,11/23/2014,"I LOVE THE CHEESECAKE FACTORY SO MUCH!!  Ok, now I feel better.  I've been coming here for years, and glad that they finally opened one here in Michigan. I've spent the past few years eating at the locations in Phoenix and California, and I've never had a bad time or meal here ever.  Finally made it into this place last night, and what a good time it was. The wait for this place was crazy, and I totally get why.  It was an hour wait on a Saturday afternoon at like 3:30...when does that happen?  We finally got seated around 4:30 and we were so happy to finally be in.  Mind you, my date has never been to the Cheesecake Factory before, so I had to talk him through the whole process of what to expect. The menu is vast and huge, with just about anything for everyone.  The menu reads like a book, with pages and pages of delicious food to choose from.  Steaks, seafood, comfort food and so much more.  They also have a good selection of drinks as well, but I passed this evening. We started with these tater tot thingies and they were awesome. Came with a white dipping sauce and we went nuts.  Mind you, we were famished, so that didn't help either.  My date went with the Chicken Tortilla wraps and I went with the Americana Burger for our main entree's. We could barely finish our food, and it was so good! Our server was awesome. We started out with this one girl and they switched shifts half way through.  Both girls were awesome, very attentive and took excellent care of us.  You wouldn't have thought they were busy as they were with the awesome service we received. I will say this location is a good size, but the one's I've been to out west are at least double the size.  I don't know that it really affects anything, but I'm used to the ones that are bigger.  Place is well decorated with a decent but small sized bar.  Lobby area can get congested if it's busy like it was last night. I'm really glad the cheesecake factory is here and I will be back in the future!"
Annette J.,"Brighton, MI",0,14,,1.0,3/4/2017,"Totally mismanaged, understaffed, untrained, unprofessional bunch of bumbling misfits. Completely clueless, I could go on and on, they should not get even one star, food is only good at best, if that. Would rate minus 10 stars if available. Totally a ""b"" staff at best! All need restaurant training 101, try looking it up, and ""F"" grade all the way around! I will never be back!"
Prerak P.,"Toledo, OH",31,35,,1.0,2/4/2017,"I have been to this place more than 3 times but my last visit was terrible. From food to customer service, everything went wrong. First off, we ordered pasta with roasted garlic but there was no roasted garlic in the pasta so that was replaced. The replaced pasta was undercooked. When we told that to our server, she did not even apologize and started giving excuses. Eventually she took it back. We ordered plates to share food and our plates were not entirely clean; we felt there were very tiny food particles on the plates. We complained about the plates to the server but again no apology and more excuses. Eventually the plates were replaced with new ones which weren't any different. Empty glasses of water were never refilled even after sitting there for an hour. We were so frustrated that we had to speak with the manager about this. The appetizers and cheesecakes were great; at least no complaints on that part."
Stacy W.,"Lansing, MI",28,6,3,4.0,11/13/2016,Only been to one other Cheesecake Factory and that was years ago. And with that being said I was happy with my dining experience. The hostess quoted 30 minute waited more like 10-15. Not shabby for a Sunday afternoon. Server was friendly and helpful. Shared a salad and a couple apps that were tasty. Portion size is large in my opinion. Talked with a couple next to us about their order that looked delicious. (Shrimp and Chicken Gumbo)Will try on another visit. No complaints and can't wait to dig into my cheesecake later tonight.
Samia B.,"Dearborn Heights, MI",16,79,151,3.0,9/7/2016,"Ridiculous wait. Put our name on the list. Had to wait 15 minutes to go back for a pager. Then another hour to be seated. Luckily we got waters right away. Ordered the crab wontons which lacked flavor but had a good texture and good dipping sauce. Also ordered the avocado egg rolls, which are my favorite. Ordered the grilled chicken tostada salad but ordered shrimp instead. I received 4 pieces of shrimp that had the tail on and were beyond small. So over cooked they tasted like rubber. I saw the vinaigrette but couldn't taste it whatsoever. Took awhile to get our server to order a different dressing. I went for the peanut lime dressing they have which was much better. Our server was nice but not very attentive. She forgot our order of sweet potato fries which we were actually happy about because we definitely over ordered. She never filled our waters even after we ordered cheesecake. In conclusion...dinner is not worth the wait. Just get the cheesecake that's why they get 3 stars from me. Previous reviews are pretty accurate.  The place isn't worth waiting for."
Juston M.,"Ferndale, MI",153,408,7,2.0,11/12/2015,"went for the first time ever and tried a bunch of appetizers. these included an eggroll selection, pretzel chicken, fried mac n cheese, some clam chower and something else i can't remember. i really liked the southwestern eggrolls, but disliked the others in the selection. the rueben eggroll was weird. the pretzel chicken was dry, the mac n cheese was pretty good. and unfortunately i was too stuffed to try the cheesecake. after living this long and never trying the cheesecake factory, i guess i was expecting something really great. it's more like a cleaner, overly decorated applebees. the wait is horrendous also. not sure why people get so excited about it. love, juston"
Cristy C.,"Lansing, MI",58,30,168,3.0,3/12/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory is the Cheesecake Factory. Pretty much the same everywhere. A little over priced, the food is a little overrated, there is always a longer wait than you expect. That being said, there is comfort in consistency. A big plate of eggplant parm will most likely be exactly the same in Chicago or Novi, and that isn't a bad thing. It can be a dinner, and your leftovers can be lunch the next day. The decor reminds me a little of something you would find at Disney World- also not a bad thing."
Cheryl M.,"Novi, MI",0,16,1,4.0,4/2/2016,Food is amazing but the timing for your food can often be ridiculously lengthy . The staff is friendly as long as they are waiting on you.  The wait for a table is very long and they don't take reservations. I will say though that is usually the case for a great restaurant.
Sarah A.,"Macomb, MI",0,15,,3.0,9/30/2016,"I love the food here and it is by far one of my favorite chain restaurants. However this location is a little lacking. I was on crutches during my last visit and I could not believe how unsuitable the restaurant is for handicap and elderly customers!  The main entrance door does not have an automatic handicap opener! I had to struggle with the door until another customer walked by and offered help. Another issue I came upon was when I went to use the restroom. Again, I had to manually open an extremely heavy door while balancing my weight on crutches! There was no one around to assist me so I was forced to put my self I'm an unsafe situation. I am surprised that The Cheesecake Factory is not required to have automatic openers on their entrance and bathroom doors. What exacerbates the problem is the fact that their doors are incredibly heavy! The Cheesecake Factory needs to do a better job at taking care of their customers who need a little extra assistance. Shame on them for not being handicap accessible and forcing such customers to wait and depend on the kindness of others to open the door."
Virginia C.,"Grand Blanc, MI",1,10,16,4.0,6/11/2015,"First time at this Cheesecake Factory and I'm pleasantly surprised. I used to love Cheesecake Factory when we traveled outside of Michigan, but started hating it because of the endless menu and huge portions. But my experience today was pretty nice. We had calamari and the French country salad for an appetizer. The calamari was hot, crispy, and not too salty and was fried in clean oil. The salad was alright nothing too special. I ordered it for the beets but the beets were underdone for my taste.  I ordered a lunch portion of spaghetti and meatballs, but as expected it was still a huge portion. It was very delicious. The noodles were perfectly al dente, the sauce had a strong basil flavor, and the meatballs were meaty and soft without being mealy. The only thing is that it needed a little bit more sauce. The fried basil garnish was a nice touch. Also everything was hot as food should be.  The jambalaya Cajun pasta was a little disappointing. Very spicy, but that was about the only flavor it had. The grilled steak medallions on the ""skinnylicious"" menu was the only thing we ordered that was a reasonable portion size. I purposefully never order low fat, low carb, lighter fare options based on the concern that the food will lack flavor, but it seems that the lighter fare menu here is just slightly lower fat, but mainly smaller portions. Which is wonderful.  Our server did a nice job as well. Polite and attentive. However I didn't like that we had to ask for bread instead of it just being provided. But don't hesitate to ask for it. The brown bread they have doesn't seem to be a rye bread, but it has a sweet chocolate flavor, which sounds weird but I had nearly 3 pieces, with butter oops...  Oh also we shared a tiramisu cheesecake which was so so good. I couldn't believe how yummy it was. It was a little lighter than a typical cheesecake which was needed after a big lunch.  Overall great experience. Would come again."
Miranee C.,"Macomb, MI",2,5,3,5.0,4/27/2015,Went there last night -- Sunday & the wait for a table (party of 4) was 80 minutes. We didn't mind. ;)  I ordered the combo Steak & Herb Salmon and it was fantastic!!!  Ambiance & service were excellent. Highly recommend!
Kathleen D.,"Whitmore Lake, MI",0,1,,1.0,1/30/2017,"So, so disappointed!!!  I chose Cheesecake Factory to take my daughter to celebrate her 31st birthday.  We had no problem waiting 30+ minutes for a table at 8pm on a Sunday night.... but what followed made me wish we never went. We both ordered our entrees and an appetizer to share clearly expressing no spice on any of the food which was an option according to the waitress. 40 minutes later our food came and BEFORE the appetizer. My daughter's orange chicken meal came as requested but had no sauce, my meal came and was loaded with hot peppers! 10 minutes later our guacamole finally came and was loaded with jalapeños. After talking with the waitress I was informed they couldn't eliminate the peppers from my dish (although she originally said we could) so I reordered a new entree which at the same time we requested the sauce that was missing from my daughter's meal. By the time she received her sauce (20 min later) her entire meal was ice cold and I was still waiting for mine! I tried to eat some of the guacamole as I waited, but just too hot for my liking.  By the time I received my meal my daughter had been long done trying to eat hers as she barely ate any, too cold and just lost her appetite from the experience. My 2nd meal FINALLY came OVER AN HOUR LATER from the time we were seated! I was so frustrated by this point I asked to speak to the manager only to find myself defending our position as he tried to debate our experience which I found to be completely unprofessional! To his defense he credited my daughter's meal and the appetizer. I carried my meal home in a doggy box. We found we were not the only table with issues this night as we watched another table get compensated for their experience and another table receive a series of apologies for theirs....I apologized to my daughter that we never got around to ordering her birthday cheesecake for dessert....I am told it's pretty good... Not planning to go back."
K M.,"Plymouth, MI",0,26,,3.0,10/16/2016,"Most of these reviews are correct. The wait is absolutely horrendous. I can't even remember the wait being that long at the location in downtown Chicago. When we sat down I started to realize why. You spend a good 1 1/2-2 hours on a meal. The waitress was prompt coming over to greet us, but 20 min to get drinks. 10 to order. 30 for food. And I don't think the wait staff is to blame.  They seem to have too many tables and with the restaurant being so large nothing is close.  I knew the waitress didn't forget our drinks, she was simply waiting on the bar. Just like the orders for the cheesecake comes from the separate dessert bar area.  I saw wait staff standing there waiting for the orders. I can't ever justify the wait here, the food is good but it's not that good. People come here for the hype."
Ann W.,"Northville, MI",62,298,973,3.0,9/17/2013,"On a return visit, many of the challenges associated with opening the popular eatery have largely been worked out. The wait was considerably shorter, only 20 minutes during lunch instead of some of the much-longer times reported here. The pace within the restaurant was still fast but more relaxed and less frenetic and confused.   Within the restaurant, diners happily met up with family and friends to share large appetizers, big salads, large-portioned entrées, and luscious desserts. This time around, I had the Mahi Mahi with Shrimp Vera Cruz, a dish that included a small portion of fish, shrimp, several spears of asparagus and white rice in a tomato, olive and caper sauce. This dish is on the separate Skinnylicious menu for diners looking for something healthier or saving calories for the dessert to come. Unfortunately, the fish and asparagus, while well-prepared, were rather bland. The shrimp was crisp and more flavorful. On a mission to taste all the desserts here (I succeeded in sampling all the pizzas and most salads at California Pizza Kitchen so I felt up to the challenge), I tried the Hershey's Bar Chocolate Cheesecake and sampled the Ultimate Red Velvet Cheesecake. Oh my! The chocolate cheesecake featured layers of chocolate cake with chocolate cheesecake in between. Chocolate chips added another chocolately dimension to the dessert. As for the Red Velvet Cheesecake, I might have found a new favorite. The bite that I had was an explosion of yummy flavor. So very good. The waitstaff was friendly, responsive and knowledgeable, and much more confident in the menu (thank you for the dessert recommendation). Take-out continues to be popular - while waiting, I noticed many, many people exiting with large cake boxes and bags of food containers. Management, while not as conspicuous as the last visit, was still visible, warm and welcoming."
Rose C.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,22,8,1.0,9/3/2016,"The WORST service and food ever! I am from NYC and thought the food would be the same quality and it wasn't. Pasta was watery and cheesecake was a waste of a 29 min wait. Waiter took my card for the bill and walked around with it for almost 40 mins and services everyone around me! Such a horrible waitress. Make sure you do not sit at table 37 or any table surrounding it.  Such a bad experience it ruined my entire night. Told the manager and she basically said there's nothing I can do about it... Aka ""who cares"". I will never come back and if you are coming from out of state, take your money elsewhere. Buyer beware."
