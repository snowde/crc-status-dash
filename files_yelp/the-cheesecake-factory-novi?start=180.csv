Cari R.,"Sterling Heights, MI",26,16,,2.0,8/27/2017,"We don't head out to Twelve Oaks often so, I was excited to finally try Cheesecake Factory since I've heard so many raving reviews. We visited on Saturday afternoon and were told that it would be about 35 minutes. We were seated in about 15 minutes which was a nice surprise. The menu is totally overwhelming. I understand it's part of the appeal but really it's too much. We ended up just sharing a few appetizers. Service was very, very slow. It took well over 30 minutes for our appetizers to arrive. We order the Chicken Pot Stickers, which were pretty good, calamari, and chicken samosas. The pot stickers were the only thing that was edible. The chicken samosas were burned and filled with grease, cut into them and the grease just poured out. The calamari was so rubbery that it was nearly impossible to chew. Finished up with a piece of key lime cheesecake and it was okay but not what I would expect from a place that is supposed to be known for its desserts. Overall, were very unimpressed especially for the price."
Ranetta A.,"Ferndale, MI",15,21,96,4.0,1/9/2016,I need to write this review so I can delete some pictures out of my phone. I came here because I happened to be at work and currently this is the only location in Mi. My husband and I came when they first opened and we had a very nice experience so I decided to try their happy hour. I must say I have become a happy hour enthusiast. If I could get a job critiquing food I think I would be in heaven.  On to the review..... I sat at the bar of course and was greeted promptly. I placed my drink order which only consisted of water with lemons. I also ordered a burger med well with fries and crab and spinach dip. The crab dip was to die for. I could eat that any day of the week. It was so flavorful and cheesy. The burger was good but not something that really stood out. The presentation was very nice!! Although I have forgotten my bartenders name she was very courteous and attentive. I definitely will be back!!
Kathy O.,"Canton, MI",20,41,18,5.0,11/30/2014,"I have been to the Cheesecake Factory about three times now. It's almost a given at this point since every time I go, it's with my grandma who takes me out shopping once or twice a year.  I highly enjoy this place. The waitstaff is extremely knowledgeable and professional, the menu is extensive, and the place seems to be run well like clockwork.  I'm a huge pasta person so the carbohydrates are usually what I go for. I've had the Pasta Carbonara twice and it's amazing! The garlic sauce added to the dish is a perfect compliment. I've also tried many of the other dishes since I tend to sample my family's as well. The plates are always very flavorful and delicious!  Now let's get on to why ya'll are really here. The Cheesecake!! I've never been a huge cheesecake person, but this place knocks the dessert of cheesecake out of the frickin park! I've not only been to the Cheesecake Factory in Twelve Oaks, but also to the one in Las Vegas. Both have the same level of divine taste for dessert! My favorite Cheesecake is the Oreo. It's so good and besides I'm obsessed with Oreos. It's not the healthiest thing in the world, but I live with it.  Needless to say, if you've never experienced The Cheesecake Factory, do it. Right now. Why are you still reading this? Go, right now and do it. It's delicious and needs to be tried at least once. There's a reason The Cheesecake Factory has places all over the country. Now go get some bomb-diggity Cheesecake!"
Liz P.,"Clawson, MI",618,1174,2387,4.0,11/15/2013,"I LOVE the Cheesecake Factory and was so happy when they opened one in Michigan finally. It opened in August and I didn't get there until today, because of the crazy lines... Finally got my parents to wait in line today and I skipped out of work a bit early.  (they got there around 230pm and would have been seated around 345pm, by the way, which isn't awful. This was a Friday afternoon. They only seat you when your whole party is there, though, so we were seated at 415pm when I arrived)  I got my favorite dish, the Pasta da Vinci. For dessert we ordered a slice of the Caramel Pecan Turtle cheesecake and one of the Adam's peanut butter. Caramel one was just okay, the PB one was good.  Waitstaff was very nice and on top of things for the most part. I did order no onions in my pasta and got onions, but not a big deal.  As much as I love CF, I'm going to wait a bit before going back. It was just too crowded for my taste, and normally I don't have an extra 2 hours to spare. But definitely go if you have the time (and money, because CF is expensive, too - $11.95 for lunch portions though you get a lot of food, $7.50 per cheesecake slice)."
Nishant K.,"Novi, MI",8,5,1,2.0,9/7/2016,"It sucks to say this, but tonight was horrible! The waitress was rude and raised her voice at my wife when she asked for. Refill, no big deal, then our food was greasy and cold, and they couldn't even get the food out on time. We sent back the buffalo blast because it was mostly fried stuff and less filling... Tex met egg rolls were greasy also. Mac n cheese was good and cheesecake was good... I don't know what's going on. Maybe they shouldn't take loyal customers for granted... Hope this review helps"
Thomas B.,"Grand Blanc, MI",23,205,44,4.0,1/30/2016,"I have been to I think four of these locations and although I really do enjoy their food, I truly do not appreciate the long lines and extreme waits for the food.  The company really needs to take a look at increasing guest satisfaction by expansion and not making their restaurants a destination location.  I mean it is DINNER not DISNEY!    Enough Said!"
J J.,"Novi, MI",0,5,,1.0,3/21/2017,"Unbelievably terrible managment.  Went to have dinner and the wait was 45 min.  Decided to just get a take out cheesecake instead of waiting.  Stood in line, paid almost $20 for 2 slices.  Expecting to get the cheesecake I was told it would be 10 minutes. 10 minutes, for what?  Most places you pay and get your product.  No.  4 frickin 5, 45! minutes later we get our overpriced, just out of the freezer cheesecake.  If I had not paid already I would have left.  That's why they make you wait.  Wow, ruined our night out.  And to top it off, the slices were so tiny and the taste was not good, cheap ingredients."
R J.,"White Lake, White Lake charter Township, MI",0,2,,1.0,3/18/2017,"I came here with some work colleagues recently and we had a horrible experience. One of the dinners was not brought out until the rest of us had finished eating. On top of that, the dinner was not even what he had ordered. We all ordered cheesecake slices to go, and three of us received the wrong cheesecakes, but were not aware until we got home."
Jacquelyn D.,"Grand Rapids, MI",1,27,,4.0,2/5/2017,We had great service and excellent food.  I did have to ask for part of my meal 3 times which delayed our getting back on the road but the rest of the visit was wonderful.
Sasha W.,"Detroit, MI",385,2,,1.0,10/2/2016,"Worst management ive ever had to deal with. Was told almost immediately while complaining about my food coming out wrong, twice, that i would not receive any compensation, where i never ask for any. Unbelievable."
R S.,"Mason, MI",0,3,,1.0,6/14/2016,"I have eaten at The Cheesecake Factory several times- both at this location and others. We don't live close to Novi, but we like the restaurant enough to drive over an hour to dine with them. But, my last visit was more than displeasing. First, my server was obnoxious, unorganized, and very slow. He forgot our drinks. We had to remind him to bring us bread. He completely forgot my salad, which was the main part of my dish (pizza and salad). And, after the meal, he counted the money directly on the table which was very odd.  The WORST part of my last experience happened after I left the restaurant. I got home and began to eat my leftover pizza. I realized that there was something hard and sharp on it, and I PULLED OUT A PIECE OF HARD PLASTIC- IN MY PIZZA! It was about 1""X1/2"" and it was sharp. It must have chipped off of something. I was frustrated and immediately called the restaurant. The manager was not helpful. He told me that these things happen and that they're hard to avoid. He also told me that just today, they also found a MARBLE in another dish they served. He didn't offer to fix the problem by offering a coupon or a reimbursement or even an apology.  This seriously makes me question the conditions my food was prepared in. Not only did the management not seem surprised or concerned with the potentially dangerous contamination to my food.  Although I will miss the good food I have had in the past at The Cheesecake Factory. I will NOT be eating there again."
Ashley H.,"Las Vegas, NV",16,123,186,1.0,8/16/2015,"Where shall one reviewer begin? I will begin by saying that this location does not meet the standards that other Cheesecake Factory's uphold and deliver. The first issue that I have with this location is that is completely out of ADA compliance. If someone in your party is in a wheelchair or needs additional assistance, this location is not equip to accommodate them. For example, there is no where for them to sit nor stand and not be in the walk way blocking traffic, unless they are to sit outside of the restaurant along the valet corner.  Next, I am understand that because this is only location in Michigan there will be a wait, heck at every Cheesecake Factory their is a wait, but over a 2 hour wait during a weekday afternoon is ridicules. However, once seated the food leaves much to be desired. It's not your traditional Factory level food.  Lastly, the hostess and the to-go sections of the restaurant need additional training. While placing an order to-go for an elderly individual who is wheelchair bond, the representative Deani explained to me that she could not place the order for this person unless she can physically see them. I explained that the person is waiting outside the restaurant because they are unable to come into the restaurant due to the crowd and lack of mobility to move around. She then said, ""well have them role in and then have them stand-up out of their chair so that I may see them."" After that statement, I left the restaurant. It truly sad that Michigan finally received a great restaurant during their reconstruction and it's one of my favorite restaurants as well, but after this I believe my love for Cheesecake Factory has come to an end!"
Jeff D.,"Brighton, MI",0,11,14,5.0,9/10/2016,"The Wait is worth the great service, food, drink's and dessert. They have a very wide range of dishes, something for everyone.  I haven't had a bad meal yet."
Rebecca W.,"Southfield, MI",34,125,169,2.0,10/26/2014,"I was not impressed the entrées took a long time to arrive at our table. They lay the silverware on the table as place setting. Not good! The Shrimp and steak Diane was a big let down. 3 shrimp and a couple of chunks of steak mixed with mushrooms, the rest of the plate was mashed potatoes  The Bang Bang Chicken: sauce was delicious though not enough the weird thing about it were pools of grease in it. Rice rational far exceeds the rest of the meal.  I've had tastier meals."
Elizabeth D.,"Reno, NV",26,203,89,3.0,9/1/2014,"I used to love the Cheesecake Factory, so I was super excited when I heard a CF was opening in Michigan. Now, it's just A-OK, especially considering the prices. Yes, the portions are huge, so you can pretty much count on taking home at least half of your meal. But, perhaps because my tastes have changed over the years, I don't find the Cheesecake Factory food as satisfying anymore. There's nothing terribly wrong with their food. It's just not great or something you'd want to go out of your way for. We ordered: 1. the avocado eggrolls, which probably wouldn't be so great without the sweet sauce that comes with it. 2. chicken and biscuits; chicken and veggies (carrots, peas, and mushrooms) were delicious but the biscuit could have been fresher. 3. fried shrimp platter with french fries and coleslaw; the fried shrimp tasted just salty on their own, not much flavor; but at least they weren't overcooked. Of course, their desserts are great. Service was friendly and attentive. I wouldn't object if someone wanted to come here, but this wouldn't be first on my list of places to go out for food that's worth the price."
Ahmed E.,"Bloomfield Hills, MI",10,28,16,2.0,7/5/2014,"I've been here twice, there is always a long wait and the restaurant is really loud so you have to tell across the table to have a simple conversation.  The second time my wife and I came here, they messed up my wife's order, but the waitress was having a bad day so we told her to bring out the dinner anyway and just give us a free cheesecake, which she happily did. I had the salmon with mashed potatoes and asparagus, and ended up with food poisoning.  The food was good and the cheesecake is great, but I'll never be eating here again."
Robert J.,"New Hudson, Lyon Charter Township, MI",0,20,,2.0,3/4/2017,"Poor service, crowded.  Very expensive for what you get. Food is standard.   Been twice, won't return."
Sascha H.,"Southfield, MI",3,8,2,4.0,3/3/2016,A big choice of food and as well a menu for low calorie food. The american cheese cake is awesome and I enjoyed the time. Waitress was nice and polite as well. Good place to get different choices of american cheese cake like oreo cheese cake etc.
Becky W.,"Gaylord, MI",2,6,,1.0,4/10/2016,So over rated pasta was mushy and tomatoes tasted like they were out of a can. Service was very average expected more.
William L.,"Waterford Township, MI",0,12,,1.0,2/28/2017,After getting seated we waiting 25mins to put our drink order in then it was another 40mins until our food arrived to which the food was cold and instead of a well done cheeseburger it was still raw. Add on another 20mins to get our check and another 15mins to pay it adds up to an 1hour 40mins of a really bad dinning experience coupled with the 90min wait for a table...get you guessed it I will not be risking or wasting my time coming back. The actually cheesecake itself was okay about the same as you'd get at a Fridays or Applebee's.
