T M.,"Atlanta, GA",0,13,,1.0,12/17/2016,"We went at lunch time. We asked for a high chair for our 17 month old. They said no problem. We sat and waited for 5 minutes and they couldn't find a high chair. I walked around and saw 1 high chair in use. Needless to say, we couldn't stay and eat comfortably. We left. Seems to be a trendy place, but needs better service."
Cici C.,"Rochester, MI",4,6,,1.0,6/19/2016,"I planned a news nice Father's Day brunch with my husband and children but...  We didn't mind the 15 minute wait, but then we waited 15 minutes for our waitress, 20 minutes for our drinks and another 15 minutes for bread. Once our food arrived 35 minutes later the orders were wrong and luke warm."
joan w.,"Southfield, MI",0,1,,1.0,6/15/2017,"The worst service I've ever received, opt not to stay and order, manager wasn't helpful or accommodating, and I would suggest retraining your hostess staff in proper etiquette and procedures when seating your quest needless to say I would never return or have anything positive to say about your Establishment, upon reading other reviews on your page I will agree your staff is very RACIST the exact same thing happen to us we were told we were next and while we standed there 4 other Caucasian couple was seated ahead of us, when we asked what was going on there were many excuses,such as they call our name and someone else got up and went in our place the only problem with that was we were standing there the whole time and our name wasn't called,the shocked I felt because I knew we there before them as my other party went ahead of me to get an table, and I walked in just ahead of the Caucasian couple that was seated, we ignored it and kept waiting , then another few people were sat that again came in after us, finally my partner asked what's going on then more people walked in was also sat before us again,the female hostess told us they are waiting on a booth,we never asked for a booth or table after we final got an table 15 minutes no one greeted or approached our table,which was a booth immediately next to the kitchen, while observing many other open tables and booths when we stopped the manager Brandon he was not helpful and gave me the impression that he did not care or was he concerned about the behavior of your host staff he acted as if it we were a bother , having one unhappy customer is bad, just imagine how fast the word spreads from one person being unhappy ,I won't have a problem spending my money elsewhere,"
Danielle K.,"Farmington Hills, MI",8,4,4,5.0,4/3/2014,I guess it's hard to please cheap people around the area. Let me start off; the food is incredibly good including desert. I've been here twice already and it gets better for me all the time.  Yes there's a wait and yes they don't take reservations but you need to be patient and have to use your head that it's the only Cheesecake Factory in Michigan and other people want to eat there too.  Appetizers: I recommend the fried calamari and the flat bread. It was so good! And for the meal: steak Diane with the Samon and mashed potatoes UGH SO GOOD!!!
Megan R.,"Belleville, MI",26,25,62,3.0,7/5/2016,Food is aways great when we go.  If you go at the wrong time (Sunday dinner) it is too busy and too load.  But good for them they're making sales.  Only real complaint I have is it is kinda pricey for what you get.  Sunday I ordered the Garlic Pasta. 15 dollars for spaghetti noodles and a few pieces of asparagus and could be wrong but what tasted liked canned diced tomato's.  It was good but did not look like a 15 dollar plate of pasta.   Today i ordered just the fried zucchini and it was great priced at 6.98.   So just depends on what ya get.   Again foods great just pricey.  Also waitresses were awesome.
Grace L.,"Detroit, MI",75,359,160,3.0,8/16/2015,"This was my first experience at a Cheesecake Factory and boy, my sister was not kidding ... this place serves EVERYTHING. We came around 11:45 on a Saturday and fortunately beat the lunch rush by a bit. The waitstaff seated us right away and our bread and water came immediately to our table. The waitress we had was pretty helpful in narrowing down some of her favorite dishes which was super helpful. The food took about 1/2 an hour to reach our table. We only ordered the beef tacos, a salad, a Bacon-Bacon burger, and eggplant parm. The kitchen seemed swamped as we noticed the people around us either got their food late or incorrectly. The steak tacos were delicious - the meat tender, toppings fresh. The rice and beans weren't anything to rave about. The southwest salad was really delicious! I liked the large crispy tortilla chip at the bottom that added extra crunch. The eggplant parmesan was rich and tasty, and my Bacon-Bacon burger was nommy! There was so much bacon on it and the bacon was fatty, sweet, savory, and super crispy. It was pretty filling lunch but we knew we couldn't leave without topping off our experience with some cheesecake. We ordered a slice of the blueberry white chocolate cheesecake and it was a great decision. It was not overwhelmingly sweet like some of the chocolate based options can be and the fruit added some good acidity to cut the richness of the chocolate and cheese. Yum! Definitely will be back, but will now know to expect the slower kitchen response time."
Suzanne S.,"Canton, MI",638,203,394,4.0,4/5/2014,"Hello Yelpers,  OHHH YEA....I was so happy to find out that the ""Cheescake factory"" was here in MIchigan.   We arrived at a good time, for a new restaurant like this, because everyone wants to try it.. We went on a Sunday and I Tried the chicken picatta, because that's what I always get when we are in Scottsdale, AZ. I love this restaurant in AZ so I just knew I'd love it here as well.. But the Picatta was a bit  too lemony & mushroomy for me ! The one in Scottsdale AZ was better so far...at least for the Picatta dinner.   I did send that back...but the waitress was so kind and the staff was very nice and they wanted to please me and us. So I ordered the ""applesauce pancakes""...OMG...they were so good, I couldn't get enough. I took about 1/2 of it home to save for later. I got to enjoy it twice. It wasn't like any kind of pancakes I'd ever had before.  There were these great big fluffy pancakes and the sauce is really the restaurants ""applesauce recipe"".  But to me it tasted like the insides of an apple pie.   Not just any apple pie, but the very best apple pie you'd ever tasted in your life.  I'm not kidding, this was soo yummy, it melted in my mouth and I just couldn't wait to go back and get it again.   Sadly, I have to tell you that we went back another time and they took these favorite pancakes off of the menu. I guess other people didn't think it was as delectible as I thought it was.  But there are so many other entree's on the menu that I'm sure you 'll find something pleasing to your taste buds.  Right now while this venue is a new spot to eat, the lines are really long and the waiting time is evenn longer. But you can go on a Sunday about 11:00 am and not have too long of a wait time.  Im sure after it's there awhile, the waiting times will go down.  My husband had the baked macaroni and cheese and it was excellent too. I  tasted it and It was full of cheese and flavor! I absolutely will have that the next time we go to this restaurant. Believe me, we will be going back.  I must add that all the wait staff and the hostesses were very kind and friendly as well. I had been looking for a refill on my diet pepsi and another waitress just brought it for me without me having to ask.  Our waitress was knowledgeable and kind."
Rebecca C.,"Ferndale, MI",386,181,8,2.0,1/14/2014,"I won't even lie: I was as excited as everyone else that Michigan finally got a Cheesecake Factory. I've been to the locations in Chicago and Fort Lauderdale, and remember them fondly.  So why was I horribly underwhelmed with last night's dinner? After a 50 minute wait, we were seated. We started with an appetizer of fried macaroni and cheese (my mom's request). They were....weird. We were served 4 baseball sized macaroni and cheese balls. There was a bit of tomato sauce on the plate (still not sure if it was a garnish, or a dip). They were tasty, but gave me an instant stomachache. For dinner, I had the chile rellenos burger. Chile Rellenos is my absolute favorite food to order at Mexican restaurants, so I thought I'd give it a go. The pepper was stuffed with cream cheese, like a jalapeno popper. It wasn't horrible, but it definitely wasn't what I thought it would be.  My mom ordered the Bellagio Chicken. It was bright green because of the pesto they used. They also covered the entire dish in basil. It looked like a big green mess (and I love pesto).  My daughter ordered the cheeseburger sliders, which came out with no cheese. We sent it back and they promptly fixed it. For dessert, we had the smores cheesecake - which was amazing. Fantastic. I can't say enough words to describe how delicious this was.  The bill for two adults and one child was $60. We didn't have any alcohol.  Pricey and underwhelming. I'd go back for the cheesecake...provided someone else was paying."
Brett C.,"Brighton, MI",102,47,5,5.0,3/13/2015,"Do yourself a favor and put The Cheesecake Factory on your bucket list. Heaven on earth in many ways.  So, my wife and I visited this location at 3 PM on a Wednesday. From what I've heard, any time during a dinner rush and you'll be waiting in line like it's the Maverick at Cedar Point. We saw the hostess, got on the list, and got buzzed to our table roughly 10 minutes after we got in. It was pretty steady for a late lunch crowd.  Service was fantastic and the little details were notes thoroughly (cooking preferences, side items, etc.) I had the fish tacos and my wife had the macaroni and cheese burger. The food was literal perfection in every way: temperature, taste, texture. It was all amazing.  And what's a trip to The Cheesecake Factory without a slice? I shied away from my normal Tiramisu flavor and went with Pineapple Upside Down cheesecake this time. It was light and rich all at the same time.  Make it a priority and sit down for a meal here. You won't be disappointed."
Laura Y.,"Atlanta, GA",49,127,984,2.0,12/24/2013,I'm only rating the cheesecake. I have only had a hand-full of dishes from here and the food is just ok. The cheesecakes are frozen and made in a factory in another state!! they are over priced for the quality. If you want a great cheesecake try Peteets cheesecakes in Oak Park.
Shakeila M.,"Wyoming, MI",1,6,10,5.0,9/27/2015,"The wait was over an hour but it was well worth it! The menu had so many options it was very hard to make a decision!! However I ended selecting the Cajun jambalaya pasta! It was delicious, seasoned & cooked perfectly!! The service was also great!! Ok now let's get the the famous cheesecake desert!! We prefer the turtle cheesecake!! It was simply ok! It didn't taste homemade, it rather tasted like it was bought & not prepared in house! Maybe we selected the wrong type of cheesecake!! We are definitely going back & will try a different type of cheesecake desert!!"
Jasmine D.,"Waterford Township, MI",35,72,315,3.0,7/19/2015,"The food was very tasty, although I wasn't really impressed with the service this time. Our waitress who's name was Amanda seemed to be overwhelmed or something because she wasn't really attentive to our needs. I asked her for sweetener for my tea and she said one second. Then she went and took the order of two other tables. By the time she brought my sweetener, my tea was cold. It will probably be s while before I come back. It was good but not that good."
K K.,"Walled Lake, MI",16,30,,3.0,2/18/2015,"This restaurant is a little complicated.  I had never been to one until recently (this one opened up 5 minutes from my home, and I watch The Big Bang Theory), so I had to try it out.  When it first opened, it quickly became famous for having 3 hour seating waits (for people to wait that long... must be incredible right?).  The first time I dined there I was given an old Sears Christmas Catalog.  Oh wait... that's the menu!  It's a big menu.  When I quizzically commented on the size of the menu, the waitress proudly exclaimed ""Yep, 365 menu items for you to choose from"".  My wife and I looked at each.  I was worried.  Knowing a little bit about the restaurant biz, the general motto for menu size is ""the bigger the menu the worse the food"".    After having eaten there about 10 times now, I can make some comments that I believe to be true. Their food is actually pretty good.  It's not 'wait 3 hours' good, but I never have a bad dish, and some dishes are incredible.  They get around making bad food from a large menu by loading their dishes with fat.  And I can't stress this enough.  They use heavy cream, cheese, oils, sugar, and salt so generously you would think they owned stock in them.  Their serving sizes are also quite generous.  When you get people addicted to trans fat and sugar, yes they will flock to you.  But the menu size also contributes to the long waits at this restaurant as the kitchen is accommodating an incredible number of varying orders.   Now there are some healthy items if you really look for them.  The Thai Chicken Lettuce Wraps are delicious and weight watcher friendly.  There is a ""skinnylicious"" menu there, but BIG WARNING here - they just replace fat with salt - A LOT of salt.   In short, I eat here occasionally, but purposely avoid it sometimes for health reasons. If you don't care about your health and what you put in your body, this is a fantastic restaurant - the dishes only go from good to great, the portion sizes are huge, and the deserts are straight out of Willy Wonka's dreams."
Maggie B.,"Aurora, IL",52,17,1,2.0,2/29/2016,Nothing about this place is worth the wait. Period. The food was meh. The service was about the best thing going for the place. I had the crab cake bites and the avocado salad. It was the only thing that jumped out on the menu at me and it was just barely. For a three hour wait you'd expect to see a menu full of stuff you have never tried before but their menu was very disappointing to me. I will never go back.
A B.,"Livonia, MI",0,11,,5.0,8/21/2015,"Went on a very busy Thursday afternoon with colleagues, the wait was reasonable and honestly expected with the crowd the way it was.  Seated within the amount of time in which we were told. Were approached very promptly by our server. She was very sweet and knew the menu and the specials for the day.  The food was there in record time for the amount of guest in the establishment. Our drinks were constantly refilled.  The food was awesome everyone liked what they ordered.  If you are going here especially around the weekend prepare yourself for a wait and have realistic expectations. Also if this is your first time or it's been awhile check out the menu online so you are not overwhelmed."
Erica F.,"Farmington, MI",65,62,11,4.0,1/9/2015,"When this place opened, I was working retail at the mall, we had so many customers solely because they were on the wait list at The Cheesecake Factory and it was a 6-8 hour wait, no joke. This place was a huge addition to Twelve Oaks. I went with a couple friends, and this was my first time to a Cheesecake Factory. It was a year after they opened so there was no crazy wait time, and it was summer, so they had very nice outdoor seating. We ended up sitting outside, it was a very nice day. We sat under a big umbrella in what was like a big outdoor booth. I ordered the pretzel crusted chicken strips, which is an appetizer. I didn't enjoy them as much as I thought I would, and the presentation wasn't exactly appetizing... They were served on wood skewers and one of them broke inside the chicken, so I was afraid I was going to eat part of the stick. This is why I gave four out of five stars! The waitress was great, even when she was waiting on multiple tables she made time to refill our drinks quickly and was knowledgeable about the menu. We ordered cheesecake, and I am not a cheesecake person, but I tried a couple bites, and it was great. It was the S'Mores cheesecake, it looked almost too good to eat, but we devoured it within minutes. Beautiful place, I didn't get to venture to the back of the restaurant, mainly the outdoor seating, bathrooms and bar area. I'd definitely go back again, just not at a busy time!"
Marie D.,"Lathrup Village, MI",0,4,3,1.0,10/13/2016,They are the worse need better organization when it comes to the carry out and this was not the best location to put this fountain walk was the better choice if they had an option
Dianne V.,"Westland, MI",0,7,1,2.0,10/21/2016,"Very disappointed with this branch. I went there the other day with a couple of friends and the service we received was horrible. So i ordered the chicken and biscuit, the chicken was burnt at the bottom and they smothered sauce all over it so i wont notice the burnt part, and the plating was so horrible it looked like a big plate of slop! Thats not it, so my food came first while my friends' food didn't come out till 10 mins later. When they got their food, the sides that they ordered was in the other persons plate. So they had to re- plate everything which took another 5 mins or so. The service was just bad all around. They weren't even that busy to mess up that much. It just seems so unorganized. The only reason they are getting 2 stars is coz the cheesecake never changed. I used to love the cheesecake factory, but now I'm not so sure if i still do."
Panagiota Z.,"Canton, MI",47,20,65,5.0,9/6/2013,I was in the mall with my mom looking for shoes and decided we wanted a piece of cheesecake. We did carry out and were surprised as to how fast we got our order in and our food ready to go. The staff was also really friendly. The dine-in side had about an hour wait- which is very reasonable as seeing how packed the place was!  The interior looks amazing!! I'm so happy to finally have a Cheesecake Factory by me (AND in Novi- instead of the Eastside!!!!!)  I'll definitely be going for dinner soon.
Ly P.,"Royal Oak, MI",3,8,,3.0,2/5/2016,"I took my boyfriend here for his birthday, and I knew there was going to be a wait because i mean common now... who doesn't love cheesecake and shopping. They said it would be a 30 minute wait but we actually only waited 15 minutes for a table which was awesome!!, the host guy was very attentive and polite, he was very patient and knew how to talk to the larger parties as i watched him (like a weirdo I am) Anyway, While we were seated our server was very nice and she knew the menu, she was attentive and made sure we had our drinks filled while we waited for our food to come out. The service was excellent. The establishment decor is just amazing and beautiful but, for a place that looks so fancy the one thing i was very sad about was the food. Their menu was extensive!!! A LOT of items to choose from and pretty much anything to fit your cravings for dinner. We ordered the spinach dip and the fried zucchini as our appetizers and it was just not up to par. The spinach dip was soup like consistency, it was like they opened a jar of garlic sauce and added spinach and artichokes to it. And the zucchini were soggy. Our entrees were very bland and tasteless. Overall the food was OK  But when it came to the deserts... ALWAYS order their cheesecake. It was the highlight of our evening!! IT was so delicious and even if you don't like cheesecake i recommend you trying the cheesecake here!!"
