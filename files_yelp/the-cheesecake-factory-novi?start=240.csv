Alex R.,"Plymouth, MI",95,61,217,5.0,5/16/2015,Excellent restaurant. Nice variety. Prepared well with fresh ingredients. Cheesecake is awesome. Service professional. Near perfect.
Christian C.,"Waterford Township, MI",49,46,83,3.0,8/15/2013,"So my friends convinced  me to go on opening day which was a big mistake. The line was literally wrapped around the world! It felt like I took 3 trains, 2 busses and a helicopter just to get to the front of the line. But on a positive note, the food was really good. I'm not sure if they'll be this crowded every day, because like I said I went on opening day, but go at your own risk, and may the odds be in your favor."
Charity F.,"Southfield, MI",44,75,102,4.0,5/4/2015,"The cheesecake factory is nothing really to get overly excited about. Its your standard American fare  favorites that range from pasta, burritos to orange chicken. The portions are large so bring an empty stomach. But not too empty because the waits are still pretty long. For our party of 6 we waited and hour to be seated. Once seated I would say it took 30 minutes for our food once the order was placed. And another 30 minutes for our cheesecakes that we ordered to go. Our waiter was great; made sure we had refills and plenty of bread as we waited. Now to the good stuff our food. I ordered the chicken Bellagio which I wanted to sub the cream sauce it comes with for Alfredo sauce. I had this dish before and didn't care for the sauce it came with. It wasn't thick enough for my liking. I get my plate eat some of it and realize it wasn't Alfredo sauce. Huge disappointment but since I didnt want to wait another long time for the correction I just sucked it up and decide just set it aside and safe room for cheesecake. My mother ordered  the burrito which was surprisingly good. I would def give that a try next time. My sister had there steak Diane and chicken Madeira which are favorites of mine. Absolutely love the sauces on them. My uncle had their Shepard's pie which he enjoyed. The cheesecakes were delicious as usual. The food is really good here despite me receiving the wrong sauce. Its nothing to die for or to wait over an hour for but it is better than your average chain."
Sarai E.,"Oakland, CA",194,17,27,5.0,2/16/2015,I've been here many times and wait times are always long so what I do is usually get a buzzer and my name on the list and go home for an hour or just walk around the mall. This last time i sat at the bar and drank samples of wine until I found the ones I liked and got two bottles of those for my sisters gathering later that night. The bartender was very helpful. The samples were in miniature wine glasses and were free!! Super great service from the bar so I left her a tip!
Fai F.,"Novi, MI",43,188,32,4.0,11/30/2013,"Two days after Thanksgiving?  Everyone is still working on leftovers, so our wait was only 15 minutes!  Since we weren't expecting such a short wait, I asked to be put at the end of the line to do some holiday shopping.  Bought us 45 minutes to peruse at our leisure.   TIP:  Prepare to wait!!  Go straight here, get a little buzzer, go shop the mall and come back.  They aren't taking reservations until after the holidays.   I really enjoyed our whole experience.  The interior design was decadently busy, but a nice contemporary departure from most nicer restaurants in SE Michigan.  Our server was very professional and checked on us often.  When I asked for hot water with lemon (for the tickle in my throat), she thoughtfully brought honey as well.  We sat and chatted for awhile, so we made sure to tip big. Our three person party ordered two salmon plates with vegetables and a Glamburger.  Everyone was content with their food, but I can only speak for my meal.  I ordered the herb crusted salmon with vegetables. The salmon was tender and the loads of vegetables were prepared from scratch (not frozen).  Broccoli, carrots and asparagus in a lemony, cream sauce.  I felt the sauce was a little too sour, but a dish of ranch dressing showed up out of nowhere and we took full advantage of it (seriously, we didn't ask for it, but we didn't say no!).  I'll just be picky here because everything else was really nice. The carrots were a bit more rustic - roughly chopped, and not peeled as cleanly as I would like.  But who really cares, the food was great :) Oh, we were too full to even share a slice of cheesecake, but it was my birthday and they gave me a little birthday sundae on the house.  They even sang for me.  Yae!"
Tara G.,"Detroit, MI",0,13,1,5.0,4/30/2016,Awesome dining & food I enjoy my Chicken Ceasar Salad and the dinner rolls are delish. Will visit again soon.
Deborah H.,"Rochester, MI",0,3,1,1.0,10/28/2016,"So I decided to try something new today. I got the crusted chicken Romano and it was externally salty. The manager came to me and asked me if I had it before, and I told him no. He goes on to tell me that it's an original recipe and that's how it's made. I may not have high blood pressure but that would have given anyone a stroke. My friend got the bacon bacon cheese burger to be safe she asked for medium and for well done. There was also a weird piece of thick cut bacon that looked burnt. Very disappointed with my experience tonight and most definitely will not be back. Was not worth the hour and half wait."
S M.,"Dearborn, MI",0,26,55,3.0,4/27/2015,"I only came to this place because I had a gift card. We ordered a salmon dish and shrimp scallops with steak. Both cake with mashed potatoes. The food was presented very well but didn't have the oomph taste. Everyone takes how amazing this place is but the food was not all that, however it did look good but it tasted like food that you would get from a all u can eat buffet. The food was not that hot when it came out, it was warm, I was able to tell that it was sitting out for a while. We also ordered chicken pretzels and fried mac n cheese balls. The chicken pretzel didn't taste as good as it looked. It tastes like a piece of chicken breast meat that was very fried and crispy. However the sauce that came with it was amazing. The fried mac n cheese was great (they are known for that). The good thing is that there menu is huge and you can pick a from a variety of things. For dessert I got the carrot cake cheesecake! It was amazing! So yummmmy!  If I got next time I will probably have dessert and probably a light appetizer or salad. Not worth dinning in because there food isn't all that."
Msp P.,"Detroit, MI",7,21,31,5.0,8/17/2013,"Always a fan & this location is no different. Very crowded due to opening week & I'm sure it will be that way for a while.  Our wait for a party of 5 was 4 hours. Only complaint I have is that I specifically asked for a certain type of seating arrangement but when we went to get seated it wasn't what I had specified but management quickly fixed it for us.  The servers & service was wonderful. Stacie M was very pleasant & fun.  Macaroni balls were a little cool but delicious, Pasta DaVinci was great.  Patio seating was great but bugs started joining is for dinner about 8pm. Smokers are a pest because they light up not too far from where you are seated.  We had to order cheesecakes with dinner due to back up but they ended up coming right on time.  They attempted to handle the crowds as best as they could.  Can't wait to go back!"
Alana S.,"Livonia, MI",0,8,,1.0,10/22/2016,Not worth the wait which will be about 2 hours! And if you want cheesecake after your dinner they said another 20-30 minutes! My food came out cold and  i had to wait even longer for a new plate. The seats are very uncomfortable and tables are tiny.
Erika T.,"West Bloomfield, MI",6,20,,4.0,5/5/2015,"My husband and I went on a Saturday at about 11:30am and although they were packed, we were seated right away. Our server was great, and kept our drinks full. My husband got the double bacon cheeseburger and he said it was one of the BEST burgers he ever had. I had the homemade veggie burger which WAS the best I've ever had. The green salad that came with my veggie burger was blah. Just greens with some kind of vinaigrette.      We shared a piece of Lemon Meringue Cheesecake and it was the best cheesecake we've ever had, and it better be for $7.99 for one slice.  I give 4 stars instead of 5 because of the salad and very high prices."
Brian M.,"Caro, MI",4,22,,3.0,8/31/2016,"Waitress was great, and we got right in to a table. Food was a different story. We ordered an appetizer only to be told 20 minutes later that they didn't have any more prepared for the day, and that they tried making a fresh batch, and it wasn't working. We went with a different appetizer which was good. We then ordered 2 steak dianes for our entree. Ordered them both medium and they came out well done. Manager came out and told us they would be making us fresh and correct ones. Our waitress came out and told us a little bit later that our steaks were still coming, but they had overcooked the replacements. We ended up ordering cheesecakes and having them box up our steaks as we had already eaten the rest of the entrees. Manager comped those for us due to the screw ups. Staff were amazing, but the food is overpriced. Get a lot more at other restaurants for the same price. Probably won't go back, unless I have money to waste."
Crystal W.,"Westland, MI",30,76,7,4.0,11/10/2014,"I was so excited when we finally got or very own Cheesecake Factory.  I love cheesecake!  Unfortunately, I haven't had great luck with the regular food.  I've tried 4 different menu items as the main course and have liked none of them. This place gets very crowded, quickly.  They open at 11 AM.  I always get there right after they open.  You have your best chance of getting in without waiting. As far as they cheesecake, I've yet to have a bad slice.  My personal favorite is the Godiva cheesecake, (I'm not willing to share it).  My daughters and husband love the Oreo Extreme Cheesecake. My two recommendations for this place is to go early, and remember that you're their for the cheesecake!"
Tony W.,"Birmingham, MI",12,1,,1.0,10/2/2016,Just left Cheesecake Factory for a birthday party arrive at 545 seated at 810pm split the party up after dinner saw hostess in bathroom was told there was a human error per the hostess so I  asked to speak to the manager Brandon Kincaid.  He was very rude obnoxious. I asked him about the wait time and immediately in his second sentence to me stated I am not giving you anything. I replied that is very offensive I didn't ask you for anything in fact I had already paid my bill he then stated he wouldn't speak to me anymore and walked away from me I followed him and asked for his name and corporate number then security was called wow filing complaint with corporate the wait staff who witness encounter all apologised for there manager and said please complain to corporate about him
Todd E.,"Bay City, MI",3,3,,1.0,1/2/2016,"Worst dining experience. Drive 1.5 hrs then wait 3.5 hrs (was told 2.5) only to be told when ordering that the signature dish (chicken & biscuits) is out and not only that, there are 3 other dishes that are out of also. This since 4 that day (they opened at noon). This is the only dish my wife likes to get, so after complaining to our waiter, he went off to "" talk to the manager"". Manager basically said ""to bad so sad"". The manager not once came to the table to explain the situation or show any customer service skills whatsoever. This will be our last visit to this Cheesecake location. This had been our third visit since they opened and it hasn't improved one bit. Still slow with less than stellar food."
Scott O.,"Novi, MI",0,61,13,5.0,2/15/2015,Yes they are busy and you're going to wait at prime time. But it's worth it. This is a wonderful addition to the mall. Service and food quality have been consistently good when we've visited this location.
Jenny J.,"Lincoln Park, MI",5,8,7,3.0,2/29/2016,This is the second time I've been to The Cheesecake Factory. The first was for lunch on a Saturday and a better time then the second. My second time was for dinner and waited 1 1/2 to receive a pager and another 1 1/2 for the pager to go off. We were finally seated (3 of us) at a half booth with a table. I'm not fond of this seating with no privacy to have a conversation. Service was ok. Ambiance was amazing... The food was not a 3 hour wait food. I will try again when the Cheesecake Factory hype calms down and can be seated in a more fashionably time.
Gyona C.,"Farmington Hills, MI",29,2,,1.0,12/31/2015,"After waiting over an hour and a half to be seated, I finally was able to place my order.  I ordered the herb crusted salmon, something I always order when I go there.  After waiting 30 minutes for my food it was served to me raw.  The waitress was nice and apologized and agreed that ""that was pretty bad"".  I received my new order in about 30 minutes.  I swear had I not put my name on the list first and then went shopping, I definitely wouldn't have waited so long to be seated.  Also, had I not used I gift card I probably would've walked out the first time they served me raw salmon.  In conclusion, the 3 hour wait wasn't worth this awful dining experience.  This used to be a pretty decent place to eat but the long wait times complimented with inedible food isn't worth it."
Michael S.,"Canton, MI",3,89,,2.0,9/2/2014,"Be prepared for a soaking One thing the Cheesecake Factory knows how to do is seperate you from your wallet. The average entree starts at 15 dollars and goes up A slice of cheesecake goes from 7 to 9 dollars I went there on a sunday afternoon and it was packed The girl at the front desk said it would be 30 minutes to get a buzzer, and a 60 to 90 minutee wait for a table. Unless the dishes are platnium plated and the food is top notch nothing is worth a 2 hour wait just to ""Be Seen"" at the CheeseCake Factory. I bolted for another restaurant."
Kristina N.,"Berkley, MI",0,13,4,4.0,9/17/2016,The wait for this place is always super long. Understandable though because it's the only one around here and the food is super yummy. The veggie burger is really flavorful and vegan! Make sure you have a lot of fabric napkins on hand cause the patty falls apart and gets messy. The fries were just meh. Definitely recommend this place!
