Kinda P.,"Muskegon, MI",0,16,,3.0,3/18/2016,"I've heard from other people and have read the reviews regarding the wait and so when my boyfriend and I decided to go on a Saturday, I informed him that the wait for a table would be ridiculously long.  I've gone to other Cheesecake Factories and the wait was bearable, but the wait time at the Novi location was bananas.  Luckily I packed my patience. We arrived after 5 but before 6 and there was a line out the door - I had to ask people in the line, which line was which - there were two lines out the of door, one to make a reservation and the other was the line to order a cheesecake.  Once we finally got up to the desk the young lady said 1 1/2 to 2 hour wait - luckily your at a mall.  So I came back a little earlier for my buzzer instead of the 45 minutes she told me - then proceeded to go back out in the mall for another 45 to 50 minutes.  Needless to say, it was not a 2 hour wait, more like a 2 1/2 or more!  There were people who did not pack their patience and were irate, but surprisingly did not leave to go elsewhere - I'm sorry if I'm that mad, I'm going someplace else.  When we were finally seated, the waitress came over immediately and asked if we were ready to order! Hold on - if I'm going to wait over 2 hours to eat, you will not rush me, so we took our time.  I had the Chicken Madeira and my boyfriend had the Steak and Shrimp Diane.  They were good.  The cheesecake was the obvious winner - I had the lemon meringue and he had the salted caramel - so good.  My suggestion for going here is to be patient, if you are not willing to wait over 2 hours on a weekend, then go somewhere else."
Kitty L.,"Whitmore Lake, MI",0,9,,2.0,9/14/2015,"We had been to cheesecake factories in Chicago and Utah- had good experiences there. It was Sunday at 3 and decided to see if we could get a table with a reasonable wait time otherwise we would of sat at the bar. Hostess told us 15 minutes so we agreed to wait. 30-40 minutes later we were sat at a booth table that was poorly wiped off, and the check from previous customers still there. waitress came over as I am wiping off the the table with my napkin. She did bring over a rag and wiped it off for us. The food and service was fine. Just disorganized and hectic in there. I won't be rushing back by any means."
Yvette R.,"Detroit, MI",1,20,,3.0,9/15/2014,"An update to my 8/25/13 post.  We went there to celebrate my mother's 73rd birthday. I understand they do not take reservation over the phone, so I went there to reserve a spot for over 20 people.  I was told it was a 2 - 2 and1/2 hour wait. This was at 1:45 p.m.  I notified my family and told them to arrive around 4:30 p.m.  We did not get seated until 6:00 p.m. because there was another large party there that had been there for over 2 hours and did not leave until an hour after cashing out their bill.  They should have some kind of rule in place for large groups that after dinner is finished you should not linger around for another hour or so.  Once our family was seated, we conversed, ordered and ate dinner and left after we finished.  We didn't want to be rude in case some other people were waiting.  2 hours is long enough to eat and converse. 3 and1/2 hours is ridiculous!!!! Anyway, the food was delicious and the wait staff was excellent."
Brandice L.,"Grand Rapids, MI",87,19,16,4.0,3/27/2015,"I love cheesecake.  Like really love cheesecake.  I can't be in a  city with a Cheesecake Factory and not stop.  I'm really bummed that GR doesn't have one and actually I'm really surprised.  We have to go to Detroit or Chicago.  What the heck.  Anyway, the wait was over 2 hours long which was just ridiculous, so we put our name on the list, got a beeper, ate elsewhere and just enjoyed cheesecake and a glass of wine when our time finally came.  The pineapple upside down cheesecake was amaze.  I would highly recommend.  We also had a chocolate peanut butter one (can't remember the exact name) but it was far too rich.  The pineapple upside down slice was just right."
Cory O.,"Novi, MI",14,1,,3.0,7/28/2016,Good food? Yes.  Worth the wait? Nope.     Even just ordering 2 slices cheese cake from counter took 25 minutes.  Maybe I value my time more than others.
Tom K.,"Livonia, MI",8,54,,3.0,1/5/2016,"Party of six for a birthday dinner.  Ten minute wait at 4.45 on a Tuesday.  Came in during a shift change but servers handled it well.  I ordered a bq burger and expressed that it be cooked ""medium"". I stressed that my last burger Was well done when requested medium .  The burger came well done again.  Our waitress Victoria,was very nice and offered another burger done to my likeness, but I didn't want to wait another 15-20 minutes while everyone else was eating.   Victoria did speak to the manager who graciously offered me a free cheese cake dessert to make up for the mistake.  This was appreciated and the rest of the dinner was fine and all enjoyed their food.  I just don't understand why a cook can't follow a simple request. Other than this it would have rated  four stars."
Graziano M.,"Royal Oak, MI",0,9,4,4.0,2/16/2016,"Came here on a Tuesday night and we got seated pretty quickly. Server was friendly and knowledgable which was great! Ordered the cheese bread as an appetizer and it was amazing. Table enjoyed their food as did I. I ordered a pepperoni pizza and it was cooked so nice and tasted amazing I loved it! Only downside is why I have rated it a 4/5 stars, was that my drink wasn't re-filled after the first one and she knew it was empty but still did nothing. so when the check came I asked for a to-go cup, as I was deprived during service. Kinda brought the vibe down. She was still great, but advice to pass on is: making sure the customer is being taken care of and not valued as a tip (income) object."
Valerie A.,"West Bloomfield Township, MI",34,134,141,5.0,11/15/2014,I really love this restaurant and the food and wide selection. Very large portions enough to split with someone! Only complaint is the restaurant is too cold.
Janelle G.,"Grand Rapids, MI",3,18,,3.0,5/15/2014,"It makes me sad to give a restaurant 3 stars, but in this case I think the rating is generous.  I have been to this restaurant 3 times. The first time everything was good. We knew we would have to wait, and that was fine. Once we were seated all was well except the cocktails were slow coming out. I got wasabi tuna, and my boyfriend got the Jamaican shrimp--he made the better choice. I can't remember which cheesecakes we got but they were good too.  The second time we went, a Tuesday night, the restaurant was still full but our wait was only about 20 minutes. We ordered an appetizer, which seemed to be taking awhile to come out. Then all of a sudden our meals were brought out! We decided to cancel the appetizer. I can't remember what my boyfriend ordered, but I got the combo chicken madeira and steak diane. I took a bite of my chicken and the sauce was really good, but the texture was not right. I looked, and the chicken was raw. I showed my boyfriend to get confirmation and he said yep--that's raw. I showed my server when she returned and she apologized. The manager came over and offered a complimentary salad while we waited. He also gave us 2 free slices of cheesecake. I wasn't angry--I understood and thought it was handled well. I was lucky to not get sick.  I brought my mom on the Saturday before mother's day. I had enjoyed the steak diane, so I ordered the combo with that and the salmon. I asked for medium rare-medium steak. I could not find a speck of pink in the meat. It was very well done. We had already waited a couple hours and I did not want to wait for my meal (again). So I just ate the salmon (which was great) and choked down the dry meat.  The kitchen is having some serious organizational issues. Perhaps investing in a reliable meat thermometer would be useful?  I like the cheesecake, but I'm inclined to just get a piece to go after dining somewhere else in the area."
Adrienne W.,"Southfield, MI",0,5,,2.0,5/24/2014,"Service is deplorable,  the cutlery is always dirty and the glasses are consistently,  shamelessly murky. In addition, the servers are UNTRAINED and act as if they are working at a theme park...this location HAD to be a rush job.  I have been to Cheesecake Factory locations all over the US and it was hands-down my favorite restaurant before going to the Novi location. I live 2 mins away from this restaurant and would rather drive 5 hours to Chicago then patronize this establishment. I was so excited that i was going to have a Cheesecake Factory in my backyard...epic fail!"
Kayla S.,"Novi, MI",5,7,,2.0,6/14/2014,"Appetizer came out 5 minutes before the meal and was cold. By the time it came out again I had sent part of my meal back for being cold, got the fresh food, and finished my meal. Again the appetizer was cold. It comes with a special sauce and after bringing it out four times and being assured four times it was the right sauce it still wasn't. The manager than attempted to prove me wrong.  The waitress was great but I can't say the same for the management."
Sherill M.,"Dallas, TX",3,308,32,2.0,6/6/2015,"I lived in Chicago for a while so I know this chain well, and this location is subpar. The staff is constantly overwhelmed and cannot handle crowds. After a 90 minute wait we were told there was another 20 minute wait on bread and cheesecake. This is ridiculous, bread isn't a special request cheesecakes are prepared, all you have to do is slice them..... The tortillas tasted microwaved, no freshness, the cheese was congealed and chicken dry. The pasta in the cajun dish was chewy and gross. The crab cake appetizer left a lot to be desired. It wasn't lump crab but the cheap fried version. $67 for 2 mediocre meals, I'm off this place....."
Ankur S.,"Farmington Hills, MI",31,5,1,5.0,12/4/2015,"After long shopping hours. We were really hungry and tired. Got to rest during 20-30 mins of waiting time. The service was excellent, menu was big, food was hot and meal sizes were big. We digged in and enjoyed our tasty dinner. Also, brought amazing red velvet cheesecake at home. Will be going back again!!!"
Pamela S.,"Southfield, MI",6,3,,1.0,5/10/2016,We visited the Cheese Cake factory 5/5/2016. We were celebrating my daughters 29 birthday. When we first arrived i went up to the reservation desk and the hostess asked me how many in my party. I advised that there were 6 adults and 2 children. She told me to hold on and that she would have to get the manager for approval. I guess they cannot seat more than 6 within managers approval. We waited and waited. Approximately 15 minutes before the manager showed up. We were then told that it would be 45 minutes and was given one of the buzzer things. After 45 minutes I went back to the hostess to find out how much longer. She said that there was a party at our table that had been there for 2.5 hours already and they were expecting them to leave any minute. Well 15 minutes later they were still sitting there. She then proceeded to offer us a table for 6 and another table for two kiddy corner from the table for 6.   I said absolutely not. We were celebrating a birthday and wanted to seat together. Finally after another 20 minutes the people started acting like they were going to leave. We finally got our table and was able to order our meal. The manager did come to the table and gave us 2 appetizers for free. But the issue that I have is that they don't have the capability to seat a large party. What restaurant has to get permission to seat more than 6 people. Come on Cheese Cake Factory you are supposed to be a restaurant. This situation was handled very poorly. I will never return. If it wasn't the birthday girls selection I would have left and went across t the other side of the expressway to one of  the other restaurants located there.
Ren S.,"Warren, MI",0,7,,1.0,5/11/2015,"The food and service was good, BUT the sanitary aspect of this restaurant was enough to make me consider walking out before our food was delivered.  We sat down and I noticed that the silverware was just sitting on the bare table. Not on a napkin, not on a plate or any other barrier between it or the table. It immediately freaked me out, but my sisters tried to reason with me and suggested that maybe they spray the tables down with bleach and that was sufficient for me if it was the case. While we were waiting to order the waitress brought our drinks and proceeded to set UNWRAPPED STRAWS ON THE TABLE. Again, I thought okay, they must clean these tables well. I mean, how could they get away with putting these items on the bare table after people have rubbed their hands and arms all over the table, perhaps maybe sneezed or spat during dinner -  they MUST use a bleach spray. While we continued to wait to order we watched the bus boy ""clean"" off the table next to us. The procedure was as follows: He took the dry looking towel out of the back of his sweaty apron, brushed the crumbs on to the floor, wiped off the booths and chairs (where peoples butts belong) wiped the table again and then set it. SO, your silverware and straws are sitting on a table that was not sprayed with a cleaning solution, wiped with a towel from the bus boys back, dragged across the germs from someones tush and then smeared back on the table. Yum! When my food was delivered I asked for new silverware and I will never go back. The End."
Megan K.,"Bay City, MI",82,523,785,5.0,10/4/2014,"Came here at almost 10 pm. No wait. Amazing waitress! She kept our drinks filled and made sure we had what we needed. We enjoyed fresh, warm bread and I had Chicken Carbonara. Perfect. By the time I finished dinner, I sadly had no room for cheesecake. Nice atmosphere. Prices a bit high but it was worth it for a nice dinner. The chicken pretzel bites were delicious too. I've been here one other time with friends from Canada and had the perfect meal then too."
Maggie M.,"Northville, MI",7,1,,3.0,5/20/2016,"My husband and I placed a to go order at 1:45 yesterday.   At 2:20 I was still waiting for it and the place was NOT busy!!!  The staff TOTALLY ignored myself and several others in line.   It was like we were invisible!!!!   One couple asked for a Manager and no one ever came!!! The sizes of cheesecake have definitely shrank while the price has gone up, up, up!!!   Their motto is ""How may I NOT help you today?""   Stay away, unless you feel like getting real, real aggravated!!!!"
Wendy A.,"Coldwater, MI",0,4,,1.0,5/1/2016,"Worst cheesecake factory eat at.   I ordered the blackened shrimp. The dish was good, but shrimp way overcooked.  My daughter can't come to Cheesecake Factory without ordering the bang bang chicken and shrimp.  She ordered it without the peas. It came with the peas.  Sent it back, 20 minutes later she received her meal. Sauce was watered down.  We will continue to visit other locations, but never again the Novi, MI.  We've eaten in Chicago. West Palm Beach and Ft. Lauderdale.  Never had not one complaint."
Jasmine N.,"Indianapolis, IN",209,70,28,1.0,3/31/2014,"I'm a big fan of The Cheesecake Factory. And I will continue to be. But this location does not meet up to the rest. The service is slow and the managers are completely unaware of the chaos that unfolds. I work in the service industry and understand that variables that affect operations. However, this place is bar far one of the worst. Any item off the menus takes 20-25 minutes. I ordered a steak salad medium it too 30 minutes. When it came out the steak was well done and the steak ice cold. It had been sitting for some time as the lettuce started to wilt. I tried to give them another try so I ordered a carry out order this past Sunday and they forgot half my order. Beyond unacceptable!"
Mary Ellen S.,"West Bloomfield Township, MI",9,43,,2.0,12/8/2015,"I visited this place several months ago, but just now got around to writing a review. Because it was so busy, my friend and I opted to eat at the bar (which was fine...we're big martini drinkers). I ordered the salmon, and my friend ordered a steak. My salmon was lack-luster, and actually gave me a stomach ache. My friend said the steak was dry and flavorless, and that her martini was too watered down. I enjoyed my martini, and the bartender/server we had was great, hence the 2 star review. Without that, I would most definitely leave a 1 star."
