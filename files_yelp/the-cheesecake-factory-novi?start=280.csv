Rachel K.,"Phoenix, AZ",165,29,8,5.0,3/19/2014,"Wow! So many negative reviews -- people are hard to please, eh? Firstly, yes, the wait is going to be astronomical if you're coming on a Saturday with a party or six or more; that's just common sense.  Secondly, come a decent time! Both times that I came here, I was seated immediately and the food came out quick and was fresh and tasty. This place has a fun atmosphere with tasty dishes and even tastier desserts, especially the cheesecake.  I enjoy this place every time I come, regardless of which city I'm in.  Yum! :)"
Amanda M.,"Wixom, MI",0,5,,4.0,1/14/2016,"The long waits and no reservations are the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. This place is amazing. Great food, beautiful atmosphere and the service is fantastic."
Jessica W.,"Redford, MI",1,16,1,5.0,6/8/2014,"Having gone to this restaurant while vising Chicago, my friends and I were excited to hear that they were finally building one in Michigan. However, we knew that the lines would be outrageous during the first few months of opening, so we didn't go until about a month ago. We came here on a Wednesday, at 4pm, and literally waited 2 minutes to be seated. For an appetizer, we tried their Avocado Eggsrolls. The eggrolls are scrumptious and the Tamarind-Cashew dipping sauce was amazing. I hope there's a store that carries it!  For my main entree I had the ""SkinnyLicious Turkey & Avocado Sandwich"". I was very satisfied. It wasn't greasy, it wasn't dry, it was well put together, and it wasn't too big. I can't recall what my friends ordered, but they were satisfied with their meals as well.  I also had a strawberry lemonade... made of actual lemonade and strawberry juice. It wasn't some flavored minute-maid crap, so that made me happy. No complaints about dessert either. As for service, whenever a waitress (not just ours) passed by, they would check on us. One of them was also pretty funny, so that's a plus. I'm glad we finally dined here, we will certainly be returning."
Plymouth J.,"Plymouth, MI",45,13,1,3.0,4/25/2014,"Ridiculously cold in this restaurant on a cold, rainy April day.  Management response: it takes an hour and a half for it to warm up - unacceptable. Eating in zipped-up coats. Service: Fine. Attentive, helpful waiter Michael.  Wait for food: Long, considering this is not fine cuisine.  Medium busy visit time at 2:00. Food quality:  B+. Excellent burger - well cooked, excellent flavor & bun. Beef sandwich very good. Orange chicken very good.  Low cal chopped salad - meh. A lot of greens, perhaps too much head lettuce. Tough to find the chicken in it.  Value:  B Overall: Its a chain. The experience suffered due how uncomfortably cold it was in here - and not any better by meals end. Despite multiple complaints by us and others, no manager checked on food or anything. Merely walking the floor to see table churn. Disappointing. Overall: Come on a hot day. Wait a while. Good service, decent food. Poor management attention to satisfaction."
Meghan T.,"Orion Township, MI",57,13,,2.0,1/5/2016,"Got here at 7, left at 10.... pretty horrible ampunt of time to spend at a restaurant considering it was a Tuesday. Food was decent, not something I would wait for again though, and definitely not worth the price. Menu was nice and large though, so that's nice if you're picky about food like me. As for dessert, I didnt get any as I wasnt going to wait any longer than I had to."
Suresh M.,"Farmington Hills, MI",0,11,2,1.0,1/2/2016,Very unprofessional and rude manager and staff at reception. Giving One star rating would be a huge favor when I look at staff's behavior.  But waitress and food are good.
N T.,"Canton, MI",0,6,1,1.0,4/15/2016,"VERY DISAPPOINTED!  I'm always a Cheesecake Factory fan.  It was my first time going to the one in Michigan.  I ordered a curbside pickup, no one show up with my food at the curbside. I waited for about 10mins, so I had to go inside. Not to mention, I had to line up again.  Then I had to wait again at the pickup counter for another 10-15mins .  I asked for extra bread.  I opened the bag & saw a 1/2 loaf of bread for 3 main entrees. I supposed they'd only give me 1/4 loaf of bread if I didn't ask for extra.  I had to ask again to get another 1/4 loaf of bread.  No apologies for the wait.  I was very upset & disappointed with this Cheesecake Factory."
Ted H.,"Commerce Township, MI",0,9,,3.0,7/5/2016,Ordered the lite menu. But more than $10 for a sangria and $3 for ice tea is way over priced.
Peter N.,"Chino, CA",133,39,68,5.0,4/12/2014,"Cali transplant and newly Michigander here, wanted to say that I'm glad Michigan finally has another restaurant to remind me of home. For some reason, everytime I go here, there's a Black Friday line. It's calm down a lot since it's opening premiere, but still, expect 60-90 min before you eat. Plan your appetite accordingly, otherwise you're gonna be a grumpy eater. If you're a true regular, you'll know the secret of waiting at the bar for a table. The bar seating tables aren't that bad. Food is the same and service is quicker.  I don't know whether the menu is different from Cali or if it's changed in general but some of my favorite dishes are missing. Atmosphere is consistent with all other chains. Great restaurant for celebrations, anniversaries, or just to have a good time.  The restaurant is not as big as other cheesecake factories I've seen. Otherwise, I highly recommend! As far as foods, can't go wrong with any of the entrees, but do yourself a favor and treat your hardworking stomach to a strawberry cheesecake!"
Margaret S.,"Detroit, MI",3,40,6,4.0,5/23/2016,We had  pots tickers good but too much  Binger in sauce  I had chicken salad very good Husband had Cuban  sandwich also very good service will be back had no room  for desert
Matthew K.,"South Lyon, MI",25,306,26,1.0,2/8/2014,"What the hell is wrong with this place?!  Horribly designed (who puts the takeout right next to the entrance ""lobby""?, or the takeout line completely blocking the waiters' ability to get to the counter?), slow servers, expensive cheesecake...it's just bad.  But the most unacceptable part is that they don't offer reservations and there is somehow a 3-3.5 hour wait for dinner?!  I'd say this restaurant will learn its lesson, but it looks like people are stupid enough to wait that long, and camp out in the mall lobby like stranded passengers at the airport after a canceled flight. This place is absurd, and no one should support such a horribly created restaurant. That being said, it's the perfect restaurant for the typical Novi-ian, and as far as I'm concerned, they deserve to wait in line while other much better restaurants can have my business :) Oh, and another thing, if you compromise and go here on a weekday instead of the weekend, you're rewarded with stale 3-4 day old cheesecake that's hard to put a fork through.  Can't imagine what kind of food leftovers you're getting then, either."
K D.,"Flint, MI",38,72,244,4.0,6/6/2014,"I don't get all the bad reviews for this place. I think sometimes it's just hard to please some people, because I had great service on a Friday at 3:30 pm, before the big dinner rush arrived. I had a party of 2 and was seated right away. Food arrive in a timely matter and was awesome. I've been to other Cheesecake restaurants in other states and none of them have ever disappointed me yet."
Eric C.,"Rochester, MI",1,56,47,3.0,9/6/2015,This was our first trip to this Cheesecake Factory.  The food was very good and the waitress was top notch.  My only complaint is that it was a mad house and we had to wait for 2 hours to get a table.  I recommend you make a reservation in advance or don't go during the weekend.
Anissa D.,"Detroit, MI",0,1,2,5.0,12/6/2015,I went there for the first time last month and it was amazing. Friendly staff. It does get busy fast but the cheesecake is worth it.
Heidi B.,"Port Huron, MI",2,2,,1.0,5/2/2015,HORRIBLE. We were seated after an hour wait.  The dishes in the table were dirty. We sent them back and gave us more dirty dishes. The drink glasses were caked with food. The straw that broke the camels back was when we discovered pieces of bacon inside a tea pot for hot tea. Manager said he was sorry and that he eats here everyday and not to worry. Yuck... Do not go here.
Nick A.,"Burton, MI",6,4,2,5.0,9/17/2014,This is on the north side of the mall next to Nordstrom.  It has a patio and external entrance.
Chrysalis N.,"West Branch, MI",1,4,,2.0,6/30/2015,"The wait wasn't bad for us, about 20 minutes. The waitress was NOT good. The couple next to us was seated after us, but the waitress waited on them first, didn't refill drinks, we had to ask for a dessert menu....just bad. I got a salad and a sandwich off the lighter menu. My salad was lettuce ONLY, with the dressing. Nothing else!! My sandwich tasted really good, but was very small. My husband ordered a shrimp and chicken combo, with potatoes. His piece of chicken was so thin, and small, there was a strip of potatoes down the center of the plate, and then 3 small shrimp in some kind of sauce. Neither one of us could believe it when the waitress came out with the plates.  We wouldn't have minded the small portions, after all, I did order off the light menu, but the price was WAY too much. Insanely high price for what we were served. Was hoping to enjoy an amazing piece of cheesecake afterwards...It is called the Cheesecake Factory after all, but that wasn't even as good as I thought it would be.  To summarize....we will not go back!  It was WAY overpriced!!!  I'm not quite sure why so many people wait so long to get in to this place???"
Beth J.,"Haslett, MI",43,92,4,3.0,8/27/2014,"Get ready to spend big bucks here. I had previously been to The Cheesecake Factory in the Dayton, OH area which was great. This new one in Michigan (the only one I think) is just as good. But it is very expensive in my opinion.  We had lunch here. We did not order alcoholic drinks or an appetizer, though I had a lemonade. We ordered two entrees. We also ordered two slices of cheesecake to go. The bill came to about $50, $60 with a 20% tip. I find that very, very expensive for a lunch for two, even in suburban Detroit. Service was good. We did wait, about 20-25 minutes and that was at 2:00 in the afternoon. I'm not sure why people are a little crazy over this place. It's good, but really, you can get the same thing elsewhere and without the wait.  I'll just pick up cheesecake to go next time."
Linda M.,"Farmington, MI",4,33,6,3.0,5/5/2016,"Since they have opened in Novi, I have been here a total of 5 times. Unfortunately, each time has gone slightly down hill from the last visit. We came here for our wedding anniversary (we had a gift card), and the wait at almost 9pm was about an hour and 15 mins. I figured it would be less considering its later in the evening. We had a nice waitress, and she was very prompt even when I noticed that our utensils were dirty... she got us a new set right away. I ordered what I ordered before, which was the garlic noodles with shrimp, shitake mushrooms, and tomatoes. When I received my order, my shrimp was slightly overcooked and the mushrooms were just regular white mushrooms - not shitake (this actually DOES make a difference in taste). I also noticed the floors there are ALWAYS slippery. I have no clue why its like that in there, but it can be a hazard if you have shoes that don't have enough traction on it (like heels). Overall, the wait is still ridiculous, food is mediocre, cheesecakes are pretty good, and the service is hit or miss."
Rob O.,"Waterford Township, MI",9,9,17,4.0,7/13/2014,"My wife won a gift card for the Cheesecake factory in a raffle and so today we cashed it in.  We were seated about 20 minutes after we arrived for lunch, and were served by the amazingly fun, cordial and otherwise brilliant ""Paws"" (that was the name she said she's known by). Our orders were taken promptly and were served in a very appropriate amount of time while my wife and I chatted.  To be fair it is a very busy restaurant with many dining parties; it is not where you go for a quiet intimate conversation.  All three of our courses (appetizer, main, and dessert) were amazingly presented and perfect taste. Paws was fun, she had the right sense of humor for us, was timely in her check-ins, and even dealt amazingly well with my request for my burger to be split to help me resist the temptation of eating the whole thing and not saving room for cheesecake.  And it's a good thing that she brought my take home box early because it was so amazing I forgot all about the cheesecake and would have eaten it all of my Macaroni and cheese burger (yes mac n cheese on a burger!) in one sitting.  The cheese cake, of course, was out of the world.   Now to be fair, it was not quiet (I mentioned) and many reviews have lamented the long waits.  We went for lunch and we arrived at around 11:30.  When we left there was quite a wait forming, many with small children in the hallway of the mall.  This place is a very popular establishment and you should expect a wait.  Plan to stand about and visit with your party rather than be immediately seated.  It was also loud as it is pretty much one big room so don't plan for a lot if whispered low key conversation.  And, well, it's pricey.  Our meal with appetizer, two entrees and two desserts (one came home immediately), was around $60 before tip. For the experience it was totally worth it and we will be making plans to return.  We will not, though, be bringing our children (I saw a lot of families) as while there will be something they will eat, they won't appreciate the presentation, or the quality of the food yet."
