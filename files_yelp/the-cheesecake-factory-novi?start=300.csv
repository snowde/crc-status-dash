Pradeep K.,"Southfield, MI",0,2,,2.0,7/9/2016,"HORRIBLE! I always looked forward to eat here but from now I would never suggest anyone to come here. The asparagus was cold, my mashed potatoes were undercooked (not mashed). To top it all my pasta tasted like just cheese and chilli. Along with a poor service they also overcharged me. They did not get my garlic bread at first. But to cover up they did offer me the garlic bread for free. To be honest I would never come here again anytime soon until I miss their cheesecake."
Kevin S.,"Cathedral City, CA",397,372,136,5.0,8/8/2015,Casey P. Was amazing.  Crispy Chicken Costoletta was best chicken I've had in years and Salted Caramel Cheesecake was out of this world. 2 hour wait was crazy but after this dinner it was worth it. Oh you don't leave hungry.
Liz W.,"Belleville, MI",1533,1111,145,4.0,12/8/2013,"I know it is overhyped. I know it is overpriced. I also know you are foolish to wait for it. I still have a soft spot for The Cheesecake Factory.  I went awhile back in the sweet spot of dining out time wise. It was like a Tuesday or Wednesday afternoon around 3pm. There was little to no wait. Wait staff did a good job. Sat in a half booth and was comfy too.  The food was really quite delish. My dad had the steak Diane and shrimp scampi combo, my mom had the Jamaican black pepper shrimp and I went with the herb crusted salmon. All were happy and huge, none were dietician friendly. I think very few things on the menu are to be frank. This doesn't bother me a bit, if you are trying to eat anywhere near healthy it may bother you. Me, well I figure they state they are a cheesecake place so I am not expecting health food. I love the sinful nature of the salmon here, the lemon sauce is creamy and evil, a pure butter base. This rich sauce is perfect with the slightly crisped salmon, calorie bomb mashed potatoes and tender crisp asparagus. I also loved my mom's shrimp because of the black beans, mango salsa and fried plantains. They all worked together well with the kick of the shrimp. My dad's scampi was tasty but I am not hugely into steak Diane. It is a good rendition if you like it though. I will get a salad next time because the portions were so generous I couldn't order a dessert. I took a bite of my mom's carrot cake and meh. Skip it. I'm betting the carrot cheesecake is better. I find the cakes in here to be a bit overrated myself but the cheesecakes are always fabu. My bite of my father's key lime cheesecake was bliss. I like it here a lot but will not be a regular until the hype dies a bit."
C C.,"Novi, MI",1,47,32,1.0,3/20/2016,"Wow what a mess!!!  If you are in the mood for a long wait, over priced food, and poor service look no further...I have found The Cheesecake Factory. It was a night to remember, food came out to different people at different times. I'm not talking about 1-2 minutes apart I am talking about 10 minutes difference. My steak was over cooked on both attempts and by the time they came back to check on me the rest of my party was done eating.  If the kitchen does not know how to cook steak don't put it on your menu!! Is your menu too big to do anything on it correctly?"
Matthew D.,"Midland, MI",14,15,5,1.0,1/27/2014,My wife and I love the The cheese. My wife worked at one for two yrs. so we know the menu well and were very happy Michigan finally got one. We use to drive to Chicago just to eat there.  We arrived at 3 on a Saturday and they were quoting a 2:30 wait.  A hour just to get a pager. Our excitement ended quickly and we left. But we noticed that it was the smallest cheese that we ever seen. They either need to add three or four more in Metro or build a stand allow that can handle the demand. The rating is just for how long the wait time was and how small the store is. It has nothing to do with food or service.
Amber V.,"Grosse Pointe, MI",92,17,16,5.0,8/22/2014,I am a person who likes my burgers very well done. Only 2 times in my life have I had a well done burger that was also extremely juicy. The Smokehouse BBQ Burger from this place was one of those times! Absolutely AMAZING!
Terry G.,"Harrison Township, MI",14,28,19,4.0,4/7/2014,"2 hour wait so far. They were right on with the 2 hour wait. We had a bunch of different appetizers with 5 people. The avocado spring rolls are a must try. We also had the lettuce wraps and the taco wraps. Everything was great from the food to the service. I would have given it 5 stars if it were not for the wait. And last for not least we had 3 different cheesecakes and the best was the cookie dough, all 5 agreed."
Nandi S.,"Royal Oak, MI",110,62,139,5.0,7/20/2015,It was alot of people but we sat at the bar. The service was great and they were very friendly and helpful. I enjoyed myself and the food. The piece of cake we got after was lovely!!!
Mark Y.,"Trenton, MI",39,2,,4.0,2/14/2014,"First and foremost you need to understand what kind of restaurant the Cheesecake Factory is. It is not fine dining, seems like many negative reviews are from those expecting way too much. I see it has a glorified Applebee's or chilis I mean this in a good way. The price for the average meal is slightly higher but the quality of the product is considerably better, than many of the other chain restaurants. As for the service, we had no problems at all. We waited about 40 minutes to be seated. Our food did take a little long but the manager came to our table and addressed the issue and apologized and said our meal was being finished and will be out shortly, and it did.  Food was very good for the price. The place was very busy but our server still performed at a high level he was attentive with refills and clearing our table of finished plates.  Now on to the cheesecake, this is where everyone should have high expectations.  A huge selection almost hard to pick just one, everything sounds amazing.  We settled on two slices to take home.  Chocolate cookie dough and red velvet cheesecake.  They were everything we had hoped great flavor and well prepared not frozen.  Is it worth waiting 45 minutes to an hour absolutely, 3 hour wait? Well that might be a stretch. But overall we had a nice dining experience."
Some N.,"Wixom, MI",0,17,,3.0,6/4/2016,"It's okay, but I've been to Cheesecake Factories in other states and this one doesn't compare. First and foremost, if you go there, get the iced tea. Like any other Cheesecake Factory, you have a massive, somewhat overpriced menu to order from that has something for anyone. The actual food, however, has been a hit or miss with me the times I've gone to this particular location where I've always had a good go of any other location. Expect a fair wait if you're going during prime hours friday-sunday. You might be able to shave off an hour of waiting if you jump on an open bar table, which are first come first serve, or the bar itself which is full service. The food, to get back to it, has been lacking, especially for the price, and for the life of me they aren't getting the cheesecake right. The cheesecake in question, the cookie dough one with the oreo crust, the oreo is just mushy and gross where the other locations have their oreo game on point. For your money, I'd recommend you walk 10 feet over to California Pizza Kitchen."
Vik A.,"Bloomfield Hills, MI",17,36,,5.0,3/20/2015,"I am not a big fan of the the cheesecakes but I love the spicy chicken chipotle pasta there. Have visited the the chain in many other cities but the this was the first visit in the hometown. Service was great, bread was delicious and the cracks were awesome too."
Michelle N.,"San Jose, CA",283,583,90,5.0,11/3/2013,"In honor of birthmonth (yay!), the bf took me here for a late-night date...night, haha. We arrived ~10PM and were told of a 2 hour wait.  We took a pager and in the mean time scoped out some bar seating, which opened up within 5 mins of us looking!  Score!!  We had a great time with our bartender, Jared, and really enjoyed the food, watching the hockey game, and the nice buzz that the drinks gave us. ;) We ordered: - passion fruit mojito: probably my fave adult drink EVER at any restaurant I've been to..but I'm also really sentimental, and this was my first 21+ drink (aside from the shots everyone tried to poison my liver with the night I actually turned 21 -_-)..sooooo delicious. - strawberry daiquiri: could use a little more blending, but still delicious!!!  Lucky for me, the bf was driving, so I enjoyed most of both drinks. ;) - crab & artichoke dip: sooooo good!! I always order this, and while my complaint is that it's a little too mayo-y, that has more to do with corporation's recipe, not this particular location. It really is good though, so try it! - calamari: the bf's pick..nothing too special IMO, but he's a huge calamari fan and seemed to enjoy it - chicken di pana: I ALWAYS order this, too!!  It's my go-to: pan-fried, breaded chicken; mashed potatoes; broccoli.  The portions here are huge.  I was really worried that the portions would be small (as I had read in a previous yelp review), but I thought my chicken di pana portion size was the same as other CCF. - angel hair pasta w/shrimp: I do not recommend this.  The bf ordered it, and it honestly looked like a bowl of tomatoes and 4 shrimps. The shrimps were salty, the pasta was hidden waaaaaay under tomatoes, and ugh yuck, I just do not like tomatoes. - warm apple crisp: so the whole reason I even wanted to venture out to CCF was the mojito and the warm apple crisp.  For some reason, I was craving it, and it did not disappoint!!!  I just wish the ""crisp"" was crispier and not so mushy, and I need to remember to request no whipped cream next time. - strawberry cheesecake & snickers cheesecake to-go: I'm not a cheesecake fan, but the bf is pretty excited to eat his cheesecake for dinner tonight, haha! Tips/thoughts: - It's a brand new CCF, as well as the only one in Michigan, so of COURSE there's gonna be a horrendous wait.  Please don't yell at the hostess or give her attitude, it's not really her fault everybody wants to eat here. - Service from the bartender, JARED, was great!!! I highly recommend looking for bar seating if you don't want to wait.  He was personable, gave us his honest recs, boxed up our food for us (score! bf & I hate doing that, haha!), and was honestly on his toes all night..not sure how he does it, but I was exhausted just looking at him! - If you look for bar seating, please return your pager. I hella hate when people hog a bar table, then move their food/drinks over to a booth when it clears up. Don't be that jerk. Give the booth to someone else if you already have a bar spot. - I can't even believe this needs to be said, but please remember to tip!!!  And tip well.  The waitstaff is doing the best they can (at least IMO, from sitting at the bar and watching them run back and forth with drinks).  The dessert area really helps the bar area, and the workers all seem pretty friendly and willing to help each other.  I'm throwing this in here bc I think the people near us gave a 5% tip, which I'm still fuming about a whole day later hahaha. - The venue is small. Much smaller than other CCF that I'm used to frequenting. Overall, I'm a fan.  I'll be back to look for bar seating! :D"
Bill E.,"Novi, MI",2,10,,2.0,5/4/2014,"Found the food to be okay at best. The menu needs to be streamlined so a higher level of quality can be maintained. I suspect many of the items on the menu are microwaved rather than cooked to order. Even the cheesecake was disappointing. I know this is a very popular spot, but I just was not impressed. Have had the same experience at this restaurant in other cities. Had  hoped that this one would be better since it's new. I think I may be done with this restaurant."
Dan S.,"East Lansing, MI",0,30,,4.0,5/23/2015,"We arrived seating  for 2 Saturday at 4 pm  The wait was  about 15 minutes not long at all. Started off with complimentary bread that was good the butter was to cold to apply to the bread. As this is ""the cheesecake factory"" we started with cheese cake she the oreo and I the pinapple upside-down cheese cake. These took no time at all to recive. My cheesecake was pretty sweet tasted very sugary it was enjoyable even though I could not taste the cheesecake part all that much. We traded a small piece of cheesecake about 3 bites I had one bite of her oreo and found that it was excessively sugary so much so that I did not eat the rest of it. She agreed and her cheesecake went more then half uneaten. Out appetizer was put in soon after our cheese cake arrived we ordered the stuffed mushrooms that were average there were 6 small mushrooms that we shared. Between that and our main dish took about 15 min. I ordered the bacon bacon burger medium well with a side salad. The burger and salad were both very good and large. She ordered the chicken shrimp in curry sause witch was also very good from the one bite I had. She said that the rice served with her meal was just ok.     Service here seems decent they were friendly even during shift change they did not really skip a beat witch was great for how busy they were. The overall price for 2 cheesecake an appetizer and two entrees with waters was 57+tip pretty average price for a slightly higher then mid grade restaurant. The atmosphere was a bit loud but looked nice and seating for 2 was very small."
Tamara F.,"New York, NY",250,42,119,2.0,4/7/2014,"Great service, heavy, salty sweet food laiden with thick sauces. I couldn't understand how salmon and rice could be 1,100 calories. Well, I got exactly 5 snow peas.  That's the vegetable?  A garnish?  Thick yellow sauce soaking all the rice. I avoided it as much as possible."
Erin M.,"West Bloomfield Township, MI",71,4,,1.0,1/17/2015,"We expected to wait, however I did not expect to be treated poorly because I had an infant with me. I was told we'd have to wait again for a seat that could accommodate our party and a car seat. This should have been my sign to leave. The food was disappointing we had bang bang chicken and shrimp it was rubbery shrimp and dry chicken as well as the beef sandwich was over cooked and the bread was over toasted. Sadly since this is a tourist trap it will last. The only saving grace was the pleasant waitress"
Bernice M.,"Windsor, Canada",19,83,17,2.0,9/28/2013,"I have been to other Cheesecake Factory locations and loved them. Unfortunately, I cannot say the same about this location. To be fair, this is a new location, but many things need to be changed before I will go back. To begin, there was a two hour wait when we got there. It's understandable that everyone wants to try this restaurant, but I truly don't believe that the long wait is due to the quantity of customers. I think that the wait is due to the restaurant being understaffed. If the restaurant hired more staff, the turnaround would be quicker and the wait would not be as long. I eat out a lot, and this is the first time that I've sat in a restaurant for two and a half hours.   My friends and I came from Windsor, Ontario, Canada. They would not serve us with our canadian drivers licenses (we are all in our thirties). One of my friends left her passport in the car, and could not get served.  I guess if you have an enhanced license you can't get served at this restaurant. Our appetizers were great. No complaints there. They ran out of the macaroni balls that we really wanted to try, but the spinach dip was great.  One of my friends and I ordered the exact same lunch pasta meal. My pasta was slightly undercooked, but hers was like it wasn't even boiled. Not a good thing. She wasn't impressed. The waitress asked her what she would like done and she got a new order to go (at no charge). The dessert was excellent, as always.  Three different cheesecakes, and they were all wonderful. I love the carrot cake cheesecake: DELICIOUS. I can't give this restaurant more than 2 stars because I have been to other Cheesecake Factory locations and todays experience was very disappointing.  Hopefully with time, things will change. For now, I would recommend that you stay FAR FAR AWAY from this restaurant."
Lisa W.,"Livonia, MI",41,224,73,2.0,9/18/2013,"I was very excited about Cheesecake Factory arriving in the Detroit area.  I have been to Cheesecake Factories in Chicago, Boston, and San Francisco.  The Novi location was a huge disappointment! Weekday evening, my husband and I arrive about 4:45, no wait.  Settle in, order drinks, inquire about the ""no frills"" Margarita...$9.50.  Don't think so...maybe now I understand why the prices aren't listed.  Or, is the message here that 'if I need to ask, I can't afford it'?  C'mon, just list the prices.  You're a franchise in a mall.  I went with non-alcoholic fare.  The wait for the drinks was on the long side.   The menu said lunch portions available until 5:00.  The waitress came back with the drinks and  my husband inquired about the smaller/lunch portion.  ""No, that's only until 4:00""  ""Menu says 5:00""   Waitress says,""If you really want me to go check, I will but they don't like to see a ticket for lunch portions when dinner's underway""  Looking at my watch ""Forget it"", now  5:04 anyway,  we didn't want to make a big deal about the time.   Seriously though, you're guilting us with the cockeyed glance you're gonna get from the kitchen staff because it's a really cumbersome endeavor to scoop just a half portion of the Alfredo into the bowl?  Please.  After taking the opportunity to peruse the menu for another 5 minutes until she returned, my husband just ordered the full plate.   I ordered the Cashew Chicken.  The bread finally arrived after we ordere.  When my food arrived, my Cashew Chicken was sweeter than I ever remember in the past visits.  It was sadly, just ok.   My husband's Fettucini Alfredo was disappointedly bland.  He said he has had Ramen with more flavor (and I'm talkin' pre-packet).  Texture and portion were satisfactory but he was hunting for something to overcome the blandness.  He even reached for the salt just to keep his taste buds in the game.    Wish we could have had a better experience but, frankly, in my opinion:  Cheesecake Factory Novi  was very disappointing."
Nicole S.,"Taylor, MI",65,6,1,3.0,7/9/2015,If I could give  to my server lilly I would she made my experience at the restaurant wonderful . She stayed on top of your table and made sure my son was taken care of . The food was just ok I thought it would of been better tasting that's why I only gave 3 stars. Our second server Elise who had to take over our table was a disappointment she kept forgetting items she brought my sons dressing for his salad but then a half hour went by before she brought over his salad . She was not attentive to her tables and it took forever for her to return .
Jason S.,"Royal Oak, MI",9,88,3,1.0,10/20/2013,"The food is great, but the service is TERRIBLE! Expect to wait 1.5 hours minimum. That wouldn't be a problem except the wait staff told us we could eat anywhere in the bar area and after we found a table in what we were told was the designated bar area, we were asked to leave because a lone table that we were seated at in the bar area was technically not bar area seating. The waiter who asked us to leave was extremely rude.  Bottom line, the Cheesecake Factory has fantastic food, but my experience at the Twelve Oaks Mall location was miserable. NOT RECOMMENDED."
