Kelly S.,"Farmington, MI",151,176,22,3.0,11/24/2013,"We waited an hour & a half for a table on a Monday afternoon...that was disappointing.  Once we were seated the service was on the slow side but good.  The food was good, not as great as I would have hoped as I've only had desserts here in the past but figured their food must be good given their following.  I had the pulled pork sandwich which was like $12 & while it fed me 2 meals I don't think it was worth $12!  I also had their blackout cake since I don't like cheesecake & it was really yummy...I ate it 4 times before I finished it, it was a huge piece of cake! In the future I would only come here for drinks & dessert...seating in the bar is first come first serve so it would be much easier than having to wait for a table to eat a whole meal.  Plus I thought their tables were a little too close together...we had a big booth (there were 6 of us) but the tables were like 2 feet apart so if I were on a date I would feel like I was on that date with the people at the next table as well."
Ted C.,"Walled Lake, MI",121,32,,5.0,8/14/2013,"WOW MAN... amazing. Welcome to the D -- I am so glad this place is finally here. I want to give a stellar review before all the nerd foodies come and trash it. First up, they do not accept student dining hall passes here -- that being said this is for serious food fans. The prices are great, the quality is greater -- I got a big kick out of the presentation of each dish I ordered --- The calimari is really great here -- and there was enough to share. It was piled up really high and it was fresh and not frozen -- it came with two sauces - including cocktail sauce and lemon -- which is a big deal with me. I don't go for that dismal warm marina sauce that some restaurants throw at ya. Every category here is worth raving about including the salads --- it was well prepared and thought out. I grabbed a pizza here too which was incredible and just the right size. I got the ""everything"" pizza and it had wonderful pepperoni on it and it was light and not heavy. I couldn't resist not taking my servers suggestion and walked out of that place with a slice of  chocolate tuxedo cheesecake -- pure Heaven kids. The decor of this place is going to knock your socks off they did a stellar job of putting this place together. I really loved the customer service too -- everyone bent over backwards to please. I didn't feel rushed here even though the line was long. I only had to wait 40 minutes to get a table even though I was originally quoted 1.5 to 2 hours of waiting time. I didn't get into the bar scene here but they got a beaut. They have an amazing bar with lights and plenty of seating right by the outdoor patio. In addition to mojitos and margaritas they have a full wine list. There is a brunch menu option too when you come. They run the brunch on Sundays between 10 - 2PM and the items on that menu look colorful and fun. I will be back again and again.....  the bakery is tremendous and the selection is over the top. The place is also kid friendly."
Alyssa M.,"Detroit, MI",296,227,22,4.0,10/20/2013,"I can't believe I'm actually writing this review...because I never thought I'd see the day that Michigan actually opened a Cheesecake Factory! I've always been a fan of Cheesecake Factory's 20 pg menu, large portions, creative dishes, and decadent cheesecake. I've wanted to try this location with my family for some time now, but my parents have refused to go because every time we call we hear that there is a 3-4hr wait :-( Well finally my Dad finally broke down and surprised me and my Mom by taking us there when there was only a 2-3hr wait--what a great Dad!  A girl could always do a little shopping during the wait.  **Only a minus star for the ridiculous wait times---this location is just not big enough to accommodate the demand** I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the food for just opening.  I ordered my usual: Appetizer:  Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes--the whole family enjoyed this sweet corn cake topped with sour Cream, Salsa, Avocado and Salsa Verde. Meal:  Pasta Da Vinci--a chicken, mushroom, and onion pasta dish with a mediera wine sauce--awesome! Drink:  Strawberry lemonade with a sugar rim--always a favorite Dessert: I actually was too full to order cheesecake, I know--total sin!  However I tried my Dad's strawberry shortcake which was really good! I had such a great experience at this Cheesecake Factory and will definitely be back."
Jim E.,"Belleville, Canada",455,286,1086,5.0,8/25/2013,"Only an hour wait! We wanted to wait a few weeks after opening to come here due to insane wait times. I must say they have a great location here, I still don't agree with the Novi Choice (I thought they should go to Somerset in Troy or Partridge Creek in Clinton Township) but the restaurant is well done and looks great. I was impressed that once you got in the service was Fast, friendly, and efficient.  The quality was as good if not better then any  other location I went to ( I thought being so new it may have flaws) As usual the bread they serve ahead of time is great, I enjoy the Lemonade with the Sugar around the cup rim. I had the Burger with the deep fried Mac and Cheese on top, it made for a great combination and I really enjoyed the burger bun which had a rich yellow color and taste. I like how they serve the fries as well in a tin sort of cup, and they taste great.  My favorite cheesecake the Dulce De Leche again stole the show, this place serves hand down the best Cheesecake in the market.  The Cheesecake Factory makes a dining experience, delicious, memorable, and unique."
Shannon B.,"Plymouth Charter Township, MI",40,131,22,4.0,10/8/2013,"I'm a regular?! FML! YES, there is a long wait to get a seat on weekends and evenings. YES, it is worth it! Be prepared to have at least a 2 hour wait to be seated. Plan around that! Go to the mall, do some shopping...get drunk in the parking lot (if you are 21 or older), whatever!  People KNOW that you're going to have to wait if you see a line out the door and through the parking lot. Why throw a hissy fit when the hostess tells you it's going to be a 2-3 hour wait?! Use common sense, people!  The pasta dishes are great and of course, the cheesecakes as well. The Kahlua cheesecake is my FAV!  The reasons I did not give this place 5 stars is because the location is small and you can only order cheesecake for carry out."
Sara G.,"Ferndale, MI",314,187,26,3.0,8/27/2013,"If you've never in your life consumed a REAL NY-style cheesecake (I'm talking a cake at least a 4"" in height, BEFORE any toppings), you probably think TCF is the holy grail of cheesecake.  And, let's be honest here, outside of the 5 boroughs it probably is. Plus you get to choose your favorite flavor, like ice cream. As far as chain restaurants go, TCF is top notch--with tons of choices. My main gripe is that we had to wait in line to wait in line. At 2:30p on a Friday there were still swarms of peeps waiting to be sat and fed. After waiting to be handed a buzzer, we were told it would be about a 90-120 min wait. Despite the hostess' warning that the buzzer would be out of range, we still went around the corner to 'window shop' our wait out. We were only gone for 30 min and not 5 min after we staked out a spot outside the buzzer went a'buzzin'. Lucky timing! The patio outside is nice, and there are large metal heaters to make the evenings less chilly. The service was good and prompt. Lots of staff, all busting ass while simultaneously attempting to stay out of each other's way.  We ordered appetizers for lunch. I got the calamari, which was crunchy and juicy, with plenty of tentacles as well as rings (I dig tentacles. No jokes allowed!). My mom got the vegetable fries which, um, I'll probably get next time. Wedges of deep fried luxury--I mean mushrooms, zucchini and AVOCADOS. Deep fried avocados are some serious crack and I'm a fool for not discovering them sooner. Cheesecake time! My mom got plain w/strawberries and I got the tiramisu, both were quite good. I had a feeling they'd do mine well and they did. The espresso/liquor soaked ladyfingers served as the 'crust' and a thick layer of mascarpone blanketed the top of the actual cheesecake. I would have preferred it without the giant dollop of chocolate buttercream on top (the trying-too-hard part), but hey, if you're going to hell, go to hell non-stop, right?  I do not find it worth the wait. We lucked out, but if I'm going to wait close to 2 hours for a meal at a restaurant I'll do so for an establishment of Roast proportions, not a chain. Still, I can see myself coming back, if the wait isn't too monstrous and most especially if I'm in the mood to top off my meal with cheesecake!"
Layan A.,"Minneapolis, MN",92,246,374,3.0,5/2/2014,"Great standards as usual. Not too many cheese cake options. The wait is ridiculous all days of the week. The food is really rich, can be a tad heavy. I with they would take reservations I would be going more often"
Anthony D.,"Royal Oak, MI",118,73,4,2.0,8/23/2013,"I ended up going to Cheesecake Factory about a week after they opened.  Around 3pm on a Monday.  I figured at that time it would be as slow as it's going to be.  We tried to enter through the mall, and an employee shoo'd us away.  She said we couldn't enter that way and had to walk all the way around to the entrance facing the parking lot.  So we walked all the way around, and re-entered the establishment through the ""allowed"" entrance.  We approached the host stand where there was a large crowd of people waiting to be seated.  We were quoted a time of 2 hours and 30 minutes to seat our party of two.  Lucky for us, there was an open high top table near the bar, which is first come first serve.  We ended up getting a table in less than 10 minutes! Our server was polite, if a bit slow.  She was running around like crazy though.  She seemed to have tables all over the restaurant, which didn't make any sense. We ordered some iced coffees and a couple ""small plates"" to start off with.  We decided to try the polenta fries, and the tomato basil mozzarella flatbread.  The apps took a very very long time to come out, and the iced coffee didn't even come out until after we had almost finished the apps!  The polenta fries were pretty good, but the flatbread was just kind of meh.  For our entrees, my girlfriend ordered the meat loaf and I ordered the veggie burger.    The veggie burger seemed to be rice based, and actually wasn't too bad.  It was very crumbly though and hard to eat without having it explode all over my plate.  My girlfriend ended up taking one bite of the meatloaf and couldn't stomach a second bite.  She normally loves meat loaf, but said it tasted really funky.  A manager came over and was apologetic and took it off the bill for us.  She ended up getting a club sandwich to go, since ""It's pretty hard to screw up a club sandwich."" For dessert, we ended up going with the peanut butter cheesecake which was really great.  Probably the highlight of the meal for me.  It makes sense that they are called Cheesecake Factory! If your frame of reference is TGI Fridays, Chili's, Applebee's, etc... then you will probably think Cheesecake Factory has excellent food quality.  But if you compare them next to any legitimate local 4 or 5 star restaurant - or even a higher end chain like J Alexanders - Cheesecake Factory falls flat on its face.  Most of the food we had was at least decent (meatloaf excluded), but it was nothing special. I'll probably give them another shot when the hype dies down.  They have a pretty large menu, so I'd like to try a few more items before coming to my final conclusion.  Right now they sit at 2 stars with an opportunity to improve."
Bryan A.,"West Bloomfield Township, MI",0,131,,3.0,3/2/2015,"Pros: Excellent food and great values (the serving sizes are enormous).  Easy parking and stuff to do while you wait for your table, which you will from 40 minutes to 4 hours. Cons: Questionable service, long waits for seating and cramped seating (you might be seated within 18 inches of a complete stranger). A good place to splurge on some excellent fare.  You will be killing time in the 12 Oaks Mall while you wait for your table so if you're not a ""Mall Person"" the overall experience is just OK.  If you despite malls and some less than professional service, stay away.  By the way, I have been to CFs in Anaheim and Ft. Lauderdale and both were far superior in terms of the employees."
Gina P.,"Southgate, MI",3,9,,5.0,8/16/2015,"I've been to Cheesecake Factory all over the country and I never had a good experience here until I came to the Novi location, great service, food and the patio was beautiful!!! Highly recommended location :-)"
Amy H.,"Ferndale, MI",532,208,221,3.0,1/8/2014,"Good food, good ambience, slow service. I came here for lunch on a weekday because I had a day off, and the bf accompanied me. We were surprised that we had to wait on a weekday for lunch to be seated, but once we sat down, we understood why: service and good are painfully slow.  I ordered off their Skinny menu, which is actually quite good! My bf had a sandwich, and it was pretty good. We decided on a cheesecake together, and it was pretty good.  I noticed there were several birthdays happening, and the waitstaff who sing happy birthday are actually good singers who were harmonizing! Pretty cool.  If you're looking to linger over your lunch and enjoy the ambience, this is a pretty good place."
Brenda W.,"Barberton, OH",0,3,,5.0,8/15/2015,"I've always loved the Cheesecake Factory. There isn't one close to my home, so when I get the chance, I love to have their Chicken Ramano dish. Love their breads too!"
Sula N.,"Charter Township of Clinton, MI",0,2,,2.0,6/19/2015,"The environment the food was soo good but the customer service was bad bad , when we stepped inside and went to the counter the receptionist ignored us after looked to us and start talk to her coworker and after waiting few more minutes she said how can I help you with ignoring face , after we had a set and start order our drinkers and food another waiter came with our drinks and put them on the table with really rude and bad attitude  I'm not going to that location any more ,they need to hire people with good customer service"
Nee V.,"Royal Oak, MI",0,19,,3.0,2/21/2015,"I had been looking forward to coming here for quite some time. We came during the week early around 11 and got right in which was really nice. However, not even 5 minutes after they seated us, they seat another party of people right next to us (very close, one of those shared booths), which normally I wouldn't care about, but the whole restaurant was open for seating. So, that was a little awkward. Then, our waitress came out and she was excellent. She explained the menu, was very patient answering any questions, and was very sweet and polite. My husband ordered some kind of chicken sandwich, while I got a pasta dish. Mine was pretty good. The portion size was huge, which they are known for. However, my husband's chicken sandwich was pretty undercooked on one large part. Then, we ordered the Godiva cheesecake for dessert which was awesome. So, overall a 'meh' experience. Maybe we'd try it again, but pretty pricey for just decent food. Go for the cheesecake only!"
Dion T.,"Ypsilanti, MI",1,50,,4.0,9/19/2013,"We just went again; I'm still a fan, the food is superb, and the waitstaff still had each others' backs. HOWEVER.......... my dish had a piece of rubber tubing in it (didn't find it until I got the leftovers home). Literally, a small piece of rubber tube, about 1/8 of an inch long, and black to match the black beans I had. I was in the Army for a bit, and some of our MREs weren't as tasty as the rubber tube, so it was gross but I'm already pre-conditioned for this. I just let a manager know, and we're gonna get something in the mail. Of course I'd like it to be an entire Godiva cheesecake, but I'm sure it'll be something to cover the cost of the dish. We'll see. Enjoy!"
B G.,"Detroit, MI",0,30,,3.0,12/19/2014,"Had lunch at the cheesecake factory. The lady I was with loves cheesecake. Many people the restaurant love cheesecake. This is my second or third time you have a meal there. There a couple things are pretty standard. Expect to wait. They give you a deeper but not inside the mall, just within cheesecake factory restaurant.  We were told 30 to 40 minute wait, which turned into an hour and 15 minute wait. The place is busy with a lot of very happy people. The cheesecake is good. It's expensive, but it's good. The entrée items are very large portions, expensive and nicely prepared. I had the  half a chicken salad sandwich and cup of soup.The sandwich was kind of boring but was enough for a meal in itself. The cup of soup was actually a bowl, and was very good. The only dilemma with that is the only had one type of soup. My date was allergic to mushrooms so she had to substitute. By the time we finished, there was no way we were going to eat cheesecake. Unfortunately that was the reason we were there. It took a long time for us to get to a table. It also took a long time for the waitress to take our order, fill our order. The place is very busy when we started at 12:30 but at three o'clock when we were finishing it was half empty. Mind you the waitress had no problem flirting with the bus boys standing 2 feet away from our table. When you look at the reviews, but all over the board. Some people love cheesecake so they rank it high. Some people hate the wait so they rank at low.I think the next time read them all and someone wants to go to the cheesecake factory, I'm going to ask for a table, take the pager and then go to Coney Island and eat.By the time we're done we can then go get cheesecake without a wait.It will be a lot cheaper."
Susan R.,"Novi, MI",0,16,,3.0,3/21/2014,"We have been big fans of the Cheesecake Factory chain for years but this one doesn't live up to the brand yet. We went there for lunch and when my husbands food came it did not look good. He mentioned it to the waitress and she offered to bring him something else. However she then came back to the table and told us her manager had said she would have to charge us extra for the second dish, rather than just replacing the first dish. I felt horrible for her that she had to come break that news to us after she had tried initially to do the right thing. I thought that showed a lack of integrity by the manager and lack of customer service.  All that being said, the food is still good overall and the atmosphere is beautiful. It is still a Cheesecake Factory so that makes it good buy I think they are still trying to work out some of the kinks when it comes to service."
Sharmistha D.,"Chicago, IL",374,94,50,2.0,11/4/2013,"Horrible horrible service!  I was initially annoyed that it took 1.5 hours to get seated, when we were told 45 min. Then I realized why the wait is so long.. . Their waitstaff is inexperienced, slow to come take orders and the kitchen is slow to come out with the food.  Seriously the worst service I have ever had and I  went on a Monday night.   The reason they still get 2 stars is for the food which is pretty good.  However I had a hard time enjoying my food since everyone else at the table had already gotten their food 15 minutes before I did."
Jake S.,"Canton, MI",1,4,6,4.0,2/18/2014,I had the frozen iced mango it was fantastic. I had the Tuscan tortilla soup I loved it. Then I had the Shrimp and Chicken Gumbo it was not too spicy. It was a little pricey and the decor was not what I expected. The waitress was very friendly. Overall the food was good.
Melanie S.,"Birmingham, MI",4,207,,4.0,9/8/2016,"My daughter and I had lunch there before an afternoon of shopping.  I had the Chicken Tostada Salad and my daughter the guacamole salad with grilled chicken.  We chose this restaurant because it didn't have a waiting line when we arrived and both of us were interested in trying the food.  Our meals were preceded by warm sourdough and pumpernickel bread.  Our beverages arrived fairly quickly.  My iced tea was refilled at least three times but my daughter's hot tea was not refreshed when it emptied.  We were both happy with our choices but I was somewhat dismayed at the number of flies in the restaurant.  I don't know if the doors are kept open or how these flies got in but there are too many!  I kept a menu and swatted them away.  We came back at the end of our shopping, around 4:15pm, with the intention of getting dessert.  The line was inside and outside for both seating and takeout.  We chose takeout and for one piece of pumpkin cheesecake it took 30 minutes!?!!  I would not recommend young children for this restaurant because they would fry out, as would their parents, in the wait.  You must present yourself for a reservation.  As we were leaving a woman seeking a table for 7 who had just called was told her wait would be 90 minutes.  She came because she was told the wait was only 20 when she called.  Not a happy camper to say the least.  Try it only between the main hours of eating if you want to be seated in a timely manner."
