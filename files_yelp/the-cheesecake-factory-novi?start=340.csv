Jacqueline D.,"Marshall, MI",49,64,469,3.0,9/9/2013,"We had to wait 60-85 minutes, that was fine, we walked around the mall.  This place is way too busy.  Our waitress was nice but you can tell she may have been overwhelmed, busy or just an off day.   As previous reviews, they do have some kinks they need to sort out.   The food is the same as any other cheesecake factory."
ViCtOrfirst A.,"Grand Blanc Township, MI",1,20,11,4.0,4/26/2014,"I read many negative comments on this restaurant, honestly i was hesitated a little bit, but i decided to test my sixth sense. I went to the mall first and I spent almost 4 hours wandering around. I entered the restaurant and i told to wait 45 min to get the pager, i said Ok then i came back on time and got the pager and they told me i may need 90 Minutes to be seated!! I remembered all comments about waiting ! I said Ok i will wait, after 20 Minutes the pager started to vibrate! I didn't believe so i run inside and got seat in few minutes. This is about waiting story, it was in Saturday night so it was not that bad. The food and service and absolutely the cake was Yummy. I will come back for sure."
Katerina R.,"New Baltimore, MI",2,33,17,5.0,9/2/2013,"I am fan of this restaurant chain. I even wrote  them few yeas ago and asked to open it in Mi, Partridge or Somerset...they answer me that something in economy of Mi is not ok to open it. Anyway! its happened. kinda far..but food worth it. we went there on Wednesday.. so we hoped it will be no line:) it was:) 2 -3 hours if u want table for 3.... we were lucky to get bar spot. food is awesome as always!"
mike l.,"Royal Oak, MI",1,23,,4.0,4/9/2016,"This is a great family place with many menu choices. The prices are average, the service is good. I would go back."
Erica W.,"Novi, MI",43,50,93,4.0,12/27/2014,"I hadn't ever visited a Cheesecake Factory prior to the one being built in Novi. I was excited to try it out when it first opened and ended up waiting 3 hours to eat- but it had only been open about a month. I went with a group of my girlfriends and we all tried different appetizers, entrees, and desserts. Everything had great taste and great plated display, but it did take awhile to get. (Hint, do not go when you are starving) When my birthday came around in the summer, I knew I wanted to try going back for lunch to try it out again. We showed up right when it opened, and there was already a small linen that had formed in the hallway. Amazing at how busy this place gets! I will say that all of the people I've visited with have mentioned that this location is a much smaller location than others. Both times I ordered the orange chicken and s'mores cheesecake for dessert, I plan on going back again this week and maybe I'll switch up my order a bit- we will see!"
Nassrine ..,"Dearborn, MI",1,26,26,2.0,1/22/2016,"Very long wait and it is definitely not worth it. The menu is about 14 pages long, probably more. I have had cheesecakes several times but I finally wanted to try out the food. The extensive menu immediately made me doubtful about my choice. There are way too many options and I think its merely  impossible for any chef to learn all of those dishes and prepare them properly. The Firecracker Salmon looked appetizing as they displayed it on a monitor in the waiting area. BTW there isn't really a designated waiting area, people just stand around the desk or stand outside the door near the entrance of the mall. The beeper doesn't reach far so you can't really do much while waiting. The salmon did not taste fresh at all or look like the picture they displayed. Random pieces of raddish were just thrown on the plate for design but it did not make it look or taste more appetizing. I got a pasta dish and the pasta tasted very slimy and did not have the right texture at all. It was boiled for far too long and the sauce that was added was extremely watered down so it gave the plate no taste(that it needed). The shrimp was even cooked improperly and did not have any seasoning on it.  I will come back but just for dessert."
Lisa F.,"Lincoln Park, MI",42,73,264,5.0,3/13/2014,Awesome first time experience.  I had the filet mignon.  Was delicious.  My drink was the bomb called typhoon punch. Hubby had the teriyaki chicken said it was OK.  Son had the pulled pork sandwich loved it. Sons gf had a mushroom Burger. Loved it. Got pineapple cheesecakes to go and raspberry cheesecake both awesome    our wait on a Thursday night at 6pm  was 35 min
Emily E.,"Ann Arbor, MI",20,16,,4.0,6/4/2015,"I've been twice to this location, as well as to the one in Sacramento, CA. I like the Crispy Chicken Costoletta and the Crispy Fried Cheese with marinara sauce. The food has been good and consistent at both locations with lots of leftovers due to the generous portions, which makes the prices more reasonable. The cherry and strawberry cheesecake slices have also been good. It always seems to be extremely busy -- avoid the long wait by eating at the bar."
Mahinalani A.,"Southgate, MI",21,21,31,2.0,8/17/2014,"Not sure what the hype is all about. The menu is very overwhelming.  Wait was only 20 minutes. Service was good but food, meh.   I had the salmon which I've ordered at other chain restaurant's. 5 snow peas used as garnish. Thick white sauce on the bottom of plate did not taste good. Don't know what purpose it served. Cheescake factory did not measure up.  Having a low carb cheescake option is a nice touch.  My husband ordered strawberry shortcake for dessert. Biscuit  was dry. He ate the ice cream and strawberries.  My wait time was shorter than most which was great! Overall not worth the money for mediocre food. Our bill was $68 for 2 people. My husband and I go out to eat at least once a week and don't mind paying for food that taste good. Could have went elsewhere and received same type of service and better tasting food. Probably won't be back."
Oliver W.,"Berlin, Germany",7,3,9,5.0,1/2/2014,"Burgers apparently also available as (kinda mushy but ok) veggie burgers. But ... Toasted Marshmallow S'Mores Galore + Adam's Peanut Butter Fudge Ripple + Pumpkin & Pumpkin Pecan Cheesecakes. Seriously, I was just Tebowing for a moment and sent a thank you prayer to the gods of food. This is so unbelievably good I want to cry now."
Kristy R.,"Waterford Township, MI",6,7,2,4.0,4/10/2015,Service was great and food is delicious. I got the chicken Romano and it's delicious. Only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is the wait. An hour an 45 minute wait. Luckily we knew this time and put our name in before shopping.
J D.,"Troy, MI",0,89,1,3.0,11/8/2015,"It was good food and their service was EXCELLENT but it didn't quite live up to the hype. Our waitress was wonderful. The drive, the wait, and then the food quality kind of soured it. Followed by a $43 bill for a drink, pasta, and cake before tip and it's safe to say I won't be coming back very soon. Also I have to say I've had better cheesecake. The texture of the tiramisu cheesecake was somewhat unpleasant."
Regina B.,"Belleville, MI",1,6,,4.0,5/24/2015,"There is generally always a wait for this place during peak dining times, so call ahead if you don't want to wait. I really enjoy this place - it's a restaurant that delivers consistently on food, service, and value for money.  The food is really nice. It's not fine dining, but it's super flavorful and well made, and the portions are incredibly generous. What I end up taking home with me is at least 2 more meals. The cheesecake of course is fabulous, but that's a given. Service here is always great. I've never had to wait to be greeted, never had a drink sitting empty, and servers consistently check in to make sure you don't need anything. They're friendly and quick, which is a great combination. For the price you pay, you get way better food, way better service than any other chain restaurant. Very much a fan."
Paul D.,"Royal Oak, MI",74,29,,1.0,1/2/2015,"I'm not writing this about the food, but about their non-reservation policy. If a restaurant consistently have 2.5 to 3 hr they should really consider taking reservations. I've eaten at CF around the country and have never experienced this before."
Dawn V.,"Milford, MI",8,10,33,4.0,2/28/2015,"Good food, good cheesecake.  The drinks are overpriced! Menu is way too large, need a day just to read everything on the menu. Lol!"
Johnny B.,"Novi, MI",49,24,38,1.0,8/1/2015,"Over rated place. The Food quality was notable not worth the price, cheesecake was the best thing going for them. Not what I was expecting at all. Waiting about an hour for really nothing. And the environment just felt very very ghetto! Hence the reason why I have been trying to avoid this place for the longest. Not the best place to go especially with your family!!!!"
Claudia G.,"Troy, MI",0,4,,2.0,5/6/2015,"First of all: when I was walking into the Cheesecake Factory yesterday evening, I thought it looks like it deserves more than 2.9 stars on Yelp, but I have to say now - This is completely justified (if not even overrated). I rate my experience at restaurants on the basis of 3 components (Food, Service, Speed):  - Food (2.0) Appetizer: The Nachos we ordered as appetizers were okay for bar food, but not worth $11! Processed Cheese that didn't taste like anything, and soaked through Nachos is what we got. Not overly impressed. Entrees: my husband and one of our friends had the Imperial chicken and SHRIMP, but the kitchen staff apparently forgot to put even a single piece of shrimp in there. They ate it anyway, because at that point we had waited for our food for 40 minutes already (and for a table for about 40 minutes as well). I ordered the Steak Tips with Mashed Potatoes off of the skinny menu (because earlier Yelp reviews scared me, mentioning the high calorie content of the regular menu;)). The steak was drenched in salt (and I am not a picky eater, neither a person who cares about their sodium intake), and the asparagus tasted moldy. I complained and had the waiter bring me a completely unsalted version of the steak tips. It took 30 minutes until I received it (and the others were already done eating). This second attempt was less salty, but had the consistency of a shoe sole (veeeeery chewy). I ate it anyway (at least the mashed potatoes), because at this point it was 8:50pm (ish) already. Apparently that is what you get for trying to eat healthier ;) stupid me! - Service (1.0) We (a party of 5) came in at 7pm and they told us we would have a waiting time of 55 minutes. We kind of expected that and went to the bar to grab an appetizer and a drink. (at this point I should mention that one of our friends is pregnant and cannot eat certain foods, such as not pasteurized cheeses). We ordered the Nachos with cheese and asked our waitress what kind of cheese it is, to make sure our friend could eat it, too. The waitress just looked at us and said ""well, it's melted and shredded cheese"". After that we asked again what KIND of cheese it is, and she just went on explaining that it is a melted cheese blend. She obviously had no idea, but did not consider asking the kitchen staff as well.  When our buzzer went off, my husband and I went to check out the table, while our friends cashed out at the bar. The lady responsible for seating the customers led us to a table for 2, which obviously was not big enough. She apologized and had the staff put together two small tables, which was still way too small and barely fit all our plates (the high tops at the bar were bigger than this table). As for our entrees: my husband ordered Bang Bang Chicken, but they didn't have that anymore, so he switched to the Imperial Chicken and Shrimp, but asked the waiter if he could get grilled chicken instead of breaded chicken. The waiter asked in the kitchen and came back explaining ""we can do it, but it will probably take away from the taste. When we use breading, we bread the chicken. When we don't bread it, I have no idea if it is still as good. You will have to order it at your own risk"" (great statement, right?:P). - Speed (2.0) as mentioned before it took about 40 minutes until we got our entrees (and we didn't order fancy stuff), and an additional 30 minutes for my second try with the steak tips. Bottom line: Probably good food if it were a bar, but I would have expected more from the Cheesecake Factory. Insanely overpriced and salty and fatty. We didn't get to try the cheesecake in the end, because we were so annoyed, and some of us very full (the portions are insanely big!). I know for sure that we will not go back there. Very disappointing experience..."
Stephanie W.,"Canton, MI",109,139,24,4.0,1/2/2014,"Yay! A Cheesecake Factory FINALLY arrived in Michigan!!!! I think it's been around for a few months, but I was waiting for the hype (and more importantly, the line) to die down a bit. Even now, be prepared to wait. I got lunch here. Some bowtie pasta with mushrooms, sun-dried tomatoes, and chicken. It was very good. I appreciate that Cheesecake Factory always has very consistent food. The pasta has always been cooked well, with generous, quality meats and veggies. Even though I was full after half of my pasta, I split a mango key lime cheesecake with my friend. I mean, it's a CHEESECAKE factory. The cheesecake was very tasty and light. I'm not sure I could have handled the more hardcore cheesecakes, haha. Just one small issue: there was a pretty strong aftertaste of lard in a couple bites of the cheesecake. Maybe they didn't mix some of the filling well enough? :( Usually, I've no issue with their desserts. I think the decor here is a pretty classy. The one in Chicago is so gaudy and... lumpy. This Twelve Oaks Cheesecake Factory was nice and sunny, too. Our server was very quick and did a great job. It looked like the whole restaurant was well staffed and equipped to serve its many visitors."
Sharmeka S.,"Rochester, MI",1,2,2,2.0,4/26/2015,The staff was very rude!!! We were told the wait would be a hour and a half and that turned into over three hours. Went to the host station to collect a buzzard and check our wait time I was told that it would be one hour to two hours longer. When I expressed that it had already been a hour the host asked me was I done talking and proceeded to assist another customer. After 3 hours we were finally seated I ordered a alcoholic beverage that was a waste of money you couldn't taste the alcohol not even a hint. I told the server that I was unhappy with my drink and she suggested I pay for a shot on the side. The server was very short with us so she could spend time at the other tables talking. The staff could use some training in the customer service area. I can't say I will be visiting the Cheesecake Factory in Michigan ever again. I've had better service at other Cheesecake Factories out of state. Btw my fried mac and cheese balls were small and looked like I made them myself. My experience was not worth the wait. I only stayed because my sister really wanted to go for her birthday.
S M.,"Novi, MI",8,27,,4.0,5/31/2015,"High quality food at a cheaper price and menu large enough to satisfy anyone, my go to place for indecisive eating."
