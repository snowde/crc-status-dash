Dawnette R.,"Cedar Springs, MI",0,1,1,5.0,4/16/2014,"After reading some of the reviews we were hesitant to try this Cheesecake Factory. So glad we didn't listen. I think the overall wait times obviously influenced the other reviews. We went for lunch on a Wednesday and had no wait. We were seated, ate, had our leftovers and 4 pieces of cheesecake packaged to go in less than an hour. The food and service was every bit as awesome as it was at the Cheesecake Factory in Chicago. We will definitely be going back."
Lindsey T S.,"Birmingham, MI",110,248,430,5.0,10/9/2013,"COULDN'T BE HAPPIER THAT THIS OPENED. honestly, its been a dream of mine for this to open in Michigan !! I went on opening night and sat in the bar area - its so much fun because everyone there loves the cheesecake factory & people really bond over that Love that lauau salad - and avocado egg rolls are a must !! its a smaller venue that i would have thought"
Cassie W.,"Crivitz, WI",0,12,7,5.0,4/11/2014,"BANG BANG CHICKEN was amazing. Food was VERY good! Only downside was the wait--we got around that by coming during the lunch hour, still a 1.5 hr wait, but we wandered the mall in the meantime.  Bang bang chicken, cheese bread, and cheese cake!"
Nicole M.,"Canton, MI",0,1,,1.0,8/23/2015,"The food was horrible. The waitress got our order wrong. It took over a half hour to get our food and it came out in pieces. Five people in our party, and each one of us got our food 5-10 minutes apart. Manager only offered one free piece of cheesecake to compensate, and our waitress never got it for us. We left, it was a horrible experience. Do not recommend, not worth the wait our price."
Andy S.,"Walled Lake, MI",155,59,,2.0,3/25/2015,"Wait times are ridiculous, even during the week, food is good, huge menu, but everything including cheesecake is way overpriced for what it is, don't see the big draw really as you can find the same or similar food elsewhere for much less with little to no wait, ruby Tuesday has slices of cheesecake that are twice the size, better and half the price!"
Geoff W.,"Novi, MI",8,20,2,2.0,3/24/2015,"The food is average for the price and the service is very slow.  The dining is very loud and the chairs are uncomfortable.  On the positive, It is a very broad menu selection and the cheesecake portions are large.  Overall, this place is not worth the wait to sit down."
Jason M.,"Lansing, MI",31,16,20,4.0,12/29/2014,"Food is excellent, atmosphere is inviting, the desserts are out of this world. The only downside is the three hour wait that it takes to get in. Outside of that I would definitely recommend this place. Perfect for a date night or special occasion."
Shahar S.,"Livonia, MI",0,14,1,3.0,3/7/2014,I came to this place 7 times and was able  To get it once my wait time was hour and a half it seems like 2 years. The cheascake was good. But the wait not so good
Daisuke F.,"Novi, MI",18,13,1,3.0,12/18/2015,"hmm maybe had over expectation, but taste of pasta, cheese cake was average. But had a good service here!"
Alison C.,"Northville, MI",19,4,,1.0,1/11/2015,"If you have a special occasion steer clear of here. They do not take reservations,  you can't call ahead. They tell you on the phone a 1-2 hour wait but when you arrive it's more like a 5 hour wait for a table. The host was rude and basically made us feel like we were wasting his time even asking if we could get a table... Stay away."
Christa M.,"Northville, MI",3,8,2,1.0,5/5/2014,"I ordered a chicken salad and I got a huge plate of iceberg lettuce with a few skimpy toppings including about 4 pieces of shaved chicken... I'm talking thin, shaved slices... Horrible. The menu is so extensive there's no way they can stock that much quality food. Any menu that's 20 pages... No thanks."
Matt Z.,"Madison Heights, MI",0,14,14,1.0,1/3/2016,"This place is way over rated. Food is average. The place is very noisy, crowded and is not even worth a five minute wait.. We tried once and that's it. Good luck."
Brian H.,"Livonia, MI",0,3,,2.0,10/11/2015,"Can you say 1 and done.  First time there and WAS NOT impressed.  Food was not bad but you'd think that since they're always busy it wouldn't take so long for everything. Food came out one at a time and it was like pulling teeth to get a refill of water.  For the price and taste, burgers are better at Red Robin.  I have no idea why so many people go back.  Hour wait and slow service.  Our waitress was friendly and did her best, but I won't be going back."
Chris S.,"Auburn Hills, MI",22,27,2,4.0,11/15/2014,"You go here for the cheesecake, not the ambience or the food. That said, wait staff was exceptional and the food was really good. There were also gluten-free options for my daughter and I. However, the wait time on a table, especially for 4 on a Friday night, is beyond ridiculous. Know what you are in for, and you'll enjoy yourself..."
J P.,"Windsor, Canada",0,7,,2.0,7/29/2016,"Me and my fiancé recently visited this place and I doubt we will return. We ordered the salad and pizza lunch deal with 2 Piña coladas and strawberry cheesecake. The drinks were pretty good, no complaints there. When ordering our salad the waiter asked if balsamic dressing was okay, I asked what other dressings they had and all he had to say was that they had a lot of choices. Well thanks captain obvious! We got our salads and they looked horrible! Extremely wilted and brown, they had the nerve to put fresh cucumber and tomato around the bowl which made it look 10x worse because of the colour and freshness comparison. I had 2 bites of it and ditched it. The pizza wasn't too bad, extremely doughy and for some odd reason I had 10 pepperonis stacked on top of each other. The strawberry cheesecake was actually phenomenal! I would probably only return for cheesecake and drinks because the food is not worth it. What sucks even more is that we are Canadian so $60 bill actually cost us $90. Ouchhhhh"
Chris B.,"Utica, MI",13,11,2,1.0,5/18/2014,"Now that I have been there I can cross this one off my list. The Tempura Battered Fish Tacos were good (4 stars) but not worth the hour and a half wait for the table and the two hour service. I believe the menu is too big and causes indecision at the table. It was extremely disappointing when it came time order cheesecake. They were out of a dozen cheesecake choices, even the Original. Members of my party used the restroom and reported them as ""filthy"". There will not be a return visit."
Lynne L.,"Ann Arbor, MI",0,21,1,4.0,8/5/2014,"Three stars for the service.  Two stars for the noise...it was so loud we couldn't talk to each other.  Screaming, hand gestures or texting were the best options.  Five stars for the food! The orange chicken is delicious and the cheesecake is every bit as amazing as you'd expect."
Jessica P.,"Livonia, MI",33,60,3,4.0,11/12/2015,loved the white chicken chili!
Julianne H.,"Westland, MI",34,23,3,2.0,11/11/2014,"I had to only wait 15 minutes. I got the fish tacos (I get them everywhere I go if it's on the menu) and they were honestly the worst I have ever had. No flavor at all. The service was alright. Nothing special about this place to be honest, I do not understand why there is a constant wait to get into the place?"
AVA c.,"Belleville, MI",1,2,,2.0,8/26/2014,Food is Great!! The Service Sucks!!!  1st the main dish came out w/the appetizer. 2nd I had to ask my server 2x for bread. 3rd was never offered water refill. and Last did i mention the service sucks!!! the waitress dared to care. I don't think I will be going back there again.
