Stewart H.,"Canton, MI",0,4,,2.0,8/23/2014,"Like many reviewers, I have been to several other Cheesecake Factory locations and the Novi Michigan location certainly does not live up to the level of customer service I have experienced elsewhere. I took my family of 5 out to dinner last night in celebration of my birthday. We knew there would be a long wait since it was a Friday night. When checking in at 6pm, we were informed that it would be a 75 - 90 minute wait. Fair enough. We were then informed that we would need to return to the chaotic front desk area in 45 minutes to receive our paging device. When returning after doing some shopping 45 minutes later, we had to wait in a line about 15 minutes to receive the device. So...worse case scenario, we should be paged and seated in about 30 minutes from that point. WRONG!  After multiple inquiries and a multitude of excuses, we were finally seated at 8:40p! The waitress Sarah was very prompt, courteous and efficient as I'm certain the manager we spoke with earlier informed her of our poor experience. They provided us with a complementary appetizer however at that point, it didn't feel like enough after such a long and painful wait. All in all, the food was up to par with other CF's I've been to but we certainly would not have waited 2 hours and 40 minutes to be seated if we had known up front what the real wait time was. We did not leave the restaurant until 10pm I won't be returning to this CF anytime soon."
Will S.,"Riverview, MI",0,12,,5.0,11/25/2014,Loved it! Probably the best restaurant experience I'd ever had. We got there early and didn't have to wait long. My 2 year old daughter was given complementary fruit and the food was amazing. I've been to the ones in Chicago and Pittsburgh as well and this was just as good.
Erin M.,"Novi, MI",0,57,,2.0,7/30/2015,"I've been here a handful of times and unfortunately the experiences just keep getting worse. Each time i've been there, there is usually a wait. This last time however we came in for an early dinner and were seated immediately. Unfortunately they sat us on the patio where we were sardined in amongst the other patrons. It really felt like I was seated at a table with a couple in the middle of their dinner because that's how close we were. It took almost 15 minutes before our waitress even came to take our drink order and another 15 for her to come back and get the rest of our order. As we waited our stomachs quickly reminded us that we had not received the bread basket they always give us. Looking around I see only *some* tables have them. I mention this to the person i'm dining with and then I overhear the table next to us ask the waitress why they didn't get bread. She just said ""Oh, we're out of the wheat, all we have is sourdough. Did you want that?"".  By this point it's been well over 40 minutes since we ordered and we really would have appreciated being offered bread, even if it were just the one kind.     Finally, after what seems like an eternity, our meals arrived.  The parmesan herb crusted chicken I ordered was visibly burnt and extremely greasy, yet somehow still managing to be spongey as though it were microwaved. It came with mashed potatoes, which were cold, hard, and crusted over like they had been sitting for far too long.  After sitting there for SO long, very hungry and eager to eat, the amount of disappointment I had when my meal came was enough for me to say ""I don't think i'll be returning here"".   Cheesecake Factory was an exciting new addition to the area when it first opened. Unfortunately, they have let the restaurant quickly fall apart and seem to currently be running on poor service and low kitchen standards.  Save yourself some money and go eat elsewhere, maybe just pick up a slice of cheesecake to go from here."
S E.,"Northville, MI",0,38,6,4.0,8/17/2014,"Awesome pasta dishes. Nice warm bread.    gigantic quantity, wholesome veggies and creamy sauce."
Stephanie R.,"Rochester, MI",0,2,,1.0,12/27/2014,I came to this cheesecake factory with a party of 4 at 4pm and there was a 3 hr wait. I've been to other cheesecake factory locations around the US and there has never been more than a 1 hr wait. I'd make sure to come during off hours if you want to eat at this location.
Lindsay S.,"Waterford Township, MI",18,12,2,5.0,8/19/2013,"Great place, it's brand new so the wait time is super crazy. But food is decently priced for portion size. The waitstaff is super nice, they all look very sharp in all white uniforms. Great place for a party,date or even just a family dinner. Kids teenagers and adults will love it."
Sam D.,"Toronto, Canada",0,114,168,2.0,9/12/2014,"Looking at the reviews, my experience matched up. Service was inconsistent: our server was good, the hosts were good, the person that showed us to our seats wasn't very nice. The place was very noisy. It took forever to get our food. Food was decent. Skylicious veggie salad and huevos rancheros and Godiva cheesecake."
Juju F.,"Troy, MI",0,15,1,5.0,10/29/2013,"Best experience I've had ""ever"" here in Michigan!!! Food was impeccable; service was excellent; and even though it is super new in Novi, MI, we were seated within 20 minutes while my girlfriend and I enjoyed a glass of wine at the bar. LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!!"
Mona S.,"Howell, MI",0,40,9,2.0,8/31/2014,"The service was really good. We were seated where the waiters place their orders on the computer, so it felt like they were on top of us. The chicken pacata has great sauce however not sure if the chicken was cooked all the way tasted a little off. My daughter liked her bow tie pasta from kids menu. They are stingy with the bread basket . Pop was all ice. Very expensive for what we got."
Jason R.,"Dearborn Heights, MI",0,17,,5.0,10/14/2013,"A terrific experience.  The biggest problem that exists is one that they themselves can't possibly control; the astronomical wait due to overwhelming demand.  I do not consider that something to mark them down for as a result. My fiancee and I ate there within a few days of it opening and we were totally blown away by how good the food was, how nice, helpful, and thoughtful the waitstaff was, and how happy the other patrons appeared to be.  When our waiter discovered it was our anniversary, he had the kitchen do a happy anniversary in chocolate sauce on the plate he brought my fiancee's cheesecake on. The prices aren't bad but it's easy to spend a lot because there are so many things worth trying, but everything was great and we're hoping to be back again very soon."
Sarah W.,"Livonia, MI",0,3,,5.0,11/17/2014,Always wonderful. Love the chicken picatta. Ahh I want some NOW! I had a mojito and it was very  .well
Bill S.,"Dearborn, MI",0,17,4,1.0,3/23/2014,"Over-Rated.  People go their for the name like I did!  1.5-2.5 hr wait time, 0,5-1hr more than what they tell you!  Food is Average at best. Crowded. Yet Price is above average.  Burgers, Salmon, Shrimp, Calamari: below average.  Salad: Average  Pasta and desert: above average.  Not worth the wait, the price or the food!"
Matt M.,"Northville, MI",0,3,,2.0,3/23/2014,This is ridiculous. Waiting over an hour to be seated for decent food at high prices. Last time we went they were out off Alfredo sauce. How does a restaurant with such high standards run out of something like that? Also very agitated with the poor seating and waiting staff. Will not be returning.
Grande B.,"West Bloomfield Township, MI",20,16,5,1.0,10/30/2014,"This specific location gets one star because it's supposed to be one of the best restaurants around and it certainly wasn't that. It also gets one star in comparison to other Cheesecake Factories I've been to as well as in comparison to other restaurants that are in the same genre/tier.  We went on a Sunday night and had to wait 4 hours to get in. Four hours! Part of the reason we had to wait so long was because we had a party of 13. We were celebrating my mom's birthday and she really wanted to try it out so we did...  I've been to The Cheesecake Factory in Honolulu and it was really no big deal to me. The food was fine. Not bad, not great. This time around was pretty much the same, but worse. First off, the floor was absolutely disgusting. There was so much grime on the floors that you never really had good traction  when walking. Totally gross. They needed someone to clean the floors during the busyness of the rush(es) and that clearly never happened. I ordered the Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp and the shrimp part was fantastic - I'd totally eat that again. At the same time, the rice that came with it was hard and bland. My friends and family ordered steaks and that was a complete debacle. My mom wanted the hibachi steak and was told that they ran out of that steak for the day. Odd... Then 10 minutes after we ordered, the waitress came back out to tell some other friends at our table that they didn't have the kind of steak that they wanted either. Ridiculous! Why did it take them 10 minutes after we ordered to tell us that they didn't have it??? As a result, my mom and my friends ended up ordering one kind of steak with another kind of steak's veggies and toppings - per our waitresses recommendation. You'd think that would all come out together, but no, they brought the veggies and toppings out separate and several minutes before the steaks came. This made for 4 or 5 extra plates on our table. More ridiculousness! I ended up having some of the steaks and they were just ok... I told my wife that they were like ""better versions of a steak you might find at Ponderosa"". Seems to me like this location needs new management. When in Hawaii, the Cheesecake Factory there was well run. This location was like a bad, bad impression of Hawaii's. I wanted to really enjoy this place, but they almost made it impossible.  On a brighter note, as soon as we were seated the wait staff brought out free slices of bread and bananas for all the kids we had with us. That was really nice. But not enough to offset the other stuff that happened.  If I ever go back, it'll be because someone else suggested it. I'd get the Jamaican Shrimp again for sure. But I'd be totally fine never going back there again... The cheesecake is great, but you can get great cheesecake elsewhere around these parts (Sweet Lorraine's). In the end we felt like we coulda just gone to J. Alexander's, waited for a lot less time and would've gotten better food with better service."
Jay L.,"West Bloomfield Township, MI",9,29,,2.0,10/26/2013,Much like everyone has been writing about be prepared to wait. And wait. And wait.... I have no problem waiting for a table be can't stand when I am told one thing and then another happens. Our 45 minute wait turned to well over an hour and then when we were led to be seated the table wasn't ready and stood next to it for another 15 minutes for it to be ready.  Server showed up after 15 minutes of waiting at the table to take our orders. Food (average burgers and pasta dishes at best) took 45 minutes to get out to us. Dessert (cheesecake of course) was good but after spending hours in that places between all the waiting we just wanted to leave. Didn't particularly enjoy the CF experience here.
Char H.,"Birmingham, MI",16,36,7,1.0,10/11/2013,Could the staff be any more rude? The person who took my order over the phone rushed me and was extremely rude. The girl who checked me out couldn't smile to save her life. Seriously they could give someone the job that can smile and not make ordering food so awkward. They ruined my good mood.
Crystal H.,"Livonia, MI",0,13,,3.0,7/22/2014,"I have been here twice with my sister. The food is good however make sure to ask for a booth because if you get a table you will be sitting next to people pretty closely (as in you may as well be dining with them). We never had a long wait, but dining out frequently I know not to go right at a lunch or dinner rush, which I am sure has an impact on service. No pressure on the staff, happier servers. Go about 30-45 minutes before you would normally eat. When we leave it always seems packed, obviously since its the normal eating time. We will go again, for the fried mac and cheese, YUM!"
Curley V.,"Commerce Township, MI",0,3,,1.0,9/26/2013,"If I could give this place no stars, I absolutely would. In fact, I could go on forever about how much of a disappointment this place was.However, I will try my best to be brief.  1.) After waiting for an hour ( which we had no problem with), we finally sat down and ordered our food. After another hour of waiting, we finally received our food( all at different times) only to be told by our waitress that FIVE OUT OF EIGHT DISHES WERE INCOMPLETE because they RAN OUT OF FOOD. The chicken artichoke dish had no artichoke ect... 2.) I have been to the Cheesecake factory multiple times in various states and can honestly say that their PROPORTION SIZE IS A LOT SMALLER ( I'd say by about half).  3.) So, as a result of all of this, I decided to talk to the manager. However, that was not even possible because HE NEVER CAME. Instead, he told the waitress to just give us 1 piece of cheesecake! For all 8 of us! Then, if that wasn't enough, we all realized that even the cheesecake was 1/2 the size of the portions they serve elsewhere!!!!!! Same price just with  smaller, incomplete and inconsistent food. I will never waste my money here ever again.  I'd rather go to McDonald's....."
Renee A.,"West Bloomfield Township, MI",13,63,49,1.0,2/15/2014,"ok,  so  I've  been  to  cheesecake  factory  in  Chicago  and  Vegas  and  now  we have  it  here  in  Michigan.....I  wasn't  impressed  then  and  I'm  def not  impressed  now. I  would  of  been  better  off  going  to  the  grocery  store  and  buying  the  same  ingredients  used  in  these  dishes.... and  it  would  if  been a million times better. Never again."
Katrina R.,"Sterling Heights, MI",6,11,,1.0,2/28/2016,"If you're planning on going to the cheesecake factory in Novi, you might want to rethink your plans and go elsewhere. My family and I went there to celebrate my mother's 66th birthday on Feb 28, 2016(my mother's birthday is really on March 1st), and we have waited for over an hour. It was at least 11 or 12 of use, and we wanted to sit together. We being told that they were getting our tables ready. Well, after 3 and a half hours, we finally got a seat. At least some of us, but the rest had to wait. I'm sure my sister is using a few choice of words in her mind at that moment. We didn't even get our shrimp dinner rolls they promised. The food was great, but the service was terrible. At least let us make reservation ahead of time. Well, I am never going to eat there again, and I don't think my family will either. Maybe we should have went across the hallway of the mall to CPK(California Pizza Kitchen) to dine there instead."
