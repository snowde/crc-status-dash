Allyson E.,"Charter Township of Clinton, MI",0,2,,1.0,11/12/2017,"Great food-terrible terrible guest service. If you have a party don't expect to eat here because due to the manager it's ""first come, first serve""..... what? We drove an hour for my birthday. Didn't even eat & left disgusted at the way we were treated. We were basically refused to be sat because ""it was going to be WAY to difficult to do""  I get it. Im a waitress myself. I get busy & I get big parties but for as popular as this place is you'd think they would consider a reservation or at least not uptight attitudes... won't be back any time soon"
Moe M.,"Dearborn, MI",5,29,33,4.0,12/31/2016,"This place is great. They sell a lot more then cheesecake.  They offer all kinds of foods. I got salmon when I visited. It was very good, it melts in your mouth!!!  BUT my favorite thing was the avocado egg rolls I got for an appetizer!!!! Must try! It was summer so I decided to sit outside, the inside was very crowded. Not that much of a view, I saw the parking lot lol I will definitely be back."
Jasmine C.,"Taylor, MI",0,5,1,5.0,11/7/2017,"We went here for brunch this Sunday and every visit is great but our server Cameron G made it amazing, he was great, very attentive, and didn't miss a beat. Thanks so much Cameron for making our visit awesome, oh and of course the food was yummy :-)"
Blake W.,"Saint Clair Shores, MI",2,94,5,5.0,5/19/2017,"Ok ok. The wait here is terrible but that does not take away from the service and the food. The people here are very pleasant regardless of how many entitled jerks they have to deal with. There food is always amazing and their cheesecake fills the void in your life that you didn't know existed until you take your first bite. It's like entering the matrix with your mouth. I have tried nearly every cheesecake they have (yes I know I am fat. Let's move on) and each one brings its own type of love and happiness into my life. A little tear trickles from my cheek when it arrives to the table. I don't believe it's because I'm so happy, I think I tear up because my eyes want to taste what they have been seeing for years and that's the only way they know how. My other senses are jealous and that makes for a good cheesecake.  The Diet Coke is surprisingly good too."
Angelynn J.,"Lakeland, FL",94,161,343,5.0,7/14/2017,I love Cheesecake Factory. I had my birthday dinner here and our waiter was very kind to all of us. He made sure we had everything we needed and that all of our orders were correct. It was very clean and it wasn't that bad of a wait for a table.
Remonda E.,"Warren, MI",0,6,,2.0,12/20/2017,"Went in there with a friend and waited our turn to be seated. However we sat down and waited for about ten minutes until our waitress approached us.  She didn't check on us until we were finished with our meals. Although, they were really busy but still. The hot spinach and cheese dip was good but not the best I've had. I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs as my meal, and it was not that good. Definitely not worth the price I paid for. Next time I think I'm going to skip this place and go elsewhere. I don't mind spending the money if I get good food and service."
Laura B.,"Oakland County, MI",25,172,15,3.0,7/15/2017,"Five stars for the cheesecakes. One star for the long wait times. Three stars for food quality. Two stars for the prices.  I've been eating at Cheesecake Factories for years, and have visited six locations total in four states. The best thing about Cheesecake Factory is of course the cheesecakes. They're amazing. At other locations in Texas and Nevada I'd pop in and buy slices at the to-go counter all the time. Here though, it's a 20-30 minute wait just to stand in line and get a cheesecake to go! It's ridiculous. I've stopped trying. Waiting for a table can take over an hour. This wouldn't be so bad if they would move to a text-message waiting system, so that you could shop in the mall while you wait. Instead they still give out old-fashioned clunky beepers that don't have a wide enough range to do anything but sit and wait in the hallway.  Cheesecake Factory's food has always been moderately good with enormous portions and ridiculously high prices. I don't mind paying big bucks for food if the price is commensurate with the quality. I've never felt that Cheesecake's is worth the money it costs. That's why I prefer to just buy dessert to go.  Overall: This is the worst Cheesecake Factory I've visited. But the cheesecake is amazing, so I put up with it on occasion."
Dan M.,"Farmington, MI",0,4,,1.0,10/23/2017,I came here to pick up a cheesecake for a friend that was phone ordered and it took them almost an hour to find it. The manager did not even look for the last name on the order and was just giving my wife and I a hard time. I wouldn't give this place my service next time if the food was for free. Restaurant service here was comparable to stopping at a fast food joint in an inner city. Don't remember the restaurant manager's name but he definitely shouldn't be in any customer service position and DEFINITELY NOT A RESTAURANT MANAGER!!!
Debora K.,"Foley, AL",0,5,,2.0,12/18/2017,"Had a very disappointing experience. Signed in at 3:45 and was seated at 5:20, so if your in a hurry stay away! Food took so very long to come out and to pay our bill took 25 mins. We did not leave the restaurant till 7:45, did a lot of waiting. Will never go back, not worth it! Food was ok, very pricey."
Stephanie L.,"Macomb, MI",61,17,14,3.0,6/19/2017,"I'm a huge cheesecake fan and I wasn't really blown away. I had a Cobb salad with chicken and avocado which wasn't bad. The service was really slow. Ended the meal by sharing two cheesecakes, the Oreo and white chocolate hazelnut. I also had a double espresso."
Maha A.,"Dearborn, MI",19,174,82,3.0,6/7/2017,"I got their pasta and I was quite disappointed not enough Alfredo in the Alfredo, very dry. The cheesecake however was wonderful!"
Nathasja T.,"Northville, MI",242,586,947,3.0,9/17/2016,"Like most others, the Cheesecake Factory was a 'have to go here' place when I'd be out of town. Now that I have one in my backyard.. I literally never go! It's not that I changed my mind on the food (well, a little) - it's just that this CF is not the best iteration of this chain. Somehow, service is *always* slow and barely friendly.  Just like my water is always barely full (i.e. on super empty throughout my meal) and my food is barely warm.  The waits are long but that's because this restaurant is tiny, especially considering the size of usual Cheesecake Factories.  I don't understand why they insist on these ridiculous portion sizes.. one meal is literally three meals. For this reason I stick to items that reheat fairly well (chicken and potatoes, for example, or the pasta davinci), the small plates menu, or a salad. And usually the food is good.. it's not mind blowing, but it's good and if prepared the way it's explained on the menu - it's consistent.   Salads here are pretty spectacular - when they come out correctly. During my most recent attempt at eating here I ordered the kale/quinoa/avocado/cranberry/onion/Brussel sprout salad with grilled salmon. Salmon is fantastic - zero complaints there (get it!).  The problem is that my salad, which *on paper* sounds well-balanced flavor- and texture wise, ended up being a big plate filled with kale.  They were out of half the ingredients for the salad and long story short; a plate full of raw kale is not all that appetizing.  It's a consistency and service thing for me. Don't put out product that's half-assed, if you're out of ingredients let people know.. common sense, peeps. WINNERS: 1. mushroom soup! 2. white chocolate raspberry cheesecake 3. the breadddd 4. salmon"
Chesley B.,"Detroit, MI",0,72,3,4.0,12/1/2016,"Arrived @ opening 11:00 am, the cocktail drinks are a ruse  tall attractive drinking glasses, lots of garnishment but little alcohol . My Stuffed Mushrooms, Bang Bang Chicken and  Shrimp was very tasty ! spicy with a Thai Curry sauce. Our spring roll sampler platter was also flavorful. Great host staff and charming waitress Emily. Loved the music, the overall atmosphere."
Catherine B.,"Lennon, MI",9,13,,2.0,10/10/2017,Service is slow. Food is very disappointing and expensive. Drinks are pricey. Nice atmosphere and good cheesecake.  A good place to throw away your money! So sad.
Victor B.,"Canton, MI",27,12,116,5.0,5/28/2017,Crab cakes are the best that I've tasted. Perfectly seasoned and not over cooked. Their menu has over 200 items to choose from including a menu if your watching your calorie intake. The Cheesecakes that I tried were all delicious. Lemon Meringue and the Key Lime are highly recommended.
Suzanna F.,"Redford Charter Township, MI",0,46,,4.0,5/24/2017,Excellent cheesecake despite the long lines! We also enjoy many of the entrees. Servers are always friendly. It's a good choice when you visit the mall if you don't have to wait too long.
Rodrigo T.,"Lincoln Park, MI",323,790,2216,4.0,1/11/2016,"Thee Cheesecake Factory!! Ok, the first time I ever ate at a Cheesecake Factory was at Sacramento about 5 to 6 years ago. It was quite some time ago, but the experience was very good. It's not just a place for you to order up cheesecakes. Their food is actually very good. But be prepared to wait for a table, this is basically the ONLY cheesecake factory here in Michigan. So yes, people do make the pilgrimage just to have a crack at it. Appetizer of choice,, the chicken samosas. Those things are addictive, trust me on that. Then entree' of choice for me would be the Chicken Marsala or the Shepherds Pie. Those two things, you can never go wrong. Dishes so good, you'd prolly lick the plate when you're done. Come early and put your name on the list right away. Go shopping and just check from time to time to see if your time has shortened. I always expect a bit of wait, just because I wouldn't be shocked if there was one. I just put my name on the list and go shopping, then check back afterwards. Hopefully they'll open another one. In Downtown Detroit **hint**"
Larry O.,"Detroit, MI",11,42,10,4.0,4/13/2017,Love the Cheesecake Factory. Not a huge fan of the wait when coming here but the food always makes the wait seem like nothing at all.
R G.,"Canton, MI",0,37,1,2.0,6/11/2017,"The Pros: -I appreciated that they cut up my son's grilled cheese in bite size portions. -The fried cauliflower The cons: -From the time we sat down at ourto the time we left was two hours and 15 minutes.  And our dessert was ordered to go.  Just really slow.  Including the wait, it was over a 3 hour trip.  Not ideal with an 18 month old. - The menu is way too big. -Kinda grumpy staff.  I asked the person who sat us for a high chair and he said, ""someone else will bring you one."" After asking someone else 5-10 minutes later we finally got one.  We just stood awkwardly while we waited."
Cara W.,"Livonia, MI",84,26,7,3.0,3/16/2017,"This is a good place to get a nice meal if you have plenty of time. The wait, in my experience, has never been less than forty five minutes and due to the constant rush of people, service isn't as speedy as most would prefer. Dinner here can definitely stretch anywhere from 2-3.5 hours if you plan on an appetizer, main meal, and dessert.  My table split the fried mac 'n cheese for an appetizer. Three out of the four were very good, but the fourth wasn't cooked all the way through.  I had a salad as my meal, which was good for the most part. I have no complaints, but suggest asking for dressing on the side if you aren't a heavy dressing person.  I had lemon raspberry cheesecake for dessert - this was very good and very filling. I took home about half.  Keep in mind portion sizes are large and do make very good leftovers!"
