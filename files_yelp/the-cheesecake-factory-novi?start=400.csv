Judy P.,"West Bloomfield Township, MI",2,1,,4.0,9/29/2014,Love this place! Besides all the yummy selection of cheese cake (hence the name ;D ) they have a pretty good selection of meals . Not so expensive considering the quality and quantity of food you're getting. The MI location is somewhat new so I guess that explains the long lines (specially on weekends) but the wait is worth it. Will definitely come back.
George M.,"Clarkston, MI",2,12,,2.0,10/10/2013,"If you're not interested in reading all of this, skip down to the summary.  I've never experienced any other Cheesecake Factory's before as I've lived in Michigan my entire life, so I have nothing to compare this too. I'm just comparing this to any other restaurant I'd eat at.  When it comes down to it, this place is really weird. Some things are great but most things are just... barely okay.  When you walk in the first thing you see are high ceiling and some strange decor. Not sure who the interior decorator was, but he had some weird taste. But whatever, this is about food not color schemes.  First off, I came in on Wednesday at 3pm and there was told a half hour wait. I'm not sure why. I saw plenty empty tables. I didn't want to wait, I immediately knew it wasn't going to be worth it. My company insisted on at least trying it, so I obliged.  Waited 20 minutes, still not great and I assume they just overshoot the time anyways so people will feel better getting a table sooner-than-expected. A man set us down at a small two-person table along a very long bench. Very cramped. Not a lot of moving around room and there are people about 1-2 feet away from you. You can hear their conversation, and they can hear yours. Waiter took 3-4 minutes to arrive with water and take our drink orders. Water is good for me. My company ordered something, took another 3 minutes for that to arrive.  Meanwhile, we're fronted with an absolutely staggeringly huge menu. It's 21 pages. It has advertisements in the menu. Advertisements. In. A. Menu. This is the first time I ever saw ads in a menu and was blown away. I don't understand. Really, the menu is just too big. It has 5 pages of specialties. This place specializes in over 30 items of stuff ranging from Chinese to Mongolian to American to French? They call their burgers glamburgers. I had a chuckle at that. But seriously, 21 pages of items. I'm an indecisive person. It took to me forever to get a even basic picture of what they serve. Maybe some people like a menu consisting of a minimum of 200 items. I don't. I can't imagine a chef being able to perfect over 200 items in a chain restaurant. This isn't a Michelin starred restaurant.  Meat sounded good, so I decided on a burger since I doubted the 3pm Wednesday chef could cook an excellent steak (prime fillet cost $30). Steak is just one of those things for me that if I'm going to have I'd like it to be awesome. Call me smug, but an Outback steak just doesn't cut it.  Anyways, I had the Kobe Burger. Food arrive in a quick fashion. During this time, our waiter has yet to be seen since they took our order, which was about 15 minutes ago. They did not bring our food, someone else did. Another 5 minutes went by until they appeared, but only to say ""Enjoy your food"" and then to run off. Didn't leave any room to ask for something. I wasn't served any condiments with my burger or fries or offered any. So, after not seeing her for the past 20 minutes, I kind of shrugged and decided to eat it anyways.  Surprisingly, the Kobe Burger tasted pretty good. I ordered medium rare, received medium, but it tasted good. Mind you, it wasn't stunning, but I was happy with it. The fries were also surprisingly good. So, despite everything, I'd say the food is pretty good. However, again, our waiter did not appear for another 10 minutes. They came by to serve another table across from us, did not look our way. Came by another 5 minutes but to ask that same table if everything was okay. I could hear her. She didn't look our way. Finished our meals, glasses empty. Waited another 5 minutes for the check. Received the check, needed it spit (was not asked if together or separate, not something I immediately think about). Took another 2 minutes to receive that. Overall, wasted a lot of time. I'm beginning to understand why the wait is so long.  -- Summary -- This place is okay. Not great. Comparatively, there are a lot better places, CPK being one of them across the corridor.  Seating for two people is extremely cramped and you can hear other peoples conversations who are seated right next to you about 2 feet away.  Food is good. For the price, I'd say value is pretty good. Service is terrible. The waitress did not ask if we needed anything during the meal because they did not show up during the meal. Glasses were not refilled during the entire time we were there. They were, however, over by us multiple times but simply ignoring us or did not think about us. Either way, not good. Wait is unwarranted. If wait staff didn't waste time with checks and not spending 10 minutes to bring the check, and then it needing to be separated (why don't you ask?). I saw it took about 15 minutes to empty and clean the table that was empty next to us when we got there. That no doubt is a big reason why turnaround and seating is so slow.  Overall, wait isn't worth it. Food is okay, service is terrible. I'd skip this place."
Brandi D.,"Bloomfield Hills, MI",0,22,1,2.0,9/13/2013,"I  don't  know  if my  experience was because of  Friday the 13th,  but  here it  goes.  Waitress...  I  joined my party late due to overall poor traffic,  but  our waitress went nameless because she  never actually  introduced herself to the party at the  table nor on my arrival.  I  did ask about the wines,  but  beyond a  general description of the  type,  there was no help in differentiation between flavors  during bottling.  This is forgivable,  I'm not at a  wine tasting-- okay.  However,  we never heard anything from the waitress for anything--  not  to see if there was any  issue with any of the food,  late arrivals were pressured to order because she  never gave them a  chance to look over the menu and she didn't even come prepared with a  dessert menu.  I  find it interesting she  stared  at us while looking over the menu,  but never actually checked in while eating.  Actually,  the early arrivals to our party find the waitress generally short  with them as well.  I  know this is a  new location,  super busy,  and  waitresses don't have an  easy job,  but I  do expect the  basics  of a  decent  dining experience-- a  verbally  pleasant  demeanor  and a  check in to gauge  customer satisfaction. I  wonder if her treatment of us has anything to do with the 18%  gratuity tracked onto our bill?   Interesting  theory,  right?    Onto the food... I  requested the herb crusted salmon with lemon  sauce,  asparagus,  and  mashed potatoes.  To put out lightly, I  was underwhelmed. Typically lemon  sauces  are on salmon,  but not this time.  Actually,  everything else but the  salmon touched the  lemon sauce.  The lemon sauce was the  base of the  dish,  my potatoes sat in the  center of the  sauce,  asparagus  under the potatoes and  the salmon was off to the side.  I'll say I  was lucky,  something about the  lemon sauce is all wrong. I  love lemons!  It's just,  this sauce was too much of it and it took on a  very strong flavor,  maybe  an extract?  Honestly,  it just wasn't good and  overpowered anything else on the  dish. I  really don't understand why my  mashed potatoes were in the  dead center of the ladled,  lemon slick.   The  potatoes were a  bit too peppery and  the potstickers (appetizer)  had a  glaze that was too salty.  The asparagus was decent,  the  salmon  was good. Though, I  doubt I'll be recommending this location for any meal.  My dining  buddies were  rather underwhelmed as well. Dessert  After we requested menus,  that went  well.   There's promise there, "" The  Cheesecake  Factory""  makes sense.  Finally... If  for whatever reason a  diner  isn't into their  meal,  the right member of wait staff will make you want to  return.  Unfortunately,  this  isn't the  case here.  Darn that  automatic gratuity,  because our waitress was on her way to a 10%  tip ( and that's just out of obligation,  not because she really deserved it).  Also, I know the  dish turnover is high,  but we had  dirty  flatware,  questionable substances in/on  our water  mugs (which are plastic),  and  there were some fruit flies around.  We finally found out the waitress'  name (Anne K., I  highly doubt she'll be up for any service awards anytime soon,  unless it was just a  bad day).  Though, after the fact,  reading tips on foursquare aptly  pegged service as an  issue and  is substandard when compared to other locations.  That's too bad, I  wanted this to work  out.  Suggestions: - Service is  key to great customer experience!  Novelty will wear off and  customer satisfaction will be down if all waitstaff  is like Anne K.  everyday.   -Cleanliness!  Bugs are everywhere,  especially in restaurants,  but customers don't like to see them.  We  also don't like  needing to send back  cups/glasses/plates/flateware  because food is baked onto them.  It's an awkward situation,  we want to know these things are cleaned,  don't want to be a  bother to  the waiter,  but really want to  know there are  quality standards and  someone cares  about what were issued. -Food!  Maybe  someone  likes the detergent-like  notes my  lemon sauce took on,  maybe it was a  bad  batch,  or  maybe  the  sauce wasn't  sampled  prior to leaving the kitchen.  Hell,  maybe Gordon Ramsay  and other restaurants have my  expectations too  high!  Still,  something was left to  be desired with the citrus- based  sauces,  because my  orange chicken ordering  buddy felt the  same way.  Like I said,  the dessert was good.  Thanks for the  experience,  I'll try again elsewhere"
Z T.,"Shelby charter Township, MI",21,97,285,4.0,3/1/2014,"So we decided to go here on a Saturday at 5pm.  Given that its fairly new to the area, we expected to wait.  When we arrived we were quoted a 2-3 hour wait.  Given that this location is at a mall, we put our name in and went shopping.  We were finally seated at about 8:45.  I was shocked to see people were still coming in the door at this point.  they were still quoting abut a 2hr wait.  Needless to say, the wait was worth it.  Their menu is pretty extensive so there is something everyone.  I had the personal pizza.  It was surprisingly good. We ordered some dessert to go as well.  We will probably go back once the hype dies down and the wait time is more reasonable."
Brian K.,"Novi, MI",30,89,5,2.0,3/19/2014,"Just went here for the 3rd time and I have to say the server was great, but the manager was terrible. I ordered fried chicken with mashed potatoes, biscuits and gravy. The meal arrived with no fried chicken, but with chicken sprinkled with bread crumbs and butter. When I asked the server for fried chicken as it was listed on the menu, she said that's how it comes and she can check with her manager to get me fried chicken tenders instead. she came back and told me her manager said they cannot do that and that's how the chicken comes prepared. No effort whatsoever to please the customer or offer something else. Terrible management. This has been our third time at this location with a bad experience. Chicagoland locations have exceptional service, food, shorter wait times."
Christopher P.,"Hoboken, NJ",0,9,,1.0,9/21/2013,Don't even waste your time going. They have the capacity to seat 300 but only seat small groups so you can stand in line to draw attention because it's new. It's part if the marketing plan.
Staynshape 4.,"Novi, MI",0,7,1,2.0,10/7/2013,"I've been a frequent visitor  of CCF since 1990. From West Coast to Midwest to the Southeast, I've always had great experiences.  THIS LOCATION IS NOT UP TO STANDARDS  OF ALL OTHER NATIONWIDE CCF LOCATIONS. The bar staff was overworked and their menu skills need polishing.  The servers approached us with our food at the bar expecting to hand it to us rather than set it down.  Completely inept training overall.  I'll spare the other blah, blah details as most wont be interested. Instead, I shall  address my detailed displeasure of my visit  in a corporate correspondence.   I live a mile away, hoping the kinks would be worked out by October 6. Not a chance."
Wynee W.,"Novi, MI",19,2,,5.0,9/11/2013,"My boyfriend and I got there at 10:45am last Friday and there was already a small line forming since the restaurant opens at 11am. The manager kept us entertained while the guests were taken to the tables and we only waited for 20 minutes from the time we got there!!! The avocado egg rolls are great for an appetizer. It was crisp, smooth and the sauce that was served with them was an absolute delight! The portion sizes for main entrees were huge! I had to take most of my meal home since I must save room for dessert. We ended up getting the oreo dream extreme cheesecake and the red velvet cheesecake, and I must say, they were the best cheesecakes I have ever had!"
Jackie S.,"Rochester, MI",89,15,2,1.0,12/14/2014,"cheesecake Factory deserves a big negative critique today. i was told to show up 2 hours early for a party of 11 today. i showed up at 11am for a 1pm table. when i got there they told me it would be a 4-5 hour wait. i did exactly as they said and then they changed their wait time to 4-5 hours. who in the sam's hell waits 4-5 for anything let alone food. after much complaining they changed to a 2-3 hour wait time. so we went shopping and i had to navigate a party of 11. some had to drop out because of this and others had to spend more time than they should have. the food was not great. burgers were sub par, fish tacos had no flavor and fish and chips were greasy. a few people had good food but nothing was worth that wait. they treated me like i was crazy and this is just the way it is there and i should accept it. now on a good note the red velvet cheesecake was awesome AND we had an amazing time with our family and friends."
Katie D.,"Hillsborough Township, NJ",0,8,1,5.0,8/13/2013,"The staff is awesome, and the General manager Chris is amazing! You can never beat The Cheesecake Factory! I'm so happy it has FINALLY come to Michigan"
Frederick R.,"Madison Heights, MI",1,43,,2.0,9/6/2013,OK.  So I have not been to this particular Cheesecake factory but I do have a complaint.  The owners of this business are from Michigan and it took them an incredibly long time to bring the business to Michigan.  I will not go to this Cheesecake Factory.
Donne B.,"Northville, MI",19,56,2,5.0,8/16/2013,Bit of a wait but it was to be expected on opening weekend. Good decor even better service for being pack and great food
Amy P.,"Washington, MI",38,132,2,3.0,1/17/2014,"Recently visited this place with some friends. I was quite pumped. We arrived and the wait was quoted as 2-2.5 hours. No problem, the place is attached to a mall how bad can that be. So the hostess told me to come back an hour later for a pager. So I did and received my pager. I asked how far the pager works and she stated down the hall to the information desk. Really? So that means I was confined to this hallway for the next 1-1.5 hours?!?!?! With our technology these days I feel like there could be a better system so people could at least walk around the mall and when a party was about 30 minutes from being sat maybe they could send a text or something to return for a pager. It would be much more enticing to stay.  However I've wanted to try this newest Factory location for a while and being in the company of good friends made the wait easier. We waited the full 2.5 hours if not about 15 minutes more. Our service was ok. It was obvious our waitress was busy as some things took a little long but that's to be understood. We ordered the polenta fries to start. We debated getting two for the table but decided just for one, but our waitress must have misunderstood as the food runner brought two orders. When we told her we only wanted one she started arguing with us stating that the check definitely said 2 and that we definitely wanted 2 orders. Um what? Ok. So we told her we debated getting two but decided on 1 and was going to get another app instead. She proceeded to say that she definitely looked at the check twice and there was definitely 2 rung in which means we definitely ordered 2. Whatever, clearly we weren't getting anywhere with her so we just told our waitress who made no big deal about it, took 1 back and said it was her mistake and we put in for the tomato and mozzerella flatbread. The apps were decent. The polenta fries were really good, soft and pillowy on the inside, a nice crunch on the outside, and the marinara was delicious and a perfect compliment to the polenta.  The flatbread was ok. The tomatoes not being in season lacked flavor, but the basil and the rest of it was tasty. I don't think I'd get that again. Being it was my first visit to this location, and some years since visiting the Chicago location I ordered the Chicken Madeira on our waitresses recommendation. It was served with a nice helping of mashed potatoes on the side. The mashed potatoes had great flavor, but being a former waitress myself, I knew my entree sat in the window for a hot minute because there was a crunch on top of them from sitting under a heat lamp. The chicken itself was tender and tasty, but I'm torn on the sauce. It was very very sweet. A little spice or even some fresh black pepper could have gone a long way. It was maybe just a little too sweet for my liking, but it wasn't bad or anything. Very much like a sweet marsala sauce. The cheese was definitely a nice touch.  The rest of the party seemed to enjoy their dishes. They each got a pasta dish and had no real complaints.  For desert we of course got cheesecake. I'm pretty traditional when it comes to cheesecake, I like it plain so I can enjoy the pure goodness of the cheesecake. The cheesecake itself was delicious, light and pillowy but full of cheesecake flavor. Of course the crust has to be as good as the cheesecake part of it, and this one lacked a little. There wasn't a lot of it and I like a lot of crust. One of my fellow diners ordered a Macademia nut cheesecake and that one was heaven in a cheesecake. You still maintained the originality of a cheesecake with some macademia nuts inside, but the crust was simply amazing. It was a blondie butter brown sugar type crust, but it was thick and gooey and absolutely amazing. I would definitely recommend that cheesecake for sure. Overall I would return and try some different items. I'd probably return on a weekday because I wouldn't wait that long again. There is enough menu items to satisfy the pickiest eater."
Jason L.,"Livonia, MI",1,9,,2.0,8/28/2013,"Simply put, stay away till they get the kinks out.  The good: server was nice and food tasted good. The bad: They were out of the appetizer we ordered, the entrées took 50 min, one entrée was cold and had to be sent back to be reheated & the other slightly warm and finally, this is no exaggeration, we ordered one slice of plain cheese cake to go and after 25 min we had to ask a manager to please grab it so we could leave.  Returned home 15 min later to find the center totally frozen. What a mess....."
Laura F.,"Westland, MI",2,73,9,2.0,11/4/2013,I had the chicken piccata today and it was the blandest piccata I have ever had!!! I had to salt the crap out of it to just have some sort of taste. For the time we waited(yes I know it's new and packed all the time) I would of went somewhere else with cheaper prices and better taste!
Kenan M.,"Farmington Hills, MI",0,8,1,1.0,12/12/2014,"So our evening at the Cheesecake Factory started off with having a wait of 60-85 minutes. After waiting 30 minutes there was seat at the bar, so we decided to sit there. When we ordered our drinks, one of the drinks was a jack Daniels and ginger ale. After receiving that drink, we realized that it was served in a warm glass, which melted the ice and made it watered down and not tasteful.  So we ordered another shot which made this a $14 beverage. Then we ordered the hot spinach and cheese dip which felt and tasted like eating microwaved frozen spinach you find in a grocery store. For our entrees the mashed potatoes were extremely bland and watery. Then the amount of chicken in the pasta, was a minuscule portion. On top of all of this, the three people tending the bar never came over to ask how our meal was. As far as the food goes, my thought is that management is taking their ""turn & burn"" policy, and implementing it in the kitchen. Which would be why the food being prepared and served, is at a low quality. Needless to say, with the 30 minute wait and $115 bill, we will never be returning to this establishment."
Charlene E.,"Bloomfield Hills, MI",0,24,24,1.0,2/20/2015,"I had some out of town guest and took them to Ceesecake Factory Friday night.  In the parking lot there were no parking spaces.  Valet had a line that was very long because they had only one guy parking cars.  Get inside restaurant and get up to counter from standing in a long line and was told I had a 2 1/2 hour wait.  While waiting with my guest, two grandchildren were added to the party (not in the plan) so when we finally got in they told us that if we wanted to add the two grandkids we would have to wait 1 1/2 hours longer.  So half of my party left the restaurant. Then they say us in a booth near the front entrance with all the cold from the fridge winds outside blew in on us all night. The place don't have any concept of customer service. The waitress was very condescending until I informed her that I will write a letter to corporate. Oh that was not s threat ... It's a promise! Needless to say, I don't care if they were serving honey dew dripping in pure gold I will never cross that threshold again."
Nicholas A.,"Northville, MI",84,67,20,3.0,1/13/2014,"This place definitely has some good food and some of the best cheesecake I have ever had.  I do not think it is worth the wait though.  Every time I head to 12 oaks I notice that the line is out the door and in the summer around the building outside, this just blows my mind! If I was just rating the cheesecake it would get a 5 star easy, the food a 4 star and because of everything else this restaurant brings with it, I gave it 3.  I guess if you have nothing else to do and you love waiting around then head to The Cheesecake Factory!"
Scott M.,"Northville, MI",0,1,,2.0,8/27/2014,"Very long wait for food after being seated during non-rush period, and it came out ice cold. Still waiting for replacement meal after entire family has finished eating. Have never written a review before, but had plenty if time to set up a yelp account and write review (first ever). Next time, going to CPK right across the hall."
Robin S.,"Canton, MI",4,64,9,5.0,9/9/2013,Best Cheese cake; especially velvet!  I had in Vegas location to take out.  I don't want to await for 3 hours...  Perhaps take out is the best solution! :)
