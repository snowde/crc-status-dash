Daron D.,"Ypsilanti Township, MI",53,379,68,4.0,9/20/2013,"Came here on a Friday at noon exactly and had about a 40 minute wait, which wasn't bad at all. Once we got seated, it was eating time. For starters we had their spinach and artichoke dip, which was OK, nothing great (chips were great and it also come with pico de gallo and sour cream on the side). For my meal i had the Cajun jambalaya pasta, which was great along with the fries, which was also great. All the food items here come in really large portions (even the lunch size portions are big) and you are almost guaranteed to take something home. Of course a trip to the cheesecake factory would not be complete with cheesecake. For my selection, i went with the lemon raspberry and its was really really good, a must try in my opinion. Overall, this is my third different cheesecake factory behind Pittsburgh and Chicago, and once you been to one, you have been to them all and this one is just as good as the rest."
Jennifer A.,"Commerce Township, MI",2,2,,1.0,1/25/2014,Put in reservation and was told 2.5 -3 hours so we went and walked around the mall for 2.5 hours only to return to them saying they already called our table an hour prior.  After this we were told it would be another hour for a table. They were not at all apologetic and acted as if it was my fault. People should not be expected to stand around (limited seating for waiting) just in case your table is called early. Maybe they should try texting people when there table is ready. I have heard many stories of this same thing happening. It makes good business for the nearby restaurants.
Jim J.,"Novi, MI",2,16,11,3.0,4/15/2014,Ordered a carry out cause I didn't want to wait 3 hrs for dinner and still I had to wait a hr just to pick up my order. staff was unfriendly and it didn't seem like there was any one in charge it was complete chaos this place will be nicer  to dine at if it wasn't so busy
Amanda R.,"West Bloomfield Township, MI",27,51,2,3.0,8/29/2013,"This review is for dine in 8/23/13- Arrived here at 1pm with my parents and was told a 30 minute wait. No big deal until we see everyone being seated except us and then it became a 45 minute wait.. My mom then asked the last at the front desk what the deal was and she was rude and her reply was literally ""45 minutes is a short wait."" Now, if she didn't have an ugly tone while speaking to us or would have said about an hour of a wait OK no problem. Also, I'm not racist, but we were the only white people in line for this amount of time and all the black people were seated very promptly...and the staff at the front desk was black. I don't care who you are, everyone still plays that stupid race card.  Anyway, we end up sitting at the bar now because they can't even tell us when a table would be ready.. Whatever no big deal... Until we sit at a table in the bar section for another 25-30 minutes with no waiter/waitress arriving.. We went to the actual bar to get our own drinks. How sad is that? Then the waitress wanted to say we weren't there for that long and I was really irritated my parents were being treated badly so I looked at her and simply stated ""Yes. We have."" Oh, but the African American party of 6 right behind us in the bar area were taken care of like they were GOLD. I had to ask for a water when our waitress finally arrived..which never came until AFTER my entree but she also took care of that other table and they had everything they ever needed. Was NOT a good experience. This review is for take out-- I happen to work in a salon close to CF so I thought since a client told me their carry out is about a 30 minute wait that I could order our food and pick it up on my way home from work. Guess what? I did.. But maybe it wasn't what I was expecting since the last time I ate CF was when I was 15, maybe? My BF has never had it and we absolutely are disappointed with the type of crowd there so no chance would we wait in line for something so close to home. Called in the order which was not as bad as I thought. It was VERY loud in there, but the lady who took my order kept apologizing and was very calm and repeated my order not once, but twice, to make sure she heard correctly. Thanks! Went inside to pick it up and there is no designated line to pay for carry out orders and it was literally a jungle. No one had any idea what they were doing (patrons), but that IS the staff's responsibility. It was executed very, very poorly. So bad in fact that I had to push my way to get to the register. Even then there were still people being obnoxious and cutting, or trying to re-order more cheesecake. Anyway, on to the food. I ordered the bang bang chicken and shrimp for the BF. My first initial thought was ""wow, that's an awfully small portion size."" It was sort of sad of how small it was because they ARE known for large plates. I could have easily eaten the entire entree myself. It was small enough that I actually had to share my salad with him. Although, flavor was right on. For myself I had the Chinese salad with their pomegranate vinegarette. It was giant. We didnt even put a dent in it. It was absolutely delicious and would get it again. Vietnamese summer shrimp spring rolls: decent, but the rice paper was sort of hard and way too chewy. I have lived with Vietnamese people and this is not what a rice paper roll is supposed to be the texture of. Good flavor, but that and the fact they give you three is a bit disappointing for what you get with the price you pay. Cheesecake: Red Velvet- Good, but I can always taste sugar in whatever I eat so I barely touched any. My Bf says its the best cheesecake he's had because it is more of a ""cake.""  Chris' outrageous- I LOVe coconut, but this just didnt do much. It was so sugary and fake coconut tasting.:( Overall, I'll go back when the hype does down in the middle of winter when not a sole wants to drive an hour in a blizzard. Thanks :)"
Mario J.,"Dearborn, MI",3,115,24,3.0,10/6/2013,Pretty good place and worth going to. Floors were kinda slippery and greesy feeling but still good but not great experience.
Samantha R.,"Las Vegas, NV",79,69,93,5.0,10/17/2013,"Wonderful food, wonderful alcoholic beverages and wonderful dessert. I got the salmon and I must say it was one of the best I ever had, the flavor was simple and fresh and cooked to perfection. The potatoes that came with it were to die for! Also, one of the only resturaunts with an extensive gluten free menu (almost impossible to find) ... We waited almost 2 hours which typically would be a downfall but it was worth every second. Delicious & perfect! Love!"
K K.,"West Bloomfield Township, MI",0,25,,4.0,4/11/2015,"Including this location, I've dined at four Cheesecake Factory restaurants. Unfortunately, the Novi location is the smallest and least aesthetically pleasing. To perhaps ease crowding, I hope other CF restaurants will open in Michigan because an hour wait every visit is tiresome! With that said, the bar service has been prompt and friendly, and the food is always enjoyable."
Lizzy N.,"Lone Tree, CO",0,44,,5.0,2/17/2014,"LOVE their cheesecake. It's good to see this place in Michigan.  Since the hype has somewhat died down, the wait wasn't too bad.  The portions are HUGE and the menu options are endless. I agree with another posted that the design of the resto is poor.  I'd come back just for dessert.  I love their variety of cheesecakes."
Natalie D.,"Monroe, MI",0,24,,2.0,9/21/2014,"The wait was not terrible. On a Sunday at 5, we waited 30 minutes. Pretty normal, I would say. However, I ordered the strawberry lemonade. It was VERY VERY sour. It tasted terrible. I wasn't sure if it was the strawberry or the lemonade, either way I puckered every time I drank it. This lemonade costs $4.75. The price was not listed on the menu, nor was presented to me when I was ordering. That was a rip-off, but not the worst part. When I got the Bistro Shrimp Pasta, which comes with spaghetini, the pasta was all stuck together in like 20 strand clumps. I sent it back because it was not done and chewy. While I was waiting, my husbands food was getting cold, so I insisted on him eating, so at least one of us enjoyed our food. Once I got my food, it was okay; not great, but not terrible. Definitely, not worth $17.95 though. They did not offer to comp my meal or anything like that, even though my husband was completely done by the time I got mine. Then we ordered cheesecake, to go. My husband got the white chocolate raspberry cheesecake. He said it was okay.... I got the strawberry cheesecake. It came with 3 strawberries, they were SOOOO tart. I figured out why my strawberry lemonade was so terrible. For all of that, we spent $65. That was a HUGE waste. The place does not have good enough food for me to spend $65. I will not be returning, EVER. It is not worth the drive or the money, that is for sure."
Nate C.,"Westland, MI",2,22,4,1.0,5/23/2015,"They should just stick to making cheese cake. Unlike most people our wait was not bad, service and food was awful. My fiancé and I went to Cheesecake Factory for the first time last night, we've had their cheesecake before at another location and decided to go here for dinner and dessert as it was our anniversary. We arrived at 730 on a Thursday night, and only had to wait 10 min to be seated outdoors. Our server took 10min to bring us water, then he took our order at 745, and dropped off bread at 750. At 830 the food runner dropped off our food. I had a burger and she had alfredo. (Side note, one of the food runners that took food to the table next to us had bleeding cuts or burns on his hands, and was bare handed touching plates and food!) She said her food was barely warm, and mine was over cooked and my fries tasted like they cooked them directly in a batch of fish. After about 10 min of waiting for our server, I decided to just eat my charcoal burger and fish fries. Around 850 our server showed back up and asked if we needed anything, I asked him for our bill and a cheesecake menu. At 905 he brought the cheesecake menu and left. At 915 he came back and took our dessert order. At 925 he brought our bill. At 930 he came back to ask if we wanted boxes for our dinner, and took our bill and payment. At 940 he came back with our cheesecake and said rudely ""umm did you want that change?"" ARE YOU SERIOUS yeah you should give me my change, do you really think you automatically get a $10 tip. I would have left it for him because we always tip 20% but if service is outstanding we'll do 30%+. With our cheesecake slices one was on its side and smashed up. I felt the service was terrible and slow, and the food was similar to a run down coney island. On top of that I think we got food poisoning. We will NEVER go to cheesecake factory to eat again!"
Christy C.,"Livonia, MI",0,19,,1.0,5/9/2015,"Ridiculously busy. It was built way too small. Multiple times I've tried to go here, both at peak and non-peak times, since the restaurant opened a year or two ago. The wait is always at least 2 hours, and I just trucked my extended family out here to discover they don't guarantee that parties any larger than 6 will be seated together. They split you up into two parties of four. And they don't take reservations. I've been able to eat at their restaurant in Chicago much more quickly."
Valerie J.,"Novi, MI",0,25,2,4.0,4/28/2015,"Great food, great staff. Fast service. Great bread for starters. Only downside is a 3 hour wait during the weekends.  CPK is where all the Cheesecake Factory rejects go!"
Heather C.,"St Clair Shores, MI",0,7,,3.0,8/27/2013,"The food is good, but we were told our wait for 2 people would be 75-90 minutes. This turned into a 2.5 hr wait, once seated it took another 10 minutes to get our order in. The manager was nice and comped is an appetizer, but come on, your wait staff needs to learn how to turn tables!"
Matthew M.,"Toronto, Canada",7,95,2,4.0,1/10/2014,It was nice seeing this establishment return to its hometown. Detroit will NEVER die. Everything on the menu is awesome here..selections for everyone and the bread that comes to the table is to die for. Waits up to 5 hours tho so be prepared to wait!
Rachel S.,"Warren, MI",19,65,18,3.0,12/9/2013,"The wait here is horrendous - I was willing to wait an hour and a half to try this place for the first time. Once you're seated you'll wait awhile longer and they first bring out a bread basket with both rye and sourdough bread with butter - just give me my damn cheesecake! At first I thought that the food was really over priced but then I (finally!) received my entree and realized that the portion sizes were huge; I can work with this. Overall, I'd rather make dinner and home and buy frozen Cheescake Factory cheescake from the grocery store than wait."
T D.,"Farmington, MI",0,12,8,5.0,1/20/2014,"Finally Cheesecake Factory in Michigan !!! Loved it. Crispy Fried Cheese, Veggie burger are delicious and my favorite. Absolutely worth the wait. On a weekday the wait time is approx. 45 minutes to an hour. For weekends it is around 2 hours."
Lisa R.,"Plymouth, MI",4,28,1,1.0,4/17/2014,"Seriously disappointing. Still confused on why there's a 2 hour wait on WEEKNIGHTS and 3 hours on weekends.. First time I went the Caesar salad was great, 2nd time it was DRENCHED in dressing. Mac and cheese bites are usually good (in other states) but came out way less than hot. By the time the waitress came back it was 10 minutes to even let her know. Overpriced & overrated. Staff are not friendly and take forever to tend to you. Won't be coming back."
Leslee B.,"Farmington, MI",0,13,1,2.0,12/6/2015,"If I was grading on the flavor, quality and quantity of the food only then I give them a 5!  However I give a ZERO for the bar staff therefore a TWO!  I've decided not to name the two and even a third employee because I personally let them know that the quality of their service was horrible and therefore deserved no tip at all. Maybe they will think twice about acknowledging the hard working customers that come in. Even though they both made sarcastic comments when called out in their poor service. Respect the fact that I earn my money and I'm not just going to hand it out to you based on 20% of my bill when you have provided the worst service of the year. I called the mgr, Brandon, but after enough time holding the phone was disconnected and I choose not to waste anymore more time on this experience. I did indicate ""horrible service"" on my receipt and I will not be back. The service at the West Palm Beach, FL location puts the Novi, MI location to shame."
Chelsea C.,"South Lyon, MI",81,51,36,4.0,10/29/2014,"I expected a long wait.  They said 50 minutes and we only waited about 30 so can't complain, there used to be a 3 hour wait.  I only wish they had more seating for people waiting it's crowded because it's also where people line up to buy to-go cheesecake. I have had several different dishes and they are always amazing. The appetizers are great,  the bread is great. The staff are friendly.  The music is too loud though which makes people talk louder. It's a great place for a date or a family get together!  Love it!"
Pamela L.,"Clawson, MI",0,4,,2.0,1/19/2016,"Before you even get to the food, you need to get past the 1 1/2 hour minimum wait.   They really don't have a waiting area and their beepers only work inside the restaurant so you have to wait inside and with 20 other people.  You can't get a drink while you wait because the bar is full and the 2 times I was there they only had 1 bartender.   Plan on spending at least 3-4 hours there when you go.  The menu is quite extensive which could be shortened to reduce the time it takes to look through the menu.   I informed the waitress that it was my daughters birthday thinking that maybe she would receive a complimentary piece of cheesecake or appetizer, like most restaurants to, but all she received was a happy birthday.  The waitress did not go out of her way to make anything a little special.   When I received my bill after 3 1/2 hours of being there i asked the waitress if they do anything for birthday and she said oh, yes we do have an ice cream sundae, which we already purchased the cheesecake.  She didn't even care that she neglected to tell us this.   That was the second and the last time I will go to this location, definitely not worth the wait, or the prices."
