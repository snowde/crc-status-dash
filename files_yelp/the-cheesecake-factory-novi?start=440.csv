Becky A.,"Walled Lake, MI",0,1,1,1.0,1/25/2014,"I have been to many other Cheesecake Factory's around the country so I wasn't in a hurry to go here but it was my sister and my dad's birthday and that is where they wanted to go. We got there and we knew we were going to have to wait about 2-3 hours with 10 people. So the wait was 2.5-3 hours. They told us to come back and get a pager in about an hour so we did. When I got the pager we were told ""at least an hour and 40 minutes"". OK no big deal. So we walked around the mall and came back right at the 2.5 hour mark. The manager had told my sister he had been paging us for a half hour and that there were no tables available and that it would be another hour.  There management staff was not even sorry or accommodating. They didn't even try to fit us in. This is not the first time I have heard of them doing this. They had horrible customer service!!! I will never go back to this one!!!!!"
Nicole K.,"Farmington, MI",1,8,1,3.0,1/10/2015,"The food is phenomenal, as always at any Cheesecake Factory location. The problem with this location is the restaurant is small, meaning there is not a lot of seating like you would expect, which causes long waits. I have been here 4 times now and each time waited anywhere from 1.5 hours to 3 hours just to be seated. And they don't take reservations.  Don't come here if you are hungry, because you can expect at least an hour wait to be seated, and about another hour to get your food. The upside is you can do a little shopping at the mall while you wait to be seated."
Kaylin M.,"Troy, MI",0,3,,3.0,12/2/2014,My group wanted to try Cheesecake Factory because they had never been to one of their other locations. Can say it wasn't bad but it wasn't great. I had the Kobe Burger and it was overcooked. Over cooking will completely ruin a meal for me. I should have got something different but next time I will know if I do return.
Mike M.,"Berkley, MI",0,16,,3.0,7/15/2014,"Cheesecake was good, burger was decent, Caesar salad and side salad also good. Fries were pretty bad, and the service was SLOW. We were there at an off time (4pm on a Tuesday) so this involved no waiting for a table-definitely not worth waiting for-just slow service from the time we were seated on."
A K.,"Northville, MI",0,5,,3.0,9/28/2013,"When we first got there we waited in the carry out line for a good fifteen minutes before they informed us this was the carry out line and the dining room line was at the outside entrance. There really should be signs directing people where to go when there is that many people coming in and out. It is very unclear.The wait was 3-4 hours so we decided to eat somewhere else but get cheesecake to go later. At least this time we knew which line to stand in but of course there were others in line that waited a long time before they were told it was the carry out line... Again, signs are needed. I also think it would be great to have a sign stating the estimated wait times.. So many people waited just to ask that question and there were already so many people standing around. So while waiting to order cheesecake, I noticed an employee with shoulder length black hair bringing cheesecakes out to the fridge. The way she was carrying them, her hair was touching the tops of the cheesecakes! It was absolutely disgustingly. After seeing her come out with more and the same thing happening, I let the manager know. A while later I saw her again .. I would have thought they'd make her put her hair back. I worked in the food industry for many years, your hair has got to pulled back. Gross. Luckily, my cheesecake was already in the display..  I will say the hostesses were very nice given the crazy circumstances. They have to put up with a lot and you can tell they are working hard. It was almost 9 when we got cheesecake and there was still a line out the door. A lot of people were exhibiting frustrations regarding the long wait times and they handled themselves absolutely professionally!! They deserve a raise!  I'll be back but going to wait a few more months until it's not so chaotic."
Sara L.,"Miami Lakes, FL",4,30,4,4.0,6/23/2014,Cheesecake amazing as always. Orange chicken was delicious. i would recommend if you don't want to wait go during the week after 1pm. we didn't have to wait at all. Appetizers and small plates are great.
Brendan B.,"Dowagiac, MI",0,25,,5.0,10/10/2014,"I don't know why there are so many negative reviews, I thought this location was great. I've been to a Cheesecake Factory in Chicago, Denver, and Seattle and I thought this one was just as good. I've always loved their tropical iced tea. We had a few different appetizers and shared them, they were all great. Especially the crispy crab wontons. Hostess was very friendly as was our server. I'll definitely come back here."
Lola T.,"Palm Beach, FL",101,7,,4.0,3/9/2014,"Super long wait - 2+ hours, but the best veggie burger I've ever had, ever. Pretty good sweet potato fries too."
Kristie L.,"Farmington, MI",9,37,,1.0,9/12/2013,"I waited until the hub bub died down from grand opening.  What a disappointment.  I waited 20 mins at lunch hour which was not bad.  The first bad thing was noticing all the other tables get bread baskets while the one next to mine and I didn't (same waitress).  I got my appetizer pretty quick which was warm asparagus salad.  Good. Finished in 5 mins.  Then waited 40 mins for entree.  She apparently forgot to place it or something while she gave next table theirs within 15 mins.  When they were done, they asked me how I liked my meal.  I said I still haven't gotten it and they were aghast.  So they comped the entree which was terrible anyways. Chicken salad sandwich.  No raisins or almonds or honey in it.  Then the dessert.  I asked for chocolate raspberry.   I got the cheesecake.  Mentioned to other table I couldn't taste raspberry.  The woman, a cheesecake factory veteran said u are missing the raspberry puree on top.   She told waitress who brought it out.  Then the bill came showing I was charged for sauce and revealed what I had gotten was chocolate truffle cheesecake!  No wonder.   Sigh.  2 hours wasted on that meal.   I was so unhappy.  The next table told me not to tip and said I got terrible service which I agreed.  I still left a 5% tip tho"
Christopher P.,"Detroit, MI",2,57,4,2.0,9/29/2013,"My wife and I went here a couple weeks ago on a Friday evening to celebrate our birthdays which are a week apart.  Anyways, we were both looking forward to a nice dinner.  I have been to other TCF locations, but this was her first venture.  When we got there, we were told two to three hours for a table.  I wasn't surprised, having read the reviews on here.  We eventually got our table after two hours.  The design and layout of the restaurant is really quite beautiful, I'll give it star  for that.  Our food experience left a lot to be desired.  We ordered the Mac & Cheese ball appetizer, which we never received.  The server came up with some lame excuse as to why.  Apparently, there is a lot of coverage by the servers for different tables.  However, on this busy Friday night, there was clearly lack of communication as to who gets what food.  Our entrees were decent, but not worth the wait or the price.  I ordered the Southwest chicken sandwich, my wife had a BBQ chicken salad.  We were both a little disappointed with how they turned out.  For dessert, we had the Snicker bar cheesecake, and this was by far the best part of our dinner.  I'll give it a star for that, and the additional star for design/decor.  All in all, a beautiful dining room, but not worth the wait, sub-par service and miscommunication on the part of the wait staff, mediocre entrees, and world-class cheesecake.  Hopefully it improves going forward.  We won't be returning anytime soon."
Milo G.,"Northville, MI",9,48,14,3.0,11/19/2013,"My friends and I went on a Tuesday afternoon, when the wait is supposed to be shortest... Wrong, we waited for 50 minutes granted they told us the wait might be 30-45 minutes but still it's a little crazy to wait for a chain restaurant with nothing that unique about it. Well to summarize, the food was ok, the portion sizes are enough to feed two  adult men per plate. The service was friendly but slow as humanely possible without annoying anyone. (Maybe because we waited forever to get in, it wore us down) The cheesecake was good I would say, and we tried a lot of different kinds but it wasn't something I need to have again. All in all, the best part were the very overpriced cocktails which were delicious. I would not recommend going out of your way to come here but if you do, be prepared to be there waiting for a table and then for your food from 2-4 hours. Definitely get an overpriced cocktail because trust me, you'll need it."
Sara S.,"West Bloomfield Township, MI",0,8,4,1.0,3/26/2014,"I came here a few months after they first opened. I was excited to try the novi location because ccf is the first place I eat at in Chicago. I get there around lunch time and there's about a 10 min wait. I get to the table and I'm with my mother. All is fine except for the odd waiter that we had. He acted as if he wanted to sit down with us and take a smoke. We get to ordering and I order a Caesar salad and my mom orders a chicken dish. We decided that we also want to try the sweet potato fries so I also order that too. The waiter then proceeds to say ""wait wait wait how does someone order a salad and then order fries, that doesn't work, it's not healthy"" well thanks for killing the mood and ruining lunch. I sat there self conscious and decided that I didn't want to eat after that. He got the vibe after that I was obviously angry and wanted to knock him out. The usual long wait is also ridiculous.  Mcdonalds has better food and service!!!! Definitely not worth a penny or a second of your time."
S M.,"West Bloomfield Township, MI",33,24,,2.0,10/24/2013,"Unbelievably rude greeter.  Rude enough to bring my rating down to 2 stars. When I got to restaurant and put our name to wait to be seated, the , greeter  asked me if we would like to be seated inside, outside, or first available. It was cold outside and windy, so  I said INSIDE please. the greeter told me that would be about a 40 minute wait and I told her that was fine. 40 minutes later we were called and they ask, ""outside is ok right?"" And I firmly said ""NO I waited 40 minutes and I told you INSIDE."" To which snaps back, "" No, You told me first available"" and then smiles a smirk little smile.  I couldn't believe she was telling me what I said, disagreeing with me, basically calling me a liar. I know what I said. I felt like slapping her smug little face. This was enough that  I wouldn't go back just because of this!!!"
Tanya K.,"West Bloomfield Township, MI",0,1,,1.0,10/10/2014,Terrible terrible service. I was ordering carry out  which took way longer then promised. Staff and manager did not  seem to care. I am sorry to say will never give them my business. Will rather go next door to CPK.
Zello A.,"Ann Arbor, MI",0,13,11,5.0,6/15/2014,The servers are always so engaging and polite. The food is delicious and reasonable. The portions are always a great size and the food has never failed to delight. We absolutely love going here!
Kara K.,"Westland, MI",0,6,,1.0,9/15/2013,"I know it's only a month old so going there at dinner time on a Friday night I expected to wait. The hostess said 2 to 2.5 hours. My party wanted to wait so we began to kill time. After 2.5 hours we checked back with the hostess who told us it would be another thirty minutes.  3 hours, wow! That's a long time to wait to eat. We had already invested so much time we stayed. At 3 hours we again checked with hostess who informed us it would be another 40 minutes. That was the limit. No place is worth waiting for four hours to eat. Very disappointed in their customer service.. How do you get a wait time so wrong? We won't be back."
Carl S.,"Commerce Township, MI",0,6,,2.0,9/24/2013,"Been to Cheesecake Factory in other states (Ohio, two in Illinois) and it (was) among my favorite places to eat.  So excited that one is now open five mile from my home - until I went there.  Can't complain about the staff who, but the food - did it come from the California Pizza Kitchen across the way?  It was served to us lukewarm, was dried out and overall VERY lackluster.  Leave it to us (Michigan) to serve up blah food!  I may give it another chance in a few months, but overall I was very disappointed!!!"
Thesa J.,"Farmington Hills, MI",44,334,438,4.0,4/19/2014,"We came here yesterday around 6:30pm and were given a 2 1/2 hour wait time for a table of 6 (understood since we were a larger party). The restaurant is quite small which makes it even a longer wait. There is a small bench for people who are waiting, and a bar you can grab a seat at as well (but it was all full). We decided to wait anyway and were seated around 8:15pm. We were famished by the time we were seated. I unfortunately forgot the name of our waitress, but she was fantastic. She greeted us as soon as we were seated and quickly brought us a round of water , bread, and butter. She also gave great suggestions and offered to answer any questions we had. i ordered the caribbean cooler which was really yummy and refreshing! (one complaint i do have is that the drink was not strong at all- tasted like the bartender forgot to add alcohol to it, and i generally don't like my drinks strong!) For my entree, I decided to go with one of her suggestions, which was the Farfalle Pasta with Chicken and Roasted Garlic, which is a bow tie pasta with chicken, mushrooms, tomato, pancetta, peas, and caramelized onions in a roasted garlic-parmesan cream sauce. I brought up how I wanted to substitute the chicken with shrimp (due to no meat on Fridays during Lent), and she was very accommodating and even informed me of the pancetta (which is bacon), and asked me whether or not I wanted to take it out as well. The pasta was soooo good! I would definitely come back and order it again! After dinner I ordered the Tiramisu Cheesecake and my s/o ordered the red velvet cheesecake. Both were very delicious. I was surprised that the tiramisu cheesecake was very light and fluffy, rather than tasting overly sweet and heavy like most cheesecakes. overall i had a wonderful experience (minus the waiting time). i really do hope that cheesecake factory would consider taking reservations! especially for people who want to have birthday parties who wouldn't want to have to wait an hour + for a table! i think opening up another cheesecake factory within MI would help as well!"
Donna P.,"Livonia, MI",16,7,,2.0,6/15/2015,"Went to Novi, Mi restaurant. Was told 70-90 minute wait. Checked in at 70 minutes and was told it would be 50 more minutes. 50 minutes later was told 25 minutes! Don't go here if you want to eat less than two hours later. Finally had to get a manager, we got sat and also this other gentleman and his family who was sleeping on the only bench in the waiting area. Waitress took his order then ours right after. Their food came and they finished eating. Meanwhile we were still waiting for our food! Oh and they keeped promising my daughter her beverage, a half hour later they comp it but it took another 10 minutes before it appeared. She comp the beverage because she knew how long it was taking. It was her idea. Just under 4 hrs later we finally cashed out. We asked for our dessert to go! They need to get it together!!!! I have waited tables for twenty plus years. This is not how you get repeat customers!"
Ani J.,"Plymouth, MI",0,304,,3.0,1/24/2014,"back again.  tried the veggie burger.  taste great, just way too big and thick.  so thick the middle was not cooked, hope there wasn't raw egg in it. fyi-don't think any vegetarian likes burgers gigantic like meatlovers do.  something thinner and less messy that will fit and stay on the bun.  again, ate it with a fork and knife; truly not my ideal of a sandwich. and again love those fries. hubby got the chile relleno burger and he said it was the best burger he has had in a long time.  but too tall with the real chile relleno (stuffed w/ cheese) it was too tall to eat with hands-needed that fork and knife. service again great! did not have room for cheesecake."
