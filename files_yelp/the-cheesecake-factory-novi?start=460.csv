Juniper C.,"Dearborn, MI",1,8,,3.0,1/22/2014,"Horrible waiting, you average wait time is going to be 40+ minutes. Yes it's amazing. Food is consistent but service isn't at all. Sometimes you'll get a attentive server, and other times not at all. It's a decent chain (not something you'll get a lot unfortunately) with a wide variety of flavors and cooking fusions, i'd say give this location a go and you probably for the better will like it."
Valerie O.,"West Bloomfield Township, MI",4,16,4,2.0,1/2/2014,"I was very disappointed in this Cheesecake Factory location. I am a frequent visitor of this franchise in Chicago, Las Vegas, and San Diego, but Novi was not comparable. I visited the restaurant on a Wednesday night back in November and waited about 45 minutes which was much less than expected. I expected the food to be better especially because the establishment had been open about 3 months prior.  First, they were very busy with one single waitress waiting on all the tables in the area, who was extremely rude. The menus itself were seriously gross-they were very greasy so I automatically felt dirty and disgusting eating in there. We ordered sliders as apps, an ahi tuna roll, and fried shrimp (dynamite shrimp) i believe it is called. The sliders were tasteless, the tuna roll was okay but nothing amazing, and the dynamite shrimp tasted like fried batter. We also asked for fresh bread because the first time it came out it was not good or fresh. When we got the ""new"" batch it was just as cold and I could tell it was old because it was just so flaky and dry. We also ordered a fresh strawberry cheesecake which was really good (as it should be). I am very disappointed but will likely return to try again to see if they have improved."
World T.,"Dallas, TX",0,3,,1.0,10/5/2013,"Terrible customer service, Waited for hours and the staff were not accurate about waiting time. Not attentive to customer needs and manager is useless"
Dan S.,"Plymouth, MI",0,12,,4.0,6/25/2014,"Having gone with a party of 20, I can't attest to service for smaller parties.  Despite not taking reservations, our party's wait time for a weekday lunch was quite short - although we were first in line so that always helps. Service was very friendly and exceptionally well-organized for such a large party. The wait time for the food was a bit long but not abnormal for 20 dishes.  Lunch itself was very good - not fine dining but solid (and better than some ""fine dining"" establishments).  The cheesecake was amazing.  Lunch took 2.5 hours but included a dessert course.  Overall a good experience if you have a little extra time to enjoy good company."
Emily G.,"Detroit, MI",0,1,,5.0,10/7/2013,"People crack me up. There's no way the cheesecake was half the size of other cheesecake factories..... as all of the cheesecakes come from the same place, (the factory) pre-cut. As long as there's always something to complain about.....lol"
Katie F.,"Walled Lake, MI",5,76,12,5.0,4/16/2014,"I'm basically obsessed with the CF. I love cheesecake, but the food, I think is actually even better than the desert. I have had a few kinds of cc here that were a little too much, but in general, delicious. They are not cheap and it's the only CF in MI so be prepared to wait. The service is not wonderful bc of the size of the restaurant but they do give you bread to tided you over. I recommend the Crispy Chicken Costaleta? I think it's called- the Stuffed Chicken Tortillas are really good too."
Anonymous A.,"Ferndale, MI",0,37,,1.0,11/12/2013,"When our ""35 minute wait"" turned into over 2 hours and got extended yet again, we just left. I know that restraunt managers are educated and well-paid to estimate wait times. Unacceptable."
Jerry M.,"Ypsilanti, MI",88,53,5,4.0,10/12/2013,"My wife and I went here for our anniversary.  There are lots of positives for this chain restaurant. The menu is huge and for the most part everything we had were delicious and huge. We had two small plates, white bean humus and fried polenta. Oh my,  you must try the fried polenta. It's creamy like a mozzarella stick but a little nuttier with a great tomato sauce. The humus was just ok and I probably wouldn't get it again. At this point we were already pretty full but my meal was just as delicious and I had left overs for two days.   Don't forget the cheesecake. I live peanut butter and I love it with cheesecake. I think they probably have 25 different cakes. I probably won't ever try them all but I sure would like to try.   The wait isn't worth 4 hours if you are in a large party.  We only had two of us and were sat within an hour fifteen.  It wasn't even that bad because they said we could going to the mall as long as we were back within 30 minutes before they said."
Lou J.,"Commerce Township, MI",0,6,,2.0,11/1/2013,"We went on a Wednesday at 3:30 and were seated immediately.Food was presented well and tasted good. Now for the bad...Our silverware was dirty with food specks, table was not clean and it took twelve minutes for anyone to greet us and take our drink order. One thing that was an odd contradiction was server took our napkins and placed them on our laps but our waters were in old plastic beer mugs.? Our server(in his late twenties) kept remarking how my seventeen year old daughter was so pretty.CREEPY. Then the food runner and bus boy approached us with the same comment.We felt uncomfortable and couldnt wait to leave. I thought this was a fancy place. We received the service and professionalism of a local bar but at three times the price. tip; request a booth when putting in your name for seating.But if you are a ""people person"" and dont mind touching elbows with the table next to you then accept first available."
Jen S.,"Canton, MI",2,38,,3.0,12/31/2013,"We waited an hour and a half. Our waitress was great, very kind and nice. The food was just ""ok"". I think it is way over priced for the quality. Someone in my group got a medium steak and it was beyond well done and burnt and charred. I ordered pulled pork and a salad, which was good. It took about. 30 minutes for the food-fine. However, afterwards 2 of us ordered cheesecake and 1 ordered just a scoop of ice cream with just some chocolate syrup. One cheesecake came out about 30 minutes, the other about 40 minutes. About 45 minutes after ordering the dessert, the waitress comes back and says they have to ""find"" more ice cream at which point we cancelled the ice cream order. That was truly ridiculous. The bill was $90 for 3 sodas, 3 meals and 2 cheesecakes. The cheesecake however was excellent :)"
Bashar J.,"Northville, MI",0,5,1,5.0,3/21/2014,Awesome resturant. Finally opens in Michigan. There Cheesecake is probably the best in America. A lot of food choices and great appetizers. Good service. Awesome place.
Kiara T.,"Detroit, MI",0,3,,3.0,3/5/2014,"As excited as I was for The Cheesecake Factory to come to Novi. I am not ok with the location. Its within a mall and not big as the Las Vegas, Chicago and the other locations. It should have been in the Fountain Walk area or the Grand River/Novi Rd area. It would've helped with wait time and size of the restaurant."
Paul C.,"Birmingham, MI",0,19,,3.0,12/15/2013,"carryout pasta is yuck so only dine in.  But, the wait is too long and they are too arrogant.  It's too expensive too.  If someone is paying the hot, fresh pasta is good but fattening and the cheese cake very, very expensive but very good tasting with a lot of variety of flavors."
Toya K.,"Redford Charter Township, MI",0,10,1,2.0,9/12/2014,It was my girlfriends 27th birthday and she wanted to try the Cheesecake Factory. She called about reservations 2 weeks before the date just to be sure that we had everything in line but was told they don't do reservations but that we just need to come and expect to wait at least 3 hours. Well she really wanted to eat there so she got there and was given a buzzer & was told to keep checking on the wait time every 40 min. The problem was that when we got down to the 25min interval and went to the desk to be seated we were then told that the wait was another hour! Like who does that! We were getting ready to leave after standing around another 30 minutes trying to figure out what the what!  Then all of a sudden we were walking on a slippery SLIPPERY floor getting seating as we were just about to leave. The food was ok and the portions were petite. The cake was not what we expected as it was not like the best I've had.
