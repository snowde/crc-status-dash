Jen R.,"Sterling Heights, MI",7,13,11,1.0,1/7/2017,"Only order a cheesecake to go if you are ok standing in  a mosh pit for literally an hour with no available seating because you need to be standing right by the counter to hear your name called.  The cashiers call your name twice in the loud waiting area of 50 people and then happily give up and put your finished bag to the side, where it stays unless you fight your way to the front to ask about it. Did I miss my name being called?  No, they just didn't have it yet.  Now, if you're going to say, ""Your order will be ready in an hour"", then great, no issue, just be honest.  But when you say my order will be up in 15-20 minutes, that's not ok.   It's not worth the hassle, they have no organization and a huge lack of efficiency.  It looked like what took so long is the restaurant is always packed with people ordering cheesecake after their meal, and waiters kept cutting in everytime a seated patron ordered a slice, forget the to-go orders that have been waiting."
Nicholas E.,"Novi, MI",99,1,1,1.0,1/13/2017,I ordered take out for the first time at the Novi location and was quoted 25 min. I waited 25 min to pick up my entrees and then waited an additional 25 min to cash out and get my food. I waited a total of 50 min for a freaking burger! Waste of time! Staff at the Togo bar couldn't offer any help and could not explain where the cashier was. Excuse me but what kind be of business are you running here? If your a business person on lunch break I don't recommend this location for lunch... You will be highly disappointed like I was.
K R.,"Pontiac, MI",0,12,2,1.0,1/13/2017,"Not impressed with this place. Placed a online order they quoted 25. Get the in 25 min and there's confusion around my order. I waited an additional 20 mins to get my food, I only have a 30 min lunch break. Hence why I ordered over the phone. Not cool, not impressed. I could've just ordered in store and waited the same amount of time. Get my order and I have no napkins, no eating utensils. So I have to eat my veggie burger that fell apart with my hands. Again not how I expected this experience to go. Not placing a phone order from here EVER again."
Ed M.,"Rochester Hills, MI",19,7,,4.0,9/16/2017,The food is delicious. The service is great. The prices are as expected. My only qualm is the ridiculous wait times. No reservations. No call ahead seating. Carve out 4-5 hours for a meal.
Dan F.,"Farmington Hills, MI",0,7,,1.0,8/28/2017,"Surreal! I asked my family to take me there for my birthday, and it turned out to be a disaster. To start, we were told it would be a 45-60 minute wait. Now, this isn't atypical for this location, but since they're still on the old fashioned pager system instead of a proper text alert system like so many restaurants are embracing (and with their consistently long wait times, it's obscene that they haven't switched), we were stuck waiting near the place for that time, lest we go too far and lose our spot. It took nearly 85 minutes to get a table. Why? Their dishwasher broke, and supposedly they were having trouble getting clean dishes out to people as a result; a fact the hostess failed to tell me about when I checked in at the 45 minute mark, when she insisted it'd only be another 10 minutes. We got told at the 70 minute mark. So by the time we sit down, the whole family is pretty hungry and grumpy. I will say, our waiter took good care of us. He was polite, and efficient. He was the only redeeming factor of the evening. I ordered the Factory burrito, which turned out very bland and even a bit cold. My dad, however, got the shaft big time. He ordered the fish and chips, which were not only cold, but tasted like the sat in the oil way too long. After he sent it back and requested an order of chicken fingers, we all split our plates with him so he wouldn't sit there empty handed, but it was another 25 minutes before we gave up on the chicken fingers. We managed to get the fish and chips taken off the bill, and the chicken fingers came in literally as we were getting up from the table.  I would give them 1 1/2 stars, because I liked the waiter, and he at least tried to make it right for us, but overall, this was a lousy experience. By the time we were done, I didn't even want a slice of cheesecake, which was half the reason I came in the first place. I don't think I'll be back. any time soon, if at all."
Susan M.,"Troy, MI",188,351,611,4.0,12/20/2016,The wait to be seated can be excruciating. Take turns with a friend or eat elsewhere. The menu is overwhelming with options. The lettuce wraps are perfect. I buy a whole cheesecake to take home and freeze half for later. Defrosts in fridge in 2 hours to enjoy later in the month.
Jennifer W.,"Redford, MI",42,518,853,4.0,8/7/2016,"I've been to Cheesecake Factory several times in several different cities. On this visit I ordered the Mac and Cheese burger.  I ordered it medium well, but it was burnt on one side when it came out and the beef patty was significantly smaller than the bun.  The waitress was very apologetic and returned it to the kitchen.  She left the fries for me to nosh on while I waited.  My friend had ordered the shrimp platter so I ordered that as a replacement.  I'm actually glad the burger was burnt.  The shrimp was very good.  I even liked the coleslaw.   I placed a takeout order for a slice of carrot cake, caramel pecan turtle cheesecake, and the salted caramel cheesecake.  They were delicious.  You can't go wrong with any of their desserts.  My combined visits here are a 4.  Some have been better than others.  Our waitress on this visit was great also."
Brigitte B.,"Brighton, MI",12,47,5,1.0,12/2/2016,"Very disappointed!   I totally understand not wanting strollers in the restaurant, but seriously,  a 1 month baby can't have a car seat at the table????  How r we supposed to enjoy our expensive ""for what you get"" meal, with a baby in your lap?   The person that sat us was very rude and we couldn't figure out how we were gonna enjoy our  meal with a baby in someone's lap  the entire time.   We ended up leaving. Very poor customer service.  As I'd he wasn't bothered one way or another.  I know this won't hurt their business, but still needed to be voiced.     Won't be back."
James A.,"Southfield, MI",21,6,4,1.0,12/18/2016,The Cheese Cake restaurant in Novi has horrible service. I have never been more disrespected in my life. I wanted to purchase two gift cards and was told to go wait in line behind 10 who were buying cheesecake. I was already at the register. When I got back to to register after waiting 30 minutes in line. Was asked what do I want. Well you told me to get back in line. I want to gift cards. After that asked Brittany that's her name a question and before I could say anything she told me with her finger up one minute!!!! Gave me my gift cards not knowing which one had what amount on each. Cheesecake Factory in Novi Michigan can kiss my BLACK ASS!! Will never come back and had to wait 21/2 hours at that.
Jill C.,"West Bloomfield Township, MI",3,73,47,2.0,1/24/2017,"Food was good/very good but not excellent as the 5 times I ate at a Cheesecake Factory in Tucson and Pheonix.  Was such a crowded wait here it killed some of the experience, too. Was the food worth the hassle? Not for me."
Shavon M.,"Redford Charter Township, MI",0,12,15,2.0,3/19/2017,"Aside from the long wait. The food came out cold and missing items that was supposed to come with the meal. Over all The Cheesecake Factory is better experienced outside of Novi, Michigan."
Linda P.,"Plymouth, MI",3,67,114,3.0,11/5/2016,"I have eaten here at the cheesecake factory 5 times now. I have sampled my way through the menu and of course the desserts as well. The entrée items I have ordered seem to be on the heavier side, meaning creamy with thicker sauces. The portions are good, if not large. The Santa Fe salad is huge. Desserts are also good. The homemade strawberry shortcake was really good and enough for two to easily share. Service is spotty; some days are better than others.  And the music is loud. The restaurant is loud and it's hard to have a conversation with someone across from you. It's been that way every time."
Joan P.,"Walled Lake, MI",0,8,,2.0,8/13/2017,"Too costly for the quality and type of food on the menu, no better then most resturants. However, the cheesecakes served are delicious."
E S.,"Royal Oak, MI",1,19,4,1.0,4/3/2016,"I cannot stand mediocre restaurants that try to put out an image of exclusivity when they are no better than your neighborhood Applebee's. We walked into an empty restaurant at 10:45 on a Sunday morning  (45 minutes after they open) and were told that it was a 30 minute wait. I watched this happen for the next 40 minutes until there were more people waiting to be sat than there were people actually at tables. In the meantime we are watching the waitstaff, barstaff and host staff socialize in the empty dining area.  We finally were sat and the food was decent (not bad, but not worth the wait). I must note that ALL of our plates were too hot to touch. For anyone who has not worked in the food industry: this means your food sat under a heat lamp for at least 5 minutes. Restaurants don't have ""plate warmers"".  As we left we saw that the wait was well over an hour (for lunch!!)  which could have been prevented by moving things along starting with the people who arrived earlier.  Management: if you are listening and care- there are better ways of running your front of the house. There were a lot of other irritated people waiting to be sat who had the same grumblings as me.  We will not be back."
Deneca A.,"West Bloomfield Township, MI",6,15,51,3.0,1/17/2017,I enjoyed my dinner & I will recommend this dish. I wished it also came with green beans. The price is $17.50 for the Famous Factory Meatloaf.
Tim M.,"Rochester Hills, MI",23,10,6,5.0,8/5/2017,Excellent.  There is always a long wait but that's because the food is always excellent.  Every dish I have had here is good.  Whenever I am traveling Cheesecake Factory is always a standby. They really need to build more of these in Michigan.
Christina R.,"Crestview, FL",2,16,4,5.0,1/14/2017,"This ccf is amazing and ive visited many in different states. This is by far the best.  Wait time was only 20 minutes at the most and it's now packed, food was awesome and our server is that deal.  All for miss jennie. Thanks for being awesome, patient and just a gem. If i come only because of her excellent service it will be worth it.  I'm very satisfied.  Restrooms are clean and everyone happy...and i mean I'm getting paid well and can eat cheesecake daily happy.  Valet $5 fast and courteous and mall is beautiful with great shopping right outside the door."
Cindy A.,"Farmington Hills, MI",212,163,218,3.0,8/24/2015,"Let's get a few things clear. Yes, the line is pretty long. Yes, it's probably a two hour wait and yes, they freeze their cheesecakes.  .  Frozen Cheesecakes It's no secret, I've been told by multiple staff members their popular desserts are ALL frozen. They thaw it out 1-2 hours prior to their fridge display. So um... THAT WOULDN'T FLY IF YOU TRIED ORDERING THIS STUFF FROM A LOCAL BAKERY, but you know, it's cool. It's acceptable because it's a name brand and we are all somewhat disconnected with how food actually makes it way into our bellies anyway. No Money No Cake.  Overall, the slices are quite pricey. If you don't have the time to make it yourself, or have a friend that has a friend that can make this for you. Then fine, come here, treat yourself. I'm in that category. But trust me when I say this, I tried calling local bakeries. No one can make this because it's seasonal. So....  I ordered a 10"" red velvet cheesecake for my hubby's birthday ($53). AND Goodness that cake was rich. Our family tried to devour it but even for 12 guests, I still had six fat slices left over. Good thing I can freeze them... Anyway moving on to food... The salads are amazing and the jambalaya pasta is to die for.  If you want to wait in line, you have to try their food. If you just want cheesecake, there's a section that you can just order a slice and take it to go. Conclusion: TCF is pretty good. Try coming on a weekday for dinner or for brunch. If you have to get together for dinner than bring friends so you can take turns waiting in line/go shopping at 12 oaks."
Jameson J.,"Westland, MI",57,113,219,4.0,5/27/2016,"I have been here several times. Long waits when they first opened but as people got their fix their waits slowed. I like their low calorie menu, it's filling and the portions are just. I had the veggie burger from the low calorie menu. It was absolutely great. We also had the egg roll sampler the sauce on the sampler are worth keeping when your fries come. At first the waiter brought the wrong Burger, instead of the veggie burger however the manager came over and apologized offered me some free items and fixed the veggie Burger. Overall I am impressed with the Cheesecake Factorys Service,  it's not really the service when everything goes smoothly it's the service when things go wrong that matter."
Kai T.,"Flint, MI",0,2,,1.0,7/23/2017,The service I received today was unacceptable. I was completely ignored the entire time until it was time to pay then he arrowed toward the tip section. I will no longer tip for customer service that is substandard I'm over it. PLEASE PICK ANOTHER CAREER!!!!!!
