Marijane T.,"Northville, MI",2,1,,2.0,10/16/2017,Very frustrating to understand why people at the CF think they can stand around and waste time while the customers are waiting on them.  Last time I will go there !  It's overpriced and I can get the Cheesecake at Costco for less.  Kick myself for not going to Costco to get the cake.  Waited 30 minutes for them to prep my cake.  I had 1 lady ahead of me.  I hope you can better manage your time at CF Novi than what I saw!!!  What a waste of everyone's time for everyone to have the staff standing around trying to figure out their personal lives.
Tony C.,"Livonia, MI",86,297,55,3.0,2/21/2016,"I've never been to a more overrated restaurant than Cheesecake Factory in Novi. It all starts with the wait-I've tried to get into here a couple times and the wait has been always been over an hour (one times it was 3.5 hours). I'm sorry, but 1. Nothing is worth waiting for, 2. Restaraunts aren't worth waiting for 3. Cheesecake Factory is not worth waiting for. There is really no system to the waiting the entrance is small so they suggests you wait in the mall area. They give you a buzzer and tell you, you can walk around the mall...but don't tell you how far you can go.  Once you finally get a seat the service is terrible. We sat for 10 minutes until someone came over and asked if we had been waited on. We said no and she picked us up as her table...the table next to us ordered around the time we did, we were done and had received the bill and they hadn't received their food.  I can't complain about the food, it is good. But not an hour good or 3.5 hours good. Had the burrito and we got some small plates (Cuban sandwich egg rolls and buffalo chicken meatballs). The food is the only thing that saves this place from getting 1 star.  I've been to the location in Chicago where I have never had to wait... I'm not sure why this is but I have an idea. The location is just too small, not enough room for a bar, carry out, bakery and seating. Everyone is sitting on top of each other because too much was thrown into a space that can't handle it."
Jerry D.,"Pinckney, MI",5,21,9,5.0,5/30/2017,"As always the food is good but tonight's visit was made even better by our waiter Jake; he made our dining experience fun and insightful.  For great service and overall fun and enjoyable experience while dining here, ask to sit in Jake's section.  He doesn't work on Monday's but he's there most other days of the week; checkout Sunday mornings for brunch as well.  Thanks Jake for a wonderful time; Cheesecake Factory has an excellent employee and I hope they appreciate the level of service you provide their customers; you made us feel like family and friends!  Also, your entree suggestions were spot on; we'll certainly be back for more..."
Jessica H.,"Farmington, MI",3,37,14,3.0,4/23/2017,"Overpriced and overcrowded. Seriously, you can get much better food anywhere down Novi road or grand river. If you want to eat here, be prepared to wait no matter what time you go. Cheesecake is phenomenal though...try getting it though carry out!"
Stephanie B.,"New Baltimore, MI",56,299,324,4.0,2/2/2016,"My boyfriend and I dined here the other night for my birthday. We've been here a couple times in a past and loved it.  While the wait was an hour for Saturday afternoon, we didn't mind at all. We snagged a pager and shopped the mall for an hour and when we came back our pager when off. When we came back the wait was over three hours long so make a day of it and understand that you will most likely have a wait.  We got placed at a two seater table at one end of the restaurant. Perfect spot because we were out the way in the very crowded restaurant.  Menu is humongous and actually has page numbers.  I ordered the chicken tacos that came with a side of veggies. 3 corn shell tacos stuffed with chicken and pico. Yum!   They give you bread to munch on while you wait and it's to die for!  We had a Carryout of the kahlua cheesecake and it was heavenly!  We will definitely be back for special occasions. It's about an hour drive from my house. Service has always been great- as well as the food."
Scott U.,"Downingtown, PA",148,21,15,1.0,10/15/2016,"Worst Cheesecake Factory location in the country.  I have been to over a dozen locations across the country and the manager of this location is rude, condescending and not customer friendly.  A server dumped a whole Nutella cheesecake on my college-aged daughter - she is highly allergic to tree nuts and broke out in hives, had trouble breathing etc.  The manager took over an HOUR to come and talk to my daughter.  He refused to provide any information about the server, the exact ingredients of the cake or provide my daughter any compensation for having a whole cake dumped on her head (in her hair too).  We complained to Corporate and they credited my daughter's credit card for her order and then they recharged her card later the same day.  WTF Cheesecake Factory? The entire waitstaff and management of this location is rude and needs to be replaced...pronto!"
Melvin F.,"Wayne, MI",24,42,4,4.0,4/18/2017,Me and my wife love this place. Food is great and we've always had great servers. The only downside is the wait times but that's not bad.
Terri K.,"Harbor Springs, MI",8,9,,2.0,9/24/2016,Very loud environment that was not conducive to conversation. I had the chicken salad skin version on lettuce without the bun.  Chicken salad was salty and lacked any flavor besides mayonnaise.  I asked for dressing on the side and  when plate was delivered the dressing was missing.  It finally arrived after asking 2 people and finished most of my salad.  Server only asked to refill my tea once after it sat nearly empty for most of my time with food. Another person at table ordered baked potato soup and a sandwich with bacon on the side.  Soup was cold and salty as well.  Bacon was missing. Third in our party orders burger and fries.  Fries were cold and hard. For all the hype about the chain it was an over priced disappointment.  No thank you.
Michelle R.,"Pinckney, MI",0,3,,1.0,11/7/2017,"I HATE writing bad reviews but here we go, well today me and my friends went to the Cheesecake Factory to get lunch. I was so excited bc I usually love this place and plus it was one of my friends first time there ever. I got the Santa Fe chicken salad( lunch portion) My girlfriend got the spicy cashew chicken with white rice and my other girlfriend got the Chinese chicken salad. When I got mine the Santa Fe salad, I started to eat it until I saw some black/silver shiny wool/metal piece in it. I then took out one long piece and then continued to look and found another black piece. I can't believe i even found them because In that specific salad it had corn, beans, cheese,chicken,tortillas and tomatoes. I then asked to see the manger. He came out and confirmed it was a piece of wool from the cleaning crew. He did say sorry and offered me a different dish and a dessert and I said I didn't want another dish but I'd take the dessert to go. The manger didn't seem to sorry and was very unprofessional about the situation. I would of gave everyone that was with me a free dessert and also took care of thier Meals as well for free. We will never come back to this place again. I wonder how many other times this has happened or even if anyone has caught it in their salad!!!! It was like the wool scrubbers you use to clean your stove with or dishes with. I was mortified!!"
Anita B.,"Northville, MI",138,111,184,1.0,1/2/2016,"Literally waited OVER 3 hrs & returned to be told it's another 10-15 minutes. This place needs to have better turnover and people that know how to speak to a customer. Just for these reasons alone, I give this place a 1. No restaurant -  especially this one, is worth an over 3 hour wait. They removed us from the list because we didn't come back at a guess of time to get a beeper. Pardon me! They should have more pagers, work with reservations or have a better system in place.  The food is not outstanding. Nor is the cheesecake. EVEN Chicago Cheesecake Factory knows how to manage the crowd- even Vegas does. Your hostess- the one that GREETS potential customers - is rude. Jennifer needs a dishwashing job.  The only thing that made the night was our server, Stephanie. She was incredible and is the epitome of what The Cheesecake Factory employee should be.  The best one we've ever had in the several visits we've experienced.  She gets the full 5 stars and should be promoted to management."
Michael R.,"Auburn Hills, MI",2,16,5,2.0,5/2/2017,Food is average but the cheesecake is always good. Service is also pretty sloppy. The fact we had to wait 30 min for our dessert and about 45 min for our food. The waitress also didn't pay attention to what we asked for I personally had to ask 3 times for lemons.
Cindy S.,"Novi, MI",0,7,,1.0,1/31/2017,"Two of us went in for a late lunch.  Three empty tables next to us (so the place was not overly busy), yet we waited 55 minutes (after ordering for our food) before reaching out to our waitress, Meghan, to ""PLEASE check on our order."" She said she would; then proceeded to take another table's order, then go to the computer to enter their order.  THEN, my salad which was supposed to have beets, asparagus, goat cheese, grilled chicken, and candied pecans (yum! right?!) came back as a bowl of lettuce with a few chopped beets.  Rather than fixing it promptly, the waitress started arguing that she could see a piece of asparagus and that the ""appetizer"" salads come with fewer toppings.  I didn't order an appetizer salad. I ordered a regular salad.  And, one piece of asparagus, really???  When Meghan came back to ask if we would be having cheesecake today, my friend said, ""shouldn't there be a complimentary piece for the long wait and salad fiasco?""  The waitress said she would ask her manager. She returned saying that Catherine, the manager, said ""No.""  Well, the next time we're thinking of a place to eat and anyone suggests The Cheesecake Factory, my answer will be ""No!"""
Carrie A.,"Walled Lake, MI",8,16,,2.0,2/13/2017,"The food is good, that's it...good. It's not head over heals spectacular. The cheesecake is delicious but why why why did it take 2 hours to get cheesecake? That doesn't include the 40 minutes we waited to get in. We were prepared for a wait to get in but seriously? It took 118 minutes from the moment we sat down to the moment our cheesecake was delivered to our table. We didn't even go for dinner, just dessert.  The next trip we went in a Sunday right after opening for lunch & cheesecake. Figuring the 2 hour cheesecake situation had to be a flop maybe because it was Friday and so on. Nope, over 2 hours for lunch and another 45 for cheesecake.  I'm very perplexed as to what is going on in the kitchen? Are there live chickens in there? Is the chicken piccata that fresh? Kinda bummed because they have some really great cheesecake flavors but I can't waste an entire afternoon for cheesecake."
Christina S.,"Detroit, MI",55,12,4,2.0,3/26/2017,"Went for brunch with a couple of friends, which technically was just breakfast items on the regular 20 page menu. Nothing super special or different. Waited about 30 minutes for all of our food that came out cold. Also, they brought out one of our meals 15 minutes before getting the rest of the tables food out. Was disappointing because I've been for dinner and had some tasty food. I wouldn't recommend for brunch. But we were hungry and didn't want to wait the two hours at Toasted Oak."
Tacarra L.,"West Bloomfield Township, MI",20,82,37,2.0,7/6/2016,"There are very few, if any, redeeming qualities about this restaurant. Please read all of the more recent reviews, because none of them are exaggerated. We had to ask for bread, our appetizer took 20-30 minutes, and after finishing our appetizer and our drink we waited 30 minutes for cold, inedible food. The food looked dry and you could tell that it was siting under the warmers for God only knows how long. My husband, who is the more even tempered and patient of the two of us, ended up saying something to our waitress. The food and service was simply unacceptable. The manager, Brandon, came over and offered is cheesecake on the house and took my inedible entree off our bill, which was very nice of him. However, we sat there for another 30 minutes waiting for the cheesecake. We finally ended up paying our bill and leaving without the cheesecake, as we had other engagements to make it to.  I've always been a fan of Cheesecake Factory and I LOVE their sister company ""Grand Luxe Cafe"", but today's visit at this location will likely be my last."
Don C.,"Farmington, MI",0,23,,1.0,9/21/2017,"Even the carry out is terrible service. Picked up a cheesecake for a party and that was a disorganized mess. Wasn't greeted, had to wait even though it was supposed to be ready, attitude from the worker at the desk......what a miserable place this is."
Tonia B.,"Carleton, MI",0,16,19,1.0,8/7/2016,We went to the Cheesecake Factory for dinner last night and had the most horrible experience I have ever had in a restaurant.  My BF asked for the remainder of his meal to be wrapped.  So they took his plate away to do so.  A little while later the waiter came back to the table and told him he was sorry - that his meal had been thrown away but they would make him a new meal to bring home if he would like.  He told them that would be great.  About ten minutes later the waiter comes back out with a box telling my BF that they had found his meal and that it has not been thrown away.  However - when my BF opened the box - it was very obvious they had dug his food out of the trash and thrown it on a box .... As there was other food in there that was not a part of his meal.
Ester V.,"Perrysburg, OH",3,2,25,1.0,11/26/2016,"Took longer than quoted waited. It was supposed to be a birthday dinner with my family and we all ate at separate times because each entree was brought at different times. Ordered a drink from the bar and server forgot about it so I didn't get until the end of my meal. Ordered to slices of cheesecake to go and she again ""forgot"" so I had to wait even longer. Mind you I drove nearly 2 hours to get here to get the worst service ever! I've been to multiple Cheesecake Factory restaurants over the years and never had a bad experience until I came to this one. I don't recommend anyone visit this one. Horrible experience from beginning to end"
Alex F.,"Scotts Valley, CA",168,5,,1.0,9/19/2017,"Love the food here, however i'v been waiting for over a half hour with little to no service. I had to ask for the bread to be brought out to us by another server and when the food finally came out it was the wrong order. We then had to wait for them to remake both orders.."
Erin C.,"Dearborn, MI",147,17,44,3.0,2/22/2016,"The food was decent and the cheesecake was good, but why in God's name did it take 40 minutes to get seated (eventually the wait time was 2 hrs!), 30 minutes to get our food (""fresh rice""), and another 30 minutes to get our cheesecake?! For lunch, that's a ridiculous amount of time.  Our waiter was very kind and he did apologize for the wait. It was not his fault. Even after our $25 gift card our lunch with tip was $40. Two fish taco dinners (with rice & beans), two iced teas, and two cheesecakes to go. Not worth the wait or the price. If you want cheesecake, order ahead and do carry out."
