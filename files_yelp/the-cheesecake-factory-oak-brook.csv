Jamie R.,"Elmhurst, IL",3,15,41,4.0,12/26/2017,"ah! the cheesecake factory. home of the cheesecakes and tasty variety of food!  tonight started off with some yummy bread & lemonade! the lemonade cup had the top rimmed with sugar, but i was very thirsty and found the lemonade to be a bit tangy instead of refreshing but i was so thirsty i had to drink 3 cups of it!  we also got the truffle bacon grilled cheese which was so so good and literally heaven in my mouth.  i ordered the fried mac n cheese & fries! the fried mac n cheese is soooo good & really creamy when you bite into it. they're also sitting in a type of sauce that seems to be a type of marinara sauce but it's sweeter and lighter. the fries were really good too but the bowl of fries were bigger than i had thought they would but was still priced well enough for what they were. unfortunately, i got really full with eating bread & the truffle bacon grilled cheese sticks, so i'm going to bring food home to eat later! along with a vanilla bean cheesecake which sounds amazing!   would come here again a million times because there's a great variety of food!"
Ellen M.,"Oak Park, IL",454,1259,161,3.0,1/7/2018,"People just love this place, especially out of town friends, and I can never understand it. Fortunately, they have avocado toast, so I'll always be ok. Amazingly, they serve cuisine from a number of ethnicities, but with...well, suburban American flair. Most plates look appealing enough. Everything is very salty though, and I get the impression that there's not a lot of fresh ingredients in the kitchen.  The first thing they want to know is what overpriced wine you'd like. It smacks of efficiency; corporate food."
Melissa K.,"Downers Grove, IL",46,68,5,3.0,1/1/2018,"Definitely your typical Cheesecake factory location- Nothing out of the ordinary.  I've consistently had decent servers who know a great deal about the cheesecakes and the giant menu- which is surprising, but good. I have to note, and I think this is a constant at all cheesecake factories, the lighting is absolutely horrible. I'm not sure what type of ambiance they're going for, but it's one short step above dining in the dark.  Food is decent, the portions are out of control large, and the cheesecake is a must."
Nina H.,"Chicago, IL",2,20,14,1.0,1/5/2018,So we're going on 90 minutes of waiting after being told that the wait was 50 minutes!  So as a result of the sunk cost fallacy we continued to wait because we had invested so much time already. But I am beyond pissed so this food better be beyond delicious and this server better bring it!
Sherry P.,"Romeoville, IL",37,89,240,3.0,1/1/2018,"Great service at The Cheesecake Factory but mediocre food. The calamari was fresh and very tasty. The soup however was croutons and shredded cheese for French onion. Also, not many onions at all and not much flavor. The kids meal looked delicious and chicken was moist. The four cheese pasta was okay. It was edible but nothing I'd want again. It was room temperature, noodles were very hard and the taste just wasn't all that great. Strawberry shortcake for dessert was not sweet at all. It was lacking a syrup or flavor to the shortcake. It was very dry. Nothing was awful, but wouldn't go back."
Nina I.,"Chicago, IL",667,491,62,5.0,11/16/2017,"AH, the good old cheesecake factory. This place is something special, with it's 300 + menu items and 60 deserts+drinks, it's unbeatable in food choice. LITERALLY something for everyone.  I came here for a casual dinner with my boyfriend. We both had the baja chicken tacos. I was kind of upset though. Their normally huge portions - the bang for your buck menu - is no longer! These tacos used to be huge and now there's literally four two-bite tacos that barely fed me! They were still extremely delicious though. We also had Mai Thai's and of course the chocolate bread was on point per usual. Staff was also great as always and manager Kim V. was full of energy and happily walking around making sure all the guests (including us!) were happy by coming to our table after the first few bites and checking on the quality of our food.  Overall yes, yes, YES to anyone who's thinking about stopping by!"
G S.,"Chicago, IL",8,96,230,1.0,1/5/2018,We were told 45 mins for a table and it's been 1 hours and 30 minutes. No food worth this wait. My last time here. Get with the times and take reservations. I'm not coming back here ever again.
Melinda C.,"Bloomington, IN",136,57,47,4.0,11/6/2017,"I was pleasantly surprised by my experience here. When I think of big chains, I usually think a loss of quality, but this was not the case. The quality was great, the service was good, and the food was delicious. What I was most surprised by was the options on the menu. There was just about anything you could want to choose from.  We got some drinks at the bar before while we waited, these were also very good. The wait was shorter than anticipated too which is nice. I can't wait to go back already!"
S. C.,"Aurora, IL",4,19,3,3.0,1/7/2018,"We were a party of 5 midafternoon on a Sunday. It was pretty busy. We didn't have reservations and waited 30 minutes for a table. Drinks were brought promptly. There was a little wait to order our meal but the food arrived faster than expected and our server made sure we didn't run out of bread. The dishes were tasty but not spectacular. The food that was supposed to be hot was and the cold food was chilled just right. My water wasn't refilled as quickly as I like, my son had to remind the waiter to bring his soda, and also the dressing for his fries. It was a good meal. I would visit this restaurant again but this time it didn't deserve five stars."
Michelle T.,"North Riverside, IL",1522,210,813,4.0,6/29/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory, a great franchised American staple that everyone knows and loves! Sure portion sizes aid in the epidemic of obesity and ordering a cheesecake for dessert will push you over the Richter scale of gluttony but that's what doggie bags are for! I have one dish I am infatuated with and get nearly every time I come here. That is, the Jamaican Blackened Pepper Shrimp! Dear Lord, everything on this plate goes so well with together. Platanos, black beans, white rice, pineapple salsa, shrimp, and amazing spicy black pepper sauce that will have you dipping bread in it until every last drop is gone! If you haven't tried this yet, please order it!  Some of my other favorites include: -Tex Mex Eggrolls as an appetizer  -SkinnyLicious Shrimp Summer Rolls (my only dislike is that they're not rolled tight enough and sometimes the ingredients fall out into the dipping sauce.) -Orange Chicken  -Cajun Jumbalaya Pasta  Dessert favorites include: -Godiva Cheesecake  -Chocolate Mouse Cheesecake  *Whipped Cream is everything!  The Oakbrook location has a large outdoor patio and decor and ambiance is always stunning. During peak hours there's always a wait so be prepared."
Mario T.,"Chicago, IL",13,2,1,3.0,12/8/2017,Don't come in and order a burger/cheeseburger well done becuase they will over cook it. It looked good on the outside as soon as I tried cutting into it I knew it wasn't right. I tried eating a piece of it and it was tough. It's sad when I could walk into a wing place and they make better burgers regardless of how you order it. My Gf's chicken looked a bit undercooked which is why I stay away from chicken plates. Their ridiculously huge menu is 80% chicken. At least the ambience and service were good and the manager did right when I complained. Drinks were properly chilled/cold
Stephanie B.,"Chicago, IL",140,11,1,2.0,10/24/2017,"My husband asked ""Is this like a test facility? Is this where everyone comes to train. It's a very awkward atmosphere.""  Cheesecake excellent, the rest is a lot left to be desired."
Ramiro O.,"Chicago, IL",0,23,14,5.0,12/29/2017,"Massive portions and you can't go wrong with what you pick because it will be good. I have had many items through out the years and have never complained about any of them. You can bring the pickiest of eaters here and they will find something to pick from the menu. You can get good food, drinks, desert, and service as that has been my experience on every visit. I would avoid busy times because the wait could be very long. Or plan ahead and don't arrive when you are very hungry or you will end up walking out and going somewhere else. This place does not take reservations either."
Donna H.,"Villa Park, IL",1,57,5,5.0,12/7/2017,Kudos to Cheesecake Factory for having vegan and vegetarian options. I was so pleasantly surprised that there is an entire page dedicated to vegetarian items. Can you say avocado toast??? Yum
Melanie C.,"Chicago, IL",263,72,122,4.0,3/20/2017,"Cheesecake Factory is a family favorite. There's so much on the menu. There's something for everyone.  Waitresses are always pretty happy and welcoming even though they have a lot on their plate (hehe)  Speaking of plates, the portions here are pretty huge which compensates for the prices. Some things are kind of overpriced (like the mex fusion or Asian fusion stuff) but it's a treat for people that don't have a lot of authentic restaurant in the area. To start, the whole wheat bread is pretty good.. it gives a five star based on the theory of ""judge a restaurant by the free bread"".  The calamari is probably the best I've had. It's lightly breaded and I don't get the feeling that it's frozen. So good, I'd be deceived if the tartar sauce or cocktail sauce is homemade.  Entree wise, I usually get the chicken and shrimp gumbo cuz it's creamy, tomato-y, spicyish from the andouille sausage. Something I rarely find in the Midwest.  This place is the epitome of an American restaurant and I'm glad is a pretty solid chain restaurant.  I'm also not a cheesecake junky. I just come for the food. I bet the cheesecake is really good. My sister always gets the Oreo supreme and never shares.  I only knock off stars for the overcrowdedness being next to a mall :(.. a fourty min wait is wack."
Sashja P.,"Chicago, IL",24,41,61,2.0,7/26/2017,"The quality of their food has declined drastically! Dined here 7/25/17 for my daughters birthday and she ordered Fettuccine but it looks like chicken noodle soup  We had some type of chicken appetizer and it looked like the chicken was looking at us on the TABLE!   The ambiance is still nice, it's pretty good for a meeting place for drinks, that's the impression i gathered. So many patriots had cocktails but not eating.  I guess i didn't get that memo.  The waitress was nice.  But so disappointed in the restaurant! Will not visit again."
G H.,"Chicago, IL",5,74,192,4.0,8/27/2017,Good food order from the skinny menu. Taste was great portion was just smaller  Tried the shrimp alfredo. Had strawberry cheesecake never dissapoints
Bonnie V.,"Burns Harbor, IN",36,4,2,1.0,10/8/2017,"Still waiting for the 2ed hour for a table they said would take 1.20 mins. Yes we're a large group of 11 + baby but to wait this long to be told we're waiting for the last people to leave, they paid their bill but they're not leaving! Find us another table that will work for us! This is ridiculous!!! Now after waiting 2 hours our family members that we've waited with a child had to leave because the baby had to eat."
Mayra Z.,"Schaumburg, IL",124,260,476,3.0,7/22/2017,"I came here for brunch and was so underwhelmed with the service, Schaumburg always has better service. I ordered a skinnylious burger with salad and my boyfriend ordered the lunch portion of the orange chicken. To drink i ordered coffee and he ordered a mimosa and bloody mary.  The food was awesome as usual his orange chicken was so good! I wished I would have orderedit too! Hands down the best meal I've ever had here. The pieces of chicken were large and crispy. The sauce it was in was flavorful, sweet and tangy I loved how it got all over the white rice and coated the veggies with the chicken. The service....sigh....he forgot to offer us bread and then realized himself he forgot to offer it, we said no as we realized our meals were almost coming out. I ordered coffee and was never asked for a refill we had to get his attention and ask for it, same thing with my boyfriend's drinks we waved him down again for his drinks.  I think we will be sticking to the Schaumburg location. Oakbrook never seems to get the service right, unless we sit at the bar, like we have in the past."
Carolline K.,"Bensenville, IL",71,16,10,4.0,12/16/2017,"Came in here for a drink before an interview. Super packed and busy. I sat at the bar and had a Long Island. It was delicious and even though the bartenders were running around making orders nonstop, they were super sweet and would small chat with you."
Jessica S.,"Warrenville, IL",45,11,1,1.0,12/19/2017,"Very disappointed with this experience. We had an awful wait time. The hosts were so disorganized. They told us any minute 40 minutes in to our wait, then again an hour and 20 minutes into wait. They called us just to tell us to wait some more to the side. Servers were running around and bumping into people. The few times I got up from my seat, servers were bumping into me, with no apology.  Our server was so busy/apathetic. His name was Marcelino. We waited in the lobby (with a toddler) for an hour and 45 minutes. We were told it would be 45 minute wait. We sat down and waited for a server to greet us. He didn't say his name just asked if we were ready to order. We asked for another minute. He was about to leave when I had to say that I wanted to order a drink. I asked for a extra dirty martini. It was not extra dirty or dirty at all. I actually went up to the bartender and requested more olive juice. Our waiter saw me do this and asked nothing as to why.  He didn't come back to our table for another 20 minutes before we could order food. (we have a toddler). I asked for a kids menu. Never brought it until a member of our party asked a different waiter. (This took until our server came back 20 mins later.) for him to check on us to get the kids menu. We ordered apps and dinner. Our food was great. All except the kids chicken nuggets that I ordered for my toddler. We asked to have fruit instead of fries. They bring out fries. Fine. They said they would bring us out a fruit bowl. Minutes later, they take the fries away to give to another member of our table. Without a word. Weird, we thought. Since, already they messed up, why wouldn't they just let us keep the fries and bring out the other persons fries an additional order. That is usually what restaurants do. The Chicken fingers were horrible. We got them for our 18 months old and it was all breading. We had to really tear apart the chicken fingers to get to meat, which is all we would be giving to our child. I honestly expected more.  Overall, really disappointing. I think its been about 10 years since I have been here. I don't plan on coming back. I know that this last weekend was really busy for you all, but there has to be a better way. There were 10 people in our party and I know that we spent well over $700. You could have made it a better experience."
Ariane M.,"Chicago, IL",41,15,,4.0,12/14/2017,Nothing great or special except that it's close to my job whenever I have a craving for cheesecake. And of course it's ridiculously busy because it's part of the Oakbrook center. Be prepared for a wait even if you're going to pick up cheesecake.
Reem S.,"Lombard, IL",30,18,18,2.0,11/20/2017,"I went here on Saturday with my son for an early birthday dinner for myself, and had a really bad experience.  First, I called to ask what the estimated wait was for 2 people. The person who answered said 20/25 minutes. When I got there, they told me 30. I expected that, no problem. I arrived at 5:40PM. At 30 mins, I asked how much longer, and the hostess said 5 minutes. At 50 minutes, I was frustrated. I had a 7:15 movie to get to. I also wanted to do a starter, dinner, and dessert, and this was cutting it close. I spoke with the hostess and she was very dismissive and unapologetic. She said they couldn't account for people sitting there. I told her that's fine, but give me realistic expectations. If she told me 45 minutes when I got there, I would have left. She then argued with me that I have been waiting 43 minutes, not 48. I told her I have a text to my bf saying the wait when I got there at 5:40, so they waited to enter me in. She said no it automatically does it. She was rude and not good at her job. Finally we were seated and I figured it would still be okay but it took the waiter 10 minutes to walk over to us. I tried flagging other people down but no one came close. We were only able to enjoy our main dish. I had to take our cheesecakes to go. The food was good, and the waiter after that was nice. I asked him for the manager and he said he asked for them twice and they also never came. If management doesnt show up, why would their employees. I've been to a ton of cheesecake factories and this was really bad service. I'm never coming here again."
Nina I.,"Glendale Heights, IL",39,54,43,5.0,5/27/2017,"Never disappointing, always accommodating, always great service, and always delicious. There's a reason why this restaurant, at every location, is always packed.  I have to keep my sodium intake low, which is impossible when you eat out. Having said that, here they've always accommodated my request to refrain from adding salt, and they've always done it with a smile. Nut allergies? No problem. They'll take all precautions necessary to ensure your dish is safe.  You'll have to set your budget a little higher here, especially if you plan on ordering one of their famous deserts ($7-8) but it will be worth it.  Points: -If you order a kids meal with fries, ask for no salt on the fries and add it yourself if needed.  -The tuna tataki salad is amazing, ask for the dressing on the side.  -Like carbonara? Substitute shrimp for chicken, you won't regret it! -I'm not one for skinny dishes but try their skinny chicken pot pie, it's not lacking anything and is a healthier choice than most.  -The banana cream cheesecake is my number one choice, super light with a fluffy/creamy filling that will satisfy you with a smile, even if you're not a fan of banana."
Jeffery L.,"Chicago, IL",452,119,67,2.0,2/24/2017,"So the fun thing about this place is, it's always busy. Parking is available nearby with the connection to the mall, and there is valet parking as well should you need it. I know this place is renowned for its cheesecake, but since I don't like cheesecake, I cannot comment on that. The establishment itself looks like every other Cheesecake Factory, kind of like a modern-ish church feel with a bar thrown in there. Personally, I find it far too loud, but that's because it's busy because it surprises me - The food here is pretty much in my opinion like recooked leftovers, or if you want to bump it up just a tad, like gourmet airline food. I've been here nearly 5 or 6 times in the past few years and each time from the food to the service (or serious lack of) it gets progressively worse. The only thing I see as a perk here is the outdoor seating on nice weather, it's definitely a nice location. But that's about it. You are far better off trying perhaps Maggiano's across the street or even the Pour House. Definitely overcrowded, understaffed (at times), overcooked and definitely overrated. Quality is not a strong suit for the establishment that allows for them to have the prices that they've set. They are losing to the competition across the area tenfold as time will surely tell."
Yader H.,"Ontario, CA",13,6,,1.0,9/24/2017,I was really impressed with the decor of this Cheesecake Factory. How ever the service did not March the looks. My gf and I got a seat at the bar about 920 pm . Our server was Paulina. She did her normal greeting in the beginning but we did not see her for about 45 minutes after the fact we asked for the usual. Bread and water. We felt like she was more interested in her co workers being off then providing service for us . I hope she reads so she understands there are no hard feelings but take some pride in your service no matter how it is you feel thanks
Mila N.,"Elmhurst, IL",1,23,7,4.0,7/9/2017,"Went here last night and it was pretty good. Service was great and food was pretty good. Tried a few different things. The calarmari was pretty good, just wished it was marinara sauce instead of cocktail sauce, just because that's my preference. We also tried the stuffed mushrooms, which were amazing. Then we had the NY strip steak entree with mashed potatoes and asparagus. The asparagus were perfectly cooked and the mashed potatoes were delicious. The steak was average, we asked for medium and seemed more medium rare. We didn't have room for desserts but we did get drinks. I had the Mai tai which was okay, but to my preference it was too strong but was very pretty looking. Then my boyfriend had just a cranberry vodka(grey goose) double shot, short, and he was impressed as they served it perfectly.  The service was real good though, and overall interested to go again to try different things on the menu."
Mary S.,"Elmhurst, IL",0,1,,2.0,1/7/2018,"My husband and I and our two teenagers visited the Oakbrook Cheesecake Factory yesterday around 2:15 for lunch.  We rarely can all get together for lunch with busy schedules so this was a treat.  Or at least we were hoping it would be.  Wait was 20 minutes, just as host said.  We placed our orders and were waiting quite a long time, but it was packed so we tried to be patient.  A food carrier brought my husband's sandwich and my sons.  No one came with my daughter or mine.  Server didn't come over but a few minutes later Manager came over and she said they made me the wrong entree.  I asked what they made and said I would just take it.  Waited another 4-5 minutes and she brought me the wrong entree which was good.  In the meantime, my daughter didn't get anything, and my sons burger which was supposed to be medium well came rare.  He was so hungry from waiting he said I'm eating it anyway when we told him to send it back.  Still no food for my daughter.  Both guys were finished and server finally brought my daughter's food with no apology whatsoever.  So she ate all by herself.  3 out of four of our orders were wrong.  I have been a server myself and that's not how its done.  I would have definately comped my daughters or offered a dessert or something.  But we didn't even get an apology from server.  We always like Cheescake factory but it's off our list now."
Melanie H.,"West Chicago, IL",1,1,,1.0,12/11/2017,"I hate it. First of all girl let me tell you. I walked in okay then I sat my ass down and ordered my food. It was all pretty good. Honestly best food I've ever had. But then when the lady came back to check up on me she took my plate and asked if I wanted a dessert, of course I said yes. But hold up... they had no cheesecake. What time of joke is this???? You're gonna have a restaurant called the Cheesecake Factory with cheesecake in the name yet not have any???? I'm very disappointed and I will never be going back. Very mad."
Khawla A.,"Elmwood Park, IL",70,26,40,2.0,7/1/2017,"I used to not like cheesecake, then I came back after 3 years. I ordered the miso salmon with roasted beets instead of the rice. I came back again and it wasn't the same. They lack consistency and the food often comes out cool. The service isn't bad and the environment is nice! Just wish they were more consistent. Sadly, not worth the wait. (This picture is from the first time I went back)"
Mary A.,"Chandler, AZ",69,29,15,5.0,6/23/2017,Veronica Was 200% On It~!  Her Service Was Above And Beyond~!  Food Was Made To Order But Service Is Why I'll Be Back~!  Thank You Veronica For Making Our Adventure Phenomenol~!
Crystal B.,"Chicago, IL",5,17,13,1.0,5/30/2017,"Worst experience of my life at a Cheesecake Factory. The recipe for my meal had been ""updated"" however, there were no updates of such changes on the menu. I had to send the food back twice and ultimately resorted to not eating. My waiter was annoyed and not engaging. The manager seemed uninformed and indifferent about the situation as well. I'll never come back to this location again. I hope that no one else gets treated as poorly as I have."
Brad R.,"Downers Grove, IL",54,43,23,4.0,8/1/2017,The food was really great for a corporate chain. The waitress gave us one word responses at best.  Sometimes she just tried to ignore us.  I find comedy in everything so we still enjoyed dinner.  I think the aircraft carrier size floor might wear servers out quick. Have a better day tomorrow.
Mia R.,"Chicago, IL",1,17,2,1.0,6/26/2017,"Shout out to Peter! He was an awesome waiter, very friendly. We came in to celebrate a very special holiday and he made us feel good.  The people at the cheesecake section were so so so rude ! ! ! They were very unprofessional . We waited about 25 minutes JUST to order 2 cheesecakes. I do understand they were busy but when there were about 8 employees there not one of them greeted us or told us they would be right with us. When they did decide to help they were so rude , almost like we were bothering them . They really need to get it together. It doesn't matter if how nice the restaurant is because at the end of the day if their customer service is terrible people will not return. We won't be going back there ever again. Unfortunately customer service overall sucked , with the exception of Peter."
Rachel H.,"Chicago, IL",23,126,235,4.0,6/20/2017,"You really can't go wrong here. I swear they have to have one of the, if not the lengthiest menus. I mean it's a book! For some all the options can be overwhelming but, you will always find something on it to suit your taste buds I am sure. It's also always packed and usually a 30-40 minute wait on the weekends to be seated because this place is great for groups and special occasions. I enjoy the bar area to eat honestly, and it's typically first come first serve and not always crowded. I have had so many items off the menu over the years, but my favorites are the shrimp scampi and the firecracker salmon rolls. I literally some days stop in just for the salmon rolls! They're so tasty and crispy. The spicy chili sauce that comes with it is delicious too! The shrimp scampi comes with huge butterfly lightly battered shrimp that sit and swim in a linguine pasta sauce with garlic and butter and is oh so doggone good!! These dishes have never disappointed and honestly I don't think there has ever been a time I have been dissatisfied with a dish here. Some people are not into the big chain style restaurants, but I must admit this one here has proven itself over the years to be consistent with great food and great service. Their cheesecake is on another level of cheesecake. I mean like on the level you not sharing!! (lol), and I guess that is why the entire restaurant is named after it. I can eat their cheesecake all day everyday and not get tired of it. Always fresh, made as you order and come in every flavor you can think of. The strawberry is my favorite. Something about big, firm, fresh, sweet, juicy strawberry's on top of a cheesecake you just cannot get enough of. The drinks are pretty good too. My favorites are the Georgia Peach and the Strawberry Martini. My only pet-peeved here is they do not list the drink prices on their menu, which I don't understand why they do not? They list the prices of the food in the menu, so why not the drinks? If I am ordering a drink I surely wanna know how much it cost and feel silly asking the waiters how much every drink is. Sorry, but not sorry, I am not paying over $13 for no drink from nowhere. The parking on a weekend can get really congested especially since they're in the mall and in the restaurant district as I call it, so they share parking space with like 6 other restaurants, but if no parks let up after circling the parking lots over and over, you can park by Neiman Marcus, there's always  available space over there."
Carol B.,"Conroe, TX",27,5,1,1.0,10/23/2017,"So why would this place have the audacity to charge 19.95 for a pasta dish with 5 PRECOOKED, TOUGH, DRIED OUT, HARD AS ROCK shrimp, with not even a side salad. Need I say, I will NOT BE BACK?  We did however have a great waitress. She is wasting her talent working at this place."
Ricardo F.,"Chicago, IL",0,3,,2.0,12/13/2017,"Called to place an order for cheesecake. Midpoint through the order, informed that unless ordering more food, would not be able to place it and I could just ""walk up to counter and place order, we are not busy"" (right, 6pm, holiday season). Find parking at this place, walk up, wait in line. Complained to attendant, who gave a me free piece of cheesecake and gave my order ahead of everybody else waiting there, not really fair to them. Still a 20min ordeal, and unbelievable to me somebody calling to place a $100 order is interrupted and unable to complete the order. Always an unpleasant experience coming here."
Chris E.,"Lombard, IL",172,19,3,5.0,10/14/2017,"Great service, the server was punctual with the food, and the food was hot and fresh! Defiantly will be returning ! The manager even came to check on us to make sure our food and time was good!"
Tiana M.,"Westmont, IL",12,31,7,3.0,4/15/2017,"I was super excited to come here, especially since I have heard such good reviews for years. Well, I must say that this was not a great experience; food wise or comfortably.  My husband and I were seated next two individuals who did nothing but use fowl language, so I requested for my our seat to be moved. The h Last thing that I wanted to hear on date night was someone cursing in front of children about some man. Well, we we're seated on a booth. Now, I regret asking for my seat to be moved because for  a whole hour we listed to cackling hyenas. My goodness we wanted to rip our ears off.  The food,  considering the portion size we were okay with the price. But, it was NOT good, my husband ordered the shrimp in which he said was not seasoned and tastes funny so he pretty much trashed it, I ordered fettuccini with chicken and added broccoli, this was only because for me it was the simplest thing on the menu that was already overwhelming. Well, it must have been complicated because it was over cooked and the broccoli was hard, the chicken rubbery and overall flavorless as much salt as I put on there it was still bland. The only thing okay that I ordered was the sprite and the long island.  Will I come back, NO! Very disappointed all the way around. Actually other than the waitress Elsie and Katie."
Susan F.,"Romeoville, IL",3,54,,1.0,6/4/2017,"This restaurant/location has been a family favorite for years, until yesterday. Our daughter had chosen to eat here for her birthday. We always try to get there a little ahead of the dinner crowd so as to not have a long wait. We were seated quickly in a small roundish section on the front edge of the restaurant. There were many tables open in this area and they placed us at a very sunny window. I figured they would drop down some shade if needed. Waiter took our drink order and brought waters quickly, but then it was hard to find him to order appetizers or even our meals. One of the times he came to us, he was holding someone's to go bag the whole time we were ordering. I thought that was a little odd. So as the setting sun was beginning to become a problem for a few of us (and we had mentioned it to our server to no avail) the shades finally began to come down, I could see again! Then just as quickly they went back up. Again something was said to the waiter and again was not interested. And then they came down again, and went back up again. This went on for some time. It was very distracting. (I found out later that it was the table next to us that wanted them up, the shades do not work individually, stupid design and those guests were wearing sunglasses, so why didn't they just sit outside!) BTW the vegetable that came with my dish was snow peas and when I asked to switch them out with asparagus (I love their asparagus!) I was told it would cost extra. Out of the 3 salmon dishes, I was ordering the most expensive as it was and all mine came with was rice and snow peas and they wanted to charge extra for the asparagus! Outrageous, I opted for the snow peas. When my dish came out I then understood why the upcharge. The snow peas, all four of them were garnish, not an actual vegetable, shameful. Now for the real reasons we will never come back. SALT OMG!!! My husband's, and two daughters' pastas were so salty, two of them couldn't eat them at all. My son's mashed potatoes were also inedible with too much salt and pepper. We have eaten here enough times to know this wasn't normal. We said something to the waiter and he brought out only my husband a new plate of pasta, but it too was salty. The manager came out, (he was very nice) and explained that they have to keep a lot of salt in the cooking water for the pasta. Not sure why. But he did nothing to correct anything. I felt really bad for my daughter whose birthday we were there celebrating since it was her pasta that she was unable to eat. Also no birthday celebration at all for her. And after a $335 tab we had to go home and eat something else. Guess we will have to take her somewhere else to celebrate. On a side note, there was a table that was adjacent to us whom they did come out a sing Happy Birthday to, but it was truly pathetic. The staff looked and sounded like they truly didn't want to be there. It was so bad that another table of young girls said a big Happy Birthday and clapped for them at the end, which did help."
