Kytara N.,"Evanston, IL",58,1,,2.0,2/14/2016,"Food was not good at all. Came in for brunch with a friend. Ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes for myself and an omelet to share. The eggs for the ""omelet"" tasted like rubber. The pancakes were meh. The only reasoning I am giving 2 stars is because the waiter was extremely nice and attentive."
Lois K.,"Glen Ellyn, IL",0,6,,3.0,6/14/2016,"Had lunch there today and it was good as usual.  I ordered the steak diane medium rare and it was a little too cooked, but I ate it anyway.  But the thing I am annoyed with today is when I left I decided to order a piece of cheesecake to go at the take out counter.  I waited patiently by myself, there was no one else waiting, but the preparer did not even acknowledge I was there.  She was busy putting together a few orders but not once did she say ""I'll be right with you"" or it will just be a minute"".  Either responses would have been fine.  But after 5 minutes I just left.  Too bad, I really had a taste for a slice of raspberry lemon cheesecake.  Poor service to say the least.  It was 2:45 in the afternoon so they were not slammed at that time."
Paul W.,"Elburn, IL",0,3,,1.0,3/6/2016,"Food quality was okay, taste was marginal. Service average, our server had a piercing voice. When our meal was completed, we decided to take some cheese cake to go. That experience was, well an adventure, told the young lady several times no whip cream, finally got it straight after she prepared 3 of the five slices. Never bothered to acknowledge us thru the whole experience, other then when we paid. In summary, will never go back to any of there locations."
Sam K.,"Chicago, IL",0,7,17,4.0,4/29/2014,"Sunday night, after a show at the Folio Theater, we go the munchies and decided to drop to get a bite to eat.  Nice place, but very dead in traffic.  The staff seemed friendly and the food was good. I had the ribeye, medium, and my better 1/2 had the pasta. Funny thing, the bread, that they give for free, was the best.  I forget way they call it, but I bought some to take home w/ me.  Recommend."
Jennine I.,"Chicago, IL",18,22,3,4.0,9/14/2015,I sent an email to The Cheesecake Factory and within a few days of submitting my email complaint I received a few calls and then a formal letter of apology along with a $25 gift card. 5 stars for trying to make things right.
Mai S.,"Chicago, IL",4,81,,1.0,6/6/2014,"Great food - bad management! We order the Jamaican shrimp & chicken.  They ran out of the black beans as a side, so the waiter offer a substitution.  I was agreeable to this - no issue there. My order came out missing two side items - including the substitution for the black beans.  I waited to get the two side items for another 12-18 mins.  Then the bill came - they charged me extra $$ for the substitution of the black beans!!! I told the manager as I was wondering why the item came out higher than usual?  He corrected for the extra charge - saying he didn't know why the system over charged me. (If he didn't know, how would I know??) If my kid and I didn't review the bill carefully and knew the prices as regular customer, the restaurant would have over charged me for their multiple mistakes and shortage of the regular item. Three mistakes on the same item - yet no offer to discount or an offer of slice of desert!?? No apology by management! This was ridiculous - I should file with the BBB for the erroneous charges to the customer.  The food is great!  Service - always sub par!!! I would try another venue!"
Tia B.,"Chicago, IL",99,249,220,3.0,6/13/2014,"What can be said about Cheesecake Factory that hasn't already been said? It's a chain restaurant with a cluttered menu and the cheesecake is so-so.  You have to be really hungry to eat at this particular Cheesecake to put up with the wait (you'll wait at least 30 minutes when their are empty tables everywhere), the parking situation is crazy. You're fighting for parking spaces because there are no less than 3 other restaurants sharing the same lot. And don't get me started on the slow service. The staff has no sense of urgency to greet you or bring water or bread.  Save yourself the stress. If you really need a cheesecake fix just get it to go and be in and out in about 5 minutes."
Luke N.,"Bolingbrook, IL",0,5,6,5.0,4/8/2015,"excellent! best restaurant i've eaten in my life! amazing service , unbelievable food, and peaceful ambience! i recommend their stuffed mushrooms, fried calamari, and a burger! even better if you substitute the burgers beef with kobe. after get a cheesecake of your choice. i've eaten here for about 12 times in my life ! keep up the good work!"
Beach P.,"Chicago, IL",0,31,5,4.0,2/20/2016,"Cheesecake is pretty standard across the spectrum of their restaurants and the one in Oak Brook is no different. Fantastically large, diverse menu, incredible cheesecake options. Service has always been good at this location. Main issue here is wait times. This is a very busy location and we have passed it on many times because the line is out the door, even in the snow!"
Deanna D.,"Lombard, IL",73,199,326,3.0,6/10/2014,"This is the restaurant to choose to please the whole crowd. The savory menu is vast and varied: fish, fowl, burgers, pizza, pasta, eggs, sandwiches, salads, steaks & chops, comfort food,  Asian-inspired, Tex-Mex, fried stuff with cheese. It's All-American and wrapped up in an eye-popping, technicolor, Egypt meets theme park package. And then there's cheesecake. Lots and lots of cheesecake. Cheesecake-On-Ice. There are, at minimum, two dozen types of cheesecake from plain to fruity to decadent chocolate. Ever wonder what is meant by the phrase gilding the lily? The answer is: The Cheesecake Factory cheesecake. Whipped cream is not enough for these people! They must stuff it with candy, or maybe stir in booze, or sprinkle it with chips or streusel, or top it with frosting. They layer it with cake, or brownies, or fresh fruit. If you're a person who, when it comes to desserts, believes more is more; then The Cheesecake Factory is for you! The sweets don't stop with cheesecake either. Oh heavens no! There are ice cream sundaes, cakes, tortes, milkshakes, and tiramisu. Now I know I just called this place a crowd-pleaser, but that does not mean it tops my personal list of restaurants. Although the food is good and I've never had any dish here to complain about, it isn't great. The Cheesecake Factory's strength is variety. You can please the kids, the grandparents, and the vegetarians all in one place. For me, the entire concept from decor to menu is over-the-top. Sensory overload. Too many menu items. Too many embellishments. Too much noise. Too many people. Too many tables too close together. Too many smells. No, seriously! Try enjoying your cheesecake on a not-exactly-clean table only a foot away from neighboring tables eating fish and pasta. It's too much for me. I'm much more likely to drop by for a slice of cheesecake to take home. But then again, if I've got a big group to feed with varied tastes and of various ages, I will likely consider The Cheesecake Factory."
L K.,"Naperville, IL",0,18,13,1.0,1/9/2017,"My family waited an hour and a half (were told wait time would be 45-50 minutes when we checked in). Were seated at a nice table towards the back. Our server was very nice brought our drinks and bread right away she was the best part of our experience. I ordered fish tacos I have had them before but this time they were awful just a friend piece of fish in a tortilla with barely any salsa and they forgot the slaw. The side of lime on the plate was all dried up and the Rice and beans were both cold like they were just taken out of the refrigerator. My husband had the enchiladas it looked like a plate of slop covered heavily with cilantro. He said they were tasteless. My daughter ordered the chicken Madeira she said the chicken was rubbery, the mashed potatoes were cold and she mentioned the sauce was very salty. My other daughter had the chicken bellagio which our server said was amazing, needless to say I could tell by the few bites she ate it was far from it. My mom ordered the Cuban sandwich when I asked her how it was she said it was fine. It has been awhile since we have been to Cheesecake Factory and after the long wait it was a big disappointment. They are a quantity food establishment not quality."
Cara G.,"Wheaton, IL",0,20,3,3.0,3/8/2015,I like Cheesecake Factories.. This is the same as all the other. Cant beat their cheesecake! If you've never had them.. Try the Fried Mac n' Cheese balls!
Yvonne B.,"Chicago, IL",383,866,1948,2.0,6/29/2012,"When I was a small, going to McDonald's was a treat. Now it makes me feel sick. Then, when I was in my early 20s and didn't know better, TGI Friday's was my FAVORITE restaurant. At that time, going to the Cheesecake Factory was a big ooh la la deal. I considered the Cheesecake Factory to be high class fancy. Not so much anymore. Now I just think it's overrated. The super high ceilings, murals, and lighting are reminiscent of a banquet hall or ballroom; however, that's in stark contrast to their booths and regular tables. The servers do their jobs. Nothing more and nothing less. It's not exceptional. At one point I wandered around looking for a bathroom and it took several employees passing me by before one kind soul gave me any kind of direction. The food is okay, although I only got dessert during my most recent visit. My buddy got cheesecake (which he loved!) and I got a Tres Leches Milk Shake. The milk shake was super caramel-y and super sticky sweet for my taste. It was also so huge that I hardly devoured a quarter of it before I brought it to my fridge at home. I might visit The Cheesecake Factory at the Oak Brook Mall if I happen to be there for something else (e.g. shopping); however, I don't think I would seek it out just because. I mean, heck - there's even better restaurants at the mall. I might only head over to the Cheesecake Factory if I want dessert."
Jayve M.,"Elmhurst, IL",2,62,23,4.0,8/19/2015,"I never dine in there before but, ordered cheesecake to go. They have so many types of cheesecake, it be ridiculous to attempt to try every flavor they have. I like the Godiva, S'more, and Tuxedo cheesecake the best. It's well packaged and literally make it look like the actual product when comparing to ad on tv or magazine compared to other places. The place is artsy and high class and floors are even amazing and matches with the scenery. It is very pricey and good for like a special weekend or event out. Also its in the  Mall area, so you could get your shopping done around there too."
Kristy R.,"Carol Stream, IL",0,37,16,2.0,7/25/2016,"Very disappointed at this location.  My niece and I went here for her birthday lunch to the Oak Brook location and after our visit I will never come back to this location.  Let's face it, cheesecake factory Ain't cheap, so when I go I spend a lot of money and expect good service!  our waitress did not write down our order at all she needed to ask us again while speaking loudly kitty corner from the computer to order our food.  She didn't even take the time to come to our table personally to ask our order again.  I ordered the Chicken California avocado club and got just that, minus the avocado.  So I spoke to the waitress explaining I ordered the Chicken California club and her response was ""oh really, let me go get you some avocado.""  I just wanted her to take the sandwich back and give me what I ordered but instead she gave me avocado to put on my sandwich.  The waitress stated that it's the same thing I just need to put the avocado on myself.  I would've preferred the sandwich be made completely over, this is the Cheesecake Factory not Steak N' Shake.  Our waitress was just different to begin with, even my 15 year old niece was like what's wrong with her.  I'll stick to the Schaumburg location, never had an issue there."
Patrick J.,"Chicago, IL",46,257,345,4.0,8/17/2014,"Can't go wrong with the cheesecake factory. However I like their sister store. "" The GrandLux ""the best. Large portions and of course the cheesecake. Craig's outrageous is what I'm having today. The best if you have a later group to order a bunch of appetizers and share this will fill you up. Sharing is what makes the world work. :)"
Len M.,"Villa Park, IL",107,19,17,5.0,10/27/2014,"Great service, nice atmosphere, amazing food. Perfect meal. The Salmon Grnovese was the best salmon dish I've ever had. Natasha had the California Chresesteak Sandwich. She was going to take some home, but I guess it was too good!  Eat outside if you can."
Chuey C.,"Norridge, IL",121,3,,1.0,6/14/2016,Terrible service. The waitress never addressed us. Had to get up and get my own drinks. Total Bulls**t! Never coming here again better service at McDonald's. They at least say Thank you.
Janice L.,"Oak Lawn, IL",0,2,,5.0,7/13/2016,"I don't write many reviews but I didn't want to miss an opportunity to say thank you to Eddie our server today. 9 siblings and spouses who live in different states and don't get to see each other very often had a wonderful meal together.  We never felt rushed even though we took up a large table during the busy lunch hour.  He was attentive, pleasant, patient and even lined us up for a great family photo. Every one of us loved our meal (and we are fussy). Thank you Eddie and Cheesecake Factory for a wonderful day!"
Maria R.,"Glen Ellyn, IL",120,61,284,4.0,7/26/2014,I love the cheese cakes here. They are good and the portion size is big. It helps that the kids like the food here. I hate the wait but what do u want for good food.
