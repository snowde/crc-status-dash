Steven C.,"Chicago, IL",2,22,8,5.0,9/5/2016,"Can't get better value than Cheesecake Factory. I had the Louisiana Chicken Pasta, which had a kick to it without being spicy. Their avocado eggroll appetizer is a must have as well! Amazing staff and great time as always. On a Saturday night, we had to wait ~20-25 min for a table since they don't take reservations."
Carlos T.,"Chicago, IL",39,74,7,5.0,6/8/2016,"Went here with my wife on anniversary night. On Thursday evening it was pretty packed. Luckily it only took 15 mins to get seated. Going there for the first time it was a great night. Peter was our server. He was great, serving us greatly. The food was good too. The fettuccine Alfredo and Five or Four cheese pasta was good too. Large portion size. The original and Hershey cheesecake were the bomb. The best desert I have had at a restaurant. Service 5/5 Food 5/5 Ambiance 5/5"
Shany K.,"Chicago, IL",242,1,,1.0,12/24/2016,Very disappointed with tonight's service. We were seated 15 minutes later than said. Ignored for the first 15 after being seated. No waitress came to take our order. The check from previous customer was left on the table. The silverware was dirty. We were not provided bread or drinks until we asked for it.
Ana C.,"Oak Brook, IL",9,8,,5.0,8/31/2017,Best waiter ever! We had 13 people in our group and he handled us beautifully. The food came out together. Drinks stayed filled. Extremely professional and courteous. The food was very good. My favorite location so far.
Love And Happiness I.,"Chicago, IL",11,53,5,2.0,3/31/2017,"Well this place ""use"" to be great...now it's hit & miss.  The last 2 x's (this year) I was at this place there were issues...both times the silverware was dirty & one of those times the waitress forgot to put my daughters meal order in.  I hope they get it together but in any event I won't b back."
Tangie W.,"Chicago, IL",43,38,4,2.0,6/6/2016,"I was disappointed,  I used to love the cheesecake Factory and my favorite dish WAS the pasta cajun jambalaya . The dish wasn't even  to the rim of the bowl , the noodles were thinner 3 shrimp lots of chicken. Won't order again . Cheesecake slices were soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo  small for $8. Greatly DISAPPOINTED! !!!!!!!!"
ray b.,"Plainfield, IL",1,84,5,5.0,2/17/2017,"It has been quite awhile since my family has eaten here so I honestly could not recall my last experience. In short the restaurant was beautiful, our waiter was awesome and the food was delicious."
Nina B.,"Chicago, IL",50,267,205,4.0,7/26/2015,"I met friends for lunch and really enjoyed myself. I wasn't quite sure if it was the place for us, because we tend to gab for awhile but the Cheesecake Factory was... what can I say... upscale gabbing.  We all initially ordered an appetizer to share. Everything was very tasty. The calamari was great, (of course, how could you go wrong), and the avocado egg rolls - magnificent! The pot stickers were ok. I ordered the Chinese chicken salad lunch portion, which was good and more than enough - half went home to son three; so I could have room for dessert. It's too bad my friends and I don't get together more often, however, truly, our visits are a foretaste of Heaven as are the desserts at the Cheesecake Factory. So worth eating half your meal.  How do they make their cheesecakes so great looking? And taste... like not of this world - a foretaste! Why four stars? Our server.  My friends and I look and act like older, matured women - not ""girls"", (or older, matured women looking to recapture youth - we are all fine with our advanced age). It's not a complement/flattering to be constantly referred to as a girl, seemingly with the intent to make us feel ""younger""- it seemed out of place. It would be like the pharmacist calling me ""sweetie"". NOT! Just weird."
Ht L.,"Chicago, IL",1,21,11,3.0,8/22/2015,"Met up with my friends in Oakbrook for dinner at The Cheesecake Factory - always a great place to dine at.  The atmosphere is always upbeat and the cheesecake selection is plenty big for every kind of mood you can imagine.  That said; I would have given them 5 stars but instead gave them a 3 stars rating because of the service we got from our waitress. After self-parking our car and walking in to the restaurant, we were greeted politely by the Valet Parker, even though we did not want to pay him $4 to park our car.  The hostess and the manager greeted us and sat us at our table in less than 2 minutes, but then again, we came at around 5:15 pm - a great time to avoid the dinner crowd, which normally comes after 6:00 pm on a Friday night. When our waitress came over to greet us and got our drink and appetizer orders, she quickly returned with the drinks and later, the Thai Lettuce Wraps - SUPER YUMMY!  From there, everything went down hill fast in terms of service.  Like most people, we made a mess eating our appetizers because the lettuce was dripping with sauces on the table - talk about finger ""licking"" good!  After she took away our appetizers, she didn't even bother to clean the table - which was clearly messy and visible by everyone.  How can you not see the sauce all over the table and not even wipe it down????? We all decided to wait and see what she would do next, and sure enough, she came back with our dinner plates and served them on top of the messy table without blinking an eye - UNBELIEVABLE!!!!  Then she cleared the table of dirty dishes and still didn't even clean the ""new mess"" on top of the ""old mess.""  After all that said, we ordered dessert and waited for her to bring out our cheesecakes, and you guess it, she served them on the dirty table - WOW!!!! Given the price point for this restaurant, you would expect better trained waiters / waitresses, but I guess management did not care.  To be honest, I've had much better services from ""fast-casual"" restaurants then here.  The bottom line, I would recommend The Cheesecake Factory for their atmosphere and food quality, but good ""Customer Service"" needs improvement quickly!"
P J.,"Chicago, IL",0,11,,1.0,5/27/2017,Their cheese cakes may be the best but their customer service is among the most arrogant. I would never dine there again after my husband got scolded by the front desk lady. She failed to buzz us when it was our turn to have a table and then  spoke harshly to us when we questioned about it. The food may be worth the long wait but their service ain't.
Jaclyn F.,"Oak Brook, IL",0,49,,3.0,2/15/2017,"My man and I go here once in awhile and we get okay service. Food always good, but they servers we had a few times we had gone were too slow to get to us and too slow to bring the food out."
Ronald Y.,"Oak Park, IL",3,70,44,2.0,9/27/2015,"I've got to admit, they have good cheesecake... It's just good though. I've had cheesecake that was creamier and the choices are so endless and over complicated even deciding is frustrating. The reason for the low score is that I think everyone involved is just so overwhelmed. The service was good, almost too good to be real. Our servers constantly used psychologically suggestive phrases like ""Is everything still delicious?"" And everything we ordered was ""an awesome choice.""  In terms of food, it was fine but I can almost taste the chain restaurant-ness. Dishes offered single dimensions that you'd expect from places you don't pay $15 a plate."
Karen B.,"Maywood, IL",34,1,,2.0,4/17/2017,"Usually pretty good food.  However, I was just there on Saturday April 15 at 3pm and while they were busy, I have seen it much, much worse. So imagine my displeasure at the nachos that were so overbaked they were brown; a drizzle of cheese and 3 jalapeno slices. (I should have taken a picture). And my son ordered a steak well done and it arrived medium. The waiter tried to justify it by saying the meat next to the bone is always pink. First, not true. Second, the pink piece was cut from the opposite side. We requested a credit on the bill and the nachos were made over and this time they were perfect.  But the celebration experience was already ruined by the meal."
Susie C.,"Forest Park, IL",106,496,254,3.0,5/11/2015,"My family and I came here for dinner on a Saturday evening...around 5pm. It was already a lot of people, and we had a wait time of 1.5 hours before we could get a table for 6 people. It was Mother's Day weekend, so the wait time may have been increased. We were able to walk around the mall during this 1.5 hours, so we didn't have to sit around and wait at Cheesecake. They give you a buzzer that they say the mall is within range.  Onto the food - we ordered few appetizers - cobb salad (which was VERY good - it was everyone's favorite), texmex egg rolls (I really enjoyed it), Salmon Firecrackers (ehh a little boring), and Southern Fried Chicken sliders which were okay. For entree I had the pasta with shrimp and sausage. It's rigatoni pasta with spicy peppers, Italian Sausage, and Shrimp. I really like the sauce. It was good. My husband had their pasta dish with Chicken which he thought was okay. My mom had their steak Diane and salmon combo..she did not enjoy her steak too much - she said it was a bit too burnt. My sister had a pasta dish and she thought it was okay. My grandma had the salmon dish. She didn't say much. My mom-in-law had their steak - she like the flavors but also thought the steak was too burnt. We ended the evening with one slice of the fresh strawberry cheesecake. I thought it was good, but everyone else said it was just average. Overall - decent food, big menu and lots of selections. Service was just okay - they were very busy so we had to wait awhile for our waitress to come.  They also do not take reservations on weekends, only weekdays."
Kinda M.,"Shrewsbury, MA",1,14,1,1.0,4/27/2017,"The service is so bad, they will not hear what you are asking for such as a table far from kitchen or bathrooms even though the place was empty!! The food was terribly delivered to our table, we ordered the 3 small burgers as an appetizer and there were so greasy and placed in a tiny plate on top of each other and looked discussing.. same for the rest of the food as if they were in a rush and throw the food on the plate. Very disappointing branch."
Wallace F.,"Naperville, IL",9,20,,5.0,7/7/2017,"Loooved their food and service; wait times are VERY long but definitely worth the wait (depending on the day, you can get reservations, I went on a Sunday and they were not taking reservations so it was first come first serve so the wait was an hour). Food is delicious and there is a huge variety of plates to select (pasta, vegetarian, steak, seafood, chicken, gluten-free, etc). It is also pricey (not surprising: downtown Chicago is always pricey) and if you want dessert it is at a minimum $10 that you would pay for dessert, so you can imagine the price of the rest of the plates, BUT it is SO worth the delicious food and I had a wonderful time with my family admiring the theme of the restaurant (very Alice in Wonderland) and chatting with each other on a Sunday evening and that was worth the money and time I wasted getting a table there."
Julie S.,"Carbondale, IL",12,46,18,1.0,4/2/2016,Next time you want cheesecake just go to the dessert counter order your slice and leave. Service was terrible. Over priced menu. Never got the drinks we ordered. Took over an hour from the time we were seated to get a salad and tacos. She never came back to check on us either. There were ingredients in my salad that weren't there and added ingredients that weren't on the menu. The black beans served with the tacos were cold. The cheese cake was delicious!
Frank K.,"Oak Brook, IL",0,4,,5.0,7/26/2017,"Wide variety of outstanding choices, excellent service, most accommodating, knowledgeable & outgoing workers, clean & beautiful atmosphere.  Always a pleasurable experience for my immediate & extended family.  My daughter with autism always requests to go here.  It's her favorite restaurant!!!!"
Dj D.,"Brookfield, IL",0,11,1,1.0,7/15/2017,where do i start ? the hostess was rude from the beginning ! hello! she should realize she is the first people see when they come in ! lastly my wife went to the bathroom and it was a mess!!! that was the last straw! we left !
Rem V.,"Chicago, IL",0,13,1,1.0,7/19/2016,"This restaurant is probably the absolute worst that I've gone to (and I've gone to ALOT).  The service was very poor. We were first seated by the air conditioning and when we asked to move, our waitress said ""She'll deal with you,"" and handed us off to another waitress. Silverware still had remnants of food and crumbs on them, which grossed us out extremely. The stuffed tater tots were very good going down, but an hour after the meal they gave me a hearty stomachache. The Colby burger tasted just like any other McDonald's burger, which is the opposite of what you'd expect considering the price. The fettuccine alfredo was similar to the tater tots: very rich and creamy going down, but not very good an hour after the meal. We also had to wait 40+ minutes for our meal, which quite frankly is unacceptable for the quality of the food and service we received. I do not recommend at all."
