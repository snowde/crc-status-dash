Alex A.,"Chicago, IL",1742,261,2716,4.0,2/28/2015,"I really love to hate corporate places. I prefer to give my money to one-off or ma and pa businesses. This is not to say that the latter are always hits and the former duds. No...there must be something to (most) corporate/chain places that made them such a success in the first place. Cheesy Factory, that's what I call it, has a winning formula. They're huge, the cheesecake is actually really good, their usually pretty slick and professional with reservations, seating, service, etc. And the food is actually pretty dayum good. And we're talking a, what? 15 page menu here? How do they do it. My guest told me their kitchen has a zillion staff and it's a little nuts in there. I believe it. How they can keep all those ingredients fresh or make sense of a lunch rush of tickets coming I don't know but they do. I had a lunch miso salmon over brown rice with spring peas. It was cooked perfectly and very succulent with - let's use the word - umami. My pineapple Moscow mule was excellent if a bit sweet. Guest tends to get the build your own Asian lettuce wraps and she built me one and it was delicioso. The presentation on that one is really phenom too. I mean this place even plates stuff upscale. Not bad. I'm gigging Cheesy Factory a star, however, for having $__.95 prices. It's not $15.95, it's $16. Have a level of class as befits your food. I hate that _.99 or _.95 thing! AND...even tackier, that one's minor...ads in your glossy print menu. I mean, granted, most CFs are at malls so it kinda makes sense...but damn. I hate a picture menu and I hate one with ads even mo'. 'Nuff said."
Tess V.,"Glen Ellyn, IL",0,5,2,2.0,7/13/2017,30-40 minute estimated wait turned into an hour 20 minutes. Understandable because the table they had planned for us stayed longer than anticipated but they couldn't have pushed two tables together earlier than DOUBLE our wait time? Food was amazing as always but they didn't do anything to make up for the wait
Margaret A.,"Melrose Park, IL",0,13,,2.0,3/28/2017,An extremely popular place. I don't know why. Way overpriced. Cold  fries. Friendly waiter . Assured us the turkey in the turkey club was roasted turkey not deli turkey but it wasn't. The club sandwich looked thrown together. Cut pieces missing bacon  or lettuce or turkey. I get a much more beautiful put together club sandwich at Rainbow in Elmhurst or even Yorkys on York Road for way less than this  place.   Not going back.
Christopher P.,"Oswego, IL",0,39,9,1.0,2/14/2016,"I am so disappointed in the Cheesecake Factory.  I've been a fan for years and has been a staple for my wife and I whether it be for lunch, dinner and just stopping in for one of their many fabulous cheesecakes.  Yesterday my wife and I ordered cheesecake to go for a Valentine's Day treat and normally their slices were historically enough to feed more than one which makes sense given the price.  When we got our slices, they were so small, less than half the size of their to-go containers.  So disappointed."
Jennifer P.,"Chicago, IL",5,25,4,5.0,2/2/2016,"Food is always great and the staff is particularly good at this locatoon.  Food-wise fried mac and cheese balls, barbecue ranch chicken salad, Jamaican black pepper shrimp, and habatchi steak are my top picks.  Brandy was an excellent server! One of the best we've had at cheesecake. Lidia at the bar was also very helpful and kept checking up on us and offering water long after my drink was done.  Always a great experience here!"
maria r g.,"Chicago, IL",11,45,,4.0,5/19/2017,"Had a great time waitress suggested a drink based on my likings. Very tasty, my grandson was not having a good day and they were very accommodating very kid friendly! Dinner was mouth watering and very good. Dessert was extremely good remember it's Cheesecake Factory ."
Natalia S.,"Villa Park, IL",174,46,36,4.0,2/8/2016,"Came here with my 2 y/o daughter. The staff was very friendly, though the hostess could smile a bit. Fancy entry, large in size when you walk in. Immediately saw the cheesecakes and teddy Bears. When we got sat down, host asked if my daughter wanted a ""kid"" plate... With bananas and chopped up bread. Free of charge. Score. Kept her occupied for a bit. No crayons here. They do offer a kids menu. One waitress even brought over her highlighters and pen pad to keep my daughter occupied while our slow waiter came back.  Awesome service on her end. No - it's not all about cheesecakes!  From burgers to pasta.... Big menu selection. Pricey pastas. Spent over $17 on one dish... Holy smackers! I did have left overs, probably from eating the delicious bread & butter they served beforehand. It was delicious though. It had FARFALLE chicken, mushroom, peas, garlic.. I added brocolli. Loved it. Taste great the next day when reheated.  Also ordered cheesecake, Chris outrageous. Has coconut, chocolate, all that jazz. Was a big piece, had left overs as well. Split between 2 1/2 people.  Bummed when I saw the bill and it cost $8 just for the slice... Ouch. High prices. Good food. Fair portions. Good service. Busy. Oh, and the manager or owner offered my daughter whipped cream in a bowl - out of kindness."
Lenore L.,"Stickney, IL",0,4,,5.0,7/1/2017,"We had an absolutely DELICIOUS lunch/dinner, at the Cheesecake Factory, in Oak Brook today!!!!  Salmon, Chicken and Steak....mmm...mmm....GREAT!!!!!  LOVE THE AMBIANCE and DAKOTA, our waiter, was THE BEST!!!!!  It was my Auntie Terry's B-Day and he certainly made sure that EVERYTHING WAS PERFECT!!!!!  We will be back very soon!!! Thumbs up for a GREAT TIME!!!!"
Ashley A.,"Chicago, IL",0,21,45,5.0,6/27/2016,"Amazing service, food was really great and would most definitely recommend this place and this location is particular is really big and they even give the option to dine outside in a patio which is really nice too."
Ann J.,"Villa Park, IL",0,8,2,2.0,6/20/2017,"We were here for Father's Day dinner and it was after the dinner rush, about 8:30 pm. We didn't have to wait for a seat (it was busy at the time though) so that was a plus. The waiter brought us our bread but we had no plates to eat on. He brought us our alcoholic drinks pretty quickly but failed to bring my daughter's Sprite which I had to ask again for along with plates. Appetizer came, still no plates. Finally, the young lady that brought out our food brought us some plates. Rather than taking our order before the appetizers, he waited until we were done with them to take the order. Meanwhile, we are watching people with other waiters/waitresses, place their orders, get their food, finish their food, all while we wait. Once the food came, and the young lady that brought them out was asking who had what, our waiter finally decides that it's a good time to interrupt her and see if we wanted another alcoholic drink. Very rude and disrespectful to the server trying to give the customer their meal. The food itself was fantastic. The wait time was less than pleasant. Our waiter just kind of ruined the entire experience. This isn't the first time I've experienced less than stellar service at this location. It may be time to find a new Cheesecake Factory to go to."
Kimberley W.,"Indianapolis, IN",28,24,2,3.0,10/21/2016,Food was wonderful service was not to good the poor waitress had a large party that took priority...
Tracy L.,"Lisle, IL",71,22,,2.0,2/14/2016,"I ate at this location for the second time last week. I was unimpressed, other than the pretty interior and tasty (expensive cheesecake) it was just an average experience. 1. Our waiter smelled like cigarette smoke  2. Cheeseburger, cheese just slipped right off burger and fell on plate 3. For $30 something  (including Tip), I expect something more."
Padma A.,"Chicago, IL",104,560,1329,4.0,5/8/2015,Picking up bday cake. We luv the variety of cheescakes and only dine in for the desserts.
V H.,"Hinsdale, IL",0,13,,1.0,1/10/2017,"I went to order a slice of cheeecake. I stood at the register for at least ten minutes and not one of the four associates addressed me with a hello, one moment please, or let me get someone to assist. The sad part is at least two of the associated we're managers. The person who actually worked in that area was fooling around on the register. She looked me directly in my face and said nothing. Then after she was done with whatever, still no assistance.  A waitress walked up to the register and asked for change as if I wasn't standing there waiting. Finally, she took my order and as she handed me the bag I said ""have a good night"" no reply. I'm not sure what the issue was that day, but I hope it stops."
David C.,"Cincinnati, OH",42,302,21,5.0,12/6/2014,"Gonna let you in on my dirty little secret.  I LOVE Cheesecake Factory and have since they first opened their doors.  This one in Oak Brook is no exception: great food all day long, end of story.   For the unenlightened, EVERY SINGLE ITEM on Cheesecake's menu is made from scratch in their kitchens.  Their salad dressings?  Scratch.  Meats, veggies, cheesecakes?  Scratch.  Soups? Yes, scratch.  I could eat at Cheesecake 4 days a week for the rest of my life and be happy. Great food, great service, just too damn crowded so you have to time it right or you'll be caught in the crush of hungry bellies.   Had soup and salad here yesterday: amazing New England clam chowder (do I have to say it?), and tossed salad with balsamic vinaigrette.  Winner, as always.  No complaints here, only praise for one of my fave chains in the USA.  Great, great service with a smile, as usual."
Sharita R.,"Romeoville, IL",116,216,404,3.0,4/19/2015,"I hate having to give this place 3 stars because I've been here quite a few times with no issues, but last night's visit had quite a few awful moments. No matter what, if you are visiting on the weekend for dinner expect obscene wait times. I'm talking 60-90 minutes. The place is huge and they do their best for quick turnover, but the wait is unavoidable. There is the option to dine outside, but despite the offer from the hostess, it was just too chilly for that.       I suggest you head to the bar during your wait. To the bartender with the full tattoo sleeves-you rock and you made the rest of the evening tolerable. My martini was delicious and the sample of that ice cream concoction was awesome! You made sure we had everything we wanted and you made the wait time fly by.      Unfortunately, that was the only highlight of the evening. Our server, although nice, seemed as if she was having an off night. The table next to us that she was serving received the wrong food-she admitted to ringing it up wrong. They were pretty cool with it. She was pretty hard to get a hold of throughout the night as well.       I ordered the jambalaya pasta and my husband ordered the bacon burger. We also started off with Cuban egg rolls as an appetizer. The appetizer was delicious and I was excited for the main course. I received my pasta-the presentation was perfect. And then I started to dig around my dish with my fork. My pasta was pretty much still curled up in spirals and there was no sauce. That's right. No sauce added at all. This dish has a cream Cajun sauce that makes it-tonight there was none to be found. My husband's burger was a bit overcooked and the bacon was extra charred, but he dealt with it and just ate it. The fries also tasted kinda stale to me.     I alerted the waitress about my pasta with no sauce and she offered to bring out sauce or take it back. We had already been waiting quite a while so I just asked for the sauce. Time goes by. I see my waitress come back with no sauce. Apparently it would have to take another 5 minutes on top of the time I had already waited to make some sauce for me. When the sauce finally arrived it just looked like stewed tomatoes in a bowl. No cream sauce to be found. I just took the tepid runny sauce and poured it myself over the pasta-it made the pasta a bit more edible.       Sigh. I usually have quite good experiences at this Cheesecake Factory, but this time I was only left with a disappointing feeling and leftovers that I really didn't want."
Cindy R.,"West Covina, CA",14,3,1,1.0,12/30/2015,"I flew in for the holidays and was excited to go in for a quick meal. As I approached the hostess, I was not greeted or acknowledged. I understand that it was rush hour but the young lady in the front desk had a rude manner of greeting not just me but everyone else. It wasn't till I said something out loud that she started smiling and changing her tone of voice. As a former restaurant employee, the host is the face of the restaurant. They are the first interaction a customer gets, and in this case, this encounter  made me not want to come back. When finally called to be seated, our table was filthy to top it all off. It's unfortunate that this had to happen since I've always liked coming to this location when I was in town."
Kristian R.,"Oak Park, IL",139,42,,4.0,8/16/2016,I have always been a fan of the cheesecake factory. It is by far thee best place to eat just that ... Cheesecake! Do not be fooled they give the absolute best portions of food with a twist. It is a restaurant with a diverse variety of food for fairly reasonable prices. This specific location is always busy so please walk in to reserve a specific time. Parking is limited due to it being in the area of a huge outdoor mall. The service is excellent and I am definitely sure you will receive the same. I would recommend.
Bob A.,"Wheaton, IL",0,31,,5.0,11/15/2016,"Wow, really liked it, and so did the family. Had the orange chicken, and after one bite, said ""This is definitely NOT Panda Express!"". We all had something different, and all loved what we had. Great cheesecake too. Will definitely be back as often as we can."
eric g.,"Springfield, IL",85,3,5,1.0,10/2/2016,I found a piece of plastic wrap in my Rocky Road sundae yesterday. The manager Leo Pearson did nothing for us. Just said that it wasn't up to their standards. I hope so!!!! She could have cared less. She was in a meeting sitting two tables over from us when i asked for the manager. The server went straight to her but it took her 20 minutes to come over non shalantly and ask if everything was ok. She gives The Cheesecake Factory a bad name. Save your money and go somewhere else!
