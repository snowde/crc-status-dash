Zahara S.,"Munster, IN",32,43,2,1.0,10/23/2016,Hair hair everywhere!!!  my sister and I went there for lunch and win the food was delivered there was hair on my plate underneath my food so I waited patiently to flag down the waitress to send it back and I did and the manager came over and said they make me  a new one. But as she  was going to walk away I found another  hair in my cocktail! She offered to make a new one but by that time I was done trying that hairy food. She didn't charge me my meal but she charge my sister for hers when it was just terrible and we shouldn't have been charged. Plain disgusting
Ruth V.,"Chicago, IL",0,2,,1.0,9/27/2016,"Worse service in the world. If you ever want to waste your time, here's the spot! Enjoy!"
Daniel D.,"Riverside, IL",0,6,,2.0,10/16/2016,"Sat outdoors for lunch on a Friday, no wait to get seated. Took 40min for food. Beer I ordered was apparently being refilled so I had to wait. 20min later the waiter came back saying that beer was actually not being refilled, it was finished. Got wine on the house which was good but had to wait an hour while seated to get a meal."
Kristin M.,"Chicago, IL",207,762,879,3.0,12/25/2015,"I had a cheesecake factory giftcard and wanted to go out to dinner the night before Christmas eve to celebrate with my boyfriend and a few friends.  I called ahead of time and tried to make a reservation because I hate to wait.  Their reservation policy is ridiculous.  They told me in order to make a reservation I needed to have over 8 people in my party, have our reservation between 3pm-5pm, contain at least one capital letter/special character, and contain the blood of a virgin.  Ridiculous.  So anyways, no reservations were made and our wait time ended up being about an hour.  Not completely terrible but reservations would of been useful.  Anyways, our waitress was great.  She was able to handle our party of 9 with ease.  I had the Baja chicken tacos and they were ah-maz-ing.  The rice and beans that came with it were nothing special but the tacos made up for it.  The best part of the meal?  They accidently sent me home with two slices of peanut butter cheesecake instead of one.  #winning"
Gilbert M.,"Chicago, IL",79,32,34,1.0,5/31/2016,Terrible service! Waited forever for some bread. We asked four times for them to being bread in between the two servers who switched on us. The kids plates came before any bread which was super hard. I give it one star for the food is actually good.
Cynthia E.,"Downers Grove, IL",287,101,93,3.0,9/24/2015,4 stars for dining here on a weeknight.  2 stars for stopping in for to go dessert on a weekend.  A 20 minute wait for 2 slices of cheesecake to go is ridiculous!  The excuse: the cheesecake area serves the entire restaurant.
Sean T.,"San Antonio, TX",104,252,255,4.0,10/15/2014,I always love this place.  Finally remembering to write a review... I have been to this location on three occasions.   The best thing is their decor and 2 of 3 visits have been on par way above and beyond service with excellent recommendations and knowledge of everything.  My latest visit was a dude which has no bearing except for the fact he was more interested in the two ladies at the table next to us than providing accurate service... Forgetting to bring a drink i had ordered and simple things like straws for drinks.  Everything we had ordered has always been flavorful from the asian salad to crisp won ton tacos to their mahi mahi.
Justin N.,"Oswego, IL",1,13,6,4.0,3/5/2016,Good food but slow service once seated.  Staff was friendly but again slow and at times felt deserted
Pamela W.,"Broadview, IL",4,66,292,2.0,12/13/2015,"I'm not a fan. I went there twice & neither time did I enjoy it. The first time I had chicken enchilada & 2nd time I ordered the chicken marsala. I had to sent it back because it didn't taste like chicken. I ordered the southwest salad & it was good if you don't put the ranch dressing on it. The cheesecake was great! I had a red velvet, white chocolate, & apple strudel."
Rebecca C.,"Naperville, IL",1441,180,1105,3.0,10/7/2013,"Okay.....honestly I only come here for the Peach Bellini. I am not a fan of the food. They have tooooooo many options, which to me means that they not good at cooking any one cuisine well. However... Their wings and fries are great!!!! I think it's the awesome ranch dressing. I'm craving some of that ranch right now!!! :) Also.... Surprise surprise ... This was the first time I've ever tried the cheesecake from my over a dozen times of being here. I had the Godiva (heart attack) cheesecake. Wow... Amazing!!! It's very rich in flavor and if your a chocolate lover, it's for you! Seriously... rich.... I brought it home and it took 3 days to eat it! Ha! :)"
Christopher G.,"Chicago, IL",32,26,53,4.0,9/10/2015,"I decided to have lunch at the Cheesecake Factory (Oak Brook) on Labor Day. It had probably been 10+ years since I'd dined there so it was time for a visit. For an appetizer I ordered the Fried Won Tons which were plentiful and tasty (though not true Chinese Won Tons). For my entree I had the Lemon-Herb Roasted Chicken which included an all natural half chicken, mashed potatoes, carrots and watercress and was topped with a light lemon garlic-herb sauce. The meal was hearty and taste good overall. By the time I'd finished my entree I was full and could only order a slice of strawberry cheesecake to go. As always, the dessert was exceptional, light, fresh and satisfying. My visit back to TCF was well worth the trip and re-ignited my interest in their offerings. Next time it'll be the Red Velvet Cheesecake for sure!"
Ann P.,"Chicago, IL",0,83,4,2.0,11/13/2015,"The food is great but this place has serious downsides.  It's always overcrowded, the wait is always an hour or more, and then when you do get your food they seem to rush you out the door.  My husband and I have stopped coming here due to the crazy wait times and the extreme overcrowding.  To summarize: - Always overcrowded with a wait of about 1-3 hours.  If you come on a Friday or Saturday evening after 4:00 pm, expect to wait at least 1.5 hours (it will probably be closer to 2+ hours). - If you come on a weekend after 4:00 pm, you will barely be able to walk in the front door because the reception area is small and there's usually about 100 people waiting for a table. - Once you get your food, it seems like the servers want to rush you out the door - They need to get on Open Table and offer reservations to cut down on the ridiculous wait times.   - They should build a 2nd level with about 100 more tables and hire about 50 more servers to deal with the crowds."
Christopher S.,"Chattanooga, TN",34,53,2,5.0,8/18/2015,"Me and my wife love the Cheesecake Factory. From the bread with butter, to your meal that you ordered, and of course they have amazing cheesecake. My favorite thing to eat here is the 4 cheese pasta and my favorite cheesecake is definitely the white chocolate raspberry cheesecake. The service is also really great, everything we come here. I would recommend this location to all my friends and family."
dottie r.,"Geneva, IL",1,35,,2.0,7/5/2015,"Normally we like this place but not as much today. The wait staff was attentive but... Outside patio filthy with trash on the ground and dirty tables already set for the next guests (I used my napkin to clean my area, including my seat, before sitting down), Salmon - out of it, Tuscan chicken -- overcooked, Ladies bathroom - no soap in one of 2 dispensers, Ladies bathroom - stall door lock broken, Ladies bathroom - trash overflowing. Normally I might think they had been busy and maybe this explained the messiness (not that this would even be a good excuse), but the place had plenty of open seating both in and out. Apparently the staff on the clock - managers, hostessesss, hosts, etc. were still enjoying their holiday as they certainly weren't keeping the place up to its normal standards."
Anjlee R.,"Chicago, IL",0,4,1,1.0,10/9/2015,"This review is based solely on customer service. My family loves cheesecake factory and we go to or pick up from this location atleast once a month. Last few times, I've called for pick up, I could tell they were busy and I was on hold for around 10-15mins. No biggie, it was the weekend.....  But today was just ridiculous, I called around 8:15pm and was on hold for abt 15mins and the line got disconnected. So I called back and the hostess? answered and I explained to her that I was hold and got disconnected. I also asked if I was gonna have to wait another 15mins since they seem extremely busy - to which she apologized and explained that they were shortstaffed and the person behind the bakery (who also takes care of Togo orders) is by herself tonight. The hostess then transferred me over to the bakery, after letting me know that she will make sure my call is answered soon.  Well, my call was NEVER picked up and after waiting on hold for 27+ minutes, I hung up and called another restaurant. Maybe it's time we find a different location for our cheesecake fix!"
Baan H.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,1,,1.0,3/4/2017,"Terrible customer service and staff as usual. No matter how many times it's brought to the attention of management and EVEN corporate, they never seem to fix things. Every single time me or my family has ordered take out here, their seems to be something wrong with our order by the time we're home. As any customer would do, we call back to let the manager know. And instead of doing anything to fix the problem, like offering a replacement, the management claims that there's nothing wrong with the order AND that we only call  to receive free food or gift cards....lol, seriously? Is it really our fault that every time we order something they mess it up? My family and I have been coming here for years, but the only time there's anything wrong with the order is when we get take out. The fact that this location can treat a regular customer so badly is just sad. They always seem to mess something up, but instead of taking any accountability, they like to blame the customer for it.   Unfortunately, I had no choice but to go here tonight JUST to get cheesecake. I wouldn't be able to drive a half hour away at 11 pm to another location--since this is the closest to me. But yet again, they managed to screw this order up too. It's pretty obvious it was deliberately done due to their immature and prejudice staff. In particular, the girl at the bakery that takes the orders--Kristina.  Sadly, management or corporate doesn't do anything about this reoccurring issue--it's just sad that this problem never gets resolved."
Alexa Q.,"Saugatuck, MI",13,8,3,3.0,9/12/2015,"I had the BBQ ranch chicken salad and it had great textures but was a bit bland for having the name ""BBQ"".  We had the coffee cheesecake which was good but not like NYC!"
Gwenevere B.,"Chicago, IL",0,2,,5.0,3/2/2017,"Last night my mother and I visited The Cheesecake Factory - Oakbrook for dinner and really had an enjoyable experience.  I have visited two other locations - downtown Chicago and Orland Park but this was my favorite by far. The decor was so beautiful and the dim lights - relaxing, great service, but most importantly the phenomenal food and scrumptious cheesecake!"
lefvia m.,"Chicago, IL",2,122,642,4.0,12/15/2015,Always enjoy this place... Service is kinda of slow but I guess it's expected ... I enjoy the happy hour aptzr though drinks seem smaller and at times watered down ... Food is consistent ... My favorite is the hot sour dough bread... Oh it's Yumi
Annie H.,"Oak Lawn, IL",211,3,,3.0,8/6/2016,"Honestly, this is the only cheesecake factory that I've been to that I've completely enjoyed the food and thought it was great. However, the service I had my most recent time was terrible. There was probably 10+ servers walking around, and it was not crowded at all on a Friday afternoon around 2:30pm. Regardless of the light business at the time and the incredible amount of servers that seemed to be walking around we waited a very long time for a server, our food, drinks, and rarely saw our waitress. It also seemed as if all the servers were scattered about and did not have specific sections and were running around all over the place. Basically, it seemed very unorganized and the service was not good and unfortunately that made the time less than exceptional."
