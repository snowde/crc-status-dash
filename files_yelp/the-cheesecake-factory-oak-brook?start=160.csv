Toni R.,"Long Beach, CA",15,69,223,3.0,6/28/2015,Cajun jambalaya pasta is off the charts here. But the wait is horrible and they should work on their customer service.
R.J. V.,"Downers Grove, IL",36,106,194,3.0,9/29/2015,"Food was good but not great. Service was really good tonight though. The cheesecake tasted great but was maybe a bit too sweet for me. But that's my opinion. The food was yummy but for the cost I would've liked more. The calamari was such a small portion but it was tasty. If the main course was a bit better I could have given this place a 4 star, and maybe one day I will. But for now I give it just a 3 star."
Britta M.,"Grand Rapids, MI",18,62,43,4.0,9/28/2014,"It will take you forever waiting to get seated here, and they don't take reservations. Once you are seated though...We get excellent service every time we come here, and their food is really not expensive for the generous portions and quality. Their menu is enormous. It will take you a while to land on a decision, which is actually a bonus since their sourdough and brown wheat breads are divine for snacking on while narrowing your options. Small plates. Order them. The chicken Samoas & dynamite shrimp are fantastic. Appetizer. The buffalo blasts with their homemade bleu cheese are to die for!! My favorite item on the menu. Dinner options are all good with large portions and lots of calories! They recently added lighter calorie menu options as well though. Dessert. Cheesecakes. So good. White Chocolate Raspberry, Adams Peanut Butter Cup, Red Velvet. The only poor decision you can make here is to not order dessert because you're full. Take a slice home!"
Ramsey B.,"Palos Hills, IL",399,538,21,5.0,8/22/2015,This place has excellent service and great parking.  The food is always perfectly prepared.  The service is top notch.  The brunch items on Sundays provide an amazing breakfast experience.  The Bruleed French Toast is a favorite.  I usually order this item for my dessert.  The Cheesecakes are the BEST in the business.  The Dulce de leche cheesecake is a must have if you have yet to taste this delicious dessert item.  The sweet corn tamale cakes and avacado egg rolls are our favorite appetizers.  The burgers and sandwiches are excellent.  ALL their entrees are delicious.  The quantity of every item is is usually plenty and enough for the next day.   The new items such as the steak tacos are good.  They were plentiful (4 per order) although I prefer the traditional steak taco.
Susan H.,"Chicago, IL",206,168,3192,3.0,4/15/2014,"""I'm gonna go down to The Cheesecake Factory... have a drink."" I've been to this location several times when in the area shopping and I must say, I enjoy it very much.  I never stray from the Skinnylicious menu as it provides a refreshing variety of lean options (including cocktails...mmmkay) with caloric intake posted above the items.  They also have Coke Zero which I cannot seem to find at any other restaurant to date.  That winning combo is the draw for me.  Don't get me wrong; I indulge in fatty-fat-fattening goodies elsewhere; Lawdy, do I ever, but I like to balance out my bulge with a bit of beets. I know for certain I can come here and find something healthy that's generous in portion and will always be fresh and flavorful.  A waist is a terrible thing to mind. Their cozy ambience,  attentive staff, freshly ground pepper, and delicious decor make this a casual yet snazzy place to plop inside a booth and sit a spell. I've always felt they were overpriced with their dinner items and yesterday there was but one soup option available;  It was butterbean-bacon and although it sounded delicious, it wasn't in the stars for me.  How I suffah.   Although their cheesecake is insanely popular, I haven't had it in ages; Being of Baltic blood, I tend to favor my cheesecake much less sweet. and sans whipped cream.  Lithuanians...Germans...we're pretty fantastic with our cheesecakes (and all things potato and bacon)."
David S.,"Downers Grove, IL",6,98,,4.0,4/22/2016,"More flavors of cheesecakes than one can imagine and each one more delicious than the last. Also, their whipped cream is a marvelous accoutrement to the edible euphoria that is a cheesecake from the Cheesecake factory. The sandwiches and burgers are also delicious. The only quibble is that there should be a greater selection of sugar free dessert offerings."
Shane F.,"Schneider, IN",38,20,,3.0,8/6/2016,"Stick with dessert! Hence the name, the cheesecake and coffee make for a great after dinner stop.  Don't get the mushroom soup. The avacado eggrolls used to be good.  Lately they're too greasy and had a couple times where the avacado was past."
Zoey K.,"Huntington Beach, CA",260,71,135,5.0,10/27/2014,"They have EXCELLENT food mA!!! It is delicious I tell u delicious. The cheesecake was so heavenly, u need to try the white chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake.  Also check out there avocado rolls n fried mac n cheese.  The only thing I wish they had was halal meat"
Elle R.,"Oakbrook Terrace, IL",3,28,4,1.0,7/21/2015,"This is the third time I have been to the oak brook Cheesecake Factory. All 3 times I have ordered one meal, they bring out the wrong order and try to convince me it is my fault/ what I ordered. They offer no apologies and are irritated that you mention the order is wrong. For having so much staff,  can't seem to get it right. Long wait times. Too busy to focus on the customers. Not dependable. Disappointed."
Monet E.,"Lansing, MI",43,30,9,4.0,7/7/2016,Food was very good! We came in and had no wait (after 9pm) the waiter was kind of slow but it did not effect the quality of the food! And the cheesecake...delicious!!
Leah H.,"Chatham, IL",6,46,7,5.0,5/20/2015,"Best one I've eaten at.  We actually are here twice while visiting for a three day trip.  Love the extensive menu.  Yes it's a lot to choose from, but ask yourself: ""am I in the mood for sandwiches, pasta, burger, chicken, steak, seafood?""  They have it! Good kids menu too.   ***their sweet potato fries are my favorite anywhere!!! Everything we had was exceptional.  Service, food, everything!"
Kelli D.,"Willowbrook, IL",9,160,262,5.0,5/28/2014,"I am absolutely obsessed with Cheesecake Factory. I've gone to a bunch of them and they are all great. This one is located in the oakbrook mall. It has parking on both sides, valet, and outside sitting.  There menu is sensory overload. Anything that you could possibly be craving- they have. They have a lite menu for our calorie counters. But remember all their portion sizes are huge- for two people. So no matter how hungry you are, just split. They have happy hour and small plate deals in the bar on weekdays.  They obviously have a million cheesecakes. My goal is to try them all. I've had the caramel, raspberry, and regular- all delicious. Regular tiramisu is better than the cheesecake version. My favorite dishes are Thai lettuce wraps, baked artichokes, and BBQ ranch salad. And remember, they're drinks are strong...especially the LIT which I just had and have to say, I'm feeling good :)"
Danielle Y.,"Bolingbrook, IL",0,6,13,4.0,4/9/2016,"There are probably tons of reviews for Cheesecake Factory, but if you don't mind I'll add one more lol. First, I cannot give this place 5 stars because it seems like every time I go the wait can be really long. Also, the service amongst wait staff is not consistent. The reason I gave it 4 stars is because of the food. Some of my favorite dishes are the Crispy Chicken Costoletta, Tex Mex Egg Rolls, Louisiana Chicken Pasta, Lemon Herb Roasted Chicken, Shrimp Scampi, and surprisingly the Steak."
D F.,"Chicago, IL",0,7,78,4.0,12/12/2015,This place is amazing. Everyone that I bring here falls in love with the food and cheesecake.  The only reason this place received 4 stars is because like every other place there's room for improvement  and by that I mean possibly adding on and making more seating. Awesome place!
Carol H.,"Naperville, IL",2,22,22,4.0,10/1/2015,"Can't miss by going to a Cheese Cake Factory. We had the best service, the bread was hot out of the oven, and free refills. Only disappointment was they didn't take the Chicago area ""Let Us Entertain You"" cards any longer. I was also disappointed they didn't have crayons, or something for the little guests. (So bring your own!) But our waitress was stellar, and even went out of her way to get me a whole plain cheese cake, WITHOUT the sour cream topping. Great place, great atmosphere, and great food & service."
Patricia P.,"Aurora, IL",39,8,,1.0,1/11/2017,"We drove quite a distance to visit here, our nearest Cheesecake Factory. Upon arrival, we were told our wait would be about ten to fifteen minutes. We understand things can take longer and had worked in restaurants/bars in years before. After 20 minutes, we decide to use the restroom and get a cocktail at the bar. Restroom was utterly disgusting. Tissue and paper towels were everywhere. The floors were filthy wet with dirty tissue and paper towels sticking all over and trailing out the door. It was obvious it had not been cleaned or even checked in a long time unless the mess went ignored by staff. Attempted to order a drink at the bar and even with two bartenders on a steady (but not overly busy) evening, they couldn't be bothered to ask what we'd like to drink after standing at the bar for ten minutes. It is a very small bar. Completely inept, too busy socializing with other staff, and couldn't keep up at all. We had checked with the hostess about our table and she never told us what was going on with our wait. We handed over our pager and walked out.  Horrible service across the board there."
Dr John S.,"Bolingbrook, IL",3,45,25,5.0,8/28/2015,Cheesecake Factory never disappoints! Had most of the family there including our littlest food critic Elwood! He loved the bread and flirted with everybody there! We will definitely be back! The entire staff is first rate!
Alina B.,"Newton, MA",16,28,22,4.0,7/23/2015,"Cheesecake Factory is amazing for everyone who wants to taste incredible cheesecake. Really, I didn't expect my White Chocolate Caramel Macadamia Nut Cheesecake to be so delicious. Crusty and salty nuts, sweet caramel were combined with smooth and tender taste of cream, blended with white chocolate... Perfect! Also, I tried Steak Diane and I was surprised that this restaurant can be proud not only of their cakes but of their meals too. Very good medium grilled steak with mushroom sauce and mashed potatoes was wonderful.  The stuff was very nice there. Although, there were many people we didn't have to wait for a long time to get table and our meals. I didn't give them 5 stars because my friend found some hair in her meal. Well, it happens. Who knows? We were outside and it was windy, so that hair might get into her plate eventually. I still believe The Cheesecake Factory is a great place to have dinner ;)"
Kavita B.,"Reynoldsburg, OH",17,88,816,4.0,7/10/2015,"Cheesecake factory in Oakbrook Terrace is one of the best place for dining with waiting hours. This place is always crowded whether its weeknd or weekdays. Finally after waiting for 20-25 min,we got settled and ordered mocktails Typhoon Punch and Red Sangria. I liked Typhoon punch,very refreshing.. The menu was big with many options. We ordered Pasta Da vinci and Four Cheese pasta. Both were delicious,with large portions. This place is very big with beautiful interior,staff was very helpful."
Martin P.,"Forest Park, IL",6,239,264,1.0,2/2/2015,"The ONLY reason I went was because I received a gift card and now I remember why I do not go to this chain. I always hated waiting for like 30 to 45 minutes for a seat, it seems with the decor as ugly as it is, the chain could do more. Maybe a second level instead of high freaking ceilings with ugly decorations??? I had the BBQ chicken pizza because the menu does not tell you everything that comes with the item! So I went with the safest thing on the menu! For example the shrimp appetizer came with a weird thousand island sauce covering the entire plate on the bottom of all the shrimp! If you do not like the sauce nor see it listed in the menu or are allergic (like myself) you will be surprised! Overall, i will not go here again gift card be damned"
