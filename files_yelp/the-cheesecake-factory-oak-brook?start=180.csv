Colleen B.,"Colorado Springs, CO",129,252,31,4.0,1/19/2015,"My fiance and I came here for lunch one Saturday afternoon after my class ended at College of DuPage. When we got here, we had to wait a fair amount of time but nothing terribly long. I had been to another location before, but this was Dan's first time. Now we both ordered lunch and got a decent sized meal. I had the mac-n-cheese burger (again) and the fries. I gobbled it down no problem and you'd have a hard time getting me to order something else. I mean, I know it's good. I know I like it. Why change? Dan really liked his food too and I believe he ordered a sandwich with fries. Then comes the cheesecake. After convincing Dan it was a must, we ordered a slice of the white chocolate cheesecake. Normally, I want like 18 flavors that include chocolate and peanut butter. But Dan wants something simple, so I met him halfway. The cheesecake was awesome. Even though Dan was full, we still fought over every bit to see who can get more! I would definitely return here. The service was what I expected, but I would avoid their busy times as the wait can be long."
Kaylee J.,"Chicago, IL",1,15,2,2.0,2/15/2015,Service was great. Food was overseasoned and very mediocre. I may go back again and try something new since the menu is huge.
John J.,"Bellwood, IL",0,2,1,4.0,11/6/2015,"The food and service at this location is wonderful...that is, if you even get a chance to experience it. The wait times are terrrrrrible on the weekends! It wouldn't be as bad if they had more seats on the inside for the people waiting. Instead, you walk in to a sea of people waiting to be seated and a lot of times they're blocking the check in desk.  All that aside, they have a pretty vast menu that caters to whatever you're in the mood for. I'd definitely go back, but not during peak hours."
Sean P.,"Oswego, IL",0,10,,5.0,12/2/2016,Amazing food! Service was great! The only downfall is the wait times for tables. I can deal with that knowing how delicious the food is!
Suzanne B.,"Brookfield, IL",387,883,326,3.0,1/13/2014,"This place loses points for service. I was there on a date recently and we ordered an appetizer. They brought it out and didn't get us any plates to eat it on. It was a dip so it definitely needed a plate to rest on, but our waitress was running around everywhere but our table. Ordering drinks took a long time as well. As far as food goes, I had a chicken tostada salad that was amazing. Not low fat by any means but I didn't care. Portions were so big that I had half to take home, and it still filled up the whole container.  We split a piece of cheesecake. So rich you only need one for two people! It was white chocolate raspberry and was very good. I will go back, I'm just hoping for a different waitress next time!"
D A.,"Black River Falls, WI",0,4,1,5.0,11/7/2016,"This place was hopping and fabulous late at night, the Steak Diane was unbelievable, served the kids, they loved their food, had a great time; wasn't sure, but now hooked; gotto go again, soon."
Marilyn H.,"Arlington Heights, IL",6,15,,3.0,5/30/2016,The food is usually good at Cheesecake Factories but one thing that seems to occur at any location we have been to is poor service.  We experienced it here and in Schaumburg and Lincolnshire.  I had an omelette which was excellent.  My husband had spaghetti and it took a long time to get extra sauce.  The hot fudge sundae was very good. There was no near-beer.
Kelly H.,"Brookfield, IL",15,12,,4.0,6/12/2016,"HUGE menu - the the point where it's difficult to choose something. Everything's good.  They have an entire ""Light Side"" menu.  Of course they have an immense amount of cheesecake flavors.  The classic is still a classic for a reason, though.  Top with cherries or strawberries for a traditional punch.  Decor is gorgeous and dramatic, although the tables are too close together, in my opinion. And the wait can be too long if your group is larger than a party of two.  Parking is often difficult, too."
Renita M.,"Lombard, IL",437,804,41,4.0,11/13/2013,"Yeah, I know, it's a big chain with a big menu, blah blah blah. But I will give them some credit: they actually do make everything fresh, and regularly change up their large menu with seasonal items. Here's what I liked: No wait around 5:30 on a Friday (though there certainly was one when we left) Service was solid Food was really good, actually We got nachos as an appetizer; they had tasty pulled chicken, good amounts of cheese, fresh guacamole and pico de gallo, and were nice and hot. For my dinner I got two items from the small plates -- a sausage and ricotta flatbread and an arugula salad, lightly dressed with lemon, olive oil, parmesan, marcona almonds and golden raisins. The flatbread was deliciously garlicky (a little skimpy on the sausage but oh well) and the crust was airy and chewy-crisp. The salad was well-dressed and just the right size. My husband got a chipotle chicken sandwich and seemed to enjoy it.  Not all of the portions are huge, I'd like to add -- they do have a nice variety of more reasonable sized plates. That said I did see one of the biggest burritos in existence, about a foot long and at least four inches wide.  What's not to like? Well, the building has huge ceilings and the tables are close together so it's very echoey and kind of loud.  And there is the argument that if you have a menu spanning sushi rolls to pasta dishes to Tex-Mex you may not be doing any of it well -- I can't speak for the entire menu, but I can say that what we ate was good. That said the prices are a couple bucks higher than I'd like for the quality and atmosphere. We probably won't be regulars here, because it does seem to cater primarily to tourists, business travelers and mall-goers, but I would come back."
Govi S.,"Wheaton, IL",120,73,129,3.0,4/19/2015,"I was here with my mom and wife to celebrate our civil wedding anniversary and it was my moms first at Cheese cake. Was a Saturday night and we just had a 15 min wait. We ordered the fried Mac and cheese balls on red sauce which was awesome. My mom just loved it. My mom is a total vegetarian so she got the egg plant Parmesan with pesto pasta, my wife ordered the veggie burger with sweet potato fries and I got the chicken salad sandwich. Off these 3 only the veggie burger was good. The pesto pasta was too oily and the eggplant was kinda soggy. The chicken sandwich was soo salty and greasy. I wanted to finish the night with a low calorie cheese cake which was soft and was upto standard. On the whole not a great first experience for my mom and I wasn't impressed either."
Laura B.,"Bellwood, IL",134,10,2,1.0,7/15/2016,"I have spent thousands of dollars at this location. I have never been so upset. I made a purchase to go of a salad that was not made correctly and the manager Chris only wanted to comp me a cheesecake. I had a friend pick the salad up for me cause I was on my work lunch break, meanwhile, I hadn't eaten all day so I was starving. I contacted Chris and told him I was at work and I couldn't leave. He said that he would give me the apples they forgot to put on my salad and a cheesecake. Not a new salad with apples. He expected me to not eat on my lunch break and wait 4.5 hours and drive back to the restaurant for apples. I  tried to be very nice about the issue but he kept insisting that I was only getting a cheesecake. Eventually he opted out of cheesecake and said he would give me the salad, but not willingly. Therefore,  I stood there and cried cause I couldn't believe I had to go thru all this for lettuce. I left without anything cause I was so frustrated that I had to be treated like this and all I wanted was my salad made correctly the way I paid for it."
Jessie W.,"Lombard, IL",4,60,6,1.0,11/7/2015,I went here with 3 friends for my 60th birthday lunch and I was so disappointed in the meal that I really never got to eat. We went in and waited about 30 minutes not big deal it was Saturday afternoon and the wait was not bad. We were given a nice table and waited quite awhile for our server but they were busy so that part was okay and she was really nice. Now for the food. It just was awful. I was so looking forward to trying the mac/burger since it was my first time at this place. I ordered it medium with no salt on the fries. It came out like a brick and the fries had so much salt I sent it back. Than when it came out again it was RAW I mean not even medium rare but raw so I couldn't eat is and by that time I was done. My friend had a veggie burger and she hated it very mushy but she didn't say anything. My other friend had a chicken buffalo sandwich they brought the wrong sauce (blue cheese) and when she said something they just brought out new sauce but by then the sandwich was ruined and she didn't eat her either. My other friend got a salad and sweet potato fries and said the salad was just okay but the fries were full of grease. The manager did come over and take 2 items off the check but it wasn't enough we should not have been charged for anything other than the drinks. Just bad customer service as far as I am concerned. Even with 2 meals taken off it was still almost 75.00 without the tip. This was suppose to be an amazing afternoon with great friends and turned into a rotten day with really nobody having anything much to eat. It really just sucked to have my birthday lunch just ruined and to top it off it was my idea to go there. UGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Joe K.,"Des Plaines, IL",0,7,,1.0,1/21/2016,"This Cheesecake Factory is going downhill. Brought the family to celebrate my wife's birthday. Waited 15 mins and we along with 3 other parties were pages at once. They we all waited an additional 15 mins. The hostess didn't even remember we turned in a pager. Finally sat down, looked at the menu to find no fettuccini with chicken and sun dried tomatoes. They took it off the menu. They they got our appetizers wrong. Bad experience. Must be under new management."
Christopher L.,"Plainfield, IL",1,8,,5.0,5/8/2016,"I cannot complain about one single thing during my visit. In fact, it was amazing even down to the wait times on Mother's Day. We only had to wait for 40 minutes which is certainly acceptable. The food was amazing, you must order the Imperial Chicken (not currently on the menu). And the new Lemon Meringue Cheesecake is delicious! I wanted to buy an entire pie. The service was amazing. Our server was very attentive and took her time to make suggestions and knew the food very well. I will definitely be returning to this location."
Steve C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,32,10,5.0,1/20/2015,"Chicken Marsala, Cajun Pasta Jambalaya, Thai lettuce wraps, cheesecakes, Sunday brunch - all awesome. If you can't find something you like here, you're just too picky.  Everything is pretty good, portions are large, and the delicious bread basket is terrible for those on a lo-carb program."
Livvy O.,"Chicago, IL",78,225,224,5.0,2/15/2015,"I've been going here for years. I've never been disappointed. Of course the waits are always long on weekend nights and parking is always difficult, but it's worth it. I'm always excited for the bread especially the sweet brown one.  I normally get the salmon with mashed potatoes which is always good. The chicken and biscuits are yummy too, huge portions. Recently I tried the the fish tacos. I remember the first time I tried them I wasn't that impressed, but I wanted something light so I decided to try it again. I liked the fish tacos, not so much the salsa though. The fish was very light and no fishy taste at all. The black beans and rice had a weird flavor. I would have rather had it plain white rice and beans.  The dessert is what's it's all about. Can't go wrong with any of the choices. I personally like the chocolate mouse because it's a lighter cheesecake for after dinner.  The one thing I like best is that they give you large portions. I almost always have leftovers to take home. You definitely get you money's worth."
J M.,"Hinsdale, IL",1,29,,1.0,11/6/2015,No WiFi!   What modern restaurant doesn't have WiFi?  How can you have a business lunch without WiFi?  Unbelievable!  We walked out and across the parking lot to Wildfire.  We could have gone to any other restaurant in the mall.   They ALL have WiFi!
Evie S.,"The Loop, Chicago, IL",4,148,52,1.0,11/28/2015,"I WILL NEVER SET FOOT INTHIS ESTABLISHMENT! I was in the mood for cheesecake factory usually going to the one downtown we decided to try the one in oak brook. First of all  the waitress which i did not catch her name was rude and unattentive! She served us water and did not return after that not even brought us bread. There was another couple sotted next to us  who was seated 15 mins after us. She right away brought their water, bread and took their order. And where just waiting to get bread. Upon asking her is we may have some bread, she gave us an attitude and said ""oh sure"". We decided to leave and talk to the manager. Spoke to the manager and he could care less. You could tell they did not want to be there. This happened around 3pm on a Saturday. I hate to pull the race card but this is what I truly believe the reason for the horrendous service was! Im furious with anger as I type and I will be contacting corporate!"
Angela P.,"Aurora, IL",440,1743,13,2.0,2/13/2013,"My last review stated that the golden rule of Cheesecake Factory was to avoid, avoid, AVOID on Fridays and Saturdays. My rule has changed:  Avoid Cheesecake Factory (Oak Brook) altogether. My friend and I met here for a gluttonous Fat Tuesday meal.  I had the macaroni and cheese burger, followed by a slice of raspberry lemon cheesecake.  I felt like I had a brick in my stomach all the way through to the next morning!  I'm not complaining, though, Cheesecake Factory really is one of America's best and holds up the stereotype that we eat way too much.  But the food is good.   The menu is all over the place, so they don't really have a speciality.  Order what intrigues you or your guilty pleasure - you'll like it. So why the 2 stars?  The service here is HORRIBLE!  Our waitress, Tasha, seemed normal at first.  She told us about the specials, and her favorite cheesecakes, and our drinks and food arrived without a problem.  The end of the meal is when it got strange.  She delivered our checks with 2 pens.  2 pens with Cooper's Hawk printed on them.  Huh? When she came back for our checks, she demanded to know where the second pen was.  I ignored her at first, since any sane person would glance around quickly and then walk away.  It is, after all, a pen.  A pen that belongs to another restaurant!  Instead, she stood there while I stared right back at her and said, ""I don't know.  I don't know where it is.""  She stood there while I looked under the table and my friend shuffled plates and napkins around.  No pen.  She continued to stand there.  Awkward. When she finally walked away, I overheard her sarcastically say to another waitress, ""do you have a pen I can borrow?"" CF needs to stop hiring waitresses with high school attitudes.  I probably won't be back."
Jennifer N.,"Seattle, WA",480,700,37,5.0,2/27/2013,"Yummy yummy!  We went here for dinner last night and it was delicious!  I ate off of the skinnylicious menu and had the shrimp tacos.  They were really really good - I really enjoyed them.  I also had a couple bites of the dolce de leche cheesecake.  It was OMG good.  Seriously omg good.  I loved it. No complaints about the location - service was great, parking was easy, etc etc.  Overall - loved it."
