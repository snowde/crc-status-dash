Joshua E.,"Charlotte, NC",97,171,441,4.0,7/24/2014,"I went there in the afternoon on a weekday, and there was a small wait. The ambiance is great, the walls and tables are very pretty.service was okay. The server brought us the wrong food but recovered fast and got is the right order.I had the soup and salad and it was pretty good. my only thing was the wait. Parking lot was very full tough to get parking."
Nisreen A.,"Burbank, IL",2,35,7,1.0,10/4/2014,"Terrible experience with management and we hadn't even walked in. Extremely rude.  Update: came back. Made reservations for specific tables, the Table was given to another family and our group was forced to split. Have never had a good experience at this location. Management and customer service skills are subpar."
Jaci Y.,"Chicago, IL",514,745,120,4.0,1/2/2013,"I really enjoy dining at this location. The Cheesecake Factory has good food and excellent service. Last night we tried their fish and chips, steak Diane, and garlic spaghetti which were all very tasty and full of flavorful. I didn't try the fish and chips but my husband said the fish was nice and flaky . I had one of their combination platters half steak Diane and half herb salmon with smash potatoes.  I liked the steak more than I liked the salmon the mash potatoes were yummy. My friend had the garlic spaghetti which was full of good garlic flavor and I really liked how you got to have a choice of shrimp or chicken to go along with the dish.  we had for dessert their famous Apple Caramel Cheesecake and their Lemoncello Torte which is amazing."
Candice G.,"Silicon Valley, CA",4882,2676,18600,3.0,2/23/2010,"I don't know, Man. The food just seems pretty run of the mill to me.  Like, borderline microwave made or reheated. And I get that huge portions are their schtick, but it just makes me feel like an American pig.  I got the fish tacos on my last visit and they weren't good. The fish had a questionable taste and the taco filling ingredients just didn't go together... or maybe it was still the sour taste of the fish *cringe*... thus, I'm not eating fish anymore. Hello, aversion.  In the Summer they do have a nice little outdoor patio but it really just overlooks the mall parking lot. Oh, and the parking lot is a TOTAL mess. There's just not enough parking and what little is available is reserved for valet parking... and I'm just not about to pay to valet my car at Oakbrook Mall for the Cheesecake factory.

Lucy C.,"Chicago, IL",221,231,31,4.0,2/25/2014,"Ahh, 'murrica. Home of massive portions of mediocre food. And then dessert. The best thing about The Cheesecake Factory is their ability to accommodate large groups. I dined with a party of 20 and they were great about sectioning off an area for us, even though a party of that size requires two tables, two servers, and (at least) two checks.  My friends tried to bully me into getting a different cheesecake for each course of my meal. Had I not eaten ice cream for lunch that day, I may have done just that. Each slice is like a generous slice of heaven. Depending on your mood, you can get something light and palette cleansing, like the mango key lime, or something rich and decadent, like the Godiva chocolate on chocolate on chocolate. But in all honesty, I would definitely be a happy camper just making a meal of their brown oat bread and a slice or two of cheesecake."
Courtney H.,"Shorewood, IL",89,316,178,1.0,4/9/2015,"A manager called me (presumably to apologize) last week and she left me a message. I forgot to call her back until this week. She was out of the restaurant when I called the first time but no one offered to take a message. I called again yesterday, was told she was there, and then waited on hold almost 10 minutes before I hung up. This customer service reflects exactly why I wrote a review in the first place."
Chris D.,"Elmhurst, IL",0,13,,2.0,5/29/2014,"This place looks great and has a monster menu.   That being said the food is average at best, yet the price is much higher than average. During the last visit, we went for brunch.  My kids got pancakes and didn't finish them.  That should tell you all you need to know, but it's pretty hard to mess up pancakes for a kid.  They just didn't like them.  I tried something different, some kind of eggs benedict variation.  It looked spectacular, but once again it was just OK.....and $15 for a breakfast entre with no meat. About once a year we decide to give it another try, but we are always underwhelmed."
LOIS B.,"Downers Grove, IL",333,874,92,1.0,12/28/2011,"So, does this place really need another review?  Yes, because I had to walk out to compose myself and then return to finally get seated ~ just as they opened. Given the occasion for my being there in the first place, the first booth they tried to seat me at would not work.  I asked for a table.  It doesn't exist in this restaurant.  EVERY TABLE has at least one bench for seating ~ no 4 chairs.  So while I'm waiting for the person to check on a switch, another guy comes and tries to seat another party, RIGHT WHERE I ALREADY AM.  He gives me the, ""excuse me"" I want to seat someone else where you are sitting.  Then the first guy comes back and arranges 2 tables in the most crazy way ~ put them together between other tables instead of just putting us at the end of the row.  Before I can gather all my belongings from the original booth, the second guy is back with the same party he tried to seat while I was still there.  When I asked about the end, the original guy became very frustrated with me and said I needed to speak with a manager. Why is this SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO friggin' hard? So, I come back in and am seated in exactly the SAME location only on the other side of the wall.  Okay, the rest of the party begins to arrive. Then, when we are comfortable and chatting, another guy comes over to inform us that they are going to have to move us so they can seat other patrons where we are.  Being the bold Yelper that I am, I refused to move, one more time. He tried to convince me that we WERE going to move and when another person in the party spoke up, he very sarcastically said, ""Enjoy your meal."" Each meal came out individually, one at a time.  Again, something I have never experienced before.  Not hot by the time mine finally came out.  NO BIG SURPRISE THERE. Large selection so, to me, that says they really have no special dish they are famous for.  Our server was very pleasant. Way too many other restaurants to choose from to treat patrons in this manner."
Trina K.,"Chicagoland, IL",99,920,2433,3.0,11/11/2012,"Stopped in after a day of shopping. Attempted to place a order to go by phone for my favorite cheesecake. After holding several minutes, I decided to walk over. I stood in line and placed my order and held on the phone just to see how long it would take.  After I ordered face to face, one person answered. I told him I was holding and decided to come in. I was told it is quicker to come in.  So, I would recommend against a take out order if you are nearby."
Laura A.,"Willowbrook, IL",2,42,,4.0,4/26/2014,A great place for large groups because of the large variety of food.  I love their avocado egg rolls. Seriously delicious. They have a cilantro sauce that really puts them over the top.  Obviously their cheesecake is fabulous. I live the mango key lime coconut one.
Lupe D.,"Chicago, IL",158,431,427,4.0,12/27/2013,"We has a taste for some cheesecake for dessert. Saturday before Christmas, we thought for sure we would never get a table - but there we went anyway.  I said, before we got out of the car, if the wait is too long, we are leaving.... We walk in, see people waiting - ask for an estimated time to wait - 15 minutes - WOW, that's nothing.  Then we were told that if we wanted to sit at one of the high tables in the bar area, there was no wait - SOLD! Our waiter, Michael was a gem! He was so attentive and friendly and was quick to describe all of the cheesecakes we asked him about.  Loved him!  He helped make this a wonderful experience - even if it was ""just dessert"" it was a welcome break after a crazy day of shopping madness!!   As far as the food, we had several types of cheesecakes - all of which were really good.   Will definitely be back if we are in the area!"
Nancy E.,"River Grove, IL",0,43,8,4.0,8/12/2015,"I had never bin here ,but my date night here was awesome right from the appetizer to dinner: the combo steak Diane and Romano chicken wow right to the awesome vanilla bean cheese cake, it was so creamy and cloudy ,now that I got your attention it awesome food but you better be ready for the bill and don't  get seated toward the back corner near the kitchen they seem to drop a lot of dishes lol but other then the loud dish dropping and interesting Spanish banter between the bus boys the food was awesome ."
Rosie D.,"Forest Park, IL",162,136,45,4.0,3/14/2014,"I'm not a big cheesecake factory fan. The menu is to big, they restaurants tend to be to big. The drinks too expensive and I always inevitably get a sassy server. But this time I don't know if it was the occasion or the day or what but I actually had a great experience.  I've never been to this cheesecake factory before. It was sooooooo big. I thought it was nicer than the one in Caesar's palace in Vegas! (Don't ask me why I went to the cheesecake factory in Vegas. It's a long story). Any who, the hostess told me and my friends that it would be an hour and a half wait. We were a big group and it was Sunday afternoon so I get it. They're busy. So what did we do?  Hit the empty bar! Why wasn't everyone waiting at the bar I have no clue.  Our bartender was amazing!  Attentive, happy to be there,  funny,  everything you wait your booze slanger to be!  We all ordered fancy drinks that were delicious and apps that were also amazing! When they finally called our group we were all sufficiently liquored up and happy.  Our server was equally awesome!  She got all our orders right (there were 10 of us) and she offered to split our checks! We didn't have to ask!!  They have a really nice happy hour special. I never would have thought about going to the cheesecake factory for happy hour in the past but now l can't wait to go back!"
Becky J.,"Lisle, IL",40,5,,1.0,2/7/2015,I wouldn't even give this place a star if I didn't have to. Got there at 550pm on Saturday understand wait time do to a Saturday. After waiting hour and 10 like we were told (they stated we only been waiting 47 minutes) we were to another 30 minutes. Okay fine so wait another 20 asked again how long was told another 30 minutes!!! We ended up leaving I'd rather spend my money else where. We were not the only ones this was happening to at the time.
AnDrew B.,"Chicago, IL",24,14,3,4.0,1/22/2015,"Love the Cuban sandwich.  The buffalo blasts are to die for.  I am diabetic so I can't have sugar, tried the low carb cheesecake and it was amazing"
Shazia S.,"Naperville, IL",5,32,23,4.0,8/2/2015,Food is awesome as always !! Orderd shrimp jambalaya Fish tacos and Grilled salmon.. Afcourse my all time fav tiramisu cheese cake and godiva cheese cake too.. The only issue was our server.
Bobby O.,"Chicago, IL",312,257,187,5.0,12/3/2014,Very very very biased review. I am a total freak for cheesecake. I love it! They have a million types of cheesecake and a pretty good food selection in the restaurant. Tutrle Cheesecake hurt me baby...Blueberry cheesecake...euphoria...cherry cheesecake...Im a boy again!
Alexandra C.,"Wheaton, IL",66,22,17,3.0,6/14/2014,"The restaurant was crowded on a Sunday afternoon but there were only two of us so we were seated right away (lucky)!  We waited over 5 minutes to get greeted and I waited 10 minutes for my Bloody Mary. I suppose I'm spoiled because I work in an upscale restaurant that obtains 30 second greet times and 2 minute first round beverage time standards. It was a little bizarre.  The guacamole was fine. Again, took forever to get out. It's a huge restaurant so I understand if the kitchen gets a little backed up-but it was backed up on every aspect of our meal! No manager came around to apologize (something that is crucial in my place of employment when time standards are not met). I suppose it's just a different type of service! The food was ok. I got the beet salad which I thought would be bigger but I'm watching my weight anyway so I was ok with it. The only item that didn't take long was the swiping of our credit card! I guess they were eager to get us out!!  Tip for management-if time standards are not being met, a simple greet at the tables make a huge difference. It's your responsibility to look at ticket times in the window and ensure people aren't waiting over half hour for food."
Augustė Č.,"Lisle, IL",0,1,,3.0,10/11/2015,"Food was perfect as always. I had seared tuna salad and it was delicious! however baby changing station in the woman's restroom needs to be fixed. I was afraid for my two months old baby that she will fall down, because the station was broken :("
Bradley C.,"Woodstock, GA",14,384,2,2.0,6/23/2014,I try to like this place...but after 4 visits...I can't.  the food is average.  not good....not bad....just meh.....expensive meh.  the menus is like an 80's greatest hits list....and the servers try hard but don't seem to be very well trained. the cheesecake however is good.  I could see going for dessert and sit at the bar with a cocktail...but no more acid washed jeans and friendship bracelets for me.
