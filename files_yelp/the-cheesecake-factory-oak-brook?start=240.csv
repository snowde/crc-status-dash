Rebecca C.,"Chicago, IL",232,588,72,4.0,11/20/2013,"As corny as CF is, I've never had a bad meal there. The cheesecake is delicious and there are so many tempting kinds to try and the dessert menu changes often, perhaps too often - although, the mainstays remain. I like that the menu has calorie busters and very low cal choices, all of which are presented well and taste good. While CF's prices are a bit steep for a casual chain, it seems the competion has stepped up to the plate and they're all the same. It's relatively easy to spend $50 for 2 to have lunch and $70 for 2 to have dinner."
Nicole C.,"Fort Collins, CO",202,3,,1.0,11/9/2015,"I am extremely disappointed in this Cheesecake Factory location. I am from Denver, and visit the Cheesecake Factory a couple times a year, always having a great experience. My visit today was extremely terrible. After seating ourselves at a bar table, we had to wait quite a while for service. When our server Pam finally came over, we ordered 2 mojitos and 3 appetizers. Our food came out before our drinks did. Our server didn't even bother to come over and say anything to us about this, or even ask how our food was. We then found out by asking another server that Pam was on a break..?  Our mojitos tasted like sugar water and the food was mediocre. I will never go to this location again. Very disappointing. All this happened with about 20 people in the whole huge restaurant."
Callie W.,"Downers Grove, IL",180,12,,4.0,5/20/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory is great, I have always been a huge fan! The menu is literally a book, so there is something for everyone (even a ""skinnylicious"" menu for healthier options). I would recommend the orange chicken or the Chinese chicken salad (It's HUGE!). The cheesecake is to die for but the meals are usually too big to save room for a piece! The only reason I gave Cheesecake Factory a 4/5 stars is because the wait time can be lengthy, especially in the evenings and they don't take reservations, so you will show up at 5:00pm thinking you have beat the dinner rush but end up waiting 30-40 minutes. When this happens, we usually go across the street to Mon Ami Gabi or Maggianos, so we don't get to eat here. However, overall, awesome food!"
Lisa C.,"Elmhurst, IL",0,7,6,5.0,2/17/2014,"The s'mores cheesecake is TO DIE FOR. Same with the Reece's PB cup.  As far as food, the pasta da vinci is always my go to. Great combination of flavors of the grilled onions and creamy wine sauce. Amazing.  And don't forget the brown oat bread! Always fresh and delicious.  I've never had a poor experience at Cheesecake Factory before. Highly recommend it to anyone!"
V.i.o.l.e.t.t.a. D.,"Chicago, IL",40,66,14,5.0,10/15/2013,"I was so utterly impressed with this place. I've been here a number of times and always felt the food's wonderful but this last experience was exceptional all around.  When we got seated our very friendly waitress came over and greeted us warmly, and when I asked her about a certain menu item being gluten free she didn't know right off hand but the manager was right next to us and he knew right off the top of his head the exact ingredients in the dish that made it unsafe for a celiac to eat. I was very impressed..our waitress said they had a meeting about gluten free food and how to avoid cross contamination..for someone with very bad food allergies it's heavenly to hear that. I decided to go with the shepherd's pie and it was out of this world! I can honestly say it was hands down the best thing I have ever eaten...ever. I demolished that plate without an ounce of guilt. I ordered a gluten free beer and even contemplated eating their gluten free cheesecake but I was already struggling to breathe haha  Seriously, this place is a gluten free paradise. They have ruined me. I dream about that damn shepherd's pie.  I will have you again pie..and when I devour you I will not worry about being ladylike. Mmm..."
Michelle P.,"Yorkville, IL",0,2,1,1.0,9/6/2015,"Today I got a to go order of cajun chicken and shrimp pasta and it had no taste. I called the location and spoke with the manager on duty named Chris and he was rude as ever. He explained to me the dishes are to be consumed right away. This explanation took me by surprise seeing they have a to go area and it doesn't state that. Although in years past I have enjoyed dining here, however I've begun to see a change in the quality of product. So my visit wasn't enjoyable and my advice is only get cheesecake to go not the food.  Furthermore, if you have an issue don't speak with the manager Chris as he has no customer service skills. So you be the judge I won't keep going back on the name of a restaurant if I can't receive quality service 100%. You judge!"
Frank B.,"Itasca, IL",3,80,,4.0,12/15/2014,This is a great restaurant. Beautiful place with excellent food with great service. We've been here dozens of time and we have never had a bad experience here.
Joe M.,"Walled Lake, MI",227,1077,232,4.0,3/19/2014,This is my new fav place to eat. Great Gluten Free Menu. I had the shepherds pie. SOOO GOOOD. WOW. I loved this place. The staff was very knowledgeable  about Gluten.  I felt like they cared. For sure will be back.
Katie S.,"Villa Park, IL",0,2,,2.0,1/24/2015,"Well where should I start, first off it was about a 90 minute wait for two people and the wait did not stop there. Took about 15 minutes for a beer and sangria to get to our table and then the habachi steak without mushrooms we ordered medium well was burnt and had mushrooms. Our server Megan was beyond amazing though asked if she could fix anything for us. Then the manager stopped over and told us our cheesecakes would come out faster than normal. We laughed because at that point we've already waited enough for everything anyways. Coming from the industry ourselves, we know how things work. The only thing good about our meal was Megan our fantastic server. Such an asset to your company, everything else on the other hand..could use some work."
Jin Joo L.,"Lisle, IL",446,155,83,1.0,10/17/2014,"Where do I even begin?  I don't think I've ever had it this bad at any restaurant except one, ever!  Usually I love Cheesecake Factory and they are always friendly, professional, and food is great.  Well, I guess not all restaurants are the same.  As far as the Oak Brook location, I'm very scared for them.  I've never experienced anything less than great from the Woodfield location.   I went in for lunch on a Wednesday afternoon.  My friend showed up late so we sate around 1:40 pm.  She came around after a few minutes to get us water and drinks.  Then at some point came by to take our orders.  We've been catching up so we requested a few more minutes, not a half hour!!!  She didn't come or show her face for another 30 minutes.  Took our order and finally gave us bread.  Now remember we sat at 1:40, but I was waiting there for my friend since 1 pm!  Imagine how hungry I am. Took our orders great!  Food come out in another 20 or so minutes.  My food is ok... tomatoes are a bit mushy.  I got the Chicken Avocado Club... my friend got Orange chicken.  His was so badly cooked he couldn't eat it and sent it back.  I believe the rice and flavors were somewhat burnt tasting and was not tasting normal, and he's had this dish many many times.  So another 10 minutes before we could find someone to take it back.  Few more minutes to come ask take another order.  Instead of lunch he settled for cheesecake.  She came back with the check and left it there.  I admit we talked for at least another hour or so but, she never came by for at least an hour and half to even check on us.  Maybe filled our waters twice during our entire meal.  I have no idea why it was so hard to get any service at such a restaurant with many servers.  It was as if she either didn't care much or just didn't want to show her face.  I don't know whatever her reason was, but it was unacceptable.  Usually, I'd call over a manager right away, but seeing how bad service was, I was afraid the manager wouldn't manage as well either.  So instead, sadly, being a past server and manager myself, I never do this but I did not leave much tip.  I won't say how much but just simply wrote, ""Thank you for the bad service,"" on the receipt and left.   Maybe a manager will see this and hopefully they will manage a bit better or check on their guests a bit more?  With so many employees, why was it so hard to do their jobs?"
Sam M.,"Warrenville, IL",32,139,185,4.0,1/24/2015,"The wait times here are ridiculous!! Waiting an hour? Good thing we had a gift card, because otherwise we would be having pizza somewhere. The food is usually so-so. However, I have finally found a dish that I really enjoy. The Romano crusted chicken was amazing, thin, lightly breaded chicken with some pasta was lovely. Hubs had the bang bang chicken and shrimp and was not impressed at all. We usually get the jambalaya; I'm glad I tried something else. And what better way to top off a delicious meal than with the mango key lime cheesecake. Aaaah :-)"
Andrew M.,"Palatine, IL",31,208,12,3.0,9/17/2013,"Met some friends here for lunch on Sunday around noon. We sat in the bar at a high top. Our waitress was attentive, and kept our glasses full for the majority of the meal. It took us a long time to choose our orders because we were catching up, and the menu is like 30 pages long... Seriously who needs that many options?  Anyway I had a couple tall Honker's Ales as they were on tap. I ate the Chicken and Biscuit meal. The biscuit and gravy was excellent while the chicken was so-so. The mixed veggies and mashed potatoes served with it were also pretty good. It was the 1st time I have ever finished a meal at the CF without feeling like I was going to explode.  My wife ordered a side caeser salad (love their dressing), and a lunch portion of a sundried tomato and chicken pasta. When her pasta was delivered, it was covered in a cream sauce which was not mentioned anywhere on the menu (interesting as they have plenty of space for that kind of detail). She requested they make her a new one without cream sauce as she is what I lovingly refer to as a lactard (lactose intolerant). The waitress that dropped off the pasta said something along the lines of ""well it always comes with cream sauce on it."" Which I thought was pretty rude, but I let it slide. Our actual waitress came over, apolgized for the mixup and took the pasta to have it remade as requested. The manager also stopped at our table to apologize and offer to bring my wife a complimentary soup which we politely declined. When the bill came they did remove the pasta from the bill which was appreciated. The other couple we met ordered the buffalo burger (burger with fried onion straws, bleu cheese, and buffalo sauce) and the chicken avocado club. Both looked delicious.  Overall, the experience was pleasant. The good thing about cheesecake factory is you seem to always get exactly what you would expect. A menu with way too many options to choose from, giant portions that you shouldn't finish (but probably will), average to slighlty above average service, average food, and outrageous cheesecake (if you had the will power to not eat your entire meal)."
Younis Y.,"Justice, IL",29,18,5,3.0,4/22/2015,My opinion is this place is overrated. Yeah the cheese cake is great but the food is whatever. Way overpriced  again in my opinion. I tried to see what others see but the long waits and pricey food ruins the experience. I would still come here with others but definitely not a first choice. No special trips to the cheese cake factory for me.
Tobias L.,"Flagstaff, AZ",9,8,,3.0,6/2/2014,The Oak Brook location was easy to get to with lots of parking. Was staying close by for a few days and had dinner elsewhere prior. Stopped by for desert and coffee only. Coffee was good but desert was just OK.   Nice enough place over all with staff trying hard. Have had OK experiences w the chain in the past for dinner and will likely be back sometime when convenient but probably  not for desert.
Kristen E.,"Chicago, IL",46,31,11,3.0,4/16/2015,"While I love their cheesecake and appreciate the variety on their menu, it is very frustrating that they don't accept reservations. I have waited for a table for almost an hour. The lobby gets very crowded so even if you go in to just get cheesecake, it's very chaotic. I think if they took reservations and organized themselves a little more, they would get 5 stars!"
Chris J.,"Naperville, IL",131,117,35,5.0,3/26/2014,I'm not huge on Cheese Cake but this place is great. I've come about 8-10 times a year and enjoy the selection of food they have (Hibachi favorite). Desert are good as well. Service is great and the cheese cake is good! Only downside is it's usually packed at all hours. Parking well it's Oak Brook expect to drive around for awhile.  Great place for most occasion from family to dates it works.
Angela C.,"Cincinnati, OH",87,154,106,4.0,8/6/2013,"I ate here just the other night during the half off cheesecake special and it was CROWDED. We luckily found a table in the bar area and only ended up with a 15 minute wait. While we were waiting, I had a delicious blueberry mojito! Only complaint? I wish the blueberries were fresher.  We tried the avocado, zucchini and portabello fries and the were quite tasty indeed! Other things eaten: fried mac n cheese balls (not good the day after), hummus and pitas (a LARGE amount of hummus), southwest chicken sandwich (very tasty!), red velvet and smores cheesecake, southwestern egg rolls, and a couple other things I can't remember.  I think the cheesecake factory does a great job with their menu. Good portions, well prepared and great combinations of flavors. I haven't been disappointed thus far and I'll most likely go back in the future!"
Beth P.,"Lombard, IL",94,155,44,4.0,5/22/2013,"We came on a very busy Saturday afternoon and were looking to seat eight people, two of which were children.  The staff was very accommodating and sat us at a very large table.  (nothing is worse that trying to squeeze that many people into a table that should really be for six).  Our party sort of trailed in which might be a little difficult for the waitress, but she was great.  She had iced tea ready and waiting for the late arrivers and gave us ample time to get settled and look at their ginormous menu. We had the spinach and artichoke dip and calamari for appetizers - both were tasty.  I was happily surprised that they now have a Skinnylicious menu that provides different calorie categories.  I ordered the seared tuna tataki salad.  It was delicious and just the right portion, which made me feel a whole lot better when I then split the scrumptious cookie dough cheesecake with my husband for dessert :)"
Scott D.,"Aurora, IL",85,2,,2.0,6/4/2016,"the food was good ... when we finally got it.  Brought my family there 6/2 for my daughter's 18th bday dinner, as it was her choice.  we were there about 6:15-8:15PM.  My daughters wanted to eat outside which was fine; except I wish restaurant could figure something out with their umbrellas (8-9 feet in the air)- during the evening hours they provide absolutely no shade.  As a result, anyone facing south/west is staring directly into the sun the entire meal. But that was our choice.  Service was extremely poor, and it was NOT that busy.  waitress was nice enough, just not attentive between us getting each ""course."" Took abnormally long times to get each item we ordered ... drinks (soda/ice tea), our appetizer, the meal... and the crowning disappointment - over 20 minutes to get 2 slices of cheesecake.  2 of my girls ordered steak tacos, no Guacamole ... one came with big dallops of guac on each taco; but we had waited so long at that point she just scraped it off. Then to add insult to injury, my other daughter ordered spaghetti/meatballs.  Which was very good - large portion.  So of course she took leftovers home -probably more than half the serving.  The next day when she opened her package hoping to finish her meal before she ran off to work, - yuck!  they gave her someone else's leftovers.  It was pasta - but not the spaghetti she had... which can only mean another customer had a similar experience when they opened their leftovers.  It was not only frustrating, but kind of gross to think about it.  The prices are already just a bit high for what you get (in my opinion), but then to lose an entire serving of leftovers; enough to say - nope - next time we'll go to one of the other restaurants directly across the mall drive"
RASHIDA J.,"Chicago, IL",16,37,31,4.0,3/15/2014,"Fav place!! So much to choose from but I still have a solid list I work from. Stuffed chicken enchiladas, kale salad, angel hair pasta & shrimp, shrimp bistro pasta, bang bang shrimp app. Can you tell I like shrimp? Torn b/w the plain & banana cheesecake. The carrot cheesecake used to be awesome until it was changed from a layer of carrot w/a layer a cheesecake to cheesecake w/chunks of carrot cake. No bueno. Oh yea! I cannot forget to mention the turkey burger is also tasty for the non-meat eaters."
