Elv A.,"Bolingbrook, IL",0,65,87,4.0,4/22/2015,Try their jambalaya or steak medallions. We really enjoyed the food.   Their red velvet cheesecake is also delicious.
Matt M.,"Forest Park, IL",1151,1157,27,3.0,8/18/2011,"I forgot when Cheesefake factory turned from a family style restaurant into a snooty ""upscale"" italian style restaurant. Whenever it was it was a day that will forever be labeled as a catastrophic error in strategy.  Your business model is not impressive. You way overcharge for food thats quality is essentially macorni grill and you are the baker's square of cheesecake. That means you should be somewhere in those caliber of dining establishments. Prices and light fixtures are unable to convince me otherwise."
Bill S.,"Addison, IL",7,51,55,3.0,4/17/2015,"It's really 3.5 stars but can't do half stars here. Anyways parking is difficult and they don't take reservations so wait times are ridiculous sometimes. The bread in the beginning is quite good. Drinks and beer are pricy so save your money and go to pour house across the street. They unfortunately do not give complimentary cheesecake for your birthday , bit of a shame. Had chicken teriyaki it was so so. Tried the nachos and spinach dip. Decent flavored.Greek salad I liked it really was well put together. They have wide menu but nothing stands out out of the world tho aside from cheesecake. Casual place with family in the mall. Service is good have never had a problem. Cant wait for the patio seasons but granted you get all the gas in your face from driving by cars."
Markisha B.,"Hoffman Estates, IL",2,2,,4.0,9/26/2014,"Had a quick management meeting after work around 10pm tonight and decided to go here and grab a bite to eat while we discuss work. Waiter was Mark.,. He was great! Very courteous and friendly. Checked on us multiple times but didn't over do it. Food came and was hot & delicious. Although they closed at 11, no one came to rush us out which I appreciate. They let us enjoy our food and talk. We respected their time and didn't stay too long after closing.  Great service tonight!"
Zach N.,"Boston, MA",50,114,,3.0,4/22/2013,"I had my first Cheesecake Factory experience this weekend. My girlfriend loves the place and insisted we go. I try not to be snobby, but I have high standards for food. My date was quick to remind me that it's The Cheesecake Factory, not ""The Food Factory."" Noted. We were starving so we got the fried cheese off of the ""small plates"" menu. Mozzarella sticks, essentially. They were good though. In fact, they were probably better than my entree. I got the fish and chips. True to Cheesecake Factory lore, the portion was massive. The fish was decent, but the breading was a little thick and doughy. It was served with a fist-sized portion of coleslaw and tartar sauce. Provided the breading wasn't too thick, a piece of fish with tartar sauce and a forkfull of coleslaw made for a pretty good bite. My girlfriend got the shrimp and bacon sandwich. It was giant. Triple decker. Lots of lettuce. The shrimp were grilled, and unfortunately they were insanely overcooked. The sandwich had good flavor though. Anyways, one comes to the Cheesecake Factory for the cheesecake, right? So we got some. She got the new Oreo one, and I got raspberry chocolate truffle. Hers was total overkill, but delicious. Mine was a little more traditional, and excellent. I'd definitely go back for cheesecake, but I don't know about this place becoming a staple in my list of go-to restaurants.  Notes: The place is MASSIVE, yet at 4PM on a Sunday it was still a 15-20 minute wait for the two of us. Also, I'd estimate that 85% of the massive menu is deep-fried. They have a ""skinnylicious"" menu with lower-calorie options, but the Cheesecake Factory is 100% an all-American eatery, both in methods of food prep and in portion size. Take that as you will."
William B.,"Wheaton, IL",3,4,,1.0,8/16/2014,IF I COULD GIVE ZERO STARS I WOULD!  We have been going to this restaurant for more than a decade and generally are pleased every time. This was nothing short of horrific!  We ended up sitting at a table near the bar area-possibly the first problem. Server gives attitude to my wife and son while I am away apparently. Food comes and my son's order is wrong--somehow they mistake pizza for Mac and cheese; Madeira good as always. They say they will get pizza. 15 mins later we ask another server to get us bread and check on our pizza because we have not seen our server. Oops-- they never put the pizza order in. Our server finds out and apologizes and says it will be right away-first order in kitchen and promises us they will cover meal and a couple pieces of cheesecake. Meanwhile she disappears again and I go up to bar to get refills for water and Cokes for our table on several occasions--not the most pleasant group there but fine.  Another 15 minutes--no pizza and more self service on the drinks. I lost it and went to look for a manager. He ends up getting us a different waiter Brandon B who was very nice--but the damage was done. Then the 'manager' actually has the gall to reduce the comp for the bad service; he takes off the small pizza and 1 slice of cheesecake that we had to get 'to go' because it was now late and we had been done with our food for 30 minutes.  I get it--some people probably complain and take advantage of you--but that wasn't me so you need to figure out a different way to identify abusers.  That comp for that bad of service was weak--frankly you should have paid me tonight--that's how bad it was.  To put it simply--Your service sucked tonight!  I hope to finish off my gift cards from this place at another location but frankly nothing is real convenient from Wheaton. We may suck it up for a few times more but you definitely lost a loyal customer tonight. You need to replace your servers and managers-- go across the street to Maggiano's. They seem smart enough to hire pleasant ones.
G V.,"Rochester, MN",21,28,40,4.0,4/2/2014,"Yum Yum!  This time I will start with dessert - dulce de leche and the red velvet cake was to die for!  Any Cheesecake slice should be shared otherwise you might end up visiting the ER and get a single or double bypass because its too cheesy rich!  :) For meal we had the jambalaya, chicken madera and bam bam thai and they are all delish!  Only thing to watch out is both the chicken thai and madera are sweetened dish so if you are not into sweet then this dish may not be the right one for you!"
Colin C.,"Alexandria, VA",195,573,10,3.0,6/25/2013,"Everyone knows Cheesecake Factory so I won't waste your time going into too much detail. I will talk to this specific location though. We didn't have to wait the usual hour here usually and always find the food and decor better here than the other locations. Service has been just sort of ok but nothing egregious.  Menu is the usual overwhelming gigantic mess but at least there are options for everyone. I recommend using the small plates or apps to make a meal. It saves money, still lots of food, plus you will have room for a cheesecake. The latter can easily be split among three people or two depending on how hungry you are. This also limits the resulting obesity and diabetes. Overall, everything tasted great and I have had no complaints here."
Dana L.,"Elmhurst, IL",8,26,2,2.0,3/26/2015,"Food was good, but the service was unbelievably slow. Drinks were brought out at different times, some it took roughly 15 minutes to get. Kind of ridiculous..."
Lori K.,"Willowbrook, IL",0,5,,1.0,3/10/2016,"I went here for lunch with my daughter. We ordered our food and once the food came mine was not what I ordered, I guess the waitress put it in wrong and told me it would be right up and apologized. My daughter got a filet, and it was bad, a quarter of it was fat and a filet usually doesn't have any fat, especially for $30. My daughter was almost done with her food by the time mine came, a cheesesteak sandwich, it was pretty gross too, super greasy. I thought well maybe they would give us some sort a discount or something(free dessert maybe), but no nothing. We got some cheesecake to go and that is probably the only decent thing about this place, but $35 for 4 pieces of cheesecake, it should be good."
Mike C.,"Bensenville, IL",0,2,,1.0,4/25/2015,"My wife and I frequently eat here and love the food. My wife is celebrating her birthday today, she asked to eat here and due to plans we would need reservations. Unfortunately you can't just walk in and get a seat..... You have to wait almost 30 mins for a seat! So I asked to"
Marc R.,"Woodridge, IL",0,1,,1.0,10/5/2014,"My wife, son and I went to the Cheesecake Factory tonight.  50 minute wait but we knew that is part of the deal. After being seated, we order drinks - Sangria for my wife, Long Island Iced Tea for me and strawberry lemonade for my son.  My drink was awful! It tasted like 15 sour lemons squeezed into a glass with a splash of brown liquid.  Undrinkable! Asked for manager, and was presented with Christopher Johannsen, who said he was sorry I didn't like it. It was it that I didn't like it - it was that it was the most horrible cocktail I have ever had the misfortune to sip!  I asked for a Diet Coke instead. Dinner comes.  My wife's skinny steak is fine - my skinny enchiladas look good as well.  However, no cheese pizza for the son.  Christopher comes out - again - to let me know it will be 5 minutes.  We decide to eat as my son doesn't care if we do, and after my second piece of ""chicken tooth"" (or gristle - whatever you want to call it) - I was done.  Set the plate aside and explained to waitress that two bits of enchilada spit out pretty much soured me on the whole experience. Pizza finally comes.  I ask to speak to the manager again, and I suggest that as pizza was late, my food and drink were nauseating, and our whole evening and experience was a disaster, that Christopher not bring me any bill whatsoever.  Christopher, in his infinite manager wisdom, would have none of that and offered to comp my drink, my dinner, and the pizza, but not the entire thing.  We discussed this back and forth and I made it clear I would not expect to be paying ANYTHING but ol' Christ would not hear of it.   I explained this to the waitress and asked if there was a ""real"" manager I could speak to.  Eventually some other older guy came over, and with no attempt at an apology, or even a fake act to show that he was at least concerned about our experience, told us to go ahead and not pay and just leave.  So we did. What a disaster!  It's obvious that the Cheesecake Factory is so large that they don't care about a customer here or there, so that is why I was so surprised how hard it was to get them to comp our lousy meal.     I hope everybody reads this and forwards to the awful management staff at that restaurant but I doubt they would care."
Robbie M.,"Woodridge, IL",295,23,1,3.0,3/5/2015,"Just wanted to share a very odd experience. I visited with a party of 15 that was split into 2 tables. That was not the issue, we didn't make reservations. However, our waiter was very forgetful and unorganized. He constantly asked each guest at our table what they order. He was complaining about a medical condition with the nerves in his leg or something. He brought out dishes that no one ordered. We laughed about it for the most part but this kid did not seen equipped to be working as a waiter ... anywhere."
Blue L.,"Chicago, IL",1,13,,1.0,2/7/2015,The wait time is unbelievably rediculous!!!! I cannot believe it takes that long to eat! we waited almost 2 hours after being told the wait was 50 minutes. On top of everything they messed up our order which was just the cherry on top of a horrible experience.....will never return to a cheescake factory ever!!!! not even for a cheesecake!!!
Graciela S.,"Woodridge, IL",15,49,17,3.0,8/17/2014,The only reason this review gets a three instead of a two is because of our waiter. He was awesome. But the server tried sitting us in the middle of two other tables... Uh no. We asked to be moved and she gave me attitude. Then I order avocado egg rolls. There's these little plastic pieces in it... Okay. I am usually shy to complain so I didn't mention it. What seemed like 30 minutes later our food arrived. My eggplant sandwich fell apart when I picked it up. I was so upset. I waited so long for the food and it sucks that it instantly was inedible. Boyfriend said something to the waiter and he was awesome. He comped us and brought out a different meal(after another 20/25 min) . Also the manager came and apologized. Really appreciated that. However it took us two hours to dine there due to the wait of food. Was pretty disappointed. Oh well.
Anna T.,"Chicago, IL",0,9,,1.0,5/28/2014,"Not happy. I needed a quick lunch to carry out, so I called Cheesecake Factory. Here's what transpired: Person #1: Hi! How can I help you? Me: Hi, I'd like to place an order for carry out please. Person #1: Sure! Let me transfer you to our curbside line. *on hold for 3 minutes* Person #2: Hi! How can I help you? Me: *repeats above * Person #2: Sure! Let me transfer you to our curbside line. *Getting seriously annoyed now. On hold for another 4 minutes *  Person #3: (with thick accent) hi, how can I help you?  Me: yes! I'd like to order a soup and salad please. #3: ok what kind of dressing do you want? Me: what do you have? #3: (unintelligible, partially because of the accent and partially because she's talking so fast) Me: I'm sorry, can you repeat that? #3: (unintelligible again) Me: I'm sorry, you're talking REALLY fast. Can you go a bit slower?  #3: (apparently gives up, because asking her to be understandable is too much): Your total will be ($) and it will be ready in 15 minutes. Me: Um, I'd still like to know what kind of dressings there are please. #3: (FINALLY slows down enough for me to catch a few words, from which I can figure out my options). Me: ok I'll take the vinaigrette please. #3: It'll be ready in 20 minutes. *click* I get there (I love how after picking my dressing the time I had to wait magically went up by 5 minutes) and they forgot the bread (when I pointed this out they actually looked in my bag to make sure I wasn't lying before giving it to me.) The soup was bland and the bread was stale. Thanks Cheesecake Factory for mediocre food and worse, deplorable customer service. Why you would have someone with an unintelligible accent taking to-go orders over the phone is beyond me, but to have that person be extremely rude as well means you've lost a customer."
Benjamin R.,"Chicago, IL",0,489,,4.0,1/2/2015,"I have said it before about this and a few other big chains, but stop pretending like you are too good to like Cheesecake Factory. It is -objectively- delicious. That is all."
Roxanne E.,"St Paul, MN",3,50,3,2.0,9/22/2012,"Arrived at 5:00 on a friday as most of our group had very early flights out the next day.. Our party of 5 was seated right away. The restaurant was incredibly loud. The music was pounding. We could barely hear each other talk. Add a screaming baby and you have bedlam. Our waiter had a plastered on smile that never moved. However his eyes never actually looked at us. He kept scanning the restaurant for who knows what. The waiter lined us up with two glasses of water each. This was our first sign that he did  not intend on coming back very often. We ordered appetizers: grilled artichoke, calamari, corn cakes. The artichoke was good, the corn cakes were excellent and the calamari was sub-standard, I ordered the Moroccan chicken. It was good but not exceptional. My friends said their food was ok, but not really remarkable. We finally were able to flag down the waiter to order deserts. One of our party asked if there was a cheese cake sampler. The waiter replied ""That would defeat the purpose."" I have no idea what that meant. We ordered two desserts and requested five plates and forks so we could split the deserts. The waiter returned with three forks. No plates. No forks for the other two people in our party. We asked again for the plates and two more forks. We never saw him again until he delivered the bill. Final total was about 48.00 per person. Not worth it. For that price I expect good service and a nice atmosphere. If it was this poor at 5:00, I can only imagine what it was like later in the evening."
Allison M.,"Bethlehem, PA",536,1213,177,4.0,6/27/2011,"Had a great experience coming here after a visit to the Morton Arboretum! We arrived on the early side, around 5ish on a Friday night, and were seated immediately in a booth by the bar area, where we were informed that from 4:30 to 6:00 pm, we could order the normal portions of appetizers for $5 (about half-price).  We decided that was a worthwhile deal, and planned our eating accordingly, since the portions really are enormous here.  The two of us split an order of the guacamole appetizer (medium spicy, which was perfect), as well as an order of the garlic noodles.  We finished the guacamole, had some bottomless free refills of our diet cokes, and ate about half of the garlic noodles-- leaving enough for one person's lunch the next day! (Albeit, a ridiculously salty one-- the garlic noodles tasted like a metric boatload of butter, garlic, and salt; my boyfriend and I both agreed that the asparagus was easily the best part of the dish!) We got the Chcoolate Tuxedo Cream Cheesecake, which was to die for.  Went home happy and full. The restaurant definitely feels like a chain (hence the 4, not 5 stars)... but I have only good things to say about it!"
Madison B.,"Oak Park, IL",0,75,1,3.0,2/25/2013,"Went there on Saturday afternoon.  This was my first time at this location.  It is huge!  Just like every Cheesecake Factory, we had to wait for a table.  This was  my first turnoff.  The line of people waiting to eat was out the door.  Anyway, we waited the 30 minutes for a table and had lunch.  The food was decent.  I've had better at the downtown location.  I'm not complaining about the food or the service.  I'll be back.  When we left out the door, the line had quadrupled.  The overcrowding really turned me off.  Next time I come, it will be when they first open (but I've heard that there's always a line at that time too...smh).  Oh well, the things we do for a decent meal. Oh, and the menu is over 20 pages!  That never bother me before, but now I think it's insane.  How can their chefs/cooks master the menu when there's so much on it?"
