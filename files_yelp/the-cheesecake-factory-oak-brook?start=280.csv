Yari P.,"Schiller Park, IL",6,24,1,3.0,7/18/2014,"The herb crusted salmon is great! Their drinks are good.  The Mai Tai's are delicious!!!  But..... strange how this place is called "" The Cheesecake Factory"" but the cheesecakes aren't all that great. If you are going to name your restaurant after a dessert, that dessert better be perfection. LOVE the decor though."
Andrew B.,"Chicago, IL",3,28,1,2.0,12/10/2014,"Good food with great cheesecake (as expected.) however ordering online has its issues and almost every time they have messed up my order. Overall it's a nice chain restaurant to go to when in need, but with all the other great restaurants near by I would recommend going elsewhere."
Shawn L.,"Richmond Hill, Canada",46,64,1,4.0,10/26/2014,"We went in as a large group.  Food was very great but the server could not handle a group with food coming out randomly, some not at all and the bills took 45 minutes to get and pay.  The manager corrected as best he could and my seared tuna salad 5 stars on its own"
Natalie F.,"Naperville, IL",82,98,309,5.0,9/16/2010,Ok I just have to say The Cheesecake Factory has never dissapointed me. They are just that good and they have a huge menu which means lots of choices. Ok maybe too many! The prices are a little high for ME so going there is def a treat! I have been TRYING to stay on the low carb diet again so trust me I was happy to see a few low carb cheesecakes listed! Yummo.  I really enjoy the cobb salad there. I was so happy that the waiter I had asked me first which size I wanted. I guess the larger size feeds like 4 people. Dang! :)  For the Oakbrook location you want to get there early like by noon during the week. I have not gone there on the weekends. I have been to the one on Michigan Avenue in Chicago a few times during the week and on the weekends. It's the city so of course that one is always CRAZY. I will def go back there again.
Jessica L.,"Rowland Heights, CA",264,49,111,4.0,11/3/2014,I'm a big fan of cheesecake factory! They have excellent food and desserts!
G Q.,"Aurora, IL",55,132,,1.0,11/29/2015,Went for a holiday lunch this past Saturday and was very disappointed to see there wasn't one holiday decoration up yet. I hope this is done very soon.
Sandra J.,"Glen Ellyn, IL",0,14,,4.0,2/2/2016,"Best food and appetizers!! I've gone to Cheesecake Factory several times, but the pasta dishes at this one are wonderful! Desserts are always good, of course. The bread is actually one of my favorite reasons for going lol. Went last night with a couple girlfriends and we just had the greatest time talking in that beautiful ambience, stuffing our faces. Afterwards we sat at the bar and had a great time with some delicious drinks. Really nice for any occasion, from birthday dinner to girls night out!"
Dan T.,"Chicago Ridge, IL",18,30,,2.0,10/13/2013,"My party of four arrived at the Cheesecake Factory about 6:50pm on a Saturday. We were told that the wait would be 50 minutes, so we decided to hang around, and were seated within that time window.  The ambience of this location is interesting. It's reminiscent of an Italian cathedral with high ceilings, buttresses, and sconces on the walls. Our table was in the corner of the restaurant, in a large circular area that provided a nice intimate feeling.  The waiter was quite attentive. We ordered Chicken Madeira, Chicken And Biscuits, Chicken Carbonara, and Chicken and Shrimp Jambalaya over Fettucine. I was a bit surprised that dinner didn't include a soup or salad option. Our meals arrived in a timely manner - or at least most of them did. Three of the dishes were brought out by the runner. We waited about 5 minutes, then I found our waiter and informed him that one of our party was still waiting for their plate. The FOH manager came by and I informed him of the missing dish. He disappeared for a few moments and brought back the missing entrée - all without an explanation or apology.  A few minutes later the waiter came back and explained that this particular runner had forgotten dishes at least twice that evening. The waiter said that he had informed the kitchen manager of the problem as well. The rest of the meal was uneventful, and the dishes were very tasty (although my son, who had the Chicken and Biscuits, became violently ill that night). I realize that sometimes there are issues - however, a simple apology from the manager would have gone a long toward a higher rating. If we do Cheesecake Factory again, we'll try another location."
Dan B.,"North Riverside, IL",48,11,10,5.0,11/30/2014,Always great food and great selection. Very big portions too. Try and save room for the cheesecake! Service was great too very professional staff. Must go again
N S.,"Chicago, IL",19,13,9,4.0,7/12/2012,"Nothing says Happy Hour like good food at a great price. That is exactly what the Cheesecake Factory offers with their half-price appetizers everyday during Happy Hour from 4 - 6 pm.  Thankfully, the Cheesecake Factory has not succumbed to pulling the Happy Hour Bait & Switch routine like many restaurants in the area which only provide a limited selection of small portioned foods or watered-down drinks during their Happy Hour.  The Cheesecake Factory offers the full portion of their appetizers for half price. The only downside is that you have to sit in the bar area and sometimes seating is limited.  With so many dining options in the Oak Brook area it's nice to see that a restaurant understands the importance of quality and value. This combination truly makes it a Happy Hour."
Demetrios M.,"IL, IL",4,23,14,1.0,11/13/2014,Food was terrible.  Ribeye steak tasted like hamburger.  Kids pasta was cold.  Greek salad had almost no feta and was only about a cup full of salad.  Server only came to bring the food never checked in or brought drinks unless we waved her down.  Will not be back
Danielle S.,"Schaumburg, IL",13,1305,73,4.0,6/20/2012,"Well...I've been to a number of Cheesecake Factories, and this is just the same as all the rest. Let's be serious. They don't change. Big menu (I LOVE the skinny menu they have now!), huge portions, and great desserts and drinks. They are pricey - especially their drinks. I don't like how they don't put the price on the menu for their drinks. That's deceiving.  But the atmosphere is nice, our server was nice, and you get a lot for your money. We didn't have to wait that long which was shocking for a Saturday night dinner. You also want to park in the parking garage next door - the parking lots are a nightmare. I know I'll end up going back because I get the itch every now and again!"
B W.,"Chicago, IL",7,14,7,4.0,11/22/2014,"Went in at 5:45 on a Friday and only had a few minute wait! Our server was super friendly, food was good... As usual too much for just one meal."
Rosie V.,"Downers Grove, IL",0,3,,5.0,1/4/2016,"I'm giving 5 stars for the server Rubi. She was the best server I have ever had. Our party came in late, but she was so friendly and accommodating. The food is just alright, but the decor is so fun. Honestly this woman needs a raise. Thanks Rubi for such an enjoyable experience!"
Melissah L.,"San Francisco, CA",63,285,9,3.0,6/13/2012,"First of all, this restaurant is massive.  The ceilings are sky-high and the building is beautiful.  It feels like a pretty classy place.  My table got avocado spring rolls as an appetizer, and it was very yummy! (I think I found a mock-recipe on Pintrest, must try!)  My boyfriend got the Thai chicken pasta and I got the fish tacos.  Both were good-tasting, but for reference I would compare it to food you could get at Chili's or Applebees.  The others at our table ordered the garlic noodles and the eggplant sandwich... I'm not sure what they thought but everyone ended up cleaning their plate or bringing home leftovers so I have a feeling it was all pretty tasty! Of course, we got cheesecake for dessert, and the b-friend and I shared the mango key lime flavor.  Deeeeelish-- it was easily my favorite part of the meal.  It was light (as light as cheesecake gets, that is) and the fruity touch was a nice way to end our night.   Oh yeah, but we went there on a Saturday night and the wait area was packed.  Luckily we only had to stand around for 20 minutes or so, but if you are in a rush I would try somewhere else."
Yadi R.,"Chicago, IL",1,23,2,1.0,9/11/2015,"I love coming to this location to get my fave, key lime cheesecake.. But today totally turned me off.. For one my cheesecake tasted like it was old?? As instood there waiting for my slice i noticed a lady out of uniform behind the counter cutting, preparing plates for customer dining in all with out gloves on! She touched someones cheesecake to arrange on a birthday plate!! Then continues to put her bare hand in the container containing toppings!! So disgusting!! When i complained, i come and find out she is from their corporate office?? You would think she would know better.. Unacceptable.. Id give 0 stars but yelp wont allow it..pppfffff"
Olivia C.,"Villa Park, IL",9,9,,3.0,11/15/2014,Ok as we all know the food here is delicious. However each time I have gone here the service is questionable. I'm not a needy customer but I do get a little annoyed when I have to wait for water and bread and I see others getting it right away. This has happened each time I've gone to this location. I still go back because I love the cheesecake. I don't expect being served like a queen but the basics wouldn't hurt. When Someone comes into a restaurant chances are they're really hungry just bring them bread right away. It might seem small but it makes a huge difference in a dining experience.
Nicki S.,"Hammond, IN",1,9,,1.0,12/29/2014,"I recently visited this location for the first time a couple weeks ago and was not impressed. I went back a second time this past weekend (some friends wanted to go) and let's just say I will never be going back again. I ordered a veggie burger and the next day I had food poisoning! After doing some research, this veggie patty is supposedly egg free which  means there is nothing in the patty that should cause sickness. The only logical explanation left is clearly severe mishandling and food contamination. I am absolutely disgusted thinking about what I ate. Besides their low food standards, the wait for a table was an hour at dinner time unless you were able to snag a table in the bar. If you are lucky enough to get a table in the bar, you end up surrounded by people ready to pounce on you the second they see your bill arrive so they can cut their wait time. The service was decent but took awhile for drinks to arrive. Overall just a negative experience for me."
Dennis L.,"Sterling Heights, MI",91,488,206,3.0,1/8/2011,"I have always liked the Cheesecake Factory, but I had never been to this location.  My lunch visit allowed me to try an excellent app and two wonderful small plates.  I was a bit skeptical about the Buffalo Blasts, but they were as good as the description made them sound.  For my two small plates, I had the Vietnamese Tacos and the Roasted Pear & Blue Cheese Pizzette.  Both were absolutely delicious. Overall the experience was a good one.  The service was slow, especially during the lunch hour.  4 stars for food, down to 3 stars due to the service."
Amy L.,"League City, TX",1,8,,1.0,5/15/2015,"Disgusting jerks who think its funny to make fun of people who are disabled. I was staying at Le Meridian (less than 100 ft away from the restaurant) and called explaining to them that I could not walk and was hoping to get a delivery. The first manager Garth put me on hold 5 times before coming back laughing hysterically saying that no they would not do that. I asked if they had a service (Grubhub, Fooda, etc) who could help me and he repeated ""we will not deliver to you"". After speaking to the wonderful people at my hotel they said they would go and get it so I called back and spoke to Olivia, she put me on hold 3 times before abandoning me there the 4th time. Finally I spoke to manager Renee who with all the attitude in the world told me basically I was SOL because they weren't taking my CC over the phone and unless I was physically present there was nothing they would be willing to do to help! UNBELIEVABLE! Since when is it okay to talk to customers or potential customers this way? Since when do we not try to help customers who are disabled and unable to do things the way everyone else does? Do they really believe I wouldn't WANT to show up at a restaurant like a normal person? The staff has left me in tears. So next time you would like to go there please think of someone you care about who may be disabled and think of how you would feel if they were stuck alone in a hotel room and the restaurant in the same parking lot not only REFUSED TO HELP them but made fun of them and laughed at them like what they were asking was some kind of a joke. Up yours Garth, Renee, Olivia and The Cheesecake Factory. YOU are the disgrace, not me."
