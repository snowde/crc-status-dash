Ericka A.,"Chicagoland, IL",1239,1524,2735,3.0,2/25/2010,"You cheap, cheap bastards. Garlic does NOT equal flavor. Their food wood be quite good if they would just season it lightly and lay off the pounds of garlic. And I'm a garlic lover! While the food is decent, there is no consistency. I've always liked what I've had, but keep finding that I order the same thing and sometimes like it more than other times. The last time I went there they must have decided that they don't care about their customers. I was going to get a few pieces of cheesecake and wanted to make sure they would put the raspberry sauce they usually do. They said it comes with that. Then I decided to save some money and get an entire cake. The cakes come frozen. She made sure they had the right cake and I asked for the sauce. She said the whole cakes don't come with the sauce. Are you F-ING kidding me? I'm paying $32 and you can't give me some sauce? What is it, 50cents? You're going to begrudge me half a buck? I call BS!"
Tamera B.,"Plano, TX",196,214,174,4.0,12/3/2012,"We've been going to Cheesecake Factory for years, but this is my first review. I have to say that Cheesecake Factory is one of few restaurants that consistently rocks in all aspects of a dining experience. The service is always great, every dish we've tried tastes very good and is well prepared.....seafood, beef, chicken....whatever you like. They even have a ""Skinnylicious"" menu that is equally delicious as the regular menu. The portions are huge. The cheesecake is extraordinary. This is definitely one of our ""go-to"" restaurants when we want a guaranteed good meal."
Tiffany L.,"Plainfield, IL",7,39,4,3.0,7/13/2014,"I always like the food at Cheesecake Factory. So the food and service were fine. However, I did have to take a star away because the floors were dangerously slippery. Especially holding a young child, we were super careful with walking since we kept slipping as we walked. Luckily, no falling but we did mention to a few staffers. One even said something to the point of ""tell me about it. I've almost slipped a few times already."""
Nicole L.,"Carol Stream, IL",181,105,123,4.0,2/26/2013,Cajun Jambalya Pasta ALL THE WAY!!!! A little bit on the tangy side but I love it!!! =)
Peter S.,"Burr Ridge, IL",7,57,8,4.0,4/8/2014,"Lunch for two on a Monday.  First time at a Cheesecake Factory.  Nice crowd. Decor a little gaudy.   They started us with warm bread and big glasses of water.  The bread was good.  The dark bread had a tinge of sweetness.  We ordered the meatloaf and the shepherd's pie.  Both were very generous portions. The meatloaf was good and came with mashed potatoes and succotash.  The meatloaf and succotash were spicy. The shepherd's pie was the best made with beef I have ever had. They used plenty of ground beef and it was filled with a lot of gravy and vegetables including mushrooms, carrots and peas.  The mashed potatoes were topped with a thin coating of melted cheese.   The service was attentive and friendly, although the shepherd's pie does take a little longer.   What we ordered was really a dinner not a lunch and we were stuffed.  So we took a couple of original cheesecakes to go to have with a lighter dinner that night.  And it was excellent.  We will return."
Stephanie G.,"Chicago, IL",54,151,12,3.0,5/13/2012,"My sisters and I wanted to take my Mom here for Mother's day weekend. They don't take reservations on the weekend - What????? As a result, my sisters had to go and put our name in at 6:30. The wait was 1 hour and 45 minutes. I picked up my mom at her house at 8 pm, and as soon as we arrived we were seated. It was great for my Mom and I, but my poor sisters had to wait the full hour and 45 minutes!!  Luckily, we were not in any kind of rush. Our server was so overwhelmed with tables. We were told it was their second busiest night of the year. It took 20 minutes to get our soda's and waters. When our food came out, they forgot our order of sweet potato fries. The server told us they would not be on our bill (since they finally came out when we were boxing up our food).  When we got the bill, not only were the sweet potato fries on it, but so was the $3 diet coke that my sister paid for when she got a drink at the bar during her nearly 2 hour wait. We had to explain to the server that the bar tender made it clear that her drink would have free refills once she go to the table. Our server apologized and took off the drink, fries, and our dessert. As he should have!!! We were at our table for full two hours. It was definitely a slow dinner, but luckily we did not mind since we did not have to be anywhere."
Berenice T.,"Chicago, IL",24,156,158,5.0,10/30/2012,I love their cheesecakes! I took my now husband there for his birthday and they gave him a free slice with decorations around it stating Happy Birthday. It is a bit pricey but well worth it.
Trinia T.,"Orland Park, IL",5,35,,3.0,7/31/2014,"Food was good as always, but the service sucked.  Slow service, served cold bread, when asked for warm bread, they microwaved it.  Just seemed very lax in attention"
Sara B.,"Wheaton, IL",12,1658,13,3.0,10/13/2010,"I have only been to the Cheesecake factory a couple times. Once I was blown away, but this time I wasn't. Of course it was really busy but it took a really LONG time for anything. Water, drinks, salad...The company I was with had a small child and it was a little overwhelming to just sit and wait for everything. The server was funny but not really working.  I had the country french salad and wow, it was amazing. The food has always been delicious but the service here was something lacking."
Sandy K.,"Fox Valley, IL",82,88,1,2.0,12/19/2011,"Awful service. Not to be a baby, but at one point I felt  the""angry tears"" coming on.  See, Hubby and I haven't had a chance to get out in a long time. I tried for rezzies at some more upscale places like Wildfire and Gibsons but I was out of luck. We settled on the Factory but I wasn't dissappointed because I was in the mood for eating and was looking forward to the dessert.  This CF has a really amazing ambiance. It's pretty dramatic and I'm an ambiance girl for sure so that was a plus. The place is ginormous.  Soon as we were seated our server walked up to us and barely looking at us mumbles that he isn't going to be our server for long because he'd already been there all day! Practically warning us that our service is going to be shotty. GREAT! Just what I wanted to hear on our one big night out. He takes our food order, we order a bottle of wine to celebrate a night away from the kiddos and the server comes back to TOSS a basket of bread on our table again without even looking at us and walks/ no runs away. We didn't even have any bread plates. He avoided eye contact with us each time he quickly walked past so we ended up eating our bread off of our napkins. SUCKY! Sitting there like hostages still without our wine, and eating bread off of napkins, we hear the two different servers on either side of us entertaining their guests with the specials and soups of the day which we of course heard nothing of!! Damn because they sounded interesting. After about 10 minutes our food is brought out (which is faster than the last time I went to Burger King) by another server whom I've never seen. Then  Mr. I-CANT-WAIT-TO-PUNCH-OUT-FROM-MY-SHIFT-SERVER makes eye contact for the first time and he introduces us to our ""NEW""  server who is now the third person we've seen. Three of them at our table and not one of them notices we never got our wine, had no bread plates, no water.. they are fine with it and ready to get rid of us asap.  And there is where my ""angry tears"" almost started.  Hubby and I were thinking about forgetting the wine but server #3 promises to get it. After server #2  and #3 do some bumbling and bumping into each other all confused like for a minute, #2 finally brings the bottle after we are well into our meals.  It was stressful, annoying and I felt pretty angry that our bill was over $100 with tip for two people and we were treated like we were at Chilis, where our bill is usually half that. Wait, We get MUCH better service at Chilis!  I had the Bang Bang Shrimp and it was good, It was like a sweeter version of Panaang, if I am ever forced to go to the Factory again that is what I'll order. Cheesecake of course was fantab as always, no complaints there."
Ream Q.,"Tinley Park, IL",0,29,8,3.0,9/19/2015,"Tiramisu is great. Service is terrible. Put on hold for 15 minutes to make a curbside order. Then, when I went to pick it up, waited on hold and took total of 20 minutes to get my order. I was told it would be ready in 5 minutes for pick up."
NaKetha K.,"Aurora, IL",43,52,30,4.0,7/31/2014,I really enjoyed this location.  Weekends are a bit busy and it's first come first served.  The staff was great and as usual the food is delicious. I always get one or two slices of cheesecake to go. Overall great establishment.
lorry t.,"Chicago, IL",2,32,,2.0,6/25/2015,"Very unsanitary on busy days. I been here a few times because of their decent food and prices. Never again will I be back. last time I went on a Sunday it was pretty busy, waiters kept bring out food to the wrong tables! Happened to me and a few other tables near me. There was a couple next to me that received my food. She poked it and told waiter it wasn't what she ordered so then they passed the plate to me, I didn't notice until I was half done with the food that the girl that received my good was sick and of course I became sick after I ate it."
Katie D.,"Lockport, IL",54,187,40,4.0,9/13/2010,"-1 star for the slow service & long waits. The menu is like an entire book, you can basically get ANYTHING there. I dream about the chipotle chicken sandwich. The burrito is gigantic and delicious. The hibachi steak is also fantastic. Last but not least, I think it was the spicy chicken pasta I ordered last time and it was mediocre. I'll stick with my usuals... If you go there and get something that you don't particularly like, give the place a second chance! There are sooo many things to choose from. I always want to try something new but I can't get myself away from that chicken sandwich... HOW COULD I FORGET....the appetizer, I don't know what it's called but they're cheezy buffalo chicken strips of heaven. I highly suggest these."
Christina C.,"Las Vegas, NV",98,27,1,5.0,3/12/2015,"My favorite food item is Cheesecake. Literally, you can't go wrong with cheesecake. With that being said, it was a night I did not want to cook and forced my boyfriend to go to cheesecake factory with me. Of course he agreed. Cheesecake factory is usually pretty busy, which I hope, the majority of people would understand. So yes, I had to wait. Yes, the food took a little bit of time, but that's what you're supposed to expect on a weekend night. So it didn't bother me at all. When I got to my table, I was greeted with a friendly server. He recommended some great food items. At the very end of it, I asked my server to come up with some mystery shots for me and my boyfriend, and I still have NO idea what I had to drink, I drank 2 glasses of merlot before I had that shot, and I am not a heavy drinker. He came back with the shots and I asked him for the dessert menu! The whole purpose of my visit was for the cheesecake. And yes, I saved room for it. I think it is an amazing place, with amazing staff. I had a great experience and most definitely enjoyed my white chocolate raspberry cheesecake :)"
Kelly D.,"Downers Grove, IL",20,107,73,1.0,6/8/2014,Overseasoned food over crowded. Not worth the money. Take a slice of cheesecake to go.
Erik H.,"Elmhurst, IL",35,88,7,4.0,11/30/2012,"Gordon Ramsay would have a stroke upon seeing the twelve pages of menu.  However the Cheesecake Factory somehow manages do do most of it very well.  Options range from healthy to extremely fat and calorie laden, and most portions are ginormous -- which I guess one can view as a pro or a con.  Personally, I am a big fan of their seared wasabi-crusted tuna, but have not had anything at the Oak Brook location that I felt was poorly prepared or bad.  And then there is the cheesecake -- too many varieties to count. The only downside is how crowded this location is most evenings, every weekend, and often during the lunch hour.  Waits can be very long. I also do not entirely understand the egyptian-looking decor; though it is unique and attractive. Bon appetit!"
Christine B.,"Chicago, IL",0,1,,1.0,10/8/2015,"Our party of four went to the Oakbrook location last Saturday night. This was my first time visiting this location, we live near Old Orchard, and go to that one frequently. We arrived at 7:25pm, the lobby was packed. We were told it would be a 60 minute wait, ok , no problem, it is Saturday night. They had run out of pagers, so we were told to come back for one in 30 minutes, but were assured we were on the waiting list.  We received the pager about 30 minutes later and assumed it would be about another 30 minutes to be seated.  After about an hour and a half my husband went to check and was told 10 minutes. We had to go back and remind them we still waiting two more times before we were finally seated at 9:30.  What really burns me is that I am convinced we were never on the waiting list to begin with, instead of just admitting they had made a mistake, and seating us as soon as possible they acted like we were being unreasonable.  When we were finally shown to a table, the lobby was empty and a couple that had just come in was seated before us! By the way, no apology.  Needless to say, we will never go back.   Christine B."
Stephanie H.,"Chicago, IL",121,279,73,5.0,7/17/2012,"This has always been one of my favorite restaurants.  The menu has a very wide variety, so there is something for everyone.  The cheesecakes are amazing.  Try the original cheesecake.  I know people go there for the other ones, but this one is terribly underrated.  The Factory Peach Bellini is also amazing.  It makes me want to be on a beach in Mexico."
Vishal B.,"Lombard, IL",96,289,135,4.0,5/19/2012,"Yes.. you will have to wait to be seated, sometimes for an hour or more.. so plan accordingly because its a popular place that has the beeper system, no reservations! They offer valet parking which is nice for a special evening, then again, its loud inside as their seating capacity is upwards of 400.. ( i think).. For first timers... that giant book is not the next Twilight installment, its the menu.. I found it odd they have advertisements in there but so what, they have everything from Italian, Mexican, Asian, etc.. all with a ""everyone will like it"" American way about it. Ive had quesadillas, the burrito which is the size of a forearm, Evelyns favorite pasta, whoever she is.. got it right. Pizzas are also good, lettuce wraps, the eggplant sandwich, different appetizers including these fried cheese balls which were freakin amazing! As you can see, the bigger the group you go with, the more variety you will get to sample as the menu is huge, Ive never been for breakfast/brunch but seen that omelet menu and need to wake people up early enough to come here on a Sunday for brunch!  Entree portions can be large, so share along with conversation, take your time, and I cant stress enough how important it is to save room for Cheesecake, as if the name didn't tip you off. Red Velvet Cheesecake is their understated best hands down, the tiramisu cheesecake, dulce de leche, original with strawberry, or even the unique reeses peanut butter cheesecake...or the rich Godiva cheesecake.. with a latte or cappuccino.. They have a special Take out section just for picking up cheesecake on the way home from work... if you're avoiding the wait, and the noise. Even with 4 stars, this is one of my Favorite restaurants in this area!"
