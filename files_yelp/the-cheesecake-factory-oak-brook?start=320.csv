LaToya A.,"Chicago, IL",9,36,,4.0,8/10/2015,"I love the Cheesecake Factory. I hadn't been to the Oakbrook location before, but I've been to the one in Dontown Chicago and Schaumburg. The wait wasn't long at all. For a party 3 on a Sunday afternoon, it was only 20 minutes. What was interesting was while we were waiting, a man walked in with one flip flop on and a bare foot. Yes Ii said it, bare foot. No shoe or sock, just toes. He walked right up to the counter passed the 20 or so people who were waiting to be seated and requested a table. Then he took the buzzer and walked out. Our table was ready before his so I wasn't able to see if he ever put a shoe on or not. I thought that was disgusting and the guy should have been turned away until he had both shoes. Eww! Other than that, the food was delicious. I ordered the Jamaican shrimp and chicken, which was very tasty. It was seasoned like it was straight from Kingston. Yummy. The curry wasn't overpowering either, because I'm not a curry fan. Overall, I'd go back but management need to be more aware of their customers attire. No shirt, no shoes, no service. I never understood the purpose of that statement in a store until yesterday. I thought it was common sense to wear shoes outside of your home."
Ashley P.,"Chicago, IL",1,6,,5.0,9/14/2014,I love it here. The Chicken Salad Sandwich is amazing. The Margarita's make life more fun and the Oreo Cheesecake oooh the Oreo Cheesecake. I think every experience I've ever has here has made my life better.
Rommel G.,"Normal, IL",5,9,2,1.0,6/8/2014,"Well, a little disappointing with the service. I don't mind waiting for my table but when they are off by 30 minutes from what they told me that's a little annoying. To compound this, after finally being seated, it's been 15 min now and I'm still waiting for someone to take our order. WTF!!!"
Borat S.,"Chicago, IL",21,94,15,2.0,3/9/2012,I thought it was grossssss. I got the spicy cashew something and it was really salty and the waiter took forever to refill my water.  CONCLUSION: If you like salty nuts in your mouth... This is the place for you.
Vanessa R.,"Berwyn, IL",3,9,,4.0,5/21/2014,"Came here for dinner.  This place gets packed, which I was aware of before even arriving.  we waited an hour and half for a table!  Geeezzz!!! The food was good the steak was a lovely medium rare and the oat bread was yummy. My favorite though was when I tried my husbands orange chicken! Yummy is was soooooo good and crunchy.  The brown rice though was very, very dry! I'll be coming here again minus the children!"
P W.,"Chicago, IL",0,8,,1.0,8/8/2015,I will never eat food here again .  Given sub standard food not what I ordered ate downtown lady next to me had the same thing I ordered in Oak-brook.  Tell me why her order had different chicken and looked fresh .  Let's see I'm African American and she is white .  So do they serve us sub standard food .  It was the spicy chicken tacos tell me why I had little chunks of white meat while her order was topped with avocados and had crispy spicy chicken .  Sad sad sad went to the downtown store today it was no better .  Seems like my salad was old and the fries came off of somebody else's palate
Christina A.,"Chicago, IL",196,102,32,4.0,3/23/2014,"I'm not a fan of cheesecake but this place is delicious, maybe I'm just speaking of the farfalle pasta they have here but it is my favorite dish. EVER! I have literally been eating this dish for 10 years now. No joke. The other things I've tried here are also delicious! If you come for dinner it's always packed and always has a wait. It's a bummer they don't take reservations."
Linh L.,"Chicago, IL",393,642,712,4.0,2/25/2012,I enjoy the ambiance here... The high ceilings and beautiful decor. The service has never disappointed me. Parking is easy too. Last time I was here I got their seafood gumbo and ahi tuna tar tar... Very good. I actually don't like most of their food on the menu!
Katherine B.,"Downers Grove, IL",30,140,107,3.0,4/25/2012,"This place was pretty good but it wasn't good enough to wait an hour and a half for even if we could find a parking spot. We skipped the insane crowd on a Saturday evening and went for an early sunday lunch (which didn't have a wait surprisingly).  The seats that they seated my boyfriend and I at were so close together. I could rub elbows with the people at the seat next to me if we tried and the conversation of the  two girls next to us was so depressing. I could hear everything about each of their friends that had passed away. I'm sorry that it happened and I mean no disrespect to them but I felt so bleh after trying to ignore their conversation.  On the other hand our waitress was really pleasant and the food was pretty good. We had ordered the calamari for an appetizer and it was good. I ordered the grilled fish tacos which were also good. My boyfriend got the Cali cheese steak and he said it was good. The food was just good. Nothing spectacular. The cheesecake though was really good but was pretty expensive. I think it was $7 a slice.  The decoration was really nice, the feel of the place was relaxing, the bar was overly stocked and the menu is huge.  Over all everything was pretty good but I would recommend going on a weekday or a morning."
Kim M.,"Westmont, IL",26,152,39,5.0,2/20/2012,"Best food on earth. Ok cheesecake:p try to fried Mac n Cheese, delicious. Also yummy chicken piccata. Fun seating on the patio in the summer."
Mike G.,"Chicago, IL",9,10,7,4.0,3/21/2014,This is the place if you are a big cheesecake fan. The service I have to say it's always good every time we come here. The food in my opinion is just OK. Nothing special.
Maggi C.,"Chicago, IL",3,160,11,4.0,11/9/2013,"Very busy place - friend had connections and we were seated immediately. Do not like how large their menu is - a book; really? - but enjoyed a glass of wine and their Americana cheeseburger, which was huge. Met up with friends and appreciated the courteous server as well as a place where the noise level was low enough to converse without having to shout across the table to be heard. Pull up the menu before going here and you'll save yourself 20 minutes time spent reading the menu. And - the Key Lime Pie here is magnificent!"
Alicia K.,"Fresno, CA",17,157,45,2.0,5/12/2011,"I'd like to start out by making something clear: in all of my past experiences, I LOVE the Cheesecake Factory!  I've been to 5 different locations in CA as well as one in WI, so I assumed this one would be about the same as the others since they tend to be very consistent in their layout, service, food, etc.  I was so, SO wrong... I would honestly NEVER go back to this place.  We waited an hour for our table at 9pm on Friday night - not unheard of, but pretty annoying when after we put our name in, we watched 3 other parties of two walk in, put their name in, and be seated while we still sat there waiting.  Not cool, people.  The second we complained they said, ""Oh yeah... you're actually next!""  Riiiiight... Then there was our server, Laurie, who was, in a word, TERRIBLE.  She was rude, never smiled, took our cups and appetizer/bread plates before we were done eating without asking us if we were through, and never once stopped by to see how we liked our food, refill our drinks, etc.  Also, after devouring an appetizer and a smoothie before my main meal, I didn't eat much of my dinner and she said in the snarkiest voice I can imagine, ""Guess you're not hungry, huh?""  Seriously?!  SO RUDE.  The food was also meh.  My husband ordered a steak which he has had before at other Factory's and loved.  This one, however, made Applebee's steaks look like fine dining and was cooked all the way through despite a request for ""medium rare.""  My sandwich had fresh ingredients, but the bread was no better than your $.79 Wonder Bread from the grocery store.  Subpar!  And the delicious brown bread they bring to your table when you arrive was day-old at best and in fact tasted rather stale.  Big let down for us.  I will mention that the banana cream cheesecake was as delicious as ever.  At least they have those recipes standardized... The bathrooms were disgusting.  I thought they normally had a schedule and people were supposed to clean it?  You wouldn't know that at this place. Anyway, overall, we didn't leave hungry and the food wasn't terrible, but compared to every other Cheesecake Factory we've been to, it was a horrible experience.  With all the options in the Oak Brook/Lombard area, I would seriously give this one a miss... unless all you want is a really good piece of cheesecake."
Erika C.,"Berwyn, IL",18,47,6,4.0,3/2/2014,"Love this place :-) Red Velvet cheesecake of course is my fav. Among my other favs are the Chicken Costelletta, Thai lettuce wraps, Fried Mac & Cheese (super heavy yet delicious) regular mac & cheese. Always a great experience when we come here. Never walk away disappointed."
Danny Y.,"Westlake Village, CA",8,190,,4.0,11/9/2011,"My usual go-to dish at the Cheesecake Factory is their Sheppards Pie. On this (diet) night, I opted for something from the healthy menu, which must be new because I dont remember seeing this couple months ago. I ordered the crusted salmon, which was a bit of a disappointment. It wasn't dry, but wasn't juicy either. I'll give this a 3/5. Wife ordered the Thai wraps, her go-to dish. This dish is less of an appetizer and more of a meal. If you're into peanut sauce, and making your own lettuce wrapped rolls, you'll love this dish. 4/5. We also ordered the ahi tuna carpaccio, which is probably the highlight of the night. I'm pretty sure they topped the carpaccio with spicy mayo which is brilliant. It was like eating grade-A sashimi, and we LOVE sashimi. Nevertheless, I do want to caution folks and say that while the dish is good, it won't do much to satisfy your hunger. Anyway, the carpaccio is easily 5/5 in my book! Ended the night with an ice cream sundae, which tasted like every other ice cream sundae I've ever ordered (plus whip cream and a cherry). In retrospect, I dont even know why I ordered this, considering I ordered dinner from the healthy menu."
Phil T.,"Chicago, IL",2,9,1,5.0,3/28/2015,Good service. Good food. Try firecracker salmon. Very kids friendly. Also try hot chocolate and pink lemonade.
Fred H.,"Maywood, IL",6,40,13,3.0,1/8/2012,"I frequent particular location. Usually, I'm satisfied with the service. But one particular night, I called in to carry out and they answered and placed me on hold. Needless to say, I drove to the location while on hold. When I arrived and told the hostess that I'd been on hold for 11 minutes, she just replied, yup there you are on line 1. I asked to speak to a manager and she seemed embarrassed and offered me cheesecake. I declined and told her that I'd planned on carrying out but decided to just get cheesecake, which was for someone else. I did leave them a ""nice"" feedback on their website though. One positive thing about this experience, they promptly called me the next day following up on my feedback left on their website. The manager offered and apology and a gift card. Customer just want to feel like you appreciate their business."
F K.,"Chicago, IL",177,48,,4.0,3/10/2014,Been going here for many years. I like their seafood a lot. My favorite is the Miso Salmon and the Wasabi Crusted Tuna Filet. Really good food and massive portions. Plus their bread is amazing.
Joseph P.,"Chicago, IL",43,83,,3.0,1/27/2014,They have some good food but it can be so fatty and unhealthy.  I am not talking about the desserts but the dinner menu.  I really enjoyed their cheese steak but other than that everything is just ok to me.  If you like fattier foods then you might enjoy this place.  Desserts are good though.
Christina J.,"Fort Walton Beach, FL",39,301,34,4.0,8/28/2013,"This was my first time at The Cheesecake Factory and I was not disappointed. I'm glad because it was for an early birthday celebration. There was a wait time of 30-45 minutes if we wanted to sit indoors, so we chose immediate seating out on the patio. Our server was helpful when we asked questions, our drinks were refilled often, and the food was amazing! I loved the bread they put out as well. The menu is gargantuan. I did research the day before so I wouldn't take 3 hours to figure out what I wanted once we sat down. I ordered the Crispy Chicken Costoletta, a strawberry lemonade, and a slice of mango key lime cheesecake. Everything was good. I left satisfied. It is on the pricey side, but not too bad. I'd go back even if I wasn't being treated."
