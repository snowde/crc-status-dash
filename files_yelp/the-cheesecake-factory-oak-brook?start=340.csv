Claudia M.,"Elmwood Park, IL",352,266,311,4.0,10/13/2011,Three words....Pumpkin pecan cheesecake!  Delicious!
Rosalinda F.,"Berwyn, IL",0,26,,3.0,2/22/2012,"Cheesecake Factory seems to have something on their menu that someone will like and if you go with a group, it seems that most people will enjoy it. All of my 6 co-workers really liked it. I have not been to the other locations, but I have been told that this Oak Brook location is big compared to the others. For my taste, I thought the food was only okay. I went with my family and we ordered and tried a little bit of each others food. Food - The warm crab and artichoke dip was very good. I ordered the Big Bang Shrimp and Chicken. For me it was not spicy enough and a little bit on the sweet side. The portabella burger was not that special, although I did like the sweet potato fries. The Spicy Beef was okay, but I did not think it all that different from something you could get at a regular Chinese restaurant. Desserts- Well the desserts were indeed good, but I think they lack a balance. For example, I ordered the Lemoncello torte and it did have a strong lemon flavor, but it overpowered the mascarpone cheese it had in it. No balance in the flavors, although it was good. The Godiva Chocolate cheescake was indeed very strong in flavor, but again I though the chocolate overpowered the ""cheescake"" flavor and so it was just a pure chocolate flavor and no ""cheesecake"" flavor. It was very creamy though. I did not try the tiramisu, but heard it was good. I think the portions are big, but it's embarrassing to admit that my family is able to finish all the food on his/her plate. Although we took our desserts to go because we were full.  Prices - seem a little high for food that was not bad, but not overly spectacular either. Still, I may go again and like I said, it seems most other people I know love this place."
Michelle D.,"Westmont, IL",17,7,,3.0,5/22/2012,Food is amazing ! Had the Ahi tuna small plate and it was the best I ever had! 30th anniversary cheesecake is to die for! Out server was supper friendly. I only give it 3 stars because I felt like I was siting on-top of the people next to us. Food and drinks took forever !  I still will be back to give it another chance.
Bella J.,"Chicago, IL",43,46,2,5.0,11/21/2010,The Cheesecake factory is my favorite place to go when i really want quality food. It has a long waiting time especially on evenings but its worth it. Their pasta is fantastic. I usually order different type of pasta and it rarely disappoints me. I dunno what they put into these meals but they got me addicted! And for the desserts all I have to say that any chocolate cake will do it. I do not eat much diary products that whys i go with chocolate cake instead of cheesecake. The cakeis rich and delicious mmm... I want one now!
Susan marie C.,"Conway, SC",92,72,17,3.0,2/27/2011,"While I love the Lettuce Wraps, my last experience was not so great.  Myself and 2 friends went there last Sunday (in the pouring rain I might add) for lunch.  As usual....very long wait....won't seat u unless everyone in your party is there, even if you are willing to start your tab with drinks while waiting. However, I do get it. One of my friends ordered Lettuce Wraps also. I always order with extra chicken so I can bring home leftovers.   When our lunch was brought to us, mine had 2 extra thin strips of chicken! TWO FOR $3 OR $4?????? SERIOUSLY?  Our waiter even questioned it.  I told him NOT TO CHARGE ME...to that he had a very sassy comeback....then, 10 min later, shows up with 3 more strips. I will try a different place in the future for my GIRLFRIEND MEET UPS for now. I'm tired of that over priced place anyway!"
Tiffany F.,"Western Springs, IL",0,3,,4.0,3/29/2015,Love coming here with friends on weekends for dinner! The Red Velvet cheesecake is to die for!! Only complaint I would say would be the caesar salad dressing had way too much garlic and was very overpowering.  It is also very crowded and you are guaranteed to wait at least 15 mins even during the week. The Oak Brook location is always packed so make a reservation if you have a large group going.
Chris M.,"Bolingbrook, IL",0,8,,2.0,3/23/2015,Too pricey!!  Food is never good.  Wait time is ridiculous!  Why does everyone like this place??!!   This place does not take reservations!!
Osiris V.,"Lombard, IL",1037,676,1372,4.0,6/19/2009,"The Cheesecake Factory never dissapoints me. Their menu is HUGE!!So I always find something. Sometimes I find more than one thing and then I have to chose :( The burgers are Ginormous, one of my favorites. Their plates are pretty generous as well.  I've actually have never had their cheesecake. Oops. I've gone there for lunch and had to leave because it was too crowded. Other times we are lucky and find a spot at the bar. Dinner is no better. The wait at around 6 is an hour, but it's worth it!"
Michelle C.,"Riverside, IL",27,123,9,3.0,9/9/2011,"This is your typical Cheesecake Factory; if you've been to one, you've been to all. No great shakes here, just American fare food with Asian and Mediterranean inspired dishes. They have a good variety on their menu, and the location of this Oak Brook location can't be beat. We were able to sit outside on this day too, which was nice expecially because the chairs outside are pretty comfy.  However, the HUGE downside to this visit was the insane amount of times the server came around. I like good customer service anywhere, but when I'm out to lunch with a friend deep in conversation, the staff should take a cue and leave us alone. Even my friend made a comment to me about it, and I'm ususally more critical than she is.  Would I return? Maybe if I'm in the area, but I live int he city and won't go out of my way to eat here."
Margaret G.,"Chicago, IL",54,119,7,2.0,1/19/2013,"Cheesecake Factory's menu boasts an all inclusive menu. You want a burger. No prob. Salad? Sure! Tacos? Coming right up! Fish? Ok we've got shrimp, salmon, or tuna. If one can't find anything on the menu that suits you, clearly you aren't hungry enough. They serve a myriad of classic meals without any innovative twists and serve any kind of cheesecake you could imagine.     Why the 2 stars?     Holy hell bad service! We celebrated two of my friends birthdays, filling up three of the big booths in the back of the restaurant. We had a large group. Our server waited on two of the booths. On multiple occasions during our meal, the server seemed clueless, overwhelmed, and just no where to be seen. And it is at times such as these, where an automatic 18% tip is added that really gets my goat. Upon the main dishes being served to my booth of 7, my friend was left empty handed. So we all sat and waited, expecting her burger to be following close behind. 2 minutes passed. 5 more. 15 minutes! No waiter. No food. WTH? Finally her burger arrived brought by a wait staff not our own. No apologies offered. Two of my friends needed a to go box for their slices of cheesecake. Where is said waiter? MIA. After finally becoming inpatient with the nonexistent service, my friends gets up from the table and fetches containers herself.     Theme of the night- Incredibly slow, inattentive service that kinda put a black cloud on my whole experience. Maybe I'll give CF another chance, but doubtful. So many restaurants, so much better service."
Thao N.,"Wheaton, IL",76,53,97,4.0,6/24/2011,"I've never left disappointed, just very full and happy.  As far as chain restaurants goes, I'd say Cheesecake Factory is one of the better ones. For the price, you get huge portions and the flavors are always on point.  Being called The Cheesecake Factory, they really do live up to their name when it comes to those slices of heaven. My favorite right now is the Red Velvet Cake Cheesecake. Layers of red velvet cake and cheesecake toped with cream cheese icing and white chocolate shavings. YUM!"
Tom L.,"Elmhurst, IL",5,76,9,4.0,7/29/2010,"Portion size that is out of this world!  The food always comes out very hot and the service is good. However, stay away from the mixed drinks.  They're overly sweet. Stick to beer and wine at this place.  Or just water..."
Sara F.,"Chicago, IL",10,49,1,4.0,10/11/2011,"I emailed CCF about this. As a former employee I understand that their main objective is good service. The lady, Colleen, I emailed with was VERY apologetic and offered me a gift card. THERES the CCF I know and love. I will still be PRO CCF. If you have a bad experience, write a letter. they'll make it right."
Noelle V.,"Chicago, IL",20,63,7,5.0,10/4/2012,They are making a Cheese Cake Factory in Orland Park! Can't wait to go there!
Joe B.,"Chicago, IL",25,121,24,4.0,1/3/2013,OK this place is kind of small compared to the Schaumburg location but the service is pretty top notch. the people were very helpful and the menu is pretty standard. the only reason for the 4 stars versus 5 are the seating selections. i personally like booths which i was lucky to receive but the majority of seats are too close to everyone else.
Ray T.,"Westmont, IL",0,236,3,4.0,12/20/2012,"My wife's retirement party was here.  The reservations were for noon.  The place was packed, but the reservation was handled well.  It wasn't long before orders were being taken and the orders got back to the table correctly - individual checks too.  Many places do not like to do this with groups. I am a picky eater and sometimes have difficulty finding items on a menu.  The menu here is HUGE  over 16 pages.  It has a large variety from which to choose.  I had no trouble finding many items that I could eat. The food was good.  We heard no complaints about quality and a few complaints about quantity.  Portion sizes were large.  My wife and I ordered the Kobe burger with salad on the side and onion rings.  The rings were good and abundant.  One order would have been enough for both my wife and I.  Of course the taste of those rings made it impossible to leave any remaining on the table.  A few were given away; the rest devoured.  The Kobe burger was large and good and correctly cooked to order. I arrived before my wife and her coworkers and had a beer in the bar.  The bartender was friendly, service was quick.  We chatted a bit as is common with all good bartenders.  Later when my wife and one of her coworkers arrived, the bartender congratulated my wife's retirement.  Remembering little things is good business.  Table service was good too.  Ordering, food delivery, processing multiple individual checks was handled well by friendly and attentive staff. The decor is attractive and the place is loud, but not so loud that you couldn't hear a conversation several seats away from you at the table. Oh yeah...the cheesecake.   I don't eat any, but my wife is eating one now as I write this.  She took her cheesecake home for dinner.  Others ate theirs entirely or split the cheesecake - half for eating/half to take home.  They are are big cheesecakes. I just asked my wife how her cheesecake is and she said ""Pretty darn good."" That's really the gist of it ..."
Charles J.,"Oswego, IL",230,138,133,3.0,6/28/2011,"To clarify, the number of stars is based on their overall menu and entree options.  Were I reviewing them strictly on the basis of their cheesecake, I'd give them SIX stars. Cheesecake Factory is hugely busy, which should be an indication you'll get a decent meal and, if you have any room left in your belly, outstanding desserts! I've eaten dinner there several times and have always left stuffed due to their gargantuan portions, but seldom ""wow'd"".  The food, if not the portions, is somewhat pedestrian.  It's a touristy place, especially the Michigan Avenue location to be sure so expect long waits (they don't take reservations). My secret to getting right in is to avoid prime time.  Go during a week day or mid-afternoon, when everyone else is out doing something else.  Your chances of getting in right away improves dramatically. Our most recent visit was to the Oakbrook location for dessert only - specifically, CHEESE CAKE.  I can personally recommend the Chocolate Tuxedo Cheesecake.  Fabulous!  Others in my party loved the Raspberry Truffle and the Caramel Cheesecake. So, level set your expectations accordingly; 1. prepare for a long wait for a table. 2. expect a mega menu. 3. expect the food to be OK but not live up to the hype of the place.. 4. save room for cheesecake! 5. expect an expensive night out."
Lizzie B.,"Naperville, IL",46,5,,2.0,7/19/2014,"Been here on a few occasions, and I will say the last time was the absolute worst. Sure, the cheesecake is great, however, the staff is rude and unfriendly. We came during a dinner rush and sat near the registers where many of the staff would gather to input orders and print out receipts. This was fine until we could hear the rude remarks the wait staff was making about other customers, and then later we heard them complaining about our party. After we had asked to speak to the manager, we were treated worse, and the manager did not even give a care and simply wrote off a single entree and gave a meaningless apology. During the dinner, I had gone to use the restroom and found that only one stall was clean; the other had someone's period and tampon on the ground and around the seat. I immediately told the two hostess's and explained how awful it is and how it needs to be cleaned up and that the toilet paper also needed to be restocked. First, they were rude because I had interrupted their personal conversation, and second, they barley took attention to my complaint and then waved me off. I understand how working in food service is, and how stressful it can be. However, this is incredibly unacceptable. I expected more professionalism and a cleaner environment, especially for the price that is being paid. Sad to say, I will not frequent this restaurant again due to this awful experience and handling of this disastrous evening."
scam p.,"Chicago, IL",0,12,,1.0,7/18/2015,"Horrible service. Won't waste my time with this place ever again. Last year around this time I called this place to make reservations for 25 people  the lady on the phone was very ignorant  and basically said to take my business elsewhere . I called back and spoke with a manager to make a complaint  the manager was apologetic  and offered a discount the next time I came in . I  wasn't looking for a discount I just want them to appreciate their customers more. I have not gone back to that location since until yesterday what a mistake that was I called to make reservations for 25 people, the lady that answered the phone said they do not make reservation but to just come in because they were not busy. When we got there we were told that we would have to wait about an hour and a half to be seated in separate areas. Unfortunately with a large group  it isn't that easy to just leave to another restaurant so we chose to wait . While we waited another large group walked in and told them they had reservations the lady told them their seats we're almost ready. After I heard that I asked to speak to a manager and was basically told they do take reservations  but since I didn't know the persons name I spoke with over the phone they couldn't do anything for me. After about an hour wait they finally seated us that was my mistake we should have just left. The service was horrible, half of my party waited over an hour and 20 minutes to finally get their food the service was the worst I've ever seen anywhere. Never again. I'll give my business to people who actually deserve it."
John W.,"Oak Brook, IL",0,38,1,4.0,10/12/2013,If you go during regular dinner hours the wait is quite long but it's worth it the food is amazing and customer service is an A Plus.
