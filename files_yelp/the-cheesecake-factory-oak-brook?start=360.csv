Joe P.,"Plainfield, IL",0,6,,5.0,1/31/2015,I don't know the waitresses name but she was training at the time. They were great. She made sure our drinks were always full and constantly checked to make sure we were o.k. I ordered the mushroom burger medium rare and my brother ordered the chicken Alfredo both were very good. We both ordered cheesecake to go. I would definitely recommend eating here. I'll be happy to come back and try something different.
Timothy H.,"Aurora, IL",15,6,,1.0,12/13/2010,"I have never experienced worse service from a restaurant.  The entire staff clearly just doesn't care.   We walked to get get take out cheesecakes.  This place has a special cheesecake to go counter.  When we arrived, the restaurant was not busy; nobody was waiting for a seat, and there was only one other person in front of us waiting for cheesecake.   Of the two registers used for to go orders, one was used exclusively for making change to servers.  The person operating this registered never acknowledged me or the people in front of me.  She did seem to be having interesting conversations with her co-workers. The person operating the one functional register did not take orders.  She left the people in front of us standing for quite a long time.  She did not acknowledge their presence, nor did she appear to be doing anything else.   After waiting 15 minutes for the people in front of us, we asked to speak to a manager.  No manager came.  We asked again, and no manager came. We left without anyone having acknowledged us being in the store.  The people in front of us still had not ordered. After we left, we called the store and asked to speak to a manager.  We hung up after 10 minutes It is clear to me that the utter lack of customer service is part of the culture at this restaurant."
Christina C.,"Chicago, IL",60,26,1,4.0,7/8/2013,"LOVE LOVE LOVE !!! Their menu has so many diverse and delicious dishes, however the ones that are by far amazing is their chicken piccata and their lemon herb roasted chicken! I am absolutely in love with their garlic sauce for their calamari! Every time I go to a cheesecake factory location I HAVE to get their calamari.  Also, their drinks are always very good! They sometimes taste a little weak but they hit you later on! Also I love their skinny menu since there is also a lot of varieties on there as well!  I would love to give them 5 stars but I hate how you cant make reservations and are always stuck waiting :("
Roger L.,"Oak Lawn, IL",29,25,73,5.0,12/27/2012,I along with a date went to this Cheesecake Factory after a rough night of shopping. Our servers name was Ann or Anne. She was outstanding. Ann was the most attentive server I have ever encountered. Unbelievably warm and friendly. Although the food was excellent I felt as a result of how great Ann was the food could have been dog food and I still would have been satisfied. Now that's good customer service! Thanks Ann and Cheesecake Factory.
Johnny O.,"La Grange, IL",0,6,,2.0,6/5/2012,"Denny's quality food meets Vegas casino lobby decor... The wait was too long at Wildfire so my wife and I went here with a giftcard we'd been hanging on to for a while. The wait was not too bad for a Friday about 5:30p but the place was packed by the time we left. The hostess asked if an indoor table was okay, we said it was, and then she promptly seated us outside.  At least it was a nice night and the view of the traffic in the parking lot was wonderful. We split a chopped salad.  It was ok - there was not as much bacon as I would have liked. I had the Cuban sandwich.  The pork was dry and it was just not very good.  The fries were excellent.   My wife had a chicken and pasta dish.  She said it was gross and ate about a 1/4 of it.  The sauce was orange and looked suspiciously like it came directly from a can of Spaghettios. The server could have been more attentive with our drinks. Bottom line: 1. This is a great place for a gangbanger to bring his girlfriend for a ""nice"" dinner.   2. I am no foodie, but this is not a place I plan to patronize again.  3. Clean bathroom."
Hailey G.,"Wheaton, IL",0,5,,5.0,12/27/2014,Cheesecake Factory has a huge menu and everything is delicious. Their wide selection caters to anyone. I usually get their grilled salmon and it comes with a large portion. All of the dishes that I have tried are great
Hao-Han L.,"Taipei, Taiwan",34,56,178,4.0,4/6/2013,"The cheesecake in Cheesecake Factory is very good! If you live in Chicago and love to eat cheesecake, here is your best choice rather than Cheesecake Factory at downtown Chicago."
Theresa C.,"Naperville, IL",137,427,51,3.0,7/23/2010,"Go for the cheesecake and pass on the dinners. I have been here a couple times. The food is tasty but definitely not worth the price though with that, you always have leftovers at the end of the night. I'm not a huge fan of taking food home at the end of night.  Trying to get a seat anytime on the weekends can be maddening. I would suggest maybe a lunchtime run. Any other time you're fighting with the mall shoppers for a seat and waits can be over an hour and a half. The last time I went here I was a little disappointed. We had ordered the Buffalo wings as an appetizer. When you think Buffalo wings, images of crispy fried wings dripping in hot sauce come to mind. Not here. we had the wings with a tiny little container of hot sauce. Seriously, for two people that was not enough. With the prices they charge for an appetizer, there should be more than that on the wings. I had the shrimp and chicken gumbo for an entree. It was good but nothing spectacular. The Cheesecake Factory is nice to go once and awhile but not an everyday occurrence."
Ishna D.,"Chicago, IL",0,6,,2.0,12/16/2014,I have to say I have loved Cheesecake Factory.  Been there a hundred times I'm sure in five years or so exclusively to this location.  Lately it has not been as clean as times past.  This has been going on for about a year now.  The floor is sticky and each of the last times I've set down I've found caked on food crust on the table or the booth that wasn't properly removed. I know its an in and out type situation but the tables are quickly wiped and particles are sort of flung everywhere and I really don't want the remnants of what someone else ate before me when I sit down.  Just a note and I hope the managers can read this and make improvements.
John H.,"Berwyn, IL",0,1,,1.0,12/9/2014,"I recently came here for a dinner date with my girlfriend. It was a Friday night and it was PACKED! Not only was it hard to find parking but my girlfriend and I had to wait for about 20 minutes before. We got there around 7:30 pm and was seated around 7:45. We were immediately greeted by our waitress who was super friendly. But she was bad at taking away the dishes when we were done eating the bread and appetizer. We put in our order around 7:50. There were two other couples that seated near and put in their order at the same time as us. The two other couples got their food in about 25-30 minutes. My girlfriend  and I were still waiting on our food. Later on, came a family of three that were also seated near us. They put in their order and got their food in 10- 15 minutes. Again, my girlfriend and I were still waiting on our food. The waitress came with our appetizer but it took 1 HOUR AND 5 MINUTES to get our entrées. My girlfriend complained to the manager which took about 20 minutes for her to come. The manager was nice and offered us 2 free cheesecake but there was no excuse on the long wait. We were very disappointed for that it was our first time here. We were starving and seeing other people eating near us was torture. I would not recommend coming here."
Carm B.,"Chicago, IL",38,334,41,4.0,1/2/2013,"Nice location and good customer service.  We were able to walk in and get a table with no wait, which is kind of unbelievable.  I just wish they would cut down the menu a little bit.  It's so hard to pick something.  The cheesecake is always fabulous."
Jeff A.,"Chicago, IL",1164,309,7,5.0,3/1/2010,"I love Cheese Cake Factory! 5 stars means as good as it gets, and as far as chain restaurants go The Cheesecake factory is the best national restaurant chain in America in my humble opinion! I travel all over the country and eat at The Cheesecake Factory everywhere I go...  You can count on it, and when you have a group of diverse people with diverse diets The Cheesecake Factory will deliver happiness! Four of us went out to The Cheesecake Factory last night in Oakbrook, and it was a wonderful meal all the way around! From our Appetizer Cheesecake that we had at the bar while we waited to eat dinner (I have been eating dessert up front for over a decade, its how it should be done!) This is a special cheesecake that I think should become a permanent station on the holy cheesecake menu!  Red Velvet Cheesecake!  Yes!!!!!  Better then you could imagine you must try it! We had 3 chicken dishes and a fish dish, and once again Cheesecake factory has proven that they always make a juicy tender perfect piece of chicken and the flavor is always amazing, I tried every dish at the table and they were all off the hook, although my new favorite Cheesecake Factory dish I think is the chicken picatta! We of course had wonderful wine to boot, amazing service, and a great atmosphere! We of course wrapped up this wonderful evening with another piece of glorious cheesecake, it rocked!"
Julia S.,"Bloomington, IL",64,158,102,4.0,1/21/2013,Food was okay.  Chicken littles are good and honey mustard is good.  Very loud and echoy.  Best part cheesecake!  Duh!  Adams pb cheesecake with tons of pb cup and big butterfinger pieces!  Todd got the chocolate raspberry cheesecake and it was awesome too!  Meatloaf is okay.  Menu is way way way too big!
AllAround C.,"Forest Park, IL",0,78,,2.0,6/4/2012,"My nephew graduated from high school and wanted to come here with family to celebrate. My sister called ahead of time, (problem #1) they DO NOT take weekend reservations. (WHAT? that's when you should take reservations) I arrived before everyone else in our party of 8. I told them 8-10 people, but definitely 8. They told me 30-40 minutes. (Problem #2) An hour and 10 minutes later we are still waiting. Oh Oh, my more outspoken family members are up demanding a table now. (a lot people came in after my party and was seated, they could have put 3 tables together to accommodate our party, which they eventually did) We finally sat down and received 3 free appetizers. (Problem#3) When the check arrived, the appetizers were on the check. (Problem#4) Several members of our family went to the counter to purchase slices of cheesecake ""to go"", the line was ridiculous and the were giving the orders out randomly. The person behind me received his 2 slices before my 1. I was disgusted. The food was good and cheesecake delicious, but service was horrible. It wasn't the waiter, he was wonderful. It was the hostess and the desert counter. Just chaos in the front. It makes me wonder how the kitchen is organized.  They need a stronger manager or hostess, someone with experience working with a crowd."
Carol K.,"Chicago, IL",1292,2723,577,4.0,6/18/2007,"Since this is right across the street from my office- I tend to eat lunch here quite a bit. Each Cheesecake Factory has a theme to it.  I always wondered why they chose an Egyptian theme for this particular restaurant located on the pad of Oak Brook Mall, but it is nice to look at nonetheless.   If you go at lunch- plan to wait as they do not take reservations.  A hint for all of you:  If you don't mind eating at a hightop in the bar and are willing to gamble that no one is smoking- you can be seated right away.  I often do this and have never had an issue with anyone smoking. Their menu is more like a shopping catalog.  Every other page is an ad for something over at the Mall.  But the menu itself if so diverse, that you can find anything you or anyone in your party wants.  Another hint?  Order the luncheon size portion whenever available as the portions are huge!  And always- ALWAYS save room for a piece of cheesecake! (I always plan to do this but never do as I am always stuffed!) The salads and sandwiches are all very good.  Every day there are fish specials (usually salmon and mahi mahi) which you can get blackened or grilled. All in all- a good place to meet for lunch as they turn you around quickly and get you back to work.  Hmm . . .now I wonder . . .is that a good thing?"
Abhay S.,"Chicago, IL",38,271,23,4.0,12/15/2010,"My friends and I ate at this Cheesecake Factory earlier this week.  We arrived around 6pm and were quickly seated.  I was a bit surprised because it was during the shopping season and I figured everyone and their mother would be out having dinner around this time.   Our service was excellent.  Our waitress was very friendly and helpful.  The waitstaff made sure we had full drinks.    Our food arrived in an appropriate time.  I ordered the pulled pork sandwich, and it was pretty decent.   My sides were fries and mashed potatoes.   The cheesecake desserts are flippin' massive.  Be careful if you're going to order one for yourself.   All in, if you're in the area, this Cheesecake Factory isn't bad.  Not my personal first choice, but not a bad place either."
Liz W.,"Belleville, MI",1533,1111,145,4.0,11/22/2009,"Yep a chain but one I have never been to as they have none near me so I was curious. Besides I fricking like cheesecake so I could care about whether it is a chain really. We went for lunch and were happy. The surprise was the food was actually really good. I had a lunch portion of the herb crusted fillet of salmon, it had a very tasty lemon butter sauce and was served with asparagus, instead of potatoes they gladly substituted some sauteed spinach which rocked with the lemon sauce. All in all very happy. My husband had a grilled shrimp and bacon club sandwich and I must confess as tasty as mine was, his was better. Gah huge with lots of shrimp and crispy bacon, lettuce, tomato and a good special dressing on light multi grain-ish toasted bread. He got fries with his and said they were just ok. He gloated about his better overall pick though. He got the chocolate mousse cheesecake which rocked hard. I went with the dulce de leche (hello caramel) and was in cheesecake heaven. My poor arteries. Service was good, atmosphere was pleasant and a good time with no glitches was had. I think we need one of these in Detroit. Stat."
Doris D.,"Chicago, IL",153,210,2,4.0,12/15/2009,"In Oak Brook, you will never ever go hungry.  Ever. CF= Huge portions, huge menu (that might be where the one star gets dropped off), lunch size portions and prices and some excellent drinks. Chain restaurants. Love 'em.  (Matt L., tell 'em how good TGIFriday's really is!???)"
Lindsay M.,"Chicago, IL",195,235,11,3.0,7/20/2010,"It's definitely a place where anyone can find something to eat.. and that it's easy to get drunk off the yummy drinkies. Starting with the martinis/drinks.. a place that uses actual fruit and not just purees or mixes is super plus for me.  They really muddle the fruit for drinks and the taste is purrrfection.   The menu.. gives me anxiety.  Being an indecisive person, it is not ok to give me a menu with 100 things.  I'm not sure the direction the restaurant was taking when they decided to put a plethora of different cuisines on the menu.. but it's kind of confusing and overwhelming.  Also, it makes me wonder how they can have that many items in the restaurant and make everything fresh... I usually always order the same thing when I go here... chicken salad sandwich.  It's really yummy, and I'm picky about my chicken salad.  The last visit, we ordered some of the apps which were like tapas.  They were ok.. nothing too special.  With my sandwich this time, I ordered the veggies and snow peas.. when they came out, it looked like it was in a microwave dinner container and tasted like they were just reheated. Regardless, I usually have a decent time here and it's not to complain about really but nothing to write home about as well. I do have to say, the service here is incredible.  Hands down a very smooth FOH system is going on here and it is much appreciated."
Mark B.,"Oswego, IL",0,4,,5.0,10/9/2015,"Started off with a wait time of 30 minutes.  Was given a pager. My party of 5 didn't mind waiting. After 35 minutes, I went up to the desk to check our status. Was told another 10 minutes. Ok, not thrilled, but ok. At 50 minutes, went back to the desk. Was told they buzzed our pager more than 10 minutes ago, and they kinda laughed that pager must be broken. I didn't really find that too funny. I told the man seating us that I wasn't amused that they should make sure those pagers work. He apologized and gave us a nice table. Not a great start, but it happens. Here's where Cheesecake Factory customer service turns things around. The waitress came to our table quickly and took our drink order and we mentioned we might want an appetizer. She then informs us that the person that seated us was the manager Deion and he took the liberty of ordering us some appetizers to apologize for the pager being inoperable!!  Now that's good customer service. He took what started out as a not so great experience and really turned it around!!  That man knows how to manage!!  He chose some type of buffalo wing chicken tenders, a flatbread, and an egg roll sampler. Everything was really tasty, especially the egg rolls!  Dinner was also wonderful. I had the salmon/shrimp combo and the salmon was cooked perfectly and the shrimp were crunchy and tasty. My sisters all had the chicken in some type of lemon sauce. They loved it!  For dessert, pumpkin cheesecake and strawberry cheesecake. Both were creamy and wonderful. But the strawberry was the real standout!  Service was excellent and we would all go back. Thanks to Deion for making sure we all had a good time!!"
