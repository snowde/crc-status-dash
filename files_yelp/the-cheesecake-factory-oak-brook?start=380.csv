alicia b.,"Lombard, IL",98,229,1,4.0,1/19/2010,"I like this Cheesecake you never have to wait for a table unlike the one in Chi-town.I 've been here several times and never been disappointed.The menu is outa hand gigantic! Its hard to make a decision because there are so many choices.The portions are enormous also! I recommend if your a vegetarian to get the portabello sandwich its so damn good! I actually have a taste for it right now ummm! Most port sandwiches tend to tast the same but cheesecake does something fancy to theres because it has a taste all its own. If you are feeling like being a fatty you HAVE TO order the macaroni balls they are the tastiest,cheesiet balls of joy you will ever have! My mom always gets the chicken romano and she swears its one of the best chicken dishes ever and my dad sometimes gets the meatloaf tower thing which he gives 5 stars! After you consume 3000+ calories you have to get cheesecake!You really have no choice.One+ is that they have a sugar free cheesecake that is suprisinly delish! So get that and you wont feel so bad about everything you ate:)"
Mike F.,"Chandler, AZ",12,901,1,3.0,6/3/2010,"As with every other other Cheesecake Factory, be prepared to pack in the calories.  This Cheesecake Factory is louder than most.  Service is solid."
Tonia O.,"Brighton, MI",105,311,155,3.0,6/1/2010,"I think restaurants with dim lighting are trying to hide something.....hmmm....maybe  the non-de-veined shrimp on my plate. To my horror I ate 1/2 of the shrimp and only saw the remains of its limp little vein hanging. I was almost ready to forgive that one mishap until I ran across another shrimp on my plate wearing a little black sash of disgust. I think I just threw-up a little in my mouth just now. Great mashed potatoes if your into the chunky, red-skinned kind. Decent portion sizes. Interesting decor, aside from the super dim lighting.  Our server was excellent, super attentive and apologetic. The wait time was nil given that we went on a Saturday night. The manager apologized, which I respected. Oversights do happen, its just that my stomach isn't as forgiving as my brain.  I'd definitely revisit and not order any seafood."
Jean C.,"Chicago, IL",94,390,30,3.0,5/6/2010,"I had lunch here on Sunday with three girlfriends and this had probably been my third time. While I am impressed with the huge menu selection, it can be overwhelming when you are trying to decide what to eat.  I ordered the BLT blue cheese burger with a salad. The salad was very tasty. Just the right amount of dressing. The burger was decent but I have had better. I asked for it to be prepared medium and it came out medium well. Not a good start. Although there was blue cheese on it, I couldn't taste the distinct sharp flavor. So all in all, kind of a bland burger.  Our server was good and the interior was beautiful with the Egyptian theme. Parking is a pain on Sundays with all the shoppers so it took me about 15 minutes to find a spot. The company I was with were great and that made for a pleasant Sunday lunch."
Rachel Z.,"Scottsdale, AZ",75,52,56,4.0,4/19/2010,"I've always had a great experience at Cheesecake factory. It is a pretty pricey though.  I think on average if you don't drink beer and you are a liquor or wine person, you will be spending upwards of $7 per drink.   So I always start off with a cocktail.  I've enjoyed their lemon drop martinis and a couple gin cocktails on multiple occasions.  My girlfriends love their mojitos and margaritas. Obviously my favorite thing to eat here is DESSERT!  I do not eat any cheesecake except cheesecake factory cheesecake, its more similar to chocolate mousse than cheesecake in my opinion.  I've sampled a ton of cheesecakes and I love the white chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake, it's my favorite. It's great to eat dinner here, if you get an appetizer and entrees, expect to be taking food home because the portions are HUGE.   I will go back!  :)  If I am ever back in the suburbs of course ;)"
Timothy H.,"Aurora, IL",0,3,,1.0,2/3/2011,"This is the worst. Yes, the cheesecake is good. Really good. The service couldn't be worse. They don't deserve your money. I had a terrible experience when I was last there.  I waited nearly 30 minutes without so much as being acknowledged- even after asking.  There are tons of great restaurants that share a parking lot with this place. Choose those instead."
Laura D.,"Loves Park, IL",5,7,11,4.0,1/25/2013,"I can't say enough how much I love this restaurant! Service is always friendly and helpful, and their menu has anything you could ever crave.  I love each and every cheesecake I've tried, and I'm sure I'll love the ones I have yet to try.  I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 because the wait times can get crazy!"
Quezon D.,"Joliet, IL",27,14,1,3.0,6/13/2010,"Had a great time catching up with a friend over lunch at Cheesecake. The portions are HUGE ! (even the lunch portions) I think this is a plus in my book. You never go home hungry. 1. spinach and cheese dip - good, standard - chips were super salty..  2. renee's special - cup of soup/1/2 sandwich/salad  a. cream of chicken - decent - overkill on the amount of chicken b. chicken salad sandwich - i really liked it, good flavor c. greens salad - standard, decent  I will go again, try some different items... though really liked that chicken salad sandwich."
Brittany Q.,"Antioch, IL",74,185,82,3.0,10/4/2011,"The Cheesecake Factory is your typical 'lettuce entertain you dining experience.  The food is good but not great, the cheesecake, which they are known for is great, if you like cheesecake.  The Cheesecake Factory is notorious for huge portions and meals high in fat and calories. What has boosted this establishment in my view is the effort to change that image. They have established a new skinny menu. The insert to their regular menu includes the calories for the meals , allowing diners to make healthier food choices if they so wish.  I choose to eat healthier and opted to eat off that menu. I had the artichoke appetizer. It turned our fabulous. Very tender and flavorful with out all the added fat and calories.  If you have been avoiding the Factory for the high calories and fat I challenge you to try their new menu. The pricing on this menu is a bit more fair since the portions are smaller, so the proverbial bank will not be broke for dining here, especially at lunch time."
Stephen B.,"Maywood, IL",37,77,,3.0,8/16/2011,"My wife and I were given a gift card from our daughter long ago to go to the Cheesecake Factory. We decided to use it for our 31st Anniversary. We had a short wait before being seated. The decor is interesting and inviting. The workers are plentiful and are kept very busy. The jobs are very specialized. One person took our reservation, another seated us, a third took our orders, yet another person served our food. We had avocado egg rolls with a tamarisk/cashew sauce; fantastic! I had breaded fried shrimp that were really good sized and delicious. They were served with Cole Slaw and French fries. I did not eat all of the sides. My wife had Huevos Ranchero. She was very pleased. My wife's dessert order was delivered incorrectly. The mistake could be equally blamed on my wife and the waitress.  Soon after we were seated other guests were seated at the neighboring tables. Those tables were less than a foot away. Even though they were talking quietly I could easily hear their conversations. The tables are uncomfortably close, especially for intimate conversation. The menu is extensive. Almost too many choices. I would go back at another time, eat less and take home more."
sherry t.,"San Jose, CA",19,295,8,3.0,4/14/2010,"Just like every other cheesecake factory out there.  Although the wait here isn't too bad. If you have never dined at cheesecake factory before, keep in mind that their portions are over the top huge and any ONE dish has over 2,000 calories easy!  Don't dine here if you are watching what you eat. My favorite of all time is the grilled shrimp and bacon! Worth every calorie!"
Jim S.,"Crystal Lake, IL",152,17,9,5.0,6/1/2012,Always a great place to eat and tons of selection! The menu is a BOOK! I got the South western egg rolls...A++++ For lunch i had the mac and cheese burger A++ as well. I luv Cheese Cake Factory!
John S.,"Aurora, IL",126,438,5,4.0,1/29/2010,Two words Giant Portions. Also they have a great Kobe Burger here and it isnt priced bad at all. You defiantly get what you are paying for here. The food is always great here and I always seem to get great service as well. The cheese Cake here is by far the best i have ever had as well. I always end up having to take my cheese cake home however because the portion sizes on the main course is so large. The piece of cheese cake they give you is enough for at least two meals as well. Looking forward to going back and getting another piece of the great godiva cheese cake :)
Don M.,"Mokena, IL",382,460,23,4.0,6/3/2011,"Gotta love some Cheesecake. Stopped in for lunch and arrived just in time before the crowd. Was seated right away and service started perfect. I ordered the Cobb salad and was recommend the lunch plate was plenty. She was not lying it was huge and delicious. i usually snarf up all my food but I did have a taste for Cheesecake. I spotted the combo of carrot cake and Cheesecake and had to have it. It was very good but heavy and filling. Nap time but well worth it. I did have a taste of my friends original and it was out of this world. Yum. I need to go back, bye."
Sasha D.,"Berwyn, IL",10,38,1,5.0,9/18/2012,"Still love the Cheesecake Factory, pasta dish's, tamale cakes, mojito! Still fun and the chessecake is always great if you ever have enough space in your belly to get to it lol. I always end up with leftovers and cheesecake to go."
Steven M.,"Mokena, IL",1162,1210,14,4.0,5/23/2011,"So I had reservations at Mon Ami across the lot and they pissed me off once again so came here. We were seated right away and the server was on top of her game. I ordered the cuban sandwich and it came on toasted french bread? When did the French invade Cuba? And the pork tasted more like beef. But who cares? This isn't called the Cuban Factory! For the last two months I have been searching for a great cheesecake. Usually I satisfy my cravings and move on. But no matter how many I ate, it just wouldn't go away! Wow! I had the original with huge plops of fresh whip cream. Awsome! Now my problem is I want it every day!"
Natalie W.,"Chicago, IL",4,43,1,3.0,11/18/2011,"This was my first time eating at the Cheesecake Factory.  I'm from the East coast and live in Chicago, but I ended up at this location after a day of shopping.  Its HUGE! Are they all this big?  We were there on a Saturday night without a reservation, and were still seated within an hour which, considering how packed it was, I consider a plus.  We ordered the buffalo wings as an appetizer and I had a glass of Riesling.  It was actually really good for being a 7ish dollar glass of wine.  The buffalo wings were good even though I don't really like buffalo wings.  For our main courses I had the Steak Diane and my date had the memphis burger.  My steak was really good - not too tough despite being cooked medium (sacreligious, i know, but i don't like uncooked meat) and the sauce had a really good flavor to it with the carmelized onions.  I didn't have any of my friend's burger, but it was huge and he couldn't finish it.   Our waitress was ok.  She brought our main courses like a minute and a half after she brought the buffalo wings, which isn't her fault at all, I just don't like when restaurants do this.  She didn't know if they had a Bordeaux which, with a menu as huge as the one here, is fine.  She brought me the wine list and I ordered, but didn't bring over the wine until I was mostly done with my steak.  We ordered cheesecake, and it was nice that we didn't feel rushed even though they were obviously packed.  I guess they're used to it.   It was a nice experience, but ultra touristy.  It was fun having a whole meal leftover to take home though, because the portions are enormous."
Aftab Q.,"Chicago, IL",23,40,1,5.0,12/1/2012,"Good service, excellent dessert. Try the dulce de leche cheesecake, you won't be sorry!!"
Foster R.,"Chicago, IL",10,67,9,5.0,5/24/2011,"I give cheesecake factory five stars. They have great service and the food is good. The chicken marcel blanc is very good. I couldn't wait to yelp about the red velvet cheesecake, wow! That is some good ass cheesecake, I've tried others, but the red velvet is the best one I've tasted so far. I love the dark colored bread with the oats on top, and the broccoli soup. I have never been dissatisfied with the cheesecake factory."
