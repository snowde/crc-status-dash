Nicole N.,"Villa Park, IL",0,6,,1.0,12/10/2017,"HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! my waiter was very sassy and rude (rolled her eyes at me) also very slow and unorganized, we waited for our bread for 30 min. not my first time here but this time i was very unpleased. don't make the same mistake i did of coming here."
Sofia L.,"Norridge, IL",0,48,1,1.0,9/17/2017,Went here for lunch today - what a HUGE disappointment Ordered chicken avocado club with a salad as a side Sandwich was ok - avocado a bit too ripe and bacon a little burnt - in addition chicken was at a minimal compared to other times  But the biggest disappointment....... AWFUL WILTED SOGGY SALAD  Honestly felt like I was eating someone's leftovers or salad that was a week old! After 2 bites my companion and I opted to let the waiter know / he offered a new salad ( NO THANKS) or fries ( which I don't eat) We declined - I later asked if he let manager know he said he did - but then when manager came over to our table he was a bit dumbfounded - at which point our plates were cleared. He offered a free dessert - we split one This salad should NEVER have been used PERIOD! I would hope that someone in the kitchen is monitoring what is being served before it gets played. The salad leaves were slimey and non-edible - hoping we won't get sick  NOT going back anytime soon -  Very disappointing!
Carl G.,"Naperville, IL",176,18,15,3.0,11/26/2016,"The service was average. Our food came quick, and our waters were filled regularly. Our conversations were being interrupted suddenly by the waitress just to see if everything was fine.  The food itself was average as well. The calamari is a nice appetizer that is crispy and tender. There's also a horseradish sauce on the side that complements the dish amazingly. My entree was the mushroom burger and it was mediocre at best. The flavor was in line with a microwaveable burger for some reason. The meat didn't have any flavor to it, and the burger was just topped with mushrooms and onions. The mixture was surprisingly bland and heavy unfortunately. The Fontina cheese didn't really do anything for the burger because it's quite mild. Definitely not what I expected. I ordered the Kahlua cheesecake, which is has flavors similar to Tiramisu, however, the Tiramisu cheesecake here is far too sweet. The Kahlua is just the right amount of sweet, and creaminess in a dessert. It's light for a cheesecake, and has an accent of coffee to contrast the cake's richness. If you like Tiramisu or other coffee related cakes, give the Kahlua a shot! It's called the Cheesecake Factory, so the cheesecake was great as expected. The other aspects of the meal were a little bit lacking."
Michelle M.,"Chicago, IL",0,13,1,1.0,10/5/2017,"I appreciate the feedback from the Cheesecake Factory.   I would like to advise you that every time I am there I DO let the manager know !  One day the floor in the washroom was so wet my young child fell and bumped her chin on the nasty wet washroom floor.  I walked up to the manager with her and we both told him what happened and all he said was he's have an employee take a look at it. Not at all sympathetic  To be completely honest with you, he blew it off  I was really disappointed.  I love the cheesecake and when the food is on point it's delicious !  But the washrooms and the smoking RIGHT outside the door to walk in are huge turnoffs.  If we're going to wait for over an hour for a table, things need to improve !   I can promise you from the bottom of my heart that the management has been notified several times regarding the washrooms being filthy. Next time I go I will get a few pics and post them to help you out.  I understand when management is going into an establishment, everyone scrambled to make things  look perfect.  Go there unannounced on a weekend night and you'll be in shock"
Molly S.,"Orland Park, IL",0,8,6,5.0,12/5/2017,"We went to dinner with our 2yr old and we couldn't have been happier with our experience. We were greeting promptly and received a table next to the bathroom. This was apreciated as I did not have to travel far to change a diaper. Sheila was our server and she was amazing! Our order was quick, accurate and absolutely delicious. She made several trips to our table and even made sure to stop when our daughter called to her. Our  daughter delighted in telling Shelia about the man who was smoking outside who disappeared (she told this several times). Our visit was pleasant and very satisfying. We will return and hopefully get the privledge of sitting in Shelia's section."
Nicki S.,"Lombard, IL",67,179,111,5.0,3/31/2017,"I really loved my experience here with my family. Our server Paula was very attentive and humored my kids (with very short attention spans). We were worried about taking little kids out to a restaurant. Paula went above and beyond for us and made sure we were happy. My 3 year old decided to formally introduce himself and everyone at the table to her -- which was hilarious-- and she remembered his name and kept checking up on us. She even paid attention to the reason we were celebrating -- my husbands birthday -- and she said happy birthday to him (first name basis thanks to my son), brought us a lovely cheesecake which was decorated with sprinkles and chocolate writing. And she got a few other waiters to sing with her. We didn't have to ask. She is a doll. I hope management reads this because she deserves a pat on the back.     As far as food, I feel like we got great sized portions. Lunch size portions are available for certain dishes. My husband had a burrito. I know, burritos at the Cheesecake Factory? Easily one of the largest burritos I've seen at a ""chain"" restaurant! He said it was amazing. Kids menu is available and had lots of options. Of course, our Cheesecake was amazing too! No complaints. Great service. Thank you!"
Charlotte B.,"Portage, MI",7,7,,4.0,9/18/2017,"Had a crispy pineapple chicken with a pineapple mojito, both super tasty. Biggest decision was trying to figure out what to eat! Marcellus was a great waiter! Wish I lived here! Very tasty food"
Carolyn K.,"Villa Park, IL",4,10,1,1.0,1/9/2017,"I would to love to say this place was great, but i cant. We went there on a sunday at 3pm for a early dinner for my mother in laws birthday. However to my surprise they do not take reservations on weekends, not even for large parties of 14 like ours was. We were told an hour and a half wait and that was ridiculous. So we called Seasons 52 and they were able to accomodate us immediately. Now im going to go write a fabulous  review for them Update....just received a response. Although i appreciate it. They did nothing to accomodate or possibly alleviate the issue in the future....i am not going to go for a bday DINNER at 10 am when you open"
Jacob H.,"Villa Park, IL",101,9,,5.0,9/18/2017,We had a great experience here today. Marco was our server and he got us everything that we wanted very quickly. We ate the bread right away and we asked for only brown bread for the second basket. He instantly brought us three loaves of the bread. Marco was very nice and attentive and the food was fantastic. We will be returning!
Raina K.,"Homewood, IL",2,22,71,3.0,8/2/2016,"If you've ever watched shows like ""Restaurant Impossible"", you've probably heard that restaurants that try to have a hundred different items on their menu generally don't have the best quality food. I would say this is completely true about the Cheesecake Factory. There are so many items on the menu that it's near impossible to decide, but the food is nothing spectacular. They also tend to be super busy, meaning the service is subpar.  I ordered the Louisiana Chicken Pasta, as it's usually raved about online. The chicken was super moist on the inside, and crispy on the outside. The pasta, however, was oily and the saucy didn't have any spice to it. There were also 5 slices of mushroom and two or three pepper chunks, which hardly qualifies as present in the dish. The serving was huge, and probably could have fed 3 people.  I also ordered the Kahlua cheesecake, which was amazing. I wasn't a fan of the brownie layer, but the coffee cheesecake and chocolate mousse were amazing.  Overall, you're paying high prices for average quality food and slow service. I would go for the cheesecake, but eat dinner somewhere else."
Charlotte L.,"Orland Park, IL",0,7,9,5.0,5/19/2017,"Except for a few hiccups with  the dishes everything was great. The food was delicious. I had the French toast brioche, Napoleon Style. I also had egg white omelet with mushrooms and spinach that was delicious except for the bacon that I didn't ask for and the cheese that I didn't get that I did ask for. Yes, I will go back. This visit was on Mothers Day and they were pretty busy."
Alexander L.,"Batavia, IL",0,3,,1.0,7/22/2017,"Extremely disappointed with my most recent visit. This visit was on Saturday 07/22/2017 from 5:45PM to 8:45PM. I have been dining at The Cheesecake Factory for a little over a year now. Me and my girlfriend have made it a staple visit at least once a month for the last 9 months. With that being said, my most recent visit has almost entirely ruined this destination. After our arrival, we were advised that our wait time would be ""no more than twenty minutes."" At least thats what the hostess said. Forty-five minutes later, and after having to watch multiple people who arrived after us be seated before us, we were finally seated. Our waiter seemed to prefer talking with his coworkers more than helping us, it took him approximately 15 minutes to bring us our DRINK ORDER. At first i just thought he was extremely busy, until we spotted him behind their staff station, very clearly laughing and messing around with the other waiters/ waitresses for about 5 minutes straight. Not only that, but when i tried to lighten the mood with a joke as we were ordering, stating that i was skipping liquor for the night, to be the DD; our waiter said to me, and i quote: ""Ive been stuck in that situation before buddy, but even when im the DD, I drink more than everyone else!""...... My date and I did not find this funny, as we both know someone who was killed by a drunk driver. Onto the food. I ordered a Cuban Sandwich with fries, and my girlfriend ordered the Fehttuchini Alfredo with chicken. My sandwich arrived cold, and not toasted. Her pasta arrived in a much smaller quantity than it usually does. After trying a few bites of both, we both agreed that the quality of our food had severely declined. We decided it was time to leave, asked for the check, and waited another 20 minutes for him to bring it to us. The total for our meals came out to $48.56, and after a tip, $56.56. However, I still wanted desert, so i let my girlfriend run to the car while I grabbed a spot in line, 15 minutes later, my order was taken. One slice of Lemoncello Torte. I kid you not, i waited 25 minutes for one slice of overpriced cake. (a little over $9.50 i believe). I am writing this review with great disappointment, as I gave this establishment a four star review last month. As of right now, i do not see myself continuing my tradition. Over $60 of my hard earned money, essentially down the drain. Very sad. I hope to hear from customer service, i have receipts to prove this night took place. VERY UPSET."
Frank H.,"Oswego, IL",4,9,2,1.0,7/27/2017,"My dad left hungry and unhappy. He ordered a medium rare steak, simple right? Well 45 minutes later when the rest of the family is done, he gets a well done steak.. but not literally well done, more like beef jerky. Alright, Alright. Oh wait forgot to tell you it was his bday! So we bring the manager over here and she says uh oh I'll get you a knew one. And I say "" this doesn't look pink to me"" then another hour later, another good piece of well done steak. I say "" cmon, this is as gray as my wives dress!"" Keep in mind that a well done steak is the easiet to make. Never going here again. Hopefully they see this"
Julia R.,"Channahon, IL",119,6,1,5.0,9/9/2017,"the waiter and service here were incredible. It was my first time ever coming here & the menu is pretty big so my family and I took quiet a long time deciding on what we were gonna eat, not once did she ever rush us. We got out food fairly quickly with how busy there were at the time & everything was magnificent!! Very huge portions size & free bread! It was my birthday this day and they went out of there way of singing and writing a adorable happy birthday message on my delicious carrot cake. I Will 60000% recommend to try this place to anyone who hasnt."
Dan D.,"Evergreen Park, IL",4,131,28,5.0,2/9/2017,"I've said it once and I'll say it again, this place is awesome. I love the huge menu, so many choices can be overwhelming but it works at this place. We usually go to the Orland location, but things are just as good here. The server was on top of things and food was great as always. We had red velvet cheesecake like always and it was fantastic. I would highly recommend this place to anybody looking for a date night or just a nice place to go out and eat."
Isabel K.,"Chicago, IL",67,90,283,4.0,2/8/2017,"i've come here multiple times in the last 10 years and not once have i had a problem here! they do get quite busy, so i would get reservations beforehand. but if you're grabbing just dessert, you can grab one of the high top tables by the bar! the list of cheesecakes i've had...oh man. and the bread too! oh man. delicious! +1 for the staff!"
Thania V.,"Chicago, IL",0,3,3,1.0,5/2/2017,I had horrible customer service with one of their female employees  She didn't know how to move with intention to assist multiple tables. She seemed to assist other tables better. The guy that assist us after did a great job but seemed bother.  Also my brother chicken strips had a piece of fried calamari. Needless to say he did eat it after that. Wouldn't go again.
Annie C.,"West Chicago, IL",43,2,1,5.0,9/3/2017,I went to the Cheesecake Factory with our Church's Usher Ministry.  The service was excellent and the food was delicious.  It was my first time there and I look forward to returning.  I highly recommend the Cheesecake Factory.  It is a great place to dine or celebrate a special occasion.
Heather E.,"Berkeley, IL",9,14,1,5.0,8/12/2017,I love this restaurant. One of my favorite places to eat. The menu is very long and many options. Always order cheesecake to go!
Erin V.,"Superior, CO",0,124,69,4.0,9/12/2016,"We love this place. The food is always delicious.  When I was there for lunch on Saturday with my husband, we both loved our meal.  I tried Coconut Curry Mahi Mahi.  It was fabulous.  He did a cheeseburger and loved it, however the fries were subpar.   I also had a frozen drink called the Georgia Peach which has a swirl of raspberry in it. Yummy! My only complaint is how pushy the servers are about dessert.  Makes dieting even harder! Overall, great chain and great location.  Four stars!"
