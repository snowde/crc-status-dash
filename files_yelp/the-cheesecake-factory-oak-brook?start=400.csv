Arthur G.,"Oak Lawn, IL",28,10,1,5.0,8/7/2012,"This place is great looking. Interior is nice, has a classy touch to it, and the service was wonderful. They have a really large selection of items from small appetizers to large entrees and of course their numerous selections of cheesecake. I went on Valentines Day and the services was surprisingly on par. My tip is that if you're planning to go on VDay, be warned that they don't take reservations and the wait is an hour plus. Try out their steak and salmon combo. It's really good. Plus they give you a big load of mashed potatoes. I recommend this place for either do casual dining or taking someone here for a date."
-Jwa C.,"Chicago, IL",1,4,1,3.0,11/3/2010,"My family ate at this place for the first time last week, the service was very good.  We didn't even have to wait that long to be seated , athough the place was crowded.  After we were seated, our waiter came over and took our orders. I ordered the ""Evelyn's Favorite Pasta"", My husband ordered ""Fettuccini Alfredo"" with chicken, and my daughter ordered a ""Charbroiled Flat Iron Steak"", shortly after, our waiter brought our food.   I was highly disappointed when our food arrived  'cause as long as I've been eating at The Cheesecake Factory all around, I have never gotten such small portions.  Don't get me wrong it was enough, but the amount of food they brought  us was normally the amount that we were use to   taking home from any of the other Cheesecake Factories that we've eaten in in the past (Skokie, Schaumburg, and Downtown Chicago mainly), my daughter steak was about 1/2 the size of what we were use to getting.   However, the establishment  appeared to be nice and clean, and the staff were friendly & nice.   I like the Cheesecake Factory in Downtown Chicago the best of all!"
Arlene G.,"Oak Park, IL",93,905,,4.0,11/30/2009,"Ate here with my bro and mommy so we could use his gift certificate. We ordered 3 appetizers and shared them all. The nachos were ok, but nothing too special. It needed more salsa dispersed around the chips. The mini burgers were good, but the buns were bigger than the actual patty. I didn't like that even though the burgers were tasty. Last but certainly not least, was the lettuce wraps. This was my fave! The peanut buttery sauce was awesome! It's like the dip you use for chicken satay in Thai restaurants. YUMMY!"
Cory K.,"Crown Point, IN",4,25,19,4.0,4/4/2012,Extensive menu. We enjoy this restaurant a lot.
Taeler H.,"Chicago, IL",135,229,140,5.0,12/28/2011,"I really like this place. The decor ks trendy and nice, I consider it to be like an upscale casual eatery that specializes In cheesecake. It's a little expensive but it's all worth it. I've never had anything from here that I didn't like. My only complaints are the slippery floors and not having the option to do half size entrees at dinner time. Their appetizers are big enough to be a meal for one, and their dinner entrees are so big you'll either have leftovers or be so full you won't need breakfast the next day."
Zach T.,"Lisle, IL",103,419,,3.0,1/27/2009,"The menu is a huge confusing heap, as with all the links in this chain.  The decor made me feel like I Was in Vegas or Myrtle beach... The food is BLAND CITY.  When you do stir fry, Pizza, burgers, and mexican, you can only aspire to a TGIFridays level of aptitude, and that's where this place is. Knowing this, we went down for mini burgers, Pizza, and a Chop Salad.  They were all fine.  That's right.  Fine. Service was great.  The drinks were GREAT.  I had the Gin Rickey and it really hit the spot. This place gets as good a review as it does, because they gave my wife and I and our 2 small children a HUGE circular booth.  That made things a lot easier on us.   The cheesecake is likewise excellent.  If I were you, I'd eat elsewhere and have dessert here."
Liz W.,"Chicago, IL",54,259,52,4.0,5/2/2011,"I tend to stay away from chain restaurants because I'd rather eat at a local restaurant instead of a place that infuses their food with sodium. I did make an exception since I love cheesecake factory and the bf has never ate here. Of course the wait was about 30 min on a Sunday evening. At first they sat us in this tiny cramped area, but they saw that my bf was on crutches they offered us a booth right away. Score!! I ordered the lemon baked chicken with mashed potatoes and oh my. That chicken was so tender and flavorful. I was so full I only ate half. Of course all their cheesecake is delish, but I didn't want to gain 5 lbs."
Dan P.,"La Grange Park, IL",14,58,23,3.0,3/27/2012,"Food is always good, as well as the atmosphere.  Only negatives I have for the place is the service and the lack of reservation system or call-ahead service.  I'm not being picky, with at least a reservation service, it will cut down on the wait times for customers (a lot of people leave after hearing the wait time, the maximum I've heard was 2 1/2 hours).  And the 2nd note, when you have A LOT of waiters/waitresses, you'd expect better faster service than your typical restaurant, but no.  As I said, I love the food, drinks, and especially the cheesecake here, just wanted to give a honest review."
Jean K.,"Lombard, IL",141,175,6,3.0,10/26/2009,"Huge menus, decent food and high prices. I'd return for the cheesecake but not much of anything else"
Diane K.,"Bartlett, IL",0,18,,4.0,4/24/2014,"Long wait to get in for dinner on Saturday nights (even if you get there early), very crowded waiting area. Service was good, food was excellent, miso salmon was delicious! My friend loved her herb crusted salmon and loves their cheesecake."
Katie W.,"Lancaster, PA",28,92,1,3.0,10/9/2009,"The Cheesecake Factory should be noted for it's HUGE menu, GIANT portions, MASS appeal. But note, what do each of these three adjectives have in common? They are all synonyms for BIG or FAT.  What really gets me about the Cheesecake Factory is that after countless appeals and the fact that most other national chain restaurants provide nutritional information (some would like it to be required by law), The Cheesecake Factory refuses to do so. Most speculate they do not because their percentage of fat and calories are absurdly high and people would start feeling guilty about dining here. But, I wish they could still be honest about the food that they serve.  With that out in the air, my experience with service at the Oak Brook location has been okay. But on my last visit, I was going for a quick dinner at the bar, where they serve ""light' portions of meals at awesome prices. I love their Thai Wraps, and wanted to get the happy hour priced portion (for like $4.00 you can't resist!). Upon arriving, I mentioned I was here for happy hour and the hostess told me to pick a seat in the bar area.  It took nearly 10 minutes for a waiter to even come to our high top table to ask us what we wanted to drink. (the bar tender meanwhile was behind the bar 2 feet away from us reading the paper!). We ordered our food. I pointed at the bar menu listing of the smaller portion discounted Thai Wraps when I ordered.  It takes quite awhile for even our glasses of wine comes. The waiters excuse was ""oh sorry, I was in the back chatting with the manager"". um okay?  When we got our order, my Thai Wraps were HUGE, definitely not the small happy hour protion. I noted this, and the waiter said ""yes, they're always that big"". So, I gave him the benefit of  the doubt. This was the first time I had ordered them at the Oak Brook location.  But low and behold, once we got our bill I was charged the full price. We I asked the waiter, he said that he was sorry. that's it. I asked if we could be charged the Happy Hour price and he said ""I guess I could ask the manager, but you already ate it"".  UGH, because I already questioned HIM about it! Why else would we sit in the bar, say we were there for happy hour, order off the happy hour menu, and then ask why it was so big when it came? Okay, but that was just one experience. Other times, service has been okay, but something still irks me about Cheesecake Factory."
Tim R.,"Woodridge, IL",58,9,,2.0,12/30/2010,"I'm not too sure why this place gets such rave reviews.  I've been dragged to this place a few times and every time it is the same thing - wait forever to sit down, wait forever to see a waiter, wait forever for drinks, etc (you get the point).  The menu seems like a cobbled together collection of old menus and confusing advertisements.  You'll encounter a page of appetizers, next page 'specialties', next page burgers, another page of appetizers (huh?), sandwiches, then pasta...  What's going on here? Now for the anecdote - Yesterday, my coworker picked this location for our end of year luncheon.  We had a larger party (9) so I expected to wait.  But we arrived at 11:30 to a newly opened, mostly empty restaurant and we still waited 20 minutes to sit down.  Once we finally saw a waiter and finally received our drinks, I noticed my glass had a huge 'how can you not notice that?' crack in it.  The glass was promptly replaced but it still stunk of the staff not really caring about their product or presentation.  Then, after placing our appetizer and food order we had 3 different dudes come to our table to assure us our food was on the way (how about one of ya's go make it?).  We finally got the appetizers and the fried macaroni and cheese balls were, as always, the hit of the meal.  I repeat, the appetizer was the best part of the meal.  I had the blue cheese BLT burger.  It was a tasty burger and cooked to my order so that was good.  I ordered a side salad opposed to fries and the lettuce/weeds in the salad were so soggy it was unedible.  We didn't have dessert but I've had the cheesecake here before and they have a lot of options and it has always been very good. My advice - go across the parking lot to Mon Ami Gabi or Reel Club for dinner or lunch and stop by this place for espresso and dessert."
Tina E.,"North Aurora, IL",13,222,223,5.0,6/18/2011,"By far, my fav ""chain"" restaurant. I've vowed to make my through the menu even though they keep adding new items. Many new items on the small plates menu like the crispy crab bites & chicken samosas. Tried the Mahi Mahi as main course & it was outstanding. Cheesecake of the moment is Mango Key lime-tart and refreshing in the summer!  My server Vanessa in the bakery was perfect at putting my order together & getting my on my way. Easy parking in the lot or by valet. Wish they were closer!"
N O.,"Naperville, IL",0,12,,3.0,2/3/2014,"Lunchtime meal was excellent; dessert was phenomenal. BUT the service was just ok, and the music way too loud."
Darius D.,"Willowbrook, IL",10,22,,3.0,11/6/2011,"The setting of this restaurant is quite nice and warm. The selection of the food is quite extensive, but it is on the pricy side. The portions are quite big as well, so you get what you pay for. The main attraction, of course is the cheesecake! This place is great for a date and to have some amazing cake. There is only a few other places that offer such a great selection of cheesecakes, so if you like to sample, try em' all!"
Tavo N.,"Hillside, IL",1,6,,4.0,2/20/2011,Great restaurant overall...i had drinks at the bar and food...service was vreat and food was brought out quickly and waitress was very nive always making sure we were ok
Jeremie M.,"Englewood, CO",24,16,2,4.0,6/9/2014,"very good food, but don't go if you are in a hurry, place is really busy and you will be there at least an hour. servers are super nice and the portions are really generous."
Jason U.,"Chicago, IL",12,25,8,4.0,12/3/2011,"Great service. Always awesome food. No complaints, clean washrooms and helpful waiters. Pleasure to eat there with family and friends."
Eric F.,"Dallas, TX",46,42,19,3.0,6/26/2011,Cheesecake Factory is pretty standard. Average service with mediocre food. The cheesecake itself is great but not cheap.
janice m.,"Chicago, IL",13,134,,3.0,8/16/2012,"Dinner here on a Sunday night with a large group can get sticky, however, we were pleasantly surprised when we only had to wait for 15 minutes. After being seated we ordered drinks and dinner. Although busy, our wait times were again about 15minutes, which I consider good. The S.O. had a burger, it was slightly overcooked and the bun was mundane, but he said it was ok. I had the corn tamale cakes, which I think hands down are the best thing on their menu. They were just as I remembered, tasty, just the right portion for dinner, and hot, but not too spicy.  When it was time for coffee and dessert, S.O. ordered a raspberry white chocolate cheesecake. He loved that. Now for the bad parts...he ordered a drink, it came in a cracked, chipped glass. While they replaced it, they didn't offer to take it off the tab. Sorry, I work in the business and I know the first rule...broken chipped glass...free drink! I was drinking ice tea during dinner, one glass mind you. As it was kind of cold I wanted hot tea. Yup, you guessed it, they charged me again...so sad for a large chain to gouge a customer. 3.00 for a cup of Lipton Tea...again so sad. Our bill was 60.00 for 2 teas, a drink, 2 dinners (one was an appetizer and one a burger) and a piece of cheesecake. A little steep as far as I was concerned, as we have eaten at  The Clubhouse around the corner for not much more and much better food."
