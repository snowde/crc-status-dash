Tony C.,"IL, IL",338,118,1,1.0,5/2/2011,Went their couple weeks ago and the service was really bad first off they didn't buzz us on the pager and so I went to the hostess and she said oh we buzzed you 15 mins ago when i had the page in my hand the whole time. She should of called us or told us the table was ready since we were sitting almost in front of her waiting. Then when we were seated they gave us a table for 4 not 2 when we only had 2 people. Then when I asked for a booth they said 15 mins then we can get you one and you have to go to the front of the resturant then we will call you. It really shows they don't care they just want people in and out like a fast food place.
Thomas G.,"Orland Park, IL",6,8,7,5.0,4/14/2012,This restaurant is purely amazing! I tried a few of the dishes and I always have trouble deciding which one to eat. A++++
Brent W.,"Chicago, IL",96,953,834,3.0,6/2/2008,"Another place trying to do too much and ends up doing nothing ""really well"" (save for one menu item which i'll get to below).  The spiral bound, laminated menu reads like a novel, even with *out* all the color adverts on every other page, wtf?  I'm pretty sure i've only eaten at a Cheesecake Factory about three times total.  And no, i'm not gonna dog the place b/c it's a chain, that would be predictable and silly.  I will call the place out b/c it's not all that great, however.   The highlight of the meal was straight off the jump, which was the appetizer: chicken potstickers.  WOW! Absolutely sensational!!! (and the only reason this place gets an extra star).  I was so in love w these delectable little dumplings, I almost threw my Cuban sammy out and ordered another for my main.   As noted, I went w the Cuban which was on the reco of our server; it was b/t that or the turkey club.  It was decidedly mediocre and came w a ton of ham and pork, both of which were ok, a decent sear but the pork was a little fatty.  The bread was the main let-down, it had a croissant like and flimsy texture and did a poor job imitating an authentic crusty breaded Cuban.  The accompanying fries were a basic fry w.out any seasoning whatsoever, but I was starving and ate almost all of them.   The wife went the fish & chips and the breading was thick and hard...great if you're a women involved in intercourse, not so much when describing the textured breading of a decent fish & chip.  My sister had the Santa Fe Salad, which was huge and probably the best of all our meals.  And speaking of, i'll give this place credit for consistency, every thing from the menu to the portion sizes to the space itself: All over-the-top big (too much so, imo). As mentioned in v recent review of Bacci's pizza slices, bigger is not always better and Cheesecake Factory is another good example."
Lewis W.,"Darien, IL",0,16,,5.0,1/5/2012,I've been here many many times. This is one of my favorite places. The place is gorgeous. Plenty of room and the outside dining is very comfortable.  The staff is very accommodating. They go all out to make your dining experience enjoyable. My favorite: Fettucini Alfredo. I've tried many of the dinners and desserts and everything was excellent. Highly recommend the Chicken Marsala.  I can' t say enough about this place
Joe N.,"Lansing, MI",4,56,6,4.0,8/13/2011,"Never being to The Cheesecake Factory before, I was not sure what to expect in terms if a menu besides lots of cheesecake selections.  I was surprised that the place was very large and so was the menu. They have almost too large of a selection. I went with the lunch sized portion Cabornara. It was good and everyone I was with enjoyed their meals as well. I was surprised though that they wanted to up-charge me $7 to add shrimp on a lunch sized portion so I elected to have the chicken.  I guess the regular portion sizes are very large so if u do not want leftovers or to be stuffed, I would recommend the lunch size portions when applicable."
Bill B.,"El Cerrito, CA",305,886,287,3.0,8/29/2008,"Enormous, and moderately loud, this still turned out to be a decent place for dinner. We were quoted a 45 minute wait for a group of 5 on a Saturday evening, but were seated in about 25 minutes. Service was pretty good, and the tasty food had very large portions (2-3 servings). The menu was very extensive, though oddly arranged in order by price rather than type of food. I was rather surprised by finding 2 full pages of just cheesecake options for dessert (and not just different toppings), although perhaps I shouldn't have been. At least tonight, folks seemed mostly dressed to impress! TRIVIA: Rumor has it that Cheesecake Factory installs cell phone blockers to eliminate the annoyance of overhearing somebody's phone conversation. My reception was terrible, so maybe it's true. If so, I'm a big supporter of the policy!"
RoGina W.,"Chicago, IL",22,32,,5.0,8/9/2012,"We decided to come to the Cheesecake Factory after my graduation  on a Sunday. There were 6 adults  and 2 toddlers in our party. We called in advance and was told that they do not take weekend reservations.  We asked to be put on the waiting list over the phone and again was told no. When we arrived 20 minutes after our call, and had to wait an additional 45 mins  to be seated.   The portions were huge like always. The server got one order wrong, but it was ok because it was actually better tasting than what we originally  ordered.  My toddler ordered the pizza from the lunch menu and when the waitress asked if he like he, he promptly told her ""No, I don't want it""  After explaining what type of pizza he likes, the promptly took the one he didn't like off the bill and brought out complimentary fries and fruit for him.  This was great service., but because of the wait, I'll have to think long and hard before going back."
Jennifer C.,"Maple Grove, MN",208,483,44,4.0,2/24/2011,"Went in with my hubby for the happy hour food specials yesterday.  We got the Chicken sliders for $5 which were delicious.  The white bean hummus for $4.95 which was also great.  My hubby got a diet coke, I just had water.  We had the white chocolate caramel macadamia nut cheesecake (which we had a free card for since we bought some gift cards for Christmas) which was so so good.  Our total was $13.90, so we only ended up paying $18 after tip and everything which was awesome!!!"
Dino D.,"Westmont, IL",70,84,42,4.0,3/13/2011,"Ya gotta love this place really!!!  Even thou it's always crowded, and that's not just because the Martinis are cold & the cheesecake is prefect. The food is outstanding too.  !! Buffalo Blasts !! These are great cause if you like the Buffalo Wings & are not too fond of the sauce all over the outside (still really good that way) check these out.... shredded and seasoned chicken with just the right amount of hot sauce, stuffed into a wonton & I should say large wonton dough.... then deep fried to a tasty golden crispy perfection. Put into a plate with Blue Cheese & more Hot sauce dips and a few sticks of celery. It not considered a complete lunch or dinner plate but it sure could pass for one. PLENTY of them for even a table of 4.  I lunched on a plate of Garlic Buttered Noodles with Shrimp, shitaki shrooms & asparagus so much delicious stuff on the plate I had plenty to take home for lunch tomorrow. Cheesecake slice to go please!"
Shannon H.,"Roscoe Village, Chicago, IL",134,148,93,2.0,2/9/2011,If you're looking for a place that will impress you with its ambience and you aren't worried about money then the Cheesecake Factory is for you. Otherwise the food is meh and pretty pricy. The Cheesecake is good though and the ambience is pretty cool.
Jaclyn S.,"Chicago, IL",2,16,,1.0,11/5/2010,"All I have to say is: YUCK. First of all, it's well-documented that this is one of the WORST places to eat if you're conscious of your health and caloric intake. Good luck trying to find something on the menu that isn't a total gut-buster--even the salads and seafood entrees are loaded with hidden calories and fat. As if that wasn't bad enough, the last time I went to the Oak Brook location I had a mildly horrifying experience. I sat down to a table, glanced down at my utensils... and noticed that my fork had a USED BAND-AID stuck to it!! I couldn't possibly make this up - it was so bizarre and disgusting - and I have witnesses! When the waitress came over, I showed it to her... she was apologetic (of course) but at that point, there was nothing they could do to save the dining experience. I left without ordering and never returned!! I can't understand why there are always lines of people waiting to get into this place... the food is terrible for you and generally repulsive, the service is hit or miss, the host staff is rude, and apparently they don't care very much for cleanliness (or they wouldn't allow band-aids to be left on forks.) America, get a clue! The Cheesecake Factory is nothing but a bad habit."
Nicole P.,"Chicago, IL",32,66,2,5.0,10/13/2012,"I had a gift card for this place, so my boyfriend and I went on a date night.  The location is great if you love shopping and getting some yummy food after.  That's exactly what we did that day.  I tried the skinny margarita with no salt on the rim....definitely a must try!  My boyfriend had just a top shelf margarita, which he also loved.  I had every intention of blowing my diet that night, so I went in saying I will eat anything that looks good.  I love me some pasta, so I was excited when I saw the HUGE selection of pastas they offered!  I tried the jambalaya pasta, which was oh so spicy and oh so amazing!  It had shrimp, chicken, and lots of peppers.  The portion was enough for my dinner and lunch the next day!  YES!!  My boyfriend ordered with fish tacos, which were just as fantastic.  When it came to dessert, we had the hardest time deciding what cheesecake to order.  We decided on the turtle, which came to the table already sliced in half for us!  How thoughtful, especially since I usually hog all of the dessert!  Maybe our server could sense my overwhelming love for sweets.  Which brings me to our server.  He was awesome, and kind of reminded me of one of my friends from back home.  Overall, a wonderful experience and worth eating there again!"
Mike B.,"Southlake, TX",72,286,1,4.0,5/2/2008,"Now I'm not big on chains, but this location was a stone's throw from my room at the Renaissance across the way. Walked in at 10:20 pm on a Friday night...more people on their way out than on the way in. Sat at the bar--immediately served by bartender who made a very nice Gin Rickey...a little steep at $8.50 but soothed my tired body and I was on an expense account. Went with the seared Ahi Tuna with Wasabi crust over rice oredered rare and was very happy with my selection.  I've been very dissapointed with Ahi Tuna in the past, but it was prepared perfectly.  Love that Wasabi/tuna flavor combination! Ended up shooting the breeze with the bartender and a fellow patron for quite some time. Tuna--$19.99 Bill total--$30 with tax I think I'll be back to try the spicy pecan chicken..."
Julie A.,"Chicago, IL",59,258,18,4.0,12/1/2010,"How can you not like the Cheesecake factory? Well unless you just could not make up your mind as to what to pick from the menus..or maybe your not a fan of leftovers, well either way I love it. I usually get takeout when I am to lazy to cook. The service from take ot and Waitresses has always been great. I like the Lemon Chicken dish, while my hubby is a fan of the Jambalya pasta dish. The Godiva cheese cake was so good..I actually ate the entire piece."
Julie Y.,"Burr Ridge, IL",0,6,,5.0,8/12/2011,"I've been to this location before.Yes, this location is always busy. Especially nearing the weekend! The service has always been up to par and the food portions generous. Everything we have tasted on the menu has been delicious. I'm writing this review today because we went to Cheesecake Factory last night for my dad's birthday. Our servers were absolutely phenomenal. They were quick, kind, and courteous with their service. My mom absolutely loves the wheat bread and they were both very swift in bringing out the refills. One of them even went out of his way to track down some olive oil for her. Overall, the meal was wonderful and I look forward to going back."
Tommaso S.,"Oak Park, IL",213,51,114,5.0,11/24/2010,"The lettuce wraps where presented with an indulgence of Thai sauces ,cucumbers, carrot sticks."
Rob C.,"Downers Grove, IL",0,4,,1.0,10/13/2014,"Went to Oakbrook location for dinner was seated with in 15 mins. which was great are server came got our drink order bread came later but was unable to get more bread it was never available.Than we placed our food order asked for honey mustard for chix sandwich along with extra ketchup, also asked for extra gravy for the lemon ckix. dinner. What we got we yellow mustard no ketchup and dry lemon chix. With a bowl of brown gravy not the cream sauce so our waiter never came back asked a different server for the honey mustard and ketchup than our waiter came and I explained I wanted the cream sauce extra of it she goes I will get it. 15 mins. later it came out ice cold now I ad mm ed for a manager how could this happen he apologized and had it brought out again after waiting it was barely warm, it was a bad experience the manager never came back to make sure everything was fine. We just got a box to take the food home so I could heat it up to proper food temp. I went on line to tell them about the service and unacceptable food quality. There way of fixing it was a 20.00 gift card lucky me now i have to go back and spend more money for bad food and service."
Jackie A.,"Mount Prospect, IL",16,269,14,4.0,9/23/2010,"I used to not like Cheesecake Factory because I used to get food that was too salty (meatloaf) or I just didn't like too much (shepherd's pie, . But after coming to this location I am a fan.  I love their chicken tortilla soup.  The Louisiana Chicken Pasta is really good but I usually get the salmon with pasta.  The red velvet and adams peanut butter cheesecakes are my favorite."
G A.,"Schaumburg, IL",34,8,,2.0,4/6/2013,"I have come here a few times for their happy hour specials. Their menu and food is amazing and the only reason I have come back. The service has been horrible each time. The first time a group of about 8 servers were just hanging out in the bar area playing on their phones. One server  was hugging all of the girls and the hosts were laughing so loud with each other we could hear them goofing around all the way on the other side of the restaurant. The manager walked by and did not say anything to the servers who were on their phones. With all of these servers there, we had to flag our server down just to get our order taken. The staff looks messy and has crazy hair. For a place that is not cheap, the staff is trashy.  The second time we went it was the same thing, except this time there was a chunk of food on my silverware. Then my beer glass had black specks of something in it. I asked for a new one that was okay. Then my second beer glass had the same. I have worked in the restaurant business for many years and have never seen such loose management. We could here the staff swearing to each other and using their phones during our whole mean.  I only will return because the specials are great, but it is a shame the staff is ruining this place. Especially in an economy like this. The management should all be replaced."
Sheena H.,"Brooklyn, NY",24,121,,4.0,8/21/2007,"Went to the Cheesecake Factory last night and overall I enjoyed my meal.  As others have said, the waiting time is horrible and even if they say 10-20 minutes, be prepared that to translate to 30-40 minutes.  Once you sit down and get going, the service is much better. Our waitress was a bit wooden and hardly came to check on us, but we received our food in a timely fashion.   As you know, the portions are huge so be ready to share!  I got the crispy chicken taquitos and my other friends just got desert.   Overall, I would say Cheesecake Factory is good if you are hungry, but willing to wait.  My food is always consistent and I never leave without a full tummy."
