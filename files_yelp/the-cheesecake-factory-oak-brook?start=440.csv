Mike M.,"Clarendon Hills, IL",25,43,1,4.0,7/7/2010,"Oscar and Evelyn Overton founded the Cheesecake Factory in the 1970s, and their vision of a complete bakery and restaurant has made this Oak Brook restaurant and others of its kind extremely popular.  There are over 150 locations nationwide. The Bakery cooks up delicious deserts including its world famous cheesecake in over 25  different flavors.  The restaurant contains a modern design with helpful service provided.  The menu is one of the most diverse, and includes nearly every genre of food, from pizzas and pastas to pan-asian dishes.    Finally, the full stocked bar offers delicious drinks and cocktails."
Misse D.,"Chicago, IL",377,591,3,4.0,7/10/2008,"I love Cheesecake Factory. This review is for this specific location, not the chain in general. It's pretty cool.  I still think the downtown Chicago location is the best that I've been to in terms of decor.  However, the Oak Brook locale has excellent outdoor seating that is a short walk from Neiman's.   The other great thing is that the max wait is 10 minutes.  You really can't beat that, can you?"
Joshua M.,"San Diego, CA",204,1480,170,3.0,6/2/2010,"I could probably write a master review on the Cheesecake Factory. Stick to the Orange Chicken.  The cheesecake is awesome.  Expect long waits.  If you are a party of 2 you're going to be sitting 6 inches away from strangers.  The food will be good, the service will be somewhat cheesy.  Your experience will usually be consistent with all of their other locations.  Yep there you have it."
Barbie S.,"Chicago, IL",21,70,,5.0,7/4/2008,"Ok, so I know it is a chain.... but I love the Cheesecake Factory. Granted it is not a formal dining experience, but for what it is I definitely think it deserves 5 stars!!! They have good martini's and they have the largest menu I have ever seen. You can have breakfast, sandwiches, pasta, Mexican, soup, tons of salads, so many appetizers..... however, I always order the same meal. It is one of my favorite all time meals. I LOVE LOVE LOVE their fish tacos!!! They are the best fish tacos I have ever had. And anywhere I go, I will eat fish tacos (unless the fish is fried and breaded)... but they grill the fish, and the tacos are so light.  OMG and I read some of these reviews.... small portions? WOW! I can only eat one taco - and there are 3 HUGE tacos.  I have had other items on the menu sampling my friends meals, and I have never had anything I didn't think was good. And of course their Cheesecakes....but I am not sure how anyone manages to eat a piece of cheesecake after the meal, I always just take it home.  This location is really big, and no matter how crowded it is, it never feels crowded, and the bar is  huge, so plenty of room while you wait. * AS A SIDE NOTE *  I do not like the Woodfield location - I have experienced a few episodes with the rude waiters / waitresses. Plus it is always packed, and I have felt very rushed here. Definitely not the same ambiance."
Mathew d.,"Astoria, NY",6,3,,3.0,8/14/2010,"service is hit or miss here.. you can tell they are such a corporate chain that it gets in the way of service.   the food is good - nothing amazing, nothing horrible.  Also,  something about watching a bartender measure their pours into a jigger in this atmosphere is cheap and not classy to me...only because I think they are worried about their liquor costs - not the integrity of the cocktail.  This isn't a mixology place -  but as always, just an opinion.  and PS  the brunch menu is amazing, which is the sole reason for 3 stars!"
Maria S.,"Darien, IL",12,85,,4.0,6/30/2010,"Always get the best service and never disappointed! Portions are HUGE! a bit pricey but worth it! Love the bruschetta  pungent flavors all meld together so well! Fish tacos are the best!  love the garlic mashed and the pork chops, mmmm....Soups and sammy's are not bad either. and OF COURSE the star of the show.... CHEESECAKE!! I have NOT had a bad flavor yet!"
Godislove S.,"Dupage County, IL",0,26,32,4.0,1/8/2011,"Good food and restaurant ambiance/decor.  Always very packed for lunch or dinner.  Great service, lots of varieties of food, love the bread basket.  And great cheesecake dessert!"
John O.,"Geneva, IL",82,181,12,4.0,3/10/2010,Not just Cheesecake. Try the Jambalya here. It's a big hearty bowl but don't forget to leave room for the cheesecake. Kinda of a loud place but it suits the atmosphere. An overwhelming menu with all different types of foods from different regions. Can be pricy though.
Andrea B.,"Warrenville, IL",0,5,3,4.0,11/20/2012,"Overall, good food, good cocktails, good service.  I would say it's next to find a restaurant in the suburbs that has 5-star food or service, but 4 will do just fine...."
Martin D.,"Willowbrook, IL",23,46,7,4.0,8/7/2010,"We had to end our being ""Tourist for a Day"" with dessert and cheesecake sounded perfect. My gal had the Dulce de Leche and I had the Pineapple Upside Down Cheesecake. My gal actually gave shared a bite of hers with me and I must say hers was better than mine. Mine was loaded with flavor and a must have for the pineapple fan. Either way, you can not lose. Next time though, I will get the Red Velvet Cheesecake. It was my initial choice, but the girl there sold me on my choice. In the end, it is all cheesecake...can you lose?"
Amy T.,"Chicago, IL",0,51,,3.0,7/23/2010,"I've always liked The Cheesecake Factory, but when  I really thought about it all I could of said that it was A-OK.  I hardley get to go there, even when it's early afternoon, because it's ALWAYS crowded. I don't want to wait for 2 hours to eat!   Service- Okay, I've had good and bad experience. It can sometimes be slow, especially if it's very crowded. Make sure you make a reservation! Food- It's nice to have the choice of breakfest, lunch, or dinner meals. But the food is okay. My pasta seemed over cooked which I wasn't very pleased about.  Food can come in VERY LARGE PORTIONS! Cheesecake is amazing! Price - Moderate. It can get pricey!"
rs s.,"Tampa, FL",0,23,,5.0,5/30/2012,We love this place. After eating at many restaurants we keep comparing and finding them inferior to chessecake factory. good drinks and desserts. lots of choices which are good size (even appetizers and small plates) and well presented. Sometimes they have a long wait but it is always worth it.
Angie G.,"Chicago, IL",3,77,,4.0,4/5/2010,"Why am I writing a review for a place that already has 40? Oy. As far as chain restaurants go, The Cheesecake Factory is decent. It's one of my mom's favories, so we stand in long lines on Mother's Day for her. I just ate lunch with a friend at the Oak Brook location, and ultimately it wasn't a bad deal. I had a tostada salad (something like that) and it was literally piled high. Literally. I had two piles of lettuce and cilatro, tomatoes, black beans, and avocado cream. Yum. Huge portions are their thing, but this was by far the largest portion I've ever had at any cheesecake factory. The sandwiches and burgers here--I've had nearly all of them--are your average, run-of-the-mill sandwiches and burgers. Nothing remarkable, but nothing terrible. All are pretty forgetable. The cheesecakes here are almost always superb, which is good, because it makes you forget your sub-par meal. My one complaint is that half the darn slice is covered in whipped cream. Dis.Gus.Ting. Even when I've asked--at multiple locations, mind you--I always get large mounds of whipped cream on my cheesecake. It's clearly company policy, but WHY???? Cheesecake don't need no frills. For a decent meal and a place that will satisfy everyone, this is the place to go. It's pretty vanilla, so it's a good standard for everyone, but it's not my first choice and probably never will be."
Amy L.,"Aurora, IL",4,24,3,1.0,2/8/2014,This is the second time I've done curbside to go and the second time I was highly irritated so I thought I'd write a review.  Both times I've done curbside I've had to wait forever outside after calling the number to let them know I was there. Today I had to wait 25 additional minutes beyond the 20 min wait for my food. In that 25 min I called FOUR times to ask where my  food was. Finally I went inside and got my food. All I was offered was a drink while he got my food together. I laughed and said no. Fries were in my order and I knew they were going to be cold and soggy after all that time and I was right. Our sandwiches were soggy too. We are so disappointed. We don't eat food like that very often so this was a treat. Turns out it wasn't much of a treat. If you plan on doing curbside don't bother. Just go in and get it. It shouldn't take a village to get your food. Get it together Cheesecake Factory!!! And thanks for the horrible food and experience.
charlotte s.,"Stavanger, Norway",92,1233,31,4.0,4/10/2009,"came for lunch one day during the after-holiday-season-sales.... and of course the place was packed with hungry shoppers.   but luckily, i was able to grab one of the high tables in the bar soon after i had gotten the 'beeper'.... saved at least 30 minutes of waiting time... woo hoo. our server was obviously super busy, but she was nice and accommodating to us not being ready to order when she came and asked us the first time around.... i know that sucks when a table isn't ready to order yet especially when you're busy and need to keep your rythm.... finally we ordered... eventually got our food... ate... she checked on us... things were fine.... when we were done our table was cleared and we asked for the check etc.... so 4 stars for our pleasant server who kept her cool despite being super busy :) other than that.... we all know one cheesecake factory's just like the other.... the same huge menu, the same big dining room, it's loud, it's crowded, it's frantic and hectic and there's always a herd of people at the entrance and lobby waiting for a table while holding their vibrating beepers....  it's what it is..."
Sarah R.,"Chicago, IL",5,42,,2.0,3/22/2010,"I've experienced so much better.  The service was horrible...horrible to the point where the waiter in the next section took our order because our waiter was no where to be found.  Yes, it was busy but that place is always busy.   Since the food was good, I'm giving it two stars instead of one."
Katrina H.,"Chicago, IL",76,335,73,4.0,12/26/2009,Lots of FOOD for your money!! and it's all delicious!! so much that you eat maybe 3 bites and you're ready to take everything home!! .. the staff was a bit slow tonight after Christmas day.. maybe our server had to much to drink the night before but you'd think that she would've cared to get an extra Holiday Tip! well NOT!! everything was super Delayed until she got into her groove.. that was almost halfway into our mealtime there. The food is always great. I was disappointed not to see Aunt Sheilas Cajun Chicken Pasta.. .. ohh well.
Patrick W.,"Carol Stream, IL",2,15,,2.0,8/22/2007,"The quintessential 3 hour lunch. If you want to kill an afternoon in Oak Brook, or need a break from shopping, by all means, eat here. The menu is huge, but I think that's because they don't specialize in anything other than cheesecake. The food is simply average. It's just rather generic and bland, and overpriced to boot. As much as I dislike the Cheesecake Factory experience, I have to say, the cheesecake is amazing, and is the reason for the extra star in my review.  What I like to do is eat someplace else and then come here and get some cheesecake take-out to go. Skip right to the best part."
K G.,"Berkeley, CA",7,95,6,4.0,11/3/2009,"Back when I was vehemently a Bay Area ""anti-chain"" person, I would have given this a bad review just for being a chain. In fact, because the CF was so darn popular when they first appeared on the scene sometime in the early 90's, I avoided them for just that reason alone. Well, the other reason being that they were always crowded and don't take reservations; they would like you to have to shop the mall or wait and look at the cakes before you eat. Okay, so having said all that, this place really does a great job. It's a top quality chain. For one thing, they have the consistency down pat, almost as well as MacDonalds. Really! They always look the same, beautiful decor with the perfect lighting. You will always feel warm and cozy and romantic here. It's the right amount of noise, and privacy in every table and booth. Wonderful job, designers. Atmosphere is always perfect. I really enjoyed sitting outside at the Oakbrook Mall in September, with the heat lamps too! Service is always outstanding. They again emphasize consistency here, friendly, upbeat, not pushy, service. I love how they are happy to split something like a salad or cake without making you feel like a cheapskate. They put it on two plates without even asking. I think that the food is good. You can get any type of food you want; Italian, American, Mexican, even sort of Nouvelle Cuisine for some of the special entrees. The sauces are yummy, again totally consistent, and the quality is good. In addition, I don't think it's a terribly expensive place. I liked the Mac and Cheese a lot (lots of garlic), I loved the fajitas, and the scampi. I also really like their sandwiches and appreciate the willingness to totally alter whatever is on the menu to suit my picky tastes with no questions or frowns! Of course, their cakes are wonderful too. I love the red velvet cake the best. It's a sure thing. Good job, guys. Keep up the good work! Keep Americans eating and shopping all across the country!"
Tamara S.,"Toledo, OH",161,112,77,4.0,8/28/2009,I generally had a good time here.  It was a shoe in because my hotel was right next door...but I was pleasantly satisfied.  I had heard about the cheesecake and I am not really a fan...so actually went for dinner.  I had the meatloaf...my plate was full and I was pleased.  I even ended up taking some home.  It tasted great and I would recommend it to anyone. The drinks were also nice and they had a nice selection of food and drinks as well as cheesecake of course.  I took home some vanilla bean cheesecake as well as some carrot cake and was in heaven.  I definitely would visit again...
