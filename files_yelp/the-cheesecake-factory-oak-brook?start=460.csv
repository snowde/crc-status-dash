T C.,"Evergreen Park, IL",0,1,,2.0,4/18/2012,Came here with the family a week ago.had high expectations but was disappointed. I ordered the Spaghetti (tasted like it cam right out of a can). My lemonade was crazy sweet as if it needed additional sugar on the rim of the cup.Not going back.sorry
Jen G.,"Normal, IL",55,24,12,2.0,5/8/2011,"Ants. Daughter dropped napkin under the booth. Went to get it; came back with no less than 30 ants on the napkin, her clothes and her. Daughter had to go outside to be brushed off. No way management didn't know, and no way that was the only table. We were moved, but another family was sitting there before we had our food. server did what he could, and dessert wad free, but 2 days later 3 year old daughter still talking about ANTS. Yuck"
Michelle I.,"Bolingbrook, IL",290,389,107,4.0,4/1/2007,"I love The Cheesecake Factory! The only thing that stops me from giving it a perfect score is because the wait time is awful at times. You will be moved around like cattle in that matter. They do act like we should be blessed to be able to get a table in their restaurant. And for $50 - $60 for two for a full lunch, they should be more friendly. The food is excellent, the portions are HUGE! If you can possibly find something to chose to split- do so- you will not make it to the cheesecake! Their menu is monsterous, you need 20 minutes just to make a choice! Try the Tex Mex Eggrolls for a appetizer or the Crispy Pork Tenderloin for your entree. I could drink a gallon of their Iced Green Tea. Yum!"
Lizzi C.,"Elmhurst, IL",112,82,2,3.0,10/30/2006,"Lots of fun to bring a big group here...Great atmosphere and bar area...Kind of noisy, but the food is delicious (if you can make up your mind about what you want to eat off the lengthy menu).  Try the curbside service if you aren't in the mood for a big crowd.  The wait staff is very friendly.  The fried macaroni and cheese, and the crab wontons are to die for.  For dinner try the crabcake sandwich or the orange chicken.  Very expensive...I still can't accept the fact that a slice of cheesecake is around $8-but you can't beat the oreo and key lime versions."
Sean D.,"Downers Grove, IL",0,8,,4.0,1/11/2011,"I had been to a Cheesecake Factory once before in California a few year ago but never been to this location before.  I went with three other friends last night for dinner so it wasn't too busy.  We got seated right away and dug into the menu.  Wow, this place has a lot of food on the menu! The beer selection is also quite large and I'm glad they had Newcastle.  Our waitress carded me (yay!) and we started off with taquitos, which were pretty good.  I ended up getting the Hibachi steak and it came with bean sprouts some sort of mashed potatoes and tempura aspargus (yuck).  I passed on the asparagus but everything else was great. For dessert I got the vanilla bean cheesecake, which sounds better than it tastes but it was still yummy. Service was good, as our waitress was constantly checking up on us and my friends were all satisfied. Prices are a little higher than most other restaurants but the place looked nice and the menu selection is awesome."
Lindley E.,"Chicago, IL",276,850,43,3.0,10/23/2006,totally and utterly consistent from store to store.  Now will someone please tell me why people wait up to an hour to eat here? Please?
mike q.,"Downers Grove, IL",1,29,,4.0,6/5/2009,Not big on chains but I must say after dining there twice for a chain they do a great job. Both visits we took the waiters advice and went with the specials. This last time we had the Salmon and the Maui. They were both excellent Maui was served with MP and spinach for $20.00. The waiter ( Jim ) was very attentive and professional. I would have expected to pay twice what it cost for the same meal else where.  Its a good inexpensive dinner destination when going to Drury Lane.
Hannah T.,"Chicago, IL",6,4,,4.0,9/30/2010,I really like this place. Have been many times and everything I try from drinks to entrees are pretty good! Esp my favorite red velet cheesecake. Very good!

Ellie M.,"Chicago, IL",13,53,,4.0,6/4/2009,I love this place and ofcouse they have Cheesecake duh. After all is is called Cheesecake factory. But the food is pretty dahm good to. I definitely recommend the Ahi Tuna for starters pretty much every entree I've had I loved and for desert I would say the apple Carmel cheesecake it's to die for!!!!
Andrew J.,"Oak Park, IL",3,90,,4.0,5/1/2008,"When people say that the menu here is long, they are not kidding.  There are probably hits and misses, but my asian chicken salad was big, light, and tasted great.  Would not hesitate to go back."
Ebru Y.,"Orange County, CA",37,248,33,3.0,6/27/2006,"First of all, for such a gorgeous and very appetizing restaurant like this, they need to have a good manager with professional hiring experience/skills. And he or she needs to start by giving that hostess at the door an attitude adjustment! I cannot believe how rude some people get when the income they make is coming straight out of that customer's pocket. I am not saying they need to worship the customers and bow down in front but have some respect at least! We walked in here because I was in the area for an interview, and wanted to grab a quick lunch before my interview. We walked up to say we need a table for 2, and she was just giving us this blank look as if we are the employees and she is the customer. She was like ""Yeah?"" and then she was like, ok you'll need to move and wait over there pointing away from where she was standing, and we wanted to ask about sitting outside, and she just cut us off saying, okay you need to go wait over there pointing, as if we are some animals, you don't even treat an animal like that! Other than this rude person, the food was awesome as usual, it's a huge place with a lot of space, you could have a wedding reception here lol Our waitress was very nice and friendly. The only other thing is, each time somebody came to our table, to take the order, to bring the food, bring the bill, take the bill, ring up the sale, bring us water, it was another person. So it was kind of not fair to tip only one person. To me this is kind of absurd. Let one person do the work!"
