Brittany R.,"Houston, TX",191,15,,2.0,8/11/2017,"Stayed across the street at the hotel. Ate this three nights in a row via takeout, on the third night I was on hold for over 25 minutes. Had to call back three separate times because I was just being set on hold. On the third call I asked to speak with a manager able to take a to go order. Was left there for an additional 10 minutes. Hung up and called back a manager immediately picked up sounded like she was in the back office, she told me that there was a long line of people and that's why I was on hold for so long. She didn't know that I was staying at the hotel across the street, so when I WALKED by I saw two people there. I got the manager on the phone just to let her know that we took our business elsewhere. Riddle me that."
Erin K.,"Addison, IL",7,130,214,4.0,1/23/2017,"Almost always perfect! Love the food, pretty much something for any and every one! A bit on the pricey side, but there is definitely quantity and quality here. Ambiance is loud, but very pretty."
Tiffany P.,"Downers Grove, IL",323,253,723,3.0,7/30/2015,"I come here once in a while because it's right by my work.  This Cheesecake factory always seems to get us seated fairly quickly whether it's for lunch or for dinner. However, be warned that if you come for lunch, you will be here for a good solid hour or more! They do not provide good quick lunches for business folk.  Everything on the menu has been okay for me- from salads to sandwiches, appetizers; all of it seems fairly good franchizey kind of food. I've never had anything really excellent, but I've never had anything terrible either. One thing is awesome is the cheesecake- there's no denying it! However at about $8 a slice, you'd think they could lower the price.  Cheesecake factory is a middle-of-the-road place for those shopping at the mall."
Melissa D.,"Aurora, IL",75,9,,5.0,8/14/2017,I went here on Sunday & all of our food was fresh and so delicious. It was a big group of us & they got everyone's food right. The fried Mac & cheese was so delicious & the spinach dip. My pasta was good as well. Can't wait to go back and eat more.
Laura M.,"Geneva, IL",0,9,1,1.0,10/22/2017,"This place has really gone down hill...terrible food, terrible service but packed so I guess they don't give 2fs? Were seated immediately, but it took 15 minutes for the stoned waiter Sc*tt to come over, another 15 for him to bring us our drinks. The food came out relatively quick but my omelette was over cooked yet cold, my daughter's pasta was ok but skimped on the chicken. The aforementioned Sc*tt kept disappearing (nice shark eyes btw) and it took forever to get the check. He said that he ""tried"" to talk to the manager to get my meal comped but that he wouldn't do anything. I also tried to get the manager's attention (bald guy, huge beard) but it looked like he was more into his fantasy football than serving customers!"
Drew M.,"Downers Grove, IL",121,25,10,5.0,7/23/2017,"Great service, great food! I always love coming to this location, great every time.  I ordered the four cheese pasta with alfredo sauce which was fantastic.  We had a thirty minute wait but it went by quick and our food came out 10 minutes after ordering which was impressive given how busy they were."
Tiffany F.,"Chicago, IL",35,147,280,4.0,11/17/2015,"I really love the food at Cheesecake Factory. There really is something for everyone, no matter your tastes. Their menu is almost too big... You have to make sure to read it from page to page so you don't miss anything! I would rather have a bit menu than a small menu any day... We came here most recently on a Sunday evening after shopping at oakbrook. We really didn't think it was going to be as busy as it was, but there was a 30-45 minute wait! We luckily were able to find a seat at the bar and didn't have to wait.  The bartenders were all attentive, though it was a little confusing on who you were supposed to order from. Our bread got forgotten twice and we had to remind them, then it never even came in the end. They also brought out two of my salads, so not sure what happened there.  I like that they have lighter options as well as your normal menu options. We got a few appetizers and a salad, and of course cheesecake!"
Dymond H.,"Bellwood, IL",0,6,1,4.0,3/1/2017,This is a very nice restaurant! My waitress Megan was very nice and respectful. I would recommend that all my friends and come here especially because the food is inexpensive!
Neil B.,"East Galesburg, IL",0,1,,5.0,10/26/2017,Very good food and very good service! Dawn was our waitress and she was very good at what she does! And the cheesecake was so good and sweet I feel as if I should see the dentist tomorrow!
Asim R.,"Lombard, IL",0,112,12,4.0,7/24/2017,"Gotta love the menu, if you can't find something you like, then you should go home. Definitely a novelty restaurant. But I've never been disappointed. Always good to keep this in your selection of possibilities. Again good to fair price. Good volume of food, and taste is usually better than good. It sounds loud inside, service is usually good in Oakbrook, the downtown not so good!!"
Darl B.,"Hinsdale, IL",48,202,,3.0,2/24/2017,"Cheesecake mgr here wrote in part 'during your next visit, if there is anything wrong with your meal please let our managers know so we can make things right' This is not acceptable as a response because my answer to you is NO I WILL NOT let a manager know. You have exactly ONE chance with me. If you cant get it right I will NOT wait while the kitchen remakes or have the manager comp me of anything of the sort.  Like roughly 75% of patrons I dare say they dont want to go thru the hassle. I sure dont/wont. So instead will simple deal with the problems and post here and remember for future choices. It is a cop out to say tell us so we can fix because YOU KNOW WHEN IT LEAVES THE KITCHEN IT IS SUBPAR BUT YOU LET IT OUT ANYWAY ON PURPOSE. For that you get no second changes just my wrath and non repeat business. This is called the restaurant industry. deal with it just GET IT RIGHT. end of story."
Hassan G.,"Roselle, IL",475,134,388,4.0,3/14/2016,"I have been to Cheesecake Factory many times, first time at this location. and overall I am a fan, first of all the decor is great , the wait staff was nice, and i would pick Cheesecake Factory's Key Lime Cheesecake over any other Key lime cheesecake that I have had. the only negative that i would say is that this place is a little over priced, but overall it was good."
Candice T.,"Downers Grove, IL",51,15,,2.0,3/26/2017,My rating would be higher but I had asked the server to make me cheese quesadilla's to go for my son who was home sick.  I ordered it to be just cheese nothing else inside.  When I got home of course they were made with everything in it so my son didn't eat it and it was a total waste of money.
Erin R.,"Chicago, IL",29,10,1,5.0,7/11/2017,"We loved our lunch we had here last week at the Oak Brook location. Our food was great, but we had an awesome waiter Tyler, he was the best! We never had to wait for anything and he came and checked on us frequently."
Cesar Z.,"Chicago, IL",0,6,,3.0,7/20/2017,I when to cheesecake last Friday for lunch and when I got there it was 30 minutes wait but when we got finally the table it took 10 minutes wait for the server to come and offer bread and drinks after that when we order the food took more than 30 minutes and on top of that the food was cold and very dried
Jude A.,"St. Charles, IL",105,7,1,5.0,9/4/2016,"My family had a group of 22 people (mostly adults with a few young kids aged 4 months to 15 years old) and this place was fantastic! I know that Cheesecake Factory does not take reservations so my mom, dad, grandma, and myself arrived around 3:45pm to hopefully get seated by 5pm for our large group. The hostess informed me that a manager would take care of me when I put down the group name and number. He told me that he could get us seated in 20 minutes.  Unfortunately, my family took longer to arrive than anticipated due to their children's sleep schedule. However, the manager worked with us to get 11 of us seated. Then an amazing waiter by the name of Steven helped us save two (and then a third) table for our group as the stragglers arrived. The appetizers were brought out promptly. Also, the refills were done without asking a few times which is always a plus! Even when Steven took his break because he was going to work a long shift, the servers and food runners did not skip a beat bringing out out our food, refills, and silverware. The food was delicious as usual. Overall, everything was amazing with our big group which normally is a hassle in a place that doesn't accept reservations but was a combination of luck, timing, and wonderful service (from the hostess, manager, server - Steve, and the food runners)! Thank you!"
Julie M.,"Lisle, IL",96,2,,5.0,1/15/2017,"I don't know how this place has any negative reviews. Yes the wait time is long on weekends, but of course that's when any restaurant is the most busy and that just proves how much people love this place! Personally, I thought it was worth the wait. We ordered a lot of appetizers; calamari, cheesy bread, edamame, all of it was Delicious! Our dinners themselves were just as satisfying and there is something for everyone.  The cheesecake, as expected, was excellent and the portions were huge slices. Absolutely going back as soon as I can!"
Marq C.,"Schaumburg, IL",599,328,686,3.0,4/17/2015,"3 stars for great location (oak brook mall), great tasting food, and good service.  I'm not a fan of chain restaurants so I usually won't eat at one at my own will but Cheesecake Factory  gets me every time. I take my clients for business lunch here often because of the variety in food. The variety range from Chinese to French cuisine! And plus their cheesecakes are truly decadent! MUST HAVE: tamale cakes for appetizer, southwest chicken chipotle pasta, & Hershey's chocolate cheesecake.  This is my first time ordering from their skinny menu. My order had hair in it so I didn't take one bite of if. I was offered by the server to get another entree but who knows if they will just remove the hair, stick it in the microwave and re serve the same dish??? So as hungry as I was, I refused to eat anything there at that time. It just took away my appetite. But I will most definitely come back!"
Thomas B.,"Grand Blanc, MI",23,205,44,5.0,10/22/2016,It doesn't get any better than this especially only waiting 5 mins for a table unlike our last visit to novi michigan location where we waited over 2 hours. Wife had salmon and shrimp scampi and I had steak diane and their awesome top selling chicken dish   also had  a Greek salad that was very good and of course we both enjoyed our desserts. Strawberry shortcake for me and chocolate truffle cake for my wife. Both awesome. We will return.
Mike R.,"Yorkville, IL",4,20,2,5.0,6/4/2017,"I LOVE this place!! Excellent service every time we go, the food is consistent and delicious no matter what location we go to. the ambiance is very beautiful and welcoming. By far one of my favorite places to eat since we've never once had a poor experience. Bravo!"
