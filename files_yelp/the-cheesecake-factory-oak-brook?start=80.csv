Jeffrey S.,"Midvale, UT",1995,1695,2762,3.0,2/17/2016,"'Murica. I submit that this chain is the new poster child for 'Murica. It's supplanted the Red Lobsters and Olive Gardens and Chilis and Applebee's of the world (arguably) and now represents a night out with your parents. For your consideration: EXHIBIT A That menu is massive. If you can't find something you like, then you clearly don't like eating out. Not that it's masterfully prepared, but just that it covers the gamut from pastas to salads to burgers and steaks and chops and pizza and every dang thing in between. It's sensory overload, and it's perfectly American. We love our variety. We love one of everything.  EXHIBIT B The portions are massive. So, I don't want to jump on the bandwagon about big Americans, but the numbers don't lie. Numbers notwithstanding, I have also noticed that when I travel abroad, the serving sizes are smaller. Paint it how you like--American excess or a culture that seeks out good value--but the portions are honkin' huge here.  EXHIBIT C Dessert. So much dessert. And again, our national colors are red, white, blue and sugar. And there's plenty of it. Pages of cheesecake. So much. And some of it (like the cookie dough one I tried) is so sugared and tricked out, you don't really know you're eating cheesecake. Do yourself a favor and stick with a simple kind. EXHIBIT D  Massive interior. This location seemed to go on forever. I went for a hike the left from the hostess stand trailhead and I stopped for food along the way. So many tables. We love our big spaces! All that said, my hat is off to them for being open and feeding a road-weary dude like myself. They were open until midnight and still firing food at 11:30 when I rolled in. The pasta and chicken I had, while salty and rich, was still hot and served fast, so I could get to my hotel and get to bed."
Tick...tick...tock...Clock C.,"Seattle, WA",9,499,42,1.0,7/30/2016,"I have been to other Cheesecake Factory locations...this one has the worst service and is staffed with RUDE adults who behave like children.  I actually walked out of this location after an incident when I was being seated.  -I was being seated by myself for lunch-I wanted a quick meal with food I recognized that was in walking distance from the hotel I was staying at- Le Méridien -I just waited a few minutes before the hostess came out to seat me.  -When she took me to the table there was a table that was getting thier order taken by the waiter and he was blocking the way into the seating area that I was going to be sitting at.  I was just standing right behind the waiter so the hostess came up to the side of the waiter and tapped him on the shoulder so he could move to the side so I could sit.  -He turned around and yelled at me ""Where do you want me to go?!""-He thought I was the hostess...I stated to him ""Wow, I am sorry..."" then he tried to back track and say he wasn't talking to me but he was trying to yell at his fellow employee...really that is how you speak t the people who you work with? Publicly in the middle of the restaurant floor in front of other employees and other patrons? WOW...  I walked out- I live in Manhattan and on the Island there isn't a Cheesecake Factory you have to go out to the NY suburbs...SO I thought I would get my fix here...I guess not.  If you want RUDE and unprofessional service-come on by..."
Melissa Z.,"Lyons, IL",1,10,1,5.0,12/2/2016,HOW DO PEOPLE NOT LIKE CHEESECAKE I JUST CANT! I CANT WRAP IT AROUND MY HEAD!! ITS freakinnnnnnn AMAZING! :)   Especially here! You do not go to the cheesecake factory and not eat cheesecake its like a rule of thumb i love their mango cheesecake!  Nice fancy romantic setting.
Shirley H.,"Chicago, IL",4,49,49,4.0,4/18/2016,"Finally dine in cheese cake factory, waiting only 20mins.  I ordered grilled salmon with mashed potato. Mashed potato is a little dry. Salmon is good. The sauce is like mayo with lemon, which matches the flavor of salmon.  Also I had a smore cheesecake, hmmmmmmm not guilty! I still think all the cheesecakes here are too sweet for me. But it just makes you feel soooo good when you have the taste of cheese cake in your mouth with some cream on top.  Also great weather for Oakbrook center. May shopping with my friend next week;)"
Lynn D.,"Lockport, IL",6,86,21,5.0,6/14/2017,Mom an daughter day! Enjoying life with my Mom! Lunch at Cheesecake Factory!  Our server is very nice an helpful! Thank you
Ray S.,"Elgin, IL",128,6,,1.0,5/19/2017,This place is horrible. Over 2 1/2 hour wait to be seated. They refuse to the reservations.  Absolute garbage.
Steve H.,"Batavia, IL",11,21,,1.0,5/16/2017,"I used to love the franchise and go to this location a few times a year.  No longer.  They changed my favorite dish, the Pasta da Vinci.  It used to be a wine reduction sauce which was delicious.  Now it's noddles swimming in oil.  When I asked my server about it, he made a joke about it and asked if I wanted another serving, while all I wanted was to understand how they could butcher what used to be awesome food.  I already knew their food wasn't very healthy but this made me loose my appetite and I will no longer eat there."
Dee A.,"Chicago, IL",69,86,139,3.0,8/6/2016,"To be honest, this is def not a bad restaurant! However, its not the best. The menu has too many options, and the food does not look like the pictures/ taste like them either. I used to come here a lot with my friends when I was in high school, but after I got older, I started to realize that there are so many other options for food that relevantly cost the same. I am not belittling the restaurant, the food does taste good. however, it is just not my go-to anymore."
Yvette M.,"Forest Park, IL",0,52,,4.0,5/14/2017,For Mother's Day my mom requested to have lunch here today. Called ahead to inquire about the wait time was informed by the young lady it would be 1 hour. Once we arrived the story changed to 20 minutes which was good. Waited about 10 minutes before being seated our waitress was good and attentive. My only negative we were seated next to a couple in which the gentleman complained about his waitress. His complaints went on and on which caused a problem due to my mom and I couldn't enjoy our meal in peace. Even the couple sitting on the opposite side of this couple found his constant complaining very annoying. Other than the constant complaining our experience was good and the food was great.
b k.,"Oak Park, IL",0,47,,3.0,5/11/2017,"I've stopped here for dinner a few times with my family and it's generally been fine -  nothing memorable, but convenient if we are stopping by the mall. Tonight I would have given it 2 stars for my mediocre meal, but my family had slightly better luck so I'll give it 3 stars overall. We arrived around 6pm when it wasn't busy (we had maybe a 10 minute wait for a table) yet it took nearly half an hour to get our food. I opted to try the eggplant parmesan with pesto pasta for the first time. I won't be ordering it again. The five eggplant medallions arrived looking tasty with a tightly wound side of very oily angel hair pasta that looked stiff. It was. I'm a fan of al dente pasta, but it mine was simply undercooked and tough. No problem, when our waiter, Stephen, passed by I let him know and he said he'd bring more.  In the meantime I was enjoying my eggplant medallions. Alas the last two were also undercooked - eggplant is good firm, but it shouldn't have any crunch to it! Because we wanted to head out, I didn't bother mentioning this to Stephen and just finished it up along with the fresh pasta (which was cooked properly although still way too oily.)  My daughter and wife had fine meals. We ordered a slice of cheesecake to go since we were running a bit late due to the slow service. Fortunately my daughter took a peek in the takeout bag because our server had brought the entirely wrong cheesecake. Not a big deal, but another delay and an easily avoided problem if he had just double checked the order. My takeaway from the evening is the reminder that there are better options in the mall area."
Amanda S.,"Berwyn, IL",196,3,1,1.0,6/2/2017,The fact that cheesecake forgot MY tossed salad or claimed they never got it is absolutely UNNECESSARY & UNEXCEPTABLE. I'm so pissed and disappointed bc I am on my lunch and wasted $10 that I should of kept. Never again doing a pick up order. Poorly customer service
Ricky L.,"La Grange, IL",0,6,,5.0,5/28/2017,"Never had a bad experience here. Food is always fantastic. Tried the fried macaroni cheese burger and oh man ... get the napkins cause it's messy. But well worth it. The burger itself is HUGE. Super filling, loved every bit. Definitely had to take a portion home. Cheese cake was excellent like always."
Felicia A.,"Chicago, IL",2,9,,2.0,9/6/2017,"Food is good.  Service is awful.  I literally would eat here all the time for lunch as I work very close.  However, their take out leaves a bit to be desired.  The last time I was there, the worker was throwing the butter around and shooting it in the bag like it was basketball.  Well, it hit my foot.  Also, I'm typically on hold for at least 10-15 minutes to place an order.   I'll try them in 3 months to see if their service has improved."
Alan L.,"La Grange, IL",20,63,13,5.0,12/22/2015,"We had a variety of dinners. Mine was the Chicken Constaleeta, was delicious . Chicken was mouth watering delicious with awesome mashed potatoes and asparagus. We topped off our dinners with the infamous cheesecakes. Service was terrific.  A gem of a restaurant!"
Z B.,"Chicago, IL",121,157,208,4.0,10/24/2015,"This is the one of the few Cheesecake Factory locations in Chicagoland. My experience wasn't as good as the Orland Park location, but I still had a great experience. The service was pretty good. The waitress I had struggled when she started serving us, but then she got better as the experience went on. She was friendly to us the whole time. It feels like she just started working at the place. The food was pretty good. They have great bread. It's nice and crunchy. I had the fried macaroni and cheese, and that tasted good. It was crunchy on the outside, and good on the inside. I also had the four cheese pasta with chicken. The pasta and the chicken both tasted good together. For dessert, I had the Oreo Dream Extreme cheesecake. It tasted like a dessert, and it also tasted fantastic. You have a bunch of ingredients in one cheesecake which taste really good. All in all, this is a good place for food and a fantastic place for dessert. I will be back here again."
Barb H.,"Orland Park, IL",0,14,,4.0,9/10/2017,"Good food, great service--thanks Sheila, our server.  We tried CF in Orland Park 3 times and they were aleays out of 1-2 things we ordered, and the service was ALWAYS horrible!  Been to Oakbrook twice and the service has been great!  Ehy can't that happen in Orland?"
Rachel H.,"Mishawaka, IN",43,32,58,4.0,1/10/2016,"Not only is this place beautiful, it has the best cheesecake!  The food is wonderful, I suggest the lettuce wraps. It has a full bar, the strawberry daiquiri was so good.   The Wait was a bit long (50 min) but in the end was worth it."
John K.,"Seattle, WA",24,22,,5.0,11/26/2016,"Pro:  good food, big portions, nice environment, right price. Cons:  Too many fucking shoppers at peak times. I love this place.  I'm a big fan of the cheesecake factory from many years ago.  Almost twenty years now."
Rachel W.,"Chicago, IL",1,27,60,3.0,3/20/2016,I went to dinner here this past week on st. patricks day. I was there with my boyfriend celebrating my birthday. I had never been to this location (I've only been to the location downtown). It looks nice inside and our waiter was very friendly and on top of everything. We were seated right away since we beat the dinner crowed. I would have given 5 stars but the food was very disappointing. :(  I ordered the Macaroni and Cheese Burger. The friend macaroni and cheese was gross. It tastes like cheap cheese. So I took that off. Then I noticed that the patty to bun ratio was ridiculous. The patty was so small compared to the bun it was actually comical. The burger just wasn't tasty. And the fries were your usual fries nothing special. My boyfriend ordered the Steak Diane and Shrimp Scampi. He said the shrimp was ok but the steak was very salty.  I wish I had chosen a different restaurant to have my birthday dinner at :(. Maybe I just ordered the wrong thing?
Minh-An C.,"Long Beach, CA",1078,979,3147,3.0,9/15/2014,"Like any other Cheesecake Factory, their specialities are their cheesecake and Italian food. My group of friends and I stopped by this place after our white coat ceremony on a Friday evening for dinner. My car was the last to come so we sat right away at the table but prior to everyone arriving, the restaurant did have a rule to not seat your party until everyone has arrived. I got the chicken and biscuit and a blue moon and the total with tax and tip came out to $30, which I think is a bit steep for the food I was getting. I really do enjoy Cheesecake Factory but the restaurant isn't super fancy or anything, but their food is quite pricey. Service was awesome and their bread is always delicious! My chicken and biscuit was a huge portion (which is fair since I paid so much for it anyways)..I ate half and took home the rest for dinner the next day. The biscuit was pretty good and I really like the mashed potatoes. The chicken was ehh, nothing too special.  I would suggest that if you are already willing to spend that much for dinner, you should check out Parkers or Maggiano's that's nearby.  Parking was very easy to find."
