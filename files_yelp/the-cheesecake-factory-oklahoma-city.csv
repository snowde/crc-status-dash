Eythan T.,"Davis, OK",112,35,,5.0,11/11/2017,"We came here after an event, and as expected, it looked packed. We walked in, and the hosts were very hospitable, patient and kind. Our waitress, Amanda, was patient as well (some in our party require it lol). We never had an empty cup the entire time we sat. She diligently checked on us every chance she got, without being annoying.  Our table ordered the chicken Madeira, the gumbo, the Evelyn's with angel hair and the Cajun nuggets. Everyone was absolutely astounded. It was great. Four of the six of us had never been here, but all were greatly impressed. I don't understand why this location only has 3 stars.  Thanks, Amanda!"
Donna C.,"Edmond, OK",162,55,26,3.0,1/7/2018,"For a chain restaurant, The Cheesecake Factory has pretty good food. The menu is a book with everything you could possibly think of. I've tried several of their dishes, but the only category that I found quite disappointing in taste and texture was the pasta. The wheat bread and butter is delicious. I'm not a fan of sourdough, so I am biased with my opinion on that. With our 20 minute wait, it gave my party plenty of time to look at the menu and pick our entrees. When we were seated, we ordered our drinks and went ahead and ordered our entrees to make things easier on our server (including a bowl of lemons for our water, straws, and extra bread). Service took a while. And we had to wait an additional 15 minutes for the items listed above. Food was good. I got the steak with salmon with a side of mashed potatoes and corn succotash. The asparagus were wilted and the size of match sticks. My family's entrees were also satisfying in taste. The server clearly forgot to put in an order and said under her breath as she was thinking, ""I'll get that out as soon as possible."" Not recognizing that she was at fault for this... (We're usually understanding and nice when we dine out, but I'll judge if you play it off like we forgot to tell you!!!)... so that kind of left a bad taste in my mouth.  Anywho, we finished out entrees, already had our meals boxed up and bagged. The server comes back with the missed order and told us it was actually taken to another table and they had to make a new one. Thanks?? We're clearly full. I was hoping it would get comped since we ordered this from the beginning, she had forgotten, and it came out when we were about to leave. We obviously paid it and took it togo... Tonight, it wasn't worth the hassle to even mention it. Justified that bad taste in my mouth, but.... whatevs. I noticed there's never a manager that walks around asking how things are going whenever I've visited. Cheesecake has always been divine. I recommend the Kahlua or the lemon raspberry.  Overall, the price is expensive so, expect to easily rack up your bill. I would come back only to order cheesecake or if invited in a group without say."
Mary Margaret M.,"Edmond, OK",72,147,2409,3.0,12/8/2017,"Classic Cheesecake Factory experience here: everything and the kitchen sink is on their menu. It's all served family style (one order is enough for a family of three-across the board).  My staple is the Louisiana chicken pasta. It's so subtly spicy and flavorful and a HUGE portion. One time at this location we found a hair (an obvious ""there's no way it's mine"" hair) in this dish. Staff was apologetic. They removed it from our check and replaced the dish with another one, which was the acceptable way to handle the situation.  Recently tried the Nashville chicken appetizer and it was good. I like the flavor-there could have been more pickles and a lot less grease.  Recently tried the Tuscan chicken from the Skinny-licious menu. There was enough meal there for 3 people; completely shareable for dinner for two with leftovers. The farro was skimpy, but I guess that's where the Skinny-licious part comes in. It was served with tons of tomatoes and had great flavor.  Cheesecake Factory cheesecake is universal at all locations, which I appreciate. Love the white chocolate raspberry. Recently learned a piece of cheesecake is somewhere in the neighborhood of 1,000-ish calories. Plan ahead and bring a cheesecake buddy (or several) who have similar tastes to you, or plan to take a week to eat it."
Jeff M.,"Oklahoma City, OK",422,586,1161,3.0,8/21/2017,"I've said it before, and I'll say it again: The Cheesecake Factory (TCF) is where willpower and waistlines go to die. And my goodness, it's so easy to fail at any healthy eating attempts if this place becomes a frequent stop for you. Supposedly, their 250 menu items are made from scratch daily, which makes me want to know what their definition of ""from scratch"" is more than anything. Prices have gone up though, so really, this is increasingly becoming a great place to get your dessert fix only, since there are definitely better options for dining out, even by chain restaurant standards. Our meal with family ended up being just slightly shy of $140. That's Cheever's money at that point. Speaking of increased prices... This happened yesterday: [] Update at the bottom of this essay [] I ordered something called the ""Crispy Chicken Costoletta"" listed on the menu at $17.95. ""Whatever"" I thought, since most everything on the menu is in that range. I figured the portions were going to be massive, so yay. Then the bill arrived, and I noticed that I was charged $19.45 for the CCC.  So I ask my server for clarification. I even had to point it out on the menu because he didn't seem like he believed me. A few minutes later, he comes back and tells me that his manager said that the prices had gone up on a number of the menu items by ""just a dollar"" (it's more than a dollar, but who's counting? Besides me...). And then he asked if it would be okay for me to go ahead and pay the $19.45. lolwut?  There were a number of options on how to deal with the price change(s):         (a) Take the low-effort Asian restaurant route, and cover the old price with a sticker.         (b) Eat the cost of your mistake, and fix the price when requested by the customer.         (c) Ask the customer politely to accept your bait & switch. He actually chose (c) and with manager approval too, it seems. I mean, yes, it's only $1.50, but I was like ""WTH?"" to even being told:  - Yeah, our prices changed...  - Yeah, we didn't note it anywhere...  - Yeah, could you go ahead and just pay the new price? No, guy. No. I mean, thanks for asking so nicely, but this was like the easiest customer-service resolution ever, and you botched it. And this weak-sauce customer service thing is the one thing (other than the delicious cheesecake) that seems to be oddly consistent about this TCF in particular. Man, this review got long...  P. S. I had someone from ""Guest Services"" reach out to me, to explain that you cannot do any substitutions. At all. The server had told me that I could swap out the mashed potatoes for the corn succotash, and it turns out that... You can't... So, yeah... Crispy Chicken Costoletta ($17.95) + Corn Succotash ($1.50) = $19.45. Okay, fair enough..."
Johna R.,"Edmond, OK",28,76,53,3.0,9/30/2017,"This is a great place for dinner if you have a family or group because their menu is extensive!  We had the fried macaroni and cheese to start and it was amazing! You get 4 balls and can easily share each one with someone. I had the skinnylicious (under 600 calories) burger and green salad. It was good, but nothing to write home about. The green salad was just lettuce. No other veggies were on the salad. I thought that was odd and the dressing they poured on it made the greens a little soggy.  Our service was okay, a little slow at times. The weather was perfect, which made for an excellent meal on their patio."
Hannah M.,"Oklahoma City, OK",110,211,538,3.0,8/10/2017,"Decided to Come in for lunch on a Tuesday since I didn't have my baby and enjoy lunch by myself. If you want a restaurant that has a ton of variety, this is your perfect spot! The menu is literally like a book. If you want a meal that is healthy and you are watching calories stick to the skinny licious menu only!! All of their dishes are not known to be the healthiest. Plus they give you delicious warm bread and butter while you wait for your food. I love their butter here it's so fresh.  I got the Renee special which is a half a turkey sandwich, House salad, and a cup of the soup of the day. My soup I got was chicken tortilla which was so cold and just not good at all. It was thicker than tomato soup almost and not a single tortilla chip in it!  The sandwich was fresh and hearty! salad was delicious but they drowned it in salad dressing and I hate when that happens. My waitress was good just slow she definitely wasn't in any hurry.. which is nice opposed to feeling rushed I guess. I just don't like it when you give change or place your order then they walk off and talk to two other tables making small talk.  All in all there are definitely other local favorites I have but if you're craving bread and of course cheesecake this is the place!"
Alan O.,"Midwest City, OK",5,79,121,4.0,12/9/2017,"The food was hot when it arrived to our table. That's always a good thing for the wife! It was worth the 20 minute wait though. Our waiter, Andrew, was on his game, despite also serving a large party next to us. I tried something different from the updated menu and had the Thai Curry Chicken, w/brown rice and mangos. As usual, my eyes were bigger than my stomach, so that meant I had to get a to go box. Cheesecake to go also!"
Joe C.,"Redondo Beach, CA",226,157,425,3.0,8/3/2017,This place is crowded and overpriced but the food is still good. The cheesecake is about $8 slice which to me is crazy but it is really good. I was here for the half price cheesecake day and $4.97 was more in line...
Andrea S.,"Texarkana, TX",94,193,232,5.0,8/2/2017,Here for the National Cheesecake day!  It's my second time on this location and I always get great food and service!
Steve L.,"Oklahoma City, OK",16,32,2,4.0,8/26/2017,"You can't go wrong with TCF, and this location never disappoints. The menu never changes, but why should it since it is about 8 pages. My wife always gets the Tea, it has a unique flavor with hints of fruit. It gives me the willies so I pass. But go for it if it's your bag. The absolute always order, no questions asked, is the chicken pot stickers as an appetizer. The sauce is spectacular, I never let any go to waste by sponging it up with the delicate stickers or delicious fresh bread. Tonight I was feeling adventurous. So I exchanged my usual, Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp (I'm a curry junkie) for the Miso Salmon. And let me tell you, it changed my life. Who knew salmon could taste so great in Oklahoma? The fish was fresh, flaked properly, and was covered in a Miso sauce that was oh so creamy fantastic.  I passed on cheesecake tonight. But recommend the Red Velvet. It has the most  calories of them all. Enough said."
Missy D.,"Oklahoma City, OK",1,5,7,5.0,11/15/2017,The food was great. We ate there to celebrate my birthday and we had a wonderful time. Our  waiter and the rest of the staff were great and very attentive! The Mac N Cheese balls were delicious and so was the Snickers Cheese Cake. We will definitely eat there again!
Eric F.,"Mesquite, TX",16,74,10,1.0,5/22/2017,Never ever ever have we received such horrible service.  The waitress was not the best and perhaps the worst I have ever had.   I have been to several cheesecake factory's around the US. This is by far the worst.  I can't wait to get back to Texas and go to a cheese cake factory and have some good food and service.
Katy C.,"Oklahoma City, OK",101,93,55,2.0,7/31/2017,The food is so-so even though the variety is phenomenal.  They are REALLY strict about promos-we went for half off Cheesecake day and they would only give us one slice half off  The staff seems overwhelmed and there is always a wait! The ambience is dressy but there are always people there in flip flops.
Bryan S.,"Moore, OK",11,135,386,5.0,5/19/2017,Date night last Friday was super awesome and our server was legit! Our server was very attentive and our drinks never got low. She refilled our bread as I couldn't resist eating it. The garlic bread if you have never had it is a must try. You can thank me later!! Oh my it's decadent! Our Louisiana chicken pasta was simply heavenly.  We got cheesecake to go and we're very pleased with our visit. We definitely will return to this Cheesecake Factory! Thank you again!
Royal T.,"Oklahoma City, OK",2,19,1,1.0,11/8/2017,Brunch was disappointing last weekend.  Seating was immediate.  Bread was never brought.  The menu is too big (it actually has page numbers).  Overpriced food took forever.  Drinks were warm and food (omelet and potatoes) cold.  Waitress never returned after food was dropped off and neither will I.
Olivia T.,"Edmond, OK",145,268,1062,4.0,8/21/2017,"I'm a huge fan of the Cheesecake Factory primarily for their vast selection of scrumptious cheesecakes. One of my cheesecake missions in life is to try ALL of their cheesecake flavors and still have all of my teeth and no diabetes. With that in mind, I can only try a new flavor or two every year because my sweet tooth craves different things. I've tried a lot of the flavors on the menu. I'm a huge fan of the raspberry white chocolate truffle, the red velvet, lemon meringue, dulce de leche, salted caramel, celebration cheesecake, and the Adam's peanut butter (in no particular order). The food here is pretty good, but there are places locally in Oklahoma that has better foods, so I don't come here for dinner unless there was a friend's birthday or work event. This is the only Cheesecake Factory in Oklahoma City metro areas and they get very busy all the time. I'm definitely a fan and I LOVE their cheesecakes."
Neema F.,"Wichita, KS",55,12,6,3.0,5/30/2017,"This was not the greatest Cheesecake Factory experience. The service was okay. It seemed like other tables waiters were helping us more than our own.  My food was excellent. I had the Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta. Everything about it was great, but it wasn't as spicy as I wanted it to be. My father had the Chicken Riesling. The taste was meh. It was also really oily. When you took a bite you could just taste the oil coat your mouth. My mom had the Chicken Parmesan Pizza Style. For the most part it was good. It was pretty average, nothing that was really surprising or great about it. My sister had the Santa Fe Chicken Salad. Her food was amazing as always. One of the best salads at any restaurant. My Grandma had the Southwest Chicken Sandwich. This was really good. Because the bread was so fresh, it made the sandwich absolutely amazing."
Tasha J.,"Atlanta, GA",1,176,226,4.0,9/25/2017,"I came here after having gross hotel food.  I wanted something good and familiar and that's what I got.   The service was slow, my waiter was covering a lot of tables. My food was piping hot and tasted good but there were some foreign ingredients that made it into my food.  Since I don't have food allergies it wasn't a big deal but something to consider for those with special diets. I lost patience waiting on my check so I skipped the cheesecake because I was concerned about how long I'd have to wait..."
C J.,"Oklahoma City, OK",4,30,18,1.0,2/8/2017,This was terrible. Terrible terrible terrible. (Sounds better if you pretend Charles Barkley is saying it) I wanted to grab a quick bite with the family before I headed out town for work. I let my daughter pick and she picked here. This place always sounds better than it is.  From the beginning it was terrible. They asked if I had any children in the party. (I get this. I was single and childless once but. Come on. Let's not be so obvious). I said yes and they sat me in the worst table by the kitchen. I sure hope the waiter I had was new because he was terrible. About 10 minutes from being seated to him coming to the table. Then. He dropped off the menus  and I had to stop him from leaving to give him a drink order. It got worse from there. Like I said. I hope he was new.  The food was gross. My daughter got garlic noodles. Obvious garlic salt and I think they spilled it in there. It was saltier than anything I have ever had. I probably should check my blood pressure.  I had sausage and shrimp. Sauce was terrible and the sausage had about as much a presence as you will see in a women's locker room.  Children's menu was typical of a place that really doesn't want children.  Dessert. Couple pieces of cheese cake. I really do not see what the hype is.  There was obviously no real baker back there. Frozen???? The bill was $129. Not cheap. I could have gone to one of the new fun restaurants in OKC for that price.  Stay away.
Krista H.,"Oklahoma City, OK",5,82,129,4.0,3/25/2017,"Four stars because the atmosphere was great on a date night with my husband. He had the steak tacos-he liked them. I had the steak medallions-they were ok: I was expecting it to taste like steak slices and they tasted more like Salisbury steak.I enjoyed the asparagus,mushrooms, and tomatoes the most on the dish! Nice place"
Amy R.,"Moore, OK",89,76,17,2.0,3/16/2017,"My boss gave me a gift card for my birthday, so we came here (hadn't been in a while). My husband got steak Diane and I got a chicken parm sandwich.  He loved his (me too). I completely disliked mine (the marinara seemed like ketchup). Per usual, we got Adams PB cup.  The total bill was $60, thankfully the gift card covered 25 because the meal was worth about 30.  I'd go back, just to grab a cheesecake to go."
Samuel M.,"McKinney, TX",5,40,126,5.0,8/13/2017,"Cheesecake Factory is the perfect place in OKC to hang and dine outside.  I always enjoy what I choose from their menu options, which I should add, is the grandest option filled menu around.  My fav is the White Bean Chicken Chili but I try to explore and tday I had the Pasta Napoletana.  It was delicious and just the right size to not make me feel over full afterwards."
Ethan H.,"Edmond, OK",212,172,791,5.0,6/7/2016,"L'Shawn was our server and he did a great job.  We started with the Cuban Spring rolls. So delicious! They come with a wonderful sauce to dip in as well. Our entrees were an extremely large Caesar salad and the combo. We chose steak Diane (cooked medium rare) and the herb crusted salmon.  These dishes were fantastic as well. But you can't go to The Cheesecake Factory and not get dessert!  We had the White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle, a creamy cheesecake swirled with white chocolate and raspberry and the Lemon Raspberry Cream Cheesecake, a raspberry-vanilla cake, creamy lemon cheesecake, raspberry lady fingers and lemon mousse.  Both were great, but the lemon one was divine. Casual dining at fine dining prices. A treat every once in a while."
Angeles V.,"Oklahoma City, OK",0,4,1,4.0,8/31/2017,Always great! Had the Vietnamese summer rolls and they were delicious! Although our waitress was a bit rude but what can you do /-:
Heather M.,"Manter, KS",0,31,9,5.0,8/20/2017,Great service! Had a party of 8 they sat us within 10 minutes of arrival durning lunch time. We were celebrating a recent birthday and a family vacation. The food was all wonderful as was the cheesecake. We will definitely be back next time we are in town. Highly recommend the crispy crab cakes!
Lauren A.,"Yukon, OK",55,36,4,3.0,6/15/2017,"EDIT: I've been told that the food doesn't come frozen. Fine and dandy, but it certainly tastes it at this location. There are restaurants in the city where you can taste the freshness of the food for a fraction of the price. And how ""none of the food is frozen"" when they have a menu the size of a Harry Potter book is beyond me.  The food is outrageously overpriced. I'm no fool - this is a chain restaurant. The $20 plates of food come frozen in bags. Tastes good, but not worth the price. I can spend less on a plate at a restaurant that uses fresh ingredients and makes things from scratch.  However, there are two things to come here for: the cheesecake and the appetizers. We all know their cheesecake slays the game. Their appetizers are some of the best I've had at any restaurant and they are large in portion size. The avocado egg rolls and the sauce that comes with them are to die for. And who doesn't love the mac and cheese balls? Ditch the regular menu. You can easily pick an appetizer and just order that as your entree; you'll walk out just as full and you'll probably have spent $10 less per person.  As far as service goes, it's always been decent at this location. This isn't a place I frequent just because of the price outweighing the quality of the food, but I had a gift card and, well, I'm a sucker for a slice of cheesecake the size of my head."
Jeannie A.,"Livonia, MI",192,17,36,4.0,6/14/2017,"Just had dessert to go. I went in on a weekday at 4:30pm and it wasn't packed. The cashier was kind and patient and gave me great advice. Their chocolate cake in the display fridge is definitely worth trying. It's rich, but it'll definitely satisfy that craving. Can't speak for the rest of the food and service though (hence the lack of a star)"
Jennifer D.,"Mustang, OK",1,10,4,4.0,10/21/2017,Excellent cheesecake!!! So many varieties to choose from to include low carb options and gluten free options as well as sweetened with Splenda option. Something for everyone! You are able to be seethed for dining or grab and go cheesecake. Friendly service. Clean and fun atmosphere.
Mohamed H.,"Edmond, OK",0,35,100,4.0,5/15/2017,"We come here regularly every 2-3 weeks. I always order the Grilled Ribeye steak, never disappointed. Kids also love their chicken straps but my wife is not that big of a fan. I took one star off because I always run out of my Raspberry lemonade and seems like they try not to refill more than 3 times :("
John S.,"Edmond, OK",0,93,14,5.0,5/4/2017,"The lunch we had today was excellent as was the  service.  They have a skinny menu which was interesting.  I had the skinny beef medallions with mashed potatoes, asparagus, and tomatoes.  It was excellent.  My wife had the skinny asian salad which she sail was excellent."
Caleb W.,"Oklahoma City, OK",0,2,,5.0,12/30/2017,"My wife and I LOVE this restaurant! I wish I could give it a sixth star. Some of the best food in the metro can be found right here without the exorbitant prices you might find at some of the other local restaurants. Here you can expect high quality food with the ""fine dining"" experience without paying fine dining prices. While the lines might be long at prime times without a reservation, the service is always fantastic and the food and drinks leave nothing to be desired. If you want a slice of some of the best cheesecake in the world then get ready for it! Cheesecake Factory has an entire menu of flavors to choose from and we are convinced that there isn't a bad one to be had! Brunch is served Saturday and Sunday from 10:00am - 2:00pm. We can personally attest that the chicken and waffles are incredible, and on a warm day you can enjoy your meal on their patio if you choose. I hope you give them a try. I'm sure you will not be disappointed."
Ginger S.,"Atoka, OK",55,3,3,5.0,5/28/2017,Having lots if fun eating good food with the best little hillbilly I know. Good family time.
Sandy N.,"Oklahoma City, OK",189,69,685,5.0,3/20/2017,"Today we had Kane help us today. He was a great worker and he answered all our questions in a professional and genuine way! Because the weather beautiful out, we sat outside and we def enjoyed the few. With both had some mojitos for lunch: pineapple and passion fruit mojitos! Both is a must! I actually enjoy the passion fruit mojito a bit more then the pineapple bit both are delicious. For appetizers, we had calamari which is WORTH IT! best calamari I've tried (although cheevers, sushi Neko, and red rock are amazing). For our main, my boyfriend had the shrimp and chicken stir fry with brown rice and I had the chicken and mushroom pasta. Both was a specialty dish and both were delicious! The menu was HUGE so we will have to come back and try the rest of the menu. I was not disappointed at all about today! It was amazing! Thank you Kane for your service today!! I hope I spelled ur name right lol"
Betty P.,"Oklahoma City, OK",37,1,,2.0,9/5/2017,"Service was terrible! We waited for a long time before being greeted by our server. He was at the bar getting drinks for the group of 4 girls sitting next to us. They dropped the ""F bomb"" like it was the only word they knew! Thankfully my granddaughter wasn't paying much attention to them! Took a very long time to get our drinks. Dinner arrived about 1 1/2 minutes after appetizer. So we barely touched it. The server boxed our leftovers to go. He failed! He didn't put any of the sauces on the leftovers. We ordered cheesecake's to go. We got our check, paid our check and then sat there for 12 minutes waiting for our cheesecake. We eat here quite often. Food is always great! The last few times we've been we've had bad service!!!"
Tovan T.,"Oklahoma City, OK",295,65,48,4.0,9/11/2016,"I had a pretty good experience here. Went there for a birthday. They don't take reservations and you have to be sure that pretty much all of your party is there before they will seat you.  For the drinks, I got the bloody mary which was decent. Not the best bloody mary I've had, but it comes with a celery and it was good to go with the meal.  I like that they give you complimentary bread and better. Just the plain small packaged butter. But I really enjoyed the pumpernickel bread! For my main meal, I got the almond crusted salmon salad. They definitely give you a good amount for the price. I was surprised about that. My salmon came on a bed of kale, quinoa, and avacado. It was good, filling, and not heavy on the stomach which is nice!  I also tried the crab hash. It was okay. Again, the portion sizes are decent. But, I didn't really enjoy the potatoes that came along with the dish. It had a weird taste to them.  Overall, the service was good and attentive. Very accommodating to my party of 10, and they even gave the birthday girl a complimentary dessert!  I still have yet to try the cheesecake. Too full. (I know, it's called cheesecake factory and I didn't try the cheesecake..) But, I'll be back to try that because they looked delicious!"
Jack W.,"Edmond, OK",0,9,,2.0,11/1/2016,"I've always enjoyed The Cheesecake Factory.  The menu is extensive and the portions are large.  I've been to several locations around the country and the food is usually pretty good with the exception of the pizza I had at the location in San Francisco.  That pizza was some of the worst I've ever tasted, in fact, so bad that I actually sent it back and requested another entree. Here are my two issues with this restaurant: 1.   They do not have a traditional New York cheesecake with a firm, dense texture as opposed to more of a pudding like texture.  Very strange indeed. 2.  And, most important to me.  Why do they put the silverware directly on the tables?  That is simply gross.  Interestingly enough, they wrap the eating utensils in a cloth napkin for the outside tables, but do not do so for indoor dining and it just sits on the table itself.  Even IHOP or Denny's will place the eating utensils on paper placemats. I have mentioned this issue to my servers and have even written a comment on their website.  They all say they wipe the tables down, but have you noticed that they use the same wet rag at each table?  I've seen way too many kids and adults putting their hands and arms all over the tables after they cough and sneeze and then, after the table is cleared with this soiled, wet rag, down go the eating utensils for the next party.  It's just not very appetizing.   I can't believe I'm the only patron that has noticed this disgusting practice.  I always request they bring me the ""wrapped"" set of utensils which they do without any protest.  Nevertheless, the practice is a black eye on a mostly decent restaurant if not for this one issue.   To me, until the management resolves this issue, the restaurant only deserves two stars."
Cory B.,"TX, TX",53,4,1,1.0,11/5/2017,"If I could give it a 0 Star I would. I ordered the four cheese pasta, and the spinach dip. Not only was it overly priced but it was terribly cooked and tasted so bland I had to dump salty on it to even taste anything and to top it all off I've been sick ever since I ate it vomiting multiple times."
Matt M.,"Oklahoma City, OK",430,1101,252,4.0,11/30/2016,"Friendly service. Expect lines and crowds most evenings. (Hey, but that's a good sign, right?) HUGE portions. (I always end up taking food home -- ALWAYS.) High quality ingredients."
Ronna D.,"Vernon, TX",0,2,2,5.0,8/8/2017,"Last year I ate here and it was very good. The chicken was roasted well and my cousin ordered The Mac and cheese burger and she thought it was good. They were very accommodating to special request. In the words of my cousins ""The lemonade is very fancy and this place is cool, awesome, and amazing."""
Heidi W.,"Oklahoma City, OK",323,528,730,3.0,10/4/2016,"There are two ways I enjoy eating at the Cheesecake Factory: -Take out for lunch -Coming late at night and Eating All of the Cheesecakes. Me and my coworkers have made the same mistake over and over of thinking we can come here on our lunch break and not receive terrible service and wait for hours for food and then the check.  But we like cheesecake. And possibly 2 out of the 358 entree items on the menu. (Okay, I exaggerate, there is like 100. Or maybe 200.) I just don't see how a kitchen can properly execute each dish perfectly if there are 1000s of dishes they need to know. I am highly suspect that the ingredients are not fresh.  But I digress. Calling way ahead of time, coming and picking up the order- this has seemed to work just fine.  Also, after going out for the night, coming to the Cheesecake Factory at the end of the night always seems like a good idea. It usually is. It usually includes delicious cheesecake and more drinks and so-so service."
