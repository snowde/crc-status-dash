Annie D.,"Honolulu, HI",6,9,,3.0,9/7/2015,"Ever have a waiter that really went out of his/her way to make you feel like you were inconveniencing them?  I asked our waiter, John M. if we could have a booth instead because my friend's chair was uncomfortable.  If looks could kill!  That dude was practically seething the rest of the evening and not even hiding it.  Very sarcastic.  On a positive note the was good but it took a little longer than average for entrée."
Ellison D.,"Oklahoma City, OK",33,17,2,2.0,8/18/2013,"The menu is massive, with lots of choices, even for vegetarians. Discovering that I had more than one option was the best part of our visit. The service was just awful. The waitress was super dismissive and kept looking everywhere but at us while she was taking our order. We had to ask her repeatedly for basic things like silverware, bread plates, napkins, and sugar. Once we got our food, she didn't come back; we had to flag down someone for our check. This was annoying, but the worst part of our visit was undoubtedly the food. I had the veggie burger. It fell apart pretty much immediately and the flavor was kind of weirdly sweet. My kids had mac and cheese and bowtie alfredo; both were undercooked with watery sauce.  I might go to Cheesecake Factory again if I had a gift card, but not if I was paying for it. It was really mediocre."
Karen H.,"Oklahoma City, OK",0,4,,5.0,8/17/2015,"The best restaurant. They never dissapoint. This place is clean and the waiters are very friendly. Im in this place once a week and orders either miso salmon or shrimp scampi, all these years I have ate in this place, I have never once had bad service. This is my go to place to eat."
Mary M.,"Oklahoma City, OK",0,11,,1.0,8/8/2015,"Been to many cheesecake factories, love them. However, at 11:30 on Saturday we were seated at a long row of tables very close seating. I do not want to eat within 1-2 ft of a stranger. I asked if we could sit somewhere more private. The hostess looked at me like she did not  understand me. I repeated it. She said no booths available. I said ok. Manager came over and asked if we wanted to wait on a booth, I said no Just did not want anyone next to me. He said he was going to fill up the restaurant (of course). I felt that he he came over to let me know that he did not need my business so we left. Made me soooo sad."
Michael F.,"Edmond, OK",10,149,47,5.0,4/22/2015,"Love this place food is always amazing service is almost always perfect.. this last time I requested another shot un my drink. It was really weak. The server told me I wasnt going to taste the alcohol.. I simply asked her for another shot, after I told her I didnt want to see her anymore I got a new server and my simple request was fulfilled... I will be back often not to let one bad server kill the awesome atmosphere here.."
Nicole P.,"Norman, OK",69,53,52,2.0,4/7/2013,"I usually try to stay away from chain restaurants because I think the food lacks the extra love and attention needed to make a good meal, but I had a $40 gift card to The Cheesecake Factory and I needed to go to Penn Square Mall anyway. My experience today reconfirmed (for the hundredth or so time) my distrust of chains. Let me start with the good news - the cheesecake at The Cheesecake Factory is amazing. Every dessert I've ever had from here has been consistently, sinfully delicious. They have a huge variety of cheesecakes to choose from and the display is enough to make my mouth water. I've tried several different kinds, but my favorite is the simple classic cheesecake with strawberries and whip cream. I know they get all of their desserts shipped in. Nothing is made in-house. This is usually a big food turn-off for me, but the deliciousness of the cheesecakes wins me over. I love it! Even though you're looking at around $7 a slice, I think it's totally worth it. I can't say the same about the non-bakery items. Ok, so I will say the complimentary sourdough and dark honey-wheat bread they serve is great. I was really hungry when we got there and happy to find out I didn't have to wait for our food to get a little nibble in. However, after the bread, my meal went way downhill. I ordered scrambled eggs with potatoes and a bagel with cream cheese. The eggs looked and tasted like edible plastic and the potatoes were over-processed and bland-tasting. My favorite thing was the bagel and cream cheese, but even the bagel was burnt a little bit. I really haven't had a good food experience any time I've visited this restaurant and I have come to discover that a ridiculously long menu usually equals blah food as is the case here. Also, although our waitress was sweet and somewhat attentive, I think the servers might be overworked here. Everyone seemed frantic and frazzled. And why do they make them all wear white everything?!? Not a good look for frazzled wait staff in my opinion. I guess the moral of this story is, BREAK THE CHAINS unless you are satisfied with bland food. But do go in and pick up a cheesecake if you're in the area. You won't be disappointed with that."
Sharon M.,"Mesa, AZ",94,243,93,3.0,3/10/2012,"I like Cheesecake Factory every now and again. This CF is exactly like any other CF I've ever been to. Just like the one in SLC and just like the 2 I ate at in AZ before moving here. There is nothing unique about any particular CF, it's a chain restaurant but one that I tend to enjoy for my birthday.  We had a pretty good experience as far as food goes. In fact service and food were all fantastic until my bff said ""It's her birthday"" and not for the obvious ""they're gonna sing and embarass me"" reason. It literally took 20 minutes to get my cheesecake with ""happy birthday to you"" written in chocolate on the plate's rim.  Other than that: I requested pasta with my samlon instead of mashed potatoes. While the request was granted without any fuss the noodles were undercooked and stuck together. The sweet corn tamale cakes though, were so so good!  I'm not a big fan of corporate restaurants. I typically prefer and dine with local companies, just sayin'"
Heather P.,"Norman, OK",67,3,,1.0,4/3/2016,"Found regular pasta in my gluten free pasta. They use the same water and pots for both. I am now vomiting heavily. Manager blamed some lowly pasta guy in the kitchen and said he didn't know. This has been going on for years after reading reviews on ""find me gluten free"" app. Do not say you are celiac friendly if you can't uphold it. We actually get sick. I will never come back and I posted a review on ""find me gluten free"" app. I didn't fight and ask for a free meal and it wasn't free even after they found out it was not good for me.  I paid for it but I didn't eat much of it and I'm now vomiting the rest into the toilet. Thanks for ruining my night Cheesecake Factory."
Danielle M.,"Oklahoma City, OK",9,47,3,2.0,12/27/2014,"I have to jump on the band wagon and ask, what's the big deal about this place? the Orange chicken was def Orange and sweet with no other flavor and the avocado eggrolls were bland. This was strike 2 so I won't be back"
J J.,"Oklahoma City, OK",0,33,,1.0,3/16/2015,"I ate there yesterday and got food poisoning from the fresh salmon. Up all night with green apple two step. Told waitress somethings was funny about the food, she just discounted the statement with offering a substitution."
Rebecca L.,"Midwest City, OK",13,61,105,5.0,2/21/2014,My husband and I almost always come here on a regular Friday night date night. We love LeAnn F. as our server and specifically request for her each week we come. She takes such great care of us. The food here is so great. We have not had one bad meal yet. The wait was over an hour and a half tonight but well worth it. :)
Josie B.,"Oklahoma City, OK",59,2,,1.0,8/2/2014,"Just had my Birthday lunch here, worst visit I have ever had. Waitress disappeared for about 15 minutes. She would say ""Do you need anything else?"" Then not even come back with what I asked for. Food was less than what I have come to know from Cheesecake Factory. My calamari was burnt and all clumped together in a giant ball. Half of which was actually chicken tenders when you started pulling it apart. My appetizer, bread and my meal all came out together. Heaven forbid I ask for a straw. I had to ask for a refill.  Didn't even order the Cheesecake I wanted before I left because I was just over the terrible service."
Caye C.,"Oklahoma City, OK",6,40,24,3.0,7/15/2014,"For all of the hype that this restaurant gets my experience wasn't too bad. We went on a Monday night so, thankfully, there was no wait (which, on the weekends I hear, can be terrible). Our hostess sat my date and I at a tiny, two-person table squeezed in between two full tables. One of the tables was full of very loud teenage girls obsessed with selfies.  Anyways, back to the food. I asked for a water with lemon, pretty basic, but never got a lemon all night even after asking the waiter multiple times. I ordered the shrimp BLT and a side salad. The salad was a good mix of greens with a very yummy, chunky blue cheese dressing. The sandwich was massive! It had thick strips of crispy bacon and large slices of tomato, although the tomato had not fully ripened yet (yay green tomatoes!). There was very little shrimp which was disappointing because let's face it, shrimp is the whole reason for living! Next up, the cheese cake!!! I ordered red velvet cheese cake and my date had the cookie dough. They were both pretty epic. The cookie dough cake has actual cookie dough in the middle! Wow. The red velvet is worth the $10 and it's so huge that I had cheese cake for the next three nights.  All in all, I would recommended this place to someone during a weekday. Nice atmosphere (unless you get placed next to high school girls), friendly staff, and yummy food. A bit pricey but even if you just go for dessert it's worth it."
Rob G.,"Oklahoma City, OK",18,9,,1.0,10/15/2014,"This Cheesecake Factory has, unfortunately, gone downhill lately because of bad management: poor service and food not prepared well!  Go to Whiskey Café around the corner for a much better dining experience."
Ryan L.,"Shawnee, OK",3,2,,5.0,1/23/2015,"Had a great experience here yesterday.  the food was great and our server was amazing. Tall girl I believe her name was Victoria, truly went out of her way to make our order right for us.  Even gave us a great suggestion for desert that I loved. Ask for her if you want a great experience and great food."
Susan D.,"Seaside, CA",605,1122,1076,4.0,10/7/2010,"On rare occasions, I love to over-indulge at the Cheesecake Factory.  So last night, when I was pulling into OKC, OK, and my friend suggested it for dinner, I was all game.  :) This CCF is no different than the others, other than it was a lil less hectic feeling.  It's a huge restaurant that is kept very clean and has beautiful, classic decor.  My friend and I sat at the bar so we could chat, watch the game and enjoy the night away from the restaurant bustle.  The bartender, Kaitlyn, was super cute and nice (just the way my friend likes em) and when our food came out, it was delicious as always.   I like to order the Black Pepper Jamaican Shrimp.  It's a lil spicy and always tasty.  I followed it with a Lemon Raspberry Cheesecake, which will take me 3 days to finish because my friend ordered his own, the pecan pumpkin seasonal cheesecake.  All was good! Thank-u, Cheesecake Factory, for the dependable, tasty food and service! See ya there!"
Sarah S.,"Oklahoma City, OK",10,42,5,1.0,7/11/2014,"Worst atmosphere and tacky decor I have ever seen, it is like Egypt meets grandma. The food is so bland and twice my silver wear has been dirty."
Joe H.,"Jefferson, TX",1,6,,4.0,1/28/2016,This place is very clean and the atmosphere is nice.  Our wait was a little long but we got there right at 6:00.  Waitstaff was very polite and helpful.  The menu is huge and can be a little intimidating when trying to decide.  I would definitely eat here again.
Tim A.,"Oklahoma City, OK",0,7,,5.0,1/21/2016,The Cheesecake Factory is by far the best casual restaurant in Okc. The service is incredible and the food is always great.  They have the best selection and the staff always exceeds all expectations of a restaurant!
Joy C.,"Newcastle, OK",0,2,,5.0,12/8/2014,Favorite place. So many choices. All the deserts are great. Everything tastes fresh and service also usually great.
