Juliette L.,"Oklahoma City, OK",275,335,181,2.0,12/5/2012,"I wanted to do an update for this chain. I went here recently again after shopping with my husband. My husband had the carbonara which he said was not carbonara and did not taste good. I had the lettuce wraps which they didn't even bring out to me until ten mins after my husband got his meal. The manager however did apologize and asked me if I wanted a soup or salad while I waited, but I declined. Anywho.. my lettuce wraps only had one tiny piece of chicken, and was not satisfying. The cheesecakes however have always tasted yummy. I usually get the Godiva, yum. Bottom line is dine some place else and get dessert to-go here."
Brian W.,"Huntington Beach, CA",2,43,47,5.0,4/29/2013,"Fast service, great food, great environment, great attitudes, just a pleasant experience. 5 stars."
Hannah R.,"Lubbock, TX",1,65,,4.0,8/29/2014,"Love love love the Cheesecake Factory. We did have quite the long wait, but considering it was Friday night at dinner time I can't complain too much. Our waitress was prompt in taking drink orders, and gave us plenty of time to look over the ridiculously long menu. Seriously, it's 15 pages. We ordered our food and only waited 20-30 minutes on a busy night, which is just fine for me- I filled up on some sourdough and pumpernickel bread. My boyfriend and his dad had crab cakes and loved them. Really, they raved about them for days. I had a burger which was nothing special but a good burger nonetheless. Then we all shared Tex Mex egg rolls. Man oh man, I wish I could eat those every day. I love those things!"
Steve R.,"Shawnee, OK",368,211,39,3.0,6/24/2012,"Their food and gigantic menu are consistent with all the other Cheesecake Factories around the country. Even though the outdoor seating areas overlook the beautiful mall parking lots, they do try to make it as nice as possible. I'm probably in the minority of diners here because we never get dessert, but their cheesecakes look amazing."
Addison G.,"Oklahoma City, OK",147,108,8,2.0,7/14/2012,Typical chain. Nothing special. The food is decent. The portions are HUGE! The service can be hit or miss. You'll either get someone who goes above and beyond or someone who forgets you're there.  The best thing here is the cheesecake obviously.
Annie C.,"Norman, OK",13,60,13,4.0,4/1/2014,"This place is pretty good for a chain restaurant.  I went there for a late lunch and was seated quickly.  I ordered the pasta carbonara and it was very good.  My dining companion order the herb-encrusted salmon and he said it was good, as well.  We also got dessert--kahlua coffee cocoa cheesecake (or something like that) and THAT was amazing!  I love the huge menu here, I always feel like I have lots of options.  The negative, though, is the ambiance.  It's always really loud in here.  Get a booth if you can, as it's generally quieter."
Charlie A.,"Gulf Breeze, FL",7,67,19,4.0,6/21/2014,I sat at the bar and enjoyed watching the Thunder in the playoffs.  I had a cold beer and enjoyed tasty pot stickers as my appetizer.  The service at the bar was excellent.
Dustin R.,"Lawton, OK",1,71,63,3.0,1/1/2014,I don't get the hype. It was OK. Pricey IMO. I ordered a sandwich and it wasn't very big width wise but was stacked so high I barely could take a bite which I hate! A slightly bigger bread would make it easier to eat. I had a slice of cheese cake which was tasty but nothing amazing.
Ali W.,"Piedmont, OK",90,3,1,2.0,12/19/2013,"Over worked chain.  They lost our reservation, then told us they don't take them.  We did get free dips, but they weren't the highlight of our experience.  Service is always questionable here and I've only been 3-4 times in my life.  Half our table received their food in 15 minutes and the other half it took almost 40 minutes for some soup and salad. They also added gratuity  - which I hate - we are extremely generous tippers, until you add gratuity.  Everyone always seems like they're running around like crazy and are flustered. Not an enjoyable dining experience."
Haley H.,"Kansas City, MO",1,38,1,5.0,3/28/2015,"Amazing! Great food every time we come in and employees are always clean cut. It is a little pricey, but the food is incredible and portions are huge. And I can never leave without cheesecakes!"
Mike C.,"Fort Sill, OK",159,149,60,4.0,3/3/2014,"I love this place, they never disappoint! If you havent tried the ahi tar tare you're missing out. It is so incredible! Tuxedo cheesecake for me as well!"
Mac B.,"Sioux Falls, SD",0,55,8,3.0,6/25/2011,"We have eaten here many times in a number of states. Big menu. Plenty to choose from. Interior is visually interesting. Wait staff has always been good.  Yes, it is a chain. But their business plan works. And if you like cheesecake, there is plenty to choose from on that front as well as other desserts. The wait on weekends can be crazy. So plan ahead. Usually things slow down by 8:30 if you don't mind eating later. The only complaint I have is that some of the tables are set up very close to each other. And if it is busy, you kind of feel like you are wedged in there with the masses. Not exactly quaint and cozy if you happen to be seated in that section."
Casey P.,"Norman, OK",5,11,1,3.0,11/17/2010,"Yeah, I know people love this place, but I think its kind of overrated. And overpriced. The portions are enormous and after paying close to $20 for an entree you feel kind of obliged to take your little doggy bag back home and try and get a second meal out of it. Admittedly I did go out drinking later that night and it made for some decent 3am munchies. Look I don't mind paying good money for a meal thats going to knock my socks off but I didn't find that here.  Decent cocktails but again more than I really like to pay when I'm at a chain restaurant devoid of any kind of atmosphere. Good cheesecake but honestly... I think I've had better."
Trenton G.,"Oklahoma City, OK",0,1,,5.0,2/19/2014,Went here for Valentine's day and had a great experience! The waitress took tremendous care of my table. The food was perfectly cooked and arrived extremely quick especially considering how busy the restaurant was. My recommendation would be to try the Oreo cheesecake for dessert! It was absolutely amazing!
Micah C.,"Oklahoma City, OK",26,69,50,4.0,10/14/2013,Love the new fish tacos! My fav cheesecake is the red velvet.  Service was okay. Our waitresa was anxious to clean the table of things I often wasn't finished eating. Overall a good place for our date!
Niki S.,"Murphy, TX",31,208,,3.0,12/1/2012,"Sometimes a corporate chain place is exactly what you need.  If you are going out to eat with a group that has varying tastes, it's nice to take out the mystery element.  I like The Cheesecake Factory because I know what to expect.  The atmosphere is a little more upscale than your average family restaurant.  Casual enough to be relaxed but just fancy enough to celebrate a birthday or anniversary.     This location is free standing but next to a large shopping mall.  The menu is extensive so definitely email out a link to the indecisive.  I do like that you can order a lunch special on the weekends.  The portions are still gigantic and their warm bread basket is addictive.  I usually skip appetizers in an attempt to save room for cheesecake but the avocado rolls are really good.  Imagine a mix between guacamole and eggs rolls- the best of both worlds.     Besides cheesecake, the reason I go to CF is for pasta.  I feel a little less guilty splurging on a bowl of the Fettuccine with Chicken and Sun Dried Tomatoes when I know I am just minutes away from chasing it with a cheesecake induced sugar rush.  I like to get all my sinning done in one sitting.  My sweety likes the steak and eggs on the brunch menu.    They do offer a Skinnylicious menu if you want lighter fare but that just seems like a way to make your table mates feel bad about themselves. Do you want to be ""that"" guy or girl?   The service was good even though we went during the Sunday brunch rush.  The one thing I would suggest is to ask to keep one menu as that table to browse the cheesecake flavors.  My favorites are the Key Lime, Lemon Raspberry and White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle.  Don't plan anything too ambitious for about 4 hours after a trip to the Cheesecake Factory- usually a nap while watching TV will help you through the food fog."
K G.,"Elgin, OK",0,60,14,5.0,5/17/2014,I love the Vietnamese Spring Rolls! Santorini Farro Salad is my next favorite.  I've never been disappointed. Waiters always attentive. Hubby loves the filet mignon. It's cooked to perfection every time.
Greg S.,"Oologah, OK",7,41,35,5.0,7/27/2009,"I'm not gonna lie, this place rocks! I love eating at The Factory! I've eaten at this one twice. The first time I ate dinner and dessert...Chicken Parmesan with a mocha cheese cake slice afterwards. A-MAZ-ING! So good! And the wait staff was great. That time I went with some friends and our waitress was pregnant and about to pop at any time. She did so good for being so pregnant that we left and went to Wal-Mart and bought her some baby clothes and diapers and formula and stuff! She cried! It was great! The Second time, I went with a group of friends and we had dessert on the patio. So beautiful! The bathrooms are very very nice. The inside is so nice and the place itself is just great. No negatives from me. I highly recommend The Cheese Cake Factory."
Karen S.,"Frederick, OK",26,44,9,4.0,3/16/2014,"It is the Cheesecake Factory. I had the grilled eggplant and roasted red pepper sandwich.Phenomenal. My son had the mac and cheese burger. Fantastic. His girlfriend had the buffalo chicken sandwich and my husband had the factory burger. They both enjoyed theirs. The appetizers were yummy as well-firecracker salmon and the artichoke and spinach cheese dip. What is worth mentioning here is the manner in which we were treated. I have been here many times as it is the only Factory within a bazillion miles. It is ALWAYS crowded. This is not a problem for me. I am fully prepared to wait. However, I do not appreciate being rushed. If one is going to spend a hundred bucks for a meal, I think the option of at least wiping your mouth after the last bite should be open to you. We had barely laid our forks down before the bill was received and plates were whisked away.  I don't appreciated being pressured to leave because the Factory failed to build a big enough building. Of course our waitress got our generous tip-I don't like not paying- just give us a chance to take a breath before you decide it is time for us to leave."
S S.,"Sumter, SC",115,502,583,4.0,7/27/2009,"Why are you guys hating on the factory?  I like this place.  We came here in a group of 8 to celebrate our right to gluttony.   We were seated quickly on the patio, and ordered away.   Shortly after sitting down, I took a walk to the restroom.  With each step, I found myself gasping as I stared at everyone's table.  An 11-lb burger, is that necessary?  A 5-gallon bucket of pasta?  That has to be at least two servings. We all ordered a single slice of cake.  Ridiculous.  Absolutely ridiculous.  The cake reminds me of World IV on Super Mario Brothers, where everything is huge, but you're still small.   We took the $8 slice of chocolate cheesecake back home with us, and had it for breakfast, lunch, and dinner the next day. Great place for groups.  Go outside if you can."
