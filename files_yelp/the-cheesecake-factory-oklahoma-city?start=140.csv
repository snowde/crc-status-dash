Lori A.,"Fort Worth, TX",2,59,4,3.0,1/1/2013,"Not great. Not bad. Just food. I have had good experiences at other ccf restaurants. This one was a let down. Also, got sick after eating here, possibly a touch of food poisoning!"
Jamie B.,"Oklahoma City, OK",0,1,,5.0,3/23/2012,"We went here while on a business trip in OKC.  We had to wait a bit for a table as it was a really busy evening.  It was definitely worth the wait.  Food was incredible, cheesecake was delicious, and our server (Nick, I think) was very friendly, knowledgable, and took good care of us.   I will definitely come here the next time I have to travel to OKC."
Amanda E.,"Oklahoma City, OK",2,122,15,2.0,6/11/2007,"I'll probably get hate mail for giving Cheesecake Factory a two star review since the gargantuan portions guarantee a perpetual crowd but who wants hubcap-sized plates of mediocre food? Seriously, I'd rather have a small dish of something that tastes divine than a trough of something that tastes like packing peanuts. I also wonder if there's a Bread Nazi in the kitchen rationing the bread baskets since it seems like bread delivery is random and/or tables worthy of bread are chosen on a lottery system. Service is also a little spotty- wait staff is always pleasant but there seems to be a lack of communication regarding seating since servers seem befuddled at first by your appearance in their section. The avocado spring rolls are usually good (hence the two stars) but not good enough for me to return if I've got other dining options (or even an unopened can of soup at home)."
John S.,"Oklahoma City, OK",20,138,29,3.0,1/8/2010,"I don't want to admit that I went here, but I stopped by last night for dinner with some friends. The wait staff was extremely courteous, especially because we fell into the auto 18% gratuity. The menu was huge and took hours to go through. I had a caramel apple cider that was like warm apple pie in a glass. I followed that up with a large house salad and split a vegetable penne. The pasta was cooked perfectly, but the vegetables were bland and over done. Overall I had a pleasant experience and would come back."
Josh W.,"Chandler, AZ",109,13,1,5.0,10/19/2009,"This place has the largest menu of any restaurant with all types of food to please anyone's palate. Start out with the Ahi Carpaccio or the Crab Cakes, then move right into the Bistro Shrimp Pasta, California Cheesesteak Sandwich or the Fresh Grilled Mahi Mahi and finish it off with the Tiramisu cheesecake or the Dulce de Leche Caramel cheesecake, both are to die for!"
Vivian H.,"San Francisco, CA",297,329,639,2.0,7/10/2008,"Another overrated chain restaurant. Atmosphere and food were mediocre. Save your money, and go across the parking lot to Elephant bar instead."
Mimi W.,"Oklahoma City, OK",0,14,1,3.0,2/9/2011,"It's good but pricey.. but then again, the portions are gargantuan. i'll go back here for special occasions, but that's about it."
That Gal F.,"Austin, TX",0,3,,3.0,3/25/2009,"I generally enjoy a factory of cheescakes, but on this occassion I found it mind-numbingly exhaustive.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but the waiter is supposed to do the work, not the patron, no?  I'm guessing our waiter is new to Cheesecake Factory, if not to waiting tables in general, if not new to the world.   Perhaps he spent too much time under the California sun as that's the only menial bit of ""conversation"" I was able to concentrate on before I started gauging my eyeballs in an attempt to remove them from their sockets and shove them in my ears.  How many times are you going to ask me if I wanted meatballs with my spaghetti after I repeatedly ordered alfredo and finally gave up and settled on mushroom ravioli...hold the meatballs.  And if I wanted to be corrected on my pronunciation of ""Bruschetta"", which I still maintain has a soft shhh sound to it, I'd consult the Oxford dictionary as opposed to being auditorially accosted with the cacoughanous ear beating of the confirmation that I wanted to start with ""Brewsketta"".  The food was palatable, though hardly worth the wait.  Until Mr. Sweet Valley High is more experienced or no longer employed here I doubt I'll be willing to roll the dice with this place again.  All together now, when I say Mali, y'all say boo."
