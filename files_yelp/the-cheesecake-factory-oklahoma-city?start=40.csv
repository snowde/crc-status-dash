Darin S.,"Del City, OK",4,41,106,4.0,11/30/2016,This review is for lunch. Had a great Cobb salad and my date had a very fresh grilled salmon. Service was good and attentive. The deep chocolate cake we split had very fresh whipped cream on the side and was way more than the two of us could eat. Price was a little higher than average but not overwhelming. No iceberg lettuce in my salad and plenty of grilled chicken and bacon.
Eddie H.,"Tulsa, OK",23,101,313,3.0,11/4/2015,"My first visit to a cheesecake factory was a cloudy fall evening.  I ordered The Bacon Bacon Cheeseburger. It came with fries.  I nibbled on the bread they brought to the table while I waited.  The dark wheat bread had a soft but chewy texture with caramel notes that left a smoky after taste.  It seemed a shame to relegate it to pre-dinner munching.  it is worth a starring role.  The white bread was far chewier and crunchy with a glutinous texture that spoke of peasant roots and hinted at a missed calling to the status of crouton makings. The atmosphere was upscale but noisy with dim lighting that went for intimate but achieved an open crowded vibe. The burger arrived. I opted for mayo in lieu of the tartar sauce like not so ""special sauce."" The bun was soft but we'll toasted. it was high class enough to hang out in a joint like this but down to earth enough to be a proper hamburger bun. The beef was soft but pallid. Light on beefy flavor The patty left most of the flavor to the bacon. The Bacon itself was charred past the point of crispy and tasted only a moment from being burned. The cheese was delightfully creamy and gave quiet support to the rest of the burger The fries were lightly golden brown and delicious... They were right out of a dictionary definition of American French fries. My overall opinion is tentative worth ordering again if you""'re comming here with friends and want a burger instead of something else.  If I ever come back I will explore the menu for something else. I took home a piece of Strawberry Cheesecake (It didn't seem right not to try the cheesecake at a place called The Cheesecake Factory. The filling was mildly tangy with a modified creamy taste. The crust was slightly soggy with a grainy texture and pleasant molasses undertone to the graham cracker crust. It was a rather good commercial version of the Italian inspired desert."
J M.,"Clovis, NM",5,219,277,4.0,12/23/2016,Firecracker salmon for an appetizer was da bomb! Daughter ordered grilled salmon..bland tasting. She didnt finish. I ordered from skinnyliousious menu of shrimp pasta. I finished my plate. Angel pasta was a tad undercooked..but edible. Got the strawberry cheesecake. Service was good and attentive.
Randi P.,"Oklahoma City, OK",70,69,47,5.0,8/16/2016,"This place has never let me down. I've been dining here at Cheesecake Factory since they opened in Beverly Hills, California. This is my go to place whenever I get out of church late and don't want to deal with the ""CHURCH RUSH"". I only wait about 10-15mins. They have the best drinks (Strawberry or Raspberry Lemonade). With a menu that is over 10 pages long you won't have a problem finding something you like or want to try for the first time.   My Favorite Things: Meatloaf Cashew Chicken (hold cashews w/Mashed potatoes) Miso Salmon Chinese Chicken Salad Kobe Burger Grilled Chicken Avocado Bacon Sandwich Bang Bang Chicken White Bean Chili Avocado Eggrolls Buffalo Blasts Cobb Salad         -----------------------Let me stop there cause I could keep going------------------------- The staff are extremely nice from the greeters to the bussers. We always have GREAT times here!!!!"
Maria G.,"Arlington, TX",150,2,1,5.0,12/23/2016,"After a long day at work and a whole lot of Christmas shopping, ended our evening at The Cheesecake Factory! Amazing cocktails, food, and service!"
Melanie S.,"Oklahoma City, OK",39,98,23,4.0,4/22/2016,"This is a pretty solid chain restaurant. We come here only probably about 3-4 times a year, but it is always really good. We visited a few weeks ago, and I got the Thai salmon and I had no complaints. It was cooked really well and the sauce on it was really good. This place has everything (literally almost everything) on their menu; it's THE biggest menu I've ever laid eyes on!  I deduct a star for the atmosphere. This is a very large place, and it gets pretty loud inside. Although, I will say they do have a patio outside that I have never sat at.  Other than that, this is a definite ""go-to"" for Cheesecake (obvious reasons). The Oreo cheesecake is my favorite-- it's pretty much like heaven in your mouth."
Jessy I.,"Woodland Hills, CA",167,163,49,4.0,9/10/2016,"Great service, great food! We usually get the salmon and it's amazing here...the mashed potatoes really good too. The bread is always warm and makes my carb loving soul happy. If you choose to end your dinner with cheesecake you won't be disappointed!"
Imxal P.,"Norman, OK",24,1,,1.0,6/16/2017,"So disappointed with their meal serving and quality. House nacho with chicken had no chicken on top. With 15 dollar appetizers, burned chips and cold melted cheese on top was really disappointing. On top of that our entree, which was chicken serve with white or brown rice, had table spoon of rice in middle of chicken curry.. It's looks like rice spice like side for big bowl of chicken curry.. it's not worth the money.. do not recommend any friends except dessert."
Diana T.,"Lawton, OK",37,6,1,1.0,5/24/2017,"I've been to this cheesecake factory before and the service was fine. I went back today and our server was rude. We had an older server at first but for some reason she was replaced by Sydney S. after our original server took our orders. The original server put in the wrong salad for my friend so we didn't blame Sydney for it. The food was good but nothing spectacular. I ended up sharing the lemoncello cream torte for dessert. The mascarpone was beyond bitter so I asked Sydney if that was how it was supposed to taste and she said yes. I'm pretty sure something was wrong with the cake but she made me believe that the mascarpone  was meant to be bitter beyond belief. She saw that I was displeased by it and asked if I wanted something else but before I could answer, she walked off. I don't think she was too happy with the fact that she had to take our table but that didn't give her an excuse to be rude. Before this visit we were deciding between Whiskey Cake or Cheesecake factory, we should've went with Whiskey Cake as their food is better."
Maximilian B.,"Oklahoma City, OK",7,64,21,4.0,4/12/2017,"Went there for lunch with parent. The food was excellent. She had the chicken sandwich. I had the pasta with ship and mushroom. The only complaint is the salad I order was dry and no dressing, I had to Oder extra ranch. The other thing is the salad waitress was so. Other table got their food before ours, when we order first."
Seung Eun C.,"Los Angeles, CA",460,860,1090,4.0,12/11/2015,"No matter which city or state, Cheesecake is always consistent for sure! Dining solo at the bar, Andrew my server was amazzzing!  Such a nice guy with an awesome attitude and he was very pleasant.  He was very patient while I was conducting some business on my smart phone =) My favorite appetizer is the avocado eggroll and it was spot on delicious.  I don't know why I like it so much - it's just fried avocados, but it's just a staple everytime I eat at CF. The burger was delicious.  No complaints! I think CF is one of the best chain restaurants in the US.  The extensive menu has something for everyone, the portions are huge, prices affordable, and always has a nice ambience. It's always a nice option when traveling."
James C.,"Oklahoma City, OK",447,54,50,5.0,6/13/2016,"I honestly was pleasantly surprised by the food here.  We got Lettuce wraps to start. They were really good, and the presentation was really nice as well.  For my main course, I ordered the ribeye. To my surprise they cooked it properly and it was actually really juicy. The dessert I got it what was the most memorable. We got this mango lime cake that I could not get enough of. I could honestly eat a whole cake of these bad boys. The service was also really good!  I definitely recommend checking this place out."
Laura B.,"Yukon, OK",136,95,32,4.0,9/5/2015,"I love Cheesecake Factory. I also appreciate that they are all pretty consistent. If you've been to one Cheesecake Factory, you've pretty much been to them all. Huge menu, huge portions, huge gap in your wallet... but the same delicious food, strong drinks, and good service that you know and love. This is the first one I've been to where our party of 5 was immediately seated on a Friday night. I was totally expecting to wait at least an hour. I'm not sure if that's normal, but I'm not complaining!"
Emily B.,"Central Oklahoma City, Oklahoma City, OK",73,23,,4.0,2/20/2017,"Cheesecake Factory is known for its cheesecake obviously. I always love my cheesecake from there. Especially since we are located in OKC, it's nice to have great cheesecake available. The food is okay, but I mainly go for the tasty cheesecake."
Mekaw87 ..,"Edmond, OK",0,1,,1.0,7/23/2017,"I believe that Yelp should adopt a negative star capability...  just a suggestion. That being said I typically never post anything to a websites comments that can be viewed as disfavorable because I feel like any restaurant can have an off night. However, when the staff is less than helpful when food is brought to the table frozen in the middle for one member of my party, and the plates are completely cold for myself and two others, an apology and a replacement entrée  is all that is needed. When are our server finally brought the two replacement chicken Bellagio's after waiting an additional hour it was completely drenched in oil. Now being that I waited two hours to eat I went ahead and had a few bites despite the egregious service that I received, only to be made physically sick due to all the oil that in my opinion was given out of spite. I spoke with 2 managers that did not acknowledge the cold food. One person in our party never received their original order, and they received the replacement entrée that was frozen in the middle. No one apologized or an the original entrée that was offered never made it to the table.  There was not any acknowledgement for the lack of food service by our waiter as well.  I will not be visiting this location ever again. There are a lot of options in Oklahoma City that far surpass this culinary experience and receiving bad service at a major chain, i.e. (The Cheesecake Factory)  is not worth the time or money. I hope other people have a better experience at this location because frankly mine was deplorable."
Mark C.,"Edmond, OK",0,77,,3.0,1/22/2017,"Having never been to one of these, we finally went for a Sunday lunch. The restaurant was about 3/4 full and wait was about 20 minutes.   Service was pretty good for our party of 6. Maybe I was expecting too much but I found the food only fair and about average for a chain restaurant. Had asked for a bread refill when entrees came but we never got it. Meal took an additional 20 - 25 minutes to get to us.    Had some of the cheesecakes for dessert.. Again, they were ok but nothing I found exceptional.   I found on the bill that soft drinks were $3, lemonade $4 and regular coffee was also $3. Average food and unexceptional desserts, even if a bit overpriced based on ingredient, quality and taste are something I can live with. But such over pricing on beverages is a deal breaker for me and tipped the scales.   Overall, it was merely an acceptable experience but the value and experience for $150 just wasn't there to warrant a return trip."
Quinten C.,"Oklahoma City, OK",13,2,,1.0,6/27/2015,"Here is a restaurant that cares little for guest satisfaction and even less for how they treat their employee. As long as the General manager, Rick is piling in people he could care less how your food tastes or how long it takes to get to you. However the biggest issue here, is Steve the Executive Kitchen Manager, a man who truly loves to hide a good sexual harassment ordeal, or an underpaid employee having to miss work because they cannot pay to wash their uniform until the next day. But don't worry even if the uniform is covered in cat urine, this man will say it's ""cool just come to work"".  I could list a million reasons why not to eat here at this particular restaurant but the biggest of all is the unsanitary practice of cooks in the back, from going to the bathroom, and right back to cooking missing the sink. To dropping food on the floor and throwing back up on your plate.  Do not support this restaurant or the horrible people who run it. There is plenty food in Oklahoma City with class, playing style, affordability and of course, taste that isn't chain oriented."
Gloria R.,"Oklahoma City, OK",13,74,82,2.0,2/21/2015,"I've been waiting for an hour! With five kids and four adults. The manager is making excuses and told us that our table was almost ready, instead they gave that table away. Then he avoids eye contact. Bad news is that I am hungry. Part 2---we waited 1hr 15 minutes. Like I said we had a bunch of kids and didn't want to pile them back in the car. I asked the manager, ""can you explain how these women got seated before us?"" He stated, ""they checked in before you."" I had seen these folks walk in and check in. I told him, ""no they did not.""  We got Joe as a waiter and he was awesome! I told him that we wanted to order for the kids and he brought food and drinks for the kids right away. We did not wait too long to eat and the food was nice and warm.    Now, we never got an apology or even acknowledgement that we got screwed from the manager. Nothing. I'm actually grateful that didn't have to see him. It would be nice if they took call ahead seating and I understand it takes a while to seat. Large group, but when others come and get served before you on more than one occasion; it really ticks you off. When the management is indifferent to your children's needs it really really is inexcusable. Corporate will hear about this."
Buzz M.,"Copperas Cove, TX",0,8,,5.0,6/20/2017,This place was great. I really like the food and the service was accurate and delivered in a timely manner.
April C.,"Oklahoma City, OK",46,51,107,4.0,7/17/2015,"Absolutely superb miso salmon.  I have had a hard time exploring other dishes because of my addiction with this entree.  It's sweet and savory on a bed of rice with asparagus.  The salmon is cooked perfectly with a crispy caramelized outside.  Total love!!!!  I recently tried some other dishes including the combination of shrimp scampi and salmon with lemon sauce.  I usually love scampi but the salmon again was the better half of this dish with an outstanding lemon sauce.  It wasn't too tart, having the right amount of citrus which melded perfect with the creamy sauce.   We also tried the salmon salad.  This is a great salad if you like mustard.  It was nice and fresh and addicting.   For appetizers, I highly recommend the fried calamari.  The breading wasn't too much and it wasn't overlooked or oily like other places.  They nailed it in my opinion.  It comes with a cocktail sauce and an amazing tarter sauce that had a great garlic kick.  Perhaps the best tartar sauce I've ever had.  The asparagus crab dip was so so for me.  It was a bit cheesy and reminded me of a tuna dip.   The cheesecakes here are of course KILLER!!!!  Although a bit pricier than other chains, the Cheesecake Factory has dishes that are fresh with amazing flavor.  I'm never disappointed coming here and again my favorite all time dish here is the miso salmon."
