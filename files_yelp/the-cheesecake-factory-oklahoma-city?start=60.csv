Tim S.,"Oklahoma City, OK",43,184,266,4.0,9/5/2015,"First off, if you come here and don't get cheesecake, your wrong.   I failed by not taking a picture of our desserts (Reese's, lemon and Raspberry, and carrot cake cheesecakes).  I ordered the fried catfish dinner, came with mashed potatoes, green beans and corn.  The seasoning on the cat fish was really good and you could tell the corn was right off the cob.  My wife ordered the Baja chicken tacos, which were amazing and the lime cilantro white rice that came with it was really good as well.  Overall great dinner, just hold back on the entrée's and save room for dessert.  One thing that bugged me a little, but isn't necessarily bad, was that the menu almost had too many options."
Rena R.,"Oklahoma City, OK",0,4,10,2.0,1/25/2015,"So sad to say that after waiting for couple hours for seating and foods. They also mess up our order, one of my friend has to wait till everybody about to finish for his food. 30 minutes for them to split the ticket :(. OMG, this's the first time in my life that I have to wait and deal with such many troubles at a American restaurant."
Nigel P.,"Oklahoma City, OK",30,142,109,4.0,4/29/2015,"Out of all the generic chain restaurants, Cheesecake Factory is on point and I don't even get dessert! The menu is enormous and serves all types of food ranging from American, Italian, Chinese, and Mediterranean. I'm pretty sure you can get almost any type of mainstream food here. The food is consistent, if overpriced, but you don't go to this restaurant for value. Anyone can find something appealing on the menu here. It's probably the most robust and varied menu I've seen in OKC. Its steep prices are somewhat made up for in huge portion size."
Thomas B.,"Oklahoma City, OK",29,25,15,4.0,8/2/2016,"Me and my Wife visited Cheesecake Factory on July 30th, half priced cheesecake day! We chose to sit out on the patio during the sunny afternoon. At this time the restaurant was very busy but our waiter helped us to the best of his ability and was very polite the entire time.  We got our menu and was shown the specials. Something new we noticed was the availability of the lunch menu on weekends now. This is new for most restaurants we've visited and was a nice option and something we'll take into consideration for next time. Overall we greatly enjoyed our meal, the food was flavorful and the perfect temperature. It's always disappointing to go to a busy restaurant and get cold food, but here it was on point. Another plus to this trip was our table-bread was actually warm! Our cheesecake was delicious and really cured my sweet tooth for the weekend. The only downside to our trip to C.F. was service. It had nothing to do with our waiter or the waitstaff that helped us, but more on the organization of the waitstaff. It seemed for the entire patio of at least a dozen tables, there was only our one server. He would have to carry out orders for three different tables at a time to keep caught up. Me and my wife are pretty patient, so we expected to be there awhile. But it was easy to see that some customers were getting irate with the lack of service. Maybe it was the heat... Overall we'll be returning to C.F. Again in the future and venture more from our comfort zone and try some new foods to review!"
Sam A.,"Oklahoma City, OK",12,106,13,2.0,2/20/2016,"As a California native, I'm a big fan of Cheesecake Factory. I miss this place and I make sure to stop by every time in California. This location is not the Cheesecake Factory I know. I came here on a Friday night with my wife and kid. You always expect a wait so that was no problem. We got seated and it just took a long time to get some service. The table beside us was seated a few minutes after us and someone greeted them immediately. They received their drinks fast too. After all that, we finally got some service. As it turns out, we had the same server. I guess he could only tend one table at a time. My wife asked for the nutritional menu. It's common practice for her to ask and receive one. The server didn't quite know what that was. He said he would check. He comes back and says they don't have one available. Ok fine. My wife decided to order a turkey sandwich but we were told they are out of turkey. My wife goes to her next option; they are out of that too. We order margaritas--by far the worst margaritas we've ever had. We could have drank margaritas out of a can that tasted better. Like I said, I'm not sure what's up with this location but I hope people don't think they are all like this."
Anisah H.,"Manhattan, NY",20,298,358,1.0,11/17/2015,"They couldn't just take the gnocchi noodles back and apologize, they had to insult my professionally trained palate! First I would just like to say that I have been preparing various types of pasta since  I was 8 years old starting out under my mother and grandmother in the kitchen; with that being said I stand almost 30 years old and I know exactly what al dente pasta is and how it should be achieved depending on which pasta is being prepared. Today around 2:00 pm I stopped in to pick up a dinner portion of Fettuccine alfredo with grilled chicken to go, to share for lunch. What I was served was something reminiscent of gnocchi in fettuccine form. This culinary faux pas may happen for a number of reasons, one being the water to noodle ratio is incorrect, (not enough water to noodles) which was most likely the problem here.  I placed the food back in the original container and returned for a refund to be insulted by some person who didn't even tatse the food in order to qualify to have an opinion on the dish. How dare you? Next time, apologize, then offer to make the food properly, and if you are seriously sorry offer a free soft drink or dessert. Never insinuate that a customer doesn't comprehend what a basic dish of anything should be. You take the payments so take the payments and mind your manners, do not tell me that people enjoy eating rubbery chewy doughy pasta, those people and you apparently need to make pasta-mush-gum paste in their own kitchens on your own time  because as a  restaurant you should set the bar higher than that, you should know better, you shouldn't be wasting my time, and your customer service should be basic if not better. I paid for fettuccine not your idea of edible play-doh or your crass opinion in general. Al dente does not equal gumdrops. Figure it out."
Harley B.,"Eau Claire, WI",0,25,,4.0,11/16/2016,"Great food, great service and of course they have great dessert, strawberry cheesecake was awesome!"
Monique S.,"Central Oklahoma City, Oklahoma City, OK",0,2,,1.0,7/22/2017,"If I could give Cheesecake Factory less than 1 star, I would. I never post anything on yelp because I feel like any restaurant can have an off night. However, when the staff is less than helpful when food is brought to the table frozen in the middle and the plates are completely cold, an apology and a replacement entree' is all that is needed. We spoke to with 2 managers that did not acknowledge the cold food. One person in our party never received their original order, and they received the replacement entree' that was frozen in the middle. No one apologized or an the original entree' that was offered never made it to the table.  There was not any acknowledgement for the lack of food service by our waiter as well.  I will not be visiting this location ever again. There are a lot of options in Oklahoma City that far surpass this culinary experience and receiving bad service at a major chain is not worth the time or money. I hope other people have a better experience at this location."
Daniel R.,"Enterprise, AL",5,8,1,2.0,9/6/2016,"Corn fritters didn't taste like corn, just deep fried batter and the pizza had just enough sauce to give a red tint. White chicken chili is just big chunks of chicken in a thick sauce. For the price of the food that isn't acceptable. Great service rose the review to a 2!"
Stephanie L.,"Chickasha, OK",0,1,,2.0,3/3/2017,"My husband, child ,and I chose the Cheesecake Factory for our family day/my birthday.  Huge mistake. It was a busy Sunday morning. I expected it to be busy like it was. We got seated quicker than I expected. Our waiter came to our table maybe 5 minutes after we were sat. He took our drink orders. We waited 10 minutes to get our drinks. He also brought us out some bread and we finished it before he could even come back and take our order. The Sunday brunch sounded wonderful. I ordered "" fried chicken and waffles Benedict "". My hubby ordered a burger. We have a 17 month old daughter so she would just share with us. We waited and waited for our food to come out. Our waiter never offered more bread. A table seated after us got their food first. Finally our food arrived. It looked great. Big portions. Unfortunately I wasn't a fan of my food. I managed to get down half a waffle and that was it. Our waiter never came by to see how we were doing or how the food was tasting. When he did come by he cleared our plates and asked if we'd like dessert. I did. He brought us by the menu again to choose what we'd like. It took him a very long time to return to get out order. We had been waiting a long time so I just ordered a slice of cheesecake to go. All in all we were there for 2 hours and the service was slow and inattentive. Huge disappointment. Wish we hadn't wasted our family day on this restaurant. We even drove an hour out of our way to eat there."
Janelle A.,"Oklahoma City, OK",610,262,69,4.0,7/17/2015,"Cheesecake has been my favorite dessert for as long as I can remember, so of course this place is one of my favorites. Their cheesecake is to die for! The food is also pretty great! If anything, though, come for the cheesecake. That's what makes this place memorable."
Ltray R.,"San Antonio, TX",7,65,5,2.0,6/26/2015,Poor Service. Be prepared to wait for your waitress/ waiter for at least 20 min after seated. They messed up and forgot that we where there. The manager apologized and took our drink orders. Then they forgot again! We finally saw the manager took our order for starters and dinner. The dinner came 35 min after and the starters came 10 min after our dinner!  We did complain and they did offer one of the appetizers for free but regardless the service in this restaurant really needs to improve.  Food is up the CheeseCake Factory. Just not the service.
Jennifer W.,"Altus, OK",2,5,5,2.0,3/19/2016,"We arrived at 4.30p on a Saturday. Since there are five of us we weren't bothered by a 15 minute wait. Axel was our server and seemed to care less, although he was super attentive to the table of three right next to us. When our food finally did come it was only three plates of the five. We waited six minutes for another plate then the last plate showed up four minutes later. The kicker is that it was the kids meal that arrived last. At the very least get the child's meal out first...how hard is it for chicken strips and fries?!  There was a table of seven near us and amazingly they managed to get all of their food at the same time. The food itself was average; good but not spectacular for the price. The cheesecake is always good."
Michelle L.,"Oklahoma City, OK",40,6,,5.0,3/31/2016,"Great service and amazing food! Yes, it is pricey, but who doesn't love cheesecake? The general manager stopped by our table and was very nice to us! Will return!"
Mike M.,"Portland, OR",155,6,,4.0,2/27/2016,"I don't normally review chain restaurants, but the service at this location is out of this world. My friend and I were looking for a restaurant that served late and we found The Cheesecake Factory as we walked out of the mall. We walked in and were seated immediately. Our server, Laura M, was one of the best servers I've ever had. She was attentive, patient, and accommodating, especially when she learned about my dietary restrictions. She made us feel right at home, so much so that I'd recommend asking for her by name to anyone going to this particular location.  I did have one complaint, but it had absolutely nothing to do with the service. The tile floor was hazardously slick throughout the restaurant. I was concerned about face-planting on the way to our table and every time I left my seat. It's like there was grease smeared all over the floor. Honestly, even if this was never remedied, it wouldn't scare us away. People like Laura will always bring in repeat customers. She's spectacular and I'll be back even if it means I have to crawl to my table. Anyway, fix that floor and I'll update this review to 5 stars."
Rebecka M.,"Spencer, OK",45,166,161,3.0,9/15/2015,The food is good. The menu is so big it's daunting but they have options for almost anything you could want. I think it's overpriced. It's always packed so it's best to come in the mid-afternoon in between lunch and dinner hours or else you won't be able to find a place to park and you'll have a long wait.
Sadie L.,"Abilene, TX",0,52,90,4.0,11/10/2015,The restaurant decor is nice and clean but a little dark in lighting. It was a little packed but the food and service was great and we didn't wait long at all to be seated or get our food. If you don't get a cheesecake after dinner make sure to get one to go! It's worth taking home. I will return again for another meal at this restaurant.
Alan H.,"Oklahoma City, OK",63,313,410,1.0,2/22/2015,"Ok, The Cheesecake Factory does not take reservations and will not allow anyone to add their party to the wait list unless the entire party is present. We walked in at 1215 with a party of 9, 4 adults and 5 children. We were told the wait would be 30 minutes max. At 40 minutes manager approaches me and tells me party in our seats are eating dessert and it should be another 10 to 15 minutes. 20 minutes later, after we see a party of 9 seated that arrived well after us, I approach the manager and ask him how much longer as we have been waiting over an hour at this point.  He looks at us with a blank stare on his face and although he did not admit the fact he had skipped over us (either by mistake or on purpose) I realize he had as he again walks through the entire restaurant looking for a differant place to seat us. By this time my wife's furious and the children are starting to melt down being bored and hungry. The manager strings us along another fifteen minutes making our entire wait over 80 minutes!! We have never had a bad meal here, service has always been spot on. Joe, waiter, took great care of us, and although still seething with anger I took care of him as well via tip. Meals, dessert, two drinks came to $100. I won't be back. Any restaurant that does not take reservations, or call ahead, or allow one person to sign up party without entire party being present, AND THEN EVEN SCREW UP A WAIT LIST, does not get my return business. We were treated like badly behaving livestock waiting in the shoot to be castrated, one after the other, then sent on our way. I am so very sorry, yes i goofed that up bad.  Is there anything i can do to make it up to you....anything, just say the word! Cheesecake Factory but this pain won't go away this time. I won't be back."
Theresa D.,"Seattle, WA",273,278,126,5.0,6/18/2015,"Heads up, this place is near the mall so you may experience less than desirable waits and service due to the employees overwhelmed with the masses awaiting their deliciousness. Yes this place is great to chow down then walk off the calories or shop then relax with their encyclopedia of a menu. Some of my favorite appetizers are the Avacado rolls, white hummus, bang bang shrimp. Their pasta Da Vinci is delicious. And I've tried most of their cheesecakes so you're gonna have to go with what flavors speak to you. If you're a wino,  try their red sangria. I'm pretty sure I drink pitchers of that. So delicious. Don't be intimidated by the options as some people are. It's broken up so just find what flavors you're in the mood for and I'm sure your waiter can steer you into a direction that you'll enjoy."
Jordan L.,"Oklahoma City, OK",2,1,,4.0,11/7/2015,"The only thing WOW is the cheesecake. I had their pizza and I was kinda unhappy. The seats were not the greatest.   I was treated nicely by the staff. Also, the staff did a perfect job.   The place was clean and was very nice.   I had a kids' pizza, lemonade, and a fresh strawberry cheesecake."
