Esther L.,"Las Vegas, NV",113,209,68,4.0,5/24/2014,My visit here today was OK for a pretty established place as the cheesecake factory. I went this afternoon at 4 for an early dinner with my fiance and we were surprised at the lack of parking spot and how busy it was at this time.  The reason? I believe it was because of their great lunch special which lasts till 5 pm!! I got the spicy Chipotle chicken. They say lunch portion but I couldn't even eat half of it. I saw a sign in the front door and it said there is happy hour from Monday to Friday from 4-6pm on select appetizer being 5$. Considering their appetizers are usually 10 dollars this is a great deal to go with friends for an early dinner and try their wonderful small dishes.  One thing I always am sad about is that I eat so much I never have room for dessert!! I have tried the majority of their cheesecake but my favorite is the Hershey chocolate one! !! It's rich enough to satisfy your chocolate craving without being too overwhelming!
Scot M.,"Oklahoma City, OK",1,1,1,3.0,4/5/2014,"Nice atmosphere. Good menu selection. My wife and I were seated quickly on the patio amid a Friday night throng of other waiting customers waiting for seating. I overheard the host mention a 20 minute wait time for indoor tables.The server was wonderful and very attentive. The down side for me was the food. I ordered the Charbroiled Choulotte Steak. A cut of sirloin that was triangular on its cut and  roughly five inches long.I asked for medium-well and received a rare-medium serving. The server graciously returned it for a bit more cook time.Although the steak had good flavor, it was very tough to chew from being a bit overcooked on its return. My side of mashed potatoes were fair....nothing exciting. A little pricey for food that I would consider mediocre. If we return, I'll more than likely stick to the desserts!"
Vinton B.,"Oklahoma City, OK",106,87,26,2.0,1/2/2015,"Cheesecake Factory has great service and huge variety to select from in their menu. And their food is pretty good. But I have to emphasize ""pretty"". It's not great. However they are asking you to pay for great food and delivering pretty good.  There are so many great local places that specialize in the different foods offered here whose food is GREAT and will most likely be cheaper. It just doesn't stand up to the competition."
Tammy G.,"Huntington Beach, CA",319,714,5721,5.0,12/7/2011,"Probably my favorite chain - it is so consistent, wherever you go. My favorite menu item is the chicken medeira - it is fantastic. All of the cheesecake is wonderful. I love the key lime. Anything I have ever ordered has been tasty. A little pricey - but very delicious.  The atmosphere is very nice here - pretty decor. Nice location if you have been shopping. I like to meet friends here for lunch when I am in town."
Meghan B.,"Norman, OK",6,10,2,5.0,2/8/2015,"So, this place was different than what I expected. I has expected a restaurant atmosphere, and not a huge seating area where every server was wearing white, and there was a 2 hour wait!! Guess what?? We sat at the bar! Haha! Take that, people waiting on a booth! Bartender was great, and was very personable. She explained menu items, made my friend a FABULOUS Margarita that wasn't even on the menu, and gave us a very good first experience! I will be going back, AND sitting at the bar area next time.  Food was really good. Had the crab dip, and wings. Pretty darn good!! Smores cheesecake was so large, we really didn't have room for it, but it was fabulous! Ready to go there again!"
Joe C.,"Oklahoma City, OK",99,618,139,3.0,8/26/2013,"So look, Cheesecake Factory is certainly not going to be confused with fine dining any time soon. Here's one thing I'll throw out about them: Most chains figure they're going to do one thing well, and then they'll add a few throwaway dishes to cover the tastes of the folks who aren't interested in whatever they're most ""proud"" of. This is how you wind up with people like my [redacted], who will think nothing of ordering a glass of Chardonnay at a run-of-the-mill Mexican restaurant. Cheesecake Factory, on the other hand, has attempted to create mass-market, easily replicable and average-quality food that will appeal to the tastes of ANYONE who walks in the door. Any four random pages of their menu book would be more than enough for your average chain, and they have way, way more than four pages. I've had the food more than I wish, and while it isn't great, it is usually at least average and keeps that standard across the ridiculous variety of stuff they're churning out. And I also give them bonus points for having the word ""factory"" in their name. It's not like they're hiding what they're up to, are they? You need great service to get to ""above average"" for this kind of place, and I've never had that at this location. But there are chains out there doing way less ambitious work, and not doing it as well."
Tiffani D.,"San Antonio, TX",87,64,73,4.0,9/25/2016,always consistent on the service and food drinks are good also just a basic all around great place can get super loud at times but its tailorable.
Rosie G.,"El Reno, OK",0,16,,1.0,1/16/2016,"We visited this restaurant on a Saturday at noon with my husband and two small children. The wait was at 15-20 minutes and we got seated 5 minutes into the wait so was a relief. Here comes the frustrating part. The hostess sat us down and I asked where my highchair was and she said she would bring it right out. I don't like to sit down with my 13 month old unless he is in his highchair otherwise once the highchair arrives he will only want to be in my arms. Something any toddler mom can understand. I am standing there for about 5 minutes while the hostess continues to sit people and no server in sight. I finally walk up to the hostess and she said ""sorry we are out"". While she is saying the word ""out"" she is walking away from me not allowing me to ask how long my wait would be. I go sit down. Finally 10 minutes later our server arrives to take the drink order. Long story short I ate my entire meal with one hand while holding my toddler in the other. Incredibly frustrating having to do that while paying $17 per plate and $7 for a kids meal. I did ask the server and even the manager 2-3 times if there was one available during our meal and the answer was no every time. I am never visiting this place again.  P.S IKEA has highchairs for $15 incase you don't want to ruin another tired moms meal again."
Jennifer F.,"Springdale, AR",51,25,14,2.0,3/25/2016,"I normally love Cheesecake Factory. Here in OKC, we were seated within 5 minutes, which is good bc no one was there. After we ordered, we waited about 20 min for our food, which is fine but server was in such a hurry to flip his table, he wanted to box up our meals a few minutes in. Food was ok, overpriced for the quality. Cheesecake was yummy, as always. Server wanted our ticket paid before we ever got dessert n then offered to package it up quickly. Whole dinner was rushed. We were in and out in 50 minutes for a $100 dinner and almost half of that was waiting on three entrees."
Leland C.,"Yukon, OK",0,15,,2.0,2/10/2016,"Overprice on everything, went with the ""Famous Factory Meatloaf"" bland no real flavor. You can get a whole cheesecake for the same price as a slice. Wait staff was excellent."
Babs A.,"Oklahoma City, OK",2,17,,1.0,10/15/2015,"It's a shame one cannot post without giving a star...that explains my star. Approximately eight to ten times per month, I eat a grilled artichoke from The Cheesecake Factory.  Tonight my husband stopped by to get carry out and much to my dismay, the artichoke was very different.  Not seasoned at all, just boiled in water and tossed on a grill for grill marks.  It was so awful I couldn't eat it at all.  My very patient husband took it back to explain that it had none of the usual delicious heavy seasoning.  He brought back what looked like a seasoned one but as I delved into it I realized the seasoning had only been sprinkled on the outside leaves.  Always the seasoning has been in the interior leaves as well.  Same blah artichoke....I'm throwing it out but angry enough to write this review.  This is the third disappointment in a carry out meal, otherwise I would just let it go.  Mentioning a problem to management has been useless so YELP, there you have it."
Brandy S.,"Oklahoma City, OK",0,2,29,1.0,11/15/2015,My family and I went to the Cheesecake Factory for lunch on a Saturday afternoon. We all ordered our meals but they brought my son's meal 20 minutes before any of the other meals...even before we received our appetizer. I ordered the meatloaf and mashed potatoes...my meatloaf was raw in the middle and I was sick the next day. We also found something foreign in our cheesecake...string we believe. We were all so disappointed from beginning to end. We hope this cautions people from this restaurant.
Angela G.,"Miami, FL",145,139,139,4.0,9/20/2014,"I wish I could write two reviews for the Cheesecake Factory. One for the food and one for the desserts. The food is just ok. It's not bad but it's not my favorite place to eat. The menu is a little overwhelming, but it is a great place to take a big group because they have everything from pizza to tacos.  The cheesecake is 5 stars! I have come here just for dessert several times. The choices are endless and the flavor is great! I know they have other desserts, but I pretty much stick to the cheesecakes."
David F.,"Edmond, OK",1,8,22,1.0,4/19/2016,"So disappointed! This is usually our treat night restaurant. We went on Saturday evening early to beat the crowds. You can usually count on great service, great meals, great desert... and a fairly large bill. I don't mind that bill thing if all the other characteristics are in place, but Saturday night was a complete fail on their part. We started out with one server and after our order was placed, we had someone new. Our drinks were never refilled and we rarely saw our server. My daughter ordered the BBQ burger with the sauce on the side (pretty difficult huh). It came out fully drenched in BBQ ranch sauce. My daughter and I received our meals but our server said he would be right out with my wife's meal (chicken madeira). So we waited....and waited...and waited until a manager walked up and said her meal was served to the wrong table. He apologized and refilled our drinks because our waiter was no where to be seen. Several minutes later we were getting antsy because we were going to be late for our movie. Several more minutes pass and here comes the manager with her food. He offered to buy us a piece of cheesecake but we explained we were running late for our movie. He then offered to discount (not delete) the cost of her meal. It seemed like his biggest concern was getting off without giving a freebie. My wife said we would take the discount. We hurried through our meal to get to the movie. Our waiter then appeared briefly, just long enough to drop off the fully priced meal. Apparently the manager WAS really concerned about his margin. He never got that ""partial discount"" applied to our meal. I think he knew we were, at that point, in too big of a hurry to wait for a corrected check. For your attention to your margin, Mr. Manager, you purchased this review and a former customer. I hope it was worth it. If money doesn't grow on trees at your house, think twice about making this your treat night restaurant."
John R.,"Reno, NV",52,368,31,4.0,7/6/2014,"Decided to give this restaurant another chance after about 7 years of swearing to never go there again (different location, different state). We were not disappointed. The menu is not lacking in choices (almost too many actually). It has a nice variety of things to choose from for even the pickiest of eaters. The food quality has definitely improved over the years. The server was excellent, not overbearing and always seemed to appear when we needed him. The desserts were outstanding but as a helpful tip, you may want to share with a table mate or you will be taking half of it to go."
Kim N.,"Oklahoma City, OK",78,100,307,4.0,5/15/2014,"I've been to Cheesecake Factory many times over the years. I don't think the food is amazing, and the cheesecakes are good but nothing I crave (I'm a baker myself so it's pretty hard to impress my sweet tooth). Food is predictable and consistent, so it's a good place for a crowd where everyone has different tastes. There's pretty much something for everyone. I gave four stars because my husband's favorite dish is the Steak Dianne, and it's pretty darn good. I've always received good service here, though it can be a little slow with a large lunch crowd. The lunch portions are still pretty large and will fill you up, though I'm not sure if it's the food or complimentary bread that fills me up more. If I had to pick a cheesecake though, it would be the dark chocolate cheesecake, though I can't remember its specific name. Mmmmm I love dark chocolate!"
Jasmine E.,"Plano, TX",163,124,113,4.0,10/3/2015,Service was great! I have been coming here for years and nothing changes which is a good thing! The food is always excellent and the drinks are always strong like I like them! When u drive 3 hours for some good food that lets you know this is place to be!!!
Lesley H.,"Joint Base Lewis-McChord, WA",0,11,1,1.0,11/14/2015,"Food was good, service not so much. Erica did not go out of her way to be a good server. She split the check without asking and then when I asked to put them together, she said can I just run  them separate. I could tell by her body language that she hates her job."
Patti A.,"Oklahoma City, OK",0,5,,1.0,3/12/2016,"Worse service Oklahoma City Cheesecake Factory.  People who were seated after and next to us were waited on and received their food first.  But it gets worse.  These people finished their food, got their dessert and bill before we ever received our order at the table.  I went to notify the manager that we had not received out food.  And, like the manager could not understand the problem.  Our order finally arrrived and the waiter explained the glitch which was in the computer, but he never bothered coming over and explaining the situation until after the manager was notifed.  So it was nearly 30-45 mins before we ever received our lunch orders (sandwiches and salads -duh!).  And the manager nor waiter ever offered any compensation or free anything.  I won't be going back again."
K S.,"Dill City, OK",1,9,6,2.0,5/16/2015,"I ate at here 5-12-15. This was my first time to eat at a Cheesecake Factory. I was soooo disappointed! Our service was horrible. Our waitress was terrible! She never refilled our drinks. Never came to check on us. She was very rude when we waved to her & asked her for refills. The food was mediocre. The sauce was good the pasta was good but my shrimp was way overcooked, tough, and chewy. The only reason I am giving two stars is the cheesecake. It was phenomenal! It was a large piece, creamy, fabulous! Everyone at our table got something different  for dessert and it was all fantastic. My entrée was  $18, my margarita was $10.50, and my white chocolate, caramel, macadamia nut cheesecake was around $7. It is a pretty expensive place to eat. If I ever go back it will be for the cheesecake only and I will get it to go."
