Tyler B.,"North Central Omaha, Omaha, NE",169,68,38,5.0,12/5/2017,I had the chicken mandarin.  Chicken was just right and and had the perfect flavour. I have been there several times and my brother worked there for 7 years. It is a great company and they have always tried to make Sure that you leave there happy if there are any issues with your experience. Make sure you share them because they will correct any error!
Snow M.,"Omaha, NE",139,213,385,4.0,9/23/2017,"It is the Cheesecake Factory. What more can be said? Huge menus, huge portions, strong drinks. I recommend the pot stickers because of that wonderful sauce. They do have some lighter fare menu options for those watching calories. If you get creative, you can stick to your macros. They even have low carb cheesecake but seriously, if you are going to fall off the wagon let it be face first into a slice of their full fat, full calorie laden, mouth watering cheesecake. Be smart, share it with a friend or two."
J M.,"Clovis, NM",5,219,277,5.0,11/24/2017,Always a win! I just wish it was so pricy. Why are apps the same price as a dish. Come on..but I still can't resist those firecracker salmon spring rolls. I got a curry dish was so good...minus the nuts. I don't like nuts in my meals. My daughter got her go to Cajun chicken pasta. Service was prompt and friendly
Yogeshree T.,"Seattle, WA",77,98,36,4.0,2/14/2017,"Best part about Cheesecake Factory is the quality they maintain at every location and you can always expect to get what you are craving out of their large menu. We, the business travelers, turned up here for an easy evening dinner. I had the herb roasted Lemony salmon with mashed potatoes and grilled asparagus and it was yummy and creamy rich. My two other colleagues went for chicken pasta and chipotle salad and were happy. The service was quick and the server was nice and fast. We wanted to get a fast dinner and we were done in an hour which was nice."
Emily M.,"Omaha, NE",2,59,75,3.0,7/18/2017,We were seated immediately about 1 foot away from other customers on each side which was an uncomfortable start especially considering the restaurant was not very busy. The food was good but our server was AWOL most of the time.
Patricia M.,"Mansfield, TX",23,11,9,5.0,9/4/2017,"Everything is yummy except the pastas- huge dish not so great on flavor. We went about 4 or 5 times so far. The service always outstanding and the food is above delicious. The salads, starters, steak, my last try was chicken and was to die for. Mouth watering cheesecake display - you can't go wrong. Great place! Try the lemon raspberry cheesecake, also the mousse chocolate or the Oreo... the red velvet is amazing too... well can't pass the cheesecake!"
John R.,"New Bern, NC",0,12,5,2.0,3/22/2017,"My wife and I went to the Cheesecake Factory for the first time and we were very disappointed.  We both ordered the Rennet's lunch special (I think that was the name?) she got the turkey sandwich with the default salad and I got the almond chicken salad sandwich with the Caesar Salad and we each had the soup of the day.  My almond chicken salad sandwich tasted like tuna/ranch on buttered toast- not bad tasting, but not even close to what I expected.  Her default salad had very little (watered down?) ranch and neither of us wanted it - it sucked. My Caesar salad was good, except my croutons may have been a little stale.  Our soup of the day - apparently they only have 1 soup that changes each day? Anyways, it was a mushroom based soup that tasted sweet.. some people might be into that, but I hated it (wife thought it was alright). I hate throwing away food, but I couldn't stomach it past 3 spoon fools.  I thought the food was fairly expensive for what we got, let alone the fact the food sucked..  The ONE thing we both really enjoyed was the Cheesecake. The cheese cake lived up to the hype we heard, but even then it wasn't without issue- we got two cheese cakes with Lunch and requested 2 to go. The two brought out to the table were great and large, the two we got to go were already packed up and significantly smaller- not sure if that is their protocol or not, or if certain cheesecakes are larger than others and the two we had dinning in were two of the 'larger' cakes and the two we got to go were 'smaller' cakes. Despite the cheesecake being good, we don't plan on going back, ever.  I'd recommend just going for the cheesecake/desert if you go at all, but this was our only time here, so we obviously can't spell for the other menus items.  One last closing note- we had a good server."
Angel N.,"Omaha, NE",122,82,261,5.0,8/29/2017,"This was my first time here at cheesecake factory in Omaha, and I have to say it was great! Although I didn't have any room for dessert, I'd have to come back on empty stomach so I can fill up and try their cheesecakes. The ambiance and atmosphere was nice and calm but it gets a little hectic with the waiting list after 7 pm which is normal but all in all it was good experience. Friendly waitresses and staff."
Justin B.,"Bellevue, NE",37,65,12,4.0,12/29/2016,"I went to the Cheesecake Factory a few nights ago with my mother and girlfriend. So here is how this went down. We only had to wait about 15 minutes before the buzzer went off and we were seated. No complaints there. The waiter then took our order and disappeared into the kitchen. About 15 minutes went by and no food came; however the waiter came back twice to let us know it was a busy night and to thank us for being patient. Cool. After another 5 minutes or so the manager came by to appologize and thank us for our patience and let us know our food was on our way. Usually I would have an issue with the length of time it took to get our food; however the manager and his staff were rather engaged with us about it so I did not take issue.  Next, My and my gf's dinner was fine. Mac-n-Cheese burger was absolutely delicious. Properly cooked and fantastic. My gf's Chicken Bellagio was also fantastic. Properly cooked and the noodles were done just right. However, my mother's Mushroom burger was a disaster. The saute'd mushrooms were so crispy you would have thought they were fried. The burger was so over done, you would have thought you were at a military ""burger burn"" fundraiser. She choked through half of it before I told her she needed to bring it to the waiter's attention. Once the waiter came back; she spoke to him about it. He immediately apologized and said that he would go get the manager for us.  Once the manager came, he looked at what was on my mother's plate and said he would get a new one out for her immediately and apologized profusely. The manager was very professional. Now, we are not the type of people that get ""screamy"" and ""yelly"" when things go wrong. Mistakes happen. So goes life. So, the manager asked us what he could do to fix the issue, my mother said she just wanted a properly cooked meal and would leave that decision up to the manager. The manager stated he would get her a properly cooked meal ASAP and he would also comp the meal for the inconvenience. About 8 minutes later, a properly cooked Mushroom burger arrived and it was ""excellent"" according to my mother. Cool. 3 out of 3 great meals. Cool.  Then came dessert. Plain Cheesecake and Pumpkin Pecan Cheesecake. ""Oh Em Gee"" was it delicious. The Pumpkin Pecan is definitely dangerous. Not overly sweet; but very addictive. Sadly it is ""seasonal"".  So all in all; the food was good, and management did great in correcting a poorly cooked meal. All things said and done; I have no qualms about going back. I can definitely say that if I a mistake happens in the kitchen-I know it will be corrected promptly. Mistakes happen; and the manager knows how to fix them. A definite recommend."
Erin F.,"Omaha, NE",50,159,144,1.0,1/29/2017,"Boy oh boy do we need another location in town. We decided to get carry out last night and the Bakery/carry out counter was completely overwhelmed. We were told 30 mins for food, in actuality it was 45 minutes. It would have been longer but we spotted our food being shuffled onto a shelf and ignored, had we not asked about it we would've ended up like the guy before us who was ignored for ten minutes while his food got cold. The carry out window forgot our dessert and had us stand and wait for it as they shuffled through piles of tickets looking to see if we had actually paid for it. When they finally bagged it we were told they were out of napkins and silverware. The other issue is the food quality which has been steadily declining as of late. On our last visit we received burned carbonara and the waitress balked at replacing it, the visit before that I received chicken that was undercooked. Last night the asparagus side was inedible, overcooked, and an off color. They also seem to have changed their once delicious carrot cake to a flavorless slice of mediocrity that is 2/3 the size it was previously.  I recommend visiting a place that values their customers a little more highly to satisfy your sweet tooth at least until they sort out their management and food quality issues."
Melita S.,"Sioux Falls, SD",0,20,8,5.0,11/14/2017,the cheesecake is amazing. And we are still trying to make it as good back in Croatia. But I don't see that happening anytime soon. I had the most amazing server at this restaurant and this at is the only reason I keep coming back and of course the Cheesacake. I am not from Omaha but I am sure this location is not in the ghetto and I believe the prices are reasonable.
Ka'ili H.,"Omaha, NE",235,381,194,4.0,9/19/2017,"What can go wrong at the cheesecake factory?  Other than the fact that they discontinued my ultimate favorite cheesecake, the Kahlua cocoa coffee cheesecake, everything else they make is pretty darn good.  Service is also great, waiters and waitresses come by often to check on you and make sure everything tastes great and waters are filled.  I love coming to their happy hour and enjoying their avocado egg rolls.  The menu is enormous so it's usually hard for me to decide what I want.  What I do love is the Godiva chocolate brownie sundae.  The presentation is gorgeous you almost don't want to eat it.  But once you do it's over!  You've got dollops of ice cream with whipped cream on top, three pieces of warm brownie lined in between the ice cream and godiva chocolates nestled in the whipped cream to top it off!  It's pretty amazing I wish I could be eating one right now!  Other than their amazing desserts they also have great alcoholic drinks and I've always loved their garlic pasta with chicken dish too.  Like I said, what can go wrong here other than taking away an amazing cheesecake?"
Megan B.,"Omaha, NE",19,11,3,2.0,10/15/2017,This company/management needs to learn how to manage the requests of people who want to come in for Cheesecake to go.  Being told it would take 5-10 minutes to box a slice of cheesecake when there's no line at the counter is unacceptable.
Lianna N.,"Omaha, NE",361,1033,7522,4.0,4/15/2016,"There is definitely a draw to Cheesecake Factory than every American feels. It might be the large dining space, or the expansive menu that has something for all. If not the first 2, well, it's the cheesecake! There are so many flavors it's really hard to go wrong with any of them. My personal favorite is the classic with the strawberries on top or the white chocolate raspberry.  CF suits families, casual diners, first dates/date night, pre-prom, etc. It's all American! This is the only location in Omaha/Lincoln, and I know people from Lincoln who drive to Omaha just to eat here.  Service is always pretty good as they have 1 million servers. The only negative here is that it's such a busy location that sometimes there's a wait to eat if you don't come at a good hour. Overall this is a very popular chain that has done well for many many years. It's a staple at malls across America, and we just can't seem to get enough!"
Erin N.,"Bennington, NE",44,91,158,2.0,12/8/2016,"Came here a few days ago on a date night with hubby, we dont plan on coming back, except maybe for some cheesecake for carry out.  We walked in and were seated right away but we were sat at a half booth half table that barely fit anything on the table it was so tiny! We were practically touching elbows with the people at the table next to us. I'm talking so close we would get wiffs of their breath. It made me nauseous.  The server came and got our drink order. When she came back with our drinks we ordered the ""fried cheese"" for an appetizer. It took quite a while for our appetizer to come out but we are pretty patient so we brushed it off and placed our dinner order when she brought it out. I was not a fan at all. It was fried mozzarella and asiago (I think?) but it tasted really weird, kind of like a loaded baked potato or something. The cheese could have been melted a bit more too. We sat and talked, waiting for probably a good 30 to 45 minutes for our food to come out. I noticed a chunk of food on our silverware that we hadn't yet used. Hubby said how his silverware felt greasy and his menu was too.  Finally the food came out. I got fish and chips like the last time we came here, but it didn't look very tasty like I had remembered. They also raised the price to $17.99. I tried the fries, they were good. What you would expect. I didn't even try the slaw, just not my thing. Then there's the fish. The star, what I was so excited for. It was bland, and WAY overbattered! I couldn't get a good picture because of the dark lighting but honestly it was like 25% fish and 75% batter. I'm not even kidding. I had to pull off most of the breading to even see or taste fish. The fish was extremely small and thin and over cooked. Some pieces were hard to chew. Tartar sauce was good though.. This meal was not worth the price at all. I felt completely ripped off. Hubby got a burger of some sort that he thought was pretty good, nothing special though. He said they barely put any mushrooms on it and they charged us $2 for a slice of cheese. We were frustrated with the whole situation and just wanted to leave. We waited for a good 10 minutes before our server came and took our food to be boxed up and give us our check. I only ate a few fries and a single torn up piece of fish. Hubby only had about half of his burger. I really wanted to get a slice of cheesecake but I had just witnessed the table next to us wait for 15 or 20 minutes for some, so no thanks. I didn't think about it until writing this review but with so little food eaten on our plates you would think they would ask if we didn't like our food but they didn't. We arent ones to complain and we had things we had to go do. I was so excited to come back but left disappointed. The service was fine but scarce, and the food was extremely unpleasant in my case. I left just as hungry as when I showed up and even went to the gas station on the way to run errands to get a slushie and a snack just to not feel famished! I think it's safe to say we wont be returning or at least to this location."
Royal B.,"Omaha, NE",424,256,17,4.0,9/13/2016,"Cleanliness 4 Service 5 Food 4 Likelihood 5 1-5 (5 Best!) 4.5 We we greeted by the front desk employee quickly, and seated within minutes.  Our server stopped by to greet us and get our drink order, also within minutes.  Our appitizer arrived and througout the meal our server never let either of our drinks go empty, great work!   She was quick to help, and always a glance away.  VERY good!  Jonny does not get along with seeded buns, and the staff responded without fail to get it replaced quickly.  Thank you.  The restrooms were spotless. She cleared our dishes and tried hard to get us dessert, we were too full.  Manager was in dining room but was not stopping by tables.  Great meal expereince."
Chad K.,"Gretna, NE",18,450,461,4.0,1/28/2016,"This is a fun place to grab a meal. It can be bit noisy and crowded, but that's just a result of its popularity. They have a huge menu. It's sort of an ongoing punchline actually. It's essentially a book. On the plus side, they have something for just about every taste. That makes this a pretty agreeable place to dine as you can have a half dozen people in your party craving a half dozen different kinds of cuisine and they can all find something to eat here. I tend to stick to either the Shepherds Pie or the Orange Chicken. I'm not sure why. Both are excellent. I've tried one or two other entrées on their menu as well, but I always come back to those two. The Avocado Egg Rolls are pretty tasty too, but incredibly rich.  Prices are a bit more than what it seems most non-regulars are expecting to pay. It's not so much because it's upscale or fine dining (though it is a nice place to dine) but a matter of supply and demand. This place does not hurt for business and so they're priced accordingly. I've heard from a lady that works as a trainer at a Cheesecake Factory in another city that a shockingly large amount of their food is indeed prepared from scratch each day. This is in contrast to most chain restaurants where everything seems to arrive already prepared in plastic bags. I detest the seating. Ask for a booth and pray you get one. If you get a table you will be sitting close enough to other dining parties to literally rub elbows and when their waitperson shows up and stands between the tables to hand out food or drinks you'll have a waitperson butt in your face. At this price point I really shouldn't have to feel like a sardine in a can. Service is usually pretty good.  I've had great service and I've had marginal service, but I've never had terrible service here. Restaurant is always very clean."
Zack G.,"Omaha, NE",36,78,13,4.0,8/31/2016,"I love it here. I've always had impeccable service and deliciously prepared food. It's kind of pricey I'll say. Some of my favorite food is the mushrooms for an appetizer, steak is always prepared well, and the Mac n cheese from this place is amazing. Also the mashed potatoes are made from real potatoes with chunks in them. So good. As far as cheesecake we like the banana and the peanut butter cup. Sweets coma. Bring your wallet."
Christye G.,"Iowa City, IA",231,476,1272,3.0,1/28/2017,"I came here for my birthday. I was blown away with how busy and packed they were for 1 o'clock. I was expecting quiet and not many people. They seated us quickly. I liked how the pager fit in my pocket. The restroom was cute but too small to accommodate that large of a volume of people. I was frustrated and disappointed that they seated people on either side of us, so we had no where to put our coats because we had booth seating on my side of the table and my other friends had the chairs. And being so scrunched together, I felt like my butt was on their table. Luckily the people on either side of us were friendly because privacy was definitely invaded. The food was the bomb. They forgot my friend's salad dressing and it took a while to flag down the waiter. Oh, my! My s'mores cheesecake was delicious (and beautiful)! Our waiter gave us the wrong checks. He didn't seem very organized but then again, none of the staff seemed too enthused to be there. It was nice to visit with my friends but I felt claustrophobic. If it wasn't a special occasion, I wouldn't spend $8 for a slice of cheesecake."
Moira R.,"Omaha, NE",87,233,665,2.0,9/24/2015,"Despite preferring local restaurants, there are some chains that I really love. Unfortunately the Cheesecake Factory doesn't do much for me. I usually find myself here once a year or so, and the food is good, but it isn't great, and is a little pricey for what you get. Their cheesecake is very good, though. As a lot of other reviewers mentioned, the menu is huge. It is basically a giant book with any kind of food you could want (burgers, salads, wraps, pizza, Thai food, Mexican food, etc.). On the plus side, you shouldn't have any trouble finding something on the menu that you will like. It is a little overwhelming having to flip through a giant book (with excessive advertisements and photos in the middle) to look over the entire menu, though.  My husband and I went here for dinner on a weeknight. For an appetizer we ordered the Loaded Baked Potato Tots, which were served with ranch. Other than being a little too salty, these were awesome. The flavor was incredible and they were perfect dipped in the ranch.  For my entrée I went with the Barbecue Ranch Chicken Salad. The salad was huge and loaded with a large variety of toppings. The dressing was (per the name) a basic BBQ sauce and ranch dressing. The salad was good, but nothing amazing. My husband ordered the Thai Chicken Lettuce Wraps, which were served on a pretty impressive and large tray, and he was very satisfied with his meal.  Despite the restaurant being over half empty, we were seated at one of those long booth/table combos in which the tables are RIGHT next to each other, and there was a couple at the next table. The tables are so close that we were awkwardly close to the other people (I accidentally knocked them when I was trying to scoot in). I wouldn't have minded if the restaurant was even a little crowded, but it was really weird since it was almost empty (and the next 4 tables were completely empty). That couple left and another couple were sat at the same table (more awkwardness). Our server was friendly, but would disappear for long periods of time. We had to chase her down when we wanted to pay after we had waited 20 minutes for her to come back and she never showed.  I am sure I will end up here again in a year or so, and the food will probably be good, but it isn't someplace at which I would go out of my way to eat. I would totally go out of my way to stop in and get cheesecake from here if I was in the area (and they have a convenient counter at the front that makes it easy to do just that)."
Alexandra P.,"Omaha, NE",2,12,8,4.0,8/19/2016,The Original style cheesecake was the main reason I came here. And have to say as a staple cheesecake it was pretty ordinary and not what I was expecting. It was good but not good enough. I found the consistency to be much more thicken than others. My favorite part was the crust of course! Our server Doris was very nice and definitely provided quality customer service and made our dining an enjoyable experience. Will be coming back try other cheesecakes!
Sam B.,"Lincoln, NE",19,33,,5.0,4/12/2017,"For the longest time, I resisted going to the Cheesecake Factory even though my wife had been after me to take her there. I thought it was going to be one of those ""chick places"" that serves soups, salads, small sandwiches, and desserts (emphasis on the latter). I finally gave in and took her there. Boy was I wrong about this place! The food is incredible, reasonably priced, and the portions are definitely man-sized. The service was actually pretty good considering that it was a Saturday evening and the place was packed.  If I had any complaint at all about the Cheesecake Factory, it would be that the business it gets would easily support the opening of another location in Omaha. And while we're at it, let's put one in Lincoln too. You'd never get me out of the place!"
Rosie A.,"Omaha, NE",6,41,29,1.0,10/15/2016,$11.95 for a chocolate martini that was not good at all...no thank you! Last time for me. I'll stick to ordering their Chipotle chicken pasta on the curve and skip the drinks. It's the only dish I enjoy from there anyway.
Kelly L.,"Omaha, NE",0,2,,2.0,10/8/2017,"We have eaten at Cheesesteak Factory several times and everything is usually good.  Tonight, five people went for my daughter's birthday.  4 of the 5 entrees arrived after a lengthy period, but a burger came at least another 10 minutes after the four other entrees. The burger that was ordered well done came rare.  I had to go seek out the waitress but never found her, so told the hostess.  She said the manager would come over.  Another five minutes passed and still no manager...went back to the hostess to say ""we just want the burger cooked longer, can someone just come pick up the burger ?"".  More time went by before someone came to get the burger. The manager apologized and basically said she would comp the burger.  I told her this really wrecked my daugher's birthday dinner.  She offered free cheesecake.  Ok, we'll take it.   I am not kidding that another 15-20 minutes went by before the burger finally came.  The free cheesecake had to be requested two times before it came.   I don't know what happened tonight, but it was very awfully frustrating."
Brandon S.,"Omaha, NE",4,47,,5.0,11/21/2016,"I've never had a bad experience at the Cheesecake Factory. I came here yesterday for my sisters birthday. My favorite dish is the Factory Burrito, but yesterday I had the four cheese pasta with chicken and got a slice of pumpkin cheese cake to go. The food, service, cleanliness and decor has always been great. This is definitely a place I'll keep returning to."
Christine H.,"Omaha, NE",68,398,142,3.0,3/8/2016,"This place has gotten way too corporate. There are literally flat screen televisions above their cheesecake counter advertising their food and drink options. Nothing charming about that. In regards to their menu, while I appreciate  variety, their menu is just too large. It is literally 21 pages. Every time I go here I don't have the patience to go through it. Portions are massive which I am sure some people appreciate but it just isn't necessary and just perpetuates the cycle of overeating. The other night I got 2 cocktails and just those drinks were $24...way too high for a restaurant chain.  The food is good and I always enjoy their cheesecakes  but I think they should scale it back a bit."
Kendra D.,"Omaha, NE",47,66,139,4.0,3/15/2016,"Although, I usually like to support small local businesses, I've always been a fan of the Cheesecake Factory. I love that they've revamped their menu and have a separate ""Skinnylicuous"" menu; an easier way to control your portion sizes, all salads and entrees are under 600 calories. I ordered the Skinnylicuous Grilled Steak Medallions which were excellent! The meal was more than substantial and absolutely delicious! I also ordered the Red Sangria, which is listed at just 150 calories per glass. I love that I was able to eat out with a friend without feeling guilty after. The regular menu is hugely extensive and a little overwhelming. Sticking to the Skinnylicuous menu helped make my decisions much easier.  I noticed on my way in that they have happy hour Monday-Friday 4-6pm, so I will definitely be coming back to check that out!"
Anthony B.,"Omaha, NE",3,2,,2.0,4/17/2017,Next time maybe the manager could stop by during the 1:20 minutes we spend there. Clearly a future visit is highly important to this location
Michael C.,"Lexington, NE",0,6,,2.0,9/30/2017,I have been here a couple times the service  is always good my daughter who is 11 got her food and like any other time started to eat half way through it she bit into something hard she pulled out a piece of plastic I told the waitress and she new exactly what it was it was some sort of cap from the kitchen she got the manager involved he came by and asked if everything was alright I said no he apologized and said my daughter's meal will be free and a piece of cheese cake but when the bill came only the meal was subtracted not the cheese cake we ordered we are not there to get a free meal but if you as a manager say something to a customer keep your word will think about going back
Madeline W.,"Omaha, NE",1,10,3,4.0,4/7/2017,"My food was delicious (chicken and biscuits) and I tried the Tex Mex egg rolls for the first time. My usual favorite is the avocado egg roll appetizer which are wonderful for any avocado lover. This restaurant is a place I frequent. I usually don't have any problems, but most recently one of our orders was not entered into the system. He was served late but the manager compensated that meal-- which made everyone happy. I would recommend this place to anyone!"
Mikki D.,"Bonner Springs, KS",124,3,,5.0,3/28/2017,I love this restaurant. The food is always great and the service is good. My favorite dish is the stuffed chicken tortillas and key lime cheesecake.  I really wanted to write in because I ate there again today and it reminded me of the last time there and I watched the manager apologize to a table for like 20 minutes to a table of 12 some people and they were so rude. So I remembered and wanted to say thank you and remember not everyone is as rude as some of these people I'm sure you have to deal with.  Keep up the good work!
Nel P.,"Omaha, NE",50,153,530,5.0,7/25/2015,"One of our ""go to"" places!  Lots of selections for the picky eater and great atmosphere.  Bang bang chicken and shrimp is my favorite as well as Dulce de Leche cheesecake for dessert--which I highly recommend!"
Jennifer H.,"Omaha, NE",0,3,,1.0,9/16/2017,"I am celiac and I specifically explained this to the waitress when ordering my food, but according to my stomach, my meal was clearly full of gluten. I am so disappointed especially since their gf menu is very basic and marked gf. This should not have been an issue."
Tam R.,"Milford, NE",28,40,52,4.0,10/7/2016,"Back in August I was visiting Omaha and was in the mood for some good food. Stopped here for lunch and tried the shrimp scampi. Huge portion, lots of flavor and plenty of shrimp. This is one of my favorite dishes and the Cheesecake Factory did a great job. Took home the tiramisu cheesecake and it was heaven."
Rocky M.,"Golden, CO",0,5,1,5.0,8/22/2017,I took my sons.  We had a good time.  The place was packed but it was Sunday evening. We all had plenty to eat.  The menu has a lot to choose from. We had to take desert home with us because we were so full.  The portions are pretty sizable.  The service was pretty good considering it was packed.
Meshawn C.,"Bellevue, NE",3,20,4,4.0,9/28/2016,Had the cheesecake factory for the very first time. I will have to say the food is okay.... they give u a lot food but not what I expected as in price. I'm not a cheap person but it's a very pricey restaurant.
Ashleigh H.,"Omaha, NE",21,2,,1.0,2/14/2017,"Super disappointed as I've enjoyed eating in here. Tonight decided that we wanted to try the take out. Called for curbside pick up. After 25 minutes called again to see what was taking so long and they couldn't find my order. Girl comes out with ""our order"" which was the wrong order. So we waited 25 more minutes for them to bring out the right order. Offered no discounts or even an apology for that matter. Get home and the food was cold so turns out it was probably ready the whole time and they just forgot about it. It will take a lot to get me to come back and eat here. Customer service was just awful."
Taylor W.,"Omaha, NE",16,6,2,3.0,2/12/2017,Good food! But it takes 15 min to get a slice of cheesecake to go with no line at 8:30 on a Sunday night
Tasha K.,"Blair, NE",3,5,,1.0,2/2/2017,This place is horrible. Everything we ordered was not all that great. Only the cheesecake was good. I ordered the guacamole and it was tasteless. I told the waitress we were done eating it because it was very bland and not very good. She responded with oh ok and took the plate. Didn't ask to have something different or even a refund. And the salmon kale salad was a waste of money also. I think this places problem is the menu. Had way too many options to choose from. The smaller the menu the better quality food. I'll give it one star because the cheesecake is bomb.
Jennifer W.,"Parker, CO",0,3,,1.0,8/11/2017,I have been to Cheesecake Factories all over the country and this was by far the worst service. Seating experience wasn't good and it took over an hour to get our food after we ordered.
