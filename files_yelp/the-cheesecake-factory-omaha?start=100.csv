Gregg S.,"Omaha, NE",1,77,73,2.0,3/7/2015,"Note:  it appears they do not wipe the tables between seatings. It was my experience that they removed the used dishes and replaced with clean dishes, without wiping down the table. This is true of the tables that were to the left of me and the right of me."
Jade H.,"Omaha, NE",11,52,3,4.0,2/27/2015,"I've never been here before but my bf said it was a good place and he wasn't joking! They have everything!! I have never seen a place with so many diverse food choices. The only thing is that it is a little pricey for my liking. The food was, however amazing. I had the little crab cake bites and a house salad and I tried my bf's pretzel chicken and it was great. (Wish I had ordered that instead of my salad though lol) The dipping sauces where also very good and the service was great! Even with them being super busy we got our food and drinks in a timely manner. The waiter was also very pleasant and helpful.   I will definitely go back."
Mary K.,"Omaha, NE",0,81,,4.0,10/17/2015,The menu is huge.  Almost too many choices.  I ordered spaghetti and meatballs and it was delicious.  We ordered garlic cheese bread and it also was very good.  What I didn't like was the cheesecake.  It was mediocre and at $8 a slice I expected much more.  This is my first time eating here and because the food was so good I would eat there again but I would skip the cheesecake.
Natedoglara ..,"Sioux City, IA",0,1,1,3.0,4/24/2014,"Started with 2 cokes, got the fish tacos which I received 4, I did 2 fried and 2 grilled fish. They were good but need extra tortilla on each soaked right through and made mess. Gf had the chicken Alfredo tasted really good, recommend small portion. Got cheese cake white chocolate raspberry truffle not as good as dutch apple last time. she got cookies and cream not as good as peanut butter cup. water was OK, didn't check back many times. bill was $58 plus tip. food from $9.99-$25.99 cheesecake $7.50 a slice. many things $9.99-$14.99."
Antonio O.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,7,1,3.0,10/1/2014,The host should not have that work position as a employee.  She was there like a mute not even smile.  I know that's rude for any client and bad for the company because I have a business too
Brittany H.,"Omaha, NE",3,17,,5.0,12/18/2014,"I just have to say the management and staff here were awesome!  I wanted to surprise my boyfriend for his birthday last night and they completely helped me do that.  Miguel, supervisor, had my table ready to go at 7 with a bottle of wine and the balloons I brought in and the service was fantastic!  The food was spot on and the night was amazing.  I couldn't have thanked them anymore for accommodating what I wanted."
Derek S.,"Reno, NV",3,69,227,3.0,5/22/2011,"I've always been a fan of the cheesecake factory.  You know going in that you are gonna get a huge meal that is totally unhealthy, but delicious.  Some of my personal favorites are the barbeque ranch chicken salad, any of the burgers and the cuban sandwich.  The salad is actually big enough to share and loaded with enough toppings to the last bite, but they could go a little easier on the dressing amount.  Probably my new favorite is the cuban, just fantastic and perfectly prepared with great taste, tender meat and just the right amount of sauce. Everything on the menu tends to be worth the money, but then again you are paying a little more for the portion sizes and experience.  The wait staff was friendly, but a little slow.  They never offered extra bread and actually could have come by more often, especially at the end of the meal."
Ben K.,"Portland, OR",62,299,,1.0,10/15/2009,"Pros: Dessert is good Cons: Everything else I remember my parents calling me all excited when they found out Cheesecake Factory was finally opening a location in Omaha. ""We're finally on the map!"" Okay, maybe it isn't THAT spectacular, but people in my hometown took the news as if the second coming of Christ arrived. I've eaten at Cheesecake Factories everywhere, and have always had one question: Why do so many people love this place? I can't stand it. Every location is way too busy (even in cities with strong restaurant scenes like Seattle, Dallas and Chicago), it's too loud, there's nowhere to sit, you feel rushed, it's overpriced, the menu is expansive, which is always a warning flag for me as they make many things but specialize in none, they give you way too much to eat and it had a bland, boring atmosphere to it. The Omaha location isn't any different. Omahans LOVE chains, which disturbs me as more chains are taking over from the charming local restaurants that I used to love in my hometown. Do yourself a favor: skip this place and give your money to one of the local restaurants out there."
Cmh H.,"Omaha, NE",9,105,3,2.0,1/13/2012,"We were there around 3 mos. ago and the service took foreverrr. It looked like our server had 2 entire sections to contend with. All told, I think we were there for a late lunch for about 2 hrs. Totally ridiculous. I'm sure some of it was due to a delay in the kitchen.   The club sandwich is good, but huge, so if you are not going home right away, then what do you do with all the leftovers? You can't leave turkey sit in a warm car while you go out and about. Tried again today, having the Fish & Chips. The breading was barely crisp on the outside, all soggy in the middle and seriously, there was barely any fish inside the 4 pieces for lunch sized portion. Fries were average, coleslaw a little waxy tasting. Ordered a bowl of clam chowder soup, an extra $4.98. For the quality of my meal, I could have gone to Arthur Treachers or Village Inn for much less money. Strike that, just pick up some frozen fish sticks from Walmart and you'd have the same quality. Server seemed more preoccupied with chatting with staff elsewhere at the front counters. I wish I could have whistled loud enough to get his attention to call him over. Took forever to get the soup to the table (brought by a different employee finally), and then our server brought my meal out a minute later. He only had two tables to attend to, so not sure why he couldn't have checked back at the proper times. He also seemed to really not care about if my meal was okay or not, he seemed to rush past (to do what, I have no clue). His tip reflected his attitude. I think Cheesecake Factory needs to do better to get my business. We are not going to go out of our way to eat here and spend $50 on lunch again. Red Velvet Cheesecake is quite good, but was a bit on the dry side, so wonder if it was fresh or what. Avoid the fish & chips and as far as service, just hope for the best. Update: upon emailing corporate and giving feedback, they kindly passed my remarks along and I did receive a gift card in the mail. I'm pleased that corporate does care about the feedback they are receiving in regard to the menu."
Chris S.,"Omaha, NE",29,15,,4.0,9/12/2012,"My Friends and I went there, as a diebetic I will admit it was a bad place for me to go... could have easily killed myself there ;0) Ordered a nice pasta dish that came out in a huge plate admittedly it was like $17, but we all ordered something we wanted and then we got several plates and shared the portions were large enough to make that a great way to try lots of stuff. The food all of it was good I'll admit to having better else where, but it was still good. Then came the deserts! Again we all order what we wanted and they were large enough to share with 4 people.... white chocolate musse cheesecake.... chocolate mint cheesecake.... white chocolate macodamia nut cookie cheesecake?..... and the BOMB Red Velvet Cack Cheesecake!!!!!!   If for no other reason go there for the desert!!!!!!! I could have put myself in a coma and been happy to be there!"
Kate A.,"Omaha, NE",0,1,,2.0,6/14/2015,The service was not good. Four of us received our food at the same time but one person sat 5 minutes without their meal. No apologizes or anything. And it was inedible. Way over priced! Maybe cut down selections so you can spend more time on serving quality food!
Niccole M.,"Omaha, NE",32,265,2,5.0,12/12/2012,"I just don't even care if this is a corporation. I love it. Orange chicken, yes. Avocado roles, yes. Just all of it, yes. Maybe one thing could change: the prices. If I am going to die without it, I usually go when its the brunch menu."
Shawn G.,"Omaha, NE",27,163,41,2.0,10/10/2011,"Nothing to see here, folks.  I've come here with friends and/or family three times, and on all three occasions I left disappointed. The corny yet elegant atmosphere, association with cheese-cake, and high prices lead you to believe that your meal here will be decadent and bursting with flavor. Unfortunately, everything I've eaten here has been just the opposite. Bland, flavorless, forgettable...  The cheesecake is alright, but nothing extravagant, and definitely nothing to write home about.  If I was just rating on the basis of the quality of the meals I've had, I'd give this place one star. However, many of the meals come in massive portions, the design of the dining room is pretty neat (though childish), and most of my friends and family have been satisfied with their food, so they limp into a second star. My suggestion to Cheesecake Factory would be to focus less on offering a hundred bad meals and more on offering a dozen or two good ones."
Doug B.,"La Vista, NE",4,30,16,2.0,2/23/2014,"The Cheesecake Factory use to be one of my favorite restaurants. The problem is that the menu is so huge that many items are dumped and replaced with new entrees. I have had so many favorite dishes in the past, but most are now gone! I was currently unimpressed with my last two trips because the new entrees only left me wanting some of my old favorites. Maybe, the Cheesecake Factory should sell the retired recipes in a cookbook because they are going to need the revenue growth someday soon! I can remember when people waited in line for almost an hour to be seated at this restaurant. Days gone by...... I would be interested in hearing other people mention a recipe that has been retired and is missed!"
Jerome B.,"Alexandria, VA",43,89,11,1.0,7/10/2011,"I love the cheesecake factory... but this one sucks.  Poor service, and food seemed off!  How do you mess up SHRIMP?!   It wasnt peak time - there was no wait to be seated... plenty of empty tables.  Yet it took me about 10 minutes to get a menu, another 15 to get water and bread.  WTF Its a shame - because normally I love this place to eat; I guess not in Omaha is the lesson I learned."
Kevin M.,"Omaha, NE",5,20,49,1.0,3/18/2015,"Terrible, terrible and terrible. The only reason I would except this one to have one star is that the server was nice. The tables wee losing there varnish and the copper at the end of the table had never been polished. The interior was pretty lovely. My wife and I ordered two cocktails that tasted like the juice was really old. The Ahi Tartare was frozen tuna, don't eat AHI hear if you like AHI!  The Da Vinci pasta was made with really cheap penne. The chicken was bland. The Calabrian pizza slices fell downwards after grabbing a slice to take a bite. What really stood out was the wild mushroom soup. I couldn't help but have this taste in my mouth of uncleaned mushrooms. I could not taste anything else even when I tried to wash it out of my mouth. Looking around I did notice that other customers were leaving food almost untouched on there plates. There will be no reason to come back here again."
Boomer K.,"Omaha, NE",0,3,,1.0,2/3/2016,"This is the worst Cheesecake Factory I've ever been to.  First time we went it was a Tuesday night, not busy at all as we were our waiter's only table that night, and it took us over an hour and a half to have appetizers, drinks, and cheesecake.  We were both left thinking the service was super slow, it took 20 minutes to get our cheesecake after ordering it, again it was not busy at all and the cheesecake is already made so they weren't making us a new cheesecake after our order.  We got some gift cards for this place a couple of years later and decided to try it again.  This time we went on a Saturday night knowing it would be a little wait (server told us 30 minutes) we decided to get a drink and sit outside while we waited...44 minutes later our buzzer buzzed and we went to get a table.  Again the service was extremely slow, took over 40 minutes to get our order (1 bacon burger and 1 pasta salad) which I think is way too long even though they were busy, then we decided to get a piece of cheesecake to go, again this took about 20 minutes just to get the cheesecake.  Even our waiter asked if the manager had stopped by to apologize for the wait but he never came by.  Overall, we will never go here again, food was just ok, service was terrible, very unsatisfied after two separate attempts to give this place a try."
Jim L.,"Bay St. Louis, MS",15,138,12,2.0,8/25/2011,"Really, how can they take so many delightful ingredients and beat all the flavor out of them?  It's not terrible, I admit.  It just doesn't seem to be much of anything at all.  I've eaten there twice, and that was once too many.  My family shares bites all around, so we get to taste what everyone's having.  The verdict was unanimous: bland, uninspiring food, not worth the time or the money.  And you can get better-tasting cheesecake over at Whole Foods."
Samantha G.,"Omaha, NE",5,4,,4.0,1/22/2014,"Although I prefer to support locally owned restaurants, we were given a gift card for Christmas.  The service was excellent and our entrees were delicious.  Not a fan of the side salad I ordered and will forego it in the future.  My fiancé's Chicken Costoletta was delicious and enough for two meals.  I had the best Fish and Chips I have ever had in Nebraska...again enough for two meals!"
Sarah G.,"Omaha, NE",56,989,1408,2.0,4/24/2009,"I'm waffling between giving two or three stars.  Typically I don't like to review chain restaurants at all because they're all pretty consistent and you know what you're getting (or at least you should) when you go there.  But last night at the cheesecake factory I remembered a couple of reasons why I don't typically eat there. The cheesecake is obviously 3 or 4 stars in quality, but it costs $9.  I'm pretty sure I could buy the ingredients to make a whole cheesecake at home for that price.   The dirty martini I ordered (which our server said the bartender described as 'extra dirty) was also $9.  The blue cheese stuffed olives that are listed as part of the drink on the menu... I had to ask for after it showed up without them.  Plus, 'extra dirty'?  Really?  The irony here is that it may sound cute, but the 'dirty' is the olive juice... so you put extra olive juice in my martini?  Thanks, but no thanks.  You can just make it extra-ginny instead. The food is always good, nothing to write home about.  And the portions lend themselves to excessive eating.  I've never been absolutely disappointed with a meal here, until I get the check. I probably would have gone with the three stars if I didn't feel like they were holding me by my ankles to shake out all the loose change in my pockets.  All told, one martini, one dinner and one piece of cheesecake to go set me back $37.  I can think of far more fabulous places to spend that money in town."
