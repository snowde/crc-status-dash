Corey W.,"Lincoln, NE",0,4,,2.0,6/16/2015,Went to the Cheesecake Factory over the weekend. It was busy probably because of the College World Series. It took 45 minutes to get our food. The manager stopped by our table and apologized for the delay and only offered us more bread!!! I felt we should have been offered a discount on the meal or on some cheesecake. I wasn't overly impressed with the food for the price. I mostly like won't go back.
Susan S.,"Chicago, IL",1,20,10,2.0,11/21/2013,"Not impressed with this location. Slow service. Took server a long time to return to the table after each request. Salty and greasy food. Had to send back my appetizer because it was burned. Manager did come out to apologize so that was good. Please re-visit your recipes. The lettuce wraps were too saucy, skimpy on the meat, and very salty."
Nathan B.,"Churdan, IA",25,54,81,3.0,2/22/2012,"Okay, do not get me wrong...I am a BIG Cheesecake Factory fan!  I love the West Des Moines, Iowa location with all my heart.  I know what I like and I do not care what people who think they're ""foodies"" who rely on only local restaurants think.  If you're so cross that you think you too good to eat at huge, clean, beautiful Cheesecake Factory, and would rather eat at some rat trap local restaurant instead (not all local restaurants are like that, but I'm just giving an example if you went there and it was run down and dirty), be my guest (actually, don't be). THAT said, I've been to several Cheesecake Factory locations, and this one was clean and nice looking like the others, but for Omaha's size, it was WAY too small.  The waiting area and the bakery area were consolidated into one area, making it very difficult for employees to wafer through the crowds with cheesecake for the bakery.  The waiting area itself is extremely small, and not enough seating was available for our wait (it didn't matter to me, but to someone who is disabled or can't stand for long periods of time, it would be).   Just on a side note: This was the first Cheesecake Factory that I've been to that is freestanding, and not connected to a plaza or major super regional mall. Once we were seated (we were quoted 15, and it ended up being 45...minus one star), the waiter promptly brung us bread (wheat is the best!) and took our order.  Me and the boyfriend's meals were perfect!  Had my usual Pasta Da Vinci with extra extra shrimp (overpriced, but awesome) and extra mushrooms, and had key lime cheesecake for dessert.   Customer service great...one star.  Decor...very nice...one star.  Food...awesome as always...one star.  No fourth or fifth star because of the small waiting area and the extensive waiting time to be seated. We arrived at 5PM on a Saturday evening, and boy was it busy!  Please plan ahead when deciding to come here during peak times.   Personally, I think The Cheesecake Factory would have been more appropriate to be built out by Village Pointe (or Regency Court), where upscale shopping is key.  Westroads Mall is the largest mall in Omaha (and all of Nebraska, for that matter), but not the nicest.  But I can't help that...thank you!"
Randy K.,"Stevensville, MI",3,5,,2.0,10/23/2010,"Food is average at best. Dessert was good, but as usual, expensive.  Our waitress was Angela. She had to be hyped up on 3-4 cups of coffee. One of the pushiest people I've ever met. She: - spilled my drink twice. - never brought anything to clean up these drinks.  I had to use napkins. I never got a new one.    - never let us finish what we were saying when answering one of her questions, or making a request.  - took my dinner plate away without asking, and I wasn't anywhere close to done.  It got to the point where it was laughable. However, it gives me all the more reason not to go back to this chain.  Should have stuck with my instincts.  Good luck"
Shelly T.,"Omaha, NE",15,26,,1.0,9/26/2011,"I was not impressed with this place.  It was busy and it was beautiful but my impressions dropped off from there. I ordered a house salad but never actually tasted any salad dressing (thousand isaland) on it...it was bland... My son had a pizza...it was dry..I didn't see any sauce, we had to order marinara sauce so that he could choke it down...The burger my daughter ordered was unimpressive... My waitress while friendly and efficient was almost stepford like...I got the impression it was the ""cheesecake way"".. she was suppposed to act...I would have preferred casual and friendly... I don't think this is one of those ""one time bad expreriences"" I think it was business as usual for this place.."
Eric And Jennifer R.,"Austin, TX",16,618,37,4.0,11/6/2013,I love everything I get from any Cheesecake Factory.  This location has good service and designed for families with children.
Ashley M.,"Omaha, NE",0,11,,4.0,9/19/2012,"amazing ranch. unique recipe, lots of garlic.  don't buy it in the bottle though, it doesn't keep well."
Ashleigh F.,"Kingman, AZ",24,8,,2.0,10/20/2013,We recently moved to Nebraska and were hanging out in Omaha for the day and decided on The Cheesecake Factory for lunch. The menu was huge but we decided on the Renee' lunchspecial or something like that. The food was good and we ordered 2 pieces of cheesecake to go because they looked good. The ones served in the restaurant to people around us were huge and seemingly worth the $8. BUT when we got home we were incredibly disappointed because the size of the slice was probably half the size of the ones served in the restaurant but they were still $8!!!! Totally ridiculous! Probably won't be coming back.
Aaron T.,"Philadelphia, NY",28,371,136,2.0,5/27/2012,"I ordered the lemon chicken with mushrooms. I forget the name, but it was really good. The sauce went great with the noodles. However, my wife had the other chicken special and it was extremely bland. No taste at all and was cold. We sent it back and the manager came over and apologized. Then we got the billed and noticed the waiter ordered me the huge $17 diner plate vs the $11 lunch special, which was the main purpose we went in for lunch. But it was too late, and didn't even feel like talking to them about it. The cheesecake was exceptionally well though, highly recommend that even if your full. This place upset our visit here."
Ryan M.,"Omaha, NE",58,279,1,2.0,1/19/2008,"My first experience with Cheesecake Factory was back in Seattle, and I could never understand how in a city with such fantastic restaurant options, people would wait more than an hour for marginal food.  The popularity in Omaha is completely out of whack with the food and experience, and I wish I had an explanation as to why people flock here in droves.  I have the following theories: 1) Good Housekeeping had an article that eating at this place cures female fertility problems. 2) They have a secret menu for Republicans that's a massive improvement over their menu for everyone else. 3) People with children eat for free. Otherwise, I can't explain why this place is so popular and also so mediocre and overpriced."
Kim J.,"Omaha, NE",63,328,230,4.0,1/19/2008,"Like Daniel said, the menu here is expansive.  I think the waitron told us there was something like over 100 menu items.  I will admit, I have stayed away from this place.  Generally, I am against large chainstyle restaurants.  When I have traveled to Chicago or KC, I remember friends saying, ""you've got to eat at Cheesecake Factory"" and me thinking, right, I'm not going to that place.  We went simply because my husband had received a gift card.  I wasn't excited but Ifigured it was a free meal.  It took me forever to decide what to get.   I finally decided on CHICKEN MADEIRA, their  Most Popular Chicken Dish (Sauteed Chicken Breast Topped with Fresh Asparagus and Melted Mozzarella Cheese, Covered with Fresh Mushroom Madeira Sauce.  Served with Mashed Potatoes).  THe portion size was huge. THe taste was wonderful.  I loved it.  Very much comfort food.  We also had the Spicy Ahi Tempura Rolls, which sounded really different and we really like them.  I think I could go there and get just appetizers, there are so many that sound good.   My husband had the Navajo sandwich which comes on fry bread.  I had a taste and it was good.   We were SOOOO full by the huge portions (and I took half of mine home) that we were too full for dessert.  We'll have to go back for cheesecake sometime."
Gary K.,"Papillion, NE",3,48,10,4.0,12/10/2009,"I am shocked to see so many people having poor experiences at the Cheesecake Factory.  Wow, this place has good food & a huge menu!  In fact, of the two times we've been, I have been shocked at the fantastic food.  I usually go before prime hours and not on weekends and even then, service sometimes lags a bit but never to the point of being mad.  The prices are a bit high but I have no problem with it based on the huge portions and fantastic food.  I have to believe that the poor ratings were for dining during peak periods when service was stretched and maybe food was prepared through shortcuts. Overall: HUGE menu, really good food, interesting atmosphere, slow service, long waits during peak times."
Laura K.,"Philadelphia, NY",9,109,,1.0,5/28/2012,"Bland..bland...bland. Cheesecake Factory...where has your quality gone???!! From the salad to the entree, I was highly unimpressed. We actually sent my entree back because it was very bland, cold, and left a disgusting taste in my mouth. I think I had the same entree (chicken romano) a few years ago and it was very good. Very disappointed. Will not come back here again to pay $40 for a very bland, cold lunch. It appears chains are really starting to get worse. I hope this gives our small, family owned resturants a chance to break from the overpowering shadows of the massive amounts of chain resturants."
Michelle G.,"Omaha, NE",49,404,2,4.0,3/31/2015,"lets just start off by saying I loved the Overland Park KS Cheesecake Factory, when I lived nearby I was there often. over the span of ten years well.. I loved them. the servers knew me. I know people think Kansas City is a food town and they are, they have too much processed food for me now that I went organic and I had to be careful of my places I went.  Cheesecake Factory was fresh enough and I just wasn't going to give them or my cheesecake- up.  since the Omaha one i haven't tried yet,  I decided to try them and sit at the bar for lunch today. first.. the Omaha Factory looks exactly like Overland Park so I was immediately at home. the bartender was sweet yet efficient and didn't tarry getting me my check/order/food.. I respect that they honor people at lunch like that..  second.. they won my approval by giving me a dish not a tiny cup for my tex mex eggrolls avocado crème. it gets tiring having to ask all the time for a second one to dip. I had plenty.   the eggrolls were delicious. I can't wait to come back and test out some of the menu items I've been wanting to try..  awesome!"
Pamela R.,"Austin, TX",1,173,,3.0,4/15/2011,"What can you say about Cheesecake Factory? If you've been to one, you've been to them all. There was no wait for a table and the food arrived quickly. This location was a lot less busy than the one on Michigan Ave. in Chicago. I ordered the Baja Tacos with the black beans and rice. The fish was a llittle bland, but the beans and rice were tasty. My grandmother ordered the fried shrimp and they were really good. The keylime cheesecake is yummy, even though I did not taste any cream cheese, it was more like keylime pudding. We had two different waitresses and they were both pleasant and friendly."
Jason G.,"Overland Park, KS",164,381,84,4.0,10/16/2011,great service.  great dessert.
A.J. G.,"Ankeny, IA",0,20,,4.0,12/13/2011,"I don't know what everyone else on here is ordering, but I have never gotten bland food at The Cheesecake Factory in Omaha or anywhere else. I have tried several salads, a burger, club sandwich, meat sauce spaghetti, and the alfredo; none of them were bland although I wasn't super impressed with the alfredo. It is expensive but you get massive portions. My family likes to try everyone else's food when we eat out so this is a plus for us. The cheesecake is amazing if you have room for it.  My only complaint about the place is their ridiculous alcoholic drink prices. I went there by myself after shopping one afternoon and spent close to $30 on 3 drinks......wtf. They don't list the prices in the drink menu and they really aren't that great. I had their red sangria and it was decent, but not worth $9 a glass. Also the service seems to be either amazing or leaving you wonder if they are hiring randoms leaving the mall."
P H.,"Omaha, NE",0,12,,2.0,1/18/2014,"Made my once a year trip to Cheesecake Factory to see if they have returned the Thai Steak Salad to their menu.  No such luck. This was the best salad ever in any restaurant and was my reason for eating there. It was great...on an expansive menu, for some reason ....probably because it was really good...they dropped it. So today, no Thai steak Salad. The service was so sloooow. I've seen tree sloths with more raw speed. Mediocre nachos with weird chicken and the jalapeños were just the ends of the peppers...the part you are supposed to throw away. Took an hour to get nachos and meatloaf. The tea was good. Took home two very small slices of cheesecake. Bring back the Thai Steak Salad...best thing that used to be on your menu."
Karen B.,"Omaha, NE",1,16,,1.0,12/23/2010,"Good cheesecake, but twice I've gone there just to pick up a cheesecake to go and it took about 20 minutes each time. Not sure why it takes so long.  Another time a few friends and I ordered appetizers to share. I ordered the potstickets. We got 5 potstickers that were not much bigger or thicker than a quarter and it cost$9.95! Ridiculous! Large selection, but a bit on the expensive side fir what you get."
Shawn T.,"Omaha, NE",0,4,1,4.0,5/18/2012,"I've been a few times now, the service has been good usually very busy. Good food love the cheesecake!! Great portion sizes for the money."
