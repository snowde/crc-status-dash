Tracie K.,"Gretna, NE",0,5,,1.0,3/8/2014,Worst 12.95 chicken sandwich i have ever had...my husband ordered a burger and it was small...portions horrible...and we did not choose to order a 7.95 piece of any desert(outrageous price)...the service was below below belowwwwwwwww average...no refills on water and the server asked as he was walking bye how is everything(serious were you addressing me) or the person next to me...but then who would know the two top tables are so close together. He left the bread plates on the table...poor very poor service....will I return to this establishment not even with a gift certificate.
Patrick W.,"Bennington, NE",45,441,19,4.0,7/25/2010,"I know the reputation of this place (especially on this board) but I don't care.  I like it.  Now I've never had a great meal here but I've never had a bad one either.  For the most part, the food is somewhere between average and good and they're consistent.  This is a great place if you're with a large group and you can't agree on where to go.  There's tons of choices and something to satisfy just about anyone.  Recently, I tried the Morning Quesadilla and it was enjoyable.  It was huge and full of scrambled eggs, cheese, black beans, peppers, cilantro, bacon in a tortilla served with a side of pico de gallo, sour cream, and guacamole.  It is the perfect meal for the morning after a late night at the bar.  It's even better when sitting outside when the weather is nice.  And while I enjoy the ambiance, it can be loud, and hurried.  Personally, I can't speak for the cheesecakes because I don't like 'em but the Carrot Cake is darn good."
Alexis J.,"Omaha, NE",2,44,,3.0,9/3/2011,I thought I would try it out. One of my girl friends was just bragging about it. Personally I thought the food was ok and the service the same. The price for the quality of food seemed high to me. At least the dessert was good.
Daniel A.,"Mebane, NC",14,163,15,5.0,2/17/2007,"The thing about the Cheesecake Factory is its expansive menu.  They have a menu that reads like an encyclopedia of food.  When coupled with a nice new building and a good staff this is a great place to go when you do not know what you want to eat, but want something good. Imagine Leonardo Da Vinci as a chef, he would work at the Cheesecake Factory."
Ryan P.,"Bennington, NE",0,1,,5.0,9/19/2012,Every dish I have tried has been excellent. By far my favorite restaurant. If you go request a booth otherwise you will be banging elbows with strangers... Unless you are into that type of thing.
D C.,"Omaha, NE",23,52,9,4.0,5/13/2010,"It's cheesecake factory. Huge menu, from orange chicken, to pasta, to steaks to burgers, it's here. Everything is a big portion and tasty. And of course the cheesecake is 5 stars."
Charles G.,"Omaha, NE",4,130,,2.0,7/19/2008,"The Kmart of food.  As chains go, I've had worse, but this place is grossly overpriced.  The fact that anyone would spend that kind of money in there instead of patronizing any number of very good local restaurants for half the price boggles my mind."
Brian F.,"Boulder, CO",0,10,5,3.0,3/19/2012,"The Cheesecake Factory is decent chain restaurant that offers both extensive dinner and dessert menus. The price is right (on most items) and the atmosphere is reminiscent of Disney World. There's something here for everybody. Service is mediocre, expect to be here a good hour or more."
Bethany K.,"Omaha, NE",3,33,,1.0,6/21/2010,"Okay, don't get me wrong on this.  The only reason I would ever step foot in this restaurant again would be to pick up a piece of cheesecake.  But, even then, i'd probably let my husband go in and get it.  Seriously, no joke.  I loved the Macaroni Grill when it was here in Omaha, but then it disappeared and we decided to try The Cheesecake Factory.  One night is all it took to eliminate that idea.  Here's my story... My then fiance and I walked into The Cheesecake Factory.  I had to use the restroom (we'd been running errands all day, non stop).  My husband was escorted to the table.  By the time I got there and found him, the waitor had already been by to check to see if we needed drinks.  My husband told him two waters and that we would be ordering alcoholic beverages.  The waitor came back about 10 minutes later and did not have the water.  He asked if we were interested in an appetizer and I told him that I wanted to order an alcoholic beverage.  He stared at me blankly and so I asked him a recommendation for their wine selection.  He gave me an evil stare and then turned around and said, oh my god, and turned back around and stared at me blankly.  Of course my husband and I looked at each other like there was something wrong with him.  I then snapped at him and told him that I wanted a double shot of jack and coke and handed him over my identification.  He grabbed it from me and hurt my hand.  Then he threw my ID back onto the table (the small plastic card bounced about 4 inches off of the table, I swear), then he turned around and wandered over to the other tables.  He was nice and polite to everyone else.  He was laughing and giddy with everyone.  Everytime my husband or I made eye contact with him, he made mean faces and it truly looked like he wanted to rape me and hit my husband, it was sick.  I then thought back to my dating experiences.  Maybe I'd dated the guy?  Um... NOPE!  I had never seen him before in my life.  My husband swears he'd never seen him before in his life.  The guy comes back with our water (this is 25 minutes after we were originally seated).  Not once does he try to upsell anything.  Not once does this man say more than a single word at one time to our faces.    Not once does he smile.  Not once does he say have a nice day, NOTHING.  My food was cold, which means he waited too long to bring it out.  My drink was watery, which means he waited too long to bring it out.  Yuck.  The second worst experience of my life. I repeatedly told my husband that we needed to leave and request a complimentary gift card or something.  He's like... just be patient.  I love my patient husband, but seriously?  I think not. I walked right up to the manager after the dinner and told him everything that happened.  He told the cheesecake counter to get us two free pieces of cheesecake of our choice and that he was sorry for the inconvenience.  I watched him, and not once did he ever approach the bad waitor we had.  I've been in the business long enough to know that if a manager does not request to speak with an employee on the double about an issue, that he never will.  It's just sad. THIS WAS NOT THE FIRST TIME THAT HAPPENED TO ME (weird), it was the 2nd.  Both people were from different parts of town and worked in different restaurants and were different genders and different personality types.  There was no way that these people knew me or new each other.  WEIRD!! Omaha has the worst service. I have a theory on why I was treated like crap.  The waitor thought that I was my fiance's daughter (my husband looks much older than I am).  He assumed that I was under age.  He assumed that because I was in the bathroom when he came by that I was going to take forever to look at the menu.  He assumed that because it was a father daughter date that we wouldn't be spending that much... or maybe it was because I was wearing jeans with my button up blouse, who knows.  In future though, I bet that butthead gets fired at every job he has."
Michael H.,"Omaha, NE",9,60,70,1.0,1/19/2008,I can't believe the masses go to this joke.  1 hour wait and overpriced food.
soylentgreen s.,"Council Bluffs, IA",4,31,,2.0,6/25/2007,"I fail to see the allure of this place- the food is ok, but not great. I suppose if you were traveling and wanted something familiar, this ""upscale chain"" would fill the bill, but I certainly can't see this as a destination restaurant."
Michael B.,"Bellevue, NE",0,42,,5.0,4/28/2007,"Although we have not had a meal here, this is an excellent place to go have dessert.  We had the tiramisu cheesecake, and it was excellent, and everyone in our party thoroughly enjoyed their dessert.  The cost for my wife and I to have coffee and cheesecake was about 25.00, so a little pricey for dessert, but I feel as though it was worth it."
Sigmund S.,"Omaha, NE",0,3,4,2.0,2/2/2011,"this place used to a lot more budget and quality friendly. my girlfriend and i thought we'd go there to split some fish and chips. we were disappointed. they serve less fish now and they cook it differently, plus i think the price went up. fish didn't taste as good, but we still like the atmosphere, next time I'll drink more so i don't have to think about the lower food quality"
