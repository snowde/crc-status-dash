Nina B.,"Omaha, NE",224,63,220,4.0,12/20/2015,Cheesecake Factory never disappoints. Their complimentary bread is always enjoyable. I like going during lunch so I can get the smaller portions for a lower cost. The pastas have never failed to disappoint. I got the Cajun jambalaya and my friend got the spicy chicken chipotle pasta. Both looked amazing! Lastly the atmosphere is pretty nice however it can be a bit odd when they sit you in the row of tables that seat two each. You are sitting close enough to have a convo with the next table.
Yurika M.,"Omaha, NE",34,40,172,2.0,3/18/2015,"Only the service and interior gets the star but was not for the silver wears, food nor drinks. Wild mushroom soup tasted really wild! It tasted like they use the mushrooms that's been in the fridge for longer than 3 days and they just picked the mushrooms out there and use it for the soup I ordered without washing them at all. Pizza tasted like nothing but salami. (Why!?lol) Pasta was blunt... Disappointing event for my birthday..."
Alyssa P.,"Upper Marlboro, MD",587,630,1568,4.0,7/29/2014,Had the salmon salad...they give SO MUCH food and it was cooked and seasoned really well. BUT the avocado rolls are OUT OF THIS WORLD!! They are SOOO DELISH!!! So fresh. They give you a good helping of avocado in each roll. The dipping sauce was outstanding! I use to love this place and then it went down hill... and I gave up on chain restaurants. A friend wanted to go here... so we did. And I am glad I gave them another try... it has been about 3 or 4 years since my previous visit! They have improved. It was outstanding. The bartender was very nice as well...
Genevieve W.,"Ankeny, IA",110,674,821,4.0,1/11/2015,"For someplace called The Cheesecake Factory I would expect the best cheesecake I have ever had, blow your mind. It was good. But expensive!! Red velvet was a little squishy. Service was decent. Stopped in for just desert. Water was brought out fairly quick. But service was not over the top either!  The restaurant was  clean and well kept.  Overall decent experience. But not what I expected!! Cheesecake was good but not the best ever!! But very good!"
D H.,"Pensacola, FL",0,4,,2.0,7/21/2017,Ate at the bar.  Drinks were good but the food is mediocre at best.  Whoever cooked the Steak Diane needs to be retrained.
Reid R.,"Omaha, NE",141,237,224,2.0,6/22/2015,"So far been sitting a while waiting for our host...place isn't too busy must not communicate well.  Now they are bussing a table ... three more walked by all talking to each other and Im still sitting here oh she finally stopped couldn't hear a word she said ... ""blah blah blah"" this place needs an adult around to manage all these kids.  We sat where there were 6 spots only needed three they took the extra silverware after I touched it then she touched it and put it back in with the clean silverware and I just witnessed another waiter grabbing said silverware and putting it on table next to us.... and I just had my hand down my pants Im 37 years old and never tasted tea that tasted like sweat tea that wasn't... then my tea sat there empty my girls half way empty they filled hers and left mine.... not sure am I jinxing myself because I yelp   not impressed"
Cynthia K.,"La Vista, Omaha, NE",9,9,2,5.0,1/11/2017,"Great food , extensive menu , serves the absolute best cheesecake with courteous service and an atmosphere that's hard to beat within budget ..."
Jessica F.,"Omaha, NE",59,31,30,4.0,6/27/2015,"If you love a huge variety of cheesecake this is definitely the place for you. If you get overwhelmed by large menus, stick the the cheesecake. Their menu is so absolutely huge it's ridiculous and almost impossible to pick any one thing from it.  On our visit today, we were seated almost as soon as we walked in the door(on a Saturday) and our waitress came shortly after we sat down. She was extremely pleasant and courteous and we got our cheesecakes fairly quickly, considering the bakery had just seen a huge rush.  Overall, I was satisfied with the food as well as the service!"
Jose G.,"Denver, CO",3,19,2,1.0,11/25/2016,"We visit here frequently because its usual a decent chain in Omaha however today are visit was horrible! Service was horrible!!! No bread was served, menus left on the table, drinks left untitled and quite frankly she forgot about us !  We waited a hour to finally get our food (keep in mind place was empty) when we finally got our food they had forgotten things, food was cold and not good!! So we waited a hour for this! Brought it to the mangers attention and it seemed he could care less! Not a good way to run a business! We will not be back better service at chick fil a !!"
Maggie M.,"Omaha, NE",243,114,109,4.0,3/18/2016,Menu meant for all is the nickname that I like to give the Cheesecake Factory. I really enjoy the skinny menu and the gluten free menu. I had the skinny girl Mexican salad with a light dressing drizzle. The salad was an extremely large portion like normal salads at cheesecake but made for perfect leftovers for lunch the next day.
Rebecca P.,"Omaha, NE",33,7,2,1.0,1/16/2016,"I am always hearing how good their food is, and how big their slices of cheesecake are, but honestly? I can make a cheesecake myself for far less. My husband and I received a gift card for Christmas and decided to do car side to go, I was on hold for 15 min and then waited another 15 min for my 3 slices of cheesecake to be ready. I went inside just to get it done with, it was so full in there and the employees looked frantic and run down.  If you like loud, over-crowded, over-expensive, chain restaurants, then this is the place for you. I prefer local places."
Kim B.,"Bellevue, NE",8,36,76,4.0,2/12/2016,"Date night last Saturday! No matter what time you go, expect to wait at least 30 minutes. We got there between 4:30-5 pm and it was still a full dinner rush. It's worth the wait, though! Our server, Brandon P., provided excellent service!! The guacamole appetizer (made spicy) is the BEST GUACOMOLE! I have said before it is the best guacamole in the world ;-) Not necessary what you think of at the Cheesecake Factory, but it is absolutely delicious.  Oddly enough, I'm giving it only 4 stars because I haven't found a cheesecake I like yet. I generally love cheesecake at any other restaurant, but I haven't found one here that I have enjoyed enough to finish or take home. I realize I'm probably the odd one out by saying that... I'll keep trying!"
Rayray J.,"Bellevue, Omaha, NE",15,36,32,4.0,1/4/2015,"It was the third time today to try Cheesecake Factory since we moved to Omaha. Service: Servers are always smiling and welcoming, good listeners and decisive when asked for recommendations, although specifically as for tonight, the side dish of appetizer was forgotten. Food: Highly recommend the Crispy Crab Bites and Fish Taco, of course, the Mousse Chocolate Cheesecake -- foogasm-awesome, everybody should eat it~! Buffalo Chicken Strips were too salty... I mean, salty-my-ass-off kinda salty, yet the Shrimp Angel Hair was a little bit too bland."
Patsy K.,"Omaha, NE",0,81,9,3.0,1/29/2017,"Came here for dinner with 3 other people  on a Saturday night at 6:30 pm with no reservations - 1 hour wait.  Line was out the door.  Against my better judgement, we decided to stay.  Finally seated.  Server was very good, but he was slammed!  He asked us to be patient - kitchen and bakery were backed up.  2 of us had Spicy Cashew Chicken, another had garlic noodles w/chicken and one had avocado/zucchini fries and another appetizer.  Food quality was fine; it was hot.  Service was good.  Dessert service was VERY slow, as the server told us it would be.  (We all ordered cheesecake, of course.)  I was not terribly impressed by the cheesecake.  I've had much better.  It was just OK.    For the prices, the food should be much better than it is.  It seems exactly like a factory, where they just shove people in, and shove people out.  Really hard to enjoy a meal there.  So noisy!  Holds 365 people, and I think they had that many there!! Just not my cup of tea for a Saturday night dinner, but it wasn't my choice that night.  I won't go back."
Alex W.,"Lindsay, NE",5,49,42,4.0,10/6/2015,"First off, I like the cheesecake factory. They have good food, and they have options for every possible picky eater. I mean picky eater to the max! Their menu is a small book, and that isn't an exaggeration. The down fall is it can take a while to decide if you aren't sure what you are in the mood for. You get warm bread while you are waiting, which is nice. You really don't need a whole appetizer its so much food. They have a good sized drink menu, but a bit pricey. Last time I was there my glass of wine was $9. A bit much for half a glass. Their portions are ridiculous. Everything I have ever ordered there comes with enough food to feed at least two people if not three. All servings are doubled if not tripled. I go home with a few meals from the left overs, which I can't complain about to much. The food is good, but honestly, its nothing special. It's average food. The cheesecake is on a whole new level, that's why I gave it 4 stars. I have never had bad cheese cake there. It is so good and there are so many choices! I usually get it to go because I'm so full from the other food! It is quite pricey for a meal, but with the serving sizes so big you do get what you pay for. The cheesecake slices aren't cheap, but oh so worth it! This isn't a place I go often at all, but when I do I splurge on the cheesecake. If you are looking for a place with a menu of choices for everyone, this is the place to go. Just don't expect to walk out wowed by the food and expect your waist line to be pushing the seams a bit! and make sure to splurge on a piece of cheesecake :)"
Lance F.,"Omaha, NE",171,326,214,2.0,8/24/2015,"The Cheesecake Factory, the place we usually go after dinner somewhere else to get a wonderful slice of cheesecake.  Never had I actually eaten a meal at a Cheesecake Factory until recently, when my son chose this as his birthday dinner spot.  We rolled in fairly early on a Friday evening and were greeted and seated right away.   To start off, we went with a couple of appetizers: a cheese garlic bread and the chicken pot stickers.  The kids enjoyed the pot stickers but the appetizer only came with five pot stickers.  This is actually a pet peeve of mine (kinda, mostly just an observation).  I cannot for the life of me figure out why restaurants serve five items on an appetizer.  Why five?  It's an odd number and the only way it really works is if you have five people in your party and really, how often does that happen? If it's a couple, the fifth one sits there until someone decides they want to be the selfish one to eat the last one.  If you have a party of three, someone loses out!  Party of four, again, one extra sitting there until whomever takes it.  Let's go with six next time, a nice round number!  It works much better.  Party of two, three a piece.  Party of three, two a piece.  Party of four, one a piece and evenly split the last two.  See how nice that works for most parties?   Anyway, sorry, back on track. The garlic cheese bread was very good.  The star of the meal, as it turns out.  For meals, my youngest son went with the kids sliders, which he took one bite of and wouldn't eat anymore.  This kid LOVES burgers, so it tells you how these tasted.  I tried it and agreed.  Not good.  The birthday boy went with the bacon cheeseburger, which was pretty good.  My wife ordered chicken fettuccine alfredo and was OK with it.  I did the catfish dinner, which came with mashed potatoes and green beans.  It was all fine but nothing stood out honestly.   The service was good.  Our server brought my son a little dessert for his birthday without doing the whole singing thing.  He just turned into a teenager, so we appreciated her discretion on the singing thing because well, he's 13 and who knows how that would have gone down.   I am torn between two and three stars overall.  The service was good (a 4 star experience) but the food left a lot to be desired.  When you spend a good chunk of money, you'd like to feel like it was a treat, you know?  Something that was memorable and worth the money.  We didn't feel that here.  It just was an overpriced, underwhelming food experience.  I'm not one of those crazy anti-chain Yelpers who detests all things chain but in this case, I can honestly say that Cheesecake Factory is a place to which I won't return for a meal.  Look for me ordering some cheesecake to go."
Doug S.,"Omaha, NE",10,107,62,1.0,7/24/2015,"No stars if I could and I haven't even got my food. Don't care how good the food may be. They say there is no call ahead seating or reservations. Yet I watched 2 parties walk in after us either the same size or larger and they were seated before us. One seemed to be buddy buddy with the hostess.  So pissed right now that if this wasn't my daughters choice to eat at, we would be gone. Last time here. Frig off Cheesecake Factory."
Brenda M.,"Tacoma, WA",0,3,,1.0,3/17/2017,"Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite places to dine however last night the wait 45 minutes just to be seated, we waited an hour for our food, and when we asked our waitress, Della did they offer a military discount, well, unfortunately they didn't offer that as well. Very disappointed!!"
Crystal C.,"Omaha, NE",0,2,4,1.0,8/23/2016,I saw a fried bug on my food. This is very disappointing. This is unsanitary!! I almost threw up!!! And felt very disgusted! Cheese Cake Factory you have failed.
Jamie L.,"San Diego, CA",44,366,480,4.0,9/26/2015,"I have only ever gotten cheesecake here, so I can't speak to their dine in menu. However, if you're ever in the mood for a giant, most of your calories for the day, slice of cheesecake, this is the place. They have a ton of different flavors and all are just as naughty. The staff vary in politeness though and sometimes they try to get skimpy on the whipped topping. I need my whipped topping dang you!"
