Mona A.,"Virginia Beach, VA",0,5,3,4.0,2/18/2016,"The service here is always friendly and helpful. Cheesecake is always always busy and you can't make a reservation after five but the wait is reasonable. Unless you go in on a holiday or weekend that's expected to be busy, the wait is worth it. I always get a pasta or rice dish every time that I've been. The staff is always helpful with choosing what is good and giving excellent recommendations. The drinks are awesome too."
Barb E.,"Omaha, NE",2,24,,2.0,12/28/2016,"This place has some serious service issues. I met my friend here at 1 pm on a Wednesday, and the restaurant was packed. (Great for them!)  My friend's in-laws were in the bar area at a table so we decided to take their table as they were just leaving. Once the table had been bused, the server brought us water and bread and butter. I asked her for silverware, assuming this would prompt her to bring us the normal table place setting (napkin, silverware, plates, salt & pepper) but she only brought silverware. We asked for napkins and plates, she only brought napkins, so she had to go back a third time for plates. My friend ordered coffee and I ordered a beer. She brought the coffee, then brought us both beer. We told her we wanted to order soup and share a couple of appetizers. She said something like ""since you are sharing soup, would you like the bowl versus the cup since it's larger?"" I had to actually explain to her that we would like our own cup of soup and we'd share the appetizers.  After a long wait, the soup came out and it was cold. It took us more than 5 minutes to flag someone down to send it back. 10 minutes later they re-served the soup which was only slightly warmer than previously. A full hour and 10 minutes after we placed our order we had still not received the two appetizers. No one had checked on us since re-serving the soup. Once again we flagged down our server and told her to cancel the order and bring us the check. She asked us to wait while she spoke to her manager. She came back with one of the two appetizers and said that her manager will waive the charge for them if we'd still like them, or they could box them up. Neither one of us planned to have an all afternoon lunch, but we decided just to stay and have some. She brought the 2nd appetizer, but no plates, we just used our tiny bread plates. It was a small table and they hadn't cleared away any of our dirty plates, glasses or the soup bowls, so I tried to stack them and get them out of our way. Eventually our server walked by and stopped, grabbed some of our dirty dishes and put them on the same tray with food she was taking to another table. I almost stopped her, but I was too shocked by what I was seeing happen! Oh, and the food? We had the eggroll sampler and the Thai chicken lettuce wraps. They were just okay. I finally got out of there at 3:25. Ridiculous!"
Chris S.,"Chatsworth, CA",255,1601,6242,3.0,9/19/2014,"I've been to a lot of Cheesecake Factory locations across the US and normally come here because of the chain's consistency. I came here rather than Granite City because normally everything you order on the menu is good and the service is excellent. While the service was as expected, the Santa Fe Salad I normally order at lunch wasn't at par with normalcy. Locating any chicken in the salad was a chore. Normally, there's so much you can't eat it all. This time I felt like I was on a quest to find it. The same went for the black beans. Meanwhile, every meal that passed by me to other tables looked great and I saw dozens of them. Unfortunately, mine was that fell short. Still, this is a great place for lunch or dinner and of course dessert. Wonderful service and a menu that gives you so many great choices it'll be a challenge to choose something."
Mike K.,"Bennington, NE",0,79,,5.0,2/13/2017,"A review from one of my eighth grade students... Pros Great food Clean  Amazing desert Reasonable hours Cons Service takes a while Waiting for a table Busy          I have had many great experiences at The Cheesecake Factory. The Food is high quality and it has great prices. I would definitely recommend if you are looking for a place to grab lunch or dinner and  dessert. They are open at reasonable hours Monday through Thursday they are open at 11:00 am- 11:00 pm, Friday and Saturday they are open from 11:00 am- 12:00 am. On Sunday they are open from 10:00 am- 10:00 pm. The prices range from $11.00 to $30.00 for most of the food items on the menu. They take reservations and its family friendly.          The longest I have ever waited for a table at the Cheesecake Factory is about fifteen to twenty minutes. The servers are nice and friendly but they can take a while to get to your table because it is always so busy. They allow reservation and they have carry out so it is great if you're lazy and you want to stop by after work and get something to eat. I would recommend the Chicken Picatta it is full of flavor and it's good if you like lemons.         Overall my experiences have always been great here the food is delicious and the environment is clean. Although it is very busy I think the food is worth the wait. The restaurant is family friendly but it is not overwhelmingly loud. The Cheesecake factory has a vast menu so there will always be something new to try. This restaurant is a great choice for any occasion. Another review from one of my 8th-grade students... Pros,  the food was good,  the building's design was realty cool  the people who worked there were really nice.   Cons,  there wasn't a lot of lighting,  confusion with the employees,    The Cheesecake Factory at Westroads mall is known for their cheesecake, hence the name. Just because it is all about cheesecake it doesn't mean that is all they serve. They have a variety of lunch and dinner items. The building is a dimly lit place with cool artwork decorating the walls. I think the restaurant is Egyptian themed but I am not sure.   When I went to The Cheesecake Factory for the first time I didn't have the best experience. I got there on a Sunday at about 3:30. It was surprisingly busy at this time. I have not gone on a different day other than a Sunday so I don't know if it is that busy every day. The time I arrived was the period in which they were switching shifts. So our waiter got confused. Even Though they were having some problems finding who was supposed to serve us, the employees were very kind and tried their hardest to fix the mess.  unfortunately, it was just a lot of waiting. When I came I was just there for the cheesecake. Let's just say I was very impressed. My family and I all ordered cheesecake to share with each other. The only other thing I ordered was a smoothy. The cheesecake tasted really good. It was rich and was everything cheesecake should be. My favorite was the white chocolate raspberry. On the other hand, my smoothy was not that great. It lost its flavor and tasted like ice with some mango. Even Though I didn't have a fantastic time, I think it is still a good place to go for a treat.    This is definitely not a restaurant for people on a diet. It is nearly impossible to resist such good looking food. Obviously, cheesecake isn't very healthy, but it can't hurt to have some every once and awhile. The only thing that really bothered me was that they didn't have much for lighting. It was hard to adjust after coming from a sunny day. I would not recommend you go there if you have trouble seeing in low light. Also, I recommend not going on the weekend."
Lauren G.,"Omaha, NE",67,79,38,3.0,11/8/2014,Service: okay at best  Food: the fried mac and cheese is to DIE FOR to be honest haven't had much else there so sorry Cheesecake: delightful the only bad part is I always have to take it home cause I'm so full... Maybe I'll start with the cheesecake best time lol Not bad not bad
Average J.,"Omaha, NE",3,45,5,2.0,8/21/2015,"Well here's my breakdown 1st... Our Waitress...5 Food...............2 Cleanliness.....3.5 (My arm found some sticky who knows what jiz it was and the Salt & Pepper shakers were sticky and the pepper had the salt top on it. Couldn't shake pepper out with a jackhammer!) Seating..........3.5 (Tried to sit us in one of those ""I can't move my arms because the table next to me is against me"" tables. What idiot thought up that kind of seating? Who wants somebody you don't know with their snot dripping kid sitting next to them trying to play with stuff from the other table while the worthless parents pay no attention to them! Seriously people...SPREAD OUT!!! If I wanted to eat with stinky people next to, I would have joined a COMMUNE! But seriously, our waitress was spot on! Always kept checking on us. Kept the drinks flowing and was most helpful on the menu after we had to sort through the AD'S! What the....AD's in the menu? What is wrong with you GOOFBALLS? I was ready to jerk each page out with an ad for some other company. What a shill! But the back of the house dropped the ball. Overall experience was probably a 3.5 or so, but the food quickly brought that number crashing down, hence the 2 star! If it was all based solely on our Waitress, then I would have given the place a 5 star!"
Jay M.,"Hays, KS",0,6,,1.0,1/7/2017,Omaha's Cheese Cake Factory is awful. There three days ago place was empty. Food was cold and the service was awful!  Our waitress couldn't get  salad dressing any sooner than 10 min. Lots of other places to eat in Omaha. Take this one off you list.
Ashley M.,"Omaha, NE",0,4,,1.0,12/31/2016,"1 star due to being food poisoned. I went with my fiance, sister, and brother in law. I got the mushroom burger. The next day I was nauseous,but that night was the worst night of my life. I thought maybe I was getting that nasty bug that's going around. Oh no...my fiance ate my other half of my burger leftovers the next night and is now sick just like I was. Lasted about 8 hours of pure DEATH! It was everyone's first time except for me...thought it would be a nice night out to celebrate the holidays..."
R J.,"Omaha, NE",0,3,,1.0,2/22/2016,"Wow, is this place overpriced. I had a bowl of the white chicken chili and it barely covered the bottom of the bowl. It also came with a tiny scoop of white rice. I took one look at it and called the manager over...for 14 bucks the amount was ridiculous. He took a small amount off our bill and explained to me that the portions are weighed and consistent with all locations. Well, that maybe true but then corporate should really then look at what is being served because this is a total ripoff. I literally had the entree done with about six bites. The taste was good but not worth the price. The prices of other items way overpriced as well. I will not be eating here again. And, for crying out loud, get the entrance way fixed. Chunks of loose concrete by the front door does not make for a good first impression. Darn shame because this was a decent place to eat at one time...."
Slash M.,"Fremont, NE",0,149,35,4.0,5/8/2015,First visit here and it was great. Friday night and the place was packed. We were seated right away on the patio. I started off with a pineapple Moscow mule. Very tasty indeed! Got the fried mac and cheese burger. Cooked exactly as I requested. It was an awesome burger. Finished off with the tiramisu. I will be back for another run at that dessert menu.
Trish N.,"Grand Prairie, TX",153,54,5,2.0,5/18/2015,"My mother and I have came from Sioux City and when I heard that Omaha had a Cheesecake Factory near by, I was excited. The food was delicious, don't get me wrong. The filet mignon was just right. However, I was bothered by the customer service. We were seated down before the table besides us and they have gotten served first and the waitress didn't seem to care much about serving our table. We didn't even get our bread, I didn't even know about the bread until we looked around and every table had a loaf besides ours. Then when I paid, I went to get a slice of Tiramisu cheesecake and here is a group of employees who were too busy talking to one another, I kept calling out, "" Excuse me? Excuse me..."" and they were still ignoring me until I was about to turn and leave and that's when one of the girl took her time to approach me and had the sloppiest attitude. Smh."
Dawn M.,"Omaha, NE",15,36,13,1.0,10/24/2016,"So I got a message from the Cheese Cake Factory's manager saying I should have brought it up to them about my food being cold. Well I did to your server and all she said was, ""Oh, I'm sorry"". Your place was packed when we left. Maybe the manager should go around and ask their guest how every thing is going. Trust and believe I will Never eat at your place again. I only went since my daughter came out of town to visit me. She wanted to eat there. I don't like eating in Omaha. Only in Sarpy CO, or CB."
Cory Z.,"Fremont, NE",0,1,,1.0,3/8/2016,"If you like hair in your food, then this is definitely the place to go. Happened to us 6 times in the last 2 years."
Mark N.,"Omaha, NE",84,253,1099,4.0,4/1/2014,"I usually avoid chain restaurants, but today was my Mother's 80th Birthday and she chose to go here this evening. The first observation is the 80's Eclectic Hollywood, Miami Vice Don Johnson, interior décor, with a wall of Mordor's evil eyes staring at you. Quaint. Next observation was our great server Mandi. She answered all our questions, gave advice, told to get this instead of that, a very nice  personality. I was going to get the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta, but she suggested the Chicken and Shrimp Gumbo instead (she was from NOLA area, yet a-third Italian) It was very well presented and not too overwhelming seasoning that I have had in other restaurants who try to make Cajun foods. My mother liked her Angel Hair Shrimp (she is pretty picky). My brother and mother split the Original Cheesecake for dessert and they said it was the best they have ever had. While others got a Sunday which was the real thing. I might even go back for some other dishes. Maybe. I was good though for a chain."
Teresa M.,"Omaha, NE",23,49,36,3.0,2/27/2016,"Obviously the cheesecake is bomb...(at $7.95 a slice it should be) but honestly, I won't be back. The food is OK, nothing to boast about and the prices are higher than any other comparable restaurant. The service is sooooo slow. It took us 2 hours for lunch. The only stand out part of this review and I wish I had her name, was the server who cared my son was getting upset because he was starving and our food was taking forever after we waited 20 min to get seated. She wasn't even my server and saw him starting to fuss and brought over a ""baby plate"" which was bananas and bread. It did the trick, so thank you for caring!"
Peter H.,"River North, Chicago, IL",1,2,11,1.0,3/13/2016,Two weeks in the USA and this place wins the award for worst service. An hour and 10 minute wait for a seat is acceptable even though a 45 minute estimate was given. However waiting over an hour for the food to arrive was unacceptable with no apology  for such an extended delay. The food was average at best.
Azrael R.,"Bellevue, NE",1,10,,4.0,5/24/2016,"Me and a buddy went to The cheesecake factory. Well, we have been here multiple times before but never left reviews.  We got there and it was somewhat busy, but that is to be expected. I got the menu and it was like getting a miniature phone book. Way too many items on the list...but even though the menu was large...the food was decent.  I ordered the Avocado egg rolls for an appetizer and the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp. Both were really good...just a little pricey."
Laurel S.,"Shawnee, KS",61,405,3,1.0,4/1/2015,"Honestly I just do not get the Cheesecake Factory.  I have been to a few over the years and the food is just mediocre at best and the menu is so big it is overwhelming.  This particular experience was a Friday during Lent so no meat.  My daughter and I ordered a pasta dish that was supposed to have lightly breaded shrimp.  Well the shrimp had no breading and was extremely over cooked and tough.  Then we found the breading, little balls of gooey breading in the pasta (but not on the shrimp!)  YUCK.  My other daughter ordered fish and chips -- GREASY!!!"
Noah C.,"Omaha, NE",10,40,,3.0,5/15/2015,"Cleanliness 5 Service 5 Food 4 Overall 3 So your first might wonder why my overall grading is a 3 when the rest were 4/5. The thing that brought down the overall grade was the price. The food is great, service is great, but I felt I could have gotten something just as good somewhere else for considerable cheaper.  The Cheesecake Factory is a great place to go for special occasions, but I feel it is just simply expensive for what you get. They have a huge menu and lots of options! They have amazing service and really take care of their guests. But I guess you pay for it all in the end with the bill.  For the price that i received one slice of cheesecake I could have made one myself with just a few more dollars and received at least 8 times more. $7-$8 for one slice is alot IMO. Don't get me wrong, the cheesecake is amazing and tastes great."
Jodi T.,"Omaha, NE",0,6,,1.0,10/18/2016,"This review pertains to the To Go service.  I have now been waiting 45 minutes for ONE order.  The server just informed me that she has ""talked to the kitchen manager"" and they are ""working on it"".  It is 7:30 on a Tuesday night.  The restaurant is not busy.  I called in a To Go order because I wanted To Go home with it.  They should probably rename this process To Wait."
