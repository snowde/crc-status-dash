Jason G.,"Omaha, NE",83,357,111,5.0,10/20/2014,"Words can't even begin to describe the awesomeness that was this meal...Never having been to a CF yet hearing good things I was still pretty stunned with the quality...Our server Sarah was great and friendly and a real credit to the CF...Snow and I started off with Chicken fried sliders, and chicken pot-stickers in this indescribably tasty sauce...the sliders were perfect, not too hard/crunchy and just really tasty...the pot-stickers themselves were pretty damn good, but the sauce was next level awesomeness...and it made for an excellent dipping sauce for the bread...Snow ordered a ginormous salad, which she ended up taking home to make room for cheesecake...Sound decision...I ordered the chicken and biscuits with mashed taters and veggies...now, I'm not normally a big vegetable person...to be honest, I hate the damn things...but CF actually made them tasty and delicious...the chicken was perfectly cooked, the biscuits were also as good as they could possibly get, and even the mashed taters I loved...even with the peelings inside, which normally drives me insane, but CF even made that taste good lol...I couldn't even eat it all since naturally I had to leave room for cheesecake...Snow ordered the lemon meringue cheesecake and I ordered the Reese's peanut butter cheesecake...Now is where words may fail me because upon taking that first bite I blacked out from sheer orgasmic joy at the tastiness that I had just put into my mouth...Never have I had something so yummy and out of this world excellent...I will be using this memory as my permanent happy place when I'm down, that's how good it was...Snow's choice was also just as awesome...I honestly have no complaints which is why CF gets an immediate 5 stars even after only one visit...yes they're expensive, but this isn't Denny's or the Village Inn...do yourself a favor and come here as soon as possible because it's just that damn good..."
Jennifer R.,"Junction City, KS",0,2,1,5.0,9/13/2013,Love this place. As others stated a little on the expensive side but the portions you get are massive.  The have the best chicken strips and ranch dressing around.  I would definitely recommend you save room for dessert because their cheesecake is divine!
Kathe S.,"Grimes, IA",98,63,157,2.0,10/12/2015,"We had lunch there on Friday October 9th about 12:30 and there were 13 of us.  We were there for a a pre-wedding lunch with family.  They seated us right away at hightops by the bar area which was FANTASTIC!  Our waiter came over to us right away and took our drink orders (Everyone just ordered water, pop, or tea). We ordered 2 appetizers and were waiting for our bread but the bread never came.  Finally, after our appetizers came we asked for some bread - which usually bread comes as soon as you sit down.  We then all ordered.  My husband and I were the first to order and he got the pit beef sandwhich and I got the cajun chicken littles.  Everyone got their food except for my husband and I and one other person.  After about 10 minutes they brought the other persons food but still not ours.  We had to ask twice about our food and finally after everyone was 3/4 of the way done eating we got ours.  I think he had forgotten to put ours in or something.  It took quite awhile to get our checks and then he had messed up a couple of our checks - additional charges and he also gave someone the wrong credit card slip.  We were really running behind and it was taking forever to get our bill fixed and to get our food boxed up.  This waiter was very nice but either had never had a large group before or needed help.  It was not a good experience at all.  Our food was very good but the rest of the experience was very bad."
Maureen W.,"Omaha, NE",10,1,,1.0,10/18/2015,"I will keep this short and sweet. Our food came out in 3 parts . 2 plates, 2 plates, then 1. It took 10 min for this, so by the time my food arrived everyone elses was cold. Burger was overcooked, when I asked for rare. The server barely waited on us. That's the short...cheesecake was good, there is your sweet."
Solomon H.,"Lincoln, NE",62,18,26,3.0,12/18/2014,"Good place to eat! We had spicy cashew chicken (good), nachos( good), mac & cheese (good), the omelet(ok), kale salad( very good), tomato basil flat bread(ok) & of course the desert. Mango key lime ( excellent)  & peppermint bark ( good). Overall the food & service were good! We will come back again!"
Nick M.,"Kieler, WI",9,5,,3.0,9/4/2016,"Food was great.  Service was far from good, waiter was talking to his friends instead of doing his job, mentioned this to management and they made no attempt whatsoever to correct the situation."
Shelby B.,"Omaha, NE",81,536,997,3.0,7/25/2015,"Not really impressed overall.  Stopped in on a Sunday evening and the place was packed, so it is definitely popular with a lot of people.  I am always immediately skeptical when a restaurants menu is the size of a children's book.  Usually when you try to be everything to everyone, you end up being mediocre at best.  That pretty much sums up my experience.  As the place was packed, our server seemed a bit overwhelmed.  She was friendly, but it took quite a while to grab our drink orders and ask if we wanted to put in any appetizers.  Not a big deal, but to wait then a bit longer for our drinks, only she forgot mine.  After a second reminder, my single Moscow Mule showed up 25 minutes after I ordered it.  I ordered the Rib Eye, and it was fair at best.  It was prepared just fine, but was somewhat tough and lacked flavor.  Our server managed one water refill during dinner, and pretty much all 9 of our water glasses were empty for the last 25+ minutes we were there.  While overall this place doesn't merit a 2 star review, it barely makes 3 in my book.  There simply was nothing that was a stand out, and our server simply had way too many tables to contend with to provide decent service to any of them."
Molly R.,"Omaha, NE",256,5,,4.0,11/15/2015,"Food is always good & service is always good. Definitely my boyfriend and I's go to restaurant! Although, as a hostess myself, I have noticed the hostesses lack friendliness."
Anna L.,"Omaha, NE",0,12,,2.0,11/21/2014,"I don't understand why this place is so popular. What it is - is overpriced, that's for sure, even for lunch! I've ordered vegetarian pizza, which was hard and plain. I've also had salmon stake, it was better, but you could certainly cook such a stake yourself and save a lot of money. I've had 3 sorts of cheesecakes, wasn't overly impressed but quite like the one with mango."
John J.,"Massapequa Park, NY",4,39,16,4.0,8/6/2016,"After about a half hour wait, we were finally seated...on the first floor that had been closed when we walked in! Then after our timer/sensor went off, we still waited! When we finally asked, we were told that we belonged seated on the first floor....well, when were the gonna tell us? As for the food and service, delicious and great! Only 1 issue....my beans could've been served hot!"
Eric W.,"Omaha, NE",47,44,73,1.0,7/30/2015,"I honestly have no idea why I come back every so often..went there yesterday for National Cheesecake day, it was busy but no busier than another time we've been there.   It was about a 15 minute wait to be seated, once seated it took about 5 minutes to get any water and a total of 10 minutes to get our drinks.  Server immediately asked if we were getting cheesecake (we were planning on getting food too), we hesitated for a moment and said yes.  Ordered our cheese cakes, they literally took 20-30 minutes to receive; only after them giving it to the table next to us, so they noticed the mistake and took it from the other table and then gave it to me..but had my guests order wrong..there wee tables around us who ordered after us and got their order before us.  The service was hands down the worst ever. Thank goodness the cheesecakes were half off but they sure bent us over on our drinks at $11 each, will never be getting anything but water in the future if there is one."
Rosalie W.,"Omaha, NE",0,4,,5.0,6/23/2016,I have always loved the cheese cake factory! Great food for a decent price. Awesome wait staff. And unique decor throughout.
Charles T.,"Omaha, NE",11,21,7,4.0,9/23/2015,We used the gift card that we got for Christmas. The interior was very high class very comfortable. The food was pretty good but I had a hard baguette for my sandwich so my meal was not very good. Naturally this place does great cheesecake as the sign says however not really sure I would go back unless I had a good reason to go. The other people seem to like it and they thought the food was very good. The service was exceptional and overall I thought it was a good experience.
Sharawn G.,"Queens, NY",26,52,15,3.0,8/8/2015,Service could of been a little bit faster...and our waitress took forever to bring our bread..water..and mixed drinks! But after she was quite attentive..food was delicious..I had the Farfalle with chicken and roasted garlic..it was amazing! Smoky..sharp..rich..mmm good! Oh! And don't order drinks! 12bucks for a margarita! Ridiculous..they have lost their damn minds lol..other than that id go back lol
Kendall W.,"Omaha, NE",119,1,,2.0,1/18/2016,Poor service.  Waiting for an hour + with a family and children is unacceptable. We checked in and moved to bar area and was switched waiters twice.
Debbie W.,"Bellevue, NE",118,2,,4.0,4/23/2016,"We went here to eat this afternoon & was surprised to get seated rather quickly, being told our server would soon be with us. Quite some time went by and a wonderful young waitress approached our table asking if we'd been helped yet. We said no & she immediately told us she tried to find who had our booth but wasn't going to leave us sit any longer. Took our order & said she'd tell them to put a rush in it as we'd waited a long time and need to leave shortly. 15 minutes later my husband was served, 10 minutes later my daughter & myself with an explanation that my fries were being cooked and they'd bring them right out. No one ever came back until we were finished & needed to leave. I was stuffed anyway as the portions were huge & asked that they please just take them off my bill. She was mortified that we had such poor service & took it upon herself to send the manager ( I assume ) over. He asked us what our experience was like & we told him.... Not complaining... Because, STUFF HAPPENS. He said that's NOT the way they like to handle business ... They took our drinks off of our bill & sent us home with 3 slices of DELICIOUS CHEESECAKE. All of our food was wonderful, a bit pricey but we knew that going in. We were very impressed with their insistence to apologize & attempt to make it right...."
Dustin L.,"Greenland, NH",18,64,,4.0,6/18/2015,Nice night.  Food was good.  Service was prompt and friendly.   Cheesecake was very good.  Went on a Wednesday night before rush hour.  We'll be back in the future.
Mandy P.,"Auburn, MA",1,19,7,2.0,6/23/2015,"It's Cheesecake Factory you should know what you're getting, over priced mediocre food."
Jo T.,"Kahului, HI",0,1,,5.0,3/31/2016,"Katia our server was amazing, super friendly and very fast service. The food was excellent our whole experience was great! This was at the Green Valley Pkwy Henderson NV 89052."
Erik Y.,"Lincoln, NE",93,251,307,3.0,3/20/2015,"Why I like it:  HUGE menu, lots of variety on cheesecakes, and good drinks.  That's it in a nutshell.  Let me expand a bit.  Cheesecake Factory is a chain, so they automatically loose a star for that, but they are a upscale chain restaurant with very nice décor and better then average food.  Not everything at the cheesecake factory is good, I have eaten at a number of them and can tell you first hand things like shepherds pie and some of the salads are fairly blah.  However that said, they do have a few dishes I like.   1st, for appetizer I enjoy the firecracker salmon.  It is salmon wrapped in wontons wrappers and deep fried, served on a huge pile of red cabbage and drizzled with a nice teriyaki sauce.  Very tasty but not enough food for more then 2 people.  Heck, I have eaten it by myself as an app myself. Vietnamese Shrimp Summer Rolls are also excellent as an App. 2nd.  They used to have an excellent Thai Chicken Pasta that I enjoyed but for some reason they got rid of it.  They still have some nice pasta options like spicy chipotle chicken and the pasta carbonara.  Other things I really enjoy include Herb Crusted Filet of Salmon, Fish Tacos, and the chicken and biscuits are excellent. It reminds me of a deconstructed chicken pot pie with peppery white gravy. And now for the cheesecakes.  Yes I have tried nearly every flavor at one point or another over the last 20+ years visiting a cheesecake factory someplace in the country.  In fact I visited my first one in Newport Beach, CA back in 1990.  I'm not even sure if its still there!  But, over the years I have developed a taste for a few of them, and can rank them in what I believe is their worst, to their best.  Here we go: 32. Low Carb Cheesecake with Strawberries  - Yuck 31. White Chocolate Caramel Macadamia Nut  - Not a fan of white chocolate with caramel. 30. Kahlua Cocoa Coffee Cheesecake  Coffee in dessert is not my thing 29. Tiramisu  I'll stick with the original, and I don't really like coffee in my desserts. 28. Pineapple Upside-Down Cheesecake  Not very good 27. The Original  Boring 26. Chocolate Mousse  Not a fan of mousse. I want a better chocolate. 25. White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle  This one is ok, but again, not a fan of white chocolate 24. Adam's Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple  Not bad, but they have better 23. The Original with Cherry Preserves  The original is good, and cherry makes it a little better 22. Craig's Crazy Carrot Cake Cheesecake  I like carrot cake, but this one is a miss 21. Key Lime  I like it, but it's a weee bit tart 20. Ultimate Red Velvet Cake  Getting better on the chocolate front but they have better 19. Mango Key Lime  This is a good option for tart and sweet. 18. Dulce de Leche Caramel Cheesecake  This is a good one, worth trying. 17. Fresh Banana Cream Cheesecake  Reminds me of banana cream pie, but better 16. Pina Colada Cake  Different take. I feel like I'm in the islands 15. Caramel Pecan Turtle Cheesecake  Love me a turtle in any way. This is a good option 14. Vanilla Bean Cheesecake  For something so simple, it works.  Tastes like rich vanilla ice cream. 13. Dutch Apple Caramel Streusel  Apple Pie Cheesecake.  It is good 12. Wild Blueberry White Chocolate Cheesecake  This is the only white chocolate cheesecake I actually like 11. Chocolate Tuxedo Cream  Vanilla and Chocolate twist.  Very good 10. Toasted Marshmallow S'mores Galore  This is one of my favorites.  Worth getting for sure. 9. Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake  If you want chocolate, this one is great, but almost TOO much chocolate. it's fairly dark chocolate. 8. The Original with Fresh Strawberries  A classic, and very very good. 7. Reese's Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake.  The best peanut butter cake I have had in some time.  Great if you don't want a cheesecake 6. 30th Anniversary Chocolate Cake  Probably the best chocolate item they have.  perfect flavors 5. Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough  I am so partial to chocolate chip cookie dough anything, and this cheesecake is excellent. 4. OREO Dream Extreme  If you like Oreo's, you will love this cheesecake.  I do. 3. Lemon Raspberry Cream  When you are sick of chocolate, this sweet and tart cheesecake is perfect.  My favorite fruit cheesecake they have.  2. Hershey's Chocolate Bar Cheesecake  This is also probably the best chocolate item they have. Honestly, this and the 30th aniv chocolate cake are both fantastic, but this one is readily available everywhere. 1. Chris' Outrageous Cheesecake  This is the best of the best.  German Chocolate, coconut, pecan frosting, omg, this thing is the bomb."
