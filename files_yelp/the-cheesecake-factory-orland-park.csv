Alex A.,"Orland Park, IL",0,15,,4.0,8/27/2017,good food and great service.  but their portion got smaller i think. best cheese cake
Tracy J.,"Chicago, IL",7,29,,1.0,12/23/2017,"Third time trying this place, and it's just pretty clear, this joint is a complete waste of time and money. Food is mediocre at best. Bland, blah, slightly below average. Extensive menu of a bunch of stuff you don't want.  Who knew there were so many unappetizing ways to prepare chicken????? Prices pretty high. Service, hit or miss. Went today and waited over an hour for our food, which came with one of the plates so old with waiting that the accompanying sauce had congealed and the mashed potatoes had grown another skin. No concession offered.  You're gonna wanna miss this place.  Even the cheesecake is remarkably unremarkable. Lousy."
Renayle F.,"Willowbrook, IL",44,19,8,2.0,12/22/2017,"I used to enjoy this location, but lately, it seems that it isn't as good as it used to be. My husband and I went on a Wednesday evening. We were seated right away, but our server was hard to understand because he was talking barely above a whisper.  We got the Asian chicken lettuce wraps as an appetizer. While the chicken was good, we both wished the wraps came in more than one piece of lettuce because the chicken kept falling out. My meal was the tuna tataki salad, and my husband got spaghetti and meatballs. After we get our food, my husband notices a little bit of sauce underneath the plate, so he goes to wipe it u, and he says it feels dirty. I felt underneath it, and it seemed like it was food still stuck on there. We checked mine, and it felt and looked like the dishes really weren't cleaned at all. My salad was okay, but there was a lot of dressing on it and made the mixed greens soggy so I couldn't eat them. My husband sad the meatballs were good but the spaghetti was really chewy. The manager did apologize for it and took it off our bill, but I was still disappointed. I know it was Wednesday and it wasn't crowded, but the experience turned me off on this location. I'll go to the one in Oakbrook from now on."
Rachel B.,"Tampa, FL",46,150,596,3.0,7/8/2017,"Epically bad service, starting with the host stand. 3 adults and a child approach and ask for a table of 4. We wait a few minutes and then get taken to a table that is missing a chair. One of us stands awkwardly waiting for them to bring a chair from somewhere in the back. Then we sit and the host hands out 2 adult menus and 2 kid menus. Did I mention we were very obviously 3 adults? From the time we were sat, it took 17 minutes for our drinks to hit the table. Over 5 minutes to be greeted, then she just disappeared. When our meals were served, 2 were wrong (one was missing a side, one was the wrong type of salad dressing). Seriously, it was bad. Won't be going back to this location when in town."
Lexi T.,"Chicago, IL",7,63,6,1.0,1/1/2018,Ghetto lady at the bakery was Soooo rude I didn't even want anything anymore. Unbelievable how the other employee in the bakery didn't even acknowledge I was standing there for at least 8 minutes. #newyearnewstaff
Brian B.,"Homer Glen, IL",1,10,,1.0,1/5/2018,Extremely dirty and service slow. They wiped off table but left pieces of silverware on floor. Staff does not work as a team everyone is working on there own. Took forever to get food and drinks.
ReJoyce L.,"Richton Park, IL",5,22,32,3.0,12/28/2017,"Before coming here I was nervous because I had a bad experience here and I told my best friend that I didn't feel comfortable coming. After ordering our food we had to wait about 45 minutes for them to tell us that the rice  was over cooked and it would take about 20 minutes to remake the order. Being in food service, I understand mistakes could happen so I graciously waited and told them no problem. Since I was being kind, I ended up getting my entire bill covered. Even though an issue arises the waiter and the manager stayed on top of it and made sure that we were taken care of."
Carrie D.,"Orland Park, IL",0,3,,3.0,1/9/2018,The cheesecake is alright but the service could be better
B. B.,"Markham, IL",0,26,3,4.0,12/30/2017,Wonderful place and staff. Great food and presentation. All was well and pleasant. The only thing lacking was space for seating. And the wait wasnt bad for me with partying of 2 but anything more. Tbey wait is crazy. However if they are worth it to you then to each his own.
Charles P.,"Orland Park, IL",51,51,104,4.0,12/8/2017,I enjoy having a cocktail here once in a while. They make them perfect each time. The cheesecake is always good. The food has always been great though we do not commonly dine in at this location. One thing I never understood was the noisey mall area seating. I would feel like a fish in a fish bowl if I was ever seated out there.
L P.,"Oak Lawn, IL",1,33,5,2.0,12/22/2017,This place is nothing like the one in the West suburbs. They miss out on the seasoning. Super bland. Other than that they are not bad. Just bad that the entire point of going there is to eat. At least they did not mess up on the cheesecakes.
Tom R.,"Matteson, IL",2,18,10,4.0,12/21/2017,"We got a gift card for Christmas, so we decided to use it today. The wife ordered the shrimp and chicken gumbo. While she felt the overall taste and flavor was excellent, she thought it was a bit too spicy for her. So she ordered another one and told them to tone it down. I understand that the jambalaya is even hotter! I had the ginger glazed salmon. I think they call it miso. Very very good. We both had the bowl of cream of wild mushroom soup which was outstanding. Excellent service from Megan"
Irene Kitty L.,"Chicago, IL",1,21,47,4.0,4/2/2017,"Cheesecake factory is one of my favorite place. It's got great food, drinks, bread and dessert! Everything I've tried is delicious and my kids also love this place with so many cheesecake choices to choose from! Always clean and always friendly.  This particular location I don't like the bar area. It's super loud and can't talk at all so if you're looking for a quiet place to talk, stay away from the bar area. The hostess service is ok. Not very friendly every time but the waitress and waiters are always fantastic! Food is always great at this location and cheesecake is always good here as well. But if you're picking up cheesecake, that area is not friendly either. So I guess food and waiter and waitress is awesome. Front desk and cheesecake area not. That's why I couldn't give it a 5 star even though I want to so badly.  I'll always go back because parking is easy and again the waitress and waiter service is great so they deserve a great tip. I would come again and hopefully one day I can give this location 5 stars very soon."
Trina P.,"Midlothian, IL",17,2,,2.0,1/24/2017,"My fiance and I went to The Cheesecake Factory this past Sunday to celebrate his birthday since he's never eaten here before. I must say it is the worst experience I've had so far and I love the Cheesecake Factory. We were seated in the booth area seats, and there was a gentleman sitting in a chair right in the middle of the aisle so of course people had to go around him which meant they were bumping into our table. Of course we complained to our waitress and she said that we weren't the only people complaining so I don't understand why the manager wouldn't come out and have the gentleman either sit in the booth or sit his party somewhere else. We were ready to start our meal off with appetizers and unfortunately all of the favorite ones that I like that I suggested to my fiance they were out of. The one we finally chose was a good, but still it's not what we really wanted. Then on to dinner, all of the choices that I asked for they were out of, So once again I had to settle for something else but thankfully it was good. Then we had to listen to employees arguing as they're walking down the aisle, then other employees playing behind the cheesecake display, not to mention the fact that when you got up to go to the bathroom you literally slid all the way there because the floors was so slippery. Not one time did we see a manager walking around and we were there for almost 3 hours. Of course I sent an email letting the company know about my experience, that was on Monday morning still haven't heard anything ,no apology no phone calls from any managers, nothing. My fiance also went up there to talk to the manager that was on duty and he says that she seemed like she didn't even care about the situation. She just explained that they had poor quality food and they didn't want to serve it to the customers,  this is when the manager should have been out to apologize. He then went on to tell her this was a bad first impression and he was uncertain he would come back and she just brushed it off, saying we will send you guys some gift cards.....we will see."
Ashley C.,"Chicago, IL",0,4,3,1.0,12/29/2017,"Myself and my boyfriend dined in this past Tuesday. Seated at without 10 minutes of arriving at 3:45p, left at 5:45p. Upon being seated I went to the restroom to wash my hands. Every stall was out of toilet tissue except one and the toilet paper was not on the roll.  Gross #1 that means people are picking it up in order to get paper. Gross #2 the bathroom was not clean. Gross #3 I go to wash my hands and a manager comes in saying they are out of soap, while placing hand sanitizer on the counter stating to use this for the time being, and that someone is going to buy more soap from upstairs and will be back down. YUCK...I now have to tell each person that comes into the restroom (at least about 6-8 people after myself) that their out of soap, toilet paper, and the water pressure isn't working. Myself and two other women stand in the restroom for about 20 minutes waiting for someone to bring soap. Gross #4 I was horrified that hand sanitizer was being used as a proxy to handwashing. I work in healthcare and that was completely unacceptable. Do you know how many diseases are passed due to poor hygiene?!?! One of the women left to find someone to bring more toilet paper, soap, and to say the restroom needs to be tended to, still waiting. A supervisor then comes in, no soap just to refill the toilet paper rolls in each stall. We all state that we cannot leave the restroom without washing our hands. She proceeds to say they have been out of soap all day, and that the manager went upstairs to bath and body works to buy soap. Gross #5, OUT OF SOAP ALL DAY AND YOU KNEW AND DID NOTHING ABOUT IT, DISGUSTING! I then ask her if the kitchen has soap, she says yes they have soap. I asked if she can bring some of that soap for us to use. She said yes and brought soap from the employee restroom. I wash my hands  thoroughly and leave the restroom.  I get back to the table to find that my boyfriend has been waiting for me to come back for almost 30 minutes. We finally get to order our food, waiters change during this time. 30 minutes later we get our appetizer from another waiter, without the second waiter checking on us once. (first waiter was wonderful but had to move to bartender because of being short staffed) 40 minutes into us sitting at our table the new waiter in passing asks if we ever received bread, we say yes she says okay and never comes back. Once done with the appetizer we wait another 20 minutes for our entree. In total it took 50 minutes for our entree to come out, and my food was luke warm as in it's probably been sitting somewhere for sometime. I ordered the lemon chicken with garlic mashed potatoes and broccoli. At this point when the waiter finally checks on us she goes, ""Oh I see your food finally came out."" I barely ate my food and the waiter noticed asking if I wanted a box, I said no can we please have the check and a manager please. A gentlemen comes to the table a short while later, I explain everything that has gone on since arriving explaining that these things are unacceptable and is a health hazard for those dining in the restaurant, not to mention the Narovirius is going around fast.  The manager made no excuses, he stated he agree with everything I said and informed me that a pipe burst upstairs which cut the water supply/ soap pumps run off of the water supply; explaining the issue with the water pressure when finally washing my hands. He comp'd my meal/Coca Cola and for the trouble of waiting he offered us free cheesecake. I suggested that other patrons should be notified that the restrooms were out of comission to some extent, it's only right. They did end up placing signs on the door explaining the issue and for patron's to use the restrooms in the mall. I'm still horrified about the cleanliness of the restroom and not having soap. I probably won't be eating here anymore."
lorry t.,"Chicago, IL",2,32,,1.0,11/6/2017,"WOW, were do i start. Came here and me and my bf were really hungry. He ordered some chicken pasta, and i got the chicken and steak diane.  - his pasta literally came with 2 pieces of 1 inch chicken nuggets. The rest was pasta.  - mines was better but i notice their steak became 2 bites instead of actually giving you small pieces of steak.  - the bread was cold and hard -waitress didnt even bother filling my water I would of normally complained but my bf was so hungry he didnt feel like waiting for a new plate. I have to say i have been to the oakbrook location and it is a bit better... Definitely way better choices than cheesecake factory, no point of eating out if it isnt even going to be good...could of went to olive garden and would have gotten the same plate for half the price and the bread would of been fresh and warm at least.."
Emily R.,"Tinley Park, IL",61,89,1,1.0,6/6/2017,"I am not a fan of this restaurant and I will never return unless I am starving and this is my only option. Just kidding, it's not THAT terrible. It's simply not my cup of tea. The menu is pretty pricey and the portions are not exactly generous. The worst part is that no matter what dish I seem to get, the quality and taste is just not overwhelming. With the abundance of choices for restaurants in the area, this is definitely not at the top of my list."
Chay G.,"University Park, IL",0,8,350,1.0,11/4/2017,"Very long wait times, not near the time they give when you arrive. We are finally seated outside in the mall area, where it was freezing. We ask to move, and there were open booths, the hostess then tells us we need to wait another 45 minutes. Why would we need to do that and there are the same size booths available? The have a seating system she responded. Don't wait at this location, it is worth it to drive to another one or go somewhere else."
Mohammed A.,"Chicago, IL",34,69,75,1.0,6/11/2017,"Very rude and very unprofessional staff and service that sucks, I come here to the place and ask for a curbside order then they give me hell to answer my phone I was put on hold for a while then when they finally answer the young girl keeps interrupting me and giving me exercises why she can't fulfill my order even though I didn't even finish my order, ( I wanted to order two slices of cheesecake a cheeseburger, but she stopped me at the cheesecake part) and says that she can't bring it out because Cheesecake Factory doesn't take out cheesecake to the curbside which is incorrect, in normal circumstances I would walk in I have no problem but today I have my 7 month old in my car so I'm using service that this restaurant offers, anyway I knew she's just trying to get rid of me it's like she doesn't want any additional business or work, so I ask her for her manager, she passes the phone to someone else who doesn't sound like a manager and doges me and try's to speak louder so I don't hear him, I say: I wanted to order a cheese burger and 2 slices of cheesecake and he says sure when it's ready we'll bring it out, I told him what happened and he totally ignored discussing it, no explanation no discussion nothing, I think great places means nothing without proper staff training, Cheesecake Factory totally ignored proper training for the Orland park location, I had multiple incidents with bad service and almost never had a good experience maybe once. And after all this I go home to cheeseburger that's disquieting and has blood coming out it when I specifically asked for well-done! This is very unpleasant and very unfortunate that this big company hires armatures"
S F.,"Frankfort, IL",22,187,46,5.0,6/14/2017,Didn't eat in the restaurant this time. This review is for the cheese cake bakery. How could I say anything bad. The cheese cake is awesome. Yum! The lady that helped me at the counter was nice and got my request quickly. Thumbs up!
Alzetta H.,"Chicago, IL",191,93,337,3.0,1/16/2017,"Nice Happy hour deals. Typical chain restaurant food. Love the lettuce wrap! Love this location because I have teenage girls and if they want to shop, I will plan it around Happy Hour and relax while they shop. Enormous menu which makes it hard to decide. I think I get anxiety every time I'm handed a menu here."
Jackie B.,"Chicago, IL",1,16,,1.0,10/21/2017,"My husband and I went last week around 8pm. Maybe it just me but I don't like my silverware placed on the table that is being wiped with the same old towel. I asked the waiter to exchange my utensils,plates and napkins because the utensils were on the dirty table and the plate and white napkins were dirty you could actually see they were soiled. The man that cleans the tables come back and proceeded to again put my utensils on the table and the new plate and napkin were still soiled. I asked him to change them out again and don't put my utensils on the table place them on a napkin. This time around finally clean utensils,plates and napkins. Ordered my food appetizers:guacamole, crab cake bites, tempura shrimp, course: chicken piccata,Cajun shrimp and chicken pasta. The guacamole was bland no salt we ordered spicy so there were really big chunks of red and green peppers in there I think they should have been chopped smaller the crab cake bites were ok kinda flavorless and the tempura shrimp was just ok flavorless. The chicken piccata was flavorless but it was ok and the Cajun shrimp and chicken pasta was ok also just need more flavor. The restaurant seemed end of the day dirty I think they should still sweep the floors if you are still open and taking customers and stop putting the utensils on the table that is cleaned with the same dirty towel put them on napkins This was my first and only visit I wasn't impressed and will never go back ."
Colleen C.,"Alsip, IL",247,34,3,1.0,10/16/2017,"Came here to celebrate my friends birthday. Upon my recommendation she ordered the Chicken Romano because she wanted chicken. I ordered the fillet mignon medium rare. What Was brought up to me was a raw filet mignon. I asked that it be cooked to medium rare. I discovered that their policy is not to cook the food to the right temperature but to prepare the patron a new order. This would be great have a had another filet mignon. It's now 25 minutes later, my friend has long since finish her meal and I have still not eaten. Whoever does the ordering for this location needs to go find a job they are capable of doing. Obviously ordering food for a restaurant is not in their skill set. It's the most expensive item on their menu. If they'd like to make money perhaps they should have the product to sell. I ordered something else. It was over cooked. The manager offered to comp us a slice of cheese cake. What a joke. It's now 40 minutes later. I still have not eaten dinner. Manager has now offered to comp my meal."
Tamia C.,"Jackson, MS",0,3,8,4.0,7/26/2017,"Decent food, plenty of places to park, and quality service. Tried the Tex-mex egg rolls and slider appetizers. We were served Pepsi product drinks and one lemonade quickly. Then my six relatives and I ordered mixed green salads, pastas, one catfish meal, and a wing appetizer.  Everything was fresh, the pasta napole was delish, my dad enjoyed his jambalaya while, my grandma fished her way through the Louisiana pasta.  So, my only complaints are add more seasoning to the catfish and wash the salad greens thoroughly because the salads taste like unwashed, bitter collard greens.   Other than that, we were all stuffed and pleased with the food and the mouth watering cheese cakes. And I don't even like cheesecake. But ordering the Reese Chocolate cake chessecake is a must!!! Also, my sister loved her Oreo dream!! Keep up the good work. Trying this gem of a chain in Orland will not disappoint."
Lasharee R.,"Country Club Hills, IL",142,24,66,3.0,6/10/2017,I love going to the Cheesecake Factory especially the location that is in downtown Chicago. They so many items in their menu that you can always try something new when you go. First time having the corn tamale cakes and I must say they were delicious.
Pamela F.,"Tinley Park, IL",20,33,67,5.0,2/3/2017,"Tuscan Chicken is healthy, low calorie and so delicious!  I order this dish because it's delicious the low calorie healthy part is just a bonus."
Jazzmin T.,"Chicago Heights, IL",0,11,5,3.0,9/27/2017,"Jessica, our waitress, was extremely sweet and attentive. Aside from that, the food is bland and overpriced. The drinks suffer the same fate. Don't get me wrong, they were well made but 12 & 13 dollars worth?? Absolutely not. The fried macaroni and cheese balls were delicious. The chicken & biscuit entree left much to be desired. Of course the best part was the red velvet cheesecake. Also, a two person bill shouldn't have been $90. Not from this establishment. Honestly, I could've made a better meal at home. I'd only return for a drink....If someone else is paying."
Daniela C.,"Bellwood, IL",275,27,43,4.0,6/10/2017,"Something feels weird about this place... I feel like maybe the weird feeling comes from the fact this restaurant is located in a mall. In my opinion by coming to Orland Square Cheesecake Factory has lowered the status they built in Oakbrook. I would never go to this location for a special event. The food is semi-okay.. today I ordered a side of broccoli and an iced tea while my mom had an entree and it took well over 20 minutes to receive my food.. so there's that. I prefer the Oakbrook location for special events, but orland is great for a quick bite."
Ashton S.,"Chicago, IL",9,41,81,5.0,6/7/2017,I've been to this location twice I really enjoyed the food and dessert. This time I just got the chocolate tower cake. Soooo good.
Grant W.,"Herriman, UT",87,28,2,5.0,9/22/2017,I was extremely surprised how good it was and how great the service was because I saw two and a half stars and I usually don't stop for anything under four stars by The Cheesecake Factory usually isn't bad anywhere I've gone and this one was outstanding food was perfect everything was on time they overly served me and kept bringing me refills after refills so I really appreciate this place excellent job guys excellent job!
R S.,"Park Forest, IL",0,11,3,3.0,10/1/2017,"10.1.17 usually eat here with the Fam. Today just with hubby and baby. So sorry to say food was cold.. Luke warm at best... the manager came to the table and stuck his finger in our food, he took the food away but he held the plates right over our baby's head.. The server then came back to the table..... Supposedly one of the heat lamps ""didn't work"" I guess it took our food to discover that. He took the order off our bill. At least we didn't have to pay for food we didn't consume but why should we. They gave us free cheesecake to pacify us. This experience kind of turned me off to coming here for a while."
Julie C.,"Palos Heights, IL",14,114,48,4.0,3/25/2017,"45 minute wait? At 5:15 pm? Ridiculous!  Sit at the bar or the high-tops - first come, first served. Huge menu. We've eaten at various locations; the food is good, service can be spotty."
Tracy R.,"Chicago, IL",36,71,159,4.0,8/26/2017,"My experience was great. After reading all the terrible reviews, I was wary of this location. The staff was friendly, the place was spotless, and the food was good. I do not understand the gripe about prices either--most entrees were roughly $15. As a Chicago resident, I can attest that you definitely cannot ""eat at the best Chicago restaurants,"" as one reviewer claimed, for $15. I had honey-truffle chicken which was delicious. Can I substitute asparagus for green beans? No problem. We had a table for 10 and the only mixup was a child's cheese pizza in place of the pepperoni she had ordered--immediate apology and fixed in minutes. Never had to ask or wait for a refill, my coke was switched out when it reached the 1/3 mark. Cheesecake slices are generous, after a meal it is probably best to share a piece or take home."
Candice B.,"Calumet City, IL",45,10,23,5.0,5/7/2017,Great service delicious food nice portions.... And not a long wait time on this Saturday as were celebrating my daughters birthday
Jovascea R.,"Hammond, IN",151,4,2,2.0,9/1/2017,Very disappointed with the service and food not one order of my 4 orders placed was correct not to mention the veggie burger was supposed to be made with a brown rice it was white and bland I'll never come here again
Michelle M.,"Schererville, IN",44,203,42,4.0,7/8/2016,Who doesn't love the Cheesecake Factory?! Thai Lettuce Wraps (my absolute fave) Eggroll Sampler Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp Cajun Jambalaya Pasta Miso Salmon Macaroni and Cheese Burger Oreo Dream Extreme Cheesecake White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle  Lemon Raspberry Cream Cheesecake Kahlua Cocoa Coffee Cream Cheesecake Goblet of Strawberries All Amazing. They also offer bread and butter before your meal... delicious.
Tina C.,"Tinley Park, IL",0,6,,1.0,11/18/2017,"If I can give a zero stars I would! Tonight was the worst experience ever! Came here waited for 45 mins, 35 mins later some chick and her man came in gave the front desk  girl a hug and told her I'll get you in fast! 10 mins had pass wow her friend ( the front desk girl) grab two menus and sat them down! I guess at this point she skip me and about four other people who was waiting! So at this point I get a little hangry! I walk up to the guy behind the counter ( young African American with dreds)and ask for the manger ,he claim to be the manger!  told him we were here first and waited for 45mins! He had the nerve and look at me and laugh! I told him that it was wrong and it the principle of us waiting then someone who just walks in and know the person!  Dinner was pretty awkward because our server totally was looking like he didn't want to serve our table or even be at work! This place used to be my favorite but as in last night experiences I'm done!  Anyways rants over I see why this place gets 2 stars! Taking my money somewhere else!"
Cindy H.,"Palos Heights, IL",0,4,,5.0,11/8/2017,We had a party of five  - waited 5 min for a table.  Our server was great - very personable and entertaining / had us laughing.  Food was excellent - my husband got the Shepherd's Pie and really loved it!  He ate it all although it was a really big portion.  I got a Mexican salad off the Skinny menu and loved it - great dressing - really seasoned perfect.  Everyone at our table was really happy.  We'll definitely be back.
Hector G.,"Crown Point, IN",0,2,,5.0,8/23/2017,Great service had gentlemen by the name of Tony help out with an order for pick he went above and beyond great service..
Cristaldo P.,"Crown Point, IN",6,27,59,3.0,7/16/2016,Nice place to hang out with friends. Huge selection on their menu.  Their cheesecake is the best part !! Awesome cheesecake
