Amy R.,"Chicago, IL",0,29,8,2.0,9/5/2014,Really Bummed!  This now location is not as good as the one in Oak Brook.  I usually order from the SkinnyLicious Menu but this time the food and service was not the best.  My Farro Salad was served with overripe tomatoes and cucumbers that look like they were at one time frozen - and this was during the summertime when quality should be really fresh.   The Thai Lettuce Wraps were delicious but totally fell apart.  I didn't send anything back but requested the server at least show  the management  the condition of the tomatoes and cucumbers.  I then watched him take my dish and throw it in a large utility bucket with other dirty dishes....never made it back to management.
Cy D.,"Chicago, IL",66,15,3,1.0,12/27/2012,"Our wait was an hour but that's okay since we walked around the mall first, anyway. Our server was understandably looking stressed out, but he was never rude to us. I got the Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp. My server warned,""It's spicy.""  It was not. My date's fish and chips were unappetizing brown blocks on top of lettuce leaves. My blueberry white chocolate cheesecake did not warrant the $8? a slice. The Cheesecake Factory is obviously a certain type of ""luxury"" brand; I just hate how they can charge so much for their bland cafeteria food."
Kamaria A.,"Merrillville, IN",1,28,1,3.0,10/3/2015,The food was great..hands down..but the service was slow and not so great. Maybe next time will be a better experience!!
Lamia B.,"Chicago, IL",15,11,1,3.0,1/4/2013,"The food was good but the services, were okay. Long wait period so for the meal. So long my baja tacos were cold.  Of course I returned them. The manager did apologize which was  Appreciated. The drinks were awesome. Overall I will return...first the drinks lol."
Hannah R.,"Homewood, IL",0,1,,2.0,8/5/2014,"My sister and I came here last week after a long day of shopping and we decided to treat ourselves.  We both ordered appetizers, the chicken samoas were very good, and that dipping sauce was tangy and perfect.  For dinner we both got the Steak Diane. The steak was a little overcooked, and there was barely any steak on my plate. I had more mushrooms, which was in the sauce than steak!  I can't complain about the sauce. It was great, with the roasted mushrooms and the onions and red wine. Delicious.  When I took a few bites of my mashed potatoes, I noticed that there was literally a whole half of a potato, unpeeled..and it was completely raw!! I told our server and he cleared my whole plate..  Nick, our server was absolutely great, but he called over the manager, and she told me she could take my 4 dollar appetizer off the bill and that was all she could do...  Why would I pay 20 dollars for a steak dinner, not even get to finish it, and have completely in edible potatoes?!  Thank you Cheesecake Factory, you completely ruined my day and now I question whether I will ever return..  You only get two stars because Nick, our server was awesome. Bye"
Abby M.,"Homewood, IL",27,16,10,2.0,8/4/2014,For the money there are a million places to go that serve better food and have better service around this area. The only thing they do well is cheesecake cuz it comes already made - hooray - and alcoholic beverages. Their mojito is legit. Otherwise the food is overpriced and always always sub par. Maybe it's just this location; Oakbrook and Woodfield are always pretty nice. My to-go food has never been right either. Save your money!
Christopher R.,"Homer Glen, IL",20,107,,5.0,3/28/2015,The food is Great I love Cheesecake and the location is good the staff is friendly too.
C M.,"Elmhurst, IL",3,70,,4.0,1/5/2013,"I was anxious for this place to open. Its great for the mall which really needed a decent restaurant and Orland doesn't have a lot of variety so I think it will do well.  Love Cheesecake factory but its servings are way too large for one person. So my husband split everything from here and even then the servings are over the top.  I wish they would work on a few dishes which are nutrarian: high density nutrition greens without any refined carbs or fat or oils. Some fruit in salad without high salt content beans would be awesome.  The place was packed, had a line out the door after Christmas and we would go back. I just wish they would have a small menu for people on special diets.  Thanks!"
Katherine R.,"Chicago, IL",44,159,141,5.0,6/22/2013,We sat outside today here and after shopping for summer clothes in the Square we enjoyed the tall large glasses of iced coffee with Splenda and warming the butter under the hot bread to spread it through out the slice.  Mom is teaching me to keep cool with the excitement of eating so I focus on the plates presentation which were cool looking with fries in a silver cup hugged in paper type of wrapping so cute with a garden burger.   The bun was buttery and I like cold vegetables such as raw onion slices and cole slaw crisp and curtious to dress my veggie burger.  Dad and mom shared a fish basket and a Chicken parmesian with marinara sauce in a cute little dish.  We topped it all with a negoiciated plan on a slice of Mango cheesecake after our meal.  There was the right amount of whip cream and strong mango flavoring.  Loved it. The outside area is creative and elegant in décor and design.  The service was fun and youthful with tidy servers who work hard through the long hours of serving food and people a food selection from a very long menu of wonderful food.
Marie K.,"Oak Forest, IL",0,3,,5.0,1/28/2013,"I was impressed by the professionalism of the gentleman who seated us. He walked us to a table for 2 at lunch time and there was a baby in a high chair screaming and he politely turned around and asked... Would you like a booth?   The server Megan was bubbly, knowledgeable and served us in a very timely manner. She kept our soft drinks refilled and conversed with us nicely!!! She offered recommendations on how to refrigerate our take home cheesecakes.    She was a very good server for being quite young!!!  The food was fantastic.   The avacado egg rolls are to die for !!! My friend and I both ordered healthy sized salads and they were huge!!! Very satisfied!!! Great experience overall!!!"
Steve F.,"Park Forest, IL",153,9,23,4.0,10/18/2013,"First time going there for my B-day  on a Saturday, so was prepared for a long wait, but wasn't bad at all. The atmosphere was pleasing enough to keep me interested. Even though they're known for cheesecake, I have to admit the food was very tasty! Had the Steak Diane & Crusted Salmon. Yum!"
Rory W.,"Minooka, IL",0,3,,1.0,1/31/2016,"We went at 5:00pm on a Saturday. They told us the wait would be about 45 minutes which is no problem because we just walked around the mall. A man introduced himself and took our order but explained that he was not our waiter, he was filling in while our waitress was on break. We ordered Spinach Dip to start. It was good but served with tortilla chips and a side of salsa. Every table gets bread and butter but they ran out when we got there.  Food: We ordered Garlic Noodles, Chicken Lettuce Wrap Tacos, and Baja Chicken Tacos.  One server came out with the Noodles after about 15 minutes. A different server came out with the Chicken Lettuce Wraps about 5 minutes later and said she would be right back with my Chicken Tacos. She never came back. Our waitress came back to give us refills then left. About 10 minutes later she came and asked if I was still waiting for my food. The other two people were almost done eating and I said yes. She apologized and said she will talk to the manager and chef to make this right. She came back a few minutes later (30 minutes after the Garlic noodles came out) with my tacos but didn't give any explanation. The tacos were good but not spicy or hot (fresh) and tasted like they were sitting under a hot lamp for awhile. The side of beans and rice were both inedible. The black beans were hard and under cooked while the rice was cooked well but flavorless. Maybe I was supposed to mix them or add it to my tacos? I was glad that my chicken was good because the Lettuce Wraps each came with one little piece of overcooked chicken, hard and dry. The Garlic Noodles were good and we decided to stay for cheesecake.  We tried the Fresh Banana Cream & Red Velvet Cheesecakes. The banana cream had a good flavor but was frozen in the middle. The red velvet cheesecake was good. The total was a little over $70 for the 3 of us to eat. The food is on par with Chilis or Applebees but twice the price.  This place has a bad reputation and bad reviews for a reason. I will not be back."
Shelly M.,"Raleigh, NC",0,20,3,5.0,12/15/2015,"Have come in for an afternoon drink a few times during the week. If you sit at the bar and get a chance to have Juan G you will have a great experience! He is polite, friendly, and knows the menu. He can also make a great drink! I wish I could find employees like him everywhere I go! Customer service is not dead at this location :)"
Matchmaker Shelley T.,"Tinley Park, IL",0,3,,1.0,5/28/2014,"I've been to Cheesecake Factory downtown several times.  It's a favorite.   I expected the food to taste the same.  It disappointed terribly along with the sarcastic and rather cold unfriendly service.  Upside is we were seated immediately.  I could not believe that the same dish I've ordered for years did not look the same, or taste the same.  I also could not believe the amount of oil in every one of their dishes. When I asked server if the menu had changed she shrugged and scowled.   She definitely did not want to be at work as I observed her rudeness with other customers. The only way I would visit this location again is only for the cheesecake and take out.  Orland Park Cheesecake Factory location: has not managed to ruin the cheesecake as of yet."
David G.,"Hobart, IN",0,2,,1.0,7/23/2016,"I give the only star to my waiter , Jerry.  Awesome guy.  When we were seated. Our table was dirty as well as our plates that literally had food on.  When our food arrived (50 min later).  Both steaks that we ordered were well under cooked.  We ordered medium (supposed to be 25% pink). It was so bloody rare it was cold in center.  Please keep in mind I never send food back but this was obviously a different situation.  The manger came out and apologized   Just a moment later we received the exact same plates we sent back from the manger who said ""be careful it's very hot""  ....... It wasn't.   Looked exactly the same.  I gave up.  Got a to go box and cooked myself at home. During the time of receiving the ""re cooked"" food.  We had a stand in waitress.  I couldn't help but notice the ""I'm sorry"" look on her face as she saw what I cut into a second time.  We received no further apology, discount or any other means of redemption.   Pathetic"
Bilal S.,"Hickory Hills, IL",0,1,,3.0,1/18/2016,Decent if your here take the extra drive and go to the cheesecake factory in oak brook.
Debra B.,"Romeoville, IL",0,1,,5.0,1/13/2016,The chicken in the piccata was good. Came with a side of angel hair pasta that was nasty. It was stuck together with some of the pasta not completely cooked. It was a big blob of pasta. Nasty.
Gypsy G.,"Chicago, IL",0,52,,3.0,8/11/2014,"Food is just ok. I come here for the outdoor patio, which I love. And it doesn't hurt that its right next door to MACY's, my favorite store. I would probably skip it if it were not for these two factors."
Elena S.,"East Chicago, IN",0,27,11,1.0,3/2/2015,"The service was so bad. Example: (I'll go chronologically) waitress took our appetizers and drink orders. We never got any bread, but saw other patrons with it at their table. Came back with the drinks but never with the appetizers. I asked for hot water for tea that never came. I inquired on our appetizer to which she stated she forgot but wouldn't put it on the bill and it would be out quickly. It was out quickly but it wasn't cooked thoroughly, the inside was still cold. We had to ask for drink refills every time we needed one. They had a steady amount of patrons but all the wait staff grouped into a spot near the mall patio side talking and complaining. Our waitress declared out loud she was pregnant, grumpy and didn't want to be bothered. At that point we were pretty pissed. I wanted nothing more than to get the hell out of there. I didn't even bother to ask for the cheese on my pasta or any more refills. When the service is so bad it doesn't even matter what the food tastes like."
Lynn J.,"Chicago, IL",1,3,,1.0,6/4/2014,This place was horrible!  It was my first time at the Cheesecake Factory and let me tell you it will be my last!!! My waitress gave me sass.  My shrimp were overcooked and I was served salsa for calamari!!!  No worries...never again!
