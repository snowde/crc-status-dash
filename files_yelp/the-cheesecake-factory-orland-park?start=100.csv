Annie K.,"Hazel Crest, IL",0,6,,3.0,8/13/2017,"This is probably my favorite go to dinner place for a date night for me and my boyfriend but our experience Friday evening was one experience we will not forget, for staters the wait time was 10 minutes for us to be seated, we got seated in the smaller area where the booth is on one side & a chair on the other, we sat in between a family of 9 & another couple beside us, took another 10 minutes for our waitress, Dana to appear who just took our drink order & we order 2 ice waters & 1 cherry Coke with no ice to split among us, & she gave my boyfriend 1 water with no ice, she said she assumed to do no ice in that one because we requested no ice in our soda. Then she took our order which consisted of the chicken costoletta dinner with macaroni & cheese as a substitute for the asparagus with the mashed potatoes with extra lemon sauce on it & on the side. My boyfriend ordered the spicy cashew chicken with no cashews with white rice & extra sauce on it & on the side. Food arrived. The macaroni & cheese was a bowl of noodles with cheese sauce @ the bottom of the bowl, it used to be a square black dish with noodles & lots of cheese & breadcrumbs baked on top. Then my dish was correct for the most park except for extra sauce being on it & hardly any sauce on the side. Then the spicy cashew dish had hardly any sauce on it, we requested more & she brought out sauce that looked like a clear soy sauce for it. As we asked for more because the following one before that was incorrect she said it takes 5 minutes to cook more. As we waited he went to eat more anyways and noticed a gnat crawl out of his food. We then told the waitress about the issue & she sent over the manager who recooked the dish and ensured there would be extra sauce on it this time & for our inconvenience he took off the chicken dish from our bill."
Ron W.,"Palos Heights, IL",0,4,,1.0,3/10/2017,"We stopped here after an afternoon movie around 4 PM on a Friday afternoon. Needless to say, there were not at all crowded given the time. The hostess proceeded to have us seated at a tiny table in the bar area between 2 other occupied table which would have put us shoulder to shoulder with our neighbors. I noticed at least 30+ empty booth throughout the restaurant when we walked in. I politely asked her if we could get a booth and with a bit of an attitude she brought us to the only one that needed to be cleaned off so we had to wait a bit for it. Nice welcome!  My wife ordered the half sandwich/soup/salad ($12.95) and asked what the soup choices were. Our server (who was very nice) told her that the only soup was clam chowder. We have never been to a restaurant that didn't have at least 2-3 choices of soup on the menu. Since she doesn't like clam chowder, she substituted fries. Needless to say, fries don't take the place of soup. I ordered the Cuban sandwich ($13.95) which was OK. It was cut in half and only one half had ham on it. We also had to wait almost an hour for our food. I asked our server what was going on with our order and he said they ran out of bread used for a Cuban so they had to send someone out for it. He then stated that my wife's sandwich and our fries were done so it only should be a few more minutes. It was about 15 and the fries were cold and like rubber. We each had 2 beers, she had  Bud Light ($5.75) and I had a Stella ($6.50) outrageous! We bought a sliver of cheesecake to go (they are not large pieces) for $8. If the food was decent I might not complain about the outrageous prices but this place will not see us return."
lefvia m.,"Chicago, IL",2,122,642,5.0,1/3/2016,"Been to multiple locations of this restaurant chain, never been disappointed. Went there on New Year's Day met with a couple of friends, sat down and was able to spend the time that I wanted to, and was not rushed out. Who came out on time, and was very delicious."
Michelangelo V.,"Chicago, IL",1445,224,3749,1.0,6/15/2015,Honest review: lol this is the perfect example of just because the atmosphere looks like doesnt mean its gonna taste good. I been here 2 in my life i would never recommend this to anybody last time i ever come the people who like coming here are the people who think red lobster is a gormea restaurant. With the money u pay here u could easily go to one of the best restaurants in Chicago. Regarding the food this is the type of restaurant that is quantity over quality. They give u huge portions to justify the food tasting bad. Lol the calamari were so salty couldnt eat more then 1. The spinach dip jus didnt taste good it was way to watery so frozen spinach? And didnt have no seasoning very bland.  Chicken and biscuits. Lol gravy wasnt bad wasnt good it needed more though cause chicken was dry the biscuits were so dry when u ate it with the gravy it was pasty. Regarding there famous cheese cakes i tried many different types dont like any of them there way to sweet like one bite and u can feel like ur getting diabetes. I just dont think there made that good in general way to expensive too for just a lil slice. Regarding service its a joke. Like no refills? No utencils? N u forgot to get our bread after the numerous times we told u like evertime she came to our table wed be like wheres the bread like theres are the times where i wanna give no tip at all but im to nice to do that thank god theres no gratuity because they dont deserve it.
Rick B.,"Orland Park, IL",44,691,383,4.0,12/10/2012,"Pretty typical Cheesecake Factory - and that is a good thing. Perfect location inside the Orland Square Mall. Great place to wait for your shoppers or to have a meal after. This is the largest sit-down restaurant in the Mall, and the only one that really isn't fast food like the variety in the center Mall. While in a different location, this restaurant replaces the Ruby Tuesday's that used to fill the same niche. One can enter from the Mall or from the outside when the Mall is closed.  The menu is extensive, just like other Cheesecake Factorys. Nice selection. Since this site has been open less than a week, it will take a bit of time to work out all the bugs ... but good for them making the Christmas rush. They should do well. Follow up to come."
Brian J.,"Homer Glen, IL",0,5,,1.0,2/26/2017,"I called to make a takeout order on 2/27/17 at 5:42. I was put on hold for nearly 15mins before I hung up and called back to where someone immediately answered my call to take my order. I ordered a salad and a cheesecake which they said would be ready in 25minutes. I arrived at the curbside takeout at 6:27 and told them what vehicle I was I and they prompted that the food would be out shortly. I waited curbside for 20minutes before finally calling back again 3 times to no answer. I left without any food after waiting in total over a hour from when I first called and made the order. NEVER will I return to this location. This has not been my first bad experience here. They always, without fail, make some mistake at this location. This location seems extremely unorganized and incompetent."
Amanda R.,"Joliet, IL",0,22,,2.0,2/24/2017,"The cheesecake is really the only thing good here. The food is ok I guess, very expensive and cheap products. Very disappointed considering the price and seeing many friends go, I expected  so much more. 2 stars since the cheesecake was good, and the service is a joke as well, the server forgot everything I asked for and rolled her eyes when we asked for the check to be split. Never again."
Nadia N.,"Orland Park, IL",7,3,,4.0,8/6/2016,"Best cheesecake i ever eat spacially godiva, cheeseball also very good taste im goin to try all of their item on menu.prices are too high:( , good customer service."
Jasmine P.,"Chicago, IL",205,111,183,4.0,10/3/2015,My waitress was phenomenal! Stopped in for lunch and got the lunch bbq ranch chicken salad which was amazing. It was huge and only like $11. It was more like a dinner salad and yummy! The wait was shorter than usual and the wait staff was extra attentive
Jennifer C.,"Matteson, IL",0,4,,1.0,4/25/2016,"PLEASE DONT EAT AT THIS NASTY PLACE!!!!!!!I ate here yesterday, the food was not that great. Ordered the artichoke crab dip for an appetizer, the bread was so hard it was almost inedible. My friends steak was overcooked. The worst part was my friend going to eat leftovers the next day, he opened up the SEALED box the crab dip was in and a LIVE COCKROACH crawled out!!!!!!!!!! I'm guessing it got in there when the waitress brought the food to the kitchen to be boxed up. I will never eat here again!!!!!!! I would leave zero stars if possible"
Athan T.,"Homer Glen, IL",1,10,,4.0,7/21/2016,"Great service and food but bathrooms, referring to lady's room, was disgusting. As if no one cleaned in hours. Vomit in one of stalls. Smell was awful. Hopefully next time they will keep an eye on restrooms after mentioning it to front desk."
Bianca T.,"Homer Glen, IL",38,42,11,1.0,2/24/2014,"Food was amazing, but service was absolutely terrible. We had to ask for someone to bus our table, even though I saw a couple of servers walk by, look at our dirty dishes, and keep walking. We even stacked them at the end of the table just to make it easier for them! Come on. No one likes sitting in their own filth.  Our server was also not too friendly, barely smiled, and seemed annoyed with our family. I'm surprised my mother even tipped her 20%.  The Cheesecake Factory is a great restaurant with an awesome menu. Obviously save some room for dessert.  Just don't go to this one. Please. Go to Oak Brook. They don't treat you like you're just a shitty annoying customer at TGIFridays."
Tima D.,"Chicago, IL",52,119,,3.0,3/23/2015,This place is like the evil step sister of the Oak Brook and Downtown locations.  For some reason everything on the menu tastes different from the others. Lacks flavor and the service is below average. I get it...its attached to the mall and a much smaller location. Still...for what they charge they need to step up their game.  Ps. Dont order the pasta here. It comes out with wayyy too much oil.
Lisa L.,"Chicago, IL",5,146,19,2.0,3/28/2016,"Being that the location on Michigan Avenue has been around a long time and has consistent service we tried the Orland Park location.  We have been here 3 times (business lunches, business dinners, not by our choice) and all 3 times terrible. The reviews say it best.  This is a chain and this particular location lacks proper management or it would do as well as most the others.  Food orders wrong all 3 times, waitress touched our straws with bear hands, food was cold all 3 times.  I had a particular drink several times at other locations and sometimes they say they can make it sometimes they can't...hmmmm.  Well for the price, go to any other place and you will get better service and save LOTS of $$$$ Too expensive for eating at a mall. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is the cheesecake is pretty good and there are many selections. But....almost $10 for a single piece of cheesecake."
Julie J.,"Orland Park, IL",101,3,,5.0,10/18/2015,"I was disappointed that I could not make reservations for our party of close to 50 to celebrate my mother-in-law's birthday. The staff was wonderful from the moment we arrived! The two hostesses were trying to do all they could to accommodate our group and include the manager on duty in the planning. He jumped right into actions. As all of our guests began to arrive, we were all promptly seated. The wait staff was excellent and the waitress that we had was phenomenal! The food and service were both first class. My mother-in-law really enjoyed her 70th birthday celebration in large part due to the staff at Orland Park's The Cheesecake Factory. I had never been to this particular location before but I will certainly be back and will encourage others to patronize them as well. Job well done!!!"
David M.,"Joliet, IL",47,8,4,5.0,5/6/2016,"First time visiting The Cheesecake Factory and I was blown away. The food was delicious, the drinks were pleasing to the taste and the service was impeccable! In fact, the main reason I'm writing this review is because of our server, Demarco M. He was extremely attentive and made us feel like true guests. We are definitely going to return even though it takes us over an hour to get to the restaurant! Keep up the great service!!!"
Glorimar S.,"Chicago, IL",437,81,75,4.0,4/16/2016,"For a Friday night, I was completely satisfied with the service. I had the salmon with mashed potatoes and broccoli which is now my favorite dish! The passion fruit mojito tasted a little more on juice side, but still delicious."
Beeonca B.,"Chicago, IL",234,8,,3.0,5/4/2016,"We had a group of 7 people on a Monday, and the restaurant did not have many people. The service was very slow. How do you get your drinks before the bread and butter??? The apple martini was VERY sweet. I prefer to taste the liquor when I am drinking, and therefore I had to send it back. Now the Asian sake martini was a perfect blend! I decided to have the grilled steak tacos, which were superb! I was quite nervous trying some of the items, so I thought I would go with something I knew."
Leo M.,"Chicago, IL",0,11,,1.0,5/22/2017,"In fairness, the waitress asked us how the meals was and we said ok..because the service she provided was very good. The food quality was bad. I had the Turkey burger dinner off the Skinnyliscious menu. The salad was a soggy mess - took 1 bite and left it. The turkey burger was not properly seasoned, served with no condiments and was crusty outside & mushy inside. Asked for condiments which eventually came but burger was cold at that point (and it was not that busy). I ate half and left the rest. I literally had to wipe the grease off the bun ! I also ordered the onion soup ..it came cold. I sent back ..it came back barely warm but was not going to send back again. My son had the Orange chicken, it was also a soggy mess ..& the chicken blasts had little to no chicken. 4 of us ate there this evening. None of us will return. We had planned to stay for dessert but skipped that based on how bad the food was."
Sabreen Z.,"Orland Park, IL",18,20,13,1.0,9/28/2016,"I love Cheesecake Factory...but not this location. I've come here at least 4 times & each time...something is wrong. The funny thing is when i order the one thing I've ordered from every Cheesecake Factory I've been too...this location just can't get it right! I order the chicken avocado melt with everything no bacon & no bun. Is it that hard? I tell the waitress they mess it up every time so please make sure you write the cooks in detail what I want. One time they remade it 3 times, my kid & husband & couple we were with were finished eating got impatient & I had to take it home to find they made it wrong...again! First time the forget the avocado...it in the title how can you forget it? Then I get a side of avocado & bite into it thinking...why is it dry? Um wth is the pesto mayo?  I got so annoyed she offered to make it over since it's now cold. Thanks take it home & no cheese! I'll stick to the oak brook location. Thanks!"
