Jenny J.,"Hazel Crest, IL",131,170,449,4.0,1/18/2015,"Yes, I had a great experience at the Orland Park location. I went during lunchtime and the lunch specials were a great deal. I got a huge bowl of pasta and chicken for 12 dollars, and it was absolutely delicious. The restaurant was clean and the wait staff was friendly and attentive. I definitely recommend this restaurant."
sarah l.,"Palos Park, IL",11,76,1,2.0,1/30/2016,I've eaten at the city location years ago and also the Oakbrook one. Thought I'd check it out for lunch one day with my sons. Not impressed and crazy $$$.  Horribly slow service.  Will not return
Chi-Town R.,"Chicago, IL",2,21,15,5.0,2/15/2014,"I met a friend at 11:30a today(Saturday), Even before entering the restaurant, the parking lot was PACKED but patience is key..The restaurant was pretty full but we were seated immediately and the services was VERY GOOD! We were introduced and greeted by our server, received bread and beverages almost immediately.  For starters, we ordered the loaded potato bits, crabcake bites and on the suggestion of another reviewer, ordered the avocado eggrolls - All Delicious! We then had the catfish and the BBQ chicken salad for dinner - Also Delicious and a TON of food.. Of course, you can't go to The Cheesecake Factory and not order cheesecake - We ordered the Red Velvet Cheesecake and Tiramisu - YUMMY, too! All Good for Us!! The only bad thing is the size of the tables for two in proportion to the size and number of plates for the food - NO ROOM! WE ARE DEFINITELY GOING BACK~"
Laura G.,"Crown Point, IN",0,18,1,3.0,8/21/2016,"Ten of us celebrated a birthday here tonight.  We were seated on the outdoor patio and had a very good experience! Entrées were good, but those that included chicken (specifically luau salad and chicken lettuce wrap) were extremely sparse on the amount of chicken. Burgers were great, drinks also. Loved the whiskey smash! Our server was Amber and she was fabulous  - she took excellent care of us and was genuinely nice. She was very accommodating and made our experience really great!"
L W.,"Monee, IL",0,6,,1.0,3/15/2016,Food was not seasoned and service was horrible. Cajun pasta was served with a big CLUMP of pasta that was over cooked Server Rebecca was inpatient and rude and actually rolled her eyes when she walked away from the table. Manager was courteous and tried to accommodate.
Teni Z.,"Chicago, IL",1,22,2,1.0,3/13/2016,Worst food I've had at a restaurant by far! I'm surprised they let that Eggplant Parmesan out of the kitchen. It was salted so excessively that I couldn't eat past a few bites. My friends chicken was on the dry side as well.  The pasta that came with the dishes and the bread basket were good though.
Lori L.,"Justice, IL",77,70,,3.0,12/17/2015,"Love the Cheesecake Factory. This location is ok. Our waitress was friendly, however they messed up my order and she wasn't very helpful and acted like it was my fault my order was messed up. Everyone else was done with their food by the time my order was corrected. Will not go back to this location."
Curtis H.,"East Chicago, IN",146,6,,5.0,4/15/2016,Our server was Rebecca P.! And man did she do a fantastic job! She is super nice and I highly recommend asking for her when you visit this cheesecake factory location(orland) she has great customer service and you won't be disappointed!
Yuri L.,"Chicago, IL",38,43,2,1.0,8/27/2014,"Not the best location. I'd rather drive out to Oakbrook, where the servers are more attentive.  Alright let's get started:  The bf and I decided that after doing some shopping we would go have dinner. Having this restaurant there I suggested it. No wait time: I thought ""SCORE""! We got seated, next to us was a family already pissed off that they had ready been waiting 45 minutes for their food. On or other side was an older couple complaining that their alcoholic beverages were weak, and they have also been waiting a while for food. Apparently their server, which was also ours, went on a break.  It took about 15 minutes for anyone to even notice us. We got water, and no bread. I ordered the fish tacos, which completely fell apart, and didn't make my tummy feel so great after. I had ordered French fried on the side and they came late. My bf ordered a buffalo chicken sandwich, they messed up and gave him a chipotle one. We told our server about the mix up and the manager came and apologized. That took forever in itself (for my bf to get the correct order).  The new server we got was really nice, and so was the manager, but this place needs to get their act together. Considering they are placed in a mall. I don't like throwing money in the trash, and I definitely did that when I decided to dine here."
Lauren B.,"Lockport, IL",0,3,,1.0,4/9/2016,Horrendous wait time and hostesses with horrible attitudes! We were told the wait time would only be 40 min and when an hour passed asked to see if a table would be available soon. The hostess gave immediate attitude and was completely disrespectful saying that she never said it would be a 40 min wait that it would at least be an hour. About 2 hours later we get seated at a dirty table with a lawn chair brought in from outside.  The waitress was extremely nice but all other staff was snotty and rude. Hopefully the food will make up for the experience thus far.
Nadia H.,"Chicago, IL",1,5,,1.0,12/18/2015,Worse experience. The hostess needs to be fired; rude and snobby and paid no attention while i stood there saying excuse me to get her attention over and over while the other two kept their backs turned to everyone. The food was dry and not worth the price. I will never come to this location again.
Michelle H.,"Bolingbrook, IL",353,711,24,4.0,10/13/2014,"I once heard this restaurant referred to as ""The place where even the water has 1,000 calories.""  After reading and almost fainting over the amount of calories ingested in my first visit here, I made my second visit a calorie-control challenge.  Yes, you can find a healthy meal if you dig a bit My first visit included a shared appetizer of chicken pot stickers, which were tasty, a fairly decent southwest chicken sandwich with a mixed green salad instead of fries, and a shared piece of red velvet cheesecake.  The cheesecake was beyond description- layers of decadent red velvet cake, and smooth cream cheese.  I just wish they had a better cup of coffee to go with it. Second visit, the grilled salmon lunch portion was a major hit.  Fresh, lightly seasoned salmon, with wild rice and broccoli.  The Caesar salad as an accompaniment was lacking; Romaine lettuce with a minimal Parmesan and a scattering of croutons, with a small amount of somewhat generic dressing.  This time we had a shared piece of banana cream cheesecake.  Good, but not as good as the red velvet.  The biggest issue here is the service.  There seems to be a good deal of disconnect between the wait staff/food runners/kitchen.  First visit, we had a hard time getting someone to clear the plates from the tiny table we were seated at.  Second visit, the runner brought a regular salad out instead of a Caesar, and disappeared before I had time to notice the error.  It took about fifteen minutes for our server to our come around to correct the salad mistake.   Prices here are a bit steep, but for the most part, the food quality matches up.  What may lack in service is made up for in cheesecake!"
Dave S.,"Hickory Hills, IL",593,1203,15,4.0,8/17/2014,"What the cheesecake factory does very well:takes an ordinary dish like Shepard's Pie (which can be quite ordinary) and give it little twists to put it over the top and make it unique but not quite over the top. Which in my opinion is a good thing! Food traditionalists might be a bit disappointed in the little nuances they use to take their food up a slight notch.  The cheesecake that is another story. They must live up to their name and they do go over the top with their desserts. I have been to three different Cheesecake Factory locations, If you blindfolded me an put me in a chair at any of them, I would have an impossible time identifying the location based on the service/food alone.  This location is absolutely no different from the rest: friendly, knowledgeable servers, good food, and pretty flipping amazing cheesecake"
Oliver M.,"Orland Park, IL",1,52,,2.0,11/12/2014,Pretty good food but doesn't make up for the wait time especially with the holidays coming up. Service is ok due to this place always being jam packed.  I recommend you find something better and you will probably be eating by the time you would've been called at Cheesecake Factory.
Mya S.,"Chicago, IL",25,13,,1.0,7/17/2014,"I have to start out by saying I LOVE CHEESECAKE FACTORY!!! But this location is garbage. You would think in the suburbs it would be amazing but think again. We ordered an endive salad that had ZERO endive in it. The waitress didn't even know what endive was. I ordered the shrimp bistro pasta and specifically said over and over no mushrooms... It comes with mushrooms. I order my son mac and cheese, it's literally mac and soup cheese, and finally I order a cheesecake and a third of a cheesecake comes. I talked to the manager Renee who was a joke as well. She has no business being a manager because she didn't seem to give a deal about our terrible experience. Plus it was my moms birthday..won't be going back! Oh and they should have kids silverware since they have a kinds menu."
Ramsey B.,"Palos Hills, IL",399,538,21,2.0,2/17/2013,"I have dined at many "" The Cheesecake Factory"" across the country.  I'm a big fan of their menu and service.  The problem with this particular restaurant is the seating capacity.  It is too small for the location.  Why open a small version of the Cheesecake Factory at the busiest shopping mall on the southwest side?  Orland Park Mall is known for heavy traffic due to its popularity.  And the wait time at this Cheesecake Factory reflects the heavy traffic of shoppers.   The 90 minute wait time is not worth the wait, considering you can drive to The Cheesecake Factory at Oak Brook Mall and be in and out within 90 minutes.  Although the service was great, I will never again dine at this Cheesecake Factory, unless they decide to significantly expand their seating capacity."
Sazsha M.,"Phoenix, AZ",15,49,71,4.0,3/3/2013,"So many different cheesecakes! Yum!  We ordered food to go so I can't give any review of the dining in experience although I hear the wait time is horrendous! I ordered the Sheppard's Pie, it was not quite what I was expecting but it was decent.  The main reason we went here though was for the cheesecake of course! We tried 5 different kinds: Strawberry, Oreo, Reese's peanut butter chocolate cake, Godiva chocolate, Chocolate chip cookie dough. They were all very good, and very rich. Lot's left over for tomorrow!"
Melissa B.,"Frankfort, IL",203,680,112,3.0,1/4/2013,"I'm not normally a fan of The Cheesecake Factory, but on a recent trip to Orland (which I'm also not a fan of) I was hungry and didn't feel like driving home to cook. We decided to see if we could grab a spot at the bar and were lucky enough to have a table (open seating in bar) open up in under 15 minutes. The wait is 60-90 minutes here any time of the day! People are really waiting for this?  I was pleased with the service. They were friendly and efficient. Our food was OK. The fried mac and cheese was probably the best thing we ordered. The parmesan chicken sandwich came out with onions all over it (not listed on menu). Just a little disappointing when you are paying over $100 for dinner. Most importantly, the cheesecake isn't as good as I remember it. I think I will stick to drinks/Apps at the bar after shopping from now on."
Ed B.,"Mokena, IL",10,237,,4.0,12/10/2014,Probably closer to a 3 1/2 due to the fact they take no reservations and the wait is almost outrageous during dinner hours. The cocktails are expensive but they are well made. Martini selection among the best. The appetizers are above average selections. Not all the usual fried junk. The rest of the food Is quite good.. Huge menu. Something for everyone. And great cheese cakes with a huge selection.
