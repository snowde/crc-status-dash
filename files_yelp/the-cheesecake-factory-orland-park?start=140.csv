Frank J.,"Newark, CA",37,122,756,3.0,12/11/2014,"Went for a somewhat late night dinner. Was seated at a table for two but it was not roomy at all! Date couldn't fit her purse in the tiny booth along her side and be comfy! Staff was ok, but just for the time we were there I saw and heard many complaints (from other patrons surrounding us) about their food preparations. Since this was my first time at this particular ""Cheesecake Factory"", I became leary of this spot, quickly! We began to ask for the dishes we would to order and we were declined on 3 account because they had ran out! ): When ended by me just ordering a kale salad and she ordering and bowl of chicken chili. We enjoyed the small meals with, then ordered some deserts to go. Was looking forward to a better experience like we have had in the past in California!"
Jeannette N.,"Orland Park, IL",1,38,4,2.0,2/27/2016,Terrible service. Very long waits. Loud and crowded. You will wait a long g time for your food. I love hat they have a Cheesecake Factory in Orland but it's not a good location for this popular restaurant. Disappointed.
Kathleen C.,"Orland Park, IL",0,17,1,2.0,8/22/2016,Asked for a window seat/ told no because not enough servers / 4:30 on a Monday / the place is empty / one of the two hostesses offered a window seat in the bar area but that was sitting right next to someone/ I left/ no common sense / went elsewhere
LM L.,"Park Forest, IL",0,9,,3.0,2/6/2017,"Treated myself and my daughter to an early supper at The Cheesecake Factory, it was our 1st time, the wait was only 5 minutes on a Sunday about 3pm so that wasn't bad at all , very dark interior the washroom also. The hand dryer was a dark hole, so scary! We ordered drinks while we looked at the menu , coffee for me raspberry lemonade for my sugar loving kid. Coffee was ok, I could feel debris from the dishwasher on the outside of the cup, I'm a stickler for details. Finally our food comes almost burned my arm on the plates but no problem, I ordered a good size hamburger and fries that were perfectly ""hot"" and crisp, they forgot mustard but I never asked so my bad ! My hamburger was awesome, cooked med, tasted scrumptious the sides of pickle and lettuce tasted funny but the grilled onion was incredible, if I just had the mustard which came eventually, along with extra ketchup for my perfect fries! My daughter ordered the fettuccine Alfredo, too salty for me but she liked it. Now for dessert, the salted caramel cheesecake was good, the crust was a little tough but overall not bad,my daughters red velvet looked impressive you'll have to try that I don't like white chocolate!!!"
Brittany P.,"Chicago, IL",6,13,8,2.0,11/17/2015,"Hubby and I went on a Saturday afternoon. It was packed, we waited 20 mins for a table. Which was fine. Our waitress was not attentive and only saw her when she was taking our order and bringing the food. Not to mention our drinks from the bar was sour, tasted like the bar tender was filling in for someone. For the prices they charge the service should be much better. Along with bigger food portions."
Felice O.,"Noble Square, Chicago, IL",150,57,10,1.0,6/20/2014,"This is probably the worst Cheesecake Factory I've been to.  The service is great but the chefs are awful.  The food is pretty much an all around miss.  Baja Fish Tacos made the same as the Chipotle Chicken tacos... Barbecue Chicken Salad= wilted romaine with a sprinkling of corn, beans and salsa.   I'm calling for death to the chain restaurant."
Brenda B.,"Killeen, TX",0,7,,2.0,7/27/2016,"The food was not good. I ordered from the diet menu. The tacos fell apart and the food was not good. I was very hungry and the wait was ridiculously long. The dessert was okay, but I have had much better for less money."
David B.,"Romeoville, IL",13,28,2,2.0,10/15/2015,Waited for a server for 20 mins! 10 before other friends arrived and 10 after.  I guess a server wasn't assigned to our table...  The service sucked the rest of the night! But the cheesecake... That's what got the stars!
Dan D.,"Evergreen Park, IL",4,131,28,5.0,6/19/2014,"What can I say about this place that hasn't already been said? The menu has everything literally anything you could ask for so this place can satisfy the most picky of eaters. The service for us has always been fantastic, but the uniforms are a little more suited to a sanitarium lol. Red velvet cheesecake is a must for dessert! Perfect for a date night."
Dawn H.,"South Bend, IN",0,2,,1.0,5/20/2015,It was 11:03 on Wednesday and the doors were still locked.  I called to ask if they could open the doors.  No apology.  I then placed my order for the Godiva fudge brownie sundae.  The whipped topping was missing and the two wrapped chocolate pieces.  Again no apology.  I've been to several cheesecake restaurants and this was the worst!
Jessie S.,"Orland Park, IL",0,76,19,2.0,4/14/2015,"Overpriced and overrated. Dined in a few times, and have always been disappointed, as has most of my group. I was so excited for this to open in Orland Mall, but now could care less. Won't go out of my way to dine here again. Bring Ruby Tuesday back!"
mick v.,"Orland Park, IL",2,54,3,5.0,8/6/2015,"The table bread was surprisingly good - and two varieties.  I love the ""flat bread"" appetizer - three slices of pizza to satisfy the crave.  I've been chasing a good cuban sandwich for years and they nailed it, good quality pork (did not appear to be packaged deli slices)..  And again the bread was terrific.  The cheesecake was light, creamy and very good.  The only negatives:  my wife's bang bang shrimp was more like coconut shrimp.  It was prepared well, but we didn't expect so much coconut.  The table butter was individual packets - felt cheap. My favorite part of the experience:  our server Rebecca was very knowledgeable about the menu and very pleasant.  She really made us comfortable.  A server can really make or break an experience!"
Don D.,"Flossmoor, IL",196,4,,2.0,3/15/2014,My wife and I love the cheese cake factory's Kobe Burgers. However we were disappointed when they brought out this expensive juicy hamburger with a cheap sesame seed bun. We were flabbergasted. We are tempted not to eat there anymore until they match a quality bun with their quality burger. #disappointed
Paul S.,"Orland Park, IL",1,22,3,3.0,10/23/2015,"My wife and I decided to try this Cheesecake Factory for the first time.  The ambiance surpassed the $15 salads and $15 to $25 entrees.  Lots of wood, high-end floors and custom fixtures.  Michelle, our waitress, was perfect.  Knowledgeable,  polite and friendly.  The food reached out table within a reasonable amount of time.      I ordered the Cashew Chicken, served over white rice.  It was very salty and over sauced.  I made it edible by peeling the batter off the chicken and avoiding the drenched parts of the rice.  This way I was very satiated, proving the portions are generous. I don't believe in sending almost anything back.  Generally I never go back to the establishment.      My wife ordered the Chicken Madeira with mashed potatoes.  Unfortunately the chicken was undercooked with strings of fat visible through the sauce.  She sent the dish back.  The waitress and management were very concerned and offered multiple alternatives including the same dish.  The second plate of Madeira came back cooked as it should be.  It was very good.  Management paid for this dish.       As the management and staff were so good, our visit was saved from being unacceptable and the two of us walking away full and relatively happy.  We'll go back for another try.  Stay tuned."
Louie N.,"Chicago, IL",63,205,980,1.0,3/13/2015,"This is the worse Cheesecake Factory I have been to.  I decided to use a gift card I had for a while since they are always busy on the weekend.  Most places in Orland Park are decent to eat at so I wouldn't expect the same; boy was I wrong.  I went with a guest and the hostess was decent.  She sat us down in a timely manner.  A minute later a female server, Michelle, showed up and asked for our drink order.  So far so good.  Then the waitress took our order.  She was short and snippy.  I thought it was me but my husband noticed it too.  As she was walking by a fat bread server, Bishop, and he threw the bread on the table which was slippery and almost fell off the table.  The general manager, Alex, delivered the appetizers next and the the 2 servers were looking at my table laughing.  It left a bad taste in my mouth so we described the situation to the GM and store manager but no recourse or sincere apology to make us stay there so we requested his manager info so I could voice a complaint.  That's why managers should be older these young managers have no ""real"" training."
Gianna S.,"Lockport, IL",0,4,,3.0,12/5/2015,"Food, of course, is solid. Wide variety of dishes and cheesecake! Never have been upset with a meal from CF. Only things I dislike are the everlasting waits! You cannot book ahead which is a pain, since there a TON of walk-ins, making the waits extend. If you get stuck with a 40+ minute wait, however, you have access to the mall, which kills time, so that's a plus. Also, it takes a century to receive your check, pay, and get your money/change back, so be prepared to wait another 20-30 minutes after eating."
Traycee C.,"Orland Park, IL",21,67,12,2.0,5/10/2015,"I'm done giving this place a chance.... Mediocre service... Mediocre food that doesn't justify prices. Today is Mother's Day, thought we'd try brunch and treat myself to a Bloody Mary and what a disappointment. I was given a glass of tomato juice with a lime, white stalk of celery and a dash of hot sauce... Not even an olive!  For $9... They could at least put an ice in it to make it presentable.... Food wait was not great either... So sad as I really wished this lace would step it up by now. Off to Oak Brook next time I want Cheesecake Factory."
John B.,"Crestwood, IL",1,17,20,4.0,10/3/2014,This was a very flavorful and delicious meal! My wife had the fish tacos which she enjoyed. I had the gumbo.  I have had many different versions of gumbo and not all were delicious.  Theirs is very tasty with just enough heat.  The chicken was a little fatty unfortunately.  The wait staff were very nice; honest and friendly.
Rodney R.,"Las Vegas, NV",126,6,1,1.0,11/20/2015,"I only go here because it's literally across the street from my house and super convenient. The last time two times I was the the service was horrible!! Both times not busy once and night and once at 2pm; both times drinks came out after my appetizer, food was sub par compared to other locations and Grand Lux. The last time I was there our waitress never cracked a smile the whole time, Sarah I believe was her name. She was robotic, not a server, just an order taker, I've gotten better service at Mannys in Midway Airport. I think I'm about done with this location. There are far too many other restaurants here in Orland to subject myself to mediocre food and crappy service. Only good thing about this location is the ambiance is nice and during the summer the patio is the place to sit."
Staci M.,"Palos Heights, IL",0,5,,1.0,11/14/2015,During my lunchtime visit yesterday my food was TERRIBLE! I ordered the cashew chicken and the chicken was undercooked. For the first time in my life I was going to send my food back but the bartender never checked on us. Service was poor but it was obvious that the restaurant was understaffed. I am still mad that when the bartender noticed I wasn't eating my food she just gave me a box instead of asking if something is wrong with it. Gross food. Poor service. Not dining here again.
