Elizabeth G.,"North Riverside, IL",109,266,82,1.0,12/27/2013,"I arrived at approximately 1:30 for a lunch with mom and boyfriend. We were told it would be thirty minutes and were handed a buzzy thing. Cool. I can handle a thirty minute wait. And it was just about that. We took our time ordering because the menu is so ridiculously huge. We started with a round of Sangrias and ended up ordering burgers all around. This is where things got hinky. They bring boyfriend's burger out. Dude has manners so he wasn't about to start eating before the ladies at the table. Mom and I wait. Then we wait some more.  Mom: ""Please go ahead and eat before your burger gets cold."" BF: ""No, no I can wait. It is not a problem."" About fifteen minutes later, mom and my sandwiches arrive. By this point, boyfriend's burger is ice cold. The waitress feels pretty bad so she sends over a manager. . The manager comes over as boyfriend is almost done eating his cold burger. He offers to replace the sandwich but boyfriend is a fast eater so it was almost gone. Manager explained to us (and this is where it got confusing) that for some reason, they brought out boyfriend's sandwich but decided to remake mine and mom's. There was a clear lack of communication between service and the kitchen. They comped his burger so that was nice.  We aren't very likely to go back to this one. It was very strange and we know the service in OBT is great."
Robert C.,"Tinley Park, IL",0,73,,3.0,2/9/2015,"Visited on 01/30/15.    We waited 40 minutes for a table between 8:55pm and 9:35.pm to only be seated at a tiny table that would better suit two children.  The ""Southern Fried Catfish"" was okay, but no wow factor.   We ordered two strawberry cheesecakes for dessert, and we received a tiny cup of strawberries on the side.  What is that all about?  The food, the wait, and the overall experience was not worth $103.00 for two people.    Do not expect great food when the menu is overcrowded.  An overambitious menu usually means the food quality is going to suffer.   This restaurant also seems to be overcrowded with the younger crowd who do not know any better, but that is to be expected when a restaurant is attached to a mall."
Joe Q.,"Channahon, IL",0,5,,4.0,6/7/2016,The food and service was very good and fast.  The deserts were delicious too.  We will certainly return and recommend them.
Nicholas J.,"Chicago, IL",1,36,29,4.0,7/27/2014,"Just went here yesterday, AMAZING FOOD! I had the four cheese pasta. My friend had the garlic noodles. I gave it 4 stars because the woman who was filling in for our server because it was his break forgot to bring the second batch of bread that she said she would bring. I recommend this place."
Kamel S.,"Near North Side, Chicago, IL",0,12,,2.0,2/9/2015,"This cheesecake factory has by far the worst service on earth. Compared to other cheesecake factory is it a subpar. The food is what you would expect that any other similar establishment, massive menu. nothing is really amazing other than the cheesecake."
Kyle B.,"Steger, IL",42,30,,5.0,4/11/2014,"Went with 3 friends on Saturday night for a wonderful outing. About an hour and half wait which was expected for the time. The server (Kashi or Cashi) was jubilant and joyful. Great experience considering the craziness of a Saturday night.  I ordered the eggplant sandwich which tasted excellent. It was however very messy. Made me look unprofessional. My wife got a veggie burger which they were unable to bring out. They said ""The cook can't form the patty"". I can't think of any reason why a restaurant would be unable to do this but they gave her an entirely free meal of her choosing. Wonderful move Cheesecake factory!"
Truth T.,"Countryside, IL",0,28,,1.0,12/20/2014,"This restaurant is not for old people with eye problems. Or, the best way to get inside the restuarant is to go there with Flash lights and flood lights.  Both the Oak brook location and orland square mall locations are very dimly lit that you need the above lights to walk to your table.  Please down load the flash light app in your cell phone as you will need that to navigate your menu.  We really can't tell whether the restuarant is clean or any cockroaches running around as it is pitch dark inside.  Make sure you don't sit on some one's lap while attempting to occupy a chair. The waitress was very impatient and looked as if she want to get the f... out of the place ASAP.  Food quality is not that great but the charges are Great, I mean very high.  Avoud this place ."
Wendy C.,"Chicago, IL",0,33,7,5.0,6/9/2014,"Went to the Cheesecake Factory last night and it was amazing! The service was outstanding and the food was delicious and freshly made! My Bellini was perfect. I couldn't have been happier! Of course I had the buffalo blasts again and egg rolls and I ordered a salad and my S.O ordered the Cuban sandwich.  Our server Kasia was the best server I've had anywhere - and I'm not just saying that! I recommended that if you go there you should ask for her! She said her schedule varies but anytime I go to this location I will be asking for her now , for sure! Thanks Kasia!!"
Nicki K.,"Chicago, IL",50,42,1,1.0,1/29/2015,"YUCK!! Worst experience I've ever had. The food was horrendous!! They messed up my meal TWICE and by the time I received it, it tasted awful to where I couldn't even stomach it. The food is extremely overpriced and of extremely poor quality. DO NOT waste your time. I highly recommend Cooper's Hawk if this is the type of food you're looking for. You'll receive WAY better quality service and food that isn't overpriced!"
Abby K.,"Palatine, IL",0,13,,3.0,5/14/2016,"Went there twice now. Both times disappointed with the food. Seems to be more about quantity than quality. My chicken was soggy and coated only in egg, while my mashed potatoes were cold. However, the cheesecake was amazing. Skip the entrees, and go straight for dessert!"
Will A.,"Chicago Ridge, IL",0,24,,1.0,7/18/2015,"Horrible customer service, long wait times to place an order on the phone or pick up an order at their lot, wrong orders, not offering anything for their mistakes, also for birthdays they do not offer anything like other restaurants do, no free desert"
Liz Z.,"Chicago, IL",1,24,,2.0,1/23/2015,I have been to this cheesecake factory a number of times as well as the one in Oak Brook - this one slow moving and the staff isnt as friendly.  I got an eye roll from the waitress for asking for a side of ranch dressing.  Won't be coming back!
Christina J.,"Fort Walton Beach, FL",39,301,34,4.0,2/5/2015,This Cheesecake Factory was insanely busy but as always the Cheesecake is to die for. I didn't really like the Lemon Raspberry flavor but my go to Mango Key Lime Cheesecake never fails my sweet tooth.
Lana S.,"Frankfort, IL",0,9,5,3.0,9/8/2015,"Unfortunately, this location is a hit or miss. The quality of the food depends on which chef is cooking your food at the time of your visit. I've had wonderful experiences (food cooked to perfection) and I've had terrible experiences (burnt chicken, undercooked grilled salmon, salty Louisiana chicken pasta). I guess I enjoyed trying my luck. Fortunately, in my experience, the actual cheesecakes have been delicious."
Veronica H.,"Chicago, IL",0,15,28,1.0,2/11/2016,"Went on a Thursday and for a Thursday night they were pretty packed. But we were seated almost right away. Overall service was good. But the food .....geesh. If I could do a 1/2 star I would. My drink (a simple Gina and tonic) didn't even taste like it had anything....like nothing. I actually had to ask her if she made me a lime water. Who can mess up a gin and tonic ???? All three kids were pretty pleased with the meal. Husband ordered the ckn and shrimp gumbo. It should be renamed rice gumbo. Hardly any meat and the rice was undercooked. I had the fish tacos. The black beans had absolutely NO taste to them. I pretty much had to salt them down. My rice was flavorless and undercooked as well. The tacos were ok and perfect size but lacked flavor. It said it came with like a slaw, but it was beyond lacking. We will not be back. Save your money and go to any of the other Orland park restaurants."
Kara L.,"Chicago, IL",0,5,,2.0,5/10/2016,"In general, the service here is not great. When dining in, it takes forever for someone to come to your table. I just recently called to place a to-go order and they kept me on hold for nearly 20 minutes. I even hung up and called back, assuming they had forgotten about me, and they unapologetically continued the hold. I don't plan on frequenting this place often, which is a shame, because I like their food."
Joe A.,"Chicago Heights, IL",1,20,,1.0,8/31/2013,"I'm giving Cheesecake Factory a one-star because I know their food and their concept are better than this ""operation"" they have going in Orland Park.  Calabasas.. you need to get into this store and fix it, ASAP. First, the people on here knocking the food don't know what they're talking about.  The food at the Cheesecake Factory is better than most places in the area.  The Cuban Sandwich, Louisiana Pasta.. it's always good every time I go. Here goes... I'm tired of waiting 25 minutes for a burger and 24 minutes for a freaking appetizer.  This was my experience in consecutive visits. In the first visit, when I brought up that I had been waiting for 20 minutes for my burger, the latino gentleman bartending actually argued with me!  ""It's only been 16 minutes sir.""  Guess what?  It says what time the order was entered into the computer on the check!  It was sitting right there in front of me. This time, I am sitting there hungry yesterday waiting on a tex mex egg roll.  I'm reading something on my phone when I realize it's been 20 minutes.  I kind of look at the bartender as if to say, ""really.""   PAUSE!  SHE should not be waiting 20 minutes for someone to get an appetizer out.  I've worked in restaurants, even as the manager of a PF Changs.  When a ticket time on an appetizer reaches 8 minutes, there should be a sense of urgency.  By the way, this place was far from packed, so it's not like the kitchen was popped.  This is not a bartender issue to me... it's an expo issue.  Someone should have been in that window after ten minutes wondering what the heck was going on with my appetizer. So, to Kathy's credit (I think that was her name), she actually asked someone to go check on it.  I'm not a big fan of corporate restaurants making me feel like it's the bartenders problem .. like it's her responsibility to tend bar AND get appetizers out of the window in less than 24 minutes.  That's when it's time for a manager to be DOING SOMETHING.. not just walking around chatting with employees.  More on that later... So, I'm not arguing with bartenders anymore.  I took the ticket right to the front desk and asked for a manager.  At this point I was irate, because of the last visit and this visit.  When the blonde girl asked me a question after she told me she was getting a manager, I looked right past her because I didn't want to lose it.. she stares at me for a few seconds and then gives this whatever sigh. The manager comes up and I give him the ticket and say, ""here, I've been waiting on this for 23 minutes.""  Not my responsibility to have this protracted conversation with the guy.  I gave him the essential info.  This taller, white, blondish, possibly red-haired balding guy replies, ""what is it?""  Seriously?  I just handed you a ticket with two food items on them.  What else could it be?  How about, those two items?  So I walk back and sit down and my food actually was there. The bartenders were nice and really, really attentive after that.  They kinda realized I was beyond pissed.  Look, I worked at a Cheesecake in grad school in San Jose, CA.  We rocked the house.  We had to work so fast that at the end of your shift you felt like your head was gonna fall off.  I lost 60 lbs. that summer running my rear end off.  So, I have no tolerance for appetizers that take 2.5 times as long as they should take MAX.  Especially since even with happy hour prices, a coke, fries and tex mex egg rolls was $17 after tip (I did leave $4). The manager never came by.  He never went to the kitchen, asked what was up, and then came back to the bar to say ""hey, sorry about that.""  Had he come by, said sorry, and maybe taken one thing off the bill, I still would have been mad.  Even if he took nothing off the bill (which is really just the only way a restaurant can SHOW they're sorry about bad service), but seemed to be genuinely handling it, great.  But all he was interested in doing was chilling in between the kitchen and host stand. I spent $50 a month here at least and encouraged people to go.  Now, not only will I do neither (of course I'm going to go to Cheesecake Factory, but OTHER LOCATIONS), I will actively go out of my WAY to make sure that if anyone I know goes here, they are forewarned. Calabasas... get out here and do something.  The opening of this place has been an unmitigated disaster for CF's normally high standards."
Erick D.,"Justice, IL",5,5,,4.0,12/30/2014,"First time there and I thoroughly enjoyed myself. The bread is unbelievable, Cheesecake is Delicious and the salads were the bomb, everything was fairly priced. I would definitely go again"
Kae H.,"Orlando, FL",66,207,85,4.0,8/28/2013,"Love me some cheesecake factory! The menu is ginormous yet everything I've ever had has come out great! The staff really work together to keep the customers happy, including filling others drinks and taking away dirty dishes.They also have a huge ""skinnylicious"" menu that features meals under 600 calories, 300 calories, etc. Everything is good, but my husband and I usually order salads off the skinnylicious menu (endive salad for me, beet salad for him) and then share the pear and blue cheese flat bread (so good!). We kind of have this down to a science. The bill comes out cheap and we aren't overstuffed. We avoid the cheesecake because we try to eat a little healthier, but I've definitely tried many of them and they're delicious (how can they not??). The pineapple upside-down cheesecake is my favorite!"
April S.,"Tinley Park, IL",2,29,8,1.0,6/7/2015,Not at all pleased! Food was good drinks were extremely expensive. My group of four paid our 240 bill and tipped $55 dollars well the waiter came back with 50 cents. Yes cents. I felt so bad thinking I had made a mistake especially sense I use to be in the bartending and waitressing industry for 8yrs. Well everyone at the table counted their money countless time knowing exactly what they brought because we knew it was going to be a bit of a pricey night. Well we ended up tipping $105 dollars. And the waiter just laughed in our faces when we asked him about it. Congrats your restaurant just lost customers and fantastic tippers for your staff.
