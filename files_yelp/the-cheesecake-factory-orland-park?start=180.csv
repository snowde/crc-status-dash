Mrs R.,"Chicago, IL",0,1,,1.0,11/7/2014,"Let me just start by saying that I am 8 months pregnant so the incident that occurred at this Cheesecake Factory was beyond disturbing for my husband and I.  I ordered one of my faves, the shrimp scampi and my husband ordered the chicken bellagio. We regularly go to the Cheesecake Factory downtown Chicago to eat because this Orland Park location doesn't do so well with customer service. So, My husband chicken bellagio arrived yet there was a 10 min wait on my shrimp scampi because the order was mixed up. So we waited...... When I started eating my shrimp scampi I bite into a hard piece of something. I took it out my mouth and noticed that it was white and sharp at the edges. I showed my husband we quickly stopped the next waiter we saw to call for a manager. When she came, she asked for the piece of sharp object and took it under the light near the kitchen.  It was a piece of porcelain plate that broke off into my food. WOW! I was so upset. The thought that I could have swallowed a piece of plate with sharp edges. After the manager acknowledged this huge mistake she told us what it was and then left to advise the waiter to tell us our food order would be taken care of. I was pretty upset to say the least. I assumed she wouldve been a bit more irate as this mistake was her staff. To sum it up all we received was a sorry and a free meal.  The customer service here is not the best. I will stick to the downtown location, if at all."
Helal A.,"Maywood, IL",48,40,23,1.0,4/29/2015,"Pretty expensive and just nowhere near as good as the downtown location. Waitress seemed lost at times, not very clean. Cups and utensils were dirty. Save your money and time. Good was decent but too many red flags for me here. Maybe a cheesecake to go?"
Mohammad M.,"Worth, IL",0,1,,1.0,3/2/2015,"Okay  let's  start from the order  the came so late too ask us what do we want ,so we ordered  some nachos  and we found  hair in the first  Plate so me and my friends  ordered  orange  chicken  it wasn't  that  bad but we also ordered  steak flamin manana and we also found  hair in it again plus we found  a big pice of hair again on the plate where the put the napkin  that was a big pice so I will never go back again in my life there again  and the let us pay at the end too."
B W.,"Plainfield, IL",4,371,,5.0,4/6/2015,"I took my sister and decided to sit in the bar area at the high tables.  My sister is handicapped and she can sometimes be hard to deal with.  We had Kelly C. who was the bartender and could not be happier of how she treated her and also the service itself.  The food is always 5 stars as we go to several Cheesecakes in Illinois.  Kelly was more than accommodating and also gave us information on purchasing the glorious bread to take home.  All the years, my husband & I went to Cheesecake, we did not know that they sold the glorious bread.  My sister and I took a loaf home.   I hope when we go back that Kelly will be working.  What a pleasure it was to dine there!"
Matthew K.,"Tinley Park, IL",291,30,2,2.0,8/26/2013,"Took my mother here for her birthday, and we were both disappointed. First off, I ordered the crispy chicken sandwich. It came back very burnt, to the point where all you could taste was the burnt taste below it. I informed the waitress, and she apologized and said that she would have another one come out right away. When that one arrived, it was in even worse condition than the first. The manager then came out and offered to make me something else, but by that time I no longer had any appetite. They did give us a free dessert, which is why I gave two stars.  Also, ordered the macaroni and cheese balls, and they were good. Well, half of them. The others were significantly underdone. All-in-all this wasn't completely horrible, but for their waits and their prices, and compared to most Cheesecake Factories, this was way below the bar."
Graciela S.,"Woodridge, IL",15,49,17,1.0,3/12/2015,The food at this cheesecake was the worst and helped me understand why some people think Cheesecake Factory is over rated. My mac n cheese burger was disgusting. I don't understand. Usually oakbrook has this one made on point. It's supposed to be super easy. My margarita wayyyyy too sweet. Eek. I am done here. Woodfield and oakbrook are way better.
Amy M.,"Tinley Park, IL",19,5,1,2.0,6/1/2013,"So my sister and I pre-ordered a cheesecake to celebrate my mom finishing cancer treatment.  We asked them to write ""You Did It!"" with a breast cancer symbol on the cake, but they said they can only do it on a chocolate plaque.  We were skeptical about how it would turn out, but they reassured us it would look good so we placed our order.   On the day of we had our regrets and called to ask if we can cancel our order and they said that the cake had already been made so we couldn't cancel. Upon pick-up, which we had come late to, they said the cake was ready, but has to be written on.  So we waited about half an hour!  Pre-ordering is pointless! When the cake was finished and they showed it to us the plaque looked like a kid took a Hershey bar and wrote on it with some glue.  We decided not to include the cancer symbol to make room for the text, but that didn't matter.  The text was in 12 pt font crammed to the top of the plaque with a tiny smiley face in the middle of the bar.  By the time we got home, our house is literally less than 10 minutes away, the chocolate writing had separated and now says ""Ycu dill il! :)""  Awesome. Money NOT well spent!! Can't wait for my mom to see it . . . . NOT!!!"
Amanda R.,"Tinley Park, IL",117,67,,2.0,6/12/2013,"This place is a long wait for no reason.  The space is too small.  They should have thought about this when they built it.  The also should have though about a waiting space!  We went early on a sunday to avoid a wait which was fine.  They did not have the cheesecake I wanted to order...and its not like they sold out that day since we were one of the first people in the restaurant that day.When we finished eating, they kindly asked us to leave because we were taking up a table talking. rudeness.   I hear the wait is now down to 45 min from 3 hrs! now that the new and shiny is starting to fade."
Cynthia C.,"Chicago, IL",1,14,,3.0,2/17/2015,"I totally agree the staff at this location are inattentive. Is a shame because the food is above average than the rest of franchise restaurants. I do love this franchise, but at this location, the staff need serious work. They forgot my order, they took 20 minutes to take my order, my waitress seemed uncaring, therefore I felt a bit unwelcomed. Even the bill she brought was not even from my table. The manager was no help neither. But the food itself is great. I guess if you block the inefficiency of the wait service, you can actually enjoy your experience solely on the food. Just my two cents."
Maggie J.,"Alsip, IL",20,11,1,5.0,4/10/2015,"Great service and great food! Danyelle was our waitress; she was awesome! Very friendly, outgoing and knowledgable of the menu !"
Mr. Black S.,"Chicago, IL",0,9,6,1.0,6/10/2013,"This restaurant is over-rated. The food is average at best and over price for the portion. The service isn't all that great neither, not very attentive. It is amazing how so many people love this restaurant.  I ordered the Kobu burger; The burger was dried and over cooked. But it was my fault by ordering Kobu burger, I should have gone to Red Robin for the burger or a read burger place."
Carlie F.,"Orland Park, IL",4,29,,2.0,3/9/2016,It's way too crowded and a poor location.  Why in the world they would put this in the mall is beyond me.  The wait times are ridiculous if you're trying to come for dinner.  The service was fine and the food was good.  I prefer taking the extra drive to the Chicago or Oakbrook locations.
Fade K.,"Chicago, IL",161,65,74,2.0,4/3/2014,"I had a late night craving for some good food. Guess what? I'm in Orland park. Nothing is good in Orland park. And somehow I always end up going back to Cheesecake Factory in Orland Park after I say I will never come back here. But we are in Orland Park. .  I love Cheesecake Factory, but only the one downtown. I always get the Louisiana Chicken pasta which is very good. Their soups are always good too. For drink I'll get the frozen iced Mango. Really good. And as much bread they put in front of me I'll eat it all.  Every time I order these downtown it comes perfect, on time, and great service. But...... Not in Orland Park. They love getting things wrong. Get it together!!!  This store really needs better staff.  So if your looking not to gate Cheesecake Factory only go to the one downtown. And get the turtle cheesecake. Really good. 2 stars for the service. I say I won't come back but most likely I will hoping they'll get it together."
DiVina G.,"Chicago, IL",103,12,6,2.0,2/20/2016,"I've been coming to the Cheesecake Factory for a long time and in my family it's been somewhat of a special occasion (birthdays, graduations, Mother's Day) restaurant in which we got dressed up (presentable at the least) in anticipation of a beautiful ambience and incredible meal. Over the years this idea of the Cheesecake Factory has faded. For the longest the only thing on the menu I would order was the Cajun jambalaya pasta because it was a guarantee for an amazing meal. Overtime the shrimp and chicken dwindled in size and quantity and even flavor which has lead me to try new things there. Everything I tried has been somewhere between mediocre and crap. Last night I had Jamaican shrimp and chicken  with enough rice to feed to a small village and a small serving of small shrimp and chicken. The presentation was nothing impressive. My boyfriend had the steak n potatoes and the steak was low quality also. Even my slice of fudge cake was dissapointig which I had before and remember it being amazing. Another thing taking from my experience is the crowd of people going there. That's the only place I can thing of where I could easily spend $100 on a meal for two and b sitting next to somebody in flannel pajama pants. I'm not looking for coupons or freebies just want to bring to their attention that their loyal customers notice the lack of quality and until I hear otherwise I won't b back. Not worth the value of my money anymore."
Mike C.,"Lockport, IL",0,6,,1.0,4/3/2016,"My wife loves The Cheesecake Factory, and so do I, in Oak Brook.  We ate at the Orland location last night and it was brutal. The bartender tried to overcharge me, our table had crusted filth on it, and the food was only so so.  My wife ordered the chicken madera and after a long wait it came, burnt.   So we waited an additional 20 minutes for a replacement.   The waitress was very nice an tried to apologize.  The manager came out and apologized and offered to reduce the bill.  When the bill came it wasn't right either.  Next time I will just drive to Oakbrook."
Ryan M.,"Portage, MI",4,2,,3.0,12/15/2014,First time visitor. Enjoyed the food and atmosphere but service was almost felt like I was at an Applebee's.
Brittany W.,"Hazel Crest, IL",15,20,4,1.0,2/25/2013,"My experience here was absolutely horrible. From the time we walked in until the moment we left the service was sub-par. And I've visited plenty of different Cheesecake Factory restaurants before and have always been happy with both their food and their service. But I recommend everyone to stay away from the Orland location.  First the wait time is ridiculous. The hostess told us that the wait would be 45-50 minutes. We ended up waiting 1 hour and 30 minutes. When I asked the hostess why it was taking so long, she told me that my party had been assigned to a specific table but that the people who were seated there were taking longer to leave than they expected. This totally confuses me. This caused for diners who came in after us to get seated before us. Secondly, the set up of the restaurant is horrible. They ended up seating us at the tables that extended into the mall. It literally feels like you're eating at the food court. And Orland Mall is extremely busy. There are too many people walking by and staring at you eating. We didn't want to change the seating because we had already waited so long in the first place.  My friend had ordered the steak madeira and when it came she tasted it and immediately sent it back because it lacked seasoning. This is the meal she normally orders but this location failed to cook it correctly. She ordered buffalo wings as a replacement and we were told it would be out quickly. Her food did not come for another 30 minutes. We were all done eating at that point. We then requested to see the manager. We explained to him that we were dissatisfied with our experience and he argued with us about how none of our complaints were valid. He never apologized and then says that it is no fault of his or Cheesecake Factory that my friend didn't like her initial meal. I was appalled at his lack of customer service skills. Needless to say, I will not be returning to this location."
Tonya K.,"Matteson, IL",29,73,129,1.0,12/30/2013,This is the worst service I have ever received.  30 minutes for nachos and chicken sliders.  Sent nachos back no apology from management. Darryl sucks as a waiter
Yessi R.,"Chicago, IL",13,5,1,3.0,1/3/2015,"Went to have dinner with boyfriend we were asked to wait for about 55 mins. But we only had to wait for about 40mins. We were sat and took care for right away. Our waiter took our orders. We ordered fried mac & cheese for appetizer, which wasn't as favorable or creamy as I remember it tasting the first time I tried it, and we both ordered pasta. We were not pleased with our dishes. My boyfriends' and mine were both dry. Mine definitely needed extra sauce. However, we experienced great service."
Jazmin S.,"Joliet, IL",12,58,22,2.0,1/22/2013,"I was so excited for the cheesecake factory to open up closer to home since I've had such a wonderful experience at the Woodfield Mall location but all my hopes and dreams were shattered. I think the best way to rate my experience is 5 stars for the outstanding food and 0 stars for the service.  We arrived at 4:30 and were told that the wait was 1 hour.  Almost bolted but we came specifically to eat here and the kids were super excited so we decided to wait it out.   Since there was nothing else to do I started to watch the inside of the restaurant and noticed that there were many empty tables. It took a total of 3 bus boys to set up one table and I don't mean all at once, one at a time.  One to clear and clean, one to put plates and napkins, and the last one to place the silverware.  Each one was slow, and it took AT LEAST 10 minutes in between each busboy, ARE YOU FREAKING KIDDING ME!!!!??? So if you do your math kids, that's a total of 30 minutes for 1 table to be set up.  Like I said, I had nothing better to do so I observed. Once our hour wait was up we were finally seated and our food was brought out at a reasonable time (the firecracker salmon and the grilled shrimp and bacon club were AMAZING!!) but then our waitress had disappeared.  Of course we were too full for cheesecake due to the HUGE portions but we decided to order a slice to go.  I counted an additional 30 minutes for the waitress to bring us boxes, get our cheesecake, get the check, pay and finally leave. So a quick bite turned into a 2 hour show. I have mixed feelings about my experience, the food was great but everything else involved with our experience down right sucked!  I think if I'm in the mood again for this restaurant, I'll drive all the way to woodfield instead.  Get your sh*t together Orland Park location."
