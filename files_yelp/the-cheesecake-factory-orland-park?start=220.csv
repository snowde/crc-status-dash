Don I.,"Midlothian, IL",0,58,,5.0,11/8/2015,My wife and I dined here for the first time last night. It was crowded! My wife had the Cuban Sandwich and I had the Spicy Crispy Chicken Sandwich with the Chipotle Mayo. Probably one of the best chicken sandwiches I've had in my life. We will be back! Oh by the way the cheesecake was good too!
Mary Beth R.,"Orland Park, IL",1,26,1,5.0,11/4/2015,I love the menu at the cheesecake factory as one has so many options to choose from whether you are there for lunch or dinner. I normally get one of the large specialty salads and there is always enough to take some home. The cheesecakes are delicious and if the lemon meringue cheesecake is still on the menu you won't be sorry if you have a piece for dessert!
Rana M.,"Chicago, IL",24,48,23,3.0,7/12/2014,"Food is great and I love the atmosphere, but the staff drag their feet. Their misery makes it hard to enjoy a girls night out."
Joe G.,"University Village, Chicago, IL",5,3,,4.0,4/11/2014,"The appetizer mini crabcakes were absolutely delectable.  We then shared the pear, endive , blue cheese and pecan salad; it was also delicious. Perfect for two. And the service was top-notch."
Edward B.,"Orland Park, IL",0,11,1,2.0,10/19/2015,"AHHH!  You strike again!  Here is my problem, if you're going to charge that much for food and drinks, you better have better service than a fast food restaurant."
Landa D.,"Olympia Fields, IL",63,96,25,3.0,1/18/2014,"This was my first visit since it opened. I was only ordering a slice of cheesecake to go. The restaurant was full when I arrived, on a Sunday evening, and I went straight to the register. It took awhile for the cashier to take my order; even the to go area was busy. she (the cashier) seemed flustered and a little curt. I asked for one slice of original cheesecake. The waiting area was small, so I had to keep shifting out of the way for others to pass. It took wayyyy too long for me to get that one slice. The cashier was gracious enough to apologize to me for the wait, so I felt a bit better. I even left with a smile on my face...until I got home and realized that I was given vanilla bean...what the??? My first experience for take out was not the best, but I will return for a dine in experience."
Joe K.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,45,243,4.0,6/28/2014,I recommend the fried macaroni appetizer.  The stuffed chicken tortilla was very good.  Mango key lime cheesecake was great.  Ask for Jeff to be the server he was awesome and gave great suggestions.
Bobby O.,"Chicago, IL",312,257,187,4.0,1/1/2014,"Coming here time and time again for the cheesecake (pumpkin) I finally decided to eat off the menu. It was good...like real good. It does have a big menu which is usually not a turn on for me. I especially enjoyed the spring rolls and salads. For a ""chain"" restaurant, they do things the right way and the service is always good. If you have not eaten here you should."
Alisa M.,"Orland Park, IL",148,235,81,1.0,10/30/2013,"I came here again and the service has not changed. We ordered our food, the waitress changed in the middle of our meal and we were not taken care of at all. Our waters were empty and had to wait over 20 mins after asking for a refill. horrible service. corporate needs to step in an retrain all their employees on customer service."
Yolanda T.,"Bellwood, IL",117,108,71,4.0,3/18/2015,"My daughter is a big cheesecake fan and begged me to come here. I was seriously hesitant about going to this location after reading the reviews, but we went anyway. It was a Sunday afternoon around noon. And it was crowded. We waited for about 25 minutes for a table which was ok. I forgot the waiter's name. She was nice. Anyways, my kids ordered the buffalo wing appetizer and the garlic bread. I ordered the mushrooms. The appetizers were big portions. My daughter didn't have room for anything else after the buffalo wings. My daughter didn't like the cheesecake. She said she had better. I ended up eating it because I didn't want it to go to waste. I also ordered the shrimp linguini. They didn't put enough sauce on it. I would go again, but I would order something else instead. Their water is so good and refreshing, so why 4 stars? Because their table bread is terrible. The next time I go, I'm going to tell them to keep the bread!"
Stick-man F.,"Evergreen Park, IL",0,8,1,1.0,8/29/2015,"Well we had a gift certificate here. The burger was very good, as was the service. Unfortunately I will never come back because 1. My mushroom swiss burger ended up costing $17.95! That is absolutely ludicrous! And 2. the waitress confirmed to me that the ""No Gun"" policy is a corporate decision. I will not spend my money in an establishment that only allows criminals to carry weapons. As a law abiding citizen, I will not break their rules, but also I will not feel safe taking my family there. Crime knows no boundaries!"
Tomorrow S.,"Minooka, IL",2,10,1,4.0,6/30/2014,We  ordered the Kobe burger at this place and got it a bit late because something happened. On the upside we were definitely compensated. The atmosphere is nice and the staff was very helpful and fun. We ended up striking up a conversation with one of the waitresses and they weren't all about just working for tip. Most of all the cheesecake rocked!
Anna L.,"Palos Hills, IL",1,16,,2.0,6/21/2015,My family and I went there after graduation only because they were the only resturant open till 11:00pm.  The service was terrible.  The waitress never gave us refills or checked to see if we needed anything.  The food was good though.  I would never go back to this location.  The one in Oakbrook has better service.
Ben K.,"Hobart, IN",0,5,,1.0,8/9/2015,"I don't know where to start. We got there the hostess wan very nice. When we got seated is when it all rolled down hill first off we get a waitress that informed us that she was only filling in that is fine. When our real server showed up she asked us have we decided what we wanted. At that time we asked for water because we did not get any she then disappeared for about 15 mins, then she came back I asked her if we could get some bread she said yes then disappeared for another 20 mins. When she came back she asked us if we decided we then ordered I asked her if I could get another glass of wine which it never came in fact I got BILLED for one that never came to me. After we ate she asked if we wanted any dessert and when we said we did she rolled her eyes and brought us the menu. When we got our cheese cake she brought us our bill without asking if there was anything else that we wanted I was very disappointed in this whole escape. This is not how I see cheese cake factory as well this is really the first time that I had a very bad experience like this from there. I would not recommend this place to anyone if this is how they are going to treat people."
Z M.,"Oak Forest, IL",0,5,2,5.0,3/5/2013,I love this restaurant if u go get the crab cakes for an appetizer
Hope S.,"Chicago, IL",37,42,,1.0,7/21/2013,This was my first time visiting this location but I must say they were ghetto! We walked out because of the customer service. Would I go back...not likely.
Gloria B.,"Orland Park, IL",0,142,,3.0,1/6/2016,"We have visited both locations of the Cheese Cake Factory and found both locations to be a beautiful place to eat. A few drawbacks are the wait and also waiting for your meal to come out. In Oakbrook, the people are sitting and standing outside. We approached the desk to see how long the wait was and it was pretty close to 45 minutes. When we visited the location in Orland park, it was the same story. Not knowing that seating is available in the bar area, WITHOUT A WAIT AND WHEN A TABLE IS VACANT we thought for sure that we would be looking at the 45 minute wait time. A manger stepped us to us and asked if we would mind sitting in the bar, NO SIR we said and with that we were seated with many people wondering why  we were so lucky to get a table in the bar. Now you know, no waiting for bar seating. The food is very good, huge plates, the many different desserts are to die for. I have had many types of their cheese cake, delish. We do progressive dining which is eat  at one restaurant and then go to Cheese Cake Factory for our dessert and coffee at the bar. Very nice wait staff and the bar staff is just as pleasant. Parking is IMPOSSIBLE IN OAKBROOK."
Renee W.,"Hammond, IN",158,11,,5.0,3/21/2014,"Cheesecake Factory is the best restaurant out there:   PERIOD.  Yes, the menu is extensive but you can get just what you want--fish, chicken, beef, pork, vegetarian...ANYTHING.  It will all be great--every single time.  My favorite is the Shrimp Bistro Pasta, avocado egg rolls, buffalo blasts, tex mex egg rolls....face it...it's all good."
Pamela G.,"Palos Hills, IL",0,5,,2.0,8/21/2013,"A friend and I went to this Orland Park location and not a great experience. Service was okay but our order was not served as ordered, they needed to re-do one of our dishes. And we noticed this happening around us as well. We noticed several little flies, fruit flies buzzing around our area and table. It made me very uncomfortable trying to eat my food thinking at any moment I could be eating flies with my food. They were hovering around our cocktail drinks. Not good. I mentioned it to the waiter who said he would tell his manager (I'm sure he didn't) and no one came over to the table to address this situation. I believe the Health Department should take a look at the restaurants cleanliness or lack there-of. Couldn't wait to get out of there.  Creeps me out even still thinking about all those teeny tiny little flies all over."
Jenny G.,"Tinley Park, IL",11,15,9,5.0,1/29/2014,I adore everything on the menu and its very rare that I actually have room for cheesecake....however the service can be a little slow.
