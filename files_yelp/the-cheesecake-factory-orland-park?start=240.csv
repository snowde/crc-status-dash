Mrs. N.,"Charlotte, NC",0,20,1,5.0,6/5/2014,"Love this place, besides the fact that they got rid of one of my favorite dish (which are the polenta fries), my experience has always been really great, the food is really great, and I just love this place!"
Liz J.,"Orland Park, IL",15,55,23,3.0,1/6/2014,The Cheesecake Factory is like a Denny's for wealthy people. I don't like that it's placed in the Orland Square Mall. The parking is chaotic and there is always a wait. But great tip: sit at the bar you can order right away! Especially if you are not digging the normal 30-45 minute wait. The food is pretty average in taste but they have hug portions so anticipate a doggie bag. The service is usually slow I think that's the reason they give you bread.
Donna F.,"Evergreen Park, IL",5,104,,1.0,8/15/2014,Are we ever going to get rid of the fruit flies or just let them keep reproducing?
Brittany T.,"Park Forest, IL",0,3,,5.0,12/17/2012,"Just walking into this place was heavenly. You would never think that an establishment such as the Cheesecake Factory was in a mall. We walked in and the place was very clean, neat, orderly and set up quite nicely.  Our server, Joycelyn asked us if we have ever been to a Cheesecake Factory restaurant before, and when we said no, she gave us an entire rundown of the background of the restaurant.   We had such wonderful service, she  made lots of recommendations. I'm glad she recommended the chocolate chip cookie dough cheesecake because its my favorite now.  I absolutely enjoyed her service she was very helpful and attentive.  The only thing I don't like about this place is that it gets very crowded, in the parking lot, and dining room, so you should definitely make a reservation before making a trip here, but if you don't that's ok too. It's worth the wait.  I will request Joycelyn every time."
Christian V.,"Tinley Park, IL",0,4,,2.0,12/20/2012,"Alright, I understand to expect a wait for the Cheesecake Factory.  85 minutes in Orland Square Mall!!  Come on.  You get better times at Chicago's Mag Mile.  Here's the deal, the seating capacity is much smaller.  Only seats 200 according to the manager.  That is certainly not enough.  Still good food & server, though."
Shirelle T.,"Flossmoor, IL",11,21,,3.0,5/9/2013,"The new location that's in Orland Park seems like a very good spot but to have it in the mall makes this place hard to enjoy because there will always be a wait and it will always be overcrowded like most of their restaurants are. I've attempted to dine here twice but left because of the wait, but I finally got the chance to check out the Cheesecake Factory earlier in April and it was great. The food was awesome and the service was pretty good, I made sure that I went around 2 p.m. on a weekday and it wasn't so bad. I don't think there is anything that can be done about the wait so the choice is always up to the customer, if they can wait it out to eat then fine, but if they can't wait it's better to find another place and don't complain about the wait because there will always be one at the Cheesecake Factory."
Angelina G.,"Dyer, IN",81,12,5,2.0,12/27/2014,"I had gone here to celebrate my birthday with a friend for dinner and i was not very satisfied. the appatizers were alright we ordered the nachoes, not bad but we soon realized we had to stop at some point so we would not fill up. i ordered the Cajun linguini with shrimp and chicken. i had had it a year ago and swore it had like other seafood in it before but i guess not. the chicken was weird tasting but i liked the shrimp and linguini. for dessert i asked if they offered like a cheese cake free since it was my birthday, instead they said they had a sunday with ice cream. so i also ordered a strawberry short cake special with it which also came with ice cream. my friend ordered it as well. when the dessert arrived i was suprised the strawberry short cake was not even a cake but a layered dessert of some sort of bread, ice cream (huge scoops of vanilla) and then strawberries and another thing of breading and wipped cream. sounds kinda good right? nope. the cake part was not soft on the outside, it was hard like as if it was a biscut. turns out it was a biscut, it was not even sweet! that's not cake.... i was so disappointed in the desert cus i was looking forward to it. i did not say anything to the waitress cus its not her fault but it is very misleading. and the sunday they brought, it was so small, it was like the size of a shot glass.. it was insulting, the portion size."
Mia L.,"Streamwood, IL",278,141,113,4.0,6/12/2013,"The food seemed the same as other cheesecake factories, but Idk about the service. It was just alright to me. Drinks weren't refilled, food came out late but we got an apology for it. Eeeeh. And at first we were going to be seated in the ""atrium"" which sounds like a cool idea but in fact, it's the mall part of the restaurant where bystander mall shoppers snoop and take peeks at your food lol."
Brian G.,"Chicago, IL",6,32,2,2.0,2/10/2013,"Their food is always good, but at this location the service is brutally slow.   Being understaffed especially on a busy weekend is unacceptable and this location constantly seems to be this way."
Kristen J.,"Hickory Hills, IL",7,33,1,3.0,9/3/2013,"I was excited to eat here with my family as I have been waiting for it to be finished. We came here a few weeks ago, and were not too impressed. The food was great, but the staff can use some polishing. I am a huge fan of white pants, but not on this staff. We got a bit of a giggle at some employee's see through pants. Also, dirty white gym shoes kill the whole ""fresh"" look. Enough about appearance. Only other thing was I was excited to try the burger with the baked macaroni and cheese. When I asked our waitress how it was, she said it was just like hamburger helper. Despite that turn off, it tasted great."
Kristine L.,"Los Angeles, CA",18,52,39,4.0,1/7/2013,"I love Cheesecake factory! I was so excited when they opened this one which is right down the street from my boyfriends house. Kinda dangerous though! I went for lunch on New Years day about 1130 and got sat right away. But I've seen the parking lot around this place since it opened and its always PACKED. I'll be back at an off time to enjoy some more. I tried something new this time and had the corn fritters for an appetizer. I was hoping it would be like White Fence Farm corn fritters, sadly no. They're ok I guess. Even when I went home and put some powdered sugar on them, they still didn't taste the same. The dipping sauce that comes with it is pretty good."
lisa b.,"Schererville, IN",70,68,48,2.0,2/2/2013,"Delicious cheesecake obviously, however long long wait, poor seating originally they put us a booth with a chair on the side. Food was decent and i loved the green tea but over all high priced for moderate enjoyment"
k i.,"Yorkville, IL",2,13,1,5.0,1/26/2013,This place is my favorite of all chain restaurants. I don't go to any anymore only this one.
Susan H.,"Homer Glen, IL",0,10,,2.0,1/14/2014,"I was so happy that they opened in Orland Park it is so much closer than having to go to Oak Brook when I am craving some fried mac n cheese! We went there and it was a total bummer!! :( For one it is way too small. Cheesecake Factory should always be their own building. The fact that they are attached to the mall sucks! We went there for dinner a few times hoping it would get better since they have been opened for awhile but it hasn't. The last time was the straw that broke the camel's back. Once we finally got seated the plates were still wet from the dishwasher which grosses me out! Also, our silverware still had food on them! YUCK. So now even though we hate the drive we go to the one in Oak Brook cause we have never had a problem there."
Chris B.,"Lansing, IL",3,34,44,2.0,5/16/2014,i ordered a Caesar Salad it was okay the croutons were oily the dressing was sort of non existent it was okay but could've  been greater than it was..........my wife had  the Alfredo linguini with shrimp it was just okay noodles were thicker than I've had other places and the sauce left a bitter after taste. maybe we picked the wrong items but were willing to try them out again.
Tynee C.,"Chicago, IL",0,48,7,1.0,6/16/2013,"I really like the Cheesecake Factory.  I've been going for over a decade.  I've been to the locations at the John Hancock Center in Chicago and to another just outside of the Milwaukee area.  But this one in Orland Park needs some help . . . maybe a visit from Gordon Ramsey.  I went here for my graduation on June 15th and my son treated me to dinner. There were four of us so me and my best friend went in to do the 50 minute wait while my son and her son waited in the car.  We actually got a seat sooner after about 15 minutes in the bar area and I was thrilled.  Unfortunately, that would be my only thrill for the night.  Our waitress must have had some type of hearing impairment because she wasn't hearing anything we said. Here are the problems I had with this location: She set up water for two when we told her we were waiting for two more people to join us.  We got two more glasses of water and she then asked if we wanted two more straws which should have been automatic. We were given only two servings of bread and had to ask for more.  Why would you not want to give us bread since we have to wait so long for the food? Napkins.  I know the economy hasn't been the greatest, but why do we have to keep asking for napkins? It took about 30 minutes before we got our food and when we did it was only two of four meals, then about 5 minutes later one more meal.   The graduate . . . well I waited and waited and waited . . . and my party did not want to begin eating until I got my food.  I never did.  Finally the waitress comes out to tell me that the cook prepared a half order for me and it should have been a full order so I have to wait until he prepares it again.  By this time, I'm angry and told my party to go ahead and eat their food before it gets cold.  I went outside to collect my thoughts.  I came back and still no food.  Finally, I told my son to tell whoever brings my food that I don't want it unless it's free, and he did.  They didn't charge him for the meal but it wasn't even hot.  It was lukewarm at best. Then there was a breakdown in communication.  The manager comes over and offers me a nice slice of cheesecake for my troubles and we had to tell him that my meal had been comped due to the delay.   'Any who' . . . I still like the Cheesecake Factory but I just won't be going to the one in Orland Park. Oh wait a minute!  There's more. We specifically asked to have the checks split but she included everything on one check so she had to fix that.  Then I asked for a container for my food but the server came back she took my girlfriend's plate and boxed her leftovers so I had to ask her again because I preferred to box my own food. If you get aggravated when you're hungry and people are jacking around with your food, please do not go to this location.  Their service stinks to high hell and the food is not served hot. My son wanted to leave at least a small tip -- bless his heart -- but after we had a discussion about what customer service should be like in a restaurant he left this tip on his credit card receipt . . . .""customer service needs improvement""."
Kerri K.,"Chicago, IL",0,2,,2.0,3/6/2013,"well..went this past Monday (3/4) and Matt (i think that was his name) was our ""server"". And I say ""server"" because we ended up have 3 people serve us this night. After waiting about 10 mins before we were even acknowledged, that is when Matt told us he would be back to get our drink orders. 5 mins later a woman comes over to ask what we would like to drink, because Matt is very busy. Understandable, but it seemed that he only had 4 tables in his section.  We get our drinks, and order and appetizer, which they happen to be out of so we opted for something else.  Finally we actually see our server Matt and he takes our food order. Didn't wait too long for our order to come out, AGAIN not brought out by our ""server"" Matt except I had ordered a pasta dish was was ok. The sauce on the pasta was kinda hard, like it was sitting under the heat lamp for sometime. While eating he comes to refill our drinks and asks how everything is. Than we are finished and it takes about 15 mins before he asks if he can box up the remaining food. We could not make it more painfully obvious, clearly sitting there with our jackets on and credit card out! Granted we did not skip on the tip, my cousin and I both have worked for tips, we know how it is, but his tip would have been larger if all the above didn't happen The food was okay, the services was painfully SLOW! And I can see a someone helping you out here and there, but when we watch people get seated and our ""server"" Matt is there in a heartbeat, kinda just makes you more irritated"
Lou. K.,"Orland Park, IL",0,12,,2.0,1/19/2015,I've been here before and it was better then. Ordered macaroni and cheese and pasta Alfredo for grandkids. Just not good runny! I had chicken marsala way too salty!
Sarah E.,"Oak Lawn, IL",13,109,,3.0,7/1/2014,"This was the first time that my husband and I have went into any Cheesecake Factories. The waiter (I believe his name is Nick ) was good. I will say that this place is pricey. My dish was decent but my husband's not so much. He turned it back in and it was taken off the bill. We only paid for an appetizer, my pasta dish, a piece of cheesecake and a lemonade (I only had water and he had no refills on the lemonade) and we spent over $40. This place is too pricey for me. The appetizer was tiny and expensive. My husband seemed to enjoy his key lime cheesecake but it was close to $8. Something isn't right with the pricing."
Dw G.,"Frankfort, IL",0,4,,1.0,7/16/2014,"ABSOLUTLY HORRIBLE!!!!! Was here once before with a group of six and not one of our dinners came out together. They were a little busy. So we decided to give it another shot tonight. This time 2 out of 4 came out together. After the last dinner came out it was wrong. The waiter didn't believe it was wrong and we had to point out what was wrong. Then after another twenty minutes he never checked on whether the food showed up. After we asked the MANAGER  about the food she went to check on it. About 10 minutes pasted the waiter brought our check with the dinner still on it AND HAD NO CLUE the dinner was still not ready. After about another 20 minutes the food arrived. From the time we ordered to the time we left, with food in a to go. ABOUT AN HOUR AND 10 MINUTES. I have never had a dinner experience like this. I WILL NEVER GO TO THIS PLACE OR ANY OTHER CHEESE CAKE FACTORY AGAIN. GO ELSEWHERE."
