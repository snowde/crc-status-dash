Tonya D.,"Oak Forest, IL",108,43,10,2.0,1/28/2014,"We were told it would be a 20 minute wait but it was only about 10 which was nice. Our first server took our order but then we ended up with a new server (must have been time to go home) which was fine both were nice. I kept asking my husband if our food was taking a long time but it finally showed up. I aways order the stuffed chicken tortillas. My food was cold, you could tell it was sitting out for awhile. I took a bite or two and then the waitress came by and asked how everything was. I told her it was cold so she took it back to go into the oven. No joke it was like they just threw some extra beans on it and let it sit because I swear it came back colder. I'm very iffy when it comes to sending food back I get nervous that someone will spit in it which I told our waitress. But she convinced me to send it back again. When it came back she stood there while I tasted it, still cold. Even my husband said it was cold. I love how each time it came back they told me how hot my plate was yet I could pick it up and tell it was cold. No way was I sending it back again she said I could just eat it and it would come off the bill, I told her I didn't want it. I in no way think this was our waitress fault, but I do think she should have made sure it was hot the third time around. She kept saying how she told the manager each time it was sent back. However, a manager never even came by to apologize. Thanks for taking my meal that I didn't even eat off my bill though. I could understand if I ate half the plate and then sent it back but I didn't even eat a whole tortilla! We might have just had a bad experience but they need to get their crap together management sucked that day."
Darlene L.,"Tinley Park, IL",1,48,,4.0,6/16/2014,"I stopped in for dinner at around 6:45 on a Monday night.  The outside patio was busy, but since it was getting cool out I opted to eat inside.  I don't know if I was just that hungry or what, but the food was amazing. I started with the bread brought to the table (white & dark (pumpernickle?) with butter) and the fried cheese. I moved on to the crispy chicken costoletta and a peach bellini.  I never had a frozen bellini. It was amazing. The chicken dish was so good, and a very large serving of chicken with a creamy lemon sauce. It was served with smashed red potatoes and crisp asparagus.  I finished the night with a slice of the 30th Anniversary Chocolate Cake Cheesecake. The cake was a little dry, but I know it has to be firm in order to stand and work with the cheesecake.  Overall, I was a little unimpressed with the cheesecake.  The server was a little in and out. The area I was in wasn't that busy, but he didn't stop in that often."
Lauren R.,"New York, NY",0,11,4,1.0,7/16/2013,Not impressed by their customer service and rude hostess/wait staff. Ive been to this restaurant twice and will never return.
M E.,"Chicago, IL",0,13,,4.0,7/7/2014,"i've eaten here a few times and each time the service was excellent. The food was great - factory grand burrito was delicious and enough to share. My niece had the chicken with biscuts and gravy which was also very good and a nice size portion. I've tried several pasta dishes and they were cooked to my expectations. The cheesecake is to die for - nothing really bad to say about this place, other than you may have a wait on the weekends or during dinner. The outside patio is also very nice."
Cathy W.,"Homer Glen, IL",2,5,,1.0,12/10/2013,"This place was very dirty!  Table wasn't wiped off, the drink glasses were coated with ""something"", the bottom of the plate had other food on it!  Service was so so. Atmosphere was terrible, no space to enjoy your meal and have a conversation. Felt cramped and filthy. Will never go back to this location. Oak brook location MUCH nicer."
Cerene S.,"Chicago, IL",141,272,67,1.0,3/19/2013,"I was really excited to try this new location. It was a serious let down!!!!! The restaurant is entirely too small! I went to a birthday dinner with 9 ppl. If the birthday girl didn't really really want to eat here we wouldn't have bothered. We heard that the wait time is normally 1-2 hours, so a friend arrives at 4pm to put our name on the list. So we all figure OK, if we get there around 6 our table should be ready. Not so, it was actually a 3 hr wait and we couldn't all sit together, 4 ppl sat at a booth and 5 people sat at a table across from the booth. It wasn't the end of the world but we couldn't really enjoy everybody at the same time. And after all of that the food was just mediocre, nothing exciting, fresh, fabulous, NADA!  But we did receive a nice treat, when it was time for dessert we were surprised with a cheesecake that a nice man had bought for us. That made our night. But I doubt we will ever visit this spot again."
Kevin O.,"New Lenox, IL",2,14,,4.0,12/31/2013,"For a chain, this place is great. Huge menu and every time I've been here the food is very good."
Lia Z.,"Hickory Hills, IL",0,46,,1.0,1/10/2013,"I agree with a previous comment, if you could give no stars, that would be more appropriate. Worst restaurant experience ever.. And I'm a server and have been for several years. Initially on walking in we weren't greeted, we were literally stared at for several minutes until we said ""table for 2"". We were told the wait was 40 minutes, but we waited for an hour and 20 minutes. When sat we waited 5 minutes to be greeted again. Our server never told us her name and mumbled off some specials and asked about drinks and appetizers. We ordered drinks and she began to run off and we had to get her attention to order appetizers. When she delivered our drinks and bread she ran off again. We didn't see her for 15 minutes. By that time our appetizer was placed down on the table next to us and then given to us by that table. And still we weren't checked on. When our server came back we ordered and had to ask for refills on empty glasses and for straws. In which our server placed the straws in our glasses with her bare hands in front of us. Then our entrees came out and were placed on the table to the right of us on the other side. Clearly we were at a phantom table of some sort. We were finally checked on after we were sitting ready for boxes for 15 minutes. By far the worst experience I've ever had in service. Not to mention our appetizer and my entree both came out cold. We didn't complain at the restaurant, but to say the least, WE WON'T BE BACK TO THIS LOCATION."
Jim N.,"Orland Park, IL",15,44,7,1.0,1/6/2013,"We waited till this week to try it because I always want to wait a week or so to let a new restaurant get the kinks out. Waited 2 hours on a Saturday afternoon from 3 to 5 to sit down for a table of 5. First mistake by me.The sad part was that we waited so long and then it was about 2 hours to get our food and eat. The service is just too slow between courses. From taking 5 minuets to get drinks, to 30 minuets to get appitizers and so on. We had to send back two food items on top of that. My wifes meal was the Luisiana Chicken pasta the chicken was a parmasean batter. It came out cold. The chicken was acually cold. My wife cut up the pieces just to see if they would just re heat it or re make it. It came back with the same chicken on it. My onion rings were a batter mush, soagy droopy cold onion rings. Well, they put a new order of onion rings in for me and the actually just put the plate under a warmer and re heated the dish for my wife. A restaurant with these type of prices should never do that. Hell, even Mcdonalds re makes your food for you if it is wrong. So disapointed in this place. Long wait and over priced for below average food. Everyones dish was just barley warm at that.We were just so frusrtrated waiting so long we just could not send everything back Nothing hot. We sat there looking at the food just sitting under the warmer. They also brought the food out in stages. Two people got their dish and then we waited for the next two to come out about 3 minutes later and then the last about 2 minuets later. They could not bring out all at the same time. I feel like such a fool to wait then get served garbage. Almost $200 thrown away. PLEASE do not waste your time or money on over priced food, over stressed out servers, for a place that does not care about quality. We assumed they microwaved the dish to warm it, but the manager told us they put it back under salamander warmer after telling us they have no microwave. That makes it so much better. That made the pasta on the palte edges all dried out. I can not believe a place of this so called stature would do this. Then they gave us two free cheeseckes to replace the bad food, and when they brought that out, the server did not bring out new silverware with it, we had to wait till he came back to ask for some, then he only brought out two, just for the people eating the cheese cake. Any restaurant I have been to, especially up scale restaurants, with large deserts, brings out fresh silverware and extra for people at the table to try. And it was not just our table, he did it to the table next to us, but at least he asked them, do you need new silverware? Do not keep spending money here people of Orland. I know Orland is desparate for good places, stick to Coopers Hawk on the other side of town for quality and good service."
Lola J.,"Frankfort, IL",0,41,2,3.0,3/19/2013,"I have been to the Orland Park Cheesecake Factory twice, but this is my first review. The first time was actually before they opened, and i don't feel like they can be judged on a trial run.  That being said, this second visit was a lot better than the first visit, but I still think they have a ways to go. You will see a common theme in these reviews, and it holds true. There is not enough seating! I took my mom here for lunch on a Tuesday just before noon.  We were told it would be a 30 minute wait, but it was more like 45-60, and that was only because we questioned the hostess on why people who had arrived after us were being seated before us.  She said it was because they were in larger parties and smaller tables were not available at that time. I would understand that, except that we had actually spoken to some people waiting next to us and they commented that they were shocked at the wait for a party of two. They had arrived well after us and were seated first. I'd hate to think of how long our wait would have been had we not asked on what the problem was. Our server was extremely friendly, and unfortunately I can't remember his name.  The wait to get our food was slower than most places, but I love their bread (I wish I knew what kind the brown one was!) and the conversation was good so I didn't notice so much.  When I did get my food, I had asked for no caramelized onions and my burger seemed to have an excess.  Whether or not that was an error with the server communicating to the kitchen, or kitchen error, I do not know. I just shoved them to the side and did not complain since we had been there for so long.  Other than that, the food was excellent. I ordered salad instead of the fries and it was delicious and fresh and was dressed perfectly.  My mom ordered soup, salad, and a half of a sandwich.  The half of sandwich was about the size of a full sandwich (on the small side) and the soup and salad was good size.  She would have been fine with just 2 of those options.  She said the sandwich and salad was great, but the soup was a little too think.  I agreed, but those could just be personal preferences as we are used to a different type of tortilla soup than she got. We split a piece of cheesecake for dessert and that was the reason we will come back to this location.  Tiramisu cheesecake!  I've tried many of the cheescakes that the cheesecake factory has to offer, but on a whim decided to give this a go.  Holy moly! It was better than any tiramisu I've had at any italian restaurant.  I could easily get addicted to that cheesecake. I honestly hope that some of the issues that were had at our second visit is still just some kinks getting worked out on a fairly recently opened restaurant, although I don't think the size can be fixed.  When I go back, it will definitely be for an earlier lunch or really early dinner, hopefully with smaller wait times."
Loren T.,"Portland, OR",0,20,,1.0,8/16/2013,"The food was absolute garbage. Honestly may have never been served worse food. They comped most of it at least, and the waitress was nice, but for the same price I would literally rather have McDonalds. At least it's edible."
Ed M.,"Orland Park, IL",1,33,10,2.0,8/6/2014,"Wednesday night early dinner for 5. Place seemed busy, but not full.  Only 10-15 min wait to be seated.  Sat on patio, which seemed dirty (flies and food all over the floors). Menus were still moist, hopefully from being just wiped down with a clean towel.   Waiter took a very long time to take our order.  We asked for an extra minute to decide. He gave us 10 instead.  Once order was placed, it took over 30 minutes to get our food. Wait staff was not attentive at refills and keeping our table clean.  Overall service was a C- at best.   Time to send staff to hospitality and professional appearance training.  Or, at least send them to the Oak Brook location, where they could pick up a few pointers.  Maybe the kitchen was understaffed too?  Food was good, but not worth quality of service and the wait.   I was expecting much better from this chain.   Will not be recommending this place to anyone anytime soon."
Dave S.,"Tinley Park, IL",0,7,,4.0,3/28/2014,I was pleasantly surprised at the food quality it was good. We only had sandwiches so the cost was reasonable. The cheesecake selections were huge and very good. Something for every dessert fan no doubt! The only issue was the long wait for a table. Always a problem here
Lettty C.,"Joliet, IL",0,10,,1.0,3/22/2014,Just got back from the restaurant and i have to say I will definitely NOT be going back.  We waited for an hour and a half but since it was our first time there we figured it would be worth the wait.  We finally get seated and it takes  a few minutes for our server to greet us.  We ordered steaks with salmon and the bang bang chicken and shrimp.  Finally get our food the steaks and salmon was cold with no steak knives (had to use the butter knives to cut the steak) and no steak sauce.  I asked for more bread to have with  my meal and get it at the end of my meal. And we had water to go and the manager was no help either.  I left very unhappy and just home and our cheesecakes are broken.   The food would of been amazing if it had been HOT!!!!  IF YOU PLAN TO SPEND OVER $100 DO NOT GO THERE!!!!!!
Cherisse G.,"Chicago, IL",52,91,31,2.0,8/27/2013,"I agree with the service....so slow. My family and I (party of 7) waited 10 minutes of our supposed 30 minute wait before we got seated, so that was not bad. We got seated in a table where only one person can leave at a time because there is only one way in and out. Anyway our server took our drinks and eventually our order.  Now, technically there were other servers that brought our food. I've been to  other Cheesecake Factories and for whatever reason the food just was okay.  We also split two cheesecakes and the lime mango was so good and I believe Chris's(don't  remember the name off hand) was so rich and sweet but we enjoyed it. Our server brought us our check and we waited and waited a good 10-15 minutes before I decided to hail down another server to ring me up. I was seriously  contemplating ditching....And this guy would have been left short of a $200+ check.  As I was handing the second server my payment I saw my original server go to our now empty table and I bet his sorry butt panicked. He actually ended ringing me up after his coworker called him over but there was no apology or anything.  I have a feeling he was dragging his feet because he was guaranteed tip with a large party. Anyway, I probably would not give this place a second thought when I'm out and hungry"
Bryan H.,"Westmont, IL",0,16,,3.0,2/22/2014,"Three stars only because I liked the food.  The service was pathetic.  I ordered a pomegranate margarita with sugar on the rim.  The first one came out great.  I ordered a second one and they put salt on the rim.  The waiter said that he would get me a new one, but all they did was try to wipe the salt off and replace it with sugar.  It was really bad.  I had to ask several times to get my water refilled and it never was.  Even bringing out our food seemed like a chore.  It took 25 minutes for an appetizer and another 30 for the meal.  But the good is great and when they make the drinks right it's fantastic"
R K.,"Westmont, IL",0,4,,3.0,3/30/2013,"Long wait, OK service, mediocre food. Like someone else said, glad I didn't get stuck in the seats that are out in the mall - way too noisy & a thousand hacking, coughing, noisy people walking by.  Also very cold -near the outside door & it was 20 degrees today.  Waited forever to be checked on by very over busy server, didn't get water & finally had to ask. The tortilla soup seemed like is was a base out of a bag or can that they forgot to put the liquid in - so thick the spoon actually stood up in the bowl. Took it home and added 3 CUPS of stock & it was much better! Chicken salad was actually wonderful."
RJ J.,"Palos Park, IL",1,5,,5.0,12/9/2012,"We went around 10:55pm, just to have something small, drinks, and cheesecake.  Our waitress was Heidi G.  She was great, and it was only her third day on the job.  She explained the menu perfectly, and was great.   We loved her so much.  We had an egift card we wanted to use, and it was not going through, and Heidi was great the way she handled it.  She let us call customer service, to figure out why it wasn't working, and this was after they closed, and we weren't the last ones there.  She was so kind and patient.  The atmosphere was great, I felt like I wasn't in Illinois anymore, I didn't want to leave.  The cheesecake was amazing, as well as the drinks.  The appetizers could have been a little better, I would have rated a 4, but because of our experience with Heidi, it was more than a 5.  We will be back definitely, and we will be requesting Heidi every time we visit."
M G.,"Plainfield, IL",0,2,,2.0,1/21/2013,"I was so excited to try this place once it opened. Our wait time was 25 minutes on a Tuesday at 5pm, six weeks after it opened. There is open seating at the bar and at the 5 tables behind the bar....but not at the half booths in the same area. When I was in the bar area, I seen several open booths in the dining area. I asked the hostess if we could sit there. She said no...seemed like 20 minutes went by before someone was actually seated there. We were finally seated in last couple of booths-where it is opened to the mall. I was not a huge fan of practically being in the mall but was happy to finally be seated.  Our waiter and service was terrible. I asked how much the drinks were because they don't list drink prices on the menu. Our waiter had to go look and came back with an answer of $11.95. I did think that was a bit pricey but since my friend was getting a martini, I ordered one. Waiter comes back 15 minutes later with water and told my friend they are out of a liquor for her drink. (he called it whatever the stuff is that makes the drink ""skinny"")  Another 15 minutes and we finally had drinks. They were delicious!!   We placed our order once we received our drinks. Seeing as it took so long to just get our drinks...we didn't want to be there all night. I should also note that the menu is very long but I loved all the options. 45 minutes passed and a manager came to our table and muttered something to my friend. No ""hi, thank you for joining us or we are so sorry for the food delay..."" In fact I had no idea that he was the manager. He told her that her turkey burger was burnt so they were working on a new one. The food came another 20 minutes later. Huge portions and it tasted absolutely fantastic! We ended up ordering dessert to go. I also ordered a salad to go...super huge salad for pretty cheap, I think it was $6.   All and all the food and drinks were perfect. The service was terrible. When we finally got our credit cards back from paying the bill, we had been there 2 and a 1/2 hours. Our bill was about $65. My friend had a martini, turkey burger and slice of cheesecake to go. I had martini, chicken romano and a salad to go. I have heard from others that they had the same terrible service but the food was good."
Karl B.,"Coal City, IL",0,28,,2.0,2/24/2013,Went in for lunch and the food was barely ok and the service was terrible. If you want Cheesecake Factory Cheesecake I'd just hit up SAMs Club for one.
