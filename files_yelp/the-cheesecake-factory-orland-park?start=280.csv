J C.,"Homer Glen, IL",0,9,8,1.0,10/9/2013,"We decided to try this Cheesecake Factory since it is recent to Orland Park and it was my birthday. Other Cheesecake restaurants in the Chicago area (downtown and Oak Brook) are spectacular, but this one pales in comparison. There was a wait, even at 5:30 pm, but I expected that. Then, they tried to seat our party of 5 in a small both for 4 and they would ""pull up a chair"" for my son. He's 6 foot 5 inches tall! We were all adults, not children in high chairs. When I expressed my concern, the hostess told me she was sorry, but that is the table they were offering us, and if we didn't want to sit there, we would have to go back and sit and wait. My husband told me to drop it, and we sat down. Let me just add that this restaurant is VERY narrow, and the aisle my son was sitting in was the main walkway to the kitchen. The walkways are barely wide enough for two people to pass by, and him sitting there was not a good plan. Didn't they know we had said 5? Yes, they knew. About 10 minutes after we had been sat, the hostess came and said she was embarrassed, and moved us to a larger booth, very suited for 6 adults. Perfect. But then the new server and our previous server needed to have a discussion about who would serve us. Our previous waitress apparently won. She was not the most friendly...in fact, it took quite a bit of work on our part to get her to smile, then speak to us in a friendly manner. BUT, we knew this was a Cheesecake Factory, so the food was going to be awesome, right? Nope. Food came out and it wasn't hot, the portions were not up to the portions at other CCFs, my husband's steak Dianne was overcooked, and the food was bland bland bland. We are not into spicy or hot food, but, we are into food with flavor. Nobody finished their meal out of lack of enthusiasm. Our crab & cheese appetizer was the best part, but it didn't have enough pieces of bread. I mentioned it to the waitress and she just sort of shrugged. Really? We did order a couple slices of cheesecake. They were average size and not fresh. I get better cheesecake at other restaurants a couple doors down from this place. Overall, we will not be back. It's a shame. We were hoping our new, nearby Cheesecake Factory restaurant in Orland Park would mean we wouldn't have to hike out to Oak Brook for special occasions. Nope! Well, at least Uncle Julio's just opened this week!! Maybe their new location will fair better than Cheesecake factory. Way too much $$$ for the service, food, and ambiance (of which there is very little)."
Patrice R.,"Dyer, IN",33,6,,1.0,5/20/2013,"Our horrible experience......We arrived at the Cheesecake Factory around 6:30pm and the wait was about 45 minutes which was not too bad for a Saturday evening. We were seated, given menus and waited for our server. About 10-15 minutes later, the server introduced herself (Tracy--Traci sp??) took our drink orders and said she'll be right back. She returned 10 minutes later to get our appetizer/entree order without bringing us ice water or bread. She reassured us that our drinks will be served shortly. Another 20-25 minutes passed......NO WATER, NO BREAD, NO DRINKS, NO APPETIZERS!! She came back to our table and reassured us AGAIN, your bread and drinks will be here shortly but we ran out of buffalo wings and the macaroni cheese balls and a few more things she added. WOW! Then asked, are you ready to place your order. Are you serious lady? We haven't received water, no bread, no appetizers or drinks ordered, you're out of half the things we've asked for, really..... and you seriously want to take ANOTHER order from us!! I tried my best to have patience since we (me, husband and son) hadn't eaten since earlier that day. I understand its the weekend but come on. I expect the waiting time to be seated would be long, NOT the waiting time to be served some ice water and bread at least! If you're understaffed as I read this in other comments, then I suggest they hire more people or shut this place down and let another food chain take over that could handle a crowd. If you choose to eat at this place, don't go when you're starving because the service is brutally SLOW! We walked out with nothing in our stomachs and it was 8:00pm by then! Oh boy was I not  only starving but pissed that we wasted so much time. I'd rather keep going to the downtown location until I hear more positive reviews about the Orland location. They need a lot of help. Please iron out the kinks and managers need to do better with the inventory. How can you run out of your most popular foods? Unbelievable! Almost 2 hours wasted of my life that I'll never get back. We went elsewhere to eat and was very satisfied before the night ended, no thanks to the Cheesecake Factory. This was my 2nd trip here and still haven't eaten here yet SMH! Definitely not sure if I'll make a 3rd attempt. Too Pricey to be So slow!"
Good E.,"Chicago, IL",27,36,5,2.0,9/17/2013,"better late than never. ok so i love the cheesecake factory, that was until i visited the orland location.  disgusting and bland. i frequent the one downtown and old orchard normally. 9/1, i ordered the farfalle w chicken, my normal dish. got home to devour it and wouldn't u know it, the chicken was bland as hell. a ton of visible pepper on it but tasted like water. not even exaggerating a lil bit. barely any cream in it. a fucking waste of $18. also got a slice of plain cheesecake.  graham cracker crust was soggy. so i'm highly pissed at this point but was like ok. again i'm out n orland on 9/9 and the overwhelming craving for the dish hits me again! so i placed the order for the same thing once again thinking ok it can't be bad twice right? fucking wrong! this was worse than the first one. this pasta had zero sauce in it! none! pasta and water. i had exactly 5 small pancetta bits! not pieces, bits like for salad! it had 5 chunks of chicken that were again bland as hell! yes i counted bcuz for damn near $20 u expect ur meal to be loaded with more ingredients than just pasta! so at this point i called back to the store and spoke w gabriella and told her about it. she told me to bring it back. i told her i was at home in hyde park. this broad told me there was nothing she could do then. ""the hell u cant! u take the damn customers information and u replace their damn meal when/if they return to your establishment!  what the hell kind of customer service is that, especially when  i just gave u all $50 of my damn money over the course of a week!  i need someone to get back to me on this bcuz i dont appreciate wasting my money on soggy crusted cheesecake and an overpriced ass meal that's not even cooked to par. u may wanna check the cook bcuz this was around the same hrs for each visit 5:10 & 5:53pm.  so people u have been warned. long wait, sub par food, waste of gas"
