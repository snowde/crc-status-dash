Morgan V.,"Summit, IL",68,7,,1.0,8/6/2017,If I could give 0 stars I would. My drink came out with little to no alcohol. Who doesn't put alcohol in a Bloody Mary??? It was poor dressed there was no pickle no olives no anything. My food came out WRONG and the manager came and told me that it looked fine. What happened to the customer is always right??? My eggs Benedict had hard boiled eggs on top that didn't run when I cut into them and the other guest at the tables eggs were not cooked. Water was still coming out of them. She was so disgusted she chose not to even eat. Last time I will ever be going here. If you want to go to the Cheesecake Factory go to oakbrook or chicago. Orland parks will be closed in a year by the looks of it!
Apryl V.,"Bedford Park, IL",98,5,1,1.0,8/6/2017,"This is by far the worst Cheesecake Factory in the chain. You usually can expect to find a certain degree of consistency throughout corporate ran restaurants but, apparently this is the forgotten one. The food was mediocre at best. They made a Bloody Mary without adding the vodka! What bartender makes such a heinous error at brunch on a Sunday?? Our waiter was unfamiliar with the menu and had to keep returning and asking us questions regarding simple brunch items that we made no changes to. It was an aggravating experience and now I know why this restaurant is filled with servers standing around talking while the tables are empty."
Sara C.,"Elwood, IL",2,20,,3.0,6/18/2017,"The only reason they get 3 starts is the server and the manager. I can deal with a lot in a restaurant, but how hard is it to cook noodles? I ordered the shrimp scampi with Angel hair and when it came out the noodles were soo overcooked I could mush them with my fork. Sent them back and when the second order came, they were still hard in the middle and cold! The server was amazing and was very understanding and the manager even asked me if I wanted another entree. I don't know who they had in their kitchen, but they have to go. How a cook can butcher noodles twice 2 ways is beyond me lol"
Gina V.,"West Chicago, IL",198,289,1975,5.0,6/15/2015,I love the ambiance of the cheese cake factory.  Most of the people I know told me not to come here because is wAy to expensive and loud music playing in the back ground  I however liked the food. I was happy with the choice I made.  I have the fried catfish it was perfectly cooked and the side of homemade mashed potatoes were delicious.  I did not cared for the corn and the green beans it had a funny taste to them.   I was so over satisfied I did not leave room for desert and actually I did want to order a piece of cheese cake I just tasted my son's and my husband's. They delicious. For the service I give it 3*** stars because I had to ask our waitress for a plate setting for me.  I had to ask the waitress several times for extra lemon for the fried calamari and Tabasco sauce which she forgot.  My husband had to asked for more water.  The restaurant was not busy at all so maybe the server needs to get her act together she was totally lost!! I did have fun because my friend drove there and we celebrated her birthday.  Be cautious this restaurant is way too cold bring a jacket or ask to see if they can lower the temp.
Helene K.,"Chicago, IL",0,62,24,1.0,6/15/2017,"Went here to celebrate a birthday dinner told we are to wait 20 minutes, I'm giving them one star due to the fact of the lady in the front handing out pagers to the parties. She had such a attitude and she forgot to add on an additional 20 minutes to our original 20 minute wait time which doubled it! I have worked in food service and if you guys cannot accommodate parties in rotation of 6 or more when you are fully staffed!! But what made me give the one star is when the last same female hostess immediately sat the same size party of 6 that walked in 15 minutes after us!!! that is huge problem for a restaurant chain on a Thursday night! There was no greeting of customer service, and exiting from the front desk too! Please take into consideration that your guests can take their business to another Cheesecake Factory or any business in Orland park for that matter! This is totally not the way to treat people. Food is alright but your customer service is totally off and it killed the vibe of our birthday dinner! I have to applaud our waitress she really tried and her efforts were acknowledged by our group. Not to mention We spent over a good $200 for drinks and dinner! That kind of business deserves better customer attention!"
Tiff C.,"Bronx, NY",2,22,2,1.0,4/1/2017,"Spend the extra time and energy and go to another CCF. This place is horrible! Front desk staff sucks (cold and unfriendly), management sucks(didn't care that staff members were rude), food sucks (I have NEVER BEEN to a Cheesecake Factory with bad food but this one...smh)..."
Brianna B.,"Chicago, IL",64,3,,3.0,6/17/2017,"My first time at Cheesecake Factory and I loved my meal!! only bad part was the service.. very very slow, and my sister had to wait almost half hour for her fries and on top of that her food wasn't all that great. I would come back again just not at this location."
Rick H.,"Chicago, IL",31,49,2,2.0,4/20/2017,This place has really gone downhill.  The last few times we've gone the food has been pretty blah.  We only went this past time because we had a gift card.
Kathy W.,"Westmont, IL",0,11,,5.0,10/3/2017,"I don't frequent the Cheesecake Factory often and if I do it is the Oak Brook location, but I was pleasantly surprised. Service and food were great at the Orland location. Special shout out to Mike our waiter who was so wonderful! Thank you Mike for making this rare family outing such a pleasure. He didn't miss a beat."
Cher C.,"Chicago, IL",0,4,,1.0,3/26/2017,"Since I didn't have a CF where I'm from I was really excited about going to eat. The food, DISGUSTING my bf sent back his jumbalaya it was bland af it literally tasted like nothing! I had the steak and salmon meal it was mediocre. The egg roll app was good but other than that highly disappointed. Our server didn't even care we weren't happy she just took the food back and said ""ok"". Never going again."
Mo J.,"Tinley Park, IL",3,54,9,1.0,4/9/2017,Been on hold for 17 minutes for a takeout order. Is it me or the service here is getting worse. It's sad where this restaurant chain was an where it's headed
Darren S.,"Frankfort, IL",0,12,1,2.0,12/12/2016,"Service in the restaurant was good.  But the dishes were dirty, the food was average (especially for the price) and the cheesecake portions seemed about half the size as normal. A week ago, I tried to order whole cheesecakes by phone 3 different times only to be placed on hold for over 15 minutes each time, until I finally gave up. I usually love The Cheesecake Factory, but this one definitely isn't 'up to snuff'."
Fuad E.,"Orland Park, IL",0,2,,1.0,9/24/2017,Poor service the waitress sat us down with no menus it took 15 minutes for a waitress to get to us and didn't give us any complimentary bread. Overall this restraunt has good food but poor service.
Bre B.,"Orland Park, IL",0,20,,2.0,9/21/2017,"Their food is always great. But I've done take out the past few times and they have ALWAYS been late. I'll call in and say when I'd like to pick it up, which is hours before, and then get there and they'll tell me 20-30 minutes and it'll end up being 45. Ok, maybe it's Bc they're trying to match it up and have it fresh for when I pick it up. But! Last time I ordered I decided to just get Cheesecake to go. Called in around 7 to have two cheesecakes picked up at 10. Got there at 10:20, I still had to wait for them to prepare it! What the heck? It's sitting in the fridge anyways so there's nothing that has to be cooked. So even with simple orders that are called ahead they still make you wait."
Laurie B.,"Orland Park, IL",0,1,,3.0,11/19/2016,"I have always loved Cheesecake factory and decided to go for my 60th birthday.  One of my favorite dishes is the chicken and biscuits (the best in comfort food).  Imagine my surprise when I get served a plate with flattened chicken, a couple of carrots, frozen peas and a wad of dry garlic potatoes.. and two small what looks like bisquit biscuits.   no gravey except for a touch on the chicken.  I actually asked the waitstaff if they got it right.  I guess they changed the menu because California people wanted it healthier.  Thank goodness the Cheesecake was still good.  it would have been nice to have had the Manger come to the table so I could have expressed my disappointment to him or her.  This  is the Midwest, we don't go to the Cheesecake factory for healthy food.  not sure that we will be back.  When we spend over 100. for 2 at a chain we want good.  Our waitress was very good."
Evan L.,"Schaumburg, IL",41,2,,5.0,1/7/2017,"Went to eat there tonight for a first date with a girl. Our waiter Tim went above and beyond for us even though he was waiting other tables with 4+ customers. He gave his honest opinions of each item on the menu. Not to mention he knew every single Cheesecake as well. Getting back to the point, his customer service was out of this world. As a manager of a retail store I deal with customers every single day, and his attitude during the whole night made my day better. I'm sure this never happens, but please consider giving Tim a raise, or at least training new employees!"
Monica H.,"Manhattan, IL",15,24,4,4.0,5/16/2017,"First time we went 30 min wait (not bad for a Saturday night) waiter was a bit overwhelmed as she seemed frazzled, but the appetizer and food was piping hot, the cheesecake is heaven took it to go cuz we were full !! A bit pricey on certain items, but reasonable. I think they need more staff so waiters/waitresses aren't too overwhelmed. Definitely going back"
Celia C.,"Chicago, IL",0,125,6,1.0,1/23/2017,Nothing like the one downtown....Their cups always have a smell. The service is slow not a big fan.
Sarwat I.,"Orland Park, IL",6,21,18,2.0,2/28/2017,"We waited 40 minutes to be seated, and it wasn't because it was busy. It was because our server hadn't arrived yet. There were plenty of tables empty. We are now sitting at the table and it's taking forever to bring the bread, he brought our drinks and forgot to order two of them. Now he went back to the kitchen and never came back to take our orders, that was 10 minutes ago. On the plus side, our server is a nice guy, he just keeps forgetting everything. I guess today is just not their day."
Alicia M.,"South Shore, Chicago, IL",7,18,,5.0,2/1/2017,Good service good food typical Cheesecake Factory
