Ash M.,"Homer Glen, IL",132,61,10,1.0,6/10/2016,"Love the Cheesecake Factory...just not this location.  Every time we've come here, it's uncomfortably crowded (they try to squeeze as many people in there as possible), wait times are ridiculous (there's times it was up two a two hour wait and I nope'd right out of there). Service and food is very inconsistent and servers look annoyed and tired (I don't blame them, this location is a zoo). This was a horrible spot for the Cheesecake Factory to settle in Orland Park. They had little space to work with when moving into a bottom floor of a mall, and it shows.  The only time we enjoyed this location is when we were able to sit outside in the fall under heaters, away from shoulder to shoulder contact and having all sorts of people in my personal bubble. You know, outside, where we could actually breathe. If you want to give Cheesecake Factory a try, please do not let this location turn you off. The locations in Oak Brook and Downtown are much, MUCH better. We do ourselves the favor and drive farther to enjoy their food. I suggest you do the same."
Jeffrey L.,"Orland Park, IL",1,31,30,1.0,6/23/2016,"Ok let me first say that the food is great and I loved the cheesecake. Never had it until I visited. Orland Square Mall has always been a place that I have went to get out of my house and to pick stuff up. They have redone parts of the mall and they do their best. But when this place moved in? Ha. The restaurant sticks out into the mall! I can walk past and touch one of the tables. I don't think making a restaurant that used to be a bank was such a smart idea. Too crowded, too loud. Orland Square has gotten worse from this place."
Rocio P.,"Crown Point, IN",20,13,13,3.0,7/18/2016,I would have given it four stars but the portion sizes for entrees have been reduced while the prices keep going up. Good variety in cheesecakes which are delicious.
Z B.,"Chicago, IL",121,157,208,5.0,7/12/2015,"I'm really surprised that the rating for this is actually not as good!  Right inside of Orland Square Mall is a very popular restaurant called The Cheesecake Factory. It is famous for the cheesecakes. The average wait for a table for a party of four people is about 20 minutes. Sometimes it can be up to about 35 to 40 minutes. That's crazy for a restaurant, right guys? The service here was fantastic. It was quick, and my orders were right. If you get Paul for your waiter, your in for a treat! He's funny, very friendly, and personable. He was the reason why my experience became so comfortable and wonderful.  The food was really good. I really enjoyed my appetizer of Fried Macaroni and Cheese Balls. It had a nice and crunchy exterior. Also, the interior was penne noodles, which is different from your regular macaroni and cheese. I like different if you didn't know that! The interior was really good. The cheese was melted perfectly, and the pasta tasted great! For my entree, I had the Parmesan-Herb Crusted Chicken. I liked the tender chicken inside of the smooth and yummy chicken. The mashed potatoes for my side were great! There were actual pieces of potatoes in them. The green beans were pretty good. It tasted fresh and delicious!  My relatives and I looked around the mall and came back later for the cheesecake. I wanted to try the Chocolate Mousse cheesecake. There was whipped cream near and on top of the cheesecake. The whipped cream was delicious The cheesecake itself was excellent. The chocolate tasted phenomenal. It was rich and enjoyable. All in all, I really enjoyed my experience. I will be back here again!"
Jackee M.,"Chicago, IL",180,185,248,4.0,12/27/2015,"Parking is horrible. Took about 15 minutes to park.  We couldn't make reservations before hand so we had to wait 35 minutes for a table. So we walked around the area of the mall near the restaurant. We were seated after our wait and order drinks and appetizers. Both arrived fast and were fantastic. We order our main dishes after.  We had to ask another waiter for the bread basket because our waitress was MIA for a while. My dish arrived and I began eating. Not realizing it wasn't the dish I ordered. But I enjoyed it so I kept it. They only charged me for a lunch portion of the meal for the mixup. The menu is HUGE! But everything sounds so good. Our food was good, service was pretty good. I will be back. Oh yeah and the cheesecake is obviously delicious."
Crystal D.,"Orland Park, IL",5,4,,2.0,3/11/2017,"I come here because it's the closest location to me but every time I'm here I regret it. The service is garbage the staff needs some major revamping specially the hostesses. I asked how long the wait would be after waiting for 2 hours and the hostess snapped back saying ""we told you 2 hours!"" I went back to wait by the mall area and the buzzer went off. It was very annoying she could've told us we were next in line or something. The waiters are always overwhelmed it's so clear to see and the food is always average nothing to call home about. I rather go to the one oak brook but once again the location is convenient that's why I'll award them 2 stars."
Jay M.,"Mokena, IL",0,20,41,5.0,3/7/2017,"Had a great lunch here today. Many dishes in which to choose, although a bit pricey. One knock if there is one is that most of the seating is small tables which is a bit of a hassle having to move items around to try and fit on the small surface. For the most part the servers that I have had have been pretty attentive and have provided good service. They have all kinds of cheesecake with just about everything you could imagine in it, but the original cheesecake is out of this world, just a thought, more isn't always better....!"
Janet G.,"Crete, IL",0,3,,2.0,12/3/2016,"I had the Cajun chicken pasta for lunch,  which only is served as a full sized portion.  The portion looked like it was lunch sized.  I've had this dish at other locations and it was much larger.  I told the waitress and she insisted the cook staff made it the way it was supposed to be.  Note to chef,  or corporate... What happened to consistency across the chain?  I won't bother to go to the Orland park restaurant again... They're doing things their own way and it's  not what I've come to expect from  CF.  12/10/16: in response to the employee who answered my original post... We did ask to speak with a manager.  We were told they were busy preparing lunch.  If that's the best you can do,  we'll just stick to ordering cheesecake - - to go."
Malacus D.,"South Side, Chicago, IL",123,6,4,1.0,8/6/2017,"Came in last night to eat a quick banana cheesecake with my girlfriend and to say the least I was not impressed. The cheesecake was good, 7$ good though? I don't know, I feel like I could have made a better cheesecake at home with pretty decent ingredients for cheaper, but it wasn't bad. Anyway, our cheesecakes came out and BOTH of our plates had this weird grimy stuff on them, as if the plates were not clean all the way!? Yuck! On top of which I had some type of black crumble on my whipped cream (the waitress either lied or was completely oblivious and said it was from them cutting the fresh banana but lol I've cut many bananas in my day, I've never seen that sort of substance coming from a banana) I guessed it was crust from another cheesecake that somehow made its way to my plate, which is extremely tacky and not a good presentation at all. Well the waitress got me another plate but literally scrapped the cheesecake and the whipped cream onto another clean plate so I was left with a TERRIBLE presentation, just a big blob of mess on my plate, whip cream and banana all over the place on the plate, was the tackiest experience I think I've ever had at a restaurant in my life. I would like to add in though that the waitress was friendly but was very fast and made the experience kinda awkward because we were talking over each other. WILL NOT be coming back. No way."
Rachael M.,"Tinley Park, IL",56,1,,2.0,1/29/2017,Wait was ridiculous for mediocre food.  Very disappointed in the quality of the food.  Service was great but food not so much.  Use to be one of my favorites.
Mark M.,"Oak Lawn, IL",93,2,,1.0,11/26/2016,This place has turned into a dump since the last time I was here about a year ago. The bread was cold and the butter was mush. Our appetizer the avocado egg rolls were barely warm and the roll itself was paper thin. They messed up my dinner entree and had to wait 20 minutes for the original one I ordered. I was offered a salad while I waited that was it and to top it all off he said he was going to speak to the manager to take something off and that never happend. You're better off going oak brook.
Mary B.,"Oak Lawn, IL",30,113,75,4.0,6/25/2016,Came here for a date night recently. We were on a bit of a schedule as we wanted to make a movie at the theater. Our waiter was very attentive and we enjoyed our dinner experience with time to spare to make it to our movie time. I was surprised with the generous portion sizes.
Marcella F.,"South Side, Chicago, IL",0,6,,2.0,2/16/2017,"Hmmmmmm!!! Not really impress with the food or serve. I went for my birthday and I must say it wasn't the best experience. Had to take a table that we didn't want to seat at per the waitress they were low on staff so they had to close off several section, which was displeasing because literally I felt like the next party of people was on top of me not able to really enjoy table conversation. The food not the best salmon seem so dry. My Bellini was good and that's why I gave 2 stars"
Kelly M.,"Homer Glen, IL",0,2,1,2.0,2/15/2016,"So disappointing! I decided to treat myself at work for lunch one day so I ordered the cheese quesadillas for pick up. The menu reads: ""Grilled Flour Tortilla Filled with Melted Cheese, Green Onions and Chiles. Garnished with Guacamole, Salsa and Sour Cream with Chicken."" I've ordered it a bunch of times, but never to go. Yeah, the picture below is what I got. (NOTE: I didn't think to take a picture until after I had a bite, so just to clarify, the quesadillas did NOT come with a bite missing!) ...but they didn't come with much of anything really. My only specification was no chiles please. The girl at the desk even looked in the bag to confirm it was my order and then rang me up. For $10 they could've at least noticed there was no sour cream, lettuce, pico, guacamole - ANYTHING in there with the 4 lonely little quesadillas - they were so crunchy and borderline burnt! I normally love Cheesecake Factory, but it'll be a long time before I throw away money for nothing again."
Dave B.,"Orland Park, IL",16,1,,2.0,11/19/2016,Apps were good ...  Chicken & Biscuits were awful!  Bring back the old recipe ...  how dare you chsrge me $19 for chicken & frozen peas!!
Emelda M.,"Lansing, IL",90,2,,1.0,1/14/2017,"My nieces and I had dinner at the Orland Park location this evening ( January 14, 2017)..The last time I visted this location was June 12, 2014 which a birthday lunch for me.. Horrible!!!! I had the Fettucini Alfredo with chicken..The pasta under cooked.. I was so disappointed I never came back until today almost three years later!! Our waiter was pleasant not the best..My entree was the Herb Filet Salmon over mashed potatoes with lemon sauce and Asparagus..The asparagus was raw not grilled..So I sent the asparagus back ..Still came back under cooked..The food here sucks!! Over priced!! I love the Cheesecake Factory..Not this location I will never come here again!!"
Mae Z.,"Woodridge, IL",2,23,11,1.0,6/17/2017,Poorly made food and not a fan of the customer service at the Orland Park location..will NOT be returning!
Not I.,"Munster, IN",55,10,,1.0,6/29/2017,Waited almost 15 minutes for our drinks (iced tea). Now we've been waiting 40 minutes for burgers. I'm guessing they had to go out to the pasture for the beef. Hope they're spectacular.  Guessing management either isn't present or they lack the ability to run a functional store.
Sheri M.,"Chicago, IL",16,74,7,4.0,3/31/2016,"I haven't been here since around prom and recently, I've ventured here at least 3 times in 1 month. The wait is usually long if you come for dinner and a short wait for a weekday lunch. The food is ok. I had:  calamari - could've been better fried zucchini - great! buffalo blast -fantastic! mushroom burger - best I've ever had! shrimp scampi - shrimp were good, pasta was overcooked both times I ordered. Service was solid and punctual. I will definitely return for the buffalo blast and that mushroom burger - over and over again!"
Melissa M.,"Evergreen Park, IL",0,6,,1.0,7/9/2017,"Dined in on 7/9 at about 930p.  I have been to several Cheesecake Factory restaurants from Hawaii to California to all the locations in the Chicagoland area and have always been pleased until today.  First off,  waiter stole our table from another and then proceeded to tell us he was the better choice.  Wrong! We saw him maybe 2x.  Every element of our meal was served by another staff ranging from the manager to the bus person. Actually, the bus person was the nicest and most attentive.  The woman's bathroom was disgusting.  There was tissue all over the floors and urine all over the toilet. We never once got asked if we needed additional drinks.  Each and every person at the table including my 3&5 year old had glasses of ice and not one person offered to refill our drinks.  The part that took the cake was when my son ordered onion rings and found a shrimp in them.  He is deathly allergic to shrimp!!! The manager brought us another batch of onion rings, but obviously the onion rings are either prepared with the shrimp or in close proximity.  So another offer of onion rings was a slap in the face.  My experience was so awful we didn't even get to get cake which is why we came in the first place. The restaurant is dirty and the service is poor.  I will not be returning."
