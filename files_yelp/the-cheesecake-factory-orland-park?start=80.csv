Ryan G.,"Chicago, IL",4,7,2,3.0,2/11/2016,"It was a Saturday night and she wants to go to ORLAND MALL and eat at the CHEESECAKE FACTORY. 11 hour wait? Ok fine. Ok so really it was an hour wait which was expected - although given their location, a texting reservation system could be clutch here, so that the ridiculous mob of mindless hunger zombies outside the entrance could feel free to roam the entire mall, but who am I. On to the dining experience, our waitress was completely discontent with being there, and even less content waiting me for some reason. Outside of bragging that she was able to convince a cook to make a crabcake sandwich (I think that's something I took antibiotics for in high school?) I often worried that I needed to check her pulse to make sure she was alive. The food delivered, as always. Nothing to rave about, and entirely to expensive, but good nonetheless. The crown jewel here was a strawberry shortcake we rolled the dice on, that was delivered by a relief waitress while ours was on break (or perhaps she passed away?). Good ice cream, fresh strawberries and warm biscuits were a good dessert combination - but maybe that's because I'm a dessert rookie. Only suggestion is for them to install a defibrillator, if anything it could be used to awaken any zombie waitresses."
Rafat A.,"New Lenox, IL",2,7,1,5.0,10/7/2016,"Our favorite restaurant in Orland Park! The food is great, desert is the best, staff are fabulous & Floor Manager CHRIS is the MAN! Thank you for the great service! Keep up the good work!"
Emily R.,"Glen Ellyn, IL",283,264,260,4.0,7/6/2015,"I'm a fan of the cheesecake factory chain, so maybe that is why I'm not giving this place a bad review like some of the other yelpers. Personally, I find the food to be tasty and cheesecake to be great. I like how they offer a skinnylicious menu for days that I don't feel like eating over a 1,000 calories. I find the lemon-garlic shrimp to be tasty and light. I also like the turkey and avocado sandwich and the turkey burger. Although, the turkey burger is a little dry compared to the regular burger, when you want to eat healthy, sometimes that is what happens. Their strawberry daiquiris are very yummy and have an actual slush which I like considering some daiquiris I have had have been watery. The s'mores cheesecake is very delicious, but I always enjoy their cheesecake... :)"
Nydia G.,"Hammond, IN",0,1,,1.0,6/11/2017,"My mother and I went to this location for lunch a day ago. I have always wanted to take her here because I have had good experiences in the past. I also love their cheesecake. But I was so dissapoined on the experience. The service was the only great thing about it. Our waitress was super nice and understandable. But the food was so tasteless, cold and greasy. I feel so bad for even taking my mom here. Her first time experience was so bad, I don't think we will ever be returning here. I don't know what happened but the staff in the kitchen need to step it up and put some effort in what they are doing. Especially for the overpriced meals they serve. Our bill was almost $50 for lunch and a stomach ache shortly after."
Red M.,"Oak Lawn, IL",72,7,2,4.0,2/3/2017,"Hello peeps that are reading this. So I went to The Cheesecake Factory for the first time last month and I totally forgot to write my review. Okay so here it is. I like this place, honestly. Okay lets start with the staff. The staff is really friendly, the waitress we had, although I forgot her name, she was really nice and she knew exactly what she was doing. She had perfect timing, and she didn't do the 'I'm gonna rush you out' thing which is always a great thing to not have. Next we will talk about the wait time. So we went in during the busy hours of the business. So the wait was about 40 minutes, as this location is one of the popular restaurants in the area. So please don't be disappointed if there is a tiny wait for your visit. So now let's talk about the superstar of this place, the food. So I had the steak with mashed potatoes and green beans. The steak was perfectly seasoned to taste, and was really tender and it was a really great portion. The mashed potatoes are to die for. They were like the best mashed potatoes I ever had. The green beans were a nice green touch to the plate and were firm and cooked the way I like them. Now on to the Cheesecake, I had the Smores cheesecake and holy crap, it was like cake and icecream had a baby and it was cheesecake. It was super rich with flavor and I was sad when it was gone. Well here you have it my Cheesecake Factory review, Hope this helped"
Ricki J.,"Crete, IL",0,6,,4.0,4/29/2017,Pretty good always busy as usual. Bypassed the wait by sitting in the bar area. Felt like it took a while to be waited on but still a good experience
Angela P.,"Chicago, IL",0,16,1,2.0,2/25/2016,I went to the CF 2/25/16 for lunch. I had a meal from the skinny menu of Tuscan Chicken with a very small amount of vegetables. I had to order a side order of broccoli to complete the meal. For $15.95 I was definitely looking for a nice portion of veggies. I can not recommend it. The service was not good at all because it took like 20 minutes to get the food in an almost empty restaurant. The waitress was not good either.  Naturally the Key Lime cheesecake was yummy.  I will not go again.
Neomi A.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",47,12,6,1.0,8/11/2016,One of the worst cheekscake places I've ever been to!! It's like different from all the rest of them! So bad!
Shannon B.,"Orland Park, IL",0,14,,5.0,2/19/2017,"I had a fabulous experience at Cheesecake Factory in Orland park. The wait is expected. It's busy on the weekends, but the mall location is great to walk around in the interim. The wait is 1 hour average. Its worth the wait. Once seated a waitress greeted us immediately. She got our drink order and asked if we wanted an appetizer. Our bread was served warm with our drinks. I ordered the egg roll appetizer. It was perfect. My husband and I ordered Kobe Burger, and Chicken Picatta. Both cooked perfectly and were received immediately upon finishing our appetizer. My husband commented he wanted a burger, but received the Best Burger ever. For the restaurant being as busy as it was I was pleasantly surprised by how quickly the chefs created our orders so well. Finally we ordered Nutella hazelnut cheesecake and that of course was icing on the cake. Too good. The atmosphere is warm and inviting. Very clean environment and pleasant customer service. This place is very hectic. They are still super nice. Very great time. Highly recommend."
EMarie F.,"Lansing, IL",13,24,96,4.0,1/31/2015,"A friend of mine wanted to take me out to dinner for my birthday. I decided on The Cheesecake Factory in Orland Park, IL. After reading some of the reviews, I was somewhat hesitant. Some people expressed their disappointment in the quality of the food and the inattentiveness of the staff. I didn't want my special day ruined, but since I LOVE The Cheesecake Factory and their famous cheesecake, I decided to still go and see for myself. I have to say that my experience wasn't like that at all. The food and drinks were great. My server was Brad. He went above and beyond to make sure my experience was great.  My friend & I loved the bread! They brought us more when we asked. It was warm and the butter was also warm enough to spread on the bread. I hate  when the butter is served cold and it's hard to spread on the bread... But not at The Cheesecake Factory. It was just right. My friend even had enough bread to take home with her.  I ordered the Kobe burger. It was cooked to perfection. I only ate half (it was just that big) and I took the other half with me...along with a slice of red velvet cheesecake! Yum!  I went on a Friday night and it was extremely crowded but the staff appeared to have control of the constant flow of people. I gave it 4 stars because there is always room for improvement. I will definitely go back."
Mary D.,"Midlothian, IL",3,52,7,5.0,12/15/2015,"Twas the week before Christmas and all through the mall, Every restaurant was hoppin' so make sure that you call. The shoppers were lined with packages galore, birthdays and parties and there for much more. But i and my son walked in with a grin, And a pager and smile were given within. Soon at our table we sat with a smile  And dreams of cheesecake danced for a while. Our waitress was swift as she brought out our fare, And laughter and joking and joy filled the air. Our meal was delishious, much respect to the cook. But our time together, a mother and her son, some pasta and such, Is a moment we'll  remember and thinknof it much."
Steve W.,"River Forest, IL",0,27,,2.0,3/5/2017,Quality just isn't there. We've gave them many tries but unfortunately the place seems to get worse not better. Tables don't ever seem to be properly cleaned and dirty silverware.
K D.,"Oak Forest, IL",0,50,4,1.0,4/9/2017,My 2 year old daughter choked on a piece of plastic that was in her kids meal. The manager comped her kids meal. What a joke! I had to stick my finger down her throat and I pulled a piece of plastic out of her throat. What a nightmare!! Would never go back.. ever!!  The kitchen needs lessons in food safety.
Anthony M.,"Chicago, IL",3577,1312,9468,4.0,3/20/2013,"BALLS OF CHEESE I think this is what we should call this place.  We arrived at this location, after driving in a car from downtown Chicago for 1.5 hours on a Friday afternoon, in the pouring rain.  So we needed a drink and we hit the bar here.  There was already a long wait for tables.  In fact, I had to work my way around everyone who was blocking the front door.  My goal was to secure a bar table for 5 people and I was lucky enough to grab the last one. As we were deciding what to drink, I noticed that there was a Happy Hour food special.  Apps were available in the bar for only $5 on Monday through Friday from 4 to 6pm.  We decided to grab an order of the Cheese and Spinach Dip with chips and an order of the Mac and Cheese Balls. The Mac and Cheese Balls were out of this world.  Leave it to Americans to create a ball of mac and cheese, bread it and then drop it in a deep fryer. These totally reminded me of an Italian Rice Ball. The Mac and Cheese Balls were also sitting in a creamy vodka red sauce.  Everything just worked. I hate to admit it but this might be the best thing I have ever had to eat at the Cheesecake Factory. I am not a fan of the Cheesecake Factory. I believe that there menu is too big and that causes them to make lots of different  food but not lots of good food.  They seem to be trying to make every customer happy. So I was surprised at how yummy this deep fried balls of cheese were. Maybe there goal was to finally make me happy! We also ordered the Cheese and Spinach Dip with chips.  It was kind of weird because it also came with a mini dish of salsa and a mini dish of sour cream. I guess they were there in case you did not like the spinach dip. I found the spinach to be very fresh. It seemed as if this dish might have been made from scratch.  I also noticed that there were some artichoke hearts in here but there was no mention of artichoke hearts in the menu. Great job Cheesy Cake...what if I was allergic to artichokes?  This dish was good but not as good as those balls of cheese. We also got a round of beer.  The prices were a little high considering we were in the burbs drinking in a shopping mall.  My 312 beer on tap cost $8, which was way over priced but after sitting in the car that long in stop and go traffic I needed something refreshing on a Friday afternoon. Our service was good.  The waitress was attentive and brought us all of our items in a timely manner. I was really surprised at our food. I thought I would never eat at a Cheesecake Factory ever again. When we arrived at the Mall there were not many choices that included alcohol, so I kind of picked this place based on the fact that there were drinks here. Thanks Cheesecake Factory for stepping up and showing us a really nice evening.  And I will be back for your Deep Fried Cheese Balls. This is a bad addiction to have but boy is it delicious!"
Shari H.,"Chicago, IL",33,6,,5.0,4/5/2017,"Food was absolutely delicious. I ordered the Pasta Carbonara and a green salad. Loved the fact that the salad greens were chilled. The pasta, simply stated, was perfection--loaded with bacon bits and great creamy sauce. My friend ordered the chicken and biscuits which came with mashed potatoes and veggies. Her plate looked like comfort food heaven. Service was first-rate. Can hardly wait to get back to try more menu goodies."
Allison R.,"Bartlett, IL",1,11,6,1.0,8/29/2015,Not at all happy with this visit. My husband and I were celebrating our anniversary. Not that it really matters but was at least hoping for a nice dinner. I ordered sliders. I have posted a photo. The presentation was awful but I thought I'll just let it go. They were busy. But I opened my last burger as I always look at when I eat a burger and there was barely any meat on it. The waitress apologized and got the manager. The manager came over and said oh yes that is charred. I was like charred?? There is no meat on here. He's like can I get you another entree? Well no I'm full now. Well let me know if you want anything else. Um no? Still full. Then he says well of course I won't make you pay for this. Of course? Well it seemed to me you were just going to give me something new to eat. But ok.  So being our anniversary we decided to at least get some cheese cake. Well mine still had some of the  wrapping paper stuck to it. Come on? Also the person who brought our meals asked if we needed anything else. My husband said ketchup please. She said sure absolutely and never came back. So all in all a ruined anniversary dinner. Won't be going back here ever. Save your money. One good point. The outdoor patio is really nice.
Jackie S.,"Orland Park, IL",0,55,,2.0,7/6/2016,"Absolutely love cheesecake factories food! That's what makes me keep coming back... But there's many cons  I come the cheesecake a few times a year and each time I get seated in the most worst place possible. The tables are basically on top of each other. The first time I came here I thought I would be nice and stick it thru and I ended up having a miserable dinner having to listen to the table to my right and lefts conversation. Each time after that, if I get seated at one of the small booths I ask to wait longer so I can have another table (almost everytime the staff is not happy about it)  The service here is TERRIBLE!! I come here all the time and there's always something wrong. Our waiters almost never pay enough attention or somehow our order is wrong. There's been times I had to ask 3 different staff for something until I finally get it because my waiter never comes around.  The food here is so expensive! Only come here if you're looking to drop your paycheck. I plate of pasta is about $15. Really??  But... The food is sooooo good. This is why I keep coming back despite the horrible service. You can't find great food like this anywhere. If you're not looking for a terrible dine in try getting a to go order."
Liliana F.,"Chicago, IL",0,7,,3.0,3/20/2017,The food is good. I went last night the wait was terrible possibly an hour.  i got the truffle tower choclate cake and they gave me the tiniest piece of cake ever. Not worth the almost $10 it costs. Always check the cake.
Stacey F.,"Kankakee, IL",0,16,1,2.0,6/16/2016,"Yesterday was my mother's birthday so I decided to treat her to a birthday dinner anywhere of her choice. She chose The Cheesecake Factory in Orland. We arrived after a 45 minute drive and the restaurant was unusually empty. We were seated immediately and as soon as we learned who our waiter would be, I informed him that it was my mother's birthday. And he acknowledged my statement with a smile and wink (never telling my mom ""Happy Birthday."" As an appetizer, we ordered the spinach artichoke dip. The chips were nice and warm but the dip was cold and tasted awful. My mother and I ordered the Shrimp Scampi and my son had Pepperoni Pizza from the kid's menu. To say we were disappointed was an understatement. Our waiter seemed to be completely apathetic and disconnected from the experience. Our Scampi arrived and the shrimp was burned and the pasta was totally bland. No amount of salt and pepper could save that pasta. Again, our waiter couldn't care less. On a positive note, my son's pizza was really good and so were our strawberry lemonades. We each ordered a slice of cheesecake to go (that was sliced unusually thin to be $7), however it ended up being delicious. I've been to TCF several times where a birthday was being celebrated. They're usually given a slice of Original Cheesecake and ""Happy Birthday"" is written on the plate. My mom didn't get that. She got a bowl of whipped cream with a candle on top! Are you kidding me?  Not only that, the waiter brought out the bowl of whipped cream AFTER I paid our $100 bill. So I literally got a bowl of whipped cream with my receipt. My mother deserved so much better than this. On the ride home the conversation was about how awful the food was. Not at all how my mom's birthday should have been remembered.  I will not be back to this location and TCF is no longer on my list of favorite restaurants. I feel like I still owe my mother a birthday dinner.  ***update***I received a phone call from the manager who was very pleasant and genuinely seemed interested  in offering me a better experience on my next visit. I never planned to step foot in this location again but I am now excited to give them another try. Will update my review."
Kate H.,"Frankfort, IL",13,20,12,1.0,7/20/2015,"I keep trying this particular location because I do enjoy the food and it's close to home but the service here IS HORRIBLE!!!! I sat with a crying baby do 10 minutes, disrupting the rest of the patrons! Finally I asked if they still served bread, my son is hungry,...my answer? ""The bus-ers bring it"".  Yet another 5 minutes later who brings me bread? My waitress, no apologies. Guess who is happy and quiet now? Management should be shameful, I'm a manager and if I allowed this in my place of business, I'd fire myself! PS: I counted 8 staff members standing around watching this scene."
