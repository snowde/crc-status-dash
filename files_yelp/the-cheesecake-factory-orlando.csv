Maridyth N.,"Orlando, FL",93,140,514,4.0,1/6/2018,"We went here today with some friends for a late lunch, and arrived around 2pm. It was so busy that we had to wait an hour for a table (we were told this when we put our names in and opted to wait).  The waiting area in the restaurant can get a little tight, especially today with there being cooler than normal temps outside. An hour passed and we were notified that our table was ready. We went to the hostess stand and were directed to stand over in another area and wait to be called. I don't understand why Cheesecake Factory does this as standing room is at a premium at the front of the restaurant. After about 5 minutes of additional waiting, we were led to our table.  Our server was very friendly and welcoming. She took our drink orders then gave us time to look over the expansive menu. I ended up ordering the Americana Cheeseburger and a side of fries. This burger is topped with American and Cheddar cheese, potato crisps, lettuce, tomato, grilled onions, pickles and secret sauce. It was a very tasty burger! I ordered a slice of Hershey's Chocolate Bar cheesecake to go. This is Hershey's cheesecake between chocolate cake with chocolate frosting and chocolate chips. This is a rich, decadent slice of heaven...if you're a chocolate fan, you need this cake! Overall this is a good restaurant. The parking lot is large (it's in a mall), but can be a challenge; however there is valet parking if you want to skip the lot (and it's right in front of the restaurant!). The staff are friendly, and the food is good. It can be pricey, but the portion sizes are huge.  Check it out!"
Ritu D.,"Mississauga, Canada",23,107,245,4.0,1/1/2018,"We came on a cold rainy New Year's Day...just like everyone else in Orlando, it seems. We waited 2 hours for a table after being told it would be an 80 minute wait. We knew they didn't take reservations and this place is my older son's vacation meal destination....so we were prepared to wait. Luckily the mall was open so we were able to occupy our time. Once seated, the server was quite helpful in making food choices. I had the vegan Cobb salad which was huge, delicious and satisfying. Older son ordered a chicken sandwich and hubby and younger son ordered burgers....the mushroom and Mac and cheese burgers. None of them could finish their meals. They had shrimp tempura and bread to start. All 3 ordered cheesecake...salted caramel, marshmallow s'mores and banana cream. They took the cheesecakes back to eat later. Total bill was around $110 and all tummies were full and happy."
Dr. L.,"Orlando, FL",4,213,3,3.0,12/18/2017,"I usually stick to the basics here. My last visit I tried something different. The Put Beef Sandwich. It was the worst that I have every had at any restaurant , It was rubbery, chewy and really bad. I would not order it again if it were free. My server was nice but clueless. I should have sent it back but I did not have the time.  Do Not Order the Pit Beef..! Yikes... Be careful if it is busy which it often is. The hostess stand can be disorganized. Stay aware..."
Alicia B.,"Queens, NY",210,305,1324,4.0,12/8/2017,"My family and I (party of 5) arrived around 4:30pm on a Saturday afternoon. The restaurant was PACKED and so was the parking lot! The host told my cousin that there was a 50min wait. However, my cousin is currently takin chemo and has to eat before 7pm (reason why we got here so early for dinner!). My family told the host and asked if it was possible to get a table a bit faster .. either outside or inside because we knew our dinner would be fast.  The manager came over and gave us menus. He told us to look over the dishes so when we were seated we could order right away. We got a table in 15mins and ordered right away!!  The food was good and of course, the cheesecake .. absolutely delish. The manager came by several times to check up on us. It really was a great experience.  The compassion and friendliness of the staff was truly amazing. Highly recommended location (for off peak hours)!"
John M.,"Orlando, FL",188,36,83,4.0,11/27/2017,"Since my SO and I live about 2 minutes down the street, we probably come here about twice a month. We try and come a bit early since this restaurant is at the mall and can be VERY busy later at night. If you come when they're busy it can be about a 45 - 1 hour wait. I always order the same thing, ""Spicy Cashew Chicken"" because I love it. She changes between a few different items. We always start with ""brown bread"" with butter and their Balsamic Vinaigrette Dressing. This combination is nothing short of magical when you have fresh warm bread. If you don't want to pay for an app then this will fill you up just as much. On to the main event. The Spicy Cashew Chicken is most of the time prepared correctly, only a few rare times is it a little off. I only get the white rice, so can't say how the brown rice is. The sauce is amazing mixed the slightly fried chicken and the cashews. To me there's absolutely no spice, but it's too spicy for my SO. Another great thing is that it's large enough to have the next day! We always love coming to Cheesecake Factory for their good food. The atmosphere can be a bit loud and chaotic as this place is always busy. The cheesecakes are good too, just never enough room at the end to order them."
Jeffeory H.,"Miramar, FL",44,537,475,4.0,11/12/2017,"This institution of fine foods and cheesecake is not a place to miss. You don't find these on every corner so it can't be missed. As in the few times I've been here there has always been a wait, but it is worth it. After being seated we were greeted by our waiter who took our drink an appetizer order. Upon returning with the drinks he brought out some of that amazing bread they serve here. We chose to start with our favorite app the Avocado Egg-rolls. These delectable treats are amazing the crispy ness and flavors are sure to surprise.  I chose the Cajun Chicken ""Littles"" it comes complete with: Breaded Spiced Chicken Pieces fried crisp and served with Mashed Potatoes, and Corn Succotash. First let me say that there is nothing little about what you get. The chicken comes out piled high. The only thing I could wish for is a bigger stomach or their recipe. The food came out freshly made and tasted great. It is hard for me to pass up on the dessert so I always get the classic cheesecake to go along with my leftovers."
Ivan H.,"Miami, FL",91,240,1921,3.0,9/17/2017,"I'm a fan of Cheesecake and often go when we're undecided as a group. We recently went for a birthday and our group of 9 was seated within minutes.  This location looks exactly like their Dadeland Mall location in Miami.  I saw the fish and chips dish from their Aventura location and it looked really nice: large pieces of fish, not these scrawny pieces as I was served. Ordered green beans as I didn't want more fried foods but they came half way into my meals and so unexciting. Ok, green beans aren't exciting but these tasted so bad, undercooked frozen green beans.  Best part of the meal was the pumpkin cheesecake that was marvelous, an extra star for this, and another star for good service.  Other than that...my evening was uneventful.  Can't you guys do a better job? I didn't want to complain in a large group but I felt as if I was robbed tonight."
Tory P.,"Orlando, FL",217,116,250,4.0,8/9/2017,"Always. Busy. This location is honestly so smart. Located within/beside the Millenia Mall. This place must do so much business daily. This past visit I stopped in Sunday night around 7pm. Sunday night, you'd assume people were home getting ready for Monday/the work week, right? Wrong. Everyone is out. Assuming a lot of the customers to be tourists though. Wait was about 45 minutes for a table of two! That's crazy. Anyways, workers here always seem very flustered because it is always so busy. Really never had any issues though. Food is on par with other Cheesecake Factory locations I have visited. Nothing too spectacular though."
Angela R.,"FL, FL",63,129,304,2.0,8/28/2017,"I wish I could leave more stars. I love the Cheesecake Factory and have been going to other locations in FL and loved them all.. and then I came here.  Welcoming staff was nice, my fiancée and I had to wait a couple minutes to be seated and we were put in a pretty dark corner where the server had to ask a woman to move her purse, which seemed to make her very angry. Also, are non-service dogs allowed here? She had a small dog on the booth the entire time without a service vest? If I was allowed that I would've brought my dog too.... Our server came to us very quickly and gave us bread and butter immediately. He gave a time to look over the menu. We started with the loaded tot appetizer. I ordered the pineapple chicken and shrimp and my fiancée ordered the chicken and biscuits.  Our tots had a cream cheese plastic wrap inside one. The first one we tried. My fiancée took a big bite and pulled it out of his mouth!! I'm VERY glad we took that bite before any of the other ones.. hopefully the other ones they've been serving don't have them too unknowingly.... we brought this to the attention of our server and he told us it happened accidentally because the tots are all individually wrapped in plastic and they have to unwrap them each by hand .. but the plastic was INSIDE the tot.  Aside from that severe disappointment.. the entrees were ... okay. We waited what seemed like a very extensive time for the entrees to come out. My fiancées chicken and biscuits was fine. He asked for no mushrooms and they gladly did it for him. Only downside was the biscuits were cold! Waited near a half hour for cold biscuits.. :( I asked for my pineapple chicken and shrimp to have no cilantro ... and it definitely had cilantro still in it. And I can't stand the flavor of it. Aside from the bites with cilantro ... the entree itself was pretty satisfying.  Overall I was disappointed with my visit. It was an anniversary date for a year of being engaged and well.. I wish we went somewhere else. Unsure about how fresh everything is here (what's shipped and what's not, considering what the server told us about the plastic) but if they make them by hand.. I hope the cooks are more careful! Hopefully this location gets better. It's in a very popular area and I definitely expected more!"
Ashley B.,"Orlando, FL",191,200,1143,3.0,7/31/2017,I can only speak for the takeout experience. We came here on the half off price cheesecake day so it was a little chaotic.  We came here and they directed us to the takeout line. I don't understand why because we ordered for pickup. It was a little frustrating considering we had to be back at work fast. It took around 25-30 mins and we waited in line. It also felt like no AC was on and there was too many people. Finally a woman called our name and we got pass a few people and they rang us up for our phone order. The woman who rang us up was incredibly sweet and she made the experience better.  The cheesecake was delicous and I will be back to try other flavors. I wish I could've gave more stars but they could've created a better event with a more comfortable experience.
Hailey G.,"Kissimmee, FL",76,52,326,3.0,11/13/2017,"Trying to have dinner on a Saturday evening was just impossible!!!! My family and I tried to have dinner but the wait time was close to 2 hours. So we settled for just desserts at the to go order section, and decided to go elsewhere....I am so glad we did because By 2hours all hunger pangs would've turned me past the hangry stage. The to-go-order line went fairly quickly but there was a little wait for our actual order. Our cheesecakes were delicious but I was disappointed about not having dinner there...Anyhow, I will try to return maybe in the week for a sit down dinner."
Maria C.,"Clermont, FL",0,28,57,3.0,12/15/2017,"The waiting was roughly 45 minutes but once you get in there, they get right to the point! Therefore I would recommend it but remember it is the weekend so it will be crowded."
A. C.,"Orlando, FL",135,1162,8681,4.0,1/3/2018,"(12/15/2017)  We came in with a large office party (16) for lunch.  NOTE:  they do not take reservations, even for very large parties.  We made it a point to arrive before the lunch rush, which was good.  The staff were very efficient at getting orders, drinks and refills, and having our food come out timely and together.  Large parties seem not out of place here, so it was a good pick.  They didn't bat an eye when we asked for 16 separate checks, now that is some heroic service.  The menu is a literal book, one wonders if they can do it all well, and I think the answer is ""not really.""  Some things were very good (for a chain) and some things were really not good at all, like the Shrimp Summer Rolls.  I should've known better than to get Asian food at the Cheesecake Factory, probably low turnover.  The rolls were obviously made ahead, like yesterday, the skin was dried out and leathery, lettuce inside the wraps rather wilted.  Better to stick with things an American chain does best, like deep frying.  The Southern Fried Chicken Sliders were very good, probably the best thing I had that day, peppery, crispy, fried chicken cutlets on buttery brioche, with a spicy mayo and dill pickle slices.  Deep Fried Mac 'n' Cheese also a hit with the table.  Entrees are enormous (a professor of environmental health once said to me ""their proportions offend me""), def two meals for sure.  Prices pretty high, especially when you add it all up with drinks, apps, and the MUST have cheesecake (you are at the Cheesecake Factory)."
Matthew F.,"Orlando, FL",356,83,426,2.0,8/22/2017,"We had a party of 4 come on a Monday night. I had the shrimp angel hair pasta and also had some of the lettuce wraps. They food was okay - standard for a chain restaurant. However, the hazelnut cheesecake that we had was delicious.  The bummer was the service. My wife and I had water, while our friends had an Arnold Palmer and a sweet tea. While I admit we were there for a while, not once throughout our main course or dessert did our server refill or even offer to refill our beverages - all the cups were empty. Usually a server will, at the very least, offer to do it when they drop off the check, but this was not the case. We left extremely disappointed in the service and extremely thirsty."
Todd L.,"Orlando, FL",161,234,155,3.0,3/10/2017,"Well, I would've never chosen to come here, but I came for a birthday dinner.  And, well, I was pleasantly surprised.  Really, I would say it's 3.5 Stars. The service:  EXCELLENT!!!! Our server knew that menu inside and out, was patient, and was on top of everything, as were the foodrunners and support staff.  Good job. The food: I knew coming in that every dish is supposed to be like 5,000 calories. So, I went head first and ordered the meatloaf with mashed potatoes and gravy.  It was actually very good with a huge quantity. It might have been a bit overpriced, but it's expected at a tourist restaurant.  I tried others' appetizers that included guacamole, calamari, and an avocado egg roll.  All were very tasty.  Too full to eat anything else, I took two orders of cheesecake home. I haven't tried them yet, but I was surprised how small they were.   The value:  It's all a bit over-priced for what it is, but again it seems to cater to tourists and birthday parties, so I can't knock it for that.   Again, 3.5 Stars."
Mahmoud E.,"Orlando, FL",995,142,426,4.0,11/1/2017,"So I don't know why would anyone google Cheesecake Factory but to find their location because their reputation is superior , their food quality is recognized worldwide , it's a major food destination for every visitor to the USA . Our party tonight got several dishes and they were all amazingly tasty , prices are great and the service is world class ."
Gretchen M.,"Kissimmee, FL",76,64,27,4.0,11/1/2017,So after going a Friday night... at what I consider way too late to have dinner time... I must say I was surprised at how packed it was. Good thing the wait was not long at all.  The server was nice and patient since it was my first time and I did not know what to order.  I tried the crab bites and it was delicious.  I just hope they were bigger in size without being so big in price.  Also had a chicken quesadilla but that wasn't anything that blew me away.   Tried the chips and guac plus the pot stickers as well. I've had better pot stickers but they were ok. No room for dessert though. One downside is how extensive is the menu. No wonder why the kitchen was going crazy at such busy time. Let me tell you... after hearing the Happy Birthday song so many times it became annoying
Stacy F.,"Orlando, FL",1317,1460,7211,3.0,2/3/2017,"Obviously cheesecake is king here and shouldn't be missed if possible. The wait times and inconsistent staff here bring this specific location down a couple notches on the rankings.  There is forever a line at this one. That being said you'd think they'd have better waiting options. Plenty of places now offer a text when your table is ready instead of hanging in the lobby area. This place doesn't. To bolster that time suck they also have extremely limited seating to wait on.  The menu is the standard ""sweet jesus how can they possibly have so many options come from one kitchen??"" My go to is the parmesan chicken with mashed potatoes. I avoid looking at the black hole that is the menu here.  Cheesecake is an obvious win. The tuxedo is my personal fave and the black and white a close runner up.  Staff is inconsistent. We've had awesome waiters who didn't even let you sip out of your water without standing by to refill it and waiters who have gone amiss and you feel you should send a search party and file a missing persons report.  Overall: B- Be ready to wait. Obviously order cheesecake. Have search parties on speed dial."
Douglas D.,"Orlando, FL",182,81,326,5.0,8/2/2017,"Met up for a date night at Cheesecake Factory at the mall. This location always seems to be somewhat crazy since it is at the mall and it feels like there are people everywhere. We were seated fairly quickly and had our waiter Wagner check up on us when we sat down. He was very pleasant and explained the specials. The reason I love cheesecake is because they have so many different options on their menu and they give you generous portions. They have different types of food ranging from pasta, to Asian, to fried chicken, to small plates, and appetizers.  My favorite plate is the cashew chicken they offer. It is a very generous portion and has the perfect amount of spice. It comes with white rice and the sauce is sweet and spicy. Always my go to and ordered it tonight as well. We also ordered the avocado egg rolls and I'm a HUGE fan of the green sauce that comes with it. Never a let down. My gf ordered the pasta and she seems to always love it.  You can't leave without having a piece of cheesecake so I ordered the hazelnut crunch, which is fairly new, and my gf ordered ""old faithful"" which is the oreo cheesecake. The cheesecake is to die for and always a must have for me. Best dessert you can have after a delicious meal.    Cheesecake never seems to disappoint and always a favorite."
Yerim P.,"Orlando, FL",8,22,11,4.0,9/23/2017,It's been years since I've visited Cheesecake Factory. My fiancée and I stumbled into Cheesecake Factory by Millenia because our original plans at a different restaurant didn't pan out.  First of all there was a 40 minute wait when we got there on a Saturday night. Cant say we were surprised- it was a Saturday night and when we called earlier they informed us they do not take reservations during the weekend. Totally understandable the wait and line were insane!!  When it was finally our turn though -- the food was outstanding! We ordered sweet corn tamale because of a recommendation from a friend. I didn't know what to expect and I'm not a huge fan of tamales myself but man oh man - it blew my mind! The flavors mesh so well together and the sauce is sooo good. TBH this could be an entree all on its own if you want it costs around $10-11?  Next we got our entree - we both ordered from the specialty menu of the night. I got the pasta napolenta and he got the carne asada medallion. Both were really good. My pasta consisted of 3 different meats and the sauce was so flavorful. The portion wasn't as big as their other plates but it was more than enough for me! I even took some home.  We finished our night off with tiramisu Cheesecake - absolutely life changing. It was. AMAZING!!!
Melinda P.,"Orlando, FL",44,122,337,2.0,3/15/2017,A group of us came to Cheesecake Factory tonight for a friend's birthday. It was not what I would consider a positive experience.  They don't take reservations in the evening so our party requested a table at around 7 and were given an hour and a half wait. The buzzer went off in about that time and then we were told to stand in an awkward spot near the hostess station which is right in the way of people trying to run food. After standing there for about 5 minutes we were seated.  Our server was not particularly friendly or attentive. It took a long time to get all of our orders in. One order had a mistake in the side dishes and it took about 10 minutes for the correct side to come out. We ended up there until 10:00 by the time our checks were delivered.  On the positive side the food is quite good there. We shared some avocado egg rolls and loaded baked potato tots which were delicious. My order of chicken Bellagio was really good even though I took most of it to go. Everyone else seemed to enjoy their food as well. Unfortunately the extremely long wait times and lukewarm service do not make up for this fact.  On the bright side I was quite amused that the pillars inside look like the eye of Sauron haha.
Luke G.,"Umina Beach, Australia",8,19,27,4.0,12/2/2017,"As always, being a Friday night, there was a 20 minute wait to be seated (even at 830pm). Compared to the last Cheesecake Factory we visited, the service definitely was lacklustre, we had to request our bread a few times and it arrived pretty much as our dinner was arriving.  The Alfredo was a little underdone but still extremely tasty and the margarita pizza was pretty good!  As to be expected the cheesecakes were amazing, we took the original strawberry and the chocolate mousse cheesecake.  All in all, it is a great venue with great food!"
Debi W.,"Orlando, FL",10,164,303,4.0,11/1/2017,"We love this restaurant but the crowds can be constant at this location. Seating at the bar or in the bar area is first come, first served so it's great if you can nab a seat there. Full menu is available there as well. Portions are large enough to share making it easier on the budget. We love the Spicy Cashew Chicken."
MiquilinA G.,"Orlando, FL",7,52,45,4.0,7/22/2017,The service was great. We had to wait about 25 minutes for a party of 6 at about noon. But once we sat down we got our food very quickly. We ordered the lettuce wrap and which was large and I could have been done eating. It really was a lot of food. I tried the spicy chipotle pasta. I really liked it. I would order it again if I didn't get the Thai lettuce wraps.
Ha H.,"Columbia Falls, MT",0,14,77,4.0,11/6/2017,Sunday brunch should be one of the the busiest time! Very noisy and we had to be really patient for the food to be served. The food was good. Especially appetizer bread with butter was great!
Ahmed E.,"Windermere, FL",9,13,2,1.0,10/7/2017,Food was full of slat after one hour wait and they charge me for both items  Manger name jai and James came very rude and aggressive managers  This's the worst place in orlando and the worst customer Service because they feel they will make money and get busy anyway and the last thing is take care of Customers.  0 star don't go
Robert H.,"Winter Park, FL",12,20,1,1.0,12/18/2017,"After an afternoon of Christmas shopping, we decided to go to the Cheesecake Factory to get two pieces of cheesecake to take home. Walked in and they took our order right away. Then, we waited 20 minutes for them to put two pieces of cheesecake in a box and hand it to us. Sorry, but that's ridiculous that it takes you 20 minutes to take something out of the case in front of you and put it in a box. We were so annoyed that it killed the Christmas spirit that we've had all day shopping. That's the last time I waste my time at your store."
Mary W.,"Palm Bay, FL",31,175,653,4.0,10/19/2017,"Usually a line here, but at least you can go shopping at the mall while you wait. They have  a large variety of cheesecake flavors about $8 a slice. Their food is good too, served in large portions. You get a complimentary basket of bread with butter. Price is higher then average about $20ish a dish. Decor is romantic dim lighting. Very touristy mall with expensive stores."
Adrie D.,"Orlando, FL",58,135,333,1.0,7/6/2017,"I have to update my review because I couldn't even stay in here tonight.  We love the new items added on the menu, but from the time we got here the hostess with pink glasses didn't even great us, she was too busy chatting and then walked off leaving the host stand unattended without a simple ""Hello"" or ""Will be right with you"". They called us among other 2-top parties and of course they put our little paper with our info all the way to the end, while they keep on stacking other papers ahead of us making it impossible to get called to be seated. Finally our name was the only one left BUT of course, we get the worst possible table (next to the server station by the restrooms) which my husband barely fits in because he's 6'4 At this point we approached the hostess again and complained but what does she cares she's been laughing with other hostesses knowing you have people waiting on you. At that point we just walked out and took our business somewhere else... We're actually at BJ's now. Shame on management because you can tell the experience from my last review changed 180°.  My recommendation: you know you're  a busy location, train your staff (mostly the face of the restaurant) to be communicative and to prioritize their actions (e.g. leave the gossip for later and use that same energy to have a little courtesy towards your paying customers). Also learn to read your customers, if you're facing a very tall person don't put it down at the smallest table you've got knowing the knees will be rubbing against the table. How disappointing... I'm so sorry the kitchen is working so hard to keep up with an outstanding menu while the Front of the House screws everything up."
AL J.,"Staten Island, NY",43,81,112,1.0,12/9/2017,"A 3 plus hour wait, due to system crash and malfunction. It was pathetic, from the SEATING to the cooking was down for two hours. Not prepared for a system malfunction? What in the HELL? Write down, roll Orders, omfg, I would fire my managers... Conversation would go something like, ""You lost how much? For what reason exactly? What do I need you for again? You can't figure out that paper pencil and smartphones can work? The future is bleak! They get one star, due to Yelp not allowing less. So tired I couldn't be bothered for a discount................."
Butch D.,"Ticonderoga, NY",163,105,20,4.0,9/2/2017,"Got there at 7:30 and once we got to the greeting station we were told it was going to be 70 minutes for a table for 5.  We said no thank you and my wife had the brilliant idea of getting cheesecake to go and we would find some coffee somewhere to have with it!  Our intention was just dessert and coffee as my kids love their cheesecake and coffee.  So with an adjusted plan we achieved desired results.  We got a slice of the Godiva chocolate cheesecake (which is gluten free and my daughter and the rest of us LOVE it), we ordered the Carmel something or other which is always a fam favorite and then we ordered their Coffee Chocolate cream cheesecake.  Yes, 5 of us split 3 pieces because it is so rich and expensive.  3 pieces to go no tip was $26.  The cheesecake was excellent and we enjoyed it in spite of the 70 minute wait for a table!  Gotta love Plan B's!"
Cecille R.,"Apopka, FL",537,960,3424,4.0,3/10/2017,"I kind of avoid The Cheesecake Factory like the plague. Especially this location. It's always waaaaaay too crowded and it's tourist central.  I hadn't been here in years so when a friend wanted to have her birthday dinner here, I was happy to oblige.  While the crowded(and claustrophobic) lobby situation is a hot mess , CF exceeded my expectations with their food and service by the awesome Symone! First up, just note that this place doesn't take reservations for after 5pm. So expect a wait during prime dining times. Since we had a large party I made a point to place our name on the list about 1/2 hr prior to when we wanted to dine. Also, you'll have to kind of push your way up to the hostess booth or you'll be standing there waiting forever.  We had a few CF newbies and everyone seemed to be pleasantly surprised by their experience. Symone took wonderful care of us- she was fun, personable and on top of things. The menu is definitely overwhelming so I recommend browsing prior to dining especially if you've never been. There are soooo many choices and they even have a ""Skinnylicious"" menu for those watching their food intake as well as many meatless options scattered throughout the menu.  Aside from the complimentary bread, we ordered a bunch of apps to share amongst the table. The avocado egg rolls were delicious and a standout in my eyes. I ordered the guac and chips to share. Don't underestimate this- it was a substantial portion, fresh and you can pick your heat level! My friend accidentally bit into the pepper that it came with and confirmed the heat level for us! lol     Unfortunately, I ate too much guac b/c by the time my entrée came out, I was a little stuffed. My fish and chips looked great and it also comes with cole slaw. The fish was perfectly battered and a golden color. Tartar sauce is also provided for dipping but the fish was also great on its own.   A few of my friends ordered the sliders and those seemed to be a hit. And apparently you HAVE to get a side of ranch sauce for dipping. It was the star condiment of the night! Anyways a visit here can't go without a slice of cheesecake. We each ordered a slice (or 2) to go and also snuck in a surprise bday singalong for the birthday girl!  While this is not a quick dining experience, it was an enjoyable one! I'll make sure not to cross CF off the list so quickly for dining out!"
Jethro C.,"New York, NY",1,17,,3.0,12/8/2017,"The service at the Millenia location is really slow (even though everyone already knows that Cheescake is slow in general). You need to plan 3 hours for your visit (1 hr to get a table, 2 hours to finish your meal). The food and especially the cheesecakes are delicious though"

Mims M.,"Orlando, FL",54,151,72,5.0,8/11/2017,"Oh Cheesecake Factory, how do I love the? Let me count the ways. I'm sorry but this place never disappoints us. The lettuce wraps are always delicious and fresh tasting. My mom had the grilles fish tacos and loved them even tho the black beans didn't have much flavor. Wverything else made up for them. So good. Love this place."
Christina N.,"Orlando, FL",0,4,1,3.0,12/7/2017,"This was an alright visit. Best thing about this visit was our server, the drinks, and the bread. I had the four cheese pasta with chicken ($4 more of you want it with chicken) and there was barely any chicken in it. My friend had the California cheesesteak with fries which wasn't too bad only thing he didn't like was that the fries were over salted. Other than the food quality the hostess and servers were super friendly, will be back to try the cheesecake when we get the chance"
Carol C.,"Atlanta, GA",0,3,5,3.0,12/26/2017,"I called ahead of time asking if they were busy and I was told a 20-30 minute wait for a party of 5. Once I got there about 15 minutes later the wait was up to 45 minutes for 5. The table which we sat at had cheesecake all over the place. We asked for someone to clean it and our waitress handed us napkins. My utensil were dirty from the cheesecake. The small windows surrounding our table were covered with cheesecake, most likely a child did it, but it would be descent of them to clean it up. Bread was brought out but never replaced. Our server was good at refilling water though and the food came out at a good time, however everything came out at different times. I really enjoyed my Skinnylicious Shrimp Tacos, Im really glad they make a skinny menu since everything else is over 1,000 calories. I had the Tiramisu Cheesecake and it was very good. All together, waitress was good but meals should come out at the same time and cleaning should be more of a priority."
Krystal J.,"Estero, FL",9,12,8,3.0,10/9/2017,"Food from cheesecake factory is good everywhere I go. however it's the service I'm rating on. The waiter took long to bring us our bread and when we finished the first tray of bread, he didn't bother asking us if we would like some more. We had to ask for more when he came back. Food came fast but waited a while for our check."
Laura G.,"Winter Garden, FL",1103,355,1979,3.0,1/27/2017,I didn't love it. The menu is overwhelming with pages of options. The food was just o.k. ... my pasta dish was coated in oil and felt slippery ....the gluten free pasta option was incorrectly prepared and arrived at the table as pasta and milk. The waiter was good enough but made us wait forever for drink refills....the cheesecake was amazing.
Teresa J.,"Valdosta, GA",19,35,33,5.0,4/2/2017,"Omg.. just skip lunch and get several cheesecakes!!! So we did eat lunch. It was crazy busy with spring breakers, but the waitress was fast and food came out just fine. The bread and butter was delicious..wish I could find the butter!! Ordered lunch..but who cares about that.. We ate and then we went to pick out our cheesecakes to go.... Sooooo exciting. Every single one of them was aaamazing!!!!"
