Artur M.,"São Paulo, Brazil",8,4,6,4.0,7/2/2016,"It is located inside Mall at Millennia, the ambiance is a bit too dark but the waitress was very attentive. The chicken with mushrooms was very good, but I've tasted better cheesecakes before."
Liz G.,"Downtown, Orlando, FL",84,108,253,5.0,7/15/2014,"We've been to the same location a couple times and the food and service is always great. They recently put up a cover for those who sit outside, which is great during the times that a few rain drops fall but its not really raining."
Sanita M.,"Tampa, FL",125,383,2135,5.0,5/8/2012,"This is one of my favorite restaurants ever. The prices are good, the portions are soo huge (2 day dinner) and the cakes are amazingly delicious!!! I usually choose their amazing salads, one of my favorites is Santa Fe Chicken salad for $14.50 and I also love their meatloaf and Sheppard Pie. All chicken dishes, salmon dishes are very yummy. And their cakes... well, those are THE BEST IN THE WORLD! I have tried many of them, few of my favorites are: Ultimate Red Velvet Cake, Pumpkin Pecan Cheesecake, White Chocolate Caramel Macadamia Nut Cheesecake, Mango Key Lime Cheesecake. But I bet all cheesecakes are yummy.. and huge. Amazing with tea."
Noel G.,"Orlando, FL",13,83,195,5.0,7/23/2015,"You can never go wrong with Cheesecake Factory...my coworkers and I order from this particular location at least twice a month. I love ordering the ""Skinnylicious"" chicken tacos (no rice or beans on the side, just some veggies). Now, I am of Mexican heritage and know good tacos. C.F. uses corn tortillas that are heated up almost crispy with the marks on them. The ingredients are definitely fresh and delicious and the chicken pieces are good. The presentation, even for take-out, is worth the 5 stars. They don't use Styrofoam junk, but very nice plastic containers wit a clear top. And don't get me started on the desserts. Tried a black-out cake that almost made me black-out with glee...so chocolaty."
Saleem S.,"Kissimmee, FL",4,2,1,4.0,12/1/2015,I've worked at cheese cake factory for 1 year as one of the head chefs the food was cooked fresh and no it was not frozen u stupid jihadist
Fabio M.,"Orlando, FL",16,4,2,5.0,12/28/2015,Been going for the last 15 years!  It's always been great!  Excellent food and service!  Try the avocado rolls!
Madeline M.,"Orlando, FL",0,18,2,5.0,7/11/2015,"Hubby took me to Cheesecake Factory for my birthday! What a treat! It was packed full of people but after a short wait our table was ready. Our server was attentive and charming throughout the night. I had a passion fruit martini, with blood orange. Wow! So flavorful and fragrant and strong! Yum! Hubby had a piña colada and it was kind of blah... It was a virgin though.  For the appetizers we had the chicken wontons and the avocado egg rolls. Crispy succulent deliciousness. The sauce with the avocado egg rolls was sweet! That surprised me, and the fact that it went perfectly with the eggrolls.  My husband had the filet mingnon for his entree and it was beyond perfect. It was juicy even though he likes it well done. And sooooo tender!   I ordered the fish tacos. They were ok.. A bit bland but after a few sprinkles of salt they were good. They were tempura fried and on a corn tortilla. Also they would benefit from some hot sauce in my opinion, but there was none on the dish so I just left it.  But the STAR of the show was the cheesecake. My hubs got the s'mores one which was delicious, not overly sweet. You can taste every layer separately and the whipped cream and homemade marshmallow is top notch.  But mine.... Mine was... HEAVEN! White chocolate macadamia nut with a caramel drizzle. The name sends shivers down my spine. lol! Next time I will have dessert first. And if I have room maybe I will eat something else.  This thing was phenomenal. Not exaggerating. The crust is a blondie. There's whole macadamia nuts in it. The caramel is hardened and kind of crunchy. Heaven. Pure bliss. At least for me."
Richard F.,"Orlando, FL",16,59,77,4.0,7/3/2015,This restaurant was the one at Millennium Mall off of Conroy Rd. It was very busy but got a seat in twenty minutes. The server Samantha S. was very good without being pesky. Started with an avocado egg roll appetizer which was delicious. The main meal was good but not exceptional. Did get a tiramisu cheesecake to go. Yummy.
Cipriano M.,"Orlando, FL",193,680,4132,5.0,2/23/2014,"This place is amazing in terms of design, atmosphere, friendly staff members, and a large variety menu! This was my second time here in the past few years. The menu is so large that it will take you a very long time to decide on what you want. The downfall of a large menu is trying to decide on what you want in the end.  I think the prices are reasonable for the apps, entrees, and desserts. I had the pot stickers & Chicken Alfredo with Sun-dried tomatoes. The pot-stickers were great, however, there was not much of them. The entree was fabulous & such a large portion. The servers were very efficient, friendly, and kept up with my needs.  Of course you have to try one of their famous Cheesecakes before you go! Stop on by for an exquisite meal or Cheesecake with coffee."
Shellie D.,"Alexandria, VA",46,579,167,4.0,8/24/2012,"I really love the Cheesecake Factory. Their menu is massive with so much to choose from. The company values their customers and try to give you the best customer service. I came her with a coworker for dinner and we ate outside. I ordered the ribeye, which is not my favorite dish on the menu but I wanted to give it a try. One thing I have learned is not to order steak from anywhere besides a steak house, because my medium is never severed medium but rather  'medium well'.  My coworker ordered the grilled cheese and to my surprise it was very tasty. I really enjoy their Asian chicken dumplings, burgers, Louisiana chicken pasta, chicken marsala, chicken madeira and the calamari. Not to mention, they added new menu options too!"
Nicole B.,"Austin, TX",111,362,176,5.0,8/9/2012,"This is a great Cheesecake Factory. The service is always fast and friendly, and they're very accommodating with large parties. Of course it doesn't hurt that you can wander around the beautiful Mall at Millennia while you wait.  We had a truly great waiter named Mario about 2 years ago. He went above and beyond with utmost professionalism, courtesy and tact when he saw that a member of our group was visibly upset (regarding a situation that had nothing to do with the restaurant). We were all so impressed and touched by how he handled everything; we even made a call to his manager the next day to send our compliments. He was THAT good. I've been back several times since then on vacation and each time the CCF does not disappoint."
Joy J.,"Orlando, FL",12,334,2636,5.0,1/29/2012,"5 Stars goes for the Fried Sweet Corn Fritters!!!! OMG - I  have heard from others to try this appetizer and Last night was IT! I ordered this along with the Vietnamese Tacos and the Red Velvet Cheesecake. The Wait for us was about 90 minutes due to we wanted a ""Patio Seating"". We were there last night on a Friday night and it was pretty packed perhaps it was at the Millenia Mall and also a Friday. The service was okay due to we had to remind the server to refill the drinks.  Let me review the Food -- Fried Sweet Corn Fritters : I very much and also my palate enjoyed this appetizer. It was crunchy outside yet so soft and pillowy and somewhat creamy on the inside! Orgasm in the mouth! Its hard to really describe the pillowy taste of this goodness. The crunch of the sweet corn niblets added some touch to this food. The dipping sauce somewhat helped compliment the food it tasted of a honey mustardy sauce with a hint of spice. I took my time eating these (you get about 5 pcs per order) because i was just savoring the deliciousness of these fritters! Vietnamese Tacos - They used chinese soft white buns (similar to bao or siopao) that is split in the middle and stuffed it with bbq shredded asian pork and condiments of cilantro, bell peppers, onions and carrots. It is similar to a petite Bahn Mi but served taco style and the bread was more of a  fluffy bread and not toasted compared to a Bahn Mi. This was also tasty but so much reminded of eating asian bbq prk buns or siopao..There was a hint of spicey hot shredded vegetable that disturbed my palate for a few minutes. You get 3 small tacos for this appetizer. The presentation of this appetizer was colorful and great on the eyes. Red Velvet Cheesecake - This is my 2nd time on different occasions having this slice of dessert. I always go for it because the red velvet is actually GOOD!. The whole combination of the cheesecake, white chocolate shavings on top and red velvet cake is really music to my palate! It is somewhat rich so this time I didnt get to finish the whole slice. (to go pls?) Seating on the patio is I think a better experience than eating indoors due to the fact you get the view the array of people that shop at this mall and what shopping bags they have on their hands! LOLS Also it is not as loud as indoors IMO. The downfall to the patio is the heater lamps in which some complained it was too hot! Service could have been better with the drink service - However the food wait was not bad. Planning on coming here again for Brunch in a few weeks! Hopefully Patio service is better than last time we were here!"
Bill H.,"Suncook, NH",0,20,1,3.0,9/8/2014,"It was ok, it's a chain. If you ate at one before it's no big deal. A little Overpriced, just went there because daughter wanted to. Now it's done and we don't need to go back."
Troy T.,"Orlando, FL",0,2,2,5.0,9/3/2015,Great food. Outstanding service by April N! We will be back. We loved the orange chicken and the cheeseburger. The mac n cheese was to die for! Thank you April for being such a great server we will be back!
Jennifer C.,"Palm Coast, FL",0,20,,2.0,5/24/2016,"Uggh...every time we come to this place, we ask ourselves why did we come back. Food is not as good as it was in past years. Servers are not properly trained. Every time we get our appetizers, the entree follows a minute later.  I mean how can you enjoy the appetizer and have chance to digest it. They rush you every single time. So this time we rejected the entree as we needed to finish the appetizer. We decided not to get the entree as the food was no longer fresh or was covered up. So you know things have landed on the food I.e spit, dust and other things. They asked they will make new food. Really? How can we tell it was not just heated in microwave. Crazy! This place has gone down. It does not have the appeal but can be compared a regular diner.  Yes this place is comparable to a diner."
Diana K.,"Orlando, FL",1,27,193,2.0,7/9/2015,"My service was BAD. Soft drink FLAT and I tried several . Surprisingly my salmon was good. It took almost 20 min to come to me  had I known that I would have ordered the appetizer oh but wait I couldn't reach my server she was so not attentive. Oh so I thought she was having a bad day but now with the next guest that came and sat next to my table , she was all smiles  wrong one to have it with cheesecake factory get it together I know you have  over a lot of guests but train your servers!,  that each one of us is a valuable!! That is all."
Linnette G.,"Oviedo, FL",66,20,15,4.0,3/20/2016,"My first visit here was so so. The cheesecakes are always on point, but choose menu items carefully or you'll end up with something you need to send back. Large parties are NOT accommodated for. There are no reservations. You have to stand there with your 10 plus party and wait. Half of them must be present prior to them even letting you check in. So pray that members arrive on time, or give them an earlier time to meet if you want to be seated by a specific hour. For a restaurant of this size and magnitude, that's kind of daunting, especially with the amount of tables available. We had cranky, then sleepy kids after the long wait, then finally getting seated, then finally getting the mediocre food. Upon my second (and third) visits, it was a more pleasurable experience. Second time three of us just met for cheesecake and I got a pasta something. It was delicious. For my third visit, it was just myself and a friend since she wanted to try the cheesecakes. The food tasted great on this occasion as well. Ambience is always on point, and I love how they dim the lights as it rolls into evening. Very smooth transition. I also ordered a specialty, sugar free cheesecake here for a friend's dad once. I asked for it about a week in advance, just in case. It was presented beautifully on the day I picked it up (Thanksgiving) and it was a hit with my friend as their dad appreciated the gesture! As far as cheesecake goes, they know their stuff! Service is good, especially for smaller parties. The food may be hit or miss, depending on your selection, albeit some items are slightly overpriced. They have SUCH a huge selection of food, though, that most anyone will find something they love. As for cheesecake, pay whatever they charge you! You get a hefty slice and it is DELICIOUS. Their ""to-go"" for cheesecake can be hit or miss though. I asked for two plain cheesecakes with no whipped cream as my boys don't like it and they brought them both with whipped cream. Had to send them back and wait again."
maha a.,"Elmwood Park, IL",3,67,85,5.0,6/14/2015,"We're technically family to cheese cake at this point =).  of course we searched to find one during our vacation. Day#3 Our usual order is for family of 5  Thai chicken wrap(large portion very healthy and yummy!)  Buffalo blasts ((fried sigh stuffed with shredded chicken in Buffalo sauce) one of our favorites!  Chicken jambalaya pasta Fettuccine Alfredo sundried tomatoes Kids grilled chicken  Everything was great as always until I found out the fettuccine Alfredo has been changed on the menu,  I was surprised , they tried to recreate the dish for me which was nice,  but it wasn't the same, lol, like they've never made/cooked it before a million times! My son was in a playful mood and the waitress was nice enough to play along! Always good to be there!"
Michelle T.,"Baltimore, MD",2,39,3,5.0,5/27/2015,"My husband & I LOVE Cheesecake Factory in general but I'm writing this review for our server, Kelly, with the long dark hair. We went a couple weeks ago after dropping off a relative at the airport & we had such a pleasant experience! Kelly was such a friendly, happy server & was right on the money with everything. I even remember her name still weeks later. I've been in this industry for most of my life & I always like to give credit where it is due. Kelly, please stay humble & happy because so many other servers look miserable (not at this restaurant, just speaking generally) & they can learn a thing or two from you! :-)"
Stephan T.,"Hamburg, Germany",1,182,58,3.0,11/12/2013,"Not the best Cheesecake Factory we visit. Every time its very full and loud at this place. We have luck to get a table after 5 min. , ok we were there at 8 pm, but the place was full of hungry people. Service at the table was fast, but not very nice. He was just cool, but this not what I want as service. Food was not hot . He didnt ask about our liking of the food. After that all, we got our check incl. a notice for tourists about the gratuity. Helllooooo, I´m a grone man of 48  years, I know by my self how much I will give as gratuity. So over all it was not the best Cheescake Factory."
