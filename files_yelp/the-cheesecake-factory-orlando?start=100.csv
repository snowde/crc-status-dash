Tracey F.,"Orlando, FL",169,179,577,2.0,4/19/2016,"This was s pretty disappointing experience. We had a baby and a child with us and the beauty of this restaurant is the speed of the kitchen. Except that was not the case. It took forever got our order to be taken and the food took a bit. Our kids meal was brought out first, which we didn't ask for and prefer our children to eat with us. She was done  and ready to leave by the time our entree arrived . Except that my entree did not arrive, he rang in the wrong one so I had to wait. He offered a bowl of soup, which was nice, and the tortilla soup was good. But I d rather had my entree. The entree came, spicy cashew chicken, it was not good. The sauce was not good. Reduced too much. The cheesecake was good as always."
Alexandria T.,"Winter Haven, FL",201,15,171,2.0,5/25/2015,"Besides the difficulty of giving any establishment negative feedback with a low star rating, the most fatiguing task I have in front of me as I write this review is simply WHERE DO I BEGIN.  Let me do my very best at making an attempt to start somewhere, though I have so many things to say.  First off, upon going to The Cheesecake Factory at Millenia, I knew (thought I knew) what I was getting myself into. Its a chain, it is overly crowded, and the food is simply ok. The sad truth is that this establishment has been slowly declining over the years, and I remember as a teenager going here and having great meals (like their kobe burger). I regret to inform you, but those days are long gone my friends. My significant other and myself arrived starving. What we wanted was simple, and we weren't expecting gourmet: A chicken salad and a southwestern omelet. Two things that I frequently eat and can easily make for myself at home. So, it should be expected that any decent chef should be able to make these items with his or her hands tied behind their back. Right...  We placed our order; we waited. While we did so, I requested a laté. What I received was a water glass that was filled to the brim with coffee and foamed milk (oh yes I included a photo!). At first I thought it was iced, given the presentation and the fact that there was a straw included in the glass. Upon touching the drink I was shocked. It was laughable honestly. I have never seen anything like that before in my life. Quality folks! Quality over quantity. Its pretty hard to mess up something so simple, but that being said, they couldn't even properly cook our omelet. Its funny how the more I write about my experience, the more sense everything begins to make and the more I realize how truly horrible the meal was.  The omelet was overcooked and rubbery. Kind of like one of those yellow gloves you use to clean the kitchen. Enough about the omelet. On the pear and endive salad, I asked for the dressing to be placed on the side. What I got was a pile of drenched butter lettuce that looked downright sickly. It lacked color and the pear on the salad looked far from ""fresh"".  Sad. Two stars for the unfortunate food and the long wait accompanied by slow service. At least our waitress was kind! She was understanding and accommodating.  So I will now pose a question for you to meditate on as you contemplate your next meal with The Cheesecake Factory at Millenia. Why not skip the long wait and go to Denny's?  Cheers!"
Mícheál M.,"Orlando, FL",175,58,1194,2.0,5/26/2015,"Having been a longtime patron of The Cheesecake Factory I have a seemingly good idea of what to expect. Yes, it is a chain. Yes, it is busy. This particular location; however, has a number of problems. Being located at the Mall of Millenia felt like an advantage. I mean, it is a phenomenal spot. As a result, this location is packed to the brim with tourists. The hostess area is simply not large enough. I lost count of the number of times I was elbowed. So much so it became a conversation piece. The hostess staff definitely seemed in over their heads. Just abrupt, insincere and lacking care. Felt like I was doing them a disservice by being there. Just a poor experience.  After waiting longer than estimated, we were finally seated. Our waitress seemed sloppy and anxious to slip away. Inattentive and long waits between checking in. Case in point. My significant other ordered a traditional latte. What she received was a large water glass full of a poor interpretation. Disappointment mounted having to wait to address the big gulp coffee mess. The food was the last straw. I ordered a simple omelet. What I received was an overcooked slab of plastic. My significant other ordered a salad requesting the dressing on the side. Of course, she received a bowl of lettuce drenched in dressing. Ultimately, we were too fatigued to wait for replacements.  Bottomline: Recommend leaving this Cheesecake Factory for the tourists. For locals, there are far better options."
Hope P.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",1495,745,9030,5.0,5/27/2014,"Nothing I don't like from Cheesecake Factory. Hungry after strolling the Millennia Mall.  The wait time for lunch was 15 minutes, it seemed to go by faster. Got a nice booth seat and with my brother in law and fiancé, my man and myself. We ordered the flatbread to start. I was good just really small and thin, so for 4 people I suggest to get another appetizer too. I got the mushroom burger. It's really delicious they use  lots of Sauteed Mushrooms, Onions and Mayo, covered with Melted Swiss and Fontina Cheese. I subbed fries for steamed broccoli it came out perfect. My burger was medium-rare. My man got the Smokehouse Burger. Smoked Bacon and melted cheddar with crispy Onion Rings and B.B.Q. Ranch Sauce. He subbed fries for the sweet potato fries. Everything came out perfect and juicy great tasting combo. His brother ordered the Chilli Relleno Burger. It's  Charbroiled and Topped with Housemade Chile Relleno on a toasted Brioche Bun with marinated Onions, Chipotle Mayo, Cilantro, Lettuce and Tomato. It came with fries.he loved his burger. He waiter gave us a cheesecake not he house for having to wait when there were table open and the hostess wasn't seating anyone. Was impressed here. I will always check out Cheesecake Factory there's something for everyone."
Michelle J.,"Washington, DC",10,199,142,3.0,9/20/2015,"I took my mentee for her first trip to the Cheesecake Factory. The service was a little slow. My mentee enjoyed her meal and her first slice of banana cream cheesecake. I had the grilled fish tacos. The flavor and the sauce with the tacos was really good and the portion was huge. The entree came with black beans and cilantro rice. The cilantro rice was sooooo crunchy. They must have given me the rice at the bottom of a dried out pot. That was the downside. Also, I had to wait a long time to close out the bill and for a few other things. The Cheesecake Factory is always busy so waiting may just be normal. It's a fun spot with a huge selection of food. If you are in a rush  this may not be your first choice because there are no reservations and there is almost always wait."
Euro B.,"Orlando, FL",0,24,,3.0,2/13/2017,I feel this restaurant has deteriorated quality wise over the past couple of years. My fried Mac and cheese is almost always borderline burnt..I asked a friend she said same thing. The Cajun jumbalaya pasta size has gone down. Food seems like it was rushed to be prepared...I think they get so busy that they just don't care anymore if they lose customers. If you go don't expect out of this world food-its a hit or miss. Wait time is usually insane..call ahead to to check wait times..
Anna-Marie W.,"Orlando, FL",213,301,800,3.0,8/25/2014,"THE KITCHEN FORGETS TO PREP MENU ITEMS Recently Chad and I took a trip to the mall and I was determined to wait for a table.  I was ready.  I was prepared to sit by the fountain just outside the restaurant doors and be patient.  Turns out we waited only 2 minutes before being seated.  The benefits of traveling in a pack of only two. The tables are very tight.  We were placed in a two top along a wall of banquet tables, practically sitting on top of the table next to us.  It was fine, I was just happy to not have to wait the normal 45 minutes. We were immediately greeted by our server and we placed our order right away.  I am on the hunt for the best veggie burger in Orlando so that was an obvious choice for us, and we also ordered the lunch salmon with mashed potatoes and asparagus. Our server brought us bread right way as well.  About three minutes after placing our order, we were informed that the kitchen had not prepped the veggie burgers for the day.  In looking through the rest of the menu, there are not a lot of choices for someone who doesn't eat a lot of meat.  There is no vegetable plate, there is no veggie sandwich.  The offerings were limited to a few salads and a couple of pasta dishes in which we could omit the meat.  I rarely order salads out anymore as I can fix a giant bowl of lettuce in my kitchen at home along with the toppings of my own choosing.  I think most Veggie Heads are tired of salads being our only options when dining out. I was devastated they ""forgot"" to prep the veggie burgers. The Salmon Lunch Plate was very good.  There are three styles of salmon to choose from- herb crusted, miso and plain grilled.  We tried the herb crusted salmon and it was some of the best salmon I have ever had.  The herbs weren't overpowering and complimented the fish very well.  The dish was served with a small scooping of mashed potatoes and three spears of asparagus.  It was a lunch sized plate, a decent portion for myself.  For someone like Chad who has a little bit of a bigger appetite I would recommend ordering the dinner salmon instead. We didn't bother with getting cheesecake.  I was bummed and wanted to leave. Our service was excellent but it is definitely not a place to sneak in for a quick lunch.  Plan your visit for a leisurely meal and make sure you don't get your heart set on any one thing on the menu like I did.  We will probably not return- I don't want to wait for a table only to find out they are out of the few things I can have. I really had my heart set on that veggie burger. 3 Sprouts- I would love to give 5 here but the kitchen just can't ""forget"" to make something on the menu. Especially to your veggie friends. Boo."
Michelle D.,"Kissimmee, FL",77,8,11,3.0,7/14/2016,"Always so crowded and food is only ""so so"" ! Not bad, not good. Go early or don't go at all.  One day they asked us to wait for like 1 and a half hour so we decided to go to the BRIO restaurant just in front of the Cheesecake Factory. Best choice ever, don't hesitate to try BRIO, they have way better salads and constantly changing menu."
Ethan T.,"Orlando, FL",36,232,1074,3.0,5/1/2015,"This was a good experience. Excellent food. Very good gluten-free options. Clean and very busy restaurant. Their service is okay, A bit delayed and the waitress did not ask us how our food was.  Just noticeably slow service and the fundamentals of excellent service were overlooked."
George L.,"Kissimmee, FL",0,29,,2.0,9/30/2016,Went the other day with my wife and my daughter  my daughter been dying to go back to this place so we went the other day  we had a great time the server treated us very very nice manager even came over to talk to us about the brunch once we left we left so stuffed that we left out of there dizzy and we are actually wind up getting sick later that evening? Won't be going back there for a Very long time
Anna K.,"Selbyville, DE",0,2,,1.0,3/22/2017,"Today at march22 my friends and I had such a terrible experience at Cheesecake Factory at Millennia Mall. Our server Diamond was the worst server I ever had. She wasn't nice and friendly at all, and on top of that said some comments about my ""such a strong accent"" when I was trying order Cappuccino (not a hard word right? Even with my Strong Accent). She didn't ask us how was the food or wish us a good day or refill a drink. Like nothing what usually all the servers do. Literally she would just bring us deserts without any word and leave. My friend ask her to bring olive oil for a salad and she never get it. We felt very unwelcome there. She would just stay and talk to other tables and just totally ignore us. I hope the management of millennia Cheesecake Factory will take care of it."
Theresa O.,"Clermont, FL",0,3,3,2.0,1/15/2017,"Went for dinner for my father's birthday,I must say , food was good, as for our waitress Diamond, horrrrible!!!!!!     Attitude stinks, no hello,no smiles, no thank you at the end of dinner! Seemed like something got her mad and didn't want to be there and we got stuck with her. She took forever to get us anything we asked for, like she didn't care, definitely not trying to work for a tip. Handed us our bill at the the end of dinner and just walked away. Didn't say happy birthday, have a good night, thank you! Just put a damper on our dinner cause we couldn't believe this girl. Her name is Diamond, if you get her run! Worst waitress ever!!!!"
Jason C.,"Windermere, FL",55,66,15,1.0,11/3/2016,First time back in 2 years.  Wife and I had apps lunch. Food has gotten worse.  Let's help them.
Mandy C.,"Orlando, FL",170,115,255,3.0,9/6/2016,"Went out to dinner and dined with Fabiola who served us. The service that we received was less than subpar. Not only was she inattentive but she actually had the nerve of giving us an attitude when I mentioned that I wasn't too fond of my original entrée. Having a dry sarcastic server is very unpleasant, which set the tone for the rest of my experience. it was very disappointing to spend what was supposed to have been a special meal with my boyfriend in such a way. I'm hoping this was just a rare occurrence because I normally enjoy dining at other Cheesecake Factory's. Can't say I'll come back to this specific location though."
Sandra M.,"Orlando, FL",103,15,,4.0,11/12/2016,Came in for my anniversary and waited 10 minutes to sit outside. Our server andrew was great and the food was amazing! Recommend everyone to try to the godiva cheesecake! Awesome experience wish they couldve done something special for our anniversa
Heather W.,"Orlando, FL",361,207,163,4.0,8/15/2016,My fiance and I can't be around a Cheesecake Factory without grabbing a slice of Cheesecake from them and this is our favorite location. The staff at the counter is quick and efficient but they don't skip on the presentation. I have tried a few different slices but none are as good as the Cheesecake with Strawberries which is absolutely delicious. Each slice is a bit pricey but when I eat it I always feel like it is worth it!
Shadow S.,"Kissimmee, FL",1,10,32,5.0,7/10/2016,Our waitress Cristin and our waiter Theo were awesome they knew the menu and were extremely professional. We had the best time celebrating my best friends birthday. We will definitely be back.
Brian H.,"Orlando, FL",68,292,67,4.0,2/17/2016,"Not too shabby. This is really a 3 star review but the bartenders made it 4.  We have tried to ""walk in"" at this place multiple times without success. This place is consistently packed no matter what time of the day. We ventured last night around 9pm and even on a Tuesday night @ 9pm there was a 20 min wait. We opted for the bar and received pretty good service. The bartenders were attentive and the food was full of flavor. For an appetizer we had ordered the Chicken and Mushroom Lettuce wraps. The only gripe i had this  visit was the lettuce. One ""wrap"" was 3 mid pieces of lettuce cut into pieces. Just a lazy ass expo guy or cook. The bartender came back out with some more lettuce to make up for it. For dinner was the Steak Madiera and Shrimp Scampi. Damn is that shrimp good! Instead of mashed potatoes i ordered the veggie medly of Snow peas, and carrots. The side looked so depressing in the little bowl in which it came. 2 spoon fulls at the most.  I almost asked to send it back but i was hungry. I left still alittle hungry which is extremely rare at a Cheesecake factory"
Alina A.,"Orlando, FL",109,164,376,3.0,1/26/2015,"Great restaurants chain! Food and drink menu is very diverse, tasty, and of course THE CHEESECAKE!  However I give this location 3 stars only because it's an absolute nightmare to get a table here. Lunch or dinner! I suggest get here between 4-6pm for dinner and 11am for lunch. Otherwise you will easily be waiting an hour or more to be seated. No joke."
Sara W.,"Brewer, ME",2,54,22,3.0,11/7/2016,Food was ok.  Very crowded and our waitress had many tables.  The cheese cake was yummy.
