Adam S.,"Port Orange, FL",0,11,,1.0,6/21/2017,"I have eaten at a lot of cheesecake factories over my lifetime and by far this was the worst experience I have ever had the food was subpar at best and the appetizers took at least 30 minutes to come out. The only good thing was the Adams Cheesecake, I would stay away from this location!!"
Louis B.,"Orlando, FL",10,99,48,4.0,5/5/2015,A very solid restaurant and definitely would recommend going.  It's priced extremely fair for what it is and the menu of main dishes all tend to be amazing.  I have had an assortment of dishes here and have never been disappointed.  The desserts here though are the cherry on the top of an already great dining experience.  The waiter staff has always been helpful and friendly. My only complaint is the wait. Especially at peak hours.  I understand that this just the nature of the business when you are this popular and good but it does get annoying to wait for a hour for a table.  Good news it that they text you when the table is ready and you have a mall to browse while you wait. Highly recommended.     PS The Cheesecake is the only desert worth trying there.  The cakes and anything that is not a cheesecake tends to be disappointing.
Pablo U.,"Orlando, FL",63,1,,2.0,12/5/2016,Went to take my girlfriend here for her 21st. We had nice experiences the past two times. Definitely a huge drawn out wait for the food to come out. Unfortunately our last visit included finding hair in our food....definitely won't be coming here again
Stephanie T.,"Richmond, Canada",85,152,2788,4.0,4/23/2014,"I love Cheesecake Factory. I wish we had some in Canada. If it's where I am on vacation, I will always try to go. The only issue is that there was a long wait time for a table, as with any other Cheesecake Factory I've been to. At 7pm, the wait was 1 hour 20 min. As we were super hungry, we instead waited around the bar area for a table. These are first come first serve and we spotted a few tables almost leaving. We ended up grabbing one in 30 mins, which is a much more reasonable wait time than 1 hr 20 min. The waiter we got was very friendly, but since it was so busy there he had a lot of other tables to go to so at times we had to seek him or ask another waiter for him. It's always hard to order from the Cheescake Factory. Tons of variety and I want to eat everything. Factory nachos: huge plate of nachos with lots of stuff on top. The cheese seemed to be the cheez-whiz kind instead of shredded cheddar, though. Lots of toppings, generously layered, 6 people could share as an appetizer. Firecracker salmon: a must whenever we go. Super crispy, tasty salmon, very delicious. Underneath there is a bed of cabbage in a delicious sauce. The salmon is to be dipped in the brown sauce that is quite salty but tastes sooo good, especially when covering the cabbage ""salad"". We got the one on the regular menu because it comes with more pieces, whereas the one on the Skinnylicious menu has less and is not as worth it. Skinnylicious menu, lemon-garlic shrimp with pasta: The light menu is a great addition to the already humongous menu. There was really a light sauce with the pasta, and a few giant pieces of shrimp. It's supposed to be 550 calories and it really tastes like it. Perfect for those who don't want something heavy to eat. Skinnylicious menu, ahi tartare: it's chunks of raw tuna on top of avocado and in some dressing, with four chips around it. Pretty good, small portion, quite tasty. We always get this one too. Asian inspired! Chicken Bellagio: This could be shared between 3 people. It's a creamy pesto pasta with proscuitto on top and two giant fried chicken steaks. I don't have a picture of this but it was amazing. Quite a heavy dish and I don't think one person can finish it. Perfect for sharing and a good value! Key lime Cheesecake: this came with two huge dollops of fresh whipped cream. It's a little much for us so we just push it aside. The key lime cheesecake was quite sour and very hard, as if it was just frozen and still defrosting. I still ate it of course, but I personally would have ordered any other cake on the menu! Too sour! Overall, it was great. I love eating here and would go again. Not too keen on the long waits (reservations not allowed after 5pm). They even ran out of buzzers because so many people were waiting. Also, they seem to be a little understaffed although they should know how busy it gets every single night! Either way, love it here and would recommend 100%!"
Matthew P.,"Santa Rosa Beach, FL",0,4,,2.0,5/5/2017,"45 minute wait, even at 9:30pm.  My meal was good, however my wife's and daughter Philly cheesesteak the bread was SO HARD, both could only eat a few bites as it hurt to eat.  The server who started out pretty good but was so inattentive after taking our orders and not good with followup. Told the server about their meals and just said I will try to tell my manager.  Was really looking forward to this dining experience but walked away with a below average experience."
Haruka K.,"Orlando, FL",1,40,118,3.0,5/22/2015,"I have been here before and it was great, but today wasn't one of them.   We ordered the avocado egg rolls, potato tots, bang bang chicken and shrimp, and some chicken dish I forgot the name of it.   Our server didn't check on us during our meal and we kept looking around hoping she was close by to grab her attention.  I think in the future I'll just stop by there for their cheesecakes."
Elisa R.,"Orlando, FL",240,140,172,4.0,1/1/2016,"This is a very popular restaurant. It's located in Millenia Mall so it's constantly busy with foot traffic. We got their today, on New Year's Day at 2pm as their was an hour wait. Once we got seated our waitress was great. Very kind and quick with everything. I got the miso salmon lunch special and it was absolutely delicious! I definitely recommend this dish for all. We also got a lemon merengue cheesecake. It was very tasty as well. Good portions, prices, and food, just except a long wait on certain days due to the area it is in."
Eric T.,"Casselberry, Orlando, FL",60,39,34,5.0,10/17/2016,I love Cheesecake Factory. The greeter was nice. It was only me so they sat me at a very small table. My waitress was nice and attentive . I ordered chicken samosas with miso salmon and salad. The samosas came out first. They were hot and delicious. My waitress came several times to fill my water glass without me asking. The salmon looked awesome. That wait was no to bad. Thanks cheesecake this was a good experience.
Jim B.,"Vaughan, Canada",44,653,411,5.0,2/24/2015,"By far the busiest Cheesecake Factory I've ever been to. Arrived on a Tuesday night at 8:15pm and it was packed....the wait time was around 20 minutes, which is exactly what we waited to be seated. Our server, Paul, was fantastic. He was efficient and friendly. I ordered the Orange Chicken with brown rice. It was fantastic. My dining companion ordered the Spicy Cashew Chicken with brown rice....it too was great. Didn't have room for a piece of cheesecake (key lime) but got a slice to go. Can't wait to dig into it. As with every Cheesecake Factory I've been to, food is great, service is good and you never leave hungry. Love it ! Dinner as described above, 2 pops and a slice to go...$50.34."
Brendalisse P.,"Orlando, FL",4,14,13,4.0,4/4/2017,"4/3/17 I liked eating here a lot the portion of food was a lot and so was the drinks the menu is big so theres lots to choose from. Its not too expensive either, but it was crowed and you first walk in no one is there to greet you you have to kinda guess where the line is or if they are just standing there or even if there is a line to stand in. So that was a hassle finally i read a sign on a chair waiting area that said approach the front desk. I didn't feel acknowledged they were so busy. Eventually he asked me how many in my party (2) asked if i wanted inside or outside (inside) he said ten min. 10 min later same guy goes to seat us and he's taking me outside, i told him i asked for inside and told us it was going to be 10 more min. I was willing to wait that actually despite how hungry we were because it was so hot outside. Well the waitress was nice i could not help but notice the piece of food hanging from her lip though, im like 99.9% sure she was eating something back there. We asked her what she recommended she said everything that wasn't t too helpful. But id like to go again and possibly try their burgers and brunch menu items."
Alex R.,"Greensboro, NC",249,359,155,3.0,11/7/2014,"This. Place. Was. Packed.  I assume that is typical.  With that being said, if it is typical, their check-in and sit down process was HORRIBLE!  They took your name and phone number and sent you a text message when your table was ready.  We went in to the front and were pushed into a group of about 25 people that also got a text.  This mob of hungry folks were right in the middle of the walkway.  So people entering and leaving the place had to pass through us as we spun around to dodge all the people and littered them with apologies.  It was madness.   Once we sat down it was a relief.  The food was okay.  I ordered a pasta dish with chicken.  The chicken was a little dry and there was little to no sauce.  I waited for our server to come back around to ask him for more sauce but he was gone for too long.  Maybe the mob got him?! We really were waiting for the cheesecakes so we ordered 4 of them...for the 2 of us.  Shut up, we took two home for later. We tried the Reese's Cup, Oreo, Carrot Cake, and fudge.  They were all excellent.   Food: 2.5 Atmosphere: 2.5 Cleanliness: 4 Service: 2.5 Value: 3 Total: 2.9"
Mrs D.,"Charlotte, NC",2,14,18,4.0,3/4/2016,"Always a good experience coming to this place and esp with kids at least the servers are pretty approachable.  Start with some fried calamari and awesome skinnylicious Asian chicken salad for appetizer, some pasta da Vinci with that and tiramisu for dessert to die for."
Jennifer E.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,8,4,5.0,9/2/2016,"I love this restaurant chain and specifically this location. They always provide excellent customer service and the food is always fresh. I went there last Friday and had a meal with my family and the server was friendly, recommended several items to those who had not been there before, and always made sure we had everything we needed. The food was hot and fresh, and everything was delicious. Keep up the good work!!"
Tiffany R.,"Windermere, FL",167,50,22,4.0,8/9/2016,"Great new menu. The only reason they aren't getting a 5 is because the really good new almond crusted salmon salad is kale overload :( everything else about was excellent and the sauce over the salmon was delectable, quinoa with cranberries and avocado are a great accompaniment and the almond crust was fresh over fried. Just ask for 1/2 the portion of the kale... Yuck.  The pear flatbread was delicious and also the lemon raspberry cheesecake... Just disappointed with the kale overload."
William M.,"Miami, FL",38,74,,5.0,11/26/2015,"One of the best Cheesecake Factory's I've been to, the food, the the waiting time, and the waitresses are excellent!  There was nothing wrong, amazing food."
Jen R.,"Philadelphia, PA",12,3,17,1.0,2/15/2016,"For the second time in a row I have received horrendous service. This evening my friend and I came in and sat at a high top. We are greeted by a familiar face(she's screwed up our food before) and she says ""you've been here before, right"" right you are! So, we order our food(burger with NO onions and chicken sliders. We then wait 45mins only to have the burger come out with onions all over it. We immediately send it back and the server says ""it will only be 3minutes."" manager,Sean, comes over and basically suggests we order something else because it's going to take too long to cook a burger. We told him what the server said to us about only 3 mins and he proceeds to correct us in saying, ""at least three minutes- it's only physics that you can't cook a burger in 3 mins"" that's right... Blame the customer for ordering food off your menu...you call that damage control?!  I will never be back to Cheesecake Factory. I don't even like the food. The only reason I went was to meet a friend on their break."
Jason D.,"Marlton, Evesham Township, NJ",240,167,299,3.0,8/30/2015,"The coffee was exceptional, but the Tex Mex egg rolls were subpar. Still a positive environment, but was a bit let down."
Melinda B.,"Saint Cloud, FL",264,243,930,2.0,8/12/2015,"So after consulting with another elite yelper for about half an hour on some new places to try in Orlando, my husband decided that he wanted cheesecake and we ended up at the Cheesecake Factory. Ryan F. Was not pleased with me! Lol. I should have listened to her. Ok first of all we waited for over an hour for a table, they have a huge menu and while some people may love that, I feel that it's a bit overwhelming. I never know what to choose. I decided to get a few appetizers instead of an entree. The egg roll sampler looked cool but OOPS! SALMON! I'm allergic to seafood. So I asked the waitress if they could switch the salmon egg rolls with any one of the others in the sampler.  She went to check and said No! What?! Why?! So they can take it off, charge me the same amount and not add the other egg rolls. So the server's response was. ""Sorry, I just work here"". I ordered the chicken pot stickers and Texas egg rolls, awesome flavor and good portions for appetizers. My husband ordered the steak tacos which he said were good. And my son had the grilled cheese sandwich which both my husband and I snacked on as well. We also ordered the passion fruit mojitos which were delicious. But I was still a little peeved so it was difficult to be happy. Until..... The cheesecake came! I ordered the new Salted Caramel and my husband ordered the Strawberry.  I don't know why they bother to serve anything else. The cheesecake was perfect, sweet, and creamy. I think this will be strictly a dessert place for us from now on. And I'll head into winter park to one of Ryan F's fancy places to eat instead!"
Kenny L.,"Orlando, FL",41,61,84,2.0,7/23/2015,"Ordered the crab hash off the brunch menu. When it finally arrived, it looked amazing, but looks can be deceiving. Poached eggs were extremely watery as if just dumped on the plate, the sauce was just a weak excuse for hollandaise sauce, it tasted completed bland and flat; potatoes were extremely undercooked. In fact, some of them were raw and inedible. To top it off our server had some kind of chronic ***** face the whole time she served us. The best part about this experience was the bread and it's probably because it was store bought."
Derrick B.,"Huntington Beach, CA",27,210,46,4.0,11/13/2015,"Always a fav spot while shopping at the mall at millennia. Good service, consistent food and decent prices."
