B B.,"Orlando, FL",0,11,15,5.0,9/14/2016,"Came in with an associate of mine, for happy hour, we sat ourselves, there was only one table available by the bar, only because other guests waiting, sat at the bar tables not eating nor drinking . Kelli was our server and gave great recommendations . We ended up ordering chicken samosas, potstickers(the best), fried mac n cheese, artichoke dip, southwest egg rolls, and a happy hour burger. Overall the food and drinks were good except for the shots of American honey costing $11.25 a piece, we had a good experience and got business done. I definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a chill place ."
Priya D.,"Marlboro Township, NJ",195,13,11,2.0,4/11/2016,"Came here after a trip to Disney with two of my friends. Was seated at the bar and bought food. My friend was tired and put her head down due to heat exhaustion and the manager very rudely strutted over to us about 30 seconds later and literally said ""I don't know if this is a sick thing or a drunk thing but you need to keep your head up."" There is a way to inform customers of proper behavior at a restaurant and this was not the way to do it. Thankfully our waiter was very understanding and brought extra waters for us. I am disgusted with the manager's reaction to my sick friend."
Berthina M.,"Gainesville, FL",81,77,26,5.0,7/31/2015,"Reviewing The Cheesecake factory is a little ehhhh....because everyone should know that this place is great!!!! With that being said....I will say ditto to all of the other great reviews and add my two cents... Happy Hour--- Not sure if you know but they have a happy hour and their apps are $5.50...WHATTTTTT for cheesecake factory that is a steal. They great thing about this is that they still give you the same portions...So its not like they give you a five dollar portion...now thats what I call value. Their drinks are also half off as well....If you can eat at cheesecake factory for less than $10...thats like the ""hitting the lottery"" Feeling.... TIP: If you are wearing dark pants and they give you a white cloth napkin...ask for a black cloth napkin....it help...no lint... :)  Favorite meals: Chicken Costeletta- Crispy chicken with a lemon sauce served with yummy mashed potatoes and asparagus....absolutely amazing and you will have enough to take home Buffalo blast - their version of boneless chicken wings...little pockets of buffalo sauce chicken served with great bleu cheese dressing.  Avocado rolls - little yummy crispy spring rolls with creamy avocado and the best little sauce to dip...."" I like sauces to dip...just saying"" Cobb salad---OMG...their balamic dressing is amazing....and this salad is huge...they chop everything very well and toss....nothing too special...normal ingredients but I love it.  Jamaican Black pepper shrimp...---WOW, shrimp in a spicy black pepper sauce...a little spicy; however, they give you this mango salsa which is refreshing along with relief from the spicyness...served with white rice and sweet plantains.... Enjoy folks...."
Doug G.,"Atlanta, GA",184,250,144,4.0,6/9/2014,"So, I usually try to stay away from reviewing chain restaurants, but what the hey!  We all know the food, the bountiful menu that takes 30 minutes to scroll through before ultimately giving up and changing your mind to the first dish you thought about when you first opened the menu! I never have an issue with the food here, ever. At all locations I have had the same consistent level of good food, but at this location the service received is something I was not accustomed to from a CF.  I will give creedance to the fact that this place is BUSY!! Not just busy, but B-U-S-Y most of the times for dinner. Im talking sometimes a 2 hour wait for a table on the weekend. So, advice here is get there early or have some shopping to do while you wait!  As mentioned above, food was great, but due to volume here the service is lacking."
Mary Ann M.,"Orlando, FL",13,6,5,4.0,12/6/2014,"We always come to this place because we love their huge menu so you can have a different plate every time you visit. My favorite plate is actually in the skinnylicious menu, tuscan chicken, it is delicious and healthy! I also love the lemon herb chicken, which is a half chicken topped with lemon sauce and two sides, a must try! All of their pastas are good and their desserts are out of this world. We usually get the fresh strawberry cheesecake with extra strawberries.  The only thing about this place is that it is usually crowded and have long wait times but if you have a patience it is totally worth the wait."
Andy J.,"Orlando, FL",87,359,2246,3.0,4/28/2013,"The food is usually very good here and the portions are large.  This presents a challenge since the real reason you come here is for the cheesecake.  Although they are pricey, the Mai Tai's here are the only ones I have liked outside of Hawaii. They loose a star because you typically have to wait 40 minutes to an hour to get a table here and they don't take reservations."
Carolyn O.,"The Villages, FL",0,35,10,4.0,12/19/2016,We had a birthday dinner for my husband on a Sunday evening close to Christmas. It was very busy. Our server was very accommodating and efficient. My husbands meatloaf was delicious and huge. My salmon was grilled perfectly. My daughters shepherds pie was really good. The weird part was the birthday surprise. It was a bowl of whipped cream with sprinkles... period. They were told about the birthday when we checked in. Very strange.
S W.,"Christiansburg, VA",0,99,47,5.0,12/27/2016,Out shopping with family while on vacation. Beautiful location at The Mall at Millenia. Efficient server. The food took a bit to arrive. I forgot what I had ordered. Our entrees were delicious and enjoyed a slice of cheesecake.
Cherise L.,"Winter Park, FL",6,5,,2.0,11/7/2015,Lunch service needs a major process rework. The wait was only 15 minutes but they buzzed 8 parties pagers all at once. Traffic jam at the hostess station. Huge restaurant and a line at the restroom like a concert. Backed out the door. Three stalls inside.  Sloooooooow service. I mean slow. Good good opportunity for all else.
Wesley P.,"Las Vegas, NV",7,31,78,5.0,9/13/2015,Excellent food. Great for breakfast on Sunday. If you come early you will have set seat quick. They open at 10am and you can try the California omelet is delicious !!!! And served good weath bread!!
Coris D.,"Madison, WI",30,7,7,3.0,5/19/2016,"We have been other Cheesecake Factory, love the Bloody Mary. But this location Bloody Mary tasted no alcohol. I had two and didn't feel anything."
Helida T.,"Orlando, FL",0,3,4,4.0,7/13/2016,"It is a nice place to drop off!!! The food is amazing, our waiter was awesome, she was giving a training to a new guy but both were so nice with us!!! Definally you have to eat cheese cake!! The only thing that I did like it was the waiting time!!! You have to be patient!! I will return"
Ashley C.,"Pittsburgh, PA",68,69,25,3.0,5/3/2015,"While I do enjoy the atmosphere at the Cheesecake Factory, I find that the food is average at best. This was my first time visiting this location at the Mall at Millenia. I went to celebrate my birthday on a Friday night. The main reason we chose to come here was because we had a $50 gift certificate.  In all, I found that the entire experience was mediocre at best. The wait staff were not very friendly, and no one even cared to see how our experience was going. On top of that, it appeared as though the waiters were overworked, and frequently saw them running around appearing stressed.  In all, it was a mistake to come to this location, especially on a Friday night. When I return to a Cheesecake Factory, it will most definitely be the one in Winter Park.  One cool thing, though. Rather than giving you a pager while you are waiting, they now simply enter your phone number. When it is a few minutes before your time to be seated, you will receive a text. This was nice as it allowed us to walk around in the mall while we waited, rather than sitting in the overcrowded lobby."
Trikki ..,"Los Angeles, CA",0,5,2,1.0,1/2/2016,"Told it will be an one hour wait for a table - not bad. After an hour and a half I enquired how much longer - "" a few more minutes we are running a little behind"". Buzzer went off after 2 hours and then I had to wait another 15minutrs while the ""hostess"" scrolled through her table screen looking for a free table. Management and front if house staff need a good shakeup. BE HONEST WITH WAIT TIMES!!!!!!! Food average at best. Waitstaff service impeccable"
Kelvin X.,"Orlando, FL",6,3,,1.0,7/5/2016,"Well. I ate here before. But this time makes me crazy. I waited for water almost 5 mins and the bread cost me 10 mins. Then I ordered the food. After almost 40 mins, I saw my pasta comes slowly. To go box and check cost other 10 mins."
M A W.,"Sumter, SC",32,50,134,5.0,7/26/2015,The Staff and the cheesecake were both OUTSTANDING. I wish I got the gentleman's name. Talk about gentleman! He went out of his way to open the door for me as I was leaving! That felt as good as the first bite of the red velvet cheese cake which was worth every penny/dollar I paid for it! Glad I don't live closer to a Cheesecake Factory...it is dangerous...in a good way!
Geoff Y.,"London, United Kingdom",147,349,86,4.0,3/4/2015,"No real reason to go here, other than that we were in the mall at the time and instead of heading back to the hotel to eat, we decided to eat first and then head back. It was a little chaotic in there, no real surprise as it was evening on the 23rd December and the mall was packed with last minute shoppers. They gave us a little buzzer thing and then told us to come back once the table was ready. About 15-20 minutes later it went off and we were taken to our table. A French Dip sandwich, Asian salad and a Grilled salmon were ordered, along with lemon tea, an unsweetened ice tea and... a Skinny Cosmopolitan. I asked my dad if he was sure he wanted it and he assured me that since it came off of the Skinny menu, it was alcohol free and that's all he wanted. I tried to reason with him but to no avail. The look on his face when it arrived and he tasted it was priceless! The food was surprisingly good, the French dip being the best I had had in a while and that's saying something.  We opted not to get desserts, choosing to have a quick meal and get out of there. It was a good quick meal and the place operated pretty slickly despite the massive load of people there. We saw multiple slices of cheesecake passing our table, but we've tried them before and to be honest, mine taste better!"
Remy A.,"Houston, TX",0,9,,1.0,11/30/2016,"I don't get the big deal people make about this place. Apart from the desserts, the have food is just average for the money paid. Yes presentation is nice, but what's the point if it ain't perfected by the taste! On a quiet Wednesday night there shouldn't be any excuse for food to come out cold and tasteless, service was okay, burgers disappointing, Barry any seasons on the meat (which had a good taste), fries taste okay but not fresh n hot (been sitting under the heater for a while), fish and chips mediocre, first bite from both ends is just batter with no fish, coleslaw and tartare sauce tasted good. Waited a while for food to come out after we sent the spinach dip back coz it did not taste right.  Service was okay, server got us bread but we had no side plates or silverware to eat the bread warm. Manager apologized and took the app off the bill... Well I didn't eat it, I wasn't expecting to pay for it anyway."
Andrew M.,"Orlando, FL",0,11,,4.0,12/24/2016,"Although it is always busy and expensive, the service and food is really good !"
Lauran M.,"Winter Park, FL",0,28,107,5.0,10/18/2015,"There is not one menu item that I can say that I did not enjoy. Food quality and taste is always consistent, service is always exceptional!"
