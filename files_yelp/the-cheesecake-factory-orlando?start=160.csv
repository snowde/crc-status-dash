Helen H.,"Duluth, GA",290,703,850,4.0,1/21/2014,Great!
Erwin M.,"Portsmouth, United Kingdom",52,53,133,4.0,6/21/2015,"This is one of my favorite restaurant chains, period. I do not give the full 5 stars rating simply because of the extremely long waiting time that I've experienced in the past at this location. Luckily, we got seated in less than 10 minutes during this visit. Food is great here, let's start with that. Anything you order will be delicious. Even the free bread is! You have a broad variety of drinks and cocktails to choose from, a great selection of appetizers and main dishes to order, and an incredible menu for desserts. Personally, I don't really like cheesecake (funny, right?), but they have other great desserts you can order that are not related to cheesecake in any way. Am I returning? Definitely! Hopefully sooner than later. However, they should at least crank up the range of their vibrating device for table-waiting. They should let you walk around the whole mall and still be within range. I am not joking, I've waited up to an hour for a table here before!"
Connie K.,"Miami, FL",68,100,20,4.0,7/6/2015,"I went this weekend with my parents on fourth of july - what's more american than some good old burgers and cheesecake?  The wait is always long at this location, around 30 minutes.  We went to the bar area to scout a table, beware! this is like a shark zone, who ever can grab the table first wins - even if you annoy the people who are still eating!  Service was good, waitress was waiting a lot of tables so we understand that the food might come out slower than usual.  We were given our bread basket promptly, and we shared 3 entrees (Fish tacos, mac and cheese burger, and fish and chips) between four of us, and a red velvet cheesecake at the end.  Everything was delicious!"
Ashley J.,"Orlando, FL",8,3,8,1.0,6/22/2016,"I had a group of 15 and tried to make reservations before coming. The waitress told us that we couldn't make reservations but we could come in and get a buzzer. So when it finally buzzed we were told that we had to have at least 13 present in order to be seated because only 10 of us were there at the time. So we waited and 3 of our girls showed up late so then we were seated. The meal was so expensive and not really that amazing. $17.50 for mashed potatoes, flat chicken, and two small biscuits. I wanted to try a cheesecake so I ordered and pointed to the one I wanted to make sure the waitress could understand since there was so much going on around us. Still, I received the wrong cheesecake after the longest wait. I ate it and paid for it anyways because I wanted to go home. My cheesecake was over $7 and it tasted average. All in all, that was my first and last time at The Cheesecake Factory!"
Danny M.,"Altamonte Springs, FL",11,25,3,2.0,4/22/2016,"Service is terrible , food was ok at best had past Da Vincci with chicken and double jack and Coke took 20 mins get my drink"
Kristin K.,"Lakeland, FL",0,11,,3.0,3/3/2015,"Good: the food is amazing, never had anything bad there. The waiters are on point and served my party of 10 with a smile all night. Recommend the 30th anniversary cheesecake! Bad: the hostess were incredibly rude throughout all interactions. They asked us to call for a aheads up, and when we did they were mad. I brought it up and they got snapy. They were impatient with other customers and demeaning to people as they came in."
Sara J.,"Miami, FL",0,5,,5.0,5/4/2016,"Love the atmosphere. Food is Delicious. My favorites are Crab cakes, Orange Chicken and Chocolate cake is to die for!"
Ana M.,"Kent, WA",139,99,42,4.0,4/5/2015,"Love their food at any location, I just hate that this one is always so packed. Although it's always busy, my service is always out standing. I love the red velvet cheese cake!"
Francisco M.,"Orlando, FL",45,993,1664,4.0,12/8/2013,"We decided to eat here after finding out it would take 2 hours to see Santa. We waited approximately 40 minutes to be seated, the mall was a madhouse. We began with the Pot Stickers and they were perfectly cooked and had great flavor. The soy sauce was flavorful and it wasn't overpowering. Our entrees were served on monstrous plates as always. I went with the Chicken Marsala over a large bed of Bow Tie Pasta. The chicken was juicy but the amount of pasta served was way too much. It was enough to feed 2 or maybe even 3 people. I was forced to leave a lot of it because pasta fills me up quick. The wife had Steak Diane & Madeira Chicken Combo. The portion of food was a bit more reasonable and she was able to finish with the help of my 4 year old son who for the most part only eats steak.  We chose the Hershey Cheesecake with Smores which was silky smooth. It comes with crumbled graham cracker and two mountains of whipped cream. We decided to share because of how full we were. Service was top notch, our server checked in on us constantly despite the restaurant being completely full. This location has a lot of servers and I believe that's the reason for the attentive service."
Chad K.,"Savannah, GA",55,1,1,2.0,8/16/2015,"So I went to grab some food after shopping at the mall with my mom. I was told a 15min wait, we got a table in 20mins. Not too shabby. Ordered a calamari appetizer and it was delicious. The passion fruit Mojito was amazing as well, I need to make these at home. The entrées were meh at best. I ordered the Bang Bang Chicken & Shrimp and the server said it was more sweet then spicy,  I almost changed my order because I wanted it spicy but said she likes it spicy as well and has the cooks add more chili pepper flakes to it to bring up the heat. I asked her to have them prepare it that way as I wanted it spicy. My mom ordered the Garlic Noodles without chicken or shrimp. Food came out and my ""spicy"" Bang Bang Chicken & Shrimp was anything but spicy...as in no heat whatsoever. Not to mention the small amount of chicken and shrimp in the dish, especially for a $18 dollar entrée. My moms Garlic Noodles were super bland with almost no garlic flavor to them. She had to have the server come back and load it up with parmesan cheese just to get any flavor on the dish.  We were pretty disappointed to say the least, especially for the price of the food. We don't mind spending the money, if the food warrants it but this meal did not. Sucks because we have fond memories of getting amazing food at location down South at the Sawgrass Mills mall. We should have made the 20min trip down to Cafe Tu Tu Tango instead."
Lindsey W.,"Orlando, FL",2,45,,4.0,5/31/2016,Wonderful time appetizers and dinner were very delicious the  waitress was very nice and polite took care us great can't wait to go back.
Tiffany L.,"Miami, FL",414,138,314,5.0,11/23/2013,"So I've been going to Cheesecake Factory for many many years now - for lots of different occasions. I do enjoy the food and I've always had decent service but I'm reviewing this one specifically because the service was spectacular tonight.  Our server's name was Pepe! No, he's not Mexican lol. And he has a cool tattoo on his right arm! He was very attentive, but not annoying, and he took very good care of my boyfriend's little brother, who is severely allergic to milk. Most restaurants and servers don't go far to make sure that he has a good time or try to see what other options, but he went above and beyond for him. So if you ever go to this one, ask for Pepe!  What I love about their menu is that it has so much variety. My favorite is the Crispy Chicken Costaletta - the lemon sauce is so yummy! It has 3 fried chicken patties and it comes with mashed potatoes & asparagus. I order this dish like 9 out of 10 times! Crazy, I know.  I'll give this place a 4.5. I was so amazed with the service. Definitely expect a wait though. It is at the Mall of Millenia and there's always tourists there!"
Jackie C.,"Kissimmee, FL",18,36,37,2.0,1/16/2015,"I love their food but the whole seating process was just terrible. We waited 30 minutes for a table and never got called, so we said we would sit outside in the ""heated"" patio... That was still cold, they told us it would be immediate seating but it wasn't. We waited after party after party after party got seated before us. It was terrible"
Chris D.,"Winter Springs, FL",0,32,2,3.0,5/8/2016,Desserts for Mother's Day today. Walked into an open table in the bar area. Desserts and coffee were great....except for the mouthful of grounds I got on the last sip. Ugh. Would've been four stars otherwise.
Mrs P.,"Orlando, FL",0,16,6,1.0,1/6/2016,"This location has the worst customer service! Many of my family members, friends, and myself do not go to this location. They are rude. Can never get an order right and have bad service. I've given them four tries in the past 2 years and it's never been right. Save your money and your time. Go to brio :-)"
Stephanie V.,"York, ME",41,326,132,5.0,2/3/2016,"I do not have one of these restaurants remotely close to my home. My son suggested we go here. They make an awesome margarita and their food is fantastic. Apparently, one of their popular appetizer items, which was phenomenal, is going away. Their Au Jus is unbelievable. I can't say enough. Staff was really nice and everything we had was really, really good. I just wish we had one close to my home!"
Kat T.,"Orlando, FL",23,45,91,3.0,11/19/2015,"It's 9:00 pm and still 30 mins for the wait. Half of the Disney world is here. Similar amount of scrollers here, blocking every entrance and exit. Kids running wild like watching lord of flies horror movie.  I'm sure it is their family vocation. But come on, controlling your kids in public is not a foreign concept."
Retesha T.,"Orlando, FL",4,14,13,2.0,3/30/2016,Every single time I walk in this restaurant it reeks of dirty mop water. It literally made me sick the last time I was there. I always have to request to sit outside and sometimes outside seating isn't even open to the public
Don R P.,"Winter Garden, FL",266,93,133,2.0,2/26/2016,"Good selection for sure. Little slow in service. So dark, you can't even read everything in the 20 page menu. Food was little warm and you can tell been seating warmer."
Rosie P.,"Orlando, FL",38,123,168,5.0,7/14/2013,"Came here for my best friends birthday dinner. Ryan was our waiter and he was absolutely amazing... definitely one of the best waiters I have ever had before (you should ask for him if you go). Not only was he very good at what he does (taking orders, getting drinks, making sure that everyone is taken care of at the table) he was also very personable. We talked to him a little bit in his down time, and he made us laugh a few time. Everyone at my table loved him, and said the same thing... that he is on of the best waiters we have ever had (Props to Ryan) =) My friend is gluten free so we had to bring a cake in. They had no problem keeping it in the fridge till we were done eating. The food was amazing. I ordered the Herb Crusted Salmon and it was delicious. My only complaint is that the asparagus was not cooked as much as I like it to be. Which is no biggie, because I did not specify, and I know a lot of people prefer their asparagus a little on the crunchy side, I like my cooked. So next time, I will specify.  All in all.. Fabulous."
