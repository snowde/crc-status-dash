Mat B.,"Auburndale, FL",7,21,6,4.0,9/24/2015,"I love cheesecake factory. Their Avocado Eggrolls are my favorite appetizer and the Crabcake sandwich is what I order everytime. The funny thing is the desserts are not as great as you would think, they are good, but Ive never once had a dessert from there and thought ""Wow this is amazing!"" With that said, I will always eat here because the menu is awesome. Their Cuban sadwich is great as well."
Cori G.,"Orlando, FL",0,60,,5.0,4/10/2016,Great variety of food. Wonderful cocktails. Perfect for date night. Went last night and had the passion fruit mojito. It was sooooo great. Red velvet cheesecake is to die for. Really great service!:)
Jerry N.,"Orlando, FL",3,25,32,3.0,2/23/2015,We live down the street from Cheesecake Factory so we come here about once a month. Today thank god the wait for a table was not bad. we had some bad experiences waiting for a table. But today was nice. Service was ok. Food was same as always ok. Didn't understand why our firecracker salmon appetizer took so long today. But the Miso salmon is something you can never go wrong with
MzVirtue R.,"Orlando, FL",2,72,80,3.0,8/10/2016,"Chosen by guest for business lunch back in May. Honestly, the cheese cake is probably the most memorable thing here now and I did not have it this day. Slow service and food was just ok. Unless I am going for cheese cake, will bypass next time."
Michelle S.,"Orlando, FL",131,80,1,4.0,9/8/2015,portions are huge i always have food for lunch the next day. Servers are always friendly and food is always great. Im a desert person so i always take one to go here.
Li E.,"Lake Mary, FL",98,33,12,1.0,10/26/2014,"Ordered a cake to go on Sunday afternoon, it looks like a returned item from someone 's table..."
Sivan N.,"Toronto, Canada",83,34,6,5.0,1/1/2016,"Super busy, try to get a spot near the bar bc it's first come first served; you see a table open it's yours. Vs if you write your name down it could be a 90 min wait. Great food and service! Love the avocado egg rolls and the apple cheesecake."
Vanessa P.,"South Gate, CA",0,9,2,1.0,1/29/2016,"If I was able to give 0 stars I would. Ordered a pasta and a Cuban sandwich. The pasta was drenched in salt, and the Cuban sandwich had pork in it, or so I thought until I opened the sandwich and saw chunks of fat. It was extremely disgusting. Do not come. Don't waste your time or money."
Desiree R.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",0,9,2,1.0,8/11/2016,"I wish I could give them zero stars. I know it is an extremely busy spot, but these people need to get it together! We went two weeks ago and we were seated, took forever to take our orders because apparently there was about to be a shift change. Young man took our orders, my 4 year old niece asked for a vanilla milkshake, I ordered a chicken pasta something or other. Milkshake gets to the table first and my niece spits it out immediately. My mother decides to take a sip because she sees something floating around. THERE WAS ALUMINUM FOIL IN THE DAMN MILKSHAKE!!!!! Really now? Aluminum foil?!? My niece could have choked! Everything else after that just went down hill. Manager came to apologize and say it must have fallen in the blender! Diners beware!"
Margie L.,"Liberty, MO",0,5,,1.0,2/25/2017,I visited this location this past weekend for my daughter's birthday. Sadly this was the worst experience I've had by far in any of the Cheesecake factory locations I dined in. The night started with a receipt telling us to come back in an hour to get a pager. When we returned in an hour for the pager the front desk indicated to us we had no wait and we should've got a pager right away. We were seated after an hour and 45 minutes. We were first greeted by one server who apparently was having a very bad night then later by a different server. Finally we had a third person bringing us items. The food was incorrectly placed therefore delaying half of our meals coming later. The server did not apologize but rather give us attitude about the change which clearly was her fault. We asked for a manager he came over to apologize but there was no sincerity and the apology was clearly scripted. Finally after asking four times the servers gathered to sing happy birthday to my daughter. I received no discount for the inconvenience rather I received a bill that was double the amount and I had  to ask them to change it.  Change in management and servers is needed immediately.
Albert P.,"Lake Mary, FL",70,470,113,4.0,6/21/2015,Great food and drinks. This location is very crowded since is located at the entrance of the mall. Once you area seated the service is on time!
Saul S.,"Davenport, FL",11,50,39,4.0,11/12/2014,"We all know the food, the menu that takes 30 minutes to scroll through before ultimately giving up and changing your mind to the first dish you thought about when you first opened the menu! I never have an issue with the food here. I always get the cob salad. It never disappoints Me.  As mentioned above, food was great, but due to volume here the service is lacking. It's always busy here. But, the food is good."
Toni D.,"Orlando, FL",607,534,615,5.0,7/2/2014,"Lunch at Cheesecake factory is actually a pretty good deal. You get almost dinner size portions for half the price.  My mom and I stopped here before out shopping outing at IKEA.  We both ordered the fish and chips for around $11.95 for lunch. I substituted the cole slaw for a Caesar salad for $1 more.  The portions were huge.  Four pieces of fish opposed to five that comes with the dinner.  Overall, as usual I really enjoyed my meal."
Sean G.,"Dublin, Republic of Ireland",31,509,538,4.0,9/17/2014,For your safety share everything. Portions huge but food v good and save room for sll those cheesecake s. We have eatenin Lad Vegas andhere several times and love it
Jay G.,"Winter Park, FL",3,38,30,3.0,8/29/2015,"The food is good but I find it to be inconsistent.  We were here for lunch and needless to say it was not bad, but the place had an unusual odor?? Like dirty mop water. Anyways, its ok, the cheesecake is usually consistent enough and worth going for"
J T.,"Orlando, FL",2,46,8,4.0,5/15/2015,"One of my all time favorites. Although intimidating at first, their extensive menu will satisfy anyone's craving. What I like is that the food is always consistently good no matter if I am in Atlanta or Orlando. I just hate that the wait is usually very long here. Doesn't seem to matter the day, if you come in the evening, expect to wait at least an hr. I'd shoot for lunch for less wait times. The chicken madeira and chicken marsala are among my fave dishes paired with my fave wine - the Chateau St. Michelle Riesling. My fave cheesecake has evolved from the Dulce de Leche to the Red Velvet. Who doesn't love red velvet?! Just remember, you can easily spend $60+ on dinner for 2 if you opt to add alcohol & cheesecake as they are $9 each."
G G.,"Port Orange, FL",0,11,5,1.0,6/23/2015,Found a brown curly hair on burger. They did offer another meal to replace that one but no customer service. They even still charged me for my drinks. The manager was rude and didn't care and the waitress was typical. I didn't make a big scene or ask for anything just was I would expect to happen if a hair is found. Place has gone down hill. Never had a problem at other cheesecake factories.
Anton D.,"Orlando, FL",60,9,2,3.0,6/4/2015,"Overall I like cheesecake factory but getting a table is a problem, you can see a formed line already at the entrance, guys make sure you have time before dining-in"
Mike M.,"Sparta, NJ",136,355,254,4.0,3/28/2012,"At the risk of saying what's already been said, I'm here to say it again... Had the great opportunity to meet my niece for dinner in Orlando and she chose the CCF for (presumably) the location halfway between her place and where I'm staying. She's really thoughtful that way :) Turns out that CCF happens to be one of her favorite spots. Like a good member of the family she normally eschews chains, but this is an exception because the food is consistently really good, the service normally competent, and the desserts are great.  Tonight all three hit!  Vietnamese tacos for us both, gumbo and miso salmon for entrees. All really tasty, very (too?) big portions. I don't care that the food may not be ""correct"" by some measures, it tastes great and at least at this chain you know they're cooking back there.  I had a great dinner. Thanks niece #1 for the reco!"
