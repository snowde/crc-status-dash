Danielle Z.,"Orlando, FL",611,148,83,3.0,12/24/2013,"I'm not a big fan of chains normally but The Cheesecake Factory is a-okay with me.  They have a HUGE menu that should have something for everyone, they offer a small breakfast menu offered all day/night, and they make a decent mocha.   I almost never get dessert as I'm always full (they give big portions) but they're obviously known for their cheesecake.  They also do brunch on Sundays which isn't great but it is decent.   This location is always packed being that it is attached to Milennia Mall but the staff is efficient and I've always been seated relatively quickly.  They have a small outdoor seating area which I prefer.  It is shaded and nice almost any time of year."
Brenda A.,"Summerville, SC",5,244,1,4.0,2/8/2016,"Popped in for a girls lunch on Super Bowl Sunday - it was busy but no wait. It seemed hectic though (maybe the proximity to Disney makes it seem stressful). Great waitress. Tip - there are lunch portions available for many of the entrees - Mom ordered the Shepherds Pie and Chick #1 ordered Alfredo - both came in lunch portion sizes. But for only a couple bucks more you get the dinner portion and have leftovers, you call it. I had the Skinnylicious Factory Chopped Salad - it was very tasty. Also had the Buffalo wings. The wings were served a bit cold and mushy but the flavor was there. Chick #2 had the Grilled Chicken Tostada - huge and smelled wonderful. All in all - it was a good lunch. Ordered two cheesecake slices to share - key lime - which was not really cheesecake - so don't bother; and a chocolate mousse cheesecake - very good. $100 for 5 - that's about right."
Alex G.,"Winter Garden, FL",16,5,3,5.0,6/25/2015,"If you are looking for a big menu and great food this is the right place to go. Whenever you come here request Ryan West, he is honestly the most helpful waiter I've ever had. No matter what you ask him he will be honest and help you find your perfect fit on the menu, some prices may be higher yet remember you are paying for great quality! I highly recommend coming here!"
Jackie S.,"Daytona Beach, FL",28,325,329,4.0,12/13/2011,"My fiance and I stopped at the Cheesecake Factory for dinner yesterday. We both ordered a burger off their extensive menu of over 300 items- it was very difficult to choose since everything sounded and even looked really good. I now have a list a mile long of all of the different dishes and desserts that I'd like to try. I had the Kobe burger with sauteed mushrooms and onions which was absolutely amazing, although it came out slightly undercooked for how I asked it to be prepared. My fiance had the famous cheesecake burger which came on sourdough french bread and was actually 2 burgers for the price of one. I had the lemon-raspberry cheesecake which was just one of the choices of the 30 that they had available. I can honestly say that it was the best cheesecake I've ever eaten. My fiance had a slice of their massive carrot cake which was pretty good also.  Our waitress Miranda was really nice and attentive.  As far as the overall feel of the dining room it was extremely loud and very difficult to hold a conversation with my fiance and with our waitress. I'm not sure if it was because of where we were sitting or not..  Overall- I look forward to returning to the Cheesecake factory and next time we will ask to sit some where else to see if the noise factor goes down."
Scott R.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",170,191,1154,4.0,9/1/2013,"Every now and again I get a craving to wait six hours to eat with tremendous waiting times, usually a great sign of a successful great restaurant. Although I never get past chapter 4 of the menu I do recommend order the small plates and appetizers over their meals. And always get the fried macaroni and cheese balls!! Staff is usually always pleasant and food has always been pretty consistent and fresh!! I prefer sitting  at the bar area where you are looked after much better then the tables.. If your a newbie to Cheesecake Factory get any cheesecake except the plain. There are so many to chose from. Think outside the slice"
Drew A.,"Gainesville, FL",449,33,5,2.0,9/5/2013,"Jessica, our server, is the only person we encountered among several staff and hosts that even remotely cracked a smile or made any attempt to welcome us or be polite at all.  The men's bathroom was very dirty. No stalls were usable.  The cheesecake was amazing. Not sure if its worth the cold shoulders of the staff and a 20 minute wait."
G S.,"Pueblo, CO",0,11,1,5.0,3/24/2016,this place was great good food had the pasta  CARBONARA   my wife had the Alfredo  highly recomended
Ivette R.,"Miami, FL",268,1047,251,5.0,10/9/2014,The Cheesecake Factory at Millenia Mall is awesome I had a pasta carbonara with the lettuce wraps MMMM mmmm good delicious I'm a fan of this place yummy food especially the strawberry cheesecakes and red velvet cheesecakes yummy restaurant bakery and bar and happy hour is awesome always will come back
Mary G.,"Mississauga, Canada",32,7,2,5.0,1/25/2015,Amazing selection of food as there is something on the menu for everyone. Food tastes great and the cheesecake is even better. My favourite restaurant to eat in every time I visit Orlando.
Teresa W.,"Orlando, FL",18,19,1,4.0,5/15/2014,"I adore Cheesecake Factory...I don't care that it's a chain. The menu is enormous: there's soul food, Cajun, varieties of Asian (takes on Thai, Chinese, Indian), seafood, steak, burgers, pizza, sandwiches, salads, skinny food, brunch, desserts and appetizers galore. No matter what mood you're in, there's something you'll enjoy. I have yet to try anything I dislike. My favorite dishes are the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp, which is a red, peanut coconut curry and the Jambalaya. I always make sure I get their delicious Strawberry Lemonade and this is the only restaurant I regularly take dessert home from. Service is spotty here, sometimes they're pretty slow. Depending on the time and day, the wait can be a bit ridiculous at this location (45 minutes or longer); however, it is in a mall and there are several stores w/in range of the buzzer they give you. Wish they took reservations...I've heard of other locations that do."
Greg O.,"Ottawa, Canada",14,61,,4.0,3/20/2015,"Great dinner experience. We showed up here around 6pm and had to wait ~20 minutes, but it was worth the wait. We tried the gumbo, orange chicken, spicy chicken and kids Mac and cheese. Everyone enjoyed a tasty - and generously-sized portion. Meaning that we had to have our cheesecake to go. The next day, when our appetites were back, we shared our lemon meringue, peanut gutter/chocolate, white chocolate/raspberry, chocolate/Carmel/pecan desserts, which were amazing. With a few cocktails, our total for two adults and three kids (two of whom ordered from the adult meal) was about $150."
Dana D.,"Orlando, FL",2,87,38,3.0,2/28/2015,Beware to wait awhile if you're trying to get a table during prime time or even late night on the weekends. The bar and the adjacent high tops are first come first serve so that's where I try & sneak in. I've been here many times with my favorite dish being the miso salmon. I've had mixed experiences here but overall it's a crowd pleaser if you know what you're walking into.
Roberto T.,"Orlando, FL",112,128,33,4.0,9/4/2013,"Don't let the name fool you. The meals are also quite good here. In fact, I actually have never eaten their cheese cake! My favorite appetizers are the calamari and spicy ahi tempura roll. My last dinner here was the Steak Diane; beef medallions with a peppery mushroom wine sauce and onion. Yumdilly-scrumptious!!! They also have a full liquor bar and I have been known to partake of their delicious sour apple martini. There are a host of various martinis that will please most palates! My favorite dessert is the Tiramisu. Let's just say I will definitely be back for more of that one! This location is great for lunch and dinner but it is always somewhat crowded. They even have a respectable brunch. The eggs Benedict and bruleed French toast are to die for! Other than being a little pricey, this a definitely a place to put on your to-do list."
Shon R.,"Orlando, FL",21,213,11,4.0,2/6/2013,"What else is there to say about the Cheesecake Factory? I have long been a fan of this chain of restaurants.  No matter what state or city I am in, I have always enjoyed hitting up the Cheesecake Factory for good food and service.   Fortunately, the Orlando location was the same as my other experiences.   The service was prompt and attentive. The best thing about The Cheesecake Factory is definitely its menu.  It is pretty difficult to not find something you want to try.  While some dishes are certainly better than others, I can't say there is anything I have particularly not liked that I have tried here. The downside to this place is that it always seems to be packed.  There is a good reason why, but definitely try to get there early to avoid the dinner crowd."
Jodie O.,"London, United Kingdom",48,163,43,5.0,7/3/2013,"We didn't eat any food here so this review is just for the cheesecake side of things, of which we ate loads!  I had read about this place on many different review sites and knew that while in Orlando I had to try their cheesecakes. We visited here twice and had red velvet, a coconut chocolate one, a coconut and pineapple one and a rich chocolate one. They all came with cream and were packed really well to take back to our hotel. Although the slices didn't look that huge to me, I discovered that they could feed two people no problem (which meant I got to save half of mine for the next day!). And they tasted amazing - with red velvet being my favourite.  Only wish there was one in London."
Chasity D.,"Orlando, FL",5,46,36,3.0,9/14/2012,"Decided to try something new with the family. I heard great things about The Cheesecake Factory and we all agreed to go today. We already knew what we wanted because we checked out the menu online.  The wait time was 25 minutes. The place looked nice but it was definitely crowded, which was expected. When we were seated we didn't get the booth that we requested but the hostess was extremely nice and made sure we were seated at a booth. Appetizer: Hot Spinach and Cheese Dip- My family liked it, I only tasted the chips.  Bread was okay but the butter was delicious. Food: Cajun Jambalaya Pasta- My brother thought it had no flavor, only spice. Grilled Salmon- My sister said it tasted like steak, I tasted it and it really did taste like steak with no flavor. Herb Crusted Salmon- No flavor. It was bad. The only good thing was the mashed potatoes. Herb Crusted Salmon and Shrimp Scampi- My mom said her salmon tasted like medicine, at least it tasted like something, unlike mine. She did not like the shrimp at all. Shrimp Scampi and Steak Diane- My dad is not a picky eater. He was the only one that ate all of his food but only enjoyed the mashed potatoes.  We were all disappointed and I was ready to give this place two stars but my brother said ""let me taste their cheesecake, it is called the Cheesecake Factory"". He ordered the red velvet cheesecake and liked it. My sister and I split the strawberry shortcake because we hate cheesecake. We were happy with our desserts and with the service we received so I changed my rating to three stars.  First and last time at TCF. This is what we get for venturing out of our normal routine. I'm glad others enjoy this place but what a waste, at least we were able to laugh about it and still enjoy our family night out."
Jessica M.,"Denver, CO",252,380,169,4.0,6/22/2013,"The Firefly martini has invaded my dreams.  Yeah it's $10, cost more than my lunch salad (holy crap that's a lunch portion???), but it is soooooo good! Firefly: Milagro Silver Tequila with Blood Orange, Passion Fruit, and a Splash of Prosecco"
Ted P.,"Windermere, FL",434,4,4,5.0,1/19/2015,"Great food, great service. 20 minute wait reduced to only 10. The best chocolate cheesecake on the planet"
Juan R.,"Orlando, FL",0,1,,2.0,3/7/2015,"It is a Saturday night I came in at 6:00pm and it is 8:10 and we still waiting for a Table. This is completely ridiculous. I will not come back Ever Again at this location  3/7/15 The restaurant have plenty of empty tables.,"
Dan H.,"Buffalo, NY",21,116,147,2.0,2/12/2013,"Same thing, different city. I am not a fan of chain restaurants and while I believe that there is clearly a place in the market for them, generally I find that it is not the place for me. I knew what I was getting into by choosing this but it was one of the few restaurants that I found that have outdoor seating and it beats the food court.   The service was perfunctory.  No attempt was made to connect with me and there was not much attention paid.  I made the unusual choice, at this kind of restaurant, to have the fish and chips.  This was based upon the waiter's recommendation.  Perhaps I have been spoiled by great fish fries that I have had in the past but the dish was barely passable. Oh well, I got sit outside and eat in January and that ain't nothin', I  guess...especially for a sun deprived northerner."
