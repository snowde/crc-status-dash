Samara K.,"Nashville, TN",0,18,1,4.0,1/9/2015,Went to the cheesecake factory on New Years Eve so it was busy as many would expect.  We were told the wait would be an hour but it was much closer to an hour and a half.  Once we were seated we had some beers and appetizers and then finished with cheesecake.  The food was fantastic.  Service was great.  But the cheesecake was best of all. But why else does anyone go to the cheesecake factory.  We had the cherry cheesecake and my personal favorite the Reese's Peanut Butter Cheesecake!
Ameesh P.,"Tampa, FL",295,594,269,4.0,3/30/2013,"Another Cheesecake Factory experience that did not disappoint.  I'm impartial to their vast selection and this location holds true to their traditional brand image.  I stopped by this location for lunch on a busy Saturday to meet a friend who was in from out of town.  Despite the crowds, they were able to seat us with virtually no wait and our server was on top of his game.  Drinks and food were delivered with utmost speed.  I went with my usual ""White Bean Chicken Chili"", which is amazing even with it being one of their healthier menu items. A great experience as to be expected from this chain, but it's good to know no matter what city you visit one in, the food and quality is consistent."
Morgan M.,"Orlando, FL",12,23,9,1.0,5/19/2014,"Update: they still could care less about their customers. Only here could I wait on hold for 5 minutes and still not get an answer. From their track record, I just gave up... Again."
Adam S.,"Northampton, United Kingdom",0,13,,4.0,2/6/2014,Popped in for a quick lunch on a Thursday. Got seated very quickly and we were soon tucking in to a chicken and club sandwiches which we both ended up not being able to finish due to lack of capacity in the belly region. Both of us enjoyed the food which we took the rest home in a box. Just had to buy a couple of slices of cheesecake to take home as well nom nom! Service was prompt and yes we will go back.
Dee M.,"Vista, CA",670,814,2965,5.0,6/12/2010,"5/5/10  Like many, I've eaten at Cheesecake Factory's all over the map. Honolulu, Maryland, Virginia, Scottsdale, San Diego -you name it and I've probably eaten there. Why? Because Cheesecake Factory continues to be one of my favorite restaurants. It's pretty reliable, the food is good, and the priced are right. This location tops the charts with their awesome customer service. They are really nice here. And I walked right in and got seated."
Itrish S.,"Orlando, FL",0,6,,2.0,11/28/2015,"I got the chicken Marcella and the tomato basil pasta. I also got the strawberry and raspberry lemonade. As an appetizer we got buffalo strips. The food and drinks were really good (4 stars). Although I was satisfied with the food, I was not satisfied with the customer service. Prior to going to the restaurant we tried to make reservations, but they said they don't take reservations. Then we had a 30 min wait. Subsequent to that, we had to wait another 5-10 minutes for the server to call our party name. It took our waitress another 30-40mins to get our bread and appetizers. Meanwhile, the people beside us came at the exact same time as us and got served earlier. When they got their entrees we were just getting our appetizer and bread. Our waitress had no attention to detail. At the end it was so late I didn't even have time to have dessert."
Carlos H.,"Tampa, FL",3388,792,1522,5.0,1/1/2009,"My family and I came here to just chill and order drinks the first time we came during our vacation and the waitress was quick to get us what we wanted. I ordered a Pina Coloda and I am convinced that the CF has some of the top quality Pina Colodas. My parents enjoyed their rum and cokes.  We were trying to find out where the Florida Mall was at and the waitress was very helpful in giving us good directions to get there. Then we came back again for breakfast after not finding a place at the IHOP by my house and my Mom and I had a delicious Huevos Rancheros for breakfast. This usually comes in huge doses so I was incredibly stuffed and satisfied by the time we were done. This is the first time I get sweet tea as well, when we got to the CF in Brandon they don't have sweet tea and give me a bland tea that I have to pour tons of sugar in, and I never can really get the right taste into it like in a already provided sweet tea. One of the things I love the most about the CF is the bread they give you while you wait for your food, and the sour dough bread was so delicious that I had more with my eggs, the perfect compliment to my meal. The waitress we had for breakfast was on her game and was funny and friendly, I really think CF employs the best."
C S.,"Ocoee, FL",1,51,1,4.0,10/19/2014,"Wait was crazy - over an hour - too many people. Food was tasty - best shrimp around and great tarter sauce. Jamaican Black Pepper shrimp was fantastic, but short on mango sauce. Service was fast efficient."
Mary V.,"Montreal, Canada",101,160,240,4.0,5/13/2012,"OMG! Yes, it's true Chef Gordon Ramsey would not approve of this Huge menu. Huge menu's usually equal very bad food. BUT, this place pulls it off!  So let's start with Appetizers: FRIED MAC & CHEESE BALLS!!! THE BEST BALLS I EVER HAD! LOL They are so good, I have to have them any time I am at the Factory. They are creamy, the pasta is cooked al dente, the crispy coating it perfect. If you like mac & cheese you'll love these balls!!! LOL Next, Chicken Pot Stickers, once again a winner. They are light, the wonton is great and the dipping sauce, mium. On to the meal: Go for the Specialty Item of Caramel chicken. Every bite is white meat, crispy, and the Vietnamese caramel sauce is soooo good. Mixed with the rice and veggies, it is an explosion of flavors! It is my favorite dish. The Kobe Burger, ordered medium rare, was really good. It was flavorful and juicy. Tried the Thai Chicken pasta, this was the least of my favorites. It was salty and the pasta was clumpy, I'd stick to something else. Now, the CAKE! I will go in order of goodness: 1. Pineapple Upside down cheesecake! OMG! 2 of my favorite cakes, in one! Just wonderful! 2. Lemon Raspberry Cream Cheesecake 3. Dulce De Leche Caramel Cheesecake The list can go on and on. Go on and try it out, it's fun and yummy! Go, go, go."
Mariella M.,"Daytona Beach, FL",16,5,,5.0,10/13/2014,I am never disappointed when I visit The Cheesecake Factory. The food is super good and the portions are huge. I tend to split my dish with someone and just order an extra side and still leave super full. Always leave room for dessert!!!!!
Michael G.,"Orlando, FL",60,261,506,4.0,7/16/2015,"Lots of times when I'm in Orlando, I end up eating here. Why? Well first of all, if you're craving some good cheesecake, you've come to the right place. Personally, I think I'm always craving cheesecake, especially from The Cheesecake Factory. This location is pretty centrally located in Orlando and located right near the highway. Despite its convenient location, there always seems to be a lot of traffic around Mall at Millenia, plus, good luck finding a parking spot near the entrance, but there is valet... I can't think of a time that I've come here and not had to wait for a table. Unfortunately, you can't make reservations in advance, so once you get up to the host/hostess you get on a wait list. Waits during prime lunch and dinner times, especially during the weekend can easily be over an hour. One good part about the wait, is you receive a text message when your table is ready. The food here is pretty consistent, which is definitely a positive, plus the complementary bread and butter is always delicious! They have a great grilled cheese here, but I highly recommend asking for cheddar instead of American cheese. The portions here are usually pretty big and there's no exception when it comes to the grilled cheese. They practically use a whole loaf of bread for the grilled cheese. I sometimes get the kids grilled cheese because the portion size is smaller but still more than enough. The ratio of bread to cheese is always perfect. I must say though the side of fries it comes with are nothing special. The fries are unusually slightly flimsy and don't have much flavor, but I've definitely had worse fries. The cheesecake is always my favorite part of the meal. You can't go wrong with any of the probably 25+ choices to choose from, but my favorite is by far the chocolate chip cookie dough cheesecake. Just to let you know, most cheesecakes come with whip cream already on top plus when you order they put more whip cream on. With the huge menu here, you're bound to find something that you like - and be prepared to end up getting some of your meal to go."
Jared V.,"Clermont, FL",44,194,17,4.0,5/12/2012,"I love this place.  I have liked the Cheesecake Factory since the first time I went to one in Chicago when I was 15.  The menu is ridiculously large-- it's a good thing this place is always packed because if they didn't sell everything on their menu regularly it would be a fortune to store all the wasted food. I have had several dishes but usually gravitate towards just a few after having some stuff I didn't care for.  I usually go for the cashew chicken or a burger, which they do really well.  I also almost always order an appetizer here (if you're gonna cheat on your diet, might as well do it right) and have found that their fried macaroni is excellent, as is their buffalo blasts.  There's never enough sauce or dressing for the buffalo blasts, and I always have to ask for extras at least twice (once to my server, and since they always forget when plating the dish, once to the person that brings me my food).   Of course the desserts are amazing.  They have really taken their namesake into consideration and make some truly excellent cheesecake.  Their hershey's chocolate cheesecake is outstanding.   The service at this location is pretty good. I've had pretty attentive service and have run out of beverage only a couple of times, but I have seen a couple of unprofessional things (a male server standing a couple of feet away from my table styling his hair and pulling it back into a ponytail, for instance).  Nothing to be too offended by, but still-- do that before you get to work or in the back so your guests don't see you putting your hands, hands that deliver food and beverages, all over your hair."
Seth N.,"Sanford, FL",1,5,,1.0,12/15/2014,"In the past I have normally been a fan of the Cheesecake Factory but my last few experiences in the past year, at this location, have been nothing but lackluster.  The service has been consistently mediocre to good, but where the fault lies is in the kitchen staff and their food prep. Every time the food has been prepared wrong and/or poorly. Notable examples include but are not limited to: Wasabi seared tuna-  Over seasoned and cooked all the way through. Mac and cheese burger ordered rare- Cheese was cold and bland and meat was medium, half burned. Smokehouse BBQ burger ordered rare-  Charred and well done. Etcetera etcetera.]  All in all, if I get a hankering for chicken and shrimp gumbo or Godiva chocolate cheesecake, I will be bringing my business to the Winter Park location, unless they too have grown just as incompetent."
Sylvia W.,"Orlando, FL",0,9,2,2.0,4/22/2015,"My friend and  I came here for lunch today. Unfortunately after today's experience I will not be back. We arrived and were seated by 12:05, we ordered around 12:20 and our food arrived COLD on our table at 12:50. Our order was very simple also. Today is Wednesday so they were not busy either. I ordered a cheeseburger and fry, my friend ordered eggs, bacon, and toast.  3 tables that were seated after us received their food and some were checking out as our cold food arrived. The manager or who I assume to be the manager  (because he did not introduce himself)  brought our drinks and took the cold food away no apology, no trying to make things right. When they brought the food back out you can tell it wasn't fresh but had been heated in the microwave. Our waitress had to ask for some of the food to be removed from the bill. The only apology given was from the waitress. I really shame management(Zac) for not handling this properly. When a guest has a long wait for food and receives cold food at least apologize. With so many restaurants in that area why choose this one?"
Aleema R.,"Orlando, FL",569,107,328,5.0,10/17/2012,After a wonderful day of shopping at the millennia mall. We decided to go to dinner here. Wait was a bit long but that's was fine. We ordered Mac and cheese balls and Thai chicken wrap for appetizer which was delicious. Dinner I ordered chicken di pana. The chicken was perfectly cooked and the sauce was great. Can't forget dessert we got the Godiva cheesecake and chocolate moose cheesecake! Love it!!!!!
Patty W.,"Lake Worth, FL",280,1063,1750,4.0,1/24/2012,"An overdue visit with one of my aunts was a memorable one.  My husband and I met up with her for dinner and it was awesome.  Cheesecake Factory never fails.  I settled for the orange chicken with white rice and no veggies.  I promise to get something different next time ;)  Our waiter did not rush us during our three hour visit.  We appreciated the fact that we had a lot to catch up on :)  Anyway, I had to get a cheesecake.  Hmm..which one though?  The damn choices are always so hard and I settled for the red velvet.  How delish!"
Mrs. Mary H.,"Orlando, FL",3,20,6,3.0,8/28/2014,The food and deserts at this Cheesecake Factory are great. The servers do a great job. The only problem is they are always so packed with lines. The lines are very frustrating.Sometimes over 1 1/2 hours to get in.Other than the wait it's a great restaurant.
Cindy L.,"Orlando, FL",10,26,2,5.0,6/19/2012,"My favorite place to go on the weekend.  My newest favorite dish is the Vegetable Salad.  It has Asparagus, Green Beans, Tomato, Cucumber, Roasted Beets, Apple, Edamame, Radicchio, Romaine and White Cheddar All Chopped with Pomegranate Vinaigrette.  All I can say is YUM!!  Never a bite left behind.   (No cheese for me please!)  I follow a pesce vegetarian diet, so it is always nice for me to find a dish at a chain restaurant that works with my lifestyle."
Robyn B.,"Orlando, FL",66,157,126,5.0,5/23/2014,"This restaurant is really good. They have sooooo many items on the menu it's almost overwhelming. Viewing the menu before hand may be helpful. For those who are attempting stay healthy, they have a really nice menu that offers several options. I've had a few and they were all great. This location is often crowded so if you haven't made a reservation be prepared to wait. The cheesecake is, of course, phenomenal. I try to order a different one each time I go and they've all been wonderful :)"
Brian S.,"Venice, FL",0,22,1,5.0,9/17/2014,Another great visit!  The food is very good and enough for two meals!  Had a GF burger and it was great!
