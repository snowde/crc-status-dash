Celine C.,"Oviedo, FL",115,196,42,4.0,4/9/2012,"This cheesecake factory is always super busy.  I suggest you arrive at least an hour earlier than your usual dinner time.  I think Cheesecake factory needs to have a better line at the hostess table because people were cutting!!!!  I had the fried zucchini and it was sooo good!  And it's only 5 bucks!   I always get the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp and that never fails me.  If you are a curry and coconut lover, you will enjoy this dish!  Their dishes are oversized so you can save half for lunch the next day.   Our server was nice.  The bread and appetizer came really quick.  She also offers us more bread and the water was always filled up."
Sharon M.,"Orlando, FL",95,53,50,5.0,6/18/2014,"the cheesecake bar is where its at! I have not dined here ""officially"" yet, but this review is for their cheese cakes! very yummy! the slices are big enough for two to share, maybe three if you aren't crazy into the sweetness! Favorites: Ultimate Red Velvet Cheesecake, Tiramisu and Chocolate Tuxedo cream!"
Lisa B.,"Green Bay, WI",0,5,,2.0,10/29/2015,"We have enjoyed lunch and dinner at many, many cheesecake factories around the country as we travel a lot for our work and also enjoy leisure travel.  This was by far the absolute worst Cheesecake Factory we have ever been to.  Upon walking in we noticed that the cheesecake case in the front was all covered in condensate.   We were taken to our table and the floor around our table was absolutely disgusting. It looked like they had wiped all the food and crumbs from 10 tables before us on the floor. A good portion of our table was covered in slimy goo that my husband put his arm in.  My dinner salad plate was gritty on one entire side and the salad was warm and wilted.  The service was ok but took a long time to get our check.  And to top off our experience a person in the booth next to us threw up on her plate during our meal.  I understand that was not at all the restaurants fault however it just made our experience worse.  We all felt like we needed to take a shower after we left and didn't enjoy our meal at all given the very uncleanliness that surrounded us."
Heather B.,"Eustis, FL",1,4,,1.0,10/24/2014,The cheesecake was awesome. The service was good. But we had 2 cold dishes one returned twice both times cold. My raspberry martini both times tasted like juice. Was expecting better food and drinks.
David M.,"Orlando, FL",0,38,12,5.0,10/18/2015,Food is always consistent at Cheesecake Factory!  Great selection. The only issue is the long wait!  But it shows how popular and quality to dine here.
Cy R.,"New York, NY",0,29,,5.0,10/1/2014,"Had an awesome time at Happy Hour. Was fortunate enough to sit with some friends at the bar.  Our server/Bartender was a well knowledged guy named Shannon.  As a drinker, I totally enjoy being able to talk drinks with any bar staff and this guy knew his stuff far moreso than any other chain restaurant i've dined in.  Friendly and professional. The food was great (as usual at the cheesecake factory) and I'm going to do my best to make it to Happy Hour more often and indulge in the well priced drinks and appetizers. PS - I love you Chicken Bellagio!"
Desi N.,"San Diego, CA",64,351,10,3.0,1/5/2014,Cheesecake Factory isn't the same everywhere you go so don't get your hopes up! I was excited about its location but disappointed with the food and service. I doubt I'll ever go back to this restaurant. It was over packed and definitely not where you want to go to unwind.
Danelle B.,"Sanford, FL",0,5,,4.0,9/13/2015,This restaurant was spectacular! Excellent service and faster than expected! The only downside was the unfortunate wait to be seated. Our reservation was set for 4:00 and we weren't seated until 4:20
Julie A.,"Gulf Shores, AL",11,47,30,5.0,6/10/2014,I'm never disappointed with CCF. loved that this one sent a text out when our table was ready! We were able to walk around the mall while we waited. Our waiter was fabulous and very good with the kids.  As always the food was great especially the cheesecake. It is now official that the Godiva chocolate is the best one in my opinion. I have officially tried each of the chocolates.
Anhay L.,"Hialeah, FL",0,4,1,5.0,1/15/2013,"Great food  Great service Clean My servers name was orlando he tool really good care of us , cared to answer all our very complex questions in a very patient and polite way(had it been me id had killed this guest) i really did ask a lot since it was my first time here... Desert=heaven!  Only thing i didnt like is how crowded that place was but i guess thats only a good thing and they cant help it!!!"
Josephine F.,"Kissimmee, FL",0,11,2,5.0,8/24/2015,"Love the atmosphere!  Sometimes it's too crowded, and it takes a while to get your table but worth the wait!  Cheesecake for desert is the best."
Robin E.,"Tallahassee, FL",11,18,58,4.0,4/29/2012,"Pretty much can't go bad with anything on the menu. The kids pizza is huge. 2 or three small kids can share it. The wait staff we had, David, was awesome!  A good idea is to split a salad and a meal. The portions are huge and I can eat."
Ed M.,"Deltona, FL",71,69,95,2.0,8/19/2012,Average service. Server more interested in larger tables so he missed out on my usual 20% tip. No attention to detail and had to ask for the most basic items. Had better service at other locations.
Simone D.,"Orlando, FL",527,4,,4.0,5/21/2014,"The menu is so vast it took us forever to order, but for someone that only eats seafood I was pleased to see there were so many options that I could choose from! I got the southern fried catfish and had plenty to take home."
Osy Y.,"Kissimmee, FL",38,34,72,4.0,6/11/2012,"We came back to the Cheesecake factory just a week ago. While the food was amazing as always, the service this time around was a bit shoddy. Also, our wait to get into the restaraunt was 30 minutes longer then they said it would be. [ instead of waiting 45 minutes for a table, we waited an hour & 15 minutes ]  We will still come back next time, [ yes, the food is THAT good ] but we just hope to have a better server. ~"
Michael C.,"Kissimmee, FL",0,6,,4.0,8/1/2014,I love the Cheesecake Factory. It's got a great location. The food always comes out delicious and hot. I know they reel you in with the free bread (who doesn't love warm pumpernickel bread) but the food is actually really good. And with the huge menu there is something for everyone trust me. On a busy night like the weekends it's a very long wait and can get kind of hectic. But that's really the only down side.
Karen B.,"Cincinnati, OH",111,119,2,3.0,5/11/2011,"I had only been to Cheesecake Factory once prior to the past week (when I went twice) and this time I actually had more than just cheesecake. I tried a few small plates since I wasn't starving at lunch time.  It's no lie that their cheesecakes are amazing ... Try to Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake or the Chocolate Tuxedo Cream Cheesecake (fudge cake, chocolate cheesecake, vanilla mascarpone mouse and chocolate). YUM. So indulgent.  So as most of my friends know, I'm a huge fan of avocado and I had NO idea they had Avocado Egg Rolls so I was ridiculously excited to try them. A beautiful plate came out with the egg rolls sliced in half and piping hot. The amazing colors of the avocado with the sun-dried tomato, red onion and cilantro wrapped and deep fried, gold brown were to die for. Tasting the blast of flavors when dipped in the Tamarind-Cashew sauce ... I seriously almost died and went to heaven. This appetizer is not something I would have guessed this place served ... or for that matter, I would not have thought it to be any good. Then I had the Ahi Tartare which, unfortunately, I was not so impressed by. It had more avocado, which I didn't know before I ordered, but it turned out to be less than yummy. The flavors were good and the presentation was nice, but the chewy, grittiness caught me off guard. I've had Ahi Tartare before but this time it didn't seem to be as fabulous. Our waiter, on a side note, was not very consoling when we complained about it ... or the fact that the glass my friend was drinking out of was chipped and he cut his lip on it. No offer of at LEAST comping the drinks. Anyway ... my friend had the chicken picatta which was actually JUST chicken without the picatta. Haha. It was lacking in the lemon flavor and could have used more capers. We ate it all... but it could have been more flavorful. As someone who definitely enjoys ordering chicken or veal picatta, I knew that this was lacking in the key ingredients. Overall, the cheesecake and avocado spring rolls will keep me coming back for TAKE OUT ... but the service and the meals will not."
Daniel B.,"Sanford, FL",27,143,47,4.0,5/20/2011,"We had a work outing to Cheesecake Factory today @ Mall of Millenia.  We felt like if it was our last lunch as fellow colleagues, employees and/or friends before the end of the world that we would attempt to make it a good one. My work friends are world-renowned Cheesecake Factory experts.  I would estimate that between them, they have visited Cheesecake Factory in at least 15 different cities nationwide.  The main impression that I was given was that Cheesecake Factory brought ridiculously inappropriate sized portions of food upon requesting an item off of the menu and that all of it was high quality. I wasn't skeptical, I mean these guys have a re-defined center of gravity that far exceeds my own and if this was their favorite restaurant in all of their travels who was I to question their judgement? First and most importantly, the bread was stellar.  I frequently judge a place by the bread that is delivered. We had a nice multi-grain and sourdough selection with real butter.  My dining partners both chose salads.  That selection was kind of ironic based on their enhanced figures, but I was assured that the 2 heads of lettuce per lunch salad serving would satisfy their most beastly nature and apparently, as the experts they were correct.  I stayed honest to my figure and went with the Orange Chicken.  The chicken was fresh and the coating was a nice crispy complement.  The orange glaze was perfect and the vegetables that come with the meal were very tasty comprising of snow peas, shredded carrots and zucchini.  Making things complete was an appropriate size portion of white rice. The real reason we came here was because my lunch mates found it hilarious that I have never tried cheesecake.  I am sort of a picky eater and always kind of skipped over it.  I've gotten a little better as I have gotten older but introducing the Cheesecake Factory virgin to their favorite place and celebrating the end of the world seemed like a good enough reason to take a 3 hour lunch.  The short story (after this novel) is that I like cheesecake and I like Cheesecake Factory.  I had no reason not to like cheesecake, but the selection I scooped from (Vanilla Bean) was completely amazing.  Feeling guilty, each of us called our wives and arranged to take pieces home to them too.  I had a good experience, and will probably go back sooner than later.  I was forewarned that it could be difficult to get in at peak hours.  It was a little noisy, but the interesting decor kept my beady little eyes happy.  The menu is almost intimidating with 16 pages (including ads WTF?).  I was frequently told during the one hour one-way trip there ""Everything is good; even though its a chain, I promise it doesn't suck"".  Truer words were never spoken to me during work hours and I plan on going back soon with my wife and the grrl."
Krystal G.,"Homestead, FL",71,24,4,4.0,3/8/2014,"Love this place, absolutely hate the wait and the fact they don't take reservations. Dinner wait time: 80 minutes- sucks!"
Elizabeth H.,"Orlando, FL",38,8,1,3.0,10/9/2011,"The wait was redonkulous.  I would highly recommend getting a reservation, especially on the weekends. The sweet potato fries are delicious and worth the extra dollar to get and the burgers are pretty good. It's hard to go wrong with the endless variety of cheesecakes, but, despite its namesake, I think my favorite dessert from here might actually be the strawberry shortcake."
