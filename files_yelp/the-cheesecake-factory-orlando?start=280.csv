Michelle F.,"Clermont, FL",0,15,,4.0,4/29/2015,"I've had mostly good experiences at this and other Cheesecake Factory locations. One particular not so good experience was quickly remedied by a fantastic manager, Todd. Because of him and his kindness I will definitely return to this busy location."
Matthew R.,"Lexington, SC",58,33,4,4.0,6/18/2013,"No matter what city I'm  in when I go to Cheesecake Factory it is never a disappointment.    I usually get the same order (Spicy Cashew Chicken), while my wife always tries something different.  The menu is so diverse that you can find what you are looking for to satisfy any pallete.  This goes for the main course and for dessert as well.  A great selection of cheesecakes."
Iryna S.,"Orlando, FL",45,145,9,5.0,8/27/2013,"one can never go wrong with Cheesecake Factory! this location, like any other, gets very busy, so even at 10 pm they still had wait. Wasn't long though and the bartender made it seem even shorter. Overall, we always have good experience at cheesecake factory."
Gigi R.,"Orlando, FL",6,174,302,4.0,1/1/2014,I come here for dinner often especially after a hard day of shopping! If you come here during the dinner rush (6 PM-8 PM) parking by the food court is impossible and the wait for the restaurant is pretty long since it's so popular. I suggest try beating the rush by eating during happy hour 4-6 PM. Eating on the patio during happy hour (4-6 PM) when good weather permits is pretty enjoyable. My favorite dishes consist of the meat loaf and BBQ burger. And of course who can say no to the cheesecakes?
Jolie L.,"Windermere, FL",0,71,6,5.0,10/23/2012,"The Cheesecake Factory is absolutely delicious!! One of my favourite places. Only thing I dislike sometimes is the really long wait but thats how good this place is.  First off, the strawberry lemonade is the best ever! apart from Chili's. So yummy and fresh you could never go wrong with this. The burgers are always great but my favourite dish that I always get is the 4 cheese pasta. Very common and nothing too different but this dish is so delicous, especially their ricotta cheese.  My other favourite is the bang bang chicken and shrimp. There is more than enough in any of Cheesecake's dishes. You'll never go home feeling hungry and may have left overs for the next day. This dish is yummy and so flavourful!  I'd reccomend this place to anyone"
Victor C.,"Orlando, FL",68,122,4,2.0,12/15/2013,"Real bad service today. It seems like they are not ready for the Sunday/Holiday rush. Servers seemed confused. They mostly are saying ""Sorry about that."" Food arriving before appetizers and food taking a long time to arrive. Foreign guests aren't helping either."
Alexa M.,"Orlando, FL",0,4,,1.0,5/14/2015,"Terrible service at Cheesecake Factory at Millenia. I called in to place an order and spoke to the General manager-- he was very rude and unaccomodating. After unapologetically denying my request to order food to be served at the bar, he proceeded to argue with me. When I told him he was providing horrible service and was not conducting business appropriately, he then (rudely and sarcastically) asked me where I work. Definitely never going to this locationg again."
Lizzy C.,"Jacksonville, FL",175,80,103,5.0,3/3/2013,"I know it is cliche' to like chain restaurants this much, but in my mind, Cheesecake Factory never disappoints. We were visiting Universal Studios in Orlando & wanted to steer clear of City Walk, so we came to the Millenia area & chose to dine at Cheesecake instead. It was about 8:15, and we were told there was a 45 min wait (not surprising). We were lucky, though, and found a high-top at the bar immediately without waiting.       We both ordered 20 oz craft beers ($8) and received them within minutes. I had the baja chicken tacos which were served in corn tortillas with avocado, fresh creme, tomatos & cheese. They were very tasty but I had to eat them sans-tortilla due to the tortillas being so fragile & falling apart. Otherwise, was not disappointed with my order.       My husband has the Shepherds Pie & it was AMAZING! It came out piping hot with a mushroom gravy, carrots, mashed potatoes & beef. I probably ate half of his dish too. We were too stuffed for cheesecake & opted for a couple laps around the mall following the meal. Overall, excellent service, speed & taste! Love this place"
Eva B.,"Orlando, FL",40,31,121,5.0,5/30/2011,"Great customer service! We had a huge group of 26 people celebrating my friends birthday. Nothing special to this location versus others but the reason I give this place 5 stars is because their great customer service. Because the only reason you constantly go to places is the customer service. Both the hostess and servers were extremely accommodating and patient. In fact my group came in on a domino effect, so they sat the first part of our group and waited until the surrounding tables opened up & the rest of our group came. Very helpful! Needless to say my friend had a fun birthday because the safe made it easy to just enjoy the night."
Caleb T.,"Orlando, FL",0,39,2,4.0,1/11/2015,The Cheesecake Factory well first of all make sure you save room for cheesecake cause it's amazing. I try to get something different every time I go and will have to say the only thing i have not enjoyed was the orange chicken. I only have to complaints it's loud and their menu is so big its a little over whelming. Other than that it's rather good.
Shyrra B.,"Alexandria, VA",15,103,21,5.0,11/24/2012,"The place gets super packed, because, come on, it's mall of millennia, but food was amazing and service was great."
Elizabeth R.,"Los Angeles, CA",66,214,34,3.0,1/20/2013,"This is a great cheesecake factory, and I am happy about the new skinnylicious menu! I got the veggie burger, its under 560 calories which is great...I felt it was a little underseasoned but thats nothing that a little ranch dressing won't fix!!! Best thing to do is to stalk the bar area and pick a table that is leaving soon and wait right next to it like a creep, otherwise you will be waiting for an hour."
Michele A.,"Columbia, MD",0,10,,5.0,3/28/2014,"Yum!! When I say I like cheesecake, I mean I like cheesecake. Which was the whole reason we decided upon The Cheesecake Factory for dinner.  We got a nice table and were seated in about thirty minutes, which wasn't too bad because the mall was right there, but longer than I would'veliked. The service was friendly, but nothing really outstanding.  When we got to look at the menu, it had a lot of different foods which was awesome. You can overdo variety but they had just enough for everyone to be happy.  Dinner was especially yummy and when we got cheesecake, I settled with the mango key lime cheesecake it was so good. I love their cheesecakes and they'll always be the best to me.  Besides the medium wait, I love this place and can't wait to go back again!"
JEWELe M.,"Atlanta, GA",162,417,14,4.0,6/25/2011,"I am not too fond of chain restaurants, but I do not mind nomming @ Cheesecake Factory. Where else can you get delicious drink concoctions, huge entrees and NOW ""Small plates"" (which are STILL huge), and of course a delicious assortment of cheesecakes?!??! This visit, I took my mom here for dessert, but we ended up getting two small plates:  Vietnamese tacos & Buffalo Chicken Strips in addition to our strawberry cheesecake (which we had to share because I was full from sharing the ""small plates""). The ""Vietnamese tacos"" was tasty with its rice flour bun (similar to FIlipino siapao) and spicy meat & pickled daikon.  Of course I have never been to an authentic Viet spot where it serves these tacos, but this was a nice spin on the Asian cuisine. The Buffalo Blasts chicken strips were delicious and amazingly huge!  I love the crispiness and tangy flavor of the spicy wrapper.  Loved them! Like I said before, Cheesecake Factory is where its at for awesome drinks, delicious foods, & dope cheesecakes!"
Fernanda D.,"Campeche, Mexico",30,216,745,4.0,5/18/2009,"I always order the same thing: chicken madeira! It's the best dish and I also love their margarita's. Oh, and I almost forgot their Godiva cheesecake for dessert! :-) Yes, they are always busy, it's loud, the service is not always the best but this dish is the best!!!!"
Leah P.,"Fort Worth, TX",52,89,46,5.0,6/17/2013,Absolutely fabulous. Our waitress was always filling our drinks and bringing us whatever we asked for. The calamari was cooked perfectly and the pizza is to die for. We loved our experience - and of course the Chocolate Chip Cookiedough Cheesecake
Cristina A.,"Hollywood, FL",0,17,,4.0,3/9/2014,"I thoroughly enjoyed everything at ye place ... The food, service, ambiance, and of course the cheesecake"
Dolly P.,"Charleston, SC",1,15,11,1.0,1/18/2015,"This was a mistake. Food way overpriced and all the entrees tasted like they had freezer burn before cooking - especially the ""famous meatloaf"" . One person in our party wanted a slight change in her entree that would have been super easy for any cook and the waiter said they couldn't make changes. We all left without eating much of our entrees. The mashed potatoes and salads were good, and the cheesecakes were good. But for the price you will get better in almost any other restaurant. We won't go back."
Nashadyr S.,"Winter Garden, FL",1,16,6,4.0,3/6/2014,"I love TCF their food is good my husband And i favorite is the farfalle pasta. We came over And had a farfalle each And it was soo good my server was very good but in a short period time She was gone not for long but i wanted some parmesan on my pasta And the server next to us was passing by And i asked her if She Could get me some And She said sure, so when She came over with the cheese She poured the whole plate of cheese on it they usually pour it little by little and ask when to stop she just threw the whole plate of cheese on it and my pasta was no longer good it was salty of all the cheese, my husband told me he saw a bad attitude in her face maybe because she wasn't our server and he was really pissed and told me he wanted to speak to the manager but I told him it was okey, I would have put a 5 star if that didn't happened other than that everything was good thank you!"
Nathalie F.,"Saint Cloud, FL",47,13,3,2.0,4/1/2015,Busy as always but they seated us swiftly. Our sever was attentive and polite. Good job on his part. However the restaurant and its food is overrated. How such a busy restaurant runs out of carbonation for their soda is beyond me. The alternative was water or lemonade and water was definitely the way to go. The lemonade was tart and quite disgusting. The food itself was decent. Our fried macaroni and cheese appetizer was really nice and the highlight of our meal. My husband's pasta was undercooked as were my vegetables. Not somewhere I would go visit again.
