Nathalie M.,"Miami, FL",25,50,5,5.0,6/1/2013,"We ordered the Chicken Bellagio and Classic Burger for pick up after a long day at Island's of Adventure and also our last night in Orlando. The food was AMAZING! The lady who gave us our food was very nice and accommodating, making sure we had everything we needed before we walked out the door. I was really surprised how nice the staff was since we had ordered a few minutes before they closed on a busy Sunday night. I definitely you stop by and eat at this Cheesecake!"
Nique T.,"Orlando, FL",0,10,6,1.0,2/23/2015,"I hate this Cheesecake Factory! Very Disappointed! I had the worst experience ever on 2/13/2015. Not only was the wait 1 hour and 30 minutes but I also ordered food today as I was dining and when I got home all the food was not in the bag after I paid and tip. I called the Cheesecake Factory back and the restaurant manager told me that he will process the refund and I have not yet to see a refund. I've been calling the restaurant at the Millenia Mall Orlando, Florida location and I've been getting the run around every since the back office lady said that she was going to call me back and she never called back. I feel like I've been robbed! I expected better customer service from this restaurant chain!"
Stanley S.,"Winter Garden, FL",2,163,,2.0,2/13/2015,"We hadn't been to a Cheesecake Factory in a few years so decided to go back. It was your typical Cheesecake Factory experience. If nothing else, they are consistent. ( I think though I am souring more and more each day on chain restaurants. They are becoming like institutional food with no character). The Cheesecake here remains excellent but way overpriced. My reaction to the meal reflects the whole process: meh, I can take it or leave it. Nothing bad but nothing memorable."
Bryan P.,"Ormond Beach, FL",17,85,3,4.0,7/24/2013,One of the better burgers I've had great service casual atmosphere
Scott B.,"Panama City, FL",22,167,74,4.0,7/15/2013,"The family had a good meal here, attentive servers and lots of food equals a win!"
Allie C.,"Orlando, FL",89,95,12,4.0,4/15/2011,"I really hate giving 5 stars to something so commerical, but it really is wonderful everytime we go. I think the meal that stands out the most is what my boyfriend gets, though I will not because of the price. The shrimp scampi is wonderful. I am particular about shrimp, and these were great. They tasted fresh, were pletiful on the plate, and very large. Hard to come by the three of those combined.  The small plate options are great for a wide variety eater, and affordable in my opinion. Drinks can be a alittle weak for the price. I'd pass on anything mixed and stick with a good wine if it is in your budget. Oh, and of course, the cheesecake. Always goood, no matter what we choose. Very rich, large prices. These are worth the 6-9 dollars a slice, anyday.  Service for the most part is always good. It can get quite busy here, so I never expect to be topped off every 5 minutes, but thats normally the case. It's always a simple and good choice."
Adriana R.,"Seattle, WA",74,83,16,3.0,9/26/2012,"Food is great. Service is awesome. I didn't like the fact that the menu is massive, the portions are ridiculously enormous, and that the tables are so close together. I would visit this restaurant again but next time I will share my dish."
Chance S.,"Orlando, FL",10,96,2,5.0,4/13/2013,"This is my favorite chain restaurant. Whether here or in Winter Park, or any other city in USA... they never disappoint me. I can try something new on the menu with confidence. There mojitos are very good... especially for $5 during happy hour(4pm-6pm). The lighter eaters probably good could order an appetizer and not need to order a main meal. There appetizer portions are huge!"
Vanda V.,"Orlando, FL",0,7,,5.0,1/18/2014,Nice and average pricing place to dine in.  5 plates make 8 people.left sated.  only the sever  was a little surprised when  we ordered that little.  I mean plates were cheesy stuff. WE did pack the food home and of course the cheese   a must
Christina F.,"Kissimmee, FL",128,441,18,4.0,10/28/2010,"Came here the other night around 11pm (They are open until 12:30am on weekends) mostly just for a snack and to hang out for a while. I have been  to Cheesecake Factories everywhere, and they are usually a good safe bet. This one fell right in line with expectations. We had the Mini Chicken Sandwich appetizer, and added fries for $1.00 more, which ends up making it about entree sized for two people. I also, as always enjoyed the free bread. The little sandwiches were good, very Chick-Fil-A like...I ended up taking one home for the next day.  Total cost about $12 with tip."
Megan H.,"Vallejo, CA",35,82,18,5.0,7/26/2013,"It's the Cheesecake Factory, need I say more? Big portions, great price, always leftovers, cheesecake is a must and that is just...... I'm speechless. Cheesecake is my fav and they had me at hello. Firecracker appetizer, yes."
Andrew K.,"Orlando, FL",382,140,137,5.0,7/27/2010,"I love cheesecake factory,   I always get something different...but really, with a menu that huge who wouldn't!  Bang bang chicken and shrimp, chicken madiera/shrimp scampi combination, Louisiana chicken pasta...i could go on and on but those are a few of my favorites.  Cheesecake is great but always get it to go because i am always so full.  Would be a great place to meet friends for a drink before getting sassy downtown or even around millenia.  Love it long time.  if you wanna take me there...i will accept your invitation."
Charles V.,"Longwood, FL",5,69,69,4.0,3/18/2013,Good food and good service.  the problem is its so packed with people that anytime you go there there is a huge wait.
Ryan M.,"Fenton, MI",14,36,93,3.0,1/13/2011,"Dinner Review:  This was my second time at a cheesecake factory.  My opinion, menu is large (an entire book), everything is just ""good"".  So.....   When you have a group and no one can decide if they want Italian, Chinese, American, or a bistro.....   This is your place. Atmosphere:  I'm not a fan.  It's loud, big, crowded.   Desert I would give 4 stars, but yelp won't let me rate twice."
Fergal M.,"Ballyconnell, Republic of Ireland",19,2,9,5.0,9/26/2013,"Fabulous meal, great sized portions, excellent service, waited less than 10 mins to be seated and it was extremely busy. 10 out of 10"
Sharon P.,"RAYMOND, OH",4,44,,4.0,4/24/2012,"Well, I'm a fan anyway....not sure my dinner date is a fan.  I ordered Cashew Chicken, very yummy!  Dinner date had Macaroni & Cheeseburger -- we think she got food poisioning from it.  Was up for 3 hours vomiting and what-not!  It was either that or the banana creme cheesecake.... either way, I doubt that she will be back any time soon."
Jennifer M.,"Orlando, FL",142,286,1107,4.0,8/15/2010,"Nice atmosphere, located at the Mall of Millenia.  Delicious food (the avocado egg rolls are the best!).  Great service.  The menu has such a wide range of appetizer and entree selections, it's sometimes hard to make a decision.  The full service bar serves up some nice drink specialities.  They are known for their vast cheesecake selections- the red velvet is divine!  This particular location gets busy and is normally pretty packed, especially on the weekends."
Shirly X.,"Windermere, FL",63,32,10,1.0,11/27/2013,"I'm only giving this place one star because of the cheesecake! I went in last night and asked the hostess for the wait time for 7 people, she said 50 minutes and I was fine with that. The problem occurred after, when she asked me again how many people and I said 7 and a baby (if that makes a difference). She rudely replied ""Well that's 8 and the wait time is different"". After a few minutes, she then said the wait time was 2 HOURS!!! I was taken by surprise and told her that we would like the take the table for 7. She then snarled ""You have a baby. That makes it 8, not 7"" and I replied ""It's a baby! He can sit on my lap!"" Then she went on and rolled her eyes at me and said ""Fine. Whatever you want"" I was so close to hitting her. I wanted to start yelling at her for being so rude! I'm never going here again for dinner. I called the elephant bar right after to see their wait time and they're wasn't any at all so we just went there and received amazing service."
Tommy ..,"Orlando, FL",396,239,99,3.0,3/28/2012,Great (tasting) food but horrible for you.  Some of their basic healthy sounding items are some of the worst most unhealthy foods in America.  Many of their dishes are over 2000 heart clogging calories in one sitting!!!!  BUT... it tastes great! :)
Jason A.,"Chesapeake, VA",181,51,,2.0,3/20/2012,"Great cheesecake, as expected. The food menu is WAYYY TOO BIGGG!!!!  We sat at the bar and the bartenders were all pretty curt, borderline rude. Nothing pretty to look at either, males and females. For the price you would think they could be a little nicer."
