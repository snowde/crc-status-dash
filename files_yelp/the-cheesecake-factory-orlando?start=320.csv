Steve L.,"San Mateo, CA",833,684,1066,3.0,8/26/2009,"We knew we were going to find our way here during our vacation. I guess they didn't have enough funnel cakes, ice cream, cotton candy, turkey legs, and chicken nuggets while we were at WDW Magic Kingdom, because they wanted cheesecake.  This location is a little drive away from the theme parks, located in the Millenia Mall.  We arrived 7PM on a Wednesday night.  Even though it was a weekday night, it was still crowded, and we expected the usual wait for a table. We were handed a pager and were told the wait would be 30 minutes. Not bad.  After 45 minutes, we inquired on the status of our table, and were told one would be ready soon. Ten minutes later, our name was called, and we met with one of the hostesses. She escorted our group to our table, only to find that it wasn't cleaned from the previous party. With no apology, she just told us to wait back in the waiting area.  My wife noticed that there was a table set up for 7, and asked the hostess if this table was really meant for us. We were told it was being held for another party of 7, but they haven't all arrived. Since we knew that Cheesecake Factory does not take reservations, we asked why wasn't this table given to us. With no answer, we asked to speak with a manager.  Finally we were seated, and asked the waiter if we can speak with a manager. He promptly brought him over and asked why the table wasn't available. He said they were waiting for the other table's entire party to arrive, but did acknowledge that the available table should have been given to us. What's more, he found out that the entire group of the first party didn't arrive, and the remainder of that group were already seated.  The manager apologized, and promised to do everything he can to make it up. Not only did he expedite our orders, he also helped our waiter serve them to our table. The waiter himself was very pleasant and very attentive.  The kids ordered the kids' bow-tie pastas of butter and parmesan, meat sauce, and chicken fingers. All of their orders were the famously huge Cheesecake Factory quantities.  After a day of theme-park food, most of the adults ordered salads (also to save room for dessert). The wives shared the Luau salad, which consisted of grilled chicken layered with mixed greens, cucumbers, peppers, beans carrots, and mangoes, all layered between two large wonton sheets, all in a vinaigrette. A very colorful presentation, and very tasty as well  My friend ordered an appetizer-sized Caesar salad with chicken breast. Again, even for a appetizer size, this salad was pretty sizable.  For myself, I ordered the Navajo Sandwich, which was a grilled chicken sandwich with avocado, lettuce, tomato, and red onion between a warm fry bread, with a side of their fries. (yes, you'd think I had enough fried food for the day, but apparently not). Good, sandwich, but didn't get to eat the fries because the kids went ahead and took them from my plate.  Couldn't forget about dessert, so most of us ordered cheese cakes:  Fresh Strawberry  Original  Chocolate Tuxedo Cream  Pineapple upside down Cheesecake (special of the day)  All were served promptly to our table. All were good and satisfied our sweet teeth, especially mine.  One of the kids ordered a kid's sundae, and a kid's strawberry and cream. The latter was for my daughter and was actually in error. She wanted a fresh strawberry for herself, which I purchased to go on the way out.  To ensure he would make up for the mix up for our tables, the manager comp'd for our desserts.  The responsiveness and the indifference from the front desk staff, who are the face of the restaurant, would have soured the dining experience for us, and would have prompted me to give a low rating. Instead, the prompt responsiveness from the manager, and the great service from our waiter indeed sweetened our evening, and offsetted the front desk's indifference.  The manager said that he will speak with the front desk on this to prevent the way the seating of our party was handled, and how to improve on their management of their waiting list, the availability of tables.  From the way he personally made up for them, I believe he will.  Why only 3 stars? Not because of the service, I still find their food as a chain OK, but will give this location another try if I'm back in the area."
Mary B.,"Tallahassee, FL",5,33,18,5.0,1/21/2012,"Always delicious food! However, there is always a wait when I go, so reservations are a must or be prepared to wait! The wait staff is friendly, knowledgable and helpful, ready to recommend their favorites. The menu is huge and covers a lot of different kinds of food, but I'm always drawn to their chicken entrees. As for their desserts... they don't call it The Cheesecake Factory for nothing! SO many options, and I have yet to try one I didn't like!"
Kylie R.,"Davenport, FL",1,5,,4.0,10/5/2013,I really enjoy this restaurant. We always sit at the bar you get way better service and you do not have to wait as long. We like to order off the small plate and appetizer menu. We then split a burger which they cook a perfect medium rare. We always save room for cheesecake. My favorite is the pumpkin cheese cake which only comes out in the fall.
Emile P.,"Marietta, GA",209,26,,5.0,7/31/2012,Cheesecake Factory's home made veggie burger is delicious!!!  Cooked and seasoned very well. Their fried Macaroni cheese balls are a must for my kids. They love them!! The wait was only 20 mins at about 3p. Great choice all the time.
Thom M.,"Kissimmee, FL",0,20,,4.0,11/20/2012,"Went here and everything was almost too perfect, that I went back a week later and was still good. Got sat outside instead of waiting for an inside table and got seated faster. It was a beautiful evening, spicy ahi tuna tempura appetizer was fantastic. Chicken piccata was good, Moroccan  chicken even better. Next week steak was ok a little tough, Thai bang bang chicken and shrimp was great. Atmosphere was nice both inside and out. First week waiter was a bit slow as if he was overwhelmed, the next week the waitress was good also. The prices are a little up there but worth it! If you go with a large group expect to wait to be seated about an hour and as always groups always get a gratuity added on."
Randolph A.,"Orlando, FL",39,15,4,5.0,11/14/2011,"I they would let me have a bed in this place I would call it my  New home, LOL...  very clean fun place to friends and family when they come in from out of town. The Staff is Great and make it a fun place to eat before you hit the Millenia Mall near by. there is a endless variety of cheesecakes, nom, nom, nom"
J R.,"Miami, FL",19,157,357,4.0,2/29/2012,"Great food, awesome cheesecakes, friendly staff. Happy hour at the bar has good specials and fun bartenders."
D D.,"Nashville, TN",5,37,133,4.0,2/25/2012,Even though I went at a busy time I was seated within 5 minutes. Our server was prompt and very friendly (J. R.) Having been to this restaurant several times I try to get something different because the choices are numerous. I ordered the herb salmon with shrimp scampi. My 3 shrimp were huge. The salmon was somewhat bland. My husband ordered the chicken and shrimp jambalaya. It was good! If you like spicy food I'd recommend that. Overall very satisfied with our food and service
Adriane W.,"Orlando, FL",14,6,,4.0,5/24/2010,"First off, I'm actually not a huge fan of cheesecake (or sweets in general for that matter). BUT Cheesecake's food really impresses me so I'm obligated to go!  I am a huge critic when it comes to salads. I LOVE salads seeing as how I'm a vegetarian so they're considered a major food group to me. Their caesar salad is awesome! And most of their other salads as well. I also order their Thai Chicken Pasta (minus chicken of course) which is always superb.  Although the edamame was a bit salty, still very tasty. Our waiter kept the beer coming- which always gets you points in my book! And I also love the fact that this location is in the Millenia Mall...shopping :)"
Family V.,"Inverness, FL",0,45,,3.0,7/12/2012,"Our first experience was in Anamheim (LA), together wit our son we went yesterday to this place. Good situated. Waiting time 70(!) minutes. I ordered an appetizer, but the waiter forgot to bring it. The (original) mojito is delicious here (not cheap : 11 dollar). My son got the farfalle with roasted chicken. He liked it (not the chicken). My husband got the hibachi steak. Was ok, the potatoes were lovely. I had the New Orleans shrimps together with white rice. It was just OK, nothing special. Total price : 82 dollar. In general : portions too much. Food not bad at all, but we had no whauw effect. Waiter forgot also to refill the coke."
Hungry G.,"Portland, ME",0,53,8,5.0,4/29/2010,"We always love to dine at the Cheesecake Factory when we are away from home. Delicious! Large portions. Great service.  Walking the Millenial Mall after dinner allows for burning off some calories. We had the red velvet, layered cheesecake for dessert. Wow! Delicious and plenty to share for two."
Jay K.,"Oshawa, Canada",0,50,26,4.0,2/6/2010,"One of our favroite restaurants when we visit Orlando. The menu is extensive, the prices are reasonable and the patio is very inviting in the evening."
James H.,"Jamaica, NY",0,4,,5.0,3/14/2014,Amazing place to eat. Portions are massive. I had the pulled pork sandwich and I couldn't come close to finishing it. Best I've ever had. And of course you have to have a slice of cheesecake for dessert. Ate here twice on our vacation. Prices are very reasonable for the quality of the food and portion size. Excellent work!
Jen M.,"Springfield, MA",11,144,2,5.0,9/28/2011,Best service you will find anywhere!!!! I have 0 complaints about this restaurant and considering I walked in hating this chain with a passion that is saying a lot.
Scott J.,"Orlando, FL",2,10,,3.0,10/21/2008,"Do people really go here to eat meals?  Somehow I end up here for dessert only. I do think they are overpriced for what you get.  Still, the best part of eating these decedent cheesecakes is figuring out if I am more guilty for all the fat and calories, or for the price you were so willing to pay!"
Lenore F.,"Orlando, FL",19,36,6,4.0,6/19/2011,"I really love the Cheesecake Factory (even if it is a chain) but rarely go because of price. However, now that they have ""small plates"" on the menu I am thrilled! The Vietnamese tacos and dynamite shrimp are both excellent, and a great-size portion for their prices. Plus, it leaves you with room for cheesecake! I have never ordered anything bad at this restaurant, which is quite a feat considering the size of the menu."
Oscar C.,"Orlando, FL",100,13,10,3.0,10/9/2011,"Ate there yesterday, and I do like their food , they have a large selection of dishes for almost anything you are in the mood for. Of course the one thing I dont like and has always been the case for every cheesecake factory I have ever gone to is the insane wait. I am not big on having to wait an hour to an hour and half just to sit down and eat. The food may be good but not that insanely good. Saddly this does mark down a peg for me."
Marc G.,"Altamonte Springs, FL",537,49,1,3.0,10/10/2010,"Ate at the Cheesecake Factory in Fort Lauderdale on Las Olas.  While the food was good, again issues with the service.  The waitress literally dropped our dinners on the table and almost ran away.  I had to go to the wait station to get a steak knife and condiments for us.  We had to almost literally grab her on a couple of occasions."
Jennifer K.,"Bradenton, FL",84,189,183,4.0,3/23/2011,Long wait but service was quick once we were seated.  Always come for dessert!  Key lime cheesecake is my favorite.  FYI - the snickers cheesecake was too sweet.
Brian A.,"Orlando, FL",341,140,5,4.0,5/1/2011,"I prefer more authentic restaurants but Cheesecake Factory is always consistent each time I go. The food is excellent, as well as the drinks. I almost always get the salmon with asparagus and mashed potatoes, they give you alot of food, its an all around awesome place."
