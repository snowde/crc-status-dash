Steven T.,"Groveland, FL",51,46,11,4.0,4/28/2010,"Cheesecake Factory has one of the friendliest staffs I have ever come across. They take the time to explain the menu specials and give their personal heart felt opinions on things that they personally enjoy, instead of trying to push the most expensive thing on the menu. Even though its a chain restaurant, it remains near the top of my favorite places to dine."
Chris H.,"Lake Mary, FL",2,5,,4.0,5/19/2013,Food and service great as usual. Be prepared to wait at least 45 min to an hour for a table though.
Lauren C.,"Orlando, FL",11,102,,2.0,1/7/2008,Typical.  Boring.  Good chopped salad. Loudness.  And I think the waiter was high.  Pretty entertaining.
Dee W.,"Evanston, IL",187,1570,1299,4.0,9/19/2006,Funny - we would fly out to another state and end up eating dinner at a Cheesecake Factory but when the food is so good - you can't help it. I made myself try something new which consisted of the avocado eggrolls which was absolutely delish - it was really fresh inside but the outside was fried. yum!  The vanilla bean cheesecake is still something out of this world. As my friends had forewarned me - eating anywhere in Orlando with a group bigger than 4 would take at least a 1.5 hour to 2 hour wait - we waited a solid 90 minutes before we were seated.
Bizzle H.,"Orlando, FL",0,6,,5.0,2/23/2012,"The Cheesecake Factory is wonderful! This location is in a great location, always busy and always amazing. The service is great. It is a little expensive, but hey... It's the Cheesecake Factory. The chicken wontons are a must, they are cheesy with great flavor and an unexpected crunch of water chestnuts that makes them their signature appetizer."
Travis S.,"Seattle, WA",13,75,11,4.0,8/29/2009,"Great food, as always.  Excellent service from Jordan, Matt et al at the bar."
Mike C.,"Long Beach, CA",743,435,731,5.0,1/19/2009,"I can't speak for anyone else, but  my experience there was more than pleasant! I took my girlfriend back in 2007 for her birthday, because I had heard people talk about the cheesecake factory but had never actually been there before (sad I know).  Our waiter was warm, and was not bugging us every 2 minutes asking if we were okay either.  There was a little bit of a wait prior to being seated, but that is common with most restaurants that have slight prestige.  The helpings of food were large, and did our taste buds justice.  For dessert we each had one of their custom slices of cheesecake and when I say RICH in flavor, I mean RICH.  It is no wonder this place is notorious for their cheesecake, because I have yet to eat cheesecake that was as tantalizing as theirs.  We actually came back the next day   just for some cheesecake to go.  If you do not choose to stay for dinner, at the very LEAST try their cheesecake.  You'll be glad you did!"
Katherine G.,"Morehead City, NC",0,13,,2.0,2/2/2010,I love their cheesecakes but watch out because some of them are very sweet and to sweet for my taste. Me and some friends ate here for a birthday celebration and I had never been. I was impressed with the wait staff but the food was way to expensive for what you got! I ordered the shrimp scampi and it was around $20/plate and it wasn't even traditional scampi like I thought. I even asked the waiter if it was over pasta or in butter and he told me it was in butter. When I received my scampi it was on pasta. When I asked him about it he just shrugged it off I was not impressed. The drinks were good but pricey. Overall if your going to just get some dessert I would say go for it but if your going for dinner go spend your money somewhere else!
Steve M.,"Winter Garden, FL",0,22,,4.0,10/12/2010,"You will end up there eventually and you know it! And so I did. It is what it is! Don't knock it. Yes it's loud, busy and brash but you can't stop loving it. Located next to the Millenia Mall, it's ideally placed for you to go mental on the calories and then take a brisk walk up and down the mall at double quick speed to help pacify your conscience. What can I say? The interior is colourful. The staff are friendly and greet you with a smile. The seating leaves a little to be desired unless you are successful in securing a booth or a table outside where you can sit and watch the world and his dog go by. There is a full bar and the food menu caters for all tastes - I can thoroughly recommend the Shepherd's Pie! OK so you're supposed to like cheesecake but it's not obligatory. You can quite happily tip toe through the menu and not eat a single slice! Yes people will think you're odd but don't be put off. Simply make out you've already had your cheesecake quota for the day! The price is reasonable and your mother will like it....as I said, you'll end up there eventually!"
Steve P.,"Orlando, FL",86,74,10,3.0,5/18/2010,"Personally, I don't get it. I meet so many people who just love the Cheesecake Factory but in my mind, they're just average. The menu is HUGE, almost ridiculously huge but I guess that's what they're known for besides, of course, their cheesecake. I have always found the food to be good (good and average) and consistent with large portions. And of course there's the cheesecake, YUM! It's hard to find a bad slice of cheesecake here. But there is no WOW factor here for me. The prices are a little steep in my opinion for the quality of food you receive. But what do I know...... the Cheesecake Factory locations are always huge (like their menu) and always seem to be on a wait for a table anytime I've gone so they must be doing something right."
Stacie M.,"Glenmoore, PA",0,10,,5.0,4/10/2013,"Where do I begin?  Tremendous experience last weekend!  I love visiting Cheesecake Factory and the one near my home is customarily at two hour wait.  So, I arrived at this location in vacation-town USA expecting something similar.  I was pleasantly surprised when I was greeted and told for my party of two it would be a 10-minute wait.  When I requested a booth, she then replied, ""20 minutes.""  This was great!  I was so pleased.  Within 13 minutes our buzzer went off and we went up to the counter to be seated. At other Cheesecake Factorys I have been to you then wait in a small line among others who are also being seated so I thought nothing of it.  The manager then walks up to my husband and I and tells us he is terribly sorry for the inconvenience and he will be giving us a free appetizer.  My husband and I did not even realize there was an inconvenience because this little pause is very common at other locations.  We were kind of confused why he seemed so eager to help us and when we were actually seated we learned from the hostess that there was another party who seated themselves in what was supposed to be our booth.  So, they scrambled to find another booth for us.  While we were ordering our drinks, the manager came over to our table, apologized for the inconvenience and told our waiter that we were to receive a FREE APPETIZER AND FREE CHEESECAKE!  He again thanked us for our patience and apologized.  We could not believe it.  It was amazing customer service!  Most restaurants do not care too much about pleasing their guests.  This manager, Shannon, went above and beyond and we cannot say enough about his interest in making the guest experience a fabulous one.  Additionally, the food was excellent!  Very fresh, hot and tasty!  I will certainly be revisiting this location!"
Mia K.,"Baton Rouge, LA",235,497,18,4.0,4/20/2008,"Delicious appetizers, food, and desserts.  Their pastas rival Italian Eateries.  The service is always great - smile on the face type thing, and banana cream OR Godiva cheesecake.  Yummm my mouth is watering!"
Juggy W.,"La Jolla, CA",14,215,15,2.0,5/4/2007,Overpriced and overrated.  There is always a long line here and the food is only mediocre.  Get over it people!
Kay P.,"Hingham, MA",0,23,1,5.0,5/17/2010,"The best chain restaurant I have ever been to. The meals were served very professionally. It was like I was at a fancy restaurant. The presentation, the ambiance, the air, the portion was above average. It was a very pleasent experience."
