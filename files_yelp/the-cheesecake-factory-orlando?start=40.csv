Christian J.,"Orlando, FL",48,55,70,3.0,2/25/2017,"So I went to Cheesecake Factory for me and my boyfriend's anniversary. The reason I did not give Cheesecake 4 or 5 stars is because I felt like the service was not GREAT. I'll start with the negatives.  The server I had that night really did not seem too invested in us, and it made me wonder if it was because we are both young, maybe she felt like we might not tip her as well? I'm not sure. But she seemed more invested in the tables around us. We sat with dirty plates for at least 10 minutes, as she helped tables around us. And when she brought the final receipt she said HERE YOU GO, and smiled and left. I'm thinking when you bring the check you should be very kind since they are about to tip you. Say THANK YOU FOR DINING WITH US TONIGHT, HAVE A GREAT NIGHT. Another thing that bothered me that as I walked out I walked past about 7 employees, 3 which were at the hostess desk, and NO ONE said have a good night. So even though the food was perfect, i wondered ARE OTHER LOCATIONS FRIENDLIER? Now to the positives! I got the chicken Madeira again, and it's great because it's pretty light it very satisfying and flavorful. My boyfriend got the same thing he got the first time he went, which I can't remember the name of the plate, but it hadc782123d-68e1-470d-8493-042632e23bee chicken and spaghetti I tomato sauce, and he specifically wanted to come to Cheesecake Factory to have this same plate again. We had drinks as well, and both my peach frozen drink and his pina colada were very tasted. We were so full that we had ZERO room for dessert. That's one great thing about this restaurant, is that you get your money's worth. Again, the food was wonderful, the service was just not anything to compliment."
P J.,"Orlando, FL",1,14,,1.0,11/12/2017,"Would not recommend for Sunday brunch. It is worth the wait to try other local places like Keke's, first watch, hash house and slate  Service was really slow and the kitchen staff put 0 effort into preparing the meals...meals came out at various times so half the party was almost done eating by the time others got their food.  Plenty of other better breakfast and brunch places around town."
Paul G.,"Orlando, FL",138,647,1085,3.0,12/21/2016,"WARNING: If you make a reservation, you have a 10-minute window. You WILL lose your reservation if you you go beyond that, and will have to wait for a seat. No questions asked. We came here for our team's Christmas lunch. Needless to say we got back to the office later than expected. That said, the food and service were really good. I had the crab bites, samosas, and dynamite shrimp. All were very good, and I'd get any one of them again. I am extremely bummed that they no longer have the shrimp BLT. That used to be my go-to entree. Doubt I'll be rushing back here again. Oh well.  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
Bill S.,"Delray Beach, FL",488,808,638,4.0,11/16/2016,"What can you say about a beautiful restaurant that serves huge portions of delicious food from a huge menu and then offers dessert of some of the most amazing cheesecake on the planet. There are tons of reviews on yelp for this location and my favorites are the miso salmon dinner and the chicken picatta dinner.  As far as dessert is concerned - everything is good here, so you can't go wrong with any choice."
Puro S.,"Dallas, TX",3,105,165,2.0,2/21/2017,"Food: 5/10 Service: 7/10 Value: 6/10 Ambience: 7/10 TL;DR - Okay appetizer, bad entree, terribad dessert. Be prepared to pass out 12 hours if you order the artichoke dip (YMMV). Finally caved in per my girlfriend's request. The menu didn't look that intimidating in person to my surprised. We ordered thai salad (good but too much work/10), crab/artichoke dip (9/10), salmon/steak combo (6/10), and strawberry shortcake (2/10). Service was fine, seating was a bit cramped but not too bad. I probably should have tried a slice of cheesecake, but the price is a bit steep. We went home and passed out for 12 hours and concluded that the artichoke dip was the culprit. Probably won't be back again any time soon."
Amy M.,"Davenport, FL",28,13,5,4.0,11/9/2017,Lunch was served fast even though the restaurant was very busy. Only complaint was that one person in the party didn't receive the correct salad and we had to ask for refills.
Maria Luisa E.,"Tallahassee, FL",19,20,10,5.0,11/8/2017,"Who would not like Cheesecake Factory? From the awesome food to their unmatched cheese cake, this place is undoubtedly one of the best there is. Even their interior design is with class. I am trying to eat here at every city I visit. I hope they build one in Tallahassee, FL someday.  I hope they continue to do great & serve their customers with the best."
Gordon M.,"Orlando, FL",2,20,51,5.0,7/26/2017,Been a while since our last visit. Had exceptional service and food very good. Had the Seared Ahi Tuna plate and a pasta dish.  All good.  The new Cheesecake APP works well. Try it. Even can pay check through the APP.
Alex Z.,"Orlando, FL",103,53,22,5.0,9/27/2017,"Boom, 5 Stars - they hit on all cylinders!  If you've read my reviews, you know I don't just give out 5 stars.  I think that great food and service is 4 stars and require that something extra for 5.  But my last trip here, the food was great, but the reason for the 5th star was 100% because of the best service I've had in a long time from our waiter Yassine!  TCF has a 20 page menu, so they have whatever your stomach is craving.  The portions are enough for two meals, so while the choices may be a couple more dollars than your used to, you have to remember that you also are getting two meals with each meal you order.  One for now, one for later.  I had the truffle fried chicken and it came with two gigantic chicken breasts and what seemed like a pound of mashed potatoes.  It was hot and delicious, but I enjoyed it just as much the next day when it was cold and straight out of my fridge (haha).  Yassine anticipated all our needs and ones we didn't even know we had.  He was on top of his game with extra bread, wet wipes for the baby, banana slices for the toddler, providing small extras we didn't ask for, prompt, and just the right amount of interaction.  There is a wait at this location usually and it is warranted.  Arrive early or call ahead to avoid it!  Oh yeah, they have cheesecake too :-)"
Shirley G.,"Houston, TX",15,169,163,3.0,6/13/2017,"I'm avocado egg roll was on point. I recommend everyone to try it!! However the entrees were not as amazing. The Louisiana chicken pasta was dry and lacked salt. My husband had the filet minion, it was okay. Nothing special to come back for. Our waitress was sweet that's why I gave them three stars"
Jared H.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,4,,1.0,10/29/2017,"Worst Cheesecake location ever, they act like they don't care whether you're there or not. Unprofessional to say the least and the food wasn't even as good as most locations. Embarrassing to have it there at such a nice mall,  horrible anchor restaurant indeed."
Kim C.,"Bigfork, MT",25,168,198,3.0,4/12/2017,I love this place. They are always consistent. I love the Bang Bang chicken and shrimp. There's plenty for lunch the next day. With loads of meat and shrimp. I ask for it extra spicy. It has a sweet hot flavor. The rice is delicious too it's a nutty brown rice. Great price point.
Glorimar W.,"Orlando, FL",0,60,13,1.0,12/15/2017,"Absolutely terrible. We were there for 4 hours. They told us the wait would be 90 minutes. To make matters worse, our apps took forever and were mediocre at best. Our food took forever and they served my youngest like 20 minutes after everyone else got their food. A kids meal! Our server then tried to charge me $3.95 for the drink that came with his kids meal. I pointed it out to her and she said,""I'll see if they will take it off.""  Wrong answer. My 8 year old ordered it. It was in front of him, I had my own drink. Terrible service. Never again. Save your money and go to Brio or PF Chang's!"
Fred P.,"Fort Wayne, IN",49,227,17,4.0,3/6/2016,"Stopped here for lunch one day while melting the credit card inside the Mall of Millenia.  We didn't have to wait long, which was nice.  The decor of the restaurant was amazing.  The menu selection was very diverse and enticing.   I had the bacon bacon burger and was not disappointed.  The French fries were also very crisp and fresh.  What really stood out was the side of ranch dressing my wife ordered.  It was very tasty so I ordered my own.   For dessert we split a slice of red velvet cheesecake.  Warning - the slices are huge.  It was exquisite and we weren't able to finish it.  Our server was very nice and efficient."
Nancy F.,"Chula Vista, CA",24,10,6,4.0,12/4/2017,"This is probably the first time I come in and have a great experience with a server this young man Patrick jardim, has suck positive attitude and is a great server . He had great positive attitude & made me enjoy my food , he was so helpful & kind . I'd be coming back for sure I really enjoyed my time here @ Cheesecake Factory ."
Ron B.,"Arlington Heights, IL",33,1,,5.0,12/11/2017,"The experience here was phenomenal. The staff as well as the customers were so warm and welcoming . We were treated like royalty (no exaggeration). Everyone showed gestures of gratitude and even asked to take pictures with us.  We came for a meal and left with much more than just our bellies filled. Our hearts were filled as well. Thank you for the experience. Special Thanks to Mr. Benny Perez, Mrs. Jessica Black, Ms Celeste Polanco,  and Mr Velan Wagner."
Chris F.,"Orlando, FL",0,48,1,4.0,10/14/2017,"Once finally greeted, everything was right on point. You can't go wrong with the Thai lettuce wraps. Extremely busy, but very very good"
Annabelle M.,"Ormond Beach, FL",68,46,187,4.0,7/16/2017,The food was awesome and the service was great this place is so busy. We celebrated my daughter lunch here. The staff was so nice we love going to all cheesecake factory.
Alison T.,"Mandeville, LA",0,3,,5.0,12/10/2017,The managers were incredible. We walked in got take out in military uniform and they made sure everything we needed was handled and we didn't have to wait long since we were still working. Superb customer service!! The food was incredible!!! Top notch. Southwest Airlines could learn a few things from this restaurant
Stephanie B.,"Orlando, FL",322,195,295,4.0,7/22/2016,Keeping it short because what can I say about Cheesecake Factory that everyone doesn't already know?  This location is pretty much always packed. Like two hour wait packed. I've found that as long as you come before 2 pm you shouldn't have to wait too long.  Outdoor and indoor seating. But who wants to eat doors in the Florida summer?  Decent Cheesecake Factory.
