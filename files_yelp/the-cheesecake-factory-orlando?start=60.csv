Lori T.,"Oviedo, FL",31,177,33,4.0,3/7/2017,"Decent food, large quantities, but a bit pricey overall.  I do enjoying visiting every so often, but would probably visit more if the prices were more appropriate.    Service is always good. . ."
Jack W.,"Garden Grove, CA",2,19,83,4.0,5/14/2017,"You know what to expect. Pretty crowded all the time, and chaotic. I like the food, and the cheesecake though.  Kind of pricey, but they give you big portions."
Ashlee J.,"Orlando, FL",2,27,12,4.0,4/1/2017,"Came to Cheesecake Factory for desserts. Got the chicken potstickers as a starter, always a good choice but a bit overpriced.....it's like $11 for 5 potstickers! The dessert we had were the Warm apple crisps. The best apple crisps we've had in a while. We eat here all the time but its good to have a dessert option that isn't just cheesecake."
Lisa C.,"Miramar, FL",803,404,1477,5.0,8/31/2015,"(This 5 star rating is for the yummiest veggie burger I've ever had!) I had no idea the surprise I was in for when I ordered the veggie burger at Cheesecake! What a yummy, most delicious surprise. It helped because the waiter who served us is a vegetarian himself and he raved on and on about it. In his own words, ""you'll be very pleased"", and I was. Their veggie burger is made with brown rice, red peppers, onions, and some other ingredients that I've never experienced before in a veggie burger. It was different, filling, and so, so good. I highly recommend you give it a try. That night hubby and I decided on sitting outside, under the palm trees that light the walk-way at this location. It was a beautiful, quiet, night right after I held my Goddess Gathering. I wanted to be alone, with my husband and enjoy his company with some good food. I accomplished that and I'll forever rave about having the best veggie burger to this date. My husband had the salmon and kale salad which was very good as well.  Even though it was a Monday night they were still very busy. This location is attached to one of the busiest, popular malls in Orlando and that night the restaurant was packed. But because it was just him and I we were seated in a reasonable amount of time. Our waiter was awesome. He added to the pleasant experience."
Allison M.,"Miami, FL",0,12,3,2.0,10/3/2017,"I've truly become disappointed in the Cheesecake Factory. For one, Millena mall I can sure say it's mighty busy restaurant. I waited about an hour and a half to sit at a table for me and my dad around lunch time on Sunday. Nicole was my waitress. She was a bit snobby and rude. The food didn't take too long but it didn't come out hot or even barely warm.   She didn't offer us desert at the end or anything, and we didn't get water refills the whole time. She just placed the check on the table after us eating. The saddest part is that she wasn't clearly busy if she had time to be on her phone in the corner. And the WORST part of our whole experience was that she was kissing some tall server in front of guests!!!!!! That is so UNPROFESSIONAL in any job to do that. The managers should clearly take action into someone like that and result her in termination immediately. Guest are and never will be comfortable with that sort of atmosphere while eating."
Brenda R.,"Orlando, FL",52,86,1,2.0,10/27/2017,"My friends and I were celebrating my early birthday dinner, a party of 4. We waited for about half an hour and got seated. I didn't know our waitress' name. She asked for our drinks, we decided a no for getting appetizers. As we gave her our orders, I got the chicken ""pizza"" with spaghetti, my friend got the teriyaki chicken, other friend got the jumbalaya, and the other got a chicken pasta dish, we waited more than 45min. The other table were seated and got bread. We didn't get any bread. So when we saw her, we had to ask. I thought that was poor customer service. When I bread came, we looked like animals from the jungle. We were starving. Then, our food came and for that, we don't have any complaints. It was delicious. We got our cheesecake, I had lemon raspberry which is my all time favorite, my friend got the red velvet, my other friend got the banana, and the other got a regular cheesecake. Then and our lady just gave us the bill all together. Didn't even ask if it's all together, separate, or half. Again, we had to tell her. After, we all spoke, laughed, and cried, it was time to go, my friend wanted a bigger bag, our waitress said she'll come back, but never did. I had to tell the busboy to give us one. The only thing I enjoyed was the food and my friends being there. Not our waitress."
Larry F.,"Oviedo, FL",18,53,5,4.0,12/31/2016,"Good place to meet out of town visitors. The restaurant was easy for them to find, plenty of mall parking, and tons of menu choices to satisfy a wide range of people. The service was excellent, the food was well cooked, and the place was clean.  Surprisingly for a rather busy Christmas week day the food was prepared and served fairly quickly, and we had between us a range of different meals from soup and salads, burgers and salmon. Everyone's meal looked highly appetizing. We were there for lunch, and my friend got the Soup and Sandwich. Now, that looked like a hearty meal that I may need to try next time. I had the Caesar's salad w/chicken, which was good. My wife was full, so she gave me half her mushroom burger and some fries. I really didn't need it, my salad was plenty, but what the heck it was Christmas week! Good burger. Sorry, we didn't stay for desert, but I going to guess their Cheese Cake is good. Next time, maybe. I would say the restaurant is equal or better than most of the casual dining places I've eaten at such as Applebees, Cheddars, Claim Jumpers, Denny's, Perkins, etc. I would diffidently eat here again if I was in mode for a simple but well cooked meal. We ate inside. They do have outdoor seating that I think would be much nicer for our next visit while it's still cool out here in Orlando."
Murat B.,"Toronto, Canada",6,11,56,5.0,3/14/2017,"My kids love this place. Even if they are absolutely tired, they won't resist Cheesecake Factory!"
William T.,"Lakeland, FL",88,39,34,5.0,2/13/2017,"I got the California Cheesesteak which was very good with right combination of peppers, onions and mushrooms on a very crispy piece of bread. My wife got her regular item in the pork chop with mashed potatoes and sautéed spinach. Her meal was on point cooked to her perfection which is very important as she likes every piece of meat cooked dead. To finish the meal we had Dulce de Leche cheesecake and was as always tremendous"
Mike A.,"Birmingham, United Kingdom",3,15,,1.0,5/7/2017,"Have visited this location many times but have put off somewhat after today's visit. Initially told 40 mins for a table for 2 which was fine and we were prepared to wait. When called for our table we were herded into a ""holding area"" in a walkway with about 6 other groups who all waited, including us an initial  10 mins to be seated. Waitress was very friendly and chatty, orders were taken promptly to and drinks kept full. We then waited over 20 minutes for our apertisers, just some sharing nachos, which were delicious, bit wasn't happy with the delay. Then waited an additional 25 minutes for entrées to arrive, both simple burgers.  Mac & Cheese burger arrived cold, Mac & Cheese was refrigerator cold, sent it back after having to spit it out! Then waited an additional 20 minutes for a fresh burger to arrive, by which point my partner had finished and i had to rush eating mine. No discount provided except for an apology from our waitress and deterred from ordering deserts.  I will probably visit cheesecake factory again but not this location."
Nora A.,"Stoughton, MA",1,16,72,4.0,7/17/2017,"First of all, it is super super busy. Monday night and 1 hour and 15 minute wait time for dinner. The thing that my family and I noticed right away is the lack of care for the maximum occupancy. Inside it was WAY overcrowded and no one seemed to care. What if a fire broke out and no one could escape quick enough because the management is not professional enough. This is such. serious issue and should be taken to a higher level. It was hard to breathe and the air was hot. No AC.  So if you are claustrophobic, this would be a horrible experience. Super loud and chaotic, people waiting around everywhere, I got pushed around from the waiters too. Food was great though!!"
Mercy P.,"Lake Mary, FL",100,119,381,4.0,12/27/2016,This is a regular place for us when shopping. Love to sit in the bar area and get personal service from the bar guys! Food is always consistent and more then you ever want. I love the freshness of the salads and the food! A must try if and when you shop at Milenia Mall
Grace L.,"Austin, TX",151,218,1542,4.0,3/29/2016,"Was excited to visit this mall and eat here on a casual Sunday of our vacation. Heard many cool things about the Mall of the Millenia. We tried to hit here for an early lunch knowing how it gets packed but still the wait was super long :/ Got some shopping done while we waited and came back to find out they never really logged our buzzer in :/ was worried we got bumped but they squeezed us in for a late 2pm lunch :(  But like everywhere Cheesecake takes forever with their food, however the taste is always pretty consistent. The kids meals were so cute and ample-mini corn dogs. I like to get the huge club sandwich bc it's so shareable :) We love their fries! My husband and daughter love the Navajo Taco! It's not on the menu anymore but this location made it for them. So props to them. My teen son loves their Americano burger-so huge. Again we love their fries! Such a huge lunch. Service was good but again always super busy here. Funny how we never are able to enjoy a slice of Cheesecake bc we get so stuffed ;) Great lunch spot if you are at this mall. Feels extra relaxing to eat in here vs the food court esp on a trip! Enjoyed it!"
Tiffany B.,"Tavares, FL",30,53,53,4.0,2/8/2017,"This was my first time going to this place with my friends. I would say that we had a great time. The food were amazing. They have plenty of food, drinks, and desserts to choose from. Their Godiva cheese cake were a little overwhelming for me. Ive tried some cheesecake that are not too sweet and just right, but I felt like this particular cheesecake were too sweet and after a couple bites.. You don't want anymore. They're pricey too so you don't wanna waste money when you order something. However, I love their pina colada. It was the best I've had in a while. The service were good too. They were a little bit slow in the beginning and we have to constantly flagged them but my friends and I were just talking and socializing so we had fun and try not to pay attention to the service that day. Otherwise the place atmosphere were amazing!"
Mar S.,"Carson, CA",0,14,,4.0,6/13/2017,"Came in visiting from CA while touring Orlando. Wait for late lunch at 2pm on Sat was 20mins so not bad. Our server Justin was very attentive and always checked in on us even though it was a busy time. Caesar Salad, Raspberry Truffle Pie & Iced Sweet Tea were the bomb!!! Farfalle and Carbonara were cooked a little saltier than CA versions so taking off one star."
Matthew M.,"Downtown, Orlando, FL",48,4,,2.0,12/9/2016,"I came in with a party of 5 on a Friday lunch about 12:30. We were greeted by our server and our drink order was taken. When the drinks were delivered we put our food order in. Then we waited.... 35 minutes later, one of the people in our group had their food delivered. A turkey sandwich and a side of soup. 7 more minutes elapse and 3 more entrees were delivered. The last person in our party finally received their food 5 minutes after that. A turkey burger. For my meal I ordered the shrimp spring rolls as an app (which I received with my food) and a veggie burger. I know veggie burgers can be hit or miss but this was a miss. Mostly comprised of rice than the veggies also listed it was very very dry. I thought I should send it back but I already waited this long for this bad attempt at a veggie burger. So I asked for extra ketchup and mayonnaise to try to make it a little less like a hockey puck. The spring rolls were good though, but it would have been nice to have earlier. I have been to this location before in a much busier time and service was way more prompt. This will not be a location I pick to go eat of my own choosing at any point in the future."
Celeste R.,"New York, NY",29,27,11,5.0,5/25/2017,"Went for lunch and got the lunch grilled salmon with broccoli and mashed potatoes. It was just the right portion for a mid day meal. The atmosphere is great and very chill. Didn't get the Cheesecake this time, but maybe the next round."
Joy N.,"Orlando, FL",76,7,16,3.0,6/6/2017,I give it a 3 just because the server was very nice. But the chef is a whole different story I order green bean on the side mine came out dry and plain. When I order sautéed in butter they gave me steam instead also it just look unappetizing.My husband order the ribeye with a side of green bean what they did was unbelievable so they probably use my green beans and cut the ends off and reuse it in my husband plate all you see is the end of the beans. How do you suppose to eat that!? When I ask about it the server didn't even know how to explain that. I think service was good but kitchen really messed it up.
Darby L.,"Tallahassee, FL",0,8,2,1.0,7/14/2017,"Awful.  Awful.  Awful.  Terrible rude server (Bianca), rarely returned to the table.  Shouted at us when we asked her to please wait on us.   Spent lots of time at some tables, ignored us.   Urged us to get drink refills to go.  F off, Cheesecake Factory.  We'll find s new place."
Carlus M.,"Panama City Beach, FL",16,50,,4.0,10/7/2017,"We had excellent service at this location.  The wait was rather long, but the food was very good."
