Ebony W.,"Tampa, FL",54,9,2,3.0,6/10/2017,"Food was subpar ordered hibachi steak wait time was more then 30 minutes after ordering finally came potatoes were hot in some places cold in others, asparagus was cut up into bit size pieces like I needed help eating them.... smh but they were fried and totally over done and uneatable had one piece and spit it back out. So overall the food was a hit or miss but that definitely was a miss I will not be having that again."
Michael M.,"Orlando, FL",260,1027,1636,4.0,2/8/2015,"This location is crazy busy, especially on the weekend. Be ready to wait 50 minutes or more. They have a great text notification system which lets you know when your table is ready. I got the text and was at reception within a few minutes. It did take about 15 minutes more to actually be seated which was disappointing.  After being seated our drink and app order was taken in a reasonable amount of time. 10 minutes later our drinks arrived and about 5 minutes after that the fried mac n cheese came. The fried mac n cheese is really tasty but I was confused if I should eat it with my hands or with a fork and knife. No worries I did both and either way works ok.  We made our entree order and I chose the Chicken and Shrimp gumbo. When it arrived it looked and smelled delicious. I am happy to report that it tasted very good too especially after kicking it up a notch with hot sauce. I like my gumbo spicy. The cheesecake here is good but not great in my opinion. The number of options is incredible but call me boring. I like a big, dense piece of plain cheesecake. The way it should be. A great cheesecake doesnt need four or five ingedients stuffed inside. Great cheesecake just needs a fork."
Gregg H.,"Orlando, FL",25,70,1,5.0,5/28/2017,"I always love this place.  Service is not always perfect, but the food is always amazing.  I prefer when it is not so busy.  Cheesecake is the bomb.  Burgers are much better than anywhere else.  Factory nachos are so great but they are fried flour tortillas, just so you know.  They have very healthy fare as well.  I tried the superfood salad and that was very good and filling.  I really think we come for the atmosphere and the perfect food.  Off hours like 3pm to 5pm are really the best time to go."
Antoine F.,"Detroit, MI",26,52,44,5.0,11/4/2016,The overall experience at cheese cake factory was very nice the decor and service was terrific dining outside made it a gorgeous lunch experience sun and fun will return love it....
Brian R.,"Kissimmee, FL",0,11,1,5.0,6/5/2017,"I love this place! Great service, don't have to wait too long. I'm absolutely infatuated with the White Chocolate Caramel Macadamia Nut Cheesecake. I get it every single time."
Sarah S.,"Clonsilla, Dublin, Republic of Ireland",63,344,1978,5.0,4/19/2015,"By far my most visited Cheesecake Factory! I've come here anytime I've been in Orlando for lunch or just cheesecake and coffee. The menu is HUGE and that's before you get to cheesecake. My favourite menu item for lunch is the chicken sliders. Cheesecake - I've tried the Godiva chocolate, the Oreo & their Ultimate Red Velvet (which is my favourite by a mile) If you're ever shopping at Mall at Millenia you should go here to refuel!"
George V.,"Gainesville, FL",46,168,365,5.0,2/28/2016,"Busy but anyway waiting time 10 mins. Our waitress had about 6 tables and still pretty good job. Then the food. Waiting time around 20 mins but delicious. Pasta jambalaya was really really good. My girl had china style steak with mash potato and delicious too. Mash nice, meat cooked nice. It was nice dinner there :)"
George B.,"Orlando, FL",78,14,38,2.0,1/30/2016,"Went for brunch on Sunday around 11am. It wasn't crowded at all. Despite that, my gf and i stood at the host stand for a good several minutes while the two hostesses gossiped and completely ignored us until the manager came out and admonished them. Our server Vanessa seemed nice the few times we saw her, but her service was deplorable. She never brought us anything we asked for and generally was not ever within sight of our table. Truly poor service, unfortunately. The food was good when we finally received it. I had the crab hash, she had huevos rancheros; both were delicious (see pictures). Overall a bad experience due entirely to staff incompetence."
Ann L.,"Kenansville, FL",14,37,274,4.0,10/19/2016,"Stopped by for cheesecake and ended up sharing a meal.   The meals are large enough for 2 and left just enough space for a piece of cheesecake.  The restaurant was busy and we waited for over 30 minutes for our meal,  but did enjoy the warm bread brought to the table.   We order the farfelle with chicken and roasted garlic with extra sauce.   Great taste and loads of garlic.  The cheese cakes are thick and rich.  Hard to choose just 1 with so many temping choices."
Michael N.,"Orlando, FL",2,73,28,1.0,7/22/2016,"Had a horrible experience yesterday night.i called 10 minutes before the closing time to order 2 tiramisu. In 10 minutes my husband was there to pick it   took another 15 minutes to put 2 deserts in to go containers and hung it to him. Really? 25 minutes for to carry out order with deserts only?? The stuff was joking around, talking to each other and taking there time When we came home, I tasted it and it was awful.either expired or it was sitting outside the fridge-room temperature, horrible flavor I called back and Brain the manager assisted me. He said I can come back and exchange it. When I was there, people by to go stand didn't know anything about me coming back (bad management I guess-didn't even asked my phone number, didn't stop by to make sure everything is ok, didn't even inform his employees that I'm on the way back to exchange those deserts), but they took the tiramisu back... I took a few cheesecakes instead. And guess what?one of them had a hair or plastic on the back side. I feel like throw up The picture is attached below P.S. I did contact you on your web site.but haven't received any respond.  Very disappointed with the business. I will never be back"
Stacey C.,"Nashville, TN",0,40,1,1.0,8/24/2017,What an epic failure! From not bringing us a simple Bread Basket to completely screwing up orders from Sliders looking like they came from McDonald's. I'm a huge fan of this restaurant and I don't know what happened tonight Mercury must be in retrograde. Or maybe just the Orlando location of the Cheesecake Factory is too busy with the tourists and doesn't care about local people.
Linet A.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",472,6,,1.0,9/6/2017,"This is one of the worse experience ever!!! Service was slow. I ordered my apps and food my main dish came out before my apps . When my apps finally showed my they were cold no one came to check up on our table.., I don't recommend this place."
Akash J.,"Wesley Chapel, FL",0,19,,1.0,12/16/2016,"Went here on Wednesday for my son birthday. About 3-4 hours later my entire family got sick. We got food poisoning from this place. Totally unacceptable. Had to go to the Doctor , check out from our hotel a day earlier to go back home. I will never go back to this location."
Yemi ..,"Washington, DC",0,78,6,2.0,8/14/2016,"Not sure what is going on with Cheesecake Factory these days. Good service, but the food had no taste. I had the Jamaican black shrimp. The rice was bland. I am giving 2 stars because of the appetizer; strawberry shortcake."
Andrea S.,"Hercules, CA",0,7,,3.0,3/28/2017,"Jonathan Amador saved the day. If it hadn't been for his excellent service and the management team, this review would be about the terrible service we received upon walking inside. We were not greeted by the hostess. She never smiled and barely spoke out loud. However Jonathan was personable and professional. I spoke with a site manager who was also professional and concerned about his staff. I believe that after pointing out my only concern that all future visits will be A+!"
Rachel J.,"Gotha, FL",16,183,176,5.0,6/8/2016,The server we got (Mike) was so nice. The food is great... We took his suggestions & tried the Factory Nachos... Super delish & MASSIVE - easily could split that multiple directions. The service was very prompt & he remembered specifications we had. Great service!
Pamela J.,"NoHo, Manhattan, NY",76,727,604,4.0,11/25/2014,"Oh you know I love the Cheesecake Factory - simply love it and this location is a stunner in a great mall! Tried the new appetizer of fried vegetables - it included zucchini, avocados and mushrooms.  I loved trying a fried avocado but the other fried items soon got to be too much for me to enjoy. We had one of my favorite stand-bys of grilled artichoke.  It was so good, we definitely considered ordering a second.  We didn't and went straight for the pastas.  We both got gluten free and both were awesome.  Whatever GF pasta they use is great and you can not tell any difference. I actually did not have my vanilla bean cheesecake slice and instead drank up a storm of chardonnay. I love the Cheesecake Factory.  Love them.  Thank you for existing."
Kevin N.,"Orlando, FL",69,89,191,2.0,7/19/2015,"I must say, I try to avoid dining at The Cheesecake Factory at all costs. It's basically overpriced fast food with mediocre table service and ""free"" bread. Their motto is quantity over quality due to the shear volume of customers that dine there. But today was my cousins' birthday so I had to attend... I was in the mood for something bland and lifeless, so I ordered the Crab Hash. It was perfectly executed (in terms of being bland/lifeless) with a side of undercooked potatoes. In an attempt to add some type of flavor, they drizzled a weak hollandaise sauce over the Crab Hash, but failed miserably. Not even Tabasco sauce can save this dish from the pain and suffering it endured. The servers' attitude certainly didn't help either. It's not The Cheesecake Factory's fault though because much of this was expected."
Kristi B.,"Savannah, GA",30,57,44,5.0,12/11/2016,Gotta love the extensive menu at Cheesecake Factory.  This particular location is always busier than most locations and our server was great.
Chenae C.,"Davie, FL",0,22,5,1.0,1/19/2017,"So I really hate leaving bad reviews and honestly it takes a lot but this one was necessary. I love cheesecake factory but this location was absolutely awful. I placed a to go order because I was staying at a resort near this location in Orlando. I ordered the hibachi steak dinner which I frequently get it. My friend is the one who picked it up and brought it to me. She checked the food to make sure the steak was cooked at temperature with the person who put the meal together and everything looked good. Unfortunately my friend didn't know what was supposed to come with the meal and the prep person said nothing either. When it got to me the meal was missing the vegetable and the onions that are cooked with the steak which are my favorite part. It was literally just steak on a bed of beans sprouts in mashed potatoes. We were about 20 minutes from the location and also the restaurant had closed but I called the next morning and told him what happened this was Friday, January 13. A manager I spoke with took down my information and said they would give me a call back. I told him I just wanted my order made again and was still told I'd get a call back. Fast forward to Tuesday and I still have not heard back so I called again and at this point I'm back at home so I'm nowhere near this cheesecake factory I speak to a manager again and ask for them to just put it on a gift card or back on my card and I'm told someone will call me back so they can figure out what who handled my call initially it what went wrong (why I hadn't heard back). It is now Friday and I still haven't received a call back so now I've paid for food that wasn't made correctly and I am out of my money with no care from Cheesecake Factory.  I know this is not every location but this is this locations actions specifically. I took every route to handle the matter simply but now will have to reach out to corporate and will no longer dine here. I hope no one else has this experience good luck"
