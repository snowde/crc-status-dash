Bryce S.,"Tucson, AZ",0,3,,5.0,10/24/2017,Went in and ask to watch the World Series and sat there thru 2 innings and bartender still didn't change channel.  I left I believe in 2nd chances... in this case 3. My hotel is near by and this is my place of choice due to the selection of menu. That first time was a disappointment however have come back twice now and service and food have been great.  And they had they've had the World Series on! :)
Katie H.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",11,13,,4.0,8/13/2017,"This location never empty, always busy. I love their bread, warm and fresh. Good portion, good price and friendly service.  Don't forget to get the cheesecake!"
Nellie C.,"Overland Park, KS",232,141,335,5.0,8/11/2017,"First of all....we found a non-bar in Overland Park, that stays open til midnight?! #stillshocked #butfirst #CHEESECAKE The hubs and I first endulged in our cheesecakes, then we got an entrée and I got an appie. It was totally still popppin' off and the weather was great, so the outside seating was full too. I love seeing people out at nite. (Heart of a city girl.)  If we went to a bar, then we only would've gotten deep fried something and, forget about dessert (a statement that would never actually come out of my mouth! Hah! Pun intended)  Needless to say, it was so great to still have kind and speedy service, despite the crowd and time of nite."
Dina R.,"Kansas City, KS",98,90,213,3.0,5/21/2017,"The Drinks are always fenomenal here.  I would really recommend there Mojitos - super Refreshing. I also tried there Long Island and it was super strong - great drink.   Am not too crazy about their food it's a Hit and Miss for me, Sometimes you get Good food others Ok food.  Drinks and Desserts are always fantastic only reason why I keep coming back !"
Angie H.,"Wichita, KS",21,101,89,5.0,6/24/2017,"This is and has for years been in my top 5 places to eat.  Unfortunately (or fortunately, for my waist line) we don't have one in Wichita, so I have to wait until we are in KC or Vegas to eat here.  I prefer this location over the Plaza one simply because it's easier to access and seems to have a quicker turnaround. The problem with the huge menu where everything sounds delicious is that because I so rarely get to eat here, I have to order the meal that put this place in my top 1% in the first place...the Chicken Picatta.  (I just got goosebumps typing that...cue the drool cup).  Yeah...it's a major cheat meal for this gluten-intolerant gut of mine...but soooo worth it!.   I did one time order something gluten free which has now become my hubby's go-to after he tried mine.  That's the Steak Diane...it's pretty damn drool-worthy itself.   We always get a couple of different cheesecakes as well...one to share and one to take with us.  This time we had one of our trusty regulars, the Banana Cream...it's not as rich as some, so we can actually finish it in one setting.  Then we took a new choice, Chris's Outrageous with us...if you like Mounds candy bars or German chocolate cake, this one will tickle your fancy.  Can you really go wrong with any cheesecake that has some combo of chocolate, caramel, peanut butter, or chunks of some candy bar?  Me thinks not."
Kyle A.,"Springfield, MO",66,218,239,5.0,8/22/2017,"Really great food and service. I had the Parmesan chicken sandwich and salad with vine-gret dressing and both were outstanding. The sand which was on a fluffy yet crispy roll and they gave extra red sauce to dip it in. A couple of different types of bread as appetizers.  The cheesecake - I was told - was outstanding. Three different kinds at my table including red velvet, lime and regular. Just a great place with a pleasing interior."
Derry G.,"Higginsville, MO",48,33,77,3.0,12/14/2017,"The service was excellent as we were promptly seated. The waitress was superb and attentive to our needs. The pasta seem not cooked enough but the fish tacos were good as well as the lettuce wraps. Enjoyed the ambiance of the restaurant, but was loud. Overall I think the restaurant is overpriced."
Susan B.,"Leawood, KS",29,76,66,5.0,11/16/2017,"Okay I still have a bit of an issue giving it 5 stars because the cheesecake was almost $10, but overall it was a good value. We ordered two pasta dishes that were on special and my ex ordered his spicy. Both were awesome and we had enough for another meal that night. We split the Oreo cheesecake and ate it over two days. It was decadent. The service was professional and pleasant and the establishment was clean. I'd recommend and can't wait to return"
Shawn H.,"Kansas City, MO",64,290,32,2.0,7/25/2017,"I used to love this place. One of the few chains that really was good. Now the thirty page menu is nothing more then chicken dishes in various forms. They've been Houlihan'd. No place overuses chicken like Houlihan's, now Cheesecake Factory rivals them. You can see how well this strategy has worked for Houlihan's. The menu is a page after laminated page of soulless beige dishes. Nearly all of their signature dishes are chicken unless you added some shrimp. Portions used to be enough for three meals. Not anymore. This is a one setting dish now. This place isn't cheap. For the portion size they presently serve it is way overpriced. I know money is the common denominator but I urge Cheesecake management to remember what made them popular because if they don't I see signs of their inevitable decline. In five years they could easily go the way of Red Lobster or worse."
Rebecca B.,"Shawnee, KS",0,6,,2.0,1/10/2018,"This place use to be great when it first opened but in the last 5 years they have gone down in service. For what ever reason they don't seem to like people who do curb side or carry out orders. It always takes 5 to 10 mins just to place the order, that's how long I end up holding for a server just to place my order. Today I waited approx. 5 mins to place an order for an appetizer, only to be told it would take 20 mins to get ready. It was 2:30 in the afternoon but I thought maybe they had a late lunch crowd. I got there in 20 mins only to find the restaurant practically empty. My cheesecake was sitting out on the counter, I don't know how long it was sitting out but my food still wasn't ready. When I got home (15 min drive) the food was already cold, not luke warm but COLD. I question whether it actually took 20 mins to make since they were fried eggrolls. I use to eat at this place once a week but I got tired of the bad service. Its been a year and it looks like nothing has changed."
Julie D.,"Wichita, KS",20,74,209,4.0,8/17/2017,"I usually always have a good experience here! The only thing I would say is that it gets super busy on some days and they don't take reservations. I ordered the bang bang shrimp and chicken.. It tasted like a curry flavor to me, but still good! Just not what I was expecting what the usual ""bang bang shrimp"" to taste like. We also ordered Korean cauliflower to eat and it's a good replacement for meat! I loved how it tasted with ranch. My friend ordered honey truffle chicken and it was delicious! The chicken was very flavorful. And of course we ordered cheesecake togo... The white chocolate rasberry truffle & mango key lime coconut. Very satisfied with how everything tasted!"
Kay L.,"Overland Park, KS",289,713,91,3.0,4/27/2017,"You come here for the dessert menu.  The white chocolate raspberry cheesecake is my personal fave.  Lots to choose from, all of it delicious. Everything else is pretty uninspired.  On my last visit, my chicken-mango-avocado salad featured little chunks of rock-hard underripe mango, an overcooked stringy piece of chicken, and a vinaigrette that was so tart it was actually painful to eat.  They also told us that the first part of our party hadn't arrived, just before we spotted them sitting at a large table.  (They don't take reservations, so you have to send advance scouts for a large lunch group.)  Service at lunch was painfully slow & disorganized.  Not in a hurry to go back."
Aby V.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,10,6,4.0,9/16/2017,Awsome food like the taste but wait time was bit much .loved the ambience and cocktail
Katrina B.,"Kansas City, MO",0,18,16,3.0,4/28/2017,"I haven't been here before. My husband and I came to celebrate my birthday/our anniversary and use a gift card I had received.  Wait time wasn't bad for a Friday night - and they got us in much quicker than estimated. The hostess wasn't super friendly, but also not chilly. I get it, it was super busy and she has a hard job with (probably) no tip-out.  Our server was really nice, very attentive, answered all of our questions, and brought us a little hot fudge sundae to celebrate. The food was good, but not fantastic. However, the lettuce wraps were amazing. Giving a three because I just wasn't wowed, was pretty loud, and felt cramped. It's a tad pricy, though the serving sizes are big."
Bryenn L.,"Kansas City, MO",48,92,276,4.0,6/10/2016,"I prefer this location over the plaza location, especially for weekend dinners (the wait is out the door on the plaza then).  I've always had a pleasant experience here and the marble interior with high-ceiling and pillars are a nice touch.  They have their lunch specials every day until 5 p.m. I will say, the menu reads like a chapter book with ads separating the genres of food they offer. So if you're indecisive, tell the waiter you'll need more than a minute. On top of that, they have plenty of awesome dishes to choose from, which doesn't make the process any easier.  I've found that all the pastas, have had them all, are fantastic. My favorite pasta is the Carbonara and Da Vinci.  If you're feeling adventurous, you can have your dessert before your meal. As you walk into the place, they have their cheesecake bar on the right side, before you're greeted by their front-end staff. My favorite cheesecake they offer, currently have 60+ cheesecake flavors and always adding/substituting, is the Banana Cheesecake. It's a cheesecake with a hint of banana flavor with whip cream and fresh bananas cut on top of the cream. So good. If you don't see your favorite cheesecake on there anymore, you should ask to see if they still offer it.  For the quality of the food and immense choices, the price is very reasonable. I usually spend around $55-60 for a date night, with big meals, dessert and an occasional appetizer + tip."
Marc M.,"Overland Park, KS",5,72,25,5.0,1/7/2017,The Tuscan chicken was phenomenal. My wife had the grilled chicken Asian salad and that was good too -- it became truly great after our server suggested the Chinese plum dressing.  Great food and service. Good for families with smaller kids too. The server we had (Brad) is one of the best we have had anywhere in the country.
Renata B.,"Kansas City, KS",59,38,77,5.0,1/1/2017,"We love this place! The ""chicken and biscuits"" is delicious and comfy. The artichoke and crab dip omg soooo good! Hubby got mac n cheese burger he said it was delicious!"
Tim S.,"Olathe, KS",39,244,2014,4.0,7/4/2017,"I have been here once and it was many years ago it was okay but it didn't appeal to me and I haven't been back , people like this place and it's busy too so that must be good, might go in on there cheesecake half price special, it's easy to get in and out of the place, so I really can't give u answer if it good or not on this place"
Pretty P.,"Saint Louis, MO",0,6,3,1.0,8/1/2017,"Emotionally unstable and forgetful staff.   One woman had trouble taking a basic order (didn't seem to be able to add and subtract).  An overload of tension in the environment, and the manager himself wasn't familiar with the menu."
Cynthia H.,"Kansas City, MO",8,36,1,1.0,4/7/2017,"First impression: the tile path leading to the door has several broken, missing and loose pieces. I'm surprised someone hasn't fallen.  They were strangely busy for a Thursday night, about a 15 minute wait. Finally the hostess called our name and we get to our table and its still being cleared. Then we sat down to a wet table. Not a good start.  The burger I ordered was good and cooked to order. My date got the fish and it was horrible. We put it aside and shared my plate. Service was bare minimum.  I love this place but I do NOT recommend this location."
Kori W.,"Bella Vista, AR",0,1,,1.0,12/9/2017,"This has been the worst experience we have ever experienced. The host station has told our large group that we would be seated in less than 2 hours. We were not seated until we had waited for over 3 hours and when we stated that we could be split up they told us ""no, we don't like doing that"". The organization and courtesy is lacking to say the least. Members of our group have been told to stop going to the restroom. And when we asked why we couldn't be seated at empty tables, we were told that they are waiting for another group to leave before we could be seated. Doesn't make sense.  Very disappointed. Never will I return."
A D.,"Leawood, KS",22,127,47,1.0,8/12/2017,"After being seated at a table with no utensils. The hostess grabbed some and threw them on the table saying here ya go. I was waiting for the bf to grab a jacket because it was chilly and was asked by the waitress our drink orders. I eat here quite often but it's usually to go. Which is what I should have stuck with. I ordered a appetizer salad. That came out in a chilled bowl which was probably the highlight of my meal. After placing our order for the main course we sat for roughly 25 min and was then told that my order( ahi tuna) wasn't in stock. Well that's great but now his food is up and I have nothing to eat. ON MY BIRTHDAY! Great the one time I decided to eat in the only thing the offer is an apology and the meal on them. Honestly it left the worst taste in my mouth because it was the lack of care. The manager only had a cavalier attitude and a ugh so what approach to fixing the problem. Now it's 15 min before midnight with nothing else open in the area. My thought is if they was cooking orders together this would have had been figured out well before that steak had time to cook. We came together, to eat together, and drink together. Which the waitress decided to bring my Arnold palmer once his food was done. By that time I had already got to the level of pisstivity that I couldn't drink it. I AM OFFICIALLY DONE WITH THIS CHAIN TOGETHER. Neither location can seem to get it right and I have spent way to much money, time, and patience in this place. A hour to get ready and left have only eaten a salad and water. Great birthday celebration. Thanks a lot"
Gary K.,"Mission, KS",12,9,4,2.0,9/27/2017,"Used to be known for huge servings at a fair price.  My wife and I ate there yesterday (9/26) and my Teriyaki chicken was $17.50 for a breast of chicken and a little rice.  My wife ordered a chicken guacamole sandwich and it was $14.50.  Expensive for what you are getting.  Next time we are going to J. Alexanders for lunch - better food, bigger portions, same price."
Ryan S.,"Raymore, MO",0,8,,3.0,4/4/2017,"It's the Cheesecake Factory. If you've been to one, you've pretty much been to all of them.  Food was on par, and service has always been good at this location.  They have a large menu so there's usually always something for everyone.  Lets be honest, I don't go to TCF for the food, it's for the cheesecake. I will be back."
Paul M.,"Overland Park, KS",260,195,35,2.0,1/15/2017,Nice decor and food is okay but it doesn't equal the price they charge.  Anyplace that charges $18 for meat loaf ought to be able to get my order right the first time.
Greg C.,"Kansas City, MO",79,17,22,4.0,8/17/2016,My favorite Cheesecake Factory location. Great food and service. I've had Taylor as a waiter several times and he is amazing. This would be a lock 5***** but the hostess is awful! Rude the last three times and I've got out of my way to treat her as a customer and it just gets worse.  The avocado egg rolls are crazy! Cheers
Whitney M.,"Lawrence, KS",3,6,,1.0,9/23/2017,"The waitress was very slow to get to our order, she couldn't hear anything we were saying and asked us to repeat ourselves after everything we said. She seemed offended when asked if I could sub the soup of the day with the white chicken chili on the soup and salad special, she didn't even go check the kitchen to see if I could. She side salad was awful! It was just greens and dressing. My salad had no cucumbers or tomatos. Our waitress never came by to check on us during our meal. When she finally did come back to collect plates I complained about the salad. She told me I should of told her and she would of subbed it out. Whatever....okay...then the check came and she said she couldn't take off the salads because they were a part of the meal. She didn't tell her manager that we had an issue with the food. Bad service, poor food and totally overpriced. They need less wait times for food."
Cindy F.,"Overland Park, KS",81,226,115,4.0,12/17/2016,"Gave CF another try with a gift card I had received. Went during their Happy Hour, which I had never done before. Was seated in a quiet booth with just a short wait. Was pleased to see Mark West Pinot noir as a $5 HH wine option. Had the spring rolls as a HH app, were very good. Had lots of veggies like bean sprouts and mushrooms, liked the soy and peanut sauce for dipping. I once again wanted the tuna tataki salad, but they were out of tuna. (There is a theme here.) Had the Thai salmon instead, very large portion of fish and was well cooked. Hubby had the shepherds pie, and we took a slice of lemon meringue cheesecake to go. As always, their cheesecake is the best. Service was wonderful. I will be back."
Jon S.,"Topeka, KS",1,34,2,4.0,1/15/2017,"I have visited this location several times and have never been disappointed.  Great for lunch and, of course, for dinner.  The Miso Salmon is to die for. Interestingly - I have never had their cheesecake... so I defer to others for a review of that."
S L.,"Lenexa, KS",0,9,,2.0,3/24/2017,"I got hung up on! It was my boyfriend and I anniversary called to see the wait and to get a name in ,the lady that picked up- "" we seat upon arrival first come first serve "" * click* she hung up on me needless to say didn't go there for dinner. Amazing food in the past but for 20$ plates they need to hire people that don't hang up on customers"
Summer C.,"Bentonville, AR",992,1005,3062,5.0,4/8/2015,"I just feel like it is hard to go wrong with Cheesecake Factory. There are so many options, your whole party will find something to eat. I've never had a bad experience with any of the dishes I have ordered at the Cheesecake Factory.  My family and I made a weekend trip to Kansas City and we came here. We knew we wanted to come here, since we use to live in CA near a few cheesecake factories and then moved to AR with no cheesecake factories. We were really excited to come eat! WAIT/PARKING: We came on a Saturday evening around 6ish. It was really crowded, but we didn't have too long of a wait fortunately. About 30 minutes.  The restaurant is located in a small shopping center. There is a decent amount of parking, but it is a busy restaurant, so parking can be hard to find. We had to park near Whole Foods, which is in the back of cheesecake - not far. CUSTOMER SERVICE: Our waiter gave us great customer service. Very friendly and helpful. FOOD: I've ordered quite a few dishes at Cheesecake Factory. Lately, I've mainly been ordering off of the skinnylicious menu. Can't beat yummy and healthy! I've had several items off of this menu and they have all been delicious and filling. This trip I ordered the Asian Chicken Salad. So yummy, ate it all! It was a large portion too. Which, btw, all of cheesecake factory dishes are good size portions. Usually you will have left overs.  My husband ordered the Italian Sandwich and loved it.  We had our 2 year old daughter with us. At all restaurant locations they bring out a smaller plate of fruit and bread to you if you have a small child. Not sure whicha age is the cut off for that. It is such a nice gesture and I appreciate them taking that extra step to treat the kids good and help the parents out ;). Then we ordered cheesecake... I mean c'mon, how can you pass it up when dining here! I've had a good amount of cheesecakes here and they are all yummy. This time I ordered the Hershey's Cheesecake - oh my yum! My husband had the Reese's Peanut Buttercup Chocolate Cheesecake- also very delicious. We had leftovers from our cheesecakes. Very delicious, but both rich that we weren't able to finish them. However, I finished mine later for my ""4th"" meal haha.  Other cheesecakes I love: fresh strawberry, s'more, 30th anniversary, godiva, raspberry, peanut butter cup fudge, and chocolate mousse. I also love the linda's fudge cake and lemoncello cream torte."
Catherine H.,"Excelsior Springs, MO",3,9,3,1.0,3/12/2017,"Watch your bill here!!!!!  Waitress brought me wrong credit card receipt to sign.  When I caught it,  no apology.  It is a scam that is running at this restaurant.  If it had been a mistake, most restaurants offer a free dessert or something.  They have a very smooth scam going here.  Beware!"
Lauren H.,"Olathe, KS",44,25,,4.0,8/13/2016,"First: we had a great waiter the other day. He was friendly, respectful, and suggested his favorite blend of tea. My mom loves tea more than most people can conceptualize, and she was very impressed. She requested that I add this review.  Second: Oh, Cheesecake Factory. If only I could live my dreams and eat your cheesecake for breakfast everyday. There's nothing like rolling out of bed and enjoying a slice of key lime cheesecake while dancing in your kitchen, preferably at the counter closest to your refrigerator. It's divine. You've been there to celebrate birthdays, births, divorces, and everything in between. You remain a constant. I'm sure this is the new Red Lobster of single 20-30 something females, but you never judge. Keep that brown bread and cheesecake coming, and everything will be just fine."
Beth W.,"Waynesville, MO",59,11,11,4.0,10/15/2016,"We have ate here several times and have always received great service.  Hubs always has the fish and chips.  I try something different every time.  There must be 200 items on the menu!  Oh course cheese cake is always purchased.  This time I tried the mango-lime cheesecake....oh my!  I believe that will be what I order EVERY time!!! Try and dine around 4pm, no waiting!!"
Michelle L.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,4,,4.0,11/27/2016,"Being a fan of the ahi tuna, I ordered the small plate. It was very savory and did not disappoint. I would however be cautious about ordering appetizers. The Firecracker Salmon only cost a little less than an entree, but what I got was a large plate, half of which was covered in red cabbage, the other half with 4 wimpy little spring rolls swimming in sauce. Scarcely more than a bite each for a party of 4.  The Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp was delicious, though the amount of chicken and shrimp seems to be have decreased somewhat. Louisiana Chicken Pasta was ordered from the lunch special, and was also quite good and not overly salty! Definitely don't come here if you're calorie conscious. However Cheesecake Factory as a chain has consistent quality to its dishes."
Emily B.,"Olathe, KS",0,10,,3.0,8/7/2016,"Had lunch there today, it was alright.  My husband and I noticed that the knives, a napkin, and one of the appetizer plates on the table were obviously filthy, so we had to ask for clean replacements right off the bat when we sat down. A short note - they have tons of dishes to choose from, so unless you're a regular or you absolutely love a very specific dish, be prepared to search through a huge (approx. 20 pages) menu. We ordered the (pork?) potsticker dumplings; those were pretty good.  I ordered their 'Factory Burger' for my main meal, and quite frankly, I was disappointed with what I got.  The bread was hard and tough to bite through (unlike the appetizer bread), the onions on the bottom were sort of sad-looking, and while the meat was cooked as ordered, the meal itself didn't come out very hot (unlike the plate).  In hindsight, I should've ordered what my husband had, the 'Bacon-Bacon' burger.  That looked a lot more satisfactory, to be honest. The portion sizes are pretty big, so if you choose to order dessert afterwards, I suggest you get it to-go.  I ordered the Mango Key Lime cheesecake, which tasted lovely (but I do wish they'd cut back on the coconut a little bit).  However, for what it's worth, the prices for just about everything on the menu are...too pricey.  An appetizer (some running about $7-$9) here could get you an -entire meal- elsewhere. As far as service goes, it was decent.  Nothing particularly outstanding or terrible. In short, avoid the 'Factory Burger', it's a total rip-off.  As a whole, the restaurant is a nice treat...once in a while, when you've got the -extra money- to splurge.  It's on the (much?) more expensive end for casual restaurants."
Jamie A.,"Lawrence, KS",1,33,85,4.0,10/12/2016,4.5 stars. Going to the Cheesecake Factory is always a treat. Best Fettuccine Alfredo I've had in months! I got the Snickers Bar Chunks & Cheesecake and ate every bite. The fried macaroni and cheese is a great appetizer. I had almost forgotten just how awesome this place is.
Dianne P.,"Lee's Summit, MO",2,10,,5.0,4/27/2017,Cheesecake Factory never fails to satisfy.  You will always find something to suit your craving.  Their Skinnylicious menu is wonderful!  And I've never had a dessert that wasn't fabulous!
James M.,"Overland Park, KS",8,106,8,3.0,1/12/2017,I DO NOT get it?! People love this place! No clue why people love it. It is OK but not great. I guess if you are rating on cheesecake maybe?! Giant menu that is really just chicken done 50 different ways. This may just be me but I am not going out to eat chicken breast I can do that at home. Most people like this place I think its average at best. Priced too high for what it is but that location and building jack the price up lol! People will probably all not agree with me so sorry
Richard C.,"Saint Joseph, MO",23,3,,2.0,3/28/2017,Terribly small chicken enchiladas. The red sauce tasted like burnt barbecue. The beans and rice was good. I left the restaurant hungry. I won't order that plate again.
