Christyn K.,"Kansas City, MO",259,481,234,4.0,1/1/2012,"Went here for a birthday with 20 of my closest friends. Called a few days ahead of time to make sure we could all get seated within a reasonable amount of time after my guests arrived. ""We don't take reservations, but come an hour early,"" the hostess said, ""and if someone if here for your party the whole time, we will have you ready to go come 6:30."" So, I dropped my husband off an hour early and left to run some errands, only to get a phone call from him minutes later saying that our name is on the list but they don't need us to be there. So I turned around to get him but stayed behind just in case. Long story short - my whole party had arrived by 6:30 but we stood in a poorly lit foyer for another 30 minutes before they would seat us. And not even seat us all - though when we got there the hostess admitted that one of our 5 tables wasn't ready yet so some of my guests would have to stand while we physically waited for a table of two to get the hint that they had been there too long. My husband finally had the nerve that the staff didn't and to asked the couple to leave. I love Cheesecake Factory. I LOVE it. However, I was pretty bummed that we were given the short end of the stick considering that we were worth 10 of those tables of two. Next time I have a large group I am going somewhere where I know we will be treated like a priority."
Ganesh S.,"Olathe, KS",0,20,15,5.0,2/6/2012,"Went here as a part of a group whose anniversary fall on the same date. There were about 14 of us with a mixed of vegetarians and non-vegetarians.  Our waiter was extremely friendly and told us all about the menu and which had meat products and which did not, even the vegetarian looking entree's had chicken broth in them. So she clearly steered us in the right direction.  All in our group was extremely impressed with the level of service we received.  The menu offers a wide variety, a little bit of everything for everyone. We ordered the Bang-Bang Chicken and Shrimp and my wife for the Thai Chicken Pasta. Yummy! It was so filling, we have to take half of it home, we also ordered the Tiramisu cake, delicious!  Restaurant was packed on a Friday night as it was expected, they had a pretty good waiting lounge."
Bloss C.,"Jersey City, NJ",731,1014,2378,4.0,6/27/2012,"I have heard about the Cheese Cake Factory for a while..... finally got to see what all the hype is about.  The location I went to was huge, reminded me of a casino restaurant in Vegas in terms of décor and size.  There was a 15 minute wait, but that wasn't too bad because they give you a pager thing.  Explored the cheesecake selection at the take away counter while I waited, lots of variety, but they all looked too sweet.  Our waiter Craig was supper nice, professional, and courteous.  I was impressed with the service.  I was also impressed with the food.  They have EVERYTHING on their menu.  In fact, they even have 2 menus, regular and the SkinnyLicious.  I ordered off the skinny menu, a mojito, Farro salad (Farro, Cucumbers, Tomatoes, Beets, Red Onion, Feta Cheese and Tzatziki. Tossed with Vinaigrette), grilled artichoke, and split a flatbread (Garlic, Shallots and Fresh Herbs) with my friend.  Everything was good.  I least enjoyed the faro salad, next time I think I'd order the mediterranean salad  which has the same flavors minus the faro.  The artichoke was boiled to cook it and then grilled, which gave it a nice smokey flavor.  It was served with a balsamic vinaigrette instead of the traditional butter aioli, which was ok.  Loved the flatbread, but even with two other dishes, I do not recommend sharing at as you will want all six incredibly small pieces for yourself.  My total bill was $23 before tip= AWESOME!"
Lisa Y.,"Overland Park, KS",0,5,1,5.0,3/17/2014,"Ate here today for lunch and the food was divine!! Boyfriend got the barbecue salmon and I had Evelyn's favorite pasta which was a vegetarian pasta. Had the strawberry cheesecake for desert. Everything was so delicious. Our server was so friendly too, will definitely come back another time."
Gordon A.,"Lenexa, KS",0,1,,1.0,8/23/2015,"Ate here tonight and was greatly disappointed with the service. Server had no people skills. Actually had no server skills either. She left dirty plates on our table, acted like she was doing us a favor. Bill was over $100 and the service was less than fast food."
L A.,"Raymore, MO",0,2,,3.0,8/22/2015,"My family just left this location, we ate dinner this evening on the patio. We have eaten here many times and always been fairly satisfied, however this evening was an awful experience. We were there to celebrate a birthday, and I feel bad for my sister in law that she had to endure that as her birthday dinner.  Let me say that the food was fine, other than a very room temperature and soggy salad for my husband. Our waitress, Tanya, was so unfriendly that it was strange. She had to be asked several times for water, kids menus, and drink refills, which we had to flag her down to get. She never checked on us unless someone was waving their arms. She left salad plates and bread plates on the table that was small to begin with, so that my husband finally moved them to a bussing station himself so as not to elbow one to the floor.  What should have been a decent experience was just plain uncomfortable. We were all very frustrated, by the end of dinner, and she took so long to come back, that we left without dessert, which was kind of the part some of us were most looking forward to.  I won't not go back, simply because we probably won't be seated in her section in all likelihood, but if we are I'll ask for a different server."
Patrick S.,"Overland Park, KS",1,41,1,2.0,5/14/2011,"I've been to the Cheesecake Factory a few times before and I generally leave satisfied, despite the ludicrous prices, but tonight was a different story. After looking through the 30 page menu for a good ten minutes, I decided upon the ahi tuna tatiki salad. A few minutes after my waiter took my order, he returned to tell me that they had run out of the ingredients and I would have to choose another dish. No biggie, so I restarted the arduous task of searching through the menu. I decided on a separate pasta dish, but the price was upscaled $5 from the salad I was intending on getting, so I asked my waiter if given the mishap he would be able to discount the difference to make up for it. He said he'd take care of it so I went on with my meal satisfied. Lo and behold, when the check rolled around, no discount had been added. I pointed this out to my waiter and he left for what seemed like thirty minutes to go discuss it with his manager. When he came back he regrettably told me they could not discount the dish, but would be willing to offer me half-off a dessert. I told the waiter I was not interested in dessert and he said there was nothing else they could do, so I took my own discount out of the waiter's tip. It's a shame because the waiter himself was friendly and accommodating, but the management's incessant attempts to nickel and dime their customers is appalling and has driven away a consistent diner tonight."
V. M.,"Leawood, KS",1,59,,3.0,6/27/2012,We started off with a bunch of dirty silverware that looked like they just left it from the last people.  A kind of angry look from the waitress when we asked for some clean stuff almost finished it.  We decided to stay and give it a try anyway. Pasta carbonara was pretty good and service was good as well. Everyone liked their food and had a good time and there were no other disturbances. Overall OK.
C L.,"Olathe, KS",19,160,7,3.0,1/30/2011,"You'll never hear me say, ""Let's go to The Cheesecake Factory!""  However, at a girlfriend's suggestion, we made a visit.   I always dread looking through their menu - a hundred pages of boring eats that they dress up with exotic names or fancy descriptions to entice those that are looking for an ""upscale"" [eye roll] experience. I ordered Miso Salmon.  To my surprise, it was a decent dish.  The fish wasn't over-powered by the glaze and I quite enjoyed the white sauce that surrounded my bed of rice.  I believe the description said it was a miso sauce, but I didn't taste a hint of miso in it.  It really tasted like a beurre blanc.  The snow peas were nice and crisp, though I'd wished there were more than five.  I will say that the salmon was slightly overcooked in one area, which was a turn-off, but I let it slide since they aren't exactly known for their seafood.  Also, there was a disproportionately large amount of rice compared to the size of the fish atop it, and it was some cheap, sad variety of poorly-cooked sogginess.  My friend had a chicken salad sandwich.  She said it was good, but I didn't sample it, as I don't see the appeal in any such entree. Our service was extremely slow, but the server was friendly enough.  Besides, we were there to chatter away and we overstayed our welcome by an hour (not during peak hours, it was after the lunch rush...I'm not rude).  This place is really overpriced for what they have to offer, but at least they have a variety of options.  And the entree I had last week makes me feel better about my inevitable next visit."
Ali C.,"Harrisonville, MO",7,65,3,4.0,2/1/2014,"I prefer this location over the one on the plaza. This one is much nicer and the food is much better. The service has always been great, regardless of how busy they are."
Henry Z.,"Boston, MA",2,112,2,4.0,7/9/2012,This place is great to go if you don't mind spending an ok amount of money. Waiters and waitresses are polite and food usually comes pretty fast. Complimentary bread and butter and a wide variety of entrees to choose from their menu at all times.
JC A.,"Overland Park, KS",0,35,2,4.0,7/23/2011,"Went to Cheesecake with a bad attitude because Figlio was so close to closing the hostess acted like she didn't want to seat us. So with our foul mood, Cheesecake managed to turn our night around. I was anti- Cheesecake because it's a huge chain.  Shame on me they did a great job. Every single person that dealt with us was professional friendly and upbeat.  The hostess, the bartender, our server and a  manager  that stopped by table during the meal, all great.   (And it's not like we complained or told anyone there we were ticked off at another restaurant.)  We showed up, put on waiting list,  Friday night 9pm.  Had drinks at bar, seated in 25 minutes.  Server was friendly and helpful.   Menu is not my cup of tea-too much over flavored salty things BUT I got a simple pasta dish and it was good.  Dining partner had a chicken lemon dish that he practically licked the plate clean. Cheesecake factory not cheap: but the wonderful service and good food make it a very nice evening."
chris b.,"Austin, TX",0,3,,1.0,10/15/2014,"Let me start by saying I have never written a review but had to write this one after our experience. I would have given a 0 out of 5 stars but that is disallowed. I had the mushroom burger which was bland and edible. My wife had the chicken picata which looked good until we found what was either a wire or a bug's leg. I dont know because the server whisked the plate away to show the manager as soon as we alerted her. Either way, it was disgusting and I will never eat there again. I can not in good faith review any other elements of the Cheese Cake Factory as I am tainted by that experience."
Brenna P.,"Kansas City, MO",48,300,85,3.0,10/12/2010,"I stopped in here for brunch around 11 AM with a group of people on a Sunday afternoon.  We were promptly seated and our drinks were served quickly.  I glanced over the menu and quickly realized that it was a bit overwhelming.  I also realized that despite the menu being several pages long, it is somewhat lacking when it comes to vegetarian entrees. I ended up ordering the huevos rancheros.  The eggs came served on two corn tortillas, with fresh avocado, black beans, tomatoes, and salsa.  The dish wasn't exactly up to par in the spice department, so I requested some Tabasco sauce to give it an extra kick.   My girlfriend had the French toast.  I had a few bites of it, and it wasn't really anything special.  In fact, it pretty much tasted like some of the French toast I've prepared at home.  I was really expecting something a little more elaborate. The food I had probably wasn't worth the price tag, but it was good.  Not great, just good.  I didn't partake in any cheesecake, so I can't comment on that aspect of the food experience here.  This is the kind of place I wouldn't likely return to if I chose a place to dine.  However, I wouldn't hesitate to go again and try another dish if someone invited me."
Chinatsu V.,"Lenexa, KS",25,22,5,3.0,12/9/2014,"Usually both food and service are good. But last time we were there, we got a new server (she told us she was new) and we had a not-so good experience. Sure, she was still a new server there, but couldn't they put someone a little bit more trained for our table since we had a young son who is not so patient. We waited for our drinks for 15 mins. Alcohol drink came out before water or my sons juice. My sons food came out next, but didn't get his juice yet. so my son had to eat most of his meal without any drinks. Finally I had to get up and asked another server for our water and juice. Waited another 20mins for our food. My husband ordered his burger medium rare but came out well done. But since my son already finished eating by the time our food came out, we did not ask to remake the burger again. (Didn't want to wait 30 more minutes for another one) I didn't give 1 or 2 stars because I know usually they are good. I wish our server could have some help from other experienced server. Very stressful experience."
Amy C.,"Greenville, IL",17,10,,5.0,9/5/2013,"We love the Cheesecake Factory.  Even though I probably get the same thing every time!  Their bread is fantastic and I always get the fettucine alfredo with chicken.  The lunch portion is huge in my opinion and the dinner portion they might as well roll in a vessel the size of the Titanic.  But I always make sure I leave enough room for cheesecake.  My favorite would have to be the Red Velvet Cheesecake.  The service is usually decent.  Even if we don't have time to eat (because the wait is so long), we always go in to get cheesecake to go!"
Herra H.,"Lenexa, KS",38,17,10,3.0,12/19/2014,"We went here as a large group of 14-15. We had called ahead of time and asked for a reservation and when we got there at the time they told us, they said it was going to be another 45-60 minute wait. We were starving and decided to wait in the lobby. The floor manager wasn't very polite, I understand we were a bunch of students waiting, and we did crowd the lobby a little but she did not have to treat us with such disgust. We didn't mind though, what really set me off was when an elderly man had walked in with his wife, he had made a reservation too,  and she said ""you will have to wait, we accidentally have given your table to someone else"". What is the point of making reservations if you won't even get the table?  To pass the time, some of us went to the whole foods and explored the area. When we came back, we were finally seated but it was so crowded! We were seated in next to the booths. For drinks we had Ordered ""house made lemonade"". The rims of the glasses were coated with sugar and it was very sweet. It tasted like all the flavoring was at the bottom of the glass and the top was water. I had ordered the chicken farfalle pasta. Now originally it comes with pacetta and mushrooms, but I do not eat pork or beef and I hate mushrooms, so I asked if I could have it without them. It took about 20-30 minutes before the food came, we had bread and butter at our table. When we finally got our food, I dug straight in. I first noticed that there were mushrooms in it, i disregarded it. But then as I took and bite, I tasted something strange. They had put pork in my pasta. I immediately started crying and freaking out, considering its against my religion to eat pork, I had gotten the manager, I was teary eyed ,and she brushed me off and called the waitress. I do not think they understood how upset I was. The waitress sent it back. In 10 minutes I had gotten the replacement, however it did not have the same saucy texture and it was piping hot. The food looked okay but my appetite was gone. My friend said however, it was not the best. Considering how over priced it is, the service and the food, we should have went to Olive Garden. However, the cheesecake was DELICIOUS! The one positive. The restaurant itself was Egyptian themed which was interesting. The bathroom was fim and it smelled good, which is weird."
Deana J.,"Belton, MO",303,376,4222,5.0,7/20/2010,"The menu here is extensive, and the representation of various ethnicities, diverse, but, alas, today I am here to experience cheesecake in all it's glory.  For those of you that would mock this establishment as merely a common restaurant chain, I say...don't mock it until you've tried it!  They didn't become a chain for nothin'.  Cheesecake Factory, as the name implies, does cheesecake, and does it well, I might add.  The list of delicious options, just like the entrees, is no less extensive.  Today, my mouth is watering for the Adams chocolate peanut butter cheesecake.  If you, as I, am a peanut butter and chocolate aficionado, then this is the cake for you .  Rich and luscious cheesecake with an in your face peanut butter punch.  This my friend, is not for the faint of heart.  This is dense, soul satisfying, and delicious.  Come, be a believer, and sacrifice your waistline to the cheesecake gods.  Your belly will be glad you did, even if your calorie count will cringe.  I say conquer, pillage, and plunder."
T C.,"Overland Park, KS",0,8,,4.0,9/15/2013,"This one is closer to me so I have come here multiple times. I love the food and the desserts however they can be a bit pricey. I recommend this one, but I haven't been to the one in the Plaza."
Melanie W.,"Garnett, KS",0,6,2,4.0,1/23/2015,"I love the décor and the atmosphere.  Their drink menu is fabulous!  The food, fantastic!"
