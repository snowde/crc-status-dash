Alicia D.,"Floresville, TX",15,34,1,1.0,5/14/2012,"I went in on a busy day, I can understand that, but waiting thirty-five minutes for two slices of cheesecake on any day of the week is unacceptable. The staff was rude, indifferent, or just plain unprofessional and I left seething with irritation (As I am pretty zen, that is actually an impressive feat.). In the event that the experience was not enough to earn them a negative review, when I did get to taste my cheesecake the outer frosting had the distinct taste of butter that has been left unprotected in the refrigerator for too long. I, personally, will never step foot in this restaurant again. Yuck."
Sonja G.,"Chillicothe, MO",192,37,15,3.0,9/2/2012,"Long wait, they said 30 minutes and it was 1 hour 15 minutes.  Felt sorry for our waiter he was waiting on the entire section...poor management at this franchise.  Food was cold when it finally arrived an hour later.  Horrible experience!"
Tester T.,"Overland Park, KS",0,1,,5.0,10/3/2012,Awesome cheesecake; good coffee; attentive waitress remembered our order from 3 months ago!!
Amanda F.,"Kansas City, MO",90,127,13,3.0,1/20/2012,"My overall experiences here are typically pretty good. The servers are very friendly, the food always tasty and the nice variety of the menu is also great. Everyone can find something if you have a big group. This is an incredibly nice location as well."
Samantha M.,"Belton, MO",8,56,,3.0,8/1/2011,"The Cheesecake Factory, king of the chain restaurants. The one thing I like about chain restaurants is that I can rely on items being available (I honestly think that's what their high points are, you know what the expect).  With that said, I went to The Cheesecake Factory Saturday afternoon because it was National Cheesecake Day. I am not one to ignore such a day so I decided to stop by and pick up a slice of cheesecake (the deal they had going was half off a slice of cheesecake/1 per customer).  I decided to go to the bakery counter and get my cheesecake to-go. The girl taking my order was extremely sweet and patient as I decided exactly which cheesecake I wanted to try. I went for the chocolate coconut cream cheesecake....let me tell you it was the most divine piece of cheesecake I have had in a long time. It has a macaroon type crust, tons of coconut and chocolate chunks throughout the cake. I of course could only eat half of it and left the other half for later (I can never finish a slice of cheesecake). So if you're a fan of coconut cream I highly recommend this cheesecake and for those that are rolling their eyes saying ""why don't you just make your own cheesecake instead of supporting a chain"" my answer to you is, if you'd like to spend the $50+ for the ingredients for the cheesecake I make (real honest to goodness NY cheesecake) then by all means please send me a check or money order :)"
Melisa V.,"Leawood, KS",151,504,15,3.0,5/5/2009,"I think the best time to go to The Cheesecake Factory is around 10 p.m. on a weeknight. NO wait.  just grabbed a few late night bites off their small plates menu (and yes, for the record... the small plates here are normal plates elsewhere). the service was also impressive for this time of night. the food was pretty good, but most of the options are either fried or creamy.  I think I've realized that The Cheesecake Factory is just a great happy hour or late night place because the food isn't worth an hour wait otherwise."
Elizabeth N.,"Lawrence, KS",22,307,,1.0,8/6/2011,"A waste of time. The food is pretty expensive already but the quality here is worse than the other locations which makes it feel like you've been slapped when you walk out of there. You already know you're going to overpay, but then they give you crappy food too. I have given it a few tries and it is consistently bad even on the weekend. The food is just not prepared well at all. Crunchy rice, dry meat, chewy shrimp, cold bread- all at the same meal."
Doug H.,"Belton, MO",16,11,,4.0,1/3/2012,"We went for Christmas Eve Dinner 12-2011.  We had a party of 5 and the seated us in the booth tables by the bar.  The chairs were uncomfortable.  It was rather loud, but the surroudings quite attractive.    The food was up to par, as always, and they would have only gotten a 3 star for the food but the Server got them this extra 4th star.  He was wonderful.  He anticipated our needs and was full of laughter.  He could have pulled up a chair and sat down.  We absolutely loved him.  This isn't a normal destination for us as it is always crowded but we will now think of going here more often."
Q L.,"Richmond, VA",16,456,40,2.0,7/28/2011,Ordered a couple of Seared Tuna dishes to go.  Tuna was just sliced too thick. Thicker than any of the other 30 Cheesecake Factories I've been to across the nation.  I don't like my fish gummy.
Aaron G.,"Olathe, KS",61,161,34,4.0,8/5/2009,"I enjoy this particular Cheesecake Factory.  The food here is pretty good and I know my wife prefers it here because of the way they cut the chicken on the Santa Fe Chicken salad (which I highly recommend) as opposed to the one on the Plaza.  The Plaza one thin slices the meat and it just doesn't taste the same.  The one out on 119th is oh so yummy in my tummy.  I've had the Jambalaya and the Crusted Chicken Romano and those are both good too.   I am not really big on their steaks and would never go there for steak.  There are too many other great restaurants for that, but I will say that everything else is pretty good.   The only thing I don't like is the how they have the seating arrangement.  If you want to have more private conversations, make sure you request a booth.  The tables are so close together that you can hear everyone else's conversation and no doubt they can hear yours.  Plus, the waiter's butt usually ends up in your face when the other tables are being served.  Not a good situation if the waiter farts while serving."
Natalie D.,"Winona, MN",25,24,,5.0,2/28/2011,"Great Place! The atmosphere is great for a date, love the lighting! The menu is like 7 pages and there is so much to choose from! The portions are huge! My husband and I always split a meal and most of the time there is still some left from that!! My favorite desserts there are the red velvet cake, the lemoncello, and the peanut butter fudge cake!!! It's always so hard to decide! My husband is not a cheesecake fan so he always gets the black out cake and eats it within minutes!"
B L.,"Overland Park, KS",2,26,,2.0,1/27/2011,"This applies to TCF restaurants in general.  The food is OK.  The food prices are not cheap.  The dessert prices are outrageous.  The menu reads like a boring novel that doesn't end soon enough.  There's not enough private seating available; I'm not into having lunch or dinner bumping elbows with my fellow masticators (get your mind out of the gutter, masticate means to chew)."
Anna H.,"Kansas City, MO",0,21,4,4.0,5/4/2013,"This has been my favorite restaurant since 10 years. Yes, drinks are expensive so I just get coffee or tea, but the food is outstanding. I had California sandwich for breakfast and it was huge! Crab dip is to die for, mushroom flatbread, pastas, Kobe beef burger, Salomon, just everything we had was always delicious and tasty."
Clifford K.,"Wichita, KS",0,3,,1.0,10/25/2013,"Worse call in experience.  I was on hold for over 30 minutes. Staff did not care, no effort was made to expedite my order or compensate the cost. I have been to chain location's all over the country and have never had such an experience."
Amanda T.,"Gardner, KS",63,76,10,5.0,4/11/2011,My husband and I decided to go to Cheesecake Factory to celebrate our 4th anniversary. We are very picky on where we choose to eat. I have ate at Cheesecake Factory a few different times and have always enjoyed the food. I was very impressed with dinner and the service was great. I really enjoyed my time and did not feel rushed. We ordered cheesecake to go and that was also wonderful. I would recommend Cheesecake Factory to anyone.
The Zen Chef N.,"Wichita, KS",0,31,,2.0,5/24/2014,"We love visiting KC, and one of my fav restaurants to revisit is the Cheesecake Factory. But it seems like every revisit, the place seems to have gone downhill on service. Maybe there's better competition based on new experiences elsewhere. We had a birthday in the family, and was eager to have a great enjoyable dinner. We waited about 1 hr for our table, reason was big party of 8. Hence, we see parties of 9-10s that came after us that got seated before us. Then finally, we get a table and the server tells us all the fresh fish is out, even not your frozen cod or whatever fish they use for fish n chips is out. Then after talking to the manager, all of a sudden the delivery truck just delivered fresh fish on a Sunday evening, after we already ordered. Needless to say the food was okay, wasn't worth it all that wait and scarce menu options. Dissappointing to say the least, maybe they should just stick to desserts."
Michelle G.,"Omaha, NE",49,404,2,4.0,5/3/2010,"allright,  Cheesecake factory has added things to thier menu including small plate appetizers and small salads. if anybody every had thier regular salads i deem the ""vat of salad"" enough to serve 6 people as a salad.. could the small plate be perfect size. YES!   this afternoon i lunched on the patio and ordered the balsamic house salad. WOW was it good and i'm really not a dressing fan. i had my standard tex mex eggrolls which were excellent and also a banana cream cheesecake to go.  it was a gorgeous afternoon and i couldnt really think of a better lunch out reading on thier patio.  they have a ton of new dishes through the new menu."
Brad C.,"Overland Park, KS",2,25,,3.0,9/12/2010,"The Cheesecake Factory is very much a love/hate type of restaurant.  I think it lies somewhere in between a VERY upscale Applebee's and the type of mega-sized gourmet restaurant you would see in a Vegas casino. They get points for their diverse menu selection (the menu is a 10+ page book!) and that their food usually tastes fresh.  None of their entrees has ever really ""wowed"" me... except for their cheesecake.  If you go there, you can expect a good meal (but not great) served in a gigantic portion that will almost ensure you will be leaving with leftovers. I will come back and edit this review when I realize exactly why I've never really liked The Cheesecake Factory.  Could be the lack of originality, could be the fact that almost everything on their menu is between 1000 and 2000 calories, or it could just be the fake-feeling atmosphere."
Jennifer B.,"Olathe, KS",0,2,,2.0,7/18/2012,"Don't get the Skinnylicious Asian Chicken Salad, it was awful. Barely any chicken, the flavor wasn't good and it was pricey ($14.50) for basically just lettuce and carrots.  My friends ordered the lettuce wraps ($5.95) and really liked them.  I think they had as much food as I did at half the price.  Speaking of prices, they are a little higher than I expected.  The staff was nice but service was slow.  It was so noisy I could barely hear the person sitting directly across from me.  Too many negatives - I won't be returning."
Jennifer P.,"Olathe, KS",0,18,,4.0,7/9/2013,"So good, love the flavored ice tea.  It's always a favorite and brings the same satisfaction each time.  Chicken Madiera is a favorite."
