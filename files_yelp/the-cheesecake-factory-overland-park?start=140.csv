Kathy G.,"Overland Park, KS",9,1,,1.0,3/21/2013,"Called to place my order in advance, was put on hold twice. Told it would be ready in 20 minutes, I arrived 25 minutes later. Had to wait 10 minutes to pick up the order that was there waiting for me. Only one worker who was taking orders on the phone, taking orders for cheesecakes and supposedly checking out the to go orders. The manager was talking to a co-worker about the cheesecake container for to go orders. Took 10 minutes for someone to come and help take care of the customers. Don't do to go orders there unless you are willing to wait a long time."
Lea K.,"Overland Park, KS",21,107,,3.0,8/12/2010,"If I were to review based only on deserts this place would get 5 stars hands down, no question. Though the menu is huge the vegetarian options are disappointing. They have quite a few dinner salads yet all of them have meat. Though I can order it without the chicken, it bothers me to pay $13 for a salad when I am not getting the meat. The salads should have two prices a price without meat, then an option to add meat for an additional charge. By doing this the vegetarians won't feel 'ripped off'.  I tried the portabella mushroom sandwich. The portabella had a tough skin and wasn't enjoyable at all. The grilled cheese is very good but with a menu like their I shouldn't have to order a grilled cheese. I usually order the Chicken Thai lettuce wraps and sub avocado for the chicken. They are wonderful that way. My main suggestion for the Cheesecake factory is to add tofu to their options. That way, vegetarians can sub the tofu for meat. That would open up the menu greatly."
Tara P.,"Oakland, CA",193,63,99,3.0,11/29/2008,"I don't venture to The Cheesecake Factory often and each time I do actually go, I remind myself why.  The service is fair to poor.  I hate to generalize their wait staff in that way, but the last waiter I had confirmed my feelings about that.  We had several people waiting on our medium sized party (7) and I never truly knew who our waiter was.  We were left to view our menu's for WAY too long.  You would think that they woud get the hint when the conversation at the table turned to, ""Where did our waiter go? and He has been gone so long I have forgotten what he/she looked like.""  Despite the service, the food was good.  I had the lunch salad and pizza.  The salad was big enough to eat by itself, so at least I got another meal out of the pizza.  If you like Starbucks iced green tea, their Sweetened Green Tea is great here too!"
Justin E.,"Raytown, MO",133,273,32,3.0,7/27/2008,Way overpriced for the quality. I don't think I've waited less then 30mins to be seated during dinner time. I really luv their fish taco's (even if I am paying too much for them) but they are the best/freshest in town. Anytime I've ordered Beef or a Red Meat item off the menu I've ended up shitting in my pants on the drive home. I don't know what the chef cooks the meat it but my body doesn't like it. Maybe MSG (man sausage good)
