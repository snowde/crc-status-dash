Anny-Alisa C.,"Manhattan, NY",27,19,87,4.0,8/6/2016,"The food is good and variety but a little bit pricy. However, the portion is big that its shareable if you have small appetite. The cheesecake is the main focus here. You should definitely give it a try"
Bri W.,"Kansas City, MO",0,16,9,5.0,8/9/2016,"The Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake is amazing!! Very rich in flavor!!  Haven't eaten lunch/dinner at this location, only the plaza but hoping to change that in the near future! :)"
Aastha G.,"Overland Park, KS",15,34,25,4.0,9/9/2015,It's a really nice to be if u love cakes especially cheesecakes. It does justice to its name. Lemme first talk about the ambience as it's the first thing you notice. It's built over a huge area and it's Egyptian themed. Very pretty. The staff is well spoken. You will never run out of options as they have a huge menu. But if you are a vegetarian or a vegan better reconsider before going there. I went there with my husband and we ordered avocado egg rolls for starters. They were really really good. For the main course we had a veggie burger and noodles. Finally ending with a delicious tiramisu cheesecake.
Austin H.,"Kansas City, MO",2,6,,3.0,8/1/2017,The survive was not great at all our waiter was very very slow. We had to get up and get her come and clear our table and take our dessert order.
Kylea M.,"Overland Park, KS",18,14,2,4.0,7/20/2017,"The food is always good and they have a lot of choices. The menu is obnoxiously long, like 20 pages or so. Service is sometimes ok but most of the time they are slow and inattentive."
Sarah W.,"Basehor, KS",3,6,2,5.0,7/3/2016,We had lunch here today and it was amazing. Service was prompt and portions were huge. I had the Thai Chicken Lettuce Wraps as my meal and they were amazing. They veggies were fresh and the sauces had great flavor. My husband had the nachos and he loved them. Our waitress was friendly and made sure we had everything we could possibly need.
Dave F.,"Kansas City, MO",2,156,6,3.0,6/16/2017,"Eh. I mean you know what to expect. The Nashville hot chicken was pretty good. The pasta wasn't. The cheesecake is good but the whole thing seems more expensive for what you're really getting. If you're going to go, might as well go to the Plaza though."
M. O.,"Overland Park, KS",80,174,292,3.0,2/12/2016,"Being from a small(er) town, I recall my early experiences with Cheesecake Factory being a BIG DEAL.  When my wife (then-girlfriend) moved to Kansas City from the aforementioned village, nearly every big experience was celebrated with a dinner date out to the Cheesecake Factory on the Country Club Plaza in The Big City.  We gladly suffered through three-hour-and-thirty-minute waits on Saturday night, just to be ""on the Plaza"" and seemingly more awesome than all the pitiful fools we left behind from our misspent (mis-located?) youth. The basics haven't changed in 10 years - nice, clean venues, consistent decor, strong service, enormous menu covering cuisine from all seven continents, and, yes, hunger-pain-inducing long waits on the weekends. My last three visits have all been relatively more of the same, with the exception that each one missed a step in one of the above areas.  On the former two occasions, the food quality had seemingly dropped off a tick. For a decade, I would have rated it 4/5 stars, but it's dropped to 3 - 3.5.  Still strong, especially considering the breadth of menu options the obviously-skilled CF chefs have to be able to create, but down a notch.  Quantity is still enormous, which is to say just fine. On my latest visit, I feel we were slighted on the usual above-average service end of things.  Our waitress was a little more in tune to the pompadour-haired bartender than her waiting duties, both on our table and others'.  You may be thinking, ""But, M.O., you yourself pointed out just how crazy-busy the Cheesecake Factory is!""  Yes, Yelp brethren, while this is normally true, on this occasion it was a mid-winter Thursday evening from 9:00 to 11:00 pm in the bar.  We were but one of three spots in the entire bar area taking up space.  So few tables to tend to should have meant better-than-average service, however we received the opposite.  Nitpicks aside, Cheesecake Factory remains a strong, albeit predictable, choice for a good meal alongside half the metropolitan area.   TIP: Get the cheesecake. Any of them. Obvious, yes, but almost so much so that you might be tempted to eat that entire 14-pound plate of delicious pasta instead of leaving room for dessert.  There's a reason the dessert name made the façade, folks! Food = 3/5  Facility = 4/5 Service = 2/5 Ambiance = 3/5 Value = 4/5"
Denise H.,"Olathe, KS",10,13,18,5.0,12/15/2016,"The team in charge of the Chesecake factory is doing a great job. All clients are welcomed as guests, the menu is simple but of high quality and the team is open to accommodate special needs or wishes. The price is fair and the ambience is pleasant. Only one suggestion: light candles on the tables, it would add something special to an already special restaurant."
Diego C.,"Kingman, KS",4,1,4,1.0,8/14/2016,My girlfriend and I went to go have a nice dinner on Sunday. We've never been to this location we usually go to the plaza. The entrance was dirty the rug was torn. We order water and calamari the calamari arrived before are waters did. The calamari was so greasy when you grabbed it would slide out of your hands. Are waitress went Mia so we left before we even ate won't be back to this location.
CA I.,"San Diego, CA",1,39,48,4.0,7/11/2016,Really friendly and accommodating service - smiles in every direction! The food is classic CF - ginormous and average. It served the purpose with nothing to complain about!
Fredrick G.,"Wichita, KS",42,94,13,4.0,12/5/2015,"Came here for lunch during our most recent visit to the area and were impressed at how fast we were seated, as well as with how often our server came by to check on us. While we initially both ordered burgers, I decided to throw a curveball and order the Fettuccine Alfredo, and the server never missed a beat. When we received our order - completely pleased. For a cold, gray and just genuinely dreary day my meal hit the spot and warmed me up. My wife was pleased with her burger, but stopped early because she wanted a slice of cheesecake. She has a better beat on her priorities than I do since... duh, ""Cheesecake Factory"". I decided to slow down from that point as well. The desserts, of course, you can't lose with. She had a Chocolate Tuxedo Cream Cheesecake while I had the Chocolate Mousse Cheesecake.  Not the cheapest lunch ever, but you actually get great portion sizes for the dollar. We always seek these places out while on the road, as we don't have one in Wichita, but yeah. Still coming off the high from the cheesecake almost a week later."
Amanda W.,"Overland Park, KS",95,210,99,3.0,11/12/2015,"Maybe I don't understand the big hype about this place? I was taking my mom to dinner, I had been here once, she had never been. The place is always busy. Let's face it. Always. This place turns over some insane amount of business. We walked in, and were not at all surprised to find ourselves a 10-15 minute wait. No biggie. We were given a little light up thing, and told to wait. The wait actually was pretty quick before it light up and began vibrating, telling us it was time to sit. We went back to the host stand, they took our light up thing, and then.... We waited. They lost our table (?) - they forgot who we were (?) - we waited almost 10 more minutes, before they finally asked ""What was the name? It'll be a 10-15 minute wait."" Uh... yea, no. I informed them we had waited, and already turned in our light up thing that should have gotten us a coveted seat at the wonderous Factory a la Cheesecake. They did find a table for us. A table, towards a corner of the restaurant, that sat exactly 2 people, and the table left little room for 2 waters, let alone food or bread. But, it was a table. The waitress took about 10 minutes to come to us with waters, another 10 to bring the drinks we ordered.. and the food. Sigh. Mom ordered an omlette - eggs people. 10 minute cook time, max.. I ordered a salad - the tuna tataki salad - RAW... and still, our food took 47 minutes to arrive to our table. I had watched another couple who came in after us, were seated after us, order drinks, an appetizer, their entrees, and 4 slices of cheese cake to go, and they were out.. before we even received our food. The waitress wasn't necessarily a bad server. She was friendly, and kept a smile on her face, even knowing how frustrated we were with the incredibly long wait, and ticket times. I just don't understand how a place like this still doesn't have the kinks worked out to satisfy a busy night? This place is always busy. On the bright side, the food was delicious - I will just definitely be ordering to-go from now on."
Phon S.,"Olathe, KS",174,25,16,4.0,1/19/2016,"Every time I come to this location I'm always greeted immediately by their super friendly hostesses.  The place is always clean and has a very welcoming vibe.   For today's visit.  We weren't dining in.  I was making a quick stop to pickup a 7 inch cheesecake.  I didn't order ahead, but yet they were still super quick and able to accommodate my needs.   Love their red velvet cheesecake and regular fresh strawberry cheesecake."
Tara D.,"Topeka, KS",12,12,,1.0,10/18/2015,"The worst.  Have ate here in the past and it's always been decent but this last time was bad enough that we won't be back. They have changed how they do hamburgers and sandwiches by putting them on ridiculously hard loaf bread.   I ordered the factory burger which consisted of a strip of hamburger, a heap of greasy onions and some barely melted cheese all on some bread that puts you in danger of chipping a tooth.   My husband ordered the Cuban (which he has enjoyed in the past) it also was on hard bread with barely any meat.  We both felt the fries tasted like they had been cooked in really old oil.   Waitress came by like once and made no comment about our not remotely finished plates.   Very frustrating to spend that amount of money on food and realize that we probably could have got ""better"" food at McDonald's- at least there I'm not in danger of breaking a tooth."
Ian P.,"Olathe, KS",12,4,2,5.0,1/23/2017,Great place to get a good meal and unbeatable desert.  Only con is that it is very popular and the wait can be lengthy.  We were fortunate to walk in and get a table for our party size without a wait.  Server was very attentive to our needs and did a great job of taking care of us. Never had a bad meal here.
Matthew C.,"Leawood, KS",58,153,41,5.0,11/11/2015,"The food is not that good, I'll be honest. It's a waste of money, time, and honestly, raw ingredients. I think they just do it to call themselves a restaurant because you can't fill a building with cheesecake and hope to get the crowds they do. Having said that, someone somewhere sold either a first born or part or all of their soul to concoct such a cheesecake. It will make you believe in the devil. Don't try it, or do. I recommend the original straight up, on the rocks. I don't know what that means, but honestly, their original cheesecake is magnificent. It is better than the definition of what cheesecake should be. It's about 7 bucks per slice, and honestly worth every cent. All of their other flavors are great, but gimmicky. The original is life changing. Be careful with this much power. Good day."
Eugene H.,"Olathe, KS",0,4,,4.0,1/19/2017,Probably the best of the big chain resteraunts in the US. People complain about the prices... If you think its expensive just dont buy it lol. You know what you are spending as soon as you order idiots.
Adam S.,"Overland Park, KS",24,193,20,5.0,8/31/2014,"Both of the KC Cheesecake Factories have great food, amazing cheesecake, and attentive waitstaff. I love their Sunday brunch. If you haven't been for brunch, you have to check it out. I got the Monte Cristo last time I went, and it was amazing. I could only eat about half of it. For dinner, I highly recommend the orange chicken.  I've only had one ""bad"" meal at Cheesecake Factory, and our waiter immediately corrected it. On my last visit, my orange chicken came out really dark and smelled burnt. I took a bite, and it had a smokey flavor. I told our waiter, and he sprang into action. He took it, got another one started, and came back to the table. He said he ate a piece and made the chef eat a piece, and they both agreed it was totally unacceptable. He profusely apologized, and without me even asking, he told me he removed it from the check."
Kathleen C.,"Tampa, FL",12,59,150,1.0,10/1/2015,Kitchen is so slow. I waited 45 minutes for my kale and salmon salad. I finally flagged down my waiter and he looked confused. I asked him to pack it up so I could head back to my hotel. Of course no napkins and no plastic fork.  The food was good but I was very disappointed with my experience at this location.
