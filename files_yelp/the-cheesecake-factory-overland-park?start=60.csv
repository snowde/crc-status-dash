Bill L.,"Wichita, KS",27,123,32,5.0,7/29/2015,"As always, flavorful well presented food. Pear entice salad. Nice combination of flavors that include blue cheese, glazed pecans, viegarette. Great service. And of course the cheesecake."
Chris G.,"Kansas City, MO",244,531,54,2.0,2/4/2014,"For today, this review is a solid 2 stars.  If/when we go back, and were to have the same experience, it would drop to a 1 star, based on the food.  The food was 1 star, and the service 3 to 4 stars. When I eat at chains, it's because I have a general idea that the food is going to be decent, and the service will be good. 1 out of 2 this time. My food was 'edible', but nothing that would actually cause you to 'enjoy' your meal. I probably could have sent it back, but I had no hope that the next plate would be any better, and I was 'over' being at Cheesecake Factory.  I hadn't eaten at this one in many years, but the other two I had visited (Plaza, and in Columbus OH) were much better than I had expected, so I had expectations that this one would be good. This visit was 80% less than the other recent visits elsewhere. The server was pretty good, and she kept my water filled, which is no small task.  Although she never did check on my meal satisfaction during the meal, when she cleared my plate, which had half my meal left on it, she showed concern, and offered to get me something else.  I declined, told her thanks, and asked for the check. Sometimes it's just a 'miss'.  Shortly thereafter, a nice young man (the manager, apparently....FT) was at my table, politely asking how my meal was.  I wasn't complaining, but I wasn't going to lie about it: ""Edible"". He asked what was wrong (entree was very tough, might have been overcooked, just....bleh).  He did everything he could to make my experience a good one, although I declined repeatedly. The manager and server were very nice and helpful."
Marie F.,"Eugene, OR",245,374,913,3.0,3/27/2014,Food is just ok. I haven't been too impressed by it. Cuban bites on the small plate menu tastes like cheeseburger rollups.   Cheesecake is delicious!  (but hella pricey -- 8 bucks for a slice) My personal fave is the Lemon Raspberry.  Not too sweet and the layer of real cake combined with the cheesecake makes it fluffy and dense.  Yeah... I don't understand that either.  It's good though.  Promise. I called in my order and they asked me if I needed it delivered to my car.  I figure after consuming about 8 more pieces of cake I will be requiring this service.
Tonya G.,"Kansas City, KS",81,24,43,4.0,4/14/2016,"When you crave a big salad and in the mood for some great deserts, you can't go wrong here."
Carol G.,"Topeka, KS",33,303,486,4.0,5/31/2015,"Not much that I can say that the others haven't said already. It's hard to go wrong because they have such an enormous selection of menu items to choose from.  It's not terribly inexpensive, but the portions are ginormous and they use quality ingredients. I think you get what you pay for here.  Environment is pleasant if not insanely busy but hubby and I did not have trouble having a conversation and we didn't feel like the table next to us had to listen to it.  If you're watching your calorie intake, I suggest you go elsewhere. The decadent cheesecake options are hard to say not to and often, each slice hovers around 1,000 calories. Wowza."
Tim M.,"Hutchinson, KS",23,20,13,5.0,1/1/2015,"Good food - wife had the chicken Alfredo with butterfly pasta, thought it was good.  I had the chicken and steak medallion combo and the meat was tender but I didn't particularly Luke the sweet sauce. Oreo cheesecake was quite delicious!"
LeAnn A.,"Springfield, MO",70,137,37,4.0,7/18/2014,"I've only been here two times, and they were both just for the cheesecake.  We've made this our dessert place after a date night.  We both picked a piece and shared.  Just ate at the high top tables.  The ones we had were the blueberry which is my other halve's go to.  Very good ""cheesecake"" flavor with this sweet blueberry makes it a nice pair with one of their chocolate choices. The only reason I can't give it a 5 star is because of it's price...I do know when I go there I will be spending more than expected but it's really good and don't go that often because of it."
Maggie C.,"New York, NY",529,353,369,2.0,5/4/2014,"I will never again dine here during the peak hour of dinner. Both experiences that I had during dinner was absolutely terrible. My most recent trip was to celebrate my birthday. My sister in law never received her water; my partner never received his food. It took the waiter 20 minutes to take our orders for drinks and 90 minutes before our food came out. When all the food did come out, my partner's veggie burger did not arrive. A manager came to personally apologize, my partner just told him to forget about his dinner--everyone else was already done eating."
George W.,"Oak Grove, MO",24,8,,1.0,5/11/2015,"This place has always been over priced but when I shared a meal with the wife and still spent over $65, I draw the line. We shared the gross Cobb salad, an appetizer, a 6 inch pizza and one slice of cheesecake. Hate to see what we would have spent on this poor quality of food had we ordered separate. Mind you we have several restaurants that we routinely go to where we spend over $100 each time, but they offer something that this place doesn't...quality....Do not order the Cobb salad. I can take blue cheese in moderation, but there is no other flavor to this salad"
Rhonda S.,"Independence, MO",787,1010,914,4.0,8/1/2012,"I had the privilege of eating cheesecake here on half price day. It was tough to choose when all the choices are half price.....so I had Sara D. help me cause, I figured she eats here more than I. I expected a huge long line, but we were seated promptly. I've never ordered anything but cheesecake in one of these. Granted, I asked if the cheesecake is actually made there or delivered frozen.  It is delivered frozen, from I don't know where. I think it's way too expensive at full price, but have no complaints about half price. I had a raspberry white chocolate truffle cheesecake. It had sprinkles of shaved white chocolate on top of the cheesecake. I was expecting raspberries, but it had some kind of pureed raspberries instead. It had a chocolate crust with 2 huge dollops of whipped cream.  The taste was classic Cheesecake Factory. I realize I can get these at Sam's Club at any time, but something is kind of cool about half price cheesecake day. But if they priced the cheesecake affordably in the first place,  we could enjoy it any time."
Cheyenne F.,"Olathe, KS",13,1,,3.0,1/6/2016,"The food was excellent but the proportions are ridiculously huge. I got the lunch size and it was still massive; I can't imagine what the dinner proportion looks like. It was really cold inside as well, I understand it's cold outside but when the majority of the guests still have their coats on while eating that's a little ridiculous. The host was very nice did a great greet and the manager was very nice as well when she cleared some plates from the table. However; the server was not so great. She walked past us several times when we had empty plates and empty drinks. We also needed boxes when we pushed our plates to the edge of the table and she had walked past us again. Didn't really upsale or recommend anything and we basically had to ask her if we could have dessert and hot tea. I'm a server as well and my review might be a little harsh, but there is definitely room for improvement."
Maria D.,"Kansas City, MO",0,10,,3.0,1/2/2016,"Service here is slow, inattentive, disorganized. The Food is consistent but staff needs a sense of urgency big time. Forget it if you are hoping for a quick lunch."
Dawn C.,"Overland Park, KS",110,343,113,4.0,5/30/2012,"The Cheesecake Factory is always a safe bet when going with a group since the menu is so huge that everyone is sure to find at least one thing to tempt them.  The downside for me has always been twofold: too many things offered with nothing really spectacular and the crazy calorie load of almost every single item.  I decided to give this place a 4th star today in honor of their new ""skinnylicious"" menu!  Hooray!  It's about time you could enjoy a nice lunch here for less than 2000 calories.  I had the Thai lettuce wraps and enjoyed them.   The veggies and lettuce were very fresh and the chicken was hot and juicy.  Three little sauces gave me lots to play with, and I do like sauces!   One of my lunch companions had the skinnylicious tacos and found them to be the perfect size.  Three soft shell tacos with a small bowl of Spanish rice as a side.  It was almost like they realized that people might like to eat here and actually have a little room left for a slice of cheesecake!  Another lunch companion had the meatloaf and said his wife makes one that is tastier.  Nevertheless he gave it a passing grade.  Our 4th person had a cheese pizza... we teased her a little but she insisted.  I had a slice and found that for a basic cheese pizza it actually had quite a lot of flavor.  Surprise! My slice of turtle cheesecake was boxed to go, and this evening when I enjoyed it with my husband (trust me there's plenty to share!) we both were grinning ear to ear like children on Christmas.  Yum!   It's a special once-every-now-and-then indulgence.  Do try the Cheesecake, ANY cheesecake, they certainly do it right.  Be cautious on your expectations of the food though...it's good but not stellar.  Were it not for the fun decor and the great service I might had downgraded this to a 3 star review."
Dana M.,"Springfield, MO",43,5,2,1.0,12/28/2015,"We had dinner Saturday p.m. and ordered the Chicken Alfredo. My niece ordered Chicken Alfredo off of the kids menu and it was really good but the dish we ordered had no garlic in it. Everyone at the table (7 of us) decided to try both dishes and compare the two. We all concluded that there was clearly no garlic in the watery ""grown up"" dish. We let our server know but there wasn't much food left on the plate after everyone decided to sample the meal. We didn't throw a fit or demand not to pay but after leaving and realizing that the server offered nothing has left me with a very bad reflection of the Cheesecake Factory. We paid $20 for a meal that was just simply awful. I find the restaurant to be overpriced and I cannot see myself returning to this business."
Sonia K.,"Overland Park, KS",11,97,42,5.0,7/30/2014,"I've been going to this Cheesecake Factory for almost 8 years! An oldie but a goodie. I even had my graduation dinner here and it was excellent. Great food, great service."
Michele F.,"Olathe, KS",10,16,4,5.0,10/21/2015,Absolutely love the Cheesecake Factory. We sat outside to enjoy the fall breeze. I had the Louisiana parmesan crusted chicken pasta.  It was fantastic. My boyfriend is extremely picky and he got the gumbo and he loved it.
Rachel K.,"Fairfield, IA",2,10,4,5.0,8/1/2015,This was a first for my husband but a 2nd time visit for me and my 14 year old daughter. It was a packed Saturday evening and the wait took over an hour and we had to park across the street at a grocery store since the parking lot was all full. We called a head and they don't take reservations on the weekends but we were able to enjoy a few drinks at the bar before we were seated. Once we were seated the server was amazing and had a lot of knowledge on the specials and menus. It was a must that we try the cheesecakes!
Angel S.,"Overland Park, KS",0,30,3,3.0,5/23/2015,"Such subpar food. I give this place three stars for ambience alone.  It is frequented by many. Perhaps due to extra take home portions. The bread bought to the table was cold and dried out. My date found his teriyaki meal was just ""ok"". My skinnylicious chicken tacos were fresh tasting and light. But, nothing as far as seasoning and overwhelmed with cilantro.  This place costs enough where meals should make you leave happy. I have had better at AppleBees"
Ashlee V.,"Tucson, AZ",10,131,24,5.0,3/29/2014,"One the better cheesecake factory's we've eaten at.  The hibotchi steak was amazing!  We were in town visiting and got it all to go... food was prepared quickly,  even on a busy Saturday night"
Mary A.,"Olathe, KS",0,17,9,4.0,8/8/2015,My husband enjoyed the Orange Chicken - his go to. I was a bit disappointed in the size of the Greek salad for the price - but taste was good. Love being able to get a table in bar quickly!
