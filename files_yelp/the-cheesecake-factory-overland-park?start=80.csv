Julie P.,"Hutchinson, KS",1,19,4,5.0,7/5/2014,"Omg! I have always heard good things about this place. The first time I came to KC and was going to go it was so packed the line was outside and it was going to take 45mins to seat 11 people.  We had 3 kids under 3 years old and couldn't wait that long.  My boyfriend and I came to KC for fun and we had to try it again. I am so glad we did. I didn't realize they had all kinds of food. From Italian, pizza, hamburgers, steaks, salads....almost everything. It took us a long time to decide because it all sounded good.  The staff was so nice and our waitress helped explain what was a top favorite.  Highly recommend. I got the fried shrimp with fries and slaw and a side of Mac and cheese. It was delicious."
Heather B.,"Olathe, KS",12,2,,3.0,6/26/2015,We decided to sit on the patio. The waitress greeted us in a timely manner. However while greetings us she proceeded to wipe the corners of her eyes.yuck! Then  We ordered nachos and cheesecake.  The nachos were hot but burned on edges. Cheesecake was good as usual.
Kolbie J.,"Manhattan, KS",99,29,31,5.0,8/21/2013,"I've been to many Cheesecake Factories and to this location at least 3 times.  Everybody loves Cheesecake Factory because they have such a large menu and everything always tastes so amazing!  I've never experienced a bad waiter or host, and I've never had a bad meal or drink from the bar."
Cali O.,"Overland Park, KS",54,11,1,3.0,2/20/2015,"I came in the other night and ordered a 10in cheesecake for a Chinese new party that happened last night. She told me that it would take a good two hours to let it thaw out. Picked up the cheesecake around 8:30pm, had it set out until we were ready to eat it which was after midnight. Still was completely frozen. Very dissapointed , especially having it cost $50."
Thomas A.,"Kansas City, KS",99,1029,1127,2.0,5/7/2013,"First thing, I am NOT a fan of Cheesecake Factory.  Way, way, way overrated.  But, one of our friends loves this place and this is where she wanted to eat for her birthday.  I had the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp.  I must admit that the flavors in this dish are delicious.  But what gets me about the Cheesecake factory is the portions are obscenely huge and what is obscene about it is the HUGE portions of carbohydrates, whether it be rice, noodles or some other starchy base.  Way too much starch/carbs.  I'm not a health nut either but it's like this is being done to make the dish look larger.  Why such gigongo portions?  I did take it home and ate it later after barhopping that night.  At least the carbs came in handy for that.  Anyway, I never have room for desert because of these monstrous portions of over-carbed dishes.  The place is always crowded so we know that people love the idea of the Cheesecake Factory.  The seating was comfortable and pleasant.  The server was pleasant and attentive.  I just don't really care for this place and would never come here voluntarily.  It's just me.  I know it's popular but seriously, the flavors are tame, mediocre at best."
Devin B.,"Overland Park, KS",3,28,66,1.0,11/11/2012,"Went with a group of seven for a b-day party. Called earlier in the day to make a reservation. Well they don't take reservations in advance and was told that you can make a reservation an hour before. We call an hour before and low and behold we are told ""you have to be here to put your name down"". Geeeeezus!!!  Our group arrives and we end up waiting over an hour just to get our table. Not off to a good start but this is where the b- day girl wants to eat so we tough it out. The food was ok and I say just ok because you would expect better for something that you eventually learn to be way overpriced.  $10 for a Mojito!  I would only come here again for dessert. Everything else is overrated and overpriced."
Ginger M.,"Joplin, MO",36,1055,759,4.0,11/30/2014,"When we are in the KC area, my husband and I tend to go for out of the way non-chains but this time we were too hungry to do our research and decided in our haste to grab a late dinner at Cheesecake Factory.  I'd been to the Plaza location before and prefer its atmosphere by far - this is definitely more of a bland restaurant but still perfectly fine.  While the decor is not to my taste and I was disappointed to find they took my beloved Vietnamese tacos off the small plates menu, I still had a very nice meal.  The host and our server were absolutely professional and friendly too.  We had to wait a few moments in the middle of the dining room for our table to be cleared, and the host made it clear that he appreciated our patience and regretted this happening.  We opted for omelets and they did not disappoint.  I had the chorizo and avocado which was a large, well made omelet with quality-tasting ingredients, alongside home fries and an English muffin.  It was roughly the same price I've paid for a lesser omelet in breakfast specialty restaurants.  After the huge portions we could not finish, my husband and I were not up for cheesecake but I'm sure all of the delicious sounding options don't disappoint."
Felisha M.,"Wichita, KS",5,16,2,5.0,2/26/2015,Very fast service. Waitress was nice. Food was delicious. I ordered spaghetti and meatballs. I shared with my 3 year old. Took out her portion and it barleu dented mine. I'm still taking leftovers to the hotel. I will be back again next time I'm in Kansas City.
Andy H.,"Kansas City, MO",70,41,7,3.0,3/12/2013,"Short review: The service at this location is great. I attended with a large party and our waitress was always on top of things, my water glass was never empty. Food: Mediocre. I am never really impressed with restaurants that offer a million different dishes and most of them are things that I can cook at home. My burger was mediocre, and I don't think I was given enough fries. Cheesecake was also mediocre. I've had better for cheaper."
Peter M.,"Warrensburg, MO",2,16,,4.0,3/8/2015,"Crab cakes were alright but the ""Everything"" pizza was awesome.  My wifes chicken and shrimp gumbo was semi-bland but wasn't horrible.  It was pretty packed when I went, but they still seated my party of 7 pretty quick.  Our waiter was very helpful and super patient with us.  Prices aren't too steep unless you're getting steak or seafood.  I would recommend this place for sure."
Scott P.,"Camdenton, MO",1,19,3,4.0,8/4/2014,"We went on a Saturday around 4pm and there were plenty of open tables, but we still had to wait.  I thought that was strange.  The food came promptly and was great.  Service was also good!  Decent experience overall."
Jake C.,"Kansas City, MO",62,100,30,3.0,7/24/2013,"Chain restaurants are never my thing, even when they're ""upscale"" like Cheesecake Factory. Most everyone knows what to expect here: a massive restaurant, with an equally massive menu covering everything from pasta to burgers and back. The food, in my experience, is pretty much the same across all the locations I've been to between here and Florida. That is to say, it's average across the board. That being said, the service was speedy and friendly, any issues we had were taken care of promptly. The cheesecake is still the big draw here. While it's pretty expensive, it's awesome. Maybe not D'bronx awesome, but it's close."
Steffon C.,"Shawnee, KS",48,120,17,4.0,6/16/2013,Best eggs benedict in town...? The quest continues!
Raven D.,"Overland Park, KS",1,21,2,1.0,5/30/2012,Went here on a weeknight for my Anniversary. Horrible service. Food sucked. Cheesecake was good.... Won't ever dine here again.
David C.,"Harrisonville, MO",0,8,,2.0,1/14/2015,"I have had a few good experiences here but the bad outweigh the good. On this visit, I ordered the Cajun Chicken Littles. The mashed potatoes were just barely warm and cold on the edges by the time I finished eating. The chicken tenders were warm but if they had just come out of the fryer, they would have been too hot to eat. I think my meal was completed and waiting to be served.  Our waiter, Evan, was very friendly but I finished my drink over 5 minutes before he checked on us. Since the chicken tenders were spicy, I was getting thirsty. When he finally came to refill our drinks, he left and didn't come back with another drink for 10 minutes. I had to resort to drinking my wife's drink. Overall not a pleasant dining experience. The Godiva cheesecake is wonderful if you like chocolate."
Tracy K.,"Lawrence, KS",0,16,3,4.0,12/14/2014,"We had to wait 40 to 50 minutes, was seated and greeted by our waitress (Sara). I ordered the hibachi steak, unfortunately they were out of it, so I settled for Steak Dianne. Didn't think I would like the change, but it was very good. My wife ordered for dessert was Kahului cocoa cheesecake, and they were out of it also.  Waitress (Sara) handled the situation very well. We were very pleased with our visit. Only suggestion I would make is that they get an intercom system to backup the already in place the paging systems. Waitress was very attentive to all our requests and kept us very much informed why she may not have been there when we needed her."
William W.,"Newton, MA",0,3,,5.0,11/21/2015,Excellent service- we had 12 in our party and the food was served promptly without delay- we had a birthday cake sent to the table and desserts after were huge- food was super- the grand burrito is big enough for three people. The service made the difference for me on this review- it was at a high level.
Chris R.,"Olathe, KS",0,23,6,5.0,7/16/2014,"Came in while my car was at blue valley goodyear. I asked for a suggestion for a lunch salad as I was undecided. Caleb, kim and jeff were super helpful. Caleb suggested the kale and quinoa salad which I never would have ordered, or found because it is an appetizer salad(he didnt try to push me at a higher priced item) He was right about the salad, it was terrific. it was also large for an appetizer so I didn't need anything considering they also bring you bread.  Ive always been a CCF fan, this trip just reminded me so. The friendliness behind the bar and great salad made for a pleasant prequel to what im sure will be bad news from the auto shop."
Jill V.,"Manhattan, KS",12,15,1,5.0,9/28/2014,Came here with my brother and mom for a late lunch.. We got there right at 2 so we asked if my brother was too late for the brunch special (it ended at 2 PM) and the server said no problem... So he was able to order what he wanted. He got a Belgian waffle and it was really good. My mom got the chicken tacos and she liked them. I had the pasta da Vinci and it was great! Pasta with chicken and mushrooms. I recommend it. We all had cheesecake and other than it being amazing there is not much more to say!! Great experience and our server was attentive. Will be back :)
