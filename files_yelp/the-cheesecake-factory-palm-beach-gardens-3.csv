Lucero B.,"Santa Barbara, CA",5,13,5,4.0,4/12/2017,"presentation, freshness and taste are good  in general.  4 star because salmon was raw to the point I just decided to leave there. I think cheese cake factory serves farm raise salmon added coloring."
Jason B.,"Atlanta, GA",16,187,46,4.0,12/8/2014,It's a Cheesecake Factory. Good service. You know the food. If you haven't guessed they serve any type of cheesecake you want.
