Kim M.,"Port St. Lucie, FL",0,18,,5.0,8/15/2017,My friend from New York took me to this Cheesecake Factory on my birthday for lunch on Monday August 14th. When our waitress Kristen approached she was very knowledgeable and very helpful and very patient because my friend and I were deciding on different drinks to order appetizers and meals. Everything our server recommended was great I had a whiskey honey drink my friend had a lemonade alcohol  drink we shared the cauliflower appetizer I had a great California. avocado salad and my friend had the salmon luncheon. Since our server Kristen noticed I had birthday card and present she knew it was my birthday we were too full for dessert but she still brought over a little ice cream with whipped cream and sprinkles and a candle and said happy birthday because she knew we didn't like singing I thought that was very kind of her and very nice and I highly recommend Kristen and I think she should get a raise!
PJ N.,"Ruskin, FL",0,134,,2.0,12/3/2017,"this was our first visit to a cheesecake factory, just wanted to get a quick luncheon salad and this place was close by.....wish we would have been a little more selective...... i don't get the hype about this chain restaurant......the place is SO loud, especially with all the screaming kids and loud mouthed parents talking on cell phones....... server was friendly but TOOK FOREVER to get us drinks, serve lunch and even longer to try to get the check and pick up the payment.  the salads we ordered, i felt, were just too coated in salad dressing.  the only highlight i can say was the delicious bread served, otherwise, just NOT impressed enough to ever think about returning......"
Alana E.,"Boynton Beach, FL",109,110,35,2.0,11/11/2017,"I'm not a huge fan of CF to begin with, I think the menu is overwhelming and food not that great, but every once and a while I go because others want to. So today we got there and had to wait 10 or 15 minutes for a nearly empty restaurant. So we sit down and look at the crazy bible menu, which to me has a whole lot of nothing. I decided on the goat salad, which I've had before and my mom got the warm crab dip. Mine comes out and I swore in the past it had fried goat cheese, but this time it didn't. No worries there mine was good I can't complain. My mom, however, took a bite of her bread and it was literally rock hard and the crab dip was just gross. So we signaled the waitress who came over begrudgingly and asked her if she wanted chips, instead. She sent it back because it literally tasted horrendous and ordered the spinach artichoke dip. So in the interim we are given butter and no bread. Finally, the spin dip comes out and it was good, but you can tell we pissed the waitress off because we got attitude central after we sent her food back. Then I looked at the spin dip plate and there's green stuff on it that in no way represents our order (see pic). Kinda gross, I'm hoping it was just food that rubbed off on the plate and not a dirty plate. Then we waited another half hour before we got the check. In other news, I don't know why I don't learn my lesson, I don't understand the hype except unhealthy people eat here for the quantity, not the quality. And don't even get me started on the service. Too bad, this used to be one of my favorite chains when it first opened.."
Krishna N.,"Riviera Beach, FL",248,73,173,4.0,5/7/2017,"This place is always a hit or miss. Sometimes the food is like wow, this is the best meal ever and other times it's like we'll wish it was better. There's been a few times when I ordered the steak Diane where I was overly impressed with how the sauce was made and other times where I asked for medium well steak and they gave me pretty much medium rare and I've sent it back. That fish for sure has been a hit or miss.  The buffalo ranch chicken salad is amazing. My favorite salad there to order for sure. The salads are so huge here. Ask for dressing on the side though sometimes they drench the salad a little too much for me. But if you like dressing overload then ask for it to be tossed into the salad. The happy hour for food is really good. The food is so cheap and they give you so much for being happy hour. The drinks are nothing special though. My favorite item is the crab wontons they give you ten of them. I like that they have the calorie count next to the food. Some people may not like it but for me it's helpful. I also like to order the Greek salad. My favorite happy hour salad. Big enough to be filling.  Overall I think you have to try this cheesecake location. It's not the best one but it's good enough. You may get that amazing dish that one day so it's worth a try."
Vanessa B.,"Windermere, FL",294,153,203,3.0,5/23/2016,"I was meeting up with my family for my father's birthday, and we thought this Cheesecake Factory location would be more convenient.  We're no strangers to Cheesecake Factory - most of our family get togethers involve a meal out at Cheesecake Factory. Normally, we go to the Boca Raton location. FOOD (3.5/5): The bread was a little on the tough side - as if it sat too long in the bread warmer.  We ordered some calamari, which we usually love from Cheesecake.  However, the breading fell off easily, and there were so many pieces stuck together that it made it difficult to share without tearing the pieces apart.  I also feel like the portion size was smaller.  I ordered the lunch salad, soup, and turkey sandwich combo.  The soup of the day, cream of chicken, was rather runny and watery for my taste.  The sandwich bread was really soggy, and I'm not sure why.  My brother and father each ordered the lunch orange chicken, which seemed more like the batter than the actual chicken.   SERVICE (4/5): I waited at the hostess stand for a few minutes before anyone greeted me.  While the hostess was busy on the phone, there were other servers who were just standing around.  Eventually, someone asked me if I needed to put a name on the wait list.  Our server was pretty good.   ATMOSPHERE (3/5):  It was pretty loud in the restaurant.  However, it is very well lit (at least in the afternoon - I can't speak about lighting in the evening).  The decor reminds me of Grand Lux Cafe, which makes sense since Cheesecake Factory and Grand Lux Cafe are sister restaurants.  Up front, they showcase their cheesecakes, which they are known for.  There's parallel parking on the street, or if you can't find street parking, a parking garage located very close to the restaurant. Overall, I'd rather drive the extra 30 minutes to the Boca location next time."
Khamisi G.,"Jupiter, FL",30,48,98,1.0,8/20/2017,"In a nutshell, we waited three hours to be seated which was understandable because we had a party of 30 and they don't accept reservations. But when we asked why we had to wait so long for a table, the manager lied at first then she told us that the tables were available the entire time but were not cleaned off yet.  The manager never apologized for the miscommunication/error on their part. We asked her would she at least offer the birthday girl something to make up for the mistake.... She refused then rudely asked us, "" so are you going to eat here or not?"""
Joe C.,"Canton, OH",50,10,1,2.0,12/26/2016,"Let me start out by saying that we love Cheesecake Factory. We don't go there often, so it's usually for a special occasion. This visit was for my daughter's 11th birthday with our Florida family. There were 11 of us altogether, with 7 adults, 1 teen, 2 tweens and 1 child.  We were seated relatively swiftly, no problems there. We placed our drink order, and no problems there either. We placed our order for appetizers and dinner and that's where things unfortunately went off the rails. Our 2 appetizers (corn tamales and spinach dip) arrived 3 minutes before our main meals. The waitress apologized but there was no clear reason why this happened. Needless to say, we were unable to enjoy the appetizers before the main meals came. Ok, irritating, but not horrible.  However, when the food arrived, my daughter started eating her macaroni and cheese burger with mashed potatoes. It seemed to be ok, but when she dug into the mashed potatoes and took a bite, there was a rotten potato there. Curious why there was a whole potato in ""mashed potatoes"" but nevertheless it was there. My daughter gagged and refused to eat any more of the potatoes. Honestly, it ruined her dinner. The manager was asked to come over and he did. He took my daughter's meal off our bill.  All in all, it was mostly a good visit and would have earned a higher rating, but the inexplicable food arrival time and rotten mashed potatoes definitely spoiled the meal."
Sarah K.,"Lake Worth, FL",170,18,8,5.0,3/28/2017,This is the best Cheesecake Factory location we have been to! Our server Laura was fantastic and very knowledgeable. The food came out in good timing and was fresh and tasted great! Glad we gave Cheesecake Factory a second chance.
Jane B.,"Stuart, FL",11,47,,5.0,11/4/2017,"I went to lunch yesterday with two friends.  The service by Stephanie S was wonderful.  She kept checking on our table to see if our lunch was good, did we need anything, more iced tea?  Our lunches were delicious and the cheesecake for dessert were scrumptious, we each had a different kind!  We will be back"
Gary G.,"Westwood, NJ",0,13,15,5.0,10/23/2017,"My wife and I and our adult daughter stopped here for lunch after church. The appetizer were good. The entrees were also good and then the cheesecake Dessert was great! Did I mention the service, it was the best."
Amanda A.,"Delray Beach, FL",6,73,30,5.0,5/19/2017,Dined in today and had a great experience. Jennifer was our server and she was very attentive and friendly! Food was great as always.
St R.,"Tampa, FL",0,26,4,4.0,6/30/2017,Great variety for non meat eaters and the staff was exceptional while dealings with our son's severe food allergy. Edom (manager maybe?) spoke with us milfoil with times personally to ensure the allergen free food was cooked properly and that everything was fine once our son was eating. Great location at the mall with theatre etc.
Kevin C.,"Palm Beach Gardens, FL",0,1,,1.0,8/20/2017,I ordered pick up food and was told it would take 20 to 25 minutes. I called and they said they would have it out and they must have forgotten that I was there. I called back 30 minutes later and they acted like I never let them know I was sitting outside. Everything I ordered that was supposed to be hot was cold and the cold food was now warm. Not a good place to order take out from.
Shannan C.,"West Palm Beach, FL",37,7,,5.0,8/17/2017,"Lovely outdoor seating in beautiful Downtown at the Gardens in Palm Beach Gardens. Enjoyed delicious food and beverages with my family. Great service from John, who was thoughtful and accommodating from beginning to end."
Latanya R.,"West Palm Beach, FL",0,2,,5.0,6/14/2017,"Did a little shopping and thought I would stop by for Miso Salmon and the Asian Pear Martini.. I sat at the bar and bartender Jennifer was so AWESOME.. great service, the salmon was great and the martini was perfect!"
Monique H.,"Riviera Beach, FL",174,24,1,1.0,4/14/2017,Disgusting. My 4 year old son got bad food poisoning from this place. Never seen anyone that sick in my life. The people can't even make sure to not give bad food to a child?? Disgusting!!!
Johnathan E.,"West Palm Beach, FL",37,6,,5.0,3/16/2017,"This is really my go to spot for veggie burgers. What I do is order the Americano burger and switch it out for veggie patty. Extra sauce on the side no onions, add pickles, now you are on your way to a great veggie burger!!"
Jon N.,"Jupiter, FL",31,63,2,4.0,2/18/2017,"I wrote a review 11/12/16 which wasn't very favorable.   I hate to seem like a chronic complainer.   Last time I complained about the food, this time I must complain about our waiter.   When I spend close to $100 on dinner (4 people) I expect to have a wonderful experience food and service.  Wasn't the case this time.  The food was good, the service sucked. We sat outside, our server was David.   We were told David was busy so a waitress (didn't get her name) came over to help him until he became available.   She took the drink order.   My wife asked how much the martini's were.  She was going to get wine, decided to get a lemon drop martini.   The waitress said she didn't know, she would check.   She came back and told us $10.50 with well drinks.   So we ordered one.  Two others at the table ordered coffee.  David finally showed up with all the drinks, no coffee.   Said the coffee was strong, so he made some more.   Finally, just before the meal comes out David delivered the coffee.   Said he tripped and spilled the coffee so he had to go back inside to make more, he was sorry.    The food was delivered, David never came over to check out how things were going.   We had to flag him down because the people wanted some grated cheese.   David said oh, I thought I asked you.   I said, David you have to come  over to the table to ask.   Let me say, that was the last time we saw David until the check.  No refill on drinks.  Never even came around to ask.   My glass was empty, when he came around to see if we wanted dessert he saw it was empty and never even offered.   $3 a pop for drinks and you don't even get a refill.  We get the check I see they charged $12.50 for the martini.   When I asked about it, he said he told the waitress to come over and tell us about the mistake.    Again, I got a sorry.   Really, the waitress quotes us a price and then we get charged $2 more?  Well, I am DONE with this Cheesecake Factory.    I hate to see anyone work for free, so I tipped EVEN  he wasn't worth what I left.   Usually I get great service, I just happened to get stuck with David."
Chuck C.,"Rochester, NH",0,16,,4.0,3/10/2017,Hadn't been here in a couple of years . We had forgotten what a great choice there was on the menu . Both had a very tasty lunch.  I went with the sesame chicken    Very tasty and portions are great.   Finished off with a slice of salted caramel cheesecake.  Yum
Kara F.,"Bruges, Belgium",52,56,84,4.0,8/4/2015,"We were seated right away as we did not mind sitting outside. To sit inside with the  A/C was a wait. The food we ordered came out in about 15 min which was not bad considering it was pretty full for a Tuesday night.  Prices are on the higher end for what you get, but you expect that at a high end chain restaurant."
Chris P.,"West Palm Beach, FL",40,94,165,4.0,7/18/2014,"The Cheesecake Factory has a high end decor combined with reasonably priced food.  It's family friendly, which is not necessarily a plus for my wife and I.   The menu is so big it needs a table of contents, plus they have a reduced calorie menu which was a very smart touch.  If you can't find something you like on their menu, you're definitely a picky eater.   Our waiter was named Jeff and is probably the best server we've had anywhere in this area.   We started with the edamame appetizer which is on the reduced calorie menu.  They were excellent and a pleasant surprise finding them on the menu.   The food was adequate and in line with the prices.  I would definitely recommend the Cheesecake Factory over J Alexander's, which is second rate in comparison.   The only downside for us was the table of noisy kids behind us, but you can't blame the restaurant for that."
Ronaldo G.,"Jupiter, FL",309,32,270,4.0,5/11/2016,Always great service and ample portions.  Our Thai lettuce wrap appetizers rocked.  Everything was tasty and filling.  Cheesecake to go!
Jacqueline C.,"Palm Beach Gardens, FL",2,18,7,3.0,2/29/2016,"Usually my favorite restaurant. Definitely a go-to since they have so much to choose from.  However, a friend of mine ordered the Renee special that she usually always gets but this time the sandwich was served on a HOT DOG BUN.  Ridiculous."
Raymond L.,"Pineapple Park / Ibis, West Palm Beach, FL",29,1,,5.0,6/21/2017,Why risk your time and money going anywhere else?  This place gets it right every time!!!
Sarah H.,"Jupiter, FL",9,16,2,4.0,7/30/2016,Huge dinner menu that has an option for literally everyone. The portions are also huge and great to split between 2-3 people. There are lots of options for groups and great for birthdays. The service does take a long time so do not come when you are in a rush. I recommend the Chris's outrageous cheesecake more than any on the menu. I like their skinny menu because there food is not exactly the healthiest. The skinny menu is still delicious and I recommend the chopped salad.
Stacey T.,"Jupiter, FL",0,10,3,3.0,8/12/2016,Got the cracked conch for appetizer. It was ok. I had the special of papaya shrimp and my husband had the grouper sandwich. It seems to be a local hangout. Too smoky to eat outside. Waitress was great!
Enzo R.,"Palm Beach Gardens, FL",0,6,,1.0,6/11/2016,"Wishing there was 0 stars currently. Even after you decide what you want to eat after studying an entire bible of what they say to be a menu, you are greeted with an average service and a barely enjoyable meal, thats just the food though. When we as a party of 8 were entering the restaurant looking to put our name in to wait. The hostess was EXTREMELY RUDE. I've never had to deal with such a sarcastic experience. Such a person should be working at a morgue rather than a restaurant. After my experience, i will not be coming back."
Ryan B.,"Palm Beach Gardens, FL",57,6,1,5.0,10/28/2016,Outstanding experience and great menu. We went to celebrate a special occasion and were pleasantly surprised at everything.
C P.,"West Palm Beach, FL",13,163,527,2.0,10/24/2015,"Food has always been average at best here.  It appeals to the masses. I dine here once in a while because it tends to please most people.   Our server was nice but we did not find her mannerisms favorable.  her efforts are commendable enough. Bread came, sourdough and honey wheat, with square pieces of hard butter wrapped in foil. We ordered the Falafel Salad with dressing on the side.  I found it mildly disturbing when the dressing arrived well before the meal and filled to the brim of the container, pouring onto the table using the slightest touch. The salad served with kale, stale pita pieces and a good amount of falafel balls barely held together falling apart as I gently cut through it with a fork. The dressing was bottled greek with soft crumbled feta in the middle.   It was not bad all in all.  My hunger tends to skew my opinions.  So at the moment it was sufficient in satisfying a primal need. I'm still baffled by how this chain continues to attract so many people with its mediocrity in food, service, and venue."
Donna B.,"Vero Beach, FL",17,171,279,1.0,9/9/2015,"I've been to many Cheesecake Factorys' in different cities and have always had decent food and service but on this day disappointed would be an understatement. Shit food. Shit service. It was after the lunch rush on a Tuesday afternoon. Service was slow from the time we sat down. Took awhile just to order beverages.  I ordered the pit beef sandwich...took one bite, it was awful and tasted like it wasn't fresh so I told the server about it and she asked me what else I'd like instead...i ordered a burger.  At the time I ordered burger. We decided on a slice of sea carmel cheesecake to share, so I ordered that, the server, I guess asssumed that we would take go, had it boxed in a to go container...I ordered it to share for here, not to go. So now the burger arrived, by another server, dropped it in front of me and left, I wanted mustard, server nowhere to be found, ate half way through it. My lady friend knew I was getting annoyed and stood up to find the manager. I told her sit back down and relax and I would find the manager. Manager apologized and took off the burger and my friends salad.  In the past, I've usually had good experiences at a cheesecake factory, but today I was so embarassed to bring my friend here, she said she's never coming back again. It was her first and last time here and now mine too."
Rick B.,"West Palm Beach, FL",0,6,1,5.0,9/20/2016,Love this place! Always on point. Always clean and professional and the food is delicious!!! Never had a bad experience at this location. Highly recommend!! Cheesecake is only a small part of what they do well. The Glam Burger with mac n cheese on it is unreal!! Whether it's breakfast lunch or dinner The Cheesecake Factory is phenomenal.
A. M.,"West Palm Beach, FL",19,54,5,2.0,5/22/2016,"Used to be our ""go to"" place for a decent meal with the family.  It's gotten worse and worse over the years to the point where it's just not at all palatable anymore.  On our recent Saturday night visit the table was set but the knives were missing and despite asking our server to bring some they never appeared.  When our food was delivered no one came to ask if we wanted cheese for the pasta or how our meal was or if there was anything that we needed.  The service was horrific and it wasn't even a busy night.  We won't be back unless we absolutely have no other choice."
Jaclyn S.,"Boynton Beach, FL",0,15,,5.0,9/26/2016,"This is my favorite place to eat! The food here is always fresh and delicious. The wait staff is always friendly and knowledgeable about the food. I highly recommend the steak medallions, my word they are exquisite. As always you can't go wrong with a piece of cheesecake they are all soooooo good!"
Cristina W.,"Hollywood, FL",594,262,206,3.0,4/6/2016,"For starters, don't sit me in a dirty table and pass a rag to me to clean the table. To quote Cher Horowitz' famous two words: ""As If!""... Aside from that, the waiter was attentive and brought everything in a timely manner. The food is the same as other Cheesecake Factory locations and the decor is the same as well.  In a nice, downtown Palm Beach area, with a big parking garage. I will definitely return, IF, the table is cleaned before hand. :)"
Teri W.,"Leesburg, IN",0,12,20,5.0,3/20/2016,"Creamy, crunchy,  spicy!  Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp. .. my favorite! Unfortunately, it doesn't come in a lunch size portion so I had no room for cheesecake.  We had a very attentive waiter.   Short wait time for our party of six."
Joanne L.,"North Palm Beach, FL",16,75,155,4.0,7/29/2015,"Dinner with girls group before a 7pm movie. In and out without a worry as to time. Tasty light menu items at a reasonable price, and still room left for a slice of cheesecake."
Julie C.,"Royal Palm Beach, FL",15,17,8,5.0,11/16/2014,"Luau salad is bursting with flavor!!! I couldn't eat enough of it. Mango, peppers, wonton layers with veggies had me wanting to lick my fingers! Definitely a salad you need to eat with your hands instead of a fork.  The Bang Bang Chicken was good but not great. The curry tasted a little bland maybe in need of a kick of spice and a hint of salt. Sangria was good and service is always outstanding! So much that we bypass The Cheesecake Factory in City Place because this location is clean with service that is impeccable."
Melissa B.,"Brookfield, CT",51,91,13,4.0,5/26/2016,"Made a reservation for 6:15 and they usually stop reservations at 6:00 but they did it for my friend and I. We sat down outside right away and the server was great. We enjoyed fast drinks, ice tea and brought me equal as soon as I asked. We had to flatbread pizza's to share. Tomato and Mozzarella with the pears and pecan flatbread with blue cheese. They were both delicious but they did bring the bread out late. Then cappuccino's which were very good, we asked for extra cream... No problem. The best thing is they didn't rush us. I love restaurants that do not push you!"
David B.,"Roslyn, NY",19,136,86,2.0,7/21/2016,At one time it was pretty good I would not go out of my way and for sure I would not wait in line to get in if you do go only thing I can recommend are the desserts the meals are mediocre you can get just as good at any diner
Lisa S.,"Palm Beach Gardens, FL",5,78,29,4.0,3/20/2016,"We go here an embarrassing amount since it's so close to the movies, but this chain is consistently good & with 10 pages of items to choose from not including their bazillion cheesecakes, why wouldn't you. It gets super busy on weekends & most evenings but it's a go to for our family. The only things we ever had that were not great were the bang bang shrimp (NOT at all like Bonefish) and the Margarita pizza (NOT a true margarita with no fresh ingredients & tasted like Dijourno). However, we've each all had many things here & go in groups and love everything else. Most items (including the cheesecake) should be split!! HUGE portions."
