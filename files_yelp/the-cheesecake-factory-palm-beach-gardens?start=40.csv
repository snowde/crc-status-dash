Jim G.,"Palm Beach Gardens, FL",64,28,7,3.0,3/27/2015,Lots of choices to pick from. There salads are to die for. All very fresh . cheese cakes are pricey but amazing.
Wesley M.,"Jersey City, NJ",251,311,6,2.0,1/5/2014,"This restaurant is majestic and the servers are friendly. This are the only two reasons this place even gets stars. I was really excited for my first experience, but was let down in service and food. The only redeeming quality was that the prices were reasonable and the calamari was good and came out quickly. Otherwise the food and beverages took forever. I had the chicken Madeira as my entree, which is keyed add their most popular dish. It sounds good on paper - chicken breast topped with mushrooms, mozzarella, and asparagus with mashed potatoes on the side. But in reality it was just packed with salt and no real flavor.  Florida is packed with food chains and there are a lot so I probably won't be returning here."
Eric S.,"Palm Beach Gardens, FL",89,15,3,5.0,10/24/2015,"You can't go wrong with The Cheesecake Factory, and this location definitely lives up to the name. The menu is huge, so whatever you are craving, they probably have it! My favorite is the meatloaf, it is so delicious! Any other food I have gotten at this restaurant has been top notch! And if you are looking for Cheesecake? Of course this is the place to go!"
Lolly A.,"Kearny, NJ",101,24,4,3.0,1/27/2015,"Cheesecake Factory is a chain known for its large menu and large portions. They have food for all tastes and it's great for sharing with pals. There's always a wait to get inside on the weekends even though you have many seating options including : inside (booths, high tops, bar seating, tables) outside (traditional tables on a covered patio, or along the sides of the facility without head covering.)  The hostess staff are very nice people and they give very accurate ETA for seating. This is great if you're catching a movie within the next hour and may not be able to stay for the duration.  I've always enjoyed the factory burger, factory burrito and the drinks. The drawback : the place is expensive, like really, really expensive. My boyfriend and I ordered two factory burgers and two drinks - $65 bill. My eyes almost fell out of my face when I saw the total. They do not print pricing for beverages and one of the drinks was $17. One drink. $17. It was a great drink, but holy moly!"
Andre S.,"Palm Beach Gardens, FL",71,4,3,4.0,4/23/2016,Really enjoy dining there. However their policy for not taking same-day reservations and not taking reservations after 4PM is utterly annoying.
Elaine W.,"Palm Beach Gardens, FL",4,5,6,4.0,7/20/2015,"The eggplant was tender, & the pasta was delicious.the presentation was real nice. The pesto sauce on the penne was very aromatic, & so  smooth, The eggplants were small & tender, & rather sweet. The staff was very attentive, & brought our refill drinks, & bread often. The atmosphere was very pretty ."
K C.,"Wellington, FL",22,115,581,1.0,12/30/2014,"What kind of restaurant doesn't take reservations or call ahead in this day and age????? This policy keeps us away time and time again .... We miss the Mac n Cheese Burger, Chicken Costelleta and Shrimp Club.  Please consider changing your policy and at least take call ahead!!"
Deb M.,"Jupiter, FL",29,21,34,4.0,2/17/2015,"Went with the whole family and everyone enjoyed their meals. We did notice the ""dinner"" size portion was smaller than what we were used to receiving for The Cajun pasta dish. Loaded baked potato soup was tasty, a bit heavy on the bacon but overall very good. Tried the buffalo bites which were surprisingly large for being named bites. Very yummy though, hot wing sauce and cheese on the inside of long fried chicken triangle strip like things. Server was  attentive if somewhat obsessed with clearing my plate that I was saving for a latecomer to the meal...which I had told him, but he had a hard time hearing anything I said to him."
Dana M.,"Jupiter, FL",36,67,60,1.0,6/11/2015,Ugh...  What a horrible experience.   We decided to pop in after leaving Costco AND there was no line!!!!  We have been here many times.  Jade ordered wings.  The waitress advised that there were very hot but she ordered them anyway.  They were too hot for her in the end but that is our fault since they warned us.  I ordered the chicken tostado salad.   The presentation was nice BUT there was a really long hair mixed through the lettuce.  YUCK YUCK YUCK!!!  Jade ordered strawberry cheesecake which was room temperature and not very tasty.   It was super soft and gross.  Probably our last visit for a very long time
Tracy S.,"Palm Beach Gardens, FL",4,2,2,1.0,6/13/2015,"It took us 50 minutes to get are food , we will not be coming back on a Saturday night EVER ! Had my granddaughter with us and they didn't even bring her mac &Cheese to her first"
Makena K.,"Altamonte Springs, FL",35,101,558,1.0,3/7/2014,"Worst Cheesecake Factory EVER!!  Hubby ordered wings.  It was supposed to an even mix of drumsticks and wings.  He only got one drumstick.  Manager came and rectified the situation by bringing him 4 separate drumsticks. This is, of course, after she admitted that the reason why my husband only got one drumstick was because the kitchen had cooked the last of the wing batch.  Our dinner experience when downhill from there.  I ordered Orange Chicken. They gave me mini bite size, very, very DRY pieces with a couple dry chunks pieces.  They said they would remake it & I agree.  The manager offered a complimentary soup while waiting for my meal.  The soup came COLD!  I sent it back. I asked them to pack my up my Orange Chicken.  Then we left!      I will not be back here.  Just stay away...."
Lou S.,"Oakland, MI",3,24,10,4.0,4/2/2014,We were here two years ago and didn't care for it. Decided to give another chance this trip.  Best decision we made.  It was terrific We were there on Tuesday night March 18 and I had the Tortilla Soup fantastic. The waiter suggested the Chicken Madera it was like a gourmet restaurant. We won't miss it next time we are in Palm Beach
Racquida W.,"Central Business District, New Orleans, LA",1,1,,1.0,10/3/2015,"I've been to many Cheesecake Factory restaurants and I am not sure what this particular restaurants issue was. We were seated for a long time and I had to go ask someone who my waiter was, came to find out he passed our table 20 times. Then a couple who are of a different persuasion came and sat down 20 min after we did and they were served drinks right away. Now I am not sure what the issue is, perhaps because we are black or I had two kids with me; but there is no reason we were treated that way when the restaurant was 10% full at 12:00pm. Needless to say I want a manager!!!!!!"
Erin P.,"Atlanta, GA",12,50,985,5.0,3/9/2014,"I was actually contacted in regards to the unsatisfactory review I posted. I had a fruitful conversation with the manager of the location, and she was apologetic for our poor experience. I appreciated the genuine concern she gave in taking steps to amend our previous transaction. She was generous in her efforts to remedy the situation. I never expected anything to come from this, so it was a delight to know they truly care about their guests."
Shaun H.,"West Palm Beach, FL",24,36,34,4.0,8/1/2014,"Everything that you would expect from Cheesecake Factory.  DT at the Gardens or City Place in WPB, FL - you can't go wrong."
Jamie K.,"Boca Raton, FL",15,77,161,4.0,5/26/2014,"Happy hour 4-6 Monday thru Thursday with great food specials all $5! Full portions of sliders, chicken sliders, artichoke, and fresh guac are all amazing! A must have. You have to sit in the bar but it's worth it! Not 5 stars cause there's no happy hour on the weekend :/"
Silvina G.,"Hialeah, FL",3,10,17,5.0,8/11/2015,"This restaurant is conveniently located in downtown Palm beach gardens, a few minutes before closing  we called in a to go order of the Godiva cheesecake and 2 scoops of vanilla ice cream. When we arrived they had the cheesecake ready and asked us to wait a few minutes for the ice cream. The cheesecake was so fresh, my husband and I we decided to eat it together seating on a bench overlooking the lake, it was all so good! You can't ever go wrong with cheesecake from here"
Janet E.,"Chicago, IL",1121,2033,899,4.0,9/7/2011,"Wonderful service and we didn't even have to step inside the restaurant!! We ordered our food for curbside pick up.  I had never heard of such a thing until I arrived in West Palm Beach, but now that I've experienced it, I wish more restaurants did this!  Basically, we placed our order ahead of time and told them what type of car we were driving. When we arrived, we called the restaurant and told them we were outside waiting at one of their designated curbside/to go parking spots. The server came out and met us and delivered our food to us while we sat in the car.  We paid and then left!  What a genius idea! Unfortunately the food was only okay.  I had the shrimp bistro pasta which is usually one of my favorite dishes but the batter on the shrimp was too much and it was fried in clumps instead of individually spread out across my pasta.  The peanut butter cup cake was delicious though!"
Christine C.,"Annapolis, MD",298,571,138,2.0,11/27/2013,"This location was so disappointing.  We went here for lunch on Wednesday with two small children and three adults.  We were seated at the bar (even though most of the restaurant was empty).  The hostess was nice and quick.  We were seated in a table that had bench seating on one side.  The bench smelled so badly of mildew that we played musical chairs until we all realized the bench was just very stinky and it was difficult to overcome the smell.  Also when we had been sat down the table tops were completely dirty of food.   The waitress moved us to another table right next to the kitchen in the corner of the restaurant.  I felt a little insulted here as well.  They completely moved us into a very unpretty corner of the restaurant.  They offered no compensation or apology that was worth coming back.   We requested bread, they did not provide it.  The second waiter seemed attentive but vanilla and not very happy to have us put in his section.  It was disappointing as I have had such a good experiences in other restaurants.   The food was ok.  My salad was on the side of a sandwich.  My food was ok, my sandwich seemed a bit small.  The children's food was perfect, simple, just as we ordered.  My mom's salad looked good and my husband's food including the fries looked great.  So the food was ok, but I definitely wondered about how clean the location was or how they were really did not seemed very concerned with our concerns.   We will not be going back here to eat.  I will continue to go to other Cheesecake Factory locations though."
Jennifer K.,"Cotswold, Charlotte, NC",50,202,22,5.0,1/17/2013,"great place, lots of options, huge menu. The skinny menu is my favorite, asian lettuce wraps and the pear pizza"
