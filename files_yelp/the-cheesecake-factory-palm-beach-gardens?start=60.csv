Denise M.,"Milwaukee, WI",28,27,45,3.0,9/24/2014,"I have been to the cheesecake factory before so i'm not a first-timer.  And I am quite sure what you order makes a big difference in your eval of each visit.  Yesterday I flew into West Palm so decided on CCF because I knew the menu was extensive enough that everyone could find something they wanted, especially on my low carb diet!  Dad ordered a Kobe burger (not sure if it was real kobe), mom and I salads.  All three of us ordered the tortilla soup - the only one offered for the day.  Now, if you're only going to offer one soup choice for the day, it better be a darn good one.  This one missed the mark in my opinion.  It lacked any depth of flavor.  The rice was both clumpy and mushy and it didn't have any chunks of chicken or meat of any sort.  it needed some zing in the flavor; more cilantro would have been good as well.  I also ordered the chicken tostada or tortilla salad.  It was good....it wasn't fabulous because i'm not a big fan of balsalmic.  The menu didn't say it was balsalmic or I might have ordered a different salad or dressing.  I probably wouldn't order it again but only for that reason.  To me vinegar is like wine....the flavor can make or break a meal.  If you don't mind balsalmic vinegar then you would enjoy this salad.  Mom's Asian salad looked very good and she enjoyed it."
Beth R.,"Vandalia, IL",0,3,,5.0,2/28/2016,"This was our 1st Cheesecake experience, we were well pleased. We chose to eat outside under the heaters, so our wait was short. We had an older waitress, but she was very nice and we had no problems.  We each had enough food leftover for lunch the next day. Ordered a slice of cheesecake to go, do think they fave us snickers instead of reeces, but still good."
Shell O.,"Palm Beach Gardens, FL",61,45,59,1.0,8/19/2013,"Substandard. Just found a huge piece of sharp plastic in my salad. Chinese chicken salad used to be my favorite there but lately each time I order it it is missing something from the times before. No nuts, sesame seeds or rice noodles this time. Just plastic. This place sucks."
Courtland T.,"Manhattan, NY",27,15,5,3.0,8/6/2013,"It's hard to enjoy your meal when a spoon or fork drops every five minutes ... from the hands of the staff. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt, since most of the staff looks about 20 and is semi-cute.  Regardless of the unnecessary noise, there was only a 10-15 minute wait on a busy Friday, which is nice. The mac-n-cheese burger was surprisingly good, as well as the buffalo shrimp. I wish their menu was condensed; there's much too much on there.  My waitress was a bit rude towards the end of the evening when she checked my table's individual bills to make sure we paid ... while she was at the table. But, like I said, the entire staff is probably no older than I am and can't be faulted for their naivety. Here's to hoping they learn the right skills to move onto their next serving job. Let's hope they don't serve me there."
Sunshine G.,"Jupiter, FL",4,31,2,1.0,7/21/2014,"Service is terrible. Waitstaff is extremely rude. Waited 20 minutes for drinks, waited 20 minutes just to place and order for our kids food. The waiter was beyond rude and very disrespectful."
Raj S.,"New Haven, CT",2,26,10,4.0,9/20/2014,Busy time the service is poor. All other times it's great. Food is always delicious. Regardless I will always come back here.
Rachel M.,"West Palm Beach, FL",4,81,26,4.0,12/9/2014,"Usually a wait so plan ahead! Food is good, huge menu. Get the Mac N Cheese Balls! Full bar as well. Casual."
sonia v.,"Northridge, CA",28,64,,2.0,11/30/2015,"This place just has too much on menu to make their food good. Had the pasta with shrimp asparagus mushrooms in a white sauce. Told the waiter pasta was over cooked and he just ignored me... WTF. That's cool, won't go back again"
David B.,"Palm Beach Gardens, FL",0,34,26,4.0,7/10/2011,Somewhat pricey and often loud you just can't beat The Cheesecake Factory. Very diverse menu and everything I've ever tried has been a winner. Desserts are fabulous. Service has always been good for me at this location. Always clean and good AC. Can definitely recommmend.
Vanessa S.,"Franklin Square, NY",14,10,1,2.0,10/7/2014,"Predicable but bland on every level. Dined here on an off season weeknight and was seated promptly. Great service by the waiter, but the food was less than memorable. Fettuccine Alfredo was bland and required several servings of grated cheese to make it palatable. Cheesecake was served nearly frozen. I'm glad we used a gift card card for this disappointment meal."
Patty W.,"Lake Worth, FL",280,1063,1750,4.0,5/15/2012,"The food and cheesecake is always worth coming here.  Whether it's in PGA, Cityplace, Boca, or anywhere else, the service never fails to amaze me.  We sat outside and the breeze kept us comfortable.  The menu is always hard to choose from since I want everything on there.  I settled for the meatloaf, mashed potatoes, and corn succotash from the lunch portion.  Oh, so good!  In fact, I had enough to take home for leftovers.  I didn't want to overstuff myself with too much food because I wanted cheesecake.  Duh!  Again, another hard one to pick from.  The white chocolate caramel macadamia nut cheesecake was screaming my name.  I brought back like a couple bites home.  It was insane how I couldn't finish it since I barely made it to the finish line.  Oh well, I'm not complaining about leftovers.  Kudos to our waitress that took care of all of us for the Mother's Day pregathering.  She was professional and recommended some of her favorite items off of the menu while we were ordering.  The visit is always an enjoyable one, no matter which one I land up at.  Thanks Cheesecake Factory!"
Julie M.,"Boynton Beach, FL",2,7,1,5.0,5/4/2014,Mother's Day opening and 9am!   Call to make reservations for your Mother's Day Brunch!
B H.,"San Clemente, CA",3,2,,2.0,8/23/2014,"Pretty disappointing experience overall. Some errors from the kitchen and the service staff.  The largest disappointment was the food. It was very bland and average. Certainly not on par with an $18.00 per plate price.  I have had great experiences at other Cheesecake Factory locations, but I have to say that this one should be placed on your veto list."
Kyme R.,"North Palm Beach, FL",67,37,30,4.0,1/28/2013,"I gave it 4-stars because I believe that the Cheesecake Factory always gives you a consistent meal with plenty of options.  The PBG location has ample outside seating so if your open to enjoying the Florida weather, it eliminates any wait time. Since the portions are always so large, I always recommend splitting an appetizer, meal and dessert.  If not, you'll be too full for the yummy Cheesecake. This time we had the Sausage & Ricotta Flatbread.  Not one of my favorites.  I felt like it needed Red Sauce which they were happy to provide on the side for me.  For the entree I order the Combination Chicken Madeira & Steak Diane.  It's nothing crazy but always good and I was craving Steak.   Once again, I ended up too full for Cheesecake but I have to say that my new favorite is Red Velvet Cheesecake.  I'm not a fan of the actual cake but the Cheesecake is amazing there!  It's worth the trip just for that!"
Maria S.,"Jupiter, FL",1,13,1,5.0,12/31/2013,I love this place and have always had a good experience...they even get my super picky husband's order correct everytime!
Tom C.,"Vero Beach, FL",106,49,13,4.0,1/11/2014,"This place seems like a cliche now thanks to The Big Bang Theory, but they still have an amazing wasabi crushed tuna!"
Paul W.,"Palm Beach Gardens, FL",0,7,,3.0,4/28/2016,"Cheesecake factory has a lot to choose from on the menu....sometimes too hard to choose from. I came here for dinner with the family of six. The wait was an hour...typical waiting time for dinner at the restaurant. We were seated outside (first seating available) and luckily it was a nice night out. Waitress was friendly and professional throughout the service. The food was decent and cheesecake was delicious. It seemed to be going well until towards the end of the meal. I had noticed she asked everyone if they wanted refills on their drinks, except my wife's tea. I don't know if it's a policy to only have one cup per meal allowed, but the waitress should have at least asked. The check took a good 15 minutes to obtain and once we had given her the credit card, it took another 15 minutes to get it back. I would still come back to the restaurant but hopefully they are more steady with the service."
Brooks A.,"Miami Beach, FL",16,100,,4.0,8/13/2013,"Classic Cheesecake Factory food. It's delicious and there's always enough items on the menu to satisfy almost any craving. I've never had anything but great service here and I can't remember the last time my food wasn't tasty. Doggy bags are almost a necessity at the Cheesecake Factory, unless you haven't eaten all day."
Charles B.,"Palm Beach, FL",1,9,3,3.0,3/30/2014,One of our favorite places.  But today the service is painfully slow.   Food is consistently good.
Kristina M.,"Boynton Beach, FL",91,79,2,5.0,4/29/2011,"Out of all the Cheesecake Factory(s) in the US, I stumble upon one in FL. The area seems to be brand spanking new, nothing but positive feelings about it.  I hear great things about CF, and I was willing to check it out. Found myself in time for the lunch special. Not a big difference from any other time but still a difference. Appetizers - Crispy Artichoke hearts and the Arugula salad. My entree I had Herb crusted salmon and it was amazing.  Our server, Juan - very attentive. He was also very new but also very polite. Very good service. You have to have cheesecake from CF, right? I ordered the vanilla raspberry something something  - and the only thing that got me was that it had ladyfingers in it. Very Filling. Maybe too thick that I had to get coffee but I was already too stuffed from the meal.  I ordered a Caramel Macchiato and I burnt my tongue because it was served in a regular transparent glass. Confused me. Ticked me off actually - when I was expecting some kind of mug. The coffee was good and strong. The decor felt fresh and everything was very clean. The pricing shocked me because for the amount of food I ordered, I would've paid a lot more. Yay for lunch specials!"
