Matt R.,"West Palm Beach, FL",3,16,,4.0,3/19/2015,"They put out a consistent product and my wife always orders the shepards pie, which they took of the menu but still make by request.  I usually have a salad, and thy are huge!  Reasonably priced.  And then there is the assortment of cheesecake, we're usually so full, that we just split on and call it a night."
Amy V.,"Vail, CO",3,23,1,5.0,11/21/2013,"Having just moved here, we've dined at so many places.  Some pretty high end establishments (capital grill, j Alexander's). ...which were horribly disappointing.  We had dined at PBG Cheesecake factory in July and it was flawless.  We decided to go back for a guaranteed good meal and it didn't disappoint."
Karina P.,"West Palm Beach, FL",132,22,14,4.0,8/20/2013,Excellent Service and awesome food. Chicken costoletta is one of my favorite dishes they have! Sometimes the wait is long but its totally worth it! Recommend it to everyone!
Alan M.,"Jupiter, FL",0,7,2,4.0,12/4/2014,"Always a winner, can't go wrong with Cheesecake Factory. I had the ribeye which was a lot fattier than usual. My wife had the fillet which was excellent. Never had a bad experience here, service is excellent."
Luis K.,"Duluth, GA",0,24,,4.0,1/30/2013,Friendly staff and a great consistent meal.  I had their salmon salad that was well seasoned and very well portioned.
Andre F.,"Brooklyn, NY",62,21,2,4.0,1/11/2013,"Great food , Good drinks, Great Service. Only one complaint.. the menu is massive lol. There is a lot to choose from.  I ordered for starters the Tex Mex Egg rolls and a chicken dish for the main course. Both were tasty. I forgot to mention the bread... fresh and hot.  Between the appetizer and bread I was partially stuffed by the time the food came. Ate about half and packed the rest to go. All and all if your looking for Good food to satisfy any taste and Good Atmosphere you can't go wrong here."
Brett S.,"West Palm Beach, FL",0,142,,4.0,8/24/2011,"We just came back after being away for the summer and discovered they have a new ""Skinnidelicious Menu"". This is a fairly complex menu with many choices all below 590 calories. I had the Chopped chicken salad with a very tangy vinagret dressing that was delicious. I also had the unsweetened green tea with wintergreen which I enjoyed. My wife had a Turkey advocate sandwich that came with a nice salad. All below 590 calories. This is the first restaurant to provide such calorie mini ing dish's and we truly appreciated. And no, we skipped the cheesecake!"
Elle D.,"West Palm Beach, FL",3,57,6,4.0,12/8/2012,"Whenever I can't decide where to go eat, I always wind up here. Love the Thai chicken lettuce wraps!! Seriously, so good.   Reasonably priced and lots of food you can share."
Mike E.,"Miami, FL",76,97,5,2.0,8/7/2012,Cajun Chicken littles with blue-cheese dressing on the side...best option on the menu.
Jamison E.,"Parrish, FL",72,100,81,4.0,5/19/2012,The menu is so large its almost overwhelming.  I ate at the bar and had wings (ask for more sauce on the side) and a very generous size caesar salad.  The employees were all very gracious and helpful.  I would return.
Sharon G.,"Palm Beach Gardens, FL",7,7,,4.0,1/28/2013,"A go to place to get a little taste of everything. They have a huge menu! It's in a great location (Downtown at the Gardens) and very close to the movie theatre, shops etc. On a sunny day it's nice to sit on the patio and indulge a little. I had a cheeseburger and it was cooked to perfection! I left feeling full and relaxed. Not a bad way to enjoy a Saturday afternoon in sunny Florida!"
Adam S.,"Charlotte, NC",15,361,3,4.0,1/21/2012,"Cheesecake is really what you make of it. It can be delicious, such as my half Steak Dianne and half salmon, or fattening and heavy, like my dad's pasta. We ordered guacamole to start, and it was absolutely delicious, I must have had half of the chips alone. Salsa was also very good and mild (you can choose if you want it mild or spicy). In serving our meals, one od the servers (not our guy) actually whacked my mom on the head with her elbow and did not apologize. That's very unacceptable. My meal was half of the lemon salmon and half of Steak Dianne and some mashed. The steak was delicious, and the sauce had bitter and sweet notes. The salmon was above average, I just wished there was a little more crunch on the outside. My dad's fettucini was heavy and he didn't eat much of it, which doesn't happen a lot. My mom and sister also got pasta, which they reported was very good. Cheesecake at Cheesecake Factory is always good, however I didn't love the Reese's, so I might just stick to Red Velvet next time. Service was good, the friendly waiter talked to my dad about SUNY. Overall, I would probably go back if visiting the area."
Jake z.,"West Palm Beach, FL",286,80,11,3.0,1/22/2012,Excellent concept but only successfully pulls it off about half the time.
Kristen R.,"Sumter, SC",73,142,171,5.0,7/31/2011,"The Cheesecake Factory never lets me down! Fast and super friendly service. This location is not as busy as other locations which is a plus. Outside seating is nice when the weather is cool. Big bar. HUGE menu, great for groups because there really is something for everyone. Brunch on Sundays. Awesome cheesecake!! Try the chocolate coconut cheese cake!!"
Bruce G.,"Jupiter, FL",2,103,,4.0,8/16/2011,We went on a Friday night. The place was busy as usual. There were three in our group; two ordered the burgers and one had a salad. As usual the quality of the food was there and I had a burger with pork belly and a fried egg on top. Excellent tasting. My son really enjoyed his salad and my wife enjoyed her burger. I ordered medium rare and it was prepared that way. I agree with others that it is above average on the loudness scale. Our server was friendly and attentive. I'll go back.
Tracey E.,"Jupiter, FL",13,31,,2.0,9/19/2011,Lousy service and have sent things back nearly every time we've gone. City Place is better
Gary A.,"West Palm Beach, FL",7,40,7,3.0,5/8/2011,"I have been to CF before plenty of times, but decided to take the family out for Mother's Day Brunch.  They didn't have a special menu or any specials.... same ole' thing.  Don't get me wrong, their food is great, but I just expected something more for this special day."
J B.,"Palm Beach Gardens, FL",0,16,,1.0,11/8/2014,"I've tried to dine at this Cheesecake Factory location twice. Once in August 2014 and again this evening. This location does not even come close to meeting standards I've come to know Cheesecake Factory for. Tonight, my husband and I did not receive our dinner after _50_ minutes of waiting. Even at the 30 minute mark when we asked about the status of our order, we still waited 10 more minutes without being served, and then asked for a manager. After nearly an hour, they still did not arrive with food, and comp-ed our drinks and we left hungry. Three months ago, I never even received water or met our server to put in a drink order until 10+ minutes passed and I had to ask for assistance. That evening, our dinner order was significantly delayed and I had to ask for the manager to get involved. I've never been in a Cheesecake Factory restaurant anywhere in the country that operates like this one. Generally I can't tell the difference between a ""CF""  restaurant in Seattle, compared to one in Denver, compared to one in even West Palm Beach because they follow the same standards and protocols for service and food quality. This one is terrible"
S H.,"Palm Beach Gardens, FL",1,3,,2.0,10/1/2012,"Their food is good.  That is not the problem.  The problem is that this particular restaurant will not allow you to order sushi (specifically, the tuna tartare) as take out.  Why?  It's not like we can't get it at Publix down the street, or whole foods next door...or any other restaurant that happens to serve sushi.  Absolutely absurd!"
