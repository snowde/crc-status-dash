Rosita A.,"Etobicoke, Canada",3,9,,3.0,12/27/2017,We like coming here because the food is good. But the service always feels very rushed at this location. It is also very loud and boisterous. Maybe not a bad thing. Also very expensive for what they give you.  A final point is how long it takes to get seated. It feels like begging. We can go next door to Crepevine and get better food for dinner and get a seat immediately.
Eric N.,"San Marcos, CA",0,1,,1.0,1/2/2018,"First of all, let me start off by saying that I LOVE Cheesecake Factory and have been to more than 15 locations. All of the ones that I've been to have pretty much had their stuff together and I can't say that I've ever had a really bad experience at any of them. However, this Cheesecake Factory was a whole different story. We walked in and the hosts and the people who were standing behind the Cheesecake counter were arguing with each other about something. Not a big deal, we thought. One of the hosts took us a a table and our server took our order. Then I started noticing that both the table to left and to the right of us were unhappy and asked our server to take some of the entrees back. Then one of our entrees came, the Shrimp Scampi, and it turned out to be very spicy. Now, I have ordered the Shrimp Scampi from Cheesecake Factory quite a few times and it is supposed to have a little kick to it but this one was drowned in red pepper. So, I told our server and asked to exchange it for a different pasta, and to my surprise, she just said okay and took it back. I wasn't expecting a big apology or anything like that, but the way she reacted and casually said ""okay"" made it seem like entrees coming out wrong is a very common occurrence here. Yikes! Later, we ended up ordering a cheesecake and she brought us a carrot cake instead, which I had to send back again! Throughout the entirety of the meal, I actually saw servers arguing with each other in plain view of customers (one server actually yelled ""ugh!"" and walked off). The food itself came out very slowly from the kitchen and honestly wasn't as good as other Cheesecake Factories. Lastly, when we were walking out, there were customers waiting to be seated but all 3 of the hosts were standing away from the counter and none of them attended to those customers. Finally, one of the girls from behind the Cheesecake counter walked over and yelled ""way to do your jobs, guys!"" at the Hosts and once again in plain view of customers!!!  Once again, I really do like Cheesecake Factory but it was incredibly surprising to see one function this poorly. Everyone from the Hosts, to the servers, to the kitchen didn't seem like they were very good at their jobs. Next time, I will probably be going to the location in Westfield Valley Fair rather than this one."
Nicole G.,"Union City, CA",183,316,470,2.0,12/26/2017,"Well I understand why this CCF is rated 2.5 stars. We came in 12/26 at 11am right when they open. Granted it's the day after Christmas so I understand people are still in holiday mode.  However, it was extremely slow and there were no other patrons until 11:30. We ordered our drinks at 11, bread came about 11:15. Then the wait. Our sever was nice and explained there was a large catering order that came in. I saw the GM walking around, he should've approached the tables and apologized for the delays.  When our food came at 11:40 (keep in mind it was just 2-3 other patrons) the flatbread came it was cold, took that back. The tamale corn cakes were cold too, but I was too hunger to wait. Thankfully the omelette was of temperature which came out 5 mins later. First and last time to this CCF Location.  Our waiter removed the coffee and soda as an apology which was greatly appreciated."
Michelle C.,"San Diego, CA",101,332,770,3.0,1/5/2018,"We came here on NYE, the restaurant is dark as usual. It doesn't bother me that it was dark, but the table and utensils were dirty. There was a piece of food on my knife. I didn't tell the waitress, just made sure I didn't use the knife. The food was way better at different locations, but after eating the bread and appetizer, I was already full. I asked the waitress if she can do something for me for my boyfriend's birthday. I ordered a piece of cheesecake at the end of our meal and they decorated it for me and signed him a birthday song."
Emi N.,"San Carlos, CA",307,233,1840,3.0,12/8/2017,"Cheesecake Factory's are pretty much all the same.  Same menu, same ambiance, same cheesecakes.  I can't complain about the food.  Portions are ridiculously huge.  The last time I went to CF in Palo Alto, our drinks and bread didn't arrive for at least 30 minutes.  Not even water.   After I ordered my entree, our server came back to say they were out of it.  (This dish consisted of pasta, chicken and sauce).  I asked what part they were actually out of but she didn't know and went to find out.  When she came back she said it was the sauce and that she asked her manager if they could make something else but that she had to go back to let him know right away because he was already putting in the order.  Wait, what?  It made no sense to me that she would rush me like that without giving me more than a second to think about it.  I didn't even know what the order was!  I said I wanted to keep looking at the menu and she seemed kind of annoyed because obviously she had done me some sort of a favor.  Anyway, she asked what I wanted and I told her I was in the mood for pasta but that I didn't like cream sauces.  She then suggested the carbonara (which is pretty creamy)...   Long story short, I ordered another pasta and it was fine.  Maybe she was just having an off night."
Umang D.,"Palo Alto, CA",20,74,332,1.0,12/8/2017,"I am writing an update, since I wanted to respond to the reply from Cheesecake Factory to my review. I do not consider this a fault on Doordash's part. They obviously delivered what was handed to them by Cheesecake Factory. The problem is 100% on Cheesecake factory who has no quality control and think it is ok to deliver what was basically a cheese bread  for $7 and a lump of lettuce and greens for $12 . And now I need to reach out to them to get this sorted out instead of them proactively acting on it. I already submitted my feedback on cheese cake's website 2 days back and am yet to hear anything from them."
Rachel W.,"Redwood City, CA",237,225,372,2.0,11/20/2017,"*** 2.5 Stars ***  Only bumped up for our server - he was witty and Scottish sounding, and funny for our family lol. My mom doesn't have a sense of humor but whatever. Came here Friday night, to a 20 minute wait. Found a few seats in the bar, and then quickly got called to a table. They don't transfer tickets, which is inconvenient for patrons, but we settled it and then went to go eat. We ordered appetizers at the same time as an entree; guacamole (mild), shrimp spring rolls, beet and goat cheese salad, and the lemon garlic shrimp pasta. He didn't ask us whether we wanted appetizers first, but something happened in the kitchen anyway. We waited 20 minutes before our server even came back to check on us, and we had to inquire about our food. As soon as he walked away, other runners came out with everything. Okay, what is the purpose of an appetizer then? We dug in, and wow. If we were coming here for overpriced, over AND under-seasoned mediocre food, we hit the jackpot! The guacamole was INCREDIBLY salty. I've never had guacamole that salty in my life. There we also huge pieces of cilantro stalk, which made it a little cumbersome to even get a bite. We told the server about the guac and he took it back, and off the bill, but WOAH. I absolutely don't recommend ordering this. It's like, the easiest dish to prepare and get right! He told us that they prepare it in the morning, and that it may have gotten saltier over the day. Really? They make one giant batch in the morning for the whole day? And THEN it took 20 minutes to throw on a plate?  Then, the Lemon and Garlic Shrimp Pasta was flavorless. We had asked in advance if it was particularly garlicy and he said no, we'd taste the lemon over the garlic. Honestly, it tasted like nothing. Butter and parsley (which was the garnish). How lame! The shrimp spring rolls were ok - I found them on the dry side, and the peanut sauce wasn't much of a help, since it was on the blander side as well. My beet and goat cheese salad was more green apple than anything. There were 5 tiny chunks of beet on the whole plate. Boo you guys. I've been to the Cheesecake Factory at Oakridge Mall plenty of times - that's how it should be done. Sorry Palo Alto, will NOT be back. We obviously skipped dessert. ** Edit ** In response to the Cheesecake Factory's reply - we didn't feel we had to escalate to a manager, since we informed our server. He took the guacamole off the bill, and if he felt that manager intervention was needed, he should have said something to one."
Anthony N.,"San Jose, CA",2,70,29,1.0,11/12/2017,"I want to like this place, but I just have to give up on it. I usually like TCF, but this location is a huge mess. Prepare for two hours for your lunch and to get the wrong food. For example, I just got Eggs Benedict and after 40 minutes was told that if I wanted poached eggs it would be at least another 30 minutes. My wife got a soggy salad. Apparently in their confusion over how to poach an egg, they let it sit there in the kitchen."
Emmylou R.,"Temecula, CA",63,67,170,5.0,11/26/2017,Always perfect! ordered their Skinnylicous Lemon Garlic Shrimp with Angel hair pasta  Perfect portion for a light dinner  But I ordered their famous Dulce de Leche Cheescake   and it's perfect ending to my dinner not too sweet just right
Sarahlynn C.,"San Jose, CA",1,8,2,1.0,12/23/2017,"I normally love Cheesecake Factory, but the only reason I'm giving 1 Star is that I didn't receive 2 of my items I had ordered through door dash. The receipt had two items crossed off (which were the ones I did receive) and the words ""need chicken"" written next to the items I didn't receive. Also, not a huge deal but I didn't get my utensils and complimentary bread that I asked for. I hope that this review catches their attention and somehow this issue can be resolved"
Jacqueline S.,"Menlo Park, CA",84,53,27,3.0,9/2/2017,"Went here on a Saturday night and it wasn't as crowded as I anticipated. My group of four was seated within ten minutes. However once we were seated it seemed like they may have been short staffed. Our waiter was hard to find and our waters were not refilled until maybe an hour into the meal. Our food took a bit as well and my sister's salad had to be sent back, because it had tomatoes (when she asked for no tomatoes). The manager was very nice, but it's especially hard to eat a meal when your water has not been refilled (and you've asked several times)."
Mary S.,"San Jose, CA",214,200,224,3.0,8/7/2017,"This Cheesecake Factory location in PA was pretty slow even during slow hours between 1-3 PM on a weekend. It took the server a while to bring our drinks and order our food. My fiance and I order our usual favorites. I had the Chicken Madera and he had the Miso Salmon.  The portions this time around seem smaller than what we were used to at the other locations. I'm not sure whether CCF have decided to cut it short on their portions since my fiance used to work at the CCF years ago. Chicken Madera, nonetheless, still tastes great. I just wished portions were larger."
Pooja G.,"Newark, CA",0,3,2,1.0,1/5/2018,Extremely serious. We ordered California Guacamole Salad and they gave us salad with raw chicken in it. Being a vegetarian it is serious issue for me. How can they do it? It was not some dish where I asked him to customize it to remove chicken and they forgot. We were three people and ordered all vegetarian dishes. Even we confirmed with waiter to make sure it do not have eggs also while ordering our dishes and they gave us chicken.
Maria F.,"Menlo Park, CA",22,43,14,1.0,12/26/2017,We arrived at 805pm and had our order taken by 830 at 915 the manager came to our table and apologized they were making our food at 930 we left without eating or any reason for not preparing our 7 orders.  Paid for only one round of drinks and they forgot to bring the lemon drop martini  so I walked to the bar and ordered it after 45 min I have been to the cheesecake monthly for client lunches and this was the worst experience we have ever had.  The manager offered to bring us more bread and not comp the meals so we would wait even longer for them as they prepared our order immediately.
Stephanie W.,"Mountain View, CA",82,189,180,5.0,5/7/2017,"I never thought there is low Calories dish in this restaurant, but since I m on diet, I got the Seared Tuna salad, delicious and healthy, 600 Calories. My friend got Kobe beef slider, with cooked onion and mushroom; yummy too. The Tiramisu cheesecake was luscious, even better than Tiramisu, since the cheesecake adds a little sour to balance the sweet, try it, you will love it. The African American server was polite and professional, even wrote a ""Thank you"" on the receipt. I enjoyed it a lot."
Trang P.,"Newark, CA",0,10,5,2.0,1/3/2018,"Food is consistent with other cheesecake factories, but it is SLOW. Spent about 2 hours here and I just came for dessert, there was also hardly anyone in the restaurant."
Ruthie G.,"San Jose, CA",534,73,48,3.0,12/31/2017,"Service: 5 stars. Portion size of appetizer salad: 5 stars. Bread: 5 stars. Carne Asada medallions: 4 stars. Jambalaya: 1 Star (watery, flavorless noodles). Greasy, slippery bar floor: hazardous, 1 Star."
Patricia C.,"La Mirada, CA",63,357,369,3.0,11/28/2017,"This Cheesecake Factory location was a bit disappointing because of the service. Our waitress was taking her sweet sweet time to do everything and she seemed very inefficient with the way she kept walking back and forth doing one thing at a time... We were waiting for a long time for our drinks, then our food, then drink refills, then our check... Even the food didn't seem hot and perhaps it was because she let it sit on the counter for a while before bringing it out to us? I'm not sure if it was just an off day but the place was practically empty, yet the service was slow as ever."
Tuncer E.,"El Grao de Castellón, Spain",4,6,2,5.0,10/15/2017,We all love that Egyptian decoration place. You do not need to wait so long like SF. Cheesecake is great. But we love burgers.
Joseph V.,"Mountain View, CA",0,29,,1.0,11/4/2017,"Takeout orders will get delayed/pushed back one and a half hours. During busy dinners, have seen all hostesses/hosts/pickup people/supervisors leave the lobby empty. Like 8:30pm, families and couples walking in with absolutely nobody to greet them. Maybe they got put on the cook line to help with the backed up kitchen?  Just absolutely inept from top to bottom and never once offered any type of way to make things right."
Armand F.,"Mountain View, CA",282,72,116,5.0,3/13/2017,"I don't care what people say, Cheesecake Factory is damn delicious. Gimme those giant portions any day, leave the $14 avocado toast to the ""sophisticated"".  This time around I got the Parmesan Crusted Chicken. Holy crap, this was good. Literally a layer of Parmesan goodness on top of a generous portion of chicken.  Finished off with a lemon raspberry cheesecake, which I'd put in my top 3 favorite flavors now. It's lighter, but not too light. I'd take it over red velvet / Oreo most days. #cantjudgethiscarnivore"
Carol M.,"Palo Alto, CA",0,40,5,3.0,1/2/2018,TYPICAL.  GREAT MENU.   Family friendly. Fun. Good service.    Music is sometimes too loud. Great for happy hour. Nice bathrooms.
Adaeze E.,"Sunnyvale, CA",10,87,150,3.0,5/6/2017,"The only reason I usually come here is for the Hershey's chocolate bar cheesecake. It's fantastic! I usually come here for desert and tea with friends after having dinner some place else. I like that they close relatively late - it makes for ample time to talk, relax and enjoy the dessert.  The service varies from visit to visit so I never know what to expect- that I don't like. But for the Hershey's chocolate bar cheesecake, I'll be back!"
riottgirl o.,"San Francisco, CA",2,64,4,3.0,10/20/2017,"The host at this location is an ass.  My friend and I were walked to a table for lunch.  We preferred a booth (many were available).  The host give us a condescending look when we requested the booth instead and told us we would need to walk back to the front of the restaurant in order to change seats.  Why?  I told him, we will wait here at this table and you can walk back to the front of the restaurant to do whatever it is you need to do to move us to a booth.  Keep in mind, this was a Saturday about 2 or 3P--not crowded.  So, we waited at that table for him to come back--since that's what he said to do.  He never came back.  If it wasn't for the waiter who moved us (who wasn't even working in that section) god knows how long we would have waited for the idiot host to return.   Our waiter was very nice.  The food was average. The host is an asshole."
Karen K.,"San Francisco, CA",187,66,451,2.0,10/19/2017,"This review will primarily focus on the lack of quality in service at this particular location of this chain restaurant. If I were to rate the restaurant solely on its service (or lack thereof), I would be rating this location with one star. Not that the food was great--there was an onion peel (the very exterior layer) in the burrito. My waiter, Roger, was the only staff member I interacted with, so I am assessing this restaurant's service on the basis of his performance, assuming that the staff are trained to represent the chain well. The reason why I found myself at the Cheesecake Factory in the first place was because a friend of mine had been furiously craving an appetizer of deep-fried mac & cheese balls, and I was accompanying her. Turns out the only incentive (the mac & cheese balls) for us to be there in the first place was nonexistent--they had run out. (This was 6:30 pm.) After my friend expressed how bummed out she was, Roger explained that it was a popular item and asked her why she hadn't come earlier.  I see a problem in this question. I think that it's inevitable for a restaurant to be out of stock of certain items, but, personally, think it's unreasonable for a waiter to ask a diner why she didn't arrive earlier so that she could order this item, especially five hours before the restaurant's closing time. Roger offered an alternative--regular mac & cheese, and my friend ordered it, along with our other food orders. Allow me to note here that Roger was not writing anything down, but said, 'Yeah, I'll put that order in for you.' Later, after some other food items arrived, my friend asked Roger if her mac & cheese was on its way. Roger proceeded to deny that she had ordered the mac & cheese. He said, 'You never ordered that.'  I see two problems here. First, Roger has no solid evidence to assert that she never ordered the mac & cheese, considering he wrote nothing down, as well as the fact that there were two others (the third member of my party and me) that witnessed my friend ordering the mac & cheese. The second problem lies in Roger's failure to follow the norms for waiting staff. For the sake of argument, let's say that my friend did not order the mac & cheese. Even in this case, Roger should apologize for the mistake and promise to get it right away if he were a 'good' waiter in the orthodox sense of the phrase.  The above problems can be summarized by Roger's inability to recognize and/or attempt to compensate for his inabilities. Aside from the mac & cheese problem, he forgot other things that we asked for, i.e. boxes. He failed to bring the proper number of menus and failed to bring dessert silverware with or before the arrival of the dessert. I doubt I will ever find myself at this/a Cheesecake Factory ever again, but in the event that I do, I hope that my waiter or waitress is more qualified."
Adam S.,"San Diego, CA",1644,761,174,4.0,10/11/2017,"I have never been to a Cheesecake Factory that looked bad. Although this location is a bit smaller than others I have been to, the expeerience is still the same. If you never heard or been to a CF,  then definitely go. One of very few places where a huge menu produces great quality food. Simply put, the value you get here is great. What really made this location stand out in my mind was the service. Grade A in my opinion and really was what I expect when going to a place where I am about to spend $50 per person. On top of cleanliness and atmosphere, there is really is nothing wrong with this place. Overall, Cheesecake Factory is always a good bet and if you are in the mood for a good meal and time, I definitely recommend coming here."
Yoni L.,"Sunnyvale, CA",0,2,,2.0,12/29/2017,"Food pretty good, the kids were happy with their tenders and burgers and we had a few appetizers but the service is very very slow. Not coming back again."
Claudel M.,"San Francisco, CA",31,14,,1.0,11/30/2017,The cheesecake factory was my favorite place to go for happy hour until yesterday. I ordered a cheeseburger and it came out with a burger split in half and a bite taken out of each half when it should have been 2 double patties. I showed the bartender Robert and he was so discustedhe called the manager and I showed the people at the bar and it turned out they had the same . It seemed as thou a crack head was in the kitchen and the manager was like well do you want another burger??????? I said are you kiddin me and no . Whatever crack head you have in that kitchen is not making me another meal he would probably spit on it. WELL it turns out he did this to 3 other customers . So I called corporate and they offered me a $15 gift card .  ARE YOU KIDDING ME  KEEP IT IF THAT'S THE BEST YOU CAN OFFER TO A LOYAL CUSTOMER. I'VE OWNED SEVERAL REST AND OUR CUTOMERS WERE THE MOST VALUABLE  IN THE WORLD AND WITHOUT THIER LOYALTY  WE SIMPLY WOULD NOT EXIST. I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED AND WILL WRITE A LETTER ATTACHED WITH 3 OTHER CUSTOMERS TO THE CORPORATE OFFICE.
Bill L.,"Mountain View, CA",0,1,,2.0,12/8/2017,"Very poor service here; seated at a small table @5:45pm, asked for a switch, made our order, sat for 25 minutes with no waiter/waitress come by. Stopped someone for more water for both of us, came back, placed only one cup and walked away. Waited for the food for another 15 minutes. Asked THREE workers for the manager. Another 5 minutes went by, one of the managers brought our order to us. The pasta was all stuck together; the prepared food was seating there for a long time. The manager came by at the end to apologize for the miscommunication among his workers, gave us a dessert ( on the house). Will NOT come back for a while."
Ken A.,"Redwood City, CA",18,133,267,2.0,4/18/2017,"The only reason we went here was because people have been giving us gift cards for this place for years. We finally broke down and went. Fried food bonanza! Some healthy choices - I tried to order the grilled artichoke, they did not have it. Service was horrible, I actually had to flag workers down and hand them plates to clear our table - after appetizers and after dinner. Waiter jumped into our conversation - really! The kids don't care so I am glad we had six of the with us. Still have some gift cards left...ugh"
Aaron V.,"South San Francisco, CA",4,23,6,3.0,11/6/2017,"Place was decent, it was pretty packed when I walked in and the guy forgot to take my name. They were still able to seat me pretty quick. The lighting was dark, it might be good for date night but I was just with friends. The desert menu is great if your looking for a place to turn down."
KC C.,"Los Gatos, CA",5,118,1,1.0,11/20/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory must not have a standard restaurant wide list of expectations for their staff.  I go to the one at Valley Fair quite often, and I have never had such rude service.  I go to Palo Alto location on University ONCE and I'm already turned off.   Let me start by saying I am a pretty reasonable patron.  I get it....it was a Saturday night and there are no reservations so our party of 12 was quoted a 45 min wait.  After 60 minutes, I inquired how much longer it would be and one of the hosts, Adrian, said they were doing their best to get our table ready, and that they were just waiting for guests to leave.  At this point, they were already 15 minutes over the quoted wait time but we understood that we had a large party and that it was a Saturday night.  Another 15 minutes had passed and I inquired again, AFTER I had taken a walk around the restaurant.  I mentioned to Adrian that there was a set of five tables that could be pushed together and then also the people that he said they were waiting on to leave, they were all just sitting there on their iphones.  He looked at me like I was the one with the problem and said the same thing, but this time, he didn't apologize, nor did he even look me in the eye.  Instead, he turned to the next person and pretty much just disregarded me.  So now I'm really annoyed.  At this point there was nothing I could do but wait; but what I wanted to do was smack that smirk off his face.  15 minutes later, 45 minutes AFTER the initial quote time of 45 minutes, for a total of 1  1/2 hours, the other hostess, Patricia, seated us and profusely apologized.  I told her I understand the situation, but what made me angry was the way he just disregarded me, like 'here she comes again....let's just throw her a bone and say the same thing so I can get her off my back' is what I felt like he was thinking.  I was appalled at his behavior.   In fact, he did the same thing to a couple that was waiting longer than quoted but they were smart and LEFT.  I on the other hand had hungry children and stayed bc I THOUGHT I was going to be seated by the original quote time.  On a good note and the ONLY reason why this rating warrants even one star, is bc our server Vanessa was great!   There is a reason why this place has 2  1/2 stars....need I say more?"
Vineet J.,"Redwood City, CA",52,41,14,1.0,11/22/2017,This place has the worst service of any Cheesecake Factory I have ever been to. Food is comparable to the other chain locations (which I usually like) but this place has waiters that don't take down the locations of foods/drinks for large parties and bring out items for parties with long delays in the middle. Not sure if 2 of us are supposed to start eating or wait 20 min for everyone else to get their food.
S R.,"Palo Alto, CA",58,34,16,1.0,11/12/2017,I have been coming here for years. It's common knowledge that this place has slow service but this visit was it really was over the top. All I ordered was grilled cheese. It took an hour for me to get my food. When I got it it was not made to order and it was cold. My soda was also flat. So fed up with this location. I wont be returning.
Justin D.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",74,11,,2.0,11/11/2017,Seriously. What is up with the service in this location? Very unfriendly staff.. almost as if we were being shunned and were a bother. Bartenders seemed more concerned about cleaning up and getting out of there than serving us even though the restaurant didn't close for another 3 hours.  Def won't be back to this location.
Swati A.,"San Jose, CA",1,12,5,3.0,6/3/2017,"Ambience: Good Food: The Cheesecakes are super yummy-licious. Chocolate Mousse Cheescake, White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle, Hershey's Chocolate Bar Cheesecake are some of the cheesecakes that I have tried and absolutely looveeee :* Their regular food/meals however are OKish. They look more delicious that they taste. A colleague had ordered a vegetarian pasta but the pasta was not cooked very well Service: Ok. This is mainly due to the wait time which is Horrible! If you are visiting a Cheesecake be prepared to wait for someone to take your order, get the food, get the bill, collect your card and get it back for signing. Basically be prepared to wait for every single thing for which you interact with the staff Price: A little pricy for the Ok food that is served Overall: Ok. Their Cheesecakes are a MUST try, I wouldn't recommend the food"
Michael W.,"Honolulu, HI",428,285,522,4.0,11/23/2016,"I came here for an impromptu lunch yesterday. It was fairly empty since it was almost 2pm. I was seated quickly and was able to get my food and finish before 2:30. I got the Louisiana chicken pasta and it was amazing! The sauce was rich, spicy, and had the Cajun flavors I expected. The chicken was a breast deep fried. Breaking was nice and crispy. It tasted very good too. The down side of the dish was that I can feel the fat in the dish. It was so rich, I was full after half the plate. I still finished it but had regrets for the next few hours.  The waitress I had was super nice. Took really good care of me and always had a smile on her face. Couldn't complain about the service. It was pretty good. I was sad I was too full for dessert though. Maybe next time."
Scott G.,"Sheridan, OR",1,48,77,3.0,10/11/2017,The food is pretty good. I like that they have a Skinnylicious menu with low calorie fare. The only problem with this specific location  (and I've now been here for a lunch and a dinner 3 months apart) is that both times I waited 45 minutes to get my food. In both instances my server was very apologetic. It obviously is not the waiter's fault.
Oded M.,"Mountain View, CA",0,2,,1.0,8/17/2017,"DON'T GO TO THIS RESTAURANT the food was stale and took forever to come. We were 6 adults with 3 children (3,2,2). The place looked nice, but it took forever (over 15 minutes) to get a table (even though the place was definitely not full). We ordered the children dishes first which was nice, but then it all went down hill. one person ordered a the ""cheesecake sandwich""  only to be notified 15 minutes later that ""it has run out"", we proceeded to order a second dish, which had also ""ran out""... we repeatedly asked to get the dishes as they are ready because we were with small children and in a hurry but we got the dishes only AN HOUR AFTER WE ORDERED, at which point the children had already finished eating and it was already too late. the manager came up to us and didn't even apologize but only said something in the line that the kitchen staff will be dealt with."

We wanted to avoid a noisy crowds at the local Palo Alto pubs and searching for where to have drinks and small plates. Found an open parking in front of here and it was perfect! I'd come here just for drinks. We sat at the bar area. Immediately got seated and started! Menu, bread, drinks and appetizers all started rolling out in less than 10mins. I will seriously now consider having meals at the bar area. Much quicker and attentive staff here versus the main dining where it's always crowded and you're often left wondering when the waiter is coming back!  That classic cheesecake factory bread is everything!  Flat bread - mozarella, tomato and basil on a thin crust,  a bit on greasy side.  Crab bites - should be renamed crab balls is mediocre. My friend liked it the most.  Spring rolls - good not the best. The roll could have been tighter. You have to adjust your grip on it after a first bite. It came with 2 dipping sauce - we started with the soy sauce based one. Edamame - a good snack in between convos Red Sangria - we ordered the white sangria but they were out of it so we settled for the red Hot Tea - they bring a box of tea for you to choose. A good variety.  Salted Caramel Cheesecake - very rich and decadent dessert. A delicious sinful pleasure on a Saturday evening. Total: $68"
