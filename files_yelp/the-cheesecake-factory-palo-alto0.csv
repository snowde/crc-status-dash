Thomas J.,"Palo Alto, CA",0,13,3,1.0,12/29/2016,Absolutely a totally awful experience. 3 people for dinner. Was told there was a 25-30 min wait. And we were OK with that. But the wait was actually 50min. 1st waiter came in fast and took our drinks order. After 20min we asked another waiter about our order. He could not locate 1st waiter and proceeded to take our food order. About 15min later (35min total) 1st waiter appeared with drinks order. And did not bring everything we ordered! 3rd waiter appeared 15 min later and said that they did not ha e a food order for our table. She did excuse the situation but then took the food order again. Now we have waited another 25min and still don't have the food or all the drinks! Just gave them 5min to fix or we are leaving. Wow food appeared within 1min of leaving. Not all 3 dishes though. What a crappy place. Stay away.
Katie G.,"Carlsbad, CA",60,103,134,5.0,1/23/2016,"Cheesecake Factory never fails to satisfy. We came in with a large group on a weekend, and our service was efficient and friendly. I wish they took weekend reservations, but it still worked out.  The menu is extensive and has a ton of extensive options, there is something delicious to eat for everyone! Also the complimentary bread is the best, and the dessert is the best around."
Ayca S.,"Sunnyvale, CA",0,8,8,1.0,1/7/2017,"This restaurant put an end to my Cheesecake Factory visits. I ordered a crispy chicken costoletta and waited for half an hour for it. It came out so ridiculously salty I had to return it. The manager told me that it indeed was too salty because they changed their salt type and that they will make another one for me. After another half an hour wait I had to tell them that my baby was becoming uneasy and I have to have it to go. When I opened the package at home, the chicken was burnt and it was obvious that it was cooked on a pan that was used to cooked another dish. There were burnt pasta pieces(two different types of pasta btw) on it, and there was a sweet taste to the chicken which should not exist in the order I had (it was from the sauce of another dish). I am disgusted by the food I received. Apparently not only they do not care about the food they prepare, they also do not care about using clean pans.I am glad I do not have allergies because  who knows what was cooked on that pan before they made my food. Never going back."
Alphonzo B.,"Oakley, CA",109,10,10,2.0,1/23/2016,Service was TerRiBle! 44 minutes to receive our dinner for 4. Sadly they brought the wrong pasta plate and then my wife plate was prepared wrong.  My daughter's meal was last and it came out in halves....salmon and broccoli came first.  Now check this Sh**.... the pasta for my daughter was ordered with Alfredo sauce. ...why the hell she come out with dry as pasta (no sauce). I wanted to strangle her azz. Got my daughter sitting here with dry azz pasta..she said some people do not want sauce!! Take that shit back. Stay away yall. I have more but that's enough.
Fernando S.,"Palo Alto, CA",0,2,4,1.0,7/26/2015,It's My First Time In This Restaurant! The customer Service. Is Really Bad I'm Wait 1 Hour For The Food ! And The Food Is Really Bad !! I Never Come Back Again To This Restaurant !! I really  Dont recommend this restaurant.i was very upset the way the server helped us !!
Robert Q.,"Walnut, CA",28,16,1,3.0,10/14/2015,"Great interior, service was satisfactory. Food: garlic noodles + shrimp.  I hoped the shrimp would be grilled and on a side skewer, but the shrimp was cut up and mixed with the noodles.  Noodles are A1 though. Mini corn dogs are a must!!!"
Ziyan C.,"San Francisco, CA",81,1838,8185,3.0,1/28/2015,"There was a large group from work doing a lunch and we figured the only place where there wouldn't be much wait was the Cheesecake Factory (especially after trying a couple other spots). It was about 12:30pm on a Friday - granted, peak lunch time - and it was about a 20 minute wait. But when we were sat, we were in a completely empty section! That just seemed odd to us. Service was fine, we all enjoyed a meal together. My only other complaint was with my Herb Crusted Salmon Salad. This wasn't really a Salmon Salad. This was more like a really basic salad with a couple pieces of salmon next to it. This was very lackluster and I really wish I'd ordered something else!"
Nitin A.,"San Jose, CA",84,49,63,4.0,8/23/2016,One of my favorite Cheesecake branches!  Chicken Marsala is great here. Cocktails aren't very good. Food and service is pretty awesome.
Jeremy H.,"Stanford, CA",3,50,,1.0,7/20/2015,"Vegetarians, beware! Coming out of a mini Yelp retirement to comment on my experiences this past weekend. On Saturday night, a large group of us (12, to be precise) came to The Cheesecake Factory around 9:30 PM after a concert at Stanford. It took us 30 mins or so to be seated even though there were plenty of seats (we think they didn't have enough servers for the restaurant).  After we got seated, I ordered the avocado, mushroom, and zucchini fries. I asked our server (who was very friendly) what the soup of the day was, and after she told me it was chicken soup, I replied that I would stick with the vegetable fries since I'm vegetarian. Our food came some 20 minutes later. I was halfway through my ""fries"" - basically breaded and fried pieces of vegetables - when I bit into one, and had an unfamiliar taste and texture. I examined it carefully, and it most definitely was NOT a vegetable. It was impossible to tell before biting into it because the breaded pieces of zucchini and avocado were opaque and not distinct, but a WHOLE PIECE of chicken had been fried and included in my food, and I had accidentally eaten half of the piece. I notified my server (mainly to let them know so that if there was a mix up, other people wouldn't have to go through this), who said that my dish should not have any meat, but took the other half of the piece of meat back to the kitchen to investigate. She came out five minutes later to inform me that it was, indeed, chicken - she told me the kitchen in the back was a ""huge mess"" (her words) and apparently the kitchen staff had messed up. She also commented that the manager or general manager had been notified. She was apologetic and friendly, and ended up comping this dish. However, I'm giving The Cheesecake Factory one star, given that their server self-admitted that their kitchen was a ""big mess"" and that I was served meat in what was supposed to be a vegetarian dish. I don't ask much of my restaurants, but I would like confidence in a clean kitchen that is able to serve the food that is ordered and be organized enough to ensure that meat does not get into vegetarian dishes. Admittedly, their cheesecake was really good, but I'm going to have to give one of my rare one-star reviews here because of my experiences."
Victoria M.,"Clearfield, UT",103,427,869,3.0,10/10/2014,"Located on the busy University Avenue strip - but not too congested as ALL of the locations in SJ usually are. I liked everything - as usual. Great service, food and cheesecake!"
Mae F.,"San Jose, CA",167,96,1,4.0,5/13/2016,"Food is good. I love the big entrees. It's close to my office so I go there for lunch sometimes. When I can't finish the meal, I just give the leftover to my kids for their school lunch the next day. My hunger and my job to make kids lunch are taken care of. This busy (lazy) mom approve!"
Beau L.,"Palo Alto, CA",54,2,,1.0,6/19/2016,"I have been to several Cheesecake Factory's before and usually service is very good. Unfortunately this branch has poor customer service and extremely long wait times for the food. The staff eventually told us that they were not staffed well, but it would have been nice to have a forewarning since we had four young kids that could not be entertained for 1 1/2 hours it took, and we did not receive our entrees in the end. This is not the first bad experience here, but definitely the worst."
Al R.,"Mountain View, CA",34,15,13,2.0,7/2/2016,"I love the Cheesecake Factory but for this particular visit I have to give it 2 stars. I'd give it one, but the cheesecake was good (mango lime). I called ahead to order a cheesecake for pick-up to bring home after work. It took me a 1/2 hour to get there and find parking so I figured I'll be able to walk in, pay for the cheesecake, and leave. I gave my name at the dessert counter, paid, then waited. A couple behind me placed an order. I was waiting 10 minutes and asked why my cheesecake wasn't ready yet, after all I called ahead. And it wasn't a meal order. Just one whole cheesecake. I was told it would be right out and that someone was preparing it. I reminded them that I called ahead, so why wasn't it ready? The cashier apologized and said it will be right out. I went to the host and asked for the manager. While I was waiting (5 more minutes) two boxes were delivered from the back and the couple who had ordered behind me left with their order. The other order was mine. When the manager arrived I complained about the wait time but she couldn't explain why my order wasn't ready when I arrived. She offered me a discount which I accepted, but seriously? It took them 45 minutes from the time I called to walk the cheesecake from the back to the front. Were they making it??"
Juanita H.,"King City, CA",20,8,5,2.0,9/13/2016,"Not good service today, waitress didn't know how to use the ""cake pay"" app. Said numerous times she would ask her manager, this was when we first sat down, I asked her repeatedly about the app. Even when we gave her our card to pay she still didn't have an answer for us. The food wasn't very good either, coffee was old and bitter, she did serve fresher coffee. The Cesar salad tasted like fish. The bread was cold, so no use for the butter. The turkey wasn't on the sandwich it was laying half off the sandwich. Not a good experience and at barely 4pm the dinner rush hadn't even started. Will be taking a break from this restaurant for a few months. Didn't even bother with the cheesecake today."
Steve B.,"Newark, CA",7,29,1,1.0,4/12/2016,"My family of 4 went here on a Sunday afternoon so it was not busy at all. We got a table right away and then that's when it all went downhill. We waited 20 minutes just to have our server come to our table. During this time servers from other areas would pass us, but did not help or ask if we wanted a drink while we waited. Finally after the server came to our table he had the audacity to ask what drinks we wanted. Screw drinks we were ready to order after just seating there for that long. He took our order and said he would be back with our drinks and bread soon, as the kids were very hungry and thirsty.  Another 15 min later and NO drinks or even free BREAD, yet the table across from us had their bread and drinks served right away. Finally my wife and kids had enough of the horrible or should I say NO service at all and left.  I would be understanding of this situation during a busy night, but the place was empty on a weekend afternoon. I don't think I will be going back to this location ever again."
Nicholas T.,"Schaumburg, IL",136,2,,5.0,6/30/2016,"To my boy Kayla,  You the realest waitress with the chilliest boyfriend. Tolerated our questions unrelated to meal and was not annoyed and contributed to the act. Our first time here. 10/10 would come again only for her. Also her first day. 9:25pm written baybuhy. Great service! From, The 3 person table"
Hailey H.,"Redwood City, CA",20,13,5,2.0,8/4/2016,Ordered door dash... the food I got was over seasoned and over cooked! almost like if I handed a recipe to a middle Schooler and they made the food! the one in San Mateo at least takes pride in what they make.....the asparagus looks old and my chicken was burnt I'm 100% not happy......I gave it two stars because they managed to make my favorite dish from Cheesecake Factory something I may never eat again.... So good for you Palo Alto!
Ski M.,"Palo Alto, CA",0,10,3,1.0,4/11/2016,"Ok So my cousin comes from out of town to treat me for my Birthday! (Yayyyyyy) NOT! Our waitress was really nice, unfortunately nothing else here was, now I have been coming to this location for the last 11 years which I have to say every year it's worse :/  Anywho Miss nice Waitress gets us drinks and bread, we ordered our food and proceed to drinks! Back to bread...... Can't get enough of the brown bread!!  But under the bread was T R A S H.......  Flagged down waitress and B O U N C E D! I was sick to my stomach!! Couldn't stand going back here so many times I promised myself I would never go back but this time I PROMISE I WONT EVERRRR!"
Priscilla F.,"Fremont, CA",129,53,9,1.0,6/5/2015,"DO NOT COME HERE IN LARGE GROUPS!  Heck, don't come here at all.    You will experience the following: 1. Being avoided like you are the Black Plague.  2. Waiting forever for someone to take your order for drinks and food.  3. Waiting even longer for your food to come out.  4. Your party's food will come out at different times OR  5. Some of your party's food will not come out at all.  *Good luck asking for any drink refills or for bags and boxes to pack up your food too.  A very important tip, Cheesecake Factory: When you have a party that consists of 20 or more people, there needs to be more than ONE waiter taking drink and food orders. We had almost 30 people in our party and only ONE PERSON took our orders. Smh The only time there was a lot of waiters around is when they came to hand out plates. However, even then it didn't really matter because not everyone's food even made it out of the kitchen. 2 people in our party NEVER EVEN GOT THEIR FOOD.  Seriously?! How can you not even bring someone's food out at all and don't even come back to apologize or bring something else to compensate for the missing dish? But instead, you just let them be hungry and watch everyone else eat their food.  I haven't been at this particular Cheesecake Factory in quite some time and it's sad and frustrating to see that the service has gone completely down the drain.  I can honestly without a doubt say that I nor any of my family will not be retuning anytime soon, because of the simple reason being: YOU GUYS SUCK!!!!!!!"
Jackie M.,"San Leandro, CA",54,84,138,1.0,6/6/2015,"This is my go to location for so many reasons! University Ave. is always such nice scenery & beautiful people walking around. This location is beautifully decorated & the wait is never long. I have always had great service until last night & I don't know if I will ever feel comfortable coming back!!  Came in for dinner to celebrate an anniversary & was seated right away! Our waiter came over and took our drink order. Few mins later he returned with our drinks & bread. He seemed nervous, or just didn't want to be there. Wasn't very friendly! Took our food order, brought out our food and than service went downhill! He went MIA for a good 20 mins! We kept having to stop other waiters for our refills and napkins needs. He finally appeared out of thin air & brought us our bill. By this point I was annoyed and it was time to go. Gave him my atm card, he came back a couple of mins later and gave me the black book with my receipt to sign. Said thank you & went on his way quick. After a few mins I noticed my atm card was nowhere to be found! I emptied my whole purse out & it was not with me. Our waiter was gone, couldn't find him anywhere. I stopped another waitress & she went on the hunt for him. She came out & told us she let him know. We waited & waited & no waiter. I stopped the same waitress & she ran back to check again. She was gone for a few mins than randomly showed up with my card that had been found by a hostess on the ground on the other side of the restaurant. Not acceptable! Our waiter never came out!!!  Moral of the story, watch your credit cards!! I feel like he was trying to get over on me! Thank god I noticed my card was missing!!"
