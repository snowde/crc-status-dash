Karen W.,"Oakland, CA",362,675,3385,3.0,5/2/2016,"The food was A-OK for The Cheesecake Factory.  They have such a big menu, you will surely get something good to eat.  Service was attentive.  We ordered the chopped salad, garlic noodles with shrimp, grilled fish tacos, and almond crusted salmon salad.  My salmon salad was the last to come out and the server said they had to cook it longer; however, by the time it came, it was crispy critters, shriveled and dry, a small piece on top of a big salad.  We topped it off with key lime cheesecake, red velvet cheesecake and strawberry shortcake"
Ellie W.,"San Francisco, CA",297,45,51,5.0,9/8/2016,"Lunch here is great as always, I'm one of those people that always just orders the same thing...at least when I'm here and that's for the Louisiana chicken pasta. But hands down, I really came here for that HONEY WHEAT BREAD yassss! I can't turn down carbs when I am here so if you're not sure what to get for lunch - go with the pasta dish I got - you can never go wrong with that! Lots of spices and flavor in the pasta with some fried chicken on top YUMMMM Also go during lunch time when it's half the price and their portions are huuuuugggeee already - very worth it!"
Sapana B.,"Milpitas, CA",0,6,,2.0,8/21/2017,Very slow service. Below average food. Chicken picata had no test... skinilicious veg salad was bland.  In short wasn't happy with the food b service.
Morgan T.,"Palo Alto, CA",267,55,170,5.0,5/23/2017,"By far the best Happy Hour in the area. Sit in the bar, watch some of the games and enjoy the corn cake tamales.. they are to die for!"
Andrea S.,"San Jose, CA",0,15,6,1.0,5/28/2017,"I ordered avocado toast and got guacamole toast instead.  Spoke to the manager, Sarah, and she flat out lied saying that the recipe calls for guacamole on it.  Checked the menu... says ""grilled artisan bread topped with FRESH AVOCADO, marinated tomato, watercress, radish, and red onion. Drizzled with EVOO and lemon.""  Didn't see anything about guacamole.  The manager said three other people had the same complaint and that they've submitted a request to corporate.  Doesn't make sense though because all the other Cheesecake Factories haven't had this problem.   It also would've been nice to not have such a poor attitude towards my friend and I when we inquired about it."
Evelyn Y.,"Modesto, CA",5,7,,1.0,6/9/2017,The food sucked my salad was brown the soup was over salty and peppered we picked for items in the menu they were all bad will not come back
Louisa T.,"Ione, CA",0,14,1,2.0,8/5/2017,"Service was fine, food was horrible. Had to send it back and was so bad I didn't want a replacement. Quality of everything we ordered was garbage."
Samantha O.,"San Jose, CA",10,82,30,2.0,5/14/2017,"Our server was really nice, but not so much attentive. We had a hard down flagging him down the times we needed anything. But when we did get his attention he was more than willing to help us. We did have to clear off the table ourselves to make room for our main dishes though. But honestly... I've never been so disappointed in the quality of taste at a restaurant and THE CHEESECAKE FACTORY at that. I mean they don't have thee best food but I've never been disappointed with anything I've ever ordered at other locations and the food was always good for the most part.  First, the food took pretty long. I ordered the farefalle chicken and roasted garlic pasta and I kid you not didn't taste anything BUT over cooked garlic. The taste was so overpowering and disgusting. What's crazy is I normally love garlic. I couldn't taste even taste any salt in the dish. I feel really bad and hate to be the customer that asks for a whole new dish so I'd normally just eat it and go about my day but I couldn't even do that. My boyfriends pasta didn't look too appetizing either, it looked like boiled noodles with a can of diced tomatoes poured on top and tasted like it too. My dad and grandma ordered steak which came out okay. Mom and aunt ordered fish and that was alright too... but nothing like our experiences at the Cheesecake Factory on Steven's Creek. I really hope that our experience was just a one-time thing because the place was busy for Mother's Day and I actually do like The Cheesecake Factory."
Gladys R.,"Palo Alto, CA",0,2,,1.0,4/23/2017,Such bad service; my family and I sat there for 10 minutes waiting for the server just to acknowledge us. Then a couple of young women sat next to us and within 2 minutes they were being serviced -_-  Then when my combination of shrimp and steak arrived the mash potatoes and the steak were cold. I was so hungry so I hate everything but I am definitely not returning
Melinda G.,"Los Altos, CA",0,18,,2.0,8/1/2017,"We decided to splurge tonight on Cheesecake Factory, two months stuck in the children's hospital we are all sick of hospital food!! My dad went in and ordered the food takeout. First, they were out of all pastA! Huh? How does that happen? Second they were out of crab and then they weren't. The food was lukewarm and they did not put bread in with our order, nor did they put any utensils or condiments! For the money spent, we definitely thought the food would be better and hot! The pizza place down the way is faster, hotter and cheaper. It seems like to go orders are half assed, bummer :("
Venna Q. T.,"Fremont, CA",267,256,2705,4.0,6/29/2015,"I love cheesecake and I love appetizers. I don't know why people always dislike chain restaurants. I like that I can have the exact same thing, when I want it, in different locations all over the Bay Area.  The grilled artichokes or crab wontons are a good go to for appetizers. Who can say no to their bread basket or salads?!  The fish tacos weren't anything special and of course, we didn't have any room for dessert. My favorites have to be the original strawberry and red velvet cheesecakes. So good. I really want a slice of each right now, just thinking about it!"
Mark N.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,77,2,4.0,5/23/2017,"Food was great quality, but the restaurant was busy and it took nearly half an hour for our food to come out. The bread helped, and our server was apologetic, but it became frustrating to have to wait that long."
May Y.,"East Palo Alto, CA",6,167,140,3.0,4/19/2016,"Overall:   A chain restaurant with solid food.   The cheesecakes are getting pricier and pricier. :)   This review is from multiple visits. Services:  Depending when you come here, you have a different crew.   - AM/Lunch crew:   Good services.  one of our entrees need to be re-do and the manager (a middle aged man) came over and explained.  We appreciate that a lot.  It was all proactive.   I would totally rate 4 stars for their effort.  - Takeout crew:  There was a female mgr that is not as friendly.  The crew seems to be afraid of her.   Food/drinks:    - Great bread before  - Black peppered Cajun Shrimp - Very tasty and spicy.  Would totally order this again. - Manderia Chicken - One of our favorites - Pasta Cabonara - with Shrimp.  The PA location seems to make their shrimp pretty good.  One of the pasta has GF option.  They can replace it with Brown rice pasta.  :)  - Salads - Most of their salads are solid and huge portion - Kids menu - Mac/Cheese - creamy and cheesy.   - Kids menu - Spaghetti and meatball.  OK.   One time, they told us they ran out of meatball and if we would just spaghetti with pasta sauce.   (Really???) Tips:  Sometimes their food is a bit salty.   It is your preference, but I would ask them to go light on the salt next time. Decor: Causal and lots of seating. Kids friendly:  Yes.     Gluten Free/Sensitivity:  There a number of options labeled as GF.  The only cheesecake that is officially GF is the Godiva chocolate.  It is really good!  My hubby is not a chocolate fan and he commented how smooth it is."
SF D.,"San Francisco, CA",0,17,,1.0,4/15/2017,"The worst service of any restaurant that I've had in a while. This service at this Cheesecake factory is so slow that we spent 2 hours Friday night waiting for food. We ordered 2 items: the eggplant parm and a salad.  The eggplant and the salad was good, however the the pasta had no sauce :( Our server said he would bring us the tomato sauce on the side for the pasta which I said ok to.   After 20 minutes, I asked another server to get our waiter.  Then another 20 minutes later I asked another waiter if he could help us.  He said ""what do you want me to do?""...which really really made me angry as I explained that I have a pasta with no sauce getting cold for 40 minutes and no one is helping me. I didn't expect that I would have to wait another 20 minutes for the sauce to come at which point we had both finished our meal. The waiter took my cold pasta to the back where they mixed it and brought it back out.  As you can imagine, it was half cold and half warm as they mixed it in the back. The waiters looked to be trying their best, but if the kitchen is so backed up that it takes a customer to ask 3 times and 60 minutes to get you to correct your mistake of forgetting to give me pasta sauce then you really shouldn't accept customers in your business."
YH L.,"Redwood City, CA",77,72,177,4.0,8/4/2016,It was Sunday and after lunch hour; I had begin with a Cheesecake of the month.  The cheesecake was soft and sweet; the Nutella favor was present in each bites.  the crust was crushing and not over powering the favor of the cheesecake.  The whip cream top was the perfect amount too.  Thank you for the Cheesecake National Day that I was able to enjoy this delicious at half of the price.   I am a big fan of the this place even that I do not go as often then other people however I do visit it in special occasion for me.  The customer service are polite and attentive.  I come back to them because if it.  The good service complement the food and the good environment.
Anthony C.,"San Ramon, CA",70,12,1,5.0,11/20/2016,"So I just wanted to write this because I really felt the need to after the impression left on me by the manager and I believe she deserves some major recognition  I did not eat here I am a doordash driver And I had an order here for a customer I was waiting for some time when the manager (Jenna) happened to see me I told her I had been waiting for a little while and she  jumped right to helping me.. All I can say is that from this point til when I asked her her name she went above and beyond  her customer service is exceptional she was fast moved quickly was very kinda and caring and made sure everything in the order was taken care of properly  Now I have worked in or alongside the food industry for some time now And have been around many many good establishments and management  And I have to say that Jenna is truly up there with the best management I have seen, herself taking part in whatever needs to be done no matter how menial it seems or basic of a position what a great example of an employee"
PJ G.,"Los Altos, CA",0,3,,1.0,7/29/2017,This is the worst place you would ever visit. They will make you wait for 25 mins and seat someone behind you by saying they are their friends. Try to complain and the manager does lip service when she is colluding with her staff.  Went for the sub par food just because they were open late night Saturday but you are better off being hungry.
Iris T.,"Palo Alto, CA",0,1,,1.0,3/5/2017,"I went to The Cheesecake Factory already a couple of times and I am super excited about their cheesecake. However, yesterday I had THE WORST experience ever with The Cheesecake Factory. We were with a group of people and wanted to order some cheesecake for dessert. We ordered 5 pieces of original cheesecake with hot fudge sauce via Doordash and waited for the cheesecake to be delivered. After the delivery, we found out that 2 of the 5 cheesecake pieces had come in DEEPFROZEN and we were unable to eat them. Also, there were only 3 VERY SMALL cups of hot fudge sauce delivered, which were not even enough for half of us...  So I called The Cheesecake Factory to ask them for an explanation and to fix the problem. In the first place they blamed the Doordasher and told me to call Doordash, which frustrated me even more. When I insisted that The Cheesecake Factory had to fix the problem theirselves, the woman on the other side of the line eventually agreed to call Doordash and let the Doordasher come back to bring new cheesecake.  The Doordasher eventually came back with new cheesecake and hot fudge sauce, but he didn't even get paid for this extra delivery... This is horrible and I don't think I will ever go to The Cheesecake Factory again, since I don't want to encourage their inappropriate behaviour in this situation."
Ben L.,"Burlingame, CA",22,232,210,2.0,3/18/2016,"Came in for lunch and it wasn't busy. It took 10-15 mins before the server came though. We ordered and it took 25 mins for our food to come. Seemed long for not being busy. I asked for wheat toast and no mayo on my club sandwich. It came with mayo on wheat. I didn't want to return it, and I didn't tell her until I was almost done eating it (I'm too nice lol). The server was really nice and apologized for the cooks got it wrong. The green salad was good but could have used some tomatoes or cucumbers."
Samuel M.,"East Palo Alto, CA",1,15,1,4.0,6/14/2017,"I'm writing this review specifically for Taylor, one of the servers at this location. During my lunch about two weeks ago, my own server practically ignored me. So I had to flag down another server, who happened to be the one I'm writing about. Taylor was fantastic. Even though she had her own tables to worry about she cheerfully came over to my table multiple times to check up on my order. This server--I kid you not--is beautiful inside and out. If management is reading this review please give Taylor a promotion."
