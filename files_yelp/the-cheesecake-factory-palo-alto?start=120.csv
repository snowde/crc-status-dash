Ashley Y.,"Modesto, CA",17,8,1,2.0,6/9/2017,"The Cobb salad looked dirty, the clam chowder was too over-spiced, the chicken strips were more bread than chicken, and the chicken Riesling was boring. Honestly, I've had much better food for much less. Didn't even bother to try the cheesecake, I was so disappointed. The only saving grace: our server was en pointe. Very nice, attentive, and gave helpful suggestions.  The interior is also beautiful. Otherwise, didn't like this place at all. I won't be returning."
Francis D.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,33,,3.0,6/27/2017,"I've had better experiences at other Cheesecake Factories. The service here is lacking and the waitresses here are unpleasant and impatient. The person who gave us our bread practically threw it on our table. The good thing is that the food is relatively good and priced reasonably. I ordered one of their ""glam burgers"" which was tasty. I don't think I'll come back solely because of the staff here. Not a very friendly atmosphere..."
Tandis N.,"San Jose, CA",31,49,16,1.0,2/26/2017,"I am a fair reviewer and I've worked in the restaurant industry for seven years as a server and a manager. I was extremely disappointed in both the quality of food and the attitude of the waitstaff tonight. We were seated in A timely fashion, but that was the only part of our experience that was decent. We were led to a small booth right next to the bathroom and a service station. Before seating ourselves we asked if there was another table available and the guy who was seating is (not a host, some staff member in all white) rudely responded ""no. That's all we have. You can wait for another table."" So, we sat down anyways. We were 4 tall adults and the booth barely fit us. About three minutes later, I noticed a party of two was seated in a bigger booth near ours. After some time, the server came with waters and bread and told us she'd be back shortly. Five minutes later she returned and we were ready to order. The server was nice and took our drink and food orders.  We didn't have any napkins so we asked her for some. I ordered the hibachi steak medium and my mother ordered the steak Diane medium. The other two people ordered a salmon dish and a shrimp dish. When the food arrived I noticed immediately that both steaks were clearly overcooked. There was no pink at all, definitely NOT medium. We were hungry, so we are. After five minutes the server came to ask how the food was. I told her that the steaks were cooked well done and not to our liking, and the salmon was dry as well. She didn't ask if we wanted the dishes re-done, if we would rather have anything else, I don't think she even apologized. She just nodded and so my father again asked for napkins (which she had never brought) and she used that opportunity to leave. She brought the napkins and that was the last we saw of her until the check. Never asked if we wanted anything else or another round of drinks. Another server eventually caught my eye and came over to ask if I needed anything. I asked for a box and the check, which he brought. The original server only returned then to run our check, forgetting to bring back the credit card. We asked another server for it and left after paying. I really live Cheesecake Factory but probably won't return to this one since the staff seems to be mediocre at best. If a customer complains about something, it is the servers responsibility to make it right. Had she offered anything to alleviate the circumstance, even offering a free dessert, it would have shown concern. We were at table 31 around 10:15pm."
Lauren R.,"Mountain View, CA",83,4,,2.0,6/18/2017,"Came here on Father's Day, we made a reservation and they told us we had a spot but when we came in they told us they didn't take reservations and we would have to wait. It was only 30 minutes so we waited, but it was 102 outside and they had no air conditioning, when we went to order he never came back to fill our drinks, and most of the food was out. Horrible experience"
Lee K.,"San Francisco, CA",470,377,330,2.0,3/19/2016,"INCONSISTENCY is the only consistent thing about this place. Like so many chain restaurants, the Cheesecake Factory has a hard time with consistency in quality and availability.  We've had some REALLY GOOD dishes here... only to return and be disappointed with REALLY BAD versions of the same dishes.  Often items on the menu are not even available. I went for brunch and 3 of us decided to order the crab benedict.  Our server returned 5 min later to tell us it was not ready.  We were surprised by that and she offered to double check.  10 min later she returned and confirmed that we were out of luck.  So we ordered other dishes that varied from good to bad.  Among the bad (really bad) was a veggie benedict I ordered.  It was served on two overcooked and super greasy fried cakes of grains.  Served on top of that were tiny, cubed, grilled, overly greasy vegetables.  On top of that were two overcooked eggs (ala hard boiled consistency).  On top of that was an overly salty hollandaise sauce.  And next to this mess of a dish was an abundant side of super greasy hash browns. The experience left me feely regretful, disgusted, and unhealthy for the day. Oh, by they way, Cheesecake Factory when are you going to stop using transfats in your cheesecake?"
Andrea R.,"Menlo Park, CA",5,1,,1.0,2/22/2017,"I just spend 30 minutes trying to buy a slice of cheesecake, there was like 6 people waiting for food orders  and  even when the orders were not ready or there they wouldn't even look to the people that were waiting, the girl who serves the slices just was walking around with empty dishes, finally when she was about  help me she got distracted by an employee and I couldn't wait more because my ride was already there.  I already had some not so good experiences here  but  today was ridiculous, I would rather go to the hillsdale location even if is far, but the staff there is more helpful"
Jeannie C.,"Sunnyvale, CA",0,3,,1.0,2/22/2017,"Today, I ordered Salmon lunch special and pasta for my daughter. The salmon dish came with an OLD DRESSING ( disgusting )  AND COLD MASHED POTATOES IN A COLD PLATE.  The pasta was even DRY AND HARD ( the top pieces' colors were even different from the ones on the bottom) .  I asked the waiter to fix it and it was brought back to me.  But, I lost appetite already and couldn't finish.  The waiter was kind so I left him tip but will never go back again. Gross !!!"
Rebecca H.,"Sonoma, CA",1,9,,1.0,2/25/2017,"First one star review on Yelp ever.  Came in today before the Stanford basketball game. Ordered lunch for four.  Mine was an omelet.  Waiting. Waiting. Waiting.  Two baskets of bread later.  Three drink refills. No food.  Manger finally informed me all the food was ready but the only was made is a non stick pan and being remade. Asked for the rest (we were going to be late) and told 5-10 max for the omelet (?? I can make one in like 3 min at home).  Everyone ate their food, still no omelet.  Asked for check. Wait wait wait. I left with no food and we have now missed  1/2 the game we drove an hour and a half to see.   The one thing chain restaurants should do well is get reasonable food out fast. BIG miss, no sense of urgency (they knew we were in a rush) and no apology. Can I get a refund on or game tickets ???"
Rachelle S.,"Cupertino, CA",23,6,2,5.0,10/24/2016,"I LOVE Cheesecake factory. I order the Renee's special and of course the amazing Cheesecake Factory ranch!!  The prices are reasonable, the service is good and the new app is very helpful if you are splitting a bill or sharing with a friend...or in a hurry!"
Christopher D.,"Palo Alto, CA",0,49,,1.0,9/16/2017,"Industrialized food, industrialized service.  Like a slightly eating at a slightly upgraded mall foodcourt.  Cheesecake is very good, however.  Order one to go."
Haley A.,"Pleasanton, CA",1,34,,1.0,6/16/2016,"Twice I told myself I will never return to this place, and there will never be a third. The first time my boyfriend and I came here it took over an hour to get our food. They kept sending different people over every time to apologize to us and it just started getting odd. Then after we finally got our food and ate, we were in better spirits so we decided to get dessert. We couldn't find our server or any of the people who kept apologizing before to help us. Eventually we just wanted to leave.  The second time I went here the same thing happened. We waited almost 40 min for one of the four cocktails we ordered because they claimed someone bumped into the person with the drinks. Fair enough, I've worked in the restaurant biz before and understand this happens... but then it took half way into our meal to get it. How much time does it take to make one drink again? Then the same person who had to wait for their drink that spilled also had to wait for their plate to come! They gave all of us our plates and he had to wait. We all sat and chose to wait to eat ours but eventually it took so long, and he was feeling awkward already for making us wait, so we started eating. Finally, he gets his fish tacos and as he's eating he realizes one of them is chicken! As a pescatarian, this would have made me physically ill if this was mine. Disgusting.  Never again. Never. Ever."
Ray Y.,"Pacifica, CA",36,33,150,1.0,8/27/2017,We got here on Sunday and were told 20 min wait actually took close to an hour partially my fault I should have taken a table in the bar we finally got seated and our waiter said that he just got back from his break and needed a few minutes to settle in I'm thinking what was his break for another 15 minutes go by and he finally comes over to take our order before giving us any water or cleaning the sticky residue left by the previous customer that we pointed out upon being seated another 10 minutes go by and we get some water and bread then we waited another 30 minutes and the table next to us that was seated after us received their food our waiter walks by and asks if we're ready to order did he think he was being funny that was the last straw we walked do you know how many places there are to eat on university avenue that actually give good friendly fast service without the sarcasm and nonchalant service
Jocelyn P.,"San Jose, CA",4,27,2,1.0,12/27/2016,"I came inside with my best friend to eat because I got a $50 gift card and at first everything was going great until they told us that they ran out of bed and minutes later people who came in after us got their breads appetizer and meals right away their a party of 8 and both me and my friend are a party of 2! No breads and one of our appetizer barley came in, very dissapointed"
F.H. H.,"Santa Clara, CA",1,18,,1.0,2/9/2017,"Update on 2/10/17: So the manager added their comment asking me to go to their contact web page, which requires me to add in lots of required personal information, and then I suppose I have to recount the whole experience in the Comments section, again. This feels like a lot of work, there is a way for business to send message to members to avoid yet another step of web form. And why can't a restaurant phone number and contact name be provided for customers to call back? Or is this to make customers just give up, and stop complaining as well as going to this business??? ---------------------------- The latest review about needing a rain poncho - I think one also need skates to walk in their bar area. For about couple years now the stone flooring in the bar area is always slippery, obviously due to food/drinks spilled on the floor, and lack of proper cleaning. It was to the point you can easily slipped if you're wearing leather sole shoes or heels. Many of my friends joked about ice skating.  Surely the management understand the liability risk here? About bartenders?  It's a hit or miss. I have observed one bartender who does seem to be making a lot of noise behind counter, not sure if it's the same one from the other review. That does take away the supposed calm and enjoyable ambiance a bit. And for sure not the high end restaurants their competitors are on same street. The standard food is ok, perhaps people wanting the standard Cheesecake Factory food or dessert should check out other locations."
Yelper ..,"California City, CA",0,42,,1.0,5/13/2017,"The absolute worst restaurant in downtown Palo Alto.  Came here for lunch and waited for 15 minutes for our slow waitress to come by and take a drink order. The table next to us was also upset about the wait, they flagged down a hostess and asked her to get their waitress. Waitress finally takes our order.  We wait another 40 minutes for the food. Waitress finally comes by and says she'll go check on the food. Then someone else comes out to tell us there is something wrong with the food and it hasn't been made yet. I'M NOT SURE WHY IT TAKES 40 FUCKING MINUTES TO TELL A CUSTOMER THAT THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH THERE FOOD AND IT HASN'T BEEN MADE IT. SO RIDICULOUS.  I was telling my friend about this and she said she also had a bad experience. She found an actual hair in her food and a waitress dropped a glass of water on their table.  The food is also horrible I hear.  There are so many better restaurants in area to eat at.  I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE AT ALL."
Emilia G.,"San Francisco, CA",0,82,,5.0,4/22/2017,"It's too bad about all the recent bad to mediocre reviews.  I just want to say that tonight I had the best high quality dinner ever at a Cheescake Factory restaurant.  I was surprised, as it is a chain restaurant and though I liked the food I just usually found it average.    The service was efficient and terrific.  We had three servers, two were covering for Greg? Gary? When he got back he took care of us like royalty the rest of the night.  I am sorry I don't remember his exact name.  I must say all the servers were cordial and thankful and corteous. They were all great! The restaurant was full yet the wait was short.  Our appetizer was brought out quickly and piping hot!  My MaiTai was the best I've had in a looooooog time!  We ordered the 4cheese pasta with chicken and it was pretty good.  We also ordered the fried shrimp platter.  I highly recommend it. When you order it you will know why.  I will say no more! We also had a huge mug of their excellent coffee to accompany the oreo cheesecake and the lemon meringue cheesecake, both delicous!  We will be back."
Tuan P.,"Mountain View, CA",10,226,47,3.0,11/30/2015,"Antioxidant salad  - yummy. Not ridiculous big. Ahi tartare - it was good but regular Corn soup - good, bowl is gigantic, feeds family of 4 easy Mexican lettuce wrap - hot plate wilted the lettuce - grilled chicken was too big and dry - try Asian next time Portobello, avocado, zucchini fries - best in show Mac N cheese - 1 kid portion can be split between a 4 & 6 yo"
Irene L.,"Mountain View, CA",0,7,,1.0,9/2/2017,"Save your money. Service was slow. Food was meh. I ordered beef medallions on a bed of mashed potatoes, flanked on either side with asparagus and grape tomatoes. The beef should have been medium rare; it was medium well. The asparagus was tough.  I think they served the bottoms that I would have thrown out. The potatoes were lukewarm, and the tomatoes were cold. Never again."
James Q.,"Sacramento, CA",113,14,3,5.0,4/3/2017,"It's a really mellow location to eat out with friends. The food is also quite good, but average if you consider the price. We also had a little hiccup with our food but the manager Amy resolved the issue very quickly and efficiently. Overall, I had a great dinner with my friends and we had a very pleasant time."
Jacob J.,"San Jose, CA",61,259,29,1.0,11/14/2016,"If my food is ready for pick up and you don't want to go pick it up and make me wait 15 minutes because you need to do menial work, then wow. I've worked customer service. Just go get my food and continue your job if you aren't busy at all."
