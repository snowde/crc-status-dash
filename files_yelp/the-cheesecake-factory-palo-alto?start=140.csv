Michelle W.,"West San Jose, San Jose, CA",1,6,,4.0,8/20/2017,They serve the best salmon portion. The mash and asparagus is amazing as well. Love their mango key lime cheesecake
Amit K.,"Mountain View, CA",1,16,,3.0,7/11/2017,"Food's not as good as it used to be though the decor, service and staff are good. Lost my taste for cheesecake I guess....."
Philip V.,"Anaheim, CA",0,9,1,1.0,5/10/2016,"I just had a very unpleasant experience here and wanted to write a complaint.  I came here for lunch and ordered a lunch special pasta but was given a dinner pasta instead ( a more expensive item).  When I asked the waitress about the check, her tone was overall accusatory and that it was the customer's responsibility to clarify the order. I complained to the manager afterwards who offered to charge me the lower price (in which I declined).  This is because I was upset not about the $3 difference, but the experience with the waitress that, despite excellent food at the Cheesecake Factory, left a bad taste in my mouth."
Alex S.,"San Jose, CA",1,15,,2.0,3/30/2017,"...and then the reactive manager replies to me to tell me that I should inform the manager. HAHAHAHA.... why don't I just apply for the job and Manage the place myself; I'm so proactive, I would totally do a better job!!! No, why don't I just not go back?!?!?"
Niki M.,"Cupertino, CA",11,19,1,1.0,12/23/2016,"Really disappointed. To start, the dish I ordered came in an extremely small portion compared to the same exact dish that I'd ordered at a different cheesecake factory location. Secondly, we didn't have time for dessert so we ordered it to go, and once we were able to eat the cake we noticed the center was missing a chunk of cake (looking exactly as if someone had taken 2 bites and left the food). I thought perhaps some cake fell off, but it was oddly in the center of the slice and very clean--like a fork had deliberately removed a couple bites from the cake. Flavors were good, but overall experience really ruined it for me."
Megan H.,"Huntington Beach, CA",42,25,1,2.0,2/24/2017,"This review is for the service.  Omg could they please at least try to be good at their jobs.  This is the second time that we've waited over an hour to have our order taken.  And want your drink refilled? Good luck! And where's the bread refill since we wait forever for food? If you value your time at all, go to a different restaurant"
Anita L.,"Union City, CA",347,627,385,3.0,1/25/2016,"Basic place to come to for some food and drinks. Never really had a bad experience, but it's a chain store restaurant so it's not like it stands out to me as anything special.  I've never had to wait for a table no matter what time I come, so I will give it props for that. And I can hang out here for hours just chatting and not have them give me signs that they want to kick me out."
Adriana L.,"Palo Alto, CA",269,23,,4.0,4/4/2017,I love the vegetarian burger plus they always have great service. Oh yea and the bread with butter
Kimanne B.,"San Jose, CA",61,127,712,3.0,1/2/2016,"Came here close to 9 pm on a Saturday night. The wait was about 10 minutes. Order: chicken lettuce tacos with Asian style. Surprisingly, it was delicious and filling. The only downside was no napkins even when they brought out our food. I would recommend this place if you are in the area but there is so many other food spot to go in Palo Alto. Cheesecake Factory definitely has a lot of competition right in that area."
Jay O.,"East Palo Alto, CA",5,8,,1.0,12/26/2016,"Ate here a few months ago I'm from Florida and cheesecake is a big deal there but this one in the ohhh so expensive Palo Alto surrounded by restaurants sucks. I've had some damn good food from Cheesecake Factory but not from this one, hire better cooks"
Ofra M.,"Santa Clara, CA",0,3,,1.0,8/17/2017,"Possible the worst service ever that I encountered in a place advertising as a family restaurant. It took very long to find us a place and to set up the table though the place was not full and then to come and take our orders. We then waited more than an hour for our food after we asked about it several times. Dishes, such as the hamburger or steak were dry and not fresh as if they waited long to be served and then perhaps warmed in some way. And on top of it the manager arrived to check with us what was wrong, heard all about it and just went away without even apologising, or trying to explain or perhaps returning later o suggest something as a compensation. I would give it a minus star if there were something like that."
Maryam W.,"Berkeley, CA",90,60,6,3.0,11/21/2016,"The best thing about the Cheesecake Factory is it's open a bit late and has gluten-free items. Every Cheesecake Factory is about the same coast to coast so it's a reliable meal. Salads are good here, but they keep the place so freaking cold year 'round I'm never really comfortable here. However, it's a good place to meet friends because they literally have something for everybody and the servers are the nicest. Oh, and cheesecake. ;-)"
Maureen P.,"Palo Alto, CA",4,45,,1.0,8/1/2017,"Ordered a Cobb salad for delivery and received some other salad, so had it resilience red; salad was made incorrectly and wasn't a Cobb salad. Ordered a Cobb again during the week thinking that the kitchen would have its act together better but nope, wasn't a Cobb. It's really not that hard, Cheesecake Factory. But if you're going to charge $15.00 for a salad, please get it right."
Roberto V.,"Palo Alto, CA",1,9,,1.0,12/22/2016,"Where do I begin Lets me see now 1. the untensils were dirty 2. the water I didn't ask for had little black thing's floating in it 3. it took forever for my wife to get her order(soup & salad) I actually finished my whole meal before my wife got her food.The manager came over but to the wrong table, I told her the problem's and she just said ok I'll look into it and thats the last I heard or saw of her(she was pregnant) In the past I have been to this palo alto spot but this was the first bad experience. non the less I won't be going back anytime soon. Lastly I e-mailed The Corporate to take issue with the horrible service but I guess customer retention was not important enough for them to respond. I only with there was a half a star. The waitress was very nice but the manager now thats another story."
Sandhya G.,"Santa Clara, CA",61,132,58,1.0,3/29/2016,"Terrible service !  We walked in here, with a reservation, on a Friday night and still waited 45 minutes to get our table. The wait was understandable but the service? It's the worse I've ever experienced.  We had to ask for water and silverware constantly and it's not like our server was busy. He was loitering around us but conveniently forgot what we asked for, every time.  Our orders took forever to get to us and oh, the best part was when we ordered a chicken sandwich and it arrived along with bacon esp when we made sure of the ingredients.  Never going back."
Nadia S.,"Danville, CA",0,3,,2.0,8/2/2017,The service in this particular restaurant was really bad. We had to wait an hour before we got our food. We almost missed our flight due to their slow service. The food was also not that great. It was not warm enough. I have to say I've been to better ones in other parts of California. It's a really big restaurant but maybe they need to figure out how to manage a big restaurant.
Gina D.,"Palo Alto, CA",7,3,,1.0,12/10/2016,"Usually pretty good.... but breakfast.. well waited 40 minutes. Finally got our food .. failure. Cold omelette that had no taste.. my husbands eggs shriveled and cold. But most of all waitress cold, cold , cold .. burrrr. If I could do a zero star I would but it doesn't give me a option. Really!!!!"
rona h.,"Los Altos, CA",0,7,,2.0,3/8/2017,"We had a party of 6 for a birthday lunch. We had very slow service, food ok but none of our salads had any dressing. Had to request dressing and it took forever to get.  Ordered 2 glasses of wine and had to hunt down the waitress who had forgotten..... then it took a bit of time."
Brandy G.,"Santa Clara, CA",98,2,,2.0,2/18/2017,"The food was excellent like all locations but this being my first time coming to this location, on university in Palo Alto, it was horrible. I will never come to this location again. The service was not what I'd expect from a restaurant that is always busy. Our server was really nice but she was very busy and they just kept filling her tables and not giving her any kind of help. The hostess was very rude... I would've cussed her out but I didn't want to embarrass my daughter. April is not you, you did your best."
Bhavna M.,"San Francisco, CA",3,7,,1.0,4/6/2017,"Food was good, however our server was quite possibly the worst server I've ever had. We came in at 6:30 and ordered appetizers and dinner for kids (with 1 toddler and 2 kids), and then ordered 5 adult entrees. Needed two booster seats, which were not given for about 10 minutes or so. When asking the waiter about them, his response was verbatim ""I'm a little busy right now, I'll get to it in a minute."" We waited an hour before asking for the manager and asking what happened to our food. Nothing was done, we were told food was 2 minutes out. Then appetizers and entrees all came out together (which we specifically asked that appetizers come out first ) at 7:45PM. Given the delay, we didn't even touch our appetizers. Then, asked the waiter for water for our toddler and waited over 10 minutes for water. When asked where the water was, his response was ""Yea,"" and brought it out 5 minutes later. It was my bday dinner and my husband ordered my favorite cheesecake, which the staff had to ask about 3 times to apparently confirm which cheesecake slice it was.  Gabriele B was a rude server and I would never in my life hire someone like him. I have worked in the service industry and have never spoken to any customer the way he spoke to us. We were not rude, or impatient with him and literally until the end of the dinner, we gave him the benefit of the doubt, but he not did not apologize once for his service nor did he rectify the situation or errors in anyway, other than a few app's which we didn't even eat. Not only was he apathetic, but he smirked and laughed as we left, to the point where neither my husband, nor I, nor our friends wanted to tip him. I highly recommend this specific location find a better server.  After we went to a manager three times, she (Jenna) came to the table to apologize profusely, but at that point we were packing up, paying our bill (which we had to take to the front to pay as our waiter was disinterested in serving us and was busy meandering with his friends), and we told the manager he was quite possibly the worst employee we've ever seen in any establishment. In my 35 years of life I've never not tipped a single individual, understanding how hard service industry employees work, but there's a first time for everything."
