Dan J.,"Palo Alto, CA",0,16,6,2.0,1/28/2017,Thought we could have an early meal in a relaxing atmosphere but were disappointed. There was a large contingent of overactive pre-teens having a birthday party. Their behaviour and volume was more appropriate for a pizza parlor rather than a fine dining establishment. Their loud and raucous activity made it difficult for us and other diners to carry on a conversation. There was very little or no parental supervision and it's not the kids fault they acted that way it's whoever was in charge. It seemed like the wait staff tried to calm them down by dimming the lights hoping they would speak softer but it really didn't help. Nobody from the wait staff even tried to tell them that they were too loud. Food was good and our waitress was cheerful and helpful.
Miguel F.,"Porto Alegre, Brazil",0,5,3,1.0,11/20/2016,"We got our stakes without sauce and only after questioned we got the explanation they had ran out. While we are our cold plates, I found a piece of plastic in the food..."
Tina S.,"Redwood City, CA",163,199,,4.0,2/28/2016,"If you love this restaurant chain, well this one is as good as it gets.  There were lots of people waiting when we got there. The line quickly evaporated and were seated in a few minutes.  The restaurant is large and with a lot of out door seating.  The menu as most already know is enormous with a lot of variety. I went with the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp. Loved it!"
A G.,"Union City, CA",0,4,,1.0,7/29/2017,"This is the worst Cheesecake Factory I've been to!!! There were 3 in my party - we came here for lunch around noon on Friday 7/28. The place wasn't busy so we got seated right away. However, all food attendants simply walked by and no one made eye contact with anyone at our table. So after about 20 minutes, one of us went to the counter to ask for an attendant. We ordered drinks and I ordered their Special Lemonade on the menu. The lemonade came and I asked if it was the special lemonade - the server said there's no such thing as Special Lemonade. I pointed it out on the menu and I got a smile and a comment that it simply has more ice than the regular one!! Ohhh...okay....so we ordered our food. Despite the place being almost empty, it took another half hour to get our food...with the one seated next to us who came after us being served first. So we kept our cool. I ordered the Miso Salmon which I proceeded to eat....until I bit into a shrimp tail which was sandwiched between the salmon and rice. It was NOT a shrimp...it was the SHELL of a shrimp tail!!! So we flagged the server who then took my plate. My coworker said that people are allergic to shellfish i.e. shrimps should not be combined with fish! The server said fish and shrimps are in the same category...we were flabbergasted!! I waited for the rest of my party to finish their meal then someone came to our table to ask if I would like something else to eat or maybe even dessert. At this point, I've lost my appetite and why would I eat dessert without a main meal??? So I said NO, I've lost my appetite. In addition, I don't know what they'll do with my food if I decide to order something else. I've heard horror stories about what food servers and kitchen staff do with unhappy restaurant clients and would not want to be a victim. So that  person who asked if I wanted anything else, and who did not identify herself, was even unapologetic and just left the table without saying anything like as if I even owe her an apology!! The people in this restaurant don't know what customer service and service recovery means - they need to be trained!!! Be careful of this place!! If you really like Cheesecake Factory, go to another location....NOT this one!!!"
Wendy V.,"Merced, CA",128,2,,1.0,7/28/2017,"My sister and I traveled 2-3 hours to visit my family on my fathers birthday. We wanted to do something special and treat him to dinner at his favorite place which is Cheesecake Factory. After waiting 1 hour we were seated in a booth that did not fit my family. After another hour we were finally seated. I told the waiter to please bring out a cheese cake for my fathers birthday and to add it to our bill. Twice I was told that the Cheesecake would be free since it was his birthday.We got our food and drinks. My parents pasta was extremely dry, I asked for more sauce and I let her know of the quality of the their pasta and she gave me a dirty look, not even an apology. My boyfriends and my sister boyfriends fries were extremely stale but we just didn't care to say anything. I had to TRACK down two people to remind them over and over again of my fathers birthday because we were ready to go! It was already almost 11!They come to our table like 20 mins later with a small cup of ice cream for my father who turned 56! After I told them to bring him cheese cake! At that point I was literally drained from the crap service we got. My nephew got sick and I told my family to go home while we pay the bill. Another 30 min wait! We paid over 300 dollars left a 10 dollars tip(from my mother because she is the sweetest person ever!) and got extremely bad service. Never again will be going back. Super bad service. They pick and choose who they want to respect!  If I could I would rate 0 stars."
James M.,"Brentwood, CA",0,29,8,1.0,4/30/2017,"First off, disclaimer, I worked for the Cheesecake Factory in Valley Fair for a year. It has always been one of my favorite spots so for me to give it 1 star review means they really were not up to par today. I was by myself so I sat in the bar, no wait. That might have been a sign. I ordered my usual favorite, chicken piccata with white rice instead of the usual pasta it comes with. 20 mins later food comes out, I was ok waiting, the bread was good as usual and was watching basketball game on tv. As I started to dig in I realized right away something was off. It didn't taste right. After 3 or 4 bites I realized the chicken piccata was missing a key ingredient, the capers. You cannot have chicken piccata without capers, otherwise the dish tastes like a bland chicken in cream sauce... no flavor. I was waiting for waiter to come around so I could complain, but he was so busy with 3 new tables that I started to pick at it. To make it worse they even messed up the rice, it was mushy and not good. So my whole plate sucked but I was hungry... my waiter never came back to check on me so I ate it.... how can you complain about a dish after you have eaten it all.... so I paid and left, gave my usual tip because I felt guilty somehow like it wasn't his fault the dish sucked and he was over sat. 15 mins after leaving when my stomach started to ache I realized I would never be back to this location .... what is the point of having a chain restaurant if each location cannot make the dishes the same."
Julissa J.,"Newark, CA",6,3,12,1.0,9/9/2016,"If I could give this particular restaurant 0 stars I would in a heartbeat but unfortunately we are obligated to give at least one star. I've gone to The Cheesecake Factory restaurants in Pleasanton, San Francisco, and San Jose and have yet to even experience this from ANY restaurant. I have gone to this Cheesecake Factory establishment before with my parents and the service had been very slow for there being no one there.  My friend called in a week before the date on 8/30 to reserve a table for 15 people, the person on the phone said no problem we will see you on 9/6. We call on 9/6 thirty minutes before the reservation to see if it was a possibility to move it to a later time. We explain to the receptionist what the situation is and her response was ""that's funny because we don't take reservations"". A very unprofessional answer to a customer and that should've been a hint. We get the restaurant and wait for the rest of our party. As we wait the receptionist pulls out a brush and brushes her hair!!!!! Not a joke. It blew our minds.  Finally after getting seated our orders are taken and all is going well. One hour after our orders were taken both appetizers and meals come out, yes, at the same time. We finished our meals and asked for boxes, take home desserts, and the check. We received one single bill when in the beginning we asked the waiter to split the check in whichever way is easier for her (some of us were waiters and understand the pain of split checks). After collecting money and cards we hand the bill to our waiter to get out of there as fast as we could. The waiter comes back to tell us that she cant take our money and cards because she can't split the check that way. We had given her the EXACT amount in cash, and 6 credit cards. We even wrote on the back the specific amount each card would be charged. We ask for the manager politely because at this point we are tired and had been there for 3 hours. 20 mintues later we explain the situation to the manager and she tells us she can't do it. She gave us a hard time and that took another 20 minutes to figure it out.  This is by far the worst service Id ever received. Not even an apology for the situation was issued. Definitely not going back to this specific Cheesecake Factory. Save your self the agony."
Jo C.,"Santa Clara, CA",10,125,169,4.0,6/26/2016,"While waiting for our food at Sliderbar, we went here to get some shots. My party sat at the bar and our bartender was nice. After several drinks, I wish the lights weren't as dim."
Kara F.,"Palo Alto, CA",1,3,,1.0,9/11/2016,"So...we live near here and eat here sometimes. My son really wanted to eat here but hubs was not sure. I figured at 5:30 on opening football Sunday it wouldn't be busy and it wasn't, so I sort of bullied hubs into going. Our waitress was super prompt and it was all downhill from there. Drinks: two waters and an iced tea. Except virtually no ice. Before I can say ""hey!"" Waitress is gone, not to reappear for 20 minutes. She gives us our appetizer and refills my iced tea. Then disappears.  For an hour.  She comes back w my son's food and says ""Sorry, the kitchen is really slow"" but...by this time people seated after us have ordered, eaten and left. Kiddo's food is disgusting. Potatoes look like they are made of plastic and its that ""cold food on a hot plate"" thing that lets you know it sat under the warming lights getting fake baked.  But then my dinner came (10 min after my kid is served). Disgusting. Lemon herb chicken w the very saddest presentation you can imagine. Watercress reduced to two sad, wilted sprigs. Random chicken pieces, and weird oil all over everything.  Hubs gets manager. She takes my plate. And 1/2 an hour later I get served my dinner. Hubs dinner was cold and his salad a hot wilted mess but they can only fix one thing. We ask twice to replace my son's mashed potatoes.  Manager offers comp cheesecake (which we were not planning on ordering but have you met a 15 year old boy who turns down free cheesecake?). Bill comes?  Charged for cheesecake.  Can't WAIT to leave. Won't be back. Hubs stood outside telling people about our bad experience."
Malin S.,"Menlo Park, CA",0,10,,2.0,7/17/2016,Ordered a Carbonara pasta which was the worst one that I had in my life! It didn't taste ANYTHING at all... I think it could be a reason since they have a menu thick as a phone catalog... Tried a Triple Godiva choco cheesecake which was the best cheesecake I had in my life - and I don't like cheesecake!
Jeanne P.,"Mountain View, CA",63,124,529,3.0,9/13/2015,"Let me start off by saying that the dining area is super dim; you would notice this if you arrive at night. I feel I could damage my eyes just by reading the menu. The bathrooms were clean and sanitary though.  When I came for dinner with my boyfriend, I ordered the calamari and shrimp scampi. The calamari was ~$12 and the shrimp scampi was ~$20. I have to emphasize that the calamari was DELICIOUS. My boyfriend - who's very picky with calamari - loved it. The squid was tender to the point that you wouldn't need teeth to bite it. You can also tell that it was hand breaded. It also came with cocktail and garlic sauce! The garlic sauce was perfect! I just had to scrape every last bit of it off the bowl. The shrimp scampi on the other hand was meh. For a dish worth ~$20, I expected the pasta to be at least fresh. Not the kinds I can simply buy off grocery markets. Another con is the ends of the angel hair pasta. They were stuck together! The shrimp were good but a little over battered. The sauce was also overpowering with garlic. When I inspected them closely, there were 4 full cloves... I think dicing them up would be better? Anyway, I would definitely come here again for the calamari but wouldn't for the pasta. I'm curious to try their stuffed mushrooms and cheesecake too."
John R.,"Menlo Park, CA",0,101,,3.0,7/14/2017,"Sorry for losing my temper during Happy Hour, but the made-to-order avocado was too spicy and had cilantro in it, exactly what I didn't want. I blew up because last week, the shrimp bistro pasta was very spicy when I instructed the waiter I did not want it spicy. That was sent back, too. Something appears to be wrong in the kitchen and they had best get it fixed. I called manager over today and let her know how I felt. It is for her own benefit that I tell her there are serious problems in the kitchen."
Bishane M.,"Newark, CA",0,1,,1.0,7/30/2016,"I was ordering 4 cheesecake slices to go and this white bitch cashier had the audacity to ask ""you know they're not half priced right?"" Like I can't afford them mofo cheesecakes I knew there was a promo goin but damn she asked like I'm her bitch No Had me waiting so long for my mofo cheesecakes until I actually mentioned ""Where's my order"" and she just started to pack She thought I can't afford 4 mofo $7-$8 cheesecakes, bitch I smell like money One star bc mofo cheesecakes but no star for customer service"
Sergei B.,"Palo Alto, CA",469,102,,1.0,1/27/2016,"One star for arrogance, neglect of customers and violating city noise control regulations. They have loudspeakers OUTSIDE of the restaurant, constantly blasting loud music that contaminates two blocks each way. Why do they think they have a right to impose their musical tastes on everybody who sits in an another cafe nearby? Repeated verbal requests to lower the volume ignored..."
Melissa P.,"Tracy, CA",0,3,,3.0,7/10/2017,First of all my food was pretty good but service was very slow even though we did have a big party. Kids asked for burgers but no sauce and ended up getting ketchup on both. Well they're picky brats and wiping it off wont do so we just politely asked them if they could fix it up for us. But they just seared over the burger and hoped we wouldn't notice..? I guess? Idk if that's a technique or what not but yeah the burgers came back with ketchup still so by now I was like whatever its cool. But others in the party are a little stubborn including the kids and urged them to try again. Of course it came back with ketchup and by now the burgers were almost reaching well done and everyone else was close to finishing. So I just grabbed a butter knife and cut off the sides with the ketchup problem. (Honestly should have done that in the beginning) We ended up getting a free cheesecake desert so that's cool.
Roy M.,"Palo Alto, CA",0,6,,2.0,6/24/2017,It took us a really long time to get noticed by any of the waiters and waitresses. They ignored us. It took a while for drinks when we ordered. When the kids got the pasta one said there was a pea in it the other said they found a piece of penne in bowtie pasta.  The lemonade was good. The coffee was cold.  Service was slow as it took a while to get a kids menu after we asked.
Abhinav G.,"San Francisco, CA",2,21,,1.0,9/17/2016,Ran out of their bread and Veggie Burger at 10pm. Who runs out of bread at Cheesecake Factory
Kathy A.,"Woodland Hills, CA",2,6,,1.0,2/14/2016,"So disappointed here today. Service was fine (nothing special, but not the worst we've had). We shared a bbq chicken pizza that was awful! The crust was cardboard, not cut all the way through, and wouldn't even cut with a knife on the plate! Then, found price stickers on the bottom of our water glasses that rubbed right off. If those had been through a dishwasher even once, they would be gone or mostly gone at least. Yuck! Didn't send the pizza back, they were busy and we didn't want to wait for anything new. Wouldn't have even said anything except someone who said they were a manager when asked delivered a second glass of wine. The waiter said his name was ""...Johnny?..."" , so not sure if he knew. When we told the ""manager"", he thanked us for bringing it to his attention, then....didn't do anything!  We did eat the pizza, so I didn't expect anything off the bill, but how are you not going to offer or bring without offering a CLEAN glass of water???? Mind you, he knew we weren't leaving right away, he had just delivered a glass of wine! (We had also ordered cheesecake.) Seriously??? Truly first time I had something at The Cheesecake Factory that I would never order again, but that was a bad experience that could have easily been made better with some customer service training of the ""manager"" in question."
Cynthia M.,"San Francisco, CA",43,436,75,3.0,2/15/2015,"I came here for brunch on a Sunday at 10:30am, and it was pretty empty. I was surprised because I've never been to Cheesecake factory without having to wait. Apparently if you want to be immediately seated, you should come before lunchtime. I've gone to many different Cheesecake Factories in different cities, and this one was pretty comparable to the other ones that I've been to in regards to food. Our waitress was really nice, and she made sure we had everything we needed. As a con, although we were one of probably 5 tables filled, it took a pretty long to get our food (over 30 minutes). This may have been because we were one of the first tables of the day, but it was still pretty long. Complimentary Bread (4.5/5) - Sadly, one of my favorite things about coming to Cheesecake Factory is the bread. They had both the signature brown bread and a Sourdough baguette. Pretzel Crusted Chicken (4/5) - The pretzel crust made the outside very crispy, and the chicken itself was juicy. It came with two different sauces, which looked homemade and were tasty. The presentation was also nice. They arranged the chicken strips in a lattice pattern. Loaded Baked Potato Tots (2/5) - These were just wayyyy to rich for me. I guess Cheesecake Factory is known for their rich food, but the potato part of these tots had A LOT of cheese in them. Serving them with sour cream on the side seemed like overkill."
Steve K.,"Palo Alto, CA",0,6,,1.0,1/4/2016,"I've been to Cheesecake Factory plenty of times in plenty of locations.  This particular location is one that you should stay away from (Palo Alto).  The owners should be embarrassed and corporate should look into punishing them. We arrived and were told there was a 10 minute wait.  Went to the bar, grabbed drinks, and waited to be buzzed.  Our buzzer buzzed and we went to the host station only to have to wait another five minutes while they sorted out which of the currently doing nothing hosts could actually accomplish the feat of directing my family to a table.  Servers stopped by to chit chat.  A manager came and somehow made it an even longer process. We get sat. (Yay!)  I chit chat with my family.  I read through the entire menu (if you've been to Cheesecake Factory, you know how long the menus are).  I read through the ads on the menu.  I realize that we've been at the table for lord knows how long and nobody has even stopped by our table to even say ""I'll be with you soon.""   I got to play the ""I need some attention"" game with servers passing by left and right, but none would pay attention.  Finally I managed to grab the host that sat us so he could find us a server.  Five minutes later... We order our food.  I decided to take the opportunity to run across the street to Apple and have something taken care of.  I walked over there while most of my family waited for food.  Turns out the line was long.  I waited.  I finally got taken care of and walked back.  I was sure my wife would be upset and my food would be cold.  Nope.  No food. After a while, two plates of food came out.  A reasonable amount of time passed and nothing else.  A few more minutes and I see the same person who delivered the first two plates come into the room.  He had someone else's food.  My wife points out that the people at the table next to us (who have been there a good 25 minutes at that point) have not been helped.  The people behind us are bent out of shape because they got ignored as well and one of there dishes was completely inedible.  (Pasta just completely soaked in oil) I'm flabbergasted.  Three more plates come out.  My poor wife.  No food for her.  We wait patiently.  Finally I had to stand up and get in front of our server and ask the question ""is my wife going to get food tonight?""  10 minutes later my wife finally got her food.  Fresh from the microwave. Did a manager ever come talk to us?  No. Did the server make sure we were taken care of?  No. We had to steal silverware from an empty table. We had to deal without ketchup for french fries. It took 5 minutes to refill my drink.  Which would have been plenty of time if my drink wasn't taken from me to refill it in the first place. I was so proud of my kids for not making a fuss for the entire meal.  They deserve medals.  We had one saving grace.  We had ordered an entire cheesecake at the beginning.  Now that it was an hour and a half later, we could eat it as soon as we got home. I arrived at home and opened my cheesecake...   They gave me the wrong damn cheesecake! The woman behind me never did get a satisfactory meal.  They left in frustration.  The family next to us eventually did get served... after I mentioned to both our server and the host who eventually got us our server.   Honestly, there are some great options in downtown Palo Alto.  Epi, a few doors down has great food and great service.  Nola is solid as well a few blocks away."
