Carol G.,"Palo Alto, CA",8,160,7,4.0,11/6/2016,"Had not been to the Cheesecake Factory for quite a while because the portions were too overwhelming. Checked out their online menu and decided to return for a Sunday brunch. It was great. Husband had eggs Benedict and thought they were very good. I had the lemon Ricotta pancakes and I loved them. Also had side of bacon which was perfectly done. Waitress was friendly and efficient. We will be returning. They seem to now have a fair number of small plates as well as calorie-conscious menu. Good for you, Cheesecake Factory."
Yazan S.,"Hayward, CA",37,35,15,3.0,5/24/2015,"I like cheese cake factory. They have good drinks, burgers, and steak. The service is always good.  keep in mind parking sucks here. 3 stars for this cheese cake factory"
Raquel H.,"Mountain View, CA",2,2,1,1.0,2/26/2017,"If I could give it no stars I would. The place was completely crowded and we had to wait half an hour for a table. Our meals took 2 hours to get prepared and one of them was the wrong order while the other was cold. At the half hour the manager came to talk to us, and us only, that there had been an incident and our meals would take a little longer. Meanwhile, another table that had arrived at the same time as us, if not later, had been given their meal and left. The waiter then went to mandatory break?! And we were assigned a new waiter. Then this waitress never appeared except once to tell us that she was our new waitress. Then we sat there waiting and waiting for our meal. The old waiter reappears and asks us how we're doing. We reply ""Not so good"" And he nonchalantly says ""I'm sorry"" and rushes off! Talk about ""Customer Satisfaction"". Finally, the first meal is brought. After 2 hours may I add. It's alright. The next meal is the wrong order and it takes another 20 minutes to get the waiter's attention. Then another half hour to get it changed. We came here hoping to dine at a nice family restaurant and were greeted with the worst service and below mediocre food. Do not waste your time like we did and come here."
Holly B.,"Palo Alto, CA",205,70,178,5.0,7/30/2015,You really can't go wrong with Cheesecake factor we must have been a hundred times in various places and never get bored! Always new menu items but the classics remain!  Keep it coming cheesecake my true comfort Food!
H D.,"San Mateo, CA",0,4,,5.0,11/6/2016,"Very friendly environment and enjoyable service from Ngan, and staff, she give us a warm welcome and best service. Love Hibachi steak, Miso Salmon ...all foods are upper hand than other Bay Area store."
Brandon M.,"Belvedere Tiburon, CA",20,38,3,4.0,11/26/2016,"I can see why this place has(time of reviewing this) 3 our of 5. First off the interior decor is 100+. However, my girlfriends rice in her soup was crunchy because it wasn't cooked enough, but it was really good tasting. My sandwich was great too. So my review may fair higher than most. I haven't been in too many places better looking. That alone is worth the visit. Go try it."
Alyssa B.,"Alviso, CA",506,469,880,3.0,2/14/2015,"I like the food at The Cheesecake Factory, but service is noticeably slower at this location than at the Valley Fair one. I went here on a Tuesday night, and was seated immediately, but it took 10 minutes to be visited by a waitress. She was apologetic, but this type of service spanned through the entire time we were there for dinner. Service was friendly, but when it's a Tuesday night and there are not a whole lot of people there to begin with, it'd be good to get in and out a bit faster. As far as food goes on the very extensive menu, I can't recommend anything beyond the four cheese pasta simply because I never order anything else. I love that pasta dish, and the staff is always very kind about processing my request for the angel hair pasta substitute.  I'm sure I'll be back regardless of my complaint."
Benny H.,"San Jose, CA",2026,1460,8032,5.0,4/28/2014,"Only three stars really? What the?  Not sure why it's so low or what the deal is with most people, but I've been here a dozen times and all have been realtively great. Huge selection of food and drinks and great crab cakes. Great crab cakes!  Amazing desserts to top it off. This place ain't bad and it's in the heart of Palo Alto near Stanford. Can't complain that much about that."
Mel M.,"South San Francisco, CA",0,19,4,1.0,1/2/2016,"We came here on Christmas Eve and surprisingly they were busy! Our waitress/bar tender (we sat @ bar, still full service menu) was busy but was friendly with checking in with us. Unfortunately, that night one of the servers who brought us our bread accidentally dropped the bread from our basket into the table while holding another basket of bread. I figured, well maybe just maybe he'll apologize and offer to give us the other basket of bread to us.  Well, not only did he NOT do any of the above, he grabbed all the bread that fell into our table with his hands, and placed all the bread back into our basket and hurried away!!! Okay, funny right? Well not really because if I were him - YOUR server @ Cheesecake Factory on a busy night, AND did THAT to YOUR food, handled your food without any gloves or type of sanitation, you would probably be shocked and appalled by their lack of professionalism. Well, if you think that's acceptable, then hey, you can eat anything that they serve you with dirty hands right in your face. I think management needs more supervision or training of all employees regarding safety & cleanliness. Maybe a health or food inspector could drop by...just saying."
S O.,"San Mateo, CA",0,16,,1.0,2/12/2017,"I usually don't like to give bad reviews, but they processed our payment in 30 minutes, ended up overcharging us, and told us to call them next day."
Nestor G.,"Redwood City, CA",48,254,1,1.0,10/14/2015,"I never thought I would do this, but after 240 posts, I am giving my first 1 star review. However, I'm not surprised that it is a chain. Let me give the low down: in order to qualify for a one star in my book, you really really need to fail in all aspects, which is the food, service, and price. This place did it. So, let's begin the journey! The only good part was the beginning. The host was cool and sat us immediately. This is a warm Sunday lunch with my folks. Our waitress came and greeted us nicely. She took our order, but after that, things fell apart and went south. We got our food late.... And pretty cold. We figured that the food was already made, but it just took a while to get it. The fish tacos I ordered barely had any chipotle sauce. I had to ask for more. The beans and rice were warm, not fresh and tasteless. The fish tacos, fried, were not hot and just lacked flavor. No seasoning, nothing. Cabbage was almost non existent in the tacos. My moms garlic sauce pasta was not hot as well and barely had any sauce. She asked for sauce and never got it. Waitress forgot. My mom didn't like it. My dads chicken pasta was probably the best, but that's not saying much. And the bill: $50 for terrible food??? No thanks. We didn't make a fuss, we were just disappointed and I wished my mom wasn't so impulsive in picking a chain, but, we had to do what my mom wanted.  Overall: Terrible food, Terrible service, Terrible price"
Raina S.,"Santa Clara, CA",10,22,17,5.0,4/17/2016,"Great experience overall. I like the service, ambience and food altogether. It was totally worth it. We ordered few drinks and starters that was affordable and delicious at the same time."
Minhthao N.,"Elk Grove, CA",1,14,17,4.0,12/22/2015,Four stars because: -Super cheesy pasta -Great service -Exceptionally cute waiter with a dope polly tattoo Minus 1 star because it was way too dark for my taste. I could hardly see the menu.
Eric C.,"San Bruno, CA",4,34,1,1.0,7/27/2016,"Took my family to dinner on a wednesday night 2 weeks ago.  Quick summary:  food is poor + service is bad First after we're seated within minutes the waitress keep on asking us to order drinks, I'm like let me take a look at the menu first, then she reply back it's just drinks. I don't know how they train their waiters but this is not acceptable.   then order some appetizer, calamari and some nachos.   The calamari is so dry and overcook, and the nacho pretty much has no cheese in it. Never had appetizer this bad, even food truck taste better.   Main course, we ordered a few steaks, it's alright but taste too heavy.   Well , save your money and go to gordon biersch or something, way better.   I cannot imagine the quality difference between this cheesecake vs the one in san francisco.  The one in SF is a LOT better"
Xuan C.,"San Francisco, CA",1697,375,437,4.0,5/12/2016,"So good, but the calories make me feel so guilty! The calamari seem a little to crunchy, and greasy for my taste. Also I hate parking in downtown Palo Alto."
Carlos G.,"Brooklyn, NY",9,198,12,3.0,9/4/2016,"Service is decent, but the food is highly variable. Either it'll be decent or you'll want to return it. Large portions do not make up for ""eh"" quality."
Joan J.,"Atascadero, CA",0,4,,2.0,4/17/2017,We stopped in the night before my husband had surgery as we do not live by a Cheesecake Factory.  It was 7:15 Easter night.  The service was not good and our food was not hot although the taste was great!  We were so disappointed as we have always had great service and food at everyone clear up to Seattle!
Louis X.,"Fremont, CA",2,73,10,2.0,10/1/2016,"Went there on a Friday afternoon, only one girl was serving for 4 tables. The service was pretty slow . I ordered avacado egg rolls and orange chicken, Orange chicken didn't taste good. It was full dry."
Nancy P.,"Mission Viejo, CA",246,54,49,4.0,2/27/2016,"Yummy herb crusted salmon, calamari and strawberry lemonade! Those are the only items I EVER order at any Cheesecake Factory. I usually get the asparagus traded out for green beans, but I decided to keep them this time and I was not disappointed! I don't really like asparagus, but they cooked it very well plus they were huge! I enjoyed it so I'll probably be keeping them in my order from now on.  Service was good, not great. Lost a star because the bread took forever to come out and she also forgot an order of cheesecake + cream for coffee, even when asked."
Rachel G.,"San Lorenzo, CA",1,5,,1.0,1/3/2016,"Disappointing overpriced dinner. Table not set for the 5 in our party, even after a 25-minute wait; ""I got this"" said the waiter. Slapped fork, knife, spoon and dish on the table, no napkin. Appetizers arrived, still no napkins.  Fish and chips were tasteless and limp, and cole slaw was lukewarm instead of cold and crisp. Iced tea flavorless... And what happened to the Paradise Tea they usually serve? Had to wait far too long for side of ranch to go with BBQ pizza; over browned meatballs looked line they were weeks' old and tasted the same. But waiter kept saying, ""I got this"" when all he got was a micro tip. Cheesecake could be redeeming? Nope. Standard cheesecake with 5 pieces of sliced strawberry. Less than 1 whole strawberry. Sigh. Sara Lee from a box would have been more satisfying.  $130 bill for a meal and service worth $20. It'll be a while before I return to The Cheesecake Factory."
