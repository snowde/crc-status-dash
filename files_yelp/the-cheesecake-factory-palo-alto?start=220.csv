David G.,"Palo Alto, CA",0,10,,1.0,11/25/2016,"In addition to Palo Alto, we've been to Cheesecake Factories in LA, Beverly Hills, San Jose, and elsewhere. Generally they deserve 4 stars. But today's experience lowers the rating of the Palo Alto location to only 1 star. We arrived 25 minutes after opening time. No one was in line, and 95% of the tables were empty. Nevertheless, we had to wait 5 minutes to be seated because of a lack of staff. We waited another 30 minutes for the food. The chicken was only lukewarm. The shrimp was overcooked, possibly leftover from yesterday. The kid's grilled cheese sandwich was burnt, and it contained a piece of lettuce. The trash bin in the men's restroom was overflowing with paper towels. The two women in our group reported that the women's restroom had an overpowering odor of vomit. When one of them reported the smell to the hostess, the reply was ""We know. It's the sewer."""
Kristin C.,"Menlo Park, CA",206,251,541,3.0,5/7/2014,"I usually visit the Cheesecake Factory for two reasons. One, if I'm craving some heavy cheesecake and two, to eat the chicken madeira.  I personally prefer lighter fluffier cheesecake but when I'm in the mood for some creamy cheesecake, I'll come here to get a slice of fresh strawberry cheesecake.  The slices are a bit pricey but they are generous with the whipped cream.   The chicken madeira is my go-to entree and it is absolutely delicious.  I'm always satisfied with the sautéed chicken breast drenched in madeira sauce and a side of asparagus and mushrooms. Service at this location is decent."
Cathleen C.,"Cupertino, CA",0,1,1,1.0,5/15/2016,"This is the most unreasonable Cheesecake Factory I've been to! The waiter was friendly and the food was mediocre, but the customer service was AWFUL.  I left my credit card at the table and went back to retrieve it within 15 minutes, but the manager refused to give it back because I didn't have a photo ID.  I explained to her that I had at least two non-photo IDs and can have the waiter corroborate that I was the customer who'd just left (which he did), but she insisted that they are required by law to see a photo ID.  When I pressed further and asked which law, she said ""Cheesecake Factory law.""  Seriously?!  Her decision to uphold the Cheesecake Factory law as oppose to being considerate to her customers  resulted in an entire wasted afternoon for me as I'm not local to Palo Alto and had to drive 40+ extra min to get the ID. There are many many good restaurants on University Ave; we can definitely do without this one."
Gia D.,"Venice, FL",0,14,6,4.0,8/7/2016,"I ate here last night with my boyfriend and we explained at the beginning of our meal that we had somewhere to be in about an hour. Our waitress, Taylor, was so amazingly receptive to this! She totally understood and despite the restaurant being super crowded and busy, we were out within the hour. She was extremely considerate and had our food out as quickly as possible (we ordered three appetizers, fish and chips, and cheesecake).  She definitely made our experience here better because the service was so great. I was very impressed. The food here was great too. The fish and chips weren't the best I've had, too mild a flavor and the batter wasn't what I'm used to, but The Cheesecake Factory isn't necessarily known for it's fish and chips.  I would recommend this place to anyone for sure. Great for families or people who just want a fun little night out."
Andy B.,"San Ramon, CA",5,100,291,3.0,6/4/2014,"Man, what happened to the food quality at The Cheesecake Factory? When I was younger, I loved eating their fettuccine alfredo with sun-dried tomatoes and chicken. I don't really like it anymore now. The emulsion from the alfredo sauce would separate and I would get a nasty, deep yellow oil resting at the bottom of my to-go box when I would go to reheat my leftover. Service was fine. Host and waitress couldn't have done a better job. I just wasn't impressed with the food. Neither was my cousin. We both liked the fried macaroni and cheese balls, but everything else about our dishes just didn't have much of a taste. Maybe I should try another dish the next time I come to another The Cheesecake Factory, but I don't think I want to anymore. Another thing was that their cheesecakes leave a nasty ""chemical"" burped up aftertaste. Like the Red Velvet cheesecake tasted good, but after a while, you get tired of eating it all since the ingredients taste so dull from the overload of ingredients added on. It's as if everything is filled with processed stuff like preservatives to keep the flavor present. They even removed my favorite Oreo cheesecake and replaced it with a grosser version called the Oreo Dream Extreme cheesecake. Ew. Drop the prices of the food to how they really taste, which is average. We're really paying for the environment, name and the pretense that this is an established and trusted restaurant."
Karma K.,"San Francisco, CA",2,170,5,2.0,1/24/2016,"It's a Cheesecake Factory so the menu is the same as everywhere else - lots of options that work for anyone including gluten free. But the service is horrible. They don't have enough servers. We called to say we were coming in with 9 people - 3 high chairs. Said they can't do anything until we get there. We get there and they say we have to wait and no high chairs.  We order and after half an hour, we ask what's going on because our toddlers are melting. Waiter says they are out of bread.  I find another waiter to ask ours for the check for my family and they drop off the check for the whole table. Everyone else is eating but our kid is starting to melt so we want to leave. We would have preferred to pay with card but we left some cash. After food delivered and other than dropping the check, we didn't see our waiter - no how is everything or anything.  The food was okay but we won't be back at this location."
PP G.,"Santa Clara, CA",0,107,16,4.0,10/27/2014,Food is always good and consistent. Ordered the Louisiana chicken pasta and the chicken scampi and they both were delicious.  Service is slow but the waiters are usually nice. Will come back for more pasta!
Cindy S.,"Palo Alto, CA",9,26,22,3.0,8/17/2014,"Usually when we come to the Cheesecake Factory we experience the same problem - we've been sitting at our booth for 45 minutes and there has been three families that came in before us that is almost done with their food. Our waitress is hard to reach and the food is pretty okay. I had the orange chicken and my friend had the pulled pork sandwhich. It was good, but for $16 I think I will get something else next time.  On the upside, their cheesecakes make up for everything, it really is delicious!"
Ivan R.,"Atherton, CA",38,2,,1.0,5/8/2016,Its service was worse than a dennys we had to wait 3 1/2. Hours to even get a table and even after we got a finger nail in our food uh!
Grey R.,"Los Altos, CA",346,590,10734,3.0,3/2/2016,"Just below average overall. Yes, I know this is a chain and I know the menu is more extensive than smaller restaurants, but I had my hopes. It's a nice location on University in PA, after all, and it's convenient. We just didn't enjoy our meal as much. Kinda bland tasting, not at all exciting. It doesn't even matter what we had. Nothing was, as they say it, to write home about. Slow service and sort of indifferent on the staff's part. Overall it felt like a fail instead of satisfaction, like you'd regretted you even went there. Totally not worth it. Next time, definitely pick another place. Another long time until I come back here to see if anything has changed."
L O.,"Redwood City, CA",0,7,,5.0,5/22/2016,"Food is great as always. Service was wonderfully exceptional, served by Ngan. Thank you for the wonderful and genuinely caring service you displayed! Definitely deserves the five stars alone just for her!"
Paula H.,"Carmel, CA",0,2,,5.0,7/29/2016,The people writing these reviews must be among the terminally disgruntled.  I have dined at the Palo Alto Cheesecake Factory numerous times.  On every visit the food has been great and the servers attentive and friendly.  Not one complaint here!
Tf G.,"Sunnyvale, CA",0,3,,1.0,10/30/2016,"I came for lunch at 2pm, ordered a steak. At 2:20, they served me the bread; at 2:26, the steak arrived."
Rick S.,"Sunnyvale, CA",189,242,1182,5.0,5/15/2014,"This location has really good food and good service, during lunchtime. My group purchased too many dishes to list here but, we enjoyed all of them, as well as thee cheesecake. If I'm ever in the area, I'll go here again."
Chandra D.,"Redwood City, CA",62,467,659,3.0,4/17/2014,"Cheesecake Factory food is pretty good, but the service can be hit or miss. This combined with the terrible parking options is enough to make me avoid this particular location. The portion sizes are enormous. Every time I go there I tell myself, ""This is why you're fat."" I try to split with someone if I can. They also have a ""Skinnylicious"" (I think) menu where the portion sizes are actually normal. They also have several low calorie options. Okay. My last visit: I wanted a Chinese chicken salad, so I called and placed my order at 10:30 a.m. The guy said my salad would be finished by 11:45. I was taken aback, but said okay. After I got off the phone I looked at Yelp and realized that the restaurant didn't open until 11:30. That made sense. The problem was that I would have to kill time! I went to Nordstrom Rack and at 11:30 I made my way over to Cheesecake. Imagine my surprise when I showed up and they had ZERO record of me calling and placing my order. HOW RUDE! Thankfully, it didn't take too long for the guy (Sean) to race back to the kitchen and place my order.  I got my salad about eight to ten minutes later (10 minutes longer than I wanted to wait, but....#firstworldproblems), and bounced. If you're looking for things to try: --Buffalo blasts are great (appetizer) --Chinese chicken salad --Chicken samosas --Thai lettuce wraps --Spicy cashew chicken --Jamaican black pepper shrimp Good luck!"
Chris S.,"Palo Alto, CA",1,6,,1.0,10/9/2016,"I took my family of 5 for my birthday tonight and had one of the worst experiences.  To start off with, we sat for 10 mins waiting on our waitress to show up.  She finally arrived and asked us for our food order without even giving us a chance to order our drinks or appetizers.  The appetizers were just ok, the tai wraps average, and the crab dip horrid.  The meatloaf was old and nasty tasting.  Before our main course arrived, I had to bus our table because she didn't clean our table beforehand.  My son is gluten free and we specifically asked for gluten free bread on this burger and of course they brought bread with gluten.  We all finished eating when my son finally received his new bun and burger.  The waitress asked for deserts and I asked for the check.  She came back and offered us one free desert from her manager.  Wow, cheapskate cheesecake factory.  Strongly recommend avoiding this place at all costs!"
Vicky R.,"Daly City, CA",1,18,4,1.0,4/3/2016,Ill rather go to the Hillsdale location .... The host did not say a word; very rude tossed the menu. Wish I would have gotten her name to complain. The waiter did not come to check on us after we received our food. The wait there is around 30 mins. If it wasn't mandatory I wouldn't tip. The only positive thing is the food. Silver ware was dirty.
Marie R.,"Menlo Park, CA",13,2,,1.0,9/26/2016,"I went with my family to Cheesecake Factory for dinner this evening. Our dinner experience was so underwhelming, I cannot understand why people like this restaurant. To start, I checked in with the host stand and was told there would be 5-10 minutes wait. While we waited a number of parties were seated that had arrived after we did, but they were bigger parties and I wasn't worried. After three different parties the same size as ours were seated I went to check on how long our wait would be. Two different staff people checked the computer and the tables, and I was told that the computer showed we had already been seated, to which I replied that we were still waiting (right under their noses). After a few minutes of scrambling we were taken to a pair of empty tables that the hostess pushed together for us. Once we were seated our waiter was pleasant and competent. It took us a while to order, and even longer for our food to arrive. We started with the roasted artichoke, which was lovely. The beet salad with goat cheese was overly salty - who salts beets? My kids both ordered hamburgers which were adequate, though much too charred for their taste. My husband had the chicken Bellagio, which was tender but not particularly flavorful. He also had a side of asparagus, which consisted of six pieces of asparagus, which seemed skimpy. I had the Thai glazed salmon, which was served on a bed of rice with mixed vegetables. The salmon was moist and nicely cooked, but the glaze and the vegetables were so heavily salted they were pretty much inedible. The rice was completely bland, so I scraped as much of the glaze off as I could and just ate the salmon. I also ordered the ""oven-roasted broccoli"", which tasted like it was boiled and then tossed with some cooked garlic - there was nothing roasted about it at all. I know that I've mentioned the overly salty problem a couple of times, so I think it's worth mentioning that I don't have a problem with salty food, but most of my food was so heavily over-salted that it was really unpleasant. The ambience is noisy, the overall service is nothing great, the food is not very good, and the prices are much too high. We won't be going back."
Varsha P.,"Hayward, CA",968,38,460,5.0,5/25/2016,"This place has value for money! The ambiance is awesome and Scott our server was absolutely fabulous, he even warned us about the big servings because we were ordering way too much!! The desserts are to die for !!!!!"
Cindy W.,"San Mateo, CA",14,50,61,4.0,11/15/2015,I like the place is so big and can host any party... Food is good too... Great location on university ave... Easy walk...
