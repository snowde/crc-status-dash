Sue Ellen E.,"Santa Clara, CA",364,515,355,4.0,1/16/2014,"We've been here twice in the last couple weeks prior to seeing our movies at the Stanford Theatre nearby. The service is phenomenal and keeps us coming back. The servers are so friendly and helpful it's unreal!  I love their balsamic dressing for their salads. Their chicken soup -- forget exactly what it's called but it was the Sunday soup -- is very delicious. The fries are wonderful.  I recommend the mocha if you're into coffee drinks. But I wouldn't get another sandwich here. The turkey sandwich was served on a roll too hard for me to get my mouth around and it was oozing with lots of mayo. I had to eat it with a fork but didn't get very far. It fell apart and I gave up.  This is a great place for atmosphere, if you like to take pictures. You don't have to dress up but if you do, the fancy surroundings support that. The tables are nice and big so you can dine with groups easily here too."
Jessica Y.,"Palo Alto, CA",88,201,644,3.0,7/20/2015,"I've been to this chain in various states before, and I'm a fan of Cheesecake Factory in general. However, this particular location has slow service and somewhat long waits. We came around 7:45 pm for a double date and waited about 20 mins before being seated.  Ambiance is intimate, but somewhat loud. They always provide bread with your meal- I really like the darker honey wheat bread. Menu is extensive, which can sometimes be problematic if you are indecisive like me lol I ended up ordering steak medallions on the skinny menu (Cheesecake Factory is know to be highly caloric). Steak was tender and decently seasoned. Mashed potatoes were totally lacking though- it was more like a thin layer at the center of the plate under the steak. I was able to finish my portion, but most of their entrees tend to be very large. I think they basically downsize the meal to fit their calorie limit on the skinny menu. We ordered artichoke dip to share, but it never came. Apparently, they ran out of artichoke dip and our server forgot to notify us. We got a blueberry cheesecake to share. The cheesecake at Cheesecake Factory is perfect every time-definitely save room for dessert if you come here :D Parking in downtown PA can be a bit problematic, so you might need to park a few blocks down to get spot. Cheesecake Factory can be pricey, but it's comparable to other restaurants in this area."
Julia G.,"San Mateo, CA",260,238,535,3.0,1/10/2014,"This time, I've tried avocado appetizer, Shepherd's Pie, and original Cheesecake. Avocado appetizer was cut in odd uneven pieces, but tasted ok. Shepherd's Pie portion was humongous, but so damn salty... Come on... The only good thing was the Cheesecake itself. At least that."
Teo L.,"Stanford, CA",0,7,12,4.0,11/5/2015,"Very tender and tasty steak with sauted mushrooms and onions. Comes with mash. Its good! Nice interior, great service, nice original cheesecake."
Ruthie V.,"San Jose, CA",454,685,125,3.0,6/15/2015,"In the heart of downtown Palo Alto, we settled for this place because we were all on special diets.  Bf's mama had the veggie burger, I had the beets & goat cheese salad (the chopped apples were horribly tart and I left them on the plate), the BF had a cobb salad.  Everything was decent as most CF food goes."
Melissa Y.,"Garden City, NY",1,48,8,1.0,3/11/2016,"We ordered fizzy water to drink with dinner. Not the kind that comes from a bottle, like San Pellegrino, no. Regular fizzy water from the fountain that costs $1 per bottle from Safeway. They charged us $3.25 per water!! That means we paid $6.50 for drinks when all we had was water + CO2. Same price as free refills on Coke..... we pointed it out to the waitress and she said there was nothing she could do.  Unbelievable!!!! Really disappointed in this location of a chain I usually love."
Sarita B.,"Palo Alto, CA",113,24,11,2.0,6/3/2016,"Food was amazing. However, today was a very special day for my brother since he graduated from high school we decided we would go to The Cheesecake Factory. The wait to be seated was only ten minutes, not so bad. However, after we were seated and all 7 of us had decided what we wanted to eat we continued to wait....and wait....and wait...34 minutes later we noticed another table of 7 was seated and right away attended and another table party of one was also attended right away. We sat with no water, bread or server. So I finally got upset and went to the front desk to figure out what the issue was. Of course, once I stood up FINALLY Someone noticed I was very upset, they brought water and bread to my table. However, no one asked us if we were ready to order, so we had to FLAG down a server and he finally attended us. He was very nice but the wait, the lack of attention and even the lack of customer service didn't really make this experience at The Cheesecake Factory worth coming back. I've come here before and the customer service has always been amazing I don't know what happened to this place."
Colleen K.,"Menlo Park, CA",187,54,71,2.0,6/12/2015,"The venue itself is beautiful, Cheese Cake Factory restaurants are always very clean and elegant, but there is a few issues.  First, the lighting. It is way too dim! So dark it is actually hard to read the menu. So that part annoying.  Secondly, the food is always too salty or over seasoned. It's sort of a hit or miss type restaurant with what you order sometimes it's good sometimes you think you won't be coming back.  To not only nah on Cheesecake Factory, there are se highlights to eating here. Large and noisy crews can dine here as it is a loud place. It's family friendly. The drinks (alcoholic) are strong.  Lastly, ALL CHEESECAKES ARE DELICIOUS!!"
Linda T.,"San Francisco, CA",6,49,77,1.0,12/17/2014,"----------------------------This review is for the Bakery Dept. only-------------------------------- Very unprofessional, incompetent, irresponsible staff. I called few days ahead to see if I can order/reserve a Lemoncello Cream Torte whole cake for , the staff said there was no need to order/reserve, they have it in stock. NOTE: I was not offered the option to order/reserve in advance even when I requested to reserve for one. When I went into the store to get the cake and asked if they can write a Happy Birthday sign, the cashier said: Sure. So I paid the cake at 2:32PM and did not get my order ready until 3:05PM. The following happened during the 30+ minutes of waiting: The chocolate plate sitting on the table untouched while the two staff started chatting, joking, fooling around...(The restaurant was practically empty) Then a lady started writing something on the plate but something went wrong so the guy started wiping off the writing with a wet rag.... The guy tried again using the same chocolate plate and quickly slid the sign inside my plastic bag so I wouldn't notice it. I took a glance at it and almost died of horror...the writing was worse than a 5 year old! I told him this was unacceptable; His response/excuse: ""You know, it's really hard to write this""  Really? That's your lame excuse? All the bakeries can write, but it's too hard for you? I don't mind waiting for 30 mins. if the final product is acceptable, but to wait 30 min. for a 5 year old's writing? that's absolutely unacceptable. The manager then came out to apologize and his excuse was that it takes a long time to write the sign and that I should have called to pre-order. I told him that I did called to to reserve but no one offered to take my order.  Either the staff was not properly trained by the management or they don't care/appreciate having a job. Either way, this is my first time stepping into the Palo Alto cheesecake factory and it will also be my LAST time."
Luxirie C.,"Palo Alto, CA",0,6,,3.0,5/29/2017,waited in this line for a cheesecake SLICE for almost 20 minutes!! horrible service they are so slow... but i love the food/cheesecake here so oh well lol.
Jesse S.,"South Gate, CA",130,3,2,1.0,12/20/2014,"While visiting from Los Angeles, I wanted to grab some lunch so I walked in. I was seated within seconds, I'm like awesome this should be quick. I waited 10 minutes before someone came to the table, no I'm sorry for the wait. The server then asked what i can i get for you? I said ""I'm ready I want a coke and a chicken Marsala"" she then replied ""great, would you like some brrad and butter while you wait"" i then said ""yes, thanks"".  15 minutes later no coke no bread and butter, and no server. After 30 minutes wasted i walked out."
Nikita G.,"San Francisco, CA",220,66,18,3.0,12/14/2015,"The initial service is fast but the main course took really long too come (could be because it was too crowded at 10pm too). The portions were huge, well done. The cheesecake delicious as always. The server friendly."
Sable S.,"East Palo Alto, CA",14,24,46,5.0,5/12/2015,"Background: I was craving their cheesecake and I've been many times on the east coast. I was a solo diner. Experience: I went on a Saturday evening around 7:30. The hostess seemed a little busy handling other things while 2 small groups were waiting in front of me. She finally addressed them and then when I was next in line she walked away. She came back a few minutes later and I asked if I could sit at the bar (I probably could have jus walked to the bar without notifying her, but that felt weird). I sat at the bar and the bartender quickly gave me a menu. I ordered a cosmopolitan (they are also amazing at the Cheesecake Factory). The bartender made it satisfactory.  Food: I ordered the chicken potstickers and the Macaroni and cheese. For dessert I had the low carb cheesecake with strawberries. All the food was amazing and the low carb cheesecake almost tasted like the real thing.  The two male bartenders were great! However, there was a female server who could not stop cursing for the life of her (I mean I curse but not at work!). The male bartender realized how loud she was speaking and told her to keep it down, but she didn't. Overall my experience was just as amazing as the food! I will definitely return. Note: I wish they had designated parking!"
Anila Y.,"Raleigh, NC",101,405,331,1.0,11/22/2013,"By far one of the worst dining experiences ever. There are plenty of nice dining places in the vicinity, so do not resort to this option.  We came in literally at 8pm on a Thursday and there was a 30 minute wait. Because we were desperate, we decided to stay.  We were finally seated, and the service was automatically horrible. We were a party of six girls in our 20s--I do admit that some of the guests at my party were being obnoxious, but I think it was more in retaliation to the ""off-the-bat"" rudeness of our server. I wasn't even given a napkin with my silverware. Attention to detail, people! Finally, the food was horrible. Between the 6 of us, not a single dish was appreciable. The vegetarians at the table got: Evelyn's pasta which was bland and undercooked, spinach and artichoke dip which, again was bland and the chips were thick and oily. Not restaurant style like we hoped for. Lastly, the pear and blue cheese flatbread. Flavor-wise it was good, but it came sliced once, and we asked them if they could take it back and slice it again, and we were met with a rude ""It was sliced in the kitchen"" by our server. Lastly, we got NO water refills after having asked repeatedly. As for the ambiance, after dinner, I felt so uncomfortable and claustrophobic that I had to leave the party early and go outside for fresh air.  Will not be returning to this, or any other location of the cheesecake factory."
Julie A.,"Mountain View, CA",0,26,17,2.0,5/8/2016,"I love the menu at Cheesecake, there is quite a variety to choose from. We went Sunday around 4pm so we were seated right away, however, I had to request napkins at our table, we had utensils provided but no napkins. Our food finally arrived after 30 min or so but during that wait our waitress didn't stop by to ask if we wanted more bread or inform us how much longer it would be. Our food finally arrived & our waitress continued to be inattentive so although I enjoyed the food, service not so much. When we were done with our meals and desserts it took maybe 20-30 min before we saw her again to request the bill. So, I realized that the reason people are often waiting so long to get seated may be because of the delay the waiters/waitresses take to provide customers with their bills to get them going, so that the next patrons can be seated in a more timely manner."
Elena S.,"Palo Alto, CA",152,15,3,1.0,2/8/2016,"Terrible place, 1,5 hour waiting time, taking an order -45 minutes, double mistake in order, we were waiting a glass of water another 30 minute.food is edible but service is very bad."
Jeep D.,"Harbor Springs, MI",1,10,6,4.0,9/16/2015,"Huge portions, if you want to eat a lot come here. The food was flavorful and it was fast. The only problem was the lighting. It was already dark inside and once it got past a certain time they closed the shades. That made the darkness even darker. But overall it had good food and solid service."
Lucy R.,"Mountain View, CA",0,5,,1.0,8/10/2016,"This was a HORRIBLE experience. It was extremely slow and my waiter did not listen. My salad came with the wrong dressing. I asked for a side of fries and they gave me a TINY amount. Most cheesecake factories give you a basket. The service was inexcusably slow. They also did not serve bread when they bring drinks, which is what they normally do. Very disappointed. Save yourself, and don't go here."
Daniel M.,"Redwood City, CA",0,4,,1.0,2/27/2015,"I ordered a large takeout order today for lunch. I ordered the Jambalaya Pasta which is my only favorite dish at the cheese cake factory. I was so disappointed! the flavor of the food was what I expected, however, I have never eaten pasta soooooo over cooked. I thought the pasta was made out of clay. It was totally inedible. Just gross. I had to eat just the chicken and shrimp so that I wouldn't starve to death the rest of the day.    Every one else said there food was alright nothing great."
manho w.,"San Francisco, CA",8,5,5,2.0,3/31/2016,"Ordered skinnylicious burger with medium cooked but they totally burned patty, so I couldn't eat."
