Gregory S.,"San Diego, CA",302,33,11,2.0,11/6/2015,"These 2 stars are for one very specific reason: they blast hits from the early y2k years. It's not only way too loud, it's also terrible music. Corporate food trying wayyy to hard."
Laura H.,"San Mateo, CA",223,7,16,1.0,10/31/2015,"I have been to many Cheesecake Factories before, many, and my experience here was eeek! Our server, I forget her name seemed stressed and unfocused. ( I myself am a server so I can understand.) The food was horrendous. I ordered the Smoke House burger and I couldn't even begin to eat it, it smelled so bad, (the bun). My friend ordered the shrimp, it was dry, really dry. My boyfriend ordered the tamale cakes, ewww! And why are the plates hot? I don't get that? I think because the food is already pre-cooked and just sits there. Everything must be frozen if it tastes that bad. I won't eat here again or any other Cheesecake Factories."
Miss R.,"Palo Alto, CA",0,27,6,4.0,1/13/2015,"Love this place..it's very busy sooo sometimes you may have to wait. But come on, it's clean, good customer service, great food! So for me it's worth the wait. And they are pretty good at accommodating seating for large groups and if they goof on something usually they are pretty good on making it right. :) If your in a rush it's probably best to go somewhere else, if not stay and relax :D My fav- the salads, and oh that chicken costelletta YUMM. And the cheesecakes well they are PERFECT!  Tip- tiramisu cheesecake. Perfection."
Lily T.,"Westfield, NJ",5,148,157,3.0,2/28/2016,"Ok, this really hovers between2-3 stars. I know this is a chain and pretty much know what to expect food-wise bathe menu is huge and the place is nicely decorated with a relaxing ambience. We ordered the meatball ricotta cheese appetizer and after waiting Iike 20 minutes it came out cold. That was rather disappointing and we sent the food back. The manager came right away to apologize and said they will fix this immediately. Our food eventually came (after some wait) and no signs of meatball. The manager came over again and explain how it take too long to reheat them through, and offered to buy us our drinks and dessert by that time we just didn't care about the appetizer anymore. I still give them three stars because the service was good and they were sincere about the apology. However they do need to hire more staff since the service was quite slow. Food was overall good though."
Pushkar A.,"San Francisco, CA",8,47,,3.0,1/18/2016,We came here for a team lunch. This place has a great ambience but slow service. Being a Vegetarian I didn't have much to choose from so I ordered a egg guacamole cutlet which was simply amazing and a Falafel salad which was way too Americanised that it lost its essence. Rest of my non-vegetarian friends were satisfied but not delighted. We ordered various cheese cakes for the team which were nice but really really heavy. This place is a bit pricey too.
Yun C.,"Palo Alto, CA",401,679,1050,5.0,6/20/2013,"Seriously, ""cheesecakes,"" what not to love???!!! Ok, FIVE STARS definitely for their CHEESECAKES!!! as I never had any cheesecake that I don't like from the Cheesecake Factory :). Came here last night with 25+ people for a birthday celebration. The servers were super nice and very accommodating. I never wait tables BUT I'm sure it was quite a challenge to serve such a large group!  We got two servers but the male server (don't know his name) who was in charge of my section was SUPER NICE and ATTENTIVE. He's either a latino or filipino (dark hair, dark skin) wearing glasses. I ordered my water with no ice and when the water arrived it had ice in it. I didn't want to make a fuss about it and didn't complain but when he noticed my water with ice, he quickly said, ""let me grab a new glass of water with no ice in it."" WOW, with such a crowd, I must say that I was impressed that he remembered! I was trying to be ""good"" so that I would feel less guilty devouring on cheesecake for dessert so I opted for the Mexican Lettuce Wrap from the Skinnilicious menu (less than 490 calories). I must say that I was very impress with the freshness and the flavor. $6.96 for three fairly large lettuce wraps with large (generous size) chunks of chicken, avocado, tomatoes and other fixings. The chicken was flavorful and seasoned well. The tomatoes and avocado added moisture to the white chicken pieces so they didn't feel too dry (the common issue of white meat!). I must say that for a person with a LARGE stomach, the portion was pretty good to fill me up despite the no-carb on the plate. I did devour three slices of the ""free"" bread with butter before hand though, so maybe that helped ahhahahahaha!!! For dessert, I opted for the 30th Anniversary Cheesecake and I was EXTREMELY HAPPY with my choice! The cheesecake was delicious!!! It wasn't too sweet but yet rich and creamy, the way $7.95/slice should be huahauhauhauh! The edges of the cheesecake had crunchy chocolate chunks that added that extra texture, yummmmmm!!! I licked my plate clean, literally!!!!! and yes, I finished the whole piece by myself (well a couple of my friends sampled my piece but I also sampled theirs, so I think it evens out!). The best thing of all was that the whole meal (my portion) including tax and gratuity was $20 which is nearly unheard of when dining with a large crowd in a nice restaurant in downtown PA! Another gf  (she didn't have cheesecake), only spent less than $15!!! wow! Well, we both did order from the ""appetizer"" section so that kinda helped our pocket...but we were full at the end of the meal!! The cheesecake factory is certainly a great spot for dinner and DESSERT! yummm!"
Mike P.,"Newark, CA",0,3,,1.0,7/18/2016,"This place is horrible.  Long wait, no service bad food.  Please close the restaurant and hire new staff and train them all properly."
Francisco S.,"Mountain View, CA",2,47,1,1.0,7/23/2016,I got food poisoning!  Here is my story.  I ordered the pork chop dinner....30 minutes later a manager comes up and says that the rest of my party's order will be out but he didn't like the way the pork chop looked and he is having the cooks cook a bit longer so your food will be a little late.  I said no problem.  about 15 minutes later the manager brings the chop out and he stands there watching as I cut into the chop.  It is raw and he immediately grabs it and apologizes and says he'll be right back.  About 10 minutes later he brings the same chop back and I eat it.  2 hours later I'm at home and the next thing I know I'm on the toilet puking my guts out!  I puked every 30-45 minutes for the next 6 hours.  I also had diarrhea but not as bad as the vomiting.  It so bad that I couldn't keep water down. After a few hours I was puking up stomach acid as that is all there was.  I didn't sleep a minute all night.  The next day I felt terrible as my throat was hurting from all the stomach acid and I even busted some blood vessels in my eye's because I was vomiting so hard!  I said never again.  I wish I knew what they did to my chop in the back.  I bet the cooks thought that I was the one doing the complaining and they found a way to pay me back.  If they only knew I hadn't complained once.  The only thing I'm thankful for is that it only lasted 1 day.
Anna P.,"Los Angeles, CA",233,473,1191,4.0,10/9/2014,"It's a Cheesecake Factory, and what they do best is KISS (Keep It Standardized, Stupid). I've been to many Cheesecake Factory locations and I feel that the experience is pretty much the same everywhere. The wait isn't as bad as at the other locations, but that may be because people can't find parking and because I personally end up coming here pretty late at night. The service is slow and courteous, as usual. They do a great job remembering the substitutions, in fact this particular location substituted rice for a salad, which I am very grateful for. The drinks menu is pretty classic and they do not water them down, even though they don't taste strongly of alcohol."
Theodore M.,"Chicago, IL",51,34,53,5.0,4/24/2015,It's Cheesecake Factory.  What else do you need to know.  We got seated right away.  Staff is checking in on us for our order quickly.  We had bread on table and our drinks inside of 5 minutes!
Michelle M.,"Belmont, CA",197,1852,605,5.0,11/10/2014,"Hands down, this is the best Cheesecake Factory I've ever been to for lunch.  Why?  Because I went during what should have been the lunch rush, and was seated as soon as we walked in.  Had a wonderful waiter.  Food was fresh.  Prices are the same Cheesecake Factory prices from that huge menu bible...but!, taking in all the wonderful factors I'd come back here with my friends again for lunch time.  Not sure what dinnertime is like???"
Jenny W.,"New York, NY",17,538,133,4.0,11/1/2014,"I've never associated the Cheesecake Factory with food I would like. But I was pleasantly surprised when I discovered that all my prejudices were wrong! The bread is brought out nice and warm, and it's quite good as well. The miso salmon was AMAZING, it was so buttery soft and paired well with the miso sauce. I want to say that it may well be one of the top 3 salmons I've ever had. So good. Plus I got it as a lunch special for like $14.  Can't attest to any of the other food, but the miso salmon is all that I need."
Watchmicook M.,"Irvine, CA",56,303,153,3.0,4/8/2015,"I've had better jambalaya at cheesecake before but today was not the day.  But the cheeseburger things, calamari and obviously the strawberry cheesecake were delicious. Our server, Miranda, was attentive and pleasant.  Overall, a good experience."
Christina L.,"Palo Alto, CA",71,134,350,3.0,8/23/2014,"In all honesty, CF is a very dependable establishment for any casual date or family meal. The bread is usually warm, and the selection of entrees is good and plentiful. Just beware that everything here (drinks and dishes) is sweetened to downplay their overtly sweet desserts. This particular location is a smaller version of what you'll find at Westfield Valley Fair.   On our last visit, we arrived in dusty, sweaty hiking gear. We had just clambered up Mission Peak, and were in dire need of beverage and sustenance. There was absolutely no judgment on the servers' parts about how we were dressed. Should you find yourself in a similar post-exercise stupor, I highly recommend the Georgia Peach as a starter.  Service is always attentive, particularly when we sit at the bar. On a late weekend afternoon, the bar is usually empty. This is where you can find Justin, a rockstar bartender and server. We usually start with drinks and dessert before making it to the savory dishes.  Appetizers of note: crispy crab wontons, guacamole made-to-order (lemony fresh with a side of pico de gallo), and the fried calamari.  Standard entrees: grilled pork chops, fresh grilled salmon, and miso salmon. Just be careful not to burn your entire mouth like I did on the miso salmon. That sucker must have been sleeping under a salamander broiler, as it was still smoking after I had taken three very well-spaced bites. Warning next time, please and thank you?  Desserts, hers and his: chocolate tower truffle cake, lemon raspberry cream cheesecake, and fresh banana cream cheesecake. What's your poison? Note that this location always has the AC on full blast. I always exit with a desire to thaw out in the sunshine. Even the tap water in the ladies bathroom is cold. Is this a tactic to get customers to eat and leave quickly? Brrrr!"
Alex A.,"San Jose, CA",54,16,8,2.0,9/21/2015,"Incredibly slow service. Inefficient operations, and staff that is less than helpful."
Eitan S.,"Palo Alto, CA",1,2,,3.0,12/27/2014,"Ordered orange chicken:  Didn't like the meal at all. Chicken was too dry and rice was unnecessarily covered in cilantro. I should've expected an over-gourmed meal on something so simple. Not worth the price.  Ordered mushroom burger: The burger was a little too salty for my taste. The mushrooms gave off a strange aftertaste. The burger itself, however, was pleasant. The fries had a distinct taste of oil but were well done overall. The service took a little while for such an empty restaurant. Our server was nice but did not come around often enough"
Divya K.,"Stanford, CA",217,56,51,3.0,11/25/2014,"What else besides cheesecake? This is a review from a cheesecake-hater.  We go to cheesecake factory for desert  sometimes after grabbing dinner elsewhere, on the University Avenue, 'cause all my friends love cheesecake.  Being a cheesecake-hater, I always take either milkshakes or chocolate truffle or strawberry shortcake. I find all of them a little too sweet or a little too chocolatey - my threshold is quite low for both.  But, yeah, I go here again n again : my friends love it."
Mina A.,"Palo Alto, CA",0,1,,1.0,7/11/2016,"If I could give this place minus-10 stars I would. The worst service I have ever had in a restaurant EVER. This made me compelled to write a yelp review (which I never usually do). Arrived at 9 pm on a not so busy Monday night.  1. Had to ask for Bread, burnt bread was given to us. Never got offered bread again. 2. We ordered 4 dishes to be brought out at the same time for 4 people: 2 were brought out after 25 minutes (that's great), then we wait 45 minutes and had to remind someone we had additional orders so they then bring the third dish out. After 1 hour we ask where our 4th dish is and the waiter forgot we ordered it, went to the kitchen and then came back 20 minutes later to tell us they forgot to cook it, asking if we still want it without any apology???! We were 4 hungry people so obviously said yes- it took another 30 minutes to bring it out. 3. By this time we asked 2 people if we could speak to the manager- both disappear and don't come back. It took the MANAGER 45 minutes to come and talk to us, not really apologizing. She said she would go to the kitchen, find out what happened and come back. No sign of her for 25 minutes! Go to the front desk to find someone to talk to since our waiter basically doesn't do his job, and she is at the bar!! 4. They give us the check which has an item on there we didn't even order! Worst customer service ever In my life. Avoid this place unless you'd like to wait 2.5 hours for cold, forgotten food and want terrible service! It's a shame because I really like the Cheesecake Factory but won't be going back to this one."
Madhur B.,"Stanford, CA",190,225,489,5.0,3/3/2014,"Love this chain. Obviously the cheesecake selection is obscenely massive, and all of them are unique & delicious. But the actual food selection is just as impressive. Here are some recommendations: Appetizers: Avocado Egg Rolls - Excellent. On par (if not better) than BJ's version Chicken Taquitos - Honestly my favorite taquitos that I've ever consumed Entrees: Spicy Cashew Chicken - A bit sweet and spicy, my favorite dish here Cheesecakes: Dulce de leche - Simple, classic. My go-to Reeses peanut butter cup - RICH. Definitely bring a team to split with Chocolate raspberry - I always love that pairing"
roy g.,"San Bruno, CA",1,24,4,2.0,12/2/2015,"By far the worst service . The food is ok , but if it takes 20 mins before your server  can bring you the bread , everything goes down hill from there ."
