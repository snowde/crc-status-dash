Martha Stuart H.,"San Jose, CA",21,152,8,5.0,4/11/2016,My server gave me the best service ever. I will be back soon. I have to come back to try all there cheesecakes there are so many. I can't wait ..
Ma Teresa Concepcion A.,"San Jose, CA",14,7,1,2.0,3/20/2016,"We waited 15 mins to be seated because they forgot that we're on the line and then waited another 20 minutes for the bread starter which is suppose to be ready 5-7 mins after we seated and ordered then another 20 minutes for our food to come ,never experienced this kind of service at the Cheesecake Factory by the oak ridge mall, there's not even a lot of costumers only a few but very slow service"
Tony S.,"Sparks, NV",0,50,,4.0,7/5/2015,Positive: Great food and great desert. Price is just about right. Negative: Service needs to improve soon. 1-star only.
Lillian Z.,"Sacramento, CA",461,369,1427,4.0,3/3/2012,"I've eaten at quite a few Cheesecake Factories, but this location was my very first one, and in all the years since my first visit, it hasn't changed much... but in a good way! This location gets really busy at night, but when I went here for lunch recently, it was surprisingly empty, which was a nice change. Whereas in the evenings, it's difficult to flag down your server and get his attention, at lunch, our server was super attentive (and friendly and not stressed out!) I looove the miso salmon. My roommate recommended it to me on one trip, and I've been enjoying it ever since. The flavor of the salmon is delicious-- just the right amount of sweet, without being too overwhelming. I've also always been a fan of their pastas-- I'm pretty sure I've tried almost every single one on the menu-- and have never been disappointed. I tried the cajun jambalaya pasta on a whim once, but it is so good! And when they say SPICY, they're not lying. I'm also really partial to the bread they serve here, especially the dark brown variety, which my friend once thought was ""chocolate bread"" (sadly, no...) The passion fruit mojito is also quite yummy. Of course, the cheesecake here is fantastic, but I usually am so full by the time dessert comes around that I either pass, or take the cheesecake to go! tl;dr: Cheesecake Factory is Cheesecake Factory-- all with similar looks and tastes, but that won't stop me from coming here whenever I crave that miso salmon! (or cheesecake!)"
Annie L.,"Cerritos, CA",3,88,127,4.0,1/31/2016,"Why are people hating on Cheesecake Factory?? It's got everything you could possibly want to eat! Plus they stay open really late. I went on a double-date here at 11PM on Saturday and received excellent service paired with perfectly made food. I got the Chicken Madeira, my other half got one of the burgers. Both of us were so happy with our food. Probably helped that we were super hungry. He used to work at this very Cheesecake location and yet he still likes going back. That's a testament to what a solid place this is. The other couple shared a meatloaf, zucchini fries, and 2 cheesecakes. They were really happy with their orders too. Full stomachs and smiles all around :)"
Ruby S.,"Los Altos, CA",14,7,,1.0,11/15/2015,"The one star is for the store manager on duty Friday night on Nov 13, 2015.  If I could I would give him MINUS 5 stars!! Six of us had a big family dinner around 6PM there.  My nephew ordered the teriyaki chicken, a piece of meat with deep wide burned and charred marks was delivered.  So we told the waitress if she could replace it.  She came back and told the store manager rejected and said that's how it should be cooked.  However, the waitress was nice and said she would take it back and let my nephew order something else.   A few minutes later, the store manager showed up at our table and questioned us in a very RUDE tone.  He told he eat it like that all the time without any problem.  We told him it's overdone and burned like a piece of hard charcoal, we never had teriyaki chicken cooked like that in any other restaurants and don't like it that way.  He was not happy and asked my nephew in a very rude and impatient tone on what he ordered again.  He said he wanted to make sure my nephew understood the menu and should not be surprised when the food was delivered.    God, we were all very mad that he basically ruined our mood for having a nice dinner there.  We eat out very often and this is the first time we encountered such RUDE store manager treated his customers so unprofessionally.   It's a big shame this name brand chain restaurant has such store manager to chase away his customers!!"
Danny N.,"San Francisco, CA",1,182,87,2.0,10/20/2014,"We have not been having good experiences at this Palo Alto location. We live in between the San Mateo & Palo Alto locations.  We usually choose Palo Alto because we like to walk on University Ave afterwards. However this location's service is not very good. Very long waits are expected, but the food and service has definitely changed from the Cheesecake Factory we loved to dine at. Used to be our favorite place. Maybe management has changed, but it's too bad."
Jorjann J.,"Tualatin, OR",55,55,89,5.0,3/2/2015,"Good service. Cuban sandwich was very tasteful with the combo of pork, ham, Swiss cheese and pickles."
Allyson Y.,"Sunnyvale, CA",6,69,7,2.0,7/13/2015,"I've been here twice and the service is slow! On my most recent visit, we arrived around 10pm for a late dinner and were seated right away in the bar area. Our server took about 10 minutes to ask what we wanted to drink and took another 15 minutes to bring out our water at which time she finally took our order. She was slow at waiting on all of the tables in her area and was forgetting to bring straws, drinks, boxes for leftovers, but of course she didn't forget to bring the check accompanied with an insincere smile in hopes of getting a decent tip. Nuh-uh! At around 10:45, we finally received our order. The fries that came out with the chorizo omelet were stale and cold and my chicken lettuce wrap tacos didn't have the avocado cream that was supposed to make it more flavorful. For about 15 minutes our waitress disappeared and I couldn't wait that long to ask if she could please bring a side of the avocado cream. I decided to eat my bland food because I was already starving and couldn't wait any longer. Not once did our waitress check to see how everything at our table was. We had to ask another waitress to refill our waters because ours was nowhere to be found. Once we finished our meal, I had to walk up to the bartender to ask for a box for my leftovers. He asked another server to bring one, but that took another 10 minutes. Our waitress reappeared so we finally asked for our check. She finally asked how everything was and we told her about the fries. She said, ""Oh, I'm so sorry! Would you like me to bring you a new one?"" Ummm no but if you had cared to ask about 25 minutes earlier how we were doing it would have meant more. She never asked if we wanted to get dessert, which we originally did but lost our craving for cheesecake when their service was so poor. Overall, she was not warm and friendly, offered slow service, and did not follow up with any of the tables in her area. I thought I saw a manager walk by, but he didn't seem to pay attention to the row of tables that were suffering from our slow server. I hope other customers don't have to experience this poor service. There are many other Cheesecake locations I will visit before coming back to this one."
Paul G.,"Pescadero, CA",18,293,4,4.0,8/28/2014,"This store was awesome.....We were on a time crunch, so we sat in the bar.  Our waitress was wonderful, she smiled, made us laugh, and was very prompt refilling sodas and water.  The food was great, and of the cheesecake factories, this is my favorite"
Josie N.,"Union City, CA",25,42,2,1.0,10/13/2015,"I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs for my daughter and me to share at lunch today. Not only was the sauce was bland, but the meatballs were undercooked. They were raw (not just rare) inside. I was so disgusted."
Henry K.,"Vineburg, CA",0,26,,1.0,11/10/2015,"I visited the Cheesecake Factory restaurant in Palo Alto on Nov 3rd. Although I've been to several Cheescake locartions across the US and overseas, this was my first visit at this particular location. All I can say - AWFUL, AWFUL, AWFUL. Service was terrible, or non-existent. Food was not up to standards, and they even ran out of items (first for me at a Cheescake). To top it off, I sent an email to their customer service dept, and did not even get a reponse. Do not recommend"
Jenny M.,"Mountain View, CA",250,372,211,4.0,7/1/2015,"This is a good place to take picky out of towners that are afraid of new food experiences, but want to go someplace kinda nice-ish. They do not take reservations so be ready to wait around awhile. The food is okay, the portions are huge. The staff is fine, not great, but adequate. Everyone is going to find something to eat because the menu is extensive. I'll be back with visitors."
Gabe G.,"Cupertino, CA",5,15,4,1.0,8/16/2015,"Service. And how they think about their customers, that's why the lowest rating. I left a pair of Oakleys on the table as I was leaving. Happened with me many times in the past at other places. I always got it back from the wait crew. Never in my file heard ""it's not here, nowhere to be found""."
Danielle D.,"San Francisco, CA",88,81,69,3.0,6/7/2014,"I've been to many Cheesecake Factories (and by many I mean like about 25 times in my life, mostly in Pittsburgh) and was never very impressed or felt the urge to review my experience there. This particular trip changed that. My boyfriend and I were walking down University Ave around 10:45 p.m. and EVERYTHING was closing down so we grudgingly walked to The Cheesecake Factory. Thankfully, we were seated immediately and had two very friendly, attentive waiters take care of us.  We initially wanted spinach dip and they were out. The waiter suggested crab cakes. Their crab cakes? AMAZING. I'd never pin them as having spectacular crab cakes, but they were delicious. They melted in your mouth, but we're breaded to perfection. The cakes were plated beautifully (too distracted by their deliciousness to take a picture) and the two dipping sauces that came with the crab cakes (one cold, one warm, both some sort of tartar) were dutifully cleaned up by us with bread. My only critique is that there were only three.  So if you're walking down University Ave around 11 and want a place to sit and eat, go here for the crab cakes. And cheese cake, naturally."
Beth F.,"Santa Monica, CA",0,23,,1.0,11/25/2016,"I can't speak to the other 364 days of the year, but I can state with certainty that the day after Thanksgiving is NOT the day to visit this Cheesecake Factory. Holiday under-staffing led to under-cleaning and over-cooking today. We waited to be seated, though the restaurant was almost empty. We waited for our food, though few others had ordered. We received three dishes, all of which had problems (one was cold, one was burned, one was overdone to the point of infinite chewing). We then visited dirty bathrooms. The women's room was a particular menace; it smelled so strongly of puke that most people in there were trying not to ... puke. All in all, this was a Cheesecake Factory to remember, but only because we want so very, very much to forget. It's diner beware on this one, I think. We'll keep going to the others, as they have been so much better. But this Cheesecake Factory? Not for the faint of heart."
Emmet G.,"Union City, CA",0,7,3,5.0,11/4/2015,"The waiter I had was literally the best waiter I've ever had. I didn't get his name, but I wish I had. He was so nice and got us whatever we needed without delays. He was in a rush but never made us feel like he was.  The food is also so good. I've been looking for a truly satisfying meal for some time now, and I finally felt good after eating here. It's also not that expensive. Really reasonable and they have good sized portions. I had a lot to bring home :D The interior is so beautiful as well and is the major factor of why I loved this place.  Overall I'm so extremely happy after my visit and will definitely be coming back and recommending it to anyone wanting a great place to eat."
Colleen S.,"Redwood City, CA",218,20,3,3.0,11/3/2015,"eh what can I say, it's Cheesecake Factory. food is good and cheesecake is delicious. interior is pretty. standard Cheesecake Factory.  the service at this one is lacking. our server never introduced himself just asked for drink orders and started to walk away before I could finish. came back took our dessert order, dropped it off and never spoke a word. he later (15 minutes) came to box our food and give the check. it was a very disconnected evening with the server. odd. the host was great though!  but overall it's fine. I like cheesecake."
Karen R.,"Sacramento, CA",0,5,,4.0,2/17/2016,"Ok, its a chain. I get that. We've eaten at quite a few. This one was memorable enough to actual rate. Normally they are a 3 star option. solid but nothing amazing.  This was definitely one of the better ones and deserve some recognition. Hubby and I were in town for a conference and they were open when other places weren't so we gave it a shot. Service was a solid 4 stars. Food was good and well cooked. I am a bit finicky and wanted some substitutions and they got them all right. I would be back if in the area. Too far away to drive from Sacramento though."
Lauren K.,"San Francisco, CA",390,553,2093,4.0,9/9/2011,"Looks way smaller than it actually is. I thought it was a super mini version of the cheesecake factory in downtown san francisco. boy, was I wrong! It seems like it's about the same space-wise. I tried the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta and specifically asked if they could do it non-spicy... like at all... The waiter thought for a second and said it wasn't a problem. It was spicy. Not even a little spicy. It was very spicy. I know, I know. I should have expected it, after all it is jambalaya. Service was excellent. I'm always walking away satisfied. :) Waiter never complained and was super friendly. It was my friend's birthday. Too bad they don't give you a complementary cheesecake. But if you do buy a cheesecake, they'll sing for you!"
