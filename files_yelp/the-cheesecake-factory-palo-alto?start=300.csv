Jasmine X.,"San Francisco, CA",788,1085,1443,2.0,7/17/2012,"Cheesecake Factory is definitely a classy place and I've been here on a few formal occasions, but I'd sadly have to say that I'm never going to be back at this location at least. The food here is alright. I've gotten their Hawaiian Pizza and Evelyn's Favorite Pasta. Both dishes are decent and are pretty large portions so it's nice that I can always share my food when I'm at Cheesecake.  Cheesecake Factory, is of course, known for their Cheesecake. Their Oreo Cheesecake is pretty great and definitely a guilty pleasure.  However, mediocre food would normally have gotten it a 3 or so, but I'm going to have to downrate this Cheesecake Factory for it's extremely poor service.  I made reservations for a group of about 20. I don't know if it was because we were kids that they treated us poorly or completely neglected our reservation, but it was absolutely horrendous having to wait three hours to be seated when you were promised reservations. The people working the front were extremely unkind and refused to resolve the issue and just consistently said that it would be a few more minutes. The servers themselves are alright, but having this terrible experience with service coupled with mediocre food definitely isn't going to incentivize me to eat here again. I might get Cheesecake to go... but then again, Paris Baguette is right next door..."
Lauren B.,Silicon Valley,138,60,,1.0,5/1/2016,"Can Tums and Imodium be taken at the same time? I have a feeling I'll soon find out, but let me back up. Came here for a birthday. Restaurant wasn't super crowded (no wait), the service was slow. Our waiter seemed nice but the bussers seemed to be doing most of the work the waiter should have been. It was 45 mins. between the ordering the appetizer and when it actually arrived. Same for the entrees. Drinks took 30 mins. between order and arrival. I ordered a shrimp dish. NOT the best idea as I am now laying in the fetal position on my couch as I type this. With all of the dining options in Palo Alto, I recommend going elsewhere."
Sean B.,"San Francisco, CA",2246,2841,1478,3.0,8/29/2013,"Pretty middle-of-the road Cheesecake Factory. Generally they're a bit better. Particularly in Phoenix and San Diego, the service is actually exceptional. In San Francisco, it's always so busy that it suffers a bit. But this one... it wasn't busy and the service was still a bit sub-par... which, as it turns out, is what everyone on Yelp is saying, so clearly I'm not in the minority.  Decent food. Reasonable prices. So-so setting at this one. Sub-par service. There are probably better options in downtown Palo Alto. Don't think I'd really return to this one."
Bri C.,"Sacramento, CA",33,21,3,5.0,1/12/2016,"Love this location. Party of 4 seated 15 minutes before closing and still received middle-of-the-day type service. Good food, kind staff."
Manny C.,"Union City, CA",42,90,26,2.0,1/12/2014,"The Crab Hash was a big disappointment, salty crab, burnt potatoes and over cooked poached eggs just not not what I would expect based on pass visits. My wife's BBQ salad was good"
Daisy Z.,"Stanford, CA",74,104,264,4.0,9/12/2013,"I think the Cheesecake Factory gets a bad rep just for being a chain restaurant. That being said, I thought about how I would rate this place had it been called something else and that's how I'm writing my review. The food here varies in quality by what you order. Pasta, of course, always comes in large portions here though the quality is just okay. I feel the pizza is the best thing to order at Cheesecake Factory and I have never been let down by it. My friend got the Steak Diane and it might have been the most delicious thing on that table. I came close to closing time and the service was amazing. The waiter was very attentive and didn't try to rush out my large group when it was closing time. The ambiance is really nice and this one has beautiful decorations though I feel is was a little too dimly lit for people to be able to tell. I had trouble reading my menu. That means it was too dark. Cheesecake gets its own category because, duh, that's why I came. I got the Oreo Cheesecake and it might be the better than the Godiva one! All-in-all Cheesecake Factory is solid every time. I think its success is its own worst enemy because it's a chain but honestly, if there was only one of these, which offered gorgeous ambiance, super large portions, and a 2-page cheesecake menu, then I'd drive an hour for this."
Nancy T.,"Morrisville, NC",505,95,313,2.0,8/14/2013,"Came in here last night, hungry and ready to eat. It took them 15 minutes to seat is, no problem. We decided what we wanted to order ahead of time so we wouldn't have to wait any longer. Our waiter was new but friendly. He was handling another really big party but he took our order on time and was courteous.  We got our appetizer and drinks in a timely manner but after that we were lost as to what was happening. 30 mins passed, no entrees in sight. Our waiter checked back on us and he was surprised that we didn't have our food. He went to check what happened and told us we would get our food shortly.  We asked another waiter after waiting another 5 mins, serving the table next to us if he could check how much longer we would have to wait. After 40 mins of waiting for the entrees, the waiter that wasn't even assigned to us brought us our food. Keep in mind this is Monday night at 9pm. I have been here on busier days and the service was so much faster.  The worst part wasn't waiting. I took a bite out of my sandwich and the chicken was RAW.  If it wasn't for the second waiter, I would give this place one star. Never going back again."
Mason S.,"Santa Clara, CA",0,1,,1.0,9/11/2015,"I visited here today for dinner. When I arrived, I asked to be seated for 4 adult and 1 baby. And she said all party should be there. By the way one person was coming from Berkeley, so I asked it should be all the people, one person might be late. She said no, all 5 people should be arrived to be seat. It is sooo terrible service. I think she can say, take a seat first sine only one person is not here. 12 people party cannot be seated until all 12 people arrive? Doesn't make sense!"
Dilenia A.,"Redwood Shores, CA",19,29,2,1.0,8/2/2015,"I'm a bit surprised that for this restaurant to be empty, if it wasn't for my boyfriend who went to the hostess and asked ""where's our waiter"" after being seated for 15 mins, then once he showed up, we placed our orders of drinks, brings it to the table and he drops our drinks...smh he gets us our drinks and proceeded to tell us ""oh you're not going to be charged for the drinks"" to which I replied ""of course not, bc U DID DROP THEM, not us""."
Rose M.,"Princeton, NJ",0,13,,1.0,5/12/2016,"Have been here many times in the hopes that ""maybe next time, they will get"" but nope, that isn't the case!  Horrible service from rude waiters and waitresses to slow service.  On more than one occasion it has taken over 20 minutes to get drinks when the restaurant is empty, appetizers either came out with entrees or not at all, wrong entrees have come out, and we have had to ask for bread and water after being seated and waiting almost 15 minutes. Having visited many Cheesecake Factories, I can easily say this one is the worst one yet."
Daniel D.,"Morrison, CO",0,2,,1.0,9/7/2015,Had to wait for 45 minutes for food to arrive... ended up leaving before it did. The bread was ok I guess... I'm only doing filler because yelp won't let me post my review until it write more.
Julia P.,"San Jose, CA",125,1,,4.0,1/23/2016,I went here with my family to have dinner on Saturday night. The food is usually very good and the serving size is plenty. The only complaint is that the wait was much too long. 45 minutes for Saturday night. Luckily we weren't to hungry. I guess that's what you have to endure if you're going to go out on a Saturday night in Palo Alto.
Nhi T.,"San Jose, CA",64,25,28,2.0,12/31/2015,"I love this place, but today is a big disappointment. I ordered shrimp scampi and steak Diane. The shrimp is ok, but the steak is way too dried. It's like beef jerky not a medium cook steak. I also get the shrimp tempura dynamite, it's like omg, what is this. It's way too too tooooooooo over cook and dried. Is it a shrimp jerky? I just get one bite and leave the rest. So disappointed!!!!!!!"
Sara N.,"San Francisco, CA",273,418,985,4.0,6/30/2014,"Came here for a quick meal before a game and boy was it a good decision!  We sat in the bar area to avoid waiting for a table (and to be closer to the alcohol of course).  The bar was a bit drab, the ceiling was a bit ""corny/cheesy,"" as my colleague stated but it is the Cheesecake Factory... amiright?  Anywho there was a bit of a mishap with the lack of alcohol in one of the drinks.  I saw her make the drink and she didn't even count to 2 before she stopped pouring the shot, eep!  Both my dad and I ordered on the skinny menu, he got the skinny hamburger and I got the vegetable salad, my friend got the chicken pasta dish (I forgot the name). The food was divine, everyone enjoyed it, and the drinks were delicious but a bit on the lighter side.  My second Pina Colada was a bit better so I upped the anti with 4 stars.  The waiter got all of our orders correct down to the last detail, including my dressing on the side and extra lemon for our waters. Overall it was a great pre-game dinner before the San Jose Earthquakes game at Stanford Stadium."
Denise L.,"Santa Clara, CA",971,2304,3723,4.0,7/5/2012,"Out of the Cheesecake Factories I've been to in the bay area, this one has the best service and ambience. Although parking can be a pain since it's on University Avenue, I've never had much trouble. Came here for a lunch on a weekday, and they even took a reservation down for us beforehand. I don't think any other CF's take reservations and was quite surprised we got one! They seated us at a cozy booth that sat 7 of us comfortably. I like how you can order a lot of their items lunch size for a cheaper price. I've also been here for dinner in the past, and enjoyed our service and meal. Food is the same as the other CF's, but I definitley would prefer coming here than the other 2 nearby."
Elisse P.,"Palo Alto, CA",0,6,1,2.0,8/23/2015,"Dined in last tuesday  and I can't seem to understand why this place is always packed. Location perhaps? The weight was ridiculous yet me and my husband decided to wait. As our name gets called me and my husband notice plenty of tables open(which led us to wonder why the wait was extremely long) Once we are at our table were greeted by our waiter(whose name I will not mention) and he asks for our drink orders. 20 minutes go by and still no drinks and no bread. Finally we get our orders in and yet again, we wait for an hour to receive our food. Waste of time. Definitely not worth the wait. Disappointed."
Marc K.,"Cupertino, CA",1328,508,1100,4.0,9/2/2012,"Food, not for me. Cheesecake, great.  I've never really liked their food, no matter what I ordered, but their cheesecake is really good. Yeah yeah, I know, it's called the cheesecake factory so why would I assume the other stuff is good? Well, it's packed with people eating dinner, so I think that many people do think their food is good. However, I have given up on their meals and only show up occasionally for a slice of very creamy, very rich, cheesecake!"
Nataly A.,"Mountain View, CA",0,11,1,1.0,8/6/2015,"Customer service is the worst! take out service is HORRIBLE! We always order take out in our office and they NEVER have the food ready by the promised time.  Always forgetting to include the side essentials, like bread, extra sauce, ketchup ,butter etc.  Food is good but service is unacceptable for such a busy street during lunch time.  We will NOT be ordering take out from this location again."
Paolo I.,"San Mateo, CA",5,57,1,4.0,12/28/2014,We only had dessert. But they were really awesome. Gigantic and really good. The chocolate mouse cheesecake is something you HAVE to try.
Leslye S.,"San Jose, CA",374,147,201,5.0,5/12/2014,Had the ahi tar tar and the miso salmon.  On point!!!!  I also always love their lettuce wraps.
