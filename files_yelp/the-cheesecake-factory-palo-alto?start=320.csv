Giselle O.,"Newark, CA",0,3,,1.0,9/7/2016,"This will be long! So I work in a restaurant myself so I know how it can be with large parties, I work at BJs where it gets super packed. I called a week in advance to make a reservation for my birthday the girl took my number and name down, everything. On our way there we call saying we're running a little late. The hostess says ""that's funny, we don't take reservations"". Wtf? That's funny? I'd be in so much trouble if I ever said that to a guest. We get to the restaurant, the hostess is BRUSHING HER HAIR. At the front desk. With a HUGE brush.., WTF? We wait for about 30-45 minutes to get sat. Our waitress says they can do separate checks but only three and we just say ok sounds good. She brings us water, doesn't ask if we want anything to drink until we called her over. After, doesn't talk to us to take our order for about another hour. (Keep in mind, there's only 11 of us really not big). Then, we have to wait another hour for our food. Food was great, the only star I'm giving. 45 minutes later they bring something out for my birthday. And another 15 to bring to go cheesecake. We finally get the check and it's only one bill.... After she told us and we asked to do three in the beginning? We decide to throw in all our cash and for card, write the last f4 digits and how much to charge, making it as easy as we can. She comes back and says ""we can only take three cards I told you that"" with so much attitude. Like um no you didn't?? We finally speak to the manager who took another 15 minutes and she did it all individually after saying she couldn't. It was all just a huge mess. It was such horrible horrible service and I had wished I gone somewhere else. I work at a restaurant like I know what it's like, even if we dislike a guest, the servers still give it their best. I don't like to be complicated and get the manager but wth?? Our server talked to us about 3 or 4 times the whole damn near 4 hours I was there!!! DO NOT COME HERE. I am very disappointed. I'll just finish this with, THIS WOULD NOT HAPPEN AT BJS."
Emily L.,"Redwood City, CA",312,39,12,1.0,6/19/2015,"Called for takeout, was on hold for more than 10 minutes on the phone. BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE, AVOID AT ALL COSTS!"
Aaron A.,"New Haven, CT",2,7,2,1.0,3/25/2014,"Called to order a sandwich for pickup. I knew what I wanted but was placed on hold. No one came so I hung up and called back, and the lady said, ""Right, we have a lot of people in the restaurant, so he will pick up the phone when he's available."" Really? It's a Tuesday night, and the Cheesecake Factory can't afford enough people to take orders. This place is *always* slow. I've gone there in the middle of the day when the restaurant was completely empty, and it still took over 30 min to get food."
T. C.,"San Jose, CA",6,272,1,2.0,11/19/2014,"Customer Service is really bad at this location... we were seated after we waited for some time... we were given menus... and told someone will be with us soon.. lie! we sat there with menus.. like 30-40 mins. Yes we coulda left but we have  a fuzzy 5 yr old who hungry and thirsty.. and i was not about to wait somewhere  else along University ave known for long wait times.. no one served us water....bread..nothing... we finally flag a waiter down.. who was helping the tables next  to us.. (who were all eating way b4 us but were seated after us.) we get our drinks .. we ask"" can we please place our oder"") we couldn't wait to get out of there.. we all started to get sleepy  from the long wait..  wont be back.!"
Robert T.,"Baltimore, MD",184,143,103,3.0,4/29/2014,"You've probably been to a Cheesecake Factory before.  It's your stereotypical family restaurant chain with a multitude of choices, large portion sizes, and their famous cheesecakes.  I don't normally have meals here, but I always come for the cheesecake.  I've tried many variations from the Red Velvet to the Key Lime to the Original.  Most are quite overwhelming for my liking, but every bit worth it for the taste and creamy texture (there really is no place that makes cheesecake this good).  I'd highly recommend grabbing a slice on the go for dessert and splitting it with a friend or a special someone. The Palo Alto location is a lovely place to grab a bite to eat while exploring University Ave.  It's spacious and has a ton of seating for large groups. The service is acceptable and they do cater to your needs. 3 stars for being just your average Cheesecake Factory."
kathy s.,"Hayward, CA",0,7,,5.0,8/17/2015,"Who would have guessed that you could hold a meeting at The Cheesecake Factory?  Well, let me tell you, it was the BEST work meeting I have EVER been to! Brandon (the Manager)  turned down the music in our area, and made sure we had everything we needed.   Frankly we didn't even notice the other customers!   We had great participation in our meeting, and I'm confident that it was because they felt special to be invited to such a great restaurant.  Duh, you know the food is AMAZING, but it's really a fun place to have a meeting too.  Thank you Brandon for making us feel so special."
Lone E.,"Oakland, CA",63,98,4,4.0,9/29/2015,"great food, good customer service huge fan- seated fast, it was during lunch and it was surprising it was not loud and crowded, but nice and still a mellow setting. The parking was great and the walk there awesome."
Teirrah M.,"Hayward, CA",0,12,1,5.0,1/2/2016,"This afternoon was my first visit to the Factory in Palo Alto and I loved it. The decor was gorgeous and the food was excellent. I ordered the Fiesta salad and shared the nachos appetizer with my table mates. We all had a great time and our server, Eric, was extraordinarily gracious and attentive. I shall return!"
Jimmy J.,"Menlo Park, CA",1,40,,2.0,3/22/2014,"Wow. Never again. Two bad trips in a row.  Tonight:  Food was 'blah' to 'ok'... Certainly nothing to go back for. Only the shrimp summer roll appetizer, my wifes salad, and the french fries had any taste. Service was unbelievably bad. How many f***ing times do we have to ask the waiter before he meets our basic/standard requests. Examples (not a complete list):  1.Lemon for my iced tea (multiple, multiple requests - you would think I was asking for something rare and hard to find),  2. Tea / and other drink refills - we were getting dehydrated waiting 60min for our food,  3. Water for my daughter (he hadn't figured out that he forgot to bring her a glass up front... she got it 30min after we sat down),  4. Table setting for me (another 30min delay. I guess he was planing for me to use my hands)   5. Our freaking food (see below),  6. A box to put in the extra crappy food we didn't eat... I'm really not sure why we took it home... Took forever for him to take our food order (he made about 4 trips to our table, including bringing us extra bread we didn't request, before asking what we wanted to eat). Took 30+ min to get our food - but that was an adventure... My wife, youngest daughter and I received our meals while my eldest kid only got her french fries. Despite repeated reminders, my eldest daughter got her crab cakes 15min later, and my son got his pizza another 10min later - after everyone else had finished.  He kept saying ""thank you, thank you, thank you"" each time he came to our table for the first hr, then ""I'm sorry the food took so long"" during his visit the last 45min."
Ray D.,"Redwood City, CA",0,62,3,3.0,7/17/2014,"Never been overwhelmed by food, service usually good, long waits frequently, and long waits for food even when not super busy also a bit pricey for what you get. Ordered from  the ""Skinnylicious"" menu last time there, chicken enchiladas were  ok, side was a bowl of raw vegetables!  Portion size of regular menu items good. Everything seems a bit "" cookie cuter"" there are plenty of other places in same price range with more character and better food."
Rico S.,"Redwood City, CA",199,23,5,1.0,6/19/2015,"From cursing over hot plates to complaining about a  customer's $18 tip. Horrible service, oversized attitudes and total disarray from management down."
Smooth O.,"Boston, MA",0,27,,2.0,12/10/2016,"We go to Cheesecake Factory a lot especially as other locations have been very good. This one... Not so much. I've had medium rare hibachi steak come out well done, bread and waters forgotten, absent slow service, mistaken orders, and worst, what was likely cross contaminated food for a food allergic kid.  Other cheesecake factory's have been really good about their food allergy protocols. We were told that a side of broccoli was safe for a child with multiple food allergies. It was only as I dumped the food into a takeout container at the end of the meal that I saw not only cooked cardboard, but also a piece of pasta.  Maybe no big deal for most people, but for folks with food allergy, cross contamination can be a big deal.  My kid had swollen eyelids after the meal.  Unfortunately I just can't trust the food to be allergen safe at this location.  The one at valley fair is much better and worth the drive south."
Allister D.,"Sunnyvale, CA",767,1460,1475,3.0,3/10/2013,"This location is pretty decent. Ive been here plenty of times and looks like it remains the same for afternoons at least. I mean there is barely a crowd at this location in the afternoon happy hrs. Now the service is great, the food is great, and just like any other location, it's gonna be the same. I just don't like the quiet people sitting around eating and having to watch 1-2 people sip on the bar by themselves lol Idk, maybe it's just me but these things matter at times to me lol I mean it is the atmosphere experience as well. It doesn't beat Valleyfair's location.  I work on the strip so this location is a plus because i can grab drinks and lunch specials any time I work!"
Hannah J.,"PORTER RANCH, CA",3,16,3,2.0,11/7/2015,"i dont know why cheesecake does so well even though Im disappointed time and time again.... I guess Im part of the problem for always going back.... dont blame me, blame the cheesecakes! They are pretty good.. theyre the only thing that cheesecake does right. but in this case, my hibachi steak was mediocre.... It was even missing the tempura asparagus... im promised some asparagus in the menu description but cheesecake does not deliver... like always...  sigh why do i always give cheesecake the benefit of the doubt, thinking that my experience this time will be better than the last?!? Nope. Any cheesecake I go to delivers the same mediocre service"
T L.,"Los Gatos, CA",0,7,,1.0,7/1/2016,"This review is NOT on the food; the food is wonderful.  This is on the customer service at the Palo Alto Cheesecake Factory only.  I called to reserve a small area for a gathering of about 20 guests.  The person who answered the phone was very nice but he turned me over to Sarah (the Manager).  She told me that they did not take reservations on Saturdays and Sundays.  I asked if this was a new policy and she said ""no it has always been that way"".  I asked her if there was some mistake because I had my birthday gathering here in December 2014.  She apparently did not want to take the time to explain the situation and just hung up on me. This is not something I would expect from the Cheesecake Factory.  I've been to several of these restaurants and their service was impeccable.  What a disappointment!"
Amy B.,"Palo Alto, CA",0,2,,1.0,10/1/2016,they said they would seat us in 20 minutes and it has been 40!!! i am seething!!!!! please let me eat the bread #not #a #happy #customer. they have seated a plethora of large groups before mine and i am exceptionally displeased with the circumstances. do not attend this establishment if you are a fan of being seated for dinner
Tina N.,"San Jose, CA",1007,671,6490,4.0,2/27/2013,"Just like any other Cheesecake Factory, but service was superb. Our waiter, Manuel, was super helpful with my mom's order who doesn't really eat outside our cultural (Vietnamese) foods. He had suggestions left and right, when shot down  he kept going meaning he knew what he was talking about! :) Cousin and I ordered: Strawberry Lemonade $4.50 Raspberry Lemonade $4.50 Fried Calamari $10.95 Hot Spinach & Cheese Dip $10.95 Chicken Sandwich / Caesar Salad $12.50 Cajun Burger / Caesar Salad $12.95 Mom ordered: Strawberry Lemonade $4.50 Lunch Miso Salmon $13.95 Total of $81.25 with tax.  Yeah, I was just recently off my low iodine diet so I went to town. But by the time my entree came out, my cousin and I both took our food to-go. First was the delicious fried calamari. Strawberry lemonade was way too sweet, but I don't have a sweet tooth so next time I gotta tell them to go easy on the strawberry. I thought the spinach dip was going to be similar to Flames or something, but when it came out it was quite small. Maybe I was thinking spinach artichoke. Anyhow, it was still good, a little too cheesy for my taste and had bits of chicken I believe. I tried part of my salad, which tasted like heaven in my mouth and only a third of my cajun burger, which was great, a little on the greasy side though. :/ Other waitress who helped deliver the food was nice as well. Immediately got lemon and soy sauce at my mother's request, which was very nice of her and asked if we needed anything else. Manuel was attentive to refilling our drinks and bringing rounds of water along with bread and butter.  Overall, great experience even with having to cater to my mommy. Great staff! Good job, Palo Alto."
Émilie J.,"Mountain View, CA",0,16,2,5.0,11/3/2015,"We love this restaurant. The food is always great and they have a large choice of cocktails. The last time, our server was very energetic, funny and outgoing. He would joke a little bit which we liked a lot. The avocado eggrolls are awsome, the crab-artichoke dip is very good as well, the beets salad and the ahi tartar as well. We usually order apetizers and share and we have never been dispointed."
Cami W.,"Mountain View, CA",25,14,27,2.0,9/11/2014,"Amazing food, as always, but very bad service. Never got our soda refills, coffee refills finally showed up as we were ready to leave.  I started mentally timing the waitress to see how long it would take her to get to our table for anything. I will come here again, as the food is excellent."
Sergey K.,"Santa Monica, CA",7,40,1,3.0,8/16/2014,"Underimpressed. What you expect from CCF is a solid chain restaurant dining. Staple decor, token lightning and semi-comfortable booths. Food should be ok, you wouldn't expect it to bring you to cloud 9.  Yet, this resto managed to not deliver on all of that. It's in a nice location in Palo Alto, and from outside it looks inviting. Once you come in, you get a wiff of mediocrity.  ...supported by service and food.  Service was spotty. Somehow it was difficult for the server to give us full attn to understand what we wanted.  The good - greasy and way too heavy. Yes, you wouldn't expect this place to give you the most healthful options, but our scallops felt like they were cooks in 3-day-old oil, and artichoke dip was reheated 4 times.  And we sat in a booth that was right next to kitchen entrance. Never a good spot to dine."
