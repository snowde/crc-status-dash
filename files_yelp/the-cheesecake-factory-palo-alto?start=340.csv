Jonathan C.,"Fremont, CA",0,42,2,4.0,10/5/2015,"Went there in an afternoon, so I guess it helped that there weren't too many people. Staff is friendly and helpful. I got a cup of coffee and an Oreo cheese cake. Both are good, and they constantly came to me to ask if I want refill. I like the service. Only problem is probably pricing. haha"
Suzanne N.,"Palo Alto, CA",10,41,16,1.0,11/22/2013,"This review isn't for the food, it's for the to-go service: It's kind of interesting to see how operations work when they first open in the morning. While I appreciate friendliness between coworkers, I don't appreciate the unprofessional yelling in the lobby by Ana, a cashier in the bakery, to what I assume is her manager, Christian, and she was constantly yelling across the lobby at him all the while sipping on a Starbucks frappucino. I was a bit disgusted that this cashier did not have her hair tied back, simply a hat on her head. Her hair was long enough to pull back, and I am a bit afraid of finding a hair in my dessert. Placed a over the phone order around 10:30. I have now been waiting... 30 minutes for it. I wish I would have been told over the phone about the long wait upon walking in. I would have made other plans instead of sitting here in the lobby the entire tip.  Star to the hostess who acknowledged me and offered me a drink. I had to turn it down, but I do appreciate her effort. What I don't appreciate is pretty much being ignored in the lobby until I went up to ask about how much longer the wait time would be. Apparently, the man behind the counter now was a manger or some sort of leadership and he went ahead at explained that they are boxing my order up now. That was 10 minutes ago. If this was my order alone, I would have for sure cancelled my order. Overall: When placing to-go orders from here, place well in advance and show up at least 30 minutes after they tell you to. Only then will you maybe receive your food on time."
Vinay M.,"Austin, TX",113,7,,1.0,1/10/2015,"I'm giving 1 rating because there is no negative rating option. The worst possible service. The waitress Lisa didn't even offer for complimentary bread butter, even after asking twice about it. Finally she came with a plate of garlic bread and added it on our bill. She was very rude"

Richard T.,"San Francisco, CA",50,345,249,4.0,11/8/2010,"I came here for a friend's birthday lunch.  Finding parking wasn't as difficult as it usually is during the weekend in DTPA.  It actually took us longer to be seated than to find parking.   After asking Carlos, our waiter, his recommendation between the Steak Diane with Shrimp Scampi vs. the Salisbury Steak, he recommended the Salisbury Steak.  I think I would've enjoyed the Steak and Shrimp better.  The Salisbury Steak wasn't bad, but it wasn't that great either.  It kind of crumbled whenever I tried to cut it.  The mashed potatoes that it came with were good, but got cold fast.   My friend ordered the Flat Iron Steak well done, but it came out medium rare, so I ended up eating half of it.  The bloody half I ate was pretty bomb.  The fries were good; tasty and crispy on the outside.  If you plan on ordering the same thing well done, ask them to butterfly it or it will probably come out bloody since it was a two-inch thick steak.   My plate was almost as big as the table, causing my silverware to nearly slip off of the table a few times.  It would've been nice if they sat us at a larger table, but it wasn't that big of a deal to me.  Like always, the ambiance was nice.   We came here mainly for the cheesecake, but ended up eating so much, we had to pass on it.  I'll plan further ahead next time and probably get something with chicken."
Peter M.,"SOMA, San Francisco, CA",4,12,,1.0,3/14/2015,"I ordered a chicken sandwich, and the chicken was not cooked all of the way. Service was bad. Gross."
L L.,"Mountain View, CA",0,12,1,1.0,3/21/2015,"Me friend wanted to show this place because he knows I like cheesecake. It's not my place :) Very dirty, too bad deserts, a poor interior. Cheesecakes were too sweet and fatty. Hot chocolate was just water, milk and sugar."
Celeste G.,"San Francisco, CA",1,13,,2.0,5/24/2016,"So, i live in San Mateo and frequent the Hillsdale location, this was definitely an isolated visit and it will remain that way for a very long time unless we happen to encounter a similar situation as we did yesterday, in which case, I will try my best not to go here at all. My sister and brother in law spent the day at Stanford Hospital with my little niece who has recently been ill. Thankfully, she is on the mend but it gave us all quite a fright. They live in the central coast and since we are only 15 min away, we offered to meet them for dinner after work, they were both very tired from a long day and hungry but didn't want fast food. I told them we would head down and get a table and they could meet us there, hopefully we would have their food ready and waiting for them. So we get there at a quarter to 7, I put my name down for a table for 5 and the hostess says, give me 15 minutes.. ok not a problem as my sister and fam were still at the hospital. 30 mins later, a second hostess walks over and asks me if my whole party is here yet as she needs half of us to be here before she can seat us. I explained to her the situation and asked if that would be possible, she said ok and that she'd see what she can do. At this point, we are the only ones waiting for a table. In walks a group of 4 people, they get seated immediately, in walks another group of 3 and they get seated immediately. At this point, I am extremely irritated, if she couldn't do it, then she should say so and we can have the choice of going to a different restaurant. AS soon as I get up to go ask her again, my sister and brother in law walk in, I tell her my party is here and she walks away, the first hostess I encountered tells me she will have us seated in 2 mins. So by now, my family is here, they are tired and hungry and again, we are waiting. I was disappointed with the experience that my food didn't even taste good. I don't feel this was an unreasonable request as it was a monday evening and there was no wait time, plus, I was ready to order food for all of us at the same time. If it weren't for the fact that I didn't want to inconvenience my family and have them wait to eat any longer, we would have definitely left and eaten elsewhere. To top it off, my husband ordered the Shrimp Scampi and the shrimp tasted as tho there was uncooked batter on it, he was actually pretty sick last night and this morning. The only reason I am giving this place any stars is because yelp makes you give at least one, the other one is for the waiter who was kind and patient with us. To the hostess, here's a message, get over yourself and the power you think you have, you are just a hostess."
Daniel A.,"Menlo Park, CA",89,31,,5.0,9/13/2015,"Great Loving Friends took me here for my greatest birthday celebration 12/2009. I never knew how good the art of cheesecake eating and making was until i visited here. The entire restaurant is artfully designed. The lighting is just right and the staff are truly great. I've tried less than half of their entire selections of unique cheesecakes, however individually i'm certain that over time I'm bound to be impressed with the whole menu. The seating is very comfortable and speed of service is just as well maid. I'm certain to entertain many more friends and family for a good time here in the future. This place is sure to satisfy anyone's sweet-tooth fixations."
Rachel S.,"Pleasanton, CA",757,547,284,4.0,1/10/2012,"I feel like the quote ""If you've been to one, you've been to them all"" applies to Cheesecake Factory. I don't mean it in a bad way...it just seems that across the board of all the CF's I've been to, none really stands out. I've never had a horrible experience, they're all ""good"".  Our waiter (whose name I do not remember) was really helpful. He got our order right, made sure our drinks were always filled and was available if we needed anything. This particular location seems a little smaller for a CF, but it is located downtown instead of at a mall.  Until something traumatizing happens at Cheesecake Factory, I'll be a fan."
Coley G.,"Pacifica, CA",28,15,136,1.0,9/20/2013,"Occasionally we stop in for some appetizers and a slice of the crumble apple cheesecake and are pretty happy but this location was the worst. There were only a hand full of people in the bar area when we sat down and it literally took our waiter 20 minutes to even come say hi and give us a menu. Already knowing what we wanted to order we had to wait another 15 minutes just to tell the guy because he kept disappearing on us. Finally getting our cheesecake we had to wait to eat the  dried up old slice because he never brought us utensils!  I must say I was not a happy camper and it will be a long while before I feel like giving this place another chance. If I'm going to cheat and eat some calories ,they need to be worth it!"
Matea F.,"Englewood, CO",20,223,64,3.0,2/19/2012,"5 stars for their Cheesecakes and the selection of those. 2.5 stars for the food and drinks. 0 stars for handling my special order for a wedding I love their cheesecakes. Seriously, if you have not tried them yet -- what are you waiting for? They will rock your socks, and impress any date :) For dinner or lunch tho, go someplace else. These guys are famous for the cheesecake, and the food they make is a-ok, nothing spectacular. Your typical American cuisine (variety of choices, deep deep fried stuff, giant salads that with dressing make up to 1200 cal., etc.). I have been a few times throughout California. Same everywhere.  But, I keep coming back for more -- cheesecake that is! yum yum yum :) P.S.: I have ordered the cheesecakes for a special occasion from Palo Alto Cheesecake Factory and my experience was awful. So just a heads up, give them a call the week before, the day before and on the day off. Which is EXACTLY what I have done (I figured since I placed my order a few months ahead of time it would be smart to refresh). At the pickup they still managed to 'mess up', I got my two cakes sliced with paper dividers between them -- big time No No for my special occasion :("
Hema R.,"Mountain View, CA",29,58,7,5.0,7/9/2015,"This place delivers, every single time. The food is good, the cheesecake is great, and the ambience is very relaxing. The icing is the courteous staff. They make sure you have a good time, every time!"
Stephy L.,"Millbrae, CA",813,199,616,4.0,7/29/2011,"Beware! This review is mainly for their desserts!! Took a day trip and visited Santana Row with my boyfriend.  We were bringing a friend from Taiwan around.  We had a late lunch at Yard House ( needless to say, review coming soon!), so by the end of the night, we decided to skip dinner and just go for desserts at Cheesecake Factory. Thursday night, it wasn't as bad as I thought in finding parking.  Surprisingly there was no line at the Cheesecake Factory.  We arrived around 8pm ish and was immediately seated.  The restaurant was about 70% full.  Not bad for a Thursday night! My friend went traditional and ordered the Original cheesecake with strawberries on top.  The cake size was decent.  The cheesecake was great. it wasn't too heavy, and the taste was just right.  The texture was rather fluffy. I decided to try out their Tropical smoothie, which was absolutely refreshing and delicious.    I think this smoothie itself would served as a great dessert/after dinner drink.  I find this very enjoyable.  It wasn't sour in any way, but it wasn't too sweet either.  All i can say is, it was very tropical. I also ordered the Red Velvet Cake Cheesecake which looks like this :    it was a GIANT piece of cheesecake. I was so excited when I saw this! ( the fact that i've been craving red velvet in forever).  Now, personally I thought the cake itself was only okay, but the cream cheese in between the layers definitely made up for it.  I thought the ratio between cake and cheesecake were a bit extreme.  The cake would simply be perfect if there was more cake to it.  The very top layer was cream frosting.  By the time I killed half of it, i was stuffed and didn't want to continue because it was getting too sweet and too much cream cheese.  But the cake itself is overall very enjoyable.  However, if you eat just the red velvet cake parts, it doesn't taste as rich and creamy. For $ 25 w/tip, we all left feeling content.  Our waitress Lisa was definitely helpful and very sweet.  Thanks for making our friend's first Cheesecake Factory experience a great one!"
Veronica N.,"San Francisco, CA",420,165,2,1.0,7/22/2013,"I really dont see what the 5 star reviews are about. The service in this place is down the drain. I maybe see our waitress every half an hour if Im lucky. She forgot to give us straws, plates for dessert, and was no where to be found the majority of the time. I would like to say that it wasn't a very busy night and many seats were still available so Im not quite sure what she was doing. Anyways, the food here is the same quality at the same price. Not bad.  I wouldn't recommend. Not a good place for pairs or groups. You'll be infuriated by the crap service. There are so many better restaurants along this street I promise you.  Skip this place."
Michelle M.,"Palo Alto, CA",83,106,21,5.0,6/3/2015,"I went here to celebrate my 26th birthday yesterday with my friends and family, we told the waitress we had two birthdays . We were six of us. We waited for about minutes to get a table.  We were quickly helped  by a very nickel waitress, I forgot her name. We were taken to a table, and we were served freshly baked baked bread. We were asked what we want to drink, we got water and martinis. She brought us our drinks, and asked us if we knew what we wanted to eat. She recommend some vegan items for us.  She took our dinners orders,we got appetizers to share which were steamed artichoke and the tater tots both were good. To eat us our main course, we each got something different. We got 3 pastas,2 burgers and their burrito (one was a shrimp scampi, spaghetti and meatballs,chipotle pasta, a veggie burger, and a turkey burger, and their burrito). The food was delicious and the waitress was very friendly and kind, during our meal, she came back to our table and refreshed our waters and bread. At the end the staff came and sang me and my friend happy birthday and brought us two birthday sundaes. We said thank you, and she asked if we wanted to see the Cheesecake menu we declined because as yummy as it always is we were all stuffed.  She brought us or check, and we paid the bill. She was very friendly, and at the end took her time to write thanks for coming, and wrote happy birthday girls . We had a fantastic service. I will be back soon, and hopefully get her as my waitress again."
Kat C.,"Newark, CA",3,69,15,3.0,11/7/2013,"I think people who give Cheesecake a one-star rating have their expectations set way too high. I don't care how much money you are capable of spending, it's still a chain restaurant. Just like Red Robin or Elephant Bar. CHECK YOUR SILVERWARE AS YOU ARE SEATED.  The cheesecakes and desserts, while they are sure to take a few years off of your lifespan, deserve five stars themselves.  Most entrees I've tried other than the wasabi crusted tuna and the pit beef sandwich (my go-to orders that never fail to satisfy me, and thus earn themselves a five star rating as well) garner three and a half stars at best.  Don't bother checking the calorie count, just be prepared to work your tail off to get back on track. This place is carb and calorie soup. You gain a few ounces just by stepping foot in the door."
The M.,"San Francisco, CA",28,59,159,3.0,8/27/2013,"Cant really go wrong with Cheesecake Factory. I was here for a quick  to go of a Chocolate Cheesecake. The waiter got me the frozen cheesecake from their freezer and asked me to defrost it for an hour. It worked out perfect as we had an hour long drive to our friend's place. It was defrosted by the time we got home , but it wasn't as silky as it should have been .It tasted great but it missed that something special. No more frozen cheesecakes for us."
Isabelle A.,"College Park, MD",0,3,,1.0,12/10/2014,"My friend and I decided to do lunch here and we ordered a chocolate fudge cake to go, and just right after we stepped out the door, my friend found out she had ordered the wrong chocolate fudge cake that she want.  So we went in and our waiter happen to be right there, so we spoke to him and asked nicely if we can do an exchange since the price is the same. He told us it doesn't work this way, but he is still willing to do it, he was so pissed off, and said,""Can you make sure your order next time?"" He then threw the cake cover on the table angrily, and started cursing while packing the cake. It was so unproffesional! At the same time, A guy showed up, ""So you ladies want to trade your cake?""(with an elegant tone) ""Yes, we would like to..."" ""We do not usually do it, but we will do it today. We don't usually trade our cake after the cake left the store, do you know what I mean?"" He cuts me off rudely.  We understand each store has it own policy and it is alright for us if they are not able to do an exchange. We didn't even insisted or shouted at them. I don't know why we are getting this heat! My friend and I was so disappointed with their customer service. This will be our last time dining in Cheesecake factory."
Steve K.,"San Bruno, CA",2,6,2,3.0,8/16/2015,"Came in at 6:30pm Sunday night and sat in the bar area, it took 28 minutes to get our drinks and we where told there is is only one bartender tonight when there is usually two. The Bartender is new as well, it took 30 minutes to get my side salad and 45 minutes to get our food. The food was great and the manager was a nice person but she was very stressed."
