Puja L.,"Rockville, MD",45,352,73,2.0,4/24/2014,"10 people, dozens of plates, none of them good. What a disappointing way to spend a decent bit of money. Several of the plates had roasted/steamed vegetables that were still raw (and although our server offered to replace them, she never did). Cheesecake has definitely dropped in quality. I can't say we had high expectations, but is it so hard to get veggies right? Portion sizes also seemed smaller than we remember them being. Boo. Crossing Cheesecake Factory off my list of dining options for good this time."
Fred T.,"Palo Alto, CA",421,275,1685,2.0,1/16/2012,"Ah the Cheesecake factory. Ive always thought of them as a solid 3-4 star kind of place. Its kind of like going to PF Chang's: You have a general idea of what you are going to get no matter where you happen to be and they have such a huge menu that you can cover even picky eaters (more on that in a bit), and they do vary a bit from place to place but don't really stray too far from the baseline.  That being said the last two times here we have come away very unhappy with the food. As always the service is great and the atmosphere / acoustics are fantastic for a chain restaurant, but their expansive menu seems to be having a negative impact on quality and whoever is running the pass is not paying attention to the details. Todays late lunch was a case in point:  The Apps:  Buffalo Blasts: A must order IMHO. Crispy deep fried wontons filled with shredded buffalo chicken are to die for. Not today. They verged on the overcooked and at least 3 were not sealed so the filling was greasy and overcooked. That however was only the beginning.  Thai Chicken Wraps: Another must order for us. Sometimes my wife will get this as her main. The build your own platter is tasty and fun. However, today it looks like we got the lettuce discards with nice large brown slimy areas on the stems. They were replaced quickly but come on.  Mains:  Hickory Burger: Not cooked as I ordered it. There is a big difference between the rare I asked for and Medium well. Also the onion rings were absent. I mentioned the missing items and it was fixed quickly. I did not bother asking the burger to be redone. After tasting the meat, perhaps it was for the best as it had an off taste. I expect better quality meat at this range of restaurant. The top fries were pretty good but the ones in the bottom were undercooked and had that greasy translucent look to them.  Salmon: Salmon was a generous portion and properly cooked. It was off the lunch menu and was a pretty good deal.  Kids Chicken Tenders: Batter dipped and looked really good. BUT, if you are going to pre-fill the cup the ranch goes it, give it a stir so you customers don't notice the brownish skin that has developed over the little cup. Better yet lets say you fill it to order.  Heck no we did not want desert.  All and all its been back to back issues here. None of these items is a big deal but coupled together its a big issue. Also after the lettuce issue I would expect the dishes comming out to get closer scrutiny. As I said I think the menu is simply too big for any kitchen to keep tabs and quality control is a must. It kills these places long term. I for one will not be back anytime soon."
Kim N.,"South Bay, CA",2945,9796,55587,4.0,7/13/2011,"I actually do like the CF as it's something I grew up with when seeing family and friends in SoCal. There are generally only a couple of entrees Ill eat now (turkey burger/angel hair pasta+shrimp) but I still think their cheesecake is pretty good. Also, this is one of the few late night places in the area that you can get a bite or hang out past midnight on the weekends in PA"
Joyce W.,"San Diego, CA",37,30,113,4.0,1/11/2015,"The server we had was very good. Ordered the farfalle chicken, the mushroom taste was stronger than I had hopes for but it was still very good. My friend ordered the pesto pasta and it was just perfect--creamy but not too oily. Another friend ordered the Santa Fe salad and it was the perfect mixture of cilantro and salad base. Definitely will order that next time"
My S.,"Stockholm, Sweden",17,77,169,2.0,4/16/2015,"The food is good, but that's it. The service is so bad I sometimes feel like it was a joke. Also the food is good yes, however there are so many more places that is worth spending that amount of money on. Will not go back or recommend anyone going there."
Linda L.,"Sunnyvale, CA",110,110,23,3.0,8/16/2011,"Great chain, but decent service for the establishment. This place is often overfilled to capacity with celebrations and families. As a result, while the food remains decent, the service is often slow or poor. I would suggest coming here with a small group that a) doesn't mind seating at the bar area or b) making a reservation for a weekday meal.  There are far too many yummy places on or close to University Ave to justify a lengthy wait."
Andrea V.,"Stanford, CA",4,16,,1.0,7/18/2013,"If I could rate this zero stars, I would.  I made a reservation for my boyfriend's 21st birthday here. It was a Monday night. We showed up 5 minutes after the reservation and they had canceled it. Apparently, it's their policy to cancel a reservation if you are late by 10 minutes. A) we were 5 minutes late  B) considering Palo Alto parking and University Avenue congestion, how can they think this policy is a good way to treat customers who call days in advance for a reservation?? So they gave us a beeper and it took them 30 minutes to seat us. When they did seat us, the waiter was rude and dismissive. They forgot to fill our water glasses, messed up a friend's order and blamed it on her, and the waiter was completely rude when it came to paying because he already had his gratuity included in the bill.  He acted like serving us has a huge hassle. Basically, the horrible service at the Cheesecake Factory put a huge damper on my boyfriend's birthday and by the end we were racing to leave the restaurant. To top it all off, I just got a call from my bank saying I overdrafted because they charged my debit card twice.  Ridiculous. Don't come here. Take your hard-earned money elsewhere. Nola's always does an excellent job with birthdays. I will be going there from now on."
Natasha P.,"Oakland, CA",267,558,1199,4.0,10/3/2011,"Hell yes to happy hour! $5 apps and $5 pink lemonade with vodka! Love the potstickers, summer rolls, sliders and calamari. Plus, the employees are super rad - especially the head bartender. We ordered banana cream pie and I have this weird thing where I don't like old spotty bananas and he actually checked on how they looked and promptly reported back to me. That's what I call good customer service, especially when dealing with someone as bubbly and difficult as me!"
Adrian L.,"Redwood City, CA",0,24,,1.0,3/9/2014,"Dogs. I took my kids to this restaurant for a late lunch.  We arrived at 1:40 to miss the crowds.  The food did not arrive until 2:50.  Bad enough. Meanwhile, at 2:30 a couple in their twenties arrived and sat at a table with a pit bull puppy at their feet.  This was a violation of the California health code, which says that pets can only be allowed at restaurants that are outside and cannot be taken through a closed restaurant to an outside area.  Even worse, several of the waiters and waitresses--including ours--stopped to pet the animal with their bare hands, which of course they also used when delivering the food.  That, too, is against the law. This matters to us because my daughter is extremely allergic to dogs and has asthma attacks even when she walks into a room that a dog has recently been in.  For her, this is a matter of life or death, and we did not have an epipen with us.   Needless to say, we walked out when we saw our waitress playing with the dog as she brought our meal."
Bilal H.,"Hollister, CA",0,1,,1.0,1/23/2016,The food was so bad. The service was not good at all. The food was cold and the rice we ordered was as hard as a rock. The lady manager was so rude. I came with my fanily as well. We waited for two hours and that was our result.
Venkat Girish M.,"Lone Tree, CO",7,42,16,5.0,5/23/2014,"Long Island iCE Tea  is the best in this chain of restaurants,i dont know y but its simple perfect.Its goes perfectly with Avacado Egg rolls . And the Brown Bread with butter its simple yummy. Also small plates such as Chicken Samosa and Chicken mushroom Lettuce wraps are awesome. And last but not the least my All time favorite Starwberry Cheesecake melts like butter in the mouth. Service is very good and so is the Ambiance."
Jeff O.,"Fremont, CA",16,141,520,1.0,12/30/2015,Horrible service. Waited 15 min without waiter coming to ask of we want water or bread. We flagged down a waitress and she said she will bring water and bread immediately but she never show up. A waiter then show up if we want any bread and water. We ordered our lunch with drink but someone else brought out drinks and ask if we will like some bread. What The Fuck! This place is so dumb I have to spell out WTF so the manager will know exactly what I am saying.
Lan S.,"Norman, OK",0,5,38,3.0,7/17/2014,*:.｡. o()o .｡.:* such a big cheese cake! I love chocolate haaaaaaha~ nice cream flower.
Ariel S.,"Mountain View, CA",3,33,,4.0,6/25/2015,"So many choices here their menu is literally a book!  I think they have something for everybody.  Last time I went I got their Cobb salad and it was huge!  I had to save half of it to eat as my lunch for the next day, but I didn't mind.  I love having leftovers!  I always get something new here and am rarely disappointed.  There are a few things on the menu I'm not really fond of, but just eat the ones you really enjoy. There is nothing wrong with experimenting with a menu like theirs."
Vasia G.,"Menlo Park, CA",6,5,,3.0,7/16/2015,Food was great...Kobe burger was delicious. Our waiter was a bit too much. In the end he kind of assumed that all our change was his tip and asked as if we want all our money back. Felt a  bit uncomfortable.
Angel B.,"Palo Alto, CA",2,23,32,5.0,6/3/2014,Shan't asleep was so nice even thoiugh we only shared spinach dip all the staff are great wish I had more room dip is fantastic
Benny B.,"Central San Jose, CA",55,60,37,5.0,10/10/2014,"I've came to this location a handful of times and had bad experiences , pore service , but tonight was different , our waiter was on his A game , polite had character , checked on us over and over , his name was Mario ,"
Tiffany M.,"Sacramento, CA",319,482,537,4.0,2/16/2012,"Came here a couple times before and never had a bad experience. We came her last night the night after Valentines day, and there was absolutely no wait! Made reservations at 7:30, and arrived 10 minutes late - and they sat us promptly! Yey!! The thing I love about Cheesecake Factory is their menu has such a great selection of things - you can't go wrong. We left taking a White Chocolate Caramel Macadamia Nut Cheesecake home. I cannot wait to indulge myself in it tonight after work!! Alcohol,  not much of a great selection. JW Pink Lemonade - Taste like candy and lemonade. Alcohol? Just order wine if you must. Cocktails are weak, and not worth $10. Definitely coming here alot more, especially on a weekday evening. (No wait!)"
VB L.,"San Mateo, CA",971,720,826,4.0,3/27/2011,"Every time we come here I marvel at the extensive menu and wonder how the chefs can keep up with all the different recipes.  Then I get lost in the magical world of the drink menu and wonder how the bartenders can keep up with all the different drinks.  Then I stop the wondering and marveling and dig into what really matters - the ordering! First up was the Provenance Merlot and the Firecracker Salmon Rolls.  The Merlot was tasty, but steeply priced at $11/glass.  Personally, there were better wines on the menu for less.  The Firecrackers Salmon Rolls were delicious (as always) and they were gobbled up quickly. Main meal consisted of Thai Lettuce Wraps - big chunks of chicken smothered in peanuts, sprouts, some funky noodles, marinated cucumbers and three lovely sauces for dipping!  Amazing!! Cody, our server, was clearly overwhelmed, but handled the masses with grace and a smile.   Love coming to this Cheesecake Factory and can't wait to go back again. TIP:  Street parking is a challenge, but there's a public lot just around the corner on Webster."
Veggie T.,"Menlo Park, CA",0,5,,1.0,8/19/2013,"If you're a vegetarian or vegan; never step in this restaurant. They have only 3 vegetarian choices for dinner. I asked for  'garlic noodles' and what I had was a plate full of pasta with very few veggies in it. I asked the server if he took the order correctly because I didn't ask for a pasta but asked for a noodle, and he told me he doesn't know the difference! He were kind to go and ask the people he works with and came back to me saying 'We don't have the thing you ask for, and in fact we never did."" Then why include it in the menu?!"
