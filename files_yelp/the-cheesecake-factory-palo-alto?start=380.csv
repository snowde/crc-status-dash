Siddharth S.,"Sunnyvale, CA",10,14,2,3.0,4/26/2015,Their cheap plastic mugs in which they serve water is such a put off. Food is pretty good though.
Brad G.,"West Lafayette, IN",5,6,1,2.0,6/22/2015,"Ran out of ribeye steak so I substituted for a filet, the filet was cut oddly (thinly) and was over cooked and dry. Others ordered filet and it was truly a filet but was not cooked according to how it was ordered. Overall not a good dining experience. Would not recommend this restaurant."
Gloria M.,"San Jose, CA",300,192,538,5.0,3/8/2015,Always consistently good!!!!!!!! For some reason I appreciate cheese cake more now that I use to... In Denver we have a ton of American foods in the area and so we never go to cheesecake... But living here I Silicon Valley there are so much alternative authentic restaurants that getting Cheesecake Factory food was bomb. The restaurant was huge! It's always has nice decor and the good seating! We waited for 15 minutes prior to getting dinner and the wait staff is very helpful! You usually get a free order of bread to start  with! And my favorite is the brown rye bread.. It's very soft and has a sweet taste to it. My fiancé got the chicken Parmesan which was perfectly crusted and very tasty! I got the chicken Bellagio! Which was great!!!!!!! Even though they are a chain restaurant! They really do a good job with cooking their food! We even got the smores cheesecake for dessert which was heaven!!!!!! I mean you can't go wrong by getting dessert here! On the plus side their servings are enormous!!! There's always more food than one person can eat so you an share or have enough to take home to eat for another time!!!! I will seriously go back again and again to get my cheese cake fixing!!!
Sue K.,"Hayward, CA",0,8,4,1.0,2/27/2013,"Terrible service: Gloria V., the waitress keep forgetting to get us bread and she was too lazy to get us a soup spoon.  She said she couldn't find a soup spoon so she got us a teaspoon from an unoccupied table instead.  Really?  No soup spoon in a big fancy restaurant?!! Then she went on gossiping with another waitress right next to our table about 10 inches away. Terrible manager:  I got a water mug with a ring of pink mold that I discovered after taking a few sips.  I pointed it out to the manager and he said he will look into it and try to offer us free dessert!  WHAT?!  Seriously?  I declined.  We don't want free cake!  Make sure you don't cause health hazards to your customers!  And he disappeared afterwards.  No follow up!  No star!  Not coming back to this Cheesecake Factory.  I've had better service at Hillsdale and Stevenscreek.  Didn't catch his name because I was mad but it's a balding Asian guy.  This happened 2/27/2013 at 1:20pm."
Rob C.,"Palo Alto, CA",1616,4663,178,3.0,8/7/2014,"still popular after all these years.  skinnylicious menu with smaller portions for the calorie conscious.  wasn't like that back in the day more than 10 years ago.  most people probably have a special place for the calorie bombs here.  around since 1978, certainly has been a very successful chain, one that I enjoyed over 15 years ago. dulce de leche cheesecake slice, always has those crispy nuts on whipped cream. still famous for their portion size."
Karne N.,"Palo Alto, CA",12,283,161,4.0,2/1/2014,"We have been here countless times, but because I had a lunch and a happy hour here this week, I decided to finally write a review.  While the service is sometimes terribly slow, it was not bad this time in either case.  We seem to always have helpful, conscientious waiters at happy hour, and they do a really nice job with it.  The food is tasty, so are the drinks, and the prices are great.  Friday night it was very busy - other nights, not so much.  At lunch or dinner, I tend to go with their southwestern salad because I love the cilantro dressing, but this time I tried their lunch sized barbecued chicken pizza.  Excellent!  All in all, I think the key is to go here when you are not pressed for time."
Dan B.,"Redwood City, CA",613,1173,900,3.0,1/6/2011,"You realize you're paying extra for the decor...Right? I came to the Cheesecake factory as part of a group holiday lunch.  The ambiance is admittedly pretty stunning (Art Deco -meets- Aladdin -meets- Vegas), and it felt like a good pick to go for a festive meal with coworkers.  I also appreciated the wide variety of dishes offered on the menu.  But that's pretty much where it ended. I found the food to be below average and prices to be a bit high. After scanning the menu, I still felt like something basic, so I ordered the Kobe beef burger with sweet potato fries.  It did not meet my expectations: -- The beef was cooked well-done, though I had requested medium-rare -- Beef quality didn't seem like Kobe (or even an American version of Kobe) -- Cost of $13 is higher than most places in the bay area (price not incl. extra $ for sweet potato fries). At the end of our meal I polled my co-workers around the table; Nobody was ecstatic; In fact, everyone used the words ""OK"" or ""fine."" When the waiter asked if they wanted to take leftovers home, most declined. Your honor...I rest my case. Some people in the group opted for dessert but I went straight for the coffee (Disclaimer: I don't like cheesecake) In short, this is a fine choice if: - You're not that much of a ""foodie"", or - You're dining with kids, or - Decor and cheesecake are a big deal to you For me, 2 stars for the food, one more for the decor."
Vicky L.,"Palo Alto, CA",812,1621,112,4.0,3/31/2011,"Okay.. I'm backtracking a bit on my previous review. We've stopped by on occasion when its late and we don't feel like Pizza My Heart. The portions are still unbelievably huge and the calories are astronomical but at least they post it so I know what I'm eating.  Service here truly is hit or miss, it usually is a miss when they're swamped but when we've gone when they're closing the servers are great. Actually major kudos to the server we got last time since I'm sure he was getting off soon and we end up sitting at 10:40... yet he had a huge amount of patience and smiles when serving us. These stars are for the service i got from the bakery side of the restaurant. I called ahead of time to reserve a Mango Cheesecake for my friend's birthday. Daniel helped me and was super helpful in describing the various cheesecakes and the components of this fancy schmancy cheesecake. When I got there, it was all wrapped up and ready to go, a quick convo with him and the manager Anthony and I was on my way out the door with a great cake for my co-worker's party. They were helpful and attentive; complete opposite of the crazy servers I get when I eat at noon on a weekend. Major kudos to Anthony and Daniel, they get 5 stars for paying attention to customer service!"
Jessie L.,"San Francisco, CA",231,758,1096,4.0,2/20/2012,"Kinda pricey but they have a wide selection on their menu. Some stuff is just average or good but not particularly special. Their tempura roll (appetizer) is REALLY good though. And of course, their cheesecake is amazing (I had their red velvet). Definitely expensive though (~$8/slice)."
tlktodahand t.,"Belmont, CA",1,34,10,1.0,12/1/2015,"Took too long.  Almost an hour had past, and the food I ordered was not served, I had to closet bill and leave.  The only saving grace was that the manager didn't allow me to pay for the bad service..."
Hurnan V.,"Riverside, CA",518,253,215,4.0,3/12/2014,"This chain is one of my favorite go-to places when I am a) super hungry or b) going with a larger group of friends -- their portions are SO gigantic! Located in downtown Palo Alto, this Cheesecake Factory is surprisingly spacious inside, unlike the other restaurants in the area. The last time I was here, I was ravenous (per usual), and ordered a full size The Everything pizza and the Luau salad for my sister and me to share. The Luau salad was like a mountain and very fresh, lots of variety; my only issue with it is that they definitely piled on too much dressing. The bottom of the plate was practically a mini pool. Then, the waiter confused our order and thought we had ordered a half pizza; they quickly put in another order of a half (which they ended up burning). So, after that whole debacle, my sister and I received only the half, but that was enough for two, and we even took the left overs to go. Bottom line: expect gigantic portions of food, drenched with oil/grease/dressing -- but space yourself for the cheesecake! This is overall a great place for a nice sit down meal to really fill up your stomach. By the way: plenty of free 2hr parking nearby, or a short walk from the Palo Alto train station."
Ruth C.,"Mountain View, CA",475,480,245,3.0,1/22/2009,"I've been here a few times and definitely agree that service can be hit or miss.  I think it all depends on the waiter you get which says a lot.  Whether it is busy or incredibly empty, a good waiter will show his true self. One thing on the menu that I've gotten repeatedly is the Crispy Chicken Costoletta.  It's always quite delicious and filling.  Lots of leftovers.  Could easily be shared with 3 people. I also have enjoyed the mango daiquiri.  Tastes just like a fruit smoothie! Now... what's with the names of some of the dishes?? Rapunzel fun burger (inside joke).. I believe the actual name is called the ""Tons of Fun"" burger... which my friend informed me was very much like a Big Mac (look and taste).  The fries that accompany it are pretty good, but a little salty. Another fun name to a dish - Bang-Bang Chicken and Shrimp.  Fun to say and probably fun to eat and recall later! One thing that Cheesecake Factory doesn't do well is spicy so don't come looking for it here. As for the cheesecakes?  My favorite is the raspberry lemon.  I can finish a slice with no problem.  It's light and the tartness of the raspberry does a really good job cutting the creaminess of the cheesecake. If you've never been to Cheesecake, I would highly recommend you do at least once.  It is an experience in itself to browse the huge book of a menu and get giddy over the cheesecake selection.  As a bonus, if it's your birthday, you can get a free slice of cheesecake and of course singing."
Frank Y.,"Alpharetta, GA",69,51,6,1.0,10/26/2014,Service disappoints again. Two out of three meals delivered at the same time. Last meal for party of three arrives as first two meals completed. Not even a sign of regret. A shame as the menu is diverse enough to have something for everyone.
Paola O.,"Fremont, CA",13,35,24,3.0,5/5/2012,"I do love this restaurant, it is one of my favorites but the services is a big problem.  The menu is incredible, OF COURSE, they have a menu for vegetarians, which is why I love this restaurant. You can find a lot of options not just salads. :):) And the most important thing is that you'll find detailed nutrition information of some dishes, isn't awesome?? About their services quality, they are friendly most of the time, but u feel like they want to kick u out, every 10 mins they come and ask if everything is ok. and if u r about to finish the meal, they ask if u want a dessert or  u r ready for the check. I don't feel relaxed, I just hate to be interrupted many times. Overall, this is not a cheap restaurant, U cant make a reservation, and be ready to wait like 30 mins for a table :)"
Ofa P.,"East Palo Alto, CA",1,7,,4.0,6/1/2015,"I go to this Cheesecake Factory often.  I'm a LOVER of their Chicken Madeira.  I've only been disappointed once with my usual CM order, because the mashed potato was cold on the inside.  However, I've never been disappointed with any other meals I have ordered in the past.  Service has always been great for me, waiting time not a problem at all.  I've ate at the bar twice- great service as well!   I would have given this review a 5 star, but did not because of the few times I have gone here and the clean up crew didn't do a good job.  Leaving prior customer's food droppings underneath the table/crumbs on tables, without sweeping up/wiping down tables properly clean before I was seated. Overall I always enjoy my dining here :)"
Henry O.,"Union City, CA",0,5,,1.0,10/24/2013,"NO CHANGING TABLE in Women's bathroom!!! I always loves this place before we had children. However, whoever is managing this place doesn't understand the value of having a baby changing table in the women's bathroom. NOT a family friendly restaurant. Every restaurant in downtown PA has changing table expect this one. Don't bring children here, NOT Family friendly."
Jennifer D.,"San Jose, CA",22,18,,4.0,3/24/2015,"I've had better service at other Cheesecake Factory restaurants. Nothing really makes this one stand out from the rest, but a huge shoutout to Gregory who was working take out tonight. Such a nice guy and a great worker! Keep it up, dude. :)"
Kat A.,"San Mateo, CA",0,1,,1.0,12/5/2014,"Head's up to anyone who is pregnant -- I was informed by the very rude receptionist that all of their salads are prepared on a cutting board that touches unpasteurized cheese regularly (even though per USDA reg unpasteurized cheese products cannot be served unless expressly declared on the menu and cannot be cross contaminated with other food).  Not sure if she had no idea what she was talking about, since I find it highly unlikely a chain restaurant like the Cheesecake Factory would follow such practices, but enough to make me take my business elsewhere."
Chris M.,"Pollock Pines, CA",1,42,9,3.0,4/25/2014,"Good food for a restaurant chain(i am not a big fan of chain food)  Food: We had the calamari appetizer. For the main course i ordered Chicken Madeira, pretty good. Not sure if the portions or presentation were worth the price, but it was very tasty.  My partner had the  jambalaya, that dish was strange in the fact that they served it with half pound of noodles, so it was mostly carbs... Service: The server was nice and attentive. She appeared to be relatively new. Made a small mistake on the check, in which it was $55 under what should have been billed."
Johnny F.,"Union City, CA",15,19,,2.0,8/14/2014,The food was ok..until they decided to kill the lights.  I could hardly see what I was eating.  The place in my opinion is overpriced.  It was ok..nothing special.
