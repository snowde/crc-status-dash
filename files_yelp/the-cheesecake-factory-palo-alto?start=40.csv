Kat K.,"Mountain View, CA",12,87,91,4.0,9/10/2017,"Consistently awesome food. I love their chicken Bellagio, buffalo bites for appetizer, and cajun jambalaya pasta. Came here for a first date with my boyfriend too  and he was impressed at how much I could eat. Hahaha! We have come late at night as well for just dessert - cheesecake of course and a root beer float. Sometimes I get gift cards for here from my credit card rewards program and get a free meal! Score!"
Laura S.,"Oceanside, CA",7,4,,1.0,11/10/2017,This Cheesecake Factory has the WORST service of any restaurant I've ever been to!!Both time we've been there there staff was not helpful and service was extremely slow!
Jerome C.,"South San Francisco, CA",104,16,20,1.0,8/25/2017,I don't think this is really a cheesecake factory...every cheesecake factory I've been to warm bread is delivered to the table..received cold bread at this location.  Sat down here at 1045pm with just a couple customers in the restaurant. Still had to wait an eternity for our food!!  Not sure why we had to wait so long considering when the food arrived it wasn't even hot..... This place ruins the cheesecake factory name
Chan T.,"Santa Clara, CA",19,231,107,3.0,2/21/2017,"Came here during the weekend cuz we wanted to take our son on cal train. Decided to eat in down town Palo Alto. Had no clue that Palo Alto had a Cheese Cake Factory. Saw it wasn't packed how the usual cheese cake factories are like at the malls and plus we had a gift card. We were seated right away near the bar area.  A lot of the workers here didn't seem too happy. Our waiter was very mono tone.  Service was good, food was okay. I would def. come here again if it's not busy like all the other cheese cakes.  I did notice that this place doesn't have them wearing white pants. That's new right? Cuz before the servers used to have to wear all white."
Tarcisio G.,"Eastside, Las Vegas, NV",16,40,12,4.0,9/21/2017,The Cheesecake Factory has been one of my favorite places to treat myself to a good meal. They have good servers and good service. This last visit was a bit different because our server was new and made an error with our bill but other then that my party and I had a great time.
CB Y.,"San Jose, CA",2,45,154,1.0,9/8/2017,"Ok I should have known this location is the worst. I ordered Fish and chips  Fish was fine. But colesalw was warm.  Like well brewed coffee. Ugh.. It was so disgusting. It's not safe when coleslaw is warm. I wanted to ask new one.  But my server that black girl were never around my table.  And then when she shows up she checked on us for 1 second and leave.. Wow..  When I finally asked her this coleslaw is disgusting. She just said ""so do you want the fresh one?"" ""I mean.."" "" do you want to fresh one?"" She never apologized or anything just keep saying the same stuff like stupid bird.  I don't know I always had a good time on cheese cake factory but she just ruined it really hard.  I don't think I will ever comeback here again.  So disappointed at bad management.  They really just need to use this place as a museum of the Worst cheese Cake factory in the history.  +she left our check without any noise.  I thought we were buying a drug.  No sound  hand the money. and leave... Sigh.."
Amy C.,"San Mateo, CA",299,409,1300,4.0,7/30/2016,"Even though The Cheesecake Factory is a huge chain, I always get excited about their desserts. Since today was National Cheesecake Day, I knew I had to go (they always do a half-off every cheesecake slice on these days, and this year they were offering the promotion for two days in a row). Also, they have a new cheesecake that features my absolute favorite dessert flavor - hazelnut. We arrived around 5pm on a Saturday and the place was already packed with a 20 minute wait. I like how they give you an electronic thing to hold, so you can go outside, wander around other stores, and then come back when it starts buzzing. Once we were seated, service was quite fast and attentive. My boyfriend ordered the Factory Burger ($11.99), which came with cheddar cheese, tomato, grilled onions on sourdough bread or wheat loaf, with either french fries or green salad. The burger was cooked well and was juicy. It was an interesting choice to put it on sourdough bread since it looked almost like sandwich halves than a burger, but I appreciated the extra hardness and crunchiness of the sourdough. The green salad was nicely dressed but not sodden in oil. We also ordered a slice of their new cheesecake: chocolate hazelnut cheesecake topped with hazelnut crunch and Nutella ($7.95 normally, but half-price today from the promotion). It came with a generous amount of whipped cream on the side and Nutella drizzled on top. The cheesecake was heaven. It was very sweet and definitely a calorie bomb, but it was dessert heaven. The hazelnut flavor in the cake was strong, and combined with the Nutella on top, was almost too sweet, but I still loved it. I also like the added crushed hazelnuts in the middle layer for additional crunch. I also ordered an appetizer of buffalo wings ($11.99). These were pricy for the amount of food, but the appetizer itself was quite good. The buffalo wings were spicy and crunchy on the outside and tender and juicy on the inside. I didn't quite care for the dipping sauce, which was a blue cheese dressing. I would have preferred a creamier dressing like ranch. Service was very friendly. They did forget to bring us bread which was disappointing, but overall they were very attentive."
Angel B.,"Palo Alto, CA",1,11,22,4.0,11/19/2017,Salad and service was fantastic but this a brownie slightly larger than my thumb 11-19-17 waitress stayed nice even though my friends and I were very picky
James L.,"Goldsmith, Denver, CO",49,3,9,2.0,11/25/2017,"Pretty place, nice atmosphere, courteous staff, but my waitress messed up my order. It was easy. Classic burger, well done, bacon, a gluten free bun and a salad instead of fries. First I got a classic burger on a gluten bun with fries. Then I had to send it back a second time because it was rare. My son was done with the appetizer and his meal before I started eating."
James H.,"Euless, TX",0,18,,1.0,12/16/2017,Called to place and order and they put me on hold for 5 minutes I called back and they put me on hold again for another 5 minutes. I call back a third time and ask why I'm on hold forever and the guy says that they have nobody there to take my order. Then why the hell do you idiots keep putting me on hold? Just tell me that all your workers are in the back playing with each other. It was 3pm so it wasnt even busy. Worst cheesecake factory ever.
Rafaela S.,"San Francisco, CA",41,60,105,4.0,3/31/2017,"Came here for appetizers, drinks, and dessert. We have been to this location a couple of times before to pick up dessert to go, but it was our first time seating down. It was a Friday night - so there was about a 15 minute wait. We just sat at a high top table by the bar to avoid the wait list.  A server helped us right away, got our drinks, and some bread to munch on. Thank goodness she did because our apps took about 25 minutes to come out. She did acknowledge and apologize for the wait and as we were not in a hurry, we didn't make a big deal of it. Apps - fried mac and cheese and crab wontons. They were typical appetizers, prepared well, and were served with plenty of dipping sauce. Cheesecake - we tried the chocolate hazelnut crunch! I just found out this is a rather new option on the menu. It was delicious - it may be taking the spot for my top choice (replacing the red velvet)! The creamy Nutella with the crunchy crust is a perfect combination. The Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite chains, but there are so many one of a kind restaurants in the  downtown area that it almost feels like a crime to go eat at a chain - I definitely recommend visiting the unique spots in the area if you're just visiting."
Sargon J.,"Menlo Park, CA",0,12,32,1.0,12/6/2016,"This review is based upon order-to-go service. (Food & bread is still great. Service is lousy.) Called-in for an order to go on a Tuesday night ~8:45PM. Was put on hold for a little over 5 minutes -- maybe they forgot about me? So I hung up and called again. The receptionist apologized said she'd get on it right away. Waited on hold for another 7 minutes, with still with no answer. I probably should've stayed on the line to see how long it would take for them to pick up the phone. But honestly, I was not looking to wait an additionally 30 minutes for the food to come out of the kitchen."
Suvodeep P.,"Mountain View, CA",10,11,1,1.0,6/24/2017,"I came here with my parents on a Friday night. The food was great! We order 3 drinks, a cheesecake and a couple of dishes. Now for the sad part. Our server. We hardly ever got to see her. We had to look around for her and wait several minutes. She never came to us and asked if we needed anything. The first round of drinks took 20 min. When we asked her she gave some random excuse and then on I would say the food was coming to us on time.  Then something weird happened. One of the waiters there came to ask if we needed some more bread. I mentioned that could you get some of the brown ones. My server came back 5 min later saying that they run out of brown bread. While they were serving brown bread to other tables around us. This was weird.  I didn't say anything. Offered a 30+% tip and said cheer up! She had a frowned up face the entire time. However, I was deeply disappointed with the experience. I have been to cheesecake factory multiple times and I really liked the place. That is the reason why I thought of getting my family here. Now I think it was a bad decision."
Tobi S.,"Palo Alto, CA",18,10,18,4.0,10/8/2017,"The cheesecake factory is the best ever! Apart for their signature cheesecakes, you can expect to find great food here! If you're ever in the area be sure to check out their variety of other dishes like their Caesar salad or the Louisiana chicken pasta. They are delicious! The only crappy thing about this place, is that it tends to get busy fast, lines take forever and there is one particular server who seems very distant and honestly, lost for lack of better words. I don't know if they're new, but they sometimes look like they don't know what they're doing. Try out the Cheesecake Factory but don't go in with extremely high expectations."
Sarah W.,"Oakland, Pittsburgh, PA",65,2,,1.0,6/25/2017,"We were told there would be a 10 minute wait but had to wait closer to 30 to be seated. Service was so slow that the whole meal from start to finish took about 2.5 hours, including a 30 minute wait to see dessert menus that never came - we finally went to find our waiter to get the check.  Food was not nearly as good as other Cheesecake Factory locations.  But by far the worst part of the service was that when the food came out, the server held an extremely hot plate at my boyfriend's face level, which he grabbed with no warning about how hot the plate was from the server. He stated that he had burnt his hand, and the server just walked away without a word about it. Hours later his hand is still red, that plate was very hot! The cherry on top was that we split the bill between three cards, with the total for each card written on the receipt. The waiter messed that up too and misallocated the amounts. All in all a very disappointing Cheesecake Factory experience, we won't be coming back to this location."
Michelle M.,"Hayward, CA",0,19,5,1.0,6/19/2017,"We came with a party of 10 so we had to wait a few minutes to be seated. No problem.  Once seated we waited close to 20 minutes before someone came to ask for our drink order and by then we were ready to order our lunch as well.  Most people got their food in about 30 min, but 2 of us got our food in 40. It was frustrating because I only ordered a salad! Mine was the last to come out. The floor manager had to come tell me that my chicken was overcooked and they had to cook it again.  She offered me a soup but what she really should have done was comp my meal since others were almost finished before I got mine. I ended up getting a to go box because I didn't want others to feel rushed. Too bad there was bad service today. I was really hoping for a fun and enjoyable meal."
Finla P.,"Redmond, WA",19,118,66,1.0,6/30/2017,"After waiting for nearly 40 minutes for our salads to arrive, the husband finally asked the server how much longer should we wait for our order to arrive. It was another 5 minutes.  I am a loyal Cheesecake patron and I have never had a chance to complain until now. This restaurant at Palo Alto, is by far the worst cheesecake I have been to. Maybe they were running short of staff but reasons not withstanding, I am never returning to this location again."
Alexandra C.,"Campbell, CA",177,49,4,1.0,12/8/2017,"oh dear god. where to start. 1A) **ITALIANS: DO NOT EAT HERE... YOU WILL REGRET THIS MEAL A THOUSAND TIMES OVER** 1) Doordash might be to blame for the completely cold meal I just ate, but TCF is to blame for the rest of the problems. 2) I ordered the fettucine alfredo which came cold, in a literal pool of oil or butter, the noodles were probably tossed in the fat to keep from sticking, but they used way too much, and it was gross. 3) the ""alfredo"" (white, bland, unsalted, no garlic, no parmesan, cream) is probably from a can, unseasoned, and totally soulless. no flavor whatsoever. the garlic bread had more seasoning and garlic than the alfredo. Also: I ordered extra sauce... I received two 2-ounce cups with sauce. this.. was not enough to even cover the noodles at all, glad I ordered extra... or, am I? that shit was disgusting. 4) WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS TIRAMISU? IS IT A CHEESECAKE? this is the worst tiramisu I have ever had. greasy, flavorless. no heart. no soul. shaped like a piece of brown cheesecake, with whipped cream on the side, and a very .. unflavored cake bottom that is not a lady finger base at all.. no espresso (the color in the weird center is brown, maybe that's it...) no amaretto, no marsala flavor,.. nothing. gross. fucking gross. PS: TCF Cooks: if you need help learning how to make real food, I can teach you how to make a freakin' alfredo and a killer tiramisu.  Signed, Bummed Chef who happens to be of Sicilan descent."
Hans C.,"San Mateo, CA",5,32,,2.0,6/25/2017,"Very very very slow service. First thing to come was a small salad, about 25 mins after ordering. Rest of the food came 10 mins later for 5 of us.  Food was ok, not as good as usual other Cheesecake Factory"
Melissa B.,"Newark, CA",128,3,,1.0,6/18/2017,"We order food through Door Dash quite often and the last few times, the food is not consistent, the bread is always missing (or the dasher has to wait 30 minutes for the bread while our food gets cold). Tonight after we waited an extra half hour for the bread, we got our food and the pasta was bland and the $16 salad had no dressing with it! I honestly used to love getting food from this place, but the inconsistency has changed my mind. We will no longer be giving our business to this location.  P.s. I called to speak to someone about this an hour ago, and I was placed on hold for 15 minutes until I finally hung up. This is terrible customer service."
