J G.,"Palo Alto, CA",49,235,197,1.0,7/27/2011,"I don't know why it's on longer visible on Yelp. It's the worst lunch ever! Terrible service! We had one server come greeting us and took the order for drinks. 5 minutes later, another server came over and asked what we would like to order for drinks?! Huh? Then nobody came for a while.  It takes forever to get our food ready and given we've been asked by two different servers.  One of my friends' pasta was just too salty! So it took another 30 minutes to get the new order and her food didn't come until we finished everything. No discount for that and no manager came over to check on us.  Since we're running late, we got our cheesecakes to go. Apparently, all the to-go cheesecakes are half-size as regular size and same price! We sure will never come back again!"
Mary T.,"Palo Alto, CA",1,20,15,1.0,8/16/2014,Worst cappuccino ever! The cheesecakes are definitely overrated and service was bad as well-had to wait about 10min for utensils after the meal was served.My first and last time there!
Mel S.,"San Jose, CA",7,16,3,2.0,5/28/2015,"I never like this place but end up here sometimes because of trendy friends.  Their desserts are good, but the service is kind of poor and as I mentioned in my other review I would rather go across the street to Pluto's which is cheaper and does not have the Vegas Decor Feel."
Al A.,"Palo Alto, CA",4,20,5,4.0,4/1/2015,"We like coming to happy hour. We get pot stickers, guacamole and cheese bread. I would get the cheese sticks but they don't have cold marinara sauce."
Kimberly C.,"Austin, TX",93,342,86,4.0,12/19/2011,"Oh Cheesecake Factory, thank you for such variety on your menus.  Plus, your skinny menu is awesome.  A page full of healthier choices make it a lot easier to eat well while I still opted for something on the regular breakfast section of the menu.   Brioche breakfast sandwich- what else can I ask for on a Sunday brunch?  And even better, that page of eggs/omelettes and my sandwich is served til 5pm.  My sandwich came with either a side of tomatoes, fries, or hash browns.  Fries perfectly crisp..if Burger King and Wendys fries were to have babies, they'd taste like these.  Sandwich was fairly large, filled with scrambled eggs, cheese, thin slice of ham, bacon, and tomatoes and lightly sprinkled with pepper..I ate half and was satisfied.  Not tasting too heavy at all.  So yummy.  Mayo on it makes it even better. Mmm can't live without some of that MayO!   Service was actually prompt and in the beginning, she told us she had to take the order of another table first and she'd be right back.  it was considerate of her."
Sharon P.,"Palo Alto, CA",0,17,,1.0,11/8/2014,Eat here?  Nope. You can hear their Mandatory Music amplified on cheap speakers on the other side of University Avenue.  How could one hope to have a conversation with all that noise?!
Jamie C.,"Perth, Australia",333,250,8436,1.0,11/19/2010,"Oh boy....this review is going to have ""BAD"" written all over it. I've been here countless times, with no issues and I must say today's was the worst experience we've had there.  There were 4 of us and the bad incident happened to my ""lil sis"". So she had her tooth extracted a week ago and has been on a liquid diet since and slowly getting back to eating solids and was excited to try something different off the menu. She ordered the Lemon Herb Roast Chicken and when it was served to her, one of the pieces had blood on it. The waiter took the dish away and said they would fix it but when it came back out again the second time, you could see that the chicken was pretty much burnt on the outside. She cut into one of the pieces and as she got closer to the inside, more chicken blood appeared!!! Poor girl was so traumatized!! The waiter took it away and she decided to order the Jambalaya instead.  The rest of us, by that time, had already finished our meals when her Jambalaya Pasta came out so she had them pack it to go since we were already late getting back to work. My two other friends ordered Pork Chops and they were extremely overcooked and dry. One of them had trouble even cutting into the meat without the plate moving all over the table. My dish was the Eggplant Sandwich and there were gigantic slices of red onion that were barely grilled and the taste was so strong. I love onions but that was a little OTT. When the check finally arrived, they didn't even comp lil sis' pasta!! It wasn't until the manager came to our table to ask how everything was and she told him she hasn't eaten yet that he offered to take it off the bill. Shouldn't that have already been done before the waiter gave the check to us?!?!? See, it's the little things like that which makes a huge difference. And for the record, lil sis ate the pasta when we got back to work and the noodles were soggy and it smelled bad so she threw it away."
Duke Of Frisco X.,"San Francisco, CA",380,174,4102,1.0,12/9/2012,Zero stars... I don't ever eat here but I had a gift card given to me. I ordered the bang bang chicken & shrimp it smelled and looked good until I started eating and noticed that some of the shrimp still had their end trails full of feces!!! I told my waiter he said quick sorry and didn't offer any solution to my problem!!! Ive couldn't of eaten anyways my appetite was ruined!!! I also contacted corporate and wrote a lengthy comment for which I've haven't heard from no one even till this day!!!
Jessica R.,"San Francisco, CA",3,38,7,1.0,9/26/2015,"Food is decent but service sucks. The Cheesecake factory used to be one of my favorite restaurants but the last few times I've visited, they really let me down. Our waiter was a middle-aged Hispanic male who was very condesending. He ignored us pretty much the whole time we were there and at the end he charged my friends card 3 times for different amounts. He then said that we told him to charge it like that. No clue why anyone would ask to be charged 3 separate times in different amounts but ok. After he fixed it he came back with like 12 receipts and said the transactions would be adjusted right away. C'mon dude, we weren't born in the stone age.. we know how this works. It's gonna take a few days. Not a problem. Before he walked away he made sure to tell us that gratuity was NOT included and we MUST leave at least 15%, the percentages are on the bottom of the bill. Again, OK dude this isn't the first time we eat at a restaurant. Idiot! I regret leaving him a tip at all. Won't be returning."
Ori S.,"Palo Alto, CA",67,13,1,2.0,10/16/2013,"My family and I tended to come here to eat lunch/dinner. However the last 2 times I came with guests from overseas I received the worst lunch experience in the Bay Area.  Both times my guests and I waited for over 30 minutes just so for the food to be served. Neither time the food, nor services were great. This time it was beyond bad.  My meal, Chicken Salad, was very very dry. The chicken was tasteless, and there was no dressing flavor to salad. It seemed like the entire salad was composed of mostly lettuce, and two chicken strips.  My guest ordered Pear & Blue Cheese with Flat Bread. The bread looked like it was not cooked, and I'm not sure how satisfied of the food he was.  I used to think that The Cheesecake Factory was a safe place to take guests in terms of quality, but now I know better and will probably not come here again.  The reason for the 2 stars is only because of the memories my family and I had enjoyed at the Cheesecake Factory over the years."
Audrey H.,"Redwood City, CA",1,23,5,2.0,10/10/2012,"I have been to various locations of the Cheesecake Factory and this one has been without fail the worst. On each occasion we've had mediocre service (i.e. insincere overly cheesy waitresses and slow(never coming to the table) service).  The food at this location also always seems to be lacking whether it be that they are missing ingredients in the restaurant, or missing actual components that are supposed to be a part of your meal, or they serve stale food (bread and chips). I have asked myself how many times will it take me to finally say ""OK, I am never coming back here"" and I think I have finally decided, never again."
Lissette O.,"Civic Center, San Francisco, CA",1,7,1,5.0,3/7/2015,Great service good with kids no reservations needed chicken chipotle pasta my favorite
Jen H.,"San Diego, CA",334,1885,187,3.0,11/2/2011,"We came here to eat lunch with a student around the area. Parking was not too bad if you look for spots off University Ave. Hmm, the shroom burger and Hershey cheesecake were both pretty good. We came here around 12:30pm, and I guess it was peak time, and the service was pretty slow.  Your typical Cheesecake Factory--not the best experience, nor the worst experience."
Bryan D.,"Campbell, CA",136,21,12,3.0,5/5/2014,"Well, the Kobe burger wasn't good at all :( the buns were burned and the burger itself was burned in the outside as well. The only reason I give it three stars is because my son likes the pastas!"
Heffer C.,"Menlo Park, CA",6,52,,3.0,4/29/2014,"Good food, served in nice portions. Lots of options, so everyone is sure to find something they like. The cheesecakes and other desserts are yummy. BUT none of the food or desserts are healthy, so bear that in mind. The service is hit or miss, and tends to be slow. And it is loud, loud, loud in this place, so don't come here with anyone who you want to have a real conversation with. The parking is a nightmare, as in there is none. So you get to circle around downtown PA to find something. You would think that a large restaurant like this would have a parking lot..."
Megan M.,"San Francisco, CA",10,51,9,2.0,2/9/2015,"The cheesecake here is always amazing. The food however here is so so. Had to send my order back 4 times. First time it was wrong, second time they gave me rotten lettuce, third time still wilted. Manager was great, but the service was awful. We never saw our server except when he checked on other tables and not us."
Kenneth Y.,"San Francisco, CA",145,234,349,3.0,8/24/2011,"Went here for a friend's birthday dinner during a weekday and surprisingly it was pretty pack still.  It took a couple minutes before we were seated and they won't sit you down until all your guest arrived. We started off with some ice water and bread and butter.  They had two types; one was dark multi-grain bread and another like a baguette.  They both taste good but I preferred the darker multi-grain bread. For our entree, ordered the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta, and a new item menu called the Chicken Bellagio.  The portions are not too big, but if you eat a lot of the bread you may not end up finishing your meal.  I think if you order appetizer as well, definitely will not finish you entree. The Jambalaya Pasta was requested to be not spicy, but at the end it was still a bit spicy and the server did guarantee it was not spicy and was able to substitute it.  The noodles taste a bit over cooked and the shrimp was not crispy / crunchy.  The chicken was good and the sauce was good as well. The chicken Bellagio was delicious with its basil pesto sauce noodles with bread chicken breast.  The noodles were al dente and the fried chicken breast in bread Crum was crispy and the chicken was tender. I preferred the Chicken Bellagio more and would like to try something else next time.  Everything on the menu sounds really good, and nothing really wowed me.   Overall, they have a large selection of everything to choose and they specialize in their cheesecakes.  Warning though, every item on the menu is really high in calories.  The service was really alright, sometimes the server is not available. Since it was a birthday party, they came and sang happy birthday and decorated a cheesecake we ordered. **parking** Parking is available on streets or side public parking lots Cash or credit or gift cards cash or credit or gift cards"
Erica C.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,14,,4.0,8/10/2014,"I love Cheesecake Factory!! Whenever I go, it's always a pleasant time! We had the nicest waiter, very sweet! Forgot his name though. The sourdough and wheat bread is always my favorite to start, but don't eat too much otherwise you'll be full before you get your meal! Hehe. My mom and I ordered the chicken stuffed tortillas to share, it was fabulous!!! Kinda weird because they ran out of sour cream, but it was okay because the waiter offered us guacamole to replace it!  Overall my mom and I had a real good experience and I will for sure be coming back!"
Alice J.,"San Jose, CA",292,711,41,5.0,1/21/2013,"I am always excited to go to Cheesecake factory. I especially love the corn tamale cakes, spinach artichoke dip, maui salad, and hibachi steak. Even their free bread is pretty delicious. The portions are so big that I am usually stuffed before dessert. In the rare event that I have room, my favorite cheesecake flavors are the tiramisu, white chocolate macadamia nut, and the pineapple upside down. I like going to this location. There's stores to shop at, cute cafes, and also other delicious eateries in case you only want to go to Cheesecake for drinks and apps or dessert. You can find parking on the street and there's also a garage on Bryant St."
Nicole Y.,"Belmont, CA",0,2,,3.0,11/6/2014,Typical Cheesecake Factory. Yelp says they take reservations but thats only for Mon-Thurs.
