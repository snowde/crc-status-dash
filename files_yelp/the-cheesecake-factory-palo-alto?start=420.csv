Nika K.,"San Bruno, CA",241,243,116,4.0,3/4/2011,"""Don't tell them its my birthday! I'll tell them your getting married!"" ""okay fine, to you!"" ""No!"" After hearing the staff sing the third birthday song, all within the bar area. This is one of the best cheesecake factories I've been too. The wait time isn't as long as the one in the city or down in San Jose area. And the service is pretty good considering this is a chain restaurant and on peak hours during their busy days they are attentive. The bread (wheat one) is my favorite. I can eat it endlessly. The drinks are good too with a wide selection. Food was good that night, I ordered the Chicken Madeira and substituted the asparagus for bell peppers, except I told them I wanted my bell peppers to be sauteed with the chicken, but he brought it on the side, diced? Weird. And of course, the cheesecakes. Couple of favorites: -tiramisu (ultimate favorite) -chocolate tuxedo cream -dulce de leche caramel -godiva chocolate (get a glass of milk)"

Dale W.,"San Jose, CA",19,114,7,5.0,9/9/2011,"A close friend wanted to celebrate her new job, so we went to this location of the Cheesecake Factory for dinner tonight.  We arrived around 5:30 and were immediately seated with no wait. Our waitress Lisa appeared within a couple of minutes, took our beverage order and gave us our menus while filling us in on the specials, the Skinnylicious menu, and the Happy Hour menu. She came back several times until we were ready to order (we were talking instead of looking at the menu), and she was always gracious and pleasant.  Our orders were brought out promptly by someone from the kitchen, and Lisa was right there with the parmesan grater for our meals (we both ordered pasta dishes). The food was outstanding! (Four Cheese Pasta and Farfalle Pasta, if you were wondering what we ordered). We both had ice water and she refilled our glasses frequently, a definite rarity in restaurants which was greatly appreciated. We never had to search for her - she took excellent care of us during the meal, and by the time she brought our to-go boxes and to-go cheesecake with the check, we had chatted with her enough that we felt like we were becoming fast friends.  Lisa was delightful and I hope she reads this - we will be back, and will ask for her section. She is a great role model for anyone seeking outstanding customer service!"
Allison M.,"Bethlehem, PA",536,1213,177,4.0,8/31/2011,"My mom and I were in Palo Alto on a visit and she reconnected with an old friend living in the area who gave us the choice between eating here or at Il Fornaio.  After reading a review on Il Fornaio that said to come to Cheesecake Factory if given the choice, we followed their advice. The wait, as usual for a Cheesecake Factory, was long, but we stood outside so my stomach didn't have to eat itself imagining the taste of the nearby cheesecakes.  We were seated in a booth in the massive establishment and got ready to order. I was glad to see they came out with a new ""Skinnylicious"" menu that lists several of their regular entrees made in portions that humans were intended to consume.  I just wish they didn't give it a name that made you feel like such a tool for ordering from it. So instead I had the grilled portobella on a bun, with no cheese, and a green salad with balsamic vinaigrette.  The shroom was so delicious... can't go wrong with spicy mayonnaise, I feel!  And the side salad was good too, although they don't offer any low-fat or fat-free dressings, so even the balsamic vinaigrette was pretty creamy. Thankfully, I saved room for a slice of chocolate chip cookie dough cheesecake for dessert.  I took it to go, which was an unnecessarily slow process.  And once again, Cheesecake Factory didn't fail to give me wayy too much whipped cream.  But I suppose that's forgiveable when they're responsible for such a blissful state of food-euphoria."
Moriah D.,"Bay Area, CA",5,5,,1.0,5/18/2014,"WORST expierence I've ever had here! definitely disappointed from the start, we told the host table for 5 when they called our party they said table for 4, we corrected them that we had said 5, then had to wait a little more, no big deal. The bread we then received was cold, which it never is, ok, just asked for more it was then warm. Our food took 30 minutes after order to be brought out, pretty lengthy for half the restaurant being unoccupied. When I received my plate a majority of the pasta was cold I had to send it back. What's going on today cheesecake? Definitely irritated me enough to write this review."
Tek L.,"San Francisco, CA",360,15,4,4.0,2/22/2014,"What better to do on a Friday afternoon than to have happy hour here with your significant other?!  I arrived at around 5PM and the restaurant was not busy at all. It was nice not having to deal with a long wait that is usually the signature of the Cheesecake Factory experience.  Our server, Jason, was fantastic. He was funny and very approachable.  We had a blended Margarita, the crab & artichoke dip, fried mac & cheese, and the hot spinach dip. I'm definitely not the best critic for alcoholic drinks, but the Margarita was okay to me. Heavy on the alcohol (which is a good thing, right?) with a good soury, fruity taste. Way worth it during happy hour.  Crab & artichoke dip and the fried mac & cheese are MUST-ORDERs. There's so much crab flavor in the dip. I could definitely just eat the dip by itself. The fried mac & cheese are just amazing too! Irresistible and pretty filling as an appetizer.  I would recommend against ordering the hot spinach dip unless you just really love spinach. Honestly, I didn't really even get slammed with the spinach flavor when I ate the dip. Maybe my taste buds were spoiled by the other flavorful items that I ordered, but the spinach dip was mediocre at best. The chips tasted better with the salsa and sour cream that the plate came with.  I will be coming back to happy hour here in the future. I'm just going to get smarter with what I end up ordering. Oh yeah, everything is $5 on their happy hour menu. What a steal! Try the appetizers you were always unsure about paying for during dinnertime at happy hour. =)"
Laura S.,"Redwood City, CA",206,332,745,5.0,9/11/2012,"Went here for my anniversary on Sunday.  The hubby and I had spent all day on the couch... me editing a photo shoot on my laptop, and him watching football. We'd casually talked about going out for dinner somewhere, but both of us are such homebodies, and I was so into my photo editing that he finally got tired of waiting for me and ate a slice of pizza.  Well, around 9:30 I was finally done with my photos (for the day) and felt like we should do SOMETHING... but what can you do in Redwood City at 9:30? (If you live in Redwood City like we do, you know... there's almost nothing to do after 8:00... everything closes so early here!). I wasn't super hungry, but thought maybe we could go to Ihop or Denny's for dessert.  But... the thought of one of their microwaved pies or slices of cake to celebrate 3 years of marriage just didn't seem all that appealing.  On a whim I decided to see how late the Cheesecake factory is open. I used to work down the street and occasionally we'd pick up lunches from here (their luau salad is amazing). Lo and behold, I could not believe they are actually open till ELEVEN on Sunday nights! Bingo!! So we got there around 10, and had the most awesome, decadent chocolate fudge cake and coffee ice cream thing ever.  Our waiter, Will, was also very nice. My husband said, ""Our waiter is really good."" And he doesn't say always say that! Thanks Will.  This was our first time at the Cheesecake factory (in person) but... we WILL be back : )"
Sita-Marie P.,"Redwood City, CA",122,58,11,2.0,11/22/2013,"Went back a second time to see if they attempted to fix anything. Waitress was nice this time and even gave me a sample of a dessert because I wasn't sure if I wanted to order it. That was very sweet. Food was eh and the drinks were wayyyyyy too sweet. You don't need sugar in a fruit smoothie. Ugh. If it wasn't for that waitress, everything would've sucked."
Abdulrahman A.,"Stanford, CA",4,1,,1.0,5/16/2014,"Their food causes a diarrhea and stomach ache. This happened a couple of times to me, and now my little one. I am writing from ER, at 5:00 AM. Stay away!!"
Josh K.,"Jackson Heights, NY",287,1284,36,3.0,8/12/2011,"It's a nationwide ""upscale restaurant"" chain, what can you expect. The entrees are overpriced compared to their worth and can be good but are never amazing. I had a pretty decent burger there, though, with onion rings and bacon inside. But I wouldn't come back unless it were on someone else's dime or I were in the middle of nowhere. It's 2 stars for the chain at large, but +1 star for the surprisingly good burger I had."
Winglo A.,"Cupertino, CA",0,122,3,2.0,11/4/2012,"Came here an a Saturday around 5:45, about 10 minutes wait. Ordered: Rib -eye steak with french fries Mac and Cheese with fries for my little one from the kid menu Salad wrap for my wife. The food came one by one... my wife got her salad, I got my rib- eye without the fries and no steak knife. My little one got her fries. Asked for A-1, but it has about a teaspoon left. The manager came by and see how we are doing. I said no Mac and cheese and  I am half way done with my rib-eye. And I don''t have my fries. Finally and MC came and it was super hot. WHY IS THAT? Starbucks has warm chocolate milk for kid, why not warm MC?  Then I got my fries with a big onion ring on top, which was full of grease.  Our server never stay on our table and there were different servers bringing our plates, there was a lack of communication and needs to follow up on our orders. Time for an upgrade software that can tells is the table got all their food. Oh, they took the MC off the bill and gave us a complimentary cheesecake."
Pedro Juan G.,"Austin, TX",3,178,,3.0,7/31/2014,Food is standard fare and fairly consistent. Cakes and deserts are exceptional.
Subrina L.,"Anaheim, CA",25,5,39,2.0,8/11/2014,Terrible experience in this Cheese Cake factory. Was asked to wait for 15min but ended up more than 20min. The waitress was not nice at all-even though we told her that we were in a hurry she told us at least another 30min! Never had this experience in other Cheese Cake Factory restaurants. Too bad!
Sean M.,"Newark, CA",21,317,40,2.0,11/30/2014,"The food is ok, but nothing really stands out about it. The menu is just too big so there is no real focus on good taste."
Ahmed M.,"Redwood City, CA",577,5,,4.0,3/10/2015,Love this place! One of the few spots in downtown Palo Alto that's open past 10 pm and still has healthy food.
Jordan H.,"San Francisco, CA",1077,264,38,3.0,8/18/2013,"Ran out of bread for the umpteenth time, server was short with us at first, but an otherwise standard Cheesecake Factory experience.  Always check for the bar or high-top seating to avoid the wait. Often you can save yourself 15-30 minutes doing that."
John P.,"Palo Alto, CA",39,36,20,3.0,7/14/2014,"Came here for my nephew's graduation/birthday dinner. Fancy decor. Reminds you of being in Vegas at the Caesar's Palace. Prior to coming here I heard many people refer to the menu as the Bible, not because it has life lessons or anything inscribed in it, but because its such a long and cumbersome amount of food to choose from. The choices of food are not better than the other.  Here are the dishes that we ordered. Appetizers: FRESH KALE SALAD 5.95 - Fresh but so so. Something anyone can make at home. Comes with a ranch dressing mixed with blue cheese dressing. Would have preferred a vinaigrette instead.  PORTABELLA MUSHROOM, AVOCADO & ZUCCHINI FRIES 6.95 - Interesting how everyone wants to make everything into fries these days. These do not fly so well. Eat with caution, vegetables get hot when fried. The avocado one was interesting, however I would not order again FRIED CALAMARI 11.95 - Decent taste, good texture. Way too pricey. Don't know how the ones at Pier 39 do it. So good. Thats what I'm comparing it to. The portion appeared big but its not.  Main Course: JAMAICAN BLACK PEPPER SHRIMP 18.50 There were others but this was mine and the only one I ate. Meh. Shrimp is actually hard to make good unless thrown with some noodles like scampi or served plain as a cocktail. The plate came with black beans and the shrimp was mixed with some sort of cajun seasoning. Way too pricey for something that could have possibly been made with the cajun seasoning in the herb section of the grocery store. Mix some rice and shrimp and voila.  Service: White knights of the cheesecake factory. The men and women that serve here range from the 20s to upper 40s to 50s. We had three servers come to our table and one of them who brought the bread, an asian guy, said the one basket he gave us was all that was left so eat sparingly. Wth? Apparently he lied or had a terrible sense of humor because our main server, the tall blond brought us a few baskets later. Bread is raved to be really good here. Eh, not bad. Its called honey wheat bread, its a dark brown/black color. Can't really complain about the service. Water and food were served on time and refilled."
Anna H.,"Fremont, CA",0,7,2,2.0,12/30/2015,"We went for happy hour which was good. The tamale corn cakes are a great deal at only $5.50 and the house salad was a sizable portion. Overall, happy hour is great because there are over 15 appetizers, many that are half the original price. The restaurant was very crowded, but the service was still attentive. The restaurant was too dark though. We decided to come back for cheesecake later, which was a huge mistake. We had to wait 10 minutes to even order it, and then another 15 minutes to actually get our cheesecake. Some people were also waiting for their to-go order for over 30 minute. When we finally got home, we realized our was much smaller than the normal cheesecake. I've been to much better cheesecake factories, but if you are going to go here, I would recommend making a reservation or sitting at the bar area. Take-out is poorly managed here."
Mike Q.,"Mountain View, CA",340,62,17,4.0,8/27/2013,"Service - 5/5. We had a very friendly waitress who was not intrusive, very friendly, and came back to check on us an adequate number of times. Our water was always filled, and the food was prepared in a timely manner. Atmosphere - 4/5. I like the whole dimly lit vibe, and it definitely has that classy feel. Sometimes though it just feels like they're trying a little too hard (maybe a little too dim?). The mirrors in the bathroom are pretty smudgy, and stuff like that sort of shatters the illusion. Food - 4/5. The fettuccine alfredo was pretty good, but the real highlight was, of course, the cheesecake. In my opinion, they live up to their name. Such a treat."
Michael L.,"San Jose, CA",54,16,,3.0,2/18/2013,"I don't know I am bad luck or something? I received the worst service ever in my all experience with CheeseCake Factory. We were sitting there for like 10 min's (totally damm 10min's) with no one asking for a water or ready to order. Wait a minute, what time did we go to there? is 3 o'clock, with no customer, lots of empty table, and waiter and waitress were flirting each other? I was thinking about what's wrong with them, and I finally waved my hand to call for service. I totally understand is not a lunch hour or the waiter/waitress  not get too attention on the table.  Later on, the waitress keep asked ""is everything alright?' like five time within 2 hrs. Come on, I was having conversation, can you see that? With that kind of service, how can I willing to give more or extra tips to them?  Don't get wrong with me, we are not the only victims on my table section because they treat the same way to other table too. As holiday would like to enjoy a meal with love one, but I think my mood has been ruined"
