Brandon C.,"Santa Clara, CA",194,76,46,1.0,5/21/2012,"No no no no no no no no no! on this place! I dare never touch my feet into this dump ever again! why I dare write a review for this place? why i dare even rate this as a one when it deserves to be gone? Thats a mystery to me too. Anyway let me tell you MY experience here..... Went here for dinner during the day of the eclipse, and as I walk into the restaurant with my family, I immediately walk up to the front desk. I stand there waiting for the greeter to finish taking her drink. I then proceeded to state my name. It takes her and 2 other waiters to find my name. This shows me that these employees are not the brightest leaf in the batch...either that or they have had one to many drinks that day. My name is finally found, and I walk to my seat. With a miracle, I somehow get a decent waitress! She asked my group how we were doing, and where we could find her if we needed her just in case. Every time I thanked her, she replied with a thank you back. This was the only good part of the night. I look at the menu, and I am struck with many kinds of heavy foods. Not that this is a problem or anything, (oh wait it is) its just that what would people who aren't looking for a heavy meal to eat? Even the portions on the salads are enough to sustain 2-3 people! Knowing from prior knowledge of eating at other factories closer to my home, I immediately knew where to look for a good dish.  I ended up getting their so called ""award winning"" famous portabella mushroom burger. And heres where the night drops..... Now, the rest of my family ordered other horrible and fattening foods, but none were as DISGUSTING, as this!  The hamburger was made from a gray garbage or also known as left over meat that was thrown into a food processor, pureed to a thin pulp, and formed into a patty. And to add insult to failure, the cook had made my well-done patty into a rare piece of crap!  I had NOT told the waitress about this horrible experience here, because I knew that ordering here again would be a vile mistake, and I didn't want her to be hurt if this were her favorite dish. Moreover, I also didn't want my family to get involved into something that only I was completely concerned about.  P.S.* It doesn't take a cook like me, to notice that a well done hamburger should be on the grill for more than just a quick 3 minutes! Also, if you are going to serve your crap from the counter to a guest? Next time make sure they like to eat crap. Because I sure don't. Ever. Period."
Alex S.,"Mountain View, CA",398,205,32,1.0,7/16/2012,"Been here and to a lot of Cheesecake Factories in my life. This is the only place where the floor was sticky/oily... Really made the dining experience kind of awkward. Also ordered a salad with dressing on the side. Side dressing never came. Asked for it, brought me different dressing. Asked for it again, brought me different dressing. Eventually gave up and tossed the salad. I'm not sure why it is so difficult to bring the right dressing..."
Jessica X.,"Stanford, CA",210,162,39,4.0,8/13/2014,"The food is alright, but the desserts are so good! The staff is also very attentive."
Diane C.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",592,1015,529,3.0,3/31/2010,"I usually rate Cheesecake Factory with 4-5 stars but in this case, I have to lower it. I've been to many others and this one seems to be less service oriented and worse food than others. I gave it several chances before I decided to review it since once in a while there is an off day with restaurants.  Every time I had a slow waiter who didn't pay attention to what we ordered and if I asked for any hot sauce, lemon or chilly powder, it came when the food was cold.  Two times the waiter (always different guys) rather chit chat than bring our food or condiments.   The only thing I've had here that was good was the desert and the drinks.  The foods we ordered were overcooked, unspiced and generally boring.  I thought that all Cheesecakes followed the same recipe but in this case, they seem to leave things out. Not sure if we'll ever go back here again.  Four times of negative experience is a bit too much."
jun k.,"Alameda, CA",391,459,10,2.0,4/22/2011,"I think it's a beautifully decorated, really appreciated the feast for my eyes. Service was really courteous but slow and poor.  (ie, left dirty dishes, dumped our cheesecake slices we took to go upside down... i mean they could have at least put it on its side, confused a bit) food selection was large but the salads could do with less lettuce and more other things  (got the Carlton - most disappointing salad ever - I should have stuck with my dinner Chinese chicken salad..- the carlton may be advertised a certain way but there was barely any avocado, and tiny little cubes of everything else with MOUNDS of lettuce)....  my mom loved her pasta (tomato, basil, mozzarella penne) and the guacamole my dad got (lol - gotta love my classy pops!) was not spicy at all (he specified that he wanted it hot)... but there was a LOT of avocado in it. basically lunch is slightly cheaper, and the food quantities are huge.  it's just not tasty. quiet inside, and people are in there doing a wide variety of things (from eating alone with a crossword puzzle, to eating together while reading books or newspapers, etc).  In fact it was a little depressing - palo altans going out for a ""family meal"" but not really... engaging in each other. Anyway yeah, was sad when I got home and saw that my lemoncello torte (BEST DESSERT OF MY LIFE EVER) was plopped top down (squishing the whipped cream) and the mango keylime cheesecake (overly sweet, artificialish flavors, super sweet, way too sweet) was also unappetizingly packed. Honestly, they should've just given us the boxes and we could've boxed it ourselves, just like how we stacked the dirty dishes ourselves and wiped the crumbs off ourselves. the lunch was a loooot longer than it should have been, the service was SO SLOW for a quiet late lunch hour.. gosh."
Sal P.,"Santa Clara, CA",45,18,1,2.0,6/13/2014,"I have been a regular to several Cheesecake Factory locations. The food is generally great. But this branch was deceptive. They change the recipes and make them less ""tasty"". The Jamaican black pepper shrimp and bang-bang chicken shrimp were just bad here. It's as if they had used less spices. Wish they would stick with the recipes."
Danny G.,"San Francisco, CA",24,15,2,4.0,6/11/2014,"Took my family there on Friday, I read a lot of positive reviews about this particular location. I came earlier and it was the right thing to do because it got really busy, actually, I had to check at 630 pm to get the table around 8 pm! I can't believe there was an hour and half wait to eat at this restaurant. The food was simply amazing, the prices are ok, they are not cheap for this kind of restaurant but still not too bad. I had a small cesar salad and then Chicken Marsala. They were both good, especially the chicken. For dessert we had strawberry shortcake. The staff are extremely helpful and very kind. I will definitely go again. Thanks everyone at CCF for a great experience."
S C.,"San Jose, CA",115,82,59,2.0,10/4/2010,"-1 star off the bat - The men's room got some serious bad odor problem. And not talking bout the fact that someone pinched a loaf. It was the smell of a poorly ventilated bathroom that has not been cleaned for a while.  Was working late and decided to meet up with friends that just got out of an event around the area. Not that many restaurants are open past 10pm on a Wednesday night here so ultimately we limited it down to this place.  Very typical Cheesecake Factory. The waitress was fairly attentive and nice.  We ordered the following (might not have the names down 100% but should be close enough):  1) Dynamite Shrimp Tempura ( ) I'm not sure if it's because this was the first item that showed up but I thought this was awesome. I'd come back for this again. The tempura had the perfect level of crisp and the dipping sauce was delish  2) Thai Noodle Salad ( ) Again... great job cheesecake factory  3) Garlic Noodle - with Chicken ( )  As you can see from my other reviews, I really like garlic. Unfortunately, this one I won't be ordering again. The noodles were bland as was the chicken.  On top of that, the chicken meat was quite dry... 4) Blue-cheese Bacon Burger ( ) Friend ordered this. Not sure what it tastes like but he said it was awesome. 5) Strawberry cheesecake ( ), Reese's peanut butter cheesecake ( ). Both were great. My favorite here however is the carrot cake. MMMmmmmm I gave this place 3 stars because it is the ordinary run of the mill cheesecake factory.  But the bathroom needs to be cleaned on some sort of schedule."
Gerry K.,"Birkenwerder, Germany",1,4,,5.0,4/23/2015,"Good place to be. Aircon too cold, but that's maybe how most guests prefer it. Liked the coctails, too"
Jeremy K.,"San Martin, CA",18,179,24,1.0,6/17/2012,"Are u freakin kidding me? another reason why I don't do this place. First of all, they don't take reservations, and when a friend calls twice to get it, that is bull shiet when she is told its all set but when u really get there, ha ha fooled u sucka! No reservation ready yet, we can put u on the list now for your party of 20.  so not only did we have to wait 1 hour when we got there early, we had to wait another 1 before we even got seated.  We were so close to walking out to the restaurant down the street.   When it came to the food, it was meh...nothing to fancy about.  A few of the other ppls dishes were either over cooked salmon or too dry steaks.  Not really good reviews for the food.  They even miss fired on our entrees. 2 ppl in our party didn't get there food until 20 minutes later, when almost everyone at the table was done eating...really bad!  Not acceptable!  The plus of the night was that when I wanted a beer at the bar, I got my beer at the bar.  easy peasey.  I wouldn't come back unless its for a friend or a business event that I couldn't help persuade the organizer not to do here. ;-P"
Ellie J.,"Redwood City, CA",0,2,,1.0,7/3/2015,"Love the place , food is OK , worst of all HORRIBLE service , every time I go it just gets worse . Save yourself some time & head to Hillsdale Cheesecake Factory ! 10x better !"
Anime P.,"Palo Alto, CA",0,3,,3.0,12/25/2014,I love the costumer service there! But everytime i go there they always take forever to get my food to me even on days where it's not that busy..
Steve L.,"San Mateo, CA",833,684,1066,4.0,1/16/2010,"The wife was on a out shopping on a girls' day out, so it was just the kids mid week during the recent Saturday. Asked where they wanted to go, and they both said Cheesecake Factory. Typically, one can expect a long wait for a table at any CF location, but since we had no plans that day, we had time to wait. Also, I didn't want to drive up to SF or Santa Clara for a CF. Then I remembered there was one in Palo Alto, and since we haven't ate at this location yet, I figured we'd just head here.  After finding a parking spot, walked down a short block on University, and entered the through the large doors of the Cheesecake Factory. We saw the cheesecake displays on the right (yes, we were looking for them), and the front desk on left. I was expecting to see some people waiting up front, but surprisingly, there was hardly anyone. The host met us, and immediately seated us.  Waitperson immediately greeted us, then came back a few minutes later for our orders.  OUR ORDER:  -Kids bow tie pasta with butter and Parmesan: In typical CF portions, even the portions of the kid's plate was pretty big. Pasta was hot, and my daughter happy.  -Four-cheese Penne: My oldest was craving this, so she ordered the lunch-sized portion. Still pretty sizable. This pasta is made with mozzarella, Parmesan, Romano, and Ricotta (scooped on the side), in a marinara and basil sauce. Also arrived hot, with the cheese string and gooey with each forkful.  -Cuban Sandwich: A pork and ham sandwich, with Swiss cheese, pickles, mustard and mayo, on a roll, grilled until flat. Pork was a little on the dry side, but still tasty nonetheless.  Cheesecake? We'll make room for cheesecake. It was the real reason why the girls wanted to come here. No kid sized cheesecakes for my girls. They wanted the full size (yes, the are my girls).  -30th Anniversary Chocolate Cake Cheesecake ( ): Cheesecake layered between chocolate cake, with a very rich cream cheese frosting and chocolate cream. Woo this was rich, but so good.  -Oreo Cheesecake ( ): My daughter was happy.  I figured I would ""help"" them enjoy their cheesecakes, so I didn't order any for myself.  Cheesecake Factory restaurants are known for their huge quantities of food, and of course, their cheesecakes. Food is OK to pretty good, but the long waits for a table usually turn me off. I found this true for almost all CF I've dined around the country.  There was no wait at this location, and the servers were friendly and efficient. For these, I'd give this location another star."
Daniel K.,"Mountain View, CA",55,154,,1.0,5/30/2012,"Came here during Mother's day which was probably a mistake to begin with.  However, I don't think that is an excuse for such poor service.  We were told that the wait was 30 minutes and we were ok with that.  The wait actually turned out to be over an hour. After we put in our orders we received our appetizer in about 5-10 minutes which is good but the entrees took over 30 minutes after we were done with the appetizer. There was just far too much waiting from beginning to end here."
Matt T.,"Milpitas, CA",48,32,10,2.0,4/3/2013,"I went here the other day and ordered a salad, one of the worst salads I've ever had. It tasted bitter, and little to no dressing was on the salad. On top of this it took nearly 30 minutes for the salad to arrive, I literally ate through two breads waiting so long! I definitely won't be going here for the food until they step their game up. However the one in Valley Fair seems to know whats up!"
Johnson C.,"Palo Alto, CA",73,188,86,4.0,3/13/2013,"Great place to host friends coming from oversea. This location can be crowded for dinner on weekdays.  Favorite dishs :  Cheese Cake - Of Course !!!  Stawberry Cheese cake, chocolate cheese cake Spicy Ahi tempura roll Firecracker salmon Fried zucchini kobe burger bbq chicken pizza chicken bellagio 4 cheese pasta my recommendation would be ""family style"" dinner whereby you can order many different appetizers and entrees so that you can enjoy best of all yummy stuffs at a go."
Jiwon K.,"San Francisco, CA",414,169,473,4.0,12/27/2012,"A lot of my friends wrinkle their noses at Cheesecake Factory, but honestly it is one of my favorite restaurants in Palo Alto. They have a lot on their menu, so if you try to experiment you might find dishes that don't fit your tastebuds. My personal favorites are: Papas bravas Dynamite shrimp Spicy chicken chipotle pasta Garlic noodles (with shrimp) Also, I absolutely love their strawberry lemonade. It is just the right amount of fresh, tart, and sweet. More importantly, the refills are free! I have gotten up to six refills one Sunday afternoon when I ate alone here watching an episode of Archer on my laptop. I have a suspicion that my waitress felt sorry for me eating alone - she kept asking me if I needed a refill every 5 minutes! Minus one star for the sometimes excruciatingly slow service, but otherwise great place for a nice, filling lunch or dinner!"
Betty N.,"Beverly Hills, CA",5000,1628,1618,4.0,12/26/2009,"Yes. I was at Cheesecake Factory. And guess what, I liked it. Cruising in downtown PA after 10PM, you have very limited culinary options. And no, I am not going to Pizza My Heart. We were seated promptly at a booth with no issues or waiting at 10:15PM. Very good and very happy. Ordered the Cobb Salad ($13.95). It came out on a massive platter, piled mile high. Like massive. I couldn't finish it. It hit the spot and I didn't feel greasy or guilty afterwards. Of course, there is cheesecake for dessert, but with more than 200 food selections, you can opt out. RECOMMEND CF for late-night eats in downtown PA."
Obeela O.,"San Jose, CA",3,99,15,3.0,9/20/2014,"Food is the same as all other cheesecake factories.  3 star rating due to terrible service. I have made excuses, such as perhaps it was just too busy, but on more than one occasion even with calmer times, it has not been great. Also on more than one occasion they got my order wrong. An example, our food took forever to come (understandable at times). However everyone had theirs except for one person, she ordered a simple grilled cheese. It came as the others were finishing up and then we sat there awkwardly as we waiting for her to finish."
Monty P.,"San Diego, CA",0,9,,1.0,5/24/2015,"We have frequently eaten at the Palo Alto Cheesecake Factory. Tonight will likely be our last. I order the same thing every time: the spicy crispy chicken sandwich with buffalo sauce and melted cheddar. It rarely arrives as ordered. I have sent it back before, but it gets tiresome. Tonight it was obvious that whatever cheese that had been on the sandwich was scraped off -- along with most of the buffalo sauce -- and a cold piece of cheddar was thrown on in its place. There was no accompanying bleu cheese. My wife's salad was not as ordered. My daughter's child pasta was lukewarm and rubbery. The server was friendly and apologetic, but the kitchen is awful. It's our fault we keep coming back, but I think we've finally had it."
