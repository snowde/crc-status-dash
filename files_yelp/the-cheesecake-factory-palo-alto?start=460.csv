Melody K.,"Los Angeles, CA",621,265,78,1.0,11/22/2011,"The ambiance, menu and food is good. It's like all other cheesecake factories.  But the service at the Palo Alto location is horrible! Absolutely awful!! I would give them a zero if I could. I've been there 3 times in the past two months and all three times the exact same things happened.  You get greeted and taken to your table. Your server comes and asks for drinks and brings the drinks. Then disappears. Your bread comes ages later. They finally come to take your order. They get the order wrong, EVERY TIME! Then they correct it and before you have the chance to even taste the food, they ask how everything is. They keep coming by too many times during the first few minutes, even the manager comes to ask questions. It's so annoying! Can I eat my food that I waited so long for before it gets cold??!! But then they disappear again. Don't even think about refills or having the food boxed up when your done. You sit there forever till they come back. They bring the bill and you ask for the box. Your bill is ready but no one picks it up. After a long time they do. Then they come back 2 or 3 times apologizing for the wait, there's something wrong with... or they are waiting for... whatever! By the time you get out of there, everything has been so awkward and out of place and at the wrong time you just know it so wasn't worth it.  I will never return to this location again. I will drive 30 minutes to Valley Fair. Everything is better there!"
Rick B.,"Menlo Park, CA",1,17,1,3.0,6/30/2014,"I have sparsely attended Cheesecake Factories in the past.  Only because they get so crowded.  I happened to have a very nice dinner with some co-workers.  Wasn't loud at all.  Very pleasant.  The menu is so vast, it can take some time to decide.  Dinner and cheese cake for desert.  Will go back."
Suzanne P.,"Menlo Park, CA",0,26,,1.0,2/18/2014,"My kids like going here- but i most definitely dont. I think a menu of this size speaks to how much in the kitchen is frozen, not fresh. We have a family joke- literally every time we have been here over YEARS, our waiter goes on ""break"" and introduces us to their replacement. It never fails.  My biggest problem took place the last time i will ever eat there- my boyfriend ordered pretzel chicken. He then ate 2 pieces and asked me if it looked ""weird""?  It was COMPLETELY pink and raw. Like COLD inside. It had clearly Just been dropped in the fryer, cooking the outside only. The manager didnt even offer to bring anything else! This place is in big trouble if they get a child or an elderly person ill. Its no joke.  It grossed ME out enough... And as i said... A menu of this size screams that the ingredients are not fresh. They must have a gigantic freezer. I do like some of their menu options, nice that theyve added low cal entrees. If i thought they had it together id be back, but they dont."
Ariel H.,"Fremont, CA",4,26,3,1.0,2/2/2015,"Honestly i never take the time to review chain restaurants but my experience here was just plain bazaar. The waitress was extremely slow and not only in action but as well as taking the order and understanding what we wanted. We asked for the Kentucky tea and the pineapple Moscow mule, both drinks are on the menu. When we ordered them she seemed very confused and repeated our drink order 3 different times then stated how she doesnt know much about cocktails since she takes shots. Ok, but both drinks are on the menu. We also ordered the crab dip, we waited over 40 mins for it to arrive. When the dip finally arrived it had a crust over it from clearly waiting too long under the heat lamp, gross. At this point i had lost my patience and asked a host to send a manager to my table. Trust me she wasnt much help either. She clearly didnt understand i wanted a new dip made and we waited another 15 mins for another round of drinks. A team is only as strong as management leads them to be. I don't often eat at Cheesecake Factory but when I do again, if ever, it wont be at this one."
Kelly O.,"Belmont, CA",0,1,,1.0,3/16/2014,"I have never had such AWFUL service! I will never go to this Cheesecake Factory EVER AGAIN! My server was SHANTALLE and she did multiple things wrong.  1.) She did not come to my table for about 15 minutes after I was seated by the hostess. Supposedly, she ""wasn't aware"" my table was her table. SERIOUSLY?! YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW YOUR SECTION?!?!?!!??! 2.) She did not check on my table ONE TIME while I was waiting for my food OR while I was eating. 3.) I was seated around 10PM (I went late because I wanted to avoid the busy hours) and it took about 30-45 minutes for my food to get to my table. (IT WAS NOT BUSY AT ALL). 4.) I had asked for some more bread because I was STARVING and supposedly they were baking more bread.. How are you going to run a business and not have the complimentary appetizer available?!? People go to your restaurant because they are HUNGRY!! Over-all, this was the worst service I have ever received from a restaurant. I will not be returning to this location. And I definitely DID NOT tip Shantalle! In my book, you EARN your tips. Made my bill a little cheaper anyways. haha I GIVE THIS PLACE A -5 STAR! (it wouldn't let me post unless I clicked a star so my 1 star is NOT ACCURATE!"
Ang L.,"San Francisco, CA",131,96,6,3.0,7/27/2015,"I love the Cheesecake Factory. Out of all the chain restaurants, this is the only one I frequent. This particular location used to be my favorite because it offered a lovely stroll before and after, and quite frankly, the wait time was more decent than other locations. However, things have been changing here. I feel as if it's losing its class, and it begins with the reception desk. Not very friendly, looks annoyed, and takes awhile to look up from whatever it is she's doing. While my server was nice, the place is looking older and dirtier, and it takes awhile for the server to even get to you. I remember when the rule was they had to check in with you after your first bite. That didn't happen. And this would have to be my third time letting them know their women's restroom needed attendance. Toilet paper on the floor vs. on the roll...and it's everywhere. The food is still good for the most part, but I might have to settle for the longer waits at the locations that are still being taken care of."
Sharon S.,"Newmarket, Canada",23,238,33,4.0,9/24/2010,The food is hot and the service is good.  The portions are over the top in size.  Tonight I ordered chicken medallions and it had 3 chicken breasts with a huge mount of rice.  We tried the banana cream cheesecake it was very good.  It wasn't over top in sweetness or richness..
Mari R.,"San Jose, CA",14,22,,3.0,10/24/2014,I don't think I could ever get enough of this place... but I am not fond of long waiting times prior to being seated at a table.
Michael A.,"Palo Alto, CA",41,9,,3.0,9/30/2014,"Went for a casual lunch. Surprisingly, the restaurant wasn't crowded I ordered the Tuscany chicken and my wife ordered the beef dip sandwich. The chicken was great, but the sandwich was overcooked. Despite not being crowded, our food took way too long to arrive at the table. Overall, it was an average experience."
Marijana K.,"Dublin, Republic of Ireland",8,3,2,5.0,9/29/2014,"Exceptional service and really tasty, quality meals! Warm bread with butter, refills, wide variety of menu choices. Waiting staff is very easy-going and waiters always gave us a lot of attention. We always love to return there!"
Linda C.,"Redwood City, CA",0,5,,3.0,10/30/2014,"Went on a Wednesday for lunch.  There was no wait and they weren't very busy, but the service was incredibly slow.  The food was decent, but nothing to write home about.  Your best bet is to eat anywhere else on University Ave. and then stop by for a slice of cheesecake to go."
July K.,"Fremont, CA",0,3,,4.0,10/12/2015,I like this place. I often bring my family and friends there because of the convenient location and good food for a reasonable price. Portions are pretty big to feed everyone. Their coffee and cheesecakes are delicious.
Rawan W.,"Redwood City, CA",45,4,,1.0,11/17/2013,"I'm usually a fan of this place, but the experience we just had was not its best. We came for a celebratory dinner for my moms birthday- the waiter was nice, could have been more attentive(like bring us some water before our dinner perhaps?) but that isn't the major issue. The issue was our dinner.. Plates came out one by one and my mother's.. The birthday girl.. Her plate was lost... The manager came out apologized and said there was an error and it would be out in 4 minutes ... 15 minutes later.. Tah dah! She got chewy.. Far from al dente angel hair and some shrimp... She gave up- said she wasn't hungry anymore and we all  quickly lost our appetite.. We sent it back and got the check... Yep.. The check.. Minus her meal and a 25% of discount (which was nice) but it still ruined the evening...  The waiter proceeded to tell us that the cooks were in training... Awesome."
Katja J.,"Hamburg, Germany",1,180,210,5.0,4/18/2011,I love Cheescake Factory. They have everything. Love their food selection and the desserts are a woman's dream:) The cheesecakes are sooo good. And the tiramisu is made with real mascarpone!  The portions are huge! We never finish them. We always take doggie bags and have another lunch/dinner the next day. That's why I think the prices are ok! The only thing is that the food is usually too salty.  The service is always great!
Tyffanee S.,"Palo Alto, CA",2,104,1,1.0,1/5/2014,Two words: food poisoning. (It's University Ave -- so many choices! Don't give this ghastly chain your business.)
Lusi F.,"Stanford, CA",259,182,22,4.0,12/18/2012,"This review is for anyone looking to host an event here, especially brunch.  I'd highly recommend this location. The management was responsive, helped us pick out and print out a smaller menu, and reserved the whole back section of the restaurant for us (enough for 120 people). Many guests for this party showed up at the last minute, so even though we reserved for 70, 92 showed up, but they were great at accommodating everyone. The brunch menu is great, large portions, so one entree and one drink fulfilled everyone. They could have prepared a bit better by staffing it with more people, as it took a while for us to order/get the food, and they ran out of french toast (when two options on the select menu involved french toast) so better planning could be done knowing that we had a large party. All in all, it's a great location, nice decor, good ambiance, friendly management.  They even comped us champagne!"
Summer K.,"San Jose, CA",0,12,,1.0,12/1/2013,"First, let me just say that I have been a regular customer here for nearly a decade. My husband and I have spent countless anniversaries and dates here. But I won't be going again anytime soon.  I am a vegetarian, have been for 15 years. The last time I ingested meat by accident I wound up in the hospital. Well, this evening I bit into what I *thought* was fried portabella (cause ya know, that is what I ordered) and it was actually fried chicken. Totally get that people make mistakes and its not the end of the world, but when my husband went back to tell the management, he was refunded the order (but not the rest that I just finished throwing up- because like I said, vegetarian for 15 years- my body does not like meat!), and was not offered a certificate or anything. I have worked in service, I would have handled that a lot differently. Overall, a waste of money and time. Their customer service has been steadily declining the past few years, I will take my business elsewhere."
Jenna F.,"Palo Alto, CA",0,2,,1.0,3/31/2014,"I have been a patron of The Cheesecake Factory for about 10 years, which started in high school. Last Friday was the first time I was dissatisfied with the service, food and management.  It had been a while since dining at a Cheesecake Factory, so for my cousin's fairwell dinner, the six of us decided to eat here. We had two waiters, which in and of itself is odd considering we were only a six-top. The male waiter took our order.  We proceeded to have good conversation. then about 45 minutes after we ordered, the female waitress came by and said that it would be another 3-4 minutes because the kitchen was slammed (now I work in the food industry, so I understand when the kitchen gets busy). However when another 15-20 minutes passed without any food, we started wondering whether they forgot about our food. The manager even came by to apologize for the wait (which was good of her to check). When our food finally came and all of us received our dishes except for my boyfriend's, the waitress asked him if he ordered anything! It was appalling that she asked because she could have easily checked in the system. My boyfriend responded with a curt, ""Yes"" and she replied with ""Oh, I didn't take the order"" !!!  My boyfriend did get his food in the end. By this point neither of us want to eat. My uncle's food (he ordered the crusted salmon, which comes with some steak) was over cooked and tough (he had ordered medium rare). When I mentioned something to the waiter, he proceeded to take away the food, which meant my uncle had to wait even longer (though I admit, I may be partially to blame for his food being taken).  Finally, when we spoke to the manager about compensation for such a horrible meal, she only took 25% off the bill, without any voucher/discount to return to the restaurant. In the end, I blame the management for lack of training. Lack of instructing their staff how to deal with customers, how to alleviate a situation with upset customers. Because of this bad experience, likely my returning to the Cheesecake Factory is not going to happen in the near future or maybe ever."
Ti P.,"San Jose, CA",0,6,,2.0,9/7/2015,Didn't even make it to dinner. The service of the hostess was horrific. She acted as if she didn't want to be there and it was our fault for making her work.
Tina L.,"San Mateo, CA",25,3,,4.0,7/29/2014,Celebrated my birthday recently and the service was good and the cheesecake rocks. Try the S'more cheesecake. Yum.
