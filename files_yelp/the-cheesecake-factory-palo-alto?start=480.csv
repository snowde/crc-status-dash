Rewsen D.,"San Carlos, CA",5,9,3,4.0,5/24/2012,Hard to choose a meal from the menu for first time customer of me because there was too much choices. The meal was great and good serving from the funny waiter and waitress. There is one star is missing because of the plastic water glasses.
Shelly T.,"San Francisco, CA",24,89,84,4.0,1/24/2012,"I've only ever gotten cheesecake to go here, so I'll let my review speak just for that. One great thing about the Cheesecake Factory is that they have tons and tons of, well, cheesecake. It's not something I can eat every week (although I can't lie, I really want to), but on special occasions I'll drop in and nab a slice.  The first time I came here with a friend, we wanted to sit at a table and catch up over some dessert, but we were told only restaurant patrons could sit inside. Bummer! I'd rather have gone to a cafe and gotten a pastry, but we'd already picked what flavor cheesecake to get (an agonizingly slow and painstaking process). The other couple times I've always gotten either the turtle pecan cheesecake (so good for you pecan and chocolate lovers out there!) and the coconut cheesecake for the coconut enamored bf. I love that they give scrumptious cheesecake with a fat dollop of calorific whipped cream for that extra sugar rush that I love. Sometimes you have to very expressly get the attention of someone at the register to let them know you want a slice to go since they're often busy with long lines of people. It gets packed so come early to get dessert before dinner!"
Carrie H.,"Mountain View, CA",19,89,200,3.0,1/3/2011,"I was told there's always a long wait at Cheesecake Factory but surprisingly, there was no wait when I came here at 8pm on a Friday night. My friend recommended the Vietnamese shrimp summer rolls - rice paper rolls with asparagus, shiitake mushroom, carrots, rice noodles, green onion, cilantro and shrimp. Very flavorful other than the skin of the rolls was too thick. The garlic noodles with shrimp, fresh asparagus, shiitake mushrooms and parmesan in a delicious garlic sauce was a nice and light meal for a not too hungry stomach. The tiramisu was mediocre as the coffee liqueur was not strong enough for my taste. The staff was really polite and helpful. The interior décor reminds me of Caesars Palace at Vegas. Ambiance would be nicer if the restaurant wasn't too loud. To conclude, 3 stars for the food and 4 stars for the service."
Francois P.,"Santa Clara, CA",36,65,78,3.0,12/30/2012,"Just ok , not the big deal people seems to have for this place.  The cheese cake in good, but I am not a specialist to judge that."
Chris O.,"Redwood City, CA",0,42,3,4.0,5/26/2013,"The food was very good. Can't say the same about customer service. After ordering a Turkey Club I was told they were out of turkey. OK, so I asked if they could use chicken instead. Sure they could, but would have to charge more because it was grilled. Wrong answer.  If you're out of what's offered on the menu at that time, maybe you should give me the substitute for the same price?  It's only chicken!   Moreover, when I got halfway into the sandwich I realized it was not the ""Club"" as described, but a chicken, cheese & avocado thing.  Again, it was delicious but, not exactly what I ordered."
Iris Y.,"Saratoga, CA",194,363,1654,3.0,8/15/2010,"This is the typical cheesecake factory, nothing but the consistency. Service though, was good at the front desk and bussers who were attentive. Our waiter didn't give any info on the day's special or recommendations. We came in a big group so that could have been a plus for him. Otherwise, the staff let 12 of us get in properly- we made it 1 hour earlier than our dining time because they don't take reservations after 5pm. We had a lot of goodie bags and gifts taking space due to an intern closing ceremony and they accomodated us  well with the seating.  I had a chinese chicken salad, not very salad lotsa crispies and topping. I also had a wasabi crust ahi tuna which was interesting- I can't make it at home so it was good I guess. But the Crazy Craig's Carrot Cheesecake did not let me down! nom nom I killed that poor thing real quick while others felt headaches coming from sugar overload :D I don't know how I lasted through the cake but I did! It's worh consuming all the calories and can be burned afterward!  There's a lot to do around the area too, so doing a stroll before/after eating is highly recommended!  Average but 3.5 for location and good service!"
Sue A.,"Sausalito, CA",26,27,3,4.0,9/6/2012,"We come here a lot. My dude loves that he gets to choose his own huge cheese cake, and there are so many choices.    The portions are HUGE for entrees and its good to share or take half home. I love the selection of food. I always eat clean food here like grilled fish, steamed veg and brown rice but its fantastic that my son and husband can get their messy, deep-fried and unusual choices here too.     They are always accommodating as well.  But, a bit pricey.. Id rather have smaller portions and less on the bill thank you very much.  That is the minus one star."
Erica S.,"Fremont, CA",5,14,9,4.0,1/6/2013,Ordered the Thai Lattice Wraps and Burger.   The lattice in Thai Lattice Wraps was very fresh and the Thai source were well made.   The burger was very juicy.    The service was very good.  Our waitress was very attentive.
Scott L.,"San Mateo, CA",12,15,3,1.0,2/15/2014,"I'm confused. This place was crowded but the food was tasteless and expensive to boot. I ordered the fettucine and it was bland (how do you do that? It takes actual skill to make fettucine not have flavor). I thought I would try the cheese cake, after all that is their name-sake. Not good. Bland again. We won't be returning any time soon."
Hany P.,"Melbourne, Australia",14,14,5,4.0,11/6/2012,"I was heading back to San Jose from Redwood City and the traffic on the freeway was  ridiculous. Decided to stop off for dinner at The Cheesecake Factory, which immediately springs to mind as a dinner destination... kind of like how you go to the Pancake Parlour for their steaks. As far as first impressions go, I have to say this place was outstanding. High ceilings, tastefully fitted out, slightly dimmed mood lighting and jazzy music that was loud enough to add ambience and not too loud as to overpower conversations. All of this made for the perfect setting to take a beautiful dinner companion. On to the food - the menu is extensive which does me no good at all as I have an incredibly hard time deciding. I settled on the Chicken Madeira which had mushrooms, mash and asparagus in a wine sauce and ordered some fried calamari as an entree. I probably spoiled my appetite by eating the calamari as the servings here are quite large even for an entree, but my general impression was that the food was tasty but heavy as the traffic on 101-South after work... My fiancee had a salmon salad which when I tasted it, it was cold but I believe that's how it was supposed to come out. I usually don't care much for salads at all so I won't comment but she said that ""I would usually give it a 4, but for what I wanted to eat tonight, this is a 5"". Overall, an enjoyable experience but certainly not a 5. It takes a lot for me to give a 5-star rating and this place was let down by a few things: - the bill came to me whilst I was in the middle of eating my main which is something I absolutely hate - I think I found a hair in my garlic aioli calamari dip. Normally this is grounds for an instant one-star but I'll let this one slide because I'm not sure if it was my own hair... - the service I was merely okay. Don't get me wrong, everything came out promptly (including the bill), but to get a 5, I need the waiters to engage in some humourous banter! Didn't get a chance to try the cheesecake; I generally don't like cheesecake anyway because I find it quite sour on my palette. Probably would have been a 3 but the decor and ambience deserves an extra star."
Bryant C.,"Los Angeles, CA",871,411,1124,2.0,2/21/2012,White waiters can be rude sometimes. Great happy hour. Too bad food is often underseasoned or watered down compared to other cheesecake factories.
Matt V.,"Sunnyvale, CA",672,313,59,3.0,1/29/2012,"I've been here a few times, and there's not much that sets it apart from other Cheesecake Factories. The ambiance inside the restaurant is decadent. There are high ceilings and swanky decor bathed in yellow lights. Large pillars run from the floor to the ceiling; it feels very fancy. The restaurant is usually very crowded, and there's a lot of noise from all the patrons in the restaurant. Hard to get seated immediately unless you have a reservation. Service is okay, although there will be stretches of time when you don't see your server at all, even if your glass of water or basket of bread is empty. This is probably because there are so many patrons in the restaurant, all of whom keep the servers quite busy. The food is decent enough; I like the Cashew Chicken, especially, which is a nice spicy dish served with green onions and roasted cashews. The menu claims that it's a Mandarin dish, but I doubt that. Honestly, I doubt that it was even inspired by a Mandarin dish! Hard to avoid the cheesecake at the end of the meal, too! I think my favorite is the Oreo cookie cheesecake! Definitely puts a good end to the meal! Overall, Cheesecake Factory is a chain, and isn't anything too special. There are some items on their menus that I like well enough, but there are also a lot of items on the menu that I meet with a resounding ""meh."""
Chi L.,"Union City, CA",6,257,26,3.0,12/26/2012,"Just went to cheesecake factory tonight. The line is short, tonight is wednesday after christmas, not that busy.  1) bread arrive very late 2) Mushroom soup taste good, but slightly too salty 3) Husband order fish taco, the portion is very good , 3 taco , plus bean and rice (good deal) 4) ordered Santa Fe salad, the plate is so big portion (can't finish , even with 2 persons 5) crab cake is so so, feel pretty oily, slightly burnt. Taste is good though. Too full to even get dessert,  not bad for a ""chain"" restaurant, will come back again, even services are pretty ""slow""."
Diane A.,"Palo Alto, CA",426,228,449,3.0,7/30/2011,"This specific Cheesecake Factory is a-ok. The waits here are usually shorter than the other CF's I've been to and the service is average, if a little slow. They have a huge variety on their menu, which can be overwhelming at times. The food is pretty consistent and we haven't had any problems."
Warda D.,"Eureka, CA",68,134,155,3.0,12/4/2013,"The place was fancy. No vents in the restaurant, it smelled so strong. Meals were very oily and huge portions. Cheesecake is to die for"
T. C.,"Sacramento, CA",37,165,61,1.0,7/6/2011,"Here is my secret shame.  I LIKE Cheesecake Factory.  Yes, I know it's a chain.  Yes, I know they are secretly feeding you five gazillion calories any time you order a dish there.  Yes, I know that applies even if you order a salad--sized to feed a family of five.  I don't care.  I like it and I especially love their BBQ chicken salad.   Let me tell you what I DON'T love though.  Ordering a BBQ chicken salad to go only to find when you get home that 1) they gave you the wrong dressing.  SURPRISE!  You're having ASIAN chicken salad now because that's the kind of dressing they decided to throw in your to-go box! 2) they overcooked the chicken.  Like WAYYYYYY overcooked the chicken.  Like, blackened chicken style chicken.  If I had wanted to consume carcinogens, I would have just sucked on the exhaust pipe of my dinner date's car that he kept bragging about on the drive over.  Also, they failed to throw bread in the bag and I live for that rye bread.  So, double boo. Triple boo for the fact that they forgot the wasabi dressing in the ahi tuna salad that my dinner date ordered as well! While I will continue to go to Cheesecake Factory for the BBQ chicken salad, I am SUPER glad that I live nowhere near this location."
Felix M.,"Orange County, CA",111,185,,2.0,6/6/2011,"Great at first but the novelty quickly wears off. Food just isn't that great. The cheesecake is good though, so go eat somewhere else and pick up a couple slices for dessert. I would have given this place an extra star, but he last time I  went there, they made me wait 45 minutes for a table after telling me on the phone I'd only have to wait 10."
Lindsey O.,"San Francisco, CA",60,117,48,4.0,7/17/2013,"I am writing this because I think this place should pop up on Yelp search when people Yelp ""happy hour"" in Palo Alto.  Cheesecake Factory has great HH menus that I believe last till 6pm on weekdays (don't quote me on it since I didn't google the latest info).  I never thought to order mojitos @ TCF until I visited one of their HH's - and oh boy am I glad I discovered them!  They are great!  Stop by for a cold one & some reduced-price grubs, and feel free to thank me for my Yelp entry :P"
Cherie S.,"Sunnyvale, CA",789,205,188,4.0,11/20/2011,"You can get a relatively ""healthy"" and relatively quick (less than an hour) lunch every day of the week at the Cheesecake Factory. If you're not on a diet, we all know about ""the book"" AKA The Menu, containing over 200 menu selections including ""Glamburgers"". Note: you do not feel very glamorous after devouring one of these monsters. If you're feeling decadent, order the red velvet cheesecake. And don't you dare count those 1500 calories! I'm trying to shed a few pounds and I blame that wicked-but-worth-it red velvet cheesecake. Enter the ""SkinnyLicious"" Menu at Cheesecake Factory which is awesome! They have numerous large salads all under 590 calories. One of my favorites is the Endive Salad with radicchio, glazed pecans, blue cheese crumples tossed in a vinaigrette. Also on the ""low cal menu"" are: crispy crab bites, salmon rolls, chicken potstickers, and ahi carpaccio. They even have a ""SkinnyLicious"" hamburger or veggie burger.  Bonus: an assortment of cocktails under 150 calories. The service is always friendly and portions are satisfying. It's not too loud, so you can actually have a conversation here. It's rarely crowded, so it's easy to get in and out for lunch!"
Nick J.,"Orange County, CA",99,349,2094,2.0,5/15/2011,"First Impressions:  This might be bias, but I hate Cheescake Factory.  No hunger deserves to wait 2 hrs for mediocre food.   Service:  From beginning to end, you get a pager at the front, 45 minutes later they tell you wait to the left, 10 minutes later a host/hostess seats you and makes small talk, 10 minutes later your server comes.  At this time I am ready for some bread because I am so hungry and know what I am going to order.  The server comes and tell you the special for the deal and tries to confuse you. (Not a bad thing), but I wish I would know about the special before I made up my mind an hour ago while waiting.  In general the server was catering, here and there all the time.  Taste:  Bleeehhh.  After reading the novel (disguised as a menu), you better watch out.  I have hit a few grenades eating at this and other cheesecakes.  When I mean grenades, I mean horrible food!  There are some that are decent.  The Louisiana pasta is ok. Specialty:  This might be really obvious, the cheesecake. Price: $25/person (with dessert) Recommendations:   I love their seasonal Pumpkin Cheesecake (not very fond of the Pumpkin Pecan).  I also like the dulce leche, Godiva, oh what the heck, I love them all.  I would Cheesecake give it 2.75 stars if you didn't have to wait for an hour, no novel menu, and not so many grenades on the menu."
