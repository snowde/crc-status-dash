John S.,"New York, NY",0,31,,1.0,1/26/2015,"Food is not amazing, but the service is truly the worst. Food going to the wrong table. We couldn't get seated as no one would talk to us. Asked for the check 3 times and got none, so we left cash on the table. Also servers were generally ignoring us. Will not return"
Cindy L.,"Alameda, CA",42,98,282,4.0,12/30/2013,"Really liked this particular Cheesecake Factory, such friendly service and atmosphere was fun. Wouldn't mind coming here again :)"
Janice L.,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",16,16,49,1.0,7/29/2013,"Okay food. Worst service ever. I've been here a few times and service is usually okay--not great, but whatever, I can deal with it. The last time I came here the service was just horrible. I'm not a high maintenance customer by any means so if I am writing a bad review then it really is just awful service.  Our waitress was so slow with everything. Taking our orders, getting us drinks, getting us bread, getting us utensils... Pretty much anything that a waitress is suppose to do. She also didn't even ask if we wanted drink refills once. I had to walk over to the bar and ask the bartender, who asked where I was sitting and then sent the waitress over. We asked for new forks after ordering cheesecake for dessert and didn't get those for a good 5-10 minutes so we just sat there unable to eat it because she had cleared our old utensils away.  She came by twice at the very beginning of the meal within a few minutes of each other to check on how we were doing, but of course we didn't need anything because we had just gotten our food. After that, she never checked on us again and was impossible to flag down. This was on a Monday night so it wasn't even that busy. It took 2 hours for a dinner of three very simple dishes even though we ate fairly fast and got the check right after finishing up.  I entered the restaurant in a good mood, and left very irritated by the poor service. I didn't even get her name because she wasn't around long enough for me to ask. Thanks to the woman with dark curly hair, I will most likely never come back to this restaurant again. I regret leaving her a decent tip as she really did not deserve much of a tip at all."
Harsha G.,"San Jose, CA",531,562,1332,5.0,11/25/2009,"If this cheesecake factory was next door, i would've to workout the whole day! red velvet cheesecake, chocolate raspberry truffle,caramel pecan turtle cheesecake,tiramisu cheesecake are my favorites!"
G E.,"Redwood City, CA",24,23,,5.0,12/9/2012,"A dozen or so of us marched into Cheesecake Factory last month (with a reservation, of course) and were greeted with a smile as we paraded in - we were all dressed in black.  (We belong to a women's organization, LOTH, aka Ladies of the Hat).  We were graciously served by an excellent waiter, and I do wish I had taken his name.  We asked for separate checks, but well ... it just couldn't be done, even though he double checked for us and did his best. After our meals, we forged on to dessert.  OMG!  We left satisfied and happy.  We're all long of tooth (over 60) and despite the reputation of old ladies always complaining, we didn't have one.  The receptionist took our pictures when we asked and seemed to enjoy our company.  We enjoyed yours, too!  Thanks for a fun experience.  We'll be back!"
Derek S.,"Concord, CA",1969,156,53,3.0,10/3/2011,"Well I think it's OK, I don't know if it's quite A-OK!  Started off at the bar, while waiting for birthday guests to arrive.  Their mojito's are great, I've tried them at a number of places, and for some reason they shine on these and their bar in general. Also, it always makes my happy seeing FAT TIRE on tap.  Bartenders were attentive and I got everything fast!  Now moving on to the dinner, once we got things rolling, the bread and water came out fast but no straws. I always think it's funny when places withhold straws or ice, iono, seems to be a growing tread.  I went with one of my usuals, orange chicken, which was good. Big portions, same good sauce, and a giant coke. Service was so-so at times hard to get the servers attention, and with 18% gratuity, I want some stealer service, that's just me.  My food was good, but for those that know my best friend Daniel, his foods usually gets messed up, usually they forget something, or don't listen. So he got the fillet mignon which is something I usually would get. It was well done and very dry, and came with a nice side of cold broccoli. So they brought out new dishing which were perfect, but no discount.  Like some places like this, when comping a meal or giving a discount isn't a big deal, they should, especially when your in downtown palo alto surrounded by much better places to eat. I'm sure if we asked they would have, but who likes to do that."
Elijah W.,"Newark, CA",244,131,27,2.0,6/13/2011,"I want to like you. I swear I do. Cool digs....fly waitresses. But compared to ya counterparts in other cities (Cambridge, MA; SF, CA to name a few), you're just not cutting it. Maybe it's the food? I've had a few dishes: Crab cakes - Usually its one of my favorite appetizers; but I wasn't feeling the ones here so much. Lightweight dried out, one of them was burned, and our waitress that night had a fat band aid around her finger..and it totally blended in with crab cakes. I was thinking: ""DAMN GINA! It's like I'm eating her fingers...can we sue for that?"" LOL. Chicken Madeira - You ever read something off the menu, ask the waiter, ""What do you think about the ________?""he almost bursts in his pants telling you how amazed your pallet will be from this culinary masterpiece, and then as soon as you get it, you look at it weird, taste and think ""Fail""? You have? Cool! Chicken Picatta - You ever read something off the menu, ask the waiter ""what do you think about the ________?"", he almost soils himself in excitement telling you how great it tastes and how it'll be a party in your mouth (TWSS), and then as soon as you get it, you look and think ""Fail"" ? You have? Slap yourself 'cuz this ain't the case. This was actually pretty damn good! Well at least the chicken was. The sauce wasn't hella rich and overbearing and the mashed potatoes that came with it were maddd good, not hella salty, just right. Herb Crusted Filet of Salmon - See ""Chicken Picatta"", replace all instances with of the word ""Chicken"" with ""Fish""...annnd then for good measure, slap yourself again. I mean the prices ain't bad though, and the service is great! But I've had better eats at the other CF joints around the way...hell, even the BK that used to be in PA that had BLT's that were OMG so damn g-dubba'O-d good! ummm, yeahhh! It is what it is though. LOL. Oh! and I would've thrown in an extra star for the cheesecake, but how would I know when all these fat wolves eat my cheesecake before I get a chance to taste it. HAHAHAH. Next time, I go alone! LOL...or at least bring a random girly sweater and place it across from me and pretend she's in the restroom. Who eats alone anymore? #CreepySon! LOL Done!"
A M.,"West Lafayette, IN",845,1249,8,5.0,4/23/2011,"Well, I have to upgrade them to 5 stars now, because my fiance proposed to me here on Friday night!  This Cheesecake Factory has played a special part in our relationship, as the site of one of our first dates and a place we went on weekly dates the first summer of our relationship.  My fiance chose this place because of its sentimental value for us, and the staff could not have been nicer or done more to make our day special.  My fiance borrowed a camera from a friend, because he knew I wanted photos of the special moment.  Before he proposed he snuck off and asked a waitress to take some pics of us, and she got some great shots.  The entire staff was so sweet about congratulating us, and at the end of our meal the manager came over, congratulated us and told us that our meal was on the house because we had a wedding to save for.   What a sweet gesture!  Thank you Cheesecake Factory Palo Alto for making one of the best nights of my life even better! Update: 6/13/2011 - they have an amazing happy hour here 4-6 pm M-F with essentially all their appetizers for $5.  We came tonight & shared the factory nachos with guac (huuuuge!), the fried mac and cheese balls (a fave of ours), and the southern fried chicken sliders (another fave).  Both of us were stuffed and we had quite a bit of leftovers to bring home - all for less than $20 including tax & tip.   Happy hours here will definitely become a regular occurrence! (Best ___: Best Happy Hour)"
Susanna W.,"Palo Alto, CA",244,639,74,3.0,3/15/2012,"I like Cheesecake Factory, even though snobbier folk (J, I'm looking at you!) might turn their noses on a chain restaurant that churns out super high calorie eats.  AMBIANCE: Typical CF.  I do NOT like how its SO DIM inside!  Please, can you turn up the lighting maybe one or two notches?!  I get sleepy inside. SERVICE: Friendly. Yep. Nothing special to add.  Sometimes the staff look like they want to punch someone in the face, but most of the time everything is fine. FOOD: Everything is super rich, so don't come here if you're on a diet.  There are some lower calorie options, but its slim pickings (pun intended? hah).  Otherwise, there should be something on the menu for everyone-- its very eclectic, and typical Cheesecake Factory fare. OVERALL: It gets the job done.  Expect to spend around $20/person for shared apps and entrees."
John T.,"Greer, SC",2,16,,2.0,12/17/2011,"The food: excellent. The deserts: excellent. The service: awful. I was completely satisfied with the food. It was everything one would expect from a Cheesecake Factory. The food is overpriced, but only if you look at it as being one meal. However, consider the dishes as being two meals, and it is actually affordable. I had the Chicken Bellagio and it easily was plenty for dinner and the next day's lunch. The cheesecake is expensive (my Red Velvet Cheesecake was $8 for one slice) but it is worth splurging for the experience once or twice a year. The service at this location was just terrible. My server COMPLETELY ignored me. I spent a very long time looking over the menu, with no sign of my server coming to check up on me. I then finished the menu, placed it across the table, and began checking Facebook on my phone. It was still another 5 or 10 minutes before the server came to take my order, and this was while sitting RIGHT BY the order entry computer that almost always had an employee standing at it. No one noticed me at all. Once the food finally came, the performance was repeated. I sat with my finished plate across the table from me for 10 minutes or more before someone noticed me. At this point, I was just waiting to see how long it would actually take, because the length of time was actually rather comical. So, go for the food if you must, but beware of the awful service!!"
Samantha M.,"Potrero Hill, San Francisco, CA",0,10,,1.0,12/26/2014,"Worst service ever! The host said that we can seat ourselves, so we did, but then 20 minutes later, another waitress comes and says that we need to leave and put our name on the list. Their service is so confusing! Also, the food isn't that good."
Shilly W.,"Fremont, CA",4,30,14,4.0,10/28/2013,"Went there this past weekend and fell in LOVE with the chicken/portebello mushroom with mashed potatoes dish. Don't know what it's called but it's one of the most popular items listed on the menu. It was just fantastic. Delicious sauce, tender, NOT dry chicken, and creamy mashed potatoes sent from above. Don't know about the other items on the menu but I would definitely choose this dish again. Lack one star because it's just a tad bit expensive but since it's so good, I'd come back for more."
bruce k.,"Palo Alto, CA",2,84,,4.0,8/21/2012,"I am not much of a fan of Cheesecake the food, but I am definitely a fan of the Cheesecake Factory. I usually do not like chains so much, but after a few times of going to the Cheesecake Factory when nothing else was around I stopped taking this chain for granted.  They do a dang good job! I realized I have never really gotten anything bad in this place.  The worst thing I can say about it is that it is crowded and loud sometimes, but the food is dependable and good, above par for most chain restaurants and the service is above average - not perfect but very good . The Seared Tuna Salad is my favorite, and I don't do dessert much anymore, but the Strawberry Shortcake is amazing.  I once got some fried egg roll kind of things with avocado in them, which tasted OK, but they had so much oil in them they were swimming with it ...  a bit too much. One other thing that I appreciate more and more in life as time goes on is that they restroom was clean, quiet and sanitary. Thank for Cheesecake Factory for being dependable and having a good Seared Tuna Salad and Strawberry Shortcake ... and I am not kidding about the Strawberry Shortcake ... it's perfect for 2 or maybe even three people! ;-)"
Dean D.,"Fremont, CA",379,65,5,5.0,8/1/2014,"They catered for us. Friendly waitstaff. Greek salad, chicken, jambalaya, and arugula salad were great."
Bubu B.,"California City, CA",0,15,,5.0,5/30/2015,"This is the best food among all the cheesecake I have been to.  Really surprised they can delivery such good quality food. The sevice was nice too although often busy but they have good attitude. Tomato basil pasta, cuban sandwhich, and of course their signature dark bread are must. Give it a try here. You'll see ccf differently."
Daniel D.,"Concord, CA",827,462,315,2.0,10/5/2011,"I've never been to this area for dinner. It sure was busy on a Saturday night around 7ish. B -- S -- Parking?! what parking? oh the garage? good luck! -- 20+ birthday party (we did get priority seating took 20 mins) -- Bar area is quick and attentive -- Mojitos = Yum -- Manager checked in with our table -- Service was decent -- My order was all messed up We had a huge party for a friend's birthday so I anticipated waiting a while but suprisingly we didn't wait too long. I knew it was going to be a long night since we had so much food but little did I know that this place was going to drop the ball on something simple like a steak. It all started with no lemon for my water so I had to ask a few times. Did I get refills on my water? Nope, I drank someone else's.  My Order: Filet mignon with mashed potatoes and broccoli. My steak was severely overcooked to well done and my broccoli was cold. Our server brought out some fresh broccoli but the steak took about 25 minutes to get one medium well. By that time everyone had basically finished their food.  I've experienced such better service and execution at my local cheesecake factory that I probably won't be back to this location. I do give them a slight break because we had such a large group but I would think that my server would have noticed the steak over cooked before he served it. In addition there was no compensation for the mistake or the wait and both of the servers were handed 18% as a tip. Another flaw in the restaurant industry! We give you 18% guaranteed and the service can be lackluster or even horrible."
Mary G.,"Fremont, CA",0,33,,3.0,7/24/2015,Portions for pasta are huge enough for 2-3 people. Cheesecakes are too sweet. Most of the time i don't bother eating here since wait time are usually more than 45 min.
Dana R.,"Sunnyvale, CA",3,26,,5.0,12/13/2013,"What can I say? This place is great for a large group, because you can order ANYTHING - the menu is huge! The food is tasty and fresh, and everybody in my party was happy. Even the desserts were great, and I did not even have a cheesecake (not a big fan of that dessert in general). Sure - it's not gourmet food, but it certainly hits the spot, and I appreciated the great selection, which makes it a great place for a big family or friends gathering."
Pat S.,"San Mateo, CA",0,34,,3.0,12/31/2014,"Went to Cheesecake Factory in Palo Alto last night. Our waiter was great and our entrees and deserts (cheesecake and an Oreo milk shake) were pretty good,  but the coffee was really awful, especially the decaf.  I don't know what brand of coffee this place uses. What ever it is, it is time for a change. There is no excuse for a lousy cup of coffee."
Kathy L.,"Orange County, CA",69,1139,1515,3.0,8/16/2011,"Large menu with a wide variety of options, both food and drink. Several ""healthy"" options if you're on a diet or watching calories, but unfortunately no whole wheat option for pasta. Attentive and polite service. Evelyn's Favorite Pasta is a good, sauceless penne pasta with sundried tomatoes, artichoke, and eggplant. Everyone's plate at my table of 13 looked tasty, so seems like this isn't one of those chains that boasts a large menu but nothing is good. And of course if you aren't watching your weight, a slice of one of their cheesecakes is a must!"
