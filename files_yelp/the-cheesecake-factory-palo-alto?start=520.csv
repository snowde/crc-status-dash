Olga B.,"San Bruno, CA",315,249,893,5.0,12/27/2012,"The best CF I've ever been to! Best service and ambiance! Favorite choices: steaks, Turkey Burger and Angel Hair Pasta with shrimps and of course CHEESECAKES!"
Tania M.,"Mountain View, CA",187,26,7,1.0,9/19/2013,"I had the Chicken Marsala and it was horrible! The sauce tasted like fish -- nothing like the traditional sauce and it was WAY over priced. The quantity of the food was generous, but didn't help because I couldn't eat it!"
Laura Z.,"Palo Alto, CA",0,10,,2.0,11/5/2013,"Cheescake Factory is so-so to me in general, but I know what I'm getting, and that's a personal preference. My rating is based on the performance of this location. Overall, I think this is a decent location. I've had issues with slow service and mistakes in my order, but they always make it right in the end.  My big problem with this place is that they keep it so ridiculously dark in the evenings. You can barely see the person you're with, and forget about seeing your food. Last time I was there I had a dish with 2 dipping sauces and I couldn't see which was which.  You know it's getting absurd when your ""mood lighting"" actually interferes with customer's ability to even eat their food."
B B.,"Redwood City, CA",0,4,,3.0,1/3/2015,"Not impressed.  Things started out ok but we ended up leaving pissed off due to lack of attentiveness from our server.  Luckily one of the other servers saw us sitting there and finally came to the rescue and completed service for us in less than 3 minutes.  Our server came back like omg he already took care of you?  Uh duh dingbat...do u think we like sitting here with our thumbs up our asses? She was lucky we didn't get the manager.  Food was ok.  Nothing to rave about.  Cheesecake is half the size it used to be but of course the same price.  2 people, $90 dinner...I expect much better."
Jocelyn V.,"San Francisco, CA",156,13,9,4.0,8/12/2010,I LOVE THE AMBIANCE!!! umm... Food was... Mediocore.. Nothing to scream or brag about.. I took half of my dish home.

Jen Y.,"Mountain View, CA",35,242,89,1.0,6/7/2011,"It seems so obvious and pointless to say that Cheesecake Factory is not a great restaurant, but even though I went with low expectations for the food last night (for a friend's annual birthday dinner), the service managed to be even worse. What's the opposite of out-shine? Out-suck? Yes that sounds right. The service out-sucked the food. Slow, shoddy, disoriented, confused, and useless service from the staff as well as the manager, and no attempt to resolve issues even when we complained, and they still added a big fat tip on our group's tab. Ugh."
Mark M.,"Mountain View, CA",70,19,,5.0,5/20/2012,"We went to Cheesecake tonight for my Mom's birthday. The group was me, my wife, my Mom, my almost-3 year old son, and our newborn in a stroller. We haven't eaten at this location before. We arrived around 6:20 for dinner on a Sunday night and were promptly seated. After taking our order, our server -- unprompted -- brought out a special plate of bread and sliced bananas for our almost-3 year old to munch on. Outstanding! The bread, especially the dark break, is, as always, delicious and easy to fill up on before your main course. We were saving room for dessert so skipped any appetizers. For dinner, my wife, mom and I all had combination plates with the Steak Diane and seafood. My wife and mom had Shrimp Scampi, I had herb crusted salmon with a white wine sauce. We all really enjoyed the steak -- which was wonderfully moist and tender, and the sweet wine sauce with mushrooms really were fantastic. My salmon was delicious and perfectly cooked, and we all remarked that the mashed potatoes were superb. My son enjoyed his chicken fingers, which were crisp but not greasy and made with high quality white meat. He enjoyed the ranch and the honey mustard sauce. The sliced fruit that accompanied it was a fresh and delicious mix of apples, pineapple, pear, orange, and strawberry. For dessert, my mom and wife said were the best Tiramisu they'd ever enjoyed (and we've had some pretty good ones in Tuscany a few years ago). Perfectly balanced flavors and sponginess. We also shared a slice of the chocolate truffle cake, which was really amazing. The chocolate was dark enough to satisfy me (I love dark chocolate) but not so dark as to shock my wife's palate, and it somehow managed to stay perfectly rich but not overpowering. The ice cream and whipped cream that came with it helped take just enough of the edge off. My son even had a few bites and didn't find it overpowering. Quite remarkable that we were all delighted by the dessert, even though we have slightly different palates. Also, a special thank you to the staff who when told we were there for my Mom's birthday brought the Tiramisu out with a candle and a special Happy birthday message, then they proceeded to serenade her with a Happy Birthday song. Thank you! The grand ceilings and decor made this a really fun special occasion restaurant. The service was efficient, kept our water cups and bread basket full, and was fast with the dessert delivery and the check. The price/value was excellent, considering the quality and quantity of the food we enjoyed.  We haven't been in a while. But this experience ensured that we'll be going back again before too long! The menu is huge and we were really impressed with the quality of the food. We'll definitely be back to explore it further."
Ada L.,"Union City, CA",5,69,53,3.0,8/30/2012,"We came here during Palo Alto Fine Art Festival last Sunday.  There's no wait at all during lunch hour. In fact, the restaurant was half-empty.  We ordered the rib-eye and a luau salad.  The beef is very juicy and tasty, however, it's a rather small portion for a price tag of $25.  The luau salad is my all time favorite... delicious as always.  The waitress was attentive and refilled our bread/water w/o asking.  Overall pricey but good quality."
Mike M.,"Belmont, CA",111,451,909,5.0,1/15/2012,"Came here for some quick dessert on Saturday with a friend after the 49er vs Saints game and I was pleasantly surprised at how nice the location was relative to the others I've been to (San Mateo and Las Vegas).  Service was great as usual, of course the low carb cheesecake was to die for, and the layout was really nice, plus enjoyed the outdoor seating.  Looking forward to re-visit next time I'm in the area."
Jackson L.,"San Jose, CA",103,653,1478,2.0,7/19/2011,"I generally like The Cheesecake Factory chain as a whole. Like another reviewer stated, I know their meals are calorie-dense, but they are quite tasty and they have a huge menu. However, I have had some pretty disappointing experiences at the Palo Alto location. During my past couple of visits, I have received raw chicken, spoiled avocado and very mediocre french fries.  The service has also been subpar. It is often extremely slow, the waitstaff seems uninterested, and I often receive the wrong thing. They act as though you are inconveniencing them by sending stuff back that they screwed up on. Overall, don't bother. This location does not meet up to The Cheesecake Factory's standards."
Jessica P.,"Menlo Park, CA",0,314,,2.0,5/21/2015,The crab cakes were tasty but the salad are just very ordinary and have no real taste to rave about. Even the bread was hard and not soft sour dough. It is very basic American food and wish they would come up with a better menu with more seafood options.
Tako B.,"Palo Alto, CA",1,34,1,3.0,5/27/2012,Solidly an average restaurant. Cheesecake factory has a fairly consistent experience as far as their locations go. I go here every so often because it's one of the few places that are open late. Service is good sometimes and sometimes you don't know where your server is but another server or the manager are often helpful. Most of the food is really salty and I have to drink 3 glasses of water. The portions are usually really big and I have to pack the stuff Togo. Cheesecake is good and most the food isnt bad despite the saltiness. I would recommend the peanut butter honey shake that one is really good.  So would I recommend this place? Probably not but it isn't a bad choice. It's just the same as all the other locations.
Kenneth Y.,"Tampa, FL",2,6,,1.0,4/29/2011,"My wife and I just tried to have dinner there. We were promptly seated and then no one came by our table for 10 minutes!!! UNEXCUSEABLE !!! The sole job af the host/hostess is to greet, seat and tell the waitperson that a guest has been seated. I never saw the host/hostess do this last critical step for any of guests that came in after us. The management clearly does not know how to properly run a resturant to prevent these type of gaffs. The owner needs to fire the person in charge and hire a better person. They lost the $70 we would have dropped there tonight and our future business. Service is the #1 quality we judge a resturant on and they failed miserably!"
Hana H.,"Tacoma, WA",0,19,36,1.0,10/26/2014,"Worst service! No one was waiting in the entrance area, yet we still waited 30 minutes. After getting seated, we didn't get water or bread until 10 minutes later. Then our food came out 40 minutes after that (despite ordering as soon as we sat down). Apparently they were having issues all day with the ""system being down"" so they had to manually write down orders. Too bad the 2 groups seated after us got served before we did. Worst experience at a Cheesecake Factory."
Jamie G.,"Palo Alto, CA",0,5,,5.0,5/29/2015,The cheesecake Factory is my favorite place to eat. My boyfriend and I go to this place all the time lol For the past several years I have ordered the same thing Spicy Chicken Chiptole Pasta. Love this place and encourage everyone to eat here
Rosa C.,"Antioch, CA",0,7,,1.0,5/22/2011,"Back in early April 2,  2011, I took my son for his b-day dinner, and when his dish was brought to him, he mentioned that tasted kind of salty, I suggested to him to ask the waiter about it. At the same time my cousin and I tried his seafood pasta dish, and what a surprise of the amount of salt that was added to it! When the waiter came over, my son ask him about it. Soon after the manager on duty came over, and he said that this dish is prepared with this huge amount of salt, that we didn't know better.  I must say that what a very poor way to go about this issue, without him verify and mend the issue with the cook. Well, my son was offered to order a similar dish, and he decided to order prawns fettuccine, and this time wasn't salted as the original dish was.  The only bad thing that I see in here is how the Manager handled this situation in a niece restaurant as The Cheese Factory chain is. I hope no one runs in a situation like the one my son and I went through."
Jenna L.,"Milpitas, CA",485,488,74,5.0,1/9/2012,"Cheesecake Factory to me has the same customer service, same honey wheat bread, has the same look and feel that I'm use to. I feel like I'm at home.. or close to home, since there's none in Milpitas per se. Hehehe. ANYWHO ONWARD - So the bfan and I shared the Gumbo entree together. It was sooo good!!! I never had Gumbo before, so I wasn't sure what to expect. The soup base is amazingly good. Mouthwatering really. We split the dish and they gave us an extra plate :) They did not charge a $12 splitting fee.. (unlike bayou in disneyland.. what a rip off)  The bread was good and she knew I like it and got 2 more loaves for us. WOOHOO! I ordered a Mango Daquiri and was quite pleased."
Jennifer G.H. W.,"San Jose, CA",455,837,1983,4.0,11/5/2010,"I met up with a friend that I havn't talked to for awhile and we decided to meet at Cheesecake Factory. It's always good to catch up with old friends that you've lost touch with because of our busy lives in the Bay area. :O) We had the crab wontons, fried artichoke hearts, steak diane, and the luau salad. First time trying the fried artichoke hearts and the luau salad. They were pretty good. Of course, I had to have the Asian pear martini. Absolutely yummy! :O)"
Katrina A.,"South San Francisco, CA",449,23,2,1.0,3/29/2011,"Since my family and I were in the area, we thought we should this one. Hated it!! The customer service was so bad! The waiter did not even check on us while my family and I were eating! My family and I also had to wait more than 30 minutes to get the check! By the time we left,the restaurant was about to close... I will never go to this cheesecake factory. I'd rather go to the one in San Francisco."
Alice L.,"Elk Grove, CA",201,140,40,4.0,2/14/2011,"the best experience I've ever had at the cheesecake factory was here. Usually the servers aren't really attentive at the Cheesecake Factory but our server was constantly coming back to check on us, he came back 3 times asking if we're ready to order (I have a hard time deciding sometimes..) & didn't give us any attitude (when usually servers get annoyed after the second time). The great service might have been the fact that the bf & I came in at 11 for a late night dinner after he got off work but it was still pretty packed either way.   the food was also very delicious. the boyfriend got the spicy crispy chicken sandwich & I got the cuban sandwich, both verryyy good but his was definitely better than mine.."
