Sophers M.,"Palo Alto, CA",0,32,,4.0,4/4/2014,"I love the artichokes here, as well as the bread and salads. I've never had a bad experience here, but the food isn't exactly revolutionary and the prices are a bit steep. The cheesecake is lovely though."
Henry N.,"San Diego, CA",0,15,,4.0,3/31/2014,Just had dinner there last night .... The service was great. The staff was so accommodating and friendly. They did everything they could to make our dinner a great experience
Charlene C.,"San Jose, CA",304,667,229,5.0,8/7/2011,"Took a friend here for dinner with the baby Found parking across the street on university ave in Palo Alto Hostess and waittress were very accommodating, sweet and efficient We ordered: Arnold Palmer (half iced tea and half lemonade) Avocado Egg Rolls Shrimp Franchese Caramel Chicken Bread, water and the drinks were served immediately. The avocado egg rolls were delicious, crispy on the outside  Tender on the inside with a wonderful sweet, pestoey dipping sauce The friend LOVED the large shrimp and butter sauce on his al dente pasta.  They literally shaved a truckload of parmesan cheese on his pasta which was magnifique My caramel chicken was too DIE FOR. Think tender chicken in a vietnamese seasoned sauce with caramelized onions, roasted red peppers. I requested non spicy and they accommodated my request. Normally they use green beans, but I am not a green bean fan, so they subbed the beans with peppers. Excellent choice. And wonderful aroma. They use standard long grain white rice.  For desserts: We ordered the chocolate truffle tower cake I ordered the Red velvet cheesecake with whipped cream We were so full, both wonderfully, rich, delicious desserts were brough home. All in all with the excellent service, nice conversation and excellent food, we left very happy and fulfilled. Meal total $76.00 plus a 17.00 tip"
Katie Anne N.,"San Francisco, CA",631,1335,908,3.0,9/12/2011,"Date and I stopped by for dessert. We ordered the Kahlua cheesecake and boy, was it decadent. I totally get how mainstream and touristy CF can be, but their desserts have never let me down. Wash it down with a beer and you're good to go."
Nancy L.,"Carlsbad, CA",283,400,663,3.0,9/3/2011,"This CF would have been down to two stars for the slow service, but their complimentary ""Baby Plate"", thinner slices of their bread and some rounds of bananas, saved the day.  Because my niece is so extremely cute, she also scored a bowl of strawberries and bananas later on.  My sister would probably disagree, but it's so easy to eat out with kids nowadays!"
Mike B.,"Foster City, CA",0,47,1,2.0,2/29/2012,"We had dinner here a few days ago.  I have been coming to cheesecake factory for a lot of years, other locations though. I always liked cheesecake factory not only for cheesecakes but for food as well.  Food has always been on an expensive side but really outstanding quality. This visit, however, I was not impressed with the food.  Pasta was good but not outstanding, burger was ok, nothing spectacular, salad was ok. However, I was really turned off by the prices.  Chicken pasta - $17.  Burger - $11.50 - that is way overpriced for a burger that is nothing special. Cheesecake was as good as ever but $7.95 -  a bit overpriced in my book.  Service was terrible.  Every time we needed our waiter - we would have to seek him out.  Usually he was either watching TV near the bar or chatting with other waiters. For these kind of prices I believe one deserves better service. All-in-all I would probably not come here again"
Betty O.,"Redwood City, CA",0,11,,4.0,9/23/2012,"Paul. Our waiter made it fun, food was real good, grilled artichokes were amazing  Thank You paul for making our dinner special and giving us great service in Palo Alto"
Lindsey A.,"San Jose, CA",143,455,22,2.0,7/4/2013,"There was a time in my life that Cheesecake Factory was a good family option for dinner. However, since my kids were born, it's in no way worth it. The menu is still giant, but the food options have dropped dramatically in quality. Yes, they get a lot of bad press for their unhealthy options, but even their ""healthy"" options now suck! My husband and I had a gift certificate to use up, so we stopped by after a morning at a spa here. We both ordered salads. They sure lived up to their claim to fame of being giant, but this salad had a tiny amount of everything except for lettuce. I think there was a head and a half of lettuce in there! It was fine enough, but at a point I felt like a cow eating grass-- there was an ENDLESS amount of lettuce! I would give it +1 point for it's location along University, which is nice, and for their outdoor seating, although sparse."
Christopher R.,"San Francisco, CA",0,21,,2.0,3/18/2012,"I was referred to check out the Cheescake Factory ( ) in San Mateo and obliged. I always thought a rub could be better than the sauced wings. I was excited to see them come rubbed. The first half of the order was good, but after a while the saltiness gets overpowering. And they give you enough bleu cheese for about 3 wings. They're ok. Good crisp since they are rubbed, but I don't want more."
Jeff B.,"Oakland, CA",116,56,46,4.0,10/31/2011,"Wow, what a variety of reviews. I have been here a hand full of times recently and never had a terrible experience. In fact, the last time they provided excellent customer service. We ordered stuffed tortillas, but they ran out of the mix for the corn cakes. The runner acted like everything was okay and we had to show them on the menu what we are talking about. The server came over and apologized. We negotiated with her for what we wanted in return, the manager came out and we decided on a fair exchange. Low and behold, they even went an extra step and hooked it up. So why no 5 starts? Well first of all they have some problems with their service. The cooks are not communicating to the staff what they have and don't have. Second, the runners have no clue what is on the menu. There are a lot of items, and it doesn't seem like the runners eventually become servers, so whatever. My biggest qualm is the time it takes to get an alcoholic beverage. One little bar, one bartender = takes forever. Probably the stupid mojitos. I haven't met a bartender that enjoys making them. Too much work! For the people that ordered steaks and they were overcooked, who orders a Filet Mignon at the Cheesecake Factory? Really! Go to a steak house if you are going to order the most expensive cut of beef. Just saying."
Melissa E.,"San Francisco, CA",484,33,,1.0,8/20/2012,"This review is based on an experience during cold and flu season.  The food was okay, but the service and sanitation should be worked on.  The sick employees should not cough, sneeze, and wipe their noses and then touch the napkins and the heads of the utensils while putting together the table settings.  If they have to cough, sneeze, nose wipe, etc., then please have them wash their hands and/or surfaces before going back to their task.  This should happen with all employees all year round.  Thanks."
Ann V.,"Lathrop, CA",50,45,4,3.0,6/16/2013,Can't go wrong with Cheesecake Factory. Food is always good but the customer service is hit and miss so only 3 stars.
Dominik R.,"Palo Alto, CA",7,12,,5.0,2/18/2012,"They offer quite a wide selection of non-cheesecake food. I've been there around 10 times. I've had their salads, burgers, pasta, chicken, and deserts, and everything I tried so far was really good,. The inside looks really nice, and the service is quite good. One of my favorite places in Palo Alto."
deepa n.,"Sunnyvale, CA",8,8,1,3.0,1/25/2015,"More  a 2.5 , there was party of 20 and our service so slow and needed a lot of prompting as if like we are eating for free"
Shmoopy P.,"Palo Alto, CA",1,8,,2.0,2/15/2015,Pizza definitely microwaved. Cheesecake good but expensive. Many forks. Not enough knives. Cheap when it comes to lighting. Cheese to carrot ratio is not great in cake. They also sell carrot cake.
Mary T.,"Hayward, CA",94,248,205,3.0,5/23/2011,"Came here last night for dinner with a friend, wait was only 15 minutes for a Sunday night, around 7PM.  Not too bad!  Service was prompt and we had a Russian waitress named ""Natalia,"" who was super nice and friendly, which is always a plus.   Food was legit, just like all the other Cheesecake factory locations.  Although, I will have you know, the best Cheesecake Factory is the one in egas at Caesar's.  Not sure what it is, but man, their food is 10X better and the service is for sure on point.  Maybe cause it's Vegas they want to cater to folks that are traveling to be there.   I like their California Cheesesteak (mines: with no cheese and no peppers, please)  I know right, then it's not a Cheesesteak is what people always tell me.  I'm just picky and don't like cheese.   I also enjoy their pulled pork sandwich, salmon herb crusted salad, bistro shrimp pasta (too bad this dish is like one of the worst pasta dishes you can EVER eat in your life), and the buffalo wings with sauce on the side.  For drinks, try their mango daiquiri... really good!  Dessert, I'm not a big cheesecake fan, but def. when there, I get a slice of the Linda's fudge cake along with maybe 2-3 scoops of coffee ice cream to go along with.  Yum-O!  Enjoy!"
Jessica C.,"San Francisco, CA",432,267,1061,4.0,9/6/2010,i go crazy for craig's crazy carrot cake cheesecake!!! you cannot go wrong here because everything is fattening. cheesecake factory has the typical universal foods that everybody likes. p.s. they are still the maker of my favorite sweet potato fries ever.
Aude B.,"Boulogne-Billancourt, France",16,14,7,3.0,3/2/2011,"The menu is correct. I had a big fresh and healthy salad. The cheesecake is very good, but you have to take the original one.  The cake with pecan and caramel is way too heavy and too sugared. The original is very simple, very good. Unless you're Gigantor, order it with 2 spoons for sharing !"
Nhung T.,"Oakland, CA",208,773,,4.0,12/18/2010,"Their happy hour menu upgraded, had a couple of good dishes I wanted to mentioned. I would definitely order the chicken dumpling (sauce was excelllent) and buffalo delight ( I think that was the name, it was basically stuffed boneless buffalo chicken, I truly enjoyed it). My favorite cheesecake was the white raspberry truffle."
K B.,"Palo Alto, CA",1,32,,4.0,2/23/2013,"We passed on the Cheesecake Factory for years because we didn't like the idea of a big chain on Univ Ave and we assumed it would be bad. (Don't ask.) But the restaurant we were headed to had a long wait and we were hungry. There is a ""light"" menu that had terrific food choices: vegetarian, crispy, fresh, lightly seasoned and delicious. My son's burger & fries were excellent. Service was fast & friendly. Moreover, we pay so much money for a meal out in Palo Alto, and this mightily tasty meal was SO CHEAP relative to other restaurants we frequent. Darn you, Cheesecake Factory."
