Andrew C.,"Palo Alto, CA",1,41,,2.0,1/23/2012,"PROS -  - Great cheesecakes and dessert menu. - Menu has a great selection of various foods. - Decent decor. CONS - - Waiters / chefs can't seem to get the orders correct. The last THREE visits to this restaurant, the food was not as I requested. Ingredients that were supposed to be left off, were on the meals I ordered. - Staff needs to be more attentive to customer needs. Great place for desserts!!"
Mike G.,"Atherton, CA",0,6,,2.0,10/13/2010,"Once upon a time in a galaxy far far away, a family of 4 went to Cheesecake Factory for dinner. All 4 people got their food at the same time when one of the members noticed that his burnt to a crisp patty was being hidden under the bun of his hamburger.  He knew he couldn't digest a hockey puck and asked for a well-done meat patty like he had originally ordered.  All 3 other members finished their meals and had their plates taken away, while the 4th member of the family got to stare at a hamburger bun to satsify his hungry appetite.  Time went by and his mysterious patty was ""almost done"" and the restaurant's manager insisted that there was no reason to feel awakward watching 1 member of the family eat his meal alone while the other 3 had finished.  The entire family eventually asked 3 times politely to just remove the item from their bill and 1 time in a very stern manner for them to not get charged for an item they had not received.  Overrall the food was decent, service was so-so. Said family will probably not come back unless they are a hockey puck hamburger especial."
Vy N.,"Livermore, CA",82,21,4,2.0,10/25/2010,"Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite places to eat, but this location was disappointing.   We ordered the fried macaroni and cheese, which we order all the time.  It turned out so badly, with a bitter aftertaste.  We told our waiter and he took care of it.  We ordered another appetizer and thought we wouldn't have to pay for it for it but we did.  Later that night, I had a stomach ache.  I'm pretty sure it was due to the fried mac 'n cheese balls. Other than that,  the main dishes and cheesecakes were delicious, as usual.  2 stars because I got sick."
Yu B.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,1,,5.0,1/6/2015,"The place is just so good! It has a convenient location in palo alto downtown, with plenty of delicious main dishes. Cheesecakes are excellent desserts after meal!"
Eva L.,"Madison, WI",70,72,,2.0,3/19/2011,"I really wanted to rate it A-ok, but after having a horrible experience, I just couldn't click on that extra * . Of course, no one else is going to experience this.. but still--it just reminded me why I cringe when someone mentions Cheesecake Factory. After being seated, the waiter brought water and practically dropped his tray right in front of me (thank goodness it didn't roll at me, but my silverware flew and almost attacked my friend). ok ok. so s**t happens. 2 people ordered regular menu items and the food came fine. I ordered from their brunch menu Eggs Benedict with bacon and spinach, while my friend ordered the Giant Belgian Waffle with Strawberries, Pecans and Chantilly Cream. His waffles arrive and I definitely knew we were in a recession. There were no pecans, maybe 2 strawberries sliced (max), and no cream. It looked pathetic because I knew a time when I would drool when he ordered it. We had the waiter take it back and add pecans and a drizzle of cream.  Then my dish came... ok, I don't eat at Cheesecake Factory much so I was eating mine and thinking.. ok I know I ordered Eggs Benedict, but I ordered the other one that said it was available with Ham and Hollandaise with Fresh Spinach, Bacon and Grilled Tomato with no mention of eggs (I admit.. I was going through a clueless moment). I got up, found our waiter and asked him, ""your Eggs Benedict doesn't come with eggs??"" with sincerity because maybe I'm the idiot that ordered the wrong thing. He took it back and had another made, the muffin came out cold, the eggs were cold (most likely the ones that didn't make it on my plate), the stacking order changed significantly.  Did the normal Sunday crew not show up? It wasn't even busy. So much for ruining my diet.. so not worth it! The saving grace was when the manager came by, apologized and took care of my bill. Hence saving it from a one * experience."
Ray W.,"Dublin, CA",106,288,,2.0,6/6/2011,"The Good:  Large portions, extensive menu, beautifully done restaurant The Bad: Advertising in your menu?  what the?  Dirty Bathroom, don't take reservations on the weekends So I went there last week to see if this spot has gotten any better.  Drinks at the bar, no issues ~ although, they are lacking in the rum department. No decent rums. What gives? Anyways, seated promptly although they didn't take my reservation on the phone, I ended up having to go to the restaurant 20 minutes early to ensure my seating.   Food was okay at best.  Had the guac, which was okay and also had the lettuce wraps, which I think was okay even though they used butter lettuce vs. iceberg like everyone else.  The sauce for the wraps was good.   Gross thing for me though was..... Servers are forced to wear white.. Which would be fine for a clean and spotless dining establishment.. But when you have sometimes utter chaos, you can see how dirty some of these servers outfits get.  Kinda makes you not wanna eat.. Just sayin...  Clean it up folks!!!"
Marilyn M.,"San Diego, CA",0,23,,1.0,7/18/2015,"Zero stars for this place.  Worst dining experience ever.  They estimated a twenty minute wait.  Forty-five minutes later -- no update -- we asked.  They said they were just clearing our table.  Ten minutes later, we asked again.  They showed us to the table, and they left us to stand there while it was being cleared.  They took the kids orders --- two dishes to share with four kids.  They didn't bring extra plates or ask if we needed them.  We asked for straws -- and waited.  Meanwhile, we ordered our meals and waited, and waited and waited. Another forty-five minutes.  Finally, our waiter appeared and informed us that there had been a problem in the kitchen and it would take more time.  He offered no explanation, but when pressed told us that the entire order had been dropped, and they'd have to start over.  No offer to bring more bread, complimentary appetizers, or even refill our water glasses.  We waited some more.  At one point another waiter appeared asking if what he was carrying was perhaps part of our order.  it wasn't.  Finally, the food appeared.  Other than totally burnt corn cakes, it was good.  But at that point we had been there more than two and a half hours, and we had no time to actually eat the food.  We asked for boxes.  More waiting.  No one ever came by to ask us if everything was okay or if we needed anything or even to refill our water glasses.  This is no way to run a restaurant.  No service.  No apologies."
Ed N.,"South San Francisco, CA",4,111,14,2.0,8/26/2013,"We had lunch Sunday afternoon during the Street Fair. The service was real slow, at the outside tables. The food is always good and we did get to people watch."
mark a.,"Mountain View, CA",0,9,7,1.0,5/23/2010,"Went to the Palo Alto location a couple months ago, and had the worst dining experience of several questionable visits over the years and I'm compelled to write a review now. Service has always been inconsistent, and definitely not this location's strongest suit, from forgetting orders to serving other customers first to just plain negligence. I'm guessing the staff has a high turnover and/or training really needs to step up their game because any quality of service was non-existent.  This last visit we ordered the spicy ahi tempura rolls, a standard favorite of ours, but this time the dish was incredibly salty and to top it off, a piece of a wooden skewer remained in one of the pieces. The fried zucchini was not as crispy, and the other dishes we ordered lacked the usual flavor and taste we've grown accustomed to.  Do yourself a favor and stay away from this location and restaurant - there are many better choices in the Peninsula.  The best CF location we've ever been to is in Fresno, service and food was top notch. An oasis from the heat indeed."
John S.,"Fremont, CA",54,25,12,5.0,1/7/2014,"Cheesecake factory is your typical american food restaurant. It seems like their menu is endless. They have hamburgers, pastas, pizzas and obviously some mouthwatering desserts. We usually go out here in a big group and they seem to have something for everyone. They have a lot of vegetarian options for the non-meat eaters, they have fish options for the healthy protein eaters so everyone is covered, Their prices are not bad either. Their brunch options on Sundays are the best."
Barbara S.,"Santa Clara, CA",10,112,,4.0,11/6/2012,"Came here for my daughter's 21st birthday last Thursday.  At 3:30 p.m., there was practically no one there.  We got a lovely table and had a wonderful waitperson named Jamal.  He made sure our experience was the best ever.  He even brought my daughter a chocolate sundae at the end of our meal and sang Happy Birthday.  We could not be happier with our experience.  Thank you Cheesecake Factory and Jamal who made our experience special and memorable!"
Devin P.,"Menlo Park, CA",0,26,2,1.0,11/15/2012,Factory is an appropriate name for this Industrial kitchen that churns out microwaved corporate designed meals.  There are advertisements in the menu! It's McDonald's with fancy decorations.
Marie R.,"Palo Alto, CA",9,96,,1.0,2/11/2014,"I was so impressed with the atmosphere of the restaurant but all else fails a good restaurant, was surprised the manager came by and asked how things were, when mentioning that the shrimp dish was really too peppery, I was not offered another dish or a real apology only that he bragged about the yummy cheesecakes, so my boyfriend and I could not wait to try two different varieties, only to find them a bit stale, so my boyfriend asked if they were baked fresh here, and she said she too was disappointed to find that the were brought in from the factory and thawed for two days after being frozen, YUK!!!!!!!!!!!!! I had better cheesecake at smart and final, for pennies on the dollar, not to mention just finding parking was horrible, my boyfriend had to park two blocks away and it was tough as we circle around not knowing where to park. I will not ask to eat here again for sure."
Saurabh S.,"Fremont, CA",0,12,1,2.0,10/20/2011,"Had a really disappointing time at this place for dinner.  The seating (for a party of 6 was quick) however, the serve really messed up the evening.  First, it took forever to get our food (even when the place was not all that crowded). The waiter then just disappeared and didn't even bother to check for any water, desserts etc. Finally, we had ask a server on another table to help out. Our server then emerged again to take our dessert order and he messed it up again.  Even the food was average. Overall, an evening of fun turned into a total disappointment just due to carelessness of the server."
Jade T.,"CA, CA",140,285,65,2.0,1/2/2007,":[  I am downgrading the rating. All because of the virtually inedible Buffalo wings ordered in March 2007.  Over-cooked and drenched in the crappiest tabasco sauce. There was NO flavour, no spice, no tender chicken meat.  There was only hot, rubbery and stringy.  Blech. My local pizza shop serves wings a million times better than this. Original write-up below. *** Thaaaat's right... keep hatin' on the Factory. No really, please. Share UR experience about the ginormous portions, waiting and waiting, it's like any other chain place, quasi-ostentatious decor, noise, the magazine-long menu... All of this hopefully means less waiting for me, so I can get hella good eats and booze, and only the freakin' most satisfying Cheesecake in Cali! Dunno if it's Chandler&Rach-eat-off-the-floor delicious, but I think it's pretty close. Too ""much"" food??  Hel-looo... ever heard of wrap it up to take home?  Or just get a side or appetizer if U want less. ""Expensive""... what?!  Ever seen the menu at those wine bar/restaurants just a couple blocks away?  This is no worse and mostly much better pricing. Anyway, the Factory's basically giving U some two or three meals out of it for the price.  If U bother with the leftovers.  (Am I the only one who does that anymore?) Servers are cool, knowledgeable; no lousy experiences so far. afa the grub, I've never gone wrong with Filet Mignon, Martinis and Salads. Grilled Artichoke starter is usually killer too. Rock on, Cheesecake Factory! :D"
Alena B.,"Silicon Valley, CA",157,821,21,2.0,6/5/2011,I really don't get the appeal.  The wait is long and the food is mediocre.  They don't even have a children's menu which is a bummer.  The menu is HUGE which means that they do a little bit of everything and nothing very well.  I always opt for the chicken pasta because it's a safe bet.  The Teriyaki chicken wasn't great...i guess the potstickers are okay too.  The two stars I am giving it is for the cheesecake...which is OF COURSE delicious!   Please please please go somewhere else for date night....go to some cute little local hole in the wall in support of local businesses and find something amazing rather than waiting with a pager for 45 minutes outside this place with everyone else.  It's really nothing special...unless you are getting cheesecake!
Esti S.,"Scottsdale, AZ",88,230,24,5.0,2/28/2009,"Great place, good food, we normally arrived early about 5pm so no wait, all the chickens dishes are yummy, the bread is so yummy it comes straight from the oven. The portion are huge. I wish the cheesecake will be smaller size and a little cheaper.$6.50 and up a piece Service is very friendly a little slow but still 5 stars."
Connie C.,"Belmont, CA",5000,1539,1424,4.0,12/23/2009,"Ahh... The Cheesecake Factory will always have a special place in my heart. It was one of our go-to spots for group dinners back in college... lordy, that was over 10 years ago!?! I'd actually never been to this location until after last night's Elite Event. We were really in the mood for the Creamery, but it was closed at 10pm, so CF automatically gets 4 stars just for being open until 11pm on Tuesdays. Our server, Chris, was awesome. He was attentive, frank, and just plain cool. We enjoyed our massive plates in peace in the corner booth. Their food was perfect for soaking up the al-al-al-al-al-alcohol. CF is probably the best option for late-night grubbing along University Ave during the week. I mean, who really wants to eat Pizza My Heart? With over 200 dishes, you don't have to worry about not pleasing one person's craving. Plus, how can you not love their cheesecakes?"
Ray R.,"San Francisco, CA",262,571,6,3.0,5/17/2011,"I have to admit that this was my first time to The Cheesecake Factory.  I know it's really popular but I've generally tried to avoid places like this because after looking at the menu, i've always thought that it was just like a more expensive and glorified Denny's that happens to serve really good cheesecake.  In a way, I was right.   The bread (especially the rye) was good, the appetizers we had (calamari, crab dip) were a-ok, nothing special.  i had the shepherd's pie, lil homey had the ""kobe""-style burger, baby mama had the fettucini alfredo with chicken, and aunty had the fish and chips.  everyone, in unison, let out a collective sigh after we each finished our meals - a definite sign of medocrity. I was especially disappointed because the decor was so nice, and they had white linen on the tables, and it felt really fancy but the food just didnt deliver.  We had the Godiva cheesecake which was good and the red velvet cheesecake which was great. We waited about 20 minutes to be seated on a Tuesday night around 6 o'clock so the wait wasn't bad at all. I'd come back, not anytime soon though as it's just not my type of food."
Julien W.,"Palo Alto, CA",11,54,,4.0,7/8/2011,"The decoration is original, grand. The food is good, but portions are so huge! Beware when ordering, especially if you want to be able to eat a piece of their amazing cheesecake. The menu is extremely large, with choice of pasta, salads, meats,  fishes, pizzas, and cheesecakes of course (2 pages of cheesecakes). Go there for the global experience, it a very nice one!"
