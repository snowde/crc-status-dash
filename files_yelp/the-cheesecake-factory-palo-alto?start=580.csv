H T.,"Silicon Valley, CA",158,1024,231,3.0,3/6/2011,"The Cheesecake Factory is probably one of the better chains out there. They don't have a great selection for vegetarians and one thing that really bothers me about this location is that they seldom include all of the ingredients listed on their menu into the actual dish. The service here is always excellent.  Their huge selection of yummy cheesecakes are divine. I think it's also a huge plus that they've started including their nutritional content - who knew my favorite cheese cake was actually my entire daily caloric intake?! We will probably be returning to the CF, but only sparingly."
Sabrina F.,"Menlo Park, CA",0,6,,3.0,11/1/2013,Good menu .miss the new Orland shrimp.  Dislike waiting 5 minutes for to go order on the phone. Gregg is an outstanding server. Pleass improve togo service.
Liz L.,"Mountain View, CA",322,676,129,2.0,3/20/2008,"I almost never go to Cheesecake Factory anymore unless dragged.  I simply do not like waiting for almost an hour to be seated.  Why don't they take reservations again?  And why are they still so popular after such a long wait? That being said, the food here is decent, although it's not the best Cheesecake Factory I've been to.  The one in SF above Macy's has much better tasting food.  I like the avocado eggrolls as an appetizer, and the chicken marsala for an entree.  Their burgers are also pretty good, and HUGE.  Pizza is decent, and doesn't seem to be that unhealthy.  The prices are kind of high but the portions make up for it. The real deal here is dessert.  They still have the best cheesecakes I've ever had.  My favorite is white chocolate raspberry.  If you don't like artificial whipped cream, ask them to take it off because the slices usually come with 2 huge dollops of whipped cream.  The cheesecake is still kind of expensive though. The decor is horrible.  I don't like dim lighting, and their decor wavers between cheesy images of what looks like fairies and flowers and then these weird stands/posts that look like the eye of Mordor.  Seriously. Oh, they make good mojitos.  My boyfriend swears by them."
Maria L.,"Newark, CA",0,3,,1.0,6/11/2014,"Service here is horrible!! I brought my mom here a day before mothers day. And I ordered fried zucchini as an appetizer...after like 40mins the waitress asks ""so how was your zucchinies""? I told her, uhh we havent had it served yet. And she just disappears and brings the maneger to ""apologize"" for the miscommunication of the waitress and the kitchen.. They didn't even bring us any bread UNTIL I asked her for some when we were already eating. So ridiculous, and the worse part is that when I asked her for some she was like uhh ok. The waitress barely served us the fried zucchini before bring our entrees. It was unbelievable!  Never coming here again."
Lauren B.,"New York, NY",151,141,155,2.0,12/29/2010,"Went for a family dinner and ordered the Chicken Bellagio. I have had it at the Cheesecake Factory in San Francisco and was very pleased. However, the pasta was very dry, literally no sauce on the noodles! The dish was also very bland; the only flavor that stood out was the arugula. Very disappointed! Also, my mom ordered the chicken marsala which was also dry! She asked for extra sauce and they gave her a teeny bowl that was about three teaspoons worth of sauce! I'm not asking to be drowned in sauce, but don't be so stingy with the sauce please! Goodness: Wait was short Hostess was nice Fast service"
Doctor G.,"Alameda County, CA",0,1740,1,3.0,7/3/2011,"I was walking down University Ave. on one of those rare super hot days in the Bay Area and bypassing all of those trendy little restaurants that had all of their doors open for al fresco dining, presuming that the interiors of those great restaurants were probably blazing hot.  When I went into the Cheesecake Factory, I immediately appreciated the politically incorrect view that building a Cheesecake Factory from scratch on University was a good idea, primarily because there was a restaurant on University that had air conditioning.   My Kobe beef burger was really tasty.  The fries were great.  All you can drink soda.  I hear the Red Velvet cheesecake is the top seller, but any cheesecake is a winner in my book.  And air conditioning.   Parking on the street if you can find it, or in some of the many muni parking lots.  You might have to walk a few blocks, but it's such a nice walk down University."
Nicole G.,"Austin, TX",473,72,1,4.0,4/4/2011,"Very wide selection of food.  Steak, pasta, pizza, bugers, sea food...they have it all.  Martini's were good but super expensive.   I ordered Orange Chicken...it was ok...a little dry...had to order extra sauce."
Nit C.,"Belmont, CA",23,114,,3.0,4/27/2011,"As with other cheesecake factory, this restaurant is no different.  The menu is the always the same, a vary array of different types of food.  There are daily specials but I usually stick to the menu.  The food portion is really good.  I have never been able to eat a entree in one sitting. They are really use to people asking for a take-out box. The service is alright.  Nothing amazing but overall a good experience."
Katharine A.,"Redwood City, CA",743,1715,73,1.0,8/10/2007,"It never ceases to amaze me how much people like this place.  SERIOUSLY 4 or 5 stars for this???  Where else are you eating? I cannot understand for the life of me why people wait hours for a table at this place.  Food is less than mediocre or just plain gross.  Things just seem to be a big, soggy mess every time I've been.   It is all over-the-top, greasy, fattening American comfort food.  If you only care about portion size and are super hungry, then this is the place for you."
Kimmy G.,"Sunnyvale, CA",212,390,36,4.0,1/15/2011,"This has become my favorite Cheesecake Factory so far...since I live in the south bay and my friends live on the peninsula this has been our go to lately (right in the middle).  This particulary one has really great servers, and isn't as crazy busy as the Valley Fair one.  It's still a Cheesecake Factory, and there isn't much difference from one to another, but I do very much like their staff, the location, and the fact that their wait time seems to be better than others."
Bethany M.,"Oakland, CA",79,101,4,3.0,12/17/2009,"I have a confession... I don't like cheesecake. I know, right?! So this is why I'd never bothered to go to The Cheesecake Factory. But now I have and whaddya know, it's about more than just cheesecake.  The decor is pretty gaudy. Toned down like halfway and it might be really pretty in there. Just don't look around too much. The lighting is low at least. There is also a neat row of mirrors along the tables in the front that makes checking out the high-top tables behind you possible without turning around. It's loud enough that you can talk freely without worrying that people can hear you, but it's not so loud that it loses all sense of intimacy. The menu is too thick. Way too many choices. For someone with food ADD like me, it's torture. I suggest you pick something quickly, don't over think it, and just close the menu. Started with the Fire-Roasted Fresh Artichoke. Came with a balsamic vinaigrette and a creamy garlic dip. It wasn't bad, but a little too salty and I could've made it as good at home for a fraction of the price (it was $9.50). Most of the app choices are pretty straightforward, but there are a lot of them. Chicken Madeira for the entree. Let's break it down... Sautéed Chicken Breast - Pounded flat, two average size pieces, cooked well. Topped with Fresh Asparagus - Two spears. Really? Should they even be allowed to list it on the menu? and Melted Mozzarella Cheese - I'm inclined to never think something has too much cheese. There's plenty. Covered with Fresh Mushroom Madeira Sauce - Kinda sweet. Decent complement. Served with Mashed Potatoes - HUGE serving. Skin-in. Yum. My dinner companion got Thai Lettuce Wraps. They come with chicken, but if you want them vegetarian instead, they'll substitute your choice of avocado or.... something else. Enormous plate. Like a whole head of lettuce. Bright and fresh. For dessert, I had a slice of vanilla bean cheesecake. I know, I said I don't like cheesecake, but I have a weakness for vanilla anything. It tasted just like a massive creamy version of one of those vanilla tootsie rolls. Maybe too much vanilla even for me. With some chocolate syrup or fruit or something, it might be really good. The server wasn't bad. College age, for sure, as most of the servers seemed. A little unsure of himself, but no problems. He answered all our questions. Orders came out quickly and he was reasonably attentive the whole meal. I enjoyed the meal, but for the price, I could take or leave it. The sheer size of the menu is intriguing, though, so I think I'll be back."
Lawrence S.,"Santa Clara, CA",4,3,1,4.0,8/10/2013,"Went there tonight with my wife and some friends. The appetizer, Firecracker Salmon, was amazing. The presentation was nice and the fish was fresh. Everyone enjoyed their food. We ordered the turkey burger and the margarita flat bread. My burger was late, but they gave me a free bowl of Artichoke Chicken soup for the inconvenience. The soup was hot and well seasoned. My burger and fries came and it was great as well. I could not finish it all. My friends were really happy with what they ordered. The service was good even with the late burger. The servers were attentive and sincere. We'd definitely go to this Cheese Cake Factory location again!"
Matthew B.,"Chico, CA",35,332,71,3.0,3/2/2013,"This place is is okay.  I have eaten here a few times, and it is always average and corporate.  It is not bad, and I would go back, but I would look for better places to eat.  It serves an immediate purpose."
Corey T.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,24,,3.0,6/1/2010,"My feeling is that the Cheesecake Factory is an excellent place to go when people are unsure of what the want to eat: the menu is vast, various, and generally good.   I have eaten here several times. I've ordered the caramel chicken, the asian chicken salad, the fish and chips, various special hamburgers, and the avocado samosas (I'm a sucker for samosas). I have sampled from the orders of my friends and family too, and always with satisfaction.  The decor is overwhelming. Sometimes that's a positive thing, sometimes that's a scary thing. All in keeping with the gargantuan proportions. My main complaint is that I often end up with multiple waiters in one dinner (due to their shift changes or breaks), and the obnoxious advertisements that litter the menu."
Lindsay G.,"Lafayette, CA",0,10,,2.0,8/4/2013,"Eating here is convenient when accompanied by a 1 year old. It is family-friendly and I like the the menu selection is huge. I have eaten at this location twice. My first visit was decent, but my neighbors found bugs crawling in their bread. Last night's visit was no bueno. It wasn't very busy (about 6pm), and the service was slow and attention to detail was lacking. I ordered a Kobe beef burger, which tasted like it was drenched in A1 sauce. Spicy and gross for $16. The presentation was flimsy. Shredded lettuce mashed on the side and 1 tomato. ?? Shredded lettuce? Even at a corner diner, I get lettuce, tomatoes, onion, pickle, etc. There were no condiments either and had to ask. My mom's food was cold and hardened with cheese and appeared that it was sitting around for quite a while. I have eaten at other CCF and have been pretty happy with the food. Thanks for listening. =)"
Diana B.,"Menlo Park, CA",82,132,29,1.0,1/30/2012,"Absolutely horrendous experience here with the family yesterday. This place has gone downhill over the years. There was a time when I considered coming here to be such a nice treat. Nowadays, it's just a sorry excuse for fine dining and truly a waste of time and money. Party of nine, was asked to wait for 30 minutes eventhough there's plenty of open seats and there's no one else waiting. After ten minutes they call us to say our table's ready. Ten minutes to wait for the server. Server comes in and takes our order, ten minutes to bring back our drinks. Five minutes to bring back some bread. Twenty minutes to get our food on the table. Total time wasted? over 40 minutes thus far. Ordered some usual favorites on the menu, only to find out they were not available. Kids grilled chicken with mashed potato were super dry. Blueberry cheesecake? forget it, they're out too. We were a big group and for the money we spent there, we could have gone somewhere else where there's better service and better food."
Bruce J.,"Palo Alto, CA",56,26,3,1.0,7/2/2012,"I sent a complaint email via the CF website and promptly received a call from one of the managers of the Palo Alto location. He apologized profusely and told me that I would receive a gift card so that my family could give CF another try. Well, that was 3 weeks ago.  Nothing has arrived in the mail...surprised?"
Joyce H.,"Palo Alto, CA",83,441,673,4.0,12/28/2010,"I usually don't like talking about big chain food establishments but I had a great experience at Cheesecake Factory in Palo Alto.  I decided to take myself to dinner and sit at the bar.  An older gentleman walked over and sat next to me. The waiter immediately brought over a glass of ice tea for him and smiled at me and said, ""I'll be right with you.""  I watched her interaction with the man during my visit and found it really nice that she cared so much about her regular guest. She knew what he wanted to eat, that he didn't eat the complimentary bread, entered his order with very little discussion, ordered him some extra sauce with a quick confirmation from him, that he likes ice tea and she even put his left over tea in a cup for him without asking. They weren't talkative or overly friendly to each other. She was just doing a great job and tending to his needs before he had them.  I also received good service and didn't feel weird sitting alone at all. It was a nice experience and worth talking about. So cheers to the bartender. Thanks for remembering what really great service is."
Nandan S.,"STANFORD, CA",89,25,13,4.0,3/6/2013,"Probably my favorite place on univ ave. Whenever friends are visiting from elsewhere, we take them here. The serving sizes are massive. You can't leave the restaurant hungry. The food is good quality. Waitresses are smart. Although most of my feedback is for the dine in, I'd say cheesecakes are also pretty good. Keeping one star out because of the wait times and because they did forget my reservation once."
Lola Z.,"Oakland, CA",0,262,1,3.0,4/27/2013,"There are plenty of more colorful food choices in the area. I would never think of going to the Cheesecake Fx just for dinner with the hubs; however, if you have friends in town and they've got rugrats in tow... this is probably your best bet. They are VERY kid friendly; albeit, they don't have the crayons/coloring paper that most family restaurants provide, but the waitress was more than willing to bring some receipt paper and a pen for the kiddo to scribble on. The child menu provides adult size portions. The adult portions are enough to feed a small family. The food ain't nothin to write home about but you get your money's worth and you know that the dessert options are all good. They are also very flexible with reservations. The party arrived 30min late and they didn't bat an eyelash."
