Lori M.,"Los Gatos, CA",0,58,11,1.0,11/25/2016,"I generally love Cheesecake Factory, but not this one. Parking is impossible. Similar to a recent post, the place is pretty empty and there are tons of booths available. I requested a booth, and they made us wait 15-minutes. It's silly....More of the same with the service.....Slow, unorganized and we didn't get a side dish that we ordered (but they managed to charge us for them), no offer of a dessert menu, etc.etc. I've been to the CKF at Valley Fair and Oakridge when it's been absolutely packed and they get us a booth right away, and the service is awesome."
Natalie A.,"Menlo Park, CA",11,5,7,3.0,4/16/2017,"We had a family of 6 and had a server named Roger. He was so dry. He brought us 3 small pieces of bread like if we were just a couple on a date. We asked for extra bread as soon as he sat the small thing of bread down and he looked at us like we were some cheapos or like he would lose his job if he gave us more bread. He was not warm nor welcoming,super awkward. And he went to his break and didn't say anything to us.  The second server Greg came greeted us and was super nice. We all noticed the difference immediately. Even my 13year old sister was like oh he's so much nicer. He was very friendly and made small talk/jokes with all of us including my little sister. We asked if he could stay with us regardless of Roger's return from break.  Anyway moral of the story Roger sucks and Greg was awesome.  Side note: The food was good as usual."
Chanel E.,"Palo Alto, CA",51,20,3,1.0,4/19/2017,"Super frustrated with this place. I have been patient visit after visit hoping to get a decent meal or at least what I ordered. Yep, you've guessed it messed my basic order once again. No crazy add ons or substitutions just what the menu item includes.  Sheila's CHICKEN avocado salad. Missing the chicken?? Ordered for pick up on my way to work to find out I paid $16.30 for a box full of lettuce.  This place is way over priced and to hyped up with fancy lighting and gold decore. The food quality doesn't live up to the hype and I'm disappointed once again. This will be my last visit."
Rupa S.,"Malvern, PA",140,227,98,1.0,10/2/2016,Used to love this place at a time but now it feels like the quality just keeps getting worse and worse...  When I last went there - the place was not crowded at all... most of the tables were empty... but still our server had absolutely no time for us... We had wait for almost 10 minutes to get water and then even more time to get her attention to take our order and the worse part - we had to remind 3 times to bring our check...  The bread was hard and it felt like it was hard to a point where it felt like we were eating rock and not a piece of bread...  everything we ordered was either too salty or too oily...  Not coming back to this place...
Ken D.,"San Francisco, CA",0,57,50,1.0,5/29/2017,"Went there around 2pm with family, relatives and a bunch of toddlers. Waited 15 min to be seated. Ordered and waited, waited and waited for our food. The toddlers were crying because there was no food. I told my sister we should walk away and go somewhere else. Sister said we should stay and WAIT MORE. Grapevine next door was crowded but people were getting food faster than the half full Cheesecake Factory. The food came after at least 45 min of waiting. Paid the bill. Gave them good tip although we waited so much. I even thought it may be one of their off days.  Then on way home, sister asked me ""isn't the kids meal supposed to come with milk?"" - none of the 3 kids got their milk even though it says in menu. Waited never bothered to bring the milk.  DO YOURSELF A FAVOR: AVOID THIS PLACE!!!!"
David B.,"Dixon, CA",862,585,12302,2.0,3/21/2016,"One member of the group had a gift card to this place, so we came back.   Average at best.  This time I didn't get cheesecake.  Bad move."
Thao V.,"San Jose, CA",11,4,,1.0,12/1/2017,"Omg! This is terible experience i had at this restaurant. This restaurant deserve 1 start only for customer service! I ordered a shrimp & sausage pasta. They brought out the food without shrimp. I called a watress up , pointed to my plate and told her i didn't see ANY SHRIMP. Instead she apologize for it, she asked me: oh, no shrimp?? i told her to look in my plate and she still asked me that question ? After they brought my plate back to the kitchen, we was waiting for more than 20 minutes, my boyfriend food getting cold because waiting for my food. The terible customer service not end up right there, after they brought out my food, its really cool! . It means entire the time they bring my food to the kitchen to put the shrimp, they let my food sit there  and not even warm it up, just put the shrimp on. The shrim was over cooked , it hard & chewy . When we paid the gift card, it took us 20 minutes to get my bill back because the girl didn't know how to use it. I saw others waitress ran back and forth with the gift card, Cheesecake factory didn't know how to run a gift card. Never come back again. Ruined my night!"
Alma V.,"Palo Alto, CA",0,13,3,2.0,6/12/2017,"Came here for lunch.... Bad idea. Our server ""teresa"" was very rude. She came to the table like a minute after we sat down and asked us if we were ready. ""hello we just got here"" I asked her to give us a couple minutes she came back like 15 min later. I asked her about items in the menu and just kept saying ""what"" huh"" like she couldn't understand me. No bread or water was offered. Overall,  crappy service. Never coming again."
Ana V.,"San Francisco, CA",56,13,3,2.0,8/1/2017,"I would've liked to give them a good review, but had a not so pleasant experience. It was incredibly busy and loud for a 7:30 Monday evening. Had brought my nephew here for his birthday. Got our table in 15 minutes. Our server was Sandra. Took 15 mins for drinks. Appetizer took another 20 mins and it arrived before the complimentary bread. The entrees took 55 mins. My husband got the chicken enchiladas; nephew got chicken alfredo. No complaints from them. I asked for a well-done mushroom burger that came medium rare. The sweet potato fries were cold and soggy. Sandra asked if I wanted a re-do, but declined as I dreaded the wait. I was ready to go by then. The check and desserts were the only things that arrived promptly.  1 star for the decor. 1 star for the cheesecakes."
Beverly C.,"Mountain View, CA",0,4,2,1.0,7/31/2017,"Am sitting here waiting for the waitress to pick up my credit card.  Took another 15 min to pay the check.  Before that, it took more than 45 minutes for the food to arrive, meanwhile I already scrolled through many friends' updates on FB and news....  and the waitress said it had only been 10 to 15 minutes.  When I asked another waitress if there was lack of people working in the kitchen, she rudely said, ""I don't know!"" And left the table.   And I found a piece of spaghetti in my miso salmon, see picture I think this Cheesecake Factory should close down half of the restaurant because they simply don't have enough employees handling the operations. Worst Cheesecake Factory experience ever.  A waste of space in this nice neighborhood."
John W.,"Orinda, CA",28,2,1,1.0,7/20/2017,"Went to the Cheesecake Factory in Palo Alto last night and ordered the Southern Fried Catfish. What I was served was undercooked fried chicken. The meat is completely raw inside. Manager came over and apologized and asked for my contact information. I did not want to give her my information. I told the manager that the mix up was not the issue, if they served me properly cooked fried chicken, I can just dismiss it as an honest mistake but to serve me almost entirely raw chicken could make me sick and put me in the hospital and THAT is inexcusable.  Please share with your friends and for the sake of your own health, BOYCOTT Cheesecake Factory!!! I have reported this to their corporate headquarters. Let's see how they respond."
Manny G.,"Union City, CA",170,600,803,3.0,6/9/2017,"Are server was nice enough just not very good at his job. Brought water and said he would be back in a few with bread. Hmm Bread showed up 10 minutes later and he states I will bring out the wheat bread shortly. We never saw the wheat bread. Fresh spring rolls were terrible, they were soggy and falling apart. I had the grilled and avocado salad, They forgot the avocado the plus side is that after I flagged down our waiter he came back right away with the Avocado. My wife had the Dry fried chicken sliders. The French fries were good. and the Margarita seemed a little light on the pour. Restrooms were very clean and the Bar area is a great place to sit."
Kati P.,"Fremont, CA",79,277,181,4.0,3/7/2017,"This is for the Doordash takeout.  I got the ""lunch sized"" salad which was still insanely gigantic!  So big, they packed two dressing containers!  The one I got was mango/avocado/chicken.  It was very fresh.  The chicken was freshly cooked and well-seasoned, and a generous portion.  The mango and avocado included were actually ripe and not a stingy portion!  The dressing was very tasty, and the bell peppers/carrots/nuts/wontons were crunchy and fresh.  I would definitely get this again.  As someone who dislikes chains, you may have a begrudging fan in me."
Rahul C.,"Redwood City, CA",53,146,419,4.0,3/1/2017,"This was a good, experience. The food was just OK, the prices aren't too bad and the portions are pretty hearty. The atmosphere is really good but it does get pretty noisy in here as there are a lot big crowds in here."
Jennifer J.,"Sunnyvale, CA",12,1,1,1.0,3/4/2017,Ordered food through door dash their service was perfect food came on time. Once the food came it was a different story our food for myself and my co worker was TERRIBLE.  My chicken Alfredo was pasta in water with no taste of sauce and only 3 pieces of chicken.  Her chicken and shrimp was full of grease. I couldn't eat it and my coworker was really hungry :(
James L.,"Redwood City, CA",129,492,370,3.0,3/23/2017,"Cheesecake Factory is never my first choice of place to go eat or hang out, but this one is nice and quiet on a weeknight and also one of the few places in the area that are open late-ish during the week. Not gonna give a review of the food because it's standard Cheesecake Factory fare, if you've eaten at one before you'll know what it's like. ;)"
Karen H.,"San Diego, CA",14,1,,1.0,2/4/2017,"DON'T FORGET YOUR PONCHO OR SHIELD! And don't count on the manager to manage. I admit that I don't like leaving reviews because it can affect one's livelihood, but there was no way I could in good conscience not warn others about this incident.  Coming here can result in bodily harm, or at least harm to your clothes! I came with my family and purposely sat at the bar so we could watch a Warriors game while eating dinner.  We know that bar service can sometimes be hit or miss, but we didn't think we might actually get hit (with flying debris)! When my parents sat down, they saw water and ice all over the counter.  It was assumed that the previous guest had just been messy, but guess it was a sign of things to come. Throughout our short stay, a lovely (insert sarcasm here) bartender, named Scott, gave us a pregame show of continually slamming dishware (can only hope it wasn't glass) in the bin that must've been in front of the counter where we were sitting.  Thankfully his aim was almost as good as the Warriors'; that said the accuracy didn't continue... We didn't say anything because we didn't want to cause a fuss, but maybe if we did, we could've avoided the escalation of action. Scott's first miss of the ""basket"" was a plastic cup that bounced on the counter and almost knocked over my mom's wine glass before falling back behind the counter.  At this point I called the other bartender over to tell him about the situation.  I acknowledged that Scott might be having a bad day, but asked if our bartender could talk to him and stop the show.  He assured us he that he would talk to Scott and apologized about the slamming of dishware. Unfortunately, before he was able to speak with Scott, the next miss happened and the result was the remaining ice and drink in the cup he was throwing, splashing all over the counter, my parents, and myself.  Sorry Scott, I think only coaches of winning teams get this type of treatment at the END of a game. The result: my mom immediately screamed!   Scott's response: a haphazard, ""I'm sorry..."" As he slowly wiped up the mess with a rag.   The manager's response (who happened to be at the drink receiving station at the time, kudos on the timing): ""What happened?"" And then he walked around to the back of the counter to approach Scott. My dad and I pushed back from the counter and tried to wipe the mess off ourselves.  My mom immediately went to the hostess counter to ask for the manager.  Just a note: if you're the manager and see something like this you should immediately apologize and start handling the situation.  The fact that my mom didn't see you and ran to the front of the restaurant, to seek you out speaks volumes.  As my dad and I were wiping ourselves off, the manager looked at me wiping my face with my sleeve and proceeded to Scott instead of even offering napkins for us to clean ourselves with (this was so far into the meal that we hadn't even received napkins yet!) or apologize.  Here was another chance for you to manage, manager! At this point, I lost all faith in the manager being able to handle the situation and didn't even bother trying to speak with him.  I got up and gathered our jackets to leave.  My mom came back with the hostess, who pointed the manager out.  She looked 100% more concerned about the situation than both Scott and the manager. My parents spoke with the manager for a bit, before I butted in and said I had already been splashed on and we should just leave.   At this point they continued walking to the front talking and got the manager's card before we finally left.  The manager said he would speak with the bartender, but didn't really apologize or grab our contact information to follow up with us.  When we left, Scott was still working behind the bar... In the end, I'm thankful that glass shards didn't hit us in the face and that we only left with dirty clothes and not more injuries from the assault.  Amazing that this can happen in a major chain restaurant, but at least we can follow up with corporate about our concerns because this manager clearly didn't care.  Scott clearly seems to have an anger management issue and should probably avoid human interaction anytime in the near future."
Ron Y.,"Palo Alto, CA",20,75,11,1.0,1/29/2017,"Normally I don't criticize chain restaurants. I'm a food snob, so I feel bad calling out chains, since they do some things well (e.g., consistent level of quality across locations, family friendly, affordable, good for big parties). * * * However, my dish today was so disappointing that I need to tell you to NOT order the fried chicken & waffles benedict. I decided to order it because I saw the promo photo on their big LCD screen while waiting for a table. The photo looks like this:  It looks tasty, right? Fried chicken? Waffles? Poached eggs? Yum. What was wrong with my dish today: 1) poached eggs were hard boiled, and 90% of the surrounding egg whites were gone. They were basically two tiny almost-hard yolks wrapped with a thin layer of egg white. I suppose the chef cracked the eggs into a pot of water at rolling boil, so the egg whites dispersed. 2) the waffles were thin and super soggy. The promo photo shows thick and crispy belgian waffles with maple syrup in small metal cup. However, my dish came with the syrup already applied to the waffles (no metal cup). Since service was very slow, my thin waffles were mushy by the time they came to the table. Plus, it didn't taste like real maple syrup. It had a sickening fake butter taste to it. It reminded of me of ""table syrup"" from my elementary school cafeteria. 3) the chicken tenders were very small. I guess the chef is trying to help me lose weight. Otherwise, they tasted fine. (It was the best part of the dish).  On the bright side, this location is much less busy than other locations (e.g., at Valley Fair). If only there were other kid friendly restaurants in Palo Alto that can handle parties of 9+. Thanks for reading!"
Komal N.,"Los Angeles, CA",53,5,,4.0,6/11/2017,"I ordered key lime mango cheesecake from this place and it tasted fresh but toooo sweet. Everyone loved it but you cannot eat more than three bites in a row because its just too sweet. So if you are ordering cake from here, kindly tell them to lower the bar on sugar. However, the cake was ready on time and was super chilled as i ordered. My husband loved it. They even added whipped cream on top on request!"
Jeff B.,"Belvedere Tiburon, CA",3,12,4,1.0,8/11/2016,"0 for the FOOD 0  for the SERVICE 1  for the clean bathroom  Seriously, it's embarrassing.  We ordered a dish that came cold twice! Twice!!! We ordered a salad with salmon that came burnt! And dry! What's going on?!? Is this THE ""Cheesecake Factory"" we used to love so much?  The service was nonexistent we had to flag down the bus boy twice to get a waiter to fix the cold food and the hostess to get the manager. I would have understood if the place was packed but alas not at all.  Oh yes, and the ""manager"" with the leopard dress. It took her over 10 minutes to come over (After she helped we were watching her watch the Olympics  and apologize. I felt that she couldn't have cared less. She apologized and comp the food and the dessert Thanks? I guess because after we spoke to her, she disappeared and didn't come back to check on us. We waited an additional 20min to finally get our server for the check."
