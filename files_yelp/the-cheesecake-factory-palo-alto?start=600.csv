Doris Y.,"Cupertino, CA",26,29,3,1.0,2/11/2012,"I have to remember not to come here again. Or at least not to this one in Palo Alto. The bread were cold, the server did not refill the drinks and the restaurant isn't even busy. The buffalo wings, stuffed mushroom, house factory salad and nachos did not impress us at all. Actually the nachos were terrible!  The kids got kids menu sliders and pasta marinara, they said that the dishes were ok. The crabcakes were good although we had better ones as well.  I am  glad we came with the purpose to introduce our guest to Cheesecake factory or else this is a complete waste of time. I am writing this review so I will remember not to come again in the future."
Monica M.,"Manhattan, NY",115,42,6,4.0,3/16/2012,"I like this place a lot, only negative wad the dim lighting and the wait ti be seated but everything else was amazing! My Kobe beef burger was tasty, moist, & tender, and it was huge! I don't remember what chessecakes i sampled from my friends plates because i couldn't see them but they were all delicious. Also, one of my friends is physically challenged with 2 very well behaved service dogs & they were very accommodating to her. Our waitress was pleasant & very attentive. Nice casual environment, not too loud."
Heidi M.,"CA, CA",275,295,791,2.0,12/28/2008,"Not much to say about cheesecae factory. It a chain, pretty good food, big portions. I got the appetizer combo, which was mroe than enough t share between 7 ladies and a big pasta to split for all of us. Plus all of our drinks. Speaking of the drinks..NO ALCOHOL AT ALL. And im not a big alcoholic complaining of the lack of alcohol, but seriously, i got the JW pink lemonade, and i felt like i was just drink pink lemonade. And it isnt even one of those drink that creep up on you later, it was just pink lemonade. I tried the other drink and we all thought our drink didnt have any alcohol. We might as well have just gotten shots and used then as floaters.  On a bright note, banana cheesecake, is delish. LOVE IT! I prefer the service and drinks at the valley fair location."
Gary A.,"Los Gatos, CA",0,19,,1.0,4/14/2014,"Wanted to impress out-of-country friends.  Waited on Saturday evening for 25 minutes to get a table, which was OK.  Seated near the toilets and suffered resulting traffic.  Ordered, got the bread and drinks and waited and waited and waited for the food.  Complained several times and finally walked out and went down the street to an Italian place.  Waiting for the food was like calling a help line and the response was ""we are experiencing high call volume"", etc., etc., etc.  I (we) shall never go again.  Complained to a friend on Sunday about the experience and she said they had the very same problem at another location and would not go again.  Chain or not, they are headed for oblivion."
Gopi V.,"Fremont, CA",4,334,4,4.0,2/7/2013,The same great options and taste as any other cheese cake factory.
Jenny H.,"Palo Alto, CA",0,1,,1.0,1/7/2012,"I really wish Yelp would allow zero stars, or at least half a star. This place needs to be shut down to allow for a decent restaurant  to open in its place. I normally don't bother writing reviews, but this place got me so mad, I couldn't just sit by and do nothing. I've been here with friends a few times and the food is hit or miss. Strangely enough, the faster the food comes out, the better it is. I guess they fail when they take forever to cook here. The service is a different story. Each time I've been here, the service has consistantly gotten worse. My boyfriend and I sat at the bar this time, and were promptly and continually ignored until we finally left. We were going to have dinner, but left after we finished our appetizers. The guy at the bar just stayed down at the end of the bar and chatted with all of the other employees when they came by to pick up drinks for their customers. The whole restaurant was pretty slow, so there wasn't any reason for the service to be so slow. We should have left after it took between 5 or 10 minutes for the bartender to take our drink order from 10 feet away. I guess that's our fault. Then it took fifteen minutes for him to bother checking to see if we wanted to order food. We order 2 appetizers that were just OK. It was at that point that we decided to throw in the towel, and go eat somewhere else. Before we left we politely asked where the restrooms were. Without even looking up from his cell phone, he pointed off into nowhere and shouted ""around the corner"".  We asked the girl at the front desk if the bartender was new, but to our surprise, she said he was the head bartender and had been there longer than anyone else! I guess he's past his prime, and needs to go find a new job. I just hope he doesn't go work anyplace we will be dining in the future, because it sure won't be here again. Gook luck to anyone thinking about eating here, hope you catch them on a good night. If you do, you might actually have a decent experience. J.~"
Sean K.,"Lodi, CA",49,76,5,3.0,1/30/2011,"I know I've said it before, but I'll say it again. The only thing that makes one Cheesecake Factory different from another is the service.  I always get a meal I like. The Santa Fe salad is always great, and so are the avocado egg rolls.  The service in Palo Alto is good. You'd think in the service industry it would always be excellent, but it isn't"
Shirley H.,"Los Angeles, CA",157,241,43,4.0,12/18/2009,"Okay, back off haters, I love Cheesecake Factory :) It's true, the service and food here are both inconsistent, but this place is my go-to restaurant when I'm out and about with my friends, and I'll tell you why: First, the interior of the restaurant is spacious and classy. When girls take pictures, they want to be in a cute environment, and Cheesecake Factory is definitely cute.   Second, the pumpernickel bread here is excellent. Sometimes it's cold, but it's good even then. My friends and I usually ask for the pumpernickel only, cause no one really wants to eat the other white bread.  Third, the portions are huge, so you don't feel like you're getting gypped. Food-wise, I'd recommend you stick to pasta if you're not sure what to order, because all the pasta dishes are decent. My favorite dish here is actually the farfalle pasta with chicken. The pecan-crusted catfish is also delicious, though.   And finally, if you come here around Thanksgiving time, you can order the pumpkin pecan cheesecake, which is sumptuous indeed."
Al O.,"San Francisco, CA",1,17,,5.0,4/26/2011,Five stars for the service only NOT the FOOD! So i've been to this cheesecake plenty of times and the service and food have always been OK. But on Easter Sunday I went there for brunch and the food was horrible! The food was bland and definitely not fresh. When I explained this to the waiter (James) was very apologetic. He was obviously over worked  with the amount of tables that he was taking care but managed to keep a smile on face. He was the Greatest!
Louis S.,"Palo Alto, CA",0,7,,2.0,10/19/2014,"I've been to this place twice since moving to Palo Alto, with the most recent visit on the night of Friday, 10/17.  The waiting part was a pain.  First of all, the female receptionist at the front desk only talks to male customers and ignores female customers, which is quite offsetting and disrespectful for female customers who just came in.  The wait line was quite long and there was not enough seats, so we had to wait outside.  We almost left, but decided to stay because we really wanted some creamy and dense cheesecakes.  Now on to the dining part.  The cheesecakes were as good as usual -- thumbs up.  By contrast, the appetizer, salmon rolls, was too creasy.  Service was a bit slow, too.  Overall, there is space for improvement for this Cheesecake Factory location."
Habibti A.,"Union City, CA",56,21,18,5.0,1/25/2011,This is my favorite restaurant b/c its so beautiful & the atmosphere here is lovely ... Strawberry Cheesecake is my favorite dessert ! The meals are Also the experience here is wonderful & fun ....
Joyce C.,"Saratoga, CA",28,197,102,3.0,10/27/2010,"Eh. Have been here numerous times, ordering food at the bar section. For the most part, food was average, nothing memorable or something that I would order again. Only stand out was the special appetizer dynamite shrimp (tasty!), but shrimp size (small) makes price seem not worthwhile. Shrimp with angel hair (with tomatoes, not tomato sauce) had too much pepper, shrimp was overcooked. Decor/ambiance is the same for the chain - kitschy vegas-y decor, faux-classy ambiance. Good for groups, also definitely make reservations (esp weekend nights). He likes Cheesecake Factory because of the variety of items on the menu, decent bar, and TVs on the wall (not to the same extreme as BJs).  Would have rated two stars BUT Grace our bartender was AWESOME! Super sweet, friendly, great personality. Would go back because she's an awesome bartender, makes great drinks, but she's quit by now and is working on her projects.  Probably won't go back unless I am hungry at a late-ish time (after 10), and want both alcohol and dessert."
Kevin C.,"South San Francisco, CA",398,112,169,5.0,8/14/2009,"This is by far the BEST Cheesecake Factory I've been to because: 1) Food comes REALLY fast, and is hot when you get it.  2) Waiters are VERY attentive, always filling up my drink or bringing out fresh bread - without asking.  3) Did I say the food comes fast?? With most Cheesecake Factories, it usually takes awhile to get seated and then an extra 30 minutes to get your food, but this one has proved otherwise.  They have the biggest menu with the best food.  The Ribs taste as if they are Holy ribs from Cows that graze on Heavens grass ... really."
Emma K.,"Santa Clara, CA",0,5,,2.0,10/5/2014,"Came in on a Sunday night and it was packed . We were a party of 5 and were happy to wait the 40 minutes . Sat down and were given bread right away . The waiter  took our drink order... And then disappeared for 15 minutes . He came back (empty handed) to take our food order, and our drinks still didn't come for another 10 minutes . When our food came , we were never checked on. There were small issues with some of our meals that could have been fixed but the server never even came over and asked. Cheesecake factory is usually a consistent and pleasant experience , but this time the service was pretty awful. Will not be coming back to this location ."
Christine L.,"Auckland, New Zealand",183,439,351,4.0,1/9/2010,"Mmm Chicken Madeira is all I have to say. Its chicken breast covered with aspargus and mushrooms and cheese and sauce. It is so yummy. I have tried many items at Cheesecake Factory but I always go back to this one. When in season their fire-roasted artichokes with ailoi is really good. Ad the tamale corn cakes are out of this world. I'm not a big cheesecake person, but I like the white chocolate raspberry truffle. And my cousin loves the red velvet cake cheesecake. Just don't ask for the calorie guide, you really don't want to know!"
Samson W.,"Milpitas, CA",36,642,285,4.0,8/28/2010,"Went to this particular location almost two weeks ago for the first time, despite having walked by a few times in the past.  We came in a big group and had made reservations for Sunday brunch.  Turns out that we didn't need to as the place wasn't packed at all yet.  The food was very good.  Half of our group had the Steak Diane and Shrimp Scampi combo, while the other half had the Steak Diane and Salmon combo. The mashed potatoes was also good.  The reason that I am not willing to give five stars is because of the service.  Our waiter wasn't great all around.  Didn't check on us for more than half of the time that we had gotten our meal.  Also, didn't sound enthusiastic.  Yes, this is very rare for any typical restaurant, much less for The Cheesecake Factory.  Of course, I must mention the cheesecakes.  They are to die for.  I had the Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake.  Excellent.  But, then all of their chocolate type cheesecakes are to die for.  So far, I have only had two of their many chocolate cheesecakes.  Overall, good location but surprisingly isn't packed on at 12 PM on a Sunday."
SacTown G.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,245,1,3.0,5/21/2013,"The service was NOT as good as other CF locations. Just recently we have been to 3 other locations and all 3 were far superior. One of our items was overcooked. The manager came over to tell us it was cooked correctly.  Yes, really. We happened to have ordered that same item about 5 or 6 times in the last 2 weeks so we know what it should look like and char marks falling off the item were not correct.  FYI, next time the proper way to handle it Mr. Manager is ""I am sorry why don't we take that off the bill.""  Also, had the fish tacos and there was half as much fish as last time I ordered them. Oh ya, and the service was painfully slow even though it was 2:00 on a Saturday with a mostly empty restaurant. Anyway, overall not great."
Sam M.,"San Mateo, CA",0,16,9,3.0,2/17/2011,"The atmosphere in this place is great. The service was fantastic. But the food wasn't as good as I expected. I had the Carmel chicken. Not enough chicken, and I expected more sauce. My friends bang bang chicken and shrimp had way too much rice and only has 5 pieces of shrimp. We had the dynamic shrimp as an Appetizer and IT WAS AMAZING!"
Kimberly C.,"Palo Alto, CA",240,292,66,4.0,9/8/2010,"Why the low stars? I love this place.  The decor here is so amazing. I want my dining room just like it, with beautiful high ceilings, cloud painting and angels..I love it.  The place is great for a quick bite and drinks, dessert-mmm cheesecakes and cakes, romantic dinner or even a group dinner. The busiest times would be during dinner on Fri or Sat.  They don't take reservations, so if you have to wait, go grab a drink.  They have some really good cocktails. I've had their martini, mojitos, and their champagne cocktails. Very yummy. They bring you yummy sourdough bread and multigrain.  The hubs and I always finish 2 baskets.  Too good and I think its fresh. They have the biggest menu ever..I think it's a book.  It has to be with all the advertising they have in there.  The nice thing is that they have EVERYTHING!  From breakfast, sandwiches, burgers, pasta, fish/poultry/steak, asian fusion, tacos, and more.  If you don't know what you want to eat, go here..although, you might have too much to choose from. Yummies: Crab wontons  Thai lettuce wraps- my favorite! Love their sauces Chicken Bang Bang- yummy curry like sauce, shrimp, chicken and rice Mac and Cheese Dessert-  Classic Cheescake Red Velvet Cheesecake - THE BEST!!! Lemoncella cake- one of the lightest things for dessert but SO GOOD!"
