Kirsten F.,"Palo Alto, CA",0,15,6,1.0,11/13/2011,"The service is good, but a bit obsequious.  The decor is showy and ostentatious.   The food is forgettable, and served in portions that are too big to eat.  The prices are high, but hey that's my home town for you.  Not a great addition to our main drag."
Sabrina A.,"Mountain View, CA",512,1197,211,3.0,11/25/2009,"We had drinks and dessert here on a lovely Sunday evening after dinner.  We sat at the bar which was modern, clean and nice.  I always feel the talk booth chairs are a bit high for me but they are fairly comfortable. Our bartender/ server was super nice, attentive and sweet.  She closed out before we left but overall she provided great service.  But the girl after her when giving change to bill only gave large bills and so I didn't leave a large tip.  I hate that! The cheescake was super rich, the whipcream was super rich . .  overall it was too sweet for me but my dessert companion seemed to eat it all up anyways.  I had some champagne with chambourd - tasty. Overall a slightly romantic, sweet spot with pretty good food but for not so cheap.  Nice if you are looking for a late night, not too busy bar to chat, flirt and kiss at."
Earle H.,"Atlanta, GA",204,168,77,4.0,9/2/2012,"I generally don't do chain-restaurants too much but the Cheesecake Factory will always hold a special place in my heart because I went shortly after they first opened the chain back in the early 1990s and it blew my freakin' mind to see a multi-page menu of cheesecake options.  Plus, they have a huge variety of foods and they pretty much make everything that they put on their menu well.  Not much more you can say behind a 4-star rating.  The drinks and food are both consistently enjoyable and any variation will probably come down to the customer service you get at each location but again, you can't really go wrong with the variety and flavor of the food and drink options.  Solid!"
Zoe G.,"Mountain View, CA",5,34,10,3.0,11/13/2010,"This is a toughy. I've been here plenty of times and had good and bad experiences. In general, the food is great so its the service that needs tweaking. Good service experiences include them decorating the cakes and stuff when you tell them its your birthday. The staff are generally friendly. Bad service experiences are usually the wait time. And they once screwed up my order of chicken gumbo with no shrimp. Even though the waiter knew it's because of alleriges, i ended up with shrimp in my gumbo and they didn't really fix the problem cos i stumbled on the shrimp towards the end of my dish. Another bad experience was that they simply forgot to seat us for about 10mins even though we were waiting right next to the counter (where they take ur name). Only after I noticed other people going ahead of us when its obviously not right, did they apologise and notice us waiting. But all in all, i love the steaks and the general atmosphere. Best for bringing groups of friends who are visiting. Food great, service can be good, can be yucky."
Dustin K.,"Palo Alto, CA",140,34,27,4.0,2/25/2007,"I got the stink eye from the host when I requested a table by number, then something worse happened, he told me that customers can't request specific tables.  I'd done this many a time in the past without any push back from the staff.  In fact I'd get quite the opposite reaction, by requesting a table by number they would realize that I come there often and treat me well.  He must have been new... Overall... The food and atmosphere is quite good but the servers are hit or miss."
Lisa P.,"Phoenix, AZ",4,89,4,2.0,1/17/2010,"I went to this Cheesecake Factory last night to celebrate.  We started with champagne and the appetizer sampler. Huge amount of food and we should have stopped there, as the quality was OK for the price. Instead, we also ordered the cobb salad, then the herb crusted salmon and farfalle. Farfalle was good, great sauce and huge portion. The salmon was ok, fresh but rather blah. The mashed potatoes and asparagus were food. The salad was disappointing. All their salads are disappointing. It's like they use the same overly chopped salad as the base for all their salads, from cobb to asian and they could even do coleslaw. The dressing, the toppings, it all tasted the same as another salad I had at another cheesecake factory in Vegas. The plates that came with the salad were warm, and they were not exchanged when the entrees came.' Lots of food for the money, the quality is not great."
Jenny I.,"Fremont, CA",48,24,1,1.0,8/3/2009,"This was really disappointing! My mom loves the Cheesecake Factory, I'm not too in to it. This experience really ended it for both of us. We went for a late lunch. I ordered the salmon lunch special- it was not very good. What really upset me was the service. Our salad plates weren't cleared and I had to get up and hunt someone down to ask for a refill of water and tea, then wait 10 minutes after we had requested our check.  Not worth it."
Janel Y.,"Walnut Creek, CA",301,1407,1628,3.0,6/5/2009,"If there's anything  you crave, I'm sure this is the place to go. The menu has a large selection of pizza, burgers, salads, sandwiches and lots of other items. And the portions...they're BIG and worth the price. The food is okay but for the price, I'm willing to pay! And the cheesecake? Lots of variety as well, but honestly, I love their fresh strawberry shortcake. They pile on the strawberries and shortcake is soft and moist...I've never had any strawberry shortcake this good before! The last time I was here, I noticed that they skimped on the size of the dessert...I mean before it was outrageously huge and when I went it was just average sized...but I'm not going to complain because it was still good and I still couldn't finish the whole thing! The parking here is hard since it's in downtown PA and I hate that they don't accept reservations."
Star M.,"Rockport, TX",20,277,107,4.0,8/11/2010,"Only visited for dessert after dinner. Sat at a bar table -- quick, friendly service for dessert & coffee. Mango Key Lime cheesecake was delicious & held well to the next day.  Limoncello cake was the hit of the night.  Tart, yet sweet, but not too sweet.  If you're a lemon or meyer lemon fan -- this is your dessert!"
Kristine A.,"Monte Sereno, CA",275,404,97,4.0,9/8/2012,"Typical cheesecake factory. Except the fact that there are a lot of smart cookies in this building (hello....) and a lot of hipsters. This is once of the ""fancier"" locations of TCF, only because it is in PA! But a little too close to EPA for me, lol. Do try when you don't know where else to eat at on university, but go at a time when they are NOT packed. Not recommended for lunchtime because it's packed! I want to say more so than at dinner time. Cheers."
Taylor W.,"San Francisco, CA",0,29,,4.0,2/15/2011,"Yes, I was there on the lovers day they call it  .......... but it isn't what I wanted but I wanted it still. Hear why, I  was invited by my son & daughter in law AND her sister, & husband.  Maybe your thinking what a odd number 5  we were and so it is. Since I have a loving son & a good one who has this beautiful wife who has the biggest heart or should I say HUGE heart, they always want old Mom to hang out with them ( why? ) I don't know - okay, it maybe because I make them laugh or because, because ....... should there be a because? Well, i know I have a huge heart too and I know about food, fun and  just being yourself is the best thing one could offer so let me get this story going - I have to say this is a very nice Cheesecake Factory,  a better lay out than  the one in Union Square,  S. F. and  YES,  I love the city with a passion but have to say & add that this one in Palo Alto is very romantic  looking  which made the evening a desirable one. Mind if I finish this another time? I have to run for now i have a group of family that need me because they want my expertise in computers like I think I know or maybe some - so later til I get back and in the mood to finish off my review, 'Cest le vie ~ Back to finish this review - I have to say that OUR server was the greatest! If I or any of us get there we WANT Rose or Rosa, she's so kind, smiles a lot, very quick and made us feel at home. I sure hope I remembered her name right. I don't think she was Latina but she has this beautiful black hair with a smile that is genuine , she is a pretty young Rosa - Hi there, we liked you and see you soon I hope ~ Oops, I got a call, have to go, later ~"
Anna S.,"La Mirada, CA",344,872,131,2.0,6/7/2009,"I pre-ordered 7 cheesecakes for a work event the other week and I had set the time for delivery to be at noon.  Well, I bust my ass to get over there in time and find parking in downtown Palo Alto with my co-worker, and low and behold. They did not have the order ready, all the damn cheesecakes were still frozen and they were to be served in two hours. Let's just say, they only saw the order until I came and made the order. I was a little peeved, and upset because we gave them $170 worth of business, and they didn't really have to do much work!  To top it off, they were a biznatch to friggin' cut cuz they were rock hard for awhile. We had to keep them in the office for awhile before we served them. The only saving grace is that one of my co-workers was a master at cutting them, so we were able to eat cheesecake with some extra effort. I still love their cheesecakes so it wasn't a complete waste, but that really bugs! If you do a pre-order, call the day of to confirm that they will be ready."
Joseph G.,"Seaside, CA",3,12,1,4.0,2/11/2013,"this is a pretty good place to eat if you don't know what you want. They have a variety of diff foods. I came here for my first time yesterday and had the Hibachi Steak.....had better. I guess I shoulve had the filet mignon but for the price no way! 2 $31.90 for a piece of steak?? no thank u. But overall the cheesecake is good, had the snickers chessecake..yum-o!"
Ryan P.,"Union City, CA",5,34,6,4.0,6/11/2012,"One of my favorite places to eat, this location in particular. I love the fact that its not  super huge like most of the other locations are. Rarely have to wait more than 20 minutes for a table, even on the weekends. I usually eat at the BAR, and the staff that works their is super friendly, and really attentive."
Anne F.,"Seattle, WA",1,34,6,5.0,2/5/2013,"I went there last week. It was my second time at the cheesecake factory. I am very picky and I can tell you that their chicken with madeira sauce aspargus, mushrooms and mozarella is unbeatable. They serve it with smashed potatoes. Unforgettable!"
chao l.,"Palo Alto, CA",20,12,,4.0,11/18/2012,"Think of Cheesecake Factory as overfilling, high calorie food? Well, it's mostly true but their skinnylicious menu is awesome. Love the sashimi tun and crab bites (which is very much like what Nola's used to have)"
Todd S.,"Salinas, CA",9,12,6,2.0,10/17/2012,"It began with a short wait, to be expected, and we were seated. About 5 minutes later our waiter arrived, and was barely intelligible. We placed our orders and about 10minutes later our bread arrived, cold and uncut. Food was good service horrible."
Flo X.,"Palo Alto, CA",14,15,,2.0,6/8/2009,"This is only for a breakfast/brunch review. The eggs were from a carton (so not freshly beaten) and tasted like foam. The hollandaise souce on the eggs benedict was stale and kinda gross. This was the 2nd time we gave this place a chance, but never again."
Dee Z.,"Stanford, CA",30,168,,4.0,9/16/2010,"I've been to Cheesecake Factory enough times to go through the menu (that's built like a catalog) pretty quickly. If you are in an indecisive mood you will have a tough time finding something to eat because there are so many choices.  Appetizers - If you're into avocado - you gotta go with the avocado egg rolls. The mac and cheese balls are so wonderful and full of calories. The Thai lettuce wraps are good for an American restaurant. Salads - huge. You need to share if you're planning on going the whole route. Don't care for their pasta dishes, but anything red meat (although I noticed the portions are smaller) and chicken have been fine. The desserts - absolutely love their banana cream and dutch apple caramel cheesecake. Chocolate fudge sundaes, yum. I'm a big whipped cream fan but they don't need to waste it as a huge garnish. The only thing is the lighting...if I go there in the evening, I get sleepy...but as long as I can see the food, I'm fine. I really enjoy the experience if someone gives me gift certificates!!!"
T Bone Slaughter S.,"Emeryville, CA",1,10,,1.0,9/11/2011,"This place blows! I just got done having massive diarrhea as a result of eating at this place. Not only did I get what I think is food poisoning, the service and every other aspect of my dining at this restaurant entirely sucked. -Rude  and un professional host -Wait staff not attentive and seemed to care less -Food tasted good but my 30 dollar filet mignon blew out my ass almost as quick as I ate it. -Waiter delivered our entrees semi cold without our sides - told us he did not want our steaks to get any colder so he brought them out as quick as he could. Sides arrived after we had finished eating our steaks. -Table we sat at was sticky and dirty even though it had been set. We dealt with it because the original table we were brought to was not clean. We were told to wait until someone wiped it off. No one ever came after 15 minutes to clean it so the host sat us at another table. -We both ordered steaks and were informed by the manager that they were out of all the steaks except for the filets. We ordered the fillets then were told by the waiter that they were out of those too then informed that our order was really something else then everyone got confused. Even the man at the table next to us told us he would leave if he were us.  This restaurant should be the poster child for corporate run restaurants.  It is obvious that this place is grossly mis managed and unorganized and I will not ever eat at it again.In addition to all of the above, the advertising of other businesses inside the menu was a new one for me. Even Dennys restaurant hasn't resorted to that."
