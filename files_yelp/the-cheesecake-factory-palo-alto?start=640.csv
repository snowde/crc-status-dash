Deepika S.,"Redwood City, CA",77,123,22,4.0,6/9/2010,"I've been here a couple of times, but this one was a great experience.  Maybe because I shared it with an amazing person.  hehehehe. I was really in the mood for pasta since my friend had mentioned cheesecake a couple of days before.  So we're walking on University Ave.  I see some pretty good restaurants....A battle between Trattoria and Cheesecake.   I must say I was very proud of myself for making a decision and sticking with it.  They have a fantastic menu.  If you don't know what you're in the mood for.  I would definitely recommend this place.  They have a variety of asian cuisines, american and italian.  We had a tough time deciding what we wanted. First off, we walked in and the waiter took us straight to the table.  It was on a Friday night around 7 p.m.   The waiter brought us some bread and butter and walked away.  They had a pretty long list of drinks, but since we wanted to hit a bar after, we skipped on that.   When we finally decided on an appetizer, it was hard to get the waiters attention until another waiter saw me looking around and told our waiter to go to our table.  That was nice of him.   We started off with some chicken samosas.  It came with a yogurt cilantro sauce.  I wasn't very impressed.  It wasn't your typical indian samosa.  It was just ground chicken in spices wrapped and fried in an egg roll sheet.  It wasn't great but since my boyfriend didn't like it at all, I finished the other three lol. For my main course, I had the Cajun Jambalaya with Chicken and Shrimp.  I LOVED THIS DISH.  It was sooo good.  And I loved the way they cooked the shrimp.  I told the waiter to make it extra spicy.  And they did.  VERY VERY IMPRESSED. My boyfriend had the Pasta Carbonara with chicken and smoked bacon. But instead of the the spaghettini he had the waiter replace it with Penne.   That was yummy.   Cons-not enough bacon:) We had a lot left over because the portions were huge.  After looking at the dessert menu I had to have my tiramisu to go.  Not a good choice.  I should've gone with the Cheeeeesecake duhhhh!!!"
Kate B.,"San Francisco, CA",81,26,,1.0,7/25/2011,"I could not believe how disappointed I was in this Cheesecake Factory. This place is truly a factory.  They sandwich tables in so close that me and my friend were literally up against our neighbors.  I ordered a basic chicken salad  with some fruit and nuts. When I got my salad, it was dressed lettuce with nothing else! I asked my waiter about this strange occurrence and he seemed confused with what I was talking about. He took it back and when I got the salad returned to me, it had about two pieces of chicken and one nut.  It was so unsatisfying and unpleasant, I have never gone back to ANY Cheesecake Factory."
Dave S.,"Redwood City, CA",0,8,,1.0,2/7/2015,"I received a gift card for the cheesecake factory for Christmas. I avoided going there thanks to at best mediocre, chain restaurant food, I have had at the Pasadena branch, but I did have a gift card to use so my wife and I ate a late lunch today at the Palo Alto one. That was a mistake. I must say I had probably one of the worst meals I have had in a dozen years. I ordered the chicken, biscuits and gravy.  It arrived cold, not luke warm. but cold. I asked to have it heated a couple of minutes. When it came back It was missing the gravy and most of the chicken. When I peel back the center of the dish I found one tall 6"" diameter lump of dough with a crust on top of it. There was only about 4 oz. of chicken. Also on my plate were 1/3 carrot cut into 4 pieces, teaspoon of peas and a few pieces of mushroom with about 1/2 cup of chopped onions. My wife had ordered chicken madeira which had 2 large chicken breasts with cold mashed potatoes.  I gave her my 2 tablespoons of mashed potatoes which were warm by now. She said she loved her food but is complaining of indigestion now, 2 hours later. I do have to give 1 star as the French bread and pumpernickel baguettes were very good.  I would stop in for the baguettes but would avoid ordering any food. With all of the great places to eat in Palo Alto I am amazed this place is still in business."
MacDaddy S.,"El Cerrito, CA",8,58,4,5.0,12/18/2009,"I give this place 5 stars for the only edible thing on the menu. Its called the Classic Burger, and the menu purports it to be ""Gigantic"". Well they are right.  I don't pay for burgers that are less than a half pound (8 ounces), and this one is about 12.  Yes, 3/4 lb of BEEF.  I can get it RARE, I can get BACON, I can get BLEU CHEESE, and I can get Onion Strings on the side. Before discovering the Classic Burger, this place was a one star pony.  Now its 5.   I have not tried the cheesecake, though. Everything else is pretty much gross and overpriced, considering the fine Palo Alto restaurants it has to compete with. Oh, and another star for the fact that you can come here, have a drink, and not have to listen to Rap or Hip Hop music."
Erik T.,"Tracy, CA",17,155,4,5.0,11/5/2009,"Hands down the best restaurant in Palo Alto. I take my girlfriend here fairly regularly. They literally have different foods from virtually every different ethnic group you can think of. All of it is cooked fresh, prompt, and generously. Since we normally go during the weekdays, the wait for a table is 5 minutes at the most. I do remember being in on a Friday nite, and having to wait almost an hour for a table (but the wait was well worth every minute of it...) The waiting staff is very friendly and prompt, and the only complaint I've ever had is waiting too long for a bread basket, and that only happened once.  Do not even think of walking out of this place without trying a slice of Stefanie's Red Velvet Cheesecake. It is hands down the best cheesecake I have ever had in my life. I mean come on, you came to Cheesecake Factory for Cheesecake, right? You could go to McDonald's if you just wanted a burger and fries. The Red Velvet Cheesecake is the best thing that ever happpened to that chain, and I highly recommend it to everyone. This place is on the pricy side, it normally costs me and my girlfriend about $50 each time, but I promise you it is well worth every dime.  Overall, this is one of my top favorite restaurants, and I will definately be giving them my business for years to come."
Pa G.,"Palo Alto, CA",0,3,,3.0,6/11/2014,"Visited this location multiple times. Good service, good ambience, average food. Good for family dining."
Rahaima C.,"Fremont, CA",5,17,3,2.0,7/23/2014,"I have only been to this restaurant once and it is the last time I will ever go there. I ordered the Four Cheese Pasta and I literally waited about 30 minutes for my food to come out. I had a really nice server but I think it was just a hectic night. My friend and I did not enjoy our food at all. We barely took three or four bites of our food. Also, at the beginning we asked for butter for our bread but never got it. We ignored that part though. Even though our food was horrible, my friend and I still tipped a total of $15 because we saw how much our server was running around."
Lulu B.,"Redwood City, CA",3,97,,2.0,11/6/2010,"Arrived here on a Saturday night at 5 and got seated right away. Waiter came over to take drink and appetizer orders. Drinks came. Appetizers didn't. As we were waiting we figured maybe the kitchen was just getting warmed up since it was early...it definitly wasn't backed up because there was no one in the place. So we waited and waited, then overhead our waiter talk on his cell phone right behind us about how he only had one table left and he couldn't wait to leave at 5:30. A few minutes later some food arrived....but NOT our appetizers. It was our main dishes. When we mentioned we had ordered appetizers he said that he forgot to put the order in. Yeah that stuff happens, but come on...a second before you were on the phone complaining about how you had one table left.  So the food was just blah. I had some pasta and shrimp dish. The shrimp was greasy. The pasta was barely al dente. There wasn't much flavor, but it was rich. And now 2 Pepcids later, I am still sufferring from my meal. Yeah the cheesecake is good, but when the waiter brought my piece out the  lime fell off the top and he picked it up with his hand and put it back on the whipped cream. Gross. The quality has gone down and for $100 dollars it was NOT worth it. Did I mention there were only 3 people?? 3 entrees, 3 pieces of cheesecake, 2 lemonades and 1 martini. Ridiculous prices for such mediocre food."
Steve N.,"San Francisco, CA",188,150,36,3.0,3/14/2009,"My experience with the Cheesecake Factory hasn't exactly been stellar in the past but I have to say I really enjoyed our lunch on this trip.   I had the Renee's Special which is a green salad a turkey sandwich and the soup of the day.  The green salad was the baby mixed green type, it was ok but my unsophisticated palate would prefer iceberg lettuce. The sandwich was a half turkey on 1/2 of a small baguette. The turkey was nice and moist.  The soup of the day was clam chowder which I found surprisingly good.    $9.95 for a three item lunch wasn't a bad deal and I would order it again if I manage to end up at this or another Cheesescake Factory at lunchtime."
Edward C.,"Sunnyvale, CA",0,45,,2.0,6/22/2014,"been a fan of cheesecake factory for many years but portions have gotten smaller and recently prices have increased.  NOw its not as good value for money, I mean for $20 for most entre's I might as well get steak from another restaurant.  I hear the valleyfair location is far better than the palo alto one.  service at palo alto was just OK, a few mistakes made so not up to the usual standard."
Tal S.,"Paris, France",22,136,340,2.0,8/22/2012,"the restaurant is pretty impressive in size. the length of the menu is ridiculously long, just by looking at it you know you wont be eating anything freshly cooked with love for you. portions are ridiculous too and I don't like cheesecake 2 stars only because ambiance is nice, service is nice and they're open late."
Glenn R.,"San Jose, CA",156,278,82,3.0,8/2/2009,Iced mocha tastes okay but is over priced at $4.99. Good place to meet friends because everyone knows where it is. Cesar salad with chicken was okay. The quantity of dressing was a bit stingy. The chicken was tasty but not diced. I had to cut it as it lay on the lettuce (not easy). My friends ordered pasta plates and had no complaints.
shavana s.,"Milpitas, CA",1,87,5,5.0,9/5/2010,The five starts are for our waitress and the manager miressa or melissa :)  My sisters and i went in on saturday night to break our fast ( it was the month of ramadan) and the wait was 35min so we got our buzzer n sat like hungry children... long story boring the manger came to us offered us hot bread and butter so we can settle in while we wait another 7 mins go by being a total of 13 mins she gave us a table... at the bar but still we got in asap and our waitress was very attentive to our needs! thank you! Food is standard... its the  cheesecake factory people
Nancy M.,"Bel Air, MD",9,59,16,2.0,8/22/2013,"Visiting my daughter and came in for a very late lunch.  Not crowded at all.  Food took a while, but it was good...margherita flatbread and teriyaki chicken.  Here's my beef, place is nearly empty and the table next to us was dirty the entire time we were there.  There is nothing more unappetizing than looking at a dirty table and dirty dishes while you eat.  I'm just saying, Mr Manager who stopped by our table, clean the darn table...take off your blinders...of my soap box."
Lisa C.,"San Francisco, CA",440,552,396,4.0,1/15/2010,"I was craving the Cheesecake Factory, yet I didn't even order the cheesecake for dessert...how ironic! Surprisingly, their pizzas aren't bad.  I had the BBQ chicken pizza, about 10"".  It's definitely enough to share between two people with a smaller appetite.  My brother had the salisbury chopped steak with mash and veggies and he gobbled that up! Come before 7 and you can avoid the rush.  Our server, Eric, was very polite and checked on us quite frequently.   Oh...they now post the caloric make-up of the cheesecake out on their display.  I was envying the flavors and just as I was going to ask if the calories referred to the entire cake or just the slice, the gentleman quickly replied it was per slice...and that kinda scared me off from ordering dessert."
Jessica L.,"San Francisco, CA",50,655,,1.0,2/24/2009,"I'm pretty down on most chain restaurants...and for good reason, I think.  But, I was tired and didn't feel like thinking, so I figured--what's a better place to be mindless and uncaring about food--the Cheesecake Factory! And, mindless is just what I got.  The portions are ridiculous--nobody can (or should) eat that much, which just leads to waste.  I got a salad, which was in a pool of water (at least they washed the greens) and had no flavor at all.  I don't know how you drain veggies and chicken of flavor, but they succeeded.  The baked potato soup was the consistency of glue and was served lukewarm.  It tasted as gluey as it looked The one star is for the cheesecake, which is okay, but again, the serving is way more than anyone should actually eat.  And, I like the sugar rim on the lemonade."
Manuel G.,"Santa Clara, CA",26,100,86,3.0,7/5/2009,"How needs a Nuclear bomb.  All they need to do is feed us.   We went to the Cheesecake Factory for lunch. They gave  us the ""Calory Count Booklet"".  Can you believe what we eat?  One item had over 2700 calories.  In just one dish.   Think about it.  Almost 2800 calories plus an average dessert gives you an additional 900 calories.  Oh did you get an Appitizer or a Drink?   Don't get me wrong the food was great.  Cheese Cake is well known for good food.   Personally I am glad this new law is out there.   FYI:  Wifie had the Tomato Basil Pasta and the LOW carb Cheesecake.  Never would have guessed it was low carb with Splenda.  4 out of 5 I had the Onion rings, (passed on the creamy sauce to cut the calories) 2 out of 5 stars.  The Beet and Goat Cheese Salad.  4 out of 5. I also had the Mushroom bruschetta.  1 out of 5 Our server was a 5.   The booklet was a10"
Anderson S.,"Los Altos, CA",9,24,1,5.0,3/2/2009,"They don't take phone reservations because they like having a line out the front door. There, I've spoken the unspeakable. But in my opinion, the line would be even larger if they took reservations. I'm a fan of Cheesecake Factory. They consistently have good servers, large portions, and food and presentation quality that is above average. My biggest disappointments in the past have been with the kitchen. Major food delays, and once an undercooked hamburger patty (one of my pet peeves). But there were no such issues on this visit. The wait for a table was arduous, but expected. They ran out of pagers, so it meant multiple visits to the host stand. There was not enough seating in the lobby, so I took up residence on one of the benches outside. In winter months this can be more of a chore. We were seated in the bar, which was great because there was a basketball game on TV. Unfortunately, the screens were so small that we couldn't see the score or much of the action. Why don't they have bigger screens? After being seated, our waiter Roger M. was at our table in less than a minute taking our drink orders. We were waiting on one of our group to arrive, so while we put in our appetizer and entree orders, the waiter offered to hold off on the entrees until our last guest arrived. When Roger saw our final guest arrive, he waited for him to get comfortable in his chair before asking for his order. This is the level of service that I admire about Cheesecake Factory, and Roger was even above that already high level. I ordered the nachos and the grilled cheese, and was happy with both. We ordered extra cheese on the nachos, which is a $2 surcharge at most restaurants but a free addition at CF. However, the portions of the nachos were not what I expected. The last time I ordered the nachos (two years ago) they had a large mound of chips with a wide variety of toppings. However, on this visit it was a moderately sized bed of chips with cheese, jalapenos, sour cream, guacamole, and diced tomatoes. Really good, but we will order with meat next time. The grilled cheese was crispy as usual, but overcooked to the point of almost being burned. The fries were warm, but they didn't taste fresh. However, the next day the meal made for some very good leftovers."
Devon H.,"San Jose, CA",11,88,,1.0,2/16/2009,"I usually don't mind The Cheesecake Factory, but I do agree that it is a waste of space on this row of nice shops and better, smaller restaurants. My experience here was, well, bad; my girlfriend's mom waited almost twenty minutes for her sandwich. The only compensation we received was an rude apology, even when we mentioned it three times. In general, avoid The Cheesecake Factory. Hold out for a better, less generic restaurant. Hold out for better service, and better food. But if you are thinking of visiting this location, definitely think again."
Jennifer C.,"Sunnyvale, CA",158,188,62,4.0,5/12/2010,"Generally, I have a good experience at this Cheesecake Factory, so I'm still giving it 4 stars. My last visit was less than spectacular though. I arrived at the restaurant later in the night, when the crowd had thinned, for some dessert. We got cheesecake (which deserves 5's!) and enjoyed ourselves. We paid our bill, but stuck around to chat since the place was not busy, and not in need of our table. However, the waiter came by several times over the course of 20 minutes, each time clearing more from the table, including our waters! As a well-seasoned restaurant goer, I rarely have this happen. That waiter is lucky we tipped him already, because if he did that before I tipped him, man would his tip have gone down. Please keep in mind that the restaurant was still OPEN by the time we left, and there was PLENTY of place to seat any other customers who wandered into the restaurant later at night. I was a bit miffed by that, but otherwise did not let it get in the way of enjoying a night out with two friends."
