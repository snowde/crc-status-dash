Eta D.,"Millbrae, CA",0,13,8,1.0,11/10/2013,"lots of mistakes ...left so sad....food late, 10 to 15 minutes between each plate , missing items , and disorganized..slow service:("
Berna S.,"San Carlos, CA",365,4,,1.0,10/16/2011,"If it wasn't for the food I would not even bother giving them a single star. The service sucked big time!!!  I have two hungry kids with me didn't even bother to offer bread. Second, got the order wrong. I asked for a slider with cheese, got southern chicken sliders. WTF?  Apparently our server asked me for a clarification. When? Only saw him once. Never again!  This place just pissed me off!!!"
A L.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,113,,3.0,7/18/2010,"Funny how the restaurant is called ""Cheesecake Factory."" It does have that chain restaurant, by the book type of feel. Out of many of the chains that I have gone to though, this is one of the better ones. The interior is grand, and visually pleasing. There are large columns, high ceilings, and the decor is warm and inviting.  Was the food spectacular? No. It was good though.They do have a HUGE menu. Anything you can think of is probably on there, somewhere. Don't consider taking a date here - it can be very noisy. If it is your birthday they will sing to you and do a special birthday twist on a dessert that you order or that someone orders for you.  Service was great on the Friday night I was there. One of the chefs from the kitchen walked around and asked if everyone liked the food. Friendly waitress. I was happy.  This is a great place for dinner when you are with a group that just wants to talk and have fun in a lively restaurant. It's a solid choice. If you are with picky eaters or with indecisive people that cant choose a restaurant, you will be thankful for the Cheesecake Factory. Most people are usually just fine with coming here. Oh, and if you love dessert (like I do), you may just fall in love with the Cheesecake Factory. Fabulous dessert menu!!"
Naomi K.,"Okinawa, Japan",432,1824,4621,4.0,12/27/2009,"Yes, like every chain, it's well presented, nice high vaulted ceiling, low lighting, personal booths, and rich decor. Cheesecake as expected up to snuff. Open late, good service, clean, fits well into the downtown PA scene. Not super cheap, but decent. Impressed with our server, she was always checking in with us, and seemed on top of her game. Perfect place to get some late night coffee and dessert after a movie or meal."
Cynthia T.,"San Leandro, CA",27,135,5,4.0,4/12/2009,"I think everyone's probably eaten at the Cheesecake Factory somewhere in the US at least once in their life. So I won't talk about the food. What I will talk about is their 30th anniversary cheesecake. It was sooooooooooooooooooooooo good. (The person I had dinner with called it a ""party in your mouth"".) Using words to describe the amazing taste and texture just doesn't do it justice. So if you're a fan of chocolate, cheesecake, and DELIGHT, you should go get a slice of 30th anniversary cheesecake NOW. Kthxbye."
Ted M.,"San Bruno, CA",173,155,1,4.0,4/18/2010,"Had the tomato basil pasta, and the broccoli cheddar soup was great. The chicken pieces were easy to pull off, and the soup was hot, and the broccoli was finely ground, perfect. The penne pasta was cooked al dente, which might be on the hard side for some kids used to really well cooked pasta. Desserts were great, as always, and the service was excellent this time."
Alena P.,"San Bruno, CA",13,44,10,5.0,6/4/2011,"Great place fo BD, and just dinner. Everything is great , food, service, area. Love this place."
Archie R.,"Moss Beach, CA",899,695,12,2.0,12/17/2008,"Much like I learned at that ""all you can eat"" Chinese buffet 30 miles outside of Reno, NV...quantity cannot make up for quality. That was NOT a fun drive. As for Cheesecake Factory, regardless of how big that chicken sandwich is, it does me no good if it tastes like a 12 day old wet newspaper. I mean, this place is probably a draw where the biggest event in town is when Circle K has a sale on Marlboro Lights but c'mon, this is the Bay Area. We've got plenty of really good restaurants.   Why do we need not one but TWO Cheesecakes within 20 miles of each other? I don't get it.   Ok, it's Christmas, enough with the hate. The cheesecake is decent I suppose. Times."
Lynda L.,"Medford, OR",35,46,27,4.0,2/1/2010,"Visited on Sunday afternoon for a relaxed and way too filling brunch.  We only had to wait for a couple of minutes for a table - unfortunately when we were seated, it was to be in the center of two other tables with no privacy or comfort to speak of.  A quick aside to the host, and he was able to accommodate and seat us at a much more relaxing booth.  Nice!   The difficulty about CF for me is the menu.  It is way to BIG.  I can never decide what to order, and when I do decide, it's always too much food.  So MM and I decided to order some small plates and share this time.  I think it was a good strategy, but we still over did it.  :)  Our waitress was wonderful, food was good, company even better."
Dorothy Lou B.,"San Francisco, CA",2,8,,5.0,4/11/2014,How can you not love the Cheesecake Factory?  This one is especially good with a responsive wait staff and strawberry shortcake that is so good we always order it before dinner. :)
Tyler H.,"Ashland, OR",84,250,2,4.0,5/15/2006,"Yep, same old formula, like most other Cheesecake Factories...and, that's a good thing!  CF has an encyclopedia of entrees ranging from pizza to sandwiches to pasta, to ethnic-themed entrees.  If you can get over the somwehat cheeky fact that they include advertisements in the menu, you'll find pages and pages of 'specialty' entrees can leave diners a bit bedazzled by choice, but don't fear...it's hard to order something that isn't good.  Just don't overorder...there's always a wide selection of cheesecake that requires room left over in your tummy!  Value is also good here, since what you get can often supply tomorrow's lunch, dinner, or both.  I had the meatloaf sandwich, which was more like 2 sandwiches.  Other favorites include the Navajo sandwich and Chicken Marsala, but everything has proven quite good (and portions, huge!)  A recent find is the Hungarian Goulash...it doesn't sound appealing at first, but man is it tasty.  I am drooling on my keyboard thinking about it.  The salads are also enormous, so don't think that this is a way to 'eat light' if you don't have self-discipline.  I think they have a 'lunch sized' portion, which I would recommend, unless you are really starving.  And the cheesecakes?  If you have any room in your tummy leftover, yes, the cheececakes (and selection of them) are excellent.  I prefer the more simpler options, but there are some pretty amazing combinations for the more adventuresome dessert freaks.  Some people complain about the long lines & wait times.  I find that on weekend evenings, that may be true, but other times, it's not too bad.  Go on a normal weekday or for lunch.  I also want to highlight that I have been to CF's in Los Angeles, Baltimore, San Francisco, etc., and I find that on average the wait times are much shorter at the Palo Alto restaurant.  Be patient, people, and build that appetite...you'll need it!"
Andy H.,"Livermore, CA",249,332,222,1.0,3/15/2007,"We were looking for a place to celebrate on a recent special occasion and had good service previously at this CCF.  This time was enough to make us not want to come back. Our server Bianca was out to lunch big time.  We ordered drinks and food for the little one, but needed more time to decide to for our order.  Another server brought the kid plate before we even ordered, and my drink finally arrived after some more investigation.  The kid was almost done with her food by the time we got to order ours.  I decided not to have my dish and spilt the wife's plate since it was taking so long and we were starving.  The Steak Diane, which is normally an awesome dish, was over cooked and over spiced this time.  Bianca was non-existant, and we decided to get our Cheesecake at the to go counter so we didn't have to wait any longer.   I handed the manager our bill (which I paid minus any tip) let him know what was going on, and stood in line at the to go counter.  He didn't even attempt to offer us any help or investigate further.  The server at the counter was helpful and nice, but not enough to make up for wanting to come home and share this experience with my fellow yelpers."
Aaron M.,"San Francisco, CA",324,760,78,4.0,4/28/2007,"An over-the-top oversized-portion oversized-dining-room double-height ceiling restaurant for oversized-American Americans.  It is open later than most all places in the neighborhood (11pm / 12:30am weekends) and has the only great pumpernickel bread I've ever had.  Honestly, this place can be really fun and enjoyable if you can get past the full-page ads (for non-Cheesecake-factory businesses!) in the menus and know what to order, namely: - Avocado eggrolls - Chicken taquitos - Any cheesecake Get those three things and you'll have a very complete meal for two... and I know that doesn't even include an entree... don't order an entree unless you have a bigger group to share it.  Trust me."
Glenn H.,"Pacifica, CA",149,660,557,2.0,8/12/2007,"I agree with Alex G. This place could have been maybe 4 stars today had the service not sucked wind. The place was not even partly full for brunch and we waited nearly 1/2 hour for our entrees to arrive. We had three brunch items: an omelet, a chorizo scramble (mine) and smoked salmon. The bad: - Slow service to start for a nearly empty place. - A waitress that didn't seem to know her job (seriously) - A kitchen that didn't seem to know who to tell when the entrees were ready, so they arrived mostly cold. The outside food of the dishes was actually cool to the touch. - Management that seemed inept to handle the problem properly. - The bagel for the smoked salmon was cold and not even toasted, and the plentiful greens accompanying it had no dressing. - The sour dough toast provided was provided hot with no butter. When asked for butter (after trying to flag her down) she took a very long time, so the toast was now cold. - When they re-did a the omelet and my chorizo scramble, they charged us for two more meals and then removed them--the net was that we were charged full price for everything. - We were stuck chewing on bread & drinking coffee until they came out with the dishes again--by that time we were tired, pissed and not fully hungry. The good: - The management came out three times trying to apologize and promising ""perfect"" service the next time - We were offered a salad or soup (on the house was assumed) but we turned it down because this was more breakfast than a dinner. - My dish (when it came out the SECOND time--hot this time) was excellent. - The decor looked nice. But it was NOT a good experience for all three of us. Until this place gets it service act together, avoid it."
Cara J.,"San Jose, CA",79,211,10,2.0,3/10/2009,"The food is the same as any other Cheescake Factory (meaning the dishes I liked in Seattle are the same here). The avacodo egg rolls and portobello mushroom burger were great.  The wait was, of course too long.  The waiter was a bit of a ditz, probably from being too busy/over-worked.  The martini wasn't strong enough.  But, I was with good company and was hungry, so enjoyed myself.  I agree that eating at a non-chain place would probably have been better. Plus, possible illegal activity, although the bartender carded me (I think I've been carded 1 other time outside of a club my whole time in California), she didn't kick out a like 12 year old boy from the bar. I'm pretty sure he was seated in an over 21 only area, which means her knowingly let him sit there with dad and munch on food was illegal. Whatever."
Rahul V.,"San Francisco, CA",322,20,2,3.0,3/25/2011,Excellent ambiance. Like the high-ceilings. Had Evelyn's Favorite Pasta! Little pricey. But had an overall good experience.
Peter G.,"Palo Alto, CA",0,18,,1.0,9/10/2009,"Booooo.  Anyone who comes to The Cheesecake Factory to eat when coming to downtown Palo Alto is sacrificing so much for so little. I admit that I have eaten here a few times with friends, mostly after being coerced into it.  As far as chains go, I do think the cheesecake factory is not bad, granting customers large portions for a pretty low price. But that's all you've got working for you cheesecake factory. The service is consistently slow, and the massive ceilings and stalactite looking lights make me feel like i'm in a cave.  The teriyaki chicken was mediocre, and the sauce on it could double up as the sugary base for a bad energy drink. I don't really understand why people come here except for a slice of cheesecake.  Palo Alto is loaded with awesome restaurants.  The two things cheesecake factory really sells is the portions and the ambiance.  However, Bucca di Beppo has better portions, great service and actually tastes good.  Also, the ambiance and decor at Joya make the cheesecake factory look like a McDonald's.  And really, the food at cheesecake kinda sucks."
Tami G.,"Stockton, CA",17,44,12,4.0,7/1/2012,"The cheesecake factory is great because the menu is so big, there is something for anyone on it.  Honestly you know exactly what your going to get, its not the most delicious food ever but its good enough and its always consistent.  If youve never been, its worth a shot.  If you have been, you know exactly what its like."
J Y.,"San Francisco, CA",0,31,,4.0,5/26/2012,"In general, the Cheesecake Factory's food is not exceptional, except for a few outstanding dishes that everyone recommends, such as the avocado appetizers. The portions are large which is good for sharing, and very fairly priced. There is a large selection of flavored cheesecake, many of which are pretty good. I recommend tiramisu, its definitely the BEST flavor. The staff is very nice, and the only complaint I have is that the wait for a seat is too long (due to the high demand). A must visit for cheesecake addicts like me!"
Darren C.,"San Mateo, CA",315,40,81,3.0,3/26/2010,It's cheesecake that you come here for. Always have the vert best cheesecake. I just ordered a red velvet white chocolate cheesecake. They say it's 1500 calories wow. But worth it for your only meal of the day
