Michelle C.,"Palo Alto, CA",4,110,,4.0,3/25/2010,"Cheesecake Factory is a franchise and some locations are that good.  The one on University is pretty good.  You can pretty much order anything and it'll be decent.  My favorites are avocado eggrolls, spicy ahi tempora rolls, miso salmon, chicken marsala.   I think their cheesecake is ok.  But they have the best Pina Colada!  I usually get virgin."
Kathryn B.,"Redwood City, CA",33,258,31,2.0,1/15/2010,"Why is there always an hour wait here?? There are so many other fine dining establishments in Palo Alto. Branch out people! :) The food is pretty good, though, I have to admit. I like their chicken madeira. And the mashed potatoes are quite the guilty pleasure. Oh yeah, and the cheesecake. I can't say no to the Tuxedo. :)"
Uncle Fishbits Aeneas X.,"Belvedere Tiburon, CA",446,1654,757,1.0,11/18/2008,"Seriously... if you find yourself in here I hope you are on your way to a Nascar event or going home to your trailer (thanks Jim Gaffigan) Well....  what can I say. I got trapped in here by my lovely fiancee who still thinks Olive Garden is ok for breadsticks and salad bar.   It has a menu for fatty fatty chub chubs.  Fatty chubs. It is such a disgustingly big menu that they have advertising on it. And they actually have four or five different versions of buffalo wings.  No shite.  5.  And I got the awful and creep buffalo wontons.  it is mutilated chicken and buffalo sauce wrapped in a wrapper and deep fried.  I got them as a social experiment and inside joke.  True. This is NOT A JOKE: After my meal, this weird mormon looking couple were oggling me, and finally as they were walking out the woman said, ""How was your dinner?"" I looked shocked, because they were asking me that question at a Cheesecake factory.  Seriously. I said, ""what the buffalo thingy's?  Well.. they were buffalo thingy's.  Sort of what you would expect."" She looked me dead in the eye, smiling like a cultist, and said, ""oh my.  Well... we... we just thought it looked so incredibly delicious I actually made my husband walk by and look at it closer.  I hope you enjoyed it."" I made this confused and wretched and disgusted but benign look on my face like I was trying to keep my lips shut and not puke on this woman. Oh my how did I allow us to end up in a place like that?"
Chantal Noelle T.,"Union City, CA",606,135,486,4.0,10/22/2009,If your looking for a late night dinner with a lot of variety then this definitely is the place to go. I always look forward to the Holidays because of their seasonal and delicious cheesecakes. I've had the infamous Red Velvet cheesecake and let me say it is very RICH. Good but you can only have soo much of it. The staff is always knowledgable of their entrees which is very impressive and they are always friendly and food always comes at a timely manner! Love cheesecake factory!
Victoria S.,"San Francisco, CA",0,29,,2.0,8/1/2011,"I have no idea why the Cheesecake Factory always has such a long line. The food is mediocre but the service was terrible. Don't let the fancy decor and imposingly gigantic front door mislead you. We went on a Sunday evening and all the tables were filled and the wait was about 30 minutes. There is nowhere to sit in the lobby so we just went outside to wander around. We were seated in a booth and it took almost one hour from the time we were seated to the time our food arrived. Once we were eating the okayish food the server completely forgot about us and kept on forgetting to fill our glasses. At the end, we literally had to hunt down our server for him to bring us the check.  The food is pretty expensive for the quality but that's because the servings are gigantic. The first thing that popped into my mind when that HUGE plate of pasta was set down in front of me was ... welcome to America. I guess the reason why the Cheesecake factory is so popular is because it emphasizes quantity over quality."
Kari G.,"San Mateo, CA",236,754,221,4.0,2/18/2011,"Went here for a wonderful first date. You really can't go wrong with the Cheesecake Factory. They have a wonderful salad with goat cheese and strawberries. They also have an incredible Chicken Alfredo, delicious spinach artichoke dip and the Dulche de Leche Caramel Cheesecake is heavenly. I love the Passion Fruit Martini. The decor is the same no matter which Cheesecake Factory to go to. The vaulted ceilings are pretty and and they have deep booths that are perfect for large groups or private conversations."
J J.,"Redwood City, CA",12,56,,5.0,3/6/2014,"Food, service, drinks, all always good @ every Cheesecake factory I've been to! Happy hour includes food :)"
John L.,"San Francisco, CA",319,161,1345,2.0,1/9/2009,"I dined here recently with a large party.  We didn't have reservations so we had a few beers, wine, cocktails, etc at the bar while waiting for our table.  Our waiter was decent, she was nice but didn't seem to be all there as she was zipping back and forth between different tables.   The reason this Cheesecake Factory only gets two stars is the food.  I ordered a steak medium rare and it came out well done.  Not even a hint of pink.  A few of the people in my party barely touched their food.  I understand the portions are big but no one even wanted to take their leftovers home.   I've dined at other Cheesecake Factories across the country and this ranks at the bottom for all of them.  Given the location I expected better."
Truc N.,"San Jose, CA",334,200,45,3.0,12/28/2009,"I'd give the food here 5 stars any day but it's the service that blew it for this time.   This was actually the first cheesecake factory I've ever been to and I had a wonderful experience.  i came here even before it officially opened.  My aunt was invited here to try the food and to give the employees final training before the Grand Opening.  Service was great, food was terrific, and the decor was beautiful.  We had an awesome time!   My first time back was last Tuesday.  I had high hopes and things started off great!  We had front parking!  The host saw us from outside and got menus ready for us even before we stepped in the door!  That's top notch service in my book.  Too bad we didn't need his service since we were just going to the bar.  We found a seat on one of the high tables at the bar area.  Sat down and made ourselves comfortable.   We were not helped for almost 10 minutes...no joke!  We were waiting around for about 5 minutes before I cannot hold anymore to go to the restroom.  Told my boyfriend what I wanted to drink just in case they came by when I'm in the bathroom.  i came back out, sat down, and asked the bf if he's been helped.  NOPE!  So I was like WTF!  I told him, let's go.  I got my jacket, put it on when finally another server came up to us and asked if we've been helped.  we said no so he said, ok i'll get someone right over.  Finally our server came over, didn't even apologzie and she was not friendly!  She came by a couple times after that totally bitchy as if it was our fault for sitting in her section!  Totally brought the standards of this fine restaurant down!   5 star for service (obviously not for her but for the nice host and the other nice server for doing his job and acknowledging us) 5 stars for food -100 stars for the horrible server service!!!"
Dedrick S.,"New York, NY",17,40,,1.0,1/19/2009,"Went here with a friend and his family.  We were seated quickly, and they even apologized for the wait of only 10 minutes.  The waiter came with bread and brought us our drinks.  We ordered our food, and I got the angel hair pasta with chicken and peas.  The portions are HUGE here, I'm surprised I finished my food.  The pasta that I ordered was alright, but my guests had a different experience. My friend ordered the fish tacos, and he said that Rubio's fish tacos on dollar Tuesdays are better.  My friend's dad on the other hand ordered the meatloaf.  He received his food rather late, and without mashed potatoes.  The waiter said they would be coming out shortly, but instead they came when all of us were already finished with our dinner.  Extremely slow service, and the manager comes and explains to us that they didn't have mashed potatoes in the first place.  Why did the waiter tell us that they would come out shortly then?  They should have asked if we wanted a substitute side. Thankfully, the manager said he would throw in some cheesecake slices for us.  We ordered the 30th anniversary which was good, but a little too much for me.  I never understand why they put so much whipped cream on these things.   When we got the bill, we saw that the cheesecake slices weren't free.. and so we had to tell them to take it off the bill (which they kindly did) but seriously, could you have messed up any more?  Furthermore, the waiter was annoying, and when he saw that we had some food leftover on our plate, he kept on saying, ""Oh, you left some for me! How kind!""  which wasn't even funny, because the food wasn't even that great."
Christina C.,"Santa Clara, CA",3,37,2,1.0,7/24/2011,"Went here on Memorial Day before the lunch rush. I had my toddler with me and knowing that all Cheesecake Factory restaurants take forever before we get our food, I thought why not have take out which should be faster. Not so. Ordering take out took just as long to get our food as if we sat down. We waited 30 minutes before our take out food was ready. On top of this we had to go back to the counter to check up on our food order. I understand if the restaurant is busy we would have a little wait, but checking out the inside the restaurant table area, they didn't have that many patrons during that time.   In addition, the girl behind the counter must be new because she could remember what I ordered and she kept asking what I wanted.  It was so fustrating waiting there that long for take out food."
Christine K.,"San Bruno, CA",4,54,17,4.0,6/21/2012,Endless menu with something for everyone.... even the pickiest of eaters! I try something new everytime and am never disappointed. The only reason why I didnt give it a 5 is because one time the waitress forgot to bring the soup. She charged us for it and we told her we never got it so she took it off the bill and gave us a free slice of cheesecake for her mistake. i guess in a way we lucked out.
Surai J.,"Palo Alto, CA",73,569,57,1.0,3/20/2011,"The only reason to go,.... it's the only place in palo alto that's open late besides pizza my heart.   The food has gone down hill."
Jasmine L.,"San Mateo, CA",67,14,1,1.0,11/29/2010,"i called the cheesecake factory to make a reservation for 17. i was told that they do not take reservations but if someone was to come in 2 hours early and put our name in it should be no problem. my mom made the drive down there 2 hours early just as we were instructed and put her name in. we all start to arrive at 6:30 and the manager walks up to us and tells us that it's going to be at LEAST an hour and a half until they can seat us!  i walked outside and got on yelp to look at some other eateries nearby. we ended up at Cafe Renzo where we didn't have to wait at all for a table and the food/service was amazing.  honestly, the only reason we chose cheesecake factory was because i thought it would be a great place for a big group. if they can't accommodate us for that then i have no reason going there. the food isn't that great for the money you spend.  totally DISAPPOINTED!"
Linda P.,"Santa Clara, CA",13,9,,3.0,3/27/2009,It was my first time going to the cheesecake factory. I heard some good things about them especially the cheesecake. I ordered the chicken marsala which I have to say sucked. However the double fudge cheesecake was wonderful. lol. Not recommended to eat too many of those.  The place was nice but the parking would be kinda hard to find since it is downtown Palo Alto.
Mary Ann M.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",209,279,30,5.0,5/4/2011,"The Cheesecake Factory never disappoints me.  This time I had the meatloaf and that was very good.  Among my favorites at this Palo Alto location (though they all pretty much taste the same) are the miso salmon, herb crusted salmon, chicken marsala, and crab rangoon.  Don't forget the cheesecake!!!  Favorite cheesecakes - the one topped with fresh strawberries (#1), red velvet, white chocolate blueberry, and Snickers.  Overall, Cheesecake Factory is my favorite restaurant chain."
Kris A.,"San Francisco, CA",33,106,306,4.0,12/19/2008,"VEGETARIANS!!! Let me tell you right now, ignore the fact that this place has pages and pages of menu Just get the Grilled Portobello on a Bun!!!! I seriously doubt there is a better vegetarian option than this!!! It is by far one of my favorite veg burgers in the world!!! The portobello is delectably flavored, along with the caramelized onions...great combination...i prefer to eat it with a knife and fork (is the bun even that necessary?!!? NO) wooo"
Trvlin' Foodie S.,"Reno, NV",0,52,,3.0,5/24/2012,"Not bad for a dinner house.  Great for cheese cakes.  Service was good.  Pricing was good for the amount of food you got.  Parking a problem on a busy night.  Other than that, not much to say.  I would go back again."
Christopher W.,"San Francisco, CA",32,161,,3.0,10/22/2008,"I met my friend Leslie here for lunch one day. She works in Palo Alto and I wanted to visit her. The best part about this Cheesecake factory is there is no wait. The portions are big. I ordered the fried chicken sandwiches with french fries. It was too rich for me, I didn't feel satisfied, and the tastes were not right. I ate the meat, but I wouldn't order it again. The service was great and it is on the main street in Palo Alto. If you are going to go here, don't order the fried chicken sandwiches, just get the nachos if you want to be bad. I really like there nachos."
K. R.,"Scottsdale, AZ",4,179,8,3.0,12/6/2009,"Cheesecake Factory is your run-of-the-mill large portion mediocre taste chain restaurant food.  Although the food is not so great, this is a nice place for drinks and appetizers.   I never come here for a regular meal, but I do like to order the occasional calamari with a cosmo."
