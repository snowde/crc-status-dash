James W.,"Los Altos, CA",1,13,7,4.0,5/14/2012,"The menu selection was great, almost overwhelming.  I would pretty much go here to for cheesckake. Huge selection of pure sugar cheescake of every imagineable flavor. The wait staff was very helpful.  The Mexican Tortilla soup was really good.  I think over all, it is a nice ambiance, good place to take a date. JW"
Debbie K.,"San Jose, CA",5,20,,4.0,6/7/2012,"I had a business meeting here last night.  The staff were very accommodating and the food was excellent.  This restaurant has a very different vibe from the ones in San Jose and felt more upscale.  They have a skinny menu which is awesome since their normal portions are huge and often good, but not too healthy."
J S.,"Redwood City, CA",2,19,,5.0,4/10/2012,"We came in for their Sunday brunch and opted to sit the bar.The bartender there was great!! He was super fast and knowledgeable, not what I would typically expect from a chain restaurant. He helped my gf figure out what type of drink she wanted, and ended up making her his own concoction of a drink on the menu changed slightly for her. I was very impressed by his vast knowledge of drinks and food. He suggested the Waffles and Eggs Benedict, both were delicious. We had a wonderful time conversing with him.We will be coming back and sitting at the bar on Sundays as long as he will be taking care of us."

Kimberly H.,"Redwood City, CA",1,18,,5.0,1/22/2014,"EXCELLENT service. Came in twice in one week, just about at rush hour too. Servers were SO nice. I split an entree and our server had the chefs in the back split the dish in two separate plates without us asking. Definitely coming back for the great hospitality."
S K.,"Seattle, WA",2,125,5,5.0,10/17/2011,"It was 9 pm one Saturday night when we called to know if they take reservations and the lady said ""No, but the wait now is just 10-15 minutes."" We were seated within 5 minutes. Our server brought us delicious bread. Staff here are awesome and make you really very comfortable.  Our order:  Avacado egg rolls -Awesome and the chutney is worth trying.  Four cheese pasta - Really well baked and sauced to perfection. Marinara pasta : Very little or no cheese with lots of marinara sauce and basil. Great for weight watchers.  One thing to keep in mind is that the portions are huge.. literally huge. One entree is enough for two people. We had no room for dessert, but plan to go back again soon to try other items on the menu."
Francis S.,"Redwood City, CA",227,106,,3.0,10/8/2011,"I have to say...My family loves The Cheesecake Factory.  And it's actually pretty good.  The food's good, the service is fine, and I usually leave feeling pretty satisfied.  I have twp""go to"" dishes:  the chicken piccata and the shrimp scampi and neither one disappoints.  Another thing to note:  the servings are huge.  I recommend not eating the whole dish unless you're trying to gain weight - just take some home!  So why only three stars?  Well because the place is perfectly fine...but not amazing.  That said - amid the gamut of chain restaurants, I'd probably place Cheesecake Factory on the upper range."
Michelle B.,"Menlo Park, CA",38,12,3,1.0,9/22/2008,"Whaddya know, couldn't get a reservation for a party of 12. Very customer hostile policy. If you're smart, never have a party at this place. Who's going to show up with 12 teenagers only to be told you have to wait? Some businesses just don't understand customer service. Avoid, avoid, avoid."
Pam H.,"Redwood City, CA",227,162,63,3.0,10/25/2009,"Cheesecake Factory is a good middle of the road restaurant.  We ate here about a week ago with our good friends Diane and Mike along with their two kids and one of the kids'  friends.  We were seated immediately, which for a Friday night at 630pm was very good.  The place is huge and very noisy- which is good for a ""family"" eat out night.  The kids with us were ages 7, 7 and 3.5.  We were given a roomy booth, which is helpful with kids.   Service was good- waiter was nice and gave valuable information.  The kids servings are pretty huge.  The youngest had macaroni and cheese and it wasn't what he's used to- so my husband had it the next day and thought it was great.  But his sister and friend had enough food that they shared with him and all was fine.  The waiter did offer to take it off the bill, but we knew the leftovers would get eaten, so we said that was not necessary.   The adults ordered some appetizers - the Buffalo wings with a band (forget what they were called) were very spicy and good.  The fried mozzarella sticks were also very good.  For entrees, I had a flat iron steak (I love my beef) and it was very tasty.  My husband had the salmon and thought it was terrific.  Mike had lamb shanks which he said were also very good and Diane had a salad.   Amazingly, we were very good and did NOT order dessert, which really is a sin at the Cheesecake Factory.  Personally, we were going dancing afterwards and helping a friend's son celebrate his 21st birthday and I had a huge birthday cake in my car- so I knew dessert would come later.  The kids did have ice cream and they enjoyed it.   Overall, a good experience.  Parking in Palo Alto can be a challenge-but there are plenty of parking lots and garages on the side streets- which you're better off just going to right away, forget trying to find street parking!"
Servanne L.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,12,2,5.0,3/21/2010,"My Weekly Headquarter !! I just love this place !! First, great location, University Avenue, Downtown Palo Alto, you can't miss it and parking all over the place. Second, the decor, huge restaurant, super high ceilings, warm peachy color, enormous columns from floor to ceiling. Third, the food, their menu is like a bible, so many pages and chapters ! So many choices, such a diverse selection. Nevertheless my favorites are the fried mozzarella to start with, still melting while served at the table; any pasta dishes: the Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta, the Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic and Evelyn's Favorite Pasta. Because nobody needs to be hungry to afford a dessert, my Number One is the Warm Apple Crisp, my weekly sweet treat ! Oh and the bread, the black one, sweet taste, so yummie. Lovely place, humongous selection, great food, enormous portions. My Weekly Meeting spot with great friends ;-)"
Audrey K.,"Oakland, CA",24,131,,3.0,7/11/2008,Non-descript. Uneventful. Decent. Eh. The Cheesecake varieties are always the best part. Kahlua Cheesecake is pretty damn good.
Debbie M.,"Atascadero, CA",22,30,13,1.0,7/15/2014,"Today was my second trip to a Cheesecake Factory. Ever. The first visit was also at this location back in Jan. of 2014. Although the building is beautiful and inviting, the service at this location is lacking, and the food is awful. Not only was it bad the first time but it was just as bad, if not worse on my second visit. The dining area is incredibly LOUD.The wait staff is horribly unattentive (waitress and hostess chatting in the foyer while putting on lip gloss) while there were only 8 tables filled with patrons, most parties of four or fewer. Our table of two never got refills on beverages, nor did the waiter ask if we were pleased with the food. Nasty, nasty food. I would have sent it back if we ever saw him again before the check was presented. There is absolutely no excuse for such a poor dining experience. They weren't short handed. I counted six servers present, a bartender and a hostess. For a $40 lunch for two I think I could have fared much better elsewhere. I will never go to a Cheesecake Factory ever again, this location or anywhere else."
Florence W.,"Fremont, CA",122,281,27,4.0,5/5/2009,"Awesome Happy Hour! Mieko G and I ordered the avocado egg rolls, fried calamari, chicken wings and passion fruit mojitos. I don't even like mojitos, but they made me a believer! The BEST mojito I'll probably ever have! Avocado egg rolls were unbelievable, although i found the tamarind sauce to be way too sweet. I fixed this by adding salt to it. Chicken was good and fried calamari was perfectly seasoned. Their service was absolutely wonderful! The host showed us to our table and pulled out our chairs and was quite friendly. Best Cheesecake Factory I've been to.  Final Verdict: Everyone knows that the economy is bad. Being poor shouldn't make you sad! Liquor and snacks sounds like a great mix, is there nothing a mojito couldn't fix?"
Liz Z.,"Menlo Park, CA",0,3,,1.0,3/17/2013,"At 6pm on Saturday, the restrooms were beyond filthy, no toilet paper in any stall. Complaint made to manager, it took over 20 minutes for someone to go in & clean/re-stock. She was not too pleased about this job assignment & it was reflected in her attitude. Our waiter was absent most of the time. Got my order wrong. Wrong bread for sandwich, missing ingredients. Took over 10 minutes to come check on us & remedy that. No one came around to refill drinks. It took over 15 minutes for piece of cheesecake to come to table after ordering it. Ended up just having it packed up & taking it to go. The restaurant was busy, but not packed. Also, there was no one waiting to be seated in the lobby. There seemed to be adequate staffing, but everyone was running around like chickens with their heads cut off. We will NOT be going there again for any reason."
Adrienne L.,"Sunnyvale, CA",21,55,,4.0,12/9/2011,"We've always liked going to Cheesecake factory, good food and good service most of the time. There is a douche guy manager, the waitress didn't get an order right for our friend, the manager didn't even bother apologizing and brought the wrong order again after he told them what was wrong w/the order."
Wilson K.,"San Mateo, CA",27,231,7,5.0,7/19/2009,"Whenever I come to this location, I always sit at the bar.  The bartenders here are awesome and they are masters of anticipation.  Here are some lemons to go with that calamari.  Here's some water to wash down that meal.  Here's some extra plates to split your lettuce wraps.  Here's some extra napkins and forks for your cheesecake to go in case you can't make it home before you want to eat it. For a chain restaurant they really went all the way to provide five star service.  When asked if I wanted bread, I requested that I only ate the brown bread, instead of giving me one loaf, they gave me two brown loafs.  I really couldn't have asked for better service at the bar and cheesecake factories usually have a uniform standard of quality. Love their calamari, love their ahi carpaccio (I hope it's not the endangered ahi), love their cocktails, and love their cheesecake.  I am certainly going back on July 30th to try their red velvet cheesecake..."
H Z.,"Cambridge, MA",109,21,,1.0,8/26/2012,"Service is terrible at this Cheesecake Factory.  Came here with a large group for a birthday, and were seated after waiting 15+ minutes; this was expected since this places doesn't take reservations.  Service was standard at the beginning, but after ordering the cheesecake, server messed up what was ""to go"" and what was not, and put the candle on the wrong cheesecake.   In the end, we wanted to pay separately.  Server was adamant about not being able to divide the order per person before we even ordered.  What more, she even ignored our request to split the party into two tables in order to make figuring out costs per person easier, which makes no sense since we were more than a dozen people.  At the end, she initially told us we were allowed to use 7 credits cards, but then changed her statement midway and changed that to 5.  We ended up having 7 cards, which she initially claimed was not ok and would get the manager, but then she decided it was fine.  I do not believe a card limit is in this restaurant's policy and simply set by the whims of this server, but I'm not sure.   In any case, to add injury to insult, the server and manager (I think) come to our table, claiming our order was over $100 short.  After we repeatedly asserted this was not true and they tried to explain how we were short, the manager realized he didn't know we paid part of the bill in cash, and goes back to the register with the server.  They came back, saying that we were in fact right.  This episode made paying take over half an hour.... Too bad we were already forced to spend so long at this place, otherwise we would have demanded to get back part of the 18% gratuity we were forced to pay. I know it's canonical to do so, but don't come here with a large group."
Jessica N.,"Campbell, CA",73,335,,1.0,8/5/2008,"Good -Okay atmosphere...still sub par compared to other establishments in the area Bad -I have tried something different every time I go and it has never been good.   Between old pasta and disgusting watery fish deep fried in what tastes like the entire bottle of pepper, these people just can't seem to get anything on their expansive menu right. -Stupid looking beer stein style mugs to drink your water out of.  Perfect, I just love feeling like a Neanderthal at Hooters while in an upscale restaurant setting. -Severely overpriced -Slow service -Dirty dishware -Opposed California's trans fat ban (enough said, quality chefs generally wouldn't go near oils with trans fats)"
Mobile F.,"Palo Alto, CA",0,13,6,4.0,3/12/2010,"Good pasta, oily and tasty. Setting nice. Portion big. Prices on expensive side but normal for Palo Alto. BTW in one serving you can fill you daily recommended amount of calories... Efficient..."
Ocee D.,"Denver, CO",571,1201,2657,1.0,11/9/2008,"1 Star Ok, so I've had so many problems here in the past that I can't justify raising the rating, but I do want to say that apparently there is a new lady working at the pick-up section (receipt says Irma F).  She is a good addition to this place.  My orders have been ready for me and she has always had a great attitude.  good job for once, but you're still a one-star establishment."
