Joanna P.,"Palo Alto, CA",5,20,,4.0,10/9/2011,"This cheesecake factory is no different from any other cheesecake factory you've been to.  They do not take reservations so there are long waits (typically 30-45 minutes on a Friday or Saturday night).  The menu is extensive with basically anything you could ever imagine eating on it, all prepared consistently well, but nothing gourmet.  The desserts are amazing with about 30 varieties of cheesecake available.  If you want a burger, pasta, fish, or pretty much any other basic American food at a reasonable price in a casual atmosphere, this is the place to go.  Very family friendly."
Derek M.,"San Francisco, CA",11,25,18,3.0,9/6/2008,"Another day of eating out, came here because everyone wanted something different. Didn't really know why we came here instead of the one in downtown SF....easier parking maybe in Palo Alto? Everyone was a little intoxicated already so decisions were not really clear... We ordered the Spinach Dip w/ chips as a appetizer. Comes with Salsa and Sour Cream also. Not bad, I liked it a lot....probably would have liked it more if my colleagues didn't scarf it down like it was their last meal on earth. As if the free bread isn't enough...Rye bread (Dark Brown) is the better one BTW as opposed to the white one. Didn't feel like trying anything new so I went and ordered what I usually get here which is pasta. Can't go wrong with the Pasta Da Vinci, comes with Grilled Chicken, Mushrooms, Shitake Mushrooms, with Penne Pasta in some sort of creamy sauce. Had the Waiter go crazy on the Parmesan Cheese also. I feel bad for them because I don't tell them to stop till most of the pasta is all smothered with it. This time was a first for me, never had the waiter ask me, ""Do I want the whole piece in there?"" Funny guy....Who doesn't like cheese?!? Screw him, I would have made him grade the bitch for another minute... Also ordered the J.W's Pink Lemonade, like always. Forgot what was in it but I recommend trying it out if you didn't. Drank 2 of those the other time a had a good buzz....unless I was weak sauce that day I don't know. My friend claims its a creeper tho....I suppose it is because after dinner another buddy yacked in my friends car and it was HORRIBLE... Typical Cheesecake Factory....same shit just another day."
She R. A.,"Portland, OR",69,142,7,2.0,9/23/2008,"I should have known from the start of my visit here that it would not be good. I haven't been to a Cheesecake Factory in AGES. The ones in San Jose and NY seemed ok but the one in Palo Alto of all places was well it started off kind of gross.  So I while I was in restroom and notice a hostess heading out from the bathroom doesn't even bother washing her hands. She just runs directly for the exit while I'm thoroughly washing my hands clean.  Once we are seated it takes a while to get service. (You figure late on a Monday night it shouldn't be that long of a wait to get our orders in) I get the sampler appetizer platter to share with my friends. mmmm grease bomb (but coming here you have to know that is what you'll be getting) The appetizers weren't that bad except for this really bad version of Vietnamese spring rolls. That was just awful. The other dish in the sampler I was kind of disappointed with was the sweet cornmeal cakes. It's kind of a knock off of the Chevy's sweet cornmeal/bread but I think I like the Chevy's version better. The Cheesecake Factory version was WAY too sweet.  Everyone else in my group seemed to be ok with their dishes. I know some of them hated the fries they got with their meal. (How can anyone mess up fries of all things.)  So for the price and the food experience we got, I need to remember not to come here."
Evelyn K.," Santiago, Chile",54,416,192,3.0,6/9/2013,"Huge menu, large portions, standard prices.  Oh, the familiarity of the Cheesecake Factory!  In high school, my favorite was the Thai Lettuce Wraps appetizer and black bread with butter.  Rarely had room for cheesecake, even though cheesecake is one of my favorite desserts!  The one in downtown PA doesn't feel quite like other locations, and I can't quite put my finger on why.  The wood and decor scheme are the same, but perhaps it's the fact that it's never as busy as other locations I'm used to where there is usually a long wait, or that I've only been here for lunch.  This one is located smack on University Avenue, the main corridor of downtown Palo Alto.  Revolving door opens to a big empty area and you have to go through a doorway and go to the other side to get to another dining room and the restrooms.  Strange setup, as if they combined 2 buildings and wanted to make sure they could easily go back to separate buildings."
Frankie W.,"Eugene, OR",225,279,47,4.0,5/4/2008,"I don't know what you guys are talking about.  The food was really good... I was meeting a friend of mine for the first time (Maybe a date?) Ha ha.. And when we arrived we were immediately seated (but I think she was waiting for me for 5-10 minutes. We ordered the Firecracker Salmon Rolls for the Appetizer, and as for the main dish, I got the Pasta da Vinci and she got the Grilled Skirt Steak. How do I remember all this? Well.. I'm reading off from the menu they have on their website.. Oh yeah, what was cool too, was that the waiter still served us alcoholic drinks even though I didn't have my ID on me... well that's cool hehe.  I got the Georgia Peach and my date got the Banana Daquiri.  Two of each.  It actually took a while for our food to come though-- about 20 minutes since our order, but it actually didn't seem that long because we were busy chatting away.  They gave us large portions too, when the food did arrive, and it was hot and fresh.  Also, we of course, got the complimentary bread to munch on. The waiter was so damn annoying though, he kept coming over our table to check on us.  What a way to ruin our date...  I guess that's what waiters are supposed to do...give us ""splendid"" service..but it was a little over the top, I'd say... ""HOW ARE YOU GUYS DOING??"" -good... ""GREAT."" *5 min later..* ""HOW ARE YOU GUYS--"" -...great.....!!... ""YEAH OKAY.."" and then repeat about 80 times.. Oh yeah, so once we were done, well we had enough to bring home, they asked if we wanted desert, I was going to say no, but  the date-- she was like, ""Oh that sounds good!! Hey Frances, you have to try the cheesecakes..You can't possibly have a full stomach until you try this..."" and I went, ""oh.. okay sure.. "" *Actually... I was EXTREMELY full.. I was about to puke, maybe* And because of that damn cheesecake, I think I just gained back another 6 lbs.. The bathrooms are also nice looking.  As in no urine on the toilet seats. I think our tab was probably really high.. I'm not sure because I didn't check our bill or pay for it... The menus never say how much the meals/beverages/appetizers/etc. costs. And they only give you one menu per table/group.  Also, when it's about 7-8pm-ish, they start dimming the lights and it becomes hella dark inside... They think it's romantic but.. I CAN'T FREAKING SEE.. So for that being said, I deduct one star.   Side note: get here before 6pm if you're having dinner, because it WILL get very crowded and there will be a long waiting line.  Parking is hard to find."
Kristin G.,"Reston, VA",123,422,13,2.0,4/1/2008,"The food is mediocre, but the portions are huge.  I just can't figure out why people like this place. The cheesecake isn't bad, but it's not the best I've had. Nothing is fast there, seating, or service."
Allison L.,"Berkeley, CA",181,747,2,3.0,6/21/2008,"Gift card from Mom. As was the last visit to the Cheesecake Factory, that one in Union Square. We waited a freaking HOUR to get our free meal. This afternoon, we just cruised in and were seated in this huge fresco nightmare. It's a funny nightmare, though, and my portobello mushroom burger was pretty decent. The service is plastic, though. What do you expect? Next gift card, we'll probably be back."
C O.,"Washington, DC",1,62,,1.0,5/10/2010,"While the food is decent (standard Cheescake Factory fare--nothing to complain about), I've experienced some of the worst customer service I've ever found, spaced several months apart. This location apparently doesn't teach their waiters about allergies, let alone etiquette.  Once, upon inquiring whether a dish contained an ingredient I was allergic to, a server told me that it was the chef's secret recipe, and he wouldn't be telling me. I got this runaround on multiple dishes--I think he was just too lazy to go ask. Eventually, I persuaded him to get answers, and received curt and inattentive service for the rest of the meal.  Another time, a different server responded to me asking whether a dessert could come without the ingredient in question by telling me that it really was better with it, and I should give it a try. Sure, I get it--a lot of people will say they're allergic to food when they really just don't care for it. Me? We'll be pulling out the Epi-pen if you'd rather go that route. After I said so, she suggested I just not have the dish, because it wouldn't be the same. Again, no willingness to simply answer the question.  Another time, I had a waiter ask me whether I carried an Epi-pen when I asked about allergies. Might've just been trying to make conversation, but it's rather intrusive, and came across as though he was trying to verify whether I really did have allergies. After that, I decided to just give up on this location. I haven't been back in a few months, and don't plan on returning. There are better Cheesecake Factories elsewhere."
Stephanie S.,"Palo Alto, CA",111,267,105,3.0,4/23/2011,"While taking a walk down University Ave., the best friend finally convinced me to get dessert here. We get there around 10:00pm and get seated right away. The ambiance is super nice- great for a date or hanging out with friends. Our server was really nice and patient too. We ordered a couple drinks and an oreo cheesecake. Drinks were decent, and the cheesecake was just okay. The best friend said that the Jack-in-the-Box oreo milkshake tasted better than the cheesecake, haha. So we'll have to try something else next time. Despite the food being whatevers, I would still come back because it'd be a great place to hang out or talk. There's a huge selection of food, so I wouldn't dismiss it completely just because of one slice of cheesecake!"
Joey H.,"San Francisco, CA",54,244,5,4.0,7/23/2009,"This was a pleasant evening.  As I waited at home playing Call of Duty 4 and NHL 09 on XBOX 360, I kept thinking about the Creamery Milkshakes that was going to satisfy my sweet tooth.  Although, it was just a bit too late since they closed earlier than what I expected.  Teh CB and I made a decision together to eat at Cheeseste...cake Factory in teh PA.  Got to the restaurant about 945pm and asked how long the wait was.  Silly question since it was almost 10pm.  No wait!  I told the hostess ""no rush, my hot date isn't here yet.""  She smiled and said ok.  I walk outside, call teh CB and tell her that there's parking right in front of the ristorante.  Woohoo!  Score! Inside, we take a seat and Shawn comes up and gives us our menus.  Within minutes, he seats two people in the table next to us.  I look over and give a ""eh""  Whatever.  Anyway, he saves his breath and tells both tables the specials for today, but I wasn't too interested in them.  teh CB and I share calamari, margherita pizza, side salad with green cheese, and a Chicken Marsala for our main entree.   Each area of this meal was delicious.  The best part was dessert, where I ordered a cold, close to frozen, strawberry cheesecake.  I LOVE COLD SWEETS.  Cold cookies, cold cake.  Mmmm.  Cold chocolate.   Yes, my friends always say, ""Why is it cold?"", after putting in their mouth."
Eunice S.,"San Jose, CA",57,72,3,2.0,6/20/2011,"the service is ehh, the food is ehhh, and the parking is ehh.  I never really come here unless I meet up with friends in Palo Alto but this place sucks. I'd rather go the one in Valley Fair. I have nothing really good to say about this place."
Ravi A.,"San Francisco, CA",17,192,8,3.0,6/17/2011,"Service is somethings awesome, sometimes terrible. Food is so incredibly bad for you it blows my mind. When I see ""Grilled chicken"" and learn it has 50 grams of fat, I wonder how that is possible. How did we go from chicken breast, lean and full of protein, to 50 g of fat? That said, the cheesecakes all rock, especially the apple strudel and 30th anniversary. And the turkey burger is fantastic, as is the factory chopped salad. So those are my 3 go to things here."
George P.,"Santa Clara, CA",0,8,,2.0,10/23/2009,"Place is big and nice, service is not the best the moment you arrive they rush you to read a menu and see what you want. Server remove my dates knife only and left the plates there, dirty!!! After appetaiser we had to share my knife is ok my date..  Lol!! Food is ok. my dates prawns were over cook..  I think that's easy to do. The server never introduce him self.."
Tom T.,"New York, NY",10,29,,1.0,6/3/2008,"First off....this nasty experience happened almost 4 years ago, BUT.... Ok, so I got NASTY food poisoning from my chicken quesadilla- I will spare the details, but trust me it sucked. I think the kitchen is not equipped to handle the amount of food they offer on the huge menu, therefore food storage is not up to par and things go bad. I will stick to the SF Union Square location, and probably only for cheesecake."
Travis D.,"Houston, TX",67,437,18,2.0,6/20/2008,"The section of Palo Alto in and around University is loaded with some great (and not so great) restaurants, many of which are not chains. However, the one place that you are guaranteed to find a line out the door every single night of the week is Cheesecake factory. They pretty much embody everything i could dislike about a restaurant: they are a huge chain: they serve uninspired and uninteresting food, prices are high, and their worst offense is that instead of having a smaller menu with some focus and a series of well thought out, well executed, and innovative dishes, they have this behemoth of a menu with pages upon pages of dishes you could find anywhere else.  For my GF however, Cheesecake Factory is a bit of a guilty pleasure. She knows she shouldn't like it, but she does anyway. We went last Friday for their happy hour bar menu and split 4 dishes that were all under $5. We got mini cuban sandwiches, avocado egg rolls, lettuce wraps, and a quesadilla. Everything was good, but you shouldn't be able to order all of that stuff (especially since none of those dishes had a 'twist') from any self respecting restaurant.  The food was admittedly pretty good, and the cheesecake is fabulous.  But the menu that is more hardback novel than well thought out collection of dishes, loaded with glossy advertisements is just too much for me. The marble floors and huge columns also make it feel like they are trying too hard to be upscale, louring people who can't really afford the high prices for pedestrian food but do so anyway because they want to go out for a 'nice dinner'.  The food is okay, but i'd rather go someplace else."
Mary S.,"Fremont, CA",66,88,,5.0,1/15/2008,"I read all the bad reviews this place had gotten due to bad service and was a little leary of going but it was bf's mom's birthday and that's the place she wanted to go so... My first impression was Wow a little over the top on the decor but fun at the same time. We were a party of ten which made me think the service wouldn't be good to begin with. I have to say I was happily proved wrong. Our server Carina was attentive, knowledgeable and funny to boot. Our orders were taken quickly and our drinks were broght without delay. Here is  what we ordered and what my fellow diners rated the dishes: Fire-roasted artichoke-4 Shepherd pie-4 (a little salty) Meatloaf-4 (only because he said his was better) Mahi-4 Madeira-4 Shrimp/Crab Salad-5 Chicken Salad-5 Chicken Garlic Pasta-3 (noodles were cold)(however chicken was 5) Hungarian Goulash-5 Orange Chicken 4 (rice was dry) Chicken/biscuits-4 We ordered almost 10 different kinds of cheesecake from pineapple upside-down to original w/chambord poured over it. Everyone was deliriously happy and wanted to give 10 stars. Now while this was a lovely meal with few negatives I was going to give it 4 stars. But then our server went the extra mile. My bf's mom doesn't get around very well so when we go out she has this chair with wheeels (not exactly a wheelchair) Well, we had to leave it on the other side of the restaurant by the entrance. So, I go to get the chair as we are getting ready to leave out the side door. Here comes our server with the chair. She had gone over and gotten it for us. So 5 stars for extra effort."
Stephanie L.,"Santa Cruz, CA",1,18,3,2.0,9/29/2008,"Cheesecake Factory = Elephant Bar On A Mediocre Day I have yet to figure out what the attraction is for this place. The menu is crazy-making (793 pages of menu items, ALL OF WHICH ARE TITLED ""SPECIALTIES"") and 976 pages of ads for things like ""Lovopoly"" ...(and a helpful ad for the web site where you can RE-PERUSE the ads that you saw in the menu. Which has to be a contender for Dumbest Use of The Internet, Ever.) On a recent visit (a work lunch, where I didn't choose the venue) I undertook a futile effort to keep the calories down, and ordered a weight-management item. I was able to identify this because in the menu it was called ""WEIGHT MANAGEMENT CHICKEN SALAD."" I was envisioning a bed of greens, topped with some generous slices of grilled chicken. Here's what I got: A platter of greens so enormous that resembled a month's output from the Central Valley. Where the hell's the chicken?  After plowing through the lettuce I was able to locate a handful of thumb-sized chunks of chicken. This is a joke, right? Weight-management accomplished. But: why are you at the Cheesecake Factory if you care about your weight, she asked? Is this so you can justify the 7 pound brick of butterfat and cocoa you're planning to gob down for dessert? If you want cheesecake, you can pick up a slice or two to go. That's what I'd do. The cheesecake is actually pretty good.   But Lord, no more lunches there, please."
Elizabeth C.,"Redwood City, CA",2,18,,3.0,4/11/2008,"Ehh... That sums up my experience at Cheesecake Factory.  I'm not sure why people in college always made such a big deal about eating here, perhaps it was uber fancy compared to dorm food. The wait is always long, the food mediocre, and the cheesecake is overpriced.  If you're really in the mood for their cheesecake, go to the frozen aisle at Costco."
Jen M.,"South San Francisco, CA",12,172,2,2.0,4/5/2008,"Went here last week with some co-workers.  I was actually pretty excited about it - I hadn't been in years, and the last time I went, it was at the one in SF above Macys.   I was really excited about ordering spinach artichoke dip (I mean seriously...who WOULDN'T love a heart attack bowl of bubbly cheese, spinach and artichoke?).  BUT....major disappointment.  It seemed like a heated up bowl of frozen chopped spinach with a few artichoke hearts thrown in.  The warm chips were great, but this dip just SUCKED MONKEY BALLS.  It used to be so good.... For dinner, I got my usual BBQ chicken salad.  Again, disappointment.  Way too much dressing with way too little flavor.  I don't know what the deal was - maybe the Palo Alto one just sucks at cooking, and the SF one is still good?  I'll have to go back to the SF soon to find out."
