Steph M.,"San Francisco, CA",109,256,157,1.0,11/5/2007,"HELL. FKING. NO. Never. setting. foot. in. here. again. ...... not when the fcking waiter spilled water down my back (into my pants, shattering glass on the floor, in front of coworkers, laughing waiters, no help, no apology, no comp).  no fcuking way."
Chuck N.,"Washington, DC",182,832,2677,4.0,6/18/2009,"Have only been here Fridays/Saturdays 7:00PM and after for dinner. I like this Cheesecake Factory more than the one in SF because, well, all the food is identical but without the ridiculously long waiting time! Our party of 6+ have been here when it's hustlin' and bustlin' yet the wait is never longer than 10-15 minutes. Final Call: *Good food      -brought out appropriately (people got their entrées at the same time)       and timely (not a huge lag between ordering and receiving). *Responsive service      -not bilks about the bread and consistent with replenishing beverages *A convenient place to grub when pub/club hopping in downtown Palo Alto afterwards."
Glen M.,"Palo Alto, CA",9,67,,1.0,4/28/2007,"Imagine you went to a foreign country and saw a 7-11 but it was a giant mansion with overly-slick accent lighting and decor, staffed by people wearing fancy suits and posh attitudes. Imagine then that you went in, were seated after much delay, and served a $50 main course which turned out to be a giant pile of the same crap you'd eaten at the 7-11 back home. That's what it's like coming to The Cheesecake Factory. To continue the analogy, a pile of hotdogs might not be a bad thing (actually: mmm!), but when they're dressed up in such pretense, the gleeful junk-food anticipation oh-so-easily turns to crushing disappointment."
Setareh N.,"Redwood City, CA",45,142,1,2.0,8/21/2007,"Im not happy at all....... back in October we came here and the place was great...... last weekend it was a disaster. All i wanted was a nice delicious salad...... We enter, there are three people behind the host/ess desk....we are ignored. I say hello, we are still ignored. really? are you kidding me right now...... we keep standing there and my BF and I had an open discussion on the fact we were being ignored in front of them. I seriously thought i finally got my Powers of being invisible but FINALLY a man saw us and brought us over to the smallest table [practically in the lap of these 4 old women.........there was a table on the other side that offered us 1.7 more feet of privacy but we were not allowed to sit there......hmmmmm because we were only two people and not four? I asked the man is there anywhere else you can seat us? No....then he mumbled something and walked away. ok....fine..... then two minutes later he comes back and seat an elderly couple at the table we wanted..... thanks man! really thanks! our server was fine but honestly by the point it came to order we were already annoyed and did not want to stay..... Im honestly never going back.......there are other restaurants in PA  I can go to"
Mario L.,"Sunnyvale, CA",7,93,,3.0,6/5/2009,"I'm not usually a fan of these sorts of overpriced chain restaurants but this one isn't that bad. The food is usually pretty good and while I'm not such a big fan of over-the-top cheesecakes, the original is pretty good. For me it isn't cheesecake if it doesn't have graham-cracker crust. At first I thought it was way to pricey. But if you split an entree and a slice of cheesecake it is actually pretty cheap. And since the servings are so huge, splitting a meal is more than enough food."
Naomi S.,"San Jose, CA",0,34,4,2.0,6/4/2013,"never come here if you want your to-go food in a timely manner.. this has been my second experience where i order lunch for my company and the food hasn't been ready when they said it would. If they say it will be ready in 20 minutes, expect to wait at least another 20-30 minutes on top of that... why order to-go at all if it will take the same amount of time to sit there and eat.. and forget ordering for company functions because it will never be prepared in time and you will have everyone at work sitting there wondering what's taking so long.. you would think that in a neighborhood surrounded by businesses, a timely turn around would be important.. guess not.. now i'll boycott this for another year.. guess that's what i get for trying them again.."
David S.,"Roseville, CA",6,45,,1.0,4/25/2014,"Haven't even gone there but giving it one star due poorly written catering menu and frustratingly incompetent staff. Emailed General Manager (GM) regarding catering for my wedding based on a friend's recommendation from his experience last year working with GM Ed Miller. Three days later called by an employee during the dinner rush who thought the $220, 4 dish package would feed 12 people, though friend clearly said it would feed 32-40. (Menu states 8-10 and did not specify if it was per dish or for the package, though ordering individually each $50-70 plate will serve 6-8, so obviously $220 to serve 12 is wrong both based on the menu and logic.) Stunned so told her I would look at the menu again and call back. Called back and was told GM my friend worked with left a year ago and that this other employee would get the GM for me. Put on hold for 10 minutes with several people picking up the line and asking if I had been helped. GM finally arrived and gave the same wrong answer until I talked him through it and he admitted the $220 package would feed 30 people. I am disappointed because I was really looking forward to working with CCF for catering my wedding reception, and I understand that it was during your dinner rush, but I really question the competency of the staff and am obviously reluctant to entrust my wedding to that."
Ahmed S.,"Alameda, CA",96,327,,3.0,4/6/2009,"Now I love Cheesecake Factory and this place totally lives up to standards. I have had my bad experiences here but I keep coming back.  Food is good, never been dissapointed. Portions are huge, service is good for the most part, but have met servers with their odd days.  Be prepared to wait on a popular night. They have actually responded to the downturn in the economy and have introduced not so expensive and not so massive dishes. I definitely like this location a lot more than the other two in the south bay. Better service than the one in SF too. Also, great hours, open till midnight.  Loses stars for the following: A) Have had a couple of horrible servers B) Bread is served cold half the time C) No reservation policy - this is nationwide, kind of a pain D) It is good, just does not have the OMG factor E) Kind of pricey, look at least $20 - $30 per person, a lot of great places in the bay area for slightly less Still a default place when in Palo Alto and confused on where to go. Recommend."
Olma M.,"South San Francisco, CA",295,395,704,3.0,7/26/2007,"OK, to justify my nightly jaunts to the Stanford Theatre after a long, hard day at work, and driving down all this way on a weeknight for more than just a classic film on the big screen... well, I don't really need any more justification, but I need a reason to explain my back-to-back visits of the Cheesecake Factory this week! Despite the horrendous, and I mean horrendous, service last night... Ummm, what do you mean you ran out of the rectangular containers for the sugar so you're just presenting us with a sloppily arranged medley of sugar and splenda in a shallow bowl!?!   And why would you just let us sit there and wait for us to ask for some bread when, clearly, every table is offered this option from the start!?!   And what do you mean, you ""RAN OUT OF BUTTER!?!""  What type of restaurant, let alone the Cheesecake Factory, runs out of butter at any given time when they provide complimentary bread!?! ... I returned to this joint because ultimately, the Thai Lettuce Wraps and Spring Rolls - along with their sauces (!) - kept me longing for more.   Tonight, Raoul, our efficient, professional and friendly server made up for all the shortcomings of the night before.  Bread, check.  Butter, check!  And the Avocado rolls - TO DIE FOR.  Not only am I addicted to the nearby Stanford Theatre now, but at least 3 of the CF's appetizers will enhance this addiction. *The Banana Cream cheesecake tonight also helped. I'll need a few more experiences here to improve the 3 star rating."

Eric C.,"Palo Alto, CA",276,265,32,3.0,11/30/2008,"Its a cheesecake factory.  Heavily sauced 'asian fusion', mediocre pasta, and 8 dollar burgers. *shrug* so why do me and Stephanie keep coming back? Damn Avocado Egg Rolls.  They're too addictingly good.. and free bread. Yee!"
Vivian M.,"Mountain View, CA",14,7,,5.0,6/15/2010,"I'm usually not a big fan of franchises, but but they do have a HUGE menu. The chain itself is a great place to take a large group - or even a small group of people who all want something different. They have Mexican, Chinese, Salads, Roast Beef, you name it, they have something you want.."
Desmond Y.,"Stanford, CA",0,8,,2.0,10/4/2011,"I never understood why Cheesecake Factory has such a huge menu that offers everything from pizza to orange chicken with a little jambalaya, fried chicken, and steak diane on the side.  Come here to fill up on calories before getting shipped off to a 30-day fast on a deserted island.  Look elsewhere for actual food."
Janie A.,"Redwood City, CA",7,63,,1.0,7/16/2007,"I don't know why I still agree to go to this place, since every single time, without fail, I am severely disappointed in the food, service, bathroom, etc.  Everything about this place is just bad, but in the spirit of intelligent, thoughtful reviews, I'll try to be more specific. First, I have stopped ordering cocktails at any Cheesecake Factory, including this one.  After returning THREE vodka gimlets at the store in SF (at the top of Macy's), the bartender came to my table and explained that they are obligated, by corporate, to follow strict recipes for all cocktails, and are not allowed to deviate from the formula.  Okay, that's fine; now that I understand the rules, no more cocktails at Cheesecake Factory. The food, however, is another story.  I think the visit today put me over the edge.  Each time I have gone to the Palo Alto store, I've ordered a salad.  And each time I order a salad, I request the dressing on the side - super simple, right?.  This is the ONLY request I make (since I'm not ordering cocktails anymore, I'm a fairly low-maintenance patron).  Well, every single time, the salad comes with the dressing already on it.  Which, I really wouldn't complain too much about, since I already have low expectations, but they use too much dressing, and I'm a bit of a veggie lover, so I like to experience the crunch of the greens without the soppiness of the dressing. A few other ""action items"" they could improve on, such as: food taking 45 minutes to come to the table, rude bartenders, incompetent wait staff, stale bread, dirty bathrooms, and a long wait (okay maybe THIS one they can't control). . . I always say yes when my friends or family want to go there, just because I hate to be the one who has to have things my way, but I guess I've just experienced so many other places with such amazing food and great service that I actually dread going to Cheesecake Factory.  Might be time to ""just say no.""  One more thing. . .the enormous variety in the menu means that *nothing* they do is actually that good.  Everything is mediocre, including the cheesecake.  In fact, I think the only reason people still go there for the cheesecake is that they just don't want to make it themselves in their own kitchen, not that I blame them!"
Lisa L.,"San Jose, CA",68,61,15,3.0,1/5/2010,"Ok...so I came here about two weeks ago with a few friends from work. Here's the breakdown of the good, the bad and the ugly:  The good: *Menu is huge! Pretty much anything you can think of to eat, you can find on their menu. There's certainly no lack of options. I've been to the CF three times and every time I've been, I've been pleasantly surprised with the taste of what they serve.  *Wait staff is fairly accommodating...but more on that later.  The bad:  *Value. Not really there. You're definitely paying for, what I'm sure they think, is an experience. However, they are highly overpriced for what they offer. The food is good, don't get me wrong; it's just not $18 for some teriyaki chicken good. Hence the reason I have an issue with their pricing. For the four of us to eat, getting three cocktails total (not a piece), our bill was close to $160. I didn't think the food and/or service warranted a bill quite that sizeable.  *They don't take reservations. Mind you, I had an ""in"" so I was able to arrange for my friends and I to get a reservation but I was irked at the fact that I had to use my ""in"" rather than just call and get a reservation. They'd earn brownie points in my book if they allowed people to at least use call-ahead seating. Unfortunately, they don't.  *Parking in downtown PA is a pain in the ass! Luckily, the parking gods were smiling upon us that night but I can tell you from experience that it doesn't happen very often. The ugly: *Number one pet peeve of CF? AD'S in their menu! Are you kidding me? Not only am I paying to eat at your restaurant but I have to also be bombarded with ads for shit I don't need and/or want? Um...I think not. Super annoying....and classless!  *Ok.....so as mentioned above, the wait staff is fairly accommodating. The server we had the last time was friendly, patient with us when it took us about half an hour to figure out what we wanted to eat and was mostly attentive during service. However, he was clearly not the brightest bulb in the box. I think he was under the impression that his boyish good looks alone would earn him a huge tip but hey...news flash...I'm not impressed. What will impress me is if you keep my drinks topped off, fill my order correctly and provide gracious service. Your charming little smile only goes so far. But that seems to be the general idea of the staff: they're just too good looking to work for their money. That point was only proven when we had to listen to two waiters talking about how ugly and stupid a third waiter was. Wow...I totally missed that section of my professional training: how to talk shit about someone else while simultaneously making yourself look like the douche bag! *They couldn't even admit that they made a mistake and take personal responsibility. I have a HUGE issue with organizations that are of the ""pass-the-buck"" mindset. When our waiter asked us if we wanted to take our leftovers, of course our answers were ""yes"". So when our food didn't come back after 20 minutes, we started getting a little curious. I pretty much knew that he had thrown it away on accident (probably because he wasn't paying attention when we said we wanted it) but he didn't want to admit it. Instead, he re-fired the food (which was nice) but blamed the other food disappearing on someone else. Who cares whose fault it is? Just get me new food! Simple as that. So there ya have it. Definitely worth checking out with friends for a night out but I'd make it an occasional treat and definitely not a place I'd frequent."
Tracy A.,"San Francisco, CA",278,324,144,4.0,4/7/2008,"I've only been here twice and both experiences were mediocre.  The cheesecakes are great here...well duh its the cheesecake factory! I guess I wouldn't feel too guilty if I don't order an entree  and just get the cheesecake or not get cheesecake and just get an entree BUT what's the point of going to the cheesecake factory without getting cheesecake right? haha.  I would recommend to get a pasta though, probably tastes better than pasta p =XX"
Al Q.,"Redwood City, CA",4,55,18,3.0,3/21/2009,"The Cheesecake Factory is The Cheesecake Factory no matter where you go. The food is always good no matter what you order and cheesecakes are to die for of course!  Unfortunately I found hair in my food once, and it made me loose my appetite. The manager comp. us for that meal, and sent over another one, but by then I still didn't want it. (Whatever happened to hair nets?) When you are cooking for such a huge restaurant, you probably want to enforce that on your chefs.  All in All, food is always good. I would probably still go there, just have to look over my food maybe once or twice."
Rosalind S.,"San Francisco, CA",252,737,237,3.0,1/31/2011,"I don't expect too much but when I ask for my dressing on the side and it comes mixed in I see that as a bad sign.  And the rice in my Spicy chicken salad was hard, hard like day old, oh heck, probably two day old rice.  I know this because I'm Asian and I know what happens when you cook too much rice and you don't eat it.  The bread is good, as usual.  And I finally got to try the cheese cake!  We ordered the Adam's peanut butter one and the dulce de leches one.  Both were great but the dulce de leches was definitely creamier and easier to eat.  The chunks of chocolate and peanuts butter swirled with caramel in the Adam's cake was a little too much to polish off in one sitting so I took it home."
S U.,"San Jose, CA",4,71,,5.0,6/16/2009,"Met up with my friend here to catch up and chismiss!  haha!   She was about 30 min late, leaving me to sit alone.  Thank goodness my waiter was very nice and accommodating.  I went on a Tuesday when American Idol was still on...so I was kind of on a time constraint.  Even though my friend hadn't arrived yet, I ordered (already knew what she was getting) so that by the time she got there, we could start eating. Very happy that our waiter didn't ignore me just because my table wasn't complete.  Food was ready before she got there so he kindly asked if they should put the food under the light until she arrived.  Didn't even think about that.   Also, the waiter kept coming by periodically to ask if I was ok.   Very pleased with the service here!  Too bad I don't remember the name of the waiter :(   If I lived closer, I'd come more often to this location!"
Jenny D.,"North Las Vegas, NV",30,184,9,2.0,6/16/2010,"I've never really enjoyed going to this location. I prefer to drive 30 minutes to go to the location in San Jose. The wait here is always long, and I always feel so cramped. The food is typical of all Cheesecake Factories, large, over-priced, high calorie portions. The food is still standard as you could get at any other Cheesecake Factory, but the atmosphere at this location isn't as laid back as the on in San Jose."
