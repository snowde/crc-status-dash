Bianca C.,"Manhattan, NY",10,41,,3.0,4/5/2009,"My boyfriend won a $25 gift card for this place, so we checked it out. We went around 9:30-10 because they don't take reservations and during dinner on weekends it's like a 20-30 minute wait. Our four-cheese pasta was great, though our breadbasket wasn't the best; our blue cheese/endive salad was a little too bitter. The waiter seemed like he was either new or pooped at the end of his shift (he was a little clueless about our vegetarianism-- ""This dish has no meat in it, would you like a side of chicken or beef?""-- and asked us again for our dessert order), and it took a while to get our food even though the place was already thinning out. The while chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake we got was OK; but, as my boyfriend said, it ""tasted like Entemann's"", nothing special-- strange considering the restaurant's name! But it's great for a casual or semi-formal dinner and drinks in Palo Alto-- I can attest to this since sat across from their really nice bar, with ESPN playing on the two mounted tvs and gaggles of college graduates at the standing tables. It really is ""nothing special"" and the wait isn't proportional to the quality of the food, but it's still a nice place to do dinner."
Fiona S.,"Atlanta, GA",14,86,,2.0,1/8/2009,"It would be 1 star except that the cheesecake is actually pretty damn good. Major complaints - portions are waaaaaay to big. I got a Cesar salad with chicken as an entree and took what I didn't eat home with me. It turned in to 2 more meals. Second, the food just isn't that great. I could make most of it at home and it would taste the same, if not better. The service is GOD AWFUL. I think they have a propensity to hire completely inexperienced servers who have a major  ""I'm hot shit"" complex. The servers I've had are slow, incompetent, either very rude or cranky, and generally useless. When I asked for a recommendation between a few of the cheesecakes, one server just stared blankly at me and then said, ""I don't know, I don't like cheesecake."" The decor makes me want to puke - it looks like someone dropped acid and then went nuts with pastel-toned water colors and tacky over-sized moldings/fixtures. The lighting is much to dim at night and it's one of the noisiest restaurants I've ever been in. I also don't understand why two 600-square-ft rooms need 30 foot ceilings...? I think they are aiming for some snazzy, upscale vibe but missed the mark by a LOT. The only reason I ever, ever patronize Cheesecake Factory is to get cheesecake to go, which I call ahead to order, so that I only have to be in there for about 57 seconds. Don't waste your time. Go somewhere worth eating - anywhere but here will do you fine."
Chris B.,"South San Francisco, CA",35,89,39,3.0,4/2/2010,"This place is really nice looking, I feel like im in a Las Vegas hotel restuarant kinda feel.  The food is pretty good, not amazing but I have only been a few times so i havent tasted much of this place.   Its a really good place to take a date if your in PA before you hit up a bar..."
Angela L.,"Palo Alto, CA",181,110,2,1.0,4/22/2010,"I took last Thursday off and was walking past the Cheesecake Factory at 4 o'clock which happened to be happy hour. I thought it was destiny, boy was I wrong.  We sat there and there were just as many people in the restaurant as there were workers. We sat in the bar area and were stared at by a few servers. None came to take our order or offer us anything to drink for about 5 minutes just stared at us and the TV. screen. We ordered at the bar and the bar tender was nice...his blonde (Samantha B according to our receipt) counterpart...not so much. We got our drinks and brought them back to our table. Our food was brought out and finally the server asked us, ""is everything okay?"" This is after she helped the only other two tables, one that sat down after us. Then as we were almost done she asked us if we wanted anything else. I said, ""No thanks, just the check."" Was I done drinking? No, but not at a place that ignores you and then she rung us up under her name instead of the guy who took our order. I used to be a waitress and that is a no no. She never brought us food, water and just ignored us and then she put a smiley face on my receipt? I never stiff a tip, but I left her less than a dollar and I felt like change was too much to be treated this way.  We finished happy hour at Mantra where we got great service, smiles and the staff works like a team."
Superduperpooperscooper T.,"Palo Alto, CA",26,227,17,4.0,4/29/2007,"great salads!!! Luau salads are my favorite, especially the shallot vinagrette and the creamy oriental sauce they drizzled on top. As for the desserts... plain cheesecake...omg... Outrageous Chocolate Cake - yummy variety in the layers of cake, brownie, cheesecake, and coconut pecan filling. (A) crab cakes are soggy and icky."
Alex G.,"Belmont, CA",434,107,1,3.0,8/10/2007,"So I had been hearing about THE CHEESECAKE FACTORY for 3-4 years, it seems to be the place of choice for all the spoiled sorority girls I meet who go on and on about how they eat lettuce all day so they can have some cheesecake . . . . . losers. Anyways, I finally went with my boyfriend's family to check it out and damn - Cheesecake Factory food is good. Dem bitches weren't lying.  (Not that I think sorority girls are bitches, some of my best friends are in a sorority . . . .can I please make fun of them?) The menu is fairly daunting, which I don't know if that's a pro or a con, but if you can make it through all 15 pages of entree suggestions you will enjoy your meal. You can get anything from Asian/Italian/New-Agey cuisine to old-fashioned American favorites. I got some kind of pasta/shrimp meal, it was SO good, definitely high in calories, but whatever. The drinks were also pretty good, and I love the brown bread they bring out, suuuper fluffy. . . . unfortunately I was too full for cheesecake. The reason I can't give Cheesecake Factory 5 stars - the service SUCKS here. You wait forever for a waiter, wait forever to put in your order, and if they forget to bring you a sauce with your meal then forgeddabout it - you won't get it delivered till your food is cold and almost gone. I had to wait almost 10 minutes for our server to bring us a box . . .  were they hoping I'd leave my food behind . . . . I mean, I know it's good . . . .  I usually don't knock two stars based on one time of bad service, but the second time I ate there (went back by myself on a Friday afternoon) I sat at a table for 10 minutes before my server even showed . . .  and for all of you out there who have served, you know its a HUGE no-no to leave a lone guest twiddling her thumbs at an empty table. When my waiter finally showed, he spoke horrible English, acted like he couldn't care less, forgot a ton of stuff, and of course, it took until I was leaving for someone to show up with my side-of-blue-cheese. On top of that - I got food poisoning - from a quesadilla and a salad! (Is that possible?) The Cheesecake factory in Palo Alto looks like it should be a theater, or maybe an art museum . . . Either way, the chain must be doing pretty well to afford buildings that look this nice. Too bad they don't put that money into staffing - I'd rather have good service than a pretty place to sit and wait."
Kim F.,"Sunnyvale, CA",27,120,,3.0,4/12/2006,"The food's pretty good, but the wait is ridiculous on weekends - my friends and I once waited 1 hr and 45 minutes for a table for 4. And they don't take reservations. Their cheesecake's good, but not the best I've had, and for the price, it's not really worth it.  You can get their cheesecake in the frozen dessert aisle at Costco for 13 bucks for an entire pie :P Also, every time I go to a Cheesecake Factory, I feel a little bit sold out. Why do they have ads on every other page of their menu? I can take ads in my menu in little hole-in-the-wall places; they need to make a few extra bucks, I understand.  But when it's at a huge chain like Cheesecake, and the ads are for like, Cartier watches and crap, it definitely cheapens them."
Tony L.,"San Mateo, CA",257,116,,1.0,10/28/2007,"I got to this place for brunch at around 12 noon.  I was pretty excited to eat here because the one in SF would always be about an hour wait for a table for 2.  Once I got in, the decor looked very nice, but thats where it all ended.  Service...terrible.  The party of 3 who entered with us through the door at the same time got drinks and bread 15 minutes before we even got service.  We got seated around 12ish.  did not get a waitress until a little over 12:15.  did not get our drinks until 12:25.  did not get bread until 12:30.  did not get our food until 12:45.   45 minutes just to get food is terrible!  if i wanted terrible service, i would have gone to California Pizza Kitchen in Hillsdale (read my review for reference).  The waitress was the dumbest blonde ever.  I ordered the Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta and she wrote down chicken sandwich.  We told her 3 times that we wanted bread.  She never asked if we wanted water until half way through our lunch.  Only once did she even come over to ask how we were doing...and when she did, we were already done with our meal. After reading all the bad reviews of terrible service at this place...it makes you wonder why management hasnt done anything to improve the service.  Especially since Cheesecake factory isn't a type of restaurant that doesnt care about appearances. to summarize my review in a few short words..... DO NOT GO HERE.  YOU WILL BE WASTING YOUR MONEY AND TIME. this place totally ruined my day.  when we went in...IT WASNT EVEN BUSY! no excuse!  if i could give 0 stars, I definately would."
Niket B.,"New York, NY",491,110,59,4.0,5/28/2010,"order: miso salmon, thai chicken pasta veg: tomato basil pasta (no chicken), brown bread i've been here 100 times. it's chainy. it's nice and classy. they serve you well (though they don't take reservations on the phone). they're open til 11. and they have delicious cheesecake (the original, strawberry, tiramisu and godiva are my favs). what more could you really want?"
Luk S.,"San Jose, CA",0,76,,1.0,1/29/2012,"We have gone to this cheesecake factory several times by now and sadly they deserve no more than one star.  Their food has always been so-so, but lately their service has gone downhill as well.  Our last visit was memorable, in a bad way.  We took our guests there and were totally embarrassed.  The waiter got the order wrong, the steak was overcooked eventhough it was ordered medium-rare.  Asked for water and good luck on getting one.  Those are just among few examples.  On top of that, their price do not represent the food you're getting.  Try avoid going there unless you want to get a hole on your wallet without satisfying your stomach."
Eve K.,"Sunnyvale, CA",415,1169,1081,4.0,3/4/2008,"If I'm gonna go with a chain restaurant, this is my one of choice. The menu alone is HUGE. We discovered the chain in college and have been excited when they started opening them closer to us every since.  I've rarely had a meal I disliked (and I've had a bunch. Some of my faves: - Chicken costaletta: flat lightly breaded fried chicken in a creamy lemony sauce - Avocado egg rolls: LOTS of avocado wrapped in a fried casing ;-) - Chicken madiera: great sauce, cheese, and asparagus - Fresh fish: when I was on a strict diet, this was one of the only dishes I could eat out and not feel like I was being held hostage to the restrictions. Just plain, fresh, good fish with steamed broccoli - BBQ chicken salad: I just like BBQ sauce on my salad. Makes me feel like I'm not missing out on the good stuff when I go the healthy route. - Hamburgers: I don't know what it is but the sliders and the entree hamburger on the dark bread rolls are oddly enough some of the best burgers I've had. - Cocktail list: Some fun martinis like the strawberry one where they muddle strawberries into it and the bikini one with pineapple juice. - Cheesecakes: You'd be scared if you knew how many types I've had--it's probably easier to note the kinds I haven't tried. I went through a fierce cheesecake phase a few years ago. ;-) My faves are: pineapple upside down cake, german chocolate, and Kahlua.   I usually have good service, good food, and overall good experiences here so I keep coming back."
Julia S.,"Palo Alto, CA",45,8,12,1.0,8/3/2010,"The dishes are NOT clean. A while back, I sent a wine glass back because when I picked it up you could feel the grit on the glass. I wrote the manager and said he needed to get the dishwasher fixed. He called me and said they'd take care of it. Since then I've gone back and run my fingers over my plate and a knife. Still gritty. YUK. I'm giving up on this place."
VERONICA B.,"Hayward, CA",5,48,,5.0,3/24/2011,The best food and service. I love the fresh bread with butter. Try the Chicken Madera its awesome
Josh L.,"Alameda, CA",90,602,5,3.0,10/20/2008,"We were in Palo Alto one Sunday afternoon and super hungry.  My iphone yelp app wasn't working well so we didn't know where to go.  We chose Cheesecake Factory.  The avacado rolls are money, they are really really good.  I decided to try the Kobe Beef Burger.  I remember watching FoodTV where people in NY pay $100 for a real kobe beef burger and it melts in your mouth.  Yeah, not here.  As I learned afterwards, it's not Kobe Beef from Japan.  It is Kobe-Like Hamburger meaning a cow here in American that is fed the same way as Japan.  The burger was just okay.  I wouldn't have it again.  Barney's and Val's make very good juicy regular hamburgers.  Learned my lesson to research before you go to University Ave.  We could have gone to Plutos :)"
D C.,"Mountain View, CA",1,72,1,1.0,5/18/2008,"Cheesecake Factory is what you get when an ignorant populace decides that quantity == quality.  Every time I'm in downtown Palo Alto and I see people waiting for a table here, I can only roll my eyes.  If you live in the middle of nowhere, where the best food you can get is at the Olive Garden, then maybe (but only MAYBE) is it excusable to get dinner here.  When you live in the Bay Area with its plethora of fantastic restaurants that are cheaper and better tasting, you should only be eating here when your redneck family from back east is here and thinks that this a nice fancy place to go. The food is the real crown jewel at this restaurant.  The menu is massive, and the portions are massive.  The thing is, they don't seem to be able to make good food.  It's all bland.  There's a lot of it on the serving platters they use as dinner plates, but it's got all of the flavor of the dry toast that my grandmother used to feed me when I was sick. And then it's dessert time.  The real horror of the menu lies here.  The cheesecakes start at 700 calories per slice, with other desserts topping 1500 calories each.  For all of those calories, you'd think that you'd get something decadent.  No, you're not even getting something that could be considered a little bit nice.  It's just greasy and overly sweet."
Ksjusha V.,"Mountain View, CA",0,1,,1.0,7/18/2012,"I'm not going back to this place. I'll try other location but not Palo Alto. My Tataki Tuna salad was old, over cooked(tuna) and smaller in portion. After I complained a little, had a chance to talk to Marrisa (manager), but she wasn't helpful. She actually told me that salad looks fine to her, she made me feel like I'm exaggerating. I showed her old avocado on my plate, and she agreed to change for fresh 3 slices of avocado, how about for the rest of our food. My husband also had overcooked pasta. I don't like to complain, but feel that I should worn you."
Nicole W.,"Pinole, CA",42,200,18,4.0,3/30/2010,This place is sooooo good! I love the red velvet cheesecake and the more tradition cheesecakes too. The wait here is usually a lot less than the one in the city and if you come after about 9pm you are usually seated right away. Great place to get dessert.
Brooke R.,"Bay Area, CA",530,962,32,2.0,6/8/2007,"I wish they hadn't built this here.  Cheesecake Factory belongs in low-class-trying-to-be-high-class malls. The food at this chain is gross....this one was no different.  But the cheesecake is alright.  If your University St restaurant that you're at isn't serving cheesecake and you really want cheesecake, walk over here after your meal."
Zoller G.,"Mountain View, CA",0,2,3,5.0,2/11/2012,"A great place I fell in love with the first time I visited with a friend. This week I decided to celebrate my birthday in Cheesecake Factory in Palo Alto. I had medium rare Hibachi steak both times, which I loved."
Leo T.,"Belmont, CA",148,478,,5.0,3/29/2011,"This is a great restaurant. As dessert is my favorite part of any meal,the Red Velvet Cheesecake with extra whipped cream and hot fudge is my favorite dish,as I love chocolate too. The main meal was also excellent. Don't leave Palo Alto without eating here."
