Anthony B.,"San Juan, Puerto Rico",75,40,22,4.0,5/3/2011,"Nice portions of food, but then you don't have space for the most important thing.  THE CHEESECAKE !!!"
JAYCE B.,"Burlingame, CA",74,260,7,3.0,3/11/2007,"I like Cheesecake Factory. Ever the eternal optimist I try to give most places an honest ""go,"" but time and time again I found that the meals to be exceedingly ordinary and manifested at least one deal-breaking, undesirable trait. Be it too much dressing, not enough this, too much that, sickly sweet or heavily salty. I tried, people, and for what it is worth I've dropped more than my fair share of a pretty penny here. The menu is ok, no stand out home runs but something for everyone to kinda be pleased. Does anyone else have trouble relating to or establishing the relevance of the Egyptian decor circa 5th century BC?"
Mary C.,"Atherton, CA",0,1,,1.0,6/26/2012,"Enjoyed going to the CF until  recently. The service absolutley awful.  Our waitress didn't get the orders rigth, I think a language barrier and then we had to wait for an hour for our food.  Out of 5 dishes 2  were wrong, the manger who i think needs to go back to managerial school said he would take care of us. Well when we got the bill, took off the fish tacos when we ordered fish & chips, which we never got, but charged us a higher fee for a piece of salmon and ceasar salad when we ordered slamon, vegs, & potatoes which was less expensive. Then when we go to leave the waitress gave us take home bags with the food upside down and then wait..the best... caesar salad to take home when we didn't ask for it...are they trying to make us sick, who ever heard of take home caesar salad, especially on a Saturday night when you are probably not going home right away.    Highly do not recommnend at least this location. 6/23/12"
Michelle N.,"San Mateo, CA",261,104,107,4.0,10/29/2006,"Does their entrance look like an upside down cake on a brown platter? I always get the Chicken madeira-- it never fails.  Its always been my favorite dish and it will always be.  The last time I came here was for my birthday, and the cheesecake I had was SOOo deliishh.  It would just... melt in my  mouth.  I wish I remember what it was (maybe chocolate & coffee in it?) because oh man I would have ordered that again! Anyways, two nights ago we went with a party of 25.  holy moly, it took us over 2 hours to get the table!  (I knew it would happen).  We got there at 9pm, and we didn't sit down until 11, ate at 11:15 or so.  The waitress was the one that made our party worthwhile.  Since our table was so large, and they were still waiting for a bunch of ladies to leave, instead of being uncomforatable and squishing into the table, a group of us four were able to sit at a booth across from our party, still making us connected, but somewhat separate.  She ordered our food for us (awesome chick) BEFORE the rest of the party, just because we were starving at 11pm, with no dinner in our stomachs.  Like every waitress, she made sure everything was okay with our food.  Let  me tell you though, our party was a party of 25... for a 21st birthday.  And you know what happens for 21st birthdays...Anyways, we had a fender bender and a whole lot of lovelies splattered all over the floor!  When our waitress came over, (you would expect her to be surprised, pissed, etc) she came with a smile and asked if he was okay, and if he needed anything like more water.  *WOW SUPER PROFESSIONAL, good move*  our friend was fine, he was just upset because he wasted his dinner.   Anyways, since we did get good service, she definitely earned her reward.  I would come back because not only the food wasnt so bad, the service was more than extraordinary for us."
Elaine S.,"San Francisco, CA",198,442,16,1.0,8/18/2007,"This place is like Las Vegas; gaudy, unhealthy and overpriced! First of all, the ceiling of the place gets lighter and darker and it kind of reminds me of Caesar's Palace in Vegas, although not as cool. The menu is a million pages long (OK, not a million, but literally like 20) and it has advertisements in it, WTF! I don't think I am going to go to a restaurant and decide I'd rather buy a diamond tennis bracelet instead of eating dinner. You can order anything from Mexican food to pasta to fried chicken at this place, which means nothing is going to taste really good. The portions are HUGE, each entree makes about three meals with the leftovers! The prices may seem high, but in reality, it is cheap if you are getting three meals! The bar has a wide selection of drinks that are actually pretty good, although they don't have much alcohol in them and they are expensive. The two things that I like here are the cheesecake (which has a million calories) and the dark bread that they bring you, but other than that, the cheesecake factory is the reason America is fat!"
Nat S.,"Fremont, CA",0,6,,5.0,5/27/2013,"We recently had a very large event catered by the Palo Alto Cheesecake Factory.  Service was excellent throughout the entire process, and Ed was great to work with.  Even when we ran low on food (twice I believe), the Cheesecake Factory was to the rescue.  I would readily cater again through the Palo Alto Cheesecake Factory."
Jane D.,"Fremont, CA",203,604,8,3.0,8/3/2006,"Carb addicts in search of their next fix, search no more, you can find it at The Cheese Cake Factory. The starchy portions are way big here. I never get a chance to sample the cheese cakes because I am so full after my meal. I ordered the Shrimp Scampi and my Fiance ordered the pulled pork sandwich. Neither of us cleaned our plates.   The best way to eat here is to go in with a strategy. Share an entree with your partner and then order a dessert.  Other than that, the place was clean, we were seated in 10 minutes. Granted this was Thursday night. Who knows how long we would have had to wait on the weekends.  I would have to agree that it is noisy here. But there is enough space between tables that you don't feel like you're listening to other people conversations. I think its the back ground music that is really loud. That could be turned down a notch."
Nine N.,"San Jose, CA",50,212,315,4.0,10/4/2010,"this review is for their sunday brunch menu, which ends at 2pm. it's VERY tasty, and inexpensive. i had the buttermilk pancakes with hash on the side and coffee.  everything was cooked to perfection, fast and attentive service, our waiter was awesome.  perfect sunday brunch :)  still thinking of the buttermilk pancakes - tastes much better than ihops pancakes imho. pancakes and hash filled me up so much that i just couldn't think of ordering their godiva cheesecake (although i did have that in mind for dessert) - but i just couldn't.  the portion size of the 4 stacked pancakes plus generous amount of hot golden hash browns were enough to keep me satisfied til dinner. the only thing about this cheesecake factory location is the parking.  high traffic so you have to drive around and around looking for somewhere convenient to location to park."
Tony D.,"Los Altos, CA",62,203,,2.0,7/22/2008,"In June 08, my wife and I joined our friends to celebrate their recent engagement.  Unfortunately, we were stuck with some lame ass waiter who looked like he just wanted his shift to be over.   We mentioned to him that we were there to celebrate our friends' engagement, and he said, ""well I hope it's one of those marriages that last.""   It did not end with that.  He also said that he was tired, and he had to act nice to get tips from his patrons.  There were other examples of his sarcasm, but I don't feel the need to list them. I was so angry that not only did I cut his tip in half, I complained to the corporate office about this guy.  They were very apologetic and reprimanded that ass of a waiter and mailed me a $25 gift certificate.   I was happy that the management took care of this matter.  I usually don't have bad experiences at Cheesecake Factory.  I just got stuck with a guy who was obviously not happy to work there."
Rachel R.,"Cool, CA",372,1059,12,4.0,1/23/2006,"If you're willing to brave the wait, The Cheesecake Factory offers a ridiculously huge menu that's fun for people who haven't eaten there before.  The dishes are also large, so sharing is great idea.  An appetiser can easily be your entire meal.  The drinks are fabulous, especially the Lemon Sunburst.  Parking is a real drag at this location. Vegan Report:  The Cheesecake Factory has surprisingly few options.  Besides the bruschetta, I love the Chinese Chicken Salad without the chicken (or for a more reasonably priced and sized salad, I get the Traditional Tossed Green Salad wtih the Chinese plum dressing and I ask them to add rice noodles).  They have several good pastas and the veggie burger without cheese is decent.  I also always ask about the soup of the day in the off chance it is vegan.  Note that their Asian Stir Fry isn't vegetarian, because it has fish sauce in it."
Michelle W.,"Daly City, CA",225,280,4,3.0,4/2/2007,"I'm not gonna lie.  I like Cheesecake Factory - it's my favorite of all chain type restaurants.  The food is reliable, portions are ginormous, and the cheesecake... yum!  But I don't come here expecting excellent service or food that just blows me away.  I come here for my usual: Fried Calamari, Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes, Cajun Chicken Littles, Peach Bellini, Meatloaf, Clam Chowder, and Cheesecake.    The service can definitely suck sometimes.  They're so busy, it takes forever for everything.  The complimentary bread is good only when served warm.  Most of the time, it's cold. Although it's amusing when you notice the type of clientele that come here.  I sat next to a tatted up old man with a bluetooth in his ear drinking his ""Hefferweizer"" beer accompanied with his wife who wanted to know if the fish and chips were good followed by their skater fitted grandson.  Before they arrived, it was a family of four where the mom suggested making time capsules for thanksgiving.  Awesome!"
Chuck K.,"Palo Alto, CA",0,4,,1.0,4/29/2012,We (two kids and one adult) went to the Cheesecake Factory for lunch today and the service was extremely slow.  It took about 20 minutes before a waiter took our order and then another 20 minutes before the food arrived.  The food tasted O.K.  I do not recommend this place.
Anna R.,"Moraga, CA",6,72,,1.0,12/26/2007,"I don't want to like it (thus the reason for 1 star), but I can't resist an item on CCF's menu called Buffalo Blasts. This is the most unhealthy item you can order at CCF, however my friend Big Al (my BB partner in crime, who in fact is very skinny) and I indulged in a plate of these deep fried chunks of spicey goodness once and haven't been able to reisist since. Buffalo Blasts are described as:  BUFFALO BLASTS  Chicken Breast, Cheese and Our Spicy Buffalo Sauce all Stuffed in a Spiced Wrapper and Fried until Crisp. Served with Celery Sticks and Blue Cheese Dressing Don't forget the side salad!"
grant f.,"New York, NY",7,26,,5.0,3/22/2008,"I'm reviewing this Cheesecake Factory in relation to the other dining choices on University Avenue in downtown Palo Alto; this particular one is an island compared to it's franchise brethren. I work within throwing distance to this place.  Often, I have lunch meetings with people (""let's do lunch"") and once we step out on the ave the conversation goes like this: me: ""So, what are you in the mood for?"" them: ""Oh, I don't know.  What are my choices?"" me: ""well, there are plenty of cuisine choices on University.  There's Thai, Italian, Jordanian, quasi-Mexican--"" them: ""--you know what, it doesn't matter.  You pick."" me: ""Cheesecake Factory it is."" The food isn't ground shaking, but it isn't offensive either.  If you want a healthy choice, go grilled chicken medallions and substitute the rice for broccoli.  If you have no regard for your health, try the pasta da vinci.  The booths in the back are big enough so that you can have a super-secret meeting and nobody can eavesdrop.  The wait staff is hit or miss, but they never fail to keep my drink full or offer me cheesecake at the end. Speaking of the cheesecake, it is yummy, it is decadent, it is overpriced, but sometimes you gotta have a slice.  Navigate with caution."
Cindy W.,"Burlingame, CA",307,707,47,3.0,9/11/2010,"for those who know me, friends know i honestly like Cheesecake Factory. it has a nostalgic place in my heart. so when our group of 11 decided to reunite at CF, it was an easy yes. however, this time around, the service was lacking. food was still solid. bbq ranch chicken salad ($9.95) - had the lunch size portion - grilled chicken, corn, black bean, tomatoes, avocado piled in color coded sections around the plate with a mound of shoestring onion rings on top. great visual and tastes good too. arnold palmer set me back $4.50 but you do get refills. sadly only had 1. but back to service... our waiter was s l o w  in getting us water and drink refills. he didn't serve us bread until we asked. repeatedly. i never got my cup of water that i asked for.  he did take our photo off my phone camera. at least he knew how to use it. notable: the kids at our table really enjoyed the red velvet cheesecake. it looked extra decadent."
G. R.,"Fremont, CA",0,36,,4.0,5/7/2013,"Family loves to come here for the desserts...Food is good, but a little pricey for what you get...Have tried many dishes on the menu, and have always been satisfied...Service is good and atmosphere is always really great..."
Tony L.,"Rota, Spain",153,539,2697,3.0,8/22/2009,"Attentive waiter/waitresses and great good. Unlike the Union Square CCF, this place never has lines of 30mins or more. Seated almost immediately and served soon afterwards. I ordered the Chicken Madeira, consisting of sautéed Chicken Breast topped with Asparagus and covered with melted Mozzarella Cheese and  Mushrooms, Madeira Sauce and served with mashed potatoes, though I asked for fries instead of the mashed. Very delicious and loved the Madeira Sauce. Roomy booths and the interior of the restaurant is a dreamworld of colors and light!"
John G.,"Union City, CA",120,83,7,4.0,10/9/2010,"this is the closest cheesecake factory to home so whenever the craving for a good cheesecake hits i come here. I never tried the food at this location, but i'm pretty sure it's the same as it is everywhere else. The waiters/waitresses here seem really nice and were very attentive even though when i come here all i get is cheesecake and hang out at the bar for a bit."
Jyoti C.,"Sunnyvale, CA",48,134,27,1.0,1/20/2008,"The wait time is really pathetic. Either its dine in or take out one has to wait no less than an hour for any kind of order. I placed an order for 2 caeser salads for take-out at 7.35 p.m. The person who took my phone order said it would be ready in 15-20 minutes. Believe it or not I walked out of that place with my order at 8.50 p.m. The 1 star is only for the whole wheat bread and the good cheesecakes that they serve. The menu is average; burgers, sandwiches, salads,pasta. Pasta I feel is never cooked well. I like the portabello mushroom burger and the spicy chicken sandwich, but other than that everything is just average. If you have a lot of time to kill or you are self-involved to not care how long u have to wait or how much time the servers take to attend to u then sure its an ok place to hang out."
Yoann B.,"Palo Alto, CA",4,3,,4.0,4/20/2011,"Hey. I'm new to this website so my reviews might be a little biaised, but I was really impressed by this restaurant. The classy ambiance made me expect overpriced meals, but it was fairly ok. Our waitress was really nice, and we didn't have to wait. What struck me the most was probably the choices : a huge menu to chose from, including a pretty big ""specials"" section. I tried a hamburger, which might be the best one I've ever had so far, and an amazing slice of their famous cheesecake. To put it in a nutshell, I really had a blast."
