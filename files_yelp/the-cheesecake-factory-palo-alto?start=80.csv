Crystal V.,"San Jose, CA",0,8,,1.0,1/13/2017,"If I could give negative stars to this place I would! This place SUCKS! Every time I order to go they ALWAYS get my order wrong and leave things out! I ordered food via door dash and everything was completely wrong. We asked for specific add ons, but they were never given to us!  I had it re-delivered and my burger was still WRONG! I got a burger with no bun BOTH times! I had it re-delivered again, waited an hour and cheesecake just ignored my order! I waited 3 hours for a damn burger that I NEVER even got. Whoever deals with the to-go orders is horrible at their job and should be fired! Including the cooks who ALWAYS get our orders wrong! ALWAYS!  I'm done with this place for good!"
Joe P.,"Newark, CA",0,4,,1.0,11/30/2017,"This place deserves zero stars. Poor service, apathetic staff, & pace/urgency of molasses."
Amy K.,"Foster City, CA",19,126,24,2.0,3/24/2017,"Chain restaurants are not my go to places to eat, but my 10 year old son loves Cheesecake Factory.  And since it was his birthday, I obliged. We went on a Thursday evening around 6:30 pm. The two of us were seated immediately.  Our server took our drink order soon after we were seated. My son wanted a fountain drink and our server suggested a Shirley Temple. But when he returned with my water, he informed us that they were out of Shirley Temples. WHAT!?  So my son asked for a Sprite. Nope. The Sprite machine was empty.  How is a soda machine at a huge chain restaurant empty?  He ordered a Roy Rogers instead.  For dinner my son had the kid's menu fried chicken sliders with fries. It was your run of the mill chain restaurant sliders. Nothing special.  I ordered the hamburger and side salad off the Skinnylicious menu. Don't do it!  You'll be extremely disappointed!  When my burger came out, I almost wanted to laugh...really!?  I realize this is supposed to be a lower calorie dish, but come on!  I was served a slider sized hamburger patty on a regular sized brioche bun with a side salad. I seriously thought the burger was a joke. At least if you're going to cut the size of the burger, cut the size of the bun to match. It was absolutely ridiculous to serve such a small burger in the middle of a gigantic bun. I wish I had taken a picture of this to show how absurd this dish looked!  If I'd known it was going to come out like that, I would've just ordered sliders and only eaten one of them. At least the bun to patty ratio would've made sense, as opposed to my having at least half of my bun wasted because there was no meat to go with it. Seriously, who thought that dish with that presentation was a good idea?  He or she should be fired! I felt like I was getting cheated in my meal or the kitchen playing a very distasteful joke on me. So disappointing. Here's a tip, if you want your customers to think they're eating on the healthier side, don't make them feel like they made the wrong choice or feel awful because they can't have the full size meal with your presentation. Make them feel like they made a good choice and are satisfied with what they ordered. At least the side salad and dressing were good and decently presented.  And really, Cheesecake Factory, are you that cheap that you can't even offer a kid a free ice cream on his birthday?  Of course I bought him an ice cream sundae since it was his birthday (and he doesn't like cheesecake). But I would've thought such a huge chain restaurant would give it's birthday customers at least a free scoop of ice cream with a candle in it. Geez! But as I said, I'm not all in to chain restaurants. I'm giving it 2 stars because the food wasn't awful, just meh. And the service wasn't awful, just meh."
Sarah V.,"Menlo Park, CA",0,4,,1.0,11/3/2017,Lousy call in service. Placed an order and was told to pick up in 45 minutes. I come all the way from Redwood City only to be told it wasn't there. NOT WORTH IT
Feng C.,"Palo Alto, CA",2,30,86,4.0,2/18/2017,This is actually our go to place for weekend lunch. I love their Kobe burger and hubby's favorite is Jaba laya pasta. We have tried a few different flavors of their cheese cakes. They are all great. But I liked the Godive chocolate one the most. Service can be slow sometime.
Adam P.,"Austin, TX",0,8,7,1.0,6/27/2017,"Used to love coming here. But in last year service has been horrible. Just the overall attitude and atmosphere of this place has gone down hill.  Specifically with female waitresses. They hire these people who either are having the worst day of their life, or just hate being alive all together. They make you just want to pay for your food and leave as soon as possible.  The dessert is great here, usually the best part, but the past few times I've gone the service sucked so bad I just left before without ordering dessert because I did not want to feel as though the waitress was doing me a personal favor by getting a cheesecake.  And at that point the less interacting with the waitress the better. Get a new manager in that place!"
April T.,"Redwood City, CA",22,5,,5.0,9/18/2017,Thank you to the staff on Saturday night 9/16. You made my daughters 18th bday a great success with you kindness and great service. We will be back!! We were the party of 8!!
Zoe Y.,"San Francisco, CA",952,213,239,1.0,12/3/2016,"0 stars! Literally the worst Cheesecake Factory I have ever been to. My boyfriend lives close to this location and we always order take-out because I love CF. We have had a few orders wrong from here before, but it's usually something small (for example, they often forget to give Cesar salad dressing with the Cesar salad). Upon our last visit (November 20, 2016) we walked through at about 11pm and placed an order to go. We ordered a Cesar salad, the Four Cheese pasta, Shrimp and Sausage pasta, and two Mango Key Lime cheesecakes. After waiting approximately 30 minutes for our order, we finally received it and checked it and left. When we got home, my boyfriend pulled out his pasta (shrimp and sausage) and it was wrong! Even though we checked it (both dishes have rigatoni), we were deceived by the similar pasta and the condensation on the clear takeout lid. His dish (I included a picture) was probably the worst thing I have ever tasted in my life. I have no idea what it was, but it was terrible. I called the manager, Amy, back, however it was after they closed and they could not do anything for me at the moment. She asked if I paid with a credit card or cash, and unfortunately I made the mistake of paying with cash. She said she could either send me a gift card ""in the mail"" or I could come in and have it re-made, but there was no way to get a refund. I gave her my address and 2 weeks later, have still not received anything. She was so rude and unhelpful when clearly her incompetent employees cannot tell the difference between Shrimp and Sausage pasta vs Rigatoni with vegetables. We will not return; instead we will gladly drive the extra 15 minutes to a different location. I do not recommend this location."
Patrick A.,"San Jose, CA",168,85,139,2.0,12/5/2016,"(This was hard to write.) I went to Cheesecake Factory in Palo Alto with my girlfriend for a quick bite before going home after work. Our visit started out well, but it ended in disappointment. Our server was a very friendly woman named Maria S. and she began trying to sell us drinks and appetizers during the walk to our seats, which was a first for us both. When she sat us, in her section of course, Maria immediately tried selling an appetizer and ""something hot"" to drink once more. When we said that water was fine to start, Maria questioned our decision, ""That's all you want for now?""  From the time she dropped off waters and bread and pushed apps to the time she took our order, we waited 19 minutes. She continued to repeat what we said, but she repeated it as a question, which was a little unnerving after the fifth time. Either way, her soft-spoken voice and kind demeanor made it easy to accept. However, we still had to declare ""no appetizer"" three times. I sympathized at first, then it became hard.  When our food was delivered by the food runners (just under 20 minutes later), my beer had not been delivered. Maria was nowhere in sight so I could voice my complaint, so I went to the bar myself, and sure enough she was right there socializing with her coworkers. I asked the bar tender for a 16 ounce Stella. 13 minutes later I was walking back to my seat. Being a bit annoyed, I walked right past Maria and she didn't say a word when she saw me with my beer.  I sat down and began eating my now cold Chicken Madera, and she was still nowhere to be found. 20 minutes later, she walked past our table with a couple waters and a basket of bread for a table near ours, but she didn't say a word. She absolutely missed the two-bite rule. In fact, she didn't stop to talk to us until it was time for her to try and sell more. We asked for the check and she insisted that we order a cheesecake. ""No, thank you,"" we said together. She ignored us, ""One or two pieces?"" she said. Again we said ""no."" Then she asked again, ""What? No cheesecake? Are you sure?"" Now, I was completely frustrated, so I quickly replied, ""No!"" She came back five minutes later with our check, and, of course, she charged us for the beer.  At first, I was convinced that she had simply forgotten to deliver the beer, but after she began arguing that she delivered it, she insisted that the beer I had was the beer that she delivered. That's when I knew that she was lying and was hoping that we missed the extra charge. I declined once more. At this point, my smile was gone. I politely asked her to remove it, which she said agreed to do and asked to take my credit card, but she had lost my trust, and I was unwilling to provide my payment directly to her. That's when we decided to pay at the front. 12 minutes later, she found us in the front, handed me the check, said ""Have a good night, bye!"" and quickly walked away. Amy (the manager) came out to great us, but I was too frustrated to speak to her in length, so I only mentioned that I had to buy my own beer. She stated that she would ""follow up"" with Maria, but I was not convinced. Tonight, at the Cheesecake Factory in Palo Alto, which is one of my favorite places to eat, it was the first time that I had ever felt judged by a fellow Latino, it was the first time that a server ever tried to charge me extra and insist it was my mistake, and, worst of all, it was the first time at Cheesecake that I ever received poor service. Two stars for the food. =("
Patrick D.,"Minneapolis, MN",0,10,1,1.0,10/25/2017,"Just received the contents of a mixed bag of costco greens poured into a plastic container with some George Foremen dry-ass chicken and moldy peppers sprinkled on top.  It's ok though, they added some sugary dressing that'll wash out the taste."
Sam A.,"San Leandro, CA",3,107,4,1.0,11/17/2017,"This was a terrible experience in all. Hostess took people that came in after we did, same size party. And acted like she didn't see us. When finally seated. Our waiter shows up and starts telling us this story about Kim Kardashian's and kynya were recently in and about the security team that he befriended, tells us how ugly Kim is and how she has huge tits and how he wanted to grab her ass as she left. Even explained how his friend took her Kims straw and sold it on eBay, (but not for much money) Referred to the cooks in the back as the ""bunch of Mexicans"". Simply didn't care how off the wall he was. More importantly, I came here with my friends and family to eat the tamale cakes, (apparently, Kim Kardashian loves them as well according to our waiter) and he forgot to put in my order. All our food came out, except the one item he spent 25 min babbling about! Brought out the wrong items 3 times. The guy was a mess and ruined our dinner and our cheese cake experience."
Gary C.,"East Palo Alto, CA",340,339,2484,3.0,1/6/2016,"Had lunch here today. It's been a while since I've visited a cheesecake factory. Came here today around 12pm, the place was less than half full, perhaps the rain? Anyhow, the service was on point. We quickly got seated, the waitress was on point and attentive. We got what we need in a very timely manner. I still like the black bread a lot more than the sourdough. The food was blend and overcooked, I guess I was expecting too much for a 16 dollars spaghetti and meatball?"
Jeff K.,"Redwood City, CA",0,10,,1.0,5/5/2017,"Probably the worst Cheesecake Factory in the country.  The chain is one of, if not my favorite restaurants. This one in Palo Alto has the worst kitchen anywhere.  Over 50 min. after I ordered my dinner ( the restaurant was over 1/2 empty) 6pm on a Friday night. There might be a reason.  This is the second time my wife and I have come here to wait on the kitchen for our food  It's a good thing there is another Cheesecake Factory in San Mateo."
Ankush P.,"Santa Clara, CA",33,6,62,1.0,11/28/2016,"We were a group of 8 people. Restaurant was not that busy. We gathered for a birthday event. Experience with Appetizers was OK. Avocado egg rolls were prepared in hurry and were not in roll shape at all and very oily. Still OK. Fried Mac & Cheese took a while. Still OK - deep frying can take time. Problem came with main course. 8 entrees were ordered. 3 people were strictly vegetarian in our group: Prob 1: We ordered Evelyn's favorite pasta  veggie burger for 2 vegetarian people in our group. Server returned after 15-20 minutes saying sorry we dont have Veggie burger. So we asked him to double the Evelyn's pasta. Prob 2: Server came after 15 minutes. We dont have Evelyn pasta as well. So we ordered Pasta Da Vinci & Louisiana chicken pasta with chicken on side so that vegetarian people can have food. Prob 3: Main course came 35-45 minutes after the food was ordered. By that time our hunger already died by waiting and drinking water Prob 4: After 15 minutes of main course serving, the pasta came. Both Evelyn & Louisiana Pasta were Raw and hard(not cooked properly). All of that was left in plate and wasted. Thats $34 + taxes in waste right away. Prob 5: Requested for shrimp on side in 4 cheese pasta but shrimp was mixed in food. On informing the manager, she just apologized and nothing else. Is this what you expect from the restaurant with a bill of $235.99 + gratuities? She just apologized and made the cheesecake complimentary. My understanding was that cheesecake is complimentary for birthday girl.  Anyways horrible experience especially with the management in not understanding the situation at all. I am regular @ cheesecake factory but after this i will think twice before visiting."
Justin B.,"Palo Alto, CA",18,8,10,3.0,2/13/2017,"If I had to choose between The Cheesecake Factory and another place for lunch or for desserts, I'd always go with The Cheesecake Factory. Not only do they have amazing food, but the service is great and the specialty drinks awesome. My favorite waitress always tends to my needs every time I go there (and I go there A LOT!) My favorite menu item is the Mushroom Burger (I'm a sucker for anything with mushrooms). The burger is always juicy and flavorful, it's just cooked to perfection. Although I really love the burger during my last visit I had the chicken pot pie and a chinese salad. Both were pretty good although not even close to the burger I was talking about. There is no valet parking available so come early because sometimes finding a spot in the street is a pain."
Taylor D.,"Stanford, CA",0,16,1,1.0,9/2/2017,"Came here on date night with my boyfriend. Our complaint was about the service, not about the food. The food was great. It took at least 30 minutes to seat us, which was fine, except that there were open tables the whole time we were waiting. We ordered waters, drinks, and bread/appetizers when the waitress came and they took forever to come out. I had to ask about my drink because that took even longer than the appetizers. Everything came out around the same time (apps and main course) and when we finished eating the empty dishes stayed on our table until we left, no one cleaned them off. We wanted to order cheesecake but I had to go ask someone else to take our order because our waitress was nowhere to be found. That took a while to come out too. We go to Cheesecake a lot together at a lot of different locations and this was our worst experience so far."
Just M.,"Redwood City, CA",0,31,4,1.0,11/5/2017,Sad we come often but We had the worst services ever! We will Never be back! They really need to train the servers and managers! HORRIBLE
Mitch K.,"Palo Alto, CA",40,12,,2.0,8/30/2017,"First time to TCF. The reason why I give 2 instead of 1 stars was the friendly server. Now, why not 5 stars? The service desk told us we'll get a table for two in 20 minutes, instead, we waited 40. The food wasn't great. In their pasta sauces, they had too much oil and too much butter. After lunch, we wanted to take a whole cake to a birthday. Even though they had plenty of cakes out, they said I need to come back in two hours so they can defrost. So I just took a piece, which tasted not even that great. Definitely can't recommend this business."
Karuneek A.,"San Jose, CA",1,6,,1.0,8/19/2017,"This location is very disappointing. We have always gone to the Stevens Creek, Santa Clara one and never had any complaints and our 1st time to the Palo Alto location and the server kept coming back that we do not have this and this and then this dish that you ordered (3 dishes out of the 4 we ordered). On top of that our regular favourite dish Bang Bang Chicken & Shrimp was totally bland and tasteless, almost like eating steamed rice alone. All dishes were horrible. Never expected to have this experience at CCF. Never coming to this location again!!"
Angela V.,"San Jose, CA",50,5,,1.0,8/18/2017,"Today I picked up food for my coworkers, I just have to say what a big disappointment and you will never be going back to this location & I'll make sure my friends don't either.  First when my coworker and I called to place a large order for pickup we were on hold for 10 minutes before I called again from another phone and they finally take my order. We ordered 6 different things, $66 dlls. Even though the service when picking up was good, the whole meal was ruined and worst of all wrong.  I called out to talk to a supervisor and let him know, tried and be patient, but he was rude and un helping and he also put me on hold for the longest time. I talked to Jonatan and he was rude and most of all made me feel like I was lying about what happened. I do not appreciate this service and I just wish you cared about your service and the way you handle these situations. I will not be going back here."
