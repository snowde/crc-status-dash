Hazel Grace D.,"Seattle, WA",233,223,11,1.0,8/16/2006,"The Cheesecake factory is overpriced junk food with a 45 minute wait. They have an extensive menu and can make pretty much anything you want, except for quality food... but they heap an obscene amount of fattening ""food"" on your plate in hopes that perhaps you won't realize it just isn't any good - and you don't, America, you don't...  restaurants like this are one of the reasons our country is so fat. If you want to clog your own aorta fine, but at least leave your children out of it - hopefully, you wouldn't give them drugs or alcohol, so don't give them Cheesecake factory either - it's probably worse for their health: "
Tammy Y.,"San Ramon, CA",11,37,4,4.0,1/19/2010,"dude it's cheesecake factory... if u haven't been here, then you're either a) not a fan of cheesecake (in this case: what's wrong w/u?) b) definitely don't live in or near palo alto (or near any other cheesecake factories for that matter) c) don't like to wait to be seated AT ALL (let alone wait for 1+ hours to be seated during busy hours) d) broke or you have cheap friends (don't get mad, i'm just being honest) e) and the only other explaination: you're allergic to cheesecake (which is a perfectly good excuse to not get dessert, but should at least go in to try the food) if it's none of the above, then what the heck are you waiting for??"
Tiffany N.,"Fremont, CA",1,8,,4.0,4/17/2013,"I've been to this location many, many times over the last 6 years. The service and food have always been consistently good. It's a comfortable place to lounge around with friends and young children. My only complaint is that sometimes the take out takes longer than promised to prepare. Other than that, I'm a fan."
Angie J.,"Hayward, CA",94,139,160,4.0,4/20/2007,"Cheesecake in PA is one of the best that I've been to. The ones in so. California do not compare! There's not a thing on the menu that I don't like. I could use a little less 'rude' from some of the wait staff. I went in today for lunch and needed to break cash for a tip. I went to the dessert counter where two people were maticulously putting whip cream on some cakes... they were not to be bothered. I asked politely for the change, and the short chubby one huffed and puffed and rolled her eyes at me as she proceeded to steer away from the whipped cream aparatus to wash her hands and give me change. If it wasn't for her, this would've gotten a 5 star from me. If you like Cheesecake Factory, you'll love Grand Luxe Cafe. Same company."
"Bateman, P.","CA, CA",3,36,,1.0,6/22/2007,"I've had better food for less. I came in here a year or so ago with a former friend. She also happened to be a former employee of this place and knew it wouldn't be crowded. What a waste of time and money. It took them 35 minutes to get my sandwich & fries to me and (surprise!) it was cold. Well, by that time I was starving so I took it as I got it. I got about two bites into my sandwich and picked at a fry until I couldn't take it anymore. I asked our waiter for the manager. He politely asked if it was anything he had done and I let him know that it wasn't. The manager came over after 10 minutes. What a rude, pretentious, middle-aged, shit bag with a receding hairline and a beer gut. He curtly asked what the problem was and when I told him he took the plate, walked off and never returned.  I've never directly complained about food (or really anything) before, but after observing others complain I figured he would have asked how he could make my experience more enjoyable or apologized...something. But no, of course not. After waiting 10 minutes for his Royal Highness of Cheesecakedom to return I left without paying, but not before tipping our waiter. He was the only enjoyable thing about my visit."
Fen Z.,"Adams Morgan, Washington, DC",88,223,3,5.0,8/13/2006,"I think my first reason for going to the Cheesecake Factory in Palo Alto was that I felt homesick for Boston and undergrad upon arriving at Stanford for grad school.  I used to go to the Cheesecake Factory in Kendall Square all the time, and it was one of the few places I really felt at home in here in California.  There's just something about the fact that all the restaurants have the high ceilings and slightly gaudy (or very gaudy?) Las Vegas Egyptian look.  The fact that the menus were identical between Boston and Stanford made me feel right at home. Nothing like the avocado egg rolls.  The fried mac and cheese is also awesome.  Recently (as in tonight) I rediscovered to joys of the Factory Peach Bellini.  I think it's the champagne in it that gets me toasty drunk very quickly.  Therefore, forgive any spelling errors I may have made in this review."
Ryan H.,"San Francisco, CA",0,4,,1.0,4/17/2012,"I've had other great experiences with the Cheesecake Factories all over the place, until I went to the one in Palo Alto last week.  Usually you can expect good service, prompt waiters, and no problems....until last week!  I was with a group and the waiter wouldn't even take our picture, saying he'd come back to do it and never did, and I mean literally never came back!!  They tried to pull a fast one and switched waiters on us, without even telling us or apologizing for it.  In effect, we waited a long time for our food and bill.  It must have been over two hours from the time we sat down to the time we left.  Our food came extremely slow, when we finally got the bill the waiters couldn't figure out how to split our bill 4 ways, and to top that off one of the waiters was trying to push cheesecake on us when we were full, as if we didn't have an option to say no!  Never going back to this one again!"
Brent A.,"Daly City, CA",213,427,22,3.0,10/12/2008,"I would have given Cheesecake a higher rating, but tonight was terrible.  Cheesecake is fairly standard across the board, but the service is the key element to whether or not you have a good experience. The drinks were over-priced and not made correctly.  A blended, ultimate margarita should be blended.  A Kahlua cocktail should have a fair amount of alcohol, not be ice and ginger ale. The salmon firecrackers were tasty, but really it was because of the chili spices that were tantalizing my tongue.  The actual salmon seemed mediocre at best, and certainly less than fresh. My friend ordered an appetizer salad with Caesar dressing, but apparently out waitress thought she said ""Caesar salad."" My spicy chicken salad was terrible.  I'm all for earthy, healthy flavors, but this was certainly lacking.  The cilantro over-powered the entire dish.  The chicken was as dry as the Mojave.  My friend's chipotle pasta was really delicious, but again it was attributed to the chili spices.   Our waitress was terrible.  Terrible.  She took incredibly long to even greet us.  After ordering, she took over five minutes to bring our water.  Our appetizers came out well before our cocktails even arrived.  Every time the waitress came by, she would leave within seconds.  When she asked about our food, I said it was ""okay.""  She asked if I wanted to send my salad back, but at that point it was pointless.   When she came to check up on us at the end of our meal, she took forever to bring our to-go box.  She should have brought the dessert menu with her at the time, but had to scamper away to bring that back.  When she came back for our dessert choice, we decided to not have anything, and then had to wait again for her to magically retrieve the bill.  Seriously, terrible. When we were paying, I took my bill up to the front and complained about the charge for the ""Caesar"" salad, which I admit was only $0.96 more what we should have been charged.  I almost mentioned a few of my other complaints to the manager, and he comped our appetizer salad and my cocktail.  Thanks!  That's the only reason I'm giving this place the extra star because it originally would have been 2. If you come here, hope you get a good server.  Also, be prepared to bring food home because the portions are enormous.  Oh, and if you come here to drink, be ready to pay high prices.  My friend's margarita was $10.50, and my cocktail was $7.50 before it was comped."
Alissa T.,"Menlo Park, CA",28,167,1,1.0,8/7/2006,"The ultimate American portion size, Super HUGE!! This is like an upper class Denny's, except Denny's probably has better service. Went here for brunch and they screwed up the order 3 times and the 3rd time was still incorrect (even the manager when he tried to fix it, got it wrong)--I did not ask for substitusion either, just ordered right from their own menu. Then they did not do anything to make up for it, no discount, no free cake, nothing just ""oh Hope you will still come back"". Let me think, I will come back bc you screw up my order 3x and have high hopes that the quality of food is not the criteria of my dining out options? hmmm I don't think so!  I gave it one star bc if I gave none, I can not post my review but also because i get the chocolate cake from here TO GO only...they occassionaly screw up by cutting it smaller than the usual size and charge me the same amount."
S G.,"Santa Clara, CA",14,91,,2.0,11/5/2006,"I think the only good thing about this place is the cheesecake. So, we went for 11am Sunday brunch. We waited for about 10 minutes...So far, so good. But the good did not last long.... The waiter was either new or had too many tables because the service was terrible! It took forever to get our food and extras like splenda (it seemed like hell because my 3 year old was very antsy waiting). Most of the time we go out to eat, our server is sensitive to the fact that I have a toddler, so they are very helpful and I give them a huge tip for it. BUT not at this place! I could make better omelettes and potatoes at home! My toast came out black and burned and the potatoes were dry and salty!! The omelet looked like yellow foam or something fake! YUCK! I watched as 2 tables around me asked for the manager because they were also not happy with the service. I was disappointed because I hear so many great things about this restaurant chain. I am not going back again :("
Ali A.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",26,45,,5.0,8/4/2007,Hey Yelpers! Did you know that if you show up at The Cheesecake Factory (at least the one in Palo Alto) with a toddler in your party they immediately bring that toddler a plate of artfully arranged banana and bread slices? For free?!!! Well they do. And they do it pretty much the minute you sit down.  This could be the best thing that's happened to me in a restaurant since I had a child. It has increased my love for The Factory tenfold. Go visit them yourself and witness the miracle.
David G.,"Palo Alto, CA",0,38,3,2.0,2/1/2009,"I have given Cheesecake factory a few chances and now draw the conclusion ""it is what it is!"" In this case SIZE does matter, everything is just so frickin' big. I have no issue with a leviathan portion of cheesecake, after all the clue is in the name. My problem is that everything is so offensively large that unless you make a special trip solely for sweet, it is unlikely you will get there as the previous courses will just fill up too much space. Some may say, ""have a salad"" and indeed I did, it was in fairness tasty and interesting, to start with, but after ploughing on for 30 mins to be still faced with a never deminishing pile of food I gave up! The current headline of ""celebrating 30 Delecious years"" should perhaps be changed with ""contributing to obesity for 30 years"".  I weep when I consider the amount of food that must be thrown away when people are on the streets and hungry.  Cheesecake factory, good concept, great sweats and for the most part decent food (for a chain), but please don't just hide behind quantity. If you make something good, people will still come."
Glaciala A.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,830,,3.0,8/22/2010,"Went with a group to Cheesecake factory and for the second  time it seems that they have difficulty with bringing out all the dishes at the same time. This was the 2nd time that my dish has arrived last, not just by 30 seconds but by at least 5 minutes---which can make it a bit awkward. They forgot someone's drink order and also the service was pretty slow. Meh, it's a chain."
Amado R.,"Newark, CA",71,131,6,4.0,10/18/2010,"I typically will not rate a full chain restaurant because there is nothing unique about them; however if the restaurant gives good value, best service for the money I dont see any issues. Cheesecake factory is by far the best full chain restaurant for the money, servers are well rounded, deciplined and really earn their tips. Food is good, well balanced and the menu seems to move fairly well. So if you find yourself hungry and looking for hasle free place consider the CCF!"
Maryellen O.,"San Anselmo, CA",7,29,4,1.0,9/22/2007,if they read Yelp they would find out that they need to improve on management which manages the waitstaff that stink! I could overcome bad food if the service was better.
Briana F.,"San Francisco, CA",3,22,,5.0,1/15/2011,"The Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite splurges. The food is delicious, drinks are refreshing and the cheesecake is amazing.  I recently complained on their website about the disappointment in the service I received at this location. Two days later, I received a call from the manager apologizing for my experience, as well as a personally written apology and gift card in the mail shortly there after. She really went above and beyond."
Tom L.,"Clayton, CA",0,334,8,2.0,10/26/2008,"Met a bunch of friends for dinner here. Great location, where you can shop at small boutiques and chain giants like restoration hardware down the street. The food here is like the other cheesecake factory's. Its pretty good and lots and lots of selection. Not a lot of veggie options though for the vegetarians out there. The service is terrible. They forgot (what is that about) our party and we waited for 1 1/2 to get a table..even though we kept asking and asking. Then when the food came out, they ""forgot"" a couple of the orders."
j o.,"San Francisco, CA",2,22,,2.0,10/15/2008,"Gigantic portions. Everytime, and I mean every single time I order a turkey sandwich with a very emphasized ""NO MAYO,"" mayo always magically ends up on my sandwich. And then I have to send it back and I feel bad (but they should have gotten it right). The turkey is kind of dry, and the sandwich completely falls apart and is really messy and difficult to eat. The servers are really nice and helpful, but I don't exactly enjoy coming here."
Kris I.,"Mountain View, CA",110,187,47,3.0,6/26/2008,"What can I say - it's the Cheesecake factory... nothing mind blowing... coming here is like playing war (the card game), you never know what you're gonna get.  Sometimes you get great food and fantastic service - sometimes your meal tastes like left overs and the service is crapola.... Get  plus points for having a quite large menu ... BUT, minus points for shafting the vegan & vegetarians... there is nothing to choose from except a boring salad and omitting the cheese.   For the wait you usually have - would rather hit up University cafe or Nola's... Oh, but for the Cheesecake!!!  Smack me sideways - their cheesecake can do no wrong!"
Ernesto G.,"Santa Clara, CA",62,28,,1.0,11/22/2009,"It's a shame that an establishment with such a recognizable name would have treated me and my group with such terrible service; even more so for trying to have a nice sit down dinner for my birthday with friends and family. Upon arriving, the front desk was well aware that I had a big group and they stated they would do everything they could to to get us seated. 2 HOURS later, I was not seated. Granted, it was me plus 14, but every time I went back to ask how much longer, the responses were the same ""we're waiting for one more table to open up so we can get you seated"", ""we're waiting for two more table to open up so we can get everyone in"". Finally, when I talked to who seemed like the manager, all he could say was ""I'm sorry"". Sure he was. And when in the end when I told him that I had been waiting for 2 hours, and if he thought waiting for that long was cool, he went as low to say ""well you could walk over to the bar and have a drink while you're waiting"". Serious?  It seemed like every person who was working the front desk didn't care to have eye contact with anybody who walked in, and they didn't have a problem seating about 6-8 groups of around 4-6 people who arrived after I did, and got sat before I did... some even left after enjoying their dinner.  Bottom line, I may have been the fool for believing they were close to getting my group seated, but they could care less about the customer at this place. Better yet, just head on down a couple of feet and enjoy a slice of pizza at Pizza-My-Heart since I didn't have a lot of options to go have dinner with a group my size after waiting (and I can't stress this enough) FOR 2 HOURS! They'll serve you immediately, and will even have a good laugh with you about you're bad experience at The Cheesecake Factory."
