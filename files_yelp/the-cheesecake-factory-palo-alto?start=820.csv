Whitney B.,"Mountain View, CA",2,25,1,1.0,11/27/2011,"The food here is pretty good.  Nothing ever really amazes me.  The service is terrible though.  I've been several times and had mediocre service, but the last time I went was pretty much the last straw.  Our server was okay, but he brought another girl by and said she'd be helping out with the table, which is code for I'm going on break.  The food was pretty slow, but we were chill, we didn't say anything about it.  When the girl came by she was really rude, not sure why as we hadn't even spoken to her.  The food came out and she had one dish that no one ordered.  She kept trying to give it to different people even though we kept telling her no one ordered it.  She was giving us this ""well this is what they cooked so someone was going to eat it""  attitude?!  Really, one of the guys she tried to force it on was a vegetarian and it was a chicken dish.  I ended up being the lucky winner of the wrong dish, so she whisked it back to the kitchen.  After like 10 min.  I told the front desk I didn't want it since I had no idea how long it was going to be (our original dishes were about an hour).  They said that was fine.  The manager came to talk to us and kept trying to get me to just take the meal, but I wasn't really hungry anymore since I had just shared with everyone else.  He didn't offer a discount or anything."
Christina C.,"San Mateo, CA",129,666,7,4.0,3/11/2008,"DISCLAIMER:  This is a review of their happy hour bar menu only. We were seated at the bar area quickly since it was only 4 or so.  They have a bar menu offering/happy hour thing from 4-6pm.  Here's the tricky bit.  They don't automatically seat you with that menu.  You have to get up, go over to the bar proper, pester the bar-tender for it, wait while she rolls her eyes at you and then trollop over back to your table, climb lithely onto the bar stool and pretend like nothing happened.   The bar menu is great because everything is either $3.95 or $4.95.  We got the sliders (deee-lish!), lettuce wraps (cruchy and fresh), spring rolls (hard and required an autopsy).  It was more than enough food for the two of us.  They didn't give us bread like they normally do.  Is that the sacrifice for ordering from the bar menu?  It didn't matter.  We were stuffed. The drinks were not happy hour specials.  The waiter told us that lots of other places do happy hour drinks and food but for some strange commie-b*st*rd reason, they don't do it here.   I'd come back for the happy hour bar menu, but only to eat.  The drinks were ok.  I can think of other places I'd rather go for drinks.  But the food here, at this kind of price, is worth it."
David Y.,"San Jose, CA",0,4,,4.0,1/16/2013,"Came here with my girl friend Friday night. We got a seat in less then 10 min which was awesome. The waiter was really nice. He made suggestions. Then we ordered chicken Madeira, salmon and calamari.  Everything came hot and all the dishes tasted amazing.  I'll definitely come back soon."
Meredith O.,"Menlo Park, CA",67,188,8,4.0,6/3/2008,"I love the Avocado Eggrolls, oh just writing them makes me want them now, it is worth the trip alone. Hubs hates the long line/wait and the hit n miss service.  We went once a few months ago, they were not that busy and the service was lousy. We went again the other night and the service was top notch! They have a huge diverse menu - where else can you get Meatloaf, Pizza, wasabi seared ahi tuna, monte cristo sandwiches, Huevos Rancheros, a Sheperds Pie, a Fillet and a taco???? All very well done at that.  Always get the smaller salad... it is hard to finish on its own. We are going to try it next for Breakfast....."
Raymond C.,"Sunnyvale, CA",0,8,,4.0,1/12/2011,"Only 4 because I'm a reservations type of guy , other wise a great place ,and wallet friendly ."
Kapo T.,"San Francisco, CA",51,283,811,3.0,3/6/2010,"after eating here for years, i think i m sick of this place. but this review is not about how i feel but about their food.  i remember going to any cheesecake factory and you'll have to wait for HOURS! the trick is to have a late dinner and come at 8:30p or 9p.  their portions are HUGE.  great for college students or guys who generally need to eat more to fill up.  i don't have a favorite dish but will usually get the steak or popcorn shrimp.   we do always order the buffalo blast or the calamari when we're here.  that's a must try!"
Alissa S.,"Menlo Park, CA",48,344,13,3.0,4/18/2008,"I think we all know the Cheesecake factory. Busy, loud, big portions, etc. Get here right after 5, definitely before 6, or you will have to wait a long long time. I will say I went here for my birthday last year, was the first to arrive and secure a table for a party of 8. They stuck me at a booth for four, and then kept adding chairs, although there were plenty of open tables. It was a nightmare, like they didn't believe 8 people were really coming? We were crammed in like sardines and there was no room for presents and we were surrounded by empty tables. I went here again last night. My friend noted that there are no prices on the menu for beers and other drinks. Very odd, and resulted in a lot of back and forth between the waiter and the bar. The waiter was nice but mentioned right off the bat he had a baby at home, complete non-sequitur, making me think he was hinting for a big tip. I always tip big, but still, it was kind of odd.  But I love the Chicken costaletta here. Breaded chicken in a lemon sauce with mashed potatoes and asparagus, and enough for three meals. I wish it was a bit cheaper than $15.99, but still, you have to treat yourself. We also enjoyed the avocado eggrolls with tamarind sauce. Sweet, not spicy, and the tamarind sauce was good. Three stars from me is an ""average"" rating."
Ashley B.,"Tucson, AZ",162,341,10,2.0,4/1/2009,"This restaurant is beautiful as most of them are. The food is okay, I think it's priced a bit to high for their quality. Also the drinks are astronomical priced compared to what you get."
Joyce L.,"San Francisco, CA",60,245,4,3.0,2/8/2007,"I like this chain because 1) the menu is huge and even though I'm an indecisive kind of person, it's nice to know all types of food converge here, 2) it always has a rather grandiose entrance with high ceilings, and 3) I'm not a frequent visitor so it's a nice change.  Now, a couple of things I don't like...1) the food can be VERY heavy - I ordered this parmesan-crusted chicken with angel hair in a ""light"" tomato sauce once and the pasta was covered in cheese (kind of reminiscent of the Macaroni Grill), and 2) there is usually a long wait (no probs coming to this locale for lunch so far, though).   Last thing - my friend and I actually tried the low-carb (or low-something) cheesecake, and it wasn't bad!"
Erin Leigh M.,"Oakland, CA",17,53,,3.0,3/1/2007,"3 stars overall, 5 stars to one menu item in particular - the Avocado Roll apps.   The rest of the menu, which obnoxiously comes in a f'ing encyclopedia, is pretty good... but seriously?  I only read novels when i'm forced too and second, when someone says ""sure we'll subsitute the chicken on your salad with shrimp, but i'll cost a little more"" i sure the SHIT don't expect it to be $5.95 for 3 shrimp.   For $5.95 they can take their 3 shrimp and suck a fat one. Also, no offense, but can (west) Palo Alto be any more white?  Two cheers for integrating some diversity in that place!  HERE HERE!"
Jennifer D.,"San Bruno, CA",103,65,208,1.0,5/23/2011,"First time visit for my nephews b-day last night and was completely disappointed. With such a large menu of items; we had some simple questions regarding what the * stood for by the items and if the Roasted Veggie & Goat Cheese pizza actually had Goat Cheese ( the ""other"" white cheese, Mozzarella was listed in the description...not goat cheese). We were told it was both. So we ordered 2 of those -- noticed pesto (again, not noted on the menu) on top of the pizza but no goat cheese. Those that know their goat cheese know it has a certain taste. BE AWARE: No goat cheese on the Roasted Veggie & Goat Cheese pizza. We ordered 2 kids cheese pizzas with olives....1 kids pizza came with kalamata olives (not many kids I know like kalamata olives); should of been black olives. Juices never came until asked for several times. The other cheese pizza with olives showed up; adult size with no olives. :/ HUH Salad showed up dry....had to ask for dressing; took forever to get that. By then, one person in our party finally got his meal. The rest of us were halfway done. We had two different servers...I felt bad for the second guy who came in the middle of the meal. The table with 1 person got so much more attention than our table of 7 did....I was speechless! Dessert time: We told the lady in the front we had a b-day with the name; told our server as well....and yet somehow the 2nd server to help us had not been told. I told him and he said they would bring an ice cream sundae. I know this is on the house...but for a place with portion sizes bigger than ones stomach, I was in awe at the cheap sundae given for a birthday! Let alone the lack of ice cream in the sundae. After bringing up the issues with our first server, he did remove the adult pizza and extra apple juice they charged us for and comp. the meal that was late reaching the table. Unfortunately it was a little to late at that point; the disappointment set in from the moment the food arrived and continued to get worse as the night went on. We got our water glasses filled close to when we were about finished with our meals. Service was slow and poor in giving attention to at least our table. Tip was given but really only was cause I didn't want the 2nd server to get cheated out on someone else poor service. Needless to say, we won't be back and wouldn't give it any stars if I didn't have to."
j s.,"San Jose, CA",0,4,1,1.0,12/12/2011,"Terrible service at the palo alto location, food took over 1 hour to arrive,our  waitress Miranda came by to check every 30 minutes. Dinner entrees were served late and incomplete, waitress just didnt care. I wont go here again for sure"
Ruthie J.,"Daly City, CA",0,17,14,5.0,9/7/2009,"We go here often enough to know the food is great, the drinks are super and the desserts are heavenly.  But this Sunday night, Danny the maitre d' took such good care of us they deserve these 5 stars for his service."
Shannon W.,"San Carlos, CA",49,83,,4.0,6/19/2008,"Been here multiple times and haven't been disappointed yet.  Sometimes the wait for to-go can be a bit long- but more often than not it's pretty good. Great idea to order off the bar menu if you have the chance to be there between 4-6, great options and way cheaper (try the spicy buffalo wings!) Favorite drinks: Georgia Peach Strawberry Martini Red Raspberry Martini. The service can be hit or miss- ex: our waitress last time assumed that we were giving her a $15+ tip instead of giving us change for our bill (tip was actually equivalent to about $8)."
Allena M.,"San Jose, CA",26,7,,2.0,8/16/2010,"So I have never been a huge fan of the Palo Alto location but being that my sister was raving about how good their so called ""made to order"" guacamole was I conceded and went for it. Unfortunately this item didn't taste as great as expected and signifigant assistance from the waiter it was still pretty bland, When asked if it could be removed from the bill the manager came over and rudely stated ""What seems to be the problem, it looks like you ate most of it"" Regardless of what was eaten or not eaten are you seriously talking to someone in your establishment lke that? As for the other items we ordered, they were great and our server, Marcus, was totally awesome!"
Dennis O.,"Fremont, CA",666,399,42,4.0,3/2/2008,"Excellent restaurant design, lots of space. Just make sure you get here early like before 6pm on weekends since most customers like to linger on their tables.  The food was pretty ok, had the peppered shrimp and my date has seared tuna salad. A little pricey but I guess you're paying for the ambiance here."
Irfan R.,"San Jose, CA",370,517,37,4.0,3/27/2010,"Usually less crowded than other Cheesecake factorys (i.e. san jose and SF ones).  The bread is great!  The mango iced drink is excellent (although they have increased the size of it now).  The crab cake sandwich is pretty good.  I also like the cajun shrimp plate with black beans.  For cheesecake try the red velvet, banana or dulce.  Pretty good service here."
Simone M.,"Santa Monica, CA",13,56,,3.0,8/5/2006,"Hilariously big portions, loud, expensive, and the decor is hideous, but they're open pretty late, they're not overwhelmingly objectionable to anyone, and they serve up a mean mojito. This means I go here a lot.  I recommend their crazy, ridiculous dessert - I don't remember what it's called, but it's a huge slice of chocolate cake and three scoops of ice cream or something. You eat the ice cream in the restaurant and take the whole cake home, saturated with ice creamy goodness. You can eat a few bites of that cake every day for a week. It's the dessert that keeps on giving, friend."
I T.,"Palo Alto, CA",1,70,,2.0,4/9/2007,"Although the biigggg mozzerella pizza was relatively cheap ( around $11) it definitely had some quality issues. First off, no pizza should melt in the middle. There are not supposed to be a wheel in the middle that the crust dislodges from and rotates about.  Secondly, the cheese should not congeal into a big, nasty lump. No slinking back to that forementioned wheel of evil soggy crust, please! Finally, speaking about crusts, it should be cooked but not so cooked that it's completely charred. The flavors would have melded well together if they had been mostly unsoggy/unburnt/etc before I had eaten it."
G. R.,"San Francisco, CA",1,256,,4.0,12/10/2007,"Why do so many people on this site feel compelled to trash this place???  I have been to both this location and the one in San Francisco and had great food and service both times.  I also see a lot of complaining that the food was unhealthy....well...no kidding!  But they're not trying to run a health farm either.  And if you want to eat healthy....go get an organic salad at Whole Foods.  It is what it is.  And there ARE healthy choices.   Not one thing on the plate of the Thai Chicken Wrap appetizer is fried - so there you go.  And most of the employees I encountered had an acceptable to outstanding attitude.  The only thing that keeps this rating from being 4 stars is that our bread took 10 minutes to arrive and came with no butter and the server did not always refill our drinks without us asking.  Other than that the experience was great. And so what if there's advertising on the menu?????  It's only on one side of the menu so just ignore it!  Nobody's forcing you to read it and nobody's forcing you to eat in this restaurant.   I don't see people screeching about advertising when they see it on a bus, in a magazine, on TV, etc. so why bitch about it here????"
