David K.,"Redwood City, CA",0,3,,1.0,11/9/2009,"Cheesecake Factory sucks. Wine glass with foody finger prints all over the glass, spoon with dried up food on it, waitress spilled bread and butter on my wife, slow service and burnt fish. We'll never go back there again."
Marissa H.,"Palo Alto, CA",44,67,,2.0,4/5/2010,"First off, this place is hideous!  It is like the cheap part of Vegas trying to be sophisticated.  I try not to come here because I can't stand the decor, but the guys at work like eating here.   I love to eat, but the food portions are ridiculous and the palatability of the food is not worth the calories.   I think we looked up a few dishes we ordered and they were all over 1,400 calories.  I don't mind eating high calorie food, but sub par high calorie food served in an ugly restaurant is no fun at all."
Y. G.,"San Mateo, CA",316,43,13,2.0,7/19/2010,"If you want to taste real Italian food, do not choose here.  Cheesecake is its special, but anything worth mentioning."
Melody D.,"Bloomington, IN",76,112,,3.0,3/19/2008,"Um, the decor hurts my eyes.  You could say Cheesecake is to ""class"" what Starbucks is to ""hip.""  That said, the dishes are often very tasty.. they're much more consistent than some of the more high brow offerings down the street.  They also have generous portions and a looong menu (great for when you have no idea what you're in the mood for). Bottom line:  Good food in a lame setting."
Aurora C.,"Palo Alto, CA",4,23,,3.0,8/17/2010,"Came here for my dad's birthday. Dishes we ordered and I tried: Pumpernickel bread: So good, but usually it's cold. Avocado rolls: Absolute must. The tamarind sauce goes so well with the creamy avocado. The next time I come here, I'm only ordering this. haha Pulled BBQ pork sandwich: Nothing special. Fries were nice and crispy, which was nice. Pasta da Vinci: Solid pasta. Tangy and sweet.  Obviously, the food is loaded with oil. So beware. We told the waiter about my dad's bday. I was always under the impression that birthday cheesecake was free, but I guess not...? (it was also the waiter's first day...)"
Phil S.,"San Jose, CA",111,68,8,4.0,4/6/2010,"I love this place! I live closer to the Valley Fair one, but I stopped going there because of the 30-45 minute wait. Every time I come here, I'm usually seated within 5-10 minutes. There is always somewhere to park nearby. The service has always been good here. And if you like fish, try the miso salmon!!! You won't regret it!"
Long N.,"Union City, CA",1,48,5,1.0,3/5/2009,"well, i guess this review is for all the cheesecake factories.  GROSS!  with the exception of the cheesecake itself, the food here is barely edible.  yea, they do make it look good, but your eyes are deceiving you.  trust your tastebuds (if they survive this experience).  the food is overseasoned and all you really taste is the million grams of salt your consuming. i give it one star for the cheesecake.  it's smooth and creamy and not too sweet.  the original plain is my favorite, but also try the godiva chocolate or the pumpkin (when in season)."
Bruce T.,"Asheville, NC",1,24,1,2.0,7/2/2010,"We stopped in for lunch 2 times this past week. The first time on Saturday after dropping our son off a Stanford for a swim clinic. My wife had the Kobe burger and I had one of my favorites,  Jambalaya. We sat at the bar and enjoyed the food which was prepared well. The bartenders were great and attentive. The second visit was yesterday when we returned to Stanford to pick up our son. We arrived for lunch and was promply seated. My wife ordered the pasta w/chicken. It arrived cold and the chicken was too fatty. She had the waiter take it back and she ordered the oriental chicken salad which she ate with no complaints. I ordered a tomato basil pasta w/chicken featured on the lunch menu. It was not up to my expectations. The pasta was not cooked and the chicken also was too fatty. The manager came be to apologize for the inconvenience. Come on Cheesecake Factory. You can do better!"
Rinne R.,"Union City, CA",128,385,192,4.0,6/24/2006,"For a big restaurant chain, Cheesecake Factory is actually one of the best.  This one in downtown Palo Alto is fairly new, but it rivals the other CF when it comes to the wait time.  It gets pretty crowded, but if you're eating there for brunch or lunch, they'll accept reservations. My bf, sis, and I went there last night to take advantage of the gift certificate given to my bf (thanks, JV).  It took less than30 minutes, which I'd say is pretty good on a Friday night at close to 9 pm.   We got the calamari appetizer, which is always reliable.  My sis & I shared the crispy beef served over rice with mushrooms and green beans--a huge entree that my sis dubbed as Americanized Chinese.  Ah...I never thought of my fave dish that way, but it makes sense now.. My bf got the filet mignon (or was it rib eye?), and I thought it was just ok.  I liked his mashed potatoes better. Their cheesecake is what attracts most people, and they're usually the best.  But the one we chose last night was slightly disappointing.. the chocolate, peanut butter,and cookie dough one....We got the whole combination thing going & since we were gonna share it, we thought, ""What the hell.....might as well get everything on it!""  It was too, too rich!!  Shoulda just gone with the tiramisu or the strawberry...oh well!! Service was also friendly and fast!!"
Rhia R.,"South San Francisco, CA",256,600,483,3.0,4/6/2009,"If I had to choose between waiting for a long time to get into a club in Vegas and waiting for a table in this place, guess which one I'd pick. No matter which location you go to, there will always be a wait....ALWAYS. Not a good idea to come here with a massive group because that's what you'll be doing the majority of the time you're there. However, it wasn't too much of a drag once we were all finally seated. The frozen Bellini is awesome, and I can't seem to stray away from their chicken madeira. I always order it. Shoot, I love the stuff so much, I already had it in mind as soon as I came through the door. Unfortunately I didn't have the chance to have their Kahlua cheesecake because I didn't have room for it. If you have things planned and want to keep them that way, don't go here. But if you're willing to waste away a good chunk of your time, then go for it."
Jim C.,"Redwood City, CA",150,1366,711,4.0,6/24/2006,"I don't like to eat at restaurant chains much, but I'll make the exception for Cheesecake Factory. I've tried many locations over the years and the nice thing is the consistency of food, the wide range of menu options, and the large portions which I like.  Some of my favorites there are the passionfruit-flavored iced tea, bruschetta appetizer (great tasting tomato, garlic, basil topping), seafood scampi, cajun pasta, HUGE salads (all kinds), and the cheesecake (the few times I do make it to that). Sure there's usually a wait, but you have to like TCF..."
Chris S.,"Mountain View, CA",0,4,,1.0,3/10/2013,"Worst time ever in a restaurant. I worked in the service industry and to have the entire staff to act like we were keeping them from doing nothing was ridiculous. So, from their beginning we had our reservations messed up. We had reservations at 6:30 and they got pushed back because tables that already paid for their bill and were sitting no longer ordering. Then being told that we can't get a table together because of this. We didn't get sat until 8pm and then it was squeezing 11 people into a booth at the bar. The hostess told us that this was better than nothing. Nothing? Remember we had reservations. To the so called manager coming to tell us at the beginning they messed up and would make it up. Then the bus boy setting down all the table settings on the table in one pile. Oh we can set that up as customers I guess. Then the birthday girls cheesecake came right at the beginning of dinner. Finally at the end of dinner after a second complaint three manager decided to do something nice for us. He took off the $13.95 salad and birthday cheesecake for just the birthday girl. Nevermind the rest of us. Then after a third complaint to another manager, he offered to give the birthday girl and her boyfriend a free dinner. Once again nothing for the rest of the party who had kids and needed to get home because they had not planned to spend almost 4 hours for dinner. Oh and the couple that had a kid got a broken booster chair as well. I really wish there was negative stars for this exact situation. Just a horrible time. Never going back to any Cheesecake Factory again."
Erick ..,"Foster City, CA",52,125,17,2.0,10/21/2005,"Nice place for a family restaurant though a bit loud, contemporary decor with matching menu selections.  Dinner last Tuesday however proved to be a mistake.  My wife ordered her usual crab cake sandwich with their garlic mayo dip rather than tartar sauce, I with my favorite shrimp bistro pasta, mom had pork chops, and dad went with bowtie pasta.  It was also too dark that it was a wonder how we even read the menu.  Of course, you either scarf down that big plate of whatever or take half of it home. We all had leftovers.   My plate could probably feed two.  Mom's should have been named ""mash potato dinner with 2 sides of pork chops,"" which was too rubbery dry by the way. Our lunch experiences were better when you can see what you're eating.  You can also ask for the lunch portion and get half the volume and leave enough room for some dessert if you can handle that big slice of cheesecake.  If you haven't yet, do give it a try during lunch hours between Mondays and Thursdays when the wait isn't bad.  The same goes with their San Francisco location believe it or not."
Christian S.,"San Francisco, CA",129,198,5,1.0,10/10/2006,I am probably not the only person on Yelp who complains about the long f**king wait at this hell hole - Food is actually pretty average especially if you are hungry. Cheesecakes are over the top and are very yummy - imo. You ask why one star then? Try waiting for a table at this establishment - you will understand the lone yellow star. if you want cheesecake - try going on a tuesday afternoon -
AhLin C.,"San Francisco, CA",127,575,6,3.0,8/6/2007,"Food was great and up to par like the other Cheesecake Factories.  The service was really just so-so, and I knocked off 1 star.  My favorite dishes are: Roadside Sliders Quesidilla Meatloaf"
Lisa M.,"Sausalito, CA",35,320,2,3.0,9/13/2007,"I have basically have only come here for co worker functions and large parties.  I have been here 3x.  The service sort of sucked- very slow- takes a long time to get what you ask for- I think the servers are overwhelmed or something...I can dig it. I do have to say, however, that their banana creme pie cheesecake is great.  Order it with hot fudge sauce on the side. mmmmm!"
Albert C.,"Campbell, CA",85,473,21,3.0,12/26/2007,"Pretty standard fare with a wide variety of lunch and dinner choices and really good dessert. Favorite entrees include the Chinese chicken salad, the spicy crispy chicken sandwich and Joe's special omelette. Most of their entrees are large enough to share (or for two meals), which appeals to my cash-strapped sensibilities. Among the cheesecakes, I like the fresh strawberry and the chocolate Oreo mudslide. The PA location is well-situated in downtown and parking can be found fairly easily on surrounding streets, except on weekends. Lines here can be rather long though, especially on weekends."
Ronda F.,"Discovery Bay, CA",3,23,2,2.0,7/5/2008,"What a disappointment. We were celebrating a birthday with family of 5 adults and 3 children. We had reservations so had no wait for a table. Unfortunately, the rest of the evening took forever. Waitress took our drink orders immediately, but we then waited a good 30 minutes for delivery - adults orders came first, children's 10 minutes later. During this time we placed our food orders and then waited another 30+ minutes for food to arrive. Adults entrees came first - then the salads - all at once. The servers practically slammed the plates down. Another 20 minutes and then the kids food was delivered. The mac and cheese for the 5 year old was so hot he couldn't eat it and the bowl was too hot to touch. We asked for the manager and he came over full of apologies and a couple of free pieces of cheesecake for dessert.  I called to complain to main office and they sent a $20 gift card as a way of apology. Not much considering how much was spent that evening. I've been several times to the Cheesecake Factory in Sawgrass Mills in Florida - never a bad experience. This was so bad I will not return and gave my gift card to a friend. Huge disappointment."
Naji E.,"Millbrae, CA",11,122,17,5.0,5/23/2010,"My favorite restaurant by far!  Must try the Pasta Da Vinci or the Lousiana Chicken Pasta.  Very good.  I drink alot of soda, their large soda cups make for constant drinking with your meal.  I hate having dinner somewhere and waiting for refills.  This factory is extremely large and most of the time, I haven't had to wait."
Roy Z.,"Palo Alto, CA",18,4,,5.0,6/21/2012,"I have been there many times and I have to say that overall the restaurant is a very nice one. The service is fast, the waiters are very kind and will listen to your needs. There is a wide range of foods and it is all great quality. Dishes I recommend are: Pasta DaVinci, Americana Burger(or any other burger), the buffalo wings, and the crispy fried cheese. The best place to sit is probably the dining room, so ask for it. The music is sometimes too loud and it gets a little dark, but nonetheless it is a great place to eat."
