April F.,"San Jose, CA",65,69,163,2.0,4/25/2006,"Every single time I go to this cheesecake factory, there's a wait. One time, the host/hostesses made my friend and I wait even though there was no one else to be seated!! There's this one waitress, Elizabeth, that was HORRIBLE. She made me wait like 1 HOUR for my food, and when I told her I just wanted to go and didn't want it anymore she said ""Oh it should be coming out soon, let me check."" And brought my food...cold. it was COLD. C-O-L-D. wtf,!? Why the hell is it cold and why the hell did I wait an hour for that!? jeebus... Another time I was there, I was seated at the bar with co-workers. First, they wouldn't let me sit on one side of the booth but insisted that I have the one RIGHT NEXT TO it instead -__-; So we sat there...and waited for our waitress to come. It would be understandable if the place was swarming with people but it was like mid-afternoon, around 4pm. And we sat...and watched our waitress flirt with the busboy and run her hands all over him...wth. That is so unsanitary. To reliterate, the food is decent. If you have the chance, try their Lemon Herb Roasted Chicken, great portion and the carrots are amazing. Some of their pasta is good too but its a bit on the oily side. They have delicious cheesecakes (esp. the white chocolate raspberry one, mmMmm). At this location, however, the service does it no justice. Go to the one in SF or even Valley Fair, they make the experience better.  Oh, good drinks too..decent mojitos."
Eric M.,"Sacramento, CA",211,89,2,2.0,12/25/2006,"I enjoy Cheesecake Factory, and have eaten at many of them. Their portions are huge, but at least you can get a couple meals out of them. I especially enjoy the cocktails. They're always tasty and strong, and I always get a bit tipsy off of them. Every Cheesecake Factory has a bit of a wait time to be seated. That's fine. However, this particular location has extremely slow service. The waiter kept telling us he would be right back...20 minutes later he showed up. Luckily my friend and I both had a strong cocktail and bread to entertain us.   The locations in San Jose are much better, in my experience."
Jennifer A.,"Hayward, CA",234,679,29,2.0,12/2/2011,"Its usually difficult to get into this restaurant, so when we came early on Friday night at 6pm and there was not wait in the lobby we just knew we would get in and get out..WRONG! The hostess let us know it would be a 15-20 minute wait..Um okaay I guess its super busy in the dining area. They had happy hour in the bar area, but my companions opted to wait for a table instead. Here is the kicker...After our 15 minute wait, guess where we were seated??? THE BAR!!! Are you serious? We could have sat ourselves there earlier? The dining area wasn't even full..So that set the tone..Of course the server made up for that debacle..She was friendly, attentive and all that warm and fuzzy stuff...I ordered the caramel chicken dish..Soo Sooo good..Husband ordered the Navajo sandwich and that was a total bust..Chicken had no flavor, like literally you needed to douse it with some salt/ ranch and more ranch..Well at least my meal was good..Overall I never have a bad experience when we are fortunate enough to get in, but this time it was just a mixed bag of ups and downs."
Jessie W.,"San Jose, CA",17,43,,2.0,2/5/2008,"There is something that irks me about cheesecake factory. It is the long wait? The huge chain? The ads on their menus? The ridiculous portions? Honestly, I don't know why it's so popular. The food is greasy and overpriced and the portions are enormous! Who can eat that much? And their normal healthy considerate portions are labeled ""weight management."" It's scary to think how many calories their regular entries are if a 500+ calorie salad is considered ""weight management"" The cheesecakes is not any better than the prolific oven cheesecake.  The only thing i love about cheesecake factory are the avocado eggrolls. SO GOOD. But that's about it. Anything else i've ordered here is ususually good for the first bite or so, then if you continue eating you get sick of the flavors and you get that greasy feeling that settles in with a little time...and you don't even want to finish your leftovers because you still don't feel like eating the greasy food you just had from last night.  The service i've found to be extremely inconsistent. Sometimes i get service so excellent that the waiters actually make me smile, and are consistently available for my needs. Other times i've had rude servers who make me wait and make it difficult for me to make requests. I've decided to just come here as a guilty pleasure very rarely only when I'm craving the avocado eggrolls. Otherwise there are many other restaurants to choose from that are better."
Jeff N.,"San Lorenzo, CA",4,31,,1.0,6/15/2009,"I have eaten here three times and each time got progressively worse.  Last night I ordered the chicken carbonara and the noodles were undercooked (and consequently hard chewy) and the sauce was extremely watery. To top it all off the service was bad.  The waiter seemed miserable living his own life, which resulted in negligent service.   I will NEVER eat at the cheesecake factory again in my entire life.  Their cheesecakes are still good, but everything else is seriously awful."
Andrea G.,"Daly City, CA",58,109,8,2.0,3/2/2007,"Why do we continue to come here for lunch during work? Whenever there's a big group of us for lunch we make reservations. They only take reservations before 11:45am, which I find strange. Anyway, a few days ago we made reservations for 11:40am. The ten of us arrived at our reservation time and had to wait. The place was pretty empty at this point. We waited about 15-20min while groups just as large as ours and who came AFTER us were given their tables. We complained to the hostess and apparently she had forgotten about us and given our table to another group. Lovely.  In a nutshell, the service here sucks.  It takes forever for them to take our order and even longer for them to bring out our food. Two hours later, we had just ordered our cheesecakes to go and were waiting for our bill. They brought out half the desserts in about 10min and assured us that the rest were ""coming right out."" 30min later the rest of our cheesecakes were still missing and no one had brought us our check. How long does it take to box a slice of cheesecake??? Frustrated, our group walked up to the front.  There were our cheesecakes sitting on the counter.  It's a shame - I don't think we're going back here for a long time. The cheesecakes are really good and the portions are huge, but they don't make up for the poor service."
Christine P.,"Daly City, CA",80,401,285,3.0,1/7/2010,"i've never been a real hard core fan of cheesecake factory. the one thing i do like about it is that if you're in a big group, there's something for everyone, but in this lies the catch-22: there's something for everyone but it's never the ""best you've ever had."" i'll admit, it's decent. i could probably make a cheesecake just as good at home (if not better), and the prices are reasonable. but if you're counting on a 1.5 hour lunch, this is the place to go. extremely slow."
Michelle N.,"Menlo Park, CA",4,34,3,2.0,1/28/2012,The food is standard Cheesecake Factory food but the service is absolutely horrible.  We asked for water 4 times throughout our meal and got it right before we got our check.  We also only had 4 place settings so we asked twice for 2 more settings.  We got them after our meals were delivered.  The server dropped a knife on the ground and never brought another knife back so we had to share a knife between two people.
Dan W.,"San Carlos, CA",55,91,2,4.0,9/15/2008,"i am easy to please.  it's been about 6 months since i last came here but the food/service has been consistenly good.  had a sangria-little too much ice but the wine was good.  i banged my head into the display case as i was drooling looking at all those cheesecakes. peanut butter, banana creme, oreo....uhhhh, its killing me as i can't have any. i ordered a combo of steak and salmon.  cooked/ seasoned just right big servings with a huge side of homemade mash potatoe.  bread basket was filled with a nice mix of french bread and rye. prices are reasonable, good food so check it out"
Jessica B.,"San Francisco, CA",21,118,,4.0,6/11/2007,"I usually avoid Cheesecake Factory by the plague. I hate that you can't make a reservation and that there is ALWAYS a wait. But my boyfriend is obsessed and has been bugging me to go so I finally gave in and we went. Even at 8pm there was a wait for dinner, but 20 minutes isn't too bad I guess.  Say what you will about the Cheesecake Factory, but there is definitely something for everybody on that menu. The thing is like 20 pages long. Even if you removed the ads (annoying but a brilliant business move on their part) it would still be a 10+ page menu. Salads, sandwiches, pastas, main courses, you won't leave hungry. And despite what seems like high prices, you really get what you pay for. A $14 salad is sure to leave you with another meal tomorrow and $3 for extra chicken buys you a whole chicken breast's worth.  The best part about our experience was our fantastic waiter Alex. Alex was quick to take our drink order, checked back frequently until we were ready to order, was totally on top of the refills, easily split our check 4 ways, and did it all with a smile. A bad waiter can ruin even the best food, so Alex really made all the difference. I'd been dreading our dinner, but I really was pleasantly surprised. I'm still knocking off one star because I still dread waiting for a table."
Honor G.,"San Francisco, CA",130,74,,5.0,12/8/2007,"The best looking Cheesecake factory I'd say.  It has very high ceilings and the decor is very flashy compared to other Cheesecake factories.  It's easier to get seating here also after the busy times like, after 7-8.  The bar area is much nicer also.  Order 1-Thai Wraps 2-Avocado Eggrolls 3-Calamari  and you're done.  One thing I don't appreciate about Cheesecake factory in general though is the fact that they don't advertise their drink prices. (This must be illegal no?) then they charge 8 dollars for a beer or mixed drink."
Joy M.,"Woodburn, OR",0,6,,1.0,6/15/2013,"A friend and I went to this restaurant because we wanted a nice salad for dinner.  First of all the waitress told us the soup of the day was cream of chicken and left the menus.  We just wanted a salad and a cup of soup.  She told us the soup wasn't ready (it was about 5:30 p.m.) and it would be about 30 more minutes.  It was fairly crowded so you'd think they'd have the 'soup of the day' so we said we just have the salads.  The salads that were brought to us were snack salads, clearly a screwup by the waitress which she admitted to, but rather than make it right she asked if they would be enough.  She made a comment that the cooks don't care, etc.  So I asked to talk to the manager and he was so apologetic and said he'd go back and have them made for us right away.  It was a joke.  We ordered the Grilled Chicken, Endive, Radicchio, Arugula, Butter Lettuce, Roasted Pear, Blue Cheese, Candied Pecans and Tomato Served with a Low-Cal Vinaigrette.  We received this huge mound of lettuce and literally searched the mound for any chicken or pear.  I found 4 tiny pieces of pear, two pecans and a few small thin slices of chicken.  I didn't have any bleu cheese.  I couldn't believe he seriously delivered these to us.  We dug around and had a very few bites of pear and chicken but the longer I dug the more digusted I got.  So he came over several minutes after delivering these jokes and was so apologetic, took the salads off our check and that was that.  I still can't believe what they brought to our table.  It was right to take these off of our checks but that's not the point.  And the manager had the guts to say he was surprised because they're known for their salads.  We won't darken their doorway again."
N G.,"Pleasanton, CA",6,123,,3.0,4/19/2010,"Nothing remarkable in terms of the food. Bland, mass produced, generic, and fattening. The decor is very fancy and grand which does not match the caliber of the food. It is also very pricey. I recommend trying to find a nice French bistro if you are in to this kind of food. You will pay less and be supporting a small business, instead of a franchise."
Dustin G.,"Portland, ME",325,204,37,3.0,9/17/2009,why is it that people line up to the gills for just ok fare.. i dont get it but you know somehow this franchise just knows how to get them in bustling through the doors...cheap food..well prepared.. and an extensive cheesecake list!  One might say that the cheesecake is the reason why you come here but really the food is not bad at all.. some of my favorites are the crab cakes and miso salmon! The quality of the food is the same as the other locations but somehow i love the service out of this one the best.  the servers are well trained and very attentive.  3/5 judosniffs.
Ssrr B.,"Belmont, CA",0,13,,4.0,6/3/2012,We come here often and really like the food and service. It's a chain but we don't care. We always had good experiences bringing family and friends
Huey K.,"San Francisco, CA",667,297,3,2.0,11/8/2008,The best place to have dinner conversation is while waiting in an incredibly long line.  I'd come here if I were with a group of picky eaters.  The extensive menu ensures that everyone gets to choose a mediocre meal.  Then I'd get some new friends...
T G.,"Redwood City, CA",0,12,,5.0,3/6/2012,"Wow!  love the food, and I am a food critic, any cheesecake is good.  Great indoors and the waiters really try hard to accomodate even is crowded.  Parking is like you know sometimes hard on University.  But over all,  I love walking afterswards downtown Palo Alto.  great place to go with family too."
g s.,"San Jose, CA",8,141,3,4.0,11/12/2011,Love the Cheesecake factory.  Nice dining and bar area.  Great service and food selection and quality is tops.
Stefano S.,"Fremont, CA",5,26,,2.0,9/1/2008,"How the hell did this place get approval to be built in Downtown PA? Go anywhere else but here. Absolutely abysmal & mediocre food (and a lot of it! the american way) and attracts the worst people (EPA). Hope it burns down, or something."
Christopher C.,"San Francisco, CA",0,1,,1.0,1/30/2013,"One star for the raspberry lemonade.... My partner & I stopped at CF on Univ. Ave in PA last Sunday afternoon and sat at one of the outside tables (we had our dog with us). A waiter, a young guy who identified himself as Glen, came with the menus and took our beverage orders. At this point I should mention that the waiter, though friendly enough, seemed kind of out of it... we both thought maybe he was stoned or perhaps been out all night previous... or both. My partner's drink arrived in about 5 minutes. After another 10 minutes a different (waitress) arrived and asked if she could take our drink orders. I told her that I had ordered a raspberry lemonade from the first waiter but it hadn't arrived yet. Then she took our lunch orders and said that she would check on my drink. My raspberry lemonade arrived fairly quickly, but after yet another 20 minutes or so, another waitress arrived at our table and asked if she could take our lunch order. We told her that we had already ordered about 20 minutes earlier from a different waitress; she then said that she would check inside. This is the last we saw of any of these 3 servers. Meanwhile we waited another 15-20 minutes at which time we asked a fourth employee (who was clearing a table nearby) to check on our food as we now had been sitting at our outside table for a good 45 minutes; we also asked her to bring the manager. A few minutes later, the manager arrived (don't recall his name, but was a friendly, youngish Asian)... he seemed genuinely apologetic about it all, and in fact offered us our lunch on the house. By now though, my partner was really itching to leave, so we said thank you... no (I think we were really afraid of spending yet another hour waiting for food to arrive). I'm not a big fan of chain restaurants and been to CF only a couple times before in other cities (Chicago & Aventura-FL) but had good service, so was caught off-guard by what happened in Palo Alto. Needless to say, we won't be coming back to CF in PA."
