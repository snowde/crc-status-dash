Shirley E.,"South San Francisco, CA",23,35,,5.0,8/21/2009,"I have been to the cheesecake factory in downtown San Francisco and enjoyed it because of the view but the one in Palo Alto has great service and a beautiful interior. I went with my boyfriend to celebrate our anniversary and we were seated right away and our waiter came right after to give us bread and butter. Our seats were comfy and the inside looked like designs that belonged in a church, gorgeous!!! We both had steak, which was juicy, tender and full of flavor. I got red velvet cake to go and ate it a couple of hours later and it was great. I would definitely come back here and recommend it to others."
Sara J.,"Fairfax, CA",490,435,21,4.0,2/28/2008,"Yes the portions are huge, yes it's a little pricey (although not all that pricey when you take into account the huge portions), yes there are ads in the menu (so weird!) but I kinda like this place. The trick is to get a food item that will last for a day and then cutting whatever you order in half to save the rest for tomorrow. You could do this if you ordered a burger, or eggrolls etc etc. Alas I was craving a salad, which doesn't keep very well, so I ended up eating most of it. It was tasty though. My friend ordered an omlette which hit the spot for him. One thing I like about this place is that they have all different types of food (mexican, asian etc) and they do it all decently well. That's pretty impressive for a chain restaurant."
Julianne M.,"Millbrae, CA",19,10,2,3.0,4/28/2010,Typical Cheesecake Factory.  Our waiter was pretty friendly and refilled my coffee faster than I could drink it.  Portions were great for the price but food was bland.  Nothing I wouldn't expect from a chain.  I dont really think you can mess up cheesecake.  Especially cherry...yum!
Windy C.,"San Jose, CA",14,50,,2.0,10/6/2011,"I like cheesecake factory, but this one is bad.  Slow service for every part of their service and their food is not consistent with other chains.  I expect mega-chains to have consistent flavor but no.  Our Tex Mex egg rolls were undercooked (doughy inside) and the corn kernels inside were wrinkly, chewy and transluscent.  It tasted like someone had taken freezer burned rolls, left them out to thaw for 30 mins and THEN fried them.  It was bad."
Stuart L.,"Palo Alto, CA",6,16,,4.0,9/2/2009,"Another staple in the area, one of the only decent places that opens late-ish in the night.  Cheesecakes are awesome, and the meals are pretty decent.  A little more expensive if you're on a student budget, but it's nice to go once in a while."
D E.,"Palo Alto, CA",104,33,,4.0,8/25/2009,"I love the Cheesecake Factory!  The one in Palo Alto is the one I have went to most and the food is always excellent and the service is always very good.  J.W. Lemonade is my signature drink - and yum, is all I can say.  Prices are steep, but the portions are GIGANTIC!  Every birthday I go here and I always recommend this place for birthday for others.  When you order the food catered (my work orders from a delivery service) -- the food has always been very cold and is not even close to what I'm getting when I go to the restaurant - so I do not recommend ordering take out or delivery from CF."
Retired B.,"Los Angeles, CA",570,1888,1488,3.0,8/9/2008,"We came again for the National Cheesecake Day... and were early enough to sit at the bar and order off the bar menu... which has items at $4-5 each. (4-6 PM everyday) We tried the: fried mac & cheese  avocado rolls  ahi tuna tempura rolls  cuban sandwiches  and cheesecake of course for $1.50. Everything was great and tasty, I asked for the wheat bread and they gave it to me without hesistation. Best part of the night, our bill for two people came out to be $22 and we were more than full!"
David D.,"Palo Alto, CA",0,2,,1.0,5/16/2008,How Greed Destroys A Great Concept: Growing up in Los Angels this was the place my parents always took us to when cooking wasn't on the family agenda.After having a horrible experience and going into the companies Web site to voice my experience.I was over taken by the total loctions it now has across this country.You guys sold out and have comprimised what was once a great product.Spread to Thin with not enough talent to carry the load.This reflects from the teenage host-untrained waiter-poor food product and must not we forget managers who sould be working in a shoe store.You sold out and I hope it bites you in the ass.I lost a good childhood memory to greed !!!!!!!!!!
Angela H.,"San Mateo, CA",70,343,1,3.0,5/3/2009,"Oh no. What am I doing at a chain restaurant? And problematic because I used to boycott this location because of a lousy service incident. What to do? Evidently, go back, on your birthday, and be proven wrong. This one is less crowded/loud than Santana Row's and atop Macy's in SF, though it was 9 on a Wednesday night. I had a really delicious Asian Pear Martini. Yum. Our waiter was on top of things. Also had stuff from the new small bites menu; artichoke and bacon-wrapped dates were yummy. I'm still a fan of the key lime and the godiva cheesecake. It was good. Nice little birthday Sundae, too. Color me surprised."
Kristine D.,"Mountain View, CA",132,724,517,1.0,3/1/2008,"Between the Vegas-buffet sized line to get in and the glazed food coma expressions on the faces of those customers waddling out of the place, I think the Cheesecake Factory should be charged with poisoning American arteries! I'll admit that I have overindulged there myself but, I became a bit turned off by the place after a trip to San Francisco during Christmas time where I encountered a line for this place that could rival one for Hannah Montana tickets!  There are so many awesome, amazing, wonderful, classic places to eat in the city and people were choosing to stand in a line and wait infinitely to eat a platter of trans-fat disguised as a sandwich!!! Come on people!"
Darius A.,"San Bruno, CA",29,620,34,5.0,6/7/2009,Great food for a good price. They have my favorite beer on tap so it deserves 5 stars.
Shooter M.,"Santa Clara, CA",5,192,5,2.0,1/12/2009,"This restaurant is for people that really don't know better. I find the demographic interesting too, it's predominantly one race of people whom shall go unnamed. Anyways I guess what's popular ""must be good."" As for me I will be looking for a place that doesn't have little pieces of food stuck to the menu and a fork that doesn't look like somebody just licked it after eating a piece of disgusting cheesecake. I'll take a pass."
Hollis L.,"Cambridge, MA",31,10,,2.0,9/12/2008,"I think you know what to expect from this restaurant from many of the other reviews already written here, but I'd just like to reinforce their sentiment and add some personal anecdotes of my own. Yes, the portions are big, there's no arguing with that.  However, I would describe the quality of the food as mediocre at best.  For example, the avocado rolls are extremely bland.  Yes, they're loaded with avocado, but that's all you really taste.  It's as if you were just eating huge chunks of unseasoned avocado by itself.  Admittedly, I can't speak to the quality of the cheesecake. Don't get me wrong, I've really wanted to like this place.  However, I was here for a friend's birthday a year ago, and I surreptitiously asked the waitress if Cheesecake Factory could do anything special for her birthday.  They said they would prepare a special dessert for her, etc.  Great, fine.  I reminded her TWICE throughout the course of the evening, and each time she assured me that she remembered and that she was on top of it.  By the time the check had come and we were getting up to go, she just gave us a ""Thank you, goodbye"".  It wasn't even on a weekend. I'm sure there are many, many better places in Palo Alto to eat.  The fact that they don't take reservations and the line is often long is a total pain, as well."
Richard T.,"San Jose, CA",18,91,1,2.0,6/4/2009,"I have to say, I refrained from posting the first time, but the second time made it too ridiculous to let it slide.  The first time I went to Cheesecake at this location, my chicken dish was raw in the middle, a little forgiveable if possible considering its a whole piece of chicken.  However, the second time, my gf's chicken salad with small slices of chicken were totally raw!!  Both times management comped it, but it did little to restore any type of confidence.  I won't be back to this location again and it's unfortunate because I do like the general chain Cheesecake Factory.  I haven't had problems at other locations before, but maybe they just need to get some quality control going on at this one.   Waiters and management are nice here, but I just can't ignore raw chicken...TWICE!"
David S.,"Milpitas, CA",29,132,1,4.0,8/8/2008,I think of this place as a Max's on Drugs (in a good way) This menu is bigger than Max's but the same kind of flavor. Very big portions of pretty good food. This place is a place you have to check out if you have never been. I have not had the dessert but I have heard it is supposed to be good.  Worth checking out.
wheatberry s.,"Palo Alto, CA",15,176,1,3.0,4/5/2009,Ended up eating near the bar where service is quicker. Needed to eat in 30 minutes and it was accomplished despite Cheesecake's notorious long wait. I had a lunch combo and it was alright. The serving of salmon was generous (6 oz) but they gave only 5 broccoli florets. Boo. Service was attentive. Cheesecake will always be Cheesecake - predictable yet tasty food.
Sarah B.,"Vallejo, CA",23,11,15,3.0,12/28/2008,"Went here last Friday for a friend's birthday. I tried their fried mac n cheese and avocado egg rolls, they were delish! A serious comfort food! For entree, I tried one of their specials, the salisbury steak. I wouldn't say it was great, but good. The staff was very friendly. I wouldn't mind trying this place out again =)"
Rod M.,"San Francisco, CA",174,864,564,3.0,4/1/2009,"Cheesecake is what it is , you either love it , hate it, or will go with it (that's my group). I do like the chocolate warm bread and I like this Palo Alto location because it doesn't seem to get as crowded as the other locations in the Bay (Pleasanton, Valley Fair etc)."
Right A.,"Del Mar, CA",0,65,,5.0,9/29/2011,"Much, much friendlier than the Walnut Creek location! Wait times are decent, service is great."
Brian W.,"Santa Clara, CA",30,232,,3.0,4/5/2009,"My experiences with Cheesecake factory over the years has not been stellar.  The major obvious problem is that they do not take reservations. Other observations I've had are that if you have a large party (greater than 6), they will ALWAYS seat you last no matter what. They promise you the world and will always say, we are waiting for this last table that won't get up. Please! I've heard this excuse at EVERY location from SF to SJ.  But, the reason why I continue going here is the food. I wasn't disappointed with my  order of Shrimp and Chicken Gumbo. Also, the server we had last night was really nice and our food came quick. If you can stand the wait, come here. Also, it seemed like this location isn't as crowded as Valley Fair or Downtown SF."
