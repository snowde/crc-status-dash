A M.,"Stanford, CA",11,144,9,1.0,9/12/2010,The ushers at the front as you enter are relatively polite; the waiters are not.  The lighting is pathetically dim.  When asked to turn on the lights they bring a candle which makes no difference in the lighting.  The waiter tried very very hard to get us to buy more cheesecake.  Nice place for a late night cheesecake snack if you're ready for the calorie bomb.  ~25$ if you get a meal.  My food came burnt.
Sandie D.,"San Francisco, CA",3,18,15,4.0,3/31/2009,I don't like to wait to be seated so  I order My Ahi-Tuna at the bar while watching ESPN ...simply Delicious
S O.,"San Francisco, CA",5,126,,3.0,3/27/2009,"I like their appetizers and their bread.  I really like their skirt steak with mashed potatoes and fries - it's really the only thing worth getting on the menu for me.  The ironic thing is that their cheesecake really isn't very good.  Other then that, this place is overrated but it's fun to come here and split food with the bf or friends."
Jane T.,"Palo Alto, CA",0,14,,1.0,5/22/2010,"The worst restaurant ever, the building itself is atrocious. I went here once I promise to never return, The food is overpriced fast food and the portions are HUGE (completely unhealthy). Also the service is terrible."
Ramon G.,"Daly City, CA",0,10,,2.0,9/5/2011,"used to love this place, and now....it is a joke, service is horrible  food horrible, and really i am shocked that the place i been going for years can change so much in a matter of one year....wow......i would not recomend it for BD to anyone, maybe lunch is still ok, ,but do not invide guests there."
Howie W.,"Palo Alto, CA",2,27,,2.0,2/12/2009,"This Cheesecake Factory is just like any other Cheesecake Factory the world over (look up ""it is what it is"" in the dictionary and you'll see The Cheesecake Factory and Sanjaya Malakar), except for committing the cardinal sin of taking up prime Palo Alto real estate in lieu of something  interesting.   If you have to go, the ""chicken madeira"" (it's not your grandma's chicken madeira!) is actually strangely good.  My wife likes the ""mojitos,"" (not approved by Fidel) because they make it ridiculously sweet.  But seriously, Cheesecake Factory, why are you here? Please go to Vallco in Cupertino, which could use the business."
kalani O.,"Palo Alto, CA",151,74,15,4.0,7/11/2006,I cant even front on the carrot cake/cheese cake that shit was off the hook. I would also like to add that I refused to use a fork for this dining experience.
Ginny M.,"San Francisco, CA",51,123,,3.0,1/30/2009,"I attended a baby shower here. We had appetizers and cheesecake. I also had a peach bellini. The flavor was good. However, this is a blend ice drink and the ice cubes were not that well blended. The appetizers were on par with other places. I had the low carb cheesecake. I know this sounds like sacrilege but remember this is low carb not low fat. It was pretty good and did like the splenda after taste in my mouth. I actually did finish the whole piece which I normally can never do."
Mary T.,"Sunnyvale, CA",38,652,89,3.0,2/18/2008,"This was our third stop on the Monday night venue hopping adventure, and we came here specifically for dessert. I had a decaf cappuccino, and we three split the tuxedo. It was pretty good, but the place is kinda small and the service wasn't the best."
Stan H.,"San Francisco, CA",13,127,277,3.0,2/1/2009,"Although it's a chain restaurant, Cheescake Factory has always been great. Not spectacular but great. The decor is the standard Cheescake Factory marble and large seats. The food is always good and the portions are generous, but the service can be slow. They are more than willing to help you when they're available. It can only get worst if it wasn't Super Bowl Sunday, so be warned. The lack of quick and attentive service is why I only gave this location three stars. Me and my group had the Kobe Burger, Thai Chicken Pasta and I had the Chicken Bellagio. They were all exceptional (with just the right amount of flavor and richness) and we had to bring the pastas home to finish. The avocado egg rolls were VERY good and the tamarind sauce was just right, but it didn't let me finish my entree.  The deserts are standard Cheescake Factory as well, but that doesn't mean they're bad. Every cheescake is good in their own ways, as was the Godiva Chocolate Cheescake. Subtle flavors and large portions are always a good thing."
Sharon H.,"Redwood City, CA",42,173,88,3.0,2/1/2009,"We would not normally go to a place like this. The portions are way to big but we had a gift card to spend so we decided what the heck.We went early as we know Palo Alto can be crazy. It was already almost full at 5pm. The appetizers were good. The guys wanted wings and I wanted the won-tons. The wings lacked the usual acidity. The crab won-tons were good. The meals arrived and I was already full. The bolognese was mediocre( I think I have made better with a bottle of Bertoli.) and it was no where as good as the Fromani meat sauce from Costco. My husband said his Spicy Cashew Chicken was to heavy on a salty sauce.  My 8 year old on the other hand who has never had Wagyu and Arugula like us loved his dinner and said that his cheescake was"" the chocolate god of all chocolate cheescake."" and he gave it 5 stars. The desserts were good..Ok..I did not get cheesecake. I got the lemocello that weirdly enough I had eaten and Barnes and Noble before. It was very yummy but way to big. All three of us brought exactly half of our dinners and our desserts home. We have all tucked into the leftovers today. Ok to visit once every 2-3 years but I think if I am in Palo Alto I will stick with Tamarine."
Lindsay S.,"Sacramento, CA",64,108,110,3.0,3/14/2007,"Gluttony and excess....that pretty much sums up the cheese cake factory from top to bottom.  The building is a Vegas style monstrosity that imposes upon the not-so-quaint Palo Alto downtown (I have a love hate relationship with the atmosphere here).  The menu is similarly imposing....at 15 pages or so I am never able to make a decision in under 15 minutes.  I am usually satisfied with whatever I end up ordering...but rarely blown away.  Still....the cheesecakes are always divine...and at 1700 calories a slice (yes, one of the employees revealed this truth about the Godiva chocolate cheesecake) it sure better be."
Kristy T.,"Cupertino, CA",3,11,,2.0,6/20/2008,Wow the star rating bar said 'meh' even before I can type it. My feelings exactly.
Flo P.,"Washington, DC",5,20,,3.0,5/9/2006,"Went on a Monday for lunch.  There was no wait and they weren't very busy, but the service was incredibly slow.  The food was decent, but nothing to write home about.  Your best bet is to eat anywhere else on University Ave. and then stop by for a slice of cheesecake to go."
Laura W.,"San Francisco, CA",2,24,,4.0,1/7/2009,"4 stars for successfully seating 22 people without a reservation for lunch AND not messing up the orders! The waiters were very attentive and accommodating for such a large group. -1 star for too much wasted food, do the entrees really have to be that big??"
Yb W.,"Boston, MA",10,158,25,4.0,6/6/2008,"I am not ashamed to admit that I love chain restaurants and visit them often. I truly believe that what they lack in authenticity and originality, they more than compensate for in terms of mass appeal and price. Chain restaurants can afford to serve larger portions simply because they buy in larger quantities--this is, after all, the basis of Walmart's and Costco's success.  Boutique restaurant snobs may find the prospect of mass-produced food off-putting, but I appreciate the consistency of preparation and reliable flavors.   The Cheesecake Factory is the mother of all chain restaurants. Its huge popularity and large profits has allowed the company to populate suburbs and cities all over the country. I have been to several Cheesecake Factory restaurants across the West Coast, and they all have the extravagance of a casino lobby in Las Vegas.  The restaurant in Palo Alto is no exception. I half-expected to find slot machines in between the bakery and the bar. Actually, they might consider installing them to help pass the two hour-plus wait time for a table on a weekend evening. The source of the popularity is of course the large variety of dishes served and their signature, uber dense and decadent cheesecakes. The fact that the portions served could have single-handedly caused the current obesity epidemic is another reason. I once ordered a half sandwich and salad combo, anticipating a light lunch. The ""half"" sandwich was as big as my head and the salad looked like it came from a whole head of Romaine lettuce. Had I cleaned my plate, I would have died of a food coma. But, as long as we are a society of gluttons (I know I have no self-control), the Cheesecake Factory empire will continue to expand, and will soon join the ranks of McDonalds and Starbucks."
Jimmy N.,"Anaheim, CA",565,767,159,3.0,8/31/2008,"like any other cheesecake factory... except this one was on the small scale. portions still as big as ever.. i didn't know that the lunch portions - as cheap as the meal could be - was still as humongous as dinner portions! definitely got my money's worth. waiters were kind of cute too.  nice eating for groups and kinda cool to know that a wide variety of people come here - from young entrepreneurs of facebook to older executives to corporate buildings nearby. the only thing i didn't like was the service from our particular waiter was a tad slow. we asked for checks as soon as we all got our food, because we required separate checks on a business lunch.. and we insisted ""no"" on desserts/etc.. but the waiter kept trying to push them on us."
Robyn C.,"San Bruno, CA",12,62,4,3.0,11/1/2007,"I love the decor in the Palo Alto location.  It's kinda tacky and a bit dramtic, but pretty too.  The colors are very soothing.   Food: I think the menu is too large, the portions are also large and the food is average at best.  I've had the same entree 4 times and only once was I satisfied with it. The first time it was delish !   The last time it was so overcooked and dry .  How you can make a curry dish that should have a sauce dry is beyond me, but they managed.  What was my entree hanging out under the prep lights for 3-4 hours???   I have family and friends who love this place, but for me, it's just okay.  Some of the appetizers are yummy but others are just greasy and gross. Service: The service here is about what you'd expect at a chain.  I've been here 4 or five times for birthdays and graduation celebrations.  The last few times against my better judgement, and always with a fairly large crowd.  So perhaps it's been a bad experience because we've always had approximately 10 people, who knows. They really need to train their wait staff before putting them out on the floor.  Perhaps they need to shadow someone who really knows how to treat folks who are paying $50+ bucks a head for appetizers, dinner and a cocktail or two.  Sometimes I think when you come with a large party they dont even try as the tip is automatically added onto the bill.  Even if the service sucked !!!  Perhaps next time I'll try coming here with just one other person and I'll update my review then.  Oh no way can you have appetizers, your meal and cheesecake, it just wont happen.  It's either you come here for dinner or dessert, not both.  OINK!"
Carlie N.,"Durham, NC",10,68,5,3.0,11/18/2008,"Ahhh the Cheesecake Factory, home to generations of Stanford students celebrating their birthdays.  Comme toujours, it has an amazing long, somewhat overwhelming menu, but it definitely has something for everyone.  Their food is usually quite good (with HUGE portions) but steer away from the Pear & Walnut salad ... unless you like hunting for microscopic pieces of nuts and fruit amidst lettuce drenched in dressing. As for this particular location, be prepared to wait for a table, and for your drinks (the bar tends to get backed up)"
Lisha L.,"San Francisco, CA",24,111,2,1.0,11/30/2005,"I ordered some sort of pesto pasta dish.  It was gross and swimming in an entire bowl of olive oil... all for some unreasonable price somewhere between $12 and $15, IIRC.  Maybe I ordered the wrong thing?  Their cheesecake was pretty crappy, too.  For $20, I could think of a million places where I could've had a better fooding experience.  I feel like my cash went entirely into the building..."
