Melinda D.,"Palo Alto, CA",48,200,,3.0,1/16/2006,"The menu offerings are extensive and there is something for everyone. Their portions are generous and well prepared. I recently enjoyed the chicken potpie. Save room for dessert because their cheesecake selection is even better. If only they took reservations, I would eat there more often. The wait time is long on weekend evenings."
Carly M.,"Sunnyvale, CA",28,186,,4.0,4/12/2007,"You get what you expect...It's funny to me that people are lame enough to wait over an hour for a table, then complain about how long the food takes...duh!  If service is what you expect, then go in the afternoon before the dinner rush.  This is when I've experienced the best of everything. Favorite dishes are the Luau salad, tamale cakes, and the white chocolate peanut butter truffle cheesecake."
Eva P.,"Los Altos, CA",0,9,,4.0,4/4/2009,"I like the location and the waiters are normally quite nice. I love the dark bread you get. Well the food...the same everywhere. But last time my friend simply wanted to have a tomato-mozzarella salad but they changed the menu. So the waiter told us she could have her salad. In the end they charged her $ 15 for a small salad although it used to be $ 8.95. The waiter explained that since they officially didn't have the salad anymore they would just charge the most expensive one because of the ""special ingredients"". That's why I only gave 4 stars. Oh and the bathrooms are clean."
Annette A.,"Mountain View, CA",0,12,,2.0,1/24/2009,"My husband had been coming to this place for the Factory burger for years, and had always had a good experience. This was our first time there together and it wasn't a good first impression. We were seated right away, I was a little overwhelmed with the menu and it took me a bit to decide.I went with the chicken parmesan, the chicken was good but the noodles were all stuck together. My husband ordered the The factory burger and couldnt even bite into it because the roll they served it on was so stale, when the waitress noticed that he didnt eat his burger she took it off the bill which was nice;). maybe it was just a bad day?"
Piggy S.,"Menlo Park, CA",15,201,28,3.0,8/14/2008,"Big plates, not that refined food - but tasty enough.  Nice venue for big groups (when we were in college, we did b-day parties at Cheesecake Factory a lot).  I order the chinese chicken salad a lot."
Tisha B.,"Washington, DC",8,180,1,5.0,7/5/2008,"Had GREAT pasta carbonara for lunch for $10 !!  It was fresh and fantastic.  Service was very good.   I have to add this was a late lunch and the place was empty, but I had a very good meal here."
Carol C.,"Palo Alto, CA",0,5,,1.0,1/1/2012,"Worst dinner ever! We ordered the hot crab & artichoke dip- it was coLd & there was no crab, plus it came at the same time our dinner arrived. I asked for them to redo it & serve our dinner later. But the server took it away & took it off the bill. The Thai pasta was salty & overcooked. My daughter ordered the Louisanna chicken pasta, she sent it back. Bad. Nothing like the other cheesecake factories. We were splitting the meal & the server never brought the plates we had to ask someone else. The manager came over, apologized, and offered desert. We told him we were going to buy a cheesecake to take home. He offered to give it to us. When the bill came, they charged us for my daughter's pasta. When I asked the waiter, she said the manager gave us a very small cheesecake. I reminded her it was sent back. Why is the food her substandard. The cheesecake factory in valley fair & Hillsdale are great. What is wrong with this one?"
Marjie T.,"Burlingame, CA",120,488,122,4.0,4/13/2010,"i've forgotten how much i enjoy this place...this is such an easy place to enjoy life's delicious offerings. the service is your typical mainstream restaurant standards...basic & impersonal. the prices are reasonable for the portions. drinks are good, but i still wish they had their frozen hot chocolate...i loved that little oxymoron!"
Julie D.,"Vancouver, WA",187,202,4,2.0,1/3/2008,"My mother in law is in town to visit.  She wants to take my self and my sister in law to lunch before she jets back to Colorado.  I let the sister in law pick the place to eat due to picky eaters.  We arrive and get seated right away.  Our waitress crawls (figuratively) to our table.  She addresses us in the most bored/annoyed tone urging us to make our drink selection 2 seconds after we sat down. Yadda Yadda...Blah Blah Mom in law asks for a mixture of fruit juices, waitress does the typical ""not on the menu, I don't know how to charge that."" Mom in law has to filter and proceeds to ""teach"" waitress how to make her mixture of fruit juice.  Waitress returns with said fruit juice mixture, slams it on the table then proceeds to walk to her register and SLAM her tray down.  (I just wanted a nice stress free lunch...I'm having a panic attack at this point) ""Manager gets involved"" (although the manager is nothing but another server who happened to walk by) We are asked to order AGAIN! (We ordered our meals three times) My meal is cold and totally not what I expected.  Mom in law is afraid to drink her juice mixture.  We pay, we leave (cue hallelujah chorus)"
Veg Gal R.,"San Carlos, CA",122,86,,3.0,9/1/2010,"One of my lovely friends gave me a giftcard for the Cheesecake Factory for $25, so I decided it was time to use it.  I ordered a build your own omelette (spinach, mushrooms, cheese) with breakfast potatoes and an English muffin.  The omelette was very good.  The ingredients were fresh and flavorful, and the omelette was cooked to perfection...not overdone and not runny.  The English muffin was thick and chewy...yummy.  The breakfast potatoes were disappointing...little cubes of boringness.  I also got the red velvet cheesecake to go, as recommended by the waitress.  I had kinda wanted a different one, and should have stuck to my guns.  The oh-so-touted red velvet cheesecake, which sounds exciting, was pretty uninteresting.  Only the cream cheese frosting got my tastebuds dancing.  And ouch for the overall price...breakfast plus cheesecake cost the entire giftcard...no drink or anything else.  I would go back for a special occasion or date, but not on my own for that price."
Lee I.,"San Francisco, CA",2,119,2,3.0,5/31/2010,"My favorite thing to get here is the chicken castelleta(sp?), it's really good and a lot. i must say i was very disappointed with the cheesecake, i had a slice of key lime and it tasted old and the texture was just wrong. probably won't be back anytime soon."
Benjamin M.,"Palo Alto, CA",102,257,18,3.0,1/1/2007,"A great martini and some very expensive food. I come here once in a while for a drink, but not much more. The food is expensive and the atmosphere is good, but I would avoid trying to pariticipate in anything more than a drink."
Parvin P.,"Menlo Park, CA",0,51,,4.0,5/15/2008,"Ah Cheesecake Factory.....yes, it's a chain, and can seem gaudy from the looks of it but at least you know what your getting yourself into. Be assured you will always get HUGE portions here, no matter what you order (that is if you can actually decide something off there 15 page menu). Everything I've ever had here has been 5-9 on a 10 point scale. 9 being the strawberry shortcake dessert---so yummy! I would stay away from the drinks here, they tend to be super sweet with not too much alcohol in them."
DEBBIE M.,"Escondido, CA",44,33,,5.0,4/20/2009,"i love...love...love  all of their cheesecake...everytime i eat here, i gotta have a cheesecake...my meal here will not be completed without any cheesecake in my tummy...ok so i guess i only got one word to desribe this place...""yummmy"""
Nancy B.,"Mountain View, CA",90,229,17,3.0,4/19/2008,Portions are out of this world. It's the place to go if you want to share. It's one of the few chains that I'd actually go to because they have fried macaroni. It's listed under appetizer. You must try it before you dismiss Cheesecake Factories altogether.
Ginger C.,"Daly City, CA",1,53,,3.0,5/2/2008,"I generally hate the Cheesecake Factory, but given the shortage of reasonably priced restaurants in the downtown PA area, I've enjoyed going there for a quick lunch.  On the other hand, given Nathan L's post, maybe I won't go back."
Rob M.,"San Mateo, CA",63,595,14,3.0,6/18/2005,"Holy portion control Batman!  Their plates are fricking HUGE!  Maybe just go for the cheesecake, it's hard to see how you'll have room otherwise after one of their sandwiches."
buttercup r.,"Sunnyvale, CA",43,304,1,3.0,11/5/2006,"Once had a horrible experience with reservations not being honored. Huge portions, reasonable prices, extensive menu, full bar. There are always people in there (though sometimes it gets too crowded and the wait is crazy). Yes, the decor is gimmicky in a Disneyland way, but I'm willing to overlook that."
Waynele Y.,"Honolulu, HI",114,336,16,3.0,11/8/2006,"Thank god hawaii finally got their own cheesecake factory so we can stop eating here when people come to visit us!  the food, including the cheesecake is about average (the cheesecake is too sweet for my palatte, and way overpriced).  This place is definitely over-rated, and though the lines in Palo Alto are not as bad as the ones in the city, still not worth the wait."
Mr. T.,"Belmont, CA",11,86,135,4.0,8/6/2007,we like the brown bread starter and the food was so rich. We were there couple of times and we didn't have to wait. Our experience was good with food. Ambience was awesome man. Seems like fashion show cat walk auditorium.
