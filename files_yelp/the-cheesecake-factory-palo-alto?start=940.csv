Trish P.,"South San Francisco, CA",44,354,,3.0,1/16/2006,This Cheesecake Factory is better than the Union Square location. Though the wait can be long if it's a Friday or Saturday night. Still a little less crowded and touristy..  Portions are huge. I always end up just getting appetizers for dinner cuz I know I won't be able to finish the regular portions.
tisha d.,"San Carlos, CA",19,40,5,4.0,8/23/2006,"Always busy, being a popular chain but the food will not disappoint. Average American food-types and the servings are big too. Of course the main reason i come here or any branch is just to get a cheesecake fix! i don't know if their cakes are the best but the variety and quality are definitely up in the charts somewhere! i cant decide what i like best either (probably the New York or plain) but I'm still in the process of broadening my cheesecake must-haves, rather slowly, for fear of just blowing up like a balloon...(from the hips up) =p"
May A.,"CA, CA",59,188,,3.0,5/17/2007,This location is so much better then the one in SF.  The food is just okay but at least there are no long waits and service is better.
Madalina C.,"Los Altos, CA",162,210,6,3.0,6/30/2007,"This is a nice looking place. The food is ok, depending on what you order. You might be unlucky and order something they don't cook that well. I have only been here once, but I liked it. The food portions are big, so you gotta come hungry...and the place is nice for dressing up. I would come again sometimes."
Alex A.,"San Francisco, CA",10,248,1,3.0,12/2/2007,"The quintessential American restaurant!! Should be in the Lonely Planet it's not a restaurant, it's a sociodemographic study"
Jozy B.,"San Jose, CA",8,72,,2.0,5/8/2008,"Usually I like The Cheesecake Factory, so I was excited when I figured out my co-workers were taking me here for my birthday lunch. I ordered some kind of pasta (btw: they suck for taking pesto one off the menu) and it was very bland and the noodles were a bit over-cooked. Service alone was crap. The waiter took forever to bring our drinks around, not to mention the water. They almost forgot to bring my co-workers meal out and it was a flippin' sandwich. How long does it take to make a sandwich, people? Same with the bill. He was slower than the Slowski's. I do, however, have to applaud them on their cheesecake selection. Mmmm..."
Eric L.,"Redwood City, CA",53,109,,2.0,8/11/2006,"I don't get it.  Why in the hell are people willing to wait over an hour to eat at this place?  Portions are ginormous, the food's OK if you like burgers/fries.  The cheesecakes are quite good, so skip dinner and get dessert to go."
Raj R.,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",36,65,7,3.0,9/5/2009,"lots of food decent price. decent taste too. nice ambiance. too superficial for me. lacks character and personality. i suppose this is a good place to take picky eaters. FYI: if you're getting cheesecake, definitely share."
Tina T.,"Sunnyvale, CA",4,97,,4.0,1/15/2007,"This is just one of those places I've been to so often that it never occurred to me to write a review for it, but I got all teary-eyed today having lunch there after a long hiatus and I wanted to share the highlights and tips about this place that I've accumulated over time.  First off, the wait can be insanely long but if you're open-minded, try one of the first-come, first-serve tables by the bar. It usually cuts the wait down dramatically. Second, the wheat bread in the bread basket is one of the best I've had anywhere so carb-haters beware! Third, you really get a bang out of your bucks because portion size is huge and most folks have another meal for the next day to take home. But choose from the menu carefully. The restaurant handles basics like sandwiches, burgers, and salads fairly well but some of the more ""ethnic"" fare can be risky - too greasy, salty, oily and any other ""-y"" you can think of. This is definitely not the type of place to be too adventurous and exotic with your entree. Ah, forgot to mention, for those who have huge appetities, the appetizers are definitely worth a try. My personal favorite is the firecracker salmon roll (I even tried to replicate them for my wedding!). Finally, the cheesecake is pretty spectacular so make sure to save some room (eat about 1/3 to 1/2 of your entree). And even with the dessert, the portion size is gynormous so one slice should be shared between 2-3 people. If you keep all these rules of thumb in mind, you should have a decent experience!"
three's company M.,"San Jose, CA",8,223,,3.0,11/17/2008,"this cheesecake factory is nice because it is never too busy..i mean you still have to wait, but it's not like SF or Valley Fair.  Right now they have the 30th anniversary cheesecake which is layers of original cheesecake and linda's fudge cake....it is unbelievable!!!  it's the perfect dessert.  we both went for comfort dinners the other night...i got the lemon herb chicken, which was delicious and my hubby got the Shepard's pie.  we were both very pleased.  usually we order the same menu items time after time, so it was fun to get something entirely different.  service was ok.  can't stand the tiny tables that are  right next to other diners....packed in like sardines...can hear all conversations and people stare at your food...and watch you eat...it's a little awkward....i would wait longer just to get a booth because of these reasons.  but, when you're hungry you want to eat and so we just went for it.  service was ok....everything came out fine, but my main complaint is that when packaging up my dinner the *careless* person who boxed it didn't notice that there was a large crack on the bottom of the box and missing part of plastic...he put my meal in there and when i got it home the whole bottom of the bag was sopping wet with juices from the meal and i lifted the box up and my dinner came out the back end!  it was very VERY DISAPPOINTING!!!!!!!  i lost my dinner...some of the chicken went onto the floor as well as some mashed potatoes!  i am so frustrated by people who don't think when they are doing something so simple!  we paid for that dinner....we aren't cheap people, but hey i wanted to eat it and enjoy it!!!!!!  i am going to call cheesecake and let them know and see if I can be given something...as in another piece of that cheesecake?!  hmmm.  i am still disappointed though!"
Catherine R.,"Macedon, NY",0,49,27,4.0,8/17/2009,"I love the teriyaki chicken. The sauce is so great. I always want to try other menu items, but I can't bear to not have my favorite every time. Service is very friendly, though I don't think management should force the servers to offer certain specials or desserts. They are embarrassed when you try to stop them and apologize for having to say stuff you don't want to hear."
Raegan T.,"CA, CA",9,47,,4.0,1/9/2007,"The herb-crusted salmon salad is really fresh and really delicious, but it still feels healthy.  (And I'm telling myself it's fat free...and I don't want to know anything to the contrary.)  Also, their corn cake appetizer with avocado and sour cream and pico de gallo is great.  The portions are huge, but when I'm paying $14 + for a salad, I want to feel like I'm getting my money's worth.  I recommend the Dulce de Leche cheesecake.  It's my fave."
J S.,"Sunnyvale, CA",11,282,,2.0,2/8/2008,Went here at the insistence of my cousin who is a big fan.  Felt it was overpriced.   It was very crowded and we found a place after a long wait.  I ordered some chicken sandwich combo which was filling but not very tasty.  Later we split some cheesecake between 3 of us.  I would rather take out the cheesecake next time.  We could not hear each other in the din.  The damage was some $20 per person.  I will probably not dine in again.
Ronnie W.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,13,,3.0,5/2/2010,Happy that we got a table for three in under 15 mins on a Friday evening. Ordered a shrimp scampi with petite filet which was decent. Service was mediocre as it was hard to get our server's attention to get us a straw which my nephew dropped onto the floor. Street parking is difficult but park in the structure located down the street from the restaurant.
Efi S.,"Palo Alto, CA",0,63,10,2.0,7/20/2007,"It took a long time to serve just a couple of burgers. When they finally came they were cold, hard (along with the fries), and we didn't feel like staying for desert anymore. In all, nothing special. The waiters were friendly at least."
Jenn C.,"San Francisco, CA",0,1,,1.0,3/31/2009,A waiter at the cheesecake factory ran into my daughter with a plate on our way to the restroom. My 7 year old daughter has a black eye and needless to say she was in alot of pain. The waiter felt bad but management did not seem to make a priority of our situation.The restaurant did not even comp our meal or anything!!!! No customer service at all. Please beware when bringing younger children to this location . The wait staff when leaving the kitchen makes a sharp right which there is a blind spot . There is a wall/ divider that is about 4 1/2 ft tall. So anything below that they do not see. This is a problem since it is located right next to the restroom.
June P.,"Palo Alto, CA",3,7,,4.0,1/7/2008,"A go-to for large groups. The menu has a range of food, from salads, to mexican, to chinese, to classic American. Although the ethnic food doesn't quite taste authentic, pretty tasty nevertheless! The prices are pretty high, even during lunchtime. They have a sign that indicates special prices at some random time during the day, such as 3-5 pm or so, but I'll make a better note of that next time I go. The portions are very large though-- almost always enough for lunch the next day."
Jill W.,"Palo Alto, CA",9,50,,4.0,8/22/2009,Just 3 stars?  Really?!  I am normally not a fan of chains but the Cheesecake factory is awesome.  Food is yummy and reasonably priced.
Nate W.,"San Francisco, CA",14,42,,1.0,5/8/2008,"This place should be wiped off the map.  Cheesecake factory and its counterparts: P.F Changs, Benihana, etc. have no place in a region as culinarily rich as the bay area.  I can see going here if you live in the middle of no where, but supporting these glorified Olive Garden/Red Lobster type places is shameful.  If your not wiling to pay a few dollars extra to have a quality meal made by a qualified chef then eat at home.  Maybe prices are high in Palo Alto, but  there are cheaper and better (than cheesecake factory) choices in neighboring cities.  The cheesecake factory makes downtown Palo Alto look like a mall in Scottsdale.  I pick on this location because it is so poorly placed (at least PF Changs had the decency to be at a mall) and the fact that the staff was extremely rude to me when I went in to use the bathroom.-  I'd never eat here, and not because I'm a snob,  I tried it once in Arizona when I was young and dumb and learned that the bigger the menu, the worse the food.  When it comes to university ave. you could throw a dart and hit a better place in any direction.  The problem is quality restaurants have a hard enough time staying open without places like cheesecake factory taking away their business.  The more popular that cheesecake factory gets the more the quality will diminish (even further)."
Martin G.,"South San Francisco, CA",307,198,17,1.0,1/7/2009,"The food is good, dont get me wrong but the services was terrible we went on new years eve with my wife and son the place was empty(we got tthere at 4 so we were just a head of the dinner rush. they sat us in a booth which was ggod for the booster chair. 15 mins went by before a waiter cwame to us, he took our order and we did not see him the rest of the time another peron brought our food to us. I asked if I could have some blue cheese and the waiter says to me""what do you think I gave you?"" I tell him I have ranch but if I could have some blue cheese as well he rolls his eye and says to me thats what you got why dont you try it. I called over the manger and told him I had ranch and would like bluecheese as well. By this time the place is starting to get full all the tables are getting full the waiter(the firsat one) comes back and puts the check on the table. wtf we had just gotton our food I made sure we took our time and left. The cheesecake in san jose is a millon times better"
