Daniel W.,"Mountain View, CA",5,18,4,1.0,9/27/2008,"Today was dismal. I used to be a seasoned patron of cheesecake factory. Their food across their many chains have been consistent and the service was never horrible. Today everything seemed to have changed, we were constantly ignored by waiters no matter how loud we screamed ""excuse me"" or how hard we waived our arms in the air. the appetizers were cold and the salad we ordered didn't even have dressing!!!! quite a few other patrons today seemed to be unhappy as well, I saw a guy at the other table keep shaking his head. Clearly this place does not belong in downtown Palo Alto."
Kylie L.,"Los Angeles, CA",305,385,39,3.0,3/22/2007,"On a busy night this place is crazy.  You wait forever for a table and then you wait forever again for your food and drink...  On a non busy night you will probably get seated right away but unless you have a ""good"" waiter you will wait and wait and wait for your food and drink.  My burger was just fine but my martini was weak.  It is a place that has HUGE portions and A LOT of different items on the menu so if you have alot of people that all want different things... fantastic... hit it up... just don't go when super hungry.  They are not picky about seating two people at a LARGE table which is nice and even though the service is not super great the people usually are at least respectful (if you don't count the waiting)...  So, why do I keep going back here.. well I personally really enjoy the Oreo cookie cheesecake (not the one that is chocolate the one that is plain with Oreo cookies in it).  Never be afraid to split a meal here and be ready to talk loudly because you will not be able to hear nor will you be heard if you speak in a normal voice. So, there you have it"
Girlie G.,"Livermore, CA",11,88,18,1.0,12/3/2006,"I wish I could give this place a zero or negative stars.. because if I could, I certainly would.  So, count my 1 star as really a negative star.  Now why you may ask?  Well, I have been to this same location before and have usually enjoyed the overpriced fare at the Cheesecake Factory because.. I don't know why.. I guess I loved their Flying Gurrila so much that I overlooked the other stuff..  So here we went yesterday.. around 4:30PM for a quick Mojito and some appetizers..  Figured, it would be a nice pre-dinner stop while shopping along the University avenue in Palo Alto and since it's not really dinner or lunch time, it's not as busy.  Of course, it wasn't as busy.. it took us less than 5 minutes to be seated so we were happy that great.. we can have our quick drink and snacks and we can be back shopping.  Well, after we were seated, it took about 20 minutes for the waiter to come by to even ask us for our order.  We were patient and said no problem, they are a bit busy or short staffed..  So we gave our quick order for one Mojito and Bruchetta..  Real simple things, remember and we also asked for some water.  15 minutes go by, and no water.. then 20 and finally arrives the water.. so, now we have been here for 40 minutes before we even got a sip of water.. So much for the quick drink..  We're still waiting for our Mojito.... another 10 minutes go by.. the table next to us, who were seated about 10 minutes after us, already got their drinks that they had ordered but we were still waiting..  We thought, well hmm maybe their Mojitos really come from Cuba and they are waiting for Castro to get better before they can serve it or something.. another 15 minutes go by and nothing..  The waitress did stop by when she brought the drinks for the other table saying, ""oh yours will be right up""..  Of course, it was't..  Anyway, so at that point, after 1.5 hrs since the time we were seated, and still no drink or appetizer on our table, we decided to walk out.  I would NEVER go back to Cheesecake Factory ever again... Hell their Flying Gurrila is not THAT good!!!!!   Thank God I didn't do my birthday party there as I was contemplating earlier in the week.  I consider it blessing in disguise.  So, for those of you who want to wait 1.5 hrs for a drink, 30 minutes before even the waiter shows up at your table, and an hour to get a glass of water, by all means and knock socks off and wallets at this joint.. but for those of you who believe in having good service as being part of an important dining or drinks experience, skip this place..  We ended up going to Pasta Trattoria across the street and had a wonderful Blue Mojito and Caprese Salad.."
Erin M.,"San Carlos, CA",69,7,,4.0,4/25/2008,always one of my favorite places to eat. Great variety and food and awesome atmosphere
Eric L.,"Long Island City, NY",76,13,,2.0,4/11/2009,"The first time is always the best.  Afterwards, the food is just bland.  They give you a lot; I would say most people never finish their food.  They also have a huge menu, which probably contributes to the food being meh.  Still really popular because of the brand name, the decent cheesecake, and the huge location."
Esther A.,"Sunnyvale West, Sunnyvale, CA",80,190,184,1.0,10/22/2007,"so, back when the cheesecake opened, i was so excited... since then, EVERY experience has gotten progressively worse.  tonight was no exception. i love their salads, i'm not picky, i like all of them. so when he picked up the food, came back and opened the salad, even he noticed that it wasn't my normal santa fe salad. i looked at it and saw it was the luau... *shrug* i didn't mind.... i've never ordered the luau as take out, so as he spreads out the food, i keep waiting for the won tons, the dressing.... there was nothing but the veggies and some slices of chicken. no mangoes, no macademia nuts... no silverware, no bread... NO BREAD?!?!?! this is what happens when you have the boy get the food. UGH. not his fault... he ordered his kobe burger medium rare, but it looked RARE... he assured me it was warm, but still looked like the blood was just ready to ooze out. so if their food, the service (in & out of the restaurant) SUCKS... why do i keep going back? the cheesecake is still yummy, but then again, they don't make it at their location... PLUS, their pumpkin cheesecake is BACK! :) eh, next time i'll just get food from pluto's and get a cheesecake from the factory...."
Mel L.,"Palo Alto, CA",2,39,,4.0,5/13/2011,"I've told my children that I love the ""cold beverages"" at The Cheesecake Factory.  They're a perfect enjoyment for any late weekend night or lazy Sunday afternoon.  Translation: Adults and I love their cocktails, e.g. a Raspberry, Ritz, or Extra Dirty Martini.  While the children have ordered selections from the many choices on the kids menu, they have also ordered small dishes from their main menu, e.g. appetizers, soup, salad.  Good food and good service tends to keep most people of any age happy.  And with several types of food to choose from for family/friends who can never agree on one type (hint:  me, us, the kids, the family), this restaurant hasn't let us down.  It offers Asian, Italian, American, Mexican dishes...so we go there regularly.  But what about their cheesecake, are you wondering?  Well, it's funny that we should find ourselves liking a restaurant that makes so many kinds of cheesecakes when....umm...we don't really like cheesecake.  Again, two thumbs up for their regular food menu items though, with a big cheesy grin to go along with my rating."
Jennifer M.,"Menlo Park, CA",0,31,,2.0,7/8/2008,"If you can, avoid the Cheese Cake Factory in Palo Alto!!!  Been here tons of times on my own and for work and the Service is always TERRIBLE!  Not sure why I keep coming back!  It always takes forever to get your food and lots of mistakes are made with orders when you go in large groups.  Lots of average fattening food, but no particular ones that stand out to me.  Portions are huge, so it makes sense to share or take the rest home.  I really enjoy the Cheese Cake Factory in SF (Union Square-Above Macys).  Sit outside, nice view of Union Square!!!  So, it gets 2 stars just for the view.  That's it from here..."
Kristin B.,"North Wales, PA",7,23,,5.0,8/29/2007,"Ive never had a bad meal at the Cheesecake Factory anywhere- I mostly stick to whats best, but its all about the food, I could care less about the service as long as my meal is right.  Best appetizer that I order as an entree are the Fried Macoroni & Cheese Balls.  I hesitated when a friend of mine recommended I try them, but Im so happy I did; Ive been ordering them ever since.  The Garlic Noodles are great, so is the Ranch Bar-B-Q Chicken Salad- and I dont even like ranch or bbq, and I order it without chicken.  The mashed potatoes with onion strings are a nice combination the smooth and crunch; the Portebello Mushroom Sandwich is also amazing.  And finally the best dessert is the Vanilla Bean Cheesecake, not too sweet, but very smooth, its much better than the Original.  Ive tried a lot of different cheesecakes here, but I find most of them are nice, but soo sweet I cant take two bites without needing a glass of water/milk.  Go to the Cheesecake Factory and try the Fried Macoroni & Cheese Balls and Vanilla Bean Cheesecake- its heaven on a plate."
Scott T.,"San Jose, CA",6,60,,3.0,12/2/2008,"There's no 2.5; so they get a 3.  This place is okay for the most part.  Food is alright - nothing to write home about, and some dishes could have been better.  Price is okay, if a bit on the expensive side for what you get.  Ambiance is good - bit noisy, but the interior is something to see.  Service is just plain not very good.  We had to ask for things more than once, and at one point, even that didn't get us what we wanted.  I only come here because of a gift card.  Otherwise, money is more smartly spent somewhere else."
wes c.,"San Bruno, CA",1,17,,4.0,11/2/2007,"what can i say about this place. I've been here about 7 times 5 times with a group of people 7 or more, and the other times with 3 people i do have to agree on one thing with Robyn c is the waitresses and waiters suck the big shrimp, other then that  this place is better then most people think you just have to go at the right times, ( remember that this place serves lunch and dinner any time so that's the key this place) if you go during lunch order a dinner plate and visa versa, any ways the jambalaya is good its not with rice its with noodles so that's the only downer but the Jamaican black peppered shrimp with extra spiciness is to die for i might say. their pastas are average  and same with their steak too. but what really takes this place over the top to the 4 star is their cheesecakes and the terimasue cake not the cheese cake one, and i ha vent even been over the appetizers yet and there average too but the avocado egg rolls are the best and the sweet corn cakes those are the one's I recommend  to try  overall this place is good to eat at just try it."
Brandon S.,"Palo Alto, CA",19,5,,5.0,12/6/2007,"If you're visiting me in East Palo Alto, I'm taking you here-- without a doubt.  Everything in here is off the hook.  Breakfast, lunch, dinner, brunch are all good times to eat there.  Awesome menu -- I try something different every time I go.  Portions match the prices.  Great place to take a family member, close friend, or date."
Barn M.,"San Francisco, CA",1,274,,3.0,5/11/2008,"We thought the cheesecake factory was exquisite.  The fish and chips were great, but we were disappointed that the popcorn shrimp were gone.  The service was good."
Mason S.,"San Jose, CA",0,1,,5.0,9/20/2010,"I took my sweetie here last sunday. It was a little busy  but was a lot shorter wait than the Santa Clara one, where we usually go.We got a couple of menus  before sitting, which was a good thing, since it is a novel. The host was really nice he talked to us on the way back to our table about the giants, which my wife appreciated.We got a nice booth in the back room. it was a little dark, which was my only complaint. Our waitress was amazing! She was spunky, and very knowledgeable. She made suggestions on the new appetizers and entrees, (mushroom burger=heaven). Wife got the  Chicken Madera.She got our drinks and food fast and made sure to keep us comfortable the whole time. She was hysterical, making jokes and helping my poor wife out with which of the 50 chicken dishes to pick from. It made this chain that can sometimes treat you like cattle wanting you to come in and leave quickly, like a mickey d's, 100 times better.She was brand new, couldnt believe it, a total gem. ill come back just for her and the godiva cheesecake! Sat at the bar after to watch the game after then walked around beautiful downtown area. a great night out!"
Christine N.,"San Diego, CA",38,100,2,2.0,9/9/2007,i hate the cheese cake factory. The only people who go there are people who dont know what good food is. I feel bad for them... the only time i go is when there is a work function or a birthday... i hate waiting there and i hate the food.
mary C.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,18,1,4.0,8/23/2007,"I went to the Cheesecake Factory for the first time recently.  I've been there a couple of times in the past, but the wait was always huge and so I've never actually eaten there.  I read some of the reviews about the crappy service.  Maybe because we had a party of 6, it went better for us. We had a reservation for 5:30, but  when I arrived, I discovered that the rest of my party was still on the way.  I informed the 2 people behind the desk.  One guy kind of went 'um...' like it would be a problem, but the other immediately interrupted with 'no problem at all! We'll seat you when they come.'  Well I waited a good half hour before they did and when I finally saw them show up I went to the front to let them know.  The guy kind of looked at me like 'why are you telling me?'  but said okay.  It was 10 minutes before we were seated (after a bunch of walk ins).  Once seated our waiter was quick to come.  We received our drinks and bread, then ordered our appetizers.  The appetizers took FOREVER to come.  I had actually forgotten that we'd ordered them.  Then only once came.  Another 10 minutes later and the manager came to apologize saying that the other had disappeared off the counter and they would bring out a fresh one soon.  The waiter took forever coming to get our orders.  I watched as he seated a party of 8-10 and took their orders first.  Then he did take our order.  Due to the huge portions, I just ordered a side of Macaroni and a side of mashed potatos.  To which I received some teasing from our waiter (not that I'm complaining.  Gives some excitement to our dinner).  It was around 1 hour and 20 minutes from seating to receiving our meal, so the service is VERY slow.  Our waiter did offer to box up our food for us.  He spilled my sister's though, so that was turned complimentary.  He also looked at my hardly touched food and after he stated that he just didn't understand, he offered to let me box it to keep it safe.  I'll admit he was funny and we did a lot of joking even if it took ages to get our food.  Plus, I enjoyed my greasy macaroni - which I am now craving as I write this review."
Justino M.,"Palo Alto, CA",0,12,,4.0,6/8/2007,"Can't decide what you'd like to eat?  The menu has more choices and more categories of food than any other restaurant.  And, we've enjoyed every visit.  We eat at a wide range of restaurants on a regular basis (we both travel for work and pleasure) and this one is very consistent in the quality of food, the excellent service and the real desire to please their guests.  Yes, ask for something and they'll say ""no problem.""  Want something modified, changed or need to ask about a dish and the servers will know what each dish is made up with.   We try to stay away when it's ultra busy - so try to time our visits early in the evening.   It's also a bit quieter then as well.   Lunch is great - and typically we split meals (or, as another reviewer suggested, bring the left overs home for your next meal)."
