LC C.,"San Jose, CA",0,13,6,4.0,1/4/2018,"Took my brother here for lunch on his birthday. Surprisingly easy to get a table around 1 pm on a Friday.  Servers were really nice, especially when they signaled that we were ordering too much food. While the company might not like that, but ethical staff helps to prevent food waste. The servers also validated our good choices. I appreciated them with a nice tip in return.  Food tastes consistently good compared to other branches. Old Town Pasadena makes parking more challenging. Hope this does not affect business like Cheesecake too much."
Eddie M.,"Long Beach, CA",50,5,16,1.0,1/7/2018,"This is the worst service and experience I have ever encountered at any restaurant. Service was extremely slow, we waited 45 minutes to receive our first meal with a party of four.  To make matters worst one entree was wrong and it took the kitchen forenever to bring the dish. That's right I said forenever because it never came.  Out of respect for my two daughters I didn't get raise my voice nor lose my cool even though I was beyond pissed about the whole dinner experience.  The manager did remove the missing entree from our bill and gave me a 25% discount but ruined my daughters celebration dinner.  Epic fail Cheesecake Factory!"
Abigail N.,"Los Angeles, CA",19,23,1,1.0,1/7/2018,"I used to LOVE the Cheesecake Factory. So as a treat I decided to order in using Postmates. Sadly two of the four things i ordered ""weren't available"" and the only vegetable I was left with, the grilled asparagus, was the WORST vegetable dish i've ever had. They were rubbery and had absolutely NO FLAVOR! Didn't even looked grilled. More like steamed. Definitely not worth the $ price tag. Sad to say but i think the Cheesecake Factory has seen it's day, and it's long gone!"
Gina N.,"Diamond Bar, CA",0,17,15,5.0,1/9/2018,Great service! Great food at this location ...  Always a pleasure dining at any Cheesecake Factory!
Donaven S.,"Los Angeles, CA",7,63,61,2.0,1/10/2018,"Came here with my aunt.  long wait, uninspiring service, difficult parking, sub par service.  not comming back. no thanks."
Li Shan W.,"Los Angeles, CA",605,23,28,2.0,1/3/2018,"I was really unhappy with the service here. I came here as a part of a party of 2 on a Saturday night at around 5:20pm. We were seated within 15 minutes but then spent 30 minutes just sitting at the table trying to flag a waiter down. 30 MINUTES of sitting there, we weren't even served any water or bread. I must've talked to two different workers there but they would just brush me off and tell me that they would find someone. Several of the tables that were seated after us were served first and it was incredibly frustrating. When our food finally did come, it was good (maybe because I had waited at least 45 minutes longer than expected and at that point was ravenous and anything would've tasted good). We ordered the Da Vinci pasta and a spaghetti bolognaise.  I wish I could give this Cheesecake Factory a higher score but the service was absolutely appalling."
Julie U.,"Alhambra, Los Angeles, CA",4,24,15,1.0,11/13/2017,"I took take out last night for two pastas and the total with tip came out to about $43  We ordered the carbonara with chicken and the chicken bellagio.  1 STAR for the QUALITY. My friend and I tasted our respective pastas and found that they were EXTREMELY BLAND. We had to try and add salt and pepper to salvage the taste. We were incredibly disappointed because Cheesecake Factory is a well-known ""higher class"" chain. We found that we could have made the pasta better tasting and for a far cheaper price. The whole meal tasted bland of cheap quality and I feel completely ripped off. The pasta is way too oiled and the chicken tastes as though it's from McDonald's or a restaurant a bit of higher quality.  THE WAIT: it took about 35 minutes for us to receive our food upon our request of asking for it. I had previously asked for bread and butter but the workers didn't include the butter nor any napkins.  The problem isn't as much the price as the quality. I go to republique in Downtown LA where the pastas are $40 each and my boyfriend and I each order one for ourselves but the quality makes up for the high price.  Overall, we don't plan on returning for over-priced, bland food that isn't worth the price.  Here is a photo of my food halfway after I ate it. Overly greasy, oiled, and plan - very unappetizing for its price."
Jazmyne A.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,47,67,1.0,1/7/2018,STUPID FKN PLACE. I literally had a party of 18 people and they refused to do a reservation for me. LOL i guess they dont want my money. NEVER going here again.
LeRoy W.,"Corona, CA",3,27,28,3.0,12/27/2017,"Stopped in for lunch. Wednesday afternoon. Not too busy... food was good, as it should be for the price.  Had the breakfast burrito. Good balanced flavors. Not 'hot' at all. We also had the Brioche Breakfast sandwich. Good.  Service was sub-par, but it cold have just been our server. We don't usually come down this way, but if I come back I'll ask for a window table... that area gets better attention. Parking is close walk on Fair Oaks & first 90 min is free... plan on paying if you have to wait for your waitress though. ;-)"
Cynthia H.,"San Diego, CA",78,106,58,4.0,10/29/2017,"I personally feel like food-wise you know what you are getting yourself into. I feel that way with a lot of chain restaurants. Few things really differentiate one branch from another. This was my second time at this location. My boyfriend and I go to the nearest Cheesecake Factory every year for our anniversary (this is our 6th time total).  Service was not unforgettable, I have a pretty good threshold for it as I feel like I am not always in need of something. Our wait on a Friday night was only 15 minutes or so and the food was cooked awesomely. Farfalle bow tie pasta and the lemon piccata with angel hair is a must. Both delicious and creamy pastas that I can't forget. We also got the banana cheesecake (our second time having it, it's a fresh fave) and also the lemon raspberry which was even better than I expected.  I knew what to expect going in especially since this was our 6th cheesecake factory visit, and nothing turned me off."
Elle02__ M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,17,33,2.0,10/27/2017,"So the one in Glendale is by far the worst one!! Don't ever go there. Even if you're in the area.  As far as the restaurant goes, I would recommend to stray from ordering any kind of steaks. My boyfriend ordered a steak once and it was dry, I have to a long time ago, and it was also dry and overlooked. But they're not a Steakhouse. So didn't expect much... I've had the miso salmon which I think is good. I also like the shrimp scampi but if you're not a garlic person, I'd avoid it.  The chicken costoletta,The flatbread pizza, are good... I've had other dishes but can't remember the names, so I'll leave it at that.  Overall, I think food is alright. Nothing too good but not too bad. The best part about the Cheesecake Factory is indeed the Cheesecake. Try the banana cream one, it's the best one!!!  The staff are very attentive, there is little to no wait. You are seated quickly. Food is brought out hot not cold."
Kevin W.,"Temple City, CA",499,1787,7849,3.0,6/27/2017,"The original Cheesecake Factory in SGV. This location has been here for years. It used to be the most popular restaurant in Old Town. Always packed during rush hours, lunch and dinner.  Looks small from the outside but it is pretty big inside. Park at the School House lot, first 90 minutes free! Menu is so overwhelming. They have so much to choose from.  Chinese Chicken Salad - $14.95 - My usual go to dish here. I like the combination of the salad toppings they use. The chicken are nothing special but when you combine it with the toppings and plum dressing, its so good! The plum dressing makes this salad amazing! Grilled Chicken and Avocado Club - $14.50 - Chicken was juicy and tender. You get a ton of avocado. The bacon, tomato, and cheese all were great in the sandwich. Only negative was that the bread was super oily."
Mary H.,"Altadena, CA",452,160,457,3.0,5/11/2017,"Came here the other evening with my parents. It was only a 10 minute wait for the 3 of us around 6:30 pm.  I've been to the Cheesecake Factory many times. I typically order the four cheese pasta or the falafel salad from the superfoods menu. This time I ordered a couple things off of the ""skinnylicious"" menu. They were out of the grilled artichoke that I wanted.  I got the endive salad and the ahi tartare. Both were pretty good. They were off of the small plates menu but they were very small. And for $7-8 each I thought they were a bit on the expensive side for what they were. But they did taste pretty good.  The service was quite slow. It took longer than normal for our food to come out and they also forgot things when they brought out our food. My mom's tacos were missing the crema that comes on the side. I ordered my dressing on the side and they had to bring that separate as well. It just felt a little disorganized.  Next time I'll probably get the falafel salad and save some for later since it's so huge. The only downside is that if you want to add meat to your salad/food, it can be really expensive for the quality of food."
Kokoa T.,"Pasadena, CA",118,49,83,4.0,9/21/2017,"I can't believe this is my first Cheesecake Factory review. I love this place. I used to get their shrimp and bacon club sandwich but sadly, they removed it from the menu. HUGE MISTAKE! I boycotted for a year before their Chicken Picatta pulled me in. Then their appetizer crab cake balls (forgot the name) quickly became a routine favorite. While on disability some months back, I tried their Philly Cheesesteak and again, delish! It's like this place can do no wrong food wise.  Recently I took another visit and got their CA Cheesesteak. I had to make some changes because I'm picky and oooo weeee, again, delish! Not a fan of cheese sauce so I substituted for garlic mayo. Because I love cheese, I asked for extra cheese. The sandwich was delivered to the table looking ooey and gooey and I was too happy! A side of bleu cheese dressing for my french fries and I was SET for dinner!  Our waiter, I think his name was Ray, at least that's what my friend kept calling him lol, was fantastic!! He showed much patience with our indecisiveness and substitutions, then he showed his sense of humor as well. He was great. We couldn't wait to give him a 20% tip. We normally give 20% anyway but Ray, he deserved way more. Budgets, however, were at play lol.  Other than parking not being so friendly since I'm not an Old Town Pasadena fan, I love this place. So far, they have done me no wrong except removing the shrimp and bacon club sandwich. That was just pure evilness. I still have an affinity for The Cheesecake Factory and it's not because of their cheesecakes."
Cyn P.,"New Orleans, LA",44,87,29,4.0,12/1/2017,So I didn't eat here on this visit. We were in the mood for drinks. The mojitos were on point! Refreshing and super yummy. The bartender was busy but got our order out fast. Never got her name. Only reason they didn't get 5 Stars was the sangria. It was mainly ice and not to tasty. That said the margarita my friend had was crazy good.
Vincent Artemio E.,"Monterey Park, CA",66,126,624,5.0,9/27/2017,"If there are so many eclectic and diverse dining choices in Pasadena, why should you visit The Cheesecake Factory in Pasadena? (1)-They have a ""Skinnylicious"" menu that is very diverse; low on calories but big on taste. (2)-The location is smack in the middle of Old Town Pasadena and seating by the sidewalk is ideal to see all the nightlife in action, (3)-the menu choices range from traditional American to Asian/Mexican/Italian. (4)-the appetizers are big enough to be a meal if you order a couple at one time, (4)-it's a great place for friends and family, (5)-DESSERTS! Guaranteed to satisfy your taste buds. Parking is available across the street for a fee. No validation . You can walk off those calories by taking a walk along Colorado Blvd. Recommended for evening dining so you can enjoy the nightlife."
Karen T.,"Temple City, CA",203,60,142,3.0,11/22/2017,Food is good but service is meh. The food here is as expected-- I had yummy italian pasta and it was pretty filling. But the service is terrible. I stopped by on Sunday evening for my godmother's birthday dinner and it had a 30 minute wait time because they don't do reservations. It took forever for the waiter to come by to take our order and our food didn't come out all at once. My skinny shrimp angel hair pasta came out last ... 10 minutes after everyone else's order.  I wouldn't come here again on my own.
Daniel F.,"Long Beach, CA",9,28,41,5.0,11/27/2017,"I ordered the fish and chips plate. The fish was nice and soft, and the fries were crispy. The coleslaw tasted like I was biting into an onion, but it wasn't horrible. Our server made lighthearted conversation. Thumbs up! Our orders arrived on time. My delicious passion fruit iced tea was refilled promptly. This location is in downtown, so be prepared to pay for parking."
Ernest M.,"Los Angeles, CA",624,284,672,4.0,2/5/2017,We are a party of 7. Its a slow night on a Tuesday in Old town Pasadena. We were seated right away as soon as our party showed up. Did a alright job heping us. Nothing that really stood out. I was in good company. I had the veggie sandwhich. Plenty of fries. Its a bit on the greasy side but I still remembering the food being decent.  notes: street parking parking garages. verdict: I guess you can come out here. haha.
Kat M.,"Redondo Beach, CA",673,731,348,5.0,1/14/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory consistently gets mediocre reviews despite the DELICIOUS cheesecake and entrees.  I happen to LOVE this chain restaurant and am not not embarrassed to admit it.  After a morning of sledding and playing in snow, we were ready for a hearty lunch.  We ordered our cheesecakes FIRST!  I ordered my usual Reese's Cheesecake with the chocolate cake and caramel layers.  My hubby ordered Salted Caramel.  Bother were DIVINE =).  My hubby preferred his.  I might conquer, but every time I stray from my usual I feel unsatisfied. I then ordered the Santa Fe Salad chopped.  It was SUPERB and filled with ingredients.  Some locations are skimpy on the ingredients, but not this one.  I could only eat 1/3 of my salad.   My family LOVES splurging here.  I would definitely eat here again.  Service was attentive and friendly as usual.  Expect a wait at this location on the weekends."
Alin A.,"Santa Clarita, CA",74,85,133,5.0,6/27/2017,Great customer service  We went with friends after 10 pm to have Cheese cake and we had so much fun.  Great  customer service . And yummy cheese cake .
L F.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,87,329,4.0,11/18/2017,"Street parking is a challenge in Pasadena so you may want to just park at a structure. The wait to get a table was not bad but I was there in a Thursday night. Our server was very attentive and service was very good. That warm bread they bring is delicious. I had the Miso salmon as my main dish and Fried cauliflower and Ahi tartare for appetizers. Everything was delicious... except the sangria, I was a little disappointed."
Bindi P.,"Los Angeles, CA",176,218,463,4.0,2/6/2017,"I've been to this location many times over the years.  Most recently I popped in with a friend to catch the halftime show. I love cheesecake factory.  I always have a good time here.   We ended up sitting at the bar. The TVs are low in volume so we couldn't hear much, but it's also not a sports bar either.  The bartender was great and attentive.  Ended up ordering the hot spinach dip and avocado egg rolls which are my favorites! Food came out fast and was super delicious.  I usually don't sit at the bar at cheesecake, but it was nice this time.  Ended up having some great conversations with the people sitting by us."
Kaydence C.,"Encino, Los Angeles, CA",0,4,,3.0,12/27/2017,I've been to many cheesecake factories and this one was just ok. Pretty good food and decent service. Parking is so bad though.
Brian S.,"Las Vegas, NV",13,251,80,3.0,5/21/2017,"It is Cheesecake Factory, you know what to expect.   - huge overwhelming menu - high calorie foods done consistently decent - nothing is stellar but nothing is bad - the place is insanely loud and crowded - the portion sizes are massive - getting the attention of a server is a challenge - the cheesecake is outrageously good in taste and breath  - the food is a bit over priced but you knew that before your walked in the door Either you like this place or you don't.  Personally, I don't but the better half and the kid do.   Some days democracy is a PITA."
Becky F.,"Fort Collins, CO",8,65,4,2.0,10/10/2017,"This is the most ""meh"" Cheesecake Factory I've been to. My BBQ burger was missing the fried onions, sweet potato fries were cold and the pineapple Moscow mule is way too sweet. What topped off my bad experience was the fact that the bathroom was a mess- I leaned up against the sink while washing my hands and the sink was soaking wet. I spent the rest of the night with dirty sink water on my shirt and my jeans.. yuck!"
Linda L.,"Rosemead, CA",0,82,67,3.0,10/31/2017,Came for HH in Halloween.  Lucky it was not crowded and was able to have a table in the bar area.  Great services today and the spinach dip is always good here.  Ran out of chips so improvised with sourdough...not bad! The HH slider order came with 4 sliders.  $1.50 add'l for fries.  HH cocktail is good as well.
Amanda J.,"Diamond Bar, CA",499,167,694,5.0,10/13/2016,All of the Cheesecake Factory restaurants are consistently good in many ways. My family and I enjoy trying different locations. It is a restaurant that we all (5 of us) have a definite  favorite food. We had a great experience at this location.  Convenient to park in the lot across the street.  Nice spacious booths  Comfortable decor.  We were able to feel a part of the restaurant but also feel like we were at a private party.  Our waitress was wonderful. She made the experience even better. Her recommendations made some new favorite dishes for us. She knew when to check on us and when to leave us to our discussions.  This is my favorite location right now and I can't wait to go back.
Lana L.,"East Rutherford, NJ",0,16,3,1.0,12/16/2017,"Literally the slowest Cheesecake Factory ever. The service was so slow and our waitress was not attentative AT ALL. The hiring managers need to wake up. They should also consider selling half slices. They would do much more business! *UPDATE* Ordered postmates on a Saturday night because i was babysitting. Specifically asked for no peas and no mushrooms. Also ordered a cheesecake. My order arrives WITH MUSHROOMS AND PEAS and super salty and dry.  So at this point i am LIVID because I can't eat the food and now i have to drive to Cheesecake Factory and look for parking and pay for parking. I explained to the manager what happened - she apologizes and offers to remake it. I tell her i prefer a refund. She then asks me ""but the cheesecake was okay right?"" And refunds me just for the pasta. I should have been refunded for my ENTIRE meal being that they hugely inconvenienced me and I had to pay a delivery fee through postmates AND TIP the delivery person. All for me to get in my car WITH A BABY and drive there. They clearly don't care about customer satisfaction and just want money. Will never be back."
Jennevy A.,"San Diego, CA",7,56,14,2.0,4/2/2017,"I've been to The Cheesecake Factory pretty much everywhere in California and I have to say that I was surprised of how dirty this one was. The table and silverware were pretty dirty and the service wasn't as prompt and efficient as it is at other Cheesecake Factories. Also, the food was burnt and lacked flavor. The complimentary brown bread wasn't as tasteful as it usually is. Nor was the shrimp jambalaya entree I always order; it tasted as if it could use some work."
Susan A.,"Easton, PA",5,172,28,5.0,10/14/2017,"We generally enjoy the Cheesecake Factory-the wide selection of menu items means that everyone can usually find something. We had good service here but the sweet potato fries were not up to the usual standard-they were not super warm and some tasted undercooked. Our waiter wasn't around after the food was ordered (he seemed to get a lot of tables all at once) and we didn't feel like going to the hassle of sending them back. This was not a bad experience , just not the best we've had at a restaurant we've grown to love in part because of their consistency.   Update: wow-brunch menu is amazing. The brûléed french toast is a must!!! Crispy on the outside and tasty on the inside with a buttery syrup. The avacado toast is lovely-the little pickled onions really make it. The heuvos rancheros are delish too. All in all very tasty and filling"
Dawla A.,"Pasadena, CA",15,120,7,5.0,9/19/2017,"I was born and raised in NYC and I've had all kinds of shrimp scampi but this cheesecake factory's (Pasadena,CA) has some amazing shrimp scampi. My hubby got the ribeye with mash. OMG the food was amazing. We only waited 20 mins and for a saturday night, I would have to say that is not a bad wait time. The hostess and the waitress were super nice."
Maria G.,"Tujunga, Los Angeles, CA",1,9,,4.0,12/14/2017,"I love getting a slice of cheesecake to go! Always very tasty. This way, you avoid their slow service and endless food choices."
Nicholas C.,"Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA",114,19,1,3.0,10/15/2017,I don't understand how you could be out of bread on a Sunday at 3:45pm?  This is a major chain... It puzzles me...
Yunho S.,"Pasadena, CA",74,1,2,2.0,10/17/2017,"Lmao didn't know carbonara had so much olive oil in it :/ it just tasted greasy and bland, couldn't taste any cream in it"
Kevin L.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,2,,2.0,1/4/2018,"Came in on a Thursday around 2p.m and it was still a pretty decent sized lunch crowd. Good thing was that it was just my friend and I so we didn't have to wait long.. We got seated within 5 minutes and that was when it went downhill from there. I always give restaurants the benefits of the doubt because I too am in the Food / Beverage Hospitality Management field. 10 minutes passed by and I didn't mind because I still haven't made a decision on what I wanted but my friend came in starving. Another 10 minutes passed by and my friend was slowly getting ticked off so she flagged a random server down. I'm not the type of person to do that because it was understandable since it was busy. Our server came by and asked what we would like to drink. Once our drinks were placed, she asked if we wanted Bread and Butter and we politely said yes and told her that we were also ready to order. My friend got a Mushroom Burger and I got the Parmesan Herb Crusted Chicken. 15 minutes passed by and my friend started getting grumpy. She flagged down a random server to check up on our food because our server was no where to be found. 10 minutes later, the person we flagged brought our food out. Boy, were we hungry. My friend asked her for burger medium rare and it came out well done and cold, and my green beans were way undercooked, it was rubbery and it had no flavors, but to be honest, we were too hungry to say anything. The bill came and we still left a 20% tip despite of the downfalls. Not sure if i will come back though because this is my third time to Cheesecake Factory, and all three times, service is just bleh."
Layla T.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",4,77,50,1.0,9/8/2017,"This place is the worst. I called in a phone order, with a guy named Sammy. He told me my food would be ready in 20 minutes. I work nearby so I walked over which took me ten minutes. So my food should have been ready, by half hour time. I arrive and this guy Sammy is scrambling to find my order ticket, turns out HE NEVER PLACED THE ORDER. So he apologizes a bunch of times because he didn't do his job correctly. And on top of that doesn't offer to get a manager to discount our entire meal. Maybe he didn't want to get in trouble with management for this huge mistake that was entirely his fault, so he doesn't offer to have a manager come and fix it. His apology should suffice right? No. It doesn't because I already waited a half hour for my food and then I had to sit in store and wait another 15 minutes to receive the food I was originally coming to simply PICK UP. Then I get back to my office, give my boss her food, which included a soup of the day that when I called was told that it was the 'Mexican Chicken', turns out it was clam chowder, MY BOSS IS ALLERGIC TO CLAMS. We call the manager of the restaurant to discuss all that has happened, he agrees to refund us because my boss starts to have an allergic reaction, but never apologizes for all that has occurred. I go back into the restaurant and the manager just gets me the refund, no trying to apologize for the terrible mistake. Awful service and I can't believe the manager wasn't even apologetic."
Diana B.,"Los Feliz, Los Angeles, CA",77,4,5,4.0,10/8/2017,Had the Hisbaichi steak. I am disappointed for $20.00 was not worth it. Very chewy.  The mashed potatoes were weird. I think it would be better if they chilled out with mashed potatoes and not put a bunch of stuck in them and marinated the steak longer . I dig their pasta though!
Caroline H.,"Quinebaug, CT",33,20,16,4.0,11/26/2017,A great spot to eat.  The menu offers a great selection at affordable prices.  The atmosphere is cozy and the service is pleasant.
Ernst P.,"Montebello, CA",5,20,11,4.0,3/26/2017,Great spin..mushroom omlete. Brea potatoes a little dry but over all atmosphere and service snd price is always great
