Christina Z.,"San Gabriel, CA",0,7,1,3.0,4/24/2017,Well to start there wasn't a wait to get seated however the food took forever to come.  The complementary beard was hard and when I looked at other tables they got three pieces of bread while my table only got 2. Overall I feel like their quality went down and everything seemed smaller.
Adee P.,"New York, NY",38,1,1,1.0,10/23/2016,Had to wait 20 min just to put in an order to go...n there was no one infront of me..but a white lady comes in and they helped her right away n yet im still waiting...Horrible service asked the front girls in the front for help and they just looked at each other all dumb.. Nevermind coming back agin..  Horrible customer service
R T.,"Glendora, CA",4,249,42,5.0,3/28/2016,"Went here after shopping just for a breather and dessert.  There was no wait and the server was peppy and patient as we kept talking instead of looking at the menu. We finally decided on the limoncello cake and apple crumble aka mode.  Both were perfect, delicious and huge! We should have shared!  But we took the leftovers home instead.  Love this place. Will be back."
Ada F.,"Pasadena, CA",659,313,1421,3.0,9/1/2014,"It's been awhile since I have been here. I remember the wheat bread to be warm and delicious. Came here for lunch on Labor Day. Did not have to wait to be seated. Service was really slow. We had to wait awhile before our waitress came to greet us and ask what we would like to drink. After that she disappeared and it took awhile before she took our order. I felt like getting breakfast and was happy to see breakfast items served all day. I ordered the breakfast brioche sandwich which has ham, bacon, eggs, tomatoes with a grilled brioche and potatoes on the side. My glass of water showed up and I noticed how dirty it was. There was so sort of greasy stain or sauce or something on the outside of my glass. That's just gross. Do they not clean their glasses?? The bread basket came and the wheat bread was as good as I remembered it to be. The food came and my potatoes were super crispy to the point I feel they were more burnt than anything. My husband loves the extra extra crispy so he was happy eating them. My brioche sandwich was just okay. The cheese was not all melty, the bacon was not crispy and it was more fat than anything. The ham flavor was just so so. Bummed about the breakfast sandwich. Will not be ordering that item.  Super noisy today and there were a few screaming kids to add to the meal. Our waitress was nice and she did come check on us twice and to fill the water cups. When we were walking out we saw lots of people waiting for a table. This place does get packed."
Natasha L.,"Silver Spring, MD",0,52,,4.0,10/27/2016,"I was at this place again a few days ago. I must say, our server Vanessa the redhead was wonderful! Please give her a raise! She's so friendly and her customer service skills are amazing."
Michael Q.,"San Buenaventura (Ventura), CA",12,46,2,5.0,3/28/2016,Stopped in for a Bloody Mary and decided to stay for a while once we got to know Josh. We had the best time hanging out and sucking down bloody Mary's with Josh and Gustavo. This is going to be our new favor tie hang out. Keep up the good work guys!!
Jun R.,"Valencia, CA",110,160,493,4.0,2/14/2015,"Valentine's Day in LA and its 86 degrees. We got here at 11:30am and there was no wait. We ordered a Strawberry banana smoothie and fire cracker salmon for starters. The sauce really brings out the flavor of the salmon.  For lunch, I had the Jamaican shrimp with mango salad and fried bananas my wife has her favorite jambalaya pasta. For dessert we tried the Oreo dream extreme cheesecake, it's very rich and filling. I got so full, I wanted to take a nap. But, there is more stuff to do in old town Pasadena."
Grace P.,"San Francisco, CA",689,299,603,4.0,10/23/2014,"Theres nice parking on green street (90 minutes free) and Cheesecake factory is just a minutes walk away.  It's a big tight and crowded inside - esp during dinner time - and they dont take reservations, so try to beat the rush when you come here, since it is a very popular location and the wait time can get as long as 1+ hour. But the food is pretty damn good, and the serving sizes are huge. I usually end up only finishing half of the dishes. The service is great, and I never had a problem, and Ive been here frequently. A great place to come as a easy meal out with friends!"
K C.,"East Los Angeles, CA",2,58,34,5.0,2/26/2016,Always a great server and delicious food.. Let's not forget the awesome drinks!!! I always get the strawberry mojito.. Not on the menu but they make it and it's delicious!!! One of my favorite restaurants!! :-)
Felicia G.,"Glendale, Los Angeles, CA",173,609,811,4.0,12/9/2014,"Cheesecake Factory has a little bit of everything. For a chain, they are always very consistent. Ive enjoyed my meals here over the years. My only wish at this location is that it wasn't so crowded."
Jasmine H.,"West Covina, CA",25,16,4,1.0,5/13/2016,Came here yesterday with a couple of friends because they've never had cheesecake factory before. I had the Chicken Alfredo and the red velvet cheesecake. I ended up with food poisoning last night and today. Not a great impression to leave especially if I brought new customers who say they were going to return but after my little incident they will never come back. Neither will I. One star for service which was alright.
Shah K.,"La Crescenta, CA",2,52,,4.0,10/2/2016,I like this location. It's rarely crowded and we usually get seated fairly quickly. The food and service are also up to par !
Frank M.,"Downey, CA",30,58,3,5.0,7/26/2016,Came here on 7/24/16 to celebrate a birthday. It was later in the evening but was still packed. Wait time to be seated was under 10 mins. Our server was Leonor. Her customer service was awesome. Very soft spoken and polite. Although we were stuffed from diner she still brought out a small ice cream and candle. Very nice and thoughtful. The good is always great. It came out in a reasonable time and was still very hot when we began to eat. Overall a great night we'll definitely be back. Oh and the mac and cheese bites are off the charts. Should've got some to go.
Leo C.,"Irvine, CA",1,16,10,3.0,9/6/2016,"We were there on Aug-27 around 1:30-2pm. The wait line was reasonable in that location, so I would rate than 4 stars (but still be waiting for 30 mins). However, the service got knocked down anther star because the person provided pretty poor customer service. We would have to try to find our waiter but he was no where to be found. He did not seem pleased because we did not order any appetizers or drink to begin with (we ordered some drinks for the kids only, and for adults, we like water since we already had some sodas at home before we came).  Anyhow, would I come again this location? Most likely not."
Shirls P.,"Malibu, CA",1,28,39,1.0,8/23/2016,When will they realize they need to hire more staff. This may be one of the worst ones for service. Stop being cheap - hire!
Candance N.,"Burbank, CA",49,35,19,4.0,9/29/2015,"I love cheesecake - so I have to say I love this place! The service was great, food was amazing, their menu was so huge, it was hard to actually pick what I wanted to eat. My tip is to get a to go cheesecake to eat later!"
Lanise J.,"Altadena, CA",23,87,142,4.0,9/6/2015,"One of my favorite spots close to home when you want some close to home cooking. I think Friday and Saturday's  they should stay open later. Well it is what it is , you can never go wrong with the cheese cake factory. Good food and good service."
Nick T.,"Arcadia, CA",0,7,,3.0,9/26/2016,Food was very delicious and tempting as I wanted another plate to take home but was to full to even smell it. The reason I gave them only three stars is the bad customer service and the  speed of service. Over all it was ok  but adjustments should be me made in order to satisfied all aspects of WOW service.I will come back but for today you guys get three.
B R.,"San Juan Capistrano, CA",9,221,187,4.0,7/27/2016,"Cheesecake Factory never disappoints, whether it's Las Vegas, New Jersey, or California, the food is consistently delicious, service is fast, and portions are big. My go to dish here is their Jambalaya with pasta. I always get extra sauce on the sauce.  I can never finish this dish in one seating. I either share it with my hubby or have left over for my next meal. I also love their tex-mex egg rolls and their seared ahi salad, The dressing on the salad is delicious and goes really well with seared ahi.  The cheesecakes are of course delightful, scrumptious...awesome. I love the red velvet, strawberry, godiva chocolate, dutch apple caramel streusel.  Occasionally they offer a white chocolate blueberry truffle which is light and delish. I'm looking forward to my next trip to the Boca Park Summerlin location this Saturday, 7/30/16, to celebrate my dad's birthday and national cheesecake day."
Taylor H.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",630,20,8,5.0,4/11/2016,We had a group of six girls and were seated immediately. Right away we were brought warm bread. Erica was our server and she constantly checked on us and our waters were always full. She smiled and we felt very welcomed. All of us would come again if we are in the area. I would like to add that the fried Mac n cheese balls are amazing!!!
