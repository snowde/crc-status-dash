Meghan S.,"Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, CA",0,16,1,4.0,6/3/2017,"Was pretty disappointed with our experience, although I was pleased with how the manager handled things which is why I gave it such a high star rating (plus the food's taste was great). It took over an hour for our two meals to come out and our server, Ray, was very intimidating. He was unfriendly and unapproachable. He even told us half way through that he was going home for the night, we got a new server, yet Ray was still seen around the restaurant helping other tables for the next 30 minutes...? It was very confusing. After talking to the manager, Lawrence, about how long it took for our food to come out, he apologized profusely and gave us dessert on the house. I appreciated that he said, ""It doesn't matter how busy the restaurant is, you should never be made to feel that way."" We will give this location one more chance."
Christine W.,"Pasadena, CA",221,37,7,3.0,5/27/2017,"Came here for a quick meal after a long day. The food was cold, but only because the restaurant was so freezing! We were both shivering and our food got so cold so quickly. The food was average, I asked for my burger to be medium rare but it came well done which was disappointing. The service was slow  and our experience was average."
Trent N.,"Los Angeles, CA",79,16,7,1.0,6/1/2017,"I love the Cheesecake Factory, and usually have a great experience when dining here. However, last night at this location I was very disappointed. Our food was delayed because according to the manager one of our party's food was not made at his standards to be sent out. Not a problem. However when our food finally came out both pastas that we ordered were hard and dry as if sitting under a heat lamp for an hour. The noodles and shrimp were over cooked and ""chalky"". In an attempt to salvage the pasta we asked for a side of alfredo sauce. This never ended up coming out. After sitting there waiting we ended up just returning the food, paying for our drinks, and leaving. The manager never came back out to check on us, and the only thing the server could say was sorry that the extra alfredo never made it out."
Lanna B.,"San Diego, CA",0,13,2,1.0,8/8/2017,"My boyfriend and I both ordered separate meals. He had pasta, I had the Korean style cauliflower (which was delicious!) and the avocado egg rolls. After eating, while waiting for our check, we BOTH started feeling nauseous. I have thrown up once, haven't eaten since that meal (which was my only meal of the day) I have no appetite, nausea, horrible gas out of both ends, and confirmed food poisoning. Would not recommend even though those cauliflower bites were damn delicious."
Brenda C.,"San Gabriel, CA",4,47,45,1.0,12/10/2016,"Seriously, been here a few times and it seems the service is getting worse. It's unfortunate but we were served way later than a couple that was seated after us. The waittress served and tended to the couple next to us even though we arrived quite some time prior to thr couple. The waitress also forgot our appetizer and blamed th line staff :/ when the food came there was a big rubber band in the omelette. We hardly ever have these experiences but this was a doozy."
Baron B.,"Pasadena, CA",274,5,,3.0,5/4/2017,"This is an awesome location, and the service was almost really good! Our waitress Priscilla took our orders of 4 people, and from the start was messing up our orders. On my turn to order I ordered the jambalaya sub chicken with sausage, but she seemed to be very confused! Like how are you confused! So that was that! We ate our food and the food was excellent, then we got a new waiter named Steven and he was excellent! 10/10 it was at the end of the meal when we got our checks! Well, Priscilla messed up my order and charged me for extra extra sausage and my meal came out way more expensive then it should have! That was just a hassle! Steven handled it really well. Thanks cheese cake"
Faye L.,"San Diego, CA",514,1202,8732,3.0,6/19/2015,"First and Foremost, did you know they have HAPPY HOUR here at the Pasadena location 4p-6p.   I took sis here for her birthday dinner the other weekend. The restaurant was a mirror image of the city that night: busy and chaotic.  Complimentary breads (french and squaw?) are served warm and with pats of butter. We ordered: - AVOCADO EGGROLL  Seriously. This is the best appetizer here. It sounds grossly ick but don't knock it 'til you've tried it. The sweet tamarind sauce is such a winner here. - STEAK DIANE AND SHRIMP SCAMPI Sis said the steak was nice and tender (prepared medium plus). The mashed potatoes were more like smashed potatoes. - SHRIMP SCAMPI AND CHICKEN MADEIRA The chicken madeira is smothered with mozzarella and a beautiful sweet dark madeira wine sauce. The shrimp scampi is pretty yums as well. The breaded large shrimp is pan fried and then covered in this delicious garlic sauce. I wish they'd leave out the breading as it becomes a bit gummy/thick after it sits in the sauce too long. - MANGO KEY LIME CHEESECAKE Nice and tart. I'm not sure if this is a new item. Make sure to ask for extra whip cream.  I had whispered to the waitress before the meal that it was sis' bday. She said they only give out a free sundae (?) or something? It was loud in the restaurant so maybe I misheard. I told her that would be great but I'd like to order a slice of cheesecake (that I would pay for). We didn't get the free sundae but did appreciated the decorated cheesecake plate and the waitresses singing happy birthday to sis.  The Cheesecake Factory is a fun place to have a meal if you don't mind the wait, chaos, and overall busy-ness of this place. Service and food tends to be consistent so that's always a plus. Don't forget about their Happy Hour -"
Jessica M.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,21,2,5.0,11/19/2016,"My boyfriend and I visited this location about a month ago and found seats at the bar. We ordered some cocktails and appetizers because it was late and we weren't in the mood for huge entrees. The bartender (sorry forgot her name) was nice and service was good. We ordered some Tex Mex Eggrolls that ended up taking around 20-30 mins to come out. We were really bummed because we were starting to get full. So we just wanted to take them off the bill and cancel the order, because it looked like they had just forgotten about the order. However, a manager (Loretta) came over and took them off the bill and had given them to us anyways because of our inconvenienced. We thought that was super nice of her and she was great!!!"
Scarlet P.,"Pasadena, CA",0,22,,2.0,5/9/2017,"This is place is too dark for my liking. I went there once with a friend of mine and the waitress is busy talking, with her peers, I have to wait for about 5-10 mins in order to get her attention. The food is extremely overpriced for its mediocre tastes. Waiting time is not very pleasant either. I'm not going back there!"
Evelyn O.,"Azusa, CA",0,2,1,2.0,4/30/2017,"On Sunday my order was taken and the food was good. Once my food was served, no one checked on me to see if I needed anything. Needed to ask for butter and jam since my toast was dry. This was brought to the table. No one ever asked me if I wanted another drink or checked in to see if the food was to my liking. Disappointed in the service. Took way to long to bring the check and then another wait before my credit card was returned. I liked the food but was disappointed in the service."
Sharon E.,"Orange, CA",2,11,1,5.0,3/21/2017,"I live in Orange County and made the somewhat challenging trip to meet several friends at the Pasadena Cheescake Factory.  I have been to many Cheescake Factory over the years.  I want to give a shoutout to the Manager, Ryan. I had a somwhat embarrassing situation when the soul of my shoe became detached from my shoe. There I was with every step flapping like a circus clown. I thought, okay by any chance could the Cheescake Factory have any glue? I asked the waitress who said she doubted it but said she'd ask her Manager and lo and behold Ryan appeared. He knew where I was sitting  and said he'd be back. Within 5 minutes Hero Ryan appeared with Glorilla Glue.  I held my dangeling flap while Cobbler/Manager Ryan glued it to the base of my shoe. Then he disappeared and returned with a rubber band in case the glue didn't hold. Well it did and now I'm wearing the rubber band on my wrist, but will put it in my purse for, you never know instances..   shout out to Ryan for his help and oh so pleasant attitude.  Who knows ladies it could be that your ready to have your baby, you stop at the Cheesecake Factory unaware and all of a sudden your baby wants to arrive, call ""Ryan"" if he produces Gorilla Glue don't put anything past him."
Julia C.,"Alhambra, CA",0,11,58,5.0,8/1/2016,"This is my favorite plate for a salmon. Every time I go to Santa Anita mall for shopping and my mom is with me, we love to go there and order the miso salmon, the crab chowder soup, cesar salad and pineapple mojito. It is a good place to go with your friends, family or partner."
Roderick K.,"La Cañada Flintridge, CA",2,24,11,1.0,6/26/2017,"Sat down as soon we got inside so as you can tell it probably wasn't as busy as usual. Took our order probably 10 minutes into us getting our table. After that is pretty much where the experience of cheesecake suprised me. Took about 40 minutes for us to get our food, only for me to find out my americana styled hamburger wasn't made correctly. So one of us were eating while the only other choice would be to wait another 20-30 minutes for another burger. I told them to double check the order they wrote, the order was correct so this would be the chefs fault. I also didnt like how the waitress didn't really know how to take care of the situation... Honestly expected more from a place like this"
Chandler H.,"San Gabriel, CA",1,27,6,4.0,11/10/2016,"I have to start out this review by saying that I really enjoy CF's food. The portions are great, love the variety of flavors/types of food, great desserts of course. The restaurants always have great locations too, like this one which is in the heart of Old Town Pasadena.  I've been noticing for some time now that the busyness of the place affects the service. Wait times are long and the servers run from table to table. Because of this, I've been calling for pickup to just get the food. Unfortunately, the pick up option convenience is now getting worse.  When I called in the food, they told me 20 mins and it'd be ready. I got there 25 mins later and paid, but my food wasn't ready. There were three ""Door Dash"" guys in front of me waiting for their food. Long story short, I waited for another 25 mins (and after asking the worker twice to look into my order).  Overall, not too impressed with the service. Pickup is negatively affected by these Apps that you can order and pickup with. Maybe I should just embrace it and use Door Dash or something like that."
Mister S.,"Brentwood, CA",0,42,,3.0,7/12/2017,No different from any other cheesecake factory around the nation. Food is adequate. Drinks or refreshing. The staff is the only gamble you will take eating here as he can change from week to week.
Elizabeth G.,"Altadena, CA",8,13,30,5.0,9/24/2016,"Great food, service, friendly staff. Fun atmosphere. Definitely coming back!! Newly painted, very clean and bright with all the surrounding windows, no waiting to be seated. My  crusted salmon and asparagus was delish along with the mashed potatoes and scrimp scampi, will be getting that again. Delish!!!!"
Harry S.,"Sunland-Tujunga, CA",4,47,57,1.0,10/1/2017,Awful. I had to send back my appetizer of grilled artichoke because only goats and chickens could have eaten it. So undercooked as to be embarrassing. My dish of fish tacos was just odd. The tortillas were radically undersized. Your supposed to get a whole evolution of flavor and mouth feel out of a taco impossible since you had to take most of it out with a fork that was badly bent in my case. I have never had a street or truck taco that was such a joke. Attractive as it all was flavor counts too. The rice served with it was apparently drizzled with 40wt motor oil. I know what that smells like having an antique car. It made me ill. I never had this kind of atrocity at any other location. I had a great experience three times in a row at the one in Cucamonga. All of the restaurants out their are superior to anything in Pasadena once a foodie paradise. My kids barley at half of what they were served. They always finish what I make them and they go get more. Shame on this location. Waste of my money and worse my time.
Taleen B.,"La Crescenta-Montrose, CA",155,198,96,5.0,2/16/2016,"This place is mine and my boyfriends favorite place to eat. Their servers are always nice and attentive. We've never had bad service here! Menu--huge selection.. I have trouble deciding what to eat here and it's really annoying. I always have to do the process of elimination cause I have trouble choosing between 5 entrees. Everything just sound soo goooddddd After being here over 50 times....... here are my suggestions: Appetizer: Fried Mac N Cheese-- SOOOOO good omg. Fills you up like crazy, though.. Caesar salad is also amazing. Their dressing is garlic-y so if you hate garlic.... stay away. Nachos, avocado egg rolls, spinach and artichoke dip... delicious. Entree: My recent favorite has been the southwest chicken sandwich.. My favorite sandwich besides the california cheesesteak. The spicy chipotle chicken pasta is also one of my top choices! Dessert: UM.. literally any cheesecake. They're all bomb."
Jeff S.,"South Pasadena, CA",11,4,2,1.0,12/24/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory is a chain that my lady and I frequent often. Always 100% satisfied with the service and the food.  On this night however, that sentiment changed, drastically for the worse.  My wife and I were out for a walk in Old Town after Christmas Eve dinner. My wife is 8 months pregnant, so frequent bathroom breaks are a part of life. We walked over to the Paseo, bathrooms closed. From there, we walked to the small courtyard in between Sephora and Crate & Barrel, also closed. After that distance of a walk and to no avail, it is now a bathroom code red!  We walk back out on to Colorado Blvd. and see The Cheesecake Factory is open. We just knew they'd let us use the bathroom. No questions or doubts about it.  WRONG! (Slightly) The time is now 10:30. We walk in and approach the host's counter were we are greeted by Joanna (I'm pretty sure that was her name). My wife asks to use the bathroom and explains quickly that we haven't been able to find and use another. Joanna allows her to use the bathroom but only after making my wife feel stupid for asking by saying: ""But you know, there are public restrooms behind Sephora."" What!? Thanks for the unnecessary comment. WE ALREADY TRIED THAT!  Honestly, that was RUDE! Better to have said no and saved us the feeling of stupidity.  I was already planning on getting us a slice of cake, but now I felt obligated!  Not cool. I understand it's Christmas Eve, but there's never an excuse for such rude, poor service."
Jason R.,"Pasadena, CA",0,2,1,5.0,7/9/2017,"Went in and the hostess was amazing. Waiter was great, food was awesome. I have no comlapins. I love eating there."
