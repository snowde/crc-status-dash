Cameron C.,"Anaheim, CA",1,2,3,1.0,3/12/2017,"This Cheesecake Factory in Pasadena is terrible. The service is slow, my New York steak burnt, and not attentive. I've been to other cheesecake factories in different locations and had amazing service and food. I don't know why this one is terrible"
Vic C.,"Duarte, CA",107,2372,8712,3.0,2/20/2015,"What has happened to Cheesecake Factory? I have dined at this location here and there when I was in high school (that was 10-15 years ago). But have dined at other Cheesecake Factory locations over the years and am sad to see that the food quality has gone down hill within the last few years. Anyways, on my most recent visit to this location (yesterday afternoon around 2 pm for a late light lunch), my husband and I were seated at a small table near the kitchen. These are the items we ordered: Vietnamese Shrimp Summer Rolls, $10.95 prior to tax- My husband wanted something light since he had a big (late) breakfast and decided upon these spring rolls. I had low expectations for these spring rolls because with an American restaurant making spring rolls, I just had a feeling they wouldn't be good. And well, my suspicions were correct. These 3 rolls (pretty expensive for 3) were poorly wrapped and the wrong type of noodles were used in them. Also these summer rolls are supposed to have shrimp. Only one roll had 1 shrimp and the other 2 had none. I did like the peanut flavored sauce and the sweet chili sauce that came with the rolls though (these are the same sauces that come with the Thai Lettuce Wraps, which my husband should have ordered in the first place because that actually taste good, although it is not a light appetizer). Luau Salad (Lunch portion), $10.95 prior to tax- The lunch portion size (you can order lunch portions until 5 pm) is actually a good size for one person (I shared part of my salad with my husband). The presentation of this salad was pretty. It comes with 2 large fried won ton pieces. It isn't exactly healthy so I didn't finish it.  Whenever I order a salad, I always order for the dressing to be on the side. In this salad, there are pieces of mango, cucumber slices, sliced bell peppers, green beans, macadamia nuts and sesame seeds. The sweetness of the mango was good enough that this salad didn't need the dressing (I had a little of the dressing and it does go well with the salad, just in case you are someone who just has to have dressing on your salad). I love the different textures, flavors and crunch. Strawberry Lemonade, $3.95 prior to tax- This lemonade was pretty bad. The lemonade tasted too sour and tasted as if rotten fruit was made with it. When we got a 2nd glass, it still had the same taste. The reason being was that our server just ladled out the drink from a large container that was already premade (so our 1st glass wouldn't taste any different from the 2nd until someone makes a new batch... but I bet it will still taste the same).  ------------------------------ (Total= $34.95 after tax and tip)  Service was just average and really could have been better attentive (especially it being in the late afternoon when the restaurant was not busy). Food was not that great, especially for the price. Do not see ourselves coming back here."
Kaylene F.,"Pasadena, CA",56,5,1,2.0,3/15/2017,"Went here on a whim after we found out that the place we originally planned on eating at closed earlier than we thought. I ordered the Buffalo Chicken Blasts and a Pineapple Moscow Mule. My friend ordered the rib eye. The Mule was basically just Pineapple juice. No ginger and barely any vodka. The Blasts were basically just pure fried grease with barely any chicken or cheese, and the Buffalo sauce I think was just straight Frank's Red Hot without any butter or anything to cut it. Way too spicy and concentrated. I ended up with the worst acid reflux (which I've never gotten) and my friend ended up in the bathroom right after we left with some really bad stomach problems. We also never got any bread. Other than that, the service was fine."
Ed M.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,82,214,4.0,9/10/2016,"Great selection. Clean restaurant. Waiter as attentive. Parking is great, it's nice to have underground parking close by."
Alyson T.,"Burbank, CA",136,17,3,4.0,9/22/2017,"Great food and great drinks! I had the skinny sangria and it was awesome. Our waitress was attentive and quick. Our party only shared appetizers, wish some were a little larger servings given the price but still very tasty! We had the Asian chicken tacos, egg roll platter, taquitos, and nachos. Highly recommend"
Thalia L.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,5,2,1.0,6/13/2017,Lemon herb roasted chicken absolutely horrible i received bone with no chicken mashed potatoes was good along with veggies
Thao N.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,28,7,1.0,2/25/2017,"Yikes! I dined here last night from 1030-1130pm. I wish that I didn't waste an hour of my life here. Ray, the server,  was unhappy and apathetic. He only smiled at the end and said something funny when we were paying. The food was awful. My friend ordered their cheese stick which she hated and don't even finish. I ordered the Nashville hot chicken nuggets and mini crab cakes. I love crab cakes, but these were greasy and not firm. I couldn't grab them at all. I put a lot of tartar sauce on the crab bites to get some flavor. The chicken nuggets came out late. They were the only thing that was hot, but the bottom side of each piece wasn't coated in hot sauce. The top barely had enough to get the red color on the chicken. I forgot to mention that the bread was cold and the butter was so cold that it wasn't spreadable. Overall, $43 was wasted on ok service and fast food quality good."
Esther K.,"Arcadia, CA",315,825,2224,4.0,1/2/2016,"This Cheesecake Factory is always packed! It is not surprising to see the crowd of waiting people go out the door here, especially at dinner time. It is pretty crazy, especially considering how much seating they have available inside. It is a large restaurant! Parking is either street parking or one of the public parking lots; the one I usually park at is just a block away on Green. The last time I came here, I was with JC and we were seated at a table on the Fair Oaks side, with large windows letting in a ton of natural light. My favourite part about coming to The Cheesecake Factory is their complimentary bread! I usually always love white bread more than brown bread, but this place is the exception. Both breads are delicious, but there is something extra addicting about the brown bread. So good! My friend ordered an omelette with potatoes and even more brown bread! I don't remember which omelette she got but she liked it. I just ate a few of her potatoes and that was it. I ordered their BBQ Ranch Chicken Salad: Avocado, Tomato, Grilled Corn, Black Beans, Cucumber and Romaine All Tossed with Our Barbeque Ranch Dressing; Topped with Lots of Crispy Fried Onion Strings for Crunch. It was really good! Next time I would get it without black beans, but I liked everything else. I really liked that they added onion strings to the salad, yum! The portion sizes here are large so I had enough salad leftover to bring home. Combine that with the leftover bread from our second basket and I had enough for another meal. I have to admit that I was not always a big fan of this chain restaurant, but I have since changed my tune and now I love it. I would come back just for that bread alone..."
Nina H.,"Corona, CA",1,36,8,3.0,5/20/2017,"Just had lunch at this Cheesecake Factory location. We had to wait, but not too long. Maria B our server was so nice, helpful and accommodating. I got the tomato basil mozzarella on a thin crust. Perfect for a light lunch. The tamale appetizers were really good too! My husband ordered Jambalaya. He said it was ok. He said he remembers it tasting different/better. My 12 yr old son had the bang bang shrimp. He loved it. Couldn't finish it all. My husband is wearing a temporary ortho boot so he walks slow. A female manager almost rudely ran him down. I guess he was walking a little to slow. All in all this was a nice lunch outing w/ the family. I would eat her again only if everyone in my party wanted to eat here. But I wouldn't specifically go out of my way. Would I recommend to a friend? Sure, it wasn't that bad...."
Hector B.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,5,3,5.0,9/18/2017,"Came for dinner with my wife today. We really enjoyed our meal, dessert and Service. The restaurant Manager and Servers went above and beyond to ensure we had a wonderful dinner.  Thank you Cheesecake Factory, looking forward to our next visit."
Victoria M.,"Los Angeles, CA",25,38,10,2.0,10/8/2016,I got a to go over of ahi tuna salad. There was so little avocado I thought they had to forgotten to add it in. So disappointed in the food I got especially because I had to pay over $20 for my meal. Huge proportions of tomato and two slivers of avocado. Wasn't even full when I finished my meal. Won't be returning.
annie c.,"Rowland Heights, CA",0,14,,2.0,2/12/2017,"Disappointment.  I used to think they were really good .  But today I ordered chicken piccata and kids pasta for my son and both pasta tasted old.  Like yesterday old and reheated in microwave.  2 bites in, what do I find? A giant piece of plastic!!!  Probably saran wrap.   So why 2 Stars instead of none? The waiter was really nice.  Told the waiter, he was very apologetic and offered free desert.  Made me feel a little better.  But seriously, you can't bother to boil noodles and need to microwave?!  My bill still ended up being $50 for microwave food."
Tanya T.,"Pasadena, CA",0,76,,5.0,6/16/2017,"This location holds a special place in my heart; its where me and my now husbands went on our first date. I always order the calamity,lemon picatta pasta , jack and coke and of course the cheesecake!!!"
Vic C.,"Duarte, CA",52,2,2,1.0,2/13/2017,"Terrible, ruined my Sunday evening. We arrived early, got seated right away because there wasn't any line. But we were waiting almost an hour for our food. The waiter said it's backing up in the kitchen. Who knows, he may have forgotten to put in the order? By the time the food came, the fries are soggy. What kind of service is that? Last time on another location, they mixed up my leftover with someone's left over salad! Oh! My."
Dre A.,"Covina, CA",131,69,78,3.0,2/3/2017,"Ive been here before and it was great. So i went again for my birthday recently. Our waitress was very nice, and I ordered the  lemon couscous chicken. It took about 30 mins for our food to arrive. And the table next to us got their food before us which I thought wasn't right. The food was really good but I didn't like how crispy my chicken was. It was like a deep fried fish. Not in a good way. It's a good thing there taking it off the menu."
Susan N.,"Fullerton, CA",0,176,23,5.0,2/19/2017,"My husband and I were craving salads so we stopped by the Cheesecake Factory because they used to have amazing salads. He ordered a Cesar salad and I ordered a French country salad and added salmon to it. The salads took forever to come out and once they did, I asked the food runner what the hold up was and he explained that the first piece of fish was overly cooked so they had to fire it up again. Anyway, we had waited for so long as this point that I was already beyond annoyed. Then I hungrily dug into my salad and omg it was AWFUL!!! Omg awful so bad I spit out the super salty beet into my napkin. I let the server know it was gross when she checked on us and that I had waited forever on food already and so she had the manager come over. The manager was a lady named Loretta and she was WONDERFUL. I was so damn pissed and disappointment by the wait and the salad but she was soooo cool and understanding and comforting. She took the salad off the check and offered to bring out anything that sounded good to me. I thought about it and was over the idea of eating anything else but in the end I left pleased and impressed that Loretta handled the situation and my crappy attitude like a true professional. She's an exemplary manager and truly truly truly made the difference in my experience. The check was less than 30 bucks so it wasn't the money but it was her willingness and true care to make sure the guest leaves happy. No questions asked Cheesecake Factory Pasadena is lucky to have a lady like Loretta on their management team because had the situation been dealt with in another manner I can assure you I would've left pissed and left 1 star. Loretta you're the real MVP, thank you for sending us off with a positive experience"
Kiki S.,"Irvine, CA",1,34,,1.0,2/6/2017,"Went here on a Saturday for a birthday and the wait for getting menus, getting to order, getting the bill was absolutely ridiculous!! We were there until 11 pm when we got there at 8 pm because of how long it took them to come to our table. It didn't even look like it was busy. Will definitely avoid coming to the location especially on a weekend! Horribly slow service! In addition to the horrible service my steak was suppose to be medium rare and half of it was medium rare and the other half of the small pieces was rare. Do not recommend this location!"
Chris K.,"South Pasadena, CA",0,2,1,3.0,11/12/2016,"Pros: - Food is delicious - Service Cons: - Too many calories in each entree - The cooks We received our pasta, with next to literally no sauce. We contacted our waiter, who told us they would get the sauce, and it would only take 2 or so minutes.  IT TOOK 21. When the sauce came in a small bowl, it was only 1/16 full! Like, what the heck! Overall, I would have rather gone to another restaurant where we would be getting our food on time, and have it be WORTH it."
Leslie T.,"Santa Ana, CA",280,213,83,1.0,11/8/2015,"Do not go here! I just came by to pick up 3 cheesecakes. The pick up took 20 minutes, and there was really only one couple in front of me! I just got home to eat my cheesecake that I had waited so long, and drove so far for. There's freaking hair in the cheesecake and the whip cream!!!! How disgusting is this?! $26 for cheesecakes with hair in it!  I have platinum blonde hair, so you know this isn't my hair! Im so disgusted I barely took one bite and a chunk of hair was in my bite!! I want to throw up! I wasted gas and time, to get these disgusting cheesecakes! Do not eat here! Don't waste your money!! Service is rude, food is tainted with nasty strangers hair, no just no. This is not acceptable, not for a pretty pricey restaurant."
Hannah N.,"Los Angeles, CA",10,5,,4.0,5/22/2017,They have my favorite starter dishes. Avocado egg rolls is so go. They have the great staff. American breakfast- brunch open much later. I love the way they cook.
