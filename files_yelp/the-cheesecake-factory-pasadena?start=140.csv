Kaylin O.,"Los Angeles, CA",219,887,306,5.0,7/14/2016,Great service all throughout!  Thanks for the wonderful experience with my toddler and infant.  We appreciate the thoughtfulness in the plate of bananas and bread for my babies.  We also like the sanitary lining for the diaper changing station. I had forgotten mines and that really came in handy.  The food was good.
Baby D.,"San Clemente, CA",143,3,,1.0,5/10/2017,"I came here to celebrate finishing up a job interview and unfortunately forgot my ID. Was refused service, not only that it was too much to speak to a manager. Terrible service. I've never been to a restaurant and treated in that demeanor."
Susan K.,"Los Angeles, CA",91,236,988,2.0,1/3/2017,"We came for an early dinner tonight. The restaurant had plenty of empty tables but they let the waiting area get completely full. It took 30 minutes to get seated at 4pm, another 15 before we saw a server, 10 for our drinks (and one glass was dirty), 30 for the appetizer and another 20 for our entrees. By the end of the meal, it was an over 2-hour event. The food was off tonight. We got the jambalaya pasta and the texture just screamed ""overcooked"" on every element. The shrimp and chicken were hard and dry, the veggies were way too soft and the pasta was mushy. We also had the ribeye steak because it was just one of those nights where you felt like ordering steak at the Cheesecake Factory. The meat was tough though cooked to our desired doneness. Our waitress was as nice as can be and these two stars are for her. I know she sensed our frustration. She kept apologizing but she was stretched thin at the start of the dinner service already. Poor girl. I know I'm not going to be having a 5-star experience at a Cheesecake Factory and most especially not this location since I've been here many times but tonight was just exceptionally bad. Next time, I'll just go to Mi Piace across the street, my favorite often-mediocre-service but always-delicious choice."
Courtney S.,"Pasadena, CA",2,7,63,4.0,2/2/2016,"I always order the Pasta da Vinci. I love the flavoring and you can't go wrong with pasta. However, I decided to try something new for lunch. I ordered the everything pizza (toppings: sausage, pepperoni, peppers, onions and mozzarella) with a soup on the side. The pizza was average. It did have a crunch to it but I would rather go elsewhere for pizza. The soup of the day was the tortilla soup which was also average. At least I still had the Honey Wheat Brown Bread with butter - it's seriously the best bread ever!!  I think I'll just stick to my regular order of Pasta da Vinci in the future."
Rolo M.,"Los Angeles, CA",135,250,58,2.0,12/21/2016,"NOT as good as the Arcadia location.  We went for lunch and the food was NOT good.  The service was great but the veggie burger was horrible, with old greens, water that tasted like it was imported from Tijuana.  I won't go back unless I need to use the restroom or someone takes me there for free drinks."
Karena L.,"Monterey Park, CA",14,3,13,1.0,10/5/2015,"To management, I rarely file complaint because I was from restaurant business, but this time I really have no patient, at all! pls find my complaint below.  1. Server didn't bring the bread even my appetizer already came.  She said she would get me some, until I have to eye watching her ""3 times"", then ""finally"" she remember  2. No follow up our table at all.  No refill nor take the empty plate away I was so glad the server who was took over during her break (I forgot her name), she helped us do the refill, plus another sever who just ""walked by"", she helped us took the empty plate away.  Pls note, the tips I gave is for those 2 person, who help us out, not for the server Alyssa, who basically didn't provide any service. Thx for your attention!"
Elite T.,"Los Angeles, CA",390,97,2807,5.0,2/4/2016,"Came here after a long long time. We got our seats right away which is pretty good , well it's on Wed night which is not as crowded as weekend.  I love their da Vinci, but I tried new dishes ,Cajun Jambalaya pasta. Huge portion with kicking flavor!  Having dinner at cheesecake factory isn't valid til we order the cheesecake. LoL!  1 slice of 30th anniversary cake and 1 slice of kahlua kahlua cocoal coffee cheesecake.NYAM! SUGAR OVERLOAD!  The server is so friendly!! I forget her name tho :("
K W.,"Woodland Hills, CA",93,12,,3.0,8/12/2017,"I use to go to the cheesecake factory all the time, haven't been in months. Very disappointing,  I order the chicken and biscuits.......no flavor what so ever and the gravy looked like water. For a $18 dish the food should be amazing. I use to order this same dish before and it was 10× better. I think this will be my last visit for awhile!"
David S.,"Pasadena, CA",74,50,,5.0,2/13/2017,"Friendly staff and the happy hour appetizers are large, tasty, and very reasonably priced. A lively environment."
Neil G.,"Los Angeles, CA",1011,552,1147,4.0,7/17/2015,"Okay! Let's get something straight here... Whether it's a mom & pop or a corporate chain, you just can't deny good food! ...and Yes, Cheesecake Factory whether you  like it or not has some hands down pretty darn delicious lean and mean dishes! We arrived at the Cheesecake factory anticipating a long line, surprisingly eventhough there was quite a few of us waiting to be seated (it's a Friday night mind you) we didn't have to wait long.  Service was okay, our server took our drink orders while we browsed the menu; It's one of those night that calls for a flavor packed dish - ""Cajun Jambalaya Pasta!"" This very generous serving of Shrimp and Chicken Sautéed with Onions, Tomato and Peppers in a spicy cajun sauce really hit my cravings for tonight, I love how the spices did not over power each other giving this dish a nice balance between heat, flavor and spice. Served on top of Linguini pasta, this dish will sure fill you up! It's really good! When you are at the Cheesecake Factory - you MUST save room for dessert! A slice of Chocolate Mousse Cheesecake for my friend and a slice of the Original Cheesecake for me! ""Sharing is caring"" we split up our cheesecakes so that we could both have a taste of this sinfully delicious slices! Absolutely divine! The Chocolate Mousse cheesecake felt light and airy yet so rich and decadent! The Original Cheesecake in my opinion was pretty darn good - just the right amount of sweetness, a slight hint of tart, creamy and overall just decadent. I LoVE it! We had such good time at the Cheesecake Factory, Delicious dishes and amazing desserts, I really didn't mind the short wait, there's plenty of visual distractions in the waiting area - cheesecakes of every size and color, cakes layered so high and looked so sinfully good!!! So get your train of thought out of the rut about corporate and non-corporate restaurants - whether the food was prepared by your momma or by Executive Chef Boyardee... Good food is good food, plain and simple - so enjoy!"
Alan N.,"Alhambra, CA",98,106,270,5.0,12/24/2014,"Ordered two plates: crusted chicken with spaghetti (there's a fancier name for it but I don't remember what it was but that's like basically what it is) and the Alfredo. They were both amazing and huge in portion (better be, I mean about 15 bucks a plate?). I do feel like the spaghetti isn't that special especially for the price but the chicken is good! The Alfredo is like one of the best ones I've ever tasted so that would be my recommendation Just because it's an expensive restaurant, I always do this thing where my friends and I would just share a plate and just split the bill. Also, service was very professional which is good!  Would come back!"
allie v.,"Glendale, CA",89,67,47,4.0,12/16/2016,Always good and reliable. Went to the Pasadena location for a business lunch and couldn't talk to clients due to music Being way too loud. We had to practically yell our order to the server. Please lower  the music a smidgen? Other than that great food and friendly service.
Christine P.,"Los Angeles, CA",11,12,10,5.0,2/6/2017,This weekend was the first time I ever walked away from this restaurant completely and 100% satisfied. Our server Erica G. was beyond outstanding! She was so friendly and had no problem helping us with any questions we had. Anytime I ever go to this restaurant the servers pretty much rush you out. But Erica was a complete profesional and gave outstanding service. Thank you Erica G. For such a great experience!
Poom C.,"Woodland Hills, CA",9,11,54,2.0,8/9/2016,"We were a party of 6 on a Monday night @ 7.30 p.m.....not exactly peak dinner rush hour. Our food took forever to arrive, and when it did, one order was incorrect (cobb salad instead of club sandwich). One friend received his food when the rest of us were half way through our meal. The spaghetti carbonara was very dry and the spinach artichoke dip was cold with little melted cheese. My wife ordered the same 2 dishes at the Cheesecake Factory at Topanga and BOTH were excellent. I've dined at many different CCF's around the country and count of them for a fine and very hardy meals but Pasadena was very disappointing. Sorry."
Lana S.,"Glendale, CA",0,7,,1.0,6/4/2017,"This location is a bad Cheesecake Factory restaurant, very disappointed of there customer service and They are slow in serving. Go to a different location."
Sandra L.,"Lakewood, CA",874,112,1057,4.0,6/15/2015,"The fried mac n' cheese appetizer is the best thing on the menu!! (No joke, it is that good). It consists of 4 fried balls with ooey gooey super cheesy Mac n' Cheese and topped with a red sauce and Parmesan grated cheese.  Now that I got that out the way, the restaurant is beautifully decorated and clean. The food is great and the honey oat bread they serve to all guests is yummy!  Oh and you must make room for a slice of cheesecake (it's a pretty big slice for $7) and they have a ton of flavors to choose from! :)"
Alemar 0.,"Downey, CA",0,19,1,4.0,3/12/2017,This place is the most beautiful view and great meal but I give the costumer service great but in December 31 2016 a waitress was the most laziest waitress I have ever seen in my live my father had to go out to get our drinks and to come back and that lady is a greedy waitress because she only comes quick for tips like why but besides that I like this place
Bo L.,"Los Angeles, CA",16,288,333,1.0,9/7/2015,"READ THIS 1ST (you can read the rest if you want or not. It doesn't matter. It's not like Yelp pays me to write.)  I remember seeing this food documentary that showed how huge food companies try to make their food as sweet as possible so that it tastes good and is addicting. That is what I feel The Cheesecake Factory is. It's use of cheap overly used sugar keeps you coming back for more.  If you come here, you're only wasting your own time and money.  REST OF THE REVIEW BELOW: 1st Visit (take out): For take out I got a regular cheesecake and key lime cheesecake. Both were just under $9. They were both too sweet and too rich. They have a thick layer of cream cheese and have hardly any crust. My favorite part is the crust! Really a disappointment and WAAY overpriced for the quality you get and it's only 1 slice. I'd rather buy a whole pie or cake for just a few bucks more.  2nd Visit (dine in, but got no service): Why do people like this place??? I mean really. There are so many other better places to choose from.  DINING IN: Here's what happened: I sat down, was served bread and was left alone for 20 minutes. WTF? I never had this happen to me at a restaurant before. I even asked another waiter about the problem and still no one came. I didn't want to waste my time anymore so I left.  A Comment on the Menu: While I was waiting for 20 minutes I was looking over the menu and it's ALL American-ized food. Burgers, pasta, and typical breakfast & sides. The reason I'm pointing this out is because if you really want good food, in my experience, I would recommend going to a restaurant that specializes in a particular type of food, meaning if you want a particular type of dish then you should go to an Italian, Southern, or Asian restaurant. The Cheesecake Factory is like a one-stop-shop for all your food needs, which is my theory why people who can't make up their minds eat here. Next time say to yourself, ""Hey, I never had [Indian/Spanish/Peruvian/Vegan] food. Let's go there instead."" 3rd Visit (dine in): - Beet salad = slightly on the sweet side. Great combo of flavors. The 2 red and purple beets gave it a meaty texture. Pecans added crunch, but they should not have been candied pecans. Baby arugula added a smooth, mellow vibe. Cheese was creamy and mellowed out the overly sweet notes. Overall, too sweet. 3/5 - Spicy Cashew Chicken = way too sweet. Tasted like they chose a teriyaki sauce that had the most amount of corn syrup. It wasn't spicy at all. I assume it's because it's cheaper to pay for corn syrup than it is to pay for spices. I couldn't finish it."
群元,"San Gabriel, CA",203,13,74,5.0,7/24/2016,"A little bit expansive but foods are worthy. I got fried chicken pasta called Louisiana. Really tasty, chicken not juicy but nice. Try Mac n cheese burger next time heard very heavy.  Btw. This pasta was a tiny oily in the last bite"
Kailee M.,"Pasadena, CA",33,42,21,3.0,7/7/2015,"The only reason why I am writing this is because of how nasty my husbands dish was. He got the pasta with chicken and scampi sauce. It looked good except for the pool, literally pool, of oil at the bottom. The manager came out and showed us what the sauce was suppose to look like and it looked like a cream sauce which was definitely not what we got. The manager was nice enough to remove it off our bill but I don't know if that's a standard or a mess up. Either way it was discussing.  They would have gotten 1 star but my dish was delicious."
