Dth S.,"Los Angeles, CA",33,997,1,4.0,7/19/2017,wow i can't believe i haven't reviewed this place! i really like this particular location becuz i like to sit by the window and people-watch (especially during the holidays) and chow down with a brewsky after a long day of shopping in old town! all their food is the same everywhere so i won't get in to any of that here.
Ani V.,"Glendale, CA",5,70,34,5.0,7/10/2016,"Best service , good drinks! Manager was very attentive, I didn't her name. She was pretty! Blonde hair. Also our 2 servers . Service was good , we felt very  appreciated for our business as a customer.ill be back !!!"
Al B.,"Claremont, CA",0,7,3,5.0,8/12/2016,"Was craving world class service, heard many artists like drake mention ""Cheese cake factory being his favorite."" He's got good taste. My other half and I were seated real quick, waiter Bryan went above and beyond to provide us with Red Carpet treatment. I felt like a king and enjoyed every bite of the Margarita Pizza which is a large portion and the pumpernickel bread was fresh. Will be returning again soon. Keep up the superb service."
Carly Y.,"Parkway, Sacramento, CA",1,8,,3.0,7/28/2017,I've been to many cheesecake factories and this one was ok. Decent food and decent service. Parking is tough though
Elodie M.,"Pasadena, CA",3,10,16,4.0,8/11/2015,"During the weekend you have to wait 15/20min to get a table. But the customer service is really nice ! We took some salads and as usual the portion were huge !! The Cheesecakes were good, especially the Snickers bar chuncks and the Tiramisu chessecake. The desert that I really love is The Warm Apple Crisp, SO DELICIOUS ! Of course, you have to ask for a bag before leaving, because it's pretty difficult to finish all the plates. Negative : the thing I really don't like is that it's really too loud and it's very dark.... I prefer to see what i'm eating !"
John G.,"Chino Hills, CA",7,5,3,3.0,7/31/2016,"Floor plan is a bit cramped, had my not so comfortable chair bumped 3 times by the staff. Cleanliness was just average. Food was really good, had the bacon cheeseburger, a chicken caesar salad, and the jambalaya. Everyone in my party enjoyed the food and cheese cake. Go for the food and keep in mind the ambiance is below average. Prices seem fair for the quality and quantity."
Kevin P.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,38,,2.0,2/28/2016,"Ate here at 6:30p 2-27-2016.  Couple of issues bother me. 1.  Food was mediocre, nothing more. 2.  Very, very noisy.  Could hardly hear the person I was eating with.  They really need to do something about the acoustics. 3.  They now add a suggested gratuity without removing the tax!  That's not acceptable.  I tip what I want and am usually a generous tipper.  But when a restaurant does that I add it all up myself.  Thanks. Probably won't eat here again.  No reason to."
Barry B.,"Ramona, CA",88,6,2,3.0,10/8/2016,"Normally a fan, but not this time!  Trying to eat healthier and light, which this is not the place for that!  I ordered the Kale and Quinoa salad with shrimp.  First of all to add shrimp was $5 extra, and that got me 4 pieces of shrimp (what a joke)!  I know it's hard to spice up kale and get it to be enjoyable, and it definitely shows here!  If you want a bland insipid expensive salad get this one!"
Mark D.,"San Diego, CA",63,2,,2.0,4/1/2016,Great food but obviously management does not care about its customers because the place is understaffed resulting in poor customer service.   They need to stop being cheap and increase the staff because pissy help due to being overworked kills what would otherwise be a great evening of dining...
Amy Z.,"San Marino, CA",0,22,,5.0,7/18/2017,Great food and service. Came today for the avocado appetizer that was delicious. Had the surf n turf too and for dessert had the cheesecake
Thomas A.,"Altadena, CA",174,2,,1.0,2/27/2017,"The one star is for the decor.  The only thing Cheesecake Factory has going for it.  We were only looking for a quick bite to eat last night but it seemed like fate just wouldn't allow it.  We first got seated under the A/C which felt like sitting in a refrigerator. I wanted to ask to move but we sat there... waiting...waiting... waiting. Finally, being that it was so late I figured we could grab another booth in a warmer area, I got up and moved to the same size booth with my wife.  All of the sudden within minutes the host shows up telling me ""this section is closed"". I asked him to get the manager and he went off to get her.  He came back and said she was too busy with an employee right now.  He offered to move us to another booth and I reluctantly excepted.  There we sat waiting again. The place seemed to have enough staff to run a good operation but the only one's who se med to be working hard were the servers.  I have worked in this business 20 years and I work in what I would call the best restaurants in Pasadena if not Southern California.  Maybe I'm bias but I usually way over tip and truly enjoy good service.  Mind you the manager still hadn't come to my table. We finally ordered and at this point I just wanted to leave.  The food finally showed up and they placed a burger in front of me I would even feed to my dog. The bun was made from that brown bread with the oatmeal on the outside and i pretty much choked just looking at it. I could basically smell how dry it tasted.  I showed the waitress and she even agreed it usually comes out on a sourdough baguette.  I gave it back to her and when it returned it had obviously been sloppily re-stacked on the sourdough bread.  A slimy tomato was hanging out the side and there was a new slice of cheese thrown in there. (Not even melted). By this time the meet was cold after one bite I had had enough.  I told the server upon her asking me, ""I don't want this"". She said she'd make sure it was taken off the bill.  All of the sudden a manager shows up and states, "" I understand you had an issue with a burger?"" I told him I had asked to see a manager about an hour ago and I was told they were too busy.  I also told him their is nothing he could say to me to change the impression I got from this Cheescake Factory.  It amazes me that people eat here.  It is amateur at best.  There is no sincerity and everyone follows protocol like robots.  I should ha e gone to Coco's which was one of our options at 9:40pm.  If you're open until 11pm you should act like it.  I will never step foot in another Cheesecake Factory in all my life.  I feel sorry for the servers too it's a shame because to be honest the potential is their just not the compassion for wanting it."
Joyce G.,"La Cañada Flintridge, CA",302,617,2801,4.0,8/3/2015,Love their food.  Waiting area is much to be desired though.  Way to small.  Parking structure nearby.  Lettuce wraps are fabulous!!
Angela V.,"Pico Rivera, CA",607,351,2558,3.0,5/10/2014,This particular location is always busy so you might have to wait !! The times I've been here I go directly to the bar and have found a table ! I enjoyed the bar but it did take a while to get a waitress to come over and take out drink order ! We orders a cheesecake and it took a little too long for it to be brought to our table ! But it was very good and I enjoyed it very much !  They have a television at the bar so you can catch a game or just enjoy a conversation with the person you go with !! Very cozy! The one bad thing is that despite the fact that the place is always busy and they have a great clientele the bathroom was not very clean !! There was dirty paper towels all over the floor and the bathroom is not really stocked !! I think for an place that is always busy they need to make sure their facilities are clean and fully stocked !!
Roxana Q.,"West Covina, CA",818,342,1593,4.0,2/12/2014,"I'm sorry but who doesn't like cheesecake factory? Yes it's bad for you, so is a lot of other food. Yes, the menu is ginormous but at least you're not limited with options. The wait at this location has gotten much better over the years. This is likely in large part due to all the new restaurants popping up in old town.  My menu favorites are the spicy chicken chipotle pasta, bistro shrimp pasta & the shrimp scampi. For apps, who doesn't love the avocado eggrolls & fried mac & cheese? The frozen iced mango is also delicious if you're looking for a cool, non alcoholic drink option... but no one is really looking for that :-) The food is consistent as is the service. The bonus about coming to the old town location is that you can walk around & shop before/after."
A S.,"Pico Rivera, CA",0,12,,1.0,6/23/2017,We came to celebrate a birthday.   There were  15 guest.    We waited for over two hours.  Then told that only 10 could be seated the rest had to wait.   The manager dangled free appetizers and that never happened.  $8 parking for nothing. We left why give them anything we got nothing!
Hans C.,"San Mateo, CA",5,32,,2.0,11/11/2016,"One of the worst cheesecake factories. Nice staff, but food is definitely way below standard. Came out dry and bland, and the staff seem to be working hard but very unorganized"
Esther W.,"Carlsbad, CA",208,183,384,5.0,6/28/2014,"Okay, so I figure it's time to write a review on the Cheesecake factory, and the reviews here on yelp are sort of random. This is 5 stars because of the food and only the foos. Yes lines can be long, but i've been there close to Saturday midnight and Sunday evening, and we were seated right away (party less than 4).  Yes your waiter can be a bit of an ass. One waiter actually checked up on us, another time they sort of ignored us, but it didn't bother me. All the tables around us were full, and they kept filling up, so I can understand it can be a little hectic. But there is also amazing service, very fast with the bread (just request the black bread dammit) and helpful with selection. Hell they're also great to call- I lost an item and the front desk was so sweet about it! Anyways, I won't let a bit of bad service get in the way of the 5 stars-- because the food is freaking amazing! This is a great spot for dinner or lunch, the portions are huge, appetizer and entree alike, and the cheesecake makes for a great slice!  An entree I highly recommend is the eggplant burger. Yes you heard me, eggplant. If you've had enough burgers as I have, bison or angus, it's definitely nice to eat something else. The Cheesecake Factory's eggplant burger is definitely a unique treat. It's a huge burger, extremely savory and fulfilling. The side of fries is also very very generously portioned. Instantly loved! For sides, I've tasted the quesadillas, nacho chips with buffalo (?) chicken and the sweet potato fries. The chips platter was insanely huge, definitely worth it if you just want to snack with another person. It was extremely savory, you get chicken, salsa, guac, and all the cheese ever. The quesadillas were a bit small/thin, but nevertheless tasty. And lastly the sweet potato fries... No regrets. It was another huge plate of just sweet potato fries. Top notch, soft, fresh, salty and sweet, doesn't taste that oily. And lastly for the Cheesecake I taste: the something something Tuxedo cheesecake. Hahah I forgot the name oops, but I was already hooked on the fact it was called Tuxedo! It was chocolate, vanilla, and more chocolate! It did not taste bland or dull or stale, it melted in your mouth it was a sweet delight and it was damn fancy good. If you're gonna be at the Cheesecake Factory, order a fancy cheesecake right? Anyways, the dinners I've had here have been more than fulfilling (yes you can box it. In fact you'll probably box your leftovers) and very delicious. Your tummy will be very pleased."
Jose S.,"Monterey Park, CA",0,2,,1.0,3/13/2017,"Decided on a whim to come in because we were just down there street picking up our macbook.  We were delighted when we walked by and saw llwnty of empty tables and when we walked in there wasn't anyone waiting in the lobby.  Buuuuut what we didn't like is that after checking in and the girl telling us it ""would just be a minute"" and waiting about 5 minutes in the lobby we walked out before even being seated because if we couldn't be seated in a timely fashion l we didn't want to chance the service.  Sad because I was looking forward to getting a slice of my favorite cheesecake to go.  Oh well, I just take it as a hint from the diet gods that I should be eating any cheesecake."
Deb T.,"Pasadena, CA",343,647,73,3.0,6/25/2015,"I can honestly say that all of the Cheesecake Factory locations vary immensely when it comes to service and atmosphere. Our server was FANTASTIC! I loved his sense of humor and he was super attentive. The food is usually pretty good, but, this time it was DYNAMITE because my girlfriend and I split the Oreo Cheesecake. Let's just say my craving was satisfied. The cocktails are always delicious so they get a good rating in that are.  The only thing that was disappointing is that the beer glasses we were given smelled TERRIBLE!  I don't know if they were washed thoroughly but they STANK!  Also, the floors were so ridiculously slippery so they either had the floors waxed recently or they were that dirty. I would love to give another star, but cleanliness is a big issue with me so hopefully those issues are resolved."
Natalie G.,"San Diego, CA",51,67,9,4.0,11/6/2016,"More like 3.5 but there is no such option. I came here with my friend and her 2 children and the service we received was great. I'm not a big fan of chains but I do enjoy the food and variety here. I had a turkey burger from the skinny menu and it left a lot to wish for. Flavor was not there and I was not pleased, but ehhh nobody said eating healthy would be fun. I tried their wings for the 1st time also and I was not impressed at all. Overall I would much rather eat elsewhere but the restaurant is not bad at all"
