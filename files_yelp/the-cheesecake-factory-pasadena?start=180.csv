Ryan S.,"Pasadena, CA",1,6,,2.0,3/7/2017,This place is going down hill fast.  The napkins at my table were dirty and so was the silverware.  The staff seems to have accepted that the restaurant is dirty and they do not care.  4 out of 5 times the silverware and/or napkins are dirty.  The location at Santa Anita and Sherman Oaks are much better.
Patrick V.,"Arcadia, CA",69,53,351,4.0,8/1/2015,"Just like every Cheesecake Factory, it tastes good and satisfying. Their service is outstanding; but what makes me give them only 4 stars is the parking (because its in Old Town Pasadena which makes parking really difficult unless you know the area) and its affordability (all Cheesecake Factory cheesecakes are $7.95/slice). Anyways, that's how this restaurant is and will always come back."
Michael C.,"Santa Monica, CA",201,256,36,1.0,2/15/2016,"I love The Cheesecake Factory, which makes me really sad to write a negative review for the Pasadena location. Happy hour is always an outstanding value (buffalo cheese blasts, yum), but service here was lousy. Our server brought us bread, said she would return with plates and utensils but went straight MIA. We stared at the basket for so long, I had to grab a set from an empty table. The kicker was, the bread was too hard to enjoy. Such a bummer, but at least there are plenty of other locations around."
Horacio M.,"San Jose, CA",123,4,,3.0,12/16/2016,"Came here on a date and was attended by Craig whom was our waiter, Craig may I add was the worst waiter I had at an establishment like this. This is supposed to be a high respectable restaurant and I've had better service at Chili's. Craig had to go on his break (eye roll) and introduced Justine who was so much better! She made me feel better about eating here and had the best smile and great customer service. So if you come here and you may happen to get Craig as your waiter, tell him you'll rather get Justine, someone who is there for the customer. Thanks girl you made my night better"
Camila R.,"San Bruno, CA",163,53,848,5.0,1/21/2016,"Big thanks to our waitress Patty, she was so nice right off the bat!  our food was amazing and on time, and I couldn't help but leave our waitress a little note with the tip!  we're from nor cal and our experience was so nice!"
Randi M.,"Canyon Country, CA",323,886,151,2.0,12/15/2015,"The service here SUCKS.  Stick a fork in me because I'm done with this location.  I've given them a few chances and the last visit was my last.  I came for my favorite turkey burger and was told they ""might"" be out.  I asked the server to check, he went to check and came back and said, yes, out of turkey burgers.  I later spoke to a manager who said they've been out at every restaurant for a few months.  They were also out of the dark bread.  We shared a chicken quesadilla because there was nothing else I really wanted.  Once the server saw we werent ordering a huge lunch, he basically ignored us.  Sorry CF, we wont be back."
George H.,"San Diego, CA",17,4,1,5.0,12/9/2016,"Although it is not gourmet food, the lettuce wraps are always delicious.  My wife had the lemon coucous which she really enjoyed.  The lemon raspberry cheesecake topped off a great evening out.  The staff was friendly and service excellent.."
Poptropica P.,"Walnut, CA",2,8,2,5.0,5/27/2016,"This restaurant is the best place for its Filet Mignon Steak even without the sauce! Although the place was understaffed and it's incredibly busy all the time (maybe not depending on what time you come). But their food quality and their choices. Worth the trip from Rowland Heights to Old Pasadena for dinner. Old Pasadena is the best place to go shopping, eat, and have fun in this area. So If anyone is reading this and are hungry for some food. Then head down to The Cheesecake Factory (P.S the name is confusing but it serves more than cheesecakes). So I hope you make the right choice."
Marty B.,"Glendale, CA",0,7,,1.0,6/3/2016,"I've been going to CF in greater LA area for a long time... when the nearest ones were in Woodland Hills and Marina Del Rey. So, I can say I'm pretty familiar with their menu, quality of food, and expected level of service.  Everything from service to quality of food was wrong at this location which means there's a problem with management and training.  My party of five is not coming back here. Luckily Pasadena has many many other options and if I really want CF then I'll go to Americana in Glendale."
Jen R.,"Los Angeles, CA",31,68,203,4.0,3/24/2016,"Love this location. Love going to this location for lunch, it's never packed. Service is kind of slow...that's minus one star. Love the food! My favorite...of course the bread, steak Diane, and chicken costaleta."
Jett P.,"Baldwin Park, CA",45,9,12,2.0,11/28/2016,I normally have a decent experience at every Cheesecake Factory that I've visited. (Pasadena) Tonight was just unsatisfactory and this is why. Our main entre arrived way before our salad and appetizers. Waitress never apologize for the awful mishap. Never ask if we wanted more of the beverage we were drinking. I could go on and on about the unsatisfactory service we received but I need to go to sleep.  In closing for you guys to charge such high prices on your menu. Service shouldn't have to be compromised.
C.A. P.,"Pasadena, CA",0,5,,2.0,2/3/2017,"Ordered shepherd's pie $13.95 and a peach mimosa for lunch. Shepherd's pie was swimming in grease. I took a napkin and after unsuccessfully being unable to remove enough of the grease to continue eating it, I asked the waiter for help. He took the dish away, and had the kitchen prepare another shepherd's pie. After another 20 minutes, a nice man (a manager I presume) brought another order. It was not greasy-- but the potatoes were lumpy!  I ate it and paid up and left. $29.00 for two lunch items-- not good."
Chunk C.,"Los Angeles, CA",114,107,58,2.0,6/25/2016,"First time eating at this cheesecake location and had a pretty poor experience. We sat at one of the bar tops and it took quite some time to be greeted as well as to order. We ordered a salad and the steak tacos. Took us 30 mins to get them. It's not like we had a difficult order or several items. After we ate, We waited yet again just to get a box, cheesecake and the check. To complete the whole process of checkout it took 15 mins. Ridiculous. This is the second time we eat somewhere in this area with horrible service. Pasadena restaurant customer service sucks... We won't be back."
Aura C.,"Monterey Park, CA",510,463,11,4.0,1/4/2015,"I think it's pretty much impossible to not find something you will like here. Cheesecake Factory's menu is so vast, that you could go a few hundred times before trying everything on the menu.   I, unfortunately am a creature of habit. I usually order the same dish until they remove it from the menu.  I only change it up every once in a while. I had the chipotle chicken pasta.  I love bold flavors and this dish definitely packs a punch.  It's also large enough that I can take seconds home for later.  I usually start with the arugula salad. I wish it didn't have as many raisins as it does, but it's still good.  Oddly enough, I don't like cheesecake, so I have never tried it."
Leanne S.,"Sunland, CA",125,374,436,3.0,11/15/2015,"Lots of food choices, good for big groups too. They don't take reservations. Service varies from great to bad...all depends on who you get. Same with the food. Some of the food is great, other food is just ok. I like the Tuscan Chicken, most the salads, and the lettuce warps. My aunt and uncle like the chicken marsala. Cheesecake of course is pretty good too. And I love the bread they bring too, especially the brown bread. Not the place to go for an amazing meal or something fancy, but for a meal out it's okay."
John C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,9,,1.0,10/29/2016,"I was helping my brother with setting up the venue for his wedding in Pasadena. For lunch  we decided to go the cheesecake factory. We enter the restaurant, they seated us and waited for about 30 minutes without anyone coming to acknowledge us. Felt like idiots. We got up and left. This place lost my business."
A A.,"Pasadena, CA",0,9,,1.0,1/18/2017,"The cold raw spinach on the side of GF grilled salmon came with a big chunk of butter in between! Quite gross. When questioned, the waiter said that the spinach and the butter are stored next to each other and a piece of butter has fallen in the spinach offering no apologies."
Yulihanna G.,"Roseville, CA",11,9,3,1.0,1/5/2016,"I'm left with no words with the service I received at this location because there was no service at all. I have never gotten such poor service in my entire life.  1/4/16 I visited this location around 9:00pm with a friend after a long day of shopping . We were seated right away in the smallest table when we carried 3 extra large shoppers. Note that there's an entire back section with larger tables and seats that are ""blocked"". Our host let us that our server will be with us momentarily. We ended up waiting at the table for over 30mins and no one ever came. A few waiters walked pass by and made eye contact with me but no one said a word to us. Not even offering us water. We got up and left feeling extremely livid and disappointed. Sad to say that I will never return again nor to recommend this place to anyone I know."
Kit T.,"Glendora, CA",32,222,1335,4.0,12/14/2015,It is always hot and delicious and the wait is never too long. I usually come on the weekdays.  I had their crusted chicken romano and it was really a good sized dish. It was their lunch special too.
Dan K.,"Los Angeles, CA",41,180,539,2.0,9/27/2015,"The novelty of the cheesecake factory is wearing off.  First, the food is bland. That should be expected from a restaurant offering 50 dishes that span multiple food genres. Great variety to choose from, i highly doubt anything is fresh. Most would be from a freezer and tastes like it. The moment i bit into my burger, i regretted it. My kids ordered mac'n cheese. Wife got the fish tacos. All mediocre.  Second, i'm not a tourist. Why did i choose this place?  Third, the are 4-star options in all the food genres in that vicinity."
