Lia C.,"Monrovia, CA",0,4,,1.0,10/10/2015,"If I could give no stars I would. The service here is awful. I normally go to the Santa Anita mall location but happened to be near by this one.  1.I was here for dinner and no one ever brought the bread which is an automatic for any other Cheesecake Factory location.  2. No one followed up for refills or anything else, I never even saw the waiter after he took our order. 3. They took so long to bring us the desert menu that we didn't even want cheesecake after that.  4lastly they took forever to bring us the check and charge so we could leave . Awful service."
Carmen W.,"Alhambra, CA",186,98,107,3.0,8/30/2014,"Let me pre face this with the statement that I LOVE Cheesecake Factory, okay? I've been coming here since I was 12 (it was a very good birthday). This review is just based on this one experience I had last night that was not consistent with the many times I've been there.  Me and my friend sat down and waited a while for our unknown server to take our orders. No one came by and I had to flag down a random server to ask who it was. HE was gracious and offered to take our order and give it to our real server. Then our real server popped up and had the most uncomfortable gaze towards me that makes it seem like he was upset that I flagged someone else down? Not my problem. I give a nervous laugh and begin ordering a wine. He does not ask for an ID even though I begin to reach for my wallet automatically. I ask, don't you need to check my ID? He gives his uncomfortable gaze again and says sure and doesn't really look at it.  Food comes and my bistro shrimp pasta has major lemony taste. It's overpowering. My friend's rice was undercooked.  Throughout our whole meal, the creepy server did not check in with us once. He really made our experience totally uncomfortable. Dude, can you at least hide the fact that you hate your job?"
Joel L.,"Cincinnati, OH",66,509,1058,4.0,7/20/2014,"This location is consistent with others.  We had a group of four, had lunch at 2PM on a Thursday and it was about 20% full. The menu was extensive and the food tasted great. The service, as usual for Cheesecake Factory, was excellent.  Our server was quick, polite, and attentive.  I dropped by huge glass of ice tea and it shattered everywhere.  The servers were quick and non-chalant about cleaning it up and moving along with the rest of the meal."
Aaron I.,"Downey, CA",9,15,21,5.0,10/24/2015,FANTASTIC SERVER!!! On his game 24/7 very helpful and polite. Never had better service than this! (Ray P) THANKS MAN!!
Amelia M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,8,4,4.0,8/28/2016,Great service!!! I go to this location all the time I love their menu. You can order anything and it is amazing!!! I especially love their hazelnut crunch cheesecake a new arrival in their already delicious choices Always a great time and good food. And oh love their  bread and butter
Peter P.,"Glendora, CA",1,5,,5.0,2/11/2017,Eggplant Parmesan always hits the spot!
Seda E.,"Pasadena, CA",0,3,,1.0,8/12/2016,"There was a spider in the food.!!! There was a freaking spider!!!!!!! They did nothing.! Oh that manager was a bitch. She was being condescending and not helpful at all.  She said ""Oh well."""
B B.,"Burbank, CA",0,31,1,2.0,5/8/2017,"We've eaten at several different Cheesecake Factory restaurants over the last 20 years, including this one. But this particular day was not a good experience. There were 4 of us. The pluses: wait was not too long, surprisingly, since it was 1 pm on a Saturday, and the server was personable when she first came to the table. The negatives: We asked for the soup to be served while we were waiting, but it was delivered about one minute before the main course. Unfortunately the 3 other people at our table received their meals way before mine and were half way through eating before mine arrived.  No apology. The server came back one time to top off our water and didn't bother to ask how things were. Our plates weren't cleared until she decided she needed the table.  The salads appeared to be adequate but the pizza I ordered was disappointing. The crust was thin and flimsy, and the toppings very sparse.  Next time I think we'll drive further and go to the one in the Grove or the Americana."
Liza P.,"Los Angeles, CA",45,103,57,3.0,5/15/2014,"Dear god... Why must they drown their food in garlic??!! Don't get me wrong, I love garlic, A LOT.... But this I CANNOT handle. They have decent dishes that are partially ruined by this. One redeeming quality? Cheesecakes galore! Yum.  Service is usually pretty good, bordering annoying."
Rachel R.,"Covina, CA",107,145,7,4.0,5/27/2016,"Love this place. Service was friendly however food always takes a long time. If you want a dinner that you can get in and out quickly, this is not the place. Food is good, just plan to spend a couple hours min there."
cyndi t.,"Alhambra, CA",3,72,8,1.0,12/3/2016,"The manager that runs this place is full of shit. We ask for double servings of spicy chicken on our nachos and as the manager expedite she only gave us a serving of chicken while claiming she gave us two. She said for each serving of chicken she gives 7 oz per serving. Since we ask for more chicken shouldn't she give us 14 oz of chicken yet when we got our nachos we got maybe at most 4 oz. She tried arguing with us on how they measure every amount of meat that they serve. Yet, out of her own good heart she decides to not charge us for the chicken we order and that she promise for another 7 oz of chicken. As we got the extra chicken we ask for she probably only gave us another 3 oz. I'm pretty sure we got less than 14 oz of chicken (more like 8 oz total that after she promise another serving of chicken) she dared charge us another $3. I don't mind paying for what I ordered but how would you feel if someone short change you. Such an unprofessional manager she argue with us and lied to our faces saying that she put double servings yet she didn't. I used to plan for meal servings and I guarantee you that we had at most one serving of chicken (7oz). To be fair if the manager was really sure of the serving size why not bring out the scale and if you are right I will pay for what I eat. If your wrong then you should apologize and not charge for the extra chicken.  We also ordered the egg roll sampler which was great because you get to try four different egg rolls. Avocado was the best but at the same time it hard to mess up with Avocado egg roll. It also hard to mess up with nachos.  If you are planning on cutting short on meat portions maybe you shouldn't tell people about the exact amount of oz you serve for your customer. As a scientist, we do conversion and weigh things on scale everything so I know I didn't get what I paid for. I been to this location before and I ordered the nachos and this was the first time I had such a bad experience. All it takes is just that one bad experience.  The nachos taste delicious but after that encounter with the manager and server they made me feel unpleasant and uncomfortable. I hate it when people straight up lied to my face.  Let's talk about customer service at this location. We had to flag our waitress 3 times to get their attention to get water or any sort of service. On the check they ask for 22% tip yet they didn't really serve us or ever once check back on us. How dare you ask us or demand us for tips when you didn't even do your job. This was at 5pm when there's many empty seats and it not like they were busy.  Another thing was when we ordered a key lime cheesecake to go the cheesecake tasted pretty old and stale. I would never come back to this location unless I have to and I would recommend people going to other locations. Worst service and food compare to other cheesecake locations by far. They deserve exactly 1 star because the food was decent."
Suzanne I.,"North Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA",24,51,86,3.0,5/31/2016,Ordered a club sandwich and they are out of turkey wth! Takes forever to get your order and it's not busy . 2 o'clock in the afternoon!!! Very annoyed with the service !!!! Worst cheesecake around
Lucia C.,"Windsor Terrace, Brooklyn, NY",57,196,14,5.0,7/30/2015,"We have these in New York where I live, but this location was quite exceptional for two reasons.  1. The wait and lines are usually out of this world for any location, even though it seemed like a lot of people were waiting, we got seated in less than ten minutes.  2. My boyfriend and I both ordered the flavored lemonade which back home is not free refill, but here it was! The waitress came and grabbed our cups quickly without saying anything and brought them back filled, we gave each other a look because we thought she was being sneaky to charge us, when the bill came there was no charge! Love it!"
Andrea C.,"Beltsville, MD",10,48,,4.0,2/3/2016,Great service!  Me and my boyfriend came here for our first date 3 years ago and we might go back for our anniversary.  Love the cheesecake of course!  The food is always good and the service is always fast.  We will return soon!
Britanni Marie D.,"San Francisco, CA",9,12,,2.0,5/21/2015,"Cheesecake factory is usuaply average but I came with my family, party of 7 on a Sunday. We were told it would be a 20 minute wait ended up being more like 45. We asked the hostess what was up after waiting the inital 20 minites and I was told out name had already been called which was a blatant lie as we were sitting directly infront of the hostess table and heard and saw everyone that was called. The hostess made excuses and asked us to wait another 20 minutes. After that 20 minutes went by I asked about a table that had not been cleaned or used for like 15 minutes. The hostess seemed astonished that she had not thought of that and had the table cleared for us. The waitress seemed absolutely scatter brained and started arguing with my mother about the selections on the menu and possible substitutions. The food took another half an hour to come out and by that time we were full of bread. The staff seemed frustrated and streched thin and well that makes for shitty service. The food is average nothong special about it, except for the grill cheese."
Juice A.,"Downey, CA",0,4,,5.0,6/17/2015,"Excellent and outstanding assistance by Adrion and MGR Sammy. These two gents make this the best Cheesecake Factory around. Truly made us feel at home for my daughters promotion celebration, Thanks guys"
Nancy C.,"Alhambra, CA",16,115,677,4.0,9/6/2015,Over all service was good cake okay not Wow!   Chain restaurant we all know they speaks for itself. Reasonable price.
Sandy N.,"West Covina, CA",239,76,71,5.0,4/1/2015,"Both me and my boyfriend's favorite restaurant, love it here! Been coming to Cheescake Factory for years with boyfriend, family, friends and always enjoy every meal with great customer service! The restaurant itself has a cool ambiance with also a romantic hint esp if you are out with that special someone. When you enter the restaurant, they have in front showcasing the delicious cheesecakes. They also have a bar section just in case you don't want to wait too long for a table..that's more of the downside.  What to order...well, what I like to order..  Appetizers: Chicken Quesadilla :-) Crispy Crab Wontons Fried Calamari  Entrees: Love the Miso Salmon!! Shrimp scampi with angel hair..favorite Cajun Jumbalaya (yumm!! Somewhat on the spicy side) Shrimp Scampi w/ Steak Diane (mouth watering..) Desserts: (if there's any room left) Dulce de Leche Caramel Cheescake  Tiramisu cheescake Plus, free bread and butter while you're waiting for your orders. Honestly, everything on the menu is delicious...the staff is friendly and knowledgeable..weekends and nights get very busy, but the waiter or waitress always checks up to make sure everything is great. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this place!!"
T P.,"Orange County, CA",1,510,190,5.0,6/19/2016,"We came here on a Wed around 4:30 pm for an early dinner.  We were seated within 10 minutes with great service and attention. The lunch menu prices were still good, but we all went for the regular dinner menu.  Again, I ordered the shrimp and pasta under 560 calories menu.   My coworkers enjoyed their dishes and we were in and out under an hour.  This location is consistently great, food is always good and the customer service is always above average."
Narek Y.,"Pasadena, CA",22,11,2,5.0,11/19/2015,"We love this place, always glad to go.  Stuff is friendly, nice. Craig is A professional waiter, this guy knows his job, here earned 5 stars.  And dont forget to order avocado eggroll ;)"
