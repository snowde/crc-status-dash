VERONICA F.,"Monterey Park, CA",90,10,1,3.0,5/24/2016,"I'm a a big big fan of the Cheesecake Factory and an especially big fan of their well mannered martini but I don't know what happened yesterday. I had the worst martini. First of all my not so well Martini came with regular olives Instead of their signature blue cheese stuffed olives. I was finally able to flag the waitress down and before I could say anything she said ""oh yea I forgot your beau cheese olives.... She then had the audacity to bring me a small plate of blue cheese that she expected me to stuff myself....really? Who does that? I told her that I just wanted her to take my drink back and serve it the way I've had it a dozen times before.... She took it back and returned with the same drink but put the right olives in. Unfortunately I will never return to that location again. Something is definitely wrong with the management!"
Mikaela M.,"Kennett Square, PA",4,4,3,4.0,12/12/2015,I just ate there tonight and I usually get the miso Salmon every time I go to the cheesecake factory and I think I got it there about three times this time my rice way too hard I still love the place don't give me wrong the staff are lovely but the cook should have known better with the rice I was very disappointed. :-(
J. T.,"Beverly Hills, CA",499,326,137,1.0,2/14/2016,Wow so dissapointed. Came here and they kept seating people who arrived after me and after 30 minutes i got fed up. I asked the hostess and she was like omg i forgot. No apology from her. Then she told someone to seat us in a small corner when there are booths of 4 for our party of 3. Told the manager and then manager got us a good table but table was dirty. So then we waited again. Then got sat and then 10 minutes later the server said did you guys get a menu? Im like no....this is a joke!
Rishi P.,"Pasadena, CA",842,167,124,5.0,6/17/2015,"Cheesecake factory rocks.  I've never had a dish that I didn't like.  Service is always good and food quality is just amazing.  This location I frequent a lot since I live down the street but even when i'm on the go and I need the food as take out they're super quick and never mess up.  Service he is always good too.  My favorite dishes are the Pasta Da Vinci, asian lettuce wraps and the jambalaya dish.  SO GOOD!!  See you guys again...probably tonight.  lol"
Julie K.,"Surrey, Canada",153,24,912,3.0,4/1/2015,"Waits are usually long but we were like lucky to go on a weekday where we waited only 10 minutes. We brought three kids who enjoyed the kid's menu (macaroni and cheese, spaghetti, burger which includes a drink and fries) The adults ordered garlic noodles, jambalayan and ribs. The meals were all tasty and filling for lunch. We also had the calamari appetizer which was really good."
Mila P.,"Los Angeles, CA",26,18,536,4.0,10/10/2015,"Family's favorite Steak Diane, for pasta Chicken Alfredo and Chicken Madeira...Herb Crusted Filet Of Salmon...AWESOME!"
Bhushan J.,"Alhambra, CA",74,11,37,4.0,6/19/2016,Food 4.5/5  Service 5/5 Parking 3.5/5  Ambience 4/5 I only visit for cheesecake cravings Other food options are decent.
Tad K.,"Monterey Park, CA",292,206,1103,4.0,2/17/2014,"Breeann is the best server.  Cheery, water glasses never empty, iced tea and coffee same.  Truly the best service we have ever gotten at this too busy restaurant. Food as usual was decent, with pretty good sized portions.  New for us was the Crab - Articholke dip - very tasty, not creamed but just the main ingredients . The place was extra dark tonight, but since we all had iPhones, using a flashlight took care of the problem.   One of these days, we'll leave room for dessert!"
Markie C.,"Baldwin Park, CA",29,15,1,4.0,6/13/2015,"I've been to this location a few times and both were different experiences. The first time my boyfriend and I went here was in the afternoon and our waiter was fantastic! He was super energetic, I've forgotten his name. The good came out perfect and delicious. The last time we went was last night actually, around 930pm. It took about 10 minutes for our waitress to even acknowledge us. There was another waiter attending other tables constantly but ours only came a few times to check up on us. The food came out delicious as always!"
Michelle C.,"Sydney, Australia",0,7,8,4.0,11/12/2014,"Everything you'd expect from The Cheesecake Factory and nothing less.  We were seated immediately on a Tuesday afternoon, and were promptly given menus. The waitress seemed busy but was attentive when she possibly could.  Our first batch of bread was a little hard, but when we asked for extra bread it was warmed to perfection.  I got a lunch sized salad which was so large that I couldn't finish it. It was a luau salad which was fresh, still crunchy and perfectly dressed. The atmosphere was also very friendly, and we had a great time!"
Puzant C.,"Los Angeles, CA",214,559,460,4.0,6/18/2014,"2014 YELP 365 CHALLENGE - 161/365 Only waited 5 minutes for a table, customer service was nice, but my chile relleno burger patty was dry. I asked for it well-done but the inside was still pink. Pink and dry? HUH? Not spicy either. But the bread they serve is delicious, refills are always flowing, and desserts are AMAZING."
Cheryl A.,"Walnut Creek, CA",2,4,2,4.0,6/10/2016,Great Calamari and Seared Ahi tuna salad! Waitress saved us from the bread...good service!
Dior M.,"Lancaster, CA",8,56,103,4.0,5/24/2015,Ordered the chicken medalia and diane steak. Steak was cooked perfectly but the chicken was ok. Great service and drinks tho
Michael S.,"Vancouver, WA",4468,2212,19024,4.0,12/8/2011,"Some first dates are more memorable than others. None in my life stand out more than the first date between my wife and me at the ever-busy Cheesecake Factory in Pasadena. Going back now to reminisce and laugh about the awkwardness and excitement of our first meal together is a tradition I hope we will continue for years. Our ""first date"" order: Avocado Eggrolls These crispy fried Avocado, Tomato, Onion and Cilantro rolls are a filling appetizer. The side of Tamarind-Cashew Dipping Sauce is cool. I'd prefer more spice, but maybe not on a first date, right.  Filet Mignon Well, if you're going to tell a guy you mean business, why not get the most tender steak on the menu. She did. It's a decent meat offering and comes with some fairly standard French Fries and Onion Strings. Sante Fe Salad Even if she wasn't pretending to be a ""light eater"", I was by getting this Mixed Green salad with Lime Chicken, Tomato, Corn, Black Beans, Cheese, Tortilla bits, and a Spicy Peanut-Cilantro Vinaigrette. Yummy and more calories than it should be. Chocolate Tuxedo Cream Cheesecake Want to know if you can spend the rest of your life together? Give him/her the cheesecake test. Can you happily/willingly share a decadent slice of Chocolate Cheesecake with Fudge Cake and Vanilla Mascarpone Mousse. She and I both apparently passed the test and went on to discover that not only can we eat together, but we can stay together.  Wishing all you first-date diners out there the best of times at Cheesecake Factory. With consistent service, atmosphere, and food, the Pasadena location is worth sharing a special meal (and possibly a lifetime) together. She picked the place. I picked her."
Stevo O.,"San Gabriel, CA",197,627,975,4.0,1/4/2016,"We were trying to get into another restaurant, and did not like the wait, so we ran to the Cheesecake Factory and got right in; it's very rare to get seated so fast at any Cheesecake Factory.  The view was nice looking at Colorado Boulevard and the long line at the ""other"" restaurant, who just opened.  Our server was on top of her game and immediately served us our late lunch.  I had the roadside sliders because I was not that hungry, and sliders in general are great appetizers or something to hold you over.  The wife had the lunch special with soup and salad, and the daughter had some sort of pasta with chicken and tomato sauce.  All very good and satisfying.  One thing shared among all the CF restaurants is their fresh white and brown breads.  I hazard to say the brown is pumpernickel, and the white is sourdough, just guessing though.  This year, I'm trying to cut back on butter, so I had the white bread with Italian Olive oil and balsamic vinegar, which satiated me and a tad healthier.  all in all, a very good plan ""B"" and we still had free parking left from the City parking structure..."
Kat W.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,8,,2.0,1/22/2016,"This is a review on the service rather than the food (which is usually pretty good and consistent). During the holiday's, I visited with gift cards. When my meal was finished, I inserted two gifts cards to cover most of the food and placed my credit card in back of them. I unfortunately did not notice that my credit card was not returned to me. When I came back into the restaurant about 10 minutes later and explained the situation to the manager, all she did was advise me that her servers are always great about returning credit cards. At no point did she offer to look for it other than look through a few credit card folders at the station near our table. I must assume that if the gift cards were scanned and then tossed, my credit card would have also been discarded along with the gift cards?We left and had to report our credit card as stolen and wait 8 days for a new one."
Kate T.,"Walnut, CA",4,100,1,4.0,7/14/2015,"Food- love the warm brown bread, good many choices to choose from and always has to have cheesecake after. Service- friendly service.  Price- reasonable price."
Eboni V.,"Costa Mesa, CA",4,15,20,5.0,5/15/2016,"My friend and I had thee best experience! From the prompt seating, to the delicious food dropping in an efficient time and excellent service. We had a great start to our evening, couldn't have been better."
Jennifer J.,"Long Beach, CA",39,24,69,5.0,4/10/2016,So i keep thinking someone from the cast of Big Bang theory will walk in but alas no. Came here one Sunday really late with my girlfriend and had the most marvelous experience thanks to our server Dale. He was attentive to our needs and personally handled our requests. He is the best and he was an added delight to the overall dinning experience!
Tiffany Q.,"Bloomington, IN",99,38,50,5.0,4/10/2016,"I'm here with my girlfriend and our waiter is AMAZING!!! Dale was fantastic. He was very attentive to my allergic needs, food choices, and spoke to the chef on my behalf. I hope that the manager reads this and knows what a wonderful employee he has. Thank you Dale!"
