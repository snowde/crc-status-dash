Dan L.,"San Francisco, CA",1,3,,5.0,5/6/2015,"My family and I have been dining at this Cheesecake Factory for years. Its is Centrally located in the heart of Oldtown Pasadena where the hustle and bustle of shoppers and diners crowd the character filled streets. Food:  With emphasis on ""value and portion,"" Cheesecake Factory does not fall short. Great for large groups. Trick is to order for the table. Ala-carte style. You'll be able to try everything. Everything is made to order. Tastes great. (salt really does wonders) something for every craving. Huge menu. They recently revived their menu. Pretty sad to see fettuccini and sun-dried tomatoes go.  Service: We've had many servers in the past but our latest would probably be the greatest. Nicky (not sure of the spelling) was one of the reasons i'm writing this review. She is the Filipino lady that was assigned to our table. Need i mention she is probably the sweetest most sincere server we have ever come across. Food came out great. She was very attentive and made sure our dining experience was great. Thats the kind of service that brings people back to the restaurant. 5-stars for Nicky. Good job Cheesecake Factory management! Kudos!!!!!!"
Kaori T.,"Burbank, CA",1494,793,1274,1.0,11/20/2013,"Ok look, sometimes there really isn't a point in writing up a review on the Cheesecake Factory. You try one chain, and they all should essentially taste the same and have the same reliability... right? Well the couple times I 've come here (meaning I have given it many chances), it has completely backfired. Service was terrible, having to ask multiple times for service and the waiters kept bouncing our request from one person to the next, and some were so obvious about NOT wanting to be at work that day. The (usually) always delicious breakfast sandwich was cold! It killed me as that is my beau's absolute fave go-to breakfast meal, and we wanted a treat and failed miserably.  Also, for a cheesecake factory, this place was absolutely FILTHY. NEVER AGAIN."
Nicholas H.,"Pasadena, CA",1,5,,1.0,1/15/2016,"First time at Cheesecake Factory tonight after living in old town area for 2 years. Unfortunately it was highly disappointing. We waited for 30 mins for a table, which is understandable considering it was Friday night. However, once seated we continued to wait another 30 mins before the waiter ever tried to offer a cocktail, appetizer, anything (and we love cocktails - which would've increased the serves tip/bill greatly). At that point we realized how the service would be for the rest of the night and told him no thanks we were leaving. Perhaps it wasn't his fault, they were extremely busy. But the restaurant needs a better system if they want to attract and keep customers."
Ben V.,"Los Angeles, CA",48,14,23,5.0,10/1/2015,"I always love coming here. My favorite dish would have to be the steak Diane, $19. It's steak medallions covered in a sautéed mushroom sauce, amazing!!! Definitely gonna be coming back for some more of that!"
Shab T.,"Tacoma, WA",0,6,,1.0,5/22/2016,"Not happy with being served old wings...  Even the server was disgusted. It smelled so bad, shocked that no one took notice prior getting to table Probably never good back Called restaurant next day, because night before  manager was no where to be found.  They said they will send a gift card. It's been 2 weeks... No gift card"
Bryce I.,"Los Angeles, CA",146,29,6,3.0,8/21/2015,"Three stars because it's too damn dark. Just kidding, but really.  The food was good, and filling. Place was clean and the wait time was short, even for a Friday night.  Unfortunately, when it came to dessert time, ""Boxes? No."" ""Dessert? Menu please?"" we asked our server KAREN C for a menu, and she said she would bring it in just a minute... Five minutes pass, nothing. A few minutes after that, she comes to our table and asks (again) ""Boxes? Do you want the check?"" And completely forgot the menus, so we paid and left."
G. M.,"Valencia, CA",1,65,17,2.0,8/14/2015,"I'm convinced that the whole Cheesecake Factory franchise doesn't really need to exist.  I've been to two locations, and was not impressed either time.  Their lunches are fair, but not on par with their pricing.  Soups are too salty--and I'm someone who likes salt! The only good thing there is the cheesecake.  I like the Banana Creme Cheesecake a lot.  That's the only item I'd specifically go to this restaurant for."
JV S.,"San Gabriel, CA",52,47,218,2.0,12/9/2013,"First they made my wife and I with our baby wait in their empty lobby and did not want to seat our party of 8 because 6 people were not yet there. I can understand this, but the restaurant was not packed at all and its freezing cold outside. Come on!  I mean have a bit of compassion and seat us temporarily let us order some drinks appetizers and earn some money while we wait. Instead you let us stand in the lobby getting antsiest by the minute.  The problem with today's restaurants is that no one is geared towards customer experience. Food was so so and it was just a blah experience that started poorly in the first place. Cheesecake Factory management should really train their staff better."
Eddie C.,"Chino Hills, CA",3,515,294,4.0,4/13/2014,"Consistently predictable in both service and food quality.  We typically visit during lunch time on Friday's and while it is busy we sit at the bar and tend to find the service to be a bit more attentive at the high tables.    Dishes are constant and typically never waiver off from previous visits.  Service is friendly and efficient which is great to get lunch in just under an hour.  Location is challenging, specifically for parking.  However, the garage across the street does have 2 hour free parking."
Emily K.,"Los Angeles, CA",508,297,179,3.0,10/22/2013,"The service at this location is hit or miss.  Pro:  The bread basket they brought out was piping HOT! Yum! The waiter attempted to make small talk with us. At least he tried.  The lunch menu is so worth it, especially because the portions are huge at Cheesecake.  Con: The waiter was more invested in serving the large table-- which is understandable. However, waiting for over 15 mins for the check is just not cool."
H K.,"Pasadena, CA",55,53,13,5.0,1/13/2016,Great service and great food. Always on time and the servers are awesome. The Oreo cheesecake is my favorite.
Ralph R.,"Chino Hills, CA",0,5,2,4.0,11/18/2016,I came here with my girlfriend for a quick bite to eat service was okay ... Now here is my issue my pit beed deep was really raw and hard to chew and the dip I received for the sandwich was cold although I did appreciate the staff the manager was very kind and replaced my meal swiftly
Huy D.,"Los Angeles, CA",8,13,,4.0,7/9/2015,"I only came here to write a review since we received a fantastic service performance when we were here. The waitress was really nice and she made us feel welcomed when having lunch here. She smiled and helped us the whole time, occasionally asked us to see if we need any time. The restaurant couldn't provide any better waitress out there I suppose. Although the food is not that exceptional or good or the ambience is a little too loud to get 5 stars from me (I ordered chicken salad and a slice of raspberry pie which you may wonder) , but that waitress would be the reason to make us come back another time!! We enjoyed our time here :D Well done!!"
Allison C.,"Roselle, NJ",0,15,,3.0,8/21/2016,"Came to this specific one because of The Big Bang Theory. Same as every other one. Nice area. Food was good. Service a little slow, but it was very busy. Bathrooms were clean."
Sally G.,"Los Angeles, CA",285,282,257,5.0,3/10/2016,I love cheesecake factory. I know it's a chair and serve commercialized food...but it's always so consistently good. And huge portions so you can share or  save leftovers for later. I can't exactly name one dish that stands out because they are all very good. Seating at this location can be a long wait though so make reservations. Parking in structure.
Linda S.,"Los Angeles, CA",269,185,255,3.0,11/27/2015,I've been to this Cheesecake Factory so many times but this visit was pretty bad. Don't get me wrong I love the food at cheesecake factory so many options and good for all types of food and they have an amazing selection. The reason I gave this visit a 3 stars because the service was really bad. Our server just forgot about us the whole time. I really wanted to leave no tip but that is really wrong. We finally got someone else to help us. On a happy note get the dulce de leche or the pumpkin cheesecake it's so good !
Poopy P.,"Las Vegas, NV",10,22,,5.0,6/15/2016,"This place is hopping! The dance floor is spacious and the DJ plays a good mix of top 40 and blackened death thrash goregrind doom core.  The audio animatronic bathroom attendant was a nice touch (so futuristic!) and the fact that you had to beat the high score at Galaga in order to qualify for the appetizer menu was something that I had not yet experienced. I agree that not everyone should be allowed to just order buffalo wings without having earned that right by proving their skill at nostalgic games from far better days. The only complaint that I had was that it seemed a bit counter intuitive to have to put on your skates before being allowed into the elevator which took you to the second level rink but once I got up there and saw just how awesome the light show and fog machines were, it made it all worth the falls and minor bruises. The fact that you could either exit the venue through the (well designed and aesthetically pleasing) front door or water slide located on the balcony just goes to show you how far ahead this place is to other similar establishments. Fortunately, I always pack an extra pair of trunks when heading to the Factory. Insider tip, if you want to be cool then you must know that nobody calls it by its full name. Drop the word Cheesecake and join the hip crowd by just referring to this place as The Factory.  5 stars all the way!"
Claudia C.,"Las Vegas, NV",29,5,,2.0,10/29/2016,"We normally go to the Cheesecake Factory but this one in Pasadena was truly a disappointment. The food is not consistent with the other restaurants in the chain. We ordered edamame as an appetizer and when it was served there was a piece of linguine pasta sticking out from the bowl. The server didn't even noticed. When we pointed it out to the server, she took it back in the kitchen and after 5 minutes served us the same bowl without the pasta. She didn't notice that my husband had left a piece of shell in one of the corners and the same piece was there when she brought it back. Very disappointing. My husband ordered a Tuscan chicken that was supposed to be less then 590 calories and the chicken was swimming in olive oil. He had the same dish before and it definitely didn't appear to be that way. My son ordered chicken Marsala and he found a carrot together with the mushrooms. Don't know how it ended up there. He was offered Parmesan cheese on his chicken Marsala meanwhile my daughter who ordered pasta with marinara sauce wasn't offered an ounce of cheese. Utterly disappointed by the all experience. Definitely a no no in Pasadena!"
Kristina A.,"Los Angeles, CA",78,32,201,3.0,10/28/2014,"My boss gave me a Cheesecake Factory gift card so my husband and I went to the Pasadena location over the weekend. I believe, if you are in a place like this, you have to be very, very picky. It is not bad. But it is not what it portrays to be. Just think of it as a glorified fast food place. You are there for convenience, not for top-notch dining experience. These are not homemade cheesecakes so don't expect anything gourmet or grand. These are mass-produced desserts so I recommend going for the safe picks instead of going crazy with the selection and then get disappointed later. Because they'll taste like SUGAR. None of the real thing. The one cheesecake that stood out though was Lemoncello. Then their pumpkin pecan cheesecake was a safe bet. I wouldn't recommend their lunch or other food selection either. There should be a real restaurant nearby. But if you are okay with faux restaurants, this is fine. And oh, parking is difficult to find in this area. There is a public parking nearby though. The one big plus in this place? Their customer service reps were great."
R K.,"London, OH",1,74,35,2.0,1/4/2016,"Why does it takes so long to be seated (when the restaurant is half empty), and soooooo long to get food? Poor management is why. They always seem short staffed on servers and cooks. More than once I've heard them blame delays on not having enough staff on that night. Seems to be a problem common throughout many different branches."
