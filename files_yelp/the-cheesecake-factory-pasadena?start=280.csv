Amy R.,"Arcadia, CA",0,2,,4.0,10/29/2016,"I love this place! My family and I come here all the time! Service is fast and friendly! We love the Mac and Cheese Balls to start, add the bread service and we are in heaven. I always get the Miso Salmon, my favorite!"
Catharina H.,"Pasadena, CA",142,50,8,5.0,4/19/2014,"Perfect place to spend dinner or brunch together with your loved one. I spent my birthday dinner with my fiancee at here, it was great. I love the atmosphere and the food price range was fine.The location is bit odd since it takes some minutes to walk from the station (Del Mar / Memorial park) but I usually come to Colorado when I want to walk, so that is completely fine with me but some others might have problems. Overall it's very nice place to go :3"
Babak E.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,37,5,3.0,4/2/2016,The wait was the usual 25 minutes for party of 2 on a Saturday night and they had a full house.  Sat us down on a wet table that smelled like the towel itself.   We had to dry the table ourselves.  The classic bread came out shortly after our order but it was warm and a bit stale. I got fish tacos and I don't know what really came out but the fish felt like it had been frozen for years and processed.  Not sure what happened to Cheesecake.
Jeannette G.,"Los Angeles, CA",510,808,612,4.0,2/23/2014,This is a review for the Shrimp Spring Rolls - Simply the Best!   This is the only reason I go to the Cheesecake Factory.  I usually phone in my order and just pick it up at the counter.
Petra G.,"Kamuela, HI",17,7,,2.0,12/12/2015,"Our third visit to this location and certainly not as impressed on this visit as our last. The beet-goat cheese salad was still excellent, the spicy chicken chipotle pasta was more dry and chicken was sparse and not as tender as before. Big disappointment was that the salad and pasta were served to us at the SAME time. When I asked why it wasn't brought first, I was told it was ordered and came up that way! Shouldn't servers know how to place order so salad comes up first? Had no problem last time. Also, tables are placed so close to one another (busy place & lots of people) that when the table next to us was served, the server's derierre was 2 inches from our table!! Seriously! Not impressed this time."
Mitchell A.,"Los Angeles, CA",7,117,3,3.0,12/17/2014,"3 Stars The Cheese Cake Factor is a nice place for a birthday, lady's luncheon, groups. Food quality is good, the main reason for the third star is for there desserts. My personal opinion the Restaurant/Cafe is expensive and over price."
Winnie J.,"Los Angeles, CA",210,23,25,2.0,1/13/2016,"I have been to many Cheesecake Factory locations. I am from Indiana and we have one there I've been to one in Chicago and now Pasadena. I came here with a client from work and my friends ordered a harvest salad that comes with some type of special dressing they kept telling her that it wasn't a special dressing. It was an awkward moment between the manager & her. Typically the customer is always right but not here. So tonight my daughter turned 11months and we decided to come here now granted it was 9pm and they close at 11pm. I typically order the Louisiana chicken pasta (never lets me down) but i tried something new the zesty lemon chicken which comes with mashed potatoes and carrots. My plate comes and it LOOKS delicious the chicken www great moist and tender the mashed potatoes were dry. Almost as if it is the last bath for the night and they aren't making any fresh. I send them back and ask for green beans. The green beans come out and they are burnt there is a puddle of brown oil at the bottom of the plate. There was literally like charcoal flakes on the plate. So the waiter who I must say was amazing went to get the manager. She came over and asked what I was having and I told her my issues with the dry cold mashed potatoes and now the burnt ass oily green beans. She persisted to tell me ""that's how we cook our green beans""  so you mean to tell me you purposely browned this oil and made sure they were burnt with no flavor other than hydrogenated oil. That was done on PURPOSE. B#%^ please quit diffusing responsibility and own up to the fact that this is wrong. I subconsciously felt that she thought because we were black we wanted our mean competed but that is my own personal feeling. So I asked her to taste them she looked at me like I was asking her to drink polyjuice potion. So you will serve these green beans but won't eat them  *mental note made* so I asked her ""are your green beans cooked in oil or butter"" my thought process was if the skillet was too hot the butter would brown hence for the murky substance at the bottom of the plate. Logically speaking. She leaves the table and returns and says ""Oil"" so now I'm like that's some dirty dark oil to be cooking my green beans in. She apologizes ""for me expecting something different"" which is a slap in the face offers us a dessert which I turn down and dismissed her. Her attitude was that of woman who has been beat up by life and I'm just another problem. She seemed bothered that I was bothered by my food presentation. Lady this is your JOB to manage this restaurant fix complaints. So our waiter is comes back and ask if we are getting a free dessert I said now he said ""why not"" lol so we got a strawberry cheesecake.  Positives  -my daughter loved it -my chicken was great -stroller parking"
Ali H.,"Saratoga Springs, UT",110,5,3,5.0,4/11/2016,"We came in with a party of 6 on a Monday night and were seated immediately. The food came out fast, our server was constantly refilling our water, and she brought the check out quick! I had the carbonara and it was delicious. The dulce de leche cheesecake is always a favorite of mine too. Thanks again to Erica P for being an awesome server! (:"
Mon_ J.,"Inglewood, CA",1,5,18,4.0,6/12/2014,"First visit...For starters we had the bread with butter. It was so good. The ""brown"" bread was very soft and warm. We ordered the Fettuccine Alfredo and a ham and pineapple pizza. The sauce in the Fettuccine Alfredo was very bland we had to add salt and pepper. The pizza was good and the crust was REALLY good. For dessert we had the raspberry cheesecake and it had a chocolate crust that complimented the raspberry in the cheesecake. Jay thought it was a bit too sweet, but it was ok. Mon thought it was delicious!  Second visit...again they brought us some bread and butter for starters and it was really good, as always. Jay ordered the Parmesan Crusted Chicken with bowtie pasta. She didn't like the pasta but the chicken was thin buttery and had a crispy crust, Yummy! Mon ordered the Chicken Madeira and loved it! For dessert we shared a New York cheesecake with fresh strawberries on top. Mon: it was to DIE for! Jay: I can't wait to go back and eat some of that bread and butter and have some of that New York cheesecake melt in my mouth."
Joanne A.,"Granada Hills, CA",53,7,,1.0,4/18/2016,"Went to have lunch on a weekday, after a doctor's appointment. Because we were starving, we immediately ordered the appetizers and entree all at the same time. Soup in a bowl came quickly, but 30 mins passed, no entree came. The server was nowhere to be found. When he finally showed up, we asked and he said he'll check. Another 15 mins passed, and we saw him on the computer monitor with what look like several bills, typing on the monitor frantically. When he looked in our direction, we waived and asked again for our food. He ran to the kitchen, then came back explaining he's actually in training, and he's sorry our order did not go thru in the kitchen. WHAT?! 45 mins and this was just realized now?! Granted he was a trainee, but what about his Trainor? Who checks what the trainee is doing? We told the server we cannot wait anymore and his manager should manage and train better!"
Bri P.,"Los Angeles, CA",58,60,48,5.0,9/8/2015,This restaurant was very welcoming. The servers were very friendly and courteous. I came to have dinner with my boyfriend in the evening and we were glad to receive great service because we had recently gone to a Cheesecake Factory location in Marina Del Rey and the service we received there was not pleasant. The food and drinks were great and I definitely recommend this location.
Jennifer S.,"El Segundo, CA",13,88,88,4.0,1/14/2015,"We ended up eating at this Cheesecake Factory because we were in the area. It was a saturday night and the place seemed pretty full, but they gave us a table as soon as we came in. The waiter was very nice and pleasant. The lighting at this chain of restaurants is always very low but I took out my iphone and used the flashlight lolol I ended up trying something new while my husband got what he usually gets, The Bang Bang Shrimp, which according to him is always delicious. I ordered the Chicken Katsu which was very good! I would go back there just to have it again. Essentially it is a breaded chicken breast fillet but the accompanying spicy miso sauce gives it just the right flavor. The breading on the chicken was not moist or wet which is always a concern for me, so A + on that! As far as the regular wait for your food we were very happy overall!"
Amie K.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,11,,5.0,7/19/2015,"I am new to Yelp, The amazing service made me want to write a review. Our waitress Jill was amazing!!! Great Food!!! Amazing service!!! Excellent Prices!!!! What an amazing menu to choose from. We are hooked. See you soon."
Alex K.,"Los Angeles, CA",15,33,4,2.0,2/27/2016,"My wife and I had been coming every weekend the past two months since we were obsessed with the shrimp rolls and miso salmon.  Today (2/27 11:30am)  I decided to try the Filet Mignot which I ordered medium.  The first one comes almost fully cooked, I showed the waitress who took it back to the chef.  After a extra 20 minute wait, which I don't mind as mistakes happen, the 2nd one I get is almost no different with virtually no pink, I attached a picture for reference.  At this point it had been 40 minutes since I ordered and was starving so I just ate it.  The waiter and manager was nice though so I gave a extra star for this review.  They offered free soup or salad which I declined as I wasn't looking to get anything free, I paid full for the steak as well.  But I did tell the manager to make sure the chef is trained on this, it's either laziness or pride that stopped him from getting the 2nd attempt correct."
Sheryl H.,"Alhambra, CA",6,16,,4.0,4/5/2016,Decided to stop by for late lunch. Food was very good. Always helps to go early or avoid the lunch hour rush. I didn't finish my food and my waiter was kind to offer a box before I could.
Monica C.,"Pasadena, CA",1074,494,535,4.0,11/8/2013,"Who doesn't love the Cheesecake Factory?!?!  The Cheesecake Factory in Old Town Pasadena is huge. I've never and to wait more than 15 minutes, regardless of the size of my party. The bar area is pretty large too and they have a happy hour during the week! Service is always good and with a menu that large you're bound to find something you love,"
Shirlene N.,"Alhambra, CA",33,193,167,2.0,4/5/2013,"Came here last week for lunch with coworker. Ordered off their skinnylicious menu and was good and wanted to come back this week again. Last week (dine in): Ahi Tartare - very small, one cup serving with 4 thin wonton chips (which is 2 whole wonton skin broken up, truly a single serving appetizer for one.  Firecracker Salmon - half the size, same flavor (oily) Thai Chicken Lettuce Wrap - half the size of the regular thai lettuce wrap and is pre-assmbled - my fave and I will order this again if I come again (Yard house lettuce wraps are way better!) Service - average (they had forgot to take out bean sprouts in my order when I asked but it was easily removed and brought back) This week (take out) - Seared Ahi Tuna Tataki Salad - so not worth it! It came out to be $20 for a salad! Ridiculous! The tuna was not even fresh, and was a little tough, the three slices of tomato was huge and almost same portion as the green mix (which was tossed to seem like a lot, but it wasn't, I ordered a salad, not a tomato and tuna dish with side salad. I  should have gone to Kabuki down the street and got a green salad with seared ahi tuna for half the price! Overall - cheesecake is overrated and overpriced. One good thing is their complimentary wheat bread."
Elayne L.,"Sherman Oaks, CA",259,215,14,1.0,7/29/2014,"Talk about inconsistency. I'm a fan of the Cheesecake Factory and have eaten at multiple locations. This one may have just soured my entire experience and desire to dine at another location altogether. My Caesar salad was drowning in dressing and the leaves were limp and soggy. A very sad Caesar indeed! Since the very reason I crave the Factory is for their Caesar, it will take me a while to get that craving given my last distasteful experience.  As for my daughter's macaroni and cheese, it was scorching hot and the noodles were so dry as if it were microwaved full blast right before serving it to her. If their mac&cheese is in fact microwaved, I would have never known it before. It's as if the mac&cheese's dirty little secret were just revealed to me after years of believing it was made fresh daily and not recycled from yesterday's trash. It's always been this creamy, delicious and indulgent dish I only sample a few bites of for the sake of counting calories but for my two year old, she can afford it. Not even her mac&cheese could salvage my poor meal here. Worst. Cheesecake. Factory. Location."
Kristyn C.,"Las Vegas, NV",15,27,33,3.0,7/27/2013,"It's been years since I've been to a Cheesecake Factory. I went because I had a gift card. I ordered a pizza and my friend had the lettuce wrapped tacos. I didn't like my pizza - it was hard and tasted too salty. My friend liked her tacos so I won't say the food is bad but maybe just didn't make the right choice.  Our waiter was not attentive, hardly came around and when he did he wasn't nice. However, we ended up with a waitress when he left and she was great. Another waiter came over with our bread and he was very nice too. Guess it was a hit or miss!  The highlight of the evening was the cheesecake I ordered. It was the Oreo Dream Extreme Cheesecake and it was sooooo good. In that moment I wanted to try all of their cheesecakes! I recommend this place but maybe ordering something more eventful than pizza. And definitely recommend it for the sweets! Guess that's why it's the Cheesecake Factory!"
Frine G.,"Granada Hills, Los Angeles, CA",4,12,11,1.0,7/21/2015,"I'm not the kind of person that easily goes and puts a bad review for any little thing! But last night I had the WORST experience ever....  Yesterday I had a very negative experience showing some friends around from Guatemala to a nice restaurant such as Cheesecake. First we were denied the ability to purchase alcoholic beverages simply because of the origin of  our ID's all 3 of us being from Guatemala. This is the first time we have ever been denied the right to consume alcohol because of the origin of our ID's we are all over the age of 21 and I have had no issue before anywhere proving my age with my ID from  my country Guatemala. After the waiter had denied our ID's to validate our age  we asked for a Manager which also rudely confirmed the same and that it's the law that they don't accept ID's from the country of Guatemala to confirm legal age to drink. Even after the manager pointed out in a very rude way simply cause we were ""Guatemalns"" we still were planing on having dinner. After he just left and just left us there for 20 mins with no follow up no waiter to come and assist us so we just took of and left. I ask to speak to him again before we left, at no time we had an apology from him, and still was really rude. I don't think someone before made us felt that bad and that ""excluded"" just cause of the fact of our origins... This is the last time I come to Cheesecake factory because of this racial matter and disgusting rude customer service and the last time I want to take friends from out of town to a nice restaurant such as Cheesecake. We all fell ashamed and embarrassed all because of this."
