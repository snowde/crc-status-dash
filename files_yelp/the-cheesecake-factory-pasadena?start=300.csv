Calvin W.,"Rialto, CA",59,72,268,4.0,1/29/2015,"One of the best places to go with friends, or a staple of going out with a date.   Prepare to look for parking when it gets packed since it's in the middle of old town Pasadena.   However,  the food was great and the servers were very attentive to refilling our drinks. Much so even checking up on us every now and then.  Be willing to try out new flavors with their entrees and possibly take a slice of cheesecake home,  you won't regret it."
Alisha F.,"Brea, CA",13,40,,5.0,2/12/2015,"Me and my boyfriend went last night as an early Valentine's celebration and the experience couldn't have been more amazing. The atmosphere was very serene and romantic, especially with slow songs playing and the mood lighting. Some people may find it a little dark for their liking, but I thought it was just right. The fresh bread and butter they give you was a very good start to the meal. Once we had our fill, I ordered the Shrimp Scampi ($19.99) with strawberry lemonade ($4.79). The lemonade was some of the best I've ever tasted. And the shrimp scampi dish had delicious lemon-y garlic flavor that was to die for.  The service is great as well. Our server was excellent and went out of her way to make sure we were enjoying our special night. Of course the food is a little pricey, but for the amount of quality in the atmosphere, service, and food, it was well worth it."
Tino J.,"Whittier, CA",6,171,32,5.0,1/1/2016,Stop in today for quick bite and desert service was great prices were ok for what we order can't complain
Pauline P.,"Anaheim, CA",15,10,175,5.0,3/3/2015,"The service was absolutely FanTasTic!!!  The food was perfect in every way.  I had the CAJUN JAMBALAYA PASTA.  Consisting of Shrimp and the most tender Chicken, Sautéed with Onions, Tomato and Peppers in a Spicy Cajun Sauce on Top of Fresh Linguini.  I just added crushed peppers because I like it hot! It was delicious, just the right temperature, a nice size portion, it was served quickly and the dessert was sinfully delectable!  I had the KAHLUA COCOA COFFEE CHEESECAKE which I recommend!. Rich Brownie for the crust, Kahlua Cheesecake, Creamy Chocolate Mousse and Chocolate Ganache topping.  Their coffee is the perfect complement!  I give this restaurant 5 stars and a thumbs up"
E J.,"San Marino, CA",285,49,71,1.0,7/31/2015,"Ok! Last night after a late-ish meeting a group of us decided to indulge in a little cheesecake. Apparently they were having a special event in which their cheesecake was like half price or something, we get there & as we expected we had to wait but while we were waiting we bumped into a friend of a friend & started a conversation. We wound up inviting her to the table.... That's where the good times ceased! Our waiter came to introduce himself & take our drink orders & proceeded to tell us that it had been a long day? & that most of the menu items were not going to be available if we take long to order? He then returned with a hand scribbled list of cheesecakes that were unavailable now! (Oh did I mention that he told us that he was supposed to take his break but we had been seated...was it mentioned that he was like that peanuts character with the cloud following him? Insert here.... The cloud of tobacco smoke)  While I was sitting there I was like....? Is this really happening? OMG! Needless to say, I opted out of the desired cheesecake indulgence & I just wanted to leave! I used to eat here with friends quite often. I will seriously have second thoughts about visiting this location the next time. It's really a sad thing to see Pasadena sink into a mediocrity!"
Jan L.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,17,,4.0,3/15/2016,Really love their corn cakes; they makes a rough day sweet. This location is always on point but I take it to go because they are always packed. (Good sign)
M T.,"Alhambra, CA",20,35,5,1.0,7/30/2015,"False advertisement. 50% off cheesecake,  one slice per person,  dine in only.  When I get there,  got a table and wondering what's with the crowds at the front.  There is take out......omg"
Peter C.,"Alhambra, CA",369,599,1118,4.0,11/22/2010,"Cheesecake Factory, are you the restaurant that people love to hate?  I could throw a rock from my cube at work and hit your front door, but my co-workers never wanna go here for lunch.  I would never throw a rock at you, btw.  I'm your friend.  I wish I could eat lunch here more often, but solo dining just isn't as fun. Let's face some facts, tho.  You're not exactly known for your small portions.  In fact, dining here is kind of like going on a calorie splurge.  There is a price to be paid for your yummy food, be it an extra mile on your run or more sit ups at home.  Good thing you have smaller lunch potions of many items.  Mrs. C thinks that your pasta Da Vinci (chicken, mushrooms, Marsala wine) is the bomb.  Your pizza & salad for lunch is a great deal, too.  The chicken belaggio is my current favorite.  Some people say your tropical iced tea tastes fishy, but I actually like the taste, and you do a good job making sure it''s refilled frequently.  Your servers are pretty good, too.  I've rarely had a server mess up an order, hand me a hot plate, or perform any other waiter nono's.   Please please check with me before handing over the last piece of Kahlua almond fudge cheesecake to someone else.  It's the only one I like!  Well, that's not true.  I like a lot of your cheesecakes, but that one is my fave."
Bridget P.,"Pasadena, Los Angeles, CA",814,994,100,4.0,11/27/2012,"A lot of people hate on Cheesecake Factory and how corporate it is. But good food is good food, and I've always liked theirs. The menu is huge, and the service is fast here. They even have a quite expansive ""Skinnylicious"" menu for those counting calories (I, on the other hand, have pretty much admitted defeat to fatness every time I go out to a restaurant like this. Especially when hungover).  I really, really liked my crab hash for breakfast, which was generous with the crab. I did not like my $4 warm OJ. My friends loved their southwest chicken hash, and chicken tacos. It was a nice, relaxed way to spend a Sunday morning.  This location isn't as pretty as the Brentwood or MDR locations. But holy crap, they make up for the lack of scenery with the gorgeous men they hire as servers. Both the single and taken ladies in our group admired the views the whole time. Thank you, CF HR person; it's obvious you enjoy your job."
_annahh M.,"Los Angeles, CA",42,108,31,5.0,12/19/2015,"My Bellagio arugula chicken is always to die for-hunny loves his orange chicken and brown rice, Gordy, peanut, Rari and posh love variety...and the blue cheese here is my favorite of all restaurants- We always want to have desert, it never happens...just to full and can't torture myself-always left overs to take home...lots of food, exceptional service, affordable.every plate I've had here never a disappointment"
A P.,"Portland, OR",3,103,105,3.0,6/3/2016,"First let me give a shout out to MELODY... She gets TEN STARS! We always try to sit in her section because she had such a warm and cheerful personality and always makes sure we have the best experience possible.  I'm going for 3 stars because no matter what I try here in rarely impressed (the Thai glazed salmon is a must though... And I'm not a fish person). The hosts and hostesses are always SO UNFRIENDLY, and there isn't great consistency with the food and it is often bland, overlooked or stale. Somehow we end up here every other month or so because of the variety of food (there's something for everyone), but I'm quickly reminded it's just not worth the hype. I'd say I rate other CF locations about a 3.5-4/5, but this one is only getting three for the service of ONE individual (like I said- horrible host situation and other wait staff).  Pretty sure we'll be phasing this one out now that we've discovered that 'lette macarons across the street is more satisfying for desert!"
Savannah S.,"Ontario, CA",1,1,5,3.0,3/6/2016,"I have been a huge fan of The Cheesecake Factory almost all of my young life. I have never had a bad experience, until recently. The menu has been changed in the past year, and I'm still trying the find an entree item I like through trial and error. The one item that has never failed me is their fried macaroni and cheese balls. So I was extremely disappointed when at 12:30 on a Sunday, my party and I were told they were completely out of macaroni and cheese balls. We were so disappointed that we actually left and went to the Arcadia location. I would have loved to give them 5 stars, but I have to lower my rating due to them being out of a hot ticket item very early on a weekend."
Caht Nd Baht ..,"Glendale, CA",28,14,10,4.0,5/16/2014,these guys are super cool. very friendly staff. Peter was our server for the day. we were messing around with the host up front and made her tell peter we were very scary people. Peter was nervous haha.  we didn't want to eat anything heavy so caht ordered a margarita flatbread. which was honestly very small surprisingly! caht still shared her pizza and gave me a couple slices. I had the laulus salad (most likely misspelled it) this was honestly bomb ! it was so good and enough to enjoy with a person.  every was going good until they told me they didn't have the caramel sweet shake. but the Oreo milkshake was really good.  always fun visiting cheesecake defiantly give it a try if your around one.
Hamad A.,"Pomona, CA",4,13,,2.0,5/23/2016,this resturent was not good at all. all of my friends told me that is good. Howerver; it wasnt good for me. the service was good and the employers were kind. The food was not good.
Janice B.,"Long Beach, CA",191,39,22,4.0,10/8/2014,"I like going to this location. (I like Old Town Pasadena overall.) This area gives me fond memories of when I was young and would hang out with my sister and older cousins (oh and the ""kuyas""). So it already leaves a positive memory in mind. So here's my mini review. The ambience is great inside. Service was wonderful. Food was delicious. I got the Chicken Piccata. Yum. Parking is in the structure, but other than that, overall great experience."
Samantha-Nicole S.,"Palmdale, CA",154,65,55,5.0,8/20/2015,"Probably one of my favorite cheesecake factories that ive been to. The service is very good they are extremely friendly and helpful. Fast service we sat down instantly, ordered and got our food very quick. The pizza was nice and hot and delish, the salad was huge and yummy, and the spring rolls i got were the best spring rolls I have ever had no lie!"
Natalie K.,"Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, CA",1164,913,2031,3.0,9/18/2012,I decided to have lunch with one of my friends here because they have a lunch special deal. We arrived around 12:30pm and got seated right away. There were a lot of business professionals working in Pasadena there for lunch. My friend had the pizza and salad lunch combo. It was a great deal at $11-12 for a personal size pizza and a garden salad. She had leftovers. I ordered the lunch-sized salmon at $13.99. At first I thought it was kind of pricey but the piece of fish was huge! I opted for the miso salmon and it was delicious. It's served on a bed of white rice with special cream sauce and miso reduction and some snow peas. The biggest complaint I have is around the wait. We waited almost 20 minutes for the food. It's a good thing they brought us some bread to chew on while waiting because we were starving. There are also a lot of servers working but when it came time to pay we couldn't find anyone to help us. Our server was very nice though.
Grace F.,"Glendora, CA",36,53,588,4.0,11/21/2014,"I had the bbq chicken salad lunch portion. It was huge! I didn't finish it and was way too full for dessert. I'm not sure you can call it a low calorie meal.  Everything was fresh, avocado, tomatoes, greens.  It had only like 8 small pieces of chicken on the entire salad though.  The waiter was bubbly and very nice."
Angel C.,"Covina, CA",0,2,,2.0,8/29/2015,"I've been here twice The services were great! But!!! The first time I had a pork chop, and I got the plastic in my food... The second time I had the fried avocado as my appetizer, AND I STILL GOT THE PLASTIC in my food...   Again, tasty food and great service JUST NOT THE PLASTIC AGIAN PLEASE!!!!!!!!!"
Maribeth H.,"Beverly Hills, CA",297,409,448,4.0,12/6/2012,"God I hate this place. It's just so effing delicious and bad for you. I always try to order something like lettuce wraps and then wind up eating half of someone else's slice of cheesecake. Now that they no longer have that evil chicken and biscuits, which was my kryptonite, I am at least able to resist most of the food menu. In regards to this particular location, it's smaller than the average one I think and always feels really busy. You can usually snag a seat at the bar pretty quickly instead of an hour wait with a buzzer. Watch your credit card here. The server didn't return mine and I had to go back and ask for it."
