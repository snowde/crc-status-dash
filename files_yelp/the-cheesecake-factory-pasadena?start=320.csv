Amanda G.,"Pasadena, CA",10,23,2,5.0,11/24/2014,"So I had had a really bad experience at a Cheesecake Factory prior to visiting tonight. But tonight changed everything!  First off, our waitress Katie was absolutely phenomenal. I had apologized for being in a rush and she catered to my need to hurry perfectly. All of our food came out quickly and hot.  We ordered the warm asparagus, the grilled artichoke, sliders, and the pear and blue cheese flatbread. All were amazing.  Not only that but she was on top of refilling our drinks and making sure we were okay. Will definitely be coming back and hopefully get Katie again. She truly sets the highest standard for service."
Annmarie M.,"Covina, CA",407,624,459,4.0,6/25/2013,"I just typed an entire review without signing in first and now I have to do it again. :/ This one will be much shorter- !!!- Came in at 3 pm for a late lunch. Off hours are the best time to come , there wasn't a wait. The meal was perfectly acceptable, but had I waited an hour or more, not so much. Bread and drinks came out pronto. Had a tossed Cobb, and club sandwiches for my lunch mates. Everything was great, fresh, large. Waiter was fine, food a bit slow to come out, and there was a time when he went MIA, but thankfully he came back. Check was quickly processed, always a plus for me."
Matthew S.,"Aiea, HI",0,16,,1.0,7/10/2016,So they took the only good thing off the menu. The pretzel crusted chicken was amazing. I came in once a week for it and now it's gone. Guess I won't be going back.
Housewife 1.,"Los Angeles, CA",19,4,2,5.0,2/15/2016,Love love love whenever my hubby and I go on Datenight this is the spot food is amazing and great customers service
Mane S.,"Lake Balboa, CA",29,475,58,5.0,8/28/2014,"I'm a Cheesecake Factory fan. I have been to many different ones in different areas, however this is the ONLY cheesecake that sits you very fast compared to others."
J B.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,30,1,2.0,8/24/2015,I'd recommend another establishment for brunch/lunch next time around.  We arrived relatively early and wait was less than 5 minutes.  Had the bruleé french toast with ham.  Got the runs afterwards.  Very unpleasant.  Next.
Laura T.,"Alhambra, CA",654,338,1003,4.0,5/29/2011,"I have so many wonderful memories here. Staff here is friendly, nice, always willing to help. Unlike the other locations I went to, that offered me nothing but crappy customer service served with a side of bad attitude! (Arcadia - Santa Anita Mall and Brea just to name the TWO!) Appetizer: If you love, avocados as much as I do, then you will love Avocado Eggrolls. Just chunks of avocados in every bite.  Suggestion, if you get the Hot Spinach and Cheese Dip, don't get the small sampler potion, its not enough to go around. Always get the full potion.  Entree: When I am here, I would always get the Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta. Ooooh, so yummy, it is a must try! Always get the full/dinner potion, strongly suggested. Why you ask? Well, the leftovers taste just as good. So, it doesn't hurt to have some the day after or as a midnight snack, whatever works. Drink:  Strawberry Lemonade is totally delicious and refreshing, served in a cold cup garnished with a sugar rim. Makes one all fancy for having one. And if you really LOVE it, you can take your leftovers to go too! They give you a to go cup and refill it as well. Such nice generous people. Desert:  I know since its the Cheesecake Factory, I must at least rate a cheesecake. Well, I come to realize that, since I ate here so MANY times, I never really ordered a cheesecake before. Until sometime last year, when I was craving for some red velvet cupcakes. I ended up trying their Red Velvet Cheesecake. O.M.G! Yumlicious!  Taste just like a red velvet cupcake with a hint of cheesecake. Amazing right?! Atmosphere and decor inside the restaurant is the same in all location. But like I said before, better staff better services.  Parking, since its in Pasadena, parking isn't always free. The parking lot off Green St and the De Lacy both offer 90 minute free parking. But this location, normally has a 15 to 30 minute plus wait time. They don't offer parking validation, and you are not able to make a reservation before hand. God, leaving a review right now is making me hungry. Maybe I should come here for dinner later. Ha ha."
Ted B.,"Los Angeles, CA",10,101,57,2.0,4/21/2014,"Maybe I'm spoiled by the Cheesecake Factory at The Americana in Glendale, which is better than this one in every way! I came here for Sunday brunch. Pros: We got seated fairly quickly, in less time than they estimated for us. The service was quick, and our waitress was generally very good and friendly and attentive. It was my wife's Birthday and they put the piece of cake that she ordered on a nice decorated plate with her name written on it in chocolate, and they sang Happy Birthday. It was very well done, and that really made her day! My wife liked her whole meal. I had the crab hash, which was very good. The cons: Prices just seem to be going up and up and up at this place. I ordered a small $7 side salad (that should be the price of a large salad!) to have before my meal. What they brought to my table was this small, I mean puny little salad with wilted greens, and the entire salad could fit in the palm of my hand! I'm not kidding, for 7 bucks!  The breakfast potatoes that came with my hash were dreadful! They looked like the cheapest deep fried potatoes that you could buy in the frozen section of a grocery store. They were basically little grease sponges! They were so greasy that they were translucent because of all the grease! And when you pressed on one, all the oil would ooze out! And those were the ""good"" pieces of potato! The rest were greasy little hard crunchy bottom-of -the -barrel crumbs that looked like they scraped off the grill just to make it look like they were giving you more pieces, but they were not even edible! And about half the potatoes were like that! I asked the server that brought me the potatoes if that was how the potatoes normally are, or if there was something wrong with my particular serving, and he laughed and said yep, that's how they normally are! The bagel I had was not fresh at all! It tasted like it was old and had been sitting around a while, borderlined stale. Then when were were paying our check, we paid for part of it with a gift card. We gave the waitress the card, and she comes back saying the card  was no good and brought  us a bill for the rest of the meal. And said we could call the company and find out why it didn't work , etc., etc. I knew the gift card was good so I told here to please try it again. So she goes back and tries it again and the card worked this time because she  punched in the numbers by hand. Why couldn't she have tried that the first time it didn't work, instead of coming back to the table and embarrassing us saying it wouldn't go through and handing us another bill?"
Zoë B.,"Downtown, Los Angeles, CA",3,10,15,5.0,1/6/2014,Asian salad on the skinny menu. Really nice and the portion sizes are quite large so even though it's under 590 calories don't let that fool you! I could only finish half! Love loved it  Service was great and the cheesecake was even better
Adelita V.,"Los Angeles, CA",61,127,160,4.0,6/14/2015,"This is the first place that gave us great seating! I'm tired of being put behind pillars and next to bathrooms. We were seated in a window on a cozy little table for two. There was as lot going on outside. It was a nice view.  The waitress was exemplary! She sounded as if she was born a waitress. I forgot to get her name. In case this counts, we were there around 11pm on Friday 6-12-15 Memo table for 2. I hesitated to try this place for so long because all I heard were stories of high prices. We ate for under $15 each meal. We ordered one drink called the Whisky Smash...BOMB! Perfect blend of liquor and flavor! But that little cup was $11. Say la veee (how ever you spell it, you know what I mean!). It was nice and my husband keeps talking about going back. WOW! I love this place! I would have only removed half a star if it were possible. A large family walked in behind us and literally shoved us aside as they rushed to the counter to check in. We waited around 20 minutes for seating."
Mike S.,"Los Angeles, CA",99,364,69,4.0,9/22/2014,"came for lunch, and must say getting there at 1130 was  agreat idea.  The food was prepared and served quickly.  the service was on point.  could not have been better...which is how a meal should be.  no problems.  nothing special just good food, good service... much appreciated"
Mimi D.,"Los Angeles, CA",870,439,2006,2.0,4/8/2014,"This location is almost consistently--and shockingly-- crowded. There always seems to be at least 20-30 min wait to get seated and yet ppl always seem to want to come here... Even when there are more interesting places to eat next door w no wait! Shocking. Oh well, it happens. I mean you can go to a mall and go to a cheesecake so why come here and do so?  Even worse, I was actually taken on a first date here. Yep, it's nice to let people choose cause then they're guaranteed to enjoy the food.... But when the food is likely to have been mass produced in those creepy giant tubs of stuff you see in cafeterias (but they do it behind closed doors here so it's more ok?) and shipped in for consumption, ya gotta wonder what there is to like. Ironically, my only other cheesecake review mentions the ridiculousness of doing so. Ohhh karma. Or, is it worse that he prob hasn't heard of yelp? Lol  Aside from being a cool looking building, def feel like I'm missing out on whatever draws the crowds... big portions? The cheesecakes do come out looking pretty though.. Who knows."
Marsha F.,"Valencia, CA",0,84,,1.0,7/21/2016,"Went yesterday.  VERY-VERY Disappointing~ First of all,  II get seated in an area that  was right infant of all the air condition vents for what seemed to be all the restaurant.  WE were Frozen when we left.  THEN  I get put in the new waitress section.  Although,  I must say she could teach the dumb girl that reached over our table to shred the cheese TWICE hovering her arm over my daughters  food.  VERY RUDE & INAPPROPRIATE.  No clue who that girl ( Not our waitress food runner maybe) was but,  brown hair very thin & RUDE! The Icing on the cheek cake was the large black hair entangled on one of our pasta dishes.  It was totally disgusting! But, what could we expect when the FEMALE MANAGER COMES UP TO OUR TABLE, DOESN'T INTRODUCE HER SELF, BENDS DOWN AND STARTS TALKING TO OUR GUEST ABOUT THE HAIR IN HER DISH. HELLLLLLLLLO! NOW, I understand why this place gets 5 stars for rudeness! Introduce your self,  or wear a suit and name badge instead of  house wife t-shirt and sloppy slacks."
Sarah S.,"Santa Clarita, CA",88,46,13,4.0,4/6/2012,"Cheesecake: Fantastic!  I don't think you could go wrong with any one you try.  I try a different cheesecake every time and have yet to be disappointed.  I love the macadamia one and the Reese's one.  Also, the red velvet was delicious, but you'll have to split it.  It's huge and extremely rich (""that's what she said"").   Food: Yummy!  They have a great selection on salads and pastas and I like that they are offering low cal items now.  You'll want to save those calories for the cheesecake. Price: A little expensive (one piece of cheesecake is about $8).  The bill for 3 was almost $100 before tip.   Service: Excellent.  They are very friendly, attentive, and they have great break coverage. Wait time: Not too bad.  Saturday night at 6pm waited only 10 min to be sat.   Parking: HORRIBLE!!!  Valet is $7 (with validation, $10 without) and worth it considering the parking lots are $6.  I drove to one lot and it was full and to get to the next lot I had to wait forever at the stop lights and figure out the one way streets...nightmare...I should have valeted."
Cathy R.,"Los Angeles, CA",141,77,2,1.0,5/24/2015,"Food was decent but their valet is sketchy. We used their valet and were not told of the hours or that they would abandon our car on the street after a certain time. When we walked over to retrieve it, no one was there and we waited a good 10 minutes until someone else came up and charged me extra because I had surpassed the time that no one had told me about. They were not from the original valet company either. Very ""professional"" in my opinion... I would come back for the food but would not trust the valet."
Desiree H.,"Glendora, CA",154,120,218,4.0,7/17/2012,"I'm assuming one CON about The Cheesecake Factory is the wait time. Since we were originally supposed to wait an HOUR to eat I guess it makes sense. However we found seats at the bar which will serve you full menu food items, so we only had to wait about 10 minutes.  I ordered the Americana Cheeseburger it was DELICIOUS! Instead of fries I ordered a side salad. Everything was really good. My bill was about $15 not too shabby for restaurant food. All in all I definitely recommend this place if you don't mind waiting or if you can sneak in a seat at the bar."
Heather A.,"Los Angeles, CA",31,36,7,4.0,8/15/2015,Food is pretty good here but I must say I come here mainly for dessert. After finishing off my jambalaya I was pretty full but I can never pass on a good cheesecake. Had the white chocolate cheesecake and was very pleased with my choice. Their cheesecake is definitely on the heavier side. Going to have to work this off at the gym later lol. Service was not too bad. We waited 20 minutes for a table and about 10 minutes for our server to come by to take our order. Food was perfectly prepared and very tasty. Took a while for our server to bring the check though. They can get pretty busy here for dinner.
Andrea L.,"Boston, MA",99,265,123,4.0,11/23/2012,"Honestly, I didn't want to come here for lunch. My friends and I decided on a shopping day in Old Town Pasadena and we were starving, but I really wanted to try something that wasn't as ""chain-y"" as TCF. Sure, there were lots of chain restaurants in the area, but are so many TCF's around the area, so I was hoping for something unique. But they didn't want to walk anymore, and one person who suggested to come here was soon followed by murmurs of agreement, so I had to come in. Looking at the menu, I saw that almost 80% of the items that I wanted to eat could be homemade at home without too much effort. Salads, pastas, even dishes like Shepard's pie and meatloaf were things that I could make, so I really just didn't want to spend money on it, being the cheapo that I was. But I was hungry and didn't care, so I picked something that sounded simple yet delicious: the cashew chicken salad. It was a hot day and I wanted something light yet filling, so I was very satisfied when I got my food. It was the $10 lunch portion, which I expected to be tiny, since it was a ""smaller portion"" of the regular dish. I loved the crispy tortilla chips, crunchy cashews, and the zesty but light peanut vinaigrette over the tender chicken and mixed greens. It turned out to be a great lunch. One thing I really wished though was better service. It wasn't terrible, but I could tell some of the waiters/waitresses were tired of their job or just in a cranky mood. We are poor college kids, so you would expect us to gobble up the complimentary bread and butter and then ask for some more just a couple minutes later, but the lady just looked bored and annoyed at our request."
Tammy C.,"San Dimas, CA",309,468,878,3.0,11/12/2012,"The location is great, parking not so great. The menu selection is extensive."
Eric V.,"Los Angeles, CA",61,85,121,5.0,8/22/2015,"It has been years since I have eaten here. Man have I been missing out. Came and ordered a couple of dishes with some friends and not a bad dish was at the table. Grilled chicken and avocado club (incredible), sesame chicken (succulent), and chicken tostada salad (fresh and crisp). We ordered placed everything in the middle of the table and chowed down. Service was amazing. Cc was a great server. Attentive and pleasant. Come on down to Pasadena and have some food. I guarantee it will be good."
