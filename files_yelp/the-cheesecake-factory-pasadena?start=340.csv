Richard B.,"Burbank, CA",565,411,1799,4.0,8/14/2015,"good food, with a huge menu, a little loud for my liking but overall a pleasant experience."
Cindy L.,"Pasadena, CA",12,234,9,2.0,2/26/2014,Yuck.  I've come here several times at the suggestion my American friends and have since never come on my own volition.  So unhealthy and I don't understand the dishes that they serve here.  Thai fusion tastes weird.  Italian is not real Italian.  Everything with any kind of ethnic angle to it is like some weird American caricature of its original idea.  For the price here I'd rather go elsewhere for some actual good food that won't also give u a heart attack at the same time.
Haso S.,"Tujunga, CA",0,38,,3.0,11/15/2015,The food was good and I would go back however the employees seemed very upset and in a rush. I realize it was a busy day and they did try their best to smile and be friendly but something was off.  I would go back again to try different stuff on their menu because I was very sick that day and just ordered a small salad.
Genesis O.,"Pasadena, CA",130,5,1,2.0,6/12/2016,Went to the Cheesecake Factory friday for date night with my Fiance and the food service was horrible. The drinks were amazing but I ordered the Crispy Chicken Costoletta and they served my fiance's food first and told me that they did not make enough mashed potatoes.... so I had to wait 15 minutes for the next batch.... we were already waiting 20minutes.... disappointed.... I did get french fries while waiting but it's obviously not the same. My fiance's orange chicken was not good at all he tasted garlic on the fried white rice...
rebekah p.,"Canyon Country, CA",62,10,65,4.0,3/23/2014,Love The Cheesecake Factory but I didn't like the orange chicken dish.   Not my favorite.
Rossella T.,"San Francisco, CA",1,4,9,5.0,11/19/2014,"As a huge fan of The Big Bang Theory, I had to come in this restaurant at least once. The real Cheesecake Factory of Pasadena has really nothing to do with the show, but it's so much better ;) we had Sheldon's BBQ burger (which was delicious and soooo well served, with crunchy thin fries and good sauces) and a slice of cheesecake. I chose the strawberry classic one, my husband the Oreo special. And they both were AMAZING. We had a great time and the staff was very nice. Great place!"
Clyde J.,"Anaheim, CA",1,7,4,5.0,4/23/2015,"Our waiter, Juan, was the most energetic person I've ever met!  He's so good at his job."
El J.,"San Marino, CA",0,22,,3.0,6/1/2016,"The prices are decent for their portion size and the food's pretty good. Dessert was pretty good, too, though I'm not sure what's so special about their cheesecakes. Waitstaff was quick & efficient. But it's always super crowded and loud. We had to wait close to an hour because they didn't take dinner reservations. I wouldn't normally come here but my friend had never been to a Cheesecake Factory (any Cheesecake Factory anywhere) and it seemed like something she should try at least once just so she knows what everyone else is talking about."
Ty D.,"Richmond, VA",2,82,14,4.0,7/11/2014,"I came here with my girlfriends family as it was their last day in town and wanted to eat since we where coming back from griffith observatory. We decided on cheesecake factory since they have never been. We arrived at 8PM and there was a 15minute wait on a Thursday night (not bad!)  We sat down and had a great view of Fair Oaks from our table. We all were pretty hungry and they gave us fresh bread that was really good. The brown bread is amazing! When our food arrived it all had great presentation and was large portions. I ordered the chinese chicken salad and that was very filling and tasty, with nice zesty dressing. My girlfriend ordered sausage and ricotta flat bread, she liked that as well and it came out on a cutting board. Her parents ordered pasta dishes one was shrimp scampi and the other was garlic farfalle chicken pasta. They both loved it and said that it had great flavor.  I gave this a 4 star because the food was good, however its a chain restaurant and the server was late at refiling our drinks and refilling the bread.  We had a very enjoyable night at cheesecake factory. They liked the atmosphere and the food was great!!"
B H.,"CANYON CNTRY, CA",0,28,,1.0,3/16/2014,We've given this chain 3 times and ever time we are disappointed With the quality of the food and extremely overpriced even for the cheesecake. Food was terrible cheesecake nothing to rave about and it was pretty dirty even our napkins. Will never come back.
Vanessa M.,"South Pasadena, CA",0,24,5,5.0,7/29/2015,Three words: lemon meringue cheesecake. It was absolutely amazing- and half off too because of the national cheesecake day special. Service was good. The dining area was practically empty (it was around 1020p when we arrived)
Nick R.,"Pasadena, Los Angeles, CA",2,14,,1.0,2/24/2014,"Absolutely terrible service today. I called at 11:20am to make a to go order. The girl at the front desk tried to tell me they didn't open until 11:30am, when I know for a fact they open at 11:00am as I go there all the time and the posted hours say the same. She then said the order couldn't event be placed at the time as the bakery computer wasn't turned on and I should call back at 11:30.  I then walked by the restaurant and saw people eating inside. Really??? Thankfully Louise's is across the street and has better service.  #GoHomeCheesecakeFactoryYoureDrunk"
Janet G.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",0,8,1,1.0,12/22/2015,"Was there last night and the service was terrible. After bringing me a tiny piece of fish on my taco, I called the manager over and she had such a bad attitude. The piece of fish was the the size of my pinky and about two inches long and she made it seem like it was my fault. I've eaten at Cheesecake for years- never have I experienced this."
Maggie C.,"Los Angeles, CA",3683,2700,11555,3.0,8/5/2011,"I had a special auntie-niece lunch date.  We went to Cheesecake Factory because my niece wanted cheesecake. We ordered raspberry lemonade, fish and chips (for me) and Renee special (for sweet niece) and mango keylime cheesecake. The raspberry lemonade was nice and refreshing with sugar coated glass rim.  I didn't see my favorite complimentary brown bread so I asked for it.  The waitress got me fresh new ones from the oven.  Yumm.. Fish and chips: it came with coleslaw and fries.  My fries were not greasy and tartar sauce was good.  The fish was just ok. Renee special: turkey sandwich and mushroom soup.  My niece enjoyed both and she said that the turkey was ""FRESH"".  She didn't like the salad. We took the cheesecake home and ate it at night.  The waitress claimed that it was new and she liked it very much.  We didn't really like it. Great and prompt service. 3 stars!! The Cheesecake Factory is kinda yummylicious!!"
Michael R.,"Cerritos, CA",396,87,28,4.0,5/10/2015,Came here with dad for mothers day after orchestra after scouting around what to eat at old town pasadena. After seeing all these tricked out bentleys and rolls royce. I was so hungry i got the 4 cheese after munchin in asian lettuce wrap and some good salad. Dad got a steak and salmon to go. What a good night :)
Kristine C.,"San Marino, CA",7,13,3,5.0,9/22/2015,I absolutely love their fried zucchini! The portabello fries and fried avocados are also mixed in this great big bundle of happiness!! This is so far my most fairies dish. I am very glad the made it :) thank you so much!
Ken R.,"Pasadena, CA",43,17,,2.0,4/9/2016,"Went to this Location on Wednesday nite....They put us at a small table next to the window though....I' d rather have a larger table as Im 6'3""...A pair of ladies came in and wanted a larger table too in the middle and the hostess was rude to them in my opinion....Guess its a mgt thing....I suppose Ill return to the Arcadia location for my next visit....."
Jaime T.,"Rialto, CA",71,15,14,2.0,1/27/2015,I came on Sunday Evening the weight wasn't long. But as for the food it was nothing to write home about. Our waitress forgot about us of took her 20 minutes to take our order. We finally received the food it was Luke warm nothing was hot. My friend order chicken lettuce wraps that was not worth the price. They gave little pieces of romaine lettuce instead of big butter lettuce. My other friend order jumbalaya pasta also luke warm the presentation did not look nice and the pasta was a big ball of noodles with a bunch of cayenne pepper all over the plate and food. The waitress went around offering every table around us Parmesan cheese and did not offer my friend any with his meal. The prices are to high to just serve ok food. The quality of cheesecake factory is a lot different now.I think I would only come back for dessert I was not happy with my dining experience.
Dora B.,"Pasadena, CA",6,36,60,3.0,7/4/2015,"Food is great if you're not counting carbs. Everything has carbs!!!  Their menu is extent, but not great if you're counting carbs! I think they should include items in their menu that are low in carbs. I'd come more often. Other than that, it will be a while before I come back. It's all about the carbs, carbs, carbs."
Joyee C.,"Monterey Park, CA",61,264,616,4.0,6/28/2014,"I like this place, with nice view on the shopping street!  You can relax from the busy day!  I get to have a free loaf of the wheat brown bread every time i leave hehe..."
