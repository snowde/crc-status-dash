Stefany G.,"West Covina, CA",0,1,,1.0,5/23/2016,Last night i went to dinner with My friend at the Cheesecake Factory in Pasadena it was probably the most disappointing dinner i've had. It took about 25 minutes to get our first round of drinks then it took over an HOUR to get our dinner which was just PASTA and the restaurant was slow. When the food FINALLY came out they brought out her food WRONG. We were just over it and didn't even want our food anymore. They offered us dessert and the specific cheesecakes that we ordered they had run out of smh. First and LAST time we go there.
Joseph I.,"Los Angeles, CA",136,6,1,5.0,6/22/2015,"I came to this location with my mother. Our waiter was probably the best we have ever had. When coming ask to sit in Joshua's section! He'll take care of you. He was very friendly, polite, and attentive. When I ordered a drink he noticed my birthday recently passed and he brought me a cheesecake with a candle and everything! Great job, Joshua! You made me feel very special."
Jenny K.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",19,64,78,5.0,6/20/2015,"Had a party o f 21 during lunch hour. Service was great. Fast. No super long waiting for food. Bread was served right away. Food was delicious. I had the lunch special....can't remember the name of it. Came with soup, salad, AND sandwich! It was a lot of food for me and everything was fresh! Love their homemade calm chowder! Only hard part was finding parking. Even the structure across the street was packed!"
Chris H.,"Lancaster, CA",72,20,,4.0,1/25/2015,"I wanted to give thanks and acknowledge Adrion Smart--in my opinion one of the best servers I have experienced at The Cheesecake Factory.  Although we had some challenges with our food, due to the kitchen and not Adrion.  He continued to try and correct the problems to our satisfaction.  He went above and beyond to make it right and we probably would not be coming back if it was not for Adrion.  His attentiveness, care, concern and dedication to WOW-ing the customer is a testament to his character and commitment to deliver a memorable experience.  Thank you Adrion for caring and making a difference.  If you are in the area and dine with TCF--ask for Adrion!"
Jenelle B.,"Encino, Los Angeles, CA",1176,806,712,5.0,8/11/2011,"YUMMMMMM mmmmHHHMMM.... There is so much goodness to speak of when thinking of The Cheesecake Factory. I went here specifically for the cheesecake and man I wasn't disappointed. I had the Dulce de Leche cheesecake and it was the moist-est (i hate using that word), most fluffy, and textured cheesecake I had in while. The graham cracker crust perfectly complemented the cake so I i fell deeply in love with my cake/pie/ (idk if cheesecake is really a cake or considered a pie ??)   I was contemplating giving this place 4 rather that 5 stars but the mimosa I had here just tipped the scale. It was just amazing. Sweet, Minty and strong. The perfect combo for a drink. And the mint leaf was pretty I  wanted to put it in my hair :X"
Margaret L.,"San Gabriel, CA",552,946,1196,3.0,5/16/2012,"I love the brown bread that they give you when you sit down, it has a slight sweetness to it and because it is brown I like to think it is healthy. Avocado Egg Rolls - these are really good but totally fattening, but they are great for sharing Chinese Chicken Salad - the salads here are ridiculously huge, but it is pretty good and definitely very filling if you can even manage to finish it Chicken Marsala with Mushrooms - this is my favorite dish at Cheesecake Factory, I love the combinations of the marsala sauce and the chicken, I could probably do without the cheese that is on the chicken but it the flavor is fantastic, and of course the giant heaps of mashed potatoes are always welcomed since my grandma loves to steal them off my plate Cajun Jambalaya Pasta - I am always in search for great pasta, and this is their most popular pasta dish, but I found it to be really dry, the flavor is nice but the dryness made me really thirsty My family loves the White Chocolate Raspberry Cheesecake (I am not a cheesecake fan since I find it to be too rich) and always asks for extra raspberry sauce on the side. The one thing I don't understand, is how they don't take reservations. It seems kind of ridiculous but if you have to deal with a long wait, Old Town is not a bad place to do it, just put your name down and go shopping."
Chris S.,"Chatsworth, CA",255,1601,6242,4.0,1/9/2014,"This is your typical Cheesecake Factory. When you order food it's going to be consistent with all the other stores in the chain and the service is going to be good. We ordered prime rib and a Mexican salad and it came exactly how we expected.  I was impressed with the service here, especially considering we arrived an hour after the BCS Championship ended and the place was slammed. The staff was prepared and ready for a barrage of people - and they handled it well and maintained excellent service. Nice job management."
M W.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,92,147,3.0,3/27/2016,"I have been to this location a few times. I've also been to the one at Westfield Arcadia and the Americana. This to me is the least crowded location. Plus they have been the most consistent with food and drinks. Point and case. I've order the vegan salad and the Georgia peach from all locations. At the Americana I was only provided one type of dressing for my salad, the second time.I met friends there I was given 2. At Westfield Arcadia I asked how many dressings am I getting with this salad and the waitress told me 3.  But Pasadena they have always consistently given me 2. Not a huge deal except when I got three ot sure tasted like i got double dressing of the same kind. On to my drink. I have to say I do love Grey Goose mainly because I don't get hangovers from drinking it. I'm a lightweight to begin with so one good drink is all I need to be feeling no pain. Well you would hope that when you ask for Grey Goose you would get it. Didn't happen for sure at the Americana but was told it was but my bill didn't reflect it.... worse yet I had a hangover the next day. Besides being consistent with the above mentioned this location has been pretty consistent with other food items like their bang bang shrimp and chicken, providing a bread basket, their chicken and biscuits, stuffed mushrooms, crab cakes, Madera chicken and of course their desserts. So by choice, this is the location I would choose to go to if I had to go to a Cheesecake Factory. Not a bad locations since it's in Old town Pasadena. You have a lot of other spots to eat around there so don't think the Cheesecake Factory is the only good eats you're going to stumble upon!"
Crazy Deer C.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,3,,4.0,7/27/2015,"I came in today for a slice of Key Lime Cheesecake to go. The $8 something price was a bit much but the cheesecake was as good as I remember. Service was speedy and the staff up front were friendly and kind. So, if you are ever in the mood for Key Lime Cheesecake in Old Town Pasadena swing by. I only wish their slices were a bit bigger considering the price. Oralé Namasté."
Julie D.,"Pasadena, CA",144,654,49,3.0,4/26/2012,"Came here with a group of co-workers recently, and the service was pretty slow and spottingly inattentive at times.  They didn't give us bread for the longest time. I ordered a ""skinnylicious"" Asian chicken salad (hold the chicken).  I don't like when I see these gimmicky names for ""weight-loss"" foods, but my choices are limited here with my food intolerances/particulars, so I went with it.  The salad had good flavor, and the lunch portion is not as big as the dinner one, so it wasn't crazy large.  Still, I had enough to take home for another meal. Overall, I know why this place is popular, and I would come back again.  Their menu is huge, and the cheesecakes are huge and look divine."
Jurissa D.,"Baldwin Park, CA",12,32,2,5.0,4/4/2015,My experience here is always great . I had the perfect date night. Shout out to our server Shannon who was the sweetest ! :)
Rhonald N.,"Glendale, CA",177,271,1618,5.0,3/29/2014,"Cheesecake is awesome for desert and dinner to if you want to do everything there.  My friend I ate at a nearby restaurant in Old Town Pasadena and wanting something decadent and sweet, Cheesecake Factory was the answer.  The Old Town Pasadena location can get crowded at times especially on weekends but the wait is worth the wait."
Alice A.,"Granada Hills, CA",539,143,31,3.0,10/4/2013,"Came here for dinner with a friend as he had been wanting to come because he is a huge fan of The Big Bang Theory.  The hosts and waitress that assisted us were very personable, friendly and on top of their game. The three star was for the food.... The chef's need some guidance because my tostada salad lacked chicken and I felt like I was on a scavenger hunt for it... no bueno... I explained this to the waitress and she removed it from the table, offered if I would like to order something else but at that point my hunger was over.. She was very kind to inform the manager and it was removed from the bill.... I would return in hopes for a better meal experience... 5 star for the customer service though!"
Tammy R.,"Glendora, CA",0,21,,2.0,8/24/2013,"It was a Saturday afternoon. The wait wasn't bad at all, I ordered the meatloaf which is always good, my friend ordered from the ""new"" menu, a single page of items not on the regular (very extensive menu) It was described as  a steak sandwich on a  roll with caramelized onions (some other stuff) and au jus-  My friend asked for the onions on the side and when the meal finally arrived, the waiter told us ""Sorry, we can't put the onions on the side, until Monday, it has to go out just EXACTLY as it is described"" well, it would have been nice if he had told us that when we ordered it instead of when he served it- Our drink order took over 20 minutes to get to our table, and we barely got it before our meal..Additionally, the bread was beyond ""Crusty"" it had a crust like concrete, but  of course there was the au jus to dip it in.. well, except for the fact that the au jus was served in a teacup, whose diameter was about 2 inches smaller than the sandwich, so you could not even dip it into the au jus... Not a very successful menu item, and please, Juan, when your customer orders something (like onions on the side) and you cannot do it, please let them know BEFORE you present them with the dish- It could be that they have an allergy !"
Michelle M.,"Burbank, Los Angeles, CA",48,25,17,1.0,10/17/2014,"Worst experience. The bread was burned, the butter was curdled, wait staff slow and inefficient. The server got one of our orders wrong and we had to wait a long time and there was no apology. The apathetic server also had a bad attitude. Not up to Cheesecake Factory standards."
Alison E.,"Santa Monica, CA",0,2,,1.0,10/24/2016,"I would give negative stars if I could.  I went there for a birthday dinner on Oct 22, 2016 and the experience was awful.  I don't mind waiting for my table if it is crowded, but after ordering, we waited 40 minutes for our meals, which were all terrible.  Overcooked hamburgers (when two were requested medium-rare), charred hamburger buns, overcooked pasta, and a MIA waitress.  Neither the manager nor waitress offered us more bread, or a complimentary appetizer for our extended wait time. When we got the manager over a second time and told her all that had gone wrong, all she could say was basically ""we're really busy right now"" and ""what would you like me to do"".  When we said they should comp us our meals given the horrible service and food, she had the audacity to say she couldn't do that because she hadn't seen two of the meals.  So they made us pay for two of our four meals despite them all being terrible. We ended up at El Pollo Loco to actually get some decent food afterwards.  Absolutely HORRIBLE experience at a restaurant brand that I have usually liked in the past.  I will never go back to the Pasadena Cheesecake Factory."
Tiffany T.,"Manhattan, NY",68,4,,1.0,1/2/2016,They don't take reservations. 1.5+ hrs for mediocre American food.... It is not worth ur time.
Dee W.,"Paramount, CA",227,368,146,4.0,3/15/2012,"FINALLY popped my Cheesecake Factory cherry....our Waiter was wonderful, fast & friendly oh & honest...we asked his opinion on Sweet Potato Fries & he said, ""i've had better, but they're good"" so, we passed on them. But I tried the Macaroni Cheese Burger (burger topped with Mac & Cheese thats breaded & fried & then topped with cheese sauce) I LOVED IT!!!! We managed to save room for dessert & got the Reese's Peanut Butter Chocolate Cheesecake, simply put....its AMAZING!!!!  P.S. 1 star is missing for the rude bitch who took over our table when our waiter went to lunch!!!!"
Jordan C.,"Arcadia, CA",0,20,,1.0,3/26/2016,"The cheese cake and milk shake we ordered was delicious , but the service here is horrible ! Took over 15 minutes to get a cocktail. I don't know if this establishment is understaffed , which would explain why the service was slow and the waitress attitude unwelcoming . Typical service I guess at these commercial type restaurants..."
Regina W.,"Los Angeles, CA",124,780,2001,2.0,2/1/2014,"I recently got take out from here and ordered the chile relleno burger (medium). I tried this at the Santa Anita location and loved it. The person who rang me up was super friendly but it did take about 20 minutes since it was a busy Friday night. When I tried it, it was nothing like the one in Arcadia. The patty was overcooked, almost char and dry as heck. The bun and other ingredients were decent and about the same as the last time I had it but there was less tomato sauce. I could of really used the tomato sauce cause of the dry patty. I'll definitely go to another location to try this burger again."
