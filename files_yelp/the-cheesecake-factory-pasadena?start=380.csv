Lindsey L.,"Los Angeles, CA",34,49,27,4.0,10/14/2014,"Love the location of this restaurant. Right in the middle of Old Town at Fair Oaks and Colorado. Whenever I come here I always like requesting the seat along Colorado Ave.  Great area to sit if you like to people watch. Last time I was here I tried their turkey burger on their healthy menu. Since I was going to indulge in some heavy cheesecake later, I decided to go healthier for dinner. Surprising the burger was pretty tasty. Every bite was juicy and full of flavor. Finished the whole thing! Would definitely order this again. For dessert I had their amazing Godiva Cheesecake!! Always a must! I left completely satisfied. Service was great. Never had a bad experience here. They are pretty strict with carding so do not forget your ID at home like my friend! She unfortunately could not order a drink all night. On weekends be prepared for long waits. No reservations. Just walk ins."
Jenny L.,"Sunland-Tujunga, CA",4,12,,2.0,10/29/2014,"Our food was awesome! Came out hot and very delicious!! The reason for the 2 stars, we had the worse waiter in the world. Forgot our order multiple times, had to back to table to be reminded what wet ordered. Got our dessert order wrong, by then we just wanted to leave and took what was served to us."
Sukhraj B.,"Orange, CA",1723,1189,1870,2.0,3/25/2011,I've never really had an issue with Cheesecake Factory except for the long lines and the menu. Why does every restaurant have a long line? Is the food really that good? And what's up with the menu? So many freakin' choices. It takes me forever to decide what I want because it's like 23 pages.  OK enough with my rambling. We came here for a late happy hour after the book signing at Vroman's and discovering El Portal (our original plans) was closed early. Bummer. The appetizers we got were so-so. The taquitos were actually OK but the avocado eggrolls were cold; the drinks however were pretty good so at the end of the night I was just happy to spend time with friends vs the subpar food. Oh well. At least there was a parking structure nearby that made things a bit convenient.  And what's up with seating families with kids at the bar area? We couldn't engage in conversation like we wanted to because we had to be sensititve to the family. Boo.
Jocelyn V.,"Monterey Park, CA",318,621,337,4.0,6/6/2013,"The Cheesecake Factory is a standard restaurant with many varieties of food. I feel like I come here only if we can't decide on a place to eat. Given the many options to choose from why not?  I recently was introduced to the Chicken Bellagio and I think I'm going to be coming to Cheesecake more often. This is the best dish that I've had at Cheesecake. Yes, they have the farfalle pasta, jambalaya, pizza, sandwiches, tacos, etc, etc.... but damn why was I so late to try the Chicken Bellagio? Well anyways, you have two slabs of breaded chicken breast topped with proscuitto and arugula served with basil pasta. Huge portions, enough for two, and my this is an excellent dish. I'm impressed Cheesecake! Usually Cheesecake Factory is crowded, the lines out the door. I found an easier way. Just go to the self-seating bar area. You still get the same dine-in experience. You have alcohol right in front plus TVs. Good option if it is just two or one. -Give it a try! P.s.: service was excellent!"
Gail S.,"Lompoc, CA",14,38,32,3.0,12/19/2014,Food was very good. We were seated quickly.  Only negative  was our server. Apparently she snaked a table from the other  server and they were arguing about next to our table.  VERY UNPROFESSIONAL!  And she was short with us and very inattentive. .
Bobby Y.,"Cleveland, OH",61,469,2098,3.0,12/30/2011,"Look, you know what you're getting with the Cheesecake Factory. Generally decent service, so-so food, and some decent sweets. Walked in at 12:10pm during a recent lunch rush.  I lucked out on parking and they were able to immediately seat me, despite every other restaurant in the area turning me away. Service and food were decent, and they kept the drink refills coming.  I grabbed cheesecake for carryout and loved that it was at the perfect temperature.  It was still cold enough that the cheesecake was all in one solid piece and not soupy and draining away. A-Ok for this place."
Carol U.,"Los Angeles, CA",83,2,4,1.0,11/19/2015,"So last night, my sister in law and I decide to go to Cheesecake Factory, since we had the kids with us. And they had kids menu.  First of all service was horrible. Slow and not friendly.  We sat without menus, we kept on trying to call a server, to bring us the menus, since the kids were starving.  It took a long time for the server to come, and then from the hostess to bring us the menu.  P.s. I also to go food to my husband.  Today, I wasn't feeling good. And texted my sister in law. Found out she also had the same symptoms I had. A bit odd. But not odd since, my husband also is facing the same symptoms!  My sister in law called the establishment, talked to the manager Tamra...  To find out if the food was expired, or maybe if the food got contamined. No apologies, or questions asked. The only thing she did was get her info, and right after hang up.  As a huge restaurant chain like CF I would think they put more attention when hiring managers, not random people that lacks any kind professionalism, and responsibility towards customers.  -0 stars"
Connie B.,"Camarillo, CA",0,4,,5.0,6/19/2015,"Had the best time celebrating my best friends birthday with Catherine of the Sea, Vanessa with a V, and PJ of the stars. And they made me feel like a superstar  . Thanks again! Best Ice cream ever!!!!"
Kelly S.,"Los Angeles, CA",64,89,147,4.0,7/23/2011,"Fast service, short wait (on a Saturday afternoon), nice waitresses, roomy and large location. I give it four stars instead of five because they don't validate parking structure tickets As an overall mention, their brunch is NOT GOOD. I had a combination of four different things and they were all bad. :) El torito's is better."
Mike M.,"Sunland, CA",242,380,231,3.0,12/5/2013,"There's nothing wrong with the Cheesecake Factory.  The food is fine, the service is good, parking in adjacent lots isn't too bad.  It's just not my favorite place in the world.  That being said, I tried a sample of the Peppermint Bark cheesecake, and that almost got them an extra star - phenomenal!  I had the mac & cheese burger, and I had no complaints, but it wasn't as exciting as I was hoping."
Dalena D.,"Burbank, CA",415,338,20,5.0,8/3/2014,Wait time is not long if you go during non-peak hours.  The service is fine and can be awesome depending on who you get as your server.  Their pastas are good but are really greasy and oily so you can get sick of your plate really quick.  Good menu though.
Cheryl V.,"Los Angeles, CA",157,192,,3.0,4/5/2013,"If you go to a Cheesecake Factory, there is a certain standard level you expect the restaurant to meet in terms of decor, food, and service.  I would have to applaud this particular CF location because they get just about everything right, and there's nothing different about my latest experience here than any of my other visits to the many CF locations I've been to, both in SoCal and elsewhere. This place is great when you're just not very picky and are hungry and maybe have some friends or family with you.  Their extensive menu with satiate any appetite (as long as it's a big one), and they have some pretty decor inside.  The waiters all wear white and long aprons -- something out of a culinary school, it would seem like.  The food is pretty much the same if you order the same few plates every time (like I do) and can compare between locations. One thing that did irk me a bit is that at dinner last night, I had ordered a split bubbly with two glasses -- my husband and I are closing escrow on a house and wanted to celebrate -- and after ten minutes, our waitress came by to inform us that they pulled the bottles out of storage and that they ""can put it over ice for us, or did I want it at room temperature?""  Room temperature?  Really?  Has anyone ever requested sparkling at room temp?  A very, very odd inquiry.  I ended up cancelling the bubbly (even if over ice, it would take a little bit longer, and we were both dead tired by that point) and ordering a glass of white wine instead. When we had finished dinner and needed our check, it was a bit difficult to flag our waiter down.  And, when the check was brought to us, the bubbly was still left on the bill, so we had to ask to have it removed. All in all, an okay experience, one that I would expect from a CF.  But last night was a bit frustrating, which shouldn't happen on a night we wanted to celebrate."
Fonda K.,"Rosemead, CA",60,248,55,4.0,8/19/2014,Service in the bar area was awesome.  Our server was friendly and gave great recommendations.  The mojito I ordered was nice and strong.
Leticia B.,"South Gate, CA",1,5,3,5.0,4/8/2015,Both service and food were 5 stars tonight !!! Thank you nicki ( best server since I've been coming here ) kudos to the chef ! Ordered the  bang bang chicken and shrimp  along with Chinese chicken salad !! So delish!!!!!
Yvonne R.,"Mesa, AZ",86,32,35,5.0,4/4/2015,Crispy Cuban rolls from a deep fryer in the kitchen of heaven. I order them with some serano chilies to make the AMAZING.
JP A.,"Glendale, CA",70,329,37,5.0,1/4/2014,"A Friday night on Colorado and NO wait? Especially on the weekend before the Rose Parade? Is this possible? Yes, it was. We were seated immediately after drooling over the cheesecakes and debating whether to sit and get cheesecake. Too bad that the birthday cheesecakes weren't free. :( Can't have everything... It was quite amusing to watch Pasadena's finest catch sucker after sucker."
Cindy G.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,39,,5.0,5/26/2015,"Had lunch yesterday and as usual it was a good experience, we were  fortunate to have Kimmie as our server. Being in a position to be the face of the establishment could be the worst responsibility ever! And then there's Kimmie she was so pleasant, smiled, and friendly! Hopefully when we return she will still be there."
Tim Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",74,198,36,4.0,1/1/2014,Covenient to-go parking in the fair oaks parking lot (Schoolhouse) on Colorado/Fair Oaks They do a good job of fulfilling special requests Food is consistent and tasty and now they have GF and skinny options
James S.,"Los Angeles, CA",561,1194,627,3.0,11/13/2013,I've been here once before a long long time ago to dine in but this time around I ordered for to go. The Asian wrap is not bad. The cheesecakes will induce a diabetic coma. The sweet corn tamales are surprisingly tasty. The lunch size dishes can be ordered 7 days a week Will I be back? Reluctantly yes. This is my brother's favorite restaurant. So when it comes to a free meal this not so bad of a place to get something pro bono
Jaime K.,"Santa Monica, CA",52,38,6,4.0,9/22/2014,Always like coming here to satisfy my cheesecake craving. They have a whole menu devoted to all different flavors of cheesecake. Always takes me a few minutes to decide because they all look so good!! My favorite is the banana cream or the Godiva ones. This location is conveniently located in the middle of old town near Colorado and Fair Oaks.  I always try to get a window seat along Colorado Ave. Great place to sit for people watching.
