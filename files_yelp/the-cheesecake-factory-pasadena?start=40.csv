Ryan S.,"Pasadena, CA",146,423,7,4.0,1/20/2017,"We visited Cheesecake Factory on Thursday, Jan 19th at about 8pm with a party of four people. This is a Cheesecake Factory with typical interior decor; however, it seemed a little bit smaller than many locations.   Our table began with an order of the chicken nachos.  For my entree, I personally had the Cobb Salad replacing the tomatoes with beets.  Both of these items were excellent.   For dessert, I shared a slice of the Hazlenut Cheesecake with one other person, and as always the cheesecake was absolutely delicious. The only reason for the slightly less than perfect rating is that the server we had for the first half of our dining experience clearly didn't want to be there and was just clearly not loving her job.   She identified herself as a replacement server filling in for someone who was on her dinner break.  Once our regular server returned, everything was quite nice again."
Will A.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,23,,4.0,11/30/2017,Consistently good food and always a really great staff. I love the variety in the menu. The place is always clean and the decor is great.
Michelle S.,"Los Angeles, CA",49,27,1,4.0,11/21/2017,"I was sooo sad that they ran out of bread when I came :( that's like 95% of the Cheesecake Factory experience.. Nbd. I ordered the mushroom marsala and it was OK. I felt like the mushrooms were heavily sauces, so it upset my stomach a little. We got free lemonades, the male manager was so sweet! Don't like eating to big restaurants like these but it's a really good place for a meal out."
Ben A.,"Arcadia, CA",4320,743,1968,4.0,12/17/2016,"After finding the One Colorado Santa had packed it in for the rainstorm the other day (lame, btw) we returned to the parking structure with three disappointed kids to discover a fender bender between a UPS truck and a small car had thoroughly blocked and destroyed traffic on Union St.  Since we weren't going anywhere for a while, and the kids were hungry anyway, we decided to walk down the street to Cheesecake Factory. For whatever reason I always seem to have a gift card or two for this restaurant (#educatorsFTW).  Walking into an old town Pasadena restaurant with three kids under eight on a Thursday night isn't my idea of a good time, but unlike some of the other competing places in the area, we were able to pull it off here.  Mrs. Picante and I ordered off the Skinnylicious menu: Greek salads and lettuce wrap tacos were both small, but satisfying.  The dipping sauces on the tacos were pretty salty, but tasty. 6 to 8 dollars a plate isn't a bad deal, even for appetizers. The kids had assorted fare of macaroni and cheese, quesadillas, and picking olives out of my salad.  Service was pretty good for a rainy night, and the kids were actually pretty well behaved.  Pro parent tip: this restaurant is plenty loud enough to cover the occasional whining, yelling, screaming, or other assorted noises that children make.   By the time everyone had eaten, the accident has cleared, and we were on our way. Still have to figure out how to get our Santa photographs with the kids taken, but at least we got out as a family on a traditional old town Pasadena date night, and didn't bother anyone else's good time... As far as we know."
Aleah W.,"Los Angeles, CA",45,60,16,2.0,7/14/2017,"I happened to have some time to kill and was hungry. I also had a gift card I figured I'd take advantage of.  First of all five stars for service. The bartender was really awesome. I forget her name but she was super friendly, knowledgeable and attentive. She was also really amazing at dealing with the dbag sitting at the bar being obnoxious towards her.  The food I wish I could give zero stars. There weren't near as many healthy options as I had hoped for. And the one salad that looked appealing, tuna tataki, was insanely overpriced at $19. Tender Greens doesn't even charge that much for their Tuna Niçoise salad.  I ordered the skinnyliscious veggie burger. It came with a side salad. The side salad was only lettuce and tasted like chemicals. I immediately spit it out. I proceeded to eat the burger. It was ok. I didn't have high expectations for a ""skinnylicious"" veggie burger at the Cheesecake Factory.  The issue was shortly after with the pains I felt in my stomach. I don't think I had full on food poisoning but there was something definitely not ok with the burger.  There are way better, healthier, and budget friendlier options in the area. I won't be returning."
Emily X.,"Oakland, CA",9,146,65,3.0,8/24/2017,"First off- the portions are HUGE. Way more than one person can eat in one sitting, so you should definitely share.  I was not impressed with the service. The wait to even get a table was well over 20 minutes, and after that we had to wait an additional 10 minutes for the waitress to take our order. After that we were given bread, which was kinda stale and old. And then we had to wait over 30 minutes for our food to actually come out.  VEGAN OPTIONS- a humongous vegan Cobb salad- almonds are phenomenal, avocado fantastic, solid salad. Make sure to mix it up. Superfoods salad- the grapes are the best part and the dressing is delicious.  Overall- I enjoy the food, but not the wait or service. We got simple meals that should not have taken as long as it did"
Briana N.,"Sunland, CA",2,49,5,1.0,11/12/2017,Called to get an approximate wait time for a party of 15. The girl who answered said she couldn't give me an estimate till we get there!? Are you kidding me? Not going to take a family here with hungry kids for you to tell me the wait time is 2hrs! What a joke.
Lisa D.,"Monterey Park, CA",237,90,281,4.0,8/1/2017,"I love the food at cheesecake factory, even though it is a little pricey here especially for dinner. We always order the avocado egg rolls! This time, we ordered Shrimp Alfredo and the Buffalo Chicken Strips. I do recommend the chicken strips, but it is not crispy. If it was a little more crispy then it would be better. The shrimp alfredo was okay, not as flavorful. We also got drinks and I believe I ordered the Strawberry Daiquiri and that was really good! I do not really like to taste the alcohol and it masked it very well! I highly recommend that drink! The service was good, but a little slow since there was a lot of people on a Friday night. So our food came out pretty slow as well. But the waiter did come to check up on us to let us know the food will be out soon."
Crystlhrt M.,"La Canada Flintridge, CA",33,42,7,2.0,5/22/2017,"I picked Cheesecake Factory for a milestone birthday dinner last night with friends. I'm really sad about my choice.  It started with trying to make a reservation for 6pm on Sunday. I was curtly told I needed to call  back for a same day reservation, advance reservations are not made for Saturday/Sunday. I called back on Sunday as directed - about 11:30am. I was then told they only take reservations during the first hour. When I asked the hostess on the phone where I could find that information (on the website, etc.), she was confused, then flustered, then, being asked again, she said she was new and didn't know.  We had a mix-up of some kind on being called to our table. The cell phone was rung, then we were sent back to the bar for another 10 minutes. We'd already closed our bar tab, I'm not sure what the mix-up was, since I was the birthday girl, I didn't get involved. I was just glad our spots were still available. Overall, our wait was just over the quoted 30-40 minutes.  After a very long delay (shorthanded???), our table-ordered cocktails arrived - after the hot appetizers and my martini included an eyelash or similar. (It didn't have mascara on it, so it didn't come from any of us.) The wait for drinks, including the replacement, was quite long and without explanation. The only drink our server was on top of, was coffee for one of us. A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT was that, even with the extensive menu, it was a challenge to find something for one of our group that has serious food allergies. No potatoes beyond french fries without dairy?!?!? We were told the smashed potatoes contained sour cream, and there is no baked potato option. Broccoli is great - but not exactly an indulgement.  The final straw was that at the end of our meal, we were approached by a previously-unseen employee, all in black, who abruptly asked ""Do you need something else?"" as though we were in the way. We were actually waiting for the additional ""To Go"" food one of us ordered as well as our packed up leftovers. Our actual server had nicely offered to keep them together in back until we were finished and ready to go. The employee was told why were waiting, he took off before we'd finished getting the words out and then returned and essentially through 8 bags of food at us. Talk about a sour taste being left. :(  That final exchange - his tacky, disrespectful approach to us after we spent close to $100 each, inspired this review. I sincerely doubt I'll return to this, or any other, Cheesecake Factory in the future. It makes me sad since I usually meet friends once every month or two at various ones near different friends."
Shelly S.,"Los Angeles, CA",282,32,3,2.0,11/1/2017,I got the lunch BBQ chicken chopped salad and it disappointed. The lettuce and onions were not fresh and seemed like they were sitting out for a while. I've had this same meal at other Cheesecake Factory's and the food was fresher and better.
BF S.,"Los Angeles, CA",9,119,43,3.0,8/12/2017,Food wise it's standard cheesecake fare which is not a complaint. Shared deep fried mac'n cheese which is always good. I had the southwest chicken sandwich which I would have again. I didn't care for the waitress she couldn't answer the simplest questions about things like parking.
Miguel A.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,2,5.0,6/17/2017,"I love their Chicken Picatta! But, I love their customer service more! My boyfriend accidentally left my wallet in the men's bathroom. One of their servers was kind enough to return it! Bless you sir! I'm sorry my boyfriend forgot to ask for your name. He forgets everything, even his girlfriend's wallet."
Arshen B.,"Glendale, CA",78,4,4,1.0,11/1/2017,for the first time I said okay they are busy or they are human everyone has a mistake but for second time I got a burger from this location and it was uncooked
Elisa Y.,"Rowland Heights, CA",77,71,8,3.0,7/17/2017,"We came here on a Sunday evening for dinner. To our surprise when we arrived there wasn't much of a wait. The hostess said 5-10 minute wait. It took a little longer as more people walked in and they were being seated before us, which we summed they made reservations. Then we ordered our food and wow, it took FOREVER. It was such a long wait for the food, we were getting so restless. When the food finally came out, it was just okay. I tried a new dish and although it said it was one of their top dishes, it was just okay."
Angela P.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,7,4,1.0,7/19/2017,"The terrible receptionist, the black girl who has the black curly hair got the worst attitude towards the customer.  She will ruin your appetite and ruin your rest of the day."
Deelisa M.,"Whittier, CA",14,16,21,5.0,6/13/2017,"I'm always pleased when I come here. I love the one in Santa Monica solely because of the balcony view.  However...  So, I always order the same thing when I come. The vegan Cobb salad. I'm always pleased when there is a vegan option and I believe there's a few other vegans options as well.  I love this place! Everything is always on point, from the food, to customer service, to their amazing delicious cheesecakes, so I've heard! I hope they add a vegan option cheesecake soon!"
Nikia J.,"Pasadena, CA",1,32,5,2.0,5/31/2017,"Came here last night after a few hours at the spa. It was my birthday so I decided to enjoy a nice meal at the cheesecake factory. We ordered the avocado egg rolls in Nashville hot chicken nuggets as appetizers.We had the flying gorilla blended drinks as well. After drinks and apps we were stuffed. We decided to take our entrées home to eat later. I ordered the Louisiana chicken pasta and my friend ordered the Neapolitan Pasta. Unfortunately, both of the pastas were dry, bland, and underwhelming.  The two stars is actually for the server. She was great... very attentive and super friendly. I love the Cheesecake Factory. Never been to this particular one and hope it was just a bad day for the pasta cook. I'll probably give this location another try."
Gina S.,"Pasadena, CA",4,119,6,1.0,5/24/2017,"My gosh!!!!  They have 4 hostesses and not one of them can seat a table. The restaurant is only half full and we still have to wait. I honestly think that they just want it to look like there's a line out the door. So disappointing. By the way, it's 8:30 at night on a Tuesday and we are starving. What a joke!!!!! Please take a moment to read the managements response to this post, that's what is wrong with this place. In order to get good service, or any service for that matter, you need to come in first thing in the morning or way after 8:30 at night for dinner. I'm still laughing. What a joke!!!!"
Hala Hana C.,"Los Angeles, CA",240,131,720,4.0,5/12/2016,Take advantage of the HH all their appetizers are very tasty + flavorful!! Got full off just HH appetizers made with great quality~ Fave/MUST TRY!! Avocado Egg Rolls That Lettuce Wraps Buffalo Blast Crab + artichoke Dip Tex Mex Eggrolls Fire Roasted Fresh Artichoke Fried Macaroni Cheese
Jennifer Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,5,6,1.0,6/6/2017,"I love Cheesecake Factory but this location sucks. My experience here at this Pasadena location did not even reach satisfactory level. I called in ahead to make a take out order and I was put on hold for 15 minutes. I hung up and tried again. This time I waited over 20 minutes and by that time I was already there so I go into the restaurant and they made me wait 5 minutes to take my order. While waiting the employees were yelling across the room when to clock out..what a pleasant experience that was. Finally I get my order 30 minutes later. I ordered a strawberry lemonade and they gave it to me in a kids size cup. I always go to the Brea location and they always give it to me in a large cup which was triple the size of that tiny cup I received. So I asked about it and she said they only give it in that cup. I did not pay $3 for a tiny drink so at this point I was so frustrated and hangry. I wasn't even in the mood to argue with them so I just left. I got back to my place and my chicken nachos was missing the chicken! There was only just a sprinkle of cheese on my nachos, not to mention she did not even add any silverware or asked if I wanted complimentary bread (Brea location always includes it). All I want to say is THIS LOCATION NEEDS TO IMPROVE."
