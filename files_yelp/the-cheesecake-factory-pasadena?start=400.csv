Annie Marie S.,"Paramount, CA",0,9,2,5.0,2/15/2016,"My girlfriend and I went for Valentine's Day yesterday knowing there might be a bit of a wait, when we checked in, we were told it would be 45-50 min, not too bad considering it was VDAY. As we were waiting , Josh from the bar area came to us and asked us if we would like to avoid the wait and just sit at the bar and have dinner there, I looked at my gf and she nodded ""yes"". He escorted us to the bar, and Katie was there to welcome us with a big smile and set up our area very cute with a table cloth and glasses. We ordered dinner and drinks and they both kept checking on us as a team. We had the best time! It was only my second time there so Josh asked me what I like, I said spicy food! Lol (I'm Mexican) he recommended the Jamaican black pepper spicy shrimp and rice, it also came with mango salad and plantains. They made our date fun. Josh and Katie make such a great team. I am definitely going back and will surely look to see if they're there. Thanks for an awesome Valentine's date night! Great food and great vibe."
E.m. H.,"Cudahy, CA",0,41,6,5.0,3/20/2015,"I really love coming here for their guacamole (yes, you read that correctly) and of course a piece of cheesecake. I was pleasantly surprised when the guacamole I ordered was super fresh, lightly spicy (which you can change) and citrusy!!! Service is whatever; but who cares! Lol... I love this snack!!!"
Stephanie L.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,6,,4.0,5/11/2015,"Awesome service , never disappoints ! Food okay , bread fantastic! Cheesecakes outstanding! Overall Pasadena you are my fav ! Americana or Pasadena ? PASADENA it is ! Great staff ! Great place keep it up !"
.Elisa. Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",2358,236,1052,4.0,6/29/2014,"i love cheesecake factory but this one is very commercial. its like in a shopping center. its like downtown but for rich people lol. it is surrounded by a lot of nice shops but there is no parking in the front or side. well at least most of the time because its meter parking. there is a parking garage but its like 2 or 3 blocks away. If you want to go for a romantic dinner i suggest another one because this one is more for everyone that is tired of walking blocks and blocks and shopping around. it gets packed but they are very fast in attending. when i walked in for my birthday i thought they were at least going to take 30 min because the waiting area was super packed. when i asked how long was the wait they said 3 min. i was a little critical about it, but in like 2 min they told us our table was ready. i was surprised. the food was great and the service as well. it was just really really packed. once we were seated they did take a while to take our order but we didn't mind since we didn't know what we wanted."
Jackline V.,"Norwalk, CA",12,6,,4.0,3/17/2014,"Saturday nights are BUSY! We decided to take the risk and get a table anyways; I really wanted the Orange Chicken! Our wait was 45 mins and we ordered immediately, I mean, if you've waited that long, you might as well know what you're going to order!  BEST ORANGE CHICKEN FROM ANY CHEESECAKE I HAVE EVER BEEN TO!  I also spilled my strawberry lemonade all over the table and the staff was very friendly and understanding! A manager cleaned up the mess and did not charge me for the extra refill! I can definitely appreciate good management and it should be recognized. At least the two people who took care of us (manager and waiter) were very friendly."
Kevin H.,"Woodland Hills, CA",154,46,,4.0,8/12/2013,"Cheesecake Factory is a fantastic chain which offers nearly unlimited options of food and drinks. Although the primary type of food is more American style they also have a variety of options from different spectrums.  Since the menu is over 20 pages long here are a few items which are great (from appetizers to desserts): Thai Lettuce Wraps, Factory Nachos, Factory Chopped Salad, Baja Chicken Tacos, Fish and Chips, Four Cheese Pasta, Steak Diane, Fresh Strawberry Cheesecake. This location is also very good. It is a decent size and is not very cramped. The service is also very good and if you need help when your waiter isn't there you can ask anyone. While I was here there was almost always someone walking by I could ask for whatever I needed."
Mary S.,"Van Nuys, CA",31,43,4,5.0,2/15/2011,"I HEART YOU CHEESECAKE FACTORY..... I am a very picky eater and I can always find something new on the menu to eat. I love the food, the setting and the staff. It does at time get really crowded in there but that only because their food is so wonderful and I always go back.... I have been to most if not all the locations within my area. I only wish they made the place a little bigger. Some of my favs off the menu are......Spicy Cashew Chicken, avocado rolls-loveee this, Hot Spinach and Cheese Dip, Crispy Chicken Costoletta,   Crusted Chicken Romano, Chinese Chicken Salad, and love the drink Georgia Peach........ I highly recommend everyone to go and at least try it out."
Danielle L.,"South Pasadena, CA",1,8,1,1.0,2/6/2016,Come here very often with clients and friends since I am a local. Tonight was the only night that I have been disappointed with my server. She threw out drinks and plates down and did not even say anything to us during our whole dining experience. Very disappointed and will not be coming to this restaurant anytime soon.
Christina C.,"Glendale, CA",0,24,3,1.0,2/16/2016,"Such a disappointment.... Our waitress was so rude. She was treating us like she was doing us a favor, lol.. Just because you're having a bad day doesn't mean you should ruin everyone else's day.  I lost my appetite and took my salad to go. Oh and when I asked for a box to go the attitude continued. She literally wanted us to get up and get everything ourselves."
Ariel B.,"Montebello, CA",40,5,2,4.0,7/20/2014,This is a different than most Cheesecake Factory as it is not in the mall and means parking is difficult to find. I love their four cheese pasta with margarita and chessecake for dessert. This is location can get fairly busy. But it is still better than wait-time at other locations.
Gerald W.,"Burbank, CA",21,157,23,1.0,7/21/2014,"Service was absolutely the worst, my friend ordered a salad that was about as dry as the desert we live in.  Our servers name was Christi and I can say she is one of the reasons I won't be coming back.  I think she stopped by our table a total of 3 times throughout the whole meal.  I won't say say that I won't be going to the cheesecake factory again, but It definitely won't be this one i go to."
Courtney A.,"Pasadena, CA",0,18,1,4.0,3/9/2015,I love this place..service has always been on point. The calamari is sooo good!! Great customer service! My waiter was very attentive and made sure I had everything I need.
Jesse P.,"Grovetown, GA",5,15,2,4.0,9/29/2014,"I came here in hopes that Penny or Bernadette would be working, but neither were. Other than that, everything was great!"
Dorothy L.,"Los Angeles, CA",849,422,753,5.0,9/7/2010,"For bakery take-out service only: I ordered a cheesecake last minute from this location, and the workers were more than helpful in accommodating my request. I called at 4:00 to have it picked up at 6:00. They defrosted it for me, so we could enjoy it after dinner. As for the tiramisu cheesecake... It was amazing. Buttery tiramisu! What could get better?! The Birthday Girl LOVED it, and that made it worth every penny ($25.95 for the 7"", to be exact). The vanilla bean cheesecake is the other favorite (although those are the only two I've had and loved)... I bet the rest are outstandingly delicious too!"
Alanna T.,"Camarillo, CA",0,1,,1.0,8/21/2016,"Do not go here! We were a party of 4. Ordered two of the beef dips, a pizza and the spaghetti and meatballs. The pizza took 30min to come out and when it did it was completely burned. The beef dip sauce was super salty... Seemed like some soy sauce was poured into a saucer and served with the sandwich. We had the manager come out 2 times to fix these issues. Then, our friend bit into a meatball... Completely raw on the inside! Again, the manager was brought out. When the bill came we expected to have all the food taken off since it was such a horrible experience for all 4 of us, but they refused to take the burned pizza off because the manager said ""it's supposed to be like that."" We agreed to pay for the drinks but were adamant about not paying for any of the horrible food... Needless to say it was the worst Cheese Cake Factory experience I've ever had, and normally at other locations the food is excellent. Beyond the food issues, the incompetency of the management and being full of excuses and not acknowledging the issues is what made this an even worse experience."
Keila N.,"Beverly Hills, CA",5000,2051,11264,4.0,7/31/2012,"The Cheesecake Factory is a well oiled machinery that serves corporate approved food.  My daughter likes to go here.  She usually orders the rib eye bloody.  I order the arugula salad, which is the best arugula salad by far. The cheesecakes are huge!  And yes, they are very good."
E G.,"Chino Hills, CA",6,48,17,2.0,11/20/2015,"Just when I had a good streak.... ok I have good reasons for this particular one. Just to be clear, I actually like cheesecake factory. For a chain restaurant it's pretty good. Food, drinks, service are decent and I do have a special place in my heart for this chain. I would be giving the cheesecake factories I've been to at least 4 stars.... just not this location. Here's why.  Food. The taste of everything overall wasn't as good as the others. Example, I ordered the ribeye with fries, the steak itself was cooked to my liking, so bonus points. But it was too salty, and I do have a salty pallet and don't mind salty things. But in this case it was too salty, and you know it is when a guy who likes salty things says so. When I got the fries, I actually in my mind, and verbally, said ""noooooo."" Like Luke Skywalker finding out Vader is his father nooo. Because the fries changed. Not sure if it's this location, or they changed everywhere, but the fries are no longer skinny and crispy. They are the fat fries that everyone serves. Not that I have anything against fat fries, they are still good, but the skinny fries are what made them unique because not many places have them. It sounds like a personal gripe, but I wouldn't have mind if they tasted good.... not really. They tasted they've been sitting under the heat lamp for a while.  They gave me a couple onion rings with it, which was nice, but most of it was batter. How much, like a legit inch of it. If you like that kind of thing, hey go it, but i like tasting some of my onion in my onion rings. If there is too much batter it's not balanced and the flavor is too overpowering. Also one other minor gripe on food, depending if you want to view this as one or not, the the ketchup taste like one of those knock off want to be ketsup. You know when Mr. Burns was at the grocery store and couldn't pick between the two bottles... yeah it was like that. It could be home made, idk, but if it is.... it needs work. With that being said, I would have given this a 3 star if it weren't for 1 other factor.... the service. I read other reviews and yes service here sucks. The waiters and waitresses were nice don't get me wrong, but they sucked on everything else. They checked up on us once after our food came out, and only because we looked depressed and upset. Because of that we didn't get refills on drinks, extra sauces we wanted, extra plates, etc. I think the manager checked up on us also, but also only because we had our heads down and looked disapointed. I was gonna say because we came during closing time, so I would understand if they wanted to pack up or they were just tired. But after seeing what other people said.... yeah it's not just me.  Again, I actually like this chain, but this one really needs work. I'm willing to give it another shot in the future, just be aware this wouldn't be my first pick as of now. With being in downtown pasadena surrounded by other good places, it's really hard to pick this place if i know i can get better on food and service. 2 stars."
Beth B.,"Newbury Park, CA",0,4,,5.0,4/4/2015,The Cheesecake Factory is good it has good cakes cool right they even have good food.And the walls are great even the silverware is good cool right I like the place is big.
Chris G.,"Los Angeles, CA",252,72,598,4.0,6/16/2014,"Father's Day is always going to be a day with crowds of people flocking to restaurants to eat, and yesterday was exactly that. Crowded. Pasadena is a great place with lots of different people coming to shop and eat and The Cheesecake Factory is smack dab in the middle of all the activity. The wait was about 30 minutes for our party of 6. Once the hostess sat us our server Sunny came over to greet us and describe the menu and bring us some of that warm bread and butter! Once we ordered the food came out shortly there after! I ordered the chicken and biscuits with mashed potatoes and broccoli and I must say this was quite good! The biscuit was warm and soft on the inside and slightly crunchy in the outside. The potatoes were flavorful and the broccoli was perfectly steamed. The chicken needed a bit of salt for my taste buds but was still a good eat. I sampled my girlfriends chicken enchiladas and her fathers fried shrimp and they were both very good! We got a triple chocolate cake to go and omg was it great! All in all I will be back!"
Rachel A.,"Los Angeles, CA",7,13,,5.0,2/11/2016,"My go-to place to hang out with friends, both local and visiting! I always get the BBQ Smokehouse burger and it's always juicy and perfectly cooked! Would definitely recommend!"
