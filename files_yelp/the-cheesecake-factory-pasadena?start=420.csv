Ty D.,"Redondo Beach, CA",572,556,141,4.0,7/5/2010,"I must admit that I'm not a big fan of the Cheesecake Factory.  The menu is just insanely way too much variety for me and the portions are way too humongous for me.  And I must admit, cheesecake is probably my least favorite dessert along with flan. This past Friday I decided to take my Mom to lunch and the Norton Simon museum and since The Cheesecake Factory was on the way to the museum on Colorado, I decided to bring Mom here for lunch. We were seated by our friendly hostess right away since we were early enough to avoid the lunch hour rush.  Our waiter was also very friendly explaining the specials of the day and bringing to the table freshly baked, sliced and warm squaw and sourdough loaves. Mom decided on a half sandwich (which she opted for the turkey), soup (which was clam chowder which was the d'jour for the day) and salad, and I ordered a lunch portion of the cabo (?) salad. Service was fast and very friendly.    Mom wasn't a big clam chowder fan but thought her soup was good.  Her salad was just way too big for her to even make a dint out of it.  And she ate about half of her half turkey sandwich.  She thought the french baguette roll that her sandwich was on was a bit tough for her to chew...although that maybe due to the age factor (to be polite to Mom). My salad was good and also huge.  I'm glad I got the lunch size portion.  My salad had corn, black beans, romaine lettuce, red onions, diced chicken breast, tomato slices tossed in a chipotle dressing and topped with corn tortilla strips.  It was good, although for my taste I thought they over did it with the dressing. Our service was very attentive and friendly.  Our waiter made sure that our lemonade and Arnold Palmer's were filled throughout our lunch.  We were way too stuffed for dessert.  Which is always the case when coming here."
Nick D.,"Pasadena, Los Angeles, CA",0,14,,5.0,2/11/2015,"After last weeks disgusting display of salmon at Celestinos italian restaurant on Lake Ave in Pasadena, I was apprehensive about ordering it here at the Cheesecake Factory. Well, let me tell you, the 'chef' from Celestinos should come here to learn a thing or two. My grilled salmon was marvelous, as was the steamed broccoli and mashed potatoes that accompanied it. I will definitely be coming back and I'm so pleased to have found something so delicious at a restaurant I thought I would never like."
Jessica R.,"Peoria, AZ",0,11,1,4.0,8/26/2014,We had great service by our waitress November. She kept checking in with us and we received our food quickly. We would definitely come back again.
Marlon M.,"San Gabriel, CA",26,65,31,5.0,9/30/2014,"Honestly, the Cheesecake Factory in Pasadena is by far the best one I've been to. Always fresh food that tastes great and the service is consistently on point. Always love coming here."
Homaira A.,"Pomona, CA",0,15,10,5.0,12/25/2014,"I've gone there many times and haven't ever been disappointed!! The food is amazing, my plate in particular is the shrimp and chicken jambalaya. It is amazing and has my other friends jealous they didn't get it! The seating time is awesome and the service there is quality!"
Chris H.,"San Francisco, CA",2,556,,3.0,12/14/2015,"Luau salad was not as good as it used to be, I was disappointed.  It was just ok.  It used to be a favorite.  The salmon was good, substituted rice for mashed potatoes.  It is very loud in this restaurant and we found it hard to converse.  Service was good.  Their portions are large but the quality of the food is just so-so, and somewhat bland."
Jenna P.,"Altadena, CA",120,108,18,4.0,2/5/2013,"Good location. Everyone is happy here, the menu has 2381 items. Get the orange chicken with extra glaze on the side. Treat yourself to some cheesecake."
Maria B.,"Downey, CA",117,367,217,3.0,6/2/2014,"The food is okay, our server was very friendly and attentive. however I couldn't help but feel the menu and the whole dining concept is outdated. the cheesecake wasn't even fresh.  overall it was an okay experience, but nothing to recommend as a must try."
Christopher W.,"Sierra Madre, CA",212,27,3,5.0,11/11/2014,Omg juan v. at the bar. Ive never had such a great night at cheesecake factory then the night me and my friend had sitting at the bar with juan having martinis. He funny personal and overall amazing.
Vickie T.,"Arcadia, CA",192,332,344,4.0,4/6/2013,"Like a familiar old friend, having Cheesecake Factory in old town Pasadena provides such comfort that when you run out of food ideas you can always go there for some sure wins. I was going to get the Cajun Jambalaya as I always do, but decided to give Miso Salmon a try. The dish looked so  yummy in some Yelp pictures. And I was not disappointed! It really lived up to others' raving reviews! Compared to Roy's miso fish dish, this one is just as tasty and it is more reasonably priced - $36 vs. $20? Cheesecake Factory wins this one! Of course, I cannot end this review without talking about cheesecakes. Today I tried the Chocolate Tuxedo Cream cheesecake. Layers of chocolate and vanilla plus cheesecake was simply delicious!"
J. Adam R.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,11,,5.0,1/21/2014,"Stopped in to this new - for - us location of Cheesecake Factory.  Familiar with the menu and expectations,  but happily surprised at our experience.  I can't even remember the name of the server that we originally had...don't know if he went on break or was cut, but it didn't matter.  He introduced Melody to us and after taking our initial order, he was gone and never seem again. Melody seemed to have psychic powers of what/when/how things needed to be.  I can't remember the last time I was anywhere but the bar at any Cheesecake Factory and not having to chase a server down for a refill.  Melody wouldn't allow a drink to go dry if her life depended on it.  She was attentive to us and all her tables and gracefully attended to any/all requests. She was charming and engaging, yet not obtrusive.  She has risen to the top of favorites at any CF location.  Melody's service made up for whatever his name was and the lack of engagement by the hosts."
Elena K.,"Valencia, CA",21,43,20,5.0,4/30/2014,"Everything we ordered was great (zucchini fries are amazing, and the salad was fresh) but what REALLY made our night was our server Kourtney H, and that's what my 5 stars is for. She was attentive, friendly, GENUINE, not intrusive and knew her stuff. I'm sorry if any of this sounds like hyperbole when it's not intended to be anything but a statement of the facts - she's a treasure in The Cheesecake Factory's front-of-house team because she's what every server should be."
John L.,"Cerritos, CA",1028,162,475,4.0,5/8/2012,"OMG how can this be on a day like this and the time???? jam pack i figure it would be on a weekend not a weeknights. after a long day of BS and meeting came by here go to enjoy dinner, when i show up wow!!! the long line i figure I'll just enjoy my meal at the bar,  i head over there and man.... so many people drinking and waiting for there table. sat down and order my self a drink and appetizer.  it sure too a while and the food came out it was not hot but it was warm. I'm still okay with that. while eating my meal I'm getting jab from the crow,  people eyeballing my meal while they waited. this was not a good feeling. like i said the bar is pack from people waiting to get there table. well my meal didn't last long and i was not full so i diced to leave."
Missing F.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,25,,2.0,6/25/2012,"My experience here is actually similar to the other negative ratings. I actually enjoyed that they offered such a broad menu. Chain restaurants generally don't specialize to begin with, and OTP has always been rather crowded anyway. However, the gripe I have is with the food itself. The portions are way too big and this place leaves me nauseated for some reason. At first I thought it was just me after the first time in Arcadia, but nope, happened after my visits here too. I don't know what it is, even eating salads makes me queasy. Their food is oily and gross after the first couple bites. Finally, they do make good cheesecake. There's enough variety to try for awhile."
Jess B.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,45,,2.0,10/14/2012,"I don't like chain restaurants but I had a gift card. We sat in the bar and it took forever to get a waiter to even look us in the eye so we could kindly ask for the table to be wiped down. I know they all saw us standing next to the only open, messy, table in there but clearly were too busy to stop and ask if they could assist.  We finally sat and our waiter was nice but she put our silverware right on the table top after it had been wiped down by the busser which was gross bc i was a server and I know how those towels are. She also forgot to give us napkins. When she took my order, I told her what I'd like and added a glass of wine, and after she took my bf's order she scurried off. We waited about 15 minutes for our drinks (a glass of wine and a beer) and I finally asked her when they were coming she ran stared at me questionably and realized she forgot about them and ran to the bar which was where they were sitting. We got our food almost immediately after that which sucked... The guy who gave her a break was a better server than her."
Diane C.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",592,1015,529,4.0,4/29/2010,"Been coming here for years and all the hassle of waiting can be much but the food is worth it. The service is great once you pass the man made gate of waiting patrons.  The food is great and the drinks are even better. It's the busiest Cheesecake and the tables are a little too close.  Even though it's one of my favorites, I can only give it 4 stars for the behavior of people that take your name and the unkempt restrooms."
Srikanth N.,"San Jose, CA",87,9,,4.0,9/28/2014,One of my friend baught a tiramisu cake and Mexican chicken pasta . Outstanding flavor and taste .
Odaliz R.,"Los Angeles, CA",93,237,884,4.0,6/15/2013,"I order the same item each and every time, rotisserie chicken with mashed potatoes. The wait time can be a little gruesome, but always worth every bite!"
Elisa H.,"Pasadena, CA",1,34,2,2.0,11/9/2015,"I asked to be seated for 3. The host seated 4 other families (that were parties of 3+) before us even though we checked in before. The host, (younger girl didn't seem to like me) wasn't very friendly and had a bit of attitude. Finally we were seated and the waitress took over 15 minutes to even say hi or to ask us for drinks. Our soups were cold and we asked for them to warm them up, when they brought them back for the second time, THEY WERE STILL COLD. Nachos and the sweet tamales weren't warm either. Super pricey for terrible service and tasteless cold food."
David R.,"Altadena, CA",64,205,239,4.0,3/24/2014,"Desserts!  So good...Cheesecake Factory lives up to it's name with it's 40-something cheesecakes.  I liked the Rocky Road Sundae, mmmmm...still thinking about it, and I ate it last week!"
