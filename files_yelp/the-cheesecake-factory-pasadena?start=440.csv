Christine H.,"Pasadena, CA",1020,355,67,5.0,12/18/2012,"How can anyone not like the cheesecake factory?! You don't need to read the reviews to know it's DELICIOUS and CHEAP! :) I'd rather come here than Denny's, same price for better quality! (and Free bread, me likes free bread.)"
Angie W.,"Alhambra, CA",1017,600,491,3.0,1/1/2012,"This Cheesecake is in the heart of Old Town and is ALWAYS packed!! But if you come at Happy Hour, its not that bad.  ;)  They have a pretty good Happy Hour menu and drinks.  Love the wheat bread that comes out :) We used to come to this CF before the Santa Anita one was around. It is a pretty decent sized location at the corner of Fair Oaks and Colorado.  They have pretty nice windows so people can walk by and see what you're eating.  :P I wouldn't choose this CF but they do have some awesome awesome cheesecakes if you just want to pick it up to go.  Enjoy!"
Shannon W.,"Los Angeles, CA",605,168,375,3.0,2/4/2013,"Celebrated my mom's birthday here tonight! It's usually pretty packed during its busy hours on Friday nights and on weekends, but there's practically no wait on a weekday. Between the three girls of our family, we ordered a BBQ Chicken Pizza, a Shrimp Angel Hair Pasta and a slice of Red Velvet Cheesecake. I'm not a pizza person, but I thought the pizza was very good. The crust was sweet and the taste was flavorful. It was great. The pasta, however, was just mediocre. I felt like it was a bit overpriced for just diced tomatoes, some pasta and five jumbo shrimp. And the red velvet cheesecake never fails. I've ordered this every time and sometimes just for to-go! It is a must, but who am I to say anything since it's also the only one I've tried. I'm extremely content with the cheesecake, although it puzzles me that the size of it varies depending on what day you go? (I can't exactly figure it out).  Take advantage of the ""Skinnylicious"" menu, because some of that stuff is good and pretty healthy. It will lessen your guilt when you indulge in your cheesecake. I recommend the Turkey & Avocado Sandwich. The complimentary bread is really good, but especially the brown one. I always ask for seconds. The service was decent and the waiters gave my mom a complimentary ice cream sundae and a little birthday song, which I thought was sweet."
Kathy V.,"Los Angeles, CA",16,62,,1.0,4/26/2014,"Emboldened by my positive experience in Glendale a few days before, I wanted a repeat for Sunday brunch in Pasadena. Sorry to say, this time around, the food was terrible - same dish - but... The fish was passé and I felt nauseated. Even the mash potatoes were atrocious."
Ankush D.,"Pasadena, CA",104,32,,5.0,7/18/2013,Really a good place to have dinner. Love the desserts ! And the servers are amazingly polite !
Paul D.,"Pasadena, CA",344,192,108,1.0,12/14/2011,"Remember when you could walk into the cheesecake factory, be seated quickly, and be able to order your food and it was good? Yeah, me neither. We saw that the bar was empty so we stupidly thought the bartender would - you know - help us. Sadly blondie boy was too busy twiddling his thumbs and looking at the drink menu to want to serve us. Sure he looked at us for a split second about 20 times - long enough to let us know he knew we were there, but not long enough to grab his attention. After about 15 minutes we took off to Saigon Noodle, where we were immediately seated and had our food within 10 minutes (and it was full).  So in closing, #$%@ you blondie boy. Whatever the hell your name is. You're a g'damn douchebag ""bartender"" who probably can't get a better gig due to the lack of serving skills. Or maybe you're just a moron who can't handle writing down a lunch order."
Anni K.,"Pasadena, Los Angeles, CA",3,26,2,4.0,4/10/2014,"This is my I don't know where to eat restaurant! But their food is always great! Services depends, I've had really good experiences and some bad ones too. Make sure to try the stuffed mushrooms and texmex egg rolls! You won't be disappointed !"
Jesus Javier H.,"El Monte, CA",23,37,215,3.0,11/22/2012,"This place obviously is pretty famous but that shouldn't mean that your food should be mediocre. I ordered the fettuccini Alfredo with shrimp and chicken. It was really good but honestly I've been to a smaller Restaraunt that served it just as good. I also tried the salmon there but I felt it needed a little bit more flavoring. Maybe I'm just being a little picky but its what I thought.  Overall, the food was delicious but could of been better!  The serving sizes are great though !!!!"
Alexander L.,"Alhambra, CA",10,14,2,2.0,4/25/2014,"Probably the worst service I have ever received from this resturaunt. Wait time was an estimated 35 min for 6 people, and it ended up being 50 min. Parties of 5 got called and we where there and they wouldn't give us their table even though we where the only ones waiting. The host was rude and very unfriendly when we asked how much longer because we had been waing for 50min already. The manager came up and asked what we where waiting for because he had seen our group waiting for quite some time, then 2 seconds after he talked to host he called us and seated us himself. After explaining what happened, he spoke with the red headed host and offered us free appitizers. Overall not a good experience and the food wasn't that good."
Ed T.,"Glendale, CA",0,6,3,4.0,11/13/2015,I've been to differents cheesecake factory and i've had a good experience at all of them. Had lunch there today every thing was perfect. Quality food.
Sabrina T.,"Temple City, CA",14,12,1,1.0,4/22/2014,"This location sucks.... Its tuesday afternoon so why am i waiting over 20 minutes for a table for 2 people!!!! Im so mad i dOnt even care how the food is to wait to write this review..... And u never notice things until u r waiting..... The servers uniforms are all white, white pants, shirt, aprons... So why are their shoes so filthy and disgusting.... All of them are nasty and not white they are all black and grey and look really disgusting.... I am defintely not coming back... Im only still here because my bf wants this, but i already told him we are never coming back ever again!!! Its horrible!!!! Oh and i just asked whats the hold up, they said because the other tables are closed off and they dont have enough staff to serve them. So us paying guests have to wait for them to open up a table"
Sheila K.,"Emeryville, CA",261,598,51,3.0,10/5/2010,"I like The Cheesecake Factory.  I don't think I have ever had a bad meal here.  I enjoy their salads, small bites and specialities, etc.   This is mainly to review the service of this branch and etc.  We came here on a Sunday afternoon and didn't have to wait too long for a table.  That was a plus.  There was this crazy lady though that got all up into the hostess' business.  She was one angry lady, I  don't really know what crawled up her butt, but she needed to calm down.   This place had a strange smell though, that was unpleasant and resulted in their 3 star rating.  Our waitress was nice and the food came out hot and fresh.  This place could improve by making the place smell more inviting."
Amy L.,"Anaheim, CA",1694,360,823,5.0,9/13/2012,most of the cheesecake factory that i have been to is about the same. just the different service..sometimes. either way. this location is pretty good because you get to walk around old town pasadena after :)  i always end my meal of caramel chicken with some kind of cheesecake :) delicious. fyi: please try their caramel chicken!! supeerrr good. if you like orange chicken..i think you'll like caramel chicken from cheesecake factory ;)
John P.,"Temple City, CA",45,30,3,4.0,4/18/2014,"I don't come here often but when I do I usually order the Cajun jambalaya.. It's the OG dish, still da shit after all these years..  Vanilla bean is also one of my old time favorites.. Love chain restaurants only cuz u can expect their quality to always remain the same"
Maria M.,"Culver City, CA",0,8,,5.0,4/3/2014,Jerry is the best bartender ever....... He is always very very busy but makes you feel at home.... If you want a real great Lemon Drop...he is your guy...
Kiana P.,"Pasadena, CA",36,1,,5.0,10/27/2015,"My husband and I were on a Friday night date at The Cheesecake Factory Old Town Pasadena..when it was time to pay the bill I handed the waiter my credit card to process...when the waiter returned he informed me that my card was declined.  I didn't understand because I had just deposited my paycheck a few hours before..I IMMEDIATELY get on the phone with my bank and to my horror, they said it was a glitch in their system and not to worry but my account would be back to normal in a few days.  My husband also went to get money out of his brand new savings account but since it was new he had to actually activate his card INSIDE the bank, which was now closed. Talk about embarrassing!!!  Long story short we talked to the manager and he was so understanding about the situation that he allowed us to come back in a few days with the money for our bill...no questions asked. And we did exactly that. Just wanted to give our sincere thank you to the manager and the staff members who were so kind and understanding.  THEY ROCK!!!!"
Abcde A.,"Chino, CA",0,75,5,3.0,5/18/2016,Went here for lunch today with 6 other coworkers. Server was a little over confident not using a pad to take down our orders which seemed pretty amazing IF they had all been right but three of them weren't. Then I asked for more bread and was told they were OUT of bread which was odd for a middle of the week noon time lunch. After receiving 4 correct meals we noticed the couple at the table next to us receive a basket of bread but we were told they were out? I asked the server who brought out their basket could he bring us bread and he replied yes but never returned. Upon paying for our check our server asked was their anything else he could get for us and I jokingly replied yah some bread but you don't have anymore. He replied I'll see what I can do and returned with warm TO GO bread for us. Then why tell us that lie in the first place when we saw other guests being given bread?  This may be minor to some but it's the honestly and integrity being displayed by workers to guests that bring return customers. Myself and two other coworkers would have liked bread with our meals but weren't given that true option. If there's a limit say that too but 4 of our 7 party arrived before and half eaten baskets were on the table. That's all.
KD M.,"Covina, CA",69,71,38,4.0,1/18/2012,"I went here with a few girlfriends on Saturday night and I had a really good time. For starters, they don't take reservations and for a party of 4 we waited over an hour just for a table even though they said it would be a half hour. It was busy and people were crowding around the tiny hostess stand bumping into me and other people left and right. Really, all this fuss for Cheesecake Factory? I was busy talking to my friends though so it didn't bother me too much. Anyway, our servers name was Josh and he was so sweet and attentive. He didn't make any mistakes and he brought everything out in a timely manner. I even spoke to the manager to tell him how good the service was. I ordered the four seasons pizza (I think thats what it's called), and it was okay, nothing out of this world but still yummy nonetheless. Portion sizes are huge here too, I only had a slice and a half and I was done, but then again I eat like a little birdy! It isn't my favorite place, but the ambience  was really nice and I'd come back if I'm in the Pasadena area."
Valerie S.,"South Bend, IN",317,139,23,4.0,3/12/2012,"I always love this place. I LOVE the skinnylicious vegetable salad. I went there and met a couple of friends. The waiter was prompt and the food came quickly. I love the ambiance here: the lighting the atmosphere.  Food was amazing, the bread fresh and the service very prompt. Their veggie salad is better than most vegan/vegetarian places."
