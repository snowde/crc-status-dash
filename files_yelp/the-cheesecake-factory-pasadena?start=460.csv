James Y.,"Pasadena, CA",475,356,34,1.0,1/15/2015,"The service here SUCKS!!!! I will never go again. I went there because I received a gift card. We were seated pretty quickly, mainly because it was a Tuesday night and pretty slow. We received the menus quickly because the hostess was the one that had them. We all sat down and waited and waited and waited. Finally, the waiter comes to take our drink orders, most of us got our drinks but the kids did not, we had to remind the waiter, after we received our food. I ordered the kobe burger, medium, with fries. I got the burger, it was well done, told the waiter and he said that he would tell the manager, nothing happened. The runners said the fries would be right up because they are making them hot. Well I was pretty much done with my burger by the time I received my fries, yes, they were hot. So, we decide, don't know why, to order dessert. I ordered the ""hot"" chocolate and a couple of my friends ordered cheesecake. Again, we waited and waited and waited. We were going to leave then finally my ""hot"" chocolate came, it was luke warm near cold. The kids were asleep so we had to get a box for their cheesecake. Mind you, the restaurant was empty. Not sure but for some reason when restaurant is empty, the service is slower. Again, never going back to this location. They always have bad service. First time, I think I ever did 10% tip, probably shouldn't have tipped at all."
Hector O.,"Downey, CA",4,14,10,5.0,7/19/2014,"Great friendly service by the staff every time I come here ! Wait time was not too bad for a Saturday evening, which is surprising. Only had to wait for 5 minutes before getting seated. I recommend trying out the Chocolate Raspberry Truffle cheesecake for dessert"
Enid C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,4,,1.0,8/9/2011,"Naked in restroom!! I have never given a review before. I was always the one looking at other people's review deciding whether to visit the restaurant based on their reviews. Well unfortunately, this experience was bad enough that I felt compelled to review. Strike One: The waitress made a mistake on my order. I ordered a Hawaiian pizza and instead of a Hawaiian pizza I got a ""white pizza"".  (No big deal, everyone makes mistakes) Strike Two: My daughter, a toddler was getting hungry and frustrated after waiting for our pizza.  The waitress brought me back a pizza with chicken and barbecue. Not Hawaiian as ordered ( ) (Ok I could deal graciously with two mistakes.  Strike three:  we got the Hawaiian pizza after the third attempt but third time was not a charm. I am sorry to say it was not very good. It tasted as though it was rushed through the cooking process. However, I could handle all this... (here comes the doozy) After eating I took my three year old to the restroom and only to be surprised by watching a NAKED person (yes!!!! Naked No socks, shoes , underwear, COMPLETELY NAKED giving themselves a country bath in the restroom!)  If you do not want to explain to your toddler why the pizza keeps disappearing, why there is a naked person in the restroom, or why there is an overwhelming and lingering stench due to homeless infiltrations screaming obscenities after being asked to leave (After we alerted the staff) Then do not come here. I used to visit on occasion but I will not be coming back. With all that being said I have to say that they were ""nice enough"" to comp my friend her salad though... Nothing from my bill hmmm.... Disappointed"
Sarah L.,"South Pasadena, CA",22,5,2,1.0,9/18/2013,"Wow seriously everytime I come here I can never get decent service. Came here to just have some lunch with my mom, & we waited about 5 minutes and we got seated at a dim small booth so we asked the hostess (who seemed nice enough in the beginning) her name is (marquee)if we could sit at the booth right near the window. & when we got to the booth near the window it was a little too small for us, so we asked if we could sit at the bigger booth literally right next to it, and she gave off this loud sigh the first time I asked to move and by the second time she even gave off an even bigger sigh and rolled her eyes. Are you freaking kidding me?! It's just 5 steps, I didnt ask to be moved around the whole damn restaurant. Ridiculous! That had already ruined my meal to the point where I wanted to eat somewhere else but I didnt, & I wish I had."
Gary H.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,15,,4.0,9/18/2015,"The food is always very good, the cheesecake is supreme. Prices are a bit much, but you're on scenic and trendy Colorado Blvd, so pay up. Always crowded and customers seem to be a bit interested in the L.A., did you see me on T.V lifestyle rather than the being polite and enjoying the good food. Great Service, each visit. Very, very loud, which makes for a lucrative business conversation..."
Neen H.,"Temple City, CA",235,47,8,4.0,1/20/2012,"I'm a regular and come once a week for mostly lunch.   Service First and foremost this is where they excel at this location.  They have consistently excellent service.  When there is a problem a dish they are very quick to correct the problem and offer comps (like taking off the dish or giving you free Cheesecake).   To compare and contrast, the Arcadia location's service is no where near this attentive. When they are accepting applications for servers, which is only a couple times a year, I've been told they receive hundreds of applications and only choose a select bunch to become servers.  I think their service is largely credited to that process. Food Being a regular, I cycle through my favorite dishes and they are consistently good and served freshly made and piping hot. Recommendations: Snack Plate: Fried Zucchini   Soup: Wednesday's Baked Potato Soup (order extra hot) Appetizer: Fried Mac & Cheese Mains: The Pecan Crusted Cat Fish (this is an off the menu special) Chicken Bellagio (tender breaded chicken filet over pesto marinated spaghetti ) Pasta Da Vinci (their most popular pasta, sweet sauce, tender chicken) Herb crusted Salmon - lunch portion is very generous...order it with broccoli instead of asparagus  Skinnylicious Menu: Taco's plate (chicken) fantastic, light, healthy Cheesecake: Red Velvet, Pumpkin (seasonal), key lime The Bad This place doesn't take reservations and gets so busy its frustrating.  Even on weekdays, you need to arrive around 1145 for lunch service, otherwise you'll be stuck waiting 20+ minutes.  There are special deals maybe once a year here, so you'll always be stuck with their semi-high prices.   Overall Great spot for date night or the family or a business meal as long as you come early.  Good quality, consistent food.  Impeccable service.  A+"
Christine Y.,"Pasadena, CA",3,2,,5.0,7/21/2014,"I had such great service here and at the location in Arcadia! Our server, I think his name was Josh, was AMAZING! They were so quick and prompt, me and my family really felt special! They were out of mashed potatoes and came running out offering us anything we wanted to replace it! On top of that they gave us the mashed potatoes about 20 minutes later when it was ready, and on top of THAT they gave us free cheesecake! Wow that's what I call fantastic service! The Arcadia location service was also amazing! Great food as well, just a little bummed that they changed the veggie burger recipe since that was my favorite thing on the menu!"
Fern X.,"Los Angeles, CA",23,181,325,4.0,4/9/2010,"Where's Penny? Doesn't she work here? Is it her day off? Thank goodness for the metro gold line because nowadays it's so fast and fairly cheap to traverse from East Los Angeles to Olden Pasadena! I know that for a fact since today I decided to try it out and to my amazement, everything paid off.  Of course this is the same CF where Penny works in The Big Bang Theory so I was eagerly excited to step inside but where were the yellow shirts and blue pants as portrayed in the sitcom?! I was deeply disappointed to see the servers dressed in white 'doctor' clothes.  As for the food, it took over 30 minutes to obtain our food which I might say it's the longest I've waited for restaurant food but everything was dispelled as soon as my BBQ Chicken Pizza arrived and my-oh-my was it delicious to the bone! I almost ate the entire pizza which I'm very proud of but sadly there wasn't any room left for their famous cheesecake and I wanted some ever so badly. Next time I'll make sure to order a slice to quench my wonder. All in all, I was very pleased with the food and the prices and would definitely eat here once more (only if Penny is my waitress - don't worry, I'll leave a good tip)."
Lily M.,"Pasadena, CA",0,13,,5.0,7/17/2015,"Cheesecake is the place to go if you don't know what to eat ,because they have so many choices. It is perfect for groups because it has something for everyone! Overall, great food at affordable prices!"
Maga G.,"La Plata, Argentina",5,32,,3.0,9/25/2014,"Really nice good and large portions, kind of dark thought, they could use some more lightning in there. Serve was really good as well."
Sarah S.,"Pico Rivera, CA",21,16,3,4.0,9/9/2012,"I've been to this place once...or was it twice? I can't remember, it's been quite a few years. From what I do remember though, eating at this restaurant was positive. The food was delicious, the employees were friendly and professional, and the setting was clean and elegant. We sat against the window which was neat because we could people watch as we ate. :)  I'd eventually like to go there again, and if I do I'll make sure that I update this review."
Ryan B.,"West Covina, CA",34,172,,4.0,9/9/2012,"I've been to several of these places.  Maybe it's due to the abundance of food options nearby, but this location had us seated within 5 minutes on a Friday night.  AWESOME!!!!!! Beyond that, it's like any other Cheese Cake Factory, good service, good desserts, and food that can be hit or miss.  My spicy cashew chicken was very good though."
Suzy W.,"Los Angeles, CA",366,252,580,4.0,7/9/2009,"You can't really go wrong with brunch at the Cheesecake Factory. None of the brunch items are spectacular, but you can at least expect a heaping portion of pretty decent food.  The French toast and Belgium waffle was particularly good....especially drenched in their maple syrup. The crab hash comes with your choice of mash potatoes, fries or diced potatoes.  It was good overall, but a little too heavy in hollandaise sauce and oil. This particular location in Pasadena is always packed so don't come when you're starved!"
Andre N.,"Beverly Hills, CA",1,42,,1.0,8/6/2013,when are they going to close this place? we have been suffering under the yoke of their oppressively mediocre food for more than a decade. i mean seriously. close your doors and go away. we don't want you.
Marina S.,"Shadow Hills, Los Angeles, CA",111,108,50,5.0,8/9/2011,hhhhmmmmm! Let's see... what are the things that I love about the Cheesecake Factory... Too many to list but here are a few: Avocado Eggrolls Lettuce wraps Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp Miso Salmon Chinese Chicken Salad BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich Apple Martini's Bikini Martini's Fresh Banana Cream Cheesecake Dulce de leche Cheesemake Upsidedown Pineapple Cheesecake and last and definatelt not least: Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake Sorry... that is a short list since the menu is HUGE and all delicious!
Adriane M.,"Burlington, KY",0,21,1,3.0,8/2/2014,Food was good. Found a shard of glass in my drink. They comped the drink and made a new one.
Henry S.,"Dublin, CA",387,1497,49,4.0,11/7/2011,"The thing I like about the Cheese Cake Factory is their wide selection of dishes.  There's something for everyone.  Last week I came to this location to take my wife's cousin out because she just started school at APU.  We came on a Thursday afternoon around 2pm so we were seated immediately.  Our server was very polite and had a great disposition.  We started off with the calamari appetizer which was delicious and along with their fresh baked bread.  For our entre we had the miso salmon, chicken Madeira and the chicken avocado club sandwich.  Everything came out great and we very good.  For dessert we had the Hershey's triple chocolate cheese cake and the pumpkin spice cheese cake.   Overall great meal and great atmosphere here."
nick g.,"Torrance, CA",480,535,41,3.0,6/19/2011,"I will admit, the only and main reason that I came in here was because of my love of the Big Bang Theory TV show. Yes, I said it. That's the only reason i went here.  I was curious mostly because I wanted to compare the differences and maybe, just perhaps possibly maybe there might be the scant possibility that the show is real and that Penny, Leonard, Sheldon, or any of the other characters on the show might be here. They, sadly, were not. )c: The super hot hostesses (gotta love LA for attracting all the wannabe models and actresses who make up our lovely city's restaurant servers, good luck to them) said that there was a wait for any tables and thatthe  bar was available, and since I was a(*cough* loser*cough*) alone, I thought I'd get a burger.  Bartender was cool, he was really friendly without really talking to me. the burger, was just a burger. My bill with a beer and tip was like 22 bucks. That's one expensive burger, but whatever, it's a high profile place in a high class city right on the tourist strip.  that's all I can say about that.  I'm not a fan of chains in general, so take it with a particle of sodium chloride. (do you know how hard it was to avoid writing this in the tone of Sheldon?)"
A. R.,"Duarte, CA",0,6,,5.0,8/21/2015,Always come by here to pick up my lunch to go! Persia and Maria are my favorite! Super friendly and always get my order exactly how I want it! They always recognize me and assist me quickly! 5 stars because of the amazing staff!
Jeff F.,"Boston, MA",398,1525,13,3.0,4/4/2010,"What happens when you're in a rush and someone else chooses lunch - you end up at the Cheesecake Factory when Pasadena actually has some good grub. I went with the Madeira chicken which was ok. If you like chain food, you might love this place"
