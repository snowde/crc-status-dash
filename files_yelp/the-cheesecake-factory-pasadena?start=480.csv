Azure S.,"Rosemead, CA",0,151,,3.0,12/26/2013,"I was seated within a few minutes of checking in with the hostess. The place was clean and nice, but unbelievably dim. They are taking energy conservation too far; there was barely enough light to read the menu. The food was good. I had the Samosas and a slice Tiramisu Cheesecake. Samosas and the dip it comes with was very good. Tiramisu was also good. Still love the complementary rye bread. If I wasn't there with other people, I would have no problem hogging the bread all to myself. I like that this place did not charge extra for splitting the check, though that's should be the norm. The waitstaff is very courteous and will say goodbye to you as you leave.  I wouldn't mind coming back, but I would do so during the daytime and ask to be seated by a window, or I would bring a flashlight to read the menu."
Jean F.,"Arcadia, CA",0,10,,1.0,12/24/2014,"Just looking for some place with a big enough menu for my group of friends so we decided to go to cheesecake. It was the wrong choice. The food was not good. The artichoke was very small and under cooked and had this odd what looked like green dye. The rest was not better. And, it took forever to get our food."
Susan L.,"West Covina, CA",21,127,16,5.0,5/19/2012,"Great food, huge portions, endless menu, fantastic service, great atmosphere.  I wasn't thrilled with the small piece of chicken that came on top of my pasta, not cut into smaller pieces at all.. just one big chunk.  The chicken had the bone in it, and lots of skin.  I figured it would be a boneless skinless chicken breast.  Surprised that you pay $3 to add it to your pasta, and that's what you get.  Didn't fit with the quality of the other ingredients. I'm very picky, and my order was fairly complicated.. I told the waiter he would get it wrong if he didn't write it down.. and sure enough, it came wrong.  It was entertaining though.  He swore he entered it correctly and they just made it wrong.  It literally took them about one minute to have it corrected though, I didn't mind. Parking is definitely a bitch, but that's downtown Pasadena for ya."
IYelpFor U.,"Los Angeles, CA",18,91,74,4.0,6/30/2012,"The reason: I don't come here for their cheesecakes or desserts but I come here for the awesome Jambalaya Pasta! When it comes to Cajun, and of all places; a chain like Cheesecake would probably be the last place you'll think of. The trinity of flavors that was known for Cajun Jambalaya are all here, with the dish being very well seasoned and boldly flavored. While its authenticity might not be comparable to the great folks down in the great Bayou of Louisiana but they seemed to have done an excellent job fusing it with linguine pasta instead of rice (which I've substituted a few times depending on my mood). This is the ONLY thing I crave from their menu!  The place (caution): I lost count of the number of times I've eaten here, and every visit has always been great. With that said, the food and service was also excellent...BUT...the water supply from this old building is contaminated due to old rusted pipes! The last time I ate here, I ordered a Jack & Coke and gotten very sick after a few hours with bladder infection. It got worst the next day so I had to see a doctor. He gave me a shot and prescribed some antibiotics and the problem went away. The city of Pasadena had actually brought up this issue to the restaurant and I hope they addressed it."
Hum S.,"Alhambra, Los Angeles, CA",2,25,13,5.0,8/21/2013,We ordered Thai chicken pasta and seafood jambalaya and red velvet cheesecake for dessert and I mean everything is so good.  The waiter we had he is so kind with good manner always smile.  Excellent atmosphere especially located at old Pasadena with valet parking
Marina S.,"Burbank, CA",149,228,124,2.0,4/25/2011,"I have no problem waiting in line for 60 minutes to get seated... when the food I wait for is delicious and tempting and unique.  Why there is always a crowd, and a disgustingly long wait at the Cheesecake Factory, is obviously a mystery to me. I have observed this problem at all Cheesecake Factories, but the Pasadena location is hands down the worst.  Friday or Saturday night? Forget about it - you might as well pack a portable DVD player and watch a movie if you plan to enjoy your night. Spaghetti? Tastes so normal, you might as well make it at home. Salads? The only special thing is the size. Cheesecake?  If you like cheesecake, then take it to go... Nothing, and I mean NOTHING at the Cheesecake Factory is delicious enough to warrant the wait. ...Not even the avocado egg rolls!"
Joel M.,"Pasadena, CA",236,31,2,4.0,7/1/2011,"Great Location, in the heart of Old-Town.  Not for the weary, as it gets SUPER-PACKED after 6pm or so, its one of the more popular places in Pasadena. I usually find myself going to the bar for seating rather than waiting 30-60minutes for a table or booth.  If your date is cool and not a total jerk, he/she will not mind. My 1st suggestion: Chicken Madera...almost the only thing I eat there anymore, and I don't even like mushrooms. My 2nd suggestion:  Park in the parking structure located behind Kenneth Cole off Colorado, they have free 90-min parking and there's always room."
Cruz A.,"Pasadena, CA",102,50,9,5.0,7/28/2011,What's not to like? Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp - awesome! Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake - awesome! Everything else - awesome!
Gracia P.,"Santa Clarita, CA",0,17,11,4.0,4/23/2014,I'm usually skeptical about chain restaurants but this one is just wonderful. I love their Moroccan chicken. The ambiance is comfortable and the service is always nothing short of friendly and accommodating.
Rachel A.,"Covina, CA",0,10,2,3.0,11/3/2013,Ehh More vegan gf options i think
Bashar A.,"Bell Gardens, CA",13,42,13,3.0,3/24/2012,Nice place. Was crowded around 3 pm. They said they will seat us in 15 mins but they did it in less than 10 which was good. It took them around 10 mins to get us the drinks but when we switched tables and changed waiters the other guy was very fast very social and served us a good lunch. I asks for a big burger and they got me one that I wasn't able to finish! The tucsido  cheese cake was more than amazing
Jimmy B.,"Pasadena, CA",174,180,222,2.0,12/2/2013,Carnitas chilaquiles ! Look good but dont get them. Stale chips and flavorless carnitas. Get the salad.
Tiffany Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",50,45,9,4.0,9/16/2014,"Came in with friends on a Monday night around 7 and there was no wait! Our waitress was so attentive and continually refilled our water cups and boxed our leftovers for us. As for the food, our table ordered farfalle pasta with chicken and garlic sauce, skinnylicious salmon, lemon chicken and potatoes, garlic noodles with chicken, tomato basil pasta, the gluten free chocolate cheesecake and the pineapple upside down cheesecake. All was good, the portions were huge!"
Christine H.,"Pasadena, CA",252,773,409,1.0,5/28/2009,SPAM in their menus. Weak sauce. Salty. The cheesecakes suck.
Tom M.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,63,29,5.0,11/3/2011,"Thank you Cheesecake Factory Pasadena. You never let us down, we always leave full and happy. Amazing you can have such a large menu and still have everything come out great! Seriously food lovers, whats not to love here? Perhaps the long lines but hey any good establishment has that problem. I give these guys 5 stars for being so damn consistent over the past decade."
Myra W.,"Houston, TX",641,21,12,2.0,10/21/2014,Front staff was great. Wait staff not so much .. Came in for cheesecake and it was soft. Waiter had a slight attitude about exchanging for cake.
Mary D.,"Norwalk, CA",629,224,138,3.0,1/10/2011,"I love the Cheesecake Factory for their consistency in food.  But over the years, I haven't craved to dine here in a long while.  My little diva niece loves cheesecake, so we had lunch here the other day to satisfy her appetite.   Thai Salad: skip it! I just wasn't feeling this dish.  Cold noodles and mediocre flavors.  I can do without.   Steak Diane and Shrimp: I loveeee the sauces on this dish that compliments the dish very well.  I would have licked the plate if I was left alone for just one minute haha Vanilla Bean Cheesecake:  My niece picked this.  The verdict: definitely worth the calorie splurge.  It had 3 different textures in this one slice that makes it unique.  It was perfect for sharing and not too sweet.  My sister who is not a cheesecake fan even liked it."
Astrid S.,"Santa Barbara, CA",176,46,2,4.0,7/10/2011,"Came here to meet my friend for lunch on a baking hot Tuesday. Not being familiar with Pasadena, I parked in metered parking about a block away and walked. Oh well. our waiter was very attentive but didn't crowd us.  Wasn't very busy at all, but seeing as it was the middle of the week that makes sense. I got the sundried tomato and chicken pasta, my friend got the burger. My pasta was fine, my only complaint is that it didn't have a whole lot of chicken in it. I would of got dessert but it was so hot I didn't feel like eating too much sugar. If I lived in Pasadena I would probably come here more often, but the Sherman Oaks location is closer to me."
Dani S.,"Santa Ana, CA",1006,2146,4147,1.0,2/2/2009,Come to this place if you ENJOY any of the following: - waiting in line for half an hr to be seated - pay shit load of money for crappy food - stuff yourself with large portions of overly greasy food - having to listen to the pretentious bitches sitting in the table next to yours bitch about her nails and hair
Christine D.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,5,,1.0,4/28/2015,"If I could give this place negative stars I would. I don't know what was colder...the food or the service. Our server Josh was very nice, the girl who brought out the food she was a different story. The food was cold and they did nothing about it. I want to like this place but I just can't."
