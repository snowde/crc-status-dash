Vanessa L.,"Los Angeles, CA",96,233,132,5.0,4/27/2011,"Nothing can ever go wrong with Cheesecake Factory. Came here with my fams and was seated in about 10-15 minutes. There were so many selections to choose from and I just wanted to eat everything! I end up choosing the Pasta Da Vinci and it was pretty damn good! I was just gonna end my dinner like that, but my big got me a Ultimate Red Velvet Cheesecake and HOLYSMOKEE it tasted so damn delicious that I shared some with my brother and my boyfriend(: I went back a week ago to grab some cheesecake and ordered the Red Velvet cheesecake again and damn, it feels like we were meant to be. HAHAA. The white chocolate flakes on the outside is was explodes like a orgasm in my mouth!"
Kaili C.,"Arnold, MO",4,205,30,1.0,7/29/2013,The habachi beef tasted awful... Like cow on road kill.   Warm beer yaik!!! Worse cheesecake restaurant everrrrr.   Never coming back.
Ms. Edna T.,"North Hollywood, CA",42,723,985,3.0,5/29/2011,"* Service: our waiter was very courteous, cheery, and helpful * Food: * Bistro shrimp ($17.50): usually my favorite dish at CF---but NOT yesterday. the noodles were hard and the entire dish was bland. * Happy Hour Speciail: $5.00 4pm-6pm. -- Avocado Eggrolls: delicious--especially the dipping sauce -- Petite pizza(roasted pears and bleu cheese): ok. -- Arugula Salad: too bitter. -- Fried Mac and Cheese: heart-attack balls! good, but can only have one, since it's so rich and FRIED."
Binh P.,"Rosemead, CA",5,8,1,2.0,7/10/2013,"Service was so bad here, I had to wait 20 minutes to be served. I sat there and waved some waitresses, but got ignored for the longest time. The table space is so small and the place is so dark. Kind of overpriced for just whatever-tasting like spaghetti."
Joy T.,"Irvine, CA",6,70,15,2.0,7/7/2011,"If you're here for cheesecake, as promised by the name, you'll be happy. If you're here for a nice meal, try elsewhere. Pasadena is full of delicious places at reasonable prices, if you only know where to look. For starters, avoid tourist-packed Colorado Blvd and typical chain restaurants that you can find at any other city. When you're in Old Town, go for the hole-in-the-wall places that you won't be able to experience anywhere else. Don't get me wrong... when I first moved to Pasadena, my friends and I went here often. We hadn't yet discovered the joys of little restaurants and kept Cheesecake Factory as our default. One day we ventured into Mi Piace right across the street, and found that for the same prices we paid at Cheesecake, we could have quality food and service... haven't turned back since. It was nice while it lasted, old friend, but I'm done with you for good."
Deborah K.,"Claremont, CA",190,360,2,1.0,12/28/2010,"The food here is terrible and very high in calories, fat, and sodium. I was appalled when I looked at the nutritional content menu.. I really don't understand the ridiculously long wait for a table, either. The only problem is I forget how bad it is and usually end up going back about once a year."
Angel B.,"Milton, WA",9,37,11,5.0,2/8/2012,"So good, I hate all my friends right now for never telling me how AMAZING the food and service is here. I can't wait to go back for more!!! Are server was Samantha, she was a delight so helpful and not at all super hovery ( I know not a word but u know what I mean). I was expecting a long wait time but was seated right away. All in all huge serving fast service and the food is TO DIE FOR!"
John H.,"Altadena, CA",68,87,5,4.0,1/27/2012,"Skinnylicious Menu is a great solution to the massive amounts of food portions that this place pushes down the gullet.  We had the Shrimp Salad Rolls, Green Tea, Edamame, and a MASSIVE salad (unintentionally massive) I think.  The server was super-excessively nice, the bathrooms were clean, and the view of the dudes chasing people to sell roses was prime.  Pasadena is a neat town."
Michael Y.,"Pasadena, CA",20,204,160,2.0,7/24/2013,"This was one of the worst service experiences I've had this year. I've been to many other cheesecake locations and Pasadena is by far the worst location/experience ever (on Wednesday July 24).   There was no wait when we arrived tonight, which I thought was strange but nice.  It's the first time I've not waited.. but now I know why...management, staffing and service is pretty bad. First, our physical menu was dirty (eg, sauce spilled over, dirtied our hands). And then we waited 20 minutes just to order.  We kept looking out for our waiter and he disappeared and re-appeared just to serve other tables, I think perhaps there was a lack of staff or poor coordination so it may not have been his fault.  The tables here are darker, which made it hard to read the menu, other Cheesecake locations have candles and this is never a problem. Now, the waiter had misunderstood our order even though we repeated it twice to clarify, and when the dish came out, one of our group informed him that the dish was incorrect, he blamed us, claiming that we told him wrong. That is a big no-no for any restaurant. The rest of our party heard it correctly so for this one waiter to claim that WE were wrong when it was HIM, this was totally inappropriate to shift blame to the customer. Also, water should be filled without our having to ask, but we needed to ask a staff after 1 hour of no water-filling and that was annoying. Perhaps this again was a staffing issue.  Poor resource management and/or poor operational systems. For the food, all of our appetizers and entrees including the avocado, corn dogs, pizza, all good.  Didn't have much problem, though it just didn't taste as good as we've had at other locations. Poor service really ruins the whole eating experience.  I have been to other cheesecake factory locations at least 30 times, and always trusted I would be treated well, but this is the first time when I now question whether all Cheesecakes are the same.  This one obviously was below average, but I would probably be willing to give it one more chance, if I had no other choice.  Since I think it may have been a one-off terrible night, I will be a bit more general in this review, but next time I'll be more detailed and specific with manager & staff names."
Chuck A.,"Long Beach, CA",341,347,80,3.0,4/22/2011,".., came here on a date w/ my gf Diane not too long ago. We were looking forward to eating here because we love the Cheesecake Factory. This time however was somewhat dissapointing to me. I was feeling quite carnivorous at the time, so when the words, ""Kobe Burger"" came up on the menu, I had already made up my mind. Diane went w/ their Thai Lettuce Wraps which also sounded pretty tasty. Our server that night only came 3 times:  1st- to take our order 2nd- to ask us if we wanted anything before our meal? 3rd-to give us our food (then she diassapears) We had to flag her down just to get our check. I know it was a busy night, but once we received our food, we were forgotten about. I wanted a refill too! Diane's Thai lettuce wraps were delicious. My kobe burger however, was pretty lame. It didn't even taste like ""Kobe"". It just tasted like a regular burger, yet surprisingly a step below fast food flavor. I felt I overpaid for that burger, I only ate half then I was done with it. It wasn't appealing what-so-ever.  Afterwards, we finished things off w/ a tiramasu cheesecake! It was f*cking fantastic! I wish I would have just ordered the Cheesecake instead of my my meal :-( . The Thai wraps that Diane had ordered were really good as well. All 3 of  these stars go to their cheesecake! Service didn't really stand out for us this time, maybe next!"
Eden R.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,25,21,4.0,1/27/2014,Love the white chocolate raspberry truffle cheese cake is to die for !!! Everything is great actually but come on it's the Cheesecake Factory !!
Frankie D.,"Portland, OR",348,132,45,3.0,11/21/2013,"When it comes to cheese cake factory's this one is very decent considering. It's in the middle of old town Pasadena. It has a great vibe, and It's always busy. I usually go for the happy hour. The price you just can't beat it! The hosts here are totally hit or miss. They are either great or very rude. Not to mention they served us frozen cheese cake -.- . So I would stick to the appetizers and drinks !"
Jessie M.,"Los Angeles, CA",576,1638,182,4.0,8/4/2009,"I hate to admit it, but jesus, I could eat at this place anytime. I just can not get enough of those freaking avocado eggrolls and that spicy tuna tempura roll.  Shit now I am so craving those two ... and I don't get to break for lunch for another hour! (And K A. has a good point-- they do execute most of their dishes very well and I definitely wouldn't want to be back there in that kitchen!)"
Belle B.,"Walnut, CA",155,914,12842,4.0,7/26/2011,"I love and hate this place.  Parking is an expensive pain in Old Town Pasadena.  Aside from that, this is a prime location on the corner of Colorado and Fair Oaks but it's not as large as some of the other locations.  This is a great place to eat and people watch.  It can get pretty corwded at times.  The menu is insane as there are far too many items to choose from.  Their portions are great for sharing or left overs.  Generally, there really is no room for cheesecake after a meal here."
Lids W.,"Los Angeles, CA",82,3,2,3.0,1/14/2014,"This was my first Cheesecake Factory that I've ever been to. It was a typical chain restaurant. They have a long menu, good list if cocktails, and cheesecakes of course.  I would give the food a B and the Cheesecake an A+. We had the Godiva chocolate cake and it was amazing"
Sheynna B.,"Burbank, CA",0,7,,4.0,3/5/2015,"Our waiter Josh was absolutely outstanding! He was very attentive, prompt and pleasant. He was sure to turn our initial discomfort and uninvited welcome by the hostesses into a wonderful evening. Jose was also extremely personable and accommodating. We will be sure to return ONLY because of these these two (Josh & Jose) and their exceptional service."
Karen B.,"Newport Beach, CA",530,549,62,4.0,9/2/2012,"A familiar favorite, after all we all know this place has a great menu and good food. After spending the day at The Huntington Library in San Marino, we decided to go to Old Town Pasadena. Yelped places to eat since we were looking for a local favorite spot but it appeared that a few places in the area were busy so opted for a place where we knew we could be seated.Our server Bridgette was very attentive and the service was exceptional. I ordered the Luau Salad. It was filled with lots of greens, cucumbers, peppers, seeds, macadamia nuts, wontons and chicken...was very good except too much dressing. Bread was fresh, passion ice tea was delicious. My boyfriend had the Ahi Salad, also great. It is cool that they now offer a lunch size portion on their menu of many items, trust me they are still large! We left with 2 cheesecakes to go. Note to self, DO NOT order a cheesecake that has any mousse on it, what is the point...it just is not cheesecake unless it is prepared like the original. No variations for me, thank you."
Benito L.,"Los Angeles, CA",511,291,12,3.0,12/29/2010,"Not the most creative menu, but a wide variety of solid dishes.  3.5 stars"
Eugene N.,"Temple City, CA",416,338,89,4.0,8/3/2011,"I've always been a fan of the Cheesecake Factory. I've never had a bad experience, nor food order. One of my memorable favorites is the Biscuits and Gravy! I think theres chicken in there too. My mouth waters just thinking about it.  The breakfast burrito is massive and can serve 2 people, and is available all day. One of my favorites too. My only thing about this place is that it's always packed! Still, the food is excellent and the service is great too."
Q K.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,83,3,4.0,8/30/2011,"Never hopped on the Cheesecake Factory bandwagon but now I see why people like this place. We went for lunch and chose a booth by the window. The hostess and servers were extremely friendly and responsive. The prices were reasonable, the food was solid, and the portions were great even for lunch specials. Plus, the free bread was delicious. Yes, the cheesecake was good. Don't see why we would not come back except that there are too many other great restaurants to try in this area."
