Elizabeth B.,"Pasadena, CA",1,23,10,5.0,1/27/2014,They have the best food. It's ALWAYS delicious and never disappoints. I can always count on them to serve me good food and the BEST cheesecakes =)
Eric L.,"Monterey Park, CA",92,285,,2.0,10/5/2011,"This place is seriously not worth the time and money you spend here. First of all, the food isn't all that great. They have a huge menu with different kinds of choices but I feel like they don't really specialize in anything. The portions are big so I recommend sharing if you're not a big eater. Plus you pay a lot for what you get. I would recommend coming here just got dessert, which is actually good. Also, every time I've come here for any meal, I've had to wait at least 30 - 45 minutes. Seriously, it's not worth it. You're in the middle of Old Town Pasadena, there are so many good restaurants up and down Colorado. Go try one of those and skip the long wait."
Frank D.,"South Pasadena, CA",14,111,1,4.0,9/27/2011,"2nd time reviewing. Came here for dinner with the parents. They likes their food, new Orleans shrimp, pasta with meat sauce and I had Skinny something grilled chicken. Its the same as the previous weight management chicken. I just feel like the names shouldn't be so weird. I feel the old one of weight management chicken felt like I was on the biggest loser. Yes I watch what I eat and substituted the rice for more veggies. My dates always chuckle when I order it though. Yelp!!!!!"
Jeremy C.,"Pasadena, Los Angeles, CA",14,31,7,1.0,11/1/2011,"I would give this cheesecake factory the poorest possible score. The food is the same as any other factory, but the timeliness of service is unexceptional. They try to placate people with bread, when they should focus on getting some drinks and food orders to the customers. It doesn't appear to be from lack of staff, as there is a ton all over the place. This leads me to think one of two things, either the staff are incompetent, or it is poorly directed by management. I was here for dessert and coffee on a Tuesday night, and they still can't handle the load. Try coming here on a Friday or Saturday, and that will be impossible. Our server was Kourtney. She was very nice, and probably used to people flat out refusing what they ordered due to long waits. The good side is that if you call for an order for carry out, they usually are pretty good with that or if you just picking up dessert at the dessert bar."
Jennifer I.,"La Jolla, CA",161,64,43,2.0,5/2/2011,"So.. their food is good, and I've had many pleasant experiences (none over-the-top)-- but recently I experienced really unprofessional behavior from them. We put our names down, went over to the bar to have a glass of wine, and then had the person in charge of seating come over and give us attitude --- with a frown/scowl saying well, even though we've been waiting 10 minutes, they won't seat us because one of the people in our party wasn't present (that person was handicapped and took longer to walk over)-- REALLY?? She said she was cancelling our name. She was actually talking back at us and snapping, saying there are other people waiting too.  I know we all may have bad days, so I'll give her the benefit of the doubt -- I'm sure she's really a nice person (and she was really pretty too)-- but her attitude sucked! The manager apologized A LOT, and we ended up getting seated-- and our server was just a doll, and the food rocked.. but still, they could have been more professional. I had never been treated like that before, and I've gone to this Cheesecake Factory since 1999. That incident alone made me not have too much faith in this branch."
Andrea A.,"Altadena, CA",0,19,,1.0,2/9/2015,"This is not a review on the food, but rather the service and overall management of this location.  I was really surprised and disappointed that the hostess let my mother and I walk out of the restaurant after we refused to wait 20 minutes for a booth when multiple booths were open. We went to Cheesecake Factory for an early dinner at about 6:00 and we got right in and were shown to a table with one bench seat and one chair. My mother is 67 with a bad back and while I am half her age, I had also recently injured my back and need more support than a cane backed chair. Before accepting the table, we asked if we could instead have one of the two-top mini booths 10 feet away. 2 of the 3 mini booths were open. The hostess (who seemed like she was in training) informed us that the waitstaff for that area wasn't in yet and it would likely be a 20 minute wait, but that we could go back up to the hostess desk and check. So we went back up front (where I also saw more booths open) and we were told that it would be a 20 minute wait for a booth. Since that was absolutely ridiculous, we walked out.   I was shocked and annoyed and the next time someone suggests eating at Cheesecake Factory, I will suggest elsewhere. But I am happy to know that Cheesecake Factory is doing so well that they are perfectly fine allowing two paying customers to walk out."
Clement H.,"Los Angeles, CA",235,566,46,4.0,5/30/2009,"Very nice place for a nice evening with my friend. We came here on Wednesday night and had a great diner and our waitress was really nice with us. [Joe] She was cool, relaxed and not pushy on selling. I like the atmosphere and the service was great. The food was well prepared and I had my glass of wine as always. What else can I ask for for such a nice and enchanted evening. Will definitely go back."
Norman L.,"Alhambra, CA",83,105,21,3.0,7/29/2013,I'm going to have to say no bueno for Cheesecake Factory. Maybe cause I'm so use to Asian food but I just didn't like it all that much. Stars are for awesome customer service :)
Jason A.,"Cerritos, CA",1079,700,1631,5.0,10/20/2008,"For a Cheesecake Factory, this is probably as good as it gets. A couple stories and on a busy intersection in Old Town Pasadena. This particular location is so popular that I and my friends had to wait 2 hours to be seated. So what's a group of friends to do when you have two hours to burn? Drink at the nearest bar, of course! So naturally, we wandered across the street for a little bit and found a sports bar showing the NBA All-Star game slam dunk contest. We chilled on some beers and watched a little bit of the contest before summoning up the wherewithal to go back and check to see if ""Jason"" had been called. Not yet. So we hung out outside and stood on the intersection and got in hundreds of people's way. It's an incredible way to people-watch. A cold night usually makes people dress up more, and seeing some of the ladies display their cold-time clothes can be impressive. Remember, we don't have winters in Los Angeles. Once we actually did get called, I remember having a nice window view of the same intersection we were standing on earlier. It was rather impressive at night, seeing the people populate that area and staring at you eat. I got the steak diane, another trusted and true choice and some more beers. I started hitting on some tannish looking girls sitting at the table next to us after throwing back a few. Never talk about the other person's exotic race, unless they bring it up. Otherwise, you just might look like a racist. I think we left there pretty buzzed not only from what we drank at restaurant, but from also the sports bar from earlier. It's a good way to make a trip to another ordinary restaurant more memorable."
Evy R.,"Los Angeles, CA",51,94,42,4.0,3/24/2013,"Big portions here. I had the fresh salmon with mash potatoes which was great. The menu is overwhelming, too many choices for me. Good for a birthday because they embarrass you & sing to you =}"
Ruth K.,"Altadena, CA",161,459,3053,4.0,4/26/2009,"According to a waiter I chatted with on one of my periodic visits, their most popular dish is the Chicken Madeira.  And it just so happens that's what my husband and I almost always order.  That one item on the menu keeps bringing us back for more and more.  The slightly sweet Madeira wine sauce has mushrooms in it and we always ask for an extra side of the sauce so we can eat it with the mashed potatoes.  YUMMY!  Try it if you haven't yet."
Anna B.,"Pasadena, CA",0,14,4,4.0,2/15/2014,"Love this cheesecake, mostly because it's close by. I love the barbecue ranch ckn salad or the miso salmon. The staff is friendly, and the food is consistently great. You have to try the Oreo cheesecake!"
MadBunny ..,"Pasadena, CA",366,88,88,5.0,5/2/2012,"CHEESECAKE - TIME!!!!!!! great service, great food. Just park in the public parking lot around the corner and enjoy yourselves in this lovely restaurant."
J J.,"Alhambra, CA",0,36,,3.0,1/26/2013,Chicken marasala - tender and flavorful Server not memorable. Noisy.
Karla V.,"Los Angeles, CA",21,168,71,4.0,6/2/2013,"Service was great the hubby ordered the cajun jambalaya and he loved it, I on the other hand ordered based on the recommendation of our waitress the Bistro shrimp pasta that comes in a lemon sauce with arugula and fried battered shrimp.. The batter on the shrimp was just plain weird crispy on the outside but very soggy on the inside. The sauce was just way too sour for me and it didnt help that I had ordered a lemonade. I would definitely wouldnt recommend that dish. Other then that that the wait was minimal. Our waitress was attentive and prompt. And the bread of basket was delish."
Hungry Polar Bear X.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,11,1,5.0,10/11/2010,"CHEESECAKE AND STRANGE MEN My Vietnamese lady and I went to Old Town Pasadena (a.k.a. her old stomping ground, the place where she blossomed into womanhood). After walking the streets and seeing all the places where she did 'god knows what'... well, some gents would know too, we stopped at The Cheesecake Factory.  The restaurant was crowded, people looked a little bit off, and a few unknown gentleman, who knew my lady, shook my hand and told me I was a lucky guy  O.o  I was inspired by the Cheesecake on display.  We had great food, and we were at a window seat; a great spot because we pointed and commented on the ugly people of the world that lurked the streets of Old Town Pasadena. We talked too, but not about topics that typically went in circles. Our server was a homosexual.  The best part of the meal was when the check came, someone had already paid for our meal! It was yet another random gentleman, who knew my love, and quote, ""owed her one"". What a great gal I'm with... Thanks Cheesecake Factory! HPBX"
Peter K.,"Pasadena, CA",1,9,1,3.0,1/2/2012,"The factory is pretty much what you can expect from a restaurant chain -- big crowds and noise, and even bigger portions.  Cheesecake is the Michael Bay of restaurants, where the explosions happen somewhere besides on the big screen. If that's not enough to stomach, you can try to digest that huge menu of theirs.  Seriously half of the items could be removed and no one would notice. The food is fine but short of exceptional. One of their best dishes is their herb crusted filet of salmon.  I also love the brown bread -- you can skip the white bread.  Food might improve if they weren't trying to cater to so many tastes. The service is fast. Heck I went to the restroom after finishing my plate and they cleared it off while I was gone.  When I got back the hostess didn't recognize me and told me it wasn't a self seating restaurant lol. Food - 3 stars Service - 3 stars"
Kim H.,"Los Angeles, CA",451,911,481,3.0,3/21/2011,This is a chain restaurant.  Several steps above a diner but not worth 5 stars peeps.  Any place that has this much stuff on the menu can't be worth that many stars.  The cheesecake might be a 4 or 5 but the rest of the food is hit or miss.  The ambiance is great here as you are right on Colorado Blvd and walking distance to several bars and shops after lunch or dinner.  That is the only reason why I would go is because of the location location location for this place.
Chloé C.,"Los Angeles, CA",174,217,262,4.0,4/21/2011,"You can't really go wrong with Cheesecake factory. After being to at least 3 different ones in Los Angeles, I still do not understand why there is always a wait. Dinner time is always busy. The cheesecakes, of course, are overpriced and delicious. I would definitely get the red velvet cheesecake.  I usually get a pasta dish at Cheesecake Factory. The jambalaya is good, as well as the Chicken Bellagio. I would recommend the Chicken Bellagio only if you really like chicken and pasta.  One of my favorite parts of this restaurant are the free bread. The wheat and white are both warm and very good."
Maria A.,"Washington, DC",404,287,7,5.0,10/26/2010,"I love this particular location of Cheesecake Factory- It's centric, I can go shopping at J crew while I wait for a table, and get gelato after dinner if I'm not in the mood for a cheesecake or pie. The food always delivers- My family is obsessed with this place, thus I have been to C.F. wayyy more than I've wanted to or needed to in the past two months. My favorite dishes: Chicken Madeira, spicy chicken sandwich, grande burrito, and their super disgustingly big appetizer sampler. Delicious! Apparently a slice of their chocolate blackout cake is 1500 calories. But I would gladly just eat this cake and nothing else the whole entire day.  PS. they have cute waiter (s)."
