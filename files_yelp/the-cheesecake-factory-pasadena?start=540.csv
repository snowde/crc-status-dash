Peter Y.,"Chino, CA",58,119,84,5.0,5/14/2013,"We came here for a ""going away"" get together for a real close friend on Mother's Day weekend so I expected long wait, poor service and rush rush rush. What we got was a great dinner experience.  I got there 1/2 hour before our meeting time since they didn't take weekend night time reservations. After about 20 or so minutes I get a call from them saying that a party ahead of us cancelled and we're more than welcomed to take their table and I'm like hell yeah! We sat and the rest of our party showed up shortly. Drinks ordered, appetizers ordered and then main course ordered. Either they're quick and organized or our conversations kept us busy that we didn't even noticed.  I ordered the Moroccan chicken which was good. Not even sure what I decided to order until the very last minute. I normally go for the shrimp scampi but changed it at the very last minute. Not really sure why come to think of it. I just looked down when it was my turn to order and guess that's what I saw right in front of me. Whew... What the hell were we talking about that put me in that position? Anywho, it was a good choice cause the wifey was picking on my plate.  I had an iced tea cause I'm not an alchie. And coffee at the end. Tiramisu was amazing but too much whipped cream. Oh, the table was cleaned and water/Iced T replenished quite often that we never saw an empty cup. Great experience and will definitely return."
Alixandrea M.,"Pasadena, CA",620,131,94,3.0,4/14/2010,"Ok, to be fair........They saw my complaint (Thank you, yelp) contacted and sent me a gift card and letter of apology to try my experience again. The corporate office also called me to make sure I was doing alright.  I went back yesterday for happy hour (which was very empty, probably because of the 4-6pm short time frame) I took a friend and we enjoyed our drinks very much...really tasty mojitos that actually packed a punch. The kind that sneak up on you.  I stayed away from the chicken this time, no meat at all actually. I'm not risking being sick to my stomach for a week (!!!) again. For $5 at happy hour you get a really big serving of guacamole that they make freshly, it's probably the best deal they have. The corn tamale cakes were OK, a little mushy, not like the ones you can get at El Torito...the sauce that went with them was really zesty. The Thai noodle salad was decent. Service kind of sucked. We waited about 15 minutes before a server came over finally to take our order. While they were pretty empty. Go figure? I still won't be back per my own suggestion, but I guess they're ok in my book."
Toma C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1042,4186,1.0,12/30/2012,"I came here to buy two whole cheesecake and the one thing I hate is getting the wrong thing hen you get home.  In my case to a party... I was to get a fresh strawberry and 10"" tuxedo cheesecake.  I think they gave me the Kalua cheesecake.  What a disappointment!!  I had the craving for the chocolate tuxedo.  At this point I would return it.  But I think they should confirm the order when you get it.  I spent a ot money and if you know me I always ask for Cheesecake Factory."
Edward C.,"Pasadena, CA",1,14,,4.0,1/24/2014,"This is one of my favorite restaurants. There are so many varieties to choose including salad, entrée, appetizer and of course dessert. The environment is the same as the other Cheesecake restaurant. It used to be at least an hour and a half wait. But it was only about 15 to 20 minutes.  Food quality is good as usual. I still enjoy their bread a lot."
Romeo S.,"Seattle, WA",371,575,18,4.0,3/22/2012,My favorite place to eat with the Mrs. While in Old Towne. Parking is still an issue.
Derek W.,"Los Angeles, CA",467,633,2477,3.0,2/24/2011,"As with other Cheesecake Factories, the food here in the Pasadena location is no different than any of the others.  Service is always good and they always have warm wheat bread.  Parking here is limited to street and 90 mins free at the public lots.  Be prepared to wait as this location is typically busy."
Ev E.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,4.0,1/20/2015,"Went in today to celebrate my friend's birthday (party of 8 and the wait time was 45 minutes) we went in at 1:10ish and were seated at about 2. The wait time however was not that bad  because they took down my number and my friends and i were able to go window shopping to pass time. Also the waiter also didn't mind splitting our checks 4 ways even though we told her towards the end of the meal which made her job a bit more difficult. Other than the fact that they don't take reservations between 12 and 2, i would highly recommend this location to anyone."
Patti R.,"Duarte, CA",1,6,,5.0,12/2/2013,Service was great. The food was really good. I love their cheesecake. I would definitely go back.
Dayana r.,"Huntington Park, CA",142,68,38,4.0,3/9/2013,"I have been here twice. the wait was not too long which Loved. The food is delicious as well, but the only reason i give it 4 stars is because both times the servers were not that good. I've had better service in a busier environment."
Anonymous A.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,5,,4.0,1/25/2015,Smaller than other locations but very attentive service. We recently celebrated a birthday there and had a surprise dessert and of course they sang for us.
Dan B.,"Pasadena, CA",1,31,58,4.0,9/17/2011,"First of all, DON'T READ THE NUTRITIONAL GUIDE!!! If you do the above you will likely walk right back out of the place and let me tell you, you could be making a boo-boo. They serve a good range of dishes here and the service is usually very good. My standard dish is the four cheese pasta with chicken (1200 calories!) but I've also had a range of their burgers and steaks and my only complaint to date is a waiter thinking I was an air-steward (due to my British accent). If you get here after 7pm be prepared to wait 20 minutes before you are seated, maybe spend the time eyeing the fine selection of cheesecakes they have on display at the front of the 'factory'. I would recommended the Godiva chocolate and the original strawberry cheesecake, but again DO NOT check the calorie content. The prices here are reasonable compared to other surrounding eateries and the portion sizes, while no where near the size of a Maggiano's dish (their full portion spaghetti meatballs comes in a bucket and is 4900 claories - I kid you not, check it out), are still very good. I would recommened eating here if you are in the area, it has not let me down yet."
Patty K.,"Pasadena, CA",131,198,10,4.0,5/12/2012,"This review is for Happy hour only! I think Cheesecake factory has one of the best happy hours in Old Town. They offer several full size appetizers for only $5 and $5 mixed drinks. I usually don't drink because most of the time I'm on my lunch break, but even just the food is a great deal. All of the apps I've tried have been very yummy and usually the service is pretty prompt so I have no problem getting back to work on time."
Amberlin J.,"Pacoima, CA",9,49,2,5.0,3/21/2011,"Oh, wow. Not wow at the chicken piccata or the vanilla bean cheesecake though--wow at the service from JOSH. He checked on us at all the right times, his presentation was spot on, and it made the experience so much more enjoyable no doubt. I didn't have high expectations for the cheesecake factory since it was a saturday night, and it's a chain, but i mean...on all scales, his service is as high as it gets. The food was good--good portion size, tasted alright too. The cheesecake wasn't overbearing, the flavors were subtle overall. I can't wait to try the other kinds of cheesecake! Their selection is so extensive--but of course, it is ""The Cheesecake Factory""!"
G. I.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,13,,1.0,12/4/2014,"Oh, how I used to love the Cheesecake Factory.  Not so much anymore.  I think everyone at the Pasadena location is just dialing it in.  I have a favorite waiter or two but everyone els... meh.  The quality of the food has just gone down the tubes.  On THREE separate occasions, I ordered dishes with RICE in it (Jambalaya with Rice, Orange Chicken, Some Shrimp Dish I can't remember) and the rice was NOT COOKED!!!  The rice was still hard and in it's shell.  The last time I went there, I ordered Orange Chicken with rice.  My meal came out and the rice was NOT cooked.  I sent it back.  They made me wait 25 minutes so they could cook rice.  45 minutes later they brought out my meal again and guess what?  THE RICE WAS HARD AGAIN!! It was not cooked!!  So I was there about1.5 hours and NO MEAL.  INFURIATING.  Also, the restaurant is physically a MESS.  The women's bathroom is CDC gross - no one cleans it, and they always run out of toilet paper and paper towels.  And, the smell??  BLECH!!  The floors of the restaurant are STICKY all the time - do these people CLEAN the floors or any part of the restaurant??  And the booths are filthy - there's always gunk on the booth seats and tables.  I was once at a table and the salt and pepper shakers were on the floor!  YIKES.  Cheesecake Factory Pasadena - You need to STEP IT UP!!  This location is a DISGRACE!"
Wo Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",36,199,93,3.0,5/21/2010,"Ah The Cheesecake Factory, good old place to hang out with friends and family for any occasion.  The food is good, but what is up with the wait times during dinner time.  I really want to go back to you guys at Cheesecake Factory, but you guys make it so tough to even get seated. The good side - 1 star for good food.  My favorite dish is the chicken madera.  A wonderful dish.  2 grilled to perfection chicken breast, asparagus on top, with bacon, with mashed potato on the side with the addicting madera sauce. 1 star for the friendly service.  Staff are nice and the server was knowledgeable about the food.  Thanks for recommending the chicken madera.  I am a fan of that dish for life! 1 star for cheesecake.  Very good cheesecake.  Order if you have room for dessert at the end of the meal. The Dark Side - 0 stars for no validation, bad parking, and wait time.  I have gone to the Pasadena location and the parking lot are always full so I end up parking a mile away around the residential area and hike over to the Cheesecake Factory.  Lastly the wait times.  Each time I have been there the wait time has been anywhere from 45 minutes to an hour.  I even tried to go to the Glendale location, but that was a 1.5 hr wait.  If long wait times are the intended Cheesecake experience, you guys can keep your cheesecake.  I can probably make my own Cheesecake with that amount of wait time. Bon Apettit!"
Missy J.,"Alhambra, CA",167,27,,1.0,7/19/2012,"I've had Cheesecake factory before, and this was definitely the worst experience I've ever had. Service - still exceptional, although the waiter kind of mixed up our food. I can't blame him because we were a group of ~15 people. Food - After careful examine the menu (since I had plenty of time because some of us were running a little late), I was going for either Garlic Noodles or Thai Noodles. But I didn't like Parmasean cheese so I finally settled on Evelyn's Favorite because I thought since this is someone's favorite, it must be good. (This is off their website) The ingredients were: Penne Tossed with Broccoli, Oven-Dried Tomato, Roasted Eggplant, Peppers, Artichoke, Kalamata Olives, Garlic and Pine Nuts). It was a total mistake!! I mean, if this was cooked properly, it could taste better (Note that I didn't say fantastic, but it could be better). The pasta was dry and hard, meaning that the chef was probably felt too rushed with a big group order and had to drain my pasta early - for that the center was still uncooked. The egg plants were burned (not browned, but BURNED)! Come on chefs, don't treat us customers like we are idiots. Although I couldn't see well under the dark lighting inside the restaurant, and my food just looked like a black/white picture taken from an old camera, I have good taste buds and I could definitely taste the burned egg plants. I was being optimistic and thought, maybe it's just one piece, let me try another one. And it was burned as well. In fact, all the eggplants were burned! The pasta was super oily and not to mention the combination of herbs just made this dish a complete failure. For the price (I think it was $13-ish, and after tips ~$18), it was junk!!  Like I said, I've been to Cheesecake Factory a couple times, and the food wasn't good at all. But this Cheesecake factory was the worst of all."
The J's H.,"West Hollywood, CA",28,157,40,4.0,4/18/2011,"Happy Hour Review  Having grown up in the Midwest, I can't help but love chain restaurants. For this reason, an afternoon trip to Pasadena with Nicandrew included a stop at the chain most cited as a portion-control-killing obesity cause, the Cheesecake Factory!! And I get it - their portions are kinda ridiculous. That's why you should just go for Happy Hour, have a fantastic cocktail and a large portion-ed appetizer and be on your merry way! Which is exactly what our crew did. We dropped in at 4pm, when Happy Hour starts and were glad we were just there for Happy Hour since there was a wait for the restaurant. Happy Hour is served at the bar area and at the nearby high-tables. A couple spots cleared at the bar when we arrived so we took a seat and then a few minutes to make a choice on their wicked-crazy food Happy Hour options; for real, so many delish-sounding options between $4-6! The drink choice was a little easier. Besides $5 well drinks, $5 wines by the glass, and $4 select draft beers, they also offer 4 classic cocktails - mojito, Long Island iced tea, margarita, cosmopolitan - and a specialty called J.W.'s Pink Lemonade for only $5. As dorky as it sounds, sometimes it's nice to see the specialty drinks listed out like that. I love Long Island's, but always seem to forget that they're out there waiting to be enjoyed. Seeing it listed on the menu - well, I just had to have one! Nic had a tasty margarita and Drew enjoyed the mojito, which our bartender freshly made right before us. All the drinks were pretty right on, but I think the mojito was my fav. After a starter of their delish white & honey-wheat (I think?) bread, Nicandrew ended up going with the artichoke-crab dip for $5.95 and I had an order of the Avocado Eggrolls served with a tamarind dipping sauce for $5. Being the Cheesecake Factory, the eggrolls were actually three whole eggrolls cut in half - more than enough food for one person! Awesomely good though. So that was the food and drink... The ambiance was kinda what you'd expect - a couple TVs going (1 sports, 1 CNN), a good-sized crowd for 4pm that was a little loud for my tastes. Luckily, and I don't know if it was because we were buzzed, but I swear when they dimmed the lights around 4:30, the crowd got quieter! I say dim lights all the time, baby! All in all, we had a fun time and the chain restaurant Happy Hour didn't disappoint! The only disappointment (and it's kinda major) is that I just don't understand why HH only runs weekdays from 4-6pm. I know people have more flexible schedules in Los Angeles, but all my working friends don't get off work until at least 5:30, so I'll never understand an HH that only lasts til 6, especially if it's weekday only. And for the Cheesecake Factory where Happy Hour is served at the bar-area only, I really don't think a 2-hour weekend HH could hurt business that much. HAPPY HOUR TIMES: Monday-Friday; 4-6pm DRINK DEALS: $5 Specialty Cocktails, well drinks & wines by the glass, $ 15 pitchers of sangria, $10 pitchers of beer, $5 wines by the glass, $4 select draft beers FOOD DEALS: Tons of Food options from $4-6"
Bernard V.,"Monnickendam, The Netherlands",33,327,233,4.0,3/5/2013,"Love this place ... huge portions of food. Everything is oversized here except for the prices. Love, love, love the cake selection! Always fast and friendly service. On the weekend try to avoid the peak hours ... waiting for a table can be long."
Alessandra S.,"South Pasadena, CA",3335,143,281,4.0,11/8/2010,"Love the cheesecake but hold the check!  I love coming here for dates or just to have a simple dinner and drinks with my girlfriends.  The food here is always good and the service is so-so and slow at times.  Don't wait for me to ask you to fill my glass up with water and yes I do want more and I love bread too so keep it coming!   I just recently tried the Louisiana chicken pasta with a spicy ""New Orleans sauce"" per the waitresses recommendation and boy did she hit the nail on the head! Tastiest pasta ever!!!  I'm very happy and can always count on the servers opinion! The wait wasn't that long for a Friday night (about 30 minutes) but overall I enjoyed myself and will go back even though I prefer the Cheesecake Factory at Americana instead. Same service and food just a prettier location and parking is better."
Dana A.,"Rosemead, CA",0,12,6,2.0,10/18/2014,"Came here on a Tuesday night and was seated quickly! Service was alright.. The bread that was brought out was cold and hard, which is not how it should be. We ordered a salmon dish and a pasta, the pasta was not very flavorful and the chicken was dry. I would recommend the Cheesecake Factory in Arcadia over this one!"
