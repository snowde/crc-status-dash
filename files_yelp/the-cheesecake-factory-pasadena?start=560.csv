Eric H.,"San Diego, CA",10,47,3,3.0,12/5/2011,"Food was awesome, I loved the Louisiana Chicken and they gave some great complementary bread and butter. But I got to mark this place down heavily for the service. The waiter was slow and rarely came back to refill our drinks, forgot to get us our condiments, and even our requested to go box. They also sat us outside when it was freezing and at a table that was pretty small and crowded next to another group. The table was also dirty and the menu's had someone elses' food on them. Food: 5-Stars  Service: 1-Star"
Amelia J.,"Pasadena, CA",127,36,7,5.0,1/10/2011,"I love the cheesecake factory!  Artichoke Dip: it's great i don't usually eat artichoke dip because i don't like how it's made in some places but i'll eat here. it's not too creamy or too thick. it's just right and it tastes amazing. cheese burger sliders: i love these! my bf and i always get sliders here and are by the far the best ones we've had.  my favorite dish, caramel chicken: i love this. i'm a big fan of rice. i love the rice that comes with this dish. the chicken is great. crunchy on the outside soft in the inside. i do think they put too much ginger in the veggies which kinda makes the rest of the food taste kind of bitter but other than that, it's great. and last but not least, the cheesecake. I LOVE CHESSECAKE. the original is great. it has the right consistency of cream cheese and of the sweet taste. my all time favorite is the raspberry white chocolate truffle, soooooo amazing. i can eat this all day everyday! overall, the cheesecake factory is great and i will definitely keep coming here!"
Matthew D.,"Echo Park, Los Angeles, CA",8,26,22,5.0,2/19/2013,"My girl and I are regulars at Cheesecake Factory and I must say that we've never been disappointed! After trying more than 85% of the entire menu (including drinks and desserts) they always leave me wanting more. Our last visit was on valentines day (2-14-13) and despite the busy crowd, I must say that I experienced the best service up to date. Very friendly, delicious food and accommodating. Will I be back? Yes, tomorrow!"
Jennifer Y.,"Honolulu, HI",353,470,540,3.0,11/25/2010,"Pleasant staff, average food, it's what you expect from Cheesecake Factory. What you also expect is to get a buzzer upon entry and have a 40-50 minute wait for a table/booth, and to have to wait more for waitservice, food, and then the check and your to-go box(es). Given the quantity of food & fairness of prices, you really can't go wrong, unless you're looking for a quick meal. Dishes to try: # Boston house salad # E's favorite pasta # Herb encrusted salmon # Farfalle with chicken and roasted garlic # Tex-Mex egg rolls Drinks to try: # Green tea, iced and sweetened # Pina colada # Silverlight mojito Cheesecakes to try (of course): # Kahlua choco  # Key lime  # Godiva # Vanilla bean"
Clark C.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",326,28,1,4.0,4/7/2010,"Its called the Cheesecake Factory but I never get the cheesecake here.  I feel like someone who goes to Starbucks Coffee only to order the green tea.   The food is ok here. The best dish is the Mediterranean Mahi Mahi which is probably on the menu but can be ordered upon request.  This place really deserves only 3 stars but it was my girlfriend's favorite restaurant at the time I started dating her so it gets a bonus star. On a side note, the parking in Old town is a hot mess. There is one garage that gives 90minutes free so be on the look out. I think  I got my car keyed in one of those parking structures too! lol good times...."
Dana P.,"North Hills, CA",65,299,28,5.0,11/28/2010,"Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite restaurants...EVER.  I'm a picky eater, so if I can eat more than two things on a menu, you are ok in my book.  This location is now my favorite b/c I have not had to wait to be seated like I have at other locations (though I have been making it a point to come at mostly non-peak hours). Always great service and it's close to my cousin's place.   The only two negatives about this place are: - Waiting area is SUPER TINY.  Come on, Cheesecake Factory Pasadena. That was very poor planning. - If you get seated near the bathroom, people are CONSTANTLY bumping into you while you are trying to eat.  That is pretty annoying."
tonya b.,"Altadena, CA",24,134,9,1.0,2/6/2010,"When you tell your server that your dish was not cooked properly, what is  it exactly that you would expect? To have the server ask if you want to take it home in a box? ummm what part of ""it's not cooked right and the cheese is cold"" do you not understand? I mean if I didn't like it the first time around, perhaps if I took it home with me and looked at it and thought about it I might enjoy it more in a few hours? my quest to find the perfect cheeseburger was waylaid by a stop at the Cheesecake. I brought my roommate here for a roommate date on a gift card. I'm not sure I've ever eaten at a Cheesecake Factory before. And I sincerely hope I never have to again. Beer list, meh. Wines, errr. I suppose there is a reason I am a regular at Smitty's rather than Cheesecake Factory. At any rate, the server said he would take the overcooked miniscule piece of meat to his manager. ok, and to what end? nothing. no refund, no nothing.  Cheeseburger? This was the ""Factory Cheeseburger"". Wow your signature burger is about 1/8;b of overcooked salisbury steak. with a nasty underripe tomato and cold cheddar cheese. I am so nonplussed by my experience, that even though my roomie's dinner was excellent, it matters not. So let's chat about some french fries, shall we? Honestly, when it comes to fried potatoes I am not that picky.  McDonald's makes better fries than Cheesecake Factory.  I mean really, you have like 8 burgers to choose from on your menu, and your fries are not even as good as Ore-Ida.  This is a great place for people who like tons of rich food. Like portions enough to kill an elephant. Unless you order the signature burger, which is all bread, and a speck of meat. Even the tomato is bigger than the meat. Sooooo. Never mind. I am wasting my time even bothering writing so much about this place. Please, I'll pass. If I want dessert, I'm going to POP.  If I want dinner, anywhere but here. Even McDonald's for some fries just so I can remember how good frites taste again. Seriously. OH and they do not validate parking."
Gregory M.,"Los Angeles, CA",26,150,1,2.0,8/17/2010,"A decidedly average restaurant with consistent problems with service. I've eaten at this particular Cheesecake Factory three or four times. And there hasn't been a single time when something didn't go wrong. The time before last I was given a ketchup bottle that exploded when I opened it, covering my hands and shirt with fermented ketchup. Now, in all fairness, they are very apologetic when something is awry and they try to fix it.  But it would be nice if it didn't happen so often. At my most recent visit at around 3:30 on a weekday, I was seated relatively quickly. My waiter took my drink order and, five minutes later, my appetizer and entree order. I then proceeded to wait a good thirty minutes for my appetizer (white bean hummus). When it finally came, it was a bit disappointing...chunky and rather bland. I actually added a good amount of table salt to give it a little bit of flavor. Meh. The burger I ordered came about 20 minutes later. It was the Kobe Beef Burger with Onions and Mushrooms. I ordered it Medium Rare, like I pretty much always do. When it finally came, it was cooked well-done. When the waiter came to check on me, he asked if everything was the way I wanted it and I mentioned the burger being overcooked. He took my plate and and said he would be back soon.  In the meantime, I picked at the really bland salad and refrigerated tomato (note: refrigerating tomatoes is a sin) for a few minutes before a manager came by to apologize. It was certainly a good move, but I was already losing hope of having a decent dining experience. The burger finally came back, in the medium to medium rare range. I ate about 3/4 of the burger before getting my check and heading out. While it was actually cooked properly, it was surprisingly bland and came, like the salad, with a gross, mealy slice of tomato.  For a simple lunch, I ended up being in the restaurant for a good hour and a half.  While there was no exploding ketchup this time and the staff tried to ameliorate the situtation, I really have no interest in returning for more punishment."
Riley B.,"Pasadena, CA",0,12,,5.0,3/12/2011,"Oh, Chicken Madeira, how i love thee! l like the Cheesecake Factory due to its diverse menu, which pleases everyone and the Chicken Madeira, which pleases me.  The sauce is rich and delicious. The chicken is tender and delightful with the melted cheese and mushrooms on top. And, of course, the asparagus and mashed potatoes are always a welcome accompaniment! Plus, since CF always gives enormous portions, I get to satisfy my wicked craving for this dish twice, with the leftovers. Definitely one of my favorite comfort meals ever."
Sarah M.,"Los Angeles, CA",75,69,,3.0,10/11/2010,"Upon reading your review, Joe A., my dining experience here last month makes much more sense.  I found several suspiciously hard morsels in my Weight Management Pear and Endive salad and am now wholly convinced they were small bones.  Also, I'm not a fan of their enormous portions.  I left feeling so full I thought I was going to...die!"
Nadia F.,"Pasadena, CA",95,184,26,5.0,3/2/2010,"I don't understand what all of these prancy queens are bitching about... lines are too long? Burgers aren't made right? They sold your favorite cheesecake? GET OVER IT. You came to a freaking restaurant that is visited by probably 1000 people a day, and you expect them to gourmet make your burger and save a cheesecake for you? Seriously? You're freaking ridiculous. Go run with scissors. The place is FANTASTIC. Theirs salads are unique, the appetizers, the entrees, wraps... everything!! Their food is simply orgasmic!! And I'll choke the next m-f-er who says their cheesecakes aren't the best... are you on crack!?! It's the freaking CHEESECAKE FACTORY! How can their cheesecakes be bland if they sell (AND SELL OUT) daily for $40-$50?!!! Really... some people on yelp need ""buds therapy."" So what you'll have to wait for 15 minutes to be seated? If you don't like that, eat at home. The place is packed because it's GOOD. Not because they are out to piss you off. THE PLACE IS AMAZING. Really. Better than anything else. And yes, their cheesecakes are great, too."
Delilah A.,"West Hollywood, CA",204,14,4,4.0,1/13/2013,"We came to the Cheesecake Factory last night for a 6PM dinner with my mom and her friend from out of town. The wait was longer than their estimated 20 minutes. We were seated at 6:40PM near the door, which was a bit chilly, as people were coming in and out. I would have given this place 3 stars because of the wait and being cold, but since the food was yummy and the service was good, I give it 4 stars! I had not been to a Cheesecake Factory in almost a year and noticed that their Hot Fudge Sundae was about half the size than it usually is. I don't know if it's just at the Pasadena location (since it was my first time here) or if they've downsized their sundae. It was still delicious and the food portion sizes are still consistently HUGE! Overall, had great quality time with family and friends:-)"
Susana A.,"Lynwood, CA",14,33,12,4.0,1/12/2011,"Had the Mediterranean mahi- mahi (so delicious), cheesecake (chocolate raspberry truffle) and a brain numbing raspberry martini."
Forthe W.,"Madison, WI",1,66,1,5.0,9/14/2014,"First time visiting the Cheesecake Factory. The place was crowded when we arrived on a Friday night around dinner time, but were seated quickly. Wait staff were fast and attentive. The menu is enormous!! It was more like a book, with at least 12 pages of food that I can recall. Food was great and arrived cooked to our specifications. All in all a good restaurant...my only reservation with eating here often is there isn't much on the menu that is lacking in calorie count, so I'd reserve it for special occasions!"
Marquis M.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,6,6,5.0,5/14/2013,"Love this restaurant . Everyone complains about the wait on the weekends, but dont eat there if you don't want to wait. They don't make you stay once you walk thru the doors. And one must know that a Friday or Saturday night in old town is going to be packed. That's why you go during the weekdays during lunch (1-4pm) or Monday nights.  My favorite dish is the shrimp scampi. It's 20$ but well worth it. Another fav is the chicken bellagio. It feeds two people and its only 14$. I love the happy hour menu. It's better then most. I love me some fried Mac n cheese for only 5$. We all know the cheesecakes are delicious but my two favorite desserts aren't cheesecakes at all. A must have is their strawberry shortcake!!!! And their lemoncello cake. It's mouth watering.  Again I love this location because of the service and skilled servers. The last time I was there our server had two large and very unnecessary demanding parties along with us and every need was met by our server or another staff member. people tend to forget that your not their only table and they must deal with other guest who are a pain in the ass (from what I witnessed last visit).  Anyways I love coming here. Everyone is usually very friendly. Yeah it's corporate but what other restaurant comes out with new dishes every 6 months!?!? They always keep surprising me. =D"
Kat M.,"Los Angeles, CA",883,435,9,1.0,11/18/2011,i hate this place... hate chains why are you people waiting in line to eat this crap? its not even cheap even if someone else was paying...i refuse to eat here...waste of my stomach space..full stop!!!
Michelle N.,"Pasadena, CA",150,81,37,2.0,5/18/2012,"I rather go to Applebee's or something.  I didn't think the food was spectacular.  My waiter was kind of a dick.  My boyfriend's steak (i know, i know, who orders a steak at the cheesecake factory..) was super duper fat!! i think it was 40% fat!  Their bread was realllllllllly good though!"
Alexis R.,"Los Angeles, CA",325,100,7,1.0,3/20/2014,"ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE SERVICE I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE!!!!!! AND IN LA. Let me start off with my story. I have grown up eating at this same restaurant as a child. I tried this location once with a friend we went hiking and were starving. We are both in shape and take care of ourselves. So I ordered a pasta dish and water as my friend did. then we decided fuck it lets get a desert since I have not had one in forever the entire time the waitress came over she was giving me fat comments how i eat a lot, how my stomach is huge and how i eat a lot and calling me fat the entire time!!!!! I was like wow. I told the manger how insulting it was and how I used to model in LA and have worked with a lot of people in the industry im sorry but really??? I am not 1000 Lbs !!!!!! to be calling me fat. I am in shape and not even fat! the girl was a total idiot bitch and thought it was funny and then the bitch was trying to tell me not to eat any meat on the menu because meat is bad for you she was a total extreme vegan freak so  then why in the hell do you work in a restaurant half the menu here is MEAT. fucking idiot I lost it on the manger it was so insulting!!!!! Iv never had that ever happen in my life of resturants!!!!!!!!"
Deborah S.,"Diamond Bar, CA",0,5,,5.0,8/13/2014,"My guy and I are literally walking out of this place right now, and I couldn't wait to write a review. We sat at the bar on a Wed, had THE BEST service we both have ever agreed we'd ever had at ANY 5 star restaurant. Josh the bartender and his co-worker whom we didn't get a chance to get his name(08.13.14, slightly shorter than josh). I've worked at a cheesecake before, and do not know these ppl whatsoever. But I know good service due to my experience. They worked as a team, again, best service we've ever had on our lives. Then upon leaving, we decided on a cheesecake. Daniel in the bakery was almost just as good as the bartenders. We couldn't decide from 3 cheesecakes. He helped us to narrow it down to 2. Then upon deciding on one, he gave us a taste of the one we never tried and were debating o n. Now, we will not only only choose that particular cheesecake, but we have decided that we will never go to any other cheesecake factory other than this one ever Again. Thank you Josh the Bartender, this fellow bartender, and Daniel the baker!"
Emily M.,"Arcadia, CA",116,186,1,4.0,7/27/2010,"All I can say is... FRIED MACARONI AND CHEESE. I don't care of this shit gives me a heart attack... it's worth it!!! Don't knock it until you've tried it! I also love Fettuccine with Chicken and Sun-dried Tomatoes. It's not too heavy, really flavorful, and the sun-dried tomatoes give it an extra kick of sweetness. Santa Fe salad is good but dressing kind of smells like BO. Cheesecakes are pretty good, obviously however can be VERY sweet and only enjoyable in small quantities. Also, it's alarming now that they post the calorie counts... some of the slices of cake are costing you two days worth of calories. Ewww.... but i'll splurge on the fried mac & cheese."
