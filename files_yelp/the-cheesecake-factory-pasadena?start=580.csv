Ashlee T.,"South El Monte, CA",73,84,5,2.0,12/29/2012,They are always busy and so tired of waiting to get seat!  I love their Calamari and cheese cakes! Mini bites are good too.
Jon T.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,59,2,4.0,12/27/2012,Consistently good food and service.  As anyone who has been here knows there can be a bit of a wait to get seated at times.  Be sure to try the crab & cream cheese fried won tons.  Be sure to park in the city owned structure across the street where you got 90 minutes free parking.
Colin B.,"Pasadena, CA",66,17,1,4.0,12/17/2010,"I have been there a few times so, I decided it was a good time to review. I agree with Kevin that you can take mostly anyone there and the fact that's it pretty close to my house doesn't hurt either. Just try and avoid busy nights (Fri and Sat). Service is decent and food is really good. Maybe not the most helpful review in the world but it's worth going. Try the fries (who would expect them to be so great?) and the jambalaya pasta :)"
Louie F.,"Santa Barbara, CA",182,291,80,4.0,7/1/2010,"I must say, the worst part about eating at the Cheesecake Factory (any location), is figuring out what to order. The menu is huge and the advertisements abundant. I'm not sure if I should order the Navajo sandwich or a diamond watch! In any event, I've never had a bad meal here. The dinner bread they serve is delicious and usually steaming hot when it arrives to your table. The avocado egg rolls are by far the standard I compare all other restaurants too.  I've had many entrees from the menu, but the the Chicken & Biscuits has to be my favorite by far. The chicken is tender and moist while the biscuits are fluffy. However, the magic really happens when they dump gravy over the entire dish! Now we're talkin!  Now to the dessert...the item that gives this restaurant its name. The cheesecake here is so creamy and rich that you find yourself planning the rest of your meal around having room for dessert. Although most of the time, my eyes are bigger than my stomach and I end up taking the cheesecake to go -- makes an excellent breakfast too FYI."
Katie B.,"San Jose, CA",41,150,,4.0,7/27/2012,I normally do not eat at or review chain restaurants but the Happy Hour deals are pretty great. The appetizers are HUGE and they are all only 5 bucks! I would only recommend coming here for Happy Hour if you are in the area and looking for a good deal. You must sit in the bar area though to get the HH pricing.
Anabelle E.,"Hollywood, CA",143,39,22,4.0,3/6/2006,I love going to this place!  Always fun and a great stmosphere!  Very trendy!  You can get drinks at the bar while you wait for a table.  The wait is pretty long if you just walk in.  Although a select few dont ever wait. The food always tastes great and is always in large portions.  Recently tried there buffolos wings covered in a crispy fried wrapped and I have to say there were GREAT!   And of course their cheesecake list goes on forever.  Every single one that I have tried has been the best ever!!  A must have when you come to the cheesecake factory!!
Justin N.,"Alhambra, CA",42,44,,5.0,5/20/2013,"Went to breakfast here on Sunday morning.  They just had there annual Ferrari Car Show, which was awesome.  Ordered their farm fresh eggs with potatoes, honey bacon and white toast.  The breakfast was delicious.  The price's are a little more that other restaurants like IHOP.  But, the portions are huge and the meals all come with complimentary bread.  The house coffee that I ordered was hot and fresh as well.  A lot better than most breakfast places.  This review is for breakfast only.  Also the good thing about this location is that you get 90 min free parking at the garage across the street."
Kevin L.,"San Gabriel, CA",16,1,,5.0,12/17/2010,The cheesecake factory in Pasadena is a nice place to go to with family friends or even a date. It was my first time there with a friend of mine after we went Christmas shopping down the street and i have to say i was pretty impressed. We arrived around 3:30pm on a wednesday and were seated immediately by their hostess that was super friendly and chose a seat nearby the window. only down side is that if you sit near the windows people who walk around look at you and see what you're eating!! Our waiter was Gustavo and service couldnt have been better. he introduced us to the menu cause obviously i was completely lost to the million things they had on their menu. my friend and i were only there for dessert so he told us that the red velvet cheesecake is the most popular so i decided to get that and my friend got the chocolate fudge cheesecake and it was REALLY good. i also rate service on how well they notice you and by that i mean beverage refills. if they notice that you're low on your drink and they refill it doesnt that mean whenever you need something they'll be right there? this guy refilled my water when i drank it barely 3/4s of the way!!! great service will return soon.
Sett E.,"Los Angeles, CA",106,57,15,4.0,5/16/2011,Always crowded but always good food.  I love going to cheesecake and Pasadena location is one of my favorites! Friendly service and food never disappoints. Yum!
Nick V.,"Sierra Madre, CA",41,160,32,5.0,7/30/2010,"LOVE IT!   MUST TRY!! The salsbary steak plate! it was honestly the best I've ever had in my life, no joke and I think I have pretty good taste in food.  The mash potatoes are very good too.  They came with green beans also.  The price was a little hefty but totally worth it. 12.99.   Girlfriend's pasta was yummy.  She got the chicken fetticini with sundried tomatos which was 15 bucks.  All together we had a great time, good atmosphere and AWESOME SERVICE~!  The wait wasnt that long for 2 people.  Our waitress was awesome she looked like lucy liu  Will be back very soon!"
Soo C.,"Kensington, MD",64,103,3,4.0,10/1/2012,Ok. So I'm typically not a fan of the chain restaurants but they have a $5 happy hour special for some apps and drinks and it's very much worth while!  The service was awesome and the drinks were delicious!  Check out the Pasadena CCF for a reasonably priced happy hour.
Lisa H.,"Santa Clarita, CA",342,16,6,2.0,5/22/2015,"We dined in here last night for my sisters' birthday, her choice. We usually go to Sabor in Valencia but she wanted to change it up. We got sat at a table in the main dining room right under the air conditioning vent. I asked if we could move to the table a few feet away that wasn't directly under the vent. Our server made a comment how he was so hot and that this was the best he could do. Put off and clearly unsettled, he finally gave in and ""let us"" move showing it bothered him that we would no longer be in his section. I might add, that if u want to consider being a ""fine dining"" restaurant, its the little things that make your experience exceptional. At this point, we are all bothered. The next server came, a girl, who seemed nice but really cared about her job. She cared more about carding me (26) my mom (55) and dad (49) than being down to earth and personable. I was very put off by this, I find it disrespectful to ask the clearly older adults for their ID's. She even craned her neck around to make sure I was who my ID said I was even though I pulled my card right out of my ID slip of my wallet. Now I get it, I've worked at yard house and understand where you are getting at with service, but its clearly obvious you are force feeding us the same detailed description of an appetizer, entree and dessert. I would rather have someone wait on us that is going to have somewhat of a pulse, a personality. Dinner was good, I got the chicken madiera (which is pronounced ma-dare-ah) my server corrected me.... Anyways, the cheesecake factory gets two stars because the servers are so drilled to be perfect that they forgot what true service is. The little things, the personable behavior, the light connections made with the guest. They fall short because they care so much about ""guest perception"" that they lose the fundamentals. They try so hard to ""be perfect"" and look, they have 3 stars. See what happens when you try way too hard?"
Sal V.,"Los Angeles, CA",96,59,,4.0,8/1/2014,"we were here earlier tonight for a nephew's birthday celebration. we had a big group at 6pm. nevertheless we didn't have to wait very long. our server was Josh, a very nice, attentive and helpful waiter. he helped us with our request for separate checks with no problems. Thank you Josh. you made it a good experience for all of us."
Cintya P.,"La Quinta, CA",190,441,517,3.0,6/29/2010,"First time I've been to The Cheesecake Factory. Okay, here I go....  The waiting area seems to be too small and became crowded and people were trying to order a cheesecake and had to fight their way to the register. The hostess underestimated the waiting time; yet, they were friendly :). The waiter was nice and I liked his service. This made the dining experience very delightful, especially that I was with two wonderful friends.  I really enjoyed the bread they brought us to keep our hunger tamed. I would of, however, preferred if the bread was pre-sliced. Margarine spread? I prefer butter hehe. The ""Tex-Mex Egg Rolls"" were okay, they could of added some black beans and more corn and some roasted poblano chiles. Oh, they could of accompanied it with a roasted tomato-tomatillo-cilantro salsa. The avocado dip was a little bland. The Garlic Noodles dish was good. I really liked the idea of having some shiitake mushrooms with asparagus and oven-roasted tomatoes and Parmesan. I tried my friend's Fried Zucchini dish with ranch and I believe there could be a great improvement! Why ranch? Ranch is just so plain! Why not a BBQ Ranch dressing or a lemon ranch with cilantro dressing? Or or or ahhh the possibilities.  Overall, I would go again to try the cheesecake loll. The other food, not so much :0.  That fellow Yelpers is my Cheesecake Factory experience."
Dan D.,"Encino, CA",39,130,3,2.0,5/18/2010,"6 years ago, I ordered something from this restaurant that came with ""wasabi mashed potatoes"". It made gustatory history for me. No words could describe how good it was. 2 years ago, I remembered that dish, and planned my birthday party around going to a DIFFERENT cheesecake factory, and ordering the same dish. Not all locations are the same! No words could describe my morose. Final verdict: 5-stars for how the restaurant lives in my memory, 2-stars for how it is to me now..."
Jimmy D.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,28,5,4.0,9/15/2012,"COme in its Cheescake factory, solid food and usually prompt service. Very consistent"
Glenn M.,"Long Beach, CA",14,8,,1.0,12/23/2012,"We had our hospital department holiday gathering on December 20th. It was ruined because of the ineptness of the manager and staff who despite a reservation, our party was separated because they sat a party in the tables reserved for us. This party could have been offered at any of the empty tables.  The excuse the manager  gave us was inadequate and full of bull.   What makes matter worse, we never received a single apology.   We will never go back, suggest readers do not, they do not give a hoot about their  customers."
Tanya P.,"Montebello, CA",16,12,5,5.0,7/31/2012,Went today and had my usual chicken costallete and tried the mango key lime cheesecake... It was AMAZING... Great compliment of flavors... Service was great!
Kim N.,"South Bay, CA",2945,9796,55587,4.0,7/21/2006,"I haven't officially had a full meal here but I'm betting good money  that the food is exactly the same as the other ones. Talk about consistency in formula. However what makes a cheesecake factory different from one to the next is the locale, ambiance and people. Great locale in Old Town Pasadena.   My ex-gf and I however did have cheesecake and Guinness after watching fireworks from town instead of going to the Rosebowl. Hit the  spot for late night  booze and munchies."
Nancy V.,"Tujunga, CA",2,10,,4.0,2/5/2013,Yummy food as usual. Our dinner came too fast after our appetizer. I miss the Godiva chocolate cheesecake
