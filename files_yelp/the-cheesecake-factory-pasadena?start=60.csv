T L.,"Arcadia, CA",1,9,,2.0,5/19/2017,"It was not long of a wait so my boyfriend and I decided to stay for dinner. We got seated pretty quickly. Our server came and took our drinks and appetizer. After we got our drinks it took 30mins for her to come back and take our order, and at this time we still haven't gotten our crab bites appetizer!! We waited a little longer and still nothing !!! People who sat and ordered the same time we did, had gotten their appetizers and was getting their food as we waited and had enough we got up and wanted to leave!!! The manager just said she'll comp our crab bites that we're nowhere to be found, but we were tired of waiting so we left and paid for our drinks.  Totally disappointment knowing how they treated us. I'm more upset cause it's also a celebration for my son birthday.a lot so when we have a date night it's rare and we don't have much time left that we can go out as much. So to me, this was all such a bummer and such bad service and such a waste of time !!!"
Christian M.,"Santa Monica, CA",0,1,1,5.0,8/17/2017,This was my first time here and I can honestly say I'm going to be coming back for this dish real soon! This Hibachi Steak was amazing and I'm craving for it once again.
Sunny H.,"Monterey Park, CA",14,17,46,3.0,6/5/2017,"I have to say, I do have better experience with this place before. Last week, I ordered a Pasta Da Vinci and Thai Wrap. The Thai Lettuce Wraps were great since the fresh lettuce went really well with the nice seasoned chicken strip and other ingredients. The pasta normally don't disappoint me, and the chicken were cooked well and soft, the pasta was not bad or meat was not dry at all. The Big Part should be the all famous Cheesecake, correct? Turn out, this was a big disappointment. The crust on the cake bottom was thin and wet, and I am pretty sure I have better cheesecake before. At the end, even the strawberry short cake was better than the cake. Although the server was alright, I think I might prefer their Arcadia location next time."
Emily G.,"South Pasadena, CA",3,25,93,2.0,4/21/2017,Went here for my friends birthday and told the waiter. He asked us if we wanted a sundae or a slice of cake. We order a cake and then he later tries to charge us for thew cake. He says that the cake is not free but the sundae is. I don't think the customers can assume that the sundae is free and the cake isn't when they give you an option bwtween the two. I had a horrible experience here. And the waiter was so rude and made me pay an extra $8.
Lore D.,"Glendale, CA",6,51,,3.0,5/5/2017,"It's a long story, but Hubs and I ended up with $100.00 worth of gift certificates to the Cheesecake Factory. Hence, the following review. Every store in this chain has seemed overly ""grand"" IMHO, and this one is no exception.  The aftetnoon we lunched there we witnessed no less than three birthday parties. This is clearly a popular spot for the office workers of Old Town.  We were seated quickly in a nice cozy booth. Our server was professional and efficient. Hubs and I were confused by the three (3) menus with their numerous and often redundant choices. I found the caloric values of the dishes to be discouraging and off-putting, to say the least. I don't want to be told that the fish and chips is 1800 calories. I don't want a guilt trip or a Weight Watchers lecture from a restaurant whose stock-in-trade is cheesecake, for crying out loud.  WTF is this anyway? Might as well have a disclsimer saying ""welcome fatsos, to our fattening emporium of fatty fatness,  and now for a very special episode of ""My 600 lb Life"" We started with the famous avocado egg rolls, which were amazing and disappeared quickly. Hubs ordered the Seared Ahi plate, which was fundamentally the same thing as my Tuna Tataki salad. Both dishes were en pointe, tasty and surprisingly filling, considering the relative lowness of their respective caloric values.  Both entrees were priced around $20.00, and with our gift certificates,  were an even better value at free. At this point in the meal, our server went on break. The guy covering for her was pretty douchey. I didn't appreciate him trying to take our bread away. By all means, clear our table but first ask if we're done with something before you just yank it away. Manners! You know how I love me some bread. Douchey substitute server also delivered my Fresh Strawberry Cheesecake  without a fresh, clean fork. Or any fork for that matter. Lucky for me that I still had a clean spoon left. Hubs used his remaining fork to help me polish off the dessert, which was creamy, dense, and luscious as cheesecake should be. I love me some cheesecake. Sigh. In all, the food was very, very good, albeit somewhat expensive, despite not having ordered any adult beverages. Thank goodness for the gift certificates."
Carol C.,"Los Angeles, CA",103,14,6,1.0,10/22/2017,"My husband and I LOVE Cheesecake Factory but we really dislike this location due to their lack of customer service. We only came here because we were in the area. Never again! 1. The young man who walked us to our table gave me the dirtiest look after I decline the table. I requested a bench 2. Waiter forgot to bring my coffee, forgot my husbands orange juice 3. Never received my son's fruit. Service was slow and I can hear all the employees goofing around in the kitchen. Never returning to this cheesecake location."
Phillip L.,"Studio City, CA",5,8,,5.0,8/23/2017,"Always a great experience at The Cheesecake Factory but I wanted to commend our waitresses, Maria and Astrid. So polite, cheerful, professional with all smiles all the time. Great service, great food, never disappointed! Thank you Maria and Astrid for making our lunch even more delightful!"
Reba Joyce L.,"Riverside, CA",245,46,10,5.0,5/20/2017,"We came here as a group of colleagues during a conference week and were really impressed by the service! I wish I remembered our servers names, but although we had one main server, I feel like the team of women working that night all checked in on us at some point.  The manager also stopped by to make sure that we were ""being taken care of"".  With the kind of company I was with, our conversations were pretty lengthy and work-related, but I feel like we were never interrupted even though there were many times that a server came over to our table. They were also really engaging with what we ordered and made suggestions as well.  I stuck to my usual: Chicken Picatta and Avocado Egg Rolls. The cheesecake slice that I took home is usually the Reese's one, but my peanut butter craving this time was fulfilled by the server's suggestion: (darn, I don't remember the full name) Adam's ____ something? This location takes the (cheese)Cake!"
Jack H.,"Los Angeles, CA",756,493,2422,5.0,8/30/2016,"I wanted to take the kids out a little and I'm realizing that Cheesecake Factory is now my favorite place to take them... Why...??  Well, I get to enjoy a nice environment with my little cutie pies AND eat their food!!!  LOL.  Unfortunately, my little ones have taken after their father and are extremely picky eaters (my wife totally despises me for it lol).  So, being that they are picky eaters and one of them can't really talk yet, I come up with a master plan to buy four different kids meals for all of us to share... typically I'll choose two really good/healthy ones like grilled chicken and grilled salmon and two not so healthy ones (which of course are the ones we all love) like mac n cheese, spaghetti, or pizza.  So our table has a bunch of random plates of different foods along with the bread...  Thankfully when we came to this location the waitress was really sweet.  She totally knew how chaotic it could be with three kids and no adult (I'm the third kid, lol)... And she totally took care of us!!  Oddly enough my youngest ONLY eats the complimentary brown oat bread sticks out of all four plates that I order.  My daughter usually finishes a good half a plate and the rest is for daddy to take down.... Yay for me!  Out of all the cheesecake factory's that I've been to, I have to say that this is one of the better ones.  I don't know if the waitress has kids and understands or not, but she was on point with getting me exactly what I needed when I asked for it.  Many other cheesecake factory's that I've been to just don't understand that kids only have a small time span until they start getting crazy and the only thing on the table to play with is forks and knives (for those that are worried... dont worry... I supervise them while they play with forks and knives!  LOL j/k).  Honestly, compared to other cheesecake factory's, our waitress at this location was great, she brought out the food quickly, she brought our more bread when I mentioned that my little one only likes their bread and on top of great service, their food is great!! (even for a kids meal!! LOL).   Overall, I'd definitely come back here.  If I were to compare this cheesecake factory to BJ's down the street, Cheesecake Factory totally is the winner.  Come by this location and I'm pretty sure you'll be very happy!"
Joe T.,"Temecula, CA",0,465,44,3.0,4/12/2017,"A little different ambiance than other CCF's, probably due to this being inside of an existing old building and not built out to the normal CCF specs, but it all worked. Don't be in a rush, service is slow.  Our wait staff changed during our visit and the 2nd guy was far better than the first (who just had zero personality and zero attention span).  The first guy asked us about 6 times in 5 minutes if we knew what we wanted - really?  You have a novel for a menu, give us a few minutes man. It's a cheesecake factory.  Usually always ok."
Hieu N.,"Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA",1,6,1,4.0,4/17/2017,"Good place for dinner :)  I had meatball pasta there and it was a little too salty for my taste. I asked for parmesan cheese, the waitress brought out a big chunk and started shredding some for me, she said I could stop her when i think that's enough cheese, and she just stopped unexpectedly without asking me.  I like the drink there though, maybe i'll just go back for a drink or something."
Miss B.,"Los Angeles, CA",13,274,347,1.0,3/31/2017,"They need to bring back the ORIGINAL Oreo cheesecake. This thing they are calling Oreo cheesecake is the worst thing I've ever had! There's no Oreo, there's no cheesecake, just hardened chocolate mousse like substance, marshmallow, chocolate cake, and a bunch of other junk. The worst!"
Diana J.,"Altadena, CA",0,15,8,5.0,10/14/2017,"Never been a fan of this chain but this location is fantastic. The food was amazing, service very good. I had herb roasted chicken with potatoes and vegetables and it was cooked to perfection. I dined during a weeknight, I would imagine weekends are very busy so be prepared to wait during peak times as it is located right in the heart of beautiful old town Pasadena."
Zsadé R.,"Panorama City, Los Angeles, CA",78,30,55,5.0,8/18/2017,Oh my gossssshhhh!! Love love love their plain cheesecake and specially their tiramisu cheesecake. Will definitely come back!
Ivy C.,"Chicago, IL",118,13,3,4.0,10/13/2017,Can't really ever go wrong with Cheesecake Factory. Went on a Friday night and surprisingly only had to wait 10 mins too if even that. The food was always good and of course you have to have the bread.
Lynn Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,8,4,3.0,9/28/2017,I can't believe they got rid of the luau salad!!! It was my favorite menu for over a decade :( please bring it back!!!
Rena H.,"Woodland Hills, CA",971,792,4678,5.0,1/15/2016,"Just by writing this review, I want to go to Cheesecake Factory for dinner tonight!!!! It's been a long while since I've been to Cheesecake Factory and every time I go, I always love it.  Without skipping a beat, my friend and I always order the following: Chicken Marsala with Mushrooms: I just love everything about this dish,  from the tender juicy chicken to the sweet marsala/mushroom sauce.   Chinese Chicken Salad: This is the ""it"" salad for me at Cheesecake.  They have tons of other delicious salads but this is the one for me. This location can get really crowded and parking is not that fun but if all that bothers you, just think of getting a slice of the Vanilla Bean cheesecake for dessert and it will melt all your stress away."
Reiko R.,"Pasadena, CA",63,3,,1.0,3/12/2017,Hello a couple of days ago it was early close to 11 me and my boyfriend were looking for a place to dine so we chose the cheesecake factory but were very turned off by such loitering in front of the establishment and such very rude panhandling I just wasn't very comfortable with all the loitering and  smell and rudeness I would say so we decided not to eat there we actually went to a place called  White horse which is amazing you should go I really had an amazing time there and the food is great and there's no one loitering outside of their business which made me very comfortable and is very convenient and affordable and I really appreciated their services   and such beautiful Decour I felt like royalty  Reiko
Christina L.,"East Los Angeles, CA",10,14,22,4.0,3/22/2017,"It's my first time eating Cheesecake Factory, I've heard so many wonders from it from a good friend of mine that we decided to come here on a Friday. It did not take long to be seated, we went in at around 4:20 and seated immediately. We got window seats which was splendid. My only down side is the utensils were dirty and so was our table. Besides that, I ordered the four cheese pasta with chicken, I was able to make it a lunch plate so that's a plus. The pasta was delicious and the bread they offer was amazing as well! I also ordered an original cheesecake which I might add didn't strike me to be all that good, I've definitely tasted better. The only reason I give them a four star is due to the dirty table and utensils, besides that service was amazing and I can't wait to go back!"
Paige M.,"Los Angeles, CA",67,198,437,4.0,2/14/2017,One of my favorite place Got here early so we didn't wait for so long on Valentine's Day. Love Chinese chicken salad! Steak was great! Juicy and tender.
