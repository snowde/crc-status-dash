Soraya S.,"La Crescenta-Montrose, CA",4,96,7,5.0,10/17/2012,"I love cheesecake so much. One of my favorite restaurants, love the big portions and how easy it is to share with someone :) I love ordering pick foods so that's a plus with all their appetizers and small plate options. For lunch I always get the pasta de Vinci or herb crusted salmon. Pasta de Vinci is penne pasta with sweet mushroom sauce and chicken, herb crusted salmon comes with asparagus and mashed potatoes so good. The shrimp scampi has become a new favorite of mine as well! You can't forget the avocado egg rolls to start with. Mhhmm delic"

Tina N.,"Los Angeles, CA",2231,326,1248,5.0,2/19/2010,"The best in pasadena people... You have to make reservations for weekends... usually booked... by the way! You have to try the new appetizers such as the fried zucchini, lettuce wrap is #1, avocado egg rolls, chicken tenders and much more... but if your craving a little bit of curry...try the Bang Bang Chicken & Shrimp! Its a must have! You will love it! A+ 5 Stars"
JJ W.,"Brentwood, CA",62,186,4,5.0,7/30/2010,I am not gonna lie I came here for the 1.50 Cheesecake. I did have some coffee to wash it down. The coffee was nice and strong if that is how you like it. I also noticed it was fair trade.   I would have gotten something to eat but that would have meant that I would not be able to to eat the enjoy my cheesecake as the portions here tend to run on the ginormous side. Bang for  your buck here with the exception of the cheesecake which runs on the expensive side in my opinion unless you share with someone. Hmmm... I am thinking about the upside down pineapple and the Reese's pieces.
Ashley C.,"Henderson, NV",14,35,,4.0,7/17/2012,"Last Saturday was lovely and spent in Old Towne Pasadena-Just the little one and I...I do not know the name of the street but there is a parking structure nestled near the Pottery Barn (there is a pizza place right there) Parking is $6 but its really easy to get in and out of and its centrally located. I digress... We walked around a bit and it was more crowded than I expected due to it being nearly 95 degrees that afternoon...We got severely over heated and I was just looking for a place with some air conditioning where we could sit down for a bit. Alas, Cheesecake Factory!! I love this place in general but I have never eaten at this location before. I was afraid there would be a wait (It was about 4:30 pm) but luckily we were seated immediately at one of the 2 seater booths that look out onto Colorado. We truly enjoyed the people watching as we sipped our drinks ( Me: Kim Crawford Savignon Blanc- Her: Lemonade in a kids cup) I really couldnt decide what to eat because it was kind of between lunch and diiner. Finally I decided on the skinnylicious Veggie Burger- When it came out it had mayo on it which I was surprised by since it is the ""skinny"" version but its all good. And the veggie burger was just that....quite good!! It was made with beets and I love love love beets!! Never had a veggie burger made from beets before... I must say though...that the beets gave the burger a strange reddish color and I couldnt help but think that onlookers who did not know it was a veggie burger must have been grossed out as it looked like I was eating very undercooked hamburger. Our waitress was nice; she seemed kinda new but was more than pleasant and even refilled our kids cup with diet coke for me to send us on our way back out to the heat. All in all...good meal, good service, good day...would go back.  P.S- There are alot of great restaurants in Old Towne so if there is a huge wait at Cheesecake, go check out what else the city has to offer!! Everything is within walking distance!!"
Lisa S.,"Long Beach, CA",1309,1836,312,3.0,5/21/2007,"I'm already not the biggest fan of the Cheesecake Factory.  My friends used to drag me to the one in Redondo Beach after dances like Winter Formal and Valentine Royalty.  My friend and I once had a fight with our dates about who would pay the tab (the guys wanted to pay for us, and she insisted that she pay her own way, because she was an independent girl who would not take charity from any man, and because I was young and impressionable, I followed suit).  We ended up leaving a $50 tip, because everyone paid (the guys for themselves and us, and us for us).   How stupid.   Now that I'm older and much, much wiser, I wouldn't dream of denying a man the satisfaction of paying the bill.  Hey, I welcome it.  Come on guys...I don't say no. Anyways, now that that little plug is out there....I had a bowtie pasta dish at the one in SF, which has a wonderful view from the balcony (making it about worth it) that tasted like crap.  Diego and I went at the Block after the last Harry Potter, and he loves the place.  He swears by the chicken chop, which honestly, wasn't all that bad. So, Saturday night, we're in the car and we can't figure out where to eat, when suddenly, Diego yells out ""CHICKENNNN CHOOOOOOPPP!!!""  I'm like, dude, calm down, and we proceed to Pasadena. So the wait is ridiculous.  It was 6-something, and the girl says 10 to 20 minutes, which is okay, except I hear people mumbling around me that it's 10 to 20 minutes their ass and that they've been waiting more like 30-40 minutes.   This is not a good sign, because we have somewhere to be by 8, but I think we have enough time, and regardless, Diego is out parking the car and I forgot my cellphone in the passenger seat. After about 30 minutes we get seated.  Lo and behold, there is no longer any chicken chop.  So that was the ultimate disappointment of the century for Diego.  After crying for a good ten minutes, he ordered the chicken and biscuits, which were only okay, and I got the chicken medallions, which were dry and stuck to the hot plate.  The spinach was literally dessicated against the white plate as though a leaf pressed in a book.  Blah.  Moreover, it took them ALMOST AN HOUR to give us our food.  This was totally ridiculous, especially since we were in a rush.  I wanted to order dessert, but we just didn't have the time. Oh, and Diego knocked his water over, and this manager lady was all over us, apologizing up the ying yang for like five minutes.  Then, when Diego explained it was his own fault, *poof* she was like ""see ya!"" and left.  I thought that was lame. Probably won't come back here anytime soon, especially since Diego's menu item has been extricated.  I absolutely adore their white chocolate raspberry cheesecake, but you can get that frozen at Costco, along with three other flavors (12 slices total) for $20, so it's no biggie."
Anne M.,"Pasadena, CA",15,194,404,4.0,4/23/2010,"Oh, I thought I wouldn't like this place but I was wrong.  I loved what I ordered and enjoyed their service.  Got the carne asada skirt steak and I love it.  Oh man - can't get enough of their honey wheat bread and the waitress is good enough to give us a bunch of it.  That is just great."
Argie M.,"South Gate, CA",178,326,860,5.0,3/11/2010,"OK so I have been here once but can not wait to go back . I made a mistake and ordered a lot of stuff when me and my boyfriend came here and the bill came out to 97 bucks ouch! But we enjoyed every part of our meal including the free bread you get when you sit down LOL.  So here is what we got we ordered the crab cakes which the waiter said were oh so good and yup he was right on the money there also my BF wanted to try there ricotta and Italian sausage pizza it is small but was very tasty. We had lemonade to drink, free refills YAY. for the main course he had well I can recall what it is called but it was green pasta with two chicken breasts and prosciutto and arugula salad on top enough to feed two people and then some  I had the jambalaya pasta cost 16.99 and man its a whole Lotta pasta. Honestly we were beyond stuffed at this point but hello you can not come here and leave with out trying the cheesecake so we both ordered two different ones I had the red velvet cheesecake and he had the snickers cheesecake we also took one to go for the sister. and we had two hot drinks with that dessert. See what I mean we went over board. Next time we skip the appetizers, share a plate and slit a cheesecake. Final verdict great food, good service, a little pricey but not compare to other restaurants in old town this is a bargain so come one down try it at least ones or just come in for the Cheesecake I am a sucker for sweets."
Laura R.,"Whittier, CA",6,117,1,4.0,3/6/2012,"I love the Cheesecake Factory.  They have a really extensive food and dessert menu.  They give large portions and everything consistently tastes great. There is always a line @ this location, but it moves really quickly and you can look at the menus while you wait.  Awesome desserts!!!! Never had a bad meal or bad service here. Keep up the good work!!!"
Claudia R.,"Milford, CT",93,677,2,4.0,1/25/2010,"Came here friday night and I've never been seated so fast at a Cheesecake Factory!  It was still raining a little so I'm sure that had a lot to do with it. Our waiter was great!  He knew the menu and was super helpful.  We had the avocado eggrolls for an appetizer -- I love these so much it's ridiculous.  I also had the 4 cheese pasta which also was delicious!  Of course it was huge and I took most of it home.  They weren't kidding about the cheese...there was a ton on it.  My date got some sort of chicken finger plate.  There was also a ton and he took most of it home, too. I've never been disappointed by a Cheesecake Factory.  Keep up the great work!"
Nicole C.,"Los Angeles, CA",24,110,19,4.0,2/28/2012,"Out for a little dessert in Pasadena and this location is in the heart of Old Pasadena.  Be prepared to pay for parking during the evening as there's only PAID garage parking & meter parking available.  Had Adam's Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple which was pretty killer if you want lots of peanutbutter.  The fresh whip cream added some balance.  Guys at the Cheesecake Take-Out were a little disorganized BUT, they did get my order together."
Aparna J.,"Pasadena, CA",0,16,,4.0,5/26/2014,Good food great service. Earlier had walked out of another restaurant for bad service but cheese cake factory saved the day! Cheers! Keep up the good job.
kush e.,"Los Angeles, CA",30,36,17,4.0,2/4/2010,"This review will not rely heavily on this particular location's culinary prowess, but their knowledge of cook times & overdone vs. underdone because it's The Cheesecake Factory. The food is good, but it's not imaginative.  As a Cheesecake Factory fan (I swear, it's the ""chocolate"" bread [you know, their free wheat bread that I gave a special & fitting nickname to] that keeps me coming back), I can safely say I've tasted about 85% of their dishes. I'll list the dishes that stood out to me (if you're looking for burger reviews, LOL go somewhere else with that shit). 1) Jambalaya with pasta. I always, always order this with extra sauce on the side because the sauce is delicious & you cannot go wrong with extra sauce. The Pasadena location is the only location that can consistently cook this pasta to perfection which is a make or break on a dish like this.  2) Angel hair with shrimp. It's a simple pasta, probably something I could whip up at home, but the tomatoes at least TASTE fresh & the shrimp & pasta are both perfectly cooked (at all locations).  3) Jamaican black pepper shrimp. I was feeling adventurous when I first ordered this one &....it's a mood thing. It's not a default order (jambalaya)...you know how you always have that one dish you always feel guilty for ordering ALL THE TIME. The spice is nice, the mango salsa is what you'd expect, & the beans are tolerable (I hate the texture of beans, but these are flavorful enough to make up for it).  4) Shrimp scampi. Honestly, no one can mess this dish up, but somehow (Cheesecake Factory, La Brea), you did. Pasadena on the other hand, you have never disappointed me. So one time I was practically swooning over the scampi & my friend is curious, so she has a bite & exclaims, ""WHAT THE HELL THAT'S ALL BUTTER?"" I gave her a blank look & since then, I've questioned our relationship.  Although the wait times can get ridiculous at night, if you're ever going to a Cheesecake Factory, I'd go with this location. Followed closely by the one at The Grove. Even with the headache over parking & paying somebody money to park my car somewhere just so I can pay someone to make food I was to lazy to make, these two places win over all the others. PS: Although the food is slow, the service is always very friendly & prompt about my chocolate bread refills except YOU, Victoria Gardens."
Freddy R.,"North Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA",39,157,43,4.0,4/19/2012,"Five of us went for my birthday. Philly steak sandwich, cajun jambalaya, shepherd's pie, chicken romano, and meatloaf sandwich were all good, everybody loved their meals. Our awesome waiter, Preston, recommended the chicken romano for me because I was undecided, and he hit the nail on the head. I loved it. His service was fantastic, we loved him. He was quick, attentive, fun, friendly, and kept all of us happy. He and other's came to the table to sing Happy Birthday to me. He did a great job. We all had cheesecake, red velvet was awesome, raspberry white chocolate was probably the best, limoncello torte cheesecake was just fair and a little dry, and a regular cheesecake which was good. Thanks for the great birthday dinner and thanks again to Preston!"
Pettra T.,"Los Angeles, CA",349,180,27,5.0,5/25/2011,Herb Crusted Lunch Salmon with mashed potatoes and asparagus.... GLOWREYYY!!!!  Comfort food any day. ANY!
Sharon K.,"Sierra Madre, CA",48,262,738,5.0,5/8/2007,"The Cheesecake Factory in Pasadena is always packed! Day and Night! If you can handle the wait, go right ahead. There's always shops on Colorado Blvd you can shop or bring something you can do for hours. If you have a choice, go to the one in Arcadia or Redondo Beach. For some odd reason this place is always always packed with people. They do not take reservations, they don't need to. Just drive by and look at the line.  Let's see, the food is awesome. I love the steak Diane with shrimp scampi or salmon. They have also have lunch specials around $8-12. They serve a variety of pasta, steak, salads, sandwiches, and of course cheesecake! Lots of non-alcoholic and alcoholic drinks. The cheesecake is a must! Although its a bit pricey! (Around $5-6 a piece)  The service is typically good, the waiters are attentive and your meal arrives on a timely manner.  *Subject to change"
Solida N.,"Pasadena, CA",60,29,,2.0,6/29/2013,"Only because this is a franchise. I like this place in regards to their dishes. Anyways, my review for this particular cheesecake factory is based on their services. I have probably gotten a handful of excellent service, more A-OKay service and a few really bad service. But those few really bad service is what stood in my memory of this place. My boyfriend and I were seated for 15 minutes (we timed it after like being seat for 5 minutes) and no one came by. After 15 minutes, thirsty and already flipped through the menu several times, we already knew what we wanted. When he came by, we ordered our dish. He didn't come by with our waters, which we asked another waiter to get us. When the food came out, he didn't bring it out (which was fine) but he never came by to check on up. By the time we were done with our meal, he decided to come by. AND THIS IS WHAT MAKES ME THE MOST FURIOUS. As he came by, he didn't stop at our table but instead continue walking and talking. Like a drive by. He came by with our check and we never saw him again. So you're wondering if we tipped him... HECK NO! Gratitude is a privilege that is earned and he definitely didn't earn it."
Aaron T.,"Los Angeles, CA",57,18,,1.0,2/23/2009,"I only went beacuse I HAD to. It was for a co-worker's birthday, and they didn't ask me for any brilliant and culinary insights. So we end up at Chainstorecake Factory. After a delightful 50 minute wait, standing on faux-marble, we are taken to our table by what appears to be a Junior High scool aged student. Poor girl. They better be paying her at least minimum wage. The kicker was our waiter, who obviouly thought he was the most gorgeous man to rove the planet, and wanted to make sure that we thought so too. I'm all for a flity waiter, after all, it can be fun - and lead to fun things, but this guy was way too into himself. Funny thing is that I've seen him around the bars over the past couple of years, and has got quite the reputation about him. Let's just just say that I know things that I shouldn't repeat here on yelp! All that to say, as hot as his body was, his attitude ruined it for all of us.  We still tipped decently though, because we are good at heart - and I don't wanna be an ass right back."
J C.,"La Canada, CA",0,6,,4.0,10/4/2010,"The Cheesecake factory still remains on our family's TOP TEN list, simply because of the variety and affordability.  When paying for an extended family of 20, it's difficult to find a place that surpasses this place in terms of accomodations, family-friendly atmosphere, quality, and quantity. Granted, many of the dishes do taste similar, but if you venture to try something new every time you go, you eventually find that they do have a decent variety of dishes that are authentic in their own way.   This is my ideal place for a date night, but I'd be happy to bring my family here any time."
Alex B.,"Burbank, CA",0,15,,3.0,9/28/2012,"Usually wait time is ridiculous, but sometimes it can be better. Food is good as well as service. I like the americana location the most though."
