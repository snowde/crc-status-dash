Aaron C.,"Los Angeles, CA",295,156,,4.0,5/19/2009,"The Cheesecake Factory chain has always been able to please no matter where the location is. I've been to the Pasadena location quite a number of times now and I've always left fuller, fatter, and happy. For lunch they have a good number of smaller sized lunch portions for a good price. Then for dinner they take out the big guns. I've tried most of the pastas and I have to say each one them are really different and unique. Same goes for their steaks and most of all, their cheesecakes. List of my favorite dishes (not ranked in order because I like all of them) PASTA DA VINCI Sauteed Chicken, Mushrooms, Onions and Garlic in Madeira Wine Sauce with Penne Pasta and Parmesan ~This is one of their better pastas because it tastes like no other. The pasta is never overcooked (and this goes for all their pasta) and you could really taste every individual ingredient. The overall flavor is more salty than your typical and the wine sauce really makes this dish great. PASTA CARBONARA Spaghettini Tossed with Smoked Bacon, Sweet Green Peas and a Light Garlic-Parmesan Cream Sauce ~I love the texture of the bacon with the pasta. It adds a bit of crunch instead of the all over mushy feeling. I usually hate green peas but these sweet ones really pull it off. The sauce is not overly dousing either. GRILLED SKIRT STEAK Served with Mashed Potatoes, Vegetables and Crisp Onions ~I get this a lot. Not only is it a good sized steak for the price, but its sauce is sooo good. This can fill anyone up. FILET MIGNON with French Fries and Onion Strings ~Of course the most tender steak that his restaurant has to offer, but also the most expensive. Very tasty indeed HIBACHI STEAK Slices of Hanger Steak and Sauteed Shiitake Mushrooms over Onions, Bean Sprouts and a Soy Steak Sauce. Served with Tempura Asparagus and Wasabi Mashed Potatoes ~Now this is something new that most other restaurants don't offer or haven't even thought of. It's more of a Japanese styled steak that really makes the steak exotic. It tastes more salty and has that nice wasabi mashed potato. If you're not a wasabi fan don't order! GRILLED CHICKEN AND AVOCADO CLUB Grilled Chicken Breast with Avocado, Bacon, Tomato, Melted Swiss and Herb Mayonnaise. Served with French Fries ~I probably really like this because the name includes two of my most favorite ingredients. They really compliment each other nicely in this sandwich and that's what makes it so good. The mayo mixed with the swiss is a very nice experience too. and for cheesecakes: ORIGINAL GODIVA CHOCOLATE CHEESECAKE FRESH BANANA CREAM CHEESECAKE  CHOCOLATE OREO MUDSLIDE CHEESECAKE  30th ANNIVERSARY CHOCOLATE CAKE CHEESECAKE You can tell that I'm a chocolate lover and yes all of these chocolate cheesecakes are actually different in some way. But really all of them are really good, it's just what's your favorite topping! The only reason why I gave it 4 stars is because you can't make reservations."
Soo C.,"Alhambra, CA",81,193,26,2.0,12/11/2011,I never expect to get great service at any Cheesecake factory. My waiter was very slow. I ended up getting my own water and nobody even blinked an eye when they saw me get the pitcher and fill my tables water! REALLY!?! Trust me...some staff members saw me and they didn't say anything!
Cassandra C.,"West Covina, CA",61,105,26,4.0,12/9/2011,"This review is based solely on the drinks and coming out on a Tuesday night for some drinks. We were immediately seated and our orders were immediately taken. Some of the best mojitos I have ever had. The blueberry mojito is delicious, you can taste the mint but not too much mint leaves in the drink. The passion fruit mojito is totally opposite, a lot of  mint leaves but not to minty. The drinks were a little pricey approximately 10-12 dollars. However, if I am ever craving a mojito, I'm definitely coming here"
Zena B.,"Pasadena, CA",18,52,19,3.0,1/11/2010,"Let's dig in. It deserves a 2.5. I would never opt to eat at any Cheesecake Factory because it's a chain, the menu is too long, the food is just ok, the portions are too huge, and the cheesecake isn't the best.   BUT, if you have to eat here, trust me on this, order the thai lettuce wraps.  It is honestly the best thing on the menu."
CJ J.,"Irvine, CA",1367,1047,570,4.0,10/14/2008,"Seared Tuna Tataki Salad with dressing on the side. MmM mMm MmMmmM! It's one of my favorite salads in the whole world. Yes it's at a chain restaurant but you can't help what you love. Lily got some luau/lalu/lulu something salad and I was like What the heck!? It was huge and had wontons!!! mmmMMmm. Wontons are the devil. We had our salads, got some Peach Bellinis (which are ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS!!!!!!!!!!!), shared a few bites of the 30th anniversary cheesecake (cheesecake + chocolate cake: zOMG), and got some coffee. What a great meal! It was a great girls night out. We even got into a man bashing session with our waitress!!! hahahahhahahaa. Women unite right? Can't live with them but can't live without them. Men. :) Peach Bellinis are calling my name! I can hear it! :)"
Alvin V.,"Pasadena, CA",690,211,37,4.0,11/5/2008,"Yes the wait is Horrible... Yes its another restaurant chain.... Yes there are cute waitresses here..... Oh wait.... But hey you gotta just love Cheesecake for what it is.. I like the Pasadena location. I've been here MANY times (too much I guess) but I'm never not satisfied.... Yeah you can complain about the wait, then you should call in reservations like I always do cause you KNOW this place is always packed... The food... Good, some say great, some say bleh but I say good. I've had my fair share of the good the bad and the ugly here, that is why I stick to my usually: CRISPY CHICKEN COSTOLETTA (Chicken Breasts, Lightly Breaded and Sauteed to a Crisp Golden Brown. Served with Lemon Sauce, Mashed Potatoes and Fresh Asparagus) Yeah, that's right.. I just described the dish, you like you're drooling over it right now...  I'm always pretty satisfied with the service here, and they are usually very attentive.. On top of that this Cheesecake Factory is located in the center of Old Town Pasadena.. So when you finish your meal, take a stroll, walk off that Chicken Costoletta and have a cigarette.. Cause that's what I do."
E S.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,15,,4.0,2/3/2014,"They have really good salads and one of the best Kobe burgers I've ever had. This place is comfort food at its best, always there and always reliable."
H J.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,17,1,3.0,3/2/2013,"I have mixed feelings with this particular Cheesecake Factory. I know that it depends on the individual workers, etc. but I feel that I had a fairly inconsistent customer service satisfaction at this place. There were times when the waiters/waitresses were absolutely curteous and had gone the extra mile for service, while there was a time when I had a grumpy and snappy waitress... which is not professional. The food at this particular Cheesecake Factory is pretty good. It is a go to place when I'm out of ideas."
Jo C.,"Los Angeles, CA",86,62,28,4.0,12/22/2010,"so cheesecake factory is one of those restaurants that you can frequent quite often when you're thinking you don't want to cook.. but want something solid to eat.. (they have a gazillion options to choose from from small plates, to appetizers, soups, salads, pizzas, burgers, steaks, fish, pasta, mexican.. asian.. etc)  oddly, when cheesecake factory first introduced itself to.. myself.. years ago.. i was not very enthusiastic about checking it out... or returning for a meal, but over the years i've found myself growing pretty fond of the cheesecake factory.. especially the one in pasadena.. they have great service and i've never had any issues with any of my dishes even with the numerous times we've ended up dining here..  some great go to's if you don't know what you want to order:  1. hibachi steak (love the marinade, love the mashed wasabi potatoes, the sauteed shiitake mushrooms, tempura asparagus.. YUM)  2. miso salmon.. salmon is topped with a sweet glaze and the dish comes with rice and snow peas in a miso sauce (such a great blend of flavors).. i usually switch out the rice for mashed potatoes.. ^^  3. buffalo blasts.. if you're a fan of buffalo wings, this is a MUST.  4 pasta da vinci.. sauteed chicken, mushrooms, onions in a madeira wine sauce tossed with penne and parmesean.... my favorite pasta dish here! the thing is, as most can attest, the servings are HUGEEEE here and i always pack left overs for the next day..  and of course I am a HUGE fan of the red velvet cheesecake and the tiramisu cheese cake.... make sure to save room for dessert or pack one to go! parking: 90 minutes free in the structures, 2 dollars for every hour there after..  if you go on a weekend or during holiday it will be VERY busy, so plan ahead (no reservations) and know that you may spend some time waiting to be seated (i usually just hop across the street to jcrew until it's close to our seating..)"
Olga A.,"Pleasanton, CA",0,5,,2.0,7/18/2012,"My family needed to find a quick place to eat while in pasadena and we werent impressed.  The portion sizes are out of control and the places was dark, loud, and crowded. I would give it one star, but the service was descent. If you are going to come here, I suggest that you order from the skinny menu or split orders with a friend."
Frank W.,"Valencia, CA",0,388,10,2.0,4/22/2013,"My wife and I came to this location last Friday night around 6PM for a romantic dinner. It was not packed at the time. We got seated at a half booth half chair table. When we realized we couple have gotten seated at a booth table, it was a little late because we've already been assigned to a server and didn't want the server to lose our patronage. I wish the hostess would have at least given some choices for seating when there were so many open seats."
KJ D.,"Palmdale, CA",0,61,10,4.0,3/31/2013,"Love this Cheesecake Factory! The food is always good (miso salmon... my mouth is watering!), the service is great and the place is so clean. Don't worry about a diet if you come here, just go ahead and have cheesecake for dessert. Your tummy will thank you. You can diet another day."
Max T.,"Los Angeles, CA",50,17,1,1.0,12/22/2011,I can't believe there are commercials in the menu. How tacky. I know they sell that space but there isn't any cost savings for me. Scum bags
Nico M.,"Altadena, CA",7,44,23,1.0,9/30/2011,"Went here once, and really didn't like the food, but figured we'd go back for the cheesecake.  Couldn't deal with the lines, so picked up a slice of the ""closest they have to New York Cheesecake.""  It was much faster to pick up, and I'm glad the counter is right by the door for the purchase.  But I paid eight bucks and the cheesecake was neither real new york style nor was it fresh tasting.  The thin layer of sour cream topping on top had a distinct dry skin to it, indicating it was not really fresh, and frankly, the cheescake had neither the fun rich earthy-ness of New York style, nor the smooth, glidey yumminess of more custardy cheesecakes.  It was too sweet and frankly not good at all.  I would have been better off with a defrosted frozen pie from Trader Joes.  And this place calls itself a Cheesecake factory?  I don't think we'll EVER go back."
Michele K.,"Costa Mesa, CA",14,17,2,2.0,11/14/2010,Make sure you get your credit card back from a server named Samantha S. She pretended she 'dropped' it after I asked where it was.
Arsenio A.,"West Covina, CA",77,22,6,5.0,3/19/2011,"The Kobe burger was fanominal! The flavor from the onions and cheese and seasoning in the beef. The sweet potato fries were the best I have ever tasted! I have had a craving for them and no restaurant has been able to satisfy this craving until now. Great service, great food, great restaurant."
Crystal S.,"Long Beach, CA",62,181,5,4.0,8/25/2009,"I've been to various Cheesecake Factory locations over the years, and have had both great and not-so-good experiences.  Went to a Birthday Dinner here last Saturday evening, and was impressed enough to write a review. First of all, our party of 10 or so people got there without a reservation so we had to wait a heck of a long time to be seated at a long table which would be conducive to our celebration.  Not good.  The hostess made it up to us by giving us three free appetizers of our choice.  Now that's what I'm talkin about.  Why don't more places comp food in order to appease their patrons.  The appetizers were tasty too, avocado eggrolls, spicy buffalo wings and taquitos. I'd definitely order the first two items again.... surprisingly good! Second, our food came out very quickly even though the place was very crowded, and every one of us commented on how happy we were with what we ordered.  My fiance ordered a $20 steak, which was tender and cooked perfectly.  I ordered the ""Evelyn's Favorite"" pasta and couldn't stop talking about how good it was, etc. etc.   Next, I wasn't happy with the Manhattan that I ordered so they took it back and made me a Mojito without any complaint whatsoever.   Finally, our group was extremely ear-piercingly loud!  There were patrons that actually moved out of the room to get away from us.  However, our waiter was never a jerk to us asking us to keep it down or anything.  All in all, a well-run establishment and I'll be happy to visit it again someday."
D P.,"San Diego, CA",185,33,6,4.0,10/25/2011,I always get good service here plus you can't go wrong with the chocolate truffle tower cake...
marlon e.,"Los Angeles, CA",666,798,128,3.0,10/28/2008,I HATE THE LONG WAIT!!! all i want is to walk in a restaurant... get seated within 5 minutes and  order my food right away... the wait here is ridiculous...  the food was good... they always deliver despited being busy every time... so if you got too much time to kill go here in peak hours and start waiting in line... and eat slow...you'll spend half of your day here...
Ed T.,"San Marino, CA",59,365,133,4.0,7/28/2011,Love their salads! My boys love their hamburgers! There are so many to choose from! And who could resist their cheese cakes.
