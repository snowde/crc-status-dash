Tracy S.,"Monterey Park, CA",134,214,182,5.0,3/16/2011,"I have always and will always be a big fan of the Cheesecake Factory. Two must have dishes: Pasta Da Vinci and Chicken Farfalle. My ultimate favorites and the only two dishes I order. I've tried other dishes but nothing compares to these two dishes. It will always get me coming back for more. The portions are also really good. I always have leftovers for another meal :D I also love love their complimentary breads, specifically the wheat bread. And of COURSE their Tiramisu Cheesecake :):) I will ALWAYS be down for some Cheesecake Factory!"
Joe A.,"West Hollywood, CA",198,14,,4.0,10/11/2010,"Cheesecake Factory?  More like GHOSTcake Factory!!!  I have always been a fan of this place.  The service is great, the appetizers are fantastic, they portions large (even the drink glasses are large) and the Oreo Cake is amazing.  The only bone I have to pick (skeleton bones) with this place is that I think it is haunted by numerous ghosts and spirits.  I went to the bathroom upon my return, the chairs were stacked on the table like the movie Poltergeist.   You do the math."
Angelique Q.,"Highland, CA",283,276,240,3.0,7/12/2008,"This isn't exactly my favorite Cheesecake Factory to dine at because of parking and the usual long long long waits during certain times and days of the week. But  I fed myself one of my favorites, Crispy Chicken Costoletta, and I was happy."
Adriane M.,"Marina del Rey, CA",11,48,34,1.0,11/20/2012,"I had dinner at this location last night and it was not a good 1st experience at this location at all. The server was was not friendly she didn't pay attention at all to detail she asked if I wanted ice with my pellegrino and I said yes and she brings two cups of water no ice I had to get someone else to get me ice, then with my dinner I asked for brocolli instead of asperagus and got spinash on top of that my dinner was cold my chicken was slightly warm but the mashpotatoes where cold cold. Then I had asked her for extra sause which took a good 15 minutes before I had even gotten it by that time I was full and my food was even colder so I had her just pack it in a to go box with the rest of the food I didn't eat. Really bad service it would of been one thing if she was really friendly and attended to me and my boyfriend but most of the time it felt like we where just forgot about and left at our table. I will not be going back!"
Susy H.,"Los Angeles, CA",307,224,114,3.0,8/5/2008,"You always know what to expect when you go to Cheesecake. An over the top menu, monster portions, and decent food. The garlic noodles with asparagus, tomato and chicken was ok. The chicken was just overcooked. Next time I will try it with shrimp instead of the chicken."
James W.,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",59,1025,49,3.0,12/26/2009,"Generally a nice, safe (food selection wise) place for a ""date night"" type of dinner. This location is loud and festive. Good selection of dishes to please almost any palate. The hostess at this location was snooty and appeared to be in grumpy mood. Our server was nice and knew how to handle customers. All in all, we were seated quickly and our order was prepared as we liked it."
Thai N.,"Santa Ana, CA",0,10,,4.0,12/11/2013,"Had the primed sirloin steak here last month. The steak was excellent. Hostess was crap, trying to sit us down next to the bathroom when half of the restaurant was vacant. 4 stars for the food, 4 stars for the waiter, 1 star for the hostess."
Davy W.,"Los Angeles, CA",178,21,26,1.0,7/22/2008,"I might be a little biased here, as I'm not a huge fan of most chain restaurants, but seriously...if you're commuting from great lengths away to visit Old Town, why choose this place? There are plenty of other great non-chain restaurants that deserve a taste. My first and fondest memories of Cheesecake Factory was on the top floor of Macy*s in SF, a good 8 years ago. Ever since, Cheesecake Factory had never failed to disappoint me. We came to the Pasadena location a few years ago for a friend's birthday (an obligation if you'd ask me) and the lobby was crowded to the max. There were people waiting outside as well and even though we had a reservation, we still had to wait with the rest of the folks. You'd think it's a fire hazard or something. My friends ordered the Vietnamese Spring Rolls. The price was ridiculous. If you want good spring rolls, you go to the dirty hole-in-the-wall Vietnamese restaurants in Westminster or ""Golden Deli"" in San Gabriel. You'll be paying for double the amount AND taste but minus the over-inflated price.  I tried the teriyaki salmon and it was dry as a brick. For that price, I'd much rather go to a Japanese restaurant where they make it much better.  I guess the cheesecake is pretty good, although more and more patisseries are coming up with better ones. If you really want to come here, just order the cheesecake to-go and leave as soon as you can wiggle your way through!  Instead of eating mock-cultural food, go to the actual restaurants instead, where you get much better tasting food. There's no need to fall into this Old Town hype."
Travelist H.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,20,,5.0,1/30/2011,"Seriously this is some the of the best customer service I have ever had! I'm comparing this to places like, Tavern on the green, Matisse, Valentinos, French Laundry, Spago's etc. This is a big time date place, if you walk by the north side of the restaurant (Colorado blvd) you see a lot of first dates, people on their best behavior, men acting like gentlemen, women ordering salads, very funny. All the while people walking by are looking at the girls legs, what food they are eating and making obscene gestures, it's quite uncomfortable for the couples there. Anyways since it is one of these date places the service is excellent, never an empty glass, condiments always ready, pepper is peppered, parmesan cheese is on call, etc. etc. the servers are super polite and super helpful. The food is good, it's Cheesecake factory, pretty consistent no matter which one you go to, everybody loves the salads and the jumbalaya, great sandwiches and I personally always get breakfast. So the food is 3 and a half stars but the service takes it to 5.  If your willing to wait 2 hours for a table (weekend evenings) and you want variety with good service this is the place to go. Less of a wait on weekdays and daytime hours, but not by much. Don't get me wrong Cheescake factory is ok, but is it really worth the wait? If you want to wait that long just go to Ago in Los Angeles where even if you have a reservation they make you wait 1 hour, but obviously the food is a lot better. Oh yeah and if you like a bunch of guys staring at your dates sexy legs all night and seeing what you can't see, since the table is in you way, sit by the windows, good times."
Jacqueline T.,"Murrieta, CA",198,57,32,3.0,8/17/2008,"I hate the lines outside on the curb this place creates, but the menu items are decent and all. Here are my top picks, try: Chicken Medallions Vegetable Salad  Banana Cream Cheesecake Raspberry Mango Smoothie (non alcoholic) Recently they have added a small bite list to their menu and it it has made all the difference! I highly recommend the Tuna Tartare and Arugla Salad:)"
Karin A.,"Glendale, CA",187,242,17,3.0,11/4/2008,"The wait is HORRRRRIIIIBBBBLLLLEEEE! about 20-30 minutes. The food is decent. The last thing i ate there was some pasta with like bacon, and it was quite good. Other then that the service is actually really good despite them being so busy all the time. The waiters and waitresses really do a great job. ill recommend this to anyone who doesn't mind waiting for 20-30 minutes."
Marie Y.,"Azusa, CA",114,155,13,3.0,6/30/2008,"Our server seemed to have a problem differentiating between morning and night.  When he came to our table, he asked me and girlfriend, how are you two doing this evening?  Um, it was Sunday morning.   Girlfriend and I came here for brunch by chance.  We didn't know how busy they would be since there's usually a line out the door, but we lucked out and were seated right away.  She ordered the hamburger and I ordered a 1/2 size of the santa fe salad.  The 1/2 size was huge and I couldn't finish even half of it.  It was decent, though. We were so full from our entrees that we had no room for cheesecake.  Oh well.  Now we know that Cheesecake Factory's entrees were meant for sharing.  At least in our case, anyway."
Nori S.,"Alhambra, CA",20,61,12,3.0,5/29/2009,"Can't go wrong with this place.  Good Bread, Good Portioned Meals and Drinks and Gooooood Cheesecake.   Of course if I eat here I can never order the cheesecake.   Only issue I've ever had with this place is that it's too crowded on the weekends."
Mindy H.,"Irvine, CA",419,324,291,4.0,6/26/2008,"Okay, after that HORRIBLE time a few weeks ago at the Bella Terra Cheesecake Factory in Huntington Beach. . .I was hesitant to come here. I shouldn't have been.  The miso salmon was flaky, moist. . .and had miso PASTE on top!!  Which meant it was floating on my tongue in an explosion of sweet, salty, tangy, and well, miso-y.  The spinach was drained properly. . .and it was just absolutely how I remembered Cheesecake's miso salmon to taste like.  My mother got the pasta da vinci. . .it was absolutely delicious.  The sauce was creamy, the pasta was al dente, and the chicken was moist (if a little bit on the big size).  My dad got the cheesesteak sandwich. . .he liked it though I didn't try it.  My parents dug their fries. . .they said it wasn't greasy but still very crispy. What sucked about THIS Cheesecake versus the one at Bella Terra was that the service was pretty bad.  The bread came out late. . .and even though we were seated swiftly. . .we waited for almost 40+ min. before our food arrived.  So. . .do I come here for bad and slow service but good food?  Or do I go to Bella Terra and get served crap but with smiling, happy, and accommodating waiters/waitresses??? Why can't I have it all? (I think this combination only exists at the Bev Hills location, cos let me tell you. . .the one near Westwood has a fleet of ATROCIOUS waitstaff). Unlikely it seems. . .the food and service at the Cheesecake Factories are VERY inconsistent."
Linda N.,"West Covina, CA",36,99,33,3.0,5/2/2013,"came here on a sunday a little bit after the lunch rush. it seemed a bit crowded, however my sister and i managed to snag a table in the bar area. we ordered our usual, the sun dried fettuccine with chicken, salad and on this day we decided to order a mimosa :) anywho, sat down and the server was super friendly, greeted us and brought us out some warm bread and water. the reason why i am giving it 3 stars is because the pasta was a little over cooked and a little more salty than usual. the salad had dressing on top when i asked for it on the side. overall it as a pretty good experience, minus the salty ness of the food. will visit this location again."
Summer S.,"Los Angeles, CA",54,681,3,4.0,6/8/2011,"I have to commend this Cheesecake Factory for such amazing service. Our waitress came by a lot to check up on us and I appreciate her for such sincere service. At the same time, food was pretty good and I love their lunch specials. Put this on your to-do list. ;)"
Morris C.,"Manhattan, NY",330,238,750,3.0,3/15/2011,"The Pasadena Cheesecake Factory is just like any other Cheesecake Factory, and I don't mean that in a bad way. The food is consistently good, with big portions and a large menu to pick from. Prices are reasonable as well, and service is alright. 3.5 stars, but I'm going to round down just because the wait time is often really long."
S M.,"Los Angeles, CA",11,20,2,4.0,12/11/2011,My husband and I love it here! I did order a chinese salad once and the salad was gross but we stick to the appetizers now with our awesome drinks and they always taste great! They also serve champagne by the glass. Very good.
Carrie B.,"Boulder, CO",15,63,,1.0,5/30/2008,"I've never been a huge fan of the Cheesecake Factory and this particular location really made me angry. Our server was really horrible and took a long time to get our order, water, etc. The table next to us was getting pretty irritated too and it was at 3pm so the place wasn't packed at all.  She gave me a really dirty bottle of ketchup that literally made our stomachs turn, but I get it..could have been a mistake. I asked her for a new one and she actually said that she couldn't see what I was talking about and wouldn't really change the bottle. It looked like someone put their greasy hands all over it while eating a burger. She took it back and did a semi wipe and brought back the same bottle.  The food was sub-par like usual and we couldn't get refills on water. The waitress knew we were irritated and just put down the check and left...she didn't ask us if we wanted dessert and we were at the cheesecake factory! My cousin and I were waitresses before so we are usually pretty sympathetic, but not this time...we were ready to get the manager which is something we never do!  I do like their strawberry cheesecake."
Meemo W.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,261,2,3.0,10/5/2011,"one thing i have to note on this particular one is that whenever i go here, the chicken is always dry..  no matter how much sauce is doused, the chicken is ALWAYS dry..  everything else that i've had on the menu, however, were decent unless you know of certain spots to park, find a parking structure"
