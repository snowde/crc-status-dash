Maria L.,"Tucson, AZ",14,265,28,4.0,4/5/2011,This location is always suuuuper packed!  I'm in love with most of their food...except of course their weight management offerings..if your gonna come to Cheesecake you need to go all the way! I love their complimentary bread....and the last time I went I ordered their special fried shrimp and fries with cole slaw and their green salad (which is huge) and my mom and I shared it....twas very tasty!
Alfred P.,"Los Angeles, CA",388,231,2,2.0,11/15/2006,"Patrons are playing into the hype without knowing it.  The only reason people come here is because they automatically assume that long lines = great restaurant.  Not so, about the food at least.  The service is great, they invest more money into employee training than any other chain...I think. I've eaten at a Cheesecake Factory three times and every single time the food was crap.  This herb-crusted fish thing isn't supposed to be a tarragon wasteland and it's dryer than the fucking Sahara.  These mashed potatoes aren't supposed to have a layer of crust, this ain't a godam creme brulee.  Fuck, not this again, this pasta dish is dry.  This makes no sense, it's drenched in a marinara sauce.  ok, I'm cool now. Bitches."
Roni R.,"Los Angeles, CA",159,369,,5.0,5/11/2008,"I don't often go to chain restaurants but I am so excited to report that this chain really left me feeling impressed w/their breakfast!   Great friendly and speedy service, great food (highly rec'd the huevos rancheros!) and great location!   Don't really rec'd corp chains but I'm pretty sure I'll be back!  Dang, that breakfast menu looked soooooooooo good!  :-)"
Nicolette M.,"Pasadena, CA",9,36,2,5.0,3/25/2011,"Hard to believe I have lived in California for 30 years, and yesterday was my first time to experience The Cheesecake Factory.   Enjoyed the food, and found the overall atmosphere of the restaurant to be quite upbeat."
Wesley V.,"West Covina, CA",61,192,66,4.0,2/8/2013,I've been here a lot.  The portions are quite big for their prices.  I just love the free bread that they always give out when you come.  I love coming in for lunch.  Their lunch specials are cheaper and definitely worth their prices.  I ordered fish and chips here and the serving came out to be bigger than I thought.  One time I had their Jambalaya Cajun pasta and substituted the shrimp for chicken.  Delicious and huge.  The workers welcoming and seem interactive.  I'd recommend this place for anyone.
Joe G.,"Pasadena, CA",225,44,9,5.0,4/22/2011,Great food good Service!  A little pricey but well worth it!  I love the shrimp club on wheat bread with a side of ranch.
Claire M.,"Pasadena, CA",37,32,5,4.0,1/29/2011,"Great atmosphere, friendly staff and GREAT FOOD! I always order the pulled pork sandwich with sweet potato fries. So yummy and never is disappointing! :) although sometimes the wait can be quite long!"
Cindy R.,"Granada Hills, CA",15,85,1,3.0,4/14/2011,I ordered petite mignon & the steak was great & the onion rings were great but spinach & dirty martini was aweful!!!
V P.,"Alhambra, CA",14,82,,3.0,5/26/2009,"This was another food stop since I had family here for the long weekend. Not my choice however.  Saturday night at 6 for a party of 6 was a 5 minute wait. That's a first for the cheesecake factory. I don't really like going to Old Town Pasadena so much anymore because of the parking situation and foot traffic, especially since we have a baby now, we pay for parking at the lots. We used to live in Pasadena and would walk to Old Town but  alas no more.  Got the appetizer sampler, 30 bucks for a bunch of stuff, although most of it was ok, not great.  Ordered the Double bbq bacon burger. 3 pieces of hamburger bun, slightly excessive! I couldn't even do half especially after the sampler. Husband got the shepherds pie. He is a glutton for punishment. It always sounds good to him and he gets it about each time we go but then is disappointed with it afterwards! The rest of our group got the shrimp scampi, jambalaya, and goat cheese salad.  Too full for cheesecake at the restaurant so we ordered it to go. The pineapple upside down and the chocolate cake cheesecake. The pineapple one was really good! I'd get it again!"
laurel d.,"Long Beach, CA",54,133,17,2.0,8/22/2006,"Nothing quite affirms my suburban middle class American experience like eating at the Cheesecake Factory. Typically packed because their locations are brilliantly plunked in the middle of a mall parking lot, the ambiance is dimly lit and chaotic--who needs to relax, after all?  Let's just keep it moving, people. KEEP IT MOVING! While perusing the menu, I'm interested in so many bland Americanized dishes, but I'm also sidetracked by the sudden urge to shop at Chico's and buy a Benz.  Where could these sudden urges come from? Well, never mind, I'll just go with the chicken pot pie and bottomless Coke.  After all, I have an appetite fueled by consumerism and everyone knows shopping is like exercise.  BRING ON THE SATELLITE-SIZED PLATE O' GOODNESS! It's so comforting to know that I can get this consistency all over the nation, too.  When I feel like branching out, I'll head to the Olive Garden."
Daniel P.,"Glendale, CA",132,30,,5.0,3/5/2011,"It's the Cheesecake Factory, it's awesome."
Donna S.,"Glendora, CA",334,752,4899,4.0,7/31/2007,"It's the Cheesecake.  I don't know where else to go and find such a variety of cheesecake.  I love the lemon raspberry and I usually hate raspberry cheesecakes.  The Tuxedo Cheesecake is just to rich and sinful for words.   Yea, the wait.  I don't find the food worth the wait.  I am probably emotionally scarred since the one time I did pay my dues and wait a sickening amount of time, I ordered the Thai pasta. Some sort of Thai dish.  Terrible.  But I blamed myself. What was I thinking ordering Thai food at an American restaurant?  My bad.  I have since found Avacado Rolls, Fire Roasted Asparagus, Portabella Burger, Chicken Tostada, Eggplant Sandwich.  And ONLY if there is no wait. AND ONLY if we are getting Cheesecake to go.   We came for breakfast once, and it was pretty good. Think the man got breakfast burrito and I had artichoke omelette.  But not much of a breakfast variety if you are into breakfast."
Amy s.,"San Gabriel, CA",89,155,48,3.0,6/30/2011,"Service is great, but the food is not that impressive here. too busy ? I don't know."
Michael S.,"Verdugo City, La Crescenta-Montrose, CA",104,123,,2.0,4/12/2007,"I have this theory.   Considering the enormity of the menu at Cheesecake Factory, yet the complete generic-ness of it, I have a theory.    While the business briefs may not support this,  I believe that there is in fact some mega-restaurant corporations (full of old white guys with no taste buds) that owns all of the major mid-level national chains.  When I say mid-level, I'm talking Friday's, Applebee's, Chili's,  Outback, Olive Garden, PF Changs, etc, etc, Longhorn Steakhouse....Don Pablos...you get the idea.  Anyway, this evil corporation owns 'em all.   When trying to come up with the Next Big Chain Restaurant some executive at this corporation had this idea:  "" Why don't we open a restaurant that offers all the favorites, and some not so favorite dishes from all our other restaurants, that way we don't have to come up with ANY new ideas - we can put ads in the menu so we don't have pay for any thing, either"".   Another taste-budless co-worker replied,  ""This is a GREAT idea, but we need a hook...hmmm"".   Yet another replied ""I got it!  We'll package it all up with 8 gajillion different types of imagination-less cheesecake.  People love cheesecake, almost as much as they love crappy frozen yogurt from TCBY."" And thus, yet another boring over-crowded, personality-less, you don't matter, eat your food and get out, chain restaurant was born.  At a subsequent meeting: Old executive, ""We gotta make this place stand out. I know, we won't make the wait-staff wear flair, and we'll plop our over-bloated asses next to every mall from Augusta, ME to Los Angeles"" I really don't like this restaurant.  After my first visit, I've only gone back to compromise with friends.  The food isn't even worth reviewing since they have literally ripped off every chain restaurant in the book - hell, they even have White Castle Sliders as an appetizer!?! As a final aside, someone, who'd worked at an Applebee's, once told me that you didn't need a knife to be a chef there, you could do it all with a pair of scissors."
Kat O.,"Azusa, CA",35,89,70,5.0,2/11/2013,"Although im a cpl weeks late with this review I will say this was my first time ever at The Cheesecake Factory (although I'll be back soon with a friend) What can I say The restaurant impressed me with the spotless environment of every aspect that I had the chance to experience. The Food just melted in my mouth First the Asian wraps suggested by the best server ever Katie G., then my friend got the grilled salon and I got the grilled chicken with asparagus, and though Im not a fan of salmon usually i tasted my friends salmon and it was delicious! All the food was extrordinarily prepared and tasted great.For dessert I chose the Red Velvet Cheesecake and my gf chose a different one although when she saw mine ,she looked so sad we changed her order to the red velvet cheeseckae also. Again a melt in your mouth experience. Our meals were off the extensive skinnylisciouys menu and we boxed over half to take home as well as the rest of our cheeesecakes.The servings are very generous.Would I repeat this experience ? Absolutely.Kudos to the entire staff and management at this delectable restaurant.Thank you for a great experience!If you have a great experience with your server or wait staff, contact their manger as I did. I just wanted to commend Katie G. on her fantastic customer service and suggestions.Next time I will take pics of the food."
Vincent L.,"Montebello, CA",3,23,,2.0,1/14/2007,"Made it through the holidays and we are cashing in the gift cards...last one left.. Cheese Cake Factory....  Yikes.. 30 minute wait.. crowded foyer and noisy seated in the bar area, so close to another table that I could hear the person next to me chewing their food.(gross) ordered Kobe steak burger and it took 40 minutes and two apologizes to get to our table. If you like a cafeteria type location , then this is your spot.. I will never return... Restrooms clean"
Corazon R.,"Los Angeles, CA",618,320,17,3.0,2/23/2007,"Here is my take of the place: I hate all the people who take up sidewalk waiting outside. As if they own the spot and won't yield to people just passing through. The wait. Why... Avoid the line and go to the bar area. It's a pretty good size and you can order from the full menu there.  There are two things I will go there for: their chicken salad sandwich (such a good deal: $8 for a LARGE, generously loaded sandy plus awesome side salad) and the chicken madiera. Oh, and the cheesecake is good. But I only crave those like....once a year."

Steve A.,"Glendale, CA",84,8,6,4.0,4/19/2011,"I love Cheesecake Factory, what a menu. However this last weekend I was disappointed for the first time. Im not sure if was our server or something else. Having said that I will keep going back and still love it."
Frances D.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,42,,4.0,6/5/2011,"Chicken and sun dried tomato fettuccine and a snickers cheesecake is what I usually get every time I go here. But this time I got the strawberry shortcake for dessert! It was pretty good! Fresh strawberries, vanilla ice cream and whipped cream! I finished the whole thing! The Chinese Chicken Salad is pretty good as well."
