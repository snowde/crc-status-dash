Sam H.,"Pasadena, CA",3,57,,1.0,3/26/2012,"I will never eat here again! I'm not a fan of this chain anyway, but my friend was visiting from Ireland and has always wanted to go, fair enough. I ordered lettuce wraps without chicken. When they came the first thing I see is chicken in all three wraps. I send them back. Back they come from the chicken with the waitress telling me they have been remade. I eat two of them and as I'm in the middle of eating the third I see two huge chunks of chicken. Did they really remake my wraps or did they just try to pick the chicken out? I'm a strict vegan and for me this is just unacceptable. It's disgusting. I called the waitress over to show her and her reaction was that of annoyance instead of being apologetic. My two Irish friends were both super unimpressed as well. I'll never understand the hype over the Cheesecake Factory unless you are just going for the cheesecake. Shitty service and shitty food. Glad to say I'll never have to complain about this restaurant again because I'm never going back."
Marc J.,"Palm Springs, CA",11,57,51,4.0,1/23/2009,"The Cheesecake Factory food is rather ordinary, with two wonderful exceptions - the Vietnamese Spring Rolls and the Hot Corn Tamale Cakes. Both are appetizers, vegetarian sizes, but either one alone is enough for a full meal. Portion sizes are absurd, and I couldn't imagine eating dessert here. They are so far over the top, you'd think everyone dining there is 400 pounds. These two choices are my sole reason for being a fan of Cheesecake Factory. However, this like almost any other place, is never worth waiting in line for a table. There are plenty of restaurant choices. What's the matter with people who stand around for an hour waiting for a table? Get a life and go somewhere else. If I can't walk through the door and immediately be seated, I'll go to another restaurant and return here another time. And another thing...The advertising in the menu is crass and crude. Yes, it probably costs plenty to print those menus, but get rid of the advertising. Seriously low class."
Sintiea S.,"New York, NY",119,332,,2.0,6/2/2007,"I can't believe this place is always packed during dinner and lunch! Seriously if you are in Old Town, there are soooooo many other places to choose from..why settle for cheesecake factory? The food is overpriced for its quality and the wait is ridiculous. The only reason i end up at this place like once a year, is because one of my friends really wants to eat there. I have also been traumatized by the stories I have heard from people who used to work there..let's just say the food has some extra ingredients that aren't included in the menu -_-. The only reason it gets two stars is because of their cheesecake and strawberry lemonade."
Glen T.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,102,,4.0,9/2/2008,"As most Cheesecake Factory's this one has good food with large portions and the service is good.   The wait can be a lengthy if you get there late.  I find it funny how people give it a low rating for having such a long wait.   Well, doesn't that tell you it's popular.  Doesn't that tell you maybe you should get there earlier, maybe have a few drinks at the bar but come on.   Isn't that like getting to a popular movie late and complaining there aren't any good seats?      The bar serves some stiff drinks and the service is all around good.  If you can find a seat at in the bar area while waiting for your table it can be quite enjoyable with your date.   If you're single there's a lot of traffic here."
Tony W.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,26,,3.0,11/11/2014,"came here for a meal with my family after the movies and felt more like a fast food restaurant, we came more for convenience sake as we were with the kids.  our entire meal took less than 35 mins and felt like they were rushing to get us out of there.  food was average like any other cheesecake factory however stay away from the chicken piccata my wife got a stomach that night as that was all she had that day because she was sick.  pretty sure it wasnt her sickness as I shared it with her and I too got a mild stomach ache.  nonetheless not sure if it was the chicken piccatta or not but I would stay away."
Phoebe W.,"Alhambra, CA",493,91,42,4.0,1/19/2011,"Love cheesecake factory, but  I hope that they have smaller dishes with cheaper price so then I don't need to waste food."
Susan K.,"Sierra Madre, CA",3,60,6,4.0,7/10/2011,"This place has been here forever, it's the place I go when we don't know where else to go.  I remember there was a time (a long time ago) when you had to wait hours to get a seat, now it's much better.  The quality of food is consistent and service is good.  I always get the oriental salad or some type of pasta.  I stopped getting cheesecake ever since they posted the calories... so yeah...."
Cynthia G.,"Los Angeles, CA",108,279,6,4.0,10/19/2008,"Cheesecake factory is always our comfort restaurant, our go-to when we can't think of anything else.  The portions are ginormous, so if you order one appetizer + one entree and share, it's more than enough for a full meal.  It also brings your total bill to less than $30, so it's a relatively inexpensive way to enjoy a good and satisfying meal. Drinks here are mixed, not particularly great, but OKAY.  Service is also mixed; we've had terrible service several times, but not so bad that it made our experience unbearable. All the chicken dishes are GREAT, I've had almost every single one.  Try the BangBang Chicken!!  OR any of the Italian-prepared dishes!  Avocado eggrolls are awesome,.  Best pasta = bistro shrimp.  The coconut cheesecake tastes like Samoas (Girl Scout Cookies), and their torte is also super good. Clearly I come here too often."
StolenKitten T.,"Everett, WA",85,68,39,3.0,3/25/2008,"This place has a book for a menu. It's great if you know what you want to eat, but for people like myself...it's quite a difficult task when you can't make a decision. But so far, everything seems to be good (knock on wood)...except for the Shirmp Spring Roll appetizers. With about 2 small size shirmps, it's definitely not worth the $8!! The Calamaris, however, have a better reputation.  Definitely do not forget to order a martini or 2! They're quite good here! Happy eating and drinking! :D And if you have room, Happy desserting!...cheesecake of course!"
Faith V.,"Fredericksburg, VA",323,18,,1.0,3/20/2007,"The wait is horrible. You put your name on a list and wait to be called. You go up to the hostess and let them know your name is called. They say ok and then take another group back in front of you. Tell you they ""messed"" up and that you will be taken care of shortly. That means another thirty minutes. An hour wait isn't worth the cheesecake especially when you can buy it at any grocery store now. Ironically that makes more sense.  The garlic mashed potatoes are nothing to be impressed with because I can make those at home better any day of the week and I do for the children.  I will give them credit on their chicken pot pie. It isn't kid friendly which isn't exactly a plus for me."
Pedro C.,"Pico Rivera, CA",47,98,22,4.0,6/25/2011,"Good food, not too bad of a wait time. Depending on what day and time. Seating is kinda cramped, and a little to loud. But its old town pasadena, so its always crowded."
Manie R.,"Los Angeles, CA",11,36,19,5.0,9/5/2011,"I love the service and the Burgers, but I have yet to taste an actual pastry"
Gustavo G.,"Alhambra, CA",7,11,1,1.0,7/2/2012,"Well let me begin by saying iv'e been to other cheese cake factory and had a good time! I went to this one with my two kids on my birthday. We order appetizers about 10 min later they brought two out and said they ran out of the other one that i had order, I said no problem it's late (about 10pm) I order the biggest steak there! it was my birthday. they bring out my steak the waitress just drops it off and runs off said ( I'll be right back) 5 min go by i have to flag her down! I needed silverware. she said oh sorry, I say no problem. ten more min go by and no sign of her, finally she brings me out silverware but no steak knife, she says I'll be right back, now i'm getting a bit upset, she come back 5 min later and tells me we ran out of knife but we will get you one, ten more min go by and she come back and says we found some so will bring you one in a few min, I say that's ok just take the steak back! i'm upset know! she said well can i put it in a to go box for you? I say no I wanted to eat it here, she said ill reheat it for you! i said No! just take it and take it off the bill! she says well i cant do that! i ask for the manger he come out and ask me what the problem was? I tell him and he offered the same stupid thing to reheat the steak! I'm Furious!! bill comes out. steak still on there, I call the manager again and ask for his name so i could complain he gives me his first name only, i say do you have a last name? He asked me what I needed that for? Ha the nerve!!! I was so upset that two day later i write a letter to there corp office!! I get a reply about 3 weeks later saying (if you provide a receipt they will look in to it. i was really amazed by the way they handle it! I dint even get a simple (sorry) By the was i ended eating tacos of the taco truck on fair oak and union, They were great!! and to think these happen 3 years ago and I'm still upset over it."
Kim J.,"Los Angeles, CA",97,283,15,3.0,3/17/2008,"B wanted to go to the Cheesecake Factory in Pasadena. I can count the number of times I've been to different locations on one hand. The menus are epic, so I figure there's something there for just about anyone.  We went on a Saturday night. In my opinion, the wait was minimal, but it's pretty loud.  I had a glass of Riesling which was surprisingly tasty. B ordered the Pasta da Vinci and I ordered the crab cake sandwich which is served with lettuce, tomato and tartar sauce. I don't know what I expected. I had a specific taste and texture in my mind. The brioche was toasted with butter or something. It would have been better on a hard dry roll. B's pasta was actually pretty good and the waitress grated parmesan on top.  And of course, we ordered cheesecake and it was good.  I'll probably end up at Cheesecake Factory again, because so many people I know love it.  Anyone got any recommendations for future visits?"
Leon L.,"Alhambra, CA",8,30,16,4.0,7/4/2011,"One of the best steakhouse. I like the grilled salmon. Great service. Have a nice , small bar inside. Parking is a problem"
Stacy H.,"Los Angeles, CA",69,257,,5.0,12/5/2006,If you talk smack on this place I'll slap you. Its overindulgence galore and whats not to like about cheesecake?  This is a mom and me place. We pretend we are being healthy and order salads. Then we gorge on the molassas bread and split a cheesecake - you know the 6 carb one with splenda.
Alice C.,"Los Angeles, CA",218,260,106,4.0,10/3/2006,"Your average Cheesecake factory with, of course, good cheesecake selections.  Ones that should soley be your reason to go in unless you want to stuff yourself in addition to food.  One slice will make you full.  My friends boycott this place because I guess they feel it is overrated, and it is.  But that doesn't mean they don't have ONE good dish.  In fact, they have several.  For seafood pasta lovers, their SHRIMP SCAMPI is the best I've ever had.  Cooked with garlic (with actual chunks of garlic in it), a sauce to die for, and jumpo shrimp is complemented with angel hair pasta.  The flavor is incredible.  GOOD CHOICE.  Will make you full ... not expensive.  Another good choice for people who want to eat light ... their chicken salad sandwich is a killer too.  The bread is toasted and buttered, salad have almonds in it ... Great choice to share between two people because one peice is very big.  Complemented with a side salad that is REALLY good too.  For appetizers, get their shrimp popcorn.  And their strawberry lemonade is good too.  I am making myself hungry now at 9:40 a.m.  If you are allergic to seafood, I am sorry that this won't help you very much in your own personal choices.  And I am also sorry that you won't be able to try these great dishes.  [stars and comments are subject to change with each visit (^_^) ]"
Peter D.,"Pasadena, CA",1112,219,69,4.0,2/18/2010,"3 3/4 stars..This week, I awoke amidst a dream. The vision that I discovered was that of a restaurant. It was of one that carried my disappointment, but also found amid that shrouded darkness of that night, a forgiving hand in an executioner. Who was the foggy institution that prodded the inspired vision of my pillow? It was a child's will that lead the hand of fate and fulfilled my very dream. My daughter Lauren's birthday had arrived and she confided in me that she was emotionally bond to a single restaurant, The Cheese Cake Factory.  She maturely penned in my calendar, a lunch date for two. I was worried for the falling sands of the hourglass had taught me that time was fleeting and less then an hour to eat and return Snow White to school was a work of fiction I have no lasting disappointment with CCF, but they have done their utmost to confuse me. Let me place my Dr Phil cap on for a moment, minus the degree (stated for legal reasons); why do people insist on waiting in long lines for adequate but not inspired food selections? It may be the herd mentality; a person swayed by others eagerness, also known as a line. On their behalf, CCF is consistently reliable and steady. They do offer a lunch specials till 5 p.m., most items falling below the ($10) range.  I tackled the herb crusted fillet of salmon for ($12.95), it was good and reliable. That appears to be a thought this week, reliable food selections. Be prudent in selecting items here as they build confidence in many of their food selections but do stumble in some as well. My daughter Lauren went Paris Hilton on me and ordered the Shrimp and Angel Hair Pasta for ($16.95).  She either tired of the meal or I was very fortunate to firmly secure two very delectable shrimp.   If you have been to The Cheese Cake Factory you know that they have advertisements inside their menu. It irritates me but is an acceptable reality. What is beginning to bothering me though, and I need to verify produces prices, restaurants are now charging ($9) and above for chips and guacamole, and that includes CCF. They do offer an eclectic array of dishes that calm the beast and nurture the butterfly in any group and it would be false to say that other restaurants risk and attempt to service the limitless cravings of our ethnically diverse Californians. They do get credit for trying and walking the tightrope here.  The menu starts off by saying, ""The best possible food and service."" The spirit of their motto is felt in the seats and upon every fork of the restaurant!! Even with the throng of people on this day, they almost made a work of fiction a best seller on the nonfiction list. We were only twenty minutes late!"
Caitlin C.,"Los Angeles, CA",33,106,8,4.0,8/14/2006,"Alright, I know this was the place that was cool when you were in high school, and as uncool as it might be to admit it, I love it here. There's always a line, but the food is consistently good, the portions huge, and the cheesecake? Well, I don't like cheesecake, but I love this stuff.  I used to mess around and order a bunch of things, but I've learned it's all good and  now just stick with what I love - the salads, especially the Chinese Chicken Salad. My boyfriend usually split the dinner sized one since they are way too big to tackle alone.  Appetizers a good too if you're with a crowd. I say go with the avocado egg rolls: rich, crispy, creamy and sweet. Yum! Bar drinks are okay, pricey and kinda weak given the big glasses they come in. I'd take the sober route and order a lemonade. It comes in a big frosty mug rimmed with sugar... sweet and sour! I made the mistake once of looking at the nutrition values of the cheesecake and I've had a hard time not feeling guilty with every bite since then, so I only save it for special occasions (don't worry, I won't ruin it for you!). But like I said, I don't even like cheesecake, but every now and then I just can't resist theirs, it even makes it worth the gross indulgence. Always a good standby when I'm with my family because there is something for everyone or if I am just craving a meal I know will be good. It's hard to go when you're starving because you'll most likely have to wait (unless you can snag a seat at the bar - lucky!) but trust me, it's worth the wait."
Steve M.,"Hollywood, CA",75,174,31,3.0,3/8/2007,"Food was ok.  Service from the bar staff was horrible.  In particular a gentleman bartender who was African America with a shaved head, if there are any management reading this.  Very immature service, more worried about his life then serving ours.   Location is perfect and food was served at a time of 30 minutes, giving us plenty of time for conversation."
