Nicole N.,"Pasadena, CA",22,75,20,1.0,2/22/2012,"Visited on 2/19/12 at around 9 PM. I've been to this location numerous times but I typically order to go. We were a party of four and seated almost immediately. Started with 2 mixed drinks while looking at the menu.  Took us a while to get bread but oh well. We ordered and it took about half an hour for our food to arrive with the bread long gone and water nearly empty. Only 2 of the orders arrived but I assumed the other 2 would follow shortly. WRONG. We patiently waited about 15-20 minutes for the other half of our party's food to arrive. No apologies or updates were given. My steak was cool ( even with the waiting, much cooler than expected) and undercooked. I requested medium well and it came medium rare. I attempted to force a few bites down because I NEVER send food back for fear of retribution. Couldn't do it so I requested a different order. Waitress seemed the tiniest bit bothered but she put the order in and I waited an additional 25 minutes for my meal with no water. I don't think anyone got refills.  It didn't seem that busy, but who knows? Seemed like the visit lasted forever, especially with no water. We won't be back here unless it's for Cheesecake to go. BAD SERVICE."
Irma E.,"Tarzana, CA",89,152,25,4.0,4/12/2007,I love food...and it's close to my house so I would recommend that if anybody wants to eat here then go early!!! Go during the week...WEEKENDS it's packed!!! You'll be waiting for over 2 hours on the weekend...HATE IT!!! Food is great! Salads are great! Deserts are great! The food is a good amount! You'll have left overs to take home! =) That's what I love....!  Pricing is good...not expensive . This is a nice place to have nice date or family night...Then you can walk off that cheesecake by walking around....they have great stores to just look in and be nosey! =)
Joseph K.,"Los Angeles, CA",91,176,6,1.0,4/29/2007,"You start by walking past the hordes of kids, grandmothers, mothers yelling at kids, waiters and hostesses barking orders at such earsplitting levels it feels like an AC/DC party hosted by a middle school punk rocker hoping to start a band in his garage. The cherry on the sundae is the music, which is mercifully drowned by the patrons' squeals. Then you sit down. The menu isn't a menu - it's a binder of about twelve pages, not including the pages devoted to the weekend family packages offered at the Palms resort. In the ""menu"" you'll find ungodly concoctions that taste and sound like a Steve Martin comedy made for Showtime. ""Tex Mex Eggrolls"" ""Buffalo Blasts"" ""Roadside Sliders.""  A soft drink comes in cups that rival a 44oz Double Gulp Jug from 7-11. Refills are included. The main courses then. From what I tasted: Thai Chicken Pasta - an almost vile pound of food on your plate - heavy on peanuts, sauce, and oil, something a replacement chef at TGI Fridays can toss together with both eyes closed.. The orange chicken arrives with the pieces of chicken gliding and glistening on top of one another, an artery clogging mound of overglazed, oversweetened batter. The cheesecake is good though."
Cash Spender 1.,"West Covina, CA",1,10,,1.0,3/10/2013,"Taste like factory food! Ordered the avocado wraps as appetizer and bbq chicken pizza. they were decent... the pizza was bland and only tasted like bbq..no spices, no taste of cheese..just blah. but the worst was feeling rushed out from the waitress and i had half my meal on my plate still..we were a group of 12 but did not receive kind hospitality but they felt ok to include !8% gratuity although it wasnt merited. Overpriced! Bland! and no hospitality! ..never again going to eat at a factory that happens to have cheesecake their."
Leona S.,"Los Angeles, CA",407,622,664,4.0,8/5/2010,"I love the Cheesecake Factory, I don't care what anyone says about chain restaurants. They got all sorts of dishes, kinda pricey but totally shareable and such huge portions! They're consistent and delicious and always fills you up. The service is always pretty great, and of course, the cheesecakes are awesome too! Taking off 1 star for its long waits!"
M. G.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,55,2,1.0,3/3/2011,"I'll stick a needle in my eye before I waste nearly two hours waiting for a table.  Are they giving away free food?  No.  Is it cool to huddle together with a bunch of Old Town Pasadena hipsters who obviously have no taste or do not value their precious time?  No.  Get in your car, drive two miles down the road and eat at New Delhi Palace."
Nez P.,"Eagle Rock, CA",99,107,,2.0,2/8/2010,"Eh, 2.5 stars. But I'm rounding down. I was never a big fan of Cheesecake Factory, and had only been there once or twice before. But when my friend suggested it, I thought, ""why not give it another try?""  We came the night of the Superbowl, so the place was not ridiculously busy. In fact, it was kind of empty. However, this did not stop our host from making us wait 10-15 minutes while they ""fixed our table"". Yeah right. So they finally sat us down, and our server approached us a few minutes later. She asked if we were ready to order and I replied with, ""I think we need a few more minutes to decide"". She had this impatient, frustrated look on her face and said, ""Oh you need more time?"" like that was the most ridiculous request she had ever heard. So both my friends ordered drinks and we started off with avocado egg rolls for appetizer. I remembered how much I liked it at BJ's and wanted to try their version here. Ehh, BJ's was definitely way better. Then we ordered our main entrees. I got the Cajun Jambalaya, because I had read on Yelp that a lot of people liked it and it also said on the menu that it was their most popular pasta dish. It was A-Ok. I'm not a big fan. In fact, I only ate about 1/4 of it because the portion was huge. None of my friends finished their food either. I ordered a tropical martini (Absolut vodka with pineapple, mango, and one other fruit) , which I expected to be fruity and fresh. It was a tad on the sweet side, like candy, so I didn't enjoy it too much. It actually tasted better to me once the ice melted and watered it down. We finished off with tiramisu cheesecake, which I surprisingly liked. I would've liked to try their red velvet cheesecake with white chocolate (the actual name escapes me), but I know that I wouldn't have been able to finish it by myself. Overall, I don't think I would ever come back to Cheesecake Factory. I mean, I suppose its okay. Its just not my cup of tea."
Ana H.,"Los Angeles, CA",43,40,5,5.0,10/12/2012,its like any other ... but i am just in love with the Alfredo sauce yummmmm.... the waitresses are really friendly!
Crystal C.,"Los Angeles, CA",9,149,2489,3.0,10/9/2008,"I love their cajun chicken ""littles"" it's always cooked right, comes in a big portion and it's great for sharing. The wait here it always a buzz kill but that's a good sign since their busy. I remember for a friend's birthday, for a table of 8 on a Friday night, we waited 2 hours, ugh that was horrible. The service here is always a coin toss, lately it's been bad, wait 20 mins for the waiter to come back to take our order. The Godiva chocolate cheesecake is really good, super chocolaty and very rich."
Cynthia L.,"Pasadena, CA",803,954,2016,3.0,7/13/2008,"This is one of my least favorite Cheesecake Factory locations.  The wait is usually unbearable with my 90 minutes free parking ticking away.   But despite the wait, I do love their menu and I must always order a few of the following: Crusted Chicken Romano, Miso Salmon, Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp, Avocado Eggrolls, Spinach and Cheese Dip, or Fresh Banana Cream Cheesecake."
Lana L.,"Los Angeles, CA",10,848,62,1.0,10/14/2007,"This is like any other normal american sit down restaurant. Crazy, loud, large portion of food. The only disappointment I realized was that, the more I go to this one, the more oily my food is. Even when I order the exact same thing. As great as the food is, my stomach wouldn't say the same thing since after my meal, I feel like I'm going to puke all over the place. On top of that, this is probably one of the worst place to go to for someone trying to go on a diet."
Lisa L.,"Pasadena, CA",0,27,1,4.0,4/6/2011,"If they don't have it, it might not exist.  I can not believe how big the menu is!  When a place has a huge menu the food usually isn't that good.  How can it be when you try to specialize in so many things.  I have to say however, their food is SOLID.  You get just what the menu says...and it's good.  I guess that's why there is usually a line to get a table."
Oriana C.,"San Mateo, CA",453,352,15,3.0,7/20/2010,"I like Cheesecake Factory, but I don't care for this location too much.  It was super packed, and we were seated by the windows, even though I asked NOT to! HOW RUDE! I don't like people watching me eat as they are walking by!!! Anyway, the food is decent, the Cheesecake is Delicious! LOVEEES the oreo and Carmel pie! Oh MY."
Kevin S.,"Valencia, CA",11,116,17,1.0,1/7/2008,"When many people think of dining in Pasadena, they think of Old Town and places like The Cheesecake Factory.  It's a shame too, because Old Town is basically a tourist trap with large, soulless chain restaurants (like The Cheesecake Factory).  Pasadena is known for it's eclectic collection of first class eats - the important thing to note is that these places aren't in Old Town. The Cheesecake Factory is not worth the long wait, heavy crowds, loud atmosphere, and high prices.   The corporate designed food often arrives cold because your server is just too damn busy trying to help everyone.  To make matters worse, locals will curse you silently as you and your dinner party clog the sidewalk/corner while waiting for your table. Pasadena has so much to offer, don't waste your time with The Cheesecake Factory."
Regina F.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,7,,5.0,5/15/2011,"Great meal, great service! Love the wheat bread. The best!"
Mary C.,"Glendora, CA",82,60,,4.0,5/18/2008,"I've honestly never tasted a Cobb salad like the one offered at the Cheesecake factory.  It has chicken breast, avocado, blue cheese, bacon, egg and lettuce.  You might say...""what's so special about this Cobb salad...it sounds fairly ordinary.""  Well....it's the QUALITY of each ingredient that makes the salad.  Trust me..I've had the Cobb at many places and I will confess, hands down, (where did that saying come from anyways? hehe) that the cheesecake Factory has the best one. Plus..it's huge so you will take some home to eat the next day...which I don't recommend cause salad gets soggy ...so convince a friend to share it with you.  What exactly do you have to lose? ;) Now....I'm a little bit discouraged about the service.  I had heard that each waiter is only given 4 tables so that they can attend the needs of the people. (Is that true?)  However...I think I saw my waiter 3 times....once he got my order ( and only after I flagged him down) then he brought us our food ( a million hours later) and then after I flagged him down again he gave us our bill...hmmm...I think that diet coke was never refilled.... oh well...  I just take off one star for that...not a big loss for the Cheesecake Factory..hehe"
Elon M.,"Los Angeles, CA",15,72,42,3.0,2/23/2007,"This place is always packed, and the line is too long. So when you get sitted you are already starving to death. Then another 1 hour wait for the food to come. When the food arrive, your appetite is gone. I think they should do something with the kitchen assembly so the turn around of food will be faster.  This restaurant is over rated and the food is over priced. The room is dark you cannot see the food, it's like eating spaghetti inside the movie house. If I will go here again, I'll just have appetizer and wine. This is a feel good place, not really a place to dine. It's like wearing a Louis Vuitton in the Metro train or bus.  I love their cheesecake, the best! I'll get it at Ralps, the line is shorter, express check-out!"
Neeek C.,"Covina, CA",36,143,214,3.0,7/24/2011,I got the Louisiana Chicken Pasta (Dinner Size) it was pretty filling and sort of spicy. I am sure it wasn't really spicy but I m used to not eating spicy food so maybe that's why it was spicy. Couldn't finish the whole thing so I would recommend the lunch portion. Busy on Sunday mornings =[
William Y.,"Alhambra, CA",20,149,,2.0,7/18/2010,"I have always enjoyed by dining experience at the Cheesecake Factory and the Pasadena location is one we usually go to.  I was extremely disappointed with the food last night.  I had the steak special, medium rare.  I think I would have had a better steak at Sizzler.  My wife had the chicken salad special and we were looking for the chicken.  I guess business is down and unfortunately the quality of of meals was less than satisfying.  Service was great and our servicer made a bad meal taste a little better."
Claire C.,"Los Angeles, CA",23,19,,4.0,2/22/2011,"So many options here! I don't even really like cheesecake that much, but I love the Cheesecake Factory because they have lots of choices and their portions are HUGE (which means lots of yummy leftovers for later)!  Their menu reads like a mini book so the downside is that it takes about twenty minutes to ever decide what I actually want to order.  Thankfully they always have really good bread to munch on while I debate my decision, but I'm yet to be disappointed by their menu selections whether it be their salads (they have this one great salad with like ten different things in it which is awesome!), pizzas, burgers, entrees, or desserts (hello seven layer chocolate cake which is heavenly!).  Again, you really can't go wrong here. Couple of other thoughts...like most CF locations, its situated right near some excellent shopping on Colorado Blvd in Pasadena because if you go during the peak hours you should expect a very long wait till you're actually seated, so plan accordingly."
