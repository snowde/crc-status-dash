Leslie P.,"San Clemente, CA",10,27,10,3.0,9/12/2010,You know- all they really do well at any of these places is the cheesecake.  Service was good so can't blame them but the menu is just too all over the place to be good.
E p.,"Los Angeles, CA",46,17,4,2.0,1/2/2009,"In short, do not waste your time either in line waiting for a seat here, or even reading too many reviews about this place...it's a chain restaurant of which you cannot expect too much from. The endless menu options (as usual) only indicate they cannot make one thing right.  The food, is mediocre at most. The service though friendly is over-the-top, with un-knowledgeable staff trained only to sell. The decor of the place is horrid and disney-esque, yet foreshadows the food that is to come.  Though a good place for large groups who cannot coincide on a common dinning option (or families with kids), skip this place if you can."
Cate T.,"Los Angeles, CA",53,334,665,2.0,8/7/2008,"This place gets so ungodly busy so bloody often that I try to avoid going here! I don't go often, though I did go here for my 21st birthday. I went with my mom. yeah. I know. sounds lame, but  her birthday is the day before mine, and I thought we could both do with a treat that was just the two of us. The service was really good that night, but most other times, it's just a pain going here, especially with everyone and their grandmother's dog showing up to this place. I prefer to go to Barney's Beanery if the Factory is crowded, or maybe grab something from Aux Delices or go to the Johnny Rockets across the street that's hidden away."
Tony Y. Jr. Y.,"Glendale, CA",63,490,1443,3.0,4/16/2009,"The Cheesecake Factory was my favorite restaurant for years.  To date, I prefer the location in Beverly Hills, as the service and food is highly acceptable.  Though the Pasadena Cheesecake Factory is closer to me, I don't prefer to dine at this location.  I dined here for a quick lunch today and, surprisingly, it wasn't crowded.  So, why did it take so long for my food to arrive?  As you walk into this particular restaurant, no one greets you, and most of the staff are fairly young and don't seem to care about etiquette.  The staff has a tendency to communicate amongst themselves quite a bit here.  I actually had to inform the waiter that I was ready to order because he was so engaged in another conversation.  The food here is not as good as at the other Cheesecake Factory locations.  For example, my rice usually comes with parsley on top and the chicken is laid on a bed of lettuce but, I didn't receive any of that here.  With service as slow as it was, I didn't ponder sending my food back for replacement.  Well, I've heard this location may be closing, so maybe that's why some of these workers have such a lackadaisical attitude."
Jennifer H.,"San Francisco, CA",296,525,4,3.0,6/26/2007,"This was the first C.F. I ever stepped foot into (many moons ago) and after having done so, I swore it would be my last, BUTTTT...I gave in to my friend when she asked to go there again soon thereafter. This time I liked it and have since eaten at many other locations.  This one gets SUPER DUPER packed though (if you can imagine), the wait here is insane!  But if you can sit by the window it's nice, you get to see all the hustle and bustle of the people walking by."
BustA G.,"Pasadena, CA",397,187,224,5.0,3/30/2008,"I remember when I lived in the Inland Empire and when we drove down to Pasadena, I always wanted to go to the Cheesecake Factory.  I love the decor and the food.  If I could, I'd give this place a ""10"".   Since we live in Pasadena, I've gone here more often with my family.  Cheesecake Facory does accept reservations for Sunday Brunch if you make a reservation for dining before 10:30 am.  After that you'll have to stand in line with the rest of the herds of folks.  My personal favorites are the Firecracker Salmon Roll; strawberry lemonade; sourdough bread and the shrimp with fetuccine.  I'd love to be able to have my daughter's wedding reception here -- when that time comes, of course.   I went here with a large group back in December 2006.  The Cheesecake Factory's waiting area is usually VERY crowded, especially during this time of year.   I had been waiting a few doors down @ the Apple store before heading back to The Cheesecake Factory look out for our group.  One of our table mates became quite enthused when guests at other tables began to sing ""Happy Birthday"" to their guests of honor that she starting singing ""Happy Birthday"" and the rest of our table joined in too.  It was a good night (only because I had to go to work afterwards) with a nice, personable group of folks :)"
C P.,"Los Angeles, CA",18,272,3,4.0,7/22/2008,"I haven't been any CF since my trip to Boston years ago. I pass by this one almost once a week but the line is always long and it isn't really that exciting a place to hang out with the local folks.  It's different when it comes to friends from out of town. It was remarkable that it only took us 10 minutes to get a table on a Sunday evening. Service was good. Loved the salmon salad. My best friend makes the best shepherd pie but the one we had at CF that evening wasn't too bad either. The cheesecake? Could be better, could be worse. I liked what we ordered anyway."
Tanisha H.,"Long Beach, CA",47,97,2,2.0,3/10/2010,"This is strictly about the service, because, come on, the Cheesecake Factory, always good. But we were sat at a section where i could see my waiter twiddling his thumbs and bumping his gums while i waited for service. I know it gets busy, but really?"
Teresa B.,"Pasadena, CA",440,304,466,5.0,3/13/2009,"It's called the The Cheesecake Factory, so that's all I'll be rating. I am a huge fan of their ""healthy"" lo-carb cheesecake. First of all, I make it a point to walk a few miles to order my two slices to go. Lo-carb does not mean it's not loaded with fattening sour cream, cream cheese and eggs. Most importantly to me is that it is sugar free. Once I get home I'll indulge in one slice and save the other in my freezer for a special occasion. I have been on a lo-carb diet for 7 years and the diet cheesecake is truly a decadent treat. I used to have to forgo dessert, not anymore."
Jack K.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,7,2,4.0,8/10/2010,"The food is great, the drinks are stiff and the service is good. However this location is too busy  (the wait can be ridiculously long at times, 1.5 hours +) and it can be entirely too noisy."
G W.,"Manassas, VA",350,478,215,1.0,2/10/2010,"HELL HOLE!!!! Dirty napkins, dirty silverware, dirty glasses! The mojitos were bomb! Bad service! Bad food...yes really!!! Never had an experience quite like this for a Cheesecake Factory Restaurant! Rats and Roaches eat well here you won't."
Cleo M.,"Oakland, CA",109,144,5,3.0,12/7/2006,"it's nice little place to eat at Wait is god awful long. the last time i went with friends and one of their mothers after a day of shopping - I couldn't stand the noise in the little lobby area so my friend and i step out and go to the victoria's across the street. We just happened to see Black Thought from the Roots, we chopped it up with him like old times ( we didn't know each other like that but who cares). After our conversations and quick look to Vicky's we headed back to the packed lobby. Finally got our table, I don't recalled what I ordered, assuming it couldn't have been that bombed if I don't reckon what my tastebuds felt like. I can say I enjoyed the tortas with the sour cream and salsa(overpriced, you can get a box for the same price of the 4 they charge you). I know just don't order the nachos - not very delish and crispier than a stale tortilla chip."
S. S.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,89,,4.0,3/10/2008,"This review is for one specific dish. The Miso Salmon is fantastic.   I will put up with the noise and the wait and the parking for this tender, melt-in-your mouth salmon on a bed of rice with pea pods and miso glaze."
Ernesto Q.,"San Francisco, CA",8,13,10,2.0,4/8/2008,"I really love The Cheesecake Factory, but this location sucks. My server and my host were really nice but the two people who brought out our food were terrible. To start with they looked really unhappy. When I asked a question about the food one of them stared blankly at me and the other just strait out said I DON'T KNOW. I thought they paid big money to train the Cheesecake Factory team? Almost every meal I have ever had at a Cheesecake Factory has been good. I decided to try the Vegetable Chopped Salad. It sounded really good on the menu but in real life it was kind of gross and not worth the price. It was supposed to have asparagus in the salad; you seriously had to search for the four tiny pieces that they put in this salad. The dressing was really nasty. When I tried to ask questions and voice my concern with the salad the staff had nothing to say. They did not offer me something else, they did not offer to take it off my bill even though it was clear I did not eat very much of it. I love the sweet corn tamale cakes. Such a great sauce and amazingly fresh avocado on top... but this time they were cold in the middle. Usually they are great about refilling your ice tea or Arnold Palmer's but not this location.  I hope this was just a bad day for this crew because the Pasadena location is on a great street to hang out and I would hate to have to skip one chain restaurant I normally enjoy."
T S.,"Pasadena, CA",13,209,33,4.0,10/21/2009,"They have a huge selection and provide nutritional information.  I just started a new diet and there are plenty of things I can eat there.  I tried the grilled salmon and ahi tuna salad in two different visits.  The grilled salmon is average, nothing spectacular.  But the ahi salad was really good and low in calories.  My husband really likes the dark bread there and sometimes we will visit the place just to buy some bread.  There is usually a line during the weekend, which is annoying."
jeremy t.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,11,,4.0,6/18/2008,"Tips from a former Employee of this location:  If you're going on a weekend night, go early (5:30 or earlier) or late (10 or later) or risk getting caugth in the ""refugee camp"" outside, some waiting up to 3 hours for a table. Sometimes you get lucky. I tend to go to Louise's Trattoria across the street, have a fantabulous dinner and see the same people waiting outside when I leave. Is the wait worth it? That's for you to decide.  The food is the richest, most fattening food I've ever served (my server career ended 7 years ago). It's also some of the most delicious. They have a special ""lab"" out in Woodland Hills to create the dishes including new cheesecakes. I'm not going to give away corporate secrets but 2 specialty cheesecake has 3000 calories, 150 grams of fat and 75 or 80 grams of saturated fat. And it's out of this world! There's a reason CCF doesn't disclose nurtitional information on pretty much all of it's items.  For those who haven't been, the portions are huge enough to satisfy even the large SUV set. When my partner and I go, we usually order 1 appetizer, 1 salad, 1 entree and a dessert. We always take food home when we do this.  Another hint: If you're craving CCF but don't want to go through the wait, order to go and pick it up at the front.  My one gripe about this location is that it's the smallest location except Beverly Hills (the original). They should have leased the space next door and maybe the refugee camp would be smaller. Sometimes it covers the entire southwest corner of Colorado and Fair Oaks as well as wrapping around the sides. Now with the CCF locations opened in Glendale and Arcadia, we'll see how the business holds up.  Imitators be damned (Granville..cough), this is the original ""coffee shop for rich people"". I swear that's their original concept . Loosen your belts and prepare for a great meal."
Lilly N.,"Los Angeles, CA",48,218,42,4.0,11/5/2009,I came here with a friend during lunch. He got the Alfredo pasta with chicken and I got the Chicken Caesar salad (I wanted to small one I thought it was a side order kinda thing). We also got the fried mac and cheese ohh that can never go wrong!! YUMM!!!!! So when we got our bill it was about 30 bucks decent. But I was kinda disappointed because I had asked for a small salad but he gave me the lunch portion one. This always happens to me what is wrong with people.. ughh but overall the food was great..
N R.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,14,,3.0,6/13/2012,"This was my 4th time at a Cheesecake factory, there isn't one where I live, I absolutely love the place everytime I go. The food is always really good and of course i love the cheesecake. Upon entering there's no one waiting and we are automatically greeted at the counter. I ask for a table for 3 and the two hosts proceed to argue about who's going to seat use each one not wanting to do it, they were talking pretty low unaware we were able to hear there entire conversation. That kind of set a bad tone for me for the rest of the meal but i have to say the waiter and food were wonderful like always."
Carline A.,"Alhambra, CA",50,2,1,2.0,2/3/2008,"This place is over-hyped and overpriced.  The pastas are disgustingly drenched in oil. Good oil (virgin olive) or bad (canola), it's an incessant pool of slow, indigestible scum in your tum.   There's a lot of waiting involved, so CF is a no-go if your movie starts in a half hour or if you're simply impatient. On any given weekend night (starting Friday) ESPECIALLY, you might be waiting anywhere from 30 minutes - 2 hours. No joke. It also takes awhile for a server to take your order (especially if you have an indecisive party) and another two years for your drinks and food to come. Maybe its just me, but I'm paranoid over extremely dim-lighting. The place is lit by candles, so I wonder why appetizers are still $12+? Don't even get me started with the prices for drinks... The cheesecakes live up to their name and the tiramisu is very moist because of the rum but that $9 piece of heaven can burn like hell in your pocket. Go to CPK instead."
Karina P.,"Denver, CO",80,13,3,3.0,2/2/2009,"I'm a huge fan of The Cheesecake Factory. However, this last time we went was not so great. We were seated in front of a large party, and the waitress complete ignored us. We never had our drinks refilled. My friend couldn't finish her meal because she had asked for a condiment to eat her fries with and they never brought it. I went to the front to complain and they sent over the manager. She offered us 2 cheesecakes on the house for the inconvenience. There were four of us so we had to share. Sweet manager, and I'm glad they gave us free cheesecake. Hopefully I have a better experience next time."
