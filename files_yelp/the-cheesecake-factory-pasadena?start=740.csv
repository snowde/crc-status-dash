Claudia Le Bebe V.,"Downey, CA",4,13,1,2.0,6/20/2009,"I came here two times and both of those times weren't very good, just ok. The first time I went I order pot stickers that were very sweet tasting and a long island ice tea that was so water down I didn't taste any of the alcohol. Second time I order the tons of fun burger and it was so salty and and onion rings were so weak, thin and burned. I love the cheesecake factory but not this location. I suggest that if you are around Pasadena to check out the one located in Arcadia (15 Min's away), that location cooks the food waaaaaay better than this location!"
Jason L.,"West Hollywood, CA",4,11,,3.0,1/20/2008,"I had lunch there in the past few days (January 15, 2008) with a friend.  I generally like their food although I like continental food.  I was displeased but pleasant when I found a hair in my food from the kitchen (please wear hair nets).  I did not ask for anything free and received the bill and was charged twice for the salmon and then when I asked about it, the waitress told me that they had ""comped"" the second fish due to the hair in the first fish.   I paid the bill and left.  It would have been a nice gesture to pay for my martini or something a my 40 minute lunch took almost 90 minutes due to the kitchen having to cooking a new fish.  I guess I assumed that honey would work better than vinegar with the staff.   On later reflection, I think that my friend's annoyance with the service may have colored my opinion more than usual.  It is the Cheesecake Factory and everyone makes mistakes.  I guess it was a surprise for a regularly decent restaurant."
Vin P.,"Rosemead, CA",21,118,7,3.0,6/30/2007,"Personally, I think this place is overrated...Everytime I come here, it is always packed...and I can't understand why? The food is good, but not that good, the service is okay at times, and the ambiance is nice, but you will find an intimate setting in any of these types of restaurants. So, what makes this place so popular??? I have absolutely no idea...someone tell me please. Even if you make a reservation, you still have to wait about 10-15 minutes. What's up with that? What the heck makes this place so freakin popular??? Location, Location, Location. Since I am a real estate agent, I figure that the location of this place is FANTASTIC!!! Right in the heart of Downtown Pasadena, where can you go wrong? All you have to do is have a brand name restaurant with some above average food and okay service...BAM, you have a winner. I give props to the owner...but I still think this place is OVERRATED! Love the cheesecakes though."
Alina K.,"Northridge, CA",20,24,,3.0,11/11/2011,"The food tastes great! But the service is terrible! My friend and I sat waiting for a good 10 minutes with absolutely no service, even though the restaurant was half empty. Even the host who seated us said that business was slow at the moment. So I started to poke my head out of our booth looking for any waiter passing by. One male waiter walked by and saw me and gave this BS comment that our waiter was on his way. How would he know? He wasn't even waiting in our section. After another 10 minutes of poking my head out and no waiter, the bartender came to us and started our order. Apparently she saw me doing my head poke out dance and decided she needed to do something about our section's terrible service. I wish I could have given all of our tip to her since she did a fantastic job with service and waiting. Oh, cheesecake.. you've disappointed me with your raised prices and terrible service."
Rosie H.,"Alhambra, CA",2,70,62,3.0,9/26/2011,"Had lunch at Cheesecake today.  It was a busy Saturday afternoon so we expected a wait.  The hostess quoted us a 10 minute wait, but ended up being closer to 20.  It wouldn't have been so bad except other parties that came after us got seated before us...not cool.  Anyway, during our wait Jermaine Jackson walked in....Jermaine Jackson at Cheesecake Factory?  Weird, I know. But true.  Like I said, we finally got seated after our 20 minutes.  Took another 5 minutes for our waiter to greet us and left.  Man!  We were already locked and loaded to order. But no...had to wait another 5 minutes just to ask for our drinks.  Let's just say this little dance went on like this the entire meal.  Our food came about 25 minutes after our order was placed.  Food was good--sweet corn tamale cakes as an ""appetizer"".  The portion was much larger than I remember and can definitely be a meal in itself.  We also has the lunch size miso salmon.  Yum!!!  If you haven't had the miso glazed salmon or even if you are not a fan of fish, ya gotta try it.  Thank goodness the food was worth the wait, otherwise I would have dropped one star."
Fatty N.,"Rosemead, CA",12,134,3,3.0,12/11/2009,"I tend to always order the jambalay pasta when i go which is always good to me. I like spicy.  My wife ordered the wasabi seared tuna which we took home as leftovers and turned it into Wasabi jambalaya tuna pasta dish.  Damn i'm a good chef.  OH MY LORD, the grilled artichoke was delicious.  I went home and tried to copy it and came close."
PictureGirl F.,"Long Beach, CA",41,166,9,4.0,11/9/2008,"I ordered my staples and they were fantastic as always.  The chop salad, fried macaroni and cheese, and a super duper tasty slice of banana cheesecake for dessert!   We didn't have to wait that long for a table and it was a Thursday evening.  Typically I have to wait about an hour whenever I dine at the San Francisco location.  Obviously the cheesecake makes it worth the wait!   If by some slim chance you have never dined here, stop on by!"
Stefan D.,"San Diego, CA",0,35,,2.0,5/11/2012,"Disappointed with quality of food on last two visits. Dry, bland waffle on one occasion and mushy flavorless fish & chips on the next. Service was  friendly and competent."
Madison M.,"Sherman Oaks, CA",0,30,,5.0,4/23/2010,Yum Yum yum.   great food. great service. love the salmon.
MIKE B.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",27,38,,5.0,11/8/2009,"Me and my family really love this chain.  It really does not get any better than this restaurant for quality and variety.  I usually tell diners to choose only from 2 or 3 items on the menu of most restaurants to avoid disappointment, but CCF is an exception to my rule. I have eaten countless dishes on their menu and been pleasantly surprised with the wonderful meals each time. However, I would be shortchanging new diners if I did not mention what I love most on their menu which includes: Cajun Jambalaya Pasta-unbelievable Crusted Chicken Romano-again YUM Cajun Chicken Littles-Best chicken fingers on the planet BBQ Ribs-OMG great! Renee's Special-Soup,Salad,Sandwich-have it on Saturday with the Chicken soup(Sat Only) and your soul will thank you. Pizza-great Steaks-surprisingly great! You can't go wrong with the great food, huge portions, and the beautiful space you are eating within. The service is usually really good too, however I have had a few bums as servers.  The good thing is the manager has comped us completely on those occasions. This place is a real winner, eat there as much as possible, we do!"
Ume B.,"Los Angeles, CA",11,201,2,2.0,3/22/2009,"The food is alright, but it seems like the service gets worse and worse, and the wait gets longer and longer.  It's like you have to beg someone to bring you some water.  I'd probably die from dehydration if Cheesecake Factory was a desert."
Joy C.,"Los Angeles, CA",548,81,23,3.0,6/20/2009,"What can I say? This place is a bit overrated. The wait to get a table is really loong when you come at rush hour. The service is nice, though. The food is really not to my taste. To me, it's really heavy, and after eating 5 bites of it, you're pretty much good to go. The cheesecake, on the other hand. is good. It's the best cheesecake in town. After my experience at the Cheesecake Factory, I think the only time I'll come back is for cheesecake."
Kaily L.,"PORTER RANCH, CA",3,10,,2.0,1/16/2012,"he service here stunk.  the waiter screwed up the simple things I asked him to do.  the food was ok, the atmosphere was ok...... I would go back only if I got a different waiter."
Ro D.,"Los Angeles, CA",95,229,36,4.0,4/28/2009,"Good ol' chain restaurants. I try to stay away, but sometimes you just have to give in. And why not to the Cheesecake Factory? Their menu is extreme - which means everyone in your party will, at the least, find something they don't completely hate. Personally, I'm a fan of the Jamaican Jerk Chicken with black beans, rice, and plantains. (On a side-note, the Cheesecake Factory at the Americana has a bartender who is a dead ringer for Ed Norton. Just so that you know.)"
Marissa W.,"South Pasadena, CA",0,7,,5.0,2/1/2014,"My daughter has food allergies, and going to restaurants can be frustrating because many waiters get irritated at the time that it takes to check to make sure that the foods we are ordering are safe for her. The waiter that we had at this Cheesecake Factory was AMAZING! He was friendly, quick, attentive to our needs, kind... and most of all... after we told him about my daughters allergies, he continued to check things for her allergens on his own, before we asked him to do so. We had not been so pleased with a dining experience in a very long time... in fact, we were so impressed with him we gave him a 75% tip and wrote him a note of thanks on the receipt. My husband and I were both servers when we were going though school, and we appreciate how hard the service industry can be... although we do not have a lot of money now, we like to occasionally leave very large tips for servers that go above and beyond. We had a wonderful experience at this restaurant... but I have to say that it was mostly just because we really appreciated our server. The food was great as well... but just typical of every other Cheesecake Factory."
Lucy R.,"La Crescenta-Montrose, CA",0,72,40,5.0,10/17/2011,"The Cheesecake Factory is by far my favorite chain restaurant.  It is actually the place I choose when it's my night to choose dinner.  Service is usually good, but having worked there, allows me to understand the pressure that goes along with the job... it definitely was one of the more demanding serving jobs I have had.   When you first arrive they give you wheat and sourdough bread with butter, the wheat bread is the best I've ever had, it's best fresh when it's warm and soft.  My favorite dishes include the spicy chicken chipotle pasta which has a great smokey flavor, the asperagus and peppers and crunchy tortilla strips add a great contrast in texture.  The chicken piccata is also one of my favoirtes, I just have to order extra sauce because it can be dry at times... the capers, mushrooms and angel hair pasta are great in the dish.  The steak diane had a good sweetness to it, the steak is always tender.  I love the fact that my son gets their grilled chicken with spinach whenever we go, he is normally a chicken tender kid, but enjoys the grilled chicken here.  All their portions are huge, even their lunch portions.  My husband and I always split so we can try to save room for dessert.  Occassionally we'll get one meal and split between my husband, son and I and we are still left full and having to get our dessert to go.  Even their cups of soups are hearty meals. Although it is famous for their cheesecakes, I have to admit that my favorite dessert is the Apple Crisp, it's so warm and sweet and the ice cream melts and the whole dish tasts creamy, I love it. The fresh banana cheesecake is surprisingly refreshing and light, I'm not even a banana fan and I love this cheesecake.  The white chocolate raspberry cheesecake is good too, I'm not a white chocolate fan, but it's not bad for having white chocolate shavings on it.  Their black tie is really good and their chocolate cakes with ice cream are great to take home and have for breakfast. I know they really like to try to be consistent in all aspects, but it's not always the case, but their food is good enough to keep coming back.  We've never had a bad thing on the menu and although the prices seem high, the fact that the meals are big enough to split and have left overs compensates for it.  I would gladly pay $16 for a pasta dish because it can feed two of us and we often have left overs for one of us for the following day."
Jackie A.,"Glendale, CA",0,5,,4.0,1/26/2012,"I love this resturant, but my favorite location is in pasadena! nice people, and great service. My favorite salad there is the chines chicken salad...Mmmmm just thinking about it makes me want to go this weekend. Love the place and the food :)"
Tim H.,"Chino, CA",0,45,4,5.0,10/30/2011,"I honestly didn't have high hopes from the cheesecake factory after hearing things from other people. I've had their cheesecake many times, and it is delicious and will shorten your life by a few days. However, this was my first time eating actual food there. We went there with a large group of 10 people October 1st. Now I thought we were going to get terrible service because we went in at almost midnight (they close at 12:30). In reality it was just the opposite. We were seated promptly. Our waiter was friendly, attentive, and had an amazing memory. I had a hamburger, it was pretty good. Everyone's food came out super hot. I didn't have to bug our waiter for anything - 10 people and he's keeping drinks full and fulfilling other requests - amazing. The food is probably only a 4 star, but the excellent service brings this place up to a 5. We didn't leave til almost 2am and not once did someone try to rush us out or hurry us in ANY way. I made sure the waiter and his manager know what an excellent job they did.  I will definitely go to cheesecake factory again because of the stellar service."
M S.,"Monterey Park, CA",31,239,1,2.0,6/20/2008,"Have you been there before? So you've seen the amount of people waiting. Do you think it's lame? Are we all in agreement here? I'd like to take a vote on how many people don't think it's worth the wait. There are 50 other places to eat in the area. But you'd rather wait an hour on that street corner, standing around, waiting, blocking the sidewalk, waiting. Trust me, the food ain't that good. It's comfortable, I get it, believe me. But sometimes you have to step out of your comfort zone, take a risk, try the walking around the block and eating somewhere you've never been. I can't tell you how many times I've passed people on that street corner, went to eat somewhere, and returning from dinner crossing the same people, waiting at the same street corner an hour later....they must be hungry"
Guy S.,"Los Angeles, CA",401,219,137,3.0,12/28/2008,"Lunch at cheesecake is actually pretty decent. Their lunch specials that is. My friend got the lunch portion of the BBQ Chicken Salad and I swear it looked the same as the regular portion. Totally worth it. I got one of their new items, as if Cheesecake Factory really needs to ADD items to their already endless menu. It was called the Caramel Chicken. Not a good name if you ask me because it doesn't  taste like caramel one but. It tastes more like an Asian stir fry. Good nonetheless. I totally had room for cheesecake but I didn't wanna dish out the extra $8. Oh well, maybe next time. I was pretty surprised to find out that at lunch the wait was only 5 minutes. That place is usually packed beyond belief."
