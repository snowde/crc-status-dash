K A.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,16,,4.0,7/30/2009,"I have always been a fan of the Cheesecake Factory, and as of yet I have not had a bad experience there (knock on wood).  I like the fact that they have a hugely diverse menu, yet execute everything (at least everything I've personally tried) well.  That is not an easy feat...I know this because I've worked in the restaurant business for almost 6 years...and I watch a lot of Gordon Ramsay.  Anyway, back the subject.  I work right down the street from this particular cheesecake factory, but had yet to venture there.   I decided today would be the day, seeing as how it's National Cheesecake Day, and all the cheesecakes would be half off!  And boy oh boy do I love me some good cheesecake...yum... So I took my favorite guy and we went down to the place, and were seated immediately.  I don't remember my server's name, but he was very nice.  My boyfriend got the peach smoothie, which he talks about whenever the word 'peach' is uttered in his earshot, and which he has been raving to me about for months.  I'm not a huge peach fan, but I could see it's appeal, and it was more than pleased with it.  We got the fried artichoke hearts as an appetizer, they were good, but I thought the dipping sauce was a little bland.  We both decided to be adventurous and try dishes we had never tried there...I usually get the pork chops---sooooo good, or the orange chicken, or the teriyaki chicken.  I settled on the Chicken di panna and he got the Spicy Cashew Chicken.  My chicken was flattened and lightly breaded with a subtle creamy white wine sauce, broccoli, and mashed potatoes.  I don't like my broccoli mushy, but it seemed a little too raw for my liking.  The potatoes were great- I could eat potatoes in any form, I love them so much!  And the chicken was good.  Moist with a nice but not overpowering flavor.  A little lemon on it and it was perfect.   My boyfriend simply adored the Cashew Chicken, it was nice and spicy like he likes it, and the chicken was moist but with just a bit of crunch on the outside.  I tasted some and I have to say I might just order that next time I go there.  He said he liked it more than most chinese places he's had cashew chicken at...I don't know if I'd go that far, but he's white...really white.  But it was good.  Oh, and did I mention the bread?  I love that brown bread with some butter!  We ended the meal with a couple of slices of cheesecake to go...that was the whole point of going anyway.  I am still full from my meal...which I ate 5 hours ago and didn't even finish but brought home in a doggy bag, but I am looking very forward to it!  I got the new Stefani's Red Velvet cheesecake, which combines two of my very favorite desserts and was just debuted today.  I'm sure it will be incredible.  So as for my first experience at this CF...I will definitely go here again."
Aleli C.,"San Dimas, CA",31,29,,2.0,5/29/2007,"It always amazes me how people line up outside on the streets just to get into this restaurant.  Why people dine here, I really don't know, considering how their food is bland and overcooked at best. They could also be held accountable for false advertising:  I ordered the Spinach and Artichoke Dip only to be dismayed that there was no artichoke in the said spinach and artichoke dip. Service is usually so-so, but the last time I was here (which was a few weeks ago), it was particularly bad.  The manager was, perhaps, the nosiest little gopher in the world.  Ian and I had been sitting in the restaurant, starving our not-so-little asses off because our food was taking forever and a day to get to our table.  Manager came over and asked if everything was okay.  I said no because I was cranky from the 30-minute wait and my blood sugar level was running dangerously low.  I had also politely asked him to check up on our food to make sure that it was on its way.  Still, the manager kept insisting that something else was wrong, somehow insinuating that my crankiness wasn't a direct result of their super-slow service.   This made me want to get up and sucker punch the little fucker square in the nose, but I couldn't because again, starvation had sucked out what little energy I had left.  Whatever. When my food finally came to my table, it was half-cold, and my pasta was dry with absolutely no lemon cream sauce on it  (Chicken Piccata).  I was thoroughly disappointed by the way they half-assed my order.  And the waitress ignored me THRICE when I had asked her to fill my water glass up. I will never eat real food at Cheesecake Factory ever again. The place does deserve some kudos, though:  They do have good desserts.  Their strawberry shortcake is tasty, and the cheesecakes, I hear, are satisfying as well. In the end, my lesson learned is to never, ever waste money on anything else but the desserts on The Cheesecake Factory's menu."
Lissette G.,"Burbank, CA",0,18,,4.0,11/10/2011,"the food was great  big portions we got to choose where wanted to sit because some portion of the seating was a bit dark the service was ok, a bit slow but it happens"
wing yee y.,"Alhambra, CA",2,5,2,4.0,9/6/2008,"The service is good and the food is great! It is also a good place for birthday dinners, or dates, and whatnot. They give you birthday sundaes if it's someone's birthday AND they sing. But i love there cheesecake more than sundaes~"
George M.,"Los Angeles, CA",417,655,242,4.0,11/23/2006,"Waiting for a table is for losers. I eat at the bar. The bartender Jerry M. is awesome. He can mix a drink that will keep you buzzed all night and still allow you to drive home. The bar serves the full menu and there is always an empty seat. It is a great place to meet someone for drinks after a long, long day. Plus there's cheesecake!"
pink b.,"Los Angeles, CA",32,161,1,2.0,7/9/2007,This place on a weekend is so packed..not worth the wait...service very slow..when you want a refill on drinks it takes about 30 minutes until you can flag someone down...very crowded..cheesecakes were okay...martini's blah...not out of this site..what else can I say..can't waste typing...yucky....
Carrie V.,"Los Angeles, CA",45,47,,4.0,9/1/2006,"it's a chain restaurant, so it's kinda cheesy, but i love the cheesecake factory.  this one in pasadena is fast and friendly. i'll keep coming here because i love too many things here: the drinks are fantastic, specifically the carribean cooler or the strawberry or pomegrante or chocolate or whatever martini; they have choices for vegetarians and i've found the portabello burger to be exquisite- i even have some non-veg friends addicted to it; and of course the cheesecake is great but by the time i'm done with the other stuff i don't order it. the lines can be long cuz old town, where this is located, can be pretty touristy.  but walk into the bar area and check that first.  i've personally always been able to find a spot there and you still have the full menu available for you.  also, this is the place we pick when someone wants food and the other just wants to drink.  i'm often the drinker part of that scenario while my roomate is the eater and drinker, and the bartender, jerrry, that is there the most often is a super guy with excellent expressions which pleases the people watcher in me."
Sandy P.,"Downey, CA",2,16,,5.0,6/6/2011,"Saturday afternoon,table for 4. We were seated immediately,table was clean set up and ready for us.We ordered 2 appetizers DELICIOUS! Thai chicken fettuccini was'nt my favorite I""ll try something different next time.Pineapple upside-down cheesecake incredible!!! Service was Excellent.Loved It :)"
Armen B.,"CA, CA",87,209,42,3.0,2/12/2007,"Good menu.  Tons of selection. OK service. Extremely busy on weekends.  Clean. Nice ambience.  We like the food here, but hate the wait.  The bar drinks are good and the cheesecake is out of this world.  Menu has everything for anybody.  Prices are reasonable."
Adina C.,"Union City, CA",57,65,4,2.0,8/26/2007,"I think I was punk'd. I saw a huge line, and thought the quality of the food would match the restaurant's popularity. Their overpriced asparagus/sundried tomato/mushroom pasta was basically just pasta and oil with a spare piece of asparagus or two hidden somewhere. The avocado spring rolls were little more than plain, mushy avocado in eggroll (the description made it sound like avocado was only one component of the filling). The mojito I ordered tasted totally virgin, so I didn't even get a buzz to help me forget the food. My husband's pasta (called Evelyn's Favorite) literally tasted like plain noodles with dried oregano sprinkled over it. I would give this one star (or zero), except for the fact that the service truly was excellent. The teenage waiters were very friendly and polite. They deserve the entire cost of the tab, because they were the only thing worthwhile."
Sneha A.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",23,29,,1.0,3/20/2008,"eh, not so much.  sure, if cheesecake is your thing, drop in every once in a great while.  but really now. there are so many other options on colorado blvd. the weekend lines are insane and so not worth it. to me the menu and the portions are reminders of american overkill--a glut of options and everything super-sized."
Maritza C.,"Montebello, CA",21,32,,3.0,4/11/2009,"Expect to wait a while especially for dinner time and on weekends.  I would recommend the popcorn shrimp and chicken piccatta.  I have tried other things but I really don't enjoy them as much as the two above. Of course, try a cheesecake."
Tyrone W.,"New York, NY",266,75,3,5.0,4/7/2011,"i do enjoy this place, whenever i need my Italian food fix, i go here, the prices are fair for the amount of food you get, i can never finish an entire meal by myself, and i can eat, so i eat half for lunch and half for dinner, i love the chicken romano! thank god there is a cheesecake factory so close to where i live!"
steven m.,"Los Angeles, CA",206,25,,1.0,3/29/2009,"What was I doing at the cheesecake factory anyway?  Bland food, sweaty, stressed out waiters, cheesy decor, ridiculous cocktail specials.  Chain restaurants seem to be for people who prefer the security of the familiar over a chance at  the exemplary.  Count me out."
B D.,"Los Angeles, CA",12,108,,2.0,11/18/2008,"This particular location is a hit or miss for both service and food.  The waiters are infamous for swooping in at only two times during your meal -- one to deliver both your drinks and food; the other to run your credit card.  The food is the same -- hit or miss.  I always order the same 4 dishes from Cheesecake -- Pasta Da Vinci, Chicken Piccatta, Crab Cake sandwich, Evelyn's Pasta.   The last time I came here the crab cake sandwich was dry, mealy, and disappointing."
Eric M.,"Altadena, CA",23,9,1,3.0,3/26/2009,"Their menu is full of options, many of the them quite tasty but also somewhat expensive, and how the service goes really depends on when you go. Thursday night at 6? No wait and reasonably attentive service. Friday or weekends? Good luck not being tempted by the shorter lines at the multitude of other restaurants in Old Town, not to mention a similar kind of service inside. It's still a good standby that can cater to many tastes, as well as attracting people for the many types of cheesecake."
Felicia L.,"Louisville, KY",3,38,,4.0,1/23/2009,"Their food is good, its like any other resteraunt, but they give you huge servings. My favorite dessert is the strawberry shortcake. They pile a bunch of sliced strawberries on top of ba biscuity shortcake and vanilla ice cream in the middle. it serves at least 4 people, 2 if you're really hungry!"
Jason G.,"Los Angeles, CA",141,197,1,2.0,4/6/2007,"when i was still in high school or something like that, my sister convinced me to go here having heard all the hype.  So i took a chance.  When the food go to the table, i just staired at the burnt and tasteless food."
Imran M.,"Phoenix, AZ",19,128,3,4.0,7/12/2006,One of the better located Cheesecake Factories in the heart of Old Town Pasadena. Lines are very long though and you may be wise to avoid weekends.
Olivia J.,"Montebello, CA",74,364,73,3.0,6/18/2008,The only reason why I come to Cheesecake Factory is the Shrimp Scampi...mmmm sooo good.  I've been to several of their other locations and the taste is always consistent!  I also love their overpriced cheesecakes...caramel white chocolate macadamia (or something like that) is my pick all the time.  For all locations...the wait just sucks...and the parking is usually the same....The last one I did go to is the one in Arcadia and the wait was not so bad.  I think their service has gone downhill from when I first ate here...many years ago.
