Lily T.,"Alhambra, CA",303,141,12,5.0,4/27/2008,"I love the cheesecake factory! However, if you are trying to watch you weight it is probably not the place for you. The portion are extra large! I went with a girl friend and had the Lalu salad, which is approx. 800 calories and can serve up to 4 individuals. I alone can eat half the salad because it is really really good. I highly recommend the salad if you have never tried it. The other items on the menu is excellent such as the Thai lettuce wrap, sliders, jambalaya's pasta (NOT Rice... PASTA!!) and etc. Remember! it is called the cheesecake factory.. so you can not finish your meal without having one of their famous cheesecake. I personally love the raspberry white chocolate truffle cheesecake."
Tony V.,"San Francisco, CA",14,64,13,3.0,5/11/2008,I come here for the honey wheat bread sticks they serve to you while you wait for your entree.  What else is there to say about this chain except that it's your standard American food served with elegance?
Amanda H.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,34,,1.0,8/20/2008,"I love Cheesecake Factory, but had a terrible experience at this one.  I later learned that my friend that lives in Pasadena drives to Santa Ana if she wants Cesecake Factory instead of going to this one.  We had poor service (slow, wrong food, waited for one person's food for 20 min after the rest of us got our food).  It also smelled like dirty diaper when we walked in."
Andy D.,"North Hollywood, CA",3,49,,2.0,12/3/2007,"to the people out front at all hours, waiting in line for that skinny menu of advertisements and fried food, I look at you and I say, ""Really?"""
J S.,"South Pasadena, CA",12,101,1,3.0,9/21/2007,"What? Huh? I can't even hear myself chew. And whoever was sitting here before us had the lasagna. Half of it is still on the floor. Look people, sure Cheesecake has decent food with a nice presentation. But why are we lining up outside and waiting forever just to be crammed in a noisy room elbow to elbow with the people at the table next to us. Not that I'm complaining. The guy next to me was cute, smelled good and his conversation was intelligent. But my shoe was in cream sauce under the table. Maybe I should have offered it to him with his chicken salad, or just gently moved my fork and taken a bite of his food. Prices. Fine. Okay. Too pricey for what its worth."
Tessa S.,"Phoenix, AZ",5,34,3,2.0,10/12/2007,"the only good thing about this place IS the cheesecake and the drinks! I swear... Don't get me wrong, most of the food is REALLY good... BUT you gotta wait like an hour to be seated!!!! I've been there about 3 times and have had to wait, and wait, and wait... In the end it was worth is cause we stayed for an hours and a half! (chatting it up with the girls!) but my kids could never wait that long just to sit down... BTW, my favorite is the mojito YUMMMY!!!"
P L.,"Irvine, CA",24,47,7,3.0,7/8/2008,It's not this place but it's all of Pasadena HATE IT Parking sucks. LONG LINE. The food is very chain like FAT grease msg heaven but hey it taste good. Then a Tiramisu cheesecake after yum
Kai R.,"Pasadena, CA",0,627,,4.0,8/12/2012,"Who hasn't been to a Cheesecake Factory?  Probably not many.  Known for a giant menu, large portion sizes, and typically a wait for a table during peak periods.  The food and service are generally consistent and good.  This chain is known for their diet-busting food (I believe 1 slice of cheesecake is around 1,800-2,000 kCal).  I gave them an extra star for the recently introduced skinny menu - my wife and I have tried a half dozen dishes from that menu and everything has been really great.  kCal figures are published for each section (I believe none are over 600 kCal).  I have to hand it to management to come out with healthier and lower calorie menu options - ones that taste great (seriously) and you will get full.  The veggie burger and Farro salad are my personal favorites.  Definitely set aside the large menu and pick something from the Skinny menu - you'll be surprised in a good way."
Ann Z.,"Long Beach, CA",2,160,,1.0,7/26/2010,"Not impressed anymore, I think I'm definitely done with this chain, I was there with the family and none of them liked their food. Our table ordered tomato basil pasta, pasta carbonara, the club and some other pasta and it was just blah, pasta was very oily. We ordered cheesecake for desert and it is so overrated and expensive it takes like your basic cheesecake."
Becca D.,"Sierra Madre, CA",1,45,27,4.0,6/11/2008,"The smoothies are really good, but don't try the spicy cashew chicken.  I didn't like it at all.  The strawberry cheesecake is good too.  Pretty clean, usually good service."
Willow ..,"Los Angeles, CA",0,14,23,5.0,2/3/2011,I'm kind of a regular here because the service and food are always great. Highly recommend!
Max M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,73,,2.0,9/5/2010,"Long wait, weak service, weak drinks, good food. Always an inconsistent experience. Been there many times to meet people and there is always an issue. If you are patient, go there. If not, go to another of the many Italian restasurants within walking distance."
Ari K.,"Alhambra, CA",120,255,2,4.0,4/23/2010,"you really cant go wrong here....great chain restaurant, good food, nice decor.....but the wait is unbearable...not very patient here....and no need to wait when there are so many other places that wil seat you right away.  but if you dont mind, its a  nice casual and fun place.....also the noise level here is one or two octives too high for me.....but if you are ok with this too...this might be a place for you."
Jim A.,"Los Angeles, CA",418,127,91,5.0,7/15/2007,"There are so many complaints about this place and I don't understand. This is the perfect type of place to say ""nobody goes there anymore because its too crowded."" Follow the people. They don't go there BECAUSE it's crowded, but if you want fast service and quiet tables, then go elsewhere. You don't go see movies like Transformers and complain that there is no love story (but did  you see that hot lil number in there anyway?) Ok, I digress. You go to Cheesecake factory and know what you're in for. Long wait times, good food, and portions large enough that you can split most any meal and be satisfied. The Chinese Chicken Salad is the best in the business and there is at least four dishes I have ordered that have a bit of the ""Oh My God this is good"" factor in the flavor. The Four Cheese Pasta is one. They are consistently good. Remember, the crowds are there for a reason. For a ""chain"" they really have an excellent menu. Again, its like knowing the type of movie you are going to see. If you know there will be a crowd, and a wait, then there is nothing to complain about. PS try the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta too. And I'm gonna bitch-slap the next person that complains about the wait. Go to McDonalds OH... Big PPS here. I have been to at least 5 Cheesecake Factories across the country for a total of about 25 visits probably, and if I don't have the time to commit, then like most, I go elsewhere that day. Easy as that.  5 stars from me. End of story."
Tom T.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,7,,3.0,9/7/2008,Was packed like a sardine but the french country salad was turkish delight. Fish special was pretty simple. Chirpy service and a strong drink were a plus.
Stacey P.,"Durham, NC",66,60,,1.0,3/23/2010,"Awful, just plain awful.  My friend and I visited this place on Saturday night.  I was anticipating a gloriously calorie-laden meal topped off with sinfully delicious turtle cheesecake.  Unfortunately neither of those things happened.  We were seated rather quickly (10 minutes) on a Saturday night.  That should have been our first clue that something wasn't right.  Surely a place like The Cheesecake Factory, surrounded by clubbers and the like, should have been busy on a Saturday night.  Nevertheless, we were seated and anxiously awaited our menus.  And waited and waited.  After 20 minutes we asked one of the two waiters (serving patrons on either side of our table) to help us with our order.  The waiter told us that he would find out what happened to our waiter.  He returned after a few minutes and told us that our waiter was ""busy"" and that he would help us.  Interesting.  Could it be that he was supposed to be our waiter all along?  It was curious that the tables on the side of us had their own waiter.  Just sayin.  My friend and I decided to our an appetizer and drinks.  After a somewhat satisfactory offering of breaded artichokes, we made the decision to seek out coffee and dessert someplace else."
The Honest Truth P.,"Pasadena, CA",0,26,5,5.0,9/16/2012,"Been coming to this cheesecake factory for many years now. Very consistent service and the quality is always great, as you could expect from any cheesecake factory. Im a huge fan of most of there pastas, especially their chicken farfala. Me and my wife have recently been going sunday mornings because of there brunch menu, ending at 2pm. They have exceptional french toast and are always adding something new to there menu as they are known for. The service is usually very great. Today we went for brunch and we noticed some of the tables around us that were sat after us were receiving there food prior to ours, and you start to get that feeling like... um where in the world is our food and whats taking so long. Well we didn't have to ask anyone anything.. the manager came right up to us and apologized for the length of time the kitchen was taking to make the dish we ordered, and gave us a very exact eta on or meal. Because of there exceptional service and consistent  quality of food, this place is a 5 star restaurant in my book."
Jack Y.,"Arcadia, CA",29,9,,5.0,9/12/2009,"There isn't really anything negative to say about the Cheesecake Factory. True it's a large chain, there is sometimes a long wait, the food is just good but nothing spectacular. But one thing is does very well is that it is always consistent and you never leave disappointed thinking you'll never come back again.It offers fantastic value for the money as the portions are always large and the quality and taste of food is always consistent. I love the big menu that offers something for everyone and the service has never let me down. I've been to Cheesecake many times in different locations and never have had a bad experience. It is the ""safe"" choice when you are out of dining suggestions. The portions are generous enough that you can split between two people and still leave satisfied. My favorite dishes are the Miso Salmon, Chicken Bellagio, and Chicken Madeira. Just had the avocado eggroll appetizer the other day and it was really good. I don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu. 5 stars for consistency, consistency, consistency."
Sol O.,"Toronto, Canada",13,77,,4.0,2/17/2006,"Always packed, this place has some good ambiance and good food. Worth checking out."
Gerald S.,"Chino Hills, CA",90,617,80,2.0,6/7/2007,"What's the big deal with this place anyways?!  A 2 hour wait on EVERY Cheesecake Factory during dinner periods?  It's completey ridiculous!  It is the fine food that they have there?... no... their food is average.  Is it the decor?... eh... not really.  Oh I know what it is..... it's the waitresses that dress up in slutty outfits that show their cleavage.  No wait, that's Hooters.  Oh yeah, this place has nothing to offer besides a waste of your time.  If it wasn't for their cheesecakes, the rating would be a 1 star."
