Drew C.,"Pasadena, CA",110,149,485,3.0,12/8/2015,"A good place to get your grub on if the wait isn't longer than 30 minutes, which is almost never.... I came here with a party of 8, and the wait was atrocious. They quoted us around hour, it ended up being two..... I wasn't feeling adventurous so I just got the Classic Burger with cheddar cheese. It's a typical burger with lettuce, tomato, grilled onion, and sauce served with a side of French fries. Large portioned and juicy, not a bad choice for those not in the mood for pasta or anything else. I also stole a bit of my friends steak Diane with shrimp scampi with angel hair pasta substituted for the mashed potatoes. The steak was juicy and tender and the shrimp scampi was full of flavor, not too salty. For dessert we decided on a chocoate mousse cheesecake. Now normally I'm not a fan of cheesecake at all, but holy crap the chocolate mousse was the perfect way to end the meal. Food is a solid 4 stars, but I have to subtract a star for the absurd wait time. Located in the heart of Old Town Pasadena between the crosshairs of Fair Oaks and Colorado, parking can suck depending on the time of day and day of the week. There are a few parking structures located in the vicinity but they can fill up often."
Jillian A.,"Glendale, CA",62,79,33,3.0,1/8/2017,"Service left a lot to be desired here, especially for the price. I know this is a chain but Cheesecake Factory has a hefty price tag attached to their food. You come here expecting decent service and food you enjoy. I ordered the lunch portion of the shrimp and sausage pasta. It seriously looked like the cook just flopped a ton of pasta on the plate with a glob of sauce on one side and four over cooked shrimp. The sausage was fine though. Our waiter only checked in on us once post meal. I had to put the menus on the bench next to me and dirty silverware which fell on the floor (had to approach another waiter for replacements) next to it. Even when waiting for the check the waiter was just not caring. I had to raise my arm three hands to try to flag him down, which he turned his back to, and then had to get up out of seat which finally caught his attention. For a $60 lunch for two...just very unattractive service. Two thumbs down."
Edward M.,"Burbank, CA",0,14,,1.0,9/13/2017,"not sure what's gone wrong here, but the Factory has typically been one of my most predictable and reliable restaurants IF you're looking for a broad mix of anything that's done pretty well. but this last time was terrible from service to food.  i hope it's only location specific, but i'll hold off visiting any location for a while."
William G.,"Palos Verdes Peninsula, CA",2350,1370,3224,2.0,11/25/2015,"I came here to have lunch with the docs. It was three block away from work, so we just walked over here. This is one of many restaurants in the vicinity. We were seated immediately. We got our drinks, and the delicious dark brown bread. I ordered the filet mignon, with a size of broccoli. My meal was so so. I did not like how the filet mignon tasted. It seemed a bit too salted, and the cut was not right. There is not much to expect from the taste of broccoli, other than the Parmesan cheese I requested on top added a nice taste to it. The service was alright, but they need to prepare their filet mignon better. I asked for rare, but I got more of a medium/well. I never eat steak in any way other than rare. It was over-salted, and lacking in flavor. Come on, people, up your game."
Dorothy M.,"Pasadena, CA",0,6,,1.0,11/27/2017,"Came here at 3pm on a weekday, wasnt too busy so i expected better service... and i was surprised that the food they served us was cold, i ordered mac n cheese & fries for my toddler, fries were cold, ordered coffee...cold and when i asked for a hot cup of cofee i was told its because i have to wait 5 minutes for a fresh cupso if i just ordered a reg cup it would be  a cold cup of cofee??? Even the bread they gave us was cold I can understand if the place was full and busy but it barely had anyone that afternoon. I gave the place 1 star cause i cant give it a lesser rate, sorry this place wasnt like it used to be, not comin back"
Lisa T.,"Pasadena, CA",2,58,19,1.0,7/31/2016,"So, here's the thing. I am starving. I decided to give Cheese Cake Factory another chance. BAD idea!!! Never ever again. I was seated immediately yay!!!! I waited almost 15 minutes to be acknowledged by the wait staff. I decided 15 minutes was long enough. HELLO, they aren't very busy... I will probably head over to IN and Out. Cheaper, better food, and no tipping..."
Genevieve K.,"Lancaster, CA",8,90,126,4.0,3/20/2017,"We went here last night around 7:30pm on a Sunday night. There was a five minute wait and the hostess seated us very quickly. We got the avocado egg rolls to start. Boy, they get better every time I order them! If you like avocado, you will love them too. The green dipping sauce they serve it with is really good too! I got the Cesar salad and my boyfriend got the cheesesteak sandwich. Both entrees were made fresh and the portions were large! We now both have lunch for Monday.  Our waiter was attentive and helpful, just can't remember his name. Cheesecake Factory is always enjoyable and the food is great!"
Andrea M.,"Northeast Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",5,40,60,3.0,3/28/2017,"This is always a safe option when you can't decide on lunch or dinner. I like their skinny menu and order the grilled medallions. Everytime I order, somebody asks me where it was on the menu, so people, it's the very last item on the skinny menu, you know, the one you're probably ignoring for those bigger plates. Trust me, it's worth a try!!!! I would like to add that my waitress was very friendly and accommodating; we were given dirty water glasses (food particles inside) and she quickly came over to exchange them. She was attentive the whole time and I'll probably come back again for lunch. I've been here for dinner and the wait varies from 20-60 minutes. So don't come with too big an appetite if you can't wait."
Martha A.,"Los Angeles, CA",90,40,88,5.0,7/31/2016,"My steak medallions and shrimp were the best ever!!! I've had this same dish countless times and today it was superb!!! My raspberry martini was good, but not as I've had it before.  I always order it ""double shaken"" so I can see the tiny crystals on top but today it was just cold. Still a great time with besties!!"
Bobby L.,"Long Beach, CA",248,5,,1.0,8/26/2017,"I preordered my friends birthday cake three hours ahead of time. When I came to pick it up they said they ran out. What? So they had to give me a smaller cake. Whatever. When I finally got the cake after the delay, they spelled the name on the cake wrong. Swing and a miss."
Kevin R.,"Monrovia, CA",0,6,,5.0,9/6/2017,"The food was ok but this is more of a review on our waitress Nikki Ross. I tend to have the worst luck when I go to restaurants. I can NEVER get a refill, always have terrible service, rude waiters and waitresses but I was blown away at the Cheesecake Factory. I had a date with my girlfriend here last night and Nikki was on it! She never let our cups go below half empty, brought our food out fast, and literally packed our left overs and had the check ready in under a minute. It was really amazing. My girlfriend and I were staring at each other like wow, this woman deserves a big big tip. It was my type of service. I was in and out. Thank you Nikki! Your manager should recognize you for your great service!"
Andrea S.,"Palo Alto, CA",64,32,127,3.0,9/9/2016,"I wish there were half stars so I could give this 3.5 stars. I don't mind going here to eat, but I'm likely not going to pick it if I'm the one picking the restaurant. The portions are really big, so I'm glad they have a section of the menu with smaller plate options and the prices reflect the size change. There are almost too many options, the menu book is a little overwhelming, however this problem would likely be an advantage of going with a group.  They provide complimentary bread and butter that's pretty tasty, but be sure to pace yourself. My favorite part is that they have a display case for their desserts so you can see your options before ordering. If you can't make up your mind on what to order some of the entrees can be halved and combined."
Ophelia L.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,7,,1.0,5/27/2017,COCKROACHES!!!!!! Beware of the roaches at this branch in pasadena. Me n my friend were dining on 5/27/17 at 10pm and she saw a ROACH behind me on the booth. We both jumped up and told the waitress named Channing L. and all she did was apologize instead of informing the manager of this situation. On our way out I spoke to the manager Lawrence and he acted like he wasn't surprised at all!! What kind of joint are they running here?? I'm calling corporate on monday to report this nonsense. Who knows how roach infested they really are?? So disgusted!!!!!!!! Never again. Horrible customer service!! DONT BOTHER!!!!!!
Mary C.,"South Pasadena, CA",84,82,57,4.0,5/15/2017,"Came here 5/14/2017 for my birthday/Mother's Day dinner (joint celebration with me and my mom) Although it was obviously really busy, we got great service, and my mom got a tremendous champagne cocktail, that was better than I've had at fancier restaurants. Even though I had made my birthday cake at home, a banana cake with fudge buttercream, I still got ""Happy Birthday"" sung to me with a mini hot fudge sundae. So cute!!! Better than many other CF locations, in terms of both food prep and presentation, as well as service"
Jose Luis Z.,"Central LA, Los Angeles, CA",37,1,,5.0,7/17/2017,I stopped by earlier at the cheesecake factory and they had the most friendliest staff the host were very very nice and my server was %100 on point I tried the smokehouse burguer and it was the best tastiest flavorful burguer ever i believe this is the best restaurant I can ever imagine with great quality memorable food and drinks i'm definitely coming back!
Yesenia G.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,4,2,3.0,12/21/2016,"My coworker & I had our Christmas lunch here. She ordered the Grilled Chicken Avocado club sandwich & I ordered the lunch special fettuccine alfredo with chicken. Our plates arrived & we were both so excited for our food. So my coworker picks up her sandwich slice & finds a hair in it! (GROSS!!!) she has the slice in her hand, & I look at the other slice & there's ANOTHER hair!! The waiter brings the manager, & the manager is very apologetic. My coworker was very understanding. We know these things happen. It's disgusting! But sometimes inevitable. So Merry Christmas to my coworker! Hahahaha!"
Mae Louise L.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",280,88,34,2.0,12/3/2016,"SUCH BAD SERVICE... Whats up with Cheesecake Factory nowadays? Our bread came towards the end of our meal, our drinks came when we were halfway done with our food. They forgot our cheesecake. We told manager who pretty much just came by and apologized and brought the check. It took us over an ENTIRE HOUR just to eat 1 thing at the bar with one drink each because the service was THAT SLOW. When the manager brought our check, she forgot a pen. We didn't want to wait another hour just to sign our check so we just left.  Very bad experience! Wasn't even busy."
Selena M.,"Pasadena, CA",145,198,1047,3.0,5/29/2016,"Came here for Sunday brunch because there was no wait. Their food is probably not the healthiest since it seems like everything is cooked with a lot of butter. I ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes, and although it was soft and fluffy, it was also very ""heavy"" at the same time. I had a serious case of food coma after eating there. This probably isn't the best place to eat, if you're on a diet."
Mi P.,"Compton, CA",140,47,24,1.0,11/17/2016,"The waiter was great and so was the food. The only issue i had today, was getting seated to my table. The hostess by the name Michelle has horrible service and just a bad attitude. She doesnt even bother saying hello nor hands us the menus politely. Like what? Who are you? Ive never been to a cheesecake factory that has had such horrible service. Will never be coming back here again, because of her ignorance."
Arlen C.,"Santa Monica, CA",8,6,,1.0,3/10/2017,"First of all costumer services is poor from management to staff members, this is unacceptable specially from this place to treat people unfair and rude, I went there and order something to go, and a server with the name Daniella right at the enter, she was very rude and inconsiderate when I asked for extra bread and dressing for my salad, and you got upset when I asked for more. If We are paying for it we should get great service. Eric the manager on duty that day... he gave me very poor service also. Shame cheese cake factory Pasadena ca  I went today to pick up the usual and I asked for extra dressing and the same girl name Daniella, charged me for the extra dressing. And still no smile and a how are you? Nothing. How sad"
