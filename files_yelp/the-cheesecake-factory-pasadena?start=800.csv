Dimitrios V.,"Washington, DC",1,19,,4.0,4/3/2010,"Cheesecake factories i know they are all the same but this one is my favorite. Nice staff, no waiting on weekdays and the food always comes out great. Some others you will get some nasty dishes...."
Grace L.,"Austin, TX",0,107,,5.0,6/10/2007,"I've NEVER had a bad dish at this restaurant.  This is my favorite restaurant and I always request to come here on any given special occasion.  My favorite dishes are the miso salmon and chicken madeira.  My husband recently tried the steak with shitake mushrooms and it was amazing as well!  We usually get the calamari too - for some reason, they make the best calamari we've had! Oh and their wheat bread....  MMmmMMMmmm.... As far as desserts go, their cheesecake is top notch.  My favorite is the tiramisu cheesecake followed by the Godiva.  You won't be disappointed! I can understand why other reviewers would be annoyed with the wait.  There seems to ALWAYS be a wait and they don't accept reservations.  Best strategy is to go and get on their wait list and shop around Old Town and come back."
Thomas T.,"Pasadena, CA",2,62,8,2.0,10/23/2007,"Loud, crowd, and too much air conditioning.  Don't need to worry about blowing on your fish-n-chips to cool them down, the A/C makes sure they're nice and cool in seconds.   The food is fine for American cuisine.  The portions seemed rather large (I'd split a plate).  The service was approaching that of German restaurants (which isn't a compliment); I think I had to only track down our server once."
Billy b.,"Los Angeles, CA",29,57,1,3.0,12/28/2008,"no major complaints on my only visit to this location ..  I had the Sheppard Pie . and im a healthy eater ...as in .. I can eat a huge portion , lol  after reading Soojin K review .. i can honestly say the "" The food is not made with love"" was pretty  spot on ...    my dish was ok but it was missing some ... flavor..then again its ..sheppards pie not a complexly layered fusion dish  . tabasco does have its uses you know . . the service was good we had two waiters .. and they kept seeing if we were ...""ok""  so if i had any complaints it would be because i was constantly getting interrupted  ..  i guess the better terminology would be ...Cock Blockers ..but im trying to stay civilized here .."
Teresa G.,"La Canada Flintridge, CA",28,48,,4.0,1/31/2010,"Tasty.  My whole family had dinner here a few nights ago.  You can't go wrong here.  The atmosphere is quaint yet busy.  Parking was easy and the service was great.  We were in a hurry to get to a movie and I asked the waiter to get us our food quickly.  Our foot came out quickly, we ate, and we left.  I was grateful that they helped us eat and go.  I paid and left a large tip for our efficient server."
Jacqueline A.,"Monrovia, CA",0,5,1,4.0,2/17/2010,"i love the cheesecake factory, but i hate that the wait is so long and the menu has all those stupid advertisements.  it takes me forever to decide what to eat with all those pictures in the way, but I always end up with the same thing either the sliders or chinese chicken salad. oh yeah and i can never even eat my meal because they load me up with that delicious wheat bread. sometimes i dream about it. and i forgot to mention the cheesecake their red velvet one is soooooo goood"

tee s.,"Los Angeles, CA",17,154,76,3.0,3/27/2009,i really like the cheesecake factory but i don't like having to wait for a very looong time sometimes 30-40 mins and others is like an hour..the food is good and the mojitos are bomb! i mainly go for the cheesecake the white chocolate raspberry is sooo good!
lauren b.,"Los Angeles, CA",208,146,2,4.0,10/1/2007,"I haven't been to this or any Cheesecake Factory in a long time.  Imagine my surprise when I bemoaned the fact that I was having a heck of a time finding orgasmic chocolate layer cake, that my hairdresser told me the BEST chocolate cake she's ever had is Linda's Fudge Cake at the Cheesecake Factory.  Dare I believe her?  Cheesecake Factory?  Seriously?  I mean I've tried some of the best bakeries in Los Angeles, and it can't be!  My persnickety palate accepted the challenge, and my cute cake companion and I wandered in with fire in our eyes and lust in our bellies.  We were not to be swayed by Chocolate Raspberry Cheesecake or the Outrageous other cake.  I mean 'outrageous'  is hard to resist, but we held fast.  We had to have Linda's Fudge Cake in all it's glory.  And by glory I mean divine whipped cream. The first bite didn't come soon enough as we plunged our forks into the velvety chocolate bliss.  Oh, be still my heart, amongst other vital body parts - orgasmic for sure.  We left moaning, swept up in the aftermath of having that much pleasure on a plate - much like in ""Harry met Sally"" - no wonder the other patrons looked at us so strangely..."
Hobart L.,"Los Angeles, CA",92,57,,3.0,3/5/2009,long wait always! food is ok at best. cheesecake is good but is pricey for 1 slice.
hank c.,"Cerritos, CA",103,151,,3.0,8/18/2006,too crowded... there's a freakin wait at the take-out section. i mean the cheesecakes are all right there in the counter window... how long does it take to order your cheescake and go?
Mac F.,"Alhambra, CA",0,32,,1.0,9/19/2010,"this review still pains me to think about my meal... it was my daughters birthday and she chose the CCF... we get there its crowded but manage to get seating after waiting awhile... waiter comes up takes the drink order and leaves... the wait is on... after about 15 minutes our drinks are served... waiter takes our food order(3 meals)... note he doesn't write it down he goes by memory... about 20 minutes pass and here comes the food, he sets a very nice bowl of steaming pasta in front me which would have been great if I had ordered pasta, I had ordered a club sandwich on wheat... I tell him of the mistake repeat my order and he says his sorrys... my wife and daughter begin their meals and right as they are about to finish he brings me a club sandwich on white yes white... he sees me with disgust and says oh yeah you wanted wheat... I tell him he needs to write down the orders and he offers the next sandwich he brings will be free... I tell him to forget about it because everyone else is done eating... he offers free dessert which I declined also because I still want to eat something elsewhere... that was my last dining at CCF...  I will not return..."
