Chris C.,"Rowley, MA",0,4,,5.0,8/23/2017,"My daughter had an inexplicable bloody nose tonight. The staff couldn't have been more helpful, providing towels, napkins, ice etc.! PS the regular table service and food was very good as usual."
Alexandra C.,"Boston, MA",559,715,734,4.0,6/2/2017,"Is $45.95 for a 10-inch chain restaurant cheesecake outrageous? Of course. But when your grandmother specifically requests a cheesecake from The Cheesecake Factory, you get her what she wants. As I didn't eat here, I can't comment on the restaurant itself, but the woman at the cheesecake counter was very patient as she explained the different pricing and sizing options. The original cheesecake is the CHEAPEST so, naturally, that's the one I selected. You have the option to add sour cream topping to the cake at no extra charge. As soon as you get to the interesting flavors such as Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake, Ultimate Red Velvet Cake Cheesecake, Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Cheesecake, Oreo Dream Extreme Cheesecake etc. the prices get astronomically high. After I paid, I watched as Maria, the baker, began to spread topping on the cheesecake. She was a pro and so quick! The counter woman then showed me the cake to make sure it looked good, boxed and bagged it, and I was on my way. I was in and out in approximately ten minutes. Minus one star for ridiculously disproportionate pricing, but otherwise great service and a happy grandmother."
Mary P.,"Boston, MA",12,2,,1.0,12/20/2017,"Had lunch with my friend.  Our server was not friendly at all,  asked what kind of bread for a certain sandwich she had no clue.  Anyway we ordered food was not good and not very hot.  We also waited about 40 minutes for food not once after we got our food did she come by and ask if we needed anything or how things we're.  Finally she came to give us our check,  nothing not thanks nothing.. I'm not sure if I will give this place another try.."
Chau L.,"North Reading, MA",15,129,211,4.0,5/17/2017,This location is my favorite one. The waiting time isn't long. The customer service is always good. Quick service and always on top with refilling your drinks. I always got the Louisiana chicken pasta. The fried chicken is seasoned just right and always crunchy. The sauce is absolutely amazing. The portion is always huge! Their chicken Marsala is great too. The sauce isn't too heavy but perfect. Ohh and their fries are delicious too. Always crispy and fried perfectly. I always have to order a side plate of their fries whenever I am here. Only if their prices are a little on the lower side then I would come here every week just for their awesome Louisiana chicken pasta.
PizzaMan D.,"Saugus, MA",0,10,14,2.0,12/17/2017,"Just OK , that's it , nothing fancy , over priced mall food . I'm torn between 2 and 3 stars because our waitress was friendly and very helpful but I can't give 1/2 star . I've heard people rave about this place and now that I've tried it I just don't get it . My fish was over cooked to the point that whatever they fry it in was soaked into the fish and every bite was dripping grease onto my fries , which by the way were very good but I can get good fries at McDonalds . The Margherita pizza my son ordered was a little plain , lacking flavor and toppings . The one good thing was my wife's Bacon Bacon Burger , she's not usually a beef eater but she devoured it mmmmming with every bite so I'm guessing it was really good . And who puts onions in cole slaw , as flavorless as it was the onions did nothing for it , a little salt and pepper would have been a huge improvement . And $8 for a piece of cheesecake , are you kidding me , $8 , what nerve . Total for lunch for 3 without drinks of desert , just over $60 . We won't be going back ."
Michel M.,"Winthrop, MA",2,46,60,4.0,6/22/2017,"I'm please that Cheesecake is getting better for vegans. I'd love to have at least one tofu dish but meanwhile I can enjoy plenty of salads, one soup, one pasta and a couple of other dishes including the Avocado Toast which I just tried and was really delicious."
Tiani F.,"Revere, MA",0,6,1,1.0,8/19/2017,"My family LOVES The Cheesecake Factory, just NOT this location. This is the 2nd time we've given this location a try and we were disappointed both times. Today was definitely the LAST time I'll be back to the location. The waitress was really nice so we tipped her well but the food was horrible. We got the nachos with chicken as an appetizer which is our fave app, they burnt it for the 2nd time. The chicken was literally so hard that we didn't even eat the chicken because we couldn't chew it. My husband loved his Cuban sand which but both ends of it were burnt. My daughter ate NONE of her meal the grilled chicken was burned and hard just like the nacho chicken, mashed potatoes looked like it had more skin then potatoes and the broccoli needed to be steamed longer. I got the lunch sized chicken Caesar salad and I didn't even at half of it. I was better off getting a salad from Nicks Bistro for $10, seriously. The first time we went just my husband and I spend $73 tipped well and the food was gross we complained about the service and food on the survey and thy sent us a $25 gift card to come back and give them another try. Seriously? So that's what we did this evening. We spend over $100 tonight my husband said he should've just put a $100 bill in the toilet and flushed it and saved his gas. If that helps you at all. Oh and by the way ALL the utensils were GROSS."
Kim E.,"Boston, MA",1,12,1,1.0,5/24/2017,Wow thanks for giving everyone else who had a birthday cheesecake but you give my nephew whipped cream? The service is the worst- the waiters/waitresses and even the male bartender we're so busy on a Wednesday night they left my table waiting for bread. After waiting about 20 mins I asked where our starter bread was and the Manager apologized and finally brought it out. I ordered steak medium rare and my mother in law medium and when they brought both steaks out they didn't specify which was which. Go to a different cheesecake or a different restaurant. This location is a JOKE.
Dawn L.,"Revere, MA",30,53,55,5.0,7/9/2017,"Get the fried zucchini and thank me later!!! I absolutely love the small plate menu!! Cuban rolls are to die for!!! Excellent service, very clean restaurant!! I personally love the carrot cake even though I know it's a cheesecake place!! The chicken madera is amazing! Don't know how s chain restaurant can make such perfect mashed potatoes but they do."
Shannon L.,"Lynn, MA",0,6,,3.0,10/20/2017,"Ordered take out.  Just wanted a dinner sized portion of Mac and cheese.  They said the only way they could do this was to order 2 sides of Mac and cheese and put it in one bowl which was fine, about 14.00.  Thats on par with Smokey Bones which has dinner plates of Mac and cheese.  They tell me 15 to 20 minutes for my food.  I get down to the restaurant in that time frame.  Food isn't ready.  I wait maybe another 5 to 8 minutes and they bring the food out.  I pay and rush back to work.  My food was barely room temperature. (I was only walking back to Macy's). The best part of the meal was the brown bread and butter."
Shalaka J.,"San Jose, CA",43,50,13,1.0,4/13/2017,Waited for an hour for our food! Gave up and left. Absolutely did not expect such a poor level of service especially from such a well- known restaurant. The appetiser; lettuce wraps an absolute no brainer took very long to arrive and the entrees never even reached our table. The only thing that came in time was the IcedTea!
Christine M.,"Harrisburg, IL",9,7,5,3.0,10/9/2017,The food was okay. Definitely overpriced. The presentation of the food was overkill. Tasty egg roll sampler and macaroni and cheese.
JM B.,"Andover, NH",142,53,248,4.0,6/10/2017,"Tonight was my first time here. The food was delicious; I had the Mac'n Cheese Burger with sweet potato fries thennnn Red Velvet cheesecake. All of my party ordered burgers and they were tasty. I downgraded the star because 2 of our 8 meals come to the table incorrectly and they were ""out of strawberries"" to make strawberry shortcake. :( it's Saturday night, where are the berries. Our server did a good job overall taking care of our larger party and several other tables."
Meredith A.,"Salem, MA",10,4,,1.0,1/13/2017,"So I am someone who likes to eat at the Cheesecake Factory, but not today!!!  Went around 4:00 hoping to avoid crowds. It was nice a quiet. I ordered my meal and waited a half hour to receive a Luke warm plate.  When I finally could flag down staff (my waiter was MIA throughout) everyone was apologetic and assured me I would get a nice hot meal. So I waited another 20 minutes to receive my same meal back burned and nuked and again only just warm. What the heck and my missing waiter tries to argue with me. I had purposely mixed some rice with the first meal so I could tell if they were going to hand back my same meal and they did.  I just walked out after my waiter chose to agrue me with.  Really bad service, food, and customer service.  Peabody Cheesecake Factory epic fail!!"
Vannak S.,"Long Beach, CA",34,59,46,3.0,8/25/2017,"food always great here...every visit but one was ok....can never forget about a blond hair in my food,  a coupled months  back, but we gave THEm a revisit...if itwasnt for that, it be 4 stars atleast"
Janelle E.,"Saugus, MA",97,147,21,5.0,3/1/2017,"I come here all the time with my family and boyfriend. The food and drinks are always amazing. The staff is always professional, friendly, and attentive. This is also my mom's favorite restaurant, and I can definitely see why!"
D M.,"Salisbury, MA",0,18,,1.0,11/4/2017,Horrible wait and rude staff. Never again.  The wait was 45 minutes and that passed then another ten minutes and then another 15 minutes. This is awful. The food isn't that good that I'll wait and hour and a half. For that I'll go to a grocery store and then go home and cook. Thanks for the bad service but for saving the money.  We'll never be back again!
Brian C.,"Amesbury, MA",66,128,64,3.0,1/7/2017,"5 stars for the Cheesecake 2 stars for the food. The menu is seriously ridiculous here. There must be over 50 items on it ranging from American to Asian, Mexican, Italian, and so on. It definitely needs some slimming down! I've never been overly impressed by anything that I've ordered. The cheesecake however...heaven on a plate! So many delicious cheesecakes to choose from! Skip the food...get a seat at the bar, have some drinks, grab some cheesecake and enjoy!"
Mary K.,"Tallahassee, FL",118,175,152,2.0,6/3/2016,"The food is pretty standard at any Cheesecake Factory, so I can't complain there. I go in knowing what to expect with what I am eating and haven't been disappointed. I was, however, very disappointed with the service. In a couple words: severely lacking. We were seated and waited for our server. And waited. And waited. After about 15 minutes, she finally comes over and gets our drink order and hands us menus. My husband asked for strawberry lemonade. I asked for water. Pretty simple, I think. The table(s) next to us had a group of about 10 people and all ordered cocktails....after we place our water and lemonade order. It's not that I care about what they are drinking. It's the fact that all their cocktails take time to prepare and mix (especially when there are several of them) as opposed to our very quick drink order, one of which is WATER. So how is it that they get their drinks several minutes before we do? I mean it's the same server.   We actually did get to order food before they did, which was surprising given how the server was bending over backwards for them and seemingly ignoring us. While waiting, baskets of bread kept being given to them. We had to ask for ours...more than once. Not surprisingly, their food came out first, getting it in about 10-15 minutes while we waited almost double that. How does a group of at least 10 people get all their food before a table of two when we ordered first? I'll tell you how: they kept reordering cocktail which is $$$$ for the restaurant. And when they are spending that money, I guess the server doesn't care much about the table right next to them that she is also serving.  Extremely disappointing. For a chain, I rather like Cheesecake Factory. But this location seriously needs to work on their service. As for alcoholic drinks, we happily went elsewhere after dinner and enjoyed several where the service was infinitely better."
Nick R.,"Saugus, MA",0,9,,1.0,2/3/2017,"Let me tell you about my FIRST and ONLY visit to the cheese cake factory, or as I now call it, ass cake factory. The wait for 4 people was about 1 hour and 15 minutes, which is okay because it was a Friday night. When we got to our seats, our waitress took our orders and there was no problem. BUT, the problem occurred when the food took more than a hour and a half to get our food, which we never got because the manager said it was delivered to the wrong table. WOW how could a well known restaurant mess up so bad on my first and only visit. Really disappointed in this place, but my party ended up going to Polcari's  in Saugus. If there's anything I want you fellow yelpers to take from this, go to Polcari's first."
Shayna J.,"Groveland, MA",107,33,,3.0,6/23/2017,"Food is absolutely delicious and the menu is great BUT when you order pick-up the girls always keep you on hold for so long. A couple times they hung up on me. While I thought this was a one time thing, my friend told me the exact same thing happened to her. Then I ordered again the other day and I kept getting passed on to different people.. just very strange. So if you want food from here, don't get take out."
Jila S.,"Rochester, NH",0,1,,1.0,4/11/2017,"My daughter's birthday is on Easter this year and she requested to go to the Cheesecake Factory. The closest one is an hour away. I decided to call and make sure they're open on Easter Sunday.  Our conversation follows: Me: Are you open on Easter? Cheesecake Factory: Yep Me: Are you open during your regular hours? Them: Yep Me: Okay, thank you! Them: (silence and click) Hmm...I think we'll find another restaurant to celebrate her birthday."
Mercedes F.,"Peabody, MA",306,213,303,4.0,4/27/2016,Come here all the time. This is one of the best chain restaurants! Food can take a long time sometimes. Banana cream pie is 
Annie A.,"Andover, MA",3,17,2,5.0,5/9/2017,"The spaghetti and meatballs were very good. The spaghetti was to die for! The meatballs were sweet. I always go with my family even though I have to wait a few minutes. (written by Stella H., 7 years old)"
Sandy F.,"Peabody, MA",0,2,,1.0,3/28/2017,"When three people sit to eat, and three separate orders need to be sent back because they are cold, something is wrong. Ok, maybe someone accidentally shut off the heat under the coffee pot!?!?!? But two main courses being COLD is so unacceptable. Putting heated sauce over meatball and spaghetti does not really  heat the pasta and does nothing for the meatball. If a fish taco is sent back because the fish is below room temp, and you nicely remake the fish, might you not consider reheating the beans and rice? This seems to be an ongoing issue and it seems to be just at this location. I don't know if it continues because it's happened too often that a meal is unacceptable, and not just for temperature, so we won't be coming back to this location."
Myan T.,"Revere, MA",368,156,359,4.0,5/17/2015,"Such an extensive menu of meals and drinks. I can never decide what to order. It's beyond pages and pages.  The ambience and decor sets a nice mood, although I'm not one for the extra dim lighting. I get the whole romantic vibe but I would really prefer to not eat my dinner in the dark.  Service is usually a hit or miss. Sometimes they're on point while others including my visit last night was terrible. We waited an extra 30 mins or so for our meals after finishing our app. By the time dinner arrived I no longer wanted it. I would've gotten desert but I was afraid I'd have to wait an eternity for it as well. Plenty of parking. You will most likely struggle during the mall rush though. Prices are on the higher side but the portions are huge."
Jessica S.,"Peabody, MA",5,4,,2.0,7/11/2017,"This location is very lucky that CF has a good reputation... Food is always below standard (we have eaten in locations in multiple states), and service is horrible. We ate there today, and our server couldn't be bothered. My daughter's Bow Tie Alfredo sat in the window so long that it had separated and needed to be sent back to be retossed with sauce. Wasn't offered an iced tea refill, though we had an appetizer, lunch, and cheesecake... Our meal time took almost 2 hours, due to poor service - we continually ask ourselves why we go back..."
Shannon K.,"Palmetto, FL",189,9,,5.0,4/9/2017,"This is my favorite restaurant. Every time I go I have a fantastic experience. Service and food are both always great quality. I like to try some new on the menus every time and have never been disappointed. First of all I always get the fried mac and cheese balls because they are my favorite. As for the main course I have ordered the steak and cheese, spicy crispy chicken sandwich with chipotle sauce (my boyfriends favorite and he gets it every time), orange chicken (amazing), Parmesan crusted chicken (can't go wrong), montecristo sandwich (brunch menu on Sunday and it sure was yummy), bacon cheese burger, and my most recent the chicken Parmesan pizza style (this was amazing). Then the cheesecake oh boy it's top of the line. I highly recommend the lemon raspberry, Adams Peanut butter, red velvet or tuxedo. I absolutely love this place and have always been satisfied with each visit!"
Jack P.,"Woburn, MA",0,60,10,5.0,8/21/2016,"I had one of the best meals of the summer here tonight.  My wife had the hibachi steak and I had the Sheila's Chicken and Avocado salad.  The Long Island ice teas were strong and delicious.   Excellent service, excellent food and dessert.  An all-around perfect night out."
Angelica O.,"Boston, MA",34,35,51,4.0,3/7/2016,I must say this is one of my favorite chain restaurant! The service is always great! So great the wait time can be tough. Had incidents here before pertaining my food and the management handled the situation very well and took care of us. Kudos to great customer service! Granted I'm also in the restaurant biz and understand situations such as these can happen so no biggie. Although they have an extensive menu of meals and cocktails I find myself ordering the same thing every time which is the Chicken Bellagio which I think now may be beat! Our server was pleasant and knowledgeable with the menu. He recommended two pasta dishes for my bf and I. The Louisiana Chicken and the farfalle with chicken and roasted garlic. Both my BF and I weren't to fond of the Louisiana chicken but highly recommend the farfalle chicken. Salads are massive and a must have! We both usually split one for a starter!
N C.,"Corvallis, OR",295,21,15,4.0,2/12/2017,"Wonderful gluten free and veggie options. We had a table of three people with food sensitivities and gluten intolerance. The waiter, Malcom L, was excellent and accommodated our complicated orders easily. I got the Kobe beef burger which was not good, but all of the other food was delicious."
Alexa G.,"Boston, MA",218,36,12,2.0,1/5/2017,"The only reason this review is receiving even two stars is because of that magnificent chocolate cookie dough cheesecake.  When we walked in, it was going to be a 25-30 minute wait-- not bad and we were willing to wait. Luckily I was able to snag two bar stools while my boyfriend headed to the restroom and then out to his truck for something in the lot. I sat there for some time-- possibly 10 minutes and the same male bartender walked by a multitude of times. Now, I work in a restaurant and I'm the editor of a newspaper so I know all about busy. However, he didn't even acknowledge me, as we was serving the male on one side of me and the other male on the opposite side. When my boyfriend came over, I went to the host stand to  cancel our names for the table, which took a mere 60 seconds. As I was heading back, my boyfriend had a napkin and plate in front of him immediately. I got back and he was asked what he wanted to drink immediately. I was never asked, throughout the course of the meal, if I wanted a drink even though my boyfriend was asked multiple times if he wanted a refill. Not sure if the bartender just didn't like serving women or if there was something else wrong because all of the men at the bar were taken care of at great length while I was barely acknowledged.  THE FOOD was okay but pretty boring. My boyfriend had the bang bang chicken, which was good but not spectacular. I had the Large Sautéed Shrimp with Angel Hair. The sauce was boring and didn't have that kick of flavor or even a punch of garlic. Also, it didn't taste like they cooked with wine as advertised. It tasted like it was strictly diced tomatoes warmed up on pasta with a few large shrimp tossed on the outside of the plate. And I'm pretty sure they did not season the water when they cooked the pasta. It was just an all-around flat dish.  I do NOT recommend this location. It looks great on the outside with a large menu (possibly too large?) but you certainly only get your wallet's worth at the take-out cheesecake stand by the door. Otherwise, go no further."
Alicia R.,"Revere, MA",99,1,,1.0,8/15/2017,"I called a little before 7pm to place an order for take out. I was on hold for 15 minutes before placing an order and being promised it would be ready in 20 minutes. When I go in to pick up, there was a line that took 30 minutes to get to the cashier. Once I got to the register and paid I was told it would be another 10 minutes. That was now 30 minutes after I placed the order. It's been 15 minutes since then and I still don't have my food. I ordered take out after working 12 hours and really just wanting to get home, eat and go to bed. If I knew it would take 1.5 hours for a simple take out order I would have gone someplace else else. This is absolutely disgraceful customer service and I will never be back."
Aysa C.,"Lynn, MA",53,2,,1.0,3/12/2017,I went here for lunch today because had been here multiple times An had enjoyed my self you will always wait for a table 20 min wait they was out of macaroni an cheese bites my silver wear was dirty twice my waitress only seemed to be concerned with everything thing else but me when my food got to the table the pasta was raw An dry it tasted like my waitress was so everything but her job an not checking to see if my food was done so it sat under a heat lamp for 30 minutes on top of the the the management only took my food off the bill when I told them I was never coming back there could had care less this place is horrible do not eat there
Gianni P.,"Revere, MA",34,23,,2.0,1/31/2017,"I have to say, that my usual experience with this location is about an 8 out of 10. It's a chain restaurant. Shouldn't expect anything else. This last visit was a 2 to 3. Ordered my son past. With butter only. No garish, just plain. Simple enough.  It's not a dietary restriction, just it's what he enjoys the most.  All our tables dinners come out and his is covered in parsley. His is taken back to be re-done. Our plates sit there getting cold.  Second plate comes out, and now it's in Alfredo Sauce. Back it goes again. All the other food at this point is cold. (20 minutes after presenting the first plates) Not even enjoyable to say the least. Manager offers us a free dessert.  Would have rather had my meal reheated than a free dessert. Manager and wait staff, not even concerned, that we are waiting to eat. Due to the fact that my son doesn't have any food in front of him. Just a lack of communication and common sense. I know it's a chain, but if this is the new standard of what I should expect, there are other choices in the area."
Sharrun N.,"Wakefield, MA",0,33,,5.0,8/31/2016,"We had a great family meal at Cheesecake tonight. I know the portions are very large, so I wouldn't let me son order an appetizer. We loved their warm bread, though. My daughter's full-size salad was massive, as expected. She took half home because she enjoyed it. I got the Skinny Chopped salad. It was just right along with the bread and to save room for dessert. Initially my son was overwhelmed by the number of menu items. He settled on the Mac and Cheese burger. Pretty cool choice. We shared a couple of slices of cheesecake. I preferred the lemon raspberry variety over the chocolate chip. Our services was very good. We dined outside. The view wasn't much, but it was great weather."
Claire M.,"Salem, MA",27,3,2,1.0,5/22/2016,"WHAT HAPPENED!!! Cheesecake, you were so consistently predictable. I enjoyed your food because I knew what to expect and I got it. Food -YUM! Waitstaff-Great!  Now, not so much (saying this with thick disappointment in my voice while slowly shaking my head side to side). Cheesecake Factory, you were my go-to restaurant for everything and anything. Birthdays. Anniversaries. Graduations. Valentine's Day. Mothers's Day. Tuesday... Over the last year I started to notice a greasy sheen developing on, well, every surface. I tolerated it. The food was still exceptionally consistent.  Next point.  When my husband and I started going to Cheesecake years ago we had a waiter named Chris. We always asked for him. Chris was attentive, funny, real. He never forgot my extra sauces on the side. He was just the right amount of chat and personality. If Chris wasn't working, no problem, all the servers were great! Now when we go, we get ""Lauren"" (made up name). Lauren has all the conversational skills of a potato. Lauren has a deadpan voice with monotone inflections. Lauren is one of three or four waitstaff that end up bringing food and such to our table. They might as well all be ""Lauren"". Two more points of consternation: 1) The last two times I went to Cheesescake, while I was leafing through the (now slimy with residue) menu, I came across food smoothed between the pages.  Both times.  2) This last point should be the first point and highlighted at that!  The last two times I/we went to Cheesecake Factory the food was NOT CONSISTANT!!! The first time the Alfredo sauce in the Fettuccine was split and sour. My Shrimp Scampi was delicious, but my daughter was out a meal. My husbands burger was extra well done when he ordered it medium rare.  The last visit was the clincher.  Split sauce (my daughter always orders the Fettuccine Alfredo (picky eater)), Burger over cooked, skimpy sauce on the Mac and Cheese Balls aaaaand my Pasta Carbonara was dry. Dry, dry, dry. Top that off with food in my slimy menu and ""Lauren"" as our waitress and Cheesecake Factory made its debut on my ""Blacklist"".  Side note (I'm not a jerk. I waited tables for years!!!) I/we tip 20% to the penny if the food and/or service stinks.  I will truly miss you, Cheesecake Factory I used to know...  (Head in hand. Tear rolling down cheek. Curtain closes.)"
Josh R.,"Winthrop, MA",118,14,1,5.0,12/1/2016,"The best food I have ever had has been from the cheesecake factory. There mac and cheese balls are the best thing I have ever eaten in my whole life. It is great for a casual meal with friends, or even a date. It is a little pricey, but you pay for what you get. and youre getting th best food and experience that any food establishment has to offer!"
Jasmine W.,"Southbridge, MA",3,97,94,2.0,4/10/2016,"So, I originally gave this place more stars than I should have with all the mistakes my orders have received but I was lenient because I love the food.  Anyways, last night I came here with 3 other people and our server was great. Listened to our orders, got everything right and was very helpful. Him and my amazing fried macaroni and cheese balls earned the two stars! I think his name was Mike if I remember right. Anyways, my sister and I ordered the smokehouse burgers and my wife and sister in law ordered the ribeye steaks for $27. Their plates were small and definitely far from worth the price but at least their steaks were cooked right so they were fine. My sister and I both ordered our burgers well done. We bite into them and they're still bleeding. My sister didn't want to be a pain so she just ate hers but I had to send mine back because the thought of eating bleeding meat made my stomach turn. The server was nice about it and sent it back. Took about 15 min to get a new one and by the time I got it back I was full from picking at my fries so I just got it wrapped to go. I live all the way in Southbridge and Boston traffic was ridiculous so we didn't get home until about 1 am. I was hungry so I decided to heat up my burger. I bite it...looked fine...took a second bite and there was all pink meat in the middle. I was very upset. Not only my toppings weren't packed in the box or even my bbq sauce but my meat was not cooked thoroughly AGAIN. We had a $130 bill plus tip and I can't even get my burger cooked right after the second time.  This is very frustrating since this happens EVERY time I go here. I never eat dinner with my family I get to sit there and watch them and then they feel bad for eating while I'm waiting and it definitely ruins the mood.  Safe to say I won't be returning to this location. I may give the one in Boston another chance since I really do enjoy the food and especially the cheesecake. Sad."
Stephanie L.,"Manchester-by-the-Sea, MA",0,12,,1.0,10/22/2016,"I just got home from a shocking experience at this restaurant and felt I had to get this out there. Wait time: 60 minutes, probably pretty standard for 7:15 on a Saturday, but the host was entirely too rude about it when I said I didn't hear the time. Luckily we ended up snagging a high top in the bar area. Atmosphere: the music was WAY too loud, especially considering the number of people in the restaurant. I couldn't hear my friend sitting right next to me. The server was pushy to get food in, until she ""got us"". Not sure what that means, but yeah we'd like a moment to talk, relax, and take a look at the menu. She ended up being alright though. Drinks: we ordered the Mumm napa split and only got one of the bottles. Food: avocado egg rolls were good, chicken piccata was a problem, the sauce was bland, the chicken was undercooked on one side, and I'm pretty sure they didn't salt the pasta water, veggie burger was very loose and fell apart.  The biggest issue by far though: there were two small children SITTING AT THE BAR! For almost an hour and not one single employee said a word!! The bartender took orders, served them food and drinks, etc! They couldn't have been more than 8 years old! This is a busy restaurant! Dozens of servers, bartenders, hosts, busers. How did no one know that's ILLEGAL? Finally, on the way out I asked for the manager and he said he hadn't noticed. This blew me away. I never thought much of Cheesecake Factory, but this experience takes the cake (pun intended)."
