Jackie B.,"South Hamilton, MA",24,17,,1.0,2/6/2012,"I will NEVER frequent this restaurant again.  They ruined my son's 18th birthday.  I know they don't reserve tables; however, I made a special trip to see if I could persuade them to help me out since my son needed a place to go with 20 friends.  The manager was a very nice guy (I think his name was Mike) and said ABSOLUTELY NOT A PROBLEM.  Well...when my son and his friends arrived 10 minutes early as they requested, they said it would only be a 20 minute wait.  What was supposed to be a 20 minute wait was 2 hours without any seating.  They were finally turned away after waiting over 2 hours.  The manager was rude and nasty even though these boys and girls behaved in a very adult and appropriate manner showing much patience.  I guess there were three business men eating and sitting in the middle of the 4 tables reserved for the kids.  Instead of offering to buy them a drink at the bar, they let them sit for 2 hours after their dinner was over.  This is very poor management.  The nicest restaurants will ask if they can get them another seat because the space is needed.  I speculate that because there were 20 kids, the wait staff just figured there would not be a big enough tip and decided to wear them down until they left.  So...bottom line...my son spent his birthday in the food court.  Just remember...what goes around comes around!  Again, I will NEVER go back there!  Just like every other mediocre chain restaurant, they will keep this up and eventually bite the dust!"
D S.,"Ipswich, MA",7,18,2,1.0,6/1/2009,"just in case you missed it the first time: if you love to be treated like cattle eat here. you'll wait hours in a pushy crowd of starving people, be gruffly seated at a table a full 4 inches from the next table, your server will visit you to take your order and to drop off your bill, and your food will be sub par, poorly cooked, and enough to feed a small village in cambodia. i have no i dea why people like this place, i guess it just goes to prove that some people like to be treated like crap. dont waste your hard earned money on this corporate junk, support a local business who is more interested in providing a truly enjoyable dining experience."
Katie P.,"Peabody, MA",6,13,,4.0,4/27/2009,"I don't mind this place at all, I had lunch here last week, had Farfalle with chicken and roasted garlic. It was GOOD! Piping hot! Yum-O! My companion, Patty, a Co-worker, had chicken salad, which was HUGE and she loved it! We also split Crispy Crab Wontons, and they rocked! Delish! We sat at the bar, and Brett the bartender was great, so were the people sitting to my right, a husband and wife who were celebrating husband's birthday. There was also a hysterically funny kid who was the runner. Lots of personality. I also like how they lay down a napkin for you when you sit at the bar to eat, as the top of the bar is some sort of granite or stone and is slippery. I would have given 5 stars but for the guy next to Patty, he was just a complaining caca head. He complained about everything from the time he sat down. He was mad that they didn't have a huge chopped salad, only a small size. Kinda ruined it for me. He was just not a nice man. I hate when people blame the server for something not being offered. It's probably not offered cuz only YOU would actually order it. I did like the fact that we were out of there in less than an hour tho! Nice when you're working on a lunch break!"
Cheryl S.,"Danvers, MA",0,23,,3.0,10/28/2009,"We've always had good service and the food is tasty, but not of a great quality and full of hidden fat.  We received a gift certificate and decided to use it recently, but would choose many other restaurants in the area over this one."
Christine M.,"East Boston, MA",1,13,,5.0,5/30/2008,For it being my first visit to this restaurant--let alone to any cheesecake factory I was impressed. Got there 6:30pm on a Friday night only had to wait about 10 mins for a table. Cozy seating. Atmosphere was awesome. The servers were friendly and food was even better. Big orders which makes it worth the money. Prices are not bad compared to other restaurants and I love the large menu. We almost went to Bugaboo Creek but really glad we chose this place.
Rebecca B.,"Wenham, MA",0,7,,2.0,8/4/2009,"The atmosphere is not that nice, feels like a chain as it is one, and like a factory, just like it name says. The food is huge portions and really heavy, but there cheesecake is the real reason you would come here, why waste your hard earned money on mediocre, entrees, that just don't seem to do anything for me. Okay I cook alot, so maybe I'm just picky. But if you like huge portions, and a loud atmosphere, then maybe this your place"
