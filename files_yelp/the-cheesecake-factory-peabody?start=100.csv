Deb S.,"Wenham, MA",0,1,2,2.0,5/15/2016,"The food is always fantastic but my daughter just returned from eating with 2 friends and the waitress brought the wrong meal and then it took 25 minutes for her to return with the correct meal, long after her friends had finished their meal.  An apology was given but no offer for a complimentary meal which given the circumstances, I believe would have been appropriate.  It makes you wonder if it were three adults if the outcome would have been different."
Claire L.,"Gloucester, MA",0,34,,2.0,11/4/2016,"I actually went here for a Birthday Dinner for my 18 year old son, his choice.   This was the first time I've eaten at this restaurant and I was not impressed.  I think the best part of the meal was the bread.  I ordered The Chicken Piccata and honestly I've never had this dish in a thick creamy alfredo type sauce.  I should have returned it when it was served but I didn't want to make a fuss since it was a special occasion. The dish was very bland, not a hint of lemon and the capers were sparce.  I actually felt sick halfway through my meal and didn't finish it.  My youngest ordered the steak which was served to her about 15 minutes after everyone else's dish which was really annoying because we had already waited 45 minutes to be seated and another 30-40 for our meals.  We went during a week night, so I'm not sure that the issue was.  I felt it was extremely expensive for what it was which is basically gourmet fast food.   We ordered desert to go since we had a cake waiting at home.  The Chocolate Tower cake was massive however once again, not impressive, the quantity was there but not the quality that you would expect with the high price.  My stomach ached the entire way home.    I won't be returning, I'd rather go to a non-chain restaurant and get the quality I'm paying for."
Jan N.,"Lynnfield, MA",0,35,1,5.0,1/31/2016,"Love this place. Have ordered many different items- never disappointed. Just had the best burger of my life here. Had French country salad, Thai chicken roll ups, and everyone loves the food here/something for everyone. Awesome"
Heiner K.,"Marblehead, MA",0,4,,1.0,8/8/2015,"This is the 2nd time we visited the Factory - once for breakfast and a second time for dinner. I was disappointed both times: the food looked nice but tasted bland. Had I not ordered myself, I could not have told by taste that I was having fish tacos. My family members had the same impression of their food. In addition, it was freezing cold inside due to the AC running at full throttle on a day with pleasant 70 degrees outside. Don't think I will come back a third time."
Dennis G.,"Peabody, MA",2,15,1,5.0,5/27/2015,I met a class act Mgr Kevin he made me feel like a first class customer my wife and I we're very impressed by him the service and the food many thanks Dennis Grocki
Brenda F.,"Amesbury, MA",11,4,,5.0,7/21/2014,"Our server, Courtnie O, was super attentive and personable and didn't hover. The food was better than average. The dessert portion was more than enough for two. The atmosphere was conducive to an enjoyable dinner date.  We were sat right away.  Monday's are a good day/night to stop in. At the end of the dinner the manager, Bobby, came over to hear about our experience.  Being a person with a food allergy, he heard how appreciative I was of Courtnie's attractiveness.  I would highly recommend a visit."
Katie S.,"Danvers, MA",1,37,1,4.0,4/21/2015,"I really like this place! The atmosphere is very nice! It's clean and nicely decorated. A lot of detail and thought was put into designing this restaurant. I understand that this is a chain restaurant and all the others are probably built like it, but that just means that you won't be disappointed no matter which one you go to! My only complaint is that the tables are very close together, therefore, you can hear both conversations that are being had on each side of you while you're eating. The food is very delicious with large portions, and the service is friendly. Oh, and of course, the cheesecake is AMAZING!"
Nicholas M.,"Randolph, MA",7,15,1,2.0,4/11/2015,This location has had a few missteps today. Service was fine but the kitchen has been missing its mark.
Jess H.,"Stowe, VT",4,45,7,5.0,10/17/2013,"Wtf is wrong with me. I've never reviewed my favorite chain resturant. Cheesecake Factory Peabody is my favorite place to visit when I just need something nice and familiar to eat. I go there with friends, family, or alone. It's a clean place with a huge menu. I've got my usuals, and when I choose soemthing new, I'm never disappointed. I love the Thai lettuce wraps and the deep-fried avocado rolls. Damn good. The drinks are great too. I love the whiskey sours and even the blended shakes. But I go for the food more than for drinks. I'm a big fan of the Pasta Da Vinci, Carbonara and chicken dishes. Cheesecakes are lovely too, but even then I can only handle half or less. Thankfully you can box up whatever you can't stuff into your face. The skinnylicious menu is not my fave, but it is nice to have. I do recommend the agave nectar mojito, it's really yummy. The staff are accomodating, funny and easy to get along with, and always offer a recommendation. I love this place, and I know it's a chain, but I always feel right at home there."
Spy g.,"Wakefield, MA",5,45,11,2.0,2/22/2013,"BLACK MYSTERY HAIR I came here with 2 of my friends. I ordered a Chicken Parm. Sandwich.  I asked for NO peppers.  My sandwich came with peppers, which I would have just picked off but there was a BLACK HAIR on the plate.  GROSS!  I sent the sandwich back and the Waiter took it off the bill and said the manager would come by.  He never did and I left hungry and grossed out.  Like shouldn't there be precaution's to avoid this such as HAIR NETS OR WEARING UNDERWEAR TO WORK?   Seriously, I think the manager should have followed up on this health violation."
Sarah B.,"Peabody, MA",36,101,31,3.0,7/20/2013,"Although I have never had anything here I haven't liked, I always end up getting sick later on at night when I'm at home. Still... I like their food. The shepherd's pie is a great choice, as is their fried chicken salad (ask for extra dressing on the side, though, because it is a little dry).  The only complaint I have is that their menu is too big. It takes too long to flip through the pages and figure out what in hell I want whenever I'm here."
Jim G.,"Bothell, WA",188,291,78,3.0,7/8/2013,"Great service, fun wait staff, and good food makes this a nice place. But boy do they jam everyone into small places. Hey, I am 6' 4"" and 200 lbs. You would think they could accommodate me. And they really were herding us to keep us moving. Sorrythis was more of a cattle call than a fine dining experience."
Amanda S.,"Lincoln, MA",0,14,,5.0,6/18/2013,"Love the Cheesecake Factory! I always get two slices after lunch or dinner so that I can take one home with me - my favorite food ever.  Yes, their food is not that healthy, but when I want to eat out there is really nothing else like it and nothing I want more than some of their comfort food and desert... mmmm love it"
Colleen S.,"Charlestown, MA",0,7,,1.0,5/21/2015,"I was SO excited to finally be eating at the Cheesecake Factory! It was our first time and I wanted to love everything. I liked the design of the space and the colors.I expected to love everything but sadly I didn't. First crab and artichoke dip .Didn;t like it. There wasn't a hint of crab. I decided on appetisers instead of a dinner.I ordered their version of crab Rangoon,chicken pot stickers and beer battered onion rings.The crab Rangoon was burnt. I sent it back and it was removed from the bill.The onion rings were literally dripping with grease.I couldn't eat them. I didn't like the flavor of the potstickers or the sauce.This wasn't anything wrong on their part, just I didn't like the flavor at all.I ate two  anyway because I was hungry and mostly because I didn't want to dampen my husband's experience.He liked his potatoes but the breaded chicken patties didn.t taste fresh and were greasy.I ordered a piece of key lime cheese cake to go. It tasted extremely bitter and sour! For that price! bummer!  Sad and disappointing all around."
Dan R.,"Boston, MA",106,73,31,4.0,7/3/2013,"So as someone who has worked in restaurants most of my working life, I actually really appreciate what this chain does. The skinilicious menu has some very tasty options with good portions considering the caloric content. It's great of them to be looking out for health conscious people. I had the spicy Jamaican peppered shrimp with brown rice - excellent, excellent. Perfectly spicy, perfectly cooked rice, and of course a large enough portion to take some home (and I have a very healthy appetite) Also, LOVE their sugar-free cheesecake. One of the only places I know of offering a real and tasty carb-conscious dessert. My biggest issue is that every time I go in, I end up seated at a banquette in the bar area about 6 inches from another occupied table when there is no one else at this 12 seat banquette. I understand it is someone's section, but when it is dead like that, maybe putting a table between my party and the other one would be wise. This is happened three out of four times I've been there in the last couple of months. Very awkward."
Davy S.,"Salem, MA",8,6,,5.0,3/3/2014,"I don't like cheesecake, but I love pasta! The Cheesecake Factory probably has the best pasta I have ever tasted. There were times where it was still hard, but I'm glad they can do it over and keep me satisfied.  I love coming here and won't stop :)"
Zach D.,"Salem, MA",5,3,,5.0,3/2/2015,"Our server Tony who was working the bar area was very pleasant friendly and had many great suggestions! A taller white gentleman who knows more about the food we would like to order than your average waiter. I was very pleased with the service as well as the quality of the food. I've been a chef for many years for more restaurants than I can keep track of. However, their recipe for Shrimp Scampi is simply balls to the walls. My fiancé was overly satisfied as well overly stuffed may I add, thanks to the fettuccini Alfredo. Mind you, compliments from us two very well rounded Italians. Now, let's discuss the pricey bar drinks we ordered... Well you know what, you get what you pay for here. These are not watered down and iced up mixed drinks. Many bars will not serve a Long Island ice tea, or if they do its not made the right way. Order one here! Try not to drive home after 5 of them though. Midori Sour? Excellent! All in all had a great time rang up a $130 bill for two people, and yet I am most certainly happy I chose here. Will be going back soon :)"
Victor A.,"Peabody, MA",0,21,,4.0,4/29/2015,Best part of the Cheesecake Factory is their extensive menu.   Sad they got rid of the Navajo Sandwich.  it was the best item on their menu!!! Recently I ordered the curbside and was seriously disappointed with the meal.  There was NO food!  Cheesecake is known for large portions.  Hope they're not scrimping!
Jamie S.,"Hollywood, FL",105,75,102,4.0,2/24/2013,"I have a 9 month old and the waitress asked if she should bring him banana's and bread- that's a first!   She brought us our food in perfect timing.  Wasn't too pushy about ordering anything specific.  The only thing I wasn't happy about is, she didn't put a lemon in my water and that's how I asked for my water. I would recommend this location!"
Robert G.,"Saugus, MA",9,23,,2.0,2/2/2016,"Over the last year or so this place has really gone down hill. Slow service. loud, bland servers and too much transferring tables from one server to another, portions sizes have also gone way down on just about everything (especially the sandwiches/burgers items) and I agree that the food overall has Not been good... It's just not as fresh and flavorful as one other reviewer wrote. Last few times I've been here food tastes like it's been leftover/sitting in the pick up window for at least 10 - 15 minutes. This Peabody location Used to be one of the best Cheesecake locations to go to - Not anymore. Hopefully they'll get their act together or they're going to be another failure like a lot of these restaurants today that start out great for a while, and then go down like a German airplane. Consistency folks!!!!"
