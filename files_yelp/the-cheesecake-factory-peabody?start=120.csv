Monica L.,"Littleton, CO",227,850,,4.0,6/16/2013,"I tried the chilaquiles on the Sunday brunch menu today -- very good, and the black out cake -- best dessert on the planet if you're a chocolate lover!!"
Linda L.,"Boston, MA",3,54,8,4.0,2/16/2015,"Came in 2 weeks ago with my boyfriend for dinner. Very impressed with the service, pricing, & the portion.  The menu was huge and the even had a low cal menu! I will definitely be coming back..... I also loved the vibe of the restaraunt, it's beautifully decorated with a modern feel."
Ellen H.,"Beverly, MA",402,406,21,4.0,9/30/2012,"Cheesecake Factory is my go-to spot for weekday drinks with the girls. Service is up & down, depending on who is on that night. Usually decent, so we keep coming back. I love that the menu is so big -- and I should note that while I say that, I typically order the same thing time and time again, so I don't even know why a big menu is important. I guess it's like living near the beach: you don't always go, but it's nice to know that it's there. It's my menu security blanket, if you will. Almost everything I've ordered is has been really, really good. Which is impressive coming from (1) a chain (2) a 40-page menu (I mean, how can you get EVERYTHING right?) (3) a more than reasonable price tag. Included in my yummy favs: chicken sliders, factory chopped salad, margherita pizza flatbread, lettuce wraps.  Things to avoid (IMO): Chicken Pot Stickers (too salty), Pear Feta Arugula Flatbread, Crabcakes.  Love the whole Skinnylicious menu, but especially the Skinnylicious mojitos. Yum!"
Megan M.,"Woburn, MA",92,181,62,3.0,6/29/2012,"I try my best to avoid national chains altogether. To me, The Cheesecake Factory is just a fancier, expensive sit down McDonald's that serves alcohol with a minimum 30 minute wait; sometimes 1 hour.  Recently, the chain was sued because they purposely don't list prices for their adult beverages. It's appalling to know that after two drinks, the price you pay is more expensive than your meal.  I don't understand the fascination about this place. Yes, the food is decent in massive portions. But, I've had better for cheaper. And, does this nation truly need massive portions and quantities? Isn't there an epidemic going on? I'm certainly confused. Based on my recent visit, I met with friends who live in the area. To avoid a large tab, I ordered the cheapest listed drink: warm caramel macchiato and an ice water. $5!   (I think that's even cheaper than a slice of cheesecake.) My service was prompt and pleasant. Well trained, I'll give him that. In all honesty, there isn't much that impresses me about this place. It's over priced, waits are usually long, it's always frigid. Not my cup of tea. Why go to the Cheesecake Factory when there are 1000 great restaurants in the area?"
Rosa P.,"Turner, ME",1,9,27,5.0,2/12/2015,BEST SERVICE in MA!  Our food was served on time and the service was the friendliest for a busy place on Mother's Day!!
Nicholas L.,"Peabody, MA",45,35,,3.0,4/3/2016,"My wife and i dined here last night.  We have been to this place a lot and we like it.  It is an old standby and favorite.  We have stopped going for a while because the menu is always the same nothing new.  We went last night because my wife told me there were new menu items.  We went waited the usual hour, and then were seated in the same tight small table with strangers so close to you that I felt like we were family. the waiter came over and quickly took our order.  I got garlic noodles with chicken my wife got a new salad.  The noodles were good i was upset with the chicken i was waiting for chicken breast cut into strips but i got a chicken thigh and leg on the bone in my pasta.  My wife said her salad was good.  My dish was tasty not much garlic, but tasty.  We good cheesecakes that were very good.  Our waiter checked on us once and then took forever to come back, because he had way to many tables.  The name Factory is a good one because that's what it is there a factory in and out next, no real personality.  But to get a good consistent meal and a hearty one and no real changes this is a good old standby place to go."
Jordan D.,"Swampscott, MA",0,10,,4.0,3/10/2015,"Lunch at the CF in Peabody was enjoyable. Though the noise level is annoying and a major negative.. Love the decor. Menu is so large one does not have time to look at it all and truly decide on what you might really like to order if it's your 1st time. ***Wish they would have a special weekly or monthly buffet by reservation only so that diners could try a number of items on their huge menu. ***GOOD IDEA***  :) I ordered from the lunch options and had a delicious, yet small portion of grilled salmon. It was accompanied by a disappointing portion of only 4 mini broccoli florets (tops only for non broccoli fans) and their signature mashed potatoes that someone had added an excessive amount of black pepper to prior to serving. WHOA! If I had the extra time I would have sent the plate back and requested no pepper be added. My server was tired, but quite personable. If you are looking for a relaxing atmosphere, the cheesecake factory is not the right choice. Do take out.  IF you are looking for an eye catching interior, high energy, LOUD, yet decent food and decadent dessert, then you have found your destination. Not inexpensive. Entree and dessert, no beverage plus tip ran $30 for one.  ENJOY!"
Dosia S.,"Manchester, MA",1,21,10,4.0,6/27/2014,"The Cheesecake Factory rarely disappoints; most of my experiences in dining there have been positive. I have been to a few different locations, and the one in Peabody did not stand out to me in any specific way from the rest, which I consider to be a good thing, since it is part of a chain. The design of the restaurant is intricate and warm, and the bathrooms are always glistening with cleanliness, which I highly value in an establishment. The service I received when I went there yesterday was lunch was great; our waitress was extremely friendly, professional, and polite, while also being laid-back enough to feel comfortable around as the youthful diners that my boyfriend and myself are.  I enjoyed going there during the day, not only for the lunch prices (lunch menu is available until 5:00!) but also because of the amount of natural light let into the restaurant. On other occasions, I have been there in the evening and the lamps and chandeliers give off a very dim yellow glow that can make it hard to see at times. It is a bit straining on the eyes, especially when reading the menu, but it is all a part of the unique atmosphere that the Factory creates. Last time, I ordered the Fettucini with Chicken and Sun-Dried Tomatoes and cannot say that I will get it again, although I had ordered it last year and my memory of it was better than what I tasted when I tried it a second time. It is not to say it was unacceptably un-tasty; I was simply not a fan of the sauce this time-I blame it on my ever-changing taste buds! The pasta was cooked well, though the dish itself has both times been a bit too ""dry"" for me; better than swimming in sauce, I suppose. Cheesecake Factory has an amazing menu; it is truly extensive in all areas: appetizers, sandwiches, pasta dishes, meat dishes, desserts, and drinks. (Blueberry mojitos are a favorite choice of mine). They also have a ""skinny menu"" for those of you who prefer or need to eat ""lighter"". I definitely love the freshly grated cheese that is offered before every meal, and their Dynamite Shrimp appetizer is bomb! No pun intended ;)"
Kristen K.,"Peabody, MA",5,14,,3.0,2/1/2013,"Went last night with two friends and three kids under the age of 8.  Decent food for a chain, HUGE portions - I got three meals out of my order of Chicken Piccata.  We also got a burger with sweet potato fries.  And Thai Lettuce Wraps, which is an appetizer, had such a large portion, that it was perfect for dinner size.  The kids got burgers with fries.   Our waitress was nice and attentive.  The cheesecakes we had were delicious - original with strawberry, red velvet, and pina colada, but needed to walk around the mall after eating them.  Lol."
Gregory P.,"Danvers, MA",70,325,55,4.0,3/12/2012,"You'll probably love the food, but you'll hate the wait. I'm talking up to 90 minutes on a Friday or Saturday night (eek!). However, the menu is ridiculously comprehensive, and there is absolutely something for everybody.  Most of the food is outstanding for a chain restaurant of this magnitude. The food prices are ok, if not a little high, but the drink prices are wayyyyy too expensive. Do your wallet a favor and don't drink here.  Our favorite food: the burger sliders, all the salads, and the spicy chicken chipotle pasta Our favorite drink: the white sangria We liked the Cambridge and Boston locations much more than this one, so if you live close to those, go there instead."
Allen T.,"Lynn, MA",29,11,,4.0,7/11/2014,Friends and I eat here when we get the chance. Sometimes the wait is a little long but the food and service is great :) our waitress Chantal was amazing!
AJ C.,"Salem, MA",1,4,,5.0,5/6/2013,This place is delicious!!!  Great selection of entrees. Mac and cheese balls app is good. Red velvet cheesecake was amazing! So is the chocolate chip cookie dough and Oreo cheesecakes.  Service is consistently good.  My boyfriend and I love coming in to try new items and always leave with dessert and plenty of leftovers! We always feel like we are getting our money's worth here.
Jennie P.,"Leominster, MA",0,3,,1.0,8/22/2014,"Came to the Cheesecake Factory for lunch on our way to Gloucester. We had several issues here. One being the staff. Our waitress was so grumpy and made us feel like we were inconveniencing her. Then the food came. My child's spaghetti was fine, with one small meatball. My mother in law got some chicken thing with a side of pasta, it was more salt and pasta than chicken. I ordered their Margarita pizza. The crust was obviously previously frozen the cheese was so over cooked it was gummy. It was gross. Last but not least, the temperature. It was like a meat locker in there. It was so cold and uncomfortable. Couldn't wait to get out. Never again going back."
Joe S.,"Los Angeles, CA",11,38,4,5.0,7/16/2011,"News flash: The Cheesecake Factory is not a fancy restaurant. It amazes me how many people think it is and come to this place decked out in their Sunday's best. It's forgivable, I understand, look at their fancy website, the bigass columns and Egyptian-esque artwork, the way the food is plated, shit the wait staff wears ties for godsakes. But really, anywhere that sells mac n cheese bites, corn dogs and burgers topped with pulled pork can not be considered fancy. In fact, I would barely even consider this place a restaurant. This place is a monument to American excess and gluttony, so leave the ties, fancy skirts and cuff-links at home and bring your stretchiest sweatpants and a hoody to cover the shame you're going to feel when you finish eating here.  It's important to remember when you come here that the the goal isn't to have an enjoyable meal, no sir. The Cheesecake Factory challenges you to stuff as much shit into your mouth as you possibly can and still have room for dessert. This place doesn't make it easy because the portions of everything are stupidly huge. Oh, and there's like 100 appetizers and they all look good so sack up and order a few to go with the free bread they give you (which is delicious). The last time I went here I ordered a burrito and thing was literally the size of my forearm and came with a big side of black beans and sour cream. I couldn't tell you what was in it or even how good it was, I could barely remember by the time I finished the thing. Oh yeah, you bet your ass I finished the thing, The Factory threw down the gauntlet when they put that thing on my table and I had to answer the challenge. I finished my meal off with red velvet cheesecake because it's the cheesecake factory and if you don't get cheesecake at the end of your meal you're an asshole. A slice is about the size of your head and yeah, it's good, really good, for a place called the Cheesecake Factory it damn well better be.  An important side note to remember is that the size of the menu here rivals the goddamn bible. This place seriously has everything ever and the reason why the wait is always so long is because it takes about 2 hours to figure out what the hell you want. It's great if you have a date that is a picky eater and can't figure out where you want to go for dinner. It's also a good test because if she can't find something she likes she's way too high maintenance and you should ditch her ass. Honestly, it's probably for the better because the time you are done with this place you are going to have trouble walking and breathing and probably weren't going to get laid anyway."
Jude S.,"Lynn, MA",5,3,1,5.0,5/11/2014,"Had a great Mother's Day lunch dinner with my mom and dad. Our server Kayla was awesome very attentive to our needs and was right on top of everything. Food was great I had the Kobe burger cooked perfect mom had pasta which she loved. Make sure when you go you treat your servers well, they work hard on special days like today (Mother's Day) thanks again Kayla for making it a good dinner"
Janice B.,"Burlington, MA",1,16,,1.0,8/3/2015,If I could give this place a minus one star I would. Had lunch with my daughter saw a lot of bugs flying around had one fly in my bread when I was eating it could not eat my dinner after that this place was so gross!
Allyson W.,"Haverhill, MA",0,102,4,3.0,5/17/2014,"Pros: We always enjoy the food. My mom gets Renee's lunch special, which includes a chicken salad or turkey sandwich, a side salad, and soup. I got the turkey club. Our waiter Todd was helpful, and the person who delivered our food was funny. My water was refilled frequently. Con: The seating!  It wasn't busy during lunch on a Thursday, but that put us at a tiny table for two. This was forgivable...I think it was just me. However, they then proceeded to surround us with two other parties with about 18 inches between the tables. There was plenty of space to leave at least one table between different groups. It was awkward. I can understand the squishing if it's crowded, but it wasn't. I took off a star because of this. We'll go back, but next time I'll ask for a booth to avoid the overcrowding."
Lisa F.,"Salem, MA",2,32,7,2.0,3/24/2014,"Very disappointed with The eggs Benedict. After our party consumed six drinks made by the impeccable bartender, Brittney, we should of left...eggs hard, hardly any hollandaise sauce, and the manager did nothing other than to offer another dish made when everyone was done eating. Don't think I will ever go back...tired of giving this place second chances for their food. There are plenty of places that make good drinks...work on your kitchen!"
Judy L.,"Medford, MA",4,3,,1.0,12/14/2014,"My boyfriend and I  havent been here in a while since the first bad experience we had a while ago., But we figured we would give it one more shot, We went to dinner at around 700pm and they told us it would be half hour wait, no problem, we waited. Then we were seated and our Waiter asked to take our order for drinks, that was brought to us. but waiting in between for waiter to come back to take our order seemed to be long waiting time, We noticed that the couple that sat next to us had received their second drink by now and had gotten their dinner. Finally the Waiter apologized for the wait said it would be coming out soon, and blamed in on being a Friday night and so busy. My boyfriend and I just looked at each other puzzled, because it was Saturday night. Finally our food came and My boyfriends dish of chicken teriyaki was dry and we was not pleased at all, My dish of orange chicken, wasnt all that great because some of the chicken tasted like it was raw inside and some were not. That used to be my favorite dish of all time, But this night just took that away,Feeling really disappointed about how long we had to wait and then finally getting our dinner which was not good at all. If we ever had to go back there (lol) it would only be for take out of the cheesecakes they have there . Thats all..."
Monica D.,"San Juan, Puerto Rico",75,20,7,5.0,11/7/2013,By far our favorite restaurant in the Northshore Mall area. The food is always great. The service can be slow even when there's not very many people there. If your bread isn't warm be sure to ask for a warm batch.
