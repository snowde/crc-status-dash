Jay O.,"Peabody, MA",3,23,15,5.0,4/28/2012,"Getting into the restaurant can be tough. The mall is very busy and you might have to park a little bit far away. We went on a Saturday afternoon and finding parking was a bit annoying. We (a party of three) had to wait less than 5 minutes to get a table despite the restaurant being packed. I was impressed with the short wait. The greeter guy was a friendly introduction to the restaurant. The decor in the restaurant was nice. It was fancy in my eyes. We found ourselves commenting on the decor every so often.  The waiter was great. We knew he was extremely busy; the restaurant was full. He brought us our drinks right away and was courteous. My sister got crispy chicken sliders. She asked for some extra sauces on the side which she got. I tried one of the sliders and it was great. Crispy, tender, and flavorful chicken. No complaints there.  I had a a barbecue chicken salad. It was phenomenal. The lettuce was crisp; none of it was wilted. It had flavorful, tender grilled chicken and crispy fried onion strings. It was an expensive dish at $15. I should have gotten the lunch sized portion because this salad was huge.  My girlfriend got a lunch sized salad similar to mine. She enjoyed it, also commenting that the veggies tasted fresh. We both ended up with leftovers.  We had a Hersey chocolate cheesecake with chocolate chips. It was rich, sweet, and flavorful.  They basically forced me to give them a 5/5. The staff was friendly attentive. They did all the little things like extra water refills, politeness, and attentiveness. The service was quick even though the place was so busy which I thought was remarkable. The food was exceptional. Maybe it was our lucky day, but this lunch was perfect. Only gripe would be the high prices, but with good staff, food, and ambiance, it is worth it."
Mackenzie P.,"Middleton, MA",0,1,,2.0,6/9/2014,"Usually pretty good when I go but not tonight. Went specifically for the Mac n cheese bites and they were sold out.. not their fault but that sucks. Ordered potato tots, had to wait at least 5min after getting them just to ask for ketchup and one of them was completely brown and burnt. Also got buffalo blasts.. 3 out of the 5 were also brown and burnt, clearly their oil needs to be changed, nasty. but we ate the ones we could and they were good. Our meals came and I got chicken picatta no mushrooms. Found 4 pieces of mushrooms, not a big deal cause I'm not allergic, just annoying. The worst part, my angel hair was tangled all in a big clump stuck together, couldn't even eat it. Over all, I'd say they need to have an expeditor that cares a whole lot more."
Doug G.,"Kodak, TN",10,98,,5.0,6/28/2013,"I normally do not like chain restaurants but I will eat at a Cheesecake factory again. Last night their was a half hour wait for a table, the place was packed and the service and food did not miss a beat.  Recommendations all around here,"
Y S.,"Methuen, MA",1,44,87,3.0,1/16/2014,"Table for 2 on a quite Thursday afternoon & the service was like it was a busy weekend dinner. I don't understand why everything took so long. My son had the chicken Marsala which was a huge plate, but he had no problem knocking it out. I had the grilled chicken avocado club w/ fries, the club was very tasty but so sloppy to eat I needed a napkin for my napkin."
Jon B.,"Beverly, MA",6,24,4,2.0,2/15/2012,The food is great ... it's just getting there that's the problem. We were told the wait was 20 minutes when we arrived. After 30 minutes we started noticing people getting called ahead of us. I finally asked the hostess if we were forgotten and she assured me we were next. We then watched 3 other couples get called up and seated with me standing right there. 45 minutes later we finally get seated because I had to ask again. I would rather a restaurant is honest with me and tells me up front I'm going to be waiting an hour rather than lowballing so I might stay. This happened in my previous visit as well although I wasn't waiting as long. Moral of the story? Go here for great food but prepare to wait a lot longer than you are told. Also be sure to check in regularly to see if they forgot to seat you.
Joey C.,"Manhattan, NY",75,31,1,3.0,11/24/2013,Food was pretty good. On par with other cheesecake factories. Service was good. Our waitress checked up drinks and food on a routinely basis. 3 stars because my patron's on ice were quite lacking in flavor
Mike R.,"Belmont, MA",0,148,,4.0,10/11/2013,"This location does a good job, but somehow I feel like the food is better at the Burlington location. Everything is good and they have a nice space with patio.  Service can sometimes be not so great but it is normally okay.  Their small apps are great and not too expensive."
Diana K.,"North Andover, MA",119,425,1041,4.0,8/3/2013,"Had a great experience tonight at the Cheesecake. We've been to multiple Cheesecake Factory locations but tonight's visit was worth a positive review.  We arrived around 6 pm on a Sat. evening and expected a wait of over an hour but were told 15-20 minutes, which was true.  We were seated within 20 minutes and our lovely waitress came over immediately. During our wait, we had reviewed the menu so knew immediately what we wanted to order.  We started with the Skinny Artichoke appetizer which included two artichoke halves, grilled and served with a mayo/aoli dip (delicious).  I have never had artichokes before served this way and must say it was great!.  I ordered the Skinny Mexican Tortilla Salad and my husband, the Skinny Chinese Chicken Salad.  Our waitress offered and brought bread, which I love!  The restaurant was quite busy so it took a little longer (than other experiences we have had at Cheesecake's) for our meals to arrive but not unreasonable based on the volume.   Our meals were excellent and hit the spot.  The only disappointing fact about this chain are the many entrees that are loaded with calories ...and watching the many diners who probably should be ordering from the ""skinny"" menu chow down on poor choices.   Hate to pass judgment but I wish the menu posted the calorie counts on the face on the menu for those who don't have a clue about making better choices.  The Skinny Menu is a great idea and surprisingly offers many delicious options."
Ken T.,"Middleton, MA",0,6,,1.0,8/20/2014,Not happy went to get my favorite there spaghetti & meat sauce and they took it off the menu...
leah r.,"Middleton, MA",14,35,,2.0,4/5/2011,"I am partial to smaller restaurants which may be why I was not a fan of the cheesecake factory. We went on a Saturday afternoon and there was a wait.  My friend wanted to try it so we did wait the  20 minutes.   When we were sat at our table, I could tell right away that it wasn't cleaned properly from the last patrons.  Still crumbs on our seats... and the side of the table was a little sticky.  After waiting 10 minutes for our waiter/waitress to come over and they never did, we left."
Stacy P.,"Seattle, WA",1,52,7,4.0,1/30/2014,"I am a fan of Cheese cake.  I know they are a chain and I go to several in the Seattle area often where I live.  They are all the same but then you know the level of food and service to expect which is great!  This factory I have been to several times because I come out to the Peabody area often.  It is always busy so that should tell you something.  The food is good and the selection like all factories is one of the largest.   The service was great and always prompt. It is located in the Northshore Mall and a great place to hit for lunch or dinner after a full day of shopping.    I am a big fan of the roasted artichokes and always get them.  I like the upscale eclectic decor too! We had lunch and our waitperson, a young man from New Hampshire had the coolest accent.  He was so much fun and added a lot to the meal.   I love to try different restaurants but when I am busy,  need a nice predictable place, at a good price,  I often choose Cheese Cake.   This one is in my GPS for sure !"
Adam G.,"Saugus, MA",1,11,,1.0,1/24/2015,"I have never had much luck with this location. I returned after not choosing to dine at this establishment for roughly 4 years on 1/19 . My wife and i chose to give it another go after receiving a gift card. I was reminded how bad the menus were after being seated, but eventually decided on an app and entree after searching threw the unappealing menu. We started with nachos that had very little cheese on them. Followed by my wife getting her steak which was fine, and I got chicken carbonara. The first problem was that the carbonara was bland, the second problem was the very small amount of chicken that was there, and the third/worst  problem  it made me sick for several days.  I have just now been able to write this review and would also not recommend this establishment."
Andrew B.,"Boston, MA",4,12,,3.0,7/29/2013,"Food is pretty good! Prices are okay. My two highlights for this restaurant are they breakfast all day, and their menu is huge! The biggest downside is the wait, really"
Courtney N.,"Wakefield, MA",72,1075,22,3.0,1/19/2013,"Holy hordes of people, batman! My friend and I stopped in here to get a couple pieces of cheesecake for my birthday meal dessert, and we almost walked out when we saw the crowd. I had no idea the place was so popular. There were tons of people at the counter to order the cheesecake. A few people swore at us as we tried to make our way to view the various concoctions. They really should put a system in place so it isn't first come, first served. Anyway- we finally got our order in (1 piece dulce de leche and 1 piece of chocolate mousse) and waited. And waited. In fact, we almost contemplated grabbing the next order they shouted that sounded good. It shouldn't take almost fifteen minutes to get two slices of cake. And the price is way too expensive for what you get. The cakes were delicious (that's why I'm giving three stars) but the process to get them is stressful and overpriced. Needless to say, we won't be returning."
Joanna M.,"Haverhill, MA",1,6,,5.0,11/22/2013,The Cheesecake Factory is the best! The Fettuccine Alfredo is the most delicious I have ever tasted. The zucchini stick are amazing as well. The drink are big and they have free refills. Their Sangria is filled with fresh fruit and it is amazing. The BBQ chicken ranch salad is to die for. This is my favorite place to go.
Diego T.,"Peabody, MA",85,10,4,2.0,3/2/2013,"Came here with my girlfriend to grab a quick bite for dinner. The cheesecake factory never ceases to disappoint me. We ordered the Miso Salmon for her and the Moroccan Chicken for myself. After 20 minutes of waiting, a manager came by and apologized for the wait. I began to say that it was okay, and she proceeded to say that the wrong size salmon had been cooked and it'd fallen apart. She went back, and after 20 more minutes we received our food. I was excited to try my Moroccan chicken, yet it was so dry, I felt as if I were sawing a piece of wood. They had obviously left my food at the hot line for the whole twenty minutes it took them to remake my girlfriend's salmon. I sent the food back, and waited about 10 minutes for another plate. I'm giving an extra star because the server was helpful and sweet. Don't waste your time here. Go to a non-chain restaurant."
Hakan K.,"Salem, MA",2,4,1,4.0,9/12/2013,"A very beautiful restaurant. I got the swordfish, it was delicious and we got the turkey burger and it wasnt that great, very bland. The prices are a little high but I knew that before going. Overall it was a very nice experience."
Joseph C.,"Raymond, NH",11,690,138,3.0,7/30/2012,"You get a consistent product with decent food and theur signature cheesecake,  Its OK for a casual lunch or dinner but why settle for the routine when there are so many other options."
Kat C.,"Everett, MA",0,4,,4.0,4/29/2013,"5 stars for TIm!!!!!  My daughter was turning 7 and she picked the Cheesecake Factory for her birthday dinner. He was so amazing!! He made her feel like it was a special night for them to have HER there. Did the whole candle in the dessert and singing. But it was the one on one interaction that was the nice touch. Unfortunatley, you don't see people go above and beyond anymore and I wanted to give credit where it is due. Thanks Tim, you really made her special dinner that much better!  As far as everything else. I immediatley got a bad feeling when we walked in and it was a quiet night and 4 employees were standing at the hostess station and not one of them greeted us. The not so friendly hostess showed us to the table as if we were annoying her... EEK.  Well, then Tim came and what a nice change of pace. Things were looking up. The food was good. Not out of this world good but definatley a step up from your typical chain. But, lets be honest we come here for the dessert. It's in their name. Let's just say it did not dissapoint.  I would definatley come back. Maybe not for a meal but DEF for the cheesecake and maybe a few cocktails."
Jim L.,"Saugus, MA",20,9,,4.0,10/27/2012,"Received excellent service tonight, a Saturday, from Tony our waiter tonight at cheesecake. He was quick to refill an empty glass and checked on us appropriately but not over bearing. Prices are a little high and the size of plates has shrunk somewhat but overall it's a great location and not a stuffy environment so I enjoy it as a treat every now and then."
