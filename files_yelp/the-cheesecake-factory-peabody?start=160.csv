Doug R.,"Hampden, ME",0,24,,3.0,10/24/2010,"2011: I went there with a group of six and we were seated in about 15 minutes on a Thursday evening. Not bad. The atmosphere is kind of Egyptian/Disney-ish, clean, busy but not too loud. Comfortable seating, with adequate privacy. Great food, and an amazing selection.  Our waitress was excellent, friendly, informative and efficient.  And, of course, they have all kinds of cheesecake, which several in our group had, and loved. Update: Our same group went back again this year (2013) and I did not enjoy the food this time. Still a large selection of food, but it was overcooked and several dishes were too sweet (a chicken and a tuna dish), which overpowered the taste of the food, and one raw tuna dish had tuna that was grainy. A lot of carbs: rice, potato etc. filled up the plates. I don't think I will go back again. The cheesecake was still good though."
M C.,"Malden, MA",0,1,,1.0,9/28/2014,Called in an order 3 hours ahead so cake would be thawed when I arrived they said there wasn't an order. Person was very rude saying they were the only one doing takeouts so would they would know. Received a frozen cake so I will have to wait another 3 hours for the cake to be edible. Will not come back to this location for a birthday cake again.
Mallory S.,"Boston, MA",38,391,11,2.0,9/19/2009,"I only end up here when trying to please many people. I'm not a huge fan of restaurants that have over 200 menu items... but I suppose there is something to be said for the convenience.  I'm never impressed with the quality of food, but ya know, to me it's no different than Olive Garden, Friday's, Chili's etc.. nothing special. I've always had good service though."
Liz A.,"Saugus, MA",16,71,21,5.0,9/18/2011,I got take out from here and I was so excited. They did a great job. They gave me the bread and extra sauce that I had asked for. I love the cheesecake factory. I will be back and I hope that my dine in experience was as pleasant as my take out experience. I enjoy the chicken potstickers to start with and the chicken Madera as my meal. Most of the time I am way to full for dessert after.
Kate G.,"Essex, MA",49,327,16,4.0,12/21/2009,"I came here today with my mother after a somewhat stressful morning with the toddler trying to get last minute Christmas stuff done and seeing Santa, the Santa is where it was stressful but this is about The Cheesecake Factory so let's continue... We got there at the beginning of lunch around 11:30 and were pleased to be seated immediately. My mother who had tried on numerous occasions to come to several different Cheesecake Factories was impressed that it wasn't a three hour wait. Apparently she doesn't understand the fine art of having lunch there, well now she does!  With toddler in tow and hungry bellies we looked over the menu and were pleased to find several lunch options which I thought would be much smaller portions but to our happy surprise were HUGE. They also brought out a small plate of sliced bananas and bread for the kid to munch on as well as a small cup of milk. Both of which went over great. As I mentioned we got lunch sized meals. I ordered a Pizza and Salad Lunch meal and could not believe how huge both items were. The pizza was really good and the salad was loaded with all kinds of greens and veggies. I had to take both home! My mother got Baja Chicken Tacos and the meal came with a generous sides of black beans, rice and assorted veggies. It also was 3 tacos large and she couldn't finish it at all.  All in all the meal was perfect. Our waitress, Ashley, was awesome and luckily because the kid is so social she was more than pleased with the laid back atmosphere. This is my favorite Cheesecake Factory and after this experience it seals the deal."
Scott F.,"Peabody, MA",0,17,3,1.0,6/5/2011,"Overall, I rate the ""chain"" at a 3 or a 4... but this PARTICULAR location (Northshore Mall) rates much lower. I base my critique on several visits (it's tough to condemn a place on one or even two bad experiences). Negatives: - Menu: (chain-wide) If I have to fault the Cheesecake chain, I would say that the over-extensive menu dominated by advertisements is a major turnoff... as is the overwhelming number of food choices. Sometimes, less is more. - Cleanliness: A VERY disappointing common thread of our visits was cleanliness. It was almost comical (almost). Over the span of several (up to a dozen?) visits, we would almost ALWAYS have at least one utensil (usually more) with dried food encrusted on it, the glasses usually had food particles stuck on them and/or arrived VERY sticky from sloppy beverage dispensing, two of the times (yes, TWO) we had lipstick stains on the water glass and one time, lipstick stains on the white coffee mug. About 1/2 the time, the tables were BARELY wiped down... sticky residue, crumbs, it just got ridiculous. - Food: MOST of the time, the food was satisfactory or better, but there were a few times where it was just plain unacceptable. As of this writing, it has been over 2-years since we've returned. Things MAY have gotten better. I cannot comment on their current assessment. I may give them another chance soon - just because. What they do very well (obviously) is the Cheesecake. Heck, it's in their name... I'd hope so. When prepared properly... On CLEAN plates and glasses, the food is good. --- Update: FAIL! I tried their curbside takeout and went with something REALLY easy. One of their special cheeseburgers but asked them to hold the ranch dressing, cooked medium, fries, slice of cheesecake. Picked up my food, when I got home, the burger was between rare & med/rare, there was ranch dressing on the burger, and they forgot to put the fries in the container even thou I paid for them. Again, the cheesecake slice was just fine, but the burger (which should have been a no brainer) was a disappointment. How many more chances do I need to give them?"
Stephanie M.,"Medford, MA",27,149,60,2.0,7/21/2009,"Within the past couple of months I've ended up here at least on two separate occasions. I tend to have a habit of waiting until I'm absolutely starving and just diving into the first restaurant I see. A little hazardous I must say.  As a chain, you can pretty much expect the same thing every time you go here. Luckily I haven't had to wait any obscene amount of time, but the waitstaff is never exceptional.  Yesterday I ordered the fettuccine and sun dried tomatoes pasta, which was really quite tasty, but instead of chicken I asked for shrimp. My waiter asked me if I wanted 3 or 4, seeing as how it was a one shrimp difference I didn't quite think it was a big deal saying 4. It wasn't like 5.. or lets say 10.  When I got the bill they had charged me $7 for the 4 shrimp. A little absurd. Had I known that I would have gone with the 3. I suppose he was just trying to make money since I ordered the lunch size dish. The shrimp wasn't even that tasty.  After our waiter man dropped off the check, I sat for a good 10 minutes while he stood at his station staring at me. Maybe he was just swamped at 2:30 on a Monday..."
Crystal M.,"Saugus, MA",0,4,,4.0,6/13/2014,"The Cheesecake Factory at the Northshore Mall is amazing. I always get different meals each time I go there and I just love the atmosphere. My boyfriend and I usually go just for cheesecake because of how pricy it is but I like how its not actually in the mall, its just attached to the mall so you dont hear the loud noise of the mall like you do if youre sitting in the food court. Only thing I dont like is some weekend nights when im craving it, we go there and its an hour- hour and a half wait so I usually go on a week night."
Ethel J.,"Lynnfield, MA",0,8,,4.0,6/12/2014,"Pretty average Cheesecake Factory. The decor and atmosphere is all the same, however, the wait staff and the greeters in the front are a mixed bag. Sometimes they're rude, and other times they're very nice."
Sara S.,"Lynn, MA",1,18,,4.0,11/15/2012,"One of my favorite places to go to for dinner with friends. The wait is a bit of a downer but, the food makes it all worth it. The chicken chipotle pasta is delicious and their sangrias are quite tasty as well. Don't even get me started on their desserts.. there's a reason why its called the cheesecake factory!  I only wish they took reservations!"
George B.,"Charlotte, NC",77,142,6,4.0,12/28/2008,Cheesecake! Mmmmm....Good.....! I really don't understand what all the fuss is about concerning the Cheesecake Factory? I am not a fan of any place where the wait time is more than 15 minutes. It must be my ADD working. So I decided to plan a pre-lunch raid on the local CF at North Shore mall. My first impression is wow this place is really tall from the doors to the walls. The hostess was very bubbly as she sat me down for lunch. The waiter was very professional and did a great job. The CF menu is like the bible only larger. I am not joking. The offerings are all over the place so you can't say you can't find SOMETHING you would like to eat.  I decided to try the lunch portion of Beer Battered Fish and Chips. It came out fairly quickly from the kitchen. The fish was just right in terms of portion and a huge pile of shoestring fries. The coleslaw was just a glob of disappointment after one bite it was swiftly placed aside. I would say my lunch was just ok.  Now no visit to the CF would be complete without grabbing some cheesecake. I mean come on. It is like going to a baseball game and not grabbing a beer and hot dog or getting a massage without a happy ending! The dessert menu was just as stocked with delicious choices. Who knew they could make so many types of cheesecakes. I decided to go with the Turtle Cheesecake to go. This piece of cheesecake was packed to go delicately and weighed a ton. I walked to my car with my left arm hanging slightly down.  The cheesecake was very rich and tasty causing a sudden spike in the  insulin levels in my body. I swore I was going to become a diabetic eating it! Damn it was good!  I can't say that this would become a regular place but if you are out for a sugar fix. The CF would make a nice score.
Jack K.,"Manchester, MA",1,1,,5.0,6/12/2010,"I live in the area and whenever my friends and I want a good meal out or a delicious slice of the best cheesecake I've ever had we always head to The Cheesecake Factory. I've never been let down there - the wait staff is always kind and friendly, the food is delicious, and most of all they are consistent! My favorites are the Shrimp and Bacon Club and the Dulce de Leche cheesecake but the menu is so inclusive it is hard to go wrong."
Ali M.,"Somerville, MA",35,45,20,4.0,8/28/2013,"went for dinner with my parents the other night, food was very good as always. tried the fish tacos and LOVED them! parents both loved their meals (fish sandwich which is new, and a Cuban sandwich). our waiter was Amazing! (Tim). definitely recommend this restaurant for anyone who hasn't been!"
Liz P.,"Shirley, MA",11,253,89,4.0,7/12/2009,"While the service can be hit-or-miss, they don't take reservations, and the wait times are ridiculous, I do enjoy the food.  My favorites are the Miso Salmon and the Grilled Chicken and Avocado Club sandwich.  The menu is overwhelmingly large, and I've only tried a few other dishes, usually defaulting to my faves, which are always guaranteed to be good.  The cheesecake is good, very rich, and if I do opt for a piece (which is rare), I will split it with whoever I'm with.   Whatever you do, avoid the Buffalo Wings.  Unless of course you like insane 10-alarm heat and a numb tongue for the rest of the night!  You've been warned."
MaryJo L.,"Saugus, MA",0,9,,5.0,2/21/2014,"My favorite dish at the cheesecake factory is the Louisiana chicken pasta.  So delicious, I'm tempted to try another dish but once I get to the Cheese Cake Factory I weaken, I can't pass up the Louisiana Chicken Pasta.  The salad's are amazing, and the fried mac and cheese is to die for."
E M.,"Boston, MA",5,33,1,4.0,2/17/2009,"I have to say the first time I went to Cheesecake I was surprised.  All my friends rave to no end how end how awesome it is. First of, Cheesecake is really tall, when you walk in it reminds you of Disney World--almost tacky but thought out ambiance.  We did not make a reservation, being a Friday night I thought it we would have to wait at least a half an hour.  After 15 minutes we were promptly seated and confronted with a menu that rivals the Da Vinci Code.  Granted they did have advertisements plastered on every other page, nevertheless they have a plethora of options to choose from. The best way to describe the staff is somewhat orderly chaos.  Our waiter made no effort to spend a second more than he had to with us.  Also he was rather difficult to flag down when we wanted to change our order. Good food can just about make up for any bad qualities a restaurant can retain.  Not only is the food quite good, you get a lot of it.  The salmon I recall correctly was not farmed and surprisingly for a chain they did not over cook it.   Now we could not go to Cheesecake and not get some cheesecake, I had their 40th anniversary cheesecake--half and half chocolate and vanilla split into 1/4ths.  Not the best cheesecake I have had on the planet, but overall the entire experience is worth it and makes for a nice meal/evening.  If you want fine dining, look elsewhere but if you want a sort of cheesy ambiance and decent food do not miss the Cheesecake Factory."
Joy O.,"Essex County, MA",0,47,,3.0,7/2/2012,"We have been to this restaurant several times for lunch, dinner & brunch. They even have call ahead service called ""Curbside To-Go"" & catering. The menu is loaded w/over 200 selections.  Our servers Christine, Amanda(s), & Sara are always very thoughtful & accommodating--kids want chocolate chips or raspberry sauce for their pancakes-No Problem. One time the general manager even came out to personally accommodate us because Cheesecake knows how much we love to experiment. We love the Eggs Benedict for brunch, as well as all the different pancakes, the Energy Breakfast is a healthy choice w/a side of grilled chicken.  We highly recommend the small plates & appetizers:  Vietnamese Tacos were 3 delicious steamed moist Asian buns with tender roasted pork, crunchy marinated cucumbers & carrot strips, and onion with chiles, cilantro and sesame seeds.  Shrimp & grits were sweet n creamy corn-white cheddar grits (or any cheese you'd like--YUM!!). It's comfort food, but sadly only a very small portion. We opted for no shrimp, but enjoyed the delicious, tangy spicy tasso sauce on the side.  We love the Thai Lettuce Wraps where there's plenty to share & you can choose how you want to fill the lettuce leave wraps with: Satay Chicken Strips, Carrots, Bean Sprouts, yummy Coconut Curry Noodles with three delicious Spicy Thai Sauces: ** Peanut, Sweet Red Chili, and **Tamarind-Cashew.  Also recommended are the Pasta Carbonara & the Four Cheese Pasta. These standard, but comforting pastas are hearty creamy, cheesy pasta dishes. We liked how a scoop of creamy ricotta was set atop w/fresh basil in the latter, & the peas & bacon were the right touch for the carbonara. Even the lunch sizes are big enough to share. If you have room for dessert, try the one of the 50 deliciously creative cheesecakes such as Chocolate Coconut Cream Cheesecake: Coconut Cheesecake Topped with Coconut Cream Custard, all on a Chocolate Macaroon Crust. And the kids loved sharing the Reese's Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake Cheesecake: Chunks of Reese's® Peanut Butter Cups in their Original Cheesecake with Layers of Delicious Fudge Cake and Caramel--pure decadence!! Ask for enough spoons for the table or take a piece home.  You can even order these cakes online to have them shipped anywhere in the US.  The pictures on Yelp do not do the food justice. There's something for everyone here.  What's not to love?!"
Devin S.,"Salem, MA",0,3,,4.0,1/17/2014,Good customer service pricing was decent not amazing but decent. i would've gave it 5 stars but the only issue i had with the place is that im 6ft 4 and they stuck me and my wife on a very small table other than that the place is great
G. J.,"Lynn, MA",4,33,,3.0,1/6/2009,"When they opened a TCF at Northshore Mall my mom and I were overjoyed.  We used to love this restaurant but hated having to go al the way to Burlington.  Now we don't like it as much.  BTW I don't like Cheesecake and that is never my reason to go. The GOOD: -huge selection of dishes (highly recommend the Chinese Chicken Salad) -huge portions of said dishes -generally very friendly staff -beautiful decor and lighting -right next to the mall -nice music The BAD: -no reservations -can be very noisy when there are a lot of people -take-out is unpredictable and sometimes horrible -pricey -sometimes I have to pray and do Hail Marys and hope that they give my family and I a booth seating rather than those rickety chairs and the table  -often notice flies around the kitchen area The UGLY: Seriously, this restaurant is always crowded with people.  I think people secretly live there.  The only time I've ever seen the restaurant dead empty was when the Pats faced the Giants in the Super Bowl.  Total ghosttown, but complete heaven-on-earth for us :)  No wait time, we got to pick our own seating, our food came in no time. Also, the wait time for a table can be ridiculous.  Sometimes we've waited for 2 hours for a table. Even when ordering over the phone for takeout I've waited for 30 min. at times.  I suggest dining in as opposed to take-out."
CeCe M.,"Woburn, MA",0,24,,4.0,1/14/2010,"I was happy with my experience here. I got a meal takeout after being at an appointment at the hospital near by. The staff were pleasant although they didn't really approach me, I had to ask where to place my takeout order. For this reason I took one star away. When you walk into a restaurant and your not familiar with it someone should recognize your confusion and ask if you need help. I got the Chicken Madeira which was delicious. It came with a few Asparagus spears and a ton of mashed potatoes.  The pricing was reasonable and comparable to other restaurants."
