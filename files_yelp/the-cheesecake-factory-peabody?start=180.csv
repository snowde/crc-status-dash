Patrick C.,"Lynn, MA",5,34,5,2.0,11/9/2014,"Dined at Cheesecake Factory with my wife last week for dinner.  Crowded as always but that's expected at the Northshore Mall. Decor is very nice with high ceilings and intimate lighting.  We waited about a half hour, there was probably 30 people waiting as well.  For two people, you will not sit in a booth.  Rather a very small table that you can't even have more than two plates on.  Food is a bit pricey here, cheesecake starts at $6.99/slice.  Service was pretty good.  Our waitress got everything we needed.  Food portions are good, we had leftovers.  I give two stars due to the small table, lack of seating or waiting guests, and you can't have much of a conversation with your significant other because the people next to you are literally 2 feet away.  If I had known it would be that crowded and noisy, I would have just sat in the bar.  Also, sadly this is becoming a teenager hangout.  One couple was getting pretty physical in the lobby."
Lyndsay B.,"Columbus, OH",216,159,25,2.0,11/7/2007,"It's amazing to me that people will eat here when there are other, much, much better restaurants nearby.  The cheesecake is good. That's about it."
Chris P.,"Peabody, MA",0,4,,4.0,8/22/2011,"I've been to several Cheesecake Factories. The one in Peabody is very good overall. The menu is huge !! The decor is great. My 2 yr old loves the appearance & the constant traffic of the waitstaff. This is his favorite restaurant by far. My 14 yr old loves the Orange Chicken. My fav's are the Miso Salmon, The Tuna Carpaccio, The Avocado Spring Rolls & the Black out Cake. As for Cheesecakes, they are creamy, fresh & always tasty. Last time, I had one with a blondie crust, macadamia, nuts, caramel, white chocolate, etc... It was unbelievable, maybe the best & sweetest piece of cheesecake I've ever had. ** Diabetics should avoid this place **  The only negative in the 10+ times I've visited is the take-out process could be better"
ME G.,"Swampscott, MA",0,135,7,2.0,2/15/2013,"if you are a fan of the big bang theory, you need to go to see where Penny works.  they specialize in over 200 items, which is far more than most restaurants can do well. if you get bored you can read the advertisements in their menu, which helps keep them afloat, I guess.    I also found that their food helps me lose weight because it does not sit in my body very long.   The cheesecake was good though."
Manda C.,"Peabody, MA",0,5,1,5.0,8/5/2011,"Went here with my family a week ago, the food was great came out hot and plated neatly, our waitress made sure we had our drinks refilled and checked on us throughout dinner. I had the new pina colada cheesecake it was super yummy, only negitive i wish the slice was bigger."
Matt B.,"Hallowell, ME",47,33,,4.0,11/1/2010,"After spending the weekend mingling with spirits, witches, and other supernatural creatures (Ah, the joys of Halloween weekend in Salem!), Kelley (my girlfriend) and I decided we would finally check out the Cheesecake Factory we had driven by so many times on our way on and off I-95! First off, let me say that I kind of dislike chain restaurants. I don't hate them, exactly. I'll eat at them from time to time and usually I'm satisfied enough with the experience. Most of them are simply unremarkable. The service is always standard. The food is decent. I can go to one and pretty much know what to expect. Some I really do dislike, though. Either their atmosphere is bad or their food is disappointing or something is just not right. Entering The Cheesecake Factory was like entering a nightmare for me. The doors are huge and heavy. The restaurant itself is gigantic, far bigger than any restaurant I've ever eaten in before. I felt like there were tables for miles around! The ceilings tower above everyone like in an airport, train station, or factory of some sort! I saw staff standing around but no one greeted us when we entered. After a few bewildering and discouraging moments, I finally noticed the desk that was sort of in the middle of the lobby and asked the attendant standing there if we were supposed to check in with him. My guess turned out to be correct, he took my name, and we found a spot to wait for a table. They really need to have that desk marked somehow or have staff waiting at the door to greet people. We were entirely ignored until we figured out how to check in. We waited less than ten minutes, I think, for a table. The hostess who led us to the table seemed lifeless, possibly annoyed that she actually had to work. Our waiter, though, turned out to be a friendly guy who seemed eager to please.  The menu, frankly, is intimidating at twenty-one pages long! It goes against everything I've read about good restaurant management, where the right choice is usually to keep it short. Do a few things well, no more than three or four pages of great menu items that taste great, and people will come back over and over again. Twenty-pages, with what I'm told is over two hundred items, seems insane. I don't know how they pull it off! They may have kidnapped Willy Wonka's Oompa Loompas and put them to work in Cheesecake Factory kitchens. We both ordered peach smoothies to drink. They arrived in completely full, very large glasses and tasted absolutely delicious! I ordered the seared tuna tataki salad. Kelley ordered the crispy chicken costoletta. I've never had rare tuna before but I was feeling a little adventurous! The food didn't take long to arrive, despite the place being quite busy and very large. My meal came presented very nicely, with several slices of lovely tuna (seared brown on the outside, nice and pink on the inside), four majestic slices of beef steak tomato, a bit of avocado, and a large pile of greens. The tuna tasted fantastic and felt great in my mouth. The seasoning was a little ""hot"" for my tastes but that's just personal preference. (I'm still working up my resistance to hot, spicy foods!) The greens, avocado, and tomato were fresh and delicious. I toned the spicy sensations from the tuna down by quickly following tuna slices with other things from my plate or eating tuna with other things at the same time. It worked well and tasted wonderful! I also tried Kelley chicken costoletta and found it excellent. The chicken was perfectly tender and tasted fantastic! Between my huge peach smoothie and my tuna tataki salad, I was stuffed to the gills when it was time for dessert. I couldn't turn down the chance to try the famous Cheesecake Factory cheesecake, though. So I got a piece of the seasonal Pumpkin Pecan Cheesecake to go. I just ate it, siting here at home in Maine, and found it delicious. It's just what I expect cheesecake to be. I am pretty sure I've never had cheesecake with pecans, though, and now I'm looking forward to holiday pies, hoping pecan will be among them. The Cheesecake Factory is one of those chain restaurants I really should hate. The atmosphere definitely doesn't do it for me. It really is too big and too impersonal. The service, at least at first, was really quite poor. However, the food really ""did it"" for me. I just looked at their menu on their website and noticed several items listed that I didn't notice when looking at the menu in the restaurant. There are so many things I'd love to try! If all the food is as good as we got, it's definitely going to be worth going back from time to time. Cheesecake Factory, you aren't perfect, but you've won me over! A final note, other than the incredibly heavy doors one must manage in order to enter the restaurant, the place is pretty handicapped accessible. No steps or steep inclines, generally enough room to comfortably navigate the dining room floor, and the bathrooms easily accommodate a wheelchair."
Dan M.,"Boston, MA",21,125,,3.0,10/24/2007,"Ok, I know this is a new location for the Cheesecake and I wen there on their third day of opening.  But COME ON, it was 3pm on a Friday.  Hardly anyone is there and the host staff still manages to take half hour to seat us.  We walk up and request a table for two, fine.  The host starts looking at her stupid screen and hands over a piece of paper with our table number on it to some other host.  The first host says, ""she'll be right with you.""  So we wait, and wait, and wait.   Finally, I'm like ""what's going on, parties of 4 that just walked in are being sat before us.""  She looks confused and says, ""OH, sorry Hold on"" and comes back and tells us our host is dealing with a difficult customer.  This should have been a sign to leave now.   The original host that was supposed to seat us keeps looking over at us and rolling her eyes, ""uhhh seriously?""  Are you jealous of the girl I was with?  Why do girls act like this?   FInally some guy seats us.  While our waitress was friendly, my lunch portion salad must have had a bottle of dressing on it.  It was basically soup with lettuce in it.  Gross.  I couldn't finish it.  3 stars because I *think* they'll get better with practice."
Glenn E.,"South Yarmouth, MA",2,87,4,1.0,4/27/2014,Not prepared for  brunch group.  One guest of twelve got their eggs 15 minutes after everyone else. One dish of eggs was cold.  The server failed to return to see if everyone was satisfied with their meals which we were not.  No one ever got coffee refills after the dishes were served.  I had to ask the server to bring over the manager.  The manager asked what he could do to make it up.  At that point the meals and our happy time was ruined so there was nothing.  I told him I found the deplorable service to be outrageous.  He replied that he thought I was outrageous.  What a shame that the manager is incapable of resolving customer satisfaction issues at a national chain which normally is synonymous with quality.  I travel for work and eat out 4-5 days/week.  I was sooo surprised the manager didn't offer anything and put the onus on me - I was expecting him to take the initiative and comp us the 2 defective meals and take a % off everyone's for the incredible poor service.  I would keep this incident in mind for Mother's Day.
william c.,"Braintree, MA",0,11,,5.0,3/9/2011,"The Cheesecake Factory, North Shore Mall, Peabody. Very busy all the time. You have to wait to be seated. The food is delicious and the menu is extensive. Food is of generous portions. I have yet to have had enough room for the CHEESECAKE.  Get CHEESECAKE to take home.  BEST IDEA."
Cici C.,"Danvers, MA",2,16,,5.0,6/25/2011,Food here is always amazing. Never had a problem with customer service or food. Though on special occasions there are wait times. But they are very good about getting you seated in the time frame they give you. I tried their breakfast once. I got their pancakes with a side of eggs. The eggs were yummy and the pancakes were quite big but just ok. Overall I still will be eating here.
Aimee G.,"Salem, MA",22,133,,3.0,1/7/2008,"Only 3 stars here, because 5 of my friends and I waited 2 hours for a table Saturday night.  I do not understand why, when this place has been open for months now, there is still a 2 hour wait!!! I have always liked the food here.  I have been to the Burlington and Prudential locations several times. They have a huge menu selection, and taking the cheesecake ""to go"" after dinner is the best part. The one down side was that because we were seated at 9 p.m.,  they were out of a lot of flavors of cheesecake.  You'll pay a bit more than your average restaurant, but the portion sizes are huge and make it worth every penny. Be warned that if you order a ""small garden salad"" you could pretty much eat it as a regular meal. I took like 2 bites and had to call it quits so I wouldn't be too full for dinner.  On the up side, its at the mall, so I DID find ways to entertain myself while waiting for the buzzer to go off."
Emme D.,"Quincy, MA",0,36,1,5.0,12/19/2011,"This is one of my favorite Cheesecake Factories ever... the service, with the exception of 2 times, has been excellent (I visit about twice a month for the last year).  They hire great waiters who are attentive (the best being Debbie and Celeste) and take their jobs seriously.  Only twice did I have 2 different people who had absolutely dreadful, slow service (others brought out drinks, food as she just stood there and said, ""O yeah, your water!"" and another tried, too hard, to upsell dessert.  No means no...)  I really enjoy the fish entrees here because the fish is fresh, served in large servings and everything tastes great."
J P.,"Norwell, MA",1,155,,3.0,6/3/2012,"We have been to this location 4 times now, yesterday on a Saturday night was the worst experience. We orderd curbside take out, was promised the food in 20 min. So we waited in the designated spot but we soon realized that there were no food being delivered to anyone while we were waiting there. So I walked into the restaurants, it was like mayhem. So many lines of people. Food sitting on the counter ready to to delivered. It's somply mis-managed. Food was average for the price."
Lindsay G.,"Boston, MA",0,32,,3.0,10/25/2009,"The food is good, the cocktails are ok.....the food is generous portions, the cocktails are weak and not worth the pricetag. I have yet to have enough room for the cheesecake. However, a doggy bag with a piece of cheesecake for later, is a good idea."
Lisa C.,"Boston, MA",40,305,,4.0,8/6/2009,"This place is always packed and I'm not sure if it's about the service or the location.  At any rate, our 10 minute wait was more like 20.  We ended up with a fantastic server who didn't make a big deal of my fiance switching out his entree since the marsala sauce had a funky taste.  The rest of our food was awesome and the dulce de leche cheesecake is to die for!"
Sarenn N.,"Malden, MA",27,11,,3.0,5/1/2011,"Its hard to give them 4stars.I like the place.its really nice and have great foods.they are a bit pricey but well portioned.and that's all the good stuff I have to say. So recently I went there with my gf for dinner... here comes the bad part, it was busy on a saturday night go figure, so call ahead n check the wait.the front desk are   not really good with eating in front of strangers I just find it weird that I can hear there business since im sitting right next to them.but this place is so cramped up if your sitting @one of those long tables where u are literally side by side with another group of people.the waiters over there are too occupied n rude to help u with anything I had to run down a staff just to get a   is how they serve us ""hey what do u want?""I was like excuse me? I was really thrown off because it was really rude. the table we were sitting was small it couldn't even fit our 2dish n drinks.but I would go to a different spot since I do like this restaurant."
JasparLamar C.,"Boston, MA",1,64,5,2.0,6/29/2009,"The food is only so-so & the service is extremely inconsistent.  Sometimes you get a terrific server, other times it appears as though the staff is unsure who is covering what tables.  MAJOR PROBLEM:  What's with serving the meals at different times...some at our table got their dinner, while others got their's about five-ten minutes later...this has occured twice!    Has that become a norm?   I think not."
Nina N.,"Medford, MA",36,110,2014,4.0,7/31/2008,"I've ate here or at this food chain several times now. I still think the food is good, maybe even great. The portion is more than generous. I've seen the monster salads, but I have never ordered them since I fear eating salad in a public place when I am such a tiny person and fear that spectators would think that I am on a strict diet or have some sort of eating disorder. lol. But wouldn't it be strange to be on a diet and have such a monstrous salad, one in which you can't even see the eyes of the person sitting accross from you? Lol. I am over exaggerating.  Let's see, the first time I went here I went in a large group with my boyfirend and his co-workers. I ordered a virgin pina coloda. I didn't feel like showing my id. I swear, it sucks sometimes to look like you are under 21. For my main entree, I had the bistro shrimp pasta. I like to try shrimp dishes first, then beef, then chicken when I try new places. I prefer seafood over poultry. I liked my dish. I didn't absolutely love it, but I was having a good time and I enjoyed the busy restaurant atmosphere and wanted to come back. I tried my boyfirend's hibachi steak dish and it was not so good though. I agreed with him that it was a bit chewy and a terribly small portion. The mushroom tasted...gritty, like it wasn't cleaned properly. The wasabi mash potatoes was plentiful but it was also very dry. What is the point of serving a lot of unedible mashpotatoe? I'd rather be served a small portion that was excellent and be left wanting more.  As for service, service was not so good. The cook messed up one of my bf's co-workers order. The waiters were not sympathetic. They came out of the kitchen with a plate with dry chicken pieces on it and ask us to toss it in with the bow tie pasta. Tisk, tisk. And a very long wait for a table. The second time I went here I went with my boyfriend and his best friend and his girlfriend. I had and liked a lot the spicy chicken chipotle pasta. It was very tasty. I love the asparagus in it, it was like a treat. Sorry, I love my vegetables.  Let's see, I love their deserts. Who doesn't? Cheesecake. Yum. Fresh strawberry. Yum. Actually, the second time I went to the Cheesecake Factory, I went to the one in Burlington. The wait was longer but our waitress was nice and the food seemed to taste better. Maybe I got lucky this time and ordered the right stuff. I have tried the canjun Jambalaya pasta twice. It is absolutely spicy goodness. The first time I didn't like it because my chicken was overcooked and dry, but the second time when I had it in Braintree, MA adjacent to the South Shore Mall, it was supberb. The chicken was super juicy. If you love spicy, this dish is the one. I highly recommend this. I rate this over the spicy chicken chipotle pasta."
Vincent R.,"Pepperell, MA",27,41,13,3.0,2/17/2009,"A bit too crowded for a relaxing lunch, but the service was good and the food was quite yummy.  No complaints but not overly outstanding."
Susan C.,"Seabrook, NH",0,3,,3.0,7/30/2013,"Last week when we went our waitress was awful but the food was good.  Today we sat at a table and I noticed that even though it had been set it was filthy- wet spots from drinks and crumbs everywhere.  We asked the waiter to clean the table and reset it since some of the silverware was less than clean. He did but left the dirty rag on the table next to us.  He then took our order for drinks and appetizers and we asked for bread.  10 min later our drinks and appetizers arrived and we asked for bread again.  When he came to take our plates away later my teenage daughter said, ""we would still really like some bread"". He said, ""oh"" and a few minutes later tossed it on the table. The food arrived and although I had told our waiter that we were splitting the meal no extra dish was brought over. The kitchen is doing a good job the food tastes good but their lunch wait staff is not doing a good job.  Talking with the bartender rather than being attentive to their tables means that they need to be retrained. I would rather go someplace that appreciates my business and that means I won't be eating there again."
