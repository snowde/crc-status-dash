Ariana C.,"Peabody, MA",0,18,2,3.0,2/10/2017,"It was fine, service was OK, however I was really craving and in need of a cappuccino, not a latte...  And I got it also to go. What I really got was 12 ounces of milk and a shot of expresso. If you plan on making cappuccinos and lattes you should know the difference. Also asked for cinnamon and the woman never heard of it apparently ? Also advice, maybe offer soy or almond milk."
Paul N.,"Jacksonville, FL",7,3,1,2.0,12/23/2016,Food was good. Service was horrible. Order nachos and a beer. Nachos beat the beer out which should absolutely never happen. Was checked on once in an hour and then it took 15 minutes to run my card to checkout. Server went and took orders of food and drink from 2 other tables. Nothing like what this place should be run like for the prices and atmosphere.
Lorraine T.,"Stoneham, MA",0,3,,2.0,5/2/2017,"Normally, I love this place, so at my boyfriend's request I took him there on April 12, 2017 to celebrate his special day.  My food came 10 minutes before his and without a very important side dish, making me not want to eat it until it arrived.  When the waiter delivered the main dish, I asked for extra applesauce (the side dish I was missing).  15 minutes later he delivered a very tiny bowl filled with little apples, not applesauce.  It was obviously nuked as it was so hot I had to wait to eat it.  I told him that I was supposed to have applesauce.  The manager then came over and gave me some lame excuse that the reason it didn't come out in time was because it took them a while ""to heat it.""  I told the manager that I didn't enjoy my meal because it was not delivered as promised.  He just said...""oh sorry,"" and that was it...no comps for dessert...NOTHING.  Terrible manager."
Jaime P.,"Gloucester, MA",1,24,,5.0,1/18/2017,Went here for drinks tonight. Had strawberry daiquiris! Planned on getting cheesecake also but the drinks turned out to be enough.Our server jesse was wonderful! So nice and always asking if we needed anything! Such a great experience!
Frank S.,"Milan, NH",0,49,2,4.0,3/4/2017,"What can I say about TCF. The food comes in huge portions and the menu rarely changes. We were the first people through the door today. The wait staff were walking around in a daze. It took several minutes for staff to come to the front to seat us. I ordered an ice tea and my son ordered a beer. It took at least 10 minutes to receive the drinks. We ordered a appetizer, Cuban sandwich and fish taco. The dishes were very tasty with plenty to take home including slices of Key Lime Cheesecakes which are to die for. Our lunch came to $75 and change plus tip. TCF hasn't changed."
cheri t.,"Haverhill, MA",6,225,,3.0,1/17/2017,"Had lunch here today and was not impressed at all with our entrees.  The avocado egg roll app  was excellent, so tasty.  The two pasts dishes were a huge disappointment.  First, we ordered off the dinner portion and the quantity was rather small. I got the garlic noodles with shrimp and it was flavorless and real cheap on the mushrooms and other items. For 19.99 I expected so much more."
Mr H.,"Boston, MA",0,30,12,4.0,9/18/2016,"Steak tacos, highly recommend, the guacamole is very good, plenty of flavor which is what I have found missing at Mexican restaurants, we keep getting the same waiter who is very good at his job."
Bill D.,"Saugus, MA",3,74,30,3.0,8/28/2016,"The food here is average and the service is also average. The menu is very large and offers something for everyone. If your looking for a quiet place to have lunch or dinner, this is not the place. The prices are a bit high and a bottle of Bud Light was 5.75, an outrageous price to charge. Overall, this place is 3 stars."
Tien D.,"Lynn, MA",0,16,12,2.0,4/22/2017,"Place is always packed because of the clientele being on the younger side and traffic from the malls. Waiters are horrible. Drinks are good. I got served over cooked steak and then asked for it to be changed to the pork chop that came out raw. The food is always overcooked or under, stay safe with burgers, pastas, and salads. Otherwise, eat at your own risk. The drinks are good but way over priced compared to what you can get at surrounding restaurants with better service and quality."
Brian S.,"Lynn, MA",69,22,,2.0,4/2/2017,"For an 8pm crowd, the restaurant was busy and very loud. The food and drinks were grossly overpriced for the quality. While the waitstaff around us seemed friendly and engaging, our waiter was about as interesting as dry Bisquick. He was slow, never smiled, and barely asked us how our food or experience was. We got more attention out of a waitress from another station who offered to come over and clear our dinner plates."
Mel R.,"Tampa, FL",1154,378,1066,4.0,8/7/2014,"Hard to find a negative thing to say about the cheesecake, it's always been on my list favorite restaurants. Love their consistency when it comes to the service and quality of food.  This particular one in Peabody was no exception. Well located, usual great ambiance that you  expect from a CF. Only complaint during this evening was that they had no wasabi ahi tuna, (maybe the best item on the menu) no big deal really, except for the fact that I was not made aware till about 15-20 minutes after placing my order, stomach was growling... when the manager came over to apologize I asked if he would throw in a free drink and he responded with a NO with a somewhat sarcastic laugh. He said he couldn't do that... you are a manager, you made a mistake, don't tell me u can't throw in a drink, of course u can!!  Anyhow, four stars it is, not a flawless experience but a very good experience nonetheless. Food was fantastic."
W. A.,"Boston, MA",0,38,,4.0,7/8/2015,"Always a great place to go when you can't decide where to head for lunch or dinner.  As you must know, the menu is extensive and I'm pretty sure there's even a table of contents.  Cheesecake is expensive per slice but is a novelty.  Two people could easily split one.  I gave this review four stars since it can be noisy, wait is long, and all the tables are on top of each other.   You have to be smart when ordering if you don't want to spend a lot since some of the choices are pricey or overpriced.  For instance, some pasta dishes are pricey where you have to think----pasta is $1 a box in the store.  LOL. Portions are large however. There was an issue once at our table with food being incorrect, but the manager came over and was super nice and took it off the bill.    Never a bad experience."
Alyssa G.,"Danvers, MA",117,39,3,2.0,5/6/2016,"I honestly can say that I don't go here as often because the restaurant just isn't what it used to be. 1- the food hasn't been as good lately. It hasn't been completely hot out of the kitchen or as flavorful lately. We ordered the Chicken Quesadilla and 2 pieces were almost empty and there was barely any chicken. When I got my pasta, it seemed like it had been sitting for a while, as the top was barely warm.  2- service has been severely lacking. Tonight, we started with one server who was great and on her game. Then she transferred the table to another server. That wasn't the issue, I understand she wanted to get out of there ( although she was still there when we left? ) The server that took over was nice, but obviously unable to handle the extra table. I'm sure her section was no where near our table, as we were sitting for a while in between visits. Our food was taking a while, which she noticed, but it was still a little too long. After we got our food, she didn't come back until my boyfriend was done. I hadn't even gotten to eat most of my food because I needed to drink something (because of a throat condition) and didn't have anything to drink. Then when she took my plate, instead of asking if we wanted coffee or dessert ( which I did) she just walked away and came back 10 minutes later with menus. At this point, I was sick of waiting and decided to forget about the cheesecake. I understand she has other tables and such, but it's not fun to sit there waiting while everyone else just walks by and looks at your table. Multiple servers saw our empty drink glasses at the edge of the table and no one offered to help. Yeah, it's not their table, but it's a good practice.  I really hope that Cheesecake Factory can turn it around. It was one of my favorites, but lately, I've been wishing we went somewhere else."
Cindi W.,"Georgetown, MA",48,215,3,2.0,5/26/2016,"I have been to some I loved.   But lately this one...for starters the service has seemed pretty impersonal where it used to be fun and friendly.    I love Caesar salad, even if they don't have anchovies, but the dressing only tasted of garlic and a lot of it.   I didn't finish, and neither did the server seek to notice that most was left.   Chicken was moist enough. And the pasta was ok, but nothing to write home about.   They need to up the ante again.   The only thing I really enjoy here is the brown bread....unless of course you want cheese cake lol!"
Roxanne B.,"Lisbon, ME",60,59,97,4.0,5/20/2015,I drive 2 hours and cross 2 state lines to get here because the cheesecake is amazing. They're a little pricey but the food is really good which makes the drive and check worth it. They have quite an extensive menu so there is something just about anybody. Located in the mall is great so you can do some shopping before eating. The service was pretty great considering we were a group of 9 young adults 6 of which were crazy guys. My sister is a picky eater and didn't care for her meal and they didn't have a problem exchanging it for her. Overall great experience will definitely be back.
Jenn P.,"Georgetown, MA",0,11,1,4.0,1/14/2017,Walked in on a Saturday afternoon with a couple friends. Wait was about 20 minutes. Food was great! Tried a few apps and the luau salad as my meal! We split a couple cheesecakes as well and both were amazing! Salted Carmel and snores cheesecakes are a can't miss! Can't ever really go wrong here!
Hanna P.,"Middleton, MA",0,6,1,2.0,6/2/2017,"Honesty just a shitty experience probably won't ever come back to this location. Took us over 45 minutes to get our food, and we ordered a dish to go while we ordered our food. Every time we said excuse me to our waiter Jennifer C she just walked away, maybe if she spent less time chatting with her friends at another table... finally ordered cheesecakes and said it's for the birthday boy because we heard lots of people being sung to and we were brought our cake with no happy birthday. Finally our check came and she didn't put our to go meal in so we had to wait even longer for that meal she said it was ""so crazy"" but if you looked around the place was almost empty.... we heard more people being sung happy birthday to so I stood up and yelled YA HAPPY BIRTHDAY FROM THE CHEESECAKE FACTORY to my friend and Jennifer came over and said ""did someone take away her coke yet???"" So rude will probably never come back after this experience what a shame."
Joseph P.,"Revere, MA",1,31,,2.0,2/5/2017,Oh a great experience.  Wife and daughtar ordered the orange chicken. Chicken was soggy and saturated with grease. Ordered something different burgers took a long time were just okay. The bill came and they charged us fur a more expensive burger took 15 minutes to fix my bill. The restaurant was dead. Not a great experience the second time in two weeks.
Chris L.,"Boston, MA",544,356,153,4.0,5/15/2014,"I love The Cheesecake Factory. I don't care if I'm consuming three days worth of calories in one sitting, the food is simply too delicious to resist. I came here with my roommate because we had received a $10 off coupon, and we figured that we should take advantage of it. I ordered the Chicken and Shrimp Gumbo, and it was amazeballs, naturally. The gumbo has such a nice kick to it, giving the dish that extra something. Our waitress was incredibly pleasant and accommodating. Despite the restaurant being crazy busy (like it usually is) we were seated within 15 minutes and were out of there within an hour and 15. Overall, a wonderful experience and I would definitely return!"
Melina P.,"Fremont, NH",0,1,,1.0,7/5/2017,"Where do I start? My family and I came here to eat a quick lunch/dinner after we found out PF Changs next door recently closed. Since we don't live nearby, we always grab a few slices of cheesecake before we leave, but we don't usually eat in. We decided what the heck, let's do it. So we went in and after admiring the eye opening cheesecake display we waited to be seated. After finding the hostess, she took our name and told us it would be a few minutes. We got seated in a booth that had food underneath it so the young women swept it up before we sat down. A few minutes later, our waiter came over and asked what we wanted to drink. We then looked at the menu and ordered. I tried to order the $19.95 Seared Ahi Tuna, but, of course, they were out of Tuna. I then ordered the grilled salmon. When the food finally arrived, it was quite bland and didn't have much flavor. I think I ate more of the bread we were given than my actually dish. After the disappointing food, we ordered cheesecake and hoped for something. I ordered the Oreo Extreme Cheesecake with hot fudge on the side. This came pretty quick and looked pretty good. After eating about half and saving the rest for home, I got the 85 dollar bill. With tip, this $100 dollar dinner was not worth any of it. If I could've given this experience 0 stars I would've if I didn't have the cheesecake. All in all, the Cheesecake Factory should stick to cheesecake and that's it. We will not be going back to eat in there anytime soon."
