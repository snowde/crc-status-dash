Chris S.,"Peabody, MA",38,26,,5.0,5/12/2016,The spicy chicken sandwich is huge and amazing. I love the fries at the Cheesecake Factory and how they package them. Both items have great flavor. Best part is the spicy chipotle mayo.
Elizabeth E.,"Medford, MA",2,16,5,5.0,3/21/2015,"I do not believe in chain restaurants, but I believe in The Cheesecake Factory. This is a very specific review. I cannot speak of the dessert or of the dining atmosphere. I always go alone for lunch- straight to the small bar. I get the seared tuna tataki salad. Every time, the service is wonderful, and the food is reliably delicious. Their coffee is good and strong- a rarity in these types of eateries. Thank you Cheesecake Factory. Five thumbs up."
T C.,"Weymouth, MA",1,39,1,1.0,5/4/2016,"This review concerns service only, specifically a dishonest charge. My son goes to school near this restaurant and frequents it on occasion. 4/8/16 he went there for dinner with friends and used a credit card to pay his bill. Today I got the credit card statement and the charge had been rounded up a couple bucks! I think that's dishonest and shameful! It's not a lot of money and likely not worth the hassle of disputing the charge with the credit card company, but I think we have all visited Cheesecake Factory for the last time, here in Peabody or the Braintree one we usually go to. Pay close attention to your bill!!"
Alise K.,"Portland, ME",94,359,511,4.0,3/9/2014,"We sat at the bar. Excellent service. We ordered off the ""light"" lunch menu. I had the lettuce wraps. Sooo good. The rest of us had a chopped salad, huge and delicious, and another order of chicken lettuce wraps.  Two pieces of cheesecake to go and we were off to continue shopping"
Dave H.,"Boston, MA",22,132,67,4.0,4/5/2014,"It is the Cheesecake factory, so why bother with a review huh?  It is the best franchise restaurant for sure.  Try the cajun pasta... The service at this one is much better than previous visits in other locations.  This place is great."
Fred L.,"Newton, NH",508,277,679,5.0,3/22/2014,"Cheesecake Factory is one of those restaurants that can be great for a group of people all with different likes when it comes to food. With a menu of more than 18 pages,  each member of your party is sure to find something they like. Salads are very good and plentiful and they have very good pasta dishes. A personal favorite of mine is the Chicken Romano which is thin chicken breasts pounded and prepared with Romano cheese crust served with pasta with a tomato cream sauce."
Jaslanika Pritam B.,"Beverly, MA",10,9,3,2.0,2/9/2016,"I have been to this Cheesecake Factory several times. The food isn't that great and the focus has shifted lately to quantity than quality. The ambiance is good, but lately on the weekends its so crowded like i feel that I'm not at ease in my space. The service is going from okay to worse, my friend ordered a vegetarian dish and specifically told them to not put mushrooms, but they did anyways, and we told the server when our dishes were served, she said she can handpick them out. It was gross! I'm not going back there."
Em B.,"Boston, MA",135,197,935,4.0,11/24/2014,"The Cheesecake Factory has always been a top favorite for me. They have a large menu selection, and great drinks. I have been to this location probably over 10 times, but I'm going to review the most recent visit. The restaurant and mall was absolutely packed, as I believe it was the first Saturday where everyone and their mother wanted to prepare for Christmas shopping. The entire front was filled with about 50 people, and 15-20 strollers. I walked in and asked how long the wait would be for 2 and she said there was no wait which was awesome. Of course we sat in a crowded area with one bench and one uncomfortable chair but beggars can't be choosers. So our server came over to us almost immediately. We ordered waters while we waited to decide but didn't want to spend the extra cash. The waitress forgot to bring the bread, which I reminded her. No harm, no foul but the bread is so key!!! We got Fried Mac n Cheese for an appetizer which was pretty good. I'd give them a 3 out of 5. I love mac and cheese, mac and cheese bites, anything to do with mac and cheese. I believe the ricotta was what threw off the taste a little. And I would have preferred 6 smaller ones than 4 larger ones but that's just me being a pain. Not the best but I'm a sucker for mac and cheese so. For my meal I ordered the Chicken Avocado Club because I couldn't commit to all of the flavors all the other dishes offer, while my mom ordered the Louisiana Chicken Pasta. It took about 10-15 minutes to get which was great because we were starving. My mom said her pasta was spicy but delicious, she really enjoyed it. My sandwich was very good but hard to eat because of how tall it was. Then I had the Chocolate Godiva Cheesecake with Glazed Strawberries for dessert, while my mom ordered the Raspberry Lemon Cake Cheesecake? I always get the same dessert because I don't want to commit to and $8 slice of something I may not like. The Raspberry Lemon Cake Cheesecake was really good. I like how the bottom half isa  cake and the top half is cheesecake. The whipped cream at TCF is too heavy for such rich cheesecakes. We ordered 1 appetizer to split, 2 meals, and 2 slices of cheesecake and it was still almost $70. I thought skipping on the alcohol would make it less expensive. Nope!  In a past visit, I have wanted one of their signature drinks that they took off the menu and they were able to make it for me. I really appreciate that. Also found out they serve omelettes/breakfast all day. May be worth a try sometime.  TCF has good food, great dessert, great drinks, nice ambiance/ decor, friendly busy servers, and is definitely a spot you go for a casual hangout, or get together."
Annie Z.,"Worcester, MA",2,2,,2.0,10/27/2015,"I have been to this particular location multiple times and the experiences have been fine. Recently I went with a group of 9 to celebrate a friend's birthday during their Sunday brunch. The food took almost an hour to come out and when it did two of the orders were wrong. We started with one waitress that transferred our table to another waiter and never told us about the switch. When the staff noticed we were antsy for our meals, the manager came to our table saying ""they would do anything to make our experience enjoyable."" Said in the most non-believable tone ever. Though the waiter that was transferred to our table was very friendly and nice, he did not check in once to see how our meals were and if we needed anything, which we did.  One girl ordered a breakfast sandwich eggs over hard another girl ordered a breakfast sandwich eggs over easy with no mayo and no ham. Both sandwiches, which we were told were the reason our meals took so long because they got messed up and had to be fixed, came out wrong in the end anyway. Both had ham and mayo with the eggs cooked at the wrong temperature. The waiter asked one girl ""if she had touched hers yet"" and ""if they just wanted to switch"". Which wouldn't make a difference because one girl didn't want ham and mayo anyway. Side note, the birthday girl had to suffer through dry toast because our table was completely avoided after the incident.  The food was okay. Reading the menu we were excited for our meals but nobody was blown away by the quality. Should've gone to a diner instead."
Vincent V.,"Woburn, MA",63,8,9,4.0,11/10/2015,Went with wife and niece. Niece got spaghetti and meatballs but they were too salty the waitress kindly took it off the menu was very fast and my food was outstanding will be back again
Tracy B.,"Everett, MA",158,857,3017,3.0,5/5/2012,"Its like any other Cheesecake Factory... Drinks are over priced, meals are over priced but the food is OOHHH SOOO GOOODDD!!!!   This was our Diet cheat night birthday dinner!!!  We ate too much, drank too much, but had a damn good time doing it... We were seated at the bar area which I hate but then after all it was a decent time... I understand the more tables you cram in the place the more people you can seat... but I hate that we sit soo close to other tables... This night was decent, the waitress could have been more attentive, but it was good...  We will go again, and then just complain after that we ate too much & spent entirely way too much!"
A B.,"Boston, MA",0,23,,3.0,10/13/2015,"I love it or hate it.  There's no in between.  I go and enjoy the food.  I go back and there is something wrong (the food is ice cold, so salt it is inedible, whatever) then I try it again a few months later and it's great.  I can't figure it out.   They used to offer a gift card or a free dish or something when the food was so inedible you just left it sitting there but the last time I went, nothing.  I got a ""oh thanks for letting us know, they definitely did something wrong and over salted the pasta, we made new."" but I got nothing.   I'll go back again and it will probably be great.  It's so hit or miss."
Kaitlin B.,"Methuen, MA",189,100,35,4.0,2/25/2015,"Cheesecake Factory has become a staple for the boo and I, we just love it. Wait is never ridiculous, and service is always on point. I usually get the same thing and the other night noticed what I get wasn't on the menu anymore. Waitress & Chef were amazing and still made it for me anyway, and that is what I call SERVICE ! BBQ Salmon is to die for, perfectly cooked salmon, mashed potatoes, yummy corn medley, and topped off with the best onion rings ! I've also come and just got a bunch of apps, as well as brunch. You truly cannot go wrong with coming here. Friendly staff, and huge portions of food."
Robert H.,"Salem, MA",7,6,,3.0,4/11/2016,"Don't go there on a Sunday night. Before I begin this review has nothing to do with our server, she was great, everything a  server should be, well worth a 25% tip. However, very loud music and now I know why I have a flash light app on my phone. Very dark. With the amount of people there you'd think it would be quicker service. Waited a while for our food and desert. Food was good but the wait...yikes. It was 9 PM. That's why I try not to go out on Sundays. Again I wish I got the waitress's name. She was the best."
Patrick M.,"Avon, MA",0,8,1,2.0,9/13/2015,This place is going down hill.  Particularly if you happen to eat at the bar.  While waiting 20 mins for my chicken piccata they were going to bring me some bread.  Which after about 10 min. they did.  Unfortunately they didn't give me a napkin or more importantly silverware to at least spread butter on the bread.  After literally another 10 min. of being ignored by the female bartender and still no piccata either I just got up and left.  Probably won't be back.
Jennifer R.,"Danvers, MA",56,325,25,5.0,11/22/2015,"My husband and I frequent the cheesecake factory often and we have never had a bad experience at this location! The staff is always extremely accommodating and professional. The food is always great and the menu has so many options we never leave displeased. My two favorites are the chicken avocado club and the luau salad. My mother has a food allergy which they also handle very well, we have met a manager named Charlie more than once who goes above and beyond. I know often times people like to avoid ""chains"" but this is a great option when going out to eat!"
Marc G.,"Malden, MA",0,7,,1.0,6/8/2016,"Terrible service. We have been here numerous times in the past. It used to be quick great service with very good wait staff. Today was a complete disappointing disaster. I had the day off from work with my wife which is a very rare occasion and we decided to go to cheesecake factory for lunch. We had to wait about 10 minutes to even see a waiter. When the waiter came by, my wife wasn't  ready to order so the waiter came back about 10 minutes later. We gave our order and she asked if we wanted bread and we said yes. So, about 15 minutes later she walked by and said oh you wanted bread? We got bread about 5 minutes later. Then we don't see her for about 30 to 45 minutes and she came by and said that our order never went through that we would have to wait even longer. She treated it like no big deal. I was pissed and hadn't eaten all  day. She offered to let us talk to the manager which never happened. She then disappeared yet again. This completely ruined a very rare day off for us. I am so disappointed in the service we received here. I cant believe there was no manager oversight like every other restaurant. Just horrible overall."
Rebecca T.,"Beverly, MA",0,3,,1.0,4/3/2017,"Went in for a joint birthday dinner for my stepdads 50th and my brothers 7th birthday since they both fall on the same day.  Our experience was terrible. I called 5 days before our visit to set up a reservation for 12 people and the hostess told me they do not take reservation and to come in 45 minutes before we wish to be seated. Most of us in the party know it would be at least an hour so come Sunday my sister went in to put her name on the list. She was told she would wait minimum 2 hours. She told the hostess that we called and were told to be there 45 before we wished to be seated. My sister told the hostess that we were misinformed and had planned around the information we were given before which is why we did not make a reservation. The hostess told my sister that they do not reservations because it does not benefit the restaurant and that we did not meet their requirements to their policy so we had to wait. The manager was then evolved and showed interest in accommodating us for about 10 minutes. At this point the restaurant was still not busy. He told my sister he would do everything he could to have us sat in an hour and apologized. An hour and a half later we ask the hostess if she had any idea how much longer and she told us they were just waiting for tables to clear so they can be cleaned. At this point everyone in my party was hungry and frustrated as people were coming in and being sat a lot faster then we were. One girl was pregnant and asked for a water which she never received. The manager was no where to be seen and no one came up to us to keep us updated on the status of the tables. After over two hours waiting, we decided we were going to leave. At this point the manager was at the cheesecake station ignoring us and doing work on the POS system. In the 2 hours we waited we were not offered a drink or any thing during our wait. All the staff ignored us and did not try to be friendly with us. We asked about our tables a few times and were answered rudely as if we were being annoying. After almost 2 hours and a half my sister went up to the manager and told him we had waited over two hours and that we were frustrated and we were leaving. Apparently he had forgotten about us because he spoke to my sister as if he had no idea who she was. She repeated back to him what he had told her earlier and said ok has it been that long? she replied with yes its been way longer its been over two hours. He said ok and walked away. Less than a minute later we were sat. At this point everyone in the party was already cranky and hungry. The waiter was nice and quick. However during our dinner not once did the manager come by to check on us or apologize for our inconvenience. The food came out quick but was not very good. At the end of the meal we at least expected the birthday boys dessert to be comp from a $317 tab. However we were not compensated for anything and we were shown no remorse for our inconvenience. On top of that, they brought dessert over and sang when the birthday boys were not even at the table! The 7 year old was so disappointed because that's all he had waited for all night was to blow out his candle. When my sister told them this one of the servers gave her attitude and told her they could sing again if it was a huge deal. She told him to forget it. The staff seemed to be very annoyed with us and seemed even more annoyed when we told them it was someone's birthday dinner. The whole dinner was ruined and the whole night was a disaster.  We experienced terrible customer service and will not be returning to this cheesecake."
Duncan M.,"Peabody, MA",1,16,,4.0,6/26/2016,"Food was good, server was really nice. At the start there was some confusion with the service though. We had a server come over and take our order for drinks and then a couple minutes later another server came over. Turns out it was a shift change."
Queen M.,"Boston, MA",5,46,3,5.0,2/22/2015,"Cheesecake Factory has always been a favorite for our family, no matter where we travel in NE.  If there's a Cheesecake in the vicinity of where we are visiting, you'll find us dining for lunch or dinner 'at least' once. Tonight when we took a consensus of where everyone wanted to go, the answer ""Cheesecake""!  So off we go, with the anticipation of great food and great service!! Thank you Cheesecake for providing such great quality restaurants for our dining enjoyment, and which offer a family friendly environment!!  =)"
