Paul D.,"Boston, MA",2,17,,4.0,3/18/2016,Good selection of wines and food at the bar. The crowd is usually quiet so it's nice for dinner.
Renee M.,"Boston, MA",49,18,25,4.0,3/21/2015,Always a great experience. We enjoy bringing the kids here for lunch. Food is always good.  Wait Staff is friendly and knowledgeable about menu. Love the decor and the deserts are fabulous!
Megan M.,"Temecula, CA",208,19,1,5.0,3/10/2016,Extremely nice staff. Clean. Great food. Small wait. Excellent server! Celebrated my great grandmas 100th birthday and they made it very special for her. I would recommend this place!!
K Tanna K.,"Lynnfield, MA",0,52,13,4.0,8/17/2015,Good food. So much on the menu to choose from. Too full from dinner to eat dessert so we took a mango keylime cheesecake to go. Can't wait to try it later tonight.
Tony M.,"Peabody, MA",1,12,,4.0,3/7/2016,Very classy as are all the cheescake factorys :) the menu is a little on the overwhelming side as they offer a million things haha the food is very good but im a little lost on what type if restaurant they are still would recommend them
Marguerite C.,"Peabody, MA",0,26,,1.0,3/7/2016,"Tried to see if my experience would be better than last time but sadly, no.  Sat at bar around 2 pm.  Pretty poor service.  Basically ignored.  Greek salad pretty bad.  No lettuce per say, long strings of arugula.  Don't plan to come back.  So overated and bad food and service.  Asked bartender about salad prep. Gave me a hard time."
Alicia S.,"Boston, MA",61,589,27,2.0,10/14/2014,It use to be my favorite place but my food has stinked everytime I went. The pasta is awful very gross from being too salty to not being cooked. I think for the price it shouldn't be so yucky
Dean C.,"Kingsport, TN",468,92,,5.0,9/10/2015,"I ate here a couple years ago, ordered a pizza and it was excellent. The service was great and everything I had was very good. I over heard the customers at the next table over joking about always getting dessert, because no matter how full they were from the meal they always had room in their ""dessert stomach"" to order dessert. I took their advice, and had dessert and it was excellent."
Ribblet N.,"Andover, MA",41,149,24,4.0,4/12/2015,"Sunday brunch is until 2.  Came here at 1 and was seated right away, no lines!  They have an appetizer sweet corn tamale cakes.  You have to try these!  Very yummy."
R C.,"Melrose, MA",1,30,1,2.0,6/18/2016,"I have never had a bad meal at the Cheesecake Factory...until today. I ordered a pasta dish which came with watery, soupy sauce and overcooked noodles. I didn't think you could mess up pasta, but apparently you can! The waiter asked if I wanted to pack it bc I didn't eat it and I explained it wasn't good. What's worse is the waiter didn't take it off the check, even after we had to order another meal to take home. He seemed new and nervous so my husband and I didn't want to get into the whole ""get the manager""bit, but every restaurant  I've ever been to automatically does if you aren't happy! I'm so disappointed, never thought I'd say that about my once favorite place."
Jamie B.,"Salem, MA",188,154,399,3.0,6/24/2014,"My friend and I were wandering around the North Shore Mall and decided to go to The Cheesecake Factory for dinner. It was a beautiful night, so we requested outdoor seating.   There are two large patio areas that can accommodate parties of various sizes.  Our waiter was very attentive and promptly took our drink order. I tried the skinny cosmopolitan, which is a lighter version of a Cosmo but still had delicious taste and flavor- at only 150 calories. The dark and sourdough bread were both were both warm and the waiter brought more throughout our meal. The Chinese Chicken Salad was just as described on the menu- and a very large portion! Mounds of rice noodles and wontons covered the tons of romaine and chicken. The salad dressing was sweet and I has the dressing on the side so that I could use the amount that I wanted. We had a delicious meal and will be heading back again soon."
Marc H.,"Wakefield, MA",74,36,,3.0,11/25/2014,"I'm not really a huge fan of this place. I really liked the atmosphere and it was really roomy and big. but the food quality wasn't the best, i was expecting a lot better because everybody talks about this place very highly. I was disappointed. Food: 7 Environment: 9 Service: 5 Cleanliness: 10 Price: 7 Overall: 6"
Derek S.,"Pasadena, CA",4,64,,5.0,3/28/2015,"I absolutely love the Cheesecake Factory. Although their menu is a labyrinth to navigate through because it is so big, the kitchen is very capable of making all of the dishes well. The dishes are huge too! I'm always stuffed when I go here, which is something of an accomplishment since I'm almost always hungry and have a large appetite. I suppose it's somewhat of a cliche to enjoy chain restaurants, but I don't really care when the food is excellent. The best part of this place is of course, the cheesecake. My personal favorite is the key lime cheesecake."
Leah B.,"Rochester, NH",0,16,3,2.0,7/5/2015,"The only time in my life I have ever left less than a 20% tip. The waitress only took our order and then disappeared. The waiter serving the table next to us was the one that refilled our drinks, another random waitress brought our food out, and our waitress was only seen when it was time to pay. But she took her sweet time coming back for the card. As we were leaving we realized the problem, she was too busy chit chatting at the hostess desk to pay any sort of attention to her tables. Don't waste your time with this place, there are so many amazing restaurants in the area. Cheesecake factory is over priced and the food isn't worth it. Go here for cheese cake but only if you don't feel like driving into Boston, because you will find much better there!"
Sonia R.,"Lynn, MA",3,4,,2.0,4/27/2016,Sat at bar for dinner around 5:15pm. It was pretty much empty and I was pretty much ignored.  Hard to get a drink. Hard to get my food order...hard to get second drink. Had leftovers...wasn't even asked if I wanted to take it home. Not good service :(
Chris R.,"Haverhill, MA",11,5,4,2.0,6/23/2015,"Walked into the restaurant with an open mind.  Server was having a bad day apparently.  Inattentive, grumpy, and short...with talking.  Food was...meh.  Cheesecake was good until we found a long black hair baked into it.  The customer service manager had to asked to come over to the table twice.  When he finally arrived I informed him of the hair and that the rest of the cake should be pulled from the line.  He agreed grabbed the cake and walked away.  He walked up a few minutes later...after we paid...and said that he has to take it off of our bill.  Almost like he was obligated or forced.  Weird...  See needless to say not a very good experience.  I expected better honestly...."
R B.,"Boston, MA",4,185,,2.0,1/2/2016,great desserts but my boss almost killed herself on the GREASY floor near the rest room.  I said something to the hostess as we were walking out and I got a SARCASTIC FAKE sorry and the dude next to her rolled his stupid eyes.  CLEAN your floor jeez your desserts are money makers so use that $ to CLEAN your floor.  Do you want a lawsuit from someone who falls?  I'm not the type to sue but someone else will be.  Take heed and do the right thing. It's like a skating rink.
J P.,"Beverly, MA",17,167,159,2.0,1/28/2014,"Came in tonight looking for a good relaxing meal with my honey . The food was good the service was HORRIBLE our server was MIA most of our meal. I don't expect to have rose petals thrown at my feet or be hand fed but I do expect good service.  She barely checked on us, kept forgetting drinks, and left our plates even after we were clearly finished and finished for sometime. We spent most of our meal just waiting oh and I'm waiting now still which is AWESOME. I am literally writing this review as I'm wait  for it....WAITING!!!! FYI it's a Thursday night not busy at all. I won't be coming back for a while."
Diana L.,"Crown Point, IN",0,33,,5.0,9/29/2015,"One of my all time favorite restaurants.  Excellent food- fish tacos are awesome but there are a lot of other excellent entrees too.  Great service, beautiful décor."
Ian W.,"Pelham, NH",715,3717,5928,4.0,1/16/2012,"The Cheesecake Factory (TCF) is a pretty solid dining option offering a very extensive menu which reads like a storybook with several pages. It can take a while to decide on what to eat since there are so many choices. They also offer small (skinny) plates for those with smaller appetites and watching calories. Lunch specials are offered until 5PM, brunch is offered on Sundays and they also have specials in the bar area (Mondays-Fridays 4PM-6PM) offering selected full size appetizers for only $5.00. I've been to several TCF locations throughout the US and have had very good meals each time, but there was usually quite a wait to be seated. I found some TCF gift cards (a few years old)  which I needed to use up. My friend and I decided to make a special trip from NH to The Cheesecake Factory at the Northshore Mall for an early dinner and arrived here around 3:55PM on a Monday. We were seated immediately at a table in the bar area. Our server Todd arrived promptly and went over the specials and also informed us about the ""bar menu"" with several $5 appetizers listed. For appetizers ($5 each/normally $9.95 each), we ordered the Fried Calamari and the Fire Roasted Fresh Artichoke. The Fried Calamari (rings & tentacles) were coated in a light and crisp tempura batter (not too greasy) and served with a creamy garlic dip and tangy cocktail sauce. The Artichokes (3) were messy to eat, but were very good and fresh and the artichoke hearts were very tender, served with a creamy garlic dip and vinaigrette dressing. For dinner, the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta ($16.95-full sized portion) was very spicy which had tender shrimp, soft boneless chicken sauteed with tomato, onions, and peppers over soft linguini (regular and green noodles) and topped with fresh grated parmesan cheese (optional). My friend ordered the Vietnamese Shrimp Summer Rolls ($5/normally $9.95) three rice paper rolled with bean sprouts, carrots, asparagus, shittake mushrooms, green onion, cilantro, & shrimp, served chiiled over crispy rice noodle & red cabbage and spicy peanut dipping sauce. The food was enjoyable and filling and we needed a box for the leftovers. Unfortunately, we did not save room for cheesecake and coffee, but probably next time. The service was very good, very attentive and informative. The food arrived in timely fashion, the ice waters were refilled and our server made recommendations from the menu.  We will be back!"
