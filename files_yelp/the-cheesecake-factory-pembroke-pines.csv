Ivan B.,"Weston, FL",374,52,71,4.0,1/1/2018,"Cheesecake Factory is what it is: For a chain it's excellent  Good service  Enormous menu,  Large portions, good to share Moderate priced  Good selection of cheese cakes. Not the best ever but very good  Can be very busy with long waits."
Tom Z.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",34,39,42,2.0,1/7/2018,"Came here at 11:58 for brunch was cro dee but not overwhelmed.   Decided to sit at the bar.   Bartender was attentive and dei madly and got our drink order quickly.   Well two orders of bread and over 25 minutes later we're still waiting for our order - two orders of eggs Benedict.    Manager just walked over as I'm writing this so thanks.  Maybe they'll come the meal or drink.  We will see Photo caption reads ""hungry"" thank goodness for bread"
Vince V.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",22,2,,2.0,1/5/2018,"""Cheesecake"" is one of our go to places. We can usually count on the good and service to be top notch. Yesterday, this was not the case. When we arrived, we got a table immediately. The hostess told us that was because it was cold out.  Our server was a guy that seemed in a rush. Both my son and I emphasized that we like our French fries brown/well done. I got the feeling he wasn't paying attention. After a half hour we still didn't have our food, but we had received two bread baskets. A woman came to our table to say she would take over our table. She reeked of cigarettes. We hate cigarette smoke. We asked if the order had been put in and she told us that was the case. We still waited, and after a while some food arrived. The fries looked like fast food fries. Not to Cheesecake Factory standards, and definitely not brown as requested. We asked the server to get them browned a little more, and also for the other ones to come out brown. When two more servings of fries came out, they were not well done... There were more mistakes and more waits. We ended up waiting for the check over 20 minutes. What a disappointment. They probably had the B team working."
Nancy L.,"Davie, FL",150,36,33,4.0,12/26/2017,Lunch specials for pasta served until 5pm. Obviously known for their delicious cheesecakes. Reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because the meal I had today was not up to par. The chicken is not juicy at all and the penne pasta was very hard. I feel that it's a little overpriced for a meal so small and not worth it but to eat dessert there is great!
Dolly F.,"Hollywood, FL",71,28,103,4.0,9/22/2017,"Considering it's a chain, service, food and drinks are always good  We've been to several different locations and they are consistent in their brand. It's great place for large groups, and couples . Portions enough for 2!"
Amy S.,"Tamarac, FL",200,535,1781,4.0,8/20/2017,"This is what every girls lunch needs... an endless menu, window table, cute server and good food. When you aren't sure what you want, this is the place.  The menu has everything. The appetizers are all enticing, salads, sandwiches, entrees and don't forget the dessert.  These are formulas driven and in my experience consistently serve good food in a fast pace environment. I do consider Cheesecake Factory an everyday go to stop."
Foodie ..,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",153,75,381,3.0,8/9/2017,Pros: Food is consistent   Service was good Atmosphere was nice Place was busy as usual Cons : But the Cheesecakes are expensive as usual and now they have made the slices of cheesecakes much smaller.
Michelle H.,"Plantation, FL",195,69,399,5.0,7/30/2017,"I don't normally go this location due to the distance but when I do, they don't disappoint. I went on a Sunday & it was crowded but we got seats for 7 people in less than the wait time we were told which was 40-50 mins. Got a table outside and our waiter was very nice. Our water was quick to get refilled & all the food came out hot. The bill came out in one check but our waiter didn't mind splitting it up & did so with a great attitude. This place is so convenient as the parking (if you're lucky) is literally a couple steps away from the entrance & there's shopping all around before or after your meal!"
Patou Tou C.,"Edison, NJ",18,9,,1.0,12/28/2017,"Poor service! Took an hour for the food to be served for a small party of 5 and the the quality of the food was definitely NOT worth the price. Even after we complained to the manager, he did nothing to make up for this horrible experience. Shame on this establishment for this lack lust experience!!!"
David H.,"Davie, FL",1,12,49,1.0,8/31/2017,"This has never changed. It's sort of a bad food emporium for shoppers too desperate to go elsewhere. The service may be the worst in this capital of rude, non English speaking help ().  They eventually bring several menus full of the most unhealthy garbage I've eaten in years. I was at a Cheesecake Factory a few years ago because it was next to an Apple Store and it was very much like this experience. I stupidly thought that some of the Apple might rub off, but no and this is exactly the same unpleasant experiment. What really gets me is that they are too cheap to install WiFi. Oh well, it gives me an opportunity to jot down a few thoughts; I'm sad to say they are all bad. When I asked for lemon I got NO LEMON for the oh so so sweet dumplings. Yuck! Nevermore quoth the raven."
Kimberly G.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",56,88,278,4.0,12/12/2016,"This Cheesecake Factory is located in the Shops at Pembroke Gardens outdoor shopping center. I like this location because it is perfect after a day of shopping. They have indoor and outdoor seating, and even on the busiest day I have never had to wait long to be served. The restaurant is spacious and clean, and the staff is friendly and professional. As with every other Cheesecake Factory, the bread is to die for! They have a very extensive menu where you can get whatever you are craving - pasta, steak, seafood, burgers, sandwiches, sushi, Chinese food, Thai food, Mexican food - they literally have everything! I recommend the Tex Mex egg rolls if you are in the mood for a Mexican appetizer. The orange chicken is delicious and so is the Bang Bang chicken and shrimp - my favorite dish. I highly recommend if you like curried food.  Their drink menu is awesome because they have a lot of strong and fruity cocktails which I am a huge fan of. You can't go wrong with the Mai Tai!  They also have a skinny menu for meals and drinks if you are watching your weight, and they let you know of their product is gluten free or began friendly.  The cheesecake here is delicious and the serving size is enough to share. My favorites are the white chocolate caramel, the oreo cheesecake, and the strawberry cheesecake!"
Gabriella G.,"Davie, FL",1,44,67,4.0,7/1/2017,"We went out for a late lunch-- and chose stuff we don't usually... this was the best idea ever!! Well, Cheesecake Factory never fails, imho. They are a good food factory! I never even make it to the cheesecake cause the food is soooo good!!  So this time we went for appetizers: the 4 kind of eggrolls ... and we were pleasantly pleased! Well-- to be honest, we loooove the bread too! So bread and appetizers and iced tea... then I had my ""low cal"" salad- hahaha. Louisiana Chicken Pasta and I don't remember the salad name-- but it was GOOOD!"
Paola J.,"Sunrise, FL",106,13,47,4.0,4/7/2017,"Let's be honest, how many years have the Cheesecake Factory been around?  Pretty much a Very long time.  When I was younger I went to the Cheesecake Factory in Aventura Mall for the first time, and being only a kid,  and  were all I cared for. But oh  boy what a horrible experience I had with what I ordered . I don't remember what I ate (not sure if it's repressed memory by now or I was just to horrified) but nonetheless, I remember telling my mom no hell No I'm not eating whatever crap was in front of me. Sent it back, remember the second meal being a burger and fries. Nope, didn't happen. Didn't like it, didn't think it was normal; so we sent it back. I ended up telling my mom at a young age to never take me back to Cheesecake Factory EVER!!l (too cute, little old me) Being a real foodie means you LOVE  FOOD, you ENJOY  FOOD at any given moment, you SAVOR  flavors and you take your time to taste, inspect, and move on with the next bite before the waiter ask you is everything ok?! Yea, it's serious business being a foodie. FAST FORWARD to 2027, In February I gave the Cheesecake Factory another shot for my grandmothers birthday, unfortunately I didn't have a choice in the matter especially when have relatives from out of the country are in town. this time around changing my location and going to the newly renovated mall center near Pembroke Pines mall.  My family and I walked in and of course we expected a time as anyone who goes out to eat in a Sunday. The wait was long nearly 1 hour, the place was so crowded, I've seen The Aventura location crowded before but this....this was a whole new level of groups and individuals just sitting and walking out waiting for their little machine to vibrate. Finally we were seated, the place is grande, spacious, elegant with high ceilings and the atmosphere was so different than i remember the Aventura location. Changing scenery did the job. This time. I ate like a champ, the experience was one worth enough for me to create a review on YELP (kind of reminds me of the South Park episode, when the whole town business was controlled by YELP reviewers I had the fried calamari and the Cajun pasta and we order pizza and salads and drinks, best part yet, this location has a mirror where a wall should have been separating the kitchen from the restaurants. Super clean, not quiet but the atmosphere is definitely one we enjoyed dining in."
Natasha R.,"Killeen, TX",16,13,,3.0,12/27/2017,"Arrive at the factory with a group of 3. It was very busy but it didn't take long for our group to be seated.  Our waitress was great got our drinks immediately and took our order. I ordered the shrimp scampi, my teen daughter ordered the shrimp and sausage pasta. My friend had the soup of the day which was a chicken tortilla. My friend didn't like the soup she said it was to salty when it arrived. My teen liked her pasta with the sausage and shrimp. My daughter and friend ordered a lemonade my daughter had the strawberry and my friend had a cucumber lemonade. They bother said it was extra sweet and had to get a cup of water to dilute it.  I like the service but didn't like the food. My pasta on the shrimp scampi was dry. There was not enough sauce on the the plate to coat the pasta.  I was eating dry pasta and choking on it. I didn't even eat 25% of the pasta because it was dry and choking to swallow. I didn't like my meal. That why I gave this place a 3 star. The service was great."
Tracy W.,"Hollywood, FL",11,40,30,4.0,12/20/2017,"Julios, was an excellent server. He recommended new items and was very attentive.  I hope I spelled his name right.  Anyway it took us about 30 minutes to get a seat but once we sat down the servicing to pretty quick for men. My son had the BBQ Burger and I had the four cheese pasta with chicken. The meal was pretty standard despite the prices. You can always expect if you're going to The Cheesecake Factory that the prices are going to be pretty steep the portions are pretty huge so you get what you pay for however if you want to save on cost split your meal. There's enough for two people when you order so this should be simple we had the crab bite appetizer now let me tell you this was the first time that I had this appetizer and it was delicious I will definitely order this again. I think in the future if I go to Cheesecake Factory I will just stick with appetizers I would not get a whole meal I never eat the whole thing and I usually always end up caring take out containers. If you never been the cheesecake before please expect to bring your wallet and at least spend $70 for two people if you're ordering appetizers and a drink you can cut the cost and make it about 60 if you take the drinks out LOL. Cheesecake is a great go-to restaurant however Pembroke Square Gardens where it's located is overcrowded and hard to find parking but I guess it's all apart of the package."
Itala C.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",16,14,18,4.0,11/15/2017,I love this place but the last two times I wasn't to happy. Three week ago I wasn't happy with food at pembroke mall and yesterday at sawgrass they took forever for the food. The service is amazing
Steve W.,"Southwest Ranches, FL",76,63,33,3.0,2/26/2017,"Service can be spotty but overall it still offers the widest variety of choices, decent portions and top quality ingredients for generally reasonable prices.  I had an excellent turkey burger on a great brioche bun. Not the most imaginative selection but it's safe to say if you want any type of burger you'll be satisfied with the results here."
S L.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,18,,5.0,11/15/2017,We met friends here Sunday for Brunch  Got there at about 10:30. No wAit at all Our server was fantastic!! I ordered Eggs Benedict opted for the spinach and tomato version  DELICIOUS!!! Did I mention the best tasting coffee?? We will definitely go back and try another tasty treat!!
Maria S.,"Parque Avellaneda, Buenos Aires, Argentina",0,5,,4.0,12/26/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory can never go wrong. Disregarding the extensive wait on a busy night, Cheesecake's menu can satisfy any taste buds. In all effort to comply with dietary needs, food choices range anywhere from steaks to burritos. With so many options to chose from you will find yourself coming back to devour the menu."
Alicia C.,"Brooklyn, NY",118,191,461,1.0,7/7/2017,"Super disappointed at this place. I've been to other cheesecake factory and food was delicious. At this location, portions were tiny and super greasy. I have the alfredo pasta and it was a bath of oil. Chicken was dry. Tuna was nicely cooked but there were 4 small pieces. Please go to others cheesecake factories since they are so many in FL. The mall is nice, a beautiful strip with stores on the side. Nice for a stroll."
Valerie C.,"Hollywood, FL",28,57,211,2.0,7/21/2017,"Service here is getting lax and the food is getting inferior and costly for the wait time. My food was mediocre, however the patron next to me waited almost 45 minutes for chili. You know that's not happening. I got the gumbo on rice and was disappointed; it used to be tasty, now if just bland. No longer worth the wait time too many other places to compete for my dollar."
Gladys D.,"Palm Springs North, FL",15,39,19,4.0,11/20/2016,Waiting time for first como first 45 to 50 minutes  Delay at the entrance dish came with all together. The waiters was wonderful all time . I do appreciate that i will be back soon
Jerry D.,"Cutler Bay, FL",104,117,113,4.0,11/7/2016,"This is our go to place, me and my high school girlfriends. One of the best things about Cheesecake Factory, is there is something for everyone. Pasta, salad, burgers, fish, and obviously CHEESECAKE! Today I ordered the kale salad and opted for the fried calamari as my entree, not so healthy but calamari is my fave.  I always order the passion iced tea, passion is a good thing! The salad was nicely seasoned and had the right amount of dressing. The calamari could have been cooked just a tad bit longer, or possibly a bit less breading, but it was still yummy.  Nicely seasoned too. And since it's November, PUMPKIN CHEESECAKE!! My girlies and I always meet up at this time of year to taste this baby. Geez, I thought I was going to explode.  J got the beet salad (yes!) and the lettuce wraps, I almost traded plates! E started with the artichoke, great choice, and the greek salad, to save room for her pumpkin cheesecake. K had a side salad and the chicken pasta from the skinnylicious menu, WOW!  Everything was fresh and tasty.  Only sorta kinda gripe was the time it took to get the check."
Martin A.,"Washington, DC",0,14,,1.0,5/6/2017,"I love their mango & chicken avocado salad. Out of the ten (or more) times I've ordered the salad, something is always missing. Either there's no avocado  or there's no bread .  I'm not sure why they are always cheating me of something (by not giving me everything I'm paying for), but it makes me wonder what else Cheesecake Factory skims customers on.  While I enjoy their salad, I wouldn't recommend this store.  If I already know before checking the bag that not every thing I ordered is in it, then this is clearly not a good store to buy from."
Rosio G.,"Hialeah, FL",30,107,290,4.0,3/16/2017,"Out of all the food chains restaurants, The Cheesecake Factory is definitely my favorite. This particular location is located in Pembroke Gardens Shops where you can grab a bite or a drink after a day of shopping. I think this location is also good for any occasion, like a family gathering. There is always a line, expect to wait about 30 minutes to an hour.  I feel that every single item at Cheesecake Factory is good, no matter what you order. I've had many items on their menu and they've amazing. I've tried their mac and cheese balls, one of my favorites, small portion good enough for 2. I've tried their egg roll sampler, seared tuna, nachos, burgers. As far as entrees, my favorite are the steak Diane with mashed potatoes. The steak is like a filet, it's so soft and tender and the sauce is amazing. I've also tried many of their pastas, carbonara, jambalaya, shrimp pasta, and even spaghetti with meatballs. I haven't had any complaints, food is always solid good. I'm giving them 4 stars because of the wait times, service really depends on your server, and parking is so limited."
Courtney G.,"Doral, FL",188,1,2,5.0,9/16/2016,My Grandma and I went for lunch as soon as we walked in we were able to be served. Our waiter was nice and allowed us to look around before asking us what we wanted. we settled in and ordered the avocado egg rolls for our appetizers and after ordered our entrées. I had the chicken lettuce wraps and she had a well done hamburger.  it was so good that we even took half of our meals home.
Lukane V.,"Hialeah, FL",4,7,10,1.0,2/14/2017,I give you 1 stars do to the fact the we ordered for take out and I got there before time so my food can be fresh. Well the aguacate egg roll  was soggy and nasty  My steak Diane had no flavor so mushroom and sauce  was extra watered down the meat had no flavor maybe it was my fault for no looking in the bag before departing the restaurant.but I will  NEVER ORDER FOR TAKE OUT AT THIS LOCATION ITS HORRIBLE ..  $70.00 just wasted ..
Jeffrey M.,"Hollywood, FL",171,30,17,4.0,1/22/2017,"A bit pricey. But the portion are more than filling. The place always seems to be clean and the service is fast. The lighting is a bit dark but overall, the place is nice.  They are always busy. Apparently, the cheesecakes are the only thing that comes frozen. I still think they taste better great. The Oreo cheesecake is my favorite (it might be called cookies and cream)."
Natalie C.,"Miami Lakes, FL",166,139,386,4.0,6/9/2016,"I'm really not a big fan of chain restaurants, however, I have never had a bad foodie experience in this Cheesecake Factory location. Yesterday we had a farewell party for our co-worker. We had a big party, about 25 people, and I am impressed how well organized the whole process was. Especially, that they split checks for each and every individual that was seated. That's a huge plus for big parties. They sat us near the bar area so that was convenient. They have great happy hour specials and an array of cheap apps and salads that are included in the happy hour menu. Happy hour is from 4-6pm.  I ordered the Vietnamese Shrimp Summer Rolls for $5.50. It was an amazing deal and I got very full from just that alone. The roll is filled with vegetables, shrimp, and rice noodles. Its wrapped in rice paper and it comes with a peanut and spicy chili dipping sauce. The spicy chili was my favorite! I also ordered the fried avocado rolls. I cannot even begin to describe the amount of joy I had eating this amazing appetizer. You know the section of yelp that asks what the last food you were to eat if it was your last day on earth? I have to add this app in there. It was THAT GOOD!  I could not for the life of me leave the Cheesecake Factory without having a cheesecake. So I had one slice of the Chris Outrageous Cheesecake. Anyone that knows me knows that I ALWAYS leave room for dessert. This cheesecake has to be the best cheesecake I HAVE EVER HAD!!! This cheesecake consists of a Layer of moist chocolate cake, a layer of Brownie, Toasted Coconut-Pecan Frosting and Creamy Chocolate Chip Coconut Cheesecake. Who created this??? Was it Chris? I want to meet this guy and hug him! And also curse him for creating such a heavenly sensation filled with a week full of calories, fat, carbs, and sugar. Oh well, It was worth every bite. I enjoyed immensely. Total euphoria.  Trust me...order this cheesecake and you experience a slice of heaven!  PS. The cheesecake factory has $6 valet which is worth it so you don't have to park 2 miles away. Or maybe after eating here it'll be worth parking far to burn some calories. LOL!"
Rune L.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",832,27,2,5.0,4/24/2017,"Just had dinner here, Abraham was my server. He was great! I work in the service industry and his hospitality and service was exceptional! The food was great! Had a lovely little dinner !"
Arlen S.,"Hialeah, FL",105,80,395,4.0,8/15/2016,"In the past I was never the biggest fan of this restaurant but maybe I was not choosing the right plates. I came this time to celebrate my best friends birthday and I will admit I really enjoyed it. I ordered from the Skinnylicious menu, the avocado and chicken sandwich which came with a salad. My best friend has pasta and she also ordered some avocado rolls which were really good. I was very happy with what I ordered, it had so much flavor and the avocado was fresh. We also ordered dessert. Oreo cheesecake!!! It was to die for. I dont nornally do cheesecake but this was just way too good. I think I will give this place some more chances and try new things more often."
Nat L.,"Weston, FL",206,201,334,2.0,11/18/2015,"Delicious food but service not what it's like at other locations. I love food, which makes it easier to love the Cheesecake Factory. Who in their right mind doesn't love cheesecake?! Even people with dairy intolerance love the stuff, but today's visit left me wanting better service. Our party of five arrived, placed our orders... Every one got their food except for me, I waited 10 mins till I was finally bright my food. The chicken piccata is my favorite, it always gives me a smile on my face and in my belly. When dessert time came around I ordered a cappuccino to go with my cheesecake... Again, everyone received their drinks, I waited... And waited till I was able to flag down the waitress to remind them I didn't receive my cappuccino. We finished the cheesecake before my cafe con leche arrived pipping hot, so hot I burned my tongue... Lucky for me I was able to enjoy the cheesecake while I still had taste buds. We informed the waitress that we didn't receive the cappuccinos we ordered but instead cafe con leches, she change our bill & took mine off (I left almost all of it since I didn't want my party waiting for me to finish the cup of lava I was served)"
Dre B.,"Miami, FL",212,294,897,3.0,11/18/2016,"Cheesecake has a huge menu, as you know. Something for everyone.  This particular one i came to around 10pm on a Thursday. place closes at 11pm. The hostess didn't even make eye contact with us while talking and checking her phone. Inside was bit too cold for my linking. The menus were greasy and dirty - with so many pages and so many menus, I would expect they rarely get cleaned - and when they do, it's probably with dirty rags. that part alone disgusted me.  The food was... meh. Cheesecake Factory food. Same ol same ol. Not one of my favorite places. Cf is a cheap-date, at-least-I-know-what-I'm-gettng place.  The cheesecake is good though! Go for that!"
Peter T.,"Sunrise, FL",0,11,6,5.0,2/24/2017,I had the Grilled chicken tostada salad. If was awesome!. It actually has two chicken tostadas under the large bed of greens! . It is delicious and very large. Highly recommend this salad. It has perfect amount of a light and delicious dressing.
Saudia H.,"Miami, FL",31,16,29,1.0,3/16/2017,"The waiter charged my card MORE tip than I had initially put. His service was very sloppy. He was supposed to split the bill between my friend (who paid cash) and I, but instead he ended up charging my card for the entire transaction and took my friends cash as his tip. When we told him about it, he looked clueless and corrected the mistake, but he also gave himself an ADDITIONAL tip on my credit card that I did NOT authorize.  When I called to complain to the manager, he said they would refund my money and another manager would be contacting me. However, I never received that refund and no one has contacted me since. Very very disappointed."
Gigi G.,"Miami, FL",8,125,250,3.0,7/30/2016,"I came last night for my birthday. I rarely go out mostly cause I can be impatient. The wait time, the waiting for a plate, the waiting for the check.  The piña colada was weak, I barely tasted the alcohol. My plate was a cup of angel hair with 6 large shrimps. I was beyond disappointed cause I wanted to bring some home. It had a great taste but I really was hoping the portion would've been enough to take home.  On the bright side on my birthday they had the cheesecakes on half price. The Godiva is super sweet but is awesome with milk (bought it home) I honestly won't be returning. First impression matters."
Serena P.,"Weston, FL",150,122,246,3.0,12/22/2016,"Oh Cheesecake Factory....I haven't really been disappointed by you on prior visits, but today was no good.  My sister and I decided to visit for lunch (normally I go for dinner). I ordered the factory nachos and my sister ordered the orange chicken. My sisters orange chicken was very good-served with veggies and brown rice. Great flavor.  Now, lets talk about the nachos.....when the waiter put the plate in front of me I was hit with a horrible stench of stinky cheese (and I love cheese). The nachos were burnt and the chicken, which costs extra, was sparse. Omg it was bad. I am not the type to turn a plate away but this was so bad I had to call the waiter to please take it away-and FAST!  I asked for a turkey bacon avocado club sandwich instead and was much more satisfied.  By the way their strawberry lemondade is fantastic!"
Rossmari P.,"Miami, FL",159,68,45,5.0,3/2/2017,"I like Cheesecake Factory, the food Is good and you can enjoy a Yumi yumi cheesecake of whatever you want. The place is nice, but not for children I think."
Lynda C.,"Boynton Beach, FL",62,37,104,3.0,5/23/2017,"I used to love this place for their huge selection of good items and prices . It seems that there was something for every taste . And their desserts oh my , oh my cheesecakes and more cheesecakes . Now I must say there food quality and flavor has declined and not just a little . What a shame ! Their service is also questionable , I usually go to the one in Boca and it seems that if you come during Happy Hour  you won't see your server again  after your first drink and apps . I might give it another chance but it's been miss, miss, miss the last three times I have been here . Like I said what a shame I really used to like this place ."
Ana R.,"Hialeah, FL",0,8,,5.0,8/2/2017,"Great good, great service. Love the chicken Madeira and Chicken Picatta I want to try the whole dessert menú lol"
