Meghan M.,"Orlando, FL",209,276,69,4.0,2/14/2012,I am a huge fan of The Cheesecake Factory and I have been to locations all over the country.  This location was smaller than other ones I have been to which did lead to a much louder than normal experience but the food was as always... very good.   If you are looking for a restaurant in which everyone can find something to eat then this is your place (over 10 page menu!)-I recommend the buffalo blasts as an appetizer.  I recommend going for lunch for the lunch portion meals or if you go for dinner split a meal because I promise you that you will not be able to finish your meal. And of course... you can never forget to finish the meal off with cheesecake- I am a fan of the classic cheesecake but I have had several others and they were all good just some too sweet for my taste.
Nadine S.,"White Plains, NY",0,7,,4.0,7/7/2014,"We are from N.Y. But visit  family in Pembroke Pines every 3 months. Went to the Cheesecake Factory and ate there.   The waiter was great, polite and attentive. the 3 dishes we ordered were all very good, and we shared a bit since the dishes are on the generous side. The pricing is good for the value although I find their appetizers somewhat overpriced...overall a very good choice, dependability with their food , very good service and good value for their main dishes. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because of the noise factor which at times can be loud. Our wait that night was only 15 minutes ( for 3 people).  Another night we ordered for take out to eat in our hotel room. The food was very good and they gave us everything we needed for the meal including the breads in the bread basket you get when seated at the table. We were not disappointed in any way. And enjoyed the meal even in our hotel room."
Fab E.,"Davie, FL",145,132,53,4.0,11/25/2013,"If you think when you order you will get a small plate or portion you better ask for  a packaged box before hand. Diet Kill Warning. Delish, but a killer on your diet. Loved the food, will be back once I burn it off.."
Ed B.,"Hollywood, FL",63,63,18,4.0,1/7/2014,Been here like many of you many times.. Pretty consistent every time I visit. Wife and I order some drinks and came our pretty quick and we're very good. I ordered the chicken piccata which was great and my wife ordered pretzel crusted chicken and our waiter wanted to make sure she knew what she was ordering because he did he hadn't had good reviews on it.. I really appreciated his honesty and my wife orders chicken sandwich instead..  She loved it. For dessert we orders the tiramisu which was also good. They get 4 stars because it is really good and not GREAT. Honestly I'm not sure how any big chains could do better...
Mariam D.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",512,389,535,4.0,7/12/2013,"Consistent, good food, perfect portions, and a friendly waitress that gave us all the time we needed to catch up while trying to choose from the menu that is actually a spiral bound book of delicious meals to choose from.  Bread basket of sour dough and sweet wheat.  I had the full portion Carlton salad it was fresh, tasty, and exactly what I was in the mood for during our lunchtime visit. My friend had the creamy Chipotle pasta with vegetables.  We saved room for dessert, and wow, the tiramisu and white chocolate raspberry cheesecake slices were dreamy.  Try the passion fruit iced tea, it's refreshing."
Jasmine J.,"Miramar, FL",21,18,12,4.0,1/12/2014,"I only come here during special occasions... I love their sweet corn tamales, firecracker salmon, bang bang chicken & shrimp, chicken madeira, red velvet cheesecake... Customer service has never been an issue. Due to the popularity of this place, you might end up waiting long; but no biggie for me, Pembroke Gardens is a nice place to do some people-watching."
Jana C.,"Tallahassee, FL",106,117,7,4.0,10/27/2013,Great service! The entree I ordered didn't taste like what it was supposed to so I sent it back and they were happy to fix it. Supposedly they hired new cooks.
Leanna J.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",129,142,16,2.0,6/15/2014,"I hadn't ate at the Cheesecake Factory since I got food poisoning from Grand Luxe a few years ago. The only reason I broke my personal boycott of all Cheesecake Factory owned restaurants is because someone gave my dad a $100 gift card and my family decided Father's Day is a good time to get rid of it. We anticipated having to wait at least an hour because that's just how it is at Cheesecake Factories everywhere. You wait obscenely long periods of time for mediocre food. This location is no exception. My family and I waited for 45 minutes. Their pager doesn't reach outside of the front door area so you're pretty much forced to stay close by. Once they paged us, we were herded like cattle into the front of the restaurant to another waiting space in the path of the waiters. Smart. This is something I've never understood about Cheesecake Factory. They know that at EVERY location they've ever established, that there's a long wait. Why not have a waiting room or a more advanced paging system so that people aren't jam packed into a small area? One of the hostess' was far from friendly too. She clearly did not want to be at work this evening and her eye rolls every time she passed customers made it clear that she didn't care who knew it. Once we got to our table and placed our orders, the food was brought out in a timely manner. The calamari was not very good however. It was pretty much just batter. My mom ordered the skinny salmon dish and she said the salmon was dry. My dad thought his salmon from the regular menu was average. I ordered the skinny lemon shrimp and the shrimp was pretty flavorless. The dish was nothing to remember. All in all, our experience left a lot to be desired. Needless to say, we won't be waiting an hour at this place unless someone forces a Cheesecake Factory gift card upon us again (I pray to the heavens above that they don't)."
M J.,"Hollywood, FL",0,41,,1.0,4/27/2014,"Worst cheesecake factory experience last week. Said to my family, we would never ever go back to this restaurant under any circumstances. Everything came out super spicy. Stuff that never was spicy had spice in it that day. All the food came out just terrible. The service was no where to be found and uninterested. It seems like this location hires some of the worst people for the job.  There was no manager to be found in the restaurant or i would have put up a fight. On top of that, i had stomach pains for a whole day after.  AVOID THIS CHEESECAKE FACTORY AT ALL COSTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
John S.,"Hollywood, FL",29,145,29,1.0,8/30/2011,Went here on a Sunday expecting it to be busy because it was a Sunday afternoon.  We were still suprised to see a line out of the door.  We already decided that we wanted to sit outside and noticed that no one else was sitting outside.  Now confident that we would probably not have to wait we went inside.  The hostess told us that the outdoor seating does not open up until later in the evening.  Their outdoor seating probably makes up 1/4 of all of their available seating.  We were shocked that with all of these people waiting that they wouldn't open more seating/call in additional servers.  We asked her how long the wait was and she said 50 min.  WOW Seems like they don't want to make money.... I'm not the type of person who will wait 50 minutes for ANY meal.  Weird way of doing business.... Won't go back.
Jamie S.,"Miami, FL",371,257,435,4.0,7/20/2013,"I've said it once and I'll say it again, you can't go wrong with Cheesecake Factory. I always sample new items since the menu is so overwhelmingly lengthy. The only constant is the Godiva Cheesecake...of course, until the new S'mores Cheesecake comes out which I heard is soon. Can't wait!"
C L.,"Clearwater, FL",8,54,36,4.0,9/26/2013,"I love the Cheesecake Factory, but I've never reviewed it for some reason.  So I was there again this week for an early dinner with a business associate.  We both got the chicken piccata.  I think this is a dish they do really well ( I think they do all their dishes well). Very thin chicken cutlets are covered with a sauce containing lemons, capers, and mushrooms.  We deduced that the sauce must also contain heavy cream, a little wine possibly, and some butter, among other things.  It's accompanied by a small mound of vermicelli.  What a dish!  It is just sooo good.  I'd be happy with this as a birthday meal, ""a last meal"", or in lieu of a steak dinner.  Simple, tasty, and very filling. I also like to order their passion flower iced tea.  Reminds me of Hawaii and almost makes me feel like I'm eating my chicken piccata on a Maui beach. Ahhhh.  I love the Cheesecake Factory."
Jose B.,"Hialeah, FL",102,93,3,5.0,2/24/2013,I love this place. But it is a bit over priced for the type of food they serve. But it is delicious
Kay S.,"Miami, FL",0,11,3,3.0,10/6/2011,"1 star for the effort  I had been to several Cheesecake Factory restaurants in & out of Florida but this is unbelievably baddd!!! The rice was UNCOOKED!!! How can you serve uncooked rice??!!! My girlfriend & I ordered the same (Crispy Spicy Beef), the beef had heavy batter that you can taste the flour & needless to say, soggy and not crispy! The presentation was horrible, they just scooped the rice & it's all unevenly plated!!! Cheesecake Factory, shame on you!!! Not coming back to this location, that's for sure!!! UPDATE: Decided to give the place another chance, had brunch here & it was pretty good...."
Kazuna A.,"Miami, FL",3,48,17,4.0,10/23/2014,i had best lemon drop martini  in my life at the bar alone  few weeks ago.  after i got ton of makeup at sephora .  i dont know her name but she was pretty nice . the reason i love cheese cake factory is great customer service and avocado spring roll.
Mimi S.,"Fulshear, TX",53,19,,5.0,8/19/2013,We love this location!!! The food is very consistent and the service is great!! I highly recommend this location!  We go every week as a family and we love it.
Sheila C.,"Miami Lakes, FL",155,14,2,4.0,10/1/2012,Love Love Love!!!  Went on Sunday night to the Pembroke Gardens location. No wait.  Ordered the Chicken Enchiladas from the Skinnylicious menu and it was delicious. My daughter picked out the dessert (which is a must there) . This time we shared a Godiva Chocolate Cheescake and boy was it good!!!! Our waiter was excellent and will go back anytime.
Maite R.,"Miami Lakes, FL",237,39,,5.0,5/27/2013,"You can't go wrong, overall, at this place.  Sure, you might get an ok dish here and there, but their menu is so huge that it suits all tastes.  Service is usually very good, as is the bar service.  It is what it is ... a lively, reasonably priced place with lots of options, most of which are great.  This particular location can get a little annoying with its wait time because it's one of the smaller locales, but all in all, they do a good job moving it along, and I personally have never felt rushed."
Arly J.,"Hollywood, FL",25,256,263,3.0,7/3/2013,We enjoy Cheesecake Factory for lunch and dinner but there Breakfast menu and food in the morning is Horrible Our wait staff as well was all over the place forgot half our food and then the food was not even average. I do definatly reccomend there tamale appetizer as well as the sliders and they have plenty of good dishes. And you can't go wrong with there cheesecakes. The place will always be packed and service is hit or miss. We have found the bartendars are always  good .
Louise O.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",2,26,,4.0,3/12/2012,"I love me some cheesecake factory, but this location is very small compared to every other cheesecake factory Ive visited before. Regardless of the size, the experience and the for is what matters. The menu is aways filled with variety. If you're a picky eater, no problem. They have tons of great dishes to choose from.  One of my favorite appetizers to share with a group is the deep fried macaroni and cheese. The servings are always large so it's good to keep in mind that you might want to plan to share with other's before ordering.  Another great thing to look forward to is the bread they bring to the table. They usually bring two different types of bread with butter to hold you over until the food arrives. It's so good, you may even want to ask if you can bring some of it home with you after the meal is over.  As far as the cheese cake goes, I've always been way too stuffed to try any of their dessert. So I can't have any opinion on the specialty cheesecake they have.  Regardless of the size, this cheesecake factory tastes great."
