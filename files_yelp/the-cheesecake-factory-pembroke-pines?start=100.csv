Jessica C.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",169,63,39,3.0,3/23/2015,"In a flash: GREAT, I love their cheesecakes! Kind of overwhelmed with the diverse menu, but food was still good quality. Service definitely fluctuates from the times I've been here.  Top favorite cheesecakes: Red Velvet, 30th Anniversary, Kahlua, Oreo, While chocolate raspberry and banana cream pie.  No matter which Cheesecake factory I go to, the quality of their cheesecakes has always been consistent. Come here for the cheesecakes and get it to-go."
Robert D.,"Hollywood, FL",0,2,,2.0,7/18/2016,"I'll start by saying I love the Cheesecake Factory. The food is delicious and portions are very generous. However this location is very busy and its its own worst enemy. Wanted to have dinner on a Tuesday evening, we called earlier in the day and were told that they don't take reservations. Ok, Tuesday night, not Friday or Saturday, maybe it doesn't get that busy. We got there around 7pm and were told we'd have a 2 hour wait time! No thank you. It's not that good. We ended up getting a slice of cheesecake to go (which still took 10 minutes) and went to another restaurant in the same complex. A restaurant this busy needs to take reservations"
Michelle V.,"Gainesville, FL",100,62,13,4.0,7/2/2015,"One thing I do hate is how I always get too full to even be able to eat any cheesecake! My advice, order dessert first!  This is a great place to go out and celebrate, just be prepared to wait on the weekends."
Jairo S.,"Hialeah, FL",0,1,,5.0,1/2/2017,Fucking awesome dude !!! My waiter was totally the fucking man I think his name was Robert .. great experience will most definitely come again man
Josette L.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",31,70,21,5.0,4/2/2016,"Love this place, been coming for years. Could have sworn I did a review before but whatever. Anyway, this place is ALWAYS busy so be prepared to wait. The food is always on point ! And the cheesecakes are to die for ! I always get the tiramisu every time, can't go wrong. I'm in love with their fresh guac & chips, also their Cesar salad is amazing as well."
Doron S.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",10,24,41,5.0,12/12/2015,"This restaurant is always busy and you have to wait for 30 minutes to dine, but the food is good and the service is exceptionally."
Roman M.,"Hollywood, FL",127,26,2,1.0,1/1/2016,"I understand that this place is extremely busy on a holiday but they are not suited for more than one large party of 10 or more.  And poor communication with girl at desk.  We had reservations at 1pm to celebrate my nieces birthday on Jan 1st for a party of 15. That's the place she wanted to go to celebrate. We were told it would be 15 mins.   After 15 mins past, we were told the manager wanted to speak to us.  It would be an hour more.  After that hour, we were given a pager, sorry it would be another hour. They had a party that just sat down after waiting 1.5 hrs.   Hell no !!!    I called BJs Brewhouse and got a table immediately ready when we got there 15 mins later."
Vanessa V.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",2,27,22,2.0,8/10/2015,Service was ok. As usual.. The place is very loud. It's difficult to have a conversation with the person across from you. Food wasn't bad but wasn't great either. My shrimp in the lemon and Garlic skinny pasta were very overlooked. My husband had the Asian salad and the chicken was missing. There were maybe three thin slices of chicken.. Deli chicken.
Mirielle C.,"Balboa Park, San Diego, CA",83,104,82,4.0,6/29/2015,"We came after church on Sunday and I was elated that they had brunch!! It was good, I had the crab hash. It was just good though. My bf and his mom got the eggs Benedict and they said they would have liked if the eggs were a little runnier bc otherwise the dish was a bit dry. My mom got the Baja Chicken brunch option, and it was good. Their mint tea was so refreshing. Our waiter was super attentive and kept bringing me refills.  I've been here two other times and always think it's good but never understand why they are always so packed. I loved the Oreo cheesecake, a definite must try! Overall everything was good. It's worth checking out but there's always a wait so if you're really hungry, you're better off hitting up Fuddruckers or something else."
Erick G.,"Opa-locka, FL",127,4,,5.0,3/4/2016,Melanie and Nicole were awesome! All smiles and great customer service! I really enjoy this location and will definitely return.
Tamer K.,"Miramar, FL",0,2,6,4.0,4/13/2014,"Place always busy, Great food light on the wallet 4 ppl with drinks 140$ bucks. I love the Classic burger and a mojito to go with it.  You Won't be disappointed.."
Jay D.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",38,33,112,5.0,12/21/2014,I enjoy dining at this Cheesecake Factory after church for Sunday breakfast. The service is really good and the food is great. My son enjoys the blueberry pancakes. My daughter enjoys the pasta and I'm always switching it up. Everything is always on point and the Manager is really cool!
Dara B.,"Sunrise, FL",118,395,398,5.0,1/21/2015,"Besides the scrumptious, oh so delicious cheesecakes,   the food is tasty and the service is awesome."
Kristia B.,"Brooklyn, NY",209,502,139,4.0,6/19/2012,"After hearing rave reviews of The Cheesecake Factory, this New York native finally got to taste and see what everyone has been crazy about. Too bad, I had to go all the way to Florida to make this visit happen. I hate the pages and pages of menu items. As a first-timer, it took way too long for me to browse and decide. I mean, really? If your menu is not between 2-4 pages then we have a problem. Then again, I guess it is a ""factory"" right, but not just for cheesecake.  The bread was yummy. I ordered the island grilled chicken which was delicious. When it comes to grilled meat, you usually run the risk of winding up getting served a piece of meat that is dry. Luckily, the kitchen staff know what they're doing, because my chicken was still moist and flavorful. As a Caribbean, I wasn't too happy with the small spoon of brown rice on my plate. However, they do tell you what to expect in the description. We were stuffed. Since we arrived just an hour before closing time, there was no room or time for dessert. The prices were reasonable too. The decor in the restaurant and the bathroom were divine. It's a great place to dine and host events. Very elegant and classy. I will definitely be back for more."
Senen J.,"Miami, FL",1,26,153,5.0,7/8/2015,"Great for ""HAPPY HOUR"" Strawberry Martini / Tuna Tartar and Crab Bites ! Get in early to beat the dinner crowd."
Yari R.,"Miami, FL",5,22,7,3.0,3/17/2016,"Our server was great!!! But the floor was rather slippery and hard to walk and the entrees came out too soon while we were still having the appetizers. The food as usual delicious, but we have to work on the timing and the floor is an accident waiting to happen"
Destinee S.,"Hollywood, FL",4,48,78,5.0,5/15/2015,"Everyone knows the Cheesecake Factory is where it's at! Amazing!! The cheesecakes, even better!! However, because it's always so packed, the wait sucks and the service isn't that great since the waiters aren't very attentive. If they up the service, it'd be perfect"
Emily P.,"Hollywood, FL",1,11,3,3.0,10/21/2016,"I came here for my birthday and the food was ""eh"". I had the enchiladas. They tasted a little better than Chili's but I paid TWICE as much. The rice was crunchy and the black beans were not good at all. I will not be going back here anytime soon. $100 for a family dinner that was ""just okay"" feels like a waste of money to me. Such a disappointment. Spend your hard earned money elsewhere. The only reason they got the 3rd star was because our server was very polite and attentive."
Lauren C.,"Zirconia, NC",65,27,,5.0,5/26/2016,Tremendous. Outstanding. Delectable. Chicken Marsala...thai lettuce wraps...and Smores cheesecake...maybe some strawberry lemonade too. Never disappoints. Go early because it gets packed but for GOOD reason.
Yadie T.,"Doral, FL",11,8,2,1.0,3/27/2016,"Got to restaurant at 1250. Told us wait was 20. Waiting 45. Sat down, 20 minutes to get water and bread. Gave us a bogus story about the decaf coffee. Ordered two waffles to make it easier. 40 minutes later nothing. Walked out. Get your customer service better people. Extremely upset pregnant women. Never coming back! Always the same thing with this place. Ridiculous. Either hire more staff or stop trying to over pack your restaurant. Clientele is far more important than the green. Greedy!"
