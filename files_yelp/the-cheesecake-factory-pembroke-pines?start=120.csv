Lorraine G.,"Hollywood, FL",0,6,,1.0,5/1/2016,"The food was delicious! The service was terrible. We sat outside (it's so nice out). Our waitress was HORRIBLE. Her ""friend"" also sat outside l and most of the waitress's attention was on the friend.  She never introduced herself, messed up the food order, and drop the check on the table as if she wanted to be fired. Her and her friend talked it up as if they were on the beach. The server ate from her friends plate and held chunks of food in her mouth. Professionalism is no longer required to work at Cheesecake Factory at The Shops. Go for the food."
Ms. K.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",1,31,39,3.0,7/2/2015,"It's hit or miss, sometimes it's great other times it's okay. I had the sante fe chicken salad it was okay. The waitress was friendly."
Alex R.,"Tamarac, FL",44,31,,4.0,3/13/2016,"If you are willing to wait - and I mean wait - then this place is perfect. Great food, in the middle of a great shopping strip, and very friendly service. But, you will be here for hours."
Dariana M.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",149,2,1,3.0,10/9/2015,I'm only giving this 3 stars because my food was amazing but I wish I could say the same about my server .. He made me feel rushed and gave horrible service. Not to mention when my pasta came he never asked if I wanted cheese on top
Chris H.,"Boca Raton, FL",0,8,1,2.0,10/15/2016,Hey Cheesecake Factory!!!!! There are a lot of restaurants around you. First impressions matter. Make sure you hosts/hostesses welcome customers. Don't make us feel like we're bothering yo
Private Matter B.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",1,64,42,2.0,2/2/2016,The avocado rolls are usually sure to please. They were sour tasting and not quite what I remember. The flatware was dirty with spots and fingerprints the 2 paper napkins I received had something gooey on them. On the upside I won't get fat being tempted to eat here again.
Guillermo H.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",0,8,4,1.0,2/25/2016,Very disappointing experience at the Cheese Cake Factory last month. We saw a live roach roaming on top of our table and on the wall next to our booth. The manager acted like nothing happened. Won't come back.
Tee C.,"Miramar, FL",18,30,38,1.0,7/27/2014,"Shitty place almost slipped and fell twice when I walked in! Told the hostess who said ""oh sorry I know"" what' the hell ?! Then when we were seated at our booth there were flies at the table from the dirty table next to ours. Disgusting! The utensils were on the table and didn't looked washed. As we were walking out the floor was Slippery (no surprise) told our waitress Jamie who didn't seem to care that anybody can slip and get hurt.  Should've gotten up and left and when we got up to leave had to hold on to each other and walk out. I don't know why we even stayed. I'm pissed and the cheesecake even though it was delicious couldn't even make up for it. Aventura location does not disappoint from what I can remember."
Lynette T.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",0,31,8,3.0,1/27/2016,"I really like CF but this one is always so packed. The one thing I really like is that the service is always good, which I really appreciate. Overall I would say that its a good food option and always get good food."
Josie W.,"Hollywood, FL",3,97,,2.0,5/3/2016,"This was our first visit to a Cheesecake Factory. We are big fans of ""The Big Bang Theory"" tv show so were excited to finally make it here. It was a Friday night so, as expected, it was loud and crowded. Our wait was only 20 minutes which wasn't too bad. The menu has a lot of items. I must say that the service was quite slow. Our server was very friendly but everything, including our water, took a very long time to reach us and we only got one type of bread because apparently they hadn't baked any more. Of course every item we asked about, we were told was terrific.  Everyone in my group was less than excited about our dishes. The taste was plain and not well seasoned and for what we ordered was very overpriced in my opinion. I've had better in local diners. The only saving grace for this place is because all the desserts we ordered were fantastic. I ordered a Strawberry Shortcake which was huge and very good. I guess they should have just stuck to desserts. I will probably not return as it was a disappointment."
Natalie G.,"Hollywood, FL",4,32,2,4.0,10/4/2015,"Love cheesecake fac, can't go wrong if your undecided, it's the go to place.  Even on vacation somewhere, don't know where to dine,  eat the cheese! Love the bread, love the apps, really good fish and chips actually."
JC T.,"Miami, FL",50,77,57,5.0,8/21/2015,"What can I say, this place rocks.  Thy serve from salads, to pizzas and filet mignon.  Great for big parties with a variety of items in their menu"
Sonia P.,"Miami Gardens, FL",61,103,148,4.0,7/20/2015,"I've been compelled lately to give a few restaurants a second chance that have had a most unfavorable review in the past.  After my experience today...the first thought that came to my mind was ""YES!  Now THAT'S the Cheesecake Factory that I remember!""  Wow!  What a difference!  My review is based on an experience on a Monday around 11:30 A.M.  My waiter was great!  He made sure that we not only had a good experience, but he also gave good suggestions.  It was a VERY HOT day and I wanted something frozen, lite, and sweet.  He recommended that I try the Mango Smoothie. I had no idea that Cheesecake Factory made smoothies.  The smoothie was perfection in a glass.  I could not stop talking about that smoothie.  It was everything that I wanted and so much more.  I had the avocado egg rolls for an appetizer.  They were fresh, well prepared, and creamy. Loved them!  I ordered the chicken piccata as my main meal.  It was really good.  I'm not sure if this location is under new management or if they have a new cook...but it was SO MUCH better this time around."
Jen C.,"Pompano Beach, FL",13,32,33,2.0,10/21/2015,"Came here tonight before s movie , we come here at least once a month. But tonight the service was a bit off. We had the same waiter as last time we were here figure to give him a second chance. He's not very attentive and he always seems very rushed when it not even that busy. I ordered my usual garlic noodles with chicken. Tonight it came out with bite size pieces of chicken rather then the usual chicken on the bone. So I sent it back, waited about ten minutes later for it to be made, brought it to me with no apology, no discount nor checked on me after that. An apology would have been nice but he totally disregarded the situation. Other then that the food is always good here so we come back, just next time I hope I don't get him again. Everybody knows the food is good here and prices are a it pricey but the food is so worth it. The chicken potstickers are also amazing."
Kevin O.,"Key West, FL",1,55,7,2.0,2/5/2016,Disappointing meal. My wife ordered a burger very well done and it came out pink and cold. My daughter ordered tacos and they came out cold as well. Used to love coming here but not anymore.
Glenn P.,"Miami Gardens, FL",4,34,31,4.0,8/29/2015,"This place is one of my favorite restaurants to eat at. They have a very large menu and each item I get is very satisfying. I recently went there on the first day of school as I usually go somewhere every first day of school. My daughter Kayla loves their spaghetti and meatballs!!! My wife enjoys different appetizers which usually gets her very full. I always start out with a green mint tea which is soothing. I choose from the Fish and Chips, Cheeseburger, or one of my favorites Chicken Picatta.  I always try to save room for one of my favorite cheesecakes the vanilla bean!!!!!! That's one good cheesecake especially with a cup of coffee. My family and I enjoyed the meal,and will mist definitely be back. I remember when they first opened up in Pembroke Pines back in 2011.  The food continues to be great and the service continues to be top notched. I look forward to coming back to Cheesecake Factory to try another delicious item."
Mandi S.,"Hollywood, FL",0,1,6,5.0,2/14/2016,"The wait for pretty long but it was the day before valentine's day. They it said over an hour but it was less :) we sat at the bar and had a drank while we waited and it was nice. I got the steak and salmon combo, it was a good enough portion to have leftovers, too. MELVIN was our waiter and he was really nice and made sure we had everything we needed.  It was a good experience. I love cheesecake factory!!!"
Lissette C.,"Miami Lakes, FL",36,40,2,4.0,7/1/2014,"Food is delicious and never a disappointment. I recommend the factory burger, Cajun chicken littles, or the steak medallions from the skinny menu.  For appetizer you must try the avocado egg rolls or hummus :)  I've honestly never tried a dessert I didn't like here!  Took off a star because service is always lacking."
Ernesto M.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",167,117,62,3.0,8/23/2014,"In reviewing the Cheesecake Factory, what can I say that hasn't been said by anyone else in the world?  I almost got it.... nope can't do it!  This chain restaurant delivers good food. There isn't anyone that can argue with that. The menu is massive and they give their customers the opportunity to choose what they would like to indulge in.  Like one of my fellow yelper stated in her review, other than there phenomenal cheesecakes the food isn't enough to make you come back. But I find it so interesting that everyone comes to celebrate something here. It has to be the dessert menu!"
JAnthony P.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",2,14,6,5.0,4/30/2014,"Ive been to many cheese cake factory reasturant locations.  This one has always been tge best in wait staff, freshness of food, and preparation.  The patio can be a bit sunny at the end of the day, and tgeres a tendency for pigeons.  I had the Farfalle with chicken and garlic. Its the best pasta dish on the menu!"
