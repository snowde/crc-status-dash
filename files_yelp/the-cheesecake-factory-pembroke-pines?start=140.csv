Debra C.,"Fresno, CA",180,141,74,4.0,4/30/2014,"It's The Cheesecake Factory...you should know what to expect.  I got the Fresh Vegetable Salad with Chicken, and it was exactly what a expected.  It had a good mix of atypical salad vegetables with pomegranate salad dressing.  The service was good, and I have no complaints about this place.  I would definitely get this salad again.  The serving size was perfect and it's only $13 dollars with the chicken.  It's a good lunch time meal before or after a day of shopping."
Davarius J.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",0,17,3,5.0,1/17/2016,"A bit of a wait on a busy night, but well worth it. Friendly waiters and great service. The appetizers are phenomenal, I recommend the pot stickers, avocado eggrolls, and fried mac and cheese balls. Even though they brought us one of the wrong appetizers, the waiter was extremely apologetic. The waiter kept apologizing after the food took 15 minutes, which isn't even that long compared to other restaurants on a busy night. The manager also personally came to our table to check on my wife and me. The salads and burgers are always great. The menu is so long it should be renamed the Food Bible. And of course, the Oreo Cheesecake is mouth-watering! Overall great food, phenomenal service, and a classic American restaurant."
Nicole A.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",0,12,,1.0,3/11/2015,"Went and had dinner here... I have eaten at other Cheesecake factories before and have never received the sub-quality food that was provided at this restaurant. I ordered the teriyaki chicken & the rice was cold & hard... Literally... I could not cut through the white rice with my knife.... After complaining to the waiter, she brought me some ""fresh"" white rice... However, sadly to say it must have come from the exact same batch.  I was extremely disappointed & will not be visiting there again... At least not for anything other than the desserts which were good."
Patty A.,"Miami Lakes, FL",8,32,35,4.0,5/20/2015,I love coming to Cheesecake Factory - it just never gets old for me.  My favorite entree to order here is the Pasta da Vinci. The portion sizes are very big so you can share and still get pretty full. Last time I ordered the Sheila's salad lunch portion and it was delicious. This is a great place for lunch or dinner.
Benny S.,"Hollywood, FL",57,35,39,5.0,7/25/2014,Steak Coulette with Sweet Potato fries... Great seasoning and good size portion for a healthy meal. Good customer in a great location were parking can be challenge but at least you don't have to pay for it.
Lissa L.,"Miramar, FL",0,3,,2.0,7/4/2016,"I visited here this past weekend with my family for a Birthday dinner and the service was horrible! The wait time for our group was over two hours long. After placing our orders, our food took another 45 minutes to come out. I ordered pasta and it was cold and the noodles were clumped together. One of our servers had a horrible attitude and became upset because we didn't like the service he was providing. Absolutely disgusting I wouldn't recommend anyone to visit this location."
Jeisy C.,"Hollywood, FL",2,13,24,4.0,11/5/2014,"I love their menu, the cheesecakes are amazing (pumpkin pecan is awesome)  I usually go for pasta dishes, absolutely love the chicken romano pasta.  The bread is really good, my favorite is the brown.  The only drawback with this place is that it usually has a long wait time and they don't accept reservations.  However, at this particular location I always end up visiting the near by stores while I wait and this makes time fly by.  Overall have had a good experience at this location."
Jenny C.,"Hollywood, FL",2,7,,5.0,4/14/2014,"Love coming here, the food is always good. Great service. Nice place and really nice ambiance. The only thing is the wait is pretty long but once the food comes, its definitely worth the wait. Everything on the menu is amazing. My favorite thing to order are the chicken pot stickers"
Janett B.,"Hollywood, FL",51,6,1,1.0,5/3/2015,"Bad service and experience. At this location parking is bad, the wait for a table was over an hour. After we were seated waiter shows up after 20 to 30 minutes. We placed our order, the appetizers were wrong and the main meal was wrong and cold. Plates were returned twice for both couples. Waiter would disappear 30 minutes or more. Food took for ever to reach our table. We arrived at 3:30 PM and we finally got our check at 6:20 PM. WILL NEVER GO TO THIS FACTORY. I give this location a ONE because there's no ZERO."
Luis Cláudio M.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",98,5,1,1.0,9/7/2015,"If you want to wait a lot and be treated poorly. Come to this restaurant. I've been in other Cheescake Factory and all are good, but this is horrible service."
Kat R.,"Hollywood, FL",5,13,27,1.0,2/8/2015,"Very bad service, how they can said they do not have bread to serve, and food took more than 30 minutes to come. We just decide to leave and eat in other place. Very disappointed!"
Agustin M.,"New Windsor, NY",4,12,3,5.0,6/23/2015,Great portions of food and everything is made fresh. I highly recommend the Thai Lettuce Wraps!!!
Ana S.,"Ocala, FL",7,19,12,5.0,6/23/2015,"Thai lettuce wraps are to die for!!! Oh, and the stuffed chicken tortillas as well!! The plates are huge, so I always share"
Shellie D.,"Alexandria, VA",46,579,167,4.0,6/17/2012,"I love the Cheesecake Factory... It's pretty consistent every where you go. Went here for a graduation dinner with a party of 10. It took about 2 hours to be seated so we walked around the mall. If you know you're going to have a large party, be sure to come two hours in advance to get your name on the list. The kids menu is pretty large but only has one healthy option. If you are trying to watch your weight or eat healthier, the Skinny Menu is amazing."
Dana S.,"Miami, FL",0,11,,2.0,3/31/2016,Flys all over the place and mostly seen flying around and landed on glass wall between kitchen and dining area. Extremely warm dining space. Looonf wait and poor service. Ugh
Andres R.,"Miami, FL",43,55,4,4.0,10/17/2013,"Great service! Great food! I am alwayas amazed at how you can eat at different cheesecake factory restaurants and if you order the same plate, they will be almost identically. This one is very spacious, it gets crowded, but only on weekend nights, abd it has tables inside and outside. The shopping center is very nice also.  I always try a new plate, this time I tried the skinnylicious three soft chicken tacos, if you're not too hungry is an excellent choice, they are great and are a healthy option.  As always the food is excellent, the portions are huge, the prices are great, and the service is fast and friendly.  Recommended!"
Margaret C.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,20,18,4.0,7/21/2015,"The shops at Pembroke Gardens. Great food! We were there for my mom n dads anniversary and ours. It was quite late so we simply went for some quick appetizers-we had vietnamese shrimp and avocado  rolls. Great!  Also had original cheese cake,  carrot cake cheesescake n capuchinos. We have been there many times. Great service n great staff! Jessie was very friendly n took some pics for us. Great job!  Thank u.  Keep it up!  Maggie."
Joe M.,"Hialeah, FL",3,10,10,3.0,4/19/2015,Sat down the waiter asked us what we wanted to drink and never brought the bread also I ordered chicken Alfredo and got shrimp Alfredo twice and gave us mean look
Josephine F.,"Beverly Hills, Los Angeles, CA",10,11,18,5.0,3/23/2015,"Love the shrimp and chicken gumbo! Must try the newest cheesecake flavor, Lemon Meringue! My new favorite!"
Vishal P.,"Atlantic City, NJ",158,154,3,4.0,12/20/2013,"If you're trying to come here for a fast business lunch - make sure you tell your server so they can rush the orders... it doesn't hurt if your party already knows what they want too. This place is in a busy strip mall and it can get packed fast. This Cheesecake Factory isn't anything different than any other one. Good food, good drinks, good service. Can't really say anything bad about this place."
