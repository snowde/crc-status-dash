Vanessa O.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",0,3,,5.0,4/12/2016,I already love cheesecake but everytime I come to this location I'm extra happy. I believe my servers name was Stephanie? She was amazing! Thanks for an amazing time :)
Mark N.,"Miami, FL",6,59,1,5.0,4/26/2015,"A standard Cheesecake factory. You can never go wrong with the food. I tried the chipotle pasta for the very first time and loved it, the waiter made a great recommendation. One of my friends at the table had to wait a long time for her food but the manager came out to apologize and comp'ed the item. That right there is a great example of service recovery. Other locations should take note of that. We would never complain for an issue like this but she went above and beyond to do something she didn't have to. We came at 10 PM on a Sunday night, one hour before closing. At no point did we feel rushed and our server was excellent."
Lazaro P.,"Miami Lakes, FL",77,38,119,5.0,4/12/2013,What can I say this place is still pretty damn good despite being a big chain. ask for daniel W waiter his great. try the shrimp scampi/ steak diane AMAZING best dish on the menu
Enid V.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",65,36,39,5.0,10/9/2013,"Cheesecake Factory never disappoints! Their menu can be overwhelming but there is something for everyone! Light plates are my Fav ESP the lettuce wraps (a healthy option). Kids corn dogs are a hit for the little ones and plenty other options for them.  Expect to wait at any time of day it is always busy but they have call ahead! Consistency is the name with this chain restaurant. The food, atmosphere, drinks and of course desserts are a delight. If you haven't been here at least once do yourself a favor and stop in for a drink and bite you won't be disappointed (remember this place is busy almost all the time so plan accordingly)."
Vero D.,"Miami, FL",26,60,11,5.0,1/11/2013,"You can never go wrong with the Cheesecake Factory! Talk about not knowing what to chose, a million and 1 things on the menu it feels like. Any cheesecake factory is always crazy packed but always for a reason, this place is good stuff. Service is always quick and everyone is nice, especially my Server Michael! What a sweet guy! I love lemon drop Martinis and they always make a yummy one, happy hour is good stuff too! What I love the most is the Skinny menu, they actually have a whole menu dedicated to low calorie low fat meals, that is my all time favorite thins about the cheesecake factory! Overall this place is great food is good service is good and location is great! Shop for a bit and eat eat eat!  P.S  My favorite thing on the appetizers is corn fritters TO DIE FOR!"
Cristina W.,"Hollywood, FL",594,262,206,4.0,8/6/2013,"Love the cheesecake selection! ....and that's about it.  If it wasn't for the cheesecakes, this would just be another rundown restaurant. The food selection is diverse, but most of the food lacks flavor. The prices are pretty high and the portions are just alright.  I like coming here, as the ambience is gorgeous and the servers are pretty nice. Other than that, it's just ok."
Nancy P.,"Hollywood, FL",5,31,16,1.0,8/3/2014,"I came with a party of 10 for a surprise dinner for my friend. We got here at 4:10 and said it would be at 5 and were told they don't take reservations, but it would be 45-50 minutes so it would perfect. They called at 4:40 and we were walking in from the parking lot. By the time we got inside they gave our table away and were told we had to wait another hour to an hour and a half even though we said we were walking in. The manager, kelly, was extremely rude. She would not accommodate us. One of the hostess, Christine, was super nice and tried her best to accommodate us. If it wasn't for her we would have left. As for Kelly, she was unprofessional and ride and should not be manager."
Richard W.,"Miami, FL",429,179,472,4.0,5/1/2013,I always enjoy their pasta and appetizers. My favorite is Red Velvet Cheesecake. Great service.
Mario D.,"Hialeah, FL",0,5,1,4.0,4/12/2015,Good place to eat. The fish tacos are great and so is the red velvet cheesecake. Great place to eat.
Debbie M.,"Hollywood, FL",4,25,47,2.0,7/31/2014,"Extremely disappointed. We came here on half price cheesecake night because we love their cheesecake. We were (surprisingly) seated right away but soon realized that it was because, contrary to their ""half price cheesecake"" rules, you really didn't need to dine in to get the deal. There was a long line of people at the cheesecake counter throughout the duration of our meal.  When it came time for us to order our cheesecake from our waitress (who was very nice), they apparently sent her to the back of the line of about 40 or so people waiting to get it. After about 15 minutes she came back and apologized for the delay, citing how busy they were. Then, when the cheesecake finally arrived, it was about half the size of the cheesecake we are usually served in this restaurant. Now I understand half price cheesecake day. I guess you get what you pay for."
suzanne H.,"Hollywood, FL",34,35,4,5.0,7/4/2013,"I have a special love for Cheesecake Factory!   Good food, great atmosphere for a girl's lunch, birthday celebration, a date night...just about anything Cheesecake fits the bill!"
Allison R.,"Hollywood, FL",95,19,,1.0,2/11/2016,I had two bites of my meal and it was so bad. This is my last time trying this location. I never had a good experience here.
Paula M.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,2,,1.0,4/6/2015,"This location is by far the worst that I have ever been to!  My boyfriend and I brought his mom and sister here to celebrate his sister's birthday and it was completely ruined by the horrible service and the terrible attitude of the manager!  Not only was my boyfriends sister harassed by the manger about her service dog, but we waited for over an hour for our food!  When it finally arrived, it wasn't even right and we were all so upset that we couldn't even eat!  There are several other restaurants in this plaza and I highly recommend trying any of them over this place!!  I've already written a much longer and more detailed letter to the corporate offices, but felt it necessary to warn the public as well!!"
Elizabeth P.,"Miami Lakes, FL",293,224,287,4.0,9/26/2012,"Excellent service and wait staff.  Had  the seared tuna tataki salad and glass of chardonnay.  Of course, had to splurge with a yummy mango key lime cheesecake."
Andrea G.,"Hollywood, FL",7,50,2,5.0,11/23/2014,Always satisfied with the customer service and the food! My friends and I were more than happy enjoying our Thursday night here!
PJ D.,"San Diego County, CA",2,4,1,1.0,9/28/2014,"I normally love the Cheesecake Factory, but this particular one has severely lacking service. The first thing we noticed when we first sat down was that about a third of the silverware and plates on our table had food stuck to them. Our waitress would constantly speed past our table and pretend to not see us when we tried to get her attention. I had to wait over 20 minutes for a refill on my drink. We had to wave down other servers when we needed anything. We are currently waiting for the waitress to come back to get the check. It's been over 15 minutes. We are seriously considering walking out."
Orlando C.,"Hollywood, FL",0,17,6,1.0,2/25/2015,"Extra $2 for ham instead of turkey really...""sorry this is the last time we can do this"" the manager said...so for all you that like club sandwiches go somewhere else"
Larissa A.,"Hollywood, FL",0,5,,2.0,10/27/2015,"Ordered my usual Seared tuna salad. It wasn't the same tuna I always get. Thinly sliced, not seared on the outside. And when pointing it out to our waitress, she told me it was just the way the new chef cut it. Didn't feel like sending my food back, or making a scene out of it. But when paying $19.00 for a salad at cheesecake, you would expect to get what you ordered. Waitress wasn't very nice either. Just a disappointing night.."
Christy P.,"Miami, FL",201,296,86,4.0,1/6/2012,"I pride myself in saying that I try to stay away from big-box restaurants .. and instead challenge myself to find places that are a bit more unique or that I haven't tried yet. But there's something about The Cheesecake Factory that's comforting...in a stuff-your-face-with-4,000 calories-kind-of-way. It's really hard to find a place to grab a late (post-10pm) dinner in the Miramar/Pembroke Pines area.  The first time I tried that... the restaurant we ended up at had run out of most of the food, and served us cold dishes.  So it was back to square one.  We ended up at Cheesecake because out of 3 restaurants we checked in the Pembroke Gardens shopping area... it had the shortest wait.  Sorry, but it's the truth. So glad it worked out that way.  Our big group could have a conversation (as opposed to the loud-as-a-nightclub RA sushi), and we didn't have to wait over an hour (like at The Pub).  We had a great server... who kept really good tabs on all of our drink orders (and 2nd rounds).   We gorged on the fried mac-and-cheese balls (!!!!), avocado eggrolls and all sorts of main dishes. I will end it by saying that no matter what time of day it is, or what diet I'm on... I will always order a Peach Bellini with my meal at Cheesecake.   Trust me on this one."
Raul V.,"Hollywood, FL",0,6,2,1.0,3/16/2015,"My wife,daughter and Grandauter took me to dinner for my birthday on 3-9-2015. We were seated at the first booth on the left side of the entrance, right hsnd side, on the other side is the kitchen. The service was good, food was ok, but unfortunately my wife, who sat by the wall side of yhe booth, was surprised  by a ROACH, about an inch big! I did not wanted to ruin the evening  by creating a scandal, nor did anyone  in my family. It was my birthday. We gave the roach to the waitress. The assistant  manager came and offered us a free  dessert and we declined as wr had a birthday  cake  at home waiting.  An apology was offered by him but nothing else more, like this was a small problem, an everyday  occurrence.  To this day we fell dissapointed by the whole  experience  and vowed never to return,  left me wondering, us being  so close to the kitchen, if the roach came from the kitchen and if the food had contamination,  bad dreams  later, regreted eating the food."
