Nancy C.,"Hialeah, FL",74,25,15,2.0,7/14/2015,"Never have I had such a bad experience like the one I had tonight. The night started with a friends birthday celebration party of 15. After waiting about and hour and a half, they sat a bigger party down before us when we had been there at least 30 min prior to them.  The bread that was put in our table was hard as a rock and not the least edible. Our drinks took about 20 min to order and then again another 20 min to order food. After a an hour and thirty min of waiting for food 5 dishes were returned as the pasta was hard. The manager was called and all the plates were returned to the kitchen, no more than 10 min later ""Newly cooked"" plates were brought out in hopes of fixing the error. All plates were returned  (Again) as the pasta was still hard and stale. By this point most of the party was done eating and 5 of us were out of dinner. When the manager came back to ""fix"" the problem, my husband ordered a Steak Diane to go. Desserts orders were taken and brought out and the steak was still no where to be found. Turns out it was forgotten about and had been sitting out for a while. Steak was over cooked and not to what was ordered. The manager did do his best and took care of our bill but still didn't make up for our experience (hence the two stars.)"
Monica C.,"Miami, FL",179,216,92,3.0,10/27/2011,"I am not a cheesecake factory fan. However, in my side of the world there isn't much to eat.  Being that it is a new place the hubby and I decided to give it a try. The first time I went, we got there as they were opening so we didn't have to wait long.  I was impressed to know that they know have a 500 calories or less menu AND the food on this menu was actually good. However, I tried going again this past Sunday and the wait was 60-70 minutes.  REALLY?  On a Sunday at 3:00 pm?  Needless to say I did not wait.  This place better get it together with their wait times!!"
Trina S.,"West Palm Beach, FL",257,109,61,4.0,6/1/2014,Had our anniversary brunch and it great . It was called the brunch combo served by Juan. He was very professional & attentive. highly recommend the pancakes. The space is. If ever you are in Penbrook Pines I strongly recommend you check them out
Josie H.,"Hialeah, FL",1,7,2,4.0,3/16/2014,"Sandra J was exceptional! Cheesecake Factory in General is usually such a hassle because too many people dine there, but the service I received with Sandra made my wait worth while. I ordered the Tuscan chicken, my mom ordered the Louisiana pasta and we had the guacamole appetizer! Food was perfect. I'm definitely coming back!"
Ivette R.,"Miami, FL",268,1047,251,5.0,10/7/2014,Wow I'm glad they built a Cheesecake Factory in The Pembroke Gardens Mall because that's one of the restaurants Pembroke Pines didn't have.It used to be a humongous Gymboree store the size of a Cheesecake Factory.This location tends to get really busy during lunch hours but it's worth the 45 minute wait.This location is nicer and cleaner than the one in Coconut Grove.Our Waitress was nice I wish I could remember her name.My Strawberry Cheesecake was delicious and so was my Burger yummy I will come back to this particular location yelpers u should go
Celine C.,"Oviedo, FL",115,196,42,4.0,7/26/2012,"Cheesecake Factory never fails me!  I came here on a Wednesday afternoon and sat at the bar.  Our waitress/bartender Marissa was awesome!  She had a fantastic smile on her the whole entire time.  She was quick to everything.  The service was superb!   I ordered the Miso Salmon lunch portion, but I swear it's a dinner portion. The salmon was cooked PERFECTLY!  I love love love the sauce with the salmon and the brown rice.  One thing I didn't like was the snow peas.  They didn't cut the top and the bottom of the snow peas.   I thought that was strange because I had to do it myself.   If you are on a diet, Cheesecake Factory has a skinny menu for healthy conscious people!"
Antwan E.,"Miami, FL",42,26,39,4.0,12/17/2011,"Had lunch here with co-workers for our Secret Santa gift exchange. No matter which location I visit, they never disappoint. We numbered over 20 and they were able to accommodate us without a problem. The waitress was friendly, patient and pleasant. Enjoyed the original burger with jack cheese and fries...simple, traditional but delish!"
Diana N.,"Hollywood, FL",29,41,,3.0,7/29/2014,"The places is always packed so be prepared to wait. Once inside the place is nice, as is every other Cheesecake Factory. The menu has alot of choices and the food is pretty good. Yummy cheesecake of course!"
Emilia L.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",12,10,10,4.0,2/15/2014,"Service is great and everybody nice but is not like it used to be, I'm no sure if they changed owner or what is it but the food was better before, cakes are still great"
Paola L.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,9,2,1.0,7/24/2014,"Had my family with me and my in laws from out of town, how disappointed that the manager in charge decided to close off the outside area with an hour and half left to closing time. We just wanted to have cheesecake and coffee since my in laws were from out of town and had never been. How disappointing, it wasn't even a busy night. No efforts to be accommodating, at least it felt that way.  Very embarrassing for my husband and I."
Adam C.,"Hollywood, FL",70,63,237,1.0,9/5/2011,"This is the newest Cheesecake Factory in South Florida - considerably smaller as it is located in Pembroke Gardens strip mall. The place in WAYYYY TOOO SMALL to have such a big chain there as the parking is a total nightmare. Nevertheles - we were excited to go to the barbi-doll sized Cheesecake Factory. Wow, wow, wow is all I can say. One would think that in such a successful chain - they might have some sort or pre-grand opening training in place? ""DING-DING-DING"" - ""Wrong answer Johnny..."" So being completely fair here (as ALWAYS)... it was friggen pouring for hours - so the hour long wait OUTSIDE was understandable. It was the chaos and hour plus long wait for the food that we are going to simply rip apart... So this time it was me, my lovely wife, and kids. (2 boys & 2 girls - the youngest is only 8 months). If you are a parent reading this - you will feel my pain of a 2 hour wait to finally get us all fed!  The waitress - looked like she just stepped out of an MTV video from the 80's with all kinds of bracelets and chachkas all over her wearing this neon pink lipstick and had strange murderous eyebrows highlighted by the gothic black eye shadow... Now for the fun part.. the sodas were all FLAT - the service continued to underwhelm us as it just took so long. I ordered soup and a well done English muffin (which never came). Also in her description of the soup she never said cold chopped tomatoes or soggy red peppers strewn about as a garnish. So the soup had cold dry chicken just thrown in as well as the artichoke hearts tasted mealy and certainly inedible... (SENT IT BACK) - still no English muffin - never mentioned again except for being charged for it (MY FAVORITE)... My 5 year old's pizza arrived to the table late with a wonderful green slime around the part that was placed right in front of her, which she spots in an instant... The waitress says - ""oh that's only guacamole from another dish she had carried"" - but was not from our table (NICE). So that went back - and it took forever and a week to get her pizza out again - by that time we were all ready to leave. This time the pizza arrives partially underdone - and it has thin spots on it - you can't pick up half the pie... (AWESOME)... To be fair the Chicken Romano was enjoyed by my 13 year old son - $16.50 but the red potatoes were cold and not really appetizing for anyone.  My wife's club sandwich was yummy - she said, but the french fries we always ask for  well done like black... and as usual - soggy crapola... The sliders for my 11 year old son were fine - but then again he bearly can wait to finish to get back to his iTOUCH games - which he tried to sneak a game in underneath the table... No Game Playing while we are together in the Family Buzzom as I put it :) 3+ hours go by and we are all spent - I am ready to get the hell outta HELL and while the wife is changing a poopy diaper I decided to pay the tab... and then it happened... I turned around to see the 80's video extra and the check falls to the ground - while she is holding plates so I pick it up for her and she motions with her lips to place it in her apron pocket... I tried to but it would not fit, as there was another check book inside the pocket already - she then smiles weirdly and colorfully says ""yeah a got a BIG ONE"" - and laughs...  Being that a joke like that usually would come from a drunk guy at a bar - i thought it was odd, yet par for her course with the entire ""get-up""... Needless to say my wife wanted to place her face on a milkcarton :)  So to top off the really long wait, really blah food and service - this was a HALF OF A STAR at best... Get your act together guys or you might end up with your CHEESE stuck out in the wind - at least at this location. There is Sawgrass and Aventura close buy - We probably won't be going back for a while... UGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Amy Jo A.,"Davie, FL",15,696,677,2.0,3/30/2012,"I can't seem to get by that this is a chain. Training could be improved. What happened to just letting everyone eat and finish their meal before clearing the table? My poor husband eats slow as we all do..him more so,and the waitress interrupts Us all to ask if we are finished...do we want dessert..and etc....all the while he is still eating and we are trying to talk! RUDE..training needed people. Dinner for 3 was about $80. And I had a hair in my dipping sauce.  gross. I would think the mgr would have suggested taking the small plate of $6.00 off the bill but he did not. Bad training and once again bad customer service...it wasn't my hair. I thought it ridiculous that I would have to suggest that they take it off our bill..didn't want to embarrass my son on his bIrthday so it will just be reflected on my not visiting too soon or at all. There are lots of restaurants in Pembroke Gardens Mall that want the business."
Daisy P.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",229,248,547,4.0,2/23/2014,Oh Cheesecake factory... Why do I love you so much? Is it your tasty Mai Tais? The incredibly fattening Chicken Bellagio.. or your delicious Tiramisu cheesecake? ... This place serves pretty much everything except Ribs.
Olga G.,"Miami, FL",0,2,,2.0,8/30/2015,"Worst Cheesecakr Factory I've been too.  Server was slow and messed up the order.  They finally brought my husband's entree 10 minutes after we had all finished eating.   On top of that, the manager came over to apologize offering a free cheesecake but refusing to comp the entree they messed up on.  I told her to keep her free cheesecake and she could keep the entree too.  Service was mediocre and the manager could use a refresher course on keeping repeat business.  She didn't get it right with us.  We definitely won't be going back to that location again."
Shauna S.,"San Francisco, CA",149,904,19,4.0,2/23/2014,"Cousin's night out! On my first night in town, after much debate, we decided to come here when we remembered that they have the most variety in terms of alcohol that is served. I had the veggie burger whereas my cousins split up several appetizer. I didn't try too many of the appetizers but I did have a bit of the hummus and it was delicious. At the end, we split a slice red velvet cheesecake and it was amazing. Great service and good food."
Chris P.,"Hollywood, FL",0,36,,3.0,4/9/2015,"20 years ago, this would have been 5 stars. But there were far fewer locations then and much longer waits. These days, the food is okay at best. On more than one occasion, there's been an issue with freshness/quality of ingredients. And cleanliness! The flatware is always dirty and the floors are covered in trash. That said, my daughter loves it, so we go"
Cathryn S.,"Hollywood, FL",8,8,6,3.0,5/2/2015,We enjoyed our food and the atmosphere. I would not recommend this place to families with small children as both my best friend and I have little girls. There was nowhere for us to change their diapers in the bathroom. They should think about whether they're going to be a family oriented restaurant or not and should make it clear that they don't have changing stations in the bathroom before you sit down!
Junior M.,"Hollywood, FL",8,63,23,4.0,11/29/2011,"Said I wasnt going to go back, but I do live in Cooper City and to find a decent place to eat is like NOT going to happen soooo.... I went back after my eh review with my family.  We tried the bar again and ordered a Mojoito from the bartender named Tiffany and LORD BLESS US AND SAVE US we have someone that can make a drink!!!!!!!!! We love Tiffany and will only drink at the CF when she is at the bar.  We sat outside and the food was good but the service was SAAAAALOWWWWWW. Will go back. Only because we dont have many choices out here."
Kellie P.,"Miami Beach, FL",10,76,35,3.0,1/31/2014,"I come for the cheesecake, but not often, because of the wait.  Expect an hour or more on the weekends.  The food is typically better than Red Robin or TGIF, so I can't say anything negative about the food.  Just come with some good apps on your phone or a book because you'll be waiting."
Joel R.,"Clermont, FL",0,3,1,5.0,7/17/2014,Great dining experience!  Had a small issue but was overwhelmed by the response to make it right!!!  Heidi came and wowed us!
