Jen T.,"Sunset Park, Brooklyn, NY",98,9,,1.0,11/9/2014,"This location is awful. Our waitress was never around. We waited 30 minutes for WATER, then when it did arrive, the cups were dirty. Our food came cold and overcooked. While we were waiting for our check, we watched a busser wipe down the table with a dirty towel and then with that same towel, he cleaned the silverware. GROSS. I will never come back here. I feel sick after eating here. A huge disappointment from a restaurant with a good reputation."
Cecilia S.,"Doral, FL",0,32,1,3.0,4/7/2013,"I ate her before so the food is always the same (giant portions! people who have a salad for an appetizer just have it as a meal because its so big and has a ridiculous amount of calories).The only thing that bothered me was the waiter. She was not knowledgeable with her stuff. Messed up on some orders and when I asked for a white wine spritzer she goes ""we don't have that. I don't even know what it is."" So I asked her to just tell the bartender and he even said he didn't know what it was. It is literally wine with club soda! So then when she comes back with it it tasted so bad! The mojito that my friend drank tasted horrible too. What a bad bartender."
Natasha G.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",73,98,22,1.0,1/5/2012,"Yuck!  Don't go here.  We gave them several chances, and it got worse each time.  Last time we were there, we received our food and it was uncooked.  It took 30 minutes to finally find our server.  We decided to just leave.  They even got our drinks wrong.  The manager did not charge us, but what a waste of time.  We ended up going across the street to the Tavern instead and it was very nice."
Yi L.,"Boca Raton, FL",62,305,334,1.0,3/17/2012,"It would be a negative star if it were allowed.  Horrible food, even worst service.  Skip this pace ..drive to any other location, but avoid this one. Went recently for a birthday dinner... The horrible waitress told us lie, after lie.  (the manage confirmed that it was a lie)... So disappointing."
Melli B.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",124,285,457,3.0,3/24/2012,"A chain with fresh food. I have yet to go to The Cheesecake Factory and have what I would consider a bad meal. This particular Cheesecake Factory has opened near my home at The Shops at Pembroke Gardens. They introduced their new SkinnyLicious menu which includes alcoholic beverages under 150 calories, and salads and entrees which I believe do not exceed 800 calories which is commendable since they are known for serving SALADS THAT ARE 1500 calories!! I am no stranger to The Cheesecake Factory because it's a nice ""girls day out"" Happy Hour spot. They have a really nice happy hour menu but it ends super early (6 pm) so you gotta rush to get there after work and then hope there is parking available. I recommend you try the avocado egg rolls, the mushroom lettuce wraps, and the Thai salmon.  The skinny menu is nice and has many options also. I'm sure no one is a stranger to the Cheesecake Factory as its a chain restaurant but if you're into Happy Hour with the girls or just hanging out for lunch with your significant other, they have outdoor seating and it's shaded. I think I might head over today for some crab cakes and a salad."
Veronica J.,"Marietta, GA",903,461,742,4.0,4/17/2012,great happy hour five dollar long island ice teas but yOu have to sit by the bAr from four to six pm And then they have five dollar food. it wAs good service was excellent from Shana!
Patty G.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",154,575,352,4.0,8/25/2011,"When I first discovered The Cheesecake Factory, it was a treat to go there. The ones that were around were far from where I lived so it was a special occasion to go there. Then, as it's gained popularity and the chains have increased in numbers.... it has become rather boring. In fact, the one in Aventural Mall is usually hit or miss. The food is good or it's pretty bad. It seems like the quality ranges depending on the chefs that night [?]. Who knows... but we decided to give this place a try---the second night it was open! Needless to say, everything is brand-spankin' new and beautiful. The menu's are not caked with sticky fingerprints and oily covers... the place was spotless. The wait was short [weekday] and the hostess was friendly. Our waitress was VERY nice! The pumpernickel bread was delicious, as usual. That's my fix. Then the fried mac-n-cheese balls of course... hit the spot. By the time the main dish came around we were stuffed. The plates here, as with all Cheesecake's, are ginormous and are easily 2 1/2-3 REAL servings. The all-american staple right there... HUGE plates of food. Anyways, we had the Fettuccine Chicken and Sun-Dried Tomato pasta. It was delicious but such a huge plate. I also had the house Merlot which is called THE CHEESECAKE FACTORY and it's bottled by Robert Mondavi--- never knew this before! And we never got to the cheesecake as we were so stuffed from everything else. I'm always bumbed when I don't eat cheesecake at the Cheesecake Factory.... I mean, it's just the principle of it all."
Joaquin R.,"Miami, FL",290,185,4,4.0,9/19/2012,"Great customer service, decor, and delicious food at a great value. Negative: Long wait time."
David W.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",157,175,350,3.0,4/10/2012,"Food was great but the service was terrible. I am a Cheesecake fan but this store has issues. When I go out to eat its about the whole experience, not just the food. No matter how good the meal, if the service sucks, its not worth my time. Missed orders, lack of attention, and the non caring attitude of the server are enough to keep me from coming back to this establishment. On more than one occasion this has happened and not on days when it has been busy. Sad to report this but better restaurants very close by will be getting my business."
C M.,"Hialeah, FL",0,15,,1.0,10/17/2013,"After boycotting this restaurant for a few months due to awful service and poorly/incorrectly prepared food, I decided to come back. Three visits now, I have found tiny bugs in my lettuce. Not only will I not return here, but I am now permanently disgusted by lettuce and salads in general bc of my experience here. They obviously do not care either, bc I have complained each time it has occurred! Thanks alot Cheesecake Factory."
Eddy A.,"Miami, FL",100,107,23,1.0,9/26/2011,"the wait is always long and the food portions are bigger than your head. its a great place to waste time, gain weight, and conceive early on-set diabetes.  enjoy!"
Brandy S.,"Hollywood, FL",0,18,1,3.0,7/4/2014,"The food is fantastic and desserts to die for. We live close to the one in Pembroke Pines and would like to order take out, except they either never answer the phone or answer and put you on hold for 10 minutes.  We end up ordering elsewhere. I do not recommend take out there unless you are lucky enough to get someone to answer the phone."
Wendy V.,"Miami Beach, FL",51,134,57,2.0,11/20/2011,"I love the CCF, but in this one for some reason the drinks are made for kids!!! Ok, I'm not a drinker but I was on my girls night out reunion and I wanted a Cosmopolitan, so I order it and unfortunately for me,  the bartender forgot the main ingredient ALCOHOL!!!!  ;-("
Maite H.,"Miami Lakes, FL",60,132,20,3.0,11/20/2011,Typical cheesecake factory although it is way more packed and not very huge.  The crowds and lines on the weekend are simply not worth the wait.  The food is consistent to other Cheesecake factories.  The service was great the day I went but it was also a Tuesday night.  The wait was 20 minutes and it wasn't packed at all.  I do like that another restaurant was added to Pembroke Gardens since it always seems the rest have astronomical weights.
Eileen J.,"Hollywood, FL",1,35,4,1.0,9/19/2014,"Went here yesterday for a late lunch with my family.  We were seated immediately but that's as far as the positives go.  We were seated on a pile of filth.  There was so much trash on the floor, seemed like no one has cleaned it ALL day.  Our waitress took our drink order and she just seemed like she had no want to be at her job.  We had no utensils or napkins.  I had to get up and take it from another table.  The bread was STALE! We didn't eat it and sent it back.  The bread plates on the table were also dirty, I had to clean it with my napkins.  My husband and my food came out 15 minutes BEFORE our kids.  The waitress was no where to be seen.  Normally kids food comes out first.  My husband and I both order from the lunch menu and ordered the Crusted Romano Chicken.  The pasta was dry, barely had any sauce. I can see now why this place was so empty yesterday.  Bad Service, Bad Cleanliness, Bad Food."
Robert W.,"Miami-Dade, FL",0,111,188,3.0,1/20/2012,Would like to give 2-1/2 stars.....It's packed. Long waits and then long waits once seated. It's amazing how many people go to TCF as the food is ok at best. Cheesecake are the star but remember they are 1000-1500 cal each
Tammy B.,"Hollywood, FL",70,32,22,5.0,1/2/2012,There is always a wait but the food and service is worth it.  Try the pineapple upside down cake cheesecake.  Its AmAZiNg! I am looking forward to trying the brunch menu!!
Luix C.,"Hialeah, FL",0,16,,1.0,2/8/2014,"The place is the most inefficient restaurant I've ever visited.  They tell you the wait time is 30 minutes and an hour later you are still waiting.  My wife asked the hostess twice why the long wait and was told both times ""you are next"".  Several people that arrived after us were seated before.  The last time my wife asked the hostess why the long wait, I said ""we are not eating here"" and all of the sudden the manager was trying to apologize - WELL TOO LATE.  If you want disrespectful treatment then definitely visit this place.  I think all Cheesecake Factory locations are a joke and should be boycotted."
Annie M.,"Durham, NC",2,14,16,5.0,9/26/2011,The food is always great! No matter the location!!!  I have nothing bad to say about the Cheesecake Factory.  I always leave with a slice of Red Velvet cheesecake....
Harvey D.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",216,406,,4.0,4/29/2013,"The Cheesecake Factory is the Cheesecake Factory with the exception of one location in which if you have read my other Yelps, you know what I am talking about.  I had a gift card so my wife and I decided to try this location since we had only ordered carryout from here in the past.  We requested a table outside and we didn't have to wait at all for one.  We were greeted promptly by Jerica.  Yes, her name was Jerica and she told us she was named for the character in Gem and the Holograms.  Can't say I've heard that one before!  I usually order the Grande Burrito from The Cheesecake Factory; however, I wasn't super hungry that night so I decided on the chicken and biscuits instead.  I asked a few questions about this dish and seeing where I was going with this, the waitress let me know that she thought this probably wasn't a good dish for me to order since they put butter all over it.  She did check with the chef and he agreed and advised me to order something else since butter and I don't get along too well.  I took a few more minutes and ended up with the crispy buffalo chicken sandwich and fries.  The sandwich was good, not great and I probably will stick to non-sandwich items going forward although the burgers are pretty good.  Jerica was an excellent waitress including refilling our drinks, bringing the bread, delivering our food in a timely manner and taking care of the check very promptly.  She was definitely one of the better waitresses I have had recently.  Will I go back?  Sure.  But I'll make sure I am hungry and feast upon the Grande Burrito."
