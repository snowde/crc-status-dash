Lola S.,"Hollywood, FL",0,2,,1.0,4/29/2012,"While I'm not usually a big fan of Cheesecake Factory, the weekend brunch is usually pretty decent. I went to this location today for brunch...It was terrible. There wasn't even much effort put into scrambling the eggs since they were practically raw,  the pancakes were sour (and these were not the lemon ricotta ones) and the service was horrendous. There's not too much of a selection of restaurants here in Pembroke Pines, but I can certainly do without paying for raw eggs and bad service."
Gryssel C.,"Hollywood, FL",0,1,,2.0,2/11/2012,"I was thrilled to hear that a Cheesecake factory had opened in my area since I have been to the one in Aventura and have never been disappointed with their food. Being  a new restaurant, in the area the wait was rather long but expected. No complaints about the waiter but the food left much to be desired and very disappointing. i ordered a chicken dish and the second piece was completely burned on the bottom which I did not taste until I had eaten the first piece. By then I felt it was too late to return the food. The next time I will inspect my food closely prior to eating it. Don't think I will be going back anytime soon. The wait was not worth the food which was sub-standard...unlike the other Cheesecake factory rest. I have been to."
Jessica C.,"Miami, FL",0,31,,5.0,8/13/2012,Excellent service! Delicious food. Wait isn't very long and the hostess is very friendly and polite. Lovely location and atmosphere! Chocolate mouse cheese cake is to die for! :-D
