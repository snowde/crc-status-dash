Customer Service Oriented Guest C.,"Miami Gardens, FL",0,2,,1.0,8/28/2017,"I do not recommend the Cheesecake Factory in Pembroke Pines.  The food is terrible. Years ago I visited this location for the first time for a birthday event.  I ordered a dish that I typically order at the Aventura location.  When the food came, it was disgusting.  I swore off this location.  Recently, however, I was in the area and had a craving for Evenlyn's Favorite Pasta (which I have had before at Aventura and loved it).  I decided to get it at the PP location out of sheer convenience and because I figured that enough years had passed that perhaps the quality of the food had improved.  I was wrong.  By comparison to the Aventura location, it was again terrible.  I will never buy food at this location again."
Janine A.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",53,11,4,5.0,3/25/2017,Our server Abraham was awesome we told him we had to be out by 430pm and he got us out by 430 pm his recommendations were excellent and the service was great. Even with the rude male hostess everything was amazing.
Marcus V.,"Hialeah, FL",1,12,21,5.0,6/16/2017,"Went in for a late lunch date for my girlfriends birthday around 4:30pm on Wednesday so the place was fairly empty compared to the usual busy crowd on a Friday night or even the weekends. We were sat down quickly and attended to on a regular basis which was nice, since the service can usually take much longer depending on the time of the day. We ordered the fried mac and cheese balls as an appetizer and got them cheap since it was happy hour. They were delicioussssss, it brings 4 balls so we split two a piece, nice crunchy outside layer with the gooy goodness of the mac and cheese (P.S make sure to have them with the marinara sauce on the plate). For our late lunch she ordered the four cheese pasta w/o chicken (optional) and I ordered the fettuccini alfredo w/o chicken (optional as well). Let me say the food was delicious! A nice creamy and silky fettuccini pasta with the perfect mix of alfredo sauce, scrumptious. The serving size could seem a bit small to a person with a huge appetite but it filled me up. Now for the four cheese pasta, it's served with a ball of ricotta cheese so it is recommended to stir it up in its entirety as the plate of pasta is steaming hot. The four cheeses were definitely present in the pasta and the flavouring was perfect."
Abby F.,"Oviedo, FL",62,1,1,2.0,7/1/2017,I used to love Cheesecake Factory but now they are ripping customers off by making their cheesecake slices smaller. I got a small slice of cheesecake for $8+ which is ridiculous.
Nathali A.,"Algonquin, Louisville, KY",106,1,,1.0,11/25/2017,"If I could give it zero stars I would. Tonight at this location I ordered the lemon-herb roasted chicken which I have ordered dozens of times before. They gave me chicken breasts covered in a sauce. This is not what the dish should be at all. It should be half a chicken roasted. I called the waiter over and his response was ""I have no clue what that is"". That is not exactly something you want to hear from your waiter at all. The manager came over and apologized and offered to make me something else. So I ordered the chicken piccata which my sister also had. It was pasta and chicken drench in this oily mystery sauce instead of its normal lemon sauce. They also did not offer to take my plate off the bill after the entire issue. After returning home, my sister ended up getting sick because of the food. This is possibly the worst experience I have had at a Cheesecake Factory and I will not be returning."
Jeffeory H.,"Miramar, FL",44,537,475,4.0,7/29/2016,"I usually love the food at the Cheesecake Factory, but this one is just not as good as others around town. This place is always super busy so plan ahead if you are coming here. Thankfully we arrived before the dinner rust and didn't have a wait. The staff was great and the service was great."
Val P.,"Pompano Beach, FL",0,4,6,1.0,6/22/2017,Ordered the steak medallions for takeout; what I received was extremely disappointing and unappetizing. Would not recommend.
Josephine F.,"Miami Lakes, FL",20,17,3,2.0,5/21/2017,"The 2  hostess they have working are horrible for seating arrangements.  We are a party of 3 and we're passed over several times.  When I asked them they said, ""we seat bigger party's first"".  I told them it's not fair that we were told 20 minute wait and it took 54 minutes to seat us; only after in requested to speak to the manager.  The food is consistently good and service was average."
Erin S.,"Weston, FL",1,8,,5.0,5/17/2017,"Awesome place, with excellent food, great skinny menu (lighter fare) and cheesecake to die for, but THEY DO NOT TAKE RESERVATIONS!!! They seat you in the order you check in, so if it looks busy, either valet that car or drop someone off to put your name in!"
Adriana M.,"Kissimmee, FL",40,13,2,4.0,4/21/2017,"The steak tacos were really good, I'm not a fan of Cheesecake Factory but I was surprised I actually enjoyed the food. Prices are ok."
Jessica S.,"Davie, FL",34,56,39,4.0,6/26/2016,"Came in to use our gift cards. Ordered today and was pleasantly satisfied  with our orders Avocado,zucchini,mushroom fries. Great  appetizer. Diane steak medium , amaze balls! And teryaki chicken. We left content and sadly with no room for dessert this time. Also the decor and restaurant are lovely."
Justin K.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",174,37,13,2.0,11/18/2016,If your order take out be prepared to wait at least 45mins - 1 hour. I'm not sure if they don't care about take out at this location or what but it is a very long wait compared to other Cheesecakes around the area.
Geri E.,"North Miami Beach, FL",47,19,22,2.0,8/31/2016,"For some reason,  everything we ordered was horrible.  My Cobb  salad was wilted and brown,  my friend dynamite shrimp was soft and tasted rubbery.  The service was ok.  Overall,  not pleased and I'm hungry."
Jasper H.,"Miami, FL",232,144,150,3.0,11/9/2015,"The main reason for the 3-star rating is the slow service you get 50% of the time. I totally understand  if the kitchen is backed up during the busy hour, but when the restaurant is less than half full it shouldn't take half an hour to bring out two lunch entrees. The staff are relatively friendly for the most part, so thumbs up for that. There happy hour specials are awesome! My recommendation is the happy hour burger because you will get the most bang for your buck. It's basically your standard double cheeseburger on a brioche bun. For $5.50 Avocado eggrolls have a nice tangy taste to them and comes with a sweet Asian-pesto like sauce. Definitely worth trying. Cheesecakes are a little overpriced in my opinion. One slice goes about $7. That's more expensive than getting a meal off the happy hour menu. In my opinion, desserts should definitely be cheaper than the actual entree itself for a even sweeter ending to your meal. My favorite is the tiramisu and white chocolate macadamia cheesecake. Mojito and Long Island iced tea are on par. Get those during happy hour."
Nikki A.,"Miami, FL",21,14,,5.0,1/13/2017,This place is delicious everything on the menu is great and everything is served fresh. I go here all the time for lunch and dinner but my favorite is the sunday brunch. Great location accessible to shops nearby you can make a day of it at this location. The staff is exceptional!
Jorge D.,"Miami, FL",107,183,54,3.0,11/23/2016,"The Cheesecake factory is a chain restaurant and a good one.  The menu is gigantic which means there can be really long waits for ordering, especially in big parties.  Good place, good food, good service! also it probably goes without saying, but try the cheesecake."
Alex S.,"Miramar, FL",113,72,40,5.0,8/25/2016,"So we had a dinner night with the wife and the kids. There was an obvious wait that they said would take about 20 min. It only took about 10 minutes. They took us to our table and we were introduced by sebastian and his new trainee Carlos.  He took our order fairly quickly! My daughter ordered a Shirley temple, that did not taste right so they had replaced it. Carlos came back to check on us all the time and he was wonderful and a great server. He was very professional and he will be a great asset to this business. Great job to him, i see him with great potential! Thanks"
Ada N.,"Miramar, FL",61,5,,1.0,8/10/2017,Food is hit or miss. Overdone or too salty. Wait is hours long. Two bathroom stalls for a huge restaurant is ridiculous. There are plenty of other places that are better.
BadAzzCuban A.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",51,5,,2.0,4/1/2017,"Where do I begin? The floor was so greasy it was like walking on a Slip n Slide. Not greasy in one spot - nasty greasy from the waiting area all the way to the table. While the service and appetizers were good, it took forever to get our entrees. One of our drink refills  had to have something in it because the server made a face  just as he was going to set it down on the table, said it looked funny, and took it back to the  kitchen. Two meals were cooked improperly and were taken back to the kitchen, so two of us sat there and watched our companions eat their dinner. Our food came out after everyone else was done eating. The only bright spot here is they offered a few complementary slices of cheesecake to make up for all of the mistakes. The cheesecakes were absolutely divine."
Rebeca P.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",31,20,1,5.0,2/10/2017,"I love The Cheesecake Factory and I love this mall. So every time I have the chance to come I really enjoy myself. Good food, nice place."
