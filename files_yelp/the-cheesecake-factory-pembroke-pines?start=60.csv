Shanta J.,"Springfield, MO",4,50,132,4.0,6/29/2016,We went on Fathers Day and it was a 2 hour wait! We did have a place to sit while we waited and there were stores around to shop in so it actually wasn't to bad. We were seated and our waitress was very tentative. We had a large party and she was able to keep up with the entire tables needs. I hadn't been to the Cheesecake Factory in so long and the menu has changed I was able to still order one of my favs shrimp scampi even though I didn't see it in the menu. The food was great and of course the cheesecake was awesome!
Kayla J.,"Davie, FL",1,19,6,5.0,8/4/2016,"Writing this as I'm still dining in! Came in tonight, a Thursday night with my family of 5 around 7:45 and was sat pretty quickly. I'm just blown away by our server Tatiana! She is so attentive and on point with everything. I'm in the restaurant business myself and when I see great service I truly appreciate it. Definitely give Tatiana some praise and a raise! Lol thank you cheesecake of Pembroke gardens."
Mike S.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",0,2,5,4.0,2/1/2016,"Well it's a chain and I'm not big into chain restaurants but their  food is pretty good. I can't say I've always had a great meal, there was one time I ordered chicken enchiladas . They were just ok, not something I would order again. Everything else has been really good, the dish I love and order often is the Tuscan chicken. My favorite.  The service has always been good, they are usually very attentive and friendly. They also are well versed on the dishes and able to answer any questions I've had.  This last trip I tried their cheesecake, I know it's called Cheesecake factory and after 5 visits it's the first time I ordered their cheesecake. Omg it way heavenly, rich but delicious.  Cheesecake factory has an insane amount of items, I'm not sure how they pull it off but they really do a great job."
Rebeca M.,"Hialeah, FL",0,10,3,2.0,8/1/2017,We got there at about 9pm so it was pretty dark as you can imagine. We chose to sit outside because that was the shortest wait but I really regret it now. The lights they had outside were tiny so they didn't do much to illuminate  but that wouldn't have been so bad if they actually worked. I looked all around and half of the lights weren't working at all. We had to use our phones to look at the menu. We told our waiter and he said he couldn't do anything about it. Okay but can you move us to a table with working lights? Or inside? I didn't make a fuss about it because I was with my family but I can't believe management at this location would be so careless. Oh and it was raining hard. They did lower these curtains to keep the rain out but our feet still got wet even when it was all the way down. I also felt like the staff took longer to serve us maybe because they forgot about us? Don't eat outside guys.
MICHELLE C.,"Plantation, FL",2316,2081,4444,3.0,5/9/2014,"After shopping in the heat all we wanted was some air conditioning and food and beer.  The Cheesecake Factory has such a huge menu even when I have know idea what I am in the mood to eat I can find something here. This location seems to be one of the better ones.  Every single staff member was super friendly and they were working so hard non stop. Our server was great. We started with some beer and we ordered an appetizer of zucchini, mushroom and avocado fries which came with two sauces. They were delicious.  I think I would come back just for these again.  Super fresh, very lightly breaded and the two sauces were excellent.  One was a garlic aioli and the other had a spiciness to it.  Then I ordered the cheese steak sandwich and my daughter had the spicy chicken sandwich.  The cheesecake sandwich was bland, no real flavor and the meat was quite tough. I took plenty home for hubby to eat.  My daughters chicken sandwich was very good. The prices are fair, portions are huge, and the food is fairly good. Thumbs up for the staff here, they give great service. I am not a cheesecake fan but walking past the case of all the fresh cheesecakes almost had me ordering one.  I didn't but they had some very pretty looking cheesecakes."
George M.,"Maspeth, Queens, NY",13,13,12,4.0,1/2/2017,Do you know typical commercial stuff you get what you pay for massive amounts of cheesecake selections for the better of the commercial food chance I guess
Natalie R.,"Hialeah, FL",1,2,1,1.0,1/7/2017,I went to The Cheesecake Factory with my fiancé and was there for 2 hours while all it took us to eat our food was less then 20 min. They took forever to give us our appetizer I understand it is the kitchen that taking long but they could have told us 20 min into it that it was gonna take a while. They then brought the main course to us fast because it was already done waiting for us. Once we were done eating it took 30 min for us to see our waiter. I was not even in a bad mood this was just bad service. The manager even came to talk to us about the food taking long and they did not even give a type of discount. I will not be coming back and I will worn everyone I know of this bad service.
Mariah M.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",28,64,107,1.0,3/22/2016,"I like going here because it's super close to home, the wait isn't usually very long and the cheesecake of course is to die for. My last time there this past Friday kind of ruined it for me, the service was adequate but the food always seems to fall short. My husband ordered the Louisiana Cajun pasta and I feel like the cooks are drowning the food in oil because when his big bowl of pasta arrived it was like we were eating liquid grease out of the fryer. I ordered a side of Mac & cheese, the quality of the cheese must be extremely trashy because again oily and greasy. Also had the fried avocado, zucchini, mushroom fries, and they had a nice crisp crust thankfully. After such a disappointing meal I had no desire for dessert and won't be going back to waste anymore money on oil for dinner."
Terry M.,"Opa-locka, FL",117,2,,3.0,1/1/2017,Cheesecake Factory food is always good.  I don't like this restaurant at all because they always keep it too cold.  There is no reason the patrons have to be so cold that it is completely impossible to eat inside.  The temperature last night inside the restaurant was unbearable. I don't understand management that allows that to happen.  Clueless
Angel M.,"Boca Del Mar, FL",38,26,31,4.0,4/9/2016,"Don't really come here for the food often but I admit the cheesecake here is phenomenal. The take out line takes forever on weekends so try to come during the week to avoid all the waiting. I like it that they have a ""skinny menu"" where you can order food that's easy on calories."
Dan S.,"Miami, FL",72,13,5,4.0,11/18/2016,Always a good spot for a small plate menu item or try one of their entrees. You won't be disappointed. Just make sure to keep some room for the delicious cheesecake. My favorite is the dulce de leche with extra whipped cream and brickell ( not sure how it's spelt) enjoy!
Rachael B.,"Houston, TX",24,122,217,5.0,4/21/2016,"We had a Great happy hour experience. Drink and apps  for $5.50 4-7pm and the drinks are strong! The waitress was awesome, we only had an hour til our movie started and she got us in and out with 15 mins to spare! Will be hitting this spot up a lot more!"
Mike J.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",4,19,10,5.0,6/15/2016,Awesome experience our server was attentive to us. Food was great but the best part is always the delicious variety of cheesecake
Jay L.,"Miami, FL",124,8,1,5.0,1/16/2017,Had the chicken and biscuit meal and I loved it. The place is clean and spacious. Will go often.
Julianne A.,"Hollywood, FL",67,38,4,4.0,6/2/2017,I love the decor and atmosphere but it is very busy and noisy. The menus are super decent. I love the miso salmon. I crave it couple times a year. And the passion fruit tea is a 5 star tea! I come here for the tea and couple of entrees that bring my cravings back here again and again. Waiters and waitresses are friendly!
Karen D.,"Waterford Township, MI",5,31,2,3.0,5/11/2016,"When you have the dish in the name of your chain, you really only need to do that one dish properly to keep people coming back. The Pembroke Pines Cheesecake factory does this EXACTLY. PROs: Red Velvet cheesecake was AMAZING per usual.  -They were even kind enough to split a slice so I could share it with my coworker. I don't know if this is a company wide practice as some sites will do it without a problem but others end up being a bit confused when I request it. Cons: Other foods were disappointing. -I was dining here with some coworkers. I got a sandwich and fries while they ordered more complicated dishes. One coworker got the fried mac and cheese as an entree. They did arrive with the other entrees but they were cold. While I have no proof, I assume that they were prepared to be sent as an app, read the ticket and kept the dish back and sent it out with the other entrees. My other coworker got a salmon dish that was unmemorable other than the fact that the taste of the salmon was completely masked by a mess of ""herbs"" and butter. (I tried A bite and didn't ask for more. She did not finish it either.)   As a prologue, I REALLY HOPE THAT THIS HAS BEEN FIXED BY THE TIME THIS IS POSTED: -I went to the restroom. In the ladies' room, there were 2 stalls. I opened the door to the handicapped stall and saw it was occupied by an older woman with a walker. I tried to apologize and she said it was ok as the lock was broken. I have to wonder how long it had been like this without any one noticing such an easily fixed problem."
Yami P.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",41,50,,2.0,12/11/2016,The last time I was here the guy took our order and never came back till he brought the food which was like 40 minutes or so later . One of the people we went with his water had finished and this guy just disappeared. The service is not the great . This is why I barely come here but my daughter insisted to come . They need their waiters properly trained maybe they should ask lime  because their service is amazing by their staff . I've never had any complaints and always wondered how they train their staff because of the great service ...
Dc C.,"Hialeah Gardens, FL",600,25,2,4.0,10/23/2016,Pretty tasty food and great staff! Loveee the Mac and cheese balls delish! The wait wasn't that bad either for a Sunday afternoon 20 minutes for two people.
Ralphie A.,"Miami Lakes, FL",12,22,116,1.0,11/2/2014,"We usually come to this location about 2-3 times per month. Also, we always eat at the bar or bar high tables. Always have an enjoyable meal until tonight. We sat at the bar to enjoy a relaxing meal and drink on a Sunday evening. Until a man sat at the bar with his 3 children, all aged what it seemed to be between 5-12.  I am not one to dislike children but there is a place for everything and a bar is not a place for small children. They were screaming and moving around changing seats and standing up the entire time. I was left with a ring on my left ear, and what was supposed to be a relaxing time to have a glass of wine and unwind ended up being an annoying obnoxious night.  Furthermore, I ordered the chicken Marsala which I've had many times and the sauce was watered down.   I will not be going back for a long time. If ever."
Leah L.,"Miami, FL",7,46,16,5.0,9/30/2016,"By far my favorite location,While Aventura is closer I'll take the drive for better service. My waiter Monday Night was Issac he was great! Very attentive.  Food was  fresh & delicious."
