Allen C.,"Miramar, FL",381,145,271,4.0,8/27/2015,"Whatever the people at Cheesecake Factory corporate are doing to have this chain of excellent restaurants succeed the way they are, they've succeeded again.  Yeah, you're going to pay a pretty penny for some good food. But it's worth it every time. Given that the menu can and has always been overwhelming with the almost endless selection of dishes, it makes it difficult to choose. But overall, they hit it on the mark with great service, food, drinks, decor and atmosphere."
Ariana M.,"Hialeah, FL",0,2,,2.0,4/11/2017,"Ordered the Four Cheese Pasta with chicken. It came out with 2 chunks of chicken and had the waitress take it back. The next plate arrived and it looked delicious and actually had an abundance of food. When I took the first bite, it had a freezer burn taste. The manager came to the table and I explained the problem. He defended his restaurant by saying nothing is ever frozen; completely missing the point of the food having an odd taste. Another person in my party had the same dish and it tasted completely different from mine. The manager continued to explain how nothing is ever frozen, again missing the point. Horrible experience."
Caro B.,"Hialeah, FL",0,21,4,5.0,2/21/2017,This place has always been good when I've gone but it does get busy! The wait usually isn't too long for lunch on the weekends but I recommend making reservations no matter what time u go if you don't like to wait.
Sharyna B.,"Miramar, FL",150,70,211,2.0,1/30/2016,"I have been to this restaurant a few times and this last time I was not a fan. We were place out side to dine which was fine. However the sun was blinding anyone facing the sun and when the shade was adjusted, the people not facing the sun backs were burnt by the sun. This is a poor design. The waitress was very nice and tried to accommodate us but there was nothing she could do. They need to resign the shade/awning to keep their patrons from dealing with the sun. The food is ok. I will say the drinks were good."
Adriano P.,"North Miami, FL",319,137,232,4.0,10/18/2015,"Good service and good food. Consistent in all of their locations. We always get tamales, and salmon and salads. The black bread is amazing and dulce de leche cheesecake to die for."
Alissa W.,"Miami, FL",1931,940,91,3.0,7/1/2015,"This was a good find I was meeting a friend in Pembroke Commons for lunch. I noticed there was a cheesecake factory that popped up on my yelp. I went for lunch there was a ton of parking available. The service was good, and I like how they have lunch size portions.  Since this area is full of chain restaraunts that are all fairly average I figured I couldn't go wrong with a classic like cheesecake factory. Although, one thing I noticed there salad dressing over The years has changed it is definitely not as fresh as they used to be. They defiantly are buying they already made."
Armando G.,"Winter Garden, FL",68,215,461,4.0,7/11/2015,"Other than the usually long wait, I love every single thing about The Cheesecake Factory. They have great appetizers, great entrees, delicious cheesecake and good service...and great free bread.  Favorite appetizers: Tex Mex Eggrolls, Avocado Eggrolls, Fried Mac & Cheese, Buffalo Blasts, Thai Lettuce Wraps and Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes.  Favorite Entrees: Chicken Di Pana, Caramel Chicken, Orange Chicken, Spicy Cashew Chicken and the Monte Cristo Sandwich.  Dessert: Any and all cheesecakes.  You just can't go wrong here."
Beatrice N.,"Miami, FL",20,34,42,3.0,1/2/2016,"I love Cheesecake Factory and this one is good for location and convenience. The food is always delish and same decorations as others since its franchise, however, the service here is okay compared to others. Staff has improved with service, efficiency and politeness. It is always packed here weekdays and weekends. A 3-star as it is Cheesecake Factory, nothing fancy or extraordinary."
Anthony E.,"Boca Raton, FL",0,6,,1.0,9/11/2016,am a loyal customer to cheescake factory as we do my birthday and everyone's birthday day there every year and we go and eat lunch and or dinner every now and then. I have experienced the worst experience not once but twice at this location. The manager his highly disrespectful and this Saturday that just passed approximately around 11am my daughter and her grandmother went out on a little outing and went to cheescake factory as it is basically out family place and not only did the hostess pushed her down the waiting list letting people in front of her but when my mom asked for a manager she was given an attitude and waited an hour for a table for 2 with no preferred area to sit. Took the server 20minutes to even come to the table and he claimed he didn't know what the baby plate is which is offered at EVERY cheesecake factory and when my mom asked if he could ask his fellow workers he went to the manager and they went off on my mom basically calling her stupid and insane. What kind of service is this ? I am outraged ! Cannot believe this is how you train your employees to treat the elderly especially in front of a toddler. I am at absolute disgust. She finally ordered something came out cold and spent $38 on a worthless meal and crappy service. I am very disappointed and I think my family and I will never be returning again to any of your locations. This is complete outrage and disgust.  If I could give you no stars I would
Anna P.,"Miami, FL",92,60,349,4.0,5/29/2015,"Food is always great here and David, our waiter was extra friendly and helpful.  However we waited over an hour for a table and we were with my grandma who is 90 and in a wheelchair.  And still they made us wait, and wait and wait.  Parking was hard to find. Next time I will go to another location"
The S.,"Davie, FL",0,12,,1.0,5/11/2016,"The most disgusting greasy floor! As you get seated you will noticed trying to balance yourself from not falling due to the grease floor your walking on. What a hazard and liability this place bringing my family and kids! Is your kitchen in the dining room? Management should be fired for even allowing this. I can only imagine how your kitchen is. You guys want 15% tip? I'll give u a tip "" Clean your disgusting greasy floors""!"
Khameelah R.,"North Miami, FL",0,1,,1.0,3/4/2017,"Worst cheescake factory experience ever. I have been for over 3 hours, and have yet to get my food, i ordered a salad... A SALAD and pasta how long does it take to put some lettuce on a bowl, and boil some pasta?!. I made ""reservations"" and they still took long to seat us... dont come here if your really hungry, cause you will have to wait a long time..."
Sarah L.,"Southwest Ranches, FL",0,14,,1.0,8/9/2016,"This cheesecake factory is always busy! The food is consistent but the service is not. Went in for takeout today and observed a manager texting on his phone for five minutes while the takeout area was overwhelmed with customers waiting.  I should've taken it as a bad sign when I called and was put on hold for five minutes just to place my order. Most corporate restaurants like the cheesecake factory usually have extremely high standards regarding customer service, it is unfortunate that this cheesecake factory seems to be lacking in that area. One other problem we have experienced at this particular location which is disgusting, is that the people who were serving the cheesecakes were not wearing gloves and were pretty much sticking their fingers into our desserts. My husband was picking up takeout watching this occurrence and he asked them if they could put on some gloves and pack up some new desserts for us, which they did without hesitation. But I don't think a customer should have to ask for people to be sanitary when someone is handling their food."
Rebecca U.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",579,116,181,4.0,5/31/2014,"There were so many people waiting outside, I thought for sure there would be a long wait. But the hostess said for 2 it would be 15 min, and then we noticed an open table at the bar so we grabbed it-no waiting! Awesome, server promptly brought menus, took drink orders, and within 5 min I had my wine, ice water and bread. We decided to try ""fried macaroni and cheese balls"" sounds a little insane, but my daughter wanted to try it so we ordered it. Four big balls of Mac and cheese, coated with breading and fried, served with a cream tomato sauce, not too bad. For our entrée, decided to split the teriyaki chicken, substituting mashed potatoes instead of rice. Omg those potatoes are amazing!! Perfect consistency and texture. The chicken was cooked perfectly, and the teriyaki sauce was just sweet enough!  So filling, had to pass on the cheesecake dessert! Oh well, maybe next time!"
Dayana M.,"Hollywood, FL",7,9,,5.0,1/5/2016,"Love this Restaurant!They give nice warm multi-grain bread, have great fresh food that has labeled the calories your getting. I love the skinny menu, my fiance loves the Alfredo pasta they serve with added cheese by the server in front of you. The cheesecake factory is great for a romantic night out, birthday, or special occasion. Lovely outdoor tables with accent candles. The bar has a great selection of drinks :) And of course my favorite cheesecake is the red velvet and  some strawberry's on top. Yummm If you haven't been here it would be worth your time."
Carlos J.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",21,9,16,4.0,1/5/2016,"Great place to have a meal, but careful with with the white bread you may break a tooth, waitress was so nice ! Jan 5 2015."
Marvin A.,"Hialeah, FL",109,127,225,5.0,10/11/2015,"Visited the Resturant on a busy Friday afternoon, I haven't been here in a long time and there was absolutely no parking space. Literally all of the spots were taken, so after driving around hunting for a spot I dropped of my gf at the front door. Finally found a spot and the place was slammed. We found seats at the bar and we were debating wether or not to wait for a table and I'm so glad we decided to stay at the bar. We met Marissa she's the bartender of the night and let me tell ya she was on fire. She attended everyone and every drink order that was being placed. She handled every request swiftly with accuracy.  She immediately got our drinks, that amazing bread and put the baseball game that we requested. She was a little energizer bunny, TFC you have a very valuable asset and it was a delight watching her perform. Extremely friendly, we got to know that she's an eagles fan, recommended the specials for the night and made sure our drinks were topped of. Again all while this place is slammed with people everywhere.  Moving on to the app we went with the avocado rolls, much better than the ones from bj's. Not spicy and they deliver the taste. For the entree I went with the Caesar salad and my gf went with the steak tacos. We asked for extra cheese on the side, a few lemons and balsamic vinaigrette and the girls in the back were also on their game. I will be coming back and recommend this place very highly for their service/quality keep up the good work, and make sure to take care of Marissa even though she's not a dolphins fan ;)"
Laura F.,"Manhattan, NY",87,51,94,5.0,8/8/2015,"This place gets better and better,,, fuller and fuller! Billy Ray was fantastic! Had the Chinese chicken salad that was awesome.. but those skinnylicious lettuce wraps get an A+!!!! That brown oat bread... keep away if you are watching your weight!!! Once you eat a piece. . Its all over!!! You can easily eat a whole loaf!!!"
Lenya S.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",78,78,245,4.0,6/6/2015,"Cheesecake anyone ?!?!  The food is okay, the typical assorted American/italian/ healthy plates, but those cheesecakes are fire! There's not one I have tried that has disappointed me. We like to order the spinach dip- it's one of the best ones I've had. If you're a fan of chicken Marsala stay away from it here, the sauce is to acidi (hope that makes sense).  The pork chop plate and seared ahi tuna are both delicious: highly recommend to try it. Normally, I go to the location in Pembroke shops, but it doesn't matter which one you go to it's always super busy. The restaurant is big with a wide range of outside seating. One comment would be for the amount of capacity the restaurant sits, the bathrooms should be bigger.  To end your dinner on a happy note, try the white chocolate raspberry cheesecake it's a crime LOL!"
Colleen G.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",2,53,96,5.0,9/28/2015,"Fast service, friendly and attentive waiters. Got in and out no time.  Great atmosphere New skinny menu is added bonus"
