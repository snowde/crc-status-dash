David P.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,184,,4.0,11/14/2017,"A rock solid performance! Very happy. Clean. Friendly, prompt, attentive service. Ahi entree was superb. Very good quantity. Perfect sear. Excellent wasabi in the rice. Bacon bacon burger cooked correctly as ordered. The desserts never disappoint."
Cynthia V.,"Phoenix, AZ",71,15,4,2.0,1/5/2018,"My family and I went to the Cheesecake Factory for dinner tonight. We sat out side, it was perfect and the food really good. Well as soon as we arrived home. My husband ran to the bathroom and threw up every thing . We called and spoke to the manager on duty. He didn't take his name and phone number or any thing . Just said he will look into it.  Didn't really seem to be to concerned ! We won't go there again ."
Kirk W.,"Peoria, AZ",0,8,,1.0,11/16/2017,Went here last night to celebrate my Wife's Birthday... What a huge disappointment! The Server did not suggest any items to try The Server did not ask us is we wanted a Appetizer The Server did not ask us is we wanted a Salad The atmosphere was noisy  The Server did not ask us if we were celebrating anything We had to ask for Salad and bread The food was bland The Cheesecake Factory has lost its way... Or at least this location! Very disappointed! Good food and good service is a must for a restaurant to stay in business
Michelle M.,"Phoenix, AZ",1387,232,4130,3.0,10/12/2017,"I don't come to The Cheesecake Factory often but when I do, I always enjoy myself. The food is pretty consistent from one of their restaurants to another and this location was no exception. Came here on a dinner date sometime between 4-5 pm. Parking was hard to find, so had to park toward the very back.  When we stepped into the restaurant we thought we'd be waiting around for a long time since there were lots of people waiting to be seated, but we were surprised to be seated immediately. We were seated close to the kitchen where it was super loud. Kept hearing things being dropped on the floor.  Our waitress came by quickly and took our drink order, brought it back quickly along with some fresh warm bread with butter. I love the dark bread that they bring out. Not sure what kind it is, but it was soft and has a bit of a sweet taste to it. Their sourdough bread was hard and dry, barely edible! After about 10 minutes she came back to take our food order.  I ordered the Crispy Beer Battered Fish tacos that came with 3 street tacos, rice, and black beans. The tacos were delicious, but not much to them. Each taco had a small piece of fish, avocado, tomatoes, onions, cilantro and a chipotle sauce. Rice was good, well cooked and seasoned. I think it was a cilantro rice, but can't certain about that. Black beans were tasty as well. Cost $15.50. My guest got the Fettuccini Alfredo. The noodles were well cooked, not overcooked or undercooked. The sauce was tasty, however, it wasn't anything special. It tasted like something you could've gotten at the store. They did give plenty of sauce on the noodles. This cost $16.95. We planned on getting some cheesecake to go, but when we left, the line for ordering cheesecake was super long.  Pros: 1. Our waitress was nice. 2. Food was good. 3. Nice location and easy to find. 4. Large menu to choose from. Cons: 1. Too busy at this location. 2. The waitress came by only once during the time we were there. She seemed overwhelmed with the number of tables she had to attend to.  3. Prices keep going up on their food. The main reason why I don't come often. For two people, without getting drinks or dessert costs over $30 plus tip and we didn't even get the ""expensive"" items on the menu.  4. Very loud. It was so loud at dinner time that I could hardly hear myself think, let alone hear what my date had to say. There were noises from the kitchen, the staff singing Happy Birthday 3 times, kids and babies crying and screaming, and then just the normal noise of people talking.  Prices and how loud this place was, making my dining experience not as nice is what makes my review a 3 star instead of a 4 star."
Neil M.,"Phoenix, AZ",80,69,415,3.0,10/13/2017,"Let me start off saying that the parking situation at this location sucks! For the amount of people that come here, they need to add more parking. I had to park all the way in the back on a Saturday afternoon. Once I got inside, there were at least 20 people waiting to be seated and the place looked like every available table was taken up. How I love The Cheesecake Factory, but the wait line is always so long!!! Once I was seated I had to wait for about 10 minutes before my waitress came around to even take my drink order. I knew she was very busy, so I just ordered a water. Once she came back with my drink and brought me some bread, she took off again to tend to more tables. After about another 10 minutes she came back and took my food order. I got the Fettuccine Alfredo. Delicious, but cost $17 which to me wasn't worth it as it was just basic and nothing special about it. I could have made it at home for way less.  Other than the food, my experience wasn't the best. The place was so loud I couldn't hear myself think. There were screaming kids, pots and pans banging around in the kitchen and just your average noise of people talking in a crowded space. The staff were slow at coming to tables and checking up on people and for some reason, when I was getting ready to leave, there were 5 tables beside me that were empty and tons of people waiting to be seated! Come on, fill those tables up!!"
Cazoshay W.,"Peoria, AZ",525,16,28,5.0,1/6/2018,"I'm surprised that this location of the Cheesecake Factory only has an overall star rating of 3. The food has always been delicious and the customer service wonderful. The greeters and servers are always pleasant and helpful. I've ordered many different dishes here (ranging from French Toast to Biscuits and Gravy) and everything I've had tasted great and was made to order. The layout is a little congested without a whole lot of room to maneuver around between tables, but that's not a big deal. The connected shop is great too with lots of quality items including clothing (for adults and kids), home goods, decorations, toys and vintage candies. I would definitely recommend this Cheesecake Factory location to others."
K P.,"Bridgeport, CT",0,3,,5.0,1/6/2018,"Great service, food was good, my plate was plentiful (pasta napoletana), but my wife had a problem finding her chicken (Thai coconut chicken) . The wait for a table wasn't bad considering the time 5:45 pm. Our waitress was friendly attentive, and knew the menu. Will definitely return and recommend. Our waitress was Megan S by the way"
Brady M.,"Surprise, AZ",32,144,133,5.0,12/30/2017,We really like Cheesecake Factory. The food is great Â although a bit pricey. And the cheesecake is delicious. It gets really crowded on weekends and pretty much every night of the week. Still worth the wait.
Kemlyn B.,"Glendale, AZ",411,510,1840,4.0,3/22/2017,"Delicious food, pretty ambiance and rich flavors. As a part of our Spring Break food vacation, my daughter and I used a gift card that a friend treated me to last year. We decided to enjoy a three course lunch and split our meal because we knew we'd be too full if we had our own entree.  Our server, Paisley checked on us a couple of times while we waded through the long menu. We had a hard time deciding so we started backwards. We chose the white chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake. Then we ruled out steak and fish for a pasta dish. We considered the mini crab cakes, burger sliders and spring roll sampler, but after choosing the Pasta Carbonara, we decided that a lighter starter would complement the meal better. Our server came back with warm dark wheat loaf with oatmeal and ciabatta bread with real butter. Yummy! My daughter wisely cautioned, ""Don't fill up on bread, Mom! We will have a lot of food coming."" Our server brought fresh extra plates for us to share our salad and pasta. The Caesar Salad was terrific. The lettuce and croutons were crisp. Our server ground fresh pepper on our salad. The dressing was spicy and made from scratch. They were also generous with the Parmesan cheese. Our second course was the Pasta Carbonara. The chunky bacon was crisp and still had a nice bite and chew to it. It was smoky and cut through the creamy garlic Parmesan sauce that was a slight heavy on the olive oil. Still, it was super delicious. I enjoyed the green peas and the pasta was cooked beautifully al dente. Tip: While grilled chicken could be added to either the Caesar Salad or the Pasta Carbonara, I have learned that chicken does not always enhance the flavors of these lovely dishes. I did not regret not adding chicken this time. The dressing was the star of the salad, as was the smoky bacon in the pasta. Finally, our dreamy cheesecake came out with an extra mound of whipped cream. The raspberry ribbon was tart and refreshing. The chocolate base had a nice dark chocolaty flavor. The cake was exactly what a chilled cheesecake should be. Of course, it was dressed with fresh shavings of white chocolate. The company was great. The restaurant was quiet enough for me to enjoy our table conversation. The food was surprisingly good especially a chain restaurant. Our server was attentive. I enjoyed my meal and would not mind repeating it soon. Our tab for our 3 course shared meal was $33. Thank you, Paisley and Cheesecake Factory!"
Christopher B.,"Phoenix, AZ",22,186,444,5.0,1/29/2017,"Last weekend, I had an opportunity to enjoy another meal with some very close friends at the Cheesecake Factory in Peoria. I'm not a stranger to this chain. I'm sure I can count the number of visits to this and other locations on more than two hands. It's been maybe a year since my last meal at a Cheesecake Factory. Last Saturday evening I arrived ahead of my company and the parking lot was full. The lobby was even worse! So when I put my name down for three and was told the wait would be only 30 minutes, I was surprised. And when they paged me to seat us after only 20 minutes, I was shocked. First available, on the patio next to a heat lamp, thank you very much! Cheesecake Factory has a reputation for having a notoriously HUGE menu. The upside is, they have something that appeals to nearly everyone. And I can honestly say, no matter what I was craving while at a Cheesecake Factory from Chandler Fashion Square to Arrowhead, I've always been highly impressed. This meal was no exception. I wasn't feeling very hungry and I wanted something a little healthier than my usual fare. My friend Alex recommended the White Bean Chicken Chili. Knowing that my company eat here more than I do, I took the recommendation. It was the perfect entree for a cold night in January. Not to mention healthy and filling. I was very impressed with the other items on their lighter menu too. Besides consistently delicious meals, the Cheesecake Factory also delivers them with excellent service in a classy environment. Clearly, from the clogged parking lot to the overflowing lobby, I'm not the only one who thinks so."
Reinhardt H.,"Phoenix, AZ",8,71,27,4.0,11/6/2017,"Very nice place. Service tends to be very good. In fact, cheesecake factory hold the position of having the best waiter I have ever had. Turns out he was one of their trainers. The food has always been solid. Consistent. Tastes great. The crusted chicken Romano is fantastic. The sauce on the noodles hits the perfect balance of flavour. Fried Mac and cheese is a nice appy. It is a bit on the pricy side, but I guess you get what you pay for."
Donna D.,"Phoenix, AZ",9,18,79,1.0,10/16/2017,"Do yourself a favor and do not come here. Do not waste your time and money. Not worth either.  Food is mediocre at best and I've been to other locations and they ALWAYS fell short. The free bread Â and water was the only thing good. But anyways, this experience was by far one of the worst.  I came to celebrate my graduation with my bf and he has never been to The Cheesecake Factory. I kinda warned him that it wouldn't be the best food and that everything was overpriced but I just wanted him to experience it and the cheesecake is usually pretty good (as one would hope right).  He ordered a burger well-done and it came out extremely pink inside but somehow the outside of the patty was incredibly charred. I ordered the jambalaya with pasta and the pasta was incredibly overcooked. As I pulled on the noodles they stuck together and tore apart. I had a couple bites and it was mush. The protien was good, the chicken and shrimp but the pasta was unpalatable.  I am just so disappointed about the dining experience. Didn't come in expecting much but didn't expect it to be THAT bad. The manager was completely cooperative and even said straight up that he can tell we weren't enjoying our experience. He and the waitress insisted they could have the food redone but I just wanted to leave!! He ended up comping us for the two entrees. I was not gonna pay $20 for a a plate of mush noodles and my bfs Â $15 burger that was almost raw inside. Even the appetizer we got was not worth $6. Lol truffle bacon cheese sticks. Basically a sandwich with a thin peice of cheese and bacon cut up into 5 pieces.  Still left a tip. Not a great one but still a tip nonetheless. Overall, was a complete waste of time and I'm not one to complain like that but i was so disappointed I wanted to just get up and leave. Wish I would have taken a picture but I didn't even think to. Like I said, the manager was very kind about the whole situation, so props to him! How The Cheesecake Factory is still in business is beyond me."
Mark L.,"Phoenix, AZ",20,42,4,1.0,10/21/2017,I ordered a burger well done and received a cheese burger medium rare. Sent it back as it was wrong next burger comes out with no cheese which is good but the burger is still rare. Sent it back again and this time a manager comes out with the burger and said here you go I cut into it and it is still mooing at me... and the mgr decides to become argumentative with me telling me that this is well done.  I explain that most burgers that have No pink inside is well done this has pink in it which makes it medium to medium rare. Needless to say will not be going there again.
Jenna M.,"Phoenix, AZ",30,3,1,3.0,10/21/2017,"I have been going to TCF for over 12 years in Scottsdale at Kierland. Never disappointed. We got the fish tacos, fried shrimp platter and 2 slices of cheesecake.  The fish tacos were extremely disappointing from this location. I've had them at Kierland and they were great. One of my tacos was 80% fried batter. Â They did not give me limes like every picture has from this place, disappointing because there was a lack of flavor on the actual tacos. Only finished them because I added Cholula from home. The fried shrimp platter was decently sized buy another disappointment, Â they use regular fries and Kierland uses shoestring fries which make all the difference. Next , on the tacos I asked for no beans because I have an allergy and if I could just have double rice. I only got one serving of rice. About 3/4c size. For 16$ the tacos were a huge disappointment. Considering we drove from the Cave creek area to Glendale to pick it up I guess my standards were the standards I have at the Scottsdale location. The shrimp platter 4/5 stars, even ordering extra cocktail sauce, the 2 small containers weren't enough 18$. Â Fish tacos 16$ 3/5 , size, over breaded, no limes, no sour cream ,no chipotle sauce like the menu says and small rice portion . I guess I expected what I saw from other reviews in pictures, the burned tortillas and lack or toppings just made the fish dry and lack in flavor. Cheesecakes 4/5  These are definitely smaller sizes than I've had at Scottsdale and in Boulder,Colorado. Same prices. Just smaller portions .  Total bill 53$ . Overpriced for what you get."
A P.,"Peoria, AZ",0,28,55,4.0,10/19/2017,"My family enjoys the food at this Cheesecake Factory. We always order the Thai Lettuce wraps with grilled chicken satay, fresh vegetables, curry noodles & their 3 dipping sauces (peanut, sweet tamarind & cilantro). All the ingredients combined creates a explosion of flavors with every bite ! My family sometimes order one of their burgers with a side of sweet potato fries & of course a side of ranch dip for the fries. And, of course their cheesecake is always delicious! Service is a hit or miss at this location & their free bread Â is sometimes hard/cold."
Juan M.,"Chandler, AZ",1416,1110,17405,5.0,4/30/2017,"Great experience today with the food and service. Chilaquiles are only served in Sunday when they offer brunch. Chilaquiles were way better than expected. The fried mac and cheese always delivers. Our waitress, Ashley M, was awesome. Friendly, efficient and didn't over/under check in on us. For dessert, we ordered the hazelnut crunch cheesecake and Linda's Chocolate cake. Both awesome. Linda's Chocolate cake is extremely rich (good thing)."
Daniel A.,"Vaughan, Canada",7,42,47,4.0,7/3/2017,"This was my first-ever visit to The Cheesecake Factory. This place seems to get mixed reviews, but I thought it was pretty solid, especially for a place that tries to do it all. Usually, I get worried when a restaurant has 20 pages of items on the menu because let's face, there's no way they can get them all right. But my shrimp & sausage lunch pasta was decent and the cheesecake was rich and delicious. Not bad, not bad at all."
Royce K.,"Phoenix, AZ",7,348,592,3.0,10/1/2017,Just another key chain with mediocre food mediocre service try the mushroom burger it wasn't too bad ordered it medium came out medium which is always a good thing smothered mushrooms and swiss not we'll just see but still pretty good not the best burger I've ever had not the worst either no average Burger had a side Caesar salad that suck Shredder butt is so small you can barely pick it with a fork and their Caesar dressing no flavor at all like I said everything's mediocre but restaurant that's open late night it's not bad better than Denny's yet more expensive than Denny's I prefer BJ's over Cheesecake Factory though may go back to the future and maybe maybe not who knows
Dexter S.,"Flatbush, Brooklyn, NY",0,2,2,1.0,9/28/2017,"I took my wife and two children out for dinner at this location on 09/26/17.  The server was pleasant and attentive. The restaurant was immaculate in appearance as expected.  The (MAJOR) problem was (unfortunately) the food.  My wife ordered us the buffalo wings appetizer.  When they arrived at our table the presentation was spot on, however, when we bit into the wings we were both disgusted by the fact that the wings were RAW on the inside. Now, let me be clear, when I say they were RAW; they weren't slightly undercooked, they were DRIPPING WITH BLOOD!!! We immediately brought it to the attention of our server whom, by the way, was just as shocked and disgusted as we were.  She was very apologetic and she politely gave us two options, order a different appetizer, or, she could put in a new order for freshly COOKED wings.  We opted for the latter, as we assumed it was just an oversight by the preparer/cook. Unfortunately, the second order was not very different from the first order.  How hard is it to cook some wings??? The server was made aware of the fact that the the second set of wings were STILL undercooked. (An assessment that she, too, shared.  She advised us that she would bring the matter to her managers attention.  Ultimately, she removed the wings from our bill.  I was surprised that the MOD (manager on duty) NEVER came over to our table to apologise to us. Â There is NO DOUBT in my mind, that that is POOR MANAGEMENT. Next issue: Both my wife and I each ordered a rib eye steak for our entree', BOTH COOKED MEDIUM TEMPERATURE.  My Rib Eye steak arrived OVER COOKED. My wife's Rib Eye steak arrived cooked perfectly MEDIUM.  There is nothing worse than people seated in the same party ordering identical meals, cooked the same way, served differently!!  I WAS LEFT TO COVET MY WIFES STEAK, and we all know what the Bible says about coveting.  To make matters worse, that night, I was sick ALL throughout the night! I was in the bathroom (like the famous song of Lionel Ritchie says) all night long.  There is NO question in my mind that it was the bloody buffalo wings that made me sick.  We have eaten at this particular Cheesecake Factory on numerous occasions. This was the 1st time that the food made me SICK.  I implore the kitchen manager, general manager, assistant managers, and food expediter(s) to PLEASE, MAKE SURE THAT FOOD IS COOKED PROPERLY.  SERVING RAW CHICKEN CAN BE FATAL."
Safaa I.,"Glendale, AZ",10,2,1,4.0,12/12/2017,"This is probably my favorite CheeseCake Factory location. We went on Saturday so it was a long wait, but our server made the night go smoothly as possible. Our server was Steve, he was amazing. He made sure that everything was good. :)"
Brian P.,"Surprise, AZ",1,50,,5.0,10/4/2017,"My gf and I had the absolute best experience the day after labor day!!! We had the chicken nugget appetizer, perfect small size and sooooo good! I had one of the special pastas. AMAZING!!! Seriously, one of the best pasta dishes I've ever had. She had fish tacos?!? LOL She liked them a lot. Not what I go to Cheesecake for. But had enough pasta, didn't need to share. :D Server was spot on! Food was hot, timely, and very pleasantly delivered! Very impressed, especially after being disappointed from the Scottsdale location. Great job Cheesecake Arrowhead, we loved our dinner experience that night!!!"
Joyce D.,"Phoenix, AZ",10,19,14,5.0,9/8/2017,"Came here at around 1pm on a Friday afternoon. Not crowded at all and was seated right away. Ordered avocado egg roll for appetizer and had 'Evelyn's Favorite Pasta' as my main. Ordered my pasta from their lunch special which is just a smaller portion off of their regular menu and for this particular one, it was only $2 less than regular. However, I thought the portion was still pretty good and I even had leftovers. Our server Jesse was attentive & came back twice to fill up our drinks. Would come back."
James E.,"Glendale, AZ",57,2,,1.0,11/20/2017,This used to be a really good place to come but the past 3 times I've come here it's been horrible. Just left the place right now because I waited 15 minutes for someone to take my order and no one came. The place was not busy at all. The last time I was here they brought out our appetizers with our entree's and the food was all cold and didn't look good at all. I'm a fan of Cheesecake Factory but not this location. They could care less about their customers. Save yourself the headache and go somewhere else.
Don M.,"Prescott, AZ",24,11,1,3.0,11/9/2017,"Been coming to Cheesecake Factory for at least 20 years. Â Have always enjoyed the food and ambiance. Â My problem is that they have changed the variety and quality of their wines. Â  Only a couple of types of wine and the choices were not good. Â Wines that generate a lot of profit because of the low cost. The Beringer that my wife just had literally burned going down her throat. Â I sampled it and she was correct. Â Not what I would expect at this type of restaurant. Â Also, while I'm ranting, how about an IPA on tap?"
Lily W.,"Surprise, AZ",1015,61,500,5.0,6/10/2017,"Been here many times. But since I consider doing Yelp just recently, it's gonna be my first making reviews on this Â place.  This restaurant has always been excellent (for me) it's one of my favorite restaurant  Well, I am just soo easy to please. As long as the restaurant has any of the following: 1.) Not just serve good food but delightfully great food! 2.) Server is fast, attentive to the needs of the customers Â and has a cheerful attitude  3.)the overall appearance of the restaurant is clean 4.)restrooms that are clean. This one got those. My favorite thing also is the bread and butter..I love the rye bread that they serve, it's so yummy!  And lastly, who doesn't like their cheesecakes? YUM!!! That seals the deal LOL We went here today with our friends. And we are more than satisfied! I usually order the Chargrilled New York Steak..it's perfectly done the way I wanted! It's really MASARAP!! (delicious)  Keep it up!"
Kat S.,"Phoenix, AZ",36,95,2,4.0,7/17/2017,"Why is it so loud in here? It seemed like I could hear people's conversations that were sitting in the front near the bar, but we were all the way against the back wall. Dishes clanking, slamming of whatever it was in the kitchen. Ugh! I don't mind noise, I'm loud and I have kids who are never quiet...but, omg this place is loud.  The food is always good and I loooove their passion fruit iced tea. I had the always amazing chicken Madeira, and the hubs had fish and chips. Both were quite good and the portion size definitely wasn't lacking. We finished up with a piece of s'mores cheesecake which sent us both right in to food coma. Service was okay. Our waiter had zero personality and seemed to be overwhelmed with his section.  But, the food was so good that I kind of looked past this."
Sean G.,"Phoenix, AZ",38,15,4,5.0,7/7/2017,I had their coconut curry chicken off of new Menu. Awesome!! But probably too spicy for 85% of your guests. Ask for destiny . She is great.
Stefanie P.,"Surprise, AZ",51,114,157,4.0,10/22/2016,"We've been here many times over the years. I like the large selection of food to choose from. Salads, burgers, pasta, tacos, burritos, sandwiches, meatloaf, Indian inspired... pretty much anyone should be able to find something here. A lite menu that is extensive and vegetarian options. I love the ""bang bang chicken and shrimp"" (chicken, shrimp and veggies in a delicious peanut sauce topped with rice and toasted coconut), their burgers and ceasar salad with grilled salmon. They have a salad with a wide variety of julienne cut veggies that is really good. I've had chicken tacos and have been pleased. I can't think that I've ever been unhappy with my meal there. My kids and husband are always happy too. To drink, I like the iced green tea with mint leaves. Ok, the important part... CHEESECAKE! My personal favorites are the Oreo cheesecake and the Adam's Favorite (a delicious peanut butter and chocolate fudge cheesecake). I've also had the pumpkin pecan cheesecake Â (the crust is too hard, we got this on our last visit and weren't impressed), red velvet cheesecake, carrot cake cheesecake, white chocolate raspberry... probably others too. I mean, it's cheesecake, how bad can it be? Usually the cheesecake does not disappoint.  The service can be hit or miss. We are usually happy, but last night our server just really didn't seem like he wanted to be there and we didn't get great service because of it. Also, I don't like when we are seated at a small table adjacent to other tables (one side shares a long booth type bench), I feel that it lacks privacy because we can hear everything that is being discussed by the parties on either side of us. It's distracting. Not ideal for our ""date night"" which we don't get very often."
Paula E.,"Phoenix, AZ",222,598,1189,5.0,3/28/2017,What's not to love about the Cheesecake Factory? With their menu of choices under 550 calories everyone can find something to love. And who doesn't enjoy cheesecake. Our server was delightful and the meal well paced. A bit pricey depending on what you get but worth it.
Anaiss R.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,3,1,1.0,12/31/2017,"Came here last night to celebrate a loved ones birthday, we had a party of 7 adults 1 child. The lobby was very packed with guests waiting to be seated so we knew it would be a bit of a wait but we ended up waiting to be seated for over an hour and a half. We saw families that arrived after us dine and leave even before we were seated. Food and service from waitress was good, once we were done with our meals we asked to speak to a manager. Matt came over to talk to us and as we expressed how upset we were over the waiting time he, instead of being apologetic, was very argumentative and defensive saying how that is ""normal"" for large parties. All we were hoping for was for a sincere apology since the hostess manager Brad failed to do so and to top it off didn't even seem to care that we were standing there waiting that whole time. As we were leaving three hours after arriving Brad walked past us and all he did was look at us and looked at his watch, that could of been his second opportunity to apologize for the wait time but he didn't. If you plan to come here with a large party please take your business elsewhere or be prepared to wait a long time without even being acknowledged that you're there. Will not be coming to this cheesecake factory again."
Dana J.,"Surprise, AZ",0,14,3,2.0,10/22/2017,"Last time I came here I was not happy I was told I could seat any where in the bar area so me and my husband did thAn we were ask to move cause the seats on the wall in the BAR area are regular seats I guess no one said that so we went and sat at the bar I ask for a lemon drop Martini and they suck too the bartender that really can't speak English suck on making a lemon drop Martini sad part we order total of 4 drinks and one Appetizer and our bill was 85 never again will I go back they suck too ,charge too much money and can't get my drink right"
S A J.,"Phoenix, AZ",1,2,1,2.0,7/12/2017,Very slow service. Made us late for an appointment. It would have been nice to know why the service was so slow prior to requesting to speak with the manager.  The turkey burger was juicy but lacked flavor
Jez D.,"Deer Valley Village, Phoenix, AZ",0,4,,1.0,10/18/2017,"I typically love The Cheesecake Factory, but lately their service is terrible. Last Saturday my husband and I ate there around 9pm. We had a nice, older, dark haired lady as our server. She was friendly, but absolutely clueless. First sge brought out loaded potato soup and forgot the bacon. We waited 10 minutes for the bacon and the soup was cold. Then I had a bbq burger and she forgot the sweet potato fries, so I was left to wait 10 minutes for fries and by then my husband had finished his catfish. Needless to say, I ate alone while my husband waited for me to eat. This all happened after already waiting 30 minutes for our food, even though the place was dead! The only positive things I can say is that I enjoyed the Strawberry Creamsicle and potato soup. This restaurant is too overpriced for the lack of good customer service."
Domo H.,"Phoenix, AZ",126,45,81,4.0,7/7/2017,"We've been to this location several times in the last two years. It is pretty inconsistent. Sometimes it's amazing, usually it's pretty good, and other times we walk away wondering if we'll be back. Tonight was a pretty good night. We were seated pretty quickly and our waitress came right up to the table and got our drinks started and asked if we wanted bread. A few minutes later she brought water and subsequently the drinks we had ordered and some bread. From the point that she took our food order and when we received it seemed fairly Quick. Everyone was happy with their food, it was seasoned pretty well and everything came out correctly. We ordered our cheesecakes to go and got those fairly quickly too. I was pretty happy with tonight because it was busy but we didn't feel forgotten or like we were a burden to our waitress. There are so many new restaurants around the area so it will probably be a while before we are back, but we aren't taking it off the table of one our favorite restaurants. I love that, like starbucks, no matter which one you go to, it is pretty much consistent."
Lindsay S.,"Surprise, AZ",0,6,,1.0,10/15/2017,"My husband and I went out for our 16th wedding anniversary. Â Now we do not go out often, we don't have a lot of extra money so eating out is a treat we do on special occasions, kids birthdays etc...so this was a big deal. Â Ordered the fried Calamari, greasy and rubbery. Â Bread was hard. Â I ordered the Pasta Carbonara with grilled shrimp...$23. Â It was so greasy and the shrimp were rubbery. Â This was the first time I've ever sent food back. Â My husband ordered the steak tacos, they were cold. Â Since he was so hungry, he ate them anyway but regretted it later that night. Â The only good thing was Diane A. our waitress was amazing. Â Hopefully she got to keep the whole tip! Â So much for a romantic anniversary dinner without the kiddos!"
Mia A.,"Phoenix, AZ",15,9,16,2.0,11/25/2017,"I had the crab bites and they were okay, nothing too impressive and I had the loaded baked potato soup which was really bad. My girlfriend had a cucumber mojito and it had too much mint and the mint leaves were going bad. Same thing with the green leaves in the salads. The two people I was with ordered different salads. Both were crap. Someone ordered a burger and that was apparently good but the person that said that doesn't have very high standards for burgers. Not worth the money."
Katie M.,"Glendale, AZ",232,182,225,3.0,8/8/2016,So living in the Glendale area I have now given this Cheesecake Factory two chances I'm a sucker for Cheesecake Factory.. I love eating at cheesecake factory I love their food I love their bread and especially the cheesecakes  But for some reason this location has now disappointed me twice. Total bummer bc well my fiancÃ© and our kids love coming here a.k.a. they love the bread lol!  So we first went to this location two weeks ago.. We were a huge party of 10 which was fine Â you know it was dinner time no complaints on our waiter... I ordered the chicken lettuce wraps or as they call them lettuce tacos. Nothing taco about only taco thing was it came out in the weird taco holder stand..this is where I don't understand what happen I ordered chicken lettuce wraps I would expect there to be chicken in my lettuce wrap not one little sliver of chicken probably 1 inch long I want chicken I'm hungry! So already I'm disappointed. We came back here the other night and our kids food(they get the kids pizza) was fine my fiancÃ©'s food was phenomenal(he usually gets the steak or salmon) and my food again not so great. I ordered the Parmesan crusted chicken which I've ordered at other Cheesecake factory's and I've never had this issue that my chicken crusted Parmesan was soggy. Usually it's thin crispy not this one soggy like it was old and warmed up ... Crazy part is I know not to order those items again bc I know we will be back... Just I know for next time.. Anyway I still love Cheesecake Factory.. Just beware of soggy chicken lol
Bob S.,"Buckeye, AZ",0,10,1,4.0,10/2/2017,First time in a long time at the cheesecake factory and i was very pleased with my lunch. Service was perfect and the food was plentiful and delicious. Would be 5 stars if not for the prices. Ouch.
Brad D.,"Surprise, AZ",255,48,107,5.0,10/26/2016,"I've never had a bad experience here. Professional staff, great atmosphere and delicious food! I use to think the menu (roughly 8+ pages) and variety of cuisines was too much but that's gone out the window. Whenever I'm indecisive on what I'm craving, I'll go here and have a great selection. They even have a skinny licious menu if your cutting down on calories! I have to commend the all around service you get here. Very professional! The servers have years of experience and it shows. The GM, Chad, is awesome and is always a pleasure to see.  What I like and recommend... Appetizers: stuffed mushrooms, chicken samosas, crab bites, and the ahi carpaccio. Entrees: Â hibachi steak, Jamaican black pepper shrimp, miso salmon, French dip and Evelyn's favorite pasta!  Dessert: chocolate chip cookie dough, pumpkin cheesecake and the salted caramel."
Jerry R.,"Mesa, AZ",5,24,,2.0,2/18/2017,"I have been to many other Cheesecake Factory locations in the past and they were all amazing. This location has some issues. THE PORTION SIZES ARE SO SMALL! I got stuffed mushrooms and they are usually about the size of quarters or larger. These were the size of dimes and burned. I returned them and asked for a fresh plate. The next plate they were very small and dry. Just nowhere near the size or quality I expedited, so I returned them. The manager came and apologized and asked if he could anything to make it better. My wife'se tacos were very small as well, and the tortillas were not the same as the ones used at other locations. Our friend that went along with us said her sandwhich was also very small. Server n didn't bring out bread. Lame. Great manager, but I won't return. I'll stick with the Chandler Mall."
