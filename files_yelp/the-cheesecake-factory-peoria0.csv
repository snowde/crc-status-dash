Steven B.,"Glendale, AZ",0,1,,1.0,12/28/2014,"Average to poor food. I've had orange chicken, a salad, and chicken enchiladas. They all sucked. They all cost more then they should have."
Vicki M.,"Orange, CA",0,90,3,5.0,3/15/2015,"It's the Cheesecake Factory, what else can you write????  Excellent food, fantastic cheesecake selection. This is always one of our destinations on our frequent, yearly visits to Sun City, Arizona. Everyone finds plenty to choose from and the food is ALWAYS excellent."
Charelle A.,"Peoria, AZ",2,15,11,1.0,10/14/2014,Very disappointed with meal & service!  Shrimp over cooked & tough. Charged $2.95 for each ice tea which is outrageous then charged for refills.We definitely will not be back. The service was terrible.  Slow very slow
Ian S.,"Phoenix, AZ",46,177,6,3.0,6/26/2013,"If you're not familiar with the Cheesecake Factory, the name should imply that their menu is full of flavorful high-calorie offerings. But it may not imply so well that this place is rather expensive-- on the border of outlandishly. However, their menu is extremely robust, I don't think I can recall another restaurant with so many different things on their menu. Their cheesecake is outstanding, of course, but some of their other menu items can be hit or miss. (For example, their Buffalo Blasts are not as good as they sound, but everything else we tried was rather decent) It's a good place to go for a special occasion, I can't really say don't go-- but for the same (or less) money I can get higher quality at other places."
Valerie D.,"Glendale, AZ",0,3,3,2.0,6/27/2015,"All the tables were dirty and greasy. Silverware was filmy and the menus greasy. Wondered why there were 4 plus waiters just standing around yapping their mouths when they could have been wiping menus, cleaning tables or anything to help improve the ambience.  Won't be returning."
Gueu S.,"Phoenix, AZ",1,8,2,1.0,5/2/2015,Waiting from last 10 mins...nobody even served a glass of water...trust me this place is not even crowded...yucks
Sarah B.,"Glendale, AZ",0,6,,5.0,2/22/2016,"great restaurant! love to come here to celebrate special occassions (birthdays, graduations , etc) with friends and family. Food is always good, and service is excellent! We celebrated my son's birthday Feb. 6th of this year, 2016 and we enjoyed the food and appreciate good , professional, attentive service .My family, and friends will sure comeback again, and again! Keep up the good work, Cheesecake Factory!!! yeay!"
Aaron T.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,5,1,1.0,3/16/2016,Ordered their turkey avacado sandwich off their Skinnylicious menu. It may be a healthy menu but you think the waiter would have the common sense to alert a relatively large guy that he is ordering a sandwich the size of a Hawiian roll. $12 and I'd expect something bigger than a portion size for a toddler.
Susan R.,"Peoria, AZ",8,7,,1.0,3/26/2015,"My niece found a piece of glass in her French fries - we told the waitress, and she told the manager - and it took him 15 minutes to come over to see if she was ok - no apologies - we had a party of 10 - and the bill was over $272 - they just didn't seem to be concerned at all - very poor customer satisfaction at this place.  We have been there for the past 3 years for my mother's birthday - and this is the last time we will ever go there - any of my family - and we will be telling everyone about this!  Totally unacceptable."
Christina P.,"Glendale, AZ",2,16,,2.0,1/18/2016,At lunch and my plate comes out with hair on it. I mention this to our server and she asks if I want my food remade. I'm not sure why I was even asked this question?!? This among a long list of other things that went wrong. Won't be back.
Dawn G.,"Cypress, CA",36,31,21,2.0,9/25/2014,Ok went Saturday at lunch time not to busy . We were seated quickly. That's when it all went wrong. The waitress was to busy talking to get our drink orders we waited about 8 minutes for her to quit talking to another employee to come over. We did get our drinks waited another 10 minutes  for her to come back and get our order. Everyone around us was given bread we had to ask twice before she remembered to bring it. Someone else brought out the food . It was good. But never got a refill or did she check to see of we needed anything else . Then when we she brought the check we ask about dessert she said u want it Togo . We said no then she was like oh ok . Then she dropped food on the floor and just kicked it out of the was hoping someone else would pick it up. Spook with manager on the way out he apologized.
Stephanie L.,"Phoenix, AZ",295,71,88,4.0,11/12/2013,"My boyfriend and I were going to be in a completely different part of town that we live in, so naturally, I had to come to yelp to find an eatery that we could patron for lunch while waiting for my vehicle to be detailed.  I initially found a different place to go, but when we arrived there, it was dead and not at all our style of place to dine al fresco.   Thankfully, as we were in the Arrowhead area thus surrounded by various other locations, we had options, so ultimately we agreed on The Cheesecake Factory.  Now, I have to make mention that neither one of us is historically a 'fan' of this place and so therefore hadn't been in a very long time, and never together.  Regardless, we gave it a shot and I'm thrilled to report that we're very pleased that we did.  The overall experience, from greeting to ambiance to service and of course the food were all very good.  We definitely recommend this place for lunch and whenever we find ourselves in that area would absolutely keep them in mind to patron again."
Jamie P.,"Phoenix, AZ",163,111,40,4.0,11/30/2014,"I really enjoyed my meal at Cheesecake factory. I suggest getting the chicken littles. They are tasty. 3 of us ordered them, and we all were very happy with our meal. We also ordered the fried cheese. It was smaller than we had expected. The server was very friendly and attentive. The bread was burned, but she quickly exchanged it out for us. I'll definitely be back."
Russ S.,"Peoria, AZ",0,23,,5.0,1/14/2014,Love this place. Never get tired of it.  Portions are huge Menu is enormous Food tastes great Service is always excellent I cant ask for much more...
Bill J.,"Glendale, AZ",44,173,660,3.0,12/30/2012,"This is another toughie for me to review, for a variety of reasons.  First of all, I like the decor and I like the ambiance of this place. It's not like most of the other restaurants (especially chains) in the area, and while pretentious, it at least outwardly appears fancier than you'd otherwise expect. There's also the lighting and a lot of windows, which is typically a plus in the early evening, so you can catch some of the sunset or watch the wind batting around the palm branches.  Food and service, however, have never really impressed me at this location. I don't know if it is specific to this restaurant or if the entire chain is this way, but after multiple visits, my honest opinion is that their menu is way, way too big. They have immense variety, but as they say, jack of all trades and master of none. Case in point, nothing I have had here has been the best, or even remotely close, compared to what I've gotten elsewhere.  I've tried the pulled pork, but I've had better almost everywhere else. Tried the burgers, but better can be had for far less money elsewhere. Appetizers are pretty much on the same page, things like pot stickers are literally no better than what you can buy in the frozen food section of your grocery store, there was nothing special about them. I've also given their pizza a try and it was some of the worst I've ever had anywhere -horrible, tasteless crust, nasty sauce and cheese that was just.. yuck. I will concede that their dessert menu does offer a few delights that I have been happy with. The milkshakes, and the strawberry one in particular, were always sinfully good. I never could finish them because they were so huge, but at least they were delicious, unlike most of the food I've had there.   In terms of service, there has been a lot of inconsistency in my visits. More often than not, it's below average service, slow drink refills and the like. Really gets my goat when I see the ""drink refill guy"" topping off every table but mine, despite the empty glass on the corner of the table, begging to be refilled. But then, he's not the server, so do you factor this into your tip? This is why I hate when restaurants job-share tables, it puts you in a position to have to punish a good server for a crappy drink service that was someone else's fault. Sigh. Bottom line, I think, is that this place is trying to be too many things at once, with the not at all unexpected result of poor execution. Their menu has to be close to 20 pages, and it really doesn't help that there are paid advertisements in it on every page too. I don't know why they see the need to generate revenue that way, but it reeks of desperation and detracts horribly from the experience of dining in a faux-upscale restaurant, even more so than half-baked service. My advice? Stay away until they slim down the menu and try to specialize, or at least only go for the desserts. The rest of their food is just adequate, at best, and definitely overpriced for what it is. Combined with the unpredictable service, I just don't see any reason to go back here."
Chanda S.,"Phoenix, AZ",3,17,1,1.0,2/7/2016,"Visited this afternoon for my birthday lunch because I LOVE cheesecake. We were seated right away which was nice. After sitting for about 15 minutes and giving our orders I actually had to stop our waitress and ask for some bread and sweetener for my boyfriends tea. That was a little annoying but oh well right? I order two appetizers the sliders and the loaded potato puffs to share with my 1 year old and explain not to bring them out as an appetizer but with my boyfriends entree which was to be a burger and fries. Guess what? Got my appetizers early and my half got cold as I waited for his meal to appear, when it did appear we were told they were waiting on his fries and they would be right out, they never came and instead of following up our waitress walks by,sees he is done with his burger and asks if he would like her to take his plate. In the end the manager took his meal off the check but needless to say I did not stay for my cheesecake nor will I ever return to this joke of a restaurant. I know its not the worst experience but its your job at least put some effort in."
Lidia R.,"Phoenix, AZ",7,12,2,2.0,7/5/2016,We have visited this  cheesecake factory multiple  times for special occasions or quick lunches through out the years. When we first arrived by spouses asked for a table and we were taken right back to be seated no waiting! The only bad part is we were given a booth. This wasn't a deal breaker for me. We made do with what we were given our server came over put napkins down on the table she brought over cups of water and advised us she would be back momentarily to take our drink order. ..20 minutes later we were still waiting. During this time I witnessed our employee stop at a pos station three different time to talk to 3 separate employees. Finally I flagged her down in the midst of trying to provide our drink order she talked over me to ask if that's all we wanted? We did end up ordering food and it was prepared beautifully. The flavors and textures were amazing like they always are. I was just extremely  dissapointed by the customer service. Usually  management  stops over to ask how everything was and for some reason that didn't occur this time around. It didn't seem paticularly too busy  this day. As I advised we (a family of 5) were seated right away and in my opinion if u have time to talk u have time to take orders. I hope our next visit goes better.
Rachelle M.,"Phoenix, AZ",1,7,3,5.0,2/19/2015,An hour and 45 min wait turned into thirty minutes really quickly.  We sat on the table and got swift service.  Barely had to wait long for our food and the rose martini is to die for!  Our waiter was down to earth and professional.  He got our whole order correct and I will be returning to this Cheesecake Factory.  Great food great service!  My advice.  Always go for pastas with this place.  So good.
Davon C.,"Glendale, AZ",0,11,,5.0,4/12/2015,Since they aren't the cheapest I don't go too often but when I do I always get great service and the food is excellent. I think this is the only restaurant I've been to and have not had an issue with the service.
Jessica S.,"Phoenix, AZ",60,60,19,5.0,10/19/2014,"Busy night but still got sat within ten minutes at a nice booth for five. Server was friendly and attentive. All of us ladies enjoyed our food greatly and not one complaint was spoke, that's pretty good with five chics at a table. My chicken was tender and the cheesecake  was amazing. Definitely will be back! Best wings with blue cheese I've ever had as an appetizer!"
