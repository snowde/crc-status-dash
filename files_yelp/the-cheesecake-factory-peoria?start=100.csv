Sher A.,"Peoria, AZ",0,39,5,2.0,11/16/2016,"Ordered 2 pieces of cheesecake for PICK UP. I was fine paying $16 for 2 pieces as I remembered they are a decent size. However, this were TINY PIECES OF CHEESECAKE. So not only are they expensive, but they are smaller in size.  Never ordering cheesecake from there again."
Kelly K.,"Peoria, AZ",54,4,,1.0,12/12/2016,The food was horrible iv been here many times to re try it and I feel like the cooks have no idea how to make that type of food and there r too many choices stick to one thing ur good at and keep it that way it seems low rank now
Gabbie I.,"Central Business District, Denver, CO",39,2,,1.0,6/7/2017,"I came here for my birthday today, obviously picking it for a special occasion. I ordered the Herb Crusted Chicken and when I got the plate, the chicken was very very bland. I have had a lot of chicken in my day, but that has to rank as one of the worst. The mashed potatoes and green beans were also very cold. The silverware also had food stuck on it when we got ours. The star is for the waiter who was very nice. Very disappointed and will not return ."
Michelle W.,"Peoria, AZ",229,118,74,4.0,4/4/2015,"I only come here for their cheesecake, calamari, and bread. These are the only yummy things they have. The 4 star rating is for the above alone, and for the great service I always get. The actual food...please, if you want good food, don't come here. They have a big selection of overpriced food items you and your family and friends can choose from. I went last night with a $50 gift card and got shrimp scampi, buffalo blast, and a moscow mule. Shrimp Scampi-$20- breaded shrimp that was all soggy when it came out. The shrimp itself was pretty big but all dried up and had no juicyness or bouncyness in them. I usually love shrimp, but I had two of these and couldn't handle anymore. The angel hair pasta was alright... Buffalo Blast-$10- big portion for an appetizer! But way overcooked, and most of it is just breading anyways.  Moscow Mule-$10-for a moscow mule?! It better be good. Well, it wasn't. It was so sweet and I did not taste a bit of alcohol.  I've been here many times when I was young to celebrate many achievements in life, and I've had the food here many times. When I grew up and started paying for my own food, I ended up coming here for their 3 things I mentioned above. I had wondered why I never ordered their entrees here, and yesterday's dinner reminded me why."
Adriana C.,"Litchfield Park, AZ",6,93,68,1.0,2/27/2017,"Came here for my birthday party and I will not ever be coming back with a large group.  Problem #1: I called two weeks in advance and was told they don't make reservations for the time I was requesting and to come in 45 min early and I should be fine. I advised them it is a group of 20 and she said it was fine. Okay, so I came in 45 min early (4:15pm) and was quoted an hour by the manager. An hour and a half goes by and we are still waiting. I then speak to the manager and told him he quoted me an hour and it's well over an hour. He apologized and said we were waiting for another large party to leave because that's where we would be sitting and that he would have appetizers waiting for us.  Problem #2: If you are telling people to just walk in with big parties then why don't you just take reservations to avoid getting slammed and you can prepare for it?! COMMON SENSE. Problem #3: You shouldn't wait on a party to leave and expect them to leave in a timely manner because for all we know they can sit there and chat for another hour and you can't force them to leave!   We finally got sat at 6:00 pm. The appetizers did come out about 10 minutes after we got sat which helped a little. The food seemed to take awhile but I get it was a big party, so kind of expected but the problem I had was my mom and little brothers food never came out. I advised the server and she's like it should be out shortly they are finishing up. Ummmm I actually don't even think they put their order in because my whole table was done eating and they were still waiting on their food! The manger came over and apologized AGAIN and said it would be take care of and gave my mom a free slice of cheesecake. I mean that's fine and all but my mom had to take her food to go because we were already there for 3 hours and everyone was ready to leave. Honestly, worst service ever! Never coming here again and will take my large parties somewhere else.  Cheesecake factory should allow reservations all the time. This will help and people will not have to wait foreverrrrr.  OH and the least the manager could of done was give ME a free slice of cheesecake as it was my 25th birthday and we waited almost 2 hours to be sat! Very disappointed."
Andrea S.,"Minneapolis, MN",79,86,,1.0,7/13/2016,I use to really enjoy coming here due to the variety of food on the menu. It's never really been amazing but there's a ton of choices and the cheesecake is amazing. The last time I came here I ordered a piece of banana cheesecake. It tasted slightly off but still good so I assumed it was just me and ate a few bites of it. Later that night I was up and sick from the bad cheesecake I consumed earlier. After that experience I will never come here again.
Drian Z.,"Peoria, AZ",7,28,3,5.0,3/5/2017,just ate here for brunch got the ricotta lemon pancakes best pancakes i ever ate with the buttermilk syrup and softest melting bites wife and i love it would recommend definitely
ken i.,"Rockford, IL",2,73,2,4.0,3/12/2017,We were visiting Phoenix from the Midwest and stopped here for the first time. My wife and I had light meals. She had the beets and goat cheese salad. She loved it! I had the lettuce wrap chicken appetizer as my meal. The wraps were fantastic. The only complaint was the service was slow and not particularly friendly. Our server was not at all apologetic for the slowness. Otherwise it was great!
Mary A.,"Cave Creek, AZ",0,2,,1.0,4/23/2017,"My husband ordered club sandwich, but they were out of turkey. So he ordered the meatloaf with salad  with thousand island dressing. He told waitress it was not thousand island on the salad. Waitress said yes, their thousand island is not like usual thousand island. She could see my husband only ate a little salad, but did not even offer to do anything. Poor customer service...we won't be back!"
Sabrina G.,"Buckeye, AZ",0,32,7,2.0,12/13/2015,"Not a good experience. Do not serve food at your bar if your servers/bartenders can't handle it.  Our bartender was more concerned with his well the whole time then ever worrying about us.  We had to ask for drink refills multiple times.  Didn't care that our whole meal was still on our plates.   The meatloaf was a dense, old, brick like piece of meat.  The herb crusted chicken was extremely dry.  We both ate the mashed potatoes and that was it. Just very unfortunate when spending money for a few drinks and a nice meal that the service and food was terrible."
Sam S.,"Gilbert, AZ",47,215,90,5.0,1/17/2016,"Been here several times.  In fact, this is where my wife and I had our first date.  Always a positive experience."
Regina M.,"El Mirage, AZ",0,30,,3.0,10/10/2016,We had a group of 11 we waited a hour for a table took almost 30 minutes to even order our food I understand it was a Friday night. Although it was busy l thought once we sat down we would understand at least be taken care of But it wasn't that way at all. After we order the food waitress was not to be found for a while. Then it took 20 minutes to bring the ticket. I was very disappointed in the service and the long waits. The food was amazing and that is why I give the stars.
Tommy T.,"Goodyear, AZ",11,21,37,4.0,3/7/2016,This is one of the best of theyre huge nr of locations. Service not that good for the price and comparisons. But the food is always good.Will go again.
Jin W.,"Goodyear, AZ",24,8,5,4.0,8/10/2016,Service was good and cheesecake was good as always. But one thing I always frustrating about thus place is I'm getting same pasta most of times but always little different. This time pasta was not fully cooked.other than that it was alright.
Jim And Wendy A.,"Peoria, AZ",0,27,,4.0,3/30/2017,"My wife and I know we will always get a wonderful meal here. The bread is always fresh. The salads are always made well. Love the booths and overall set-up of the dinning area. The wait is tolerable and worth it. The employees are friendly and efficient. The cheesecake is delicious but we rarely partake because of the price. Thumbs up guys, great restaurant!!"
Sam G.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,43,,4.0,8/29/2016,"Mac and Cheese burger was ok. Not what I was expecting. Service was great. Our waitress, Ashleigh P. was fantastic. Patient and helpful, answered all our questions and was very accommodating. Never felt rushed and she checked on us enough to not be over bearing."
Jade W.,"Goodyear, AZ",18,321,20,2.0,10/7/2015,"My boyfriend had been talking about this ""amazing"" French toast he had at the Cheesecake Factory when he ate there with his family, so we finally made it over there for Sunday brunch. I ordered the Bruleed French Toast and he ordered the Farm Fresh Eggs, scrambled/well, with potatoes, toast, and bacon (meat is extra). We planned to share so we could have a little of everything. I was surprised that they brought out the complimentary bread before our brunch, but it was almost lunchtime. I sure do enjoy the honey oat bread. Sourdough is alright too. When our food came out, I took a bite of the French toast and was instantly turned off by the mushy consistency. It's so thick and, I'm sure, soaked in egg. It was not appetizing to me. My boyfriend offered to switch plates since he'd had it before and liked it, so we did. The eggs were fine and maybe had a little seasoning to them. Most of the potatoes were crunchy, so I was not impressed. The bacon was really dark red in color and very crispy. I don't know if that means it is extra lean?? The toast was really not necessary after all the bread I had just eaten... Overall I was not pleased with this meal, especially for the price! And I had a stomach ache afterwards. There are so many other places I'd prefer to get breakfast food. Our server did not really have a sense of humor either. We did get a couple slices of cheesecake to go, for good measure. Vanilla Bean and Lemon Meringue. Unfortunately the meringue had melted off the top by the time we got it home... The vanilla bean tasted a lot like vanilla ice cream. So it was good, but even half a slice was too much. The lemon meringue was rather tart but the whipped cream helped to balance it out. I've enjoyed other varieties of cheesecake more than these two."
Corrie G.,"Peoria, AZ",108,68,203,3.0,8/19/2015,"I've been here maybe 10 different occasions in the past 2-3 years. I've tried a variety of things, the meatloaf dinner (yum), chicken & biscuit dinner (blah- won't order again, plus the biscuit was a rock), the brunch French toast is a favorite of mine ( yum, it's usually when we go visit), California omelet (on our most recent visit... The avocado was actually guacamole, no cheese on top- only inside- which didn't seem like much at all & I had ordered extra- so that was disappointing. The inside not mixed well, as I went through the omelet, I'd go from one ingredient to another.. Also they don't cut up the cherry tomatoes & I cut into one on my 1st bite into the omelet where a cherry tomato happened to be, which burst and squirted my face & eye, which was painful!)  So overall, I'm not super impressed with this place. It's ok. Dessert to-go or pick-up is good. We love the carrot cake, I've ordered a whole one before. For my husbands 30th birthday. Yum! Also can't wait for the pumpkin cheesecake."
Kristen L.,"Sun City, AZ",42,56,70,4.0,1/10/2016,"I always feel like the food is pretty average for their prices, but they are pretty good portions. Service for todays lunch was quick, we were told a 20 minute wait to be seated but it was more like 5. Our waitress was very attentive, no complaints there. We ordered the artichoke spinach dip for an appetizer, the dip itself was OK, the tortilla chips were a little stale for my taste. My daughter ordered the fish tacos tempura battered, she asked for hard tacos but got soft corn. I had the chicken piccata lunch portion, chicken was tender and still plenty of food for the lunch menu. We were stuffed but still ordered a slice of salted caramel cheesecake to go. I'm sure that's delicious, when is cheesecake not awesome? Almost $80 for lunch is a good reminder why I hardly ever come here though."
Jessica K.,"San Tan Valley, AZ",101,404,50,4.0,11/23/2014,"Stopped in for dinner last night, and we were quickly seated. Standard decor inside/out. We were able to enjoy patio seating which is still warm enough to enjoy in late November with the heaters. Service was outstanding!!  I love their macaroni and cheese ball appetizer, so I get it as a meal. We got a loaded baked potato tot app to share, it was tasty and under $6! All there food is priced a little higher than most, but I think it's still fair. Love the endless bread!! And the strawberry lemonade, despite it being rediculously sweet, is also a must.   Be sure to stop in for lunch - their pizza and salad deals are the best. I do not recommend getting their burgers. They taste burned around the edges (charbroiled I suppose) no matter how you ask for them to be cooked. My husband also doesn't like their new fries."
