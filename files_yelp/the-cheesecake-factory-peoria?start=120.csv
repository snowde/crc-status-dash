Ryan H.,"Yorba Linda, CA",2,2,,2.0,5/21/2016,"Let me start this off by saying the food was AMAZING as always. Now that that's out of the way, I am so completely upset that the recipe to the Banana Cheesecake was changed. It taste like a processed piece of cheesecake you buy from a piggly wiggly dime store. Thank you for allowing me to order it and take it home so excited and happy for the best cheesecake in the world and take a bite of that crap. I am so sad!!!"
Devon S.,"Peoria, AZ",22,5,2,5.0,3/7/2016,Came in with my boyfriend for some dessert and I have to say that coming for years now; nothing has has changed! Same friendly staff--of course not all original--and great food! At least I know where tobgo for some awesome cheesecake. Highly recommended.
Tom W.,"Glendale, AZ",22,5,4,1.0,3/5/2017,"This is the most likely one of the places that i will never return.  The wait was told to get seated was 30 min.  That was 45 minutes.  That was no big deal for the party of 6.  The hostist was nice and polite.  This is where the good times stop.  We sat down and ordered appetizers.  From there we got them to come out at 20 minutes after order.  We also ordered our food at the same time.  It took about 1 hour for our main meal to come out.  When it came out, it was evadent that the plates were held under the heat lamps,  most meals were warm and my childs bowl was the hottest out of the bunch.  The waiters was using a towle to hold the bowl and told us it was hot.  I dont know about you but you would not give a hot plate, where it needs a pot holder to transpor child that is 10.  The meals temp was warm and not hot.  But i guess that is what we get for waiting.  We also has to constantly ask the waiter to refil the drink glasses, remove dishes.  This will be the last time that i will be here."
Lilly S.,"Phoenix, AZ",3,8,26,5.0,2/2/2016,2nd time at this place. The food and service as awesome as the last time I was here. I ordered the chicken Bellagio and It was amazing. Calamari was great as well.. Luv it!! Last visit I ordered the chicken Madeira.  It was soooo goood..
Howard H.,"Phoenix, AZ",3,7,,3.0,7/8/2016,"Fun environment, great staff, very nice Happy Hour and tasty food.  Only sore spot was the value of a glass of Sangria that costs $10.95 in either the ""skinny"" or regular version.  My wife had a glass of each style and we aren't sure that $22 for 2 glasses of wine and fruit is a good value.  It's your call on prices but in our minds that isn't a good deal.  I suspect we will return however you can be certain Sangria won't be included in our next visit."
Bev T.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,28,,2.0,1/3/2017,"The food was great. The service was why I gave this experience a 2 star rating. I had ordered a chopped salad which was supposed to come with grilled chicken. I didn't notice the chicken was missing until I was half done but once I could get the attention of our server, I informed him and told him I was almost done so I didn't want the chicken. He advised he would ""pass it along to management"". I guess I was expecting to see the manager, or a discount on my tab or some sort of adjustment. But nothing. Not a sorry about that, not a nothing. I'm not even sure he mentioned it to his manager. In hindsight, I guess I should have docked his tip, but I didn't. Maybe my standards are too high and I expect too much but I would have liked to have seen better customer service in some way or another."
Edward D.,"Surprise, AZ",791,1051,183,3.0,5/27/2015,"Never been impressed with over priced, not that great food, cheesy servers, Cheesecake Factory. We were there for my daughters birthday. She wanted to come here, so I had to. We had 10 people there. Five foster kids, wife, daughter, her boyfriend, and her boyfriends brother. You can imagine how much the bill was. And for what? Their food has always been famous with the amount of calories in their servings. And you would think their food would be better? NOT! Sorry just not worth, you can get a better value for your dollar elsewhere."
Deg s.,"Avondale, AZ",0,34,,3.0,2/12/2017,We were a party of 6 last Saturday and got sat quickly  at a large table with food on the floor and on one of the chairs   I brought this to the attention of a waiter nearby but rather then have someone come by with a broom he grabbed a napkin off the table and scooped the food up off the floor then used the other end of the napkin to wipe off the chair   The food we ordered was good but just lukewarm. Drink refills were very slow in coming.  Was not the great experience we hoped for but the cheesecake is still the best
Mike L.,"Glendale, AZ",1,35,17,1.0,12/19/2015,"Sub par at best. Wait staff unattentive. Food is totally mediocre. Got served a Moscow mule in a glass. Wth??  This is only my second time eating at a Cheesecake Factory. Once in Cleveland and once here in Peoria. Hopefully I won't ever get suckered into it again! Hate chains. Buy local, people! $ 10.99 for a Moscow mule! In a glass!!"
Glenda E.,"Goodyear, AZ",10,58,49,4.0,10/10/2015,"Only concern was the soda glass my daughter got was broken around the rim, quite dangerous! Our server immediately apologize and brought her a fresh soda. Love the ""skinny menu"" the skinny margarita was very good and under 150 calories!!! Edamame needed some salt they were rather bland. My two 14yr old girls had glam burgers and they were HUGE they could have split one. Very juicy very tasty! Now time for the snickers and dream extreme cheesecake!! I will just be drinking water!! Gotta get in shape!!! Angelica our server was very pleasant and on the ball. I listened to her talk to her tables around us and she was genuinely kind and made sure everyone was enjoying their meals. Sweet girl."
Pat H.,"El Paso, TX",0,2,2,5.0,12/25/2015,First time going. Delicious! I had the skinny burger on my sisters recommendation. The mojito was very good. I could've drank several more. My waitress was very nice. The place is gorgeous. Rumor had it you were coming to my hometown. Please say that it's so. See you all again tomorrow.
Megan R.,"Glendale, AZ",188,162,3,4.0,6/18/2015,"I visit the Cheesecake Factory frequently with my family for birthdays and holidays. The service at this location is always superb and I've never had a bad meal. They are always very accommodating. Another perk about going here is their Skinnylicious menu. Many of their entrees on the regular menu are calorie packed, so the Skinny menu offers many delicious and healthy options for those trying to shed some pounds."
Kaily N.,"Phoenix, AZ",166,60,54,4.0,3/30/2015,"So I'm not usually into Chain Restaurants but I must say, this location always does a great job when I come in. I can't help but love the decor, it reminds me of Vegas.... Don't ask why. I don't know.  The hostesses were all nice, all three of them. Went on a Saturday afternoon with my BFF. We sat in the patio where they have fans and it's mostly covered.  Ordered the Skinny Cosmo which was surprisingly tasty! They put just the right amount of juice and liquor in it. Our waitress was very attentive, and super sweet. Our silverware and napkins were pretty stained and she wouldn't stop apologizing. She was cute. They brought bread out pretty quickly. We order and shared three appetizers: Shrimp Spring Rolls, Asian Lettuce Wraps, and their tomato basil flatbread thing. All three were pretty good except for the lettuce wraps... They were extremely salty. The rolls came with a peanut sauce and a soy type orangey sauce. For it not being a Vietnamese place, it was not too shabby!  I didn't get dessert this time but I usually go for the Red Velvet Cheesecake. Yummmyy. Waitress brought out our check at perfect timing, not too early and not too late. Yay! :)"
Eddy P.,"Phoenix, AZ",24,8,10,1.0,4/2/2016,"So overrated OMG. I order a pasta dish with shrimp, and my shrimps are cold as they come on shrimp cocktails. Cheesecake factory is nothing else but a wanna be high class restaurant for people with a huge illusion."
Destiny M.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,3,4,5.0,5/21/2015,This place is amazing! Delicious food and great service! I got the Fettuccine Alfredo with Chicken and the Hershey's S'mores cheesecake. I highly recommend both 5 stars all the way!
Tim P.,"Phoenix, AZ",15,94,38,2.0,3/19/2015,"My brother referred to The Cheesecake Factory as an upscaled Denny's/ You know, he is right.  Lots of booths, big menu, predictable outcome. 1 star for large (or is too large) portions 1 star for wide variety of cheese cake options. A bit too busy, noisy and too large for our tastes."
Danielle H.,"Glendale, AZ",0,1,,5.0,1/17/2017,My boyfriend and I went on 1/17 and we genuinely had a great time! Food was good and our bartender Kevin went above and beyond to meet our specific needs. My boyfriend tends to be a little particular in the way he likes to be served and Kevin was happy to accommodate each and every request. We will definitely be back because of Kevin!
Happy J.,"Glendale, AZ",17,192,15,4.0,7/30/2014,"I've been here several times and realized I never wrote a review. Always a great experience! Staff is always friendly, upbeat, and helpful with suggestions (and not always suggesting the most expensive items either). Had to stop the last server from refilling my water glass. It was never less than half full. Big portions, very delicious, and great desserts...or is that an obvious comment? They lose a star 'cause it's a bit on the pricy side even with big servings. If they had Wi-Fi available in the bar area, I could work while enjoying an adult beverage and more."
Brandon S.,"Goodyear, AZ",0,8,,2.0,6/18/2017,"Went here for Father's Day and must say it was very disappointing.  When we walked in there was a 30-40 minute wait for any inside tables and no wait for outside. We checked outside and it was warm but comfortable and didn't plan on spending much time at the restaurant.  Once we were seated on the patio it took about 5 minutes before anyone even came to get our drink order. We placed our drink orders and then waited another 10 min or so.  We got our drinks and some bread (even though we asked for extra) and then ordered very simple dishes. As it was Father's Day there were other families nearby, and I watched as food came out to another table one plate at a time.  They then told the father his would be out in a few minutes, ten minutes later he gets his food and I was like wow that's horrible on Father's Day.  Then we waited and  waited and the same thing happened to us after being there for an hour.  Two of the five orders came out, then two more a few minutes later. Then my dish came out and he described it as a lunch size pasta and I said I didn't realize I had ordered a lunch size because I had not, I also noticed that it did not have the chicken in it that it was supposed to have.  I said it was fine due to waiting an hour and just asked if I could get the chicken. He took the dish back and then came back to say that our server made a mistake and  they are going to make a new one and it would be out in a few minutes. 15 min later it comes out after my family had pretty much finished their meals.  I asked the server why everything was taking so long and he said ya know the Father's Day brunch and whatnot, which didn't make sense because the patio was only 1/4 full.  Anyways the pasta is the one I get every time and the sauce was like soup.  After being on the patio for over an hour and a half it was time to go as the sun had been hitting us and we should have been out of there a lot sooner.  Definitely not the most enjoyable Father's Day experience which is a huge let down as it is one of our favorite places.  Not sure if we will be back."
Lisa Monique C.,"Peoria, AZ",12,142,129,4.0,3/18/2015,"The servers here are very nice. They treat me good everytime I come in! As far as the food goes, it is hit and miss. In the past I have ordered fried fish, pasta and wings and they were disgusting. More recently, I have ordered the appetizer burger sliders, artichoke and spinach dip, and kale and quinoa salad. They were DELICIOUS! They're menu is so large that you sometimes don't know what to order! May the odds ever be in your favor. Cheesecakes are great! My favorite slices are oreo cheesecake and red velvet. YUM!"
