Tyler B.,"Glendale, AZ",222,325,15,3.0,2/26/2016,"This would have had 4 or more stars; however we ran into a problem while visiting. My fiance and I waited so long for our lunch to be served in a half empty restaurant that one of the managers came by to tell us it's taking a bit longer (this was when we already were sitting there for nearly 40 minutes). Food was good as expected, but not a good impression on our first visit here. They did not offer any discount or partial comp. We ordered an appetizer and 2 lunch meals and it took about 90 minutes from beginning to end because the food was so late. Still giving it 3 stars; however could have easliy gotten 4 or more if they were a bit more on top of things."
Dennis B.,"Glendale, AZ",16,58,373,1.0,1/15/2014,"We sat a place in a circular room and the waiter there kept calling us boss which we don't like, and then someone closed the blinds when we wanted them open.  We told  David to close them, but it kept going up and down it was annoying.  We told him we were not happy, and then the manager comes and talks to another table to ask them how they are doing, what about us?  The situation was bad, and when we asked the manager about it, she said that she wanted to get the table sat and really did not care about what other people thought basically.   Well avoid the place, they are more concern with filling tables than customer service."
Debbie H.,"Circle Pines, MN",7,26,,5.0,4/14/2016,Great lunch!  Food was very good (crusted chicken Romano and a mushroom burger) but waitress Chayle was great! We will come back just to have her wait on us again!
Chanel H.,"Phoenix, AZ",3,19,10,2.0,3/30/2016,"Okay so its a pretty place I will definitely say that. The inside was crowded so I decided to sit outside. Our waiter was super friendly and helpful and was the best part of our experience. everything was prompt. That's the best I can say. Now the cons, They didn't have the heaters turned on outside, our glasses were filthy. I ordered the chicken Alfredo. It was really under cooked, and the sauce was pure liquid, and it tasted soupy, the chicken was tough and THERE WAS A HAIR IN MY FOOD. I made them take it back and fix it. Came back perfect. My husband ordered some seafood pasta dish he loved it. I ordered the linda chocolate cake and it was EXTREMELY DRY. our total came out to 77.00 and I am probably not coming back based on how much of a let down the food was."
Saurav C.,"Phoenix, AZ",29,30,14,5.0,8/9/2015,"Ambience was very good.. It was noisy and crowdy.. Had imperial chicken and bang bang chicken.. Liked the food.. However it was little costly.. Definitely go for cheesecake, very yummy"
Cory W.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,2,,3.0,5/19/2016,"I had a wonderful dinner last night with my boyfriend and our waiter was awesome. The portion sizes are ginormous, so I took my leftovers home. I was looking forward to eating my pasta today, and noticed it WAS NOT my food! IT WAS SOMEONE ELSE'S LEFTOVERS! EW. So grossed out and super upset I wasn't able to enjoy the rest of my pasta."
Tanner S.,"Surprise, AZ",37,1,,3.0,10/27/2015,"The service at this location is terrible, even if the food is good. My girlfriend and I have gone on two separate occasions and we were consistently ignored by the servers. They were too focused on the older and elderly groups at the restaurants and didn't help us when we needed it. Our most recent waitress was very disrespectful after we asked for a change in our order. We both felt very uncomfortable continuing to sit there. I've had better service at Olive Garden.  The food is incredible however. If the service wasn't lacking I'd recommend this place just for its food to anyone."
Trent P.,"Phoenix, AZ",36,135,10,3.0,3/3/2016,"When we arrived we thought we were going to have to wait a LONG time for a table because of how busy it was and the fact they don't take reservations on weekends. However, it turned out we got a seat after only 15 minutes... they have quite a few tables. Our server did a great job and was prompt with everything. She even brought us extra bread and a sliced up banana for our two young boys. We ordered food (I had a bbq burger and fries), which arrived quickly. I was looking forward to the Thai Peanut Noodle dish they make, but sadly it is no longer on the menu and they wouldn't make it for me. The burger was good, nothing special though. The cheese cake was really good; it isn't the best but still tasty. I would recommend and return."
Cathy W.,"Saline, MI",0,3,,4.0,11/6/2016,"Ordered Renees trio. $12.50 includes soup, salad & sandwich. All 3 were excellent, and the servings of all 3 were very generous. No cup of soup, it was a bowl. The chicken salad sandwich was wonderful except it was grilled and had i known i would have requested it not grilled. Loved it."
Fahira C.,"Phoenix, AZ",181,102,36,3.0,12/18/2014,"This place was just what i have expected.  The food was ok, for sure not worth the price that we have paid. I ordered a bowl of pasta that cost me $17.50. Just pasta with sun dried tomatoes. Too much.  Service was just ok as well...They were semi-busy so the server was bouncing of the walls like he had 100 tables.  I am not saying it is bad place to go to if you like heavy food that all tastes the same."
Amy L.,"Scottsdale, AZ",652,13,5,5.0,5/16/2016,Can never go wrong with this place!  I dine solo a lot and Helen is always attentive and knows exactly what I'm getting every time.  I love the happy hour menu.  It has my favorite appetizers at an unbeatable price!  Thank you Helen!
Alexandria M.,"Phoenix, AZ",68,39,16,1.0,3/30/2016,Worst Cheesecake Factory experience I have ever had. Avoid this location at all cost. The service from not only the wait staff but the manager was horrible. The food was less than average as well. I had to send my plate back because the cook had it extremely wrong. Then after speaking to the manager we had to request to have the meal taken off of our bill. The meal they messed up and we sent back. That should have been an obvious removal. How can you even think about charging someone for something they did not eat? Low class location stay away.
Lisa S.,"Buckeye, AZ",0,10,,2.0,4/23/2016,I used to love this place and brought all visitors here because they have such a diverse menu. Something for everyone. After a bad experience a few years ago  I talked my mom into going since we were in the neighborhood.  Staff is friendly and sitting outside is always a plus but that is where is the good review ends.  I had a Korean chicken burger that had nice flavor but was literally a giant piece of chicken on a soggy bun with a few shredded carrots on top (cole slaw). It was the sadest looking burger. I mistakenly got a side salad instead of fries which was just soggy lettuce. That's it. The kind of lettuce that was mixed with dressing early in the morning and put in the refrigerator and served throughout the day. It was inedible. My mom unfortunately got a salad as well and I think they must have pulled the same lettuce for her. She didn't even eat half her salad. And the waitress didn't even ask us if something was wrong with it. Thank goodness for the bread! Not sure I will be back but I sure miss the old Cheesecake Factory.
Kay K.,"Glendale, AZ",23,320,6,3.0,2/4/2014,"Casual dining is going away and so is my love for Cheesecake. The food seems to be oversauced and over-condimented. Lettuce in salads never has that crispness and freshness I expect. Jambalaya and Gumbo are great, so are the sandwiches, but there are always waits and service is too scripted. Used to be a fan of the BBQ Chicken Salad, but it's faded out of glory.  Oh and save room for a Cheesecake."
Lana J.,"Peoria, AZ",3,50,7,3.0,2/7/2016,"The service sucks except for couple employees who have been there a long time. If it wasn't for Karnina and few other hard working employees then we wouldn't go there anymore. Careless employee when we order to go, I ask him every time, did you remember to put everything, he says yes, we look and there are always couple of things missing. The manager needs to do something about a better system of making sure nothing is missing in a persons order. We always order $80 or more for our friends and family, usually $100-200. So when things are missing it's disappointing. We love Cheesecake Factory but this location needs to improve in there to go orders."
Gustavo S.,"Tempe, AZ",0,4,4,4.0,12/16/2014,Great place for dinners for a date/families. Friendly employees great food and delicious cheesecake.
Sandra S.,"Surprise, AZ",0,41,,4.0,9/11/2016,"Went for lunch and had no wait for a table. Server was very attentive and gave us more time to peruse the extensive menu. Samosas were very good. Orange chicken actually had an orange taste. Loved that brown rice was available for the teriyaki chicken which unlike some places, was not overly salty and was all white meat. Portions are huge even for the lunch time size. Would prefer less food and lower price. Shared the chocolate hazelnut cheesecake which was outstanding."
Tam F.,"San Ramon, CA",489,1397,253,3.0,3/2/2013,"I met a girlfriend here around 8pm on a Wednesday night. She was in need of a nosh and I was in need of an adult beverage. We knew CF was open later than a lot of places and I have typically had decent luck here. This location is better than some and not as good as others. I think it is probably hit or miss depending on what time of year and what time of day you come. It was during this visit that my friend and I realized we have been legal to drink for 20 years now but have had been ""drinking"" together since we were 15 or so(shshsh-don't tell my folks). I am a cheap drunk-or shall I say a lightweight. My friend ordered Vodka/Cranberry (aka-a Cape Cod) and I decided to join her but to make it a better vodka for both of us. The drinks were weak. Seriously weak. I am typically a 2 sip and buzzed gal and yes, I said something. Our waiter apologized, made sure my friend had extra goodies for her meal and for just a meager $2.00 extra, I added a shot (split between our cocktails) and voila, we were able to make a decent drink.  Don't worry CF-I am sure I will be back though you are located in the same vicinity of nearly every chain restaurant. If only I could get Grandma to come here with me instead of Red Lobster...but CF doesn't do coupons!"
Davene M.,"Yuma, AZ",5,17,10,2.0,2/20/2015,They need to update their page bcuz it Says they take Reservations but when u call they refuse
Shannon E.,"Gilbert, AZ",323,322,205,4.0,1/28/2013,"We stopped here for lunch with the baby on Saturday.   We were seated immediately and the server got us our drinks and some warm bread and butter right away.  Our server was very friendly (in fact just a little too sugary sweet) and she did her job well. We ordered from the lunch menu.  I got the Miso Salmon and my husband ordered the cheese pizza.  Our food was out within 15 minutes and mine was delicious, but my husband said his pizza was just so-so and about the same quality as a cheese pizza from Sam's Club.  (OUCH!) Anyway, our bill for two passion fruit iced teas, a lunch pizza, a lunch salmon and a slice of the pina colada cheesecake (to go) was $42, before gratuity.  The baby just ate off of my plate because she is too little for her own plate still. I ate the pina colada cheesecake slice later that night and it was just okay.  It may just be me, but I think that their more exotic cheesecake flavors aren't nearly as good as the plain old vanilla bean cheesecake.  Maybe it's because the other ingredients in the more exotic cheesecake varieties detract from their perfect vanilla cheesecake recipe...?  I dunno what it is, but I've experienced this phenomenon more than once.  Sadly this time I thought it'd be different with the promising pina colada flavor, but it just didn't deliver.  It didn't taste very tropical, or very cheese-cakey.  I'll just remind myself to order the plain vanilla cheesecake next time and stop being drawn in by the tempting siren song of the exotic cheesecake flavors."
