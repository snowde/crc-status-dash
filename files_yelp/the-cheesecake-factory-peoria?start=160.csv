Shannon C.,"Chino Valley, AZ",31,25,3,5.0,12/30/2015,"Had an amazing dinner date! The place was packed so I was a little worried, but our server was on top of it the whole time! I had the BBQ Ranch Chicken Salad (5 stars), and my boyfriend had garlic noodles with shrimp (5 stars)! And to top it off we shared a piece of Craig's carrot cake cheesecake! It was to die for! All-in-all A++"
Eryke S.,"Glendale, AZ",13,9,16,4.0,2/9/2015,"I had the catfish breaded  to perfection seasoned not so much nice helping of mashed potatoes the green beans were fresh and snappy, sauteed with sweet carmelized onions excellent with a side of corn tartar sauce nothing special I was little disappointed that the catfish didn't come with more seasoned flavor.  Topped it off with a slice of key lime cheesecake they were out of the Mango Key Lime so the classic Key lime was a good substitute and it was as I suspected creamy indulgence a little too much whipped cream."
Christopher N.,"Goodyear, AZ",21,5,,1.0,1/23/2016,Don't come here! My 9 year old daughter begged us to take her here for her birthday. They won't take reservations. We came at 6pm and they didn't seat us until 8pm. Then they crammed 11 of us into the space of 8 outside after them temperature had dropped 15 degrees. They couldn't move the heaters to our table because other customers were complaining of the cold. Over priced and mediocre food to top it all off. My family will never come back.
Mia D.,"Glendale, AZ",15,57,10,5.0,12/23/2015,"On 11/20/15 I had the most amazing service from a very happy waitress. It was my boyfriends and I 1 year anniversary. She was soo positive and attentive. I never had such great service especially for a chain restaurant which is usually why we stay away from them, Thankyou for a great night!"
Briann F.,"Slaughter, LA",38,107,99,5.0,9/4/2013,I love cheese cake factory!  This one has great service always very quick   I love their blueberry mojito
Mark S.,"Peoria, AZ",57,142,34,5.0,7/12/2014,"There is no reason for me not to give this Cheesecake Factory 5 stars. There was nothing wrong with anything you look for in a dinning experience. - Seated quickly - Good and attentive service - Fantastic food for my wife and I - Reasonably priced - Great selection of food, dinks, and desserts I wish I could remember our servers name but he was on point with everything. Gave us extra bread and kept the ice tea coming. The BBQ Chicken Pizza was very good, and the wife shrimp sandwich was fantastic! Lets never forget the classic strawberry cheesecake to top it off, and I already can't wait to go back."
Evelyn L.,"Avondale, AZ",19,104,40,5.0,7/25/2014,"Never been disappointed at this Cheesecake Factory,  the service is always great. I especially like the bread they bring while you wait for your food so fresh and yummy.  I can't really tell you about any other dish other than the Chicken Madeira and the chicken alfredo, what can I say I love chicken.  The tropical tea is also really good tricks you into thinking its sweet so no sugar is reallw needed."
Heidi P.,"Shelton, WA",1,17,26,3.0,8/29/2015,"I went to this Cheesecake Factory last night with my family, there were 6 of us. We all thought the meal was not that good. Tortilla Chips were given with the artichoke dip. That doesn't go with the dip. Bread would have been nicer. The dip wasn't that good anyways. The crab wontons were good as well as the cheesy bread. All except one of us had pasta dishes. All the dishes were bland with very little toppings. The other person got fish tacos. He was happy with that. The cheesecake is always good. We will not go back for anything there again except for the cheesecake. The service is good, but unless the food is good, there is no point in going."
Fletcher B.,"Goodyear, AZ",40,13,10,5.0,2/14/2015,"Although it is busy, I find that the staff is prompt when finding seating.  The food is phenomenal, the restaurant is clean, nice background music, over all I would say this is the best cheese cake factory I have yet to visit!"
Veronica V.,"Phoenix, AZ",56,101,124,4.0,10/12/2014,"Went on a weekday and it was a fun stress free evening with the family. I made reservations the day before for 5pm because the said they couldn't make it for any later. If I wanted a later time I would have to call back the same day. Any how we made it in time and had a pleasant experience. Staff were polite and attentive to our needs. Portions here did seem smaller than what we have become accustomed to for Cheesecake Factory. Went on a Monday evening, lots of elderly folks who wanted to chat, nothing wrong with that. Just we are trying to enjoy ourselves not get questioned about us being the biological parents of our children. I just may have to stick with the Scottsdale location in the future."
Johnny H.,"Phoenix, AZ",1,12,2,4.0,2/7/2016,"First off, this place is AMAZING! My wife and I come here three times a month at minimum. It's the go to place! We split Factory Nachos and a strawberry lemonade. Over the years I can count ONE time that our nachos were unsatisfactory and when we talked to a manager they took excellent care of us! The only reason for the one star is the occasional bad server, But that's very rare. We'll typically leave a twenty percent Tip without hesitation. Defenitly recommend!"
Judy L.,"Avondale, AZ",440,1127,1324,4.0,10/2/2010,"I choose Cheesecake Factory for my birthday lunch. I love that many many MANY choices you have. And if you there before 5pm, you can order a lunch portion (dinner portions are HUGE). The service is always great.  My favies:  Tex Mex eggrolls  Romano crusted chicken  Vanilla bean cheesecake  Red velvet cake cheesecake  Burgers  Pasta dishes...  I have not gotten anything I did not like yet!"
Ivy H.,"Phoenix, AZ",68,43,57,5.0,9/7/2015,Great time today on Labor Day & celebrating a birthday! Seated our party of 10 quickly and efficiently. Had an all star team serving us. No problem making accommodations for our needs. Food was tasty and came hot and always plenty of it! Had to take home so much. Refills were plentiful & it was very pleasant all in all for the experience & pricing. Thanks CCF.
Doug H.,"Glendale, AZ",95,143,33,1.0,4/8/2014,"Could be the waitress I've had the last two times I've been here, but my general feeling is that this place is rarely worth the money. We went for dinner after a Spring Training game and our waitress had difficulty splitting a bill in half (she hand wrote the totals on the original receipts..?). Service was slow but it was late and we had drinks and a group so it wasn't an issue so much. Food was meh. Then I go in for lunch today, same waitress. I think ""oh great, this should be an adventure"" -- boy was I right. Took over an hour for 2 lunch portions and an appetizer for our table. Nothing complex, either (2 fish and chips and a baked artichoke). It seemed that the waitress had no concept of time -- likely because she was standing at the bar just inside talking to her coworkers while we burned up on the patio waiting for food. She also failed to bring out condiments we asked for -- I would have reminded her, but the next time we saw her, she was bringing the checks. I may not have cared so much if I wasn't on a lunch break, but when it's business lunch hour, you'd think the waitstaff would try to acknowledge that. $20 for lunch with slow service and average food is never worth it. Honestly don't think I'll be returning unless it's for cheesecake to go, which seems to be the only considerate service in the place."
Shawn N.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,42,,1.0,1/22/2017,"Incredibly disappointed in our visit here.  Have been to many of their restaurants and they are typically about 4 stars.  Went here for my daughter's birthday in early January.  Had to wait 40 minutes on a Saturday night but were able to get some drinks and hang out at the bar.  Was somewhat surprised how expensive the drinks were but we were celebrating.  After waiting 40 minutes the best they could do was cram our party of 5 into a 4 top in the very back corner of the restaurant.  We made the best of it but why even have tables if the experience is less than the best.  Best thing we could say about this table was it was close to the bathroom.  Service was OK but the food was not good.  Probably should have sent it back but by the time we got it we had been there over an hour and a half.  My wife's hamburger was over charred to the level it was charcoal.  My dinner was tasteless and nobody was overly excited about what they had.  5 different dinners and all were at best average and 2 were poor.  Quantity is typically good but for what we ordered this time even that wasn't above average.  Total bill for 5 people was about $250 including drinks and tip.  For that kind of bill, I expect much more.  I don't expect to go back again.  Too many good restaurants to waste money on overpriced food, that isn't good and where they don't take reservations and a 90 minute meal stretches into 2 1/2 hours."
Marcee F.,"Phoenix, AZ",9,12,1,2.0,4/6/2014,"Really really bad service. Slow, lots of mistakes. I'll do carry out in the future. Didn't bring out bread until asked twice, brought empty bottle of steak sauce, burger ordered medium well came out red with bun soaked in blood."
Aura C.,"Monterey Park, CA",510,463,11,4.0,7/24/2012,"Talk about options!  It's almost unfair to have so many items on a menu.   Especially when the food is so good.  I have gone to the Cheesecake Factory several times and have not been able to even put a dent in the menu. So, I wasn't too hungry this time, so I decided to order from the small plates menu.  We started with the corn fritters.  Then I ordered the shrimp and grits and my husband ordered the hibachi steak.   The only reason I didn't give them five stars is because we didn't get our appetizer until the our food was ready.  And by that time, we had already stuffed our faces with bread and butter (which is delicious)!  The server apologized for delay in bringing our app and the manager came by and didn't charge us for the corn fritters.  That was much appreciated!  We only had one of the fritters since our other dishes were in front of us and we didn't want those to get cold.   I really like the shrimp and grits.  I think the dish came with a little too much sauce...but that's just me....I just really liked the taste of the cheddar grits.  My husbands steak was really really good!  The hibachi steak is what I normally ordered.  I will go back again!"
Emilee M.,"Temecula, CA",11,37,35,4.0,9/21/2014,The Cheesecake Factory is an an amazing restaurant! There are so many choices with different types of food depending on what you are in the mood for! Try the s'mores cheesecake! It's delicious!!
Eddie M.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,5,,5.0,2/6/2016,Always love the CF! Incredible how every time you go you find great staff. They know that huge menu so well! I appreciate that they allow me to substitute and create what I want when I order. Always excellent. It was packed out but we got in and out in an hour and a half.
Jan W.,"Lisle, IL",0,12,,4.0,1/15/2016,"Waited ten minutes to place a to go order on the phone, but Kevin the manager came to the rescue. Food was very good. Thanks to Kevin!"
