Michelle M.,"Peoria, AZ",37,53,74,4.0,3/22/2014,"I always like this place. The food quality is consistent and the service is worth a 20% gratuity. I enjoy loud restaurants that buzz, so Cheesecake delivers every time . Menu is overwhelming at times, so I find myself sticking to my faves, such as chicken potstickers, bathing in a sweet soy sauce and black toasted sesame seeds. Depending on our hunger level, farfella with chicken and roasted garlic is full of flavor and perfect to share....a little more hunger and we dig into the spicy cashew chicken over white rice. I would stay away from the burgers, nothing special there. It's a hit or miss if we order cheesecake, but when we do, it's usually the original cheesecake with strawberries....if the kids are with us, those chocolate lovers order the Godiva or red velvet cheesecake. Either way, they're all delish.  If it's just the two of you and you don't want to wait 30+ minutes to be seated, ask to be seated at the bar or high tops...we usually get seated right away!"
Deborah M.,"Peoria, AZ",9,7,,5.0,10/8/2015,"My favorite place to eat! Service is always awesome and the menu is huge, even the pickiest eaters can find something to satisfy their pickiness the cheesecake is so delicios! Always have to get a piece to go."
Melanie M.,"Buckley, WA",0,5,,3.0,7/7/2016,"It was ok but not great.  If felt like we paid way to much for what we got.  The cheesecake was great!  Our server was a dud,  no personality.  I felt like we inconvenienced him"
Veronica A.,"Glendale, AZ",0,3,,5.0,11/6/2015,"The food and service was exceptional. Our server Amanda was the best! She would get us refills on drinks and bread before we even had to ask. She was super nice and everything got to us quickly. I love the food here there are plenty of choices. I personally enjoyed the Miso Salmon. Also you can't leave without getting a slice of cheesecake while you are here. I would recommend the Craigs Crazy Carrot Cheesecake, it was yummmmm!"
Candice L.,"Surprise, AZ",14,327,6,2.0,4/6/2015,"Don't order takeout here. Better yet, don't order anything but the cheesecake, because the value is just terrible. I understand that takeout food is usually not hot, but my food was literally cold once I got it to my house (5 minutes away). The hosts and hostesses were pleasant, which is why I'm adding a star."
Liz B.,"Corona, CA",26,2,5,1.0,10/8/2015,This was a total disappointment in customer service. We wanted to treat our daughter to a special night for her sweet 16 birthday. Our waiter seemed to be rushed creating a very uncomfortable atmosphere. The thought of begging our server for more bread and water as he rushed passed our table. Makes me wish we would have stayed home in the comfort of our own home for this very special event. When our food finally arrived after what seemed like a hour I could not help take notice the restaurant was nearly empty making me wonder why our service was so uncalled for. Our server brought our food out he again apparently was in a hurry since he handed me a very hot plate I nearly dropped it on the table! When I expressed the plate was hot he did not comment and rushed off! Don't be fooled by the fancy exterior I would much rather stay home.
Leslee S.,"Surprise, AZ",21,88,24,4.0,7/7/2015,I love their Orange Chicken!  We also ordered an order of the Avacado eggs rolls and enjoyed them!  Of course they have a multitude of cheesecake to choose from.  When I'm in a cheesecake mood I go for dark chocolate or the smores.
Audrey E.,"Peoria, AZ",18,85,3,4.0,5/17/2015,You really can't go wrong here! They have such a wide selection yet nothing falls short! I've had the chicken pasta the past two times because it's so good! For not being specifically catered to Italian food it's the best I've had even over Italian restaurants! So much flavor and just great overall quality! I'm not big on expensive classy restaurants but I will definitely be coming back for more!
Iron G.,"Tucson, AZ",0,26,,1.0,1/29/2014,"OK, it took me a while to finally visit this restaurant and I had to get a gift card to go...I have good intuition about places. Come to find out I was right on the money, this place sucks! First off, don't serve Mexican food if you have no idea how it is made. I should have known better than to order the chicken enchiladas but hey, I felt daring. This ridiculous small amount of food was a joke. They have no idea how chipotle or cilantro is used. The rice was doused in so much cilantro it would have gagged Speedy Gonzoles, Their chipotle sauce used on the enchiladas tasted canned and the side of black beans were undercooked, not al dente, undercooked. The plate was about $14, I have no idea how much my Shirley Temple was but it must have been a lot since I only ordered a slice of cheesacake to go and the whole thing, with tip (I left 15%, crappy service) was $32! I suppose to some people that's not a lot, but to someone who actually WORKS for a living this is outrageous especially for the quality of food one recieves. I think it also imporatant to mention my stomach hurt that night when I got home, and I normally have an iron stomach. It only got one star because it doesn't give the option for NO star. Bad show."
Guy B.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,2,,1.0,4/8/2014,"I have been to this location twice now.  The first time I went, the appetizer came out after the meal.  Also, I was at the place for over an hour for lunch, and most of that was just waiting for food.  I decided to give it a second try, again waiting over an hour.  Place is extremely slow, avoid this place, unless you have an hour and half to have a simple lunch."
Tim O.,"Buckeye, AZ",39,62,4,2.0,2/16/2015,"I'm not sure why people come here anymore. Oh sure, back in the day this place was amazing. Now, you can taste the prepackaged microwave-ness. I had the Kobe burger, 12.50 for a tasteless burger. My wife had the the pear and endive salad. There were no pears. The service was slow. The food was not at temperature. Soda machine was broken."
Susan S.,"Litchfield Park, AZ",34,11,1,5.0,12/5/2015,Every time I come in the service is professional and the food is good. If you don't mind waiting sometimes this is a great place to go for any meal. One of the few places I can count on to be consistent.
Yvonne H.,"Denver, CO",59,67,165,3.0,5/30/2015,Ok..so this is a chain but thought I would check in anyway. My other half and I wanted to catch Cinderella on the screen nearby and thought we'd grab a bite here. The wait wasn't bad..I ordered the veggie burger and fries and the Hubs chose a burger also  10 mins. Later was told the veggie burger was sold out..darn! So I went with the garlic pasta because it sounded delicious and the Hubs changed his mind to shrimp. .I love garlic!.. Mind you I was quite famished by the time it came.. I dug in and boy was I quite disappointed to find they are merely butter noodles no garlic or garlic flavor at all..bummer :( The shrimp asked I'm told was oj. Maybe I wanted to be blown away by garlic..but alas was not.  I did eat what I ordered because I was hungry.  Did I let them know?  Yes but since it was busy and it took time to get the waiter back. The manager came by. He took care of it and we were happy. We will be back.
C F.,"Peoria, AZ",2,25,,1.0,4/14/2016,"I've been so busy I have not had time to write this review for The Cheesecake Factory on 83rd Avenue and Bell Road. I was in last week and had a Pit Beef Dip. It was horrible it was the cheapest made worst-tasting sandwich I have ever had. First off not once not twice but three separate times when taking a bite I hit the paper skin from The Onion.  The meat of which there was very little would not have even been comparable to Subway because it's lack of quality. Please note this sandwich was $14 and I could have got a better sandwich at Subway Arby's or any Delicatessen. Normally I would not have been so bothered as much if it would have been for the poor attitude of my waitress. When I pointed it out to her she said ""so you hit the skin of the onion I will let the kitchen know"".  Then she asked if there was anything else she could do for me today or if I was ready for my check. I was flabbergasted no empathy or at least a simple apology!  I thought why even go to the manager  this all ready shows their lack of management skills an obvious inability to properly train their servers and the poor quality of food they provide. From my experience The Cheesecake Factory is a classy facade with a lackluster of Quality help and food."
Emily N.,"Phoenix, AZ",1,16,2,1.0,4/5/2015,"Don't come here with a dairy allergy. They acted accommodating, but I am now home very sick. They had no allergy print out, which is common so whatever, but I worked hard then with a lot of questions about what I could eat since they were unprepared for lactose allergies. Finally, I ordered the salmon salad, and I could tell there was some sort of butter on the salmon. They sent it back to the kitchen and came back saying it's just mustard and that the kitchen is aware of my allergy. I am now very sick so clearly there was an issue here."
Rosemary L.,"Goodyear, AZ",0,120,,1.0,8/10/2015,"Wow, love this place, but today it was awful, carbonara pasta was no cream all grease, hubby's Shepard pie was swimming in oil! Love to come for my birthday here food always so good, not today, taste like weekend leftovers! So disappointed, guess won't be coming back anytime soon!"
Valerie M.,"El Mirage, AZ",0,1,,1.0,5/15/2016,"I became very sick after eating at this location. My friend notified the manager that I was sick and throwing up in the parking lot. The managers response was"" let me know if she goes to the hospital so I can get corporate involved"". My food didnt taste good, it made me sick but the icing on the cake was the mangers response. I would have appreciated at the very least a drink of water. EXTREMELY  DISSATISFIEDD & Dissapointed in the entire experience."
Catie H.,"Glendale, AZ",0,3,3,1.0,9/7/2015,"We chose The Cheesecake Factory to entertain our  out of town guests today,  and were EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED! Complaints: It took over an hour to get our lunch of sandwiches and salads... the salads did not come out first as requested....they served the food one plate at a time over a15 minute period so we were not eating together. ....  and we still did not have the coffee we ordered by the time our food came out.   We went to the restaurant about 2 in the afternoon between the lunch and supper rush. The restaurant was not busy,  and many tables were available.  We were told we'd be seated in about 5 minutes.  At 2:20 they finally gave us a table. We ordered quickly as there was a plane to catch.  Our meals were simple.  Beef a jus sandwich,  chicken Caesar salad,  grilled chicken dinner with salad, and a club sandwich with a salad.  At 2:55 I asked to speak with a manager as our salads were not out yet and we still had not received our coffee.. At at 3:10 they brought the chicken dinner and salad out together.  At 3:15 they brought out the Ceasar salad and club sandwich.  Several minutes later they brought out the beef sandwich and the salad that went with the club sandwich.  Needless to say we did not have time to eat all of our food or drink the coffee. The manager came over and asked if we wanted a cheesecake.  I said,  are you kidding me?  No,  we don't even have time to eat or meal.  We have to leave.  He said, ""I'm sorry if you feel we did something wrong.  If you want to order cheesecake,  it can be packaged to go. "" My sister and I were speechless that he would try to sell us more.   If you want a good meal with good service in a timely manner,  do not go to this restaurant.  It was $28.68 for 2 glasses of wine and a virgin daiquiri while we waited to be seated,  and $66 for sandwiches and salads for 4 people with 2 cups of coffee. The manager never offered any discount on this $95.00 lunch,  not even on the coffee that we didn't get to drink,  and his apology was as lacking as the poor service.  He didn't apologize for bad service or a failure to get our salads out before our meal.  He said he was sorry that WE FELT they did something wrong.  I will NEVER recommend this restaurant to anyone, or eat at another cheesecake factory.  They lost 4 customers today as will as any guests we might have brought them."
David L.,"Cartagena, Spain",6,36,19,1.0,11/23/2013,"It has been a while since I have been here to eat. I must say that it was very disappointing. Their soda machine broke, service was slow and for the first time the food was nothing special.  You won't see me eating there any time soon."
J. J.,"Phoenix, AZ",9,114,168,5.0,3/15/2015,Came for desert. Not a long wait which was great since there was to events going on in the area. Server was friendly and fast. Cheese cake was amazing! Always a plus. The table and surrounding area was clean.
