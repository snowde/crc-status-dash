Larry M.,"Kalispell, MT",1,29,,3.0,1/29/2015,"We have enjoyed infrequent visits to Cheesecake Factory over the years.  The restaurants are always clean and pleasant and this visit was no exception. The staff was friendly and our server was very accommodating as four of us tried to make lunch selections from their huge menu. While I found my Chinese Chicken Salad to have far too much dressing and far too little chicken the greens appeared to be very fresh and the won ton strips crisp.  The other three persons were happy with their choices ranging from Fish Tacos, Meatloaf and a Chicken a salad sandwich and salad.  We shared a cheesecake and it was delicious.  I counted 37 different cheesecakes on the menu! Prices are moderately high but acceptable.  If you know you're going here it would benefit you to look at the menu online to save time and indecision once you arrive."
Bella B.,"Peoria, AZ",0,16,,2.0,6/24/2014,"We went there for our anniversary. I want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service. However, the food was not at what we expected at all! We ordered the shrimp rolls which looked like there was shrimp in the roll but they cut it into what it looked like thirds or halves to make it look like there was more shrimp than there actually was. Also the rice paper kinda grossed us out. We had never had it before, it was very rubbery. Our entrees came out and my pasta was very bland and the orange chicken was something we could have made at home. Our drinks and cheesecake were the best part of our whole dinner. We were disappointed because we were hoping for a nice dinner for our anniversary."
Anthony A.,"Glendale, AZ",2,7,1,4.0,6/29/2014,The food is outstanding. I went here on a date and had awesome customer service. Very warm and welcoming. Place was very clean. And all the employees were dressed and groomed very well. Only gave it 4 stars because I asked for no mushrooms... pasta had mushrooms. Mushrooms are icky.
Tim M.,"Phoenix, AZ",34,378,5,4.0,4/29/2013,"Went there the other night and have the steak Diane, an Asian pear martini and some kind of sweet corn cake appetizer. There food and service is usually very good and their menu covers pretty much any taste. There's no need to mention the cheese cake, it's excellent."
Priscilla E.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,26,,3.0,12/25/2014,The food is average for the price. I would probably only go for the cheesecake next time. It is a bit pricey for what you get. The wings are not great. It was very busy so the service was slow but understandably with the crowd. It does have nice patio seating there.
James G.,"Glendale, AZ",0,12,3,3.0,1/26/2016,For some reason I've been to this location several times and there's days I get the same dish and it's brought out to meet different I don't know if it's been cooked something differently or something change feel good in my opinion just not consistent
Christopher B.,"Miami Beach, FL",294,571,606,5.0,9/23/2012,"Sure it's a chain, but every individual establishment has its quirks. However, this Cheesecake Factory delivers with gastronomic fireworks.  The quality of service and food were reflective of a five-star restaurant without mirroring the small portions and high prices. For instance, the pizza with salad lunch special combo was so big, even a Wooly Mammoth probably couldn't get it all down.  The burgers are also so big, I even had trouble getting my big mouth around it.  The food was exceptionally delicious.  I also highly recommend the Thai Chicken Pasta, which I usually get almost every time. Of course the ambiance inside is also very nice.  I think about 5 staff members said ""thanks for coming"" on the way out.  Hands down, this is one of my favorite chain-locations to dine at!"
Alexa B.,"Surprise, AZ",0,6,,2.0,1/19/2016,"Horrible service! Are original waiter had to go because he had his lunch break. So another waiter came along, then a few minutes later that waiter leaves and a new one comes. We wanted to order desert but we never saw are waiter. So then we finally ordered are desert, (cheese cake) we finished and we asked for the check. The waiter TOOK FOREVER to take the check back and give us our change. But at the end the food was delicious and sometimes your don't get the right servers :/"
Carlos A.,"Peoria, AZ",139,496,108,3.0,3/8/2013,"You know, it's a Cheesecake Factory.  They're all the same as far as food, service, and layout.  Normally I give the chain a 4 based on food quality and good service, but this location is far more challenging to get into than others during busy times.  I gave it a three based on that.  Not their fault I guess, but we've wasted a lot of time waiting around for a table or even for to-go cheesecake.  We probably won't plan on going to this location again unless it's during the off hours."
M B.,"Glendale, AZ",4,12,1,3.0,10/14/2013,"Went over there last night with a party of 22.  Sat out on the patio.  it couldn't have been a nicer evening for a company dinner.   Overall I would say the food was good.  The problem I have with this restaurant is actually their menu.  really, Mexican food, Italian food, American comfort food, Steaks, Fish, etc, etc etc.  It goes on and on.  Pick a style and go with it. As I said it seems as though most everyone was pleased with their order but it was really confusing making a decision.   Portion size unfortunately is solidly American style - WAY TO BIG!  I's no wonder we have a weight problem in the USA. Our server did an excellent job of taking care of us, although the kitchen runners tried to serve us the party next ours food twice. Overall I would go back but not the top of my list. Oh and yes the Cheese Cakes all were excellent!"
Helen G.,"Sun City, AZ",1,33,,1.0,6/15/2014,"Years ago when I lived in Marina del Rey CA a Cheesecake Factory was near by and we went fairly often......it was excellent.  Went to the Peoria, AZ branch and had a terrible experience.  Opted to sit on the patio but they couldn't decide where to sit us and kept changing our table.  Finally sat us a table that was perfect and not under the sun....but a person came along and said it was being held for a party of 9, we were only 5.  They changed us again and that 9 group  showed with a party of 6.   The cutlery had to be sent back 3 times it was so dirty  The server was not too pleasant about this problem.  One of our party went to complain to the manager and so they gave us our desserts N/C........fine, but it didn't improve the service or other problems we had. We will never go back!  Too bad I couldn't give it ""O"" star."
Ben H.,"Glendale, AZ",0,12,1,1.0,7/12/2016,"Jerk server!  Took forever to take even our drink order Saturday during lunch!  My wife wanted to go because she loved a burrito they had several years ago and ordered the only burrito we could find. It wasn't the same - this one called Grande burrito.  She liked it anyway but not like the old one.  She mentioned it to the server and he said ""been working here a year and a half that's the only one"". Okay great, our bad, they stopped making it.  She still liked this one okay.  He came by again later and asked if she didn't like it and she explained it was good but not what she expected and could she have a box because it was huge.  She was smiling while complimenting their portion size!  His reply- no joke - ""grande means big in Spanish"" and I wish I could have videoed him - total ass!  I got a club sandwich, hard to screw that up - long story short, we'll make our own cheesecake and eat elsewhere if this is what The Cheesecake Factory has fallen to!"
Jeff L.,"Peoria, AZ",7,13,,2.0,5/23/2014,"Kobe Burger sucked, was over cooked water past well done. Dry and no flavor, ask for mayo to choke it down. 2 stars because my server was so nice. I would have paid for the meal but she took it off the bill. Cheesecake Factory is a high priced Applebees."
Kristen R.,"Buckeye, AZ",78,6,,1.0,10/5/2015,"Cheesecake Factory USED to be my favorite restaurant. Until yesterday. I went to the Peoria, AZ location with my husband and two kids in the early afternoon. The restaurant was not very busy but our waiter was horrible. We have a one year old and asked for a high chair. He didn't bring it so I had to ask the manager for one. He seemed annoyed at me for asking. Finally like 5 minutes later a hostess brought me the high chair. The waiter came to our table and offered us waters and bread. He also offered the baby bananas (she never received the bananas). He never formally took a drink order. Like 15 minutes later he took our food order. My son wanted a chocolate milk to drink. He didn't get the chocolate milk until after we were done eating. My food came out cold but the plate was scorching (microwaved obviously). I told the waiter and he made my order ""fresh"". After all this I wasn't very hungry so I just got my food to go. My husband and son both received cold food as well. I would expect this from somewhere cheap but I mean come on. We spent over $60 on our lunch. At least it could have been hot. NEVER going back there."
Kim G.,"Peoria, AZ",0,10,6,1.0,11/6/2015,"I'm so disappoint not only in the quality of the food but the service.  My daughter chose this restaurant for her birthday dinner and it was terrible from getting or drinks to the meal.  Two of my kids fell asleep at the table because we were waiting so long.  The manager came over and said desserts on him.  So before we left we got three cheesecakes to go and we went to go pay our bill and they included the cheesecakes on the bill.  Went to the front and talked with a different manager and explained the cheesecake was on the bill, he said this is the first I've heard of this but he would take it off.  What a horrible place that my daughter had to celebrate her 13 birthday!  Cheesecake Factory is definitely off our list!!!!!"
Luciana L.,"Buckeye, AZ",77,771,40,4.0,12/26/2012,"Can't complain ... great service, great cheesecake, decent food."
Floyd C.,"Monterey Park, CA",1572,435,368,4.0,7/25/2012,"I love the Hibachi steak on the menu.  I usually have a good meal here and it is a very nice restaurant.  I wish the menu was smaller so I would not have to read through the 10 to 20 pages of selection.  Overall, great location, plenty of menu options that can be rated good, and nice atmosphere."
Rosquete B.,"Belmont, CA",17,950,366,4.0,1/10/2013,"3 1/2* The Cheesecake Factory Peoria, AZ Great happy hour menu Loved the Skinlicious menu that had a chicken salad & burger Desserts are fab Friendly food service by Michael"
Nick R.,"Phoenix, AZ",62,156,24,5.0,3/21/2012,"It is tough to find a restaurant with a 20 page menu.  Even tougher to find one that does it ALL exceptionally well.   I've been here dozens of times and never, EVER, had a meal that wasn't great. I haven't been much in the last few years because I really try to stay away from chains but went back again for the first time in at least two years last week.  Friggin awesome as usual.  In the past, the only part of their food that I wasn't in love with was their shoestring fries, and they no no longer offer them.  YES!  My meal came with normal perfectly cooked and seasoned fries. The Navajo chicken sandwich is SO GOOD.  Pastas - SO GOOD.  Also, this might sound lame, but their chicken fingers are outstanding. If you or your date are ever not sure what type of food you want, go here. The selection and quality are unbelievable.  So is the service.  5 stars all the way around."
Rob R.,"New River, AZ",2,51,,3.0,11/18/2013,"Food....idk what it is about this place but I don't particularly care for their food. Every time we leave I feel as though we have overspent on just ok food. The cheesecake is always good but how much can you eat before you feel sick. Ambiance....very nice and very clean. Staff...extremely well trained, efficient, helpful. Verdict...for the money I think there are many better choices."
