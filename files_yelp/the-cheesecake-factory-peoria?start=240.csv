Shaina T.,"Peoria, AZ",355,68,23,4.0,2/15/2012,I love this place. I like the dim lights while I eat it's very relaxing. The bread is great! I like the variety. My favorite meal I like to get there is the Thai chicken pasta! Oh my gosh to die for. And any of their cheesecakes are worth getting! :)
Adam C.,"Peoria, AZ",0,2,,1.0,10/27/2015,Absolutely crap service! Took my son and my little sister here for their birthdays with our families. Couldn't get a refill in under 15 minutes. Had to ask them 3 times to do the birthday thing for my son and sister. Then they even mess that up haven't eaten here in years and I remember why. Seriously F--- the Cheesecake Factory.
Nick R.,"Peoria, AZ",16,77,35,5.0,3/9/2014,"The best service/wait staff in conjunction with an excellent menu selection, truly better than all competitors on Bell Rd."
Marty F.,"Scottsdale, AZ",265,314,13,4.0,9/5/2012,"The food always seems to get better with each trip.  Of course when I leave Im stuffed and feel like Im going to explode.  That's my own fault.. I like this location.  We are always seated pretty quickly.  If we have to wait it's maybe 10min average.  Not too bad at all. Service has always been great here.  If you ask for extra's they bring it and never say anything.  When it comes to the food, Cheesecake has pretty much anything you could imagine.  Breakfast burrito? they have it.. Chinese food? they have it..  You name it, they have it. I found that sometimes, you can order an appetizer and it's the size of a regular meal.  I love their buffalo blast chicken appetizers.  it's a ton of food and it will fill you up with no problems. the one thing Ive never had luck with is their club sandwich.  Always been dry for me.   And now we talk about the cheesecake itself.  The pieces are huge and super rich. I recommend splitting it with someone.  They are great though."
Mary R.,"Glendale, AZ",0,8,1,3.0,2/18/2014,"Ordered the steak diane,  came in four little steak pieces,  which I thought was weird, I've never seen a steak come out in anything other than one whole piece. I ordered it medium well, and the first, thickest piece I cut into was borderline medium rare. The other, thinner pieces were also medium. I told my waitress and she took my whole plate - mashed potatoes and shrimp scampi,  back to the kitchen. Meanwhile, my boyfriend finished his pasta meal. The steak finally came back and there were only 3 pieces of steak this time!  The thickest one was missing.  I complained to the manager, Stacy, who was very understanding and offered to get me another piece of steak. I declined because it really didn't matter at that point... She did give us a free dessert and the flavor of the sauce over the steak was good. Otherwise, I've always had good service and food here!"
Kyle H.,"El Mirage, AZ",0,61,,4.0,9/2/2012,"First, I can almost guarantee that you will not find better service in the Valley that tops The Cheesecake Factory. Every visit, every time; this place has it together.  The only reason it gets four (4) stars is due to the price. Taking my family out here and I am sure to get a bill topping one hundred bucks ($100) easily.  However, aside from price, the staff is great and I have never had an issue with any of the waiters/waitresses that work there. The food, albeit a wide variety of it, it always good (with the exception of a steak that I felt was a little dry). If we are looking for a great place to eat and have a little extra cash to spend, this place gets our first looks."
Matthew H.,"Phoenix, AZ",31,21,,5.0,8/14/2013,"Being on a diet, I decided to try their skinnylicious menu.  All items on that menu are under 590 calories.  I tried the Lemon-Garlic Shrimp, served with angel hair pasta and asparagus.  It was wonderful.  There were 6 large shrimp cooked to perfection, the pasta and lemon garlic sauce was very good, not overpowering at all.  I was skeptical at first because when many restaurants try to create a diet friendly menu they almost always forget to keep the food with taste.  Not the case here, this was well done.  This was definitely helpful to my diet at mealtime, especially since I blew it having the pineapple upside down cheesecake for dessert.  Come one, who can go to the cheesecake factory and not have a piece of cheesecake."
Steph M.,"Glendale, AZ",8,10,,2.0,5/16/2013,"Very disappointed in our dinner tonight. Sure it was Mother's Day and crazy busy, but I do expect a clean table (there was dried, sticky food all over our table when we were seated). GROSS! The young man who came to clean it wasn't very happy to do so, so I took the washcloth from him and did it myself. My husband ordered the bang bang chicken & shrimp and said it had about 5 pieces of chicken & shrimp and he was not impressed with the flavor. I had the orange chicken which was served cold & sauce-less. Our bill was well over $100 and I'm sorry but I just expect better. On a more positive note, the kids meals were big and the Oreo cheesecake was rich & delicious (not as impressed with the banana cream though). Unsure at this point if we will return for more than desert."
Scott T.,"Carlsbad, CA",100,642,2530,3.0,3/27/2011,"stopped in for a snack before the PADRES-CUBS game across the street at the PEORIA SPORTS COMPLEX. the restaurant is huge with an over-the-top DISNEYLAND in LAS VEGAS look. the kid's PEPPERONI PIZZA was light, crispy and surprisingly good.  mom and dad shared the VIETNAMESE TACOS which were basically open-faced bao (steamed CHINESE buns) topped with a banh mi filling (roasted pork, cilantro, juliened cucumbers, carrots and onions in a light pickle). the seasoning was minimal (read ""bland"") and the ""sandwich"" itself a bit dry. really like the idea but the execution was weak."
Heather M.,"Wilmington, MA",0,1,,1.0,9/19/2014,"I was there with my family and a group of my mom's friends on Aug. 15, 2014.   We had a larger group (about 16, though our reservation was for 20).  We were there just after the lunchtime rush.  My sister, mom and another family member (with a sleeping 18-month old child) were about 20 minutes early.  I asked to be seated.  I live in Massachusetts and the heat was quite a change, I desperately wanted an iced tea or something to drink.  The Hostess told us that though most of the area for our group was ready, she couldn't seat us as it might upset other patrons having lunch.  She was afraid that if others from our group came, it might be too noisy.  This is a group of military retirees, not a group of high school kids.  After asking a second time, this time to the manager, we were seated about 10 minutes before our group and the reservation time. When it came time to order, we were broken up into groups on how we'd be paying.  I ordered the same thing I've gotten for years, Thai Chicken Lettuce Wraps (from the appetizer menu).  My mom and sister both ordered the same.  The waiter told us about a lunch special but I told him, ""No, I prefer to make the wraps myself"" (as did my sister and mom).  About 20 minutes later, food was delivered, only it wasn't what we ordered.  They sent the pre-made lunch menu wraps.  The waiter told us that it was what we ordered.  Ummm, ""No, I distinctly told you the other wraps.  It's what we wanted and what we have always ordered in the past.""  My sister wasn't willing to wait longer, she took what the waiter brought for her.  My mom and I sent the dishes back.  The waiter said our food would be out shortly.  So, 15 minutes later, out came the manager, apologizing and telling us food would be out soon.  He left the other two orders of wraps and said we could share them with the group, he said he didn't want to throw them out.  Okay, 30 more minutes and still no food.  Finally, as everyone was ready to order their desserts, I called over our waiter and cancelled our lunches.  I ordered a strawberry shortcake--which did come out.   I was thoroughly disappointed.  The discord was evident between the waiter and the manager (who we were told was brand new to the location).  The manager was polite, but the waiter gave us a disgruntled earful.   It was sad, my sister and I were only in town a very short time, this was supposed to be a fun outing, seeing old friends and having what should have been an enjoyable lunch.   Were this my only experience with The Cheesecake Factory, I would likely never return.  I do know that they are usually much better."
Kelly R.,"Phoenix, AZ",469,243,849,3.0,10/14/2011,"Again, food is amazing, service is top knotch, drinks are great, something for everyone, great for celebrating occasions or just treating yourself. However, THERE IS NO PARKING. I MEAN NONE!!!! We drove around for 15 minutes, maybe more. If we weren't meeting people, we would have left."
Zachary W.,"Peoria, AZ",42,26,4,4.0,3/11/2014,"Tourist trap! Expensive but consistently good at providing a relaxing atmosphere and food to die for. Don't forget to grab your cheesecake on the way out. Not a slice, grab a hole cake."
Rashon P.,"Surprise, AZ",16,20,1,5.0,12/2/2013,"Love this place! Always great food, always great service! My personal favorite, when I want to be fat, is the mac n cheese burger with sweet potato fries."
Elizabeth P.,"San Diego, CA",15,269,15,3.0,5/16/2013,"I was pretty shocked to learn that my pasta dish contained over 2000 calories.  Other than that, the pasta was nothing to rejoice about.  Couldn't end a night at the Cheesecake Factory without a slice of cheesecake!"
Vicky K.,"Chicago, IL",1,42,4,4.0,8/12/2013,Took parents here for Mother's Day. Fantastic food and service.
Cassie N.,"Huntington Beach, CA",77,62,55,5.0,11/25/2012,Too busy to make dessert for that special at home dinner - stop by Cheesecake Factory and pick up some dessert to go and you will be a dessert hero!  Don't forget to try the Pumpkin Pecan while it is available!
Ulises R.,"Tolleson, AZ",24,21,2,4.0,6/22/2013,"What can I say i like this place, it isn't special. But I do love the Steak Dianne and Chicken Madiera..."
Caroline D.,"Surprise, AZ",20,78,38,3.0,5/1/2013,"do not sit by the windows, you will be batting away flies the whole time!! We had to ask if we could move because it was so gross and annoying. Had the BBQ burger, it was ok. the sweet potato fries were fresh and crispy. Of course everyone comes for the cheesecake which is always amazing!"
Rebecca S.,"Oceanside, CA",155,53,7,4.0,10/1/2010,"I know, I know...shame on me for eating at a chain restaurant...BUT, I like the options that they have on the menu and I generally like the quality of the food and flavor, plus the portions are large. It was fairly busy when we arrived.  We had to wait maybe 8 minutes for a table, so in the mean time we went to the bar and ordered a drink.  Gin and tonic with lime for me, fat tire for the fiance.  Nothing fancy, nothing to get hyped up about. We were seated in an odd little corner in the back of the restaurant.  It was cozy with the exception of the loud and annoying kid sitting next to me, who clearly had a mild (or extreme) form of ADD.  The parents were doing nothing to prevent the kid from going crazy...but, this forum is not for talk on parenting, so all things aside, let's talk about the food. Our waiter was AWESOME!  His name was Mathew, early 20's (if that), skinny and frail, but overall a bright burst of energy and enthusiasm about his job and serving us.  WAY TO GO.  He had a cute goofy laugh and made the special sound tasty, though it was not what I came to eat. He was prompt to deliver us our water, bread, and come back to take our order.  My fiance ordered the farmhouse burger (burger, pork belly, egg, all the fixins) and I had the farfalle garlic chicken pasta (which came with peas, cream sauce, garlic, tomato, shrooms, etc.).   When the food finally did arrive, I was greeted with something that clearly was NOT my order.  It was a pasta dish, except it had shrimp and spaghetti, instead of bowtie pasta and chicken.  I kindly told the girl this wasn't what I ordered and she graciously brought me back the correct item.  Apparently, she got them mixed up. I ate only two bites before I realized that almost half of the ingredients were missing from my dish.  Mathew came back, I advised him of the issue, and he HAPPILY took the plate back.  I was expecting to see the same food I just snacked on with a splash of peas added.  WRONG.  He brought me back a whole BRAND NEW dish!  Fresher tasting than the last!  Exciting!  He made sure to hook me up on the extra parm cheese too! In either case, I gave this experience 4 stars.  I know that there were some issues that took place, but the way that it was handled and amended really stood out in my mind as excellent.  I genuinely have great experiences when I come here."
Stacey H.,"Irvine, CA",81,210,13,4.0,5/8/2011,"Service is always great, I've been visiting this location for years.  Food is always great as well, I love the chicken avocado club, yesterday I tried the fish and chips and it was delicious.  I also love the drink menu, the pomegranate mojito is top notch. My only complaint is when this place gets busy it seems to fall apart a bit up front.  Hostesses become distracted and spend more time talking to each other and trying to figure things out then getting people seated."
