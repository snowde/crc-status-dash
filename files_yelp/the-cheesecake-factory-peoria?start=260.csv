Debra A.,"Goodyear, AZ",282,31,,4.0,6/26/2013,I love this place its got Morrocan Atmosphere and the food and service is very good! I love the variety of choices with a huge menu! They also have a Skinnylicious Menu if your trying to watch your calories. I had the Luau Salad and it was  Yummy with lots of ingrediants and very fresh tasting! They make excellent cocktails as well ! The passion ice tea is also very good!! They have amazing cheesecake choices as well.
Kenneth V.,"Phoenix, AZ",14,37,10,5.0,8/19/2012,"Today I went to this Cheesecake Factory for brunch. An event was being coordinated by the Wounded Warrior Project organization and I was to meet with other wounded warriors for a little what I thought was a meet and greet. Once I met the coordinator, she mentioned there were to be 70 attendees. Yes. Seven, zero. I braced myself for the worst. At the strike of ten the doors opened and the games began. But what happened threw me off in a good way. The manager asked for the party of 70 right off the bat and immediately had us seated in a very large area of the restaurant designated just for our event. Servers were swarming, the manager was always present, water pitchers were pouring.  Good things were happening and I was truly impressed. I don't know if they had a pep talk in the back before we came in the door and said something like,""There is a group of 70 combat injured guests and their families coming in today. Get them whatever they want and do whatever they ask"" because that is exactly what I felt like was happening. First class service. Now the food. I grabbed the Monte Cristo brunch sandwich which was egg, ham, bacon, and Swiss cheese between two thick pieces of French toast and dusted with powdered sugar. It was just as salty and sweet as you can imagine it was. It was in fact to sweet for me. Thankfully, my wife was having the Baja Chicken Hash meal which was ""Two Crisp Tortillas Topped with Chicken Chorizo, Poblano Chiles, Potatoes, Corn, Peppers, Onions and Cheese. Topped with Eggs and Hollandaise Sauce.""  I copied that from the website so hopefully they don't care but I can't explain all of what was in the meal. It was simply awesome. It was spicy and hearty with the hash browns and I loved it. So my wife and I switched dishes and were officially set. My daughter had a three pancake and bacon meal which she loved. Simple palate simply pleased. One thing to note. The orange juice was truly fresh squeezed and along with the pulp even had that slight bitter rind taste to go with it. The virtual cherry on top of the breakfast. Really, truly, good. It all really came together. 70 of us sat down and there was not a single beat missed by the staff this morning. My coffee and water never went empty. My food came promptly piping hot and tasty. There was a smile on everybody's face and I met some other great Americans and their families. I have been to this Cheesecake Factory in the past and had good service but maybe a little unremarkable. Today was an opportunity for this location to shine and indeed it did."
Jeff L.,"Phoenix, AZ",18,281,,4.0,1/20/2013,Not disappointed by this location.  The typical high quality service and food I would expect. HATE the chairs!!  You lean back and you slide off.
Kathy S.,"Goodyear, AZ",63,22,2,4.0,7/11/2014,"Even when they were crowded, they seated us quickly.  Our server was efficient and our food was typical Cheesecake Factory fare. We will be ordering dessert and plan to return the end of the month for Cheesecake Day."
Dwight T.,"Phoenix, AZ",13,46,58,4.0,4/21/2012,"Really enjoyed the Factory Meatloaf. I usually do not care for gravy, but the roux on this meatloaf made a good sauce forthr meat.  The side of corn with red and green peppers with zucchini cut into it was a nice flavor mash up."
Gabriel S.,"Peoria, AZ",6,12,,5.0,4/21/2013,"Minimal wait time. Waitress was on top of her game. Keep checking on our drinks, kept bringing bread, and was friendly. Ordered fettuccini Alfredo and it was cooked perfectly. Not too hot so I was able to eat as soon as I got my plate. A bit pricey ($15) but good service"
Brenda B.,"Phoenix, AZ",79,509,293,4.0,10/26/2012,"I love their cheese cake , ..to death. Most of what I have tried from the menu is very good as well, even tho it is a chain, certainly give it a try."
Troy N.,"Peoria, AZ",116,95,78,4.0,8/19/2012,"Big portions, Great food, excellent Cheesecake and beautiful decor. If you haven't been here should  definitely put it on the try list"
Adam K.,"Sedona, AZ",3,22,4,5.0,12/15/2012,I sat at the bar the bartender offered good service
Valerie M.,"Phoenix, AZ",442,229,2,3.0,12/23/2011,"I can see why people like this restaurant. It's beautiful inside, the menu is diverse, and who doesn't love cheesecake? I feel like cheesecake is the only thing they do right at the Cheesecake Factory. I appreciate that there are many options on the menu but the food is too rich for me. Everything is either fried or drenched in butter. I wouldn't refuse to eat here but its not my first choice when going out to eat."
Eli H.,"Peoria, AZ",372,585,206,5.0,1/26/2012,"I'm a fan and always will be, the food is always good here and the selection is unbelievable.  I know it is a franchise but a kick ass one if I may say.  I love all the martinis....and I do mean all.  I love the strawberry lemonade, I love the cheesecake (of course), I love the service, the atmosphere is definitely high end but you can still go casual.  I have had several meals hear and could not possibly remember them all but I have never not liked my dish....except that I can never finish because their portions are HUGE."
Ameerah A.,"San Francisco, CA",235,142,44,4.0,6/18/2009,"I was grudgingly here for lunch today, because I was invited by my mom and others and had no choice in the matter really. Although prices have gone through the roof, yes even for lunch, I believe this establishment is still above standards, even for a chain restaurant.  Our waitress was on top of her 'waiting-game', I was not disappointed with her or her service, kudos! Nor was I with the food. I had a Factory Salad, minus the chicken, bacon and the vinaigrette with bacon in it. It was refreshing and I loved the chunks of avocado hidden in the depths of my mountainous salad.  I believe this was the first time I sat on the patio at this location, which was not bad, considering the heat of midday. It was very shady and cool. I don't doubt that inside the restaurant was much cooler. Overall experience, pretty decent, I'm not complaining, I'm full and content. And yes, I left without cheesecake in or on me, so it was a good day, dairy is hating me more and more with age..."
Tina K.,"Peoria, AZ",4,17,2,4.0,8/23/2011,"First time into Cheesecake Factory. We were seated right away and our server Todd, was so very attentive!  We started out our order right with a Skinny Mojito and a Dirty martini and fried Calamari, maybe only 5 minutes after ordering i got out appetizer, the calamari was really good, the breading was light and delicious! I ordered the Chicken and Biscuits that had large chunks of cooked carrots, peas chicken laid on a tower of amazing mashed potatoes and smothered in Gravy! oh.. there were biscuits too. My husband got the Thai Chicken Noodles it looked really good. he said it would have tasted better if it was with shrimp but he still enjoyed it. The food was plentiful for the price. we will definitely be returning!"
Ray A.,"Gresham, OR",0,7,,2.0,11/10/2014,"been there a couple of times , desserts good , but the foods really not , ordered steak diane and scampi last night , got 4 little less than bite size pieces of steak , normally steak diane is a small piece of steak , maybe they were just helping by cutting my meat for be , but when you cook little bite size pieces how can it be cooked medium rare , the shrimp scampi was 3 breaded fried shrimp with a sause , you know desserts good , ray"
Albert H.,"Scottsdale, AZ",117,1222,281,4.0,5/6/2009,"Busy location during prime time hours, but you're stupid if you come here (or anywhere on 83rd ave.) on Friday or Saturday night and expect it to not be busy. Weekday lunch is great here with the extensive menu, especially appetizers, and of course the dessert. What I like the most is the good service because they seem to have a good corporate model for training their employees.  I want to see the perma-smile even if the server is having a sucky day, and you can't over-service me or ask if I want another beer too many times.  I drink a lot, I tip well, so I'm not the person that you want to have an empty glass with on the table.  This place gets it."
Honest J.,"Phoenix, AZ",85,107,6,3.0,7/6/2011,"This place is hit or miss for me.  I've been there several times and it depends on the server who will make it or break it for me.  My other 3 visits were good but the last one wasn't so good.  The food is always pretty good.  The last server I had served me flat diet coke or pepsi and when I complained about it he said ""yea we always get complaints about it"".  I finished my meal and about 15 minutes later he came in with another diet soda from another station and asked me to try it.  I did and it was good except for the fact that I was done with my meal and would've enjoyed it better during.  Desert is always spot on!"
Rich C.,"Peoria, AZ",22,2,,5.0,8/30/2012,"Went here for dinner last night, I had the Shepherds pie and my wife had the Cuban sandwich, both were very good and filling. The place was busy even at 8:30 pm when we arrived. The food was very good and the staff was very friendly, the only thing I could find that I didn't like was the poor lighting."
Ken M.,"Glendale, AZ",2,4,,1.0,4/3/2011,"Went with friends for my wife's birthday dinner. The evening started off okay. Went to the front area to check-in and get our buzzer. Our friends hadn't arrived yet, so waiting wasn't going to be much of an issue. Told the girl that we would be having 6 total guests, but 2 were a surprise for my wife, so please make sure the staff doesn't say anything and to only have 4 place settings at the table. I also told her it was my wife's birthday and to do whatever they do special for birthdays. (Cheesy singing by the waitstaff included.) We went to the bar to have a drink while we waited. WAY overpriced drinks here. $16 for a Merlot and a pina colada. Strike 1. Our pager goes off so I go up to have the staff seat us. I remind the girl up front that the head count is a surprise for my wife's birthday. The hostes takes us to our booth and says ""party of six?"" to which I replied to her ""no it's 4"". So, she went ahead and removed 2 of the 6 place settings. Strike 2. Our friends arrived shortly after we were seated. They were brought over to sit with us and we ordered our drinks and appetizers.  Fried calamari and roasted artichokes were good. Everyone else also enjoyed the avocado rolls. So far, the food is showing some promise over the dumb staff. I ordered the chicken and sausage gumbo. Everyone else was half through their dinners before I got my dish. When it arrived, the only thing resembling gumbo was the rice. After the first taste, it was very bland and resembled some kind of creamy stew of unknown origin. Our waiter came by to ask if everything was okay, and how the gumbo was. After I told him it was so-so, he just asked ""just okay?"", smiled and walked away. No checking to see if I wanted something else instead. About halfway through the gumbo, I started to not feel well. Our group ordered dessert, which they were all gushing over after it arrived. Unfortunately, the girl up front never shared with anyone that it was my wife's birthday. I had to say something to the waiter who smiled, said Happy Birthday, came back after 5 minutes with a couple of waitresses, none of which looked thrilled to be there, sang happy birthday, dropped off what was supposed to be a sundae, and walked away. After a bit, my face started to swell, I grabbed a waitress to ask if they happened to put clams in the gumbo, which I am severely allergic to.  After checking with the chef, she came back to inform me that they put clam juice in it. Anyone who knows about gumbo knows that the classic recipe doesn't have any clams, or clam juice, in it. And, the menu has no claims of allergy causing foods. After a 20 minute ordeal of just trying to get the check so I could go get some pills from the nearby CVS, we were able to cash out and go. That was about the most embarassing and painful 20 minutes I've had in some time. When I first said something to the waitress, a woman came out from the back and simply said we're sorry, touched my shoulder, and went in the back again.  Our waiter came by, asked if anyone came by to say anything, and saw that I was having trouble seeing the bill to split it. He offered to split the bill for us. At no time did he offer to get a manager to come talk to us. Shortly after the waiter left, a manager did come over after hearing what happened from the woman in the back. He offered to comp my gumbo and my wife's cheesecake. Count me out from ever stepping foot in this overpriced carnival of lousy food and mediocre cheesecake. I'm from NY, and I've had better cheesecake out of the freezer at Costco. The staff was nice enough, incompetent, but nice. Glad they offered an apology and to comp part of the meal, but I'm still upset that I had to pay anything after this ordeal. NOTE: IF YOU HAVE FOOD ALERGIES, MAKE SURE TO ASK BECAUSE IT WON'T BE ON THE MENU!!!"
Elaine H.,"Surprise, AZ",0,67,,4.0,1/30/2012,"Cheesecake Factory offers good food and reliable, attentive service. I like that they offer reduced calorie items. Try the French Country salad and split a dessert to control the caloric damage. They have a tasty skinny margarita. They make good coffee. Also like the burgers and the sweet corn tamales. Exercise after. One thing - I wish they'd wipe down their menus more often."
Brian W.,"Glendale, AZ",3,3,,5.0,1/1/2013,"awesome tacos and salsa. oh the cheesecake took, well, the cake i guess"
