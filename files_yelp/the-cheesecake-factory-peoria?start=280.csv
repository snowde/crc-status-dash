Nick L.,"Peoria, AZ",62,20,,4.0,10/5/2011,"Of all the restaurants I've been to (and we eat out once or twice a week so we've sampled quite a few), Cheesecake Factory is the one that I've had the best service at, hands down, no matter the location.  Other restaurants might have service that is as good from time to time, but only at Cheesecake Factory has the service been excellent every single time I've been there. The food is also very good, and the menu has a lot of variety on it.  The one thing I don't like about it, though, is the ridiculous portion sizes/calorie counts.  I never finish an entire dinner meal (lunch for the next day, at least!) but even eating half of the portion I feel like I definitely shouldn't be ordering dessert.  They do have some lighter options, but not nearly as many as I've seen at similar restaurants.  Cheesecake Factory certainly is not helping obesity rates in our country, but with a little self-control I think it's a fabulous place to eat!"
Emily D.,"Washington, DC",81,169,12,2.0,5/8/2008,"First I hate when people call it ""Cheesecake"" as in, ""I am sacrificing a meal tonight and eating at Cheesecake.""  Please... Anyways... I have pretty good memories of this restaurant from childhood because back then I guess I didn't realize that it was a chain.  When I was a youngster in Michigan, it was always special to go to The Cheesecake Factory in Chicago and wait your 2 hours for a table and la te da.   Now, I realize that it is just one of the billions of chains on 83rd that is just sub par.   The last time I was there we ate an okay meal but had to wave our waiter down for water refills and earlier in the meal when he was taking our order, he actually sat down next to me while my boyfriend and I were ordering.  BIZARRE!  The guy clearly couldn't read body language. Huge Menu Huge place Loud Food that is just okay I know you can do better..."
Dave B.,"Peoria, AZ",1,5,,4.0,1/1/2014,This Cheesecake Factory has a great wide selection of food with large orders that are easy to share with my wife. The service is usually good and we really like sitting out on the outside patio. I highly recommend this location opposed to other locations I've been to.
April H.,"Peoria, AZ",5,62,,3.0,9/11/2011,"We don't visit CKF very often, simply because it's very overpriced and crowded.  I do love their Chicken Piccata and macaroni cheese bites though.  They have a very large menu....at times overwhelming."
Paul B.,"Goodyear, AZ",1,15,,4.0,12/11/2013,"The best ""go to"" meal on a Sunday period.  We love the food...and the service is stellar.  We have been going to this location for the past 7 years and have never had a bad experience."
Amy D.,"Phoenix, AZ",1371,357,15,2.0,2/14/2008,"I have to agree with everyone.  The menu is extensive, which is a good thing.  No matter who you go with, you'll all find something you like. BUT I hate the atmosphere.  I hate the crowd.  I hate the NOISE!  I feel like part of a herd of cattle there. They have one salad I like.  It's got walnuts, pears and a good raspberry vinaigrette.   The cheesecake?  Well, being from NY, I find it mediocre.   I got a gift card for CF last year for my birthday.  I re-gifted it."
Donald W.,"Glendale, AZ",70,9,,4.0,4/12/2010,The Cheesecake Factory has an incredible variety of choices. Everything I have tried here is consistently well done with large portions. They always have great service and of course the desserts are off the charts!
Stevey P.,"San Diego, CA",641,553,79,2.0,5/22/2007,"So I've admitted in the Biltmore location's review that I secretly LOVE Cheesecake Factory, but this particular location stinks.   Lunch is always busy, and service (up to now) was so-so.  But most recently my co-workers took me to lunch here for my birthday, and here is how the exchange with our 22 year old skanky server went. I swear I am not making this up.  We place our orders and then my co-workers call over our server.  Let's call the 22 year old skanky server Tammy McSleazerston. Co-workers:  (point over at me like I'm not there, as if to request some kind of retarded ice cream, song and dance freebie) It's his birthday today, could we have some kind of something for him. TM:  (In baby voice, and taking her index finger and pointing at her right cheek) Aww, is it your boothday tuhday Mishtuh Man?? Me:  (Stunned, and not knowing what to say)  Um yeah. TM says she'll be back, and walks away. Me and Co workers:  (Look at each other jaw-dropped) We finish lunch, they give me my stupid ice cream, and we leave a crappy tip and a note to the manager to rein in his flippant servers -- and no apology, or other response."
Jon M.,"Glendale, AZ",8,5,,4.0,1/21/2011,"Food was great, quoted a half hour wait ended up being half that long.  Service left a bit to be desired sittingon the patio but at least they weren't over bearing."
Brandon S.,"Peoria, AZ",5,32,20,4.0,3/17/2011,I had southwest salad.  red velvet cheesecake mmmmmmm
C E.,"Glendale, AZ",1,60,3,3.0,5/20/2014,"Im going to update my review because I have had a few more visits under my belt. Dinner is definitely overpriced. And the menu is too long. They should focus on a smaller variety of foods. Entrees arent consistent. On my last visit my boyfriends dinner came out ten minutes after the rest of the table. The waiter didn't come back to check on him, and since someone else was taking care of our table for the first half of the dining experience, his food had cheese on it even though he asked for no cheese upon ordering. He needed more sauce, as his pasta was dry. Nobody to be found until everyone was finished eating. Too late to ask. A quick and insincere apology for the missing entre. Nothing taken off the bill, nothing else  offered. I always get the same thing, thai lettuce wraps. My chicken was tough and overcooked. A little dissapointed as this is my favorite dish ever. My moms favorite dish came out tasting funny. (Too tomato-y? Or maybe it didnt have enough tomato flavor? I dont remember but my sister got the same thing and said it tasted different as well). We ordered three cheesecakes which were fantastic as always. This is obviously the best part of the meal and the only thing my family comes for. Come for the cheesecake, not the dinners!"
Louise O.,"San Francisco, CA",23,257,10,3.0,8/25/2006,"Gawd, I hate this place. Ok, the cheesecake is decent. But the entire place is such a machine and not a very well oiled one at that.  But my #1 pet PEEVE about this place, and it COMPLETELY irks me, is that they have advertisements in their menus!!  Are you KIDDING me?! For that alone, I feel like they should be paying me to eat there.  The food is just okay. It is what it is. An ""upscale"", soulless chain.  Unless absolutely forced to by a huge group of crazy people that don't enjoy eating, will I eat here. Ok, maybe an exaggeration. If I had to choose between Subway and this, I guess I'd go for Cheesecake Factory."
Angela G.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,48,1,4.0,9/1/2012,Stopped in for lunch. Had the chopped salad. Awesome!! Cannot say enough about this place! Beautiful restaurant and excellent service!  Will see you again soon!
Kimberly S.,"Glendale, AZ",14,23,,2.0,7/3/2008,"I went to this restaurant a couple of years back and had a much better experience with both the service and food.  This time it was quite a disappointment.  Much smaller portions and everything tasted the same.  Food was not presented in an appealing manner (kind of slopped on the plate...what's up with that?!) and as usual, martinis waaay over priced.  I don't mind paying for expensive alcohol, but the food better be up to par or the waiter/ress better be over par.  It seems the quality over all with this particular CF has gone down over the years."
Russell M.,"Surprise, AZ",0,8,,5.0,7/28/2011,"We ate a late lunch here on Tuesday. Arrived around 2:30pm and were seated immediately. My wife had the salmon lunch special with mashed potatoes and a small green salad. It was all delicious. I had the BLT Salad and it was also very good. Service was good as well. For dessert my wife had the standard cheesecake and I had the carrot cake. They were both incredible. This is a wonderful place to eat with good food, a good atmosphere, good service and great desserts."
John A.,"Seattle, WA",17,111,2,2.0,10/7/2006,The only good thing is the cheesecake. The food is terribly mediocre. And I hate how they seem to all be decorated like ruins of some sort. I want some damn food not an expedition with Fernando!
Lizard Q.,"Glendale, AZ",0,31,,4.0,9/8/2011,"My boyfriend and i just ate there afew hours ago and it was great.our server was very nice and sweet.they served my soda in a huge glass and refilled it as needed without me having to ask.the wheat bread they give you before dinner is awesome.the white not so good.I ordered off thier new light menu.(called skinny something or other don't remember)I had the chicken soft tacos.they were excellent.I couldn't even tell they were low cal.they also had cabbage in them and the cilantro was seasoned nicely to add lots of   b.f. ordered a burger well done and it was cooked just right.I never eat burgers but I tried a bite of his just to see,and it tasted great,like it was fresh off the grill.the rice that came with my tacos was very flavorful and a good size portion as well.the only complaint I had was that as I sat down,I noticed a lil black hair on my napkin/linen.luckilly I saw it before I used it.I asked for a new one and the server was nice and apologetic about it.honestly it was so small I can see how it was overlooked.these things happen.I don't blame anyone for that.overall it was a good dining experience .(minus the hair of course)."
laura b.,"Glendale, AZ",3,114,,2.0,9/17/2008,"my boyfriend has wanted to take me to this restaurant for 3 years. we finally went on a special occasion. i was looking forward to a really good meal and nice ambiance. ok, so the food was way overpriced for what you got. we went for breakfast. the portion was average, nothing spectacular and it was pricey for what you got. the service was super slow. yes, it was busy, however, it was slower then slow. it was very noisy, putting a damper on our special occasion. the decor was the only nice thing about the visity. service blew. prices blew. nothing special. i could've went to a hole in the wall diner and got a heaping portion for less money and better service."
