Oz F.,"New River, AZ",0,19,,5.0,9/11/2017,"The food tasted so good. Fresh hot bread was  delightful. The server was nice, the place was SO CROWDED, and loud, we got seated quickly, and the Tropical Ice Tea is heavenly!!  Employees were hopping, and very considerate and helpful."
Ryan W.,"Surprise, AZ",177,93,480,1.0,6/10/2017,"Arrived at The Cheesecake Factory at 12:15pm this Saturday. We had a party of five (No it's not the tv show). We were seated immediately and waited five minutes for bread and ten minutes for drinks. Our order was taken five minutes after our drinks were dropped off. I do enjoy the wheat bread here and their house lemonade with sugar on the rim. Our orders were taken, after 40 minutes of waiting we'd all had enough. As I stood to go grab a manager the waiter explained  ""Your order is on its way!"" From where? Antarctica!? I asked the girls at reception for a manager, he showed up quickly. I was extremely kind, but very matter of fact with him about the time it had taken to receive our food. The manager walked back to my table with me as three waiters scurried to quickly place the food on the table. The manager abruptly left, not cool! The food was warm and tasted fine, however there where several mistakes with our orders including hair in my wife's food, right on top of her steak. We didn't receive a discount or even an apology. I won't be coming back to this location!"

Claudio F.,"Niles, IL",24,8,4,1.0,5/21/2017,"The 1 star is definitely not for the customer service. Our server was really nice and sweet. The bad review was for the food, its for the taste and quality of the food. We ate at other locations before but never extremely impressed with the food, but at this location I ordered the burrito. I was fighting all night to keep it down, in the end the burrito won. The food was disgusting  and what wasn't disgusting had no taste at all whatsoever.  There were 7 of us total, and everyone was complaining of their food. My main question for the cook is how on earth can you cook the black beans, and make them tasteless? Definitely not planning to visit this location anytime soon. The time wasted waiting for a table and then paying a crapload of $ for crappy food. Not worth it."
Cherry G.,"Peoria, AZ",2,16,,4.0,8/10/2017,"It's been a little while since I was here. I always liked to sit in the little room off to the side-it's quieter. Service was always ok. I always got my favorite,the Chicken Madeira,and it was really good and satisfying. My friend had a Cuban sandwich and really liked it. Of course,you can't leave there without trying the many varieties of cheesecake.  Everything we've tried has been really good,but my favorite ones are always the chocolate ones- godiva,chocolate tuxedo,and chocolate mousse. They have a lot of choices in appetizers,entrees,and desserts. They even carry low carb cheesecake."
Toni O.,"Saint Johns, AZ",24,15,4,5.0,1/12/2017,Always good food. Always just right feels like something is happening but not too loud. Giving our server Ana C a shout out. She was wonderful - friendly and knowledgeable.
Heather J.,"Avondale, AZ",95,280,66,4.0,1/10/2017,This place has the biggest menu ever! Too much to decide on. I love the stuffed mushrooms and most of the appetizer menu the most. I have never had a drink here but they look delicious too. And of course you have to have a piece of cheesecake.
Aldo G.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,17,,1.0,6/18/2017,Came here for Father's Day brunch  Just 2 of us Sat down. No wait at 1030am.  Then no server. Amazing how like 20-30 people walk by without acknowledging us.  Crazy thing is ive been here before and this happens often. It consistently sucks here.  Finally ordered. What's the point. Our server never put in our order then went to take a huge tables order. We waited. No drinks came. Not even a water.  Manager doesn't even notice.  We walk out. The girl who sat us says thanks for coming. Get a brain. You just sat us 30 min prior and no one came to help us.  This place is on auto pilot and it's crashing!
James M.,"Phoenix, AZ",1178,188,285,4.0,7/22/2017,"Great Food always, but can be a pain for long waits on getting seated as well as waiting for food.  Wish they'd stay on top of drink refills more, but their staff is usually younger and learning how to be a waiter/waitress usually."
Christal B.,"Phoenix, AZ",54,44,70,5.0,1/22/2017,"You could eat here everyday for a month & get something different every time. Something great, hearty, sweet, filling, easy or quick. This place has something for everyone. Love love love this place for family night!!!"
Sheri B.,"Peoria, AZ",15,47,3,2.0,5/26/2017,Food has deteriorated and service at this location isn't great. The manager has no clue what's going on in his restaurant. There are way too many choices to come back here again.
Anthony C.,"Surprise, AZ",1,3,3,5.0,3/15/2017,"The  !!! Eat here, leave happy!! The food will put you in a food coma! Cat fish was da bomb!"
Elizabeth N.,"Tucson, AZ",118,78,165,4.0,6/4/2016,Definitely loved the service. Our waitress was consistently attentive and our food was really great. They were very accommodating to large parties. Great food and a great time.
Heather J.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,9,,1.0,10/30/2017,"This was our go-to place when family came to town, good assortment of foods on the menu.  The last two times have been awful and as a group decision we won't return.  The Calamari was tasteless, without a doubt the worst I ever  ate.  The kids mac and cheese was gross, like white cream sauce, not cheesy at all.  You know it's bad when the kids say ewe, something is bad with this mom.  Flatbread hardly had anything on it. Manager did take food off the bill but that doesn't make a person want to return."
Jo Ann M.,"Surprise, AZ",0,14,,4.0,10/29/2017,"It was such a great surprise to see we have The Cheesecake Factory not too far from home in Surprise, Az. Great ambiance, with hardly a wait! The food is just as I remembered it from when I was a patron in Thousand Oaks, Ca. Always great food. This visit we had the pleasure to be waited on by Brenda. Thank you Brenda for helping us choose the right menu items, and your terrific service! We look forward to visiting again soon. My wish list would be for The Cheesecake Factory to open in Surprise, Arizona! We sure could use a quality restaurant like The Cheesecake Factory in our town."

Brian H.,"Peoria, AZ",112,180,32,2.0,5/2/2017,"Our experience was not what we have come to expect from our past experience. It started out bad and ended bad. Service was very slow we sat there waiting to place our drink order for over 15 minutes. It took another 10-15 minutes to get our sodas.  We asked to place our order then and she said ""I will be right back I have a thats order up."" shes gone for about 10 minutes and takes are order and had to ask for refills on are drinks. Are food took a long time to came out my Pit Beef sandwich was VERY TUFF my wife had the shrimp scampi it was okay the shrimp was a little over cooked a little rubbery. She did not come back to check on us or refill our drinks. We wanted desert but it took so long we were unable. Very disappointed on food and service."
CheRich R.,"Peoria, AZ",34,76,118,2.0,11/28/2016,Wow never had bad things to say about this cheesecake until today.. got cold hardened pasta like it sat all day. I showed waiter and he had manager come and the manager did not seem interested much. You could tell he was just doing the bare minimum as he seemed liked we were interrupted him. My husband was done eating by the time my food came out still looking substandard. The manager brought the plate and Comp the dish but his presence was the same. While preparing to leave I overheard the couple next to us say to another group their food was overcooked and both groups said waste of time and money. They told manager as well and again he seemed uncaring just saying oh wow sorry yet in a fake tone.
Ronald E.,"Glendale, AZ",0,8,,1.0,1/21/2017,Went there for my birthday dinner.  Server acted like we were the first table he ever took an order from.  He was very unsure of himself.   Food was presented cool not warm or hot like it should have been.  I ordered the shrimp and pasta dish.  Shrimp were cold and smaller than I would have liked.  My spouse's entree had very little flavor.  Salt helped. Didn't order dessert as they already had too much of my money.  Probably will never go back.  Very disappointed and on my birthday to boot.
Kevin S.,"Surprise, AZ",0,5,,2.0,10/17/2017,"I took my family of four here this past Sunday for lunch.  The best part was the fancy building, but that's about it.  My wife ordered french toast. She didn't like it...too much bread and lacking in flavor.  My son ordered a Belgian waffle and liked it.  I ordered hot wings from the appetizer menu.  I would say they were ok. Nothing special...a little dry and not very spicy.  My daughter ordered steak Diane.  She was disappointed....3 shrimp, sticky mashed potatoes, and small portion of steak pieces, many of the pieces under-cooked.  The waitress seemed as if she had too many tables to cover.  We rarely saw her and she really wasn't that pleasant.  After the meal was served by kitchen staff, nobody came around to ask how things were.  The icing on the cake for me was when my wife and daughter wanted Oreo milkshakes to-go.  Took an extra 15 minutes and they were brought to us in cheap little plastic cups.  They seemed like they had sat for a while and had started to melt a little.  When the bill came, I was shocked to see a $95 dollar bill.....way too much for what we ordered!  The only expensive meal was my daughter's steak at $22.  Each of the pathetic milkshakes was $8.  Seriously?  My wife and son each had what I would call a cheap breakfast.  This meal should have cost no more than $50 at most.  I paid the bill and we proceeded to drive home.  The more I drove, the more upset my wife and I became.  I hate wasting money...which is exactly what I did.  My wife said that I should drive back and tell someone, but I declined.  I wasn't optimistic that management would care.  My family felt bad.  I told them that they are worth $100, but the meal I just paid for was certainly not.  I guess that YELP is my way to vent a little.  I told my family that next time, we should just go to Denny's if they're going to order simple breakfast items and I'll save $60.  I'm still angry about paying almost $20 for two puny milkshakes.  That's absurd!  I object to paying a premium price for sub-par service and mediocre-level food.  I still haven't decided if I will ever be back.  I'm pretty frustrated right now."
