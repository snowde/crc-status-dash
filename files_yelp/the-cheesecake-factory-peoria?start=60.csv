Alyssa C.,"Glendale, AZ",0,10,1,2.0,7/16/2017,"I am sorry I am only giving you guys two stars... I always feel bad to do this... but the pricing is not at all worth it. The ambiance is amazing and the cheesecake is of course amazing but as far as the actual food goes, I don't suggest eating here :/. It is way to expensive and not worth it to be honest. Good news is that the employees are very kind and attentive!"
Sofia A.,"Tempe, AZ",0,3,,5.0,10/10/2017,"The food was so amazing. There was an issue with one of the appetizers, but the manager was kind enough to come out and speak to us about it. He apologized for it and was generous enough to take care of it. Overall my sister and I had an amazing date and we will definitely be back! Great service and great experience!!"
Tim S.,"Surprise, AZ",111,1122,1495,4.0,1/28/2016,"So.......we wanted to go out to lunch, but we didn't want to spend a lot of money.  Remembered that we had received some gift cards from the in laws for the Cheesecake Factory.  Problem solved!  I had not yet been to this Cheesecake Factory since moving out to AZ.  We would go to the one in Mission Valley occasionally and the food/service was usually pretty good.  We came down here to this one today for a late lunch. We arrived at around 3:00 and there weren't too many people there.  We got a seat immediately at a table and the waitress brought over the high chair.  We placed our order for drinks (waters, and my wife got an iced tea), got some bread delivered (sourdough and a honey oat type brown bread) and placed our order.  I had been scoping out the Yelp reviews and pictures online prior to arrival, and I saw a few pictures of fish tacos.  I had yet to have fish tacos since I moved to AZ, and they looked legit, and sounded legit, so I went with those.  My wife got a lunch sized portion of the pasta carbonara with chicken.  About 15 minutes later, our food was arrived.  Here is how it was.................. Fish Tacos-  These things looked great!  They hook you up with 4 nice sized tacos!  They came with double wrapped corn tortillas, a nice piece of tempura fried white fish which was both crunchy outside and moist inside,  some pickled onions and a little dollop of guacamole.  They usually come with a chipotle sauce, but I skipped that.  The tacos were mighty fine as they were.  Everything worked well!  They were legit fish tacos.  Maybe not as good as TJ Oyster Bar in SD, but they were damn good and better than a lot of fish tacos I have had.  I really liked the pickled onions!  They gave a nice little sweetness to the taco and they were buried under the actual fish.  These tacos were well constructed and just the right size to fill me up but not overstuff me.  The tacos also came with some black beans, and a side of ""green tint"" rice.  I sampled the beans, they were alright.  The rice had a unique seasoning to it.  Almost tasted a bit like pesto sauce, but then I caught a taste of something else.  Definitely unique, but I didn't finish all of it, mostly because I'm not the hugest fan of rice and/or beans. Pasta Carbonara-  My wife thought it was a bit too ""oily"" so she couldn't finish it all.  I took her bowl of pasta from her and proceeded to have some.  I thought it was fine!  It had a nice sauce, lots of bacon, a little bit of chicken and a ton of peas in it.  I am anti pea, so I ate around all of those.  The noodles, bacon, sauce and chicken were very good.  I couldn't see myself eating a whole bowl of this (reason my wife couldn't finish it either) because it was pretty heavy, but a half portion or if you split this with someone, it was pretty tasty. Service was fine.  Not great, not poor.  A-OK!  Total for everything was $0.00 thanks to the gift cards!  We skipped dessert and were on our way.  I would definitely come back and probably order the same thing.  Those fish tacos were no joke!  They were delicious as could be!"
Analynn S.,"Peoria, AZ",64,106,11,2.0,5/9/2017,"Hey Hey Hey Az I gave this place a two star rating today not because of the service or ambience , that's always great ! My disappointment was with the quality of the food . Today's order was Shelia's  Cashew Chicken Salad and the soup of the day . Tomato basil chicken tortilla soup. On the menu Sheila's Cashew Chicken salad sounded great but when it was received it lacked lusciousness . Chicken ? Hardly any and it was shaved not chucks . It called for avocados and they were MIA"" !  All I tasted was a mouth full of crispy tortilla chips . The soup of the day was tasteful but the chicken in the soup was ""MIA as well . What the heck . At the end of the day it was just mediocre and I was going for ""WOW""."
Jennifer C.,"Goodyear, AZ",2,17,6,5.0,3/18/2016,"My Husband and I came last night for dinner to celebrate our 6th wedding anniversary. We planned this evening out right after Christmas when we received several gift cards from family.     The place was pretty busy, but we decided to stay. We were seated promptly which was very nice. We were told that someone would be with us shortly as usual. After 10 minutes and 2 birthday celebrations we were both shocked to find that no one was tending to us. We decided to just wait and see if someone would be coming to our table then. Seems we were seated at a bust time maybe? After 22 minutes I got up and went to the gal that seated us. I let her know that we had been sitting there the whole time with no one to tend to us. Immediately the manager turned around and apologized. Promised to make our evening very nice. As we walked to the table I noticed a server talking to my Husband. We agreed to stay and attempt to enjoy our visit.    I know things happen and you can't take it personally. We didn't. I'm glad we stayed because our server and the manager took really good care of us. Our server was very friendly and made us feel better. We respected her and gave her a fair opportunity. We had the calamari for an appetizer. It was brought to our table immediately. It was hot and fresh. The 2 sauces were delicious. We will order it again!    I had the skinny chicken pasta and Hubby had the chicken di pana. Both dishes were very tasty. We both enjoyed our dishes, but wish we had switched plates at some point. We decided to share a piece of Kahlua cheesecake and take a piece of the lemon meringue cheesecake home. Great idea!     Even though our evening started out rough, the service and food was worth it all. Our server and the manager definitely made our evening very enjoyable and fun. We are very thankful for the experience and are planning to return soon. Thank you to everyone for another great experience!"
Alice M.,"Sun City, AZ",0,3,,1.0,2/24/2017,"We went there Saturday. We were seated and waited over an hour for our meals.  There were 3 adults & 2 children.   We ordered salads & soup!!!!   Should NOT take over an hour.  Also 3 tables that came in AFTER us had their meals before us????? When my soup & salad came there was NO sour dough bread.  Waitress said it didn't come with bread?   I got a menu again and it DID come with sour dough bread!  I told waitress that & she said. ""I never saw that before""??????    I will NEVER go to  Hesse are factory again!!!"
Chris C.,"Surprise, AZ",44,22,41,2.0,4/14/2017,"Afternoon lunch gone bad 4 my company.  Usually a great day here but alas not today. My mom tried her favorite dish orange chicken but it had to be sent back twice.  Even when asking for sauce when the dish was remade it was an epic fail, cold sauce.  This meal was like adding injury to insult 4 here. Our waitress really tried to make it better. My firecracker salmon was yummy. Dad's meal was good 2. The manager did stop to try to make sure she was ok and so paying for what she did try on her meal. Alas no leftovers or meal 4 mom here today."
Rick T.,"Litchfield Park, AZ",760,260,1316,1.0,7/4/2016,"Now let me start by saying I did not order cheesecake on my visit. The desserts looked amazing and probably taste the same, but today's visit was for dinner only. I would add though that I would have ordered dessert if the dang dinner was not priced so high. I have no issue with paying top dollar for a great meal, but this was far from.  My wife and I ordered farfalle with chicken and the four cheese pasta with two meatballs. These two entrees were far from good.  Both, yes both, lacked any flavor. ANY FLAVOR!! The bread provided before the meal had more.  The four cheese pasta with meatballs tasted like it was just pulled from the microwave.  My wife's meal was no different.  To top it off, it was $21 for my pathetic dish and $17 for hers.  What a joke!!!! For a total of nearly $50, we had two sodas and two bad dishes.  After using a $25 gift card (reason for visit), I still feel like I was ripped off."
Christina S.,"Surprise, AZ",1,12,,2.0,6/7/2017,"I've been to this location several times with great meals & service so I was anticipating more of the same along with fun date-time with hubby. Unfortunately this was not to be. I had ordered the eggplant  parmigiana  along w side of pasta (substituted marinara for pesto).  Eggplant parmigiana was so very disappointing; thick, overcooked hockey puck-like slices & the angel hair pasta had no sauce. There was no flavor whatsoever in small amount of sauce there was so I sent it back & ordered Chinese Chicken Salad which arrived with no dressing at which time I asked to have it packed up to go along w some dressing.  Hubby's Lettuce Wraps were great though."
Kimberly S.,"Atlanta, GA",711,823,2257,3.0,1/7/2016,"I don't care what y'all say. This place is just average. They give you huge portions, but the food isn't/aint nothing special. I love the brownie and the chocolate cake though. Therefore, 3 Star!"
Brad W.,"Scottsdale, AZ",203,1514,1940,3.0,6/21/2016,"This was the least crowded of all the chains on Father's day - only a 30 minute wait at 3pm and we weren't even celebrating that holiday. Usually pretty solid choice, but some missteps in the food today. The glaring issue was a fly in the ice tea. My lunch Luoa salad sounded good on paper, but did not cut the mustard in person. It had three large wontons, but was lacking chicken and contained too much cabbage for a salad. Other people got the club sandwich and they use good quality meats, but the best part was the $5.95 stuffed mashed potato balls. Large menu, but still best to stick to the favorites and not go too far off track."
Kendra B.,"Peoria, AZ",0,4,,1.0,6/30/2016,"My husband is allergic to carrots and informed the waitress. He ordered the hibachi steak which does not come with carrots. This should have been simple. When it arrived, they had replaced the asparagus...with carrots. We sent it back, of course, and I sat watching my food get cold and he sat staring at his empty glass (because the server completely stopped doing her job). When the dish arrived for the second time, it had absolutely no vegetables, so the dish was not even complete as presented on the menu--when we asked the manager about it, his response was, ""Well, they were so worried about getting the steak out."" The result of all of this is that we left the steak on the bar and went to another restaurant for dinner. I am usually a big fan of Cheesecake Factory--but the apathy tonight on the part of the staff and the management will keep me from going back to this location."
Nikki P.,"Laveen Village, AZ",0,23,,2.0,3/27/2017,"My sister recently moved to the Phoenix area and I thought about taking her out to a restaurant that she has never tried.  We decided to go to The Cheesecake Factory location off Bell/83rd ave.  The only reason why I gave this place 2 stars is because the waiter was nice, we sat outside (on a very beautiful day), therefore the decor was to my taste.  We both ordered meatloaf dinners.  Although it was quite a bit of food, the meatloaf was burnt to a crisp (not attractive at all) and the appetizer came out AFTER the dinner.  I thought that was supposed to come out before the dinner entree.  IF I ever do return and my plate comes out burnt again, they probably won't like me very much, because I will keep sending it back until they get it right.  I still paid for my meal and tipped my waiter, but they could have done a lot better with my food."
Jessica G.,"Long Beach, CA",86,157,204,1.0,7/15/2016,"Went on 7/14 (Thursday) for a friends 19th Birthday. It was only a party of 4, we waited about 20 minutes which is normal since it was about 8ish. Our ""waiter"" was by far the worst I've ever experienced at any establishment. It took him a while to get to our table to take our drink requests. Which was okay seeing as we determined what to order. When he FINALLY came over he took our drink orders then started to walk away with out acknowledging he was going to be right back. I said ""I think we're ready to order"" and he turned back around and said ""I have other tables to attend to!"" First of all. What the heck. I've never in my life have I had to deal with such a mannerless individual, especially in the food/customer service industry. 15 minutes later he finally arrives with our drinks and again walked away with no acknowledgement. Another 15 minutes later he finally felt like taking our order and finally gave us a bread basket which only had two slices of bread. Reminder there's a total of 4 people in our party.  You could clearly tell he was in a bad mood and was taking it out on his guests. He took our order and my friend asked for a burger with no onions and mustard. She got it backward with onions and no mustard. When she told the ""waiter"" he didn't even right it down and barely acknowledged her simple request. At this point we were very upset at how much of a jerk this guy was being and totally took away from our birthday celebration. We ate or food and at the point when we had already finished he finally comes around to ask how food was. Like really? Usually you get asked about 5 min later.  We were so pissed we didn't even get a cheesecake which was the only reason we wanted to eat there in the first plAce. Not that the ""waiter"" even offered us any dessert in the first place. If your having a bad day leave your issues at the door or if you hate your job then promote yourself to customer. But goodness cheesecake company should be ashamed of this specific worker!! Who knows how many other people ruined their dinners as well.  Also, I can't begin to describe how filthy our table and area was!!!! There was some type of slime stuff on the floor that my friend stepped in and had dirty shoes. We all had to watch where we stepped for the floor under or table was so nasty and obviously not cleaned or mopped. What a joke. I won't be coming back soon."
Cris L.,"Glendale, AZ",100,13,1,3.0,9/6/2017,"We had an amazing server named Justin and it just so happened to be his birthday when we went in. He was great, but the food. Uh uh. Cooks need to regroup. My shrimp and garlic with a touch of marinara was no where close to that. Shrimp was over cooked TWICE, like rubber. And it wasn't a touch of marinara it was like a lotta marinara. Even though the manager came by, he was quick about how everything came out then off he went. Just a courtesy stop I guess to make me feel better but wasn't interested in details. Oh well. Last time @ any Cheesecake Factory for me. Sorry."
Howard O.,"Sun City West, AZ",0,20,2,4.0,4/13/2017,"Food is great.  Servers are friendly & knowledgeable.  Service was smooth but not to quick. The portions, for what we ordered, were large and we took some home. Outside dining is a little noisy, because it faces 83rd ave, but tolerable. The noise did not interfere with conversation. I especially like the Calamari appetizer and of course the deserts."
Jessica L.,"Peoria, AZ",43,1,3,2.0,8/26/2017,"Not a bad place to eat but defiantly not worth the price!!! My brother and I came here to place a to go order tonight. We ordered the chicken and shrimp gumbo and the southern fried catfish. Just before ordering my brother confirmed with one of the employees about the size of the fish fillets in which they replied saying ""the pieces of fish are pretty big."" The meal came with three thin chicken strip sized pieces of fish that in addition were each very bland. Moving on to my dish, the gumbo, I found the consistency to be very water like and the only flavor that came through was the tomatoes and the few pieces of andouille sausage. However, the rice was cooked nicely and the sides that came with the catfish were fine as well! I could just be very picky because I grew up on catfish Friday's and grandmas gumbo but Cheesecake charged me over 40 dollars for this meal. They could have at least came close to grandmas gumbo and gave me pieces of fish worth the charge of $18."
T H.,"Phoenix, AZ",2,12,,2.0,3/7/2017,"I ordered the Beef Medallions off of the Skinnylicious menu and it was so not worth the money. I understand they want to keep the calories low, but 4 small pieces of beef and less than a forkful of mashed potatoes was not worth $17.50. The manager was a complete jerk when I talked to him about it. Buyer beware on that menu item."
Marina S.,"North Mountain Village, Phoenix, AZ",37,4,3,1.0,7/30/2017,"I have been to this Cheesecake Factory 3 times. The wait time is always between 30 to 50 min no matter if it is the week or weekend, middle of the afternoon or evening. The food is good but so expensive for what it is! Today i ordered skinnylicious pasta which costed $16, you should have seen the amount of pasta I got, it was ridiculous. 4 bites and it was gone and the worse part is that I ordered mushroom with it and they charged me $4 for it! What the heck!! I like the atmosphere, food is good but the price is not worth the food. Service is ok ... I will not go back to this place!"
Eric T.,"Washington, UT",212,12,6,1.0,2/14/2017,"Worst service I have ever received. If I could give them 0 or negative stars I would. We came on Valentine's, and yes I know it's one of the busiest days, but we waited in line like everyone else. Apparently Hilary, who took our name down, did not tag our pager to our name so we sat next to the restaurant waiting for it to go off approximately 45 minutes past the expected wait time. She stated that they called our name but we were listening intently, as we knew they were very busy, but never heard our name called once. When we went up to talk to her she said she would ""fix"" it by putting us next in line. However, as expected the next couple who got seated arrived after us. Once we finally got seated, the man who seated us asked us about our night, so I responded with that we were fine but frustrated about what had happened. His response was ""its excepted and it happens."" I'm not in customer service but any one with an sort of intelligence would know not to respond like that. The food was average. DO NOT EVER COME HERE EXPECTING CUSTOMER SERVICE OF ANY KIND."
