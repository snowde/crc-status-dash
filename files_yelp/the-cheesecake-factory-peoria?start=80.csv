Spencer G.,"Kent, WA",0,7,1,5.0,2/11/2017,"Delicious meal. Came here with my girlfriend and we had an amazing time. Very classy, friendly people, they make sure you feel welcome and respected from the time you enter to when you leave. Because of their delicious food and classy staff, they're very busy. I would suggest a reservation if you don't want to have a long wait. They have a wide variety of cheesecakes and are so delicious."
Michelle S.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,6,17,3.0,3/7/2017,"Came here on V-Day. Which obviously is going to be very busy. I'm not rating on how long I waited to be seated or the food which was cooked wrong btw but I understand the cooks had a lot on their hands so I'll let it pass by. I am rating our waiter that night. It was an ok service. However, even though it was busy, the waiter wasn't attending to the whole restaurant which I had no clue why he wasn't around much in our area when we needed to be attended to. The other 4 couples that were there also didn't experience much of him. Took him 20 minutes to get me a soda and when he came back I asked him about it and he had forgotten about it. He did apologize but man, what if I choked on my food though? We did leave him a very good tip but tbh it wasn't worth the service."
Nancy G.,"Peoria, AZ",17,6,2,2.0,8/7/2017,"I usually like this place, but today was very disappointing. I give 2 stars because our waiter was very nice. My husband's chicken picatta was bland. He did like his onion soup. I ordered shrimp with angel hair pasta. I thought that is what I ordered. I showed the waiter on a particular page. I showed him shrimp with angel hair pasta but when I was served my lunch, it looked odd. It was soggy breaded shrimp on the side in little sauce, burnt sauce pieces and whole garlic cloves and a Luke warm ball of the pasta. The shrimp coating was pasty/soggy and had a weird flavor. I flagged the waiter and we reviewed the ordering/food quality situation. We decided I ordered the Scampi which has the breaded shrimp and whole garlic cloves. Whatever. He brought me 6 nicely sauteed shrimp which was brought after I ate the slightly warm ball of pasta. I didn't want to complain too much as to not further make my husband uncomfortable. It is hard enough that he needs gluten free so I was clear and took blame for the wording of my order though what I was pointing to and reading from the menu was not the item I was served. Even though I told our waiter the pasta was not hot, he did not offer to fix that. They were also out of soup spoons and offered my husband a tea spoon or a pasta (large spoon). Very weird. That happened when I had soup there 3 months ago. The ladies restroom was dirty and trash can over flowing with trash on the sink and floor. I let them know the ladies room needed attention as I was leaving. The waiter was very nice and 80% attentive. It was an expensive lunch. Not sure if we will go back. I am a former restaurant professional instructor and shopper. I try and not be too critical."
Naomi N.,"Surprise, AZ",69,9,5,1.0,3/3/2017,"Was here for my sons birthday. Came with a party ordered apps, drinks, and meals... they don't even cover a birthday dessert... pretty disappointing..."
Mark O.,"Yorba Linda, CA",106,178,850,5.0,8/2/2014,"NEW menu item - Mediterranean Flatbread Sandwich. Includes lean ground beef, marinated onions, tzatziki, feta cheese on warm flatbread. Four, 3-bite pieces are just enough to leave room for a few piping hot frites which also come with this meal. $12.95 is certainly reasonable. Highly recommend. Ask to be seated in Steven R's section. He's good. Oh, and maybe some cheese cake for desert. I'll work that off on Camelback Mountain tomorrow."
Donald M.,"El Mirage, AZ",15,1,,3.0,2/21/2017,"Your name says what you do best and I understand that, you want that dinner crowd. And I'm gonna say this as nice as I can when you cook for people the least you can do is to use seasonings. A little salt and a little pepper can go a long way. If you don't wanna use salt you can use things like onions garlic and shallots. Ps switch to a better grade of ground beef your Sheppard pie was swimming in grease. The only reason I gave you a three cause your cheesecake can't be matched by no one."
Fran J.,"Sun City, AZ",15,7,2,5.0,2/14/2017,"One of my favs , staff outstanding, 150 sauces made daily,  a book for a menu ,and then there is the cheesecake if u'v got room. Enjoy ."
Bob M.,"Peoria, AZ",62,82,47,2.0,8/30/2015,"Breakfast was just okay.  Weird bowl of fruit though. Really small cut on the fruit and it had a weird taste.  Service was also slow today. It took 45 minutes to get eggs, toast and fruit? They have good dinners here but I'm going back to MiMi's or Black Bear Diner for breakfast."
Katt T.,"Murrieta, CA",1,25,2,5.0,10/2/2016,Came here for lunch and it was a nice and relaxing experience. The hostess was pleasant and our waitress was very attentive. We got a few appetizers for our meal and it was absolutely delicious! Only con was the Alcoholic beverages is a little overpriced
Frank M.,"Old Ballard, Seattle, WA",20,9,,4.0,6/25/2017,We went to this restaurant for a dessert date with some friends we have not seen in year or so. We talked so much . We finished desert and were going to order a appetizer but talked son much catching up we close the joint. The cheese cake was out of this world.
Norma Q.,"Phoenix, AZ",40,15,110,5.0,9/18/2015,"My nephew Eli will now be 24. My daughter Ruby is deciding where to take him. She went with cheesecake factory because of the menu selecion. Everything here is so delicios. We had a very good time, starting from appetizers, main course and desert. A very nice group, including moms, nephews and daughter. We come here often and will continue to come.  Tanks Cheesecake factory"
John K.,"Fenton, MI",1,21,,2.0,4/5/2017,I try to plan ahead and look at the menu before I go to the restaurante. The two items I wanted I was told were not served anymore. They should update their menu when changes are made.I walked out. Went next door to F.Daves no dissapointments.
William Y.,"El Paso, TX",10,14,11,4.0,8/2/2016,The place is wonderful except for the the Mac n cheese.  The Mac n Cheese was very watery.  When a toddler looks at it and starts to wonder what he or she is eating the food isn't prepared correctly.   Atmosphere: outstanding  Adult beverages: outstanding  Food:good Servers: great and fun Cheesecake: awesome  Overall experience: Better than average
Joe S.,"Arrowhead Shadows, Peoria, AZ",15,176,95,2.0,2/28/2016,"I have the same dish everytime we come because it is so good, chicken picatta, and I enjoy a martini with dinner, Bombay Sapphire and Titos. Yes gin AND vodka, I order this everywhere I go and never have had the problems I have here....I have tried on more than 5 different visits and all 5 times I was charges differently.  The first time I came was 9$ fine...the 2nd time was 25$!!!....the 3rd time was 18$, then 16$ and finally 12$...  Each visit I asked for a manager to get my bill straight the 25$ excuse was the put it in as 2 called drinks..  WHAT????  The 18$ was ""input wrong"", and the last time when I was charged 12$ I was told 12$ is the right price because they charge 1$ per Bleu Cheese olive!!!  OMG!!!  I have been ordering this drink for pretty much my entire adult life with 3 bleu cheese olives and have NEVER been charged extra and they aren't even hand stuffed!!!  I have had the bartenders offer to make them for me in places that don't normally have them and they receive a great reward in the terms of their tip...I don't get charged extra!!!  The time when the manager told me the drink was 12 due to the olives I said I was very upset and would not be back, all he said was ""sorry to hear that""  and walked away.... really made us feel wanted!!  The food and service is almost always on point and that's why we love it here but they need to be all on the same page when it comes to the charges!!!  Maybe appreciate the customers a little more as well...we are spending a small fortune for the short time we spend in your establishment!"
Wendy D.,"Phoenix, AZ",32,24,3,5.0,12/12/2016,Came for lunch and had the chicken costeletta ( not sure if I spelled that right). It was amazing! Love the lemon cream sauce!! Expensive (as expected) but very delicious. Also had the vanilla bean cheesecake and was not disappointed. Really good experience just very expensive. Just me and the bill was over $30 but the portion was huge and I ate it for lunch the next day as well.
H. C.,"Glendale, AZ",0,34,,3.0,7/1/2017,"It's been a few years since I last frequented The Cheesecake Factory.  We went on a Tuesday evening around 6:15 and got immediately seated.  Our waiter was excellent.  He brought our drinks quickly followed by bread and butter.  The wife ordered the Thai Coconut-Lime Chicken and I tried the Chicken Madeira. Both dishes were really good!  Dinner was followed with a piece of Key-lime cheese cake.  I'm not sure why we haven't been here in a while, but we certainly plan on returning soon.  FYI, there were a couple dozen people waiting to be seated when we exited after 7:00 PM."
Krystal L.,"Flagstaff, AZ",20,36,68,5.0,6/8/2015,"All around an awesome choice!  I wanted to take my little sister out because she was in town and she wanted the Cheesecake Factory. Our waiter was patient, helpful, and just had great customer service. Hosts were friendly coming and out. Each dish was prepared correctly and was just fantastic! Of course we had to get cheesecake after!  I love the this place, Can't wait to be back! (:"
Anna R.,"Goodyear, AZ",28,217,43,5.0,3/29/2016,"I give The Cheesecake Factory 5 stars.  Yes it is a chain, but by far my favorite chain of all.  Their menu is huge and diverse and did I mention delicious?  Plus it's one of those places that I like to dine at when I'm not really sure what I am in the mood to eat.  We always have a good meal and good service.  It can be a very busy place so we plan our visits accordingly and try to avoid peak times.  This particular location has a great patio.  My kids always get excited when I say 'lets eat at the Cheesecake Factory!' Also, I am on a mission in life to try every kind of cheesecake.  Unfortunately I am only about a third there.  Fortunately that means I get to keep going back. :)"
Bob S.,"Glendale, AZ",2,31,26,1.0,5/24/2017,"So we have come to Cheesecake Factory several times and really enjoyed this place. Great food and service ""usually"". Today on Mothers Day was an exception. The service sucked and my daughter had a fly in her food. Now I understand these things happen and I know that, but what I really had an issue was the lack of concern. They took the plate and said sorry, that they would re-fire a new one right away. Then the waitress comes back and tells us that she put the order in on ""the Fly"" I didn't think that pun was funny at all. She tells us that the manager would come over and that they would take her plate off the bill. 15 minutes went by with no food. I saw the manager walk by us 2 different times and never stopped to talk to us. The lack of concern just pissed me off. My wife loved this place and only ate half her food cold due to losing her appetite. This was supposed to be part of her Mother's Day. Thanks Cheesecake Factory for jacking that up. The manager never came over to apologize. After the family left I asked for the manager. Once he arrived I explained my situation and he said he knew nothing about it. He did apologize and they did take that dish off my bill. Nice work...our waiter never even told him. I told him he lost a customer and he really didn't even seem concerned. Thing is, that area has lots of restaurant choices and lots come and go. With service like this we will take our business elsewhere."
Harmony R.,"Phoenix, AZ",5,16,2,3.0,2/25/2016,"I came here with my family for my aunt's birthday dinner. This was the first time my grandma has come down to visit from Cali, in months so we were all pretty excited. The staff was very friendly that day (we came on Saturday evening). Our server was nice and seemed very friendly and attentive.  It appears my Grandma had stopped by this location before coming to our house so that she could put in the order for my aunt's favorite cheesecake. Apparently when we got the restaurant , she forgot the receipt back at our place. Fortunately, the guy who was our server was able to locate our order.  The reason for the 3 stars is the slow service. They didn't appear very busy, yet it took over 20 minutes for my aunt to get her drink even though we all had our drinks and food already. We told three different employees about the drink and still had to wait and wait. Overall, good service (just slow) and good food."
