Lauren K.,"Philadelphia, PA",172,5,,3.0,7/31/2017,"Great restaurant, but bad experience at this location:  Overall, typically: great food, especially drinks and cheesecake, at relatively more expensive prices. Nice atmosphere.  Bad experience tonight: Went here for half off cheesecakes. Sat at a table by the bar around 8:30pm and ordered our three slices of cheesecake. After about ten minutes, the waiter came to us and told us they were backed up in the bakery so it would be longer. We waited a total of ~40minutes until our cheesecakes arrived, and this was after having our nice waiter check in on them twice. A quick bite for cheesecake turned into an hour and a half meal... Do not recommend coming in for half off cheesecakes, unless you are willing to really wait."
Kiki L.,"Los Angeles, CA",430,175,214,1.0,12/21/2017,"This place is a waste for its prime location. No prices on cocktail or draft beers, cheesecake menu.. ok so should we all be pretentious and pay for things we don't know the prices of?  Therefore I asked how much the PASSIONFRUIT mojito is, she said ""I believe it's around $11""...  im sorry... I believe? That could mean a lot of things. I don't want to order a drink and get a check of a cocktail for $14. If I wanted that I could go to Rumor.  After I asked for the cocktail price.. the waitress gave me a disdained look and never came back! Didn't even look at my friend and I again. Ok so I guess she assumed that we were poor cuz we asked the price of a mojito. After literally 15  minutes of no service, no water (cricket).. we LEFT. So I don't do this a lot, reviewing without trying the food. But here it is! My first and last Cheesecake Factory visit."
Belle S.,"Philadelphia, PA",3,34,8,1.0,11/30/2017,"Came here with my boyfriend last night as we were deciding between iHOP and the CF since we were both really hungry and just wanted filling food.  The first thing I noticed was that when our waiter brought over our water there were lemon slices floating in it. I'm not a health freak but I always prefer my lemon wedges on the side of the glass because who knows if they even washed them? Anyway it was just a passing thought and I didn't think anything of it.  I ordered the pasta carbonara and immediately I knew there was something wrong. The sauce tasted so bland, except where the waitress grated Parmesan cheese over. I added salt and pepper and there was barely any difference. Regardless, I finished about half of it before my boyfriend and I decided to take the rest of our food to go.  I got home and I felt really sick all of a sudden. I went to bed early and when I got up for work the next morning I had an upset stomach. I called out from work and thank God that I did because a half hour later I threw up all the fluids I drank that morning. I threw up two more times afterwards and had an upset stomach two more times later in the day.  I didn't associate this with anything until I called my boyfriend at work and he said it sounded like I had food poisoning. I read up on the symptoms of it and he was right. I was shaking, feeling feverish, and my hands and feet were tingling. I had lost so much fluids that every time I stood up I started seeing black and white and had to hold onto something.  My boyfriend has been in the industry for more than 20 years, owned restaurants, been a partner, and been a general manager. He said that when sauces are left out too long, they lose their taste, and that was probably why I got so sick. He said he noticed me seasoning my dish with salt and was surprised as places like the Cheesecake Factory have dishes with high calorie counts and are already so flavorful to the point of being unhealthy.  I called the restaurant and told Anthony the GM what I had experienced and he offered to give me a gift card. I said no thank you and would prefer a partial refund for at least my portion of the meal. He said that it was not possible. I even offered to bring in the food we had taken home for him to inspect but he said it was not necessary.  Due to his lack of assistance, I called the guest services line in California and they were much more kind even though they still refused to offer a refund, though they did offer to look into the issue. They offered a gift card as well and I was thinking to myself, ""are these people serious? They think I want to get food poisoning again for free this time."" I said even if they can't offer me a refund I don't need a gift card as I would never return.  Clearly TCF Is only interested in money and not winning their customers back or making sure their health inspection standards are on par. Thanks for nothing!!!!"
Sara K.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,12,2,1.0,10/23/2017,"As someone who is part of the industry and has been to Cheesecake multiple times, my friends and I were especially disappointed. The food was fine, you always know what to expect.  The service: To our server James, I guess he was having an especially bad day (we know bc he complained to us and our surrounding tables multiple times how he's been here all day). His banter with other tables as well as ours was EXTREMELY uncomfortable and inappropriate!!! Things were said that should NEVER be said as a server or by anyone in the service industry.  We waited an absurd amount for literally every part of our meal. We didn't get water or greeted for a good 10 minutes, in an empty restaurant. After we paid the check (which when we corrected him he told us to just give him $** amount bc I guess he didn't feel like changing it in the computer) and tipped him we waited around for our to go cheesecakes patiently even after everything, he finally came up to our table and said ""you can stay as long as you like I'm just gonna get this out of your way"" and took my friends tipped check and the menus, but ignored the empty dishes in front of us. Then we told him we're sitting here waiting for our cheesecakes, which he so obviously forgot. Even after very clearly letting him know how to separate them for the 3 of us he brought it over in one bag... I am extremely forgiving of service where ever I go, and never leave this long of a review, unless it is this bad and a place where I expect a higher standard."
Yao H.,"Seattle, WA",1,123,497,5.0,12/28/2017,"This restaurant is quite famous for its cheese cake and we had finally got the chance to try it out. Had the original one and red velvet one, respectively. The red velvet one looked much larger than the original one. Both of these two cheese cakes tasted yummy! Perfect dessert!"
Kareem S.,"University City, Philadelphia, PA",14,5,3,4.0,1/6/2018,"Great Location it's spacious, and offers a nice view of Center City Philly, depending on where you are seated. The atmosphere is pretty nice as well, and so is the staff. Also the menu is pretty solid, I love their salmon, brown rice, and broccoli, and Cheesecake for desert is very rich and tasty. I normally go for happy hour because I never experience a long wait during those hours."
Linda T.,"Queens, NY",128,256,923,4.0,7/7/2017,"This was my 1st time EVER trying the Cheesecake Factory in general. The one in Queens, New York is always packed and has a long wait. My friends told me that the one in Long Island, New York was the same thing. We found this place randomly while walking around looking for a place to eat for dinner. The place here is HUGE and we were seated right away. I'm not sure if people were away for the long July 4th weekend, but I was surprised that the place wasn't crowded. Many of the entree options are 1,500+ calories! I'm not surprised because I have heard on the news before that entrees at Cheesecake Factory have high calorie count. We ordered our entrees from the SkinnyLicious Menu. I opted for the Lemon-Garlic Shrimp and it comes with Angel Hair pasta. It was delicious and the shrimp tasted pretty fresh. The food portions were just right and I wasn't overly stuffed. Our waitress was very friendly and attentive. She was happy to fulfill our requests. Our utensils and my napkin cloth were slightly dirty in the beginning and she got replacements for us. She checked up on us often to see if we needed anything else too. We didn't eat cheesecake here since we were full. Maybe next time we'll leave some room for dessert."
Morris B.,"Philadelphia, PA",638,65,150,4.0,5/9/2017,"As ya'll know, I had a bad chicken casear salad from here last week, which I have to say in retrospect was an isolated incident because I went yesterday for Happy Hour and the food and drinks were AMAZING as usual! I normally only get cheesecake while i;m here but the adventurous side of me said ""bruh, lets get some carrotcake"".  And lemme tell ya...the Carrotcake was arguably the best I've had. I've had some good carrotcake in my short life, but the cheescake factory carrot cake was HUGE and very moist! Well worth the $8 value!  The Nachos are really...really..really good, too. It's usually all I can handle unless i'm sharing some with my greedy friends, i mean hungry friends. I'm actually going to attempt to try the chicken casear salad again because I'm confident it was a one-time thang.  Thangs happen, yanno??"
Cindy M.,"Lansdowne, PA",274,562,3259,2.0,7/13/2017,This visit was a bust which makes me sad as we visited with out of town guests. We ordered apps which were good (nachos and artichoke and crab dip).  Hubby had a kale salad We barely started and our food came out.  Hubby was only able to finish half his salad which he held above the table since there were too many large plates (there were 5 of us). I ordered the combination ($22 approx) which had my favorite chicken merdiera with a salmon.  The chicken was so small that it was disappointing.  The salmon was drowned in a green chopped parsley (type) that I could not even tell it was salmon.  See my pic One plate didn't come out for about 10 min later so we all waited and ate our food cold.  I mean if you're going To bring the food out early bring it out together. Everyone's else said the food was good  Waitress was eh. I think I was more disappointed that she didn't say anything when my husband was eating in the air w his bowl  The others had dessert but I was so turned off by my meal that I didn't bother.  $200 later and I was disappointed  Wish I spent a bit more and went to Delfriscos.  Yes I'll try again but I know to avoid the combo and wait to order my meal    I guess w most chains u get a hit or miss you waitress and you have to know the tips when ordering I should add the last few times we visited everything is great... this visit was just so disappointing.
Michael G.,"Philadelphia, PA",42,18,53,4.0,12/6/2017,"Overall I love the Cheesecake Factory and it many locations but this one is pretty amazing. You get to go up these escalators just to get to the restaurant which is pretty fancy, not to mention the awesome views of the city. Food and service excellent."
Sherry X.,"Philadelphia, PA",7,79,99,3.0,5/26/2017,"FYI: Their portion sizes are HUGE and the calorie count definitely matches what you get so you might be eating a full days worth of calories in a single meal.  The fiancé and I were in center city on a date night sorta type thing and came here before checking out some DIY wedding supplies at the AC Moore nearby. Let's just say....it's been a while. WHAT I GOT: Grilled fish tacos PROS: First of all, I gotta give it up to our waiter. He was legit the sweetest person ever with the way he talked to us and served us during the meal that it made up for the lack of flavor in our food. And I also appreciate the fact that the Cheesecake Factory lists the calorie count of their food. I mean, for how big their portions are, you can kinda guess how much you're taking in but it's also good to have a set number. The food was cooked pretty well: nice moist chicken and flaky fish. All the ingredients tasted fresh and there were some good flavor combinations in my taco. The ambiance of this place is also pretty cozy and definitely family friendly. CONS: Where to start...well for starters, my taco shells were uhhh...limp and cold. And the fish on the inside joined them within minutes of hitting the table. The cilantro rice they serve with it tasted ok but that's about it. Just ok. They also gave me a little bowl of beans but I took two bites and left it alone. My fiancé's truffle honey chicken was incredibly bland though. The skin didn't taste like much, neither did the meat on the inside. Most of the flavor came from the sauce on the plate. His mashed potatoes were peppery af but with the chicken, it wasn't terrible. I'm not sure if the quality of the food decreased since the last time I had it but it definitely wasn't really something I'd be like ""dying to try""."
Tariq P.,"Philadelphia, PA",6,20,4,1.0,12/27/2017,Is hair the new topping for your Calamari? Cheesecake Factory Philly this is disgusting
Daniel M.,"Philadelphia, PA",43,97,269,1.0,2/3/2017,I came in here just to pick up cheesecake. The young lady at the counter was rude and never even made eye contact with me. It felt as if she didn't want to be there. If she's not happy with her job she should find another one. I went in on 02/03/17 around 10:00pm. I hope management reads this and fires her. The gentlemen who made the cake was nicer and was doing his job to the best of his ability. I'm spending $8.75 on a slice of cheesecake I would think I would get a thank you and have a good evening. The inside is nice and I'm sure other employees their are nice. The dessert area looked messy and the girl behind the counter just wasn't professional at all. I won't be returning to this location. The location in cherry hill is a lot nicer and also a free parking lot and a lot nicer group of employees.
Morgan R.,"Philadelphia, PA",46,12,7,5.0,12/5/2017,"Great lunch out! I had the fried zucchini appetizer and the carbonara with added chicken. They do lunches until 5pm and happy hour from 4pm. Sat at the bar, service was great, very friendly."
Shrea S.,"Denver, CO",14,93,86,1.0,3/4/2017,"Just paid $17 for a nothing entree! This is ridiculous! Got the shrimp pasta and there is maybe 1/8 a cup of pasta. This is ridiculous. I called to complain and the lady just put me on hold.  Update - management contacted me back, so hopefully they do something about this."
Francis R.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,13,,3.0,1/5/2018,"The interior of this restaurant/bar is exquisite. However, on my recent dinner visit, I received a menu and then my waitress got lost for over ten minutes. It was not pleasant. I was at a booth facing the bar and to my left were many people waiting to be called. I felt like they were breathing down my neck. I hope to return again and get better service. MY experience at the same restaurant at the King of Prussia Mall has been incredibly good, however."
Shing L.,"Philadelphia, PA",1,5,15,3.0,11/14/2017,Love the cheesecake which is really amazing and the interior of the restaurant looks so fancy. The only thing that I complained about just the service. The food came out way too long which took about 40 minutes. Overall is okay.
Jasmine A.,"Vancouver, Canada",162,276,823,2.0,11/23/2016,"Starving, we stopped at the Cheescake Factory for lunch.  The Cheescake Factory isn't anything special--typical North American kind of dishes, such as pastas, burgers, etc, the type of food that hits the spot when you're hungry. There were plenty of tasty options, but looking through the menu, I was horrified.  I knew the Cheesecake Factory isn't the best place to go if you're health conscious, but my god, the calorie content was absolutely horrific; most of their dishes were between 1500 to 2000 calories each, an entire day's worth of calories.  Ugh.  Thank goodness they had a ""skinny"" menu which offered lower calorie dishes, around 600 calories each. Off the skinny menu, I ordered the enchiladas (I just couldn't order from the regular menu, knowing that I would be consuming 1800 calories in one sitting).  I still don't quite believe that they were ""only"" 590 calories, as they were a full portion and extremely filling. Overall I am rating The Cheescake Factory only two stars because the food is just average, the calorie content horrifying, and the waiter was a bit condescending."
Abraham K.,"Philadelphia, PA",557,353,13,2.0,5/29/2017,"This Cheesecake Factory is two stories. Unexpected 30 minute wait on a Sunday night for a table for four. Please turn the dimmer up so there's some lighting. I like ambiance but there's a problem when you can barely see the food in front of you. Table and silverware was unkempt. For some reason, there were still cloth napkins from the previous party before us on the ground. Server was solid. Seemed like they were understaffed this night because he did not appear until we were 10 minutes into looking at the menu. Hostess did not set up smaller plates to share.  Food portions were huge and everything came out hot and delicious. 6 beers on tap and over 280 menu items."
Rhonda W.,"Lansdowne, PA",2,34,,5.0,11/7/2017,"First time at this location and I was impressed! The service was excellent (our server's name was Steven). He was very attentive. We had a party of 4, celebrating a birthday. I ordered jambalaya which was great and plentiful. The other ladies had sandwiches which they enjoyed. Crab balls and calamari for apps, sweet potato cheesecake to go. Will definitely return!"
Austin L.,"Philadelphia, PA",138,55,123,5.0,6/25/2017,"Came here with 4 other people and we were seated within a few minutes. We were given a menu and then asked about drinks, I got the Peach Smoothie and my friends got water with lemon(the waiter was really chill about it; some waiters might get irritated with extra work of lemon).  We started with appetizers which was nachos, cheese covered with something(sorry forgot) and BBQ chicken.  The nachos was BIG that 4 of us could not even finish. ONLY get the nachos if you're super hungry and have a big group of people. The cheese cover was very rich and cheesy. The BBQ chicken was cooked just right and my friend finished that all! The meals came and I got the lunch special of sausage and shrimp pasta. The sausage and shrimp was AMAZING and pasta sauce tasted so fresh!! The peach drink tasted organic and very fresh but I still prefer their Mango Iced Tea but I'm trying to taste all their drinks. My friend got a burger and he asked for cheese on it, in which was not given to us at first but the waiter remembered as she brought it over and went back into the kitchen which shows she has great instinct and memorization, I guess... but the waiter was really good with coming to us regularly and not too much, refilling our bread, and even enjoying some laughs with us."
Tea J.,"Olney-Oak Lane, Philadelphia, PA",0,3,4,4.0,10/12/2017,This was my first time here it was four of us I liked that it was not very crowded but it was very dark could not read the menu without my phone flashlight my server was all over the place we got water after our beverages and we waited a whole for him to come back n take my son's order since they say we serve breakfast all day but they don't only certain things but the food was good I thought for the price I did not get enough shrimp n I think for the amount of people there our server was just not available when we needed him I will return saw something on the lunch menu I would like to try but drinks are beyond pricey 14.00 for a margarita that was not good
Jonathan G.,"Wynnewood, PA",119,67,39,4.0,5/12/2017,First time eating at this particular Cheesecake Factory. I would say it's consistent with my expectations for Cheesecake Factory restaurants in general. The server was very nice and responsive. The food was also good. We had a couple of apps: chicken tacquitos and the buffalo chicken nuggets. Both were good but if I had to pick I'd go with the tacquitos.  For my main course I had the Thai chicken with mango. As always with CKF the portion was big and I am now busting at the seams. I thought the chicken and the sauce were good.  Surprisingly enough I did not have any Cheesecake! But I have had it before and they are all delicious.
Allie G.,"Canton, CT",122,69,46,5.0,11/6/2017,"I always have a good meal at any Cheesecake Factory but we were on vacation in philly and decided to stop, this was one of the best experiences we've had at a restaurant. I wish I could remember our waitresses name but she was amazing and super nice. If we were ever in the area again we would definitely come back."
April J.,"Clementon, NJ",9,45,50,4.0,8/14/2017,"Visited this location for the first time during my lunch hour and I was surprised that it was not crowded!  Food was delicious and the service was fast. I purchased a slice of cheesecake to go. Considering the small size of the slice, I think that the cheesecake is overpriced, but it is so darn yummy that I did mind spending almost $9 on the 1590 calorie desert :)"
Skyla C.,"Philadelphia, PA",64,156,1565,2.0,12/26/2016,Cheesecake factory has been around for the longest but we decided to dine in tonight because the waiting line at max brenner was just too crazy . I first had cheesecake factory when it was opened years ago back at home in Boston. I never really liked the food there . 5 stars goes towards their cheesecakes though. So we decided to give cheesecake factory a second chance.  When we first walked in hostess greeted us but gave us a weird look instead of a smile . Points off there . And then told us there's about 15 to 20 mins wait and we said okay that's fine. She didn't lock us in the computer at first until another  group came in after us and see us just standing there. We then was given a number beeper and told we could go right ahead upstairs . Surprising the wait wasn't long . So that was good . Took us a bit to look over the menu because there was a variety to choose from. So our waitress came and took our orders for drinks and apps . We decided to get buffalo Blast and dynamite shrimp for appetizers (as pictured) . The Buffalo blast was good . The dynamite shrimp was okay. It could use a little more flavor . For entrée I decided to go with the chicken marsala and my boyfriend got the meatloaf. When the drink came she only brought my boyfriend drink and told me my drink will be out shortly. I thoughts all the drinks supposed to come out at the same time and not just one and while the other wait for theirs . But okay. The first appetizer came out which was the Buffalo blast half way eating it my drink still hasn't come yet and I was thirsty after a few bites . My drink didn't come out until my entrée came out which was probably 20 mins after . Sign of bad service because the couple next to us ordered drinks and all their drinks came out right away by a different waitress . After a few bites of our food we was ready to leave because my boyfriend didn't like how his food taste and my chicken marsala was sweet and the sauce tasted burnt while I was eating it . I didn't want to make a big deal out of it so we just asked the waitress to packed the food to go . I should of just stick to my instance and went elsewhere because the food hasn't meet our expectations . I won't return to dine in but definitely for the cheesecakes.
Renea R.,"Philadelphia, PA",4,218,2,4.0,6/19/2017,"My friend, Naomi (also known as BB or Birthday Bitch), invited a group of around 10 friends to the Cheesecake Factory for a celebration of her being born.  I had been to the King of Prussia CF but never to the downtown location.  The CF is always a bit of an odyssey into another world, where people have expendable cash and suburban hairstyles and where decadence is supremely exalted, in both garish displays of décor and overall gluttony.  In this way, the Cheesecake Factory is a quite viscerally American experience. While waiting at the bar I chatted with my buddy, Hawkeye, and spent $10 on a bottled Angry Orchard.  Cocktails were in the double digit range, and seeing how I was a poor social worker masquerading as a person who can afford to eat at fancy restaurants, I opted to not get any more alcoholic drinks throughout my stay. Eventually we were moved to a large table that could accommodate our group.  Our server was polite and attentive and tolerant of our low class requests, such as bringing me hot sauce to pair with the free bread they serve.  Speaking of the free bread, it was delicious and regrettably I ate quite a lot of it despite having given up gluten recently. Communing with the other indigent social workers, Hawkeye and I decided to split some nachos with our friend Brenda.  The calorie content was well over your overall daily allowance so it seemed that splitting it three ways would be wise.  Getting swept up in the gluttony of this establishment, I impulsively decided to also order their ""Nashville Hot"" chicken nuggets which were only $5.  They claimed to be quite hot, which I considered dubious but figured it was worth a try. When the nachos arrived, they were as enormous as we had hoped and had generous portions of good toppings including spicy chicken, cheese, sour cream, guacamole, and salsa.  I wouldn't say that there was anything particularly ""special"" about these nachos, but they were large, filling, and tasty so I was very happy with this decision.  They were also more than enough for three people and frankly I did not need my impulsive chicken nuggets.  Speaking of the chicken nuggets, I found them very underwhelming.  Only one chicken nugget out of ten was sufficiently saucy and the overall heat level was practically imperceptible. BB's new man friend, Landon (who worked hard all night to prove to us that he wasn't a Blandon) got the fried mac and cheese balls and generously shared with the table in what I can only imagine was a ploy to win good favor in the group.  These were cheese-filled pillows of heaven and you could only hope to be so lucky as to get to experience them for free at some point in your lifetime.  He also got a very mysterious dish which was a pizza made with chicken-parmesan crust and pasta on top.  I didn't get to taste it but I can only imagine that it was quite indulgent. At the conclusion of the meal, a handful of the brave ordered cheesecake.  Thanks to the plentiful free bread I was bloated up like a hot air balloon and had no money or appetite left for dessert but I admired those that were able to go ""all the way.""  I have had CF Cheesecake before and it's incredibly delicious, probably as a result of each slice including over three quarters of your daily calorie content. In the end, what could be more wholesomely American than group of ten 20-something-year-olds (okay fine, I'm 30...) caucusing in the soft glow of ornate chandeliers of ostentation, eating a week's worth of calories in food they will have to buy on credit to afford, surrounded by suburban families ignoring everything but their iphones.  BB seemed happy to usher in a new year of life in this manner and frankly I enjoyed myself and the food very much."
Jackson C.,"Los Angeles, CA",10,35,6,3.0,10/28/2017,"This place is the good, the bad, and the ugly. The good of course was the cheesecake, I had some kind of caramel pecan cheesecake that was 5 stars for sure. The food was bad, my salad was wilted and extra chewy, my shrimp was medium well and I believe that shrimp and seafood should be thoroughly cooked. The ugly was our waiter, I forgot his name but he was awful each course came to the table at least 20 minutes apart, I even had to look for him to get silverware to eat our salads with because there was none on the table when we sat down and he did not bringing any out with our food. We requested them and after 20 minutes of waiting I had to go and find him, geez."
Casey P.,"Philadelphia, PA",39,147,22,3.0,8/1/2017,"Pretty basic. I liked our appetizers: Chicken samosas and shrimp rolls (Vietnamese style). You know, Cheesecake Factory has their standard items. My rating is pretty much for the service here. It was just slow. It appeared our waiter was stretched too thin, there were some times he was overattentive, but for a large portion of the meal (we were there for lunch), he was MIA. There were swaths of time where all of our dishes were on the table without being taken away for room, where we wanted more water, where we waited to order the food, waited for the check. It just was inconsistently timed the whole lunch. It's a nice location, but I have yet to be wowed at this Cheesecake Factory's service."
Michelle R.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,3,,3.0,10/31/2017,"Went for lunch. I got the chicken carbonara lunch size, which was delicious. The waitress was very prompt and nice. The hosts were also great. Only complaint is that I got a cheesecake to go. I waited for my uber and went home (about 25-30 minutes). I go to eat my cheesecake and it was still rock solid frozen. :("
Bhavika P.,"Philadelphia, PA",75,185,572,3.0,1/26/2017,Had a no calorie count kinda day today and I enjoyed it by having the delicious cheesecakes (while chocolate raspberry truffle being my fav of all).  Starters: Avocado egg rolls was yum specially the dip that comes with it just makes it perfect. I loved it. Nachos was alright.  Main course: bang bang chicken and shrimp. Was too sweet for me. I am not sure if it always supposed to take like that but I did not enjoy it at all due to the sweetness.  Dessert: Plain cheesecake and raspberry truffle.  Great place to go when you are a big group and everyone has a different cuisine in mind as this place serves almost everything right from eggs to desserts!! Low calorie and full of calorie!!  I took off 2 stars only because the service seemed slow even on a empty afternoon lunch hour. We were a big group (16) no doubt but I think we needed 2 people to take care than just 1. The server was really good no complains but taking care of so many people was too time consuming and there was a long break between the appetizers and main course.  The quantity of food is huge. Definitely value for money!!
Angela L.,"Merion Station, PA",273,66,236,2.0,6/18/2017,"I rarely ever complain about a restaurants service and kitchen staff; however, the dining experience at this specific Cheesecake Factory was absolutely awful. For starters, the waiter listened to our orders, didn't write them down and then proceeded to come back to the table and ask us for our orders again. The three of us dining all made modifications to our orders. When he brought out orders over, he did not take note of the modifications, resulting in us having to wait even longer for our food. Once our ""correct"" food came over, there was still food missing and the quality was not good. My mom ordered the grilled chicken tostado salad. The tostado was limp and soaked instead of crispy, and there was no chicken on the salad. I ordered the Tuscan chicken subbed with salmon which comes with artichokes but there were no artichokes, and the salmon portion was so small. I had gone to the King of Prussia location the night before which had a salmon filet double the size served at the Philadelphia location. The manager was nice enough to give me another portion of salmon but the overall quality of service and food was sub-par at best. Will not be coming to this location again."
Donna Mae F.,"Philadelphia, PA",37,6,1,3.0,7/23/2017,"I am a sweet-tooth, so I like desserts. And cheesecake factory offers a great deal of it. My first time was a definite ""Yehey!"". I like the setting and I remember I enjoyed my food, serving was huge, i like their complimentary wheat bread, plus I have Godiva cheesecake too. I would recommend this place for first time visitors in Philadelphia or in the US. Try it! However, I feel i got used to it and later on I feel that there's really nothing 'wow' on the menu if ever you will have lunch or dinner there, save for the cakes of course."
Christina L.,"Philadelphia, PA",236,7,15,4.0,7/31/2017,"Take the escalators up to the lively and spacious Cheesecake Factory located in the heart of Center City Philadelphia.  This place is known for their inviting ambiance, and more importantly,  the extensive variety of delicious cheesecakes they provide. Food: 3.5/5 - The cheesecakes are without a doubt their signature desserts.  Rich, sweet, and absolutely fulfilling, these pieces (running from 6-8 dollars a piece) will have you wondering what flavor you should get on your next visit.  Their main dishes are not as impressionable and tend to be over-seasoned.  Many of their dishes consist of pasta, sandwiches, and other familiar American favorites (roasted chicken, tacos, etc).  The cheesecake alone gets a 4.5/5 rating in my book; however, the other options do not measure up. Service: 3/5 - The waiters and waitresses are friendly but tend to get lost during peak dining hours.  No matter what request you have, they are extremely happy and willing to fulfill your request.... it may just take some time to get your check or that extra straw you needed five minutes ago. Ambiance: 3.5/5 - Like any other Cheesecake Factory, this location is spacious and has a high-ceiling providing a nice break from the usual Philadelphian restaurant scene.  The warm colored interior invites birthday parties to the casual diners.   Value: 4/5 - For a restaurant chain, the prices tend to be on the higher end.  However, these prices are justified by their huge portions.  They are much greater than your typical restaurants (especially in for being in the city).  More often then not, you will be coming out quite full and taking home the leftovers. OVERALL RATING: 3.5/5 Personal Recommendation: For the best Cheesecake Factory experience, I recommend coming here just for the cheesecakes.  Expecting or looking for more will probably leave you a bit unsatisfied."
Tisha G.,"Philadelphia, PA",33,20,1,2.0,10/28/2017,My third or fourth time here. Haven't loved a meal yet. The food is just ok to me. I'm always let down. The lighting is kept so low that it's difficult to read the menus. The A/C is always too cold for my liking. No more cheesecake factory for me.
Josh M.,"Noblesville, IN",125,6,,1.0,5/23/2017,"Walk in and notice it's a 2 story restaurant and I stand at the hostess stand for 3 min. After waiting I decide to walk up stairs to try and find someone, to no avail. So, I walk back down stairs and wait another 5 min with 2 other parties. Eventually I decide to call the place and with no apology they say come up stairs. I'm greater by a manager being told someone made a mess of the bathroom so the hostess had to clean it up. There is so much wrong with this situation!  After being sat I waited and waited for service ... By far my worst experience at a Cheesecake Factory. On a good note once I received service he was very professional and had great service."
Connie J.,"Philadelphia, PA",23,2,,1.0,10/27/2017,"I often frequent the Center City location on Walnut St. My girls and I usually hang out after a long week at work. Well wouln't you know it the time my I bring my children with me our experience is the worst. I CAN'T stand an establishment that changes up week to week. Well DON'T need to go on. Definitely, won't be coming back."
Kathleen D.,"Richmond, VA",797,1716,11828,3.0,3/7/2016,"Take-out only review. One of my friends was in from out of town and was craving cheesecake. We walked a couple blocks over, took the elevator upstairs and were greeted by a hangry mob. Well, basically. It was midday on a Saturday and this place was bursting at the seams with people waiting for tables. Originally we planned to eat-in until we heard about the crazy wait time. No thanks. Fortunately, they do have a to-go counter. While the process of ordering was a bit unorganized and the staff unfriendly, we were able to snag our cheesecake slices and leave within about 10 minutes. I ordered the chocolate chip cookie dough, and it was pretty darn good. I don't want to consider the calorie count on that thing...but if you're in the mood for an extra sweet snack, you could very well visit this accessible spot. Of course, there's also the option of stopping in one of the local haunts, where you're likely to find stellar fare at better prices. But that's just the anti-chain snob in me speaking!"
Jennifer M.,"Philadelphia, PA",557,25,1,1.0,10/7/2017,"This location is the WORST!!!! The food is terrible. I love cheesecake factory and visit many of their other locations. I have been to this location about 5 times (gave them many chances YES) but they never seem to impress me. Every meal is just ok. The mashed potatoes were so dry I could not even swallow them, Cheeseburger so salty I could not even eat it. I can go on and on. Dont visit this location"
Sam A.,"Philadelphia, PA",85,197,1453,5.0,1/24/2016,"I get great solid food everything I'm here. It's not a diner and not fine dining but right smack in the middle. The servings are enough for a ravenous appetite plus lunch for the next day. Service is a lil slow, but it's a Packed place always, and theropod comes out so perfect.  My go to dish is bang bang chicken but today I chose chicken and fries (pic posted)  From the servers to the hostess to the managers, everyone is so friendly.  The cheesecake selection is EXTENSIVE but don't leave without getting one to go- I get the caramel pecan. Nathan is the best server!!"
