Justin B.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,3,,2.0,12/10/2015,"I'm not a huge fan of chains like this, but I've had meals at other locations where the food is good. Overly processed, enormous portions, yes. But that's what the place is about. You know that going in. The food here was not good. Even in that generic, Cheesecake factory way. Overly salty steak tasting like it was just drowned in soy sauce. Some eggroll dish I shared with the friend I went with also was not good. Drinks were not good. Waitress was sweet. Silverware was dirty. Fairly empty considering. I think they've got some kinks to work out if they want to deliver up that chain experience other locations produce."
Paula W.,"Philadelphia, PA",9,7,,1.0,10/2/2015,worst service. went there with a coworker for lunch today. ordered a cup of green tea they brought out a mint tea bag. ordered full size specialty pizza & crab bites appetizer. after waiting 45 minutes they brought us a personal size pizza for one. Had no time to wait for the order to be corrected. i had stop at Wendy's for a burger & head back to work. $14 for 2 cups of tea & an appetizer that wasnt anything to rave about.
Anne F.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,4,,1.0,4/4/2016,"Okay if i was just reviewing the food it would have five stars. the food is never to disappoint. However the service at this location sucks. i have religiously gone to the king of prussia location and the food and service and well overall atmosphere are out of this world. I will never go back to this location again to dine only get take out. hopefully there take out doesn't suck. so me an my fiance are finally seated and immediately off on the wrong foot. the table next to us is clearly aggravated. they have the same waitress we are about to get and they have been waiting an hour for food, when their food arrives it isn't there food. the waitress argues with them that that is what they ordered. in what universe is the customer wrong. oh and to clarify the waitress is AMANDA G, REMEMBER IF YOU WISH TO GO THERE ASK NOT TO GET AMANDA G. here is more to explain why if that wasn't clear enough. When we finally get her we ask for two waters to drink. when she returns she throws them on the table and immediately dives in to arguing once again with the table next to us. their experience was bad enough, ours was about to get worse. Oh and the manager who ever he was on shift Saturday night was no help to them. if he was she would have been fired. I repeat FIRE AMANDA G FIRE AMANDA G. she delivers our food by giving my fiance his order, he was done eating by the time mine came. Oh and those two waters that were half spilled on the table by AMANDA G.  never got refilled. she never even asked and she wasn't around long enough for us to ask. later she comes to clear the dishes. she takes my fiances empty dish and starts to clear mine while there is food on them and i am still eating. she didn't even ask if i was done or wanted a box. i sharply looked at her and demanded to go boxes for my food. i was fed up and wanted to go. she comes back drops off the boxes and is gone. doesn't ask us if we want dessert or even give us the menu. my fiance convinces me to stay we should at least enjoy dessert. i had to basically yell at her to get a menu. she drops it off and vanishes. i had to get her attention again to order. she drops off two cheesecakes and doesn't give us forks. when she does she sure is quick to give us our check funny thing about that. we put in a credit card to pay. she never came back to us to get it. we kept trying to get her attention. nothing. she would be at the table next to us flirting with these two older guys and didn't even hear us. i was really fed up took the bill and our credit card and had another waiter help us. She only got a three dollar tip from us. that was only in case she has to split tips with the buss boys.oh and once again AMANDA G is an AWFUL WORKER DON'T LET HER SERVE YOU."
Carlos C.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,6,,2.0,8/18/2015,"I came here with a friend for lunch. The service was slow. The food was ok (tasted slightly better than what it looked). My plate arrived in 30 minutes. It took an extra 15 minutes for my friends food to arrive. Essentially it took 45 minutes before we were both eating. I ordered the herb crusted chicken. It looked like it was just sitting in grease. The crust was mushy. Tasted a little of it and it tasted ok. But it was not a good experience. I was given a free cheesecake for the inconvenience, which was fine. I had to ask for the check no sooner that all of the food arrived."
Ella B.,"Staten Island, NY",0,2,1,1.0,8/13/2015,"We went there for lunch today and left in 45 min without ever getting any food.  Drinks came fast and they were good, but food was all other story. My salmon never came because I was told it was over cooked.  My husband's beef medallions came well done instead of medium rare.  They brought his food down without bringing anything to me.   My husband sent his meat back and when a manager came to apologize we decided to leave. Philly is the city full of great restaurants and we will never be foolish enough to go back to The Cheesecake Factory.."
Pam C.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,15,1,2.0,7/20/2015,"I have been to CCF in King of Prussia and now to the new Center City location.  Besides the impressive space and decor, I honestly can't see what people get so excited about.  The cheesecake is just ""OK.""  I ordered the classic with fresh strawberries.  I really didn't see much difference between it and any frozen brand you can get from the grocery store."
Kendra S.,"Eatontown, NJ",0,4,,1.0,10/17/2015,"This was one of the worst restaurant experiences I have ever dealt with. From beginning to end the service could not have been any worse. When we walked into the door the hostess did not seem to want to be bothered with any of the customers. I had asked for a table to seat 13 people and was told the wait would be about an hour. After about 35 minutes of waiting, my party and I noticed that the hostess had walked out of the restaurant. A customer had asked us if we were waiting to be seated and we replied ""yes,"" he then informed us that the restaurant had been struggling that night and that he waited over 30 minutes for a to go order. We were then seated after about an hour and a half wait, but when we arrived at our table there were only 11 seats and even those were crammed together. We asked management if we could have another table added to the two that were already pushed together and the staff made it seem as though it was too difficult of a task to be done, so we began to move the tables ourselves until finally one of the employees saw and politely moved them for us. The hostess we had, who never mentioned her name throughout the entire meal, had the worst customer service I have ever seen. She asked if we would like drinks but only took drink orders for 5 of the guests. When asked about one of the drinks on the menu, the waitress seemed clueless. After we finished our appetizers, our meals began to come out, but our waitress did not take any of our finished dishes from the table in order to make room. After our meals, our waitress did not even ask if we would like to have any left overs wrapped to go or if we would like dessert, even after two guests ordered cheesecake. Throughout the entire dinner, my party, as well as myself, did not have a good time and we all agreed that we will not be attending this location ever again."
T S.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,1,,1.0,1/15/2016,"The décor in the restaurant was great but the service and the food were horrible.  I tried this location twice and each time has been worst. I tried to attribute the first visit to the location just opening and the staff was new but the second time was worst.  My husband order an appetizer, the wings and they were dry and overcooked.  We ordered our entrees, Miso Salmon and I ordered a burger.  The Miso salmon was dry and didn't have all the ingredients such as the miso that he was used to, when he tried to explain this to the waitress she had no idea what the dish should look like and never brought over the manager.  My burger which I thought was a safe selection was either left over from the day before and was served on the dinner rolls that they serve when you arrive.  We have always visited the Cheesecake Factory in the King of Prussia mall and never experience this service or horrible food.  If in center city stick to the local restaurants or bars but don't try this place.  I'm just glad we didn't get food poisoning. :-("
Rob L.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,3,,2.0,8/6/2015,"i love cheesecake factory--food's not gourmet but the ambiance is fun so it makes up for it. i've been to at least 10 different locations in various states and this one is by far the worst of them all. nothing ruins an experience more than poor service. horrible service.  we were seated pretty quickly on a Saturday afternoon, but no one came to our table for the next 10-15 minutes--not even to give us water. when they came to take our drink order, it took another 10-15 minutes for them to bring it to us--the place wasn't packed and there were servers all over the place and ours was nowhere to be found. a different server came over to bring a beer and then our actual server finally came with my iced tea and 1 water even though there were 2 of us. we were sure to order the app and entree at the same time since it was apparent it would take awhile. the appetizer came at a normal speed--after taking 2 bites,  a completely different server came with the entree--great timing and communication. as were finishing up the meal--i'm still taking bites from the plate,the server came back and asked if we were done...ok, i guess so. we then ordered a cheesecake to-go--she came back with the check and 15 minutes later the cheesecake came from yet another server. how many people does it take to serve 2 people? And how long? I know it just opened, but it was really disappointing to say the least."
