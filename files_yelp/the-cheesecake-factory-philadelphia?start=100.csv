Marcie B.,"Suitland, Suitland, MD",0,2,,1.0,5/1/2017,"I visited Philly this past weekend from Washington, DC, and decided to go to the Cheesecake Factory. You can never go wrong with the Cheesecake Factory, or so I thought, especially since it's one of my favorite budget places to eat, the food is always plentiful, reasonably priced, and tasty. Well, that's until this last visit. First, let me start by saying this is a BEAUTIFUL location but, unfortunately the service and quality of food does not match the atmosphere. I've never received such horrible service in my life. It was slow, unorganized and downright shameful. My dish (Four Cheese Pasta) was made twice and still was not right. I spoke with the manager and she apologized and offered to make it over a third time. At that point, I was over the whole experience and was ready to travel back to my own city where the Cheesecake Factory service is excellent, and the food is even better. If you're ever in Philly, avoid this location like the plague. It's doing the franchise a disservice."
Chucky R.,"Vancouver, Canada",0,33,,1.0,10/28/2016,"first time visiting Philly for business. Decided to check it out this place with my colleagues. Great atmosphere, nice decorations but quite dimmed light inside.  Now, we had an awful awful server that night. She was extremely rude, first I thought she was joking cause I thought it cant be this bad. I think she must be mad at management or something. I didn't have one of these servers for long time. My food didn't show up for maybe 20 minutes after everyone elses arrived. I had to wait to get our servers attention to let her know about the situation cause she didn't even come back to check on my colleagues food after she dropped it. She didn't even apologise, she didn't even offer discount. I guess this must be lack of management supervision. cause she was not caring anything all night long. It must be hard not to notice that by floor manager. Anyways, such a terrific experience."
Deirdre W.,"Havertown, PA",4,23,,2.0,12/18/2015,"There are MANY better dining options in Center City. This place looks great, I'll give it that. But the food was just OK and the cocktails are super pricey.  I don't typically go for the big chain restaurants, but I gamely went along today for a CF holiday work lunch for 12. I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich and was served way more bread than chicken. The fries on the side weren't very good. My friend ordered the soup and salad combo and they only had one soup on the menu, which was clam chowder. It was too peppery for her and the waitress offered to substitute fries for the soup, but there was no apology or flexibility on the substitution. (My friend declined the fries.)  When we got the check, I realized that my sangria was $11.50, almost the same as my entree. Whaaaat? It wasn't even very good. I checked out other Yelpers' reviews and read that they don't put the cocktail prices on the menu. Not cool!"
Will D.,"Philadelphia, PA",262,5,,2.0,4/16/2017,"Had a disappointing visit on a Saturday Night. Got Seated in immediately, but it took 30-40 min until our waitress came in to check with us. The place wasn't even busy yet it took 40 minutes for our waitress to check in with us. We ordered the steak and pasta. The steak was good but the pasta was disappointing. The pasta was very bland and the chicken was very dry. Service is very weak here."
Amy B.,"Philadelphia, PA",80,342,25,4.0,12/7/2015,"I went here tonight with friends based on one of their recommendations and my inkling to want to try it out. We ate a table near the bar and had very friendly waitstaff who were quite accommodating but a little bit slow, the restaurant/bar area wasn't very crowded.  We each had a beverage and a skinny-liscious appetizer.  It took awhile for the food to arrive, I had a trio of lettuce wrapped tacos which were messy but very good. One friend enjoyed his flatbread pizza which sounded and looked delish, my other friend enjoyed her app but part of it wasn't great, I tried it and wasn't impressed.  All in all it was a fun evening, the music and ambiance was nice. $49 for 3 apps, 1 drink, 1 soft drink seems a little steep to me.  We were all hoping for a light, skinny- licious desserts which they don't offer. I will probably still come again but I was hoping for more."
Cam M.,"Southern Pines, NC",4,14,1,1.0,10/4/2015,"WORST BRUNCH EVER! If only zero stars were an option. My wife and I decided to give CCF a try for brunch today. As we came in the door there was no one greeting at the bottom of the escalator. So we ventured up to the restaurant and we were seated right away on the patio. The server was just straight preoccupied. As it took so long that we gave our drink order and food order at the same time. When he returned with our drinks my wife's tea cup was filthy. When the server returned he immediately said ""oh I forgot to tell you, we're out of French toast.""  The restaurant serves so much bread how are they out of toast. Maybe they are out of eggs? We ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes as a replacement.   While waiting for our food we noticed our server serving bread to other tables. So we asked can we have some bread.  ""Oh ya I forgot"".  Our food came out before he returned with the bread. My dish was supposed to come with toasted bread. ""Oh sorry they burned it I will bring some out."" My crab Benedict was fine one of the eggs was over cooked. My wife's pancakes that we're supposed to be lemon ricotta were just plain pancakes.  When I complained to the server. He said the lemon ricotta was inside.   Well folks I cut a bite out of the center of each pancake and the lemon ricotta was lie, none found. I complained again. ""I'll let my manager know"".  When he returned he told me his manager took our drinks off the bill.  I know this trick, he didn't talk to anyone he just hadn't added our drinks to the bill yet. Fine, I'm not looking for a free meal. I just want it to be done and served correctly. So we asked for some syrup for our plain pancakes. We were told they don't have any except for the melted butter they served with the pancakes....  Thus my wife's pancakes were now non edible.   Our server then told us that the Cheesecake Factory doesn't do brunch well at all and that we should have come for lunch or dinner instead. Way to talk about your own restaurant! Why even offering a brunch menu if you aren't going to offer it correctly? Safe to say this will be my first and last visit to the tourist factory there are way to many good restaurants in Philly to waste your time in a non-customer oriented atmosphere. I HATE writing bad reviews! But, I will when a service provider shows me they don't care!"
Rizwan A.,"Philadelphia, PA",82,199,32,1.0,9/17/2015,"Avoid. This is unfortunately the poorest rendition of the cheesecake factory that I've ever been to. Seeing as how they are the best restaurant in the world normally, I even tried this particular location twice, but each time was just as awful. As an avid cheesecake factory enthusiast, I have to give this location 0 stars, even the pre-made, frozen cheesecake could not be prepared properly by the staff.  The first time I ate here, my entree came with the wrong type of chicken, which I didnt' care about but it was just mistake number 1 of what, ten? I lost count. The waiters here disappear. You can even get up and go look for them but unless you know where the secret time warp portal is located you'll have zero luck entering their dimension to ask for something. I disliked that I had to ask for a refill, ask for a napkin, ask for a straw, ask for a box, ask for an actual box, ask for a normal sized box rather than the 10'' by 10'' box for my leftover cheesecake, and then also have to ask for a bag.  I didn't like how the cheesecake was served warm and melting, without whipped creme, and without any acknowledgement.  I didn't like waiting for over 45 minutes for my food. Will not be back, the KoP will have to do."
Miliardo P.,"Philadelphia, PA",13,108,3,3.0,9/1/2015,"Ok, this is weird! I had pretty good food and fantastic service at the bar. The food wasn't quite as good as King of Prussia but they're new so I was willing to write that off because they're still new.  So I got five star service and four star food,  so why a three star review?  I've been going out to dinner for over three decades and have never experienced anything like this.  I also have a pretty good sense of humor and am generally hard to offend.  All that being said,  onto the story.  While eating at the bar a server came up and asked me,  who won the superbowl three years ago.  I told her I didn't know but I could Google it, she then began to berate me for not knowing and walked away. I just shrugged and went back to eating.  Three minutes later,  she asked and I quote ""Where would you most likely wake up with a finger in your ass"". I had absolutely nothing,  wasn't even sure how to reply to that. Then I was treated to stories about how she came to work high everyday and what drugs she uses etc... AND SHE KEPT COMING BACK!!!!! I don't know if she was high then or if she thought she was funny,  but I hurried up to finish my food and get out because it was just uncomfortable.  Worse part, they don't wear name tags so I can't tell you who she was. If the powers that be are reading this: she was the VERY obnoxious server working 8/25/15 @ 9pm. And if by any chance you're reading this maam, you're not funny but disrespectful to a patron who was just trying to enjoy a dinner"
Keia F.,"Philadelphia, PA",12,1,8,1.0,5/17/2016,"Where do I begin? I tried to give #cheesecakefactory downtown Philly a try. As soon as we walked in (myself,a friend and my daughter) the host was in the back so she came about 5 mins which wasn't bad but she had attitude and didn't give her a kids menu. Okay! fine not a big deal, but as we're walking almost every table we passed was dirty! I mean DISGUSTING, while the waitresses and waiters was talking with each other. We sit down and the host begins to give her silverware(DIRTY SILVERWARE) we expressed we wanted plastic BC the silverware was so dirty her respond was to one talk to our waiter about that and two put the DIRTY( I mean food still on the fork dirty) back into the draw to give to other customers! (red flag) next I ordered a glass of Merlot .. I should've took a picture of my glass but it was so dirty my friend took it back to the bar BC it was greasy like someone literally just had a drink and they washed it with water and poured my wine in there. My friend took the wine back, spoke with the manager about how dirty the restaurant was, instead of him bringing the wine back asking did we need anything or just see how dirty the place was he sent a waiter. Now, someone comes and looks at the silverware ( not a Mgr) and begins to wipe he DIRTY silverware with a cloth .. A CLOTH! Not rewash them but a cloth! DISGUSTING!  On top of everything, the waiters , omg their clothes were gross like they were in the back cooking the food themselves! Yes it was bad. Next to us was a set up where they came the dirty dishes (I guess and ice tea along with a register when everything was gross. I'm also attaching photos BC just expressing it isn't enough. So, all of this honestly probably happened within 15-20 mins tops. We got up walked over to the mgr.which is never came back to make sure i even  received my wine and his respond was l'm embarrassed this place looks like this but I'm just coming in and trying to fix it , we expressed when trying to fix it first you need to rewash your dishes NOT wipe with a cloth! Also, as we are getting up from our table we were expressing it to another waiter with how dirty the place was and HE AGREED! Saying yeah I understand you guys are totally right it's dirty in here I'm sorry you guys had to come in and witness but we were confused BC everyone was standing around literally doing nothing while tables were still dirty ! I will never eat downtown Philly or even a drink at the Cheesecake Factory! My experience was horrible! I would not recommend anyone eating downtown Cheesecake Factory unless you want to get sick BC they don't clean anything! I have NEVER experienced anything like this before! Customer service was horrible,  eating there was not an option at this point! Totally unacceptable!!"
Meg W.,"Evesham Township, NJ",28,2,,1.0,12/20/2015,"Will not eat at this location again. Started with them telling us an hour wait. So we put in our name and came back 55mins later. At that point they said we were one of the next tables. Well 30 mins later we will were not called. We went up to complain and were told they were cleaning our table. 15 mins later we finally got seated. Total wait time was 1 HR 40 mins which is pretty ridiculous considering that when we got seated there were 4 large clean empty tables around us.  The server was prompt and polite. I had no problems with him. We put our order in immediately with our drink orders. We got our bread and it was not warm and was very hard on the outside. When the runners brought out our entrees they only brought 2 of the 5 out. 5 mins later (yes I actually monitored the time) the other 3 entrees came out. 2 of the entrees were wrong. My husband ordered spaghetti and received a sandwich and I ordered a burger and received a piece of meat on hard bread, nothing else was on the burger. I told the waiter and he apologized. I told the waiter to take back my incorrect food and that I did not want my food replaced so just take it off the bill which he did. They brought my husbands correct entree, but at that point everyone else at the table was already done.  By the end we were annoyed and just ordered the strawberry shortcake to share. The ice cream was good but the biscuit was very hard and inedible.  Definitely will not be returning!!"
Sing L.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,11,,2.0,10/4/2015,"I have been to only 2 locations for The Cheesecake Factory. This one and the one in KoP. I was amazed by how good the food was when I had my first Cheesecake Factory experience at KoP, so I was thrilled to find out they were opening one up in center city.  I went a couple days after they opened and I was fairly upset with the quality. The pasta was just not as good and the hibachi steak was not as flavorful. The mashed potatoes had huge chunks in it, which kind of ruined that. I figured, they just opened up so maybe they will get better with time. Went there a second time hoping for a better experience but my hopes were shot down. The service was a little worse, which was already a bad start. I got the Louisiana Chicken Pasta this time and it was not as great as I was hoping. The pasta was decent but the chicken was incredibly bland. My girlfriend got the Steak Diane and Shrimp Scampi combo which is a let down. The shrimp was burnt and the steak was too salty. The mashed potatoes once again had huge chunks. Is it that hard to make proper mashed potatoes? We left that night with a Kahlua cheesecake to go because we had to get out of there. I don't know whether it's the thought of that Cheesecake Factory being a disappointment compared to the one at KoP that made the cheesecake a little worse or the fact that it was actually worse. Nevertheless, if you want Cheesecake Factory, take the drive and go to the one at KoP."
Debra W.,"Glendale, AZ",0,7,,1.0,9/20/2016,"Yuck, Yuck and Yuck!! This is not the normal cheesecake factory. Usually I really like Cheesecake factory, but not this one.  The hostess was great. That was all.  Sat at a high top bar table; the waiter seemed as if we were a bother being there and making him work.  The fettuccini alfredo was gross, the noodles were soggy, and clumped together.  When the busser was setting a table across from us, he touched the fork tines, the eating part of the spoon and the knives. Leaned over the clean plates to set the far settings. Used a dirty napkin to wipe the table.  Don't waste your time...find a better place."
Carmel M.,"East Meadow, NY",2,12,17,5.0,8/22/2016,"Party of 4 and we were seated right away. Ordered the old fashioned burger, well done. Everything was great, and we all had exactly what we ordered. Too full to have dessert. Will come back to just have the Godiva chocolate cheesecake next time."
Lucy S.,"Los Angeles, CA",38,141,12,4.0,8/21/2016,Great for a treat if you go to college in Center City! It's delicious as any other CF and the waitstaff is nice and accommodating.
Dana S.,"Philadelphia, PA",54,247,30,3.0,1/5/2016,"It's gorgeous. A+ on the renovations of the building. Which also lends to big pluses on atmosphere. They are accommodating of all group sizes also another positive. They food there I have had has been solid and they are pretty accommodating with patrons amending their order. The service is average not terrible but nothing to note. My only hiccup is that everything on their menu gigantic and very high calorie. Even the ""skinilicious"" menu I question. Tough place for someone trying to eat healthy and not for anyone not looking for lots of food. That's just a personal preference though take from it what you will."
Suzette A.,"Philadelphia, PA",13,157,82,5.0,8/17/2015,"Service was very quick. I sat by the bar to watch the TV. The bartender Paul was great and pleasant. The bathrooms were clean! Seems like a very busy restaurant on a regular basis but it wasn't that busy on a Sunday. Trying to find parking is a nightmare unless you planned to be out and about all day and found a good spot or paid for the garage. Overall, food, cheesecake and drinks were great. Service was on Q and no waiting around. I am not sure how busy this place is on a Friday or Saturday but then again most places are mobbed on weekends regardless. Recommend it!"
Retna S.,"Philadelphia, PA",25,97,253,3.0,6/6/2016,Service was poor although our waiter was nice. We had to ask for menu and bread. Utensils were not clean. We had to ask them to be replaced. Ahi tuna tataki salad was good and well seasoned with nice complementing dressing.
Nat M.,"Philadelphia, PA",27,255,577,3.0,8/27/2015,"I usually Love going to Cheescake Factory and was very excited when they opened a branch in Center City. So I went to check them out Wednesday night and the venue didn't disappoint. They had a wall of windows that gave a good city view and the decor was typical for their restaurants. I decided to order a dish I've had before at the KOP site - the lemon and garlic shrimp with asparagus and angel hair pasta (off the low cal menu). While the taste of the dish was fine, the sauce had a weird gelatinous quality that limited my enjoyment. The cheesecake was great as usual."
Jojo C.,"Philadelphia, PA",3,25,130,3.0,12/19/2015,"It was a bit crowded and the service at this location was slow and not very outgoing. Our server was unfriendly, slow, and took forever just to get our order right and delivered. The food was ok but I like that they had so many choices to choose from. And the cheesecakes are amazing! The best!"
Eunni C.,"Manhattan, NY",248,234,69,3.0,8/14/2015,"It is so lame but this was chain restaurant I really wanted to try haha. I just heard about this place a lot- huge portion, good dessert etc however I've  never seen this place anywhere in city. Now I finally went!  Stopped by for lunch, got Alfredo fettuccini ( lunch portion) with chicken and classic burger with fries. We thought that would be safe choice since it was our first visit. Pasta was very thick, creamy like other chain restaurant. Chicken breast was moist and tender. My hubby enjoyed his burger and couldn't finish his fries. We were full so had original cheese cake piece to go.  Our server was very friendly and had full of smile on her face whenever we sees her.  Food was nothing ordinary but service was nice and I like to have this restaurant in the city."

Also, as we are getting up from our table we were expressing it to another waiter with how dirty the place was and HE AGREED! Saying yeah I understand you guys are totally right it's dirty in here I'm sorry you guys had to come in and witness but we were confused BC everyone was standing around literally doing nothing while tables were still dirty ! I will never eat downtown Philly or even a drink at the Cheesecake Factory! My experience was horrible! I would not recommend anyone eating downtown Cheesecake Factory unless you want to get sick BC they don't clean anything! I have NEVER experienced anything like this before! Customer service was horrible,  eating there was not an option at this point! Totally unacceptable!!"
Meg W.,"Evesham Township, United States",28,2,,1.0,20/12/2015,"Will not eat at this location again. Started with them telling us an hour wait. So we put in our name and came back 55mins later. At that point they said we were one of the next tables. Well 30 mins later we will were not called. We went up to complain and were told they were cleaning our table. 15 mins later we finally got seated. Total wait time was 1 HR 40 mins which is pretty ridiculous considering that when we got seated there were 4 large clean empty tables around us.  The server was prompt and polite. I had no problems with him. We put our order in immediately with our drink orders. We got our bread and it was not warm and was very hard on the outside. When the runners brought out our entrees they only brought 2 of the 5 out. 5 mins later (yes I actually monitored the time) the other 3 entrees came out. 2 of the entrees were wrong. My husband ordered spaghetti and received a sandwich and I ordered a burger and received a piece of meat on hard bread, nothing else was on the burger. I told the waiter and he apologized. I told the waiter to take back my incorrect food and that I did not want my food replaced so just take it off the bill which he did. They brought my husbands correct entree, but at that point everyone else at the table was already done.  By the end we were annoyed and just ordered the strawberry shortcake to share. The ice cream was good but the biscuit was very hard and inedible.  Definitely will not be returning!!"
Sing L.,"Philadelphia, United States",0,11,,2.0,4/10/2015,"I have been to only 2 locations for The Cheesecake Factory. This one and the one in KoP. I was amazed by how good the food was when I had my first Cheesecake Factory experience at KoP, so I was thrilled to find out they were opening one up in center city.  I went a couple days after they opened and I was fairly upset with the quality. The pasta was just not as good and the hibachi steak was not as flavorful. The mashed potatoes had huge chunks in it, which kind of ruined that. I figured, they just opened up so maybe they will get better with time. Went there a second time hoping for a better experience but my hopes were shot down. The service was a little worse, which was already a bad start. I got the Louisiana Chicken Pasta this time and it was not as great as I was hoping. The pasta was decent but the chicken was incredibly bland. My girlfriend got the Steak Diane and Shrimp Scampi combo which is a let down. The shrimp was burnt and the steak was too salty. The mashed potatoes once again had huge chunks. Is it that hard to make proper mashed potatoes? We left that night with a Kahlua cheesecake to go because we had to get out of there. I don't know whether it's the thought of that Cheesecake Factory being a disappointment compared to the one at KoP that made the cheesecake a little worse or the fact that it was actually worse. Nevertheless, if you want Cheesecake Factory, take the drive and go to the one at KoP."
Debra W.,"Glendale, United States",0,7,,1.0,20/9/2016,"Yuck, Yuck and Yuck!! This is not the normal cheesecake factory. Usually I really like Cheesecake factory, but not this one.  The hostess was great. That was all.  Sat at a high top bar table; the waiter seemed as if we were a bother being there and making him work.  The fettuccini alfredo was gross, the noodles were soggy, and clumped together.  When the busser was setting a table across from us, he touched the fork tines, the eating part of the spoon and the knives. Leaned over the clean plates to set the far settings. Used a dirty napkin to wipe the table.  Don't waste your time...find a better place."
Carmel M.,"East Meadow, United States",2,12,17,5.0,22/8/2016,"Party of 4 and we were seated right away. Ordered the old fashioned burger, well done. Everything was great, and we all had exactly what we ordered. Too full to have dessert. Will come back to just have the Godiva chocolate cheesecake next time."
Lucy S.,"Los Angeles, United States",38,141,12,4.0,21/8/2016,Great for a treat if you go to college in Center City! It's delicious as any other CF and the waitstaff is nice and accommodating.
Dana S.,"Philadelphia, United States",54,247,30,3.0,5/1/2016,"It's gorgeous. A+ on the renovations of the building. Which also lends to big pluses on atmosphere. They are accommodating of all group sizes also another positive. They food there I have had has been solid and they are pretty accommodating with patrons amending their order. The service is average not terrible but nothing to note. My only hiccup is that everything on their menu gigantic and very high calorie. Even the ""skinilicious"" menu I question. Tough place for someone trying to eat healthy and not for anyone not looking for lots of food. That's just a personal preference though take from it what you will."
Suzette A.,"Philadelphia, United States",13,157,82,5.0,17/8/2015,"Service was very quick. I sat by the bar to watch the TV. The bartender Paul was great and pleasant. The bathrooms were clean! Seems like a very busy restaurant on a regular basis but it wasn't that busy on a Sunday. Trying to find parking is a nightmare unless you planned to be out and about all day and found a good spot or paid for the garage. Overall, food, cheesecake and drinks were great. Service was on Q and no waiting around. I am not sure how busy this place is on a Friday or Saturday but then again most places are mobbed on weekends regardless. Recommend it!"
Retna S.,"Philadelphia, United States",25,97,253,3.0,6/6/2016,Service was poor although our waiter was nice. We had to ask for menu and bread. Utensils were not clean. We had to ask them to be replaced. Ahi tuna tataki salad was good and well seasoned with nice complementing dressing.
Nat M.,"Philadelphia, United States",27,255,577,3.0,27/8/2015,"I usually Love going to Cheescake Factory and was very excited when they opened a branch in Center City. So I went to check them out Wednesday night and the venue didn't disappoint. They had a wall of windows that gave a good city view and the decor was typical for their restaurants. I decided to order a dish I've had before at the KOP site - the lemon and garlic shrimp with asparagus and angel hair pasta (off the low cal menu). While the taste of the dish was fine, the sauce had a weird gelatinous quality that limited my enjoyment. The cheesecake was great as usual."
Jojo C.,"Philadelphia, United States",3,25,130,3.0,19/12/2015,"It was a bit crowded and the service at this location was slow and not very outgoing. Our server was unfriendly, slow, and took forever just to get our order right and delivered. The food was ok but I like that they had so many choices to choose from. And the cheesecakes are amazing! The best!"
Eunni C.,"Manhattan, United States",248,234,69,3.0,14/8/2015,"It is so lame but this was chain restaurant I really wanted to try haha. I just heard about this place a lot- huge portion, good dessert etc however I've  never seen this place anywhere in city. Now I finally went!  Stopped by for lunch, got Alfredo fettuccini ( lunch portion) with chicken and classic burger with fries. We thought that would be safe choice since it was our first visit. Pasta was very thick, creamy like other chain restaurant. Chicken breast was moist and tender. My hubby enjoyed his burger and couldn't finish his fries. We were full so had original cheese cake piece to go.  Our server was very friendly and had full of smile on her face whenever we sees her.  Food was nothing ordinary but service was nice and I like to have this restaurant in the city."
