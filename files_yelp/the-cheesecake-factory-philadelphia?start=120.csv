Eli A.,"Philadelphia, PA",92,82,70,5.0,2/27/2017,The servers work very hard here and are extremely friendly. I came one day with family and I really wanted to order the Filet Mignon steak they were sold out instead I ordered the pasta dish and it was amazing!
Sharan J.,"Philadelphia, PA",29,51,1,4.0,7/16/2015,"Went to Cheesecake Factory on Tuesday with my husband, brother, and friend. When you're going to the cheesecake factory you know what you're going to get - it's a chain restaurant with a menu that has pages and pages of options! We didn't have any sort of wait and were seated right away. This Cheesecake Factory looks like any normal Cheesecake Factory, however, what I did like was they have a seating area where the windows are open which is really nice. We put in a drink order and an order of the Hot Spinage and Cheese Dip.  The drinks and appetizer came promptly. Our waitress was pretty knowledgeable..  apparently during the training they had to learn the whole menu and got to try most of the food for 2 whole weeks! For our entrees we went with the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta, Herb Crusted Filet of Salmon, and Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic. The Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic was the best dish out of them all and we'll definitely be going back for that dish!  The only complaint was that we wanted the Snickers Cheesecake, however, they were out of the ingredients so we ended up going with the Tiramisu Cheesecake and S'mores Cheesecake - both equally yummy!"
Liz P.,"Washington, DC",391,96,376,3.0,7/17/2015,"Great restaurant, just not this location. After being CCF-lovers for quite some time, the service at this location let us down. Randomly stumbling in on a Monday night, my friends and I were seated immediately. The nightmare began when our waiter first approached the table to greet us and asked us if we had any questions about the menu, after waiting and waiting, he brought out only three waters.. when there was clearly four of us. We proceeded to place our orders, and after patiently waiting for our food and breadsticks, nothing. We called over the waiter and asked ""hi may we have our breadsticks?"" he replies, ""oh, you want breadsticks? sure"". We were very disappointed at the fact that we may have never received breadsticks if we had never asked. Not to mention, we finished our waters and had to sit around waiting for the waiter that never came to check up on our table. If we wanted more water, we had to wave over our server. So finally, our pasta dishes and pizza arrive at the table. It looks absolutely delicious, as always; however, the server did not bring out cheese. Trying to get the server's attention (once again), we waited for him to grab the cheese for the pasta. Another disappointment. Despite the upsetting service, the food was still extraordinary. If you want a pleasant dining experience, I would suggest going to another CCF location or ordering take out."
Myrna S.,"Mill Creek, Philadelphia, PA",2,12,6,5.0,7/9/2016,Just had the plain cheesecake it was wonderful I can't wait to go back to enjoy some of the other great things they offer . The place is beautiful and the staff is GREAT !!! Can't wait to go back
Kimberly V.,"Phoenixville, PA",149,18,,1.0,7/8/2016,Found a cockroach in my salad tonight. Alive. Management handled it well but yuck. How does a cockroach get tossed into your salad?!
Elli H.,"Malmö, Sweden",4,30,16,4.0,11/19/2015,"My first visit to a CF, had a great experience. Had steak with mashed potatoes with Asian influences. Was amazing. Had a piece of salted caramel cheesecake for desert, we were three people sharing it but could not finish it. Very full tummy! Nice staff but tables were a bit .. Unprivate. Close to the next table."
N T.,"New York, NY",0,11,,5.0,8/9/2016,"Beautiful, especially for a space in Philly! I love the variety. It is a chain but they do it very well."
Adrien C.,"Woluwé-Saint-Pierre, Brussels, Belgium",31,12,12,4.0,8/29/2015,"Amazing cheesecake, just too bad they don't have smaller size since it comes in a huge size and it gets hard to finish in the end. Good enough for a dinner tough. The personnel isn't very kind I must admit"
Cy W.,"Philadelphia, PA",123,2,,3.0,8/7/2016,"What else can you expect from the Cheesecake Factory? It's pretty mediocre food that costs more than it should and has slow service. However, the building is very nice and the atmosphere is quite pleasant. The Cheesecake Factory served its purpose of a decent meal that left us satisfied overall."
Emily S.,"Decatur, Atlanta, GA",106,58,56,1.0,5/15/2016,I have always enjoyed Cheesecake Factory for their large serving sizes and delicious food. Tonight I was underwhelmed. My portion of pasta carbonara was very small and the pasta was underdone and chewy. The smoked bacon was burnt and almost in recognizable. The service was extremely slow. Overall I am extremely disappointed.
Natasha S.,"Philadelphia, PA",10,63,70,5.0,10/13/2015,I love this place! I came here with a few co workers for lunch and knew that I was leaving with a slice of cheesecake. Absolutely sinful!!
Radhi K.,"Sanford, Orlando, FL",12,53,2,4.0,4/8/2016,"This place is awesome! If you just want a casual but sort of classy night out or lunch eat here! I went here for happy hour last week which was my first time! I love their happy hour i never even knew it existed until my friend told me! The cocktails are 5$ and beers are 4$ and their starters and small plates are 5$ and original sized. It was totally worth it! My friend and I had 3 drinks each and 2 small plates, paid 20$ for a great time! Their drinks are strong and the waiter was amazing. I hate how this place doesnt have proper reservation timings and its more of a wait. It gets a bit chaotic but totally worth it!"
John R.,"Philadelphia, PA",4,44,1,5.0,6/25/2015,Went here two days in a row and each time entire experience was tremendous. Food was great. Service spot   huge & very busy with the other patrons food all looking  great and all seemingly enjoying themselves. servings are huge ..I'm not a big fan of cheese cake and never order it.however since I was there I felt obligated to try..it was delectable & a huge piece enough to share .. An army of staff all with a outstanding attitude and friendly professionalism thats unfortunately not all that common anymore . Big fan and i would highly recommend !
Kat S.,"Philadelphia, PA",138,62,102,4.0,7/1/2015,"When my coworker suggested we go here for lunch, I couldn't believe it was built already! We stopped in for lunch with only an hour to spare and I was a little worried we would make it back in time. However, I was pleasantly surprised! The staff was very friendly and our server made her present known but didn't hover. I ordered the Beets & Goat Cheese and Edamame. Both dishes were good. My friend got the Turkey Burger, which she enjoyed. For a chain restaurant, this was a good experience. I would definitely return for lunch!"
Khanh V.,"Philadelphia, PA",100,295,894,3.0,6/23/2015,"Came here on opening day for lunch with friends and it was crowded within just 7 mins after opening. The place is definitely nice looking, fancy. The service was good and friendly. I ordered miso salmon. It took awhile to get here but it was good. Fish was cooked right. The miso sauce is a sweet creamy and soy base. It's not quite my thing sweet and savory. My friend said her food was a bit salty. Usually at the Cheesecake Factory is a hit or miss. Overall a good experience minus the manager guy not letting people upstairs because it is crowded or overwhelming."
Bebilov G.,"Philadelphia, PA",43,5,22,5.0,7/2/2015,"Went there for lunch with my husband & my newborn. I loved the food, ambience is pretty nice...we sat on the patio. Would definitely go back again!"
Marge R.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,10,16,5.0,1/8/2016,Lived up to its reputation! Outstanding food....and the cheesecake. Thank goodness I don't live that close!
Turquoise M.,"Philadelphia, PA",95,1,34,3.0,7/2/2015,The food was okay nothing to hype about. The service was slow I waited about 45mins until my food arrived. The staff there are very friendly & opening....The best part was dessert which they are known for Cheesecake.
Antonio D.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,16,1,5.0,8/7/2015,The food was the best!  Fort time trying their food because it was always so far. I'm glad they opened one in the city and it would be great for them to be in restaurant week in the future ! !
Luis F.,"Lakeland, FL",9,18,37,5.0,7/11/2015,"Omg !!! The best place for a nice dinner in Philadelphia, as always Cheesecake factory!!"
