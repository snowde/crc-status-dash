Tori T.,"Wilmington, DE",0,2,2,3.0,3/18/2016,"The food was good, but the service was extremely bad! I asked for ONE minute to decide and the waitress comes back TEN minutes later. Not to mention she glanced my way a few times and noticed that I was ready to order. Extremely disappointed that the service sucked since the food was good. Not saying I haven't had good experiences before but this is was pretty bad. The table was not thoroughly cleaned and the wait time for a seat (when the restaurant was nearly empty) was way too long."
Lisa Y.,"Market East, Philadelphia, PA",1,13,6,1.0,9/7/2016,"My co-workers and I went to the Cheesecake Factory to meet over lunch. Upon our arrival, one of my co-workers saw a roach on the floor, we thought that might have been a single incident until after being seated at our table; we placed our orders, was engaged in discussion at which point one of my co-workers saw another roach on the back of my seat, after some bewilderment, we get up, while another of my co-workers kill the roach; the manager comes over and offers us a seat in another location, we say fine; until while standing waiting to be seated we see yet another roach crawling on another seat. The manager acknowledged that there had just been extermination. At that point we all opted to leave the establishment as none of us had much of an appetite after that incident. I highly recommend that extermination be done after hours and allow enough time so that bugs such as roaches be totally eliminated before the establishment reopens. Unfortunately, I will not be back to that particular Cheesecake Factory and will probably be suspicious of others. If the dining area was like that, I can only imagine how things were in the kitchen where there's much more food."
Bianca J.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,3,,1.0,11/18/2016,"I just had the worst shrimp scampi I've ever had. This cheesecake factory's food is not up to par with the other restaurants of the chain that I have visited in the past. My whole dish was unsatisfactory with dried pasta that looked at least a couple hours old. My shrimp was unseasoned and left much to be desired. The waitress was ok, but associated too much with other staff on the job instead of being attentive. All in all, the King of Prussia and Cherry Hill locations offer better service and better food quality."
Lauren W.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,2,,2.0,3/14/2016,"I came here with a group of seven and we chose it to accommodate the large party and for a wide menu.  Both of those aspects were great, otherwise it was a disappointing experience.  We were seated instantly but then waited at least a half an hour for a sever to walk by.  Once they noticed us we finally got some water.  Three different servers came over and bickered to us about whose fault it was for the long wait.  There was then confusion as to who should take the order.  We asked for seven separate checks which one waitress said was okay and confused another.  Everyone apologized for the confusion but blamed each other and other factors instead of just apologizing.  Our waitress was somewhat curt and not particularly friendly.   Once we finally ordered, it took an unreasonable amount of time for our food to come (it was not crowded that night!).  The food was decent, about what was to be expected.  However, our waitress never asked if we wanted more drinks or really paid us much attention.   Once the meal was done, she brought us checks without asking if we wanted dessert!  Some of us wanted cheesecake (It is the Cheesecake Factory after all!) but since the whole process was so painful no one ordered anything.  She messed up three checks which took forever to sort out.   The food was fine but the service was extremely lacking.  All seven of us are extremely patient and understanding, yet everyone said they wouldn't be going back."
Elodie U.,"Philadelphia, PA",14,13,4,1.0,10/23/2016,"I went tonight with my friend, and as always, it was crowded. It was not my first time here. My first experience at this restaurant wasn't that good, but I decided to give it a second chance. The staff told us to wait 40 minutes so we did. They made us sit at ""the end of the bar"" which was two seats at a lower counter, so the barman barely saw us. Nobody came to give us a menu so we had to take one by ourselves. Nobody came to take our order for 15mn until we finally ask for someone. They didn't gave us water nor bread automatically, we had to ask for it. Every time. Even for forks, knives and napkins.  We wanted to change our seats because the counter was next to the restroom so many people were walking behind us. They gave us a ""beeper"" saying that we will have a table in 20mn. 20 mn later, an other woman was working at the front desk and she told me with in a condescending and annoyed way that I can't transfer from a table to another. Also the waiter didn't take our order correctly so we had to wait 35 mn total to finally have our food. I got the meatball pasta, which was really tasteless, my friend had the Miso Salmon, which wasn't bad. At the beginning we wanted some desert but we though that this place didn't deserved our money. This place looks nice and fancy at first but we realized fast enough that it is just a popular and overrated garbage. I never write reviews on places that I don't like but this will be an exception and I hope that the owners of The Cheesecake Factory will do something about their staff and terrible service in the future."
Doctor D.,"Chester Springs, PA",0,34,,1.0,4/17/2016,"Went with my wife for nice mid-week lunch but was very disappointed. The booth benches were covered with food, which probably came from what was swept off the table by the busboys that I saw doing it elsewhere.  But worst of all was the ball of hair left under the salt shaker by someone. Manager said I am sorry and deducted nothing from the bill.  She did wave goodbye though. Food was usual - decent with large quantities. Never again."
Christina K.,"Philadelphia, PA",4,2,1,1.0,11/28/2015,"I called to make a reservation tonight  was told "" we do not take reservations for 2 people"" I replied a bit confused and the girl on the phone hung up on me. She didn't try to accommodate  me or ensure that we would be able to get a table if we just walked in. As a manager of a restaurant I would be furious if I heard my employee interact with a potential customer this way. Needless to say I will not be going there tonight. Management: if you're not going to take reservations for 2 at least teach your employees to be a little more welcoming."
Heather G.,"Philadelphia, PA",3,48,2,4.0,3/9/2016,"This restaurant is really nice! Top floor is the only place for seating. The menu is huge, I always like to look online ahead of time. I got a peach Bellini to start with. It a very tasty but didn't taste alcoholic at all. Food was standard for Cheesecake Factory. The service was incredibly slow for a Monday night however. Waited an hour just to get our entrees. Can't imagine what it's like on a busy night. Food was good and so was the cheesecake so besides the service, 4 stars it is!"
Erin C.,"Philadelphia, PA",128,27,23,2.0,3/9/2016,Food is like every other Cheesecake Factory and is just enough to fill you up. However food takes forever to come out even on an early weekday lunch service.
Shonda Y.,"Philadelphia, PA",151,28,4,4.0,4/6/2016,"Pretty good food, definitely get a lot of it. It seems to always be busy here, but food never tales too long coming out. They have tons of variety with every meal of the day. Good for families, dates or girls night out."
fjafj f.,"Collegeville, PA",2,36,23,5.0,12/23/2015,"This review is only for Happy Hour. Monday - Friday 4p-6p. 5.50 for all drinks, a BROAD selection of appetizers, and the Happy Hour burger. This is seriously one of the BEST happy hours in Center City. The drinks actually taste like alcohol and almost everything is served in a regular glass (the kind you'd get for a regular soft drink). The bartenders are also very nice and friendly overall. I can't speak to anything other than happy hour and the delicious cheesecakes which I love. I personally think 7.95 for a cheesecake is great."
Gwendolyn P.,"Philadelphia, PA",48,582,72,5.0,1/28/2016,I am quite surprised by all of the negative reviews that I have read for this restaurant. I am not a stranger to fine dining and have been to several of the top restaurants not only in Philly but around the world so it is not like I have unsophisticated tastes or an unsophisticated palette and I can certainly recognize good service from poor service. I have only been to this restaurant once but what is not to like?  The venue is stunning and the location is superb.  The tables are set far apart from each other and the ceilings are very high making it easy to catch up with friends and loved ones in a seemingly private and quiet setting.  I found all of the wait staff to be very friendly and accommodating and there are tons of delicious and inexpensively priced items to choose from on the menu.  I appreciate that they offered a skinny menu and found the chopped salad on that menu to be amazing. At $12 I had it for dinner and for lunch the next day.  My friend and I started with the tuna carapacio which was wonderful and we also enjoyed our cocktails.  I don't think the overall three star review that this restaurant has is indicative of the experience that you will have there.
Sierra-katherine B.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,19,5,1.0,1/5/2016,"The worst service ever! Got there at 4:20, the booth we were put into was too small for the baby seat, and when we asked hostess about it she just walked away. Then we took it upon ourselves to move. Then after we ordered they brought it the wrong order to 2 out of the 3 of us. So while one is us was eating for 20 minutes the rest were just waiting for their correct order. The. Our waitress couldn't remember anything we were asking for and had to repeat everything to her. Then she left in the middle of purser vice and we got a second server. This server was nice and then we asked if we could split the bill. She was accommodating until she gave us the checks, we gave her out cards and then when we got the receipts the amount had changed on out of our checks from originally 35 to 42!! How the hell does that happen? Please explain how you randomly add 2 sodas to a check that was already correct before we gave you out cards. Then she wanted to know If that extra was ok or does she need to get her manager... Um yes get your manager.. Then she returned with 6$ in cash  without the manager... Mind you the overcharge was 7$ . At this point we were so frustrated we just took our tip back and left.  This was supposed to be a nice night out for me and my cousins but ended up being a night where our patience was tried. Will not be returning back here anytime soon: most likely will go to Max Brenner's around the corner... Very disappointed"
Tony C.,"Lansdowne, PA",23,21,4,3.0,4/19/2016,Best to go before noon and the lunch crowd. Nice view and food is adequate nothing special. Nice lunch portions.
Semi F.,"Brooklyn, NY",25,45,24,4.0,11/22/2015,"I have no idea why this place doesn't have high ratings because i've been almost all of the cheesecake factory in USA and this is one of the best. To be hones after Las Vegas, this is the best. Foods are good especially fried calamari is amazing, i know it's appetizer but it's really tasty. For main course fillet mignon is my favorite. I've been writing as everything is perfect but i put 4 stars because of service. They should improve their service that's the reason why i choose the 4 stars instead of 5... But definitely i'll be back..."
Maureen R.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,15,,5.0,10/16/2016,"Had Sunday night dinner this summer with my cousins from Ireland, party of 7. Service was great.  our meals and desserts were excellent.  Our server made sure all 7 meals arrived at the same time and recommended some great items. The Cheesecake factory was a highlight of my cousins' trip to NYC and Philadelphia.  Looking forward to my next meal there."
Laura K.,"Philadelphia, PA",5,125,,1.0,11/16/2015,"One star and only for the interior appearance. I got the garlic shrimp pasta with a basil lemon sauce and it was bland and doused in a ridiculous amount of oil. What a wasted $18. About $14 for a Ketel One martini, didn't realize I should expect Franklin Mortgage prices for a simple vodka martini. I was so turned off by my food that I didn't even get cheesecake for dessert (in hindsight, I should have just gone with dessert and skipped dinner there altogether).  The service was terrible, the hostesses were unfriendly and downright incompetent. Our server wasn't rude but definitely not very friendly and took forever to get us our round of drinks when it was mostly empty in the rest of the restaurant. Some of our table resorted to going up to the bar for their drinks, it was just so ridiculous. The general attitude is come in, spend a ridiculous amount of money for subpar food and it's ok because it's Cheesecake Factory. It shows a serious lack of management and the struggling waitstaff is indicative of poor training. I actually felt bad for our server that she was struggling with simple orders. I mean honestly how hard is it to make sure everyone has water refills? AVOID."
Chris T.,"Philadelphia, PA",91,23,39,2.0,12/6/2015,"I have been to many Cheesecake Factories, and this one was subpar. All the food was extremely salty and the zucchini appetizers looked like 8 French fries on the plate. The service was slow and the portions were smaller than I have expected from CF. The chicken was dry, I don't know what they are doing at this place."
Sarah H.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,9,6,1.0,1/30/2016,"Sub par service. Came with a group of 5 people 3pm on a Saturday. We ordered 4 salads and a soup, and it took 45 minutes to come out. There was a giant hair ball next to the table which solidified the experience. The cold soup, slow service, and soggy salads are the reasons I will never come back or recommend Cheesecake Factory to anyone"
Gloria H.,"WYNNEWOOD, PA",28,128,22,5.0,1/21/2016,I went to lunch at this Cheesecake Factory at 15th and Walnut today with some friends. We had a really comfy cozy booth in the room with the giant glass windows. I absolutely loved being able to have multiple views of the city skyline while eating lunch. The atmosphere was extremely pleasant and the food was tasty! Not a fan of all the calories on the menu................ but I guess they must have to do that!
