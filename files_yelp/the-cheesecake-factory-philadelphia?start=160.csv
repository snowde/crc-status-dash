David J.,"New York, NY",0,26,,4.0,5/2/2016,"Service is ok. Food is delicious. Just be aware, you are eating with mostly low class people so do not be fooled by the gourmet presentation of each menu item. Basically is 80% low class. 15% middle class and 5% high class people will eat here. So definitely don't bring a lot of money because there is a 40% chance you you will get jumped that day you choose to eat here. Obviously not in the restaurant, but some place near it. It's a great place to go to when your with a large amount of people because of the large variety of food. I recommend it as a backup place, but remember, the people your dealing with in this restaurant have little to no manners, meaning they will not say sorry for any reason, no excuse mes, no holding the door open, no saying thank you for holding the door open, these people that eat here are complete animals and will wait for a table no matter how long it is. Oh and the worst is when people dress up to go to this place..It's the fcking Cheesecake Factory, not Peter Lugers Givme a break"
Tony N.,"Philadelphia, PA",6,2,,1.0,9/18/2015,"Went to lunch with a friend.  My friend ordered a burger and I ordered a ""Make your Own Omelet"" to go.  I ordered: Egg white, pepper, onions, ham, and mushroom with sweet potato fries and wheat toast.  I paid whatever price.  20 minutes later, end result, I received an egg yellow omelet with mushroom and peppers and wheat toast.  I noticed it was wrong but I had to get back to work. They are batting less than .500 on my order.  Thanks Shannen N."
Anna M.,"Jenkintown, PA",285,12,13,2.0,7/21/2015,"I really hate to give such a low rating to a restaurant I usually always enjoy going to but that's as generous as I can get from my dining experience here. Before anything, I'm a huge fan of The Cheesecake Factory. I probably dine in my local location once every month or two so i thought i might give this new location a try. There were four of us seated and were eager to order. The inside of this Cheesecake factory is truly beautiful and has a great ambiance. Our server then brought out three waters when it was clear that there was one more person in our table. Everyone makes mistakes so we weren't so bothered by this. Time passed and we noticed that we didn't receive our breadsticks yet and our food was almost ready. We asked our server and all he could say was ""Oh, you want breadsticks?""... Our food came out and nothing to say about that, it was still as delicious as the other locations! However, our server didn't bring out cheese or serving spoons and we, once more had to ask our server for this. Come for the food but don't expect great service."
Yang X.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,197,,4.0,2/3/2016,"I went there for a birthday dinner with my friend. Surprisingly six or eight people had birthday on the same day so birthday song was with us all night. To be honest, I didn't like the server because of his attitude. It seemed that he didn't really want to serve us. We ordered cocktail, which was good. Crusted chicken and lettuce wrap were also very delicious. The only dish we didn't like was the grilled pork, which was overcooked and tough. Overall I loved this dinner and the environment so I gave this restaurant 4 star."
Richard P.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,4,,1.0,10/23/2015,"My third visit and you can sense the slow decline in what was pretty good service and quite good food (for the $) after only just under a month open.   Now the ""downstairs"" hostess is busy, busy on her cell phone and the ""upstairs"" desk staff is busy, busy looking bored, disinterested and talking among themselves.  The server staff is trying but management is, at best, focused on...who knows what...not the customers for sure. Seated at the tiniest, most crowded table in a half empty restaurant--I guess this was convenient for...the staff. When I asked for new table the manager was nearly dumbfounded and reluctantly reseated us after asking if we had ordered anything--I guess if we had ordered we would be punished by not being allowed to switch tables. (Actually our server finally took initiative and moved us since the manager was busy...talking with the hostesses.)  Food arrived at a reasonable pace and was C+---beef in Hibachi Beef was dryish but other items good. Tried to buy a piece of cheesecake (at almost $10 a pop) and couldn't get anybody to sell it to me. 1 counterperson--3 customers---all on a very slow night overall---while 2 hostesses and 2 mangers stood right next to cheesecake case chatting with each other. They hustled for the first few weeks--now they're just taking orders for pretty good food with diminishing service. Bottom line--almost faithful (local Center City eat-out-all-the-time nearby residents) are now twice a year customers...maybe...locals who wouldn't send visiting friends and relatives here for sure... As other reviewers have said...it could've been a hit but it's really just hit...and miss at CCF!"
Meredith L.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,7,,2.0,8/23/2016,"The building is beautiful, but the service is absolutely horrible. I came here with one other person during lunch on a Tuesday around 12:30pm, I did not leave until 2:15, and it really wasn't even that busy and we only order sandwiches. Most restaurants in center city are much more cognizant that the people who come in for lunch on a weekday have to be in and out, but not this place. I would be surprised if they stayed in business much longer if they keep this up."
Vince D.,"Philadelphia, PA",98,90,8,1.0,4/17/2016,"This review is for service only, the food is excellent and up to par with other Cheesecake Factory chain restaurants. I came here on a Sunday afternoon around 1pm so it was relatively slow, we were seated in a corner next to another family even though there were 15 empty tables in the same row where we could have been more spaced out. Normally I wouldn't mind this but the table next to us had screaming little kids, which is understandable but atleast don't sit a couple directly next to them when there are open tables elsewhere. About 15 minutes went by before we were even greeted about a drink, except we weren't greeted and asked if we wanted a drink we were simply brought waters and quickly asked if we were reading to order so without thinking we spouted out or order and remained drinkless, except the waters we were brought. The appetizer came out in decent time and the food quickly followed but we maybe saw our waitress once at this point and I asked to order a sparkling water and she said sure I'll bring it right out. 20 mins later still no drink, I had to ask another waiter to get it for me. Then when we were done eating we both had our napkins on the table clearly done eating for a solid 25 mins and our waitress went Missing and did not come back for the check. By the time she did we passed on desert because we were going on a 1.5 hour lunch at this point. I'm not sure I'll be back to this location pretty disappointing especially when you have a certain standard for Cheesecake Factory."
Mona D.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,20,,2.0,7/13/2015,This would be a 1 but the pizzas and flat bread were good.  4 of us went for lunch and waited an hour for our food. After 40 minutes I went to fron desk and they said sorry we will let manager know right away.  20 minutes later the food showed up. My friends salad no dressing.  The wrong salad for me and then when they brought it bac it had the wrong dressing poured on it and instead of taking it back brought me the right dressing for the side.  I guess they expected me to eat it with vinagerette and ranc. Ordered the portofino pizza and the server kept calling it portfolio.  It was all so horrible it was funny but to be honest a manager should have come to our tabe. Never again
Amanda Q.,"Williamstown, NJ",0,6,,5.0,2/3/2016,"Went here around 4 and got the lunch specials Herb Crusted Filet of Salmon  and Chicken Piccata. Both were brought out in a timely manner and cooked perfectly. Definitely recommend either dishes, and they were pretty big portions for a lunch special size. The atmosphere was quiet since this was before dinner rush, and our server was always there when we needed him. Got the Chocolate Mousse cheesecake that was to die for."
Amyy M.,"Philadelphia, PA",280,8,6,2.0,2/1/2016,"Our first server was very nice, although she didn't know much and had to check her notes a couple of times (which wasn't a problem at all) I ordered the steak medallions well done with out mushrooms (I'm allergic) the bring our food out and i look down and there's mushrooms. When they finally brought out my right food, it was not well done, closer to medium well.  Our table was rarely checked on, and we ran out of ketchup and butter and couldn't get more because no one came over unless they were bringing us something. Multiple other little things could be fixed as well, but the main thing being their attention to customer satisfaction. They did not do anything for us other than apologize for screwing up my order badly, which when it comes to allergies it should be taken more seriously. If this restaurant wasn't a chain I would most likely not return, however I'll try it again when they work out some of the kinks"
Sheila S.,"Haddonfield, NJ",0,17,,4.0,1/31/2016,"The service is awful at times and other times its superb. Not sure why this is so, but I have been there quite a few times. The food isn't out of this world. They do so many different cuisines because their menu is vast, but there isn't a single dish I am crazy for. However, they have amazing appetizers. Love their stuffed mushrooms, flatbreads, lettuce wraps, etc. It is for their appetizers they get a 4 instead of a 3."
Bob S.,"Philadelphia, PA",5,5,,1.0,6/25/2015,We recently received a sub-par key lime cheesecake and that's an understatement.  It was borderline rancid and it didn't help that it took forever to dethaw.  This was a supreme disappointment to our colleagues at the office who all agreed that it could very well be the absolute worst cheesecake ever made.  This was a 30 dollar waste on a 9 inch pie and will probably never order from here again although at least the customer service was satisfactory.
Dohee K.,"Philadelphia, PA",74,16,59,5.0,10/13/2015,"Great service with great food. The amount of food is more than what I expected and the taste was amazing. The Cheesecake Factory is not only for the desert place but for fantastic pastas with salad. In addition, the atmosphere is perfect for a date or hangout or day out with friends in anytime!"
Rondia F.,"Philadelphia, PA",4,1,5,5.0,9/5/2015,"was here monday with my neicey poohz,had a blast everything from the service to desert was truly impeccable!!"
Ck P.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,37,7,3.0,11/10/2015,"The Good: The space is wonderfully decorated and the service and food were fine.                   Most of the portions are large and easily splittable. NOTE: Allow time to wade thru the 16 page plus menu  (Oh, and there's a second menu for additional reading..........) Can we say overkill?????? The Bad: Be forewarned - this was one of the NOISIEST restaurants we've ever been in. The music was LOUD, the noise level in this place was VERY LOUD. We had trouble understanding each other from across the table. We did ask the manager to turn the music down and he graciously did turn it down a little. However there are all hard surfaces in this place so it was still an issue that we tried to ignore during our dinner. Finally our guest said she felt like she was shouting to be heard and was uncomfortable. We agreed and decided not order cheesecake (yes, we didn't order cheesecake at The Cheesecake Factory...) We just wanted to get out of the NOISE. We MAY try this for lunch, because we all liked the decor and menu choices are enormous. BUT, If the noise level is the same, we won't stay."
Tracey K.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,40,21,4.0,7/30/2015,"I love the Cheesecake Factory and was excited that one just opened in center city. Like the other locations I've visited, the food is so good and the portions are huge. Customer service was great which is another plus. Highly recommend the monte cristo for brunch."
Vic R.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,6,,1.0,1/19/2016,"This is my second bad experience at this Cheesecake Factory. The service was absolutely HORRIFIC! I have had some bad severs, but nothing comes close to what I have experienced twice in this place. My wife and I are a long time customers of Cheesecake Factory - in the past we ate there at least 2 times per week. I used to go to the ones in KOP and Cherry Hill. After this last time in the city, I will never EVER return! Servers are absolutely incompetent, lazy, careless, and snobs. Managers are WORTHLESS! Do not go there unless you want to treated like garbage. Take your business to Cherry Hill , KOP or any other restaurant in the city."
Todd L.,"New Providence, PA",2,19,10,5.0,10/29/2015,Awesome first time experience with The Cheesecake Factory! We were amazed at the selection of entrees and it took us a while to decide as it all sounded great. We opted for the Eggroll Sampler which was delicious all the way around the plate! Our entrees were very good and to finish it all off the cheesecake was phenomenal. Our server was also an absolute pleasure. We'll definitely be back!
Kavia S.,"Germantown, Philadelphia, PA",4,3,,1.0,6/20/2016,"Where do I begin?!?!  As soon as you enter, the hostess seems as if hurts to greet customers with a smile. We were a party of 7 and she told us the entire restaurant was full and there were no tables available (although there was no one waiting to be seated).  I found this concept hard to believe so I walked the floor of the restaurant and found a table that was available to accommodate us but it needed to be cleaned. I let the hostess know and she said she knew b/c they took an inventory (not sure why she didn't take inventory before telling us there were no seats). We waited another five minutes and then we were seated. Now we get the waitress who doesn't want to smile or acknowledge us. Smh. No pleasantries, no bread, took forever with the drinks, never apologized for any of the mishaps, and just outright rude. Stay clear of the Cheesecake Factory!  The food and service sucks!  The mashed potatoes were cold and my husband's Cajun jambalaya had NO flavor!  This location needs to close down or they need to get all new staff!  Smh"
Howard S.,"Philadelphia, PA",23,15,1,1.0,7/7/2015,"Large portions, that's the good part. I wanted so much to love their cheesecake, but it was frozen several times, dense, and the grahmcracker crust was gooey. One of the worst cheesecakes I've had."
