Nicole S.,"Silver Spring, MD",4,10,,3.0,10/10/2015,For a Saturday night we were started pretty quickly. Service was good and the food was fine. The cheesecake however was HORRIBLE. When the waitress came over I commented how tiny the slice was. It used to be enough to share but this piece was pretty much smaller than the two dollops of whipped cream. I ended up being happy that the piece was so small because it tasted really bad. The cheesecake part dry and crumbly. I guess I should thank them for helping me watch my calorie intake...
Nancy G.,"San Diego, CA",1,56,41,1.0,10/31/2015,"I love the Cheesecake Factory, I didn't have dinner there because we were in town for a marathon and we wanted to check out one of the local independent restaurants for dinner. We did stop by to grab dessert and take it to our room. I understand sometimes it's hard to assist a customer right away because the restaurant is busy. We waited for about 5 minutes before even being greeted. The staff was completely neglecting us along with 4 others waiting. I mean, I paid $18 for two pieces of cheesecake. At least make an attempt to be pleasant. Let's just say I won't be stopping by this location again."
Phyllis W.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,1,,4.0,12/27/2015,"My husband and I were serviced 12-27-15. Our sever (Edward M), appeared to be overwhelmed with his tables he was responsible for. He served the table on my right and left, but didn't acknowledge us right away. Five minutes later, he asked us for a drink order. We ordered. My Husband also mentioned, we didn't have saucers for our loaf of  bread. He came back with 2 saucers to accommodate us. Our dinner was very tasty. Although he forgot my vegetable, I waited and caught him at another table to tell him. He served us hastily. ÇF was good, but waiter was so so."
Matt C.,"BURLNGTN CITY, NJ",0,14,1,5.0,6/24/2015,"A+++++! Our server was great, everything we had was great. The managers came around to check on us and were very friendly and sincere. We had the artichoke appetizer and I highly recommend it. I suggest you park nearby, because you will have leftovers! Such a great addition to the city."
L W.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,11,,2.0,9/16/2015,"I enjoy cheesesteak factory enough to call it one of my favorites, but this location is becoming a joke. First strike, is dining in with over an hour wait for appetizers, only to get dirty plates and utensils to eat with. Second strike, ordering a Caesar salad to go with no dressing in the container. 3rd strike, I ordered the Pasta with Chicken in Scampi sauce, and the ingredients that are suppose to be in it are missing. I got dry noodles and some chicken chunks, that's it, no veggies at all... 3 strikes, you're out! This restaurant is consumed with incompetence."
Iara C.,"Buffalo, NY",0,2,,3.0,11/9/2015,"Me and my boyfriend went there because we were craving for some cheesecake and we'd never been to a Cheesecake Factory before. The place was nice, a little fancier than we thought it would be, with a lot of room and when we went (around 6pm) it wasn't full yet. We asked for two pieces of cheesecake and a double espresso. It really took sometime to get the cheesecakes and the espresso was cold when it arrived at our table. We had to wait sometime until the waitress came to our table again so we could ask for a hot espresso. The cheesecakes were really good, though. And the pieces were really generous."
Marisol A.,"Philadelphia, PA",1,14,1,4.0,8/8/2015,"So finally had Cheesecake Factory it was good, I had the 4 cheese penne and fried mac and cheese. The penne could of had a little more taste but overall good. On the other hand the fried mac was soo good. The atmosphere was pretty chill, I went on a Thursday. My waitress was really giggly lol like a lot. I didn't have enough room for any actual cheesecake. Maybe next time I will make sure to write a review. Defiantly will come again to try more things."
Reader H.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,22,2,3.0,7/16/2015,"six of us dined here yesterday.the food was average/good.presentation was nice. issues with waiting. ..and waiting....and waiting for food. its one thing to enjoy a leisurely meal but our wait bordered on insanity. the server was a bit too perky but didnt hover. love that bread they serve ,all crunchy and delicious. upgrade from breadsticks definitely.  desserts are pure heaven, even a bowl of strawberries  (7 smackers mind you ) were served in a really nice way... but be prepared to wait..and wait"
Resplendent R.,"Philadelphia, PA",190,2,,2.0,10/15/2015,"No greeting. Waited 20 minutes for service and water. We said we both had gluten allergies and a few minutes later, waitress comes back with our water and a bread basket. We quickly said ""no we can't have bread!"" Also, servers were standing near our tables, on their phones, cursing and being completely unprofessional. Burger came out without a gluten free bun (as advertised) and they ran out without letting us know. Only bright side is the manager came over at the end and sincerely apologized, paid for our entire meal, and gave us free gluten free cheesecake."
Richard Y.,"Lansdowne, PA",52,10,,5.0,8/11/2015,The place was hot the lights the people the servers were nice and a server took my order i was not even in his sec i love this spot def going back.
Rai M.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,4,,1.0,11/6/2016,"My experience at this Cheesecake Factory was probably one of the worst experiences I have ever had at a restaurant. I was meeting some friends who were already there when I left my house. An hour later when I arrived they had still not received their food. I decided to just order a drink and avoid the long wait. The waitress, Kendra was curt and neglectful. It took my friends 20 minutes just to get the sauces they had asked for when they originally ordered. It did not end there however, Kendra then LOST my credit card when we paid.  Instead of trying to locate it, she continued with what she was doing. I asked for the manager, Peter who was just as if not more apathetic. ""Yeah..uh sorry, can't find it."" I told him this was ridiculous and his only response was ""well we won't charge you for the drink"". Well obviously not because I no longer have a credit card. He comped my friends meals but I have never been so furious at someone's lack of customer service skills. The only other thing he could give me was a post it note with the corporate 1 800 number. Ridiculous."
Amit J.,"San Jose, CA",0,1,,4.0,4/27/2016,"I am not very fond of collecting memories but this one guy at Cheesecake Factory at Walnut Street would probably remain in my memories for some time. Excellent food is one thing but the way Jonathan helped us celebrate our son's birthday lunch was a memory that would last for some good time. I am going back soon just to enjoy the pleasure of being served by this one guy, Jonathan. Thanks Jonathan."
Lizette E.,"Philadelphia, PA",67,5,,1.0,2/7/2016,"Worst Cheesecake Factory experience ever! Service was slow (even though it was empty), the quality of the food was horrible, and the manager was nonchalant and rude. To top it off, the manager still tried to charge me for uneaten food and up-charged me for 2 kids drinks (charged me the price of adult drinks). Needless to say I will never be back!"
Nora W.,"Philadelphia, PA",107,50,,3.0,9/22/2015,"I go to all of the locations in the Pa area even Cherry hill. Came in for lunch 11:30 am Sept 21,2015 Always go at lunch if you want the best service and price on lunch specials . They burned my miso salmon it had a burned look and taste. But guess what I love burned food. So I did not care,but this would piss off anyone else. I only buy miso salmon for over five years .Im a miso salmon whore."
Eric B.,"Oviedo, Orlando, FL",0,9,1,2.0,12/27/2015,"The food and atmosphere was decent but they screwed my check up and charged my card multiple times. After probably 15 minutes of trying to get it fixed, I'm pretty sure that I'm still screwed, but didn't want to devote anymore time to the ordeal."
Dama J.,"Philadelphia, PA",7,31,,2.0,2/2/2016,"I was weary of dining here after reading all the bad yelp reviews but me and my boyfriend came here to use a gift card. When we first sat down we overheard a group of waiters talking to each other confused on who was supposed to be our server. Mind you, the place was extremely empty upon arrival for lunch. We go the samosa's appetizer, which were pretty good but super greasy and seemed like something from the frozen isle of the grocery store. I had a salad that tasted like a hoagie....had lunch meat in it that was supposed to be ""grilled chicken""....oil, vinegar, and oregano on it. Tasted really bad so i swopped it and modified the hell out of the chopped salad which tasted a lot better. Boyfriend got taco's that he didn't like but was too polite to swop it out like I did. No water or drinks came to the table until asking a bunch of times. When it was time to use our gift card, boyfriend showed his phone to the waitress thinking she would copy down the short amount of info onto paper, but no....she tries to take his phone and says ""I will be back "" we had to force her to write it down so she wouldn't wander off for god knows how long. Thought that was weird.  The only good thing about this place that i can agree the other yelpers about...is that the inside looks nice. And the keylime cheesecake was very good...probably the best thing on the menu."
haralambos t.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,6,2,1.0,8/4/2015,"So I was there last night for some late night dinner and it will be my last. We walked in 10 30 and none came to greed us nor give us water. Apparently none gave a $hit Bc the kitchen closes at 11 and they waited until 10 57 to come tell us that they were closed. Manager couldn't give less of $hit bc he walked up on us after a lil conversation with the waiters, and told us "" look people want to go home"". If u are looking somewhere to eat and it happens for u to be around there at 10 30, do your self a favor and drive to the nearest diner."
Ermine B.,"Breezy Point, NY",3,3,,2.0,1/17/2016,I've eaten at cheesecake factory's in 5 states never disappointed except for this one. Ordered crabs cake came out room temperature second time they came out cold waitress apologized  said did I want dessert because she felt bad. Ordered dessert and was charged. The manager was no where to be seen
Autumn Y.,"Addison, TX",1,18,11,1.0,1/17/2016,"Beautiful setting, but absolutely terrible service even after asking for a manager to bring it to his attention. Food was cold, mimosas were warm & full of OJ, not coming back to this location. Sat around dirty plates for 4ever waiting on check. Not even a busy day"
Jessica C.,"Philadelphia, PA",167,18,,3.0,10/11/2015,My boyfriend wanted to come and randomly get dessert and of course I was all for it! We came to get his favorite apple crispers and I ordered the cookies dough cheesecake ! The dessert and presentation was great! If the service was as great as the food I would've given 5 stars hands down. Unfortunately we did not get any silver wear or plates for the bread... Also I didn't get a refill on my drink until we were ready to leave and pay. I know all the servers are not this way because the table beside us was lucky enough to get a server that actually seemed to like their job. If the waitress was more enthusiastic and on top of it this would've been a great experience... Maybe next time we will get the cool guy with the mohawk that served the table next to us!
