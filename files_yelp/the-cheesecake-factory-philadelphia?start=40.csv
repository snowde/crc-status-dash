Priya S.,"Philadelphia, PA",41,74,69,3.0,4/6/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory is a decent place because you can get pretty much anything you want. From orange chicken to salmon. I would say that there salmon is amazing and is great quality. My only downside of this place is the health factor, but they do have a skinny menu. As Drake says, it is a good place for families."

David C.,"Oceanside, CA",149,2,,3.0,9/17/2017,"This was a typical Cheesecake Factory of which I am a big fan of. My wife and I looked up this one because we were starving and it was the closest and about the last restaurant open around midnight( they closed at 1230). We called ahead to see if it would be an issue with us coming at midnight and the person whom we spoke to said that it was no problem. Once we got seated our server immediately started rushing us to order our food. He also told us that he had been there all day and they were so busy that they didn't have anymore bread( that was ok). Throughout the entire experience we were rushed and the server was trying to get us out of there so quickly he forget a few things that we asked for. As I mentioned in the beginning of this review, I am a fan of TCF( The Cheesecake Factory) but don't go to this one 30 mins before they close even if they say it's ok when you call lol."
Alisha S.,"Philadelphia, PA",250,197,830,5.0,8/2/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory never fails to disappoint. It is for sure my favorite chain restaurant. This time I tried the Chocolate Hazelnut Crunch Cheesecake topped with Nutella that just debuted on July 29th. It was incredible! I hope it's here to stay.  In regards to this location in particular, the building and atmosphere is stunning!!!"
Mike F.,"Reading, PA",86,146,351,3.0,11/5/2015,"Whenever I think of the Cheesecake Factory, Vince Young always comes to mind. As his dumpster fire of an NFL career was coming to an end circa 2012, reports began to surface that the former Eagles QB and third overall pick of the 2006 NFL draft was known to spend upwards of $5,000 per week at the Cheesecake Factory. I know NFL players enjoy the lavish lifestyle, but come on, $5,000 per week at the CHEESECAKE FACTORY? You're a millionaire. Treat yourself. That's like if I went out tonight and spent $200 at Taco Bell (I've come close).  Sources now say Vince Young is now working at an undisclosed Cheesecake Factory location as a short order line cook. Get 'em, Vince! This was my first visit to a Cheesecake Factory. Not sure how I was able to avoid them for this long. You know, there's a lot to like about this place. The dining room is pretty darn impressive. Lots of head room.  Pressed for time, my buddies and I opted to sit at the bar rather than wait for a table. Service was friendly, though not the most attentive. As a fairly outgoing group, we were able to get the attention of the bartenders. But I noticed a lot of quiet couples around us being completely neglected. This was actually making ME feel a little awkward, so I made it a point to tell the bartender not to focus solely on my group and to help the other people standing around. Not sure why this was necessary ... you'd think they would do this on their own. Food portions are HUGE! Has anyone else ever ordered the chicken fingers here? You seriously get like two pounds of chicken and another half pound of mashed potatoes. Seriously. It's obscene. In a good way, of course. Would I come back? Sure. I love riding escalators to the main dining room. I don't get to do that much here in Reading. Weeeeee!"
Jess D.,"Los Angeles, CA",165,358,98,2.0,6/5/2016,"This was probably the worst Cheesecake Factory I have ever been to. The service was terrible, they brought us the wrong dish and then argued with us when we tried to explain why it's the wrong dish and whah ingredients were missing. The salad had chunks of bad romaine in it which was disappointing. That being said, the food was still good but definitely not up to Cheesecake Factory standards. It's a shame because the location is ideal and the decor and layout are very pretty."
Jia Yi S.,"Singapore, Singapore",0,3,2,4.0,10/29/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory was AMAZING, but pricey. Not everything was good, but if you order the right things, it'd be a perfect meal. The portions were huge as well. If you're an average eater, one entree is good enough for two.  Four of us had 1 appetizer and 3 entrées, 2 cheesecakes and 1 ice cream. The bill came up to 100. Just to let you know. Service was great, though food came a little slow. Still. Food was food. No complaints.  Orders:  Calamari - was salty, though with a nice crisp. Still not worth it Bang Bang chicken and shrimp - distinct Thai flavor with pineapple. Great great dish if you love Thai.  Steak Diane - amazing. Very well done. Had a medium rare. Mushrooms were perfect.  Some sort of deep fried chicken pasta - very average, even possibly below average.  Smores cheesecake - Fantastic, if you love Smores or chocolate. Red velvet - average, nothing outstanding Hot fudge sundae - below average, was meh."
Kevin J.,"Philadelphia, PA",142,64,84,4.0,8/13/2016,"This is a cheesecake factory review for their dessert because imo that's what sets them apart!!  Although cheesecake is in the name, I would say the sundaes are a slightly better dessert option on the menu! I have never been disappointed in a cheesecake from here but I have also never been stuffed. If you want to have a large dessert to share, I would suggest the hot fudge or rocky road sundae. It's large enough for 2-3 people and if you ask for no whipped cream I'm almost positive you get more ice cream haha."
Jason C.,"Philadelphia, PA",249,43,10,1.0,2/24/2017,"Date night. Normally we love cheesecake factory but everything that could go wrong with this trip did.  It starts with not being brought water for the longest, then we didn't get our order taken for a very long time.  We started our order with the Buffalo Blast appetizer, which NEVER came. The drink my partner ordered took about 20 minutes to show up.  Our main dishes were the truffle honey chicken which had good flavor but was 90% breading and the bang bang chicken and shrimp for which my partner asked for extra sauce and received only when his dish was half gone, and then it was the wrong sauce.  Our waiter (Daveanghn) made little attempt to explain or correct any of the wait times or errors. While they were busy, he only had 4 or 5 tables in our section, so we were baffled by the lack of service.  This coupled with a few questionable lunch experiences (my office is right near the walnut st location) probably means we won't be returning to this location. We were too dissappinted to even stick around for cheesecake this time around! :("
Kate S.,"Wyncote, PA",0,5,,2.0,3/1/2017,"It's a shame, I love the food here. But this past weekend makes my 3rd trip to this location and the service is just fecal. Waited for an insane amount of time for a drink AT THE BAR while we waited for our table. Our eventual server this time was actually terrific, I wish I remembered his name. But the rest of the experience was at best mediocre. And the food just took for fargling ever to come out. And it's never even busy enough to justify the slow service.  Also it's always super warm in there, maybe turn your AC on? It's Rittenhouse Square for Pete's sake, pick your game up a little."
Sari A.,"Philadelphia, PA",1200,862,11026,2.0,8/6/2015,"At Cheesecake Factory... And I keep asking myself, why I'm here? and why anyone would want to come here.  If you are planning on going, I've got you covered: - Grumpy, unsmiling staff, including the host! - inattentive , slow, and totally uninformed waitress. P.s: she was friendly thou. - No prices on cocktail menu.  - Dirty silverware!!! - Mediocre mango key lime cheesecake. - I don't understand why it was so difficult to split the check.  One and half Yelps is two generous!"
Camar S.,"Philadelphia, PA",41,86,89,5.0,11/5/2016,"Ever since I was little, Cheesecake was the place to go to bond with family over amazing food. Every person you bring can find something they'll love on the menu. ALWAYS consistent with their food. ALWAYS amazing ambiance. This location is HUGE for the center city location. I loveeeeeee you Cheesecake Factory."
Leah E.,"Honolulu, HI",176,216,1282,5.0,6/29/2015,"This location opened on Tuesday... As in they haven't even been opened for a week and you can tell!!! The wait staff is in a frenzy, everything is slow as hell to come out of the kitchen and bar. But in all fairness, I'm used to dining at the Cheesecake Factory in Waikiki (which is the second busiest location behind Vegas) and they have everything down to a science.  The reason why I didn't rate Cheesecake Factory Philly 4 stars is because there is a learning curve that's happening right now and the presentation of the food was completely impressive. Like I said, I go to Cheesecake Factory often and I'm very familiar with the presentation, but now I know what it's supposed to look like!  This is the absolute best place to go in a group! There is something for everyone!!!"
Monkichi M.,"Philadelphia, PA",13,4,3,1.0,3/4/2017,"This is our second times in here this time me and my friend choose specialty fillet mignon, its a disappointment cause the more we eat it the more we feel the salt, they put too much salt on our steak. The beef is tender, it just too salty."
Jess J.,"Cherry Hill, NJ",148,204,509,4.0,3/21/2016,"I came here on a Saturday afternoon with a fairly big party of mainly teenage girls. They were done rehearsals and gearing up for a performance in a few hours. Cheesecake Factory with their large menu and portions is a good pick because everyone can find something they like... Since it was lunch time we could order the lunch portions and go easy on the pockets.  I'd never been to this location.. So one thing I will say is coming in and seeing the hostess stand on the first floor with no one standing there threw us off a bit, sent one of the girls up on the elevator and she ushered us to come up... As we rode up, we saw the hustle a bustle that is Cheesecake Factory. They didn't at all seem annoyed or flustered when we told them party of 10... Within about 10 minutes we were seated. We had one waitress that took care of us.. I like that a lot better than having 2 for either side of the table, and she did an awesome job keeping everything straight. We all pretty much knew what we wanted since we needed time for food to digest and settle prior to show time that was one of the requirements, lol know what u want and no dessert. I hated the no dessert rule after all it was Cheesecake Factory, but hey the food was filling.  I ordered the salmon off of the gluten free menu, swapped the broccoli for asparagus, so glad I made that choice, I must say some of the best asparagus I've had in a long time. The meal as a whole was considerably better than any of the cheesecake factory's I have been to. There is one 5 minutes from me that I usually end up at, but this one put them to shame. I'm definitely a fan, I usually end up here for convenience rather than choice, but this location is awesome. There was a slight mishap where when two of the girls ordered pasta with red sauce they were asked if they wanted tomatoes, so given the choice they said no, but it came out with tomatoes, when they questioned it, our waitress took it back but then came back saying that's just how it comes.. She apologized, knowing she had asked them, the girls were fine, pushed them to the side and still enjoyed the meal, overall it was a great meal, everyone enjoyed, it wasn't dragged out or we weren't rushed, it was a success!"
Joanna C.,"New York, NY",130,19,37,1.0,9/29/2017,"Came here with my coworker tonight and the food was badly prepared. There was 5 of us and 4 of us ordered the ribeye. We asked for one well done, one medium rare, and 2 medium. The well done one came out burnt my coworker kept saying it taste bitter because of the burnt charcoal on the steak. My husband medium and other coworker was both well done. My coworker didn't mind but we had to send my husband steak back. There is no way I'm paying $30 for a steak not done the way I want it. My medium rare, came medium, no pink at all. It was late, around 12am, if it was any other time I would definitely send all four plates back to the kitchen. They need to hire new cooks or train their staff better on how to prepare steak. And my husband didn't even get his second steak because the manager came over and said it was the last piece of steak in the house. He didn't even seem apologetic or anything. And when we decide to change my husband entree to a pasta dish. When I asked the manager if he could not charge us for the steak and charge us for the pasta instead he seemed annoyed. As if we were in the wrong. I won't be returning to this location any time soon after tonight's experience, $200 on crappy food."
Robin H.,"Naples, FL",0,10,,1.0,10/12/2016,"Our server was friendly. That's the best thing i can say about our experience tonight.  We waited an extremely long time to be served dinner salads and when the salads were finally delivered only 4 of the 5 were correct.  So the 5th one was sent back and our friend was told that waited (she didn't even have an appetite anymore)   hers to finally be served, after the rest of us were basically finished ours.  The table next to us arrived after we did, were served their hot dinners and were eating by the time we had called over the manager to complain on the missing salad. The kitchen was unable to create a simple timely salad There were just 5 of us dining tonight. Manager comped the completed5th salad. Nothing else was done by the manager to leave us satisfied with this dining experience.  Don't waste your TIME and $."
Patty V.,"Cherry Hill, NJ",8,105,130,4.0,5/26/2016,"I've been to this Cheesecake Factory three times so far and have good good experiences each time.  Good food, nice sized portions, fairly friendly and attentive service.  Best of all, shockingly, both times I came for lunch it wasn't crowded at all.  At many Cheesecake Factory restaurants, it's packed to the gills no matter what day or time you go and often there is a long wait.  Not at this location - at least not the 3 times I went so far.  I guess there are many more options in the city to choose from.  Either that, or Cheesecake Factory appeals more to suburbanites than city folk.  At any rate, I've been happy each time I have gone and the food and service are comparable to my hometown CF in Cherry Hill, NJ. BTW, my favorite things to order are the fried mac & cheese, the avocado egg rolls, the Bistro Shrimp pasta and for dessert, the strawberry shortcake, which is a biscuit-type shortcake with vanilla ice cream, strawberries and whipped cream.  Note:  it's HUGE and feeds 3 people easily."
Robert G.,"Philadelphia, PA",124,57,,4.0,10/22/2016,I love the complimentary warm bread served at the beginning. The greek salad is good! I also liked the white chicken chili off the Skinnylicious menu. Original and smores cheesecake are A+
MusicLover J.,"BOWLING GREEN, NY",1,12,21,4.0,7/22/2017,We came very early in order to beat the crowd and wait. Happy hour had just started and we pretty much had the place to ourselves. We sat in the bar area and ordered fried mac n cheese and the avocado spring rolls. Both were absolutely amazing. We got the spring rolls with honey mustard instead. The service was fast. The only thing was the tomato sauce for the mac n cheese was slightly cold. They must have put that on the plate first while waiting for the mac n cheese to cook.
