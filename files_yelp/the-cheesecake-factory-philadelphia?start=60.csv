Caren J.,"Philadelphia, PA",35,58,5,3.0,6/14/2017,"I've been here a few times with no issues at all. But yesterday I went with 6 of my coworkers for a going away lunch and it took 2 hours. It was sooo slow, and the restaurant is never busy.  Then randomly my husband took me tonight on a whim and the service was soooo slow and again, it was empty.  Food is good, servers are always nice but the food comes out slow."
Steph M.,"Mount Laurel, NJ",23,20,,1.0,9/25/2017,2nd time here in the last few weeks and both visits not good. Last time the slowest server and bad meals and missing ingredients. Had  it a try again because it use to be good. Salad missing ingredients and barely any dressing. Won't be going back!
Laura S.,"Houston, TX",0,8,10,1.0,9/20/2016,Gross. I'm not a germaphobe but they need a new dish washer. My first glass of water was sticky and had food flake off and then I ordered some and it came with big red lipstick marks. The service was terrible and then annoying. We'd ask for a menu or a side of dressing and it'd take 20 min but while my friend were clearly in conversation catching up our server kept budding in awkwardly. The cheesecake was good but that's about it.
Joe P.,"Philadelphia, PA",259,33,,3.0,6/1/2017,"If you're looking for a calorie dump straight to the midsection, go here. I LOVE the food, and the dessert is obviously great."
Hala A.,"London, United Kingdom",0,4,3,1.0,9/27/2017,I ordered to go and sat on the bench waiting to be called for 20 min... and then since no one called me i asked the togo worker and he said i called u i was like in this noisy restaurant it is impossible to hear since i an sitting on the bench and not standing next to the cashier... he is supposed to come to with the food he saw yet even when I didn't hear he did not bring the food to me I could have waited for 20 more minutes
Punky T.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,3,,1.0,6/7/2017,"After our third visit here, we will not be returning. Promptly seated, we waited 13 minutes for any server to take our drink order. A party (seated after) next to us had their drinks before we met our server. After waiting another 15 minutes 2 of 3 of our drinks arrived. Because ""the bar was running behind"".  Our server also insisted there were no more kids cups. The same table across from us had one though. I ordered the Bang Bang Chicken wich had no Bang at all. Not a hint of spice. Wife ordered the Jamaican chicken which was just as lack luster. My daughter had spaghetti and marinara and surprise.. She likes it from our neighborhood diner more. I would only recomend cheesecake to go, if that."
Phillip S.,"Silver Spring, MD",0,11,,1.0,11/23/2017,"Wednesday before thanksgiving 2017 and I have to work in DC so I go to visit my mother and the Cheesecake Factory is a safe bet. Walking in and seating is quick and the waiter asks for drinks. It's cold out so 2 waters 2 coffees. 12-15 minutes later no coffee or water and says he was backed up. 5 seconds later we walk out. I talked to the manager and left. I have worked in the restaurant industry for James beard awarded chefs, French culinary chefs with notable companies such as the kimpton as a sommelier certified from the CMS or as a restaurant manager. I have a lot of latitude when it comes to service or food to a degree but this is the first time the cheesecake has let me down. Dc tysons palm beach gardens etc. cheesecake has always been consistent except tonight. Note I blame none of the other staff, the manager was empathetic, the hostesses were properly dressed and diligent it was just the server and his lapse or lack of care. I plan on returning on my next visit from dc."
Salima C.,"Philadelphia, PA",282,103,54,1.0,6/23/2016,"I DESPISE chain restaurants. It's definitely not my first choice but on a pouring rainy day semi tired from work we settled on something quick and easy...so we thought.  Shrimp Alfredo- shrimp was dry and chewy, Alfredo pasta was season less, it's really hard to mess up a dish that's typically good if you just dump sauce on it but Cheesecake Factory center city found a way to make it bland and not very enjoyable. Filet mignon and cheese balls-wanted to swap out one of the sides that came w/ the steak for the cheese balls and simply add the extra cost  (if necessary) since cheese balls are $10 and the sides are $5. They made such a huge deal about it. I even suggested they comp the cheese balls just to accommodate us as paying customers and that was empathically denied. Our waiter Christian was kinda cool but had NO power or willingness. The manager Manny was incompetent and rigid. I even said to him, ""Manny you aren't very good at your job are you?"" Lol  They didn't bring a steak knife for my friend to eat the steak with. They ran out of Riesling and the their Mojito was gross, had to send it back and just got Gingerale which was $3.00 and NO refills.  The entire experience was blah and reminded me why I'm so picky about the places I choose to dine. Never again will I allow anyone to make me feel guilty for being a dining snob. I'll simply remind them of this experience and hopefully they get it...if not...ill be far away at Devon or Parc and I won't hear their judging."
Lindsey B.,"Bustleton, Philadelphia, PA",7,60,78,1.0,1/17/2017,"Came in at a not busy time 4:45 on a Monday, not only did no one come over after ten minutes but after saying something to the hostess I was still left sitting. I got up and left only to find the escalator now broken going down. I wanted my friend who had never been to try and no I doubt he ever will."
Tori P.,"Philadelphia, PA",58,15,,2.0,9/14/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory has always had solid food. I've never been disappointed in the quality or taste of my food. But at all of the other locations, the delicious food came with efficient service, knowledgeable servers, and overall great experience. This has not been the case in the Center City location. I have been there a few times, and always been disappointed and stressed by the length of the wait. Today's instance was particularly obnoxious. I went with a group of 15 for a work lunch. We did expect it to take more than an hour, but we certainly weren't expecting it to take almost two and a half hours.  Food orders weren't taken until we had been waiting for 30 minutes. We weren't all served for another 45. Then onto dessert, which didn't fully come out until about 30 minutes after they had cleared our entrees.  I would definitely recommend this place unless you have an absurd amount of time to spend here."
Carly M.,"New York, NY",0,3,2,1.0,1/1/2017,This place is a nightmare. It took us 43 minutes to order our entrees. An hour later - still no food. R u trying to kill me? Once the food comes out our waitress is nowhere to be seen meanwhile I'm choking down spicy hot pasta with 0 liquids. The entire process took about 2 hours and 40 minutes. I'm very upset.
Sophia H.,"Washington, DC",261,334,14,3.0,2/19/2016,"Very fancy decor. Food was okay. We got the oreo cheesecake, which was great. I'm not a big fan of cheesecakes, but the oreo was pretty good compared to the others I've had.  Extravagant, dim-lit restaurants (or cheesecakes) are just not for me though. It'd be a good spot for special occasions or dates, but i think it's rather overrated."
Brooke D.,"Philadelphia, PA",109,4,2,5.0,3/2/2017,Leanna was SUCH a great server I've been to the Cheesecake Factory many times before but my experience this time was phenomenal!! Food was great as usual. I would suggest the stuffed mushrooms
Rinn F.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,1,,1.0,8/17/2017,"Went here for my birthday celebration with two friends. Not only did they wish Happy Birthday to the wrong person, the food was less than lackluster and a server shushed us for being too ""loud."" The food runner looked at me sheepishly as he realized he sang happy birthday to the wrong individual and apologized before making his quick escape. That same server that shushed my table was also complaining about working at The Cheesecake Factory - saying that she was working for longer than she was supposed to. Would not recommend going there. Nothing but disappointment. The branch at the King of Prussia Mall is a much better franchise."
Barbara B.,"Jamaica, NY",0,18,22,5.0,2/18/2017,"Not sure this place needs a review. Amazing selection, huge portions, great service. I can't think of any negative thing to say."
Sagar P.,"Philadelphia, PA",260,10,2,4.0,9/7/2015,"This is probably one of my favorite big chain restaurants, and the Philly location did not let me down. It has a great spot with views of the city which makes it a step above the average Cheesecake Factory at the mall. Overall the food is great. The menu can be overwhelming for some since it literally is a 20 page book, but it is filled with a great variety. There is literally something for everyone. There were plenty of vegetarians options, and portions are huge! Don't forget to save room for cheesecake though. Having tried at least 10 different cheesecakes they have, I have never been disappointed. Strangely they seated our party of 5 on a table for 4 and then seated a party of 2 in a large booth for 5/6 people. Maybe they are still working out things since they are still relatively new, but this was really inconvenient. Also, service can be slow since the waiters have lots of tables and literally have to run around to keep up.  Overall, the food was great, and there is so much more to try so I will be going back."
Jihee K.,"SUNNYSIDE, NY",4,4,,1.0,12/13/2016,"""TERRIBLE SERVICE!!!!!!!!!!!"" I went there twice once with my b.f and once with my sister. When I went to with my bf, it was around 5pm and there was almost no ppl but it took at least 20 mins to order the food.  And last weekend, I went there with my sister around 3pm. And we waited 20 mins to get sits and it took 10 mins to order. And the server told us to bring the bread and she didn't bring us anything and I asked her again for bread and she ignored us and she was just chatting with her co-workers. So eventually, we didn't get anything to eat for 50 mins once we got there. When I left there without eating anything, she did say one thing ""Sorry"". I will never go back to that place again. It  really messed up my day."
Alaysia B.,"Olney-Oak Lane, Philadelphia, PA",0,12,,1.0,3/1/2017,"Horrible, horrible, horrible place. The food is amazing, but the service is incredibly poor. I always sit at the bar and I constantly get bad service. They inattentive and they have bad attitudes."
Jennifer B.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,19,1,2.0,5/12/2016,"We came here for lunch today. The lettus wraps were served with wilted brown lettus, after we asked for fresh lettus we were brought a mix of fresh and wilted. The chicken it came with had skin on pieces which wasn't appealing. The chicken was also difficult to cut. The fresh vegetable salad was mostly lettus. We've ordered both dishes at other franchises and had much better experiences. The waiter was nice but we are currently still waiting to overpay for our rather disappointing lunch. We will not return to this location."
