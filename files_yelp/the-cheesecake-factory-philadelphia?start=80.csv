Kirk S.,"Philadelphia, PA",6,13,30,5.0,8/26/2016,"I have written other reviews regarding the regular dining menu at TCF. this review is strictly about the happy hour menu offered between 4 and 6PM Monday thru Friday. I have gone once by myself around Five PM and it was very busy but my experience was very good. had to wait a bit for drinks sometimes but considering thre rush the delay was understandable. This time i went with a friend and we showed up right after Four PM. Big difference in the room. Not nearly as busy or loud. I'll just list the items that we ordered along with their happy hour price-Chicken Pot Stickers ($5.50), Crispy Crab Bites ($7.50,real crab meat), The Warm Crab & Artichoke Dip ($5.50-had two orders in house and my friend ordered one to go, that's how great the dip is. Intoxicating and addictive!), Dynamite Tempura Shrimp ($6.95-not as spicy as I had been led to think they would be but good flavor nonetheless. If you order the house wine, be it white, red, or zinfandel, (I had my usual Merlot) the price is $5.50. Name brand wines will cost more (Like my friend's Moscato @ $9.50). You can get beer for $3-4 and drinks such as Long Island Iced teas, mojitos, and margaritas for $5.50! There are so many appetizers that we didn't get to try this time nut are looking forward to on our next trip. The price is right and the earlier you come the better the service will be. After five it can get busy so things will take longer. Wanted to also mention our server Craig M. who answered our questions and, if didn't know the answer, he would go and find out. He was friendly and patient, even bringing us fresh, warm bread when the first basket came out cold and hard. Thanks Craig!  So, if you are looking to try The Cheesecake Menu without paying the regular prices, try their happy hour. You will probably be tempted into going back to try the regular menu at some point in the future."
Jenny Z.,"Philadelphia, PA",4,17,,4.0,7/11/2017,"Good inexpensive place to eat for less than $20 per person. It's right in the middle of center city, so it's classy without being too expensive."
Kiki S.,"Fort Washington, MD",22,11,4,2.0,12/22/2016,Not a happy camper right now. I called in over a half hour ago to make a reservation and was told that a reservation was not needed for our party of 8... That a table would be available. Guess who's still waiting? They're only getting two stars because the food was good during my last visit.
Jessie H.,"Manhattan, NY",276,928,650,3.0,7/13/2015,This location just recently opened so I think they're still sorting out everything. I got the chicken pasta carbonara and my friend got the santa fe salad. She asked for her salad dressing to be on the side but they mixed it in. The waitress was really nice about it and got her another one but it took awhile. From the time we sat down to the time we left it was a good 2.5-3 hours.  Location- 5/5 Excellent decor and location is right in the middle of center city on 15th and Walnut Food- 3/5 Average cheesecake factory food Service- 3/5 They're super busy and the food took awhile to come out If you come here just remember to factor in time....
Shannon R.,"Philadelphia, PA",133,14,,2.0,7/26/2016,"This was my 1st time at this location.  The building and atmosphere is gorgeous.  Thankfully they have an elevator in addition to the escalators and steps.  I was with a rather large group of people, and we were able to be seated in a private room with a wonderful view of Philadelphia.  This was good and bad.  Why?  As it got darker outside, the dimmer the lights became on the inside, to the point where we were all pulling out our cellphones to use the lights to read our menus!  For my drink, I ordered a glass of Moscato.  Unfortunately they were out of it. :(  So, I ordered a glass of Riesling.  It was pretty good.  The only thing i didn't like was the fact that the wine glasses were so large, yet they only filled it up halfway!  I guess that's to make you order another glass.  Who knows.  Needless to say, for $9.50, that was my only glass of wine for the night.  Grade: B My appetizer was the Fried Zucchini.  I asked for mine without cheese and marinara sauce instead of ranch dressing.  I was looking forward to it, since this is one of my favorite appetizers in the world, and everywhere I have gone either took it off of their menus or it has been absolutely horrendous!  Well...The Cheesecake factory made me happy!  Thick pieces of Zucchini sticks, light and crispy breading and wasn't served as a greasy mess!  The people I shared them with agreed that they were very good.  The portion was very large.  I ended up ordering more to go with my main course.  Grade: A+ My main course for dinner was Fish and Chips.  Well.  I can honestly say that I've had better in less-costing restaurants.  The flsh was fried nice and crispy, but it was very bland.  The fries were good.  Grade: C Dessert:  I ordered the Oreo Cookie Cheesecake for myself and the Godiva Cheesecake for my friend.  Both were awesome, like always!  Grade: A+ The only thing that I can completely say that I was truly upset about was the salad that I ordered to-go.  It was the French Country Salad with mixed greens, grilled asparagus, fresh beets, goat cheese, candied pecans and vinaigrette.  I was very disappointed when I got home and opened up the salad.  Extremely wilted lettuce.  There were only a couple pieces of beets and they looked dried out.  We won't even talk about the asparagus.  About 2 goat cheese crumbles.  All I can say is that this was a major disappointment for the amount that it cost. Grade:D Overall, my experience with the food was ok.  Our server, Anna, did a good job with serving a large group.  The only issue I had was sending my check back for corrections.   Will I go back to this particular location?  Not sure.  We shall see.    Overall Grade:  C"
Alli M.,"Philadelphia, PA",1,40,40,2.0,10/27/2016,"The food is very good and consistent. Friendly table service. Portions are large even at Happy hour  - a great deal. Nice pours. However I'm rating the service at the bar horrible. I've been numerous times and I swear the bar tenders are trained NOT to acknowledge customers, Not to ask if they would like water or drink refills. Bummed out because I like the CCF."
Ren N.,"Denver, CO",193,246,1421,4.0,9/5/2015,"Beautiful place for a lavish dinner. The menu is cheese cake factory, the feeling you get when you come here really accentuates the dining experience. The menu has been updated with newer items I have never seen before. My favorite go to of all time is Thai lettuce wrap, you can't go wrong with a plate of healthy veggies along with some chicken. Service is overall friendly and the view when given at certain seating locations is amazing. One of the best places for birthdays or anniversaries. Highly recommended"
Robert P.,"Philadelphia, PA",1,3,7,4.0,7/14/2017,always have had a great meal here and the wait staff has been excellent. it's a beautiful place. one of the better cheesecake factories in the area.
Esha C.,"Philadelphia, PA",7,19,8,5.0,3/1/2016,"Been here twice, once for happy and once for lunch. My waitress was efficient and friendly. The food was soooooo good. My mother and I had the buffalo blasts as an appetizer. They are so good, highly recommended. Tastes like they were made from scratch. For the main course I had the chicken and shrimp gumbo while my mother had some type of chicken Alfredo. I ordered a passion fruit mojito, a little too fruity, it made my stomach hurt. Then finally for desert I had the snickers cheesecake. Omg it was so good. Everything was so good. Although it was crowded when we went, we didn't wait that long for food. Their menu is a little price so expect to spend at least $75-100.  Can't wait to go back"
Wise M.,"Haymarket, VA",20,42,146,4.0,11/7/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory. If you been to one then you literally been to them all.  I mean you're here for cheesecake right? Oh, you actually like the food. The food is ok. Although, I had the Jamaican dish and the was worth wild to mention. So, the next time you're there order the dish and tell your server Wise recommended that meal. Btw, I left without getting cheesecake."
Birdy A.,"Willow Grove, PA",8,33,7,2.0,10/11/2016,"overly phony wait staff, ridiculous menu.... good veggie burgers and a few other items , salads average...good coffee ... been here to this location several times.."
Huy L.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,4,4,3.0,12/5/2016,"First star is for the decoration. This location is for young people who cannot drive to other locations. Second star is for the service. Nice and friendly. Third star is for cheese cake. Should try the mango key lime one. Beautiful cake comes with multiple layer of flavors, tastes, and textures. Minus 2 stars because the grilled food was horrible. I ordered KOBE Style burger with Medium cook. They handed me a burned well done and dried meat. I called the server to request a new one. My friends already finished their meals and I had to wait for my burger in 20 mins. Second time was less burn but still complete well done and dried. They use gas grill and you can smell the gas on every bite. I wanted throw up after a first bite. The sever was so nice so I just let it go and pack it home. Of course, I will throw it away. Cannot eat it. My friend's pork chop dish was $23 and it was burned as well. The burn layer was like 1/8 inches. She had to cut it out and eat it without requesting to change her dish. In general, it was overpriced for the quality of food. It looks nice but not recommended for a date because people bring their kids and it may get lousy sometime."
Karen F.,"Harleysville, PA",0,4,,3.0,12/23/2016,"Location is great, very clean and attractive restaurant. Training of staff needs work. Our waitress didn't know the salad dressings or soup and offered drink refills when we were ready for the check"
Mini S.,"Philadelphia, PA",8,9,50,3.0,3/28/2016,"Food n service was ok, great ambiance, l really like the red velvet cheese cake n crab cake but rest of the food r not really as we expect even they not season properly."
Courtney J.,"Philadelphia, PA",1,23,,2.0,10/24/2016,I am not the kind of person that is against chain restaurants and will gladly eat at a cheesecake factory even when there are other non-chain restaurants to choose from. So I've been to probably 4 other cheesecake factories in different cities and this one was definitely the worst. The shrimp in my pasta was very overcooked and the dish itself was underseasoned. I ended up taking home about 2/3rds and hooking it up myself for lunch/dinner the next day. The cheesecake was good as always though. But I am not in any hurry to come back to this location.
Jonathan L.,"Garden Grove, CA",10,37,4,1.0,7/1/2016,"This location sucks. So I ordered to go after walking half a mile from where I'm staying so I wouldn't lose my parking spot. I ordered the shrimp and angel hair, one of my favorite dishes. So when I walk all the way back and get to my food, it had no marinara sauce, about a quarter of the tomatoes that it's supposed to have, and only 4 shrimp. WTF?! I paid 20 bucks for this dish and it pretty much was only plain noodles with olive oil. I don't feel like walking another mile there and back to return this bland  joke of a meal. If you like cheesecake factory, avoid this one. It's obvious the cook here doesn't know or give a crap about putting the correct amount of ingredients in their recipes."
Adam E.,"Bensalem, PA",3,16,,1.0,11/22/2015,Just walked out of there after standing in the entrance while the greeter with the long messy blonde hair was on the phone gossiping. My party and I were confused about whether we wait for her to finish or go up the giant broken escalator. So I kindly asked if we go up because we were unattended and she was clearly trying to avoid us. Then she held her hand up and said one minute please in an aggravated tone. So after going in circles for 30 minutes trying to find parking we dont even get acknowledged when we walk in to the place. I said screw it and we walked over to Pietro's Pizza and are now enjoying an amazing personalized pizza! To the woman with the dry ends please learn some people skills.
Eric T.,"Doylestown, PA",2,16,,4.0,8/8/2016,"The service here is great! I only discovered this place was a full out restaurant a couple years ago lol and I was pleasantly surprised at how upscale it was, while also keeping it casual. I love the complementary warm bread and butter, can't go wrong with that. The portions are very large and I believe well worth the hefty prices of some. I would say most of the entrees are shareable for two light eaters. I love the chicken Madeira. The cheesecakes are unsurprisingly delicious as well. Overall, with my numerous visits here, this Cheesecake Factory delivers with quality food and quality service."
B. T.,"Philadelphia, PA",31,15,7,1.0,10/8/2016,"I ordered two burgers both well done for take out.  One was raw and the other included a hair. Memorable, but in a bad way."
Sharia W.,"Philadelphia, PA",26,49,272,1.0,11/2/2015,"I was very disappointed with this particular restaurant because it's one my favorite restaurant chains. The manager (a female) was not attentive to us when 4 out 8 people at our table was served and 2 happened to be children. She heard our compliant and never returned to let us know what was going on or to even apologized or ask us how our food turned out. By the time the food came out, the other 4 people were almost finished and the kids had to eat bread because they were so hungry. I was never treated so poorly at any other cheesecake factory before in my life. When getting the check, the manager did take off the 2 kids entrees. but I had to let our waiter know that my dad and I didn't get our burgers until everyone else was done eating. How long does it take to cook a burger??????? Like really. One positive thing, was the view. Hell, I'll take good service over view any day. Valet was pretty pricey @ $22.00 a car. I would rather stick to Cherry hill, KOP, or Willow grove's cheesecake factory. I will NEVER visit this cheesecake factory location again. My visit took place on 11-31-15"
