Brenda R.,"Phoenix, AZ",110,153,564,5.0,1/2/2018,I came here to have a Christmas dinner for work and the hostess greeted us right away and told us it would be about 20 minutes because we arrived early. She was kind enough to keep us updated on our tables and they would take us back shortly. As soon as we were taken to our table our waitress greeted us and asked for our drink selection. Considering there was 13 of us the drinks came out really fast and no mistakes. She then took all of our orders and was very friendly. I ordered the filet mignon medium with veggies and mashed potatoes. Everything was cooked exactly as i ordered and let me say i cleaned off the plate. We all then ordered cheesecake to go and they have an extensive selection on cheesecakes. That by far was the hardest part to decide which one i wanted. I really enjoyed it here and will be back to try other foods from their endless menu choices.  This location in particular can validate your parking so make sure to take your chip in with you.
Funky D.,"Phoenix, AZ",28,119,,4.0,10/9/2017,"The Factory is winning with its appetizers. They aren't cheap, but from small plates to small salads, I don't remember having an app I didn't like.  On my latest visit, I dared to try the fried Mac and Cheese balls. I kept wavering at first, because I couldn't imagine their mac and cheese tasting any different than a box of pre-packaged stuff lurking in my pantry. But whoa! The dish knocked my socks off. Can I get an AMEN for comfort? The nicely fried balls were close to 2.5 inches round with large noodles mixed with creamy cheesy goodness. I don't know what blend of cheese is used, but I was happy that I couldn't taste american cheese. And it wasn't as greasy as you would think. The mac balls are topped with a tomato-cheese dip that also taste pretty good. Four balls cost $11.95 Avocado Egg Rolls (11.95) speak for themselves and the accompanying dip speaks for everything else:  Six half rolls per dish are served on top of some useless white crunchy sticks that I ignore every time. I forgot to ask if I could substitute lettuce for them. At least then the egg rolls would be sitting on top of something pretty. Oh well, maybe I can save packing costs by using the sticks as padding for the next package I send for X-mas. Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes (10.95): I've ordered this before and wanted to try a second time. Yes, it's a comforting dish. Sweet corn kernels are baked into three tamale pancakes and covered in garnish of avocado, pico, cream, and some kind of relish (which I just realized today) tastes very similar to Thousand Island. Would I go to the Factory without ordering cheesecake? No, no I wouldn't. Ever since I had a good run with the Struessel (which they no longer carry unfortunately) I've been tasting other flavors. This time I decided on the Lemon/Raspberry, dulce de leche, and white choco/raspberry. Hmmm, I like all three."
Lauren A.,"Phoenix, AZ",14,210,135,4.0,10/7/2017,"I hadn't been here in years but it was just as good as I remember it, only a little more expensive. We met some friends here for dinner. Parking on a Friday night is a challenge but they have valet if you don't want to circle around. When we checked in we were told it would be around 15 minutes but they had us seated in about 5. Their menu is huge. Honestly, it's too big but there is something for everyone which is nice. We started with the crispy Cuban egg rolls and the stuffed garlic bread which were both excellent, the dipping sauce for the egg rolls was delicious! There was a variety of dishes from Alfredo, salads, steak Diane, another pasta dish and my orange chicken on the table and everything looked good. My orange chicken had great flavor and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The serving size was huge so I had the rest for lunch the next day. We were all stuffed but but you can't leave without trying the cheesecake. We tried the salted Carmel and a couple of milkshakes for our younger dining counterparts. The service was excellent and our servers were very friendly and helpful.  My dinner bill for 3 with an appetizer, sodas, 3 entrees, 1 piece of cheesecake and a milkshake was $93.00 before the tip. The only downside of the dinner was the restrooms. Two of the three stalls had no toilet paper."
Addy D.,"Midland, TX",1,6,29,4.0,1/5/2018,I have been to a Cheesecake Factory in Dallas but I have never gotten a pizza there . I have to say it was very good and cheesy . The cheesecake had a Nutella drizzle and a hazelnut crunch it tasted like a Ferro Roshea .
Jonathan W.,"Phoenix, AZ",16,56,29,3.0,1/5/2018,"Grabbed some cheesecake to go and well this may or may not be biased but their cheesecake just doesn't taste as good as I rememeber, that or I've just had a lot better elsewhere. Reeses was delicious but let's be real, you really cannot mess up a Reeses cheesecake... The red velvet however was extremely lacking and almost flavorless (minus the obvious super sweetness). I'm not a fan of processed food and pretty much everything that comes out of their kitchen (almost any chain restaurant) is processed. Too many gourmet scratch kitchens throughout the valley that I would prefer to support"
Norma G.,"Phoenix, AZ",113,141,1434,5.0,11/29/2017,"Stop in after running errands. Sat at the bar area, first time. Bartender name was: Ariel. Even though she was busy we had a chance to have a great conversations. She is a sweetheart! Hope to have her again serve me :)"
Evan T.,"Circle Pines, MN",0,23,3,2.0,1/8/2018,"Crispy crab bites were good, but the water tasted like swimming pool water and my enchiladas were drowning in so much sauce they were hard to eat. Just not very good overall."
Nat S.,"Phoenix, AZ",126,65,70,5.0,11/7/2017,"I love coming to the Cheesecake Factory. Food is always really good. We celebrated my sister in laws birthday and had a great dinner. Meals that were ordered included the grande burrito, eggplant parmesan, spicy chipotle chicken pasta, and spaghetti cabonara. Everyone enjoyed it! The waiter was really nice so we ended up giving the rest of our cake to the staff! We will be back again for sure!  The only cons I would say is the lighting inside (pretty dark) and the pricing is a little expensive but I'm sure people come to the restaurant knowing they are going to pay a pretty penny."
Gee L.,"Phoenix, AZ",186,463,1448,4.0,9/3/2017,"I am judging this from a HUGE CHAIN perspective, to be fair. The winner here at our meal was the fresh baked bread which seemed right out of Jersey City...the bread brought me back home. I have to think hard about the rest of our meal. I had the Asian chicken, kind of a brown sauce with lots of spice. It was okay. The salad was good. I can see why people like this place, it is large and can accommodate a million families and the dessert menu and case at the exit are quite alluring. I guess I would bring an older friend or parent here. I like better food...."
April B.,"San Diego, CA",196,51,291,4.0,11/21/2017,"The basic Cheesecake Factory in a mall. Busy, loud and takes awhile to get your food. The food is the same as most locations and our waitress was kind."
Andrea B.,"Phoenix, AZ",99,82,10,3.0,8/14/2017,"I'm not really a fan of large restaurant chains like The Cheesecake Factory, so it really takes a lot to wow me. That being said - this place is okay. The menu is extensive so there's something for everyone, however, since they don't exactly have a specialty, all the entrees come across as bland. My sliders we soggy and several of the other appetizers we tried were average at best. Big surprise - the cheesecake is good.  Pro tip: Grab dinner at one of the other restaurants in the Biltmore area and reserve The Cheesecake Factory for dessert."
Larry H.,"Los Angeles, CA",119,352,32,1.0,8/9/2017,"Well, we were all very hungry and we picked Cheesecake factory as it was 1 pm and the crowd was mostly gone.   We got seated promptly, however, our waitress seemed like she was rushing at every pass.  Ordering our drinks, our food, it was like sit down and tell her immediately what we want.  There was no warmth there at any level.  Very poor service.  We felt very uncomfortable. Needless to say, we ordered our salads and we ordered Ranch and got Vinagarette!  How does that happen?  RUSHING!!!!  We had to get them replaced twice. We ordered our entree's along with an appetizer.  So, I don't know what the Brea Ca location is doing right, but the other locations need to follow it.  The QA at this facility was atrocious. We tried the Fried zucchini once again and once again, let down.  There was zero, zip, nada flavor at all.  In Brea, they had awesome seasoning and were cooked perfectly.  Here it was dumped and served.  Just terrible.  I ordered the Eggplant Parmasean for my Entree.  We waited about 20 minutes only for the waitress to come back and say they were out.  How can you be out of Eggplant at lunch at 1 pm???  Again, lack of rigor and discipline in the kitchen as you should never run out of anything especially a top seller. So I had to find something else and ordered the Truffle Honey Chicken.  What a disappointment.  Two small pieces of this so called chicken were as hard as a rock.  You had a very hard time cutting it with the sharpest knife and it was un-edible as it was too hard to chew.  It was like eating rocks. The Gumbo was ok, but slopped in the bowl and lacked any presentation as well as the orange chicken. We tried to end on a good note with a piece of their new Celebration Cheesecake.  Well, unless you like Icing and I mean a lot of icing this is for you.  However, if you like a cake along with your icing this is not for you.  This was layer and layer of icing on a very, very small sliver of cake.  What a waste.  This one needs to be shelved. Needless to say, Cheesecake Factory lacks QA across the board and the food gets wasted as it cannot be eaten.  Very frustrated on this visit."
Patricia B.,"Phoenix, AZ",65,335,363,3.0,2/16/2017,"I thought I had already written reviews for both of the Cheesecake Factory locations we frequent the most. Not very pleased lately, one of our most recent visits to this one I had a steak with a side of broccoli, sans the broccoli. My server never brought my side even after we brought it to her attention.  And they did not even give us a discount or comp...  We liked them very much in the past but we have not had the best experiences recently, both at Biltmore and North Scottsdale."
Elizabeth B.,"Goodyear, AZ",33,34,27,2.0,8/3/2017,"The Philly cheesesteak bread is real tough.  It was very hard to eat.  In fact, I could not eat more than four bites and when I mentioned this to the server, she really didn't care.   They do have a good kids meal selection, and the cheesecake was good, of course.   The bathroom was very messy.  Paper towels were everywhere.   Also, my son got a kids meal but was charged $3 for his drink.  When she asked what size for him, I wish I was told the drink with the kids meal was free and the bigger was $3.   Be careful when you leave because there is a column by the door with a square bottom. I hit my knee on the corner and was lucky it didn't break the skin because it was chipped."
Dwayne O.,"Scottsdale, AZ",242,625,5495,4.0,11/8/2016,"Always a good meal here with such an expansive menu. Love the bread at the beginning, warm Sourdough or a brown bread. Ordered many meals here and would recommend the Miso Glazed Salmon, Shrimp over Angel Hair Pasta, Orange  Chicken, Chicken Marsala with Mushrooms and their Build Your Own Omelette. Then save room for the cheesecake of course, depending on your taste you can't be beat here. I go for the old school Strawberry Cheesecake, Oreo Dream Extreme Cheesecake, Kahlua Cocoa Coffee Cheesecake. Prices are in the $12 - $20 range with good quality and huge portions. Service is always top notch. Even though this is a chain, it is always a go to restaurant and open late for the late night eaters."
Heather F.,"Bakersfield, CA",193,204,435,2.0,9/15/2017,"We get here after long day of driving to Arizona. We sit down big group. Waitress rude she never asks if it's one bill or two takes everyone's order.    25 min later food comes out. , my daughters seafood pasta had a horrible smell so we tell her she says what do u want instead we order 30 mins later we get it .  Waitress needs more training she was slow rude never filled our drinks we had to ask others to do.  Would I return nope not at all"
Paul P.,"Queen Creek, AZ",3,29,3,4.0,11/29/2017,"Clean, great service and the cheesecake is off the chain! The food is always fresh and cooked to perfection. I also highly recommend brunch on Sundays, the pancakes is a must have."
Sarah J.,"Phoenix, AZ",19,103,34,5.0,9/6/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory is a well oiled, fine tuned machine. They have good food, good service, great ambiance, fun atmosphere, and reasonable prices.  The first thing you notice about Cheesecake Factory is how enormous and grandeur it is. The colors are beautiful and warm, and even though it is a huge restaurant each table feels tucked away and private. This is a great place for a romantic dinner for two, or for a giant group. There is a bar area with tvs for game watching, and a patio for when it's nice outside, so there's a place for everyone to be happy.  The staff is wonderful; everyone greets you warmly and seems to love what they do. The servers are extremely attentive, efficient, quick, and bend over backwards to make sure you are happy and get what you want. They know the menu front to back which is quite impressive considering it is about 20 pages long. The most difficult thing about eating at The Cheesecake Factory is figuring out what you want to eat. The menu is HUGE, and offers everything; pastas, steaks, gourmet chicken dishes, seafood, salads, burgers, sandwiches, wings, quesadillas, and even breakfast. You name it, most likely they have it! You would think with such a large menu the food would be mediocre, but on the contrary it is actually delicious. I have never had a bad meal here or been disappointed with a dish. They even bring out warm bread and butter to get you started. If you save room don't forget their cheesecakes, they are exceptional.  Cheesecake Factory is a great place for a solid meal any time of the day. You'll find something for everyone and you'll go home full, satisfied, and most likely with lots of leftovers!"
James E.,"Fullerton, CA",68,5,2,2.0,10/7/2017,"I took my wife here last night for her birthday, I informed the hostess of her birthday and requested a happy birthday song by the staff.. no problem was her reply.. as we ate dinner, we heard 4 birthday songs being sang to various patrons.. we finished dinner and received the bill but no birthday song for my wife so we paid and left.. Our next Cheesecake Factory visit will be elsewhere ."
Becca N.,"Phoenix, AZ",54,414,33,5.0,4/22/2017,Totally a fan of cheesecake factory. Wasn't busy and we got $7 valet anyways. They validate if you self park. Only downside: my bench seat is in need of repairs
Alyssa F.,"Grover Beach, CA",3,60,423,1.0,1/16/2017,"Tastes like dog food. All of it.  Like oh my god.  Worse than apple bees.  I wouldn't even give a homeless person this as a meal...... They probably wouldn't even eat it. Bad service, took forever. I wasted so much gas waiting in the takeout parking spot. The shrimp roll.... Had ONE HALF of a shrimp in each roll..... I guess that's the portion for real... The sauces that come with it are garbage, inedible.  The noodles in it are gross. Overall a bad choice. So disappointing.  Crab artichoke dip tastes like canned TUNA and rotten. I felt like throwing up after I ate it. Plus they gave me four tiny slices of bread for a huge portion of fishy nasty dip. Just pretend you mixed cream cheese with cat food and warmed it up... There you go. Edemame, freaking soggy and salty... Potstickers..... Tasted like canned chicken... Sauce was super strong and nasty. Looked frozen and microwaved. $55 FOR THIS  FIFTY FIVE DOLLARS..............::::: FIFTY.       FIVE.    DOLLLARS.        WHAT THE HELL. I am without words.  I have been to a cheese cake factory before in CA. It was edible atleast... This one was a JOKE.  One word.  DISGUSTING.  We're still hungry and threw it all out. Had to go get a burger some where else. The stand $6 for a burger... What a relief. $6  SIX DOLLARS  SIX.   DOLLARS.   Cheese cake factory.... How are you in business ??? And how do you live with yourself feeding people all of this nasty food... I wonder how many people have been sick and disappointed from eating here... Stay away. Go to the stand or honestly Taco Bell, McDonalds... Anywhere else... Yuck id rather eat pink slime from McDonald's than cheese cake factory ever again... I am in complete shock that this nasty food is being served and people come here...  If I wanted to eat rotten tuna artichoke dip I could have made that myself and it probably would have tasted better than cheese cake factory.. You call yourself chefs...  Hahah.  Awful."
Mya C.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,1,,1.0,12/28/2017,"Food wasn't good. Server was not nice- said about two words and left. We came on around 11 and it wasn't busy, so not sure why the sever was so quick and choppy about everything-seemed very rude. Shirley temple had wayyy too much grenadine. I ordered some dish with bow tie pasta and chicken, and I kid you not, there were five tiny pieces of chicken and god knows how much pasta. Will not be going here again."
Vicki M.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,26,6,4.0,11/7/2017,"Way too much on their menu, I've been here so many times I have my go to favorites now.  Steak Diane, Shepherd's pie, Chicken Bellagio, spaghetti and meatballs. The worst dish I had was the fish n chips they were either not completely cooked or a different style than I was used to, everything else has been spectacular. My go to place when entertaining guests or celebrating events."
Adam B.,"San Francisco, CA",0,1,,1.0,12/26/2017,"I would have to say one of the worst experiences I have ever had in the last 41 years of my life. I came in tonight to take my wife to dinner for our anniversary ... Waited forever for my food, thank god there was bread. When my food finally arrived it was cold!! I was so upset, but couldn't ruin my night out with her. So then I went to leave thinking.. hey maybe it was just me... and then thought I should order some cheesecake as I leave... did that.. waited another 20 minutes for the dessert. I must say today was not only a waste of my money but a waste of my anniversary dinner! I wouldn't suggest spending an important night here! only hopes will be let down!!"
Carrie F.,"Phoenix, AZ",94,108,103,4.0,8/21/2016,"I literally came for the avocado egg rolls! The dipping sauce that is comes with is a sweeter flavor and then  mixed with the salty egg rolls are a good combo! For another appetizer I ordered the appetizer caesar- the thing was huge!! and this was the appetizer size? Defiantly could split the salad.  For main entree got the chicken Bellagio! It was good , nothing special to write home about. It's a flatten chicken cutlet over a bed of angel hair pasta and like a pesto sauce. To me cheesecake has this large menu but lacks the "" taste"" factor since they have such menu! Ordered the red sangria to drink with the meal - it was tasty but I was pretty appalled that it was $9.25 ..I could have easily had three."
Dave P.,"Sierra Vista, AZ",1,17,1,1.0,10/8/2017,You miss the major point here which is quality of service as well as product. When we go out for a meal we would like to have a quality dining experience.
Morgan T.,"Scottsdale, AZ",208,42,2,5.0,10/11/2017,Excellent service and the variety of food makes a great place for family and friends. I highly recommend it as the service is fast and accommodating
Kenneth T.,"Vancouver, Canada",3,45,,5.0,10/28/2017,The food is consistent excellent but the menu can be daunting with all the selection! Serving size is always generous as many American restaurants are. Highly recommended.
Arielle R.,"Phoenix, AZ",378,11,11,5.0,11/1/2017,Just ate at this location with my best friend and enjoyed our little feast. We ordered two of their typhoon martini drinks which were AMAZING & got their zucchini appetizer. Yum. We then ordered the combination meal with steak & salmon & that was delicious. Great service. Truly a perfect dining experience. Thanks Cheesecake Factory!
Tara B.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,16,21,5.0,8/18/2017,"We went on our anniversary for drinks and cheesecake. Sour apple martinis, Godiva chocolate cheesecake(oh yes) and wonderful conversation with our bartender. You can never go wrong with this place. Oh and the menu has even MORE options now...."
Liliana C.,"Phoenix, AZ",51,74,23,3.0,6/27/2017,"A great place to go always. Nice bar area and great service. The banana cream cheesecake is my favorite cheesecake. Please be careful all of their menu options have like a bazillion calories but they recently started offering a skinny version menu and all the items on there are great. Shrimp tacos!!! Burgers !!! Uuu the appetizer stuffed mushrooms are to die for and I also love the appetizer avocado rolls oh my God so delicious! Nice date location, and girls dinner out.  .."
Sam H.,"Tempe, AZ",243,42,24,3.0,5/1/2017,"I just don't understand why the Cheesecake Factory is so hyped up!  I'll start by saying I have not been here for quite some time and was excited to give it another try.  When we walked in we asked for a table outside and then after waiting for 20 min they sat us inside, after reminding her we wanted outside we were told it would be another 25 min because she forgot. Our waitress was useless, she messed up more things about our order than I could have ever imagined, and dropped two of our dishes upon bringing them to our table (This caused us to wait even longer due to remaking of our food.).  After always needing to ask for more water and asking three times for mayo, saying she was awful is an understatement.   The only reason this place is getting three stars is because when you finally get the food it's always pretty good with nice serving sizes. All in all, I won't be in a hurry to come back anytime soon.   Return factor 15%"
Lanny A.,"Phoenix, AZ",2,25,11,1.0,5/22/2017,One our favorite go to place with variety of wonderful delights! Enough said about what the food would have tasted like. The last two trips here have always been a nightmare NOT with the wait staff but the host and or hostesses   They stuck us back in the east side if the seating are with all sorts if open tables. Ince back there there was twi very large parties that were so loud you couldn't hear yourself think. We excused ourselves from the wait staff to be seated in another area. She said it would be 5 minutes. After watching several couples and groups get seated right away  and 27 minutes later without a word from the hostess we left Wont be back to this location   Better to read the reviews and believe them!! !
Richard Y.,"Downey, CA",34,17,,1.0,4/15/2017,Avoid this place like the Black Plague. Food is good but holy sh** the attitude from the lady at the register in the front is terrible. I'm sure she thought I didn't catch her but I sure did... will NOT return to this location and maybe just opt out of going to Cheesecake Factory in general.  My .02 cents for her is if you don't like your job. Quit.
Ondrea B.,"Phoenix, AZ",58,90,234,4.0,5/5/2017,We came to the cheesecake factory to celebrate a birthday and enjoy a nice family dinner. Our reservation was accurate and they had our table ready upon arrival. The service was good as was the food. Thr waitress suggested eggplant Parmesan which was good and to be honest I've never seen it on the 15 page menu that they have. We enjoyed one slice of shared red velvet cheesecake which was delicious as well as take-home cheesecakes which were equally as good. The Asian lettuce wrap tacos are always a good lite choice and if you're here on the day when they have the chicken artichoke soup I would highly suggest getting a cup.  It is one of the most delicious soups I've ever had!
Jean S.,"Fountain Hills, AZ",26,124,34,4.0,3/12/2017,"Was treated for my birthday by an awesome group of friends. The food was excellent. Always is for me. The cheesecake of course, was to die for. If I had one ""minus"" it is the lighting. When you have to use your cell phone just to see the menu, and I am by no means visually impaired, well maybe they could consider some type of ambient light. There was nothing. Not even a candle. A small pendant light would have even been good. There still wasn't enough light to read through the menu.  Waitstaff was okay as well. She might have been pretty new though. She did do a good job."
V S.,"Phoenix, AZ",2,15,,1.0,2/26/2017,"Don't go here.    1. The server took too long to take our order.  2. We waited at least 30 minutes for our food.  3. I don't remember the server being attentive. 4. Server disappeared toward the end of our meal and we were basically left without a server at all. Other servers brought us a refill and another took our payment.  Environment: 1. The lights were SO dim I wasn't comfortable. I could barely see!  2. The customers dining there that night were extremely loud and I heard profanity a good handful of times within just one hour that I was there. I felt like I was at a dive-in bar. It wasn't my usual experience like at other Cheesecake Factories.  The food-- 4. I ordered black pepper shrimp, the rice was so overcooked :(  5. In general, my food was less than flavorful.  Price-- WE PAID $70 for 2 of us, luckily I had a gift card to pay for part of that. I wouldn't go back."
Brian P.,"Surprise, AZ",1,50,,3.0,6/4/2017,"Not the best Cheesecake experience. Out of the 5-6 times, this was the worst... here is why: 1. Missing items... No croutons on salad. No grilled onion on burger. No ranch as requested.  2. Bread was refrigerated cold. 3. Seats were dirty. Gf had to grab a napkin from another table to wipe off the seat before she could sit down. 4. Walked passed a bus tub overloaded with dirty dishes just sitting in a booth... not a good impression walking to our table. 5. Fries were not hot. The food and service were good. Wouldn't recommend or return to this location based on our experience though."
Nicole S.,"Surprise, AZ",0,26,8,1.0,7/15/2016,"Stopped at Biltmore Cheesecake Factory on my way home from Mesa to Surprise.  I ordered from the take out, Chicken Maderia without mushrooms, still want the sauce just no mushrooms because I don't like the texture of mushrooms. I knew by the time i got home I was going to reheat it. I opened it and sadly saw the best part missing the sauce! Bummed I reheated it for 20 minutes.  The potatoes were still not cook at all!  They were hard as a rock.  Tried cooking it longer and just pitched the potatoes.  Then took a bite of the chicken and it was undercooked!   So overall it sucked!"
Jen H.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,8,,2.0,9/7/2017,"The food wasn't the greatest, especially for the price I paid for my meal. The food was served cold and had zero flavor. I'm sad to say that the cheesecake we had after dinner tasted old... it had that old refrigerator taste, so the cheesecake was yucky too. I will not be going back."
