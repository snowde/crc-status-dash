Bradford K.,"Glendale, AZ",140,10,1,1.0,2/16/2015,Our appetizer and main course came cold. Our server forgot about us for a good 20 minutes while we waited for the check. I've had great service here before but not today.
Annie C.,"Denver, CO",42,5,,3.0,5/13/2015,Mediocre food. I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs and it was VERY SALTY. All I tasted was salt. I had to send it back after 2 bites! Very disappointing. It's the simplest dish. Our server was very friendly and had a great attitude so not a total loss.
Tyger L.,"Phoenix, AZ",230,307,44,4.0,3/9/2011,"I have to admit, I have been one of those people who has had nothing positive to say about Cheesecake Factory in the past (other than, they had awesome cheesecakes)...however, last night, after traipsing my in-laws all through the town, upstairs and downstairs in their nightgowns, trying to look for some dinner, we finally ended up here. And it was AWESOME! Great service, delicious food, yummy drinks...they were 100% on point. I wonder if perhaps I have just been choosing the wrong entrees all along, or if something has changed with them, but whatever the case, last night was awesome.  At our table, we had two stand-out dishes, the chicken madeira with steak diane, and the caramel chicken something or other. The other two dishes were good, but nothing spectacular, and this is a review about what made me happy, so pbbbbbbbbbt! So much so, that we ordered a couple of cheesecakes to go. The lemon raspberry cheesecake, by the way, is phenomenal...raspberry lady fingers, lemon cheesecake, fresh-ish whipped cream...yum yum! I'll have to wait to get feedback regarding the white chocolate macadamia nut caramel cheesecake though. So, that being said, I will no longer sully your name with negative comments or nay-saying...and I will be back. Thank you for a great evening."
Shirley S.,"Phoenix, AZ",74,120,827,3.0,8/18/2011,"I've been to Cheesecake Factory about six times, about three of them at this location. I'm not much of a fan of chain restaurants, but I must say the decor and ambiance have been nice and the restaurant always clean.  On a past visit I had a Buffalo Chicken sandwich which is no longer on the menu...and probably with good reason. It was the sort of quality I'd expect from a fast food drive-thru, only a larger portion and served on a plate. This time, I had the Cuban Sandwich with a Green Salad side. The sandwich wasn't bad, just not memorable. The portion was plenty for lunch and some to take home. My friend had the equivalent of Chicken Parmesan with a side of spaghetti (don't see it currently listed on their website menu) which he downed in no time, despite the large portion. At the server's recommendation, we shared the Hershey®'s Chocolate Bar Cheesecake, which was fresh and flavorful.  The second server (the first one's shift had ended) was late in bringing some water I'd asked for. While I wasn't concerned about it, he noticed his own service was too slow and he promised to ""make it up"" to me. Not sure what that meant and I never saw any benefit.  While the portions were more than ample, I'm not sure the prices are in line for the quality being offered. Two lunch entrees with nonalcoholic beverages and one dessert came to about $50.00. For the money, I would've preferred to go elsewhere.  I will say I've stopped by the carry out counter for cheesecake to go before and absolutely LOVE the Lemon Raspberry and will always consider it a ""go-to option to-go""!!!"
Taylor K.,"St. Petersburg, FL",0,50,17,5.0,6/5/2015,"I went in for dessert and coffee by myself. I couldn't decide between my top 4 picks for cheesecake (SO MANY OPTIONS. IT'S OVERWHELMING.) I listed my top 4 options, and my super sweet waiter offered to bring my piece as a surprise. Delightful! The cheesecake was fantastic, and my waiter was (ugh, pun intended) the cherry on the top! :) Will definitely go back when my sweet tooth strikes again."
Mary M.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,46,,2.0,2/5/2016,"Nice place, friendly service, but ""meh"" just about describes the food experience. My friend had a pasta dish that should have had ""with shrimp"" in teeny tiny letters as those were in short supply. I had about the simplest thing on the menu--the Regina Special, with soup (good), salad (okay), and a mayonnaise sandwich, aka chicken salad with almonds. In this case, the chicken should have been in teeny tiny letters and the almonds must have been disguised as mayonnaise, and a very good disguise it was. Yuk! No crunch, no color, no like. Be ashamed, Cheesecake Factory. Be very ashamed."
Tobi W.,"Phoenix, AZ",227,12,,3.0,3/25/2014,Food great Crazy at 7.00 pm lights automatically dimmed in entire restaurant and guests were eating by cell phone light
Tina T.,"Phoenix, AZ",31,54,2,4.0,5/30/2013,"I love CF, such a charming place to eat with TONS of options.  This lunch visit was no exception, met a friend and ate with our two young ones in tow (7&8). We ordered the lunch Renee's special - 1/2 sandwich, side salad AND a cup of soup.  I loved this option and it's rare, you usually pick 2.  The cup was more like a bowl, the 1/2 sandwich was still a good size (LOVED the chicken salad with almonds) and the side salad was also pretty big.   I love their bread basket, especially the wheat oat - yum! The kids got nice sized portions of their meal - great options for the young ones, too.  LOVE the $1 ice cream scoop. I love coming here and always want to come right back to try something else on their huge menu."
Tony K.,"Phoenix, AZ",21,268,99,3.0,1/2/2015,"It has been two years since we have been to the restaurant.  Normally  the lines are too long . We got there and the front area was packed but the lines moved quickly. I was pleasantly surprised . It appears that several parties may have left or went shopping.  The bread was good and  scarfed it down quickly.  The portions are huge , enough for two . Our server brought us plates for the bread that were dirty except for the top plate. We ordered the spicy cashew chicken,  this tasked like a cheap version of orange chicken . It was extremely salty and deep fried. . I don't recall getting any cashews. We also ordered Asian salad. It was drenched with salad dressing which was too salty we had the jambalaya chicken and shrimp which we liked but they must have forgotten the sauce. I wanted to order cheese cake but was stuffed"
Rachel S.,"Phoenix, AZ",9,4,1,5.0,3/16/2015,My husband and I tried it for the very first time the food was amazing and the waiter James was amazing as well we will be going back there again and hopefully I can get James again his service was by far the best I have had in a long time so thank you James
Chris C.,"St. Louis, MI",0,9,,1.0,2/24/2015,"Went here last night with a group of friends to celebrate a birthday. I ordered the Herb Encrusted Salmon and it was quite delicious. However, herb encrusted salmon does not taste quite as good when you're throwing it up. Currently sitting in the doctors office waiting for meds over a bad case of food poisoning. Thanks Cheesecake Factory!"
Becky V.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,19,,5.0,1/23/2015,"I have gone to this specific location many times, but I have never had such great service as I did on my most recent visit. Our waiter was Tim and he was fantastic (the main reason why I wrote this review). He was funny, attentive and, personable. I ordered the herb crusted salmon and, like always, was happy with the dish. If I was able to give Tim a raise, I would- he definitely deserves it."
Anthony N.,"Chicago, IL",364,291,189,3.0,8/24/2013,"Huge menu leaves something for everyone.  Prices can get up there, even for seemingly simple dishes. The good thing is that most items (even salads and sandwiches) will get you multiple servings unless you're super hungry. I'm a fan of their rye bread. People think I'm weird when I compare other calamari to the one that's served here.  That said, I wonder how much of the food is actually prepared fresh from scratch. A lot of the dishes are drenched in salt. My friend couldn't eat his pasta because it was so salty.  Service was slow and ""meh"" at best. Cheesecake is good for its convenience and familiarity. In the future, I'd rather spend the same money or less at a local restaurant."
Luca C.,"Phoenix, AZ",12,209,3,2.0,10/10/2013,"The people were nice but the food was really hit or miss. The appetizers were sloppy, most things were greasy and started falling apart if that makes sense. The pizza was soggy and overly cheesed. The burger came in over cooked. Maybe we should have  just stuck with the cheesecake."
Rosalind C.,"Los Angeles, CA",105,137,60,4.0,6/22/2011,"I have been eating at the Cheesecake Factory for years and no matter what city or state I'm in I can always count on them for consistently good food!  I decided to try this location out for my birthday meal since I was craving their chicken chipotle pasta. We started out with the standard bread basket and I had a strawberry lemonade. Our server was crazy busy but he still took care of us for the most part. My chicken chipotle pasta that I also add shrimp too was so delish the sauce is a little creamy but has a kick to it from the chipotle flavoring. The asparagus, tortilla chips, chicken and shrimp  just work perfectly with the sauce and the penne pasta! This is def. my go to entree at the Cheesecake Factory. For dessert since I'm not a fan of cheesecake I went for the carrot cake and it was everything I wanted and more! Moist delicious cake with nuts, raisins and carrots and just enough frosting.  I have also met my girls at this location several times for happy hour and they have an awesome menu menu with $5 appetizers and drink specials! And the portions are huge 1 appetizer can serve as a meal or can be shared easily.  Cheesecake Factory never disappoints, I will always be a fan :-)"
Nancy S.,"Novato, CA",311,191,130,5.0,4/4/2014,I do love cheesecake!  Those two words should not be combined to create a word to describe such deliciousness...but I will not allow such transgressions to distract from my indulgences!  The CF does such an excellent job...I should have ordered two to go.  The red velvet is superb...I'm now wearing it permanently on bum.  Yes...once on my lips and bam...there it is!!
Jacqueline M.,"FORT HUACHUCA, AZ",38,45,1,3.0,7/1/2013,This is a nice location. We were seated quickly and our food was quick to come out.  We sat in a booth that was like sitting on a bench. We noticed the other booths were well padded. I don't know if this was intentional but it was uncomfortable after about 30 minutes and we ended up getting our meals to go. That was a definite draw back.
ronnie g.,"Phoenix, AZ",96,13,1,2.0,7/12/2014,"I've been going to the Cheesecake Factory for years now and it's become my favorite restaurant. This location, however, is my least favorite. I went in for dinner one night and had Michelle C as a server and it just seemed like she was in a bad mood and didn't want to be there that night. I'll take my business elsewhere thank you."
Denise L.,"Rochester, MN",6,32,,4.0,12/13/2015,"The Thai Glazed Salmon and Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp are both out-of-this-world delicious! I would have given this 5 stars if our server had been even 1 star. While he started out acceptable, he left us sitting for 20 minutes after he took our credit cards. We could see him tending to other tables, but he never came back. We finally gathered up our leftover and went to the front desk to get their assistance in retrieving our credit cards and receipts. This server experience will not keep me from returning to this restaurant because the food is awesome!"
S. Rose M.,"Glendale, AZ",0,16,9,4.0,6/23/2014,"Went here the day before my birthday with my boyfriend, everything was delicious as usual. Probably the first time I didnt have a vey nice server, he was kind of distant, but he was on top of things for the most part, normally the servers ask if we re celebrating something but he didnt, not did he ask if we wanted an appetizer. We sat for a long time, being a server I can see how that can be a little annoying but we did leave him a 35% tip."
