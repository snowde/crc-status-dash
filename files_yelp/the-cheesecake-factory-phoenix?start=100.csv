Jennifer R.,"Phoenix, AZ",1,7,,4.0,6/7/2016,"Went to eat dinner tonight with my best friend and son, always have a good experience. Food is awesome! Only downfall tonight was waiter took a little long to take our order, and the lights went out while we were eating. We were really dying for desert after our meal and it was a real bummer the lights went out so we got the check and left!  Other than that food was great!"
Nelya Z.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,4,,5.0,12/31/2016,Great food great service never had a problem when coming here everything is always fresh waiters are always nice and the cheese cake is to die for
Yasmeen A.,"Phoenix, AZ",53,63,115,3.0,3/7/2015,"When we got here we were spoken to right away which was nice. We waited about 5 minutes before being seated. The waitress was very nice. For appetizers we had buffalo wings and fried zucchini. The wings were very good and the zucchini was average, not a lot of flavor. I had a Patron margarita on the rocks and it was one of the best I have had. My boyfriend had a mango margarita frozen and it was okay. I ordered the fish tacos and they were extremely bland I had to send them back. I was very disappointed in them. Even the rice and beans were not that good.He had a cheeseburger which he said he liked. I got a slice of Godiva chocolate cheesecake to go and I loved it. We sat at a booth which was stiff as a rock. If I do come back it'll be for the margarita and the cheesecake."
Danyel M.,"Boston, MA",33,17,103,2.0,3/8/2015,"As we walked in, the front desk staff was very friendly and we only had to wait about 3 minutes to get sat outside.  Our waitress came to the table quickly and right away offered to tell us the specials. We alerted her immediately that we were there to enjoy dessert. I was in the mood for a piece of cheesecake and when I saw they had a pineapple upside down one on their menu, the decision was made.  Unfortunately, the pineapple upside down cheesecake was all gone which left me having to decide on another dessert. I chose the strawberry shortcake. However, when it arrived I was very disappointed. The shortcake was very hard and cold, not fresh whatsoever. On the top of the shortcake their was a sugar crust made with raw sugar. The strawberries were the best thing about this dessert.  I won't be going back, but if you do - good luck, this place is hit and miss."
Leah S.,"St Petersburg, FL",42,14,2,5.0,10/25/2016,"Came here with my friend for happy hour and was really surprised.  Great hh menu and prices. Giovanni, our server, was excellent and very attentive.  He looked out for me with my second drink order which he got in before hh ended (M-F 4-6). If your like for good food, atmosphere and service this is the place to go.  I will definitely be back"
Class A.,"Las Vegas, NV",61,78,5,3.0,11/9/2016,They sent a $10 gift card... went back and tried the Oreo and Macadamia Nut... they redeemed themselves... guess it was an off night last visit.
Fernanda G.,"Central City, Phoenix, AZ",8,1,,2.0,6/5/2017,"The 2  is just because the CS from Georgina M other than that the food wasnt good, the chicken on the Bellagio was uncooked, the white beans on the White chx chili were hard It is very sad to see the great neglect of each of the cooks and the lack of responsibility from the chef!"
John F.,"Scottsdale, AZ",55,46,1,1.0,12/10/2015,"I'm not big on chain restaurants but gave this one another try mostly because I was taking a friend and her daughter out for her birthday.   3 people - no alcoholic drinks nearly $80 with the tip, how ridiculous.   Mediocre service, which had to be hunted down several times for water and soft drink refills, they didn't even give my friend anything for her birthday.   Best part is when we were ready to leave, we were told we would have to wait because their systems were down and they couldn't close anyones bill out - so 20 minutes and no apologies or discount later, we got our check.  It will be my last time at any Cheesecake Factory, they can take their overpriced crap and keep it."
Jan C.,"Tempe, AZ",109,1,,3.0,5/2/2016,"Cheesecake Factory is average/trash bc they serve way too many food items for anyone of them to be exceedingly tasty. if you serve gumbo, kale soup, fried oysters, pizza, every italian dish, tacos and dear meat none of them can be that great. not saying that I won't eat cheesecake factory. their alfredo is cool. but I've had some things that just weren't good. at all Cheesecake Factory did excel in the making cheesecake. I will give them that. Who else is feeling positive this evening?"
Amanda K.,"North Beach/Telegraph Hill, San Francisco, CA",14,31,,4.0,10/14/2016,Interesting for breakfast on Sunday which is unexpected and given the wait at all other places really great choice for a larger party instead of waiting at another place.
Kirke R.,"Phoenix, AZ",161,110,184,5.0,12/25/2015,"Yes this is a huge chain restaurant with locations all over the United States but this is a very good one. Every location has a very similar layout and decor, yet each one is uniquely different depending on the space or building it's located in.  The menu is the same though and the food is very good. Everything is very fresh and tastes great. It's a huge menu though which can be frustrating if you are hungry. We are talking everything from Asian to a simple hamburger. Not to worry though, you are going to like whatever you try.  My most recent visit I had the fried macaroni and cheese balls appetizer and a classic hamburger. Both were outstanding!  Staff is always friendly and if something isn't right, they will make it right with no questions asked. They can substitute just about anything on the menu as well.  Cocktails are pretty darn good too, there is a large cocktail menu as well.  You can also visit Grand Lux Cafe, Cheesecake's sister restaurant. Different menu, but just as extensive. Just as good too! Enjoy!"
Matt B.,"Chandler, AZ",0,1,,2.0,1/22/2017,Was picking up a to go order from here. Arrived at the time the order was supposed to be ready and went to the bakery to pick it up. Was told by the woman in the bakery that it wasn't ready yet and she would call us when it was done. Ended up waiting another half hour past the point when the food should have already been done. The same woman finally finished helping all the guests at the bakery and left to go get our food from the back. I have no idea how long it might have been done back there. She gave us our food without any napkins or utensils and left. We ended up having to ask another person there for those things.Will not be going to this Cheesecake Factory again.
Holland H.,"Phoenix, AZ",1,15,2,1.0,1/10/2017,"My boyfriend and I frequent Cheesecake Factory and this last visit at this location was considerably underwhelming. We waited for nearly 30 minutes and requested a booth and was sat in the bar area in at a small section. We let it pass because it was considerably busy and we were hungry. Our server was less than par - he waited on every table except for ours for nearly 10 minutes before he even offered to take our drink order. When we finally got to order 20 minutes later it took an additional 25 minutes to get our food. No where in that time did our server check on us to see if we wanted refills and it wasn't until the table 6in away needed boxes did our server even check in on us. Once we got our food we were ready to go. We asked for our food to be boxed (as most other Cheesecake Factory's will box it for you and he had just boxed the couple's food next to us 10 minutes prior) he threw down 3 boxes (for whatever reason, there were only two plates on our toddler sized table) and when we asked for the check it took an additional 10 minutes to get and another 10 to have picked up. It's safe to say we won't be visiting this location or any other for a bit, it was majorly disappointing."
Cynthia V.,"Sedona, AZ",0,2,,5.0,5/9/2017,The food was SO good and we had an exceptional waitress named Marcie. Its nice to know there are people out there that still believe in great customer service. Thank you for making our experience so lovely after a rough day and making us smile.  We will be driving back even though its not close to our home.
Lanida C.,"Fort Polk, LA",3,4,4,2.0,12/30/2015,"This was our first visit to The Cheesecake Factory. We were greeted nicely at the front door and shown to our table right away. This was nice as we don't usually wait, just a habit.  Our waitress took our drink orders and gave us some time to wait for the rest of our party. When she brought our drinks she tried to drop them off and run, but I caught her and ordered an appetizer. The spinach, artichoke cheese dip was typical, nothing to rave about.  Our party arrived and her drink order was taken and delivered. When our waitress came to take our order we had been catching up and my friend hadn't gotten a chance to look at the menu so she asked if our could be put in while she took a moment to look.  The waitress walked away and I actually caught her rolling her eyes with a look of disgust on her face!  When my friend had gotten a chance to decide she called her over and gave her the order. Our order that was put in about 5 minutes earlier than hers arrived almost 5 minutes after hers.  I ordered a vegan club salad, it was great.  My husband ordered the lemon herb chicken, it was so overboard on the lemon that was all he could taste. Most definitely not worth his money.  My friend ordered the eggplant parmesan and it was so tough she had to borrow my husband's steak knife to cut it.  All in all we waited longer than was necessary but we are OK with that as we were relaxing and enjoying each other's company. The waitress must of been having a bad day, but put on a smile and wasn't rude to our faces. Not worth the $100+ bill for three, may not go back, but may try another one for comparison."
j r.,"Las Vegas, NV",28,27,19,4.0,1/27/2015,Very good rib eye good service and valet parking.  What more can you ask for: ) Now would I go here on a regular basis probably not but it's nice once in awhile to enjoy.
Drew G.,"Phoenix, AZ",104,38,2,2.0,7/27/2015,"I go for lunch or Dinner at least Once a week... I was really Disappointed When i asked for my Chicken Wings For my appetizer ,, The waitress come and told me they are out of Wings.. REALLY??? How can you be out of something .. Does every table order them ?? is that why? SO ""Louie"" the Mgr came  over and said Sorry..we are having trouble with the Kitchen Mgr and his ordering.. You guys Suck!"
Esmeralda R.,"Phoenix, AZ",28,17,,5.0,8/19/2016,Love this place. We usually pick this place for date night. Waiters remember us of all the people that come there. So sweet. delicious food. Especially the cheesecake omg to die for..Fabulous service.
Luis B.,"Phoenix, AZ",6,2,,1.0,9/30/2015,"Only positive that I had from my experience was the food was ok, and neatness of the restaurant, but their customer service is horrible.  The way they handle parties of 6 or more is ridiculous.  I tried to make a reservation for 20 people, could not do it because they do not take reservations.  I get there earlier to get a table and wait for my friends to arrive.  They said they will have one ready for all of us, but could not let us seat at the tables until at least half showed up. So there they kept us for about 45min until we were a total of 10.   To me that is total bullshit, is in the middle of the week, not too busy, just a fiasco from that point forward.  If you are planning to have a big dinner, birthday dinner, or anything involving parties of more than 6 people choose a different restaurant. TOTAL BULLSHIT."
R R.,"Phoenix, AZ",2,44,1,1.0,9/25/2016,Ate today at lunch and last night. Must have a new cook because I got the same Louisiana pasta and it was like i was eating pasta in oil both times. Now I'm writing this feeling nauseated. One star is for the management and my servers.
