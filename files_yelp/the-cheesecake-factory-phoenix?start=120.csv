Amy S.,"Seattle, WA",170,185,38,3.0,8/9/2015,"Came here to enjoy an ""adult milkshake"" and a slice of cheesecake with the boy (what can I say, we were feeling gluttonous that day). We sat at the bar an ordered a Flying Gorilla to split. It had little chunks of chocolate in it and was pretty tasty, no complaints there. The server brought us bread out as well. The brown bread was good, but the white bread was hard as a brick. We also ordered a Smore's Galore cheesecake, and sweet baby Jesus was that a sugary slab of something. It was delicious, but made us both a little sick to our stomachs after a few bites. Not sure how any human being could consume a whole slice in one sitting. When I went home I looked up the calorie count out of curiousity- it was about 1,600 per slice! No wonder it took us three days to finish it! Next time I come, I'll bring a party of 6 for a single slice of cheesecake!"
Amber A.,"Reno, NV",44,168,3,4.0,8/30/2015,"The epic tome of a menu makes for a fun decision process.  It was very busy Saturday night and we had good service and food.  I had both heathy choices and cheesecake and was very pleased with myself.  :)   Apparently this is the place teen girls want to go for thier birthday.  If you are ever stuck trying to figure out a gift idea, get a Cheesecake Factory gift card.  You will be the coolest adult ever."
Ciara M.,"Scottsdale, AZ",41,26,2,5.0,8/1/2016,"This is a five star review because of one amazing waitress! Georgina is the best waiter! We went here for our anniversary and she gave some of the best customer service we have had. She was friendly, attentive, and personable! She spotted a problem before we even mentioned it. When our food arrived the dinner portion seemed a little small but before we told her she walked by and said that doesn't look like a dinner portion- and rushed the plate off to have it fixed. Thank you Georgina!"
Sherry H.,"La Jolla, CA",17,36,23,5.0,7/28/2016,"My best restaurant ever. Love their blackened Salmon, steak Diane, lemon ricotta pancakes, and the mushroom soup (Wednesdays)."
Courtney T.,"Portland, ME",48,80,302,5.0,10/29/2014,The All American Classic eatery! Today I had the Smokehouse BBQ Burger and it was outstanding..I successfully washed it down with a Strawberry Lemonade!
Davon C.,"Glendale, AZ",77,24,2,5.0,7/21/2016,"Best place for me when I have a few extra bucks (and being a a 20 year old college kid that pays his own tuition that's rare) but when I do go, I am given not only great food (CHICKEN FETTUCCINE ALFREDO IS TO DIE FOR) but awesome service. Being a waiter myself they kind of inspire me to try new methods. I always tip over 25% they're that great"
Keila N.,"Beverly Hills, CA",5000,2051,11264,3.0,3/23/2014,"The Cheesecake Factory is located in a shopping center.  It opens at 11.  My girl and I had the herb crusted salmon, steak quesadilla and cookies & cream cheesecake.   The service was flawlessly executed.  The food was ok-nothing noteworthy.  Typical fat laden, oversized portions restaurant."
Jon D.,"Phoenix, AZ",14,69,8,4.0,6/26/2016,"Very nice, but eerily gaudy and quiet. My most recent meal (""Evelyn's Favorite Pasta"") was a bad choice, the pasta was undercooked and the combination was bland, I desperately wanted some tomato sauce or something. But it's Cheesecake Factory, the special favorite of many. Overall all the food is generally good, as is, of course, the cheesecake. Don't come without buying cheesecake, even if you don't have room for it; take a slice home with you. But to my original surprise the first time I came to one of these, Cheesecake Factory is about a dining experience with a very full menu of fine meals."
Perry B.,"Grand Marais, MI",292,187,36,5.0,7/16/2015,"New menu. Been a while since i have been here, most of the time i was here I was getting wasted with some stripper from the Hi-liter down the road. And don't remember much except for kicking them out of my condo the next day...but now that I am old and have settled down with a girl...I decided to kill the old demons of fun at this place and decided to drag the new ball and chain here...because she was craving something sweet and nothing beats a fattening piece of cheesecake...so we went and you should go too.  The Skinny:  A couple of things...the menu got skinnier, to say the least there new menu is fantastic and I like the fact that they didn't destroy an entire rainforest to make it...the old ones I think use to have perfume sample cards come out. and magazine subscription cards...sometimes I would fall asleep just reading thru it... I like the fact that the new menu has the old favorites but also some healthier options. The Skinny shrimp summer rolls...the skinny shrimp taco's and the skinny grilled salmon and at pretty affordable prices!!! Everything was great and our server Dan was fantastic(rainbow)  We ended the night with the Adams Peanut Butter Fudge cheesecake and it was to die for as it should be.  Way to go CCF! 5 stars."
Lisa L.,"Goodyear, AZ",124,362,376,4.0,4/21/2015,Had the crusted salmon with mash potato and asparagus lunch.  All can say is mmm mmm good. This is my first time at a cheesecake factory and wont be my last. Having good company and a good appetite makes a perfect lunch.  The choices on the menu makes it so very hard to decide.  I also have a couple of friends that tell me you can not go wrong with anything on this menu. I would love to come back again maybe on a special occasion because it is special occasion kind of money you will spend. You do get complimentary bread and that is a plus because its not bad at all. I like the wheat one it seemed to be softer than the white.  I did not get the cheesecake maybe next visit.
Matthew P.,"Gilbert, AZ",896,383,1873,4.0,7/15/2014,Today was a group lunch for a friend who is leaving. The service was fantastic - our server's name was Jolynn. The food orders were executed flawlessly and we all had a great time.
O'Zandra F.,"Sulphur, LA",95,209,489,4.0,5/13/2014,"I went here on a Monday evening. I always opt for the chopped salad. It always come to me the same way...delicious! I had a glass of Reisling and end the evening with the Oreo Dream Extreme cheesecake. You are doing your body an injustice if you have not had this cheesecake. OMG! One slice is too big, but you better believe I will finish it on day two!  I sit at the bar and the staff is always talkative and friendly; offering area tips and must-sees."
Christine P.,"Phoenix, AZ",457,306,1872,5.0,3/24/2014,"Loveeeee loveeeee.. you can't go wrong here, everything on the menu is awesomee!!!! The Louisiana chicken pasta is a must, but minus the chicken cause I'm a vegetarian, hehe. The skinnylious   veggie burger was phonomal, with their house salad on the side. Great vinegar sauce, ugh I can write a whole list here. Haha. There mai tais, yummy.  Sex on the beach. ;) RED VELVET CAKE IS AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!"
Michael E.,"Nashua, NH",0,30,14,5.0,1/3/2017,"Went for lunch with a party of 5.  We got a nice round booth.  The calamari appetizer was tasty, and the dinners were excellent.  I had a spicy chicken and shrimp pasta dish that was really good, and took half home with me.  The Godiva chocolate cheesecake was excellent, although we were expecting a larger slice.  The menu is extensive with something for everyone."
Jazlyn R.,"Phoenix, AZ",538,97,21,1.0,4/22/2016,"Went here with about 10-15 people for my friends birthday dinner on Friday night. We did attempt to make a reservation but I guess they don't take reservations after 5pm... Anyways when we walked in the hostesses told us it would be about 15 minutes for a table and we ended up waiting 50 minutes!!! After we sat, we weren't greeted by a server for about 15 more minutes... I ended up going to the front to order food to go because we waited an hour and a half and still the waiter didn't take our order. Management was not helpful at all.. Horrible horrible experience"
M G.,"Beaumont, CA",0,7,,1.0,3/25/2016,"I was very hunrgy and so my family and I decided to go to Cheesecake factory. We like that they have a big menu and that the desserts are huge. But unfortunately, we ended up not having much fun at all. On a Tuesday night, we arrived at 7pm and after only 10 min., were seated at a booth, which we had requested. But the booth was so dimly lit that I could't read my menu! Literally... So after a couple of minutes I asked the waitress if we could change seats and she said if I wanted to do that I would have to get up and ask the hostess myself... to which I replied no. I do not have to get up- I have a waitress who can ask her on my behalf. She rolled her eyes and suggested that if I could;t see I should use my iPhone instead... really? How rude, I thought. Why can;t she just help me instead of trying to be sarcastic? Then the manager comes over and asks me if I would prefer a seat in the middle of the room- with hard chairs. I told him no because our family had just spent 4 hrs on bleachers at the baseball game, so I needed a more comfortable seat. (Not to mention the fact that we specifically asked for a booth from the begging and there are other booths with lights) So he told me that there was no other table. That was simply not true, as there were other tables which had light. There was no sense talking to them. The noise level was really high so I felt like they could't really hear me- or else were;t trying. I was wanting them to help me, but they were too busy to care. They basically said take it or leave it. I ended up using my iPhone and letting the kids eat... I drank water since I had lost my appetite. It's hard to want to to eat drink and be merry when you are treated like you don;t belong. I did;t bother getting drinks, or dessert, since I just wanted to leave asap.  I also tried not to be upset with the fact that the waitress barely came to our table and we had to flag her down for napkins, forks, water, ranch, bread... It was exhausting. We left disappointed. I reluctantly left a tip even though I felt like writing her a note on how to treat your fellow man. But I decided that nothing I would say could change their rude, insensitive demeanor. After all, it was such a small request and they made such a big deal out of it. Apparently business is so good that they don't have to treat customers with respect.  After that experience, I doubt I'll be back anytime soon... but that's OK... I doubt they'll miss me..."
Ivan T.,"El Paso, TX",47,64,46,5.0,7/22/2014,"I LOVE LOVE LOVE the Cheesecake Factory. It was love at first bite for my partner and I, and we have made it a must in every trip we have made to Phoenix. - The ambiance is very nice with subdued lighting and nice background music. Staff was always been very attentive and corteous. - Portions are generous and packed with flavor (so far I have only ordered something I didn't fully like). This last time I got the Chicken Bellagio and my partner got the Pasta Carbonara, which were LIFE giving. We had plenty of left overs to prolong our Cheesecake Factory reverie the next day. - the cheesecakes are always fantastic. I got the 30th anniversary chocolate cheesecake and my partner got the Adam's Peanut Butter cup cheesecake. Very decadent and rich in consistency. The prices are a bit high, but it's the CF. You don't go to be all dietetic and stingy. All in all it has become one of the best chain restaurants I have ever visited."
James G.,"Gilbert, AZ",3,46,15,5.0,4/17/2014,The SkinnyLicious Menu was outstanding this evening and the service was above and over the top !
Stephanie S.,"Gilbert, AZ",1,48,1,5.0,12/16/2016,"To be honest I used to live off the best menu item which was the juicy portabella mushroom burger, I would pick it up for lunch at least 3x per week, in addition to going there for dinner....a total addiction until they took it off the menu. That's ok, I needed a change. I love the Thai lettuce wraps with peanut dressing that's another serious addiction. The sweet Hawaiian salad tastes like candy. All of the salads are among the best salads you can get anywhere. The Chicken Marsala is fantastic. The simple four cheese pasta is crack. Oh the salmon rice dish with a light lemon sauce will fill you up yet you'll feel good. Those suggested pasta dishes are really good. Steak and ribs was ok, yet I order that at a stake house. Fish and chips yummy. Burgers are fantastic. The size of the burrito reminds you of your first born child. So again, I'll admit when I lived down the street at the Biltmore Estates I went here for dinner at least 4x per week at my sons request. But it's always nice and quiet, easy to have great conversations.  Consistent quality food, tons of variety to satisfy everyone's  tastes. Esp great when you don't feel like doing dishes. The appetizers are all very good as well."
Louise R.,"Phoenix, AZ",1,20,1,2.0,2/28/2016,"So I have been coming here for the four years I have lived in the area. This is the second time the service is absolutely atrocious within the last month. They do not have this or ran out of that, oh wait we do! Oh bad news we do not after all!  And all they say is sorry. Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me.  Done"
