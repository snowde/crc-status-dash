Sandoval D.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,3,1,1.0,1/6/2016,"I come on in with my girlfriend it was  nice welcome then our server came over did not ask how are we or any thing did not give us his name he just came up and ask ""what can I get you"" in a really downward voice and then I ordered a beer and a long island I'm half way down with my beer and he take it without asking me if I was done and he never came to check up on us. I felt like he could have been more friendly and kind to me and my girlfriend he could have started by saying ""hello, I will be your server tonight what may I get you two tonight"" instead of ""what can I get you"" and have less of a mean look at us and what got me off the most was can you even pay for your drink all because I ask how much it is that really get me mad"
Lynnette G.,"Phoenix, AZ",242,300,247,2.0,2/4/2015,"We came here for my friends birthday and it was such a fiasco! We called ahead and stated we had 20 people and the host said we should be able to get a table no problem. Sure enough they had to scramble and find room for us outside saying they never take reservations and had no idea we were coming. The parking situation is horrible and you have to remember to get validated. I ordered the four cheese pasta with chicken and the noodles just weren't cooked right. In my opinion, there are too many menu items and they should shrink it to the stuff they know they can do right! I had to add an extra star for the cheesecake though!"
J. H.,"Phoenix, AZ",1,4,1,1.0,5/3/2016,"A friend & I decided to go to Cheesecake Factory because it was close to work & we hadn't been in a long time. We were seated immediately & it took 10 minutes to get someone to take our drinks order. Now. Some of you might be thinking, ""You're being unreasonable."" No. Think of a place that you go for service where is acceptable to be acknowledged after 10 minutes when is not busy as fuck. This place was no where near busy. We are then greeted by Giovanni who was plenty friendly, but not a great waiter. After taking our order we advised that we were on a break from work so we would like the check immediately. We received our check last.  Our food arrived with 20 minutes to spare from our break. He said that he would bring to go boxes with our order. Not only did we never get a to go box, but we had to borrow one of there mother fucking napkins to bring our food with us. Again, I know some of y'all are thinking, ""Bitch, you didn't have to bring your leftovers!"" Yes we did. We paid for that shit. In conclusion, hold your shit to a higher standard instead of letting your wait staff get so high. Be as baked as you would like, just handle your high & bring us a damn doggie bag!"
Vee W.,"Laveen Village, AZ",12,48,34,4.0,4/24/2015,I love this restaurant! I come here often and each time that I have come I have had great food as well as great service. I will continue to visit here.
Sedine S.,"Los Angeles, CA",54,726,26,3.0,3/7/2014,"While on a business trip, we decided to order from here.  We ordered through the facility we were at and they handled calling in and getting our orders. I got the Chicken Madeira.  This dish consists of pounded chicken breast with some light breading and cheese melted on top with a few stick of asparagus.  The side is a chunky mashed potato dish. Since we didn't eat there, the food got to us a bit cold.  The dish was good though.  The portion was huge.  There were two chicken breasts and I only managed to eat one and half of the mashed potatoes.  Could get a bit overwhelming with all the oil from the cheese. It's Cheesecake Factory.  It's a chain.  Can't expect some fine dining."
Rebecca D.,"Phoenix, AZ",13,119,38,5.0,9/21/2016,Fantastic happy hour spot. Going to the Cheesecake Factory for happy hour is a real weekday treat. From 4 to 6 Monday through Friday you can enjoy drinks and appetizers for $5 each or so. I like the Mojito and the Cosmo too. My husband has had the pink lemonade drink and enjoys that a lot. The real draw here is the food. You can order many of their appetizers which usually run $10-$13 for around $5. The best part is the happy hour burger that my husband always orders. Unlike most places that only have sliders this is a full size burger and fries can be ordered with it for a dollar or two more. He loves it as he can have an adult beverage and a burger and fries for like $12. I enjoy several of the appetizers especially the shrimp spring rolls and the avocado egg rolls. There are other things on the menu I am tempted to try but I keep going back to my favorites. I have dined at the Cheesecake Factory outside of happy hour and it's still really good but happy hour is the way to do it!
Yvonney H.,"Tucson, AZ",66,35,237,3.0,5/19/2015,Valet parking now takes half the entire mall parking (all the restaurant side.)  paying for parking when the entire mall parking lot is 45% full rubs me wrong.  The food was good.
Emily G.,"Chandler, AZ",1159,134,341,4.0,10/27/2013,"I do love the Cheesecake Factory. You can't really go wrong here, Pretty much every dish is gonna be good. I had the Mac & Cheese Burger. FANTASTIC! Just picture a juicy savory burger topped with a patty made of Mac & Cheese. I loved it. My only complaint is the menu is too big! Takes me forever to pick something, Everything sounds soo good. Not a bad problem to have."
Ceaz D.,"Phoenix, AZ",4,48,11,2.0,1/30/2016,If I could do 2 1/2 I would but I can't so I'll go with a solid 2 stars. Food was decent. Good spices and the chicken was tender but more pasta then chicken. Two people spent $85 not all that
S M.,"Phoenix, AZ",1,111,6,5.0,9/24/2016,"Celebrated our birthdays here and were given exceptional service. Walker, the manager went above and beyond!"
Elizabeth T.,"Phoenix, AZ",455,96,87,5.0,4/3/2015,"Love this location. The biltmore is a nice place to stop on my way home from work and I always stop in for at least a piece of cheesecake but the food is great here too. They have so many different options. Mexican, Italian, American delicious."
Rene F.,"Phoenix, AZ",3,63,11,4.0,1/3/2016,"I came for the first time. I would just come for their cheesecakes. I love their cheesecakes. The only reason why I give a 4 star is because of the price of the items listed in the menu. Yes the food is good, but if they knock a few dollars off it would be even be better.  We ordered chips with guacamole dip and it was really good and fresh. I had the macaroni cheeseburger with fries. The place can use just a little more lighting, it's kind of dark. The restrooms were a bit dirty too, something I didn't expect being in the ""biltmore"" area.  I would come again to try other things on their menu."
LBeezy B.,"Phoenix, AZ",3,4,,1.0,9/19/2015,"Just had dinner at The CheeseCake Factory and I can probably tell you it was the worst experience ever; from the nasty floors to the ROACH crawling along OUR the table - REALLY!! The waiter did his best to catch the Roach without success. The waitress apologizes for the floor and the roach. Eventually the manager came over and offered to waive our dessert that we didn't even order. So he wanted us to pay more money for an subpar experience. I can see why this restaurant has three start rating. The restaurant is subpar, the floors are always dirty with food from the last guest and now they have a roach issue and we weren't even compensated correctly for our troubles or just to simply make it as right as possible. For this reason we will probably never return although we live 2 minutes away."
Tim K.,"Avondale, AZ",57,248,15,4.0,1/31/2015,"Good place to spend a rainy afternoon. Ordered the appetizer Nachos with spicy chicken, it was a huge portion. Finished about 1/4 of it and the rest was snacks for later. The clam chowder soup was also a hit.  Simple, good service, good atmosphere, good food, reasonable price, what can be better."
Eric C.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,14,4,4.0,3/25/2016,"Wonderful dinner served on the patio.  The steak Diane was amazing, especially for a chain restaurant.  Anne Marie took exceptional care of us and earned a 25% gratuity for her extraordinary efforts. Thank you Cheesecake Factory!"
Robin W.,"Phoenix, AZ",3,25,,5.0,3/5/2016,"Wonderful atmosphere, wonderful food! Service with a smile and timely. Very good food, we go all the time! Highly recommend!"
A. M.,"San Jose, CA",0,54,9,5.0,2/21/2015,Came here with my family and we were seated outside. After about 10 minutes my brother approached a waiter and he came by and said he's not our waiter but took our order for drinks and appetizers. His name was Raven. Our waitress eventually came by but she was not as nice and attentive as Raven. Throughout the dinner he came by making sure we were taken care of.  He was amazing!  My brother and I ordered the steak Diane and the other two people in our party ordered vegetarian burgers. We also had the ahi tuna tartar and avocado egg rolls for appetizers. The food was very good. Will definitely go back.
Jade T.,"Saint Louis, MO",0,32,7,4.0,8/22/2016,"The cheesecake factory is always good. Because it sells cheesecake. All over this country.  It's the same menu. It's the same great food.  It's the same cheesecake, so what makes one better than another? Why even write a review?   Service.  This cheesecake factory has on hand a young man by the name of John.  He was prompt, polite, funny ( sometimes hard to be both!) , & gave great recommendations.  Made Made what would have been an alright dinner out into a fun dinner out."
Debbie P.,"Phoenix, AZ",8,13,3,5.0,3/23/2016,"Best place ever!! Great food great service. I highly recommended this place. First time I ate in this place I was so amaze how the waitress were on you, no mistake food on tim."
Christopher D.,"Doylestown, PA",165,327,235,3.0,11/19/2014,This review is just for the take out counter. Went in to get cheesecake that would not have nuts in it. Lovely staff were kind enough to walk me through the options. Ended up with a white chocolate blueberry cheesecake. Hit the spot.
