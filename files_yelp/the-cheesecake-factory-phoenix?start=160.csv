Harry R.,"Arecibo, Puerto Rico",5,30,51,5.0,8/23/2013,"Wow what a great restaurant. The gucamole here is absolubly crazy!!! If you love avocado, plates that have it are a must try. ................................................................................................"
maryanne S.,"Scottsdale, AZ",11,136,86,4.0,1/13/2015,"So sue me. 4 stars. It was that good. I feel almost guilty in writing about how delicious the food was and how terrific and professional was the service.  Seriously. John. At the bar. Best service.  Over the holidays I received a $25 gift certificate and used it (!) I was just bowled-over at how great the food and service was. In case it matters: Steak Diane and a big fat Scotch whiskey. Steak was delicious and the ""real"" portion was generous. (scotch whiskey delicious, as always, McCallan in case you wanted to know. ). I know their reputation is for huge portions, but this steak was under $20, delicious and plenty of it.  (My only suggestion is that the mashed potatoes were not creamy enough. They were good but they were not creamy enough. ) IMPRESSIVE!!!   4 STARS!! The tab was reasonable, John at the bar was terrific!   I never thought I'd say this but I'm going back and I'm probably going back a couple times."
Rochelle L.,"Glendale, AZ",0,1,,1.0,8/23/2015,"I went here last night with a party of 23. They do not take reservations. When our group checked in we were told it would be about an hour before our table was ready. We ended up waiting 2 hours for our party to be seated and we had to split our party up in 2 groups and sat on opposite sides of the room. We got 2 complimentary orders of nachos for waiting so long. Service was horrible. They insisted on taking our order a certain way but when the food was delivered, they had no clue who ordered what food. There were 2 servers for our group. One server was scheduled to go home and rushed some of us to pay our bill. They didn't check on how our food was and at the end brought us the bill without even asking if we'd like to order dessert.  I will not be going back to this location again!"
Taylor M.,"Phoenix, AZ",76,268,621,4.0,7/17/2014,"Had the herb crusted salmon / steak dianne combination. They burnt the little medallion steak pieces that were under 1 cm thick. How do you burn tiny pieces of steak like that that only need to be cooked a small amount???  The burnt taste ruined the steak medallions. The salmon was perfect.  Also had Ahi Capaccio and that was delicious, but a bit overpriced for the amount. The strawberry shortcake was not to my liking. The replacement for the soft, moist shortcake cake was this hard crusty, and ultimately soggy crust like pieces. I did not like it one bit.   The server was very good and did a good job, but he was somewhat awkward socially."
Judy L.,"Avondale, AZ",440,1127,1324,4.0,2/6/2011,"I have not been to this location since the last review in 2009!  Well M has been having a horrible 2 weeks.  She picked Cheesecake for lunch, I never say no to Cheesecake!!  We were quickly sitted.  Our server came over quickly to take drink orders...  I had to order the TexMex eggrolls too!   I got the Chicken Alfredo lunch.  It was very good, creamy and the noodles were done perfectly.  Only 1 minor complain, 5 chunks of chicken, REALLY?   Got my usual Vanilla Bean Cheesecake to top off the visit!!!"
Chris G.,"Los Angeles, CA",97,155,26,4.0,8/19/2014,I was just hungry. I ordered the Cajun chicken lil bits. They were not little and the portion size was unbelievable. I can put away some good and there was plenty left for a good lunch.  Gotta love the portion sizes! Bartender was cool as well
Emily S.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,8,1,5.0,8/16/2016,"My son asks the waiters why they don't have any ""fun menus that you draw on"" and the guy was awesome and pulled some paper out and gave him a pen to draw with. Any person that goes out of their way for my child is amazing. I'll update with a name."
David L.,"Fountain Hills, AZ",232,166,548,5.0,10/7/2014,My favorite restaurant. Upset they got rid of the eggplant sandwhich but it's not a big deal they still have plenty of other stuff for me to eat. The waiting time to sit isnt long and worth the wait! Great food with tons of choices and amazing service! I have never been to a cheesecake factory that i didnt like. Oh yeah they have a nice bar for those who drink.
Jimmy Q.,"Phoenix, AZ",1,30,5,5.0,5/29/2014,"It is a corporate chain. The food is consistent across all the restaurants and it is good to excellent depending on what you order from the enormous menu. The skinnylicious offerings are quite good too - sometimes I wonder how they actually lower the calories in these meals (smaller portions and probably higher salt content). We have gone to this location at least a dozen times over the past year. In almost all cases, the service has been excellent. Friendly and attentive. All you would expect. In terms of parking, it's generally easy in the ""token"" lot right in front of the restaurant (2 hours free). If you are going at a busy time, there is additional free parking at the back of the shopping center only a few minutes walk away. There is also valet parking. In terms of the wait, you might experience one depending on when you go. It's a popular place. We try to go just before the busy hours (e.g. 11:45 on a weekend) so we haven't waited more than ten minutes. However, when we leave around 1pm, I can see that there is probably a 15-20 minute wait. Good place for lunch or dinner. We'll keep going back."
Steve V.,"Phoenix, AZ",83,82,2,4.0,11/13/2014,"Cheesecake factory has a lot of things going for it.  Great food, outstanding selection of dishes and appetizers, comfortable ambience, and pretty good service.  I am a fan for sure.  One thing I don't like is whenever they bring you something with a dipping sauce of any kind, they bring it in a tiny dish and you always have to ask for extra.  Okay, maybe I am just a pig and eating too much sauce.....but seriously, would be nice to at least ask ""is that going to be enough sauce or would you like an extra one.""  Anyway, I am nit picking (otherwise I wouldn't be much of a critic), but the place is great on all other fronts!  Well done gang. Steve"
Ariana A.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,1,,1.0,8/15/2015,Wait is longer than indicated - no reservations. Hosts do not acknowledge or update you.
Chris S.,"Tempe, AZ",298,569,1415,2.0,5/14/2012,"Normally I never visit chains as I detest them, but on a Sunday night Mother's Day, there really was nowhere else to go. It was either between this place and Red Devil and I wish we just would have went to Red Devil instead. They do not take reservations but we were pleasantly surprised to find that the wait was non-existent on this night and we were seated right away. The waiter took our drink orders and my sister was the only one that didn't want lemon in her drink and he was kinda rude about that, something about making his job more difficult or something but whatever. The menu is huge and they have a Skinnylicious menu that features light menu items if you are watching your weight.  Pretty much anything that you could want is on the menu; italian, asian, american, etc. and let's not forget that cheesecake! The cheesecake is the one item where you cannot go wrong. OMG Red Velvet layer cheesecake is 7.95 a slice as they are all aptly priced but it is a huge slice enough for two people.  The mango passion tea is great as were their mixed drinks which are $9.25++ I got the veggie burger which was okay, nothing groundbreaking in flavor or toppings, sauces etc. The fries were a bit disappointing and the food presentation was pretty disappointing and lackluster. My mom got a turkey burger that was incredibly greasy and she was not happy with it. She asked the waiter if he was sure if it was a turkey burger and he assured her it was but again, did not get her something else or offer to take it off of the bill. So somewhat disappointing considering this is Mother's Day and I wanted my mom to at least enjoy her meal. Summary: Food so-so-may change on a variable basis, Service-abyssmal, we never even got our water glasses refilled, another waitress stepped on my sister's foot but refused to move in a timely manner. I'm going to have to pass on this one unless I need cheesecake in the near future. The validated parking is free with a two hour limit."
Sharon G.,"Gaithersburg, MD",204,276,106,4.0,3/9/2013,"I KNOW I wrote a long, detailed review after my last birthday experience here in December of 2012. So where is it? Who deleted it??? My friend took me here for my birthday at my request. I was craving avocado poppers so I ordered that and ...hmmm now I can't remember what I ordered, but it was probably steak. My initial review was much more detailed, including a review of our waiter, but I have forgotten the details."
Jasmine C.,"Phoenix, AZ",175,853,,2.0,8/4/2012,"Why do people eat here?  It was packed on a Thursday night.  We had to eat in the bar to avoid a 20 minute wait to be seated.  Everything on the menu is SOOO Expensive.  The only reason we stayed and ate is we had a $50 gift card. Wanted to order something eat that we could share while having our cocktails.  The waitress could not recommend or guarantee anything that was gluten free.  So I just ate all the free bread and butter they brought and then we ordered dessert.  He got the ice cream sundae and I had a lemoncello raspberry cheesecake or something like that.  The waitress recommended it.  It wasn't very good at all.  I only ate a few bites because I didn't want to waste eating that many calories on something not so tasty. With three cocktails (A mojito for me and 2 gin and tonics for him), the sundae and slice of cheesecake, with tip was $45).  I think that is quite a bit. The best part was the free bread, no joke.  Service was pretty horrid as well."
Jude M.,"Gulfport, MS",4,12,21,4.0,11/5/2015,"I had the Louisiana Chicken Pasts and it was delicious as usual. Being from Louisiana this dish lives up to its name (considering this is a chain restaurant).  With its large portion size, this dish can definitely be shared if you aren't super hungry.  I definitely recommend the sweet corn tamales for an appetizer. Parking here can get a little complicated but the staff and service more than makes up for any parking inconvenience."
David L.,"Phoenix, AZ",170,327,1173,3.0,7/29/2012,"I don't know what to think about this house. I remember reading in Mens Health that this restaurant serves up a heavy portion, high caloric fatty foods. But the cheesecake on the marquee drew me in. I was dining with my daughter and have a tendency to try to fatten up my kids, to no avail and to be fair there is a SkinnyLicious Menu. I ordered up the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta. Shrimp and chicken sauteed with onions, tomato and peppers in a very spicy Cajun sauce on top of fresh linguine. $17. Certainly a heavy plate, delicious and took home half of it for someone else in the family. My drink was a Stella Artois 22 oz. $7.25 The kid got a marinara pasta. $11.50 We came for the cheesecake. Kahlua cocoa coffee $7. and the fresh strawberry  $7.50. I ate half of mine. It was so good."
Mike S.,"Phoenix, AZ",9,33,,3.0,8/27/2015,Went with my wife for the first time. I guess it's ok for a company franchise. The food was great and the service was better.
Noor B.,"Phoenix, AZ",124,428,53,3.0,1/3/2014,"The Cheesecake Factory is such a mixed bag of good and bad. There's almost always a wait if you have a party larger than 2, even if the restaurant is empty. I don't know if they are understaffed or if there are tons many people visiting on a daily basis. Either way, call ahead if possible. This particular location has a valet, but you can easily park around the mall and walk a couple minutes if you want to save a few bucks. Servers are friendly and attentive. Restaurant is nice, big, clean - kind of reminds me of a Vegas casino. I really like the rye bread - it's soft and sweet. White bean hummus is a nice twist on classic hummus, although I think the accompanying bread was a bit stale. No biggie. I just wish I had ordered a different entree. I got the Chinese chicken salad, which is a stupid choice given their huge menu of American and European dishes. The salad tasted like the Asian chicken salad from Wendy's, but with a bunch of rice noodles on top. Sure, it's a big salad, but not worth the $14.50 I paid for it. Like I said, my own fault - order at your own risk! The crispy chicken costoletta was actually good. Once again, big portion, and the chicken was really nice. Mashed potatoes seemed a bit tired, and the asparagus was nothing fancy. Still, it was good, and I wouldn't mind ordering it in the future. I think the food here is good, not outstanding, and I do think it's overpriced. I wouldn't mind eating here again but it'll be awhile before I do."
Nora M.,"Tempe, AZ",19,171,193,5.0,7/8/2015,"I went for lunch during birthday week, my lunch mates got salmon- big and looked awesome!  I tasted the fettuccine  alfredo- much too garlicky  and I like garlic! I had the luau chicken- perfect and this time they had pineapple  upside  cheesecake,  hooray!! Awesome"
Christina S.,"Phoenix, AZ",12,11,,5.0,11/22/2015,"Who doesn't love The Cheesecake?  You have 100 things to chose from. Portions are huge. I've never had a bad meal there. Tonight,  Parmasean herb crusted chicken. Was it good? Ate the whole thing!"
