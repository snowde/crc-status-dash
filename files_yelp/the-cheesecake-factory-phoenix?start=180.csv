Vanessa T.,"Peoria, AZ",0,9,,5.0,11/18/2015,What is there not to like about this place? They have a menu for everyone! I love how they have all different types of food! The orange chicken is one of my favorite meals!! Must try!
Raymond R.,"Phoenix, AZ",40,8,,5.0,11/16/2015,The snickers cheescake is heaven I love eating dinner here because the food is great and the customer service is what I look for in a good restaurant
Amy B.,"Rochester, MI",547,1180,306,5.0,1/12/2012,"I love the Cheesecake Factory, and cannot say enough good things about them!  I've never been to this specific location before, but have been to a few others in the valley, and I love it every single time I go.  Weather its for lunch or dinner, with family, friends or coworkers, this place hits the spot every single time. Their menu is huge, and awesome!  TONS of great food to choose from. Dinners, lunches, and it all tastes so good!  MMM.  Lunch specials, dinners, deserts you can find everything on their huge menu.  The restaurant is quite large as well so seating is plentiful.   Today I went with my coworker during lunch, and we both walked out so full!  We got pasta lunch specials, and it was Delicious.  We were seated within a few minutes of entering, and our waitress greeted us and took our order.  She brought out bread which was hot and tasty, which we devoured.  Drinks were always filled, and we were in and out in a little more then an hour.  I got the spagetti with meat sauce, and the lunch sized one was HUGE.  I will be having leftovers for dinner, trust me! I will be returning here in the future, trust me.  Menu and food is amazing, love the atmosphere, etc.   I will say, on a side note the parking here has gotten WORSE over past few years.  I will not blame Cheesecake factory because its not their private lot, but its bad.  When I first started coming to this district, parking was open and free, with some valet service.  Then, one day, I came here last year to eat, and it was all chopped up into different pay lots.  the first lots a valet, the next lot is all token pay parking, theirs a pay parking structure in the back, and tons of ""15 minute to go"" parking around the perimeter of the center.  UM, this is a nightmare to navigate!  There's ""free"" parking but they shove you way in the back on the ""north"" side of the lot and you would spend at least 15 minutes walking to cheesecake factory if you were to have parked on that side of the mall. My advice?  Either circle 3 million times, or just drop your car off in the token paying lot down the way.  I think Cheesecake factory may even validate, but that's my thoughts... Anyways, I love you cheesecake factory and you have never failed me! MUAH!"
Erica N.,"Goodyear, AZ",101,37,65,5.0,4/23/2014,"Never, ever disappointed!  Great selection across the board! If you can't find something you like on this vast menu, I feel sorry for you.  Love the skinny menu, cocktail choices,  and of course. ...desserts!!! Favorite pineapple upside down cheesecake, phenomenal!   Love the decor, lighting, knowledgeable staff, and accomodating management."
Emma H.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,21,,4.0,10/22/2015,"Well, I'll be blunt. The food is decent, and their charming array of different types of cheesecake is delicious. When friends and I go, we mostly go for the cheesecake--after all, that's what the place is named for. I have never had a bad cheesecake. I was once a little disappointed in a dish I got, but all the other times have been pretty pleasant. Customer service is pretty good. When it got buys we waited a really long time to get our check, but you can't really blame them for that."
Rosslyn F.,"Glendale, AZ",0,9,,4.0,11/11/2014,"The menu is large, so if you'v never been to a Cheesecake Factory before, I recommend looking through an online version of the menu before you go so you aren't as overwhelmed deciding what you'd like when you actually get there. The service at this location is amazing.  The staff is extremely polite and very accommodating.  My beverage was never empty, and anything we needed, was provided (including plastic-ware for our to-go cheesecake). For having such a large menu, I am surprised at how well they prepare each dish.  My table had the Fettuccine Alfredo (which needed a little pepper) and the teriyaki chicken (which was very delicious).  Right now there seasonal pumpkin cheesecake is available.  It is the best pumpkin cheesecake I have ever had!  I would also recommend their oreo cheesecake! Just a warning: this restaurant is very dimly lit at night (makes for a romantic meal if you manage to get a booth).  I do not recommend eating here if your party includes someone with failing eyesight unless you bring a little light for them to use to see the menu."
Greg H.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,2,,1.0,10/11/2015,We were told they had pumpkin cheesecake so we stayed to have dinner.  After we ate the LA Chicken Pasta they informed us they did not have any pumpkin cheesecake.  They lied to us to have us stay.  Not coming back
Priya R.,"Phoenix, AZ",4,49,36,5.0,7/9/2015,We ordered for the chicken potstickers and flat bread for the appetizers and they were really good . Their bread basket has some of the best samplers around ! They have huge portions of everything and the menu in itself is like a booklet with whole lot of selections . Linda's cream cake and the lemon meringue cheesecake for deserts were divine ! With such good food and ambience the price has all the reasons to be on the higher side . Hello .. Whose complaining !!
Mya T.,"Scottsdale, AZ",105,352,14,4.0,10/15/2013,"Great location and if you go for lunch on the weekends the parking is super easy, despite the weird token system they have at the Biltmore. The waitstaff is always friendly, glasses are never empty, and they are willing to explain any item on the menu."
Ken L.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,10,1,5.0,12/24/2014,"The other day, i took my holiday guests to share dinner at yourBiltmore location. My friends had arrived from Paris and were famished. I chose your establishment because of the extensive selection of menu items and the quality of food. It was approximately 5pm and we decided to enjoy our meal on the patio where it was relatively quiet.  Upon entering the restaurant, we were greeted promptly and seated immediately. I was concerned because I didn't see anyone else eating on the patio which typically means the server sometimes can forget they have people outside. Our table was clean, music was at an acceptable level, the sunscreens were pulled down and everything seemed perfect, then...our waitress arrived and introduced herself as Nikea. At that precise moment, our experience began to change.  Granted, had been shopping all day. My guests were experiencing jet lag from their travels. Their English is not that great which required translation and patience just to get through the menu. The four of us were hungry, but we just couldn't believe nor did we ever expect what happened next. Nikea created an environment which made us feel as though we were being welcomed in her own home. Not once did we ever feel rushed nor did we feel like red headed step children for sitting on the patio. She had other tables on the inside  but somehow knew when we needed drinks or her assistance. She made reasonable suggestions and was present for our entire meal.  Although we had just met, she created an atmosphere in which I felt as though I had known her for quite some time. One might ask what exactly did she do?  Everything. Absolutely everything was perfect and exceeded my own expectations this making taking our dining experience from perfect to a remarkably extraordinary epic experience! If she isn't part of your training crew, I would highly recommend you consider making her one. Her mannerisms, attentiveness and overall professionalism was superb, but it was her personality which boosted her A game and placed a personal touch on our experience. I truly hope you take the time to share this with her. Thank you Nikea for a remarkably relaxing and memorable dining experience. Entertains guests from foreign countries who have limited knowledge of the English language is very exhausting and sometimes stressful. Thank you for making this an amazing dinner for me and my guests.  And if you are reading this to her, I hope you give her a great big hug for me right now. You absolutely put the ""awe"" in Awesome!"
Ree S.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,31,2,5.0,6/29/2015,"Great happy hour ! We ordered cheesy garlic bread, chicken sliders , avocado rolls and cosmos.  Everything so good.  Great service fresh great food.  Party of three we had lots of fun!  Last we ordered cheesecake banana cream cheesecake yum so good."
Mahmoud E.,"Castro Valley, CA",50,177,69,4.0,4/13/2014,"Came here for dinner with friends, had the shrimp scampi and steak Diane, firecracker salmon for appetizer.  Very good steak, medium rare like I ordered. Firecracker salmon was nothing special, good to try but I don't think I'll order it again. The shrimp scampi was good. All in all would I come here for dinner again, maybe, but I'll definitely come here for the ambiance and oh let's not forget the cheesecake.  The best ever!!"
Jesus D M.,"Peoria, AZ",1,7,1,4.0,1/1/2014,"I heard about Cheesecake Factory from ""The Big Bang"" TV Show, so when I went there my first time, I was expecting something different, but since my arrival everything was amazing, I loved the place, the service n the food...since then I keep coming back to try n enjoy new dishes :)"
John B.,"Scottsdale, AZ",1,4,,2.0,4/19/2016,"I have been going to this location for years and never had problems until recently.  One one occasion I ordered the chicken piccata.  I was given chicken Alfredo.  I sent it back and it came out very quickly, the kitchen added lemon and capers to the Alfredo.  WRONG!  Again it went back and this time I got a reasonable facsimile of a piccata.  The next time I went in the bartender Chelsea ignored me for almost 20 minutes.  When she finally did come over she was rude and treated me like a second class subhuman piece of trash.  Today I went back and Chelsea was working again.  I had just returned from a hiking trip with friends and sat in the back of a Jeep for six hours.  I just wanted to have a drink and relax while I waited for an Uber to pick me up.  Unfortunately Chelsea's girlfriend was sitting at the bar and didn't shut up from the moment I walked in to the moment I left.  I'm not saying it's wrong to have friends come in when your working and everyone has the right to express themselves but there is a limit and boundaries need to be set.  Sorry Cheesecake Factory, you had your three strikes!"
Becky P.,"Glendale, AZ",0,19,5,2.0,5/19/2015,"The food is alright, just typical chain restaurant food. I usually get the Louisiana chicken pasta which always has a lot of flavor. Sometimes it comes like it's been sitting out for a while because all the sauce has settled to the bottom and left a greasy film on top. My beef with this chain is their portion sizes. They're insane. Like, not even the hulk could finish a plate of pasta from here. I feel like they give you a huge plate of food just so they can justify charging $17 for bow tie pasta and paper thin pieces of fried chicken. CF is just a corporate restaurant at its finest. Nothing special."
Cynthia A.,"Phoenix, AZ",6,30,18,5.0,3/22/2015,"Their chocolate tuxedo cheesecake is chocolatey, creamy and moist it is truly the best. Service is fast, friendly enjoyed my experience here."
Michael F.,"Mesa, AZ",1135,929,3586,5.0,3/10/2011,"I love taking my mom out every month to have lunch or dinner.  Since it was Ash Wednesday and the start of lent, I decided to take her to the Cheesecake Factory for meatless meals.  I've eaten here several times and I've never had a bad dish here. We enjoyed a couple of small appetizers first and I ordered the corn fritters and a plate of stuffed mushrooms. The meals came with a basket full of complimentary breads. For small plates, they sure give you a lot. I was getting full just from eating the appetizers.  We also ordered the shrimp platter, breaded salmon, mashed potatoes, asparagus and washed them down with Raspberry Lemonade. For dessert, we got the white chocolate macadamia cheese cake. OMG.......Heaven. Totally scrumptious.  I felt like a total heifer and if I eat here everyday, my booty is going to get huge!  But this is one of my mom's favorite places, so whatever mom wants she gets.  Service was excellent as always plus our waiter was super cute!  ."
Jeff S.,"Happy Valley, OR",60,500,163,5.0,9/27/2011,"Just some preface, I gave this location a 5 star mainly based on comparison with it's counterparts in California. I love Cheesecake factory. I like their appetizers, their pastas, their entre's. In California, I've been to the one in San Jose, Irvine, and San Diego. The food is always about the same (good), the line always long (hour), and the service is always mediocre ( too busy to be attentive, professional enough not to make it an issue). This location was nothing like this in a good way ( maybe cuz it's not CA?) 1. The food was excellent. My party had:  - Pasta Da Vinci - Great  - Wings - Good  - Tuna Tartar Appetizer small plate - good 2. Service was amazing. My drink never even got halfway down, every few minutes someone checked up on us, wow.... 3. No wait. None. Walked right in... I don't think I've ever seen that happen... Amazing. I know how I say I hate reviewing franchises, but wow, good food, no wait, great service...."
audrey e.,"Phoenix, AZ",125,22,25,1.0,2/22/2015,Food wasn't prepared properly and when I asked for them to prepare it again it was horrible! Very disappointed and won't return to this location!
Fritz G.,"River Forest, IL",57,54,,3.0,10/17/2013,"As always, you can expect the huge menu at the Cheesecake Factory. And, as always, the food is consistently good. Not great, but good."
