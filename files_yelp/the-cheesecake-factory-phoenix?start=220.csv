Connor C.,"Winston-Salem, NC",4,43,13,3.0,8/29/2015,"great place for a fancy dinner after a day at the county fair.  so much food, no room for cheesecake.  everything is really intense.  our server was nice enough, but maybe a little bit off (mentally)."
Mario M.,"Phoenix, AZ",5,14,3,5.0,10/19/2014,"I met friends at CF for dinner last night. Our table had the mini hot dogs, the sliders (mini burgers), meatloaf, chicken buffalo sandwich, chicken littles, Ahi tartar and the dumplings . Aria was our server and took care of us (even though we can tell she wasn't feeling well). She maintained the table's needs (refills, etc) with very little interruption. For dessert we had the Lemon Meringue which has become my favorite cheesecake. Good experience, food and its price and of course the cheesecake!"
Sai P.,"Scottsdale, AZ",40,27,34,1.0,2/16/2013,"We came out on a Saturday night. We understand it is busy and there is going to be a wait. We checked in with our name, party of two, was told it was going to be about a 30 min wait, got our pager, and waited outside since the lobby/foyer was crowded. There were a few parties waiting outside too.  40 minutes have passed, we came inside and checked to see the status of where our name was. Apparently our pager was dead, they called our name 10-15 minutes ago. We were put off by the manager/supervisor's attitude, he was really rude.  He made it seem like it was our fault we didn't hear our names called because we were standing right outside and that our pager was dead. I saw that they were calling names inside and outside, but the only called outside every other time.  This kind customer service at the beginning set the mood for the evening...not fun. We always try to have a positive attitude, but it was kind of sad when someone that is representing the restaurant is not welcoming, we didn't really want to be there anymore. We stayed though because we are not rude.  They did seat us about a minute after. Our waiter was awkward too, but he tried.  We always like to come out here to have our favorite appetizer and dessert. We live 30 min away, so we like to make night of it when we decide to come out."
Ruth Ann M.,"Scottsdale, AZ",18,53,14,3.0,1/12/2013,"I haven't been to a CF in several years and never in AZ. Last night, my BF and I went to the one in the Camelback Corridor and we were both pleasantly surprised.  My memories of CFs from back East were tons of mediocre food and great desserts. This time, however, we had very nice appetizers--avocado eggroll, samosas, and beet and goat cheese salad. My main course, the spicy chicken salad, was tasty.  The appetizer portions are generous, the main course not so overwhelming and the dessert? Too stuffed to eat it so we took it home to  have tonight! But how can it go wrong for dulce de leche cheesecake?  I would go back except that I know I will be tempted to try other restaurants in the area particularly the ones that aren't corporate-owned and have more interesting menus. That said, the few items we tried from CF's menu were A-OK. I'll probably take my son there for brunch sometime."
Cory M.,"Phoenix, AZ",1,6,,1.0,5/3/2015,"Our server Georgina, took our drink orders and left. When she returned, she had forgotten to bring a tea for one of our party. Moments later, holding a tray with a cleaning rag on it, she dropped the tray just beside me and splashed both myself, and my friend sitting next to me. I absorbed most of the splatter, in my mouth, left eye, and face. She fortunately was only splashed on her body and hand. Georgina didn't even say anything to us, but picked up the tray and kept going. After a few moments of waiting, I got up and went to the restroom to clean myself off, since I didn't even have a place setting or napkin at the table. On the way back, I stopped and asked to speak with a manager. A young man with curly hair, and square framed glasses was brought to me and didn't give me his name. I told him our situation, and what had happened. I told him I could not only smell, but also taste the cleaning solution that had been on the rag and tray. At first I asked if it was bleach based, and he assured me it wasn't. Then he said he'd talk to our server, and left things at that by turning around to talk to the hostesses. Clearly, I was dismissed. So I returned to the table, disgusted, upset, and smelling of cleaning solution. My appetite was ruined at this point, so I choose not to order anything. Having chemicals splashed into your mouth, even a few droplets, will do that to a person. At this point, our friend STILL hadn't received his iced tea. We flagged down a passing server and asked her if she could bring it for him. She went back, and came out with the wrong tea. Now in this, I say it wasn't really her fault. She wasn't our server, and didn't know what type he had asked for. Correcting that issue was minor. Next up, comes our long wait for our orders to be brought out. Georgina hasn't been back to our table for at least 15 minutes at this point. Another young man stopped and dropped one basket of bread and a small dish with 4 butter pats, to serve a group of 7. Another long wait, and the table next to us, who were seated after us, and ordered after us, gets their meals. At this point, my left eye was feeling irritated, and I went to flush it out in the men's room with water as best I could. When I returned to the table, our orders were just coming out. And my roommates order was wrong. He had ordered the garlic noodles with shrimp, and NO asparagus. And he got asparagus mixed into all his noodles. At this point, he notified the food runner who had brought his dish that it was wrong. The young man said sorry, and then walked away without offering to replace or fix the order. he decided to just pick out the asparagus, and deal with it since he was hungry, and didn't feel like waiting another 30 minutes. At this point, Georgina has appeared at our table 4 times total. While refilling glassing, she is reaching directly in front of my roommates mothers face, my face, and our friend seated on the other side of the booth. No excuse me, no words at all, and STILL no apology from her for the splashing. While my friends ate, I again went to the restroom to flush my eye. I again stopped to speak with the manager from earlier, and asked him for the name of the chemical used for cleaning. He immediately told me that ""I already told you sir that we do not use bleach products here."" He furthermore told me that he had spoken to our server, and she said she didn't have any cleaning solution or rags with her when she dropped her tray. Outright calling me a liar as I see things. Please take into account, from the beginning I told the manager I didn't want anything, and wasn't asking for free meals, or drinks, or desert etc. I simply wanted the name of the chemicals used, so that I could give that information to a doctor if I felt the need to seek out treatment. He informed me that they didn't use chemicals for cleaning, and then said they used a sanitation solution. I'm sorry, but that would be a chemical. I pointed that out, and told him I was very upset with how this had all been handled. I made it clear again, that I wasn't looking for anything from him, except the name of the chemical. He asked if there was anything he could do to make my evening better, covering my meal or anything. I once more told him that I had chosen NOT to eat, after getting splashed and having that rancid taste of chemicals in my mouth. He then said he would get me the name of the solution used, after my having exhausted every other avenue, and telling him I would be contacting the corporate office. At this point, I told him I was done with the conversation, and wanted nothing more to do with him, as he clearly didn't care about the situation. The rest of our evening was spent with little service from Georgina. She had come and taken a desert order from our group while I was speaking with the manager, without even asking if I had wanted anything. Granted, I didn't. She didn't speak a word to me the entire time after the first complaint, and treated"
Shirley V.,"Vancouver, Canada",46,186,4,4.0,8/29/2012,"It is located in a very fancy mall which is quite nice to visit. You have valley parking which impressed me, as the restaurant by itself isn't expensive. The food was good, I got a burger wrapped in lettuce leaves, it was tasty and the pattie was cooked as I asked. My BF got a beautiful and tasty dish of salmon and prawns with a tasty mashed potato. Simple dish but was executed nicely. The price was good and as I am gluten intolerant I couldn't taste their cheesecake (I was sad, cos they look amazing). Je veux manger mon cheesecake !!"
Debi C.,"Gilbert, AZ",18,45,3,1.0,2/27/2014,"I was having lunch today with two business executives.  I ordered a Chinese Chicken Salad which seemed simple enough. When it was served I began to eat it and noticed there was no chicken.  I politely asked if I had ordered wrong and she said ""no"" the chicken might be on the bottom. I checked, no chicken. I again brought it to her attention and she said she had to show the kitchen to be sure that I was correct.  She then proceeds to take my salad that I had been tossing around to the kitchen .  They  go through it and she brings the same salad back saying ""yea, you were right they forgot it, they laughed and added some for you"". I would have thought they would have made a new one not played with mine and add chicken to fix it.  I chose not to eat it after others have handled it. I didn't want take it further  because I was with others.  But.... Cheesecake, I was embarrassed enough for us all. Worst service ever!  And an attitude I was shocked by!  I  sure the other people I was with will not return there anytime soon. There are a lot of great places to go at the Biltmore and Cheesecake if no longer one of our choices."
Devin J.,"Orlando, FL",4,41,53,5.0,3/5/2015,John is the best bartender!!! Always has a great attitude  and gives great service. He can pretty much make any drink that you want. Best time to visit are his shifts Monday  thru Friday for those people who like to sit at the bar.
Amy B.,"Albuquerque, NM",25,107,8,5.0,4/7/2014,"The Cheesecake Factory is a treat, since my hometown doesn't have one.  Everything ordered was cooked perfectly, and the best part was the service.  I wish we had one in Albuquerque!!"
Brooks S.,"Phoenix, AZ",66,49,1,3.0,9/30/2011,This is pretty much like all the other locations.   The service was fine.  I didn't care for the snarky comments from the waiter about the amount of water I drink.
Tam F.,"San Ramon, CA",489,1397,253,3.0,6/9/2009,"I went to Phoenix to spend time with my Grandmother. She is going to be 86 this year and has been having a bunch of health problems so when I told her I would be coming to town, she asked if I would take her to see her financial planner who works in this area. He is great and often drives all the way to Sun City West to see her or they conduct business over the phone and email. Since it is schlep for my mom to do this, I was happy to take her. We had an appointment around 1:15 and since Gram moves a bit slower than either of us expected, our plan to have lunch before the appointment didn't work out so we had lunch afterward. This is how we ended up at CF. She was starving and knew they had a lot of options and she didn't feel like Miracle Mile (and I knew I could eat at the one in Arrowhead) Cheesecake Factory is CF. I know now that I like their burgers and I love their garden salad. It is full of great veggies like shredded zuchini and beets. Gram had the meatloaf and ate about 3/4 and then decided it wasn't as good as it used to be. I refused to let her send it back (one of her favorite things to do-eat more than half and then complain so she gets either a comped meal or another meal that she takes home for another time)-yes,I am outing her trick and she knows I am on to her.... She let me pay because I didn't let her send her food back. Luckily and our waitress was a doll who totally got it. She was from San Jose so we had a good time chatting about the Bay Area and the differences between here and there.  The reason why I am not giving this location 4 stars is because the slice of cheesecake we ordered had some nasty strawberries on it. I have a good taster and when I bit into one it was like biting into an overly acidic chemical taste. I told the waitress and she brought us a plain slice. The waitress told the manager who came over to tell me that NO ONE had ever complained about the strawberries before. I told him to taste one and he looked at me like I was crazy. A few minutes later, our waitress came to me to tell me that the manager did taste the strawberries and that I was right -DUH. Had he come back to tell me this himself, he would have bumped up the star rating in service... Gram said she likes the location in the Arrowhead area better, though we did have a good time talking about all the changes in Phoenix and the Biltmore area."
Tom T.,"Phoenix, AZ",21,38,,5.0,6/11/2015,Great service and our server Gregario was amazing.  We tried to stump him with items on the menu but he was able to give great detail about the items as well as page numbers.
Maggie H.,"Phoenix, AZ",2,12,18,4.0,5/14/2014,"I celebrated my 21st birthday with a group of my friends and boyfriend! Service was great, definitely try the club sandwich!! I have extras and they taste better a second time! In honor of my birthday, I ordered the strawberry daiquiri and it was just...strong but so good! Rule of thumb for the drink: take some of the strawberry as you drink it! I made the mistake of dropping it in and smudging it to get more strawberry out of it, but after eating the big chunks I realized it should have been nibbled while drinking! Awesome time!"
Kathleen H.,"Tempe, AZ",1,15,6,5.0,8/2/2014,"I can't get over the snickers cheesecake, yum!!! My glass was never empty and the food was delicious! I always make it a point to stop by here when I'm in the area."
Kim D.,"Phoenix, AZ",6,197,13,3.0,4/21/2014,"FOOD WAS pretty GOOD and kind of had Italian modern inside decour. Menu is huge with something for everyone to prob like, including a recent light fare menu. nice mood lighting and service was ok. MY COMPLAINT WAS WITH THE CHEESECAKE. not the best cheesecake, yes there's variety but not noteworthy. It has nothing on NY cheesecake or homemade. If you're called the cheesecake factory you better have damn good cheesecake."
Corey H.,"Phoenix, AZ",1,15,,1.0,7/6/2013,"$7 per slice for a Cheesecake? Okay that's understandable for being at the most expensive commercial real estate on 24st & Camelback in Phoenix.  What is not excusable is the Moroccan Chicken. The only reason I got in my car a blew $30 on a meal on take out, is because of a video showing how delicious it was. What I got from this location was nothing short of horrible. It looked nothing like what I saw in the video, and on top of that the chicken was so dry I had to chase it down with water just to swallow it. It did not matter that they were generous, giving 3 breasts with the meal, because I could not finish even one. Since I hate wasting food I gave it to my 3 cats, but they would not even eat it, and they love chicken! I would not have even written this review because I hate bashing businesses, but this place refused to answer my email complaint about the bad meal. At least answer and acknowledge you read it. Next time I'll just go down the road to Chili's. At least they try.."
Alicia G.,"Phoenix, AZ",29,11,1,4.0,4/11/2014,Always the best options!!!!! I get the louisiana chicken pasta every time!!!! I've only tried a couple other plates but this one is always my number one choose! I recommend it to any pasta lover!  Yuummmmmmm!!!!!
K G.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,23,1,1.0,3/27/2016,"We decided to go have our Easter dinner at the cheesecake factory tonight and I wish we wouldn't have.  Right away our server messed up the appetizer order, ok it happens, not too big of a deal. But it got messed up a second time. Then when our dinner was brought out the server never came back till everyone was almost done. My dinner was not good and I wanted to get something else. But I had to sit while my family are waiting for our server to come back. When she finally did, she questioned me on why I didn't like my food and if I had ever had it before....I had actually had it many times and was one of my favorite things. She became very rude after all that. Didn't bother apologizing. I had to wait another 15/20 min after everyone was done eating and paid for my meal to come out. The one thing that made this experience has was the rudeness of our server Alexandria T. I'm a server and I think one of the most important thing is to check back with your table to make sure everyone is happy. This could've been different if she had done that. At my restaurant when there's a problem, a manager always comes to the table....no manager bothered to talk to us. Very disappointing"
Marty H.,"Phoenix, AZ",2,11,,1.0,3/19/2015,Parking is impossible so they provide Ameripark valet. No mention of cost. $7 for  a 45 minute lunch!  I found both Cheesecake Factory and Ameripark failed to openly and accurately describe this arrangement. I was deceived and ripped off. BEWARE!
