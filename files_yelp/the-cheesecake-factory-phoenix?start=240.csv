Heather B.,"Peoria, AZ",129,98,38,4.0,7/12/2011,"When I am in the area, I like to frequent this Cheesecake Factory for lunch. I always try to go early or late, but never right at noon. This location is nestled between plenty of office buildings and if you go right at noon, there will surely be a wait.  Today I got the same great food and service! After glancing at the novel-sized menu and wrestling in my mind what to have... I had my usual: the shrimp and bacon club sandwich. I always order mine without the middle slice of bread. There are few reasons why I do this: 1. I can't fit the double decker sandwich in my mouth 2. it makes the sandwich more packed full of shrimp and bacon! 3. Less calories - which I guess makes up for the bacon and fries I had! All in all the sandwich was delish! They have a new nifty metal fry holder that kept my fries hot, too!"
Misty F.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,24,,2.0,8/15/2014,"The front desk girl a few different times wasn't friendly at all.  The food is good but portions are small.  If it weren't for the hostess that never smiles I would rate more stars.  Hostess should be welcoming , accommodating and friendly.  For they are the first person you see when you enter.    Great fried zucchini though !!"
Xuankieu T.,"Phoenix, AZ",12,127,10,3.0,4/28/2013,"I'm writing this review because I try their Cajun Jambalaya Pasta and it was delicious, but that's pretty much it. I order cold apple cider and it was not cider, it was more like apple juice and not cold at all. Their price for their 'small plates' is pricey for the portion that you get, very small."
Kira R.,"Phoenix, AZ",5,40,16,1.0,1/13/2015,"I had an awful experience in November. I called the manager the following day and explained why we had a bad time, from the unorganized servers (multiple servers), to the repeating of everything we need (like water refill 3x), to the fact that the sever had a towel in his back pocket and rubbed across my pasta because he forgot to put in our appetizer salad so we got our pasta and salad at the same time I had pushed my pasta to the side and because the tables are way too close. Todd, the manager said he'd send us a gift card but that it would take some time because it comes from California then he'd mail it to me. So I waited and waited fast forward to January and I speak with Tracy, another manager allowing them to try to fix this one more time before I write a review and she was very friendly said she'd get back with me and she did, she let me know that the person in corporate doesn't work weekends (because I called on a Saturday) I was fine with that but here we are on Tuesday and still no word."
Bao H.,"Scottsdale, AZ",1018,797,1760,3.0,12/13/2010,"Chapter 1 - Appetizers, point is; I don't need an encyclopedia of the world's cuisine on one menu.  I'm hungry and tell me what you serve and are your signature dish - that's all I want.  As you can see I'm not a big fan of restaurants with more on their menu than the number of mistresses of Tiger Woods (Ouch! Sorry Tiger you left yourself open for that one!).  Regardless, I always appreciate the service at the Factory.  Food-wise, I'm generally lost after chapter 2 - Side Salad or Soup?  I just close my eyes and choose and sometimes I win and sometimes, well better luck!  The ambience of the Factory is always pleasing - loud and dark almost like a rollercoaster in Space Mountain except I'm not screaming my head off - Enjoy!"
David K.,"Phoenix, AZ",7,7,3,1.0,2/15/2014,This is the story me and my family where sited  outside we have waited 22 minutes to be exact and we did not get serves the beast part is that after 16 minutes I talked to the hostess and still no one showed up
Gidget S.,"Southgate, MI",58,85,47,4.0,9/22/2013,"This was my first time at a Cheesecake Factory and I was pleasantly surprised. I had this idea that I it was a burger joint, but I was wrong.  I had creamy chicken pasta with sun dried  tomatoes. It was good, but too heavy of a meal for me.   The Oreo cheesecake was wonderful! I don't typically get near cheesecake, but it was fantastic!"
Stuart F.,"Phoenix, AZ",17,13,32,3.0,1/13/2011,"In general I stay away from chains. But a few days ago i had a good meal at cheesecake. It was no French Laundry but that is not what you expect going in.  All our food was correct (the table had many modifications) and everyone enjoyed the food. Everyone knows the menu can be very overwhelming.  I have read books small then it.  But was a group is gives variety .      The following was ordered: Beets with Goat Cheese (Small Plates and Snacks) = the greens where bright and fresh. Grilled Chicken Tostada Salad (Salads) = over-sized, a good mix of chicken, greens, and crunch.   Carne Asada Skirt Steak (Steaks & Chops) = build your own tacos anyone? that is what you get here.     The service on a busy weeknight was very good also."
Jennifer G.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,3,,1.0,1/19/2011,"I can't review the food here because we never got seated! Knowing that Cheesecake Factory doesn't take reservations, my sister called Saturday afternoon to find out how long it would take a party of 14 to be seated that night. The hostess told her she'd take the name, asked my sister to call 20 minutes ahead to let her know we were on our way and our table would be ready shortly after we arrived, if not when we got there. Sounds perfect right? Not so much.  We called them as requested and were told our table would be ready when we arrived. When we arrived about 15 minutes later, we were told they were running approximately 20 minutes behind. Not a huge deal, being Cheesecake Factory on a Saturday night. After 30 minutes, we asked again about being seated and were told that they were waiting for their large table to be vacated by a party who'd been there for 2 hours. Of course... who doesn't go to Cheesecake Factory for dinner at 4:00? Another twenty minutes goes by and again, we speak to the hostess station, who tells us the table just ordered dessert. At this point, it becomes pretty apparent we've been lied to. Finally after waiting for more than an hour and 15 minutes for a supposed reservation with two pregnant women, a diabetic and two antsy toddlers, we decided to leave.  I have no problem with Cheesecake Factory not taking reservations. I think it's ridiculous, but it's publicized, so we dealt with it the best way we could. Had the hostess we'd spoken to earlier in the day not said it wouldn't be a problem, we would have made other arrangements for dinner that night."
Nick S.,"Santa Barbara, CA",0,34,,4.0,3/2/2015,Great happy hour! Super busy and the service is mediocre.. Huuuuge menu.. I had the 5$ happy hour burger and it was good.
Heather R.,"Tempe, AZ",6,29,17,5.0,8/23/2014,Went for lunch with a medium size group. 6 people. Service was great. Waitress was very attentive and smiled. Food was really good. 3 of the group had never been before to Cheesecake Factory .We wil be back! Great stuff !
Asina G.,"Phoenix, AZ",294,258,46,3.0,7/22/2013,"It's a Cheesecake Factory, so you really can't ask for anything more.  I do like that they have entire ""skinny"" menu that offers healthier food and drink options."
Julie W.,"Portland, OR",269,182,50,1.0,9/3/2010,"Normally I would never pick to eat at the Cheesecake Factory, ever, but a co-worker picked it for a work function, so off we went.  There were about 10 of us in our group, and before we ordered we apologized to our waitress for needing separate checks. I think 7 checks in all. They seemed cool with it...at first.  I have to preface by saying, the worst service I've ever received has been at the Cheesecake Factory. Out of the four times I've been, every single time has been horrendous. The very first time I went (this was a different location)  one of my dining partners didn't get their meal for 20 minutes after ours. We were completely through with our meals but the server never offered to comp her meal. In fact, he was never seen after taking our order. We had to flag down a manager to take care of the issue.  The other few times I've had the slowest, rudest service of my life. This time was no different. The server acted thoroughly annoyed by our group, was short with us, refused to smile AT ALL, and generally was a complete wench. Splitting the tab was clearly WAY too much work for her, as it took 20 minutes for her to figure out who ordered what (even though we asked if it was ok to split tabs long before we ordered) but actually running the tabs? Wow, add on another 10 minutes! We apologized again for having to split tabs, hoping maybe that would make her less huffy, but she never acknowledged that we were trying to be nice, and instead just went around acting huffy and like we were thorns in her side.  Well, obviously she could be a total b*tch because gratuity was already included. 18% on the tab, which I understand with large groups. However, I felt she was acting as bitchy as she wanted to because in the end, she'd be getting a good tip regardless.  As for the food, it's a big whatever. Anything other than lunch is overpriced. In the end it's just overpriced ridiculously sized chain food . I don't understand why people love it so much. I hope for the rest of my life I never step foot in one again. I know I won't be missing much."
Valentino Z.,"Mesa, AZ",1,1,,5.0,12/5/2012,"We Only had 30 min and in that 30 min we had the most delicious appetizer, dinner and desert I've had in a long time. Will definite be visiting this place again! FYI: Try the avocado roll wrap thing a ma bobbers."
Evy G.,"Pasadena, CA",164,122,61,5.0,11/19/2010,"My best choice restaurant for dessert. I tried the famous Chris Outrageous Chocolate Cake and found my new favorite dessert! It's so delicate and at the same time the chocolate is not too overpowering the flavor of coconut mousse. The calamari is great, they cooked it just right. I'm highly satisfied with choosing this restaurant for dessert!"
Luna B.,"La Puente, CA",11,6,4,5.0,1/16/2015,First time eating dinner here and the shrimp and chicken gumbo was excellent.. The service was great and our server was polite and very attentive.. I would go back the menu had lost of endless choices to chose from.
Julia H.,"Phoenix, AZ",4,32,41,1.0,6/28/2010,"The last time will be the last time.  Yesterday at CF, waiter was passable. He did not offer to bring a glass with the beer, and did not do so until asked.  Food and drinks were good.  However, at end of meal a waitress from another table dropped/spilled a tray of drinks on the left side of my husband who is in a wheelchair with electric wheels. Husband's left side including wheels and batteries were drenched. Waitress did not initially apologize but stated, ""It's just a spill."" We asked several times for a wet cloth to wipe off sticky soda from husband, shirt, wheelchair and wheels. We moved to the next table to finish meal and to get out of the large puddle.  The manager came over after several minutes and offered to pay for dry cleaning; then the waitress said she was sorry. No comp, no apology until we cleaned up ourselves.  Even worse; two years ago a waiter dropped a tray of drinks on my son at the same place,and another customer who was sitting at a table next to us was also drenched.  This was weird deja vu.   Maybe CF has a policy that waitstaff have to carry as many drinks as possible, and they don't know their limit until they exceed it. Ha.  Overall, food was good and service was sub par. Attitude was LOUSY!  The customer who is paying about $25.00 per person ought to be treated as a guest and with courtesy.  Better luck when seated at the bar, on past visits. No spillage."
Christy G.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",13,41,5,3.0,1/3/2011,"So the first time I was considering going to this location, I was warned from my friends who work in the area that the last time they were there that they had to give some sort of warning due to a hepatitis a issue they were having... Anyhow, onto the actual review... the food overall has been mediocre at best.  Usually something's overcooked or bland.  The service each time has been relatively good.... and the personalities tend to surface.  The second to last time I went with a friend and we had dessert.  Ordered coffee with a shot of Baileys and had a slice of cheesecake each.  Our waitress was VERY enthusiastic about the cheesecake.  To the point of us being ever so slightly uncomfortable, but she did claim to have gained tons of weight at the start of her job due to having a slice every time she worked.  I suppose if you're surrounded by it, it could happen. Dinner wise, however, the portions are difficult to finish for the average appetite, but I tend to gravitate toward their small plates menu and order a couple of things off of that.  I also enjoy their Thai Chicken lettuce wraps.  It's a good place to go if you have a bunch of people who like a variety of things or just can't decide. This definitely is not my choice of places to go, but usually more like a... oh, we know it's open, it's not that far, and no one is in the mood for anything specific sort of place."
Faith A.,"Pasadena, CA",375,121,7,5.0,5/19/2010,"Big fancy chain restaurant? Big insane menu? Big servings? Small prices?  Dear Cheesecake Factory,  Say hello to your newest fan! I always imagined The Cheesecake Factory to be one of those places you go to for a boring corporate meeting or on a date with one of those cheesy guys who believes that this fancy Biltmore location will woo you off your feet (replacement for charm).  After trying this place out, I have completely changed my mind! The menu was extensive with an impressive variety of plates! I ordered these Vietnamese rice paper rolls that were just as delicious as the ones from the Vietnamese deli down the street. My friends ordered plates that were huge and mouth watering! To top it all off, the prices were extremely low and an exceptional value! I'll be stopping by whenever I'm in a mood to eat beyond my means :)  The staff was nice, nothing over the top, but with great locations and great values, the service is over shadowed by the food!"
Karen D.,"Phoenix, AZ",5,42,,4.0,10/16/2013,"Love the Cheesecake Factory, always have...every time I have dined there both the service and food were outstanding, and I can't remember ever ordering a dish that I ended up disliking.  I wish the cheesecake was just a little bit more reasonably priced, but that's about my only criticism."
