Paige E.,"Phoenix, AZ",78,42,,4.0,8/16/2013,"When I die, I hope it's because I was buried in a pile of the fried mac & cheese balls and I ate myself to death. No better way to go, imo. Also a fan of the Linda's Fudge Cake (I think that's what it's called?). Anyway, I don't know who Linda is but I hope she's living a great life."
Andi R.,"Los Angeles, CA",274,71,,1.0,3/24/2010,"Before I jump into this review, let me just preface it by saying that I'm really not a fan of chain restaurants (Chipotle, Jersey Mike's and Yogurtland excluded). And in my opinion, the Cheesecake Factory embodies everything I hate about chain restaurants.  Right off the bat, our server was rude and disinterested. And every time he visited the table next to us, he stood between their table and ours, with his behind right in our faces. He was incredibly slow in delivering drinks (we only ordered iced tea) and only came by to refill once.  I ordered the Evelyn's Favorite pasta which was surprisingly one of the few vegetarian items on the menu (aside from salads). My only request was to take off the Kalamata olives. Of course, when the food was delivered, it was chock-full of olives. So not only did the pasta lack flavor to start with, but the small amount of flavor that I was able to detect was ruined by the olives. I'm not a complainer, and I hate sending food back, so I picked as many out as I could, but it wasn't really worth salvaging. I mostly just pushed the pasta around my plate, took a few bites, and pushed it aside, which is disappointing since it's a $13 bowl of pasta.  When the bill finally arrived, it added up to just under $50 for two iced teas, one bowl of pasta and one cobb salad. I'm sorry, but that price is just absolutely exorbitant for the poor service and lack luster food. This visit was most definitely my last visit to the Cheesecake Factory. And if you happen to be looking for dinner at the Biltmore, I would suggest you stop ANYWHERE else."
Shanna K.,"Ypsilanti, MI",159,435,21,4.0,3/24/2010,"We're not big fans of chain restaurants, but the Cheesecake Factory is an exception.  You always know you're going to get tasty food, and a large serving (usually enough to share or take home half).  Plus, they've got a huge menu with a good number of veggie options (veggie burger, salads, pastas, sandwiches, etc). I love love love their avocado eggrolls.  So much deliciousness wrapped in wonton skins and then fried, with a yummy cilantro sauce. MMMM.  Their corn cakes are also good, but the sauces on them aren't veggie; just ask for salsa instead. I also love the brown bread they serve with all meals, even if you're just getting starters or cheesecake.  Speaking of which, they're actually pretty good, says my cheesecake snob partner (who is from NY), and big enough to share easily. I've actually been over-serviced at multiple cheesecake locations, which I guess is better than not getting enough.  On NYE, we went here for Cheesecake, drinks and the free champagne toast; we had two almost identical servers who clearly didn't communicate, and the two of us wound up with four classes of bubbly instead of two. I'm not gonna argue. They may have their off days for service, but their food is good, their menu long, and their servings big. It's hard to argue with that."
Giselle S.,"Santa Maria, CA",0,1,,5.0,11/5/2013,"The cheesecake Factory is a restaurant known for their variety of delicious cheesecake and their delightful meals. I have been to the cheesecake factory several times and in different states and cities and every time I have gone I have ordered something different. However, I have always been satisfied and delighted with my dinner. Nevertheless, to say that the servers are very gentile and attentive with their customers. The complimentary bread they serve is amazing I can literally say that I can stuff myself with bread and be a happy camper. I would totally make them a five star restaurant."
K Z.,"Seattle, WA",3,49,,4.0,7/5/2010,"Great food and an AWESOME Happy Hour!  While other restaurants have been cutting quality and quantity, this place isn't.  The food is delicious, and I'm amazed at how they do Mexican food dishes even better than a lot of the Mexican food restaurants around town.  The Happy Hour is soo good!  $5 giant sized appetizers are big enough for a meal and so delicious - especially the calamari, taquitos, and avocado rolls.  The drink specials are pretty great too - wine, beer, mojitos... you gotta love it!   The service has been good every time I've been there.  The wait staff are friendly, helpful and efficient. Cheesecake Factory is on the top of my list for places to go and my favorite Happy Hour haunt."
Tina B.,"Chandler, AZ",21,20,35,3.0,2/7/2013,I always have a pleasant experience when I go to Cheesecake Factory. The service is superb. Huge servings but the food is ridiculously overpriced. You're just paying for the ambiance. you can get better food elsewhere.
Pickles C.,"Phoenix, AZ",3,44,,2.0,8/1/2013,"I ordered a simple cheeseburger with bacon, tomato, lettuce, ketchup and mustard (sans the bun). I was brought a plate with a burger patty on it. Nothing else. I realize they have a menu larger than god's ego but if you can't do a simple burger right maybe you need to take out about 10 pages from your bulging at the seams menu and concentrate on a few specialties. They can't even get a burger right. Won't be going back. They should just stick to cheesecake, period."
Roma M.,"Richmond Hill, Canada",241,439,157,4.0,3/31/2010,"On my visit to CF, the service here stood out... Far beyond the food. In fact, I can't even remember what I ate. The waiter here was originally from Chicago and spoke about saving up to go back. He was incredibly warm and took care of a large order of 8 people with ease. He also kept bringing back their sexy bread, which I so love.  There are a few CF's in Scottsdale, but I'm sure this is the best one."
Joe X.,"Phoenix, AZ",2,219,4,2.0,4/8/2012,Food is average at best.  But last two times the service was terrible.  They need to retrain their servers in customer service.  The only reason for the 2 stars is that there is no denying that their cheesecake is excellent.
Deb N.,"Palo Alto, CA",285,1495,5443,3.0,7/18/2007,"I have a love/hate relationship with the Cheesecake Factory and I have been to a few, Palo Alto and SJ, CA, Seattle, WA and now Phoenix, AZ.  Love the food, the portions, vast selections of appys', entrees and desserts. Hate the wait and lack of reservations.  The Biltmore Hotel called in a reservation for us for a table of 8 for 6:30pm on Sunday.  It wasn't a reservation, nor a pseudo reservation, we ended up being seated at 6:50 pm.  If you don't get there (any of the restaurants early, before 5pm, expect a wait.) I ordered the Thai lettuce wraps, $15, extremely yummy and enough to share with 5 others and chicken and biscuits, $21, enough for 3 meals.  The biscuits are airy like Marie Callenders corn bread, I got 3 chicken breasts and plenty of gravy.  Friends ordered the Steak Diane, excellent mushrooms, miso salmon, shepards pie, just to name a few.  Everything was so good. The downside of our experience at this restaurant was the ordeal of no reservation and our waiter was inattentive, we had to ask for our drinks and appy's.  Had to ask the manager to find out what was going on with our waitstaff and order.  Hopefully, this was not the norm at this location."
Brittany D.,"Phoenix, AZ",25,25,11,1.0,8/2/2014,"Tonight my fiancé and I took my parents to Cheesecake Factory to catch up over a slice of cheesecake and a cup of coffee (it was 5:30PM) We got our coffees right away, but had to ask for water twice. After about 30 minutes we had asked for our check and a box from our waitress. 20-25 minutes went by and we asked again, she said ""I'll be right back."" Another 20 minutes goes by and we tracked down the manager. He apologized and said he would have the check right out to us. At 7:30, an hour and a half AFTER we asked for our check the first time, we had to walk up to the front, wait in line, and ask the manager AGAIN for our check. He apologized and brought it right out. Instead of offering to comp the meal, or ANYTHING, he took the coffee off. Really? Oh thank you for saving me $2.95. I waited an hour and a half to pay you guys. Needless to say, we left a $0 tip. Never going back to this Cheesecake Factory again. Also, we never got our boxes for our leftover cheesecake."
Gina C.,"Phoenix, AZ",14,7,,4.0,9/23/2011,"This is an awesome restaurant for family get togethers and is a favorite of my Dad's side. Their portions are meant more for two or three people than just one, so if you're open to splitting, this is the place to go. Their salads are always fresh and tasty and their pasta dishes are amazing. Pretty much anything that you order here is great. My husband and I always leave with that warm, satisfied glow and feeling comfortably full. There's no greasy, yucky aftertaste like a lot of places. Our favorites include the crab puffs, the asian chicken salad, their burgers and their penne spaghetti. They have a meal for just about any taste or craving and have the most enticing deserts! We had a raspberry-white chocolate cheesecake that was absolutely to die for! They have awesome rye bread, which you get for free before your meal to nibble on. The service is usually pretty good and we never really have any complaints. The staff are always friendly and helpful and always have positive things to say about the food we're ordering. They'll even go so far as to inform us of tasty new menu choices. Trust me...eat a meal here and you won't regret it."
Zoe L.,"Phoenix, AZ",17,30,43,1.0,8/5/2012,This location is a hot mess.  I love the Cheese Cake Factory but this locaton is not up to the standards that I accustomed to from this company.  Choose another location The waitress smelled like a pack of cigarettes.  So standing over me taking my order made my stomach turn.  Then my rice was undercooked.  When I told them it was undercooked they wanted to question me and say are you sure.  Im Asian I eat rice almost everyday.  There were Nat's flying around the food.  I won't be back to this location.
Nevin W.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,13,,4.0,6/24/2013,Their Chinese Chicken Salad and Oreo Cheesecake are to die for!! I always get sat immediately and get really fast service at this location.
Craig H.,"Draper, UT",7,9,2,5.0,5/24/2013,"Just came into town, and had wonderful service by Vince.  The smaller portion menu is great as well.  It is nice to get great customer service it is a real treat when so many companies could care less about it.  Vince does and it showed."
KJ W.,"Tustin, CA",11,107,1,3.0,6/1/2012,It's ok. Desert is great. Italian pasta suck. Bread is good.
Emily H.,"Phoenix, AZ",18,31,32,3.0,5/18/2012,"There's a enormous selection of food to choose from- so not only cheescakes here.  I had dinner here, had the chipotle pasta, etc... There was a long wait for our food after we ordered- about 30 minutes... The food was good, everything was cooked okay, but was not a fan of the bread in the basket- the taste was bit off.  Our service was okay and the waiter checked on us throughout our meal.  I did try their cheesecake- nothing too different from any other one.  The only thing I could suggest to the restaurant is maybe increase the lighting just a bit more."
Brad S.,"Scottsdale, AZ",36,195,5,4.0,11/4/2012,Food is always great.  I love the meatloaf sandwich.  The service is really hit or miss.  Sometimes I have great servers who are passionate about their work.  Other times service is just ok.  The ground is always super slick and sticky and it really takes away from the nice decor.
Nikki F.,"Virginia Beach, VA",604,332,420,3.0,8/11/2009,"Minus the 20 page menu and bad reputation for being overpriced and not that good, I kinda like this place. So shoot me. I came to this location for a drink, so I can't say anything about their food, but Doug, the bartender, is awesome. I immediately asked him what the weirdest thing that has ever happened to him was, and he was more than willing to share his stories.. something about eggs, I don't really remember (blame it on his shot count, which was well over 5 seconds) from there he was chatty Cathy till the tab was dropped.  If and when I come back here, I will get my usual - Tex Mex eggrolls to start, followed by the Chicken Madeira, and the Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake to complete a totally unhealthy ungodly amount of above average food. Cheers Doug!"
Tyler D.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,47,12,4.0,1/2/2013,"Ordered burgers from there tonight just to get something different for a change, amazing meat cooked as per ordered,great service, I have to say they di burgers as good as anyone else if not better! Kobe and chop house!!"
