Scott B.,"Buckeye, AZ",64,95,322,5.0,1/27/2012,"took my wife there for a date night. it was great. great food, great service, prices a little high but it is completely worth it, plus we got to go downtown. food was amazing and the desert was the best i have ever had."
Erin S.,"Schaumburg, IL",0,13,3,3.0,7/28/2014,"Great food and dessert obviously, but our waitress was horrible! Way too chatty, leaned over my food and beverage to deliver our check to the table before dessert even arrived!!"
Cadence C.,"Phoenix, AZ",52,247,7,2.0,8/10/2010,"It was great the last few times...  till I found a dried piece of spinach stuck on my fork when I unwrapped the silverware, and dishes had crumbs encrusted on them."
Charlie D.,"Phoenix, AZ",24,15,1,5.0,10/15/2013,"The Chicken Madeira and Steak Dianne combo is terrific!! I always ask for extra sauce and they happily give it to me. Most days I go here the service is great. I think in all the times I come here, which is often, I have only had 1 bad server but I've never had bad food. The Texmex egg rolls are delicious and you can't go wrong with any of the cheese cakes."
Kerstin M.,"Austin, TX",205,275,11,2.0,7/5/2009,"The real cheesecake factory is in my kitchen, just so you know. We had to stifle a sneer when the waiter tried to push dessert on us. I have had their cheesecake before this, and it just isn't very good. We are also huge fans of The Big Bang Theory, and since Penny works there, and Sheldon will actually eat there, how bad could it be? Analysis: not *bad*, just decidedly mediocre. I had the fish and chips. The fish was bland and overcooked, and the fries were pretty terrible. The zucchini small plate/app we had was flavorful and the zucchini was not fried to mush. The ranch it came with had a nice garlic zing to it. Hubby had the veggie quesadilla (a breakfast item, technically) and described it as ""fine"" but otherwise unremarkable. Sorry, Penny. I hope your salary on the show increases due to the heavy product placement fees that CF must be paying, but we won't be back."
Nick M.,"Phoenix, AZ",14,30,3,4.0,7/4/2012,"I guess The Cheesecake Factory doesn't really require a review but here's my two cents. I was a bit irate when they axed my favorite dish, the crispy spicy beef. Fortunately it was quickly replaced by my new favorite, the gumbo. I'm not really sure how a kitchen can specialize in every cuisine known to man but they manage to pull it off somehow. If i have one complaint, it's the excessive use of butter, which I can taste on my lips after every bite of almost every item on the menu. Then again, butter makes it better right?"
Lee M.,"Tulsa, OK",1,18,1,4.0,5/19/2014,"Took the family here tonight and had a very good dinner. Hibachi steak was cooked to a perfect medium and wife's salad was good quality with fresh greens.  Nothing over the top but always a good, consistent experience at ckf."
Ron M.,"Burlington, VT",5,45,,4.0,5/11/2011,"It's a chain restaurant but EVERY ONE of these places has good food, great service and an extensive menu (good for big parties/bad for indecisive people). Their desserts are AMAZING and IF you can finish your meal, then go for their signature cakes. Simply amazing is the best way to describe their cheesecakes and other savory cakes. If I did have a complaint (besides the extensive menu which can be daunting to some) it would be that this place is usually a bit noisy, but it's also huge and often full of customers, both good signs. Try it for yourself, and then make your own decision. I've tried everything from (chicken) sliders, burgers, pasta, steak, grilled chicken and seafood."
Tina T.,"Philadelphia, PA",321,619,42,5.0,1/9/2011,"I'll admit, it has been many years since I have had an actual meal here. The only reason I come is for the to die for cheesecake. It used to be that I would typically get the Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Cheesecake, which by the way, is sinful. Well, I guess they all are. It has an Oreo crust, chocolate chips throughout and on the top, and a generous dollop of whipped cream on the side. Then they introduced the Red Velvet Cake Cheesecake and I'm like, seriously, Cheesecake Factory? It has a moist, red velvet cake surrounded by layers of cheesecake. It also has a cream cheese frosting with what tastes like white chocolate shavings in the frosting. I came here yesterday with the excuse of validating my parking token (as my husband puts it, yeah right!). I got the Cookie Dough slice and then I noticed the Red Velvet which I thought was just a limited time. So what was an indecisive girl to do but get both slices. $16 later (yikes!) but I am the happiest girl in the world."
Nova S.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,5,,4.0,4/9/2014,I prefer local eateries but I did enjoy my meal at the Cheesecake factory at Kierland commons. Our server Ashley is a sweetheart and great care of my dairy allergy. The steamed dumplings were delicious :)
Koli H.,"Phoenix, AZ",18,69,,2.0,3/31/2009,"I don't care for this place all that much. But my friends do, and I can see how uneducated normal folk get sucked into the ""Cheesecake Factory Vortex of Doom"". i came here for a get together with friends the other night. The menus are a bit much with all that advertisements in them. The menu is eclectic, but I definitely think the prices are borderline gouging.  The portions are big, that is correct. But, chicken is cheap, and a plate of it with mash and gravy for $16 is a bit much.  The cheesecakes are delicious, all though we were a bit bummed to find out that the cheesecake is not made in house. My friends first choice was said to be unavailable because it was frozen. That means the place is not a Cheesecake Factory, but merely a Cheesecake Depot, where the real factory trucks in the baked goodies.  I strongly feel this place is WAY overpriced for what it offered. It is a casual, family restaurant with upscale dining prices. If they had a better product, I could stand spending $60 for 2, but not when it's a sandwich and Chicken and Biscuits."
Kelly R.,"Phoenix, AZ",469,243,849,3.0,10/14/2011,"Great food, but this location is always busy so it's not a good place to go if you don't have a couple hours to eat your meal. If they are busy, it could be difficult if you need extra accomodations. Not that they aren't willing to help, just a lack of space."
Sonya D.,"San Diego, CA",1610,651,37,4.0,1/3/2011,"This place never fails my taste buds. There are so many delicious things to order off the pages and pages of menu. We started with the artichoke and it was scrumptious. Both of the dipping sauces were yummy and the artichoke was cooked perfectly. After we shared Evelyn's favorite pasta- it came with lots of veggies and good tasting sauce. We chose not to eat the cheesecake (this time), but it has always been amazing in the past. Our waiter was nice, but definitely a cheeseball. But hey, it provided a good laugh for us throughout dinner."
Allison B.,"Greeley, CO",47,86,17,4.0,9/23/2011,"This is the first time that I have gone to the Cheesecake Factory and I am a fan! We started with the spinach and artichoke dip and it was pretty good. The bread that they brought out was I think dipped in a whole vat of butter, the complementary bread they brought out was actually better with the dip. For the main dish i got the Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta and it was awesome. The flavor and the crispy topping brought everything together. The veggies and the chicken were plentiful and covered in the sauce. I brought it home because i couldn't finish it all and it was just as good reheated. The wait staff was very polite and knowledgeable."
Benjamin B.,"San Francisco, CA",25,163,,3.0,3/18/2011,"went for drinks and dessert with my best-friend, tangie, during my recent stint to the metropolitan area.  dropping in at the biltmore location, we both found parking right out front. undecided on my beverage, i decided to try something that caught my eye...a blueberry mojito. if I can say this without sounding girly - simply fabulous.  i can't find any other way of describing this drink.  yes, it is made for the guy that simply cannot handle a man's drink. unlike tangie's ""on the rocks"".  she had something that would grow hair on my smooth chest....  for dessert we entertained ourselves with a delicious strawberry shortcake. even though we shared, we were unable to finish this delight. first time i have been to a cheesecake factory and found immediate seating... granted, it was after 10pm. never had a bad meal or time at this chain. thanks, tangie - you made my night."
Mo B.,"Tempe, AZ",141,169,257,4.0,7/1/2013,"CF is one of these places that I have to make a pilgrimage to at least once a year.  I love my Boston CF better for some reason, maybe cause it's home.  Anyway, this past weekend, I took my hubby there to celebrate his bday and come to find out he has NEVER eaten at a CF anywhere.  I almost fell when he spat out those words.  ""It's a rite of passage,"" I find myself squealing out.  Well, he loved it even though he couldn't get over at how small the filet mignon looked on the plate.  However, it was my friend who ordered the Jamaican dish with shrimp that had the best meal at the table.  I had a bite from her plate and my taste buds went into a convulsion, it was stupendous.  I had the salmon special.  It was good but nondescript.  The Kentucky tea and the cherry cheesecake were real smooth and good for my taste palette.  You can't go wrong when you choose CF.  I'm so glad that hubby's eyes and taste buds have opened up to the CF way of eating."
Dallas G.,"Phoenix, AZ",672,170,11,5.0,5/12/2008,"Why does everyone hate chains? They are chains because their food is tasty and their menu works. I'm sorry if it's not owned by vagrant bohemians. I'm one of the masses! My friend, who shall remain nameless for obvious reasons, works here and she makes fun of me for wanting to eat there. She makes fun of me for thinking it tastes good.  Everything I've ever had there is very good. Avacodo eggrolls make me smile.  Hepatitis schmepitiis..."
Lacy S.,"Greenville, SC",3,6,,1.0,6/24/2010,"I know alot of people seem to like this place,but you wont see me going there again.We had some friends in from Boston,and they wanted to eat somewhere that wasnt very fancy,so we picked Cheesecake factory.You should know that our groupd consisted of our 2 friends,my husband,my 4 yr old son and my 2 yr old son,and myslef who was 9 months preggers at the time.                When we got there,it was extremely crowded,we gave them our name and they said 10 minutes tops.Well 40 minutes later we were finally seated.The waitress was nice but stuffed us in to a very small booth.She was slow bringing our drinks and our apps,and only refilled our drinks once.            All of this could have been forgiven if the food was good.My husband and friend Tim ordered the steak both medium rare,what they got was a piece of meat smaller than the palm of my hand fully cooked.I ordered the Philly Cheese sandwhich,it had no flavor and tasted like it just came out of the microwave.Ive bought better at Wal-Mart.I ordered two kids chicken finger dinners for my boys but they only brought out 1 and when I told the waitress,she insisted that I only said one and that maybe the boys should share because the kitchen was really busy.                     I will never go to this restaurant again,bad service,horrible food,and not a good value at all."
Aimee H.,"Phoenix, AZ",343,294,21,3.0,8/24/2010,"This review is going to sound a bit harsh.... but I'm sorry, for the prices they are charging, I expect a little more class.  Yes, the food was good, the waitress was nice and funny, but they both needed a bit of refining.  To start off with the first thing out of the waitress' mouth was ""I love your hair!"" Then continued on about hair for anorther minute and a half, ending with when hers is wet it's ""like almost touching my butt."" OKay! Over-share honey! I'm supposed to order food and a drink now that we have discussed your butt? Anyway, finally moving on I ordered a tea and my friend got a water. Her timing for check backs were great, but refilled my tea waaaaaay too much, I would take two sips and then there she was again refilling my glass (and filling the air with unnecessary commentary), not to mention when she refilled my glass she had to pick it up every time and twice she touched the times on my forks. I know it sounds weird, but really bothered me. Another one of my big pet peeves, if you are wanting to remove a plate from the table and I have a utensil still on it, ask me to grab it off or just bring me a new one. DO NOT remove it yourself and place on the table, ick! She also grabbed my butter wrapper off my plate touching my bread. Just leave me a lone lady, stop touching all my s***! I felt like she wanted to pop a squat with us and have girl talk. Back off.  The food came, it was alright. I started with a side salad and friend for fried artichoke hearts. My salad clearly had been pre made and sitting in a cooler for hours, as the lettuce was brown and over dressed. The artichokes were good and the dipping sauce it came with was yummy. Everything else that hit the table was great. PS: Vanilla bean cheese cake is awesome!  Over all we had a good time. But for my meal costing me $30 and I didn't even have a cocktail, home girl needs to learn some cooth and manners serving a table."
Kat L.,"Phoenix, AZ",110,125,3,5.0,2/26/2011,"Happy hour at Cheesecake is the best!  (So that is purely what my review is based on!)  Super friendly servers, great drinks and excellent food!  Compared to the normal prices (which are pricey) happy hour is a great time to come in and get all the best appetizers for excellent deals!  Go and enjoy!"
