Connor T.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,9,,2.0,1/24/2015,"The food is decent a little bit overpriced my real problem with this place is the service we experienced. We were sitting outside for about 20 minutes waiters kept going by we got up and we were ready to leave when a server approached us and asked if we had a server so we said no  and he went and found who our server was.  Elizabeth than came to our table and said I kept wondering why no server was  checking up on you guys  turns out I'm your server. She kept making excuse after excuse not once did she apologize. By the end of our dinner we were already so annoyed by her she tried to get us to have desert and kept  trying to force us to have desert and than made a stupid comment  ""are you guys gonna make me run around here like a chicken with their head cut off to get you guys to order desert"" which we still have yet to figure out what she meant  by it. The bill then came you would've thought that when two people are spending almost a hundred bucks for dinner and drinks it would've been nice to have something taken off the check. Nope you're wrong not with Elizabeth. Oh and once more she made an excuse for making us wait 20+ minutes when the restaurant wasn't even busy. This happened about 3 months ago and I'm still furious about leaving her a tip. We've been back since and always make sure we don't have Elizabeth."
Herb W.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,1,,1.0,12/5/2013,"I recently moved to Phoenix from Las Vegas. I live across from Cheesecake Factory on Camelback Rd. I was hungry one night and stopped in for a quick bite on December 4th. I've always enjoyed their pineapple Mojitos  and the menu variety . I sat at a small table in the bar area. It was literally 5 mins before I was even acknowledged (I timed it)! Then menus were haphazardly dropped on the table. I wasn't offered water and warm bread came out 5 mins later. Meanwhile, the servers were congregating, laughing and joking in the back station, which was clearly visible from my table. I finally ordered a chicken Marsala and that took another 20 mins (I also timed that), to which I jokingly replied to my server (a young, bald AfricanAmerican server with large diamond earrings) ""I thought that you forgot about me?"" His curt reply was ""It's gotta cook!""....I probably won't go back to Cheesecake Factory based on this last visit, even though it is across from where I live, even if I am craving a pineapple Mojito. I am discovering that there are many other options in close proximity to me.....You NEVER know who your customers are! I've been in the restaurant business for over 30 years in New York, Paris and Las Vegas and have moved to PHX, to live and open a restaurant here....Oh, yeah, and I happen to be one of the Top Chefs in America:-) Herb"
Cher T.,"Tempe, AZ",310,166,72,5.0,3/25/2008,"I've had one of my best dining experiences here!! I went with some friends one night and we had a grand old time! We laughed and had the cutest waiter EVER! The food was awesome! but the skinny minies I had with me couldn't finish their food! Ugh, nothing is more of a turn off than to see a girl who weighs 80 pounds soaking wet swearing she can't have another bite!  Anyway I digress! I went another night another friend of mine. Him and I had an awesome time! We arrived and a table opened up quickly. We sat and were served well. Our waiter was very attentative, my friend thinks he hit on him though... but we always fight about which server is hitting on who! lol!  I ordered a SMALL cesar salad because my friend ordered a small soup. And they brought out this HUGE platter of salad! and the cesar dressing was so strong I couldn't eat it! I tried!! Really I did! it was like... stinging me! ouch! :'(  But I did order the chinese beef dish and that was INCREDIBLE! He ordered... hmmmm... I don't rememeber... but it must have been good he didn't complain. lol. We laughed and joked and talked and ate. We had too much fun. By the end of our meal he orded an pineapple upside down cheesecake! oh it was DEVINE!!!! I have never, EVER had a more better cheesecake ever! I will absolutely come back!  Our experience was amazing. simply amazing."
Aeneas L.,"Virginia Beach, VA",38,36,2,2.0,5/8/2011,"I will say this may not be a fair review as a drink was spilled on me in the first 5 minutes of me arriving and it may have been 50% my kids fault. The other drink spilled on me from my other kid was 100% her fault so I may be jaded, but the waiter didn't seem kid savvy and placed the wrong order for my wife. The manager said we'd get a credit for that one so we'll see. I'd suggest not bringing kids unless they're restaurant trained."
Kevin U.,"Phoenix, AZ",524,165,59,4.0,5/28/2008,"I respect any waiter at the Cheesecake Factory for learning the menu.  if you visit their website you have to download a pdf. to see the enormous menu.  Service is normally on point and the menu items seem to be very satisfying.  The location is great for a good size group and ladies always seem to enjoy themselves in the relaxing atmosphere.   I can't give 5 stars to a location that outsources its cheesecake, its defiantly not produced in house."
Amy B.,"Phoenix, AZ",3,60,,3.0,7/23/2010,The food here is just ok. The menu is huge so it takes a while to choose what you want to eat. My mom wanted to go here for her birthday dinner and when we told them it was her birthday they offered her a free ice cream sundae. Umm...isn't this place called the CHEESECAKE Factory? I thought it was lame that they didn't offer her a free piece of cheesecake.
Jenn H.,"Los Angeles, CA",200,152,3,5.0,2/26/2008,"Cheesecake Factory I love you. I love you. I love you. I have tried every single thing on the menu. You heard me. EVERY. SINGLE. THING. (Okay, not including the new hibachi menu. That is a brand new page added recently) It was all good. Mostly great. But if about 90% of your 1,000,000,000 menu items are awesome - you deserve 5 stars from me. PS - Please clean your bathroom more frequently. This might knoock you down a star."
Kimberly V.,"Phoenix, AZ",680,681,888,4.0,9/18/2009,"Feeling kind of ill, one of my Scottsdale besties swings over to get me out of my funk for a what...a piece of sweet??? UMMM ... I dont do sweets...and I usually do no chains... but.. because my uppity bestie was in the ying for a slice of cheesecake in my neck of the woods.. we went for the factory of all things...cheesecake. Seriously, Ive been to a Cheesecake Factory for birthday parties... or in malls. But I had to rate this place, bc the waiter was off the charts one of the best I have ever, yep! ever had... I told him I didnt have much of an appetite, as I mulled the book of a menu over and over and kept sending him away and my 'wanting only dessert friend' now wanted some orange chicken too... and bread...and a side salad.. geesh.. how can a 90lb girl want so much food? ... I ended up with a chicken sandwiche and soup... none of which was earth shattering... but I loved the waiter... we had fun with the fact that the seemingly 'we never get out much' peeps next to us didnt know how to act in a restaurant...and he brought us a piece of decadent red velvet cheese cake and even wrote in cursive a cute little note for me and my friend.. and I will leave it at that:-) Score for the factory.. compliments of the waiter... Now if they can find a way to control the other diners and the out of control kids.. they may be on to something."
Stevey P.,"San Diego, CA",641,553,79,4.0,5/8/2007,"OK, I'm gonna take one for the team and admit it.  Is it bad that I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place?  No judging now.   I mean, I usually reject any restaurant remotely chain-like, but Cheesecake Factory, you are one of a handful of respectable chains that I like and frequent.    An easy solution when you don't know what you want to eat (you're sure to find something in the menu, yeah, it may take 40 minutes to decide, but whatever), or want to take Aunt Dorothy and Uncle Charlie from the Midwest somewhere fun, but not too edgy or Scottsdale-like. Funny thing is I've had their cheesecake maybe about two times, because with the ridiculously large portions would I really have any room?  And if you're looking to totally WRECK your diet, this is your place - there's hardly anything healthy on the menu (but they did just start a lite salad menu).  My favorite appetizers are the avocado egg rolls and the sliders.  Grilled shrimp club, BBQ chicken pizza, blackened chicken sandwich,  chicken chipotle pasta, chicken romano, and chicken madeira are all REALLY good.  I guess I like chicken, huh? FYI, they don't have a kids menu, which is really DUMB, because this place is such a family restaurant. For those who care, they have Valet.  I mean, come on, really?  There is a parking structure on the other side of Macy's.  Valet in Phoenix with easy parking situation = lame."
Sam G.,"Atlanta, GA",310,31,1,4.0,8/28/2010,Really can't go wrong at just about any Cheesecake Factory but this one is exceptionally reliable. We frequent this location once or twice a month and almost always have perfect service and great food.
Sean B.,"San Francisco, CA",2246,2841,1478,5.0,10/20/2007,"Just about the biggest menu with the most variety of anyplace I've gone. Nice ambiance, very consistent dishes, generally friendly waitstaff. Amazing deserts. I really wish that they'd take reservations though, they're always busy. Still bitter that they did away with the Shrimp Poor Boy sandwich, that was my regular dish, and they ditched it. It was cheap and delicious and huge."
Yesenia R.,"Phoenix, AZ",151,22,21,4.0,10/20/2010,"I think cheesecake should be at the top of the pyramid but only if the food pyramid was flipped over!!!! Went here for lunch with my Candy friend, yes that is her name and no she doesn't take her ropa off for a living. :) Anyways, I had the Thai Chicken Pasta, which I loved. She had the Pasta Da Vinci. We both enjoyed our pastas, but the main event of the lunch was our ""Dulce de Leche"" cheesecake. Ahhh....did I mention cheesecake should be at the top of the food pyramid, but only if the wide side is at the top? On a side note, I really like this place because I can connect with their history. Small beginnings and look where the business is when you have vision. Gotta love the Overtons for that!"
Paul G.,"Peoria, AZ",0,4,,5.0,7/7/2011,"If you are looking a flavor explosion in your mouth.  Open wide here comes Cheescake Factory. Everything I have tried here is really good.  The tiramisu cheesecake is the best I have ever had.  Even if you do not like cheesecake you will love the tiramisu. The standouts for the appetizers are the buffalo blasts.  They are like shredded chicken deep fried with cheese around it dipped in buffalo sauce. Oh it's so so good. I also like the factory burger for my main dish. It's a hamburger in sour dough bread with onions with fries. Trust me it's really good. My wife and I always go on eachothers birthdays so the workers can sing to us. Great food, service and setting.  I love this place."
Jil B.,"Minneapolis, MN",0,8,,1.0,4/11/2013,"Watch out for your credit card!  Server stole my credit card and used it fraudulently.  When I called the manager, I received a very snarky sarcastic response.  I have spent hours of my time dealing with this and did not even receive an apology!  Thank goodness I am from a different state where people actually care about others."
Sophie M.,"Phoenix, AZ",106,89,5,3.0,2/26/2008,"I wish I could say this place is a secret guilty pleasure. I don't know what it is that keeps bringing me back, perhaps it's the never-ending menu and the hope that maybe someday I will order something I like. However, that has yet to happen and more often than not I find myself disappointed.  Or maybe I am just not ordering the right dishes? I've tried the grilled cheese, Pasta Da Vinci, chicken Madeira, Caesar Salad, Cheese pizza, Roasted chicken.....all being mediocre. Sure, they load your plate with enough food to last you an extra three meals, but they're an extra three meals I'm just not really interested in.  The service is always great, though. Maybe they feel the need to make up for the ridiculously long waits this location often suffers.... I think I am done experimenting."
Donald S.,"Newport Beach, CA",590,448,25,3.0,3/20/2009,"I had a lunch meeting today and my lunch companions suggested ""the Cheese"". So, off I went. I've been to this location and to the Cheesecake Factory in NoSco a number of times over the years, but a fresh visit at lunch today gives me a reason to review Cheesecake Factory. We've all been there, right? The food is pretty good, they have a big, giant, varied and eclectic menu (thank you messieurs Roget). You get a metric ton of food for the price (I brought approx. 2/3 of my club sandwich home with me and my puppy couldn't be happier, plus, I couldn't begin to eat all the fries). No room for cheesecake on this visit or I would tossing and turning at my desk all afternoon. I don't think the food is really the point with Cheesecake Factory. The lunch was nice, the food tasted good, and the atmosphere was really very pleasant. The service was good, prompt, attentive and friendly. There just isn't anything that stands out about Cheesecake factory to make me want to give them more than an average rating. They do lots of things pretty well, but if I wanted great fried chicken, I'd go to Lolo's...if I wanted a great steak, I'd run up to the Fairmont...you get the idea. So, pretty good, esp. for a chain, with good service and good price points and more food than you haul in wheelbarrow!"
Purpleherbalwear N.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,8,,3.0,9/21/2012,"ok the stars are for the cheese cake, it is really good i believe it was called upside down cheesecake..? yummy!.. cheese cake the only thing u need to go here for. Unless you starving, they give huge portions of dinner food, so be wary of what u get. I can say I would go back for a peach bellini! yummy!      what brought me to right this review is the Bad food service, the waitresses and waiters were to busy, i'd say flirting, with each other. luckily we had a older respectable waitress. the food, how to put this.. the veggies looked great but tasted like charcoal! upon further inspection of "" where is that burnt smell coming from"" ""is it your food"" (snif snif) nope... bam it was the veggies that are served in a lil black tray. they were hard and so black on the bottom and gooey, some sort of morphing thing happening, a unbearable smell came out after moving the veggies around! its all we could smell. haven't been back since. so just smell your food upon arrival."
Anna L.,"NY, NY",21,449,17,3.0,12/18/2009,"You really can't ever go wrong with Cheesecake Factory  no matter what city you're in.  (Though I've found the one in Northern NJ and in Phoenix is better than Baltimore) Big menu, decent eats, and affordable."
Jlyn R.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,3,,4.0,5/12/2009,"Of course once I began to read the novel the call the menu I found myself in that glutonous disposition where I wanted one thing from each page. I actually skipped on the appetizer (a first) in hopes of forking some food off of everyone elses plate, after I was done with my Bang Bang Chicken. YUM. Seriously chicken curry at the cheesecake factory? Yup. you name it and they've probably got it. Just avoid the Chicken Curry Cheesecake (kidding). Bring your reading glasses and decide the base food you want: steak, chicken, pasta. Trust me it will save you an hour."
Justsun B.,"Carlsbad, CA",138,136,194,4.0,3/4/2009,Safe quality service and I'm sorry Arizona but I can't find another restaurant that can compete... So sad to say...
