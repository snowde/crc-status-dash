Cristina N.,"Portland, OR",2,8,,1.0,3/11/2010,"I hate this place, if I could give half a star, I would. I'm weary of chain places and this restaurant reminds me why - the service is often atrocious (or maybe we just got the worst waitress on the planet that night) and having to leaf through the extensive menu for 15 minutes only prolongs the wait for what will be a mediocre meal. That, and it's full of people who make me embarrassed of Americans... obese folk with annoying kids and striped shirts. Won't go back."
Mario B.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,10,,3.0,8/20/2009,Service was good but  the food I thought could of been better but the Adam's cheese cake is the way to go.....I don't even like cheescake but it's a very rich and Big piece....it was around $7 for a slice but you can split it with someone. Nice place for dessert!
Joe A.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,34,,1.0,8/8/2011,"The dish I had, the wasabi crusted ahi tuna was awful and it was served twice, both times unacceptably.  The ""crust"" is really bread stuffing on the outside and the miso glaze was a miso cream sauce, huh?  How can you call a rich, greasy sauce served on the plate a glaze.  Very confusing, unappetizing and this dish should be chopped.  Not a good experience."
Rebecca S.,"Phoenix, AZ",84,222,15,3.0,12/15/2009,"i had the herb crusted salmon. it was really, really good. they served it on broccoli instead of mashed potatoes because i asked. the group ordered the h u g e sampler platter, which gave 7 people each an adequate serving - it would provide more than enough for a party of 4. the food was good and i liked the variety. i am, of course, annoyed by the excessively long menu, complete with advertisements, but whatever, the salmon was surprisingly good. and yeah, they do make awesome cheesecake, including the low carb one. for me, the cheesecake factory is is a-ok."
Victor H.,"Alhambra, CA",62,118,47,5.0,3/8/2008,"I have not had every single thing on the menu, but I have had plenty of exposure to their 'Modus Operendi' ....and let me tell you, it is a FULL FIVE STARS for service, quality of food fare, location, environment (inside and out!), atmosphere (design), and the attention to detail with regards to our needs as customers.  The later being the most noticeable and appreciated. The waiter's timing and concern for our needs was uncanny, from the moment my friend and me sat down to the moment we were ready to lean foreword and depart to other realms! The decor is well balanced and not suffocating.  I felt a sense of privacy, yet not forgotten in the crowd...I would Highly recommend this location for any form of date or professional get-together.  rest assured that you will not have to think about arrangements for you and say up to four people...More than that, and you might want to call ahead and see that they can accommodate to your liking. Otherwise---""Bone-That's-Petite!"""
Matt S.,"Phoenix, AZ",8,115,,4.0,3/11/2008,"When Cheesecake introduced their monstrosity to the Biltmore years ago, I was turned off by breathless staff pushing drinks and skimpy desserts, and by longer waits than a GP's office in flu season. But I have to say that, over time, I've warmed to this conglomerate - even as I subsequentyly learned that eating here regularly might kill me.     The staff has settled in and mostly toned it down, and now our entire family revolves through CF's front door with confidence, and suspiciously early for dinner, to avoid waiting room rigor mortis.  Overall food preparation is at least one notch below Houston's across the street and one notch above adjacent CPK, which is more impressive than it sounds considering the legendary breadth of Cheesecake's menu.    It's all respectably prepared, if fattening, and often quite good.  I like the fish tacos (standard fish but massive fixins) and the portabella and asparagus omelette. Mom gravitates towards sublime corn tamale cakes, and Chris is seduced by a salad presented in two huge conical mounds he likes to call ""Dolly Parton"".   There's an item or two on this menu to pique anyone's interest, and while the Factory probably wont serve up your best meal ever (unless you dont get out much), a truly disappointing meal here is rarer than Steak tartare. Portions are large and we almost always pass on dessert.  Not the kind of restaurant to whip out an engagement ring in (this is a Factory, after all), but a safe choice for the family, stargazing (Suns opponents staying at the Ritz eat here all the time), or a pre-movie dinner date. Well, safe until you die."
Nick S.,"Scottsdale, AZ",18,33,,3.0,5/15/2008,"To be honest with everyone here,  The Cheesecake Factory Sucks. I don't mind eating there but where is the personal style, the flair.  i remember how everyone always loves to go to the Cheesecake Factory for a romantic dinner.  COME ON....  the only romantic things about this is helping your mate eat the Snickers Cheesecake after you take it home.    Overall I would only really go to Cheesecake factory to pick up a dessert. HENCE THE NAME"
Jack C.,"Scottsdale, AZ",1,7,,5.0,12/11/2010,I love love love the chicken Cesar salads here and of course the Cheesecake. Service is always really fast and I am never disappointed.
Jennifer M.,"Phoenix, AZ",276,126,1,3.0,4/12/2009,"Went for my sister's birthday dinner last night. I like the atmosphere there and the service was pretty good. But I always think to myself that they are just a bit overpriced and the food just misses the mark of being great (I got the Navajo sandwhich, it just kind of fell apart and was stuffed with really thick slices of underipe tomato that was white in the middle. Fries were cold). We ordered the kids' pasta for my son and it was just that- a bowl of WAY too hot pasta (I just don't know why restaurants serve kids' meals at 1000 degrees). But that was it, just pasta, no veggies or sides. It is a family place no matter what they try to be, it is a big loud place that people bring their kids to, is it too much to ask for a nice, healthy meal for my kid? But I digress. Again, loved the service but the food was underwhelming. Luckily I really enjoyed spending time with my family and that made it fun :)"
Jake C.,"San Francisco, CA",62,288,7,4.0,2/8/2007,"If you can navigate your way through the thirty page menu, you'll find that they actually have some great offerings at the Cheesecake Factory. Portions are huge, usually amounting to atleast two or three meals for yours truly, so taking that into consideration the prices aren't bad.  Appetizers are all tasty, and their versatility on the rest of menu is really quite impressive. My favorite two things on the menu are the fish tacos and the orange chicken. They have completely different flavors and creative takes on traditional dishes.  It's very corporate, and the rumor on the grapevine is that although it's pretty good money, working there is no fun."
Kelly P.,"Phoenix, AZ",8,29,,4.0,8/30/2008,I dig Cheesecake Factory. I've been here a bunch of times and never had a bad meal there. My last visit was for lunch with my friend and her 3 year old daughter. As soon as we were seated our server brought us bread and fruit for the kiddo. Portions are ginormous -- we had the Asian Chicken Salad and the fish tacos and went home with a full bellies and doggie bags.  The cheesecake rocks - I recommend the chocolate chip cookie dough. Yum!
Thomas S.,"Minneapolis, MN",2534,538,56,3.0,7/16/2007,"Loved it years ago in LA....feel as though with any enormous chain restaurant, quality is suffering. Do I love that the menu is longer than the Bible? Or does it actually just drive me mad causing me to drive my salad fork into my forehead while perusing the ad-riddled pages? I'm always here for the comfort food. And I don't order those ridiculous salads, large enough to fill the salad bar at Soup Or Salad! Frankly I simply cannot digest all the raw roughage in one sitting. Cauliflower is no longer my friend. Yesterday I ordered the Hungarian Beef Ghoulash. Meet was very tender, gravy was too salty and the egg noodles that came with were a bit bland. I guess you need to ask for a gravy or sauce for them, cuz they was jest naked. Rickie's meatloaf, tasted just like my entree...I swear...I tasted no difference in the sauce. The Buffalo Chicken triangle thingy appetizer was different and tasty. Crispy, spicy triangles of lightly battered something or other filled with chicken. With so many newer places opening up all over town done in minimal/urban decor, The Cheesecake Factory really sticks out like a loud relative at a dinner party. Hmmm...will I go back? Probably...too convienent after movies at the Esplanade. And if I try everything on the menu eventually, I know I'll be navigating my walker with the yellow tennis balls attached, but I'm bound to find the fresh, consistent and comforting dish I so want."
