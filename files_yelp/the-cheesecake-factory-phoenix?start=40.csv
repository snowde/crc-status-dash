Beverly T.,"Phoenix, AZ",7,6,,3.0,1/19/2017,Our party of 10 had dinner last night and for the most part it was very enjoyable.  The service was slow and some of the food when it came out was cold.  Since my husband and I were picking up the  tab come to find out from our guests only when outside and saying our goodbyes that it was mentioned by several people. My dish of Skinny Chicken Pasta was cold and I had to look for my chicken but decided not to say anything.  Our bill was $360.00 and not objecting  to that but the kicker was that my husband was celebrating his Birthday and his cheesecake was supposed to be complimentary. It came with good wishes on it and some of the staff sang as well. After reviewing the bill this morning they had charged us for the Cheesecake .  Kind of puts us off for doing our next celebration  at the Cheesecake Factory.
Tiffany M.,"Tempe, AZ",11,6,,3.0,9/3/2017,"Went to Cheesecake Factory today and got the bacon bacon cheeseburger which was good but the bread they give out which is normally soft and delicious but today is was hard and burnt. I told the waitress and she said "" okay I will go get you fresh bread"" which rubbed me the wrong way since I'm not understanding how we didn't get fresh bread to begin with. The bread was clearly burnt on the bottom."
Nathan R.,"Gilbert, AZ",1,46,3,3.0,3/2/2017,The food is fairly good but for the price I think it leaves some to be wanted. Our server was pretty good but we had one of those awkward moments where everyone's food was brought out except one person. So everyone politely didn't eat until the other food arrived (only 3-4 minutes later) and we enjoyed some awkward silence. I think ideally they should have just waited to bring everyone their food.
Diana S.,"Laveen, AZ",8,44,74,4.0,4/20/2017,"Easy place to eat. Large menu. Got the avocado egg rolls, and the bistro shrimp pasta. Both are good except they should have put more sauce on the pasta. Serving size is HUGE, shared my plate with my mum and we were both stuffed. Service is a little slow... Didn't refill bread and water took a while to refill. The servers were very polite though."
Joe D.,"Scottsdale, AZ",112,2,,5.0,8/23/2017,"I always enjoy this place.   Whatever you're in the mood for... well it's probably on their menu.  Plus,  the portions after always ample.  I had the Cuban today and was very satisfied."
Christi D.,"Escondido, CA",0,9,13,5.0,5/17/2017,"Amazing low carb cheesecake clean, great service and great seldction per usual! Glad to have gone out on a whim and ordered the chicken teriyaki - high quality white meat!"
Alex B.,"London, United Kingdom",3,38,,2.0,5/14/2017,"My first time in a cheesecake factory in 10 years and the quality has gone down tremendously. Service was fine if a bit pushy (really wanted to turn tables) but the food was just horrid. Sure, you are getting big portions but the quality was so low. It was just a hair above canteen slop. I guess the good thing was that it didn't cost much."
Terrance H.,"Chandler, AZ",272,134,68,5.0,1/30/2017,My family and I (party of 6) dinned in on a Sunday afternoon and had a great experience.   The service was outstanding. Our server was Marisa and we couldn't have asked for a more patient and kind person to help deliver our overall experience.  I have an uncle who at time can be a handful with his request and can be extremely talkative. She handled him in the best way possible which relieved some of my anxieties.  The only room for improvement was the hostess. She didn't deliver the service standards that Cheesecake factory is known for.   The food was solid across the board and everyone was satisfied with their meals. Thank you Marisa for the great service and for ensuring my family had another memorable experience at the Cheesecake Factory.
Pratishruti M.,"Scottsdale, AZ",273,200,1263,4.0,11/24/2015,"Save some room in your stomach for those guilty pleasures, this is The Cheesecake Factory after all.They have an insane variety of cheesecakes.The Red velvet, Fresh strawberry and the original are my favorites. However, if you are not into Cheesecakes they also have some mean ice cream sundaes and   cakes.The Black out cake is so Gooey(must have if your a chocoholic). I generally end up eating just appetizers and desserts because the dessert portions are really huge and can be shared by two (or Not). They have a pretty extensive menu with a good variety of cocktails,Beer,Wine,Milkshakes etc. I tried the Peach Bellini which is a blend of Champagne,peaches and peach Liqueur.It was quite refreshing and tasted more like a peach smoothie nothing too strong.We also had some stuffed Mushrooms and Crispy fried Cheese. The booths are cozy with dim lights,service was fast and friendly.This Location definitely scores higher than the others. Cheers!"
Rachel B.,"Phoenix, AZ",70,11,9,1.0,9/2/2017,"I've had a few bad experiences here, but this was the worst. I was given a time of 15-20 minutes to pick up my food, and I showed up in 18 minutes. I called curbside and notified them I was there. Fast forward over 45 minutes and 3 curbside phone calls later, I cancelled my order. The lady on the phone was rude and ended with a ""whatever."" Each time I called, they said they were heading out the door, but they weren't and the last time I asked for an actual estimate, but she couldn't give me that."
Mari G.,"Phoenix, AZ",36,41,19,1.0,7/16/2017,"Decided to give Cheesecake Factory another try and was once again very disappointed. This restaurant nickel and dimes you to death. When you order their dishes they come out with very little sauce, when you ask for more they charge you $2 - $3 dollars extra. This is petty and unacceptable. With the hundreds of fabulous restaurants in town to choose from I don't know why anyone would choose this tired chain option. The pride they once put into the preparation of their menu is gone avoid this place and go to an establishment that values their customers."
Mark C.,"Yucaipa, CA",0,39,,2.0,12/8/2016,Went with friends on visit to Phoenix Camelback location Food was marginal Salad dressing was off maybe over cooked Eggplant was but little taste Salmon was overlooked  Too expensive a meal to not have the taste right Service was very slow
Scott S.,"Chandler, AZ",24,3,1,5.0,8/12/2017,"We came here on a whim and holy moly were we pleasantly surprised. I had the pasta napoletano and I absolutely destroyed it. Creamy, buttery and full of flavor; I will absolutely have this again. Of course you can't leave without a slice of their heavenly cheesecake. I chose the dulce de leche. No regrets. Reasonable price. Everyone should eat here."
Zack B.,"Phoenix, AZ",75,6,4,1.0,7/25/2017,"I order the chicken fettuccine Alfredo pasta for take out and it was disgusting. The sauce was really grainy and the chicken wasn't even cook completely, the pasta was the same way not cooked completely and stuck together. Bad experience over all."
Harry K.,"Scottsdale, AZ",419,146,56,4.0,6/30/2017,"Came here on a date with the wife the other day. It's impossible to not find something I will like at the Cheesecake Factory. The skinny menu is great when I'm dieting, and the low carb cheesecake was a great cheat - I am a big fan of the burgers for when I inevitably fail on my diet. The highlight of the most recent meal was our server Joe C, he was hilarious and offered great service - if you read any of my restaurant reviews, I pretty much judge a restaurants service based on whether I see the bottom of my soda glass, and joe kept me very hydrated"
Stephanie B.,"Ventura, CA",29,60,2,2.0,10/5/2016,"I'm not sure what's going on or if this place has a new cook, but I ordered the salmon tonight and the whole filet was undercooked.  I ordered it to go so I had to finish cooking it myself.  I ordered food a few weeks ago and I probably had 2 small pieces of chicken in my tomato basil pasta.  For the amount of money these dishes cost, I would expect to have cooked food and larger portions.  I'm going to take a break from this place for a while until they get it together!"
Christina L.,"San Francisco, CA",372,661,1935,4.0,9/12/2017,"i havent been to a cheesecake factory for a little over 7 years. it was a college staple for friends' birthdays, and i tried the sf location when i first moved to the city in 2010, and that was it. cut off. until i arrived in phoenix on sunday and thought this would be a fun option in the camelback area. walked in and sat at the bar, and the place didnt have a line out the door (UNUSUAL).  the bar area was pretty popular though, since there was sunday football and a few high tops were taken. i perused the drinks menu (never ordered those before at cheesecake!) and settled on an espresso martini - came out relatively quickly, and it was delicious! i would have one more before leaving... my go-to at cheesecake is the bang bang chicken and shrimp dish served with rice and with toasted coconut on top. so naturally i ordered that and a side of roasted brocoli (which tasted really healthy and i was grateful for that!) the dish was certainly a lot better in college, but it brought me back! the coconut curry is still pretty delicious, and i still wish that they gave you more sauce for the amount of rice. but other than that, i cant complain. had leftovers for lunch the following day :) service was nice and quick. i would come back i think if i were on the road again!"
Amanda M.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,27,21,5.0,7/21/2017,The servers are always attentive when we eat dinner here. The food is not and delicious. The longest we have had to wait for seating has never been longer than 10 minutes.  This place is mid range price with high quality food and staff. Highly recommended
Kacee F.,"Rio Verde, AZ",8,202,2,2.0,6/12/2017,"First time visiting this CCF.  Very noisy and not enough light to see the menu, had to use flashlight on phone to read the menu.  I was surprise they did not have many vegetarian items... Had the super anti-oxidant salad which was very small  less than half the size of the salads I used to get last time I visited.  I wish there were more of the fruits  as the menu stated but mostly just greens and not very filling.... As for the cheesecake I received the littlest piece of cheesecake ever less than one inch thick and it was on the sour side.....They were out of my favorite Key Lime....They said they would send me a gift card for a free slice, paying $8 for a sour slice of cheese cake not good.....I was not impressed, the waitress was great but the food did not wow my taste buds, everything was just boring."
Gabriel G.,"Paradise Valley Village, Phoenix, AZ",0,15,11,5.0,1/22/2017,Went out with my entire family and it was just perfect. The mac n cheese burger is scrumptious. Everyone loved their food and the setting was great. There was a little wait but it was well worth the great food. Our server was very nice. We all left happy and will definitely come back.
