Sandy O.,"Phoenix, AZ",6,12,,1.0,7/15/2017,"So I ordered take out.  Teriyaki chicken plate  $16.99 . I must say that No forks or napkins , No complementary bread and the quality and the portion was very poor. I dont get it . I have ordered this many times before and it has been really good but this time I dont know what happened but my first words when i saw the plate were ""gross "" . Next time  (wont be) I will have to go back and have the cook or ""chef"" eat it ."
Kenya W.,"Phoenix, AZ",46,68,85,4.0,4/23/2016,"Had the Samoas and the dulce cheesecake and I would say it was spectacular, the beef in the Samoas was well seasons and has a crisp bite that melted into your mouth. The beverage the strawberry creamsickle was not the greatest, over powered with alcohol. The sangria was watered down with ice! But overall a great place for a first date"
Cory L.,"Aiea, HI",13,109,317,4.0,5/12/2017,"Food was great, nothing spectacular. We had lunch for a party of 15 following ASU Graduation. Service was on par no complaints. They do take reservations which was awesome."
Pamela R.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,4,,1.0,10/2/2017,Food is awful. Taste like commissary prepared. Pass this place up.
Eric B.,"Chandler, AZ",793,489,913,4.0,7/18/2016,"I've visited this location for lunch a few times with work associates and every time the food and service has been great. I love the strawberry lemonade they serve -- perfect balance of sweet and sour. Their beef dip sandwich, fish & chips, and Cuban sandwich I all highly recommend. And of course you can't go wrong with any of their delicious cheesecakes! I didn't get a chance to try it on account of being too full on my last visit, but what looks suuuuper appetizing is the Oreo cheesecake with whole Oreos actually inside the cheesecake! I will definitely be back for a slice of that. :D"
Reece M.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,3,,4.0,10/7/2017,Great food. Quick and friendly service. I usually get take out and it's always ready when they say it will be.
CheRich R.,"Peoria, AZ",34,76,118,4.0,3/27/2016,Fresh yummy brunch with a nice atmosphere the waiter was timely and the restaurant was clean
Yadhira C.,"Phoenix, AZ",29,37,36,1.0,4/12/2017,We had dinner at this restaurant last night and I was so disappointed. The server was great and the restaurant Itself looks lovely but what good is that if the food is going to be horrible! No one liked what they ordered the only thing I enjoyed was the appetizer and my glass of wine. We had to return a couple pasta plates because they were so salty I mean really salty unable to consume. May I add these plates are around 20 bucks each. You can find way better restaurants for the same price range even cheaper. We should've gone to the vig like we initially planned but we wanted to try something new. Oh well now we know we for sure won't be returning. Lots of better food options out there!
Andrew K.,"Phoenix, AZ",316,210,310,5.0,2/18/2015,"I know it's a chain, and it's not ""cool"" to review chains, but whatever, we had a good experience, so I'm going to let people thinking about eating there know... :P  We experienced the Cheesecake Factory's Happy Hour, and ooooh what a happy hour it is. Probably the best happy hour I've encountered in a very long while. Everything that's normally well over $12 is $5, so we went crazy and ordered a plethora of things, and they were all good. Plus, with the look of the place, you really feel like you're doing some fine dining. Oh, and our server took good care of us. We'll return."
Ziad S.,"Phoenix, AZ",12,35,120,4.0,9/26/2016,"Love this place. The salmon is excellent, the herb crusted salmon with mashed potato and asparagus is my personal favorite! Wide variety to choose from."
Marc D.,"Phoenix, AZ",7,4,3,1.0,2/25/2017,"This was probably the second worst service I've ever receive at a restaurant, you know when you get bad service when the moment you seat down and when you get your drinks. Took total 10 mins to get our water and then from that moment on just the guy kept forgetting about us. Other ppl had to serve us. I lost my appetite when I got my food when I had to wait for it when my other 2 guest got theirs."
Mia N.,"Phoenix, AZ",259,552,346,3.0,12/18/2015,"I ordered off the ""Skinnylicious"" menu.  Not really because I'm trying to watch my weight, but because I can't eat cheese and one of the only pastas without cheese was on that menu.  I also ordered the side house salad, which was decent, but drenched with too much salad dressing and the tomatoes was not a ""good"" ripe tomato.  I also ordered the chicken rigatoni pasta in red sauce with basil.  Nothing too amazing, I could definitely cook something just as delicious at home.  So I enjoyed the food overall, but found it all a bit overpriced. The nice thing is that even on a Friday night they will take reservations for large groups."
Shaun S.,"Mesa, AZ",0,7,,3.0,9/16/2017,What is so damn hard about adding butter to the bread for take out. You spend 100 bucks on a meal and can't get freaking butter for the bread. Every single damn time!
Rachel K.,"Phoenix, AZ",2,16,,5.0,5/4/2017,"Best G'Dang bartender in Phoenix! Attentive, talented, and kind, you are sure to have a great night with John Nagy behind the bar. Remember, tip em well, and they'll surely be good to you! Respect!--Enjoy!"
Lucy S.,"Chandler, AZ",1,1,,2.0,2/10/2017,"My shrimp scampi with pasta was super salty.  I always order the same thing, and it's way too hit and miss."
Jonathan G.,"Las Vegas, NV",66,4,,4.0,5/15/2017,I went to have brunch here for Mother's Day. Party of 12. The wait was only about 20 minutes and the staff was friendly. They took my stroller and stored in for me while we ate since the space was a little tight which was nice of them. I ordered the chicken piccata and it was excellent. my wife got the chicken mushroom soup which she loved. they validated my parking. Overall I enjoyed my time here.
Karen C.,"Phoenix, AZ",159,96,1116,5.0,3/9/2017,"I have eaten @ this front location of Biltmore Fashion Park and each time it has been a positive experience.  This type of restaurant not only serves their signature cheesecakes with various flavors and toppings, it also serves typical lunch food (BLT sandwich w/ fries, appetizers) and Happy Hour.  It's more of a grown-up family and friends type of place moreso than families with kids.  There is also a patio to sit out and enjoy (loud) company and tolerant weather ;)  The servers are professional and happy to take your cameras/phones to snap pictures as per your request (so that the restaurant backdrop can show ;) ).  The atmospheric lights are dim with the restrooms even more dim.  The ambiance and room temperature are at a comfortable level and while it's casual dining, it's better to put on something nice being this is Biltmore and the restaurant chain started out in Beverly Hills, California.  That is only if you want to fit in.  I usually come here to enjoy original-flavored scrumptious cheesecake.  Have tea with it-  it's a plus for your palette ;)  Even the plain cheesecake is that filling so eating a lunch with it could cause my stomach to explode ;)  There is a bakery in front if you'd like to purchase their cheesecakes.  Thanks!  BTW, I love the revolving entry door :)"
Carolyn L.,"Surprise, AZ",110,46,29,4.0,9/22/2016,"This is some of the best Orange Chicken I've had. Delicious. The flavor is just right, not over powering with ginger or spice. The brown rice is so good. You get a huge scoop of it and I never finish it anytime I go. The bread and butter, yum!  I really don't think you can get a bad thing on the menu. One thing I found interesting is the Arnold Palmers are made with Pink Lemonade. Isn't it supposed to be yellow lemonade you use??  I don't know, thought that was weird. I never have room for the cheesecake thou! Always leave stuffed!  Thanks Cheesecake Factory! One reason I left four stars rather than give this time was because my entree was not delivered with the rest of my parties entrees. So they all started eating before I received my food."
Jessie A.,"Flagstaff, AZ",24,50,90,1.0,2/26/2017,"Worst management at a Cheesecake Factory I've ever been to. Always running out of menu items, service is bad, restrooms are filthy... it's a shame considering it's location. Made the mistake of coming back a few times, won't happen again."
Cassidy C.,"San Diego, CA",341,36,8,2.0,12/21/2016,"WOW I called today on Dec 21st at to ask the hostess if this was the Scottsdale fashion square location. She responded ""NO."" I said ok do you have that locations number. She responded ""No I don't sorry."" I'm thinking how does a hostess not have a list of their neighborhood locations?! So I look again online and accidentally called the same chipper hostess back. I asked the same question. She replied ""NO! You just called!"" I've been in the restaurant industry for a long time and in a hostess position your most important part of your job is to be nice over the phone and personable. I really cannot believe how rude she was for no reason. Shouldn't be in the customer service industry."
