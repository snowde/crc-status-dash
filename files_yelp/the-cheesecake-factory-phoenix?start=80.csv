Keith S.,"Scottsdale, AZ",19,21,11,5.0,9/14/2015,"When going to this restaurant location specifically I recommend parking in the paid parking lot across from the entrance. It will give you a little yellow token that you can validate when you are leaving and will save you the hassle of trying to find a spot in this busy location.  Now for the restaurant! This is one of my favorite restaurants to go to and the only Cheesecake Factory location I really like. The atmosphere is very lively sometimes noisy and most workers are very friendly and helpful. The lighting is rather dim in certain seating locations. I would say it is ""too romantic"" when it comes to the lighting if that was a lighting setting.  Almost all of the servers I have had in the past were great with timing, knowledge of the vast menu, friendliness and attention to your needs. The food is always great and I have never regretted my decision when ordering. The Red Sangria and Moscow Mules were perfect for drink choices. I even ordered an A.M.F. (a dangerously blue heavier alcoholic drink. Those who know understand) which was not even on the drink menu. I was surprised on how accommodating this location was. They even bring an extra plate if you are sharing a dish and have split it up before. I recommend the Shrimp Bistro Pasta or Chicken Madeira for a main entree and the Portabella, Avocado and Zucchini Fries for an appetizer. Those are just my go to choices.  The only problem, as with every other Cheesecake Factory or Man vs. Food competition, is trying to reach that last bite and in this scenario it's the cheesecake. This cheesecake is probably more total calories than all the food leading up to it and it's worth it. If you ask for a cheesecake to-go container you will put it in the fridge only to open it up before bed and finish it. I highly recommend this location and restaurant chain and don't forget to validate before leaving."
Astrid H.,"Phoenix, AZ",152,21,89,5.0,2/7/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory hardly disappoints, with their huge menu offering just about anything for the variety of palates.  I had the skinny-luscious steak medallions and they were tasty but surely small. Of course I knew I was ordering off the skinny-Lucius menu but it was quite a surprise to see how small they were. I made the mistake of ordering them medium - since they're so small they came back cooked pretty medium well (my bad).  The cucumber lemonade is where it's at! They muddle fresh lime in it and it's absolutely delicious!!! Our server Marcella couldn't hear us though. And she brought chocolate milk out for my kid even though I distinctly said white. She tried, however- it seemed."
Brittny M.,"Avondale, AZ",104,13,2,2.0,4/8/2017,"I am a fan of the cheese cake factory and I've been to this location a few times. The service is great and the food is tasty. Before my party was seated we were discussing the delicious choices of cheesecake over by the displays and noticed a dead fly on one of the cheesecakes. We informed a staff member. The fly was removed and the cheesecake was placed back on the rack to sell! I'm sure it's inevitable sometimes, but I think we were just in shock that the fly was simply picked out so nonchalantly. Needless to say when asked if we wanted to try one of their cheesecakes after our dinner we kindly declined."
Janet N.,"San Jose, CA",1809,1073,2881,3.0,9/16/2014,"It's like any other Cheesecake Factory out there, though with all the common problems I have with TCF this one stood out because of our great server, Brittaney. The bread served was good, I'm always a fan of sourdough but they were hardly warm. For apps, I had the Tuna Tartare which was good, strong in flavor but the portion was way too small for something to cost $7. It came with barely enough fried off wontons to eat with the tartare. I split the Louisiana Chicken pasta and even so the portion was filling. Good pasta with a kick to eat, creamy sauce and perfectly fried chicken.  For dessert I went with something light, so I decided on the Fresh Banana Cream Cheesecake. It was a bit too warm for my liking as I like my cheesecakes cold. The flavor was light and not too sweet though. Our server Brittaney was so nice and gave great suggestions! A great waitstaff here overall. I suppose it's just the food here that can be a hit or miss and the price point is way more than what it should be."
Amber S.,"Phoenix, AZ",137,200,67,5.0,11/1/2016,I love this place. The food is always great and no problems with service. Now I've also been able to indulge in getting it delivered.
Ryan D.,"Manhattan Beach, CA",2,35,14,4.0,3/19/2017,"After checking out of our hotel (the Arizona Biltmore, which was just a few minutes away), we wanted a nice brunch, so we came to The Cheesecake Factory. I've been to other locations, but never this one. It was clean and all the staff were very friendly and helpful. It was hard to choose from their usual huge menu, everything looked great! I had the green chilaquiles with carnitas and eggs. Unfortunately, they were cold when they brought it to our table. Luckily the kind service immediately brought them back to the kitchen and when they came out again they were very delicious (and warm!). I would definitely come back to this location for the wonderful service."
Wolfram L.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,35,17,5.0,8/28/2016,Super service within a great environment! The dinner was great for the adults and kids as well.
Colleen H.,"Phoenix, AZ",95,29,26,5.0,6/18/2016,"This was our spot for happy hour followed with dinner three times a week. Skinnylicious menu: My favorite was the fire roasted artichokes with the skinny cosmopolitan. My honey enjoyed the happy hour burger with a tall glass of Stella. Other favorites include: **Soy glazed edamame Caesar Salad Chinese chicken salad **Miso Salmon The club White chicken chili **Chicken marsala and mushrooms Tiramiso cheesecake **Pepermint bark cheesecake The bartenders rock: **John, Greg, Vince and Chase. Sit in the bar area and you're set. Great atmosphere, conversation, drinks, food and five star service."
Jered V.,"Phoenix, AZ",63,24,10,5.0,7/11/2016,Food is always great.   Never disappointed      The Louisiana pasta with the Parmesan chicken is my favorite but with the penne instead of the bow tie.   They never complain or upcharge.     A couple of times I wanted it but could get there so I used door dash to deliver.  Great partnership.  Love it.   Always coming back to that fantastic place.
Stephanie E.,"Kihei, HI",89,23,5,5.0,2/4/2017,Tried the new super antioxidant salad... AMAZING!!! No meat or cheese in it ... But very filling!
Stevenandjanet L.,"Glendale, AZ",0,17,,3.0,1/21/2017,Nothing to complain about. We had some cheesecake and coffee just before close. Got a table right away and the service was good.
Stephanie B.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,88,14,5.0,7/31/2017,Asian lettuce tacos were amazing and the sauces to go with them were great compliments.
Marlo M.,"Palmdale, CA",17,517,1495,5.0,7/2/2016,Consistency consistancy wow what more can I say I've never had a bad meal at Cheesecake Factory I often wonder how do they do it with such a large menu the food is made quickly and fresh and always taste great.
Rob K.,"Mesa, AZ",0,8,,1.0,11/20/2016,"Went out for a date night, which was going well until my very last bite. Chomping down on what I thought was the end of a lovely dinner turned into disgust as I realized that something in that bite wasn't food. Never really figured out what that plastic piece was, but the end of dinner was pretty well ruined for me at that point. The waitress was very apologetic, but the manager never came out to apologize and just comped my own meal."
Ruth L.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,12,,5.0,2/19/2017,"Great service  despite 20 minute wait for  a table on an early Sunday evening. Server recommended Cobb salad, which turned out to be awesome, large and filling, Unfortunately no space left for cheesecake :("
G C.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,51,1,3.0,7/27/2017,"This is one of my more favorite places to go.  Decent menu selection and I love the Caesar salad dressing.  Tonight however I was less than impressed.  Our server was lacking.   He was not very attentive and slow in some cases chit chatting with some tables when other tables were waiting    Another server in the adjoining section was on spot.   He will get a less than typical tip from me as he said he would bring the check but it's been over 8 mins already and still waiting.  Finally it came. Wonder how long we wait to cash out.  He'll be getting less than 15% now.  Shame, this place usually has good service but maybe that's only when the server is female and can multitask.    Rating is 3 stars cause food was decent but service sub par.  And took 5 more mins for him to come pick up the check.  I was so bothered I brought it to the attention of the hostess to inform management"
Jackie B.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,5,1,5.0,10/2/2016,"We love this restaurant! Always impeccable service, consistently good food and great atmosphere for lunch or dinner. Favorite appetizer: Ahi Carpaccio. The kale and salmon salad is always a winner and the veggie melt is one of the best vegetarian dishes I've had a chain restaurant. Of course the cheesecake is amazing. Lemon raspberry will give you just enough to satisfy your sweet tooth while still feeling light and fresh."
Leah L.,"Las Vegas, NV",11,15,,1.0,3/8/2016,"We had a VERY disappointing experience here Friday night. I called just after they opened to see if I could bring in a cake for our server to bring to our table for my daughter's birthday. The manager I spoke to was pleasant and confirmed that, yes, I could bring in my own cake, and just let our server know that I had brought it in.  I took the cake and bday candles to them early in the afternoon, and the hostess who took it made a note that it was mine and then put it in their fridge up front.  Once we arrived that evening, I spoke to the hostess (on the DL, so my daughter would be surprised), and asked her to tell our server Brandon that the cake was for my daughter and to bring it out with the candles in it after dinner. The hostess followed me back to my table so she was sure to talk to the right server about the right table/party.  Dinner came and went. It was all very good, but expensive, which is expected there. Then the bill came, and I tipped about 25% because I appreciated the extra trouble of them letting me bring in my own cake, etc.  But after the server took my money, we never saw him again - and no one ever brought out her cake!! NOTHING!! After we waited a while and realized it wasn't happening, we decided to leave. When I stopped at the front and explained what happened (or what didn't happen) and asked for my cake back, the man at the counter casually handed it back without making any effort to make the situation right!!!  I was so disappointed and felt so bad for my daughter to not get the the birthday fun I thought I had set up for her.  Bad job, Brandon and Cheesecake Factory. You really dropped the ball.  The next day I wanted to complete the online survey about my experience, but realized too late that having the receipt handy is required, and I didn't have it."
Peggy N.,"Scottsdale, AZ",21,1,,3.0,1/5/2017,Service was good but when my daughter lost her parking token they were useless. Even though we had just dropped a $100 for a meal my daughter had to spend another $16 to get out of the lot. Comon folks lets get with technology! A validation shoukd be validated if warranted. Period!
