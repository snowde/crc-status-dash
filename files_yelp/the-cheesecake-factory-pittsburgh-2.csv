Kashiff M.,"Pittsburgh, PA",107,27,44,5.0,11/5/2017,Cheesecake Factory is da bomb!! The ambiance when I walked in was inviting and the hostess welcomed us to sit anywhere in the bar area. We figured it'd be a lengthy wait on a Sunday during brunch but we were pleased to sit down at a high top right away. Our server John was excellent! He kept our glasses full and bread on the table.  I ordered the Breakfast Burrito that stuffed me half way through. My date ordered the Farm Fresh Eggs with potatoes and bacon on a plate the size of Texas. Everything was amazing and we offered cheesecake to go of course.  I can't wait to go back next Sunday for brunch with more friends!
Valerie V.,"Boston, PA",35,97,325,5.0,10/22/2017,If I had to sum up my many experiences at this Cheesecake Factory in only a few words I would say they consistently exceed my expectations and delivering excellent meals and service with a large menu. I have never ordered anything that I didn't completely enjoy and the portions are enormous. The chicken buffalo pastry app is fantastic as is the southwest egg roll.
Taylor K.,"Pittsburgh, PA",76,87,145,4.0,7/13/2017,"I am always so satisfied with my experiences at The Cheesecake Factory. This location in South Side is the same way. Great happy hour deals - a number of apps are $6 (happy hour is only in the bar area). We tried the Buffalo chicken bombs on my most recent trip this week and they were SO YUM - fried and served with blue cheese.  My only complaint in this area is the parking is a headache. Cheesecake Factory doesn't have a lot. Plenty of garages around, but just not ideal."
Rebecca C.,"Pittsburgh, PA",14,4,,5.0,1/5/2018,"The Southside location is just amazing.  Our waitress Tasha was fabulous, very personable and knowledgeable about the menu.  This was my husband's and I's first time here and we will definitely be returning."
Tori L.,"Covington, KY",138,30,39,4.0,10/13/2017,"As common as the Cheesecake Factory is.. I mean every outdoor mall or shopping ""town center""... but anyway, I try to avoid mega-chains like this, but honestly, it's super good. Get past the fake Italian rustic wallpaper and you've got page after page of menu items to choose from. Their salads are unique and packed with stuff - my mom, sister and I went out to lunch together and each got a different salad, all three satisfying. Cheesecake aside, they actually do a good job with their restaurant food."
Kelly M.,"Pittsburgh, PA",47,113,201,3.0,4/28/2017,"Let me just say I get so annoyed when my SO suggests to go here because I spend a half hour just trying to read the menu- it is 21 pages. Literally the most frustrating thing about the Factory- even after you decide you immediately wonder if you should have scanned the menu one more time!  We started off with the crab/artichoke dip with soft baguette slices. It was good, but nowhere near the best crab dip we have had. To their credit it did have a very generous amount of crab! I always have to have a side salad with my dinner; it's just mandatory for me! I decided on the tossed salad, though I really wanted the Greek salad. For only 6.95, this salad was huge! A bit more than your typical side salad but that's because it's way bigger. Although I would give it 5/5, it was unfortunate that I just couldn't eat it all because I still needed to eat my meal! I got the Pasta Da Vinci for my entree; I love mushrooms and was excited to see a variety of different types of mushrooms in a pasta dish. The mushrooms were incredible, and the grilled chicken was cooked very well, but the sauce was very bland. It was okay, but nothing spectacular. My SO enjoyed his dinner; he said the shrimp scampi was one of the best things he's ever eaten! The mashed potatoes were okay, but not very creamy, more lumpy and a bit dry. Some pieces of his steak were cooked perfectly, while others were a bit tough. All-in-all, with Cheesecake Factory, I just wasn't blown away with the food, especially for the (dinner) price."
Michael E.,"Pittsburgh, PA",114,56,58,4.0,7/7/2017,"For sophistication's sake, I want to give The Cheesecake Factory 3 stars, but let's be honest . . . I love this restaurant.  This location is great because when waiting 3+ hrs you can walk around REI or stare at shooting water in the southside works while you wait. There's a lot of great shops to meander around while trying to kill time. A con, however, is they still use the taser-looking bricks instead of texting you. (You guys should fix that.)  Inside decor. Lavish. Unique. Kind of gaudy. But I like it. Honestly, you look up and wonder if you're in the Sistine Chapel. Brilliant. Who paints that? And more importantly, you cannot help but wonder if your booth is housing a dinosaur egg or if youre eating under the menacing eye of Saruman (if you have no clue what I'm taking about, you cannot unsee it when you do.)  Both options are exciting.  A part of me truly judges the person who says they don't like The Cheesecake Factory. Why? Saying you don't like The Cheesecake Factory is like saying you don't like food - because the menu covers every discipline of food making. Honestly, the thing is an encyclopedia. If you are indecisive, you need to look at the menu and have a game plan before entering. Otherwise, you will be there all night just trying to decide. If you don't know what to get, I suggest one of two options (and really both if you're me).  1. Order the Crusted Chicken Romano. It may not be the most adventurous option, but I am willing to say it is the best. Delicious. Massive. Caloric.  2. Just keep eating the refillable bread baskets. They serve a wheat that is to die for. *Lifehack: when the bowl of butter comes out, grab two of those packets and place one behind each knee - otherwise you might as well try to spread a hardened slab of concrete on your bread.  If you can eat all your food, you may want to (scratch that), always order Cheesecake. They're all good and there are about 7,000 options. I love the raspberry white chocolate, and I usually order it to go.  Southside parking on the street is free at random times, so make sure you check the meters. If you don't mind walking a couple blocks, Sarah St. will save you from paying for parking if you are crazy about that like I am. If you're not, they have multiple parking garages in the area AND a valet (they used to even validate parking garage tickets, so look into that!).  Cheesecake Factory... quantity, quantity, good quality, and always an experience. Check. It. Out."
Eva R.,"Pittsburgh, PA",291,253,618,4.0,1/18/2017,"A must go to for anyone who loves cheesecake. Their menu is extensive, so everyone should be able to find something on the menu. My favorite appetizer to share is the eggroll sampler. The avocado egg roll is amazing and creamy. The salmon firecracker roll containers perfectly cooked salmon in a crispy wrapper. It also comes with the cuban egg roll, tex mex egg roll, and plenty of dipping sauces.  The Louisiana Chicken pasta was very heavy and ginormous, so I had leftovers. The pasta dish was fine, nothing special. Sometimes I just don't even get an entree to save room for cheesecake.  My favorite cheesecake is probably the Mango Key Lime Cheesecake. The crust is made with coconut macaroons, then there is the mango cheesecake, and on top is a smooth mango mousse. The cheesecake is a light and refreshing way to end the meal. It is not too sweet or artificial tasting. I have also had the cookie dough cheesecake, which is good but not out of this world."
Cynthia S.,"Mount Pleasant, SC",36,67,68,5.0,6/10/2017,"Ahh one of my favorite chains.  When I'm home visiting family everyone knows this is a must stop for me. I have NEVER been disappointed by their food, drinks, service or ambiance. Dining with a large party is always a challenge, but not here! They go out of their way to accommodate and provide the appropriate number of wait staff.  Hats off to the kitchen because all 9 entrees were delicious.  Being a food and nutritionally aware diner I appreciate the calorie count and the lighter fare...especially the Ahi Tuna Tartare.  Thank you Cheesecake Factory for serving me another great evening!"
Tyoko B.,"Pittsburgh, PA",145,267,791,5.0,10/23/2016,"I've visited this Cheesecake Factory on several occasions and really shocked to see I haven't reviewed yet so, here goes... This location is situated smack dab in the middle of Southside Works and has a classy kinda feel to it. It's beautiful inside and I love how some of the seating is very intimate. The service here is always great which leads me to believe whoever is running this one knows what they are doing and they're employees are happy...it shows.  The food was soooo good. My order of chicken piccata had that burst of fresh lemon and caper sauce with a side of angel hair. The chicken was moist and tender and absorbed the light sauce well. On a final note, get here early on a Saturday night because the wait is LONG. No reservations are accepted on the weekends. With that said, if you have good company to keep your attention, the wait is a non-issue :)"
Ashley S.,"Denver, CO",270,55,76,1.0,12/8/2016,"Ordered the Garlic Noodles and had a super long hair in my food... was told the manager was going to come over and take care of it. Manager never arrived. My waitress was sweet and professional, and she got me a replacement order of noodles. Bartender was nice as well. Sad that the manager on duty, whoever he or she is, never took care of the situation. Can't believe I had to pay for this food. Love the Cheesecake Factory, but I'm not impressed with the management at this location."
Kanchan B.,"Orlando, FL",315,1151,4951,3.0,9/25/2016,"I was forced to come here as needed to use the Loo and I felt super guilty afterwards so went to the bar and got a coffee for $4!! Honestly, at times like this, I recall with much fondness the EU system, where I pay my 50 cents but don't end up having to get things I really didn't want in the first place. But I'm digressing - so I must say this Cheesecake Factory is gorgeously decorated and walks very spacious. Also due to the the French widows, the interior is flooded with light.  My experience at the bar getting the coffee was eh. They were super busy and I was obviously a lower cost ticket than others siting at the bar. Also the coffee description in the menu did not live up to its hype - I wasn't a massive fan of the coffee beans used so will definitely not be getting it again.  Note: #335 of Yelp 100 challenge for 2016"
Sherry M.,"Pittsburgh, PA",37,223,992,4.0,5/26/2017,"I can only comment on the cheesecake. We have had dinner there once or twice, but I found nothing negative or glowing to say about the dinners. It's always to crowded to make this place on our restaurant rotation list.  I LOVE the cheesecake. Either eat in or take out, it is such a treat! We mostly like to take the dessert out, less crowded and have it in the peace and quite of a hotel room near by or at home. I love the Raspberry/Chocolate every time ! True fan and will continue to eat Cheesecake and recommend to family and friends."
James D.,"Smithfield, PA",1,113,1693,5.0,5/25/2017,"Best place to eat on the Southside of Pittsburgh... We are always getting gift cards to this place, but always seem to leave them at home. There's always a wait of 30-45 minutes here, so don't be in a hurry when you arrive... Parking is always an issue, download the Pittsburgh parking APP and save yourself a headache... The best advice I can give a party of 4 or less, there's a 1st come 1st serve policy on the hightop tables in the bar area... We've avoided long lines many times by grabbing one as people were leaving... We've never ordered anything on their extensive menu that was disappointing!!! Enjoy"
Kellie U.,"McKeesport, PA",46,35,50,5.0,5/4/2017,"The cheesecake is pretty much always on point at The Cheesecake Factory. It just depends on what you prefer. My favorites are the fresh banana cream, the tiramisu, and the red velvet cheesecake. If you go for a meal, their portions are always pretty big. You'll definitely have to take food home. The menu is huge, so it might be a good idea to check it out online before you go, especially if you're really hungry."
Kaitlin B.,"Pittsburgh, PA",32,54,20,4.0,8/16/2017,"Always a fantastic happy hour! I do wish they'd expand their happy hour white wines, and the food options; but for $6 (normally $10), you can't beat the price for a glass of wine!"
Xiaona F.,"Pittsburgh, PA",11,5,39,4.0,4/20/2017,"I wanted to try Cheesecake Factory since I knew it was the restaurant where Penny work in the Big Bang theory show, and finally I made it.  And thanks to recommendations given by yelpers, the mango key lime cheesecake didn't let me down. I love every food with mango in it. Even though I was told the cake here are too sweet for low sweet threshold Chinese people, this one I tried is bearable.  My friend ordered the toasted pear and blue cheese flat bread which looks like a mini pizza. The flavor of blue cheese was not that sharp and salty as I imagined, probably neutralized by sweet pears. The distinct flavors getting together is unique, and it really deserves a try.  Also I tried their salads, nothing special other than the beets, I love their purple color and the light sweet flavor."
Alane R.,"Pittsburgh, PA",58,57,71,4.0,12/23/2016,Ordered the eggplant dinner with pesto past on the side! I was pretty excited because I've only been here one other time before I wrote Yelp reviews. The pasta was good but mostly tasted like garlic. The eggplant was great but a little to salty for my. I only dyed a little because I had to save room for the delicious peppermint cheesecake that had candy canes crushed up on top! Yum! FYI everyone on Saturday they will not validate parking because the parking is 3 dollars on Saturday.. kinda annoying that I just spent $30.00 on dinner and you won't validate my 3.00 because it's Saturday.. but you would if it was Friday.  Had a good time with my friends overall.
Lisa M.,"West Mifflin, PA",0,14,20,5.0,8/14/2017,"There is usually a wait here so be prepared.  The food is excellent.  Dana is a great server but if she's not there, we can get some great conversations from the bartenders eating at the bar   (shes boisterous, he's quiet but a nice dry wit).  The cheesecakes are all delicious, you cant go wrong!!  The Chicken Farfalle pasta is my favorite!!  These bartenders make the best mai tais!!"
Adelina M.,"Pittsburgh, PA",337,250,563,5.0,10/22/2016,"Wowza. Ok. So I came here with a reservation for 13 because we were celebrating a work milestone. Seriously, 13 people! I commend the Cheesecake Factory for being so open, welcoming, and accommodating to us. I could not even remember the last time that I came here. I believe it was about 2 or 3 years ago because we came after my friend picked out a wedding dress to celebrate. I am really surprised after this last visit that we don't come more often. Granted, the South Side area that it is in sometimes the parking can be annoying, so maybe that is it? I look forward to coming back here though! We all looked over the menu before we got there. With this place the menu is about the size of a novel so you have to at least glance at it to get oriented to what you might want to eat.  Appetizers: EGGROLL SAMPLER: A Variety of All of Our Eggrolls with Avocado, Tex Mex, Crispy Cuban and Firecracker Salmon.: YUM. I got to try the firecracker salmon and the avocado. The avocado was amazing. Seriously, and that dipping sauce, totally on point. This was a nice sampler and each of the eggrolls were cut into two so we got to try more than one of the rolls. I liked the sauces as much as I liked the eggrolls! GUACAMOLE MADE-TO-ORDER:Ripe Avocado, Onion, Tomato, Chiles, Cilantro and Fresh Lime. Served with Tortilla Chips, Salsa and Sour Cream.: Wowza, this guacamole was hot! The jalapenos in the guacamole were spicy! I mean, I liked it but dang it had some fire. I liked that the plate came with a lot of chips. I hate it when you get guacamole or even salsa and you have to keep on asking for more chips in order for the table to finish the dish, small annoyance but still.  Entree: CHICKEN BELLAGIO:Crispy Coated Chicken Breast over Basil Pasta and Parmesan Cream Sauce Topped with Prosciutto and Arugula Salad: OMG.YES.YES.YES. I wanted to go with another chicken dish but the waitress described it as, ""eh"" and the Chicken Bellagio, my second choice, she described as, ""favorite thing on the menu"". I had to then of course pick the Chicken Bellagio. I am so happy I did. First, the dinner portion was huge. The chicken came in two pounded out thin breasts so I just put one and half the pasta into a box right away so I wouldn't be tempted to eat it. This dish was banging. Seriously. The Parmesan cream sauce was delish and the basil pasta was not overwhelming at all. It was a very subtle flavor. The chicken was pounded thin and was a crisp perfection. I loved the salad that topped the dish. It added some live green to the dish that complemented everything really well. YUM. The only thing is, the prosciutto was in strips. I wish that it was cut up maybe just a little. It was hard to cut through, as prosciutto usually is so smaller pieces might have made the dish a bit easier to eat. I did not eat any dessert because after the fresh bread at the table, the apps, and the dinner, I could not fit another thing into my belly.  I know that I am usually not the biggest fan of chain restaurants but  this was a great experience and the food was AWESOME. I look forward to my next trip to the Cheesecake Factory."
Hemant U.,"Middleburg Heights, OH",16,23,12,5.0,6/10/2017,"I have been there multiple times to have their cheesecake but today, I went there for lunch. Oh boy.. the food was delicious and the service was awesome."
Chardae J.,"Pittsburgh, PA",136,143,95,5.0,5/16/2017,I don't consider The Cheesecake Factory fine dining and no one should. Their pride and joy is in their very name and they do it well. Find a friend and I bet you they have their go to cheesecake. My favorite is the turtle cheesecake hands down. Sometimes when I'm meeting friends here and I know I won't have room for the cheesecake I just take it to go. Also the avocado egg rolls are so good that I don't trust anyone that says otherwise. Me and my friends have a stare down over the last one. I also appreciate good service. Not once have I had a bad experience at The Cheesecake Factory and I appreciate it thar because it's just as much about the experience as it is the food.
Gina W.,"Pittsburgh, PA",79,10,19,4.0,5/2/2017,"I enjoy a great experience at a chain restaurant now and then and I have never been disappointed with my experience at this Cheesecake Factory. The managers obviously take great steps to hire a friendly staff. Our waitress, Kim C., was so wonderful with us and really made our experience enjoyable.  I know I can always rely on quality food from the CF. The menu is very large and can be daunting if you don't know what you're in the mood for. I had a glass of red sangria and it was so delicious, the best part were the soaked apples in the bottom. For an entree, I ordered the Thai Lettuce Wraps and they were fabulous like always. It's a very filling meal and enough to share or to make into two meals, leaving you with leftovers."
Chris H.,"Pittsburgh, PA",60,99,217,4.0,2/17/2016,"Why does everyone hate on the Cheesecake Factory? I like privately owned, farm to table, tapas as much as the next food snob, but I like The Cheesecake Factory. And a lot of other (maybe not food snobs) do too. How do I know this? Try getting a table anytime and see how long the wait is. Try getting a table on a Friday/Saturday or even a seat at the bar OR even a seat in their waiting area and it'll take an hour (at least). So that's annoying, but you can also make reservations or do take out. And it's not like you weren't warned.  Anyway, I like the food. I've enjoyed most of the appetizers and entrees I've had. I've also had maybe 20 Oreo cheesecake slices in the last three years so hopefully that tells you something about the (Oreo) cheesecake. Occasionally someone I'm with doesn't like their food, but that's not typically what happens. Besides the wait, the service occasionally leaves something to be desired. My last interaction was over the phone for take out and it was pretty good, except this awkward moment where I said ""can I have the Americana burger sub a veggie patty?"" And the lady on the other end goes ""do you just want the veggie burger?"" And in my head I was an a**hole and responded with 'No, that's why I asked for the Americana burger.' Externally, I realized she thought I might have missed the veggie option on the menu (or maybe they try to discourage substitutions) and responded with a proper ""No thanks, I would like the Americana burger with a veggie patty."" And, if anyone is wondering- I've had the Americana burger with a veggie patty maybe four times now and have been satisfied with my choice of entree and restaurant each time.  The well drinks are also good, but keep in mind if you order a specialty cocktail it will have at least half the amount of alcohol you expect for twice the price."
Sneha N.,"Pittsburgh, PA",26,86,123,4.0,4/16/2017,"Excellent ambience, food and service. I like the spread of food selection they offer.  But, still the quality of food is not compromised."
Monica S.,"Pittsburgh, PA",47,56,265,4.0,2/12/2016,"Our server was Stella. I ordered the filet mignon, medium rare. We had avocado egg roll and fried calamari for our appetizers, which was very good! The egg roll was surprisingly very delicious. I got their newest (?) cheesecake, the salted caramel cheesecake. It was on the sweet side, so if that's what you're going for I'd give it a try. Our server was more than happy to give us advice on our entrees. We came on a Friday during Valentines weekend for a friend's birthday. At first she forgot to sing happy birthday for our friend, but it worked out in the end. It was quite busy, but we got seated within 20-30 minutes. We had a party of 7, we sat in a 6 person booth and they added a seat to the end.  It took about 20 minutes for us to receive our main entrees. Thank you Stella for giving us great service ."
Karla D.,"Pittsburgh, PA",337,918,2094,3.0,1/26/2017,"I remember when TCF first came to Pittsburgh. Having been to them all of the country I thought it was about time. But the novelty wore off for me a long time ago. The food is ok. Nothing out of this world. Typical fare. However, when it comes to the cheesecake that's a different story. Never have I had a bad piece and I've had several. Really very decent for  box establishment."
Misha R.,"Pittsburgh, PA",53,39,123,5.0,3/14/2017,I love  sweets  and this place has my favorite cake Mango  Key lime  and Original cheese cake always clean and nice
Ron B.,"Williamsport, PA",111,4,2,1.0,4/16/2017,"Wow. Horrible. Horrible. Horrible. We went there tonight for the wife's birthday. First they run out of what 2 people ordered - telling us well after the order was placed (oh well not a huge deal) then they send out the two other meals (party of 4) and they were both stone cold. Sent the orders back. After a long wait they finally brough the replacements. One of the meals was completely undercooked (actually uncooked). To top things off one of our party has very strict dietary issues (which we made a point of letting them know when ordering) and cannot eat meat. His meal ended up having chicken in it!!!! How many strikes? 4!!!! Unreal. Waitress handled things correctly, unfortunately Management could not have been more cold and uncaring. They ended up not charging us but probably would not have done that if I hadn't said I wasn't paying. Amazingly bad.  Very disappointing and poorly handled. I have only been there a few times but can assure that I will never go there again."
Deborah T.,"McKeesport, PA",21,2,2,5.0,4/8/2017,"It was busy, but we were seated quickly. Great food and great service. Our server,  Sage, was great, funny and provided awesome service! We absolutely adored her! Will be back again!!"
Kimberly T.,"Downtown, Pittsburgh, PA",736,642,2139,4.0,4/18/2016,So many people like to eat at the Cheesecake Factory that there is always a wait. I don't mind waiting for good food. They have an extensive menu. It's probably the biggest menu I have ever seen. I believe instead of a huge menu of mediocre food that it would be better to have a smaller menu of really good food. So the last two times I have gone to The Cheesecake Factory I went in and got cheesecake to go. I tried the Cookie Dough flavor and they aren't kidding-there was a lot of cookie dough. In fact there was very little cheesecake compared to cookie dough. It was clunky and I wasn't a huge fan. The second trip I got Key Lime cheesecake. It is amazing. It's definitely one of my top 2 favorites. It is tangy and has a little bit of zing to it. It is refreshing during the warmer weather. There is a huge list of flavored to try. I can't wait to try other flavors.
Lambert P.,"Toronto, Canada",387,1093,4867,4.0,8/4/2015,"I've been to this particular Cheesecake Factory maybe 5 or 6 times now.  I love this place regardless that it's a chain because it's one of the higher quality bang for the buck type of restaurants.  This one's a bit different in that it's a standalone building in what seems to be the centerpiece of Southside Works with a mini water fountain type plaza in the front. We came on a Sunday around 3:30pm this time around and there wasn't really a wait at all.  Originally we were just going to have dessert but I'm not really one for sweets so I ended up getting my favorite dish which is the hibachi steak.   The Cheesecake Factory's menu is crazy and has a wide variety of things to choose from but as of late and for as often as we go I always seem to gravitate towards this same dish.  It looked a little different this time around as the steak although still sliced, wasn't scattered and was pretty much left as a whole.  The asparagus were smaller cut spears than previously which seemed to be about 2 or 3 whole spears tempura battered and fried.  The mashed potatoes seemed the same as before but with much more wasabi butter as usual which I did not mind at all.  The steak is sliced, with sprouts and mushrooms in a sugar and soy type of sauce.  Delicious! Overall this is my favorite dish and while I've had many at many Cheesecake Factories all over the continent this is still my fall back menu item and I love it.  Everybody that has ever had a taste of my dish it pretty much became their favorite dish too OR they said it was amazing.   The service at this particular Cheesecake and pretty much all for that matter is always great.  The floor here much like many I've been to before as well seems slippery, greasy or whatever.  I don't know what it is but if you have deck shoes here it could be dangerous!   They pretty much all have the same decor and lighting, the foods basically all the same and so is the service.  Still as good as it gets for medium priced sit down chains and I'm looking forward to when they finally come up to Toronto in the near future.   Wifi would be nice considering people come from all over to eat here and the place is large."
Tracy K.,"Dayton, OH",12,29,7,1.0,4/27/2017,"Interesting meal with my family. First the appetizer was not prepared properly, out of the lemon chicken and then vegetables were cold. Overall should be zero stars. Made a comment on corporate site and next thing I know, the manager that was so crappy is stalking my linked in page. So if you make a complaint expect the managers to look you up. Little cyber stalking to go with crappy meal."
Mackenzie K.,"Alexandria, VA",456,282,583,4.0,2/17/2016,"I'm a die hard Cheesecake Factory fan. That being said this isn't their greatest location. Yes, it's on south side, but if you plan on doing more then going to AE, Sur La Table or Houghbrah House there's not to much to do. There used to be tons of shops/ other restaurants right in the surrounding blocks but since then has seen a down turn.  It's quite a far walk to the ""real"" south side ( all the bars) but I suppose in the summer months you could make it happen. The food is the same food you'd get at any other location, good size, good taste for the price.  Since this is the only location in downtown Pittsburgh it does get quite busy, so put your name on the list and have a drink in the bar area while you wait! The high tops in the bar are first come first serve, so elbow your way into one! :)"
Paul M.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,28,44,4.0,11/26/2016,"Came on a busy night with a large party (11)   Wait time was reasonable. Food and service was fantastic. Way to go Cheesecake Factory , an excellent experience! Fantastic job, from tasty fresh guac, to salmon entree and of course dessert and coffee ."
carl k.,"Pittsburgh, PA",271,7,,2.0,11/13/2016,Food can be decent but when we go to pick up it takes longer to get through the line and order than to actually cook the food.  What is frustrating is that there seems to be groups of employees standing around while people wait to order  Having worked in restaurants much of my life I would just urge them to use their resources a bit more efficiently
B T.,"Rome, GA",2,77,1,4.0,6/2/2017,Had the chicken marsala. It was good. Had the Godiva chocolate cheesecake for dessert. It was very rich but good.
Nancy W.,"Pittsburgh, PA",14,17,12,1.0,2/11/2017,Here now for our mothers 83rd birthday party. Put our name in for 18 and they're now telling us they won't hold our table past noon because not everyone in our party is here yet.  Guess they don't want our hundreds of dollars in business.
Laila Z.,"Alexandria, VA",0,9,,1.0,11/22/2017,"I have been to The Cheesecake Factory locations all over the country, but I have to say the manager, Jason, was the most unprofessional manager I have ever come across. I ordered over $100 worth of take out. Once I got the food home, I noticed that the avocados were missing from both of the chicken and avocado salads. I called the restaurant and spoke to Jason. To start, Jason voiced that they only add 2 ounces of avocados to a a salad that has avocados listed in the name.  He was rude and did not offer an apology for the error.  Jason then asked me to come back all the way from home to pick up my 2 ounces of avocados for each salad.  After I told him I was too far to return, he stated he would send me a gift card worth $20 for what he stated was for two slices of free cheesecake. He did not even care that I paid $15 for each salad and spent over $100 overall. He disregarded my cost and said he was only sending the card for the missing avocados. I told Jason his disregard was unprofessional and that I would write to corporate. He said to go ahead and started playing with the telephones buttons, pretending he was having phone issues, and hung up. Jason is not management material. Needless to say, I will not go back to this location as long as the restaurant is managed by a person who is clearly not cut out for management."
