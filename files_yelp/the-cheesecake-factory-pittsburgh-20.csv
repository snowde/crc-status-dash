Emily H.,"Chicago, IL",38,192,12,1.0,9/14/2008,"I visited here with my family, and thankfully the wait was not too long.  (I've visited the one in Columbus and the wait on a weekend is still 3 hours, years after it opened.)  We didn't think much of the atmosphere - it was quiet and very dark, almost to the point where you couldn't see what you were eating. I ordered a pasta but requested no nuts on top, due to my allergies, which I made clear to the waitress.  Because the restaurant was so dark, I didn't realize right away that there were nuts on it, but when the waitress came around again, I had to send my food back.  This always leads to awkwardness - do your dining companions keep eating, or do they let their food get cold while you're waiting for a new dish?  The manager apologized but we were still charged for the meal.  We thought the least he could do would be to comp it, as the whole incident considerably disrupted our dinner and it was the fault of either the waitress or kitchen staff.  But we decided to not make a fuss.  We ordered cheesecake to go, as we were full. Once I got home, I dug into my Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough cheesecake.  At the time (this was several years ago), the menu did not mention that the cookie dough contained walnuts.  There was no little asterisk, no caution from the waitress, nothing.  I probably should have asked, but normally chocolate chip cookie dough does not contain walnuts, and with food allergies on the rise I feel that a restaurant should warn its patrons.  I made a complaint on the website and received a $25 gift card. I haven't been back since, not because I'm boycotting but more because I don't find anything particularly fabulous about the menu and the wait times can be ridiculous.  But I did want to warn anyone with food allergies to be very careful about what they order, and to double-check with your waiter/waitress to avoid any bad reactions."
Angela C.,"Forest Hills, Queens, NY",124,260,8,3.0,3/13/2007,"I'm not really a huge fan of Cheesecake Factory. The cheesecake really is good, and of course their selection can make anyone happy. Their food is reliable, and seems to be pretty consistent across all the franchises so you always know what to expect. I guess I'm just not a fan of the hype. This one is no different, but the location is cool.  For those of you who don't know, South Side Works is an up-and-coming area just outside of downtown Pittsburgh across the river from Oakland. If you want a good slice of cheesecake, go to Cheesecake Factory. But there are a few other restaurants around the neighborhood, so check those out before dessert."
Tricia S.,"Pittsburgh, PA",86,38,,4.0,12/2/2007,"Of the three Cheesecake Factory's I've been to, including Vegas, this one is my favorite.  Nestled in the heart of South Side Works it's a great place to stop while shopping, seeing a movie at the cinema across the street, a free outdoor evening concert in 'Town Square' out front, or for a special Sunday brunch. Valet parking makes dropping by for just the restaurant convenient, though for a longer shopping excursion you might opt for the SSW garage within strolling distance on a nice day. The interior is a tad more grandiose than the other two locations I've been to and its this scale that, IMHO, makes the venue seem a little less chaotic even when the cue is flowing out the doors. My menu favorites: Avocado Eggroll appetizer, Grilled Shrimp & Bacon Club w/fries (I always wind up taking half of this home), and their absolutely divine Lemoncello Cream Torte. Sorry, with Lemoncello Cream Torte on the menu who needs sex, er um, cheesecake, but if you must - the Banana Cream or Key Lime cheesecakes are sure to curl your toes. ;)"
Nisha G.,"Renton, WA",0,26,,2.0,5/15/2012,"I have previously enjoyed this place but tonight, it was bad...heres the storyHello, We visited your restaurant for our 2nd wedding anniversary, because we have always enjoyed our food and time there.  However, tonight was a bit disappointing.  My husband spent more than i would have on his dinner, a steak and it showed up on a small plate, with basil or something, that looked old. The steak itself had lots of fat on it he had to trim off himself, and the steak overall did not taste great.  This was after waiting about 5 minutes for our server to notice we were not eating because my husbands side dish had not arrived.  When she finally brought it over it was plain french fries! Are you kidding me?!  For $25.00!!!  What a joke.  They looked like frozen, out of a bag fries.  Secondly our service was pretty bad, we asked for straws, they were pretty much thrown at us, and so was the bottle of ketchup.  Wasn't the nice dining experience we were hoping for."
A L.,"San Francisco, CA",8,226,,3.0,7/22/2007,Only one thing to say: Lemoncello cream torte.   My sole reason for entering the restaurant.
Teresa T.,"Pittsburgh, PA",127,365,,3.0,9/5/2011,"After a long flight back to Pittsburgh, I decided to take out as oppose to buying groceries and making dinner. The South Side location like all other Cheesecake Factories that I have been to are grand in the decor. I do like the architecture on both the exterior and interior. After arriving inside, the main hostess greets me with a smile and points to where I would order out. The line was long and I was about 10-15 minutes away from getting to the front. The woman at the cashier was friendly and professional and offered the free bread with my order (yes please!). After 20 minutes, I got my eggplant sandwich with fries and bread and went home. Everything was delicious though by the time I got back to eat the sandwich it was soggy and the fries were nothing to rave about. I did as I always do enjoy the bread. Cheesecake Factory is a good restaurant that does the job (perfect to bring family since they offer many options to cater to everyone's taste buds and large portions) though I am unlikely to seek it out for a great meal."
Phil M.,"San Carlos, CA",5,49,1,4.0,12/24/2010,"Had a very good experience here last night with a large group of about 10.  The food was very good, the usual Cheesecake Factory menu.  The service was what made the experience excellent though.  The waitress was very nice, she didn't even flinch when we asked her to split the check about 5 ways."
Raven M.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,3,,1.0,6/19/2011,"I love the food at this restaurant and have been there quite a few times. However, my last experience there was disturbing and I experienced the worst service I've ever had in my entire life. First of all we were told it was a 40 min wait. That was fine, we waited. After we got seated, we were there for 2 1/2 hours!!! And all we ordered was dinner. No appetizers, no dessert, no cocktails (well my friend had one cocktail, that's it.)  Our waiter, Joe was not attentive to us at all. Im guessing its because we ordered water for our drinks and we are in our early 20's so he probably assumed we weren't going to tip well. (were all in the service industry and usually tip between 20-30%, little did he know). He tended to every single table around us and would look at us and then walk away. He looked at us and walked away more than 8 times, to the point when we finally got our food wrapped and he asked if we wanted dessert we said no because we didn't want to wait another hour and decided it would be faster to go to the dessert bar and get it ourselves. The only person that was attentive but not in a good way, was the bus boy who tried to take our plates 5 mintues after we started eating. By the time we left I was so annoyed that I dont care how good the food is I wont go back. The most disturbing part, however, to this whole expierence was I actually witnessed a bus boy drop clean silverware on the floor, pick it up, and put it back to be rolled up as if it were still clean. THAT'S DISGUSTING!!!! Im appalled that this is supposed to be a high class restaurant but yet has the worst service and is dirty."
Haya E.,"Bethel Park, PA",0,4,,4.0,2/2/2010,"I've been here several times but I'm writing a review for the Sunday Brunch.  Yes, I like an occaisional diner or ""dive"" for breakfast after church but sometimes I like to have a nicely prepared breakfast in an visually attractive place where I can stay as long as I choose.  The Brunch menu isn't extensive but the food is freshly prepared and there are no lines to wait in because of the time of day-so it's relatively quiet.  It's nice not to have to hear the clinging and clanging of kitchen activity while eating.  Great for a sunday morning change of pace, an intimate conversation with friends or relatives or a short business meeting."
A M.,"Pittsburgh, PA",44,209,7,3.0,5/21/2008,"I sooo wanted to dislike this place.  It just seemed kind of silly when I heard of people waiting two hours to eat at what I thought was essentially a TGIF.  I first ate here about ten years ago in Vegas and I remember not being terribly impressed.  And, this was at the time when I thought the ground round was formal dining.  That being the case I was sure I would be disappointed this time.  I had lunch here on Monday afternoon with a friend.  It was around 230 PM and it was on a Monday so they weren't that busy.  The space itself is very nice.  It's attached to Ross Park Mall and is very big with a large open air environment.  The booths are spacious and the place feels clean and has a lot of dark wood.  As soon as we entered we were greated with a big smile and a friendly host.  We were seated at a good booth and the server arrived promptly.  They had a fun selection of iced teas and I think I had the passion fruit iced tea, which was ""unsweetened"" but I didn't believe it needed any additional sugar.  I ordered a black bean soup that was the special.  It was about average and the consistency for me was a little too mushed.  The sour cream on top was a good amount without being overwhelming.  They had a huge menu which is always kind of scary because who can do so many things so well.  I ordered a ""navajo"" chicken sandwich.  The reason I wanted to try it is because the bun was native american fry bread.  My friend ordered a burrito.  The navajo sandwich was delicious.  The fry bread was light and airy and perfect for the sandwich, which was chicken breast and avocado mostly.  The chicken was a bit overcooked and dry.  The avocado was perfect.  I often order avocado and it's not ripe enough.  The fries were forgettable.  Lisa's burrito was as big as my head.  It was okay.  Definitely a very americanized burrito relying more on heavy sauces and cheese than distinctive ingredients.  I'm not a dessert person, but she ordered the oreo cheesecake (I think?).  It was good, but not as good as I would expect from the ""CHEESECAKE"" factory.  The service continued to be perfect.  I was really impressed with the staff here.  This place is definitely better than TG McFunsteres... But, probably still not worth a two hour wait."
