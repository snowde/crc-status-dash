Jen L.,"Boston, MA",22,74,11,3.0,9/20/2014,"This location is fine, but nothing special. As always, the cheesecake is totally delicious. We have definitely come here before just to order cheesecake to bring home.  Last night, we were able to sit outside, which was a bonus, but the service was only OK. Our app plate was never cleared throughout dinner and drinks were on the slow side. I had to ask for a second drink because our server never came around and asked. I've had better....I've had worse.  I'm a big fan of the avocado eggroll app, so when we come here that's always a given. I've you've never had it, I really recommend it! It's one of the best things on their menu and the dipping sauce is delicious. I'm hungry just thinking about them! I ordered the grilled fish tacos as my entree and they were pretty bland. There was no real flavorful sauce or even strong citrus flavor. They were fine, but I wouldn't order them again.  Overall, it's a decent place to sit outside for drinks and some cheesecake. The atmosphere is nice and it wasn't too loud."
Emma O.,"Columbus, OH",9,84,4,3.0,6/13/2013,It's okay for a chain. The menu is massive. Like lord of the rings trilogy massive as are the portions. My dishes were always decent but I always ended up spending any from 20-30 dollars.  I ran into some slight problems though when attempting to buy cheesecake for my roommate. I don't eat cheesecake and when I ask the man... hmm I mean apathetic adolescent behind the counter which cheesecake he'd recommend he seemed a little annoyed by my question and without looking at me said he didn't like cheesecake. Fine whatever. Maybe they stashed him behind that particular counter so he wouldn't be tempted to nibble away at the confections. So I deferred to the girl next to him. Apparently she didnt like cheesecake either and had no opinions on the matter. The worker behind her same situation. Thanks for all the help. In the end i made the decision with the help of another patron.
Craig G.,"State College, PA",13,5,,5.0,3/7/2016,This is our first time going to this place. It was a good experience. The service and food were excellent. The dessert was expensive but it was very good. We may have pick a better day (Monday) with less crowd and food was cooked quickly enough for our kids that most days lose their patient.
Jennifer G.,"Pittsburgh, PA",100,411,180,4.0,7/3/2013,"If you like things overdone, then the Cheesecake Factory is for you. The menu is HUGE.  The positive is that it offers tons of choices so even the pickiest eater can find something.  The downside is that it can be very difficult to choose unless you are in the mood for something in particular.  This location has a large seating area and also offers outdoor patio seating.  We went on a Thursday evening and were able to be seated right away.   Service was friendly and efficient.  She was attentive but not intrusive.    We tried the Buffalo Bites and the fried macaroni and cheese.  The Buffalo Bites were more than enough for a meal by themselves.  There were a lot of them there.  The flavor is spicy but not over the top.  One of my favorite items on the menu.  We also tried the macaroni and cheese balls.  They were tasty and although it doesn't seem like a lot (especially compared to the number of buffalo blasts) they are filling and worth ordering. Entrees were pasta and the chicken bam bam.  Both portions were HUGE and enough to serve at least two or three people.  The positive on that was leftovers for two additional meals.  Both were flavorful and we would order both of them again.   Not that either of us had the room for it, but we both ordered cheesecake.  I went for the red velvet cheesecake and my husband ordered the cherry cheesecake.  Topped with a generous dash of whipped cream, the size of the pieces was substantial (as they should be for $7 a slice).  They were tasty and stood up well to being eaten several days later as part of our leftovers. I was disappointed they discontinued the salted carmel pretzel drink, but other than that, this was a top notch visit to the Cheesecake Factory."
Maureen M.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,75,27,4.0,3/3/2016,"Brunch here is so good! The French toast is amazing- try the monte crisco! Traditional monte crisco with eggs covered in melted cheese served on French toast. Easily enough for two meals, as all their food is. I hate breakfast potatoes so they offered me a side of tomatoes instead which, for me, was perfect. I would have liked a fruit salad option but I thought the tomatoes were a unique and satisfying accompaniment. We don't come often because my husband doesn't like their dinner but I've never disliked a meal here. The chicken and garlic noodles is my favorite lunch/dinner dish. Service is always standard. The cheesecake is pricey but worth the occasional splurge!"
Ryan L.,"Coraopolis, PA",42,16,17,5.0,3/2/2016,"Was a Wednesday night, got sat within seconds. Just went for dessert. Tiramisu....  bomb."
Holly S.,"Oakdale, PA",0,25,3,4.0,9/1/2016,"My boyfriend and I went here to eat for our date night dinner. We sat outside enjoying the nice weather. Unfortunately, we sat at our table for 15mins and were never greeted by our server. My boyfriend went inside to find out who it was going to be and none of the employees even looked at him! I went in after and waited for the hostess to ask her about it. She sent out our server who explained it was a shift change, it was right before 5pm, so she didn't know they sat us. That's understandable but more organization and communication would have started our dinner off on a better foot. After that our server was efficient and attentive. The fried zucchini starter was very good but our entrees were okay (shrimp basket and chicken di pana). The cheesecake is delicious here. I really go to this establishment solely for the cheesecake."
Carrie M.,"Pittsburgh, PA",36,17,,5.0,9/22/2015,"I love love the cheesecake factory!!! There is something for everyone....no matter what you are in the mood for, they probably have it or something close"
Christopher G.,"Falls Church, VA",267,96,197,4.0,9/17/2014,It's cheesecake factory!  My team and I had a good time here. Our server was awesome. My only negative was that they took the Wasabi crusted tuna off of the menu.  My meal:  app: firecracker salmon (that red cabbage is soooo good) main (1 choice): wasabi-crusted tuna with white rice and veggies (discontinued dish) main (2nd choice): something (fish dish) not even memorable  dessert (my fav): tiramisu cheesecake (YUM!)
Bao T.,"Pittsburgh, PA",176,45,159,3.0,4/27/2013,"I've been to The Cheesecake Factory a few times now. Somehow I always end up going on the weekends and it's always so packed.  Their foods are OK. To me, the menu isn't all that great mainly because I come here just for the finale... aka the cheesecake! Lol.  However, recently I tried to Shrimp & Chicken Gumbo and omg, it's delicious! I also love the bread that they give you at the beginning. Overall it's an OK restaurant to come if you're around the SS area and/or craving cheesecake! :)"
Alex S.,"Pittsburgh, PA",186,85,172,3.0,5/29/2015,"I am not a fan of huge chain restaurants. Taco Bell? Barf. McDonalds? Bleh. Olive Garden? Ick. Panera Bread? I can make this stuff myself. Chipotle? ...Well, I actually like Chipotle, but you get the point. Essentially, what you get at chain restaurants can be hit or miss. The food might be good one day but terrible the next; one establishment might be clean and presentable while another might be deplorable; customer service--if any--might be excellent one night but completely lacking another night. Although I try to keep an open mind, having experienced this myself, I walked into The Cheesecake Factory with fairly modest expectations. I usually do not visit The Cheesecake Factory unless there is a special occasion, such as a once-in-a-year family gathering, a birthday party, or a baby shower. It just so happened that one of my colleagues was having a lunchtime baby shower and this was the venue. So, I drove from Shadyside to Southside, met a little traffic, and parked my car in one of the garages without too much trouble. I walked into the restaurant. As expected, the entrance is very large, expansive, and modernesque, almost like walking into a super high-end shopping mall or a mansion. Ahead was the host/hostess station. I introduced myself and stated that I was there for a baby shower until my colleague's name. They found her name and directed me through the labyrinth of a restaurant all the way to the back and around the corner. Okay! Let's see if I get lost... After I found my group and exchanged pleasantries, I sat down and waited a couple minutes for our waiter. I ordered a mojito and a glass of water for the time being. I received the mojito, which looked and tasted quite good, but he seemed to have misplaced or forgotten my water. I never got a chance to flag him down until he came back who knows how many minutes later to take our food orders. I ordered a pizza and salad combo while my colleagues ordered pasta, steak, salads, and sandwiches. The food took about 20 minutes to arrive, which wasn't too bad considering our group was composed of 10 or so people. I got my water (yay!) and my food. The margherita pizza I ordered was supposedly a personal size pizza and the house salad I got was drizzled with balsamic vinaigrette. Both tasted quite good, but were very large, which was the norm at The Cheesecake Factory. I ate my salad first before moving onto the pizza, of which I managed to eat two slices. During our meal, several of us wanted to get boxes for their leftovers, but our waiter was nowhere to be found. We ended up having to wait until the very end of our meal when our waiter suddenly appeared to ask how our meal was and if we would like some dessert. Some of us ordered dessert while the rest of us requested boxes. The cheesecakes that came out looked divine; alas, I didn't order any because I had eaten and drunk too much. Finally, getting each of our bills didn't take too long. We boxed our food, washed up, and left the restaurant feeling much too stuffed. Overall, the food and drinks were quite good. There was no hair or odd treasures to be found in the food, and no floaty things in our drinks. My only gripe is the outrageous portion sizes, even for lunch! One slice of cheesecake could feed a family of three or four! Only in America... Service lacked somewhat, however. The waiter could have given us a bit more attention in addition to the typical ordering, delivery, and payment collection processes. As I have stated in the beginning, I will not come to The Cheesecake Factory unless there was a special occasion. Supersize portions and flaky customer service are just not for me."
Kasey D.,"McKeesport, PA",0,2,,4.0,2/10/2016,Went for an early Valenyines date with the boyfriend Fantastic service! Best service ive had in a long time at a restaurant!  Waitress was  promt when we needed somthing but left us go to enjoy our date otherwise!  Food is always fantastic here. I got the Tostado chicken salad.. huge portions!!  Would highly recommend for a great date night!
Whitley S.,"Pittsburgh, PA",287,112,422,4.0,11/3/2012,"Food and drinks are always great! I'm a little hesitant going to chain restaurants, but this place is awesome! Every time I come here, the food is perfection! I always opt for the tomato basil pasta. I've had the meatloaf (great!), ahi(tuna) tar tare (fabulous!), Godiva cheesecake (descendant), cosmopolitan (strong!). If you and your dining guests are indecisive on where to eat... this is the place to go! Everything you can possibly think of if listed on the menu in some form.  The waiter we had this time around seemed new. He was very friendly, but needed more experience.  My only real complaint is the wait and the reservation guidelines. Basically, you have to reserve before 11am (if you're a large group), or wait in the main area for hours before getting a table after 7PM on a weekend. This is a major restaurant to go to in the Pittsburgh area apparently. If you go on a weekend, I would suggest getting there between 5:30 and 6:30 to avoid waiting forever."
Kevin B.,"Mount Juliet, TN",204,723,703,4.0,12/27/2012,"I'll start off by saying that this was my first time venturing to The Cheesecake Factory and I had heard many rumors of the unhealthiness of the food. I ordered a buffalo chicken sandwich and I figured that since I was going to take a hit between that and a slice of cheesecake, I should get a salad with balsamic vinaigrette as my side. The sandwich came out and it was the greasiest thing I have ever eaten. The bun tasted like it had been deep fried and then soaked in oil overnight - completely unnecessary. To my astonishment, my salad came out with a cream-based balsamic vinaigrette. There's just no reason to put cream in everything. That being said, the service was spectacular and my slice of coconut cheesecake was ridiculously good.  Overall - great service and cheesecake, insanely unhealthy food. Still a good place to go, but I would probably stick to dessert next time."
Barbara N.,"Vandergrift, PA",1,23,,1.0,8/7/2015,"Husband and I went here for a date night.  It was around 5 and not busy.  They took our name and said they would be right with us.  As we sat there for 10 minutes, we saw 8 different groups come in and be seated immediately.  Some the same as us, groups of two.  A group of four and a group of three too.  All got seated before us as we stood there, 10 feet away.  We could see empty tables from where we're standing.  The hostess looked at us several times and simply ignored us.  I love the Cheesecake Factory and I was looking forward to it, but never again at this location.  We went across the street to the Hofbräuhaus House and enjoyed their wonderful food for the first time (they sat us immediately).  Horrible customer service."
Ashley K.,"Las Vegas, NV",22,28,17,5.0,10/14/2015,"Last night me and hubby went to have a dinner night out. I'm yelping bc the service was fantastic. It was refreshing to have a friendly and hard working server bc we all know pittsburgh isn't known for that. Thank you Grace!!! Pens game at home so it wasn't as packed as normal. Also, the gluten free pasta options are the best. I recommend this location even if you have to wait. Ps of course we ended up leaving with a cheese cake .. red velvet!!"
Elizabeth B.,"Pittsburgh, PA",187,744,192,4.0,11/4/2012,"I remember excitedly trying The Cheesecake Factory eight years ago in Atlanta and have been enjoying this chain restaurant ever since! I work close to this location in South Side Works and really enjoy going here for lunch and cheesecake. However, I think their dinner entrees are a bit overpriced and underwhelming, and since the wait times can get long, I wouldn't personally get dinner from here. Based on lunch and dinner, I would only rate this restaurant three stars. However, I think The Cheesecake Factory deserves four stars for the environment and desserts. I've enjoyed the majority of the cheesecakes that I've tried since first going here eight years ago, including -- Oreo Dream Extreme, Ultimate Red Velvet, Godiva, White Chocolate Raspberry, Adam's Peanut Butter Cup, Craig's Crazy Carrot Cake, etc. I highly recommend dropping by The Cheesecake Factory around 9-10pm on the weekend to eat cheesecake, have coffee or a drink, and hang out with friends."
J M.,"Trenton, NJ",1,135,,4.0,7/1/2014,"I can never give Cheesecake Factory a 5-star until they change their facility design (the hellish din when they are busy is what keeps me away most of the time.)  But I spotted an opportunity to dine al-fresco here at their South Side location and took full advantage. What we found so great was that CF has implemented a ""skinnylicious menu"", and it surely is skinnylicious.  We loved our meals, they were tasty and low in calories (because low in carbs, IMO)  Hats off to you guys, I'll be visiting again whenever you're not busy or I can dine outside of your horrible echo-chamber dining rooms!"
Becky Z.,"Pittsburgh, PA",112,95,12,3.0,3/6/2012,"One does not simply walk into the Cheesecake Factory!  The reasons are twofold. First, the columns look like the eye of Sauron (see picture). Second, the wait for dinner is always at least 20 minutes. On a weekend night, expect to wait about 45 minutes to an hour.  Boy and I attempted to go to the CF on a Friday evening and were given an hour plus wait time. We decided to go to the Claddagh instead (but that's another review). We went back on Sunday evening, and it was still very crowded. We waited for about 20 minutes at the bar. My biggest peeve with the Cheesecake Factory, however, is the menu. It's as thick as a Dickens novel! In social science, they call the weariness one gets from having too many choices ""analysis paralysis."" I felt this in abundance.  Finally, I settled on a turkey burger with a side salad and my very lovely boyfriend chose the meatloaf.  We split an appetizer of nachos.  The nachos were ok, but they were quite bland despite it being topped with jalapenos. I enjoyed my turkey burger and salad, but my ever-so-handsome boyfriend didn't like his meatloaf much.  I think they snuck some mushrooms into it. I found it to be overly salty.  *Boy grew very upset and outwardly showed his displeasure at having mushrooms in his meatloaf. He hopped onto the table and screamed ""My PRECIOUS meatloaf!"" A waiter shortly stopped by to assuage the angry customer, but boy bit his finger off and took the ring he was wearing.  Using this one ring, boy was now free to move invisibly about the kitchen, removing every mushroom in sight. After he had completed this task, he destroyed the evil ring in a bubbling pot of artichoke dip.  Some eagles came and took us back to the South Side, having strangely been absent for the first two parts of our dining experience.* Oh, we also shared some Snickers cheesecake. It wasn't anything to write home about."
