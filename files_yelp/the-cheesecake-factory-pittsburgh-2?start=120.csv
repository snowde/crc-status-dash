October S.,"Pittsburgh, PA",115,562,40,4.0,12/23/2010,"Oh pumpkin pecan cheesecake, I love you. I've never had anything I didn't like and the service has always been efficient.  The menu is extensive and there is something for everybody. My 3 sisters are the pickiest eaters ever and today they cleaned their plates!  Prices are decent, the 4 of us had lunch and 3 slices of cheesecake and it was $75. It looks fancy but you can go in jeans and a t and feel comfortable"
Will H.,"Boston, MA",109,328,429,3.0,2/29/2012,"As far as chain restaurants go, Cheesecake Factory is among the better choices you'll find. Yes, the menu is ridiculously large. Yes, the wait for a table is ridiculously long, but you're typically in for a decent meal...especially when you eventually find those one or two dishes that actually resonate with your own taste buds. Of course, that's not an easy task. It's a good place to take people because they have something for every taste in their menu, but until you find some go-to choices, you could easily be disappointed, as my wife and I will tell you...it's hardly worth the hour or hour-and-a-half wait, but without the wait, it's a great place for a quick bite. Also, even when you find your favorite dish, a great meal is never guaranteed. For me, the orange chicken is excellent, but it's a 50-50 toss-up whether or not they'll get my side right. I simply ask for STEAMED carrots, as I can't stand the oily vegetables the meal usually comes with, but I'm often served exactly the side I described disliking upon ordering. Generally, the wait staff that I have is nice about it, and immediately fixes it, but it's still frustrating that they get it wrong so often. Known for their epic portions, and yummy cheesecake, neither are misleading reputations. Most meals, even in lunch portion, are so gluttonous that you'll likely be taking leftovers with you. Especially at the cost, you're not going to want to just waste your meal. Aside from the few issues that I've mentioned, I've had way more positive meals and experiences at Cheesecake Factory than not. They do a surprisingly good job with almost every dish, and considering the numerous cooking styles the chefs are responsible for preparing, that's an impressive feat. It's generally a safe bet for a decent meal. Not to mention, I do like quite a few of their appetizers. The ahi carpaccio, although a little heavy on the sauces, is really good, as are the factory nachos and avocado eggrolls. My other favorite thing is the unsweetened iced green tea. I can drink that all day.  Regardless, you're probably only there for dessert anyway, and that's the one area that I've never been disappointed in. Best cheesecake ever? I wouldn't go anywhere near that far, but it's as rich and fulfilling as you'd expect, and should please the majority."
Dave S.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,4,,4.0,10/28/2015,One of my favorite places too take the kids when there home from college or during the holidays good food and great cheesecake though seems rather hard too navigate through sometimes.very professional waitress thanks again will be back .Dave s
Deepali S.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,3,,4.0,7/22/2015,"I love this place. Everything about this place is good.. Ambience, food, people. We are vegetarians and this place has good options for us. We had avocado egg rolls, Ligurian pesto pasta, spicy chipotle pasta. I am going again and again not just for the items listed in menu but also for the fresh baked bread with butter."
Glenn C.,"Cincinnati, OH",887,887,858,4.0,2/9/2012,"I'm a fan of Cheesecake Factory because it is consistent with other Cheesecake Factories.  Menu, bread, drinks are exactly the same.  The portions are large and the food is always good.  Pricing is decent.  They have curbside service which is nice for carryout (at this location).    I read some of the other reviews and just like other popular restaurants especially cheesecake factory, you are going to have waits and sometimes you will have bad service.   This was my first time at this location. I have been to Cheesecake Factories from DC to LA.  Service was initially slow considering it wasn't that crowded, but my food came quickly.   They also validate 2 hours of parking."
Becca S.,"Danville, PA",0,15,,5.0,4/29/2016,Great place for any meal! In the great town of Pittsburg PA. They have something for everyone! Always great service and atmosphere!  The cheesecake and all desserts are to die for!!! Love love love this place! So do my kids. Also kid friendly!
Aileen E.,"Pittsburgh, PA",7,19,,5.0,8/6/2015,"I love cheesecake and have probably eaten here 50+ times. People are intimidated by their huge menu, but you can really just close your eyes, flip through the pages, and pick a dish. Everything is good here. My go to dishes are : factory nachos, avocado eggrolls, stuffed chicken tortillas (corn cakes are amazing!), Louisiana chicken pasta, and thai chicken lettuce wraps. I don't think I've ever finished my entree because the portions are enormous. The cheesecakes are obviously amazing. Favorites include: godiva cheesecake, pineapple upside cheesecake, apple strudel, and smores. Again, you can't go wrong!"
Amanda H.,"Myrtle Beach, SC",62,1,,2.0,8/3/2015,"This is the second time within 2 weeks that I have visited the South side location. Last week our service was poor and we made a point to let someone know. Giving them another chance, we are back today for lunch. Service is still just as bad. It took 10 minutes for us to get water, and even longer for bread after she said she would bring some, we still had to ask after 15 minutes had passed"
Faith A.,"Boston, MA",214,546,189,3.0,3/1/2012,"I like the Cheesecake Factory for a multitude of reasons.  It is right outside of my window pretty much, no matter what I am in the mood for, they have something that can meet my hunger needs, and the service overall is great.   I have tried numerous things here and have seldom been disappointed.  From  their mixed drinks (Yum on the Strawberry Martini)  to their apps (my personal faves are the sweet corn tamale cakes and the factory nachos now- thanks to my husband for the love of the nachos), and their huge variety of well, EVERYTHING.   The only problems with this place are when you have such a variety, you may do a lot of things well, but not great... and this is the case here.  Although I have never had an awful experience, I have never been completely wowed.  The wait is always bad too.   I just think if I am going to have to wait that long, there are probably a lot of better places I can go to."
Ro H.,"Cherry Hill, NJ",3,24,40,5.0,9/27/2014,"Came for dessert for a birthday. The cheesecake is of course, awesome. Portion s are HUGE. We split the cookie dough cheese cake a la mode. The ice cream is so good...the menu says its exclusively made for the Cheesecake Factory by Edys: YUM. It was all so good and one slice is definitely enough for two!  We sat on the outside patio and it was beautiful. Service was great and we were seated right away on a Saturday night at 10pm.  They even pre-split the cheesecake for us since they knew we were sharing, and my friends was decorated for her birthday with a candle and sprinkles! Nice touch, Cheesecake Factory."
Hayley B.,"Pittsburgh, PA",532,21,14,3.0,9/5/2014,"Went here last night with my family. I've never had issues with this restaurant before and again I didn't. The food is never too die for but you get big portions and the staff is usually very friendly and attentive.  The 5 of us split two apps.. Chicken and mushroom lettuce wraps and avocado egg rolls. Both pretty tasty and it was a good amount to share between us and leave room for dinner.  We all liked our meals too, my aunt was disappointed in the white chicken chili bc they said it wasn't spicy and it was and they also said it came with a side of rice. Well the rice was about a tablespoon on her soup. So that was far from truthful.  Normally I like to try places that aren't chain restaurants, so when I read the menu here, which is almost TOO big, I sometimes get disappointed because it's almost like they try too hard to make different dishes. Hard to explain but I'm sure a lot of you feel the same.  Once again, I didn't leave room for dessert. I do however recommend their red velvet cheesecake from the last time I was there.  I also recommend the Cajun chicken littles and Cajun pasta with chicken asparagus peas and peppers."
Oren S.,"Pittsburgh, PA",6,125,,5.0,2/20/2015,"First, the downsides, and there are not many: the crowds and the wait: no reservations, no phone-ahead seating, no No-Wait app.  Be prepared to wait for a long time on a weekend night.  I understand the wait can be two hours, a lengthy of time I would never wait for a table anywhere.  My wife and I planned an early dinner, able to be seated within ten minutes of our Friday 6:00 p. m. arrival. By the time we left at a quarter to eight, the place was mobbed despite the bitter cold weather.  Some of the tables for two are very close to each other.  Hold out for a table or booth in the main room which looks out onto the street and which offers a view. The restaurant is attractive, distinctive, and comfortable.  The seating in the main room is marvelous, nicely spaced. The bill can escalate quickly, but if one is going to spend $100 on a grand night out, this is the place to do it.  The banquet my wife and I enjoyed included: a draft Samuel Adams seasonal brew, a glass of house wine, a large kale and quinoa salad, a delicious, good-sized appetizer consisting of zucchini fries, portobello mushrooms, and avocado, a large fish sandwich with cole slaw and onion rings, and a great burger with mushrooms, cheeses, and onions on a fresh sesame seed bun, one slice of cheesecake with strawberries, one slice of tiramisu cheesecake, and two types of bread (our favorite is the dark, seeded variety).  I know of no restaurant with as many choices of perfectly prepared foods than The Cheesecake Factory.  If you have difficulty deciding what to order, you will be confounded by page after page of the extensive menu. Teamwork service ensures that the diner is well taken care of and our primary server, Grace, was sweet, friendly, attentive, and delightful. Our trip to the restaurant was longer than a half hour and it was worth going out of the way to enjoy.  Bravo!"
Carly K.,"Shadyside, Pittsburgh, PA",62,211,2,4.0,12/1/2013,"I like this location, and find it to be an easy place to grab lunch if im  shopping at South Side Works during the mid afternoon on the weekend. I tend to come here at about 2 or 3pm on a weekend day. I won't waste my time by coming when it's crowded and waiting for an hour. At that point it's just not worth it. I love the guacamole that they will prepare to taste, depending on how spicy you like it. I also enjoy the lunch salads, which are always huge. The only difference I have found between the lunch and dinner salads is the meat portion. Otherwise, they are exactly the same size. As far as entrées go, I enjoy the Crusted Chicken Romano, the Pasta da Vinci, and the Miso and Herb Crusted Salmon. The Luau and Barbeque Chicken Salads are go to items for me as well. To finish, if I'm not overly stuffed, I love the strawberry shortcake. It's loaded with strawberries and is perfect for sharing. I also really enjoy the Coconut Cream, Banana Cream, and Pina Colada cheesecakes. If you are a chocolate person, I would recommend the Godiva or Chocolate Mousse Cheesecakes. As far as chains go, CF is a dependable choice. There is something for everyone, so it's great for a large group, especially when picky eaters are involved. I mean, who doesn't love cheesecake?"
Anne C.,"New York, NY",209,280,40,2.0,7/1/2013,"I feel a little silly rating this chain but here's my justification: For some reason, I don't know why, but the Cheesecake Factory in King of Prussia was amazing, and I expected the same when I went to the one in South Side. I was horribly disappointed. Not only was the atmosphere a little different, the food wasn't as good as I had remembered.  I'm willing to pay a pretty penny for a nice meal but this was way overpriced for what they were serving you. The portion sizes at South Side weren't as generous either.  This place is a quintessential American restaurant so don't expect anything ""exotic"" or unique. You can pretty much get their food at a diner for half the cost. There is one redeeming quality for the Cheesecake Factory - the cheesecake. Everything else on the menu you can skip, but if you want to lull yourself in a sugar coma the cheesecake here is your calling. While it is still overpriced for their cheesecake, splurging every once in a while didn't kill me."
Wesley S.,"Moon, PA",26,8,4,5.0,1/8/2015,"Jonathen was our bartender. He was awesome! Quick service, good drinks, and an overall very nice personality. Plus he's a hottie! He did pressure me into getting adams peanut butter cheesecake, which was an overall great choice... Lol"
Funtime P.,"Pittsburgh, PA",42,307,1031,5.0,6/21/2011,"I don't understand why people are complaining that they are getting lots of good food that tastes good? Are you nuts? This is one of my favorite places to eat. The food is always delicious, I love cheesecake and have never had a bad piece and have tried like 10 kinds. The snickers bar and chocolate coconut are two of my favorites. I love the sweet corn tamale cakes appetizer!!!! The atmosphere is trendy and unique and there are lots of hot people there. I LOVE GETTING TONS OF FOOD WITH MY MEAL KEEP SERVING HUGE PORTIONS PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!! My biggest complaint is that they gave me lots of food on my plate and it tastes good, WHAT'S WRONG WITH THIS PLACE!!!!!"
Tiffany K.,"Kyle, TX",39,24,2,4.0,9/14/2013,"If you enjoy Cheesecake Factory food & ambiance, this is a good one. Popular Friday night spot in a fun area of town, folks were dressed in their good-doin' clothes - maybe it was the day of the week, but it felt more upscale than most CF's.  The lemon-dill salmon was amazing & I'm sure I could eat a big bowl of their mashed pots. Cheesecake (white chocolate raspberry truffle, this time) was amazing.  Exceptional service at a place that generally does food & service well; overall great experience."
Ann P.,"Pittsburgh, PA",1,3,,1.0,2/16/2015,A half hour wait for a sandwich to be served. No warning. No attention. The excuse: this chain's kitchen is unable to serve individual customers and a large party simultaneously. So why are they in the restaurant business?
Kristin B.,"Pittsburgh, PA",236,802,7220,4.0,5/30/2010,"I was ready to realllly not like this place...and, you know what, I liked it!  A lot.  Food was tasty and inexpensive, the scenery was gorgeous, and the service was just about spot-on.  I'd never been to a Cheesecake Factory restaurant before yesterday and certainly had no complaints about this one. This restaurant, in SouthSide Works' beautiful Town Square, couldn't have scored a better location.  I doubt they're ever hurting for business!  Your parking garage or valet ticket, by the way, can be validated here. My opinion is that The Cheesecake Factory is a place for burgers and sandwiches and salads and the obvious--cheesecake!  That being said, we stuck to inexpensive menu items and were very happy with our food.  I just don't see ""The Cheesecake Factory"" as a place where I'm merrily going to drop over $20 for a lunch or dinner entree.  That's silly to me; there are numerous delicious nearby places where one can enjoy a more lavish meal.  My mother, brother, and my brother's fiancee all seemed to love their yummy-looking food, but my boyfriend's ""Sonoma Burger"" (from the ""Glamburgers"" section of the restaurant's massive menu) was particularly delicious.  Super-juicy, maybe a bit too greasy, and topped with thin red onions, oven-roasted tomatoes, mushrooms, arugula, herbed goat cheese, and mayo.  I haven't had a burger in years, but this one made me reconsider my burger-eating frequency.  I also loved my ""Factory Chopped Salad,"" loaded with ingredients.  My only issue--and shame on the chef!--was that the bitter hard avocado used was days away from being ripe, yuck.   Our server John was kind, helpful, and attentive.  Nice guy. You know, it does bother me that--and it's no secret--The Cheesecake Factory generally serves super-unhealthy dishes.    is my computer home page, and each time a ""Top 10 Unhealthy Restaurant ____"" article is featured, Cheesecake Factory menu items are all over the list.  Sort of bums me out, but then again the place IS called ""The Cheesecake Factory,"" which doesn't particularly conjure thoughts of healthful eating. When dessert time rolled around yesterday we were stuffed and, thank goodness, avoided the featured red velvet cheesecake and its alternating layers of cheesecake and red velvet cake and cream cheese frosting glory.  It was very tempting though, as were basically all of the rich decadent cheesecakes this place has to offer. A perfectly pleasant lunch experience in pretty SouthSide Works!"
Amy V.,"Toronto, Canada",3,23,12,4.0,11/17/2014,"Food: The lunch special really surprised us. The portion was enormous. We ordered the Barbeque Ranch Chicken Salad and Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta.  Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta: The pasta was kinda sweet yet spicy at the same time. We really enjoy it.  Barbeque Ranch Chicken Salad: I kinda like the fried onion strings on top. It was very crispy and crunchy. However, there was too much dressing on the salad.   The only thing amazing about this place is their Ultimate Red Velvet Cake Cheesecake!! We are in love with it! Atmosphere and Service: Long wait time and the service was really slow. The indoor design is nice, but the outdoor building design looks much more amazing. Overall: Definitely recommend everyone to come try out their cheesecakes!"
