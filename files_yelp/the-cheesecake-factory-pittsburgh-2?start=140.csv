Alan O.,"Pittsburgh, PA",9,28,21,4.0,2/17/2013,I'm not a huge fan of going to dinner there based on how busy they are. I do though love calling for curbside pickup. On nights that's its snowing and cold out its fun to just pull up and not have to get out if your car.
Kayli K.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,7,,1.0,12/3/2014,Tasted like they heated up a frozen dinner for us. soggy.
Rebecca D.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,5,,1.0,12/1/2015,"Okay okay, here's the deal. I remember eating here, but I don't remember what anything tasted like. That's how irrelevant the food here is. I would rather face all of my insecurities than eat at this cheesecake factory EVER AGAIN. The Cheesecake Factory aesthetic is comfortable and fun, unlike Pancy, our waitress. She was no fun and did not get us extra brown bread when we asked for it. Maybe she was having a bad day, but SO WAS I! Anyways, definitely not worth the prices, but if you want to look cool on a date or business meeting. . .you should go here.  I had a subpar experience at The Cheesecake Factory."
Emily D.,"Pittsburgh, PA",34,108,19,4.0,9/24/2014,"I always love The Cheesecake Factory especially the one down in the South Side. Their food is amazing and their cheesecake is incredible, obviously that's why they are called the cheesecake factory! It's so pretty outside and inside! I love how the lighting is dimmed. The servers are nice as well. My favorite cheesecake is the cookie dough cheesecake, and I get that every time I go there!"
Alex B.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,5,,1.0,10/31/2014,"Totally dissapointed. After hearing everyone e ant on and on about the cheesecake factory, i decided to try it out with my girlfriend. She got the fish tacos and i got the hamburger and fries. Both dishes were very dry and tasteless. But that is what you can expect with pre made food kept in the freezer. Then we decided to try the cheesecake. After all, its in the name. The cake was totally frozen and the truffle was like a rock. They hould atleast take the time to make decent cheesecake. I wouldnt mind the wait. Overall, i will not be returning."
Laura W.,"Washington, DC",247,1150,1737,3.0,7/31/2014,"My ex worked at the cheesecake factory years ago and he-being a cook-was able to bring home a free menu item (or cheesecake) every night he worked. My favorite things for him to bring home were: the spicy chipotle chicken pasta,the Louisiana chicken pasta,the chicken madeira, and the godiva chocolate cheesecake. The spicy chipotle chicken pasta is honey Glazed Chicken, Asparagus, Red and Yellow Peppers, Peas, Garlic and Onion in a Spicy Chipotle Parmesan Cream Sauce(this is what my mother always orders when dining here). The Louisiana chicken pasta is Parmesan Crusted Chicken Served Over Pasta with Mushrooms, Peppers and Onions in a Spicy New Orleans Sauce. The chicken madeira is Sautéed Chicken Breast Topped with Fresh Asparagus and Melted Mozzarella Cheese. Covered with Fresh Mushroom Madeira Sauce and Served with Mashed Potatoes. The godiva cheesecake is Layers of Flourless Godiva Chocolate Cake, Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake and Chocolate Mousse. It also comes with a godiva square. It always crowded and honestly there are better restaurants to eat at in the south side then this chain but it sure was nice being able to eat this food for free regularly!"
Shawn N.,"Canonsburg, PA",0,29,10,4.0,8/23/2014,It's pretty good. I'm pretty sure it is a knock-off of The Cheesecake Warehouse in the Seattle area.
Tessa M.,"Los Angeles, CA",382,345,8,4.0,1/20/2013,"i'm a fan of the cheesecake factory in general. i always hear that the quality of food is just not worth the price, etc. i've had amazing and iffy dishes here, but overall, i think the price is pretty reasonable for the amount of food you get and i'd say the majority of the dishes i've tried here i've liked. oh and, if you've never had it, you HAVE TO try the cheesecake. every flavor i've had, i've loved. now, about this location specifically. parking is kind of a pain unless you're ok with parking in the garage. this location is pretty big but always busy, so be prepared to wait at least a few minutes. but i've always had good servers here. knowledgeable, nice, and a sense of humor. i'd recommend this location, especially for your first cheesecake factory experience."
R L.,"Pittsburgh, PA",16,43,34,4.0,8/5/2014,"I wanted to take advantage of half price cheesecakes day and enjoyed a dine-in meal.  After thumbing through the book of a menu, I decided to save room for the cheesecake and ordered the small sizes chicken sliders and zucchini fries along with happy hour Mojito (my favorite mixed drink)! Even their small portions are sufficient! After eating that meal, I was so stuffed that I didn't eat my cheesecake until the next day! Whew, their food is fresh and awesome! The cheesecake was delicious btw and well priced! If you have a big appetite, you will enjoy their variety, fresh food and cheesecakes!"
Adam C.,"Pittsburgh, PA",219,146,12,1.0,1/14/2014,"I try to review chains on their individual merits. How good is this version in relation to the other clones elsewhere? For TCF, however, they seem to be universally deplorable. It's criminally unhealthy, has the most gigantic and depressing menu I've ever seen in my life, and is, as culinary experiences go, utterly lamentable. I would rather go anywhere else."
Kathlene B.,"Philadelphia, PA",3,47,3,3.0,1/16/2012,"Food- Same as any other Cheesecake Factory.  My issue with this particular location is that they have a number of a-holes working there.  They walk by and make snide comments while you are eating.  I was there once at closing- the waitress (who was great) was a little slow with the check and I was admittedly slow giving it back, so by the time I got it back, they were officially closed.    I sat to calculate the tip and two guys come by to clean the table next to mine and remark loudly ""Man, where did the music go? Oh that's right, we're CLOSED!"" That whole thing was completely unnecessary, and the worst is that the manager was there and said nothing.  I've worked in food service and retail, so I get it, but I have never shopped anywhere, eaten anywhere, or worked anywhere where people acted like that.   I complained to the manager about it today and he was very much apologetic, which I appreciated-hence the three stars instead of two."
Michelle B.,"Bethel Park, PA",40,26,1,5.0,6/21/2014,"I love coming here. Not only is it a beautiful and clean restaurant, but you get so much delicious food for your money. And obviously their cheesecake is amazing!!! I don't think I've ever had a bad meal or bad service here. Just make sure to get there early or there will be a line!"
MaryAlice R.,"Pittsburgh, PA",49,119,49,3.0,3/17/2014,"Always crowded on the weekend and of course that's when they do not take reservations. Much better for lunch because it's a better price and the portion is closer to what I would like. Every time I go I share the barbecue ranch chicken salad with my friend because it's delicious(even during lunch time we can't finish it). Too expensive, too much food, and too long of a wait."
D B.,"Monroeville, PA",0,26,,2.0,9/14/2015,This place is overpriced and overcrowded.Our food was wrong twice and when we got it was lukewarm. The server complained that it wasn't his fault it was the fault of the spanish people working in the back who couldn't speak english (horrible thing to say). Truly  a terrible experience and have had similiar experiences dealing with terrible service at various other cheesecake factories. Will not be going back.
Katy R.,"San Francisco, CA",218,43,163,5.0,2/2/2014,"Your classic Cheesecake Factory.  All of the food items I've ever had here were good, exactly what you'd expect from the Cheesecake Factory.  I love the location in Southside Works, close to shopping and other nightlife.  The service has always been great here too.  Overall, a good experience and I'll definitely be back."
Barbara D.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,23,7,4.0,5/10/2013,"THE NAME SAYS IT ALL~!! I love, love, did I mention LOVE cheesecake!!  Oh, and don't they got a large selection of them.  Yes, it's over ten dollars for one slice.  Still that slice is so decadent and rich!! It's worth every penny!! Then onto the food, I think the menu is a BOOK!  Their main characters in this novel of a menu is GREAT FOOD.  I got me the twisted salted pretzel spiked milkshake, drizzled with caramel.  These meals are not everyday meals, but special occasions.  This place is well worth the money!!  Then I got chicken taco's, and the hubby got some yummy mexican dish with those delectable black beans.   Other times I've tried the portabella sandwich, that proved to be so tasty that I think I got it twice from there.  Cheesecake factory isn't just a restaurant, it's a experience.  There ambiance is superb, relaxing and just beautiful architecture.  This place has a upscale feel, in a laid back vibe.  I just LOVE IT~!!  Since this place is popular, and we have only a few scattered over Pittsburgh, there may be a wait time.  Especially on weekends.  Trust me, it's worth it!"
Big J.,"Pittsburgh, PA",49,388,268,4.0,7/25/2012,"In my opnion, this place is one of the nicest and fanciest chain restaurants in all of the land.  Yes, their prices may be high, and I absolutely agree with Joe that the nutrition of their items are outrageous, but where you want to go somewhere to splurge, this is a pretty good place to do it.   The menu is almost overwhelming, and they keep adding more and more items to it.  Actually they did recently just come out with a skinnylicious menu, so that might answer some negative complaints about their portions and nutrition.  By the way, did we even talk about the cheesecake?  Yes, it is amazing, and yes, they do have an assortment that will keep you wondering which one you want to choose."
Mischelle H.,"Cyclone, PA",3,1,,4.0,8/6/2014,My first cheesecake factory experience. It's beautiful design and friendly staff added to the delicious meal and incredible cheesecake. The staff was on the ball. We had an enjoyable time. Couldn't eat all the cheesecake... great treat later!
James W.,"Pittsburgh, PA",5,1,,5.0,8/3/2014,My Girlfriend and I went for just dessert and we were greeted promptly and waited on in under five minutes the food was perfect I will be back again and again and the parking garage was free up to 3 hours. That also made the experience more pleasant.
Caitlin C.,"Pittsburgh, PA",354,53,110,2.0,8/12/2011,"The South Side Cheesecake Factory is far worse than others. If you've ever been to Cheesecake Factory before, then you know what to expect:  a novel-sized menu, portions that could feed 3-4 people, and enough calories for one sitting, that most starving Haitians don't consume in a month.   That being said - my boyfriend and I know exactly what to expect; therefore, when we dine there, we try to cater to our own unique eating habits.  My boyfriend and I always go with the intention of splitting appetizers, because that's enough food in itself to satiate us.  We ordered the Thai Lettuce Wraps (which comes on a PLATTER - meaning its ENORMOUS), the Chicken Pot Sticker Dumplings, and Stuffed Mushrooms (from the ""small snacks"" menu, but even it being a ""small snack"" there were still 9 stuffed mushrooms).   Now I normally don't like to give a bad review of the place, based solely on the performance of the server.  I was once a server myself, for a good 12 years, and I know they are human, they have a butt load of sidework, and sometimes find themselves in the ""weeds"" when the crowd all rushes in at once.  I understand all of this and try not to let it effect the rest of my dining experience when we dine on a night like this.  However, when a server - or MULTIPLE servers on different occasions, are consistently rude and inattentive because we choose to ONLY order appetizers, is unacceptable.  And we have only experienced this attitude at the South Side location.  The moment we said we were ""just ordering a few appetizers"", her body language and facial expression could have spelled out a symphony of harmonious disappointment and irritation.  Little did she know how low-maintenance/high-tippers we normally are.  I ordered decaf coffee and a water, my boyfriend ordered a hot tea and a water - but never once, not even after she brought our appetizers, did we ever see a glass of water.  I guess decaf coffee is supposed to be a delicate complement to Chicken Pot Stickers.    Plus - THE RACKET!!!!  All of the servers and the bussers are extremely clumsy with taking away dishes, and re-setting tables.  I think we heard about 5 dishes crack the 45 minutes we were there. The entire night, my boyfriend and I had to keep asking each other to repeat ourselves, because of all the dishes and utensils clanking every single second we sat there.  Basically, in restaurant talk - the FOH might as well have not existed because it was as loud as the BOH or HOH (the kitchen for normal speaking folk).   I know this is a corporate juggernaut, and I do know what I should expect upon going in one.  This place is definitely sub-par of it's corporate standards.  I'll stick with McKnight Rd if we ever venture for quick apps again."
