Terry A.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,6,,2.0,7/21/2014,"I was so looking forward to going to the Cheesecake Factory because we do not have one anywhere close to Albuquerque, NM.  I did not go to this particular location on 27th, but did go to the one in Ross Park Mall.  What a MAJOR disappointment.  The food was WAY TO expensive, not tasty at all, and the service was the slowest I have ever experienced.  2 1/2 hrs. in a restaurant to eat a burger and piece of cheesecake is ridiculous.  Also, I did not think the cheesecake was all that great for $8 a slice. PLEASE DO NOT COME TO ALBUQUERQUE."
Joanna H.,"New York, NY",196,223,266,5.0,3/19/2012,"I went here for Friday dinner and the day after for Saturday lunch. This is how much I LOVE this place. The Cheesecake Factory has such a huge list on the menu, I feel like I could go here for a month and still not get the same food. The atmosphere is great for families, friends, dates  and just anyone! And also as a bread addict, I cannot skip mentioning about their wheat and sourdough bread. This place truly has the best bread.  Getting their organic coffee after a HUGE meal w their decadent Kahlua cheesecake is another great part too. I don't think any entree has disappointed me here. It's definitely my favorite franchise family restaurant. MUST GO!"
Cora L.,"Creighton, PA",10,39,22,4.0,10/31/2014,"Great place for dates!!!! If your looking not too expensive, not to formal but delicious!!! This is the place. I love the cheesecake factory it was one of the very first ""nice"" restaurants i had been too. Well what I thought was nice at the time. The decor inside is great, nice clean tables with linens, yes that right linens! the MENU is EXTENSIVE. They have everything from Asian to American and all in between. The food is really good but not up-scale quality. Always nice plating presentation. I got the chicken pesto pasta dish (wish I could remember its name) none the less delicious. The cheesecake menu is elaborate and they always update the menu with specials added. The bill leaving with cheesecake dinner and app with complimentary bread was around 40.00, YES i said 40.00 for 2. Such a great date night dinner paired with a movie its sure to impress any ordinary lady. A little more about the interior is huge high ceilings with pillars and faux painting to make the insides look like old Tuscan themed buildings. the lighting is a blend between modern and fresco period and lights a set to dim. Each table has its own real lit candles. This is a great place for groups and family dinners birthdays etc. I usually don't fall into the trap of what I like to call COOKIE CUTTER restaurants but if I had to choose between the factory and any other place Ive ever went its in top 3! Plus there is so much on the menu to choose from your bound to satisfy any palette."
Brad F.,"Pittsburgh, PA",12,19,16,4.0,7/6/2012,"Our appetizer was the firecracker salmon and it was AMAZING. They taste and texture... And even the cabbage it came in was good! No complaints on that! I was feeling a salad so i got the Carlton salad and it was pretty damn good. The tangerines on it were super juicy and tasty and there was no issue with the greens. The only problem was there was barely any chicken on it! For a 12.00 salad i expected a little bit more. But all in all was satisfied. The cheesecake, ohhh the cheesecake. I got the red velvet cake cheesecake and it was to die for. Thw cake part was super moist and the rest was rich and creamy. I refused to waste one bite! Our server was great, had a good sense of humor and was very attentitive.  We went at like 12:30 so there was no wait and everything came out fast."
Jason S.,"Cleveland, OH",50,297,33,2.0,3/28/2013,"Its Cheesecake Factory....been to one, you've been to them all."
Marie M.,"Scottsdale, AZ",278,143,120,4.0,1/17/2014,"Brenda took great care of us.  The menu is daunting but get yourself a glass of wine and a grilled artichoke and peruse until you hit your target.  Even after several years of high traffic, the place is still clean and well maintained."
Linda W.,"Pittsburgh, PA",186,194,340,2.0,7/23/2011,"My, oh my, oh my. What has happened to the Cheesecake Factory? Not that it was anything really special before, but it was at least always dependable. Good fresh HUGE salads and great cheesecake. Well, the salads are still huge, but that's about all I can say for the them. And the cheesecake? I wouldn't know. Suddenly, the flourless Godiva chocolate cheesecake is no longer gluten-free. What happened???!!!  I ordered the Santa Fe salad, which I've had before and enjoyed, and got something not even resembling what used to be. The chicken is either chicken lunchmeat or they now shaaaave it so thin it can't be found OR tasted. The cheese was skimpy, the corn was almost nonexistent....there was LOTS of lettuce...oh, and one tomato quarter. Why bother?  One of my dining companions ordered the Cobb salad. She had the same experience with skimpiness of ingredients. Where was the bleu cheese? She could barely identify any bacon pieces. There were TONS of hardboiled egg crumbles surrounding the plate, but nothing much else that should have been there....again, LOTS of lettuce. Oh, and the dressing was not discernible at all. After asking about the bleu cheese and dressing, the water brought over a small bowl of extra (?) bleu cheese and a small pitcher of dressing.  The restaurant was not crowded at all, the service was slow and spotty. All in all, the three of us wouldn't bother going back again. No loss.  Not only that, we each had to pay $5 to park????  And there's nothing at Southside Works anymore anyway."
Arthur F.,"Corry, PA",0,4,,5.0,2/20/2015,"It has been a long time since my wife and I visited a Cheesecake Factory. Our experience today was the same as we have always come to expect. Great food, excellent cheesecake, and superior service. Can't wait to visit again when we are in the area. We even got a bottle of wine we didn't finish packaged to go."
Kerri M.,"Johnstown, PA",3,146,,5.0,1/26/2015,"This was our first time to a Cheesecake Factory.  We could understand why it is a favorite among many.  We parked on the street a couple of blocks from the restaurant.  It is $1/hour on the street.  I'm not sure how much it is in the parking garage.  We went on a January Saturday afternoon at about 1:00 PM, we were seated right away. Our waitress was attentive.  The selection of food available is incredible and the portions are generous.  I had the dynamite shrimp, lunch herb crusted salmon and the mango key lime cheesecake.  Hubby had the wings and the mushroom burger with a side salad.  We loved our food.  The dynamite shrimp was deep fried and the sauce came on the side.  I'm not sure what the dinner portion would have been for the herb crusted salmon but the lunch portion was pretty big already.  It came with about five skinny asparagus and mashed potatoes.  The cheesecake....YUM!  It was really good.  Based on the quality of the food and the selection, I would recommend The Cheesecake Factory."
Shawn R.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,49,1,3.0,2/8/2015,"First if you haven't been here prepare yourself mentally. It's huge! And has some very obnoxious people come to eat here, this is not the place for a date or a night out with a good friend or two. You can barely hear yourself at times from the echoes of others talking. Food is good - prices are fair but cheesecake is nothing to brag about. I've had better from my local grocer. On the other hand the place is not too shabby for a group night out but they don't take reservations."
Matt S.,"Oakdale, PA",12,77,31,4.0,4/16/2013,The Cheesecake Factory is one of the better chains in the area. The pricing is expensive but the food is worth it. Very tasty food and big enough portions that you will be able to get another meal out of the leftovers.
Ingrid P.,"Pittsburgh, PA",24,105,16,2.0,8/3/2014,"My visit at the Cheesecake Factory was not for the obvious reasons. For National Cheesecake Day, the Cheesecake Factory was offering half-off a slice of cheesecake which was the only reason I went. There was a line to get to the hostess but she did a great job keeping everything in order. I only had to wait thirty minutes to get seated. Our waiter was very personable and knew about the new cheesecake flavor that came out that day. I was pleasantly surprised that we got complimentary bread. Of the two options, I liked the wheat better than the white. For my cheesecake, I chose the fresh strawberry cheesecake. It was not bad nor awesome. The cream part of the cheesecake was smooth but did not have the flavor of cream cheese. The graham cracker crust did not hold up well. I did not know that the fresh strawberry cheesecake cost slightly more than the other more elaborate cheesecake so I was slightly shocked when my bill came. The mediocre cheesecake did not make me want to come back here anytime soon."
Meredith A.,"Newcastle, United Kingdom",222,1173,3,3.0,12/13/2010,"My first time in a Cheesecake Factory was last week, when we had our office holiday lunch there.  I was struck by how...well....HUGE the place was.  I felt like I was in Honey I Shrunk the Kids, if that movie took place in some kind of pseudo-Tuscan sculpture garden.  Seriously, the building is enormous, the ceilings are waaaaay up there, and the food....I felt dwarfed by that as well. Our servers were super friendly, especially considering how challenging it can be to serve a party of twelve.  Everything came out quickly - surprisingly quickly - almost as if they predicted what we were going to order and had it waiting for us.  I'm assuming that isn't the case, and that all the food is just organized in such a way that any dish can be assembled in about 5 minutes. I had some bites of various appetizers, including the Fried Calimari, the Hot Spinach and Cheese Dip, and the Warm Crab and Artichoke Dip (which is technically a ""small plate,"" not an appetizer).  I just realized how humorous it is that one of the dips is described as Hot, and the other as Warm.  They both tasted hot to me!  All the apps were okay - the dips were gooey (in a good way), the calimari was crispy.  Everything was a bit on the salty side, not surprisingly for a chain restaurant, but not unpleasantly so.  The Spinach dip was a little runny for my taste, but it tasted good! For my entree, I got the Cuban sandwich.  It had all the classic ingredients: pork, ham, Swiss cheese, mustard, pickles.  It also had mayo on it, which I didn't really care for - I know they do that in some restaurants, but I don't really think of it as traditional. And they were pretty heavy-handed with it.  Other than that the sandwich was all right - again, pretty darn salty.  My boyfriend ate the other half later and he really enjoyed it.  I think in retrospect, I should've gone with a different choice. For dessert, I had the Snickers cheesecake.  A good size slice, served unnecessarily with two huge scoops of whipped cream (seriously, what?  who needs all that?)  I really liked the cheesecake, but ended up taking half of it home, along with some of my coworker's pumpkin cheesecake which was also delicious. the prices are affordable, the service is uber friendly, the cheesecake is tasty, and the food is pretty reliable.  I'm not big into chains so I don't think I'd be keen to return, especially since they do have a heavy hand with salt, and because the food here is, well, massively unhealthy.  I found the nutrition facts on another website and, well, it scared me.  I can see why some people would really like this place, since they have a huge variety of things and big portions. Nothing really wowed me, but it was a fine place to have a company lunch!"
Keith H.,"West Des Moines, IA",29,52,,1.0,8/20/2013,"EDIT: I am lowering the score from 2* to 1* because while it's forgivable that the FOH staff spilled something on me and my party's clothing, it isn't okay that they simply don't bother to fix that problem going forward. The manager gave us two business cards after being splashed with buffalo sauce and said that if we mailed the receipts for dry cleaning with those cards it would be reimbursed. We sent in two receipts (my fiance and I) with bills totaling $22 but after 2 months have received nothing back. I have worked as a waiter for years and I get these things happen but it is incumbent on the management staff to resolve these issues and I think the poor job they did trying to fix the situation is indefensible.  Meh! This place is just silly and expensive for the quality.  Quick thing about the restaurant: Why make waiters wear all white? EVERY server's uniform has visible stains. I have waited tables for years so I get how this happens all the time when you are bussing plates so have the waiters wear darker colors (or enforce uniform standards, there is no way all the waiters came in with clean clothes given the universal level of dirtiness). Also, a waiter dropped a thing of buffalo sauce on the floor near us which exploded on both me and one of the people I was with's white shirts, the restaurant offered to pay for dry cleaning, but I kinda think that there should be a comped desert or something as well. The dry cleaning (if effective) is an inconvenience for me which gets me back to where I was before I came in, I think that offering a dessert is something to make up for the inconvenience of making me and my dinner guest have to go to get our clothes dry cleaned. Perhaps I expect too much. About the actual food: it's just not anything worth paying the price for. I had Bang Bang chicken and shrimp, it was labelled as spicy and I asked for it to be extra spicy, there was no spice at all.  My fiance had orange chicken. It was plain and less than one would expect from a basic chinese take-away. The other person we were with ordered meatloaf, it was actually ok but the mashed potatoes were cool by the time it was run to our table. I honestly think that the restaurant just has too many things on that menu to get all of the items right. Positives: the iced tea was good (this matters a lot to me) as were the mojitos the ladies ordered. Two of our deserts were great (I guess this is really why people go here), the tiramisu cheesecake was still thawing when it was brought to us so it was a bit hard in the middle."
Ron P.,"Irwin, PA",0,32,4,4.0,2/10/2015,"not bad, long wait.... floor is slippery. Staff is very friendly... great Food"
Doug C.,"Mount Lebanon, PA",3,51,,4.0,7/12/2011,"The food is consistent and very good. I have 2  favorites, louisiana pasta and the southwest chicken salad. Both are always excellent however I have noticed the amount of chicken in the lunch salad has become smaller. The portions are too large so my wife and I often split an entree. The vanilla bean cheesecake is perfect and during the holidays the pumpkin is worth a trip.  The bad. They can't make a cocktail to save their life.you have to chill the martini glass first and if the alcohol is an inch below the rim you've done something wrong. I have attempted drinks here 3 times. Never again. Service is usually top notch."
Joe D.,"Pittsburgh, PA",405,549,447,2.0,3/23/2011,"This place is a true piece of Americana, for gluttons, and overindulgence. Really? Does a lunch size portion of Mac & Cheese need to be over 3200 calories with over 100 grams of fat? Do chicken breast sandwiches need to look like the meat came from a chicken grown in Chernoble? Let's explore further, cheesecake without sugar? Makes sense for those who are diabetic. But let's really see who orders sugar free cheesecake. More than likely it's the people who devour the previously mentioned mac & cheese, then to ease that guilt, order the sugar free cheesecake, that has over 50 grams of fat because it's made with cream cheese and eggs., and served with a huge dollop of real whipped cream, which by the way contains SUGAR.              Ok, let me be fare, once in awhile this place can be good, like once every few months. I've eaten there and I used to be a big eater, and as a lover of food I was impressed by the portions. They are so big i could take most of the meal home and eat it for lunch and dinner the next day. It's a bit expensive, but for what you get it's worth the extra spending."
Eric L.,"Cambridge, MA",208,156,161,2.0,3/16/2010,"(start rant) I don't like reviewing chain restaurants b/c well.... they're chains.  And the pro's / con's of a chain typically persist from restaurant to restaurant.  This review is no different. Cheesecake Factory has decent food w/ large portions.  There's something for everyone on the menu.  Except those watching their figure.  If you've never seen their nutritional information before and aren't in the mood to cry, stop reading.  For everyone else, read on. ********** Let's start with a chicken quesadilla for an appetizer to split!  Oh wait, that's 1270 calories?  With 38 grams of saturated fat?  and 2270 mg of sodium?  Hmm, let's skip that and grab our entrees. I hear their Chicken Madeira is pretty tasty!  Oh hi there 1420 calories, 44 grams of saturated fat and over 2000 mg of sodium!  How about some pasta?  I hear their Bistro Shrimp pasta is legit!  Oh wait, it's 2290 calories and has 73 grams of saturated fat...  I guess I'll get some healthy seafood instead...  That miso salmon sounds good!  And so does the 1670 calories that come with it, along with its 39 grams of saturated fat and over a day's worth of sodium!  (note: none of these figures include any sides: add a mashed potatoes and you get an additional 560 calories) I think I'll stick with a salad...  how about the grilled chicken tostada salad?  The chicken is grilled so it HAS to be healthy right?  If 1130 calories with 2150 mg of sodium is healthy, then I guess so...  (here's a note of comparison: two Big Macs actually has less calories and sodium than this salad.) Add any slice of cheesecake and you have over a day's worth of calories and fat and sodium (all cheesecakes have at least 300 mg of sodium and some specialty desserts have over 1000 mg) ********** I don't mind calorie laden food, but I'd rather save my calories for tastier food elsewhere.  Yes restaurant food is typically bad for you, but if I'm dropping $20-$30 for dinner at a place and it's going to be bad for me, the food better be delicious, and taking reservations might be nice too.  Since Cheesecake Factory doesn't take reservations and the food isn't all that great, I feel no remorse whenever I pass by Cheesecake Factory in lieu of other restaurants. (end rant) Okay Cheesecake Factory isn't the spawn of the devil as I had put it out to be, and it's not too bad for larger parties with picky eaters.  And it's not like I'm going to cry if I were to go back again and again, it just wouldn't be my first choice for dinner.... or second, or third, or fourth or fifth... Sorry ladies; you better pick somewhere else to go for that girl's night out if you want that killer beach bod in time for summer."
Nicole L.,"Fort Washington, PA",26,46,146,4.0,11/30/2013,"Normally very busy. I usually sit at the bar or grab a slice of the White Chocolate Red Velvet cheesecake. The wings are good, but that's only as far as I've went eating wise. I can't remember the name of the bartender but she made a good margarita! Drinks and Cheesecake are my go to."
Tamara M.,"Slippery Rock, PA",59,10,6,1.0,3/15/2010,"This is gonna be a short review. I can't think of any reason to recommend you eat here. Sure, it's hard to believe that a restaurant with the word cheesecake in its name could in any way disappoint. But believe it.  This restaurant boasts of having 200 dishes on its menu. Points for variety? Nope, what this says to me is that instead of making a handful of dishes really well, they endeavor to make 200 mediocre ones. I've eaten here twice and sampled the entrees of my table-mates, so I'd say I've tried about 8 dishes. All were mediocre - neither great nor shitty. Think: the approximate quality of any decent hospital cafeteria food. At 3 times the cost. The desserts rank a bit better on the taste scale but not by much. The decor is gawd-awful."
