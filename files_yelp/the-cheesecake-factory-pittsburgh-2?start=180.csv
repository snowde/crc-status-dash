Rob S.,"Cheswick, PA",47,7,3,4.0,8/13/2013,Always good service and a good meal. Packed with calories but you know that going in right? This time I had the Macaroni and Cheesburger..It was fab! I had my usual Arnold Palmer and an early Sam Adams Oktoberfest beer...I took a togo bag with a slice of White Chocolate Cheesecake. Excellent!
Patti T.,"Pittsburgh, PA",13,43,1,4.0,1/6/2011,"First up: know that I've never been a huge fan of Cheesecake Factory, mainly because the portion sizes are so huge. I don't want all that food, nor do I want to PAY for all that food that I do not want... Got some gift cards for Christmas, so off we went. They've got a new (new to me, anyway) menu section of starters/small plates, separate from the appetizer menu, which I think is just PERFECT and completely removes my primary gripe with the restaurant!  I had their Vietnamese Tacos--bbq pork and crunchy, fresh and spicy cucumber/carrot slaw on steamed buns (3). DELICIOUS! The steamed buns were slightly sweet, so soft...it was a perfect combination for me. I think it was $6.95.  I had a similar sandwich at Emeril Lagasse's NOLA, and I have to say that this one was much tastier. I underestimated the portion on the small plate and also ordered a pear, arugula & Gorgonzola flatbread (maybe they call it a pizzette?). Was lovely, but I took most of it home and enjoyed it for lunch today.  Skipped the cheesecake and desserts. Just tryin to be good.  Service was great. All in all, they've gotten themselves a new return customer by offering the choice of not getting 3 days' worth of meals on one plate. Yay!"
Rachel L.,"Zelienople, PA",0,4,,5.0,10/9/2013,"My boyfriend and I went out for dinner there yesterday night while enjoying a nice night out together, and after our terrible experience with the place we had chosen for lunch, The Cheesecake Factory was a relief. Our service was exceptional, Laura waited on us and she couldn't have done a better job. She was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and let us take our time and choose what we wanted. Everything was absolutely delicious from the Georgia Peach I ordered from the bar menu to the S'mores Cheesecake I had for dessert. Keep it up CCF always a good choice and we will definitely be back! Yummy - Orange chicken leftovers!!"
Justin P.,"Smock, PA",3,25,4,4.0,3/30/2013,"The Cheesecake Factory is about 1 hr & 10 mins away from me. I live in Uniontown, so I love to travel to Pittsburgh every now and then for a wider variety of restaurants, shopping malls, and more. This place is to die for! I had a spicy chicken sandwich with fries, which was HUGE! Great size for the price! And of course, the main reason I go is the cheesecake. Oh my God. The Reese's Cheesecake is heaven. The building is gigantic, and beautiful. It has a nice patio, and a garden area to sit down in. Plus, all of the shops downtown make it a great, and busy spot! Which is the only downfall, it is way too busy! I waited an hour and a half just for my friend and I to eat here, but in the end, it was well worth it!"
Glenn M.,"West Aliquippa, PA",0,13,,5.0,4/28/2013,"The menu is massive. Sarah T was a patient and attentive server. The food was plentiful, well seasoned and casually prompt. We'll be back!"
Pat P.,"Asheville, NC",1,28,,2.0,12/7/2009,"No complaints about the food, it was tasty and plentiful.  However, we had two major complaints about the service: 1) We specifically asked the hostess for the quietest possible table. She said ""sure"", and then proceeded to seat us right next to the server's station, where they were constantly banging and crashing plates and silverware around. Numerous times I had to plug my ear with a finger to block out the noise.  This in itself pretty much ruined the meal.   2) The server was waaaay too ""attentive"". He was artificially perky and chatty and was constantly interrupting us with ""how are things"" and ""don't forget to leave room for dessert"", etc etc.   We had been trying to have a serious conversation over lunch but actually gave up on that due to the waiters constant (and unnecessary) interruptions.  Between the deafening noise and the pushy server, we had a rather negative experience. Update Feb 21st:  I sent CF a link to this review. The manager of the location sent us a $15 gift card and an apology for our experience. We went back and had a nice dining experience. Food was great, waiter was not pushy at all. Thanks, Cheesecake Factory!"
Sal G.,"Miami, FL",215,810,80,2.0,11/18/2009,"I came here several years ago and had my only poor experience at a Cheesecake Factory.  I thought maybe it was just that I didn't order the proper items.  Over the years, I have learned what I like here and so as to properly rate, I ordered those items: Buffalo Blasts Classic Burger with Cheese (plain) First and foremost, the service was poor.  There are a bunch of ""Wanna Be"" GUPPIES that work at this place and they have that certain mentality where everything smells of roses.  This transferred from Host to Servers to Runners.  I am trying to understand why the Runners were so arrogant.  Have you ever seen a trash man get a snooty/snotty arrogance when he talks about his job?  Oh to see the day.   The server finally took our order after several minutes of waiting.  The buffalo blasts arrived and they were good.  Just as I remember them from every other Cheesecake Factore.  They are basically an empanada (or meat pie) filled with shredded chicken, cheese and some buffalo sauce.  There is some additional buffalo sauce on the side and some peppered blue cheese dressing brought along for dipping.  Yes, this was good.  It was the highlight of this meal. Our cheeseburger arrived.  I don't know what they did, but the flavor was off; it tasted as though they had saturated the bun in mayonaise or butter and then put it on the grill and then put additional fat on the hamburger patty.  I ate it, but I was less than thrilled with what was in front of me. I could have given this restaurant a 3 for the Buffalo Blasts alone, but the GUPPIES just ruined it for me.  I doubt they have ever lived in a true urban setting...pompous mules."
Carmen R.,"Venetia, PA",16,22,,2.0,7/22/2012,"The menu is so large one immediately begins to wonder if they can do anything well.   Jack of all trades, master of none.  However, as far as chains go, and I lump them in with places like Red Lobster, Olive Garden, etc. I have to say they do decent job.  I had the stuffed mushrooms to start, they were covered in a cheese sauce that didn't need to be there.  My dinner was a piece of overcooked salmon, that I am still not really convinced that it was actually salmon.  The portions are huge, which seems to delight the typical Pittsburgher for some reason, though not me.  The wait staff was attentive, though I the wait for bar drinks took some time.  I didn't try the cheesecake but from what I hear it is good.  We had a table of 13, and didn't take reservations  which is a little frustrating."
C P.,"Nashville, TN",0,23,5,4.0,12/4/2013,"Lately, things have improved - decided to give this place another chance after getting gift cards for filling out survey. Meal quality now consistent, take-out service improved (weekends are understandably quite busy here). Back to being a regular  yay!"
Karissa K.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,7,1,5.0,7/23/2014,"Great atmosphere,  good portion size, speedy service,  easy parking, and amazing cheesecake."
David C.,"Harper Woods, MI",1,25,,4.0,1/13/2013,"As always, the Cheesecake Factory did not disappoint."
Lucretiz C.,"Pittsburgh, PA",799,419,493,2.0,2/18/2012,"I would rather eat cardboard with a little seasoning salt on it, there have another meal here at the cheese cake factory.  My last time here I ordered a pasta dish the pasta was dry and the tomato sauce did not adhere to the noodles.  Aladdin's cheese cake better any way ."
Evan S.,"McKnight, PA",250,78,44,4.0,10/30/2011,"To preface; I generally HATE chain restaurants. This however, is my favorite chain in the world. Huge variety, consistent quality, and a great bar. Oh yah, the light fixtures and marble/wood accents give the place a warm feeling. I've eaten at all the high end places in and around Pittsburgh: this place is a guilty pleasure. FYI: if you're a food glutton: come on in! The only negative with this place: cleanliness is less then perfect."
Marla K.,"Pittsburgh, PA",100,90,37,4.0,12/2/2011,"I always love eating here. It is a little overpriced but I've never gotten any food I didn't like or bad service. I'm partial to the chicken alfredo. Cheesecake Factory makes it the best. I usually bring my parents here when they come to visit from the State College area, where there is no Cheesecake Factory."
Shana H.,"Holiday, FL",25,74,57,3.0,2/17/2012,"The food is ok, not exactly the greatest I've ever had. When I walk in just by looking how decked out the place is, I think I'm gonna get amazing food but I didn't. It's a little over priced. The only thing I really appreciated about the cheese cake factory is their cheesecake. Banana cheesecake, coconut cream pie cheesecake, tirimisu cheesecake, the list goes on and on of awesome cheesecakes that they rock at making. Id go their just for the cheesecake. The place is packed on the weekends...too packed for me. Overall ok place."
e y.,"Palo Alto, CA",0,22,,3.0,7/8/2011,"Love the Cheesecake Factory! ...but the server behaved badly.  We were sitting at the tall tables by the bar; the server stood to the left of my companion, then reached across her plate to place a cup of hot coffee on the right! When the server did this a second time, I made a comment, but the server got defensive.  To this Cheesecake Factory manager: consider training your waitstaff with the basics: - ""serve from the left, clear from the right"" - ""the customer is always right""...never defend a behavior that a customer is unhappy about, simply apologize"
Edward B.,"Irwin, PA",0,7,,3.0,3/8/2014,"The main reason I am giving this restaurant three out of five stars is because of their wait times. The wait times here are absolutely atrocious and they do NOT take reservations which I find absolutely ridiculous. It's their company policy that there is not wait times, however, this location is the only Cheesecake Factory in Pittsburgh and gets too much attention and they should start doing it. I like to take my 62 year old mother here and she does not want to wait over an hour to get a seat when on medication and with a bad hip. We came here once before a concert to to see the Transiberian Orchestra. They told us the wait would be 45 minutes and we waited 1 hour and 15 minutes and eventually left. The second time was today, after the failed to take my reservation I walk in and the place was packed like sardines. I didn't even bother asking how long of a wait, as it was probably over an hour. My moms birthday dinner was fast food now because this place (as well as it's surrounding restaurants) are all too busy. I don't know what it is about the south side, people just love this area.  I love the food here and that's the reason it's popular. Their chicken marsala is hands down the best dish I've ever had at any restaurant, beating out traditional, family owned restaurants and the works. The cheesecake as well is their mean thing, it's excellent and although severely overpriced they at least give you a huge slice. They've got a huge menu to pick from and their alcohol is also excellent with probably the best margarita's I've ever had. If you want to eat here, I recommend going on a secluded business day when everyone is working. in the past, I used to get seated in 10-20 minutes, but in the past couple months the wait times have been unacceptable. I also don't trust how well their cooks and staff can keep up with so many people if they cook the food well enough, I mean this place gets stupidly busy."
K D.,"Hibbing, MN",0,11,,2.0,4/19/2012,"Within the last few months I went twice while visiting Pittsburgh.  The first time I had the Miso Salmon, miso glazed salmon on a bed of brown rice with sugar snap peas.  Absolutely excellent...except that the dish contained only 5, maybe 6, snap peas.  I didn't get my veggie serving in on that meal. The second time I had the Chicken Marsala over Bow Tie Pasta.  The pasta was gummy and hard...like they only cooked it part way in prep and hoped it would cook fully after  tossing it in the pan and putting it under the hot lights -- which it was because the top layer of pasta was hardened.  The flavor was good, but there was not enough sauce.  The sauce was overly greasy, too.   It came with four tender, pounded thin, chicken breast pieces, about the 4 or 5 inches in diameter.   I ate half of it, carefully saving a lot of mushrooms (button and shitake) because they gave the most flavor to the dish plus two of the four chicken pieces, so I could have some take home in my hotel.  However, when I opened the take home container the next night, I had only one chicken piece and, literally, one slice each of button and shitake. WTF?  Where the heck did the rest of meal go to???   Because of this and the loud back room (steerage, I joked, to my companions) where  they seat the undesirables -- drunken parties, families with children, teen dates, and underdressed folk (which we were because we had just come from the airport on both occasions) I gave only two stars.  I would have given one if not for the awesome salmon (which I ordered rare and they actually obliged!)"
Dave P.,"Pittsburgh, PA",85,190,6,3.0,6/24/2009,"I have been to several cheesecake factories and like this one the best. The cuban sandwich is a delight.  Try it.  They also have some healthier options that are actually GOOD.  The last time I was there the waiter was a delight.  She worked really hard and did a great job. Yes, its probably pricier then it should be but the cheesecake factory doesn't pretend to be cheap. Get the heath bar cheesecake.  It's just that good."
Ryan P.,"Pittsburgh, PA",93,321,271,2.0,3/14/2009,"The cheesecake is good and the waitstaff tend to be friendly, but the food definitely leaves a lot to be desired. I've had several entrées and appetizers here and not been impressed by any of them. I'd especially recommend avoiding the nachos! That said, it's a decent place to go late night for dessert."
