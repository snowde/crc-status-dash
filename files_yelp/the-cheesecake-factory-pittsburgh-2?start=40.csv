Thomas A.,"Pittsburgh, PA",9,31,8,3.0,2/27/2017,"Started with the Thai lettuce wraps, which I always do when I'm here. Had the blackened shrimp and chicken which was very good . Very little on the plate though. I tried their cheesecake for the first time. That changed my perception of cheesecake because what I've tried before(not here)I never liked it. only real problem I had was the waiter took so long to come back with my cheesecake and check. My meter expired and I got a $25 ticket"
Rissa D.,"Pittsburgh, PA",29,65,88,3.0,1/30/2017,"I'm actually really disappointed with my recent visit to the Cheesecake Factory. I think that three stars is rather generous for the sloppy salad and slow service during the lunch hour. I ordered a French Country Salad with crasins instead of beets, while my lunch buddy decided to get the Caesar salad. After we placed our order, the server brought out bread; however, there was only one type of bread in the basket to our disappointment, but oh well no biggie at this point. We didn't see it sever until our food was brought out, which seemed to take quite awhile, but again, no big deal at this point. However, as soon as I went to dig into my salad I noticed that the bits of asparagus, nuts, and goat cheese were all under my lettuce mix. This was strange. I asked the server where my crasins were she said oh sorry I had the cook make you a new salad since we put them directly on the salad (I asked for them on the side because I wasn't sure what I was going to get, crasins or actual cranberries). So, I doubt I got a new salad and just had the crasins taken out, which was why all of my toppings were under the salad. Again, this wasn't a big deal until I noticed that I had a lot of wilted and mushy lettuce in my salad. I was really really disappointed because that's just plain gross. I had the blackish pieces that get all slimy and stick to the other leaves.  Overall, the service wasn't anything to write home about and the salad quality wasn't very good."
Amber P.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,3,1,1.0,11/2/2016,Being from south side I frequent the Cheesecake Factory quite a bit. I called tonight to place a to go order. They kept me on hold for 8 mins and 40sec. Which I feel is completely unacceptable. When I asked to spoke to the manager he seemed more irritated that I was wasting his time with my complaint rather then trying to rectify the problem. I will NEVER visit this location again. I can spend my money where it is more appreciated.
Lisa J.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",92,3,1,1.0,4/15/2017,"Tonight has been the worst service ever. Our waitress was rude and very disrespectful. Manager was rude and disoriented. The food was cold, bland, took over an hour as the messed up our order. Been here several times before with no issues. This place has gone way down hill!"
Nitish R.,"Canonsburg, PA",21,18,15,3.0,6/5/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory has good American food and is more upscale than your usual Applebee's or TGI Friday's. They have extensive food as well as drink menu - some of which are good and others not so much. The sandwiches and salads are tasty but I would stay away from their ""chinese"" food. My personal top orders are the Grande Burrito and Luau Salad. For appetizer, the Factory Nachos are the way to go. Warm, crunchy nachos with pulled chicken, salsa, sour cream, cheese, jalapenos, beans, guac and probably more. And of course their cheesecakes are very good - never had a bad one. Getting a table there can be a long affair if you go during peak times so go during off hours if you can. The level of service is also directly correlated to how busy they are in my experience.  All in all, not a bad place if you're looking for a casual dining experience and some great cheesecake."
Richard B.,"Pittsburgh, PA",21,12,,5.0,4/4/2017,Absolutely excellent menu choices. Â Miso salmon is the best tasting salmon dish I've ever eaten.
Celeste A.,"Pittsburgh, PA",278,35,2,3.0,11/25/2016,"The food is always good- which is why I come back. My burger was over cooked and it still tasted fine. However the service is never fantastic, today exemplified that. Took 5+ minutes to be waited on, and even longer to get our checks. It wasn't particularly busy at that time either. Overall, once every few years is enough here."
Chelsea M.,"Pittsburgh, PA",304,744,469,4.0,10/27/2015,"We stopped in to celebrate my moms birthday. She doesnt get out much so i knew she'd be blown away by CF. We ordered macaroni and cheese balls for appetizer. For dinner, I ordered the Shrimp & Chicken Gumbo. Bobby ordered the Bang Bang Chicken & Shrimp. My picky mom went to the servers suggestion of Chicken Madiera. I tried everyone's dish and all of it was tasty.  For dessert, I ordered the simple strawberry cheesecake.. amazing. Kayla was our server and she was a great one. I'm gonna keep this short and sweet ;)"
Taylor W.,"Pittsburgh, PA",129,8,4,2.0,2/9/2017,"I love cheese cake, and I normally love the Cheesecake Factory. I have been to this location multiple times and have never really had a bad experience until just recently. My family and I ordered take out from here one night, an order that totaled over $90. Out of four different plates we orders, three of them were incomplete. The two chicken Caesar salads had barely any chicken on them, and they didn't even give the Caesar dressing for them; I ordered a burger and side salad for my meal, and I was only given the burger NO SALAD!!! Upon calling the restaurant back, we received an apology and offer of a gift card for accommodation. When we received the card in the mail, it was a $15 gift card... $15 on a $90 order that messed up 3 of the 4 meals! I'm not over here trying to sound ungrateful, but a $15 gift card wouldn't even cover one of the incomplete meals ordered. Unbelievable!"
C C.,"Pittsburgh, PA",8,225,281,3.0,7/31/2016,"The National Cheesecake Day deal was just too good to miss. I, being the sugar-addicted dessert aficionado that I am, had to visit not just once, but twice. If I lived closer I probably would have gone for all four meals during the two-day promotion. Overall, the service was timely, professional, and attentive. The decor, atmosphere, and layout are that of a typical Cheesecake Factory: could be great for a date, but no one cares if you show up in a t-shirt and jeans. The quality of the food is great, but the prices are a little high for it to be more than the occasional treat (especially for a college student). The menu is very large, which can be a little overwhelming. I stopped by on Friday afternoon around 2:30 pm with a friend. We were seated at a table outside within a few minutes. The complimentary bread was yummy; I prefer the honey wheat brown bread to the sourdough because it is softer. I ordered the roasted pear and blue cheese flatbread, and my friend got the avocado, zucchini, and portabella fries, which were served with two dips. These were considered ""small plates and snacks"" on the menu and cost $6.50 each. Without cheesecake, the portion sizes would not have filled me up. (But I guess that's the point, I've never gone to the Cheesecake Factory and not gotten cheesecake). I enjoyed my flatbread--it had a great, crunchy crust. The amount of toppings was perfect, although the flavor profile isn't one that I particularly cared for (just my tastebuds, though). My friend enjoyed her ""fries"" as well, especially the zucchini ones.  Then, of course, we ordered cheesecake. We split the new Chocolate Hazelnut Crunch and Adam's Peanut Butter Fudge Ripple. The Chocolate Hazelnut Crunch had a great, strong hazelnut flavor; however, I found myself missing the bitterness of the chocolate to balance out the sweetness. Adam's Peanut Butter Fudge Ripple was even sweeter, being loaded with candy bars and caramel. The plain cheesecake at the edge that didn't get the caramel swirl or candy bits was a relief. I returned again on Saturday around 1 pm by myself. This time, I ordered the Tomato Mozzarella Toast, which was much more in line with my tastes. The crunchy bread was perfect, the tomatoes were sweet and juicy, and the pesto burst with flavor. Really delicious, if a little overpriced at $8.50. After my sweetness overload from the previous day, I decided to go with the Tiramisu Cheesecake. The coffee provided the bitterness I was looking for; this one was not too sweet for my tastes. However, the cheesecake itself could have been richer. So, bottom line: pretty good. If I'm going to be picky, food is pricey. Cheesecake flavors are cool, but I prefer richer cheesecakes that are more tangy than sweet. But they're good to satisfy my need for sugar. If it wasn't for the promotion, I wouldn't have visited, and I doubt I will soon if not for a special occasion."
Etta P.,"Pittsburgh, PA",169,15,6,5.0,6/19/2016,"I've never been to a Cheesecake Factory that didn't deserve 5 stars. Yes, they're pricy but they're always well worth it. My waitress was a young girl (I feel bad I forgot her name) but she was sweet and fun to talk to. Great service.  I took myself to the Southside location recently after a long day of shopping and was sat right away. Restaurant is always clean, comfortable, has friendly staff members, and DELICIOUS!  I can only imagine how lame it sounds to say that the free bread appetizer is my favorite part every time I come in, but really it is. I always look forward to it. I ordered the tomato basil pasta dish and it was phenomenal, just heated up the leftovers tonight for dinner and it tasted just as good. Of course, I also enjoyed some cheesecake for dessert (strawberry this time around), and I swear they have the best cheesecake on this earth. I have never been let down by the Cheesecake Factory and I know I'll be back many times in my life.  Use to be one of my favorite date night spots and their sirloin with mashed potatoes is some of the best steak I've had in a long time that was under $40. Keep it up Cheesecake Factory!"
Karin Z.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,18,25,5.0,9/11/2016,"Am not into cheesecake so why would I go here? My friends wanted to go! I love chocolate, and they had selections of chocolate cake that were not cheesecake. We got the cake to go and did not do sit down service. I got the chocolate tower truffle cake. It was incredible. It had a fudgy layer, then airy bread, then very light mousse. The lightness of the cake with the heavier fudge made it a great combination. It was pleasant for the palate, not too heavy or too sweet. I asked for extra whipped cream. It was great to have extra whipped cream because the cream was not sweet. It was also neutral and light, which helped with eating the heavier fudge part of the cake. It also lasted me 6 days to eat everyday. Loved it!!! Such a good deal!"
Prevan Michelle R.,"Export, PA",16,11,3,5.0,8/13/2016,Love coming here and spending a small fortune on wonderful food!!! I get the shrimp scampi everytime!!!and my husband gets the steak Diane we never have any problems. The service is excellent. Â Sometimes there is a wait..but the food is worth the wait.
Jack M.,"McKeesport, PA",9,7,,2.0,8/16/2017,"I went here for my birthday with my family a little while back and I can tell you I was pretty dissapointed. The decor and vibe of the whole place was very sophisticated and pleasing to look at. We waited probably about 45 minutes just for our appetizers to come, and I got the fried mac and cheese bites. They were pretty good, but they were burnt. The bread they served was pretty stale. It felt like an eternity waiting for our main dish. My sister's boyfriend got the wrong meal several times, and my meal (which I believe was a penne four cheese pasta with chicken) was salty, the sauce was horrible and the chicken was pretty soggy. My brother got a burger that was meant to be medium rare and he got well done, as well. The staff treated us like little children. The cheesecake was pretty okay, but it was pretty much the same thing you could get from the grocery store. We got our bill reduced due to mistakes, and it somehow still came out to be about $300. Overall, very mediocre for such a high price."
Dan T.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,15,,1.0,7/30/2017,"My wife and visited this cheesecake location earlier today for lunch....what a fiasco! Waited almost 50 minutes for food.... because waitress forgot to turn in our order......when my chicken salad finally arrived....wait for it... wait for it....it had NO chicken. For this I got two "" sorry about that"" from the waitress and no apology/acknowledgement whatsoever the the manager??"
Tze-Chien Y.,"Seattle, WA",2,1,1,4.0,12/28/2016,"Ordered Steak Diane, medium rare. The food and service is great, however had to wait more than 20 minutes for the plate to be served."
Destiny R.,"Burtonsville, MD",394,260,275,5.0,5/27/2016,"I have eaten at Cheesecake Factory in Pittsburgh Waterfront, White Flint Mall, and at Arundel Mills Mall. All are tasty. Their menu is extensive and they are consistent. I particularly like their chicken samosas and asian sesame potstickers. I can vouch for their spaghetti as well. This is one of the few restaurants you will go to with a menu that shares shepherd's pie and sushi. I like their raspberry lemonade."
Christine K.,"Champion, PA",52,1,,5.0,1/29/2017,Absolutely love the cheesecake factory. Our server this evening was amazing and recommend a delish dish. She made us feel like we were her only customer
Shana M.,"Pittsburgh, PA",34,61,7,3.0,1/8/2017,"The menu is huge and the portions even bigger. The food is mediocre, I feel like they depend more on portion size rather than actual flavor. The cheesecake is good but nothing spectacular."
Keith W.,"York, PA",21,30,3,5.0,5/7/2016,"Big fan of the Cheesecake Factory  Love their Sheppard's Pie and tex Mex egg rolls, but honestly, I've never had anything but great food there. Will definitely be there again!"
