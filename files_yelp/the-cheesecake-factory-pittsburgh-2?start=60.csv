Judy P.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,5,,2.0,6/14/2017,"Have been to The Cheesecake Factory twice in the last two weeks. Each occasion we went, we purposely arrived between lunch and dinner when it wasn't crowded.We still waited for over 25 minutes for our meals (we ordered salads) .When we asked for extra dressing, another 10 minutes passed...Like I said, it was not crowded so I don't understand the wait. The second time we went, the same thing happened, but it took even longer to get our meals. Our waiter seemed distracted and rushed even though he was waiting on only 3 tables. We waited over 20 minutes for him to bring us the check. Ridiculous. Food okay and over-priced. Good service should be a priority. Also, music is too loud."
Sarah W.,"Pittsburgh, PA",272,81,170,3.0,1/12/2014,"Not a fan of chains, but I got a gift card for Christmas. I was surprised that they had a decent gluten free menu, including gf bread/buns and pasta. I ordered gf pasta tossed with veggies and pine nuts, enough for 3 portions. It was good and all of the vegetables were cooked nicely. The appetizer was tamale cakes topped with corn, avocado, and sour cream. They were tasty, but heavy and filling. For dessert I ordered the Godiva flour less cheesecake, the only gf cheesecake on the menu. It was great! Drinks and wines are grossly over priced and the price is something like $10.89 or $7.50 ... Anything with cents in the price bugs me. There was only a 10 minute wait for a table and the ginormous bar was practically empty, and made out wait more comfortable. Overall, service was ok, food was ok."
Deb S.,"New Castle, PA",0,2,,1.0,12/7/2016,"Just terrible.. Ordered orange chicken- tasted like fish . Sent it back,second dinner cold. Manager never came to the table . Obviously , don't care about the customer."
Mara K.,"Pittsburgh, PA",152,280,19,4.0,1/8/2015,"I know this place is a bit of a cliche, and yes, it's a chain, and blah, blah, blah, but I can't stop coming here.  Is it the 20 page menu?  The spacious establishment?  The delicious fresh bread that comes out while you wait for your entree?  Honestly, I think it is all those things, but for me, it's the one page ""skinny"" menu with the low cal/low fat options.  These healthy creations are not only tasty, but the portions are nice, and you have several options.  The ""Skinnylicious"" menu ranges from salads, to fish, to pasta, to steak, to tacos.  And the list goes on.  So yeah, I go to the Cheesecake Factory and I'm not mad about it.   I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that they have an amazing assortment of cheesecake.  I don't usually partake, but often I'm talked into sharing a piece with a friend or a group, and I've had some damn good cheesecake here.  My favorite is Oreo or cookie dough.  Or dulce de leche.  Or mango.  Ok, so maybe I do partake in the cheesecake.  But cut me a break, I saved oh so many calories by ordering from the Skinnylicious menu!"
Maria I.,"Oceanside, CA",27,156,82,4.0,1/20/2015,"I don't really come here a lot because it's always insanely busy (when I would go, anyway) and the wait is like a million years long. I went with a friend here last Friday spur of the moment and she called ahead to see what the wait was. They told her over the phone there was no wait and when she showed up before me like 10-15 minutes later the wait was all of a sudden 40 minutes long. What. Thankfully, she knew someone and she was able to get a table quicker. I got there when she was already seated and the crowd was out of control. It seems there's no rhyme or reason to the throng of people because everyone stands in a big huddle and sometimes blocks the entrance. Annoying. We had a nice man as our waiter and his customer service was fabulous. We weren't ignored and he was prompt in coming back to fill water and get our orders. I loved the bread that comes out while we waited for our food. We both ordered salads - for me a Luau salad and for my friend a Cobb. Who orders salads at Cheesecake Factory, right? Ha. When they came out, it was like 2-3 portions on one plate. My salad has a variety of flavors and ingredients. It was really, really good. In the middle of the salad there were these two flat pieces of something crunchy. It tasted like it was coated with something sweet and sesame seeds. I took a few bites of it and scooped my salad with it. The customer service and food (enough for a good amount of leftovers!) was great! I don't prefer the crowd and wait times though."
Nadia S.,"Cranberry Township, PA",0,4,,4.0,11/22/2016,"The wait is always ridiculous (have more seating in the lobby for those who are older), but every time my family receives  incredible service. I brought my mother in for her birthday, & our server was nothing short of professional and kind. Exactly how a waitress should take care of a table. I'm impressed, & I wish I could remember her name to request her every time we come."
Barry R.,"Pittsburgh, PA",511,206,9,4.0,1/7/2016,"I almost never write reviews for corporate franchise chain restaurants, but every Cheesecake Factory I've been too has been shockingly good.  It's roughly the same price as an Applebee's or Olive Garden, but you get a much better experience for your money. Consistent, freshly prepared dishes, with intense flavors and comically large portions. Pleasant decor and atmosphere.  Very friendly and attentive staff.  Despite their name, it's a great place to come even if you don't like cheesecake.  It's got an endless menu with over 100 options, for every palette and preference. Some companies are big, because they're big.  Other's are big, because they deserve to be.  Treat yourself to a Cadillac at Chevy prices.  I think you get a better experience for the money here, than any other large chain out there."
Nicole M.,"Pittsburgh, PA",243,232,131,4.0,12/2/2016,"I feel like Cheesecake Factory is one of those restaurants you either love or you hate. I love it. Their menu is super extensive and it's fantastic that they offer a ""Skinnylicious"" menu for people like me who don't want to eat a 3,000 calories meal followed by a 1,200 slice of cheesecake. Their wine by the glass list is laughable, but their full bar makes up for it. My favorite thing to eat is the Ahi Tuna Carpaccio (very sushi-like) and, of course, the cheesecake. Service is always really good (we typically sit at the bar) and fast and any special requests are respected without question (e.g. sauce on the side) or complaint. Despite being a massive restaurant, it is usually packed to the gills with diners, but they turn tables quickly enough that as long as you don't have a large party, wait times are kept to minimum. They will also validate your parking (2 hours) for any of the Southside Works garages. If Cheesecake Factory wants a 5th star, they need to bring back the White Chocolate Blueberry cheesecake (why they discontinued my favorite cheesecake in the first place is beyond me)."
Simone H.,"Atlanta, GA",273,290,179,4.0,3/5/2015,"Go to Italian for all times I hang out with my friend J in the Southside. It's simple and quick and close and the menu is large enough to cut through most cravings. I get. This location get super crowded on Friday and Saturday nights, Sunday brunch/lunch because it's super close to all the Universities and a magnet for families and groups.   The menu is your standard Italian and I personally like the service at this location over the North Hills Ross Park Mall version [home mall] where it's hit or miss. After you get past a possible wait it's smooth sailing, everybody pitches into the process from food running and clearing the table, refilling glasses and bringing bread. It's a machine. Awesome. My favorite for this restaurant is the skinnylicious menu from drinks to salads and foods. I love the mix of asparagus as their go-to veggie and they even manage to sneak in a bunch of carbs in too whether some mashed potatoes [steak dish] or angel hair [shrimp-lemon with asparagus]. very good. PS: do chew your food and not engulf like I do... I completely understand how people can choke to death. Of course get some cheesecake to go. We bought the Pecan Truffle [and a couple extra ingredients] goodness and the White chocolate Macadamian Nut. [Yum]. Just a hint - these do NOT work when you're sipping Apple Martinis. NO. Will come again"
Amy C.,"Pittsburgh, PA",168,430,1429,3.0,9/20/2015,"Went to celebrate my niece's 16th birthday (omg, my niece is 16). She picked the place. It was good but not great. At least the cheesecake was amazing! Been to the cheesecake factory before. I feel like the menu is way too big. I feel the food could be phenomenal but there is just way too much on the menu. We were seated immediately and were waited on promptly by our wonderful waitress. She was great the entire time we were there. I chose the herb encrusted salmon with the lemon sauce on the side. The fish was way overcooked but the asparagus and mashed potatoes were yummy. My niece chose fettuccine Alfredo and thought is was delightful. My sister chose the ahi tuna salad and raved about it. The hubby got the Cuban sandwich and liked it a lot noting a little greasy but good. My mom got the chicken salad sandwich and liked it other than the fact it was too much to eat. My dad got some sort of chicken and liked it (I am not sure what kind of chicken because he was at the opposite end of the table). Then dessert. You can't go to the cheesecake factory and not get dessert. Me and my mom got the strawberry classic. Light and tasty! The hubby chose tiramisu which he thoroughly enjoyed (it too was good, good flavor and a huge portion). My dad got chocolate cake which he devoured. My sister got the salted caramel pretzel, wow! It was heavier but man was it scrumptious! And the birthday girl chose the tuxedo which was chocolatey and good! All in all the food was just okay. The wait staff was terrific and the dessert is phenomenal!"
Madeline N.,"West Mifflin, PA",56,68,29,2.0,1/1/2016,"I've waited a couple visits to review The Cheesecake Factory because I've had some mediocre experiences that I thought might not have been very representative of their usual quality of service and food.  Unfortunately, my most recent visit was really unpleasant, and I feel that the mediocre experiences I've had in the past are probably as good as it can get.   Our most recent visit was on a busy night, and the wait was about a half an hour. We were pleasantly surprised that we were seated in only about 20 minutes, but it was only down hill from there.  We ordered the grilled artichoke as an appetizer (which probably wasn't the strongest choice considering the other options), but it was inedible. I'm not a picky eater and I've never sent any dish back at a restaurant, so we didn't make a fuss, but we physically could not chew it.  When our waiter saw that we had hardly touched it and asked how it was, we just laughed and said it was inedible, but all he said was, ""hopefully your entrees are better.""  My boyfriend ordered the spicy cashew chicken and I ordered the chicken piccata.  My chicken was okay.  It didn't have a whole lot of flavor, and it only had 3 little capers on it (which is my favorite part!), but the spicy cashew chicken was really bad.  The rice was actually floating in the amount of sauce that the chicken was drenched in.  My boyfriend could hardly eat any of it.  To make things worse, we never once had our waters filled during the entire meal even though my boyfriend's water was empty after only about 20 minutes.  In addition, our waiter was very difficult to track down to get our checks, and then it was a good while once again before he took our payment.   The only redeeming aspect of our meal was the dessert.  We ordered the red velvet cheesecake (in which we waited quite some time to order it and then have it brought to our table), but it was delicious! I will probably opt out of ever dining here again, but I might order the cheesecake for takeout."
Arlene M.,"Pittsburgh, PA",354,768,3120,2.0,10/5/2013,"The only time I visit the Cheesecake factory is for lunch. Normally this place gets very crowded and you have to wait for a table. I love the warm brown seed bread they serve with their meals. The lunch time portions are almost as large as the dinner portions but is quite filling. You do have to pay for parking but if you park in the garage they will validate you for $2.00 off your ticket. As far as the cheesecake goes, it's fair. I have had genuine NY cheesecake that lays on my stomach. This type is ok but not what I am used to. I normally will visit when family and friends want to go there but it isn't a place I would choose for myself."
Michelle C.,"Greensburg, PA",3,56,8,5.0,2/14/2016,I only come here for happy hour from 4-6. The happy hour deals are AMAZING the burger is $5.50 and cannot be beat.  The entire happy hour menu is great and you get a lot of food.  Drink specials are reasonable.
Kristy A.,"Pittsburgh, PA",142,370,3,3.0,9/23/2014,"If you like excess, this is your place!   It got three stars because of stellar service; but overall, I just can't get behind this concept.   Let's start with the menu, which has over 100 options easy.   That's just too many.  Way too many.  It's 20 pages or so plus an insert.  It takes forever to read through, forever to decide, and I'm always wishing I'd ordered something else.    Then there are the portions.  This place is why Americans are fat.  And not even in a good way.   I ordered a barbecue ranch salad.  $14.95...fine cause it does have chicken and the menu description looked yummy.  But this salad was so ridiculously excessive that our whole table could have shared one for dinner and been full.  I ate a lot and barely made a dent...and let's be honest, dressed salad just isn't good the next day.   There is no reason to serve 8 pounds of salad.  Ever.   Cut it in half (maybe even 3rds) and charge me ten bucks.  And don't get me started on the skinnylicious menu...getting a few items to come it at under 600 calories isn't anything to brag about.    The cheesecakes are good; but again, sort of excessive.   25 options or so to choose from and no option for a smaller portion.    My fave is the dulce de leche, which is amazing.  I do love it and would go back for it, but I'd probably skip the meal.    If you decide to go to this location, David was an excellent server.   He took our large party antics in stride and offered up a great time.   He alone (and maybe the dulce cheesecake) could have rated 5 stars."
Vi L.,"Philadelphia, PA",195,208,163,2.0,9/4/2014,"The cheesecakes are good and the setting is kind of fancy smancy, but that is all. Everything went downhill from that point. The Cheesecake Factory just intensifies my dislike for restaurant chains.   Now, let me whine, cry and complain. It's way too dark in there, how the heck am I supposed to read the menu? Are there sketchy stuff in the food that you guys don't want me to see? Also, it took nearly an hour for my food to arrive. My eating companions literally left the restaurant to walk around and when they came back, I'm still there nibbling on bread and butter. The frustrating part is that the restaurant was not even that busy. I got to try the avocado eggrolls, which were so bland. The Bang-Bang Chicken and Shrimp dish, which was just a super sweet curry dish. It looks kind of gross, but tastes ok. The Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta was not even spicy at all, but was actually the most edible dish on the table.   Overall, the long wait really turned me off and the food was not that impressive. I recommend this place for the tasty cheesecakes, and ONLY the tasty cheesecakes."
Alicia M.,"Pittsburgh, PA",2,10,1,5.0,3/24/2016,"One of my favorite restaurants! I have been to this location multiple times and have never had a bad experience. The waiters are friendly and are very helpful. I like how there are many shops around it just incase you need to kill time and it is very convenient for the movie theater to be right across the street.  They have a big selection of food, desserts and drinks. And the portions are big so you get your money's worth. The only downside is that this location gets really crowded because a lot of people from the Southside, downtown and neighboring areas flock to this location. Usually, if you go to get a table anytime before 6:30 it won't be a bad/long wait."
Laura M.,"Tuscaloosa, AL",2251,596,1336,3.0,8/5/2014,"I came here last Wed. to get a 50% off slice of cheesecake, since they were running a promo for Nat'l Cheesecake Day.  I opted for takeout since I wanted to sit by the river to eat my cheesecake, and things were a bit hectic due to the promo.  I decided to try the new lemon meringue cheesecake, since I was in the mood for something on the lighter side.  Due to the crowd, it took about 5 min. for the cheesecake to come up, during which time I used the restroom (to the left of the take out counter).  Though I've never dined in in this location, the dining space was quite cavernous. When my cheesecake came up, it was served to me in a bag.  I asked the woman serving me if a fork and napkins were had been included, and she said they were.  Despite this, when I sat down and removed the contents, no napkins were in the bag.  (This wasn't a huge deal, however, since I'm not a big napkin user--on the other hand, missing the fork would have necessitated having to go back.)  When I opened the box containing the cheesecake, it was slightly squished on one side due to how it had been loaded into the bag, and some of the meringue stuck to the side of the box.  Speaking of which, the meringue application wasn't nearly as polished as it looks in the official photo, and for a cheesecake inspired by lemon meringue pie, I was expecting it to have quite a bit more volume--as it were, it was a thin, flimsy foam.  The filling, on the other hand, was quite creamy and delicious, with lots of lemony flavor.  I appreciated the garnishes of candied lemon peel on the whipped cream that comes with the cheesecake and of mint leaves, which I ate and chewed on, respectively.  Overall, despite that its visual appeal left something to be desired, I enjoyed this piece of cheesecake, esp. for $4.25, and would recommend it.  In fact, I'd be willing to award 4 stars, but for the appearance of the slice and the lack of sufficient meringue.  3.5 stars."
Jessica S.,"Pittsburgh, PA",160,9,,1.0,4/5/2016,"Let me start by saying I am usually a big fan of the Cheesecake Factory. Despite the super crowded tables, I enjoy the food and the atmosphere. The service is never great, but that is something I have come to terms with. However, the Cheesecake Factory on the South Side had particularly TERRIBLE service when I went this weekend on Sunday night.  It wasn't terribly busy, and we were seated right away (party of two). After being seated, we were not approached for an entire ten minutes. We were beginning to think they forgot about us, but were glad when the waitress came. She took our drink orders (just water) and we asked for bread, and then we didn't see her for another ten minutes at least. When she came back, she brought two waters but no bread, claiming that there wasn't any ready despite all of the tables around us receiving bread continuously from their respective waiters/waitresses. She refused to take our orders when she dropped the drinks off, so we had to wait. She came back around five-ten minutes later, and without bread again. She finally took our orders. About ten minutes after that, she came back and asked what we ordered again, because she ""was confused"" and got things mixed up. At this time, we decided to ask another waitress for bread, who brought it out within two minutes. A little bit later, our waitress came back, still claimed no bread had been made (despite us having received some, but not from her), and asked us if we had seen a credit card or any receipts lying around or under our table. She insisted we look under our table. Apparently she had lost the credit card and receipt of one of the tables she was waiting on. When the food came out, it was perfect and we were very pleased with that. Throughout the entire meal, she did not refill out waters once, she brought us no bread, and when I asked her to box my food, she never brought it back. Overall she was the worst waitress I have ever had and I cannot believe that the Cheesecake Factory has her working there. She is a disgrace to the restaurant. I will probably not return because I am so infuriated with how we were treated. We asked to speak to a manager and were told that there was not a manager present. I will likely try calling to inform them."
Laurie D.,"Pittsburgh, PA",28,82,64,5.0,12/26/2015,Service was great food delicious. Nice selection of cheesecakes. They don't take reservations so you must be at the restaurant and all the party must be there to get seated.
Samantha W.,"Charleston, WV",3,13,8,5.0,7/2/2016,"Dude, I love this place, I don't care if it's a chain. The Brioche breakfast sandwich is super delicious. We also got hot crab dip which was also very tasty. Finished with some classic strawberry cheesecake which never disappoints. My only gripe about this company is that they use canned whipped cream. Like come on, make that shit fresh or buy something better than Ready Whip."
