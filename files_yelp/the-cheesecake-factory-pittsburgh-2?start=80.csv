Meghan S.,"Pittsburgh, PA",8,29,7,5.0,9/11/2014,"I love this place. I've been eating here for years, and have been a regular customer this summer. I've tried a variety of dishes: burgers, chicken tenders, buffalo chicken blasts, chicken romano, California cheesesteak... all delicious. The only one I didn't really care for was a pasta dish. I think it was a 3 cheese pasta. The chicken romano is my favorite and I've ordered it my last few visits. All of the dishes are a little pricey (chicken romano $17), but the portions are huge. I always have enough for lunch the next day.  Drinks are delicious as well, and I think the prices are comparable to other restaurants. About $10 per specialty drink (I recommend the Sangria and the Greorgia Peach). I don't drink much beer or wine, so I'm not sure about those. Onto the cheesecake... the Hershey's cheesecake = omg. It's a chocolate lover's dream. I also like the 30th Anniversary cheesecake. And I've tried both of the peanut butter cheesecakes, the Oreo cheesecake, and the turtle cheesecake. All good, but not enough chocolate for me! Cheesecake is about $8 a slice. (Tip: take-out slices are smaller. So order a slice to eat there, and then box it up if you can't finish. Yeahhh maybe I'm greedy, but if I'm spending $8 on a slice, I want my money's worth!) Overall, I spend about $50 each visit. I'd say that service is pretty good here. This goes for all restaurants, people: if it's busy, service might be a little slower. That's the risk you take when you go out on a Saturday night. But I've been here multiple times and I can't say that the service has ever been terrible. I agree with other reviews about the din. It can be hard to converse when it's busy. And they're right that the lighting is dim. But, like the Melting Pot, I think that's all part of the ambience. There is outdoor seating in the summer, and I'm all about outdoor seating. But this summer, there have been bands playing in front of the restaurant, and the music was so loud that we couldn't converse. This is my one and only gripe with this restaurant. I'm guessing that the bands are booked by South Side Works or something and has nothing to do with the Cheesecake Factory. But I wish they'd stop! Other than that, I'm a big fan of this place."
Tamara W.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,9,4,1.0,12/26/2016,"If I could give this Cheesecake Factory zero stars I would!  First the server loses our order, she said she can't read her own handwriting and has to retake our order.  The 2 appetizers we ordered took 45 minutes to come out.  I ordered an Apple martini, the server said they couldn't make one even though the bar looked to have every type of alcohol there is. So I ordered a margarita, it took so long to come out I  never ordered another one. The women's bathroom had a long line, so they had no TP in some of the stalls, no paper towels and the trash cans were overflowing with paper towels all over the floor.  We finally got our food, it was lukewarm, we didn't complain because we wanted to get out of there.  The server brings us our check and we noticed we were charged twice for one of our appetizers so she had to adjust our bill.  I'm.from Las Vegas, I'm in Pittsburgh visiting my fiance's family.  This CF reminds me of the tourist one at the Premium Outlet Mall that remains so busy the employees no longer give a damn about service."
Nicol A.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,25,,4.0,7/23/2016,"This cheesecake factory is so much better than the one at RossPark Mall.  The bar service is great, get a Long Island or Asian Pear Martini. My mom had a blackberry (? ) Mojito?? and it was fabulous according to her. I order off the Skinny Girl menu and my food is filling and well portioned. My favorite is the shrimp and angel hair pasta. Yum!  I never have room for cheese cake after- so we order some to take home! It is a bit expensive, but worth it. The Godiva chocolate is phenom, so was the cookie dough slice.  Our servers have always been nice and accomodating, with good recommendations and give you plenty of space to check out the extensive menu. ( for real, the menu is huge). You are also served a bread basket while you wait to munch on appetizers.  The ONLY thing that stops me from 5 stars, is that I have been there when the wait takes forever for food, or once my party of 5 placed orders at once and one order did not come for minutes after the rest of ours came.  Overall, a fun place with options for even the most picky of eaters. And the cheesecake? You cant go wrong!"
Talon K.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,45,49,5.0,11/29/2016,"We've been going to the Cheesecake Factory for years,  long before they came to Pittsburgh.  No matter if it were Las Vegas, San Francisco, Seattle, Baltimore, etc., we've yet to have either a bad meal or unsatisfactory service.  The only thing that's difficult about eating here is making a menu selection as there are toooo many options!"
Julie S.,"Greensburg, PA",0,10,,5.0,1/6/2017,Love it!  Always taste so good.  Please put more in the Pittsburgh area preferably Greensburg :)
Chris M.,"Bloomingdale, IL",208,209,356,5.0,8/19/2014,"Dinner on a Thursday night on a business trip. We were across the street the night before for German food and I saw The Cheesecake Factory!  Couldn't wait.  Sat down in a booth by the bar, watching the Chicago Bears Pre-Season game, drinking a Sam Adams Octoberfest in mid August. Our waitress was awesome; instead of ordering my favorite dish, Spicy Cashew Chicken I tried the Chicken Katsu. It's crispy fried over rice and spicy miso sauce, different but good. My co worker went with the spicy cashew chicken!  For dessert we both ordered the 30th Anniversary cheesecake. Definitely my top 5!"
Jason Z.,"Pittsburgh, PA",21,91,162,4.0,4/25/2016,Great place for... Cheesecake and their mixed drinks are good too. Atmosphere is amazing and service is excellent as well.
Mariah P.,"Noblestown, PA",166,19,10,5.0,8/24/2015,I can honestly say I have never had a bad meal/experience here! I'm a creature of habit so I  usually order the same thing except here I tend to try new dishes!! The food is ALWAYS amazing and the service is up to par every single time. I've never spoken to a manager there and I see that as a good thing!! My aunt and I got the chicken nachos as an appetizer (which could feed a family of 6) and I got the Avacado chicken sandwich on rye with mozzarella which was to die for!! Not to mention I somehow found a way to get desert. I finished with a Reese's cup cheesecake which was incredible!! Already dreaming of the next time we ~
Valerie C.,"Pittsburgh, PA",6,6,2,5.0,5/16/2015,"I cook for my husband almost every day. I do like to cook but when the process becomes a routine I need to take a break and go out some fine restaurant. The Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite food-places. I am dying to know the recipe of an appetizer ""Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes"". It is incredibly delicious. Sometimes I just get this dish and cheesecake on the dessert and I`m full.  This place is really busy on weekends. You should be able to wait a twenty or thirty minutes but it is worth it. The waiter stuff is very friendly and they are serving very fast.  I have never been dissapointed with the Cheesecake Factory and highly recommend this place:)"
Jessica H.,"Pittsburgh, PA",75,18,11,4.0,6/6/2015,"For as huge this place is, and the fact that it's usually packed beyond belief, they do a damn good job! I usually end up going in pretty late, but they never make us feel rushed or like we're keeping them there late. Whether I sit at the bar or we grab a booth, service is pretty quick and friendly! My favorite drink is the Strawberry Creamsicle that comes with a fresh strawberry on top [the menu doesn't tell you, but it has whipped cream on top too]. I still eat like I'm 5, so it's always nachos or chicken for me and occasionally steak. The food can be hit or miss, honestly. I've gotten some pretty dry chicken and once my friend sent back 2 different dishes. I really don't prefer to send things back, but I on one occasion I did send back my mid-rare steak that came out so well done that it was hard for me to chew (nbd). The manger comped it for me and was sincerely super nice! If you read my other reviews you'll notice that I prefer the divey, down-home types of places. For being a chain, I really do like Cheesecake!"
James M.,"Bridgeville, PA",0,7,,5.0,7/24/2015,"The Cheesecake Factory is home to my favorite dish of all time, the crispy chicken costoletta.  It is so good I can't even put it in words and for that alone it gets the 5 star rating. The service has never been terrible and the drinks are pretty good too.   Can't wait to see you again, Cheesecake Factory."
Angela F.,"Pittsburgh, PA",19,71,10,3.0,1/6/2016,"Holy menus Batman!! For those of you that have never tried the Cheesecake Factory, their menu is.....extensive. It's my personal belief that if your menu needs page numbers, you have too many things on the menu, but what do I know? The thing about CF is you have to remember their thing is cheesecake and they do that well. It's hard for me to say they do it any better than that, because really, I don't like cake, even ones made of cheese. As for the food, they have a ton of options and they are consistent. If you find something there you love, more than likely you will love it every time.  Like I usually get a pizza or this chicken BBQ salad which rocks! But is HUGE!  Because we had stopped by before going to the movies, we were eating rather light. Two of us got the pizza and salad lunch for about $13.00, which was really reasonable considering the pizza is a decent size, AND you get to choose from any pizza toppings you want; I chose the chicken BBQ. Mmmmmm! The salad was literally just greens and a couple tomato quarters...not as Mmmmmmm. The BF got the lunch size meatloaf, which was not really to his/our liking. It comes smothered in gravy and onions, and I am an anti-onion person. Everyone got desert- cheesecake, of course- and the best by far was the salted caramel. Coming in a close second was the raspberry lemon, which was very refreshing and, because it has a cake layer (or something, I can't really remember) it is one of the least bad for you, calorically speaking. The Hershey's chocolate was a dud. Just really chocolatey without any charm or pizazz.  My parting advice would be to check out the menu on line BEFORE going, to narrow down you options, so you don't go into menu shock when you get there (seriously, it's like 14 pages)."
DJ J.,"Pittsburgh, PA",1512,869,407,3.0,10/27/2014,"Have had the cheesecake but never been to the restaurant.  I knew the place as large and was wondering about the service.  Well the service was good.  They seem to use expeditors to deliver food, so it came out hot.  My Cuban sandwich was good.  It had the usual pork, ham, cheese and tasty pickle.  Had the sweet potato fries as the side that were your standard but good sweet potato fries. The SkinnyLisious menu had some interesting choices.  The Shrimp taco looked good, and the person that ordered it, was not about to share.  They received a really nice vegetable salad that had a somewhat sweet flavored dressing that was really tasty."
Rocco P.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,4,,1.0,10/23/2016,Worst customer service of all time. Would not try. Waited 3 times on the phone to place takeout order for over 5-7 minutes each time asked to speak to a manager and they couldn't even find one to speak with for another 5 minutes. Poorly ran place. For basic food not worth the wait or pain in the butt to deal with that service.
BJ B.,"Pittsburgh, PA",169,76,104,5.0,9/24/2014,I have not been disappointed with this restaurant.  The quality of food and alcoholic drinks are always top notch.  I ordered the blended Georgia Peach and for my appetizer I got fried zucchini.  Zucchini is one of my favorite vegetables.  I ordered the lunch portion of the Pasta Da Vinci. Another delectable dish. I try not to order the same dish twice.  The only thing I didn't do that I normally do when I attend the restaurant is order CHEESECAKE!!! I shall return for my slice!
Burghers And F.,"Coraopolis, PA",0,5,11,5.0,10/8/2016,"Tonight we ventured into the Cheesecake Factory for a dessert and cappuccino.  We have frequented this location many times and like so many times before, this experience was great.  The low-carb cheesecake and pumpkin cheesecake was perfect.  The server was nice and prompt.  We could not ask for anything better.  Thank you Cheesecake Factory for providing us dessert which was by far the best thing we had eaten all day!"
Brian M.,"Pittsburgh, PA",137,8,,4.0,4/7/2016,"Awesome place for Sunday brunch! We have gone several Sunday's now, and have never had to wait more than five minutes to be seated each visit. The brunch offerings are plentiful (as are the portions!). The breakfast potatoes are consistently crispy and taste excellent. The lemon ricotta pancakes are to die for! Plus, remember to have your parking slip validated by the front desk (always nice when you can't find on-street parking). My only complaint is that sometimes the noise level makes table conversations a bit difficult to understand (but, that is to be expected given the high ceilings in the restaurant). Otherwise, great place!"
Xinyu H.,"Pittsburgh, PA",11,71,26,3.0,4/5/2015,"Well, let's talk about the cheese cakes first. They are not as good as you might expect, good enough to brand this chain restaurants. We tried three and they are all over sweetened.  Food, average but relatively affordable."
Liz J.,"Pittsburgh, PA",14,14,18,3.0,9/28/2014,"Came here for dessert. Sat outside on a beautiful September evening. My friend and I didn't feel like drinking so we split the AMAZING chocolate chip cookie dough cheesecake al a mode. Holy smokes was it good. Even though we just split one cheesecake slice, our waiter was so attentive and fun. I know I'd be annoyed if we showed up and just split one dessert as a waitress!! Always a fun place, little over priced for meals, but a fun atmosphere. Fun with a group!"
Taylor F.,"Pittsburgh, PA",123,245,177,1.0,5/12/2013,"AVOID!! AVOID!! AVOID!! I have always enjoyed The Cheesecake Factory chain and have dined at several of their establishments along the East Coast.  Sadly, my experience at this particular establishment was by far the worst in my life. My family had planned for weeks on eating at the Cheesecake Factory in South Side for my brothers college graduation dinner.  We called ahead and were told you could not make reservations.   Upon our arrival there were only a few groups waiting.  We were told it would be a 40 minute wait.  This was expected since we had a party of 8.  However, while waiting we noticed some groups seemed to have special treatment and had been allowed to make reservations.  We checked on the wait several times and were continuously told we were next.  They even went as far as to tell they were pushing tables together.  We watched as party after party who had arrived after us were seated.  Even large parties of 20, 12, and 9.   After an hour it was clear something was wrong.  My brother, who was supposed to be celebrating his graduation, questioned the hostess on the protocol of seating customers.  She assured we were next and that it was first come first serve.  He pointed out that everyone who had arrived after us has been given tables.  She said he was wrong and that we would be next.  2 minutes later she seated a party of 9 before us. After waiting an hour and never being given a table.  Our entire party walked out unfed and angry.  It's a shame that loyal paying customers would be treated that way. Grab a slice of cheesecake to go and head elsewhere for dinner."
