Peter T.,"Syracuse, NY",1,59,,4.0,11/30/2017,"11//27/17 We've been to this Cheesecake Factory before. The meals were usually good to very good. An occasional fail.  This time 2 were excellent. The Eggplant Parmesan and the Pasta Napoletana. The Orange Chicken was ""ok."" It was describes as ""Chicken Tenders covered with some kinda orange sauce"". Not spicy.   The service was excellent. EGGPLANT PARMESAN Eggplant Lightly Coated with Parmesan Breadcrumbs and Cooked Crisp. Covered with Mozzarella Cheese, Fontina Cheese and Marinara Sauce. Served with Pesto Pasta.   ORANGE CHICKEN Deep Fried Pieces of Chicken Breast Covered in a Sweet and Spicy Orange Sauce. Served with White Rice and Vegetables. PASTA NAPOLETANA Italian Sausage, Pepperoni, Housemade Meatball, Mushrooms, Peppers, Bacon, Onions and Garlic in a Rich Tomato Sauce. Served Over Parmesan Cream Pasta. More sauce would help elevate the dish.   The bread very good! We purchased 2 to go."
Eric Z.,"Rochester, NY",13,3,,1.0,1/3/2018,"My friend is vegetarian and she found pepperoni in her meal that was on the menu as vegatarian. They remade the food, but it took 30 more minutes to receive fixed. It was almost as if instead of going back to the front of the line, they had it behind the other hundred people's orders. We talked to the manager about the wait and she was very rude. We were there for a little bit less than 3 hours. -_- My girl friends birthday dinner for 5 turned into a bad night. ),:"
Sun B.,"Cupertino, CA",0,36,,2.0,8/14/2017,"I had to knock off 2 stars for what happened after the meal. Read on Had Eggplant Parmesan, Spicy Chipotle Chicken, Spicy Cashew nut chicken and Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp & Chicken. Portions were huge for everything. The Eggplant had 3 huge pieces which my friend said was not up to the status of Olive Garden. So I guess bad? The cashew nut chicken was good but more sweet than spicy with a tangy sauce and brown rice. Chipotle chicken was slightly spicy but good with crispy pasta. The Jamaican shrimp was not that spicy either but my friends liked it. Also had fried sweet plantains which went will with the shrimp.  The service was good and fast during the meal.  But we ordered 2 slices of cheesecake to go. When we got home we found that the cheesecake was missing. On going back the next day the manager had us find the receipt and then gave us the slices. She did not bother to even apologize for the mistake. At this point my friend asked her to replace one of the choices with a different on of the same price. The manager said no saying that she had to meet inventory (no idea what that meant since obviously had not noticed 2 extra slices the night before ). On further insistence she finally gave in. I did not expect such resistance when we had to drive twice to get our food."
Andrew P.,"Rochester, NY",231,146,336,4.0,7/14/2017,"This is a nice restaurant that I've been a patron for years. The staff is always friendly and the food is decent. It's admirable (and disheartening to my diet) that all the items on the menu displays the calorie amount! It doesn't stop me from ordering an entree, but there's so much food that I only eat a half portion. The textbook of a menu boasts a diverse selection of food, but the items I usually come for are: Chicken Carbonara: Huge portion, very cheesey and smooth sauce, perfect amount of grilled chicken to accommodate the pasta and peas. Buffalo wings: I'm a big fan at how crispy the wings are despite being doused with a copious amount of hot sauce, and the size and amount of wings can pretty much stand in as a meal! Cheesecake: Need I say more? They presentation and taste of them are unrivaled. TREAT YO SELF!"
Jessica R.,"New York, NY",577,92,113,2.0,5/23/2017,"Came back here again for dinner.  Order: Thai lettuce wraps, chicken tomato pasta and beef tacos.  Beef tacos and chicken pasta was great!  Highly recommend the beef tacos. Customer service was terrible. We couldn't even remember who our server was, we probably saw her only once. We felt almost neglected by the service.  Our order took almost an hour and a half to be brought out, a manager came to our table to apologize for the kitchen delay."
Sara W.,"Webster, NY",64,65,41,4.0,4/18/2017,"We visited last night and had some really great service by Brittany. She was attentive but didn't hover. She made sure to (fully) stop at our table and offer drink refills, cracked pepper/ parmesan and even filled us in when she went on her break. Managers- she deserves a gold star for her service,.  Food was good- took a little while to come out but it was dinner hours. Everything tasted good and came out hot."
Patricia B.,"East Rochester, NY",4,33,7,5.0,10/16/2017,I was out shopping at the pittsford plaza- did not realize it was past lunch time. Greeted nicely and got a table near the bar area. It was quite lively as students were off from college. Two senior ladies sat next to me and spoke very low. Enjoyed a glass of prosecco infused with fruit picked me up from having an eye exam & quick trip to TJ MAXX. Wow needed to relax had a slim size chicken slider with a side salad. Warm bread and a sweet smile from my server. Finished up and headed home to check in on my pup. Very pleasant experience!
Troy H.,"Rochester, NY",57,291,536,4.0,8/18/2016,"Ive been a fan on and off of CF for at least 15 years; at this one Ive had more good meals than bad. The last time I had the chicken di pana which tasted almost too good..don't want to know how much butter was in it. Mashed potatoes here also always seem to be done well. Linda's fudge cake is my fav for dessert. One star deducted because of the long hair I found on top of the food in my to go container when I opened it up the next day. From now on, I will be boxing my own food at the table =("
Chas I.,"Pittsford, NY",69,15,,5.0,12/19/2017,You just can't go wrong as their food is consistently good. The menu is so huge you can make anyone happy. We go quite often for lunch and their staff is amazing....especially at the bar.
John M.,"Rochester, NY",19,140,221,3.0,2/9/2017,"I end up leaving underwhelmed every time I come here. The atmosphere and decor puts off an aura that you're going to be impressed and that you're gonna get a great meal - but nothing is ever ""great"", except the cheesecake.  The menu is too big. I love choices, but there's too many (at least for me). Normally, such a large menu means that food quality suffers because the kitchen is unable to focus on a few good things and make them great. I won't say the food is bad quality here, but for the feel of the place and the price you pay, it's just not that good. It's not the quality you'd expect.  The cheesecake is always good. They have all kinds, and I've always liked each one I've had. They bring bread out to your table when your seated, 2 different kinds, both really good. Service and interactions with employees are always great as well."
Brent A.,"Rochester, NY",125,173,26,3.0,1/4/2017,"What is there to say about the Cheesecake Factory? You know when you get to a restaurant, look at the menu, and can't decide what to get because nothing really pops out but there's a billion things you could see yourself eating because the menu is so big? That's the Cheesecake factory and they're really good at highlighting your indecisive tendencies.  Gigantic menu, large portions, interesting drinks. It's a chain so there's really no variation. We went there are a group for lunch and it wasn't too bad. I feel strange ordering what I see as a dinner dish for lunch, so I went with a Cuban. It was pretty good, the bread being the star of the sandwich... it was the best part.  But let's be honest, you go to the cheesecake factory for the cheesecake. There are tons of different varieties, from plain cheesecake to the triple chocolate fudge extravaganza. I'm not sure if the last cheesecake is actually a type, but I'm sure I'm not far off. The wait can be long to get a table but is it worth the wait? Eh? Maybe not my first choice."
Marilynne L.,"Rochester, NY",153,67,81,3.0,7/15/2017,"Love the diversity of menu offerings.  We enjoy frequent visits and have been very happy with service and quality except for this last recent visit. Wait staff are normally cheerful and helpful.  Today's server seemed like he'd rather have been anywhere but at our table.  Not sure why because we tend not to be too annoying.  One of us ordered a salad that had more dead lettuce than it should have given this season of fresh produce. Still, we enjoy this place and hope the experience was just an off day."
Zack R.,"Rochester, NY",159,93,63,4.0,2/21/2017,"I really like The Cheesecake Factory, the menu is massive and you can't beat that cheesecake! I went to the Pittsford Plaza location (great location to stop into if you're out shopping) Saturday with family and was surprised at the sheer size, It looks big on the outside and even bigger on the inside. We went at about 4 p.m. and got in and seated immediately. We had bread brought to the table and the staff was really great and clearly well-trained.   I ordered one of the new specialties which was the Chicken Parmesan ""Pizza Style."" It was so good and such a huge portion for an affordable price. It was basically breaded chicken flattened to be the size of a large plate and cooked with sauce and mozzarella on top. It is then topped off with a mound of garlic parmesan spaghetti. We also ordered the Crispy Cuban Rolls, which were essentially Cuban sandwiches in egg roll form. Very tasteful!  The menu is nice because there's something for everyone and there are so many choices. I need to go more often to try these options, not to mention the page and a half of cheesecake choices. The Cheesecake Factory is a consistently safe bet, and this is a wonderful location."
Laura S.,"Pittsford, NY",80,50,17,2.0,7/28/2017,Just sadly slow service.  We are literally sitting along on the patio waiting for our check.  Thanks for the slice of cheese cake but come on!
Tom M.,"Fairport, NY",26,80,611,2.0,7/4/2017,"This is the type review I really don't want to have to give. The five of us stopped after the movie for an early dinner and Roy's obligatory Cheesecake. Everything started our fine, then the food arrived. Apps we're good - Cuban Rolls and a fried pocket thing Erin ordered Meals: My ""appetizer mixed Veggies Salad was good, Roy liked his Margherita Pizza, Connie's was good, most of Gail's was good - discovered some rubbery chicken towards the end of the meal. Erin's salmon was a different story. The carrots had a slight spice heat she couldn't do - no harm, no foul, the waitress swapped out for rice and replated.  The pile of rice could have fed three or four. After serving the swap she never stopped or slowed near our table again. We finally had to ask another server for her. The salmon was way over cooked and the Broccoli soggy. We were willing to see if some teryaki sauce would have made less dry but by the time we finally got her to the table again it was ice. We told waitress about meal, asked for the manager. He took off the bill but we had to ask to SEE him twice. When he came he apologized perfunctly, said he took off the bill. When we explained about the MIA waitress he copped to them being busy - they had steady business but no stopping by for over 1/2 hour - no. That excuse doesn't cut it. I told him we both had experience in retail and I in restaurant service. Some things we talk to waitress about, others we ask for the manager.  He was perfunctory, but just wanted us gone. It's not the first time some of the food has been so-so. Most of the time staff is decent. Even with Roy wanting his beloved Cheesecake it will be a long time for a re-visit. You can read my reviews and see how many fall below three stars. You have to be *exceptional* to get two stars."
Lynn S.,"Rochester, NY",58,118,188,4.0,12/23/2016,"The two times I have been here, I have enjoyed their food. I came here once for my birthday and one more recently for appetizers and their cheesecake obviously. Though service was a bit slow, it didn't take away from my experience. Favourite cheesecakes are the chocolate tuxedo cheesecake, the Godiva flourless chocolate cheesecake and the Kaluha cream cheesecake."
Maria F.,"Rochester, NY",110,76,40,5.0,5/6/2017,Love this place! Their chicken tacos are to die for along with their homemade veggie burger! They have a huge menu so there is so much to choose from! Not to mention their cheesecake selection which is a must when coming here!
Josh M.,"Manhattan, NY",541,532,2448,4.0,1/19/2016,I'm a big fan of the cheesecake factory.  The cheesecake factory is still a chain but the ambience inside makes it feel a little bit more upscale. Great place to eat for business or a date.  There aren't any cheesecake factory locations in New York City. So every chance To eat a a cheesecake factory I try to go. I have been to a few locations in White Plains and in Newark. I had to stop through Pittsford for a meeting for work and I noticed that they had a cheesecake factory in town. Right next-door was an Applebee's. I looked at the Applebee's then I looked at the cheesecake factory and it's a no-brainer the cheesecake factory is the winner.  Most of the food served at the cheesecake factory is Italian style. They do have other types of cuisine on the menu. I recommend asking about the specials. Every day there are new specials that the cheesecake factory offers. The day that I went to the soup of the day was the corn chowder. I'm not really a big fan of corn chowder but I figured I would try some. The soup was absolutely delicious I could've just had the soup for lunch. I ended up getting a flat bread. The flat bread was very good. You could really taste how fresh the ingredients were. Simple and fresh is the best.  The person that Was joining me had the southwestern salad with grilled chicken. The salad was so big that two people could have shared it and still had leftovers. You could come here to eat for lunch or you could definitely take a date here. Setting is a little bit more moody.  Our waiter was extremely knowledgeable of the menu he did not have to write anything down he knew the menu front for back as well as the wine list. I was extremely impressed by his knowledge and how he handled himself as our waiter. I was so impressed that I told him I eat out a lot a very expensive restaurants and sometimes I don't even get that kind of a service at a very expensive restaurant that cost $80-$100 per person. I cannot remember his name but if you do read this review I am extremely impressed by your energy enthusiasm and knowledge of the menu.  Overall the cheesecake factory is definitely one of my favorite chains out there. If I'm in any city and there's a cheesecake factory I will definitely eat there. I highly recommend eating at any of the cheesecake factories.  PROS: - ambience is great.  -our waiter was knowledgeable and enthusiastic -food is simple and taste great
Jennifer O.,"Greece, NY",78,148,1615,4.0,6/15/2016,"It's always FREEZING inside here. It is unnecessary.   The menu is overwhelming. They have 2 of them. A ""skinny"" menu and a regular menu. There are so many, too many options that if you go there for the first time you'll be spending a lot of time looking at the menu! BUT, the food I've had here is extremely delicious.  I'm actually glad Cheesecake Factory is on the other side of town or I would frequent  it more. I am Head Over Heels for their thai lettuce wraps.  They have two kinds of lettuce wraps so make sure you get the make your own. YOU HAVE TO TRY THEM. They come with carrots, cucumbers, rice noodles , marinated chicken, cilantro, bean sprouts and huge lettuce cups. I've had lettuce wraps at many other places and nothing compares. The best part about these wraps is that it comes with three sauces that are the best things on the planet. They are a Tamarind cashew sauce , peanut sauce and a sweet chili sauce. My words cannot give this dish  any justice, you need to try them for yourself. The spring rolls are also excellent.  They wrap them to order. It comes with the sweet chili sauce and maybe even the peanut sauce The bang bang shrimp that comes with rice and veggies is spectacular. It could use a little more heat to it but otherwise I definitely recommend.  I don't like the coldness of the restaurant and I don't like that they only have one soup which is the soup of the day. Their menu is humongous but they only serve one soup?"
Mel B.,"Rochester, NY",92,100,1266,4.0,11/21/2015,"Enjoying the experience at the Cheesecake Factory takes knowing what to order. The location in Pittsford is somewhat intimidating because of the high traffic in the parking lot and the long wait after 6 p.m. on a weekend night (and yes, I get that it is a chain). Yet, the lengthy menu boasts some menu options that are unique in their own right, and you can customize them to make them more of your own. I recommend to anyone to start with the Green Iced Tea (it's minty!) and the Corn Cake Tamales. They are colorful, California meets Tex-Mex, and fun to eat for $10. The ""appetizer"" comes with three large corn cakes, topped with sour cream, pico de gallo, avocado, and surrounded with tomatillo sauce. There are cute corn husk tails sticking out from either end. Say what you will, but I am excited every time I get this dish. My tip is to ask for grilled chicken on top ($3 extra) and to make it a meal.  I also recommend the Thai Chicken Lettuce Wraps for the exciting plating (walls of green lettuce and purple cabbage) and color of the dish. The grilled chicken and vegetables are fresher in quality, and make you feel better that you are going to cap off the experience with a cheesecake. My go-to cheesecake is the Vanilla bean cheesecake. It sounds boring, but the tartness of the cheesecake is cut by the smoothness of the vanilla bean and graham cracker crust! So delicious! I made Naz B. come with me recently, and she tried the Godiva chocolate cheesecake. We both agreed that it could have used a raspberry sauce. It is pretty rich with chocolate flavor and pretty divine if you have a craving for the cocoa bean, rather than the vanilla.  The atmosphere here is Las Vegas Egyptian Room meets the Palm Room at the Plaza. The high ceilings and forced grandness is somewhat undercut by the tvs playing sports near the bar and the busy rows of tables lining the place. Try to get a dark wood paneled booth if you can. It gives you a sense of intimacy among the loud chatter, and you don't have to share elbow space with your fellow diners.  I like coming to this place for lunch or dinner. The lunch hour during the week is pretty chill, and the big windows let in lots of light. It makes me feel like I am in a big city when I visit, and the excitement for my corn cakes makes it worth a trip every few months."
Jason A.,"Monroe County, NY",18,73,6,3.0,4/6/2017,I'm usually not much for corporate food or chain restaurants but I do go to a few on occasion. I've been to this location several times. Food is consistently good. I do like that they can make the same dish the same way every time so you know what you're getting.  It's typically busy here though they have a lot of tables and it's not difficult to get a seat. A lot of the seats are tables with chairs on one side and a long booth down the other. Best bet is to request a full booth so that you're not dining with others unless that's your thing. I'll be back for sure and highly recommend the mac and cheese balls. They also have a burger with a mac and cheese ball topping and it's quite good. The selection of cheesecake is of course hard to compete with and it's worth just stopping in for dessert.
Fred D.,"Brooklyn, NY",12,53,13,5.0,3/29/2017,6 stars. I came here with a party of 6 and no one at the table was disappointed.  Service: Great service. I didn't have to flag down the waitress and she checked on my table on a consistent basis. She also refilled my water glass every time it went low.  Food: BOMB! I ordered the chicken and shrimp gumbo and fell in love. I know have to go home to try to replicate this meal. Everyone in my party also enjoyed their meal.
Hunter E.,"Rochester, NY",0,2,4,1.0,12/28/2016,"I wish I could say that I enjoyed my experience at the Cheesecake Factory; unfortunately, this is not the case...  I arrived with my significant other for dinner and the entire restaurant was empty so we wrongfully assumed that we would be in and out within about an hour. We were seated by a very friendly hostess and then the waiting game began... we waited for twenty minutes before our server came over to us to even start with drink orders.  From there, we had to fight to get bread at the table by reminding our waitress repeatedly of our need. Then we ordered our entrees...and waited...and waited... Finally, the waitress came over and confirmed the order with us, claiming that there was a computer problem for the past half-an-hour so she was unable to ring in the order. We felt like she had completely forgotten about us and that she didn't even ring in the order in the first place. We were really looking forward to the food so we were glad to wait a little longer.  While we waited, a busser came over to clear the table next to ours. In the process of doing so, he knocked over a glass, which completely drenched my right leg in whatever liquid was in the glass. No apology, just an, ""oops,"" was all I got. Fine... the food would make up for it. The food was repulsive. My shrimp scampi was cold, bland, and the noodles were an overcooked mush while my shrimps were as hard as rubber!  Needless to say, with the terrible service, a drenched leg, and two and a half hours wasted, we will not be returning."
Yen N.,"Rochester, NY",6,14,11,5.0,2/28/2017,Always a go to place for me when i don't know what i want to eat. It's got a lot of selections to choose from and always cooked well. I was here for happy hour for the first time on Monday. Prices are great which were such a plus. I would definitely try to make it to happy hour again.
Mary P.,"Rochester, NY",74,85,359,3.0,2/13/2017,"I don't come here often, and this was my first time in the Rochester location.  I mean - let's face it:  it's a chain and it is what it is.  I can't say I was overly impressed or under-impressed.  My husband and I went with our three kids.  They did have a good kids menu, but their menu itself has so many choices, and there really is such a thing as too many choices. We were there for a late lunch and I got a Chinese Chicken Salad.  It was decent.  Nothing to write home about.  I feel kinda weird saying this, but the decor is extremely distracting.  If we didn't have a giftcard we never would have gone out of our way to come here. I would give 2.5 stars if it was an option. Oh, and we didn't get any cheesecake!"
Maria C.,"Raleigh, NC",221,160,697,3.0,5/10/2015,"The main reason I'm giving 3 stars is for the drinks and customer service, so I'll start there. I had a passion fruit Mojito and OMG it was soooooo delicious. It was the perfect drink to have while sitting outside on a hot spring afternoon. I'd do it again100 times over. The wait staff is very friendly. They're always all smiles and make sure you are happy at all times. So here was the downfall on my last visit to the Cheesecake Factory. I ordered the fish tacos. It was actually pretty delicious. It came with a side of rice and black beans in a bowl. As I was stirring both together, I found 1/2 of a blue rubber band in it. I was disgusted. The waitress was very embarrassed and I actually felt bad for her. I'm sure more disgusting things have been found in food but I'm not sure I'll ever forget this.  With that being said, I'll definitely return for drinks but it's going to stop there."
James L.,"Rochester, NY",0,8,,5.0,6/19/2017,"I took a teen, a tween, a toddler, a baby, and their parents to dinner on Thursday for an annual end of school celebration.  I must say it was great fun.  The staff were very solicitous of our needs(the baby is only 6 weeks) and offered several options for seating.  Drink orders taken quickly, bread brought and replaced twice, orders put in and then the thunderstorm hit.  Then the lights flickered and the computer faltered..amazing how a very busy restaurant can go dead silent in a heartbeat.  Lights came back quickly but had caused some minor problems in the kitchen.  The wait staff then managers came to tables apologise for delay a and let us know where we were in the queue.  Meals were done perfectly and were obviously right from the stove.  Dessert were of course obligatory and were well enjoyed.  All in all a really satisfying evening and I'm a real grouch!"
Maribelle N.,"Melbourne, FL",0,19,,3.0,7/17/2017,"Went last night.. food was very good, drinks were a little pricey (almost $12 for a cosmo) but good. Our server was wonderful, friendly and efficient. Only disappointment (and it's a big one) was the Cheesecake. We got slices to go, since we were stuffed from appetizers and dinner. If I had eaten it there, I probably would have sent it back. The crust was soggy, the caramel was thick and old... it's like the cake was beyond fresh date but sold instead of tossing out. Same thing with my husbands slice. IF we go back I will likely ask not necessarily for my favorite kind, but the freshest one at that time."
Sarah D.,"Rochester, NY",0,10,,4.0,7/1/2017,this we had reservations for 16 and they accommodated very well I think with how large our party was. They even gave us all separate checks. They're was one snafu but was rectify. This the second time eating there and both times eaten the Cobb salad with ranch dressing and it is totally legit.
Amy L.,"Rochester, NY",85,298,1009,3.0,3/24/2015,"It's always clean and so pretty in this restaurant. Huge menu, large portions but some items are really over priced. First off I love that they have Coke Zero - me and my husband have mild addictions. The bread this time wasn't warm and the butter was rock hard - makes it interesting - although I really like their whole grain bread. I got the Imperial chicken and shrimp which was super tasty and like that I could get brown rice instead of white. A little deceiving in that it was 85% chicken and maybe 2 pieces of shrimp - but had a great crunch even in the Asian sauce and nice bright chunks of ginger. My husband got the Romano crusted chicken which was described a ""light tomato sauce"" which was actually a tomato sauce made with heavy cream - tasted good though.  My husband got the S'mores cheesecake with toasted marshmallow topping and it was soooo good! I got the Reese PB Cup Chocolate cake cheesecake and it was okay but the cake portion was dry and it had peanuts in it (I didn't remember seeing that in the description) - which I wasn't a fan of - made for some odd textures with the cheesecake. We only were able to eat a couple bites of the cheesecake - so they are in the fridge. You guys gotta try that S'mores cheesecake! Service was friendly but very slow."
Jon B.,"Rochester, NY",8,123,48,3.0,11/5/2016,"Stopped in with some friends on Saturday night and was fortunate to get a booth. It is normally busy and the cafe style seating (which I hate) is no fun as the restaurant is loud especially when you're seated in such close proximity to strangers. Service was great, which is usual, the food is pretty good, a little pricey but you do get what you pay for. I have been several times to this restaurant, it's a chain, but the only one in Rochester and because the food & service is good, I tend to go back. I usually get a cheesecake to go as they have a ton of different varieties and I like to try something different. So if you're looking for good food, a bit pricey, good service and a loud restaurant give the Cheesecake Factory a try."
Larry B.,"Dansville, NY",0,5,,5.0,2/19/2017,Amazing place to eat. My wife picked to come here for our late Valentine's day lunch. I figured it was going to be some crappy restaurant that served cheesecake and God awful food. Boy was I wrong. I started out ordering the southern fried chicken sliders as our appetizer. They were amazing and huge. Next I ordered the club which is a turkey club. Also amazing. My wife ordered the smokehouse bbq burger and that was to die for.  She had cheesecake for dessert which she enjoyed. I highly recommend the cheesecake factory.....
Mohammad D.,"Rochester, NY",0,3,5,1.0,6/18/2016,"To start, this is a review on two ""Specialties Entree"" ordered at this particular Cheesecake Factory. My friend got the Baja Chicken Tacos $14.50, which was flat out flavorless and worse dry. Honestly, Taco Bell has better tacos than these and they do not take 20+ minutes. What a disappoint. I personally had the Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp for $19.50. Where do I start on this flavorless overpriced dish... Well, for starters the rice was not cooked correctly AKA literally got crunchy rice. The sauce was flavorless to the point where I could have dipped my ""black pepper"" shrimp in water and it would have tasted the same.  In short and a warning to others, the food should not be below mediocre when one has to pay close to $20 a dish. The only redeeming part was the cheesecake."
Ed L.,"West Covina, CA",0,29,4,1.0,5/15/2016,"Someone wrote ""Amazing service""?? Amazing in what way? Amazingly bad? I love Cheesecake Factory everywhere else, Los Angeles, New York City, Chicago, Ohio. I grew up in Pittsford so I was pleased to see one had opened here in my hometown.  APPALLING TELEPHONE SERVICE I brought my 92 year old father (handicapped plaque) so I called ahead to ask (just ask) whether they accept call ahead seating for elderly/handicapped customers. It was just for us two.  Jessica repeated many times that she can't do anything and we would wait 10-15 minutes for a table and can't be on the list until we arrived. I said it sounds like they don't offer any considerations for seniors or handicapped people. She put me on hold to ""go ask her manager"".  About 5 minutes later, Manager (name starts with J) comes to the phone and says ""hello?"" Without announcing herself as the manager. So I explain I'm waiting for Jessica to come back after asking a manager about call ahead seating for elderly/handicapped patrons. The manager took many long, repeated sentences to imply I was asking for unfairly special treatment, that there was nothing they can or would do to accommodate an elderly person other than ""pulling up a chair for him to sit on or giving him a drink while he waits"" and she had the nerve to make it a point ""there are many other handicapped customers waiting there"" at the time too!  I said sarcastically that I would never think of cutting the line in front of other seniors or handicapped customers! She just kept implying I was asking too much.  HORRIBLE HOSTESS SERVICE Since I was driving while talking to her, I got there in less than 5 minutes and my dad (he is hunched over 90 degrees) asked the hostess for a number. 1) There were ZERO OTHER HANDICAPPED CUSTOMERS. 2) There were no seats available and neither of the two hostesses offered him a seat 3) we still waited exactly 15 minutes for a table! DEPLORABLE TABLE SERVICE (Receipt 0542, 5/15/16 19:58, Rec 459. Table 21. Term 9) Our server seated us, told us the normal server is on lunch break, and ran off hastily. (The receipt says Ashley A but I don't know which one is Ashley.) my complaint is with the ""fill in"" server, a light toned woman in her 20s with glasses and long dark hair. The normal server is African-American and I had no issue with her. ""Ms. Fill In server"" hastily ran off to help other tables. Fine, I get that. We saw her maybe 15x during the first 30 minutes of the meal but she only came to our table twice! She said she was checking on the bread and would bring it to us as soon as it was done baking. AFTER 10 MINUTES SHE BROUGHT US THE BREAD AND IT WAS STONE COLD AND ROCK HARD!! Sure, it was still baking? THEY BROUGHT OUR ENTREES AND AT THE SAME TIME MS. FILL-IN-SERVER CLEARED AWAY BOTH OUR SMALL EMPTY BREAD PLATES BUT LEFT THE BUTTER AND BASKET OF (ICE COLD) BREAD WHERE IT WAS! I HAVE NEVER SEEN THIS DONE BEFORE AND DONT UNDERSTAND THE LOGIC! MY DAD AND I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE TO PUT OUR BREAD AFTER BUTTERING IT! AWKWARD!! TINY PORTIONS!! I had a chicken chili over rice entree. The entire goulash fit into the tiny 6"" x 1"" center portion of a huge bowl. I ate it all in 10 spoonfuls and was still starving. I don't know how the other reviewer of 2 months ago could have gotten huge portions? The part I was most disappointed with was Ms Fill-in Server stopped by after we had been served, asked robotically ""how is everything tasting?"" When I clearly hadn't even touched my entree yet (I was busy tearing apart the COLD HARD BREAD) and when I immediately looked up at her and answered ""I hadn't tried the food yet..."" THE SERVER WAS STILL STANDING AT MY TABLE FACING ME BUT WAS STARING ACROSS THE ROOM AT SOMETHING ELSE!! WAS THAT INSULTING!! SHE DISNT EVEN HEAR WHAT I SAID AND RAN OFF WITHOUT LISTENING!!  DISHONEST GRATUITY GUIDELINES Tip is optional. The tip is always a % of the meal total bill BEFORE TAXES. Not at this dishonest establishment! They print the tip guidelines on your receipt and I clearly see the 15, 20 and 25% are based on the total bill INCLUDING TAX! This is intended to deceive customers into paying 10% more tip than they intended to pay (for example if you intend to pay 20% of the meal amount, you actually pay 22% because you're paying 20% of the meal plus taxes)! Great customer service Cheesecake Factory! ""HORRIBLY amazing!!"""
K H.,"Webster, NY",0,22,,1.0,8/24/2017,"I do curb takeout due to handicap. Last night I ordered crispy Cuban rolls. I got a creamy white dipping sauce that ruined the appetizer. I called and the manager said the new sauce is a Corporate decision. Really? French country salad which I love was full of bitter red leaves which I think was Radiccio with 2 pieces of goat cheese and about 1 pecan crushed up. Tasted nothing like which I ordered many times. Lastly, my love for their cheesecake is gone. The new Celebration cheesecake is bland, blah! After coming here dozens of times, I'm done!"
Marialis R.,"Rochester, NY",0,1,,5.0,8/21/2017,"Update: Best cheesecake ever!! Entire family loved it. Going back this weekend!! This was the first time I have came into a Cheescake Factory. I was nervous since when I pulled up there were so many vehicles and all I was going for was to buy a cheesecake for my husbands birthday. The inside was busy but the front was fast service and kind!!  Well, I was surprised at the prices but then saw the pieces and they're huge. So I went ahead and bought a 7inch one along with a slice for my daughter to try. Paid for it and the server went back to get it for me. She came back with a bad news good news comment and I was initially nervous. She said they were out of the 7 inch one that I purchased but that the manager gave the okay to give me the 10 inch one at no extra charge. I am impressed because other places wouldn't have done that! I must give them great review since they saved my husbands birthday. He really wanted that one and could just afford the 7 inch. Thank you and they've won a customer for life!!"
Trish C.,"Scottsville, NY",0,7,,2.0,3/5/2017,"The service was just ok, food was just ok. Obviously the best part and only reason to go is for the Cheesecake. Otherwise skim the meal and just go for dessert."
Anita R.,"Rochester, NY",39,21,37,4.0,7/24/2016,"This is one of the chains I have been wanting to go forever after I came to the US. At last the place was worth the wait. For appetizer we had avocados and zucchini fries made to perfection. When you have decided to indulge might as well go all out. For entree we had their famous Evelyn's pasta. For dessert we had the Godiva chocolate cheesecake with chocolate fudge. With one layer of chocolate cake, second layer of cheesecake and the third layer of fudge mousse, this piece of heaven got me sugar-high. I was lost for a moment and all I could taste was sugar, sugar and more sugar. I am a sweet tooth person but this was a bit too strong for me. I give it 4 stars for the texture, perfection, and service :)"
Dave L.,"Rochester, NY",128,157,15,5.0,3/12/2016,I have to say this place has amazing food. The dinner portions are huge. There are great appetizers and a huge selections of dinners and dessert. They have a full bar pretty much with coke products. The staff is always friendly when I come here and will go out of your way for you. If you come hereon a Friday or Saturday expect if to be busy all night til closing.
Kari C.,"Rochester, NY",198,564,1846,3.0,2/25/2016,"We've been coming here a lot lately, like once every couple of weeks over the past two months for several family celebrations. Anyway, it's safe to say that things have taken a turn downhill in recent years as far as the food and service alike. I still have love for Cheesecake Factory, but I'm just not in love with it. My husband's all time favorite Steak Dianne With Chicken Madera combo was so bad the last few visits that he opted not to order it again and just to try something different altogether. My food has been okay, nothing special but I will say that the Adam's Peanut Butter cheesecake is amazing! It is my newest favorite. Cheesecake Factory seems overcrowded almost always despite having a large dining facility. Additionally, the waitstaff always seem overworked and frazzled. On our last visit, my husband left the table only to return and his chair was missing. Even though eight of us were sitting in the booth, someone walked by and swiped his chair because they noticed it was empty. The manger quickly replaced the chair and apologized but we were all baffled. We also witnessed a waiter spill several glasses of red wine on a gentleman at the booth behind us. Obviously their food was comped by management, but again this points back to an overworked staff. Cheesecake needs to hire more people and with more hands on deck, service should drastically improve."
