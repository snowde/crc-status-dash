Rai S.,"Rochester, NY",185,29,60,4.0,5/3/2014,I chose to go to Cheesecake Factory with a girlfriend last night. We wanted to do happy hour but were unable to make it between 4 and 6 (they need to extend it to 7!) I opted for my usual- buffalo chicken blast. They were great as always! They give you about 9 so I always order it as a meal and have leftovers to take home. I will be having it for lunch today lol. I washed that down with a pear martini- it was soooooo yummy! That was the best drink I've had at Cheesecake Factory! I suggest that for anyone- but do be aware it costs $10.50- a little on the pricey side in my opinion. My girlfriend ordered the tamale appetizer- it was very tasty and they give you a lot. Unfortunately she did not like the mushy consistency of the dish and ordered the Hawaiian pizza instead. It came out fast and was very hot. The waitress had no problem switching her dish. I opted for the dulce de leche cheesecake. Hands down one of my new favorites! It was delicious. I recommend it for anyone who likes caramel.  Although it was a busy Friday night we only had to wait 20 minutes and our waitress was very attentive. I normally don't make it a habit to spend $30 on a drink/ appetizer/ desert but this is rather average for the Cheesecake Factory. I will be back for happy hour soon!

Simone B.,"Rochester, NY",243,27,,5.0,5/9/2015,The food is always the delicious and the staff always curtsy. This is one of my favorite restaurants. They also have great food presentation!
James P.,"Felton, PA",0,22,,1.0,4/16/2016,"This cheesecake factory definitely need some work. I called ahead with a curbside order only to sit 20 minutes after telling them I was there waiting on my food for someone to come out because apparently they never put my ticket in and then just brought my food out when I called and complained that I had been sitting out there so long and no one had came out with my food. Then I had an issue with the fact that I paid extra to have extra chicken put on my lettuce wraps and when it came out it looks like the exact same amount of chicken it normally comes it. When I  spoke to the manager he did nothing about the food or the wait but stated"" is there something you want me to do""? Here is a thought, fix you food and staff. When you pay $20.00 for 3 small lettuce wraps and a small slice of Cheesecake you would hope the service and staff would be at least decent."
George M.,"Churchville, NY",0,12,,5.0,4/16/2016,First time visit for wife and myself.very helpful staff. Ordered Cuban wrappers with mustard sauce for dipping they were great!had bacon burger..

Jason L.,"Gallup, NM",129,124,289,4.0,5/26/2013,"This cheesecake factory is something that everyone need to experience. The cheesecake factory might be a restaurant chain but it is worth trying! They've got a huge cheesecake selection for dessert! When you get seated you also get complementary fresh baked loaves of wheat & sourdough bread served with a side of butter so you can nibble and pick a course.  The menu is overwhelming at first because their is so much to consider. Then you noticed the price of some of the food opinions. While the prices might be high the portions they serve are huge. The servers are nice and friendly but this is varity since it a chain resturant. I had tried the fried calamari as my appetizer, which was not bad but wished they had more variety in their sauces. I recommended the BANG BANG CHICKEN AND SHRIMP for the main course! I would consider it a Thai dish with flavors of curry, chile and coconut served with white rice. (Looks and smells delicious)  For the Cheesecake I Recommend: Ultimate Red Velvet, Mango Key Lime or Key Lime (forgot) and the Oreo Dream Extreme!"
Don W.,"Sebring, OH",3,113,139,5.0,4/15/2014,"This was my first visit to a Cheesecake Factory in NY State.  My family was here to celebrate my 12 year old grandson's birthday. Our server was above average and all our meal selections were excellent.  I ordered a BBQ Chicken Ranch Salad that was huge and very good. The servers sang Happy Birthday to my grandson and he enjoyed the entire meal experience. We arrived at 6:30 pm on a Sunday evening and which is a good time to beat the crowds on other days. Overall, I would come back again and would expect the same level of service and quality of food."
Sarah B.,"Webster, NY",0,4,,2.0,7/24/2015,"Food was delicious, service was terrible. Waitress came to the table one time we had to rely on other servers to deliver our food and refill our drinks. Went to the hostess stand and said something, waitress still didn't come over. Spoke to the manager she said we would be taken care of the rest of our time at the restaurant, clearly the message was not relayed to the waitress because we were neglected the rest of the evening. We will never return to this establishment, we paid good money and were treated horribly."
Jessica R.,"East Rochester, NY",136,7,20,3.0,8/2/2013,"Pricier than Applebees and decor is terrible. Other than that, I appreciate their new skinny menu."
Catherine R.,"Macedon, NY",0,49,27,5.0,11/4/2015,"Never disappointed. Vast menu, great food. The best wheat bread. Beautiful decor. Fun atmosphere. Friendly, good service. I keep telling myself I'm going to try something different, but I can't resist my boneless teriyaki chicken."
Felicity F.,"Geneva, NY",8,16,,2.0,12/15/2014,"Disappointed.  I love Cheesecake Factory.  It reminds me of home in California.  This one, the food sucked.  My husband got a sandwich and the meat was undercooked, was completely all chewy fat. Really not appetizing at all.  The waitress was really meh apologetic about it.  We waited FOREVER for them to replace it with a burger because we were trying to order something quick, again, not really apologetic.  I ordered the lunch orange chicken and it was okay, a little lackluster in sauce.  Otherwise the restaurant was clean, just not a great food experience.  Probably won't make a trip back to this location."
Brian M.,"Pittsford, NY",95,260,,4.0,8/7/2013,"For a chain, it's not bad.  I hate large menus, but as long as you stay with simple appetizers with an Asian flair and those well-executed items like burgers, you can't go wrong.  Not my favorite place to go because it's always crowded with people who don't know good food if it slapped them upside the head but they are always welcoming at the bar and it's great for a later night meal.  I definitely prefer it to Wegmans Next Door (which is almost next door) or either of the Italian offerings in the area like Pomodorro's.  3.5 out of 5.  It is what it is and it doesn't purport to be anything fancy and for that reason, I'm a bit more generous than I might otherwise be.  It seems to be a staple on the birthday celebration list for most of the city. But as for cheesecake, I make better (and mine is also better than Cheesy Eddie's)."
Shimon P.,"Richmond Hill, Canada",0,13,16,5.0,8/31/2011,"Perfect place with great attentive service. My daughter has gluten intolerance and staff was very open to ensure her meal is gluten free. Crab cakes are amazing. Steaks done to perfection. Meatloaf is very tasty! Once you get used to control portions ( kid's size is usually enough for adult) everything else is secondary. Low carb cheese cake is delicious! Cappuccino is perfect. It was plenty of park spaces outside (hey, it a mall nearby!) on Saturday. Complains in other reviews appear to be unfortunate events or unreasonable expectations rather than norm for this place."
Helena W.,"New York, NY",108,21,,4.0,10/27/2013,"Great cheesecake!!  We were in a relatively large group of people. We waited a bit but the place was just so packed (and kinda noisy). So, we went to another place to get food and returned to get some cheesecake as take-out desserts. I got the mango key lime cheesecake. In Brazil, that would be probably substituted by passion fruit (tropical + a little bit citric). They come in a plastic container and on the side, some whipped cream. I really liked the dough, there was a little bit of coconut in it!"
Martha R.,"Rochester, NY",0,8,,1.0,2/14/2016,Popped into get cheesecake to go... after fighting the crowd to figure who was in line and who was waiting for a table... I paid $17 for two pieces of cheesecake that were quickly prepared and stuffed into a bag... much to my surprise when I get home I found two half cooked pieces of cheesecake thrown into my bag... less than pleased!
Nicole C.,"Webster, NY",221,180,18,3.0,6/13/2014,I like the cheesecake factory. I don't think the dinners are anything out of this world though. It's quite pricey also. The cheesecakes are definitely what keeps me coming back!
Danielle R.,"San Diego, CA",880,736,702,4.0,1/27/2013,"I come here all the time and always enjoy it.  You will almost always gave to wait and if you don't that is perfect- you found that one time when it is best to go there!  I almost always have to wait.  The smaller the party, the smaller the wait time.  I understand that but it is very annoying that if 5 people come you have to wait 5x longer then everyone else.  I am not a fan of the way they have their tables set up either.  You are always sitting really close to the party next to you on either side.  There is not much privacy there so don't go on a romantic date. After the wait to get seated, I generally always have fantastic service.  The waiters are very prompt and always check back on the customers.  The menu is very overwhelming.  They offer a ton of food choices which is great, but sometimes annoying- How can I pick what I want for dinner when I have 100 different choices?  Everything that I try is always good but I generally stick to pasta dishes.   I am not a cheesecake fan but the rest of my family is.  They are all in love with the cheesecakes and I have tried some of their milkshakes and cakes and they are all good as well. The restaurant itself is really dark making it difficult to see and loud.  They pack it with so many people it can't help but become loud.  I have had a few problems with that and having children with me.  I say it is not good for children because of the long wait times, darkness, loudness and because the staff never seems to take much care in them.  they do not ask if you need a high chair or booster seat and they generally don't even want to give you a children's menu.  There are going to be kids there so treat them like you would any other customer. I have also used their take out option as well.  This is my favorite.  You call and they tell you 15 minutes no matter what.  You get there and they will bring it out to your car or you can go inside to pay and pick up.  Either way, it is generally fast.  This is my favorite option because you don't have to wait to be seated, I don't have to rely on a waiter for everything, and I don't have to pay a tip which makes it a bit cheaper. Overall-  I will continue to go here for the great food but probably just with my husband or better yet- I will get take out."
Teresa K.,"Rochester, NY",0,31,2,5.0,4/14/2015,My all time favorite restaurant. Beautiful atmosphere. Love the large menu that features anything and everything.. My favorite still is the steak Diane and shrimp scampi. The mashed potatoes are to die for! Fresh strawberry cheesecake.. Always on point! Wait staff has always been attentive but not overly attentive that it gets irritating. I have always had a great experience.. My number one go to restaurant!
Michael S.,"San Francisco, CA",64,319,9,4.0,8/20/2014,Good quality food. Good service. Silly huge portions. Everything under the sun menu. Oh! And cheesecake!
Shushuli A.,"Rochester, NY",0,3,,1.0,12/25/2014,"We went there two nights ago with my husband on our way to gym. The waiter was not that nice towards us. on taking our order he didn't say a word. We went just for beer and nachos. I believe it was just a one time mistake, but the nachos was covered in salt. I tried very hard, but couldn't eat more than 2 or 3. Previously I loved their nachos, this time it was completely different."
