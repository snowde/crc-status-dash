Jonathan S.,"Sharon, MA",164,381,,3.0,5/18/2014,"You know your life has taken a dark turn when you find yourself at The Cheesecake Factory on a random night ordering just drinks and a few cheesecake slices with a friend. The drinks are overpriced and on the weak side, but the cheesecake is always amazing. How did I end up spending $40 for 2 slices and two drinks, I'll never know. Damn you Cheesecake, you win again!"
Heather B.,"Rochester, NY",44,17,3,4.0,12/6/2015,"I always have a good experience at Cheesecake Factory. The service was great and the food is always enjoyable. I tend to either get a burger or the chicken sandwich, as both are delicious. I always wait for a booth because the tables are way too close together."
A N.,"Rochester, NY",0,19,,1.0,8/11/2015,"Me and my family came Friday the 7th. The waitress we had was blonde, looked to be in her mid 20's to early 30's. She seemed like it was going to kill her to serve us. She probably had a preconceived notion of how African americans tip, gave us terrible service and lucked out on a really good tip. She talked about us to a white couple sitting down from us. She took our drink orders at different times instead of all at once and walked around doing nothing half the time, taking her time to bring our drinks. She was more engaging with other tables she waited on. The Godiva brownie sundae was really good. Other than that my family wont be coming back."
Matt C.,"Henrietta, NY",0,20,15,4.0,1/6/2013,"Very wide selection of entrees as well as less-than-entrees, such as appetizers, ""lite fare"" items, etc.  Lots of wines too but limited array of beers (understandable: this is an Italian food/steak place mostly, with some fish in there too, and all these are traditionally wine dishes). I have ""barometer dishes"" for different kinds of restaurants.  For diners, its eggs benedict or NE clam chowder.  For Chinese rstrnts, it's wonton soup and sweet and sour chicken.  Basically, ""baseline competence"" dishes.  For Italian rstrnts, it's spaghetti carbonara.  That's what I ordered last night at this CF location and am glad to report, they passed this test quite nicely. :). Had no trouble finishing the dish even after a fair bit of bread (warm, soft, good, and no shortage of butter-- nice change).  Service was attentive and friendly but not hovering (hate that). Final opinion: Recommended!  But be aware, this is a popular place, esp. on wkends, so reservs. are recommended, too.  Otherwise you can wait up to an hr., easily."
Nick H.,"Pittsford, NY",30,52,2,3.0,11/23/2012,"The Cheesecake Factory formula is certainly followed here. Good service, well-staffed, huge menu, huge portions. If you've been to one CF, you've been to them all."
Josh P.,"Brooklyn, NY",22,9,,2.0,9/26/2013,"I've been to many Cheesecake factories in the past--and usually I really enjoy it. This time, however, I ordered the Carlton salad without Chicken (because I'm a vegetarian) and thanks to the staff at Cheesecake, I had my first bite of chicken in 5 years. When I mentioned it to the waitress, she got me another salad--this time it didn't have avocado (as promised on the menu). The manager never came over to apologize, no dessert was offered and no salad was comped. Tired from a long day of working, I didn't feel like complaining--so we paid the bill. I certainly wouldn't go to this restaurant if you expect food to arrive as ordered. Everyone was nice and the food was fine, just not what was ordered. And the customer service, although not bad, was just ignorant."
Morgan B.,"Rochester, NY",0,4,2,1.0,8/10/2015,"Poor service and my entire party of 7 had diarrhea the next day. Our server was very unprofessional and used single words to address us, like ""done?"" ""Box?""  ""Good?""  Please man, have some motivation its your job. Our plates sat in the window for at least 15 minutes too."
Michael B.,"Philadelphia, PA",16,46,,1.0,3/19/2016,"Last Wednesday my wife, myself, and our infant daughter attempted to go here for dinner. We asked if we could be seated in a place where we could have our stroller with us, so our daughter could sleep in it if she chose. The hostess brought us to a table, and said we could keep the stroller in front of the table, which was located right in the main walkway of the restaurant, and would block everyone attempting to walk through in any direction. I looked around the restaurant, and saw many booths open that would perfectly accommodate what my wife and I were looking for. The hostess said no to all of the open booths, but did not explain why. We then said we couldn't stay without a different table since we had our infant. She said that was fine, so we left. It was very clear that she did not want to help us out in any manner, and it actually felt as if she didn't want us to stay. It would be different if it had been a busy night and they didn't have open tables. However, it would have been very easy for them to accommodate us. Other restaurants have had no issue with our request. The hostess was extremely rude. My wife and I were appalled by this experience, and will never be back."
John D.,"Rochester, NY",0,119,2,2.0,4/3/2014,"The Cheesecake Factory is one of my default restaurants when I go out and don't have any idea where to go; I am not a big fan of the place, but it has a large variety of decent (but by no means incredible) food that usually does the job. I've ordered several dishes from here and most have been OK. However, recently, I ordered the Moroccan Chicken and it was disgusting. Except for the raisins which came with it, it was quite flavorless. The dish is supposed to come with harissa sauce (which is a spicy chili-based sauce), but instead comes with a thick, creamy and tasteless red-colored sauce. On top of that, the chicken was incredibly buttery and the Israeli couscous was a bit undercooked (I would have expected regular couscous for a Moroccan dish, not Israeli couscous). Basically, this dish was tasteless and had no passing resemblance to real Moroccan food."
Rochelle M.,"Rochester, NY",8,3,4,5.0,5/12/2014,Love the jambalaya pasta and happy hour cocktails. The bartender Megan is so friendly and genuine! Love this place.
Neil R.,"Rochester, NY",56,371,23,4.0,10/11/2013,"I remain a loyal fan of CF - I love the insanely vast food selection and obviously the cheesecake is amazing.  I tend to get the chicken salad dishes which provide very good portions, but I have also had some of their sandwiches for lunch and they are excellent.  I have also hung out at the bar several times and the liquor selection is pretty solid.  The service - both sit down and at the bar - has always been stellar.  I find CF to be a reliable place to go for some good food and atmosphere.  Its a chain but honestly, who cares?  I am not a chain-hater and love to frequent them as you know what you get (i.e. see Applebees review).  This place does get really busy at peak dinner hours - especially on fridays and saturdays - buyer beware!"
Keenan S.,"Rochester, NY",0,11,,4.0,1/11/2014,"The 20 page menu is Nuts...too much for no reason. The one thing I wanted - ribs - is not on the menu! Service was prompt. The wait was long, but we were there 6pm on a Saturday night so that is to be expected. The mac&cheese burger was good but small burger and smaller amount of mac&cheese. everyone else enjoyed their meals too.  some had enough food to do a doggie bag. the pasta plates looked huge.  i will go again, but not on saturday night."
Joe S.,"Rochester, NY",11,10,32,3.0,2/1/2014,"Service was great. The bartender took real good care of us. The only thing I will say is that the kitchen should pay more attention to prep. Cooked shrimp with legs still on it is kinda...well...lazy. Second time trying after a bad first. The end result, inhuman have to go back one more time."
Erica T.,"Bakersfield, CA",6,26,10,4.0,3/27/2011,"My mother, future mother in law, girlfriend and I went here after a day of trying on wedding gowns.  We were tired, hungry and ready to relax.  Although the tables were really close together (we were in the section where half the people sit on a bench against a wall and half are in chairs), we had such a wonderful time.  My mom has a gluten allergy, and the wait staff was more than willing to help her with that.  They even sent over a manager to go over things more clearly and specified that they'd be happy to make any dish gluten free for her.   The staff was great, the food was hot and delicious, and we couldn't have asked for a better end to the day.  :)"
vincent n.,"Rochester, NY",2,4,2,4.0,2/23/2011,"Took the gf there yesterday for some drinks to celebrate what is soon to be my lack of unemployment.  She had never been so she thought it was very nice inside and she loved their cosmo's while I just had yuengling on draft.  We had the taquitos for an appetizer and then she ordered the godiva chocolate cheesecake for our dessert.  The taquitos tasted freshly made and were delicious and I can't begin to tell you how good the cheesecake was.  Our waitress, I can't remember her name was great and was always there when we needed something even though she was pretty busy in her bar section.  We will definitely be back for their happy hour and maybe next time even a whole meal of food."
Fred S.,"Rochester, NY",0,7,,4.0,10/6/2013,"This one is a good one for just the two of you, or the whole gang. Only one iffy experience ,wife got a little old fish,but they took care of us. They have a cuban sandwich that will knock your socks off (#1 or #2 in the whole area,only competition for the Cuban is Georgies Bakery) Last time we were there we had 9-10 people ,one guest gave a very difficult request to the bartender,""something w/champagne with other stuff too, but mostly champagne,make it good""  WTH  anyway the drink came and she was extremely pleased.good job This one is in regular rotation."
somi b.,"Rochester, NY",1,25,13,5.0,6/2/2013,"One of our go to place. Love love love. Amazing food, portion size and taste. Never been disappointed. Normally I am against chain restaurants but this place always get it correct. Reasonable prices and me and wife always share everything here because portion sizes are huge. Even though there cheescakes are amazing everyone should try Chocolate cakes they have. Oh my goodness trust me I have seen heaven from earth few times having Chocolate cakes from Cheesecake Factory."
Megan H.,"Rochester, NY",166,161,166,4.0,5/6/2014,"A menu that has something for everyone and anyone! I have never had a bad dish from this place. Although it is a corporate chain, all the meals are fantastic! My company chooses this place every year for our holiday luncheon... mainly because of its wide variety, and the fact that the men want steak and the ladies want pasta or chicken. Satisfies everybody! The staff is always very friendly, don't always see that at a Corp place. They serve warm, bread and butter and quality bread at that. My favorite appetizer are the southwest  eggrolls...omg! So good! I lean towards their chicken dishes for some reason when I dine here. Always a good meal. Can't go wrong. Cheesecakes of coarse are wonderful, my two favorites would be the pineapple upside and the chocolate raspberry.  The godiva is very good as well but also very rich (heads up) if you are ever in search of a place to satisfy a large party with different interests or cravings - consider the cheesecake factory, you won't go wrong."
Evelyn B.,"Tallahassee, FL",6,138,2,5.0,6/21/2013,This place is great! 5 of my friends and I went here for Easter dinner and it was delicious and the waiter was hilarious! We had a great time and would definitely go back.
Chenelle P.,"Brooklyn, NY",3,3,2,2.0,1/14/2013,"Usually love this place, but as for my last visit, I would say I might never come back to this branch. Idk if they had a bad night, but the usually friendly staff was very rude. As I waited to order  takeout, 3 workers walked right passed me w/o acknowledging my presence. And after waiting for almost 10 mins for someone to take my takeout order,when I finally got my food, the order was wrong"
