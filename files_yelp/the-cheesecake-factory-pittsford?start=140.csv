Leigh A.,"Rochester, NY",0,4,1,1.0,4/16/2014,"I went in today for a quick ""something"" to eat. I was tired and needed some caffeine and something in my stomach before a work engagement this evening. I sat at the bar, and told the bartender I had 30 minutes before I had to leave and I wanted to grab a quick bite. I was the only one seated at the bar, though he was cranking out drinks as it was 5:30 p.m. and the restaurant was picking up the pace for happy hour table service. I ordered a cappuccino, and it came out promptly, though the mug was dirty.  I asked for a glass of water, which was oddly only filled 1/2 way. Then, because I was in a strange mood and couldn't figure out what to order, I asked for a french dip sandwich (goes by something else there but I can't recall the name).  The bartender was average. Not overly nice and welcoming, but not rude either. Honestly, I would expect a tiny bit more hospitality from him being that I was the *only* one at the bar.  20 minutes goes by, and still no sandwich. At this point, with 10 minutes before I have to leave, I told the bartender I had to leave soon and for him to please ask that they just put it in a to-go container. They bring out the sandwich about three minutes later, in a to go container.  I still have about 7 minutes before I have to leave, and I want a bit of it, so I open the container at the bar.  I notice right away that the horseradish sauce that goes with the sandwich is barely 1/3 full, it was a tiny amount, not nearly enough for the ratio of the sandwich. Fail. Then, I quickly notice that there is barely any meat on the sandwich.  I glance at the bill to remember how much this little deal is costing - $14.95.  Normally I'm not a price-conscious person insofar as I'll order what I want within reason and don't consider price as a forefront in my decision making; I can afford it. But who likes to get ripped off? It you want to charge me $15 for a small piece of skinny french baguette and some sliced beef, it better be damn good quality.  Well, it wasn't.  The first piece of beef I saw in my sandwich was *covered* with fatty grizzle - totally inedible.  It was a big piece that a line cook should've immediately nixed from being part of a dish. Totally unappetizing, and it validated quickly my first impressions of the sandwich as being a sub-par rip off. Then, I take a bite of the sandwich, after I pulled out the fatty/grizzly piece.  There was a DISGUSTING piece of something foreign in my sandwich. I don't even know what it was.  I was about 4 inches, and stalk-like, though old and dried up, like a straw. I have no idea if it was a once-edible item, or a completely inedible piece of wood or something, but it literally made my stomach turn.  I have been nauseous since this experience, all night, I am not even kidding.  The bartender tapped out after I showed him what was in my sandwich.  I'm not sure if he apologized. If he did, it was obviously unmemorable and insincere.  I asked to see the manager.  A young lady, pleasant, came over and I explained the situation.  I told her that the bartender was nice and it had nothing to do with him (not exactly true, in retrospect, insofar as my overall satisfaction and experience).  I had to tell her I wasn't paying for the sandwich - s"
Mike O.,"Auburn, NY",30,16,2,2.0,11/20/2013,"tues 11/19/13...no management to be seen and the hostess was not interested in seeing us arrive as she was into something more important than incoming customers, not ever a warm greeting just ""wait there and ill be right with you"" first, we found nothing negative to say about the food we ordered. all was good and somewhat better than most chain restaurants, we had Cesar salad, burgers with house salad and pumpkin cheesecake for desert all at a cost of $47.57. + NO TIP!  at 2;10 that afternoon. BUT....THE SERVICE WAS AWFUL. We could see that there were 3 servers working and at most 4 tables of customers and while we waited and waited 2 more new arrivals were seated SO...After waiting 15 min to order our server arrived. we placed our order and ...another long wait [20min] for our food.. food arrived and waitress disappeared for 15min or more anyway we were put out that out late lunch took almost an hour. another observation,..one more thing...the 2 female servers wore the tightest fitting white pants that were not suitable  for the size of there derrieres. disgusting to see"
Edward J.,"Rochester, NY",0,2,,1.0,5/11/2014,Awful place don't come here! Hour long wait for food and 40 minutes to get a table. Awful food and way too expensive (10$ for a drink what?!!!) Save your money and go somewhere else this makes all the other chains look bad!!
Andrea H.,"Rochester, NY",33,34,3,4.0,10/6/2012,"The cheese cake here is very good. There are tons of choices. Last time I was here I tried an apple streusel cheesecake and liked it. They also have a pumpkin cheesecake but it doesn't debut until October (bummer). The food is good but not amazing especially for how expensive it is. I gave it 4 stars because it lives up to its name as far as the cheesecakes go, food and drinks are good, the menu has a good selection and the decor and atmosphere is nice also. I enjoy dining here."
Kiana B.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,117,33,2.0,2/29/2012,Typically I'm satisfied with Cheesecake Factory but I was disappointed that they ran out of tuna for the Tuna Tataki Salad. Instead the server substituted salmon. I was underwhelmed. The tiramisu and strawberry lemonade were good.
James M.,"Houston, TX",109,134,9,2.0,6/1/2011,"Why I Hate the Cheesecake Factory Sure, there are s$#!tier restaurants serving s$#!tier food, but none seem to bother me as much as Cheesecake Factory.  I've been to CF twice.  Both times the food was edible, the service adequate, and I hated it. Why CF is so often the object of my contempt is that it is so wildly popular for precisely the reason I despise it.   The CF is not unlike your typical neighborhood burger, sandwich, wrap, salad, Thai, mandarin, Creole/Cajun, classical and contemporary Italian, Tex-Mex, soul food, [insert regionally specific cuisine for your franchise's location], weight management and cheesecake, restaurant. Yeah, wrap your mind around that (and what the hell is weight management fare from a place who's name implies that they manufacture fat?). The menu is over 15 pages and that doesn't even include inserts and ad space. Yes, advertising space in the menu, which comes in handy all those times I'm struggling with the menu because ""I'm kind of in the mood for a steak, but I have been meaning to try the hot air balloon over the Serengeti.""  What self-respecting restaurant whores out its menu space to ads? I had to flip through the menu 10 times to try and get any sense of what to order. The menu is certainly a product of, and geared toward, the ADD generation. Further confounding the absolute cluster-f#@! that is CF's menu, everything is listed under Specials! It must be my lucky f$#!ing day, finally, a restaurant that specializes in EVERYTHING! After several minutes I gave up and ordered a shrimp club and a Ritalin smoothie.   Conceptually, CF is just ridiculous. When I see a menu even a quarter the size of the one at CF, alarms go off.  It is nearly impossible for any restaurant to stock, prep and prepare that many dishes, and execute all with any degree of care. And let's be serious, CF isn't exactly pulling from the ranks of Le Cordon Bleu in the first place. CF basically applies the Olive Garden model of adapting Italian dishes to American tastes by making them terrible, and expands this concept to cuisine from around the world, but with more cheesecake. CF tries to please all with a mind-numbing array of dishes that, despite their best intentions, are all pretty pedestrian. I would be much more impressed if CF could make one thing very well, rather than a 100 kinds of disappointing.   The service could be worse.  The giant booths pretty much ensure that your app plates and empty glasses will keep you company for the duration of your meal, and if you're seated on the outside you will need to pass quite a few plates.  Servers seem to deliver meals by wandering about the dining room, stopping at every table to ask if the food in their hand is per chance what you ordered, which is cool because that conversation I was having was getting boring anyways.   I might be able to understand the appeal if the food was cheap, seeing as I've been known to eat some real trash in order to save money, but a night out at CF runs a pretty large bill.  Most of the entrees are below $20 but the cocktails and signature desserts will each cost you about $10.  So figure a hot date at Cheesecake will run you two entrees  (unless you can convince her to order off the kids menu) desserts, because what trip to CF is complete without Cheesecake, 8 or 9 drinks because I'm going to have to be inebriated to get through this night, and I'm out of there about $120 poorer and 8,000 calories fatter.     I must hand it to CF, though. They certainly are at no shortage of business. Every night they pack them in, with people waiting over 2 hours for the privilege to dine at a chain restaurant. People everywhere rave about it as if they just finished a 40 course tasting menu at El Bulli. CF set up shop in Rochester only 2 years ago and in that time it has conquered the city. More than any other restaurant in town, I've heard coworkers, acquaintances and former friends, announce CF as the setting for birthdays, graduations, anniversaries and other special events to shrieks of delight and envy from anyone within earshot. Mere utterance of CF will almost certainly be met with ""OMG, you're so lucky! I love the wang bang Chinese chipotle chicken alfredo, and the lava quadruple fudge banana kaboom cheesecake is my favorite!""   Despite my bewilderment and disgust, CF thrilled thousands today with their bastardized versions of dishes that could have been had better and cheaper just down the street. If you want Italian, go to an Italian restaurant.  If its Thai you're after, check out a Thai restaurant. If everyone in your dining party wants something different and refuses to compromise and CF is absolutely, positively the only way to satisfy them all-then get new friends and go to a real restaurant. Someday CF will take its place among the pantheon of failed chain concepts and be included with the likes of Chi-Chi's, Bennigans and Jack Astor's. I can only hope that this day comes before I jam a chopstick in my ear hole"
Vancy B.,"Windsor, NY",0,4,,2.0,10/26/2013,Service at the bar was deplorable. Bartenders ignored us for ten minutes and only served when we asked for service. For the markups on drinks they could well afford another bartender on a Saturday night.
Nina R.,"Rochester, NY",9,29,5,2.0,9/25/2011,"Really why must this place serve food? They need to keep it limited to the cheesecake and that's it..oh plus the drinks too. I have tried this place a few times and I can't, just can't understand why they refuse to add seasoning to their foods.  I ordered fettucini alfredo with broccoli before and the broccoli was the only thing that had flavor, which is sad. I don't add salt and pepper to my food but I was tearing up the salt shaker and still lost. The only reason I would come back is for the cheesecake and the alcohol of course."
Bo S.,"Rochester, NY",22,30,4,2.0,5/11/2011,"Called me the next day to apologize - that's good customer service, although I'm still a little wary from being lost in the shuffle the day before."
Denise B.,"San Francisco, CA",551,1403,3,4.0,5/8/2008,"Huge 25 plus page menu.  Good drinks (lots of options for anyone's desires), pages and pages of appetizers, entrees and anything you could possibly crave, from American to Mexican to Asian even.  Pages of endless cheeescake options, every flavor you like!  Great super star server who went above and beyond to serve us.   Too bad we didn't discover this place until the end of our trip."
Jim E.,"Belleville, Canada",455,286,1086,5.0,7/18/2011,"We came on a Sunday night just after 5, we were surprised there was no wait which was perfect since we were late in getting to the Rochester Red Wings Game.  We had quick friendly service, it's the first time I had Nachos at the Cheesecake Factory, portions were a plenty and the Cheesecake was great as usual!"
Rob C.,"Greene, NY",2,19,1,4.0,5/27/2012,"We arrived for dinner and it was relatively busy. We were seated quickly however and our waitress was very friendly. We had avocado eggrolls as an appetizer because it sounded different. It ended up being quite delicious. I had the Hibachi Steak which also came with shiitake mushrooms, onions, bean sprouts, wasabi mashed potatoes and tempura asparagus. I'm not a potato fan so I can't speak to how that was. The steak and other sides were very tasty. I'm a sucker for tempura vegetables and they did not let down. The steak and other vegetables were delicious as well. I'm a big cheesecake fan and decided to try the mango key lime cheesecake for dessert. I was sadly a little disappointed as it wasn't as good as I expected but it could have just been the flavor combination that didn't work for me. All in all our food was very good, we had good service, and the price wasn't too terrible."
Jon P.,"Webster, NY",0,34,,5.0,9/1/2009,"much better food this time, got chicken basil chicken, it was very good."
