Rohan N.,"Rochester, NY",81,81,20,4.0,5/10/2016,"We dined on a not-so-busy weekday 2 times last week. Over the 2 visits, we ordered Evelyn's Favorite Pasta, Eggplant Parmesan on one visit and on the second visit, we had the Veggie Melt Sandwich and Ratatouille Toast. All of the entrees were good. My wife though wished to have lesser broccoli on her pasta (evelyn's). Service was a strict-OK. We're regulars here and often leave happy with the food quality and the cheesecakes."
Jason R.,"Rochester, NY",0,2,1,2.0,7/8/2017,"The food is okay, but my biggest complaint is that the tap lines are filthy. Every time I get a beer at this place I can't even tell what I'm drinking because it just tastes like old, oxidized beer. It doesn't help that drafts are like $7."
Lindsay Z.,"Kissimmee, FL",359,85,141,4.0,6/17/2016,The chicken bellagio is amazing as well as the bang bang chicken & shrimp. My personal favorite cheesecake is the 30th Anniversary. Service is pretty good. Not great for large parties.
Alex M.,"Rochester, NY",72,14,1,5.0,10/28/2016,"Always amazing service! The cheesecake is the best in the area. Not only are they works of art but they taste divine! Edible art! The variety is superb and you can really taste that everything is made fresh and with care. My personal favorite is the Oreo cheesecake, it's simply decadent."
Sakura F.,"Vestal, NY",5,14,30,4.0,10/4/2015,"The food may be a little expensive, but it's yummy and worth it if you order the right plate. The Louisiana pasta is great (spicy!) and fills you up! The free bread is also delicious, and you can ask for refills. The waiters and waitresses are nice and helpful.  Of course, the cheesecake is wonderful as well. They are expensive, but delicious. We got the fresh strawberry cheesecake. Don't worry if you're full from dinner; you can always get the cheesecake to go ^^  The wait for dinner was around 30 minutes, so be prepared to wait a little. There's also a bar, but we didn't try any drinks. The lighting is a bit dim in the restaurant. Also, the bathroom is gorgeous!"
Aubrey K.,"Rochester, NY",120,113,281,4.0,4/1/2015,"I was very pleasantly surprised by my experience at the Cheesecake Factory this week! I was somewhat dreading the occasion 1) because it's a chain, for which I never have high hopes, and 2) because I hadn't had time to look at the menu ahead of time and that gives me mild anxiety. AHHH.  My lunch companion and I were seated very quickly, and our waitress was very quick to greet us and take our orders. We were asked if we wanted bread - umm, yes, I always want carbs. Hit me. The butter is in pre-wrapped little patts that were semi frozen. The sourdough and the honey wheat breads were good though! And warm! My friend got the spaghetti and meatballs, and I got a caesar salad - we were feeling SO adventurous, I know. Our food came out at the same time, yay! I hate having to awkwardly wait when entrees don't come out at the same time.  The food was very good, my croutons were amazeballs, they tasted like garlic bread (they probably WERE garlic bread at one time). The portions were gigantic, which is always okay with me. I paid $9.95 for a salad that would've been big enough to get 2 meals out of (but dressed salad doesn't keep well, so I ate it all.) The cheesecakes in the display case looked awesome, but I had a day drinking appointment to keep later in the day, so I opted for no cheesecake this time. One must have priorities, right? According to some other reviews there is a semi-secret happy hour and they make a mean Long Island iced tea, so I'll be back for happy hour soon to check it out. Long Islands are my jam."
Greg F.,"Forestport, NY",0,12,1,5.0,12/4/2016,Just plain fantastic.    No other words for it.   Huge extensive menu and many many choices for dessert.
William P.,"Rochester, NY",0,14,,2.0,5/15/2016,"Just had brunch at Cheesecake Factory. The place is typically average but today was really sub standard. Every meal in our party of four came out wrong. All eggs were undercooked, bacon too, toast charred on one side and turned over so we wouldn't notice. Servers noticed everything and were helpful and upset by poor food quality.  Try somewhere else on Sunday. They definitely had the 'C' team on including management that didn't catch it. Servers were great."
Jan N.,"Rochester, NY",67,131,763,2.0,3/8/2014,"This place was packed! Tables turn over often and there's a constant buzz of noise that I found myself sitting in a hunchback of Cheesecake Factory position to hear my conversation. The tables for pairs are spaced out just enough for the next table's skinny waiter to squeeze in between and we often got the arse end of his service. Our waiter and hostess were friendly and fast. We started with Cuban rolls which tasted like egg rolls stuffed with corn beef. They were crispy but a little salty. I wasn't a fan of the side sauce when I did a taste test but it offsets the saltiness of the roll together....or maybe my tastebuds became immune to the salt. I ordered the tuna tataki salad entree which was lettuce, tomato, tuna, and ginger all placed separately on the dish. The tuna was seared and encrusted with black pepper. The sauce on the side gave the tuna a little zing of flavor. I think the salad is overpriced at $17 for 5 pieces of tuna. For dessert, we ordered the red velvet cheesecake and the lemoncello cake. The red velvet cake was dry and not enough cheese. Instead, it was a topped with a dense layer of what seemed like crisco as the frosting. It looked like fondant in form but the texture was like crisco. Ew. On the other hand, the lemoncello cake was light and moist with a nice hint of lemon. Dessert portions were huge so it justifies the cost but make sure you pick a good one. Overall, it is a good place to go if you want options because their menu is 20+ pages.  I'm biased and prefer mom and pop restaurants versus chains so I probably won't be back unless a friend picks this place again. There's plenty of other menu items to try."
Marissa N.,"Rochester, NY",256,1013,2343,2.0,4/30/2015,"Oh blah, shame on me for ordering ""dynamite"" shrimp a fried appetizer to go, but shame on them for slicing them in half and frying them to death. I found it absolutely peculiar to have dry yet moily (moisty oily) shrimp. The cheese cake however is pretty serious stuff. The Oreo one was rife with textures creamy and crunchy flavors."
Katie O.,"Rochester, NY",188,177,252,2.0,1/19/2014,"We don't like actually eating here because it is a ZOO and the experience is meh at best. The food is also not that great, even the cheesecake (much to my parents' dismay). We have 2 ""favorite"" (using the term loosely) dishes: Chinese chicken salad and the spicy chipotle chicken pasta. Honestly the chicken in the pasta isn't even that good (sometimes can be tough), but the pasta and sauce are great. We recently got take out on our way to a movie and it worked out well!  Portions are large. Food is overpriced. It's a chain and you feel like you're in a factory when you eat here. We only go if one of us is really craving one of these two dishes, or if coworkers want to go, etc.  I am always mystified by the massive lines here because it is really not that good... but whatever... I guess there's something for everyone on their massive menu."
Brian W.,"Rochester, NY",0,2,,1.0,6/1/2016,Bland gross fish tacos with black beans that looked like they came from a tar pit. Bad   fiance got a sandwich equivalent to arbys.we complained and didn't hardly eat anything. All they did was give us free cheesecake. So we called the Gmail next day for a full refund.never going back
James W.,"West Hollywood, CA",2665,1908,8066,4.0,12/1/2014,"This one's pretty good! Located in Pittsford Plaza, it has ample parking. The wait is usually manageable, 30-45 min on busy nights. You get the little notifier gadget. In any case, the food here is pretty good. I've had some misses before, but overall it's delicious. I tried one of their shrimp dishes, herb-encrusted salmon, and steak. All were great. My steak came with wasabi mashed potatoes.  The cheesecakes are delicious, but don't get the mint bark one. It was basically crushed peppermint candies scattered over a regular cheesecake. Not a fan..."
Ash F.,"Brockport, NY",243,113,122,5.0,3/9/2015,"I absolutely love the Cheesecake Factory. The menu is huge and I believe it has something for everyone. Their portions are HUGE! (Don't look at the calories!!) I am always so indecisive of what to get, but my favorite is the Louisiana Chicken Pasta, Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta, Tex Mex Egg Rolls, and Buffalo Blasts. Their bread is so warm and delicious. I have also gotten a Strawberry Daquiri, and it was made perfectly. The decor is lovely and the place is huge. All of the servers I have are very friendly, and their managers are very professional. One time I had a strange experience with a waiter, I reported it, and the manager gave me 50 dollars free for my next visit. Also, on the bottom of my receipt I have completed surveys and gotten 10 dollars to use.  I absolutely love their cheesecake. My favorite is the oreo dream, but the smores, tuxedo, red velvet are also DELICIOUS. It is my favorite thing to eat to bring home and snack on in the morning!  This is by far my favorite chain restaurant."
Michael C.,"Markham, Canada",1,19,41,5.0,3/26/2016,"Love this place. Came here for the first time at the behest of my wife. I sighed inwardly...another chain restaurant. But the staff was fantastic. Front of house gave us a booth near the wind on which was great as we had a child. The servers were all very courteous and I have to say well trained. They moved fluidly, they were genuine and worked pretty hard. We ordered the chicken Madeira and shrimp+chicken gumbo. Both very good choices. The chicken was moist and flavour very balanced. The madeira flavour came through without being overpowring, and for the gumbo, the creaminess of the dish was cut by the tomatoes and white rice. Portions are v generous but we managed to finish them.  For dessert, we have the raspberry lemon cheesecake, at the recommendation of our server. Absolutely delicious, simply one of th tastiest cheesecakes ever. Creamy but not too heavy, fragrant and lemony and served with whipped cream and a raspberry lemon coulis. Highly recommended and I would love to visit again. Tip, come before 6pm and the dont really do reservations. There was a massive line when we left at 640pm."
Joan H.,"Schenectady, NY",37,235,771,2.0,11/13/2015,We were off to visit my granddaughter at college and go to lunch in Rochester and she picked this place... I think this place is very over rated.  My granddaughter had Orange Chicken served with White Rice and Vegetables... she said it was dry My second granddaughter had Fettuccini Alfredo child's size and it was plenty big enough and she did like it but then she would like any pasta. My daughter had Southwest Chicken Sandwich she said it was good and I had Shepherd's Pie which was way to greasy.  Gave me indigestion. We ordered 2 cheese cakes slices to share which was the best thing we had.  The place is way over priced for lunch but we went because my Granddaughter wanted to.
Serena T.,"Seattle, WA",247,302,1278,3.0,12/13/2014,"Given that Cheesecake Factory is a chain restaurant, I wouldn't expect it to be exceptionally higher than other chain restaurants. Just a mediocre restaurant as far as food is concerned. But when it comes to ambiance, it is a clean, neat place with welcoming staff; this, alone makes cheesecake factory a lot better than probably three quarter of other chain restaurants. Well, we have only been to this place when we are in a very large group and have always made an awful lot of noise. Those sitting around us probably hate us, but nobody has ever complained. So it is a pretty good destination if you are a loud group.  The food is just ok; very greasy and far from what a good local restaurant would offer. My favorite pasta here ""pasta De Vinci"" is way too sweet, which I assume makes you wonder why I keep ordering it. It has proven to be better than other pasta dishes here. The portions are pretty big and with the huge amount of greasy, sugary ingredients added to every dish, one cannot finish up one dish by themselves.  Overall, it is ok, not a place where I would look forward to my next visit."
Andrea S.,"Walworth, NY",1,15,,3.0,8/27/2017,"We have been here plenty of times, and normally I would give them five stars for food and service, but the last few times were disappointing. They seem to run out of the same items. This was the second consecutive time they ran out of avocado egg rolls (which are divine if you've never had them). Oddly enough they still had guacamole--which when it came with my meal was a bit brown. Tasty, but not appetizing. So we then ordered the crab and artichoke dip. Guess what--out of that, too. Really? On a Saturday evening?  Skip to dinner and my black beans were hard--we're talking hard enough that whoever scooped them out should've known they were undercooked. The server was apologetic and willing to get me more, but since my son's were also undercooked, I doubted a new batch would be any different. The server also did offer to get me a different side, but I'm sure by the time it arrived we would all be done eating. We will probably be back, but I'm hoping that our next experience is a better one. If it's not, we may not come back again."
Judy H.,"Rochester, NY",99,325,167,4.0,10/16/2014,"Why are people so crazy for this place?  1st off the decor ugh, hideous and tacky, the noise level is just complemented buy music droning in the background and the wait staff look like they work in an asylum with butterfly nets (all white right down to the shoes) the food is mediocre, not bad but nothing at all special.  Plus the staff just look miserable.  Probably wont go back,  10/16/14 went today around 2:00 with a large group for lunch. The food was great, the service amazing. Adding a star. I still hate the decor though."
Selena T.,"Rochester, NY",1,10,,3.0,3/30/2017,The food is OK but a little pricey especially the cake.
