Mae G.,"Victor, NY",32,127,36,2.0,8/6/2014,"Went here yesterday for lunch, mostly because my boyfriend and I were desperate and everywhere else's lunch hours were over.  I'd been to CF once before, and was thoroughly unimpressed.  Had I not been uncomfortably hungry, I would have held out for something else.   I think the thing I dislike the most about this place is that it doesn't actually have a specific focus.  The decor is weird and is a mix of Egyptian, Mediterranean, Italian... it's just overload.  Plus I noticed that the floors had lots of crumbs on it.  The same goes for the menu.  There's no theme, it's just a small book full of different sorts of cuisine.  It's annoying to have to search through pages and pages of options, trying to decide between Italian, Cajun, Mexican, Thai, American... and then there are soups, salads, wraps, sandwiches, burgers, actual entrees... there is even a ""skinny"" menu with lower calorie meals.  AND THIS IS JUST LUNCH.  Urgh.  Urghurghurgh. The food is average.  It's certainly nothing to write home about.  We got the mushroom, avocado, and zucchini fries, which were decent, but I would have liked better dipping sauces (it came with a ranch and a mustard one, but I didn't think they complimented the fries well).  I got the pasta carbonara, with gluten free pasta.  The best part about it was the gluten free pasta, which was not overcooked.  The rest of it was okay, but it tasted more like thin alfredo sauce with bacon and peas.  My boyfriend got the turkey burger, which he took a few bites of and stopped eating.  He said it made him feel sick. Our service was average.  We were seated quickly, and our waitress was reasonably attentive and she was cordial. But factoring in everything else, and the fact that the bill was over $40 after tip?  No thanks.  I never want to go back again."
Sharon S.,"Rochester, NY",0,10,,2.0,9/24/2016,"First of all, it's freezing in there and extremely loud. I guess with that many people in one room it's bound to be. Can overlook that I suppose. Now, the food--I had the skinny lemon shrimp and pasta. It was cold and the shrimp were w-a-y overcooked, hard and dry. No lemon flavor or any kind of flavor actually. Also had the spinach artichoke appetizer--again, no flavor to there either.  And what's up with the servers coming to the table every 2 minutes wanting to clear the plates? It was extremely annoying--I wanted to sit and have dinner with my husband and relax, not keep telling them we were'nt finished. Will not be going there again."
Aneesh R.,"Rochester, NY",63,39,16,4.0,10/27/2015,Good for appetizers and the starter bread!  The cost is very expensive for the food - but its worth it if you choose the right dish that you like.  The cheesecakes - fabulous as always!
Chris C.,"Andover, NJ",3,174,1733,4.0,8/1/2016,"We called ahead to let them know a dozen of us would be stopping by for a birthday celebration at 6pm. When we got there, we were immediately seated and our server, Christy T, quickly took our drink and appetizer order. Tasty nachos and a plate of meatballs ricotta and garlic cheese bread. Excellent starters! Everyone ordered different selections from the vast menu, so we had everything from pizza, burgers, chicken and biscuits, Santa fe salad ( which was massive, plenty left-over for tomorrow), four cheese penned, chicken di pana - all served at the same time and hot! Of course, the cheesecake selection was over the top, again very very good. Great food, clean and neat seating area and very friendly, professional staff. Thank you Cheesecake Factory for making our birthday event special."
Ben W.,"New York, NY",449,757,434,3.0,1/5/2013,"Food makes the experience for me. Unfortunately, Cheesecake did not make the cut. From what my parents tell me, this place is always bustling and there's always a wait. Luckily, we were able to get a table right when we walked in on an early Friday afternoon. Out server Jackie was very friendly and immediately brought a basket of bread and took down our drink orders (even though we're just a water and lemon family). With our cold waters and piping-hot bread and butter in hand, we decided to tackle our next order of business: the menu. Now, I have seen lots of menus in my lifetime. However, I think this place tops the list as far as how many items it has. Spiral-bound and about 16 pages longs, there's plenty of choices for almost any palate. While this is a huge plus for large groups, this completely overwhelmed me. Sadly Yelp didn't have too many food suggestions and I was faced with making a decision between 20 different types of chicken and 15 types of burgers, just to name a few. I decided to go with the Grilled Shrimp and Bacon Club with Sweet Potato Fries. The rest of the family ordered the Cajun Blackened Shrimp, the Navajo with fries, and the Mushroom Burger with salad greens. Unfortunately, there was quite a long wait time for our dishes, closing in on about 25 minutes before they came out. I think it was because of the timing of cooking the dishes, because three out of four of our plates (the physical plates) were scalding hot, as if they had been sitting on a hot plate for a while. Presentation wise, I liked how the dishes were arranged. The two sandwiches had their fries in a nice silvery steel cup. The shrimp dish had everything in their own neat piles and it was very visually appealing. The burger even looked especially nice, with grilled mushrooms and cheese oozing off the sides. Unfortunately, my club sandwich was wayyyy too oily. All three slices of bread were soaked through with butter and the special dressing in combination led to an omg-I-can't-finish-the-second-half-because-it's-just-oily/rich situation.  The shrimp was also slightly overcooked and tough to eat through. I ended up taking apart the second half of the sandwich and just eating the shrimp and potatoes. The sweet potatoe fries were also disappointing. While my plate burning hot, the fries were barely warm. Also, the majority of them were over-fried, so it seemed more like thin sweet potato chips than fries. Overall, not impressed. The other dishes were hit-and-miss. The burger was probably my favorite. My mom asked for medium rare and it was cooked perfectly. The bun and toppings with it led to a decent burger. However, the salad had too much dressing and the greens were soggy. I didn't try the Navajo, but the fries were very good. Crispy but still meaty on the insides. And hot. The shrimp was not to my liking, but my brother was enjoying it. It was just too sweet for me. Also, the rice was a little dry. However, the mango salsa helped me with cutting through the oil of my sandwich. My brother and I split a Chocolate Raspberry Truffle slice of cheesecake. While the namesake, neither of us were too impressed. The biggest complaint was the chocolate ganache on top: not only was it rock hard, but it tasted like chocolate buttercream frosting more so than ganache. Tip: don't try and eat a whole slice by yourself: it's very dense and enough for two. I found the interior to be a little tacky, but the buzz and environment was pretty good. They have a small barrier between the bar and restaurant areas, but the buzz still carried through the air and you could just feel the energy of the place. Also, the service was spot on. Our server was very attentive, knowledgeable, and willing to hold a small conversation. My dad also noted that on his way to and from the bathroom, every single server he passed smiled at him. A+ on that on, Cheesecake Factory! Overall, I had a poor experience because my food wasn't great. However, if you don't mind paying more for mediocre food in exchange for great service and a lively environment, this is the place for you. Pros: menu variety, attentive/friendly service, environment, menu variety (needed to be said twice) Cons: food too oily/not too exciting, speediness of food delivery Dishes to try: Mushroom Burger Dishes to skip: Grilled Shrimp and Bacon Club, Sweet Potato Fries"
Michael N.,"Rochester, NY",48,102,,4.0,8/9/2016,"We just love the food and the service here at the Cheesecake Factory....From the moment you walk in you feel like you're someplace exotic almost Vegas like in the splendor of the room decore...I personally enjoy the Thai Lettuce wraps, which is so big I eat it as my main meal....Let me tell you it's HUGE....The prices aren't too bad but not cheap either and given the quality I gladly pay for it....Now the Cheesecake part is to die for, yup it's worth taking home a doggie bag just to save room for the lovely desert and so many to choose from, that's the hard part....All in all this place rocks!!!!"
Eileen R.,"Tranquillity, CA",0,5,,2.0,1/26/2017,Ordered bacon burger for lunch. Burger was just fair & fries were luke warm. I find it hard to believe a chain restaurant like Cheesecake Factory doesn't offer their patrons free wi-fi? For the prices for drinks and food that should be a minimum expectation.
Patricia C.,"Azusa, CA",61,141,51,1.0,4/11/2014,"We came a couple of months back for a birthday brunch. This was probably the worst Cheesecake Factory experience I've ever had. Mind you, I've gone to a handful of Cheesecake Factories (all over California and then some) and this was, by far, the worst customer experience ever. We were seated for brunch almost immediately. The hostess led us past all of the empty table to the back of the room. We did not mind until 30 minutes later, not one waiter came by to take our order or to introduce their self to us. I had to get out of my seat and stand in the aisle before I caught a server and asked to be moved to a different table. She gave me a look and said she would need to talk to the hostess. After many conversations between the hostess, server, and our actual server, we were finally moved to a table closer to the middle of the restaurant (where everyone else was sitting). But of course, this was not after having unnecessary and rude comments thrown at us. We could also clearly see the employees bad-mouthing us a few tables down simply because we asked to be seated at a table where it would be easier to get attention. Our new waitress introduced herself to us with a sour face. We politely ordered food and drinks and she went on her way. Our waitress switched off with another and went on a break. Our new and third waitress originally also portrayed a flat affect. However, over the course of our meal we were able to win her over. She was sweet and helpful with everything we asked for. The food itself was good. Not mind-blowing but you can never really go wrong with Cheesecake Factory food. However, I prefer the dinner foods here more. There was absolutely no reason for the employees there to treat us the way we did. We only asked to change tables and when we did, we did so with a ""please"" and ""thank you"". Not once did we give attitude despite the numerous glares, sour faces, and snide comments. And honestly, it's not like Cheesecake Factory is top-tier and has the right to be snobby like they were. I only say this because I've worked in the food industry - it's your job to provide excellent customer service, even if you're having a crappy morning for one reason or another."
Vada C.,"Camarillo, CA",0,3,,5.0,1/21/2017,"It was a busy night so we snagged a spot at a bar table, and were immediately greeted by an awesome server, Matt. Drinks were great, food was stellar, and we were informed about happy hour m-f 4-6. We will be back"
Joe C.,"Fairport, NY",0,22,,1.0,7/6/2016,Voted one of America's Top Unhealthiest Chain Restaurants. Enough said just look around!
Jacob B.,"West Henrietta, NY",40,66,14,4.0,9/28/2015,Great atmosphere / classy clientele / polite wait staff / seated quickly / very clean establishment / everything I've ordered has always been delicious  9/10 would def recommend
Patrick F.,"Ontario, NY",0,11,1,2.0,6/26/2016,Waited at least 40 minutes after ordering for the food to arrive. Food was nothing special and nothing that I would go out of my way to get. Will not be dinning here again.
Resa B.,"Hyattsville, MD",0,8,,1.0,12/1/2016,"I went here with a party of about 10 for a birthday dinner last night. Let me just say that the ONLY thing thatwas good was the server, he was amazing. first off the drinks, we ordered magaritas and they were heavily iced and watered down it was absolutely disgusting, most of us didnt even finish. I thought it was a fluke and asked for a long island iced tea,hmm HUGE mistake it was again full of ice in a small glass and just basically water and soda. Its just a huge rip off when you spend $8.50 and $10.50 for a drink. Since my drinks were horrible I decided to just get buffalo wings I mean how can you go wrong , while one of my cousins got their tater tots. My wings were the WORST wings I have ever had. They were so small and there was so much soggy gross sauce that it just tasted as though I was eating lemons. My cousin took a bit into her tater tots and there was a hair entangled into the mixture. She immediately sent them back! I dont like cheesecake but i got a take home slice for my husband and from what EI gathered from my family members who ate a slice there is that it wasnt even cold... -_-. like really? what a rip off, what a waste of money! I should of just stayed home and saved $45 since it was plain crap! DO NOT GO THERE!"
Mary C.,"Plano, TX",5,38,4,2.0,4/29/2016,I got a caesar salad and the dressing was disgusting. It tasted like it had wasabi and it was very bland. The appetizer size costed $10. Thank goodness the waiter talked me out of getting the entree sized. I didn't even more than three bites. The waiting staff is very friendly. That's the only redeeming quality of the place.
Kenneth F.,"Geneva, NY",48,92,131,3.0,12/15/2014,"This is the first time coming to this location and business since we moved here from the west coast. My parents got us gift cards and we looked forward to this. We arrived and were seated quickly (it wasn't busy). We knew we wanted the avocado egg rolls because they are delicious (sweet and creamy, plus avocados cost a lot in NY). We ordered 2 strawberry lemonades (very sweet and yummy). My wife ordered orange chicken and I decided to order Pit Beef Dip (the description sounds awesome). Well we received our appetizer and bread but it seemed to take a while to get our entrees. I couldn't wait to bite into this steak and caramelized onions with the cheese and dipping sauce. As my eyes looked upon my food I could see thick cuts of onion not caramelized and pretty pink looking meat. I took a bite and almost ALL the meat came out. It was a big blob of fatty chewy disgust. It tasted as if the meat wasn't cooked enough and I immediately took it out of my mouth and pushed the plate to the end of the table. I couldn't even eat the fries, WAY to much salt.  Our waitress finally came back and asked if something was wrong (hence the whole plate not eaten) and I told her it was a disgusting mess and to please take away. She asked if I wanted something else instead and so I thought of something fast and basic they couldn't screw up so I ordered a basic cheeseburger. I had fun getting to watch my wife eat her food and then when my burger came she got to watch me. The burger was juicy and good for a 11.00 burger. We ended up not getting cheesecake or dessert after this. They comp'd the dog chew sandwich and I ended up paying for the cheeseburger (a 2.00 difference).  We won't be back for a long time. It was just a bad choice I guess and I suggest no one else order it. True disgust."
Nicole W.,"Spencerport, NY",3,54,4,3.0,2/7/2015,"Everything is so... How do I put this....mediocre-ly average! Blah blah and blah.  You go here when there are no other options and you want something consistently average, and dare I say...dependable?  Found part of a wrapper from a stick of butter in my entree, but alas, we got a free slice of cheesecake!   I also don't hate a couple things off of their ""skinnylicious"" menu, but I guess that doesn't say much.  Also, meals under 590 calories with 590 being the ceiling seems like a tad much for such a ""skinny"" menu.  And for the love of God, can the staff not be mandated to wear all white!?! What kind of regime is this?!"
Christoff J.,"Rochester, NY",60,67,219,4.0,11/2/2014,"After returning from living in the San Francisco Bay Area, I wanted to enjoy a taste of Rochester and decided for some Cheesecake Factory. The wait on a Sunday night wasn't as bad (quoted 20 minutes) but in reality we waited 30 minutes for a table. It was odd that they would bring out warm bread with cold frozen packets of butter; I'm confused how I am suppose to cut into and apply frozen butter. Nevertheless, the drinks and meals were good and the waitress was decent.  Intially, she was high energy and friendly but by the end of the meal, she was quite and seemed like she was ready for us to leave. I will return and hope for soft butter."
Dale F.,"Hertford, NC",3,236,151,4.0,9/11/2014,"Wow it's our first time and it's over-the-top. Big menu lots of choices, fast prompt service. Excellent food, big portions, Great interior over-the-top a palace to itself. Little on the pricey side but well worth it. Can't wait for our next visit."
David K.,"Rochester, NY",2,11,,2.0,11/16/2015,"Went there on Saturday 11/14th with a party of 10 people.  We arrived at 1:30pm and were seated around 2:15pm.  It took 1/2 hour just to get our (non-alcoholic) drinks.  We placed our food orders at the same time as our drink orders.  It took another 45 minutes to get our food after getting our drinks.  None of the people at my end of the table were too thrilled with the food.  The burgers were small, dry and served on an over sized bun.  The french fries were way to salty.  My friends Chicken and biscuits looked horrible.  The chicken was dry like cardboard, and the vegetables looked like something out of a can thats been sitting in the fridge for a few weeks.  Another ordered the Falafel Salad, she said it was very spicy and barely ate any of it.  When mentioned to the server, she basically shrugged her shoulders.  After finishing what we could, it was another 1/2 hour trying to track down someone to give us our checks. The last time I was here was about a year ago.  The food and service was much better last time.  Based on this visit, it'll be unlikely that I come here again."
Robert S.,"Rochester, NY",3,3,1,1.0,2/20/2016,"Very slow service. Menu much too large to indicate fresh food preparation. Appetizer arrived after entrees, we sent it back."
