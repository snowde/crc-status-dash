Nakeeta W.,"New York, NY",22,96,8,2.0,6/10/2015,"Went there with my nieces for dinner.  Overall the service was very poor.   The hostesses were busy chatting when we entered.  Waiter didnt tell us the specials.  (Although I heard him telling the next table).  He didnt offer dessert either.   We had to ask for high chairs for the babies.  The food was medoicre.  I pride this chain because the food is usually plated so beautifully.   Not at this one.  It was cold and tasted funny.  I wondered why no one suggested going before.   I didn't know it was one in Rochester. I see why.  Never again.  Two stars because the waiter was hot and the food wasn't slow.  Ive been to this chain in nj, yonkers, ny; dc..all much busier and a better experience. ...may I suggest trainers come again. ..front and back of the house."
Marisa P.,"Rochester, NY",124,18,,2.0,2/28/2016,"Came here for my sisters birthday waited for a half hour but expected it for a Saturday night, we all ordered our food at the same time and my mom and dad got their food first then my sisters came out I waited about 10 min for my food to come out, was very disappointed about this, but the steak I got was veryyy good I tried my moms while I was waiting and hers was very good too."
Brandy H.,"Farmington, NY",0,6,,2.0,8/26/2016,"We were here on Tuesday 8/23. Food was good, but the service was SLOOOOW. Our table of 4 was held hostage by their slow service for 1hr 45 min...far too long with 2 kids, in my opinion!"
Kate J.,"Charlotte, NC",10,171,43,1.0,10/27/2014,"My mom and I went to lunch here today because she always wanted to try it and we were in the area.  I live out of town and have always had great experiences at The Cheesecake Factory in our area. We were seated at around 3pm, and were some of the only patrons in the restaurant.  The bartender was our server because of where we were seated.  She greeted us, got our drinks and then never returned for over ten minutes.  She then finally took our order, and we did not see her again until the food came- which took TWENTY MINUTES- for two burgers.  She never stopped in to tell us she was checking on our order or anything- we were completely ignored.  When she brought the food, I mentioned how it took a long time, and she agreed.  She must've mentioned it to the manager who came over and said they overcooked our burger so they had to make it a second time.  I understand and was a server for a period of time- that these things happen in restaurants.  BUT, communication with your guests make it a lot less, well awkward for you in the long run as a server.  She should've said they made a mistake and please be patient.  Or, the manager should've done so as we were waiting for so long.  She never came back except to bring us our check.  Again, at this point, we were the only ones we could see in the entire restaurant!  No excuse here.  We were going to get dessert but at this point just wanted to get out of there. We were not looking for anything free, but after a bad experience- one to the point the server felt the manager was necessary- they could've offered something- 10% off, a free dessert...something.  She should have made some sort of gesture to smooth it over.  This would've saved a bad impression for my mom, who was a first time diner.  Instead, we won't be back.  :("
Mike M.,"Rochester, NY",39,126,98,1.0,5/20/2015,"Let me premise this review what the fact that I rarely go to chain restaurant's when I want a nice meal. I find compared to locally owned and operated options they have inferior food, cooked less originally, by frugally trained chefs, who hand the food off to waitresses who could rarely give a crap. Now that being said, my fiancé recently lamented the fact that she had never had the chance to try visit Cheesecake Factory, so I thought we'd give it a try. Although my expectations were low, I was willing to give it a chance.   We were taken to a table shortly after we arrived, it was just the two of us. Our table was a half booth half table and my fiancé inquired where I wanted to sit. I told her I'd be on the inside as the table are more or less on top of one another and you're sitting shoulder to shoulder with your neighbor. We wouldn't want to sacrifice a little space for some ambiance right guys? Praise the almighty dollar! I knew she'd be a bit claustrophobic so I said I'd sit inside. Now mind you, I'm 6'3"" and don't fit well in small places but that's what us gentlemen do for our ladies. Our waitress had this to comment, to my Fiancé "" Oh don't feel bad, my butt can't fit back their either"".... WTF? DO you have train them or just give them an apron and tell them to ""Go at it!"" ?   So moving on we began to explore your menus. We noticed that they are quite large and you offer an impressive amount of dishes. Here's the thing though, well two things. One, when it comes to food, less can be more. There is no way you actually have a staff with the experience to cook a dozen varieties of cuisine well! You just don't. Secondly is this. Specialty is defined as ""a pursuit, area of study, or skill to which someone has devoted much time and effort and in which they are expert."" That doesn't apply to any food you turn out and it definitely does not describe 3/4 of your menu even though you claim they are all specialties.   We settled on the crab and artichoke dip, Cajun Fried Catfish and Herb Roasted Chicken. When our waitress returned we informed her of our order. I had also noticed a chicken and biscuit dish on the menu. I admitted it may be a little unusual but I told her I'd like to order some biscuits as well. Her immediate and unwavering response was ""No."" Not ""let me check with my manager"" not ""Let me check for you"" just ""No."" With no explanation or reason why. So I of coarse ask why not? She informed I just wasn't allowed to. And that's all she would say. Again, do you even train your staff? At all?   Our first encounter with food was our Crab and Artichoke dip, it had a decent flavor, no actual crab that we could find, but it was ok. It was delivered by someone who was not our server as she was somewhere else doing something else. About this time I was wishing for my biscuits and I notice that every other table in sight has bread on it. Now after asking around I found out that bread should have been brought early in the meal but apparently our server just didn't give a crap. Even when she properly defended the magic biscuits that corporate says the customer is not allowed to have ""because."" Wouldn't someone with half a brain say  "" Hey, what a minute, I can't give you the magic nom nom biscuits of deliciousness because.... BUT I could bring you some delightful bread and butter?"" But no, that didn't happen. Why? Inept, poorly trained staff.   So eventually our entrées come, they were delivered by someone who was not our server as again she was somewhere else doing something else. SO we try it. Let's start with the good. The mashed potatoes were very very edible. I'm not going to claim they were in my top 20 but they are mashed potatoes, you did OK. Good job. Second the shake and bake chicken was a bit dry but again, it was edible. Boring, and sad that it is something you claim to have ""a pursuit, area of study, or skill to which someone has devoted much time and effort and in which they are expert."" But ok. The green beans where cold, still in their canned water and utterly devoid of anything to even resemble seasoning. Lastly the Piece de resistance. The Cajun Fried Catfish. Has anyone you employee ever actually eaten Cajun food or real Cajun catfish? Your biggest flaws were the COMPLETE lack of any seasonings on the ""CAJUN"" catfish, the fact it was cold (this is very bad) and lastly it was in no way crispy. Your tartar sauce was somewhat Cajun flavored. However, I did not order plan catfish with Cajun tartar sauce, did I?   Oh by the way, not to worry. Our waitress did eventually show back up. She let us know she had been using the bathroom for the last 30 minutes but was ""super sorry"" she hadn't ya know, brought us any food or every checked in with us to see if it was ok. The one positive was that this did help enforce to the fiancé why we don't go to chain restaurants for nice meals."
Michael M.,"Rochester, NY",18,70,1,2.0,7/24/2016,"I debated between 1 and 2 stars and settled on 2 as the service was friendly albeit slow and incompetent and not all of the food was disgusting. I ordered a special - pan seared salmon with broccoli and mashed potatoes. The sides were decent (the mashed potatoes had the taste and consistency of being hand mashed) and the salmon was well-prepared although strangely covered in sliced mushrooms that really did nothing to complement the salmon. This dish was in sharp contrast with the repulsive pasta Alfredo dish off of the children's menu.  The Alfredo sauce (presumably the same as offered on the regular menu) tasted like brine. My child said it was ok, probably not wanting me to cause embarrassment by sending back -- which in retrospect I should have as it was uneaten. The other children's dishes (noodles and butter- something that is hard to ruin) were fine (and enough to share with the unfortunate sibling stuck with bow tie pasta covered in pickle juice). The meatballs that came with the pasta were nothing special and undoubtedly not made fresh. I actually like their cheesecakes a lot (although I understand the perspective of the purists who don't believe they qualify as cheesecake). So no complaints there. The sundaes off the children's menu are overpriced for what you get.  The service was awkward. It wasn't slow (except for refilling water which I desperately needed after eating just one of those bow ties) but simply not good. For example she cleared some plates but left a bunch uncleared after taking our dessert order. A while later a manager (?) walked by and asked if he could clear some plates. After he grabbed a couple I piled up what was left and put in the corner of he table expecting the waitress to return to get them. When she brought the dessert (with all of the silverware and plates packed into the corner of the table) I asked if we could get some forks and spoons and have the dirty plates and silverware cleared. She did bring silverware but we were stuck with the dirty plates and silverware on the table until after we left. I assume they cleared them off before they sat the next party. I don't think I will return other than maybe to get a slice of ""cheesecake"" to go."
Stanley M.,"Pittsford, NY",179,480,2071,4.0,9/9/2013,"It took me a while to warm up to the Cheesecake Factory in Pittsford; ever since it's arrival it has come to dominate Pittsford Plaza. I can see why Wilmorite courted the restaurant chain... it is a HUGE traffic builder & destination restaurant. On some nights the wait is so long you'll think you're in Henrietta...   Due to it's proximity, we dine there frequently. My daughter loves the Shrimp & Bacon Club Sandwich, and my son digs the Factory Burger. My better half routinely orders from the Skinnylicious menu while I try to navigate through the menu to find FODMAP compatible food. On our last visit our server informed us that a new gluten free menu was in the works. Let's hope the additions will be as palatable as the rest of the menu.  One of my only beefs about the restaurant is that the regular menu items are immense! Big enough for sharing with one (or two) people.  Of course, no meal is complete without ordering one of the many varieties of cheesecake... it's like going to an ice cream parlor.  All in all, pretty good for a chain restaurant. I've been to other Cheesecake Factories in other locales and this one is the best so far. As always, YMMV & objects in the mirror are closer than they appear!"
Gillian N.,"Rochester, NY",6,19,13,4.0,9/16/2015,"Had a fabulous time. The cocktails were delicious and the food was on point. We had a party of 10 so has 2 waitresses who were both phenomenal. The book-for-a menu aside, everything was great.  They even made an exception and took my reservations on a Saturday which they don't usually do but I was very appreciative because of or large party."
Rachel A.,"Ladson, SC",53,15,5,3.0,5/6/2015,The food is pretty good and the cheesecake is good. Nothing spectacular about it. A little over priced. If you're looking for consistency this is a good place to go. If you're looking to be WOWed I would suggest somewhere else. Try one of the local restaurant.
Reviewer L.,"Rochester, NY",0,13,,4.0,1/17/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory is a great choice if your looking for someplace to eat but you don't want anything to fancy. Every once in a while my family and I go to the Cheesecake Factory. My favorite thing to get at the Cheesecake Factory is the mac and cheese which has a crispy crumb coated macaroni and cheese. My favorite thing about this restaurant is their cheesecake, which is what they are known for. There cheesecake is the best cheesecake I've ever had! My favorite kinds of cheesecake are the Reese's Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake Cheesecake, the Brownie Fudge Cheesecake, the Key Lime Cheesecake, and the Snickers Bar Chunks cheesecake!  The Reese's Peanut Butter cheesecake has Reese's peanut butter cups in our original cheesecake with layers of delicious fudge cake and caramel! The Key Lime Cheesecake has key lime pie in a cheesecake; it is deliciously tart and creamy on a vanilla crumb crust! The Brownie Fudge cheesecake is a walnut-brownie cheesecake and white chocolate mousse covered with hot fudge and almonds. The one thing that I don't like about the cheesecake is how rich and filling it is. After a big meal of theirs it is very hard to finish a cheesecake on top of what you just ate! The service at the restaurant is okay depending on how crowded it is. If it is really crowded they are slower than usual, but if it is not crowed the normally will come within a few minutes after you get seated. The food takes a good 20-30 mins to come after you order. The food there can be very expensive depending on what you order. The cheesecake can be expensive also, because it is so rich and delicious."
Mel M.,"Philadelphia, PA",355,87,112,3.0,4/11/2014,"It is surprisingly quiet here at this time on a Friday night.  I came here for an early solo celebration for my birthday and to recover from some serious retail therapy. I ordered the combination plate with Steak Diane and the famous chicken dish which were both really good. Everyone knows that the CF is known for giving you a ton of food, but this plate was well balanced.  Another know thing is how warm and soft the bread is. I, for one, love the ""brown bread"". It is some type of wheat bread with crack oats... it's addicting. I was told to wait as they were waiting for a new batch to come from the oven. That was a lie, the batch my waitress brought me was stale and crusty, which is not typical of CF bread. When I asked for a new batch, she brought me bread that felt the same way, which I did not like. I am assuming that they had some old bread they were trying to get rid of or the bakers didn't know what s/he was doing.  I ordered the same cheesecake I always do, the plain with fresh strawberries. They never cease to disappoint. I normally do not have a sweet tooth, but when I do, it is extremely particular, and I am glad that CF hit the right spot."
Kristina M.,"Rochester, NY",0,11,2,1.0,1/9/2016,Where to begin...I picked the cheese cake factory to celebrate my 25th birthday with my husband last night. Neither of us had ever been so we were excited to go! We already knew it would be pretty busy being a Friday night. People waiting were just piled at the front door waiting for their table pagers to go off. After FINALLY guessing and finding the hostess booth there were ONLY TWO hostess..stood there for a second waiting for one of the girls to look up and ask how they could help or how many in my party. Two seconds later another lady barges past me and ask how long of a wait...thanks. So unfortunately we turned around and walked out.
Nicole S.,"Phelps, NY",2,36,22,5.0,9/21/2014,Everything was really good! The food was delicious and the waitresses were pleasant. FYI for those that go and experience having two waitresses while the first one goes on their lunch break. No need to tip the replacement as they are paid an hourly rate to cover for waitresses while their on break. Learn something new every day. Personally we enjoyed the replacement better. Highly recommend the red velvet and Adams PB Cup cheesecake!
Brandon T.,"Ontario County, NY",11,10,7,1.0,5/31/2014,"One of the worst experiences I've ever had. Overly expensive food that was not worth it. The menu is over 16 pages long, and there is a second menu I didn't even get a chance to look at because our waitress was rushing us to order.  I ordered the chicken parm, however when I received it it was a bland piece of chicken stuffed between a loaf of garlic bread that was smothered in butter. It was terrible and impossible to eat. I couldn't even eat just the chicken.  There seemed to be no specific sections for the waiters. We had 4 different waiters in our section and when we asked one to get our waiter they had no idea who it was serving us. When our waitress eventually did come back around to check on us 20 minutes later, she was nice enough to offer to replace my parm but by then we were ready to leave. Overly dark setting, we had to use our phones to look at dirty plates and silverware. The lights looked like the eye from lord of the rings. The place felt like an attraction or theme park.  Would not go again."
Joley B.,"Rochester, NY",17,408,416,3.0,4/12/2014,"I had a terrible experience here years ago when it first opened.  I hated my dish - it was terrible.   Something about it wasn't right, there was no effort to make something different, and it was my birthday dinner so I was really annoyed.  I think I may have cried afterwards because everyone ate and loved their food, and I was hungry. Needless to say - I hadn't been back until a few weeks ago when a friend suggested it for lunch prior to catching a movie at the Pittsford Theater. I managed to get a decent parking space - but it was INSANE.  I sat in my car for a few minutes waiting for my friend and there were at least 5 cars that stopped, put their turn signal on, and wait for my spot.  I waved two away, ignored two, and then got out when the 5th figured they too had scored a decent space. I can't believe how busy this place is even at 2:30 in the afternoon. We were crammed into a two person table near a sidewall, and the poor gentlemen were forced to listen to girls only conversation.  Sorry! For my meal I started with a cup of soup - baked potato.  It's a meal in and of itself.  I  really only ate that and a piece of baguette.  I had also ordered the Kale and Quinoa salad.  The salad was delicious to be honest, and I was quite pleased with it.  I didn't eat much until lunch the next day, because I wasn't going to take soup home, and I was too full anyways. The Kale and Quinoa was excellent.  Honestly, I hadn't enjoyed kale in quite some time, and this was delicious.  Light and fresh, there was just enough quinoa to balance with the kale, and the sunflower seeds were a great addition.  I was inspired by this dish to recreate the salad at home, and I'm quite grateful for that - for it is much cheaper and just as tasty. I am inclined to come back again if someone else suggests it as a place they'd like to go.  With such a big menu, its good to know I like something on it!"
Theresa R.,"Buffalo, NY",190,499,151,5.0,6/7/2014,"I'm never one to choose a chain restaurant but I had a work lunch meeting here.  I was so impressed.  Delicious appetizers. ..fried mac/cheese balls and avocado egg rolls.  Then the ""Lunch sized"" bbq chicken salad was awesome and large enough for me to have it as dinner too. I ordered an iced tea and surprised to be given a selection of flavors. ..I went with passion fruit. Service was great too.  Could come here everyday of the year and probably try something different each time. ..menu is HUGE."
Tina W.,"Oneida, NY",83,20,,5.0,10/3/2015,Love the Cheesecake!!!  Oh yes!  But so much more deliciousness here!  Try something new every time and they never disappoint!  Servers and staff are always courteous and professional.
Emily W.,"Chicago, IL",38,9,40,4.0,5/15/2015,"Came for dinner with my boyfriend and our service was great. Ordered our drinks, which were nice and strong (Whiskey Smash and Ultimate Margarita) and our meals came to our table quickly. My boyfriend ordered a medium rare Filet Mignon with mashed potatoes and green beans -- he loved it. I was on a salad kick so I ordered the Pear and Endive salad from the Skinnylicious menu, which was really tasty and filling! Topped off our meals with two Extreme Oreo cheesecakes :) Overall, we had a great experience and we will come back again!"
Kristen O.,"Trenton, NJ",76,193,30,2.0,1/27/2012,"This place is OK but not really anything to rave about. The food is always just so-so but really the only reason worth the visit is the cheesecake.  I went with a large group of people and I ordered the asian lettuce wraps. On the menu it only came with chicken but since I don't eat chicken I asked for them to make it in shrimp. The waitress had no idea how much extra it would cost for them to add in the shrimp (I think they ended up adding 3 or 4 dollars on for 6 pieces of shrimp-rip off) but I ordered it anyway. There was still pieces of the shell on the shrimp which was really unappetizing and made the texture really weird. Yuck. The dipping sauces were clearly straight from a container or bottle and tasted so-so. When it came time to order the cheesecake, they woudn't even let us eat it in the restaurant, they brought it out in to-go boxes because I guess we were too close to closing time to eat it there? There was plenty of time to eat it before they closed but oh well. I ended up eating the Oreo cheesecake the next day and it was pretty good but nothing special. Probably won't go back to this place. Overpriced ($20-$25 for a soft beverage, small dinner, and dessert) and not even that good tasting of food."
Luis M.,"Lake Forest, CA",48,15,,4.0,4/12/2015,"This location was phenomenal!! Service and food was incredibly great!  My wife had  Chicken Breast Charbroiled with Teriyaki Sauce, Served with Steamed Rice and i had the Miso Marinated Salmon Served with Snow Peas, White Rice and a incredibly delicious Miso Sauce and my GOD WAS IT GOOD! We topped it off with Red Velvet cheesecake.  Only gripe i have is with all the ads in the menu, other than that small nuisance, check out this location!"
