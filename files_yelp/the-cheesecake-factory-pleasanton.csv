Desi B.,"Livermore, CA",35,127,537,4.0,1/9/2018,"Per usual this place always hits the spot. Came here for my birthday celebration just me and bae. Nice to know they are open until 11PM on a weekday. Wasn't sure what to expect on a Monday but it was nice to see it was not that busy like it typically is.  We were instantly greeted and seated. The server was very attentive and prompt at delivering our orders and checking on us.  I ordered the Bistro shrimp pasta, which I have had in the past and this time is was just as good if not better. I asked for extra sauce and they delivered. Bae got the jambalaya pasta with shrimp and chicken, extra spicy. From his comments I can tell he loved his meal as well.  They also surprised me with a birthday sundae and sang Happy Birthday. Which was a nice ending to an already great day!  The one star I didn't add only because it was raining outside and if I didn't take the precaution to walk carefully in the restaurant I felt I would have slipped and fell. I think they should think about adding a carpet or something to absorb the water as people walk in."

Josephine D.,"Fremont, CA",53,46,29,1.0,1/2/2018,"This review is not about the food because their food is always on point but this is for their awful customer service. Yes, it's Cheesecake Factory.  Wait is always long anywhere you go.  I get it.   However when I am told that the wait is for 40 minutes, give or take 40 minutes we should be able to get our table.  If it's longer than 40 minutes, the restaurant should be honest with their customers to let them know that the wait is longer.  40 minutes came and went without our buzzer going off.  When my son came up to ask about the status of our table, he was told that a table is being cleaned and we should be up next in less than 5 minutes.  10 minutes pass with no buzzer.  I went up to the desk to ask again, and the girl at the desk said there's no one available to bus the table.  Wait ... that's not what you said 10 minutes ago!  Then the manager calls my son, not me, to show him that there are 7 other guests ahead of us.  So wait ... that's not what the girl said!  I asked the manager how long is the wait.  He said they misquoted their guests and it really was an hour and 15.  Wow ... I'm no math genius but 40 minutes and 1.15 hours are totally different!   The manager's name is Sammy, or so I was told.  He even had the audacity to say ""stick around the food is good!""  No shit Sherlock!  That's why we're here because we like the food.  Your customer service however leaves much to be desired! Their saving grace is Mejamin, our wait staff for the night.  He was on point and was HONEST when he told us that he was running behind but wanted to make sure that he checked if we needed anything.  That was no thanks to Sammy the Manager!  Thank goodness for awesome wait staff - we even forgot how awful the front desk was. Yes Sammy - we know the food is good.  I just wish you also know what to tell your customers about  the wait times.  Your front desk needs an overhaul."
Karen L.,"San Leandro, CA",174,177,1130,4.0,12/4/2017,"I've been a fan of The Cheesecake Factory for years. I never wrote a review because I wasn't a serious Yelper back then but I am now! Lol. So, this location is at Stoneridge Mall; there is a spacious parking lot but it gets pretty full. On this visit, my bf and I ordered the: Fried Chicken & Waffles Benedict - $13.95 Loaded Baked Potato Tots - $6.95 The fried chicken wasn't the best I've ever had but decent. The potato tots were good. Our waitress pointed out that they're fried tots (she someone got upset with her once since the description showed ""baked""). The service here for me has been good so far. I also recommend their Louisiana Chicken Pasta, Carbonara & Crispy Crab Bites."
Linh N.,"San Francisco, CA",78,78,135,2.0,12/17/2017,"My friend and I came here recently for my late birthday dinner and ordered the Miso Salmon because a friend raved about it and suggested subbing the rice for mashed potatoes/ ordering extra sauce. We got this and an appetizer to share. The description of the Miso Salmon on their website says it's ""Fresh Miso Marinated Salmon Served with Snow Peas, White Rice and a Delicious Miso Sauce"". The photo shows a nice and caramelized/browned piece of salmon over a bed of rice, which was how we hoped our meal would look as well (but with mashed potatoes instead of rice). It took FOREVER to come out. The people who sat next to us and arrived after us received four entrees before we even got anything. The waitress finally brought us our food after saying ""it looks like your food just popped out"", and unfortunately it was cold and the mashed potatoes were served in a separate bowl. Also the salmon was super pink and didn't look caramelized at all. Bleh... it was so disappointing. I'll stick to what I normally order next time- Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta. It never fails."
K H.,"San Lorenzo, CA",19,89,2,1.0,1/7/2018,Well I have been violently sick for 36 hours and the last thing I consumed was the fish and chips at your location. Rancid tarter sauce or fish really have created havoc and you can count me out from ever coming there again based on how sick I got on Friday.
A T.,"Dublin, CA",227,120,146,2.0,1/7/2018,"I love Cheesecake Factory, however they are absolutely horrible at curbside pick up. # 1 food is barely ready on time. #2 they have specific parking spaces for pick up, however they are always full. So when the spots are full I call in and will usually let the store know I am parked in front and describe my vehicle, that's if I don't get placed on hold for 15 mins or hung up on. Which has happened every time now that I order pick up. After tonight it got to the point where I had to actually go into the restaurant stand in line and wait for my food. But while waiting in this insane line I noticed the manager who I went up to and explain my situation and that this is not the first time. The manager was really nice and gave me my order for free. So the manager was nice and really tried to make things right. However due to this continuing service with curbside pick up, I will never pick up an order from here again."
Leslie Y.,"San Francisco, CA",245,650,585,4.0,9/30/2017,"Who doesn't like CF?..... Our last visit was delicious as usual, we tried something different....Mac n cheese balls, definitely worth a try if you are a cheese fan... My all-time favorite is still the chicken Madeira, don't forget to ask for the extra Madeira sauce, you won't regret it.... Pasta is always a tad dry here, extra sauce is a given, ask...."
Renee S.,"Fremont, CA",142,37,23,3.0,12/10/2017,"Visited Cheesecake after shopping at the Livermore Outlet on a Sunday night. Was seated within 30 mins for two, just ten more mins than estimated.  Once we were seated, our waiter came in about ten minutes later to take our order. He took our drinks and appetizer and brought us our drinks and appetizers after 15 mins. However, our bread did not come, as they were still in the process of baking.  The bread comes back, however we only get sourdough and didn't not receive the whole wheat bread, as we were told it would get to us. Also noted we were offered olive oil and vinegar for the bread, but that was forgotten too. 30-45 mins pass by and we get our food, cold. The food was already ready to be delivered, however it was forgotten to be taken our table. I was asked if I wanted Parmesan on my pasta and I said yes, however 15-20 mins pass by and I never got any. A few bites in, I was ready to pack up and close the check.  We figured to buy the cake at the entrance, and another mistake... instead of the coffee cheesecake I was given Chocolate cake when I was ready to devour it at home.  Overall during this 2hr dine in:  Food was still great, however served a bit cold.  Server was very sweet and nice, yet seemed like he had a long day and needed more assistance and was pacing through several tables... as we didn't receive many of the things we hoped for.  Was given the wrong order of cheesecake, better yet just normal cake."
Marshal R.,"Fremont, CA",107,242,27,1.0,11/4/2017,It'll be an hour wait... It'll be 30 min.... It'll be 5 min..... It'll be another 30 min.... Seriously? I understand we had a large party and it can be difficult to guess the times but give us worse than predicted time so that we can make up our mind before we waste an hour of our time with 2 kids and a crying toddler.  Completely unacceptable and the manager didn't seem all that apologetic. I won't be returning.
Ty C.,"San Francisco, CA",67,327,144,1.0,7/30/2017,"I've been here dozens of times, most without an issue. I'm not sure how I haven't left a review previously, but the experience today has prompted me to do so.  We found bar seating and had to wait for 5 mins or so to have the table wiped down, but no big deal. We took a while to order but after placing our order we waited at least 45 mins for our food. It may have been longer, but at least 45. During that time we had to ask for bread after waiting around for at least 10 minutes. Then we had to separately ask for plates, table settings, and napkins.  We received no drink refills until over half way through the meal when a girl carrying a water pitcher gave me a refill. My date asked a host to see a manager and explained our wait time and experience and asked about our food. The food came out a few mins later. We rarely saw our server throughout the meal and he checked in on us zero times since taking our order. He finally showed up to collect our dishes after they had been sitting a good 10 mins. Not only did he not check in on us, we rarely saw him on the floor and had to ask other workers for the settings, bread, etc. I've been to this and other cheesecakes, but this is easily the worst service and experience ive had. Oh, the pasta dish we ordered wasn't fresh out the kitchen hot and my miso salmon had semi burned sauce in one half of the bottom of the fish. See my attached picture. I'm not sure what happened. Today was a combo of incompetent, unaware, inexperienced service, semi absurd wait time, and less than great food quality. The table in front of us and behind us seemed like they received things in a more timely manner, but we weren't keeping track of times on them. I will probably not opt to go to this location in the future, but maybe we just got a bad server.  Forgot his name, but I think it was Mike or Mark. He wasn't overtly rude or anything, he just wasn't present or really doing his job. It's been 15 mins and we are still waiting for our cheesecake, but I'll submit this review before it comes, if it ever comes...."
Gee M.,"San Francisco, CA",65,6,4,5.0,11/25/2017,"Food was pretty good but the stars are for service. I brought my family here for my mom's birthday and our server was excellent. We had a teenager, one restless child under 10 and a birthday girl who didn't want to be celebrated--but by the end of our meal everyone was satisfied. I want to thank our server Lawrence who made sure we got everything we needed from a virgin margarita for our teen to a awesome birthday song for my mom.  Lawrence is the best!!!!"
Chelli I.,"Stockton, CA",62,45,53,4.0,10/25/2017,"This is an update from last visit.  I decided to come back and give it another chance as corporate was very nice and professional with the situation we had last time we visited this location.  Well this time around was so much better, a little longer wait but the service was great. Our server Bobby (I le I remember correctly) was great and took very good care of us. The food was delicious and we got our drinks refilled when needed."
Dani P.,"Oakland, CA",9,39,1,3.0,1/7/2018,"Food as always, was good.  Restrooms clean and stocked.  The lines are horrendous though!!!  The wait is too long, I'll avoid going here Sat nights.  Even the line to order a slice of cheesecake to go was almost out the door and moving so slowly.  Ugh."
Irene S.,"Hayward, CA",42,171,539,2.0,12/10/2017,"I had a nightmare of an experience at Cheesecake Factory that really ruined not only their reputation for me but also what was supposed to be a great celebration of a 49th anniversary. We came here Saturday night at around 5pm and were told up front that they could not accommodate a reservation of more than 7 people because it was not allowed. 7 was the max that they could seat at once. WTH? I have never heard that especially seeing as how we have seated 12 here a while back. They told us that they would have to accommodate 7 on one table and the other 3 on the other table and they would try to have them nearby. So in other words, we had to split our family into 2 tables. We went for it anyways since we had already traveled to this place to celebrate. We were told our wait would be 45 mins to an hour. Pretty standard for this place but we have never really waited the full wait time. Well that wasn't our luck this time. We waited an hour and 15 mins for the table of 3 (not both our tables). Are you kidding me? The other table for 7 we waited 1 hours and 45 minutes for. In fact, we had to let the manager know to check the time on our beeper to which he said ""you guys have been waiting for 1 hour and 39 mins"" before he got the staff to work on a table for us. When our table was finally ready not only was it WAY on the other side of the first table for 3 but we passed by a group of 12 people that were seated right in front of us. So I guess they lied as to the reservation size to us since they clearly allowed other big parties in there. Even our waitress told us that she had never heard of that rule. We decided to take matters into our own hands and make room for the other 3 in our booth and were crammed in there so we can all celebrate together. At the end of it all food of course took a while to arrive and we ended up spending about 4 hours in this restaurant. Oh and need I forget to mention, they didn't even bring us any complimentary dessert to celebrate the anniversary we were celebrating. We all swore to never come here again due to the lying and lack of care the hosts and other staff showed. I would suggest if you are more than 4 people or even 2 people not to come here unless you aren't that hungry."
Peter I.,"Dublin, CA",0,8,,1.0,1/6/2018,"Ordered through Door Dash. When Cheesecake Factory got the order wrong (as DD has proven), only a single item was cooked and was left sitting out. When our Dasher got everything fixed, they refused to remake the one item (that was out dangerously long, I might add). Not only were they assholes about it, they threatened to report her to door dash. Tl;dr: The staff at Cheesecake Factory would rather someone loses their job than to remake food that might make me sick due to their own error. They are lazy and unprofessional. I will never again be giving this location my business, and I highly suggest everyone else avoids it as well."
Courtney S.,"Castro Valley, CA",127,74,100,4.0,4/23/2017,"Sunday April 23rd we walked into The Cheesecake Factory around 12:15 - 12:30, it was packed as usual. The wait was 15 minutes for 2 people, I asked to sit outside and we surprisingly got sat right away.  Our waiters name Christian he was great extremely attentive and patient w/ me, considering they have like 250 items to chose from. For our appetizer we started w/ The mini fried chicken sliders. It comes w/ 4 sliders about 3inches big. Cooked well good fried batter all it could use is a little sauce to elevate the taste. Over all a 4 out of 5 stars. For lunch My boyfriend ordered the Bacon Bacon Cheeseburger. It's came with smoked apple wood bacon, pork belly, American cheese & cheddar cheese , and a garlic butter sauce on a toasted bun. 4.5 out of 5 stars.  I had the BBQ Chicken Salad. IT WAS HUGE. It came w/ Grilled Chicken, cucumbers, black beans, avocados, tomatoes and fried red onions on top w/ a side of BBQ Ranch dressing. I enjoyed it but next time I'll just order a half size. 4.5 out of 5 stars.  I'm not sure if there under new management but a few years ago I didn't really enjoy this location, recently the past few times I've came here have been great and food has been made well. Thanks Stoneridge cheesecake, we'll be back soon and thanks Christian for the great service."
Brett E.,"Discovery Bay, CA",251,332,45,5.0,11/8/2017,I eat out almost every meal for the last 30 years and today I received The best service anyone received on believable how friendly Gina was the last time I was here I was upset at a manager named Matt and left a one star review Gina and for me he doesn't work here anymore so it was time to change it to five stars and take care of Gina you're so lucky cheesecake factory to have her working. That was for as my meal I'll probably leave three stars for my omelette because it was dry and had very little cheese one cheese was one of my four items I ordered I almost sent it back but didn't have the time my friends fish tacos were amazing the calamari was a little too salty and overcoat
S H.,"San Leandro, CA",88,377,431,2.0,11/28/2017,"Not sure whats was going on here that night.. but we has strange interactions with waiters and manager.  everything we wanted to order was out.. never was sure who our wait person was. Manager came out to tell us that dish we order was out because the chef forgot how to make the sauce, then 3 minutes later came out with dish, but it was cold.  Must of been fatigue from the holidays, because we have had much better service.  However looking at the other reviews, this store might have some overall issues."
M M.,"Carmel, CA",0,19,7,1.0,11/8/2017,"This review is about the service, not the food. As we were standing at the cheesecake counter to get a slice to go, the young man behind the counter decided it was more important to wait on a member of their wait staff who'd crowded in line so she could cash out her tips and end her shift. There were two customers besides us waiting to be helped. This rudeness might be expected at Denny's or a truck stop diner, but certainly was not appreciated at a place such as this. To make matters worst, the manager seemed disingenuous in his interest in my complaint regarding his employees.  In short, I expected better -- much better -- service for the prices paid."
Denise M.,"Longwood - Winton Grove, Hayward, CA",133,83,202,4.0,12/29/2017,"There is always a line at the Cheesecake Factory since It is right outside Stoneridge Mall. The best thing to do is to put your name down and while waiting for a spot, go shop around at the mall. The food here is delicious and there are many options since they are a chain restaurant. My favorite thing is the complimentary wheat bread before your meal. I highly recommend the avocado appetizer, their dipping sauce is tangy and sweet. For your entree, you can't go wrong with anything...portions are huge and you can do family style for the best option. And lastly, my favorite cheesecake is the Oreo cheesecake and they plate it SO nicely. Such a nice place if you don't want to cook and want food right after a shopping trip!"
Saeed R.,"Richmond, CA",67,94,39,5.0,9/3/2017,"My go to Cheesecake Factory location. Parking can be a gamble. If you get there early enough, you will have a pretty good parking space. You get there later and you'll be walking the distance. I have been coming to this location for years. Nothing better than shopping and then feasting (or reverse). My order always varies. Sometimes it is the chicken and biscuits, and other times it is the sweet and sour chicken. But no matter what it is, it is always amazing!"
Sun L.,"Cupertino, CA",10,263,16,3.0,11/14/2017,"It is really fusion food, but the location, venue, ambient are all good. So, even price is a little higher, just do it."
Ellen C.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",1,3,2,1.0,12/31/2017,"Worst. Service. Ever.  I still think we were being PUNK'D but it just got so late that Ashton left before the surprise. We waited 1 hour to be seated which we were fine with as this is to be expected on a Saturday during the holidays. Once we were seated, we waited 10 minutes for the waitress to come by and ask if we wanted drinks.  We ordered 2 drinks, 1 burger, 1 sandwich and an appetizer all at once while we had the chance. After another 20 minutes, the waitress came by to let us know they were out of the appetizers we had asked for. Bummer, but whatever. We asked for our drinks again which she came back with shortly after. The Mojito was good but the soda was regular instead of diet. Whatever, it happens.  Waited another 40(!) minutes when the waitress came by and said the fries were still frying and would be another 10 minutes so she could bring out just the burgers.  We said we would wait the 10 minutes for everything. At this point, both parties on either side of us (who were seated after us) were already paying. They caught on and were completely shocked. One family told us they were not leaving until we got our food to see just how long this would go. 15 more minutes passed when a man from management came to tell us they put the wrong sauce on the sandwich and would need another 10 minutes. We couldn't help but laugh. After almost 2 hours from being seated, we finally got our food from a woman who introduced herself as our new waitress! It was so late, the first one had to go home at some point I guess.  The food was great. The Buffalo Chicken Sandwich did have a random black bean in it. We were not offered any discount, free dessert or sincere apology after all this. Luckily(and unluckily), we had a gift card which is the only reason we came back to this restaurant after a previous bad experience.  Needless to say, we have learned our lesson and will definitely not be returning."
Lindsay C.,"San Francisco, CA",218,176,177,1.0,7/31/2017,"Managed to get a seat at one of the tables in the bar and avoid the hour wait at 3:40pm ... that was the only positive thing that happened this entire dining experience.  We were greeted by our server Mike who took our drink order, food order, and brought us our drinks. He completely ignored us the entire time after that.  We had to ask multiple other wait staff if we could get bread and utensils. It was hard to catch our servers attention the few times we saw him pass by because he was always looking straight ahead after checking with in with the table behind us. He never stopped by to say anything to use or tell us our food was on the way or anything.  After about a 45 min wait I asked one of the kind wait staff to get me a manager. I explained to him the situation and told him we have been waiting a long time and our server was nowhere to be seen.  The manager then disappears and a few minutes later our food shows up... served by another server of course! Looking a bit glossed over - that look when its been sitting under the heat lamp for a little while and has been ignored just like us.  Ugh! My super pet peeve when eating out is getting food that's lukewarm. The same manager pops back up and asks how everything is. I explained to him I haven't had a chance to try it but it looks like it's been sitting out. He kind of shrugs his shoulders and disappears never to return. Doesn't offer a do-over, apologies or anything - I knew I should have asked to have our dishes cancelled and had left earlier.  Well the food was subpar - got the Bistro shrimp pasta which was - not hot and not too flavorful. I would have liked some parmesan cheese but that's too much to ask for in this restaurant. I craned my neck towards the back of the restaurant and saw 4 servers standing around talking and laughing. I was trying to catch the attention of anyone and the one server that did catch my gaze quickly turned and walked into the back. The servers here obviously don't work as a team here and that's sad because being a former server that attitude and work mentality kind of just rubs off on everyone.  My date's miso salmon had this burnt sauce taste on the bottom of the fish. At this point I just felt defeated. I rarely come to this place and it used to be such a nice treat when I do come here. This left a sour or should I say burnt sauce flavor in my mouth. I had planned to order two cheesecakes and to save myself from disappointment I just ordered the one.  After finishing most of the food and sitting around our waiter Mike finally shows up again to ask how it was. We ordered our cheesecake and 15 mins later it comes to the table.  And lastly, OMG the restroom was DISGUSTING. The first 2 stalls I walked into the were a mess. The toilet paper was off the roll holder in 2 stalls and on the floor and had stuff on roll in in both stalls. The last stall I walked into was nasty too. I told another one of the manager when I walked out of the restroom and he mentioned he would have someone go look at it. NASTY!  90 mins later I was able to finally get out of this place. I warned the next patron who wanted our table that the server is a bit slow so to be specific about everything you are asking for. She like was just glad to avoid the wait for this place. Good luck lady. What a waste of time and money! I won't be coming back to this establishment after this incident."
Suavecita C.,"Hayward, CA",21,30,69,5.0,9/24/2017,"Our waiter was ""Arturo, or Armando"" I'm not sure and I apologize for forgetting. The food was GREAT!  Service staff phenomenal a great change!  Last time I came it was super dirty behind the takeout counter, but always great service staff.  My drink was strong so cheers to the bartender boo! We had fun we were laughing and I even had our waiter laughing too, I was tipsy....one more cheer for the bartender bae My meatloaf and mashed potatoes with veg was so good.  We had the firecracker salmon rolls which were beautiful as just well as they are  flavorful.  My baby girl enjoyed her kid's menu spaghetti and giant meatball.  I was full so we took tiramisu to go from the bakery and it was yummy, Thanks Cheesecake Factory for a good time and great memories."
Kim K.,"San Dimas, CA",190,40,71,2.0,8/16/2017,"The quality of the food is better at other locations.  The fries that came with my Chicken Club tasted grossly old, closely resembling cardboard. The chicken was extremely tough to chew and not very flavorful. I'm giving one star back because of the cheesecake, as it is as delicious here as other locations.  All in all, not worth the drive. You're better off finding a different location!"
Julieann P.,"Tracy, CA",0,5,4,2.0,12/30/2017,"Came here to eat for the afternoon around 330pm. Wait was less than 30 minutes so that was fine. But, it took almost 50 minutes for the food to come out and when it came out my pasta noodle wasn't cooked all the way so I was kind of disappointed. I also ordered a Bloody Mary, it was good. Probably won't return anytime soon."
David S.,"Union City, CA",22,347,427,3.0,3/26/2017,"This is a very busy place on a Sunday afternoon!  I approached the desk to put in our name for a party of 6 and she tells me it will be at least an hour's wait.  It was a little longer than an hour, but that's ok - we were prepared to wait.   Our waiter was very good.  He refilled drinks and the bread basket right away when empty and took good care of us.  I had the Shepherd's Pie, it was good but nothing to write home about.  Our plates took awhile to come out, but a manager was nice enough to come over to explain that it would be just a few more minutes."
Danielle P.,"Fremont, CA",187,180,270,3.0,7/27/2017,"The lack of stars comes from the poor service. We stopped in Sunday around pm and the wait was estimated to be 50-60 minutes so we opted to sit outside to be seated immediately (it was HOT)  we were given a shaded table which was fine. The server took almost 10 minutes to come by to take our drink order and another 10 minutes to bring us a kids menu. On to the food: Blood orange Mojito: really sweet and weak. Skinny Long Island: not sure what made it ""skinny"" but it tasted like artificial sweetener and had barely and ice- i didn't enjoy it :( Little side salad: Mixed greens with vinaigrette- fresh and satisfying. Kale salad: really fresh and was enjoyed  Kids Pasta with Marinara- Huge portion (enough for an adult and a half) My son enjoyed it. Jamaican jerk shrimp- this is my favorite item on the menu and it was good as always- highly recommend.  The server asked the order in which we wanted the food but it didn't matter as all of it came out at the same time. At one point we asked for salt and pepper and the server, after 10 mins, still had not returned. I grabbed some off of another table & when he finally came by he apologized for all the delays and said "" sorry i had to take care of some issues in the kitchen"". Understandable but not really our problem. Overall the food is good but service is always a challenge. They seem understaffed or the servers have to many tables to manage."
Maximus Decimus Meridius ..,"Modesto, CA",0,32,20,5.0,9/4/2017,"Real good food despite the long waiting time (holiday) Real good portions and great taste. Just a bit on the pricey side. And cheesecakes are the best thus the name of restaurant !! But honestly NO room for both, food and dessert maybe 99% of people would take dessert home... Which is good :)"
Nancy M.,"Diablo, CA",0,36,,1.0,12/29/2017,"I was here early today(11:30) with friends.  I had the Chicken Picata which I often get for lunch.  Today it was COLD, pasta looked like it had been sitting and there were 2 small pieces of chicken???  We NEVER saw the waiter after placing the order.  We asked for him, he did not return. Terrible"
Olivia C.,"Alameda, CA",308,338,1863,3.0,12/19/2016,The Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite occasional restaurants. This location tends to always be busy regardless of the time because of its location in Stoneridge Mall.  I went with my visiting friend today and we waited around 40 minutes for a table for two. They seemed a bit short staffed but our server did the best she could. The bread plates on table were both dirty (crusted cheese on mine) and some unknown brown thing on hers. Our server immediately replaced them with new plates when she brought our bread and drink order.  The saving grace for today was my miso salmon and the pink lemonade. I substituted the rice with their fluffy mashed potatoes.  The glaze was a little burnt but I still loved it. The salmon was juicy and the mashed potatoes were soft and well seasoned. The pink lemonade had a sugar rim and wasn't too watery or too tart.
Melissa G.,"Salida, CA",9,46,4,1.0,11/3/2017,"Terrible service!!!!  We came here today at noon for lunch, got seated right away but had the rudest server ever! Sierra or Cierra however she spelt it definitely didn't want to be there today. She had a attitude when she took our order and rushed us, I asked her if there was any other soup besides clam chowder for the lunch special and she looked at me like I was dumb for asking that. Sheesh normally restaurants have more than 1 choice. We also never received straws, we had to ask another server for straws & he looked as happy as Sierra did (lordt).... she also wasn't anywhere to be found when we needed refills, & when she finally came around we were almost done eating. I felt like telling her she should of called out today .  I like the food here but the service is a hit or miss, I've had more than one experience with rude servers or ones that sucked at being a waitress / waiter  Management should do something... but they don't lol The only plus size is the food, it's good!! I've tried several things and there all delicious.  You also can never go wrong with the cheesecake. My favorite is the mango key lime!"
Ramona G.,"San Diego, CA",3294,1439,1446,5.0,12/12/2016,"I am shocked times 10 that I haven't reviewed this Cheesecake Factory location! From all restaurants in the Bay Area this is the place that I've probably visited the most! I grew up in San Ramon and the only places I would go to meet up with friends was either Cheesecake Factory or P.F. Chang's.  For one of my birthdays years ago I made all my friends eat dinner on their own beforehand and when we came here I made them each order a different flavor of cheesecake! I've tried them all and hands down the best flavor is Dulce de Leche!!! I would have never thought it would be the best one but all my friends and I voted and this flavor won by a landslide!  I hadn't been to this Cheesecake Factory in years and I had the chance to come back here for lunch on Saturday. I love their brown bread that they serve! Their fried mac & cheese balls are my favorite thing to order here!  Service is always on top! There's usually a long line to get seated here but it's so convenient that it's located at the mall so you can shop while you kill time.  Definitely a great Cheesecake Factory location but my #1 CF choice is the one in Walnut Creek, that one is huge and looks gorgeous too!!!"
Celia Z.,"Livermore, CA",142,161,239,4.0,2/11/2017,"Strictly written about the happy hour. Cheesecake factory has one of my favorite happy hours. Their food choices are abundant and the drinks are little watered down but cheap. I went with a couple coworkers on a Thursday and it wasn't super busy. The tables were constantly filled as there are only a few tables in the bar area for happy hour but no one was waiting around. Between the 3 of us we ordered quite a few items. We had the buffalo blast, nachos, avo eggrolls (a must!), and the crab wontons. Everything was delicious and the portions were huge. We ended up with quite a bit of leftovers.  The cheesecake factory is located in the stoneridge mall. So there is plenty of parking from what I could see. I will definitely be back !"
Nay C.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,20,,5.0,12/23/2017,"Food was great, served up hot and delicious as always. Service was good too. The best was the Mango Mojito. Not every bartender knows how to mix a Mojito. But this Mojito was perfect!! I'm giving the 5 stars to the bartender who was working on December 21 around 7pm."
Rhiannon D.,"Oakland, CA",75,371,78,4.0,7/23/2017,"This place is always busyyyyyy. I really love the Cheesecake Factory tho. So many damn options and they cater to just about every type of eater. And that damn free bread. We sat in the bar area and our waitress was SO DAMN SLOW!! I forgot her name but, man, the girl has no sense of urgency. I work in the industry and I rarely tip less than 20% so she got lucky. No wonder the turnover for tables took forever, slow servers."
Anil J.,"Fremont, CA",6,40,169,3.0,10/29/2017,Wait time is 55 min on any day. Plan your presence based on your hungry level and patience. Environment is quite calm and cool. I am vegetarian and tried ordering veggie burger or egg plant parmesan. However both are out of stock and after a long debate she come with some new says veggie burger she may able to get it...
Emily C.,"San Lorenzo, CA",13,5,4,1.0,9/18/2017,"Fantastic setting for a casual dinner with family and friends. However, the wait is sooooo not worth it. My family and I, a group of 6 people were told our wait was 40-50 minutes before being seated. However, we were not seated until 75 minutes since we've arrived.  The food was another 40-45 minutes wait!! This ridiculous!!?!?? If you guys are short staffed please hire more people as needed. I understand this was a weekend night. However, this is outrageous.  Service was ok. Not outstanding. By the time my Farfalle with chicken and mushroom order was served to me, Some of the bow tie noodle had already harden and dried.  The server charged us for an extra beverage as well, but we found out after paying our bill.  In addition, I work for door dash, a food delivery service. This place took an hour or more to prepare an order of streak?!? The order was about $30. I wasted 2 hours on one order. I will NEVER take a Cheesecake Factory order until their service speed improves."
