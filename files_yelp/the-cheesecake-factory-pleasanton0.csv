Krysten E.,"Tracy, CA",36,6,4,1.0,7/8/2017,Came in around 9 and the restaurant was packed and there was a bit of a wait. I work at a restaurant  so I understand things are a little slower when you're packed. The wait wasn't too bad. When we got seated we had to wait 30 mins for anyone to greet us or ask for drinks and the food took about an hour. By the time I saw our waiter I asked if we could just make our food to go. I got the shrimp alfredo and it was very overcooked with hardly any sauce on it. They need more employees to accommodate the size of the restaurant or train their employees more on efficiency.
Michelle G.,"Pleasanton, CA",18,18,1,2.0,5/16/2017,"The food is good, but went on a Monday night, ordered 2 appetizers and it took literally 60 mins from sitting down before our food came out, and that was after waiting 30 mins at 8pm.  I took a girlfriend out for her birthday.  Disappointing.  Couldn't find our waitress for drink refills or to pay the bill."
Kyle D.,"San Mateo, CA",192,191,272,4.0,2/10/2016,"I've been here on multiple occasions and from what I've tried, this is one of the better Cheesecake Factories around. Service is always super friendly and approachable, and the place is super clean. Only downside would probably be slow-ish service when they're busy, but you can't really help that.  The kale and quinoa salad here is a must! The kale is sooooo crunchy and perfect and the quinoa doesn't taste bland or lost at all. I recommend adding some avocado on the side, it's uh-may-zing."
Kathy M.,"San Jose, CA",228,24,67,3.0,4/25/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory here in Stoneridge is like any other Cheesecake Factories out there. The wait can be long from 30-40 minutes since this is such a popular chain restaurants and lots of families like to come here for dinner.  My family and I ordered the calamari as an appetizer. It's one of our favorite items on their appetizer list. It's crispy, salty, and flavorful. However, I will admit that this is not one of the best calamari you can get. For my entree, I ordered the garlic noodles with shrimp. I thought it tasted a little plain, dry and didn't really taste the garlic like I thought I would. Nonetheless, I still enjoyed my meal with beer and the complimentary bread. Their brown bread is the best! I always like to ask the server for another fresh batch of brown bread to go.  For dessert, I always order their red velvet cheesecake. It's my favorite flavor that they have and every bite is a little taste of heaven with a dash of whipped cream. Their cheesecake slices are pretty generous and the prices for them are fair. The cheesecakes are the best part of the restaurant.  Although it wouldn't really be on the top of my list of restaurants, the Cheesecake Factory would be a decent place for a family lunch/dinner."
Audrey M.,"San Jose, CA",69,42,18,1.0,5/12/2017,Horrible! The worst experience ever! It took an hour for our appetizers to come. Once we ordered it took an hour for our food to come. My food was cold. It took them another hour to make my food again. We were there for over 3 hours. The manager comped me a cheesecake. I'll be writing a letter to corporate next.
Crystal B.,"Patterson, CA",126,68,23,1.0,8/7/2017,"I had a very awful experience visiting this restaurant and it all focuses on the manager Jennifer.  Jennifer is a manager of this restaurant however does not know the definition of hospitality. Here is the definition: the friendly and generous reception and entertainment of guests, visitors, or strangers.  Here is how my encounter began. I live over an hour away from Cheesecake and had an opportunity to order the new cheesecake celebration based on a errand run to Sunol.  I called around 10:35 am and was told my to go order would be ready in less than 10 mins.  I parked my car in the to-go parking and walked inside.  The restaurant was not busy.  I walked to the podium and was told by the greeter place walk a few feet over and obtain my to go order.  I waited while a few people were busy talking to each other, looking at their hands or making coffee.  I looked back over to the podium and this lady with long red hair in a ponytail and bright blue shirt talked to the greeter, stayed for a few mins and walked away.  I looked back at the people behind the counter to finally gain someone's attention.  A waiter finally looked at me and said someone will be with you soon.  A few more minutes and i decided to look back at the podium, once again a lady with the red long hair and bright blue shirt arrived and talked to the greeter stayed a few mins and went away.  I had finally had enough.  I went to the greeter and asked if I could speak to a manager.  Guess who the manager was, the lady with the long red hair and bright blue shirt.  I told her I had been waiting a while and needed help.  Her response to me was that she assumed someone was helping me.  Really??? I asked for her to give me her name.  She never apologized for the delay in service and did not even offer to comp a discount for the cheesecake.  She did not even say goodbye and have great day.  Jennifer needs to go back to customer service school.  It is her job to ensure proper customer service and she failed.  The recent reviews are pretty poor based on horrible service and I can truly see why."
Julie G.,"Brentwood, CA",0,2,2,1.0,6/12/2017,This was one of the worst experiences I have ever had in a restaurant. (6-12-17)The service and food were horrible.  When my food finally arrived my salad had no salad dressing on it and the sandwich was dry. When I told my waitress that there was no dressing on my salad she insisted there was and that it had soaked into the lettuce.  She did bring me a side of dressing but told me to slowly pour it over my salad because it will soak in like it did previously. I would have had a much better meal at Denny's for a lot less money. I will never return here again.
Victoria U.,"San Leandro, CA",1,10,1,1.0,9/16/2016,"Honestly I'm deathly allergic to tomatoes, I would rather go across the way to CPK and go into anaphylactic shock than wait for my name to be called at this fucking place. I still like your cheesecake though."
Jan G.,"San Leandro, CA",0,24,,2.0,10/3/2017,"Went for a co-workers birthday lunch today.  They have redone their menu since I was there last...big improvement!  We were seated right away and the waiter, Danny, showed up and took our drink order which didn't take too long to arrive.  Then came the bread and butter but we had no knives and missing one place setting and napkin.  Had to ask twice  and finally after 5 or more minutes, he brought knives but got a bit snippy about it.  Seriously? The food was very slow to arrive and he never brought the missing napkin and place setting. When he brought the food, I asked for water.  Never came back so when almost done eating, I stopped a busboy who got me water.  We were there 1.5 hours and had to leave without birthday dessert as we had to get back to work.  Too bad...food was good!  Would go back and hope we get waited on by someone else!"
K M.,"San Leandro, CA",12,51,16,1.0,8/4/2017,"Tonight I spent 2 hours and 10 minutes at Cheesecake Factory due to having to wait for everything (yes I calculated the times.) I waited 30 minutes for a table then I waited 10 minutes for a server to approach our table. He was very friendly but the first thing he said to us was ""sorry for the wait but if I would've taken my appropriate break then you would've been waiting at least another 5 minutes."" I work in the service industry myself and you never tell a customer your personal problems. We then waited another 40 minutes for our entrees. I never once was offered a refill and never was checked in on during the meal. The server came and apologized and all was well. We asked for the leftovers to go and the check. He then put my leftovers into the dirty bowl my boyfriend was eating from so that he had less to carry. Okay fine. Then we waited 20 minutes for him to show up with the check and my leftovers. When we complained to management they offered a free cheesecake. Then we waited another 10 minutes for the cheesecake. Oh to top it off he said our card was declined when in reality the chip just didn't work and the card needed to be swiped. As nice as the server was, I literally wasted over 2 hours of my life."
Robert D.,"San Ramon, CA",30,41,6,4.0,4/21/2017,Been here many times. Foods always good. Just very hard to get a seat and unbelievably busy in the evening. If your not here early avoid dinner time as you have to wait forever.
Beto P.,"Newark, CA",0,45,19,2.0,10/17/2016,Food as always is good but what I don't like it's their service. Took my family to have dinner (party o 8). The hostess told me it would take 45min to an hour. An hour and 40minutes later we were still not seated.  This has been a bad experience and I won't be coming back to this place with large parties.
Ammar H.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,10,,1.0,11/6/2016,I don't know I keep coming back to this location it's the worst in the state hands down. I'm not even going to get into detail about our experience as it was a nightmare again. I'll end this review by saying I walked out with my family and walked over to PF Chang's next door to eat.
Adrianne Joy B.,"Modesto, CA",4,11,1,1.0,2/20/2017,"Horrible. Waited over an hour for a table, and then we waited another hour for our food. When we finally got our meals, my Asian Chicken Salad was as thoroughly soggy as a wet sock. After I sent it back, I brought my husband's attention to the waiting plate area with the heat lamps.. we counted five salads that sat there for over five minutes. I should have taken a picture! How do chefs not know that salads should be made dead last, not waiting (and should not be put under a lamp), while everyone else's food gets prepared?! Truly, this was barr none, the most unappetizing salad I have ever had. But at least I got to watch my whole family eat for another hour. Their complimentary ""sourdough"" bread was hard and terrible. Additionally, because it was my parents' 40th Anniversary, my husband and I paid for a substantial part of the bill. I will never go back."
Alana N.,"Castro Valley, CA",188,1,,1.0,8/1/2017,"If I could give zero stars, I would. The poor service seems to afflict this location specifically. Tonight is the last night I'll ever be here. I called to place an order for pickup and actually made it from my house to the restaurant while I was on hold. I called back after being on hold for 10 minutes and asked to not be put on hold, but the hostess told me she couldn't take orders and put me on hold anyway. When I got there I asked her if she was the one that answered the phone and showed her that I was still on hold with them. She immediately had an attitude and told me there was nothing she could do to help me, waving her hands at me like she was dismissing me. When I asked the girl at the dessert counter who answered the phone to take the orders she said she was. I told her what happened, and SHE copped an attitude with me, saying she wasn't responsible for the long wait, that there was nothing she could do about it, waving her hands around at me like I was a nuisance. I have worked in the service industry since I was a teenager and this was one of the worst experiences I've had. I will not be returning."
Oday A.,"San Francisco, CA",1,7,5,5.0,10/29/2016,Very Busy place. We had to wait for 40 minutes to sit on a table. The service was welcoming and the food is perfect.
Dallas H.,"Dublin, CA",0,8,4,1.0,9/22/2017,"Ordered to go 3 items. One was the chicken Parmesan sandwich. When I received it was cold. In fact the cheese wasn't even semi melted. The heat alone of the chicken should have melted it somewhat, but it didn't. The macaroni ball appetizers was cold too. The cake was ok. My whole point is this  came around $40 and was sub par. I will not be back. I was surprised by the quality knowing the company brand and price."
G. P.,"Livermore, CA",0,13,1,1.0,11/13/2016,"Never again. After waiting 45 minutes for a couple of appetizers and asking where the hell our food was, someone came to the table and apologized for running out of crab cakes. They then made the damn things, delivered them another 20 minutes later.  Two and a half hours for one drink each and two appetizers. I'm done with this damn place!! Stay the hell out of here unless you have a half day to burn on a single meal!!"
Honest R.,"San Ramon, CA",0,69,4,1.0,5/14/2017,Not an isolated instance you still don't answer your phone!!! I called today about a dozen times and no answer. Once someone picked up and then hung up on me!
Lan D.,"San Jose, CA",0,4,,1.0,5/7/2017,"If I could put a zero star, I would. Last time we were here,  they gave our table to someone else after they told us that the wait will be 5 min for a party of ten. We had to wait nearly 2 hours after that. Today, we got here at 5:30pm, they said 30 min, it's been 1 hour 20 min and they now split our group into two. I thought I'd give them another chance but I guess this is the way they work. I will not be coming back to this  Cheesecake Factory again."
