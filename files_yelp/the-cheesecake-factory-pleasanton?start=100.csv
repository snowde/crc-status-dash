Andrea T.,"Fremont, CA",29,50,124,4.0,10/13/2017,Bakery was short staff and I only came in to get 2 cheesecakes slices . Plain no other toppings added it took 30 mins but they where friendly and looked like they where short staff .. who can say no to cheese cake factory !
Sara T.,"Pleasanton, CA",0,1,,1.0,12/18/2017,Lemon Garlic Shrimp pasta to go. Haven't touched it yet. Cost $18 for few shrimps and a pasta that is not even cooked properly. Stuck together as you see in the picture. When I asked why this doesn't match the one on the screen they said no this is it. They took it to the kitchen and instead of fixing it tried to garnish it with more garlic and that even made it worse because of over powered garlic taste. Pleasanton Cheesecake Factory has a very low quality chef and management. When I asked to at least change my food for something else they did not do that. Very disappointed. They made me not wanting to go to any of their branches anymore.
Christina A.,"Hayward, CA",0,22,,4.0,10/16/2017,The crab artichoke dip is a must have every time we eat here best way to start our meal.. the kale salad and salmon are a great choice if you are looking for a healthy option.. the pastas are delicious also..
Wyland L.,"Honolulu, HI",102,61,11,2.0,5/6/2017,Food Good.  Service Bad. Slow. Slow. Slow. Been here 3 hours. Want to go home. Don't want to eat here anymore... Got here at 6:30. Leaving now...9:45..........
Neloffer E.,"Tracy, CA",40,82,123,3.0,4/21/2017,"This place is overrated and crazy packed. Their wait times are usually about an hour to hour/half and no one usually likes to wait that long to have their meal. Their appetizers are actually really good, I usually get the fried macaroni and avocado egg rolls... so delicious! As for the entree, I usually order the Jambalaya and it isn't all that great. I wish they could add more spices and flavor to the pasta and shrimp. It's not my favorite place to dine at, but I'd probably come here once or twice in a year."
Jamie L.,"Dublin, CA",55,14,1,1.0,7/12/2017,"This place is ridiculous! I wish there was an option for ZERO STARS!!! We've had so many issues coming here over the years! This is the last straw. We will never come here again!!! Waited an hour to be seated. Sat down and it took about 15 minutes until someone actually came to the table to take our order. We then ordered all of our food including meals for our 3 boys that were with us. After another 40 minutes my salad and appetizer came along with my husbands calamari but his salad that he ordered was not brought along with it as we requested. The boys were still waiting on their food and were incredibly ansy and starving. 30 min later one of my sons meals came. My other 2 boys still didn't have their meals and everyone is eating separately at this point. We were so pissed! My husband still hadn't gotten his salad at this point. When we were almost done eating I told the waitress that my husband never got his salad. I told her to cancel it because we were almost done and my husband was full on bread. Oh! And the knife I was given had crusty crap all over it. I told the waitress and she looked at me like she didn't care. I was so disgusted by the service, the quality of the food(my sons cheese pizza had no bread at the bottom just melted cheese and the ranch dressing on my salad tasted horrible) and mismanagement by everyone! It was a mess in there. Never will come here again and I will tell my friends not to waste their money!! Over $100 with tip that we paid for crap service and gross food.  We were there on Saturday 7/8/17"
Aubrey T.,"San Francisco, CA",25,19,36,1.0,9/18/2016,"Came in for my mom's birthday and checked in for 12 people and left them my phone #. I anticipated the long wait which was 1-1&1/2 hours, so I was prepared.  It's been 1 hour and 27 minutes got a call saying that our table is almost ready, however there is one party they are waiting for to get out. 1 hour and 40 minutes, one of the manager apologies and says they will comp us a couple appetizers. They finally seat us 15 minutes later. Ordered appetizers, but the manager kept coming back saying they ran out of a couple items. Ordered drinks, took a while to receive, entrees took about 45 minutes or more. My dad complained about the lighting because it was dark, one of the bulbs went off on the ceiling and we kindly asked the manager if we can get candle. When she came back, she slammed the candle in front of my dad and it looked like he lost his appetite after that. I'm not sure what she realized what she did, but we complained and she ""apologized."" Our waitress was nice, we understand it was busy, but she forgot a couple request we made. Like I said, this was for my mom's birthday and I wanted this dinner to be stress free and let everyone have good time. Sad to say, this was the worst experience ever. Come to think of it, this whole experience took 4 hours!! That's half a freakin' work shift."
David L.,"San Lorenzo, CA",165,18,33,4.0,7/4/2017,"I probably would have rated this a three star had it not been for our waiter, Augi. This guy was seriously a next level employee. He was incredibly kind, attentive, funny, and just overall a delightful human. We had a great time getting to know him. Now on to the rest. After ordering, my date and I waited roughly 45 minutes for our food - and when it did arrive, it was only half our order. My burger was complete, however her Steak Dianne came without one of it's main attractions - the mashed potatoes. It was just a huge empty plate with some steak medallions and mushrooms.  We were told that the potatoes were on their way very soon. Weird, but whatever. However 15 minutes passed, and no potatoes. A waiter came by and said the potatoes would be another 15 minutes. So we waited. After 15 minutes, the same waiter came by, and offered her complimentary fries. A nice gesture, but still no potatoes.  Long story short, we were compensated with free cheesecake, which was nice, but there were STILL no potatoes until we asked one last time before leaving.  The food was very good, albeit incomplete, and the staff seemed genuinely sorry for the inconvenience. Which is in the end totally fine by me. However the real award here goes to our waiter Augi. I'm not joking when I say he was one of the friendliest waiters I've ever had. God bless you, Augi. And God bless those mashed potatoes."
Elly S.,"Pleasanton, CA",17,3,,4.0,10/24/2017,"If you are looking for a great atmosphere, look no further because this location serves the best food with great ambiance!  The reason I gave it a four stars is because there is lots of noise inside the restaurant, but I usually sit outside so it's great food with best views!!"
Angela F.,"Riverbank, CA",60,8,1,1.0,3/26/2017,"Hour and half wait only to get the poorest service ever today. Once seated, we had to wait over 15 minutes to get bread and water. After asking for a second basket of bread (because our 3 kids were starving by that point), it took another 15 minutes. We eat at this Cheesecake Factory at least 4 times a year and celebrate our special occasions, and the service just keeps declining. It's a shame. Update: After posting this review, our experience couldn't have gotten any worse. I ordered the combination Steak Diane & Herb Crusted Salmon. There was no crust to my salmon and instead had a very off taste and texture. Almost as if the salmon had sat out for along period of time before it was cooked. My tongue got numb and I asked the sever to please take it away. He responded that he would tell the cooks. My husband ordered the Hibachi Steak medium well, which came out like jerky. Against our better judgement, we ordered the famous cheesecake, only to find a hair on it! We showed the server the hair and expressed our total dissatisfaction of our experience. Manager came over and offered to comp part of the order, but showed little concern for our experience. We have decided not to go back again. Just not worth our time or money. If I could, I would give zero stars!"
Jro B.,"Portland, OR",362,109,371,5.0,7/30/2017,Very good cheesecake factory at a bunch of them all over the country and this was especially since I haven't been here in a long while very prompt service.  just excellent all around I really enjoyed myself I would definitely be back more often
Amanda N.,"Lodi, CA",504,2,1,1.0,7/24/2017,"Can I give zero stars?! I've been a server in many different restaurants for over 4 years so I understand how stressful busy nights can be, that being said, that is no excuse for how terrible our service was.  We arrived around 8 and was quoted 30 min for a wait for 2 of us, which is fine. We waiting almost 40 min, also totally fine.  After we got sat and about 10 min of not being greeted, I stopped a server to ask if he could find ours. He rolled his eyes and walked off, nobody came.  A total of 20 min goes by and I stopped somebody to get me a manager. The manager comes over, apologizes takes our order and I let him know the guest next to us was waiting almost as long so he takes theirs as well.  When bread was brought to our table my boyfriend asked for a dr. Pepper and was brought a Diet Coke 10 min later by someone else.  About 20 after we ordered the table next to us got their food. We waited about another 20 min before we just got up and left. We were sitting at our table for over an hour and never once had a server. I have been to many different Cheesecake factories and never had this horrible of service. I've never once complained to a manager or walked out before my food arrived. Even after I spoke to a manager, nothing got better. Let's just say being 7 months pregnant didn't help how irritated I was. I will definitely never go back to this location."
Noa S.,"Palo Alto, CA",2,5,,1.0,11/30/2017,I ordered a sandwich and fries from here and I can say it was the worst thing I've ever had. The fries were soft and cold. The sandwich was also cold. I am a HUGE fan of the Cheesecake Factory but I can't say I see myself going again considering the service was just as bad as the food.
Monica G.,"San Leandro, CA",190,36,2,1.0,11/18/2017,"A friend and I came here last night, about an hour before closing. We got sat right away, and the friendliest waiter I have ever met came right away. He took our drink orders, said the bread would be done baking in 5 minutes. Cool. He took our appetizer order (crab and artichoke dip) and it came out within 5 minutes. It was lukewarm, not seasoned, and way overloaded with mayonnaise. My friend and I were disgusted, but whatever. Things happen, talked to the manager and he took it back. Our entrees came, she ordered the buffalo blazer things, and I had shrimp scampi. Both AWFUL! Her chicken was so undercooked the batter was still raw and runny. The batter on my shrimp was still raw and wet, and super soggy, and no, not just the side sitting in the sauce, THE WHOLE THING, all 6 of them! There was no flavor, and the pasta was lukewarm at best. The manager came back and we told him about the food....SHOWED HIM THE FOOD! And he didn't even apologize! Instead he patronized us, and told us our complaints didn't make any sense. As a food service manager, I was insulted. As someone who has sous Chef experience, I was insulted. AS A CONSUMER WHO DROVE 40 minutes to SPEND MY MONEY AT THIS ESTABLISHMENT I WAS INSULTED!! Sergio showed no empathy, and was totally aloof. Sammy apologized, and talked to my friend and I like he actually had a heart. Thank you to the waiter Benjamin and whoever was behind the bar. At least we enjoyed our drinks. I'm done with the Cheesecake Factory....you were better 10 years ago."
Lisa S.,"Salinas, CA",2,96,38,3.0,7/3/2017,"Bathrooms were in horrible shape. Women's bathroom trash was full, water all over the floor. Men's bathroom sink had vomit in it. The wait for lunch was apx. 20 minutes. The food was good,  I had a beet salad. Our waitresses, although friendly was so busy, our drinks never got refilled and we had to ask someone else for the check. The hype is not worth the wait. Try CPK, less wait, great food."
Daisy A.,"Santa Ana, CA",0,32,7,4.0,7/3/2017,Came in on Sunday night 7.2.17 and was recommended to sit at the bar since service would be better than table late at night. I am glad my coworkers and I sat at the bar. We met Chris svrck who was great. I ordered a jambalaya pasta with no shrimp due to shrimp allergy and when I got my pasta it was dry without any sauce. Chris immediately asked that sauce be brought to me and notice it was taking a while so he personally went to go grab it.  Going beyond is great customer service!  Fried mac and cheese balls are highly recommended.
Monica S.,"Concord, CA",0,31,12,5.0,9/27/2017,"I want to give 4 stars cause the food is overpriced and I'm not a huge fan of the menu. However, I am a Customer Service Advocate, and today's service was excellent. Our waiter Shirvin (could be wrong) was perfect and over delivered on his service and professionalism. He was kind, friendly, personable and made our Birthday Celebration  great. Our med size group had no idea he was covering an entire section on his own, until a manager made note of it and asked how we were doing. The manager even made a brief appearance during our requested Birthday Moment. Kudos to him too. Shirvin (I really hope that's his name) is the reason I would return to this location, not the Cheese Cake. For me, Customer Service is everything!!"
Virgil B.,"Central Sacramento, Sacramento, CA",104,4,,1.0,8/21/2017,"Today is my birthday solar eclipse epic day family, friends and I were waiting for an hour to get seated we saw other groups getting seated before us. Wtf P.F. Chang's here we come"
Stacy D.,"San Lorenzo, CA",95,5,2,1.0,8/18/2017,"I've recently been disappointed with The Cheesecake Factory. Last Saturday I decided to give it another try. I ordered Evelyn's pasta for pick up. I asked for the dish not to have pine nuts as I've recently had oral surgery and can't have nuts. I picked my order up, didn't check the food as the receipt on the bag said no pine nuts. When I got home, I opened the container to find a ton of pine nuts. I called and spoke to a manager (I believe his name was Jason) who apologized and offered to credit my card and send me a gift card. Sounds nice and all but.... now it's a week later and not only did I not get credited back but I never received a gift card. I basically paid for food I couldn't eat. You'd think they'd be cautious when it comes to requests to remove nuts considering that so many people have nut allergies ,sigh...."
Megan L.,"La Jolla, San Diego, CA",356,235,165,4.0,2/6/2017,"Service is where this location just shines.  My servers name was John, he was working so hard on a Sunday night but he still made sure that our orders were taken and we had a crazy amount of bread. Because he took a little longer than expected to get us water or take our order, he offered us two free cheesecakes at the end of the night along with a whole entire wheat bread stick. Taller than me almost! Not gonna talk about the food cause it's a chain... the food is food I suppose.  Anyway, John, if you're reading this or if your manager is reading this. You deserve a raise for being the best server of 2017! You went above and beyond last night to make sure we left happy :)"
