Stacey G.,"Roseville, CA",2,95,36,4.0,10/6/2011,"I am finding I am enjoying this place more than in years past. Granted, the menu is still huge & overwhelming but they are offering more 'healthy' choices.  For the 2nd time, I started with the Charred Shishito Peppers. So tasty! Tried them 1st with my brother, & again the other night. Now to decide on a meal: how in the WORLD can you decide with 16 pages?? Fish or pork? Asked the waitress & after she told me the applesauce is homemade- that was it. The porkchop was cooked really nicely. Still juicy, thick with a nice glaze. The mashed potatoes were great! Loved the spinach & ordered an extra side of apple sauce. I was only able to eat 1/2. Brought the other 1/2 home for a perfect size dinner tonight. Had to do dessert but took that home too. After reading over 2 pages of desserts: chose the White Chocolate Caramel Macadamia Nut Cheesecake. O.M.G. I am not a 'cheesecake person'. Last night the cheesecake & the whipped cream was calling me. I had 2 bites. Simply because the 1st bite led me to #2. Why did I stop? It was 10:30 & I was full!! Had it for dessert tonight.  It's a nice feeling to know I am looking forward to going back. :) See you there!"
Nancy F.,"Mountain House, CA",27,219,257,4.0,12/28/2008,"Where do i begin...If you can make it for the early happy hour (M-F 4pm-6pm) you can get all kinds of stuff at a great price. For example you can get a chopped salad (like a cobb, my favorite) for $4 and alot of appetizers for about $4 each it is great to try them all out to see what you will like. The mini cuban sandwiches, avocado eggrolls, macaroni balls, potstickers the list goes on.  The salads are soooo good and they are huge you can split them with someone we have had the BBQ chicken ranch and the chopped cobb and we get these everytime. I have also tried some pasta dishes like the four cheese and suprisingly the guacamole is really good and it is huge. The drinks are a little pricey for the little glass you get unless you get the ultimate margarita but it is still $13 and that is not including patron silver."
Wesley H.,"Mountain View, CA",0,12,,2.0,2/18/2013,"We recently held a family reunion at the Cheesecake Factory.  There were 20 of us. The maitre'd was rude. He kept threatening that he would not hold our table if we weren't all there. They don't take reservations and that is a problem when you have a large party with people coming in from out of town. The service in notoriously slow.  It took over an hour before they even took our orders. The food is OK.  The cheesecake is good. Overall, I will not go back again."
Li C.,"Brisbane, Australia",6,128,11,1.0,5/24/2014,"1 star the food was decent and the half assed service was ok. I like Cheesecake factory but this one blows. Sat down served a little too fast didn't get a minute to check the drink menu. Our server was nice but she seriously needs a GPS as she disappeared A LOT. She managed to get our drinks to us and get the bill/tip that was about it. She served our appetizer and quickly disappeared. I guess she expected us to lap it up off the table as we were not given small plates other than the bread plates already on the table, after trying to locate a server, we just stole tiny plates from an empty table, thanks. Someone else brought our main dish. Another server finally came over and served us dessert which we couldn't finish, where he failed when we asked to get our desserts to go, upon getting home and opening the boxes later that night the desserts had just been dumped in and looked like cheesecake and tiramisu mush. This would have been a great review if the staff were taught cs is not just a smile and being friendly, it's about following through and completing the customer process from start to finish, would also be great if staff were taught how presentation is key. I'm pretty sure when the Overton family started this venture they never thought their beautiful desserts would be served as a box of mush for someone to take home."
Jessica B.,"Danville, CA",98,27,4,4.0,1/10/2014,This place is always busy no matter what time I go in. Had a great lunch 2 days ago. Nice glass of wine and the artichoke app is delicious with the garlic mayo. Our server was friendly and always checking on us. Honestly I never need a full meal because their portions are so big! Next time I will have to treat myself to cheesecake!!
Brian V.,"Livermore, CA",0,3,,1.0,2/12/2014,"Went in for a simple piece of cheesecake to go. No line, not a busy time. 4 girls behind the to go area for cheesecake and it took 15 minutes to do their job. 1 girl on the phone and the others talking and laughing about something and nobody actually doing their job. Should have called the manager."
Cammi S.,"Livermore, CA",142,101,7,5.0,1/3/2011,"Not a fan of the wait, but it's standard for every Cheesecake Factory you go to. I've waited much longer for a table at an Outback Steakhouse.  I recommend: Appetizers: Avocado Eggrolls  Fried Calamari Fried Zucchini Thai Chicken Wraps (peanut allergy warning!) Chicken Pot Stickers Buffalo Blasts Entree: Beef Ribs Double Crunch Cheeseburger Spicy Chipotle Chicken Pasta Cajun Jambalaya Pasta Gumbo (BEST EVER) Ribeye Herb Crusted Filet of Salmon Miso Salmon Desserts: White Chocolate Macadamia Nut Cheesecake Tiramisu Cheesecake Linda's Fudge Cake Dulce De Leche Cheesecake Reese's Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake Cheesecake FYI: The adult marinara sauce for the pasta is a little spicy!! Kids don't usually like it, but the Kid sized pasta marinara has no spice."
Sarah D.,"Dublin, CA",0,6,,3.0,1/1/2012,"I've  been to Cheesecake Factory  many time, and I found it to be a pretty good experience until my last visit 12/27/11. There are a large variety of different types of foods and the staff was really nice. We came to this location for my husband's birthday dinner and was told the wait was 15-20 mind and we end up waiting 1 hour and 15 minutes. It was not fair for them to lie and keep us waiting. They are in the mall so we could have gone in the mall instead of waiting idle in the cold weather outside. And the worst part was the management who was fully aware of our situation.  Some of the things that I really like about Cheesecake Factory the great food , fair portion of food ,and wonderful deserts. Not good for groups if you have a party of up to four then yea you can get table in reasonable amount of time.   I will give 3 start for the great food and service but the wait tables sucks."
Sam P.,"San Jose, CA",5,20,2,5.0,12/24/2011,"We love the Place Never fells always Great Food. Had a Very Nice Waitress (Maria M.), She took very good care of us. Had the Steak Diane , Sooooooooo Good.... But like always ,we can never finish all of our food Be back Soon......."
linda l.,"Dublin, CA",9,31,7,1.0,8/24/2012,"I have been taking my husband here every year for his birthday and we normally get great service; however, today time was not the case. I called in advance so they would know it was his birthday and I  received a reservation at 530 pm today. The waitress we were given did not know in advance that it was my husbands birthday. Moreover, she did not bring him a small desert or sing him happy birthday. She just gave us our check with his birthday wishes. So I went to the restroom and asked another server if they could bring us a birthday wish. He told me he would bring it over and I waited 10 minutes and nothing came. So frustrated I just left with my husband and asked to speak with the manager. I told him what happened and he only said sorry. Very disappointed and we will not be coming back."
Jaeun H.,"Pleasanton, CA",0,2,3,3.0,10/8/2013,This place gives otherplace a run for its money.  The all salad is incredible and unlike most salad you eat you don't feel gross and unhealthy after eating here.    Place is very clean and a great and friendly staff. Only compliant is they charge a ton for cheese... Was this review ...?
Adriel H.,"Danville, CA",281,108,9,3.0,7/12/2010,"In general,  there is a wide variety of appetizers, entrees and cheesecakes to select from, making it appealing to almost everyone.   There is a large interior and plenty of seating, a full bar, and plenty of parking.  There are heaters outside so you can still sit outside in the winter. First time i went here with a friend, we sat outside, and the waiter service was terrible.  It was at 3 pm, which was when there weren't many people eating at the time, which made it inexcusable that the waiter take 25 minutes before he took our order and then we had to wait another 40 minutes for the food to come.  He only checked up on us once, and we had to wait again for the check.  I ordered a pasta dish and it was only ok.  This experience deserved a 1 star. I went again with two different friends, and sat inside in a booth.  The decor is pretty nice, the tile floors make it look classy, and the entrance is a little grand.  The waiter was much better this time, and the food was also better.  The onion rings were delicious, and the kobe burger was good.   This visit deserved a 4 star"
John L.,"Montgomery, AL",0,23,1,4.0,12/9/2011,"Thanks for being so yummy, CCF! Heavy, oversized... okay there, I said it, but frankly, those are the better issues than those at the other end of the spectrum. For a chain behemoth, I gotta admit: they do a phenomenal job decorating the inside, its ambiance is cool, and it's just fun to go with friends. It's one thing to dislike something because you feel so many people are accrediting it more than you think they should, but to its credit, CCF serves its niche in the realm of restaurants. So thanks again P-town Cheesecake for continuing to serve as a once-in-a-while hotspot for me and my friends. Love ya."
Bibi B.,"Palo Alto, CA",75,11,3,3.0,7/29/2010,"I've always loved going to the cheesecake factory because of their great selection of food. They are spacious and their outdoor patio is great during summer. I was excited to sit down and enjoy my usual coke and sourdough bread, which they were unfortunately out of. Luckily I was happy with the other bread. We were ready to order and I was debating between the club sandwich and Rene's special. They were somehow out of BOTH OF THEM ! we ended up sharing the white pizza and some chicken wings. It was okay.... I didn't enjoy my lunch so much. Our waitress was very sweet but the service was a bit slow. i guess it was busy? not so much. I've definitely had better times at cheesecake. 3 stars."
carrie r.,"Livermore, CA",52,82,,2.0,8/7/2012,"The cheesecake factory is like childbirth. The only reason I return to try it again is because I must have forgotten how horrible the experience was last time. Every time it is the same deal: show up and be told we'd be seated in 50 minutes. Not 60 min or 70 mins but over 90 mins later we are finally seated (that is 40 over what try quoted!), it takes 20 mins to get drinks once we are FINALLY seated, and then another hour to get food. If at that point you want to enjoy the cheesecake that will take another 20-30 mins to arrive to your table. Ugh! and worst of all no one ever apologized or acknowledged how long and late everything was which leads me to believe this is their norm. I did give 2 stars because of the wide selection and the food is decent."
John D.,"San Ramon, CA",0,16,17,4.0,1/25/2014,My favorite is the Skinnylicious Chicken Asian salad with the free Wheat bread YUMMY.  Wait for a table was 30 minutes but worth the wait
Michael O.,"Oakland, CA",0,36,27,2.0,7/30/2012,"My review is based on National Cheesecake Day. Today is National Cheesecake day and I remember hearing that cheesecake at the Cheesecake Factory would be half price.  Well, that's only if you dine in. What!  I want to go home, kick my feet up and enjoy my cheesecake with my family.  You mean to tell me, I have to sit here and eat it to get it half price!  That's ridiculous!  When we came for National Cheesecake Day last year, we didn't have to dine in to get it half off.  I'm upset that this business would do this. I guess my cheesecake days are over. Thanks Cheesecake Factory!"
Suzy S.,"Hayward, CA",282,626,134,2.0,10/2/2010,"OK, I recommended the Happy Hour Mon-Fri, 4-6pm. The $5 Mojito was good! That's where this positive Happy Hour review ends. After sipping on our tall cool drinks we were ready for some munchies and opted for the Guacamole - customized to your liking. We were given a choice of mild, medium or spicy. I suspected that ""spicy"" wouldn't be too spicy and that was an understatement. After ordering and waiting 25 minutes for the guac to come out our glasses were empty and so were our stomachs. What arrived was a hugely chunky (aka not mashed ), hard, dry, bland guacamole, made with unripe avocados. Even hubs, who hates spice, suggested that perhaps she heard mild instead of spicy. After a couple of bites we sent it back to get ""spiced"". When our dish returned it looked like it had been mixed up a bit but after one bite we wondered if that's all that happened. Still no taste. We went to the bar and asked for a few slices of lime, doctored our guac with lime juice and salt. OK, it wasn't close to homemade but we ate it anyway and swore never to order that again. We just chalked it up to a bad day in the kitchen.  Our young server was pleasant but didn't really know how to handle a complaint so she just avoided us for the next half hour. After begging for our check and waiting again for her to be our cashier we weren't particularly happy with happy hour.  Waiting is a common thing here but it's usually for a table not for service. All in all the food here in the past has been good but it might be a long while before we weaken and stop here again after shopping at Happy Hour!"
Jo A.,"Livermore, CA",0,14,,2.0,12/12/2015,"We waited close to one hour for a table and were quite hungry by the time we were seated @ 7pm. Julio was our server who started off as attentive & informative as it was our first time eating here. We ordered Jamaican Shrimp, Kobe burger & Chicken Madera. The drinks & food were very good. We also ordered the salted caramel cheesecake but were told they were out. The Taramisu was suggested to us so we chose that. I was very disappointed that the cheesecake served to us was frozen and difficult to cut with the teaspoons given to us. I tried to flag our server down three times but was not able to get his attention. I thought the Cheesecake Factory was famous for the freshness & quality of the cheesecakes served! This grand finale to our meal was quite the disappointment. We also tried to get our drinks refilled but was not able to get that either. I know it was busy last night but the service could have been better."
Maggie L.,"Berkeley, CA",40,104,39,4.0,9/9/2010,"My boyfriend loves Cheesecake Factory and always suggests it whenever we try to make dinner plans. I, on the other hand, am pretty impartial. I think their food is alright. Service has never been bad. I love ordering their strawberry lemonade (And if you read any of my other reviews, you'll know that I love lemonade anything). This lemonade is more special though, because there's sugar on the rim of the cup, mmm. I've tried a lot of their appetizers and entrees here because of my boyfriend's insistence of going here all the time.  None of them really stood out to me as super, but just average in general. A lot of it is really greasy. The bread is alright. I love the cheesecake here, but after eating the entree, I seldom would have room for any dessert.  But if YOU have room, try out the red velvet cheesecake, it's to die for! 4 stars for never ruining my night, the nice staff, prompt service, delicious cheesecakes, yummy strawberry lemonade, and winning my boyfriend's heart. :)"
