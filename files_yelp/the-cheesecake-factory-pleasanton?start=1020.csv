Nikki C.,"East Bay, CA",1790,409,785,3.0,4/2/2010,"My review is based on their Happy Hour only.   I recall their Happy Hour a few years ago being much better than it is now!  I've also dined here several times for lunch & dinner and would give them 4 stars for that but for Happy Hour they get 3 stars & I'm being generous. * Limited seating at bar area & the outside patio does not count as ""bar seating"" * 4p to 6p (seriously, what's happy about that?!) * Appetizer selections are good, drink specials are not * Slow service Recommended Happy Hour selections: * Ahi Tartare * Shrimp Summer Rolls * Chicken Pot Stickers * BEER - great draft selections but not many specials on cocktails.  Our waiter also had no clue what wine selections were part of Happy Hour even though it was listed on the menu. ($5 each) Pass on the Margherita pizza - tastes like cheese bread & nothing more.  BJ's Happy Hour Margherita pizza is on a heavenly flatbread crust, bigger in size, and much better overall.  We also ordered a last round of drinks (a few mins after 6pm) and our waiter pointed out it wasn't happy hour anymore.  Funny how he was quick to notice that but slow w/everything else! We had a great time and in the end walked out w/a good buzz but also a pretty hefty bill.  If Happy Hour ended at 7pm & they include the outdoor area for seating then I'd be willing to reconsider. BETTER Happy Hour destinations in the tri-valley: TGIF, Casa Orozco, Chevy's, and Alberto's Cantina."
Chung W.,"Stockton, CA",9,49,5065,5.0,8/30/2010,"Saturday night, my friend & I had dinner at this restaurant, in order to make sure I finish new cake, Reese's Peanut Butter Chocolate cake, I requested my dinner, Carlton's Salad, one of next month's new items, ( all kinds of fruits with raisins) served with it at the same time.  I loved the cake even though I am not a Peanut Butter fan and the Salad, it is the BEST one I ever tasted in my life, because of cake, I had to bring home 3/4 of it and yesterday, the left over tasted as good as the night before, little bit soggy of course because of Romaine lettuce.  I am planning on having the same Salad again this Saturday."
Richie C.,"San Ramon, CA",155,191,217,5.0,8/13/2010,"THIS REVIEW IS STRICTLY FOR THEIR RED VELVET CHEESECAKE!!! OH EM GEE!!! Seriously?? Is anyone else with me on this one?  The Red Velvet Cheesecake is absolutely pure bliss.  Orgasmic even!! Am I allowed to say that?  I have to admit, the slices have gotten smaller and smaller over time.  But I'd still pay a pretty penny for a slice.  If you're one of the millions of people who say you'll never go to Cheesecake Factory, I urge you to go just for a slice of this cheesecake.  Don't even sit down! Order it to go.  Either way, just get your paws on a slice!!!  BEWARE: 1 slice of this goodness will cost you 1250 calories!!!"
Hasan K.,"Tracy, CA",9,60,4,2.0,4/2/2013,"I came here with a rather large party to celebrate my moms birthday and we went at 6 knowing we would wait about an hour till we would get seated however it took us almost close to 3 hours till we were called hoverer the party that was going to be leaving were starring at us and did not get up and leave even though they were done with there food( talking about those stuck up people), but staff was nice and did as much as they could. So we ate at about close to 9 45."
Wendy K.,"Oakland, CA",18,72,140,3.0,2/26/2013,"A-OK, yeah, that's right, A-OK. I guess they call it, ""THE Cheesecake Factory"" for a reason; they specialize in cheesecakes. I think I've only been here a handful of times and most of it was to get their cheesecakes, which NEVER failed me.  I came here the other night for dinner. I ordered the Jambalaya pasta, their most popular pasta dish. My friend also recommended it to me because she had tried it before and said it was actually pretty good. My pasta came out and the first thing I noticed was the heaping tower of noodles and the LACK of sauce. It was soooo dry! It also came with chicken and shrimp. The chicken was moist, but flavorless. The shrimp (the few I found), was decent. I was not satisfied with this dish at all! Towards the end, our waitress came by to check up on us. I told her about my pasta and she got the manager. The manager quickly came and I told him about my dissatisfaction with my dish. He told me that it's common to have the noodles absorb the sauce because they give about 7oz of noodles. Yes, I do know noodles absorb sauce, but come on now, unless my dish has been sitting in the kitchen for a while, it shouldn't absorb that quickly! My dish was so sauce-less that it wasn't even glistening when it came out. It was seriously so BLAND. The manager was nice about it and did ask if I wanted to replace it. I was full, so I declined. He ended up taking my dish off the bill, though. If i ever come back, I'll only come back for the cheesecake because they really DO have good cheesecake!"
Paul F.,"Tracy, CA",41,36,,5.0,7/10/2012,"Very good service.  Went here for my girlfriends birthday.  The inside is quite beautiful, very clean.  No wait time, as we went in around 11:30.  Our server was quite friendly and knowledgeable about their menu, which, if you have ever dined here, you will know this is no small feat as it is a huge menu.  The food was amazing, ordered a chicken dish, can't remember the name, but it is advertised as their most popular chicken dish, and the girlfriend got salmon.  If you find yourself at Stoneridge, check it out, great resturant.  Oh, and the cheesecake...if you want to know why they call themselves the Cheesecake Factory, then go in and just have that.  Tiramisu and Ultimate Red Velvet cheesecakes are beyond amazing."
Nathan M.,"South Lake Tahoe, CA",82,291,,4.0,3/11/2013,"I was expecting it to be overpriced averageness, but I was actually quite satisfied with the food.  The popcorn shrimp is a tad oily, but features a light batter.  Evelyn's Favorite Pasta is served in a generous portion and is actually quite easy to lap up.  Chris' Outrageous Cheesecake is delicious and one huge slice of it is enough for four people to share as a dessert.  The decor is a bit Vegas/mall Italianate stylized.  Overall, consider sharing an entree with a mate in order to save enough room for some cheesecake at the end."
Christina Z.,"Oakland, CA",18,170,,4.0,3/4/2013,"Came here for lunch with mom after a couple hours shopping. The wait was 35-45 minutes so we decided to take a look around the bar area which we then found a couple leaving. The busboy came quickly to clear off the table and brought us utensils and a menu. We ordered 3 small dishes (Chicken samosas, the crab and artichoke dip, and the ahi tartare) and a lunch portion entree (miso salmon). Only complaint was the bread accompanying the artichoke dip. They were so hard, I felt like I was chewing on rocks. The waitress was attentive to our refills of our waters and strawberry lemonades. Great place to stop for a bite during shopping hours."
Stacey W.,"Alameda, CA",357,141,83,1.0,2/18/2008,"I've gone to the cheesecake factories in Seattle, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and San Jose... and I must say this is the WORST one. The food quality is horrible, cold, too salty, and the service is slow. I recommend going to the one in the city if you want the full whole experience, I mean at least the city has a view you can enjoy since you are going to wait anyways.  the cheesecake... you cannot complain about over 30 or whatever variety of cheesecake they offer. my favorite is the chocolate sundae..i believe keep asking for bread.. one of my favorite lunch items is the incredible eggplant sandwich, and i'm not even a vegetarian"
Megan V.,"Oakland, CA",4,174,,3.0,2/2/2013,"Three and a half is about right.  We usually don't like chain restaurants, but we'll make an exception for Cheesecake Factory, mostly because they have a decent bar.  Oddly enough we're not a big fan of the cheesecake, so we stick to other items.  We usually have sandwiches and some salads, and generally have never been disappointed."
H M.,"San Ramon, CA",15,101,6,4.0,5/17/2013,The miso salmon dinner plate is good. The key lime cheesecake is fresh and tasty. Long wait on the weekends.
Matt T.,"Dublin, CA",0,64,9,3.0,4/29/2013,"It's consistent, I'll at least say that. If you like their food, you'll be pleased. I personally find their food to be a little on the heavy/greasy side and not very original. It's good, but not great. They have a famously huge menu, so if you have a big group, everyone will find something they like. The worst part about this location is their take-out service. Totally under-staffed and inept. The ""curbside-to-go"" never works and you eventually have to just walk into the restaurant and wait in line with everyone ordering on the spot to get something you pre-ordered 30 minutes ago. They need to get their act figured out or just stop offering take out. Take a lesson from CPK next door - they do take out better than anyone I've seen yet."
Dora C.,"Fremont, CA",778,227,35,1.0,4/7/2012,"The food was just like any other Cheesecake Factory I've ever been to, so food was clearly not the issue.  My friends and I waited for about 2 hours to get a table.  It was packed!  Once we sat down, the waiter took forever getting our drinks ordered.  During my meal, I asked a nearby waiter if I could get more water, she rudely responded ""This is not my table."" WOW!  This is your restaurant! Your job is to cater the needs of a guest!  I don't understand how and why she said that, but this made me have a bad impression on Stoneridge's Cheesecake Factory."
Max-Adam A.,"San Leandro, CA",578,197,52,1.0,1/25/2012,"When you hear the name Cheesecake Factory, you immediately think of their cheesecake, right? Besides their signature cheesecakes, they also have other great desserts, drinks and food.   Moving on....Last Saturday, I experienced probably the WORST.CUSTOMER.SERVICE.EVER! We arrived and were told that the wait would be an hour.  Sure, no problem.  One hour is nothing...We got the name on the list, pager handed to us. We left for a little bit and came back...Went up to the podium and ask how much longer the wait would be, I was told 20 minutes.  As part of my routine, I look around to see who was there before me and who was there after me.  20 minutes had passed and all of a sudden I see other people who came after me being seated.  Wait, what? This isn't right.  Like anyone else would do, I'm going to question this.  I asked ""these people were seated before us and they came way after us"" ...here's what was said to me ""I'm sorry, there was a bit of a confusion.""  CONFUSION? People on a waiting list are put on a list and given a pager, what the heck was the confusion about? How can you mess that up? After another hour wait, we were finally seated.  But the poor service doesn't stop there.  After we ordered our food and it was given to us, we asked for Parmesan cheese.  I watched that waiter go to the waiter podium, talk to his co-workers for about 15 minutes and as soon as he was walking towards us, I flagged him down.  He looked at me and said ""oh, the Parmesan cheese"" ...said it as dull and unapologetic as he could.   A waitress came to our table after of few minutes of eating and asked if everything was ok.  I asked for 3 straws and here again, she walks away and wasn't seen for the next 10-15 minutes.  When she came back, she asked if everything was ok and I told her no.  Informed her that we're still waiting for the straws. She apologized and came back ....with dirty straws. Usually straws are wrapped up in their little paper holder, but these were not! ALL straws were dirty on BOTH ends!! What's going on here?! The manager on duty was informed by the waitress that we were having a horrible experience.  The manager came to our table and apologized for everything and the reasoning for it was because ""its been really busy.""  Regardless if you're busy or have 3 people in there, customer service needs to be top notch! Customer Service needs to be the focus! It really didn't seem like it was a focus at all.  I let her know the problems we had and the huge lack of customer service from her staff.  So her compensation to us, not that we were expecting one, was priority seating on our next visit.  How displeasing is that?  How can you even guarantee that?  So the next time we come in you're going to seat us before anyone else because of our bad customer service experience?  Do you realize that this will cost you other customers to be upset as well? Not only at your staff but at us for being seated before them.   I don't understand and don't know how this place in this specific city got soo bad.  We came here a lot, I came here with friends a lot. It's within driving distance but it seems like I will need to patronize other CF restaurants in other cities or just not even give them my business at all.  Very, very, very disappointed with this staff at this location..."
Ed C.,"San Lorenzo, CA",219,249,153,2.0,12/30/2007,"Appetizers = Good Entrees = Crap Cheesecakes =  Awesome It seems that I have reviewed this formula in head numerous times, however I always end up ordering an entree here.  Why?  Maybe because having to wait 45 minutes to be seated plays trick on your mind and you get sooooooooo hungry, you forget that all their entrees taste like fried cardboard.  Either way, my girlfriend and I always fall into that trap. The Cheesecake Factory does have some delicious appetizers.  I recommend the Ahi Tempura Rolls.  Those are the Mrs.'s and my favorite (we usually order 2).  The cheesecakes are also a must have, obviously.  Try the tiramisu cheesecake. All of the entrees are over-priced and bland.  I recommend a salad or maybe pasta (add salt!). All in all, just another franchise restaurant chain.  Blah."
Lizzie B.,"San Francisco, CA",115,105,66,4.0,1/27/2013,"We always seem to come here when we shop at Stoneridge Mall. It's always busy especially on the weekends, so it's really nice to be able to have the bar to hang out in. I haven't had any problems so far, good service, even when we're in a big group. Waiters are friendly, always attentive."
Chi N.,"Union City, CA",23,219,108,4.0,12/29/2010,"We came here tonight for an office outing to celebrate the end of the year. And boy was it CROWDED. We had our eye on a specific table, but when the hostess realized they weren't going to leave anytime soon she came up and offered another similar table, which was great. We all ordered different drinks, I had a cosmo, (delish!) and ordered a bunch of appetizers: Stuffed Mushrooms (YUM YUM, not enough though) Dynamite Shrimp (decent, not wonderful) Buffalo Blasts (a blast of buffalo for sure) Fried Calamari (a little limp and bland) Fried Mac n Cheese Balls (the star of the table) Fried Corn Fritters (too much batter) Avocado Rolls (I don't eat avocado but everyone seemed to enjoy it) All in all, food was great. Service was awesome."
Elan D.,"San Leandro, CA",4,14,,1.0,8/11/2010,"Is this a restuarant witrh a mission statement like crash! The food, a petit filet mignon, was so poorly prepared it was embarressing . My guest had a short period of time to get something to eat and go to work, so I didn't choose to bother with complaining to the manager. We had complained about another dish (onion rings) earlier so I thought just call it a bad food day and leave. The servers were cool people. Thier attention and good humor was great."
Marilyn. E.,"Sugar Land, TX",8,153,1,4.0,7/23/2012,We enjoyed the crispy crab bites and the pizza and pastas were pretty good too!  Kudos to our server Jennifer and her team for the wonderful service and to Manager Nancy for keeping my leftovers cold for me while we shopped.
Lisa C.,"San Francisco, CA",440,552,396,4.0,5/16/2010,"Who knew the bang bang chicken and shrimp can be so good? I think I'm just drawn to the shredded sprinkled-on coconut flakes.  Made two meals out of this dish. Ooooo...and if you absolutely have to get a piece of cheesecake, you must try Stefanie's Ultimate Red Velvet.  Usually with red velvet the cream cheese frosting can be a little overwhelming, but the cheesecake version came with 2 layers of red cake between 2 layers of original cheesecake covered with a thin layer of cream cheese frosting on thee edge. The cheesecake and cake made for a better combo than the cake with the frosting! Regardless how guilty I felt with each bite, needless to say, I enjoyed sharing every bite of it with my friend.  Came during a weekday right before the dinner rush and service was prompt."
