Brenna R.,"Livermore, CA",80,129,28,1.0,1/9/2013,"Boo gluten free here sucks, I went with my sister thinking with their giant menu I could find something gluten free, I had a couple options, they were out of one, the goat cheese salad with beets, so I asked for the spring rolls with rice paper. The waitress came back and said they had no rice rolls left, but asked if I wanted the crispy ones, which DUH have gluten in them. I say no thanks to cheese am factory."
Jessica L.,"El Cerrito, CA",737,909,29,3.0,1/9/2010,"Huge open location. Tough parking with the mall location. Lunch here is great - good portions and service. I can't tell you my tip to get seated fast and in and out in less than an hour....bc then, I won't be able to. For some reason their salads ROCK - I'll be back for more lunches and a happy hour!"
Melissa T.,"Fremont, CA",285,689,138,2.0,9/4/2007,"Once again, I am forced to slam a Cheesecake Factory (which is one of my favorite chains. d'oh!)... I went here with a friend on Saturday. We knew it would be busy and knew they don't take reservations, so we decided to meet at an odd dinner time. We put our names in at 4:30 and were promised a 15-30 min wait. It was swelteringly hot...and there was no room to wait indoors for the first 10 mins... by the time I cornered myself into a niche of standing-room-only space in the waiting area, I realized how extraordinarily noisy this location is. It's just LOUD.  Fast forward to minute 40 of our wait for a table for two............ we get seated in hands down the worst seat in the place. You know, one of those half bench/half chair tiny tables on the other side of a cash register, kitty corner to the kitchen? Yeah, that worst table. We are visibly displeased with our table but the waitress walks off. The first thing we notice is the filthy silverware settings. I'm not just talking spotty and questionably washed but THERE IS RICE STUCK TO THE FORK. Gross. The couple that is seated in the table next to us (aka the second worst table) makes a similar remark at THEIR filthy silverware. It's a great start. So we decide to stay and order even though we're pretty disgusted/annoyed with the noise, filth, location and wait... because well, we invested 40 minutes in this shitty table. Service was slow. Very very slow. We were offered 1 drink refill and it took about 15 minutes to make its way to the table, and then it was the wrong drink. The pasta dish my friend ordered was made incorrectly and when I told the waitress I was done with my dish and to please take it away, she boxed it up instead. Our desserts were also very slow to be delivered, although tasty (the one thing that can always be depended upon at any Cheesecake Factory)... and then we eagerly paid the bill and shuffled out. I think it's unfortunate that so many decent chains like this allow their mall locations to have such sub par service....."
Ariyonne M.,"Oakland, CA",49,11,4,2.0,7/20/2010,"The best part of my experience was the waiter Ahmad he was very knowledgeable and friendly.  As for the food... blah, blah, blah bland with too much decoration. I ordered the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp as an entree and it was almost inedible. It sounds really good on the menu, but then you get it and you're like what is all of this crap in front of me. The Shrimp and chicken were in a bland curry sauce BURIED in Toasted Coconut. I'm not over exagerating when I say buried, I REALLY MEAN BURIED! Not a light sprinkling which would have been fine and added a nice texture, but I mean they buried all the possible goodness of the dish under six feet of coconut! Gross!!! On a good note, I did enjoy my Banana Cream Cheesecake, but in all honesty how wrong can you go with Cheesecake.  GO FOR THE CHEESECAKE NOT THE FOOD!"
Robert C.,"San Leandro, CA",16,257,24,4.0,9/3/2012,A good place to have dinner. a must for cheese cake lovers tell me if you cann find better cheese cake and dont say whole foods.
Danny W.,"San Ramon, CA",2,7,,3.0,9/14/2014,"I really enjoy this place and always have good service, but when I was there today I was in the bathroom the same time as the manager and he didn't wash his hands after emerging from a stall...makes me wonder if they value cleanliness."
Mike N.,"Brentwood, CA",99,265,134,3.0,1/18/2010,"What ever happened to the days of driving out to SF for this place and enjoying an awesome dinner rooftop style? As the chain grows, the quality drops. I used to love this place but as of lately the food has been coming up short. The desserts will always be decent, but I'm not a cheesecake person."
Yelper Y.,"Berkeley, CA",58,97,28,1.0,3/10/2007,"Take-out...Absolutely disgusting!  The chicken was burned, see for yourself.  First they forgot the bread, then after I reminded them, they gave me stale bread.  & 2 pieces for 3 entree orders.  They forgot to put in butter, utensils, napkins.  The chicken marsala consisted of oil, & very little marsala wine taste.  Overall, the worst cheesecake factory experience ever.  I've been a Cheesecake Factory fan, but this was my first time at the Stoneridge Mall one.  The one in S.F. is good, but over-crowded (long waits).  The Stoneridge Mall one sucks & I will not be returning.  Burned chicken?  I mean, c'mon now. Update:  07/10/07 Tried take-out again, forgot utensils again.  Forgot the bread again.  The orders were good. Tried it a third time, forgot utensils again.  Forgot the bread AGAIN!!! Entrees were good. Tried it a fourth time, this time I made sure to tell them OVER AND OVER AND OVER, please please please pretty pretty please, don't forget the bread.  They didn't.  But they forgot I was there.  So when I called to say that I was there to pick-up curbside, they had me wait 15 mins.  So I called again, & the girl just said, ""Oh, they didn't give me the message that you were out there."" Good for cravings, bad for patience."
Linda M.,"Hayward, CA",414,607,165,2.0,6/11/2007,"I just don't get it.  Why is there a ridiculous wait at every Cheesecake Factory everywhere? We arrived around 6:00 on a Saturday evening, party of five.  Had some shopping to do, so put our names in and were told to check back in an hour to get our buzzer.  In an hour, we got our buzzer and were told we were 5th in line, and it would probably be 5-10 minutes.  20 minutes later, we're told we are ""next"".  We didn't get called for another 20 minutes after that.  What's frustrating is that you want to leave and go somewhere else, but you think, ""We've waited this long, it should be any minute... it would be stupid to leave now""  And then you wait and wait and wait some more. Honestly, I can't think of any place that would be good enough to waste this much of our valuable time, but if there were such a place, this wouldn't be it.  The food is mostly good.  The service is mostly good.  But it's really not exceptional.  Someone please tell me what is the attraction?  Thank you."
Danny L.,"Oakland, CA",551,337,174,4.0,11/23/2009,"Yummy Cocktails, good food, a delicious cheesecake and excellent service!!!  What more could you ask for on a Sunday afternoon?!   I always go with either the Cajun Ribeye steak (marinated for 36 hours in deliciousness), the jambalaya, or the Herb crusted salmon.  All of which are very good.  I've sampled the others on the menu but these three dishes just keep calling my name.   The fresh strawberry cheesecake A LA MODE!!!  These things are like crack! Can't resist no matter how full I am.  They also have a new cheesecake on their menu....   ""THE RED VELVET Cheesecake."" All I can say is wow!  That is G-O-O-D!!!"
Lisa B.,"Redwood City, CA",14,9,1,3.0,4/22/2013,"Meh.  Ordered the hawaiian pizza.  Was non-descript and soggy in the middle.  If you're going to do a thin crust, make sure you know what you're doing."
Ken Z.,"Bakersfield, CA",13,119,48,3.0,8/25/2012,"My wife and I had lunch there today. We were greeted and seated right away. Our first server was Jennifer, she was nice but then we were switched to a different server who was male and he gave excellent service. I really wished I knew his name but he was young and probably of Spanish nationality. He noticed that we didn't have bread and asked us if we wanted bread. We didn't know if everyone gets a small basket mixed with assorted bread but we noticed that every table around us had it, do maybe Jennifer forgot about it. We ordered the Ahi Car-pa-chio and it was terrific. I ordered the Monterey burger with bacon and it was great but they forgot to add the bacon which was fine because our new server was fast to fix that, and he was very aware if we needed anything else plus he smiled with every refill. As we were walking out we decided to pick up a few slices of pie Togo. We looked for what we wanted and stood there waiting to be asked if we were ready to order (there was no one in line but there were other employees standing in front of the register conversing with one another). I didn't mind cause maybe they were talking about work related things, or maybe not. After they all broke away I walked up to the lady behind the register and asked her if she was the one I'm suppose to order from, she didn't greet me I had to pursue her, Lol. Then we payed, picked up the Togo and left. I only gave 3 stars because our 2nd server gave us excellent service and all of our food was on point and good. Hopefully for our next visit we can give five stars."
Barbie G.,"Pleasanton, CA",0,20,,2.0,7/30/2014,"Terrible experience today. Would give it one star, but it isn't normally this bad, so have them some credit for that.   Started out with terribly slow service then progressed to black curly hair in our marinara sauce. Next up, my son's pasta was so old, it was changing color."
Frank L.,"San Ramon, CA",0,8,,2.0,11/5/2014,Don't like your policy to not accept reservations after 5:30. We showed up at 6 and were told it would be 15 mins for a party of 11. After 45 mins we left. You are enjoying success but we will not come back.
May M.,"San Francisco, CA",17,13,,3.0,6/14/2012,"Like this place, the food us yummy and the staff is friendly BUT, and this is a BIG BUT, the wait for a table is HORRENDOUS! I wish they accepted reservations. I would rate it 4 stars but because of the long wait every. single. time. we go there, I docked it down to 3."
Langdon N.,"San Jose, CA",27,74,4,4.0,4/30/2010,"I just ate dinner here today, and I was very impressed for a cheesecake factory.  Our waiter was extremely friendly and pretty much all about our needs. I had sat through an hour of traffic, and he knew I needed a drink. He recommended the Georgia Peach since it was tasty but packed the punch without you tasting it. He was also extremely helpful with picking out something to eat with some great recommendations.  I ordered the Chicken Pana and it was delicious! Great portion size, especially if you are trying to watch your weight. There is minimal cream sauce in order to reduce the calories and the chicken is breaded with a fantastic texture! The broccoli and potatoes are a great compliment to the dish.  I also had the red velvet cheesecake. DAMN. That's all I have to say. It was so good and I definitely recommend it. It is a pretty hefty slice and it's really rich in tastes, so I recommend sharing it with someone.  Overall great Cheesecake Factory. Next time you're here, ask for the ""Asian Waiter"", he's a boss."
Donna L.,"San Ramon, CA",0,59,2,3.0,3/27/2011,"We have Sunday brunch here every few weeks. With its giant menu, CF has something for everyone, but it may take you a while to find your fave. After numerous misses, I usually stick with the lunch-size everything pizza (with kalamatas) and salad (balsamic dressing on the side).  Hub likes the breakfast burrito and the Cajun pasta. Kiddo would be happy with just the bread and butter, but since portions are huge, we can get some of our ""real food"" in her without feeling deprived. Service is generally efficient and pleasant, though sometimes a little pushy. I'm always happier with a booth off to the side, as opposed to a table in the chaotic central area, but with a place this busy, you take what you can get."
Nga D.,"Danville, CA",0,13,11,1.0,2/9/2012,"I am very disappointed. Took forever on taking our order as well as bringing out our food.. I order the garlic noodle and it was very salty, did not taste any garlic.. I use to love going to this place but w/ today experience I will not return (maybe only for their cheesecake to go) ;("
Sylvia F.,"New Bern, NC",12,199,473,4.0,10/9/2010,"We got there shortly before the lunch hour began but it was still pretty full already.We were seated right away. Our waitress took our drink orders and was back with them 5 minutes later. We ordered our meal.I ordered the fried chicken sandwich with frys while my sister was being healthy minded, and ordered one of their amazing salads.I think she got the oriental one. Our meal was at our table PIPING hot not 10-ish minutes later! Be sure to look at my pics of our food, cause presentation was excellent! I am not being nice here, only truthful. That was THE BEST chicken sandwich I've ever had! THe chicken was very moist and juicy yet the crispy coating was extreamly hot and CRUNCHY! GO-O-O-O Team! The frys were quite good to. The salad my sister ordered was beautiful, and she said it tasted great. I would go here again and again.For nothing other than that darn sandwich. I'm drooling now just thinkin' about it!"
Will K.,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",8,14,,4.0,8/12/2014,"Good experience on our most recent visit.  I came here for a b-day celebration for our daughter, and brought along the parents.  After the usual expected 40 min wait, we were seated in a less-noisy area of the restaurant, between the restrooms and the kitchen.  Our server was attentive, and provided us with enough bread to satisfy the carb-eaters at the table (including my daughter).  Although our calamari appetizer did come in after our entrees, we were notified of the delay beforehand and were comped on the appetizer, which was a nice gesture.  I ordered the shrimp/chicken gumbo with brown rice, which tasted good.  My wife had her usual bistro shrimp pasta, which she smartly ate about a third (and saved the rest for leftover lunch and dinner).  After a few years of staying away from this location because of so-so experiences, this latest visit has been more than pleasant.  We will no longer have to avoid this location for the Walnut Creek one (which is nicer and bigger, but the wait is horrible).   1.5 stars - food 1.5 stars - service 1 star -parking, location"
