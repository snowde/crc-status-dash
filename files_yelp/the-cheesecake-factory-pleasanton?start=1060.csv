Belle U.,"Manteca, CA",2,33,3,4.0,7/27/2013,"I would want to give this 3.5 stars, so I'm being generous giving it a 4. The restaurant is super nice and it's beautiful on the inside. The only thing I did not like was our waiter. He just seemed to be in a horrible mood and did not treat my family and I with care or respect. He just looked like he was in a ""whatever"" mood. Besides him, this place does have good food. It's just a little too pricey though. So this place is good if you are going on a date, but for casual eating, just save your money and go somewhere else."
donna y.,"San Ramon, CA",181,51,1,2.0,4/1/2010,"I think everyone and their mom was out tonight. I got there tonight around a little after 7ish. The wait for a party of 4 was about 40 mins or that's what they told us.  We sat down. Our server was pleasant. She takes our orders. Side salads were order and requested that they come out before the food. The thing is they never did. One said take the salad off our order and the other one still wanted their salad.  20 or so minutes of us placing our order, we get word that there is no more salmon. Yeah I know right? So my friend has to search over the menu to replace her meal.  More sitting and waiting. Finally our food comes out with what? Our salad. I think all of our food was room temperature. I sent mine back to get reheated. My friend ended up order some pasta dish that came out bland. Took like 2 bites and was done.  A different server came by while our original server went on break. My friend said she was done and took the plate and didn't really say anything about a full plate of food still on her plate.  The manger came out and said well we made our forecast today. I don't know how that was suppose to make us feel better with him telling us that and taking off 1 salad off our bill.  We ended up being there for over 2 hours for a party of 4 on a weeknight. Just thought that was sort of crazy...  Overall, tonight wasn't Cheesecake's night for us. Servers was meh, food was blah... yeah totally should of gone somewhere else"
Dee G.,"Hayward, CA",4,55,33,4.0,12/28/2012,"Stopped in after movie so the lunch crowd was gone and we only had about 10 minute wait.Cocktails were refreshing and we each had the Beet, Apple and Walnut Salad. Asked server how big the salad was and she said it was small and not quite enough for two, so we each had one. With the Firecracker Salmon appetizer as my entree, there was more than enough food for me. The surprise? 4 pieces of food and a HUGE mound of purple slaw. I took the food off the plate and sent back the HUGE mounds of slaw. The proportions were way off for the size of the salmon. There was a spicy bite to the salmon appetizers. Husband had the Cuban Sandwich with sweet potato fries. I like this place, it just takes me forever to decide what to eat."
Marla M.,"Livermore, CA",206,213,8,4.0,12/17/2009,"I've only had a drink here, but it was damn good. The bartender was very kind and enthusiastic, which I appreciate being in the industry! What I find stupid, is that the staff has to wear all white.  OBVIOUSLY, the owners, creators of the concept have never waited tables a day in their lives.. OBVIOUSLY! Poor staff!"
Theresa S.,"Hayward, CA",16,20,,5.0,4/12/2013,"Cheesecake factory update...after Twitting out CCF, CCF Corp. contact me regarding my side of the story and will address this issue with management and the server that morning..."
M T.,"South San Francisco, CA",0,199,,2.0,4/19/2012,"I have gone to a number of Cheesecake Factory restaurants in various locations in the past, and I have had good experiences. However, my experience at the Pleasanton Cheesecake Factory was not good.  I went with 3 other people on April 1, 2012, for lunch.  The wait for the table was about 15 minutes, close to the 10 minute estimate given to us by the front desk greeter.  Our waitress was very pleasant, but slow.  Perhaps she had a lot of tables to wait on and orders to take.  It took a LONG time for our bread basket to be delivered to our table.  During our meal, which also took a LONG time to be served, the waitress did not come back to see if we needed more iced tea and water. The meals were OK, but my wife's sweet potato fries and my niece's French fries were VERy salty.  So they ate almost none of their fries. I mentioned the saltiness to the waitress when she brought our check, and she said if we had told her earlier she would have brought replacement fries.  Shame on me for not complaining sooner.   What prompted me to write this, my first Yelp review, was the condition of the doggie box.  I was not feeling well during the meal, so ate only half my sandwich and only one or two small forkfuls of a fairly good size green salad that came with the sandwich and was on the same plate.  I asked for my meal to be boxed up.  When I opened the box for a light dinner, only the sandwich was in the box.  What gives the restaurant the right to decide I did not want the rest of my uneaten meal boxed up.  That really annoyed me."
Wendy T.,"Fremont, CA",110,471,115,4.0,6/27/2010,"LOved the ck and mushroom bowtie pasta with pancetta and sweet onion!! Also, best Kobe burger everywhere! It has shitake mushroom and  the burn taste and the juicyness, makes me not miss any sauce. I will definately try the ck marsala that's loaded with mushroom and Monte Cristo, and Luau salad, Kahlua Mudslide, Thai Chicken pasta, Chicken Piccata, shepherd's pie next time!"
Kathryn N.,"San Leandro, CA",10,23,,1.0,9/17/2011,"I've been eating at this location once a week for the last two years. But, the last three out of four times I've eaten at the Pleasanton location I've had food quality control issues and this last time, I actually got food poisoning! While I understand accidentally having one bad meal, and with really terrible luck possibly even two; but three bad meals in the span of just one month is NOT a coincidence!  My last four experiences: Meal 1: I ordered the BBQ Salmon, the mashed potatoes contained black moldy rotten potatoes. Luckily I noticed the mold before I ate the potatoes. Meal 2: We had a perfect meal. Meal 3: I ordered the Banana Cream Cheesecake (for my birthday), my  first bite of cake had paper in it. I checked the cake and there were small bits of bakery paper embedded all over the cake. We were brought a second piece, and before I took my first bite I checked to make sure there was no paper, and didn't see anything. But when I took a bite, there was paper in my mouth again! The paper was actually somehow INSIDE the cake. Not a pleasant end to my birthday dinner.  Meal 4: I really LOVE salmon, so (stupidly) I got up the courage and tried ordering the Salmon again. That was clearly a mistake, cause about two hours after eating it, I had food poisoning. (The food I ate at CF was the first thing I had eaten all day, nobody in my party ate anything on my plate, and out of my party only I was affected). I don't know why I've given Cheesecake Factory so many chances, I guess its because of all the good memories I used to have there. Not so much anymore."
Lindsay O.,"Castro Valley, CA",3,2,,4.0,1/9/2013,"Awesome food always but what makes this location stand out from others is the amazing customer service. Nicest hosts and waiters. Had the fish n' chips and they were bomb. The one downside was this particular trip, there was a lady with a PARROT sitting in front of me which decreased my appetite...not sure why they let animals in-or why this woman had such an attachment to a bird...but this was a one-time deal."
Wil G.,"Hayward, CA",98,308,95,5.0,7/15/2012,"Yes, this food is expensive but for a once in a while type of experience this is the place to go, the wait staff does a great job in keeping up with what you need, the food is pretty good and the cheesecake is awesome. This location is nice after a shopping trip and parking is fairly decent, you have to walk a country mile to get back to your car, but hey you just ate cheesecake right? The only drawback as with the higher end trendy restaurants is be prepared to wait, if they say ""20 minutes"" it actually means 40.. if they say ""40 minutes"" it actually means an hour and twenty minutes, so have your smartphone charged up or being a book, once seated though it's a fairly good dining experience... I love the one in Union SQ better though."
Alena W.,"Livermore, CA",456,576,353,3.0,2/15/2007,"I am re-doing this review because I have added to it so many times that it makes me look crazy.  Let's simplify: Good = BBQ Chicken Salad, Avocado Egg Rolls, Appetizer Platter, Steak Diane/Shrimp Scampi Combo, Shrimp Summer Rolls, Cuban Pork Sandwich Bad = Weight Management Salads, Service (sometimes), Curbside Pick-Up At first I was excited about this place, then I swore I'd never be back, then I received a couple gift cards and it's also close to my work.  So, in the end, I still look crazy, but at least my belly is full."
G P.,"San Ramon, CA",0,19,,1.0,8/2/2015,"This review is over two experiences over the last month and half. The first visit was uneventful except I left my card when I paid the bill. I realized this the next AM and called them they said they had the card and I was there in a few minutes to pick it up. The girl at the reception said you have to go to the take out area and ask them. The girl at that counter had no clue but said she would find out. After 20 minutes of back and forth with a variety of people one man came out asked my name and 2 mins later said ""we don't have it"". I then stressed to talk to manager bec they had already told me they had it. The manager then walked out and took card from his front pocket and gave it to me. The level of incompetence was striking. The girl at front then said to me ""oh I thought you were asking me about gift cards"". The final nail in coffin was a day later I was informed by my bank that my card had suspicious activity and was used by someone. I had to cancel it. Moral don't make mistake I did and leave your card. You don't know who is handling it in back and what they are doing with the info. The second visit was w a large group of 8 ppl and we were told it would be 45- 1 hr. We waited and 11/2 hrs later were told that they are waiting for a party to finish. My wife pressed the receptionist about the time and maybe they could find another area instead of just waiting for that one table to get up( there were several empty areas). Her response during that conversation was ""don't put words in my mouth"" I told you it would be a while. When we finally escalated our displeasure a nicer mature person came over and got us seated and eased the situation. The people they are hiring for the front reception area have the intelligence of a gnat and social skills and customer service is a concept they are clueless about. This is a busy place if I or ppl like me don't go anymore they won't care and prob don't but I am just writing this in  the hope that someone reads this and others look at it and go elsewhere. Don't even get me started on the slippery greasy floors."
Sara B.,"Dublin, CA",4,13,10,5.0,6/22/2013,"Good food, great service but they need to keep the floor dry and not greasy"
Angelina M.,"Tracy, CA",0,11,,1.0,3/20/2012,"I would rate this restaurant a zero.  The first time we went there, we had to wait 3 hours for a table.  So we stopped going there for dinner.  A year later, this was on March 3 on my husbands birthday, we decide to give it a try and guess what, we had to wait 4 hours for a table.  I had by 5 year old and my elderly parents with me, it was so sad that this place is so slow and unprofessional."
Aszure G.,"Manhattan, KS",15,98,121,5.0,7/30/2012,We went Sunday after church it was around 11 the service was very fast  we didn't have to wait long for anything it was excellent experience and I do believe that when we head back again that we will try for the same time. It was the first time I went with my kids and the kids menu had awesome prices!
Jennifer F.,"Livermore, CA",47,367,322,4.0,1/16/2007,"I love the Cheesecake Factory at Valley Fair and Oakridge Malls.  I was happy to find out that one was opening closer to home at Stoneridge. This particular restaurant seems much more smaller than the others I've been to.  There is outdoor seating with plenty of heaters though. Parking was a pain.  Waiting was a pain.  You can't really shop while waiting for your table- those pagers only work within 30 feet of the front door (according to the hostess).  They need more waiting area seating for all of us hungry people. The food was great, as usual.  My friend and I had ordered specials on the menu, which consisted of a half sandwich among other goodies.  For some reason, we were given full sandwiches at the half sandwich price.  No complaints here! The service was fine, nothing extraordinary.   I know I'll be back again, because it's so convenient.  Perhaps next time instead of waiting for a table, I'll order to go?  I think so..."
Antonella D.,"Oakland, CA",166,207,196,4.0,6/28/2010,I really like this place the food is good and they have sooo much on their menu to pick from. If you go before the lunch  or dinner rushes you wont wait for a table. The staff has always been really friendly and nice. Food is amazing. And yes you have to get dessert when you're there!   I love the inside of this place I love the art work on the ceilings and just the way it looks inside.  After along ay shopping at the mall you deserve to treat yourself to The Cheesecake Factory. They have a wonderful selection of cocktails also =). They also do take out you can call ahead and it will be all ready for you to take home!
Audra M.,"East Bay, CA",47,383,538,5.0,6/27/2012,This review is based on this specific cheesecake factory and their Skinnylicious menu. They have the best options for those who are trying to watch what they eat. The portions are incredible and the flavors wow...doesn't feel like low calorie. I wish more restaurants would follow their footsteps and offer delicious menu options under 600 calories. My favorite are the shrimp tacos.
Herb H.,"Roseville, CA",177,152,167,3.0,6/27/2012,"The food here doesnt make me personally go WOW but the wedge salad is AMAZING and you cant go wrong with the cheesecake. I did spend $30 on a ribeye once and it was riddled with fat. Not too excited about that. Im giving them 3.5 stars since they do have some good meals on the menu but not for the price and the cheesecake, although amazing, isnt worth $8 a slice. I can go to a local bakery and get a bag full of goodies AND a slice of cheesecake for that price!"
Tina C.,"San Francisco, CA",203,468,154,4.0,5/27/2010,"Pros: +Exceptional service from host Michelle. Generally, I've received great service from the hostess to the waiter/waitress here. +selection on various entree items +very good cheesecake and tons to choose from +Happy Hour specials even though I never have time to attend +choose from indoor or outdoor seating, heat lamps provided if dining outside +takes multiple forms of payment Cons: -wait time, sometimes long, but this location isn't as bad as San Francisco where I've waited over 2 hrs! The most I've ever waited here was 20 minutes. -can be a bit windy outside, chairs had bird poop on them when I sat outside last time -they don't take reservations! boo!"
