Andy S.,"Dublin, CA",26,21,,4.0,2/8/2011,"The wait was over 2hrs long....but we got lucky as we ordered drink. More or less we weaseled our to get our table. The place was packed though. As for the service, excellent attention to our needs. The food was excellent. The only complaint I heard about the food was on the steak plate my buddy had. They cut up pieces of steak and he stated there was really not enough meat in there but it tasted good.  NOW THE CHEESECAKE! The banana cream cheesecake was fantastic. I am going back to get a pie only (for me :P) and have my little heart attack on a plate all by myself! That's how good it was..."
Steph L.,"Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune, NC",125,85,11,4.0,6/1/2010,"Now I've been here plenty of times but this review this time around was for the service.  We were able to grab a bar hi-top and lucky for us we got a great server, too! If you do stop in, be sure to ask for Kassandra D. She was more than accommodating to my finicky preggo indecisions (she was very agreeably sympathetic) and my friend's less than normal appetite with a portion adjustment.  Oh and she also introduced me to my NEW favorite sugary ending and maybe cuz it's named something great....""Stefanie's Red Velvet Cake Cheesecake""  You'll have to try it to be in love...oh and she hooked up the feta upon request...no skimping there!  4 stars for Kassandra's good day and good mood! :)"
Scott H.,"Dublin, CA",3,26,2,2.0,1/29/2012,"Decent food and excellent cheesecake, but not worth the wait unless you plan to go at 3pm on a Monday.  I suggest to go somewhere else."
Jess M.,"San Jose, CA",85,135,6,4.0,7/20/2010,"The only reason why I knocked off a Star was because our Waitress didn't come and help us after 20 minutes of sitting and waiting. However, everything was perfect.. the Red Velvet Cheesecake was to die for! You must get it even if you're full and just take it to go. The Staff was very friendly & we were seated as soon as we walked in."
Liana Christine A.,"Hayward, CA",392,57,135,4.0,6/20/2012,"A decent waiting time. Maybe around 30 minutes, but it's not too bad. The food is a bit pricey, but you pay for what you get. I had no problem with the service. Overall, a nice place to eat for any occasion. (:"
Janice F.,"Union City, CA",79,180,17,3.0,3/23/2010,"Random tip: The floors are really slippery so be careful as you walk to your table. (Maybe it's just me.) This is definitely a place that can makes it easy to rack up those calories. This restaurant has large serving sizes so you can share with a friend or take home the leftovers for a meal the next day. The bread is awesome, the pasta dishes are pretty good, and the cheesecakes are rich."
Jessica E.,"New Orleans, LA",41,24,64,4.0,8/6/2012,"I've come here multiple times, usually for birthdays and celebrations. The servers work so hard and are incredibly friendly. The food comes out fast and hot. It's delicious, although not a good place for a diet. There is always plenty of food to take home. The cheesecake is to die for, especially the oreo one. It's a great place!"
Katie M.,"Livermore, CA",44,67,1,4.0,6/5/2010,"Never had a bad meal here. It's BOMB. My favorite part has to be how long their menu is. They have such a wide range of appetizers, drinks, and entrees as well as desserts to select from--there's gotta be something for everyone. This place is always packed, probably because it's attached to the mall and it's so damn good.  I got the crab-wonton-wrap things from the appetizer menu--I would have made it my meal they were THAT good. Excellent sangria cocktail as well. Not a cheesecake fan myself but the apps and entrees have yet to disappoint. Service is usually good, and food comes out as prompt as it can when it's a full restaurant. Outdoor seating is nice, the bar is nice too, except for their pint-sized televisions."
Christopher W.,"Dublin, CA",40,27,4,4.0,7/18/2010,Pretty good food at a pretty good location. Although there tends to be a tremendous wait time sometimes when arriving during brunch or dinner but that is ok because they have a bar to attend to while waiting which is nice... - favorite would be the miso salmon over mash patatoes!
Donna S.,"Dublin, CA",102,63,1,2.0,6/11/2009,"I would again like to comment on the terrible service I received at the CCF.   My girlfriends and I spent quite a bit of money when we went to lunch there on Sunday. There was NO wait and NO ONE waiting in the waiting area for a table, so we stayed and chatted an hour after we were done eating. Well the bitch waitress kept coming over trying to shoo us out of there. She kept coming up under the guise of asking us if we wanted anything more, but after the last time she came, she tried to make a comment about us leaving. SO RUDE!!! There was no one waiting for a table, there were plenty of open tables around us, so just let us sit there and enjoy digesting our meal.  Food wise it was not any better, my chicken in my chicken sandwich was tough and i could barely bite through it, so I took it out and had a tomato sandwich. The only reason I gave that extra star was because their Sangria was hella good. I won't go back to this CCF for a while even if it is 5 minutes from my house. RUDE service then and now and gross food...3 strikes their out."
edward k.,"Ambler, PA",0,49,,4.0,7/2/2014,"I eat at Cheesecake Factories periodically as I travel for biz and they tend to be consistent. As I have said in other reviews, their key lime cheesecake dessert is downright orgasmic. Ate at this location last week at about 4pm, sitting at the bar. Food was good, service was decent (young Asian girl). Would go back again. Hey, it is Cheesecake Factory...no high expectations= no high disappointments, right? It is what it is."
Sun E.,Bay Area,529,153,1,1.0,5/7/2009,"No. No. No. We say NO to dining here. Short Warning Version: Box up your ""to go"" foods yourself. Long Version: Read initial review. Another one star story for you happy readers... My dear daughter truly does like the cheesecake served here. Yup, my sweet girl has sweet teeth. A few years ago when she graduated from school, she chose to  have a couple CF cheesecakes served as her special dessert. It was HER day and I gave her the OK (absolutely, with reservations due to past experiences here). The cheesecakes were ordered IN PERSON and a pick-up time  was set. On the party day, I called and was told we could pick up the  cheesecakes at any time. Shortly thereafter, my daughter drove to CF with her grandmas who were visiting form out of state. Great happy quality time together...ha, right. It was actually a disturbing and frustrating time for them. Whadda ya know they arrived at CF and there was no record of  our order...WTF? They waited for about 20 minutes while an employee got  the  cheesecakes prepared to go. The employee told them they'd be thawed and ready to serve for  our early afternoon party. Yay. Oh, oh...it was a Nay. One cut attempt into cheesecake numero uno and it was still very frozen. Shame on CF for raining on my daughter's special day. She was kind enough to give you another chance."
Kevin W.,"Dublin, CA",2,45,4,1.0,12/12/2012,There was a dead insect in my chicken fettuccine alfredo.  I disovered it at the bottom when I was packing the leftovers to go.  Mgr refunded me for this portion of my bill but I'm not going back.
M M.,"Chicago, IL",1,92,,4.0,8/11/2012,"My first visit to Cheese Cake Factory was in Columbus, OH back in 2003.  My co-workers and I loved it so much that we went back two weeks later.  Back in 2008 (or 2007), my friend and I went to Cheese Cake Factory in Pleasanton but I left there unimpressed.   Last weekend, I went there with a different friend of mine and I had Smokehouse B.B.Q. Burger and I had to same it was the best burger I had in a few years."
Jennifer S.,"Mountain View, CA",64,464,8,3.0,5/21/2012,"Came here on a Sunday and there was still a wait! We got an outdoor seat which was great because the weather was amazing.  I got the Thai chicken pasta which was mediocre because it was like a pad thai but worse.  My friend got two of the appetizers which were really great, grits and meat tacos.  The tacos were actually like the Chairman Bao food truck tacos with cucumbers and bbq meat, very impressive."
Mace M.,"San Lorenzo, CA",132,370,26,3.0,5/27/2009,"I'm just gonna break it down: + Quick seating, ZERO MINUTE WAIT @ 7PM!! + Quick service for drink orders and getting drinks + Iced green tea, probably one of the best iced green teas I've ever had - Server forgetting that we ordered an appetizer + Thai chicken pasta, not really authentic, but delicious and filling - Server forgetting all about us + Farfalle chicken w/ garlic, always good - Server forgetting that we wanted refills + Garlic noodles & shrimp, pretty good + Spicy cashew chicken, a bit salty, but super tasty The place is awesome in terms of space and style. The patio is perfect, especially because the weather in Pleasanton is always a few degrees warmer. Everything is super clean, the food is great. I didn't want to penalize them too much because I think our server was new, but new or not, we shouldn't be ignored either. I gotta give 'em three stars until I go back and make a final decision."
Marie R.,"Modesto, CA",0,5,,1.0,12/22/2013,"Terrible, terrible worst Cheesecake Factory ever. The food was lousy & not prepared as usual, & after one bite we had to send Food back. Sadly Mr. manager had no Customer Service skills with no sincere apology. We normally Love, love going to cheesecake & always look forward to their Boston House Salads & Shrimp Bistro Pasta, with Appetizors, but Nope not this time. The Salad was wilted & Pasta was terrible, lacking shrimp, flavor and ingredients. When we explained to the nice waiter, who sincerely apologized & took our plates, he then said he would send over his manager, who later came some 20min later. Sadly the manager couldn't have cared less about his job or Cheesecake Factorys Customer. We now had no Dinner or a sincere apology from the Manager who could have offered some type of solution or sincere apology for our lack of Dinner. Oops Double Whoops. My Family will never, ever return to this Cheesecake Factory! Two times now is too many disappointments for this location. The First time the small dark haired little Hostess was rude when we asked how long more for us to be seated, and this second and last time our Dinner or lack of Dinner was terrible, and Mr. manager had no care in the world that we wasted our Families Night here.  Overall, lately Cheesecake is getting played out. Fortunately San Jose Oakridge has not let us down so we may probably still go there or Walnut Creek but Overall sadly Cheesecake had lost long time Regular Customers!!!"
randal s.,"Pinole, CA",0,1,,1.0,8/13/2013,"had lunch on Saturday, Mar 2, 2013.  I had the Shrimp Tacos (3) which I shared with a co-diner that I had just met.  36 hours later we had ALL the symptoms of Norovirus and have been violently sick for 3 days."
Ranjan P.,"Pleasanton, CA",0,8,,1.0,12/10/2013,"My 10 year old daughter wanted to eat at this place. So on Friday, Dec 6, 2013 my daughter and me, went to this place. It was really crowded, and the girl at the counter told me that it will be a 1 hour wait. I looked at my daughter and she said we will wait. I was given token # 69. The time was about 7:30 PM. Here I am standing waiting for my turn, watching people come and go by taking their tokens and waiting for their turn to come just like me. After some time I had a feeling that people that had shown up after me were being called. I told this to my daughter and she did not care as long as she got to eat here. After about 30 minutes a family came in took the token and stood next me. But 20 minutes later they were called and not us. Now my daughter saw this and asked me to enquire at the counter. We were told that we have to wait another 10 mins for our turn. When I asked how come poeple who came after me are being called, she told me that, this should not happen and has no clue why it is. After another 15 minutes when I again went to the counter I was told that I am the next in the waiting list. My daughter was so happy now eagerly waiting for our turn. A few minutes later we were called. When I went to the counter, another girl whispered in her ear that it is not their turn but the turn of another 2 guys who had shown up at the place about 15 minitures back!  I told them this and all I got as an answer was that I will be next. By now I was at my wits end and asked to speak to their manager. The manager had nothing more to say except that we were next. Instead she wasked me to tell her why I thought that people had been called before their turn. All I told her was to look at her logs and find that out. She had no answer. Long story short, I convinced my daughter to go to ""On the Borders"" at Hacienda Crossings and it turned out to be awesome. Myy daughter being the happiest girl in town after having her dinner and desert. But the memory of how the people at Cheesecake Factory cheated her of her dinner that night even after a 1 hour 15 minute wait still lingers in her mind."
Samantha B.,"Livermore, CA",162,170,,3.0,7/28/2010,"So the first thing I have to say is that this place is SO SLOW!!!!! It takes forever to get seated, get the food, get check, etc.... It really is not worth it overall to spend hours waiting for a meal.  Now the cheesecake itself is very yummy. But take it to go,"
