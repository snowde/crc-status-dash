Rachael W.,"Folsom, CA",13,57,16,4.0,5/11/2010,"Dayum, this place rocks. I had been to the Vegas CCF & liked it...but it was so hot that eating anything in Vegas really was a bit of a chore. Now that we found the one in Pleasanton I am happy to say I seriously enjoyed the food. I got the special of the day...some sort of caper cream sauced pecan crusted catfish. SOOOOO good!! The place is busy as hell, the menu is huge as hell, portions are big as hell,  and the food is good as hell!! Hubby & I enjoyed our lunch on the patio thoroughly."
Joanne B.,"Castro Valley, CA",1,74,1,2.0,9/19/2012,"Took my daughter here for a pre-back to school lunch. This place came HIGHLY recommended. Went during lunchtime which was obviously a mistake. The patrons were talking SO loud, I couldn't hear my daughter. We literally had to yell to each other across the little table. Seemed to be a lot of obnoxious business people. C'mon people, where are your manners! It was like being in an elementary school cafeteria. All we needed was a tray of food being spilled and a food fight, and I'd be in 2nd grade again. Wait staff was pleasant but quite overworked. Because we'd never been here before, we wanted to look at the menu for a few minutes - which turned into a half hour because our waiter was so busy, he couldn't get back to us. Daughter wanted some kind of veggie burger, to which the waiter said, ""I wouldn't recommend it"". Okay - I don't see the point in offering things that aren't recommended. My daughter is a vegetarian and had a difficult time finding an item to begin with. The noise level was so incredibly loud - couple that with having to wait so long to give an order....we decided to leave. Manager came over and tried to make us happy, but I couldn't hear half of what she was saying. After saying four times that we just wanted to leave, we finally had to just get up....and leave. Decor was beautiful, but the atmosphere was destroyed by the noise level. For the prices they charge, I would expect a more demeanor crowd. I don't want to pay $11 for a burger but have more noise than being at an A's game. They need to hire more lunchtime staff. Those folks were stressed to keep up and give people the attention they needed. Highly recommended, but highly overrated. Won't be back anytime soon."
Jai B.,"Pleasanton, CA",1,9,,1.0,8/11/2013,Went here for brunch .. The homely looking short hostess up front with glasses likes to roll her eyes when asked questions she also likes to you gossip about the customers right in front of you which i think is kind of rude. Other than that nice waitress good food..but unfortunately the service we received before being seated overshadowed the good points. this probably won't change anyone's mind about choosing to eat at this place however corporate Cheesecake Factory if you are reading this you need to fire the little hobbit up front with the glasses 8(
Cindy S.,"San Jose, CA",13,107,33,1.0,7/4/2013,"who yelps the cheesecake factory about food?! you just DONT. so apparently i'm yelping about the service i've received. i've been to multiple locations of the cheesecake factory up and down and all around the bay but never had I receive service that was just sooo terrible that I had to yelp about it. Upon arriving, it was 3pm its happy hour but obviously the hostess (sourpuss) did not get the memo at all! After giving us the buzzer we waited about 15 mins. Once our buzzer went off, I approached the hostess to give her my buzzer and she didn't even give me one glance before she snatched the buzzer away from my hands. Talk about rude! Even after that she didn't show us to our table instead it was another hostess. Mood was already RUINED after that little stunt she pulled but I remained calm and brushed it off. After getting our menus, 10 mins go by no one comes to take our orders. Not to mention we werent even given the happy hour menu! I had to flag someone down to take our orders. Usually upon seating, they would bring the bread to the table but this did not happen. Hungry and angry after 30 minutes of waiting (after we ordered), I noticed the table next to us had already received their bread and they were seated after us! Since when did you have to ask for bread? Isn't it always a given?! To make matters worse after I flagged down our waitress to give us some damn bread she gives us BURNT CRUSTY HARD BREAD! WTF?! JUST WTF?! After I flagged down our waitress to bring us some FRESH bread she had the AUDACITY to tell me they were out and that she had to check to see if they were making any more. WOW!!! just wow... whatever i let the bread go because our food finally came. the stupid waitress decided she then wanted to bring us ""fresh bread.""  ********* NOTE TO ESTABLISHMENT: HIRE COMPETENT PEOPLE! ITS SO SIMPLE A MONKEY CAN DO IT!"
Sandyann G.,"Livermore, CA",124,332,677,3.0,8/12/2009,"Normally I avoid those ever popular chain restaurants.  Since it was my daughters birthday we let her pick and she chose Cheesecake Factory.  If you want a great cocktail and have an enormous appetite then this is the place for you.  For all the women out there, be careful at this place, the floor is VERY slick and I advise you to hold the hand of your dinner companion if you are wearing any kind of heels or you might find yourself suddenly polishing the floor. If you have a family of four all you need to do is order one entrée and one dessert.  Everyone will leave fully satisfied and you won't need to remember to get the doggie bag(s) off the table.  I ordered the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp and it was pretty good.  Could have been a little spicier since I asked for 'Spicy' but maybe some people really don't want 'Spicy'.  My husband actually finished his dinner for a change but he had simply ordered the Broiled Salmon.  I mean how much Salmon can they give in one serving? We ordered the White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle cheesecake.  The slice they brought for the birthday girl had her name written in chocolate on the plate.  Very nice touch....but a little too much whipping cream.  Seriously...what did they want us to do with all that? It was a nice place to have a family dinner in and not too expensive.  Be prepared to have enough take home for lunch and dinner the next day."
Camille R.,"Hayward, CA",13,8,3,5.0,4/6/2010,"I went here for my sisters 21st birthday, on a Saturday.  It was my first time being here.  We waited 45 mins which is normal since it was a weekend.  My family and I received awesome customer service from our waitress.  She was very friendly.  I ordered the stuff mushrooms as a appetizer, DELICIOUS! It was mouthwatering.  As my meal, I ordered the shrimp avocado burger, also DELICIOUS!  I would definitely come back. :D"
Ezequiel R.,"San Francisco, CA",174,215,32,4.0,3/11/2012,Usually coming into Cheesecake Factory there is a huge line and minimum of 15 mins wait. Came here for lunch with a friend and we sat right down in the bar area. The server was on point! Recommended some great cocktails and house specials. The food was delicious and plated so well! I am a sucker for presentation and the chefs here always know how to make the food look great. I usually get the lunch portion since it's already unbelievably huge portions. I decided to go with the Chicken Picatta with Angel Hair and mushroom sauce. Delicious! I know I am a foodie at heart but I can appreciate these great restaurants :D
Toni B.,"Hayward, CA",72,42,1,4.0,7/17/2010,"I went there on a Saturday night the wait to get a table was about 30-35 mins not bad, because I have waited longer at other places. The food was good to me I had the chicken mushroom pizza and my husband had a burger. To me it took a little while to get our food but when it came it was hot and fresh. The waiters were all really pleasant and very helpful. I also had the Red velvet cheese cake and its to die for I want to go back just for that. I hope the never take it off the menu because I'm have a love affair with it. My husband had the key-lime and it was tort but not to bad.  Ps the lighting is Very Dim and is very hard to see the menu the could have better lighting."
Annette Y.,"Tracy, CA",130,218,30,3.0,3/30/2010,"Last time I went here my food came out bland and just blah! I sent it back (the first time I've ever done that) and thankfully, they gave me an entire new meal. yay! Still...I don't think this is one of my favorite places for food. But definitely, their bakery is yum yum good. I give em a 5 on the bakery and a 2 for the food.  **MUST TRY THEIR RED VELVET CHEESECAKE** 1500 calories of pure goodness."
David J.,"San Francisco, CA",3,217,6,3.0,9/7/2011,"Food was mixed. Chipotle pasta was mediocre. Salads were pretty decent. Deserts of course were very good. Overly expensive. 2 adults and 2 kids cost us $72 dollars. Nothing is included. Salads are extra, kids menus don't offer complete meals. Deserts even for the kids are extra. It adds up quickly. They lose a star for not offering any paper or crayons (or anything) for kids to do while waiting. Haven't found a kid friendly restaurant that doesn't offer this."
Glenda J.,"Seattle, WA",91,703,3044,1.0,4/23/2012,"Early lunch.  Wasabi crusted ahi tuna.  Couldn't really taste the wasabi.  Pretty bland.  Mango keylime cheesecake was so-so.  Couldn't taste the lime, couldn't taste the mango.  And no, my tastebuds were still very much functioning on that day.  Enjoyed the bread the most.  LOL.  Sorry but that's the truth."
Wandah P.,"Walnut Creek, CA",36,12,,1.0,5/2/2015,"On Monday evening I called in an order to Cheesecake Factory in Pleasanton, Ca.  The order was simple.  They told me it would be 25 mins.  I know it's gets pretty there so I gave them an extra few minutes.  I pull up to curb side and call the number on the sign and after several tries  (10 mins), finally someone answers as I'm now walking thru the door and literally standing in their faces.  To my surprise they aren't busy at all.  Not many folks in the restaurant and not a single person at the bakery.  My food all bagged and ready to go.  Immediately I asked for the manager.  I asked her, ""what's the purpose of curbside service if they aren't willing to answer the phone and come inside anyway?""  She replied, ""I don't know"" and gave me a blank stare.  That was it.  I paid for my meal and walked away.  Needless to say my food was cold and rather old looking.  My lettuce was brown in places, cucumber smelled sour and chicken dry.  I'm impressed enough to go to any other Cheesecake Factory except Pleasanton/Stoneridge Mall."
jack d.,"San Francisco, CA",5000,339,,4.0,1/7/2011,"Went there with the wife around Christmas time so it wes very busy. My first time to the Cheesecake Factory so I had no idea what to expect The wait was about 20 minutes which is not bad considering the crowd. The service was very good. We first ordered the crabcake appitizer (Do not order the crab cake appitizer) They were tasty but only 4 little crabcakes and the price was about $13.00 (way to much) I ordered a flat iron steak which came with mashed potatoes and vegtables. The steak came with a nice steak butter on top and was very good. The wife order the salmon which she was pleasantly pleased with and it was quite a nice size piece of salmon. All in all, we were satisfied with the service, the food and the price. DID not burn a hole in my wallet. Did not have desert because I was way to full but I am confident they must serve up some great cheesecake too,."
Betty Z.,"Pleasanton, CA",1,7,,4.0,1/6/2013,"the food seems to be a hit or miss, but the 4 stars is mainly because of the GREAT servers. they're always friendly, and energetic (: in my experience, the servers always refilled my water without me asking.  i got a mushroom burger on my birthday, because i had one before and it was great. however, the sauce was sweetish and kind of distasteful actually and there were fewer mushrooms that were more sloppy, so i was pretty disappointed about the distracting, sweet sauce. the french fries are really yummy and perfect. the drinks are really overpriced, so i've never bother to try any. but all in all, it's a good restaurant."
Chuck N.,"San Francisco, CA",2281,1151,507,4.0,2/4/2010,"I believe they train their staff to use the word ""absolutely"" every 5 minutes. Service is great here. Real nice staff that is prompt and attentive. Everyone's been to Cheesecake, you can never really go wrong. I had a Del Ray Margarita which was very weak - 1 star for the lack of tequila. Calamari  - delish but a tiny dish Potstickers off the bar menu (happy hour) - 3 perfectly seared potstickers yum (wish they gave more though). Burger sliders - nothing special at all, plain burgers cut into small portions with medium sized fries I prefer their main menu over the bar menu."
Rheine T.,"San Lorenzo, CA",501,136,138,4.0,7/20/2011,"Cheesecake Factory still holds its name.  My boyfriend and I dated here for our first year anniversary, and well it was crowded.  We had to choose either PF Chang's or Cheesecake, and well we aint eating no chinese food on our first year anniversary, so we went Cheesecake.  We didn't order much, our experience was great.  They served us pizza and fettucini alfredo.  I love how you can ask for more cheese, and the servers are really nice, they also suggests items in your liking.  I'd have to say, i will come back for more!"
Rebecca H.,"Dublin, CA",345,2142,212,3.0,7/6/2009,"I've had some decent meals here, and some really bad meals here.  I've had some great service and really disinterested service.  It's the usual mall restaurant.  We took friends from England, they were aghast at the portion sizes.  The new nutritional info is useful, but people may not realize it's per serving, not per dish, and who knows how many servings are in each dish.  The place is loud and noisy, and the decor is confused.  Overall it's not a great restaurant, but decent and not really expensive for eating out with friends.  Whatever you get, ask yourself if you will want to eat it the next day, because you will take home leftovers."
Nava N.,"San Francisco, CA",15,301,28,3.0,3/1/2012,"This Cheesecake Factory always has a crazy long wait, however by the time I eat it is one of the few places still open in the area. I love there Skinny Menu and the red velvet cheesecake is amazingly delicious :)"
Amy J.,"East Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",527,1758,161,3.0,11/12/2006,"Long wait, check. Outdoor seating, check. Good food, check.  Service is normally pretty quick here, but since I went on opening night with about four other people, it seemed a little slow.  I'll give them the benefit of the doubt because it was opening night and everyone's still getting acclimated.  The servers were very nice though and very attentive.  The size of this place is quite large...I was surprised.  My pasta was piping hot when I arrived which made me very happy because we did wait for awhile...good thing I was in the company of my friends or I would've walked out.  it's a shame my appetite was pretty much gone after the wait.  We had samples of pumpkin cheesecake...hooray for opening night.  Very hard to have a conversation because there are so noisy, the sounds tend to have a hard time traveling."
BabyTree L.,"Kirkland, WA",1,7,,4.0,7/2/2014,Amazing restaurant.  One of my long time favorites...  Price is very reasonable.  They also have wonderful dark oat bread.  They taste soooo good with butter.
