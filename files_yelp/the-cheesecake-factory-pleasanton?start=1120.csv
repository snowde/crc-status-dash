Nicolle M.,"Oakland, CA",48,55,,4.0,11/17/2009,"Oh my bejeeezuussss they are now serving the nutritional guide along side their menus! Is this really necessary!??!  We all know the Cheesecake doesn't serve the most ""nutritional"" food but that's not why we go there, hello large portion sizes and variety! I DO NOT want to know that one slice of carrot cake has over 1500 calories, no I'd rather be in denial and think carrots = vegetables = good for me!  You'll most likely wait at peak eating times and being next to the mall makes this more than likely. Lunch is a good deal though as they have many of their favorite dishes (my favorite is the chicken romano) for a smaller portion and smaller price, but still big enough to share. My past lunch visit was cheaper than a visit for 2 at Nordstrom's Cafe.  The menu is huge but variety is the spice of life as they so say!"
Carol H.,"Bay Area, CA",143,87,,4.0,2/13/2012,"I have been here over a dozen times and we always seem to get seated in the same area, makes us feel like its our private spot.  The wait is mad crazy and you can not call ahead to pre-hold a spot. This is our default eating place when at the mall.  Once inside you would not know it was attached to it.  The food has always been good to us as far as appetizers, small plates, and the children's meals.  The cheesecakes are always fabulous."
Jenna P.,"San Ramon, CA",72,33,4,4.0,6/27/2011,"I've been to the cheesecake factory many many times, and I usually enjoy it! My only thing is that when I was just here last Friday for lunch, the place was really empty. No complaint there. :) We were sat in the bar area at a table squished right inbetween two other tables. I couldn't figure out why, if the whole restaurant was open, why they would smash us in like cattle. I guess it wouldn't have been so bad if the table of girls weren't talking so loud and obnoxious with one woman coughing all over the place. Guess that's more of the patron's complaint than the restaurant. Either way, the servers are awesome, there are a few that are a bit rude, but I think anywhere you go you'll have that.   The food was delicious. Super large portions. and the cheesecake... bomb. :)"
Yarden B.,"New York, NY",25,18,,1.0,6/9/2011,"Horrible!! After consuming two tuna dishes on Monday, six hours later I've became violently ill. They should remove these items  from the menu until the staff is properly trained on how to handle raw food!! My recommendation is to avoid this location at all costs! Apparently many other consumers have had similar problems/experiences with this particular chain..."
Tisha G.,"London, United Kingdom",674,443,247,4.0,4/24/2009,"Generally, I liked it here! It took a while to get us seated, even for a Wednesday night (Good half hour at least), Even the bar was jam packed with people munching down on goodies, so there was no way to get a drink while we waited. When we were were finally seated, everyone ordered their alcoholic beverage of choice. Lemon drop, pina colada, stella beer, and for me - House Merlot by Robert Mondavi. Fabulous! Only down side was that their serving of wine was TINY - Even Olive Garden fills up my glass. Anyways, our waitress was awesome. I didn't catch her name though - OH WELL! She was kind of hyper but I like that cus I'm pretty eccentric myself. We ordered cripsy artichoke hearts, stuffed mushrooms and shrimp scampi crostini. And there was plenty of bread to go around! YUM. Then came the salads for those who ordered a side salad. SIDE SALAD?! Those things were gigantic. My friends couldn't finish them. Then came our entrees. I ordered the Seared Tuna Tataki Salad which was a little on sour side, but it was still wonderful! Fish was just right, and greens were so delicious with that wasabi vinaigrette (4 stars out of 5). Boyfriend ordered the Chicken Parmesan Sandwich which I had the pleasure of tasting. If anything was a YUM-O moment, THIS was a definite YUM-O Rachel Ray moment! Lots of yummy marinara sauce inside this huge sandwich with a great slab of Chicken Parmesan, and served with a side of marinara and fries. My other friends ordered the following: White Pizza, Four Cheese Pasta, and Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp. White Pizza - Pretty good! It's like the one from CPK, but i liked the crust better. Good to slather in ranch! HAHA Four Cheese Pasta - Hearty portion, couldn't finish it, and it was pretty tasty. Good for a classic! Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp - Great for a Thai Food lover! My friend ordered it without the coconut flakes, but it came with it. They sent it back to the kitchen, and even took it off the menu. Great Service! Dessert - Lemon and Raspberry Cheesecake, Oreo Cookie Cheesecake, White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle Cheesecake, Blueberry Cheesecake, Dulce de Leche Cheesecake My favorite was the Oreo Cookie Cheesecake that I ordered because it's always wonderful. But the Lemon Raspberry was INCREDIBLE! The rest were a little too sweet for my taste. I personally need sweets with a little TART to even it out! Overall, great service. Still wish that they hadn't skimped on the wine portions. The second serving was even smaller than the first! Therefore, although service was impeccable, the number of rated stars I gave was 4. Total bill was 180. We gave a 25 dollar tip because the waitress was pretty awesome. But try changing those wine portions and making them bigger Cheesecake Factory, it's a good business practice!"
Kelsey G.,"Hayward, CA",0,12,,4.0,6/21/2014,"The cheesecake Factory is always good! I went to this location on my birthday last month, and although the food and service were great, I was disappointed that they made me pay for my birthday dessert..."
Angela K.,"San Lorenzo, CA",295,673,1071,3.0,1/29/2010,"I only come here when I'm in the area and before I leave Pleasanton I would come here and order a couple of slices of cheesecake to go.  I haven't ate the lunch or dinner here and not planning to because I heard from my fellow friends that the food isn't great here.  The cheesecakes that I would order are:  Fresh Banana Cream  White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle  Fresh Strawberry  Oh and the parking here really sucks because of the mall!!  =( Overall, I get great service at the Bakery and that's why I always come back!!"
C B.,"Newark, CA",28,56,32,2.0,9/2/2013,"wait is terrible here. good ambience, but it's all in the name. not impressed with their seafood and fish entrees, it's not as good as it used to be.. only the desserts are good here. it's pricier than ever. not a big fan anymore."
Nicholas H.,"Troutdale, OR",3,22,,5.0,6/11/2011,"We've always had great experiences with the Cheesecake Factory - and this latest one was no exception.  Our first visit was a reservation we'd made in advance - and then I got laid off that very day.  We debated whether or not to go, and finally decided to relax and enjoy the evening, and I am so glad we did!  The staff went out of their way to fix any little thing wrong.  When they served us the wrong steak, not only did the waiter apologize and start correcting the problem, but the manager swung by as well to apologize - something we didn't ask for or expect!  Very service-oriented. Our most recent visit was our 4th or 5th, and this last one was just amazing.  Yes, there is a wait every time you go  - it's a very popular restaurant!  Call earlier in the day to set up a reservation for that evening, and you won't have to wait 45+ minutes.  Even so, the wait is worth it.  While we were waiting, my wife asked for some bread since she gets dizzy when she's extremely hungry, and the lead hostess brought it to us on a platter with water cups - a waitress before we even sat down!  How awesome is that?  The same hostess asked if it was a special occasion since we were dressed up, and when she learned it was our anniversary, it was as if the whole staff suddenly learned the same thing.  Our escort to the table and our waitress both wished us a happy anniversary, and when she brought out our (FANTASTIC) Dulce de Leche Cheesecake, they had written ""Happy Anniversary"" in chocolate around the edge of the plate.  Even during a very busy Friday night, our waitress found time to stop by - not too often, not too little - and see how we were doing. The entire staff treated us like royalty, and I can't think of a time where I felt rushed to leave, even when they were busy.  Every time I go here, I get to eat a delicious meal with large portions at the same price I would find at, say, an Olive Garden.  I love coming here and I look forward to returning!"
Mrs. M.,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",27,155,18,4.0,10/31/2009,"Let's just get the bad out of the way first: the cheesecake is good (I said good, not great), until you get a bite that screams ""I WAS FROZEN AND HAVE THAT FROZEN CARDBOARD TASTE"". You know what I'm talking about... Let's be real.. be honest -- the selection of cheesecake flavors is what's awesome, not the actual cheesecake. The whipped cream.. I can't tell if it's aerosol or fresh.. it has no flavor and leaves a coating of Crisco in your mouth.  OK, on to the good:  -The menu selection. There is something for everyone! The menu is really too big. Page after page after page.. SO much to choose from.  -The service. Our server checked in with us often without being a pain. Our waters were never below the half mark. Everything was timed well. Our dirty dishes were cleared (bonus points here!) when we were done eating.  -The food. Really good! Served piping hot with fresh ingredients that blended well together for some good grubbin'. We came home with a lot of leftovers because the portions are very, very generous.  -The atmosphere. While I'm not a fan of sitting so close to other tables, I do like the way the place is designed as far as the great colors, great lighting, very appealing look that is historical looking, yet trendy. I don't like hearing everything that's happening at the next table yet we always forget to request a booth.  Go here for the cool atmosphere, huge menu, delicious food, big portions, and great service. Skip the cheesecake.. really, it's frozen and not so great. Don't let the extensive flavor list lure you in. $6.50-$7.50 for a piece of thawed frozen cheesecake that has a hint of frozen cardboard flavor just doesn't cut it."
Rea B.,"Pleasanton, CA",0,3,,2.0,9/22/2013,"The food was okay, but we waited for more than 2 hours to get seated. They kept adding 15 more minutes to our wait. We were hungry and upset. It wasn't worth the wait."
MT D.,"San Francisco, CA",124,178,2,4.0,5/13/2009,"This is my favorite Cheesecake Factory location because I never had to wait. I used to work right across from Stoneridge Mall, so we usually get here just before 12 to beat the lunch line. In the spring or summer or fall, when Pleasanton warms us, outside seating is usually quite pleasant. This Cheesecake's food and service is like any other locations. I can never get tired of their Garlic Shrimpl Noodle and Chipotle Pasta. They are  HIGHLY recommended. I'd get lunch portion to save your buck, and I usually togo my portion anyways. It's way too much carb for me to take."
Deana L.,"Riverbank, CA",1,17,,1.0,3/25/2015,"I took my mother and 2 daughters here for dinner last night after shopping at the mall. Never again. We have had great experiences at other Cheesecake factories and we were excited to eat here. After a short wait we were seated. Sat there for 20 min before being acknowledged by our server who very rudely took our drink order. 20 minutes later she came back and proceeded to tell me I had to help her pass out the drinks. Ok, I unloaded her tray and passed them around. Odd but whatever. 40 min later she showed up again to take our order. Nearly an hour later our food was served by someone else. It was ok, not great but we were starving. I had to search the restaurant for silverware, she was no where to be found. Never a drink refill, nothing. After eating and waiting around another 20 min I hunted down a menu and found her around the corner. I told her we needed to order cheesecake. 10 min later she took our order and again proceeded to tell me I needed to help her clear off the table to make room for our cheesecake because she ""couldn't do it all"" So I stacked all the dishes, napkins and silverware (while she stood and watched) and handed them to her. Never a thank you or a smile even though I'm doing all her work! Someone else brought our cheesecake and ignored me when I was trying to ask for silverware. Had to go track forks down again. I get that you guys get busy but come on! 3 hours and a hefty bill later we were finally out of there and were just shaking our heads in disbelief over the ridiculous ""service"" we received."
Florence W.,"Fremont, CA",122,281,27,3.0,2/23/2009,"Your standard chain restaurant--except three things kind of disturbed me when I went this past weekend.  1) Our server gave us our basket of sourdough and told us the wheat bread would be coming out soon. I never saw the bread--sad face. My friend and I love their wheat bread! This was only a minor thing and I didn't take off any stars for that; it was an honest mistake.  2) I ordered the Chicken Bellagio which came in huge portions. two big pieces of crispy chicken breasts over spaghetti and Parmesan cream sauce.  It was quite delicious! The pasta was really dry, so I suggest you ask for extra sauce on the side. The biggest thing that bothered me was the fact that the spaghetti was green. Now I happen to love spinach pasta so I took this as a pleasant surprise. However. as I was eating my pasta, I noticed the green color was coming off into the sauce and on the chicken until the spaghetti was completely stripped of color. I felt kind of gross. I wouldn't have minded regular spaghetti, really.  3) My friend ordered the tomato basil pasta. This has chicken tossed with basil, tomatoes, mozzarella and penne pasta. It was really light and flavorful, but my friend complained that she only had two small pieces of fresh moz.  Like I said, most of these things were minor, but that whole fake green spaghetti kind of got to me. I was going to give them 4 stars, but took off 1 star for their fakery. Total for bill including tax and tip: 31 smackeroos.  Final Verdict: Of all the chain restaurants, this is one of my faves, I never rant about them, I always give raves. However, the green pasta made me want to cringe, I didn't finish the pasta and headed to BJ's to binge."
Jose R.,"Hayward, CA",154,15,,1.0,3/23/2011,The mac-n-cheese balls were awesome ... The waiter was trying his best... THE CHEFS ARE ILLITERATE!! plain and simple. That's where your stars went. L2read an order.....
Jaime P.,"Danville, CA",222,820,6,2.0,6/25/2009,"I was hungry... and miserable after my Dr.'s appointment so off to CF my boyfriend and I went. I was really craving fish so I hoped they had my Meditteranean Mahi Mahi that I've grown to love in the past year. While service was fairly prompt, the food itself was meh.  My fish came out overcooked and swimming in grease.  The mashed potatoes were undercooked.   *sigh* but as I said I was really hungry, so I ate it anyways.  I really hope this was just an off day for them, but yeah I probably won't order that dish again!"
Jake L.,"Oakland, CA",0,40,5,2.0,5/26/2012,I came here for lunch and had the Kobe burger. I asked for medium rare and I got just short of well-done. The sauce was good but the meat was ruined. Pretty disappointing for a $14 burger.
Nick M.,"Dublin, CA",23,17,24,3.0,11/27/2012,"I had the Chicken Carbonara with fried chicken instead of grilled. It was great. Came quick and nice and hot. My brother on the other hand his food did not show up for 10 min after mine. Then when it did show up his order was wrong. Finally the waitress was a little snipitey with us. But I blame this on her frustration with the cook. So I gave it 3 stars, considering the mgr was helpful to resolve the situation. And comp my brothers meal, I will return to cheese cake. To hopefully update this review, with a more positive out come."
Carlson T.,"Fremont, CA",172,107,138,2.0,6/20/2011,"This place was packed when I went. Waited over an hour just to get seated and it was loud as hell. I ordered the steak Diane/ chicken Madeira and it came out super sweet and salty. Additionally, the service was slow, but I couldn't blame them. I'm probably not going to come back for awhile."
C P.,"Sacramento, CA",6,94,,3.0,11/10/2009,"Had a friend in town visiting so we decided to splurge on Cheesecake Factory. I rarely go here because of the cost. I can't get away from the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp which was tasty as always and the portion is large. I brought half of it home. I love the decor and the wait staff was great for our relaxing and extended lunch. They were accommodating and told us take our time....and we did.  I just have a hard time with the prices......I had my entree and soda...with tax and tip, no appetizer, no dessert and it was $25. They do have less expensive options, but just didn't sound as tasty to me.  Will reserve CF for more special occasions."
