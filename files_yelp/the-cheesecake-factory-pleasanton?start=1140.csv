Kim C.,"Hayward, CA",1,10,,4.0,11/22/2012,The service was top notch. wait time was reasonable. food was fantastic
Mark P.,"San Ramon, CA",3,13,,3.0,5/20/2014,"Have eaten here twice.  The menu is daunting.  It is really hard to make a choice.  Many varieties to choose from.  First time I had a Cuban Sandwich.  It was very good.  But it was at lunch time and my wife and I had to take a small table between two other tables and there was no privacy at all.  It was also so loud we could hardly talk.  The next time we went it was about 4 pm.  To late for lunch and early for dinner.  It was much better.  I had a spicy shrimp dish.  Once again it was good.  My only issue with the food is that they try to cover so many types of food.  The make them good, but they lack a real sense of authenticity.  In the Bay area, we can have the real deal in whatever type of food we want.  But if you want a safe bet for a group with varying tastes, this would be your place."
Will I A m.,"San Francisco, CA",3,470,1,4.0,12/21/2009,"This place is GOOOOOD!!! granted i have not tried everything on their menu and cheesecake menu but the stuff i've tried makes me tolerate their 30-45 min lines! appetizer: avocado roll, very good, especially the dip entree: the bomb a$$ luau salad and their pastas.  huge portions for good price cheesecakes:  let's get down to business. here are the favs...banana cream, carrot cake, kalua coffee.  very good!!! warning though.....had breakfast on a saturday.  the menu is very limited, mostly omelettes.  the omelettes were bad.  the egg appeared to be from a carton.  the omelette looked like a yellow piece of foam.  we had a table of 5 breakfasts....no raves from anyone.  stick with the non-breakfast menu."
Janice B.,"San Ramon, CA",0,11,,1.0,5/17/2015,"Wow ( and thats not in a positive way). Went to the cheescake factory at 3:30pm today, got seated at 3:50. Waiter comes up and says, hi my name is.... I'm going to take your order, I'm getting off now but someone else will serve you. 30 minutes later my moms 1/2 sandwich with a side salad comes, but without her soup. Asked twice for the soup got it when we got the check!!!  I ordered a burrito, 10 minutes after my mom got her dish, I asked where my meal was. 10 minutes later I got chicken enchiladas. I state, I didn't order that. And if I was stupid, the waiter trys to tell me thats a burrito...ERRRRRR!!! No its not, bring it back and bring me a burrito, so lets read the menu together so you get this right.... So we do. 10 minutes later the same enchiladas come out, but now its smashed flat in the dish. Asked for the manager who trys to tell me the same thing. I said, ""Do you know what a Burrito looks like""??? The topper to all this is when we first put in our order we ordered a meal to go, at the end, I asked the waitress for our meal to go, and she states, "" Oh the waiter never wrote it down, what did you order""?? Are you fricken kidding me??? Needless to say a phone call to corporate will be made in the a.m. and that menu item will be changed to read according to what you will see on your dish. I told the manager why even bother giving the customer a menu if your going to fix the meals like you want them and not what is written on the menu!!!!"
Chia C.,"Oakland, CA",70,186,18,2.0,1/28/2009,"It's good to see that everyone for the most part is having the same bad experience at ""The Factory"" as I am. Don't get me wrong...the food is good -  Ahi Roll Appitzer? Will you marry me? Sushi roll or not, I'm in love - but the service is not great...and it's not even the wait staff. The wait staff is ON IT, but the kitchen sucks. If Chef Ramsey from Hell's Kitchen were near by they would TOTALLY get ripped a nice, big, new asshole.  Today I went with my team from work - party of 8, a big party but big groups are what The Factory does...have you see the size of their boothes? They're ginormous! But somehow they managed to forget one person's meal, after it was repeated back to us and confirmed. So all of us have our food, but aren't eating while we wait for the one dish...when it finally is brough 10 mins later, it is THE WRONG DISH. Now, that is after the waitress and manager came over and apologized, checked on us multiple times, confirmed the order and verified that the kitchen simply FORGOT the dish initially. Needless to say, it was sent back and 15 mins later the proper dish was brought.  Now - of course the meal was comped, but my thing is...the rest of us had to wait too...I'm not saying comp our meals, because we DID eat, but a measley 10% on the entire bill would have gone a long way, or a giftcard for a slice of cheesecake? Oh! That would have been a generous ""I'm sorry"" and they would have had repeat business - guaranteed. Instead, they are up (at least) 1 review on yelp and down 8 customers, as none of us want to go back. Shame Cheesecake! Shame."
Stephen W.,"Livermore, CA",51,17,1,4.0,9/8/2011,This place is great. Everytime I leave this place I want to lapse into a food coma..well done cheesecake factory. The staff is friendly ( go figure I never expect them to be hostel or ready to beat me unmercifully ) The free bread is always a plus. Again well done...( please rename yourself to the cheesecake palace..because that's what you look like...your giving people who aspire to work in a factorys false hopes)
MK D.,"Burlingame, CA",59,1986,1591,4.0,10/12/2011,Went here for Sunday brunch and dined outside. It was a gorgeous day and got a lil' tanned while sipping on a pineapple mojito. I had the vietnamese tacos for appetizers. I skipped dessert but definitely would love to come back.
Alysia W.,"East Bay, CA",3297,592,72,2.0,1/28/2009,"Huge portions, high prices, mediocre taste. AND you have to wait an extremely long time to be sat.. I'm not a fan of this place whatsoever and would only return if you dragged me there.. (by the teeth!!)"
Kailey M.,"Livermore, CA",17,37,5,3.0,1/6/2012,"I have been going to this Cheesecake Factory for quite a while and have a few select items on the menu that are my favorites, especially the avocado egg rolls. YUM!  I have a life threatening food allergy, so it's imperative for me to be careful with what I select, so I always order one of the same things I've ordered before. I normally NEVER have a problem when I come here as the waiters and waitresses are always accommodating and understanding when I tell them about my allergy. I don't expect any special treatment or exceptions, I just need to be careful about what I order.  Although I always order ""safe"" items off the menu, my last visit to the Cheesecake Factory ended with me in the emergency room. I don't blame the restaurant as I understand that things happen and that's the risk that I take by eating out. However, when I went back to explain to the manager what had happened and asked for some insight on how to prevent it from happening again, he blew me off and was completely rude. He didn't offer any sort of apology and consistently tried to cover his ass as if I was accusing them of doing something wrong. Clearly someone screwed up somewhere otherwise I wouldn't have ended up in the hospital. But I wasn't trying to place blame, I was trying to find out what had happened and how to prevent it in the future. He was a total and complete jerk. I think the service is great and the hosts and servers here do a great job of handling a lot of customers when they're busy, but the manager should be fired. It wouldn't, however, prevent me from coming here again."
Jeff P.,"Dublin, CA",10,254,12,4.0,3/8/2009,"Yeah I know this place is really over priced and an annoying chain restaurant but what can I say, I love this place.  Their cashew chicken and avocado egg rolls are the shit. And their orange chicken is pretty good to. Their portions are pretty large and their service isn't that bad either. I am not a big cheesecake fan but they are pretty good. Its retarded busy on the weekends so be careful."
Erika G.,"Oakland, CA",0,39,11,1.0,3/28/2015,"Terrible customer service! Was in one afternoon, the restaurant was slow, the female manager was serving the tables. I ordered the chicken Madeira, which forever to come out. Take into consideration there r few customers. A waiter brought it out, as soon as he placed it on the table I noticed MY DISH HAD A HAIR ON IT!! I instantly told him, and he had the nerve to ask, do you still want it? Umm no!! What kind of a question is that. The manager comes out, apologizes and says they are making a new plate. Well I get tired of waiting on the new plate so I tell her I will take it to go as I was full from my appetizers. Once I get home that I'm going to eat my dish I realize the CHICKEN IS UNDERCOOKED. It was pinkish and gooey and wet looking. I immediately called and asked to speak to the manager. The previous manager is no longer there, a gentleman who I believe is named Geoffrey /Gregory? speaks to me. He was very rude, kept cutting me off while I tried to explain my whole negative experience at the restaurant.. Once I told him about the raw chicken he tried contradicting me. Said even tho the chicken is pink, doesn't mean the chicken is raw.. I know what raw chicken looks like... If the restaurant is short staffed, that is one issue, but giving customers raw food is a health concern (salmonella). The manager seemed arrogant and non apologetic just said would speak to the kitchen.. I will not be going back again even tho the chicken Madeira is my favorite dish #thumbsdown #poorcustomerservice"
Avery B.,"San Francisco, CA",2,40,,5.0,6/12/2012,"Just went to the Pleasanton, CA location on Saturday night.  Had a great experience.  Our waitress was very nice and anything we asked for came to the table promptly.  A couple of the other wait staff helped out and served us promptly too.  Food is always good at the Cheesecake Factory and it was on Saturday as well."
Elena B.,"San Leandro, CA",2,63,6,2.0,4/2/2012,"So I must say I would have given these place a 4 at least but the service no matter what location I go to SUCKS!!!!...we get there and we have 5 adults and 2 kids, wait time 50 min. ok fine we'll shop at the mall, arrive back around 30 min, they say yes 20 more min. after about 25 we are finally called.  Host walks us to the seat by the way does not seem happy with her job, waitress however is nice.  so we place our order, drinks and bread served.  However after a long wait for just sandwiches, our order was not right, I asked to add cheese to my sandwich, low and behold NO cheese, my brother asked to add brocolli to his fettucini and not there either, we then ask for the brocolli they say sorry not on the bill, we can now charge you for that? OK fine...all in all service SUCKED but after food was done right it was good!"
Nacine B.,"Lathrop, CA",8,101,51,5.0,10/22/2013,"We ate here for lunch before lining up at the apple store to get the iphone 5s.( we made sure we had sure we had a full stomach since the line was long :D). Anyway, the line here was long as well. But it's worth the wait."
Tomekia G.,"San Ramon, CA",1,42,9,1.0,12/19/2013,Stay away from Emma with the glasses!  Terrible!!! She made everything about the CF a bad experience.  I think she needs a new occupation....
jenny t.,"San Ramon, CA",32,102,171,2.0,5/9/2011,"I would've given this restaurant 4-5 stars from our multiple prior visits because of the food, service and ambiance... but during our last visit in early April, our waitress Patrice(?) ruined our experience because she accused her customer, us, of arguing with her when we were very calmly questioning about the pricing of our bill as it doesn't match the menu price.  About one minute into our inquiry with her, she no longer wanted to listen to us (that how we felt) and had offered for us to talk to her manager.  I hateded when she said ""I apologize"" when her body language and tone of voice were not sincere.  I would've gotten the manager's attention if I didn't have an out-of-town guest with me; I didn't want the waitress to once again ruin our day. 4/5 stars for food 4/5 stars for service (not including the waitress I mentioned above) 4/5 stars for everything else P.S.  Out of country guests visited us at the end of April and I so dearly wanted to take them out for ""American food"".  I couldn't get over the last experience so we went to a popular steakhouse, which had steady food and service, in Dublin instead and all thumbs up for them!"
Samantha E.,"Pleasanton, CA",29,65,11,5.0,12/18/2011,"The Variety of food is great and any cheesecake factory is great the servers are great!!!! Calamari is amazing along with salads, pastas, and burgers"
Michael R.,"Encino, CA",34,27,,1.0,5/20/2009,"Food poisoning from the creamy chicken picatta...stay away!!   I also have a friend that ordered a chicken dish about 3 months after I got sick, and she got food poisoning as well!! eek!"
Jenny B.,"San Ramon, CA",15,6,,4.0,4/26/2014,The food is always consistent and the service is great. The Chicken Madeira is to die for!
The H.,"Livermore, CA",2,65,3,2.0,12/22/2008,"I heard nothing but good things about this place. I heard you must eat here, no matter how long the wait. I've been lied to.  This place is not my cup of tea. First, it is huge inside.  Bigger is usually not better when it comes to restaurants.  Second, there are employees everywhere. There are tables as far as the eye can see. The hot plate, where the servers get the food, is 400 yards long. It is a monstrosity built to hold the hoards of people who can't enough of this superb food. So, we order...  I order ice tea and the waitress says that they don't have regular ice tea it is some kind of berry-fruit ice tea. ""No plain ice tea?"" I ask. She responds ""No"". Hmmm...should I ask for plain hot tea and a cup of ice? Well, I don't want our waitress' head to explode so I settle for water. I ordered the shrimp BLT. Three pieces of bread filled with a side salad, 1 cup of dressing, 2 thin pieces of soggy bacon and 6 small shrimp. I took a bite, tasted lettuce and dressing and sent it back. They wanted to replica it right away, but I didn't want to read their War and Peace sized menu again, so I tried my wife's food. She had a grilled chicken dish, with sauce and a side of veggies. It tasted just like I described it...grilled chicken with sauce and side of veggies. Not much to report. Our light lunch of one chicken dish, one glass of wine, one water and one returned sandwich...$23.85.  The place is all hype and not much else. It is a really big place with a huge menu. It has something for everyone and that must be why so many people like it. The prices are high, the food is lousy and, well, I just don't like anything about it. I don't think I should be reviewing a place like this because I hate places like this. They really are all the same. I would have given the place one star, but my wife likes it, so they can have two stars."
