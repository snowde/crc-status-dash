Sharon V.,"Oakland, CA",202,47,12,3.0,12/5/2008,"Two different experiences: one bad, one good gives this place three stars Me and 24 other friends came here on a Saturday night when they DO NOT TAKE RESERVATIONS. So, we waited for about 1 1/2 hours for a seating area. FInally, the manager said that if we'd like to be seated immediately, he could seat us outside and we gladly took the offer. Service was wonderful! The waiter was patient--he split the bill, made substitutions, and took his time. We had about five different people waiting on us which was great. Bad experience? I went another time with a couple friends and asked to substitute fish for meat. After telling me it would be an even substitute, she slapped on an extra $8 to my bill. Long story short, she gave me a ton of attitude about it. Yuck. Great for large parties, but way too loud for a romantic dinner."
Aliya C.,"Tracy, CA",2,55,10,3.0,5/20/2012,"Service was great but the wait to get a table is insanely terrible. We had to wait for almost 3.5 hours. For real, this place is crazy busy."
D H.,"Dublin, CA",5,24,3,2.0,4/19/2014,"Sad to say this location has taken a turn for the worse.  The service was below average and the food was average for a Cheesecake location.  They took my name for the wait list, no problem. When I inquired how much longer I had to wait, the host couldn't locate me by the pager they gave me. He needed help to locate my check in. When they buzzed us, we immediately checked in. Well several other people were seated before us, until we had to remind them we were waiting as well. When we asked if we could have a booth rather than a table in the bar area, the host replied ""I'll have to ask my co-worker."" Really? We were eventually seated in a booth. My menu was covered in butter! Between our seating and meal, we dealt with three different servers. We had to ask for bread and drink refills. The shrimp in my gumbo still had the shell on. On a trip to the bathroom, I discovered nobody cleans the restroom anymore. It was sad. We quickly paid and left. This was our last Cheesecake visit!"
Alex M.,"Concord, CA",5,57,54,3.0,12/26/2011,"Delicious chain resteraunt.  The food is a bit prices, which is understandable because the portions are huge! Everyone I went with enjoyed their meal.  I definately recommend the buffalo blasts as an appetizer..amazing.  (he biggest down fall is the wait for a table, apparently not even a reservation will help you out here."
Kim C.,"Fremont, CA",75,27,10,4.0,6/29/2011,"Never been stung at this place. Although pricey the meals are always big enough to share, plus that leaves you with room for CHEESECAKE! Make sure you put your name on the list prior to shopping. The wait time is the worst!"
Lisa B.,"Costa Mesa, CA",35,58,5,3.0,8/14/2009,I've always had a decent meal here. I love their Barbque Chicken Ranch Salad...it's always good. And their bread is awesome too...I usually sit at the bar and the service is good and the bartenders are friendly.  Can't complain.
Amy N.,"San Francisco, CA",26,287,64,4.0,1/14/2009,"My first time eating at any Cheesecake Factory and my expectations were low. I'd heard great portions and cheesecake, but also overrated. My brother's eaten here many times and had lots of recommendations. I decided to try something he hadn't had, the Cajun Chicken Littles. I have never seen so many pieces of chicken on a plate for one person before. And mashed potatoes. And succotash. Enough for two more meals. Creamy mashed potatoes and fresh tasting succotash, but I prefer it without bell peppers. Chicken was moist, but batter had no flavor, hence two delicious dipping sauces. Really fried up calamari was good, so was the complimentary bread. My dad's Bang Bang Chicken had shredded coconut on top of the curry chicken sauce and was yummy. Lots of food variety period, including the salads. Now the important part... There are two pages devoted to desserts. I repeat: TWO PAGES OF DESSERTS! Kahlua cheesecake recommended for those who like strong coffee flavor. I chose the lemon raspberry, and although I couldn't finish I soaked up all that raspberry coulis. Probably one of their lighter desserts and I would get it again. Service was on point, but even at 5:30 there's a long wait to get seated. Bring a group that likes variety and leftovers."
J a.,"Castro Valley, CA",1,12,,3.0,2/22/2011,Eggs benedict was great...bread good...place reminds me of vegas with high arch architecture...not good enough for 30 min wait...lots of hot chicks
Zulu Q.,"Mountain View, CA",733,870,21,3.0,9/7/2008,"Because the suburban soccer moms in mom jeans need a night on the town too. I mean, it is what it is. However, the wait for a Saturday was better than it could be, service was pretty good, food is what is expected, cheesecake is good. Ok, I know that you're all going to read the next part and shake your heads and think to yourself, ""Geez, when you have kids you will understand."" Aight, there may be a time when a Mr. Urban Socialite will be THE Mr. Urban Socialite...and depending on what age I am when or if this ever happens, I may still be fertile and we MAY decide to procreate. And when and if this ever happens, we will likely move to the suburbs for better schools and have to eat at restaurants with our kids just like this one. But lemme tell you something, when/if that happens, I will raise my kids like my parents, may they rest in peace, raised me...I WILL NOT LET MY %$#@ING KIDS CLIMB FURNITURE AND LET THEM CLIMB ON PATRONS.....and if I do accidentally lose control of my kids and they climb on the back of patrons, I will apologize gratiously and I WILL NOT tell the patron, who will likely be another urban socialite clone without kids, THAT IT IS HER PROBLEM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Ugh, soccer moms and their dependency on Ritalin.... Yeah, I probably just pissed off a lot of people..."
Chris D.,"Dublin, CA",14,105,2,3.0,6/13/2009,"It was good/ok.  I ordered the philly cheesesteak sandwich which was ok.  I'd go back but I would definitely order something different.  If you want a good cheesesteak sandwich go to Methany's in the Blackhawk Plaza, they are the best I've had in the East Bay. Luckily the service was good."
Marigold M.,"Fremont, CA",15,166,98,5.0,10/19/2013,"It's rare for me to give a 5 star to any establishment. So why here? It was busy they quoted us 40 min wait, it was only 20. Server (forgot your name I'm so sorry) 2 sweet girls who came frequently to our table to check on us. Our drinks were never empty. She was knowledgeable about the food and answered my questions. Even packed up our food. I had shrimp scampi and steak Diane the steak is what I'm really giving the 5. I have never had someone cook medallion sized steaks to a perfect medium raw EVER! Olive Garden always messes up. And this was the first time it was cooked perfect and my cook was hot well seasoned ad the sauces were delicious. I wanna I back already !"
Aaron B.,"El Cerrito, CA",69,13,3,4.0,10/14/2011,"This was my first time here, the service was really good. I ordered the Buffalo Blast and Spinach Dip, no complaints whatsoever with the appetizers. For the entree, the Chicken Bellagio, still good no complaints. I would shy away from the mojitos, even thought they're good in taste, not too alcohol in them. Be sure to reserve ahead of time."
Lynsey T.,"Livermore, CA",236,133,28,3.0,1/13/2009,"I have gone for Lunch and Dinner many times over the few years that they have been open. Sometimes I was wowed and other times I was disappointed in the service and luke warm food.  Every time I always leave thinking about how I enjoyed the looking around because the decor and lighting is so nice. They did a very good job in that area.  Not an everyday thing, but once in a while is alright I guess."
Jonny A.,"Fremont, CA",213,287,252,5.0,2/17/2011,"You already know this place is insanely good. Why am I even reviewing it?! Okay, so we went on a Saturday and it looked packed but we were given the option for immediate outdoor seating so we took it -- it was a beautiful day anyway. The mini corn dogs are yum. The hummus and pita bread is alright -- the hummus wasn't as rich as I wanted it to be but the bread was great. My chicken medeira (sp?) was on point. The banana cream pie cheesecake or whatever was a dream come true. I tried one of their cocktails -- something with pineapple juice -- ehh, I say pass on it. Just order a water. Or soda. With over 200 items, you'll find SOMETHING you want."
Abigail V.,"Union City, CA",31,73,2,4.0,11/15/2011,Long wait but yummy food. Customer service is awesome and its pretty clean.
Kelli S.,"Antioch, CA",121,31,6,2.0,1/4/2012,"Went to my niece's birthday 11/11/11, of course they were crowded as usual.  Told us 45 minutes, so we went into the mall and they were calling us 15 minutes later.  Okay.  Our waiter, obviously overworked.  Somehow, they managed to deliver my niece's burger to the wrong table, but instead of an explanation up front, they just set everyone else's food down and went on about their business.  I had to flag him down once he stopped ducking around corners and then he said ""Oh the manager hasn't come over yet?""  Not that anyone informed us that a manager was coming.  Then one manager comes into our section but starts with a different customer, party of 1 + baby instead of our party of 7.  Apparently this customer had a lot of complaints because then the manager sat down.  Niece - still no food.  Her birthday. So finally another manager comes over and starts asking if my niece wants soup or salad.  I flagged her over and told her ""she didn't order soup or salad, she ordered a burger, and we've been waiting so long, I'm sure it's ready, so go get it"".  Which she promptly did, which means it was probably getting cold because by this time our original server was gone on break.  The didn't try to accomodate my niece in any other way.  We asked the new server to remove the burger from the bill and he got super defensive saying that he didn't know, etc.  No one expected him to know, but go ask the manager to remove it now and save the attitude for later. When it was removed and they brought me my change, the money was ripped in half.  I asked for bills that weren't ripped so that I could use them for BART and got a total eye roll and more attitude.  Heavy sigh, I didn't tell you to get a job at the Cheesecake Factory.  LUCKILY, their food is consistent and usually good. That's the only reason for the second start."
guess w.,"Pleasanton, CA",0,86,3,4.0,3/10/2010,"I really like the Cheesecake Factory's salmon. I am sure it has a lot of salt but if you eat it on occasion it won't hurt. Such a wide array of cheesecakes and for the most part, they are oh so delicious. Pros: Convenient location when out shopping.  Good customer service Cons: Very busy place, no reservations allowed"
Troy S.,"Oakland, CA",9,13,2,2.0,4/9/2011,"Pretty dang expense for the service and substance you receive, if you ask me. Also, my sister already reviewed this restaurant, but I will never get over their idea of a glass of wine - the glass is DEFINITELY half empty - not metaphorically, but literally. We sent our glasses back and they looked at us sheepishly as though we were homicidal alcoholics or something (only on my better days, I guess)."
Michael K.,"Concord, CA",90,51,,4.0,10/26/2011,I always enjoy my meal here. Yet every time I eat here I eat way too much food. Great selection of food and cheesecakes. There's something for everyone here.
Jess C.,"San Francisco, CA",279,429,22,4.0,1/18/2009,"One of my all time favorite chain places to eat.  I can honestly say that there hasn't been one thing I have ordered on the menu that I didn't like.  The only thing I hate about the restaurant is that they don't take reservations so there's always quite a wait.  I visited the Pleasanton one for the first time yesterday.  I arrived around 11:45am for an early lunch so to avoid any crowd. Our waitress was extremely pleasant and had a smile on the whole time.  This trip, I opted for the garlic noodles with chicken...extra garlic.  I also ordered the buffalo blasts appetizers.  You can't go wrong with the buffalo blasts if you're a big fan of buffalo wings!  They are tender chicken pieces wrapped in a skin and fried, then served with bleu cheese and hot sauce.  So good!  The garlic noodles were pretty good.  I'll have to admit that I was expecting them to be like the Crustaceans kind but when will I learn that I can only get that from the Anh family restaurants? haha. For dessert, because it is the Cheesecake Factory and all, we decided to try their new one which was blueberry swirled into a white chocolate cheesecake with crumbled blueberry crust.  If you like the white chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake, I think you'd really enjoy the blueberry one.  Cheesecake Factory is always a safe choice.  You always get variety, good food, and extremely generous portions."
