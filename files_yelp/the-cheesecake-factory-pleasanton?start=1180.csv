Vanessa M.,"Hayward, CA",143,29,26,4.0,7/23/2013,"This Cheesecake Factory saved me when I was in a pinch. It was my fiance's 30th birthday and I wanted to surprise him with a dinner with all his closest friends. We were going to go to a different restaurant at first, but when I tried to increase my reservation there from 10 to 20 a couple days before, the restaurant refused to accommodate my party... which is another Yelp review in itself... Anyway, back to Cheesecake Factory, the management team there was so accommodating, and although they don't take reservations, when I explained my situation over the phone that morning, they made sure my party was taken care of--thank you to Brandi, the manager that helped us when we got there! Our waiter was also really good (i can't remember his name anymore) he was fresh out of training but handled our large group very well; he was very patient and kind. My fiance was surprised and we all had a great time. This restaurant really saved the day :-)"

Ashley J.,"San Ramon, CA",48,46,40,2.0,3/27/2011,"I always expect better from The Cheesecake Factory, however, I have yet to experience it. Do I keep coming back? Of course. They have an extensive menu where someone is sure to find something they crave and yummy cheesecake. I just wish the food was better, as well as service. Step it up Cheesecake Factory!"
Peter K.,"Pleasanton, CA",2,42,1,2.0,12/2/2010,"Can anyone tell my why this places is so busy? I don't find their food to be anything special, including my kids they like to go there. I guess they like their cheese cake. I have to admit their cheese cake is pretty decent, Reason for 2 stars, other than that the wait and their food I would give 1 star."
Ethan C.,"Castro Valley, CA",9,108,,4.0,3/25/2013,"Why am I reviewing a chain restaurant?  Well I think this place deserves it's credit.  Out of the chain restaurants I think this place is the best.  They have an extensive menu.and the food is always good portions and consistant.  Yeah, you do have wait to get a table but it's better than settling for pf Chang's. Some of favorites dishes: chicken Madeira, miso salmon, chicken bellagio, jambolaya."
Jackie D.,"Fremont, CA",131,298,1,4.0,11/1/2008,"Cheesecake Factory is pretty good. It's super busy, a lot of the times, but they manage to have pretty good service and food. I've tried many of their selections in their huge menu such as the Chicken Picatta, their Factory Burger, The Navajo, their grilled salmon, and the list can go on and on.  The fall time brings one of my favorite cheesecakes, Pumpkin Cheesecake. So, I couldn't leave my visit here without a slice in hand. YUM!  Yes, it's your typical chain restaurant, connected to a mall, but they are doing something right. Our service was great tonight and I'll definitely come back!"
David S.,"San Ramon, CA",0,3,,5.0,2/16/2014,"This place is marvelous. Even the architectural aspects are beautiful. The high ceilings set up a great environment for a meal. The menu has a large variety of foods that will satisfy any kind of eater. The wait is a bit long though, averaging on about a half hour."
Cindy H.,"San Leandro, CA",18,358,,3.0,6/21/2011,"This was my first time eating at Cheesecake Factory.  I knew they had good food, but I also knew that they are always rated one of the restaurants that served the most unhealthy dishes. We were first served 2 small loves of bread with butter.  They were both soft and warm.  I preferred the wheat bread just because it was healthier.  After 20 mins, my four seasons pizza finally came.  The pizza consisted a slice of each of these toppings: prosciutto, mozzarella and tomato, spinach, and mushrooms.  The mushroom slice was delicious.  It wasn't the typical white mushrooms.  I think it was portabella mushrooms.  The prosciutto was tasty, but it was too salty.  I couldn't finish the rest even though I got the lunch-sized pizza.  It also came with a big mixed greens salad."
Sarina A.,"West Covina, CA",667,550,194,5.0,7/31/2008,"Another Yelper friend of mine - Jeff T. and myself decided to venture to Cheesecake Factory for their $1.50 cheesecake extravaganza!! I'm from So.Cal and our usual waiting time is 1-1.5 hours on any given peak time. So considering this was going to be a very packed event, I figured the waiting time would be 2-2.5 hours. To my surprise it was 1.5 hours and even though that's still a long waiting period, I was fine with it since it exceeded my expectations. Luckily, there's a mall right next door to help pass the time. I'm suspecting this particular location is not located in a very populated area as the ones in So.Cal are. So that might help to the less waiting time issue. The service was very good and the food was excellent. We were starving from the long wait so anything we ate would have been good. But I love the food at Cheesecake Factory and it didn't let me down. I love that I have enough for lunch the next day too! We finally move onto to the cheesecake portion and I had my usual dulce de leche and Jeff had Tiramisu. Both were yummy and quite large. I purposely didn't eat too much of my dinner to save roOm for the cheesecake and I still couldn't finish it! I was bummed. But boy was it delicious! YUM YUM IN MY TUM TUM!!"
Jeff T.,"San Francisco, CA",64,54,24,4.0,7/31/2008,"Once upon a time there existed a little block of cream cheese named Petit-Suisse. Growing up his friends Bacardi and Mascarpone would call him by his nickname, Suisse. All Suisse ever wanted to do was grow up to be something special. One day, Bacardi came by with Lady Mascarpone in his right arm. He approached Suisse: ""We are going on an adventure,"" bellowed Bacardi, ""and surely you must come along!"" Suisse became excited. He had never been on an adventure before. Suisse agreed. So off they went, the three of them on their adventure. Then one day, the 3 of them happened upon a large bowl. Curious they all jumped in and realized they had found their calling. Suisse was happy. He spent the rest of his days sandwiched between Mr. Bacardi and Lady Mascarpone lounging around for that is what little cream cheeses do when they are happy... ...until he was devoured by ME for a dollar fifty...MUAHAHAH...NOMNOMNOM!"
Gary S.,"Dublin, CA",82,24,,5.0,10/28/2011,"If you ever want to see what professionalism and a good staff means that care and take care of their customers, it's Cheesecake factory. Every location from SF to here are top notch. Their food is great and cheese cake is ohhhh so good!"
Desi J.,"Stockton, CA",0,2,,5.0,8/10/2014,"I recently went to this restaurant around 10 pm and the atmosphere was very positive and the vibe was upbeat. The set-up is very nice and consists of multiple types of seating areas to accommodate various customer needs or preferences. The food was great, I ordered a steak dish (Surprisingly can't remember the name) and it was very delicious. It came with mashed potatoes, mushrooms, and a little bit of caramelized onions. The sauce was very delicious and had the right amount of seasoning to it. There wasn't too much or too less of salt and it was complimented the steak very cohesively. The Louisiana chicken pasta was very delicious also and I must say that I like large portions of food and the portions were just right. The appetizers like the crab wontons and veggie avocados bites-sized snacks were one of the best foods I've ever had. Fresh and well prepared. Some restaurants don't put in too much effort for their appetizers compared to their entrées but this place certainly puts a 100% effort in all of their food. Our server, Tina was very helpful in terms of recommending us our food and took care of everything we needed. A VERY PLEASANT EXPERIENCE IN PLEASANTON."
Chris B.,"Turlock, CA",2,3,,5.0,3/5/2012,"The red velvet cheesecake is heavenly and my absolute favorite!!!! I always enjoy the menu as well, with all the great selections! Yum :-)"
linda c.,"Davis, CA",1,65,4,1.0,6/16/2008,"Absolutely the WORST experience of my life.  Came here with a party of 15 and was told that there is a 1 hour 30-2 hr wait. The hostess definitely needs to wipe the smile off her face because I was ready to strangle her. We waited 3+hrs, yes 3 hours, to get seated. If she would just tell us that, we wouldn't waste our life waiting for nothing.  Service was not good. The food was not great (food poisoning for some of my friends and myself). Floors so dirty I almost slipped! But... the one star is for the yummy colada."
linh d.,"Dublin, CA",4,248,77,3.0,4/19/2011,"Although this restaurant is a famous chain, I still never truly appreciate their food. The food is always rich, greasy and salty. I really wish they can cut it back so that you can actually TASTE the food which would earn a 4 stars. The only thing great about this place and all other Cheesecakes is the fact that the ambiance is nice, reminds of some places in Vegas. Other than that, not worth the wait or cheesecake... I'll just bake my own cheesecake. ;)"
Pearl V.,"San Jose, CA",1246,993,3794,2.0,5/18/2008,"This branch gets 2 stars for lying about the expected wait time. It took almost a half hour (or more) longer. Lunch time is extremely busy that we almost even left to go to P.F. Chang's next door, but stuck it out for the birthday girl... (my sister) since she happens to LIKE Cheesecake Factory. It sucked because with such a large party we ended up in one of those long aisle-style seating areas where they push tables together to make one long one.  Anyway, my food was just okay; albeit a tad oily (I had the Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic), but even for the lunch sized portions, I had plenty to box up to go. I would rather pay less for a much smaller portion. What is up with their freakishly-sized meals? I should've just ordered a kids meal. Oh yeah, they don't offer any kid meals. Stupid, I tell you."
Athens r.,"Union City, CA",56,134,,4.0,3/21/2009,"I still love CF even if its an hour wait. Dont be stupid to be at CF on a not so free day though. The wait is always worth it. On a no meat day, and if the bistro shrimp has become over rated, here comes the Fish of the day choice-- salted and lemoned, plain as i need to have it (but i do not prefer)--- it was still good. The servers are always with their best foot forward. (I hope they have uniformly maintained white shoes for the serving attire coz it spoils the neat white presentation of how they should be. Food has always been good, and the sweetened green tea never fails. I said it before and Ill say it again. I luv cheesecake and im still to try other locales. SF. check. Pleasanton, check. San jose, check. next ....... Palo Alto, here I come."
Sharlene D.,"Honolulu, HI",342,46,46,3.0,4/9/2009,"My cousin and I went to this branch for an early dinner. We were seated in no time! I guess the best time to go to an always-populated restaurant such as this would be 5pm.  We were greeted by our waiter, Miguel. He was such a sweetheart! We were given great service...and he did add his opinion or two about what we ordered (which is always helpful, as the OVERWHELMING binded menu gets me everytime!). On this visit, my cousin and i shared a small plate of fried calamari (i believe they only serve this from 4-6pm) and an order of avocado rolls. Fried calamari - standard...not anything to really rave about. Avocado rolls - Miguel was right. THEY ARE HABIT FORMING. Drizzle a bit of the sauce on top? Delectable!  The portion size was more than perfect for us (we were REALLY hungry haha); in addition, they brought out our bread and butter. You can never go wrong! On to main entrees.... My cousin ordered their cajun jambalaya pasta and I ordered the farfalle chicken pasta. The amount of food was quite generous! All I can say is that we both brought enough leftovers to last us another dinner. I wasn't able to try out her dish, but as far as the pasta went, it was alright. Once again, not the greatest pasta in the world but it'd suffice. Last but not least, their cheesecake. We made it a point to order a slice for each person. She chose the white chocolate macadamia nut caramel and I the tiramisu. Exceptional!!!! Her slice reminded me of caramacs (Hawaiian candies)... and tiramisu. Can't go wrong! All in all, I thought it was a great Cheesecake factory dinner. While the food was mediocre, our helpful waiter and yummy desserts balanced it out!"
G P.,"Tracy, CA",10,79,26,3.0,5/25/2009,"I like it but i dont love it. The menu is way too big too many choices. I like variety but there is soo much to choose the task becomes daunting. I usually go for a cajun style chicken sandwich or cobb salad maybe sliders and thats it. My friends and family dig there food I dunno it just doesnt do it for me, you have this huge eleborate place with a crazy slightly overpriced menu and yet your just okay. They do make bomb ass cheese cake so its not just a clevor name. I dont know if its seasonal, but the pumpkin spiced cheese cake and the espresso cheese cake are the best. Im not a big desert guy but i will knock one of those beast out. I dont remeber her name but there is a younger brunette woman who bartends there and makes awesome drinks, she is the only one there who knows how to make a manhattan, She is very personable, my wife and I spent and afternoon there once hanging out chatting with her and trying different drinks, $160 later it was time to go but well worth it. She makes an awesome strawberry martini, which even as a guy i will admit i had to have one it was awesome."
