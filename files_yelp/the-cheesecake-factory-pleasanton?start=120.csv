James S.,"Dublin, CA",0,4,,4.0,12/10/2017,I visited this cheesecake with friends recently it was a pleasure to visit the staff was friendly and food was prepared good and the time from ordering to serving was not at bad. I would love to visit this place more often now.
Stephen H.,"Hayward, CA",38,105,3,5.0,4/11/2017,"If I want good food and alot of it, Cheesecake Factory!  Huge menu, quality food, good atmosphere.  Been coming here for years, this place has been pretty consistent, no complaints here.... Wait can be a bit long, the place is.popular, what do you expect?"
Rexy T.,"Foster City, CA",58,19,4,4.0,9/14/2017,"Third time coming to this location. Took my cousin here for her birthday celebration. We were seated in less than 10 minutes. I ordered the hibachi steak, my favorite, at this restaurant. It's always on point, the mushroom, the tempura asparagus are always delicious. The reason for 4 star is because my cousin didn't like the meatloaf. It was too mushy and a tad salty. I felt bad because it was her birthday too. I ended up sharing my steak and she loved it. We came back after shopping for some Cheesecakes. I ordered the vanilla bean and she got the banana cheesecake. Our overall experience was great. We will definitely come back and she'll order the hibachi steak next time."
Daniel W.,"Fremont, CA",131,247,112,2.0,11/5/2017,"Went to The Cheesecake Factory for brunch today and I wish I hadn't. The wait for a table was 30 minutes and then the wait to get the food after we were seated was a full hour. I was tempted to get up and leave if the food didn't come out within minutes after we hit the one-hour mark. The waitress could sense my impatience and came by twice to say the food was coming out soon and could she get us anything while we were waiting. The food was just OK. My wife's hash browns were burnt. We gained one hour today by setting our clocks back for daylight savings; unfortunately, I squandered away the hour I gained by spending it waiting for food at The Cheesecake Factory."
Remy M.,"Berkeley, CA",0,32,2,5.0,9/18/2017,"Had lunch here again Saturday afternoon! Was blessed to have Deja, as our server, she is quite charming. Our meal was great, and Sammy the manager, was on point, with having my hot fudge Sunday re-made. Service 5 Food 5 Manager 5 Thank you again, for another fabulous experience.  Thank you...Nate"
Teresa Q.,"Bay Area, CA",4,107,60,1.0,2/20/2017,"I'm breaking down this review. Waitress customer service: 5 STARS Our waitress was nice, and went above and beyond to make sure our wait was less uncomfortable than  it was. Wait Time for food after being seated: 1 STAR. It took over an 1 hour for us to get our food, while people who had been there for 30 minutes.  Food: 2 START. Louisiana Pasta was SUPER GREASY! Pasta was floating in grease. Everything was ok, nothing special. Needless to say, this will be the last time I come here. I'd rather go to Nordstrom Cafe, where I will actually enjoy every aspect of my meal and the service."
Selene A.,"Santa Ana, CA",0,2,1,1.0,6/13/2017,We arrived at 8:30pm on a Tuesday night and took them 2 hours for 2 simple plates that would usually take 30 min for Both. Food was cold and steak was hard to the point it was impossible to chew. The waitress was nice and gave us free salads and cheesecake but that doesn't make up for the 2 hr wait and nasty food.
Ninet M.,"Walnut Creek, CA",61,117,119,1.0,4/11/2017,"If I could I would have given them no or minus star. Someone from health dep better give them a surprise visit. When asked for the manager one of the other servers came and said she was the manager ?!?!?! Disgusting food, extranet questionable."
James M.,"Brentwood, CA",0,29,8,2.0,9/7/2017,"Cute Restaruant, not very big like some of the other ones so the wait tends to be long. We were 9 people but only one of our meals was good. The other 8 dishes looked delicious, but lacked any flavor. Like they ran out of spices in the kitchen and just continued to cook without salt, pepper, or spices. We had the chicken piccata for example and it had like 10 cappers in the whole dish. That is after  we asked for extra cappers. All looks no flavor. Cheesecakes were good."
Nicky T.,"San Ramon, CA",69,89,349,2.0,4/9/2017,"Quite pricy. Food is nothing special. Generous portions which attempt to even out the insane cost.  Brilliant customer service, but not enough waiters/waitresses. Don't understand the hype of this place. Constantly crowded, with lines going out the door, and wait times generally over 45 minutes.  Huge restaurant. Nice location. The only thing that seems to stand out to me is the dessert. Food is good, don't get me wrong, but I would not pay this high of a price for just another meal. Desserts offered are brilliant choices. Cakes to the side of the entrance are presented beautifully, put on gorgeous display.  Overall, food is nothing amazing. Customer service was good, and the food is on the heavier side of the price spectrum. Extensively long waiting time, for a meal not even worth waiting for."
Lillian T.,"Livermore, CA",18,21,15,1.0,3/3/2017,"This review is for the bakery side. One word: Slow. I drove 30 mins to get here to buy 2 slices of cheesecake. Why do I have to wait another 20+mins?? And those with slice of ejoys certificates... a worker there turned me away after waiting 20 mins to tell me I needed to print them out. So I had to come back a different day. ""E""-joy my butt.  My mom went there on a different occasion and the manager apparently told her the email certificates were fine. Wtf"
Melanie K.,"Dublin, CA",59,24,3,1.0,3/28/2017,Currently just finished dinner Service was alright  Food... worst ever I had the nachos and a salad  Nachos burnt and stale and not hot at all Salad was not fresh at all My brothers bacon bacon (burger and fries) Was ok fries stale Sister had chicken and shrimp gumbo  Watered down  And on top of the food being nasty  Food came out late tables around us who ordered after us received their meals before us We didn't even finish the food There would be photos of the dishes we had but the waitress hurried off with them Cheesecake your quality has lowered not a little but in a huge way There's a big difference since I've last been here Today is a Tuesday so it's not as crazy busy like it would be on the weekends Just ruined our appetite
Carly B.,"Fremont, CA",29,181,208,3.0,9/8/2016,"The cheesecake factory is your standard chain restaurant, with a menu of basically any dish you'd ever want, and then a ton of different cheesecakes. I usually get the American burger which is like a big mac but fancier. It is also gigantic and I never have enough room to finish the fries that come along with it, let alone order cheesecake. It used to be great. We hadn't been to this location in about a year, and MAN was it a disappointment. First we were told we could sit right away if we sat outside. I asked if they had heat lamps (cold night) and they said they did, so we went for it because we were starving (and otherwise would have to wait about 25 minutes). I got the burger I normally get and the wait time was pretty standard. The food, however, was not. The burger was super greasy and the fries tasted like they had been deep-fried multiple times. I felt like throwing up afterwards. Then the waitress took FOREVER to bring our check. At this point we were done with our food and starting to get cold. She finally comes over with it and my husband puts a card in. He goes to look at the check one more time and she is walking over, but then sees this and walks away. Ahhh come back I try to say, but she doesn't hear me. Then we wait 15 minutes in the freezing cold all over again for her to get the check. And more waiting as it is processed. Our entire dinner took about 2 hours when we knew exactly what we wanted and ordered right away. Ridiculous. It's also annoying that they don't show prices for alcohol. I asked how much the cider was and the waitress had to go away to find out. Another time we ordered a cocktail without asking about the price, and it turned out being more than my meal! Never again."
Patricia J.,"Pleasanton, CA",49,63,20,1.0,4/2/2017,Well it's gone down hill for the last year!! Also never DoorDash... salad was horrible bacon burger was dry the bun was hard as a rock!!!! Never again!!!!!!!!!!
D T.,"San Ramon, CA",6,60,9,1.0,4/22/2017,"Horrible location. Horrible service! Horrible sanitation issue! Horrible food! Horrible everything! The next time I'm craving for Cheesecake Factory, I would drive up all the way to SF and dine there. Utensils are filthy it seemed that it has not been wash, one of the glass still have lipsticks on it! WTF!!  Always ordered avocado egg roll and calamari for appetizer. Egg rolls were soggy and calamari were not crunchy, seemed like they had been sitting on the side for a long time. For main course, we ordered steak Dianne, medium rare, chicken Marsala, and bang bang chicken and shrimp. Steak was cook much more to a well done side, so tough and chewy. Chicken was also overcooked, it was so dry and rubbery. For the chicken and shrimp, the peanut/curry sauce was so salty!  When we told about the situation to our server, she just replied ""that's how we always cooked our food and no one complaint!"" I'm so lost for words. Re train all your employees even your cooks. What a disaster! Not worth waiting for 30mins of my time and $$!! Waiter asked if we wanted to see the dessert menu but when we were about to put in our order, everything that we wanted were out!! This includes latte!! Really!? How can you run out of Latte? Manager needs to be fired!!"
Lame Lake Meese Z.,"San Francisco, CA",19,194,28,1.0,8/21/2016,"The cheesecakes used to be beautiful, now they look like an alcoholic carny made them.  The lemon meringue cheesecake used to have sculpted swirls of torched meringue, now it has a thin, flat top with painted-on scorch marks. I got this cake last year and it looked great-is there a new manager? Look at my photo. I bought this cake for someone's birthday. If you know someone who's too happy on their birthday and you want to bring them down-this is the cake."
James R.,"Suisun City, CA",167,496,658,3.0,2/15/2017,"Came here the weekend before Valentines Day (trying to get a heads up before the crowd) and ultimately failed because the spot was crazy busy around 4pm on a Saturday. We didn't mind waiting and it took about 30 minutes to be seated. The waitress we had was very nice and attentive. I ordered the lunch portion of the shrimp and sausage pasta. My girlfriend and I shared a strawberry shake. The strawberry shake was to die for. It was fantastic and tasted great (which hit the spot because I was kinda burning up that day). The food was just decent. My pasta was not bad, but it just wasn't my cup of tea. The shrimp was not really whole pieces and kind of looked like the D quality stuff. The sausage was good, but the sauce was almost too seafood like for me which I wasn't expecting. Overall, the place was nice and staff friendly, but for what I paid I was a bit disappointed in the quality of the overall food (except the milkshake that was amazing)."
Michelle G.,"Brentwood, CA",44,3,2,1.0,12/19/2016,"I am a huge fan of Cheesecake Factory but the service we received today was no acceptable. I would give this rating a negative but since yelp doesn't have that yet I would have to settle with a one. I do not understand how management allows such behaviors from  the employees. I have worked in places where it can get busy and overwhelming but the experience that happened today does not repeat itself.  It all started when one of my colleagues went to go put our name on the waiting list and the host said it would be a 45 min wait. After 45 min, they went to go check on how much longer and the host rudely said that it was going to be an hour wait and she didn't say 45 when clearly 9 of us heard. We were quite a big party so I understood if it took longer so at the 56 min mark our boss went for an update and they told her that they were cleaning the table. The thing that made me mad the most is that parties of 2, 3, and 4s where being seated while we waited there. So from waiting from 9:15 to almost 10:15 without an acknowledgment for thank you for waiting would of been fine. THEY WERENT EVEN BUSY!!!! You know how I knew because I saw waiters and hostess talking and laughing.  Once we were seated we were all extremely hungry. I heard a remark of the waiters in-charged of that section that said ""Really, I have them"" I thought that was extremely rude because since we were a big party we were going to bring a lot of money to the establishment but I was happy we didn't get the waiter that was in-charged of that section we got a nice gentleman that almost made me forget that rocky start. The food was excellent and on point.  As we were about to leave the establishment 3 colleagues heard another remark from another employee. She said ""FINALLY! Leave."" Under her breathe but to her luck 3 people heard what she said. My boss thought that the whole experience was unacceptable and wanted to talk to a manager. To top this wonderful cake the MANAGER kind of brushed it off. Now it makes sense of how the employees are so customer service inefficient if they don't have a role model to follow. To put the cherry on top that same girl that made the same remark was talking to a colleague of hers and she was just laughing and looking in our direction.  If this gets to corporate. I hope you guys re-train most of your employees on customer service and how to efficiently coordinate especially on the hostess since they are the first face we see on coming in. Also I hope there is some compensation over this horrendous experience."
Jason B.,"Modesto, CA",0,17,1,1.0,9/17/2017,"I called to ask if they took reservations and they said no not on weekends. I asked ok how long is the wait.  I heard her yelling back and forth ""...50? 15? 50 15?"".  Then she said 15minutes to me.  I repeated it 3 times to her, and said ONE FIVE fifteen to be sure.  She said yes yes. I drive over there and said I just called and she said about 15min wait.  He laughs at me and said ""no, 50minutes"".  Being jerked around told one thing and go there then blown off.  The two girls working just kept their backs turned.  I know they were aware of the wrong answer and the impact.  The other time I went there I didn't call in advance and was told also of a hour wait so decided to get carry out deserts instead.  They tasted ok but pricey and not worth it."
Denise F.,"Discovery Bay, CA",80,1017,209,3.0,6/23/2016,"The parking is really easy to find, service can be slow when it's busy, the food is decent, but nothing I crave when my mind wanders while I'm hungry.. The drinks are good, and the desserts are pretty good.. But this place isn't that great if you have food allergies or do t eat dairy, because there's dairy in pretty much everything here.  The place is always pretty busy somehow, and some of the servers I've gotten don't know crap about the ingredients in some of the meals. Also, I've had food come out lukewarm before.. Not a place I'd go if it were my own decision!"
