Zen M.,"Livermore, CA",1,47,1,4.0,7/6/2011,"Service is good, restaurant and bathrooms are pretty clean, and food is usually pretty good (depending on what you order--wouldn't recommend non-American food on the menu). Also desserts...oh man...They're really good. Food's pretty heavy though. Would recommend this place!"
Stephanie C.,"Hayward, CA",145,21,,5.0,4/20/2011,My sister and I came here for lunch on one of my few day a week to relax and boy did our Server Donya (sorry if I botched the spelling) made our trip worth it! She made sure our drinks stayed full and even helped bring us to heaven with the Red Velvet Cheesecake which is to die for!!! I would recommend coming here again...good food and service.
Sonja B.,"Livermore, CA",9,33,1,1.0,10/29/2011,Was told about an hour for a table and it took 1 hour 45 minutes with no explanations. Won't go again
Bob S.,"Castro Valley, CA",24,31,13,5.0,6/25/2011,"Great food!  Great service!  I've tried almost everything on the menu, no disappointments!  Try the avocado egg rolls mmmmmmm!!!!"
SCoo B.,"Tracy, CA",0,23,3,4.0,10/23/2010,"This place is always great to bring family ive been to this particular location and the waitresses are always nice and seem very welcoming. I dont know why but i mostly order their pastas and the ones ive tried are always good. I have no major complaints about this place, its always lively but i guess i only gave it a 4 because it seems crowded all the time..but we all know exactly why its always crowded;)"
David L.,"Fremont, CA",24,368,24,4.0,9/5/2008,"I find that whenever one decides to go to a Cheesecake Factory, you must show up extremely early to avoid any kind of ridiculous wait.  Having to wait doesn't make me want the food more or like it any better, it just irritates me.   We were seated right away since we beat the Friday lunch crowd, so I was able to enjoy my food.  Our server was a bit slow and displayed too much insincere friendliness.  We started out with their roadside sliders (4 mini-burgers as appetizers, $7.50), which were really awesome.  I could have easily made this my meal and be satisfied, but I had to share.  My miso salmon ($12.95 for lunch portion) was nice, too, but a bit small, but it's reduced price for lunch.  They give you 5 pieces of snow peas, mainly as decorations.   Bottom Line:  Nice look and feel inside, though very noisy dining room when busy.  Food is consistent."
Danielle D.,"Dublin, CA",3,33,,2.0,7/15/2008,"We've wanted to try this location out since it was built - but every time we went by there was a line out the door. So - of course I'm thinking it's gonna be fantastic!! R I G H T  I felt like I was Ben Stiller in Meet the Parents - the airport scene. Step aside SIR (when there was nobody there). It was about 3pm when we checked in. Then the hostess tells me to step to the left and someone will seat me. To the left?? You mean you want me to stand in this huge tree you have in the lobby? So I can move out of the way of the invisible people? O K After about 30 seconds of standing in the tree we were seated at our dirty table with dirty plates. But, being the resourceful person I am - I took out wipes from the diaper bag and sent the plates back. Yes - obviously I am a glutton for punishment.  Server was nice - just not that good. Somehow every soda that was ordered at our table was mixed up. I got my son's root beer, he got handsome hubby's coke, and handsome hubby got my Diet. But wait - it gets better!  Four plates of food to time - shouldn't be that hard. Y U P - that is what you would think. Four plates of food that all came out at different times.   The only good part was that the food was really good. So maybe next time we'll order to go and eat in the parking lot??"
Abby S.,"Tracy, CA",128,197,628,3.0,5/18/2008,"If you don't have time just read this sentence: The service SUCKS and the food isn't good enough to be worth the hassle. However if you have a moment to enjoy my ire please read on. The menu items look fantastic, they have a HUGE selection that goes across various cuisines. (Japanese, Mexican, Italian, etc.) Their on-line menu kicks some serious tail! However they don't tell you how much you'll be paying for the food you see on the on-line menu and I ended up with a $35 lunch for 1 on the one and only occasion I ordered lunch to go. Sadly the food is just OK nothing that makes you say ""WOW"" and for the price I think it should be a explosion of taste that leaves you reeling and wondering if the amazing cuisine fairy smacked you over the head with her wand! However, let us take into consideration that the name of this place IS the Cheesecake factory. I find their cheesecake and carrot cake divine. The only thing I get here now is cheesecake to go and I make them bring it out to the car. Yes, you can call in an order, park in their ""to go spaces"" and they'll bring it out to you, another nice feature. For the ""to go"" feature and the desserts they get 3 stars from me. The place is populated by people who don't give a donkey's butt if you're there or not. We were left standing waiting for a table while 3 other couples that came in after us were seated! (no, they didn't have reservations) When we let them know about the issue they still made us wait another 10 minutes for a table. So, basically I would highly recommend you order cheesecake or carrot cake for takeout and enjoy it at home in your PJs rather than deal with the annoyance of substandard food and indifferent employees. The desserts really ARE good."
Brian M.,"Pleasanton, CA",0,4,,1.0,12/20/2013,Poor service. Sets expectations they can't deliver on. I have been at the store for an hour at this point picking up a cake I ordered two days ago. Go somewhere else. They won't care or notice...for now.
Michelle M.,"Belmont, CA",197,1852,605,3.0,1/3/2009,"This is a small Cheesecake Factory!  I don't  understand why?  This mall doesn't even have a food court, so why be small on the restaurants?  Well it takes a long time to get seated, but that goes for any Cheesecake Factory.  However these waiters are speedy and took our order and before I knew it we were eating.  It kind of sucks because you don't get to really relax and settle, you wait, you eat fast, then you leave."
John D.,"Fremont, CA",33,44,4,4.0,1/24/2009,"Cheesecake Factory...I guess once you've been to one you've been to all.  Yet this one is a little different in the sense that since it's in Stoneridge Mall, it gets EXTREMELY busy! The pastas are pretty good and C.F. usually have a nice selection of what kind of pastas to try.   Other than the long wait, and I suggest make a reservation first, the place is pretty good to take someone on a date or just to have a meal with some friends."
NEAL F.,"Castro Valley, CA",0,6,,2.0,10/18/2008,"Well, what do you expect from a chain restaurant that has such a voluminous menu that they can't possibly do everything well? Go there for the atmosphere and the cheesecake but don't expect much from the regular food.  Was there recently for lunch. The good: No waiting, pleasant staff, and my Cuban Sandwich was very good. Nice combination of ham,pork, melted cheese in a pretty large sandwich on artisan bread. The bad: My wife's Cobb salad was unrecognizable. It looked like an uncooked vegetable casserole. The elements were diced so finely you couldn't tell what you were eating, and she had to ask for the bleu cheese dressing to put on it. What were they thinking? Waitstaff also had to be reminded to bring simple things like bread and water. Oh well, maybe we'll just consider for dessert or a place to hang out with friends. Otherwise, choose carefully."
Trish S.,"San Leandro, CA",383,139,26,4.0,3/20/2010,"Cheesecake factory is always good in my opinion. I used to rarely eat here, but now I find myself frequently dining here with my boyfriend. Although the food is not the healthiest and they give such large portions, I usually order food that's ""lower"" compared to others and bring a little bit more than half home. The bread is delicious and I sincerely like this restaurant primarily because their menu includes everything I like: hamburgers, pastas, sandwiches, etc. I dislike eating restaurants that only serve the same food, but in different wording (aka: pf chang).  The following are what I've eaten and my rating:  Pasta di Vinci: too much flavor 6/10  Spaghetti marinera: one of the simple pastas, but a favorite 8/10  Fetuccini Alfredo: just like any other kind, so good if you like it 6/10 Caramel chicken: Lots of flavor and if you like Asian flavored meats this will definitely appease your taste buds 7/10  Old factory burger: one of my favorites because the ""bun"" is their free sourdough bread 8/10  Fried calamari: usually delicious, but definitely share with people--you'll grow sick of it 7/10 Cheesesteak sandwich: really cheesey and the steak is decent 6/10  Four cheese pasta: very cheesy and simple flavoring 6/10  Hamburger sliders (appetizer): DELICIOUS! I just tried this tonight (Main reason why I decided to finally review this specific cheesecake factory). I found these ""little"" burgers to be terribly delicious. I've been searching for something to order that wouldn't break my wallet and also taste superb. I finally found it! The meat tastes great and so does the bun. Oh and it's $1 to add on fries (which I still had to bring home with 2/4 of the small burgers).  I never have enough room in my tummy for cheesecake. I've tried the regular and vanilla bean and they do taste sweet, but I just cannot justify 1,000 calories per slice.  Service is always amazing. Minus one star because no matter how much I love cheesecake factory I always wait at least 30 minutes to be seated (once it took over an hour). The wait is worth it and all, I just don't think a business can ever be ""perfect 5/5"" if I wait an hour almost every time to sit down."
Mark J.,"San Leandro, CA",0,2,,1.0,7/11/2013,"Great food. Don't call in to order. The person I spoke to did not listen well and she kept trying to rush me off the phone. slow. When I came to pick up my food, it spilled inside the bag. So I had to wait for them to prepare my order again. Once I did receive my order, there was no apology. Overall, the staff is a joke from a customer service perspective. This is the Cheesecake Factory in Pleasanton."
Rachel S.,"Sunol, CA",39,135,2,1.0,2/27/2008,"My hubby and I went here a few times, while the service was incredibly slow, the food is nothing to write home about, we liked to stop by after a morning of shopping. The last time we went - was a disaster. First we ate the usual, burgers and fries which are good. Then we split a piece of cheesecake.  On the way out, we picked up several different (about 6) slices of cheesecake to bring over to my fathers house. That night at my fathers, my family and I decided to sample the different cheesecakes. What a variety! We were all excited.  Oh man.  Holy smokes.  I will never forget how I felt a few hours later. We all got sick, including my husband who had only had some earlier with me at the restaurant.  And when I say sick, I mean Sick - with a capital ""S"". I don't want to go into great detail but I swear, every time I so much as see the sign for the cheesecake factory, my stomach turns.  Perhaps an ingredient had gone bad, milk spoiled, was a case of cheesecake overload, who knows? But I just can't bring myself to even go near the place ever again."
Mac D.,"Concord, CA",13,10,,4.0,6/29/2011,We always go here after going to the mall. All the appetizers are excellent and you can have a whole meal with just appetizers. The calamari is the best . Service is great except you have to wait because they are very busy. I highly recommend the place.
Scotty D.,"Pleasanton, CA",2049,1139,1426,4.0,3/2/2010,i have been going to this location since they first opened and i always order to go and use the curbside service. this is definitely the way to go when you want some great food and large portions when you just want to relax in front of the tv.  this past time i ordered 2 orders of the teriyaki chicken with all breasts and substituted the mashed potatoes for the rice. we always like alot of teriyaki sauce so we asked for extra sides of sauce and alot of the great brown bread to go along with it. they always hook it up with the portions. get the breasts and you have much more meat and no bones to deal with. and they definitely don't seem to skimp on the mashers and sometimes it's too much. this time around the portions were big as always and everything looked great but it didn't seem to have any teriyaki sauce on the chicken. usually they are glazed over nicely but this time they were seriously skimping on sauce. they did give an extra side but there had to be about a teaspoon size amount in the ramekin. when we picked up the order the girl even told us they were running low on teriyaki so they couldn't give us much of an extra side. they really should of took it off the menu for the night if they didn't have the right ingredients to prepare the dish. they hooked us up with the portion but this wasn't teriyaki chicken and just killed our expectations. what keeps this review at 4 stars is the great customer service we got when we called to speak to a manager. not only was he very polite and apologetic but he went out a gift card in the mail for $40 and that was more than what we payed for our meal. now i can go back for more very soon and even though i want to try so many things i will continue to order the teriyaki entree but next time the cooks should be beaten for even sending food home like that.
Kajal G.,"San Francisco, CA",141,415,436,1.0,3/20/2013,"I don't even know why I come here anymore- Apparently their own buzzer system for people waiting for a table is too complicated for the hosts delicate brain cause she buzzed us ""by accident"", wouldn't give us a new one and left us waiting by the hostess stand while we were bumped into several times by all the patrons who were coming and going. 15 minute wait my ass. As the lobby is slowly filling you cant tell everyone who comes in that the wait is 15 minutes. Service was no better.  No water refills. Waitress never checked in. Rushed us to order. Awful awful awful. Black waitress sucks at her job and needs to get fired. And she fucked up our order. They brought us the wrong dish twice before giving me a very sad version of what i ordered. The pasta we ordered was hard and undercooked. When we asked for the check she just kept clearing the plates away instead of getting it for us. If we weren't a 6 top with gratuity included I wouldn't have given her anything."
Niesha M.,"Oakland, CA",14,231,,3.0,5/1/2009,"I've been to this place a couple of times in the past with co workers.  Is it a specific reason why every Cheesecake Factory has to be crowded? I mean, the food is good but not spectacular. Some of it is way overpriced, although the portions are huge. I will say that the three stars is for the cheesecake. Delicious!"
Mrs. B.,"Hayward, CA",0,15,,4.0,8/31/2011,Hibachi Steak is off the hook!!! Staff is very friendly and knowledgable too! Too bad they don't take reservations though. :(
