Lori B.,"Danville, CA",0,9,,2.0,11/12/2013,"We haven't been to CF for a few months or possibly a year.  A very disappointing visit today.  We arrived about 1:20, not at all crowded and asked to eat outside in the very pleasant 75 degree weather.   We ordered within 10 minutes, but eventually when we had no food or bread, we requested bread.  Finally our order arrived at 2:00, a full 40 minutes after ordering.   The food was good, but 40 minutes on a slow afternoon is absolutely ridiculous!  Not one table outside had salt/pepper shakers and I had to go ask.  They seemed surprised that none were on the tables, yet only brought them to us, left all the other tables without.  The waiter was nice enough, but never made mention of why it took FOREVER to get our food to us!  Won't go back any time soon.  Our order was simply an Asian salad and orange chicken, neither of which would take any where close to 40 minutes to prepare!"
Mel G.,"Oakland, CA",11,187,235,3.0,1/10/2011,"The hunny buns brought me here on our anniversary. I liked it, I had an orange chicken served over rice. The orange chicken was crunchy and was great! I had to have the cheesecake. Thumbs up! I need to come back and try other items here. But for my first time! yay."
Connie M.,"Castro Valley, CA",0,5,1,5.0,9/17/2010,"I have eaten at the establishment several times.  The menu is extensive and has something for everyone!  Although everyone we have dealt with there is nice, I want to especially acknowledge Alex.  He is an excellent server, pleasant, informative and makes sure you are happy with your meal.  Ask for him, I am sure you will not be disappointed!"
Emily S.,"Stockton, CA",286,904,829,3.0,3/23/2007,"I am a huge Cheesecake Factory fan.  Let me rephrase that.  I am huge and happen to be a Cheesecake Factory fan. Our secretary at work even found something on the menu.  Fish and chips.    She doesn't eat a lick of vegetables and complains that she can't poop.  I tried to slip her a spinach salad a few months back and she about beat me with her keyboard.  This is not a joke.   The 'E' button is still missing from her keyboard.   We decided to order curbside service and everything went smoothly. The food was okay... you know what happens to food when you order take out... it's just not the same.  However, our portions were huge and everything was packaged nicely.   I ordered the crispy spicy beef.  It was a little tangier than what I'm used to but my rice was perfect.... fluffy, not too sticky.   The vegetables in my dish were cooked to perfection. So what's my beef?  Our meal did not include eating utensils.  WTF?   And after our secretary ate her platter of fried goodness, she complained for hours about her heartburn. hmmmmmm...... a mystery ensues."
Patrick A.,"San Francisco, CA",219,389,14,2.0,9/6/2007,Dennys fucked The Bellagio last spring break and gave birth the the Cheesecake Factory. It belongs in Pleasanton.  stupid.
MOna J.,"Palm Bay, FL",47,72,2,3.0,1/8/2009,"My boy friend and I went here for lunch the other day and the service was amazing the food...not so much. We had the Buffalo Blast appetizer... super crispy and yummy He ordered some chicken Caramel thing and it was really good I ordered the Cuban Sandwich It was disgusting...the roast pork was almost all fat it was slathered it mustard there was really nothing good about it.  I picked everything good out and was very content... Five minutes later our server walked by and asked if I didn't like It I told her no, but, I was okay with what I had and they she shouldn't stress about it...it really isn't her fault anyway just not what I'm used to... A few minutes later the manager came by and offered to remake or get me something else, i really had to convince these people that I wasn't that kind of needy! So I get my check and the totally didn't charge me for my food...the customer service was amazing... Honey really is better than vinegar..."
Luna R.,"San Ramon, CA",1,106,9,1.0,10/21/2012,"I've only done take out cause it is always way to busy for a sit down, Plus I'm only getting cheesecake. So the first time things went smooth I order a slice of cheesecake but thought it was too expensive, the second time I ordered a slice, when I got home the slice was very small but I live to far away to drive back,  so I called and asked for the manager and was told they come pre cut from the warehouse, no way could that happen, he gave me no solution, basically it was I don't believe you. On my third visit I called ahead of to order an 7in cheesecake, said it was for a party and needed it for 2pm. I also asked if I needed to do anything special, I was told no.. When I got there to pick up the cake, it was frozen! I was upset, because I needed it for a party at 2:30 they told me it would take a few hours. I told the cashier that I was unhappy because I had called ahead and I had asked if there was anything that I needed to do, so why had they not removed it from the freezer so it would be thawed by the time I came to pick it up, she said it wasn't her and like too bad for me.. well it got ugly, this little 19 year old talked to me like I was a peer opposed to a customer and forty years older... I will never ever buy anything from this location."
Jenifer V.,"McKinney, TX",195,355,39,3.0,9/28/2008,"$5 to valet park your car?  At the mall?  Really?  I just don't get that. I ran by last night around 8:15 to pick up a couple of pieces of cheesecake.  As typical for a Saturday night, it was mobbed.  People loitering outside.  People loitering inside.  All I want is some cheesecake!   One slice of low carb and one slice of 30 year anniversary chocolate cake cheesecake and I was in and out within 10 minutes and that included the walk to and from my car! I didn't eat during this visit, but I've been there before and I think it's pretty good.  Huge portions -- both regular food and cheesecake alike. I don't go there often, but it's nice for a treat every now and again."
Jennifer D.,"Sunnyvale, CA",83,182,22,3.0,7/8/2012,"Cheesecake Factory is a great place to go with a group because there is something for everyone!  Their menu is huge and their portions are just as big! We were seated pretty quickly, especially for Cheesecake Factory (within 15 minutes) and were quickly greeted by our waitress.  She brought out warm bread and butter, which we munched on while we waited to order.  I ordered the nachos with chicken off of the appetizer menu, while my boyfriend got the 4 cheese pasta with chicken.  The nachos were delicious with a good portion of chicken, guacamole, salsa, and sour cream.  I have to say this is one of the best dishes I've had from Cheesecake Factory.  The 4 cheese pasta was very cheesy with a lot of chicken and the sauce was ok.  We had to get some cheesecake because I mean look at where we were, so we got the Oreo cookie cheesecake.  This is a plane cheesecake with Oreos inside and an Oreo cookie crust.  The cheesecake was pretty good but kind of dry.  I have had the Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake and the Chocolate Raspberry Truffle Cheesecake, which are both much more delicious than the Oreo cheesecake.  The service was good and attentive and our waitress was very friendly.  The food was good but not amazing and the cheesecake for a place that is supposed to specialize in cheesecake was disappointing."
Sean K.,"Lodi, CA",49,76,5,2.0,1/24/2011,"I always enjoy the food. It's the service that makes one Cheesecake Factory different from the next. This one the service wasn't so good. Didn't dig the bartender at all. Wasn't helpful. He was cleaning some glasses and I asked him ""can I...."" he interrupted me and held up the number one finger and said ""I'll be there in a moment"" and continued cleaning his glasses.  Not good. Other examples but then I'd be getting nasty."
Bevy M.,"Castro Valley, CA",172,440,83,2.0,9/9/2007,"The people who run the hostess station are lying shite-pokes.   Every time I've tried to visit, they say ""15-20 minute wait.""  The first time, they kept us waiting for 75 minutes.  I would have left, but my daughter was really keen to try it, so we stayed.   The food is okay -- menu is vast, but seems repetitive.  The cheesecake slices are a lot smaller than I remember from my visits to other CF locations.  Service was very slow -- the entire meal took 2-1/2 hours, not including wait time.  The food I ordered was lukewarm, and they brought the wrong burger to my daugher and wouldn't fix it.  When I complained, they acted like it was our fault -- they should have comped us a dessert or something.  Humph!   Fast forward six months, I have forgotten the bad taste in my mouth from the previous visit, and my other daughter wants us to meet her here for lunch.  We get there at 11:20 so we can beat the noontime rush, and are told it'll be 10 minutes, but are kept waiting for 40 minutes for a table.  When we were finally seated, services was lackadaisical -- very unfocused.  I ordered the macaroni & cheese (it's on the appetizer section, and is usually quite yummy), and it was stone cold in the center.  WTF?!    I wouldn't mind this place if they would just either take reservations (and honor them), or be honest with time estimates.  Think of the criminal waste of time for so many hundreds of people every day.  We could all be using the time much more productively than cooling our heels in the inappropriately small waiting area.  Yes, they do give you a little buzzer/pager to tell you when to come get your table, but stupidly, these do not work in the mall.  Totally lame -- WTF?! I don't know why they didn't build a bigger restaurant with more tables -- seems like bad planning."
Alison T.,"Sunnyvale, CA",402,407,146,1.0,1/28/2007,"Okay, so I've been waiting for the day when Yelp will help me get the vindication I seek when a restaurant has wronged me, and guess what? THAT DAY HAS COME!!!!! Stoneridge Cheesecake Factory, YOU NEED TO STEP UP YOUR GAME! I will never go back to this CF again. Come to think of it, this location has ruined me for the rest of the CF establishments. We went here for my sister-in-law's birthday dinner and checked in at 5pm for 9 people and a newborn baby and we were told that the wait would be about 2 hours. First of all, they couldn't give us a pager because they were out of them, so they told us to come back for one. So we agreed and went to hang out in the mall ... and then returned to the restaurant. STILL NO PAGER, and now the wait time had gone up to 3 hours. WHAT?!? 3 hours? I've never even HEARD of a wait time that long. Every time that we went back to the front desk to inquire about the table they couldn't help us, reassure us, or even give us a couple of ice waters. And each person we spoke to gave us a hundred different answers and excuses. ""Ummm we always put our big parties at the top of the list so we don't forget them ... "" ""Oh, what was your party's name again?"" ""I'm sorry but this is the wait all the time ... 3 1/2 hours is normal"" ""Well, the wait is probably going to be another 15 minutes .... or 45 minutes at the maximum"" (Wow, you sure sound like you know the answer!) So we watched party after party file in and out, while we passed around the baby and tried to soothe our extremely empty stomachs. It ended up that baby ate looooooong before we did. We were finally seated at 8:40pm and ended our meal at 10:40pm! Are you kidding me? We were there for almost 6 hours. And it's just so sad that the food didn't appease us when we finally got seated. To make matters worse, they ended up charging us 10% tax on our bill and messed up the total, keeping us there even LONGER. I am appalled that no one tried to rectify any of the situation. I chalk it up to inexperience, poor planning, and a lack of meeting the customer's needs. And it's so ironic that the CF corporate website says ""Our floor plan allows us to easily seat large parties"" ... HA. Cheesecake Factory, you suck!"
Steve G.,"San Rafael, CA",121,73,1,2.0,2/3/2007,"Are you  all on crack? First of all, I wouldn't wait two hours to eat at a restaurant if Wolfgang Puck bought his ingredients from the farmer's market in Heaven and the dishes were being served by Charlize Theron.  Life is too short! I work across from Stoneridge Mall, so I had occasion to saunter over to check out the lunch scene at Cheesecake Factory.    It looked like I arrived shortly before a Yuppie refugee camp released it's detainees after offering up bologna sandwiches and tap water.  A bigger lunch mob, I haven't seen. First of all, I don't get the whole mystique about the restaurant equivalent of a super Wal-Mart.  When a menu is divided into chapters, I'm already assuming the quality of the dishes is going to suffer.  It's hard enough to do Tex-Mex, can you imagine having to put together Tex-Mex-Jap-Chin-Ital-Erican? As I only had two weeks vacation from work, I opted to sit outside, affording me a breathtaking view of - asphalt.  The landscapers for this restaurant must have previously worked for NASCAR. Okay, you want to know about the food?  It was -- big. Yes, very large.  I had an oriental salad (do they still use that word?) that was piled so high with rice noodles that it had an aircraft warning light perched on top.   It was fine,  but I'm on to the technique of using sweet and salty sauces to replace other, more complex seasonings.   The staff was pretty good, despite the complete cast of Braveheart that was populating the dining room.  My diet coke was refilled so many times I had to make two hikes to the restroom (very clean, thank you) while waiting for my check to be delivered.   What do you come to Cheesecake Factory for?  The cheesecake was ok.  Too cold and not creamy enough, though the wedge they gave me was big enough to be seen from outer space. If you have a couple of days to kill, feel free to make the trek."
Amy H.,"San Lorenzo, CA",43,75,41,2.0,1/1/2008,"Everytime we get our $70 check after a bad dinner at The Cheesecake Factory, the boyfriend and I ask ourselves, ""Why? Why did we do this to ourselves?""  The original plan is to eat some bread, an appetizer or two (namely the Ahi Tempura Roll) and a slice of tiramisu cheesecake and bounce. It almost NEVER happens that way. We somehow manage to convince ourselves that we each need to order an entree, which are all gross, by the way. We're then left with an unreasonably high bill (for having had crappy food), a takeout box for the tiramisu cheesecake we couldn't even finish, and a little bit of self-hatred for not choosing to go somewhere else. Note: Their cheesecakes are too sweet. I only like the tiramisu cheesecake and the Toblerone cheesecake, which they stopped selling for some reason. BOO."
Jojo N.,"Pleasanton, CA",736,430,188,4.0,12/22/2009,"Oh, vendors.. how they love to schmooze, LOL! One of my vendors took us here for lunch and I thouroughly enjoyed it! I wanted to save room for not one, but THREE cheesecakes since I couldn't make up my mind! For my meal, I only had an appetizer which was their ahi tuna tempura roll and it was really good! I was surprised how good it was for cheesecake factory! For dessert I got the banana cream, white chocolate raspberry, and the pineapple upside down cheesecakes! I know, I know.... I'm going to hell for gluttony! I took it home though and shared with the bf. He inhaled it in no time."
Eric N.,"San Jose, CA",51,76,9,2.0,12/19/2007,"""Dennys fucked The Bellagio last spring break and gave birth the the Cheesecake Factory. It belongs in Pleasanton.  stupid."" (reviewed by Patrick A.) ... lols That review is funny but true.  I don't get the 2 hour waiting to get a table at CF. Do people actually have a life? I mean don't they just realize that they are wasting of 2 hours of their life for an expensive version of Dennys. I came here last weekend with my coworkers for lunch. The food was mediocre. Service is good, attentive but can be annoying when the server came and checked up on you for every freaking 10 mins, and yet I didn't get a refill for my iced tea.  Portion is big for lunch, but then the price ain't small either. I rather they lower the price and serve a smaller portion. Expect to spend about 20 dollars for lunch here (drink, food + tax + tip). I personally don't like cheese cake either. So hopefully this would be my last time to visit this Sheeshcake Factory. Word!"
Sepoy S.,"San Francisco, CA",7,86,5,3.0,2/8/2011,"The service here is almost non existent after you place your order.  I had to flag down the busboy to fill our drinks, and order more food. The food was not bad, but the prices are atrocious.  Not too many choices for vegetarians, so we ordered a pasta dish, a mushroom burger, and a pizza.  Oh by the way, these guys can't substitute anything.  We asked for pesto sauce, which they didn't have, then asked for black olives, which they also don't have.  I'm surprised, since they serve pasta and pizza, those are very common ingredients.  Anyways, we asked for other common stuff too, but they don't carry that either. So...In conclusion, don't ask to make any changes to their menu, because they probably don't have it."
Michelle W.,"Daly City, CA",225,280,4,2.0,6/11/2007,"I tried this location and since it was located at the mall and it was the only one in the area... there were loads of people.  It was a freakin' zoo there on a Saturday at 5pm.  The wait wasn't long for a party of 2... but everything else took long... getting my bread (""it's on it's way""), getting my drinks (""sorry, it's coming""), getting my food (""the kitchen is backordered right now""), getting my to-go boxes, getting my check.  I literally sat at my table dehydrated for a good 10 minutes bc my drink didn't come yet. I sat outside, too, and I expected it to be breezy, but it also seems that they don't have enough umbrellas to block the sun for people.  It made my head really hot and I had to be wary of where my food was... one of my sweet corn tamale cakes kinda got spoiled. Food here is what it'll always be - huge portions and reliable.  But the service needs major improvement... it seems that there aren't enough servers to go around."
Isaiah N.,"San Luis Obispo, CA",46,359,22,4.0,12/22/2008,"On my latest experience, it was a hit...big time. Yeah, the wait was long (15 to 30 min.), but at least my party of two was seated...20 minutes later. That gave me time to decide what to eat, despite the crowds and the noise. This time around, I tried the Salisbury chopped steak (it was a special) and my mom tried the garlic noodles with chicken (lunch portion). The steak was great, but the noodles were a little oily. We were thinking of buying tiramisu again, but because the portions were so large (and we got bread too!), we decided not to order dessert. Overall, service is ok and food is great."
Guero M.,"Tracy, CA",6,20,,3.0,5/9/2010,"Average. Food was good, the wait for a table was long. Service was pretty good. But all in all nothing special and a little pricy for what it is."
