mark z.,"Castro Valley, CA",2,37,,4.0,7/30/2012,"I took a friend named Diane to this restaurant on her birthday as she said she had never had ""Steak Diane"" and wanted to try it. We went around noon on a Saturday. The place was packed-young, middle aged on up. I expected to wait a bit to be seated but we were shown to a booth right away. (They also have plenty of tables and there's an option to sit outside). Very attentive server, incredibly large menu. Food was very good. I had the salmon with mashed potatoes and green beans and a small Greek salad to begin with. Diane enjoyed her steak and had so much food she took some home with her. What amazed us was with the huge crowd on hand, everything seemed to be running like a well oiled machine. The kitchen had to be crazy/ mad busy. While we were there, a group of servers started to sing ""Happy Birthday"" and she gave me a look like ""I hope that's NOT for me!"" (""If looks could kill""). She leans on the shy side and doesn't like attention. Turns out they went to a table a few away from our booth. I had considered calling ahead and surprising her with something like that but I wanted to live another day. Definitely plan to go back. A very good vibe from the crowd."
Aivy C.,"Fremont, CA",301,1030,18,4.0,9/17/2007,"SUPER long-ass wait, but at least the food was served to us rather quickly after ordering, and our server gets a high-five for being completely on point, even when we asked him halfway through our meal to split the bill amongst five people, because he was totally hung over and didn't make a single mistake! I had the pasta bolognese with white truffle oil (the truffle oil adds about $3) but I probably wouldn't have known the difference had I simply not added it on. Most of all, I love how this place has a nice outdoor seating area facing a parking lot and a lot of already noisy foot traffic - my college friends and I can be a bit raucous, and it's always nice to be able to have dinner in an environment where we can be ourselves, laugh it up and just have a good time, even more so when everyone else around us is doing the same and couldn't care less. It's hilarious how some people think they're the only people on earth entitled to ever be loud and obnoxious during a meal. Live and let live, man. And of course, the cheesecake is FAB!"
Alani N.,"Elk Grove, CA",50,71,98,3.0,11/18/2010,First time here- super busy but of course it is a Saturday night! My stuffed chicken tortillas were okay- I've had them at other Cheesecake Factory's and they've been much tastier. Service was good though- very attentive.  I just hate when a party of two gets squished next to a large party at the half bench seat and one real seat table!
Beau R.,"Sammamish, WA",151,326,29,2.0,2/25/2007,"I met some of my sister-in-laws for dinner here with their families.  The best part of the evening was their company. The Cheesecake Factory appears to be a part of a renovation/expansion of the Stoneridge Mall.  There is a new PF Changs and evidently Sears is giving way to a movie theater, but I digress. It was a Tuesday night and we had to wait at least 30 minutes for a table.  Huh, such a wait on a Tuesday night?  Come on?  How many kids from Pleasanton are going on a date or staying late at the mall? After a while, we were seated and got our really thick menus.  Now, the Cheesecake Factory is known for a few things, varied selection, huge portions, a robust dessert menu and huge portions.  I don't think I'd ever seen a menu this thick before - but every other page had ads on it.  I was interested in dinner, not a real estate agent, shoes or vacations! I ordered the Cuban Sandwich, because I make something similar at home.  I was hoping that a professional would make a better sandwich than I.  My hope was misplaced. One of the people in my party ordered the sandwich special: a half sandwich, a cup of soup and a salad.  It came with a full sandwhich and a cup that was as large as a bowl.  It was a good deal, costwise, but she was trying to order small portions (in a restaurant known for huge portions). I wasn't into dessert that night (surprisingly) as I had started to crash.  Dessert was shared at my table and some even doggie bagged home. Which takes me to the Styrofoam boxes they used to put left overs in.  No, I'm not some kind of environmentalist, so this isn't a rant about Styrofoam.  The boxes were about the size of a hot dog you get at a ball park.  Huge portions does not equate to small boxes.  I don't get it. All in all, dinner with friends and family was nice.  The fact that Stoneridge is getting a facelift is nice too.  Cheesecake Factory, meh."
Linda C.,"San Leandro, CA",144,441,1,3.0,3/23/2007,"Three! Good ol' Cheesecake factory -- reliable, huge portions (almost too much), good cheesecake (please, please try the 5 Carb Low Sugar cheesecake, so good I can't even tell the difference!)!  However, at this location it just seems to be busy ALL the time, even on a tuesday, wednesday, thursday, etc. etc.  I've ate here numerous times and have never really been disappointed.  I love the firecracker salmon rolls and also the calamari is good (but I love calamari, so maybe I'm partial...)... the strawberry pound cake dessert thing is also super yum, and I'm always a fan of the salmon salad... However, eating here too much has really made me feel like this has turned into my neighboorhood denny's... weird.... but i would come here again - just spaced out more between visits! :D hahaha (better than the PF Changs across the way)!"
Cynthia W.,"San Francisco, CA",304,269,150,4.0,1/5/2008,+Reservations = No waiting :) +Huge menu of delicious food = hard to make a bad decision +Great interior decor! +Huge Huge Platters of Delicious Food!
Amy T.,"Dublin, CA",292,395,153,5.0,6/29/2007,"What can I say, I love this place and I love even more that I don't have to travel great distances to eat here anymore.  Now that I've cut out the distance, I just wait great lengths to eat here (average wait when we've gone for dinner during the week is 25-40 minutes, you can usually cut your wait down a few minutes if you ask for first available seating - on the weekends expect to wait at least an hour during peak eating hours).   We were so excited about Cheesecake Factory coming to Pleasanton that we made a point of eating here on opening night.  While smaller than any of the other Cheesecake Factories we have been to, it is still a good size.   Favorite appetizer is the Firecracker Salmon Rolls served on a bed of red cabbage slaw with a spicy and zesty Asian dressing.  The cabbage slaw is delicious and I sometimes wonder if I enjoy that more than the salmon rolls, but probably not.  The salmon rolls are deep fried in lumpia wrapper and also have the dressing drizzled on them.   They serve unsweetened and sweetened versions of tropical iced tea (my favorite) and they now also have green tea!  I need to try it. Their bread basket is also delicious and it takes conscious effort on my part not to fill up on it before the other gargantuan plates of food come to the table.  Sharing a main dish with another person is entirely possible and highly recommended if you can agree on a dish with the person you are dining with.   I love their Hungarian Goulash and their Shepherd's Pie.  I usually end up eating less than half of it and taking the rest home - the portions are GINORMOUS. I also enjoy getting their crab cake sandwich served on a freshly baked brioche bun with consistently crisp french fries.  This crab cake really does have lots of crab in it and it is DEEEEEELISH! And of course, the cheesecake.  Always need to make room for the cheesecake.  We love it so much, if we just absolutely can't eat another bite, we get a slice to go and eat it later or save it for the next day.  The majority of their chocolate-y, caramel, coffee types of cheesecakes are REALLY rich and sweet and I usually stick to the more 'virgin' ones that just have fruit on them or something.  However, on the last visit, I tried their traditional Oreo cheesecake with a chocolate cookie crust and it was wonderful!!   They also make great mixed drinks!!  Tropical smoothies, daiquiris, etc.  The best seats are the booths, but they have semi-cramped table seating and bar seating (where you can watch sports) and outdoor seating which is great when the weather is cooperating. Also, I have yet to have a bad service experience at any of the Cheesecake Factory restaurants - I am extremely impressed with how good the service is at such a crowded, busy and large restaurant. And if you're looking for an intimate, quiet meal, this is not the place to go.  It gets pretty darn loud inside - outside is better, but I would not call it intimate by any means.  This is a great place to have a party (if you don't mind waiting for a table, because they don't take reservations)!!!"
Justin M.,"Castro Valley, CA",33,137,5,3.0,5/9/2007,"Valet parking for the Cheesecake Factory at the shopping mall?  There's plenty of parking!  You're at a friggin shopping mall!  I could understand valet parking at a nice restaurant, but for a restaurant chain at a shopping mall?  I guess if you're a baller, or too lazy to walk...use the valet.  Pretty soon valet parking for McDonald's. Cheesecake Factory has great selection of food from burgers, steaks, pasta, salads, their specialties, and many more.  I can never decide on what I want to eat.  Super generous portions.  I recommend sharing. Expect to wait.  Service can be bad when it's busy.  Wait...it's always busy here. Love the location and it beats driving to downtown SF."
Michelle W.,"Brentwood, CA",167,351,41,4.0,9/14/2010,Had a baby shower for one of my friends there.  We called and they told us that we needed to come in 3 hours before we plan on coming in.  Someone checked in and when it was time everyone else showed up.  The waiter was great.  It took a very long time to get the check and to have everyone pay though.
Jing Si Z.,"San Francisco, CA",47,10,11,5.0,3/11/2014,"cheesecake always good everybody know that, but the best thing i like it is they are the service i was order the lime key cheese cake but the testy it was i expect. then when the serve came to me ask how m i like the cake, i told what m i felt. after that he help me change the new one....  so, i was say they are the good is good, but the service id the best!"
Alie C.,"Santa Clara, CA",576,683,14,2.0,10/18/2009,"Wow. This was a memorable experience and definitely not in a good way. We sat in the bar area because it was open seating and we didn't want to wait. This may have been our first mistake. Our waitress, a teeny Asian lady who didn't speak very good English, came to great us after waiting like 10 minutes. We then ordered our drinks that took GASP another 10 minutes and then she walked away for another 5 even though we were ready to order. When we had a question about the menu she could hardly answer it. Our food ended up taking like 30 minutes and by then we were furious. We had to ask the ladies who brought us our meal to get us refills. By then we were so angry that the food didn't taste as good as it could have. The experience was bad enough that I wouldn't give the restaurant another chance."
Jennifer H.,"Portland, OR",112,18,,1.0,7/27/2007,"Meh.  There were way too many people, slow as fuck service, and despite everyone elses portions being humongous, the size was lacking as well as the flavor. The asparagus was terrible, and the chicken I ate was worse than shit I make at home. No thank you."
Stella C.,Hong Kong,293,659,271,3.0,4/26/2007,"I LOVE you cheesecake factory, your food is consistent and i am unable to rid myself of the cajun jambalaya pasta addiction. but why must the wait for you at every location be so ridiculous? sometimes i am unreasonably hungry and yet you make me wait 3 hours... three hours!"
Tess W.,"Dublin, CA",4,31,,5.0,3/17/2008,"I've always enjoyed my time here and am so glad they decided to open this location--I always hated the 2 hour waits in SF.  Don't get me wrong, the wait is pretty long here too but not as bad imo. Try to go here during the weekdays. The food is always up to my expectations and I have never had a complaint with what I order. Service has been great as well. I am always gonna come back for more!"
Patrick S.,"San Francisco, CA",108,783,30,2.0,2/22/2008,"If you love this place, stop reading I have nothing for you.  Been twice, against my will and better judgement.  Experienced annoying issues with reservations, waits, staff, and service.  Food was OK, but just OK and with what I would call seriously lowered expectations.  Did not try the cheesecake, so perhaps I missed something special there.  I do like the decor and enjoyed a drink at the bar during one of the waits.  PF Chang's cartoon version of Chinese food is better on the food front in my humble opinion."
Bruce C.,"Lincoln County, OR",264,45,16,5.0,1/8/2011,The Memphis Burger is Great! Try the Reese's Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake Cheesecake too!
Todd S.,"Hayward, CA",0,5,3,5.0,3/2/2011,"My wife and I have been coming here every weekend for awhile. The food is excellent, we both love the lunch pizza's. The jambalaya is awesome also. We've been to many c.c. factories and this one is like all the others----- you have to wait for good food and service. I recommend go for lunch and get there when they open."
Juan L.,"San Ramon, CA",223,58,16,4.0,11/22/2009,"This place is busy most of the time but the food is always consistent. You cant go wrong with the Avocado rolls as a starter. If you are in the mood for pasta I would suggest Spicy chicken chipotle, or pasta da vinci."
Rachel M.,"Fremont, CA",16,19,2,5.0,11/18/2010,Everything I have tried at the Cheesecake factory has been good. They have so many choices on the menu which makes it easy for my whole family to get what they want. The red velvet cheesecake is delicious and one of the main reasons I go. The second reason we go is for the excellent customer service. The only problem I have ever had at this restaurant would be the wait but what good restaurant doesn't have a line especially on a Friday??? Definitely worth waiting :)
Jenn H.,"Alameda, CA",108,84,7,4.0,8/14/2010,"Days here can be a hit or miss. While the servers are good most of the time- they sometimes do press you if you want a cheesecake and due to my time constraints and constant competition schedule- no. (but I ate the red velvet the day before champs) food is great. That's why I come anyway. Thai chicken... Not so good. Chicken Diane and Pasta Di Vinci- great! But portions are big!!! So sometimes take it out to go and microwave and voilà! Dinner! Pretty pricey unless you bring some home to dinner. (2 meals for the price of one and calories saved!) not the best place for those on a diet! For lunch portions I do the same as well. Take a bit, eat a bit there and go, and that saves room for dessert.  Service is the hit or miss. Waiting can suck and service slow. So I had to carry out a lot. Bartenders are awesome though. Always able to talk to them. And since I'm under 21- they are good with making me my virgin cocktails (I had a V.Mai Tai, V. Typhoon Breese, V.... well let's just say I had a lot of drinks- this ain't Australia where the 18 year olds can drink...) My Faves: Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake- Yum... chocy... Red Velvet- and cheesecake= love Normal- can't go bad with the classics Chicken Diana- Yum- default dish! Pasta Da Vinci- What I usually eat before competition, it's good too. Chicken Picata- My old default"
