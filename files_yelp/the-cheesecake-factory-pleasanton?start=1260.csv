Chris K.,"Livermore, CA",218,1178,230,4.0,9/16/2007,"Haven't had a bad meal here yet!  The service is always excellent, and of course there's the yummy cheeesecake!  Go  early on a weeknight or right when it opens on a weekend and you'll never wait for a table.  Do not order an entree if you plan on having a dessert though, the portions here are crazy huge!!! Update...had to change my rating after trying the Cobb Salad here...it was truly nasty!!!  The greens were limp and the chicken wasn't very fresh.  Hopefully this doesn't mean it's going downhill!"
Shannon K.,"Oakland, CA",16,54,97,2.0,2/18/2007,"Two stars is generous and it's only because the food was pretty good -- the food food was good, the cheesecake was just okay.  I went for a girl's night out with 4 friends, we got there early to avoid the 90 minute wait.   The service was the biggest problem here.  It took about 20 minutes for our first round of drinks so we figured we should order round 2 when she brought round 1.  Not even half way through round 2, our food comes out.  Now, we were there to have a good time.  Our waitress had the opportunity to make a pretty good tip from us, but we were basically ignored.  She never asked if we wanted more drinks and we had to ask for dessert when she brought out the bill.   We spent the whole time waiting for service, for drinks, for food that shouldn't've taken so long.  If the bar and kitchen and wait staff got it together to actually serve people in a timely fashion there wouldn't be a 90 minute wait.  Yeah, the decor is all new and shiny, but both me & another friend in heels almost slipped a couple times making it to the bathroom across the restaurant.  Hmmm...maybe if we had slipped we would've gotten better service. Ah, and I can't forget the nice little surprise one of us got on the bill that her 2 ""Ritz"" drinks cost $12 a piece!  And, no, she wasn't even a bit tipsy.  Boo!"
Noah C.,"Omaha, NE",26,103,5,3.0,8/20/2007,"usually we try to avoid these novelty/chain kind of restaurants (fridays, applebees, etc.) but kel was curious to give it a go. ENORMOUS menu.  so large, in fact, it was difficult to focus on the task at hand.    we settled on splitting a chopped salad (delicious!) and ordered lunch-sized portions of pasta dishes.  even though these were lunch-sized portions, they were very large.  we each only ate half of our plates.)  all in all, the food was decent, though since lunch was over $40, don't think it's quite worth it. on the upside, we loved our server.  after we ordered stella, just before 1130a, mind you, she didn't even bat an eyelash.  in fact, she encouraged kel when he ordered the larger of the two options.  she was charming, friendly and efficient. not sure if we'll return or not ... maybe if pressed, we'd go for a slice of cheesecake and coffee.  or an early stella artois.  :)"
Lady M.,"Oakland, CA",0,8,3,1.0,4/11/2013,"I came here last night and the food was greasy and tasteless; the only food item that was good was the baffalo wings, I was shocked that the food tasted bad because I been going there for the past 7 years and never experienced the food being that bad. I order the chicken bites instead of it having flavor it tasted like straight frying oil with no season."
Ethel-Lynn Q.,"Pleasanton, CA",536,181,64,4.0,3/1/2010,This is my second time there but I only decided to right a review since I was just there this past weekend.  Our server was nice.  The food was fine.  My drink was a little watered down but I wasn't looking to get drunk so maybe it was a blessing. I can't say I'm a regular there but nothing went wrong that day!  I like the grilled cheese.  The spinach dip was ok but could use a little more taste but they were very kind with the amount of chips.  I didn't order the cheesecake although I know that is what they are famous for...I'm famous for not gaining weight!
Lily L.,"San Leandro, CA",147,48,251,4.0,7/25/2008,"Dined: 2008-05-17 I love Cheesecake Factory. I used to eat cheesecakes a lot when I was younger - regular cheesecakes with the occasional treat of cherries or other berries on top. I ate them so often that I actually got sick of my cheese-tastic friend. Then came along Cheesecake Factory. Of course they cheat, putting all kinds of stuff on their cheesecakes. The question is: Am I really enjoying the cheesecake or all the goodies they put in, on, over, etc their cheesecakes? Hmm... After a day of dress shopping, my girlfriends and I went here to treat ourselves for dinner. It was my first time dining at this location. We had about a 20-40 minute wait (we were really pushing more towards the 20-minute mark).  One of my friends was really hungry and ordered a cheesecake from the counter to eat. All 4 of us shared the vanilla bean cheesecake. Yum! We got seated closer to the 20-minute mark... yay! One problem with the Cheesecake Factory is that there are so many choices on the menu. Choices are always good, except when you are indecisive and so hungry you could eat everything on the menu. For an appetizer, we had the fried mac and cheese. Not as good as I was hoping. It tasted more like mush with sauce. I could not taste the cheese and the marinara sauce did not help. I was good and ordered a pear and endive salad - it was good. I could never give a good-for-you salad a rave review. As long as it is fresh and the contents go well together (and it truly is good for you), that is all I am asking for. Any salad that is really good is probably not good for you. I did not finish the whole thing... because I saved room for dessert! Yeah, I know, we started with dessert, but we had to end with it too. And that's why I was so good with my entree! haha My girlfriends wussed out one me however and said they were too full for dessert and would 'try' whatever I got. And I wanted to try something other than cheesecake. *gasp* Ordering dessert at the Cheesecake Factory that isn't cheesecake?!? Can you do that? Of course you can. The have plenty of choices with the cheesecake menu AND dessert menu.  They are evil geniuses I tell ya. And as I told a friend once, you can judge a restaurant by its dessert. =P Anyway, I saw what I wanted in the glass display case while we were waiting for our table. The lemoncello cream torte. I have only heard of lemoncello recently watching one of my faves Giada De Laurentiis on Food Network. It looked so yummy I had to try it! And it was good! It was like a strawberry shortcake with a lemon twist. Note to self: when at the farmer's market gathering ingredients for strawberry shortcake, remember the lemons. haha Maybe it was a good thing my friends were too full to share. =D"
Lillian A.,"Oakland, CA",369,6,2,4.0,11/27/2010,"Yea the stockings came off..Okay where should we begin..I had never been here and the whole thought of MALL kinda scared me off..But I being a team player decided to give it a chance. I had my hubby order me a pre din din cocktail..I don't recall the actual name but I know it included the two following ingredients Jack Daniel's and Raspberry liqueur's had the Diane special meat, potatoes, and scallops and salmon..the meal was deli sh but we both agreed that the servings of the mash potatoes was a little over board..we closed the meal with a ridiculous dessert that was just sinful pre taking of the stockings mind you..resses peanut butter cheeses cake..yummm....will mos def be back for seconds..si nos gusta..."
Angela H.,"Daly City, CA",119,497,,3.0,11/8/2007,"The good thing about Cheesecake Factory is that it has a gigantic menu full of everything you could possibly want- from sandwiches, to pizzas, to pasta, and of course, cheesecake.  To avoid the long lines, I'd suggest coming at weekday lunch because the crowds are much thinner.  It also helps because they offer a lunch menu where you can get regular items in a smaller portion for a smaller price.   I had one of their pastas- I can't remember the name right now, but it was rigatoni with chunks of chicken, onions, and mushrooms in a creamy madeira sauce.  Delicious and I'm sure very fattening, but the portion was huge!  As hungry as I was, I only finished half of it, so I'm scared to see what the regular portion would have looked like.  They also give you a bread basket with a dark, seeded wheat bread and some slices of French baguette.  The baguette was nice and crusty and the wheat bread was fairly good. Overall, a nice place to eat, especially if you're outside and you can soak up some sun.  Yes, you'll hear suburban housewives talk about their lives endlessly, but if you can tune them out, enjoy the weather and your food, and you've got yourself a good lunch."
Jonathan M.,"San Francisco, CA",160,55,18,1.0,10/11/2009,"This had to be the WORST Cheesecake Factory ever. Me and my girlfriend decided to take a trip out to Livermore today to try the GM Farms corn maze. We had a great time and spent an hour and 45 minutes. We had a great time, but were hungry from the maze. We quickly got on to yelp and looked for something to eat. We found the Cheesecake Factory was close and we unsure what we wanted so we decided to go with something safe. We arrived here and parking was a bit difficult to find at first and I'm from the city where parking is nonexistent. Anyways we arrive and were seated within 5mins. Our server was friendly and such and nothing wrong with the service. We both decided to order pasta dishes. I ordered the chicken and tomato pasta dish. It was average but needed more chicken and pasta as the dish was half tomatoes. But whatever I was hungry. My girlfriend ordered the DA vinci pasta dish. It had the most nasty sauce I have ever tasted. Now I know Cheesecake Factory is not suppose to be amazing, but every time I have gone to the SF one or other ones the food has always been good, not amazing. But the food here was just bad. I believe most of the families eat here lack taste buds if they think these Cheesecake Factory food is good. Now where are experience went bad. PARENTS you need to teach your kids some fucking manners. The family next us had two children who did not listen. The 9 year old boy kept running around between our tables and would not sit down. He kept taking his grandmothers iphone and shaking it around. He then kept jumping on the booth where my girlfriend was sitting, and started kicking his feet. My girlfriend told me shes about to get kicked. Next minute yup the boy kicked my girlfriend and then ran and jumped on his side of the booth over his grandmother. I was pissed and gave the boy the stare and his parents still didn't do anything, but tell him to stop or they will take him outside and give him a time out. I made my voice clear when I said parents need to teach their kids some discipline and should not take him if they wild. Now my mother would have never let me done what he did she would have smacked and told me to stop. ""Not I will give you time out"". To all the parents out there grow a pair and start disciplining your children."
Vera D.,"Queen Creek, AZ",153,72,86,3.0,3/1/2007,"Do you like Cheese Cake??? Well, you'll like this Cheese Cake, because it is a place where much more is served than Cheese Cake.  I've been to 3 different locations of Cheesecake Factory, Chicago, Fresno, Ca, and Pleasanton, Ca.  You need to get there early at any location, at least 1 hour before you want to eat, and on the weekend maybe 1 1/2 hours before you get hungry. This is a dining experience that you can share with anyone for any occasion!  Bring the little ones and bring your grandparents, everyone will enjoy it!  The atmosphere is buzzing with plates clattering, people chattering and children laughing.  The menu is humongous, so much to choose from, it seemed a bit overwhelming for me.  But there is something for everyone to choose from.  Beware that the salads, even their lunch salads are HUGE!  But the taste is so very worth it and you can always use a to go box to take home the leftovers. The servers are all so very personable, ask for Chris in Pleasanton, he meets all your needs and makes sure you are taken care of.  He deserves the employee of the month. BTW if my memory serves me correctly it's his birthday in March and he turns 21!  That is how great the servers are because you can remember them so vividly.  That says alot!   Well, it's time to make that reservation, pick up the phone and call the closest Cheesecake Factory to make your dining experience complete!"
Jen E.,"Fremont, CA",6,117,,3.0,11/29/2007,"I still don't get it...  When CF opened up a couple years ago at the Macy's in SF, my SoCal friends were talking like it was the Second Coming.  I couldn't justify a trip to SF to go to a Cheesecake Factory, so I skipped it until the one opened up in Pleasanton.   You would think that these people had never been out to dinner before - 90 minutes for two people???  People in line in front of me at the hostess stand were being told 2 1/2 hours for a party of 5 or 6 - and they greedily took their pager and went off to do whatever it is you do when you have to wait over two hours before you can eat... I was meeting a girlfriend here so I deferred the pager to the next desperate person in line behind me and went to the bar.  I was able to find a seat fairly quickly, and thank God they let you eat at the bar.   Although surprisingly, most people there were waiting for a table (??). Drinks were good - nothing to write home about but the bartenders were definitely friendly, quick and capable, esp. given how slammed they were.  We had some appetizers, sliders and some crab wonton things.  The sliders were good, wonton things, eh.   All in all, if there was a short wait, I'd come back, but this is nothing to waste two hours of your life waiting for.   Also, too many greasy guys with muscles and jewelry at the bar.  Blech."
Tami A.,"Oakland, CA",18,13,9,2.0,1/27/2007,"I had a looong review posted here about TCF, but I just deleted it.  Frankly, it's not worth it.  I was all heated up about trying this chain a few years ago when I saw it some food-related show.  When I finally tried it out, the cheesy but fun decor and friendly service definitely got points.  But, here it is:  everything I've had here is way too sweet (and I'm not talkin' dessert) and/or deep-fried or somehow made way rich.  They seem to use pretty decent, fresh ingredients, but then they wreck them with too much fat and sugar.  And, hey! I LIKE fat and sugar.   All that being said, if you are hungry and stuck in Pleasanton after 10pm, well, this may be the best you can do..."
Angie K.,"Dublin, CA",25,11,,4.0,6/1/2011,"We visited our local Cheesecake Factory on a Sunday and the wait was  long but thats no surprise. 15 minutes turned into an hour as usual! we had the most amazing waiter and awesome food to make up for every minute of waiting. Our toddler got his complimentary bread and banana plate as well which is why I love this place for kid friendliness. Now if they could have told us the right wait time, it would have been a 5 star experience."
Jada B.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",16,105,86,2.0,1/2/2008,"My boyfriends mother liked the Frisco location while she was visiting last so we decided to give Pleasanton a try-we didn't have to deal with crossing a bridge or sitting out in the freezing cold on a balcony with the seagulls. My just ok experiences at the Union Square location was 5 times better than this. We came at a time when it wasn't crowded, we could see empty tables and we still waited 15-20 minutes. And why do all of them have waiting areas the size of a closet?  The Cheesecake Factory attitude that is typical of their employees was even worse cuz this was Pleasanton. Our waitress wasn't very attentive, she took forever to do anything, refilled our drinks once and we were there over an hour, our food took forever to come out and she disappeared when we asked for the check. The food was just sub par.  I had the Bistro Shrimp pasta, which has the shrimp in a light batter type coating and it was soggy and lukewarm, My boyfriends entree had wasabi mashed potatoes, but we never tasted any wasabi. My bf's mom had the chicken marsala, which was the only good meal. We were so disappointed we left without any cheesecake. I increasingly get disappointed with the Cheesecake Factory (and reading other reviews I am not the only one) and for what they charge I don't think I will be going back unless someone we know absolutely has to."
Alvin W.,"Fremont, CA",221,328,87,4.0,6/21/2008,"I'm giving Cheesecake Factory 4 stars for my last visit.  I went for lunch on Tuesday and as usual they were packed with customers.  My server was excellent and was probably the best service we'd ever experienced at this location.  I ordered the fettucine with chicken and sun dried tomatoes.  I was kinda disappointed when I saw my dish, but when I tasted it, I enjoyed it. I was pretty full from my meal, but wanted a slice of cheesecake.  You can't go to cheesecake factory and not get a cheesecake, even it it's to go.  They have a new flavor, pistachio.  Pistachio flavored cheesecake with pistachio choclate crust.  It was very good and is probably one of my new favorites."
Stephanie M.,"Pleasanton, CA",32,81,17,5.0,2/1/2010,"Just hosted my daughters birthday here.  16 guests who thankfully all arrived on time.  We were seated without a problem, we had 2 waiters (who were both awesome) and all the food came out hot, without any errors !! That's saying a lot.  We brought in our own cake, and shared with our waiters too... hehe.  All in all, it was a great dinner, with great friends, and family, and great service.  We could not have been happier."
Sameera M.,"Hercules, CA",13,18,16,5.0,8/8/2010,I came here with my friend I enjoyed my self. Actually they have better customer service here then the one in s.f. I liked the food and cheese cakes of course!! I would come to this one has good and fast friendly service...
Karsyn M.,"Pleasanton, CA",85,102,9,2.0,4/9/2012,"I will never understand all the hype with this place.  I think it's just trendy right now and that's why people will wait in line for 45 minutes for a table.  The food is incredibly overpriced, but not that spectacular.  I mean it's all right, but I've never left and thought, WOW!  The thing I most recently noticed that was really disappointing was their prices on their wine selection.  Now, don't get me wrong, I understand that they have to make money, and there is going to be some mark-up, but the by-the-glass price was what an entire bottle costs!!  I realized this as I had recently purchased some of the bottles that they had listed.  Seriously, come on!  So ridiculous.  Super irritating!!!  I still ordered a glass, but it was a bummer knowing that I had a whole bottle at home for the same price.  Service there is never that great either, but I guess that can be expected since they are always so busy.  I also don't love that they cram as many tables as possible in there.  I always feel like I'm sharing my table with the strangers next to me.  I have no idea why I have been here as many times as I have!"
Tammy V.,"San Lorenzo, CA",34,33,1,3.0,5/5/2011,"My husband and I enjoy the Sunday brunch menu the best!! You can't beat the French Toast Napoleon. However, the regular menu has too many choices, and many are just so-so. They look more impressive than they taste. The restaurant tends to be crowded, and you rarely are lucky enough to get a prive table. Most tables are just inches away from the next table."
JoAnn V.,"Dublin, CA",67,169,,4.0,3/19/2007,This has got to be the smallest Cheesecake Factories around... Who came up with the design plan for this new location? It's always crowded... and it's attached to a mall... did I mention it's always crowded? 4 stars for visiting any other time besides lunch or dinner... 3 stars for the rest of the day. but 1/2 a star for the best cheesecake: the caramel apple streusel... :)
