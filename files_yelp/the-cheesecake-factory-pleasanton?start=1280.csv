Brenda H.,"Fremont, CA",45,543,13,3.0,11/14/2007,"I typically don't like too many of the dishes at Cheesecake Factory.  They offer so many options on the menu, it actually is very overwhelming.  But they do have some guarantee yummy dishes:   - corn cakes appetizer  - avocado egg rolls  - eggs benedict w/salmon (during Sunday brunch)  - any cheesecake flavor  - strawberry shortcake But during my visit here, it was the friendly staff and service that blew me away.  I would totally come back here, even though the food was 'ok'.  Great atmosphere and generally a good location where everyone can find something to order."
Cherry A.,"Dublin, CA",0,11,,4.0,4/30/2011,Consistently good food and service. I like dining at the bar! They have a pretty decent happy hour..
J A.,"Walnut Creek, CA",12,9,,2.0,9/14/2009,"So how do you lose a credit card from our table to the cash register??? Cheesecake did! They lost my credit card. I couldnt believe it! The service was horrible! They take forever to serve you and when they didnt bring my card back I had to ask them where it was, which at this time they decided to tell me. The waiter insisted he had told two managers about the situation but when another manager came over he had no idea about it! Seriously, with that many manager working at one time, things should go a little smoother. And the manager continued to joke about it. This was the bill for my drinks at the bar which this manager later tried to make me pay?!! He did end up comping my meal and those drinks but still I was very disapointed and it was a great inconvenience to cancel my card and wait for another to arrive!"
Lori L.,"Alameda, CA",82,213,37,4.0,6/27/2010,"the wait here is usually super long, so we sit either in the bar area or on the patio outside (which is what we did this time).  the food was great. i had the tuna takaki salad. slightly seared tuna sashimi with spicy seasoning served next to a spring salad. i'm usually not a fan of spring salad, but this one was quite tasty! we also ordered the kaluha cheesecake which was REAL good. i think it was a coffee cheesecake with kaluha on top of a brownie crust with plenty of whipped cream...YUM! we barely saw our waiter though. when we did, he refilled our water, which was good, but other than that, we wouldn't see him for at least 15 minutes at a time."
Chris R.,"Honolulu, HI",19,1057,81,2.0,1/12/2010,"Compare to the location in SF, this place is not up to par.  I've experienced better tasting food and faster service at other location."
Esther C.,"San Jose, CA",40,79,,3.0,6/1/2007,"I have never really understood why the Cheesecake Factory been talked so highly about. I've visited a few around the Bay Area and all have been fairly mediocre visits.  Yesterday I had a late dinner (up'd star because it opens late) with one of my best friends who actually was in a wheel chair due to a recent accident. Anyways, I believe the staff at CF knew she was in a wheel chair but still gave us a table that wasnt a booth but was a little table which was super close to our neighbors. They didn't offer any other seating arrangement so we just took it. Anyways, I dont think they were that accomadating to people in wheel chairs.  The menu had great variety but I really don't like how they advertised for other stores in them. I find that very tacky.  Food was good and came out in a timely order. We ordered the Salmon Rolls and the Luau Salad. The service was mediocre and impersonal. I don't even remember the server's name. If the service was mediocre for a party of two, I can't imagine how it would be with a large party."
Catherine S.,"Walnut Creek, CA",26,48,1,3.0,1/24/2007,"You can't go wrong with cheesecake, so many delicious varieties.  We didn't eat dinner, we just came in for dessert. I have eaten at the S.F. Cheesecake Factory and the food is not worth it but the desserts are heavenly. It makes you forget that you waited too long for a table."
Natalie B.,"Alameda, CA",153,25,1,4.0,7/11/2012,"the chocolate coconut cheesecake was enough to put this place over the top! it was HEAVENLY!!! ok now with that out, to the rest of the review! lol! my friend and i went on a friday night so it was understandably super crowded.. there was a half hour wait so we walked around the mall for awhile. i found it weird that the pager things wouldn't work in the mall, but whatever they probably don't want to have to wait for people that are hella far away. anyways, when we got there it was sunny and warm so we said we didn't care if we were in our outside. when we came back from our mall excursion we were seated on the patio. luckily we were too busy catching up and being silly, because we waited and waited for our food.. it was getting colder and colder.. finally the manager came out and said they had messed our order up somehow so they moved us inside because the sun was going down and the fog was rolling in. she picked up everything from our table and moved us inside where it was nice and warm. then we got a new server and our food came minutes later. the sandwich was OK, i got a chicken club and it was a huge hunk of chicken and not much else.. the fries were the bomb and so was my raspberry lemonade (they even rimmed the glass with sugar!). halfway through our meal we got a new server cuz the other one went on break..kinda silly that we had 3 servers but i understand we got moved and then people need breaks.. i just hope they split the tip fairly! anyways, i was too full to order cheesecake but my friend insisted that since we were at the cheesecake factory i had to order some.. so i did and it was SO AMAZING. i ate the whole slice and most of the delicious whipped cream! oh my god i have never been so full in my whole life but i couldn't stop eating it!! lol! i will definitely have to get a slice of that every time i go to stoneridge now!"
Lynn M.,"Tracy, CA",1,19,,2.0,4/11/2013,"I have come to this restaurant several times. I enjoy the food, but the service is inconsistent. Our last visit wasn't the greatest with the service, it took awhile to get our drinks and even the initial greeting was very delayed. I love the food, but would recommend some training with some of the wait staff."
Jennifer G.,"Berkeley, CA",61,23,,2.0,8/9/2012,"I hate writing bad reviews on a restaurant I generally find just fine. This location though takes the cake. It has the worst service from start to finish and I've tried it out several times.  (1st) the front desk. One standout poor service was one evening she looked at me and said nothing. I said ""two for first available - my name"" she gave me a buzzer and looked at the person behind me. Not one word was exchanged and she looked so done with her job. Can't expect much more from some 16 year old. I walked just outside to wait and it never buzzed, but I saw someone who sat as far as the benches infront of PF changs get buzzed. We came in 30 minutes later and asked the status, and the same girl said ""you just have to wait"". We waited 15 more minutes in the lobby and asked the status, she said ""we called you already."" I said ""it never buzzed"" and she said ""ITS NOT MY FAULT YOU LEFT THE LOBBY - IT ONLY WORKS IN THE LOBBY."" I responded ""so you want about 50 people to stand in that 7 foot square area by the door?"" Awful. We really thought that she was menstruating and the rest of the service would be cheesecake factory style service.  I was wrong (2nd) We sat down and there were crumbs and butter smears on the table and before we could say anything the busser came and wiped it up into our laps. SO UNLIKE CHEESECAKE FACTORY. Lastly, our waiter was sweet but (3rd) really knew nothing about the menu and status of things and should've been with an experienced waiter. I ordered 3 times before I finally got something that they actually had. When he came out with a bowl of soup I saw it completely tilted in the backwaiter's arm and the soup had spilled all over the wide rim of the bowl on one side. He was completely unprofessional  I am not going to stop coming to cheesecake factory altogether I think, but certainly will not waste my money on this location."
C W.,"Hayward, CA",2,108,6,4.0,5/8/2011,Service is outstanding! Portions we very large. Wait was way too long. The place was clean.
Happi F.,"Pleasanton, CA",0,3,,4.0,5/6/2011,"My order today was a breaded chicken dish over a pasta that was advertised to be covered with proscutto and pesto cream sauce..The chicken was delicious,but there was no pesto cream sauce on the chicken and a miniscule amount on the pasta making the pasta tasteless on an otherwise yummy dish..When I was asked how I liked the meal, I was honest and told them . They immediately checked with the chef who admitted he had gone a little too light on the sauce. They then gave me a full meal with the proper amount of sauce to take home ..My husband had it for dinner and loved it..Kudos to Cheese Cake Factory and to the manager today who made it right..Yummy food and classy service..can't do better than that!"
Brandon D.,"Pleasanton, CA",0,39,,4.0,1/7/2007,"I went with my family to this new location before Christmas Eve and we were told it would take 3 and a half hours to get a table.  We didn't mind, since it is Cheesecake Factory after all and this location just so happens to be conveniently placed in a mall, so we had something to do to kill time.  If you decide to do some shopping while you wait for your table, do so at your own risk!  Those pagers have a limited range and may not work inside the mall.  So we came back after only 90 minutes and I checked again and they told me we only had to wait 30 more minutes.  There's another thing to watch out for: sometimes your wait will be significantly shorter than what they tell you.  I think they purposely overshoot the waiting time to scare people away who aren't serious about eating there. Our party was small, just me and my parents, but they gave us this very nice huge corner booth which could fit 10 people.  All that was missing was another wall and it could have been like a small VIP room.  For an appetizer we got Firecracker Salmon Rolls, which were good, but scarcely enough for 3 hungry people.  I generally order the Chicken Medallions, but this time I got the Steak Diane and Shrimp Scampi combo.  I'm pretty sure the sauce they put on the steak is the same that they use for Pasta Da Vinci, so if you're a fan of that, then you'll like the Steak Diane as well.  The mashed potatoes never fail to blow me away!  They were simply awesome.  For a drink I had a Long Island Iced Tea.  It tasted fine, but wasn't strong enough for me.  We were all too full at the end, so we just split a single slice of Toblerone Cheesecake for dessert. My first impression of the Stoneridge location was that the inside seemed smaller.  I'm almost positive it's smaller than Palo Alto.  However they do make up for it with a large outdoor section (with heaters!) that can rival the San Francisco location in size.  The restaurant is part of the mall, but like Todai, there is no direct entrance from inside the mall, so you have to go outside to get to the restaurant entrance.  I also found it interesting that the restaurant had its own vallet parking lane right in front of the restaurant!  Not even the Palo Alto location has this! The only thing keeping me from awarding 5 stars was that this location seemed smaller than the others.  While it is still large compared to most restaurants in the area, I found it small by Cheesecake Factory standards.  I'm not deducting points for the long wait, because that's to be expected.  One advantage this location has is that unlike the SF and Palo Alto locations, this one isn't in a major tourist destination.  This means that the crowds shouldn't be too huge once the initial hype dies down, and the restaurant will serve mostly locals."
Christine R.,"Fremont, CA",145,348,538,4.0,4/16/2008,"Ate at this location for the first time with the family last week. We were a party of 10- which is considered a large group, so we had to wait for the manager to come talk to us. Luckily, the manager said that another large party was just getting to their dessert so we shouldn't have to wait long. We ended up waiting for about 20-30 minutes on a Wednesday night.  Although they knew we were a party of 10, they did not have our table prepared for 10 people (including 1 high chair). We found that a little weird, but it didn't take long for them to get the few extra chairs that we needed. Our server was Ashley and she had a young gentleman assisting her (his name I forgot). Ashley and assistant were very nice and attentive and professional.  We received our drinks and appetizers rather quickly. We leisurely ate our appetizers, and then we waited. And waited. And waited. It took awhile to receive our entrees, but once we did, we forgot about the wait as the food was pretty good. I ordered the Bistro Shrimp Pasta which was Crispy Battered Shrimp, Fresh Mushrooms, Fresh Tomato and Arugula Tossed with Spaghettini and a Delicious Basil-Garlic-Lemon Cream Sauce. Although I didn't taste the lemon in the sauce, I thought the dish was pretty cool. My bff had the Wasabi Crusted Ahi Tuna which was pretty yummy as well. That wasabi crust wasn't what I expected but tasted cool.  Oh course, I couldn't pass up their cheesecake so I decided on a slice of the white chocolate and macadamia caramel cheesecake to take home. They had a pistacchio one that sounded delish but I didn't want to be a pig.  Overall, I liked our dinner at this location. Sure, there was a little bit of a wait, but it was nothing like the hour(s) long waits at the SF location which is why I haven't eaten there more than I have. We experienced good service and the food filled my tummy. I'll definitely be going back, if not for an actual meal, but for some cheesecake to take home. Kudos for it  being open ""so late"" (11pm) on a weeknight."
Joy A.,"Santa Clara, CA",36,254,263,4.0,5/4/2010,"i am not typically a fan of chain restaurants but had a nice experience here last sunday. first, they offer brunch on sundays - and the hubby had a really great crab hash/eggs benedict. it was really yummy. i had the shepherd's pie and it was also really good.  for dessert, we took cheesecake to go. hubby had the coconut cream on a chocolate macaroon crust; i had the banana cream - both were excellent tho i am partial to the banana since it is much lighter. (taste not necessarily calories). service was also really great. we waited only about 5 minutes and service was swift and pretty attentive. we will definitely have brunch here again."
Shawn W.,"Oakland, CA",0,9,,2.0,2/23/2011,I prefer the cheesecake factory at S.F. more. This place holds back on giving larger portions. My favorite dish is the Farfelle and chicken gumbo. I went to this cheesecake factory numerous times because we don't wanna search for parking at S.F. and we wanted to shop around at stoneridge. I ordered the flame grilled artichoke once and they only gave me two and a half artichokes that was the size of an apple ... what happened to the other half? haha the customer service was awesome but i assume it's pretty good in any cheesecake factory. My appetizer and dish cost me 33 dollars including tax and tips and next time im going to S.F. for sure unless the bridge is closed
Mary Margret P.,"Oakland, CA",17,20,,3.0,4/6/2013,"I've always liked this place since they opened. Went on a Wed evening around 6:30. no reservations with 5. Only waited 15 mins. It was bright & sunny wen we arrived & were asked if we wanted to sit outside but me being cold alot I knew that being it still spring I would get clod so opted out of that.   Seated quickly & got menus. way too much stuff to choose from. Always takes me too long but I got the teriyaki chicken with brown rice.   As always it was great, hot & didn't have to wait long. Super large portions so I always have enough for the next day!!!   As we continued with the meal the sun was setting & they opened the blinds. But when the sun was gone it was like a dungeon. Dark, so dark.   The waitress was great & very personable. She brought the menus back so we cold look at them. i picked the raspberry chocolate cheese cake. When she broght it, it was so dark inside that I could hardly see the beautiful cheese cake I had ordered.    BIG pet peeve, why do restaurants insist on make it so dark you can't look at your food & see what your eating? I'm sorry but romantic is for at home. I wana see the food that I'm eating & gota pay for.   So that's why they only get 3 stars. Turn up the lights will you please???"
Brian R.,"Valencia, CA",0,2,,1.0,1/5/2010,I wish I could give 0 stars. Just got a slice of cheesecake to go and when I went to eat it I was greeted with not 1 but 2 hairs IN the cheesecake. Gross! I will not be back...ever.
Jessie B.,"San Leandro, CA",79,171,22,4.0,5/3/2009,"The fam & I had a late lunch here last week.  My sis & I decided on the Factory Burgers on sourdough french, which were pretty tasty.  Mom & Maya shared the Everything Pizza, and Dad had the Chicken and Biscuits, which we all devoured as soon as his plate hit the table.  We shared the carrot cake cheesecake, chocolate coconut cream cheesecake and the white chocolate macadamia nut with caramel creation.  A little goes a long way with these decedent treats.  Our substitute waitress, Jennifer was great, and our first was good, but can't remember her name.  Plenty of mall parking.  Good place for groups."
Ann B.,"Vancouver, WA",98,138,,3.0,6/15/2008,"5 stars for my favorite cheesecakes:  white chocolate macadamia nut, godiva, white chocolate raspberry truffle, tiramisu 4 stars for my standby entrees:  cajun jambalaya pasta, crabcake sandwich 1 star for the undercooked chicken  2 stars for the DIRTY bathroom, disgusting floors throughout the restaurant (I almost slipped twice) So my average?  3 stars.  It's fun, the cheesecake is divine.  Maybe next time I'll order something that can't give me food poisoning if it's undercooked - like...a martini!"
