Eric K.,"Dublin, CA",45,1116,9,3.0,4/12/2010,"a pretty typical cheesecake factory.  there was a line out the door, but I walked in and nabbed a table at the bar just as it cleared.   Service was good, and the food was predictable, albeit overpriced and only soso.   Came here on a pair of gift cards... what can I say  really?  $7 for a slice of cheesecake?  comon!"
Amin S.,"Pleasanton, CA",2,11,,2.0,2/5/2013,"I like cheesecake factory in general, but this one has the worst service. I usually order my food to go in a timely matter so by the time I get there, the food should already be ready for me to pay for and go. Unfortunately, I always seem to be waiting for my food, and this is never the case with PF changs or any of the establishments that are in this same shopping center. The food always comes out great, it just comes too late."
Bunny J.,"San Francisco, CA",6,274,103,3.0,7/2/2007,"I was lucky enough to have a couple of friends wait for our table an hour ahead of time which is half the battle. I did notice that the restaurant started to clear out at around 9:30-10:00pm where there would be no wait.  I've been a fan of the Factory for 10+ years when I would frequent the SoCal locations. I noticed that the portions have been getting smaller...maybe it's a Northern California thing. I've eaten at the San Francisco, San Jose and Pleasanton locations and the portions have significantly decreased from those in Southern California. My favorite is still the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp but even that is not as flavorful as it used to be. I'll always love the cheesecake...they can do no wrong with that! the service was still good even though the place was packed. The selection has always been great...something for everybody."
Ruhullah P.,"Dublin, CA",2,8,,3.0,10/26/2010,Food is good. People are good. But I don't like that I have to wait 10min to get seated then when I am seated it's right next to other people feel like im having dinner with complete strangers.
Derek C.,"Turlock, CA",2,12,,4.0,10/16/2010,"I enjoyed this place a lot.  The food was great, the drinks from the bar were awesome and the wait time was not very long.  I defiantly recommend this place."
Harold L.,"Chula Vista, CA",59,218,17,4.0,6/15/2010,"Its great to go somewhere that has extensive selection offerings. For about $10 I had a great chicken salad sandwich combo. The sandwich was the bomb, came with a very good salad (better then most) and a bowl of mushroom soup. I couldn't believe the combo came with a regular size bowl of soup and not just a small cup. We ate outside in the sun. Very nice. Not everything on the menu is such a great value, but you have to get them credit, they did it right!"
Erica S.,"San Jose, CA",248,1371,348,3.0,4/2/2007,"I just picked up a whole cheesecake to go the other day.  Don't know why but it took 15 minutes to order, pay, and get the cheesecake.  I ordered the White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle cheesecake.  It was a little too sweet for my taste."
Jim Y.,"Singapore, Singapore",0,74,4,3.0,1/27/2011,One would think that the pizza in a place like this would be out of this world but all it is is OK. But their deserts are outstanding.
Rachel B.,"San Leandro, CA",8,11,,3.0,5/6/2009,This was my first experience with this place. Overall the food was good and so was the service. We were seated right away which was awesome for a Friday evening. The only con I have is that they don't have a kids menu. What's up with that?
Karen G.,"Turlock, CA",307,611,7,4.0,2/8/2009,"I don't care what anybody says...I love The Cheesecake Factory.  Yes, it's true.  I mean, for a chain restaurant, it is definitely one of the better ones in my opinion. The menu is huge!  Two pages of cocktails, two pages of apps and two pages of cheesecake and desserts.  And that doesn't even cover the entrees!  The portions are huge!  I have never been able to clean my plate when dining here.  I always end up taking food home, which makes for a nice dinner or lunch later on.  As large as the menu is, I usually end up ordering from a select group of items.   So, in no particular order, here is my top ten list of my favorite things from The Cheesecake Factory: 1.  JW's Pink Lemonade: this is the most refreshing cocktail especially on a summer day.  It's made with vodka, chambord and of course lemonade.  Cheers! 2.  Fire-Grilled Artichoke:  I love artichokes and I especially love fire roasted ones.  This one has a yummy dipping sauce served on the side. 3.  Shrimp Summer Rolls:  such a nice alternative to egg rolls, and much healthier too. 4.  Thai Lettuce Wraps:  This is featured on the apps menu, but it makes a nice and healthy lunch entree.  I love all of the dipping sauces too. 5.  Turkey Burger:  This is the best turkey burger I have ever had, hands down.  It is so meaty and flavorful.  It is made with turkey, mushrooms, garlic seasoning and spices.  Juicy! 6.  Original Cheesecake:  don't mess with the original.  I love it with strawberries too. 7.  Chocolate Coconut Cheesecake:  reminds me of a Mounds bar. 8.  Tiramisu Cheesecake:  a nice take on the traditional Italian dessert combined with cheesecake. 9.  Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Cheesecake:  if you like cookie dough, then you will probably love this dessert. 10.  Banana Cream Cheesecake:  like a banana cream pie elevated to a higher level.   Mangia mangia!"
Barney F.,"Castro Valley, CA",11,203,1,4.0,3/28/2010,"Didn't look like a recession here. We had to wait over an hour for a table on a Saturday night. The food was well worth the wait. I had the BBQ salmon which was pretty good. Others had pasta, chicken, steak, and all were happy with their food. Of course a couple of us had cheesecake which of course never disappoints. The service was good, food was good, and besides the wait, it would have gotten 5 stars. This is as good as it gets for casual dining."
sheetal t.,"San Jose, CA",27,36,1,3.0,5/9/2010,Birthday celebration was awesome !! great food !!
Sandy M.,"Hayward, CA",346,129,10,5.0,11/27/2007,Great for parties. They have everything and anything you want. I LOOOOOVVVVVVEEEEEE THE LUAU SALAD. MY FAVORITE. I am Addicted.  Service is always awesome. I LOVVVEEEE CHEESECAKE FACTORY!!!!!!! LUAU SALAD AND STEAK DIANE!!!! ALWAYS ALWAYS AWESOME! Sunday brunch rocks socks too!
David T.,"Livermore, CA",1,20,,4.0,5/16/2009,This place always has line but I hit the bar during happy hour without one.  Tried the sliders here & they were cooked as ordered.  The only thing is Cheesecake Factory doesn't have tomato slices for the sliders.  So ketchup will work but everyone else has at least some sort of tomatoes with the sliders.  Service was pretty good overall & the bartender had no problem taking care of the super flat cardboard tasting Ceasar salad.  It was off the tab & away promptly.  Needless to say I won't order the Ceasar again.  They have great huge desserts.
Marie G.,"Danville, CA",13,107,,2.0,2/23/2009,Well the service has sucked every time i have ever been. The food is very overrated. I do love the cheesecake though so go for a yummy desert.
Da M.,"Oakland, CA",0,15,,1.0,2/23/2009,"Went here for dinner on Friday (2/20) at around 8:30, we were told the wait would be 45min - an hour. Finally seated around 9:50. We had the rudest most stuck up waitress I've ever encountered. My friend (who is an extreme extrovert) smiled up at her and said ""HELLO THERE!"" and she just looked at her, threw the bread basket on our table and walked away. No hellos, no welcome to CF, nothing.  Anyways, she was incredibly unpleasant. The food here is horrible, definitely not constitent with other CFs. She never asked us how our meal was, took forever to take our orders, forget to bring us our cheescake. By the time we got the bill, it was around 11:00 pm. AND ONLY WHEN SHE DELIVERED THE CHECK DID SHE CRACK A SMILE. Last ditch effort for a tip I suppose - which she didn't get (and I'm an AMAZZZZZING TIPPER, THE SERVICE CAN BE AIIIIGHT AND I'LL STILL TIP DECENTLY). The economy sucks, she should buck up and be happy to be employed with so many people on the job hunt. I should've gone to the Santa Clara CF like I had orignally planned. Will not be returning here and WILL NOT be recommending others to come as well. BTW, my brother's GF said she had a similar experience here and judging by the other ratings and comments, this was not an isolated incident."
Carlie R.,"San Francisco, CA",45,19,,4.0,1/7/2009,"We decided to leave the city and take a drive and ended up here at the Stoneridge Mall. So we ate at the cheesecake factory. We were seated right away due to it being 3pm. Good time to go there if you don't want to wait forever. So 4 stars for being seated right away. Our server was with us within about 5 min. It's a good thing, because my Mother has no  patience. We ordered, sipped our drinks and within somewhere around 20 minutes our food arrived. All things considered we were very happy with our expierence at this CF."
Darren P.,"Union City, CA",87,15,,3.0,2/16/2012,meh... over crowded.. ok service. good food... almost unbalanced... give it a 3... I've heard they have great cheese cake lol..
MY LEMON T.,"Hayward, CA",0,8,,4.0,11/30/2010,"After a long morning at the mall, my girls and I came here for afternoon brunch. Luckily, this time we didn't have to wait long, go figure it is 3 in the afternoon. Had the friendly staff to serve us, our host to the table was so kind he keep on turning around to start a conversation with us. I kind remember what I had ordered, but it was some chicken pasta on the lunch list and it was so delicious,  i tried to finish the whole plate but couldn't stuff myself anymore. II am giving them 4 stars because normally, the wait is so long."
Jboogie L.,"San Francisco, CA",30,2182,879,2.0,8/18/2007,"I always say....big portions make americans eat more thus gaining unneeded weight.   My cajun jambalaya dish was huge.  Although I felt like it was something I could of made myself at home.   The chocolate Raspberry cheesecake. Hmm, Where was the taste of the Raspberry?"
