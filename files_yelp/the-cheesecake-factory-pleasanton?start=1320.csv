Candice S.,"San Francisco, CA",61,220,4,5.0,2/9/2008,"Alright, alright I know this place is super obvious and there are about fifty million of them out there, but I just HAD to! I can't get enough of the Cheesecake factory!  It's like my little black dress of a restaurant.  It never goes out of style, you can frequent it all the time without judgement, and it's HOT!  I love everything from the oat-wheat bread to the giNORMOUS salads and entrees.  Had to give a shout out to my c-cake spot ;)."
M M.,"Pleasanton, CA",0,15,2,5.0,5/14/2012,The food is consistently tasty and the service is perfect. On weekday evenings it is great place to go because it is always open and the server is not trying to kick you out because it is after 10 pm
Crystal T.,"Rialto, CA",45,24,,3.0,3/20/2010,After another email sent to the company I finally got a call from their manager. I think his name was Kevin or Adam. He said that apparently another manager had called me before but that didn't happen. He said he would look into it for me. He also apologized for our bad experience at the restaurant and is sending us a $35 gift card. We'll be giving them a second chance now that we got some free money to use. We'll have to see how it goes
G. W.,"Castro Valley, CA",0,149,5,3.0,1/30/2010,"I've been a few times since my first review.  Now at 2.75 stars.  Service is always good, but there is a lack of consistency in the dishes and bar drinks, and really none of the dishes have flair.  And I get tired of the wait.  I wonder if there is something to the conjecture that they use the wait to make the place seem more desirable.   Still on a good night it can be nice enough."
Sean B.,"Alameda, CA",16,61,3,4.0,1/24/2008,"I'm trying to do more reviews near Pleasanton for my new yelp friend !! I know its a chain also but I hate to say it, the food is pretty good, the dessert of course is fabulous and staff is friendly. Besides, I always forget names of restaurants I've been to...LOL. Of course, its a zoo in there sometimes....you can get a buzzer and they will tell you sometimes 2 hours or more wait time!!!!. My recommendation, either go early, get your buzzer, walk the mall and then come back in an hour and you should be close or it is open seating at the bar and the marble tables right behind the bar so just stand around those and you can get a table quicker. If its too bad, they have a PF Chang's right next door too which is great."
Joe C.,"Rodeo, CA",1,26,,4.0,4/20/2008,"We arrived right before the lunch rush on saturday and were seated right away.  The server was pretty friendly and kept our water glasses full.  There are too many items on the menu and there was lots of changing our minds as to  what to have. I settled on the Cuban Sandwhich and my companion had one of the chicken sandwhiches.  My Cuban was big, cooked all the way through and cheesy.  My companions chicken was a bit rubbery which she mentioned to the server who apologized.  I had the low carb cheesecake slice for dessert. I asked them to cut it in half and put one half in a to go box. Ditto on half of my sandwhich. All in all, I'd probably go back, if for nothing else to try some of the pasta. With so many choices of different dishes, there is something for everybody. However, my take on this place is that  a lot of the dishes can be found elsewhere for a little less. It is a convenient stop whilst taking a shopping break from the mall."
Joe P.,"Salt Lake City, UT",25,97,16,3.0,8/29/2009,5 Stars for amazing cheesecakes 4 Stars for quality service 3 Stars for the meal 1 Star for waiting 60 minutes for a table for 2 on a Friday night
Donald S.,"Castro Valley, CA",123,200,1,4.0,10/17/2009,You do have to wait awhile in line but I think it is worth it The selection is great and the service is pretty good too I Jacey had a cheesecake yet but so fat everything I have eaten here is good More expensive then your tgi or applebess but the portions a pretty big
M B.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",0,10,,2.0,5/7/2014,"My last experience at Cheesecake Factory Pleasanton was not great.  I came with my two kids after being in the mall, in a post-shopping euphoria, you can say.  When we met our waiter, the HIGH quickly became a LOW; it was a bipolar kind of a day.  We were greeted lukewarm by him, just going through the motions I guess, but that's ok, everybody's entitled to being that way sometime.  I guess i like happy people around the kids and he just wasn't too happy to see kids, not that my kids are rowdy at all.  Anyhow, I asked for a high chair and again, no enthusiasm, downright hating the thought I think.  It took him a while to return, honestly about 15 minutes, but no apology, no excuse, just here it is!  Overall, we usually enjoy going to the mall here and also Cheesecake Factory after but this gentleman quickly extinguished my joy.  Sorry, maybe venting a little too much.  Food was drab after that."
Michelle C.,"Castro Valley, CA",141,319,28,3.0,9/21/2009,"Despite the mountain of calories you get with anything you order, I heart The Cheesecake Factory!  I have never encountered a meal that I did not love while I was there. The Stoneridge location is always packed with people because of the huge portions, good eats. Although we have not been in awhile because the wait time is scary when you want to grab a bite and go I am hoping to return for a visit soon."
Kristina G.,"Martinez, CA",145,67,12,3.0,4/10/2009,Okay compared to the one in Walnut Creek this one is SOOOOOO MUCH better! food was good! Service was fast and our waitress was really sweet! i would come here again!
jack q.,"Pacifica, CA",0,416,,2.0,7/29/2010,"Ordered a Banana Cream Cheesecake for my daughter's birthday.  Was quite surprised when I picked it up.  Not good surprised.  Holy Freaking Cr*p surprised!  $58 for a cheesecake?  Are you kidding me?  It was pretty tasty, I'll have to admit, but it should give you that ""special feeling"" at those prices.  Probably won't buy another one unless I hit the lotto..."
m L.,"San Francisco, CA",1,26,3,4.0,3/2/2012,"Food has been great most of the time I've been there.  If there was something wrong (ie. overcooked chicken, wrong beverage) the servers would rectify it promptly.  I think their food and especially desserts there taste good.  Havent had a bad experience in terms of the quality of the food.  I only gave it a 4star instead of 5 because it's a hit or miss on the quality of the server.  Sometimes I get great service and sometimes I have to hunt one down just to get a refill on water."
Mag B.,"Scituate, MA",0,50,,5.0,6/30/2012,"I've never had a bad experience here (or any other Cheesecake Factory). Food is unfancy but tasty. If anything, portions are too big,  but that just means I take some home after the meal. My favorites: Chinese Chicken Salad, and Wild Mushroom Burger. Bread is good too! :)"
Matt C.,"Jupiter, FL",22,69,,1.0,9/11/2008,"Shitty service, shitty food, shitty venue.  Did I mention that this place is shitty?"
D G.,"Danville, CA",0,7,,4.0,6/19/2010,"I have always been a fan of this place, not because the food is amazing, don't get me wrong its good for what you pay and the portions are a nice size.  Unlike most times when I go out to eat at a chain of some sort I don't leave here feeling disappointed and hungry.  The atmosphere here as far as my experiences go has always been excellent.  I never feel rushed, my bread has always been replenished and beverages refilled.  I wouldn't recommend this as fine dining but if you are looking for a slightly upscale place for a birthday dinner then The Cheesecake Factory will do just fine."
Maria M.,"Dublin, CA",5,6,6,1.0,1/31/2009,"I WILL NEVER GO BACK!!!!!!!!!!!! I've been to Cheesecake Factory several times I can't even count. Went on a Friday night with my boyfriend and was told the wait would be 45min-1hour. No problem. the food is worth waiting for. We waited 1 hour and 15 min. for our buzzer to go off. To make a long story short we didn't hear our name called IT'S WAY TOO LOUD IN THERE. We were told we would get the next available table, and saw that people behind us in line were being seated still even though the manager said we where next. Need lees to say I will never set foot in another cheesecake factory. The hostesses need a major attitude adjustment and a lesson in professionalism."
Lady S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,29,,2.0,3/19/2012,"The food was good, but the service wasn't great.  They were super busy and we waited for an hour and a half and when we were finally seated they asked my husband to move and sit in front of me not next to me like we hoped to sit b//c they were so busy that they needed the room to fit more people.  Then when we got the food we had to move over to make more room for another couple they were squeezing in. Oh, and did I mention how small their tables were!!! I almost hit my glass with my hand a few times b/c of how crowded we were.  I won't be visiting them again..."
Sara L.,"Riverside, CA",74,188,40,3.0,4/19/2009,I love the ribeye marinated in cajun spices definitely a must try. They also have massive burgers that are great. Service here varies.
JK W.,"Antioch, CA",0,8,7,1.0,4/28/2011,"Tried to call and place a pick up order & I was asked if I could hold.  I said sure.  At this time I'm already driving there for my lunchtime.  Took me about 10 min to get there and I'm still on hold.  I walk in and i was greeted and asked if she can help me.  I said YES, I'm still on hold trying to place an order and I showed her my phone. There excuse was they were busy but when I walked in, it did not look that busy."
