Jason B.,"Pleasanton, CA",446,142,54,4.0,1/17/2009,"My wife and I had an early dinner here tonight and we both walked away a little happier this time than last. First off, our server was a very nice, attentive young girl who actually loved her job. She made our meal that much better and made sure she gave us enough attention without suffocating us with canned questions. The food and drinks came out super quick, was hot and tasted great. A much better experience than last time."
Stephanie D.,"Alameda, CA",212,438,878,4.0,5/25/2011,"Busy busy busy at all times of the day. Well except right after they open and the hubs need a Bloody Mary fix before we get the shopping day started. Another other time good luck. Min we've waited for a table for 2 is 45mins at any other time in the day. But all in all it's worth it. The lunch specials you can't beat! The prices are great and you still get a very generous portion to grub on. My fave is the miso salmon. They cook the fish to perfection and the sauce accompanying it is not too sweet or salty. I go for the mashed potatoes instead of the rice. But that's just me. Another great option they offer are their small plates. Perfect for sampling and sharing without feeling like you've over ordered. And of course, what would a trip to Cheesecake be without any of their cheesecakes! The BEST on my list are the blueberry white chocolate, dutch apple caramel, red velvet & pumpkin. Of course I never have room to actually consume a slice here so what do I do? I order a couple to go of course. They keep for a day or 2 really well. Or maybe that's only how long they last in my house."
Nancy H.,"Livermore, CA",33,33,8,3.0,11/10/2011,"I dunno.... They do have some pretty good food but today when I came in for some warm food I was disappointed with the service, I don't know if dude was new, busy, or just didn't care. We ordered some coffees, which to he came back with some cokes, no big deal. So he shows up with our coffees, do we need sugar? Ofcourse, I said... 10 minutes later and my coffee is cooling down by the second, no sugar. Finally I spotted some sugar at the near by counter, got it myself. Waiter lacked memory of my request. NO bread either while we waited.. it came way later. We ordered our entrees, and i also ordered the soup of the day as an appetizer. It was 3 of us, all of our food came at 5 minute intervals between each dish. so upon arrival of the first dish we waited til the last person had their dish to eat, pretty weird. No soup yet and here comes my entree... So i tell the girl giving me my entree that I ordered a soup but no longer want it. And here comes my waiter, with the soup. Oh, you don't want the soup?? WTH its an appetizer, NO I DONT WANT THE DAMN SOUP!! I wanted it 15 minutes ago!!! The girl apologized, He didn't care. No checking up on us, no coffee refill from him. I do have to say there was another blonde lady giving us our food and she completely made our experience way BETTER. She was helping us 100% more than our so-called waiter. Gave us fresh coffee!!! The coffee that he gave us tasted like water, and mine wasn't even full. I usually have really  cheerful and attentive waiters, this dude... NO!! I SAID NO!!!"
S S.,"Livermore, CA",0,6,,3.0,3/31/2009,"I finally had dinner at CCF, nice place, well decorated, but too loud 4 me and the food was not so good. But I think I will give a second try."
natasha z.,"Dublin, CA",8,74,,2.0,8/29/2008,"Overrated and boring...The management at this particular location SUCKS.  My neighbor and boyfriend were having lunch one afternoon and the bus boy was trying to get his work load done fast so he piled a bunch of glass cups on his bus boy tray (just plain LAZY) Well, of course if you pile 20 heavy duty glass cups, gravity will take it's course and than you have a huge catastrophe.  Glass went shattering to the floor and small piece flew right into my neighbors eye.  Well management failed to apologize really and didn't even comp the bill.  Usually when something ridiculous like this happens the manager is suppose to come out and apologize and do everything in their power to compensate the customer. UMMMM  talk about lack of business and customer service skills.....thank god my neighbor still has his eyeball."
Joe H.,"El Dorado Hills, CA",481,32,3,4.0,10/24/2009,"The Catfish w/ Pecans special today was excellent. The russet mashed potatoes and mixed veggies that came with it were top shelf. The veggies had a sweet flavor to them, I could not identify it. The sauce served with the catfish had a mild curry flavor which went very well with the entire dish. Service is almost always good to great. Today was a little better than usual."
Michelle L.,"Walnut Creek, CA",4,25,,2.0,10/13/2008,"I know this place is supposed to be the cat's meow, but honestly, I don't see what the big deal is about.  First off, the only reason I gave it even two stars is because the JW Pink Lemonade cocktail kicks butt.  Oh, and my friend thinks their pomegranate mojito is pretty good.  Other than that, meh. Yesterday I went shopping for pants in the Stoneridge Mall with my buddy.  Afterwards we decided to grab a quick bite at the Factory.  Should have just walked away.  I ordered a BLT small salad and we shared the Vietnamese spring rolls.  When we sat down, my bread plate had crumbs on it and when the waiter came with butter for the bread, there was a piece of wilted lettuce attached to the butter.  Not impressed.  The salad was the kicker though.  It came drenched in ranch dressing and after one bite of literally drinking dressing, I had to send it back.  I couldn't taste anything.  They replaced the salad with dressing on the side (as requested) but my stomach was still a little pissed at me for the previous bites.  Oh well, over-priced restaurants are just not my thing."
Jaimito C.,"Hayward, CA",8,40,1,2.0,5/10/2011,"based on my last experience, BLEH!!!!! i put two stars because the fried mac n cheese balls are great! So ive been here numerous times and it has been okay but this last time the food was horrible. I actually went on easter sunday with my girlfriend and it was busy but suprisingly we got a table in less than 15 minutes. The waitress was nice BUT, and i mean BUT!, she messed up my order. I order chicken alfredo and the i got chicken alfredo but again, BUT, the damn plate was served with dried tomatoes or whater their othe option on the dish is served with. I waz hungry and i dont like to complain when at restaurants and people i cant see are handling my food so i dealt with it. I took my bite n was like eh okay whatever i didnt gag so ill eat it. Let me just tell ya, they were skimpy on the chicken, the sauce was watery, the pasta was over boiled and the chicken i mentioned was dry. I assumed since they were so busy and they have too large of a menu was the reason my dish was horrible. I think they need to make the menu smaller and specialize on certain items and perfect it. Worst cicken alfredo i have ever have and im not a snobby person with high expectations but when it comes to pasta, get it right kid. Fail. So my girlfrie.d, ordered chicken tacos cause she tries to be healthy and stay away from red meat n stuff. Anyways, it was pretty funny seein her reaction. She said yuck and didnt want to continue eating her tacos. She said they were super dry (the meat), and had no flavor. Some sour cream may habe helped alot. She ended up eating one because she was hungry and took the rest home and gave it too me since i am always hungry. I tried em and yea, flavorless. I didnt have sour cream so i put ranch on em and they turned out to be okay. So back to the restaurant, ambiance is cool. It can get pretty noisey in there, some servers try to hard and are a little too much with the bubbly-ness. The cheesecake is great but depending where you sit, you may get tired of being there and want to leave. If you get a booth or private table, perfect but if you get a table that's right next to another, no privacy. Eh ill try again in half a year but for now i dislike this place."
Neil K.,"Fremont, CA",5,511,1,3.0,9/11/2008,"Their cheesecakes are ok, but the rest of the menu is really average.  First of all, if you go there, it's more like a club than a restaurant.  The spacing of the place looks big but when you actually sit down, it feels like you need more room.  Wait times are horrendous on Friday/Saturday nights and even some weekdays."
Maya W.,"Oakland, CA",15,85,,1.0,8/19/2008,"We ate at the Pleasanton location after going to the Alameda County Fair. We got a seat right away which was nice. Too bad the food was disgusting. We ordered the chicken wings (edible), mac & cheese (disgusting) and the chicken marsala (bland, absolutely no flavor). Our cocktails were mediocre and so was the service. How do you f up mac & cheese?? The cheesecake was pretty good but at $8 a slice it had better be."
Mrs. R.,"Castro Valley, CA",6,30,7,2.0,1/2/2009,"Stoneridge the day after the day-after-Christmas?  I must be certifiable!  And the truth was that my glass was half empty! I don't know, someone (obviously not a yelper) told me this place was ""good"" and had large and fulfilling portions. We had to do some last minute, local returns and exchanges and thought ""Why not?"" It wasn't a bad wait (just 30 minutes) and they gave us the ""buzzer,"" (which I really wish Ross would introduce for holiday shoppers. Wouldn't that be cool? So much more fun than standing in line, miserably waiting your turn; you could be browsing up to the last minute too. Think about it Ross. I would be so much nicer!)  ... but, I digress.   The house Chardonnay at $6.75 a glass was slightly less than 1/2 full (1/2 empty) in appearance.  I mean, we did a total double-take on the amount of wine vs. negative space!  It was embarassing, but we sent them back to the bar. I didn't want a half-empty glass of wine that badly! They sent someone out to assure us that they gave an ""8 ounce pour.""  Be that as it may, I wasn't going to insist that they bring out a certified measuring device just to be sure, and it was dissapointing enough so we just didn't want it anymore. The glitter was tarnished.  Enough with the ""Dr. Science"" show.  Just take the sad things back or fill them up to the 3/4 mark or get smaller wine glasses! Just don't make me pay for 'em now. Ahem! So, I ordered the Cobb Salad. It was weird. Literally everything has been minced to a fine watery mess. I could only assume that all the proper ingredients were there, because lord knows, I couldn't see them or taste them. I asked for some more dressing, hoping that would perk it up, but no. I was a big soupy, watery mess. Two bites and back it went too.  I'm sure they all thought I was crazy. They kept apologizing and saying ""Awww, you poor thing. We understand. Everyone has a bad day sometimes, right?""  Exactly as if they thought I was having a PMDS (pre menstrual dysphoric syndrome) moment and was off my meds and they'd better placate me before I whipped out a piece and started taking hostages. Gee, I only wish I was that scary.   And the coffee was weak, but my sister's Kahlua cheesecake was divine.  The total bill for 4 (2 sodas, 2 coffees, A garlic noodles with shrimp, a chicken piccata with pasta, A chicken club sandwich & 4 desserts) came to $90 something. And we left a tip as they did take practically my entire meal off the bill.  Sigh ... I guess it was ""one of those days,"" after all."
Nicole K.,"Concord, CA",92,56,1,1.0,3/27/2008,"I am a Cheesecake Factory frequenter...L.A., Hawaii, Las Vegas, SF to name a few.  I have been to this location 5 times and I don't know why I keep giving it another shot.  This place is notorious for telling you it's a 30 minute wait and then when you go back up to the desk in 30 minutes, they tell you it will be 25 minutes and they you wait another hour.  My boyfriend put it best, it's like any big restaurant chain, once they really establish themselves, they let the service and food quality go to crap and just keep raising the prices to make their huge profit.  Well, last night was just a disaster.  We always split a salad and the shrimp scampi since portions are huge.  The scampi was COLD (not luke warm COLD), shrimp tasted like chlorine, the noodles were either undercooked or dried out after cooking and the sauce was bland.  We always order extra cream sauce with roasted garlic on the side and this location never adds the garlic??  Our service was pitiful.  We had to ask 3 different times (for a party of 6) to have our water glasses refilled.  The waiter was in a bad mood and it took 1/2 hour for someone to take our entree order.  Has anyone else noticed that the cheesecake slices have gotten smaller? (they don't make it fresh on sight either, it's shipped in, blah). - negative - 5 stars for Cheesecake Factory, Pleasanton."
Robert C.,"San Leandro, CA",42,13,3,4.0,8/30/2010,first time ever going and it was a pretty fun experieance ended up sitting out side and they had the heaters on so it wasnt to cold the waiter was pretty funny and the food there was delicouse and i couldnt even finish it and i always finish my food so i cant complain pretty good the only thing i was suprised about was the bill but then we had 5 people to so not bad
Paulie L.,"San Francisco, CA",0,327,66,4.0,8/8/2008,"We ordered take-out, and everything was great. The service was good, the speed of the food was quite fast for a take out. Overall, everything was good, but it was quite expensive for a late dinner. One appentizer, two main course, two dessert, and two drinks $70. Really expensive for a dinner for 2. But it is Cheesecake Factory."
Paula G.,"San Francisco, CA",6,29,1,3.0,7/25/2009,I love the Cheesecake Factory! The menu has a lot of choices and you get what you pay for.  Our waiter at this location made the visit great. He was extremely attentive and looked like he enjoyed his job.
Anthony M.,"Union City, CA",88,51,1,2.0,4/6/2008,"you know i dont get what all the hype is about this restaurant. lik ehow people go here before proms or like some special occasion.  well. my story goes that me and my some friends went to stone ridge mall to buy something and they didnt believe that ive never eaten there before.  so at that time i was ballin with money and so were my friends cause we just got jobs and decided to eat there. so we see people all dressed like they wanted to impress someone and get our waiting pager thingapeiceofcrap, and wait like 20 minutes for a table of 4. we get it, we get a cute waitress that was super nice and friendly and informed us about the specials and we go over the menu. there was like so many kinds of food i was getting all pissed cause i was imagining how good some of them would be with or without things.  and like so many exotic wannabe ass selections. so i got some jamaican rice and jambalaya shit while my friends for the BBQ combo thing with like bbq ribs and chicken, and my other friend got this mexican platter thing.  the food was pretty good, but not like where im so impressed and want to frequent this thing. it made me feel like i was in some pimped out  TGI Fridays or something. im not really a fan of those kinds of places.  Cheesecake factory is like if you went to Union Landing and combined all restaurants there into one place and didnt include the good dishes and you pay 10 bucks more."
Honest O.,"San Francisco, CA",15,48,155,5.0,4/25/2008,"This place is great and the service is always amazing. I noticed when I went to the bathroom every employee moved out of my way to let me go first. A thing I wouldn't normally notice, but it was nice. The food is always good and you get plenty for leftovers!!"
M C.,"Richmond, CA",0,137,,3.0,9/21/2011,"3.5 stars This place can get busy busy busy!! Last time waited 45 minutes for a table. Was meeting friends on a Saturday night, so it was expected. Since it is so popular, it can get very loud, especially with big families.  The food is good. I used to get the Navajo sandwich all the time, but now stick to the small plate menu (stuffed mushrooms, corn fritters, arugula salad, etc) so I can have room for dessert! Just wish they had a peanut butter cheesecake that was not made of candy pieces.  Service is usually good although once we had to complain. We were seated and given menus and that's all. 2 tables that were seated after us were given beverages and orders were taken. So we left. We spoke to the mananger on the way out. He apologized and said if we ever came back, he would take care of us. About 2 months later, we went for lunch. The same manager was there and he remembered us. When we got our final tab, we were only charged for our drinks! The food was comped. We still gave the waitress the tip based on the full bill, of course. :) I would still go to this location, just not during dinnertime on weekends perhaps.  I think I like the Corte Madera location better."
Betty R.,"San Ramon, CA",1,40,,4.0,7/5/2011,Always been great and consistent......except for the tacos.  Every time we order them they are different.  Be prepared to wait though if you come at a peak time.
Maryanne D.,"San Francisco, CA",55,247,46,4.0,7/1/2008,"Okay, so the wait is horrendous so do yourself a favor and just put your name on the list and get a buzzer.  Then head into the mall and do some shopping or run some errands or something.  Just come back the time they quote you which is usually an hour.  Even if they call your name and you are not back in time, they will still seat you next given that you aren't extremely late.   I love the salads here.  The portions are huge and the price is right given the amount of food you get.  My husband and I shared the BBQ Ranch Salad $12.95 and it was actually enough to feed three people.  We were stuffed and still had enough left over's to feed a third person.  Do the math, that's about $4.50 a person - not bad right? Try the Dulce Le Leche cheesecake.  You'll thank me later =)."
