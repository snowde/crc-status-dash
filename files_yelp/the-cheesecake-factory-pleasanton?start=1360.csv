Jay E.,"Oakland, CA",21,281,12,2.0,2/15/2009,Been there once for sons big birthday dinner. Appetizers were on hit. drinks were on hit. main course sucked. dessert was on hit. thats it thats all. Wait with reservations was F***up. it aint all that ...except the desserts.
Scott H.,"Livermore, CA",15,10,,4.0,5/21/2011,"Good food and drinks.  Inside atmosphere is nice, however, outside is a mall parking lot.  I have not had a bad meal from here.  I am not of fan of the cheesecakes, but the drinks and dinners are very good.  It can get a little bit pricey with a large group."
H H.,"Union City, CA",253,261,67,3.0,1/1/2009,"Is it just me or is Cheesecake Factory better in So. Cal than No. Cal? Ate lunch here last weekend, had to wait forever, then get a dinky table outside.   Our young waiter admitted he was new, but service was good, he went to the kitchen to ask about ingredients in the soup when he could no answer out question, and he did move our table when the sun was glaring on my face. Bread was good.  Chicken salad was good in an average sort of way. I asked for fish n chips-but salad instead of fries.  The side salad was surprisingly fresh, and coleslaw had capers which made it good (but too few), the fish were SO disappointing!  How does one screw up breaded fish??  Come on, you could just take it from a freezer at Trader Joe's  and quick fry it.  The breading was not crispy, it was almost chewy, and I wound up conducting surgery on my plate to dissect it all away from the edible fish portion. Lame. Good thing we had a gift card and did'nt have to pay! I am a fan of Pumpkin, White Chocolate Raspberry, and Key Lime Cheesecake here (hate their Americanized Tiramisu) but we opted out this time."
Melisa W.,"Oakland, CA",33,37,16,1.0,10/16/2007,"From LA to San Jose to San Fran to Sacramento back down to Pleasanton -I have NEVER had a positive experience in Cheesecake Factory..... NEVER. It all starts with the fact that for some reason they don't find the concept of taking reservations helpful. Instead they like to make groups of people (large parties and bratty children) hang out in the foyer and wait excessively long amounts of time and then proceed to serve you sub-par food. So it was no surprise when a few weekends back ""The Girls"" decided to have dinner there,  my first thought ""WTF?!?!?! Can't we go somewhere else? Benihana? El Torito? KFC?  Anywhere but there.""  But sadly I was outnumbered.  And Cheesecake didn't disappoint.   For a party of 7 we waited (like assholes) for 2.5 hours for a table.  Standing around having bad kids run over us and a large group of 25 get seated before us.  We waited so long that the nice couple (+.25).  in the bar area was sympathetic to our needs and insisted to the bartender that he should give us all free appetizers or cheesecake at least.  He didn't (-.25)  But while waiting I discovered the one good thing about the place... Strawberry martinis (+.25/each. I had 2 for a total of +.50).  They are so delicious and refreshing I recommend those over any of their cheesecakes any day.  So it is 10pm and we finally get seated with the help of an incredibly nice and sympathetic waiter (+.25).  But of course it is so late I don't want to order the trough of food they serve so I order a salad and clam chowder.  Again, for consistency sake, they do not disappoint... the chowder was weak, not creamy at all, bland with no clams (hmmmm isn't clam chowder supposed to have a few clams at least?) and the salad... a heaping plate of unwashed mixed spring greens with the worst dressing ever!  I wish I would have brought a bottle of ranch in my purse!   Cheesecake Factory sucks.  Get with the times! Even PF Chang's takes reservations now!"
Larry G.,"San Ramon, CA",0,384,,4.0,12/15/2010,"Expect a LONG wait during dinner time.  Large menu (with advertising), ample parking in the mall lot.  Typical CF decor, no different here.  It's unique to all CF restaurants.  The Miso salmon is good as are a few other menu items. CF is a large chain restaurant with a big menu and okay tasting food overall.  You have to find something you like on this expansive menu, there's something for everyone.  While there is a large variety of cheesecakes, I think the frozen NY cheesecake from Trader Joe's is better.  Portions are usually large, many folks leave with a doggy bag.  I don't know anyone that does not like CF.  Actually, in front of CF is a good SAFE place to park in the mall, it's always busy with people walking to and from their cars and someone from valet parking is standing at the curb.  It can be pricey, but it's better than going to most other chain restaurants.  Always a pleasant expereience here, always busy."
Jeff L.,"San Marcos, CA",6,15,305,4.0,1/11/2008,Applebee's on steroids.  Bring lots of money.
Shan L.,"San Leandro, CA",0,6,,4.0,10/13/2011,"Come here for a few times, love their food, especially the pasta is s good!!! Services are good, cheesecakes are good, the only problem is the long line of waiting."
Tiffany T.,"Beaverton, OR",314,891,200,3.0,12/21/2006,"Ate there for lunch over the weekend and wasn't impressed. I like to send their cheesecakes as gifts through their website, I think cheesecake must be the best thing about this place. We showed up at 11:15 AM, it opens at 11:00 AM and we had a 45-minute wait. We had the calamari appetizer, which was good; it was fried rings of squid with tarter and cocktail sauce. My hubby ordered a side salad, which was very pretty; it had shredded beats, carrots and cucumbers on top and lots of croutons. He had the blue cheese dressing which tasted great, but was so thick it wouldn't pour on the salad. He had the barbeque pork sandwich with fries and coleslaw. The slaw was bland and too saucy and the cabbage wasn't shredded. His fries were cold, and the pork was also pretty bland for barbeque. He actually combined the blue cheese dressing and coleslaw with the sandwich, which he said improved it quite a bit. I ordered the Jambalaya over rice. It wasn't worth the price tag, it had 5 shrimp and 4 bits of chicken, probably 1 & 1/2 sliced green peppers, 1 onion and tomatoes that tasted and looked like they came from a can. It also had so much spice, it was more orange the red. It made me feel slightly ill and uncomfortable the rest of the day. We ordered a slice of the truffle chocolate cake to go and ate it a few days later when we felt better. The cake was really good, its pretty clear to me that this is a high quality dessert restaurant and the other food is iffy. The interior is very large, with shiny stone floors, and high ceilings. They could use a much larger waiting area, as its not unusual for them have 1-2 hour waits, also if you get a table near the door expect to be stared at by longing souls waiting for their turn. The decor is interesting; there are some Egyptian style heads on tall pillars, and lots of olive garden type art vines and flowers all over the ceiling. Also it was really chilly inside the restaurant, I left my coat on while I ate, and the women on either side of me did the same. I don't think I will ever eat at that location again however I still plan to purchase their cheesecakes off their website for gifts. You can order things to go and just pick them up which is probably a better bet and definitely a shorter wait."
Bella B.,Bay Area,0,77,,3.0,6/6/2009,"Be prepared for a wait -- sometimes up to 90 minutes. Obviously this is the place to go for cheescake :) Good appetizers, and entrees. Friendly staff."
Rambo M.,"San Francisco, CA",4,14,,2.0,2/18/2008,"I've recently visiting this place and decided to sit at the bar as the line for a table was long.     The food is great but the service has a little to be desired.  My bartender (Josh) was totally inattentive to my needs as I sat for a half hour with a empty glass and waited forever for my desert.   He had this attitude like he was doing you a favor and he's was a total SNOB.  So In that instance, the worst the service the lower the tip."
Sheena M.,"Riverside, CA",193,434,565,1.0,7/3/2007,"Come on Pleasanton! Another tired chain! How about we try a little originality please. Here we go, another deceivingly ""good"" restaurant? Why? Because they stuff you full of over-sized portions pushed by young, smiley waiters. They slap some fancy paint on the walls and boom! Pleasanton is on the map! Guess what? This is a bad restaurant. But, it doesn't matter. People will sit and wait 2 hours and beg this place ""oh please let me come, please let me give you my business"" give me a break.  But...even I was forced to venture here. And I never will again. You see, it was the first week it was open, so. We were approached by at least 15 different waiters and 20 different men in suits asking if everything was okay. Now this isn't normally something I would complain about, but it was getting absurd. I couldn't take 2 bites in a row without asking if it was okay! I can guarantee you though in a month those people wont care! So, after being rushed in and rushed out, I see that this location is like every other. Crappy."
Betty D.,"Concord, CA",95,169,11,5.0,12/16/2007,"We had a great time!  They sat us in this cool round table flanked by mirrors - we felt like we had the VIP treatment ... until our waiter dropped my cosmo all over the table.  Hey, it happens - no biggie!  We got a good laugh because of it - and a free drink later in the night.  I didn't eat but everyone elses food looked awesome.  If you're thinking about getting a salad - make sure you go with a small and plan to share it with someone - they are HUGE!!  Four of us shared two cheesecakes: CHOCOLATE OREO MUDSLIDE CHEESECAKE  and CHOCOLATE PEANUT BUTTER COOKIE-DOUGH.  YUMMMMMMMM!!!  Our waiter recommended the Key Lime Martini - skip it.  Too watery."
Chrissy F.,"Livermore, CA",8,107,,4.0,3/8/2010,"I've dined here quite a few times and had unmemorable experiences. You have to love a menu that extensive, you can always find something on the menu to match the cravings of who you are dining with.  I dined her Sunday for lunch at 2:00 and had a very memorable experience that started off poorly but quickly turned around. We had a 45 minutes wait but we expected that, no big deal We read through the menu so we'd know what we wanted to get when we sat down as to not wait longer as by 2:45 we were very hungry. As we were sat they were clearly not ready as the table was still being put together from a party that just left but no big deal. We sat down and about 2 minutes later a party of 8 was sat next to us. I see our server come over and I am thinking great let's order but she bypasses my two-top to go and greet the party and go over the menu and take their drink order. Alright..I think as this takes 5+ minutes she'll stop by and greet us when she is finished, nope walks right passed us. Then I think (I am a server) she'll ring in her drinks and come right back as they are being made, nope. She comes back and drops the drinks for the party. We've now been seated 15 minutes without a hello, my blood is now boiling at this point. She comes over and I immediately ask to see the manager and we give her our order. The manager was Fantastic to her for taking care of our issue nicely and politely, I think her name is Nancy and she was great. Made my tension with the situation fly out the window immediately.  When our food came out is was WONDERFUL. Really hit the spot. I had the Renee's special with Chicken salad sandwich, salad, and Broccoli soup. It was Delicious and my boyfriend had the club sandwich with Caesar salad and loved his as well. We had leftovers for dinner that night.  The manager at gave us a piece of cheesecake to take home on the house. We had the Key Lime, best cheesecake ever. I have never ordered the cheesecake there but can now say I will never go there without bringing a piece home from here on out. As we were leaving the manager also was kind enough to give us a gift card for a return visit...WHAT A NICE TOUCH!!! Also, during the rest of our meal our server was attentive and very sweet, so sweet that I felt guilty for talking to the manager.  We will be back!"
Jessica R.,"Livermore, CA",69,110,59,3.0,11/5/2007,"very creative and tasty appetizers, just okay main course, and difficult parking.   3.5 stars the great appetizers -spicy ahi tempura roll and the firecracker salmon roll the lacking main course - teriyaki chicken"
Julia D.,"Livermore, CA",79,68,22,4.0,4/15/2008,"We closed down the joint on a Thursday night.  I don't know what that tells you about the area.  They have large portions and excellent cheesecake.  I had the brownie sundae cheesecake. I would recommend this to anyone who likes brownies. This is a great environment for socializing and catching up with friends. I thought it was a bit expensive, but it was worth it."
Ron D.,"Dededo, Guam",483,1135,37,3.0,6/28/2009,"Went there for a mini-reunion with several Simon A. Sanchez High School Class of 85ers who live around the Bay.  This is my first time eating at The Cheesecake Factory and I always wondered what the big deal was whenever I see a line at the CF in S.F. Macys.  It must be the cheesecake, because not much else can be said about the other entrees.  The pasta carbonara I ate was too oily and did not have enough parmesan in it.  And what the heck's up with the green peas?!  Green peas and pasta just don't mix!!!"
Courtney C.,"Danville, CA",0,2,,4.0,2/17/2009,It was my very first time and it was fabulous. We went early on Saturday I mean early but it sure paid off I couldn't believe the line at 10:30am. Once the doors opened we all shuttled in like cattle moooooo.  The food was great we ordered fried calamari and the lettuce wraps what can I say about those lettuce wraps yum yum to finish up we had a piece of cheesecake and it was fantastic.  Would I go back again? Yes I'm so glad they are opening up one in Walnut Creek. if you haven't gone you should at least try it once.
David W.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,88,11,4.0,2/16/2011,"Great for brunch on weekends, but you must get their right when they open their doors. Food is good overall and comes in decent size portions. Otherwise the wait is very long. I've been to the one in SF, Walnut Creek, Newport Beach, and Irvine and the wait is always long...I guess that tells you something. Dinner is not bad as they have a few good Italian dishes."
Anna V.,"Salida, CA",0,10,1,1.0,4/27/2008,I love the Cheesecake Factory and have frequently gone to the SF and Corte Madera locations. The Pleasanton Cheesecake Factory is terrible. They lie about wait times and if you are brown skinned you can count on being sat in the worst seat available. The food is just okay when the waiters are listening well enough to get your order right. I will never go to this location again.
joe l.,"Concord, CA",0,5,,3.0,5/26/2009,"went there again since 2 years ago.   Food is good to above average. Service is acceptable, except it took almost 30 minutes for our food to arrive after we ordered.   maybe due to it was a busy weekend night. we got free drink re-fills, I guess the waitress knew we were not very happy because of the long wait for our food."
