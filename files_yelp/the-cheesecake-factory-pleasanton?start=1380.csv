T N.,"Brentwood, CA",1,39,3,3.0,1/24/2009,"Consistently reliable food, and fantastic cheesecake.  The last time I went though, we had terrible service.  It was literally a 2 hour lunch.  In either case, I'm sure I'll go back again."
Elizabeth B.,"Livermore, CA",2,107,47,2.0,10/7/2007,"I'm assuming that people go here purely for the cheesecake and not for a meal.  I ordered the Grilled Portabello on a Bun, which was actually really good.  My son ordered the Fettucini with Chicken and Sun-Dried Tomatoes.  He ate a couple bites of it, refused to eat anymore of it and filled up on bread.  I tried his pasta and could totally understand why.  It was extremely horrible.  No flavor whatsoever, unless you only eat the sun dried tomatoes.  It came in an enormous portion, but when something tastes like crap, do you really want more of it?  Honestly, Applebee's has better tasting pasta and that's not at all intended as a compliment to Applebees, as I'm not a fan of theirs either.  My husband ordered the Famous Factory Meatloaf.  I don't know why he would want to try it, but he did.  Again, a large portion, this time even presented nicely, but the food had no flavor.  Terrible, terrible.  We ordered the Chocolate Tower Truffle Cake.  Score!!  The dessert was awesome.  Need to cure your woman of PMS?  Order a slice of this for her.  It was absolutely great and one slice was good enough for the three of us.  We were determined from then on to only order desserts here from now on, and find someplace else to eat dinner.   --- Having decided to only order desserts from here, we noticed on the Cheesecake Factory's website that they offered curbside service.  Sounds convenient enough right?  All you do is call in your order, park in the designated parking spot in front of the Cheesecake Factory, call the Factory to let them know you arrived, and someone will bring out your order.  Well, we called in our order for 2 slices of cheesecake.  They told us it would be ready in 15 minutes.  We drove out to the mall, parked in their ""Curbside Service 10 minute parking"" spot 25 minutes after we phoned in our order.  Then we called to let them know we arrived.  How simple could this be?  They said they would have our order right out.  I noticed a car parked next to us.  The driver sat in his car continuously looking at his watch and looking at the Cheesecake Factory door, obviously waiting for his order to be brought out.  After waiting in my car for 10 minutes I call the Curbside Service number again to let them know my order has not been brought out yet.  ""Okay, we will let them know.""   An employee comes out with a bag of food.  Unfortunately it is not mine.  It belongs to the guy parked next to me.  She hands him the food, takes his credit card and walks back into the shop.  Okay, wth?  I've been waiting in the parking spot for 15 minutes now, I still have no cheesecake.  I don't understand why they did not take his credit card number over the phone so that when they dropped off his food, all he would have to do is sign the receipt.  The employee comes back out, helps the guy again, then walks up to my car.  Does she have my order in her hand at this time?  Nope.  She actually has the nerve to ask me, ""Are you waiting for an order?""  Believing that since she works there and should know by now that I have called in twice, I stay calm and tell her, ""Yes, it was only two slices of cheesecake.""  She tells me she'll be right back.  I wait another 10 minute and finally believing that no cheesecake is worth this long of a wait, I call the Cheesecake Factory and tell them to cancel my order.  There's no reason I should have sat in the parking lot for 25 minutes.  The employee I'm speaking to replies, ""Oh, it'll will be out there in just a minute.  They forgot to put something in your order.""  I tell him, ""How could they forget to put something in there when I only ordered 2 slices of cheesecake?  I placed my order in 50 minutes ago.  How could it take that long to cut two slices of cake and put it in a bag?"" I realize that it would have been so much easier to just walk in the shop and order the cake at the counter.  But with the way their website made it sound, curbside service really should have been a piece of cake."
Brian K.,"Fremont, CA",0,23,,3.0,12/31/2010,"Typical Cheesecake factory fare. No complaints, nothing spectacular either."
Jennifer P.,"Castro Valley, CA",0,2,,1.0,3/1/2013,"I went to Cheesecake for lunch.  My salad came out before my meal.  I immediately discovered a lettuce bug the size of a dime-with-legs on my salad and ready to eat it. I gasped loudly at seeing this healthy crawling bug on my food as well as the mere size of it. The waiter took my salad away and a manager immediately came over.  She apologized and told me and my coworker that our meals would be complimentary.  Here's the kicker.  She then continued to say that this type of bug was ""common"" to be found on lettuce and that they tend to stick to lettuce and are hard to see.  I guess she thought this information justified a bug sitting on my plate. I was so appalled by her comment and it made me even more sick to my stomach.  Needless to say, after staring at our meal for a minute or so, we left the restaurant with our food untouched. The manager just let us go and did not offer for us to come back and dine again on the house.  That is the least she could have done.  So here are my thoughts that will stick in my mind after this experience at the Cheesecake Factory: 1) Lettuce bugs are commonly found in their lettuce, 2) they definitely do not wash their lettuce thoroughly and check for these common bugs, 3) the kitchen is probably not very clean, and 4) their management staff does not have a clue on properly handling a very unpleasant customer experience.  I do not recommend the Cheesecake factory if you are looking for a good, clean, BUG-FREE dining experience."
Megan B.,"Walnut Creek, CA",4,77,1,3.0,2/6/2007,"The food is absolutely amazing and they have a great selection so it's an ideal restaurant to go to when you have a group of people with many different food preferences....but it only gets three stars because I have never come here (or any of their other locations, for that matter) without having to wait an hour to get in and unfortunately  the service tends to suffer a little as well because of the amount of people they pack in this place....but the food really is worth it in the long run, at least once and awhile. Seriously though, what kind of restaurant that has thing sort of popularity does not allow you to make reservations or at least do call ahead seating?!?!?"
Xelyn x.,"Northern, CA",36,126,3,3.0,6/18/2007,"It took a while for us to order because the menu selection is huge. The atmosphere is kinda noisy and I'm not sure what they were aiming for with their decor. The decor was a blend of gaudy Vegas (Caesars Palace) and Safari. Yeh, sort of confusing. Their portions are American sized (i.e. SUPER SIZED) But the food was really good. Make sure you're really hungery when you go otherwise be prepared to split your meal."
Weezy S.,"San Ramon, CA",3,24,,3.0,7/11/2008,"Been to this Cheesecake Factory many times - food is not outstanding, but certainly dependable enough.  If you time it right (early lunch or early dinner) you can get seated right away.  Servers are usually on the ball, though there are one or two of them that will try to skate by doing the bare minimum for you.  And look out for dirty cutlery...nothing spoils an appetite like a fork with dried food stuck between the tines. (eeew)"
Roony P.,"Fremont, CA",8,53,,3.0,4/8/2007,"I am not a major fan of the cheesecake factory at all but ""she who must be obeyd"" had a major dessert craving so we decided to swing by for lunch while shopping... I had the soup and sandwich special, she had the oreo rocky road cake.. I was full on just the soup and salad that came with the samwich but ate half, this place has HUGE portions .. decent soup..meh samwich..u cant mess-up a salad can u? it was good... the cake was good but too rich for me not really a dessert-guy... of course, i had to help finish it... :)... service was nice but kinda SLOW.... WARNING:... the white napkins shed ..and of course we wore dark pants .. white fuzzballs all up on there.. wassupwitdat...sigh.. :("
James D.,"San Ramon, CA",1,35,1,3.0,1/4/2011,"This is a picture perfect 3 star place in my opinion. A little pricey for some plates but they also have some cheaper ones. Food can come out cold and service is hit or miss. Seems like I love or I hate it never really in between. Not a bad place to grab a drink, nice full bar. I Go here about every other month."
Kyle D.,"San Francisco, CA",108,93,2,4.0,11/13/2006,"The Cheesecake Factory continues to excel with their myriad options, great-tasting food, and abundant portions.  Like the other restaurants, however, be prepared for a long wait - so get there early, put your  name in, go shopping, come back...wait some more...then eat.  Surprisingly, once my family was seated, service was very fast, although it was still apparent that the staff was still trying to get into the swing-of-things.  Overall, it was a great experience, except for the long wait beforehand."
Victoria N Tino W.,"Beverly Hills, CA",2,16,,3.0,9/16/2010,"we went there on a wednesday night, we were told there was a 10 minute wait although it turned out more like 1/2 an hour to a 1/2 empty place. i ordered the garlic noodles w/ shrimp which was very dry and plain, mostly all noodles which some was clumped together. other than that it was alright compared to a far more superior s.f. downtown cheesecake factory, better cooks maybe???"
Katherine H.,"Tracy, CA",41,62,,2.0,8/26/2007,"Why do people love this place so much? It's always always always busy - staggering wait times.  The food is fine, but nothing I would wait for an hour for.   I went with family to eat there on a Weds night at 6. Not my choice to eat there.  Yep - staggering wait.  They said it would be 15 minutes.  It was 45.  I had two young kids with me so it felt like 2 hours!  The food is fine - I got the crabcake sandwich, my standby.  My mom and dh got some kind of tuna dish which they both really liked. My biggest gripe is how completely UN KID FRIENDLY this place is. They obviously cater to families since there are always families there.  Yet - no kids menu.  No crayons.  Nothing. Oh - and the service.  B - A - D.  Our food took forever.  The server claimed it wasn't her fault because she couldn't get someone to carry it out with her.  Um...that's just stupid."
Matt M.,"Dublin, CA",6,121,13,3.0,3/30/2009,"Cheesecake factory represents conflict for me when I think about my dining options. It's one of the few places I'll consider going to with stipulations attached. I like most of the food, I find it to be a decent meal at a decent price and more times that not, usually tastes pretty good. I've come to really enjoy their Jumbalaya when it's available, some of their asian themed dishes aren't too bad (sweet and sour chicken is alright) and I had a really good pulled pork sandwich the other night. The Pleasanton location is fairly clean, we've always had good servers there and it's only five minutes away from my house (sure closer than driving to Valley Fair or BART to SF).  As I mentioned though, the stipulations sometimes outweigh the benefits.  1. I'm a beer nut and their draft selections stink. Only 3 beers on tap? You have 764 (just a guess) things on your menu... 2. The wait...I refuse to wait longer than 15 minutes for any restaurant and this place is ridiculous at times. I've called in before to inquire about wait time and told it would be 3, YES 3, hours to get a table.  And to top it off, all of those other people waiting 3 hours are hanging out around the bar or entrance which is very small space. 3. You can find better food at most other places. Cheesecake factory has a strong collection of ""good dishes"" but none of them are truly great. You go there when a different member of your family wants Mexican, Italian, asian, seafood, or a burger and no one is willing to compromise.  By having to make so many dishes ok-good, they really fail to make anything spectacular. The desert is good, but before you make the trek, consider what type of food you want and I'll bet you end up going somewhere that will make a meal that will be fantastic instead of just ok. Trust me!"
greg k.,"Fremont, CA",1,21,,1.0,1/13/2009,"I've eaten at the cheescake factory in Boston, Palo Alto and this Pleasanton location. The stoneridge location has featured the worst food and service by far. Let me say that the Cheescake Factory has never impressed me with their food and relative prices. Their menu is deep, however the few times I've eaten there I seem to always be unsure about what to order. I've had one positive experience at the stoneridge location and two negative ones. Here's the deal: I ate here a couple of weeks ago. My girlfriend and I ordered sandwiches, It took them 40 minutes to bring out our food. I know that they were busy, but seriously, 40 minutes for two sandwiches? My shrimp BLT was completely screwed up. The fries were drenched with salt and the sandwich was lathered with sauce. The worst atrocity was the fact that there were just a few pieces of dead looking shrimp in the sandwich. Mind you, my one positive experience here came from this shrimp blt so I was extremely dissapointed with what seemed like a lousy, effortless rendition by the kitchen staff. My food was sent back, the manager agreed about the pitiful state of the sandwich and told me he would take it off our bill. i walked out of there thinking I'll never eat at a Cheescake Factory again. I share the same sentiments with other reviewers, too much staff, service is slow, overpriced, and most importantly, the food is unimpressive. With a P.F Chang's right next door at this particular location it's a no brainer. Avoid this place."
Rebecca O.,"Livermore, CA",13,15,12,3.0,1/15/2011,"i give it three stars because of the location (right at the mall), their food, and the nice layout of the place. i hate that you cannot make reservations, which makes it difficult if you want to go there on a special occasion. i went there last year for my anniversary, and we had to wait an hour, so we ended up just waiting in our car because it was cold out, and i was dressed up with five inch heels so i didn't feel like walking around the mall. also for my dad's birthday we tried coming here on a weekend night which is of course going to be crazy and they told us the wait time for 8 people including two kids was going to be three hours! no fun! well once our whole party got there, we went up to the girls at the front and told her our party was here and if we could get on the list and she said sure ten minutes!! we were like really???? ok!! so there we are waiting and after about 15 minutes we went up to her again and asked if we were next and she was like huh??!! we told her that she just told us about 15 minutes ago it would only be 10 minutes because i thought a table big enough for us had opened. then she says oops i thought you guy were someone else, my bad! dumb hoe! so then she was like still a three hour wait for you then. omg we waited there for no reason, plus my kids were hungry, so i was upset! so we ended up having to go to chevys and i felt bad because it was my dad's bday. i didn't expect the wait to be short, but dumb girls that work there, don't be dumb telling people 10 minutes if it's really 3 hours and have us sitting there waiting like idiots wasting our time! please managers there, hire girls who actually pay attention to what they are doing instead of gossiping with fellow airheaded co-workers. my dad said he will NEVER go there again, and will be letting many people know the same thing!"
Angellica Y.,"San Francisco, CA",18,202,36,2.0,1/12/2009,"I like the one located on top of Macy's in San Francisco better, but the wait time is always so long. The wait time was actually just as long when we went to the Pleasanton location. The weird thing about the restaurant that weekend before Christmas was that the floor was super slippery...weird!!! We saw five people walk by our booth and almost slipped and fell. That would have been a huge law suit. Ironically, when my chicken dish came out, I took my first bite of the chicken that was smothered with cheese and sauces, and after chewing it into bits and pieces, I realized it was totally UNCOOKED. I just swallowed a piece of raw chicken, ahhh!!!! I immediately lost my appetite and almost threw up - it was really, really bad. I was super hungry too, so I was pretty frustrated. The manager tried to show that he cared and offered to make a new plate, but it was too late and I didn't want to eat anything there. He gave us a complimentary dish of strawberry shortcake, which I nibbled on, but I just wanted to leave after that. Too bad the chicken was raw because the food looked really good on the outside and it was a huge portion that I would have completely devoured."
ConstantlyEating A.,"San Jose, CA",10,36,,4.0,6/4/2007,"CheeseFactory in Pleasanton A real 1 hr. 45 min wait on Saturday? It can't be.  It was.  My sis had to drive out & wait in the parking lot an hour in advance of our truckload of hungry mouths.  In a party of 6, 4 adults & 2 kids we got there & what's cool about waiting is you get to people watch. CF isn't formal or anything.  I went in flipflops, but some folks were dressed up like they were hitting the club afterwards.  The staff was totally cool with the waiting bodies throughout the wait, the seating & the end were all VERY cool.  Steve checked on us constantly & was a good server.  We got the appetizer sampler & this was one of the best ever.  Usually there a couple of foods that are left behind but we KILLED. The guac eggrolls (it's really ALL guac), the crab fried won tons, the pot stickers, my kids killed the delicious squid, just everything except the drab quesadillas all were excellent.  That's pretty damn good for my family who won't eat stuff just because it's left behind.  We ordered a pizza, the chicken madeira, mac & cheese for the kids & 2 hibachi steaks & we were all very happy.  CF has decent sized portions which I was worried about because too little on my plate drives me bonkers.  I could have easily wiped out my dish but I saved it for dessert which isn't normal for me.  I guess waiting in front of the cheesecake displays for my table paid dividends.  I went with the Oreo mudpie cheesecake,  someone else got the cherry one & the dulce  & someone else got the craig's carrot cake style.  I wanted a glass of milk  for mine, it was so rich.   We left a dish in the middle of the table of the excess whip cream but we loved our cheesecake desserts.  I had a bad experience at the CF in Las Vegas years ago, my sister's taking me here for my bday has brought me back."
Bay A.,"Walnut Creek, CA",4,42,3,3.0,6/19/2007,Food is great!  Cheesecake is great!  The service is so so!  The 2 hour wait sucks ass!  The hour wait for the food sucks even more ass!   I just love their meatloaf.  For that alone Im sure I will be back.  I just have to prepare myself mentally for the long wait ahead of me.
Jazzy Girl D.,"Hayward, CA",1,19,,5.0,5/18/2010,"Love everything here...nice atmoshere, drinks and food. Me and a friend have dinner here most Sundays"
Shyer L.,"Sunnyvale, CA",117,61,2,3.0,9/24/2008,"For my first time here, I was so excited to have the Macaroni and Cheese Balls, the Porkchops with Applesauce, and of course, Cheesecake.  2 out of 3 isn't bad.  I ended up having a Filet Mignon for my entree. Overall, the food is decent, definitely worth returning to try the Porkchops (if they have them next time).  What they are losing a star for is the service.  It's been a pattern that I have been noticing with larger chain restaurants.   I am assuming that it has to do with all the lawsuits these days from employees that have claimed that they don't get their appropriate breaks at the appropriate time.  We had 3 different servers while we were here, each one relieving the other for a break.  I don't like this.  It is very confusing for me to know who I need to have eye contact with when something is needed.  And it took them so long to take our order, and then even longer to come back to tell us that they were out of what I had ordered.  Maybe it was an off night, but they weren't very busy so I can't imagine why we had to wait so long, other than the fact that one of the servers dropped the baton during the relay.  I'm sure we'll give them another shot, but for now my rating stays where it is."
