Tuan T.,"Oakland, CA",15,7,34,2.0,1/15/2017,"Having been here an abundant amount of times, I could say without a doubt that the food is mediocre and the service much less. After 5:00 PM, there are no reservations available so expect a delay depending on your party size. From my personal experience, with small groups it is usually an hour to two hour wait and with larger groups, expect upwards of three hours. Even after you are seated, it takes approximately another hour for them to take your order and prepare the food. Do not come here expecting quality food and exceptional service because that's never going to happen, rather come here to spend time with friends and family."
Rita B.,"Bakersfield, CA",7,130,84,4.0,2/20/2017,"I have been here a number of times when staying at the nearby Sheraton, as this is just across the street in the Stoneridge Mall.  It's always packed, but you can usually score a free seat at the bar.  I come for dinner during happy hour.  Their prices are terrific, as well as the drink choices.  My favorite is the zucchini fries, coated with crispy parmesan.  The serving they give you is enormous, and you get a basket of bread on the side no matter what you order.  An appetizer or two plus a drink sets you back only about $20.  The wait staff is always friendly, and service reasonably fast considering how busy they are."
Danika P.,"San Leandro, CA",364,329,1191,3.0,2/19/2017,"Came here to dine in with my sisters for cheesecake factory's half of a slice for national cheesecake day. According to their promotion it was for dine in only, but we noticed people were ordering cheesecake to go which was misleading. Anyways, we waited about an hour an half to be seated so we decided to take our time with our meal. We ordered the loaded baked potato bites and loved it! We also had several baskets of the complimentary bread since the kitchen was backed up. I ordered the chicken biscuit and shared it with one of my sisters. My other sister ordered the angel pasta. As for cheesecake I ordered their new nutella drizzled cheesecake and it was DELICIOUS! Words cannot express how amazing it was. I was already full and if I wasn't full I would have gotten my own slice. Instead I shared it with my sister. It literally tasted like the ferrero rocher chocolate. It was rich and sweet. I honestly can say that this is my new favorite cheesecake aside from the pumpkin and vanilla. Service was as good as it can get since it was super busy, so I understand. Food was good. I will definitely will be back here for more amazing food and cheesecake. I highly recommend people to give this restaurant a try and order the nutella cheesecake. It's like diabetes on a plate, but worth it."
Melanie W.,"Pittsburg, CA",78,76,34,2.0,1/12/2017,"The cheesecake is fabulous but I can't say that about much else! It's all SO overpriced and I will never, ever go there again for lunch... service is incredibly slow, the lunch specials are quite pricey and the food is bland as hell. Not sure what's happened but CCFs in general have gone way down in quality over the years."
Beverly J.,"Pleasanton, CA",0,2,,1.0,9/5/2017,Ok always LOVE Cheesecake Factory in Pleasanton  Ordered thru DoorDash and got order delivered very quickly 5 prawns with a handful of pasta. Called today and spoke with manager Jennifer and she stated that I would need to contact DoorDash and get reimbursed (REALLY ). How is DoorDash responsible for the portion of food?  I go to cheese cake factory frequently and what I received yesterday seems to be a kids menu. So what do you go in person to make sure you get the correct portion?  Again why would I contact DoorDash?  They're not responsible for portions
Cindy C.,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",114,441,146,3.0,12/9/2016,"+/- THE FOOD The Cheesecake Factory is one of the best chain restaurants there is but at the end of the day, it is just a chain restaurant. The food here is always of huge portions and really flavorful (maybe too much?). My go-to's here are the pastas or any fish/chicken dishes. One of my favorite appetizers is the avocado eggrolls. If you don't like cooked warm avocado, you won't like it. However, its rich buttery avocado flavor and its sauce is perfect for me.  - THE WAIT There is ALWAYS a wait here, no matter what day you come in or at what time. Since it's a part of the mall, this place is always packed and you will always have to park far."
Cristi F.,"North Las Vegas, NV",5,4,2,1.0,3/23/2017,"Horrible customer service. Especially from someone named Jessica who ""claims"" to be a manager but won't take ownership on the restaurants quality of food. After 15 minutes on hold, there was ZERO acknowledgement of my concern and then, she said ""this conversation is over"" and hung up on me.  Stand by your food. And your service. Jessica. Buh bye."
Macklin And Heather T.,"Pleasanton, CA",0,28,132,2.0,4/8/2017,Have you ever seen moss grow on a tree?... because that's how slow this cheesecake factory is!! After first being told that it would be about 30 minutes before we were seated (It actually took an hour) Once we were seated we didn't see a waiter for 15 minutes. The food took well over an hour and a half to arrive. We had to get it to go and eat it later because we had already been at the restaurant for 3 hours and 40 min!! Not worth the wait...
Kassandra T.,"Larkspur, CA",3,13,12,2.0,7/4/2017,"This has probably been my worst experience at the Cheesecake Factory ever. Came on 7/4 which is a holiday so maybe that could be the reason for such poor service, But our server (did not get her name because she never introduced herself) who was very sweet just could not keep up. We were sat in the bar area and it was painful watching our server apologizing to our surrounding tables. It was just busy and I don't think the hosts were seating with enough of a grace period for her to fully catch up. When we were sat another table next to us was also sat in her section & I overheard her taking the drink order for the table just right next to us. Understanding that it was really busy we just waited with no complaint until she finally got to us but unfortunately she never did, after 20 minutes she sent over her manager (who I think should have done more to help her really, like buss tables, refilled drinks, etc) he apologized for the wait and told us he was just starting us until she could get around to coming over. When we finally order he said we had just missed Happy Hour, I looked at my phone and it was now 6:06. After explaining our long wait to the manager he honored the happy our price, we ordered our food and then waited another 30 for the food to come out.  The server apologized over and over then began to blame the kitchen. I guess my overall reason for this post is YOU GUYS ARE A TEAM!   The host failed the server then, the manager failed the server by not providing enough follow up, & last the server failed the kitchen by bad mouthing them.  Find a new game plan cheesecake, preshift meetings or something. Won't be back for a while."
Kathy O.,"Livermore, CA",48,23,7,1.0,7/3/2017,"HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!   Took forever to get food and we had 3 kids 7, 5 & 3.. asked for manager he said ""we're busy"" waited 40 minutes for food and they served the kids last! Then another 45 minutes for Cheesecake & ice cream!!! Used to love it here but attitude of waitress will make me think twice! Manager just came and said he would take off kids meals and desserts. Food was great once we got it!"
Ricky W.,"East Bay, CA",265,150,2719,4.0,9/16/2015,"Great time at the factory....    I havent been to a cheesecake factory in years and I feel personally they have gotten so much better over the years, menu and the resteraunt as a whole.    Today I came with a good friend to release some stress and shop a bit. I ordered the Jamaican Black pepper shrimp and it was so good and flavorful. I struggled between Salmon and shrimp, and chose well. My friend ordered the Chicken Madeira at our waiters reccomendation which she very much enjoyed. We also had the Firecracker Salmon as an appetizer which was super tasty.    I ordered a shot of tequila and the ultimate margarita with was pretty good, but our waiter reccomended a well mannered martini for my friend which she detested (she isnt a drinker at all and said there was no liquor in it). Lol, I dont drink martinis but the face she made when she sipped that drink make me try it...it tastes like ice and olive juice, I couldnt even drink it and I dont believe in wasting liquor. The waiter had the bar remake the drink and it was no different.The waiter asked my friend if she wanted another drink, she ordered another drink and enjoyed it. We were still charged for the ""filthy"" martini which was almost untouched so I downed it. Gross!    All in all I had a really good time, the food was great and our waiter was a cool kat with some pretty cool artwork on his arms that was attentive and not afraid to interact or suggest things. I will be back to this location again and will try to come alot more often after this experience. Cheers to the Cheesecake factory and our server Chavarus!!!! Didnt make 5 stars because the Well mannered Martini proved to be ill mannered."
Karen C.,"San Jose, CA",163,507,424,4.0,1/25/2016,"My friends and I had lunch here recently and really enjoyed ourselves.  We got there early, at 11am, and the place already had a line.  But they seated us within about 5 minutes.  I guess everyone else had the same idea about getting their early to avoid the crowd. It did take a bit of time for our waitress to come by but once she did, she was attentive the rest of our time there.  She took our drink and food order and came back pretty quickly with our drinks and bread. For entrees, I had the Super Antioxidant Salad - Salad Greens, Spinach, Kale, Avocado, Broccoli, Grapes, Roasted Pear, Blueberries, Onion, Sunflower Seeds and Almonds with Lemon-Blueberry Vinaigrette.  It was delicious.  So filling and filled with yummy stuff. My friends had the avocado egg rolls, baked potato soup and orange chicken lunch special.  Everything was done to our liking.  My friends really enjoyed their food. We also did dessert.  I had the carrot cake as I can't eat a lot of diary.  So no cheesecake for me.  We friends had cheesecake.  We all liked our dessert.  the carrot cake was not too heavy and had a nice frosting on top.  Lots of nuts on the side.  Yum! I definitely will be back here as my friends and I shop at the mall often."
Lauren V.,"San Ramon, CA",97,134,801,5.0,5/19/2016,"Although it takes a long time to wait for a table, it's so worth it. On a Wednesday night, it took 30 minutes to get a table, which actually wasn't as bad as I've experienced waiting 2 hours for a table on a Friday night. Setting: If you've ever been to another Cheesecake Factory, it looks pretty much the same. Fairly large, lots of seating in booths and tables. I like that each table is pretty private, so it feels more secluded to your group. There's also outside seating for warm days. Service: AMAZING. My party was at the restaurant for over 3 hours, and our waitress didn't even try to rush us (which she probably should have, because so many people were waiting for a table).  Food: Honestly, you can't go wrong with anything. The menu is extensive and sometimes seems think of frightening, but whatever you pick will be good. I personally love the pastas, which are HUGE and always serve as leftovers for the next day! Also, the macaroni and. cheese balls (they are exactly what they sound like) are to die for! Sadly, I don't like cheesecake, so I don't have an opinion on that.  EAT THE BREAD. But not too much. You're bound to fall in love with the brown bread and end up not wanting to eat the real meal."
Tatiana G.,"San Leandro, CA",169,40,18,4.0,8/2/2017,"Good service and good food. We sat at the bar due to the wait for a table, and we're served by the bartender. Friendly and attentive, in spite of the busy environment. Menu's a little overwhelming, but it was still cool."
Angela P.,"San Ramon, CA",202,12,1,4.0,8/22/2017,"I've been here countless times and every experience is good. The servers are always nice and always checking in. The food is good, I always get the fresh grilled salmon. Their drinks are delicious, I recommend you try the peach Bellini, it's so yummy that you wouldn't even know there's alcohol in it! I took off a star just because it does take a while for you to receive your food. The wait to be seated is long enough. My friend jokes around saying the food is probably so good because you're starved by the time it arrives lol. But good food overall!"
user o.,"Sunnyvale, CA",3,2,,2.0,10/27/2017,"I love Cheesecake Factory food, they are my kids favorite food, but everytime we go here they always make mistake on our order. And we have to wait 20 and another 20-30 min to get the reAl order. My poor son was sooooo starving and eating my food instead even though it was spicy. The crew are nice but can't help my self venting out specially if one of  kid gets cranky beCause they are hungry. I hope they can make it faster next time and pay more attention on what we order."
Jackson G.,"Castro Valley, CA",156,109,77,4.0,1/30/2017,"This place was the first cheesecake factory I have ever been to. Ever since then I've become a fan of their restaurant. This place is located at a mall so there is a lot of parking spaces. However, waiting can be a challenge. The lines are always long and you will most likely need to wait to be seated. I always get the Louisiana Pasta Chicken. It's just my Go-To dish and I love it! The chicken is always crispy and I love eating the butterfly shaped pasta. Very cheesy and flavorful. Occasionally I will try their steak and mash potatoes! Their steak is always tender and juicy and their mash potatoes have a lot of seasoning along with the steak sauce! Very enjoyable! Did I mention the free bread and butter in the beginning? Most likely the best free bread you will ever get. Every time I come here I look forward to their bread. They are always fresh and warm and tastes extremely good! But I need to be careful not to get full from bread before the main course haha! I never had a problem with customer service here before. They are always fast and efficient! Although during busy hours it might take a while to get their attention but they will definitely get the job done. I've eaten a couple of their cheesecakes and man they are the best!! I have a huge sweet tooth and the cheesecake is usually a have to have in this place! Sometimes I will be full from the bread and main course so I won't have room for cheesecake but I recommend the Oreo cheesecake! It's my favorite! All in all, this place made a lot of memories for me since I live nearby. i would definitely come back and get some more of that bread and cheesecake!"
Wayne S.,"Hemet, CA",0,8,,5.0,4/16/2017,We got prompt friendly service and really enjoyed our meal. My wife and I will be planning trips to that mall so we can eat there again. The price was right and the variety was matchless.
Patricia C.,"Santa Maria, CA",78,23,3,1.0,6/24/2017,"Let me begin with this is my first time here to this particular Cheesecake Factory , brought a friend of mine to eat, we got seated quickly which was nice our Meal took a long time to arrive my friend even went up to the front desk and said something, everyone around us who arrived after us got their order before us , and when it did arrive the lettuce that was on the side for my turkey burger was very brown and wilted so I told the waiter then she comes back with Cabbage like really since when do we put cabbage on a burger , So I take a few bites of my turkey burger and it was Not good at all couldn't even eat it, I'm not one to complain but boy I told the manager I was not happy I still expected to pay for both our meals oh did I mention my friend was not happy with her burger , The only nice thing that came out of this is we didn't have to pay but like I mentioned before I didn't have a problem paying so there you have it. I'll continue to go to the one at Valley Fair Mall. P.s. My friend did leave a $5 tip why I don't know."
Scott S.,"Elk Grove, CA",147,197,215,4.0,6/5/2016,"I have a complicated history with this place. I have many a wonderful meal here. The food is always good. I actually get a different plate each time and only been disappointed on two occasions. The service is hit or miss my favorite waitress just left for the Los Angeles area and she will be missed. The bar staff is always friendly and fast Tonight I had the garlic noodles and they were insane. The pasta was a percent al dente and the sauce was perfect. Now it is not a good date night dish as there is a ton of garlic, which is a good thing. The asparagus was a bit over cooked, but seasoned well.  I highly recommend this dish. I did not add a protein, yet you can add chicken or shrimp. The desert was delicious. The Oreo s'more was hypnotic. I love burnt marshmallow and chocolate. I do wish the crust was a little thicker.  Happy eating."
