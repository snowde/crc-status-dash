food lover t.,"Fremont, CA",1,138,,1.0,9/22/2010,ordered chicken medallions.....chicken was dried and rice is cold.  services is terrible.  waittress saw me waved at her and she ignored me.
jesse e.,"Daly City, CA",0,21,,1.0,1/7/2009,I've heard great things about cheesecake factory.  Over-rated to just plain bad.  My kids found the food inedible and that's saying something for teenage boys.  You gets lots of food but its just not very good food.  The service was great.
Theresa C.,"Dublin, CA",0,41,,1.0,6/28/2008,We had a couple of good lunches here so decided to try it for dinner. Mistake!! The wait was as stated - 15  minutes - but the table was crammed in the middle of the bank of tables in the bar. We asked for something in the dining room but that would have been another 15-20 minutes. This was at 5:00PM. The service was extremely slow & the waitress could not be heard over the din. The tables around us were served first even though they were seated after us - the waiters around us seemed to be flipping tables quickly. We ordered combination plates with steak and fish. The meat was not done correctly - what was supposed to be medium rare medallions looked like scraps of meat that ranged from well done to raw. The meat was cold and the potatoes covered most of the plate. The fish was fine but for the price we will try the Elephant Bar now open in Dublin.
Ann W.,"Pleasanton, CA",5,75,9,1.0,9/7/2008,"I've been to this location a couple times before & had a good experience - good food & services.  My husband & I went on Friday night with a large group and it was bad...particularly for my husband.  He ordered the kobe burger...when he bit into it, it was RAW.  I don't mean rare, I really mean raw.  The waitress saw it & agreed (pretty hard for her not to agree) and took it back.  It came back the second time, he bit into it, and it was still raw...the exact same.  Sent it back the 3rd time (by the this time, everyone at our table was done eating & husband didn't even want the damn burger) and when it came out, he lifted the bun up and it was basically ground beef.  The had been 'trying' to re-cook the same patty, so by this time it had been cut into so many times that it was pieces!  The waitress agreed (sort of) and said she would have a new one made - to-go.  At this point, even the to-go burger wasn't going to be eaten by us....you've all seen those behind the scenes shows and/or movies that show what cooks really do to your food when you send it back.  Anyway, it was a bad experience.  Good thing the over priced cheesecake is good.  Won't be going back here for a while."
Samantha T.,"Tracy, CA",0,1,,1.0,2/14/2012,"If I could give this place no stars at all I would. Our waitress took our order.. I ordered the ""stuffed chicken tortillas"" and my fiance ordered the filet. Eventually, our food comes out..my fiance's dish was right, but  I look at mine and they are taquitos... I'm not the type of person that sends back food but it wasn't close to the dish I had ordered. So I politely tell the waitress this actually wasn't what I ordered and that I ordered the stuffed chicken tortillas. She thought I said ""taquitos"" so she took it away and said that my dish will be coming up shortly. I just had a feeling, and was worried that they were going to do something to it. So finally it came and I was inspecting it and there it was... a huge HAIR!!! and not just a regular hair, a PUBE!!!!!! it was so disgusting!!!! I let our waitress know and told her I didn't want to pay for this and that we just wanted the check. She didn't even seem that shocked or anything so we knew it was on purpose and knew it was there!! The manager came over and did a half a** apology and kept asking if I wanted anything else... ummm nooo, so you could do more stuff to it??? i don't think so!!! We were so disgusted and just wanted to leave.. they still charged us for our drinks and my fiance's meal which was sooo lame!! We were very disappointed in the way they handled everything and we will never go back there again!!!! So disgusting!!!!"
Nicholas D.,"San Lorenzo, CA",2,18,,3.0,8/9/2008,"I would've given this place 5 stars but the service was TERRIBLE if you ask me. It somehow took us 30 minutes for our waitress to take our order, and she kept having these trainees switch for her. we saw one of the trainees get in her car and bounce (we were seated outside), and we were all like wtf? Jenny comes with our food, and I'm not gonna lie, it was hella good! Our total was $82 so we gave her a $100. She came back and asked if we wanted our change- FOR BAD SERVICE LIKE THAT? She's lucky she pocketed $5."
Loren S.,"Duluth, GA",0,14,,1.0,9/10/2008,"What a birthday dinner disappointment!  The chicken and biscuits was a tasteless glob of yuck, and the meatloaf had massive amounts of sage.  Overwhelming and inedible.  The atmosphere on a Saturday afternoon was a bit loud and there was a 30 minute wait, but I was prepared for that, and our server was very good.  Attentive, friendly, and helpful.  But none of that makes up for bad food.  Too many better places to eat to ever go back here."
Jennifer W.,"Livermore, CA",0,8,,3.0,8/12/2008,"OK.... I hate to complain cause their food is so good, but DON'T TELL ME THE WAIT IS ONLY 25-30 MINUTES and then make us wait for an hour.  I even had to go back and make sure we were still on the list.  Seriously, their food is always on-point but the wait is just too long.  However, the server was awesome so my experience was not too bad.  If you don't mind the wait, the food sorta makes up for it so..."
Jeff S.,"Pleasanton, CA",4,20,,4.0,8/13/2009,"The food here has always been very good.  I especially like the Monte Cristo's at Sunday brunch.  My favorite dishes for dinner are Crusted Chicken Romano and Orange Chicken.  The Kobe Burger is also very good.  The service is usually pretty good, and occasionally great.  We have had 2 ""lousy"" service situations, but most of the time it's acceptable or better.  This 'Factory is especially popular since it hasn't been open that long and the food is consistently good - so be prepared to wait.  Tip: If there are 4 or less in your party, you can snag a look in the bar area for an empty table - they are first come, first served.  Tip#2: If you go to this 'Factory for dinner, and you don't like being cold, DON'T sit outside unless we are in the middle of a major heat spell.  Even with the outdoor heaters, the chilly Pleasanton breeze that shows up nearly every evening will freeze you right to the bone.  Ask me how I know..."
Jason E.,"Geneva, IL",53,33,3,1.0,1/3/2009,"This place has gone down hill.  The wait staff was terrible!  It took our waiter about 10 minutes to even approach our table and take our drink orders - another 5 minutes to come back with drinks.  Then  he disappeared and never came back to take our food orders.  About 15 minutes later another waiter shows up and tells us he's our new waiter and takes our orders.  He never brings us refills and disappears too.  About 40 minutes later he shows back up with another waitress and announces that he's going on break and she'll be taking care of us.  We asked about or food and some refills - she brings us some refills and tells us that it will be a little longer for the food.  Finally, the food shows up - delivered by a 4th person who tells us to be careful the plates are hot.  Sitting under the heat lamps for who knows how long...  The food was ""eehhhh"" - okay.  $19.95 for a lunch portion of Mahi-Mahi - a tad pricey for what you get - broiled fish on top of mashed potatoes.  If we didn't have my 85 year old grandmother with us, we would have walked out of there in the beginning.  We won't be back."
Ryan P.,"San Ramon, CA",0,16,,2.0,3/26/2007,"This place is f-ing ridiculous! First of all, there was a 2.5 hour wait. We decided to have a drink at the bar. Waited for 15 mins, and the bartender didn't even acknowledge us. We turned in our pager do-hickey, left, and have no plans to return."
Kelly H.,"Foster City, CA",19,36,3,5.0,11/25/2008,"The lunch menu has really generous portions = so cool! I went with two girlfriends for lunch and cheesecake. We waited maybe 15 minutes on a Saturday at 12:30 which is awesome. Our waiter made great recommendations. You knid of are overwhelmed with the massive amount of choices on the menu, so asking for help sorta sped up the decision making process. Two of us had yummy Pasta Carbonara lunchand the other had the Shepherd's Pie lunch... and all dishes were hot, delicious and served with a smile. Can I say that I wish they would serve the lunch portion sizes at dinner too? I always feel like I am wasting food when their dinner are enough for three meals LOL. But I would be remiss if I didn't DROOL over the cheesecake. I have had several flavors, of the dulce de leche, the chocolate chip, the new york style, the mud pie one etc... but this time I had the Oreo Cookie Cheesecake. A little overdone on the whip cream topping. But after scraping that off, you are left with cheesecake heaven! The oreo cookie crust, the creamy creamy cheesecake with the bits of oreo throughout was simply fantastic! We will be going back again :)"
Laurie S.,"Castro Valley, CA",116,277,2,4.0,5/27/2007,"I am so super happy and giddy that the Cheesecake Factory is in Pleasanton!!! After eating yummy meals at the one in San Francisco, and then again in Las Vegas, I was anxious for this one to open. I cannot get enough of the Cajun Jumbalaya Pasta and the Coconut Chocolate Cream Cheescake. Yummy Yummy Yummy!!!  We've been 4 times since they opened. The first time we went around 11am and were seated immediately! Service was quick and excellent! The second time we went around 1pm and waited 40 minutes for a table (5 people including a toddler). They were very busy, so service was a little slower, but great waiter.  The third time we waited 1 1/2 hours around 6pm. Luckly we had some shopping to do to pass the time, while another member of our party waited with the buzzer thing and called us as soon as it buzzed.  They originally told us 2 1/2 hour wait, so we were pleasantly suprised by the quicker seating.  The last time we went, we just went to get cheesecake to go.  I thought it was kind of odd that I had to go up to the counter, order the cheesecake. pay, and then wait 15 minutes for them to have my order ready. I mean the cheesecakes were sitting right there in front of me. WTH?  Just cut the cheesecake and send me on my way. It shouldn't have taken 15 minutes to get 2 slices of cheesecake to go.  Love that they have valet parking...it's a godsend when your 8 months preggo and don't feel like walking from the other end of the parking lot.  Wouldn't normally use it otherwise, but it's super nice to know it's there just in case!"
Irene C.,"Alameda, CA",163,185,150,3.0,11/2/2007,"It used to be such a treat to go to Cheesecake Factory whenever we made LA roadtrips...now I just feel it's a bit tired since it's exploded all over the Bay Area.  Every time I look at the menu, it is a bit overwhelming.  Too many options to choose from that I end up ordering the same old thing.  In any case, I guess it's good for variety...and good for crowds, but the wait is a pain in the ass.  After 7:30pm on a Monday night...and we had to wait for a table for 15 minutes.  Walk in...and uh...yeah...there's empty tables around us.  What??  Hmm...ok, so maybe I didn't see folks leave before we got there...or maybe there's just not enough wait staff to handle a full house on a Monday night.  Or MAYBE there's a strategy to always make people wait a little bit, because there's always a crowd by the door.  Reminds me of my days going clubbing...you know...where the club should be open already and it takes FOREVER to get in.  Hence the line would get longer, and make passersby think THIS is the place to be!  Anyways...shared appetizer of Spinach Artichoke dip, which ended up being mostly Spinach.  I chose the Spicy Cashew Chicken for my entree, which was alright.  Be sure to save at least half your meal for take-home if you want a piece of cheesecake.  I had the Dulce de Leche cheesecake which was AWESOME."
mel m.,"Danville, CA",37,115,59,1.0,3/17/2009,"i always hear such great things about the cheesecake factory i was excited when i finally went with some friends. the wait was long but that was expected. what wasn't expected was the awful service. right away the waiter took our drink orders and then, who knows where he went. oh wait, i know, to wait on everyone else but us. while i was waiting for my water i had a coughing attack (i was getting over being sick that weekend). i got the waiters attention to ask if he could bring my water right away please, between coughing and gasping for breaths. a minute later he comes with a tray of drinks. ALL for the tables around us. and i'm still coughing and its only getting harder to catch my breath. i finally had to go to the bar to get my own water! and then when the food finally came, with our drinks, it was only mediocre. not such a great intro to such a popular restaurant. i'm still scratching my head at what all the hype is..."
michelle l.,"Pleasanton, CA",0,3,,5.0,10/7/2008,i had a wonderful experience and this location. everyone was genuinely very nice and considerate. the food took a while but i expected that as is such a large restaurant. the service was really great and i would definitly go again.
Trinity X.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",5,110,1,3.0,6/8/2007,"I'll give it only 3 stars as it's only worth going for the cake selection. If your intention is eating there, you'll wait forever on a weekend and the food really isn't spectacular, you're better off elsehwere..Try the neighboring PF Chang's for food, that is if you get through their long lines.  As for the cakes, I favor many, among them the Tiramisu Cheesecake and Tres leche Cheesecake. The slices are big and yummy. The price is a bit much tho, but it's open late and accessible when my local bakery isn't."
James P.,"San Ramon, CA",1,16,,2.0,4/26/2009,"The service at this Cheesecake Factory used to be better, but it really really sucks now.  I went there for Happy Hour yesterday at about 4:30pm.  I sat at a high table in the bar which was cleaned off and furnished with place settings immediately by one of the bus boys.  Then, I waited 10 minutes for on of the waitresses to come by and take my drink order.  I don't know what it is with the wait staff at this place, they congregate at the corner of the bar and chit chat while people are clearly waiting to be helped.  Finally got my drink, then had to ask for a menu.  I assumed they would bring me a happy hour menu, but no they brought a regular menu, had to ask for the happy hour menu which took them another five minutes to bring.  After I got the happy hour menu, the waitress badgered me every two minutes to order.  The food was decent for the price, but the service is so frustratingly sucky."
jessica a.,"Fremont, CA",1,6,,5.0,2/1/2010,"My gf and I went out to Oakland thinking we can find a restaurant and have a nice dinner..all we could find are bars and nasty   we are driving around end up in Orinda don't ask me how, come back down and I say in frustration lets just go to a Cheesecake Factory dammit!It kind of sucks that there are limited restaurants in the bay and have to drive 25 miles to get to it from Fremont.But as always its worth it!It was a Saturday 10:15pm we find one in Pleasanton yay! We sat at our table with no wait =] and our server was Nicole.She was awesome!!!We even tolled her we were goin to yelp about her just because she went out of her way for us.She recommended the Chicken Marsala to my confused gf and I always get the Chicken Alfredo with mushrooms.The food came out quick and the only thing that bugged me was that there were only a few mushrooms in my plate. =[ Nicole comes to check on us and I say, its really good but I'd like to have had some more mushrooms.She says ooh okay let me see what I can do for you.She comes in 2 min with a bowl of them.I was SO happy haha.Little things like that and being a great server overall made up for the night.Thank you Nicole and to you Cheesecake Factory!=]"
Ramona H.,"Brentwood, CA",3,44,,3.0,10/22/2007,"I wrote a review of this place on 10-22 that wasn't  pretty. I then forwarded it to the Cheesecake Factory's website. I'm now changing my rating from one star to three stars. Why? Because I received a phone call from the general manager who was very responsive to my concerns. Now that's customer service, which is something that a significant number of companies have forgotten is still valuable as it relates to maintaining one's business and building customer loyalty. He was very cordial and sincerely apologetic for the service my partner and I received on our visit. And, to boot, he offered a $50 gift card for us to return. As a consequence, we will give them another try, which is the least we can do considering the effort and time they took. In a nutshell, it's very impressive in today's dining climate that a restaurant actually tries to make amends for less than satisfactory service. I commend the Cheesecake Factory for recognizing the importance of the customer."
