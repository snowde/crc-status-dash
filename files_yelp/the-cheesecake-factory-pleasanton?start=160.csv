Catherine P.,"Castro Valley, CA",7,29,9,1.0,6/16/2017,"I love their food however the service has really gone downhill. Today for example we order our food via phone. We are quoted 30 minutes. It takes over an hour. When the food is ready they inform me that they ran out of garlic and so we were given plain fries instead of garlic fries. Then we are informed that the beans and rice that go with our Baja chicken tacos are not gonna be ready any time soon, sorry. What a joke this place has turned into. They need some new management. It's so unfair to the wait staff to have the kitchen be so slow and so incompetent."
Mallory R.,"Salt Lake City, UT",93,80,1,1.0,7/10/2016,"I was in town on business and rushed for food options, so I ended up coming to Cheesecake Factory twice (it's right across the street from my office).  Both times I came, I was there for over an hour and a half. Not because I wanted to be there, but because service was painfully, painfully slow. I was there for dinner on a weekday and lunch on a Friday. The waitresses were both inattentive and forgetful.  The food was fine, but on Thursday I tried to order a turkey sandwich and they had run out of turkey. Both days I tried to upgrade my side salad to a Caesar and both days a green salad was brought out instead. All in all, I was thoroughly irritated.  Definitely would recommend you find elsewhere to go, especially if you're pressed for time. Or if you don't want to spend over an hour and a half sitting around waiting for your waitress to pay attention to you."
Leslie C.,"Dublin, CA",0,9,5,5.0,4/4/2017,great service and food I've been to many Cheesecake Factories and this one was just as good as the rest. Louisiana Chicken Pasta is sooo good. Amanda was a wonderful server.
Patrick L.,"San Ramon, CA",319,1013,875,3.0,8/16/2015,"My kid requested lunch for his 10th birthday at The Cheesecake Factory.  I tried to dissuade him thinking it would be a mistake, but I'm happy to report - it was great! Our waiter was really good.  She was friendly, fun and super-efficient! Food - quite nice.  I ordered off the light menu, as did my wife.  The kids ordered off the regular menu - Mexican, Italian and a sandwich.  Everything was tasty, perfectly prepared and nicely presented. We ordered a piece of cake to share. It delightfully delivered with ""Happy Birthday"" written on the plate, accompanied with the staff singing HB to my kid. In all, a really enjoyable lunching experience.  Come to think of it, I've never had a poor experience at TCF. 3.75 stars - thanks CF!"
Travonna C.,"San Jose, CA",34,19,106,5.0,12/30/2016,"40 minute wait but well worth it. The cheesecake was amazing as usual and the customer service was great, we had the best waiter."
Say H.,"Old Oakland, Oakland, CA",1,67,96,5.0,2/22/2017,Back for more of my favorite Cajun chicken little taste veery good ! This place always have people line up for sitting but is the price you pay for the food ! The plate is huge is good for two people and the price is decent!
Jennifer J.,"San Francisco, CA",106,432,5059,2.0,12/22/2015,"This was probably the worst dining experience I've had here and usually it's been so good in the past. Disappointed.  CONS: -We waited 45 minutes for our dinner and our entrees came out one at a time, long periods apart.  -AC is blasting so high inside restaurant -lighting is way too dim inside (mainly by booth area) that I could probably have eaten a bug and not even noticed. -my herb salmon rice was GROSS bc it was hard and tasted like old rice. Salmon was cold and overcooked and asparagus was shriveled and the size of toothpicks. Usually it's been good in the past, too.  PROS -waitress was very nice and checked on us. -cheesecake is always consistent I wish their service was as consistently good as their cheesecake is."
Dana L.,"Milpitas, CA",2,17,25,1.0,6/8/2017,"The one star was only because the food was good and our waitress was nice. I don't think she meant to give bad service but the service was absolutely awful. We couldn't get refills on our drinks. Asked for the dessert menu and she didn't return until after I went to the front desk to get dessert menus. At the end of it all, when we finally had gotten everything and we were ready to go, they misplaced the credit card. Oh, and pretty sure a few people were getting high outside as they were sneaking around the corner to hide out and then, we would smell pot. Our waitress wasn't one of them but I think the ones who were smoking were supposed to be helping her out. Never again will I go there."
Lauren C.,"Vacaville, CA",369,70,880,3.0,6/11/2017,"My family and I came here on a Friday before the lunch hour rush and before busy hours start. We were glad to come in and we don't see any ppl waiting around to be seated so I thought it was a good sign. We were only a party of 3 and we were seated right away and the best part we were seated at a booth. But, after being seated that's when waiting for seemed like forever started. The person that said that our server will be here right away didn't arrive right away. So we waited for about 10 mins before our server got to our table. And it wasn't busy yet so i don't get why it so long to even ask what we'd like to drink and give our complimentary bread. Even the drinks and bread took awhile to be given to us. We decided to not get appetizers and just get main entrees because who knows what how long that will take. So we just ordered what we wanted at the same time she asked for our drinks. As far as food, my dish was good. My husband had Kobe burger and he said it tastes like a regular burger probably wasnt cooked how he wanted. Overall, food was fine but the service in the beginning wasn't the best. Not sure if I'll come back to this location."
Erika C.,"San Jose, CA",0,41,20,2.0,2/18/2017,"The only reason I revisited this location was because my brother forgot the names of every other restaurant. We arrived after lunch hour was over. The restaurant wasn't very packed, and we waited about 20 minutes. This time the ladies at the front were much more friendly. So, a bonus star for that. After we were seated, we were given menus and we actually waited quite a while for our server to return. It took about ten minutes, and the restaurant wasn't even busy. Bread and water took five more minutes. Our order took more than half an hour to arrive. We were just watching people seated after us getting their food before us. I was debating leaving, but our waiter came back around after serving another table, and assured us that our food was almost ready. It didn't come out for another ten minutes.  I ordered the herb crusted salmon fillet from the lunch menu, since I'd seen it on the display while I was waiting. When it arrived, it didn't really look like the picture. I understand that items from the lunch menu are smaller than the dinner menu because they are cheaper, and it's meant for lunch, but only four pieces of asparagus? Come on, I paid over 15 bucks for that dish. It also looked like it'd been out for a while because the white sauce at the bottom had formed a film on top. The salmon was okay. It was cooked to my liking, but the herbs did nothing. It was like the salmon was steamed, and it was so bland.  The best part of the dish was honestly the mashed potatoes. I'm not a food critic, and I probably have less taste buds than the average human, and this dish did not impress. I've been coming to this location for many years now, and the quality has dropped significantly in the past few years. In my last post, the hostess was super snappy and rude, rolled her eyes at me, and pushed me down the wait list. We didn't even stick around to eat. I read the apology from the restaurant, but you should do better than that. I absolutely hate when I get my food later than someone who orders their dish twenty minutes after me. Fish does not take that long to cook. I've been to other locations where the servers even offered us a ten dollar discount for no particular reason. I read the most recent review where someone was offered free cheesecake and supplied with plenty of bread because her order took a bit longer. I didn't get any of that, and the restaurant wasn't even busy. There were so many empty tables around us.  I hope no one else has the same crappy experience as us. We still tipped, but looking back, I don't think I should have."
Nancy B.,"Mountain View, CA",85,7,,1.0,11/4/2017,Really bad service. They got me the wrong order and forgot a side on the other order we had for our table.
Tommy C.,"Ahuimanu, HI",99,375,1464,2.0,7/22/2015,"When I go to a Cheesecake Factory I expect consistency.   Tonight was a big let down.  The quality of the food has taken a turn for the worse. Dry overcooked salmon, and lettuce wrap chicken looked like it was just cobbled together as an afterthought. Plates were put together in a sloppy manner.  We had a party of 5 and were always short on plates and silverware. When we asked for the correct amount plates and forks we barely got a response from the employees.  Water was never filled. The waitress couldn't be concerned with anything.  Overall a disappointment compared to previous visits to this location."
Peter G.,"Modesto, CA",1,258,41,4.0,1/17/2017,This place is aways packed. Wait was not that bad. Told me 1.5 hours but just waited 40 min. Server very kind but need to pay a little more attention on what customers needs. Giving him the benefit of a doubt since he was working with an arm sling. His choice. Responsive when our chicken pasta tasted diluted. Even a kitchen staff came out to our table to apologize. Nice touch.  3 1/2 rounded up to 4.
Ian C.,"Berkeley, CA",24,55,59,4.0,1/1/2017,"This place is awesome and I prefer it over the SF location because this one has a great happy hour offering (4-6pm M-F). The wait is usually 30-45 mins if you don't have a reservation. Tip about the happy hour - you need to ask to be seated in the ""bar area"" in order to get happy hour. The nicer area with booths and big tables can't get happy hour pricing. The drinks are $5.99 for happy hour and the appetizers are also around $5-6 which is awesome. We all got 2-3 drinks and several appetizers and our bill was only $60-70! The food was pretty good but the factory nachos were a little to burnt. The avocado rolls were amazing and the tamale cakes (I think seasonal) were also amazing tasting! In all the service was great. Had a very nice and responsive waiter, but made a mistake on our bill and charged us normal prices for our appetizers. She however fixed the problem relatively quickly. In general I consider this location my main CF location. It's awesome!"
Ray O.,"Tracy, CA",56,35,121,5.0,1/8/2017,"Great food as usual. Service varies, but for the most part pretty good. Love the Miso Salmon, carbonara pasta, ahi carpaccio, Caesars salad, Fried Chicken Sliders and of course the thai lettuce wraps: which are always screaming!"
Hirra M.,"Oakland, CA",43,32,2,1.0,4/21/2017,"Never go to this Cheesecake Factory. The server CHEATED and added a 50% tip on my card while I didn't leave her any tip. She was rude and gave the worst service possible.  I went for lunch with my 15 month old on April 10, 2017. The server's name was Ashley (a tall white girl).  I asked for a baby seat and get it after 20 mins. I see her walking by my table, giggling, talking to bus boys but still didn't give it until I had to ask her the 4th time.  Service sucked, food comes in late, I waited to 15 mins to get my check while she flirted with a guy across my booth. Long story short, I didn't leave her any tip on my $19.12 bill.  Next day, my credit card company emails me a receipt of $29.12. Yes! She had the guts to steal from my credit card. Forgery!  I called the restaurant right away and told the general manager Matt to look at the receipt. He was really apologetic, said he would refund my bill but it's been 10 days he hasn't! This waitress should be fired so that she learns a lesson. It's pathetic how established restaurants like these hire cons! I was a regular at Cheesecake Factory but never anymore!"
Kerry R.,"Deerfield, IL",5,16,24,1.0,4/23/2017,"I visited this location on April 11 and although they were out of both NY Strip and Ribeye steaks I ended up having one of the best Fillet Migon steaks I have had.  The service was great and the food was awesome. On April 15th my wife flew into town to spend the holiday weekend with me (I'm in town for three weeks on business) and I was very excited to take her to the Cheese Cake factory for our Easter dinner.  After being seated I ordered a drink and was brought the wrong one.  We ordered our food and was asked if we would like bread and about twenty minutes later we finally received it.  When we went to eat the bread we noticed we didn't have any other utensils other than forks and waited several more minutes before we received butter knives at which point we shared one with the table next to us who was in the same situation.  I ordered the bone in Ribeye steak rare and when it arrived I received a medium well steak with burnt green beans on a plate that felt like it had been in an oven.  The steak I received was a scrawny boneless cut that looks like they bought it from the grocery store which makes sense since they were out of that cut of meat on my last visit.   Several minutes later my wife received her food and immediately noted the rather row rice they served her.  At this point I mentioned to steak and green beans to the waiter and he sent the manager over to speak with me.  The manager proceeded to pass the plate's extreme heat off as an effect of being under a heat lamp and tried to pass off my medium well steak I ordered rare as copacetic.  Eventually the manager offered to cook me another rare steak and when I received it it was refrigerate cold and looked as if it had spent about 10 seconds on the grill.  The steak was seriously cooked less than tartar, it was basically freaking raw and once again there was the burnt green beans.   Needless to say this was one of the worst restaurant experiences I have ever encountered.  Even though I had a terrible Easter dinner I was willing to still visit a Cheesecake Factory again but after I wrote their customer service department online I never even received so much as a canned email response from them.  This company apparently does not care if you enjoyed your meal and could care even less about the lack of professionalism the manager displayed. The floor in the restaurant was also so greasy you could slide from one end to the other with a little effort. I not only won't be visiting this Cheesecake Factory I won't be visiting any Cheesecake factory, PF Chang's or any other restaurant this company operates.  The lack of customer care and professionalism is bewildering."
Jennifer L.,"San Jose, CA",113,108,269,1.0,4/23/2016,"Came here for lunch on a Saturday. Place is pretty packed, wait time was about 30-40 min. So we grab a drink at the bar. Ordered an ultimate margarita and there was way too much ice in my drink, after a couple sips, the drink was done. Pet peeve, when your drink is made poorly!  Finally got seated and ordered our dishes. Food came out and my Louisiana chicken pasta lunch portion had a tiny piece of chicken. Def way less than what is typically given at the valley fair Cheesecake Factory. My husband ordered a medium rare steak and it came out medium well. He told the waiter and they offered to give us a new steak. Waited another 20 mins, and it came out again as RAre.... Had to return the steak again. By this time, everyone else at the table was finished eating and waited another 15 min for the steak to come out. Third time around it was cooked better, but he started to get full just eating so much mashed potatoes. Also, my drink the second time around was not even filled to the top of glass. Really?! Waiters are nice, but seriously horrible accuracy of food. How can someone get an order wrong twice!!!! To me, that means the cooks are not attentive. Only reason I'm giving two stars is because of service.  Probably will never come back to this location. I prefer valley fair Cheesecake Factory."
Amena S.,"Danville, CA",12,23,12,1.0,9/30/2017,"We went to Cheesecak last week on 9/26. We were there with family friends, including kids, and my husband and the other husband both ordered the hibachi steak. Our food came out much earlier than theirs, and we were already done eating by the time their steak came out. The explanation given for the delay was that they were waiting for the mashed potatoes. Which doesn't make sense, they could always just bring that on the side. Once the steaks came out, the husbands noticed that it didn't have any glaze or any sauce on the steak and the meat was extremely dry and tough. They called the waitress over and she called the manager. When he came over, he took the plates away and said they would make new ones. After waiting another 20 minutes, by this time, were were all anxious to leave, the manager came back and said they never had the hibachi steak, what they had provided to us was a different type of steak that they tried to make look like hibachi, these are his words not ours. He didn't apologize, he basically said they didn't have any hibachi steak. This was after they had waited twice for this steak. He offered us a paltry cheesecake, which we declined. At this point, we were done eating, the kids were anxious to leave, and our husbands were hungry and had to leave hungry. Not only that, he never came back, he never apologized for misrepresenting or ruining our meal and our experience.. On top of that, he did not even comp the 30 dollar meals that we ended up paying for. This was extremely unprofessional and left us very disgusted.  There was no one there to speak to since he was the manager.  I would never have expected an experience like this, after working in customer service for over 15 years, this would never have happened in my industry. We expected much better from Cheesecake Factory."
Chloe S.,"Dublin, CA",0,2,2,1.0,10/21/2017,"If I could give a zero I would. This place has such rude hosts it's ridiculous. Like hunny cut it with the attitude, no need to slam menus down and roll your eyes!!"
