Craig T.,"Pleasanton, CA",0,26,,1.0,8/12/2017,"I went here on a Saturday night to pickup 3 slides of cheesesteak to go.  After 10 minutes, I asked and was told they were working on the order.  After 20 minutes, they said they were working on the order.  After 30 minutes, I was fed up.   They told me the lost the order.  So after 35 minutes I finally received 3 slices of cheesesteak.  I complained to the manger and he was kind enough to give me a full refund.  But this type of service is unacceptable."
Maurice D.,"Brentwood, CA",173,50,61,3.0,4/15/2017,People eat here for the name and the cheesecake. The service today was slooooow and the food (which is pricey) was so hot and cold. What I mean is our sons food came out way before ours and when ours came out one was warmer and the other was on the cool side.  When you order food you really want it served hot.
Danielle L.,"Dublin, CA",0,3,,1.0,7/24/2017,"I have been waiting over 52 minutes for a to-go order after being on hold for 10 minutes and 42 seconds. Completely unacceptable for a restaurant to treat their customers like this. The foods not even that good!!! I only came because I got a gift card for my birthday. Definitely will not be back anytime soon as the manager really needs to step up their game at this location. After 1 hour of waiting for my food I finally receive it and my smoothie is completely melted. And apparently my food was ready after 50 minutes of waiting, but the guy behind the counter didn't bother to a call out my name or let me know! I gather up my food and he walks away while I'm still standing there waiting to pay he comes back and ask ""did you need something"" and I'm like ""yeah to pay for my order"". I could have walked out with $75 worth of food because the kid is not even paying attention to what he's doing. Cheesecake Factory really needs to fire all their servers and take that money and invest in robots to bring you your food!!!! You would get much better service"
Olivia M.,"San Ramon, CA",97,132,280,4.0,4/2/2016,"I came here for a Monday date night with my boyfriend. We enjoy going out on week nights every once in a while to avoid the typical weekend crowds. We were seated right away, but felt squished in a smaller table right next to another group when there were more spacious tables nearby. Our waiter was super friendly! We ordered drinks and appetizers that arrived quickly while our entrees were being made. The kitchen must have suddenly gotten backed up though because our waiter came out apologizing for the wait and offered us complimentary salads in the meantime. Our entrees ended up coming out minutes later so we never received the salads, but I was satisfied with my chicken dish. We got a piece of Reese's cheesecake to go and then headed back home. I'm sure we will be back again for another date night in the future!"
Ruben A.,"Pleasanton, CA",143,2,,1.0,8/21/2017,"I normally like this restaurant-in fact I would say I love this restaurant but the service tonight sucked so bad that we ended up at PF Chang's. We were told the wait would be 30min for a party of 6-and 55min later we watched as countless other parties were seated before, that came in AFTER us. When we asked how much longer it was going to be, we were told they were just going ""push two tables together"" and we'd be seated. Now I've never timed how long it takes to push two tables together and set those tables, but Cheesecake Factory standard time it means longer than 10min. because 10min later we STILL weren't seat and my friend was complaining to the manager. Do you think that got us seated?? It DID-right next door at PF Chang's. Sorry Cheesecake Factory-you can suck it cuz you lost our business tonight. #suckit #cheesecakefactory"
Kimberly T.,"Pleasanton, CA",65,129,555,2.0,3/23/2016,"Upon arrival, we met a HWA (hostess with attitude) wouldn't look up, very snippy, and moved head around a lot while talking. She definitely shouldn't be the first person greeting customers. After being seated, we had very slow , yet friendly, service. Tortilla soup was waaaaaay too salty and lukewarm. It's puréed, and looks like day old baby food. The lettuce wraps had lettuce that smelled like mildew. The dipping sauces were delicious though. My strawberry martini was also very good. Our kid's meals were very skimpy, so they left hungry. I had tiramisu cheesecake for dessert, it wasn't good at all."
Susan W.,"San Ramon, CA",1,73,2,5.0,6/11/2017,This review is for Tamieka.  Thank you for your excellent customer service.  Very friendly and outgoing.  Efficient when fulfilling my order.  Thanks again Tamieka much appreciated.
Jeremiah T.,"Pleasanton, CA",0,5,2,1.0,9/19/2016,"Came in at 5 to make a reservations for 6pm since we had about 12 people come. Didn't get seated till 7:30. I understand it was busy and they gave us complimentary appetizer. Cool.  Anyways. Service was slow. They keep forgetting to give us out water. Took about an hour to get coffee because ""they were making a fresh batch"" I don't think it takes an hour to make a coffee. It got too dark since the bulb went out and we asked for a candle since other tables had candles to light up their table. And the manager came by and threw down the candle unnecessarily hard. (Claimed she was trying to get out of the way of the server when there wasn't even a server around since they were no where to be found!!! )To the point where we all lost our appetite. Service was already bad to begin with.  Anyways the manager came back to apologize. But was too late. During stressful times she's not fit to be a manager when it comes to busy situations taking out frustrations on customers. It gives the company a bad name.  Server was nice any trying her best to be accommodating. Manager was not."
Jenny Lee B.,"Pleasanton, CA",1,21,11,2.0,6/2/2017,"I'm sorry but arrive at 3:15 pm told 30 minute wait, every other party seated - big party leaves - don't get seated until 4:00 pm -receive food at 5:00 pm. That is ridiculous and there are 6 empty tables around us indicating they are not busy. Receive bread after food arrives? Saw waitress/server twice, to give drinks and then when food arrives an hour after we ordered from a different server which we weren't told we were going to have different servers. I am a patient person and work Customer Service myself but seriously, no apologies no explanation. Even a heads up would have been appreciated. Keep people in the loop is all we ask."
Jason B.,"Stockton, CA",44,19,53,4.0,9/25/2016,My girlfriend and I sat at the bar. We had an amazing experience with Chris the bartender. Starting out with the Ahi Carpaccio as an appetizer which was really amazing. We then moved on to our main courses of the enchiladas and Louisiana chicken pasta. The experience with the dishes we're okay light on the sauce but suitable to eat. But I do have to say if you have the traditional mojito you will not be satisfied. True to the flavors of tradition of mojitos I was very happy. Also I might add try the Kahlua cocoa cheesecake which was amazing. I do want to say thank you Chris for a great experience at the Cheesecake Factory
Danielle B.,"San Mateo, CA",83,27,3,1.0,3/3/2017,"I'm sorry, but I was extremely disappointed with my experience here. It upsets me because I normally LOVE Cheesecake Factory; just not this location. I decided to take my sister here for her birthday and I told her we need to get there early because it gets busy (and I didn't want to wait in traffic). So we got there at 5. The wait was actually the smoothest part of the night. We waited about 2 minutes before we were seated. We were STARVING so I was looking forward to the bread. Well, 15+ minutes go by and no one has come over to help us. Like, at all. Eventually, our server comes over and greeted us with his suuuuuper friendly personality (which is absolutely great for others. But I was just not in the mood at this point). We were ready to order so I got us the Fire-Roasted Artichoke and Crispy Fried Cheese for apps, our entrees and drinks. I also let him know we were here celebrating my sisters birthday (CLUE). A little while after our server put our order in, he comes back with the drinks and says ""I'm really sorry but we're out of the artichokes."" I was kinda bummed because I was looking forward to that, but not to worry, we still got the best app coming (the ""cheese sticks""). These are LITERALLY my favorite appetizer in the world because they are very similar to the cheese sticks at Macaroni Grill.  I'd say another 10+ minutes go by, he comes back. ""So I was just told by a coworker that we're actually out of the Crispy Fried Cheese too.."" HOLD UP, WHAT?! That made me SO sad because my sister never had them before and we were both looking forward to that. My attitude totally changed at this point because, what the hell. How do you run out of that?? UGH. He tried asking us if we wanted anything else and seriously at this point, I wanted to leave. So we said no, its fine. CLEARLY upset and he should've noticed that. So the entrees come out and its whatever. Normal burger and a humongous fried chicken sandwich. I asked my sister if she wanted cheesecake (because I THOUGHT they might bring her a cheesecake for her birthday like they normally do). We order the cheesecakes and I also ask him to bring a jar of their ranch, which they sell up at the front near the cheesecakes. This guy goes ""well I need to get a manager with the key and blah blah blah."" I was like, ""Dude they are at the front. You can't just bring one up?"" I've never had this happen in the past. Eventually he comes back with an empty jar and goes ""so I'm gunna have to fill one of these up with the ranch from the back."" Do whatever you have to do because at this point, we've been here for TWO HOURS. TWO FREAKING HOURS for TWO PEOPLE. He comes back with jar with the weirdest handwritten label that just looked super sketch. My face looks upset and angry and this all should have been a clue. I wanted to talk to the manager but I also wanted to get the hell out of there. He gives us the check and I was hoping for some sort of discount or SOMETHING. Anything to try to make it up to us after this horrible experience. Butttt no. Nothing. I was PISSED. So I just paid and he comes to get the check and says ""hope you had a nice time here."" And I said ""no, we did not. We did not have a good time at all."" He stood there SHOCKED. ""Oh really? You didn't have a good time?"" I looked at him like WHAT?! How did you not know, dude. I said ""no, and it's disappointing that you couldn't help us out. But we're ready to leave. We've been here for way too long."" This just made me laugh and look at him crazy, he said ""Oh I'm so sorry. You should come back on the weekend."" ARE YOU SERIOUS? Why would I want to come back in general, let alone on a crazy busy weekend?! No thank you. Never come back again."
Victoria G.,"Wildomar, CA",55,19,3,1.0,12/30/2016,"I've been sitting here now for over an hour....for 1 person spending  $50 + on lunch (alcohol included) I AM NOT IMPRESSED.  lunch Salmon has very little portions compared to the walnut Creek location lunch specials.  Mashed potatoes are so dry...even after adding butter! Wait times are just stupid and when you want an appetizer before your meal....well, they don't understand that here! GO TO THE WALNUT CREEK LOCATION!!"
Shubhangi S.,"Van Nuys, Los Angeles, CA",26,1,,1.0,7/1/2017,Worst service! The wait time was 1 hour but we waited for 1 hour 30 minutes to get a table. They had other vacant tables but they kept giving it to others and finally when we did get a table the server kept serving others and taking orders. Nobody came to take our order or at least give water and when this arrogant waiter did come he literally threw the water glasses at us like sliding the glasses at us and making faces. This is unacceptable behaviour.
Cristina C.,"Fremont, CA",336,12,,1.0,12/27/2016,"My boyfriend and I decided to order take out at the Pleasanton Cheesecake because it had been a while since we had their delicious pastas.  However, that didn't go so accordingly. To begin with, the take out parking spots were all full with individuals that were not in the take out line or curbside as I went straight up to the counter when I arrived (no line). I ordered the Louisiana chicken pasta and he ordered the Evelyn's favorite. I asked for grilled chicken and received one small breast in place of the two breaded portions that typically come with the meal. Not to mention there was hardly any sauce on my pasta as if it had dried up. My boyfriends pasta had about half a tea spoon of pesto if that and was even drier than mine. Needless to say we had to muscle down our pasta with glasses of water nearby.  Even though we live right down the street from Cheesecake, we are pretty disappointed with an establishment we figured to be a well oiled machine."
Stefan T.,"San Leandro, CA",112,957,1707,5.0,4/21/2016,Went in for a bunch of to go slices and one plain whole cheesecake. The slices were beautifully packed and allowed us to try a few different varieties we wouldnt commit to fully by buying a whole cake. Everything we had was perfect. Wait time was acceptable given they were swamped. Well worth $50 or so.
Miranda C.,"Pleasanton, CA",0,2,,1.0,8/22/2017,"Horrible, service was really slow, took over 25 minutes for us to get our drinks ordered, took over 40 minutes to get our food ordered, there was food crusted onto the silverware. Silverware wasn't wrapped, just set onto the table which is gross. Will never go back to the Cheesecake Factory again."
Lisa C.,"Dublin, CA",12,104,36,3.0,11/11/2016,"Oh my this restaurant is all over the board!  Sometimes the food is great and sometimes not so much!  If we sit at the bar we get great service and if something is wrong we can get it corrected quickly.   Today for lunch was meh...not so great.  Cuban sandwich- barely warm for $15 (really- WTH!) Lunch order of Chinese chicken salad - just okay for $12.  Sodas are $3.50 - you are lucky if you get a refill!  Apparently many of the servers believe that taking your order is giving you service!  When I get the menus myself..uh, I don't think so!  Never checking how our food was- yep, par for the course!  Add a cup of soup and the bill was $42.xx.  Our waitress was lucky she got a tip at all!   I have addressed management before on their various issues, both in person and with surveys, but nothing really changes !"
Kenia C.,"Lathrop, CA",175,17,10,4.0,5/2/2017,"Came here for dinner not to long ago and the food was pretty good as usual but the service this time was lack luster. Also, I don't like that they insist on boxing your left overs for you! When were leaving one of the employees asked my boyfriend to help jumpstart his car which he had no problem doing. The employee I believe was from the kitchen staff & was friendlier than the servers, go figure!"
Deepti U.,"Fremont, CA",0,6,,1.0,9/30/2017,To-go order of 2 cheesecake slices takes at least 30 mins on average. Hate the service. No prior warning is given either for the wait time. Callous service on Saturday night. Would not recommend.
Jongchan Y.,"Davis, CA",86,10,,5.0,9/21/2016,"I visited here last weekend to buy an original cheese cake to go. I already knew that this place is horribly crowded with people especially on weekend, and that I might need to be very patient. It did take a while until I get the cake. I totally understand this.  But the woman who took my order was keeping checking my order status to make it proceed as fast as possible. I was feeling really thankful to her for remembering me and doing that for me even though they had to handle a bunch of orders (When my cake was ready, I was out of her sight to pick up  phone for several minutes, so she had to call my name repeatedly. I feel so sorry about that). I did not have a chance to say thank you due to the crowdedness. Instead, I am leaving this praising review here. Of course, I loved the cake =)"
