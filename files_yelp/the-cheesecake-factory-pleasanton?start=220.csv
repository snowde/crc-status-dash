Josh B.,"Fremont, CA",28,3,,5.0,4/19/2017,Stop everything! The Cheesecake Factory's 30th Anniversary Chocolate Cake Cheesecake is one for the ages. It is so go you'll order it for dinner and dessert. It makes me cry it's so good. Do not sleep on this. Thank you for bringing this into my life.
Irma R.,"Castro Valley, CA",1,5,1,5.0,5/4/2017,"Came here for my birthday on a Tuesday evening and received fast, friendly service from multiple employees. The food was delicious and to top it off the waiters sang a hilarious version of "" Happy birthday "" to me! Thank you Cheesecake Factory for helping make my day."
Simone G.,"Fairfield, CA",0,2,,5.0,11/1/2016,"First time coming to this restaurant in this city.  A little disappointed that we had to wait so long for our food and that our server did not check on us often as we would have liked. But the manager JENNIFER, was absolutely amazing. She came over and apologized for the wait. She had both meals remade and came out again to make sure we were satisfied after.  I am big on customer service and she turned a not so good visit into an amazing one.  As long as she is here,  I would definitely come again. She did not have to give us anything free for us to appreciate her concern and diligence!  Thanks Jennifer"
Katie F.,"Tracy, CA",0,3,,1.0,5/22/2017,"Disappointing service. The waitress seemed annoyed after we wait 15 minutes for her to greet us at our table. Had to ask for the bread basket, they didn't hand us plates so had chase down someone to get some.  Waitress didn't show up again until she provided our check, great customer service there.  I expect this at Denny's, but The Cheese and Factory? Really? Highly disappointed."
George M.,"San Leandro, CA",3,213,56,1.0,4/14/2017,Very loud hard to get waited on the food was not to be expected took a long time to be waited on an odd or I'll be with you in just a minute we've been sufficient but no acknowledgement whatsoever
Tory J.,"Santa Clara, CA",44,37,1,4.0,7/5/2016,"Service was painfully slow over the weekend, but the food turned out great. We got there around 8 o'clock and had to wait maybe five minutes for a table for the three of us. Our waiter came to take out order almost instantly, but we were definitely not ready to order. Thing is he didn't come back for quite some time which was a bit annoying.  When he did return I ordered myself some chicken alfredo with bread sticks and NY cheesecake for dessert. The pasta is typical, you find anything too special about it, but it's delicious nonetheless. Cheesecake, spot on. Enough said. Despite the wait times we had a great time here on our weekend off, fun place to go every now and again for sure."
L P.,"Oakland, CA",0,9,6,2.0,8/6/2016,Bistro shrimp pasta was  drenched in oil.....had the lunch portion and didn't even get to eat half of it.  Needed a bit of spice sprinkled on top. Wait is longer  than the time we ate...took 2 people and 10 minutes for some ketchup for my granddaughter's corn dog...
Ronny Y.,"Fremont, CA",52,137,121,3.0,11/12/2015,"It has been ages since I went to a Cheesecake factory. Decided to stop by for dinner with my Co workers one day due to its proximity.  The environment is very chill and casual so it is a great place to grab a drink after work. Service is kind of slow, but the workers are very nice and apologetic to any mistakes. We ordered a large variety of food to share with our big party. Ranging from plates of appetizers to pastas. My favorite dish was the lemon roasted chicken and basil pasta. The disappointment was the jambalaya chicken pasta as it was very bland. Overall, solid spot to come hang out and chill with friends. Don't expect too much on the food!"
Kamal S.,"San Jose, CA",2,28,34,4.0,3/17/2017,"Great spot in Walnut Creek, food is exactly what you are used to at the Factory, but the added outdoor bar fire-pit waiting area is something that makes the wait go by fast! The staff is very friendly and attentive, the only draw back is togo orders may take a but longer. Did I mention the outdoor fire-pit bar waiting area!"
Victoria L.,"Brentwood, CA",86,19,3,1.0,7/20/2017,"If it was possible for me to give no stars I would.. I never thought it would be possible for anyone to ruin my birthday yesterday as it was going so well. I have held many birthdays at the Cheesecake Factory and as many times as I've been to this restaurant, yesterday was by far the worst experience. It started out with me calling and placing a reservation over the phone for 6 people at 7pm. Someone took my reservation over the phone however when me &I my guests arrived they said they don't take reservations.. so mine just got lost in the sand apparently. So we get seated,We first order our drinks & some apps, we tell the server our orders but of course we would like it staggered.. we also place a to go order for the end of the . 2 apps to be exact. One of the appetizers come out   And yet we are still waiting on the other appetizer and we don't have waters or small plates to share the food with. We stop one of the servers, she is flustered and says I need to go get a check before I help you...(wtf) she comes back and grabs us some plates finally! We get the manager and all he has is excuses.. while he is sitting at our table (by the way who invited you to sit down) the server brings out the second app and the to go food! Our food isn't even out yet and we just got the appetizer. So I walk up to the server because she's no where to be found and place an order for my boyfriend who was running late from work. I ask her to place all the food order at the Same time so it comes out together.. she stated if I place it now it will take about 20 minutes. I said place it in 10 min.. ask I'm walking back to the table guess what?! Our food is there.. my food tasted like a frozen meal from the freezer isle of Safeway (orange chicken) it was cold, my sister ordered lettuce wrapped burger with nothing on it and she got a fully loaded burger and my friends rice was undercooked and no flavor. We took one bite of the food and placed it at the end of the table. Our server walked by 4 times and did not stop to see what the issue was... at this point we asked for the manager & we are not happy.. my sister proceeds to show her frustration and states ""this is bullshit and now I'm pissed"" the manager tells her she needs to watch her mouth... oh so let's piss us off even more by Chastising us . We tell him we don't want the food remade and what do you know all of 15 min later here comes my boyfriends food. When she said it would take at least 30 min.. i ask him to put it under a heat lamp. He asks us what he can do and we tell him he needs to take care of the bill at this point. He proceeds to charge us $63 and then has the nerve not to being the Togo food because we said we wanted him to take care of the bill. At this point I'm pissed, he has ruined my birthday. I have not had any dinner and I went off on him. I asked for the regional managers number but do you think he ever came back to the table?! Nope. Horrible horrible horrible, this location is a disgrace to the brand Cheesecake Factory. We should have went to Walnut Creek ! Thanks for ruining my day!"
Darci G.,"Dublin, CA",42,27,,2.0,4/8/2017,"I keep hoping that my experiences will improve.    I dialed in about ten minutes ago to place an order and was put on endless hold...... dialed from a secondary phone and was finally able to place the order for takeout .  Never quite sure why this continues to happen.  Their in restaurant service is so much better than calling in... but sometimes eating ""in"" just doesn't fit with the schedule.  I wish they could improve handling the phone in orders.... there are a lot of other establishments that do such a better job at it.  Stinks because I really do like the Cheesecake Factory... but my patience is running out with them.  When will I learn??"
Brandon T.,"Danville, CA",28,79,,1.0,4/23/2017,"Wow. I have eaten at many CCF up and down California. I have even eaten at this one in Pleasanton on multiple occasions. Today was my last meal there. The table we were sat at had dirty settings and junk all over our plates and napkins. We quickly reseated ourselves near by. A manager came over to seat another party and noticed that we were where we were supposed to be sitting. I mentioned to him we moved cuz the previous table was dirty and he nasty place settings. He nodded his head in acknowledgment but barely slowed down as he passed by. Server was pleasant but rarely saw her throughout our meal. Soup was as expected. Pasta as expected. Side salad? Why was it the last of all 4 things to come out? Really? Kitchen is ""still working on it""?!?! It's Sunday at lunch time -- get your shit together CCF."
Karen D.,"Anchorage, AK",30,16,1,1.0,2/4/2017,"It was my first time to a Cheesecake Factory.  Service was unbelievably poor... sat at the table about 10-15 minutes before we were acknowledged and offered water.  Our food order too about 30 minutes.  We were told one item held up the table but then it came out 5-10 minutes ahead of other plates.  The other plates were served cold, having sat on the warmer for an extended period of time.  When I pushed back I was told the issue was a salad hold up."
Orna P.,"San Ramon, CA",0,5,,1.0,7/24/2016,"Yesterday was my birthday I took my kids for a cake in Cheesecake Factory in Stoneridge Mall Pleasanton.   We ordered carrot cake, 30 anniversary, Oreo, and velvet cheese cakes.  We said we were in a hurry (spent too much time waiting for a table) so the waitress was very kind and served us quickly and the cakes and drinks came reasonably fast.  My kids ate from the cheese cakes and only me had the carrot cake.  All was fine until 10 minutes after we left. My stomach started hurt so badly. I had food poisoned. I have never felt like that before.  My day was over. I had to spend the rest of the day laying down. Weak and sore.  I then remembered that my daughter visited the same place with friends couple months ago and got very sick from food poisoning too. She had stomach pains. She couldn't get up from bed with out aching. She ate santa fe salad.  Bottom line. I will never come back to this place again."
Benny H.,"San Jose, CA",2026,1460,8032,4.0,10/20/2014,"I haven't been to this Cheesecake Factory in a long time, but stopped by as I was really craving the shrimp sandwich. It's still good! It's probably one of the most unhealthiest meals out there, but it's so darn good! Service was good as it normally is. For whatever reason the server went out of her not to make eye contact which was kinda weird. C'est la vie.  Overall, I love this franchise, while I know others do not. Good bread as well. I've never been disappointed in this place. Just wish the wait wasn't so damn long."
Jessica R.,"San Luis Obispo, CA",1,4,1,1.0,7/25/2016,"My hubby and I took a mini road trip to San Jose and decided to go a bit further in towards Dublin. For dinner we decided to try The Cheesecake Factory since neither of us had tried it before. The food was amazing, but regardless of how good the food was, the customer service made it an ubearable experience.  First, we ordered our appetizers and drinks, and that was quick to get out to us, but we had to wait 25 minutes for our server to come back to order our entrees. Once we ordered we had already gone through our drinks and were waiting to ask for a refill....15 minutes later she came and only took my hubby's drink and didn't take mine. when she refilled his I had to wait longer to get my refill. All this we were willing to let go because once our food came out we realized it was well worth the wait. But.....once we finished eating we waited for our bill/to go boxes but we (without exaggeration) waited 35 minutes for our waitress to even walk by our table so we can tell her we were ready to leave. In between that time i went up to a (blonde) waitress who was near a registrar and asked her if she can please provide us some to go boxes since our (brunette) waitress hadn't came around. She gave me the nastiest looking smirk and said ""you can wait"" and walked away leaving me standing there. I walked back to my hubby embarrassed and waited until someone remembered about us. (Blonde waitress never came back) Finally, when our waitress decided to come back she just said ""Sorry for the wait i had other  things i was handling"".  If the food wasn't so great I swear I would never step foot in this place ever again."
Brittany L.,"Castro Valley, CA",45,23,,1.0,4/13/2017,"Although the food is good, I am having to write this review because on multiple occasions, I have placed to-go orders, and the service is incredibly poor. The to go service is very unorganized, and I have had to wait up to 30 minutes just to speak with someone and give them my card to pay. They even advertise that you can do curbside pickup by calling a phone number, however everytime I call it just rings and no one ever actually picks up. This is very frustrating because the whole purpose of to go ordering, is to not have to wait as long, and to be able to pick up the food quickly and leave. I am very disappointed."
Phil A.,"Oakland, CA",47,116,778,4.0,10/31/2015,"Every Time I go here, I try to try something different each time as the menu is pretty big.  And the portions are always big, so be hungry. This time I had the jambalaya pasta with chicken and shrimp.  Good and spicy, couldn't finish it all though.  Good service, and good prices considering how much food they give you.   Not ordering cheesecake really lowers the bill."
Drea P.,"San Leandro, CA",42,12,,5.0,3/22/2017,I know my last few experiences were not the greatest but I recently ordered from Cheesecake and was very satisfied that my order was correct keep up the good customer service !
Kevin C.,"Concord, CA",48,14,9,1.0,10/18/2015,"Sat at the bar waiting for a table, the bartender was rather abrupt and when I order a drink for my wife (stopped by powder room) the bartender said ""who is the second drink for??"" I've never been asked that before. Finally seated outside and wait staff just kept walking by our table and talking among themselves. Finally, after waiting for 20 minutes I asked a passing waitress ""pardon me, are you our server?"" and she says ""I don't know let me check"" Wrong answer Our entrees took at least 45 minutes to arrive and frankly, they weren't very good. Angel hair pasta with shrimp (99% diced tomatoes) and some kinda Thai shrimp dish that tasted like it was coated in jif peanut butter and maple syrup. Nasty!! I'm skipping this place next time for sure."
