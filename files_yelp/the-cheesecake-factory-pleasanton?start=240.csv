Tatania V.,"San Lorenzo, CA",0,20,33,2.0,3/5/2017,Management is horrible!!! They need retraining  in how to manage and on customer service!. Hopefully no one ever drops or spills anything on you because you will be luckly if management will atleast say sorry. Most restaurants will comp some of your check if any incident happens on behalf of their staff..not here!!  waiter was good and food was good. Will definitely not return here
Michelle Y.,"Brentwood, CA",1,55,588,1.0,8/22/2016,"We came here for dinner,  brought my In-laws, for an early Birthday Dinner. We tried to order the Fried Mozzarella but, they ran out, tried to order the Beer Batter Fries, but they ran out? It's only 5:00 pm? How do you run out of food already? Service was extremely slow, waiting for our appetizers. The Crab & Artichoke Dip isn't as good  as it used to be. It was extremely salty & very Fishy? (Maybe old crab Meat, not fresh? ) My toddler was getting tired waiting , so we ended up taking our desserts home. I ordered a Tiramusu for my Hubby, a Carrot Cake for me, (just to try something different), I usually get the Red Velvet,  and my In-laws wanted a Lemoncello Cream Torte, but, Eric B, our waiter messed up.  Went back home,  the in-laws called because,  they wanted their Lemoncello. If, we drove all the way back to Pleasanton, it would have been at least a 45 minute drive. By the way, I was placed on hold for 35 minutes,  just to wait to speak to the Manager!"
Gautam S.,"San Ramon, CA",6,1,,2.0,4/2/2017,"I usually like Cheesecake Factory, but this wasn't great visit. The food quality varied. The appetizers were excellent. We also ordered the veggie burger, to what was just awful. The brown rice in the burger weren't even cooked. After that mess we ordered a pasta. It was bland, but much better than burger. This review would of been lower, if it wasn't for the amazing service."
M S.,"Oakland, CA",0,5,2,1.0,5/2/2017,"Celiacs be aware!!!! So I walk in ask the host if they have a Gluten free menu and he says yes! I then ask (as all celiacs must do)If they had separate fryers for non gluten items like fries. He says yes! I say great we will take a table.  Our server arrives I ask him about the fryers he said he had to check with kitchen. When he comes back he said that yes they are safe and fried separately. Great so I order burger GF bun and fries. Simple enough right? So after about 20 mins he comes over to tell me that he is going on break and introduced our new server. She comes back 10 mins later and tells me that the fries are safe and being cooked separately. I never mentioned this to her but I was glad she knew what was up. ANOTHER 30 mins goes by. So now it's been an hour since ordering. At this point the manager comes over and says that they can't make the fries separately and that they never do. I let him know that 3 people told me otherwise and it is marked GF on their menu. He apologizes and offers me a side salad instead. I say ok cause we were starving and annoyed.  After all this the ""salad"" he brought out was literally a tiny bowl of nothing but lettuce. Not one tomato, shred of carrot....nothing.  Nothing was taken off our bill. About an hour and half for this nonsense.  FAIL. Corporate will be getting a letter and I have never done that."
Ted J.,"San Francisco, CA",11,15,,2.0,11/14/2016,"Look elsewhere if you're in a big group.   We had 20 people and made reservations a week in advance.  They even called us 11am to confirm we were coming at 11:30 and they asked that everyone be on time.   We arrived on time and were given a 'it'll be ready in 15 minutes'.  No reason why, just a '15 minutes'.   After about 10 minutes of waiting and seeing other parties from 2-6 people being seated, I inquired why the wait.  The greeter said she was waiting on the manager to figure out where to sit us.  huh? say what?  I asked to speak to the manager since this seems pretty odd.   She proceeded to do nothing and after 5 more minutes I said, please stop sitting others and go and get the manager.  She wandered around and found someone who said we are setting up your table now.   Finally at 11:55 we sat.  No apologies from management. We order as soon as we can, probably by 12:15.   Well you know what's next.  Food didn't come out until well after 1:00.  My guess was a good hour.  Ugh. Also they proceeded to bring 1 or 2 dishes at a time.  It took at least 10 minutes for everyone to get food.  Come on now, grab a few extra hands and bring it all out at the same time.  Servers were nice but no one ever said, sorry we're backed up, sorry we're understaffed, sorry for anything.  No discounts taken off the fairly large bill either.   I cannot recommend coming here; especially with all the other choices in Pleasanton and Dublin.. some just steps away..  They barely get 2 stars (some people's food looked pretty good)."
Joseph H.,"San Leandro, CA",0,12,,1.0,4/18/2017,Just brought my girl friend here for her birthday they told us it would be a 10 minute wait after waiting an hour i finally went to the front dest to ask what was going on and Jessica told me it would be another 45 minutes that my spot somehow had got taken thanks alot first and only time for us i would never recommend this place
Maddie N.,"Pleasanton, CA",131,5,,1.0,3/27/2017,Waited 1 hour and 10 min for my food after ordering. Very annoyed. Didn't have 2 of the cheesecakes I asked for. Didn't have my appetizer I wanted. Waitress held card with her for 20 min. Never again will I be coming back
Steve T.,"Pleasanton, CA",623,1370,379,4.0,5/6/2016,First time to this location and liked it.  My gumbo was delicious.  Friends burger was great too.  Service was perfect.  Can't believe all the choices they have.  This place resolves the issue of finding something you want to eat and making everybody happy.
Linde H.,"Alameda, CA",352,180,138,2.0,11/6/2015,"This was my favorite place in high school, i would always always get the pasta da vinci or the Louisiana pasta, if I wasn't too full off the warm bread I'd slather in butter. I would get the tropical iced tea and add like 2 packets of sugar too just to wash down the pasta.  Recently I went again and got the da vinci lunch special. The pasta was too al dente. It was practically undercooked, I definitely wanted more sauce too. It was like $14 for a togo lunch special, nice touch with adding the bread and butter.  Maybe itll be better if I dine in?"
Alicia A.,"San Leandro, CA",84,289,447,2.0,5/12/2016,"Have to say of all the times I've been here, it's been the worse. Best part of all, no wait! Got seated right away. Drinks came out pretty fast...then it was a waiting game. Appetizers took forever!!!  And when it did, the plates were hot,sadly food was not.  It was down right cold! For the chicken pot stickers as my little one loves it. It was cold, the corn tamales cold. Entrees next,  hubby got the Kobe burger and it was dried and bland. We also upgraded to sweet potato fries and got regular fries instead. The angel hair pasta, menu did not state it was spicy but it was quite spicy.  The fastest process of the whole meal was paying our meal.  Wait times usually long but now I know better no lines will mean food messed up and longer wait times might have a better food served."
Sabrina C.,"Hayward, CA",55,114,107,2.0,12/23/2015,"Extremely disappointed with today's dining experience.   We checked in, asked for an outside table to not wait as long. We got seated quick. Than another group was sat after us, next to us. The server went to them 1st, I guess he knew them, talked for a few minutes, got there drinks, fixed their wobbly table, and took their order and we still had not even got a hello. It had been about 10 minutes by now. My son and daughter in law (who is pregnant) were upset. So they wanted to leave. We got up, I went to the front and asked for a manager. I told her what happened, she asked if she could sit us somewhere else and with a different server. My son really didn't want to but I said ok.  Next table, still took 10 minutes to get 2 waters and a coke. It was not busy. We didn't get our food for a while. We were there for over an hour. Thank goodness the food was good.  Needless to say, I will not be back for a while."
Mrs.Kifle S.,"Pittsburg, CA",0,8,,3.0,4/9/2017,We waited about a hour for our table our server was really busy but very attentive after waiting so long for our table we also had to wait a very long time for our appetizers and food and when we finally got out  appetizers the food was coming out right along with them. The food was pretty bland the portions were nicely portioned .
Haithem I.,"Dublin, CA",3,67,2,2.0,12/15/2016,"I have to say the quality of this location has declined greatly here. Not only are the waits outrageous at this location but has become one of the worst locations in the Bay Area. I recently placed a to go order for my wife and I. They advertise curb side pick up but they never answer when you call or they put you on hold forever. Eventually you'll just have to go in to the bakery and get your food. Also last time i was there they forgot to put my slice of cheesecake I ordered and paid for in the bag. When I got home and realized it was missing, I called and was put on hold for 15 mins. I was than told that I would have to just come back and get it. I told the guy I was already home and finished eating, he said well just come in tomorrow and ask for the general manager and we'll give it to you than. Thanks but no thanks you can keep your slice of cheesecake and your overpriced bland mediocre food but you just lost a loyal customer. I know this is a corporation but this location needs new management, San Jose, San Francisco, Walnut Creek locations are way better and don't allow this to happen."
Amber S.,Bay Area,525,602,1019,5.0,8/5/2014,"I have been here a few times and never left disappointed.  I recent came here with Hubs for happy hour (M-F 4-6PM in the bar area) We tried the Mac n cheese balls, roadside sliders and buffalo chicken wonton type appetizers (each $5.00) and a slice of Kaluha coffee cheese cake of course. There is a nice mixed drink HH menu as well for $5.00 each.  All of the food were big portions. 4 sliders, 4 Mac n cheese balls and about 8 wontons. We couldn't finish it. We both liked the sliders that came with pickles and the Mac n cheese balls with red sauce. The wonton app was just okay. There wasn't much filling a 1/3 of each piece was empty fried wrapper. The cheese cake was delish. I don't think there is a bad one. My hardest decision was deciding on which type to order. Our server was friendly, food was expedited quickly and was delicious."
S S.,"Bay Point, CA",28,40,70,2.0,5/28/2016,"Two pairs of people who arrived after us get seated before us simply by complaining about the wait.  Prices are high ($3+ for a fountain drink?).  Waitress was not trained on their new app that is advertised 10 times around the restaurant.  Chicken Costoletto a little bland. Steak Diane was good. Use the app, especially if you're going to split the check.  You see your bill as they put it in.  It also has images of the food, so might be better than their real menu."
Gee L.,"South San Francisco, CA",50,1,,1.0,3/19/2017,"Poor team communication. our wait time is 1 hour and 15 minutes . We didn't  get to sit until 2 hours and 30 mins later.  Manager involvement  was no where to be found .. no apologies and as a matter or Fact .. once the host told us to sit down one of her colleagues said I can't get you the menus right away since u sat your self down... This is the worst experience at cheesecake factory.. The whole team's inconsistency and the managers incompetency definitely needs to be improved and corporate needs to step in and address these issues.. Diane, she was the one who questioned why we sat our selves and  was one of the rudest hostess i have ever encountered. We had kids with us which made it even more inconvenient. We went from lunch to dinner due to their incompetent staff."
Prateek G.,"Pleasanton, CA",4,28,6,2.0,2/5/2017,the cheese cake is good but the food is very bad we went on saturday night so we expected delays but the food after 1hr 30 mins wait was very bad We ordered the spicy chicken chipotle pasta and veggie melt pasta had no flavor. it was stuffed with boiled pasta and hardly any sauce or flavor veggie melt was also too bad the side salad's dressing was not even mixed properly  the cheese cake earned a star in my review
Victor V.,"Hayward, CA",0,1,,1.0,4/28/2017,"Thursday April 27th 2017 - We arrived at the cheesecake factory around 6:45pm yesterday and proceeded to reserve a table. After waiting 30 minutes we were called up and they proceeded to take us to the back corner just to find out that all the tables were full and they had made a mistake. They called it a false update. We walked all the way back to the receptionist just to find out that our waiting seats were already taken. We stood up for another 15-20 mins with a toddler in the middle of the restaurant before they could clean out another table. We finally got our table but the waiter took another 15 minutes before taking down our drink order. 15 minutes later we received our bread but no water. The water came another 15 minutes later after we all had dry mouths from the bread. It could have been 10 minutes but our waiter decided to have a 5 minute conversation with the next table for whatever reason. At that point we were offered a free appetizer for the mistake they had made earlier with our table. We accepted and ordered nachos. We then placed our order of food just to have the waiter come out 10 minutes later and tell us that they didn't have one of the items in stock. After waiting another 45mins to an hour we started get frustrated. It took 3 people to tell us that our food was coming out soon. Obviously there was something wrong with our order. After all the ""false updates""  we received I told our waiter that we were canceling the order. I walked back to our table and we began to leave. At no point did they tell us we had an outstanding bill and the waiter let us leave. We walked out the door and walked to the car. All of a sudden 2 manager level employees ran to our car and accused us of walking out on the bill. It was a short fat Caucasian lady and a tall Caucasian man They accused us of stealing alcoholic beverages when all we ordered was 4 waters and a coke. Obviously they did not know what was going on in their own work place. I mean what the hell is a Georgia peach anyways? They took pictures of our license plate and told us the cops were on the way. I am disgusted to highest degree that this even happened. They even said that we ran from them with a 5 month old baby in our arms. After i told them that all we ordered was a coke I gave the short manager lady 20 dollars and she put it in her pocket. After realizing the mistake they had made she offered my money back but i said no. Keep it. We asked them if they wanted us to stay for the police but they said no. She said the coke is only 3 dollars so here is your $20 back and my brother took it. It was so bad that my brother is seeking legal advice for the harassment we received. This was supposed to be the last dinner before my sister flies back to South Korea for 1 year to her army base. By the time we left all the other restaurants were already closed. We settled for Tapioca Express yesterday night. I am not a active Yelper but the unforgivable service and accusations we received yesterday has led me to this post. I will be an active yelper going forward in order to inform the world of  the horrendous service that these restaurants provide. As i am typing there are multiple 1 star reviews to right of me so i am glad i am not the only one that see's the truth. Regards, Victor"
Joss Q.,"Lathrop, CA",60,2,,1.0,12/19/2016,"Christmas dinner with colleagues fun right WRONG if you come here, First the hostess tell one of my colleagues it was going to be a 45min wait which understood so we waited and then person after person had been seated people that had gotten there after us and  I would understand if it was busy but not at all I wouldnt call it busy it was moderate and tables that could've been pushed together where left empty...after 30 I had enough I asked kindly how much longer it would be and the hostess said 30 more mins WHAT i didn't understand so what else to do but wait not even once did they come up and tell us how much longer or just a simple thank you for waiting it will be a few mins they would walk by and just stare. My boss then goes up after the 1hr mark and the hostess walks away for 5 mins not to do her job but to talk to her coworkers.....all of them are now looking over as my boss try's to find someone in a split second everyone disappears and the hostess returns and she continues to call other people after 10 more mins she finally seats us so we go to sit down and a waitress then makes a rude remark all of us hear ""I have them"" thank god we didn't get her we got a nice gentleman that did his job perfectly and the meal was excellent as we receive our dessert we had almost forgotten of our rocky start until we were about to leave....A waitress ( red hair) muttered "" FINALLY LEAVE"" and two of my colleagues heard what she had said so my boss calls the manager over and she tells him the situation and he just kinda brushes her of like if that behavior was okay. As someone working in the food industry that is so disrespectful and especially for a restaurant this high end and at the end of our dinner and speaking with the manager we are about to leave and the same waitress starts laughing with her coworker ...This place needs a lot of help starting with management and customer service and yes this is going to corporate so hopefully no one gets treated like this ever again."
Celia F.,"San Leandro, CA",19,16,6,2.0,2/26/2017,"The food is good during the week, but on the weekend the food is terrible. I usually get the shrimp scampi with the herb crusted salmon with the loaded mashed potatoes. During the week the plate is full of flavor a medium size piece of salmon, bacon on my loaded mashed potatoes, and more shrimp in the shrimp scampi. When I went this weekend the salmon was so small and over cooked, I only got 3 pieces of shrimp, the mashed potatoes had no type of flavor and they forgot to put bacon in it! My husbands fettuccini Alfredo was so dry and the pasta was so over cooked it was breaking, he had to order extra sauce since the pasta was so dry and by the time it got to the table he didn't want it anymore. I was so disappointed I don't want to come back."
