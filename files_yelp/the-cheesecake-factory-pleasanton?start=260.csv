Christina M.,"Hayward, CA",63,1,,1.0,4/3/2017,"Came here on Saturday evening, told me it was an hour wait.  Two hours and a half we were still waiting.  Finally we got seated, we ordered the calamari was told they were out, we tried to get the guacamole with the chips and inform us that they were out of guacamole.  We tried to get spaghetti, inform us they didn't have the noodles but we can get a different type of pasta.  Finally when our food came out, it was bland didn't have any flavor.  I have never experience a horrible service."
Liz M.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",17,90,8,2.0,7/26/2016,"I stopped in to the Cheesecake Factory on my way to the mall for a quick snack and a cocktail. I was greatly disappointed. I realize this is a chain restaurant, but this place is a dump. It is so dirty in here. Ive been in Chili's nicer than this restaurant. The table was sticky and the chairs were filthy as were the menus. My plate was chipped. It was the Cheesecake Factory from the hood. I drank my drink, ate my snack and hit the road. Not after hearing all the latest gossip from the high school girls they sat right next to me, in a nearly empty seating area. We were so snug I even got to comment on their prom ideas. It was a memorable experience."
Vania C.,"Castro Valley, CA",694,361,199,3.0,8/4/2015,"This place is my to-go date night ever since I was in high school. I still remember having my winter ball dinner here my sophomore year! It's always a hit or miss but usually more hits. The place itself is always very clean and I always feel fancy eating here, even though I'm in jeans or something; there are these lights around the place that remind me of the Eye of Sauron...haha When it's a Friday night or the weekends, expect it to be super duper busy. They're usually pretty good with organizing guests but always make sure they have your times right and your name on a list. Service does take a lot longer on busy nights, even just to get drinks but I can see that it's one server running a lot of tables. I wouldn't get wings or things that take longer to cook on busy nights because they would come out raw on the inside.  As for my favorite here, it was Shrimp with Angel Hair; giant shrimps with a lot of tomato. Recently, it's changed to Pasta da Vinci. Even though I really don't like mushrooms, this dish is an exception. Pasta is never undercooked but sometimes they're over just a bit, not a big deal to me. The best drink in my opinion is their strawberry lemonade, with some sugar around the rim of the glass. As for dessert, the Fresh Strawberry Cheesecake is the best, simple yet delicious! Final Thoughts: Prices are as expected here, portions pretty big in size... I love this place but sometimes there are just things that turn me off a bit. All in all, you'll always see me back here every so often."
Zachary S.,"Dublin, CA",0,2,,1.0,12/17/2016,"I'd like to say I'm a pretty understanding person considering I work at an incredibly high volume restaurant. So when the host told us it would be an hour and fifteen minute wait it didn't bother me I know how these things go. I looked at my watch and saw it was 7:00 p.m. on Saturday Dec.17th. We waited till 8:15 and decided to see how much longer, again we work in a Restaurant so we didn't expect it to be 100% accurate. She kindly told us that we had about 30-45 min, kind of shocking that we were still so far away but again we understood. We then came back up at 8:42 to see how much longer we had, thats when Cheesecake started to drop the ball. The host again told me that we still had another 30-45mins to go. I then decided that I'd like to speak to a Manger to express how much of a bummer it was that we had waited so long and how our time didn't seem to be paying off. I was never awknoledged by not only ome but two managers, one of whom kept doing what she was doing at the host stand without even looking up from her screen. At that point I was over it. Lost a Guest today who really enjoyed dining at Cheesecake Factory. p.s. this yelp was created for the sole purpose of acknowledging this poor and extremely frustrating experience with this restaurant"
Sean C.,"Fremont, CA",1014,1383,2184,4.0,7/18/2015,"I wouldn't call it the Holy Mecca of ""Cheesecake Factory's."" But it does have quasi-Egyptian architecture hybrid with European florid color patterns, and of course, classic Michelangelo high ceilings. This is where in the paragraph I'm supposed to tell you what I ate for dinner. Come on, does it matter what I ate? Isn't the real truth is that I, and you too probably, come here to eat through dinner just to get to the cheesecake? Last night I had the White Chocolate Caramel Macadamia Nut Cheesecake, and wow, each nut is a full-grown whopper. I devour that, and of course I'm at the dessert display with the intent of taking inventory of which one I'm going to have next time I stop in this ""Factory"" at the Stoneridge Mall. Will it be the Tiramisu Cheesecake or the Caramel Pecan Turtle Cheesecake? To be continued... #goingfat"
Fudge R.,"Pleasanton, CA",76,108,,3.0,5/19/2017,"For such a busy location, they are always running out of cheesecake. I've been to this location about five times and four times they were out of almost half the cheesecake flavors or once almost the entire cheesecake menu was sold out so we ate dinner and left without having dessert. It was a Friday evening at 9pm. Seriously!? Start carrying more cheesecakes."
James B.,"Modesto, CA",56,4,1,2.0,3/8/2017,Buzzer buzzed. Handed it in. Still waited 15 minutes to be seated. Saw people come and go who handed in buzzers after us with the same number in their parties. Can only assume we were forgotten about? Maybe our table was given away? I'm still guessing because no explanation was provided.
Heather M.,"Livermore, CA",5,4,,5.0,9/26/2016,"I'm kind of puzzled by the 1 and 2 star reviews this location is getting - my boyfriend and I went for lunch on Sunday around 1 pm and waited about 20 minutes for a table, exactly on point with what the nice hostess told us. The wait was reasonable, as this location is perpetually busy. We decided to use our wait time to check out the neat menu slides on the televisions above the cheesecake counter. It helped expedite our service too, figuring out what we were hungry for in advance.  We were seated promptly after and brought our drinks without delay. Our server was very friendly and kept up very gracefully with the flow of her tables.  Props to her!!We never felt neglected despite the crowd. I believe her name was Alyssa? Anyway she was a total boss. I feel like a jerk for not remembering her name but also I was like on a rapturous mashed potato journey in my mouth, so. Pleasantly distracted.   But yeah, on to the aforementioned rapture: food was great - stuffed mushroom appetizer was totally delicious. I had the herb crusted salmon and bf had the chicken di pana. Portions are very generous! We had to take the rest of our meals home and get our cheesecake slices to go.  Again, the flow of service was really spot on when we went, despite how crazy busy it was. I think generally the disgruntlements detailed by the reviews here might be mitigated by a little patience, knowledge and preparation for how one's brain operates during a calorie deficit (grumpy babies much?? And I'm not talking about the children...) and understanding that Cheesecake Factory basically operates at rush hours at all hours. The food is great and definitely worth the (very reasonable) wait in my opinion, and also, there's a full bar. Who doesn't love a full bar? Have a cocktail. Calm down. Enjoy life. Be nice to the waitstaff because they are busting tail to get everything done for you. Your food will taste better without all that entitled impatient vitriol in your mouth, trust me on this! Anyway, fantastic food, exceptional service amidst peak flow of customers, and tasty tasty cheesecake. Also, the bathrooms are spotless. We'll be back for sure."
Jeff M.,"San Jose, CA",46,75,3,1.0,1/23/2017,Service is far too slow. Far far too slow. Over an hour for lunch. Food was good. But this is too long for lunch service.
ireene s.,"Santa Clara, CA",0,35,2,1.0,3/5/2017,"Poor customer service  Wait was horrible, this the worst Cheesecake Factory I being too No apologies nothing for awful service  Will never waste my money here again"
Cal P.,"San Francisco, CA",1,38,2,1.0,9/4/2016,"Horrible service and poor management. You are better off going a few miles north to Walnut Creek.  In the Walnut Creek Cheesecake Factory, it's a world  of a difference in how they treat customers and it is quite evident as that restaurant is bustling and alive while this one seems rather empty and depressing from the get go. I called this place just to make sure we  would be allowed to bring our small, quiet Poodle on the patio with us on 9/4 around 4pm. The staff who answered the phone did not know so she put me on hold.  I was on hold for 45 MINUTES before i finally hung up and realized they forgot about me so I called again. She answered again and I told her she left me on hold for so long, but she was completely unapologetic. She then said no dogs unless it is a service dogs. Which is odd because a few months back the staff allowed our pooch on the patio, so clearly they are inconsistent.  I asked to speak to the manager to give feedback about being left on hold for 45 mins and she abruptly handed the phone to someone else. The manager then said no dogs allowed. When I gave her feedback that the staff put me on hold for 45 mins for a simple question and did not seem to care, she too was unapologetic. When I told her they allowed our pooch in the patio just a couple months ago, she did not care and responded in a rude manner just as bad as the first person.  When I asked for the manager's name so I can report to corporate because I was so disappointed in how I was being treated, she had the nerve TO HANG UP ON ME just like that. If the customer service is this bad just on the phone, it makes me wonder about how they handle the food, wait staff, food safety and other concerns. Clearly they don't care about the customer! PS - when I called Walnut creek Cheesecake Factory, completely different experience. The host answering the phone answered my question about bringing my pooch right away and said absolutely! We dined there and everything was perfect including our waiter. Hence, avoid the Pleasanton Cheesecake Factory like the plague and head over a short distance to Walnut Creek if you want a pleasant dining experience!"
G P.,"Pleasanton, CA",2,10,,4.0,2/22/2017,"I had written a less than favorable review for TCF and it was deserved.  Much too my surprise I was contacted by the management with an offer to make it right.  We went to the TCF last night to take advantage of the offer and I have to say the in restaurant experience was much better.  Wife had Hibachi steak she said it was very good, daughter had chicken and biscuits (yes they had biscuits) and she said it was great, I had the smokehouse bbq burger and it was good, although again it was over done, not as much as last time but still not med rare, I am beginning to think this is a California thing because this has been my experience with almost all restaurant burgers.  The cheesecakes, especially the outrageous were also outstanding.  Our server, Victoria, was also spot on.   Thanks to the management of TCF and yes we will be going back."
Steve T.,"San Ramon, CA",2,6,,1.0,4/16/2016,"The food is fine but the service is really bad but let me give you specifics so you can decide how you define this service 50 min wait to sit down 15 mins before anyone even stops by the table to offer bread or water Another 12mins to get bread and water Another 22 mins to order  48 mins to get food Just horrible service, so much more pleasant and efficient at the DMV"
Mei Z.,"Visitacion Valley, San Francisco, CA",0,17,10,1.0,2/19/2017,So disappointed at their service. Came here today to pick up my 10 inch fresh strawberry cheesecake. The cake I got looks so off from the one they have there. It's missing  a white layer beneath the whip cream. And when I tell them that they tried to put a few more strawberry on top to make it look taller ????? And I was told that it looked different because that one is for display only. Really ?  Too pricey for a cheese cake. And it took them 40 minutes to get me the cake.
Gretchen E.,"Dublin, CA",107,1,,2.0,3/10/2017,They seat you after an hour of waiting but take 15 minutes to take your order. 45 minutes seated and you still won't have your order and no bread. They will forget to get your straws. The food for guests seated after you will arrive sooner than your food. The bread will arrive cold. This place is usually not this bad with service but god you would think they will improve.
Eileen S.,"Stockton, CA",11,65,23,1.0,10/22/2016,"Sadly the quality of service here is to be expected I guess. All I came in for was 2 slices of cheesecake and it took 40min.  2 thumbs down.  Walked in and went straight to the counter. The only girl behind was busy at work but in the 10min I stood there didn't acknowledge me at all until I interrupted her asking if there was anyone else and she replied I needed to wait for the cashier. All the while there is anywhere from 2-3 servers standing, waiting on the side for orders from her.  Cashier finally shows up and she's very pleasant. She begins to help a woman standing near the register when I again interrupt and inform her that I was first in line. She takes my order but then it's another 15min before I get it. REALLY???? At about the 10min mark I ask the host if there was a mgr I could speak with cause the wait was ridiculous. He says of course. He goes then returns and says the mgr will be right with me. I finally get my order but no mgr still. I wait a few more minutes then ask the host if the mgr was on their way? He replies and points to a woman walking away ""oh that was her."" I ask if he told her I was waiting to speak with her he says yes. I ask does she just not care and he replies ""I don't know you have to ask her."" My reaction: WTF??? She's now talking to someone and he goes over to them and the man instead of the woman comes over and asks if he can help me. I recount my experience and how ridiculous it is that I had to wait half an hour for 2 slices of cheesecake and then another 10min to talk to a mgr about it. His reply ""well I just walked in the door.""  Yeah these (bleeps) wasted my time. I get to the car to discover they did my order wrong too.  If you love cheesecake, mediocre food, and slow crappy service....then THIS is the place for you.  * Cheescake Factory, I don't know why  you requested me to submit my info on your homepage to talk to me about my experience since its been a week that I did so and like the rest of your customer service, it's non-existent. No contact has been made so again you wasted my time."
Michelle Z.,"Hayward, CA",1,7,,5.0,12/6/2016,Started off bumpy! But our server went above and beyond. Even brought me a coffee Togo while I was shopping! I will be back!
Macklin A.,"San Ramon, CA",36,14,25,4.0,1/29/2016,"Their cheesecake is one of the best around. With many options to choose from. I usually get the Cajun jambalaya with shrimp and chicken and it has always been delicious. Obviously the wait can be very long.  Tip, if you can get it to go if you just want to enjoy the food."
Max R.,"San Ramon, CA",7,9,4,2.0,11/10/2016,"Food is expensive, and certainly not proportional to price. The wait time is over an hour on a Thursday night. Time period between ordering food and actually getting it is ridiculous (40 min!). I suggest you go somewhere else. The amount of time wasted here is crazy."
Christine C.,"Emeryville, CA",1,27,1,1.0,7/30/2017,Placed an order on door dash at 6:01pm. It is now 8:01pm and the order has still not arrived. Our poor door dasher kept updating us very 10 minutes letting us know that the food was not ready. I spoke to Tameka who was manning the phones at the restaurant. I did not appreciate her attitude. She blamed the delay on some kind of holiday and told us the food has been ready for awhile but that there was no one to bag it. I asked to speak with a manager. Ryan finally took my call and it was clear he was unsympathetic to my frustrations. He told me to take it up with door dash.
