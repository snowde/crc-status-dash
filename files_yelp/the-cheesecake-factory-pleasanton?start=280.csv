Lynn M.,"Las Vegas, NV",62,103,326,1.0,5/10/2016,We came here to celebrate a late Mother's Day dinner... Let me tell you it was pretty bad ...the waitress thought she could take our order without writing it down when she couldn't even remember what we had asked her to bring...it took years for our order and the salad came last..I ordered the Santa Fe salad and although it was a huge amount it did not taste good at all.. My mom ordered the meat loaf and she said something tasted bad about it and they did not charge us for it...my brother and his gf asked if the burgers can come with lettuce and tomatoes on the side and I guess they ran out of it and tried to hide it in the burger with cabbage that was nasty! My mom was way too generous with the tip... Never coming back to this place again ..
Leah Marie S.,"East Oakland, Oakland, CA",0,3,6,1.0,1/25/2017,Went to celebrate my birthday here yesterday and I wasn't too happy with this place at all. I know it was late in the evening already but customer satisfaction is still what you need. I ordered the grilled rib eye with the green beans and mashed potatoes with a side of Mac and cheese. I wished I took a picture of it but my green beans for one wasn't cooked to my liking and the ends of the green beans that I feel shouldn't be in the mix where all there. As for the Mac and cheese never again it was pretty much boiled noodles with cheese just in the center disgusting. And the biggest turn off was how do you eat a steak with a butter knife. In other words I didn't really enjoy my time with them nor did my family out of all of our meals my husband was the only one who enjoyed his meal.
Dan J.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",28,6,2,1.0,5/17/2016,"This used to be one of our favorite spots. But tonight turned into a nightmare experience. This can only happen at BJ's right? We roll in around 9:30pm, it's pretty slow. It's about 10 min before the server appeared. We order dinner and about 30 min later it arrives. My wife ordered a burger med rare. The expediter say, ""medium well?"" A no! She says Im sorry we had a cook walk out. I will redo it.  Well that explains the slamming doors in back when we walked in. 20 more minutes go by and I ask for a manager. A lady appeared, not very manager looking. She apologized and said I will comp that burger and will check back to make sure it's cooked right.  My wife cuts the new burger open. It's the same damn burger, but even more charred! At this point we are done. Appetite gone!  Did the so called manager come back? A No, she was hiding in the office. $30 and an hour wasted. This location is blowing up! Stay far away from this place!"
Nana B.,"ヘイワード, CA",36,10,2,3.0,2/10/2017,"Very American style restaurant. All dishes are very big which I can't finish it. I was very interested in this restaurant because of Big Bang theory TV show. I wanted have experience to go here, but I feel only once is enough for me. Probably, I'll not go here again lol"
Renni C.,"Dublin, CA",51,13,1,2.0,3/13/2017,"Took an act of God to place a take order as the Managers and waitstaff mingled by the kitchen doors. Honestly I don't  understand how the manager looking types can stand there see that the take out line is growing as they sit and laugh while groping each other.  I've never seen anything like it.  The poor lady in front of me has been waiting for 40 mins.   They only had one cashier/waitstaff working  both the take out counter, then running to the kitchen to bring the food/orders back to the front. She faced upset customers and she was grace under fire, all the while the management continued to socialize and didn't extend a helping hand.  She even had to ""bob and weave"" to get through the inner circle of the managers and then ran to the kitchen to collect the orders.  When she emerged with multiple orders in both arms, still  no help was offered to her by the guys who sport their ever so important looking ear phones.  The impression that was given to the take out customers was one of, I don't care enough to pitch in to ensure for a positive customer experience as well as good ol' boys network standing around while the woman works her ass off.  Such a disappointment."
Nathan J.,"New Braunfels, TX",51,18,11,1.0,7/7/2017,"If I could do zero stars I would. We travel for business. A lot. And as such eat at Cheesecake Factory all over the US. This is absolutely the worst Cheesecake Factory I have ever been to by a long shot. Went in yesterday for dinner with my wife and daughter. Ordered an appetizer and kids menu food right away as my daughter was hungry. Appetizer came out in a fairly timely fashion. We then ordered our food. After 45 minutes kids menu food still hadn't arrived. Manager came over and apologized and assured us that the food was coming. So, 15 minutes later the kids chicken breast and butter noodles arrived. A very complex dish to assemble Im sure. We are then reassured several times that our food is coming. After 90 minutes we are told there was a mix up and our food is coming any minute. They tell us they are comping the meal but who really cares. I could care less about free food. It's still another twenty minutes before our food arrives packaged to go because my daughter is bouncing off the walls. When we get back to the hotel with the food, truffle honey chicken for me and farfalle pasta with chicken for my wife both dishes are tasteless and not seasoned well. We threw them in the trash and ordered pizza. I recommend folks traveling to eat elsewhere in Pleasanton because this Cheesecake Factory is a zero."
Chen C.,"Hayward, CA",102,7,11,2.0,1/15/2017,"Starting with the wait, don't go here when you are super hungry. It takes like about an hour for them to sit you. Always always busy. Then the food, it's always hit or miss. In pretty much all cheesecake factory location. I always order pasta. One day the sauce is creamy and good then next time you go it will be watery and too plain. Servers are always friendly though, that's one thing i like. But other than that i think that for the price i am paying, i am not getting it's value."
Brianna G.,"Castro Valley, CA",0,4,4,1.0,8/2/2017,If I could give 0 stars I would. Tried to call to make a quick to go order and was on hold for 10 min. Called back the front desk told me they would transfer me and there was only one person in line. Took another 10 min. Called for a third time and told the front desk I was on hold for 20 min already and she informed me that there was a huge line. I told her there was only one person in line when I called and now since there is a huge line I was skipped over and if I could place my order quickly that would be helpful. Instead of giving great customer service (in which you were hired for to work the front desk ) she tells me since I called the front desk all she could do is transfer me and I could wait. I told her this was un acceptable and I would write a yelp review about their service and she said that was totally ok and all she could still do for me was transfer me. I used to be a regular here because I work close by and would come here for my lunch breaks but I will be taking my money to another establishment. All I wanted was a nice Caesar salad. Lol
Brandy B.,"Columbia, SC",172,132,802,1.0,9/23/2016,"Worst Cheesecake Factory experience ever...  Who goes to The Cheesecake Factory when visiting a new city?!!?!!  This was suggested by my friends -  I obliged. (#fail). I don't know if everything was heightened because I'd been awake since 3:30am EST and was starving or what because I was pretty delusional and numb by the time this ""dining"" experience was over. I've only been to The Cheesecake Factory in Charlotte NC numerous times so I thought I'd know what to expect - we waited 25mins for a table for 4 (which is exactly the wait time the hostess quoted us, so no biggie), our buzzer goes off we give it to the host, he has us stand and wait for another hostess to seat us... we wait 5 more minutes. We get sat at a nice round booth table (party of 4) so it's really spacious - and the seats are disgustingly dirty, like no one has ever climbed in to clean the back part of the booth. My son isn't one to complain but he was super thirsty - we waited 10 mins for the server to greet us before going to wash our hands and look for a water fountain or something (he never came) - we went to the bathroom came back, he still never came, we sat and sat and sat and THEN he showed his face to welcome us and state that he'd return shortly... 10 minutes later he appears, we're ready to order EVERYTHING.  So we waited ~30 mins for drinks!!!!!!!!! He comes back 10 mins later with our waters and two sodas, and another 2 mins later with my friends drink. Our app arrives maybe 5 mins after the last drink...loaded baked potato bites were delicious (only positive about the meal)... then we sit and sit and sit and sit - 20 mins after the app, my friends' dishes arrive, hers is wrong, the server doesn't come over to let me know our (my son and I) food will be out shortly for another 10 mins after their dishes had arrived, at that point she tells him it's not what she ordered, I ask for my son's food in a to-go box because he is now sleeping on my lap. My son and I wait another 15 mins before our server appears with our food (he forgot my sons fries and my extra ranch).  They order cheesecakes then (because we know that'll take another hour) and request the check.  He brings back the correct food for her within 5 mins (which was odd - due to the previous wait time and supposed ""back up"" in the kitchen). My crispy shrimp sandwich was disgusting - the shrimp was rubbery - the salad was nothing life saving either. At this point I'm too weak and tired to care or complain, I just wanna get some fuel and get the heck out! My friends fiancé was the only one who enjoyed his meal. The server never apologized for the extreme dysfunction, never took notice to the fact that i only took two bites of the sandwich and one fork full of the salad - never invited the manager over to make things right or at least show that they cared.   In Charlotte, wait times can be up to 3hrs (but once you're sat it's pretty much smooth sailing from there).  I thought a 25min wait time was amazing and this place was far less crowded than Charlotte - boy was a wrong. It was BAD - and I'm happy it's over!!!!!!!"
mengzi w.,"Pleasanton, CA",0,267,68,3.0,1/30/2017,"Not a cheesecake fan, but kids love it, though they probably don't have memory of it anymore, it has been a long while since last visit. Their cakes are pretty good, portions are huge mind you if you are not a cake fan. The food is mainly Italian, typically overpriced a bit compared to steak house or grills, we never get the idea why pastas cost almost as much as steak. The meal was enjoyable but there is nothing extra to complement either the pasta or the steak, just average. The decor and service is very good, and that's probably why it is overpriced."
Khoa T.,"Fullerton, CA",15,13,5,1.0,1/13/2017,"My family and I visited CF about a month ago and it was by far one of the worst experiences we've had in a long time. The food took extremely long to come out and it was cold. They also told my little brother that they were out of shrimp 30mins into waiting. He didn't receive his food until my parents and I finished our re-heated food. He ended up taking it home because he lost his appetite. The manager didn't seem to care. I work in a restaurant myself and I've never complained to a manager or wrote a bad Yelp review before, but my family and I will definitely not be coming back to this establishment."
Rosanna B.,"San Jose, CA",3,20,2,1.0,7/22/2017,"Labika is not that great of a hostess. We Checked in with her and she said 30 minute wait. After 40 minutes, she approached me and offered us a seat outside in the sun because there were no umbrellas available. It was 100 degrees out so we opted out for sitting outside, labika said it would be an additional 40 minute wait. When i explained that we had been waiting 40 minutes already. She corrected me by saying that I had only been there 13 minutes. My husband corrected her by telling her that we had been there 40 minutes. Then she said that she was not the original person that helped us and would need to go Check with the other hostess. When we told her she was the one that helped us she was flustered. there are 2 girls to choose from at the front and its not hard to mistake them, she said she had to talk to a manager...I overhear her telling him that we have only been there 13 minutes and i was being difficult. I stepped in and explained that we have now been there for 45 minutes, not 13...and that she doesn't have her facts straight. She then proceeded to tell me i was wrong again. While we were standing around waiting, the manager had even addressed us with a hi and Thank you for coming in after we had been waiting 25 minutes, so he knew we were waiting longer than she insisted on.   It seems that since she never asked my name, she assumed that it was Jared. My name is Rose..yes I am a girl! She then wanted to argue that I told her my name was Jared...dear girl, you never asked my name, if you did i would have told you rose, I can even show you Id in 4 different types. But thank you for assuming i am a boy. I do look like a girl with boobs, makeup and hair done! Yet, you continue to treat me like a was lying. The manager found my name Rose and stated that we checked in 47 minutes ago...When i looked at her for an apology,  the manager said that it was not necessary. Way to back up your lying employees. She was caught in numerous lies yet he backed her up and not even offered an apology to me. This is by far horrible customer service. If You made a mistake, as people do, own up to it. Don't continue to harass the customer to try to cover your tracks. I am so glad that this happened because I WILL NEVER RETURN TO YOUR RESTAURANT. This happened at approximately 6:40pm July 22nd.  This is by far the worst lying job from employees to customers I have seen in a long time. And what a horrible manager to have such a cocky attitude towards the customer when it was evident that your employee is a liar!! He was even able to tell me i waited 47 minutes not the 13 his employee continued to state. Bad bad bad manager and employee!! See ya cuz I will never be back!!! Buy really just want to say Thanks! Thanks for helping me make a review of your bad service!!"
Dan C.,"Pleasanton, CA",413,133,63,1.0,11/9/2015,SAD SAD SAD... Restaurant was empty on a Wednesday night for a party of 10... Manager went out to set things up for us... only to come back and say it was over an hour wait.  We looked out outside and there was literally 12 open tables.  Went back in and spoke to the manager and he claims there was only one server.  Dinner time and only one server?  Either way this is terrible! Place has taken a major turn for the worse!!!
Justin B.,"Livermore, CA",1556,258,124,5.0,3/6/2016,Come hungry. The menu is huge and the portions are even bigger. If you order a salad off the menu you might want to share because they are HUGE. Even the normal dinner dishes are huge portions. I can eat and majority of the time I break up the dish into two meals.  Tonight there was a long wait but we lucked out and found a high bar top table in the bar to sit and eat at. Those tables are first come first serve. If you are on a date stock those tables if there is a long wait.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU REQUEST CHRIS H AS YOUR SERVER. Here is why!!!  * Great personality and you can tell he loves doing what he is doing.  * Hustles around quickly to get things done.  * Always had the drinks refilled without even asking.  * Would recommend plates and items for everyone.  * Never rushed us to order or to get out!  **Cheesecake Factory take note to how Chris H works. He should train waiters/waitresses on how to work.** We had ordered:  Appetizer: Soy glazed edemamme Dinner: Eggplant Parmesan and Crusted Chicken Romno Dessert: Cheesecake to go of course
Clarence B.,"Danville, CA",52,209,136,3.0,6/10/2016,Really I think the only thing the Cheesecake Factory does well is cheesecake little overpriced you're paying for the ambience but food is about A step above Denny's in my opinion but it's always a great place to gather for family get-togethers with plenty of room and casual dress TVs and a full bar
Raquel Y.,"San Francisco, CA",960,621,1196,3.0,9/26/2014,"Cheesecake Factory is a nicer chain with delicious but high carb food.  Great service, always a long wait.  But it's the one restaurant where everyone always comes for their birthday to get a special free dessert. Some Notes: - Stuffed mushrooms were BOMB!! Fontina and Parmesan cheese, garlic, and herbs in a wine sauce (4.5 stars)  - Bistro shrimp pasta with crispy battered shrimp mmm. But the basil-garlic-lemon cream sauce was a bit heavy and buttery, still good tho (3.5 stars) - Pasta di Vinci with mushroom sauce was pretty good (3.5 stars, wish there was more sauce and shrimp. Will order some shrimp next time!) OVERALL: I'd come here maybe once a year, because their sauces and cheesecake are delicious but the wait and calorie intake makes me stray away."
Sophia W.,"San Francisco, CA",33,80,1149,3.0,3/13/2016,"Usually the service here is great, but today the service was extremely slow. Our waitress was not very friendly or attentive, and rarely checked up on us. The food is always good here, but unfortunately the service is inconsistent. We ended up waiting almost forty minutes for our lunch, which was a huge disappointment considering how good the service usually is."
Maryann C.,"Pleasanton, CA",2,38,,2.0,7/10/2017,"Don't eat here!!  Wish I read all the bad reviews before we did.  I'm sure I'll get a message apologizing from the team, where no specific person takes ownership and identifies themselves by full name!   Had a group birthday dinner here tonight.  Drinks from the bar, overall great, mojotos were good, husband didn't like dirty martini, says it was horrible.  Service in bar was good.   Dinner was a mess!  Waitress was good but the kitchen failed on several meals.  Thai lettuce wraps were great.  The ladies name favorite pasta was served with no sauce on the pasta.  It was bone dry, barely cooked vegetables,burnt broccoli, just tasted terrible because it was so dry.  It didn't even look good, something you could throw together at home for $2.  There was little to no honey truffle on the fried chicken dish.  The hanger steak dinner arrived with no wasabi potatoes at all.  The plate was 1/2 empty and waitress said the potatoes are coming in 5 min.  10-15 min later after the steak is mostly eaten, plain mashed potatoes arrived.  Person ordered this dish to specifically get wasabi potatoes.  No apology or offer to correct it.  Then also has to ask for the mushrooms the dish was supposed to come with, then gets a little dish of mushroom. His meal was delivered in parts, completely unacceptable.  Apparently the manager was working on getting his potatoes, but how can food be leaving the kitchen like this, especially after such a long wait to begin with and it's Monday night after 7:30 pm!  We bought drinks, dinner, and desserts for 6 people and will not return again.  It was that disappointing from the kitchen!  No one tried to accept responsibility for messing up the dinners.  I do not recommend you spend your money here, as this was super disappointing.  Cheesecake Factory management does not care about the food they serve to their customers, but they are happy to take your money!  This location might as well shutdown the reviews prove it."
M B.,"Fremont, CA",0,3,,1.0,2/12/2017,"30 tables ready outside (I counted), 20 people waiting for the entire restaurant, and they still had the temerity to demand a 50 minute wait. If they can't do the simple job of managing an average level of demand, why would I expect them to do even a passable job with the food? Don't go here. Do not validate the choices of their management to not actually fully seat the restaurant by giving them your money. Pick a local chain of eatery that respects their customers, not a restaurant that calls themselves a factory."
Tru T.,"San Leandro, CA",45,81,197,1.0,10/8/2016,"This will probably the worse review I've ever given to any establishment. Came here a few weeks ago with my family for dinner. It started off good with our waiter, he was funny and prompt. We asked a few questions about our appetizers and a soup our waiter made a few jokes about it and even told us if we didn't like the soup that evening he would take it off the bill.. after a long wait our order was taken, not once did he come check on us or even ask if we wanted anything else to drink after our glasses were emptied. About 25minutes after our order was taken, our appetizers and our soup never came out. Only our main dishes made it to our table and the quality that evening was really not that good, Under seasoned and lacking. When we asked about it with a server who dropped off our food, our waiter came to us to speak about the matter. He flat out lied to our faces and asked that ""we ordered appetizers?"". Well ummm yeah we had a full on conversation about it and you even joked a lil about another dish. We still tipped him but I have never tipped so little on the amount of the bill be had...we even left a comment on the receipt ""come on bro"".  I was so surprised! I have been to numerous Cheesecake Factory locations more then several times over the years including this location and this experience was underwhelming to say the least.  I wouldn't recommend to come to this location due to lack of training and moral. I've never experienced anything like that."
