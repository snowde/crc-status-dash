Jacob M.,"San Francisco, CA",78,4,,2.0,1/21/2017,"Long waits and slow staff, waited 1 hour after I was told 5 more minutes. Overall , it's a small facility."
kimba k.,"San Jose, CA",0,40,8,3.0,1/2/2017,"I can't believe this place does not use pagers. It is such a high volume restaurant with a sea of people constantly waiting for a table. I hear the hostess calling over and over, ""Burt party of four..."" in a meek voice and I just want to scream. Pagers people!"
Peter C.,"San Leandro, CA",167,2,,3.0,7/17/2017,"The waiters are nice and helpful, however, the food takes a LONG time to get to you..."
Deniece B.,"Stockton, CA",119,263,85,3.0,5/1/2016,"Love this spot but why is it always busy? Meh! Service was great, wait staff nice, but I didn't like how they rushed us to pay and leave. Ok I know they need seats but I wanted to chill. I just hate going to places where they ask if ""everything is ok"" every 5 mins. With that said, I appreciate that they checked on me.  *One issue I had was ordering cheesecake to go. The front desk is way too busy and not organized. People are ordering food, picking up food, ordering cheesecake and calling in. There needs to be a better system."
Melissa P.,"Hayward, CA",8,25,44,2.0,3/5/2016,"Went on a Monday and there was only about a fifteen minute wait, so we didn't wait too long. We were seated and given menus, but we had to wait around another ten minutes to meet our waiter. She took our drinks and we got them pretty quickly, but we didn't get our bread basket yet; we then asked our waiter and she said she'll be back with it. She came back and we were introduced to a new waiter but still no bread, and we then asked her. We probably waited twenty minutes to get our bread and we didn't have our entrees yet either. She said it would be out soon but we waited almost forty minutes for our food. And when she came out she only came out with three out of the four dishes. She also informed us that the fourth dish will be coming out soon too but we waited another twenty minutes for the fourth dish. So A LOT of waiting was done that night.  I ordered the Southern BBQ chicken salad. It was humongous, had lettuce romaines, black beans, tomatoes, grilled chicken, corn, avocado and thinly fried onion rings on top. It looked very appealing and really good to eat. But, when you bit into the chicken it was really cold, and if you bit into the fried onion ring it was really cold and almost soggy. I also tried their chicken tacos, the last plate to come out, and the rice was all hard and the tortilla was falling apart. The chicken also tasted over seasoned.  I don't know what it was about that night but usually my experience at the Cheesecake Factory is always a good one but this one was just upsetting. Although, I'm sure they saw our frustrations they were nice enough to take the last dish that came out off our bill."
Stefanie D.,"Rio Vista, CA",0,6,,1.0,9/18/2016,"Terrible! Horrible service!  I don't mind the 50 minute wait for a table, because the food and cheesecake are usually good.  The waiter took our order quickly, then never came back.  After 45 minutes, he came back and said ""they haven't brought you your food?""  Which was 3 appetizers and a salad.  Then he said they didn't have one of them anymore.  So we ended up with two of the four things we ordered.  Then he never came back.  We had to ask another sever for the bill.  When she went to hunt it down, he came and said ""oh they haven't brought it to you?""  He came back left the bill without a single apology and no mention of would we be interested in any cheesecake.   Really at The Cheesecake Factory?? I'm thinking we will not be coming back to this location again, we will go to Walnut Creek."
Erika G.,"Hayward, CA",83,10,1,5.0,12/27/2016,"Went here for the first time the weekend before Christmas. It was super busy due to people shopping nearby for Christmas. Although it was busy I did not think the wait was excessive. I like that the menu has a lot of vegetarian friendly options. Our waiter was named Robert or Bob/Bobby? He was friendly, funny, and made our overall experience great."
D Y.,"San Jose, CA",46,1039,190,3.0,12/1/2016,thai glazed salmon - pretty good iced tea - standard service - good
Mark T.,"Berkeley, CA",0,45,6,1.0,8/16/2016,"I ordered a salad.  The salad was bland and had very little chicken.  Given the enormous complexity of assembling a salad with slivers of cold chicken I was not at all surprised that I didn't receive my salad until 40 minutes after ordering it. If this place was in walking distance to my house and the salad was ~$3.00 instead of $14 I would recommend it.  As it stands, you'd be better off going to bed hungry."
Edward B.,"San Ramon, CA",982,127,673,5.0,3/26/2015,"Five Stars? Really? Yes, here's why: Upon my last visit, we were seated close to another table, an empty table. But who knows who could be showing up and barking all loud while i'm trying to enjoy a rare quiet moment at this fine establishment. We requested a window booth since the sun was setting on an overcast day and it was just nice, soft light, and I knew we could enjoy some great conversation without having to scream to hear each other. We started with the Buffalo Blasts, which are really the epitome of fried indulgence. The accompanying celery sticks help wash the palette. We were always offered refills of iced tea even when still 2/3 full. I had the Orange chicken which was wonderful. I could tell real orange zest had been used in the glaze and the tenderness of the chicken was totally on point. Whoever prepares this meat knows EXACTLY the temperature to cook at because it was perfect. Pick a slice of cheesecake to take home, or enjoy the ambiance and complex interior detail and soft lighting with your rich, sweet treat. Even better to celebrate the end of the week before the diner rush! Five stars because we always get taken care of in a great setting."
Tammy P.,"San Leandro, CA",294,243,1901,2.0,8/24/2015,"Bread and butter are good but everything else is a disappointment and not worth the money. It was my first time at a Cheesecake Factory and I had high expectations because so many people have raved about this place. The menu has way too many items, which means the food is mediocre or just not good at all. The shepard's pie looked like a pile of mush. The meat layer looked like soggy dog food and the mashed potatoes didn't even look toasted. The flavors tasted really Asian for some reason. The sandwich was your typical sandwich, too much filling for such thin slices of bread. The bread on the bottom was soggy from the heat and juices of the food. Nothing held together and I had to eat it with a fork. I would probably only come back for the cheesecakes."
Jennifer H.,"Dublin, CA",445,248,310,2.0,4/24/2015,"It's a chain... It was 7pm Thursday night, my 12 year old and I walked into a packed Cheesecake Factory for dinner.  It was a 20 min wait.  Not bad, but nowhere to sit.  With pager in hand we waited for little table in a full space.   The decor is big and overwhelming.  The restaurant isn't too loud to have a little conversation.  TVs at the bar.  My son who has never been to Vegas said, ""this place it's  nice, it's like we're in Las Vegas."" The food is fine, it is a chain.  I think it's pricey for what it is."
Christine T.,"Danville, CA",4470,648,905,3.0,3/13/2014,"The kids LOVE this place.  It's really not my cup of tea, but I'm always ""down with it"" provided that (1) I'm already at the mall and (2) there is little to no wait.  To walk in during a lunch or dinner rush is setting everyone up for disaster and should be avoided at all costs.  But if you can time it correctly and be seated relatively quickly, then by all means....   The food is the food--nothing great, but good and you can find comfort in knowing that what you order will be the same as the last time.  Warm bread (careful not to eat the whole loaf!) and tons of choices make it a good ""go-to"" when (again) you are already at the mall.  The fact that I can order something guilt-free off the ""skinnylicious"" menu is a plus.  The price is fine, the service is fine, the happy hour was fine--everything is a-ok."
Anthony L.,"Pleasanton, CA",44,25,48,1.0,9/18/2016,Came here at 5pm to arrange dinner for my mom total of 12 people we didn't sit till 7:10 manager on floor said she will comp appetizers for us turns out they ran out of a few items on the menu. Service was slow I'm still waiting for my coffee refill they said a new batch is roasting it's been almost 15 mins already still waiting for our food this has got to be my worse experience here
Dominic John F.,"San Jose, CA",2,5,,1.0,3/3/2016,Slow and inattentive service. A smile goes a long way but not THAT long. Our server would disappear for long periods of time (either he had too many table or was horribly unorganized or both). It is too much to ask to have our meals arrive at the same time? Sadly what we paid for dinner is out of sync with the experience we had.
Camille B.,"San Francisco, CA",6,1,,1.0,9/9/2016,"The service is horrible. Why they gotta fight with me at cheesecake?  9 AM: ""Hi, can we make a reservation at 7:30?"" Waiter: ""Sorry, you'll have to call back after five."" 5:02 pm: ""Hi, can we make a reservation at 7:30?"" Waiter: ""Sorry, we can't make reservations after 5"" They wouldn't make the reservation..."
Yoonhee L.,"Washington, DC",2,19,19,3.0,5/31/2017,"The food was alright; my fiance had a double bacon burger and I had a four cheese pasta. Portions and taste were fine except our hostess and waitress took forever for everything we asked. We waited another 20 minutes after we turned in our buzzing remote. Once we got seated, we waited another 20 minutes for the waitress. We got our drinks and bread/butter at the same time our appetizer came out. Then when we asked for a box and check, it took another 20 minutes for that. Probably will not return!"
RACHEL M.,"San Jose, CA",1,189,13,4.0,11/16/2016,"I love the cheesecake factory. I don't even really like cheesecake. I really just go for their food-and occasionally a slice of the cheesecake which I have to admit it's pretty effing fabulous. As always, the portions are huge but always tasty. The last time I went I had this awesome bacon cheeseburger. So much bacon and cheese. Such delicious greasiness. Loved it. Minus one star for the slow seating-there was barely anyone in there on a weekday lunch and it took us quite a bit to get seated. I have to say, it was worth the wait!"
Happy C.,"San Ramon, CA",0,18,,4.0,12/8/2016,"We celebrate all of our family birthdays here. We generally order appetizers and save room for the CHEESECAKE. I would probably rate the service 3.5, however the catering and food in itself is deserving of a 4. Cheers!"
Joel R.,"Ventura, CA",180,100,297,4.0,5/4/2015,"We found ourselves at Stoneridge Mall again one Friday night and we decided to try The Cheesecake Factory. Now the last time we had eaten here was before we had such a restrictive diet so we didn't have to worry about what we ate. But I figured a place like Cheesecake Factory had to have something we can eat, even if we made substitutions and let the server know of our gluten-free, grain-free & sugar-free dietary needs. It took us a while to browse their menu because of how large it is, but also because we read almost every item & description carefully to see what was in it & what we can sub in or out. The server in our section looked pretty busy, but eventually another server came to our table to let us know that our actual server was backed up & that she would be helping out. She took our drink orders and gave us a few more minutes with the menu. Our server came up to us and apologized for the wait (Thank you!) We decided to order the steak, green beans, spinach, the 1/2 chicken & steamed carrots. We let the server know of our dietary restrictions and she said that she will definitely make a note on the order. (Thank you again!) We asked how all the veggies were cooked making sure there were no marinades or sauces. She said no that they were either steamed or just cooked in olive oil. For the chicken, it's supposed to have a sauce, but I asked if they could just cook the 1/2 chicken with no sauce, just plain. She said that was not problem! She was very friendly & very considerate of how ""picky"" we needed to be. As we waited for our food, the other server who was helping us as well, came up to us with a bread basket, and she said, ""I wasn't sure but I thought I'd ask..."" And we laughingly told her, ""No thank you, but you were definitely right that we didn't want the bread"" Our food came out and everything looked delicious! All the veggies were cooked perfectly. All we added was salt & pepper. Spinach & green beans were cooked in olive oil and the carrots were steamed plain. The steak was tender & juicy as well as the 1/2 chicken. Another woman who we assumed was the manager that evening came to our table to make sure that all our food was cooked accordingly and that there were no mistakes in the preparation. Before we left, we thanked our server for being considerate to our dietary needs. She informed us that they are definitely happy to accommodate and have been improving on being sensitive to customers with different restrictions. It's good to know that we can still go to a chain restaurant and find something on the menu and that the staff is friendly & helpful to accommodate such restrictions. Thank you Cheesecake Factory! Eat it... Love it... Yelp it!!!"
