Sofia A.,"Castro Valley, CA",403,156,294,4.0,7/2/2015,"The one thing I hate about Cheesecake Factory is that there are no reservations. Really don't understand why. Other than crazy long waits, this place is great. The location makes it nice b/c while you're waiting you can just walk around stoneridge and shop for a bit as long as you're paying attention to the time. This place is pretty standard as any Cheesecake Factory is. Same menu, same taste. It's always clean here. It's my favorite restaurant chain. The food is pretty expensive, but they give such large portions that it pretty much serves as two meals. I love so many things on this menu. They also have a good selection from American, to Italian, to Mexican, to Asian. Though if you want Asian food, this place is probably not the one to come to. Four stars b/c they don't take reservations. But I love this place nonetheless."
Ileen B.,"Tracy, CA",52,21,,1.0,5/14/2016,"Worst service EVER. From the very beginning our pager went off we went to the counter and we still had to wait by the counter for 10min. I asked why did the pager went off if they were having us still wait. Their excuse ""oh we are still cleaning the table."" Obviously you are not truly ready for us but they seated other ppl before us.  Then we sit at our table silverware dirty with left over food on the forks and water marks all over the knives and when our appetizers came  out it sat for 10min because we were waiting for silverware bcs apparently they have TONS of employees and TONS of customers and the kitchen doesn't have silverware for us, couldn't order salad bcs they were out of salad dressings. Really??!!! On a Saturday???  OMG this has been a bad joke.  Oh and manager NEVER came to our table even though I asked for one.... HORRIBLE!!!"
Valerie B.,"San Ramon, CA",1,34,,1.0,6/24/2017,"VERY poor service. I came at a time when it wasn't even very busy, 3:15, and had the worst service of my life. My waiter was not friendly, and I asked for bread FOUR times. I even had to ask someone who wasn't my waiter, and that got me nowhere. Meanwhile I saw a ton of bread baskets going around. He finally brought it out when they brought out my meal. So much for that holding me over until my entree came. My waiter was basically non-existent. I felt like I bothered him if I asked a question. He never came to check on me, or refill my drink. I understand it's a chain so they feel secure, but damn, that kind of service makes me never want to come back. Not worth it. Get some class, Cheesecake. Work on your customer service because after reading the other reviews that seems to be a common theme."
David N.,"Berkeley, CA",141,1012,883,2.0,2/18/2016,"Been here several times since my mommy enjoys the meatloaf. That's about the only thing I really ever enjoyed. Large servings, yes, but I just don't order the rights stuff. Fish'nChips with the batter that will bleed your mouth, pasta dishes that arrive with the sauce congealed, big fat dry burgers (no chili, BTW), and watery huevos rancheros with over done eggs. Servers try to be pleasant, but seemed overwhelmed. Finally, the ice tea comes with a sugar rim and of course, it melts and get your hands all sticky. I let my sister take mom and I stay home."
Beverly H.,"Pleasanton, CA",1,18,2,1.0,12/4/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory has always been ""average but now they are well below average because their service is the worst!  I called to place an order for sauces and a cake to be picked up the next day. I was put on hold for the bakery, then transferred back to front desk. I said I've been holding for 6 minutes for the bakery. They apologized,  said they would transfer me back, then disconnected me!  I called again and was successfully transferred. I spoke someone who placed my order. I felt like he wasn't reliable(just had a feeling) so I repeated my order and he confirmed. When my son went to pick it up today, not only did they NOT have my order ready, they couldn't find it. Then they said that they were low in the sauces and couldn't even let me buy them!  I was depending on the sauces for a fondue dinner party that I'm having tonight.  When I called to complain to the manager. I was put on hold for 10 minutes!  I decided to just write my experience in Yelp and hope I am forewarning anyone who is thinking about ordering from the Cheesecake Factory in Pleasanton. Don't do it!!"
John V.,"Hayward, CA",0,31,7,1.0,7/11/2016,Swatting flies during my meal. RUDE SERVICE!! My orange chicken had no glaze on it. Asked for bread and it never came. Took forever to take and receive order. When I say forever I mean FOREVER!! Worst Cheesecake Factory I ever eaten at!
Kathy B.,"Stockton, CA",26,30,114,5.0,3/5/2016,This place is super nice.. Highly recommend.. Food is absolutely Delish... Place get busy pretty quick but worth the wait.. Best Fried Calamari we've ever had..
John P.,"San Jose, CA",0,1,,1.0,1/6/2017,"I went here at night to grab a quick dessert to go, remembering that Linda's Fudge Cake is usually pretty good. I ended up wasting about 25 minutes and walked out empty-handed. After placing my order, I was told that specific cake was out of stock. Not too big of a deal, it happens. A substitute was recommended, so I went with that. I was told it would be out soon, ""5 minutes tops"". Well, 15 minutes later my name was finally called, and I was excited to finally have my ""quick"" dessert to go. Turns out, after all that time they found out that the recommended substitute was also out of stock. As I get to the counter they apologize, and ask if I want another cake or if I ""had my heart set on that one?"" Well obviously I didn't have my heart set on the backup THEY recommended, but I wasn't going to spend any more unnecessary minutes there. Soon a manager was over to cancel my charge, so I guess I should be happy I didn't have to pay for this incredible waste of my time."
Judy L.,"San Leandro, CA",128,232,178,1.0,2/14/2016,"The line is SO LONG here! ALL THE TIME. WHY???? I come here for lunch. There's a line. I come here for dinner. There's a line. I come here at 3pm. There's a line. My last visit here was the WORST. My sister and I ordered cheesecake to go. We ordered at 6pm. By 6:30pm, people who ordered after we did already received their cheesecake and left. I asked the lady to check on my order and she said they were backed up. Uh...don't you guys prepare the orders in the order you receive them?!?! It was so unorganized. I waited another 15 minutes and asked another lady. This time, she prepared the order herself. They don't even know what happened to my order...With all the time I spent waiting, I could have gotten a table here for dinner!"
Chayla G.,"San Leandro, CA",284,170,116,4.0,9/10/2016,"Food was good. Dessert of course was good. Service was pretty slow, I think they forgot we were there. Got soda and I think the carbonation was out because it was pretty flat."
Nicki F.,"Oakland, CA",218,446,73,3.0,8/3/2015,"30-minute wait around 4pm on a Saturday. Not too shabby! Too bad the alerts only go off when you're in the building. We wanted to roam around the mall while we waited but we couldn't do that.  The complimentary breads that come with the meals are pretty good. I personally prefer the sourdough bread but I know many prefer the sweeter oat bread.  Server and waiter were both professional and even tried to make small talk. Waiter constantly refilled our waters, packed our leftovers in boxes, and asked questions.   Chicken Potstickers ($10.50) - Very overpriced. You only get 5 and they're only okay. A tad too salty. You can buy cheaper (and probably better) ones at Costco.  Fried Portobello Mushrooms, Avocados, and Zucchini ($6.95) - Actually decent. It came with two sauces, both of which were good. The zucchini was the best of the three. Enough to share for 3-4. I would get this again if I come back. Tiramisu Cheesecake ($7.50) - Cheesecake was so so so good but the bottom coffee later was not so good. It was too bitter and more of a cake rather a crust. I really wish the cheesecake had a crust I could bite into.  S'more Galore Cheesecake ($7.95) - If you like graham crackers, marshmallows, and chocolate... Then you can't go wrong with this cheesecake. Creative display. Cheesecake is more of a chocolate displace but the crust is exceptional with chocolate chips lined on the outer crust.  The food at Cheesecake Factory isn't memorable, but their cheesecakes certainly are. We will come back here but solely for the cheesecake!"
Sam S.,"Livermore, CA",0,4,,1.0,1/5/2017,"If only I had the option to give zero stars.. Worst experience yet! Order take out and it took over and hour and a half to get the food!! OF COURSE when we got home from waiting an unnecessary amount of time for our food, it was cold like it wasn't even cooked! Ordered two entree's that come with bacon and there was no bacon on it..  What the heck??? I will never go back. This place is a jokeeeeeeee."
Mary L.,"Hayward, CA",0,2,2,1.0,2/16/2016,"Curbside delivery quite disappointing food burnt, please check your order before you leave.  Cheesecake order wrong as well.  A picture is worth a thousand words."
Stephanie D.,"Atherton, CA",576,774,301,4.0,2/2/2016,"So, after a regrettably terribly, un fun no good experience at a Cheesecake factory in 2014 I've been on a hiatus from their restaurants until one of my girlfriends suggested a different location of theirs for lunch.  We waited about 20 minutes to sit which was fine considering that it was noon on a weekend.  Our server Kevin was really kind, he was totally efficient and was kind about our random requests.  I loved my chicken and avocado sandwich! We didn't need much help after we received our food and everything tasted great so we were happy all around, much nicer than my last experience!"
Jovian C.,"Fremont, CA",63,1,,5.0,1/1/2017,"The reason I gave this all five stars was because of my waitress Tosha. Even though the restaurant was packed and we got the food pretty late, she was very kind and thankful that my party and I were being patient. She let my party and I feel welcomed by being nice and being helpful whenever we required her assistance. Tosha, in general, was an amazing waitress for her service, and for that, I thank her!"
Kent B.,"Modesto, CA",50,78,83,2.0,3/3/2015,"I was expecting quality service and quality food. PF Chang might have been a better experience since everyone was flocking into The Cheesecake Factory to only get let down by poor qualty service and food.  Great service and great food come hand in hand to really experience a fine restaurant. However, this Cheesecake Factory was unacceptable.  The welcomeness wasn't there. Sundays are the busiest day in the week especially popular restaurants.  The restaurant was pretty filthy. The tables weren't wipe down, napkins from the previous diners still near my seat. Silverware with dried soap marks, hot water on a clean cloth to buffer out the residue could  solve that, but nope the server brings us crusty silverware.  Our server was very inattentive. Very chatty with his ""homie"" but failed to stop by our table to ask if our main dishes came out great. He keeps bringing us new cups of water in exchange for our full glass of water. Maybe this was his idea of attentive service.   My gf's pasta dish was unbearable, she had the Evelyn's Favorite Pasta, the chicken had this icey wetnesd in the center and was so dry. The pasta looked like it has been sitting because the texture was chewy. The nastiest part was the signature bell pepper and purple eggplants, yummmm, NOT. Think again. The bell pepper look used and abused, and the eggplant looked sautéed until thr eggplants shribbled like a scrotum.   My bang bang  was edible, yes, but pleasurable? No. I chose this dish for its curry blend with coconut and nuts with a chicken and shrimp. I think the menu needs to be reworded to describe the bang bang. Basically my dish was a thick blend of curry (maybe yellow), coconut flakes (which didnt blend well, if they had done coconut milk it would be better), and the nuts didnt go well with the coconut flakes.  Ugly dish with mushy mango bits in the  middle with cold rice in the center. The scary thing is, my bang bang looked nothing like the picture thats on their website. Don't laugh at my turd looking bang bang.  What's up  with the lighting? Is it me or its super dim inside.  Pros:  + Appetizers were tastey and affordable  + Small plates and appetizers presentation + food quality was on point Cons:  - poor restaurant service  - filthy silverware  - inattentive restaurant staff - food quality was weak  Good for first dates? No. Skip the dining in experience and order some cheesecake TOGO. after all thays what they're known for right. Not shribbled  veggies and overcooked food."
Jim L.,"Dublin, CA",0,9,,1.0,7/4/2017,"We visited this location at 6:06pm.  We only ordered a 4 cheese pasta and a vegetable chop salad.  Although assured that our order would be ready in less than 30 mins it took almost an hour.  As we saw bags arrive at the cashier we checked and they told us that our order was still in the back.  So we waited.  At 55 mins we stood in line to cancel our order at which time the called my name.  I told them that the order took longer than it should.  All the cashier did was say sorry.  When we arrived at the car we found our pasta cold.  Our food had sat by the register for who knows how long.  When earlier we tried to get another cashier's attention the women acted as if we weren't there.  I have been a big fan of this restaurant and we were even going to order a slice of cheesecake when our order was called, we left instead.  I won't be back to this location."
Fereen A.,"Hayward, CA",17,86,326,2.0,4/18/2016,"We came here on a Sunday for lunch. The place was busy. The wait was about 15-20mins. We were seated outside, which was really nice in a beautiful weather. It took them a while to bring us our water and coke and the bread took a while as well.We started out with the chicken samosas, which was ok. Our food took forever to come, I literally lost my appetite just waiting for the food. My husband had the dip bit beef with fries and I had the chicken enchilada. The only thing that I enjoyed from my plate was the rice. I didn't enjoy the rest of my food at all. It felt dry and tasteless. The waitress was friendly and made sure we were doing ok. I don't think I would go back."
Teresa V.,"Hayward, CA",79,23,85,5.0,10/22/2016,I love the crispy chicken cotaletta and the lemon sauce that's on it and of corse the cheese cake is amazing. The lemon Meringue and can't forget the salted caramel one to die for
Lisa T.,"Ripon, CA",11,97,309,5.0,8/19/2015,"Always a great time!! The wait on a weekend is helatious.. But, if you know this little sct it won't (Hopefully) be so bad So drop your name at the RSVP counter Scoot over to the Bar, get your beverage from the bartender yourself and do a quick sweep of where ppl might be in their dining time frame. POLITELY ASK if they look like they are leaving soon.. Just be ready to get a look if done wrong  BUT DEFF NO RUSH. Do not be pushy I have never had a difficult one. If you don't mind a pub style (casual) dining in the Bar area ok for tweeners, (not too young)..seats are wood and high Remember to tell RSVP to remove your name and enjoy adult beverage while the BUS your table and your sever will be rt with you..try some Chicken Picate it's tasty they serve fresh delicious bread too! Remember the cheesecake to go!!"
