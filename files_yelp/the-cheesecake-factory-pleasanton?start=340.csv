Andi M.,"Los Angeles, CA",26,56,38,2.0,11/22/2016,"1 star for edible food 1 star for cleanliness and nice environment Summary: food is fine if you're willing to wait a REALLY long time with sub par service. next time I get a Cheesecake Factory gift card, I'm re-gifting that sucker.  Review is for lunchtime: tried to place an order for pickup at 11:50am on a Tuesday. Was placed on hold 17 minutes the first call and being sent straight to hold the next 2 times I called without an explanation. Went in to place order in person (have had a gift card I've been wanting to use for a year). When I got there, people that had placed their orders at the counter said they'd been waiting for about 30 minutes for their food. Super long wait for people waiting to be seated. Dismissive host desk staff.  To-go food order was not totally accurate and took about 30 minutes because the manager ""sped it through""."
Ryan K.,"San Leandro, CA",0,4,,5.0,6/30/2017,"Walked into a moderately busy restaurant, put my self down for a table for two. As I was waiting though a server named Chris greeted us and made sure we would get seated right away. Chris is the type of employee you want he was""getting after it!"". His impeccable service coupled with his hard work ethic was impressive and appreciated. I'll be coming back, and asking to sit in Chris's section!"
Blake L.,"Las Vegas, NV",134,260,11,3.0,4/2/2016,"I usually enjoy Cheesecake Factory, but this location has too many flaws. They take way too long seating everyone and the staff is unorganized. Food is usually really good, but the wait service is not so great. Cheesecake is always solid."
Malia B.,"San Ramon, CA",0,9,,2.0,6/9/2017,"I'm giving just 2 stars as an overall review for last couple years it's been pretty up &down with service and food etc... It is a very busy location,this area in particular, is always busy when dining out!! Annoying. Yes. Anyway- what is confusing is why they like to sit everyone in a row on those bench like tables elbow to elbow? Weird to me.We just ask for a booth when not in the mood to share dinner convos.! There's usually enough seating elsewhere but they like to cram everyone together like cows at a feeding trough..lol (We only go for early dinners as to avoid the crowds). Today waitress was great,bread was served promptly (I was surprised),drinks came fast and dinner was fine...Salads were wilted though.The cheesecake was underwhelming. It just didn't have the same rich dense taste I was used to.Tasted like whipped cheesecake,I don't know it was weird. And small.Portions used to be bigger...  In the past service was really slow and just not up to standard for me multiple times,so 2 stars all in all.I will go back and try different cheesecake,we'll see, maybe it was a bad batch."
Del F.,"Brentwood, CA",72,28,17,1.0,4/22/2017,"This is by far the worst Cheesecake Factory restaurant. I tried to give it another try from the last experience but same thing. No customer service whatever. The servers are by the far worst and they don't care to come back to ask if you need anything. We waited 40 minutes to get seated, which isn't that bad considering there's always a lot of people there. When we sat down our server didn't even come to greet herself or himself. We flagged someone down after sitting there for 20 minutes, and then come to find out she was our server. Her name was Andrea. She asked us what we needed and I mentioned we'd like to order. She abruptly asked one of my sisters what they wanted to order. Didn't apologize for not getting helped or nothing. Her response was, what do you want, and abruptly tried to go through everyone on my table. Then as she was done taking our order she was leaving and we flagged her down again because she didn't even ask us what we wanted to drink. She took that down and left. Almost 15 minutes later we asked if we could at least have bread. And she came back 7 minutes later with bread but we had no utensils or plates so we asked for some. We somehow ate our bread with butter with no utensils. Our drinks came shortly after that but she still didn't bring us utensils. Our food came almost 40 minutes after ordering however we didn't get our appetizer! When we were done with our meal she mentioned they were still making our calamari...and we asked to cancel the order. She came back stating oh we already cancelled that for you. Ummmmm how are you going to cancel our calamari when we didn't even ask you to???? And not bother even telling us? Quickly after that, we asked for the check which came out in like a minute after asking for it. That's probably the only thing they did rt we're assuming! Quick to get you out and pay for your food! We checked our bill.... and whattya know? Calamari is still being charged. This took another 20 minutes to get taken off!!!! Never again. By the worst Cheesecake Factory ever. Take the extra drive for quality service at Walnut Creek!"
Barbara G.,"Livermore, CA",0,6,,2.0,5/14/2017,Just left Cheesecake Factory for Mother's Day.  The wait was nearly two hours before being seated even though the hostess stated it would be only an hour and fifteen minutes.  Next time if the hostess says it'll be longer than 30 minutes ----it will be time to leave.....
Alex D.,"San Leandro, CA",37,15,,1.0,11/28/2016,Back in the 2010 2014 the was a good restaurant with people who wanted to work and feel pride of their company people who care who own their shift who put their name in the plate but now it feels nothing of it but just worker with upset or tired face. Our dish tonight was not upstanding they are sacrifying   quality and recipes adherence. The service was the other point we just see our waiter pass by too many time but not said anything while waiting about 45 minutes we felt ignore the whole time that we were sat at empty table.     They have opportunities ahead of them
lisa g.,"Livermore, CA",10,65,34,1.0,10/16/2016,well I think it is just impossible for them to get anything right...the process although better than before but this time they got my order wrong ... i wanted a crispy shrimp sandwich and got chicken. Asked for bread and butter didn't get it..no more coming to this location we are done!!!
Andy C.,"San Lorenzo, CA",144,16,2,1.0,1/11/2015,"Been eating here for awhile now. One time I received an unwashed knife. Then the manager came and exchange the knife for me and apologize. I gave them a chance to, since things like that may sometime happen. But now, my water have a freaking fly in it!!! They sure do need to have another annual inspection soon.  Horrible quality sigh, disappointed...."
Bonnie A.,"Riverbank, CA",55,9,,3.0,11/23/2016,"I've been to the Cheesecake Factory before and loved it, but today's visit left a lot to be desired. I was there only for 4 slices of cheesecake. There were multiple people complaining of missing or messed up orders.  When it came to be our turn, our order was also messed up. We waited 20 minutes.  The man who gave us our order said sorry.  We'd had our choices ready and no one had to wait for us to order which I thought was a courtesy but it still just added to the chaos I guess.  It seemed like everyone there didn't know what was going on.  It was a disappointing visit."
Lovely V.,"San Francisco, CA",11,52,40,3.0,4/13/2016,Not the best Cheesecake Factory service. Wait was long even though there weren't a lot of customers waiting.
Maggie X.,"Phoenix, AZ",129,384,4865,3.0,12/28/2013,"I've had some of my worst dining experiences at Cheesecake Factories, but this time was surprisingly an exception. I still don't get the hype for this place (especially the location in San Francisco), but I do like this location enough to venture back for lunch - although only for lunch.  I like the decor of this restaurant in general; it's a nice and intimate setting with dim lights and both table and booth seating. What usually distracts from enjoying a dining experience here are the outrageously long lines (I've waited up to four hours for a table of three before) and lackluster wait staff.  This time though, my mom and I came for lunch within half an hour of opening. There was no wait, and we were seated at a corner table. Our waiter, Dave M., was incredibly thoughtful and attentive, even going so far as to offer a sample of the soup of the day when I wasn't sure what butterbean was.  Complimentary molasses and sourdough bread: ( ) Each meal is prefaced with a basket of molasses and sourdough bread, and I much prefer the former to the latter. It's pretty good bread, soft and spongy on the inside and crispy on the outside. It also comes with butter on the side.  Renee's lunch special with garden salad, half a turkey sandwich, and butterbean soup: ( ) The garden salad came with mixed greens and roma tomatoes. They were fresh, although the tomato pieces were cut quite large. The turkey sandwich had a good amount of sliced turkey and was quite tasty, although a little dry. The butterbean soup was delicious; it was made with bacon, butter beans, and kale. It was a little salty, but the flavor was really good.  Renee's lunch special with butterbean soup, half a chicken salad sandwich, and fries instead of salad: ( ) My mom opted for the chicken salad sandwich, and it came on toasted bread slices with chicken salad tossed with mayonnaise and lettuce inside. I had a bite of this, and it was a little too heavy for my taste. The chicken pieces were a little sparse, and the lettuce was weighed down by the heavy sauce. Instead of getting salad, my mom got fries, which were pretty standard. They were cut a little bit thicker than fast food fries, although not thick enough to be steak fries.  I think the lunch specials are a pretty good deal, and I'd come again at lunchtime when the wait isn't as long."
Lisa S.,"Fremont, CA",192,353,766,4.0,5/18/2014,"I always get great service when it comes to the cheesecake factory! They always have me feeling satisfied & feeling great. The entrees are great but their dessert selection is what I like best! It just so happens to be that cheesecake is my favorite dessert! Well anyways, my cousin and I came here for dessert & cocktails after her bday dinner. We quickly sat ourselves bar side &; the waiter was quick to assist us. We ordered my favorite red velvet while she ordered the her usual the white chocolate macadamia cheesecake. To accommodate us we order two cocktails,  the Caribbean cooler & the strawberry daquari. We paid after we sat there and talked for a few hours & both left happy and satisfied customers!"
Frances C.,"Castro Valley, CA",60,227,729,2.0,5/14/2015,"We arrived 5 mins before the happy hour and would have to wait until  the happy hour kick off to be served.  The service is v-e-r-y s---l--o--w even though it is not extremely busy.  The happy hour drinks tasted like juice.  The nacho is really bad when the chips are still stale after being baked in the oven.  The mac and cheese ball is a bit over cheesy, with no flavor to the sauce.  Tex Mex roll was the only item that's good with a little heat. Quite disappointed that the quality of service and food is gone.  It used to be our favorite place."
Maddie G.,"Pleasanton, CA",0,5,1,2.0,6/9/2017,"This place can get very busy and it is not handled well. The service was terrible. They kept us waiting twenty minutes longer than they said it would and the hostesses had major attitude when we asked how much longer the wait would be when we were waiting longer than the time they gave us. Once we were seated it took a very long time for the waiter to take our drink orders and in between the meal. However, the cheesecake is delicious."
Sophia Y.,"Pleasanton, CA",222,264,736,3.0,12/31/2013,"The menu is bad for the indecisive people. It's like stimulus overload. What cuisine or kinds of foods does this menu not have?! And the portions are ginormous. A plate can easily satisfy 2 people. It's impossible not to order a cheesecake for dessert at a place that has cheesecake in its name though, so I always end up leaving very, very full.  The wait for this restaurant is ridiculous since it's in a mall and very popular. It can be up to an hour wait. Be sure to let your foreign friends know that Cheesecake Factory serves actual food and not just cheesecake though. ;) Love their complimentary rye bread, though you might have to ask for it nowadays. Most of their dishes are high in calories, so I appreciate that they have a ""skinny"" menu for those watching their intake. Their Pasta Da Vinci and Chicken Madeira was really good, if you don't like creamy sauces like me. I also liked their Grilled Chicken Tostada Salad. They have a separate menu for brunch items.  I have found that although they have practically everything under the sun on their menu, they don't really excel in anything. Except for maybe cheesecake...and drinks. Love getting their sangria and mojitos here! The cheesecakes are super decadent and filling. it's a cheesecake, what did you expect? I usually stick with classic and simple and get the strawberry cheesecake with a cup of black coffee to offset the sugar-overload. Even with an order of dessert, the bill still comes out relatively inexpensive for how much food you're getting."
Kim S.,"Pleasanton, CA",119,19,1,1.0,10/31/2016,"Came in to buy a cheesecake to go and was told they were out of the 6' original. No problem, bought the 6' cherry instead. Purchased and waiting, and told that they were out of the 6' cherry, but could get the 7' instead. For an additional cost of $1.00. I'm being charged a whole dollar for a mistake their cashier made? And not offered my return receipt or even an apology from the manager for the mistake? Not cool Cheesecake Factory, not cool."
Heeyoung K.,"San Ramon, CA",9,7,,4.0,5/17/2016,"Great Food. I love this place. The wait line is always about 30mins. Except for that, my kids love it. I can go it every day If I can.  Here is my food list; Chinese Chicken salad Luau salad Small Ceaser salad (like side dish) Pasta with shrimp and sausage( hot spicy) Cajun Jambalaya pasta Bang Bang chicken  Avocado egg roll strawberry lemonade I want to try a lot more.  I can't skip the Cheesecake!!! Banana cream cheesecake is GREAT!"
Mike P.,"San Ramon, CA",0,7,,1.0,6/3/2017,"This place has really gone down hill in the past 12 months. My last 3 visits have all been really disappointing. My last visit being the worst.  After the usual wait for a table, which is expected due to the popularity. Our server took our order.  45 mins later our 6 main courses arrived.  4 of them were totally stone cold, and I mean not even a trace of heat.  Doesn't the kitchen or servers even check.  Our server didn't come by once during the 45 min wait for drinks refills.  Sorry Cheesecake, but we won't be returning for a long time, spoiled the evening totally."
Elizabeth K.,"Pleasanton, CA",22,9,3,5.0,6/3/2016,"My family and I love this place! The wait is a bit long, but that just means they're busy. And if they're busy, that means the food is good. I order something different every time, and it never disappoints my cravings. There's always plenty of bread for us to munch on while we wait, and the drink/dessert menu is excellent!  Here's a tip for newcomers... if you're absolutely starving and waiting for a table, the walk up line by the cheesecakes will happily take your order for a beverage or appetizer while you wait. You can eat a snack before you are seated for the main event!"
