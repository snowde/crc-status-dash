Javier P.,"San Leandro, CA",290,501,1782,4.0,11/27/2013,"I'm not really fond of The Cheesecake Factory. The first time I ate here, I couldn't make up my mind on what I wanted to eat. I mean, the menu has a lot to choose from, but nothing caught my eye. Today I ate here again with a few family members. Even though I was hungry, nothing on the menu was mouth watering to me. Mostly everything is overpriced and some of you yelpers will agree with me.  I'm not a big fan of cheesecake, but for the holidays I buy the Kahlua Cocoa Coffee Cheesecake. You erve 12-15 people. It appears to be my whole family's favorite. Damn coffee addicts! Even the little ones lol Aside from buying a whole cheesecake for the family. I wouldn't come back to eat here unless someone invites me. I can't say no to free food :)"
Zoey R.,"San Ramon, CA",0,26,,1.0,11/30/2016,"Thats the last time I go to the Cheesecake Factory. 1st time I went I got a pork sandwich that had ice crystals and was frozen in the middle. So I had the waiter take it back and I left. 2nd time i got crab cakes that only tasted like celery. I sent it back and I left. 3rd time I just went to get cheesecake. 3 slices that are not made on the premise that came to 27 dollars. I get home and they all taste off. Like they have been frozen and thawed way too many times and they all resemble the same flavor. Like when you go to a restaurant and get a coke and it has the diet coke, 7up, every soda combo. So I do not recommend this place. Instead of having 12 pages of menu of terrible food focus on a few things and make them great. I mean Cheesecake Factory should mean decent cheesecake. Disappointed."
Mitos E.,"Pleasanton, CA",202,45,271,1.0,9/8/2016,"Used to love this place, until tonight. We called to make reservations for 8 people. They said they dont take reservations, but just come in and they will just get us seated. They didnt  tell us that there will be a long waiting while at the phone. So we drove there, we checked in and the lady said wait at the lobby and they will let us know how long we have to wait, waited 10 minutes and receptionist approached us again just to let us know it's an 1 1/2 hour long to wait. We just waited about half an hour driving and waiting, while they can just  told us over  the phone that there will be a long wait. This people are so unprofessional and so snotty. I don't know if i will ever gonna come back here, i am really disappointed. Not good at all!"
Dave N.,"Woodbridge, CA",14,66,398,2.0,1/29/2016,"I have mixed feelings about this place based on the last time we came here. We came here early to beat the lunch crowd. When I say early, I mean around 11:20am. There were plenty of seats and we were pretty much seated instantly. For the place to be as dead as it was, it was a little awkward getting greeted by our waitress after 10-15 minutes of waiting around. We saw other waiters and waitresses helping out other tables but apparently our table was apart of another server's section. She apologized and told us about how she had to defuse a situation in her section. We again thought it was really weird that she only had us to wait on, and her main section was located in a different part of the restaurant. No worries, we told her. We eventually got to ordering and after a long wait our food finally came out. During the wait, the restaurant started filling up until literally the place was packed. During the waiting time we started noticing our waitress start to forget that she was assigned that 1 table in that whole other section (our section). When our food came out, there were parts of the dish that were warmer than other parts. This was something I was able to overlook because my food still tasted great. I went with the Parmesan-Herb Crusted chicken which was 3 sautéed chicken breast, green beans and mashed potatoes. I figured I would try something new. I've always gone with the orange chicken for the past couple of years eating here at all locations. The only place I had eaten a Parmesan Crusted Chicken was at BJs Brewery. With Cheesecake Factory having so many dishes, it's always been hard to specialize and hone in on each dish that comes out of the kitchen. I thought my food I ate was delicious and rivaled well with the Parmesan Crusted Chicken I had at BJs. I'm also happy they didn't hold back on the vegetables. Only complaint about my meal was an inconsistent temperature across the items, and the juice from the chicken mixed in with the vegetables made for an unnecessary crossing of flavors that didn't work too well together.  While I enjoyed my meal, my girl's experience with her plate was a complete 180 Degree Turn. She went for the Jumbo Shrimp combo. Her french fries weren't hot, or warm at all, they were actually cold. The shrimp itself wasn't even warm at all. She was beyond disappointed. It's all bad when you can eat your meal and almost predict how everything went in the kitchen. It was obvious her plate was done first, they cooked mine, and put on the hottest thing on my plate (green beans) last, then the plates were sitting out for awhile. After our food was brought out, our waitress was completely MIA at this point. She didn't come back to check on us, and even if we wanted to complain about how cold my lady's food was, no one was checking on us at all. I had to flag down a waiter helping the table right next to us, to ask him to get us the check. We didn't want to wait another 30 minutes for them to re-cook my girl's food.  Sad to say this location is a flop. You try to get here on a day at a reasonable to get seated and served on time. This place only half way delivered. On a regular weekend day, don't be surprised if your wait time is 25 minutes to an hour. For God's sake get your shit situated with what employees are working what areas. It was awkward for us watching other waiters and waitresses being attentive to our tables and us not seeing our waitress at all because all of her tables are elsewhere. It wasn't just strange for us, other guests were noticing that it came off like we were getting ignored."
Cheryl B.,"Millbrae, CA",17,20,2,1.0,10/2/2016,"Oh my, this restaurant location is NOT WORTH the wait nor the multitude of lies! We were quoted a time of 30 minutes to be seated which ultimately turned out to be 1 hour and 35 minute wait. We definitely checked on our quote time after 30 min wait and was requoted another 20 minutes, then after waiting was told that our table was being set. Then after 60 minutes was told that they actually told us our wait time was originally quoted as 1 hour and 15 minutes!!! They were actually waiting for an adjoining table to leave before they sat us for the room! They were not leaving so they finally offered us another table location!!!! So, after being seated they offered us free appetizers for the unfortunate wait. Nice recovery, NO NOT REALLY! Next lie, my son wanted fried calamari for an appetizer. Waiter told him, ""Sorry they were sold out of that""! LIE! When going to the bathroom, I noticed 2 other tables served fried calamari!!!! One star, for finally having lunch, I mean early dinner!!!!  GO TO PFCHANGS,next door, NEXT TIME!!!!"
Lupe F.,"Pleasanton, CA",36,1,,1.0,5/22/2017,"Awful customer service, the manager tried to make up for the multiple mistakes however he ended up making it worse. This will be our most memorable outing because of how awful it was. Way to go Cheesecake Factory!"
Camille C.,"Bothell, WA",482,833,1878,1.0,11/5/2014,"AN HOUR & 45 MIN wait on a Tuesday after we were told 45 minutes. SMDH. The hosts & ""manager"" were absolutely disorganized.  They knew they were wrong & because none of them ESPECIALLY the ""manager"" was trying to hard to avoid eye-contact with any of the people in our group. This ""manager"" was a lady that was dressed in all gray & I didn't catch her name because I honestly couldn't care less what her name was because I just wanted to be seated after waiting that long. Let's be real, Cheesecake Factory isn't a restaurant I would wait that long to be seated at. Very ridic. The only person who saved them from getting ripped a new one by every single person in my group was LUIS, our waiter. I am pretty sure they warned him about what they had just put us through, as far as wait time. ONLY BECAUSE his service was beyond perfect. lol. I am just saying. THANKS LUIS FOR THE AMAZING SERVICE, the rest of your staff needs to learn from you. I apologize if we were a little short with you, but we were HANGRY & IRRITATED at the people in front."
K C.,"Danville, CA",0,52,,1.0,6/2/2017,Returned only because they gave me a gift card. I ordered chicken sliders they were dry over cooked they were not cheap either. I will not return.
Jenny C.,"San Leandro, CA",132,109,53,3.0,12/29/2015,"It's so dark in here! Boo, no good foodie pictures :( Be prepared to wait. I came here for dinner, and the wait was about 45 minutes. Good thing there's the mall right next to it; time flies when you're shopping! My friends and I started off with the calamari appetizer. Yum! Definitely recommend. Every time I come here, I always get the Pasta DaVinci. I can never go wrong with that. However, this time, I was feeling adventurous and decided to try something new. I got the Grilled Steak Medallions, which is basically four circular ""medallions"" shaped beef slices on top of mashed potatoes surrounded by a sauce with asparagus, tomatoes, and mushrooms. The mashed potatoes were delicious and creamy. (Well, I'm a potato fanatic so I don't complain much when it comes to potatoes) The sauce, though, was extremely salty. To make matters worse, the mashed potatoes and steak were swimming in it so there was no escaping the salty-ness of the dish. The portions were pretty big, so I didn't have room for cheesecake. But I recommend the White Chocolate Raspberry cheesecake to anybody! It's the only one I ever get, and I swear by it!"
Richard O.,"Castro Valley, CA",0,2,,4.0,9/15/2017,"Always go to this Cheesecake Factory at least twice a year with a friend on our birthdays. Before going this time decided to read some of the recent reviews ... and was very surprised to read a lot of negative comments, particularly regarding service. Then I remembered last time there, the service was slow, particularly long time to get entree. So we decided to look at the menu online before going and order as soon as our server greeted us and asked about drinks. Arrived right at 7 on a Thursday night and ... NO WAIT! we were seated in a booth immediately. Been going to this location for 10+ years and have ALWAYS had to wait for a table, especially at 7 pm dinner hour. We ordered as soon as our server arrived and glad we did ... food took exactly 1/2 hour to arrive at table. Entree's were good ... I had to send the fries back as they weren't warm enough, and the cheesecake was excellent as always. Service was prompt and attentive. So, will definitely go back, and will do as this time in checking menu online and ordering as soon as seated. It really helped cut some of the wait time."
Morgan F.,"Fremont, CA",69,99,271,4.0,12/26/2015,"I seriously love this place! Always a bit crowded, but worth the wait.  They have everything under the sun on their menu. I've had their pot stickers, buffalo blasts, cashew chicken, their cornbread appetizer thingy, southwestern egg rolls, steaks, won ton puff things, etc.  My favorites are definitely the luau chicken salad (every bite is filled with fresh deliciousness) and their country fried chicken sliders (get buffalo sauce on the side and make mini buffalo chicken sandwiches). Sooooo good! I definitely recommend those!  And their cheesecake is, of course, phenomenal! Can't go wrong with any option really.  Ask for Mariah when you go. Best server I've had there. The other servers are good too (I think I've only had one that was horrible), but she is on top of her serving game. Always brought refills without asking, was prompt, brought our food out hot, super good personality, etc. She just seemed to be a really hard worker. She's good at her job. Won't be disappointed with her service.  Drinks are a bit pricy which stinks. Between that and the busy-ness, I rank this place 4 stars over 5.  Same ambiance as all cheesecakes. This location is better than valley fair if you ask me. Go check it out!"
Kathe R.,"Danville, CA",0,30,,1.0,11/15/2016,Lunch on Monday was busy with a typical 30 minute wait. Our waitress seemed overworked as it took an hour to receive our order of a chicken and a shrimp sandwich. The sweet potato fries were missing and they did bring them burnt after the meal was over. The shrimp was overlooked and chewy and the bread was very hard and burnt. A $15 sandwich should be tasty. No apologies from the waitress I guess this is common. We won't return.
Kasey B.,"Oakland, CA",1,18,1,2.0,4/10/2016,"What happened to you Cheesecake Factory??  You used to be my favorite weekend place.  Now, not at all.  Today was our 4th bad experience in a row.    My fave dish, endive salad with salmon was taken off the menu a few months ago so I ordered the salmon kale salad for $14.95.  The salmon looks like someone cut it in half or in a third before serving.  Pic below.  I've had every salmon dish on the menu and never had an issue with portion size.  In the last 4 visits I've been served under cooked salmon, received the wrong order, gotten my food 25 minutes after my friend and waited over an hour after ordering.  The love affair is over.  Why even 2 stars you ask?  Servers are generally are nice."
Jack F.,"Vallejo, CA",0,4,,1.0,5/15/2017,"Really bad service. Waited over 35 minutes at our table after ordering, waiter came out and told us that our order had been forgotton. When I asked him how much longer, all he said was, ""I dont know."" We left shortly after that without eating. Waited over an hour (includes waiting for a table) for nothing. Barely got an apology from the waiter. Will not be coming back to this cheesecake factory. If possible, you should go to the one in Walnut Creek."
Hunter L.,"Modesto, CA",104,23,26,1.0,9/12/2016,Such shitty service I cannot believe it. First off the lady told me 10 to 15 minutes and so we said okay and got a pager and it went off in two minutes. But they put the wrong pager off and we ended up waiting 40 more minutes! And we found a table at the open seating so I asked to hostess how much longer for a table and she said she really didn't know! So irritated and it took us 15 to end up getting someone to help us. So mad
Spencer G.,"Pleasanton, CA",247,122,1,4.0,9/23/2016,Their food portion sizes are ridiculously large above and beyond what your average person could eat but their desserts are the reason to visit this place. The plethora of cheesecake flavors is the reason people keep coming back for more. Highly recommend the oreo and snickers cheesecake flavors as these are magnificent. Also a very nice bar with a seemingly good selection of alcohol as well. Will be coming back if the crowd isn't too much to bear.
Truvell Y.,"Oakland, CA",0,17,6,2.0,7/3/2016,"We were seated to a table was not set with silverware.  When I asked a waiter for silverware and bread plates he just sat the stuff on the table with somewhat of an attitude.  So it seems that the staff is not adequately prepairing the silverware roll ups tonight that are the usual for this place.  As well, we were informed that the kitchen ran out of bread.  A restraunt should never run out of bread.  The kitchen was definately moving in a low gear.  Like granny.  Our waiter Tyler was good.  He did well considering the circumstances."
Stephanie S.,"Sacramento, CA",91,7,16,1.0,3/21/2017,"I was extremely disappointed today with our server. After we placed our order the server did no acknowledge us in ANY way. Not only did she not check on us if we wanted water refills or fresh cheese with our meals, she also NEVER brought my drink I ordered. At the end of our meal I informed her to take my drink off, she couldn't even apologize for forgetting the drink. I was so mortified. I've never experienced crap service from this place until yesterday. She dropped off our check and left. My friend literally took our checks to a manager and had him check us out. It was so ridiculous. I come to this location very often and never have I ever had this horrible of service. All we wanted was just acknowledgement which she has no remorse after all of that."
Amanda G.,"Brentwood, CA",0,23,2,2.0,9/9/2017,"The food was delicious, as always. However the food is good no matter which Cheesecake Factory you go to so i highly recommend any one but this one. The only person that had a smile on her face during the experience was the host. She was pleasant, greeted us very warmly and we got seated right away. Everything from then on was downhill, we got seated in the sun and it was impossible to even read the menus, so we waited 5 minutes for our server, Trinity, to come to our table and then asked if we could move to a table in the shade (there were two right next to us) she seemed very irritated at this question but allowed us to move. She had what came off as a very poor attitude. She complained to us (and then proceeded to complain to 2 other tables that i heard) about how disorganized the set up was and that they had too many people outside for the amount of servers, which i found very unprofessional and also kind of took it as the amount of customers were inconviencing her. We then overheard her get in an arguement with another server over who's tables belonged to who, which again, was very unprofessional. Trinity apologized for the arguement however her apology seemed insincere. All in all she seemed extremely disgruntled about everything that day and made it a poor experience. It took so long between each stage (being seated, ordering, getting our drinks, getting our food) that by the time the food came we were kind of just ready to go. I'll stick with the Walnut Creek location from now on"
Susie Z.,"Livermore, CA",95,123,16,3.0,2/21/2016,"Anyone who has frequents this place often knows how crazy the wait can be. That is the only thing that is consistent here, the wait.  Everything else is hit or miss, so I can only say that you need to learn to fend for yourself in the madness that is the Stoneridge Mall Cheesecake Factory.  Food is hit or miss, so you can only trial and error. There are hit and misses for every kind of food. Some god awful salads like the Asparagus Salad, some great like the Santa Fe salad. Same for burgers, and pasta. I don't order chicken dishes since I can make those pretty easily at home. Service is REALLY hit or miss. Maybe theres a really high turnover? Sometimes we get great servers who know what they're doing or sometimes (like today) they will mess up on all of the orders. Even the hosts messed up our seating arrangement and we had to wait an extra 15 min to be seated after 30 min. Make sure to check in and make sure they know if you have a preference for outside or inside seating. However, one thing that I do like is how nice their manager was when I needed to say something about my last visit, when literally everything went wrong from the seating process, the food, and the service. She was understanding and was helpful. (Lady who looked more like a nice boutique owner.) This is a nice place to meet friends or grab a bite to eat while shopping. Just don't go in with high expectations."
