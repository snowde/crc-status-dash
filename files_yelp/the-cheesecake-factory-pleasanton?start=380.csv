Kyoko T.,"Livermore, CA",37,28,22,2.0,6/29/2016,"Never go against your own judgement. I said never again last time when I was here. Today that now was renewed. It was freezing cold, and noisy, and takes forever to get your order. I had fish and chips. Their lunch special. All four pieces of fish had not quite cooked through batter on one side. The cook did not flip the fish while flying. Never again."
Nina H.,"Fremont, CA",21,160,1590,3.0,1/30/2016,"This location is not as good as valley fair. We came in at 5:30pm and got notified that the wait was about 1hr and 10 min. So we decided to wait. We got our seat till 6:50pm. 10 min after we were seated, no one came!!! And even that waters came, it took her forever to get us drink or bread! And it took us even longer to order the food!!! After we finished our food, she never brought us the box for leftover take out or desert menu! We have to ask other waitress for a check! And before we left，that waitress just came and said , sorry, I am just too busy today (... That's the main reason why it took us over one hour for waiting in line!) we came out of this restaurant after 9pm. Probably we won't come to this Cheesecake Factory branch again."
Erin J.,"Redwood City, CA",275,320,6,3.0,3/7/2015,"I remember being exceedingly excited when this Cheesecake Factory opened. I was pretty young, and I used to really love cheesecake.  Anyways, nothing fancy about this location compared to others. The food is usually the same across the board, nothing fancy nor amazing but good eats. I've always found the food overpriced but I do love the decor of these places."
Samantha B.,"Modesto, CA",30,9,2,1.0,7/4/2016,"I have so many complaints, I don't know if I can get enough character to input the info. First....the wait is long...dirty floor and seat....waitress was not friendly....served cold water in a hot dirty glass....the bread was just as cold as the butter... annoyed by this natz flying around the table...but the food was good and I will probably eat at another Cheesecake restaurant"
Raymond L.,Hong Kong,34,172,1251,4.0,12/26/2014,"I like the diversity of the menu as it can entertain groups of people that have finicky eaters. Service is good majority of the times that i have visited, but you may get a sub par one every now and then. The small bite dishes are great for sharing and can be a meal in itself when you order several of them. One of my favorite dish on the menu is the chicken bellagio. Bring your appetite as the entree portions size can run a bit large. Finish off your meal with a must have cheese cake, with so many choices to choose from, there is gotta be one that you'll like."
Leonard W.,"San Jose, CA",0,10,1,3.0,4/14/2017,"Went here on a Friday night with my family.  It was pretty packed had a 40min wait to be seated.  Our waiter was friendly and attentive.  They brought my sons food out quickly which was good because he was starving.  Our food took a while to come out,  but the quality and taste was great."
Kristian S.,"Dublin, CA",0,12,,1.0,1/21/2016,Worst. Experience. Ever! I unfortunately got a $200 gift card to this crappy place. I don't even know where to begin. Expect to wait insane amount of time to be seated and expect even longer time on curbside orders. Damn you be lucky if they even answer your call. Oh and remember to check your order before you leave. Notorious to always mess up your order or forget something. Stay away from this place!!!   Anyone who wants to buy my gift card? Balance is $120. I hate this place so much that I even pay you $20 to take this gift card from
Hemal K.,"San Ramon, CA",39,25,38,1.0,12/15/2015,I hope these ppl know that their ratings are not that great on Yelpa anyways.  Regardless of that they continue to suck at their service.  I would not come back to a place where the food plate is thrown at your face. They don't deserve to be In this industry. Food is good but it's just not the food that ppl go to restaurants. Waiter was Julio J.
Linda H.,"Dublin, CA",0,3,14,5.0,7/29/2016,"Used Door Dash Delivery for our dinner tonight! Ordered the Gumbo with brown rice, and Fettuccine Alfredo with Chicken! Both were outstanding!! The food was hot and fresh!! I'm just sorry I didn't snap a pic!!"
Bridget W.,"Nampa, ID",0,12,11,1.0,1/23/2017,"Every experience I have had with this chain has been phenomenal. I came to this location and was absolutely appalled. The three of us ordered pizza, five minutes later the server came back to inform us they ran out of pizza. I ordered a cheesesteak, five minutes later the server came out to inform me they didn't have the bread for the cheesesteak. I ended up not ordering anything. We got an order of nachos and cheesecake to go when we ordered our food. Our server brought out the cheesecake almost right after we placed our order, even though we ordered it to go. They brought our to go nachos out with our food, even though it was for someone back at home. Now, we are going to be bringing home soggy nachos and warm cheesecake. When I went to the bathrooms, one of the toilets overflowed as there was stagnant water on the ground. The toilet paper in one of the stalls was simply placed on the back where the handle to flush it was. There were toilet seat covers littered on the ground. This location needs new management! Don't waste your time coming here."
Edward T.,"Alameda, CA",1,21,5,1.0,7/23/2016,Absolute worst cheesecake factory I have ever been to. The service is slow and the food is way below the normal factory standards. Never again
Lily Y.,"Pleasanton, CA",0,3,,1.0,3/21/2017,"Their to-go service was bad,  -5 star !!! I tried to call in to order but they never picked up my calls so I went in to order.  They had only had one person working the register and answer phone calls.  I stood in line for 15 minutes before it was my turn to place my order because they screwed up on someone's order and it took 10 minutes with just the one customer to get it squared away.  After ordering, they told me my order would take about 30 minutes.   After waiting more than 30 minutes, I had to get back in line to ask about my order.  I was told they're finishing up with my order and will be ready in a few minutes.  Waited another 10 minutes, I asked again and was told that the brown rice was bad and so they had to cook a fresh batch  (ordered brown rice with one of my entree) and would be ready in 3 minutes.  Another 10 minutes, I'm still waiting, I complained they should have told me 20 minutes ago about the brown rice and I could have switched to regular white rice.  Of course she apologized and said the order was ready and they're bringing it out. That took another 10 minutes. If I had not paid, I would have left and forget about it.  Finally, after one hour, they brought my order out.   What really pisted me off was when I got home, I saw that they gave me white rice instead!!!  Everything else also tasted bad and old because it was under their heating lamp for half hour while waiting for the brown rice to cook."
Boo S.,"Hayward, CA",0,5,,1.0,10/23/2016,Terrible experience at this restaurant. We were told there was about a 20 minute wait to be seated but were seated in about 10 minutes. But once we finally sat down we ended up waiting 1 hour and a half for our food. Which ended up making this a more then 2 hour trip. When our food arrived it was cold and nasty. Waitress never apologized for the wait. Nor we offered anything to compensate for this very bad experience. Will never be returning to the Cheesecake Factory.
Jessica N.,"Dublin, CA",0,16,,4.0,4/22/2016,"Service - Especially for a chain restaurant as busy as this place, the service is GREAT every time. A little distracted maybe but i don't actually mind, this is probably the only place i wouldn't mind if i have to flag down a waiter/waitress. This place is ridiculously busy almost any given time of the day. So yea im more than sympathetic to that. But still the service is great.  I just wish they took reservation. That would be awesome.  Food - very inexpensive and huge huge portion. (Tastes goood too) Im literally not exaggerating when i say that you could share a plate w a person. I have never finished a dish there before! Ever! One thing----please serve warm butter w the bread because its a little weird that the butter is cold."
Joyce Z.,"San Leandro, CA",341,798,5072,4.0,5/15/2013,"I've been here many times for their cheesecake slices that we always get to go so it was nice to finally get a chance to eat here without the lines since we showed up after 4.  Even though lunch specials were until 5, we opted to do a bunch of small plates/apps instead since they looked so good.   1.  Fried mac and cheese - these are golf ball sized mac and cheese that are breaded and then deep fried and served with a creamy marinara sauce.  I was pleasantly surprised that the mac and cheese inside were nice and warm but on the flipside was disappointed that the marinara sauce was cold making it almost gummy.  So I ended up eating it without the dipping sauce.  There are 4 per order so perfect for sharing but is quite rich and filling if you eat it on your own.  2.  Vietnamese tacos - It is their version of the Chairman Bao's steamed asian buns - since they use roasted pork, it is of course not as juicy as the Chairman's but still nicely marinated and tasty.   3.  Portabella Mushrooms, Avocado and Zucchini Fries -  Although you can feel better about eating your veggies, this is breaded and fried so you may want to calm down on the aioli dipping sauces it comes with.  I ended up after the first one, using ketchup instead.   4.  Roadside Sliders - Served with Grilled Onions and ketchup with the sliders but they kept the pickles and lettuce on the side to prevent it from getting too soggy which is great if you were like us who over ordered and had to doggy bag it.   I also tried the Frozen Iced Mango which was refreshing and light as unlike the smoothies, it's mainly fruit, juice, and a hint of coconut blended with ice, like a slushy!!   Of course, after all the food, there was no room for cheesecake this time around, but I intend to stop by again for it soon!!"
Michael J.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,25,15,3.0,10/31/2016,reson why lot of peple go here.... i think just because  the name is so famous. so many times asking ready to order. i didnt even spend 10 min after seat. feels like hurry up just eat and go. but why did they let me wait 40 min to seat on table. reson why lot of peple go here.... i think just because  the name is so famous. reson why lot of peple go here.... i think just because  the name is so famous.
LeAza D.,"Hayward, CA",111,267,866,4.0,11/12/2015,"My mom's favorite place to eat. Love coming here, especially with family. The food never lets me down. Haven't been disappointed yet."
Rachel N.,"San Lorenzo, CA",360,228,188,4.0,8/26/2015,"It's impossible for this place to have a slow day. Day or night, the second they open or the minute they close, they are always packed, good luck getting a seat! Good advice would be to attend only with small parties, probably 6 max. This way you'll be able to get a seat quicker instead of standing out in the sun hating your life. Veryyy extensive menu, most of which is fabulous and the cheesecake of course is even more fabulousss. Their jambalaya is to die for and kobe burger is delicious. Service is off and on depending on just how busy they are/how much staff they have on hand. Very friendly for birthdays!"
Deepika N.,"Union City, CA",0,10,1,4.0,4/17/2017,Huge portions!! You wont leave without a to go bag.Long lines on the weekends but worth the wait.Love their calamari and free bread.
Connie B.,"San Ramon, CA",31,7,,1.0,3/28/2017,"Cheesecake Factory has always been one of my favorite places. In fact, when I lived in Chicago I used to eat there all the time with my best friend, so the place holds special meaning for me. Today, my mom retired so I wanted to take her to one of my favorite places. Unfortunately, our waiter Derrick must have been having a bad day. He not only did not smile once or even greet us, he hardly spoke a single word to us. He severely neglected us. I was so sad and disappointed that my mother's special dinner was ruined. To top everything off, her steak was bloody (gross) even though she ordered medium well. Our waiter never discovered this mistake since he never ONCE checked on us--he didn't even bring us our meal. And even worse, my 5 year old went stir crazy because we waited so long for every single thing. There was a waitress nearby (I wish I got her name) who kindly tried to help us a couple of times. Because of my history here (20 years eating here between Chicago and Pleasanton locations), I feel like I lost a small piece of my heart today. So incredibly disappointing."
