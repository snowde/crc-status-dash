Lashon J.,"Fairfield, CA",0,25,20,3.0,12/19/2017,I love the Cheesecake Factory my fiancé and I went to this place and I got my regular Jamaican black pepper shrimp and chicken with brown rice and plantains with cucumber lemonade the best umm!
Michelle M.,"San Diego, CA",0,44,10,1.0,1/4/2018,"Wow cannot begin to describe this visit. We received an ""e-gift"" of two cheesecake slices. First attempt to redeem was 12/30 and was told not available until 1/1. Not listed anywhere on email (two working professionals who commute to SF and San Mateo with new baby) fine. Just tried to redeem this again and error with ""e-gift "" after waiting 15 minutes calmly ask to speak to manager who honors e-gift and tells employee to get two slices for me. Employee has been rude from beginning. While another staff member is getting my slices she now informs me that error is my fault, I should know start date of e-gift, and starts arguing with me. She continues to escalate her behavior. I tell her calmly that her behavior is unacceptable and she responds that she does not have time for me and she is going to have a manager ""escort me out."" I ask for manager- he is going to speak to her- and directed me to customer service. I have already spoke to customer service and have never experienced anything like this- really disappointing Cheesecake Factory- I hope this staff member receives training in how to treat customers as many people would love to have her job, My family and friends will never dine in a Cheesecake Factory again. Hopefully this review prompts positive changes in CF- consumers work hard for our money and should never be exposed to this unacceptable behavior."
Sherly S.,"Modesto, CA",0,43,17,5.0,8/26/2017,"Been here few times and never been disappointed! Stopped here on a Saturday around 1:40pm and was told it was a 20 minute wait, but were seated after 10 minutes. The server was very professional and provided a great service.  I ordered the mushroom burger and it was delicious! My mom got their lunch size pizza and salad and even though it was lunch size, the portion was large. We got the white chocolate caramel macadamia nut cheesecake and it was amazing!  Overall I definitely recommend this place. Great service, clean, and amazing food. They also have outdoor seating, which is great for when the weather is good."
Grace L.,"Dublin, CA",142,382,654,4.0,1/8/2017,"This place is always busy no matter what time of the day.  Today we didnt have to wait too long......20 minutes is nothing compare to other times we came here. It was that time if the year where everyone redeems their gift cards with cheesecake freebies.   I'm fortunate to have loving family and friends who have the passion for eating. The lady who helped us with our order is Michelle.  She welcome us with a smile and is very attentive to our needs.   Eventhough our meal took longer than expected, Our service made up for it."
Joshua T.,"Dublin, CA",104,191,246,4.0,6/5/2017,"The service here has always been good.  Super busy here..all the time, however.   Now believe when I say this: The best entree here, is the Kobe burger.  Don't knock it till ya try.   It truly is that good. I spend all my time letting people get a bite and then they become believers.  I know the menu is huge..lots to pick.  Juicy, tasty, a big dish...don't even need to add anything to it...truly a gem."
Jackie C.,"East Bay, CA",5,77,6,1.0,9/5/2017,"So I'm just here to update.  I never did hear back from The Cheesecake Factory after contacting them through the website even though I provided multiple ways to reach back out to me. What is the point of asking your patrons to write in to ""discuss what happened"", if that route is a dead end?  Just feels like you are trying to cover your behind in the public's eyes.   This shows how much they care about patrons, at least on a management and above, level."
Kumar J.,"Fremont, CA",7,16,69,3.0,10/29/2017,Long wait. Food is expensive.Tabel Service is good. We wait nearly 1 hours tonget served. It too much crowded.
Theodore M.,"Chicago, IL",51,34,53,5.0,9/28/2017,"I don't understand how any Cheesecake Factory gets less than 4 stars.  If you're whining about the wait, go to a fast food dump.  Every dish here is beyond awesome.  Unless you're lactose intolerant, cheesecake is one of the most awesome foods of the gods...and goddesses!  And I just walked in a got a fantastic booth!  Ha!"
Julia L.,"East Bay, CA",550,287,591,3.0,10/3/2016,"Typical Cheesecake Factory; crowded, long waits, and mediocre food. The boyfriend and I decided to eat here last minute before heading into the mall, because we were both super hungry. Not the greatest plan, but the individual at the front said the wait would only be 20-25 minutes. Although it took us 30 minutes to get seated, which isn't bad for an extremely busy Saturday afternoon, it took another 30 minutes or so to be served our meal. We were basically at Cheesecake for a good hour and a half, but we only spent about 20 minutes of that time eating. Take away message; if you don't have a busy day or any major plans AND don't mind waiting AND you are craving Cheesecake food that badly, then Cheesecake is the way to go. PS: There's also lines at the restroom, yay! Food was okay, it's your typical Cheesecake food. My boyfriend and I ordered from the lunch menu, which I think you get the most bang for your buck. He got the Orange Chicken and I got the Luau Salad, both of which are generous in portion size. For dessert, we shared the Dulce de Leche Cheesecake. It was good, but after a few bites I was done. It was way too sweet. Overall, the food is fine. Service was better. Our server, Gigi was attentive, really chill, and she hooked us up with the bread (we were so hungry). My experience here wasn't horrible, but it wasn't amazing either. Very time consuming, but I think that applies to most if not all Cheesecake Factory locations, especially during the weekends. I hate to admit it, but Cheesecake will forever have a place in my heart. Although it's not the best restaurant ever, it does bring back some nostalgic memories from high school days. Plus, who doesn't like cheesecake?"
Jezelle S.,"Hayward, CA",142,146,313,5.0,4/8/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory never fails to provide me with the highest level of customer service. This place is always poppin and now I know why. Customer service is ridiculously great and the food is even better.  I've been here on many different occasions, but the photos you'll see from me are when I treated my boyfriend out when he landed a permanent position at his job that he started off as seasonal. We came here around 10pm! Late dinner, I know. It was really on impulse.  It was an amazing dinner with my love. My server was amazing. She was so sweet and funny. Extremely patient with me because I really didn't know what I wanted. I wanted something unhealthy, but then I knew I was on a diet. Babe was like, ""Cheat day?"" Ugh. Haha.  He got pasta and I got a salad. I forgot how large the portions were. You truly do get your money's worth here. Man! Can't forget about the bread. I can't believe it's unlimited. I'm pretty much full just eating that. Love this place! Can't wait to eat here again. Which will be soon!!!"
Alysha M.,"San Ramon, CA",1,11,2,1.0,12/15/2017,"if I could give negative stars I would. Came here with a group of my friends and ordered chicken nachos. My nachos came without chicken so I asked the waiter for some and she said she was going to bring some for me to put on. No problem. What I did have a problem with is she came back and said there was no marinade on the chicken. So I said I didn't want that and I'd like something different. She came back and said they can prepare some and that it would come very soon. So I waited. 20 minutes or so later my nachos never came. The worst part is the manager comes to the table and tells me that it's not a big deal and that it's coming. Well 15-20 min later still don't get it and eventually it comes out wrong again so I said forget it and the manager asks ""are you going to pay for it or not?"" Yeah not coming back."
George F.,"San Ramon, CA",3627,1078,6006,4.0,9/19/2016,Out of all the chain restaurants Cheesecake Factory has always been a favorite of mine ever since they were a one location restaurant in Los Angeles. The Pleasanton location on the backside of the Stoneridge Mall is always busy. Its been a while since I have been back because of the long wait times and inexperienced hosts. This time my partner and I came early but still were told to wait for about 8 minutes even though there were plenty of empty tables. The menu is huge literally a book and always has some thing I feel like having. This time I ordered the meatloaf and it was very good. It came in three thick slices with mash potatoes and a corn succatash.  Plenty of parking in the mall parking lot. Service is hit or miss with the initial interaction with the hostess podium. The food is good and portions are huge.
Jacquelyn H.,"Livermore, CA",2,9,,1.0,11/5/2017,"Worst expericence ever!!  My family and I came to this location to celebrate 3 birthdays tonight. At 5:15pm we checked in and got our little buzzer thing and we were told it would be a 1 hour wait.  Cool totally fine I get its busy. An hour goes by and the buzzer thing doesnt go off...fine.  An hour and fifteen minutes into the wait we go check in to see how much longer and we are told there are 3 tables ahead of us...cool...yes annoyed but fine. We watch 6 more parties get seated so we ask again when will we be seated and the MANAGER said our table is being cleaned it will be 5 minutes...ok.  TWO hour wait and we were still waiting and we are all beyond irritated so once again we ask how long...the hostess tells my mother that we left and that they buzzed us 45 minutes ago LIE, said they will give us a new buzzer thing and we will have to wait...ummm no, and the hostess continues to argue with my mom about not being there when they buzzed us ( just freaking rude as crap!).  So the manager comes over and takes us to a table.  No apology at all. This was also the same manager that said they were cleaning our table and would be seated in 5 minutes. Look I get it's busy I totally understand but if its going to be a 2 hour wait just say that so people can choose to leave if they want to. To the manager that offered no apology.....I get your stress as a manger myself I understand but a simple apology goes far with some customers just saying."
Sheila C.,"Dublin, CA",1,3,,3.0,10/7/2017,"Update 10/17/17:  I have to say that Cheesecake was good on their word and conducted themselves well and professionally to address my complaint and ensure that I was a satisfied customer. Hopefully my experience was a one-off and it won't be a regular occurrence. So that definitely reflects on my new rating, really meant to be 3.5 stars but looks like only whole stars are possible. 10/7/17:  No wonder they get low ratings! The whole point for me to call in ahead of time my order is to save my precious time. Instead I ended up waiting double the time if I just went in to order my takeout! And all that time my food was just sitting right there and the cashier kept saying my food wasn't ready! They didn't even bother to comp me for their lousy mistake and wasting my time. I had a feeling that was mine but unless I'm allowed to go behind the counter to do their job, I have to go with what they say. So they give my food that has been sitting there for well over half hour & that's all cold. Just great!"
Darlene T.,"San Francisco, CA",481,85,128,1.0,8/8/2017,"I came here on a Saturday and wow this is the worst Cheesecake Factory I have ever been to. It was not our waiter it was whatever happening in the back. We were seated outside, no wait. There was nothing good about this experience. We waited for a server for about 15 minutes (they said the new server confused the tables). We waited almost an hour for our food to come. They didn't have the ingredients to the Farfalle with Chicken so it was ""sold out."" One of the customers on the right table never got her food. The table on the left had to send back their food. The pastas we got were also not up to par.  It was a pretty bad experience. Definitely won't be coming back here. I feel bad for the servers. They cannot control how fast the food comes out so I give props to them."
Alexis M.,"Danville, CA",401,604,158,2.0,3/2/2017,"Came here for dinner with my daughters on a Thursday night. Waited the 20 minutes, that you always seem to wait to eat at The Cheesecake Factory.  We sit down, and has a nice waitress. One daughter orders the fried shrimp platter, one The spaghetti and meatballs and I order a salad.  She comes back and says they are out of the fried shrimp platter. Well that's a bummer, but fine. She reorders.  Then she comes back and says they are out of all salads!! Salads!? All salads! How are you out of salad? Half your menu is salad! So annoying. Waitress was nice, but it was just weird and really, kind of sucked after waiting 20 min to not get what you want to eat. If I wanted to eat food I really didn't want, I would have eaten at home. Once we did order food, it took forever to come. I mean to the point where the manager even came by on his own to apologize.  And to make it worse two really drunk dudes sat down next to us reeking if booze and cigarettes. Which made enjoy the food we didn't want suck even more.  All in all, not a great experience."
Alfie F.,"Pleasanton, CA",12,95,473,4.0,9/23/2017,I  these guys happy hour. So I am just reviewing the Happy hour experience in the bar area The menu is only available from 4 to 6 (I wish they would extend till 7pm) I can only make it on Wednesday due to the tight time frame.i tried most of the drinks on the HH menu-don't waste your funds on the margarita (mostly ice) out of the all the drinks I tried the cosmo had the most alcohol-the mojito was just okay But the big hit was the avocado egg rolls I totally recommend those little puppies. If you want to fill up you may want to select the buffalo blasts (I could not finish them) Oh and a shout out to Kevin my server he was awesome
Leah B.,"Union City, CA",1,3,,1.0,11/11/2017,"I would give this place a 0 if I could. Sergio the manager was nothing but rude. Arrived with a party of 15 they gave us a 2 hour wait and we checked in on the wait 3 times. The third time of checking in they told us it would be an hour wait. 30 mins later they gave away our table on the 2 hour mark. Sergio told me they paged us...we were given no pager! He offered to wait another hour and a half or seat us outside on a cold November night as if that would make up for it, wouldn't work for me with a group of senior citizens. Take your business elsewhere!!!"
Simran K.,"Union City, CA",296,119,932,2.0,8/6/2016,"I love Cheesecake Factory, but this location was a big disappointment.  The food was bland, the servers were rude and no bread for our table :/ We ordered chicken Marsala which had no flavour, the pasta was dried and undercooked.  Also, ordered sausage shrimp pasta which was very very spicy but no salt !!!  We even had to ask to spoon and fork   Won't be going to this location again !!"
Jennifer C.,"Alameda, CA",70,13,,3.0,12/31/2017,"Came for New Year's Eve dinner- got lucky and got bar seating quickly.  Appetizers came quickly- very good!  My meal came, but shortly after we heard a loud crash in the restaurant and we all thought ""Party foul"". Waiter came by with manager and told us it was our other two meals that were dropped and would get replacements out ASAP.  Offered salads while we waited- but had appetizers already and didn't want any.  I finished eating by the time the other meals came out.  The food was very good.  We ordered a piece of cheesecake to go.  We got the bill, and assumed they would at least comp an appetizer or the piece of cheesecake - do SOMETHING due to the party foul on the meals not coming together.  Our bill was not discounted at all.  I am not one to cause a scene and ask for a discount.  Accidents happen.  Just assumed they would have good customer service and at least offer one item comped, but nothing.  Happy New Year!!"
