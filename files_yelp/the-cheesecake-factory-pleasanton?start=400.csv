Celena Z.,"Union City, CA",6,24,35,5.0,7/31/2016,"This review is dedicated to the new server who started today, her name is Samone (I hope that's the correct spelling). Samone is a great server and she served us very well for her first day on the job. She checked up on us frequently and did everything we asked her to. My friend and I came at a fairly busy time so I knew it was hard for her to juggle several tables at once. With this said she did a fantastic job!"
Mai C.,"San Francisco, CA",12,67,2,4.0,10/24/2015,"I only come here for the bread, drinks, and appetizers. Oh and the cheesecake. Who can forget the friggin cheesecake.  Service could be better. There's always a long wait. ALWAYS. You cannot avoid it unless you come right when it opens or when it's slow - which almost never happens because everybody wants some damn cheesecake."
Gigi S.,"Woburn, MA",0,6,,2.0,10/12/2016,"Unless you go very early for dinner, say 4:00pm, it's usually very crowded. It's not uncommon to have to wait 50min or more.  I just waited 20 minutes on hold to order take out, nobody picked up the phone. I called first, got transferred to take out, waited 10 min. Called again, same story.  Check out the calorie count of the menu items. Scary! I must add that the people (except those taking take out orders) are nice, polite and do their best to provide good service."
Miguel W.,"Hayward, CA",4,20,29,1.0,9/6/2016,"Been here many times. Food always good but the wait time always long. Always willing to be seated outside and they always have tables open outside but always under staffed. I asked why there is 8 tables open and and 1/2 hour wait? There reply ""not enough staff and someone called in sick"". Sad because they have great place and great food but never enough staff.  I think my review above says it all. Cheesecake Factory sent me a reply via Yelp and ask why. Did my review miss anything?"
Kelly G.,"Aurora, CO",119,389,7889,3.0,1/20/2015,"This was my first visit to this location.  They were located near California Pizza Kitchen at Stoneridge Mal in Pleasanton.  The only entrance was from the outside of the mall. I ordered from the lunch menu.  I ordered the Pizza and Salad combo.  The pizza and salad came out at the same time.  It would have been nice to eat the salad while waiting for my hot pizza.  The Caesar Salad was a dollar or two extra.  It was coated in dressing.  I would have asked for another one if I had seen my server.  The Calabrian Pizza was very salty and the crust was charred to a crisp.  The pizza was not piping hot.  It felt like it sat under the warmer.  Again, I would have asked for another pizza not baked so long if I had seen my server. I had a coupon for a free cheesecake.  I ordered the Tiramisu Cheesecake to go.  It came in a plastic box with room for whipped cream.  No complaint there."
Tiffany C.,"Fremont, CA",14,44,39,3.0,7/27/2016,"Pricey American food. Slice of cheesecake is about $7 or higher. When I went, the service was great. Dimly lit inside. Located at a corner next to Macys of Valley Fair."
Marrion M.,"Union City, CA",170,20,15,4.0,7/31/2016,"My friend and I love pasta da Vinci and we literally drove 30 minutes just to come here from the east bay. the wait was long, as it usually is but our food arrived at a decent time. Our waitress was Simone, and although it was a really busy Sunday, she tried to accommodate us as best as she could from giving us the warmest table and checking on our food. The service made our experience probably 10x better. Thanks Simone!"
Maissa N.,"Fremont, CA",0,6,,1.0,3/18/2017,Don't waste your time. Food quality has been going down.. usually I love the food there. Did a take out.. I have had this same dish so many times but usually I eat it there.. the take out was nothing compared to the usual meal.. tasted nasty and dry.. don't do take out there.. have the feeling they are more thorough if you eat there coz if the food is no good you will return it.. if you do take out they just don't care.. spent over 150 and food was no good. What a waste
Stuart B.,"Oakland, CA",69,56,121,2.0,3/23/2015,"Dinner was scrumptious. Ordered the Chicken Madeira (see photo). Restaurant has nice ambience indoors and outdoors. Large and spacious.  We chose to sit outdoors near the fire/fountain. The hostess cost them a better review. On two occasions she told us there was no wait time to be seated. But, we wound up waiting 10 minutes anyways. I ended up speaking to the Manager to expedite our seating. Poor thing...treat people right! Lastly, we were seated at a table with no setup i.e. silverware, plates, etc. Moreover, we waited longer than normal to be greeted by our waiter. Fortunately, our waiter was cool. Friendly, patient, and intuitive!"
Samy L.,"San Jose, CA",150,173,2,2.0,1/19/2016,"Went here for my boyfriend's mom's birthday on a Sunday night around 6PM. Server was pretty attentive. However, I feel like this location's food was pretty bland. I like the Oakridge location better. I ordered the same dish my boyfriend had got from Oakridge location but it was definitely not as good.. we asked for cheese and red pepper flakes to hopefully boost it."
Christina L.,"Winston-Salem, NC",293,518,1894,5.0,12/27/2013,"No surprise to find me at a desserts place celebrating my birthday, right? I ordered the Chicken Bellagio - crispy coated chicken breast over basil pasta and parmesan cream sauce, topped with prosciutto and arugula salad. The chicken (2 patties) was impressively tender and delicious. The crust was perfectly light and thin, just enough to add a little crunch to the chicken. I would have liked to have more of the prosciutto, rather than a couple thin slices. Hot chocolate looked amazing when it arrived at my table, but of course, I still need a REAL dessert. Now that it's in season again, I just HAD to order the Peppermint Bark Cheesecake - white chocolate cheesecake swirled with chunks of chocolate peppermint bark, topped with white chocolate mousse, finished with chopped peppermint (available for the fall/winter holidays). Refreshing and beautiful, this cheesecake was presented on a plate that said ""Happy Birthday to You"" (in chocolate syrup). Looks and tastes incredible, even though I don't usually like/eat peppermint. Definitely glad I tried it! It was so crowded (due to everyone being on winter break for the holidays) that my group decided to sit outside (shorter wait period). However, at one point, the sunny sky suddenly turned overcast and it began sprinkling! Great. The waiters put up umbrellas, but not enough to ensure everyone was covered. Luckily, I was! Also, the waiters huddled around me to sing happy birthday, after announcing it was my 21st birthday, which it definitely was NOT (though I'm sure they all thought I was still in high school - for all you Asians out there, I'm sure you understand). Awesome birthday celebration. Cheers to yet another year of being ""21!"""
Lena S.,"San Leandro, CA",9,16,1,4.0,9/14/2016,"Love this place and food, me and my husband are keep on coming here every time when we are close by. Food is really good, also there is a great choice  of vegetarian dishes what is very important for me, because I don't eat meat. One problem what this place is always busy , and you can't make a reservation, so usually we have to wait for about an hour."
Michelle C.,"Palo Alto, CA",1622,583,3169,4.0,12/21/2013,"Friday 5pm.  20 min wait for a party of 5. Service was quick. The waiter was excellent. Drinks: Chardonnay and a strawberry daiquiri Kids lemonades in kid cups. All were good. Appetizer: Hot crab dip: cream cheese with crab shreds and artichoke with some tomato flavor. The crispy buttery bread served with it was great. I wouldn't order it again though. Good but not that good. Food: Kids mac and cheese-elbow macaroni in a kraft-type cheese sauce. Very basic. The pasta was al dente and the kids didn't eat much. Kids pizza- I did not like the cheese. The crust was thin with nice edges. Chicken romanesco- 3 pieces of flat chicken covered with Parmesan and panko, fried to a golden crisp topped w a light lemon cream sauce. Served with yummy mashed potatoes and asparagus.($18) Shrimp with angel hair pasta- lots of tomatoes. That's what the server advised and it was true. The pasta was overdone and it only had 5 pieces of shrimp. The tomatoes were bland. I had to add salt. I wish they offered me Parmesan. Not worth it. ($18) Dessert: Lemoncello torte to go: this dessert is so good. It looks like tiramisu, has a crunchy topping like an apple crisp, creamy, lemony, with a side of strawberries. It was so good I ate it ALL!!!! $8 The food is alright here,but expensive. The desserts can accommodate most people. I love the ambiance of the place. The server made it a pleasant experience."
Carol S.,"Hayward, CA",4,13,,1.0,9/10/2016,"My daughter asked us to take her the Cheesecake Factory for her birthday dinner. What a disappointment. We got there late and waited over an hour for a table. We expected that so were happy to wait. Got seated outside. Not the best but ok. Got water and ordered drinks and an appetizer. Server brought bread but we had no silverware to butter the bread with.  10 minutes later, appetizer came out but still had no silverware to eat it with. We ordered dinner and asked for silverware. Server came back with my husband's beer about five minutes later and we said ""don't we get plates for the appetizer?""  Plates came and finally got silverware but the hot appetizer is now lukewarm.  After 30 minutes, server brought my husband his dinner. Birthday girl and I had to wait. 15 minutes later, she got her dinner but my dinner wasn't ready yet. 10 minutes later, here comes my dinner - and it was incorrect. I ordered grilled and they brought fried fish tacos.  At this point, we had sat on the patio for over an hour.  I sent my dinner back and just wanted the check as I was no longer hungry.  We wanted to have a nice celebration dinner TOGETHER, not get served our meals separately. This was not the server's fault as she has no control over the food but seriously, $70 tab for mediocre food at a restaurant with a poorly run kitchen is horrible. We will not be returning to this location ever."
Sierra G.,"Manteca, CA",156,2,4,1.0,4/9/2017,"If I could give 0 stars...I WOULD. Waited 2 hours for a table for a party of 6 after being told it would be about 1 hour. Our server was not helpful or attentive, service was super slow, they didn't have the drinks we wanted or the food we ordered, but didn't tell us that until 10 minutes AFTER we ordered. The food was not prepared correctly, so one person in our party couldn't even eat theirs and the manger didn't offer to make it right, we had to ask to have it taken off the bill. The credit card reader was down when we were FINALLY trying to leave, the waitress kept badgering us for cash to pay the bill, even though we repeatedly told her we didn't have it. Eventually after about 20 minutes of back and forth, they took an imprint of someone's credit card to charge later, which still hasn't been run, a full 24 hours later. Needless to say, we did not leave a tip and will be contacting the company further. Bad service, bad food, bad management. Disappointing since it was my birthday."
Maila P.,"San Francisco, CA",60,85,284,2.0,10/30/2015,"This is why I will ALWAYS go to the one in San Francisco..  Armando...if I can give you 5 stars I would but I can't. You were so nice and attentive to us before your shift was over and we appreciate you! It was my girlfriend and I who ate here last night. Started off with a few drinks and then ordered 3 appetizers: Calamari, Spring Rolls, and the Crab Dip. Entree: Chicken and Biscuits....... or so we thought. First, the Spring Rolls are dry and lacking shrimp. The Calamari was super greasy and the coating batter was so soggy!! I asked for different sauce than the peanut sauce for the Spring Rolls which took 15 minutes to bring out and tasted so gross (green sauce). Crab Dip was good but served with seriously 5 pieces of toasted bread.  I ordered another drink while waiting for our entree which took another 15 minutes to bring out. Didn't know it takes that long to make a drink. When the Chicken and Biscuits came out, my friend and I searched for the biscuits, NONE. Some other female server asked how everything came out. When we told her about the biscuits, she asked if we want it on the side or to take the whole plate back. Taking the plate back, the chef literally threw on some burnt biscuits on top SAME PLATE!!!!  SERVICE HERE is so terrible and the price you pay, the food is not all that great. When we are in the city, the food comes out promptly, the food comes out complete, and FRESHLY made not some dry spring rolls and soggy calamari."
Kim P.,"San Lorenzo, CA",1,3,,1.0,3/27/2017,Went in it wasn't busy at all half the tables were empty . Ordered our food and sat for like an hour and nothing. Plenty of workers working and empty tables like I said don't know why it took so but I had to leave before we could get our food . Mind you we only decided to go since it wasn't busy in there and our time was a bit limited so we thought it would be a good time to go . Well I was wrong and very disappointed
Diyan D.,"Manteca, CA",0,1,,1.0,3/27/2017,"Horrible service. After being seated it was a good 20 minutes until we got drinks, food took another 1/2 hour. Ordered a piece of cheesecake on the way out in the lobby area and had to wait 10 minutes for that. Lunch took almost 2 hours total."
Paul S.,"Castro Valley, CA",0,16,20,1.0,3/7/2017,"Took our daughter for a birthday dinner. If it weren't for our server they would have received 0 stars. Food was decent, great steaks. The wait was said to be 25 minutes on a Tuesday evening. 35 minutes in they take us to be seated but someone is sitting at our table. 10 minutes later we are seated. Table was extremely wobbly and no light to read the menu. Took 10 minutes to take our drink order and they are out of lemonade (all lemonade) another 10 minutes to have our food order taken, 35 minutes to get our food, Brought me the wrong drink and did not offer to exchange. $150 later for 3 people. Everyone around us was on their phone using their flashlights to see the menu and kids everywhere banging on plates. Worst experience ever. Will never go back. Uncertain why this place is so popular."
Tania J.,"American Canyon, CA",1,16,9,1.0,9/25/2016,"I wouldn't recommend this Cheesecake Factory to anyone. I was told when I arrived that the wait time would be texted to me and it wasn't... after that he told me to come back 15-20 minutes later when I returned I was still told to wait.... usually when time is an estimate people usually say it should ""be about ___ minutes"" you should never guarantee a time that you cannot actually attend to... customer service was horrible. The hosts are rude and act like they don't know how to do anything! Smile, be calm and make the customer happy. This is the worst experience I've ever had at a Cheesecake Factory. If I could give 0 stars I would!!!!"
