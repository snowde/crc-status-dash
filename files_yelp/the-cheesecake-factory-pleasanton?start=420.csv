Mariah L.,"San Francisco, CA",181,82,104,3.0,1/7/2016,"Good place to eat after shopping and don't really want to to drive anywhere else.  Every time I come here there's always at least a 15 minutes wait, but service is always super friendly and nice. The atmosphere is alright, i'm not really into the dark AND loud setting. The main reasons why I come back here is because of their amazing honey rye bread that is basically endless and the sweet potato fries. Anything else is sub par, small portion, and over priced. Another thing that makes it not as good is that the bread is sometimes cold are barely warmed, which makes it hard for the butter to melt in. I would only come back for more bread and sweet potato fries or if I really was too lazy to go anywhere else."
Rin M.,"San Lorenzo, CA",286,8,23,1.0,11/12/2015,"So I was sat in the bar area and I tend to always get neglected in this area. No server, no water, no utensils and no bread for the first 20 minutes that I was sitting down. When we were approached, the waiter smelled like cigarettes and he was rude. He was rude during our whole dinner!  I ordered the grilled salmon that comes with broccoli and mashed potatoes. When my food finally came out, I noticed that I didn't receive the mashed potatoes. So I had to ask another employee there to get it for me, and when it finally arrived, it was cold. My original, rude server came back to refill our waters; there was three of us and he refilled all the cups except mine. His name is Daniel. Daniel with an A."
Shonda N.,"Hayward, CA",0,2,,1.0,9/21/2016,"Three words. Terrible, Terrible and Terrible. We waited for a table for 30 minutes then we were seated and waited another 15 -20 minutes to even be served. I always order the chicken Madeira my absolute favorite dish. Well the sauce is key to this dish. The sauce was not right at all, it was thin  and lacked the flavor that this dish usually has. The best way to describe the sauce would be that it was not reduced properly.  The next issue was that my daughter order which was a simple fettuccine and Alfredo it came with bow tie pasta, we specifically ordered fettuccine pasta, after waiting another 40minutes for our food originally her plate came out with bow tie pasta. We had to send it back and my daughter by this time is getting tired and hungry. We now are waiting another 30minutes. Her pasta comes out this time with what looks like a whole bottle of Alfredo sauce without any flavor what so ever. My daughter who is 7  says ""this isn't good mommy "".  I asked to speak with the manager and waited another 20minutes before she came out to say that she would remove the pasta from our bill. I am very dis satisfied with the taste of the food and  service that I received. I can't say that I will ever come to this location again. The cooks here should receive training from the cooks at other locations, because the food is much been much  at other cheesecake factories."
jun V.,"Union City, CA",1,5,,1.0,9/21/2016,"came 5pm for 12 people They told us it should take about 1.5 hrs  We got seated at 7:10   Manager told us that we will get free appetizers for fhe long wait Then to find out most of their apetizers were out , What the heck!  Took our order then our server had to come back several times to clarify some of our order .Its 8:05 still eaiting for our food , Ak for extra water NEVER came .

Katherine B.,"San Leandro, CA",57,32,6,1.0,8/2/2016,"Very disappointed. Not only did I ask my server for a high chair THREE times before she brought one for my one year old I had to hold, it was broken and falling apart. The server seemed annoyed with us for some reason but was pleasant with everyone else. I ordered the parmesan crusted chicken and the plate was full of brown oil. It looked disgusting. We never got a refill for our waters, I had to catch her walking away from other tables to order a coffee. I wanted dessert but didn't feel like waiting another 20 minutes for her to come back. It wasn't even busy we got there before the rush of dinner. I will never go back, waste of $50."
Emily C.,"San Lorenzo, CA",0,2,,1.0,3/19/2017,"Took FOREVER to get seated. The host lies to you and says 30 mins but we were waiting for well over an hour. When we were seated we ordered right away when drink orders were being taken. Our food still took 30-40 mins to come! Way too busy, inaccurate waiting time and bad customer service overall. Yea your foods good but its not that good to have to deal with all this when we're gonna finish eating in 15 mins."
Jane K.,"San Jose, CA",40,368,66,4.0,12/24/2015,Yay..Christmas Eve dinner w husband We did not wait too long to get table. Better than other location for customer service and foods Love to eat there and will go back later
Vivian S.,"Fremont, CA",137,2,,1.0,2/9/2017,"This was probably the worse experience i ever had at any restaurant.I ordered apple cider and they gave me apple juice. I tried to flag down a waiter and one even looked at me straight in the eyes then walked away. When I finally stopped a waiter, they told me their apple ciders are just apple juice... Then why does it say cider! So i ask if i can change my drink cus it wasnt what I asked for. And they charged me for it! When my food finally came, it was really good, until i found a fried shrimp tail in it... As if it was a piece of trash that for mixed in. Gross. The waiters were all not helpful and not attentive at all."
Anton E.,"Pleasanton, CA",0,2,,2.0,9/17/2016,"Lax Management. I've come to this Cheesecake Factory 3 times for lunch in the last few months. Each time I show up just after opening time (11:00) to avoid the lunch crowd. Every time, I end up standing in the lobby with 20-30 other people while the staff continues to get the restaurant ready for service. The restaurant is empty, and the tables are all set up. Even showing up at 11:10 made no difference as the desk took my name and told me it would be 5-10 minutes to be seated!   Management is permitting customers to wait rather than requiring their staff to be on site and ready on time. Of course there are some staff ready and working on time, but customers are experiencing frustration (and talking between themselves about it). Hopefully, management will take interest..."
J L.,"Pleasanton, CA",7,26,18,1.0,1/26/2016,"Wow! Just picked up staff luncheon worth $188!! Old lettuce in ALL 3 Cobb salad, burnt Tex mex Rolls, NO Flavor in the Pasta DaVinci AND paid an extra $ 2.00 for a side of Avocado which I DIDN'T GET!!! Now I know why I prefer the Walnut Creek property!!!! C'mon Ptown Cheesecake, show me a reason to come back!!!! #Dissapointed #OntotheNEXT #ThumbsDown pictures to follow......"
GianPierro D.,"Pleasanton, CA",203,62,21,5.0,12/5/2015,"The Cheesecake Factory is a franchise and even though people complain about franchises, there is something quite reassuring in knowing that one will receive the same type of service and products one is accustomed to enjoy. I like the Cheesecake Factory because the baseline of their services is great and then they go above to make sure that all guests experience a good meal in a great setting. I love going to the one located in Pleasanton as the manager Ashley Louie is the nicest and friendliest person that you will ever meet. I believe that all employees aim to be nice and personable. The portions are really quite large so if one is moderately hungry, one can share with a friend or take it home in a doggie bag. It's also a great place to order dessert and with a cheesecake selection that is long and varied, everyone will be pleased! I love the chocolate chocolate chocolate flourless cake!!"
Kathryn L.,"Danville, CA",357,413,1388,4.0,5/15/2013,"It's smart to call ahead to find out what the current wait is then decide if it's doable.  I have tots, so it makes a difference.  We try to go during the week, after the lunch rush but before the dinner rush and we always have a good time.  Husband & I enjoy doing a bunch of small plates: avocado egg rolls, asian lettuce wrap tacos, ahi carpaccio, and ahi & avocado appetizer w/ fried wantons.  Kids usually go with the cheese pizza.  I AM surprised by their pizza; it's wood oven fired and super super thin.  Their cheese is so good, I'm sure their other ones are even better.  Shocking, I know. Service is almost always excellent - fast, attentive, and accommodating.  Of course, the mile long cheesecake list is a must to peruse.  Obviously, we're regulars."
Adam A.,"Hayward, CA",5,14,,1.0,11/25/2016,"I called this location two weeks ago to order a whole cake for my girlfriend birthday. I thought  for sure The Cheesecake Factory wouldn't disappoint me or let me down. WRONG! I called on November 7 around 2:30 pm. The phone was ringing for a long time and I thought...wow; man they must really busy. When someone finally answered I was put on hold. I didn't mind but after 20 minutes of holding I hung up and called back. I thought maybe they forgot there was a call on hold. When I called the second time and when someone answered after another delayed answer I immediately said I want to place an order for a cake. They said ok can you please hold and I said ok. AGAIN The Cheesecake Factory had me on hold again. After 15 mins I hung up again. I said to myself; there's no way they can be this busy on a Monday at 2:30 in the afternoon... just to place an order for a cake...WTF! So I called a third time and someone picked up right away maybe because they knew or remembered someone was holding on he phone. When they answered I said to that person that this is my third time calling and I've been trying to place an order for a while  and it's for a birthday. I could not believe they put me on hold AGAIN and no one answered after 10 mins! I Could not believe this! So I called over to the Walnut Creek location to put in a order for a cake which is 20 mins away from where I live. When I called this location they answered on the first ring, transferred my call to the right person so I could put my order in; they took my order and I gave them specific details for the cake. I informed them that this cake needs to be picked up Friday November 11 @ 4:00pm. I was so upset when a guest of the party told me that the cake was not ready at 4pm and that there was no order placed and no one knew about it. So my guest who I designated to pick up the cake and set up for the surprise party was extremely late and showed up after the celebrant was all because the guest had to wait 45 mins for the SLOPPY birthday greeting on the $57 cake to get prepared. Then fight through traffic to drive to Hayward to get to the party 1hour later. THANKS CHEESESCAKE FACTORY for showing a loyal patron of your restaurant service like this! I'll never attempt or spend my money at your establishment again. I'll more than likely not even accept an Cheesecake Factory gift card as a gift. The quality of the food and service is poor just like Elephant Bar...that's going out of business!"
Kimmie T.,"Fremont, CA",260,9,,1.0,6/3/2016,"This is probably the worst service I've actually ever received. I had a party of 7 We first got into the restaurant and its took us awhile for us to get seated even though we were told only 20 minutes. After finally being seated , We thought things were getting better because we had a wonderful server named Caitlyn was covering for someone else who was on break. Caitlyn was an amazing server,  She was friendly, fast paced, overall on point. She took our drink orders and entrees. After the other server came back from her break, She didn't even introduce herself. (Name was Elizabeth, Caitlyn had told us before hand.) When she came back things went downhill real quick. My uncle ordered a cheesecake and Oreo milkshake. My little cousin had ordered loaded potato tots. Long story short with that, Elizabeth came to the table telling us they were out of the tots so my little cousin had to order something else. She ended up going with the chicken teriyaki. Elizabeth had told us she would out that order in ahead of everyone's since the rest of us got our entrees by this time. We all got ours but my uncles dessert and my little cousins food. 30 minutes later, Elizabeth forgot my uncles dessert. And hour and a half later,  My little cousins food FINALLY got to the table. We had complained to Elizabeth to higher management. We ended up getting a new server. Three servers in one night.  Here's everything that just went wrong: Elizabeth forgot the food, didn't refill our waters until we asked, never cleared the plates off our table (appetizer plates , etc.) , instead of my uncle getting the Oreo milkshake they brought a Oreo cheesecake so wrong order, and when she brought the wrong order she blamed it on Caitlyn, Elizabeth wasn't apologetic at all, she copped out and had someone else tell us that they forgot to put the teriyaki chicken order in. So much went wrong, I'm not even sure if I listed everything. That's how bad the whole experience was.  However Caitlyn again was amazing,  Unfortunately I don't remember the third server but she was amazing as well. Not so sure if I will come back to this location. I am about second chances so we will see. I just wouldn't want that sh*tty server again, EVER."
Nia E.,"Hayward, CA",0,4,2,1.0,3/12/2017,"This place is slow as hell. I am literally sitting at the table while writing this review. So for a party of 2 we were told 35-40min and we ended up waiting an hour and 10min. We have finally been seated and it took another 15min to place an order now we are coming up on another hour and still no food. The waiter finally comes back and says I'll send my manger over. A total of  2hrs and 23 mins later no food or manager, we ask to get the food to go and 5min later we get our food. No apologies, nothing. Worst customer service ever..."
Nardin A.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,5,,5.0,3/12/2017,The service is amazing. The food is fresh and they top it all off with freshly grated cheese!
Alessandro Z.,"Berkeley, CA",5,1,,2.0,5/2/2016,Too busy! They forgot my grilled chicken sandwich. Happy birthday to my friend Sahand though
Maureen H.,"Modesto, CA",1,11,,1.0,9/10/2016,"Went to celebrate my bf's birthday today. For a restaurant who's claim to fame is cheesecake, we were woefully disappointed. But that was after we brought it home. He ordered the sausage and shrimp pasta dish and for almost $20! (Including tax, license and dealer prep) he got exactly 1 1/2 shrimp! He sent it back a d they parted with five more. Our waitress was slow, often unavailable and incapable of doing more than one task at a time. They were not that busy when we arrived. Our entire bill with a gift cheesecake (in one of the few flavors available, and our two desserts was $140! For two people for lunch. Outrageous and today was my final visit. The straw that broke the camel's back was the sickening gummy, stale tasting pieces of cake we brought home. Definitely not fresh, at all. I expect a slice of cheesecake from the Cheesecake Factory to taste as if it was made in a kitchen with fresh ingredients made for human consumption, not the gummy, overly sweetened, stale toxic tasting concoction these people manufacture. A wretched disappointment, crappy service, although friendly enough... But unavailable for a diners needs for an exorbitant price will do it for me. Will never recommend this place again. The ""salted caramel"" cheesecake we brought home for a birthday party was equally unfresh and tasteless, over chemical tasting and we don't care to discuss it with anyone. We just won't be going back. Total and complete disappointment."
Stephanie L.,"Oakland, CA",97,119,10,3.0,11/24/2015,"The Cheesecake Factory is the epitome of basic. Looking at the average reviews of every Cheesecake Factory location in the area will prove this to you. Why people come here looking for an outstanding dining experience is beyond me. Me, I take this chain of mega-restaurants for what it is: mediocre food at premium prices. The Cheesecake Factory was one of the first restaurants to start the menu-as-long-as-a-short-story trend; the menu here is pages upon pages of mixed up cuisines that try too hard which results in, probably, hundreds of dishes done just okay but none of them outstanding.  My mother-in-law brought me here for lunch today before we did some shopping. I had the Cobb Salad and she had some kind of chicken/arugula/pasta dish. We had calamari to start with but I psyched myself out of eating it remembering this NPR story about how some calamari rings are actually pig rectum. We asked our server to hold the bread but he brought it anyway so we ate some. The food was alright. Edible, beyond giant portions. The only reason I would come back is for cheesecake, exclusively. I wondered aloud why I even bothered ordering real food when the cheesecake was CLEARLY the star of the meal. Our waiter was much more concerned with working the booth next to us full of four extremely loud, probably buzzed, mid-30s aged women. He seemed distracted and scattered. Everything about this place is JUST okay: food, service, atmosphere.  My biggest complaint is how LONG we were in there: Took forever to be seated, to have our order taken, to receive food, to have plates cleared, to order dessert, to pay, to get the hell out. I was irritated that this place robbed me of my afternoon, but that's about it."
Hector S.,"Elk Grove, CA",115,26,38,5.0,7/12/2016,"I was at the Cheesecake factory during happy hour, great prices on appetizers and drinks. We also order dinner at it was good. our servers were courteous and helpful."
