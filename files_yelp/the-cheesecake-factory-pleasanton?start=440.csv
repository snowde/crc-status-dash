John F.,"San Leandro, CA",0,10,,5.0,3/10/2017,"This place use to be wonderful but now the silverware is dirty, my water glass was leaking from a crack on the bottom, the food was cold, and the service is dismal.  Get a load of the server with a nose ring!"
David K.,"Tracy, CA",7,30,18,4.0,1/27/2015,It was a long wait and not enough seating for people waiting to eat. The food and service were very good once we were seated.   Crowded ambience.
Paige H.,"Novato, CA",2,2,,1.0,9/27/2015,"I went here last night with my family, ready to celebrate another year of being alive!! We arrived and got our buzzer. After waiting for a while, our buzzer buzzed. You would think they would be ready to seat you but no, the buzzer was for you to stand in another line to be seated. We stood in the second line for 20 min.  After being taken to our table we noticed a table that wasn't even wiped down, crumbs all over the seats and the WORST of all.....every single spoon, knife, and fork had dried up food from the previous users. GROSS! Before the hostess left, we brought the problem to her attention. She brought back dirty silverware 4 times and was very rude. One spoon was completely covered in dried up food. ""These are fresh out of the dishwasher"" ummm I think not lady. Someone eventually brought us clean silverware but it wasn't even worth it.  Our food was completely cold, my pasta dish had clumpy pasta, and the food just didn't taste like what we were used to.  Definitely won't be coming back here ever again."
Terri D.,"San Ramon, CA",3,10,1,1.0,7/31/2016,Worst curbside service. Order was not ready at time given. Didn't make something that was ordered because they were confused but never called for clarity. Frustrating especially when I have to be some place at a certain time and I'm still waiting 25 minutes past my pick up time.
Luis G.,"Dublin, CA",19,14,3,1.0,6/24/2015,"Just left this place and don't plan on going back anytime soon.  I think that when you go to a restaurant, you should have the same experience if you go in when they open or 5 min. before they close.  Got to the restaurant 30 min before closing. My wife and I spent the entire day at the fair with the kids and didn't have dinner. Not to mention that we hadn't seen each other over a week due to my job, so we wanted some us time. Got greeted by Michelle?  I think. Got the name from the check as she did not introduce her self. Instead she asked for our drinks and asked if we were ready to order. I didn't even get to open my menu, so we just ordered drinks. We had to repeat our selves a lot as she couldn't hear us. It wasn't because I wasn't loud enough, but due to the lack of attention span on this girl. She kept twitching and moving around like on some type of drug.  Anyways we finally got our drinks a little late as the bartender was in the restroom as Michelle said. We ordered our food but my wife couldn't get her food as the soup had been taken a way. So she only ordered a dinner salad.  Got our food and it wasn't that bad except that in my pasta I had angel pasta and penne pasta, but It didn't supose to come with it. You could tell that the cooks had sent the pasta baskets to the dish machine and they where just putting the pasta in the water, no big deal.  I know about 2 bites 2 minutes check back, but she came back and asked if she can bag it for us. I said no in a stern voice as I was starting to get annoyed. I also had to ask for bread, even though they usually bring it out before the meal. She had to check if they had any. I order dessert and coffee but she had to check if they had coffe, they did not, so I asked for dessert togo.  Over all a horrible experience. And the manager didn't make it any better yelling out to the kitchen ""no more orders ladies.""  If you want to cut labor or leave earlier, then change your operating hours."
Chris H.,"Hayward, CA",31,16,,1.0,6/9/2015,"This review is from our visit on 5/20/15. Been busy after this catastrophe of a visit and haven't had a chance to write a review yet.  We came by about 3pm for a late lunch/early dinner and was seated quickly. After about ten minutes I had to step away to take an urgent call, and when I returned about 10 minutes later, we only got our drink order taken.  A few minutes later, we watch the waitress tend to the person to my right (who already had an issue with her for throwing out the food she wanted to take home in a to go box), the people to my left, but ignored us.  After twice more in the next 5 minutes watching her talk to the people around us, but not even acknowledging us, we left. We never even got her name as she was just outright ignoring us. I spoke with Jennifer Carl, the manager who offered to comp us an appetizer, but why would we want an appetizer from a restaurant where the staff won't even acknowledge you?"
Vanessa C.,"Civic Center, San Francisco, CA",0,5,1,2.0,9/28/2015,"Sat at the bar and watched two tables sit down next to us. Both were greeted immediately and was greeted at about 20 min later after we walked over to a manager and asked for menus. The server was nice. However, we were told there were no avocado eggrolls. Opted for the sliders instead. Food was good but about ten minutes later a table sits down next to us and  orders the eggrolls. Overall, from two fellow servers and a bartender not our best experience when we were trying to get a quick bite between classes. Only bonus was that we waited so long it ended up being happy hour."
Deanna K.,"Castro Valley, CA",71,25,1,3.0,7/25/2016,If I dined only at the bar this place gets a 5 star every single time but I have to say every single time I have waited to be seated the service was more on a -5. I tried to be fair with a 3 star. We came here for a couple of big occasions one being a birthday where the waitress got into a fight with the manager and quit and the restaurant had totally forgotten that we were there.....another time for a graduation where everyone but one person had been served there food......they had boxed everything up and was giving us our bill when they were finally serving the one person in out party there food smh!
Maria D.,"San Ramon, CA",3,66,137,4.0,12/10/2014,"The two guys that created this theme restaurant were large and wanted a place with large portions like they would want and they certainly do it in style.  My favorite is the Chicken Chili.  I also like the hamburger - yes, I know, this is not a reason to come here as there are lots of other places for a good hamburger. Its in a busy mall and always very crowded so reservations are recommended, or try eating in the bar area or at the bar.  I suffer through the wait sometimes as I like this mall location as shop there often."
Jason H.,"Tigard, OR",2,5,2,1.0,8/31/2014,"Sunday afternoon, over 1.5hours before we got our food. I could scratches off the grime off from my unclean plate. #usesopeplease My friend 13$ veg. Berger - the bun was dead and gross.   Then desserts took another 15 mins.  Never again will I eat here, don't trust the cleanliness of the dishes. Food was OK  Hit up the the walnut creek restaurant."
Matt H.,"Danville, CA",8,39,29,5.0,6/6/2015,"I'm used to the long wait here, but my friend and I really didn't want to sit in the row of crowded tables this time. I went to the guy in glasses at the front, asked him if it was possible to get a booth. He checked my pager and said it may be just a few more minutes longer but he'd be more than happy to get us one.  Finally we are called and brought to a booth. Our server comes within minutes and think her name was Jenny.   I wasn't sure what I wanted, so she recommended a few dishes to us. I went with the Louisiana pasta and my friend got the rib eye. Everything came out great, rib eye was on point and my pasta was tasty. I've been to this location a few times where the people at the front were rude and food came out cold or slow service, but this time everything went perfect. Great service and great food this time and we left happy!"
Vishy J.,"Pleasanton, CA",12,2,,1.0,9/8/2015,"Very bad experience last night. Waited for an hour outside and then they took 20 mins to just bring water to our table. We were a group of 8 with 2 kids. Order lettuce wraps. The lettuce was very dry. Then the entrees were a disaster. Ordered eggplant parmesan and it was completely uncooked. I put my knife and was unable to cut the eggplant. Tasted absolutely raw. Ordered Evelyn's favorite paste and again uncooked very very dry pasta. Ordered alfredo pasta and what do you know? Overcooked tasteless pasta with alfredo sauce on the side? We talked to the waiter who was serving us and he had a rude reply for us. Everybody were starving. We finally decided to order pizza. Tooooo salty. I don't know why it was so bad last night. I am never going again cos I dont want to spend my 3 hours for such a bad service, food and an awful experience."
Roslyn Q.,"Sunnyvale, CA",0,7,1,1.0,1/29/2017,"Due to it being a Sunday, it is understandable that there is a considerable wait. However, the host marked us as ""Patio"" and I specifically said ""First Available"". We waited 45 minutes. Then, once we got to the table, we were starving so we ordered immediately. It too nearly an hour for our food, and then we only got it once we complained to the manager. He comped a cheesecake, and while appreciated, it was hardly sufficient for such a horrible wait and service. Definitely epic fail today. BTW, we ordered two burgers thinking that would be the quickest to the table!!! Ha!"
Argel D.,"Stockton, CA",0,11,,1.0,1/28/2017,"The food and service are not worthy of spending a ridiculous amount of time just to be seated. During peak hours, 2 hours even for a small group is customary. A bigger party was given an estimate of 3 hours. The place is understaffed, and the lack of waiters just worsens the waiting time even after you're seated. Even simple services such as bread and beverages take unreasonably long."
Freddie S.,"Pleasanton, CA",0,16,,1.0,2/14/2017,"Just like their management concern for pathetic and I mean PATHETIC service, never a response to one of our WORSE dining experiences EVER! if you want to wait 90 minutes, with inept management this is your kind of place!!!! Amazing not one follow up but I guess by the people waiting CF doesn't feel the need to."
D J.,"Alameda, CA",0,14,2,1.0,8/28/2015,"Currently here, crappiest service ever. The food is bomb, but service is almost inexistent. We seen her for our drink order and food order, haven't seen her since. Had to hunt down a host for a refill. All the tables around me are complaining. No manager in site, no one to even ask for a manager. For some reason, I always expected this place to be better. Although the food is good, it's not worth spending money considering the service aspect is horrible. I'm usually against writing negative yelps, but since there's no manager to assist me, I thought this would get a point across.  Just flat out horrible. If you wanna good meal, come here. If you care about service, DONT BOTHER."
Yvonne O.,"Soledad, CA",1,8,6,4.0,3/17/2015,"Never disappoints! After a long wait, even though it was a Monday night, we were seated and warmly greeted by our server Ivania. She was attentive but not overly bothersome & promptly brought us our drink order and took our food order. Dinner was delicious as expected. Loved the chicken madeira! Portions are so big you hardly have room left for dessert. Since eating cheesecake while at the cheesecake factory is a must, I ordered my slice of dulce de leche cheesecake to go. It was amazing! Not too over indulgent, just perfect. I'm glad I took Ivania's recommendation after I couldn't decide which to choose.  I have realized that no matter what Cheesecake Factory I go to, the service and food quality is always great. It's so great to see the consistency throughout the brand."
Kat F.,"Castro Valley, CA",0,26,2,2.0,1/22/2016,"My son and I stopped in to grab some slices of cheesecake to go about 3pm today. My lemon cheesecake had marshmallow on top that had been toasted WHY???  Since when does toasted marshmallow go on top of lemon cheesecake... The other was a chocolate chip cookie dough that looked as though someone had picked off the top and so was the other one we got carrot cake cheese cake WEIRD. Those two looked deformed.The only only that looked prefect was the apple crumble cheesecake. I spend $35.00 for 4 pieces of cheesecake and was so disappointed.  They have these cheese cakes in their case that are beautiful and perfect the ones except for one looked like hell and toasted marshmallow  on a lemon  cheesecake R E A L L Y!!! NEVER again Cheesecake Factory, never again....."
Ali W.,"Modesto, CA",0,40,10,4.0,12/29/2015,There's a wait but it's  worth it. Spend $25 for a gift card and get a free slice of cheese cake. Yay free cake. Food was cold had to return a plate to heat it back up so my daughter ate after everyone else. Long wait for cold food maybe that wasn't worth it. But the free cake was 5 slices can't wait to go back and get them.
Elms M.,"Elk Grove, CA",2,107,13,4.0,6/1/2016,"Different types of food, full menu, large portions, restaurant is huge and their cheesecakes are really sweet and yummy! My favorite is salted caramel and it has small chocolate chips in the middle. Agghhh, to die for! And everything I have eaten off their menu were fairly good.. Can't go wrong, as they also have a bar if you just want to do appetizers and drinks"
