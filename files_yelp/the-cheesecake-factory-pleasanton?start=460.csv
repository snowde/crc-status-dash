Shannon F.,"Pleasanton, CA",0,1,,5.0,2/5/2017,"My grandma, my boyfriend and I went for Sunday Brunch and the only way to describe the experience was WOW! The food was top notch best omelette I've ever had and awesome mimosas but the shining star of our experience was our waitress Lyric! She was so sweet and attentive definitely will come back!!"
Ricardo F.,"Redwood City, CA",49,8,4,1.0,12/22/2015,My wife's birthday we wait for a table and people that got in the restaurant after us where being call. I told the host that this was happening and she told me that I there where waiting in the out side. 20 min later something was happening again. They finally recognize that they did not call us. I ask for the manager and the manager told me they were sorry.  My wife was very mad. Never comeback.
Mark B.,"San Lorenzo, CA",0,1,,1.0,1/15/2017,"Ok first off the service here does not deserve a single star, wont recommend this place. My kids got so hungry waiting for our food,when we order our food we didnt get after an hour and 20 mins. We have to talk to the manager, and a minute right we talk to the manager our food start coming , by the looks and taste of it.we can tell our food have been forgotten, its probably been sitting out there in the kitchen for a while.our server was just passing as by not even to care."
Christina H.,"San Ramon, CA",23,163,71,2.0,9/4/2015,"I came here to buy a Cheesecake to go. The lady that helped me got my order wrong, the service was SLOW and not very good. I was given the wrong size and then when they fixed it they never really apologies. I don't think I would go back. But to sit down and eat? MAYBE"
Lori H.,"Tracy, CA",0,3,,1.0,2/2/2017,I ordered a cheesecake to be picked up after 5 pm.  Arrived there at 6 and no order was found so had to wait 45 minutes to pick up the order.  Second time this has happened in the last few months.  Poor customer Service.  Cheesecake is fabulous but very overpriced!!
Natalie C.,"Livermore, CA",26,44,14,1.0,5/4/2015,"Waiter ignored us but attended his other table next to us, asked another waiter to get us our bill because we could not enjoy our food while being treated this poorly, manager comes and comps our apps, seems to think its the wait time that bothered us, I reiterate that we felt neglected, it wasn't the wait. I've never left a restaurant by cancelling our order and leaving nearly in tears. Wasted a good night having to drive somewhere else to serve us. I believe the waiters name was Daniel, and we were sat at the back right, opposite of the restrooms"
Rachel L.,"Sacramento, CA",130,7,,3.0,8/3/2016,"To be honest, this location is just not the greatest. I've been to several other Cheesecake Factory locations and have had great experiences. We came when it was busy, so I can't really complain about the service - they were doing the best they could with craziness. The dinner was fine. I wasn't blown away with the pasta I got, but it was fine. The real disappointment for me was the cheesecake. We got the fresh strawberry cheesecake to go so we could eat it when we got home and watching a movie. But honestly the slice they gave us was sooo small that it was not a very shareable piece. The strawberry sauce too was a little much. I've have this cheesecake plenty of times at other locations and have been given a decently sized piece. So I was pretty disappointed to pay $7 for something so small. Will try to avoid this location."
Bradley P.,"Scottsdale, AZ",402,13,,1.0,7/13/2016,"We have been sitting here waiting to be seated for 2 hours now. Literally every single person that walks up right now gets seated within 5 minutes. If it were a Friday night I would understand, but it is a Wednesday night. This is absolutely the worst service I have ever received. Shameful location to the Cheesecake Factory."
Caitlin G.,"Tracy, CA",3,57,139,1.0,5/30/2016,"Why does this restaurant's restroom need so much attention every time I visit? I'm pretty disappointed in the inconsistency here. If they are not out of strawberry shortcake, then it's always something else. Sigh."
Stardust N.,"Alameda, CA",41,450,272,5.0,7/29/2014,"Went for lunch yesterday. We started with the ahi tare tare. I order it every time and I think this is actually my favorite ahi dish at the moment. The beau had the habachi steak (med rare) with fried asparagus.  For me, the steak diane with shrimp scampi. My steak was cooked perfectly also mid rare,  but the sauce wasn't my taste at all. The shrimp scampi is also fried which I didn't realize until they brought out the plate. I ordered under factory combos where they pair 1/2 portions of a few different meals. So there wasn't a full description and my scampi was fried. Also not my prefference. Lastly I subed the mashed potatoes for sweet potato fries which were delicious.  Over all the food was excuted perfectly and my ahi was as good as always.  I'll just try something different next time."
DeShawn A.,"Las Vegas, NV",232,202,209,1.0,6/5/2015,I WAS NOT impressed with this location! We had a group of 9 in our party and service was slow...food was gross. Food came out cold for almost our whole party and was sent back only to come out cold again. My daughter overheard one of the servers say they were glad they didn't get our table...I mean if you don't want to serve large parties find another job! I will NEVER go to this location again! If you want good food and great service avoid this location and go somewhere else!
Jo C.,"San Francisco, CA",0,4,,5.0,1/1/2017,"Tosha is the best and sweetest waitress! Though it was a long wait to be seated and to receive food, she checked up on us often and reassured us that the food would arrive soon. She was super nice and apologized for the slow service. Definitely someone who cares for her customers! The food was great too."
William F.,"San Ramon, CA",4,42,,2.0,1/20/2017,"Ah the cheesecake factory, delicious pastas and scrumptious cheesecakes. Or at least that's what I normally get when I go here. I'll admit, the kitchen is slow more often than not and this place gets pretty busy. However, the food is actually pretty good. Except on my last visit. Our appetizer was cold in the middle, when I brought it up to the waiters attention he quickly brought us another dish that was cooked perfectly this time. When our main course arrived, we were left with much to desire. My date and I both ordered the pasta carbonara, which tasted rather bland. I'm not sure if the sauce was all at the bottom or if they just barely put any on. The bacon in my dish was cooked excellently but all of my dates bacon pieces were burnt to a crisp, I kid you not. I got mine with chicken in it and even that was super bland. We would have sent it back but at that point we were pretty starved and there was no way we would have been able to stop eating and wait for a new dish even if it wasn't that good. To make up for it, our waiter was incredibly nice and understanding which definitely helped smooth over the rough patches. I have had much better experiences here in the past, so I hope that when I return, I can report back with a 5-star review, which is rather typical for my experience here, but last night they definitely missed the mark."
Marti J.,"Castro Valley, CA",0,6,,1.0,7/22/2016,"Friday night for dinner- DON'T GO!  When our name was called for a table (no pagers used), we waited while all others called were seated. When we informed the front desk we had been called, a ticket was printed and we were seated and ignore for over 10 minutes while everyone around us was waited on. We called over a waiter to ask who our waiter was and he said he'd check. He came back and said it was Daniel (who'd be right with us) and offered to take our drink order. Daniel, who had been continually schmoozing with the table behind us, didn't show up until after the first guy had taken our order and delivered the stale bread (another 10 minutes). The food is so-so and at this location, the service has been bad.  Get cheesecake to go and eat dinner anywhere else."
Fahm S.,"San Leandro, CA",0,27,,4.0,12/11/2016,"I came in with family this evening for my niece B-Day dinner. We were a family of 4. We arrived, and the place was so packed. The staff told us it will be a 35 minute wait for a table. No problem. We waited patiently. Finally we were called, and was seated. Our waitress Gabriella G. was very pleasant and professional. We were given a menu, and ordered drinks which took a long time, but she explained the transition of switching staff due to their shift ending. We received our appetizer first. We devoured it along with the breads. Asked for water and received it in a short time. Our drinks slowly made it to our table along with the main course. We had a mistake in our whole cheesecake to go, but no problem. We asked for a smaller size cheesecake, and they corrected the bill. One of the male waiter brought the Lg red velvet cheesecake, but I canceled it, coz my family prefer the original instead. He politely took it back, and our waitress brought the small original cheesecake which my family loves. Overall, our dinner experience was exceptional. The wait was long, but well worth it. I didn't get the young gentleman's name, but he was very professional and nice. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who likes to be treated with respect and great food! We'll be back soon!"
AshBash T.,"Grover Beach, CA",134,28,18,5.0,9/21/2015,The servers are really nice. Its usually crowded. Food is good . I like that I can shop around the mall while waiting on my table
Helen T.,"Hayward, CA",1,7,,2.0,1/9/2017,"I joined my husband for dinner on Thursday night about 7:30, of course this place is always packed. After I was told 40 min wait I went up to the hostess to see how close we were after an hour had went by. She told me I only had 2 more ahead of me. I watched 6 more parties get sat before I did some of which showed up well after I did. I wasn't pleased but oh well I had invested over an hour of my time, so I am sticking it out. Then once we were called we were sat right in the open with a wobbly table next to a very loud drunk couple. Service wasn't bad but you could tell the poor guy was slammed. Food was okay not great and then the cheesecake I had tasted old and dried out. I won't be going back to that location."
Karlo B.,"San Jose, CA",258,115,157,1.0,2/21/2015,"I wish I could give this place no stars. Expect a very long wait (at least 1 hr 30 mins). I sat down with my gf and waited another 20 mins to place my order. I had to go up and get my own water from the bar. The utensils were dirty and had to be replaced. I can go on and on...by far the worst experience that I have had with this restaurant.  For all you love birds and potential love birds out there, I wouldn't suggest taking your first date here because of everything I just mentioned. The dessert took around 20 mins to get to us also. This is definitely the WORST restaurant experience I've had in my life. The check was the only thing that got to me quickly! Please, if you're in the mood for cheesecake, just keep driving to San Jose or Walnut Creek!"
Sam R.,"Union City, CA",31,9,3,5.0,6/20/2016,"Being an avid cake lover ,the Cheesecakes here are by far the best I have had in Bay Area!!  This will be my place for all the special family occasions coming up! Thumbs up to this place :D"
Angela K.,"Novato, CA",186,536,98,3.0,7/9/2015,"I've got to say their tiramisu almost rivals my family's recipe.  Always a great place for dessert not matter the time of day.  Their menu is like a phonebook , very extensive.  I recommend taking an online looksie of their food selections if you're uncertain of what you might want to eat.  The menu can be overwhelming in hand at first.  But whatever you do, don't leave without dessert."
