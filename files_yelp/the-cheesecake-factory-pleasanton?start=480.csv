Patrick X.,"Los Angeles, CA",61,5,1,2.0,5/31/2016,"I have been here more times than I can count or care to. I can say that the food is good when the cook decides to. On all occasions of coming here, I have also experienced at least one unpleasant element that left me not wanting to come back (but the GF has built up a strong tolerance to variation in quality of entrees as this is the only place she could get her beloved Pasta Da Vinci...). First the food, I always get at least one of the following: Pasta da Vinci, Steak Diane, Chicken Madeira. As for the appetizers: Firecracker Salmon, Avocado Eggrolls, Spinach crab dip. Those are my go to and recommendations. I have also enjoyed the Farfalle Garlic Pasta, Spicy Chipotle Pasta, Louisiana Chicken Pasta but nothing beats the all time Pasta DaVinci.  What are some of my unpleasant experiences? I have experienced long waits for food (up to an hour of just munching on their bread and butter), getting ignored on requests, receiving cold dishes. There are many more that I can nitpick but one that was absolutely not forgivable was the missing of an entire side and several key ingredients in a dish. I ordered the steak Diane with side of smashed potato. It came cold and missing mashed potato, onions, and mushrooms. After asking about it, the waiter had said we requested to have no mashed potato which we didn't and the mushroom and onions were just plain missing. After everything was sorted, we had spent 3 hours attempting to eat one dish.  Overall, expect to kill about 2-3 hours to fully finish eating your food and getting the bill. Food is good but will depend on whether you're lucky enough."
Lee B.,"Pleasanton, CA",23,65,15,2.0,6/18/2015,"Always a long wait and not worth it. Loud and crowded. The menu is huge, but I've never had anything good here...except the cheesecake. Come here for a slice of cheesecake to go. Even then, prepare to wait. Usually nice service though!"
Sabrina W.,"Pleasanton, CA",100,5,1,1.0,5/14/2016,Slowly and gradually declining. Been waiting currently an hour and ten minutes and there are plenty of available tables. A customer proceeded to argue that she was promised to only wait 20 minutes for a table and complained to the hostess with such rage that she got seated immediately. I'm not a confrontational person but this is not right when I feel the need to go back and complain like the lady before me in order to get seated in a decent amount of time. Very sad.
Gail W.,"Pleasanton, CA",0,4,,3.0,12/30/2016,"Why do you allow dogs in the restaurant?  The dog I saw did not have a vest or anythimg indicating it was an assistance dog.  This is against health code!  I love dogs, but they don't belong around people eating in a restaurant."
Willis W.,"Livermore, CA",87,6,,2.0,2/20/2016,"Hostess tried to seat us inside when we asked for outside, and then asked us to wait five minutes for the next outdoor table. Five minutes roll by and a second hostess tries again to seat us inside again. And then we were asked by a third hostess (the one who originally asked us if we wanted to sit outside or in) that we needed to wait some more claiming that she paged us when she didn't. Meanwhile several tables have been seated outside. After we get seated we find that the silverware was super dirty (rice was stuck to a fork). Food was average, as expected."
Mina K.,"Little River, CA",0,3,,1.0,12/28/2016,"I was in the service industry for 6 years, waiting tables in restaurants and bars. Never in my career have I seen so much neglect and laziness. I went with my mother last night she is a senior with type 2 diabetes. We were greeted with a very sweet and kind front desk hostess who took the time that night to do her makeup, nice eyes with silver lining. She called us when table was ready. We had to wait standing up as every time the door opened near the waiting area we were hit with freezing cold winds. We sat down and ordered our dinners. I requested a gluten free salmon and vegetables with potato dinner and the waitress was confused and came back twice with confusing explanations of what exactly had gluten in the dinner. Was it the potatoes or the broccoli. It was the potatoes. The broccoli never came as it was stolen by another waiter supposedly. The appetizer we ordered never came and 20 minutes later she shows up and acts suprised and says "" oh, no one brought you the appetizer "" then comes back and says they don't have anymore artichoke dip. But did not offer to bring back menus for us to look at appetizers so we just didn't get an appetizer. After we were done eating our entire dinner the broccoli arrives and as she approaches our table with the plate of broccoli she stops in her tracks and holds the plate a way and realizes how late it' is and says with a disappointing look "" oh should I just bag it up to go for you "" ? My mom and I at this point thought a candid camera might be peeping around the corner.. But no this was real and not a joke. The entire time we were ignored. Our tea and hot water forgotten and not refilled. Wait was rediculous and our eyes were always fixated down the row of booths waiting and praying she will come back again. Table never once serviced or cleaned we were not taken care of at all. Our dinners came out seperately instead of all at once. We had to ask and then wait for EVERYTHING. The waiter seemed out of touch untrained lazy and slow. With an airy non caring demeanor. It was pretty much a joke. Instead of dealing with us she brought out the manager in a lazy way as if she shouldn't have to bother with her mess. This was such an amateur set up, kind of ghetto. Nothing like any chessecake factory experience we've had previously. The manager treated this as if it was no big thing and wasn't serious at all and gave 1 piece of a 1 inch pie covered in 4 inches of nasty whip cream to my diabetic mom and expected this to be the problem solver of the rediculous and annoying experience we had. I guess that's their policy, if anything goes wrong give them a piece of cheesecake and they'll shut up. My mom was shocked. Did they want us to share this 1 piece of tiny cheesecake slithered with whip cream? In my days working in this industry the manager would have apologized, given out dinner cards, and refered us to one of the top waiters they had. And definitely wouldn't give a blob of sugar to a senior with diabetes expecting to make up for their lack of basic service and neglect. If I wanted my dinner to be a mishmash of things and late to the table then I could have just STAYED HOME!"
Margaret S.,"Pleasanton, CA",1,36,10,1.0,11/21/2016,"We have been going here since it opened.  Usually it is somewhat so-so.  We started sitting at the bar hoping for service (cuz if you sit at a table - good luck ever seeing your server).  My husband and I went this last Sunday 10:30am (the place was pretty much empty).  Order from the the bartender - waited 40 minutes for my cold omelette, the potatoes were burnt (and cold) my husband had eggs and potatoes (burnt and cold) - which i told her - she asked if i wanted to take it back (like i wanted to wait another 40 mins).  I barely ate it.  She could of cared less. It was my bad for not sending it back but this place could care less.  To make matters worst we order a cheesecake for dessert for later that night (don't ask me why) I swear it had been frozen for a long time - watery cheesecake and crust stale and gross - never again CKF!!!  Oh and by the way I already went to your website and logged a complaint.  I am sure you will do nothing to improve."
Georgia R.,"Livermore, CA",0,13,,4.0,6/29/2016,Old reliable. Always consistent and always delicious.  Asian chicken salad on point and delish!!
Janette P.,"Hercules, CA",64,13,12,4.0,6/10/2016,"Great experience here. Said we would have to wait 10-15 minutes for our table but less than 5 minutes and we were being seated. Our server, Jeanine, was very friendly and busy as well. I got the Baja chicken tacos which were so delicious, worth $13. But the side rice was not cooked well, pretty crunchy. Probably just a bad batch. Also, the hibiscus lemonade was amazing. Would definitely go back to try some of the many menu choices they have!"
Dana L.,"Union City, CA",45,226,70,1.0,3/28/2015,I see why there are such low ratings. I ordered a cheesecake and the people behind the cheesecake counter are just slow!!  and then they managed to screw up my order..... thanks for taking my money??
Brandon L.,"San Francisco, CA",102,1,,1.0,3/8/2016,"Horrible service. Consistently the slowest wait times ever. When it's busy, the wait times are ridiculous, so I go when the place is EMPTY and somehow the wait time for our food was even worse. Literally the only customer ordering takeout and almost every table in the place is empty and my order took over 30 minutes for one order or Baja tacos. Had to ask where my order was twice because the first time they just assured me it would be ready very soon and of course it wasnt. Every time I come here the service sucks and the food does too. Will never come back."
Mariko M.,"San Francisco, CA",146,102,50,2.0,3/13/2015,"I really, really, really detest chain restaurants especially chain restaurants who have BOOKS for menus. It's never a good sign when an establishment clearly has no focal point and offers anything from Chinese food to Italian.  My sister loves to drag me to places like this. It was Sunday and I wanted to do some shopping at the mall. And this place is connected to the mall. How....Convenient....  We waited OVER an hour to be sat for a party of two. It was fairly obvious to me that the hostess had completely forgotten about us because everyone else we ""arrived"", meaning people who had put their names before and after us, had ridiculously numbered parties of 6 or 10 and they were seated first. We kept waiting and waiting and waiting until a manager had to step in and fix the hostess's mistake. I was seething...  Once we sat, the table next to us ALSO looked unhappy. Apparently they had been waiting for their main course entrees for over an hour. I inspected my silverware and there was old crusted food and something that looked like white paint all over my utensils. I was getting less and less hopeful and decided to drown my doubts and negative feelings with brunch appropriate cocktails. Got a new set of silverware, and I ordered the kale and quinoa salad to speed up the kitchen process. Our server was good and attentive, and the floor manager assigned to our area always checked in on us. The service once we sat down was good but I just couldn't get over my overall negative vibes from this place. The servers and runners looked exhausted and short staffed and everyone was trying very hard to make it a good day but I was not feeling it. Our entire dining experience was close to 3 hours long."
Kelly C.,"San Ramon, CA",0,5,,1.0,12/23/2016,"This review is the result of a number of incidents and only applies to the Pleasanton location, Walnut Creek is awesome.  I would also like to add that this has nothing to do with the waitresses.  The service, whether picking up an order or trying to get seated has been completely disorganized and absolutely substandard. We have never been there when we haven't had to wait an inordinate length of time. We have phoned in orders, gone to pick them up and had to wait in excess of 30-40 minutes just to pick up. The staff does not appear to want to help. We called in to order and was left on hold for 20 minutes, hung up, called back left on hold for several additional minutes. We finally hung up, called the Walnut Creek location and placed our order in less than 3 minutes. The order really was that simple, but the Pleasanton staff do not appear to be in the service mode of the service industry."
Jas R.,"Hayward, CA",0,3,1,1.0,12/22/2016,"This review is in regards to the customer service that was given to my family and I on Dec.  18.  - Reserved a table for Party of 9 at 11:45 AM.  - Around 12:15 PM my dad went to ask how much longer and the host said that it would be another 30-45 minutes because they claimed to call us twice before and no one answered so they would have to add us to the list again.  - Had the manager (Jesse) come over very rudely only to tell us that because we didn't hear them call us that we had to wait. - A manager should never tell the customer they are wrong. She should not have come up to us and told us that because 9 people supposedly didn't hear them call, that we now had to wait longer. - While we were sitting there people were being called and seated.  - There were hosts that even went outside to call people in. - They claimed to call us two times and gave up. - We left soon after they told us to wait another 30-45 minutes. The manager did not help and was rude to us the whole time.  - Her attitude as soon as she came up to us was not appropriate and she would not listen to what we had to say.  - As I was telling her (Jesse) that she was not giving quality customer service, she walked away and never came back. I had to go ask another host what her name was because she wasn't wearing a name tag.  - Will not be going back anytime soon.  - Don't go with a group bigger than 2 people."
Chardonnai S.,"San Lorenzo, CA",96,88,94,4.0,5/20/2014,I go to this location most of the time. I remember when they first opened and I attended their soft open. I enjoyed it then and I still enjoy this location. The servers are always pleasant. I like that they will let you try a little soup before you order it if you would like to see how it tastes first. Everyone that eats here knows they have an extensive cheesecake menu but I usually don't eat any of it. I have recently found they have the best strawberry shortcake ever. I have to admit this will be my choice for dessert when ever I can fit it in my meal.
Carina P.,"Castro Valley, CA",6,145,472,4.0,5/3/2016,The only time i come here is for lunch. Forget about dinner time! the line would be out the door lol. Lunch portions are supposed to be small and half the regular portions but they're still pretty big so there's never enough room for cheesecake! the food and drinks are really good
Maicheal S.,"Dublin, CA",0,12,,4.0,12/20/2015,"Four stars for the food and zero*for the service Every time I go in there I enjoy the food and the drinks, but they always hire you employees who doesn't know what the hell they're doing"
Ar F.,"Hayward, CA",0,37,24,1.0,3/9/2016,"The worst service. I went tonight to Cheese cake factory. Very impolite waiter and I paid 5% tip because of bad services. Also, I think now, 5% tip was very high for their services. I will never try again. Before this time I went to cheese cake factory in San Jose and I must say if you want to have a good lunch or dinner do not try this."
Mauricio D.,"Dublin, CA",32,17,7,3.0,8/18/2015,The jambalaya is my favorite dish here.  This time around the rice did not seem well cooked. Also the waiter that initially served us was not good in following up and filling up beverages for our crew. Once he left the waitress that took over was pleasant and attended to all 8 of us very well.
Kenny W.,"Suisun City, CA",448,118,46,2.0,2/8/2015,"The wait time was not bad, but the service was slow. Unorganized and we had to wait longer than tables next to us. I ordered the brunch and the pancakes are horrible. Not to mention the syrup was poor in taste. Not sweet at all. My pancake tasted like the stove. What I mean it tasted really fried! Gross after taste!"
