marlon m.,"Union City, CA",0,40,15,1.0,3/1/2015,"1 1/2 hour wait, Pretty consistent long wait and people at the check in has no idea on whats going on, we followed up on the sitting manager she could Care less.  its just too much people everytime. Not worth the wait. This restaurant just plain sucks!! Go to redwood city i get sitted there less than 10min. Everytime."
Jane L.,"Las Vegas, NV",2,8,,1.0,10/7/2015,"Ok, please do not eat at this place if you value your health. They served us prawns that were not cleaned before cooking (wtf) fries that were cold and rubbery and deep fried things that were so squishy that they fell apart on their own. The only plus about this complete disgusting ""restaurant"" is that the Mojito was somewhat drinkable.  Why would you choose to go somewhere so awful when there are so many other choices? Do yourself a favour and go somewhere else.. somewhere where you won't die."
Tim S.,"Tracy, CA",10,14,30,4.0,7/11/2015,We had a great visit this evening! Our server was fantastic. My son's pizza got burned a bit so she had the kitchen make a new one. I had the Thai Salmon. It was a special that wasn't listed on the menu. Delicious! I love this restaurant because of the variety of entrée choices. We never leave here hungry
Mehndi M.,"Modesto, CA",48,255,271,3.0,3/4/2016,"Just like any old Cheesecake Factory. Nothing incredibly special about this location. It is very beautiful inside. In the evenings, sometimes the lighting is so low you can barely read the menu but I guess that's what the flashlight on the iPhone was made for. We always have good service when we are here."
Karen S.,"Berkeley, CA",0,16,20,1.0,1/3/2015,"I usually don't like leaving poor reviews but our experience was so terrible I feel it's warranted. I am used to long wait times at the SF Cheesecake Factory but once seated I've never had an issue and they were always very organized. Not so with this location. The other day three of us went to this Cheesecake Factory location for the first time. We wanted to sit and order some cheesecakes before eating elsewhere and were told the wait would be 15-20 minutes. We had time to kill so we looked at the selections in the case until our names were called. At this point we figured we might as well just eat dinner here. We were brought to our table only to be promptly turned around because it had not been bused. Okay, fine, so they would clear it and seat us, right? Well, they proceeded to seat three groups AFTER us while we were still waiting for our table to be cleared. Wouldn't it have made more sense to seat us first and then the groups after us once the table was cleared? 10-15 minutes later we were still waiting with no updates while the woman who had led us to our table earlier did her best to completely ignore us. Then we overheard a busboy who had been standing near our table come up to the front and say to the front of house staff, ""I tried to clear the table."" How does one TRY to clear a table? We realized that NO ONE had bothered to even clear our table the entire time we had been waiting. At this point we no longer wanted to patronize this business so as we left we let the front of the house know we were going and she said, ""But your table's almost ready."" Yeah, and you almost got our business."
Nick S.,"Hayward, CA",160,26,29,3.0,6/20/2015,It's Cheesecake Factory... Arrive with reasonable expectations and you will be alright. Avocado egg rolls are the main reason i come back.
Old B.,"Palo Alto, CA",9,237,911,3.0,3/24/2016,"Do not go here during peak hours, or if you see people waiting around, outside. Just isn't worth it. Also, even if you are lucky enough to get there during an off hour, service is so stretched you could end up being right in the middle of the chaos, before your meal is delivered My dishes have always been good, huge proportions, but I don't go back very often, and definitely wouldn't recommend, if you're in rush."
Peter P.,"Tracy, CA",25,27,,2.0,3/16/2015,"I think the best way to give this review is to just say what my family and I ordered, and what we got instead. We ordered Buffalo Wings for an appetizer, with ranch dressing instead of the Bleu Cheese. I asked for the Factory Grande Burrito and a Strawberry Lemonade.  I asked if the guacamole/sour cream/etc was outside of the burrito or not.  Our waiter explained that they put it outside.  I asked if they could put all of that within the burrito instead, and he said okay. My wife asked for the Ahi Tuna Salad (I don't remember the exact name) and a Margarita. For our two boys, one wanted the Mini Sliders with Fresh Fruit and Milk.  Our other son wanted the Chicken Strips with French Fries and Apple Juice. Let's start with the drinks.  My wife and I got our drinks before the kids, and they even brought out the wings before our kids got their drinks.  I would think that a restaurant would try to bring out the kids' drinks first, as kids are usually the quickest to complain; we had to let them share sips of our water because they didn't even have cups of water for the kids.  When the kids finally got their drinks, it was two apple juices, but the waiter was in such a hurry that they left before we could say anything.  After a bit we let them know they got the order wrong and we got the milk. The wings were good, but the dipping sauce was either bleu cheese, or the cheesiest ranch dressing I've ever had. My burrito came and the guacamole/sour cream/salsa/etc was not outside the burrito.  It also wasn't IN the burrito.  They just left it out completely. My son's chicken strips were served with fresh fruit, even though he ordered the fries.  My other son had NO side dish served with his Mini Sliders.  The waiter assured us the fries were coming; they never came. The kids and I had finished our drinks, but the waiter never came by for free refills.  He DID ask my wife if she wanted another Margarita, though. For me, it's unfortunate when a restaurant gets an order wrong or mixed up, but it's also understandable.  It's pretty bad, though, when you mess up almost EVERY order; the only order without a problem was my wife's salad.  I don't think we'll come back here because of that.  Plus we paid $90 for the meal.  The only reason this place doesn't get one star is because the food was decent."
S F.,"San Francisco, CA",269,43,26,1.0,4/30/2016,"Worst customer service ever. Had an absolutely awful experience. Our waitress, a Filipino girl in her mid-twenties was completely unprofessional and acted like a high school child. Unfortunately, I was unable to get her name -  but her counterpart, Tori, was just as bad. I asked to speak with the manager, a hispanic lady, who was completely worthless and had no idea how to manage any issues. I'll not be returning to this location due to their inability to hire quality service. Definitely not what I expect from Cheesecake Factory."
Pauline M.,"Livermore, CA",0,205,799,1.0,6/12/2015,"Cheesecake Factory is your everyday chain restaurant.  We stopped in during a shopping day.  At 11:30am we expected decent service since the lunch crowd hasn't started.  We had to wait five minutes to be seated.  Waited another five for table service.  ""Byron"" introduced himself and we ordered two iced water with lemons, Chinese Chicken Salad and Fish & Chips.  The bread today was not warm or soft.  After we finished our salad, Byron came to collect the plate and offered the dessert menu.  I asked about the Fish & Chips and he NEVER put in the order.  How could he handle lunch crowds???"
Vivien L.,"Austin, TX",1,5,2,2.0,8/15/2015,"Food: 2 stars. Jambalaya was okay, not too good not too bad. Buffalo wings, horrible. Cheesecake was good. Service: 3 stars. Our waitress was perfect but we asked another waiter for a fork because we have four people but there was only three forks and he told our waitress to give us a straw... Cleanness: 2 stars. I think the table and chairs were okay, however be prepared to have dirty plates, every plates on our table were dirty and I suggest to bring your own."
Dori B.,"San Francisco, CA",14,9,1,5.0,9/14/2015,"Yum! I love The Cheesecake Factory and have never been disappointed! Went here tonight with my cousin and we had a great time and really enjoyed the food.  They were busy but the service was still great! Our server was Amanda W, and she was the sweetest. Great service, we didn't wait long for anything and she was very helpful when it came to describing food on the menu and helping us decide what to order.  We ordered the avocado egg rolls which were really delicious, definitely a must have! Amanda recommended the bacon-bacon burger since I was in the mood for either meatloaf or a burger and I was happy she recommended that! Definitely one of the best burgers I have ever had!  Not only was the food great, but the service was as well. Amanda was sweet and even though they were busy tonight, she was always coming by with a smile on her face and asking how the food was and if we needed anything else; my cousin and I really appreciate that kind of service, thank you!"
Garrett S.,"Lower Hills, Oakland, CA",2,51,9,5.0,4/9/2016,"My girlfriend and I were craving Cheesecake Factory so we decided to stop in even though we knew it would be crazy busy (Friday night). We only waited approximately 10 minutes before being sat. I have to say that I received just about the best service I have ever had at Cheesecake Factory. Potentially the best service ever. Our server, Caitlin, was: humorous, attentive, fast and outstanding. She was so awesome that she inspired me to serve MY tables better at my own restaurant. I often feel like a lot of servers, including myself, become robotic after a long shift. It's hard to make a connection with each and every table you serve. So I really appreciated that Caitlin made us feel at home. It really comes down to the simplest of things, for example: bringing out another side of ranch when I'm running low or offering ranch in lieu of bleu cheese in the first place since I don't like bleu cheese on my Buffalo Blasts (which are awesome, you should try it). The water refill ratio was in the 97 percentile, like, my thirst has never been so quenched. The bread looked neat when it came out. Her hair was nice. The food is always good, etc etc. Thanks, Caitlin!"
Frances P D.,"San Mateo, CA",209,43,39,4.0,4/2/2015,"They were able to accommodate my multiple requests on my burger: made it protein style and replaced mayo with avocado. (The avocado was still in tact-- I should have asked them to smear instead.) The chicken piccata is always bombdotcom. Minus the 1 star because we were standing at the counter for 1/2 a min before either of the 2 hostesses noticed us. (It could've been because it was already 10p and we're both dark-skinned and because of the dim-light setting... and they were looking down behind their counter.) In short, I'd return."
Ariena J.,"Hayward, CA",1,28,53,5.0,3/6/2015,This place is always amazing never lets me down amazing spaghetti amazing food amazing service they're always pop in on Friday and Saturday nights. There was a older lady who helped us and she had the best hospitality that I've ever had at the cheesecake factory the drinks are amazing I have pictures you just have a good time the outside heaters work really good it was really cold but the heaters definitely work. I would recommend this to any outsiders any visitors to the Pleasanton area definitely go there if they have something on the menu for everybody also a must try the vanilla bean cheesecake. That's my favorite there it's amazing it's just to die for.
Samsung K.,"Tiburon, CA",0,1,3,1.0,5/28/2016,"We went here to have a slice of cake & a cup of coffee after having a very satisfying vegetarian meal. We were asked to wait for 15 minutes, but after half an hour, our buzz buzzing, we gave it to the receptionist girlb she said our table was being cleaned. Waiting for another 15 minutes still no one took us to our table, asked the girl she said still being cleaned, wait another 15 minutes so total of 30 minutes for our table being cleaned, asked the waiter about our table, he said still being cleaned. I told him that they should not buzz us if the table wasn't ready.  He raised his shoulder, made a face to me, upset. Eventually, we sit in a table. When we look at our saucers, both are dirty. There are chewing gum on the side & at the bottom of them. We showed them to the waiter, he just took them away without apologizing. This is the worst of the worst cheesecake factory restaurant we have ever been to.  Bad attitude of the receptionist & DIRTY!!!"
Elsie F.,"Pleasanton, CA",0,23,,1.0,11/6/2016,"Really want to love this place, but can't deny the three disappointing visits in a row.  The wait times after placing your order are simply ridiculous, over 45 minutes to an hour every time.  The service is scattered and unpredictable, and the conversation with the waiter is mostly a string of apologies for forgetting utensils, the delayed service, mistake with the order etc etc.  We go to other high volume restaurants in town (California Pizza Kitchen, Lazy Dog, On The Border etc), but this place is hands down the most poorly managed, inefficient, unpleasant dining experience of the bunch.  Zero stars."
Deandra H.,"San Leandro, CA",31,8,2,1.0,4/20/2016,I will never come back there again. For one its two dark and for two I ordered a cheese cake that had like a 7 inch blond hair baked into it. When I told the waitress she told me that she could COMP my order and she brought me another one but was going to charge me for it! Saying they don't comp for things like hair they just bring you a new piece. Never again. Gross.
Destry H.,"Alameda, CA",188,207,998,4.0,1/21/2014,"The Cheesecake Factory located in Pleasanton is one of my family's favorite restaurants to dine. We were quietly celebrating our daughter's 14th birthday and although our server ""Kiara"" didn't know it, she made our day. Kiara was extremely attentive, genuinely friendly and was a pleasure to have had as our server of the day! It is the continued high level of service, quality and preparedness of the entrees and the overall experience we consistently receive here that keeps my family and I coming back!"
Dannielle D.,"San Dimas, CA",219,91,117,3.0,5/7/2015,It's all about what you order at cheesecake. I don't go often but it's always hit and miss: White chicken chili - good but the portion got smaller over the years Jamaican black pepper shrimp - Missing pepper and had a OK tasting sauce..The black beans and mango salsa were good but did NOT go with the shrimp at all. Weird combo. Eggplant Parmesan - delicious! Best veggie dish ever.
