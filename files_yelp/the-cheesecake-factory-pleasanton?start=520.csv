Bella P.,"Fresno, CA",328,50,137,5.0,11/5/2015,"The food was so great that I forgot to take the picture's of my sliders and my Salad. My friends order so many different dishes since she doesn't have this restaurant's where she lives at with this kind of caliber, it blew her mind!!!!This visit was over a month ago but nothing changed. I'll put up pics on are next outing. So for a nice place that has happy hour with sweet deals and the best Cheesecake I've ever had this is a must. I'll be there this weekend and I'm excited, so come join me or just come & enjoy they fresh food with a smile."
Susana D.,"San Ramon, CA",5,15,,5.0,10/16/2016,"Here on a rainy Sunday, thinking it may be slow but wishful thinking we still had a 40 minute wait. After getting seated we literally waited another 40 to get our food. BUT Jeanie our server was amazing. Very attentive and apologetic. Although it was nothing she could control she always kept us in the loop. Thanks Jeanie for all your hard work! Your a keeper!"
Scott D.,"Martinez, CA",130,59,4,1.0,8/1/2016,"What ever happened to Cheesecake Factory? It was always top notch service. We went tonight and it started with a long wait of course with only two tables taken outside and about 16 empty ones. Then we finally get seated, it takes forever to get our food. I ordered the Chicken Madera my favorite. In the first bite I can feel chunks in it. I look and it's all kinds of stuff Corn, zucchini, onion, mango, none of which are in this dish. I show the server and you could tell she was surprised and very nice. The manager comes over and says ""I guess they made it to close to other things, I'll let them know"". Didn't offer to take it and started to walk away. Excuse me I didn't order the casserole surprise! I politely asked her to have it remade. She leaves and after about 20 minutes the waitress comes by and apologizes for it taking so long. I waited another 10 minutes and told the waitress to let the manager know never mind my party is all done eating. After another wait the manager comes back with the meal in a bag. Really what a joke! If I wanted to go food I wouldn't of waited 30 minutes to be seated and another 30 minutes for the food. Sad it used to have good customer service! And apparently they put whatever they want in the food and you need to just eat it."
Jodi F.,"Tracy, CA",24,10,1,1.0,11/19/2016,"Headed here with a group of 8 to celebrate my birthday. Waited an hour and a half to be seated. Took us to a booth that was meant for four. Told that half the menu was unavailable because they ran out we all settled on a meal. Everyone was served at separate times and the 3 year old was served last. No refills on drinks, over cooked burgers, undercooked pasta and simply disappointing. Waiter brought the check and never asked about dessert ( hello it's the Cheesecake Factory) My husband goes to talk to the manager and she says she would do something for us.... took $30 off my $200 bill. Thanks. In a last ditch effort to make me feel better my husband goes to order cheesecake at the counter. 75% of flavored are out and when we say we want the plain one sitting in the window the woman says "" no the piece would be too small and it would be cheating you."" Huh? Total trip 4 hrs, $200 and a disappointing experience."
Tammie J.,"San Francisco, CA",113,9,,1.0,8/6/2016,"Horrible long waiting times during the busy weekend the staff were not forthcoming about the long wait. I waited nearly TWO HOURS to be seated after being told I would only have to wait 50 minutes, the food was not that great. I would suggest another restaurant. They have a habit of not bringing bread. During busy times, the food taste worse. I don't plan on going back, at least to this location."
Kelly A.,"Reno, NV",299,4,,1.0,4/30/2016,"This is probably the worst run Cheesecake Factory dessert section ever. Ordered over the phone at 7:00 for a 7:45 pickup and get there and apparently never received a call about my order. So they took 45 minutes to ""find"" a new one, and in the end not give us the correct order.. Unfortunately the young girl who I was talking to on the phone was nowhere to be found. I agree that they were slammed and I appreciate the hard work. But honestly if you take a phone order and then ""lose"" it and then take 45 more minutes to give it to us is incompetent and awful customer service!"
Erika C.,"Sunnyvale, CA",144,32,5,1.0,1/14/2016,"We went to Cheesecake Factory at the end of December in 2015. When we arrived we were told that the wait time was 30-40 minutes. We waited outside in the waiting area.There was another party of 4 who was seated before us and had checked in after we did. There was also another family with a disabled person who had checked right after us and told their wait was 30-40 minutes. So I checked back in with a worker by the name of Lyric (a young black female) worker who was in charge of the lists. When I inquired about where we were on the lists, she immediately stated oh you have another 25 minutes. She didn't look at the list for my name and we had already been waiting for 30 minutes. I woo-saahhhed and went to the side to wait and watch how lyric was going to interact with the other customers. As I watched for the next 20 minutes, I noticed her interactions were more positive then what she had showed me. The next time we went to follow up on our table I sent my sister over. Lyric was better with her interaction and stated that we were the next table of 4 to be seated.  Needless to say we were not the next party of four to be seated. When were finally seated it took an additional 10 minutes or so for a waiter to come to our table.  When our food arrived it took an additional 35 minutes and the food was cold and our order was wrong. As we were almost finished with our meal we realized that the family with the disabled family member were still sitting outside. Mind you the wait time was supposed to be 30-40 minute the family had been forgotten about and had waited for almost 2 hours!!! The speaker for the outside people did't seem to be working and the workers didn't have the common courtesy to go outside to check if the parties were ready or inform them that their table was ready. I go the Cheesecake Factory all the time;however its the one in San Jose at Valley Fair!!! On this day,it has confirmed that I will not being coming back!! Between the rude and unhygienic worker Lyric. The inattentiveness staff  and how they selectively chose to seat people out of order, it was chaotic and their customer service SUCKED!!!! We spent a pretty decent amount of money with them that day and still tipped the waiter well due to the cooks not getting our orders right. The manager was of no assistance and I am just confused where they received their training~ If you're hungry I do not reccommend that you go to this Cheesecake Factory!!  UNPROFESSIONAL!!!!!! AND RUDE AS HELLL!!!"
Bryan S.,"Modesto, CA",65,4,1,1.0,10/28/2016,"To load for a conversation. On a slow night waited 30 minutes for a table. Another 40+ minutes for bread, butter, water and my food. The people behind me got say and their food delivered before I did."
Jerrica N.,"Danville, CA",999,312,1427,4.0,12/10/2013,"I know that the cheesecake factory is a chain and this is one chain restaurant that I actually like. They have a huge array of items on the menu that will for sure please any palette. Plus, their cheesecakes really are that good! This place was packed by the time we got there (6:30). We ordered some kind of spicy thai wrap for an app, I got the cajun pasta and my friend got the shrimp scampi. O-EM-GEE!! I have never gotten that thai wrap before and it is that flippin good! The sauce has a little kick, just enough to waken the senses in your mouth. The red cabbage is drenched in the sauce and can be eaten as a little side salad. The wrap remained crunchy even with the sauce all over it, I absolutely hate when things that are meant to be crispy come our soggy. The cajun pasta was different from what I normally order. There was a good amount of depth in flavors and the portion was too big for me to finish. I really like that they don't skimp on the meat and shrimp and the shrimp are the jumbo prawns not the cheapy kind. I normally order the shrimp scampi and it came out just as good that night. I love the complimentary bread! Especially the wheat bread, at least I think it is wheat bread... We stayed there pretty long time and the waitress didn't rush us out. She was very nice and atentative. Of course I finished off the meal with the staple cheesecake and loved every bite of it! Yay for cheesecake factory!"
Ryan S.,"Union City, CA",0,2,,1.0,10/26/2016,"If i could give less than one star i would. HORRIBLE service. I stood in line at the pick up area and waited there for 15min before one of the 4 people behind the counter even acknowledged me. I was told my order would be ready at 9:05 and it is currently 9:30 and my order still isn't ready. I ordered a slice of cheesecake, i thought i could eat while i wait. But with 5 people behind the counter it still took 20min just for me to get my slice of cheescake. All in all i waited 1 whole our AFTER the time i was told my food would be ready. Save your time and go to a different restaurant."
Alexa J.,"Henderson, NV",768,68,23,1.0,5/31/2016,"This 1 star review, is based on multiple dining experiences here... I actually love Cheesecake Factory, but every time I have dined at this location- I am so upset that I chose this restaurant over the others in the area. My last time eating there, Sunday- was a disaster. To sum it up, we placed our order as soon as our server dropped off our drinks. More than 1 hour later, our food was brought. We were told that the kitchen was very busy, and that was the cause of delay. The first plate that was brought out, was wrong...So my server took it back and immediately returned with my order. I had ordered the chicken bacon avocado sandwich with fries. When I went to pick it up, the bottom of the sandwich was soaking wet and felt like a wet sponge. My fries were cold and tasted like they had been sitting out for a long period of time. My husbands order, which was eggs, English muffin and potatoes- was also cold, and his English muffin was hard as a rock, and didn't come with anything to go on it (no butter of jam) when our server passed by our table, we had him come over and look at our food. At this point, we didn't want to send it back and have it remade or anything. We were upset, we were hungry, and we just wanted to get the hell out of there. The manager came over and said he would take care of our bill... Thanks. We wouldn't have paid for it anyway. They could have made up for us and given us a gift card, and told us to come back so they could make it up to us... But they didn't. This was a terrible experience and I can say, that we won't ever be going back to this location."
Cecil P.,"San Ramon, CA",23,48,13,2.0,3/25/2016,"I'm it sure I get this place. The food is not great, it's loud with long waits. It's basically a big chain, but they are always packed so what do I know. Apparently, not much!"
B S.,"Pleasanton, CA",0,3,,1.0,11/12/2016,"I decided to just place an order for pick because I know we will wait for a while if we eat in. I placed the order at 1 pm, they said it will be ready in 30 mins, we were at the curbside pick up in 45 mins, we still waited a while, it took 3 phone calls for them to finally come out and bring our order out and another 10 mins to give us our receipt."
Phat T.,"Hayward, CA",0,4,3,5.0,8/7/2015,"Love this place. Even for a big chain restaurant, they are on point on food and their cheesecake. Me and my wife has to drive about 20-25 mins to get here but we always enjoy ourselves.  I always get the same thing : the Buffalo Wings app with the sauce on the side to keep the chicken crispy. The chicken is always a good portion. Main dish for me is the Cuban sandwich. Yes, I said sandwich !! With pork, ham, Swiss cheese, mustard and mayonnaise on a grilled roll you can't go wrong. Always end thing with the Reese Peanut Butter cheesecake !!! LOVE THIS PLACE !!"
Brit B.,"San Leandro, CA",3,54,5,1.0,7/21/2016,horrible service called two hours in advance and when i came they were 30 minutes past the pickup time.. jennifer is the manager she didnt show much concern.. another customer was in the middle of complaining as i was picking up my order.. marco *the manager* cleared the tab but nothing about being late and possibly losing my job can make up for thisb
Kim R.,"Pleasanton, CA",59,67,161,2.0,11/26/2013,"I've continued to eat at The Cheesecake Factory since I became gluten-free seven  years ago. I have found that if I stick to fairly simple meals (plain salmon, brown rice and steamed veggies), most restaurants can handle it (most....is the key word). I have never once became sick at the Cheesecake Factory after eating the plain salmon meal. So, I was very intrigued when I saw that they now have an official gluten-free menu. Needless to say, I rushed over. How exciting! It's a totally independent menu. Nice! There were many of their older dishes on this new GF menu which must have been naturally gluten-free to begin with. The new items that jumped out at me were the gluten-free hamburger buns and gluten-free pasta. Of course, I had a bunch of questions to ask. I've listed them below with my waiter's response. Do you use dedicated oil for the French fries listed on your gluten-free menu? No. I then went on to ask why they would go through the effort of introducing this menu without doing it correctly. Despite my attack on their procedure, he was very nice and was eager to learn and help me. Do you use dedicated water for your GF pasta? Yes (continue reading for the real deal on this). What is the flour blend for the pasta? I don't know but I will bring you the package. It turns out is Heartland brand which is a rice and corn blend. What is the brand of your GF hamburger buns? I'm not sure but I'll check....(later) It's Udi's. Are your salad dressing gluten-free? Most of them (so please ask when ordering). Do you use GF blue cheese? (The manager came over to answer this one)...Yes. Do you have GF beer? No, but we do have Angry Orchard Hard Cider (YUM) I notice your Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake is gluten-free. Has it always been gluten-free? No...we were told it was in the past but then we discovered there was gluten (wheat flour) in the crust (SCARY). It has now been revamped to be gluten-free. I decided to try something new to me so I ordered the pear and candied pecan salad with goat cheese (below). This has been on the original menu for some time. Much to my dismay when I got home and served Sammy some pasta, look what I found (see photo I have included)...I have to assume this is a wheat flour noodle since they mentioned nothing of a second type of GF pasta. Since they told me they use dedicated GF pasta water, I am assuming this came from a shared colander or they do not indeed use dedicated water...either way, this was a serious mistake. I absolutely would not consider the GF pasta here at The Cheesecake Factory a ""celiac friendly"" meal or for anyone else eating GF for that matter. It also makes me wonder about their other GF procedures as well. Of course, I had to try the GF Godiva chocolate cheesecake for dessert even though it has dairy. I had only a few bites (scrapping away the whipped cream) and it was chocolate heaven...cheesecake is something they do well. Will I be back? Yes, on occasion I will go back when my older kids want to go. I will order my usual, plain salmon with brown rice and veggies. I will have Sammy order the hamburger since there are probably fewer ways to mess that up. So for me, nothing has changed at The Cheesecake Factory. For Sammy, well, now he gets to have a bun with his hamburger. It's really not a big thrill for him since he's been raised since two years old to just eat the meat of the hamburger. I'm sad that yet another major restaurant chain has jumped on the gluten-free bandwagon without doing their research and training both the kitchen and wait staff properly. I'm hoping there will be enough complaints that they will correct this. This restaurant review gets a ""thumbs down."""
Alicia C.,"Hayward, CA",1,16,,2.0,7/31/2015,"Let me start off saying I have ate here SEVERAL times and always satisfied. We decided to do a lunch order with the office today. We chose to do the curb side pick up. We placed the order at 10:55 am the gentleman was polite and informed me they open at 11 so our order would go right in. He said it would be ready by 11:20. I called back in at 11:02 to add a few more items to the order. Monica answered and said she had to connect me to the bakery? I sat on hold for ten minutes. I placed the call on hold and called back and another gal answered who took my updated order and said it would all be ready in ten minutes. We left and arrived to curb side pick up by 11:25. There is 3 designated spots for pick up and they were all taken by cars that were not using curb side pick up. We sat in the handicap spot thinking it would be a quick turn around. Instead we found ourselves waiting for 20 minutes in our car, several attempts to call the restaurant only lead to minute long rings before an answer to either put me on hold or say it was on its way out. Each call they acted like this was brand new, news that we were outside. There was also another gentleman who arrived 2 minutes after us going through the same thing making the same amount of calls. Finally I asked for the manager which was as useless as my other calls. He said HE would be out in less than a minute with our food. Of course that was not the case. I ended up walking into the restraunt my self. I finally got my order and was expressing my dissatisfaction to the manger and he honestly could have cared less. He said what did I want them to do, our food was hot and that they had a huge catering order today. I explained that was an excuse and did not make me feel any better. They are the ones who gave us our pick up time not me. I shouldn't be sitting in a car in a parking lot for 20+ minutes waiting for my food that should have been ready a long time ago. The curb side pick up sign says MAXIMUM TEN MINUTES PARKING so what happens when the restaurant takes longer? Shouldn't there have been an accommodations an apology a discount? According to this place NO.  They had several opportunities to make this situation right every phone call saying I was outside someone could have be honest and said it was still cooking. I will not be ordering from here again and to top it off my most favorite dish Chicken and Biscuits was horribly greasy and the last time I ate it I dont recall it being a greasy meal :( I would suggest ordering else where. Waste of time energy and money for a company who could give two craps about you."
Jen S.,"Dublin, CA",0,4,,1.0,11/5/2016,"Terrible experience at Cheesecake Factory in Pleasanton. Took 45 mins to get food & we had a baby waiting for food!!! 2 steak tacos orders & a kids grilled cheese! Hostesses were very rude & Manager was condescending. Said he would give us free cheesecake slice but we didn't have time bc lunch took too long. Then gave us a check without taking anything off of check. Finally, we asked if they would take 1 of the meals off since we can't stay for the cheesecake and they did. Shouldn't have had to ask. Waitresses were very friendly."
John M.,"Dublin, CA",0,11,23,1.0,11/5/2016,"This location has consistently poor quality food preparation.  I've complained a few times about this specific location and say I'm not likely to go back, but my wife and I both really enjoy this franchise so we inevitably break down and try it again.  Last night we had dinner and my wife's dish was delivered ice cold and the sauce was water thin rather than the expected consistency of gravy.  My dish was luke warm but we waited so long I ate it anyway.  We spoke to the assistant manager Marco again as we did last time.  He reimbursed us for my wife's dish but it's of no help.  He admitted they have some issues but after this many complaints and no change I give up.  People either don't care or are incapable of meeting reasonable standards for this price level restaurant.  NEVER again, ever."
Sun B.,"Dublin, CA",32,108,65,5.0,1/25/2016,"This is a typical American restaurant  -  where service is shoddy, but people still visit because of giant food portions. We love their food and I think,  giving them 5 stars is fair enough.  We eat here on weekday nights, get the leftovers boxed up and don't have to cook at home for the next 3-4 days.  We are always treated well here and keep coming back. Since their portions are so huge,  the food last a bunch of days and we love that!   I don't understand why this restaurant is rated so low. 3 stars total?  C'mon people!  It seems most of the reviewers giving bad ratings are like  -  ""To one who strikes you on the cheek, offer the other also"" and that doesn't work everywhere because businesses are built on customer service,  it's a given.  If not, then they should be shut down.  But Cheesecake Factory,  which apparently people feel provides awful service,  has been doing that for decades and is still surviving because everyone has put up with it. Why? Because of the extremely low standards of customer service that folks have in the United States.  Raise your standards to how you should be treated and then maybe restaurants like this won't exist. For now, it does exist and no wonder only in United States can it exist. This restaurant won't survive or do that well in Europe as a matter of fact,  but anyways,  that's not the point.  Everyone knows that this is a lousy restaurant. That's a given at any American restaurant after 1906. We are not living in those times anymore.  I have got tips for people who WANT to get a good service out of the staff working here: First, order take out only (problem solved, yay!) Second, if you can't order takeout and HAVE to dine here, then you can utilize the following rules: 1) Give giant big smiles to the staff working here, just like their giant food portions. 2) Greet your server like you are meeting them after 10 long years! 3)  Keep praising the food so loud that every server passing by can hear you The staff here are not paid well at all,  so it is pretty common for employees at places like these to provide ghastly customer service.  The staff feel the need to take it out on the 'vulnerable customer' rather than having a spine and standing up to the 'company management / owner' who exploits them by paying them so low in the first place.  However, in spite of that, there are ways in which you can get a good service out of the staff (see above). Pretty often, the server will forget to bring your second course. Worry not, go up to the counter and say ""I am dying to have the second course, it is sooooo yummy! Oh my gosh I cannot wait!"".  The server will automatically either apologize or give you a serious look and say  ""I will go check if your food is ready and bring it out"".  The food is usually always ready but that's their standard excuse, don't feel upset.  If you are done eating and want to get out of here as fast as possible,  then just go up to the counter again and politely ask for the check. And voila you are done!  Just play by the above rules if you have to eat here and everything will be splendid!"
