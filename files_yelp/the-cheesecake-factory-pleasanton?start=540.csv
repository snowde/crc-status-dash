Yi W.,"Fremont, CA",0,8,8,4.0,7/24/2015,"Cheesecakes are amazing. We got to the restaurant around 11:20. There was a 10 minute wait, which wasn't bad.  Our waiter was great. The place was a bit noisy. The pasta definitely made it up for the noise level. We ordered a bunch of cheesecakes to go. The bill for the three of us was almost 200. Definitely recommend this place."
Ahmed A.,"Dublin, CA",2,6,,1.0,4/17/2016,We went to cheese cake factory today and experience was horrible. There were many problems from the get go.  1) we had called before hand to check for pizza dough and kitchen confirmed that they had it. Once we ordered it they were out. This is the third time this has happened!! 2) the bread served was stale and cold.  3) no straws served with water..  We are never planning to go there ever again..   Terrible!! FYI Also if the order is less than $20 then kids will not get pizza. Highly not recommended for kids
kashmita p.,"Hayward, CA",1,9,5,3.0,4/15/2016,"Only like to eat their cheesecake. Food is okay but it takes a while to get what you ordered. Don't ever go during the big holidays like mothers day, valentine's day etc. because you will be waiting forever for a table."
Brian M.,"Rocklin, CA",49,69,2,1.0,11/25/2015,"normally enjoy this spot however a month or two ago, killed that idea. called to give input and was told we would get a callback after they verify and check the receipts.  no call back almost 60 days later.  undercooked chicken and was sick for almost two days straight."
Khal A.,"Fremont, CA",14,7,,1.0,10/16/2015,"WORST EXPERIENCE EVER... Thursday nights are our ladies night. It's a night were we are away from our work, children, and responsibilities.  Somehow for the last 3 Thursday's we have ended up at The Cheesecake Factory at Stoneridge Mall. Well tonight was one to go on the records for the worst dinner ever!! After I told our waiter that my pasta was uncooked, the manager Will West came to our table only to argue with me and tell me the pasta's are all al dente! Going back and forth finally he took it back and brought it back again without the sauce and the only vegetable I had asked for. No one checked on us for another 30 minutes. Meanwhile, we were informed that one of our other entree were given to another table in error. So at this point we only had 3/5 entrees and we had been there for over 2 hours now! Too late for our movie  we were suppose to watch, Mr. West comes back after I asked for him from 2 waiters and argues with me for about 5 minutes. I was literally speechless. Finally, a second manager approaches our table. At least this managers was sympathetic towards our feelings and the time we had wasted waiting around for dinner. I have never had a restaurant make so many errors and then argue with the customer as to why I should just eat it. At last our 5th entree was brought and they informed us that they forgot to put in the order after being reminded 4 times. Cheesecake please train your managers on customer service! Shame on you Will West, shame on you!"
M N.,"Antioch, CA",254,135,178,3.0,12/1/2014,"Just like all the Cheesecake Factory Restaurants. Food was great we had: Appetizer: Fried Calamari was not crispy enough, batter was soggy and it fell apart Entree:  *Caesar Salad was perfect *Kobe Burger was told the biggest Burger it     was an amazing burger. *Smokehouse BBQ Burger i had a taste it was also pretty good.  I give this location 3 stars. 1 star for great server, another for how quick the food was made and 1 more for great food. 2 stars knocked off because of how horrible the timing is when it comes to seating everyone. Our Pager never went off, they said 30 minutes. After 30 minutes I informed them that it has been longer than 30 minutes they made us wait another 10. We ended up waiting for an hour. One of the hostess told me she was going to get water for someone on our party. She never came back that person was coughing bad. Front desk needs to stop chatting with the rest of staff that are on a break."
Judy W.,"Oakland, CA",412,343,133,3.0,7/23/2013,"the only reasons I want to go to Cheesecake factory is because of the following: Brown Bread, Herb crusted salmon, red velvet cheesecake. The reasons why i don't come here often is because: Not so awesome service long waits overpriced mediocre food too loud to have a private conversation dirty utensils However, when i am able to make myself ignore those cons, the pro's make me happy lol. I LOVE the bread. and cheesecake is to die for...  Definitely not a place I will go to often, but will stop by then i have about 30 bucks extra to spend... =]"
nanu b.,"Sunnyvale, CA",17,96,4,2.0,10/19/2014,"Went there for the 1st time n had an unappetizing experience. Food- one word terrible! Ordered the dynamite shrimp. Was expecting lightly crispy shrimp with a spicy sauce. What I got was super oily shrimp with an aioli that was neither dynamite nor spectacular. There was no spice at all. Felt like I had a bad version of fish n chips. Was queasy when I reached home with all that dirty oil. Pasta da Vinci- very al dente pasta with non existent mushrooms n chicken. Sauce was good but sweet,could use salt n other seasonings. Pizza florentina- very salty. Again patches of chicken n other toppings n heavy on cheese. Really thick n soft crust which I dislike. I was cursing myself for choosing to go there. CPK is better although still mediocre. Jennifer our waitress was our only shining light through the hopeless culinary experience.   Don't know how people rave about this place. Never again!"
Marlene L.,"San Jose, CA",20,108,70,2.0,11/11/2013,"Went on a Sunday, a table for two would be 50 mins. ummmm, ok because I drove from San Jose to meet up with a friend coming from Vallejo beggars can't be choosers. We ordered drinks at the bar and talked, our buzzard still hadn't gone off and we were pushing an hour and a half. I ask the girls at the front desk what happened and she said she called my name...why did u give me a buzzard if it's not going to go off?!?! -_- Then she asked if I still wanted a table...I'm standing here asking you about it, aren't I?  They ran out of butter....weird. I had a great waiter though!"
Joseph H.,"Ceres, CA",14,20,20,5.0,4/11/2015,"There are a few times that we get to come to Cheesecake Factory and today was the day. It was perfect. Patio seating, Ashley was our waitress and she was beyond perfect. Loved the customer service Ashley gave us, but the host at the counter was beyond rude. Ashley made up for it though. Overall it was great."
Mr. Putt P.,"Livermore, CA",0,52,,1.0,12/31/2014,"I'd give it 1/2 star only if I can. Food was slightly warm last we ate here, and it took forever to get the check.  Now for to go (cheesecake), I walked out the last 2 times, today being one of them that drove to finally creating this review. This is probably the poorest run joint or one of them down there for to go area. There is no numbering system to help people and designate who's waiting to order vs. lounging around. There was only 1 cashier working and she rather deal with the phones and I was 3rd in line, only to find out I'm supposed to go to the neighboring cashier even if there was no one there.  I reached out to someone who said ""yes, this cashier is to order"" only to hear right after ""i'm going on my break"".  I walked out after that and many people behind me were very disgruntled with even the line for pickup with the gal preferring to deal with  the phones rather than the customers right in front of her. I think some of them were also wondering if they can order because there was only one person manning the cash register."
Rossi K.,"San Francisco, CA",79,95,,2.0,2/21/2016,"Came here for lunch today and they messed up on our order. My wife asked for her burger well done and mayo on the side. The burger came out medium and our server totally forgot about the mayo. We asked for the burger to be cooked again, which they complied (again, no mayo on the side) but the overall experience along with the subpar food and slow service (server never asked if we wanted water refilled) was something we should have expected since this was not the first time we've experienced this kind of poor customer service at this location nor will it be the last time, unfortunately. The Union Square location is much better imo."
Coreen M.,"San Ramon, CA",18,92,50,1.0,2/5/2016,"Got food to go twice now from here and both times said our bread was in the bag and get home it is not there. Side note - the pasta was very under cooked and dry, yuck! I just talked to the manager and she could care less."
J C.,"San Ramon, CA",114,29,19,4.0,10/3/2015,We order  Grilled Chicken  with mashed potatoes and large spears of asparagus. The Chicken is cooked to perfection.  The  food are consistent good every time we were here.  We had a wonderful server and amazing food.
Edwin R.,"San Mateo, CA",140,972,8244,3.0,8/23/2013,"You can't go wrong with any of their desserts. They give you huge slices. My favorite so far is their Mango Key Lime Cheesecake. Food wise - it's just okay. I think people come here for the ambiance and for the convenience. If you ask me, it's a bit overrated. Service is okay too. Sometimes very slow depends which location you're at. It's packed during lunch hours. It's pricey and a casual lunch for two expect to pay well over $40 with tip easily. I have dined in at several locations with Cheesecake Factory. My favorite so far I would say would have to be in Woodland Hills. It has that community flair to it and not so much touristy."
Patricia G.,"Pleasanton, CA",17,29,8,1.0,8/20/2016,"There is a reason why this has such low stars - Marco Vargas, manager does not understand restaurant management or service recovery. After being told the outside is not open and waiting 40 minutes with an empty outside while watching several parties be seated outside after we were wary. When it took the bar 15 minutes to deliver drinks. The waitress was sweet but helpless to fix things. Very straightforward order and my husband's meal was never put in and so he went without. We call Marco over to address and he comps us our meals that we didn't get to eat together. We told him were were disappointed he didn't comp our dinner as it was a fiasco from the start and he said he could only comp food. I shared with him out displeasure and he was unmoved to perform adequate service recovery. Maybe it doesn't matter to the corporate Cheesecake Factory people - but we are done with ANY Cheesecake Factory entity in any state. Completely disappointed. Don't bother to come here. Many better restaurants in town. Saw Marco having to visit with several tables. Obviously a mismanaged restaurant. He actually told us it was illegal to comp us our drinks. Completely untrue. Mismanaged and misinformed."
Alyssa S.,"Concord, CA",0,23,15,2.0,2/28/2016,"After noticing dirty silverware  on our table I let the hostess know and she said that there wasn't any more silverware available and she took our silverware and put it back in the drawer to serve to other guests!! I then told her that I noticed that she did that and she shrugged her shoulders and told me that she's ""only the hostess"". Oh my!! If that's what we see in front of us I wonder what we miss in the kitchen. The manager was shocked and appalled batter he heard  the news but in any case management needs to tighten up."
S L.,"Oakland, CA",66,374,445,2.0,10/18/2015,"Seriously, it gets too crowded here. The wait is outrageous. There were so many people that they ran out of their buzzers. For 2 people, we had to wait an hour and a half.  However, the hostesses were as organized as they can be and they treated everyone nicely. They had to deal with a lot of pressure and they did not break. Food has  always  been just okay for me. My friend and I  shared the tex mex eggrolls, cajun shrimp pasta and strawberry cheesecake. Our server was too busy with a table that had a large group so someone else helped us.  They got our pasta order wrong but changed it for us immediately.  Gets too crazy, stay away during weekends."
Grant K.,"Pleasanton, CA",0,6,,2.0,10/16/2016,"Disappointing.  Ordered Shrimp And Angel Hair; shrimp was very overcooked, sauce was somehow dry, portion was tiny.  If it weren't for the cheesecakes still being all right, this would be one star."
Koushik G.,"Pleasanton, CA",0,9,1,2.0,3/28/2016,"Had to literally ask for a fork and spoon. Waiter is extremely rude, didn't want to take the full order. Overall horrible service."
