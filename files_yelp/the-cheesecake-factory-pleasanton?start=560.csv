DC C.,"Sunnyvale, CA",216,75,29,1.0,10/2/2014,Not happy with my drink . Cadallic Margarita includes a shot of grand mariner .  Not here Step 4 Measure a shot of Grand Mariner or Cointreau and add it to the margarita glass.
Kaisu C.,"Allston/Brighton, Boston, MA",0,2,,1.0,3/25/2016,"It's not about the food and it's all about the service. They gave us a smaller cake with two layer (more than any normal time) and we ask for another one. A waiter said he will go get another one from the back and we stranded there for more than 20 mins waiting for the cake. The manager showed up asking if we need help, we told him we are waiting for the cake. Guess what, he said we can't get you another cake to replace and he said the waiter who talked to me earlier actually serving other tables. So what's the point asking me standing there and wait. So rude, will never ever going back. Definitely find another place to get my cake next time."
Aya M.,"Dublin, CA",5,43,,1.0,8/14/2016,"We placed a Pickup order for lunch and we were told it would be ready in 20-25 mins.  Went to pick up the food 25 mins later and waited an additional 20 minutes to receive our lunch.   We then brought it home and everything we ordered was cold - all 5 orders. 61$ in a Pickup order and it was useless.  I then called and asked I speak to a manager and he stated that he is unable to refund our order due to the fact it was paid by a gift card.   Interesting that they can take the cheesecake gift card but can't give you one back or give you credit for the restaurant.   The manager then mentioned that he will be out the next couple of days but to bring back the receipt on his return and he could give me a new order.    I shouldn't have to wait for anyone as I am the customer paying for a service, my food was most likely sitting in their windows while I was waiting for 20 mins in the restaurant (which the manager agreed to), and a 61$ Pickup order lunch should not be cold/it shouldn't even been given to me.    Even the managements corrective action was far from decent - I really feel like we got ripped off!"
Neha B.,"Dublin, CA",2,40,6,5.0,4/30/2015,"I am a great fan of this place since years. I know, took me very long to finally write a review !!! Well, to start with I would say that the staff is great, they always take a good care of you. They'll come and ask you in between meals if you need anything or u liked the food or not. And for the vegetarians, you can always ask to not have the meat in your dish or u can have it on the side. The place is clean even after so much foot print.  Coming to the food, I love the sweet brown bread they serve. The menu is so big that it sometimes gets little confusing. But the good thing is that you get lots and lots of options.  The tomato basil pasta, four cheese pasta, stuffed mushrooms, shrimp , Jamaican shrimp and chicken, Cajun chicken( from the special plates menu), all the  cheese cakes are the few things which I really like."
Lance A.,"Merced, CA",0,19,14,1.0,9/5/2015,"Long waits, slow service, hair ball under the table where we were seated extremely dirty floors, and utensils were stained and dirty from not being washed properly. Requested new silverware and it was the same have eaten at many cheese cake factory establishments none like this one. One star for the cheese cake the rest is in unsatisfactory"
Sarah B.,"New York, NY",0,14,5,1.0,9/27/2015,"Last night I witnessed the manager of the restaurant arguing with two different parties. She was flailing her hands, raising her tone, and snappy. It was completely unprofessional. What kind of established food chain allows this type of behavior? It was so appalling to watch. I've never seen something handled so poorly by a manager in my life."
Laurina S.,"Dublin, CA",201,277,389,4.0,2/8/2016,The CheeseCake Factory is one of my favorite chain restaurants. The small plates are great and the happy hour used to be killer. Please bring back the old happy hour deals and turn the lights on.
Joey J.,"Livermore, CA",0,36,,1.0,9/20/2016,"Follow up Review:  This review is about the horrible Fish & Chips. I started going back to this location, on cause the waitress there that helps me is really good at her job. When I go into CF, I always get the same thing. This time I wanted to try something else.( Big Mistake ) I tried the Fish & Chips! I was pumped when it came out. It looked great! I soon come to find out that the fish wasn't cooked right. The small pieces were great, but the big pieces were mushy & falling apart. I couldn't tell if it was under cooked or old. I'm very, very disappointed in CF for this. love this place! What's not to love? The only problem is the service is very inconsistent. Sometimes I come in and the service is top notch. You never have to ask for refills, they bring bread right to your table, they seem genuinely happy that you sat in there section. But today was the total oppose of good customer service. I sat down in what looked to be a slow section, so I was very surprised that it took my waitress quite awhile to greet me and ask what I would like to drink. She then brought my drink over and then took off without asking me if I was ready to order. She then came back ask me for my order then took off. Never refilling my drink or bring over any bread. It's not really a big deal, but when I go out to eat, I want it to be a smooth transition. I don't want to have to ask for anything. Just for the record, this was durning the off hours, around 2:15 in the afternoon.  Anyways, my meal finally came and it was great. The food is always great at Cheesecake, yet their service is going down hill and fast.  When I returned to work, I shared my experience with a few of my co workers and they confirmed that the service isn't very desirable.  By the way, I was thinking of putting the waitress name, but I don't think that would be right."
Rhonda A.,"Pleasanton, CA",20,8,1,1.0,4/8/2016,"***Update***: My Husband had the steak for his meal and since about 11 pm last night he has been vomiting ... He might have food poisoning... Now I have to deal with not only being grossed out but now have to clean up vomit ... All for the price for about 50 dollars plus a 20 dollar tip ... Thanks Cheesecake Factory... You have made the last day of my life horrible !!!!   Ah man , I hate that I have to give one star on a review, and it is was not due to bad service... It was the quality of food and my least favorite thing that came to my table ... a drink with someone else lip imprints in hot pink.  I had ordered my first drink (Georgia Peach Daiquiri) and it tasted like a glass of virgin drink without any alcohol in it, so I sent it back and ordered a chocolate martini ... only to receive it and after my first drink , I noticed that there was a greasy film on top, so I just happen to look at the rim of the glass only to find lip imprints in a nice hot pink color, I almost threw up right then and there, and rather than do that, I just kinda burst into tears. Our server was great and the manager came over to apologize and compt the used glass garbage drink along with the appetizer that I was trying to eat before I discovered someone else DNA all over my drink that I had taken a sip of... I can honestly say I will not be going back to TCF ever, as I am permanently grossed out ...  UHHH VOMIT !!!!!"
Tanzeem K.,"Union City, CA",4,16,4,4.0,10/12/2015,Cheesecake is a great place. They have lots of food you can order from. But there service isn't too great. Waiters are so rude now days I don't know why or if they don't want tips but they must change their attitude. The food is amazing the cheese cake is amazing but the waiters aren't. Please change the way they talk to customers.
Debbie D.,"Dublin, CA",178,17,3,3.0,4/21/2016,"Hit or miss. It's a chain and everyone has a Gift Certificate so the wait is always long. Food is okay. It will never have the ""Oh my god' this is heavenly!"" Type of review. Just okay - sometimes less than that."
Britni C.,"Pleasanton, CA",8,2,,1.0,3/25/2015,"This place sucks. It is overrated and here is why:    1. Wait is long but that was a given, being an over rated place.   2. When we were finally seated the waitress never picked up the check from the previous customer, so my man & I were busy staring at the check book with tip inside uncomfortably.   3. After 20mins of just sitting there the waitress finally came picked up her tip then got our order.    4. 15mins after that we finally get our bread and his water (not mine) didn't realize only one showed up to the dinner table I guess.   5. Waitress came to our table 3 times before we finally so a dinner plate that was not taken correctly because we asked for it to be split (better portion control reasons). Not once did Johnie offer to refill the bread, water or get me another glass of wine. (All drinks were dry) If I have to go into what looks like a high end restaurant and tell them how to serve me. It is not worth the money or patience.  Go to lazy dogs. Long wait but excellent service. This is why the server was left with no tip and a bad review on their company. Get it together."
Loreto D.,"Fremont, CA",209,208,1081,4.0,12/27/2013,Not sure why this place has low reviews because I think it's pretty decent.  I came here earlier today for lunch and ordered the miso salmon which I really liked. The ambiance is nice in there as well. I love how they provide yourl warm baked bread. I always request the whole wheat bread and I even like the taste of that. I can seriously go there just to snack on their bread and butter.  I'm typically not a huge fan of cheesecake but their godiva cheesecake is just grand! I would totally come back here.
Ryan A.,"Hayward, CA",154,380,169,3.0,12/21/2013,"We ate here last night.  Party of 7, 4 adults, 3 kids.  The food was pretty good.  I had Chicken Madeira/Steak Diane.  I would order something different next time.  My steak was pretty tough, although the server didn't exactly know what cut of beef the Steak Diane was, it's on me for still going forward with my order knowing that.  The mash potatoes were pretty hard.  I did like the chicken, sweet sauce the meal was on & the mushrooms as well.   We had the avocado egg rolls for appetizer as well. Those were good.  They came with this sweet tasting type of pesto/oil sauce.  It was a nice touch.  I also ordered a salad.  That tasted pretty good as well. Last was the cheesecake of course.  Their chessecakes are excellent.  Big portions, great taste.  I ordered mine to go as I was too full to eat it last night, but I will dust it tonight."
Mandy C.,"Burlingame, CA",13,2,,1.0,4/9/2015,"If I could have given this a negative star I would. We ordered the chicken wings and to our displeasure we were fed RAW,UNCOOKED,PINK CHICKEN WINGS. The manger seemed very uninterested and didn't ofer any solution other than asking us if we wanted to order more. When we asked if we could have a complimentary appetizer she said, ""I'll see what I can do.""  I feel like this is not the correct why to handle a raw dish being served to their dinner guests; especially people that have not ate at your restaurant. Will not ever go again!"
Tiff C.,"San Francisco, CA",1132,1047,1737,2.0,8/6/2014,I don't know what's been going on with the last few cheesecake factories that I've been to within the past few years but the pasta has been hard and not cooked enough. The lunch portions are a good size for a good price though and the rest of the regular menu has huge portions. Cheesecake is a good place for variety.
Nabil A.,"San Ramon, CA",4,8,1,1.0,2/22/2016,"How is this place still in business?  Every time I've ever had the displeasure of dining at The Cheesecake Factory I've felt cheated. It's like being in an abusive relationship. I think to myself, ""Maybe this is the time that they'll get it together?"" But no. It never works out. My most recent visit is what brought me to air out my feelings via Yelp. Some friends and I agreed to meet for dinner there on a Sunday evening, expecting it to be crowded. No problem. We arrive and are greeted with a ""1-2 hour wait"" which is reasonable. We notice there are some adjacent tables at the bar so we decided to camp out until we could create a tic-tac-toe of seating to fit everyone.  Eventually we were able to accomplish this and let the servers know we would happily take separate checks if necessary, we just wanted to sit together. They provide us menus and let us know they would be with us shortly to take our drink orders. However, I was unprepared for the ensuing game of hide and go seek I was in for after our waitress disappeared for 30 minutes.  Fortunately, I was able to find our mythical waitress. She apologized profusely and took our drink order of some diet cokes, a few cocktails, and mostly waters. This seemed straight forward to me but 25 minutes later when I received my cocktail the ice cubes were former shells of themselves.  This was only the beginning, however. Shortly thereafter we were notified that they were unable to make my girlfriend's food as they were out of flatbread. This information would've been valuable much earlier but I digress. The manager gave a quick mutter of an apology and let her know he would be back with a menu shortly. Little did I know that the manager must hold down a part time job as a magician, as his disappearing act was phenomenal.   I once again was able to corral a waitress back over to our table to get a menu. She took the order and assured us it would be ready 'on the fly.' I was skeptical. I was proven wrong once the food arrived 15 minutes. Or so I thought. The pasta had a texture similar to that of a rubber band.  Once we received the bill, I asked the waitress to comp the pasta. Not the entire meal, our drinks, or appetizers. Just the $16 bowl of pasta. This resulted in an overly generous $10. Who needs to win the Powerball when Cheesecake is giving out that kind cash? I paid the bill and left. I won't be back."
Judy L.,"Dublin, CA",487,660,4524,3.0,12/3/2013,"The menu is stimulus overload, and dangerous for people with ADD. I'll visit this restaurant to get my cheesecake to go because if dinner AND a cheesecake is involved, I would be one rotund human being.  The banana cream cheesecake is sooo yummy... must try!"
Lincy H.,"Union City, CA",1463,550,925,4.0,3/26/2013,"The Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite restaurants. I don't think I've ever had a bad experience, and I've always been satisfied with my entrees. I came here with my girls last night. Service was great! Our waitress was super sweet, and the waits (to get seated, food, the bill) weren't long at all. I will always love their complimentary bottomless bread, NOM NOM NOM! My bff and I shared the chicken bellagio and the chopped salad. I absolutely loved the chicken bellagio, but make sure you don't finish it on your own. That thing alone is 2000 calories! LOL. The chopped salad was good for the most part, but the bleu cheese was a bit too strong for me. As for drinks, I got the Georgia Peach. It was really really sweet. I think I'll just stick with my factory peach bellini for next time :P We were too stuffed to get cheesecake. Plus, I need to lose weight, looool. They pack your food for you :D Great for lazy people like me, hehehe."
Thee M.,"Oakland, CA",2,47,13,1.0,12/12/2015,"Well I wish I had a better review but I don't think I'll go back. This was my first time going to Pleasanton period and this location. We got there shortly after opening and had a 20-30 minute wait which was fine. After we were seated, we noticed one small plate was dirty, as we checked the rest we found those were ALSO dirty. Our utensils were dirty too, food was on the forks & I was ready to go then! But we were a party of 9 so I had to stay. We sat at the table for an entire hour with our waters and lemonades before we ever got food. Once the food came out, mine was wrong! The waitress was very kind though, offered me a complimentary salad or soup and was very apologetic which I loved. There were some good and bad things about this location but I think I'll go back to the a Walnut Creek location."
