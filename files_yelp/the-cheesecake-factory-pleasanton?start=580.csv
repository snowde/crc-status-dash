Blaire A.,"Union City, CA",57,113,72,4.0,1/23/2014,"Red velvet cheesecake is always my favorite and is to die for. I have a problem with how expensive their cheesecakes are though. You may get a decent sized slice but 8 bucks for a slice is super expensive when I could go to the grocery store and get a whole cheesecake for the same price. The price does not deter me, only in the sense that I do not go very often as much as I'd love to. I do not like their calamari. Their sweet potato fries are delicious. Macaroni balls (appetizer) were really good but overpriced for only get four of them. The strawberry lemonade was definitely good. I highly recommend the Banana, Peanut Butter, honey and _____ milkshake (don't remember the rest of the name). This milk tastes like a PB and Banana sandwich and if that grosses you out, it really shouldn't. It was sooo good, I walked away feeling like a happy fatty! :] The wait at this restaurant is always ridiculous and I wish they would take reservations so I don't have to stand around for an hour for a darn seat!  My servers have always been nice and patient with me."
Zozo Z.,"East Oakland, Oakland, CA",1,8,7,1.0,10/4/2015,Today I ordered pasta with shrimp and sausage . The dish was good and tasty. But shrimps are Raw and Uncooked . We have asked the waiter . He provided really bad customer service and charged my dish. This place is awful . Watch out if you order seafood dishes. Shrimp may not be well cooked. I pay $$$ for well cooked delicious food. This place is not sushi restaurant . You guy are supposed to serve well cooked dishes . I have really bad experience. It's so disappointed !!!
David T.,"Chicago, IL",0,7,,4.0,9/25/2016,The wait was around a hour and half. The Bartenders are excellent. Once we got seated Mason was a great server. The food was pretty darn good. I had the California cheese steak sandwich very good a little small . The cheesecake was really good. I would recommend eating at the bar.
Sara H.,"Modesto, CA",46,1,,1.0,2/17/2016,"The worst restaurant experience I've ever had- waited for 2 hours to be seated. We ordered all meals at the same time but were served at different times- except 2 meals that were delivered after everyone was done, and 2 never came, 2 hours after waiting from the Time we placed the order-we had them boxed up to go. of the meals that were delivered- one was burned and inedible, and one was under cooked. No refills on drinks, or wrong drinks, and the waitress seemed bother when we asked for salad dressing that was ordered on the side- won't go back"
Bridget O.,"San Ramon, CA",1,12,5,1.0,12/3/2015,"Usually I enjoy going to the Cheesecake Factory, not tonight. I ordered the garlic noodles with chicken. I had meat on bones in my pasta. I asked the server about it, he came back from the kitchen and said it wasn't a mistake, the bones add more flavor. I don't want to pay extra for chicken with bones in it. Fail Cheesecake Factory. Not going to be returning anytime soon."
Esther Y.,"Emeryville, CA",611,1589,1568,4.0,3/31/2013,"The only bad thing about Cheesecake Factory anywhere is the super long wait. Arriving at 5:30 pm on Saturday will still garner at least a 40 minute wait. Crazy! Service is friendly and great here, the complimentary rye bread is one of the best appetizer breads at any restaurant, the menu is surely extensive enough for even the pickiest of eaters, and of course, there is definitely an extensive menu of desserts/cheesecake. Be sure to let foreigners know that the Cheesecake Factory does not only sell cheesecake and no, you're not just eating cheesecake for dinner (true story...friend from Germany was very disinterested and unexcited about going to Cheesecake Factory and kept suggesting to go somewhere else...until we forced her to come and showed her the menu, she was shocked). Recommended: avocado eggrolls (appetizer) Evelyn's Favorite Pasta Bistro Shrimp Pasta Shrimp with Angel Hair Grilled Chicken Tostada Salad Key Lime Cheesecake Vanilla Bean Cheesecake Strawberry Cheesecake Oreo Cheesecake I do NOT recommend the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta. There's something offputting about it...perhaps the amount of cream/butter that is used in it? It's also not spicy at all, even though the description says ""very spicy cajun sauce"". Consider SHARING. The portions are ginormous and you're going to want to save room for cheesecake! The prices seem high at first, but when you consider how much you're getting, it's actually quite reasonable. If you share, it's cheap. I shared the grilled chicken tostada salad and cajun jambalaya pasta with 3 people, avocado eggrolls with 5 people, and a vanilla bean cheesecake with 4 people, and my portion of the bill was $20 including tax and tip. Wow, right?"
N H.,"San Francisco, CA",0,7,,1.0,8/15/2016,Not only was I on hold for 20 minutes waiting to place my pick-up order but the food was absolutely disgusting...My 10 year old niece can make better pasta than this...  I will forever only stick to ordering cheesecake.
Cathy S.,"Fairfield, CA",0,13,,1.0,3/21/2016,"Terrible service.  Sunday night, they were packed.  Took 45 mins to be seated, another 20 mins to order, had to repeatedly ask the waiter to do his job. Took way too long to get the food. Pasta was cold.  Too much to mention here.  Waiter had a very bad night! Even asked to speak to a manager, and they didn't show up either!  Poor customer service.  We won't be back!"
Simachya W.,"Richmond, CA",1,4,5,1.0,4/2/2016,"I have been going here to this cheesecake factory for while now and have always  had great service until the last several visits,  we went this past friday and got a first come first serve table in the middle of the restaurant durning happy hour. We were approached by who we thought was out server and out of no where someone else is saying that they're our server,  we asked where the other server was,? The lady had attitude and said nope im taking over ,we didnt like how she had an attitude. We said no we'd like for the previous server to be our server.  She had attitude again. Then the whole night was uncomfortable to where several servers served us and was bad. One lady brought me my food and left without leaving the other playe of food , when we clearly saw it in het hands , she brought it back. And apologized, why did she walk off with tye food. I feel she did something to it before bringing it back. I ordered the 4 cheese pasta gluten free.  With a side of asparagus,  the asparagus was burned, tasted burnt, looked burned and smelled burned . They brough it back steamed . All in all the service was crap,  and when we got our check they over charged for 2 items and brought back 2 receipts that didnt make since , said because one item was for happy hour they couldnt mark it all on one receipt.  Thats crap. It was way over happy hour before we left. They changed the order served us poorly and because of that we didnt tip. I dont tip people if their services arent good . And i am a great tipper. Mighti add i ordered the famous strawberry cheesecake when i got home and had some the strawberry topping tasted like cough syrup. Gross.  If you go here and want a great outstanding server ask for Cameron (hes African American ). Hes always has the best service there which is why we even continue to go to this location. As for the other servers,  get it together.  Love your job or find a new one. Your job is based off of your customers, if you're rude and unpleasant you dont get good feedback or tips. Stay home with the B.S. attitude."
Anna M.,"Fremont, CA",74,40,31,3.0,1/26/2015,Came in on a Monday evening and was instantly seated. Bread came soon after which was all wheat which was allllll good with me! The waiter has been very nice and attentive. I am however done with my appetizer and still waiting on my drink.  Overall way better than the San Jose location.
Steven P.,"Danville, CA",17,260,22,3.0,10/5/2014,Good place to grab a bite to eat. Gets super busy here.  Big menu and some of the nicest staff I ever met at a CCF.  The food is pretty average and the cheesecakes delicious.
Raquel C.,"Concord, CA",2,17,19,1.0,10/13/2014,"Me and my husband went there and got a table. We waited for almost 20 min while being really hungry and thirsty. They didn't even attempt to bring us water...taking our actual food order was obviously a non existent option.  We got up and left. Absolutely bad service, how are they expecting to receive good tips...?"
Vanessa F.,"Livermore, CA",2,17,1,5.0,8/13/2016,"Morgan R is a gem! Crazy packed here tonight (Saturday around 6) and she handled it all at the bakery/to go counter with grace and a smile! You're wonderful, Morgan! Keep it up :)"
Ryan G.,"Redwood City, CA",51,15,15,5.0,11/12/2014,"I am the type of person who really enjoys trying different things,  especially when going out to eat.  With a 20 page menu there is plenty of new selections.   I have tried something different every time I have been to a cheesecake factory,  and the quality has been consistent. It's new it's hip and it's a lot of fun. The service is friendly,  and of course the cheesecake."
Donald G.,"Livermore, CA",0,6,,1.0,4/6/2015,"Horrible experience  I ordered 2 cheesecakes in advance for my wife's birthday. 5 days later, I waited to pick it up and was told they were out of boxes. It was embarrassing to present 2 cakes in cut-up cardboard boxes at a party. As I began to serve, I realized it was not the strawberry cakes I ordered, they were plain cheese cakes with absolutely nothing on top. I will never order there again, it was a $100. bad experience."
Sonia A.,"San Jose, CA",91,103,148,4.0,11/18/2014,"I've been here a few times after work with my coworkers for drinks and appetizers. We have a good time, the service is usually great. Our waitress was amazing last time (I forgot her name), but she was so helpful and accommodating. We had a group of about 7 girls and she was happy to split our bill. She gave us a sample wine tasting to choose from and kept our drinks coming - she took care of us! The only thing I did not like was how the ""manager"" came over to tell us to keep it down. We were in a corner and having fun and honestly we were not that loud. There was a birthday party next to us who was louder than us and we didn't complain. We joined in and even sang Happy Birthday. Did not appreciate that - 2 Stars for Management, 5 Stars for our waitress!!"
Eileen S.,"Hayward, CA",80,89,461,3.0,2/15/2013,"Great place for a party dinner or celebration of any sort. It has a huge variety of tasty foods in large portions at an OK price.  This particular Cheesecake Factory is always packed (Every time I've come, I've had to wait anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour), and they don't always take reservations. The service here is almost always crappy. I've only had one decent waitress. The rest have forgotten orders, been overly 'polite' by constantly interrupting to see if we were enjoying our meal, or just been straight up rude. Being really dimly lit, having noisy pop music no one can hear over everyone's loud conversations, and being able to hear all the noise from the kitchen make for an unpleasant atmosphere. The decor of bright, fancy-looking foreign art (I don't know how else to describe it) tries to fool you into thinking that it's some upscale restaurant, but it's just a franchise that's really nothing more than a glorified/more expensive Applebee's.  The only reason this place is getting three stars is because their food is really good and their overpriced cheesecake is delicious. However, I'd skip coming here if you want to avoid the heart-breaking feeling you'll get after seeing the bill."
Messi G.,"Pleasanton, CA",0,4,1,3.0,3/10/2016,Ok service not too excitement. Slow food service servers are busy with each other. Not too keen on coming back.
Toni E.,"Hayward, CA",0,16,9,1.0,10/16/2015,"Overrated, lunchtime pasta was overcooked, took too long, and bill was wrong. My first time and definitely my last, servers don't know the menu and the food was bland."
Cindy Z.,"San Diego, CA",75,258,77,4.0,10/17/2014,"When there is nothing else in town, you can always count on Cheescake.  They have consistantly good food and only their service is questionable. The menu is full of variety and great value. We love Cheesecake factory and this loocation was OK"
