Amina B.,"Menlo Park, CA",19,5,,5.0,12/10/2017,"I am a regular customer at this restaurant.  I usually love the food, but on December 9th my dinner was not up to my expectation.  I talked to the manager (I forgot his name) and he handled the situation where I was very happy.  I give it a 5 star for the superb customer service I received from the manager."
A R.,"Danville, CA",0,2,,1.0,12/3/2017,This place is a joke. Call ahead to determine wait time and told 20 minutes. Then arrive and told twenty minutes. Then sit for an hour and twenty minutes while managers scurry around like rats afraid to look up and acknowledge their incompetence. Simply state an approximate wait time and allow people to choose. Will not patronize in the future!!!!
Omar R.,"San Lorenzo, CA",64,344,1387,4.0,3/1/2017,"Shopping in the area and felt like  lunch and cheesecake. Great location and a decent stop to take a group or lived one. There's open seating and intimate booths for privacy. Add valet service and you forget you're in the mall.        Great lunch menu and service was great. I opted  for the turkey burger and fries, with my better half trying out the meat loaf. Both dishes were good and saved enough room for dessert. I'm personally not a big fan of meat loaf but tried a bite anyway, gave me that nostalgic home town feeling with creamy mash and veggies. My burger was a hit and definitely curbed my craving for my favorite go to cheat meal without the guilt.        Great entrees and lucky enough to just make room for some white chocolate raspberry cheesecake. To start the rich raspberry flavor was delicious with some great creamy ice cream to top off the meal. The meal was reasonably priced and love the ambiance this restaurant gives."
Mikey P.,"Tracy, CA",4,3,,1.0,11/27/2017,This lady at the checkout was very disrespectful. Not the lady at the front desk but where you pick up orders to go.
Rebecca F.,"Dublin, CA",0,6,2,1.0,12/9/2017,"I paid $14 for an omelette that was supposed to contain two portions of cheese, mushrooms and avocado (which was not included.) All I received was this. I also paid $6 for two bites of spinach. When I spoke with the manager, he defended this order..."
Maryanna G.,"Pleasanton, CA",287,16,18,1.0,9/20/2017,"We have ordered lunch here Various of Times and it never fails....something is always missing or wrong. I ordered a BBQ chicken salad with NO TOMATOES AND EXTRA CHICKEN  and I got 3 pieces of chicken and some tomatoes! And the order was repeated twice! How hard is it to get it right! We ordered a loaf of bread and we get this stale bread wrapped in a little foil that I can literally make crumbs out of. We ordered other dishes and they still failed to put them in the bag. PLEASE GET IT TOGETHER! NEVER ORDERING FROM HERE AGAIN! Stay away from cold, stale and dry food! IT WAS SUCH A waste of money!"
Stephanie F.,"Alameda, CA",0,34,16,1.0,11/24/2017,Ordered the pasta de vinci and it was disgusting! I have ate this at different Cheesecake Factorys and they all tasted great except this one. The chicken was burnt and the whole plate was extremely greasy. There was no sauce just so gross. I am so dissapointed. Never going to this Cheesecake Factory again!
Ecks E.,"Austin, TX",0,259,16,1.0,12/10/2017,"12/10 10:10 am, I came in to pick up my to go order, asked the short very unfriendly Asian girl with glasses, she gave me attitude no eye contact no smiles point to the side and the black chubby lady same - unfriendly no smile looks like have not waked up yet told me order just came in have to wait for while, I am very pleased asked her make sure double check my orders, because been missing lots of times, I am very surprised she answered me back : I don't know other people, but I will check . I won't never ever coming back."
Amy V.,"Oakland, CA",195,175,60,5.0,8/7/2017,"So, the portions are crazy huge.  The menu is practically a chapter book.  Gina was our server and she was the absolute BEST. Really helped us narrow down our options and everyone was really happy with her recommendations."
David A.,"Buford, GA",122,167,156,3.0,2/20/2017,"First off know that I dislike chains, but am willing to accept when there is one my wife very much likes, for example the Cheesecake factory. We frequent the Pleasanton location and have been to San Mateo as well as other ones in the US like Austin, TX and Union Square. This particular location is always insanely packed. That said, the staff is always all over the place in a good way. Never had a ""bad meal"" here and the staff is pretty good at making drinks. That said, I never had an awesome tasting meal at this location either and portions are not huge. An all-around ok place to go, but in a place like Pleasanton you can find equal quality at lower prices at a place not quite as packed.  And let's get into prices: this location has cheaper prices than SF."
Blake B.,"St. George, UT",86,1,,4.0,7/22/2017,"Overall, I had a great restaurant experience. It was very, very busy, and so naturally some things took a little longer than expected, but the waitress was kind and professional. The food tasted amazing. The only negative thing I can say about my experience is that my friend did have to wait an extra 20 minutes for his food and hebrest of us were about done eating by the time he got his food. Other than that, great dining experience."
V K.,"Hayward, CA",7,313,30,3.0,8/28/2017,"Came here for the large amount of options, plus hubby seems to like the place - he ordered the 10oz bone in NY Steak and said it was okay, not great, the char marks had no flavor. Daughter had the Chicken Parm Sandwich - it was huge, she couldn't bite it - had to take it home, it's still in the fridge. I had a new item, the Truffle-Honey Chicken, with mash potatoes and asparagus - it was decent but I couldn't taste the truffle - when you think about it, the truffle flavor would be over powered by honey. The mojito I had was too sweet, there was a refreshing component that was just missing and I tried to muddle the mint more. Daughter loved her mango slush thing, hubby did not complain about the beer. Service was friendly."
L F.,"San Jose, CA",0,69,36,2.0,8/9/2017,"I like a lot about this place even though it's a chain. But recently really disappointed.  I ordered my usual Cobb Salad. I was very upset to see cold, nasty chicken - not freshly cooked like they used to do!  This is a deal killer for me. Not cooking chicken fresh is really lousy (and it tastes that way too - cold and slimey).  Blech...don't think I'll be back"
Vivian A.,"San Ramon, CA",99,9,,4.0,10/28/2017,"We were totally excited, called ahead for reservation not allowed since we only a party of 4. I asked if you did call aheads, No call aheads. An hour & half later.  We were all excited! Just to be very disappointed :( Some of the food came out cold & our server was pretty much mediocre & didn't really know the drinks. It's totally ok,we are not In for anything just giving you feedback. This happen several months ago.  The best was just the Cheesecake & that was taken home! We couldn't handle the disappointing experience we had & the disorganization of how you handle seating your guests. Host was literally changing times when we're going to be sat first 45, hour, one hour & 38 minutes later.  The one in Scottsdale AZ, is the best next & the one in Park Meadows in Denver.  Definitely need to be organized when sitting guest instead if leaving them absolutely clueless!  Only coming back for Cheesecake & that will only be for take  out!  We were at the Apple Store & husband suggested that we go to the Cheesecake Factory since were there in the area. Pleasant surprise & we had a very nice server & enjoyed her hospitality. A much improved visit from the one we had last time. Kudos to Prescella for a great dining experience.  The only thing I would suggest is that we had the chilequias ? Paying $13.50 for a big bowl  of chips & great big dollop of sour cream & very little  carnitas a total of six small pieces of carnitas which were actually quite tasty.  The dining experience huge improvement from the last time. Yay!  10.28.17"
Peter H.,"San Ramon, CA",0,32,6,2.0,11/20/2017,"The food and service at this place has gone downhill quickly over the years. Don't usually eat the bread or chips that come out for free at restaurants because I don't want to fill myself beforehand. But, this time I had to since our order took about 45 minutes to come out. One person at our table ordered skinny salmon and requested no salt. But we definitely tasted salt on the fish. The everything pizza was missing a couple toppings. Two people ordered orange chicken and the waiter asked whether we would like to do half chicken and half shrimp. Thought that was odd since I never heard of that suggestion ever before of all the other times I've been to a Cheesecake location. One person took it and the other did not. When these came out, the plate that was supposed to be shrimp+chicken did not have any shrimp. And the order with just chicken was literally half the size of the shrimp+chicken order. Not to mention, the chicken this time around was not the squarish chunk pieces they served back then. The chicken only order literally was not more than 10 small pieces and had a dry texture instead. The waiter said this is because the shrimp+chicken plate is almost twice the price. We were told they'd make it right. 30 minutes later.....nothing. And throughout this whole dining, out waiter tried to keep on getting us to order more (to up his tip I presume). He would say things like, ""Do you want to order another dish if this one is not good?"" or, ""I see you finished the pizza, do you want to try some other dish?"" etc. This waiter sounded like an experienced car salesman."
R K.,"Modesto, CA",66,28,10,1.0,12/25/2017,"Came here for my sister's birthday dinner. 8 people. Food was gross. We waited 2 hours to be seated and an hour for food. Ridiculous! Do not come here. Wasted over $200. If your chefs can't handle the crowd, then hire another chef! Oh and calm down with the huuuuge portions. The amount of food you serve is good for 2-4 people. My sister left almost crying because she was so disappointed."
Eugene L.,"East Bay, CA",2440,1843,67233,5.0,6/29/2016,"I am Currently on my Staycation until July 5th.  After having a Fortune Teller at the last YEE tell me I was going to be a Homeless Person in a Year. I figured I better live it up and live like a Baller this Year Lmfao !!! So after Charging my Ankle Bracelet and installing a Signal Booster on it I figured I would jump into my Whip Black Beauty and roll to the Cheesecake Factory and Pleasanton!! I went Old School and played White Snake and drove with the Top off and windows down. Since The Cheesecake Factory is located at Stone Ridge Mall  there's plenty of parking for your Whip !!! Since I'm a Future Homeless guy I happen to have a contact at the Cheesecake Factory. So when I street hiked from the Parking Lot and entered the Cheesecake Factory a beautiful Brunette Hostess was calling my name for a table.  I walked in like a Boss and was shown to a lovely table!!! My Server was a Gentleman named Nick . Nick was an Excellent Server my Coke never reached half empty because he kept refilling it.  He made sure I was comfortable and  he made me feel very VIP and Pampered!!!   I was brought some Sourdough  &. Molasses Bread it was very Fresh & Warm and Soft !!! Very good.  I ordered the Dynamite Shrimp and Crispy Crab Bites for Appetizers .  While I was waiting for my Apps the Kitchen Manager/ Chef came out and Said Hi !!! This guy is a Hard Worker!!! He works from 3pm to 2am in the morning!!! I could tell he take his job very serious!!! My Apps arrived at the same time. The Presentation was Flawless and very Appetizing in Appearance!!! They were both packed full of flavor!!! I also consider these a must order!!! Very Decadent and Delicious !!! For my Main Entree I ordered  the Grilled Ribeye Steak Medium Rare !!! If you order any good Steak cooked more than Medium Rare , you might as well go to In & Out and order a Hamburger lol! While I was waiting for my RibEye Steak the Kitchen Manager/ Chef came out in Chef Whites to see how my meal was going . Great guy !!! The Diners at the Table next to me were wondering about my Vip Treatment and asked me about it  I just smiled . One of the Diners asked me if I was a Yelper and I told him yes . He then told the Other Diners at his table that Yelpers are Ballers lol!!! My Rib Eye Steak came out and it was a Perfect Medium Rare and it was a Premium Boneless Cut with a nice mound of Mashed Potatoes and Steamed String Beans!!! My Rib Eye was so Tender it Melted in my mouth!!! The Mash Potatoes and String Beans were very tasty!!! I highly recommend dining at the Cheesecake Factory!!! The Level of Service and the Quality of Food  is Outstanding!!! This Cheesecake Factory is Definitely Baller On A Budget Approved!!!! Five Stars Fabulous!!!"
Jason P.,"Oakland, CA",19,126,,4.0,7/24/2017,"Babies, babies and more babies! We were surrounded by them. Make no mistake, this is a *family* restaurant. That said, my girlfriend and I had a good experience here. Of course there was the requisite 40 minute wait to get a table for lunch, but we had some stuff to get in the mall, so no big deal. You have to love all the menu options; if you can't find something on the menu that appeals to you here then you might want to check your pulse to see if you're even alive. At any rate, the food and service were both up to par, and we hope to be back soon!"
Emmalee R.,"Patterson, CA",114,2,,3.0,10/22/2017,"Ate here on a Sunday night, guess that was our mistake. Was super busy and was quoted 40 minutes, by the time we were seated it has been nearly two hours. Got our drinks and bread quickly so we thought the service was turning around. When we ordered we were then informed there was no more pizza dough which is what I wanted. I ordered something different, little sister got her food super quickly but took at least 30 more minutes for our food to come out."
Iesha M.,"Oakland, CA",58,6,6,4.0,4/7/2017,"Learned a lesson in patience. We rarely  go out on a Friday night because I hate waiting more than 45 minutes to be seated etc. My feeling is when a restaurant is packed the service isn't that great. However, the Cheesecake factory proved me wrong. We were told the wait for a table would be an hour to seat our party of 5, we were seated within 30 mins. Our waitress Jessie was very sweet and catered to our 5 year old daughter. She took her order first and went back to place the order, if you eat with kids you know they don't hold still for very long and will start complaining that they are hungry. The manager came out with her food, and apologized and told us then that the kitchen was backed up and it will be awhile. It took about an hour to get our food but our daughter was happy. So I actually didn't feel impatience.   Now the food. The food was good. Not horrible, not exceptional, just good. They give you a lot of food, I recommended sharing a dish. We took more than half of our dish home.  Desert was awesome again with Jessie catered to our 5 year old.  Overall Food- good worth the price Service was Great. Jessie Rocks!!!"
