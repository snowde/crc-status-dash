Homer S.,"San Francisco, CA",174,233,299,5.0,7/18/2011,"I didn't realize I haven't reviewed this place even though I frequent it a lot.    The big reason why I think this place gets such low marks is because the wait can be crazy.   But I'm sure if it was really that bad then nobody would go there but it has 3 stars and its packed almost all the time.   Favorites are the Asian Chicken Salad.    The red velvet cheesecake, banana cheesecake, and the Mike's Chocolate."
James W.,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",59,1025,49,4.0,2/14/2015,"For a chain, this place is usually consistently pretty good with food and service. The Pleasanton location is no exception. Usually always crowded, with a high energy atmosphere. We dined here for lunch today (I had the fish tacos) and thought the experience overall was very good."
Marzi M.,"La Habra, CA",19,67,103,1.0,8/17/2015,I have been coming to this location so frequently and it seems that the service quality is deteriorating every time we are here. Our server Laura seemed to be the laziest server ever. She actually kept us waiting for our food and went to a break without introducing anyone else instead of her to take care of us - which is the standard norm in any upscale restaurant!  2 other servers including Mark came to our rescue. I am appalled with such service....
Almog H.,"San Leandro, CA",10,32,7,1.0,1/12/2016,First of all of those possible way to -5 stars that's what I would do so we came in at 10:43 PM and the manager was very rude to us is probably wanted to go home and you didn't little steam we came about seven people to eat and he just kicked us out of the place very rudely where explaining that it's only 1043 and you didn't even potential to us said just leave and he probably was racist as well he was an African-American when we came in speaking different language that's when he was looking at is definitely very bad experience with the Cheesecake Factory we understand that he's tired and wants to go home but is a way to explain customers not just to open the door and tell us to leave me personally will never come back in here and I will make a complaint with the corporate office
m l.,"Oakland, CA",98,29,34,4.0,1/13/2015,Minus one star for wait time Food is decent  Challenging to hear waiter with loud environment  Great cheesecake! I shall return
Anne N.,"San Leandro, CA",10,76,88,5.0,9/29/2013,"It's the Cheesecake Factory... Every plate you are going to have big portions and will leave feeling content. Service is usually very friendly and it's perfect for any occasion. The only thing I wish they would change is to have reservations but that is for every cheesecake.  Great location with plenty of parking. On the other hand it still gets crowded on weekends and in the evening so get there sooner than later. Spacious restaurant. My favorites are the Navajo sandwich, Renee's lunch special, and every appetizer is great. Naturally every cheesecake option is large and heavy bit delicious. My favorite is the thirty year anniversary."
Kevin G.,"Tracy, CA",47,56,1,3.0,1/24/2016,"Our server was great. Attentive and friendly. Food was very bland. My son got the orange chicken and had no taste. I got a chipotle chicken pasta and chicken was good but pasta bland. My daughter got the veggie burger and no taste. We did order some cheesecake for dessert and those were amazing. So if you go to this place for drinks or cheesecake, this place is amazing. But for food, not very good and a lot better choices in Pleasanton for similar or lower prices."
Jen L.,"Agoura Hills, CA",195,584,253,3.0,8/8/2013,Perfect place to stop in before or after shopping.  Love the tropical iced tea. Don't forget to leave room for dessert. Currently loving the skinny menu options(soft tacos or flatbread pizza) Food: ++ chicken wrap App- I get it as a meal sometimes ++ garlic chicken farfalle +factory burrito + bagel with lox + mushroom burger +build your own omelet ++Bbq chicken salad - love the onion tanglers on top DESSERT and DRINKS ALWAYS order pumpkin pecan cheesecake only around OCT-end of year ++ apple strudel cheesecake ++ lemon raspberry CC ++chocolate coconut CC ++ Chris' outrageous CC + peach Bellini ++Georgia peach
W A.,"Livermore, CA",2,36,2,2.0,11/28/2015,"After a 50 min wait, which is usual for this place, half of our order was cold. The shrimp in the pasta was frozen and there was a hair in the steak!!!!! Gross!!! The manager took the pasta dish without asking any questions and brought back one with chicken and shrimp. When we corrected her....she got annoyed with us!!!!! Seriously?!!!! We come here all the time.....not anymore!!!! I would give them 1 star but usually it's a good experience.  I know it's the busiest time of the year for these people but they should really hire a manager with a but more patience for problems that will come up in a place like this."
Tee F.,"San Leandro, CA",1,27,11,1.0,8/24/2016,"I'd give this place ZERO stars if I could. We came here for dinner for my daughter's birthday and it was by far THE WORST service I ever had. Lenin V was our server tonight & apparently it was his 1st day... Let's start with the appetizers. We ordered calamari, garlic bread, and crab & artichoke dip. The garlic bread never came and out came 1 1/2 steamed artichokes... Uh - NO... It took forever to get our dinner. My daughter ordered the kids salmon. It came with COLD mashed potatoes and COLD steamed carrots! WTF! Happy Birthday sweetie - you get cold food for your birthday dinner! The rice on my husband's plate was hard like it's been sitting in a pot all day! And for dessert? I ordered the Red Velvet Cheesecake... Dude said ""the lemon?"" What in the world? ""Lemon"" and ""Red Velvet"" don't even sound the same! My daughter wanted them to sing happy birthday to her, but we didn't even bother to ask cuz it probably woulda taken the server another hour to do it and get it all wrong! This guy needs to listen to his customers better cuz he had it all wrong tonight! His apologized so many times I stopped looking at him when he came to our table to hear his excuses... $221 was the bill for the worst food and service we ever had! Never ever again will we come to this AWEFUL place! I was happy to get the hell out of there!"
Dolly C.,"Manteca, CA",0,7,,1.0,2/22/2016,"Had a very bad experience at this location. On Saturday, we had a luncheon with a group of 18. Knowing they do not take reservations, we checked in at 11:30 and were told it would be a 2 hour wait. Since we were waiting on others to arrive we decided to wait. We waited outside for 2 hours and decided to relocate inside to see if our tables were ready. As we were standing there waiting, the hostess announced a table was ready for a party of 13 (they arrived after us and only 4 people in that party were there). Several people from our party spoke to the manager and we were seated shortly after. They had only 1 waitress taking care of our large party. Everyone had eaten and were packing there food to go except for my friend the across the table. She was still waiting on her meal. Once again the manager was called out. She offered to pay for her meal and offered here a slice of cheesecake. Her meal was ruined. She wanted to eat while here friends were eating not after they were all done. To top it off, I couldn't believe they charged her for her lemonade. After such bad service that should have been paid for as well. I will never go to this location again. Very disappointed"
Junayd L.,"Irvine, CA",32,71,90,4.0,7/13/2015,"When my family and I got  to CCF we had to wait 15-25 minutes,but took a shorter amount of time. Before we got to our booth our hostist was very kind and didn't complain about our changes.Food was great but service was very slow... Our waiter disappeared for long periods of time .Overall I had a good evening out."
Anudari K.,"San Francisco, CA",181,99,592,5.0,6/18/2014,"This place is my guilty pleasure. I am so happy with almost all the food thats on the menu.  Service - Especially for a chain restaurant as busy as this place, the service is GREAT every time. A little distracted maybe but i don't actually mind, this is probably the only place i wouldn't mind if i have to flag down a waiter/waitress. This place is ridiculously busy almost any given time of the day. So yea im more than sympathetic to that. But still the service is great.  I just wish they took reservation. That would be awesome.  Food - very inexpensive and huge huge portion. (Tastes goood too) Im literally not exaggerating when i say that you could share a plate w a person. I have never finished a dish there before! Ever! One thing----please serve warm butter w the bread because its a little weird that the butter is cold."
D G.,"Turlock, CA",0,9,,4.0,8/21/2016,"Went to lunch, sat outside.  Kevin was our server.  His kindness and attention to details is unparalleled.  We have eaten here several times and we have never had such great service.  Kevin's genuine and sincere demeanor was greatly appreciated.  Also, we're not relatives of Kevin's.  Promote Kevin to management and/or server training manager.  We live in the valley and frequent Stoneridge Mall.  The food is above average.  The cheesecake and Kevin's service far exceeds average."
Fashions M.,"Emeryville, CA",2,54,10,1.0,11/20/2015,"Use to come here all the time now I realize why I don't. Reserved a table for 6... Was given 6 menus and seated at a table with 4 plates and 4 sets of silverware. Someone came out and gave us six waters and bread than left. Another gentle man came out and asked if we were ready to order didn't introduce himself no hi no nothing just asked if we were ready to order. I found that pretty rude.  Asked if we could get the other plates for the other 2 people so they can eat some bread too. Finally got our orders... My friends fried mashed potatoe balls were cold. Waiter only once asked  how the food was and I had to ask for refill of water!???  He couldn't even do that he dropped ice in one of the cups and it splashed the water on the table and on my arm. He came back a 2nd time I thought he was going to ask how everything was but nope he asked us if we saved room for dessert. Shit I was still half way eating my meal can I finish eating first? I felt rushed and will not be back. I often eat out with big groups of 6-10 people so we are easily spending $100-$300 as a group. He shoved a dessert menu in my face literally and I told him I was still eating he decided to start clearing the table too bad I was still eating from the plate he was trying to take. I told him to stop rushing me like wtf!!??? We tipped him 25% if anyone was wondering . Food was typical nothing special..., just wish service would be better. Due to the weird waiter I will never be back here and neither will my friends."
Derek F.,"San Ramon, CA",85,85,46,2.0,5/21/2014,"Sat quickly but was ignored for 20 minutes. No water, appetizer order, or entrée. They weren't even bus and attend to people who arrived far later than I did.  This is not the first time either. My apologies to the hostess who received the brunt of my anger. It was not your fault. It was the lazy servers outside. Thanks again for wasting a third of my lunch hour."
Jaqk T.,"Livermore, CA",22,46,9,2.0,8/6/2014,"Overpriced. Poor Service. Below Average food. If it weren't for the Cheescakes i would give this place one star. I'm only reviewing THIS particular Location (i've had great experiences at other places).  We ordered the Fried Cat Fish. It was just soo bad I can't even explain. It had that bitter taste that comes with re-using the fryer one too many times. We also had two small sides Stuffed Mushrooms and Potatoe Balls those were decent, but nothing amazing. I just feel like for the amount of money it should be better all around.  I know they can't help this, but their outside seating is right next to the parkinglot of Macy's so you get plenty of burnt fuel with your meal. Just a bad experience."
Frank E.,"San Ramon, CA",148,133,181,4.0,9/17/2013,The teriyaki chicken is the bomb !!! Love the grilled banana and pineapple  !  Brown rice mmmm mmmm good !!
David L.,"Dublin, CA",145,185,,2.0,10/13/2015,"Can't say the food was bad, because that was some pretty damn good Louisiana Chicken Pasta and Reese's' Peanut Butter Caramel Cheesecake. Although, we were told while calling in advance that the wait would be ~20min at 8pm on a Friday night. Then when we got there, we were told very clearly that it would be a ~15min wait. Oh ho ho, it turned out to be a full hour wait for us to get seated. We were seated in a nice little corner outside and our server was definitely very warm and helpful, so points for that. Want a nice night out? Count on the hour wait time and go elsewhere."
Leonardo G.,"Seattle, WA",191,5,4,2.0,1/1/2016,"Seated 30 minutes after our reservation, waited 30 minutes for our desert after the meal. Rarely saw our server. Slow service."
