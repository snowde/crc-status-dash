Scott B.,"Berkeley, CA",0,15,2,1.0,1/1/2016,"I like the food, however they do not take reservations. This leads to this hunger games mentality at the host stand. Not to mention the people at the host station have no concept of time whatsoever. So if they tell you 50 minutes, be prepared for at least a 90 minute wait. I will no longer go to his establishment until it's more organized."
Olivia W.,"Berkeley, CA",467,58,10,1.0,7/23/2015,"Poor and slow service, not to mention bad food! It was overly salty and the pasta was dry. I got ""Evelyn's Favorite"" (pasta dish) and it really could not possibly anyone's favorite. The cheesecake was overly sweet and thick, though I kind of expected that. However it really didn't seem fully cooked as it was super floppy and kind of melted in its plate rather than being firm and upright. Will not be returning"
Vicky M.,"Dublin, CA",0,27,1,3.0,12/24/2014,"What happen to TCF?? It used to be so good and a place that my family enjoyed so much. We went in at 5:30 and got seated around 6:30pm for 6 of us. Ordered Chicken Marsala & Mushroom, Daily special soup: Chick and vegetable chowder, Shrimp Scampi, Oriental Chicken Salad, Sweet Corn Tamales, Banana Cream Cheesecake and Mango Lime Cheesecake. Taste was so blend for the savories and we had to asked for salt and pepper. Desserts used to be more flavorful but that day, the Mango Lime was really sour and the Banana Cream Cheesecake was too soft of a texture. Come on, TCF ! Please bring back the deliciousness of this place !"
Marcus D.,"Livermore, CA",7,81,14,3.0,7/21/2016,"Was there on Wednesday. Server was great and so was the food.  We had to get going as we had an appointment.  We went to get three slices of cheesecake on our way out.  Instead of getting it right there and then like most places,  we were  told ""we will call your name when it's ready"". We looked at each other and wondered why we had to wait. With nobody else at the counter,  it took 15 minutes to get our three slices of cheesecake which made us late for our appointment.  Not very happy about that."
Hong T.,"Oakland, CA",12,86,22,1.0,11/4/2015,A very decent restaurant best to have a get together with friends. Their cocktails definitely don't meet my standard among all restaurants yet it only had to do with the bartender. Food and cheesecakes are mediocre.
Aidan G.,"San Francisco, CA",1,47,1,1.0,8/21/2015,"We waited forty minutes for our to go order. When we went to ask if it was ready it had been sitting at the takeout counter for an indeterminate time. The guy at the counter's excuse was ""I didn't know who it was for."" The lack of trying to figure it out is the real problem here."
LaSheila H.,"Manteca, CA",0,18,14,2.0,1/23/2015,Went here tonight for dinner with two of my friends from high school that I hadn't seen for at least 8 years. We had an hour and 15 minute wait the service was slow the food arrived cold. One of my friends did not like her shrimp was too hard she sent it back barely touch and the manager charge her full price. Being that it was a Friday night I will give them a 2 star usually there better service.
Cece E.,"Dublin, CA",141,544,1065,3.0,9/13/2014,"Huge menu. Food was just OK. Very Loud. Service was a bit hit-and-miss. Arrived for dinner at 6:00pm on a Tuesday night. The wait for an indoor table was abysmally long. We decided to sit on the patio with the understanding that they would keep us on the list to move inside when a table freed up. Bad move. The patio turned uncomfortably chilly after the sun set. We were eventually moved indoors but not until we put up a fuss. Stuffed Mushrooms appetizer $6.95 (Just meh. Came in a cast iron baking dish but swimming in oil) Iced Black Tea $2.95 Skinny LI Iced Tea $10.95 Avocado Eggrolls $10.95 Asian Lettuce Wrap Tacos $6.95 Hibachi Steak $19.95 (This was the hit with the group. Meat was tender; sauce was sweet.) Skinny Turkey & Avocado Sandwich $10.50 Pear & Blue Cheese Flatbread $6.50 Skinny Asian Chicken Salad $13.95 Skinny Chicken Soft Tacos $9.95 Mushroom Burger $12.95 We also ordered 4 kid's meals at around $6.50 each. Disappointing. The kid's picked out the pepperoni. They said it tasted funny. They did love the chocolate milk and the ice cream. Kid's Pepperoni Pizza  Kid's Mac 'n Cheese  2 Kid's Cheese Pizza  3 chocolate milks 2 birthday sundaes Of course we also got cheesecake, the best part of the meal. The fresh banana cheesecake was delicious. The Godiva chocolate cheesecake was decadent. The chocolate mousse was so rich that even between the 4 kids and my mom, about half of the slice still had to be packed to go. I won't avoid CF but now I remember why we don't make it a regular habit, too expensive for meh food and so-so service. We only come here for large family gatherings when everybody is coming straight from work or school with no time to cook."
Tracy L.,"San Ramon, CA",195,825,207,1.0,7/5/2012,"So peeved. We ordered take-out for curb-side pick-up.  When my husband got home, we realized they gave us someone else's order!  This location is 15 minutes away from us, so going back to get the right order is unreasonable. The manager was apologetic and refunded our $71 (they charged us for what we ordered, which I told him was obviously more expensive that what we ordered).  However, he should have tossed in a gift card or free cheesecake slice for our next visit for all the annoyance.  Yes, we got a free dinner, but it wasn't very good - veggie burger (composted most of it after we each took one bite), chicken salad sandwich which was mediocre, fried shrimp appetizer.  Worst of all, there was nothing for my young toddler to eat but bread. I specifically told my husband not to tip for take-out, so he didn't. He said the waitress who brought the food out looked like she didn't appreciate the no-top status...but now we feel completely justified. So, lesson learned: I told my hubby to never assume. Always check at least the top box of food to make sure he got the right order."
Sudipta N.,"Dublin, CA",1,1,,1.0,12/15/2015,If your server name is JULIO ask for change of server immediately.. I love food at Cheesecake Factory but today was the worst experience ever..
Rachel S.,"Pleasanton, CA",757,547,284,4.0,9/19/2010,"I enjoy eating at the Cheesecake Factory with my three daughters. Anytime I go, there's always some sort of wait, whether it be 10 minutes or 40 minutes. Well, I take that back...when I've gone at 11:30 on a Sunday morning and 10:00 on a Thursday night, I haven't had to wait to be seated. Rule of thumb: don't go here if you're on a time crunch. I stick to the same thing when I come here: deep fried zucchini appetizer and chicken marsala entree. The deep fried zucchini are my favorite appetizer from here, delicious with the ranch dressing. The chicken madeira never disappoints, I usually have to take half home.  They added a children's menu, not too long ago. The portions are perfect size for kids. My daughter's choices are usually the chicken strips, mac and cheese and corn dogs. All entrees come with a side of french fries.  I usually don't get cheesecake, unless I'm reallllly in the mood. Even at that, we have to take it home. I'm a fan of just the regular cheesecake or the Godiva chocolate cheesecake.  You definitely pay the price for the portion size, but it's a nice place to come with the kids, family or a group of friends."
Laurie B.,"Union City, CA",4,13,2,1.0,10/23/2015,"After car shopping, decided to grab a quick bite to eat, thinking it was still early for the dinner rush. Resturant was semi-full, still had to wait 5 mins to get seated (which was odd). When seated, we sat there for a good 10 mins with no response from our waitress. No water.. no nothing.  Funny how the manager or assistant manager was catering to those already eating and not us and galso giving out discounts to their meals as if they were talking to God or something (I'm sure to win business over with good reviews). I'm really disgusted with this place. You just lost a loyal customer. No wonder why this place has 3 stars. Pathetic."
Tareque M.,"San Ramon, CA",170,13,43,4.0,3/20/2015,"Awesome food , nice service, wait time was not so long, my japanese friend even chatted with the waitress for a while...  They have a large outside sitting system. We chose to seat outside. Avocado roll, shrimp dynamite, kalamari all the appetizers were delicious. Tropical smoothie is good. I tried bang bang chiken and shrimp, completely differnt taste. They also have food for the health conscious ppl. We went during the peak time (evening). So, we had to stand for a while to get the seat as we were 1p people in total. Parking might be an issue, but after the feast, its good to have a walk for a while. I have to go to the gym for next couple of days ....grrrrrr (i hate gym). Last but not the list, their cheese cake, it's yammy , too much cheese, its hard to resist ......sad thing is, my cell phone went out of charge, so couldn't take a single pic.."
Ed B.,"Dublin, CA",1,25,,1.0,1/30/2016,Great food but unbelievable how short staffed the waitstaff is and management doesn't seem to step in and support. Waiters and waitresses doing everything themselves turning a meal into a long adventure.
Amber R.,"Antioch, CA",4,125,117,4.0,9/16/2014,"What great service and food. Our waitress was the curly haired girl who served the patio. Stuffed mushrooms and chicken gumbo were my order. Food was piping hot and I love the patio seating, I've been to walnut creek and vowed never to go back, yet I enjoyed this food tonight and will come back to this location. My lost star, is because they were out of the cake I wanted, and they don't have another suitable option."
Joe G.,"Dublin, CA",1,4,,5.0,1/4/2016,My wife and I along with our 1 1/2 year old son came in today. We had Will as our waiter. He was extremely friendly and very good with kids. He even brought our son his own plate of bananas and bread. Which my son ate up fast. He is a great waiter and hope we sit in his section the next time we go.
Nicole W.,"San Ramon, CA",43,1,,2.0,7/28/2016,"I really like this restaurant and I want to believe they were just maybe having an off night, but service was at an all time low tonight. I can only assume they were understaffed. The entire patio section was closed for some reason, which is why I thought maybe understaffing. So we had to wait a little longer for a small table inside. The couple next to us received their food a few minutes after we sat down and had finished and been long gone before we received our dinner. The new couple who sat down in their place had to ask for silverware twice and was told to hold on because they were looking for some. Long periods of time went in between checking our table and our server seemed confused. We were never given plates for our bread this time so we just used our napkins. The guacamole on hubby's quesadilla was suspiciously veering towards brown while the guac on my tacos was a fresh green. The drink refill was flat and tasted odd every other refill so not sure what was going on there. Either way, I was just very disappointed in our visit and am hoping that this is not a warning of things to come :("
Alyssa S.,"Waipahu, HI",27,2,,1.0,7/27/2016,"The worst experience at a Cheesecake Factory. I didn't mind waiting 20-30 minutes to be seated, it was lunch time and the meal was ok but we decided to get a slice of cheesecake to go. After waiting at the counter for 15 minutes, there were plenty of workers standing around and not one told us that they'd help us. I had to flag someone down to finally take our order. After another 10 minutes of waiting for our order we didn't even think anyone was going to get to it so we asked for our money back. That was a HUGE ordeal too. Took another 10-15 minutes to finally accomplish that. It should never take over 30 minutes to get a slice of cheesecake. Me and my husband will never go back to this location and I hope this makes someone else not go either."
Morgan H.,"Alameda, CA",24,12,12,4.0,6/25/2014,"Line: we were seated so fast!! As soon as we walked in.  Drinks: the Shirley temples and waters were huge! Appetizers: crab and artichoke dip... Sooooo good. Ahi tartare..... Even better. Had the Santa Fe salad and it tasted healthy and yummy! Also, I got the lunch size instead of dinner size and it was so big I couldn't finish it! Entree: my boyfriend had the filet, medium rare. I had a bite and it was sooo tasty  Wait time: appetizers came out fast! Entrees took a little longer but it was perfect timing for us. Service: our waiter, Tina, was sweet and helpful. Very nice! Overall: wish I could give a 4.5 out of 5"
Kelly G.,"San Ramon, CA",0,73,8,5.0,1/22/2016,"I'm giving 5 stars to the bar area. In particular, JOAQUIN. My husband and I go out to dinner very frequently. But before we eat, we like to enjoy a cocktail. I'm very picky about my cocktails and about my bartender. We are bar owners ourselves. I'm writing because of the truly outstanding service we consistently receive from Joaquin (and Soresh). The drinks are so tasty. I drink the fresh strawberry martini. As busy as this place is, we get great service every time. Joaquin is the sweetest man. We always look forward to seeing him. We continue to come back because of him. Even if we're eating far away, we often go out of our way to stop by and enjoy a drink with Joaquin. Bravo! Whatever you're paying him....it isn't enough!"
