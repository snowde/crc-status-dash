Melissa P.,"San Ramon, CA",124,99,321,4.0,6/6/2014,"This place is good. Good for a decent priced night out to eat with the lady. It has basically everything in the menu so you can choose from whatever your feeling.  The locations great. If your out shopping at the mall it's right outside. I recommend coming early or making reservations because since it's the only Cheesecake Factory in the area, it tends to get super busy anytime of the week.  If you choose to sit outside, bring a jacket! Night times in Pleasanton are cold before July!"
Shannon H.,"Brentwood, CA",749,1031,606,3.0,5/15/2012,"Certainly not one of my favorite Cheesecake Factory's. I have been to quite a few different Factory's through out the years and have always been very impressed with the overall architectural and interior structures of the chain restaurants. The food is just your typical chain style food with nothing really spectacular ( besides there cheesecakes) with more than generous portions. The location is convenient being located in the Stone Ridge Mall, though I would have to say, it is probably the smallest Cheesecake factory I have been to, with the interior being not as impressive. I met up here with some friends recently. I ordered the Chicken Balagio which is Crispy Coated Chicken Breast over Basil Pasta and Parmesan Cream Sauce Topped with Prosciutto and Arugula Salad. I opted out on the arugula salad on top. Our meals arrived with in a reasonable amount of time. The presentation of  the food was nothing too too appealing but decent. The amount of pasta was monstrous. The chicken was lightly breaded and quite tasty and the Parmesan sauce ( which I had to ask for more) was incredible delicious! I also had a bite of my friends Dulce De Lech Cheesecake which tasted like heaven. Our service was also extremely attentive, quick and friendly. Overall, its a nice, fun, place to gather with friends. The food is usually a hit and miss though, the cheesecakes never disappoint : ) and our service this night ( as well as most of my Cheesecake Factory visits) have always been quite good.Prices are also reasonable considering the portions served."
Marissa G.,"Union City, CA",139,74,30,5.0,9/14/2015,"This review is for Deanna :) so I called in for a take out order and of course I ordered what I always order, pasta carbonara w/chicken. I asked if I could extra sauce on the side.. (Because I wasn't going to eat it right away, I live about 25 minutes away.. So usually pasta gets dry if you don't eat it as soon as it's served) anyways! I didn't personally get a chance to meet her. My brother went in an picked up the order for me! But she's literally so nice she had a whole cup filled with extra sauce for me! Thanks girl you're the best!"
Alexys E.,"Antioch, CA",80,334,325,5.0,1/15/2013,"Went here for High School Graduation back in June with my twin sis and family. We finally tried the fried mac and cheese balls.....so I'm giving this review five stars just for that.  And this is irrelevant, but two women paid for me and my sister's cheesecakes as a graduation gift! Thanks again although this was awhile ago!"
Tony S.,"San Francisco, CA",0,4,,3.0,12/14/2015,"We were told that the wait was 40-50 mins. When we followed up with the host, she said ""You've only been waiting for 22 mins and I told you that it's 40-50 mins, you still have to wait 30 mins.."" Once our pager started vibrating, we were directed to our table. Lo and behold, we saw about 8 empty tables along the row of our table near the bar.. Wow.. Not cool... :/ Once we sat down, we were given our bread right away. We liked the chocolate/brown bread. The other one was not that good. Our server, Tyler, was great. He was attentive. The food we ordered were only okay, nothing to rave about.. We got the Factory Combinations: Shrimp Scampi & Salmon; and the Shrimp Scampi & Steak Diane. They were smaller in portions. We thought the shrimp scampi would have pasta in it but it was just probably 3 shrimps in there, no pasta. The Steak Diane was a little too sweet for my taste. Their cocktails were good but when we asked for something off the menu, they weren't able to get it right. Hopefully next time, they can just be honest and say that they don't know how to make it. But you really would come here for their cheesecakes and the Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake and Tiramisu Cheesecake were to die for!!! Yummy!!! Overall, the experience was okay except for the ""mandatory"" long wait for a table. Their hosts could have been a little bit more approachable and gracious about it."
Kari C.,"Walnut Creek, CA",330,665,1115,4.0,9/23/2012,"Not bad at all. We were intrigued about Cheesecake Factory after reading about their restaurant operations in an article by Atul Gawande, surgeon and author. Food is about 3.5 stars and service was excellent. It was a busy Sunday lunch, but we were given a buzzer and were seated in about 10 minutes, exactly as promised. Me and DH only got water, but their selection of alcoholic & non-alcoholic beverages was vast. They brought warm, fresh bread over and it was delicious! Cold butter too! Such a nice surprise. There was a soft, chewy, mild sourdough and a dark wheat bread with a hint of sweetness, topped with oat flakes. DH really liked the dark bread, even though he's not a carb-lover like I am. I got a lunch sized portion of the famous Miso Salmon, plated on brown rice, and served with snow peas. Everything was fresh and the rice was softer and fluffier than I anticipated. Sauce was sweet and teriyaki-like. There were a few dabs of a creamy sauce. It all went well together. Snow peas were fresh, but had some fibrous bits. Salmon was fully cooked, a lot more done than I would have liked, but I learned from the server that I could have ordered it rare. There wasn't a trace of fishiness at all. Portion size for lunch is still bigger than what a normal person could eat! DH got the crab scramble with hash browns. I tried a bite and thought it was bland. I couldn't taste any crab in it. Hash browns seemed a bit undercooked in the middle and there wasn't enough ""browning"" for my liking. I think it was just undersalted. DH's portion was massive, covering an entire dinner-sized plate. He took about 1/2 of it home. Prices for dessert aren't cheap, but portions are also large. We got the tiramisu for $7.50, DH's favorite, which was surprisingly good! The flavors of chocolate, almond, and coffee were perfectly balanced. I would have preferred deeper chocolate notes, but that's my own bias towards dark chocolate. It had a nice amount of creaminess and the ladyfingers were not overly soggy. There was a massive amount of whipped cream, but we didn't eat all of that.  DH thought it wasn't a good deal, but overall, a pretty good experience. It is kind of loud inside, not really too romantic. A lot of people brought their kids. Definitely better quality food than other places that are kid-friendly, such as Carrow's or Denny's. One other gripe: some of our silverware was not completely clean. They had bits of leftover food stuck between the tines. We didn't ask to have them replaced, but I'm sure that they would have done so."
Connie T.,"Dublin, CA",95,5,5,2.0,11/4/2015,"The restaurant was very crowded and freezing cold.  Our waiter kept forgetting silverware and we waited a long time for our dishes.  However the food was excellent.  I am giving only 2 stars because of the slow, and poor service and the temp in the restaurant was so uncomfortable."
Kitty T.,"Fremont, CA",0,7,9,4.0,11/1/2014,Every time we go here the foods are always good and came out perfect.  My chicken breath topping with mozzarella and mushroom with special sauce so tender.  Sea food pastas with red sauce great as always.
Landlubber L.,"Fremont, CA",0,48,14,3.0,10/28/2013,"The cheesecakes and cakes in the display case all look so inviting but I usually come for the food. The portions have gotten slightly smaller in the last couple of years. Where the patty once used to cover the bottom half of a brioche bun, it now covers about two-thirds. Plus, the patties are flatter. The factory burritos favored by the kid has more rice than before.  And, at this location, they now nickel-and-dime you for the side dishes. The other night we wanted to swap a side of xx with a veggie for the fish taco order. We were given a choice of carrots, broccoli, or asparagus. When the bill came, we noticed an extra charge added for choosing asparagus (all short and scrawny 4 stalks of it). The San Francisco TCF did not charge for asparagus, at least not 2 weeks ago. When something is gonna cost extra, let's be upfront about it, okay? Then we can make an informed decision about swapping out a side that COMES WITH the meal. I hate to niggle on this nominal charge, but I did.  TCF used to be inviting and generous with their food. They charge enough for their desserts and there are no shortage of customers ordering slices of cheesecakes. Yeh, yeh, it's a business doing what businesses do. You've just changed. :-/"
Jenn N.,"Brentwood, CA",722,778,894,5.0,5/8/2012,"Cody is the best waitress!  Thai lettuce wraps are an incredible value.  Yes, there is always a wait..but it's always worth it.  Just head over early and hang out in the mall for awhile."
David L.,"Castro Valley, CA",0,43,4,3.0,9/5/2015,"Not sure what happen, but the miso salmon was dry and the white rice is cold.  When ask for another bowl of rice it was soggy.  Also had to wait 1 hour for table and 20 min to  take order."
Lynn T.,"Stockton, CA",0,2,,1.0,7/3/2015,"The worse Cheesecake Factory I have ever been to, Service was horrible starting from the hostess to the waitress to the manager!! Food was horrible!! Rice not cooked in the factory burrito! Espresso served cold..awful experience! Never again!! Would give zero stars if this app would let me!"
Rebecca K.,"Castro Valley, CA",0,5,,2.0,3/22/2016,Service has really declined in the past year.  Went with my husband last weekend for brunch. Pretty empty and we still waited 30 minutes for our meals. Mine arrived tasting like it was the last evening's microwaved leftovers.  My husband's meal took another 15 minutes and arrived stone cold. Manager offered to have his meal re-cooked but since we had waited for our food for 45 minutes we declined. Absolutely nothing else done. No apologies. Management here is terrible.
Scott J.,"Riverbank, CA",4,10,,5.0,11/25/2015,This is my wife's favorite place. Pretty good food and cheesecake. Price is good for what you get. They need to build one of these in Modesto.
Doug M.,"Hayward, CA",0,11,2,1.0,6/5/2015,"we went here on 6/4/15 for a nice birthday lunch. we waiting over 40 minutes for my wife's salad and soup(never brought it) and my shrimp scampi/chicken Madeira. the manager Al actually sat down and started his lunch 30 minutes into our wait. i walked over and said i see you got your lunch before we did. he then said he would comp our ticket. while waiting for that to happen, the waiter brought over my lunch that looked horrible and he kept apologizing that he had to make it himself. i told him to keep it and that my never received her food either. as we were at the counter to purchase a piece of cheese cake that waiting brought me a bill for the partially compt meal. i paid the 10 bucks just to get out of there. 2nd and last bad experience at this place."
Jane D.,"Pleasanton, CA",0,8,,1.0,12/16/2016,"This place has been steadily declining over the years. I'm done with them. From getting seated to the food quality to getting drink refills, I can say that there was nothing that was acceptable. We asked for bar seating. Three bar tables opened up. They sat, dirty, for at least five minutes. After they were clean, that sat clean for ten minutes. After staring at the three clean tables for ten, minutes, they seated us. And there we sat...and sat...and sat. Finally, someone came to the table and said, ""Is there something I can get you?"" There was no, ""Hi. I'll be your server tonight."" He seemed as if he noticed we were there for a while and was seeing if we had been served yet. I told him that we needed a server. He asked what he could get us. It was a very strange encounter. So, we ordered. And waited....and waited....and waited. About 25 minutes later, our ""nachos"" arrived. I guess they've abandoned the concept of cheese almost entirely. The ""cheese"" was this gloppy, gritty, pasty cheese sauce with a few sprinkles of real cheese on top. They were awful. I'd say it was canned cheese, but that would be an insult to canned cheese. Our drinks were never refilled. The table next to us was having an equally terrible experience. I will not be going back to this poorly managed establishment. Simply the worst, all the way around."
Vira P.,"San Francisco, CA",336,1141,1134,4.0,1/2/2011,"The reason why I'm adding an extra star is because of the table they gave us, and a pretty good meal.  The wait was standard for Cheesecake (about 20 mins) and they gave my party of three a table that could fit like 6-8 people.. I felt like VIP.. Anyway, I ordered the sweet tamale corn cakes, lunch portion orange chicken and a strawberry cheesecake.  The tamales were amazingly delicious!  I might have to stray from my usual order of avocado egg rolls as I was disappointed the last time I ordered them..  The orange chicken was standard, with the rice a little on the dry side.  But the next day after microwaving the leftovers, the flavors solidified and it tasted better.  And of course, there's never a complaint about the cheesecake. I've been lucky coming here during their non-peak hours.  But I'm sure a long wait won't deter me from having a good meal."
Meghan M.,"Washington, DC",38,54,90,2.0,5/2/2014,"I came previously and was completely forgotten about, but most of my bill was on the house so I forgot about it...after they mixed up my order and had me wait almost an hour for my meal. Cool. Came in today for take out and with the amount of servers and hostesses waiting around you would think they weren't busy but as the norm apparently is I waited 30 minutes for ONE appetizer.  Y'all need to get it together"
Malika A.,"Dublin, CA",0,80,57,3.0,9/14/2015,Service was much better my last two times visiting. The food is still pretty good. I'm still in it for the Godiva chocolate cheesecake!
Martesha W.,"Hayward, CA",1,18,4,4.0,9/13/2015,My group of five was seated in a less then 30 mins which was awesome food was pretty good nice atmosphere
