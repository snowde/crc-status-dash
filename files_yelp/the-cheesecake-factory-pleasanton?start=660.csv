scott f.,"San Francisco, CA",3,16,,2.0,10/6/2015,"O no! This place is going down hill. Reading other reviews, same experience, pasta dishes not done right served with cold and or uncooked shrimp. Sent back and they ""reheated and added a few shrimps"" and they were again cold! WTF? Manager offered us a free piece of cheesecake for kid's birthday. Insisted on charging us for the shrimp dish, even though it was not edible. What kind of customer service is that? What motivation do I have to come back for that? Manager should be fired for not using his discretion to satisfy unhappy guests. And if that is a company policy, at those prices this place should be left to fail. If you have new cooks, understaffed, fine, that happens, but don't be stingy when you make a mistake and make people wait for raw food for 30 minutes.."
Rafael L.,"Tracy, CA",0,4,2,2.0,6/13/2014,"I've always enjoyed the Cheesecake Factory but tonight the food was disappointing. As always the service was great and our food came out fast. Everything went downhill from there. I ordered the Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp and despite the complex sauce the shrimp tasted like cardboard. The couple next to us struggled to answer our server when asked ""Is everything alright?"" after several pause he said ""yeah."" I'm hoping the Cheesecake makes up for the terrible food we were served."
Sue M.,"Castro Valley, CA",0,3,,1.0,6/30/2016,After waiting 35 minutes to be seated which is pretty standard for this location and not really unreasonable since u can pass the time wondering around Macy's. We were seated and since we had waited so long we had looked at the menu and knew what we wanted. There were 5 of us and guess what they were out of the food to fill 3 of the orders and it was only 7:00 with still a few hours to serve food. Well after we ordered from what food they had it took 45 minutes to get our order. Then adding insult to injury they bring me the wrong order. They offered to correct it but I didn't want to wait another 45 minutes. Disappointing and frustrating experience.
Christine S.,"San Ramon, CA",57,42,82,5.0,5/24/2014,Everyone was so cheerful and sincere we can't believe the attention and first class treatment we received here without reservations and without announcing our occasion ahead of time. The food was awesome--every dish from our appetizer to dessert! Thank you to the staff tonight & especially to Joaquin for taking such good care of us!
lou a.,"Stockton, CA",4,99,24,2.0,3/29/2015,"Starting off with 2 Stars for the Hard bread and near frozen butter...ok my burger just showed up and the special sauce is Ketchup , Really who puts Ketchup on a burger? Wife's food is good to go.."
Regina S.,"Pleasanton, CA",106,208,795,3.0,3/17/2014,"It's the Cheesecake Factory folks , you can buy their cheesecakes at Safeway however I always go here for  Chris's outrageous black out cake (1,000 calories and 500 carbs, lol)  , the perfect blend for a chocolate coconut addict like me ! So delicious ! If I do eat here I get the same thing beet and goat salad and pear / Gorgonzola flatbread. So good !!! I get the same thing at every Cheesecake Factory. If I'm being healthy then I will get the low carb cheesecake.   It's nothing fancy , it in the mall , you will find a ton of non local people , normally the wait is anywhere from 30-60 minutes . Good Luck :)"
Jack P.,"San Ramon, CA",21,318,314,3.0,8/9/2014,"Well these guys just rock with the generous portions crowd and they do a great job.  I actuall ate in the real Cheese Cake factory decades ago in Calabasas, CA on the 2nd floor of the factory when I could eat cheese cake - now older than dirt watching the rich stuff.  My favorite is the Meat Loaf with double spinach, hold the potatoes. Location is in busy mall and always very crowded so it takes the edge of an otherwise great meal by the time you can get seated and get served - not a bad problem from their view I expect, but a bit negative from ours.  Once you seated, gets a lot better."
Courtney C.,"Las Vegas, NV",726,497,1157,5.0,10/31/2010,"yum yum yum! I'm not sure why this restaurant only has 3 stars, it definitely deserves more than that.  The wait is a pretty big deal breaker on some nights but the service is always really good and the food is always hot and delivered relatively quickly. It's also dark sometimes but hey, everyone always has their flashlight app on their iphones anyway. I used to be a salad only girl but I realized but almost everything here is really good! I would recommend any of the salads, the chicken stuffed tortillas, cajun chicken littles, or the lemon herb chicken. All super good choices! I've had the crabcake burger and it actually wasn't that good but it may have been because of the bread..i'm not sure. Anyway, go to Cheesecake factory, definitely worth the time!"
Marissa H.,"Pleasanton, CA",0,2,2,5.0,5/31/2016,My mom has been a waitress my whole life so I know a great one when i see one. It was my first time at The Cheesecake Factory and a wonderful experience. Our waitress Brianna...(not sure of the spelling) was Outstanding. She was personable and always on top of everything. The service was some of the best ive had anywhere! She made my visit special and for that we are sure to return! The food was beautiful and felt authentic. The cheesecake was obviously perfection. 5 out of 5. For sure!
Nas S.,"Livermore, CA",0,4,2,4.0,5/30/2016,"Came to enjoy drinks appetizers and the Warriors game number 7!  Joaquin had exceptional service at the bar area, made sure we had fresh bread and our cups were full. Thank you"
Ashley W.,"San Leandro, CA",293,105,223,3.0,5/30/2014,"If you have been to one, you've been to them all. I came here on Easter and usually not during busy hours so it's not too packed. But the service is still slow, the servers are always nice and friendly but our food literally took years to come out. (I think approximately 45 minutes when there was only 5 tables filled in our section.) The Cheesecake Factory is pretty good with portions, good customer service but I literally could not stand how long it took for my food to come. I always come back for the cheesecake because it's my favorite though (:"
Shopper M.,"Pleasanton, CA",0,1,,1.0,3/4/2015,"Customer for 13 years! Last 2 years coming to this location sadly watching it become HORRIBLE to WORST! Have experienced to name a few:  1. Oct fly floating inside glass water  2. Seated at a tables with last guest dirty plates still on it 3. Long waits before someone comes take order. at times 20-45 mins 4. Restrooms are cleaner at a park than this location most times  5. Sept-brought main course before appetizers without any drinks  6. Wrong orders, cold food, appetizer brought together w main course  7. Sept-raw chicken  8. Insect in chicken plate 9. Dirty silverware 10. Dirty glass still lipstick on ring from previous customer 11. Rude argumentive staff when order is messed up becoming TCF norm  12. Uncook rice  13. Hostesses with attitude and ignore you when you first walk in..guess its a control        game cause we've been only customers standing there 14. Feb- bit sharp object on mash potato cut mouth, than bullied on phone by CF    senior manager! VERY SAD!!! Not once have we complained or asked to speak to management for their incompetent service, but biting into a sharp object and cutting my mouth while eating mash potato from a ""take out order"" seemed severe! Person who answered reassure me manager would call me back as soon as possible that evening and I wasn't asking for free meal just wanting to make sure he knew and hopes to prevent it from happening to another customer.  That was saturday today three days later still no call so I decide to call again today. Big mistake! Senior manger Al was insulting, combative, condescending arguing with himself cause he didn't allow me to speak after I had explained purpose of my call..felt as if I was in court and already guilty!  He said ""he wanted to compare time of incident to check if he had received any other complaints of sharp objects in mash potatoes. REALLY? Guess this incident happens often on your watch huh?  This mouthy incompetent manager challenged me to bring him receipt, dr's note!! Mr Al going to ER on saturday night cost thousands sorry you can't comprehend that or think ahead just run your mouth...And than what? Go fight in the parking lot? Cause I got the impression your only mouthy over the phone but are lacking management and people skills! Still not sure how this was turned into a low class street brawl over the phone with a mouthy BULLIE AL SENOIR MANAGER!! SAD to watch CHEESECAKE FACTORY be run DOWNHILL... As a frequent Cheesecake Factory customer its DISGUSTING/ HORRIFYING to hear TCF  senior manager make such statement,..sounds as this is something that happens on a regular basis..  BEWARE  Next time dining or order take our at TCF in Pleasanton when biting into food you might just cut your mouth with sharp objects in food...than get bullied by the Combative, Incompetent Argumentative management! Don't blame the poor staff/employees either for not caring to do their job well or at all! cause it all reflects on management! And it's obvious just like 1+2 =3  However don't think Cheesecake Factory would hire someone without people skills so I'm hoping this Al ""senior manager"" was having a very bad a day or week! If not I assume he hates his job and in the process taking this Cheesecake Factory location down with him!  Might be why he don't give a dam for the safety or what goes in food his customers are eating when dining at this location.  I""M SHOCKED at MANAGEMENT!"

Melissa M.,"Newark, CA",54,103,127,4.0,3/30/2014,"The Cheesecake Factory has a great balance of good desserts and entreés, unlike many restaurants where it's either good at one or the other. Pros: + complimentary bread to munch on as you wait for your order + generous portion sizes + lots of yummy entreés to choose from + lots of yummy desserts to choose from + lots of drinks to choose from Cons: - food and drinks are pricey - most of the food is really high in calories - I've discovered grease puddles under my pasta - almost always busy; doesn't take reservations - servers may not be as attentive depending on how busy the restaurant is - restaurant is a little on the noisy side While Marie Callender's also does a great job with their pies, I'd give The Cheesecake Factory the edge just because they have a bigger menu."
Bruce F.,"Dublin, CA",68,85,29,2.0,11/27/2012,So I eat here all the time and normally it's great food takes a long time but its always good. I was with three people they brought out the two people I was with their food and I kept waiting thinking it was going to come and it never came and so I asked about it and by now the rest of my party has eaten half there food and then when I comes out they're like 75% done and then the order was wrong!!! The manager gave me the food for free for the mess up but on top of that our waitress was being very rude to us about the situation.  So normally the foods good and the service but today they had an off day.
Liz F.,"Dublin, CA",2,9,,1.0,12/7/2013,"I couldn't decide if I was at the zoo or at a football game when I went to Cheesecake at Stoneridge mall. Wild animals and vultures swoop tables at the bar, and linebackers tackle your ass for a table.  My girlfriends and I were greeted with a 90 minute wait but were told there was free seating at the bar. We waited patiently and just as a table at the bar cleared and we were about to claim it, a waiter pushed us aside and assured us that he would get that table for us. Well, nano seconds later, a mother daughter vulture team, swooped our promised table. Here's the deal Cheesecake, don't promise a table if you can't deliver.  We spoke to the manager who moved us to another area of the bar, where someone who looked like a defensive lineman frothing at the mouth, paced the floor, and was ready to pounce on the next available table. What the hell? I didn't come ready to run the 100 under 6 seconds just to get a table.  The manager, RaeAnn, then told us to stand next to a table of unsuspecting lovers who were finishing up their dessert.  My mama didn't raise me to be a vulture who circles a barely breathing carcass, in wait. I mean, let the lovebirds finish their cheesecake covered in chocolate and caramel in peace!   Overall,  waiter was a liar, and manager was rather useless and could care less about her patrons. I can't comment on the food  as we took our business elsewhere.  Mental note, next time I want to dine at Cheesecake, I'll bring my cleats, and shoulder pads."
Flo T.,"East Bay, CA",13,117,471,4.0,12/18/2012,"The food is always good here, at any location really because it's the same menu. The seating at the tables are quite close together so you feel like you might be a little squished but once you're engaged in your own conversation you just drone out the people who are inches away from you.  They also have a happy hour-mostly fried items so if that's what you like this is the time for you to go. For me, it gets tiring because it's pretty much all the same and then you get so thirsty-maybe that's why they only serve fried foods? So you drink more... It's convenient when you're shopping at Stoneridge Mall to come here for lunch or dinner. It is located next to Macy's Women. The parking can be a bit tough when it's a weekend because either everyone is trying to eat here or everyone's shopping. Beware when it's the holiday season. You will never find parking!"
Christina R.,"Union City, CA",26,54,133,4.0,6/15/2014,"Of course the food here is good, a little something for everybody. Even the small plates & snacks and appetizers make a good meal, my favorite is the buffalo blast but the chicken samosas are also very good. The regular meal portions are generous and make great leftovers but if you have a smaller appetite the lunch portion meals are served til 5:00 pm and are sized just right. The crusted chicken Romano is so good (and is also available in the lunch portion), the chicken Madeira is also a favorite. Save room for dessert! Too many desserts to choose from, pick a couple and share. Bon appetit!"
Mig Z.,"Patterson, CA",78,4,49,2.0,9/1/2015,Food was great but once again service was terrible!  I always tip 15%. Maybe it's time to reconsider!!
Scott W.,"Rohnert Park, CA",0,7,,1.0,9/27/2015,"Long weekend and looking forward to a good dinner on our way home from a tournament. Cheesecake Factory is usually a good call after long weekends on the road. Bad choice. First time at the CF at Stoneridge Mall in Dublin. I'll try and keep this quick...  Started with one server and ended with another. Took 45 min for appetizers (server let us know that they're really short staffed... Really...). Additional 30 min for entrees except for mine because it was accidentally served to a different table. ""I'll have a new one out to you in 7 minutes, stated server two.  By the way would the rest of you like Parmesan cheese with your pasta?  Yes? I'll be right back"".  Came back 25 minutes later with my pasta and no cheese for the family as they're now ready for to-go boxes.  Food was bland and nowhere near spec for their brand.  Left 15% tip. This is the lowest tip I've left in 10 years in a restaurant. I spent many years in the restaurant business as a server, bartender and owner. My gut says when the server said they were short staffed she meant the management. We waited 45 minutes to be seated. Not a big deal if it's worth it, but I feel I lost about 2.5 hours of my life that I'll never get back.  The one star if for what was stated plus some I left out (no need for grab ass at the host desk between employees)."
