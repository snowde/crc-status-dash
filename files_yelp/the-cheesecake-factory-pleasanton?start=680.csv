Tiffany Michelle L.,"Fremont, CA",298,243,471,4.0,2/16/2014,"Mostly, I have been to the Stevens Creek Valley Fair and the Blossom Hill Mall Cheesecake Factory in San Jose. I've been to those ones a lot compared to probably any other restaurant in the past two years few years. When I walked inside the layout was slightly different which I guess is the norm for the Cheesecake Factory it has a slightly different layout however the same look the same materials were used in making the inside and outside probably. Oh I guess I'll also been to the Palo Alto Cheesecake Factory 2 times. This Cheesecake Factory hss dim lighting than usual it seemed, but I guess that adds to the romantic ambience of the restaurant.  So we got there late about 10:30 p.m. on a weekday. It was definitely not busy I assume that this Cheesecake Factory is probably not that busy during nights as compared to the first two locations I listed. We were seated right away the hostess was nice, and the waiter came shortly after I took our order, he was nice. I would have liked it if he would have cleared the dishes of the table more quicker but other than that he was actually helpful. I had ordered a Moroccan Chicken plate and I really like the sauce and so he actually was willing to you get more sauce to-go and he went and got more sauce and he ended up giving me a lot extra than I would have wanted or needed, but I like that sauce. When my boyfriend asked what would be a good dish to order he recommended on the the Jambalaya Pasta which was pretty good, and I tried both, I had had the Moroccan Chicken before, one that I guess I seem to order pretty regularly. I've noticed in the last few years that the size of the dishes at Cheesecake Factory's have become slightly smaller but however still quite large portions are usually about 2-3 portions per plate. My guy finished his whole plate, but I still feel like it was a good size portion. The Jambalaya Pasta was supposed to be maybe one of the spiciest or hottest  pasta according to the waiter and my guy asked for more red pepper, but for me it was definitely a spicy enough. For dessert we ordered a white chocolate raspberry cheesecake which was delicious, too."
Courtney M.,"Livermore, CA",82,77,43,3.0,4/24/2015,Enjoyed happy hour this past Wednesday at CF. 4 star service 4 star environment 3 star food 3 star key lime cheesecake = 3.5 stars Now that you've done your math for the day... The menu may look overwhelming due to what seems like endless options but at closer look - it's mostly chicken.  This place is a chicken pushing factory! Complimentary bread (2 options) and butter were appreciated Hot spinach dip w/ artichoke hearts was good.  The app came with a cheesecake factory portion of chips and included guac and sour cream on side. Tex Mex egg rolls weren't as delicious as I remembered.  Wish I could undo ordering those.  They were lacking flavor.  You know what made up for it?  The ahi tartare!  By far the best item ordered!  I'd come back for this item and drinks.  Hubby got their grilled fish tacos- comes with three tacos rice & beans. We got the key lime cheesecake to go and questioned later if it was key lime-wanted more tart or bitter key lime flavor.
Anne R.,"Hercules, CA",5000,829,322,3.0,2/1/2012,I am not sure what is up with the staff at the Cheesecake Factory. Like they are all SUPER slow when they work there. Not only at this location but I noticed the same thing at the S.F location as well. They take forever to take your order and it seems like they ask to refill your drink when THEY want and not when you need it.  Although this location is very nice compared to the one is S.F. I guess you go here if you aren't in a huge rush to be anywhere else after or if you aren't starving to eat. Because trust me you will be waiting a long while!
Josh L.,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",28,276,71,2.0,4/15/2012,"Came here to pick up a cake that we per-ordered over the phone. We arrived to pick up the cake and had to wait for the one of the servers to put everything together. While we were watching the server put our toppings (whip cream, cherries, almonds) into containers, we noticed she dropped a cherry on the counter and put it back into the container... Is the counter that clean to eat off of?! Calling in ahead of time to order a cake is useless, since you will be forced to wait as if you walked in and ordered it."
James T.,"Alameda, CA",6,207,58,5.0,8/25/2012,Love this place.  Used to come here at least once a month when I lived close.  I liked the fact that when they make a mistake they acknowledge and take care of the situation.  Food is always yummy.  You can tell management takes care of their employees.  For the most part the employees always seem happy and eager to be there.  Waits can be crazy if you go during peak dinner times. I should give them a -1 for over the top prices for their cheesecake but I never save room for dessert anyways.
Louis W.,"Alameda, CA",66,147,43,1.0,5/25/2015,"I'm here right now as I'm writing this review while having lunch with my family of 4. We ordered 4 drinks, avocado egg rolls, 2 pizzas , a lettuce wrap and a angel hair pasta. Also the americano burger. After the house bread was given then come the drinks, after that we saw our avocado egg rolls was deliver to the next table, then the lady next table said they didn't order it... The waitress looks confuse and said ... You sure you didn't order it?? Then I have to tell her that ""we ordered"" it. Then she continue to give me a confuse looks said you ""sure"" you order it?? I'm a bit tick off at this point... You didn't check the tag before you bring it out?? Btw, our original waiter is a guy and this is a girl who bring out the orders. Now my shrimp angel hair pasta just came out and I asked for extra sauce when I ordered and it came out completely dry and I have to ask for more sauce (see pic that I will post later) come on now... I know it's a holiday but can you take the right orders and bring out ordered correctly ??? They bring out the burger with no fries... So now we have to ask for it... I won't even continue rest of the story as we will just eat and get out of here... Management, hope you train your staffs better!"
Jimmy R.,"Oakland, CA",0,1,,1.0,5/15/2016,"Terrible service, my gf had to go to the front desk after being seated for 17 minutes so that we can get something to drink . Five minutes after that our server came we ordered our appetizers and entrees together to avoid waiting another 20 mins for our server, our appetizers came and about 30 mins after that we were told that our entrees had been sitting at the window since they brought over the appetizers and if we wanted them still lol we took the check instead."
Miss H K.,"San Francisco, CA",446,959,1946,4.0,3/4/2012,Came here today to celebrate my brother's birthday. Had a nice lunch and a friendly server.  I had the macadamia nut chicken with a soy glaze and veggies. The dish was very good and was a special not on the menu. The chicken was tasty and had good flavor.  Also had Lisa's Fudge Cake for dessert- was rich and moist...it was lovely! Overall the last few times I have been here I have enjoyed my dining experience. The wait can be long but as long as you get here either for an early lunch or dinner then it shouldn't be too long.  Also check out their skinnylicious menu that has options under 500calories.
Harmony D.,"Newman, CA",0,70,34,4.0,6/5/2014,"Bar: We sat at the bar on a very busy Saturday afternoon. John the bartender was super nice and helpful.  Told me about some of the drinks he was making that looked fabulous. I tried the pineapple mojito, and wow! Was it delicious! Service: We ordered our food and were squished because a lady had stuck an extra chair at the bar. During our entire visit, her wine glass, dishes and the chair  remained.  When our bread came, we asked 2 different people for plates and silverware, one disappeared, the other brought plates, and had to come back with utensils.  After the people next to us had left, new ones came and ordered, then we're served. We finally looked for John, to ask where our food was, he was actually in the kitchen trying to find it.  Food: My husband ordered probably one of the simplest items on the menu, nachos, no chicken. When they F-I-N-A-L-L-Y came out, they were with chicken, and burnt to a dark brown crisp. I don't even see how that is possible!  So of course they went back.  My chicken Madeira was fantastic, perfect even, I actually got the extra sauce that I always request, and never get. So, at Hubby's insistence, I ate my hot food while hot. He waited. When I was done, and the people next to us, who were seated a good 20 minutes after us, had appetizers, drinks, dinner then had ordered dessert and were finishing it, my husband still hadn't gotten his nachos. They finally came out, a bit burnt on the edges, but edible for the most part. So our quick dinner had turned into a fiasco.  We always enjoy our food here, service is either top notch, normally we sit at the bar, you have someone literally standing there who can help you. (Salt, pepper, butter, water, napkins...) or spotty, at seats, you see someone and then they disappear. Then they mess up the order.  Our trip this time was wonderful regarding John, our bartender, he was nice, polite and man was he moving nonstop in the hot sun! However it stunk in service and the quality of the one dish."
Matthew A.,"Dublin, CA",118,266,641,3.0,9/23/2012,"Had lunch here today with the fam. What was ordered: Appetizer - crispy crab bites Mushroom burger w/ fries White chocolate caramel macadamia nut cheesecake Red Velvet cheesecake ...and some other plates. The last 2 times we came here we left because the wait was over an hour.  Today we sat and ate finally! The waiter was friendly.  However, I had to ask for a water refill - I hate that!  The mushroom burger had a sauce on it that was too sweet.  I felt rushed to eat it quickly for fear that the bun would get too soggy because of that sweet sauce...ugh.  My fries were already cold when they served me my plate - this sucks but I didn't complain like I should have. Cheesecakes were ordered at the end of the meal - they took forever bringing them out...sheesh.  The cheesecake slices are not cheap.  They do have the best selection of cheesecakes in the area though.   I would recommend this place - Bring plenty of money and be prepared to wait to be seated...trust me."
Veronica A.,"Union City, CA",278,898,384,4.0,1/17/2014,"The wait time to get seated here is absolutely ridiculous!  However, the food is pretty good and the service has always been great.  And for those reasons we continue to come back :D"
Gerardo R.,"San Leandro, CA",0,8,,2.0,4/23/2016,"I start off by saying that my rating of a two stars because of the horrible service. The cheesecake is amazing. There's no arguing that. I came in and ordered a full cheescake right around opening time. I was waiting for a while, and I saw people come in after me, and get their order first. Since they were large, I assumed they ordered ahead of time, and just came to pick up their items. After 30 minutes, I decided that I'll ask what the hold up was. They asked me my name, and I told them. They clearly hadn't even started my order because I could see everything behind the counter as it is not that big. I sat down and waited another 10 minutes and decided that enough was enough. I went to the counter, and asked what continued to be the hold up because I had somewhere to be, and they told me that they're whip cream machine wasn't working!!! I was pretty furious. I just told them to give me my cheesecake, and I'd leave without the whipped cream. I was extremely disappointed because it took 40 minutes to get a cheesecake without whipped cream."
Consuela M.,"San Francisco, CA",20,87,67,1.0,3/5/2015,We went in to have a quick drink while waiting for our appointment at the Apple Store.  We sat at the bar and waited and waited.... The bartender nor his assistant ever even acknowledged us.  We turned and left.  Do yourself a favor and go next door to PF Changs.
Diana G.,"Dublin, CA",69,85,9,4.0,6/29/2015,"Ordered the Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake for a special event. It's Gluten Free and it was yummy! Im not a cheesecake person, but this was GOOD! I don't think the guests even knew it was gluten free. LOL! It was pricey..."
Zech F.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,29,6,3.0,6/28/2015,"Food was consistent as is the case with Cheesecake Factory, unfortunately the service was not good. :-/ Waitress was simply not very friendly or attentive and she had way too many tables so everything from our initial greet to getting our check took way too long."
Pompy B.,"Fremont, CA",2,34,10,3.0,7/25/2015,Extra long wait to not only get a table but also for the food! No silverware or plate when bread was served.
J G.,"Concord, CA",0,59,2,2.0,2/23/2015,You were a party of three. The other two people in my group receive their food and I had to wait an additional 20 minutes.  Apparently they made the wrong dish first.  The manager comes over and apologizes and since everyone was done eating I told her to box up. Do you think she mentioned some kind of discount for having me wait 45 minutes for my food? No. No comp no discount not even a free slice of cheesecake. Customer service mediocrity at its finest.
Tom H.,"North Providence, RI",1,10,,1.0,5/22/2016,"Water glasses came out dirty, then just as our food came out the table next to us had a cockroach crawl over it, we all left after.  Manager came by and assured us they spray every month for them.  Not a huge fan of cockroaches or insecticides near my food. They didn't offer a discount or anything."
Gary O.,"San Ramon, CA",4,32,13,2.0,7/17/2014,"I used to really like cheesecake factory We haven't been in a while and it didnt live up to my memories the service is ridiculously slow,  after being sat down the wait to get a drink was really long, then they mess up the order so after 30 minutes they finally finish the drinks food did take a while also, then your server doesn't even bring your food so when they mess it up you can't even complain to someone that cares.  Overall experience wasn't good"
Geoff S.,"San Ramon, CA",0,3,,1.0,3/1/2015,"This is a great place to eat if you want to waste a few hours waiting. We were told 30-40 minutes. Waited 1:30 hours. This was at 2pm. We would have left had we known it would take more than an hour, but that's not what we were told. Be realistic about the wait Cheesecake Factory."
