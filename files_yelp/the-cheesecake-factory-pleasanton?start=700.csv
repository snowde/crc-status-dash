Rahat S.,"San Ramon, CA",0,17,,1.0,5/1/2016,The wait was super long....to be honest that's expected....but what's worse was after the wait....they served the wrong dish. HORRIBLE SERVICE.
Nick V.,"San Ramon, CA",224,81,2,3.0,2/13/2014,"I've been to this location several times, mostly because of the proximity to my house. I don't order a whole wide variety of stuff, but generally the food is cooked pretty well. There have been occasions where the pasta I have gotten wasn't seasoned properly, but no complaints about food other than that. The portions are good for the value.  Drinks are another thing though. The fountain drinks are fountain drinks, not much you can say about that. The lemonade is like a touch (or several touches) too sweet. Most of the drinks I've ordered from the bar were on the strong side, not that I'm complaining, but it's nice to have that balance...especially for those who don't enjoy a heavy-alcohol taste.  Not much to say in the decor department since all locations are pretty much the same. This place can get pretty loud and echo-y because of the tile floors and the deep ceilings. I would avoid this place during peak lunch/dinner hours, you could be waiting for 30+ minutes just to get a table. With the mall being next door, you could probably kill some time during the long wait, but I doubt the buzzer would work from all the way inside the mall.  I usually end up spending $15-20 to eat here. Which I find to be worth it, since I generally visit this place once every few months."
Saurabh M.,"Pleasanton, CA",36,6,1,5.0,7/12/2014,We are so happy with almost all the food on the menu and there are so many choices that you can go more than dozen times without eating the same again. The servers are very polite and prompt And of course at the end of each of our dates is a slice of great cheesecake  Best place to go for a great meal
Christopher P.,"Sunol, CA",143,55,6,3.0,11/9/2013,"A group of 7 of us (6 adults, 1 child) went there last night for dinner.  There was about a 30 minute wait, which was expected and no big deal - it was a Friday night.  We walked around the mall and got back right as our buzzer started going off.     Hostess sat us - Super friendly and interacted with our little one.  Server came by, we ordered our drinks and ordered 2 appetizers - Sweet Corn Tamales and Wings.  The Wings were SPICY, but they did say they were hot wings so that was expected.  The chicken however was overcooked and dry.  Made it hard to enjoy.  Order our food, drink refills keep coming, food arrives.  But the food arrives one plate at a time, with as much as a 5 minute gap in between plates.  We finally receive all of our dishes and the kids meal is brought.  The plate is PIPING HOT.  This is a big problem for me.  I understand why the plate is hot - they may use a plate warmer, the food may have been waiting in the window before it was ran to our table - but it's a children's plate... shouldn't they take precautions to not bring out a plate so hot that it can't be handled?   I ordered some pasta with shrimp.  Shrimp = Overcooked.  The shrimp from Panda Express was prepared better.  My brother ordered a caesar salad.  Dressing = Mayonnaise.   Overall, we had a good time, our cheesecakes were good, the server was attentive and friendly.  Just some issues with the food."
Carlos G.,"Hayward, CA",109,8,3,1.0,9/22/2015,"Worst Cheesecake Factory I've ever been too. It was Monday night and they were pretty slow. They still managed to screw up my order. I never received my food, after everyone in my party was done eating they finally decided to come check on us. I told them I never received my food and they went to check on it. Turns out they forgot my order. They asked if I still wanted it which I refused, then asked if I would like it to go which I also refused. The worst part after ruining my night they only offered us one free cheesecake slice. I will never go back there again, if you don't like bad service do not come here. Worst experience at a restaurant in my life."
Caroline C.,"Hayward, CA",3,8,6,5.0,8/12/2015,"There's almost always a wait, but that's what happens when the food is quality. This place is definitely pricier than the usual restaurant. Most of the options are at LEAST $15-$16, and the more tasty selections can be around $20. Their brown bread is my ABSOLUTE FAVORITE, nothing can compare! I always get their pasta, it's seriously so delicious and creamy. I've gotten a glam burger once, and there was fried mac n cheese balls inside. Absolutely amazing. Their portions are pretty big, too! I usually load up on brown bread because I get too overexcited, and then when my entree comes I can barely finish half. At least I have leftovers for lunch the next day hehe :)"
Mason A.,"Tracy, CA",0,4,2,4.0,8/11/2014,"Went with coworkers, and overall I had a great time!  We got the buffalo blast for an appetizer which was delicious.  I got the fried Mac and cheese cheeseburger, also very good.  Great selection of cheesecake as well!"
Steve T.,"Brentwood, CA",0,9,,2.0,12/30/2015,"We got here at 11 am sharp, opening time. Almost An hour wait for party of 9 to be seated despite about half the tables were empty (they were too small for a large party, but numerous others were waiting as well).Zoom forward.  It's now 10 to 1 pm and everyone at our table got their food 10 minutes ago ( that's correct, another 45+ minute wait at the table) and I still have none. Waitress has been nice, doing a good job. Manager apologized, comped meal, but still no food.  Food just arrived 1:05, almost 15 minutes after food for others arrived. They were mostly done eating so I ate while they watched. I ordered steak tacos. Comes with rice and beans. Both of which were barely warm. Tacos were quite good. Fresh and hot. All the others in our party said the food was great. Once again, our waitress was great. I feel bad for the waitress and manager. I'm not in the food business, so all I can do is guess. I think what may have happened is some of the kitchen staff didn't show up or they just can't find enough. I'm guessing why half the tables were empty yet people were waiting is because they wouldn't have been able to cook enough for all the tables. That is reinforced by the time we waited for food. I've eaten here before and everything was excellent. So again, my guess, they were swamped and didn't have enough kitchen staff. Caught off guard if you will. They had plenty of wait staff. The manager was running around like crazy, so I should give her, and the rest the benefit of doubt and chalk it up to a bad day. Everyone is entitled to that once in awhile. Judging by the huge crowd still there when we left they must be good the majority of the time. Would I eat there again? Certainly. One bad experience is not enough to write off a place."
Kay A.,"Fremont, CA",42,156,102,4.0,5/3/2012,"Love The Cheesecake Factory. The good is always great here. I have tried a ton of stuff including the wild mushroom burger (super gourmet), they chicken madiera (yummy!), the pizzas, advacado egg rolls, bang bang chicken, buffalo blast bites, etc...it is all excellent!     And if course the desserts are phenomenal! Especially anything with their hot fudge on it! A ++++++"
Lora M.,"San Francisco, CA",179,417,1126,3.0,6/20/2012,"My pair was craving for salad that day, someone needed a digestive cleansing. I wasn't so hungry, so I let him picked the place. For what he craved for, he did picked the right place because he seemed to have enjoyed his Cob Salad. I ordered the Ahi Carpaccio, it was alright. It sounded delicious on the menu: Thin Slices of Raw Ahi Tuna, Wasabi Pesto, Creamy Avocado and Togarashi Aioli but flavor-wise am not very crazy about it. I did enjoyed the cocktail.  Service is usually better at the bar area."
Cashea A.,"Burlingame, CA",0,2,,1.0,2/7/2015,"love Cheesecake Factory, hate this location. I waited 40 minutes for takeout that I'd ordered way in advance. #utterlyridiculous"
Jimmy W.,"Pleasanton, CA",0,69,,1.0,8/2/2015,"Went there on Saturday night around 9pm, got seated around 9:30. - took 10 minutes to be acknowledged - 20 minutes gone by no-one brought water nor bread - 5 minutes later waiter brought bread but still no water - ice tea never refilled, pasta did not come with a spoon nor offer of parmesan The waiter is in-experienced, talked to manager but got lip service(I will check on your food).  The couple next to our table left after 20 minutes without eating. A complete disaster."
Krissy A.,"Oakland, CA",4,117,7,1.0,11/15/2014,"I WILL NEVER EAT HERE AGAIN!  I experienced the worst service in a long time. Server came off as nice and very attentive but boy was she bad. My lunch date originally wanted the Louisiana cajun pasta but changed her mind to chicken piccata during the order process. She asked about sides and the waitress went on and on about the homemade mashed potatoes as a substitution for the angel-hair pasta. We waited over 20 minutes for our food and when mine came the fries were cold. When my lunch dates food came it was Louisiana Cajun pasta and not the chicken piccata. My lunch date was nice about it and gently tried to correct the server but she had the nerve to argue and INSIST that she take the pasta dish.  After some back and forth, she brings the Cajun pasta out and my friend wouldn't accept it. Instead of apologizing for the error she got defensive. Luckily her shift ended and we got another server, after convincing my friend to get SOMETHING I asked for a manager. The new server gives us some story that they were in a meeting and my friend finally gets what she originally wanted and it came relatively quickly.  Typical chain restaurant. The 1st server was clearly wrong and if she had listened the first time, there would have been no problem. Instead of just getting her what she originally wanted instead of being a smart-a** it would have been all good. Absolutely ridiculous and out of order. I know there was a manager on the floor, but the 2nd server probably didn't want her friend to get in trouble. If I ever eat at this chain restaurant again it will be the one is San Francisco. TWO thumbs down!"
Felipe M.,"Ceres, CA",0,5,,1.0,7/31/2015,Food was greasy and overcooked. The so allied manager Carolina was rude and apparently bothered by having to talk to us about our horribly cooked dinner. Epic failure for such a sophisticated restaurant. Definitely would not recommend coming back to this location again.
Joseph Y.,"Sunnyvale, CA",786,55,,5.0,3/1/2015,"Our server was awesome. She gave us tips about the food, made sure my friend's kids enjoyed their Mac and Cheese, and she even told us cheaper ways to get Legos. 5 stars for the service."
Priya G.,"Fremont, CA",439,231,11,5.0,10/8/2013,"Been here a million times and have had so many of the dishes that this yelp review won't really do justice. The menu is so so so big that it's hard to cover, but let's just say this-- you can pretty much find anything you want on the menu! Pizzas, pastas, salads, seafood, Asian, Mexican, you name it --they have everything. I come here a lot for lunch, and they're really good about their lunch specials. You can get pretty much any of the above things I named in some form for $10, whether it be a lunch sized pasta, pizza, soup/salad, or salmon dish. The complimentary bread is always a steal, of course, and I find the staff at all Cheesecake Factories to be super nice and friendly. The decor is nice, the restaurant is clean, and like I said - you can find anything you want here, really. Great for both veg and non-veg people. Their cheesecakes are also excellent!! Love this place, would come back a million times!"
Lauren R.,"Livermore, CA",35,225,9,3.0,7/26/2013,"We rarely come to The Cheesecake Factory because I usually have no desire to wait an hour for mediocre food. The stars aligned due to my husband working from home today,  I needed to go to the mall anyways, and a piece of red velvet cheesecake sounding pretty damn good. We got there around 5pm and there wasn't a wait. The place was still very busy. And loud! Man, I feel like I had to shout to have a conversation which was super annoying. The menu is enormous as I'm sure everyone knows. I ordered a farro salad, which I didn't think specified cheese being on it on the menu. I was sort of dazed anyway, so I might have completely missed it. I ended up picking it off. The salad was small, but I wasn't too hungry. The bread they bring you is freaking delicious.  Our server was okay. It was obvious they were trying to turn tables. The food came out very quick and I felt rushed. She brought our check without offering any cheesecake! I came here specifically for the cheesecake, woman! I just felt obligated to have a salad first. So, we get a piece to go and pay our check. I think we were done in about an hour.  I think it might be another few years before I make it back.  P.S. It is so cold in that restaurant. I was literally shivering.  P.P.S. I'm done complaining now."
Sergio G.,"Castro Valley, CA",506,582,1798,5.0,8/12/2011,"Baby Sara was so so excited to choose where she wanted to eat and she chose to come here to the Cheesecake Factory.  As we arrived around 7:45 the lobby was packed and the host said it would be about a 40 min wait. Took a deep breath & said  "" Sure not a problem ""  I mentioned it was Sara's Birthday and I guess that brought us good luck. We were called by name 25 min later ahead of other parties that were waiting but did I complain? Heck No!!!!!  We ordered 2 bowels of Clam Chowder that came out pretty quick and Sofia & I almost licked the bowels clean a few minutes later.  Sara ordered the Filet Mignon ( regular size @ $29.99 ) I can forget about the kids menu for sure. She didn't want crayons or nothing, she wants to act like she's an adult so we go with the flow for now. The steak was cooked perfect to her choice of Med Well and had tons of fries with that as well.  Sofia also went on the big people's menu and had a Classic burger w/ fries... Dude that was frickin humongous !!!!!!!!!!  The accountant had the Chicken Bellagio  which comes with pasta noodles and is saute with butter and Basil. The taste was actually pretty damm good will be on my list next time we go.  I had the "" Orange Chicken "" serviced w/ veggies and white rice. The serving was huge and there was more than enough white rice. The taste of the chicken was smooth and yummylicious!!!!!!!  The Lemonades also rock,,, great flavor and top of the glass laced with sugar and we were all too full for Desert...... :-( Our waiter was Auggie ( Agustin ) is his legal name but he was cool We had a blast and they sang Happy Birthday to Baby Sara  & the price was very reasonable $103.00 with + $17,00 Tip"
Lina L.,"Danville, CA",2,2,,1.0,10/15/2016,"this place is terrible!! It's took forever for our table to come, and when they texted me to come, they made me wait another 30 mins. This has taken 2 hours and a 45 minutes for us. Every half hour they made me check in, and then told me our table still wasn't ready. I am never coming back here. Terrible service, the hosts were incredibly rude and obnoxious. It took us 40 minutes to get out waters, and we had to remind them a million times. Then it took then a million years to give us menus and serve us. The food was mediocre and bland. The food took forever to come, and the service was even worse. I am extremely shocked by the rudeness of our host. I was so angry, I do not think I will be back here anymore ever again. It was even more annoying when they called our table and then made us wait another 10 minutes until they actually seated us. Overall, terrible service + long wait time + bland food = never coming back here again"
Carrie M.,"Hayward, CA",41,39,11,4.0,4/25/2015,"I had the Ahi Tuna Tartare, OMG Soooo good!!! I wanted to lick the bowl. Service is good, very busy & loud. There is seating outside for those who prefer alfresco!"
