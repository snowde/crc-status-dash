C F.,"Pleasanton, CA",40,40,11,4.0,5/17/2014,Love this place! But if you are hungry be prepared to wait. They have a variety of options for everyone and it is a great environment.  Some servers are better than others but that is everywhere. And as everyone knows the deserts are yummy! Hard to come here when your on a diet but I have become a fan of the Chinese chicken salad. This location by far has been the best that I have gone to in the bay area
Lynn P.,"Livermore, CA",2,11,,2.0,5/3/2016,"The food is good, but the wait, the wait! We were a party of 8 and were quoted a wait time of 3 1/2 to 4 hours! Why don't they take reservations for large parties?"
Kelly V.,"Livermore, CA",56,11,1,4.0,1/12/2015,To be honest cheesecake factory can be super hit or miss as far as the food goes but I happen to come in on a Friday during lunch with a friend and we sat on the patio our server was Mark and he was very kind super attentive and just gave us great service! Had a great lunch and when I go back I'll be sure to ask for him as should you!
Nancy B.,"San Leandro, CA",6,44,2,5.0,4/18/2014,Food Chicken & Shrimp Cajun Pasta with a Strawberry Lemonade mmmm ;)  Dessert Lyndas Fudge Cake BOMB!!! Was very good plus the bread and butter even better and the service was very friendly.  The wait was about 30 minutes to be seated not so bad was worth the wait. Restrooms were neat and clean. Definitely will return and recommend it.
Tammy T.,"Fremont, CA",101,9,3,2.0,6/29/2016,"We recently visited your facility and the food was okay & the wait for the table was a little less then estimated.  But visiting your restroom was a disaster.  There was even a dirty apron hanging in the stall that I used.  The restroom was a mess.  While the food was okay, the wait was long.  We were a party of 5 and each meal came out slowly.  We had to tell the first ones to start eating so their food would not get cold.  By the time the 5th meal (a hamburger & fires) was delivered the others were more then half way through their meal.  I must admit that this really surprised me as we enjoy going to your place for lunch and dinner when in the area.  We were just surprised at how slow the food service was and what a mess the bathroom (womans) was.  It was quite the disappointment and we will think twice before coming back.  I'm sorry but when we go out as a family of 5-6, we expect to eat at the same time."
Mikol B.,"Oakland, CA",0,2,,1.0,6/3/2015,The wait was 20 minutes and after waiting for another 15 to order our food came 30 minutes later  I ordered the chicken Madeira without the cheese they bring this breaded chicken breast  that was not sautéed and some green things that didn't look like  asparagus and the manager comes over to me and says its sautéed in egg batter and if I ever had this dish before (yes) and its was sautéed before the mash potatoes were iced cold and the server could care less then they go to remake it and I am still waiting 50 minutes later will not ever return here
Michelle J.,"Oakland, CA",156,41,8,2.0,7/28/2013,"I love Cheesecake Factory. Really, I do. I just REALLY REALLY REALLY dislike this location. That being said it gets 2 stars because the cheesecake/food is still on point and the manager (?) at this location on 7/27 was the business, but everything else was meh or worse. First - got there Saturday night about 5:15. Normally, when I go to the Cheesecake Factory in Walnut Creek (run from Pleasanton to WC, trust me) at that time I am seated almost immediately. At this location though, our party of 4 had to wait. We were told it wouod be about 20 minutes. It was me, the hubs, our 5 year old and our 1 year old (and all of us were starving). It was not 20 minutes. It was 30+ minutes. I think the fact we had to wait so long (and had to wait at all) is because this location is TINY. The sign said capacity of 360-ish, but compared to all other Cheesecake Factories I''ve been to (at least 4 others), this one was definitely the smallest by far. When we were finally seated we were told that they did not have a high chair for my one year old. They only have 5 in the whole restaurant. Really? A big company like CF only has 5 high chairs in the restaurant. I have literally been to mom and pop hole in wall types places with more than 5 high chairs in the restaurant. The woman who seated us was not particularly helpful or apologetic about it either. If you've ever tried to eat out with an infant and no high chair, it is next to impossible.  When our waiter came to the table we told him about the high chair situation and he was not all that helpful either. It was so bad my husband planned to get up and scout out a high chair after we had our orders taken. AND our waiter clearly did not care about us. He kept saying, ""I'll be with you in a minute"" in favor of talking to other tables. Maybe he figured since we had kids we would not be getting liquored up (true) or ordering super expensive meals (also true), but that does not excuse bad service. After our order was taken a manager walked by and my husband flagged him down. We explained the high chair situation and the manager, who showed genuine concern for our situation said he'd be back. About 5 minutes later he showed up with a high chair. Thank the lord we saw him and he helped us out. If we left it up to the hostess or the waiter my son would have sat in our laps while we ate dinner. My husband actually saw them pushing out high chairs from a storage room so it was clear they actually had more than 5 high chairs but someone was too lazy to ask where they were (thanks for nothing hostess and waiter).  Aside from this high chair debacle and the lame waiter everything else was fine. I just know I will NEVER EVER EVER EVER eat at this location again. I would definitely get cheesecake to go, but if I want to eat at the Cheesecake Factory it will not be this location. Go to Walnut Creek, SF or San Mateo. Forget this place."
Susie D.,"Livermore, CA",0,37,,4.0,8/9/2015,"Very nice ambiance, good service, and good food.  The menu is extensive.  I'd give 5 stars if it was a little less pricey."
Roger C.,"Tracy, CA",0,9,,1.0,8/8/2015,Food was bland and overpriced but our waitress was bad af and she was super nice there's no one to blame only the chefs but the service was great.
Justin L.,"Stockton, CA",0,1,,1.0,10/21/2016,"Wow...where do I start. Waited 40 minutes to be seated. This is ok. Family of 5 finally gets seated at a dirty table and a fork with old spinach on it. This was at 800. Ordered food for 5. Food came out at the same time except for one plate. Had to get up and go find out what happen. Orange Chicken tasted like it was made in burnt pan. By 930 we were done. Waited for the check, and waited, and waited. Asked for the manager 3 times and could not find him. The waiter we had was new and nervous. Maybe the manager needs to shadow the new staff members to make sure the service is in point. 945 they say we get free desserts for our trouble. By 1030 the cheesecakes arrived. By that time I was pissed. I am done with this place. People say it only takes one bad experience to ruin things. Congrats Cheesecake Factory. You succeeded in ruining this place for me and my family. Never going back. Poor management. Train your staff well. Oh yeah...you sang happy birthday to the tables around us, but you missed my sons table. Good job."
Jacquie H.,"Tracy, CA",39,10,1,1.0,1/2/2015,"I used to consider this my favorite restaurant ever.   Unfortunately, the Pleasanton site has  now slid into the basement.  Spaghetti meatballs grossly overcooked, turkey undercooked in the Renee's combo, and the clam chowder heavily fishy and over salted.  I felt like it was an Olive Garden  on a late night.  But at Olive Garden, you don't have to wait an hour.  $80 I wish I had spent elsewhere.  Fortunately, the cheesecake remains awesome."
Brian B.,"Livermore, CA",588,1091,120,4.0,6/24/2013,"I still would not wait to eat here but we were in the mall early and were able to walk in when they opened the doors. Service was excellent and I was pleased to see dietary information for everything on their thick menu. Reading the calories and fat info, we were able to pick out a great lunch that was under 600 calories."
Abe N.,"Hayward, CA",0,75,20,5.0,5/16/2015,You cannot go wrong with anything here at cheesecake factory.  Had the Louisiana pasta chicken.  Chicken was cooked crisp and delicious.  Perfect.  Wife had the chicken with mashed potatoes plate.  It was great!
Morgan Joe J.,"Castro Valley, CA",473,18,,5.0,6/20/2015,Good food however sometimes overcooked meat. Excellent French fries. Delicious desserts. Friendly staff.
Amy L.,"Santa Clara, CA",401,747,273,3.0,10/7/2011,"I've come here a couple of times, and it's usually pretty on point, but I don't know.. something about the last time I was here was really off. Service is always super good, and if there's a wait, it's not usually long. However, last time I came here with the boy, we ordered our usual [Da Vinci Pasta], and it was just... such a let down. I don't know whether they ran out of porcini mushrooms or something, but they definitely used just regular button mushrooms, which didn't taste as good as the mushrooms they normally use. The chicken was also really dry and just.. not satisfying. The pasta itself was pretty good, but even that + the sauce [which I normally love to death] couldn't really make up for the letdown that came with the chicken&mushrooms. Sigh. Oh well. At least the pumpkin cheeseckae kind of made up for it hehe. Yum!"
Tiffany T.,"Eugene, OR",119,345,634,4.0,7/23/2011,Good service but even better food! Spicy chicken chipotle pasta! (:
Mary J.,"Castro Valley, CA",408,243,5290,5.0,4/17/2011,"Still a fav spot for BF-Jay & myself, Cheesecake Factory @ Pleasanton's Stoneridge Mall. VISIT: A cool evening on Sunday 4/10/11 around 5-6pm. Dinning area looked crowded (as usual) so we opted for outdoor seating, which was w/in 2-4min after speaking w/ hostess. Bonus we got seated right underneath one of their heat lamps ^_^. SERVICE: Waitress Kim was great! Lived up to the Cheesecake standards of customer service. Thank you dear! Additional assistance from her colleagues was appreciated to. The staff work well together here from host, waiter, bartendar, & kitchen. Keep up the excellent work peeps. FOOD: BF & I LOVE food, but we're definitely trying to watch our portions. We know we can order plates from Cheesecake Factory & share btw the both of us & come out feeling absolutely satisfied. Plus CF's portions are just HUGE! We dined on their ""off the menu Small Plate item"" (per Waitress Kim) for Dynamite Tempura Shrimp, which was scrum-didly-umptous! I saw another table get this huge salad w/ onion rings on top that looked really good, BF found it...so we ordered the BBQ Ranch Chkn Salad. I really would not have been able to finish this alone; perfect split btw the both of us. We'll definitely be back & recommend items we sampled: $6.95 Dynamite Tempura Shrimp (Small Plates Menu) $13.95 BBQ Ranch Chkn Salad FINAL TAB: With 2 Strawberry Lemonades for BF & I, final tab came to $32.82   BF was teasing me 'cuz I realized since we shared our app & salad, hell we might as well have shared a Strawberry Lemonade! Yeah I'm frugal & damn proud!"
Dana K.,"San Ramon, CA",0,3,,1.0,12/23/2014,"I received horrible service here. The waitress was slow and lazy. My friend's meal took over 30 minutes to come after everyone at the table had already finished their plate. The cheesecake after that took 20 minutes to arrive. The male manager did nothing about this after asking to speak to him but say ""thanks for letting me know."" HORRIBLE SERVICE."
David M.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",0,10,,5.0,6/10/2015,Wow what a great experience I had dining at cheesecake factory. My waiter Walter was so attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. I ordered an ice tea and got the black tea which he assured me before hand I would prefer over the tropical. Also was pretty close to getting the factory burger but he quickly told me it was a bust. I ended up getting the jambalaya and banana cheese cake to go which all turned out to be great. When I come back I'm asking to sit back in his section.
