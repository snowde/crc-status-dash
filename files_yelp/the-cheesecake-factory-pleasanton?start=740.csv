Aria H.,"Vallejo, CA",0,9,1,5.0,7/12/2015,"Lovely Cheesecake Factory! Was celebrating my sons 6th Birthday & they definitely made him feel special!! So many of them came to sing to him he thinks the entire restaurant staff was there celebrating with him. He says they gave him a GIGANTIMO cheesecake slice & he loved it! (He's been telling everybody too) Thank You Cheesecake Factory, you were on the same level as Disneyland he says!"
Apit L.,"San Jose, CA",7,343,611,3.0,4/1/2014,I'm not surprised this Cheesecake Factory has an overall rating of 3 stars. This is the most I can give at this location anyway. Service was not exceptional but satisfatory but the food quality was Delish. I tried the Orange chicken with brown rice. Wow!. But they lacked in cleanliness. The silverware had either waterstains or grease stains and I had a nice view of a large garbage bad by their dessert bar. Ugh!. Front desk service also needs improvements and this was only lunch time and on a Tuesday. They're lucky the quality of their food is awesome and the price is reasonable or else I would never come back.
Nina H.,"San Jose, CA",0,5,,2.0,1/6/2016,My girls and to do a girls night out for dinner got a waitress who seemed to be angry. I think she should've just called in a break or something totally messed up the vibe. Other than that the food was delist.
Jose B.,"Alameda County, CA",96,116,23,3.0,2/6/2014,"this was my first time visiting this CF.  I wasn't impressed at all.  It was your traditional layout, and althought the height of the ceilings can be a good thing, this particular place had very tall/or higher than normal ceilings which made it seem cavernous.  Either that or perhaps it was just emptier than usual (or that I am used to seeing any CF when I go). Food was decent, and nothing short of what I am used to expect from them. Would I eat here again?  Perhaps, just to see it another day, at a different hour. Oh, and one last thing was that b/c we sat near the bar, we were placed side by side next to other people, yet the whole restaurant was not that busy?  Felt a little crowded.  Not a good thing."
Ray C.,"San Ramon, CA",9,2,,1.0,12/3/2014,"I would love to tell you how the food was.  We called ahead for reservations at 11 am.  We had a party of 8.  They wouldn't reserve a table for us but told us to come by and we would be seated.  When we arrived at 6, we were told there would be a 2 hour wait.  No thanks.  My family comes here a few times a week for lunch.  Well, we used to.  Great customer service."
Adrienne T.,"Hayward, CA",2,8,3,1.0,11/26/2014,NEVER AGAIN!!!! This is the worst CheeseCake Factory in the bay!! Worst service ever. First of all we order our food and it didn't get served until 56 min later. Then when we got the food it was cold. My fries were stale and cold. The server tried to justify that the fries were fresh. I knew the fries were made hours ago because the were cold. I know my fry!!! The server tried to continue to argue.... I couldn't believe it. I've been to this site a few times and today I will no longer give them the benefit of the doubt. This is truely the worst one ever. If you can drive to SF or to San Jose. Do it. Don't waste your time and money here.
Navneet S.,"Stockton, CA",37,13,8,1.0,8/19/2014,Ordered the appetizer when my wife went to eat it there was a 3 to 4in long HAIR in the appetizer.  So we called the server (Corinne A.) She came by and took it and didnt even asked too see if we wanted something eles instead. And she would check on the tables around us but not ours. When the bill came the appetizer was still on the bill and when I spoke to the manager she told me she got busy and forgot to come out and talk to us about it. I would NEVER go back to this place ever again.  THANK YOU FOR RUINING OUR WEDDING ANNIVERSARY!!!
Marilyn P.,"Gilroy, CA",36,124,2,3.0,1/28/2014,"Came here for the first time 2 weeks ago for happy hour with my GF.  Margaritas are okay  nothing to brag about, but they have a decent happy hour menu.  Prices are low for the portion you get but quality of food is not too great, but then again, it's happy hour price so I can't really complain.  Free chips & salsa, $3 guacamole, $4 cheese quesadilla (extra $2 to add meat). $4 Chimichangas, cheap but my friend and I didn't care for it. The restaurant is nice and clean and I love their patio area out in back.  There are lots of lights which makes the place looks more festive and the lounge seating has a fire pit for a table which can be cozy on a cooler evening.  They also have a 1 man band type of music on certain evenings.  I would return if I'm in the area."
Elizabeth Y.,"Oakland, CA",0,2,,1.0,10/2/2016,"My husband and I went to have to good dinner at this place tonight. The place was super crowded and were told it will take 40 to 50 minutes wait to be sitted,  so instead we decided to order our food to go which also were told will take at least 30 minutes. we did not mind the wait 30 minutes than 40 to 50 minutes.  My husband was looking forward for good chicken Jambalaya  and I looked forward for my Garlic Shrimp tomatoes sauce angel hair pasta. After waiting for over 30 minutes our meal was ready for a pick up picked it up came home to find the worst ever dinner.  My garlic tomatoes sauce shrimp pasta was nothing but whole a lot regular boiled pasta with 4 or 5 shrimp and few chicken.  It was tasteless with no flavor at all the shrimp was rubbery very hard to chew.  The pasta should have been angle hair but that was not the case. I was so disgusted I ended up dumping the whole thing in the garbage, hopping my husband's Jambalaya to be better.  we were  so wrong it was just  boiled pasta flavored with butter added a few chicken and some peas and chopped bacon.  There was no be called jambalaya as we both have never ever seen such a dish, It was too blend with no flavor at all he ended up throwing it away as well.  This is the worst experience for both of us I never wrote feed back on any restaurant but tonight it was so bad we had to write this.  It will be the last for both of us to never ever to go back the wait and quality is not worth a penny."
Sally M.,"San Bruno, CA",75,10,3,5.0,5/17/2015,"First off, the general manager for this restaurant is so professional and awesome! I  hugely recommend this place as long as she's the general manager! Sam is so upbeat and provides grey customer service."
Ken L.,"San Leandro, CA",180,134,449,4.0,7/16/2014,"I love this Cheesecake Factory! We've been to this particular one over a dozen times especially after shopping at Macy's or in the Mall.   The staff is great, the food is great you may have to deal with a little bit of  a wait if you go during peak times but once you get seated, they are on the ball.   My favorite appetizers is the Firecracker Salmon, crab cakes or buffalo wings, and they have this deep fried, beer batter avocado, mushroom concoction that is off the hook.  As for my main dish, you can't go wrong with the Grilled Chicken and Avacado Club or the Miso Salmon, Cuban sandwich or anything on the menu, I love it all."
Rosie F.,"San Leandro, CA",3,54,37,3.0,2/18/2015,You now have to ASK for bread.  Your server will not just bring it out to you or ask you if you'd like some.  I guess this will save the company some money but it makes the servers look like they're discriminating when they bring bread out to a table by you.  But never mention that you have to ask for it.
Stacy B.,"Livermore, CA",1,21,11,1.0,6/19/2015,"Food was average but I'm not here to complain about the food. I went to use the ladies room and there wasn't any accessible toilet paper in my stall. I yelled to see if maybe someone else could hand me some TP but, I was alone. So I literally had to walk out of my stall into the stall next to me which was very embarrassing. Luckily the other stall had some TP. The bathroom was in pretty bad/gross shape for the Cheesecake Factory. (Food was in the sink, un-flushed toilets, very little soap and just looked unclean.) I spent a lot of money $$$ on my food and expected to at least use a non-gross functioning bathroom. I complained to a young girl in the hostess stand in the front and she didn't seem to care. Nor did I see her walk away to do anything after I told her. I was really upset and embarrassed that this happened to me. Especially since the business establishment doesn't care."
Art G.,"Danville, CA",0,24,,5.0,5/11/2014,"We had a party of 10 last night for a birthday and all had a great meal and a great time. Drinks, chicken pasta dishes, kid's meals and of course the required 30th Anniversary cheesecake were fab.  It must be noted that the management and wait staff are excellent-which is a rare experience. Kudos to them for making it a special night."
Connie M.,"Littleton, CO",1,4,,1.0,3/29/2016,Went there with a party of 8. The food is mediocre and the service is worse. It all started when they forgot an appetizer and it went down hill from there.  Half of the orders were prepared wrong with another plate being brought out after the rest of the table had finished eating.I could go on an on but needless to say it was just a bad experience.
AndreaJoy J.,"Wichita, KS",3,6,,1.0,4/4/2015,I was charged $10 extra on the tip. Even after I put the amount for tip and the total amount on the receipt. Ugh!!! Great and of course I threw my receipt already. Who would've thought they would screw me on tip!
T C.,"Oakland, CA",112,791,313,4.0,1/21/2013,"Go ahead, roll your eyes at me and call me a suburban-lovin yuppie eater. I fuckin love me some Cheesecake Factory.  They should really change their name to the Chicken Factory because they have as many chicken dishes on their menu as they do cheesecakes..if not more. I love those avocado egg rolls.. always have, always will. I tried something on the under 500 calories menu [shrimp tacos] and I loved them...I still do not think they were 500 calories or less..but they were great! The only weird thing that happened, was 2 separate managers coming out and giving us some smoke-up-the-ass excuses about my friend's complicated chicken tacos, that turned out not to be so complicated at all. But, we let it slide. (which is weird because we're not the type to usually let that shit slide, but we had shopping to do) I didn't get a dessert.  I know.. I did it wrong..I'll go back and get some another time."
Jurek Z.,"Fremont, CA",1,27,1,4.0,3/27/2014,"We visited around 11:30 on Thursday and were seated immediately. The interior is very well done and clean. The service was excellent, friendly and kind. The food was above our expectations in taste and appearance. Portions are very large - suitable for sharing, especially if one is planning on having one of their deserts. Unfortunately some of the silverware was not clean and had to be exchanged. The place was kind of loud at lunch - measured about at 75 deciBells."
Crosley G.,"Brentwood, CA",244,132,34,5.0,9/28/2014,"Just had dinner here and the service and food was impeccable. It was around 9:30pm Sat night...had to wait 30 min to get a table but once we sat down, we were served right away. Despite them being very busy, everything we ordered came very quickly. Must try the crab bites and the macaroni and cheese balls! Great dining experience."
Roxana J.,"Fremont, CA",1,14,2,1.0,7/26/2014,"Before you devalue this review (because of the 1 star), I would like to say that when you have restaurant experience, you tend to create certain customer service expectations. This review was long over-due but I would like to express how horrified I STILL am with the service here. I came here with a large party for a friend's birthday and will NEVER go back. There were about 18 of us and yes, we were all under 21, but you can't judge a book by its cover. So, to the servers that I heard complain, you are UNPROFESSIONAL and it is a bad reflection of your personal character and of the restaurant.  Before we were even sat, the hostess gave us a cold welcome and was disrespectful when I handed her a dirty fork to take from the table I was seating on.  So here we are, just being seated from a 2 hour wait and the servers are preoccupied with their pessimistic attitudes and the hostess was upset because she had to pick up a dirty fork from the table. She was so upset that she left it there anyway. I wish I can give my 2 servers a 5 star review because they were fantastic, but I can't because of everything else. I'm sorry guys.  I will never dine here again, first and last time ever."
