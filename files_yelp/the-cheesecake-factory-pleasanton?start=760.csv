Jason S.,"San Ramon, CA",0,1,,5.0,6/6/2015,"New to California, thought we would try this restaurant after doing our shopping. There were layers upon layers of choices on their dinner menu my date and I were lost. Our waiter, Daniel, even though mentioned he was still pretty new helped us both find exactly what we wanted. The food was delicious and I noticed that he went out of his way to get us our food quickly because he knew we were in a rush to get to a movie. We will definitely return."
Jeffrey D.,"Livermore, CA",0,23,,4.0,4/25/2015,"Service is great ! Food=Pricey. Spaghetti and meatballs kinda bland but I didn't care, there was plenty, wife ate half and I ate the same and it did fill us up. Celebrated my daughter's 31st birthday as well as my wife and I's 30 wedding anniversary the same night and the waiter/waitresses sang happy birthday to us and for that, I am grateful. Cheesecake was o.k................Our server was very polite and professional and grated the cheese over our meal by hand just like they do in Italy. Full menu and dessert list. I think our waiter's name was  Antonio ? You were great !!"
Felicia T.,"Elk Grove, CA",27,16,6,2.0,2/21/2015,"Went here with my bf and the wait was not bad for a Sat. evening. Once seated, the service was sooooo slow...we waited 10 minutes to place our drink order and we had to place it with another waitress. I think we saw our waiter once before we saw him again after about 15 minutes and he let us know he was leaving and someone else was going to be our waitress. We place our order and had an appetizer before dinner. We ordered calimeri and it was soooo greasy!!! OMG!!! My entrée was the salmon with mashed potatoes. The fish was good, but the potatoes were sooo runny! My bf get chicken Marsala with bow tie pasta. The chicken was good, but the pasta was soo under cooked. I don't know what's up with this location, but they need to get it together."
Danya A.,"Pleasanton, CA",15,19,2,5.0,3/20/2015,I love this venue.  My family celebrates all our birthdays here.  The happy hour specials are a steal!
Stephanie C.,"Redding, CA",2,29,7,3.0,2/16/2015,"I'm only giving this location 3 stars because I love the food. But I've had my worst experience here last Friday around lunch time. Our waitress was slow, constantly talking to the other employees and drinking some water in the corner when I'm sitting here waiting my whole meal for my Oreo milkshake. And then when i got it I was ready to leave and was full already. I asked another waitress, since mine was in the corner chit chatting, for a to go cup for my shake. I paid 7 bucks for it! I should have asked for it free. The other waitress seemed to completely forget about me. Then I went up to mine in her ""corner"" and asked her. Finally was about to leave. I didn't leave a great tip, she did not deserve it."
Billy G.,"Petaluma, CA",201,100,19,2.0,1/20/2015,"This is the place to be if you want to wait 30 minutes for a seat with 70 other people and then be seated next several families approximately 18 inches from your table with children that are trying to be contestants for the next spoon banging bart protest.  Aside of that chaos the food is very good.  Although, I don't care if they served the best food in the world I will never go back there and endure the painfulness of all the noisy people staring right at you because there's no choice, as they are damn near seated at your table."
LC B.,"Stockton, CA",29,211,11,4.0,11/22/2013,"Had birthday lunch for a friend here on a Saturday. Was very busy but quickly seated within 10 minutes.  I had the everything pizza and it was big enough for 2-3 persons. Everyone else seemed to enjoy their salads and pasta. For dessert we all shared a slice of tiramisu and white chocolate cheesecake. Tiramisu cheesecake was light, creamy, with a hint of coffee...(soo darn good). The white chocolate was too sweet for my tooth but seemed to be favored most at our table... Can't wait to come back for more cheesecake :)"
Steph C.,"San Lorenzo, CA",300,395,68,5.0,11/20/2013,"Lunch was awesome here! Here's the scoop: - Be prepared to wait. Lunch on a Saturday equals full-to-the-brim restaurant. There's indoor and patio seating. If you're picky where to park your bum, let the host/ess know.  - Great service, even when they're swamped. This is what I appreciate the most. I think they have a ton of servers just to keep the quality up. Or, if they don't have a ton of servers, their service is just spot on.  - Great atmosphere. The employees are friendly, helpful to each other and the tables are near but far enough to enjoy a conversation with your dining counterparts. - The raspberry and strawberry lemonade is sweet and tangy, plus you get free refills I usually migrate away from chains, but this location has got me hooked."
Tiana S.,"Pleasanton, CA",5,113,71,4.0,11/14/2013,"Foods good, it get really crowded.  Normally I would give the food 3.5 stars because it doesn't WOW, but you get a lot of it and it's not bad. Also I LOVE their carrot cake cheese cake.  It's amazing!"
Anita A.,"Castro Valley, CA",0,4,,1.0,2/22/2016,"I honestly love the food at the Cheesecake Factory but this location by far has the WORST SERVICE EVER !! Unfortunately we don't have any other cheesecake factories closer to our house than this one , and every time without fail , we just get treated poorly. They never ask for refills or if everything is okay , NOTHING . It's horrible"
L D.,"Dublin, CA",53,95,1,4.0,12/30/2013,"Love this place! Food is always good but service could use some work! Most if l not all cheesecakes are on point, but not freshly made in store- but nowadays what's is!!!!! Love the lettuce Thai wraps, Avacado rolls, fish tacos, Santa Fe Chicken salad.... You can never go wrong to be honest.  If only they could work on making sure customers are pleased and happy before leaving... I've had 3 bad incidents with late food (35+minutes) or wrong order brought out and never once did a manager do anything BUT apologize. A nice discount, free cheesecake, glass of wine, coupon for next visit.... SOMETHING! Again I go back because food and portion is GOOD!"
Luis L.,"Oakland, CA",1,25,42,3.0,7/31/2014,"This is the first time I eat at this location and I'm disappointed. First off, the male host was not very  nice. He seemed bothered by everyone and like he really didn't want to be there. The service was only okay. When they brought my daughter's drink it had something floating around in it and had to send it back. One of the things I really like about the cheesecake factory is there passion iced tea but when I ordered my drink and it came out it looked very cloudy and the taste was not good at all. I asked what was going on with there tea and I was told that they had just changed tea brands.  The look and taste was not good. I showed the waiter and another waitress and they agreed. I'm very disappointed that they did that. I hope that the rest of the cheesecake factories don't change brands because that would be a total deal breaker for me a would probably stop eating here.  I hope they read this and reconsider going back to the paradise brand as it makes a huge difference. As for the other issues, well that's a hole other thing that this location needs to take care off."
Ivy R.,"Martinez, CA",137,1779,4674,4.0,12/12/2008,Compared to some of the reviews given I really liked this place. I had never been here before and I was with a group of 20-25 people. They had plenty of room to fit everyone and the waitstaff was really good especially with a group of this size.  The food was as expected to exceptional but good. I was very satisfied. I got the Chicken Belagio. Calamari was well calamari. But getting to the dessert. I had the Carrot Cake Cheese Cake. Holy Crap! It was unbelievable. Overall the food was really good.  The restaurant reminded me of some type of restaurant that you would go to in Las Vegas. Very big and gaudy looking. They were also very busy. So I can see how that would be annoying. We didn't like were the restaurant initially put us so when we asked to be moved to a different location they worked with our group and were very accommodating.  I like this place and will probably go back again. May be next time I will try out the bar.
Beatrice C.,"North Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA",476,343,37,3.0,8/24/2011,"The Cheesecake Factory offers a pretty standard menu, so the only variations you can expect are service and food quality. I went here today after picking my mom up from work at the nearby Safeway corporate headquarters. There wasn't any wait, which was a pleasant surprise. Our original server was nice and very attentive. However, she went on her break after taking our orders and giving us bread. The server who took over for her was a younger gentleman who took awhile to get the things we needed. My sister ordered the baked potato soup, but it came AFTER her order of macaroni and cheese. Uh... doesn't soup generally come before an entree? The food here is generally OK, but today was one of those ""miss"" kind of days. My mom's orange chicken literally had no sauce on it, so she had to ask for a side of the orange sauce. She later commented that it seemed like they just microwaved it. My experience with the food was even worse. I ordered the crusted chicken romano, which comes with pasta in a light tomato sauce. To my horror I found that my pasta was not even fully cooked--some of the spaghetti noodles were still as firm as they would have been out of the package. How disappointing. I didn't say anything though, because I'm almost certain I would have had to wait forever for a new plate of spaghetti. The chicken was good though. This experience was the one time I've been let down by The Cheesecake Factory, so I think it's fair that I'm giving them an average review. I like them for the most time, but this time I was not pleased, especially since it's a little pricy here. I'd like good service and fully-cooked food if I'm paying a lot."
Edna G.,"East Bay, CA",574,749,8705,3.0,4/8/2011,"Place is always packed but we went during a weekday lunch so it was a 20 min wait. The best to me were the appetizers. We has crab and artichoke dip and fire cracker salmon. My husband and I chose two pastas. The shrimp garlic noodles was my choice but was ok. It needed more sauce and the asparagus should have been softer. The Louisiana crispy chicken noodles was better which was my husbands choice. The service was good and place was well staffed. I would still come back but choose something else as the menu has a very large selection. Of course, you have to go here for the dessert and my favorite is the original cheesecake with strawberries on top with hot fudge on the side. Can't come here without not having dessert."
Jessica W.,"San Lorenzo, CA",11,74,59,3.0,11/28/2011,"I've only been to Cheesecake Factory one time, and I found it to be a pretty A-OK experience. There was a large variety of different types of foods, and the staff was really nice. One thing that was totally not cool was the wait time. My group made reservations, but still had to wait over half an hour after our reservation time in order to get seated. Some of the things that I really like about Cheesecake Factory: 1. They make skinny mojitos 2. Delicious appetizers 3. Variety of different food and desserts The portions are really large, so large that I would say that they are a little too big. After having some appetizers I only ended up eating a little less than 1/3 of my meal. The size of the portions compared to the price that you pay is relatively worth it. You take the rest home, and you have two meals to eat later. Despite having extremely large portions, the taste of the food is nothing too overly fantastic. The part of my meal that I really enjoy and would recommend to other is the strawberry shortcake dessert for $5-$6 dollars. It was HUGEEEEE just like all their other food. Totally a bang for your buck, and a nice option if you're looking for something that's not as rich as cheesecake. One of the things that I didn't like was the dark lighting. It makes it hard to see your food, and the people sitting across from you at the table. It's a place that I wouldn't mind coming to and some time in the future I want to try out their happy hour menu."
Glenn W.,"Carmel, CA",1,22,,4.0,2/5/2015,"We just ate at this location on a Monday night. I agree with most of the reviews here. It was noisy, very crowded - It was hopping for a Monday night! The wait was about 45 mins. I received my food while my wife did not. After bringing this to our waiters attention, he immediately brought her a bowl of soup while she was waiting. Her food was brought out eventually.  All the food was very good. Our waiter was excellent. When the Manager came out with the food she apologized for the wait. She also took appropriate action on the check. Ordinarily these types of issues would never garner 4 starts from me. However, the Wait staff and Manager went above and beyond the usual, and food was very good. And then there's the cheesecake....."
Amanda W.,"Oakland, CA",98,16,379,2.0,8/21/2014,"I wanted to enjoy the weather, eat and have a drink outside but the service with Stephanie was horrible! I'm pretty understanding when it's busy and rarely complain but jeez was she bad. It wasn't busy at all and I sat there for 20-30mins without utensils and when I said told her she made another staff member get it for us while she stood inside talking. I still like their cheesecakes though! :)"
Josh B.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",39,655,,3.0,12/13/2014,"It's cheesecake factory. You know what you are getting before you walk in the door. Good food, good selection, crazy busy."
Christina M.,"San Francisco, CA",10,22,7,3.0,1/26/2014,"Cheesecake Factory is one of those restaurants that's fun to go to since each one has a different decor and ambiance. Even though I usually order the same items, their menu has so much variety that it's fun to look through and choose from! :) Also it's spacious with high ceilings, so there's lots of space!"
