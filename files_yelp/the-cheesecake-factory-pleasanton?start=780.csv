Inconspicuous V.,"East Bay, CA",0,106,16,2.0,11/5/2014,"I'm giving two stars on the drinks.  The food and wait staff are incredible, never had any bad service or food.  BUT, the 4-5 oz. of drink disguised within a boatload of ice for the cost of $11.95 for a tiny blueberry mojito makes me hesitate on getting anything more than water."
Tami M.,"Stockton, CA",10,64,63,5.0,9/26/2014,Husband first time and he loved it! Chicken Madiera was delicious and hubby chicken stuffed tortilla delicious too! We will be back just wish you had one in Stockton area! Closest is Sacramento or Pleasanton
Samantha G.,"Riverbank, CA",0,4,,1.0,4/5/2015,"Ordered what I get at every time I go to any Cheesecake Factory (tomato,basil,mozzarella flat bread), which is usually a flat bread with marinara sauce drizzled with mozzarella cheese and basil. What I was served was an undercooked roll of dough with unevenly spread mozzarella, giant Alize's of tomato, and 2 basil leaves. Definitely not worth the amount I paid for.  The service was HORRRRRIIIBLE. I was seated at about 6pm and didn't end up leaving until 8:15. Our server only came by our table maybe twice and we had to clear our table for her, go get our own dessert menus, go get our own utensils, we were practically serving ourselves.  When she finally came to our table to give us our check, she was very rude, bossy and unpleasant. Granted, it was on the busy side, but everyone who came after us had received their food & left before we even placed our full order.  Horrible experience. Over priced & mediocre food. WONT be going to the Pleasanton Cheesecake Factory again."
Tony L.,"Castro Valley, CA",81,14,4,2.0,1/18/2014,"Came here to get my little sister her first alcoholic drink, as she is now legal. First of all the service was really bad, our waiter took a really long time to take our orders and not only that he barely came back to see how our table was doing. my brother order a blended drink but it still had chunks of ice in it so we asked for it to be re blended. And they did just that, they just threw the left over drink into the blender and blended it again instead of making him a new one, mind you this was a non-alcoholic drink! usually they'll make you a new one right?? the food wasn't that good either, especially the nachos DONT GET THE NACHOS. Although the drinks overall was decent. my overall experience was ruined by the service and the food. the only thing worth getting was the tuna carpaccio."
Amanda K.,"San Ramon, CA",7,24,8,5.0,3/29/2015,"MMMM, I always get the chicken marsala and the mojitos are eally good also."
Grace C.,"Raleigh, NC",177,260,478,4.0,5/7/2013,"I think all the Cheesecake Factories I have been to are pretty standard; nothing special or bad about each location and experience I've ever had and this location wasn't any different. As long as CF has great cheesecakes, I will always return :) This weekend we went to Cheesecake Factory for my boyfriend's mother's day brunch. We arrive around 1:30ish and the wait was about 45 minutes. Pretty standard at all CFs. One good thing that our server allowed was to order off the Brunch menu. We were seated around 2:15 and brunch ends at 2. He got that order in first and then came back to get everyone's drink and lunch orders. Overall it was a good experience, but like I said before its no different than at other CF locations. Our server was nice and friendly, and food came out promptly. We had the standard; What do you want to drink?, Would you like some bread and butter while you wait?, Here are you dishes, Is there anything else I can get for you?, How is everything?, Dessert?. Here is the check."
Jessica A.,"Killeen, TX",0,7,,5.0,1/9/2016,Such a long wait but definitely worth it. The food was delicious and although it was super busy the service was not hindered.
Paxton O.,"Pleasanton, CA",0,2,2,1.0,3/22/2015,"My food always comes to my table cold. The place is so damn pact that your food sits for a while before being delivered. Waitresses are awesome, most of them. Cheesecake is the reason I'll ever go back."
Ron R.,"Livermore, CA",1197,693,7954,4.0,9/2/2010,"This location isn't one of my favorite CF locations, but it's serviceable.    My first date suggestion would be to go to the newer Walnut Creek location versus this one, lol.   Although this one isn't bad, it's clean and service was excellent.  I guess going here on a weekday is the key to good service.  Johnny was very helpful, as well as the other servers.   There's plenty to choose from on the menu, so it's really hard for anyone to judge the food.  In reading all the reviews, I think it's best to suggest.  Like the Famous Factory Meatloaf, delicious!   As far as appetizers: The calamari was made just right, and not too oily.  Also had the stuffed mushrooms, seemed like it was microwaved. The ahi tartare is always an excellent choice.   I ordered the Cuban Sandwich with the slow roasted pork, ham, swiss, pickles and mustard in a buttery pressed roll.  Can I say, caloric heaven goodness!!!   Cheesecake suggestions:  The Tiramisu, Kahlua Cocoa Coffee, Dulce De Leche Caramel  There's a lot to choose from and a lot calories on the menu, so just make sure you bring at least $35 for yourself to gain a FULL experience."
Treadmill E.,"Pleasanton, CA",9,12,7,4.0,12/8/2014,"Had dinner here last night with my gf and a friend. I ordered the strawberry smoothie which is always delicious and my gf had a mango iced tea. I ordered the steak Diane which was amazingly delicious and it came with mashed potatoes and a mushroom wine sauce!!!!! Off the hook!! I ordered my steak well done and it's a bit pricey, but it's so worth it!!! Would totally recommend the steak diane to all steak lovers!!! My gf ordered a pizza which had all the ingredients and my friend had chicken and broccoli.  He wasn't impressed with the flavor and thought the food was bland. Oh well..... service was fast and everything was delicious!!! Btw for dessert I had the black out cake which is my favorite chocolate cake of all time!"
MM A.,"San Jose, CA",61,26,25,3.0,7/20/2012,"Food is so delicious, though you will always have a hard time to be sit and they brought mine entry and starter together! So what was the point of having a starter!  Inside is always noisy so I could barely hear what my friends were saying."
Maricruz M.,"Berkeley, CA",22,3,,5.0,3/15/2015,This is one of my favorites places to go and have a good drink  but their chicken chipotle pasta mmmmmm...... It's delicious you should try it next time you go to this restaurante it's deffinately worth it .
Aarie C.,"Oakland, CA",10,37,5,3.0,9/12/2013,"Kind of annoying that although my gf and I come here almost once a month they still ask us ""Is this your first time here?"" As we are being seated.  Also annoying that the servers are never helpful with suggestions when I'm stuck in indecision trying to find something new to try!  Never come for lunch. The wait is treacherous. We always come at 10 or later when it's quiet (but dark as hell.... Can't even get an Instagram shot)."
Lorena L.,"Tustin, CA",2,10,3,2.0,12/2/2014,Yikes.... Service was not the best... I am in the service industry and these guys have no idea what hospitality means....
Becka C.,"East Bay, CA",62,76,459,3.0,1/11/2011,"Great place for lunch if you have time. The wait at this location on a Monday afternoon was only 12 min.  The place is always busy because it's in the Stoneridge Mall strip and there's not much eateries to choose from. My best advice is to order Lunch portions for whatever you're looking at on the menu from salads, to pastas, to burgers.  They are still huge compared to the dinner options, but at a fraction of the price."
Azn B.,"Oakland, CA",620,156,139,4.0,7/13/2012,"I've never been a big fan of Cheesecake Factory; their food is unimaginative, everything is overpriced, and for a place with ""Cheesecake"" in their name, their cheesecake is certainly not anything I would worship. Other than going to the SF one for views, other ones are usually a forced trip for birthdays and such. With that said, this Cheesecake Factory was actually tolerable, even... good?      This is not my first time at this particular TCF (I got lazy), but this was the first time I actually enjoyed it. After numerous trips to many of their chains, I have finally found a dish that I liked: - I ordered the Chicken Bellagio ($15). Pesto, basil pasta with roasted, crusted chicken topped with arugula and thinly sliced prosciutto. It also had hints of white sauce that I'm assuming is alfredo and, above all, topped with freshly grated parmesan. I gave my whole table some and they alll loved it! The portion was huge, enough to take half of it home (if I didn't give 1/4 of it away). Too bad it's almost 2000 calories by itself. Whyyyy...  - Red Velvet Cheesecake ($8). I've never liked their cheesecake, and this one wasn't any better. The cheesecake wasn't cheesy enough, a little too sweet for my taste. It's more reminiscent of frosting than cheesecake which completely bugs me. I also like it colder and this is semi-room temp. Not to mention how over priced it is just for a slice... - I also tried their Crab Bites and they're actually quite delicious. Mini balled up crab meat and perhaps jicama, lightly battered and fried. Very soft, tender, and flaky. Too bad I only had one :[ - Mini Crab Wontons ($10). I preferred the Crab bites, but these were not bad. They came with a lot, perfect for a big party.       The main reason why I'm giving this TCF 4 stars is because of their tremendous service. I usually don't care for service but they were exceptionally nice. They came back to check with our table in the perfect amount of times. They boxed our food. They respond with such politeness and grace to our needs. They even apologized when I ask them to send the cheesecake back because it came out right when I got my entree (I specifically asked for it at the end). They were really nice about everything."
Maria T.,"Orange County, CA",56,269,130,3.0,1/26/2015,"This place is crazy busy. On a Sunday evening, we were shoulder-to-shoulder, crammed in the lobby. One of the customers said she's a regular and it's typically packed.  Other than that, it's your typical Cheesecake Factory (big portions, mid-price range). Food was consistent with all the other Cheesecake Factories I've been to throughout CA. I like that Cheesecake Factory added a list of healthier options."
Mrs. K.,"Pleasanton, CA",24,26,18,2.0,12/20/2015,"Dined at Cheesecake Factory late this morning.  Food is always yummy, but we did have several cleanliness issues today.  When we were seated at our booth the table was already set.  Two of the bread plates had caked on debris.  Had those switched out right away and didn't think twice about it... Until we went to eat and two of us had forks with caked on debris.  At this point I was getting quite disgusted thinking about if those forks had made it into our mouths.  At this point I asked the hostess who was walking by to send over a manager.  A young lady came over and approached Grandma, lol and asked what was the problem.  I let her know I asked for her and shared with her about the cleanliness issues.  She apologized and commented they probably needed to change the water in the dishwasher.  That was all.  Wasn't very satisfied with the response.  Would've been nice to have been offered a free dessert or coupon for a future visit.  Oh and the seem where the booths meet was full of crumbs too."
Jo J.,"San Leandro, CA",0,4,,1.0,8/6/2016,"If you wand to have horrible serice, Justin is your man but be be wary, he will ignore you. We waited 40 minutes for a table (which we expected so it was no big deal) and we're promptly ignored by our waiter, Justin...I know his name since I asked another staff person. Well, we waited for 17 minutes while Justin as well as all other servers ignored us. He passed by us 8 times and stared at us a few times. I guess he was confused if he was to help us or not based on the fact the that our menu's were still on our tables and there were no drinks  there either....clearly one of us was does not know his purpose. A different waiter took our order (arranged by the manager because i complained about my servers neglect) and i felt a migraine comming on. After waiting for another 10 minutes, Justin approaches my table for thdecided to leave. I informed the manager who was kind, that we were leaving and the reason why.....pathetic service and a killer migraine. ....JUST LOST A CUSTOMER FOR LIFE!!!e first time and as you about 10 words, bringing us the wrong drink order, and walks away. 12 minutes later, my migraine it at an all-time high so I CHEERS!"
Sarah F.,"Walnut Creek, CA",4,49,1,1.0,1/10/2013,"My FAVORITE meal ever, is the Cheesecake Factory's Ahi Carpaccio.  I order it whenever I'm eating there and whenever I do take out.  Last night, they refused to serve it to go.  What?!?!? It's on the Curbside to go Menu!!!!  Why is it on a to go menu, if I can't order it to go?  And I've ordered it to go several times in the last couple of months.  So mad. I had been planning on picking it up all day long. So, after a cycling class and a few hours of not eating, I was ravenous.  And this jerk is telling me I need to come in and order it from a server or bartender, eat one bite, and then I can take it to go. Forget this place!  Go to California Pizza Kitchen instead."
