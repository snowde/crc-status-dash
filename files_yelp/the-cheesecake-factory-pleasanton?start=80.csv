Rex G.,"Pleasanton, CA",0,26,21,2.0,11/12/2017,Took my family to this restaurant for the first time to celebrate a birthday in our family. Food was okay. What was disappointing was that they made a mistake on my other when everyone got their food. The manager only offered a small salad so i have something to eat. It took a long time before i got my food and the rest of my family are basically done eating. Hopefully if you try this place you will have a better experience than we did.
Roberto Z.,"Arcata, CA",13,17,7,5.0,11/11/2017,Back here after a few years in company of someone special and I have to say that the food taste and service is great . The sangria is a must .........
Sal W.,"Lathrop, CA",1,58,10,2.0,11/10/2017,"Why does it take for ever to order a togo piece of cheesecake?!  Wait, pay, wait, wait, 15min later get a simple slice of cheesecake."
Felicita R.,"Pleasanton, CA",211,9,3,1.0,11/13/2017,Service  was awful and took over 35 minutes for dinner and we had a group of 10 and they did not check in on us. I was so unhappy and had to ask where the food was too.
Gerald H.,"San Francisco, CA",634,827,12777,3.0,11/25/2016,"Decent food but slow service. They ran out of avocados for the egg roll at 6:30 on a Friday?? It's seems this place is always under staffed. Even when it wasn't fully crowded it took 45 minutes to get our food.  The salads are too big and can feed two people easily (note to self) if you're one of those people that count calories be warned one meal here can easily consume most of your daily intake, even the salads. People come here because it's nicely decorated and the energy lends itself to a ""hot spot"" I used to laugh at friends who waited two hours for a table. It's just a fancy diner."
Mia G.,"San Diego, CA",1,18,14,5.0,11/5/2017,I come here at least once a week for their awesome food and staff are ok. Service is ok but overall I am here for the food.
Jenny T.,"Bismarck, ND",7,32,,2.0,11/4/2017,"We decided to try TCF for the first time tonight, had heard from family about their great pastas. We were told there was a 30 min wait and given a buzz box. We nearly missed our call for seating as the box never went off and the young woman calling out names was barely loud enough to be heard. I had ordered the Chicken Alfredo, my husband the fish. The wait for bread and our entrees were very long, close to an hour. I was told all orders are made fresh, since I had ordered pasta I conceded to wait. Our dinners finally arrive and were disappointed. The pasta was unfortunately, sticky and gummy with undercooked chicken. The sauce was like glue. My husband said the fish was decent, but had far too much breading and he did not like the tartar sauce at all. The portions are more than enough for the price.      I informed the manager of the less than palatable pasta dish, he gave a vague attempt at an apology and tried to explain how the kitchen might have overcooked or messed up the cream sauce. He offered to remove it from the bill, which I excepted as I had eaten very little of it. My husband took the left over fish home for our dogs.      Our server was wonderful, very attentive and professional, hence the two starts.     The place was very busy during our visit, music was so loud you couldn't hear each other to really carry on a decent conversation. We were seated at a table with barely enough elbow room between tables; not really a private or intimate atmosphere for an enjoyable dinner.           We did not stay for dessert as the place was too loud and crowded. I can't say we would visit The Cheesecake Factory again in the future."
Brian M.,"Fremont, CA",25,42,1,1.0,6/10/2017,"The worst experience EVER at the Cheesecake Factory. We were there 5/20/17 from 3pm -5pm. Simply put the waitperson Nicole, was the worst wait person our order and just left us there for damn near an hour. We looked around and she was busy handling a bigger  friggin group. Next thing we know she passes by and tells us ""I'm so sorry that your food is not here...my manager will be by to speak with you.""    Ten or fifteen minutes pass and the manager arrives and apologizes and states ""we're going to pay for your main dishes that you ordered...they should be arriving in less than 10 minutes.""     So, should I call ""BS"" now or just state that the given promise of the manager was an all out lie. Well, both then! Almost 25 minutes elapsed and our so-called ""lunch"" was served to us closer to 4:30pm. We didn't even finish the food due to the fact that it was tepid, not hot but tepid, like luke warm water. The weather outside was hotter than the food bought to our table.       Suffice to say, this was the worst Cheesecake Factory experience we've ever had.       It will be a while until we come back to eat at CF."
Rod M.,"San Francisco, CA",174,864,564,3.0,10/20/2017,Standard Cheesecake Factory but I really appreciate their takeout service which is always solid.
Rachel W.,"Modesto, CA",16,85,13,2.0,7/30/2017,I feel like the quality of the food has gone down. The chicken lettuce wraps were all vegetables and 1 tiny piece of chicken on top that was so dry and the fish tacos were all burnt and the sides were cold. I think it was microwaved. Who wants to go to a restaurant for microwaved food and Cheesecake Factory is not cheap. The service was pretty good but the food was mediocre at best. I don't know when I'll be returning after this experience.
Anthony And Joan F.,"Dublin, CA",2,18,1,1.0,7/5/2017,"WTF!!!! Come to an early dinner during mid week and this is what I get presented with...a laundry list of ""sorry we don't have that!"" This is unbelievable!!! The last time I saw something like this was when a restaurant was about to close down and they no longer ordered food to restock the freezer. The main chef should have fired the person or persons responsible for ordering necessary ingredients for even the most basic dishes!!! #FAIL (see photo)"
Chrissy C.,"San Francisco, CA",103,28,23,1.0,6/21/2017,"Hoooooorrrrrrrrrriiiiibbbllllllleeeeeeeeeee. The hostess told us a 20 min wait for a party of 2. Several couples AFTER us got seated and so we checked with the hostess on the progress. The answer we got was ""oh, your number fell off the list"". Really???  So she said we would be next. Then we sit back down in the waiting area and the hostess continues to seat other couples! Wth?!?!  So my husband goes back up and ""oh, we can't find your number/pager"".  An hour for this.  This is probably the worst Cheesecake Factory I've ever been to. Ever."
Roma H.,"Fremont, CA",4,18,5,4.0,2/20/2017,After a loooong wait of 50 minutes for a 3 pm check-in we got a table by 3:50. After that the service was excellent. Their Steak Diane was a great Gluten Free choice.  The Godiva choc cheesecake was awesome - to die for level of greatness.  An enjoyable Linner and great service.
Dennis C.,"Reno, NV",4,15,2,1.0,10/28/2017,"Waiting for outdoor seats for 3 over 45 mins. Looking at more than 10 unseated tables I was like wtf. I spoke to the waiter, and she did a typical response and just ignored me until I get mad. If it wasn't for someone birthday, I wouldn't come and plus the silverware was very dirty. I don't know if they even clean it with detergent here."
Arezoo S.,"Danville, CA",59,13,9,1.0,6/18/2017,I wish there was a 0 star option... Was our worst experience ever. Took them 20 min to get our order and another 55 min to get our food.  Our food came so cold as if it was sitting in the kitchen for min 30 min. And we never got the Parmesan that we've been promised ! 25 min later we could get  our waiter's attention to let him know about the food. All three tables around us were also very disappointed with the food and service.  At the end they didn't charge us for my food.  Our server was a nice man and we can't blame it on him as he had to handle so many tables at once.  I think cheese cake factory has to really work on their management system.  Will never come back.
Lisa S.,"Hayward, CA",0,5,,1.0,4/28/2017,"Because of the incompetent people that work here, we were not able to enjoy a nice dinner with our sister who is in the military before she returned to Korea. This was the worst restaurant experience we have ever had. The night ended with us being chased down in the parking lot by 2 managers accusing us of walking out on the bill.   We got there at 6:45 pm and was told that it would be about a 30 minute wait, they gave us a pager and we sat down. They paged us, went to seat us then told us that it was a mistake, escorted us back to the waiting area and had us waiting longer. We were finally seated and the poor customer service continued. Our orders were taken and the manager offered us a free appetizer which we appreciated but by 9:00 pm we still had not received our food. People who came in after us were already eating so we told the waiter to cancel our orders and left since we lost our appetites and had enough of the BS. The only items we received at this point were 4 waters and a coke, the waiter did not stop us and tell us we had a bill. When we got to our car we were bombarded by both managers, one proceeded to take a picture of our license plate and told us that the police and mall security were on their way. She accused us of walking out on our bill and running away from them when we saw them coming. Mind you, I had my five month old baby in my arms sleeping and we were not walking together as a group since my husband walked ahead to get the car seat in first, we had no idea they were coming behind us. We told her that we didn't even have any of the food we ordered and she yelled at us ""you guys had alcoholic drinks!"" We told her we did not have any alcoholic drinks and she continued to accuse us of having some and said there was a Georgia peach on the table. She obviously had no idea what was going on. We explained to her the situation and then she tried to offer us the food for free but we declined, we just wanted to leave at that point and grab a quick bite. I did not appreciate her escalating the situation and being hostile with kids around. I can't make this stuff up people, dine with caution."
Don C.,"Danville, CA",5,15,11,1.0,6/2/2017,There is reason why this chain doesn't maintain high reviews and its because they continue to fail at the basics. The latest is taking our leftover pizza and stacking the slices while the cheese is still hot and therefore glueing three pieces together. Thanks Cheesecake Factory.
Kelley S.,"Irvine, CA",220,82,58,5.0,6/26/2017,Great Food as Always; Wait Service was Prompt/Precise and Courteous. Very Happy with Today's Visit.
Paul V.,"Brentwood, CA",170,424,423,2.0,6/22/2016,"Picked up my mom at Stone Valley Mall and we were inclined to have dinner at The Cheesecake Factory. Luckily, we had just beaten the Monday (!) dinner crowd by a few minutes and were promptly seated. I had Chicken Madeira and my mom had some Crispy Crab Bites.  The one gripe I have with Cheesecake Factory is that it take an eternity to get to your food. I really thought that since we beat the dinner rush, we would have our food and an above than average time. When you keep on looking on you your watch, you know that you have waited for your food too long. And what is somewhat a let down is that beyond the elegant and chic decor, the quality and taste of TCF food is no better than your local Chill's or Applebee's. Our sever was prompt and courteous, and their cheesckaes (which we ordered to go) are impecable. But my overall experience plus a medicore state docks one star down to two for The Cheescake Factory."
Becky B.,"Tracy, CA",35,19,2,4.0,12/13/2017,This is a once or twice a year treat. Expensive so be prepared. And dont be in a hurry. Menu is extensive. Portions are crazy big service is classy. I recommend the apps. Main course fav pinepple chicken and shrimp
