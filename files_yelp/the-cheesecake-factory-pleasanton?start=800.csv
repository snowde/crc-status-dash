Lori L.,"Manteca, CA",10,4,,2.0,2/2/2016,"I have been there twice. Very nice restaurant. The first time I ordered Shrimp taco's there was not much flavor in the shrimp but was a personal request. My daughter had the Orange Chicken, I tasted it and it was very good.  The chicken had a good orange glaze it and  chicken was crispy. So the next time I went I ordered the Orange Chicken. It did not come with white rice it was brown rice. It was more spicy than I remembered and it was not the same glaze I had before. I told the waitress and her answer was ""the chef must of had a heavy hand."" Shouldn't the dishes be consistent to know what you are ordering? I took most of it home."
Shiela T.,"San Francisco, CA",251,278,878,4.0,2/11/2011,"Normally, I try to avoid writing reviews for franchises but I have to take a moment and praise Cheesecake Factory for such a delicious Red Velvet Cheesecake.  Shame on me for just now discovering this!  I've been dining at CF for years and each time I've always ordered the same exact meal - my Herb Crusted Salmon w/ a Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake for dessert. Oh, and I can't forget about my refreshing Passion Fruit Iced Tea .... it reminds me so of the week I spent in Maui eons ago. ((Initiating dream sequence)) OK.. back to reality, Shiela! Ever since Sprinkles Cupcakes introduced me to Red Velvet (or as I often refer to it as 'heaven in my mouth') I've gone all over the bay trying different bakeries, cafes, diners - basically any eatery to compare their Red Velvet but Cheesecake Factory scored high on my satisfactory scale. The cheesecake frosting is not too sweet or overwhelming and the cake itself is so moist and then they go and top it off w/ grated white chocolate...... ""10""!!!!!!   Thank you Cheesecake Factory for the extra calories that I willingly intake per each visit but it's SO worth it!!!! A few extra miles on the treadmill will cure the guilt.  HAPPY VALENTINES!!!"
Nicole V.,"Turlock, CA",0,11,16,2.0,2/15/2015,"The only reason I'm not giving this place 1 star is because of their cheesecake. Their actual food was horrible :( Dinner for 2 turned out to be $75 and their steak was as small as my fist which had no flavor. The chicken from my pasta was dry and hard. Very disappointing. Their cheesecake was amazing. Which is the only thing I was happy with but other than that, I do not recommend this place for a delicious dinner."
Linda H.,"Sunol, CA",9,2,,1.0,3/12/2015,"We had the worst restaurant experience ever tonight at the Pleasanton location! We (3 of us) were seated promptly but that is where our service ended.  Our server brought our beverages (water) and just put them on the table and dropped our bread off on the fly.  After 10 to 15 minutes took our order, left for 3-5 minutes then came back to confirm our order.  We waited over 35 minutes for our meal.  2 of our 3 meals were delivered.  Both were a bit dried out as if they had been sitting under the warmer too long.  After another 10-15 minutes we were able to get our servers attention to find out where our third meal was.  She returned a few minutes later with our last dinner, set it down and said ""it was just sitting there"". Our waters were empty at that point and we asked for refills and more bread which was handled promptly. Then we got our check.  She dropped it off and disappeared for several minutes.  The check she left at our table was not ours!  When we got her attention she took it back and brought us the correct check and some other guest's credit card.  Our check had been charged to someone else's card!  We asked to speak to the manager and walked the card to the server to point out the problem.  We could see her talking with her manager at this point.  She brought a final correct check to us.  We paid our bill with a gift card and left the restaurant with a very bad opinion of The Cheesecake Factory.  We expressed this to the manager once again as we left, receiving an apology.  We have never left a table without leaving a tip until tonight. Joe and Linda"
Lily I.,"Manteca, CA",173,5,,4.0,2/14/2015,"Came here earlier tonight with my boyfriend at around 10 and we got sat right away. All the hosts were very welcoming, wish I got their names! And we were sat at not the most comfortable table but I also work in a restaurant as a host so I'm not picky and totally understand. Our servers name was Tyler. He was awesome! He made great suggestions that we tried and both loved. The only con we had though was that my boyfriends salmon dish did come out cold and under cooked but Tyler got right on it and had the kitchen remake it for him. Plus the manager on duty took care of that issue promptly as well for us. Other than that, everything was amazing. Tyler brought us water without even asking at the greet I was impressed and our appetizers and entrees came out super fast. It was a great experience!"
Deepti R.,"Castro Valley, CA",52,54,7,4.0,9/28/2010,"This place is always packed!!! The wait for 3 people was 20 mins, went to the bar and got a pina colada which tasted really good and was big. Total for stella artois and pina colada was $13. 20 mins went by and then we were seated in a booth. Our server was STIX, nice lady with good knowledge of the food. By the way their menu is huge- and pretty overwhelming. It is hard to choose what you wanna eat. Atlast I got the salmon with mashed potatoes and asparagus. STIX goes you want lunch portion or dinner, chose dinner (next day lunch). The salmon I ordered was succulent and really tasty, and was good even when I warmed it for lunch the next day. Brother got the steak with mashed potatoes. His steak was somewhat like a patty, it was made out of ground meat, soft and flavorful. Boyfriend ordered Cuban sandwich, which was really good.  The food filled me fast, thought that they were kinda little buttery. Still it was really good and service on time and excellent."
Jericho L.,"Dublin, CA",131,5,,5.0,10/24/2013,"Though I do not eat at cheesecake factory much, from my experiences there those few times, I must say it does take the cheesecake. (Get it?)  Let's separate this into parts as to why I think it deserves a 5 star rating.  Wait time: Depending on the day and time that you go your wait time can range from 1 minute to maybe an hour or so. *Sundays are the worse cause that is everyone's off day. I personally enjoy going on slow days like Tuesday, especially since its much quieter and easier to talk without the russel and bussel in the background*  Service: I think all their waiters are amazing, and so patient. Each time they pass by there is always a smile (a genuine one at that) and they are pretty quick with attending to your needs. I do not recall a time I had to reask/repeat myself on what I needed, even on them busy sundays the workers are on top of their service.  Menu: I usually go for their pastas, but from the looks of it they have a good variety for whatever you're craving for. My father orders steak often, he can be picky with how well the meat was prepped but from seeing that he literally scarfs it down in just a few minutes goes to show that he enjoys them steaks.  *Side note: I do enjoy they personally grain pepper for you, adds to the ambiance.*  Cost: I myself go only on paycheck day, or when there is a special reason to be there. I have not just randomly decided to go to Cheescake factory 'just because'. It may be pricier for me, but with everything listed above you feel as if you get your money's worth.  Desert: I decided to put desert as its own separate category. Mainly cause, well its cheesecake factory and this is what they're known for. The amount of variety in their deserts is unreal and very impressive. It get anxious just thinking about it. They basically have so much variety that everyone can get their own specific one and no one would get the same order (well for my family)"
Preet S.,"Cory, CA",0,9,,1.0,1/4/2016,Ok I am never coming back here... Used to be one of my favorite places but tonight they just ruined it... The server was rude... We asked for jelepenos on our flatbread which he obviously forgot... Pasta was so under cooked it gave me a stomach ache... I guess Monday night is not the time to be here
Katherine F.,"Livermore, CA",382,1125,195,4.0,5/12/2010,"This is not fine dining, but it is still a step above Chili's, or Appleby's.  We have been here with family and friends for many celebrations, and girl lunches. They have a huge menu.  The portions are gigantic....so do split!! Case in point, DD and I split a special salad today, and only ate three quarters. Service has been varied....all the way from stellar to just OK...our most frequent complaint is the speed at  which our server responds to our wants.  We have no atrocities to report. Get here early...it fills up quickly...and I will not wait for extended periods of time!! It really pleases a crowd...with the bonus of dessert!!"
Huong T.,"Tracy, CA",0,3,,1.0,7/25/2016,"I would give them 0 stars if I could. My son and I used to come here all the time for dinner, but recently, this place has been rapidly declining in terms of service and food. Their service is slow and extremely disorganized. Their salmon is undercooked and juices flow from it into the white rice, which makes the whole plate very fishy and unappetizing. One time, I ordered asparagus and they gave me something that was gray and extremely soggy. When I tried to pick it up, it just broke apart. I asked them to replace the asparagus and they gave me broccoli that was also graying and soggy. At that point, I was sure that they they were serving other people's old food to us, which is extremely dangerous and puts us at risk for saliva-transmitted diseases. I wish they would go back to how they were a couple years ago. Please be careful if you go here. If anyone has leftovers, please take them home or break it apart so that they cannot re-serve your food to someone else. 0 STARS FOR BAD SERVICE AND BAD FOOD."
Jason T.,"Castro Valley, CA",1,10,,3.0,5/17/2015,"We don't usually come here to eat unless we HAVE to go to the mall for something. Our trip for brunch today was mediocre, immediately upon sitting down I noticed the utensils were filthy, not dirty!, filthy! I got a whiskey smash that had little to no alcohol in it. For an $11 cocktail  I should taste some form of alcohol. Why do they put bread on the table with cold butter, lol, you can't spread cold butter. Whatever , I see why we don't go out of our way to come here. Food was decent."
Wilson l.,"Castro Valley, CA",119,38,20,5.0,6/22/2011,"I always come here but i think its about time to make a review. I never really had any complaints about this place. You usually don't have to make reservations because it only takes like 10-20 mins to get a table. The servers are nice and decently fast.  The Cheesecake Factory is located in Stoneridge Mall, so even if you had to wait you can go into the mall to shop. They have many types of food choices from pasta to pizza to burritos. They usually start you off with two half loafs of bread which is FREE! The last time I was there, I got a spicy chicken chipotle pasta. The portion was for lunch and it was still really big. The sauce tasted really good and pasta was cooked perfectly. I would come back here to eat in the future."
Liz M.,"Pleasanton, CA",90,193,3,4.0,4/18/2013,"This review is a little bit biased because I know I'm not a HUGE FAN of American food, but for those who do enjoy it, Cheesecake Factory is the way to go. Also, I happened to be with a friend who does not like chicken or shrimp. Now mind you, I did not know this little tidbit about my friend until we got there and was surprised that I never noticed how few options there are for people who may not eat chicken or shrimp! We ordered the Spicy Ahi Tuna Roll and Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic. I actually really loved the Spicy Ahi Tuna Roll. It was so unique - totally americanized Japanese food, but good. The Farfalle was delicious and the chicken was juicy and tender (even my chicken disliking friend had to admit it was good).  We also ordered the Pomegranate Mojito which I'd had before but this time seemed a bit sweeter than usual. Regardless! I good drink nonetheless and with generous liquor portions ;) If I get a weird hankering for American food, I'll be back. :)"
Shianne D.,"Bay Area, CA",82,193,40,4.0,5/4/2012,"YUMM YUM IN MY TUMM! Do you have to wait an hour to be seated?  Most likely. Are the tables cramped real close to each other so everyone can hear your convo? Yuuup. Is it pricey? Mhmn. Is it derrrishuuuus???? Hellz yes! Hellz yes the food here is deliciosooooo! I've never had anything I didn't like here (hii, that's kind of a big deal). We like to get the breaded artichoke hearts with lemon aioli dipping sauce for an appetizer, and we usually get one of their salmon or chicken dishes.  I can't even point anything else specific out because we haven't had anything ""meh"" here so far! & even though the prices are high, sometimes we just split one meal because it's honestly too much food for one person to eat! Or if we're craving different things then we get seperate meals, box them up and they make a good dinner for the next night! I only did minus one star because it is so busy and so crowded that even though we enjoy what they have here it kind of makes it a hassle to come at all."
Lupe M.,"Oakland, CA",35,262,1,4.0,7/23/2012,"Though the menu offers an extensive array of dishes, I come here for one thing only, the cheesecake!   Choosing which flavor cheesecake to order is always difficult.  This time we all shared three cheesecakes:  the Ultimate Red Velvet Cake cheesecake made of moist layers of red velvet cake and cheesecake covered with cream cheese frosting (it was out of this world!), Dulce de Leche Caramel cheesecake topped with caramel mousse on a vanilla crust (it just melts in your mouth!), and the Vanilla Bean cheesecake made of layers of creamy vanilla bean cheesecake, vanilla mousse and whipped cream (it was so buttery and soft!)."
Sunny S.,"San Ramon, CA",0,7,,4.0,1/15/2015,This location is better the one in San Jose.  Seating is more spacious and it has a row of window seat looking out to the rest area.  Staff here is friendly and food is good.  Will come back another time.
Monchchichi H.,"East Oakland, Oakland, CA",19,3,4,1.0,10/4/2015,"Come here with family for sunday Brunch. The waited wasnt long for table. But the food take like 15-20 minute to come. My husband order Pasta w shrimp and sausage, he found out the shrimp was COMPLETELY RAW after he dig in few bites. We told our waiter and he said he going to report to his manager, and take away the plate without an APOLOGY. My husband waited another 10minute for them to remake it, and he told them to put it to go since all of us finished our plates. We got our bill and surprisingly they still charge the RAW SHRIMP plate. We asked our server and he said everything is right. He did double check with the manager before he bring it to us. Then he get the manager come to talk to us, and the manager said the bill was right because they remake the new plate for my hubby but they only charge us only one plate instead of two....SERIOUSLY???? That is the most RIDICULOUS thing we ever experienced from any of the restaurant. We will NEVER RETURN to this place anymore. Not EVEN ONE APOLOGIZE from the server or the MANAGER. What a way nice way run BUSINESS."
Manny M.,"Castro Valley, CA",15,147,10,1.0,6/22/2014,"Before you all get your panties in a bunch, the 1 star is for the horrible rib-eye steak I ordered. I got it medium-well like I asked, but the steak was the worst cut ever in my life for a rib-eye! Tough and chewy like a tire, this cut had gristle which I know should not be there. I left there with my jaw hurting, felt like my teeth were gonna fall out. The rib-eyes I grill from Costco melt in your mouth and there is NO gristle, Cheesecake Factory needs to fire their meat vendor. Just one reason we normally do not like going to chain restaurants. 5 star for service though. Should've had the chicken picatta like I originally planned. Oh well, should've, could've, would've! And cut down on the pepper on the green beans."
Leah B.,"Pleasanton, CA",94,155,487,3.0,3/11/2011,"-1 Star for coming here with only my son and I...since he had a craving for those Fried Mac & Cheese Balls...and not ordering a lot , but by the time our tab came for us both ended up being $50 and we shared a Keylime Mango Cheesecake, which was yummy I may add....They should really do a Kids Menu, then I'd probably come in more. Another -1 for being a little too dim lighting around dinner time....I have a degree in Merchandising so I totally get it with the Low Lighting Concept for nicer restaurants...But I swear it was hard to read the menus. Always have Great Service :)"
Samantha H.,"Martinez, CA",0,3,,4.0,1/9/2015,Mark was very helpful and concerned about making our visit there as easy as possible. He improvised to serve our needs and is a very outstanding waiter. The salmon was delicious but the pasta; nah. Strawberry cheesecake always hit the spot! Def. be back!
