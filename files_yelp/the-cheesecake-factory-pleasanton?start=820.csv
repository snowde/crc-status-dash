Megara P.,"Tracy, CA",0,14,,5.0,7/7/2014,Amazing cheesecake!!!! And their four cheese pasta is soooo delicious!! I love this place!!! I will definitely be coming back!!
Christine T.,"Pleasanton, CA",142,436,68,3.0,1/29/2013,"*3.5 stars* Sorry, just can't round up to give them 4 stars... Auntie O. treated me to a belated birthday brunch last weekend. We arrived around noon-ish and was surprised that our wait was *only* 15 minutes. Not bad at all. We shared the grilled artichoke which is on their skinny menu and it was surprisingly good! I ordered two apps: ahi tartare and Vietnamese ""tacos"". Both were really good. Too bad the ahi tartare was lacking in the ahi department and was fluffed with avocado (not necessarily a bad thing). For dessert, I was persuaded by our server to order the white chocolate macadamia nut cheesecake. It was only OK. The mac nut ended up tasting and crunching on the stale side which really ruined it for me."
Johnnie G.,"San Ramon, CA",0,28,,3.0,11/16/2014,"More like 3.5, only because our server tried real hard.  My mistake, Friday at 7?, should have known better. 1 hour wait, 10 minutes to get drinks, a few mistakes with the food..now I remember why this is an only once a year place."
Sarah B.,"Chicago, IL",252,249,126,4.0,10/20/2010,"This place is your standard, chain style restaurant.  It's clean, the staff is friendly, and the food is just fine.  Of course, the cheesecake here is always amazing.  My number one favorite item on the menu is the avocado egg rolls.  I gave this place four stars because when I think of other similar restaurants, like Claim Jumper, I like Cheesecake Factory better.  Cheesecake Factory is also much better than Fridays or Applebees.  I also like that they have half-size portions available during lunch. The seared ahi salad is always really good.  I wouldn't really suggest a burger here.  They're just okay, nothing special about them at all.  Other favorites from here include:  Stuffed Mushrooms, Hand Battered Onion Rings, and my all-time favorite entree item  MISO SALMON!!   Foods I'm not a fan off include their Samosas, and as I mentioned before, their burgers."
Wendy W.,"San Jose, CA",126,386,748,3.0,1/4/2013,"Came here with a group of girls to catch up after my long vacation last night... One of which went in at 4:30 and asked for reservations at 5:30--party of 8.  All was set and she waited there the entire time...  I was in the mall walking around and showed up just after 5:30 (not knowing that she actually made confirmed reservations) and we chatted and waited... around 6ish... we were wondering how much longer.. and the hostess said they were just cleaning the table.. so we patiently waited... and continued chatting away... around 6:30 we approached and asked again... and they said they were going to check on the table... we stood next to them and waited... and 5 or so minutes later we asked.. and another woman replied and said they tried to buzz and call us at 5:30 until 5:40 and no one responded.. which TOTALLY wasn't true.. and I know this for a fact because I got a call shortly after I arrived.. so I have the record on my phone that I was at the restaurant before 5:35.  A short while later, we were seated (it was already 6:45).  The rest of the stay was okay... I would actually say it was pretty good.. The waiter was friendly and patient as we took a little while to decide what we wanted.. I got the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta which was pretty good.. .except that I was expecting spicy... but I didn't think it was spicy at all... I also ordered two cheesecakes to go.. which came in a timely fashion. A friend had asked for an item to go on a separate bill--which they didn't do (but overall, I guess it wasn't that big of a deal)...  I would have normally considered giving this place 4-stars because the experience AFTER we were seated was pleasant and the food was good... but after learning that we did have confirmed reservations at 5:30 and then having someone first tell us they were clearing the table which wasn't true and then someone else telling us that we weren't there when they called for us which also wasn't true docked a star.. I would have rather they be honest with us and tell us the table they had for us hasn't cleared or whatever the true reason was.. pushing the blame onto us and lying just doesn't seem right to me..."
Nilesh S.,"Santa Clara, CA",5,16,1,4.0,1/30/2015,Awesome food and great service !!!!! the only bad thing is loooooooooong queue and servers helping their friends to get a table first.
Thanh T.,"San Jose, CA",110,199,55,4.0,12/29/2012,"Met a client here for dinner the other night in the chilly weather and the wait was too long so we sit outside in the patio. It wasn't too bad since they have the heat stand. Cheesecake Factory is a good place to go for consistent food, nice decor, and it doesn't cost an arm and a leg.  We ordered the Vietnamese Taco, Cuban Sandwich, Fish Taco, and Over-The-Over? I think that's what it's call but it's a Meatloaf Sandwich. The Vietnamese Taco was good, wrapped in a banh bao *it's the bun that comes with Peking Duck* and veggies you find in Vietnamese sandwiches, and pulled pork. I got the Meatloaf sandwich which is pretty good. They packed with a good amount of Meat Loaf and comes with a sweet, tangy, tomato sauce.  I haven't had a bad experience at many Cheesecake Factory locations in California. They have a variety of food from different cultures so it's a nice place to take family or friends who might not want to eat American food."
E. F.,"Walnut Creek, CA",113,34,63,5.0,10/29/2012,This location has the best customer service. Especially compared to Walnut Creek. It's like night and day. Great staff. Prompt. Smiling. Good food. If you look around the staff love working here and it shows on their faces. Walnut Creek needs to learn from Pleasanton.
Leana L.,"San Francisco, CA",322,889,281,3.0,10/5/2010,"This place is a typical American restaurant - decent prices, huge portions, and ridiculously high calorie counts per dish. However, it's a nice place to have a meal because of the consistency in service and taste. Additionally, their creative cheesecake flavors are delicious! Today we went to celebrate my sister's birthday. Unfortunately, they don't take reservations, and on a Tuesday night, at around 7:15pm, we had to wait 30 minutes to be seated! Granted, the place was pretty busy, and there were others waiting around for tables to free up, but the turn over rate wasn't very high. Anyways, our waitress was great and took our drink orders immediately while we looked over the menu. I had the pear and endive salad (with the dressing on the side and no blue cheese). My mom had the salmon (that came with mashed potatoes and onion strings), my dad had the bang bang chicken and shrimp, and my sister had the thai chicken pasta. Our entrees came out without a hitch in a reasonable amount of time (amongst our conversation, I wasn't bored waiting for the food because it came out rather quickly). My salad was good - I loved the pecans and the spicy dressing. I still have half left over for lunch tomorrow, though. My mom's dish was good, too. She enjoyed it and let me try a bite of the mashed potatoes and the potato strings. The mashed potatoes were definitely buttery! I had a tiny, tiny bite and I could totally taste the butter. The potato strings were limp and greasy, so I tore off a small piece and just left the rest. My dad's dish was of course tasty (each time someone orders it, they're always satisfied with it!). My sister also enjoyed her dish, which was reminiscent of pad thai. For dessert, my sister ordered one of the new specialty cheesecakes, the pina colada cheesecake. My mom ordered the white chocolate raspberry cheesecake. Both were quite tasty, but I would definitely recommend the pina colada cheesecake. Alternating layers of pina colada-soaked cake and cheesecake make it light and refreshing. And in regards to my mom's selection, of course, you can't go wrong with raspberry! The cheesecake factory is a nice restaurant to go to every now and then. This location consistently has good service and good food, but it's nothing special unless you're craving one of their dishes specifically, or are in need of a cheesecake fix."
James Q.,"San Ramon, CA",14,268,62,4.0,3/9/2013,"The last time I was ever in a Cheesecake Factory was over 15 years ago down in Southern California.  I was not impressed as I thought the menu was unimaginative and the food just so-so.  But, on this visit, I thought the food was very good and the menu was very extensive and varied.  There's something for everyone and every taste. I had a cup (really a bowl) of Clam Chowder to start with and except for being slightly thicker than I like, it was pretty good - good clam flavor and a nice flavor for the soup part.  Then we had Crab Cakes and these were excellent.  They had lots of crab meat and not much filler and the exterior had a nice crispy crust - good flavor and good textures. I had the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta with chicken and shrimp.  The pasta was al dente linguine and the sauce was very nice - slightly spicy but nicely balanced and lots of the chicken and shrimp.  The chicken was all white meat but it was moist and flavorful. My wife had the fish tacos and she had a choice of grilled or deep fried.  She chose the grilled and she thought they were very good - good enough that she would order them, again. We finished with a shared Reese's Peanut Butter Cheesecake.  It is a large slice so we ended up taking home more than half of my pasta and about half lf the cheesecake..  Yup, large portions is pretty much a standard thing, here. And to top it off, the prices were very reasonable.  Combine this with the large portions, good food and good service and nice ambiance, this is an excellent value. We will be going back!!! JIm"
Faith M.,"Hayward, CA",28,9,1,5.0,6/9/2012,"The Food Is Amazing!!! I try something new every time I frequent this establishment and am never disapointed. The service is Great even when their busy, which they usually are. Trust that this is the place to be even if you have to wait a while. They serve the best wheat bread to every table no charge. The only downside is that their menu is a novel of choices. The desert slices of cake can endulge a family of four alone. Aside from the linen tablecloths and napkins the artwork of the walls, ceilings, and pillars will have you searching for the ellusive black snake the artist has hidden in each and every CCF restaurant. A good choice for groups of all sizes. A little pricey but for the portions and flavor you get every cents worth."
Elena T.,"Dublin, CA",0,91,,2.0,5/18/2015,"I really want to like this place, because their menu is the BOMB!! But they just can't seem to get it together. The last 2 times we have been there, they lose at least one order.  We went on a Saturday around 11 and there was no one there. We were one of the first tables seated. An HOUR went by, and we still didn't have our order. The place had filled up with people that came in after us were almost done, and we still had no food. And our waiter was NO WHERE to be found. Finally our food comes and he has some lame excuse they lost our order. It would have been nice if he would have just come over and told us that. And there was really no apology or anything.  I was there again a couple weeks ago at 4 in the afternoon and we were sitting in the bar area. Again, hardly anyone in there. There were 3 of us at the table. Part of an order came out for one person...we waited...and waited. Finally we told her to eat. Then they brought the second order...and we waited and waited...then they brought the remainder of the first order. And AGAIN our waiter was no where to be found. They were both almost done when mine finally came. And when the waiter FINALLY showed us, he said they made the wrong order. So...he knew the kitchen or someone screwed up, but he couldn't just come out and let us know? As much as I like the menu, I doubt i will ever come back. It's a waste of money to have a bad dining experience every time. I was really excited to have this place up the street from us, but If we feel the need for Cheesecake factory again, we will probably just drive to Walnut Creek."
Mary Jane P.,"Hayward, CA",142,458,166,5.0,3/1/2012,"I gave up carbs, alcohol and beef for lent. So when me and my friend came here for dinner I thought it would be a challenge. It wasn't one bit. I ordered the ahi tuna tartar for appetizer just skipped on the fried won tons. Then ordered the herb crusted salmon with asparagus and substituted the mashed potatoes for salad. I asked for the balsamic vinaigrette which was the best dressing I have ever tasted!!!  They even sell the salad dressing to go so our course I bought a jar."
Rose A.,"Daly City, CA",368,622,3017,4.0,10/10/2010,"My family, friends and I came for dessert. They have a huge selection of cheesecake and they all sound fabulous! You can't go wrong with the classic Vanilla Bean cheesecake and the Fresh Banana Cream cheesecake tasted just that - fresh - and it wasn't overly sweet.  I had the Reese's Peanut Buttercup. This one is good but in small doses as it is really rich! It's the perfect once-a-month cure for a woman going thru some thangs, if you know what I mean.  I don't normally give places 5-stars but our server Erik W (if I remember from our bill correctly) deserves 5 stars! He checked up on us just enough and was so knowledgeable about their products. He described each cheesecake we asked about as if he were talking about a fine wine, which was really impressive. He also gave good suggestions and even even kept us updated on the score for the Giants game. People usually frequent large chain restaurants without giving it much thought but Erik made this particular dining experience a memorable one."
Lee J.,"Hayward, CA",19,307,444,3.0,1/16/2013,"It was really hard to give this place more than 3 stars. Although the restaurant was crowded and we had to eat outside in the cold(heated lamps), I can't complain too much. The food was great but of course I can't stand the prices. The 2 waitress we had were nice but one of them seem to had totally forgot about us. We waited 30mins plus for our dessert and bill and was handed the wrong bill.  I know my review seems like I am the type that would root for a bad guy in a movie because this is the ""Cheesecake Factory""! You don't hear too many to no bad thoughts about this place but I don't sugar coat anything. Overall good experience with some bumps."
Jennifer Y.,"Palo Alto, CA",1,33,2,1.0,5/8/2015,I patiently waited for an hour to get a table only to be seated outside in a cold. The hostess in the front put me on the list for outside.  I've never experience this before.  I felt discriminated as no one else was getting this treatment. When I told them I wanted inside seating had to wait 20 minutes. Note they discriminate not coming back!
Craig M.,"Spokane, WA",0,43,,3.0,11/30/2014,"Know what you're getting into when you eat here.  The food is ok at best.  The service is hit and miss. Some wait-staff are quite good, some are bad. It is always crowded.  Always.  So you'll have to wait.   As I mentioned, the food is ok.  I have eaten there many times out of convenience and some dishes are better than others.  Stay away from the spaghetti and meatballs.  The shrimp and pasta is decent.  Their salads are quite good.   If you are meeting people, this is a good and convenient place.  If you want a good dining only experience, there are better choices close by."
LPthang S.,"Berkeley, CA",30,254,65,4.0,3/28/2014,"Went here for a bday celebration, waitress was good. I felt she could have been better, it was packed as always. Food is just okay to me, I'm not crazy about the food. However buffalo blast never fails me, the wait was a long time, over the 20 mins that was told to us... Until next time."
Aimee L.,"Hayward, CA",117,261,1,3.0,2/17/2012,"Saturday evening wait is an 1 hour and quickly jumps to 2 hours as the night goes on.  We waited an hour and when our pager went off we turned it in and they called lots of names, but not ours.  After we said something the kid said someone took our table.  But I think that was his excuse because looking at his screen it looked like he just skipped over us.  They tried to make up for it and gave us a table right away. After complaining to a manager he offered a free appetizer, but failed to tell our waiter it was free.  So that all sucked, but our waiter was great.  I think his name was Chuck.  The meal was delicious and we had a good time after we were seated.   Word to the wise, don't come on a Saturday evening unless you want a long wait in a very crowded lobby."
Em S.,"Hayward, CA",111,79,32,5.0,2/18/2014,One of my favorite spots to have dinner. YES to the Cheesecake Factory! :)
