Kevin Y.,"Flowery Branch, GA",207,456,963,5.0,9/1/2012,"You never know about a restauarant from one to another when they are all over the country. Had lunch here with a client, my Director from the UK loved it! We had a vegetarian, I had the seared Tuna salad ( fantastic!!!) and my mate from the UK had something from the skinnylicious menu... also great. Good service and ""listening"" from EMMA our server and all in all, great lunch. Probably have breen to CCF 20 times and don't think I have ever had cheese cake ( sorry.... not a big desert eater) but people need to know they have great food. Good job. Thanks for my only good meal in 2 weeks!"
Susana G.,"Livermore, CA",5,55,,3.0,7/21/2015,"I have never had a bad experience here until yesterday.  My daughter and I went to dinner last night. The server was great. We did not have to wait for a table and that was a wonderful.  I ordered the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp and that was good.   My daughter ordered the pulled pork Sandwich. She was not happy because the pork was very cold and wanted it heated. It took a while to get the server back to our table. It is not the servers fault, they are always busy here. She returned it and the manager came over to apologize and said we can have dessert on them. That was very nice and made us happy.  The problem is by the time her meal arrived I was done and my plate was gone.  So she wanted to take it home because she was no longer hungry with the bread and the fries she ate while waiting.  When we got home, every single slice (not pulled pork) was a slice of pork fat.  I do not recall that she order a pork fat sandwich but a pulled pork sandwich.  Not sure if this was done on purpose because we returned the cold one back.  So my complaint is with the kitchen staff."
Delilah H.,"Hayward, CA",58,22,37,1.0,5/27/2015,"Let's see where do I start. We asked for water while we look at the menu. She brings us the water a spills one of the waters all over the table and two of our guest. Ok, accidents happen. Then she brings us a stack of napkins and walks away! Really!?! Your not going to clean the mess you made or have a bus boy come. Nope! Then after WE cleaned her mess. I asked for a Strawberry Lemonade. She brings a regular lemonade. I asked can I have what I ordered and she rolls her eyes and walks away! She takes the lemonade away and then a different server brings me Str. lemonade. Now let me fast forward to the bill. She charged me for both lemonades. Now we are pissed. Asked for the manager and here is the kicker! This A&$$ hole manager comes to the table and the 1st thing out of his mouth is. So you guys are harassing my server! What!!!! No how can I help you, what's the problem. Nope! Go here at your own risk! Service horrible. Managers are even worst. I will never go to this place again!"
Angie S.,"Santa Clarita, CA",63,22,14,4.0,3/23/2012,"I absolutely LOVE cheesecake factory!!!! It's probably my favorite restaurant. The only con is that there's always a long wait, but the food is amaazzingg! The portion sizes are huge so I usually share a plate with my boyfriend. The Chicken Bellagio is our favorite dish! We also order a small Caesar salad. We always leave with a full stomach :)"
Sara A.,"Pleasanton, CA",125,51,11,2.0,8/14/2014,I like the food here all of it I've yet to have something I didn't like except the onion rings were really soggy. This location is always really busy. Everytime we have been here it's really busy and packed and we wait too long to order or food. Several times my order has been wrong like a completely different dish and the prices are really high for simple dishes it's best to go during happy hour.
Janet D.,"San Jose, CA",104,1216,1381,5.0,8/19/2012,friendly staff and delicious cheesecake. My favorite red velvet cheesecake is sooo super amazing. I am in love with the herb lemon salmon and then the roasted herb chicken. Delicious! Will be back there again soon. Super friendly gluten free menu.
Chucky L.,"Milpitas, CA",13,30,6,4.0,7/18/2012,"Great service and ambiance! My fiancé and I was shopping at Macy's and decides to head over to CF for lunch. The day we went was a wonderful Summer weather, temperature in the mid-70s.  We ordered the lunch special of soup and salad with a sandwich. And the ultimate dessert raspberry cheesecake with coffee.  our wait was long but the estimate wait time was not a big deal.  We sat neat the mall entrance there were shaded bench chairs.  Our service was wonderful!"
Michael K.,"GLEN OAKS, NY",0,5,,5.0,8/9/2015,My family took my Dad here for his birthday. I had the spaghetti and meatballs which was very good and satisfied my New Yorker Italian food standards. Our waiter Marc S. was phenomenal. He has wonderful people skills and made our dining experience exceptional with his attentiveness. His recommendation of the Hershey's Cheesecake was loved by all and they sang a birthday song to my Dad!
Ediz E.,"Danville, CA",6,30,10,1.0,10/19/2015,"We enjoy visiting Cheesecake Factory ether family. Big menu but consistent. I took my mom for her birthday dinner w the rest of the family. I guess the service couldn't be worst. We got seated at 6:28 and received our appetizers at 7:12. Our waitress did not show up asking if we needed anything - she just disappeared. Then they served one of the main courses out of 7. Nothing else arrived for 5 min and then 2 more plates showed up. Everyone received their plates w small intervals. (Not sure if they have staff issue). At the end there was no meal served for my youngest one. By then the evening was ruined and everyone was frustrated. Too bad such establishments start w decent service but over time they lose biz because they  lose their Identity, forgetting about service relying on captive audience (mall visitors). Manager tried to fix the situation, gave couple of appetizer credit - insult to the injury! No more Cheesecake Factory!"
Francesca P.,"Livermore, CA",16,25,1,1.0,3/1/2015,"I would give zero stars if I could. The food is usually fine, but the wait. Is long. Today has been absolutely ridiculous! We gave our names at 3:20 and were told it would be 30 min. We were finally seated almost an hour later. We waited a little bit for a waitress to come by, and then ordered immediately. As we sat and sat, I watched tables who were seated after we ordered, getting food, finishing and leaving. Two of us had ordered egg dishes and one had ordered a burger so preparation could not have taken too long. When I complained, the floor manager came over with some explanation about the burger being overdone, and the order being completely remade. She did make some adjustment on the bill, it was not detailed so I am not sure by how much. By then I was so mad, that I did not enjoy my food and only wanted to leave."
Jackie Z.,"Modesto, CA",191,571,520,5.0,5/2/2014,"My family of 5 came on a Thursday evening to try appetizers and desserts. Our waiter Cameron C was so hospitable. He was funny, super friendly, and knew what movie my sister and I were quoting and laughed at us and said we made his day. He came back once to tell us that something we had ordered they were out of and my Grandmother's tea was on him for that. What a gentleman! On to the scrumptious food!  Crispy Cuban Rolls~ WHOOOOOWEEEE these were bomb!Crispy wrappers filled with slow roasted pork, ham, melted swiss cheese, pickles and mustard. I would definitely get it again.  Fresh Baked Flatbread~ The fresh basil, tomato and cheese with mozzarella, fontina and parmesan cheeses. It was super light. I would probably wouldn't get this again unless I was coming in for dessert only and needed a little something before I dug into my dessert.  Roadside Sliders which were bite-sized burgers on mini-buns served with grilled onions, pickles and ketchup. These were pretty good. Perfect for a Snack.  Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes topped with sour cream, salsa, avocado and salsa verde.These were super delish,  I loved the sweetness and all the extras to top it off.  Then for dessert I had the Toasted Marshmallow S'mores Galore Cheesecake which was Hershey's® Cheesecake topped with chocolate ganache, finished with toasted house made marshmallow, Honey Maid graham crackers and whipped cream. OOOO it was to die for! I ended up bringing half of it home because it was so filling.  Can't wait to come back when I'm in Pleasanton again!"
Katie S.,"Las Vegas, NV",67,181,27,4.0,8/16/2012,"What can I say about The Cheesecake Factory that has not already been said.  Pretty decent and consistent quality food. Pretty decent and consistent quality service.  Sometimes you get a cook having an off day, sometimes you get a server having an off day. It happens. Overall, this location is a 4 star for me. I'm sure we will return when it comes time to shop at the Mall again :)"
Thuyvi M.,"Hayward, CA",713,853,632,4.0,8/4/2010,3.5 stars. Came here last night with my husband.  It was our first time.  I must say the restaurant is very nicely decorated and it was packed for a tuesday night. The prices are ok and the menu is huge.  Our waitress was awesome and checked on us at good increments.  Everyone that we came in contact with smiled and greeted us.  no attidudes or rudeness. One thing I did not like was the seating.  We were sat in the tables where your really close with other parties.  I could clearly hear everyones conversations and that was weird seeing this couple on a blind date trying to get to know each other lol.  that was freaking hilarious. Try to request a booth if eating here.  The service was pretty good and quick.   The food was average but I must say the fried zuchunni sticks were probably the best I ever had.  My husband order the filet mignon and he said it was really good but it was a little pricey.  I ordered the factory meatloaf and I must say I did not enjoy it.  I am used to ketchup on my meatloaf and their ML had brown gravy.  The seasoning was weird tasting to me.  the mashed potatoes were cold but the corn squash was delicious.  i wish i could of just ordered the corn squash.  theres a huge dessert menu becuz cheesecake is their thang.  The cheesecake slice menu to me is very pricy.  $7 to $8 a slice. I orderd the dulce de leche togo and enjoyed it this morning it was really good!
Johanna B.,"Beverly Hills, CA",10,10,,3.0,7/6/2014,I usually love going to the Cheesecake Factory until last time. About 3 weeks ago took my kids for lunch and my son ordered pasta and meat sauce. About 15 min later the server comes over telling us they don't have the meat sauce and he needs to order something different and he gives us a list of the things in the menu that weren't available either. They were a few. My food and my other son's arrived but we were missing one. He ordered a burger and came when we had already finished our meal. They never apologized because of the time it took. I would've expected the dessert to be free.  My food wasn't good either. I always order the same... This time it was greasy and not as good as always... I know I should've complaint... But don't like to do it...
Nathan V.,"Long Beach, CA",414,3,3,3.0,6/12/2014,First of all they ran out of the wheat bread which was very disappointing. I order the cashew chicken which is one of my top 3 favorites. The brown rice was crunchy because it was not fully cooked. My first horrible Cheesecake Factory experience. I rarely complain but I spoke with the manager. He offered me a cheesecake but turned it down.
Mandy C.,"San Francisco, CA",217,534,149,4.0,3/31/2012,"Despite the fact that The Cheesecake Factory does not take reservation, and majority of their food are loaded with calories, after a long night of shopping, I'm glad this place is still opened and provided great services and food.  Expect to wait, it seems like there's always people waiting. If you're on a diet, The Cheesefacke Factory now has a ""skinnylicious"" menu that has yummy food for less than 500 calories. My favorite is the Ahi Tuna Salad, ask for the dressing on the side and you save another few calories there!  Oh, when your waiters and waitresses bring you bread, see if there's the brownish rye one because that one is SO good! Ask for it because they always run out and need to bake new ones. Add some melted butter with it and omg, that is like a meal of itself since it's sweet, warm and toasty, it's hard to stop eating.   Ask for the yummy fatty stuff, I love the artichoke dip for appetizer, and the Louisiana Chicken Pasta. For dessert, I love the Banana Cream Cheesecake because it's lighter than others. The white chocolate raspberry one was also delish!  The prices are on the more expensive side but the portions are huge, so it's like paying for two meals. Not bad for a place that serves variety of everything from every culture."
Faith A.,"San Francisco, CA",370,39,12,5.0,6/23/2012,"What can I say?  Was treated by a phenomenal server...Nicole?  I THINK that was her name.  She was all over my table like a woman with a mission.  I was impressed with her check backs, which most servers don't do.  Well, at least in MY opinion.  She was kind and was not a big fat phony.  But most of all, she gave me suggestions and gently led me to a higher priced item...yup...I went for it. THEN I find out that was her FIRST DAY OF NOT BEING A SHADOW!!  Basically, her first time flying solo.  Hmmm, I thought she was kidding, I thought she was a trainer! Thank you Tim. (GM) for hiring yet another outstanding person at the Cheesecake Factory"
Lisa T.,"San Francisco, CA",5,20,,4.0,10/11/2011,"Oh my the cheesecake here is nothing short of amazing. When i arrived with my friend on a Monday night, I was amazed at the line outside. We spent out time drooling over the cheesecakes they have displayed in the front. We noticed they had a seasonal pecan / pumpkin Cheesecake that we already decided we're getting before we even ordered our food.  Food was OK, but actually pretty expensive if you get an appetizer or two, you'll easily end up over $60 for two people, and this place isn't even that nice. BUT, the cheesecake was nothing short of amazing, it definitely made the night. The white chocolate macadamia nut is on the list for the next visit."
Michelle D.,"Hayward, CA",183,172,219,5.0,10/29/2009,"It's so worth the wait for a table. I've been here a numerous number of time. My boyfriend and I came here once and got their onion rings, spicy thai pasta and a slice of original cheesecake. The food came out perfectly and it tasted fantastic! Another time my friend and I came here after hours and hours of shopping, I accidentally ordered the wrong salad. I got a salad from the weight watchers menu when I really wanted their Asian Chicken Salad. The nice waiter took back the other salad and gave me the one I originally wanted and only charging me for one plate. How nice!  I love it here and I would definitely come back, especially for their cheesecake!"
Alex K.,"Saratoga, CA",142,484,20,4.0,7/14/2012,"Cheesecake Factory always gets 4 stars for me unless the service brings it down, which so far, never has. I love the assorted menu with too many things to choose from and then too much food so you have to take some home. Yay!"
