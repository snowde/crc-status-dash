J T.,"Alameda, CA",0,62,,2.0,3/9/2015,"It was a mistake to order from the Skinnylicious part of the Cheesecake Factory menu.  Portions were small and food was bland.  Prices for Skinnylicious dishes are as high as the regular menu.  Long 1 hour wait for a patio table (we asked for first available table), even on a late Sunday afternoon.  Very busy restaurant.  They gave us a buzzer that didn't go off when it was our turn, but good thing we were close enough to the reception desk to hear them.  Server was nice enough.  Restaurant is too busy, and food wasn't worth the wait."
Daniel D.,"Concord, CA",827,462,315,3.0,8/3/2012,"I think I've been here before but it was so long ago..  B R I E F  S U M M A R Y -- It's on the outside of the mall -- It's always busy -- Extensive menu -- Decent to big portions -- Not cheap -- Big groups usually wait a while even with reserved seating -- Bar area is cool if you don't want to wait for a table -- Service can be hit or miss -- Food is hit or miss but there's so many items on the menu I came here with about 20 coworkers for a going away party. I think we only waited about 45 minutes to get a table. It wasn't that bad plus everyone was drinking at the bar. Our server was very attentive. Given my experience with large groups at chains, I usually get bad service but she was great. She always kept my water filled (thanks). And she handled everyone's orders and requests. I guess it was just a good night. I ordered the Salisbury Steak with mashed potatoes and veggies. It came as I ordered and was very good. The only thing that I wish I had was more of it and more gravy but who doesn't want more? haha. I'm not much of a cheesecake fan so I passed on dessert. I also didn't like that the bread wasn't hot. It was just room temp. Overall the experience was very good but nothing blew my mind with excellence thus the 3 star review. Really it was 3.5 stars because our server was great. I'll be back here again given the right circumstances."
Riza K.,"Lodi, CA",79,54,10,4.0,10/19/2012,"Typical Cheesecake Factory, upscale, fancy, friendly, expensive, pretty easy to find. I loved the 30th Anniversary Cheesecake."
Josephine C.,"Oakland, CA",1,7,,5.0,9/28/2014,"My brother had dinner party last night and the service was perfect, the food was amazing!!! I loved the crab cakes so yummy and great dipping sauce too. Our server was Laura, she did such a great job my with my crazy family. The wait is a little crazy but it's worth it!!!!"
Landon E.,"San Ramon, CA",0,6,2,1.0,9/25/2015,"Dirty plates, slow service, food not so good (hard textured Vietnamese spring rolls that are supposed to be soft).  Been coming here for years and this place has deteriorated from what was a top notch food experience to a dining disappointment.  Seems to be a problem from the top.  I think I am done..."
Mr S.,"Ridgecrest, CA",0,14,4,1.0,8/17/2015,"Very disappointed. This is normally my favorite restaurant, but today was horrible. I came in and ordered the Steak Dianne and asked for it to be cooked medium and when it came to the table it was completely raw and not even rare. I didn't want to send it back because of all the horor stories you hear, but I did at the advise of the waitress. When it came back it tasted like it was microwaved. When I told the waitress it tasted like it was microwaved she argued with me and said it would never be microwaved. When I got my steak back it was the same piece of meat I took a bite off of. So if they did put it back on the grill like they told me they did, isn't that a health code violation.  I thought once something leaves the grill it can't return for safety reasons.  I sent it back for a different meal hopefully it won't be the same thing this time"
Gaby V.,"Dublin, CA",0,16,4,3.0,8/16/2014,"Favorite pasta is the Pasta Da Vinci! soo delicious! The service is pretty good, however the fried coconut shrimp on the appetizers is blehh"
Casey S.,"Benicia, CA",63,67,12,1.0,5/23/2015,"If I could rate it a 0 I would . Thinking this was a nice and some what fancy restaurant I was expecting at least a pretty decent meal . But that was far from the case. This experience was horrible . We decided to treat our selves to a nice meal after doing a 3 mile long mud run , and we definitely wish we went with the corn dogs and cheesy curly fries at the food stands after this experience . So the beginning was fine , our appetizers came out at a decent time and were good. Except we weren't given napkins or silver wear until our appetizers were half way finished , and our waitress definitely forgot about us multiple times . The bus boy helped us out the whole time instead of her . After finishing our appetizers it was around the 20 minute mark where I started to get ancy, being there for 45 minutes after we ordered is when my girlfriends food came out 10 minutes before ours and then when our food finally did come we were served bad steak , stale fries and cold food. Pretty shirty for a $90 bill ."
Diane W.,"STANFORD, CA",3,376,,3.0,8/14/2015,raw tuna was good so was tiramisu cheesecake
Mandy T.,"Sacramento, CA",3,23,1,1.0,8/18/2013,"THEY ARE SO RUDE. I ordered togo and some lady picks up. I order a Bellagio pasta without the meat and without the green leaves, the bitch tells me it's basil so I say fine, take that out, and you know what the bitch says? She asked, ""why do you eat it like that and not try something else?"" Who the fuck are you to ask me that? Just take my order you rude bitch. So I go pick it up, it's not the right fucking order and I tell the bitch I don't even want it because first of all, you were downright rude as fuck and then you didn't even get my order right. She took the basil oil out which wasn't even the leaves. She left the damn leaves in there. So another rudeass waitress goes, ""just tell someone to put the freaking oil in there!"" Excuse me bitch, shut the fuck up, no one was talking to you. Idk how the hell this restaurant has more than 3 stars when they're all fucking rude."
Donna Z.,"San Jose, CA",630,557,106,4.0,8/2/2009,"Yes, it's a chain restaurant. Yes, it's a little obnoxious. Yes, the portions are large enough to feed a small village. But honestly, in all the times I've been to CF, I've yet to have a meal that wasn't at least ""good"".  Their Luau Chicken Salad is one of the best salads I've ever had - thanks to the crispy wontons, sweet vinaigrette dressing and fresh bell peppers, cucumber, baby lettuce and white meat chicken. Seriously, you can't go wrong. And if the large portions disgust you, get there before 5pm to get their ""lunch portion"" - still large enough for 2 people, in most cases. The Luau Salad and their DELICIOUS, sugar-free tropical iced tea was exactly the nourishment I needed after a waaaay too busy bridal faire at the Pleasanton Hilton a couple miles away. Sitting on their breezy yet sunny patio on a Sunday with my mom, eating our salads and drinking iced tea? How could you give that less than 4 stars? Sure, the service was a little slow at times, but if you can't slow down on a Sunday, when can you? P.S. We got a slice of the new RED VELVET cheesecake to-go. I tried a bite and it is FANTASTIC. Official name - Stefanie's Ultimate Red Velvet Cheesecake. Five stars for this one! (I'm uploading a photo to make you drool). Plus, as if it wasn't good enough on its own, 25 cents from its sale goes to help stop hunger through the Feeding America Foundation."
Amanda S.,"Modesto, CA",0,15,7,5.0,6/10/2015,"We came here for our 5th anniversary, mentioned that casually to our waitress, no big deal. The waitress did an amazing job keeping up with our needs and she was so sweet. Unfortunately, I can't recall what her name is! We had our meal, which was fabulous! We tried the crab cakes, which are like Heaven, and the potstickers (also yummy) and I ordered the filet mignon, which is delicious and just melts. My husband, kids, and I needed multiple refills of our drinks, which were taken care of quickly. The only thing that was the least bit unsettling was that there was a bird inside the restaurant, and it would go up onto the light fixture and knock down dust. But that wasn't even a big deal. The sun was shining too brightly through the window we were sitting by, and they drew the blind for us within minutes of being seated. That was nice. At the end of our meal, our waitress surprised us and walked up to our table with an ice cream sundae that had ""Happy Anniversary"" written on the plate! It was the sweetest gesture and really made our day. The kids devoured it, and we were on our merry way. We were way too full for cheesecake, unfortunately, plus we had a drive home, otherwise we would have taken some to go. Next time I will leave room for dessert!"
Carina R.,"Newark, CA",0,535,,2.0,3/25/2014,"I remember when the Cheesecake Factory came to the Bay Area - at least the south and east bay - oh so long ago. Back then I loved it, but quickly became tired of always going there. I hadn't been there in a long time (like 5 or 6 years), until we got a gift card for here. Along with the gift card was a gift card for a free slice of cheesecake. So, my hubby and I came here for lunch this past weekend. It was like I remembered it. Their menu is way too long and they have the most unhealthy foods of all time. I just don't like that. I get it. It's a restaurant in America, so of course, it's going to be unhealthy. But with the amount of stuff on their menu and the horrible nutritional facts for ALL the foods, it just makes this place seem like a lie to me. Don't let their Skinny menu fool you. Its low in calories and high in sodium and sugar. You just can't win. Definitely not the place to go to when you want to eat healthy....but alas, we have the gift card. I ended up getting the lunch portion of the tomato and basil pizza and a side salad with balsamic. The hubby got some shrimp appetizer and the club sandwich with fries. He also ordered a drink from the bar that took forever to arrive. The excuse was that there was only one bartender. Here's an idea!...have two bartenders during the weekend when it's busier for most businesses. Overall, everything was mediocre. However, their namesake did not disappoint. I only had a few bites of the ultimate red velvet cheesecake and it was delicious, although very rich tasting. Their cheesecake is the devil, I'm sure. Nothing can taste that good and be that horrible for you all at the same time......"
Winnie M.,"San Ramon, CA",0,7,1,2.0,4/5/2016,"We came here on a Monday night with a bunch of our friends and it wasn't too busy. It took a while for our food to come out. I ordered the meat loaf and it was burnt... I'm not even sure why they even put it on a plate, considering how burnt it was (I wish I had took a picture, but it was way too dark in there).  I told them that my food was burnt and they asked me if I wanted them to make me another one or if I wanted to order something else and I told them it was okay because it would just take too long since we waited for a while already.  The manager came and talked to me, so I asked to have them remove my meal from the bill.  When we got the bill, they forgot to remove my meal off and they took another 5-7 minutes to get it fixed.  It took another 10 minutes to get our to-go cheesecakes as well.  I've been to other Cheese Cake Factorys and this was by far my worse experience.  I won't be returning here."
Renalen C.,"East Bay, CA",350,269,270,4.0,3/28/2012,"im a sucker for the cheesecake factory. but unfortunately if i give in to it often, my pants will give out. haha last cheesecake factory experience was at this location and i ordered their chicken tacos from their new special menu.   i was thrilled to see that they now had a ""skinnylicious"" menu where apparently the dishes were 560 cals or less.  though still a little hard to believe, seeing that its the freakin cheesecake factory.  they were pretty good nonetheless. but with a place like this, so good, so yummy, you just  have to not even think about the ridiculous amount of cals youre putting away and just eat. next time im there, its stuffen chicken tortillas for me all the way. noms."
Andrew W.,"Atlanta, GA",150,293,,3.0,1/9/2014,"The service here is always good and the food is decent. Portions are generous and the prices are fair. However today we had a hair in our fried pelota and a mini wooden bark in our fried avocado rolls. Although both dishes tasted wonderful, it makes one wonder about the consistency and cleanliness of the food. That being said I have come here multiple times before and it has always been fine. Ill take this experience as an ""off day"" for this restaurant. After notifying the waiter, the manager prompt came and gave us his sincere concerns. He was extremely polite, friendly and professional. He ended up taking the two dishes off our bill and apologized for the unpleasant experience. I would definitely come back to this place again and hopefully there wont be any unpleasant surprises next time around. Their customer service here should be a model for other restaurants."
JMark P.,"Napa, CA",3,53,,2.0,9/5/2012,"""It's like a friend who's kind of a hanger onner.  You forget why you like them so you keep hanging out with them"".  I've been to this place twice.  Once for take out and the other with 4 friends.  My friends and I venture into the cheesecake factory once in a while.  It's pretty much the same everywhere.  Good food, hit or miss service at best.  The prices are ok; not great, not bad.  But the prices for the cheesecakes are outrageous.   A regular plain 10 inch cheesecake is $42.  A 10 inch flavored cheesecake is $46-52.  Not cheap.  They also are extremely sugary.  I'm not a huge cheesecake fan but many people I know like it, but they will only buy it by the slice when they eat.  Extremely sweet.  Anyways, one time I went I had the Bacon cheeseburger and the other a  single pepperoni pizza.  Burger was great; fries were classic.  Crispy on the outside, not cooked on the inside.  I still don't get why some restaurants serve thick fries when they don't cook them right.  Pizza was great.  Other friends had 2 pasta dishes that they liked.  The server was ok but obviously busy.  Try to avoid busy times because you can wait a long time to get your food.  When I went there the second time I had a take out order.  I had a guinness at the bar and it took forever (30 minutes).  I was in a rush and got the bad and took off.  I didn't check the bag until I got home and of course they forgot my cheesecake. lol  omg.   I emailed the website and told them what happened and they sent me a $10 gift card which was very nice of them.  Pro's: -good, solid food -good bar selection Cons:  -Service is hit or miss.  Avoid busy times like after work. -popular cheesecake (but expensive if you buy a whole one)  It is what it is.  A national chain that serves pretty good food."
Alisha S.,"Hayward, CA",248,28,7,4.0,5/6/2014,This place is awesome (: sometimes the service can be annoying which is why it gets 4 stars but the food is amazing!!!!!!
Jessica S.,"Tracy, CA",12,29,,4.0,11/12/2013,"Walked in on a week night and didn't have to wait very long to be seated. In fact, we sat for about 2 minutes before our buzzer went off. Sat by the bar in a booth and had a great  waiter. Wasn't rushed to figure out our meals and received our food at a timely manner. Drinks were good and everything was prepared on time. Had a great time! Definitely recommend this restaurant to everyone. Just make sure you don't eat too much so you have room in your stomach for dessert!"
Desmond T.,"La Jolla, CA",144,322,5,1.0,12/25/2013,"Getting food poisoning on Christmas day is the best gift Cheesecake Factory can ever offer! I mean, how did they know that was what I truly desired? I ordered the Bang-Bang Chicken and Shrimp, but got Bang-Bang Diarrhea instead. Never returning to Cheesecake Factory ever again."
