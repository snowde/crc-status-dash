Angie T.,"Stockton, CA",30,18,4,1.0,10/18/2013,"Worst night of my life here. Waited over an hour  for our food and it was horrible. Food was wrong. Asked for veggies instead of pasta. Got it but it was in an Asian sauce. Doesn't go with chicken piccata very well. Server did not come by and apologize for how long it was taking for our food. The people next to us ordered when we got our food and when we were done eating, they got their meal served. Everything took so long and no apologies and acknowledgment of the time. Sat at 7:00, left at 9:00. Never going back again. If I wasn't starving and reject fast food, I would have left."
Marcus A.,"Pleasanton, CA",33,39,8,5.0,5/24/2014,"I work in Stoneridge and frequent this location. Food is always consistently good as well as above average service! I'm a big fan of the fresh veggie salad, it's on the appetizer menu and big enough for a meal!"
Jaime Z.,"Pleasanton, CA",0,18,7,1.0,6/20/2014,"I really don't understand the appeal of this place.  We never come because the wait is insanely long, but received a gift card.  Thursday at 8:45pm - 20 minute wait  - we decide to sit in the bar. App:  Had the crab cakes.  Terrible.  Completely mushy and served with a mayo sauce.  Sauce was bland. **Should have sent back Had a cheeseburger - ordered medium.  It was rare.   ***Should have sent back Ordered the Oreo Cookie Cheesecake.  It was good.   My husband and I spent $100.  That is crazy to me for how terrible the food was.   I have an insomnia and an insane headache now after the meal.   I should have given the gift card to someone else and gone Downtown Pleasanton for a decent meal."
Rpm R.,"San Ramon, CA",829,437,,4.0,4/15/2012,"We came for dinner (during happy hour) - ordered; A beer , a couple glasses of wine, a chicken marsala dish and an eggplant sandwich. Food good, service good, ambience = loud"
Vijetha P.,"Dublin, CA",1,44,4,4.0,7/20/2015,Really good food and customer service. But the wait time is too much even on Sunday 3pm.
Chris R.,"Pacifica, CA",171,766,2529,3.0,3/2/2012,"Flame grilled, charbroiled (char broiled).  Whatever you call it they apply flame to their burgers here.    Which is the best of course!  Flat top grilling just sucks IMO. Anyway, a decent job by The Cheesecake Factory.  Now that I know they make their meat this way I just might visit more often.  I will not haowevr, order by phone. They leave you on hold forever and may forget you.  Plus their music on hold quality just stinks."
Betty L.,"Castro Valley, CA",4,9,,3.0,2/6/2012,"I went to The Cheesecake Factory for lunch on a Saturday and was seated under 5 minutes for a table outside. It took awhile just to get some water and quite a long time to get our orders taken. The food was decent. Our server helped put some things umder the table legs to make it stop moving around which was nice because we didn't ask for it.  One thing I didn't like is how my friend asked for some more cheese on his pasta after being asked how's everything going, but the server forgot about it. But of course everyone forgets something once in awhile. At least it saved my friend some calories!  Each of our unfinished plates were helped placed in a to go box.  Only problem I have with this Cheesecake Factory is the long customer service but the food is nice."
Touché T.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,9,,1.0,7/19/2015,"I had the worst experience today! The food we ordered did not come out until 30 minutes after we placed our order. The worst part is they didn't even bring out the entire order. The last piece of our order came out 45 min which is when the manager, Matt Brown brought it out.  In his condescending tone, he said ""I will wait here until you take your first bite"".  No sincere apology, no willingness to compensate for the bad service. Even after I stated it ruined our experience he stated ""we will make sure the rest of your stay is a good one"" and walked away."
Janice C.,"San Francisco, CA",528,2174,5892,3.0,6/12/2009,"I was excited to see my friends because it has been months since our last meeting.   Dana and Clemence are my good friends from college and they know all my dirt.  The wait wasn't that bad on a weeknight (about 20 minutes) and service was so-so since she forgot to refill our waters.  My jambalaya over linguine was not spicy at all, and my pasta wasn't coated with enough sauce so it was bit dry.   My friend Dana ordered the pear and endive salad with chicken. Guess what? 5 minutes into eating her salad, she goes: "" um, do you see any pears in here?""  After digging through a mountain of chopped greens, we both said: ""Nope"".  Our server had to bring her grilled pears on the side.  Plus the chicken slices were so thin, you can barely even tell that they were there! My other gf Clemence had the grilled salmon with fries, and while her son Aiden, kept her hands full, Dana and I manage to steal some of her crispy thin-cut fries.  My favorite part at Cheesecake Factory is dessert time.  While our server clears out our table, we were talking about those ""remember when?"" stories.  Suddenly, Clemence reminded me of that one time in our Hematology class in college and said: ""yeah, you'd be in class all starry-eyed and say things like: Tom (who was my bf back then) and I would stare at each other for 15 minutes and not say anything but it still wasn't enough!""   I quickly downed my $11 cosmo while vehemently denying ""I did NOT say that!!!"" * both of them laughing their butts off confirmed that I did * When our Chocolate Raspberry truffle and Cheesecake with Fresh Strawberries came, I was not disappointed.  I could always count on dessert here to save my otherwise mediocre meal! Of course, friends like Dana and Clemence who take time out of their busy work schedule and family life to meet up for dinner are always winners in my book."
Ann B.,"TRINITY CTR, CA",38,52,,5.0,12/27/2013,"First off, the service was exceptional.  The restaurant was packed, so we assumed that we would have to wait a bit for our server to show up.  Not so.  Within minutes of being seated Nelson M. (very nice man) was taking our order.  He explained the specials and was quick to return with our drinks, and freshly baked bread.  Throughout our meal, which was very tasty, several different servers came by to make sure that everything was ok.  One standout was so very personable, I had to ask her name.  Jennifer Hyrup, thank you for making our dining experience a joy."
Angie R.,"San Francisco, CA",276,142,18,3.0,3/12/2012,My fiance and I decided to visit The Cheesecake Factory after a day of shopping at the Stoneridge Mall.  It was going to be a while before we were seated so we quickly found place at their bar. We ordered the Thai Lettuces Wraps and before we knew it we were seated.  Our waitress was great. She was very friendly and knew the menu well. We were in the mood for pasta so she recommended the Four Cheese Pasta and the Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta. We went with her recommendations and could not have been happier.   After our meal we ordered the Ultimate Red Velvet Cheesecake.  It was the perfect ending to our amazing meal. I can't wait to return to The Cheesecake Factory.
Czarina W.,"Fremont, CA",86,25,4,4.0,9/11/2011,"You MUST try the banana, peanut butter, and honey milkshake. MmMMm.... My favorites here are the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp and the Miso Salmon. They also have a dish called Caramel Chicken. Caramel on chicken?! That sounds awesome. haha! Next time. Very pleased with the service here :-)"
Sash P.,"Sacramento, CA",2,26,,1.0,8/18/2013,"I have never been to a restaurant that is so damn rude!!!! Called in for a togo order and when I picked it up my sister's order was wrong. Went back inside to tell them what was wrong with it. The waitress that took the order tried to argue saying it was what I ordered. How the hell you gonna argue about her order? Then another worker goes, ""Just tell someone to put some freaking basil oil on it."" Excuse me??? We should've cussed her ass out. Why the hell do you have rude ass workers working in such a nice restaurant?! Asked for a manager and when she came she did not apologize for her waitress actions at all. DISLIKE. Maybe you guys need to come down to Sacramento and have their Cheesecake Factory show you how to act with customers. Just saying."
Nate H.,"Sacramento, CA",35,42,17,2.0,4/19/2015,"I definitely did experience betetr, even with other Cheesecake factory branches. Waiting for at least 20 minutes to talk to the manager to be seated, while he is standing just next to us, to tell us that the wait is 2 hours.. I am fine if you are busy, but you just added 20 minutes to my wait time. Plate sizes are shrinking. We had a baby with high chair, we were seated in a place where the couple sitting next to us were locked in and can not leave their table because of our high chair.. It is indeed not our fault, but we felt wring about it, waiters and staff didn't seem to care. Want a refill?  sure, here is a filled to the tip cup that if you try to move it, you will spill on your self and the people sitting next to you.  I was not planning to change my cloth and take a shower after finishing dining, but I had to, I guess they support hygiene. One last thing, smiling doesn't hurt, you better try it, sometimes it is useful and can add few bucks to your tip. WIll not go there again."
Fred G.,"Castro Valley, CA",4,96,,2.0,5/18/2013,"Service was unattentive. The food took 40 minutes to arrive, and by the time my burger got to the table, it was way over cooked.  The cheesecake is good, but when I asked for my slice to be cut in half to share with a friend, she cut it WAY off center. The cheesecake also took 20 minutes to arrive. Won't be coming here again anytime soon."
Mona O.,"Pleasanton, CA",36,335,,2.0,7/6/2011,The food is not great! The cheesecake is not great! The other cakes are not that great! The prices are super inflated! The staff is not that friendly! The wait time is 45 minutes at least (just to get seated)! Please someone explain to me why!
Helen L.,"San Francisco, CA",50,834,305,3.0,2/22/2014,"Strategy:  Go straight to check in and get the pager, then go shopping.  The hostess was great.  She estimated 50 minutes wait and said to come back and check in.  We did our shopping and came back in 50 minutes, voila, a table ready for us!  How cool is that!  This is what I call efficiency.  The waitress was awesome, but she was busy.  Eventually she remembered to get what we needed.  The food:  not so awesome.  Yes, I got the 590 calorie enchilada which comes with marinaded vinegar pickled veggie.  I don't think anyone should order this.  Way too salty and way too vinegary.  The Caesar salad had some weird bitter taste.  The manager was awesome and willing to take that off our bill.  The fried food looked good, but that is the thing, it's fried!  Sitting near the bar was cool because we got to see the All Star game while eating.  The dessert, of course, was the final awesome part.  Had the key lime and tiramisu."
Charles W.,"Pleasanton, CA",0,13,1,1.0,11/12/2014,"Their seating & reservation policy is over-the-top for a chain restaurant. Tried to make a reservation for eight on a Wednesday night and was told they do not accept reservations after 5:30 because they are ""too busy""...attitude from a chain...Really!"
Shane S.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",20,10,5,4.0,6/3/2014,Great food at a reasonable price. Happy Hour from 4 to 6 on weekdays. Chicken Bellagio is great and so are the tex-mex eggrolls
Sarmad N.,"San Leandro, CA",468,288,145,3.0,9/3/2013,i am starting to think this place is over rated. the food was not bad but could have been better. it was so crowded and took 30 minutes just to be seated and an other 20 to just get bread and water.  our appetizer plates were not cleaned properly. we also sat outside and had to deal with there not being enough umbrellas to accommodate all the patrons.  this experience could have been way better.
