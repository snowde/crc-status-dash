Mary Lou H.,"Livermore, CA",0,1,,1.0,8/9/2015,"Arrived and had to wait not bad 15 mins.  were seated waited 20 mins to ask for water,  25 for coffee.  9 people and a 7 month old baby.  Watched others come in get waited on and eat.  finally our orders were taken 40 mins later.   now people that came in after us were leaving and more people were coming in and ordering.  Inquired where is our food?  It will be ready in a few mins.  finally after 1 hour or more wait .we decided to leave.  got up and had the courtesy to notify the waitress we were leaving.. All of a sudden we were told our food was ready.  SORRY  we will not be back to the place we have come to celebrate special occasions for years.  This waitress was rude.  spilled everything liquid she put on the table and had an attitude with every answer to our questions. Plus the silver ware was dirty. Not a good experience.  and,,,,NEVER AGAIN"
Charlie O.,"Waukon, IA",776,1198,210,5.0,5/25/2009,"Wow, don't believe this. Wrote a review on this store shortly after it opened up. Gave it 5 stars then and do so now.  The service here is either good or bad depending on what time of day you arrive. Today, it was good. Waited on immediately, ordered drinks, appetizer and main course all at once. Guess we were special, we had a waitress and a waiter for our spot at the Bar, lol. She had the lettuce wraps which upon seeing them wished I had done the same. Oh well. Me? Well I had the cuban sandwich. Had it once before and let me tell you it is divine, three different kinds of meat on it, perfecto.. You just gotta try it to really savor the three flavors melting together along with the swiss cheese."
DJ F.,"Union City, CA",54,162,256,4.0,11/28/2011,"Burgers, Fries and Sammys all Day... I don't eat cheesecake but I do get the Kids Ice Cream... I prefer to go here over lets say Ebar or any other competitors... Chicken Parmesan Sammy is the TRUTH..."
C R.,"Pittsburg, CA",0,99,,3.0,2/24/2013,Doesn't offer a lot that I like to eat but I do enjoy what I eat there. Of course the best part is having some cheesecake. Usually get the cheesecake to go as lunch/dinner fills me up. No rush in enjoying dessert...lol. The wait just like all Cheesecake Factory's can be long so get there before there is a rush.
Blondie R.,"East Troy, WI",204,320,36,5.0,4/22/2013,"I love this place!  The food and service are great.  Sometimes when I'm at Nordstrom, I call and order takeout.  By the time I walk over, my order is waiting.  I love the Famous Factory Meatloaf(meatloaf with grilled onions, mashed potatoes, gravy and corn succotash).  The food is a little pricy, but the portions are huge, and I can get  three servings from the meatloaf entree!!!   My daughter loves the Oreo Dream Extreme Cheesecake.  I don't get the cheesecake, but I love to look at all of them( they're beautiful!).  Hey, I need to keep my girlish figure!"
Sarah S.,"Castro Valley, CA",0,59,4,4.0,8/6/2012,"One time I came here for lunch and there was a long, thick, DISGUSTING strand of hair in my food. Obviously I complained and the manager was nice enough to give me another dish (which I refused because I was so grossed out) took the meal off the tab and gave my family free desserts. So they get stars for that even though it was an unfortunate experience. Their food is pretty good too and they have a lot of options. I love their vanilla bean cheesecake!"
Jing N.,"Pleasanton, CA",0,3,1,5.0,1/25/2015,"I gave this place a 5 star, not only just because of the food they serve, more impressively, the honesty and kindness of their staff members.  I lost my wallet there several days ago and when I went to Cheesecake Factory today, I can't believe they still kept it safe for me.  I can't say enough thank you and wanted to leave them all the cash in my retrieved wallet. But they say that is their job and they are happy for me and refuse to take anything.  What a great team!"
Ravonnie W.,"Fremont, CA",0,4,1,4.0,7/30/2014,"My family and I came to celebrate my cousins birthday recently. Before I start the complaints and compliments I'd like to state that this is the best Cheesecake Factory I've been to in the Bay Area; the SF one is WAYYY to cramped and the Palo Alto one is always to slow. We sat outside for the first time, which was probably a bad idea considering we all wore shorts on a windy day. But I was more concerned out food would get cold, which it didn't. We tried the Chicken Samoas, and they were alright the filling was good but the dough was just a wonton wrapper, true samoa eaters know that's a no-no! Lol...This visit wasn't all that great because we took our cakes to go and got all the way home to find we were missing one! I'll still go back but I'll THROUGHLY check my bag before I leave."
Megan S.,"Dublin, CA",10,1,,3.0,7/29/2014,Best place to eat is at the bar. Anywhere else like a table or to go order takes a really long time. Bartenders are all great!
Wish U knew H.,"Hayward, CA",16,35,3,1.0,2/27/2014,"Very bad service, I'm very adamant on service! So sad that the food here is good, and to have a crappy waitress names Gabriela . Who would ask if we needed something, after 15 min and then if we say yes, she goes and walks around like she's hungover and twiddles her fingers and never gives us what we asked for because she forgot? Lol um do you think we don't watch? We can see you walk away and just stand there, on purpose!"
Sam A.,"Benicia, CA",232,694,304,3.0,3/21/2012,"Its cheesecake factory - same as the others good food, high calories, decent meal.  Nothing really shocking to report"
Veronica T.,"Union City, CA",0,5,,5.0,5/16/2015,I had the bacon cheeseburger and it was delicious. And the cheesecake was amazing. Our waitress Beth was an absolute sweetheart and very attentive. I will definitely come back and hopefully she will be there!
Adrian W.,"San Francisco, CA",11,114,46,2.0,2/25/2014,This was a lot of waiting. We're talking over an hour before we got our food. We were completely ignored. The food quality was so so...
Miroslaba V.,"Oakland, CA",143,5,,1.0,6/19/2015,"I waited 40 minutes for a salad to come out. And the excuse was they were busy...didn't look like it to me despite I ordered it at their to-go section of the restaurant. Poor service. Yes, Willis did offer me a drink, but I had already asked for a water 10 minutes before as I waited."
J C.,"Stockton, CA",0,4,1,2.0,8/11/2013,Took forever to get our food everyone who where seated after us had already been served and almost finish before we got our food... My hibachi steak came out cold which told me they forgot about our dinner.... waiter apologized and offered to reheat a medium rare steak really??? Won't be coming to this location again had much better service at others...
Bryce T.,"San Francisco, CA",1,11,,1.0,6/15/2015,"Overpriced, overcrowded, and understaffed, while the food is good, this place simply doesn't deserve your time and money.  Look elsewhere."
Arti S.,"Manteca, CA",0,37,,5.0,7/23/2014,Been to this place twice! Absolutely incredible and delicious! Food is always wonderful and service is always very friendly! The only Cheesecake Factory restaurant I've been to in my life and I love it!
Daphne A.,"Lathrop, CA",62,7,2,4.0,7/7/2011,"Been here a couple of times and celebrated Valentine's Day with my boyfriend, wait was over an hour! But we already expected it. Also for a late Father's Day. My family and I arrived an hour before closing time yet they still seated us which was kind of them considering the 45+ minute drive to get there. Good service, great food and beautiful interior! Would come again."
Maria R.,"Hayward, CA",85,57,51,5.0,3/28/2012,"5 stars for cheesecake. One of my favorite eateries in town for dessert. Who can say no to layered Red Velvet Cheesecake? Some slices can be huge but Every bite is magically delicious! It's defiantly a must try and they have a wonderful cheesecake menu to try other flavors too. 4 stars: The food is a little over priced but serves in large quantities. Gets super loud sometimes and is always busy. I think it's due to having it right next to the mall, staff is friendly and attentive. And remember you can't leave a cheesecake factory restaurant without trying a cheesecake so make sure to leave room in your belly!"
Ruobin W.,"Stony Brook, NY",227,787,128,3.0,9/24/2011,"To be fair, if I were only going to base this review upon Cheesecake Factory's happy hour menu, it would probably be a 4.5. They have a long appetizer menu and each item is delicious (granted most of them are fried or baked). Our party consisted of 4 people sharing 5 appetizers: the Buffalo Blasts, Wild Mushroom Pizzette, Chicken Samosas, Warm Crab and Artichoke Dip and Avocado Eggrolls. Everyone enjoyed the Buffalo Blasts' crispy chicken even though the dipping sauces weren't exactly amazing. The Avocado Eggrolls were a little sweet but tasted amazing nonetheless. I would have to say that the Wild Mushroom Pizzette and the Crab and Artichoke Dip were the best-tasting of the set. Each of them was flavorful and left us satisfied. The only item we were disappointed about were the Chicken Samosas. They did not live up to our expectations and unfortunately there weren't many of them to begin with.  At about $5 per appetizer, it was a pretty damn good deal for all the food we ate. Two in our party ordered the happy hour drinks as well. The JW Pink Lemonade, the Mojito and the Long Island Iced Tea were delicious, sweet and fairly reasonably priced at $5. Not that many drinks on the menu, though, but still good.  The cheesecake is nothing short of spectacular. Each piece is $7-8 dollars so it's only a once in a while kind of luxury for me. Of all the cheesecakes I've had, I really enjoyed the Red Velvet, the Tiramisu, the White Raspberry Chocolate and the Turtle. The Red Velvet really is the Ultimate Red Velvet though.  As I said, if it were only the happy hour menu I was reviewing, Cheesecake Factory would get a 4.5. However, their regular-priced food isn't very good, in comparison, and is really expensive at $10-15 per item.  The service is really excellent and the atmosphere is nice. I would still go again and again for the happy hour menu."
