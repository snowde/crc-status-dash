Steve N.,"Brentwood, CA",199,453,403,3.0,6/16/2013,"The most important part is lemon raspberry cheesecake for dessert! 5 star. Other than that, it's ok. 3 star is A-OK, so there ya go."
Viviana R.,"San Leandro, CA",57,16,3,5.0,4/10/2014,"The food is amazingly yummy, but kind of pricy....  The cheesecakes are super yummy as well!!!... Can't wait to come back on my father's birthday..."
Jackie S.,"Milpitas, CA",416,1463,2091,3.0,7/27/2009,I always like to eat at the Cheesecake Factory. The food is decent for a chain restaurant.  We ended up eating outside in the summer heat since there was a long wait for seating inside. The umbrellas affixed to the gates didn't provide any shade to our table.  The food was okay. My fiance had the lunch portion of the spicy chicken pasta. There wasn't any heat in the pasta dish. My sister got the white pizza that had two different cheeses and spinach. The pizza wasn't too bad. I had the lunch portion of the santa fe salad. The salad wasn't that great. The mozzarella cheese overpowered the flavor of the salad and made it too oily. I liked dessert! We shared the white chocolate chunk cheesecake with macadamia nuts. Mmmmm.. You literally had three chunks of macadamia nuts in every bite. Yum!  The service was good. Our waitress accommodated our table when we requested more of the rye bread. Our lunch came out close to $50. I think it is a bit pricey for lunch.
Miss L.,"Dublin, CA",491,121,2182,3.0,4/20/2012,"I went there with family for my birthday. Our buzzer rang and gave it to the hostess...apparently we waited for 20 minutes after..  I knew something was up. They gave our table to the wrong person. The funny part was it was under my mom's name and they gave it to group of guys.... hm..... at least I know what the requirements are for applying for a job at Cheesecake.  Our servers were nice.  Somehow  we ended up having 2-3 servers for our table. Hm....I think they got lost or confused.  The food was good as usual.  When they came to bring my red velvet Chesse cake and sang an off tuned Happy Birthday song, one of my servers, almost dropped my slice on the floor, and started laughing. What were they smoking???   Then I ended up with a tummy flu. Well, Happy Birthday to me! :D"
Lola B.,"Sunol, CA",4,72,19,5.0,7/17/2014,Just had the best experience with a really sweet server named Tina. I have never been taken care of so well at a restaurant. She just had such a sweet and kind attitude . Our food was great!!!! Can't wait to come back and ask to sit in her station . Thank you Tina for making our visit to the cheese cake factory so enjoyAble
Joe W.,"San Leandro, CA",64,36,30,5.0,4/5/2014,"We came without reservation, wait time was moderate about 40 mins bit once seated our server christine c took care of us very well. She checked up on us just enough without bugging us, she got our order correct and our food was hot n fresh. I dont think ive had better customer service like this in a long time. The garlic noodles we order definitely needs more garlic, but besides that thank you christine!"
Sylvia P.,"Concord, CA",0,10,,5.0,7/12/2015,"Today was the first day I sat outside and what a beautiful day it was. We had Alfredo as our waiter and he was attentive, had a great personality and even though the bar ran out of Sangria, we had a blast!! When Alfredo went on a break, a nice red-headed lady attended our table. Great food and service today. Thanks!!"
Pris S.,"Los Angeles, CA",17,83,16,5.0,7/2/2011,"I see that in many of these reviews, people complain about the long wait. Sometimes I look at wait times as a personal compliment to the restaurant. On a regular thursday recently we walked in and had a 45 minute wait, but if you are acquainted with how the restaurant works, you would already expect the wait, so obviously, go there earlier than you anticipate your hunger to hit. For me and my friends, every time we go, we anticipate the wait and afterwards, it's worth it when the food comes.  My personal favorite is the factory combinations. I love the shrimp scampi and steak diane. I also love the herb-crusted salmon.  their cheesecake and other desserts are absolutely fantastic and what they're famous for, so come for it! The waitresses and waiters are always extremely polite to me, I imagine they can have their on and off days and preferred and non-preferred customers, waiters aren't bias-free, but all in all, as a customer, my personal opinion is that i've had an enjoyable experience every time and i always look forward to eating at Cheesecake when my friends suggest stoneridge mall to shop!"
Jeff T.,"San Francisco, CA",0,3,,2.0,5/28/2015,"I've come to this location several times and I am constantly amazed at how bad the food and service is. They've overlooked my grilled salmon on 3 separate occasions.  So on this visit I ordered the filet. Well different dish, same result. Ordered it medium and it came back well. Waited a total of 45 minutes to eat dinner, and to top it off.   They wanted me to pay for this experience."
Tam F.,"San Ramon, CA",489,1397,253,4.0,2/28/2009,"I am as surprised as you all that I came here as well as giving it a 4 star review. I met my girlfriend for lunch and we were told it would be about a half hour wait. This was okay because she had a return to make at Macy's so we just reversed the order we were going to do things. We told them we would take the first available table and were given a pager. Off to Macy's we went. Macy's took longer than expected, so when we were leaving, our pager went off. Perfect timing. We were seated at a table outside. Our server greeted us right away and asked if we wanted bread which we gratefully declined. Had it been brought to us, we would have eaten it. The menu is huge and diverse. My friend had a lunch salad and I had a lunch pizza/salad combo. The pizza was divine (roasted veggies and feta) and my side salad was huge. We were pleased with the price, the food and the service. I doubt I would wait in line for more than 1/2 hour for any restaurant, but this one was a great one for lunch."
Hoa H.,"Castro Valley, CA",1,11,,2.0,11/2/2013,"We came for dinner after 6pm Thursday and were seated right away.  However the tables are too close to each other for comfort.  You practically would not want to discuss anything private since the people next to your table can hear you loud and clear even if you whisper.  The noise from the crowd plus the background music make conversation impossible.  So we just shut up and order.  It was really uncomfortable to enjoy dinner there.  Luckily the food was not bad, maybe we were just lucky ordering the right dishes.  After the meal, the waiter played hide-and-seek game where we had to look for him to get the check and box the leftover.   This was not a good experience for me.  I doubt I'll come back any time soon."
Mike P.,"Pleasanton, CA",5,7,,1.0,3/25/2015,"When people who sit down after you get your food wayyyy before you do (and i only ordered a meal to split with the wife) you get kind of upset. Also when i have to ask for another glass of water when you come to my table 3 times to tell me my food is coming that is a food server fail. Johnie was on point with her other tables not mine. Guess what, no tip. You see an empty glass you ask if they want another. Extremely disappointed. Used to love coming here. Peace out cheese cake. Pleasanton and Dublin got way more better options then this."
Diana B.,"San Ramon, CA",112,345,431,4.0,4/10/2011,"The Cheesecake Factory is where I go to just enjoy good food and good company. They have great food, great service, a great ambiance and yummy desserts. My Perfect Menu: Appetizers: Fire- roasted Artichoke w/balsamic vinegar  Salads: Grilled Chicken Tostada Salad w/ cilantro dressing on the side Dessert: The tuxedo cheesecake 2nd Best: Appetizers: Avocado Rolls Entree: chicken stuffed tortillas Dessert: banana cheesecake All plates can be shared- trust me!"
Robert A.,"Dublin, CA",41,22,5,1.0,9/23/2013,"I used to think that this place was just okay. You know what to expect: A large menu full of food that is okay, with middle of the road service, and fabulous cheesecake (avoid the terrible breakfast/brunch). If I return, it will be for a slice to go. The service here has degraded to a point that I think that if there is management at this location, they are either negligent or purposely trying to sabotage the company. In any case, I will not be dining here again. Even mediocre service could have saved my opinion of this place, but that won't be my problem any more."
Toni B.,"Manteca, CA",0,1,,1.0,6/30/2015,"Went here on 06/28/15 Sunday, for an early dinner around 4 pm. We received the worst service you can't imagine. I probably could write pages.  This is one of my most favorite restaurants, and I was really looking forward to eating here today. But it left me hating the place.  We sat outside for a start which was pretty quick, had we known the tables were broken and wobbly we would not have sat there. The manager tried to level the table with folded napkins. From the get go, the waitress was not personable at all. She wore her dark black sunglasses while taking our order and was not wanting to be there. I wish I took pictures to show you all the unprofessional ism. It took over 40 minutes for our food. Bread was cold and finally brought more but right before our dinner plates... Really!  I was so excited to eat my usual spicy chipotle pasta...the pasta was so hard undercooked.  I let her know politely but waitress and manager could careless. I was shocked!  The waitress would bring drinks with soda spilling everywhere.  Had to be there moment.  She never brought my extra sauce for pasta to make it a bit softer. My husband ordered a beer and it came almost towards end of dinner. People please don't waste your time and money here. The one in Fresno is soooo much better! We tried talking to the main manager but they al were avoiding to talk to come to us. Even table next to us was complaining about the food. This was bad experience.  This place in Pleasanton should be called Cheap-Cake factory!!!"
Hisham A.,"Santa Clara, CA",4,23,,1.0,10/11/2013,"Came to curb side. Parked.... Called... Was put on hold, Waited... Waited... Waited... 30 mins pass. Went to PF Changs. Mind you I called twice. So who knows I how long I actually waited. Terrible."
Angelica N.,"Fremont, CA",20,2,,3.0,6/22/2015,"3 of us had gone Friday night and seated quickly and everything went well. Both my mom and I enjoyed our meals. 3/4 of the way through my mom's boyfriends meal(salmon, which seemed not to be cooked all the way) he began to feel pretty sick and went to the restroom. During that time my mom told our waitress that she believed the food may not have been cooked all the way. The manager had came to talk to us about the incident and he made us feel like we were lying. I understand people do it all the time, but we didn't ask for a free meal, we didn't say he got food poisoning, we didn't ask for Anyyything. All he kept saying was ""wow food poisoning doesn't kick in until 4 hours later"". He literally said it like 6 times in a 5 minute conversation. He was pretty rude and disrespectful, he shouldn't be in a position of management if guests concerns don't come first. We paid the meal in full still. Thanks for the good meal, but no thanks to the immature behavior from a grown man that is suppose to be a manager."
Steve G.,"Oakland, CA",0,8,,2.0,6/20/2014,"Be prepared to be RIPPED OFF by the high prices of their drinks.  Their Peach Margarita, prepared in a Martini glass (which means minimal drink) ......costs $11.50 each. This drink should have cost $4.50.......Additionally, their Beer costs $8.50 each. This drink should have cost $4.  Their marginal wines range in prices from $30 to $40, and all of their red wines are 2012 or 2013....which is much to young.  Their food was OK.....nothing to rave about."
Rob D.,"Danville, CA",0,17,,1.0,3/12/2011,"Beware the undisclosed prices here.  Transparency and honesty aren't on the menu. They promote their specialty drinks heavily in the menus but disclose no price.  I didn't ask, but would bet they are somewhere between $12 and $15, but who would know.  The restaurant did disclose the wine prices, so I stuck with wine. The hidden drink prices should have been a tip-off that this place is not into full disclosure. My wife does not eat red meat.  She ordered the cobb salad at $12.95 but asked to remove the bacon and the chicken, but substitute salmon for the two.  The waitress said there would be a minimal up charge.  Well OK. When the check arrived, the up charge (even after two meats were removed was $6.  Hardly minimal since the up charge approached 50 percent of  the cost of the original salad even before removing the two meats. The restaurant stood its ground on the pricing both with the waitress and the the manager.  The manager finally and begrudgingly dropped $5 of the upcharge.  What an embarrasing way for the customer to force a restaurant to not gouge the paying customers. Beware."
Gene Albert E.,"Dublin, CA",263,13,24,3.0,2/17/2014,"I've been here three times (once a year) and I thought it would get better, but it's still the same. Let's talk about the service first. Do NOT have a birthday dinner here. If you do, be there three hours earlier. Why three hours? They don't take reservations. Also, the woman on the phone said we'd only have to wait 30 minutes at a certain time... #trustbroken. The good thing about this place is that the manager is really nice (the African American man) and he really does mean it when he says, ""I'll try to do something about it."" The waiters are really nice too: friendly, energetic, and happy. The food however... let's just say the pasta is hard and should be cooked more, and my mom makes better rice, but maybe that's because she's Filipino... but still. They messed up on my order when I got the Teriyaki Chicken, but I didn't want to complain because I'm a waiter too and I hate it when the order gets messed up because we feel like it's our fault even though it isn't. The cheesecakes are really good, though. The only thing is that they're too sweet, but the presentation is excellent! They should just stick to cheesecakes in my opinion.  My final tip? Don't be fooled by how fancy the place looks because the food isn't that good. BJ's has better food in my opinion (if you're torn between the two.) Cheesecake is the bomb though."
