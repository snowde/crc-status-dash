Ken T.,"Berkeley, CA",111,63,384,4.0,2/15/2014,"On Saturday afternoon, I came with a friend to the Stoneridge mall to do some shopping. At 2 PM, we decided to get lunch at the Cheesecake Factory hoping that the wait wouldn't be too long then. However, they told us that the wait was for 40 min. Well, we were slightly bummed but it wasn't too bad. They gave us the little electronic device and we just went back and shopped some more. We came back after 40 minutes or so and the device started flashing! It was very nice that 40 min actually meant 40 min.  We were seated promptly and the waitress came quickly and offered us bread and drinks. We ordered the peach smoothie, which was pretty good! It had a really fresh flavor but was on the sweet side. I ordered the spicy crispy chicken sandwich with fries. It also came with a chipotle mayo sauce (or buffalo if you prefer that) which I thought was nice. The chicken certainly was very crispy. It looked like it had been fried for a bit too long though but still tasted really good. The spice was great. It was definitely there but not too spicy at all. It came with a nice piece of melted cheese on the top and lettuce and a tomato on the side. The lettuce was shredded, which is kind of weird to me to leave on the side...since it was pretty hard to get on the sandwich since it just kept falling out. In addition, the lettuce wasn't very fresh and tasted kind of bitter (and without the nice crisp of fresh lettuce). Other than that, the sandwich was pretty good. The fries were pretty standard. My friend ordered the Bistro Shrimp Pasta and thought it was pretty decent. The pasta and the sauce tasted nice but the sauce was a bit greasy. The shrimp was cooked well and tasted fresh. The serving portions of both dishes were both fairly large and along with the bread, we left very full (without room for dessert unfortunately). The good thing was that it was easy to walk by and get a piece of cheesecake to go! Overall, I would say it was a decent experience. The food is pretty good and the service was nice. The waitress was very energetic and checked up on us frequently to make sure that we were okay. I wish the food was more, well healthier, but I guess that's what you get for going to the Cheesecake Factory!"
Dale R.,"Tracy, CA",13,13,4,5.0,5/5/2012,"OMG!!!   I am notorious for receiving horrible service... It must have been the full moon, but we had AWESOME service at The Cheesecake Factory tonight. Our drinks were never below half full and the server (Mike) was spot on with his attitude. ... The food was outstanding as well."
Hannah N.,"Concord, CA",1,12,4,2.0,6/15/2015,"Came here for lunch and our waiter seemed distracted and unable to fill a drink order for my friend. He asked my friend to look up what was in the drink so he could ""tell the bar"". Took 20 minutes to get our bill. Not impressed with the lunch hour service."
Elisa C.,"Pleasanton, CA",344,307,83,4.0,3/7/2011,"The wait gets pretty ridiculous for very mediocre American food. The servers are generally pretty nice and attentive  (well, you gotta work for your tips right?).  My favorite dish here of all time has to be the chicken madeira. I seldom order anything else. They also have really good mango mojitos. I know its not on the menu, but I've had it on many occasions. Sometimes you'll get a snooty bartender who insists that they don't make those. Right. I've only had it at least.. 5 times."
Jonathan D.,"Oakland, CA",133,136,11,3.0,2/12/2014,"My only reason to agree to go shopping as she wants. Eating here. Now if we can't come to an agreement that we will eat here, well then, cup of noodles it is and I'm staying home."
Jim D.,"Oakland, CA",584,702,412,4.0,3/11/2009,"I 've been to three Cheesers in the Bay Area ....SF, Pali Alto & Westfields in San Ho.  All three are similar but not the same.I don't know if it is the city is located in or what. But hey lets add one more to the list. On the westside of Stoneridge Mall, the restaurant is situated right across from PF something.There is outside seating with heaters and a big bar. The only bad thing is the lighting, it is so dim you must bring a flashlight with you. I was suggested from Anne T. to order the bacon wrapped dates, unfortunatley I was late and did not the appetizers.  1. Calamari  light and not greasy, cocktail and tartar sauce. 2. Won ton  deep fried with seafood in the inside. Very yummy My main course was the medallions of chicken which was moist, no chicken jerky for me. It had a hoison flavor taste with tumeric and curry (very tasty). String beans and asparagus that were lightly sauteed.  I thought the service was really good and the food was above average. Bring your credit card because it is kinda pricey for a chain restaurant."
Joe S.,"San Ramon, CA",150,44,5,3.0,8/3/2011,"First of all, I want to say that the Cheesecake Factory is my favorite restaurant, but I was so disappointed at my last visit here in Pleasanton.  Our waitress took forever for simple requests. Since when did we have to ask several times to get our first serving of bread? After we got our bread, we didn't see our waitress for 40 minutes... we discovered she went on break and the person who was relieving her did not tell us. He just swung by and asked us if everthing was okay ONE TIME. What topped everything off is the fact that the tables are so close together that it gets really awkward. I'm referreing to when the gentlemen next to us stood up, tried to squeeze by, stuck his large behind in my face, and gave it a quick scratch and sniff.  I was holding my hand over my water the whole time so I wouldn't get any farticles in it.  Please, PLEASE, get a booth when you come here. Again, this is my favorite restaurant, I just wouldn't come to the one in Pleasanton ever, ever again unless my craving for Miso Salmon becomes so disabling that I can't drive a bit farther to the San Jose one."
Doctor G.,"Alameda County, CA",0,1740,1,3.0,4/23/2012,"Large restaurant to accommodate the hordes of shoppers from Stoneridge Mall.  Outside dining as well.  Excellent service.  The prawns and angel hair pasta was excellent, although the menu didn't mention the cream-based sauce.  The romaine lettuce cups appetizer was good, but the salmon fried wrap was a bit greasy.   Prices are just OK."
Joel F.,"Livermore, CA",9,91,,4.0,10/17/2013,"OK, it's a theme chain restaurant.  Everything I've had here has been pretty good.  I don't generally order dessert so I can't say much about the eponymous product.  The dessert ordering family member says that  ""factory"" is false modesty.  I've had a variety of entrees and salads.  Huge portions, monstrous portions, monumental portions.  I've never ordered anything exotic.  Let's face it, you should only order exotic stuff in an ethnic or gourmet place or one of the weird in a good way places in ""Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives"" that are never in the area where you live.  In places like this you should stick with American Comfort Food.  They do a good job on that."
Sheryl G.,"Hayward, CA",55,40,88,4.0,2/3/2014,"We came here on supposedly busy hour around 630pm, surprisingly we were seated within 5 minutes of waiting. Tiffany our server was great. Fast service and you don't even have to call for assistance. She filed our bread and sodas right away. Food was delicious.just love the place!"
Jenny C.,"San Francisco, CA",16,40,,2.0,4/7/2011,"Honestly, not really impressed by this location. It was a Wednesday night (~6pm) and I came here with one of my good friends for a catch up dinner. It took 45 minutes to get a table! I don't really know about you, but I find that pretty ridiculous for a Wednesday night and there were several empty tables that we passed by. The food wasn't anything to write home about and they really skimp on the avocado they put into salads. My friend was able to get more by complaining to the waitress, but it was only 3 puny slices more.  The waitress pretty much kicked us out of our table at the end of our dinner by ""asking"" for the check back and then later asking for our salt and pepper shakers?? Eh. The only thing I'd come back here for is the cheesecake to go. Red Velvet keeps me coming back for more."
Benetta H.,"Porter Ranch, CA",197,15,1,4.0,7/17/2011,"Oh cheesecake factory, I give you insane props on serving colossal food portions; as a result, i can never get to masticate on cheesecake...-_-"" In general, there is a gargantuan variety of appetizers, entrees, cheesecakes, drinks, and seafood to chooose from. I have ordered most of the things on the menu and most of them are quite delectable.  i ordered the thai chicken pasta. The sauce amalgamation was rather ambrosial. Peanutty and creamy, rich in flavor and just right in the spices. The chicken on the other hand, seemed like someone had exsiccated the flavor and juices from the meat.  I ate 45% of my entree just to ensure i had enough space in my stomach to hold another 15% of fresh strawberry cheesecake. I like the plain taste of cheesecake--not tooo rich, not too sweet, just perfect. simple pleasures and on the dot of perfection :]  After reading these reviews about the long wait lines, i agree with some people that long wait lines indicate a popular, and possibly infamous restaraunt. I like the waits just so you and your pals have time to catch up and talk outside, or walk around the mall, if there is one. Tonight, my family and another friend's family went to eat here, and there was a 30-40minute wait, but we were preoccupied with looking at clothes, chit-chatting, that the time flew by.  Their bread is cooked fresh and served hot out of the oven. I ate so much of the black/wheat/multigrain bread. Lots of fiber!!!"
Heather P.,"Oakland, CA",38,34,150,5.0,12/21/2011,"It never fail, this place is the bomb.. every time I go their I'm pleased. The service is great the people are nice and I ENJOY it often."
Julie H.,"Pleasanton, CA",10,27,,2.0,7/27/2013,I've used Cheesecake Factory many times for lunch take-out per clients request and have never had an order ready on time.  It's painfully slow service & I would never use them if given the choice.
Freya G.,"San Leandro, CA",7,27,24,4.0,2/17/2014,"I came with a friend to Stoneridge mall on Sunday lunch time and there is no wait for CF! This is actually the second time I've been to CF. Last time I had a red velvet cheesecake and it was so sweet. So I do crave for another flavor this time! They have Sunday brunch and of which Giant Belgian Waffle sounds very attractive but I insist  So we had a Mango Key Lime Cheesecake. It was a good choice, the cheese is a bit sweet and the mango and lime are perfect to even it out. Maybe a bit less tart will be better, but it's much better than the red velvet. We also had Chicken Bellagio and a small plate of Warm Asparagus Salad. Both of them are very impressive. The Chicken patty is tender and delicious and the size is huge! Good for share!"
Jess G.,"Fremont, CA",53,20,3,5.0,3/15/2014,"I love this place, the service is superb and their cheesecakes are to die for! I would come here more often but it's a bit far for me."
Gabi M.,"Dublin, CA",36,261,51,3.0,2/8/2012,"so it's a national chain, I don't expect a lot; I would not order grilled fish here or expect real ethnic food. But they have a huge selection with something for everyone & if you like cheesecake, HEllo! Things I ate I liked: *chicken samosas - of course they are not the real-deal, but very good with minced chicken & herbs in phyllo triangles with creamy-herb sauce, yum! *fried calamari - light & yum *spicy chicken chipotle pasta - good stuff *Lemon cello cake - so yum! light, lemony, whipped cream & strawberries, what's not to like?!? So-so dishes: *tempura shrimp stuffed pepper - was a bit mushy in spots, a bit greasy, good sweet sauce *fish n chips - just average, they could get more creative, at least with a sauce? *jamaican pepper shrimp - was not near spicy, not much flavor, plantains was the best part Might try brunch there, and the fish tacos looked good going by... I think this place is best for apps & drinks & dessert. I will say, the staff at this location is very good, all were very nice & attentive, worked like a team, A+ for them! Oh, but the bathroom needs more attention..."
Rosie M.,"San Francisco, CA",143,309,200,2.0,6/11/2013,"We received our appetizer before we received our silverware and appetizer plates. By the time we finished, there was no need for plates. Then our entrees arrived without silverware. Our waitress had a really difficult time coming out to help us. I would rate this the worst Cheesecake Factory in the Bay Area."
Cindy C.,"Oakland, CA",68,201,450,2.0,3/13/2011,"I hate this location. Came here for my birthday with my boyfriend and the wait was 3 hours. The next time..I  came here with my sister and cousin...the wait was 3 hours. I came here just for 2 slice of red velvet cheese cake TO GO...and the wait was 50 minutes. damn, how hard is it to slice the damn cheese cakes? !@#$%^&*(! Ugh....i am not coming here no more. The food sucks. The only thing thats good here is the cheese cakes only! Service sucks too!"
Todd G.,"Brentwood, CA",0,6,,1.0,5/23/2015,"Had to wait over an hour to get seated and served. Sandwich was listed as grilled but was a greasy, soggy mess! Disgusting!!! I will not be back."
