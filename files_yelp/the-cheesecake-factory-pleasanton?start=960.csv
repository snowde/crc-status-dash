Juli C.,"Hayward, CA",0,56,25,1.0,2/9/2015,Poor service at 3pm on a Monday. Really? Not even busy.  The server didn't know the menu. I was very disappointed. Off to PF Changs next time!
Kathryn D.,"San Ramon, CA",13,13,,5.0,5/19/2015,"The Saturday night before Mother's Day we went to the Cheesecake Factory for dinner.  It was busy, busy, busy but after about an hour we were lucky to get a table in the bar area.  The electricity went; however, during that time there was no issue with anyone getting narley except two guys watching sports on the TV.  Customers were helping customers, Greg, the manager, and his staff were phenomenal during this process by using the lights on their phones to help each other.  Great job, Cheesecake Factory."
John M.,"Vacaville, CA",8,65,12,3.0,2/9/2014,"I've been to this Cheescake Factory a few times and it has satisfied me each time. The food menu is expansive and can easily overwhelm you with the choices. The staff had decent knowledge of the dishes and were overall helpful when deciding. The decor of the place is pretty amazing, not what I had imagined. Very fancy decor a nice place to take a date. The Cheesecake selections is the largest in on place that I've seen and all are pretty good. It would be too hard to go to into a cheesecake induced coma!"
Matt W.,"West Jordan, UT",0,11,,4.0,8/1/2013,"I came here on business, and have to agree with other reviewers, this place is tiny. I sat outside on the patio so I didn't have to wait. That was a mistake. It was a little windy and they didn't had enough patio umbrellas to shade every table. I left with a headache from squinting into the setting sun. My server, Stefanie, was great and the service was surprisingly quick for how busy they seemed. She made sure to let me know it was National Cheesecake Day so all their cheesecakes were half off. How do you say no to that? You don't come to the Cheesecake Factory because their meals are all that great, you come for the cheesecake."
V J.,"Pleasanton, CA",0,9,,4.0,5/14/2014,Luv this place! Luv the food.  Luv the cocktails.  Service is not too bad either.  But I take off one star for the waiting time to get to a table
C S.,"Pleasanton, CA",0,73,,2.0,10/10/2014,"I normally tip generously but today I did not, due to very poor service.  I felt invisible while many waiters passed me by to serve nearby tables.  Unacceptable."
L. C.,"San Francisco, CA",8,205,13,4.0,2/24/2012,"Cheesecake is yummy. Fried calamari is yummy. Avocado Egg Rolls not so yummy. Big portions, so share, share, share!"
Erika G.,"Livermore, CA",368,754,449,3.0,3/14/2009,"Surprise lunch with hubby this past Friday while I was working in the mall.  He was a little jealous of all my ""working lunches"" here.  Nice beautiful weather for sitting outside and the waiter was attentive. Food was alright, the usual BBQ Chicken Ranch Salad lunch size.  Still a large portion.  Pretty tasty.  Hubby got the Philly sandwich he said it was good, with a lot of beef and not filled with mostly veggies.   I ordered a slice of White Chocolate Macadamia Nut Cheesecake to eat later.  It sucked!  Way too many macadamia nuts and hardly any cheesecake.  I would definitely not order it again! But otherwise the nice lunch with my hubby was good."
Julie L.,"Sacramento, CA",493,259,140,2.0,12/6/2010,"This is for the Sunday brunch exclusively.  * shout out to Lauren, hey hun! thx for going with me :) We arrived around 1130 AM. Already at standing room only capacity. The aromas in the air smelled inviting but the 45 min wait time was disappointing.  After waiting the full time. . . We're finally seated & I can feel my mouth start to water from the anticipation of what the brunch menu would include.  Talk about disappointment - round 2 - when the brunch menu is one small page! The regular menu goes on for days...and only 1 page!? I had the ""lemon-ricotta pancakes""  they tasted sourdough-ish and the ricotta was tasteless and only provided thickness to the layers inside the pancakes.  Lauren had the waffle combo. Which came with.... no, JUST the waffle. No sides. no meat. no toast. NO whip cream.  NEGs- - For $9-10 pancakes/waffles they didn't offer any included side items. - Portion sizes were decent at best. - Flavoring of the food itself wasn't that great. - #1 complaint:  Before anything else server asks me: ""Would you like to order bread with this?""  Sure! I thought. A minute later... complimentary bread comes out. Both the paid bread & complimentary - same thing. Only difference was that one was toasted! Are you kidding me. I've had better for brunch."
Danny N.,"Monterey, CA",7,62,4,4.0,5/26/2013,"The food was great & the customer service was good. Management needs to learn how to seat customers faster, to minimize long waits."
Sharee g.,"San Leandro, CA",245,491,499,4.0,1/4/2011,"Things that I've eaten and can vouch for: avocado eggrolls!!! *licks lips* YUM!!!! (a must everytime I go) thai lettuce wraps shrimp scampi thai noodle salad french country salad bbq chicken pizza miso salmon red velvet cheesecake godiva chocolate cheesecake The drinks are pretty good too. Food for thought don't go when you're SUPER starved there's always a wait, even for the bar area. Luckily for me and my mom, we only had a 15min wait. No reservations."
Paulina G.,"San Leandro, CA",0,4,,1.0,9/10/2016,"ok so im vegan, i came here to celebrate my moms birthday and it took a while to be seated but that's to be expected on a weekend, the waitress was nice, my only issue was with the food which for a restaurant its obviously a big part of the review, so i ordered the vegetarian burger, no cheese, no mayo with fries when my order came is had mayonnaise so i had to send it back and then when i got my burger the server said my fries were getting made but it took them 5 minutes to give me the fries and when they finally brought me the fries they were cold! then i realized oh! they didn't put tomatoes on my burger which were originally suppose to be on it, so i asked the waitress to bring me tomatoes slices and it took her another 5 minutes! to bring me sliced tomatoes 5 minutes!!! and to top it all off the burger was disgusting worst vegan burger i've ever tasted, it was completely flavorless. honestly im just never going to visit another cheesecake factory again not just this specific location, ive been turned of enough to never visit another cheesecake factory again."
A P.,"Castro Valley, CA",0,11,,1.0,3/31/2015,"My family used to really enjoy coming here, but their service and food quality have declined over the past couple of years.  It took a while to get a table, and then even longer to get service.  Our server was very inattentive, got our order wrong and didn't seem to care.  Food had been sitting under a warmer for a while and was not appetizing. We finally had to ask to speak to a manager.  She was very apologetic and we appreciated her professional attitude, but unfortunately it was overall a very unpleasant dining experience. Would recommend eating somewhere else."
Stephanie C.,"Alameda, CA",99,13,1,3.0,2/17/2012,"I met a friend for dinner at the Pleasonton, CA location on a Thursday night. It was my first time at this location.   The Pluses: The head Concierge man at the reservation desk gave us wonderful, kind service and promptly, very pleasantly escorted and seated us at the bar for a drink when we asked.  Although we were told there was a 30 min wait, it was only about 15 mins! (maybe that was due to going on a weeknight, later on, around 7:30pm...the initial dinner rush had ebbed off, but it was still quite busy). Appetizer:  Got the crab-artichoke dip...very tasty.  Crostini it was served with was also good.   Alcoholic Drinks:  Friend ordered a banana pina-colada kind of drink.  She said it was good, BUT it cost her $9! (and it wasn't that big of a drink).   The Critique i have is with the FOOD and the WAIT STAFF SERVICE:  While the staff were pleasant and responsive when we asked for something, I was displeased that no one came to check on us mid-meal to see if we needed something, or if our drinks needed to be re-filled....I needed to catch someone's attn and ask myself for a refill because my drink was empty.   Foodwise, the quality of ingredients was excellent, but the dish lacked flavor. I had the combo of Chicken Madiera and Steak Diane.  While the steak was a perfect med-rare, as i ordered, and tender w/o grisle or fat, the meat itself really lacked seasoning. If it weren't for the pan sauce that came with it, it would have been utterly bland...and even the pan sauce seemed to lack flavor or any richness, probably due to fast cooking time.  I wanted to ask for some A-1 or BBQ sauce, but the waiter never even came around to see how our meal was going, not until the end of the meal to see if we wanted a to-go box and some dessert.   Upcharges:   While i was very happy to be able to switch out the side of mashed potatos for pasta with no extra surcharge,  there was an extra charge for having marinara sauce on it....i wasn't going to pay an extra few bucks on top of an already $20 dinner entree (not so cheap to begin with), so just took the pasta as it came, with some butter and parmesean cheese. I added my own salt and pepper...again, pretty bland.    Dessert:  I ordered the ""White ChocolateTruffle Rasperry"" cheesecake w/ chocolate crust...it's one of the originals they've had forever. While good, it was not as dense or raspberry-ish as i remember from the past.   Friend ordered ordered the Red Velvet Cheesecake....That was SOOOOOO GOOOOD!..rich, dense, and not overly sweet, as cheesecake should be. The cake part was great too  I'll order that next time! Cheesecake factory is a nice and popluar place to eat, but for the price and reputation of restaurant (which is definately for more upscale budgets, or special occasions). I expected more from the flavor of the food and a little more attn from the wait staff."
Genevieve H.,"Fremont, CA",3,5,5,3.0,2/1/2013,"*3.5 Stars* This was my first time going to the Cheesecake Factory, and it definitely wasn't bad. It wasn't superb -- maybe I'd been looking forward to visiting it for so long that I hyped it up in my mind so much that I found myself not feeling, well, blown away. We came Saturday evening, and because the place is so popular, they'd said they wouldn't be able to take reservations, which is reasonable. We came around 7-ish, and the lady at the front said the wait was going to be about 1.5 hours. Admittedly, it's a long time, but we just spent the time at the Macy's nearby and were called in 1 hour later (guess they overestimate a little, which is fair).  Here's what we ordered: Starter: Sweet Corn Fritters. I wasn't sure what I was expecting, but it was pretty good! They're generously-sized chunks of fried sweet corn in some kind of batter. Sweet, savoury, and crunchy. Main:  Cajun Burger w/ Sweet Potato Fries: -- Pretty good! Mind you, this burger is pretty hot (as in fresh off the grill, not spicy). Glamburgers such as this one are served with fries or (something else, I forget). Regular fries are free, sweet potato fries are an extra dollar. The bun is grilled to perfection, and I loved how the grilled onions and bell peppers complemented the rest of the burger so well. One tip: let it cool down slightly before biting in, or at least use a napkin to hold the burger. The juices are really hot and scalded my fingers when I bit into it :) Evelyn's Favorite Pasta -- I'm a little iffy on this one. The pasta itself is pretty good -- the oven-baked tomatoes added a lot of flavor to the pasta, along with the broccoli and everything else. This is my one complaint: when it was served to us, it tasted stiff and rubbery. The waitress told us it was cooked to al dente, which I understand means firm...but it was still rubbery. We ended up taking it home and steaming it before polishing it off.  Steak Diane -- We ate it medium-rare, and it was just like a steak's supposed to be, with a lovely pink center. Even my dad, who likes going to American restaurants, complimented it. Despite that, I didn't feel like the steak was...special. Good, but not special. It also came with mashed potatoes (with skins and chunks), which were delicious. I'm a potato fan. Bang-Bang Chicken & Shrimp -- Hm, this one didn't really leave much of an impression. It's a Thai-inspired dish that looks like a plateau of rice in a pool orange curry. I did try it last, and I was really full by then, so take this comment with a grain of salt.  Dessert: Tiramisu Cheesecake: Wow. It's tiramisu...but it's also cheesecake. It was sweet and indulgent without being too heavy. We polished this one off quite quickly! In all, it was a decent first experience. It did come out to be pricey (but then again, it's the Cheesecake Factory), but it was a fun experience! Will try again sometime, but maybe during a less-crowded hour."
Christina L.,"Pleasanton, CA",94,38,,4.0,1/2/2012,"A must when you live in the area. Before the one in Pleasanton arrived it was always a treat to go to the one on top of Macy's in SF. Since it came to Stoneridge iris usually the go-to for my friends and I. I have never had anything there that I didn't enjoy. The drinks, while expensive, are all delicious and the warm bread given before any meal is a treat and always has to be replaced. My most ordered dish is the Thai lettuce wraps, so good!"
Diane C.,"Brookings, OR",3,503,5,4.0,10/31/2014,"wow. i was wowed by the mail i received. i had the cuban sandwich (slow roasted pork, ham, swiss cheese, pickles, mustard and mayonnaise on a grilled and pressed roll.  served with french fries or green salad.) oh my was it delicious. the bread was crusty and warm, the cheese was all melted and warm and the pork was tender with no fatty stuff. the salad i ordered as the side was perfect - lots of greens with their house vinaigrette."
Emily L.,"Newark, CA",0,5,,4.0,11/3/2014,The food was good and the service was even better!! That's better than expected from a chain restaurant! I also love that it's attached to stoneridge mall. Usually the food options at malls are limited to the foodcourt. So I was glad to have this restaurant option when I got hungry while shopping.
Sowayla K.,"Tracy, CA",17,3,1,1.0,10/1/2014,"So.... Where do I begin?? I left elephant bars happy hour for Cheesecake Factory FOR THE BREAD and cheesecake. So my friend and I walk in and tell the host we're doing happy hour. We sit at a high table and after 5min or so a girl greets us and takes our drink order. Before she walked away I asked if they serve bread to happy hour seatings as well and she said yes. (If she would've said no then I would've sat at a regular table....)yeah I came for the bread!! So yes we took about 15min to order but hey our drinks weren't even at our table yet!! And neither was the bread. So I finally placed an order for the Asian chicken salad no onions dressing on side. Hello you have a book to write orders in it especially if you're ""busy"" and definitely if there are food modifications requested....i finally got my drink and salad. No onion but dressing was tossed in. I let my server know and because she didn't really seem to care I told her it's ok...it was NOT ok. But i stayed patient. We asked for our bread when our drinks came and then again when my salad came.""I don't know"" is what she says. As I was eating my salad I asked my friend to dig in, sorry no settings for her because the waitress used one of our two to greet another table. I'm a server myself, i know the cutting corners trick too, I just remember to replace the second place setting. After waiting 15more min of watching the server check on every table except us (avoiding us, knowing we were upset) I finally got up and waited at the side of the host stand for at least a min with three people there and none acknowledging me. A girl in normal clothes looked up at me then away without asking anything. Finally I stopped a guy, asked to change our server, let the girl (aka manager Melinda who finally decided to acknowledge me) know I wanted a different server and I've been waiting 50min for just bread now. Her excuse of being out of bread didn't work on me because like I told her the other tables sat after us already received their bread lonnnggg ago. She apologized, re sat me at a booth, spilled some of my margarita on the table as she placed it down. Never saw her again. New server took a little long to greet but was awesome. I told Matthew about the salad situation through hesitation not wanting to complain about everything but he was awesome about it and fixed it for me. Brought my desserts out very quickly and kept apologizing even though I told him not to. Nothing on my check was comped but hey we got a server that brought us bread in 2min upon greeting us! I'm a server myself and if my table waits even 20min for their appetizer/entree we automatically take care of our guests because we actually care! We don't ignore because of being uncomfortable. It's only a Wednesday.The restaurant was not even busy but everything took so long. Horrible manager on duty. I may be younger but I know how to treat others especially if I'm getting paid to keep others happy. This is the second time I came in over one year and the first experience was just as horrific as the second. Our entrees took over 50min the last experience. I'll choose BJs or Outback Steakhouse next time, thanks :)"
Kris S.,"Pleasanton, CA",3,27,,2.0,11/14/2010,"The food is decent although pricey but what is up with the wait?  I've actually shown up at a Cheesecake factory when the place was empty and was still kept waiting for at least 20 minutes.  I'm starting to wonder if they keep people waiting on purpose to make the place look more popular.   Gotta say, not worth the wait.  This branch is no different than other branches."
