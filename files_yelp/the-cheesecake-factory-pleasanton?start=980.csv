Sarah C.,"Rohnert Park, CA",135,35,2,2.0,2/13/2014,"This is now the third Cheesecake Factory I have been to and it's safe to say it was the worst. I'm not expecting 5 star service or food from here, but I do expected to be treated a certain way.  We arrived here on a Saturday night at 7:35, fully aware that we would be expecting a bit of a wait. We signed in with a young man named Gabe and were told it would be a 50 minute wait. This restaurant is connected to a mall so we went and dilly dallied about for about 40 minutes. We arrived back at the restaurant at 8:10 and my boyfriend went and checked to see what the time frame was. That is when Gabe informed him that we'd only been waiting fifteen minutes and that we still had another 30 minutes til it was our turn. Before my boyfriend could respond, Gabe turned away and gave his attention to someone else. He and I agreed to wait 8:35 (an hour after our original sign in) and then go somewhere else. At 8:35, I went up and asked when we would be seated considering we'd been waiting an hour when we were originally told 50 minutes. The nice young lady whose name I did not catch asked my name again and then got a higher employee (I believe, not confirmed) because they could not find our name. They both searched and then admitted it seemed we had been taken off the list. The higher employee immediately apologized, found a table for us, apologized again and had us seated. I informed her of Gabe's actions and thanked her for her response to the problem. The rest of the meal went fine, our waitress wasn't the most on top of things but I could tell her section was quite busy.  I would be willing to come here again but I would frequently check in to make sure I somehow didn't get off the list. Being someone who has worked in customer service and with wait lists, I know it can be crazy but what happened to us was just unacceptable. Very pleased with the two female hostesses who showed class and extreme competency at their job. Here's hoping it rubs off on some of their lesser attentive co-workers"
Allison M.,"Alameda, CA",110,15,,3.0,1/15/2014,"The menu is almost bigger than a dictionary, it literally took me 20 minutes to get though it and pick something out. Service was good but his interactions with us seemed very rehearsed and impersonal. The Cheesecake was amazing, as expected but my coffee sucked.  Please teach your staff how to make a cappuccino."
Steve D.,"Newark, CA",4,47,1,5.0,11/20/2013,"Honestly the service to the place was completely outstanding. Even though they were running late bringing our in dinner, they illustrated really great concerned about how long they were taking even though we didn't mind at all. Overall I enjoyed my dinner and best of all my dinner was completely perfect. If your looking for some good food and at the same time for some good service this place is a perfect place to spend your dinner at."
Henry S.,"Dublin, CA",387,1497,49,2.0,9/18/2013,"If you've been to one cheese cake factory, you've been to them all!  Service is slow,the food is not that great.  Skip it."
Ashlee V.,"San Mateo, CA",27,9,,1.0,9/1/2014,"Because I have to give a star... This was the worst experience ever! Came to grab brunch with our friends and family after being at a wedding last night. We had a sweetheart of a server and she let us know she was knew to the restaurant so we didn't blame this horrible experience on her. We had 6 people at our table, 4 of the 6 ordered the same thing... 4 meals were brought out at once and then nothing... The other two peoples dishes were nowhere insight. We asked our server when they would be coming out. She said she would go check and assured us that she placed them all at the same time... My father in law went to grab a manager to see what was holding up the other two meals. He said he would go check.. In the mean time all 4 if our dishes were getting cold as we have manors and weren't going to eat while the others couldn't. 20-30 mins later still no food.. I got up and went inside and grabbed a second manager who seemed to care a lot more about the situation. I explained to him what was happening and he said he would get it handled now. A few moments later the first manager came back out with the two plates of food and had a half ass sorry excuse. Once everyone had eaten we asked for our check. The manager came out and tried to explain to us that the general managers were here and that's why things were slow. Taking no responsibility at all he said he's a new manager and he doesn't have the authority to comp our whole meal but that he explained to his general manager that we had a horrible experience and that they should handle our bill. With that he told us our meals were on the house and to have a great day and come back soon.... Needless to say, we will not be coming back soon."
Krista T.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",208,159,4,4.0,8/11/2009,"Came here for the 1/2 of cheesecakes...ordered the vanilla bean, strawberry and carrot cake cheesecakes...all were super delicious!  Have always enjoyed the food at The Cheesecake Factory and the large portion sizes. The staff is always friendly and helpful. This particular location is almost always packed, so expect a wait...especially at lunch and dinner, so try not to go during prime hours."
Brian Y.,"Dublin, CA",0,4,,4.0,2/28/2014,"I had their Cajun Jambalaya Chicken/Shrimp pasta, Very tasty! Calamari was also on point. My partner had Salmon, mashed potatoes with asparagus, she's in love :)"
C Q.,"Palmdale, CA",1,24,1,3.0,8/6/2012,"hmmmm i have mixed feelings about this location, i was kinda disappointed because i lovvveee cheesecake, i thought this would be a more relaxed dinning but this place is sooo busy! But I can diffidently see this being a good place to stop for lunch but nothing to serious Pros  appetizers are pretty cheap cheesecake very good some employees are sweet Cons The menu is too big (takes way to long to figure what to eat) kinda odd but the table for two people are way to small!! can barely fit an appetizer an entree and your drinks on the table!  i hate those tables where your suuppper close to other parties! i hate hearing the couples next to me conversation when I'm trying to enjoy my own date! so there's really no privacy!  the staff isn't that friendly, drinks were always empty, takes too long to get appetizers, you look around for a waiter and they walk by and ignore you"
Hari D.,"Fremont, CA",24,78,,5.0,1/27/2013,"Went for lunner or linner (late lunch or early dinner); came home and checked the calories of dishes we ordered and found what: 1 visit @ cheese cake factory is equal to 2 days of daily requirements. Still giving 5* since it our responsibility to find out skiny items before we go to the restaurants.  Every dish we ordered was good. Thai lettuce wraps, strawberry lemonade, raspberry lemonade, long island iced tea, tropical ice tea, chipotle pasta, shephard's pie, shrimp scampi, herb crusted salmon, Jamaican black pepper shrimp and caramel cheese cake. The service was good too. But we are used to Valley Fair Cheesecake factory which is not busy as much; stoneridge mall one we had to wait for 40 mins even we went at odd time like 3pm over the weekend. Overall, good experience."
Josh K.,"Tracy, CA",0,10,,4.0,1/10/2012,"One of the favorite restaurants for my family dining. Foods and services are great but you gotta wait at least 30-min to 1-hour to be seated by a server. It is recommended to be there early, e.g., before 11:30am or 5:30pm in the weekend. Everything is great except the waiting is too long. Thai lettus wraps and chicken Bellagio are very good."
Mary S.,"Hayward, CA",38,25,4,5.0,1/4/2014,I went to the one that is located in union square in sf and had worst experience but last night I was out shopping  and wanted to give it a second chance so my friends and I went to Dublin.....just want to say Thank you to Michael who was our server he was the best server. He made sure we were well taken care of. My raspberry lemon drop was on point my dinner the Louisiana fried chicken pasta was on point loved everything!!!!  Most definitely will be going back for Michael
Billy A.,"Stateline, CA",7,17,2,4.0,5/19/2013,"I love the cheesecake factory, great staff, great menu selection, nice environment. Go here about 2-3 times a week, especially on Sunday mornings for brunch. Some cool tips, take advantage of their great happy hour, ask for Jason at the bar (lightning quick). They would get 5 stars but their only set back is the rude, insensitive, pathetic excuse of a manager Kimberly. She has no experience in ""customer service"" and puts up a lackluster performance as a leader. If you receive poor service and ask for a manager make sure they don't bring her out cause you'll want to pull your hair out (sorry for the analogy to all my bald readers)"
Racquel E.,"Mountain House, CA",57,449,346,5.0,7/26/2011,"My first time at Cheesecake Factory was in Chicago long ago, and I was so happy when they started opening locations in California.  This is my daughter's favorite restaurant. She likes the pizza, noodles, mac & cheese, fruit smoothies and dessert of course.  My favorites are the Thai Lettuce Wraps (satay chicken, carrots, bean sprouts, coconut curry noodles with the three spicy sauces - peanut, sweet red chili and tamarind-cashew), miso salmon, grilled mahi mahi, wasabi crusted ahi tuna.  My hubby either gets a juicy hamburger, chicken sandwich, pasta, or fish.  We like their strawberry and raspberry lemonade as well as their smoothies: tropical, peach, mango and strawberry.  Now for dessert, our favorite cheesecakes are: dulce de leche caramel, Godiva chocolate, chocolate coconut cream, tiramisu and caramel pecan turtle."
Glen G.,"Dublin, CA",246,255,241,4.0,10/18/2010,"OK, out of all your chain type restaurants CCF is probably one of my favorites and used to always look for an opp to go.  Mostly for it's vast menu.  Grand Lux Cafe is way better but there aren't many of them 'round here.  Now that I have one so close to work, going there is less appealing.  But still better than your lowend Chilli's, TGIF, or Applebees which have the same supplier of cafeteria frozen food that is just reheated. Normally I'd love me some of their avocado egg rolls or some jambalaya, but since I'm on the calorie conscious health shtick, I usually just stick to a Cobb Salad or the salmon since I know the calories on their other foods are ridiculously high now that I'm more cognizant of what's in there.  I wanted to go w/ something else and blindly opted for a ""grilled turkey burger""...sounds healthy right?  Wow what a mindfu*k.  Ain't nothing good about it.  Came to see it was 1,331 kcal.  Shit man, I coulda had me a real burger for that or two goddamn KFC double downs.  It wasn't bad, but come on... what do they do to these turkeys?  It didn't even have any bacon! Still a fan of this place but just watch out on the kcals and sodium.  The service is always good here with their enthusiastic wait staff.  Just try to come before the noon rush and you'll be good for lunch."
Tommy H.,"Castro Valley, CA",37,49,390,3.0,7/16/2011,"I enjoy eating at the Cheesecake Factory except the long wait. The wait here on Friday night and weekend is usually super long, but we manage to get a table outside with 25 minutes.  Price is a bit high but worthed. CF is having a promo for half price on appetizers and drink on happy hour 4 - 6 pm. Overall is good food, service and experience but for a long wait."
Annimai T.,"Sacramento, CA",298,137,540,5.0,12/19/2012,"Love their avocado eggrolls, warm crab and artichoke dip, mac and cheese, and house chardonnay.  ALL ON THE HAPPY HOUR MENU.  I love love love this place!!"
Faby B.,"San Leandro, CA",0,3,,3.0,3/22/2011,"Lets get started with the waiting time...... OMG its ridiculous seriously! I was turned off by the waiting time when I went this past friday at 7. Lets just say I didn't get seated till 9:24. Thats not including the time I waited to get my food. Not to be a hater but my chicken pasta was not fully cooked. I went from starving to being sick to my stomach. I cannot be surprised that my pasta wasn't fully cooked for they have thousands of people coming in. But what they charge, that shit better be cooked!  Now let me talk about the positives: - The waiters & staff are really friendly. - There deserts are DELICIOUS! Its better than the food. - The place has a nice vibe  -The RASPBERRY LEMONADE is the best drink (if not a drinker)  *THE DESERTS IS WHAT MAKES ME KEEP GOING BACK NOT THE FOOD!*"
Dj M.,"San Francisco, CA",3,102,28,3.0,10/19/2013,You can order the salads dry & try out different dressings! Yummy raspberry & strawberry lemonades too!
Bobby R.,"Dublin, CA",2,6,1,4.0,12/5/2013,"Besides the 30 minute wait for our seat our waiter Marc was amazing! He made sure our drinks were full, our food was hot and most of all he made sure our food was to our liking. I will definitely be back and will ask to be sat in his section.  His level of service is something that you do not see or receive in most outings.  Thank you Marc for turning a routine dinner session into an amazing night!"
Chris H.,"Union City, CA",59,38,30,5.0,7/9/2012,"No words can describe how good the cheesecake is. Appetizer I recommend avocado egg rolls, for lunch either chicken and avocado club sandwich or Cobb salad, dinner definitely some pasta or steak with shrimp. No matter what u get one thing is for sure u never leave hungry!"
