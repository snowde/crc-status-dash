Brendan H.,"Fall River, MA",38,16,,4.0,10/9/2017,"I have to say I am not big on chain restaurants so I wasn't expecting much, but was pleasantly surprised.  The food was great, fried mac and cheese and pan seared artichoke was excellent and of course the cheesecake was to die for! Our waitress was also one of the most attentive, pleasant servers I have ever had which really made it such a great experience. I will definitely be back!"
Anthony C.,"North Providence, RI",49,3,13,2.0,12/27/2017,"From the start.   No call ahead seating we waited in a cold area for 45 min The buzzer they wanted us to hold smelled like a dead animal.  It probably was not disinfect in weeks. We sat down in the middle of the restaurant and it is about 60 degrees.   I asked for heat and it just got colder the excuse is it is because the doors keep opening.  I would expect this from a small local tavern not at a million $ chain. Ordered food and they are out of 2 things I want.  I am here with a gift certificate.  We had to ask for water and a piece of bread for our meal.  So far I blame management not our server she is pleasant.   We ordered non alcoholic beverages.   15 min and the bread finally comes out no bread dish.   Our children are now waiting for food ours is here and getting cold.  I never eat without my children getting their food it is just plain rude. Food came out for all and it tastes great.  Portion is good.  We just went from a 1star to a 2 star because we are rating the entire restaurant experience, Not just the food.   Deserts are good but my Linda's Chocolate cake is frozen $9 per slice for a cake made in a warehouse not their kitchen."
Robert S.,"San Antonio, TX",4,29,6,1.0,11/24/2017,"Warning: do not visit here. If you do, it's buyer beware. Long wait times and questionable food safety.  Waited 90 minutes for seating after being told 45 minutes was the wait by the hostess. Warning, there is very limited indoor / outdoor seating.  Waited 10 minutes after seating for our drinks.  Waited another 70 minutes for food to arrive.  Yes, we made a poor decision waiting that long.  Then the worst started.  One meal of chicken Parmesan pizza had several hairs in it.  Another meal of chicken Parmesan pizza had pieces of plastic the size of a fingernail. Waitress stated that ""sometimes the kitchen just rips off the plastic on the frozen chicken and accidentally cook plastic into the food"".  After getting the bill, the waitress accidentally stepped on one of the children's feet (2 year old that just learned to walk). To be fair, little one was standing close by her side next to the table.  We had our meals comped. The Cheesecake Factory here is really far below standards. Our regular Cheesecake Factory in Texas never treats us that way in all our years of visiting."
Maryam A.,"Providence, RI",43,38,63,4.0,12/27/2017,"SHOUTOUT TO OUR SERVER BRYAN R! I've been to TCF more times than I can count, but last night's service prompted me to want to write a review. Our server was absolutely amazing. He was attentive, refilled our drinks numerous times and checked in on us every time he walked by. Usually the service here is okay and sometimes subpar, but last night we were very pleasantly surprised. Reason for the four stars is really their lack of appetizer options available last night. Also, the food is good, but not five stars good. We shared a fried cheese appetizer, since the stuffed mushrooms and  avocado egg-rolls we wanted were not available anymore for the night. It was good, nothing really memorable. I ordered the sausage and shrimp pasta and it was delicious. My friend had the four cheese pasta and the sauce for that dish was very tasty too. All in all a good place for lots of comfort food. Thanks again Bryan R for the great service!"
Kristen S.,"Providence, RI",13,86,171,4.0,8/30/2017,"I work in the city so I end up eating here about once a month. I'm not usually a fan of chain type restaurants and don't really care for places that have super ridiculously large menus, and even though this restaurant fits into these categories, I've always received really friendly service and have enjoyed the food here.  The appetizers, entree salads, and dinner plates like Chicken Madeira and the Factory Meatloaf are my favorites, but I've never seen anyone not enjoy what they ordered. Who can resist taking a piece of cheesecake to go? There's dozens of flavors and varieties to choose from, so pick something that sounds good and enjoy!  Pro tip: Sit in the bar area between 4:00 - 6:00pm Monday-Thursday and ask for their special bar menu. They serve many of their appetizers and small plates for $5.95 each - which will save you a ton of money and let you sample some things you may not have tried before."
Scott M.,"Providence, RI",26,15,20,3.0,1/6/2018,"If you have ever had the Cheesecake Factory before, you will feel at home. Consistent food which is expected at a chain of this size. That being said, the experience is made much better by some pleasant and very attendant staff. The wait to get a table can be long since it is attached to the mall and within walking distance of many of the downtown attractions."
Jennifer S.,"North Attleborough, MA",31,143,56,3.0,11/17/2017,"First, the wait is way too long. The table next to us were seated after us, yet were served bread before us. Not a big deal but that's a pet peeve of mine. The waitress is super friendly and checked on us a few times. I haven't had meat in months but decided to order my favorite, Chicken Constoletta. The asparagus was cold. Chicken was okay but nothing to write home about. I asked for extra lemon sauce for the chicken and I got it, thankfully because they never put enough on. Ok, so portion size is very large. It's enough for three meals. Restaurants should start offering half portion sizes with 25% to 30% discount. Many would choose the smaller portion which would be a higher profit. The best part of this evening, was the cheescake and staff singing to my daughter for her birthday, as well as the waitress. Otherwise the place is overpriced for subpar food."
Chad D.,"Providence, RI",22,15,21,3.0,12/29/2017,I got the Chicken Alfredo pasta. It was not anything special and was actually quite bland. They also took almost 2 hours to deliver this...
Mark M.,"Riverside, RI",112,45,52,4.0,11/12/2017,I've eaten here several times and never had a bad meal. It's a little pricey for a chain but I like the food.  We sat in a booth Wednesday night and the lighting was poor. We needed our phone lights to read the menu.  Our server was friendly and competent.  The fresh bread for the table was warm and delicious.  Our entrees were cooked perfect and seasoned well.  My espresso martini was off. Not sure what but not great.  Celebration cheesecake was more cake than cheese.  Bad decision.   Overall an enjoyable evening and we will return.
Tiffany W.,"Providence, RI",218,144,202,2.0,9/6/2017,"I don't know why I keep coming back really. Sometimes we come here for last minute convenience. This is not the same standard they held themselves to say 10 years ago, and I just can't justify the visits anymore really. My go to item was always the chicken cobb salad. Most recently, the chicken on it wasn't the same as it used to be and was just ok. They actually removed my hunny's go to item (Kobe beef burger) from the menu.  On the visits over the past year, we have tried the salmon, burgers, pasta, and salads. All were somewhat below average and not as great as we remember. Service has somewhat become hit or miss too.  Cheesecake never fails here though."
Mason M.,"Seekonk, MA",30,5,,3.0,1/2/2018,"Just ate at Cheesecake Factory, not for the first time though. It's always been an ok experience nothing special. Food was ok, drinks ok, and usually the wait staff is ok, but this time it was exceptional! We had Katie M as our server and she was amazing! Very attentive, very spritely, and overall made us very happy. We had a server before that and she changed out with Katie M and we are thankful for that as she was a lot more attentive and happy serving us."
Linda S.,"RI, RI",6,47,164,5.0,5/10/2017,"SO SORRY, Cheesecake Factory that I have taken THIS long to write a review! I have been coming here for YEARS and I will continue to be a Loyal, grateful customer. I used to go to the one in Braintree, MA a lot since I lived in Boston at that time. It wouldn't be as packed as the one in Providence only b/c there were other restaurants around the vicinity. I also noticed that the price of the Well-Mannered Dirty Martini in Braintree is $11 and the one in Providence is $9! Score!... Since I moved back to Providence and it is my favorite 'tini! I always call ahead to see how long the wait is. It is the only one in Providence so you have to expect a long wait time, especially on the weekends. I love the fact that they're open late to 12:30AM on weekends! You have to imagine how the hosts & workers feel with hungry, hangry, rude customers complaining about waiting 10-20 minutes. They must be stressed out with all those customers hovering over the hostess stands. Give them a break! I LOVE their food. I've had almost everything on the menu, no Lie. My favorite though, is Steak Diane (med rare), stuffed mushrooms ( that I cannot find the recipe for), fried zucchini, shrimp scampi, bistro shrimp pasta, tuna tataki salad....Oh man, the list goes on! But FAVORITE FAVORITE is the Steak Diane b/c I always seem to get that. The flavor is sooo delicious and that sauce?! I can't get enough of it. I dip the steak into it...mix it into my mashed potatoes! I will have to go digging for my old pics to post and it's going to make me want some more! They should open up another location in RI b/c one Cheesecake Factory isn't enough!"
Elizabeth S.,"Johnston, RI",147,73,195,3.0,5/27/2017,"Where does your daughter want to go after her college graduation? The Cheesecake Factory! We got there shortly after noon. Thankfully, there was no wait.  Our party of 4 ordered drinks and appetizers. The calimari was nice and tender, though I'm used to the garlic oil with banana peppers instead of tartar sauce and cocktail sauce. Everyone was happy with their entrees. The menu is huge, so it would be difficult not to find something that you'd like. I went for the Shepard's Pie, which was quite good. My daughter got the 4 cheese pasta, son got chicken and biscuits, and ex got the  shrimp and chicken gumbo.  Portions were pretty large. Nice experience for a chain restaurant."
Mary P.,"Cranston, RI",6,188,269,3.0,11/16/2017,"Well I will admit the cheesecake is the best ever! At 8$ a slice it should be. Not impressed at all with this place though. Went in the afternoon for dessert and it was slow. They tried to seat us in a small cramped table near the bar next to a family with six kids. We asked to sit outside and the man said "" I will have to check to see if it's ok"". Ok with who? Since there were six open tables outside. He went to the front desk where the woman said hey I guess it's ok. Like really? Why wouldn't it be! Disappointed in that for sure which removed stars for my review. I wouldn't suggest sitting outside though to anyone reading this. It's loud and the traffic is to much for conversation. People passing by swearing and seriously some looked like they would steal your bags of given the chance. The cheesecake definitely is why they got three stars from me. Other than that no go because of the way we were treated. They said it was because in case they got busy but they were not busy so why can't you chose where to sit? Next time I will get it to go as I always have. My mistake. Two cold brew coffees and two slices of cake 35$."
Trinh V.,"Wallingford Center, Wallingford, CT",66,26,30,2.0,9/7/2017,"My boyfriend and I knew that the restaurant gets super packed during dinner hours so we decided to play some quick games at the Dave & Buster's nearby and then stop in for dinner at around 10:45-11:00 PM. And just like we thought, the place died down a bit that evening and we didn't have to wait for a table.  We were assigned a nice waitress but the service wasn't great at all. Asked for some extra napkins for a water spill on the table but never got them, our meal didn't arrive until well past an 1.5 hours later, our waters didn't get refilled until AFTER we finished eating, and we still had to wait a good some time after we finished eating, got the check, and paid for it.  I can expect this kind of service during super busy hours but I was hoping to NOT since there weren't that many people there that night.  I would have given the place a lower rating if it weren't for their Oreo cheesecake, perhaps the only thing going for the restaurant (I would hope).  Too long, didn't read: this restaurant is super hyped so it's not worth stopping in. You're also paying a bit more than average for an average meal but what can you expect from a chain?"
Rachel D.,"North Providence, RI",204,94,781,2.0,8/4/2017,"Ugh. Why do I still keep coming back here? I wish I could give a better review but after years of coming here I just don't appreciate the food. The menu is the same as it's always been with the occasional new update. The portions are absolutely absurd and overwhelming. The bread is delicious and the cheesecake, if you have room, is quite delicious but very heavy. They changed there chicken salad and this is what killed it for me- it was very watery and hard large chunks. Not edible past a few bites. The service was extremely slow and irritating."
Elizabeth R.,"Providence, RI",86,107,120,3.0,4/10/2017,"It breaks my heart to give such a bad review to a restaurant I love but here is why... Saturday night, around 6pm, we are given an hour wait time. No big deal. We expected that so we killed an hour outside talking. When we finally get to our table, the girl waiting on us was very sweet. She was filling in for our server, Grace, who was on break. We ordered waters and then about 15 minutes later, our meals. He went with a bacon bacon burger with sweet potato fries. I ordered Parmesan herd crusted chicken with red skin garlic mashed potatoes and green beans.  Our food took a normal amount of time for a busy Saturday night. Our food was exactly how we ordered it. I only ate one of the 3 pieces of chicken and a few bites of the mashed and also green beans. It was amazing but I just couldn't even dent it. Our server Grace was back at this time. She took my food to wrap it up and we ordered a huge piece of chocolate cake to split. It was delicious.  She brought my food back and also our bill. It was only about $50 for the both of us and he put his card in with the check. Our server ran the wrong check with his card despite giving us the proper check in the first place. She charged his card $130 for the table across from us. This wasn't a huge deal. Just a pain and a stupid mistake.  We fixed that and left. Later that evening when I got hope, I opened up my left overs thinking I'd have some more chicken but nope! The girl sent me home with the wrong left overs. So gross. Someone's half chewed asparagus was in the place of delicious meal. This was such a let down. I had 75% of my meal left. That's the main reason I am doing. This mediocre review. I thought of calling the restaurant and complaining but it was just a mistake.  I'll go back again and hopefully have a better experience so I can update this review."
Mike A.,"Riverside, RI",49,34,7,4.0,7/14/2017,This is my daughters absolute favorite place to go with dad.  Food is fabulous and the service is always good. They do get extremely busy and sometimes there is a wait but it's well worth it. No better place for a yummy dessert after a good steak.
Shaun L.,"Westerly, RI",29,421,,3.0,10/12/2017,"Like most restaurant chains, you know what you're getting into when you visit one. The food, service and price is often predictable and that remains true with this particular location. This restaurant is an easy choice if you find yourself near the Statehouse or train station."
Stephen A.,"New Bedford, MA",102,50,62,4.0,6/16/2017,This place never ceases to disappoint! This time I came in just for some cheesecake and decided to get a slice of the Tuxedo Cheesecake! Wow oh wow was it good. Every bite was just a little piece of heaven. There is a reason this place exists and it's that heavenly cheesecake and variety of flavors. Thank you Cheesecake Factory.
Chantee L.,"Attleboro, MA",3,27,86,3.0,9/25/2017,Came here on a Saturday night with my boyfriend and my goodness it was super packed! For just us two it was a 45 min to an hr wait! I'm assuming it must be busy due to the WaterFire event they got going on that night. We were starving and really wanted to try the place out so we decided to wait. One hr later we finally got called in and you already know what I ordered first... the drinks! Drinks were a bit pricey but packed a punch. The Tex Mex Eggrolls really saved the day because if it didn't taste so bomb I would still be pissed for having to wait this long for food! Entrees were okay. It wasn't the best but it wasn't bad either. It really filled me up with their huge portions. Overall I would only come here next time if I were to be in town randomly on a weekday and starving to death for those Eggrolls.
Alex C.,"Warwick, RI",105,5,4,5.0,10/1/2017,"Great service, awesome food, delicious desert to go!! The menu goes on forever! There are plenty of vegetarian, gluten free, and even VEGAN options. This is a great place to go with a big party since the menu offered a bit of everything to make everyone happy. Also love getting Cheesecake to go because it keeps the fun coming even after you leave."
Sulay E.,"Jamaica, Queens, NY",115,1,1,1.0,10/20/2017,"I always have been a loyal customer to the brand, but this place has a great staff in regards to customer service. Even though that doesn't cut what I came for, the food was poorly prepared and was very tasteless. I ordered a chicken ceaser salad , and it tasted like a clove of garlic with cheese and the chicken was more like eating unseasoned cauliflower. My pregnant wife had a Cajun chicken seafood pasta that was so bland and noodles undercooked, now that is very unhealthy for any woman caring a child. They took the food off the ticket when she requested it from the waitress. I'm truly disappointed and this place needs to scrap the cooking staff. Another reason I gave it a star, is the silverware was set on the table and not even a napkin or anything to keep it from touching the table that numerous people have been sitting at. I wouldn't recommend this Cheesecake Factory to anyone."
W.H. K.,"Providence, RI",0,4,,1.0,10/18/2017,"What Happened to the Factory?  Was seated for 2 with my wife, the waitress walked by 5 times never said a word. 22 minutes into our outing we walked over to the ""To-Go"" counter, the girl behind the register looked me dead in the eyes, turn her back and went on break, Didn't even say hi...or someone will be right with you. 5 minutes later we walked out completely un-served. The floor is a Super greasy, it used to be by the kitchen only, now it's slick from the kitchen to the stairs, down both main aisles and even working it's way toward the bathrooms. The lights are always too dim, I wonder why? This place has gone from riches to rags they are a dead man walking.   Don't waste your money, for the same price as one dinner for 2, you can buy a frozen dinner, and the microwave needed to replicate this garbage. Please note how sad I am having to write this reveiw."
Mike F.,"Johnston, RI",9,67,158,4.0,2/20/2017,First off the service was really great!   The food was tasty and plentiful.  I really enjoyed the egg roll sampler but best if shared between two people to get the best tasty experience.  The Chicken Costolletto was delicious but needed more sauce.   The mash potatoes were like warm and needed to be hotter.  Overall a good meal.
Steve A.,"Riverside, RI",20,58,69,3.0,1/4/2017,"You know what they say about first impressions.  Believe it or not, this week was my first time ever going to a Cheesecake Factory restaurant despite having heard great things about both the food and desserts for quite some time.  The place was very busy, so its understandable that it may take a while, but I felt that the wait between apps, main course, dessert and even the check was quite long.  At one point we were wondering if they forgot about our table. The food to me, in general was ok.  The apps which consisted of calamari, nachos and stuffed mushrooms were all good.  No complaints there.  The entree I got was the spicy chipotle chicken on penne.  It wasn't bad, but it had some sweetness to it that didn't seem to fit.  Others that I ate with that had been there before commented on how the food tasted rushed as it was much better when they had been there previously.  The overall consensus was disappointment. For dessert I got the banana cream cheesecake and tried the Godiva and tuxedo slices as well.  All ranged from good to ok, but not good enough to makeup for the wait or the main course.  The apps and our server were the only saving graces from going with a lower rating though a 2 1/2 would be more accurate. As I told my girlfriend, I wouldn't say I'd never eat there again, but I wouldn't go out of my way to go back and its not on my list of places I must go back to soon."
Danielle G.,"Smithfield, RI",32,85,17,3.0,7/5/2017,"We went for dessert on 4th of July. The service was good and the cheesecake was good. It is pricey for dessert, but the serving are big. We had the anniversary cheesecake, the mango key lime cheesecake, and the salted caramel cheesecake."
Krid A.,"North Pole, AK",1,48,18,3.0,8/9/2017,The Cheesecakes are obviously amazing but should be toned down in price for me to be buying them more frequently!
Anthony M.,"Brooklyn, NY",132,125,1,1.0,6/14/2017,"Easily the worst Cheesecake Factory that I have ever been to. Came around lunch time and the wait-staff couldn't handle their own. Food took forever, waitress had an attitude and it took 15 minutes to get a check. On top of it all, drink orders and the bill were wrong.  Chain restaurants are on their way out and for good reason."
Yazmin H.,"Providence, RI",0,1,2,1.0,9/15/2017,"PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE. My boyfriend and I used to come here about once every two weeks and order food, drinks and dessert. In a regular night out we were waiting for our food and saw a roach that was crawling up next to me. We told our waitress as we did no longer want our meals (yet we're willing to pay for the drinks we ordered) and when she came back she just told us our meal was all set. We asked to see a manager because this is obviously a problem and no one came out. I called and they told me to call back at a certain time in where I did and never ended up getting transferred. Please don't waste your money here any longer. I wish I would have known this sooner."
Susan A.,"Easton, PA",5,172,28,4.0,8/11/2017,This place is reliable-you will wait for a bit on a weekend nite and then you will enjoy some decent food. The menu is ridiculously long but the food is good. More vegan options would be nice (why not a tofu option for many of the chicken dishes for example). Overall we enjoy coming here and the cheesecake is divine. All locations look similar so you know wha to expect.
Cheryl T.,"Attleboro, MA",12,2,,2.0,12/28/2017,"9 of us went there last night for my granddaughter's 16th birthday. We were seated fairly quickly, but it all went down from there. Service was very slow. We ordered our meals and waited quite a while before we got our meals. My father never got his. When The manager came over and apologized for not getting his chicken salad sandwich we told him it was chicken Parm. He said he would personally take care of it. Half hour later no sandwich.  Both were very apologetic waitress and manager but no sandwich. He finally got it boxed up when we were ready to Leave. When he got home and saw it it was so burnt he could not eat it. My meal was called but if I said something I knew I would not get fed that night so I ate it. My husband wrapped up his large portion of fish and chips and when he get home the only thing in the bag was the coleslaw. He asked for the coleslaw separate but not completely without the meal! Tried calling restaurant twice since then And ask for a manager but manager never comes to phone. Still the company was wonderful and we enjoyed it but do not think we will go back there again. The manager did take that the sandwich off the bill and along with a couple of other desserts."
Tingxin W.,"Providence, RI",0,1,,1.0,12/17/2017,"DON'T COME--BAD SERVICE. Last night I had dinner with my friends at the first floor. After we paid, the waitress did not give back our cards. We found out this morning and we had to take uber to the restaurant  to take them. The lady with glasses at the counter helped us take our cards back, without saying anything. So I explained the situation again to her, to indicate how their people caused our inconvenience. After hearing what I said, the lady simply relied ""ok, I give your cards back."" SHE DID NOT EVEN SAY A SORRY. She acted like it was my own fault. I once liked their cheesecake so much but I THIS IS MY LAST TIME HERE."
Rebecca B.,"Providence, RI",0,9,26,4.0,6/15/2017,"Came here on a Sunday night on the last night of PVD Fest after work with my coworker, her boyfriend, and a close friend/coworker. Waitress informed us that they were out of steaks and burgers. We took awhile to order everything -- mainly because we were all pretty indecisive, so I'm glad she was patient with us. For appetizers we had the mac and cheese bites and the stuffed mushrooms. Both tasted heavenly and mouth watering. For my entree I ordered the Chicken Madeira, which was two sautéed chicken breasts, mushrooms mashed potatoes asparagus and cheese, all my favorite ingredients. The dish was smeared with mushroom sauce and was a HUGE portion that I almost didn't finish! (But I did, because I was starving.) We finished off the meal with a chocolate mousse cheesecake slice, which we had to take home because everyone was so full. Overall, great meal, and great service as well."
Brendan K.,"Warwick, RI",19,8,,1.0,5/31/2017,"Went to Cheesecake Factory on Memorial Day around 830pm. It wasn't crazy busy, there was no wait, and there were many open tables. At no point did it seem overwhelmingly busy or hectic.  That being said, there were several issues that I could not let go. I am not one to complain about how long the kitchen takes to get food out, but our meals were pushing 30-40 minutes long. One both dishes finally arrived, mine was cold, and my dates pasta was bland and over cooked. She ordered shrimp scampi and she got a bowl of pasta with 4 shrimp (also cold). My chicken parm ""pizza style"" was room temp/ cold, as if it were sitting in the kitchen window for 15-20 minutes.  The worst part of all of it, was the waitress didn't even ADDRESS the issue ! No apology, no offer to take item off, no discount. NOTHING. After being in the service industry for over 10 years, this was something I couldn't accept. I will not be returning."
Jennifer M.,"Tiverton, RI",711,333,1303,4.0,8/30/2017,"Food was good, menu was huge and the service was descent.  I only WISH they did not print the calories on the menu!!  It certainly makes you really think twice about dining out and it almost makes you feel guilty.  lol  Anyhow... The Chicken Madeira was really good with lots of flavor as was the Bang-Bang Chicken & Shrimp.  The Cheesecake was good, but all in all, I still think I prefer Junior's Cheesecakes."
Suvidha B.,"Jersey City, NJ",26,4,,1.0,9/8/2017,"Worst experience. Went there on Friday night with my family for dinner. There was a wait for the table and while waiting my 11 month old son slept in his stroller. After waiting for 20 mins, when I asked for the stroller to be taken with me to the table they didn't allow it. Have to say, this restaurant is NOT infant friendly."
Donnie K.,"Philadelphia, PA",404,4,1,2.0,4/10/2017,"Once, I wanted to get a great experience at the Cheesecake Factory. But I should have known that if drake was fighting there then it can't be that good. Anyways, so I ordered a steak and it came like an hour later cold, and I was like tf? So she said hey I can microwave it. And I was Iike no, steak doesn't need to be microwaved. My best friends birthday was also going on and she waited 30 mins for a salmon, the waitress came back said oh we don't got that no mo and offered crab instead came back 30 mins later and she said oh we don't got that either. And so yeah it was a horrible experience but hey you learn something every day right so now don't come here But the cheesecake was good tho, can't knock that one extra star"
Jenna P.,"Lawrence, MA",70,93,150,2.0,9/19/2016,"I've been to this particular restaurant countless times now with various party sizes and have yet to be thrilled with the quality or speed.  A large group of us came in around 5 for dinner. We were told the wait was 2 hours or to sit at the high top tables - which we did, fine, no problems there. Our waiter was a cool guy and did well serving us. The drinks were well presented and of decent size. I asked for my mojito to not be too sweet. It was too sweet and progressively sweeter with each order as if my server or bartender forgot the detail.. Each mojito was $12.95.. which is a totally incorrect price for a chain restaurant. $10 would have been more appropriate. Their meals in general were, in my opinion, a few dollars more than they were worth in many instances too.  I ordered Baja Chicken Tacos. The tortillas were [for some reason] double layered and mushy to the point of falling apart. The rice you could probably chip a tooth on.  I only ate the inside of the tacos and small side order of beans. Most of the others at our table ordered burgers which were decent. I tried someone's fries when they came out and they were room temperature. One girl did not even eat 1/5 of her burger and our server did not ask if she liked her meal (she did not).  All in all, I felt overcharged and unsatisfied with the general quality of food. I won't be coming back."
Tony P.,"North Providence, RI",374,406,243,4.0,10/31/2016,"I have a problem with the Cheesecake Factory.  Don't get me wrong their meals are large and tasty.  Their salads are deceivingly unhealthy - loaded with carbs, calories and sugars.  I ate a 2300 calorie salad.   Their menu is scattered and confusing.  It's large and overwhelming.  It seems like I always need some time to process the massive project.   After a carb loaded menu - you can experience one of their delicious specialties - called cheesecake.  They are known for their lengthy wait times.  The Cheesecake Factory is fine - I'll avoid when I feel the need for portion control."
