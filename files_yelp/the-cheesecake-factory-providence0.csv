Queenie L.,"Las Vegas, NV",685,257,983,4.0,10/23/2012,"Their world famous brown bread is sooooo good... from Los Angeles to Providence!! They always been served warm and soft...  The kobe beef burger is to die for!!  The patty itself was very yummy and perfectly cooked the way i want it, medium rare, so juicy but not bloody!!  I like they buttered and toasted the bun, so many places out there (such as Joe's, sorry, I have to be more specific), u will be surprised they never bother to buttered before toasted the bun! When the bun is buttered, it wont be soggy by absorbing the patty juice! Personally i hate burgers/ sandwiches soggy, but who want them soggy anyway?!  I miss their appetizers platter which is no longer on the menu........... ;("
Danny C.,"Boston, MA",11,69,6,3.0,4/13/2013,"Moderately a good place to dine-in My favorites from Cheesecake factory are the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp and the breads that they give to start off But this place is usually very crowded during weekends so if you plan on going on the weekend, should plan well! As far as I remember they don't take reservations as well so..yeah."
Christine S.,"Providence, RI",36,83,4,5.0,3/11/2013,"I have only been here once for the first time last week & the food is delicious, portions generous. My waiter was attentive, helpful, polite & professional! I ordered the meatloaf & it was delicious, with a side of mashed & green beans. it was also my birthday so our waiter bought me a cheesecake with a birthday candle in it & ""happy birthday to you"" written in chocolate syrup. That was so nice that thay went the extra mile to make their patrons feel special. I would love to come here again. Wonderful, intimate, atmosphere with dim lighting perfect for couples and the décor is so elegant. when I stepped thru the doors for the first time it was similar to a romantic restaurant in Italy. I have nothing but good things to say about this establishment!"
Bub G.,"Sparks, NV",0,46,1,5.0,11/21/2014,"If you love a huge selection of food items to choose from, THIS is THE PLACE! Awesome   Mouth watering delicious deserts. Everything about this place Rocks! Only wish they took reservations."
Gina W.,"West Warwick, RI",6,15,1,2.0,10/25/2015,"We come here a lot. Probably too often, but the food and service has always been great.  Tonight was a totally different experience for us. Our waitress, Judy B, apparently had something better to do than to take care of us. Not only did we have to nearly assault her just to get her attention to take our drink order, but she never even checked to see if we got the correct food, let alone whether we were enjoying what we had. When we finally got a hold of her to get our check, after telling her we did not want our food wrapped to go, she merely removed of the food while we were still eating it. Worst server ever. If you ever have the misfortune of being seated in her section, I would recommend you ask to be moved. This was a slow night at the cheesecake factory. I cannot imagine how poor her service would be on a busy evening. Judy, I hope you got the message with the tip we left you. We tipped the bartender separately.  Well."
Nicola R.,"Huntington, NY",0,3,,1.0,5/18/2015,"Has the cheesecake factory in general ever thought about fixing there menu. To start with it never ends so how could all the food be good (because its not) and its so complicated that you can't even figure out how to close it after you finally chose a meal after an hr of deciding. Then you get the ridiculously priced meal and it is just okay. I order the cuban rolls and sweet potato fries, the cuban rolls were just okay and over powered by pickles and the sweet potato fries are way better at dave and busters. The server sucked and the service sucked. Someone at our table found hair in there food and they didnt even comp her meal they OFFERED to replace. I knew i didn't like this place to begin with and the experience just verified why."
Kathy O.,"Tiverton, RI",0,14,,1.0,2/24/2016,"My daughter wanted to have a party at the Cheesecake Factory for her 18th birthday.  She and nine of her friends were so excited to go.  I called to make a reservation for ten people and they refused to give us one.  With a group that large we would have to wait for hours outside on the sidewalk in the cold. We were told we could not call early either...that at least one of us would have to show up a couple of hours early and that ""could cut our wait time in half"".  When I told the manager that we didn't want to make a large group of kids stand outside like that he said "" large groups of elderly people, even with walkers and canes have to do it all the time"".  What an ass.  I understand not wanting to take reservations, but with a large group who will be on the list for hours...when you have nowhere for people to wait but outside on a street corner sidewalk in the middle of the winter, seems heartless and greedy.  We'll go to the Melting Pot instead.   It's a little more expensive there, but a least they treat their customers with respect"
Hannah R.,"Hartford, CT",1,19,,5.0,7/28/2012,"I've been to a few locations, but this one really takes the (cheese)cake! While the food was as good as it always is, what put this restaurant over the edge was the service. Our waitress in particular was a pleasure. So sweet and helpful, she helped my boyfriend sort through a bunch of enticing options for dinner and suggested drinks that we loved! Kept the water glasses full for the whole night and never let her smile slip from her face. Couldn't have been happier with that service! Only slight problem was that they were out of the strawberry cheesecake that we wanted, because they didn't have any that was defrosted (apparently CF serves frozen cheesecake?), but we subbed a different kind and it was magically taken off our bill! What a nice surprise :)"
Ami G.,"Providence, RI",25,99,,4.0,8/10/2012,"Six weeks ago, I declared to my husband that when I finished my semi-torturous session of summer classes, we would go out to dinner (on a weekday night) to the one place we never go to since it is way too busy on weekends but that we both mutually love and adore- the Cheesecake Factory! See, here in Providence, there is only one Cheesecake Factory, and it is epically busy on weekends, to the point you usually have to wait an hour or two if you go around a normal dinner time. We typically get there at least twice a year, but this year, we haven't gone once yet! In fact, since I became vegan in December, the Cheesecake Factory has been off of our radar!   Well that all changed on Wednesday night.  We didn't get there until about 8:30, and there was still a fifteen minute wait.  I wasn't sure how much I would still be enamored by the Cheesecake Factory now that I avoid dairy and gluten, but after my experience there, it is safe to say the Cheesecake Factory remains at the top of my chain restaurant list!   They brought out their famed pumpernickel and sourdough bread and butter, both of which I passed on but did have a love affair with in my gluten-eating days!  We started with their made-to-order guacamole, and I asked that they leave out the sour cream in favor of double salsa.   The guac is outstanding! We ordered it spicy, and while it wasn't really, it did have a nice kick that reared itself periodically. It was uber-flavorful though- way better than any store-bought guac I have tried, and honestly, it was better than the guac I get at my favorite Providence Mexican restaurant!   Of course, no guac is complete without an endless supply of salty, crunchy tortilla chips!   For dinner, I ordered their ""Skinnylicious"" fresh vegetable salad. Now a word on this ""Skinnylicious"" business- I think the only difference between this and their regular fresh vegetable salad is the pomegranate dressing is low-fat in the Skinnylicious version. Honestly, I could have cared less if I got the Skinnylicious version or the regular one, but since the lower-fat option was available, I went with it.    I did make some changes to the original salad- I asked that they leave off the cheese and grilled chicken, and instead add some pecans and dried cranberries. Out waitress warned us there was an extra charge for that, which I thought was silly because I was essentially just making swaps, but whatever- I did it anyway!   The salad was. . . astoundingly gigantic, to say the least! It was an awesome mix of greens, edamame (yay for vegan protein in a chain restaurant salad!), apple, cucumber, tomato, green beans, beets, pecans and cranberries. Everything was chopped into perfect bite-sized bits, and the pom dressing covered every single component perfectly. I have to say, this salad was epic (been using that word a lot in this post!) and incredible and I am sad I was only able to eat about a sixth of it!   The reason I couldn't devote my full appetite to the salad was because my husband and I made an ordering oopsie. He got a burger, and asked that the fries be on a separate plate so I could have some. However, I had my eyes set on sweet potato fries, so of course, I ordered them too!  You figured out what our oopsie was right? Talk about over-ordering! My order of sweet potato fries was about double the size of the ones he got, which in and of themselves were quite plentiful in the fry department! In other words, we had fries up the ying-yang, and since they don't come home as leftovers as well as my salad would, I had to prioritize and keep my focus on fry consumption. Ok, when you have fries this crispy-on-the-outside and gooey on the inside, perhaps my dilemma wasn't entirely so bad! I ate a load of fries, and they were so tasty, but truth be told, there still was a load or two left!   I am upset with myself that my stomach shut down so quickly.  On a good day, I could have eaten so much more of those delectable sweet fries drowned in ketchup. Back in the dairy-eating days, I would always follow up my meal with a huge slice of either the peanut butter cup or Oreo cheesecake. I am actually glad (for my stomach) that I didn't even have that option last night, as I don't think following up that enormous meal with cheesecake is what I needed at all!   The Cheesecake Factory, in my opinion, is like the Bentley of chain restaurants. The food is always so consistently delicious- in all my times going there since it opened in Providence years ago, I have never had an experience with their food that was less than stellar.with their food that was less than stellar. I am so glad to know it is quite possible eat there as a vegan and be beyond satisfied."
Mary H.,"Bellingham, MA",0,6,,5.0,12/30/2015,"Met some friends from out of town at the Providence Cheesecake Factory. We expected a busy night and it was!  It was worth the wait!  The menu is extensive - something for everyone. The waitress (Stacy) was informed and attentive. She suggested wine that we really enjoyed. The manager came over to greet us to be sure we were enjoying our visit. All enjoyed their menu choices, even sharing! Definitely worth a return trip!"
Eva B.,"New York, NY",10,38,,4.0,6/26/2012,"I've been to the cheesecake factory on multiple occasions over the years. I enjoy their huge selection and being a vegetarian, it's nice to go to a chain restaurant that has more than two vegetarian options on the menu. Their cheesecake is delicious, the only cheesecake that I will eat. They also have delicious pasta dishes like Garlic noodles and Evelyn's pasta which I usually get. Their raspberry lemonade is divine and their crispy artichoke hearts are the perfect appetizer. Just recently I went to the cheesecake factory with my boyfriend and I decided to try some new items off the menu. I got the farro salad which was absolutely delicious and unique with chewy farro, sweet beets, goat cheese feta, tomatoes, and crunchy english cucumbers. The salad was refreshing and as a small plate, just the right portion. In addition I also got the Sweet corn tamale cakes, which were also very unique. These mexican style corn cakes had a very yummy salsa verde, fresh pico, and creamy avocado pieces on top. However without the sauce the cakes tasted a tad bit too sweet and would have tasted better if they were cooked crispier and weren't so soggy. My boyfriend enjoyed his food for the most part, I believe he got the steak diane. On the downside however, our waitress was terrible. She put items down and ran away and was the slightest bit personable. I had to talk to two other male servers to get the lowdown on the tamales, assuring me that they were good. When I asked her she gave me a blank stare and seemed unsure in her answer to my question. she cleared our plates promptly, but didn't posses the best people skills. You usually cannot go wrong with the cheesecake factory, the only huge problem usually is the long wait. I get impatient when I'm hungry and this is probably one of the only negatives about cheesecake besides the occasion rude waiter."
Andria T.,"Providence, RI",70,198,17,1.0,3/10/2012,"In a city with as many amazing restaurants as Providence, there is absolutely no reason to go to a place as horrific as the cheesecake factory.  But people do, and I just don't get it.   I've been there about three times and it is always jam-packed with people.  It's like the mall at christmas time every day in that restaurant.  Here's just a short list of why the Cheesecake factory is crap. Overpriced. The food is mediocre. The decor is atrocious. It is incredibly loud.  And my biggest complaint--the unforgiveable-- THERE ARE ADVERTISEMENTS IN THE MENU (sorry to shout)  As if it's not annoying enough to pay those kind of prices for lame food, they are actually trying to sell you things right there as you decide on what to eat.  I found that so appalling that I actually wrote an email to the company.  They replied with:  ""Thank you for e-mailing us regarding your dining experience at our Providence Cheesecake Factory restaurant. I apologize that you were offended by the advertisements in our menu. For the past 20 years we have included advertisements to promote area businesses and to compliment our ""book-style"" menu. It was not our intention to offend you. I will certainly share your comments with our company executives."" The ads are not for area businesses, they are for handbags, cruises and the like.  And how does adding ads make something ""book-style""?  Books don't have ads, you morons, magazines do. I have more complaints about this business, but I'll just link to them: "
Andy O.,"Decatur, GA",9,74,5,3.0,3/18/2013,"I've never liked how you cannot make a reservation at Cheesecake Factory but I had a gift card to use so I went with my girlfriend. We got a table after a 30 minute wait (had a drink at the bar in the meantime). Our server was friendly and told us the ""special"" was Mediterranean mahi-mahi with mashed potatoes. Turns out that was just an unlisted menu item and that the real special was catfish. Since she didn't think it was a good dish she didn't offer it. I actually kind of liked her honesty about this. We both took her preference of the mahi-mahi and it was fantastic. I added a star for her service and care. The menu is a bit too extensive making it difficult to decide. The Lemondrop I had at the bar tasted too much like lemonade - I wouldn't recommend it."
Paul P.,"Cumberland, RI",132,114,262,1.0,4/23/2013,I just wanted to comment on the experience that we had on the 16th of this month.  My wife's birthday.  First off the waiter Jeremy F was rude and only came to the table really once or twice to get the order and ask if we wanted desert.  I wanted a little cheese for my scampi but never had the chance to even ask.  I have never in my life been so disappointed on going out to a place for a birthday.  69.77 on the bill and it wasn't even close to be worth that.  Mine a Steak and Shrimp combo for 19.99 didn't even come with a vegetable.  The wife's food Chicken Madeira was great and came with everything seemed to be worth the money.  The biggest problem was the service and i'm very disappointed in this.  I will be sharing this complaint on yelp also.
Angie B.,"Dayville, CT",2,54,121,4.0,4/11/2013,"How to begin... Have eaten at the Cheesecake Factory several times as a matter of fact their avocado egg rolls were in my dreams when I was pregnant ;) On my last visit we had a group of 4 and were very hungry so we sat on the bar side and was not expecting the same service as the dinning area, but to our surprise we had an awesome waiter! He was at our service and very attentive to what we needed as a matter of fact when our food arrived my so unfolded his napkin to get his fork and by accident dropped his knife, our waiter was there in a flash! And said ""I heard a knife drop"" and handed my son another :D  So to put it in a nutshell I will be returning, the only reason I did not give them 5 stars is due to the long wait and crowd but who can blame anyone, food is great and service as well."
Michelle C.,"Douglas, MA",91,138,41,5.0,5/28/2012,"My date and I arrived around 8:15 this past Saturday night expecting an hour wait or so, but because of the holiday weekend (I'm guessing?!) we were at our table right around 8:45. The host was so polite, sat us in a booth with a window overlooking the State House /State Offices. She asked us if we were in town to see the ""WaterFire"" which was happening a block or so away, and when I kinda gave her the ""huh?!?"" face she gave us the details of what was going on.. she didn't throw the menus on the table and just run away.. it was really nice of her. She definitely likes her job and it shows. Our server (Nicole?) was awesome, gave us time to look at the menu, made suggestions/answered questions for my SO (his first time there!??!) and made sure we were always being checked on, had water filled, plates cleared, etc. I always get the Thai Lettuce Wraps for dinner, he had Buffalo Chicken Blasts, Caesar Salad, and the Filet Mignon. Everything was so good, came out at the correct staggered times, cooked properly, etc. Instead of cheesecake we both had a Georgia Peach cocktail, consisting of vodka, and frozen raspberry + peach puree swirled all around in a snifter with a huge piece of mint. It literally tastes (and looks!!) like a yummy, frozen peach.. so good on a Summer's night. We took the advice of out server and host and checked out WaterFire. I guess it was the first lighting of the season and I'm glad they mentioned it to us. Made for a great end to our date. If I had anything to suggest.. I'd ask that a $30 filet be served with mashed potatoes and asparagus (or any vegetable, really) and NOT a big bowl of french fries topped with onion strings. Just sayin'.. = )"
Emily M.,"Spanaway, WA",5,72,14,3.0,12/8/2014,Fast friendly Service!. I had the chicken marsala and it was very bland I was not a fan at all!. My husband had a bacon cheeseburger they cooked it perfect but again it was very bland. The only highlight of the meal was the strawberry daiquiri.
Don L.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,21,,1.0,5/4/2015,"Server Kymberli F overcharged 3 meals, made up prices that weren't on menu, refused to adjust bill except for 1 meal after blaming the error on us. Overrated place and not worth the arguing."
Melissa D.,"Seekonk, MA",0,40,3,5.0,8/14/2014,"Clearly a well-known chain restaurant, the cheesecake factory definitely satisfied for our lunch today. The service was fantastic out on the patio and our meals were excellent.  I was extremely happy with the luncheon portion of the barbecue chicken ranch salad however I would recommend getting dressing on the side.  I can't ever really say enough about the cheesecake. This is definitely a safe bet!"
Angel T.,"Mount Hope, Providence, RI",2,3,1,2.0,10/18/2014,Never again. You might think ahh it's just one review.  Who charges 9.25 for a two ounce martini? And you are a big chain restaurant.  Overpriced. Overrated.
