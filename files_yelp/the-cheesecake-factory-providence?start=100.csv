L F.,"North Providence, RI",0,40,3,3.0,3/23/2017,Food is great.   Hostesses are rude.  25 minutes to get a a glass of water after seating.  30 minutes just to get the receipt cashed out to sign.  Actually still sitting in the car with kids waiting for my fri be to pay the bill. Unfortunately I will be back cause food is great.  Wish service was as good as the food!! Something for management to consider!!

Rena W.,"Woonsocket, RI",5,69,159,2.0,6/16/2016,"I usually love the Cheesecake Factory. I went in last Friday with a co-worker who took me out for lunch for my birthday.  We arrived at noon and seated promptly. When we were seated it took a bit for our server to arrive but I didnt think anything of it.  Then we ordered water and waited and waited.....I said to my friend ""why is it taking so long for water"" when it finally arrived. Since we have an hour for lunch we gave the waitress our orders at that time.  We each had a salad.  Then we waited and waited again....no salads....no waitress...nada until 12:40....as I was watching my clock. When she brought the salads. I said ""that was a very long wait for salads"".  I was shocked with her reply....""I will get you the manager"". There was no...""I'm sorry for the delay"" or anything like that.  Plus, I didnt even ask for the manager.  During the next 10 min, no manager came by, no waitress either to see if we needed anything, to ask if everything was ok, etc.  She came back and said ""did the manager come by?""  and I told her no.  The manager finally came by and I explained what happened. He said, sorry and left. I think the waitress should find another line of work or something."
Glenn W.,"Providence, RI",0,1,,2.0,10/8/2016,"Poor service tonight. One oder incorrect so had to wait 10 min to eat while waiting for correct meal.  Waiter forgot to bring bread to table and then remembered after about 7 min. Was told incorrect meal would be comped.  When check arrived there were 2 non-ordered meals on check. And, oh yes, they ran out of Mac and cheese dish initially ordered. No fun tonight at CCF. Doubt that we'll make it a priority choice in the future, even if the food is good there."
Brandy S.,"Warwick, RI",0,1,,1.0,4/8/2017,"Worst dining experience ever! We had a show to go to 2 mins away and wanted dinner first. The show started at 8:00 pm. We arrived at The Cheesecake Factory at 5:30 pm. There was an hour wait. We waited. We were seated at about 6:35. We ordered our appetizers and entrees at the same time. We asked to have them put in at the same time so we would make it to our play on time. Our food didn't come out until about 7:20. It was only 2 out of 3 of the appetizers we had ordered and no entrees at all. The waiter apologized as one of our apps hadn't been rung in at all. The entrees hadn't been sent yet. So he said he would put a rush on it. It is now 7:45 and STILL no entrees. We ask to speak to the manager. We tell him we cannot eat our entrees now and we need to leave. So, he apologizes and packs them TO GO. He tells us if we want we can come back after the show for free cheesecake to make up for it. Our bill was about $150, we were late for our show after wasting 2 1/2 hours of our time, and majority of the food collected condensation in take out containers in my car. It is soggy and nasty. To add insult to injury, we went back for our cheesecake at around 11:00 pm when the restaurant was empty and STILL waited 20 mins for a manager to come out and get it for us. I will never go back again."
Marsha C.,"Westerly, RI",0,8,,5.0,9/15/2016,"I had the Godiva chocolate cheesecake it is   excellent , as always this is my fifth time having that the diver chocolate cheesecake I highly recommend it if you are a chocolate lover. Not too sweet ,rich dark chocolate"
Marcy L.,"Douglas, MA",458,550,531,1.0,4/26/2013,"Lunch : that moment to yourself during the hectic workday.   Friday Lunch : ...freeeedooomm!  My department was ordering lunch today and, rather than be the ""party-pooping vegetarian locavore"", I set my preferences aside and went with the popular vote: Cheesecake Factory.  [shrug] -ok!  Each location has its own take-out menu, so I perused the 20pages of massive meaty meals to find (aaaaalllllllllllll the way at the end) the light/""SkinnyLicious"" menu of low(-ish) calorie items.  With pear and blue cheese in sight, I made my selection: Pear & Endive salad (claiming to be under 590 calories....good....it's a SALAD!) : Grilled Chicken, Endive, Radicchio, Arugula, Butter Lettuce, Roasted Pear, Blue Cheese, Candied Pecans and Tomato Served with Our SkinnyLicious® Vinaigrette"" $13.95.  Sounds pretty good, right?  I placed my order (sans poulet). Friday antics resumed until our coworker returned with the order.  The ""call-out, carton pass"" ritual ensued until we were left with one box, and my empty hands.  ""What the heck is THIS?"" my coworker joked and he poked at the last massive take-out box.  I peered inside at the scant layer of wilted greens and three tiny blue cheese crumbles.  ""Must be mine....""  I reported in a disappointing tone. The serving was LESS than my coworker's SIDE SALAD (yet placed in a MASSIVE box, perhaps to add extra insult for declining the poultry), and there was no pear at all (sooo it was a soft-lettuce and blue cheese CRUMB salad?....for FOURTEEN DOLLARS?!).  What I *DID* consume was relatively tasty; your typical ""sugared American salad"" to appeal to those who don't like vegetables.   I was 100% disappointed in the time it took to process the order, the flavor, and the most PA-THET-IC excuse for a FOURTEEN DOLLAR salad that I've seen in a long time. Lesson learned.  As the Genie in Aladdin said: ""Remember, bbbeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee yourself.""  I wasn't true to myself when I ordered this flop.  Cheesecake Factory: you might be able to fool others with your loud ambiance, your ""fresco"" décor, and your bajillion-calorie desserts......but in the city of truth, there are so SO many better options than your sugar-coated menu"
Robert S.,"Providence, RI",122,1126,804,4.0,8/6/2014,"The Cheesecake Factory has a great Happy Hour.      Go to the bar and get some of their great appetizers for just $5 each.      You can choose from nachos, sliders, egg rolls, fried mac n cheese, pot stickers, crab and artichoke dip, and much more.    Some of them are bar menu size, others are just regular size.  A great deal. Usually from M-F   4-6 PM"
Tish B.,"New Bedford, MA",32,33,65,4.0,5/3/2015,"An oldie but a goodie, the Cheesecake Factory (  )  at the Providence Place Mall is always a treat. Going there as a part of Tom's Birthday dinner, was a treat. Always a beautiful restaurant, well kept, and great waitstaff.   While we have been here many times, the large selection on their menu always causes a long debate. However, this time I couldn't branch out I had to re-try the Orange Chicken. I had ordered this previously at a different location. it came out beautifully garnished and with a strong orange scent. Who would think, Chinese food at the cheesecake factory could be so delicious. The flavor was one of the boldest flavors I have experienced when ordering Orange Chicken. My only disappointment was the lack of sauce, I live for the extra sauce on the place and due to the beautiful garnishments and presentation there was no extra sauce to be had! This was such a light, refreshing chicken dish prepared with a light and crunchy coating.    Louisiana Chicken Pasta, this was an AMAZING dish. This was a  Parmesan Crusted Chicken Served Over Pasta with Mushrooms, Peppers and Onions in a Spicy New Orleans Sauce. The New Orleans sauce was to die for!! Such a bold cream sauce, packed with flavor really made the dish. The chicken was perfectly coated and baked, but the best part was the sauce... I truly cannot rave enough about this sauce! This is a MUST try dish, that we will be ordering again!!"
Russ R.,"Exeter, RI",3,33,91,3.0,10/23/2015,"This is my first time going there (10/27) Heard from many people how good the place is. Unfortunately I don't share the same sentiments.  I ordered Chicken Marsala ( a standard faborite at many places I dine at) it fidn't taste like any Marsala I've ever had before, in fact, it was very tasteless, watery, amd bland. The sauce was blah!  Prior to the meal, we were brougt warm bread ( always a good move for a restaurant) but the white bread was too hard to eat.  Ordered their namesake = cheesecake.. Good, But nothing record breaking!  While we ate rather inexpensively, I have had much better for less elsewhere.  I will give another chance for redemption, so we shall see!"
Kelsey M.,"Warwick, RI",0,34,3,5.0,3/12/2017,The Cheesecake Factory was very fast in responding to our negative situation and resolved the issue right away. Mistakes do happen so I really appreciate it! We will be back!
Courtney C.,"Long Beach, NY",216,197,95,5.0,9/9/2015,Fantastic as always - great service and the biggest salads we have ever seen. Had the BBQ ranch salad and a side of guacamole (which was massive). Difficult to resist the temptation for cheesecake after it all!
Tea L.,"North Providence, RI",0,8,,2.0,3/9/2017,"Definitely had one of the most bad dining experiences here. First, let's talk about how they do not take reservations on weekends ( their busiest times) I personally do not understand this logic. Because as soon as you walk into this restaurant it's like trying to enter a club..it's literally shoulder to shoulder ridiculous. The wait was 45 mins (ended up waiting over an hour). That's fine, it's expected on Saturday night. But ..but.. how do you not take reservations, knowing how busy this restaurant gets and have a waiting area big enough to seat two ppl! So it literally is comparable to chaos in there. For such a huge restaurant they definitely could do better with the seating issue. Now when me and my friends finally were seated. We waited about 10 mins just for our waiter to get to us (with no water) then waited an additional 15 mins for our drinks. Still, with NO water. The waiter did not bring us anything the whole time we were sitting at the table like idiots with bread with nothing to drink!! Our waiter was ALL over the place could not focused and we could barely get his full attention for more than 60 seconds. The only reason I'm rating this place 2 stars is because the food no doubt was DELICIOUS. I mean after waiting 35 mins for it it's better be right? Anyways, after finishing our food and asking for our check. We waited 15 mins before our waiter shouting about how his house was on fire and had to leave immediately. So he left and we sat at table again like idiots waiting for our check with no one waiting on us... finally we caught the attention of another frazzled waitress and got the hell out of there. Love the food here, HATE the service."
Ryan D.,"Providence, RI",393,218,3,4.0,7/16/2015,"The Cheesecake Factory is one of the few chains that brings me back. Why? Consistency and always adding items to the menu that deserve to be on there for years. The good thing too is if you want to eat healthy, you can (I know sans cheesecake) but if you want to treat yourself, CF is there for you too. An underrated cocktail selection is always on the rotation for the season. Service is always top notch. The only issue that many complain about, no reservations. Key for you then is to go to CF on a weeknight right around 5-6. You try on a weekend and you will be waiting for at least 45 mins."
Connie W.,"Cupertino, CA",231,48,758,3.0,6/4/2014,"I have a friend who loves cheesecake as much as I do - she and I have tried all of the cheesecakes here. The winner of our ""Cheesecake Bracket"" was the Red Velvet, but I like to save it for special occasions. If I were to get a cheesecake on a regular day, I would go for the lemon raspberry (the tangy lemon mousse and ladyfingers keep it light, and the raspberry sauce is actually surprisingly genuine), tiramisu (fun and creative interpretation of an Italian classic), or the cherry cheesecake (the classic with sour cream topping and a cascade of sweet and tart cherries - only for cherry lovers!). Oreo Dream Extreme is also amazing, if you like oreos (profound, eh?).  Why the 3 stars? While service is usually good, once in a while there's a waiter with an attitude. Also, the savory food is really not that special. The only savory food I would order again is the blue cheese, pear, and walnut flatbread - a cliche yet scrumptious combination of sweet, salty, nutty flavors. The perfect appetizer to a dinner of cheesecakes (you need something savory to keep yourself sane). As long as you make cheesecake the main event, you'll have an enjoyable time. P.S. You know that brown oatmeal bread they give you? That stuff is good with whipped cream/cheesecake smeared on top. You're welcome."
Nicole O.,"Little Compton, RI",31,17,11,2.0,9/16/2016,So they really screwed up. We took an outdoor table to save time and the kitchen messed up somehow. We waited an hour and a half for a salad and cold sandwich. The manager said sorry. Really?
Jessica E.,"Los Angeles, CA",577,156,520,4.0,9/19/2014,"I love their Happy Hour!!! It makes me want to sing.  Monday - Friday, 4-6pm, $5 apps My favorite appetizers are: The fried zucchini with ranch sauce. I don't even like zucchini! The Tex Mex Rolls (yessss!): $9.95 The crab cakes (more like crab balls) are pretty good! $12.95 The location is splendid - right in the mall, so you can shop and then draank! The drinks are not the strongest, but their not weak. I also love the fact that the space is always brightly lit during the day with a lively, trendy vibe. The Cheesecake Factory is a good go-to for Happy Hour or dinner with friends. Everything I've tried has been satisfying thus far.  Parking Available in the Mall Structure"
Mandy D.,"North Providence, RI",387,282,537,4.0,5/31/2014,"I hate to admit it, but I really do like The Cheesecake Factory. I'm not a huge fan of chain restaurants and this place is wicked overpriced, but as much as I want to hate them, I just can't! Every time I come I have to get the fried mac & cheese. It is like heaven. They make balls of mac & cheese and then bread, deep fry them, and serve over a pink/red sauce. They are so cheesy, crispy and addicting! Recently my boyfriend ordered the pear & blue cheese flatbread, and it was one of the best things we have ever eaten. The combination of flavors was wonderful and all of the toppings were very fresh. The blue cheese crumbles were HUGE and had a bit of a nice smokey flavor. Our only complaint about it is that the serving was much too small. We also loved the zucchini, portobella and avocado fries. They were nice and crisp and not greasy or soggy at all. On the side it came with two dipping sauces that were very good. Once I'm done eating here, I never have any room for cheesecake.... and that's sad because it's really the best part. Luckily they can always box up some slices for you to take home. I've never had an issue with the service here. They've always been nice and well trained staff."
Sira K.,"Providence, RI",144,71,37,2.0,6/18/2016,"My husband and I have always loved Cheesecake Factory. We usually try to avoid Providence Place, but just for Cheesecake Factory, we come every once a month. However, we won't be back. Sadly, the meal we had last night was absolute disaster.  Including our 20 month old daughter, we were all up last night due to diarrhea. Our butt is on fire. It must not have been fresh at all. Very upsetting. We used to love this place."
Elizabeth W.,"Burrillville, RI",50,20,2,4.0,6/18/2016,"My new favorite place. Good food, I was sat right away, and our waiter was very polite."
