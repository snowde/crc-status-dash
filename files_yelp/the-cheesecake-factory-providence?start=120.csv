Holly E.,"Seekonk, MA",14,39,9,4.0,3/13/2015,"No matter how annoyingly big the menu is, how crowded it is on a Friday or Saturday night, or how ridiculous it is that a pasta dish is $15+... I will forever keep returning The Cheesecake Factory.  Sure, it's a little pricey for a chain, but the portions are incredibly huge. If you're super hungry, it's worth it, or you can take home leftovers. Win-win. I have a love affair with the Chicken Bellagio. I remember when it was a new special on the menu years ago and I'm so happy they made it a permanent menu item. I have a really hard time ordering something other than that when I'm there, but I'm getting better at venturing out. It's easy with such an insanely big menu. The nachos are amazing but more filling then you could ever imagine (even without chicken on them). My boyfriend and I made that mistake... ordered nachos for an appetizer and got entrees. Never again. Now if we're in the mood for nachos, we get another small appetizer to split. Usually the chicken sliders. They're amazing. My boyfriend was only disappointed in his meal once -- a Hawaiian pizza that was seriously undercooked and looked like it was frozen. He didn't eat it, we were comped, and it was okay. Now, he stays far away from the pizza. Luckily, there are a million other options for him to try. We always get cheesecake to go, because I would actually be worried about my well-being if I tried to eat a slice of cheesecake after such huge portions.  Overall, I really do love it here. It's one of the only chain restaurants I don't mind frequenting."
Soenke W.,"Bremen, Germany",1,37,,4.0,7/13/2016,"Great place for great food! We had Burger, Chicken Sandwich and Cheesesteak and my daughter said ""Dad, this was one of the best burgers I ordered this year!""."
Alex T.,"Providence, RI",1,144,33,4.0,6/21/2016,"Really great food! It lives up to its well known name here. The servers are very nice and we were seated very quickly as walk ins. The parking is great because its either on street or in the garage of the Providence Place Mall since they are attached, so its very convenient. Definitely give it a try if you haven't already!"
Kemi K.,"Sacramento, CA",0,20,6,1.0,3/31/2016,Absolutely terrible experience here. The night started off ok and our waitress seemed nice and whatnot but after placing our order we waited 20-30 min for our meal to arrive with no assurance from her. she took it upon herself to entertain the table next to us who arrived after us and brought out all 3 plates of their food without even acknowledging us still. I honestly felt like we were discriminated against or they just really have horrible customer service but I will never return to this establishment or a cheesecake restaurant ever again. this is the 2nd bad experience I've had at a Cheesecake Factory in 2 completely different locations. West coast/east coast. I'll stick to Bj's from now on. I would suggest the same for anyone looking to be treated with respect.
Brett W.,"Yarmouth Port, MA",0,11,,2.0,1/1/2017,"Not too good. Appetizer took over 30 minutes to arrive at the table. The pot stickers were burnt on the bottom. The main course came 40 minutes later. My steak was cooked wrong. I opted for the chicken Madeira instead. After another 30 minutes of wait time, I threw on the towel and told the waiter to just send me the check. My wife and kids had already finished their meals. Food was mediocre. I informed the manager on duty and she said they were busy and their cooks are overwhelmed. We won't be back."
Jason P.,"Providence, RI",0,13,,1.0,12/10/2016,Waited about an hour for a sandwich.... waiter tried to offer us a free dessert for the wait .... we put our jackets on & walked out....
Taylor K.,"New Bedford, MA",2,25,3,4.0,5/14/2016,Pricy but definitely worth it! My favorite is the Salmon. I don't advise getting an appetizer because the bread is filling and delicious!
Jeannette G.,"Bronx, NY",3,17,,1.0,12/5/2016,"Today my boyfriend and I attempted to have lunch at the Cheese cake factory, what an epic fail! Our waiter Carlos was pleasant and professional. The kitchen staff and management is probably to blame for our disatisfaction. We arrived at 1:20, placed our order as soon as we were seated, we literally waited an hour for our food which never arrived. We only ordered two sandwiches, I do not think it requires that much time to prepare especially when the restaurant was not very busy. Our waiter did come and apologize for the wait and stated our food was being plated, 20 minutes later Carlos returns again to apologize as well as to offer us free dessert, very tiny consulation for waiting an hour for food that never arrived. I am not sure what the issue was with our order, but it just didn't make sense. Needless to say,  we got up and left. I think the manager should have came to our table and talked to us instead of our waiter. A free dessert was not going to change the fact that our food was taking way too long. Even if it did arrive an hour later at that point I would not have felt eating the food anymore. Sadly, I will never return to this particular location again. It seems they do not know what they are doing. And the manager doesn't show his face."
Shawn T.,"Los Angeles, CA",42,262,622,4.0,6/27/2014,"We had dinner here and ordered from the ""skinny"" menu.  Burger was good, fries were good, and the steak medallions were great!  No problems with the service."
Bagman P.,"Attleboro, MA",1,1,,1.0,6/27/2016,The blonde lady at the front desk just had me standing there today like I was a lump of Cheesecake. I was ignored while waiting for service then she turned her back to chat with her co-workers. After I got tired of waiting  I asked if it was policy to ignore Black customers. Maybe I was right because she walked away without even acknowledging me and returned with her manager. I'll NEVER go there again.
Meg N.,"Millville, MA",15,72,6,1.0,2/28/2016,"Just get the damn cheesecake to go. My family had a gift card that we received at Christmas for this fine establishment.  We arrived at the restaurant around 730pm on a Saturday and were told that the wait would be approximately an hour for the four of us. We were find with the wait (its Saturday night, there is going to be a wait wherever we go) and were handed a pager.  Around 845, we still had not been paged/called. I went up to the host and asked how much longer our wait would be, seeing as how they told us an hour at 730. He said that we were next on the list and it shouldnt be any longer than 10 minutes for a table. At 9, I went up again to the host. Said it had been 15 minutes, and asked if we had been forgotten as people who were waiting that arrived after us were being seated. He said we werent on the list, and insisted that he had paged us 10 minutes ago. I had the pager in my hands. It had never gone off.... He said ""Im paging it right now."" as I held that pager that was not going off right in front of him. So, CLEARLY your pagers are not working properly and your ignorant host(s) have no clue what they are doing... Fast forward to when we order, my husband and I ordered salmon and pasta, both of which came out together... My SIL and BIL food was no where to be found. TEN minutes later, the waitress walks by and notices that they dont have their burgers. She comes back with the burgers and tells us the places are EXTREMELY hot... which in the restaurant world means ""Sorry, your shit has been sitting under the heat lamps for a long ass time so if it tastes awful, my bad."". My BIL and SIL didnt touch their burgers, they were completely inedible. They looked disgusting. The waitress took both burgers off the bill... By this time it was close to 11pm... We got cheesecake to go and left..  Which is what we should have done to begin with. NEVER AGAIN."
Margaret G.,"North Providence, RI",104,176,104,5.0,3/1/2015,"Been a fan of Cheesecake Factory for years. This location is very similar to others I have been to. The wait can be very long if you come in on the weekends, sometimes as long as 1-2 hours. Today after shopping for bridesmaid dresses with my bride-to-be sister and her bridal party we decided to treat ourselves and ensure that we will never fit into said dresses. The bread - amazing, as  always. Our waiter was nice and attentive, which is usually my experience here. I ordered one of my faves, the chicken bellagio. Two large chicken cutlets over pesto pasta and a small arugula salad. Everything was prepared perfectly and tasted great. We skipped dessert (I know, a sin) as we were all very full and hoping to not have to be rolled to our cars.  The menu is extensive and the cocktails are always very good. Depending on what you order it can be a bit pricey but it's almost always worth it. I def come here when it's time to splurge and have a cheat day."
Leela S.,"Seattle, WA",47,857,126,3.0,6/10/2014,"If you're ever up for a gastronomical challenge, come finish a single slice of cheesecake by yourself without exploding from either being too full or too overloaded with sugar. No, they're not terrible; they're just giant, giant slices which are extremely sweet. Sizes follow the same gargantuan theme when it comes to entrees. However, I find the entrees overpriced simply because they aren't tasty enough to justify ~$15 a plate! You will probably get a meal and a half out of the serving, though, so I guess there's that. This is a good place to come with a big group because they have oodles of seating available. Their menu is also varied enough to cater to a wide range of palettes; everyone in your party is likely to find something they want (vegetarians included). Service has always been pretty good in my experience. Pity about the quality/price disconnect, really."
Lorraine R.,"Anaheim, CA",47,34,59,5.0,4/22/2016,Now I have been to Cheesecake Factory many times at home in California.  First time trying this location and  This time I am stopping by to leave a review. Six sassy gals decided to stop by last night for dinner and drinks. Now we were a but needy and a bit animated. We are in town for a convention.  We come every year in April. Big giant shout out to Jay for dealing with our antics with grace and a smile. We were a handful.  He is am excellent waiter who saw to our every need. Even recommended wonderful things for the undecided amongst us. I know we were overly excited to be in town and probably not the easiest group (vegans and vegetarians and drinkers lol). Thank you for your patience Jay. You rocked. We appreciated you.
Em B.,"Boston, MA",135,197,935,2.0,12/20/2015,"Came here last night at 11, was able to get a table.  We were tucked by the bar and ordered drinks, & pot stickers. The drinks were very good, the pot stickers were overdone and burnt. The waitress Mariell was very nice and attentive. I didn't like that the table wasn't properly set up, and waitress could tell I was dissatisfied and made sure to be very accommodating."
Amanda F.,"Warwick, RI",0,1,,2.0,12/6/2016,"Not very impressed. Got seated quickly but was seated with a terrible server. Two girls were sitting next to us (on a 2 person table) a third girl joined them and asked if they could slide another two person table over. He was very rude about it and was clearly agitated. The girl said she could do it herself but he insisted he do it. He started to push the table over and stopped, gave all three of the girls a dirty look then said to the third girl ""Could you move?"" Poor girl had to get up out of her seat when she easily could have moved the table herself without any problem. Anthony needs to get it together, he does not belong working in this industry if he is acting this way towards customers."
Megan L.,"Milwaukee, WI",46,240,793,2.0,1/4/2014,"Well, the CCF is your run of the mill restaurant and extremely overpriced. And I mean EXTREME! Like...unnecessary.  None of the apps are cheaper than $8 that I saw. Most were around the $9-12. And we're just talking apps people!!! This isn't some fancy, 4 or 5 star restaurant. This is the CCF...a chain restaurant. Okay. I got the chicken quesadilla app. It's HALF a quesadilla, 4 slices. This is a perfect portion for an app to share with someone before a meal....for $6 not for the $12 it actually cost. And because everything is so overpriced, I decided to only have an app as my meal. However the price, it was a decent quesadilla. Not the best, but I enjoyed it.  The cheesecakes that I took home were $15. This I don't mind because I'm not about to make a banana cream cheese cake for fun at home. It was by far the best cheesecake I have ever had! Ugh I really loved it. I've also had the Oreo, which is good, but was just too rich for that whole piece.  So I gave the CCF 2 stars because there were only two good things about our visit. 1) banana cheesecake 2) our waiter was super friendly and honest about the food when I asked.  Atmosphere is fine. It's huge! And loud, but so am I, so that balances itself out. No long wait on a Saturday for lunch. Too many options on the menu. Overpriced. Will not be returning except to get cheesecake."
Be E.,"Revere, MA",7,44,,3.0,3/10/2015,"I came here from MA to meet up with some friends. We arrived to an almost-empty restaurant at 11 am on a Sunday, and by the time we were finished eating, the restaurant was PACKED. The nice thing about Sundays is that they offer brunch! It's a little something different. The food is good, and a bit cheaper than lunch or dinner offerings. Come early!"
Stephanie C.,"Mansfield, MA",0,6,1,2.0,12/7/2014,"Came here on a Sunday night with my bf. Don't get the water until 15mins after seated. Don't get to order until 15 mins later. Total wait before the server got our order was 30mins. I ordered salmon with medium diane steak and my bf ordered scrimp gumbo. The dishes don't come after another 30 mins. The steak (chunks) was fully cooked even slightly burned, and they looks like pieces cut off from the side of other bigger steaks. We told the server and she put in another order so I didn't get the steak I'm hoping for until another 30mins. And you can see the host is not very happy about our request to replace the dish.  Our total stay in the restaurant was about two hours and it completely ruined out movie plan. Pretty disappointed about this CCF branch."
Carolina O.,"Boston, MA",0,9,7,1.0,10/10/2016,"They manager of the Cheesecake Factory was not only extremely rude, but uneducated regarding service dogs in restaurants. She did not know the regulations and tried to tell my friend that his animal was of allowed. None the less it ruined our meal and left us both with a bad test in our mouths."
