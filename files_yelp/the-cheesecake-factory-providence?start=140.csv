James B.,"North Providence, RI",152,70,138,4.0,3/30/2014,I go here south because I work almost right next to it!! Love the food and the portions they give!! Not to mention the cheese cake is out of this world way to many to choose from! Big downfall is that you might have to wait like an hour for a seat at times because of holidays or even weekends! Bummer food is so good' not to mention  service is Superb!!
Jef S.,"Providence, RI",97,552,,4.0,12/30/2013,"A-ok. I brought in my two little guys for lunch today, and we had a nice time. I'm not one for chain restaurants, and normally I wouldn't be caught dead spending my money here. But we had a gift certificate and gave it a shot. I've been in CCFs all across the country and their m.o. is always the same: we'll make you wait at least an hour for a table, feed you a ton of food and overcharge you for it, and you're gonna like it, beeyatches. And this CCF is ALWAYS mobbed. Ahem. In spite of this philosophy, today was pretty good. We went right at open and there was no wait. Our server Heather was friendly (if not overly chummy), very helpful, and delivered everything with the quickness. The kid food was kid food, but well presented. The rugrats thus satiated, I settled on a Firefly margarita (egads, sweet! But still a good margarita), Ahi Tartare (bomb, but not a large enough portion to my liking...wonder if they have it dinner sized?), and Asian Chicken Lettuce wrap tacos....really very tasty with great topping sauces. And the brown bread. Gotta love the brown bread.  The price tag was surprisingly cheap, as no single plate was more than $7... The margarita was the most expensive item.  Yeah, you have to park at the godawful PP mall to get in here. But all things considered, if the circumstances were as perfect as they were today, I'd go back happily. If chains aren't your thing, though, I'd recommend you stay the heck away."
AJ T.,"Cumberland, RI",42,92,13,2.0,12/30/2015,"Go for the cheesecake. My girlfriend received a gift card for the Cheesecake factory so we decided to have to appetizers and drinks before going to the movies at the Providence Place Mall.  The restaurant already had a line forming at 4:30 so we sat at a high top at the bar.  Our server seemed completely disinterested in us, and I was disappointed there were only 3 draft beers available, sam adams, sam adams winter, and blue moon.  So I ordered a tall blue moon and my gf got a strawberry basil margarita.  Little did I realize, upon checking some of the reviews on here, that there was a happy hour from 4-6pm, as our server never informed us, nor gave the special happy hour menu.  Whether or not this was to get us to buy items not off that menu (which are 15-30% cheaper) I don't know, but when I asked her for a happy happy hour menu she seemed confused.  Long story short, we ordered (from the happy hour specials), the beet and goat cheese salad, buffalo chicken pot-stickers, tuna tartare, and pretzel crusted chicken. My beer was flat, my girlfriend's drink sugary and lacking almost any alcohol, for 10 bucks a pop on those drinks you expect something half decent. Our food took over 30 minutes to come out to us, which I understand it's busy but these were all appetizers that didn't require much attention.  All I took away from this was a mild stomach ache. If you like the Cheesecake Factory, by all means go nuts, but for now I'll just stick to the cheesecake there (which ironically I didn't even want after going this past time)."
Keith S.,"Cranston, RI",0,9,2,4.0,8/3/2015,"Their Gift Cards Expire.  Sus tarjetas de regalo caducan ! So think twice before you buy someone a gift card as a present. If they don't use it in time, The Cheesecake Factory keeps the money."
Max P.,"Cranston, RI",0,2,5,1.0,9/18/2014,Well I always come here with my wife to eat at the bar and always order 4 to 5 items from $5 special. Food is great as always but some of the server are gross and have bad attitude like Stacey.  Sorry if I don't spend enough but it's what I want to eat. ...... Thats why I left only $2
Victoria G.,"East Providence, RI",30,196,209,4.0,1/27/2015,"Coming back the food was Amazing. So good I couldn't put my fork down , but very filling. The bread they gave in the beginning was fresh and toasted perfectly on the outside. I ordered the pizza which is cut into 10 slices and reasonably priced and filling. The dough was soft with a bit of crunch to it and just really good. Finally trying the cheesecake was just out of this world! I ordered the chocolate chip cookie dough cheesecake which includes a bottom chocolate crust layer with regular cheesecake and humongous globs of cookie dough with walnuts drizzled on top and in the cookie dough. I can't forget the whipped cream they put on the plate and on top of the cheesecake. Lastly the chocolate chips they sprinkled on each whipped cream circle. Why you may ask this is only four stars? If the food wasn't good then this would have been another one star for me. We waited 2 hours and 32 minutes to be seated. No reservations could be made on Sunday, so we took our chances and went in at 4:15 for a 5:00 dinner. They said an hour and a Half wait so we put our name down for the next available table and we went to the mall next door and looked around. Nearing the hour and a half mark we went back to the restaurant and was told another 20 minutes. Ok another 20 minutes we can live without it. There is one small booth to wait which was filled to The max with people. So we waited and waited, our feet getting tired of standing , our stomachs grumbling and then our buzzer vibrates. We arrived at that restaurant at 4:15 and was seated at almost 7:30 with the exaggeration of only 20 minutes left. This restaurant lacks severely on their waiting times , waiting area and just front organization. It was a mad house of people, squishing In everywhere waiting. In the way of other people eating , in the way of waiters and waitresses, just complete chaos. Our server was very nice though , and checked in about every 20 seconds asking for refills. So that was good. We had two servers in the beginning but one of them went on break and forgot to tell the other one of my friend's order and she got her meal while we were eating dessert. At least our other good server continued to be wonderful and asked if she wanted any bread or food to tie her over until then. One server was amazing(wish I caught her name ) , the other terrible. The waiting was horrendous , but the food was good. Will come back but never on the weekend again."
Susan L.,"Cranston, RI",0,55,,3.0,10/7/2016,I have been here many times.   The service is always been good.  Some of the meals not so good with quality and taste that's why I am giving it a 3.  If you were going there just for cheesecake it would be a 5.   Salads are a good thing to order as well as some sandwiches.  The bread they give you before the meal was also good.
Mitch K.,"Seekonk, MA",36,561,63,5.0,12/25/2014,Brought ten different slices of cheesecake to a Christmas party. It wasn't cheap ($80+) but everyone loved the variety with the slices I brought. TCF really knows how to make a good cheesecake!
Frank H.,"Attleboro, MA",0,20,,4.0,9/5/2015,My wife and I went here on a Friday evening. The place was very busy. There was a wait for tables so we decided to sit at the bar. We actually enjoy sitting at the bar when we go out. It's great for interacting with other people and bartenders. The cocktails are very good although a bit pricey. The bartenders were super friendly. They were engaged in converstaion with the entire bar. Both bartenders were highly trained and they had to be because this place is VERY BUSY. The menu is extensive and the food is very good. The location is awsome also. There's usually something going on at the waterfront and there's lots of people walking around. Great place for a date night etc. We will definitely be returning.
Citlali P.,"Providence, RI",139,1,,1.0,2/14/2016,"Horrible service. I had a birthday party dinner about 3 months ago and took almost 2 hours to get seated. Fine, we were a 6 people group. However, once we got to our table, the waiter didn't even bother to grab an extra chair in the 5person table. Moreover, once we received our order, we didn't get water refills nor any regular beverage refill until we were done with our food. Additionally, once we asked for the check, the waiter charged the group an extra 2 plates of food. IT TOOK ALMOST AN HOUR TO GET THE CHECK FIXED.  10/10 will not recommend"
Carleen P.,"North Attleborough, MA",0,17,,4.0,9/17/2016,"Great menu, location and decor. Wait staff usually terrific too. We've been many times because of their extensive menu--something for everyone! One downside: the wait during weekends or peak dinner hour."
Mike P.,"Pawtucket, RI",16,186,88,5.0,8/26/2013,"Yes, I know it's a chain, but I actually enjoy coming here. It's always super-busy, but you can't fault a restaurant for that.  I enjoy the interior with the light colored columns. It makes it seem more open and airy.  The food is a hair better than a TGIF or Not Your Average Joe's. The menu itself is huge and varied. A note to corporate- bring back your meatloaf sandwich and your chicken and biscuits. Service is generally very good.  If you want an intimate conversation or to talk business, this probably isn't the best spot as its loud. However, if you want good good and service- this is great choice."
Josh D.,"San Diego, CA",0,14,,5.0,2/27/2016,"This was my first time here and I was not disappointed. It was pricey and a looong wait time, but I think quality food is worth waiting for and paying for. That shit ain't free.  I have personally worked in the back kitchens of several cheesecake factories and they are super clean and professional. They actual have a crew come in and clean up overnight.  The bbq ranch chicken salad was the bomb. The kids pizza was on point. And of course the cheesecake was classic and delicious. I'm looking forward to going back."
Colleen M.,"Providence, RI",22,180,20,3.0,10/21/2014,"So the Cheesecake Factory is one of those places at Providence Place that I avoid like crazy. It always seems overly busy, the menu is unruly, and it's pricey. Somehow I found myself at the mall with my mom just before noontime on a weekday and it was my first choice for lunch. As I'd hoped, it wasn't too busy. I limited myself to the one page lunch menu and chose a lunch-sized salad. This was an incredible salad. It was huge, dressed perfectly, and the ingredients were fresh and tasty. I love salad but I don't usually order it in chain restaurants because they are too often overdressed or limp. Cheesecake has amazing salads. I got a slice of pumpkin cheesecake to go because I couldn't help myself. It was ok, probably not worth the $8."
Carly J.,"Providence, RI",96,7,,5.0,9/26/2015,"I went here a few days ago and had a great time. The food was good, and our waiter was very attentive. As an added bonus, I took home some fried mac and cheese balls for my roommates. They got sick and accused me of poisoning them! ha! Good times at The Cheesecake Factory though. Will come back again."
Jessica G.,"Cranston, RI",1,53,,2.0,2/12/2017,"Where do I begin with this review....tons of people on a saturday night which is understandable. However, trying to get through the mob of people while waiting. We ended up standing and waited by one of the high top tables until the people who were eating were nice enough to let us have their table when they were done eating. You basically have to fight for tables here unless you want to wait a longgggg time. So how about when they call your name and you think you have a table...you don't. You wait at the top of the stairs for them to call your name. Not a great system if you ask me....Then the wait service was slow and the food took forever to come out. The food was just average and I found it to be a bit overly salted. I think the cheesecake was the best part of the meal. The place was so noisy and crowded and clearly could not handle the large crowds of people. People were also fighting in the bathroom for stalls that actually had toilet paper as most of them did not. Was not a good experience here I get it was on a busy night and such but no customer should have to fight so hard to have dinner."
Taber M.,"Clifton Forge, VA",7,2,,1.0,6/11/2015,"Ummm two dollar signs? That's all well and good, but draft beers are 8.50 a pop. Probably 1.50 from a liquor store. Unreasonable. Service was good."
Patricia G.,"Providence, RI",189,12,1,1.0,3/7/2016,"Saturday afternoon- busy if not the busiest part of the day, I understand... I was going to be at an event within walking distance to the restaurant.  I called at 10am to see if they accept advanced dining reservations for a party of 15-20.  They said no... No problem!  We were planning on coming around 1:30pm so I asked the lady on the phone what the best course of action would be seeing as about 8-10 of the diners would be 7 year olds and I was trying to avoid a long wait.  She said call back at noon and see if there is a wait.  If there is, walk over and put our name on the list so the restaurant could prepare.  Brilliant!  No problem!  Call at noon, the gentleman says come down and get a buzzer.  Go and grab a buzzer and they say 1-2 hour wait- perfect!  Event is over in an hour!  This is terrific I'm thinking.  Go back in an hour and a half and they say if we all want to sit together it will be a 3 hour wait... WHAT?!!!!!!!  I'm sorry but when you make a reservation/ put your name in for a party of whatever number it is, don't you typically want to sit together?!!!!!!  Fine, it was Saturday afternoon but SOMEONE could've informed me one of the many times I called that morning.  If you have a large party- SKIP THE CHEESECAKE FACTORY PROVIDENCE PLACE!"
Dave B.,"Woonsocket, RI",0,7,2,4.0,2/3/2016,You go here and the wait time is too long for you try and get a seat at the bar. Always a great experience talking to the bartenders and staff and much quicker service. Great food great atmosphere and always consistent
Nadia L.,"Packard's Corner, MA",11,7,,1.0,7/6/2015,"The worst experiences I've had at a cheese cake factory. I really like this chain restaurant, however, this one was terrible.  First, after being seated we waited a while until a waitress came to great U.S.. She came around after about 10 minute saying she'll be back to take our drink order. Not a big deal. After she took our drink order an alarm and voice came over a loud speaker saying we should evacuate. The alarm went off a few times enough to annoy us. When the waitress came back with our drinks she explained what was going on and how the alarm system is connected to the mall. She then took our order. My friend was very specific in saying no onion and that he had an allergy. She acknowledge it and told him she make sure no onion. When we got our food, he had onion in his dish. They took the dish back. The waitress told him that she noted it when she sent the order in and apologized for the mix up in the kitchen. The manager came by after and apologized. We asked the manager for napkins because we all didn't have any. His dish then came as we were finishing but the napkins didn't. We had to ask twice. The manager comped the meal and apologized again. Overall it was a bad experience for us. For warning."
