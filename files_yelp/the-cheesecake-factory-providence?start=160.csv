Foodie K.,"Irvington, NY",13,230,2250,5.0,9/29/2014,"I'm writing a review for here in R.I. but have been to many in the states along the east coast from Providence, RI to West Palm Beach, FL... ALL have been consistent with their entrees. The only chain restaurant where I know what I'm getting. I've eaten so many entrees over the years, haven't pix of all of them...LOL. Never disappointed. Have been frequenting this restaurant for the last 20 years, mostly in NY, NJ, RI and FL. They serve a great Thai dish, burgers, the Sunday brunch is great. And you get the most bang for your buck. One tip when visiting any of their restaurants, if you do not want to wait any length of time for a table, head over to the bar area and the few hi-top tables where if you wait there or see people leave their spot, you're free to then take it."
Kris D.,"Providence, RI",81,264,231,3.0,3/5/2013,"The menu is just too much! It seems the few times I have been at a Cheesecake Factory the menu just gets bigger. Honestly, just stick with the cheesecakes.  The wait is also a drawback to going here. The staff was fine although I did have 2 different servers, I think my first server needed a smoke break because when she did come back towards the end of the meal she reeked of smoke, distasteful!  From now on cheesecake to go only."
Charlene F.,"Charles, Providence, RI",19,27,78,5.0,9/12/2014,Love this place. It gets busy but it's Friday night just after the mall closes and just about a 15 minute wait...not bad. Although dinner time can run ya 1hr or better so beware. Haven't had much I haven't liked from here. Cheesecakes to try are the pineapple upside down and the white chocolate raspberry and the apple pie one. I highly recommend the chicken samosa appetizer it's not spicy and no crazy weird flavor in case your not that adventurous ..you will love it trust me. ;)~
Victoria H.,"Warwick, RI",1,19,,5.0,11/15/2015,This place is awesome. Sometimes the wait can be obnoxious and their wait area could use some extra space. The menu is expansive and they are very good with your requests/modifications. Cheesecake is great as well with a flavor for everyone. Have never tried their breakfast but they serve that as well. They also serve moist towels for after the lettuce wraps. A nice touch.

Beahu C.,"Providence, RI",108,20,19,4.0,11/23/2015,Daily Lunch special is offered until 3.  My moms favorite place for her Renee chicken salad.   My sons favorite dessert spot especially the fresh strawberry cheesecake.  Great spot for a bite for lunch.
Emily H.,"Warwick, RI",72,16,4,5.0,12/22/2015,We have been to the Cheesecake Factory so many times and it has never been as good as it was tonight. It is all because of our server Lauren. I think her last initial was L as stated on the receipt. Management should recognize what an asset they have because some of their other servers are definitely lacking. They could take a few pointers from her. She was so attentive and always made sure we had what we needed. The food was great and portions were huge. Just on tonight's experience alone I would recommend this restaurant to anyone. You have Lauren to thank for that!
Craig Lee B.,"Cambridge, MA",312,15,11,5.0,8/19/2014,"I had yet another really outstanding/original Mojito Innocente variant, this time at the bar at The Cheesecake Factory in the Providence Place mall in Providence, RI on Mon 8/18, which was made with muddled blueberries, lemon wedges and mint leaves.  I have a name for it (using the standard acronyms for additive (RGB), subtractive (CMYK) and ""primary"" (RYB) colors), but the name is 2-dimensional:     C     M  RY(G)B     K Where:     C = Cyan,      M = Magenta,      R = Red,      Y = Yellow,      G = Green,      B = Blue      K = BlacK   Any suggestions about how to ""down-project"" this 2-d name onto 1-d space (i.e., a single line of characters) would be much appreciated.  TIA!"
D E.,"Manhattan, NY",0,30,2,4.0,6/9/2016,Always love this place. Has a variety of food to choose from and the service was good.
Doug R.,"Norton, MA",0,2,,1.0,12/30/2015,Overpriced mediocre food with terrible customer service.  There are better places to eat in the immediate area.
Leslie C.,"Warwick, RI",4,46,22,1.0,2/13/2015,"Cold centered meatballs in one dish the other dish soggy tortillas on fish tacos, horrible waitress leslie who double charged one dish,  never checked on our food and no drink refills"
Vanessa M.,"Providence, RI",196,3,,5.0,10/18/2015,"Never disappointed when we go to the Cheese Cake Factory. The food, service, and atmosphere are always excellent. Tonight our server Joan was awesome. She was very attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. She suggested the chicken Madeira which was fantastic. Can't wait to come back!"
Daniel W.,"Kearny, NJ",0,10,3,2.0,4/30/2016,"Food and service were good, not great, but another restaurant caught in the act. Their suggested tip is based off the total not sub-total. Stealing money from customers by doing this."
Mr R.,"Providence, RI",50,98,5,2.0,10/1/2015,"Just went there ,Our meals were so good and the desserts so good as well but our waiter was rude and was MIA for at least a half-hour!!For a chain restaurant it is okay food wise .My waiter was the reason why i'm giving a low rating. I hope they fired that kid by now!"
Kristi L.,"Concord, CA",60,227,13,3.0,12/23/2013,"Eh. I'm so just ""eh"" about the Cheesecake Factory. And it's not the fault of anyone at this particular location. It's just hard for me to rave about such unravable food. I will say this location is very clean and the service is prompt. Unfortunate, however, that they do not take reservations, particularly as they are located within the Providence Place Mall. I have been told on a number of occasions the wait would be close to or exceed two hours. Very few places in this world are worth that kind of wait, and CF is certainly not one of them."
Milton R.,"Pawtucket, RI",0,9,9,3.0,9/1/2014,"So decided on Cheesecake Factory since we were at Providence place mall. Service was slow did get offered water or bread until I asked for both. They were out of a popular drink ""Pineapple Mojito"" didn't find out out until after I placed my order isn't this something the waitress should be aware of? Waitress didn't even suggest a different drink seriously wow! The sat us at the rear entrance I can count how many customers came in and stood lost waiting for service or to be seated, the staff was no help there was no sign directing the customers to the front if the Resturant completely horrible service! On a brighter note the food was excellent and the cheese cake was to die for"
Tina A.,"Cranston, RI",0,8,4,4.0,8/19/2015,My friend and I never been so we decided to finally use the gift cards our boss gave us. Well providence plaxe mall parking sucks. the wait was way too long. Service was mia. For first time guests atleast help us out and describe the items on the menu.  Macaroni and cheese balls were melt in your mouth amazing! Drinks average. Cheese cake was delicious! Even though we had gift cards the price was way too high. Next time I will take them macaroni and cheese balls to go
Danielle W.,"Providence, RI",137,357,16,2.0,4/3/2012,"I'm not a fan of chain restaurants.  At all.   There is always so much hype about The Cheesecake Factory, always.  ""It's so good, Danielle, you HAVE to try it."" Blah blah blah.   Admittedly, I've been to Cheesecake Factory a few times with friends who've dragged me, tooth and nail.  We'd be out shopping and they'd get hungry and begin to rave about some dish they ordered from CF and we'd end up there.  Please note - this is not by choice no matter how much I'd fight and try to reason with them. The menu is like war and peace; no word of a lie.  It's so darn confusing trying to figure out which mediocre dish to order over the other mediocre dish.  I could spend an hour just looking at the menu. I've never had a stellar experience at CF; service is horrible and there is ALWAYS a wait.  Why?  I don't get it.  Drag ass a mile up to Federal Hill and actually eat some good food.  The food is greasy and weighed down, the portions are too large for any normal human being to ingest in one sitting.   BUT.  The cheesecake?  It's actually pretty darn good.  The Oreo cheesecake especially, although; you put an Oreo in anything and it'll taste phenom."
Yo K.,"Old Lyme, CT",50,84,167,5.0,5/26/2014,"Great meal and service! Sat by the bar on a sunny afternoon, lots to see.  Skinny shrimp tacos were delicious, especially with added jalapeños and sriracha sauce on the side.  The skinnylicious menu is very extensive for those of us looking to stay within moderate calorie consumption!  The mango key lime cheesecake also a great choice if you do not mind the flaky coconut texture."
Paul R.,"Warwick, RI",32,8,5,4.0,7/25/2015,"Louisiana Chicken I order it majority of time I visit ,its a tad spicy but really really good ..big size portion...the stuffed mushrooms are delicious too...as everybody already knows the place is a little expensive and wait times can be crazy"
