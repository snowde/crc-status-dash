Lee C.,"Manhattan, NY",44,5,1,1.0,10/23/2015,"ordered onion rings...$5.95 for 5, maybe 6 small onion rings...I thought it was half an order...then I got the shepherd's pie which was greasy and not worth $15.50...the cheesecake was good...the food was lousy"
Mark F.,"Providence, RI",0,3,,2.0,12/25/2015,"I absolutely LOVE Chicken Bellagio.  However, to pay $10 for a somewhat small and weak house margarita with a lot of ice is highway robbery.  A local chain restaurant not far away has excellent house margaritas for $3!  Large glass and you can actually taste the tequila.  $10--ridiculous!"
Jamie W.,"Jamaica Plain, MA",6,47,15,3.0,3/17/2015,"Returned and had the kale salad and the herb crusted salmon. No space for desert. Kale salad was a good size and tasty. Salmon was tender and tasty and large. This place serves big portions by my standards. Service was a lot better this time, not pushy but polite and not rushed.  Food came out in a timely manner.  Setting was nice. Go for a booth on the elevated level which has more privacy.  Price, about $30 per person for appetizer and entre including taxes and tip. Safe, not adventurous menu options."
Steven P.,"Chepachet, RI",102,122,,5.0,2/26/2015,"It was my first visit to any Cheesecake Factory restaurant and must admit it was a terrific experience. From the Spinach and Cheese dip appetizer bursting with tasty and tender artichoke hearts, all the way to our one-of-a-kind signature cheesecake dessert selections (Kahlua!), we were impressed. Somewhere in the middle, I feasted upon beautifully prepared Steak Diane medallions as my wife battled a monstrous and delicious Burrito Grande, much of which shared the ride home with us. The atmosphere is attractive and tastefully backlit, but the dining room feels squeezed and is fairly noisy. Yet even on a Friday evening before Valentine's Day, the staff hustled us in without a wait and provided impeccable service."
Jody S.,"Sacramento, CA",9,1326,,4.0,8/1/2015,C'mon its The Cheesecake Factory so its four stars heck they are open on some holidays too plus its pretty big with a big menu - I like chicken romano.
Erica O.,"Providence, RI",19,14,4,3.0,3/23/2014,"My experience at the ccf today was very disappointing....I was hoping to be blown away by the delicious food. But instead I got mediocre tacos that seemed tasteless and cold...no complaints about the chicken salad tostadas though, but still not mind blowned...it was super packed as usual, seemed a bit overpriced and noisy as fuck..service was good...mallparking garage was full and also had to pay which made my experience even more annoying... ive been to ccf in Braintree about 2 years ago and it was unbelievably awesome...maybe my next visit to this ccf will be better...ill be sure someone else treats me though.. 3 out of 5 stars thanks to the tostadas,lighting, couple hot waiters. And oh yeah godiva cheesecake was bomb!"
Karina S.,"Rehoboth, MA",0,3,,4.0,3/30/2016,The food was good and the service was great too. The lunch size portions are huge. The silverware was a bit dirty by the glasses were clean and so was the table and surroundings. I would definitely go back.
Eliane R.,"Providence, RI",32,3,,5.0,6/5/2015,I love that place every time i goo to get bunch of different orders i will be full from that brown bread with the butter yummy its really good
Sohini R.,"Providence, RI",71,227,11,4.0,3/26/2013,"In a recent issue of Bon Appetit, Momofuku's David Chang picked the Cheesecake Factory as one of America's Top 20 Restaurants:  ""Cheesecake Factory. Seriously. They consistently make more people happy than any other restaurant. We can all learn a lot from them.""  And CF was used by Dr. Atul Gawande in a New Yorker article as an example of consistently executing a complicated procedure. Their endorsements are spot-on.  I had forgotten how pleasurable an evening at the Cheesecake Factory can be; I used to go there a lot in graduate school, but hadn't since.  I chose CF as the spot for our first dinner out with our new baby (3 weeks old at the time).  I figured we'd get to sit down at a place with a menu, which would feel really nice after this transition to having a newborn. It was a great night, with solid entrees and very courteous waitstaff.  Sure, the menu is huge and feels like a test sometimes, but there's something for everyone.  We had a great booth and there was just enough noise to cover a fussing baby, but so that my husband and I could have conversations that weren't just about bottles. My only complaint:  no changing table in the men's room.  Come on, Cheesecake Factory, give moms a break!"
Stephanie D.,"Providence, RI",38,97,156,4.0,2/22/2013,"Came here on Valentine's Day. I have never ever EVER seen the Cheesecake Factory so packed in my life! There was a line going out the door and the steps inside the restaurant were so packed you couldn't get by anyone. I knew it would be pointless to try to get food so I ordered some cheesecake to go. I got dulce de leche, oreo, and banana cream. Despite being packed, the staff was quick & wrapped everything up pretty nicely."
Keyana G.,"Woonsocket, RI",0,27,12,1.0,7/17/2015,"Ruined my 21st birthday! I had a reservation for 15 people made three weeks in advance. It was a party of family members travelling as far as New Hamshire for my birthday. It was 11:45 am when I arrived for my 12:00 reservation, traffic was horrible due to April construction and there was practically no parking. The restaurant was empty. I went and told the host that I arrived for my reservation, she said, ""Actually they already checked in but we can't seat you until everyone is here."" I turn around and see six of my party over in the waiting area. So half of my party is already here (since my boyfriend and I arriving makes eight people) and they won't even seat us? I sat down with them and my seven year old brother and one year old sister are getting restless since there is nothing for them to do and we wait for the rest of the party to get here. My grandparents call me and say they are parked but can't find the restaurant because it's a hike from the garage, and while I'm on the phone with them the hostess comes back over and says that she can only hold the table until 12:05. So I turn to her and say, ""You are going to turn away a reservation for a party of 15 for not being here within five minutes of the reservation? In what universe does 15 people arrive at a place within five minutes of each other?"". She explains it's ""house policy."" In every restaurant we've been to, reservations are held for a courtesy of 15 minutes. My boyfriend gets off the phone with the remainder of our party, which traveled in together, and said they were walking over as we speak, and the hosts are already dismantling the table (it's 12:01!). At 12:07 everyone is here and our table was dismantled, the restaurant was STILL empty, and 15 angry people walked out of the restaurant and down the street to another more conveinent location for Saturday lunch. Really poor service and no care to understanding how to run a business."
Jenn M.,"Somerset, MA",5,19,7,1.0,2/11/2013,"Went there on a Saturday night around 7 with a group of 4 and was told the wait would be about an hour. The place was packed and all tables were full. An hour and a half and three rounds of drinks go by and we are still waiting to be seated at 8:30. The best part is, by this time, there were open tables available. We complained to the staff and all they could do was offer an apology.  The food was just as expected--mediocre. Despite the large menu selection, all of the food is overpriced, over portioned and overrated.  Providence is home to so many excellent restaurants--save your time and money and go elsewhere!"
Amy G.,"Acushnet, MA",7,37,22,5.0,1/18/2015,Visited this location after a show at a local theater - and we were looking to have a quick bite so we could get back home to relieve the babysitter.  Unfortunately we had a 30min wait - but seeing the bakery area where they display all those Devine cheesecakes - we held on. First and foremost our waiter was fantastic - we let him know we were running short on time - and he worked his magic with getting bread and drinks on our table in a flash. I know that this sounds too good to be true - but we got our meals within 10 min of order - I was shocked!  I ordered the Asian lettuce wraps and I was more than pleased (ordered a light dinner as I knew that trying some of their legendary cheesecake was in my definite future). The chicken was grilled perfectly and coated in a delicious  sauce. The Bibb lettuce was crisp and held the ingredients well. The two sauces they offered were a great compliment to the dish. My husband ordered a bacon cheeseburger with fries and he actually commented that they cooked it the way he ordered it - amazing as he hasn't had that happen in a long time. Due to the rapid disappearance of his burger I noted he was enjoying it - one thing that really impressed me was the thick cut bacon they used (not that thin crappy kind you get at other places). The waiter was so attentive to our need to scoot outta there - he gave us our bill without prompting and delivered two ice teas in take out cups for our ride home. I could have hugged this guy he was so good. Now we had pre-planned that dessert was going to happen but we needed it packed - so when we got home (and our stomachs had settled) we got to enjoy the real star of the night. Godiva chocolate cheesecake and Tiramisu cheesecake - it was so rich you just can't finish the slice. They prepare the take home slices with the sauces and whip cream so they do not spare the details - which makes this dessert a must try!!!
Rose B.,"Providence, RI",6,19,23,5.0,9/20/2014,"I've never had a bad experience at that  place. The bread was amazing, my entree was great rice with black beans, shrimp and sweet plantains. The decor of course was marvelous and our waitress was over the top friendly actually to friendly. She came every 5 mins to ask if everything was going great and I'm not exaggerating either"
Anita D.,"Cranston, RI",199,147,212,4.0,11/20/2010,"This place ranks as the King of all chain restaurants.  If anyone dares to argue that, I have 14 pages of scrumdiddlyumptious menu items to prove otherwise.  The difficulty of going to CCF is that I'm torn between getting something I know and love or trying something new and exciting. I left out a star because you really need to go during off-peak hours or else you are waiting a long time in a small space. Bar area seating is first come/first serve, but its like a hunting scene out of Discovery Channel...groups of people eyeing that ONE dirty table, and the people at that particular table seem like they will never leave.  Once they finally do, its a matter of who gets there first... Also, ask for a booth, even if its an extra wait, it is worth the personal space. Nothing like New York bistro style dining...WHEN YOU'RE IN NEW YORK.   Here are a list of items that I've had: *small plates & snacks/appetizers* -edamame- perfectly salted, always plump -ahi tartare- yummy, just a bit on the salty side -mini corn dogs- mmmm good -thai lettuce wraps- dont be fooled, in all its deliciousness, NOT low cal or low fat. -buffalo blasts- think crab rangoon, but filled w/cheesy buffalo chicken. -spicy ahi tempura roll- pretty good, t the 1st choice -avocado eggrolls- makes the Chilis southwestern eggrolls look like cheap freezer food....oh wait, THEY ARE *pizzas* -they're all good, get one w/a side salad. *burgers* -factory burger- my favorite one! My man likes the classic burger.  *specialties* -fish tacos- very tasty, beware of fried tortillas, so good they're bad -bang bang chicken & shrimp- think Thai food, spicy coconut based curry, veggies & rice. Love it, one of my favorites! *pastas* -louisiana chicken pasta- spicy, cajun & good. Fried chicken too greasy for my liking -evelyns favorite pasta- fantastic vegetarian medley, tossed in light olive oil -garlic noodles- one of my favorites, should be served w/a pack of gum *seafood* -miso salmon- my ALL TIME favorite dish. Its the perfect glazed salmon w/a creamy miso sauce, pea pods & rice.  *salads* -caeser- best one I've had, I like the bite from the imense amount of garlic in the dressing. Also need a pack of gum -chicken tostada salad- fabulous, if you like mexican  -weight management asian chicken salad- suprisingly delicious! I would definitely get this again *a list of my favorite cheesecakes* -reese's peanute butter chocolate  -lemon raspberry -pineapple upside down                  -dutch apple caramel -chocolate chip cookie dough         -pumpkin -snickers bar                                   -oreo The Lemoncello cream torte is light and fluffy if you want to stay away from the heavy cheesecakes. I had breakfast there a couple of times and the omelettes were very good.  My favorite was the eggs benedict florentine w/spincah, bacon & grilled tomato. Drinks, well all I can say is the Ultimate Margarita is worth the price and gets you where you need to be. Strong, not like the crappy juice ones that you get anywhere else! Beware, margaritas tend to be high in calories (500+) All in all, if you want to save money, go around lunch time. You ALWAYS get a heaping of food, but they have lunch portions available, I cant tell the difference either way.  You are more than likely going to take home the rest of your meal, unless you have a tapeworm problem or are training for the olympics. If you are not a leftover type of person, share your meal with someone. Either way, good food for a good price.  The 14 page menu can be confusing, but get a drink, nibble on their yummy bread and take your time."
Mina K.,"Johnston, RI",0,6,,4.0,1/31/2016,The bread is really good when it's fresh. Sometimes the wait is crazy long but it's only because it's a good restaurant. The menu and serving sizes are huge which is a plus
Mark H.,"Raleigh, NC",2,25,1,2.0,1/24/2015,"As always the food is delicious. The cheesecakes were phenomenal and the drinks were cold. However, the service was bad enough to make me rethink coming back here again. The waiter first of all I couldn't tell if he was drunk or just got done smoking a joint. He gets right in your face and smells like a week old cigarette. So if your waiters name is Wilson I do suggest just leaving because he will never ask you if you need a refill and you'll be there all night wondering where he is. If it weren't for him I would rate it 5 stars."
Ettya F.,"Boston, MA",307,701,206,5.0,10/14/2012,"Chain me up, tie me down and serve me some of the Cheesecake Factory. Yeah sure, its namesake slices are adventurous and perfect (that Oreo extreme cake they have going on literally tastes like a giant Oreo cookie), but there are other stars at the Factory. The mushroom flatbread is on par with any sophisticated, pretentious flatbread served at one of those tapas restaurants. The dough is flat. The cheese is cooked just enough, and the mushrooms are bountiful. With a drizzle of truffle oil, these mini pizzas are wonderful appetizers not to be shared. You'll probably need two for a complete meal...or three, in case you need to offset that inevitable insulin rush from polishing off your Oreo cheesecake and part of a ""shared"" red velvet cheesecake for the table."
Judy B.,"Cumberland, RI",1,2,,1.0,7/23/2015,Ordered a skinnylicious turkey & avocado sandwich for take out. Got home & there's no avocado nor bacon on it & the bread is stale & hard as rock. Also ordered sweet potatoe fries which were cold even tho I arrived within 10 mins of placing order.
Elizabeth G.,"Warwick, RI",5,70,6,4.0,12/25/2014,"It's the cheesecake factory, I think my review is useless bc everyone knows what it is, great food and huge portions at decent prices... Unfortunately, long waits and large crowds. Probably the biggest menu you'll ever encounter in your life."
