W S.,"Providence, RI",0,5,,1.0,2/11/2014,"Arrived on a Sunday afternoon at 3:30 for a late lunch and was seated within 5 minutes just as the hostess said, Which was surprising as the place was packed and numerous folks standing around waiting for tables.  We were greeted promptly and given bread and butter along with our one water and club soda.  Placed our order for a chicken sandwich and white chicken chili. Our sever came along to let us know of a shift change and introduced us to our new server.  He offered more bread and a refill on our drinks which we declined. It's now going on 40 minutes since we've placed our order.  Our original server was still in the area and I asked her why she was still here.  She replied that she can't leave until all her pending orders are served.  She told us she would go check on our order.  Our new server came along again and said he just checked and found that the sandwich was ready but there seemed to be a problem with the chili. From my experience, chili, along with soup are items already prepared and just waiting to get bowled up. Along comes the manager who begins the conversation with ""your food will be out shortly"".  Not an apology, no offer to get us something while we continue to wait.  We commented that it had been 45 minutes since we ordered and he appears to get all defensive as if we just insulted him personally. He walks away and still 5 more minutes pass when the new server comes along again with no food.  We tell him we are not willing to wait any longer and to get our check.  He says he will be right back with it.  I couldn't believe he was actually going to bring us a check for club soda.  We threw a $5 on the table and left, never to return."
Brittany B.,"Great Neck, NY",63,11,5,5.0,11/8/2015,"Was seated right away. Then again, came in for brunch on a Sunday. Currently staying at the Omni Hotel, so this was fairly convenient (after you figure the maze of the mall that connects the two together). Ordered orange juice (with pulp), which the waitor informed me right away that since there are no free refills, he will be bring me water as well. Ordered a grilled chicken and avocado club with fries. It's a weird combo, but brunch to a New Yorker like me. Anyway, the club came back with well toasted bread and fresh ingredients. Was surprised that the bacon wasn't dry because usually whenever you order something like this that happens to have bacon, you get something that tastes like it came out the microwave. The fries were decent; at least they were salted well. They gave me a lot of french fries, so I ended up not finishing them. Ordered the pecan Turtles cheesecake to go, and absolutely loved it. I'm a fan of the original candy, of course. The bill came quickly and I wasn't frustrated with the bill. Walked back to my hotel room with my cheesecake to go, happy."
Esther C.,"Marina del Rey, CA",138,184,129,4.0,11/11/2012,Great for the average college kid. Used to come here all the time on weekends for 1 serving of dinner that fed me through late Friday night to early Sunday morning. Love their cheesecake.... OMG... so delicious... ugh so bad for my hips.
Erica C.,"North Providence, RI",106,118,37,2.0,5/27/2014,"Usually solid.  EXCEPT I hate their cheesecake. My chicken chili last night though? 12.95. I would be fine with it but for the first time in the history of the cheesecake factory the portion was small. For that amount I want a huge portion with more then a teaspoon of rice on top. Humongous bowl, I guess was supposed to make a cup of chili look larger? I was actually hungry afterward. A cheesecake factor first."
Jamie D.,"Attleboro, MA",58,80,35,4.0,1/8/2014,"I love the new skinnylicious menu!! I was able to get awesome mahi mahi with brown rice under 500 calories! great portion size too! my sangria was also on the skinnilicious menu and it was perfectly sweetened. The menu enables you to splurge on the cheesecake (in my case the reeses peanut butter cup). The waiter was highly attentive, and superb. Look, you will always have a long wait here BUT you are guaranteed high energy with a fully packed restaurant. Just put your name in before you go shopping! I had stayed away from this place because the portions were always large and there weren't any healthy options...but they have certainly won me over with this new menu!!"
mike r.,"Buzzards Bay, MA",53,474,32,3.0,1/9/2014,"I have no idea why this chain is so popular or is so crowded. Basically a Not Your Average Joe's, 99, Papa Razzi etc... with a bit more bling. Priced like an upscale steakhouse with Pizzeria Uno food (not saying its bad, just you are paying for the décor and vibe). A good choice if stranded in a Midwestern airport."
Joanna R.,"Washington, DC",91,171,,2.0,8/29/2011,"This is definitely an example of how local, authentic food in Providence triumphs over commercialized, chain restaurants.  A friend was visiting from out of town so we stopped at the Cheesecake Factory for dessert before checking out a movie at the mall. We were seated immediately (I was shocked because normally the wait is at least 20 minutes). The service was fine, nothing exceptional but not horrible. The cheesecake- we both tried two of the more simple offerings, vanilla bean and dulce de leche. Both were delicious and the portions, like everything at Cheesecake Factory, were massive. The waiter recommended that I get coffee ice cream with the vanilla bean (very nice accompaniment) and an espresso martini.  This is where the two star rating comes in. The ice cream was an additional $3, probably didn't need it with all the whipped cream that comes with the cheesecake. My biggest gripe is with the martini. Unlike everything else served at the restaurant, the martini was served in a smaller than normal glass (without the shaker to refill the glass). While we were eating it was OK, but definitely something I wasn't going to order again. It tasted like the bartender used instant coffee and insane amounts of sugar, the amount where you feel like your teeth are going to fall out. The bill arrived and I was shocked to see the price of the martini- $12! One, this isn't NYC. Two, the quality and size were really should have placed it in the $7-8 range. I was insulted that they charged $12 for such a poorly made drink. I know that the Cheesecake Factory is not known for having a hopping bar scene; I just thought that I would receive something a little more interesting.  Overall, the Cheesecake Factory is like a faux designer bag trying to pass itself off as the real thing. It looks good, but not worth any substantial value."
Mitch M.,"Fall River, MA",16,20,2,3.0,2/20/2012,"As I am really against chain restaurants, this was hard for me... but I can't find much wrong with the Cheesecake Factory.  The wait is ridiculous.  The drink prices are ridiculous. But, as I regretfully say this, the food is damn good. Cheesecake factory is a-ok in my book. Minus the wait. It really is ridiculous."
Mel G.,"Tucson, AZ",131,1891,,4.0,6/10/2012,"Your typical Cheesecake Factory -- nestled within the mall of Providence Place.  Centrally located, pasta carbonara was good!"
NiNi M.,"North Providence, RI",54,34,18,3.0,3/23/2012,"Oh Cheesecake Factory... another love hate relationship... I want to love you but I can't get over the fact that every time I go there is something wrong with someone's meal and I've never had GREAT service, ever! I always order one of three things and it's inevitable that there is always something MISSING from my dish! When the food is good, it's REALLY good but the prices, on a whole, are very high for what you get. But i'm sure most of the cost is for the ""ambiance"" and ""experience"" of the establishment.  I live close by so I tend not to go when I know it's going to be busy because I don't have the patience to wait, there are plenty of other restaurants to go to instead of waiting so long, it IS Providence after all...  My three favorite meals are: Thai Chicken Pasta - always delicious, moist chicken, great sauce Corn Tamales - great taste, rich & creamy, burst of flavors Grilled Chicken Tostada Salad - Fresh, flavorful, filling A pet peeve of mine is that EVERY time I order water (with lemon) I get it in a plastic glass... What, is my water not worthy of a GLASS??? I always have to ASK them to put in it a glass.. (very annoying) Treat all of your beverages equally!! I'm also not so keen on the seating arrangements they have.. I ALWAYS request a booth, I can not stand sitting at a table and have the people sitting next to you practically AT your table..  On occasion I like to treat myself and stop in for a cheesecake to go! The cheesecake is very rich. Some people like it some don't.. Personally, it's good.. I've had better, I've had worse.. but they do have a very large selection! Until we eat again.. NiNi M."
Dan H.,"Boston, MA",85,14,7,3.0,1/27/2013,"I've visited this restaurant numerous times, and every visit seems to be an okay experience. This restaurant is located in downtown Providence, connected to the Providence Shopping Center, Prov Place Mall. Parking is inside the garage and the good thing about that is that there is a door to enter into the restaurant from the garage.  The Cheesecake Factory is always busy, especially on the weekends. The wait for a two person table during dinner time is usually 20-30 minutes. There is so much to choose from the menu list, and it could take hours to decide what you want to eat.  For starters (small plates) I highly suggest that you try something fun and different. I stick to Roast Pear & Blue Cheese Flatbread. For my entree, I love the BBQ Salmon. The flavor is so rich and satisfying. You can't forget to order dessert while you are here. I don't like cheesecake, but I absolutely love the Carrot Cake from here. My next visit, I will look out for the other options, but the overall experience was nothing special. Be prepared to spend about two hours+ when you dine here."
Gina L.,"Los Angeles, CA",39,45,40,3.0,7/21/2011,"This is a chain so despite what I say people are going to know what to expect food wise (all 50 pages worth)....its the service wise I can put my two cents in.  This review should be a 2 due to service but those damn avocado eggrolls and fried mac/cheese balls gets me every time so I gave this experience a 3. The food bumped it up. The thing about Providence is this.. expect that everyone in the state will be going out to eat Friday - Sunday. Thats it. Every single restaurant/take out place is going to be packed. Its like some sort of strange light has been turned on in every person in Rhode Island. GO EAT OUT. Even that Chinese place on the corner you see no one ordering from.. Friday - Sunday they are going to have business. So...fair warning.. unless you want to wait 2+ plus hours at this place to eat on a Friday-Sunday I would go earlier during the week. I went on a Wednesday night (8 pm) and I still waited almost 20 mins for a table outside (which is faster seating but those seats hurt). So my experience: It seems that they got rid of the buzzer notification to let you know that your table is ready. Why?? So the hostess screams your name with so many people around (between the bar and the cheesecake checkout area). Let me warn you to stay close to the hostess area cause you are not going to hear them. No silverware/napkins/plates. We had our apps waiting and getting cold on our table and still no one brought anything over (we had a table of 3). So we asked another waitress and she begrudgingly gave us the utensils and what about the plates I asked for? Oh hm, she dared and asked do you need plates too? I said yes, please. I don't want all of my fried mac and cheese all over my woman shelf thanks very much. Wheres the bread? Granted this wasn't a big deal until I realized every single other table had bread except us. We never got it. It's the point. Hey, I am done...?? I am that type of diner that likes to stack of the plates and the silverware for the runners to make it easier on them. Its also a sign that hey, I am done. Wanna get more money out of me and sell me some cheesecake? Well, our dishes were stacked for a good 15 minutes and our waiter kept on walking right past us. We had to flag him over. Maybe it was an off night..I keep on telling myself but nope I can recant all of the negative service experiences I've had there. So expect service to be a little off - food wise they are always on."
Lucy D.,"Nantucket, MA",41,682,41,4.0,12/24/2013,"A nice surprise! Service was very good, food was a nice surprise, better than my expectations. Ingredients were fresh, large portions and very tasty. Of course, the cheesecake was awesome! Not a good place to start a diet. We would return when in the area."
Caitlin W.,"Portland, OR",91,274,1377,4.0,4/17/2012,"I have been to many different Cheesecake Factories and this one is no different. Came in and was seated right away. The reason I enjoy it here is because they have so many choices to pick from that you can try something new every time. Plus, I love their cheesecake !"
Ronda F.,"Providence, RI",11,36,1,5.0,7/24/2012,"My husband, son and I dined here for lunch. Let's just say I am very picky and find something to complain about all the time.  This place was ON POINT!  Great service & great food. The bathrooms were very clean. our waiter was awesome and very attentive as were the other employees we encountered. The menu was HUGE and there was so much to choose from.  We started with pot stickers and tex mex eggrolls. Both were delicious and a must try.  My son ordered the childrens pizza which was HUGE for a child sized portion (which is good because he loves pizza)  I ordered a lunch portion cobb salad. It was incredible. I can't for the life of me remember what my husband ordered but he said it was really good..  reasonablly priced.  The only thing I wish was I saved room for cheesecake. But it was not to be, I was to full from over eating our tasty meal.. we will for sure be back."
A H.,"Houston, TX",9,82,,2.0,1/23/2014,"I went here in Sept of 2012 as a tourist in RI.  First of all it is located in a mall called Providence Place.  You have to pay park in their garage as there is no street parking.  The crowd in the mall was kind of shady and thug like.  There were straight up thugs hanging out in front of the mall.  Anyway, Cheesecake Factory  is a nice place to go in terms of how clean it is and the fixtures/furniture inside.  From a scale of 1 to 10 with 1 being McDonalds and 10 being a place you need reservations 6 months in advance this is a solid 6.  The music is instrumental jazz playing on a loop.  The volume was too loud for me to have a conversation with the other person at my booth at a normal volume.   The service is good; the host and waitress were friendly and welcoming.  The real problem has to do with the prices for what you get.  I ordered a grilled fish dish for $18 and my date got a pasta dish for $17.  It looked like reheated Sysco made food to me.  It was not bad but in places I go in my hometown you get made from scratch food made to order for $12.  Portions are generous and there is a lot of variety and custom combinations for everything.   If the prices were lower and more in line with what you get for what you pay it would be better.  The mall could have more police/security out in plain view to prevent incidents before they start."
Mat M.,"Brooklyn, NY",5,36,2,1.0,11/25/2013,"Total ripoff at the bar! Skimpy pours on overpriced booze.  Stopped in here while waiting for a train and decided to buy my dad a nice glass of scotch for his birthday. Bartender said they had a 12yr and 18yr old bottle of what he wanted. Warned us the 18yr was going to be $22. I said what the heck, it's his birthday - bring us 2.  The 2 shots we got would have been a weak pour if they'd been combined into 1 glass and served as 1 shot. After having had the discussion with the bartender about stepping it up a notch, I was appalled that she gave us such pathetic quantities for so much money. It was unacceptable. The only reason I didn't complain to management was that I had a train to catch.  I will never go to the bar at this joint again."
Rich M.,"Franklin, MA",7,16,2,5.0,5/15/2014,"Pasta with shrimp very good, salmon was excellent, club sandwich superb, and salad with chicken very good. Service was great 10 min wait. Well worth it!"
Holly L.,"Providence, RI",347,417,426,4.0,1/6/2012,"Yum Yum Yum! I love this place and never get here enough. The food is delicious, I haven't come across anything on menu that didn't sound appetizing. My favorite is the Romano crusted chicken with their tasty mashed potatoes and asparagus it's sooo good. Not to mention their fabulous cheesecake that is a meal in itself. Service is always friendly. The price to pay for great food is the wait time to be seated.  Either way count me in."
Erika B.,"Attleboro, MA",0,2,,3.0,6/21/2015,"The food does seem a little expensive, but the portion size is very big. The food is delicious, and the cheesecake is perfect as well. I wish they would take reservations or call ahead seating because the wait time was 50 minutes. There were no seats in the bar area either, as one family was saving two tables for the rest of their group to show up in a half hour. When we finally got a table, we got our drinks immediately so we were happy about that. The menu took a while to look at because there were so many options, which wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing, if you hadn't waited an hour to be seated. Overall, it was an alrighty experience though, and I will probably go again, earlier in the day next time to beat the crowd."
