Karen K.,"Ledyard, CT",0,8,3,5.0,5/4/2014,"This afternoon (Sunday)my husband, teen daughter, & her friend went for her birthday lunch. We had a wonderful experience all around.  The wait of 30 min was fine with the place jammed w/ people. We each loved our food: we shared a loaded potato tots appetizer, then the girls both got shepherds pie, my husband the tai chicken lettuce wraps, and I had the chicken stuffed tortillas. Everything was excellent!  We decided we would each order the same again. For  dessert we ordered 2 cheesecakes- a wh. choc rasp and a banana cream. So fine-the best anywhere. The rasp lemonade also yummy! Ya, we waited a bit longer for our entrees than we'd hoped but got our appetizer in 5 min!   The prices are a bit steep - our meal total was about $100 w/tax & tip but what we expected. The excellent & generous portions of food, friendly expert service, nice decor, and happy ambiance make this CCF a great place to eat. The girls give it a 5 and my husband and I a 4 so we end up w/ a 4-1/2. We'll be back!"
Joe M.,"Providence, RI",19,113,15,4.0,1/14/2014,I always get the same thing! Stuffed chicken tortillas are amaZing! My wife Lives the Thai lettuce wraps.
Katie P.,"South Berwick, ME",1,23,,5.0,7/5/2012,"Forgetting that July 4th means most non-chain/franchised restaurants are closed, my mom came down for a day trip visit and we opted for the Cheesecake Factory -- she had never been there before and I've always had a decent meal there. Well, this CF was the best one I've been to. I'll start with the service -- the host was very gracious, and we had a phenomenal server who offered my mom a great recommendation (she got the navajo and LOVED it). My water was always full, and everything came in a timely manner. Now the food. I was torn between using the skinnylicious menu (yes, that is right, they have an entire menu of ""healthy"" options -- everything under 590 calories for an entree -- and all delicious) or the regular menu. I opted for the skinny version of the veggie burger (which is the same veggie burger on the regular menu, sans cheese). It was not your traditional gross microwaveable patty. It had farro, brown rice, beets, and some other ingredients -- and was absolutely delightful. And healthy.  After dinner we both ordered our cheesecake. Yes, they are a bit pricier, but I'm a dessert person and it is always fantastic, so I didn't mind spending more on something I really enjoy.  While yes, the menu can be a bit daunting, there is literally something for everyone at a reasonable price. But come here if you are looking for consistency and quality food -- and any kind of cheesecake you'd like :)"
Ryan B.,"Providence, RI",4,135,3,3.0,3/8/2014,"I'm a fan of the factory and wish I could go more, the food is always in large portions and the drinks will satiate the pallet. The only thing that keeps this place from getting four stars is the fact that it is ALWAYS packed. you will always wait, and just trying to maneuver is difficult."
E B.,"Providence, RI",4,12,1,5.0,7/20/2013,"First time I ever stepped foot in the Cheesecake Factory, I never ever wanted to go back. Today I went with my mother to have a mother son date. We started our date with 2 raspberry lemonades and fried calamari.  For our entrees we decided to go with the filet mignon and orange chicken. Everything was delicious and filling! Let me tell you, I would def go back now. We did not have space for desert but we could have not left without a Oreo cheesecake.  The waitress was very nice and helpful. She didn't come to our table every 5 minutes to ask if we were ready. She gave us a fair amount of time while we decided what we wanted to order. I can not tell you how much I hate being rushed while I'm dinning out.  Overall great experience!"
Jeanine H.,"Jacksonville, FL",5,76,72,5.0,1/21/2014,This was the first cheesecake factory I ever ate it. I was visiting my sister while she was attending Johnson & Wales University. The service was good as well as the food. I love love love love their strawberry lemonade with the sugar crystals around the rim of the glass.
Sarah E.,"Warwick, RI",154,311,8,3.0,9/29/2011,"What is Cheesecake known for? Cheesecake, huge menu and large portions.  Even their lunch portions are enormous - which makes their Lunch Specials perfect for me. It's not just one lunch but two or three. The Renee's lunch special comes with a loaves of their famous bread, a huge ""cup"" of hearty soup, an enormous greens salad and a sandwich. If you're going to spend $10 on lunch, spend it here. Seriously, it's not even $2 more than Panera Bread. And it's bigger and better BY ALOT!"
Annette M.,"New York, NY",275,195,1174,4.0,9/26/2013,"Extensive menu, many flavors of cheesecake to choose from! The only downside is, unless you know what you want to eat, it may take awhile to decide!"
Susan L.,"Manhattan, NY",312,412,658,4.0,7/27/2011,"I came here awhile ago and tried the regular cheesecake. It was a bit more expensive than other cheesecake bakeries, however it was worth it. The cheesecake wasn't that creamy and it has a thin layer of sour cream on top of the cheesecake with the traditional graham crust. Definitely worth the try and I would want to go back and try the food."
Laura D.,"Coventry, RI",3,10,,1.0,4/3/2015,"Terrible experience. I work in the food business and i have never met management that handles a situation like they did at Cheesecake Factory tonight. I sat at a hightop with Rachel as my server, the food and drinks were great up until i found 3/4 inch bone in my chicken piccata. I quietly showed her, the manager did come over within minutes, asked if i wanted another of the SAME dish. I said no thank you... No free dessert was offered, and NOTHING was comped off from my bill. I paid $17 for a meal that i DIDNT EAT!!! Not to mention $5.50 for a bottle of coors light? For such a ""classy"" and ""fine dinning"" restaurant, i will never eat there again. Bones in their food that i could have chocked on? No comp? No offer for a dessert? I do understand that unfortunately these things do happen... However, thats when management needs to step in to make sure the customer is satisfied. What kind of management is running this restaurant and thinks this wasn't a big deal? You just lost customers, and if management, service, and food quality stays like this... Im sure you can expect to lose a lot more."
Ning T.,"Providence, RI",9,62,34,4.0,8/14/2011,"The food will always be the same and I like it! I love their calamari, spicy fried beef with rice and mango smoothie! We usually run out of room for dessert but I do like their strawberry short cake cake with fresh strawberries! Oh and the complimentary bread is very good!!"
Tina Z.,"Warwick, RI",51,214,2,4.0,8/20/2013,"HOLY Cheesecake.  I visited here for birthday dessert for my daughter.  I have never seen so many cheesecakes in my life!  I had no intention of getting any, but when I walked in and looked in the display, I couldn't resist.  I tried the carrot cake cheesecake and about 4 other flavors from others in my party.  WOW.  I have to say the Blueberry white chocolate knocked my socks off."
Jillian A.,"Warwick, RI",28,40,57,5.0,11/7/2014,I CANNNNOTTT wait to come back here!! Obsessed!  Even though their menu is HUGE and seriously overwhelming.. it doesn't even matter.. When the food comes out... nothing matters anymore except the amazing tastes.  Especially that of the cheesecakes.  I wish I could buy every kind.  Id probably live on it if it wasn't so bad for me ;)
Steve S.,"Stamford, CT",83,37,1,4.0,11/16/2010,"I love it and here's why: I can eat just about anything I'm thinking of, the menu is massive. The desserts are great. Usually get seating in a short time if there's a wait. The service is better than other Cheesecake factories I've been too."
Mari M.,"South Ozone Park, NY",104,26,1,5.0,7/13/2013,Came in with a large group and Nancy who i believe was a manager was so accommodating! Thanks Nancy! Our waiter was very attentive and the food was the same great Cheesecake Factory food that you expect
Brian D.,"St Petersburg, FL",25,43,95,2.0,6/13/2013,"I always know what to expect from the varied Cheesecake Factory menu, so the experience can be made by your company and customer service. Tonight we went as a group of six and waited out our 50 mins for a table on Saturday night in the bar. Eventually a high-top opened up and we had appetizers and drinks.  After being seated at our actual table, I was freezing and told the server. I don't know if I was in the draft from the door or under a vent. I asked for hot water to sip on. A manager came to tell us the air recirculates every 20 minutes and she could adjust the temperature but it would take a while to change.  Then our food came out and one meal was missing. A different manager offered our friend salad while waiting for her meal, which she declined. The meal didn't come until the other five of us were finished eating! So then the server came and offered me something in the meantime, but I suggested he offer the woman without the meal - I was the wrong person. I also verified he would be comping her meal, and he said absolutely. Then we never saw him again. He must have been embarrassed and didn't return.  Eventually, almost 15 minutes later another server came and cleared our plates and offered us dessert. By then we just wanted to leave. They missed out on additional orders of drinks and cheesecake by not serving us again.  Then they charged the woman whose meal was missing! But she didn't pay. The rest of us paid as fast as we could so we could just leave. We explained to the new server that the previous server said the late meal would be comped.  Food was tasty. Service sucked.  How do you NOT offer dessert at a place named for dessert? #cheesecakefactoryfail"
Matt L.,"Providence, RI",23,44,8,3.0,2/28/2013,"Well, it's The Cheesecake Factory--their menu is disgustingly long, their portions are disgustingly big and their staff is pretty mediocre. That being said, I assume anyone going to or having been to The Cheesecake Factory is going there exactly for one or a multitude of these reasons. I don't imagine the chefs prepare food so much as heat up elements of a meal, but the elements have always come together pretty decently for a chain restaurant. Plus the gigantic chocolate cake is pretty amazing."
Christine S.,"Providence, RI",0,18,3,5.0,5/4/2013,"I love this place so much!!!!!!!!! First, the the steak is so juicy! It tastes much much much better than most of popular steak house. Then, the use "" real"" cheese for your pasta, which means they shred a big cheese in front of you in your pasta instead of using cheap powder. The staff are so nice and willing to help. Cheese cake is not the best in my list but can be listed as the second one or third one. I will definitely go back again!"
Lindsey G.,"Los Angeles, CA",62,186,,2.0,1/27/2011,"Its the Cheesecake Factory, you pretty much know what you're going to get every time time. If you don't, then you can take your time reading through their 14 page menu. Overall, I love Cheesecake, so why the 2 stars? Well, the 2 stars is really for this particular location. I walked in to put my name in and there were two hosts at the front, both took about 5 minutes to actually help me. Once our name was put in, they estimated about 10-15 minutes which it took, and we were seated int the back of this very large restaurant. At first our waitress was fine taking our orders etc but then....poof...she just disappeared. After multiple attempts to go someone, anyone's  attention, we finally flag down a busser and she was able to fill up our drinks. That's all we wanted...too much to ask I guess. She finally came over, apologized, and was able to split our check which was nice.  So usually Cheesecake is fabulous, but this location was disappointing."
Sinan A.,"Istanbul, Turkey",2,63,8,5.0,7/20/2010,"OK, hear me out here; I'm the LAST person on Earth to give a chain restaurant more than a four-star rating. But, I really can't find a way to fault this place. I have been here for friend's birthdays, when my family was visiting and even came here on a date; twice! I seriously never had anything but great food and professional service, even like an hour before the closing time.  As you can understand, I'm pretty pro-local and anti-chain. But, today was something like my 30th time at this Cheesecake Factory and everything was simply perfect.  From their grilled salmon or chopped vegetable salad to their primavera pizza to their mushroom soup; I mean I have tried a lot of stuff here. I really don't remember a day where what I ordered was bad. I think the only incident was when I ordered something like a ""Asian Chicken Salad with Orange"" and I really didn't like it. They gladly replaced it with something else and haven't charged me for it.  I have never had a hit-or-miss here... All 30 + visits were perfect! I wish more local restaurants were like them!"
