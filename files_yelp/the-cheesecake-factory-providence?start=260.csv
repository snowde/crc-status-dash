Jeffrey H.,"Providence, RI",5,15,,5.0,4/27/2013,"Cheesecake Factory is a pretty incredible restaurant all around. I've never seen a more expansive or diverse menu, all of the food is delicious, and the service is good. The prices aren't bad either, given the quality and amount of food, and the comfortable and classy ambiance and decor. Some personal favorites are the thai lettuce wraps and sweet corn tamales. The only drawback with this place is that it can be tough to get a table on weekends since they don't take reservations and typically have over an hour wait times, but I don't think you can hold a restaurant's popularity against it."
Ana M.,"Providence, RI",0,2,,4.0,12/1/2014,"I have to say that this restaurant has an incredible service. The waitress was fantastic! The food was,of course, great as always. I thinks this place is famous not only for the food but also for the great service that you can receive."
Keif M.,"Palm City, FL",11,233,,4.0,7/28/2014,Just arrived in Providence. Sorry to say our hotel room was not yet ready. We don't like to drive in the city. So we wandered over to the Cheesecake Factory.Glad we did. Our servers name was Alicia.She was just plain great. As always food very good.Excellent Bloody Mary. Best location in their vast chain.
Paul C.,"Hendersonville, TN",29,23,,3.0,8/4/2012,"Been here multiple times and usually am satisfied, but this time? Not so much... Chicken potsticker appetizers were barely warm... Should have sent them back in hind site... In a way the menu is so huge you never know which  direction to go, went Mexican this time with the chicken enchiladas and they were OK... Service was OK, noise level seemed louder than usual... Probably will go somewhere else for dinner next time we are at the mall..."
Sean H.,"Smithfield, RI",102,21,1,2.0,8/1/2015,foood was great last night ....meals were great with alot flavor......the cheesecake of course was great. ....servce on other hand not so great .....the hostess was a little attuidey ....ill give her the benefit of the doubt it was busy and 1/2 price cheesecake day....but the waitress was ridiclously slow....take about 20-25 mins after we were seat for her to approach us again..food took about 20-25 mins to come out but again it was busy so i can let that slide....when we finish it took her 25 mins from the time we complete our meal to even take our dessert order.....then another 25-30 mins for the cheesecake to come out...again i get it was busy but come on we all know the cheesecake doesnt have to made and was already made it just needs to be sliced and plated.....seems no excuse to take that long
Michael M.,"Taunton, MA",298,366,92,2.0,3/12/2012,"I could never understand why this place gets good reviews! Overpriced food, mediocre tasting food and service thats always inconsistent! I'm only giving it 2 stars for a select few of the cheesecakes, because 85% of the other ones have no taste!"
Deirdre S.,"Pawtucket, RI",115,78,61,2.0,8/18/2012,"Excruciatingly slow service, tight quarters, and so-so food served with a side of indifference made for an abysmal dining experience.  Even the folks at the table next to us commented on how long we had been waiting for our food. Food was hit-or-miss; my macadamia encrusted fish was delish but the side of mac & cheese was a runny, mouth burning, hot mess. The hubby & I won't be back."
Tracie W.,"Carolina, RI",16,13,,5.0,7/14/2014,"My husband and I went here for dinner on July 12th for our anniversary dinner.  It was a Saturday night and a WaterFire night, so we had planned on arriving a little bit early (around 5:15) because we knew it would get busy fast.  We were told 15 minutes for a table out on the patio, and we waited about 10 for a nice seat along the sidewalk.  Our waitress was Adrienne and she was excellent.  We skipped the appetizers, but we did have bread, which was fresh and tasty.  My husband ordered the Shrimp Scampi.  It was excellent and he said the garlic was strong, but not overpowering.  I had the Orange Chicken (with white rice), which was also very good.  The sauce was just right with orange flavor, not too much, not too little.  We thought about dessert, but we were stuffed, and didn't want to overdo it.  By the time we left at about 6:40 or so, the restaurant was very busy and there were a lot of people waiting to sit.  Some reviews say that their food is overpriced.  We disagree.  We think we received two very good meals (with two sodas) for $46.  We will be back again."
Ashley A.,"New York, NY",67,40,16,5.0,9/17/2012,"I am extremely picky with the food I eat. Let's just say that no matter what you or anyone in your party are in the mood for, this place can accommodate. The menu is pages after pages long of every different plate possible. It's probably the most diverse menu I have ever come across. My favorite part about eating at the cheesecake factory is the desert- obviously. The wide variety of cheesecakes alone is overwhelming. But once you make your decision, it will most certainly live up to its expectation. The heavenly flavors will melt on your mouth immediately! Yum!"
Jess Z.,"Providence, RI",12,81,,4.0,1/9/2012,"Yay! I've never been disappointed in this place, good food, yummy cheesecake. Sometimes there is a sucky wait, but its always worth it."
Ted D.,"Elmhurst, Providence, RI",37,79,3,4.0,9/22/2012,Typical chain. Have not been disappointed. walk in for a slice of cheesecake for dessert is great. Menu tends to be overwhelming with all of the options. Fried zucchini as an app last time was something I hadn't previously seen.
Sophia F.,"Westport, MA",0,6,,5.0,6/1/2013,"Came here during a busy Saturday. Not only were we seated right when we entered, but our waitress came right to our table. Very quick service.  We ordered 4 different types of appetizers and shared between the three of us. The avocado eggrolls are a definite must, amazing! The appetizers and the small plates options were actually very large and filling. We did not even have to order an entree. We ended up taking chicken piccata to go (again AMAZING).  Now to the cheesecake. Even though we were completely stuffed, we had to try the cheesecake. I had the Red Velvet Cheesecake and was shocked by the huge size that was given to me.  Overall, this restaurant was a pleasant surprise. A new favorite."
Benjamin T.,"Providence, RI",28,10,,2.0,12/21/2012,"If you want to be treated like a number, instead of like a human being, by all means head to the Cheesecake Factory. If you enjoy being overwhelmed in a gigantic arena painted with some corporation's ideas of romantic, inoffensive decorations, head on over. If you find it entertaining to be tricked into reading advertisements while you're trying to figure out their menu, this is your place. I went with my wife and we both ordered the special, a fish dinner that was ridiculously over seasoned, I suppose with the intent of getting you to buy expensive drinks to rehydrate yourself with. The prices were reasonable, and our server tried very hard to seem happy. Yes, it's true that a big corporate chain like this has the buying power to get their ingredients cheaper than a small family restaurant, and they can afford an expensive mall location that will guarantee traffic, but do yourself a favor and seek out something a little smaller, a little more intimate, where there's some chance that you might taste something unique."
Yaocheng L.,"Charlotte, NC",56,32,132,4.0,6/11/2012,"Big portions! I almost could not eat any cheese cake after the entree~ The rule of choosing the cheese cake is the simpler it looks, the better it tastes~"
Kupkake K.,"Quincy, MA",9,78,7,4.0,4/1/2010,"The desserts are devine, as most folks know. As for dinner, it's hit and miss. I've gone many times and there's ups and downs. I think it's due to chef-in-training from Johnson & Wales.  Sometimes, the food is too salty or too over cooked.   I go after busy time so I don't have to wait and hopefully the chef will pay more attention to my order.  Most Fridays and Saturdays are the best days to go have dinner or lunch because I believe they put their best cooking staff on the busiest day.  On this specific Friday, we went to have a dinner before a movie and had the best sesame salmon steak in years!  It was cooked perfectly-moist.  The terryaki sauce was also excellent compliment to the fish.  My husband had the steak and it was cook just as he ordered medium rare and the side dishes was also very good.  Also on that day, the waiter was very attentative and friendly, just like a 5 star restuarant...I had to look around to make sure what restuarant I'm in!!  He definitely earned his big tip we left. I haven't gone back since because I want to keep the memory of this wonderful meal alive for a little longer....I would go again just because I can't enough of the desserts and pray we experience another great meal!"
Carly E.,"Providence, RI",53,73,,3.0,6/20/2012,"i've come to cheesecake factory many times especially since i lived in providence for three years! anyone that is from here, or even just has a brain knows when this place is going to be busy ex: saturday nights, waterfire night, weekends when a convention is in town etc. i came here on a monday night so i didn't have to worry about waiting. the hostess greeted us but was not very kind. she gave the standard ""hi how many?"" and nothing else beyond that. no smile no nothing. usually i believe they have a system of seating and they have one person greet and a different person seat. usually the seater will turn around while walking you to your table and ask how your day is going. etc. i like that! but that didn't happen this time. the two of us were seated at a large booth which was nice because it seemed like most people were jammed into small tables. we waited about ten minutes or so to be greeted by our server. we were greeted with a dirty plate in her hand which was nice. in the middle of her telling us the specials, another server came up to her to take the dirty plate. if that isn't a hint, i don't know what is.  something that i always look forward to at the cheesecake factory is the bread. it is always warm, soft and sweet! unfortunately our server delivered us cold, hard bread. i didn't fuss because i was more excited for my appetizer. we ordered the avocado eggrolls, a favorite of mine! this came is a reasonable amount of time and was absolutely delcious. i ordered the thai chicken pasta with no chicken and EXTRA sauce. i order this entree everytime, i don't bother looking through the 18 pages of menu items haha our server would walk by every now and then to check on our food and how we were doing, each time with a dirty plate in her hand. come on! finally we ordered the snickers cheesecake to go! how can you go to the cheesecake factory and not order cheesecake?!"
Victoria J.,"Jamaica Plain, MA",60,207,68,3.0,6/10/2009,"I went over the weekend after going to the zoo in Rhode Island. I wanted to sit outside and eat something delicious while the only concern my dear boyfriend had was that the food was to be greasy. So after fumbling around we settled on the Cheesecake Factory.  I knew they had outdoor seating and the menu is big enough that even Mr. Man Himself would be satisfied by something. We had the Buffalo Blasts to start.  The portion was ridiculously large, I think we had 7 or 8 pieces and they were quite tasty. I had the Crispy Chicken Costoletta with Shrimp Scampi which came with asparagus and mashed potatoes, the man had the Crispy Chicken Sandwich with Chipotle mayo & French fries. The plates came out and I was shocked by the portions - HUGE!!  I had four pieces of chicken cutlets on my plate. Ridiculous. Man loved his sandwich, my chicken was good but the flavors were a bit over the top.  After a few bites I was ready to doggy-bag it home. This place is decent, the menu is big enough that everyone would find something that they like and it's a fun place."
Daniel L.,"East Greenwich, RI",30,201,11,3.0,7/26/2009,"It's like smoking. . . I know I shouldn't do it, but for some reason I don't really understand fully myself, I do it once or twice a year.   We went yesterday afternoon around 5:45 pm and there was already a 45 minute wait.  Since it was a Saturday, and a Waterfire Saturday no less, I was expecting a wait (as Don F. points out, there's always a wait), but 45 minutes was a bit more than I expected for that time of day.  I also agree with Don F. in that  the bar is just stupid, with not enough room to get to the bar so you have to reach over and between the people who are ""lucky"" enough to have snagged the bar stools. The food is average, but the servings are large and the prices are quite reasonable for the amount of food you get.  We started with the factory nachos, while my fiancee had the asian chicken salad and I had the orange chicken.  Everything was cooked okay and tasted fine.  You could tell it was just chain food, though, and nothing too special, but, then again, this is to be expected from a chain restaurant, a la Chili's or Fridays.  Our server was perky and efficient, no complaints there. The cheesecake, of which they have an ungodly amount to select from, has always been good, and it was again last night.  One would hope this would be the case, though, since it's in their name. Even though I am not enamored with the bar or the wait, and the food is okay if unspectacular, for some reason, I know I will never be able to rid myself of going to some Cheesecake Factory in the future. . . just like if someone offered me a smoke somewhere down the line, I would be tempted to take it."
Georgeanne Q.,"Scituate, RI",0,24,,3.0,11/8/2012,Have only had lunch but def. recommend!  Of course the portions are HUGE!!! --great for take home!  The burger I had was perfection!
Michael P.,"Bel Air, MD",70,85,187,4.0,2/10/2012,"This is the first time I've been back to a cheesecake factory in years.... I was on a business trip and the cheesecake factory was conveniently located near the train station. I arrived with a few of my co-workers in search for some lunch... I was quite surprise at the large selection on the menu. The one thing that fell in my top category of BOMB DOT COM status was the fact CCF had a under than 500 calories menu. I ordered the hamburger with a side salad. The food fresh fresh and tasty, def look forward to having a bite at CCF."
