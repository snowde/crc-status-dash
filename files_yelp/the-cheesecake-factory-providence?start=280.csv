Erica L.,"Providence, RI",41,75,,3.0,1/17/2012,"You can tell this is a chain restaurant - overpriced but decent food. Lots of options but seems to be packed a lot. If you go on Friday or Saturday, expect to wait. It's nice that it's attached to the mall. The cheesecake is good though!"
Qili H.,"New York, NY",0,31,2,2.0,4/20/2014,Typical chain restaurant. I always love the dark colored sweet bread the waiters bring out. It's free and delicious. The food I paid for at CCF are always my usual: Cajun Jambalaya pasta and chicken bellagio pasta... Overpriced. Expected flavors. Always fulfilling to my stomach for hours after.
Chelsea F.,"Providence, RI",43,103,34,1.0,5/23/2013,"Absolutely awful. I don't dine out much, one, because I'm a server myself and find it hard not to be overly critical, and two because it's not cheap. My friend and her boyfriend and my boyfriend and I decided to go because it was her boyfriend's birthday. I was super excited, seeing as I had never been before. We were put on a 15 minute wait because it was busy--even though my friend called ahead. After 35 minutes, we were seated. It took at least 10 for our sever to come over. We ordered appetizers right away because we were all starving. The drinks took 10 minutes and were brought over by a different server, along with the appetizers. When we wanted to place our order, we basically had to drag down our server. While our appetizers were delicious, our meals weren't anything special (also served by a different server.) Mine was cold and over cooked and at that point we just wanted to leave. We couldn't even get drink refills, seeing as we hadn't seen our server since he took our orders. After someone came over and told us our server had too many tables to handle, we finally saw him and asked for boxes. When I asked, I told him it was my friends birthday. He replied with, ""oh."" and rolled his eyes. Even though they brought out dessert and sang, I did NOT want to tip 20% and I never want to return. Ew."
Jen L.,"Johnston, RI",63,170,59,3.0,5/5/2011,"The wait is terrible.  We waited 45 minutes for a table, then when we went to check on it we were told it would be another 45 minutes.  While you wait there is nowhere to sit/stand, it's so awkward.  The menu is HUGE, and the food is always good.  I got the Bang Bang chicken and shrimp.  I loved the flavor but it's one of those that is just a tad too strong and stays with you for the rest of the evening.  Our waitress was super nice and dealt with our loud drunk asses with a smile.  I always swear I won't come back on a weekend but that's always when we find ourselves there and always regret it.  The parking garage was built by drunken monkeys, but once you figure out which entrance to use it's not so bad since this is on the first floor.  Worth it just for the cheesecake alone!"
Kimberly S.,"Warwick, RI",64,247,,5.0,1/11/2012,"Who doesn't love The Cheesecake Factory? Always a good time, their menu is extensive and has something for everyone (not just cheesecake). In the summer you can dine out on the sidewalk which always makes me feel very trendy and cool :)"
Tatyana J.,"Providence, RI",0,1,,4.0,10/10/2012,"It was an amazing experience for all of us. The food was delicious and we had a fun time. Our server had a very good knowledge of the menu and was able to answer our questions. We received our food in a timely manner and everything we had ordered came out correctly.  Tatyana, Shavon and Paigton"
Nicole M.,"Swansea, MA",46,69,7,4.0,7/9/2011,"Crowds don't necessarily equal good food, but go with me on this. Yes, CF is a chain restaurant, so there's nothing terribly unique outside of their desserts. Although a crowd, we didnt wait long for a table. During out 20 min wait we saw friends in the bar area and were able to mingle there. I was not impressed with the system used to notify  you of your  table availability. The hotess yells out your name (in a very loud atmosphere). I think this is the cause of the large crowd at the entrance waiting. What ever happen to the flashing beeper technology? Or text me! Please do not scream my name across a crowded, loud restaurant.  The menu was huge and varied which was a plus for me; it seemed to have something for everyone. Our waitress was very nice, but definitely new. I would think with an anticipated crowd on a Friday night they would schedule a more experienced wait staff.  After dinner we chose to get a dessert to take home. We went to the Cheesecake bar to order. This area should be stationed away from the mob waiting to hear their name yelled. There was no distinct line formed, so people stood and just looked at one another trying to see if they were next.  I love the atmosphere and food. I think the service was fine but felt bad for the girl who was obviously new and  flustered.  I would return either on a less popular night or to stand in the chaos to get take-out cheesecake; somethings you just cant pass up! lol"
Krys A.,"Boston, MA",370,224,110,2.0,11/12/2008,"You would get an A-OK for the delicious cheesecake you serve; Over-priced for one slice. But for your awful service and long wait you get only 2 stars! And you mixed up my friends birthday cheesecake.  I (YES ME), I went to the waiter and said its my friends birthday can you make her cheesecake fancy and special and sing to her? I pointed her out and informed them of the cheesecake she ordered.... Out marches the wait staff to come happily sing happy birthday and who do they go over and sing to?!?!??!? ME!!! They decorated MYYYY cheesecake and sang to ME, looking at me putting the plate infront of me as I pushed it over to HER,... you retards!! And what is up with always the ridiculous non-sense wait?!! And yet they give you a vibrator to inform you that your table is ready but yet you can only walk about 20 feet from the hostess stand... Madness I tell you. If its going to an hour or so wait, make the vibrator thingy work within Providence Place Mall...."
Jenn S.,"Cranston, RI",2,10,4,4.0,12/26/2011,Joan was an excellent server and the food was fantastic
Amanda C.,"Brentwood, TN",343,393,87,4.0,8/31/2009,The food is like all the other CheeseCake Factory locations but one thing made the meal great.   Joshua D.  So nice and sweet!  He was very attentive and provided great service! Request him!
Giselle R.,"Jersey City, NJ",329,294,215,2.0,11/17/2008,"Why review this type of eatery? Well, sadly, sometimes even though you know before you get there it's going to be a chain-y, loud badly prepped food joint, you got no place else. Onward then. The wait is ridiculous. Really?  Everytime I see we are forced to chose between Cheesecake or say McD's  I think, well at least I can get a salad,and then they hand me that damn beeper.( Part of me thinks""F it, somebody get me a big mac"") So thirty minutes later, we're led  through the noisiest restaurant ever to a booth where a book/menu is handed you for your perusal. I've been here six or seven times and it's always the same. As a matter of fact, doesn't really matter the state, it's always formulaic.Um, hence the chain thing.   The dinner salad is gi normous.  The tea tastes like flowers picked from my yard(I live in the bronx,so yuk!) I will say, that the avocado rolls appetizers are yum.Fried. What?! There, I said it. Consistantly good. Everywhere. So, if I don't have a real choice and everyone wants to go here, I'll go, and not expect much so that when I order my chicken salad and avocado roll it'll be better than a big mac. Sorta. But not really."
Karl H.,"New York, NY",0,13,8,1.0,5/14/2013,"I wish I had the chance to eat here, we waited 90 minutes after being quoted 70 and walked out, long story short pager didn't work and the host staff doesn't look outside or at the bar for folks as a backup no matter how busy or crowded the entry gets.  When we talked to the hostess she said sorry, but we looked here (at the entrance) with a bit of an attitude.  Decided other options would be a good idea."
Vince M.,"Warwick, RI",29,23,50,4.0,3/6/2011,This place has the best of both worlds. Great entrees and awesome deserts
Cassie B.,"North Providence, RI",70,102,,2.0,3/26/2009,"I think the waiting til all are present to be seated is a stupid rule. They lost out on at least $30 worth of drink my siblings and i could have consumed while waiting for my parents. And they lost our name in the book, so our wait time was annoyingly doubled. Mojito never saw a muddle, and was barely stirred. Burger came out mooing and bleeding like a stuck..cow i guess...when i asked for Medium.  Waitress couldn't be found to fix the problems, management didnt seem to care. Cheesecake was good, and the avocado eggrolls...if not for those eggrolls we'd stop going. Damn eggrolls..."
Traci A.,"Saint Michael, MN",35,97,1,3.0,9/14/2008,"I wanted to give this place a 2.5 stars... The food is generic, crazy huge portions (who needs that much food?), the service is average and the wait is insane. Really. What's so great about this place that it takes so damn long to get a seat? I don't understand. The only real redeeming quality is...you guessed it...the cheesecake. That's why they got 3 stars from me instead of 2. But your best bet is to just go in and buy a cheesecake to go and avoid the BS."
Andy K.,"East Brunswick, NJ",376,1066,199,3.0,6/12/2008,"Love the factory! Although we were first seated next to some of the most annoying teens. Thankfully the waitress noticed them and asked us would we like to move. We took her up on that offer and moved to a quieter location. I have been to a few Cheesecake Factory locations (Boston,Westbury,Baltimore) and here. They all have the same menu since its a chain, but they give you huge portions and the cheesecakes are all delicious. If you need to go to the chain, skip the applebees and fridays...Cheesecake Factory is far better."
Rob J.,"San Diego, CA",1,182,1,2.0,10/6/2013,It's a Cheesecake Factory:  Wide selection of menu items that are usually solid (not great).  A wait that is usually entirely unreasonable and hardly worth it.  Probably the most notable thing from my visit was the bad service - these folks are robots and cannot help you while the machine is running - stay out of their way!
Brian W.,"Mystic, CT",126,44,5,4.0,8/5/2011,"I know this place is a chain.  However, I went to school in Providence and whenever I visit I try and work a trip here into the schedule.  This place is just yummy.  Big portions, huge selection."
Ryan B.,"North Haven, CT",28,145,,3.0,2/16/2009,"Whether you like it or not, this place is now a staple of the downtown area of Providence. There are plenty of other great eats around, but TCF can be fun. It is in a cool spot and is conveniently attached to the mall...so a movie after is always a nice follow-up.  The food is typically good like all their restaurants, but the wait is unbearable. You're looking at an 1 hour+ on a weekend night. If you can sneak a meal in, you won't be disappointed but you won't be blown away either and it certainly isn't worth their typical wait."
A K.,"New York, NY",12,89,1839,2.0,2/15/2011,"I was disapointed at this cheesecake factory.  I have been to the cheesecake factory many times at different locations before.  I love the food, so I do not have any problem about the food.  But I gave 2 stars because I think the service here was the worst.  I always order Chinese chicken salad, which has fried rice noodles on top.  This waiter brought the salad, I don't know he was careless or in hurry, but he dropped all fried rice noodle and small amount of salad on table and my lap.  He did not apologize at all and just said ""you will get more""  and brought the fried rice noodles. Not to mention, he did not clean the table...    I never had this kind of service before...  I really think they need to train the staff better."
