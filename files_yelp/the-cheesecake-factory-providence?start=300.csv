Nereida B.,"Edgewater, NJ",10,12,7,2.0,2/26/2011,All I have to say is ... Chain restaurant!  I had to stop here due to a scheduled meeting.  Please skip and head out to Al Forno Restaurant on South Main Street.
Martha C.,"Cranston, RI",2,89,,4.0,3/26/2013,The Cheesecake Factory is always a safe bet for a chain restaurant.  The menu is expansive and offers a little something for everyone with large portion sizes.  I always enjoy my meal!
Dani G.,"Warwick, RI",15,311,,2.0,1/9/2009,Ok so I was talked into it yet again... The service was great and I again was determined to be adventurous with hte menu to trul test the chefs' ability to accomplish the wide variety of menu options. I chose the barbecue salmon with a red mashed potato over sauteed spinach. It was a large sized portion- consistent with my past experience- however the flavor was simply so-so. My dining partner enjoyed the Cobb salad and she was pleased.
Q S.,"Somerville, MA",189,282,3,3.0,9/28/2008,"Everytime I've wanted to go to a Cheesecake Factory, there's always a 60-90 minute wait. Well, I've had it!  I went during lunch time (around 2pm).  Yay!  The wait was only 20 minutes.   I was expecting small portions from the lunch menu because most things were pretty cheap. I got the lunch size roasted veggies pizza w/ goat cheese and it came with a green salad.  I also ordered  sweetened green tea.  The tea came with mint and was kind of weird for my taste.   My companion got a chicken salad sandwich, which came with soup and salad.   When both of our meals came - it was HUGE!  My salad was in a big bowl, and my pizza was pretty generously portioned as well.  Both of us couldn't finish our meals, and we couldn't get cheesecake because we were both stuffed. The pizza was really good and the crust was chewy and crunchy."
Kate M.,"Middletown, RI",37,15,,4.0,3/26/2011,"I love this place!  The menu selection is great...even the fussiest eaters can find something they like.  They have lower fat apps and a couple of healthy low fat options, but I wouldn't go there if you are watching what you eat.  The portions sizes are huge.  My husband and I usually say we are going to split a meal and save room for cheesecake, but the food is so good we can't do it!  The brown bread is awesome too!  I could just eat that for dinner alone! The cheesecake selection is enormous.  I've tried many with my favorite being the Dulce De Leche (carmel) cheesecake.  I always feel pretty full after eating that huge meal but can ALWAYS finish my cheesecake! Its a great place to eat, but usually an hour or more wait on the weekends, so if you have time to wait...its worth it!"
James B.,"Providence, RI",35,5,,5.0,3/26/2011,Man all I could say was wow! Place was packed and lots of tables and servants! Very good service and delish food! Make sure to call ahead for a appointment. Love this Place
Aimee A.,"Los Angeles, CA",182,500,26,3.0,6/15/2008,"I'm so sick of the Cheesecake Factory's food, it's official. Everything is greasy and the portions are WAY too big for any normal person to ever eat. Plus the food just doesn't seem to be good after you bring it home and reheat. The cheesecake is great but I've learned my lesson... I will only come here for drinks and dessert from now on. If I eat a whole meal here, I know I'll just leave feeling like a fat cow, no matter what I order!"
Rorey G.,"Cranston, RI",0,14,,2.0,5/8/2011,"Long wait, Big menu, Huge let down.  It's simply not worth the effort or irritation.  Skip it."
Jack S.,"Attleboro, MA",0,3,,5.0,4/16/2011,I love this place! The menu has so much stuff it's crazy.. Adams PB cup cheesecake is the best!!
J C.,"North Dartmouth, MA",54,79,37,4.0,7/27/2010,Ok my family had never been to a Cheesecake Factory and when I told them where we were going they didn't seem interested but I dragged them there anyway.  They ended up loving it.  The pasta is amazing and great service most of the time.  The menu is almost too big but your almost guaranteed to find something to try.  A little pricey but great place to go if you haven't been.  Turns out my family thought the name sounded like it was like an Old Country Buffet.  It's pretty much the opposite of that.
Jeremy D.,"Cranston, RI",1,2,1,5.0,12/15/2010,"My favorite place to go.  Hibachi steak, chicken maderia and the steak diane are the best on the menu. Always good service and good food."
jane f.,"Providence, RI",0,20,1,1.0,6/30/2012,"It pains me to write this review as I typically in the past have always loved CF! However (dun, dun, DUN.....) tonight I went there for dinner and, as always, ordered my favorite luau salad. I thought the chicken on it tasted very salty and ""funny"" so I asked my husband to see if I was crazy. He said he tasted sauce and couldnt really tell....so instead of going with my initial thought, I ate it! And like clock work, 3 hrs later I never left the loo! That chicken was bad and I had a case of food poisoning. I wouldn't ever expect a well-oiled machine like the CF is known to be to have this happen! Needless to say, my love of the luau is now down the toilet and I will not venture back to providences CF restaurant.  :("
Shawn F.,"Washington, DC",5,65,12,3.0,8/25/2007,"I've been to a few Cheesecake Factories now, and I think the Providence one isn't too bad. I came here with a friend for dinner before going to Prov. Place for shopping and a movie (Casino Royale!), and neither the service nor the food really made any waves.  There was another time when I came here with my friend and her mother after taking a tour at Brown, and I recall having a pretty good hamburger. Overall, I don't remember anything being overwhelmingly good or bad on either of my visits ?(excluding the delicious hamburger), so I guess if you want an unobtrusive dining experience, then CF would be a good bet. Still, there are better options in Providence. Oh, and CFs don't take reservations. Be prepared to wait."
Jessica C.,"Stafford, VA",1,7,1,5.0,6/20/2012,"Yes, it's a chain and yes, the mammoth portions are not good for you. But I love this place. I always sit in the bar area which is a nice atmosphere. The food is delicious. My favorite is the incredible grilled eggplant sandwich- yum! Wait staff here is always über polite."
Sweetdreams S.,"Boston, MA",1,55,1,5.0,3/15/2010,"Yes the wait is torturous during lunch but it is worth it.  The salads are amazing, love the lunch portion sizes and the brown bread.!  The martinis are great.  Love the atmosphere.  Service is satisfactory. This is a great place to break from shopping while at Providence Place."
Linda L.,"New York, NY",83,53,90,3.0,2/12/2012,"me and my roommies came here and the first time it was a good experience the 2nd time back with a group of 25 people, it was bad. the food order kept messing up and the food came out cold and slopppy. the best part was the cheesecakes."
Elizabeth T.,"Hinsdale, IL",0,44,3,3.0,9/27/2009,"I'm not a chain restaurant fan at all,but our group couldn't agree what place to go and we went for the closest option.It was busy Sunday and I was pleasantly surprised that waiting time was only 10 min. I agree with everyone - waiting area is way TOO SMALL !!!!  you feel like standing in overcrowded bus and poking the neighbor  with you elbow..    We ordered a ""tuna tartare"" from small plates - 10 points !!!!!!!!!!! I love Asian cuisine and it's really hard to satisfy me, but this was a winner !!  next bite was a ""buffalo plate "" from appetizers menu. I regretted tasting it...It sounds completely different on the menu from how it's prepared. it was something between chopped chicken,mixed with cheese and put in some type of breading and fried after all..ew..even hot  sauce was plain Tabasco tasting,nothing special. Then it was  time for fresh grilled Mahi-Mahi and spicy crusty beef. I give it 7,5 out of ten. BIG portions thow !     Service is good as always in that type of restaurants - polite and fast. One thing - while we entering the restaurant , we saw couple of waiters puffing a smoke outside with their uniforms and aprons. I guess they were working ??? not a very satisfying view...   Will I ever go back ? Not for my own pleasure, but for a crowd with a lot of different taste -probably yes."
William L.,"Charles Town, WV",25,27,1,1.0,8/16/2010,"I've been to several Cheesecake Factory Restaurants before...this one fell far below the standard. The waitress seemed inconvenienced by our presence and further inconvenienced by any questions about the menu. She never asked us how our appetizer was, nor did she comment on us stacking the plates when we were done to help her out. It wasnt busy, especially for cheesecake factory standards. We certainly werent the only people in the restaurant either. The food was mediocre...usually its pretty awesome. When the food-runner brought us our meal, we kindly asked her for a to-go box because we knew we couldnt finish the meal....always big portions. Those to-go boxes never came; we had to ask our server for them after we finished eating. Did she say she was sorry that no one brought them out before, after we told her we previously asked for them....nope. I will say this: the busser was extremely polite; he was probably the best employee in the restaurant last night."
Bryan D.,"Oxford, MA",11,480,73,4.0,6/6/2011,"the food is good, the portions are giant but be aware that the food is the worst thing for you that you could ever eat. everything is soaked in oil and butter. if you're ok with that, then you will love it"
Steven N.,"San Jose, CA",129,222,68,4.0,1/14/2010,place is good if you are really hungry and don't mind a long wait. it is always crowded and the portions you get for everything are HUGE and kind of expensive. but overall i really like cheesecake factory not only for their cheesecake but their food in general they have a wide variety of foods.
