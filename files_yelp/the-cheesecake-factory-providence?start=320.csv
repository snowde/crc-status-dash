laurie s.,"North Attleboro, MA",8,78,,3.0,9/15/2007,Im not a big big CF lover. Its good and i do crave it every now and again. There is always a wait at this location especially when water fire is going on across the street . I have never had bad service here and the location is more convent for me but I would much rather go to the one in Boston.
