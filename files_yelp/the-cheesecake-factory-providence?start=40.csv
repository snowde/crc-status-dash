Stacy S.,"Atlanta, GA",0,167,7,3.0,7/22/2017,"Came here a couple times during happy hour to try out their $6 happy hour appetizers. I've had the Tex mex egg rolls, pot stickers and chicken sliders. Of these appetizers, I would only recommend the tex mex egg rolls. I've also had the pepperoni kids pizza which is very thin, crispy and not tasty"
Smaylin R.,"Cranston, RI",0,5,21,5.0,7/17/2017,The food was very good ans tasty.  Also I love their selection of healthiest choices.  The staff is very friendly. My husband is a picky eater ans d he love his food. I got one of  the combinations dishes delicious.
Chi P.,"Orange County, CA",65,213,1106,3.0,10/14/2016,"The location of this Cheesecake Factory is a little odd because it is kind of attached to the mall but you have to walk outside to get to it. They also don't validate mall parking. The food is the same as usual. The wait was a little long.  We were seated near the kitchen area and we could actually hear the chef yelling at the people working in the kitchen, which was a little strange. The worst part was the service inside. We waited 30 minutes for appetizers and then another 45 min for our food. Our waiter actually disappeared and we had to flag down other waiters for updates. One waiter  told me he couldn't even find our waiter! I'm not sure if he was hiding from us but he was not apologetic about the long wait. He just told us they ""were slammed"", as if that somehow made it okay. The food itself was good but I deducted a star for how long I had to starve waiting for my food."
A P.,"Smithfield, RI",0,6,,2.0,3/24/2017,"Here is the Cheesecake Factory response to why they have decided to recommend that guest tip on tax  Thank  you for providing your feedback regarding our suggested gratuity guidelines that are calculated on the post-tax check total. It was a decision by our company executives to use this figure and we do so in all of our restaurants nationwide. Prior to printing a suggested guideline on our checks, we did review different restaurants in the high casual dining segment and found that the practice was mixed. Some were calculating pre-tax and some, post-tax.   I am sorry that this decision has disappointed you, and will share your feedback with our company executives. We appreciate feedback from our guests and often use it to shape future decisions. Sincerely, John Marotta Guest Services Specialists Cheesecake Factory Customers Say They Were Duped Into Leaving Big Tips"
Iris S.,"Providence, RI",244,194,247,3.0,3/22/2017,"stopped here for a quick bite before going to the movies cheesecake factory has definitely stepped up their game with ""healthier"" options.  My gf and I ordered on the skinnilicious menu we got lettuce wraps (3 large bibb lettuce, filled with tender grilled chicken, shittake mushroom, red cabbage, and cucumber) that came with a chutney (way too sweet) and a spicy peanut sauce (which was delicious we also got the summer rolls (vegetarian- asparagus, sesame noodle instead of the traditional vermacelli, cucumber and carrot) also had two asian inspired dipping sauces. I still stuck to the spicy peanut sauce. while not authentic in any way, still extremely tasty.  we opted not to order more so we could get a jumbo extra buttered popcorn later!"
Ayushi A.,"Plano, TX",393,81,13,4.0,2/11/2016,"One thing thats awesome about the Cheescake factory is how extensive their menu is. For those that don't like too many choices this may be overwhelming but I personally love it.  So in breakdown by dishes:  Skinnylicious Tuscan Chicken: The dish was gigantic so if you're going hungry and considering this it will not do you wrong. The sauce soaked in the tomatoes and the farro was mouthwatering. I absolutely devoured the tomatoes. However, the chicken itself was not cooked that well and was very hard to break it off. It also didn't really have a taste which was surprising because you would have hoped that the sauce soaked into it. I think there are better things on the menu.  GET THE WHITE CHOCOLATE CARAMEL MACADAMIA NUT CHEESECAKE:So the group I was with for the most part we were all trying to be healthy but this was something we could not resist. The nuts are a perfect compliment to the smoothness that is cheesecake and every bite only left you wanting more. I love white chocolate so perhaps I may be biased but 4/4 of us said we would order it again.  Key Lime Cheesecake: THis didn't hit the home run quite so much. It definitely was strong in the key lime flavor so don't expect anything else. But I personally dont enjoy cheesecakes that are fruity based because I am looking for chocolate.   The Cheesecake factory has the best stuff in its name - dont go without getting dessert."
Johnny S.,"Town of South Kingstown, South Kingstown, RI",201,67,168,3.0,7/12/2017,"This location has been here for quite some time,  and I've been several times before today (first few years when they first opened). Over the years I've stayed away from the run of the mill cooperate chain restaurants. Although they do have one hell of a menu, a nightmare for servers and bartenders I'm sure (since I am one I can relate), I've noticed a steady decline in details. One example,  the table we were sat at was not wiped down. Not even an attempt to wipe it down was made. It was sticky to the touch and covered in what looked like some sort of kosher salt. Perhaps from a pretzel app or margarita glass. There was salt all over the table. It wasn't busy when we came in for lunch. The waitress was friendly. I asked her to choose between two pasta dishes for me and she nailed it. I would have given less stars but she brought up my rating. I think I'll stick to Federal Hill for my pasta cravings."
Marc S.,"Worcester, MA",38,7,2,1.0,6/26/2017,"I can't for the life of me fathom why people frequent this restaurant with such ardent fervor. It. Is. Terrible. The worst. All around.  First and foremost, the service is beyond terrible. The servers are plain rude. My wife called to make a reservation. The first server told her they couldn't take reservations until 12:30 and hung up. When she called back, a different server told her they don't even take reservations. They aren't any nicer in the restaurant. They ignore you while you're waiting. Once we were finally seated, they barely came around. We were there two hours. No wonder the line is so long.  Second, their food is nothing to write home about. My eggplant parmigiana was cold and was on par with Olive Garden. My wife's chicken and avocado salad was so bland and unimaginative that it's hardly worth mentioning.  And I can't stress this enough: the cheesecake is not that good. Seriously. If you're from Boston or Providence, go anywhere else and it will be better (and less expensive).  My parents love this place but to me it's overpriced and overrated. Go to any other Italian restaurant in Providence (Pano e Vino for example) and you'll be much more satisfied."
Ramesh A.,"Terre Haute, IN",15,42,221,1.0,6/28/2017,"Ever been to a place and feel like you shouldn't come back again. That's this cheese cake factory location in Providence. Right in the downtown occupying prime real estate. What a waste of my time for choosing the worst customer service ever. This incident happened last night 06/23/2017. It started with me and my friends waiting for 5 mins to 10 minutes to be noticed by a receptionist . There was no one at the reservation table. After asking a guy who was adjusting the menu, he helped us out and got us seated in 10 mins which was a pretty quick service.  There comes our waiter- tries his best to show off with his specials menu and then asks for a drink. Once the drinks are placed he hurries us for the order, at that point my friends and I order appetizers and were in no mood for entree. The guy gives this nasty look which my friend feels offended . I brushed it off saying he  probably didn't mean anything. Once we were in the middle of our appetizers he comes back and asks for anything else. At that point I ask him for dessert recommendations. He points at the menu on the table next to me and says give me the menu. I was taken back and offended by way he asked (rude and demanding) and when I asked him dessert recommendations again, he repeats three times to give him the menu on the table . There was no please or may I have the menu please?. At that point I was furious after handing him the menu and he turns to the picture on the menu and says I wanted to show this. This is all in his condescending, arrogant attitude. I wasn't sure what his problem was, I am not sure if it was because we were brown skin ( this is the first time ever I had encountered this kind of incident ever) . I didn't want to confront him for his behavior , I politely asked him to call his manager. By the way the waiter name is Anthony.  Manager showed up and said he was sorry on behalf of the waiter . I asked for a different waiter/waitress which he did. (the new waitress was courteous and professional and even apologized at the end for his colleagues behavior) .I asked the manager if there is going to be any follow up about what action he will be taking, he didn't have an answer. I insisted I would like to know and I will be posting a review on yelp for response. Manager told me I could post one but he can't answer to it .  I am not sure what policies does cheese cake factory has to deal with this kind of behavior by one of their staff members. The manager did try his part to be professional, but had no information for further response. I would definitely like to know and let others know how we won't tolerate this behavior."
Coral P.,"Little Compton, RI",0,1,,5.0,11/7/2017,My boyfriend and I went here for my birthday on Saturday night and roughly waited around an hour. We parked in the north parking garage level 2 and it was an easy walk. I ordered the cajun jambalaya pasta which was very yummy and even better for leftovers (spicy). I got the seasonal pumpkin cheesecake that was absolutely delicious!
Allison Y.,"Markham, Canada",184,869,2395,3.0,7/4/2015,"I have heard many faves about The Cheesecake Factory.  I was looking forward to this first encounter.  I admit that I was let down.  It is rather easy for me to summarize the impression I have of The Cheesecake Factory in Providence. Pro: Nice decoration Professional and friendly wait staff Large portion Reasonable price as per portion and decor Fresh ingredients Delicious cheesecake Con: Cutting corners/steps in cooking The BBQ Pork Sandwich was noted in menu as using pulled pork.  The product contained chunks of pork, none pulled into stripes.  The flavour didn't infused inside the pork chunks.  This shortcoming would not have been noticeable should someone have pulled the pork into stripes.  Having said that, the burger was delicious (thumb up to the sauce) if this was a BBQ Pork Chunk Sandwich.  My suggestion is to either pull the pork as described in the menu description, or change the menu description into ""chunks of pork"".  I never expected fish tacos to be authentic in Rhode Island.  What I expected was something that looked like fish tacos and tasted good.  The fish tacos looked okay and came in double corn tortillas.  The white fish strips were chunky and fresh enough.  Unfortunately, the double corn tortillas were completely cold and half stiff.  This indicated that they were not kept warm and moist, or at least not re-hydrated and warmed up before use.  The best way I can describe how unenjoyable these tacos were is to imagine someone serves a hamburger in cold and half hardened buns.   The accompanied bean and rice were not refried beans and Mexican rice, yet both tasted alright."
Mike C.,"Rumford, East Providence, RI",2,44,,4.0,7/22/2017,"Really good food. Their menu is vast, with many favorite ethnic varieties and appeals. Like their other locations, this TCF is quite elegant. The decor appears to me like a fusion of Venetian and Egyptian art and architecture. When you go, don't forget to leave room for dessert - especially, of course, for their cheesecakes."
David E.,"BUZZARDS BAY, MA",1,93,,4.0,6/30/2017,"Ate here today with my mom and aunt. My mother got crab cakes and stuffed mushrooms. and my aunt ordered flatbread pizza and a side salad. I picked two items. First, I got something new from the ""small plate"" options, Nashville Hot Chicken Nuggets (if you've never had Nashville Hot Chicken, it's fried chicken brushed with a spicy paste that includes smoked paprika and cayenne pepper, then served with dill pickle slices and white bread). For my entree, I picked a filet mignon grilled well done, with mashed potatoes. To drink, we all just had ice water. My mother and aunt only said they really enjoyed their food, not saying too much more about it. I really liked the Nashville Hot Chicken Nuggets (any time I can get boneless chicken is a plus) they were a different take on spicy chicken than buffalo wings, and pickles were a nice touch. Unlike hot chicken served in Nashville, this did not come with any bread, just pickles and a side of ranch for dipping. My filet was cooked just as I wanted it, juicy and flavorful, with no pink in the middle. I know that Cheesecake Factory is one of those restaurants where the prices are on the expensive side, but I didn't even see how much the bill came to, because my aunt snatched it up right away, and announced she was paying for lunch, and didn't want any arguments. No problem here. Our waitress was friendly and attentive (frequently coming by to see if our water glasses needed refilling, and doing so without us having to ask her). Our food did take quite a while to come out from the kitchen, but we attributed that to the crowded dining room. I'll be back soon. I hope they keep that Nashville Hot Chicken on the menu."
Kevin O.,"Albany, NY",0,19,,2.0,10/8/2017,The appetizers were good and of course the cheesecake is great. All four of the entrees we had were awful. We barely touched them. I remember them being better in the past. The bill was pretty high and we felt like we wasted our money. I might go for apps and cheesecake or get cheesecake to go.
Nessy M.,"Cranston, RI",4,60,3,1.0,9/23/2016,"An update as the decline of the cheesecake factory continues!!!! ......this is on par with their numerous recent health code violations by the way......I'm only here because of a gift card I received for my birthday. I didn't know what to get so I go with something I've gotten many times before....the orange chicken. In the past the chicken has definitely been a slightly better quality and the vegetables were way too salty this time around. Too much soy sauce. My boyfriend got the Catfish. I tried a bite and it literally tasted like pure dirt/mud. We Google immediately what the flavor is supposed to be and come to find that the dirt flavor stems from not being washed/soaked properly. YUCK!!! He asks to take it back and get something else. This time the chicken and biscuits. It was good except when I took a bite, got a little crunchy sensation.  Previously I had asked for a ginger ale which I don't know why took so long. So she finally brings out a small bottle of Canada dry that has already been opened?!?!?!?! Wtf. Prior to this also she brings my boyfriend a water with dirt on the outside of the cup!!!!! Like come on people. Open your eyes before bringing guests stuff!!! Overall our waitress was not the best nor the most attentive. The couple next to us got more attention and service for sure. Straighten the fuck up cheesecake factory, your health code violations weren't too pretty so I'm guessing you could get shut down! Tonight is my last night here."
Andy P.,"Fitchburg, MA",4,11,,4.0,7/1/2017,"Food and dessert were great, but wish they would post the alcoholic drink prices on the menu.   $11.50 for a Sangria and another $11.50 for a mixed drink!   That's insane, seeing it's about the cost of a meal!   Normally these should not be more than $8 at any other place..."
Theodore H.,"Providence, RI",0,89,1,1.0,7/16/2017,"If you get a waiter named Oscar---go to a different place to eat. Rude, pushy, rushing and insulting at one point. Plus all the food was served cold. We tried to tell someone, but the waiter never was to be found.  Sitting outside here means you be forgotten.  Never understood the long wait times for this diner, and it felt like a New Jersey diner."
Jolene R.,"Providence, RI",102,141,23,2.0,8/7/2016,Cheesecake Factory is good for just that cheesecake... The other items on the menu are overpriced and not always on point. We waited 45 mins for an appetizer of boneless buffalo wings that tasted like franks red hot x 100. Then our meals arrive but only 2 out of the 4 the other 2 came 25 mins later.... 140$ for 4 and not an awesome experience. I have had better. The chicken potstickers tasted like the sauce they were in --- the cheesesteak sandwiches were fair.
Samantha G.,"Scituate, MA",280,61,508,5.0,2/13/2016,"Cheesecake Factory is the best! Everything on the menu is delicious. The menu is more like a novel; so many options from drinks to entrees and appetizers and of course, dessert! Any time is the perfect time for this restaurant. Just this year alone, I went for my birthday, New Year's Eve, and to celebrate my first year in college.  My favorite items here are the orange chicken with white rice plate, the tropical iced tea, the Godiva cheesecake, the strawberry shortcake dessert, and the salted caramel cheesecake. Side note, the bread and butter there is always warm and fluffy. The brown bread is my favorite.  Happy service, great food, great atmosphere. Definitely go here!"
Mike F.,"Worcester, MA",0,1,,1.0,3/26/2017,"I have been waiting in line to get my 8 year old daughter a gift certificate for over 20 minutes.  The manager (?) has been dealing with the same customer the entire time and they keep passing the customer's phone back and forth.  This is the worst service that I have ever witnessed in my life.   I understand problem customers, but enough is enough. Also, where is some extra help to alleviate this ridiculous situation? Is it a computer situation? Override it.  The line is getting hostile.  Now up to 25 minutes.  I'd leave if my daughter didn't want to come back here so badly. There's a waitress who can't leave until she checks out here and no one seems to care about their own employee!! Not even 1 apology at this point.   Utterly unfathomable service. F- overall."
