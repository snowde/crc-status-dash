Joanne K.,"Myrtle Beach, SC",0,5,,2.0,9/18/2017,"I went to The Cheesecake Factory when I was in town for business.  The food was good, the service was very poor.  I sat at the bar and there were two bartenders behind the bar.  When I sat down at the bar had two other people sitting at the bar and then me.  Later there was only one other person and myself.  It wasn't like it was very extremely busy at the bar.  Once I received my food and had several bites, one of the bar tenders asked how it was.  The two bartenders got talking that the customers were not receiving service.  I finished up and sat there watching them talking as I had my receipt and payment in my handle trying to get their attention. They continued to talk.  Finally I was able to get one of the bartenders attention and  made payment. Not once did one of the bartenders asked if I wanted dessert or anything else."
Mike R.,"Fall River, MA",86,186,39,3.0,2/14/2016,"We came here on Valentines Day, as you could imagine it was very busy!!! Wait was approximately an hour and a half. Once we were finally seated, food and service was good. Waitress got pulled off of our table once and we were assigned a different server, putting aside the confusion service was good. Food was spot on. I ordered the herb crusted salmon/shrimp scampi combo plate. It was great!! We ordered coffee and naturally cheesecake. I ordered the Reece's pb cheesecake. It was delicious!!! Our server forgot our sugar when we ordered our coffee and we had no plates with our bread early on when we were finally seated. I truly understand the minor confusion as it was busy. Again, with the bits of confusion things overall was decent.      In closing, my two suggestions/requests would be to shorten up their menu. I mean really, when I was done looking at their menu I felt like I just completed reading a book!!! Way too big of a menu and way too many options, seriously. Less at times is better!!! Also, beer options are seriously lacking here. Very few options to choose from. Sure there is the traditional domestic garbage beer on tap and limited bottle options, but nothing spectacular here. I decided to go with the Sierra Nevada Pale Ale. Really it was the only decent quality beer here. In this case mor is better. More meaning more quality beer. Alot of local breweries in the area of Providence. These breweries product should be here at the Cheesecake Factory!!!!"
Mckayla W.,"Newport, RI",92,3,1,5.0,7/7/2016,This is prob one of my favorite restaurants. Every time I go I get the bang bang chic and shrimp. Their cocktails never disappoint. To drink I had the pin apple mojito and ultimate margarita. My fiancé had the Kobe beef burger and my daughter Delilah had the grilled cheese. Everything was amazing.! Now I have been here before and received pretty poor service but didn't hold it against them because I am in the industry and the food is still Delish. This review however is specifically for our server Anthony S.  He was very fun. He didn't have to read specials off a little notepad but he remembered it and all while not sounding like a robot (I hate that) he was for the most part being himself which is awesome. He was extremely patient with my four year old Delilah who had a lot of questions that Anthony had no problem answering. He made her smile the whole time. When the food came out he was concerned about delilahs plate being hot so he brought out a side plate and even helped her cut it so that it could cool off.  I am in the industry and have been for 11 years Anthony actually taught me something last night and I thought I knew it all. What a great server. If he's not the head server you should most definitely make him one and he would also make an excellent manager. I will deff be back and ask for Anthony. Thanks Anthony!!
Nicole M.,"Manchester, CT",0,17,2,1.0,11/10/2016,Came for a marriage retreat with 32 people and asked for seating together. Was told it was not possible so everyone had to break into groups of 4.  Poor customer service and extremely disappointed with the service. Once seated it was very very slow service!!! The food was okay but service all around was way too slow and we were exhausted and didn't enjoy it that much. Definitely would pick another restaurant with a group next time.
Erika G.,"Portland, OR",2,11,13,3.0,4/25/2016,"I've been to Cheesecake Factory in OR and CA and this one was the worst experience.  It was Friday lunch time so I understand there was long waiting for food.  I ordered a spaghetti and meatballs, the meatballs were buried and very hard I couldn't bit it.  I told my server they brought new meatballs but I had to wait quite awhile again.  The server apologized me but overall the service and food wasn't good enough for 2 dollar signs restaurant."
Shaji K.,"Fort Snelling, MN",0,43,6,3.0,8/5/2016,"We were seated promptly, and the bread and appetizers came quickly. The food came in HUGE portions, tasted great. Service was okay; waited a long time to order cheesecake but it was delicious!"
Laura M.,"Pepperell, MA",0,1,,1.0,5/30/2017,"Miserable customer service.  I called weeks ago to make a reservation for 15 to have a family celebration.  I called today to confirm.  Despite looking at my reservation while on the phone with me, both the person that answered the phone and later a manager refused to honor the reservation because they ""don't take reservations.""  They did let me make the reservation and now with 3 days to go I need to find another restaurant that can take the 15 of us or wait another 6 weeks.  Apparently they were just going to let us all show up and stand there and wait for the next table of 15 to open up.  Ridiculous!  Never again."
Chelsea S.,"Providence, RI",124,2,,2.0,1/4/2017,I had originally come in just for cheesecake and the original person I spoke to was so nice and told up to sit if we wanted to eat even thought they were closing shortly. The waitress I had never told me her name and barely came to check up on us throughout our meal. The drinks were warm and ice melted quickly. The food was not worth the hype and completely overpriced. Cheesecake was am amazing but the over all experience was shit
Steve L.,"Wareham, MA",0,42,70,5.0,12/22/2015,Luisiana pasta dish = awesome!  My go to meal. Great people and food.   Bar was great - servers were on top of game. Busy holiday day and continued to perform
Stephanie V.,"Providence, RI",26,20,2,2.0,1/9/2017,"Yesterday was my 32nd birthday, my girls surprised me with munchies and cake at the Cheesecake factory, which use to be my favorite restaurant. When we talk to the front desk to make arrangements for a table it was a 45 minute wait but it was okay we knew it was going to take that long anyway because it's such a popular place. My friends go and tell the front desk this is our best friend's birthday please do something really special. The front desk stand  (female, African American & gentleman) stated of course we're going to embarrass her will do something really special and they complimented on how Young I look. I was so excited. 45 minutes later we are lead to our seat. They let us up the stairs and I thought we were going to the booth dining room area but they made us literally took a loop all the way around the restaurant just to sit right where we were sitting waiting for us to be called. That was slightly annoying.  The gentleman who served us was very quiet made no Small Talk whatsoever. Asked us what we wanted to drink we give him our drink order and our appetizer order and we wanted to look a little bit longer on the menu. He did not come back to take our order until 15-20 minutes later. Then he disappeared for another 15-20 minutes, returning finally with drinks and our appetizer. We tell him our order, which we ordered several slices of their cheesecakes for all of us to sample.  The slices are huge and they tasted amazing but when he came back he just dropped off our cakes and walked off but back back two minutes later with the entire staff to sing happy birthday to another table across from us.  They looked completely stunned because they did not request nor had a birthday in their party. Comes to find out they screwed that up so we just paid the check and left. The food and cakes are amazing, the service seriously stinks...I am gonna sadly find a new location that not only have great food, desserts and extremely better service."
Ameer W.,"Newark, NJ",756,60,645,5.0,9/18/2015,"I'm a regular at the Cheesecake Factory and I came here for my first time in Providence, RI after taking the advice of a coworker. I'm a cheesecake fanatic, but the advice was sound, ""You're in a new city, sample the local flavor."" I agreed that line of thinking made sense and it had occurred to me, but I still planned to have some cheesecake since the Cheesecake Factory was just a block away.  The local fair I decided to try was a let down, and only the beer I had was worth it. So I didn't eat and beat my feet back up the hill.  Because I wanted to room for my cheesecake and this place always gives a hefty piece, I opted for 2 appetizers rather than a meal. I decided on the: *Chicken Samosas - Crispy wrappers filled with spiced chicken. Served with cilantro dipping sauce. $5.95 *Crispy Crab Bites - Bite sized little crab cakes served with mustard sauce.  While the samosas were good, I didn't entirely enjoy the pairing with the cilantro sauce, though it wasn't bad. The crab bites and mustard bites were nearly divine and at 6 for an appetizer, that's more than enough.  For the reason I go to the Cheesecake Factory I tried a new cake flavor that I've never had. Which was: *Fresh Banana Cream Cheesecake - Banana cream cheesecake topped with Bavarian Cream and fresh sliced bananas (I got my bananas on the side.) This is probably officially my favorite cheesecake flavor now.  I had a wonderful solo experience and can't wait to sample the food and dessert here in Providence, RI again, or one of my local factories here in NJ"
Rick G.,"Cambridge, MA",30,2,,2.0,4/16/2017,"I honestly only come here for dessert. The last two times I've been here my experience with the food hasn't been great. One time I ordered the fish and chips, and the fish was drenched in oil and was still raw. The other time I ordered a steak and asked for it to be cooked medium and it was cooked well done.  I also witnessed the couple sitting next to me re-enact Drake's Child's Play music video and get into a huge argument. I'd be surprised if they're still together."
Ulrike W.,"Bronx, NY",15,116,217,3.0,8/30/2016,"The usual! Lol. Very nice tho. But just don't sit outside in the summer. There were bees or wasps  (I'm a city girl, I don't know the difference), they literally ate off our plates. My friend ordered the eggs, which were no longer over easy by the time they got to the table..."
Naveen R.,"East Providence, RI",0,69,140,4.0,4/30/2017,"Visited on a Saturday evening. Very crowded. Had to wait for 15-20 mins before we got our seat. Expensive. No dedicated parking available, just few street parkings nearby. They have outside seating, enjoyed that part. Service was fast and server was courteous and helpful. Food was delicious and top notch. Really liked their authentic classic cheesecake."
Kenneth P.,"East Providence, RI",522,2,,1.0,8/20/2017,"So I decided to go to the Cheesecake Factory. My first mistake was sitting outside. The tables and floor was so disgusting and the smell was horrible. I ordered the fish soft shell tacos with fries. When the dish came to my table it was 4 small soft shell fish tacos with the smallest piece of grilled fish I've ever seen. The service was very slow. Note to self "" NEVER COME BACK HERE AGAIN"""
Michael R.,"Providence, RI",14,11,,5.0,3/31/2017,"I personally dont understand all the negative posts.   Are you hoping management will give you a gift card to come back if you whine loud enough???? Of course the wait is going to be long, its attached to a huge mall, near the statehouse, and the train station, and on a very busy main street.   Were you thinking it'd be a 5 minute wait???   Hell, even The 99 has an hour long wait at times.   If waiting is such a problem for you, order-out.  Yes, The Cheesecake Factory menu IS available to-go. Now as far as the menu... Yes it has alot to offer.  I would think thats a bonus.  You certainly cant get bored of your menu choices.  To have that many options, and to have them arrive at your table well prepared deinitely says something about the kitchen staff.   The food is always delicious!!!! I have NEVER had any issue with the waitstaff.  EVER.   They've always been sweet, interested, and attentive. My guess as to why you need to go outside to the restaurant is so they dont have to close when the mall does.  Remember theres also an entrance inside the parking garage. Lastly...the cheesecake.    I almost always have a hard time choosing which one to get.  Whenever I go there with friends we always order different cheesecakes so we can take turns trying each others."
Chtistian X V.,"Novato, CA",62,7,67,5.0,1/31/2017,"This place is really nice, a little pricey but at the same time it is in down town, there is no parking lot, need to find parking on the street. My kids loved it as we did too."
John B.,"North Providence, RI",0,5,1,1.0,7/30/2017,Don't order to go food on a Sunday night ever!!!!! Awful service... we ordered two Kale salads and chicken pot stickers and a piece of cheese cake.. They just couldn't get it done!!! An hour later we had no food.. They gave us the wrong salads.. then they told us that they ran out of the pot stickers and the cheesecake... Of course...It was close to closing time....never again...
Gemma+Jasper H.,"New York City, NY",0,27,3,3.0,8/16/2016,"Overall the cheese cake factory is a nice place with a lot of choice. We had to wait more that half an hour an the connection with the buzzer was lost and we had to wait for another 15 min. We were seated in the back and it was freezing out there. Most of the food was nice but don't take the Evelyn's favorite past, that tasted like nothing. The Godiva chocolate cheesecake made up for the pasta.  Good to know is that there are gluten free options."
Elu R.,"Hope Valley, RI",0,35,15,2.0,2/7/2017,"We went for a late dinner last Saturday evening after a show at the Vets. Lucky to grab the last two seats at the bar. We were met by a miserable bartender who was obviously put out by having to clear the spot for us. We should have just taken this as a sign and went elsewhere- but it was late.  Things got so much worse from here. Let's talk food. That second star up there is for my husband's burger. He loved it. I opted for the lettuce wraps. The chicken was not edible- it had not been cleaned properly...don't need to further elaborate. Atmosphere- would have been great- but there was an inch of dust on the bottles located above the bar- makes you wonder what else is dirty that we cannot see! Now back to that sweetheart of a bartender . He began to talk to the girls seated next to us about his co worker with bad body odor, and complained about a customer wanting the celtics on the TV. This guy has no place in the front of the house. Nice etiquette.  This review is being written after I contacted the establishment directly with my concerns and was not acknowledged. They obviously do not care about their guests experiences.  Word to the wise- grab a table and skip the lettuce wraps."
