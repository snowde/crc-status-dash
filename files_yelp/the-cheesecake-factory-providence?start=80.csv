Vinny P.,"Johnston, RI",2,48,1,3.0,7/4/2017,"I don't know what's going on with this place the last few years....This waitress we had today was probably the worst I've had in the 10 plus years I've coming here....the only thing that keeps me coming back is the food, because the service is terrible lately.  To start off, i asked her for Coke with lemon....she brought it to the table and it had no lemon....then I asked her for more butter for my bread....and she never brought it....it seemed like the food was NEVER! going to come, and every time she would go by the table she would never ask us if we needed anything, not a drink refill or nothing......mind you there was nobody in the place....not busy at all, so quick service shouldn't of been a problem....FINALLY! the food came....and thank God the food was better than the service....I wanted desert but I didn't feel like waiting another half hour for....it took long enough for the meal to come out....the service was so bad we had to ask another waitress for our bill....                Service like this can ruin a restaurant, it certain doesn't make me wanna return anytime soon....and it's too bad cus the food is very good....and that's the only reason why I come back....               I hope they step up they're game!!"
Miranda D.,"Myrtle Beach, SC",7,202,189,5.0,8/7/2015,"Great date night restaurant to go to!! We've come numerous times for a nice dinner out! Expect to spend a little more here, but it's totally worth it!! The menu is huge!!! So much to choose from!! I would usually opt for the pasta alfredo, ugh seriously amazing! And my other half would usually get the orange chicken! And we'd split a cheesecake! The size of the meals are pretty large. Most times you'd have enough for take home for the next day.  The staff are nice and the wait time is usually right! Whenever they say the wait is 20 mins, we wait 20 mins and not anymore more.  If you get up to use the restroom, just be careful! The staff run around like crazy!!! I've come close to bumping into someone booking it out of the kitchen to go wait in a table! Or people carrying out cheesecakes for the front counter."
Keely W.,"New London, CT",0,9,6,5.0,7/28/2017,We came to the Cheesecake Factory for a late lunch/early dinner and our experience was so delightful. Our server Jay brown ( I believe his name was ) was a great server and did everything to make our experience as best as possible! Continuously making sure everything was up to par and boxing our food for us and insisting on making sure we had all the sauces that it was served with! We will be making another trip back!
Alex C.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",27,12,,3.0,7/24/2016,We wait 50 minutes and finally sit and wait 20 minutes to first waiters come to us ask drink and then after 10 minutes our drink order come to us and my diet coke no taste and no acidic properties  and I asked to waiters he told to me Soda Fountain some problem and he charged to me this un-drinkable soda order But we ordered classic food and food is 8/10 nice and delicious not 10/10 I Guess this Cheesecake need some training and modernization and choose more careful waiters and etc.  Garson ( Waiter ) not a trained and fast but at the same time good humor and person I left 10 percent tips because he charged to me soda price Alex
Carrie P.,"Lakeville, MA",103,62,3,5.0,6/23/2016,"We have eaten here before and everything is always good. This time I would say our visit was a 10 out of 10! Joe B was our waiter and from the moment we sat down and he brought my 2yr old a cut up banana with brown bread I was happy! He was friendly and very helpful with my husbands shellfish allergy. I asked about the soup of the day and he offered me a sample.  Everyone I have ever met at the Cheesecake Factory is nice and friendly but Jay made an extra effort and I hope he is recognized for it. Thank you Jay for a wonderful dinner, we will be back to see you.  We ordered the Blue cheese and pear flatbread to start, it was amazing My husband had the fried chicken sliders and the beet salad for dinner and said he would order it again.  I tried the Thai lettuce wraps and again, awesome!"
Jake T.,"Charlestown, RI",142,6,,2.0,2/18/2017,"Last Wednesday my girlfriend and I went here for a late Valentine's Day dinner. She's gluten free so all she wanted was a grilled chicken. Instead, they brought out breaded chicken. She told our waiter multiple times that she was gluten free. She then told our waiter she wanted grilled chicken not breaded. Took them well over a half hour to get her just a grilled chicken. And our cheesecakes were VERY small. We've had better experiences there."
Ana P.,"North Providence, RI",0,5,7,5.0,7/19/2015,"Such a wide variety of culture when it comes to their menu! They have everything you could possibly dream of! Extensive range of appetizer, drinks, entrees, and desserts! One of my favorite restaurants in RI! Impressive for a chain restaurant. Last night I had the Shrimp & Steak Diane which was absolutely amazing, and filled with flavor. Finished it off with my favorite cheesecake, Banana Cream!"
Patricia M.,"North Attleboro, MA",4,101,10,3.0,5/2/2016,I think they have too many items on the menu to do anything really well.  I have been here several times and haven't been wowed in years.
Vanessa G.,"Cranston, RI",1,13,6,2.0,12/17/2016,Obnoxious waitresses. Not surprised ppl haven't been giving this place a good rating...
Jen P.,"Summerville, SC",118,505,267,4.0,10/28/2016,"There is no Cheesecake Factory in my everyday life, so when I travel, I try to find a local Cheesecake Factory. I'm addicted. I always order a small meal because it's all about the cheesecake. In this case, I ordered the sausage and ricotta flatbread and the Chris's Outrageous Cheesecake. Both were exceptional. The flatbread had just the right amount of ricotta - enough to taste yummy but not so much to make the flatbread mushy. As an added bonus there was a little spinach. That was a surprise that tasted so good. I was catching a flight a little later, so I ate part of my dessert there and took the rest with me. Both servings were so good. Chris's Outrageous has tons of chocolate, some coconut, and real cheesecake. It's truly wonderful overkill. If you like Cheesecake Factory, you'll like this one. It's a little out of the way in the mall (hard to find) and the service was average, but overall a good experience."
Marty L.,"Denver, CO",0,23,,5.0,6/26/2017,"Dinner was amazing.  The Thai shrimp was tasty with just right amount of spices,  Service was fabulous,  very helpful with finding my sons phone."
Tracey C.,"Lincoln, RI",13,6,,2.0,6/26/2016,So disappointed ...it took one hour for our sandwiches to be done(and it wasn't even busy in there)As our waitress gave me my sand which she apologized saying the salad department was backed up. So my salad was gross..lots of wilted greens and soggy from loads of dressing on   half sand which was okay..cup of roasted pepper chicken soup had one piece of chicken and loaded with huge chunks of mushrooms. So as if this wasn't bad enough waitress came over apologized again said my lunch would be taken off and we would get a piece of cheesecake on the house. She didn't come back for another 25 minutes.i knew she was having a hard time with a customer at the other table so I didn't give her a hard time..but did tell her we wanted to leave and enjoy the day (we were there 2 1/2 hours total.) Still tipped her well but I won't be back.
Radd M.,"Bellingham, WA",4,67,4,5.0,10/7/2016,Fully straightened out.  I went twice in the past week and everything was spot on.  I'd definitely go again.  No complaints.
Doro K.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,7,2,2.0,5/31/2017,"Came here on Memorial Day at 4:50 PM. They said the wait would be 20-30 minutes for a party of two, so we decided to wait. I noticed that service seemed really slow (short on staff because of Memorial Day?), as I looked around and saw that for the entire time we had been waiting, there were two dirty tables that had not been cleared off (they were dirty for 40 minutes and could have seated at least 6 people total). 45 minutes later, we were finally seated, at one of those tables that had finally been cleared! After we were seated, it took the waitress 20 minutes to get our bread to us. Usually I come to the Cheesecake Factory because it's reliable (both service and food quality) - you know what you're getting. However, I won't be back to this one because of the service. Giving two stars because the food was still the same as usual."
Chris L.,"Boston, MA",544,356,153,3.0,12/20/2014,"Whenever I walk into a chain like The Cheesecake Factory, there are some things that I expect. For this restaurant, I expect to peruse the menu for at least half hour without reading every item and for my entree that I eventually select to be on point. This location delivers just that, but it's what I received outside of that expectation that encouraged me to write this review. The service here is something to be mentioned. Not only is is it welcoming and efficient, but the staff here goes out of their way to make sure that you are as a guest are having the best time possible. When you go out of your way to have a nice dinner, you want to make sure that you are going to get just that and then some. And while a successful chain like The Cheesecake Factory doesn't need much praise to keep them in business, I think a staff like this one deserves some necessary praise. Kudos, y'all!"
Benjamin A.,"Coventry, RI",177,78,163,2.0,8/7/2016,"DID SOMEONE SAY CHEESECAKE?! I don't know about all of you, but my girlfriend and I sure love cheesecake, but honestly that is probably the only thing that is actually really good at this restaurant.  I normally order the burrito grande and allows enjoy it and the food seems to be just above average for the rest of the menu from what I here from friends and those whom we eat out with.  Honestly I believe some of the meals are overpriced and the service as been diminishing since this place became so well known.  My girlfriend and I went here this past Friday with two friends of ours and left not as satisfied as we expected.  I ordered the burrito, like I said, and she ordered the eggplant parm.  My meal was very good and filling and was at a cost of around $15.  Her meal was similar in price; however, the eggplant was very dry, the pasta was plain, and there wasn't much sauce that came on it at all.  Overall she was not satisfied with the meal she had gotten.  My friends ordered two pasta dishes and seemed to enjoy them enough; however, weren't ecstatic about their meals either.  We started off the meal with the traditional bread which is allows some that that is great to hold you over before a meal.  We also ordered the nachos and my two friends bought two beers to start as well.  The nachos were pretty good; however, it took an extremely long time to get them and that something that simply shouldn't occur with an appetizer.  My friends beers were at a cost of $9 which is a little pricey especially for the common beers that they chose. The beers took over 15 minutes to get to the table and that is another thing we were disappointed in.  The server seemed like a robot not really caring about what we wanted, but more so focusing on giving some what of an automated and typical  introduction of the menu.  She was polite; however, very slow.  We all ordered cheesecakes to go and three of us had meals to take home.  The server took each plate and wrapped them for us, but when she gave them back to us she handed them to us individually and when we all got home we realized she had given two of us the wrong meals.  We had already parted ways at this point so we weren't able to switch them back.  The cheesecake was very good as it always is.  I had the red velvet cheesecake and Tori had the Oreo cheesecake and they were both very good.  Honestly this place has changed since it began and not in a good way.  Overall the food was subpar for what you pay for, but the cheesecake was still good.  I'm not sure if I will come back again due to the bad service and average food, but I may be back just for the cheesecake because that is the one category they never disappoint me with."
Alik G.,"Providence, RI",30,23,4,5.0,4/20/2016,"Mmmhhh! It is so delicious! Devine!! I mean it's a cheesecake haven. You can't be disappointed. Well, okay, you can if you pick that line cake. Also their food is pretty good. With that being said, Juniors is still the best."
Kendra M.,"Acushnet, MA",0,31,16,3.0,4/20/2017,"Recently went here to celebrate my younger brother's birthday. The service was really great; our waitress was friendly and attentive. Most of the food was pretty good, and the cheesecake was great. However, my brother and I were both disappointed with our meals. I got the French Country salad, which was field greens, beets, asparagus, candied walnuts, and goat cheese (which I switched out for bleu cheese). I've gotten the salad previously at another Cheesecake Factory location and really enjoyed it, but this time not so much. The beets tasted like they had been fermented in a salt brine. The last time I ordered this, they did not taste that way. The salty flavor did not complement this sweet salad at all, and it was just plain funky. My brother ordered a cheese pizza...It looked pretty soggy and it smelled kind of funny...like a freezer burnt TV dinner. Everyone else had burgers and they were all satisfied with those. I'd come back (definitely for the cheesecake!), but I don't see what all the hype is about this place."
Ameena D.,"New York, NY",96,406,,5.0,11/10/2014,"I don't usually write reviews of the Cheesecake Factory, but I had to take a minute and write one for this particular location, mainly because the service here was just fantastic. I wish I could remember our server's name, because she was the sweetest girl and provided better service than we've had in many far more expensive restaurants. The food was also fantastic: -- Bread - always a highlight. I always eat WAY too much of it, thus why I order off the Skinnylicious (sp?) menu. -- Singapore Shrimp Rolls - I think this is what they are called? Anyway, these were my entrée and were delicious. -- Child's Bowtie Pasta - my 9-year-old devoured this.  -- Baja Chicken Tacos - my husband devoured this. And he rarely devours anything. -- Linda's Fudge Cake - One of the best desserts we've ever had, anywhere. This is the main reason we venture out to Cheesecake Factory. Overall: Sure this is a chain restaurant but it's a really good one. I just wish they'd open one in NYC!"
Chase W.,"New York, NY",17,15,22,1.0,11/1/2015,"Waited about a half hour for a table & once we were seated at a table we were ignored. Sat for almost 8-10 minutes without being introduced to a server or waitress & had to witness horrible service & issues at surrounding tables. (Hair in food, and delayed chicken appetizers.)  I called over someone who resembled a manager role to bring this to her attention & she seemed rather blank & unconcerned.  It's awfully sad to write this, as I traveled over an hour to providence to dine here with my family. We ended up leaving after no help and heading over to other favorite, Joes (down the street). We'll eat here two days in a row anytime!"
