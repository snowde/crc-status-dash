Cynthia E.,"Omaha, NE",5,40,29,5.0,8/17/2017,Delicious!  Gonna regret this day. Sort of.  Vanilla cheesecake with strawberries!  Yummy
Robbie C.,"Wake Forest, NC",306,610,1747,3.0,10/26/2017,"Have been to this Cheesecake Factory, located at Crabtree Valley Mall several times. The service I experienced was sufficient.  Seating at the restaurant is hit or miss. If seated in a round booth, you will have a much nicer experience than sitting in the bar area. The tables are just way too close to enjoy the experience.  The menu has always been pages and pages of options. So it's pretty much dependent on what you order.  This visit, I opted for a California guacamole salad. It was huge and no humanoid could eat this size portion in a single sitting. So, while the prices seem higher than normal, know that you will have leftovers!  The salad was way to heavy on the cilantro, I do like cilantro, but next time would opt out as that overpowered the other flavors of the dish.  Cheesecake is a must as that is an awesome treat to take home and I always enjoy the Adams peanut butter, though it doesn't really taste like cheesecake, more like a peanut butter pie."
Mike H.,"Apex, NC",0,13,6,1.0,10/8/2017,"Wow, worst service AND worst meal ever. Waited 10 minutes just to place our drinks order. 15 more minutes and finally stopped another waitress for our bread. I ordered the Shrimp Scampi with the Diana Steak. Shrimp was over cooked and rubbery, steak undercooked and had so much pepper I had to scrap it off just to get some steak flavor. The sautéed mushrooms were not all cooked. Was a birthday meal and nada, not even a happy birthday to my daughter. The table across from us and the table next to them had the same server. Across from us the two gentlemen got their steaks, ate them, finished their plates and their girlfriends hadn't even been served their salads yet. When the waitress came back out they stopped her and asked where the salad were. ""Oh, the person preparing the salads is really backed up."" The table next to them waiting at least 30 minutes for two appetizers. They were really upset, had to ask for their bill and when he asked about the bill his wife said no way are you leaving any tip. Can't leave her name as they no longer give their name."
Jane S.,"Raleigh, NC",7,19,5,1.0,9/18/2017,"We went to enjoy a brief lunch while wedding shopping. What started with an absolutely exciting day, ended up with sadness and frustration. We we're enjoying lunch when I heard one of your servers approach the bar and start yelling out ""vietnahhh rolls"" in a very offensive fashion. This was in apparent mockery of Vietnamese people. He continually did it even after I stopped eating, got my fiance's attn and was visably shaken. I was so disturbed, I excused myself and went to the restroom to try and regain my composure over such an uncomfortable situation.  When I returned, I asked my waiter for a sidebar. After explaining my displeasure, he responds with, "" well, Im a minority and so is he, so we get it."" I'm not trying down playing his heritage but does being a minority in this situation really better it (he was a white male)? I explained that it felt like the other server was making a mockery of Vietnamese people. Not only did he agree but continue to confirm the server was making fun of his customer and the gentlemen I was speaking to (Steve) was sorry I overheard. Not sorry it happened.....sorry I heard (I asked twice to confirm). He then proceeded to state ""next time I'll tell him not to say it where other customers can hear."" He was further offensive to ask if I was mentioning my displeasure to get a free meal. I asked him not to cheapen the situation by offering me something I already intended to pay for, that's not what this was about. I couldn't stay any longer, gave him my credit card and asked my fiance to finish the transaction for me. I found out later, he told my fiance, ""she told me not to, but don't worry....I took the pasta off"". Lol, if only that was my worry. Apparently, the entire point was missed"
Debra M.,"Morrisville, NC",100,31,21,3.0,1/8/2018,"The server was fine. The food was fine. The cleanliness of the establishment was pretty awful. I admit that it was late on a Saturday 9:30pm when we arrived but it was dirty. The floor had multiple things on it and the women's rooms were a disaster area. I was pretty disappointed by that because, honestly, I believe that cheesecake factories are usually run efficiently and cleanly. There have been tons of articles about their methods and how healthcare should replicate it. I would not want my hospital to look that dirty though...I hardly even wanted to stand on the bathroom floor. I've been in nicer Wal-Mart bathrooms."
Anne P.,"Raleigh, NC",177,29,132,3.0,12/10/2017,Chicken Marsala and Gumbo. As usual Cheesecake Factory delivers good food! Service is always excellent and the place is clean and cozy.
Heather B.,"Wake Forest, NC",2,151,380,3.0,7/27/2017,"Frustrating experience at Cheesecake Factory.  The place was absolutely mobbed at 1:15 on a Thursday.   The hostess was not friendly at all - asked how many then told us to stand to the side.  Didn't crack a smile once in dealing with us or subsequent three parties that tumbled in after us.  We were seated pretty fast at a totally claustrophobic two top sandwiches between two more tables.  When I say a tight fit, it was so bad that we didn't talk much during our lunch because the lady to our left talked loudly on her cell the entire time and on our other side the four top chit chatted loudly so we just sort of sat.  Our waiter was friendly and smiled, but he was overwhelmed, I think.  Our water went empty twice and we had to ask a different wait person to fill our drinks.  The crab and artichoke dip was good but the bread that came with it was so hard it was difficult to chew gracefully, or really at all. I ended up eating the dip with my fork!  Our waiter kept asking me if we wanted bread, we said yes twice and it arrived when our first appetizer did.  Kind of a fail.   The Firecracker Shrimp was good, sauce spicy.  The side salad had barely any dressing and just was not good.   My lunch partner ordered tomato basil pasta, it was ok.  Nothing to rave about.   Overall, food is overpriced, service is pretty slow, and dang this place is expensive! Two waters, two appetizers, one entree, one side salad was $50.  Blerg."
Gessica C.,"Raleigh, NC",204,76,153,4.0,5/16/2017,"This has got to be my 100th time at Cheesecake factory! I love this place. Such a great selection of food items to choose from. I've gotten anything from a great salad to a burger and my favorites, their pastas!  I visited on a Friday night and of course it was super busy due to the Crabtree mall traffic. After a 25 minute wait we were seated and promptly attended to. I LOVE their wheat bread! I always have to stop myself from asking for more because I don't want to get too full for my meal. I ordered the pasta carbonara and it is delicious. So many different flavors that blends so wonderfully together. Peas, bacon, and garlic parmesan sauce, SO GOOD! Another one of my favorite pasta is the Louisiana chicken pasta! Bowtie pasta, creamy sauce, and fried chicken!  You cannot visit the Cheesecake factory without trying their cheesecakes, and let me tell you, you can't go wrong with any of the choices! If you need a tip try the Red Velvet!"
Kristy A.,"Charlotte, NC",245,388,1080,3.0,3/20/2017,"Late night hunger after a long day of wedding makeup trials brought me to Raleigh's Cheesecake Factory. I ordered zucchini and white bean chicken chili. The zucchini was served with ranch dressing. It was okay, but sounded like something that I could cook on my own. The chili was decent, but there were only about 10 beans in it. I would've appreciated more beans and soup. They also skimped on the rice in the center of the dish. Long story short, it was ""Okay"". Chic-Fil-A's white bean chicken chili (limited time only) for $5 was much better. The service was really good, especially for after 9:00. We sat in the bar area and our waiter was very attentive. He was never out of sight for long and was very friendly. Overall, this was a good experience, but nothing was impressive. I'm set to go to Cheesecake Factory for a birthday party in Charlotte this week, so I'll be getting actual cheesecake then and trying some other menu item."
Nancy O.,"East Flatbush, Brooklyn, NY",8,48,156,4.0,4/25/2017,"Got into town from Buffalo,NY and needed some lunch! I love The Cheesecake Factory so I figured we stop there. The wait was 20minutes but we were seated within 10minutes. We the egg role sampler for an appetizer and it was amazing. The salmon egg role was amazing. I got me the southern fried chicken sandwich minis with a side of sweet potatoes fries and they came out hot and delicious. The fried chicken was well seasoned.  And you can't go to the Cheesecake Factory without getting Cheesecake. I ordered a chocolate walnut Cheesecake and Oh my my my, was it delicious. My diet went out the window the minute I had a bite of that."
Jim E.,"Cary, NC",0,1,,1.0,1/10/2018,"I brought my family out to dinner to celebrate my daughter being home from college in Massachusetts for the holidays. We arrive for dinner at around 7 PM, our food is bought out at 7:55, which is fine with drinks, bread and conversation. The only problem was that my meal, the chicken Parmesan ""pizza style"", did not come out. I am told it'll be right out, then I am told it was ""sold to someone else"" and they are re-making it and it would be out in 5 minutes. At 8:06 they offer to bring me some soup, so I say okay, might as well eat something while everyone else is eating. At 8:17, a full 22 minutes after everyone else's meal is delivered, my dinner shows up. 2 in my party have finished eating, and 1 ate so slow waiting for my food to come out that their food is cold (the other meal was a salad, so I guess it was already not hot.) By that time, I have been hitting the water and ate half the bowl of soup so I could only eat a little bit of the chicken.  We get all our leftovers boxed up and when the bill comes, I tell the waitress that I do not want to pay for the chicken parm that held up the family dinner. The manager comes over and asks if we were offered soup, which I was, and I told him I ate about half of it, but I ordered chicken parm and it was over 20 minutes later than the rest of the food at the table. I also told him that I did not want to punish the waitress for whatever error was made in the kitchen or with the orders. He told me I had to do what I had to do. I was like, are you serious, you are not going to take the $14.50 off the bill of over $90? He indicated that if I would leave the chicken parm leftovers at the table, he would not charge me for it.  I was shocked - I'd never heard that from a manager before in all my years of frequenting restaurants all over the country. I said to him, what difference does that make, you are just going to throw it out, and you've already created a NOT enjoyable dining experience for us here tonight. He said that if I was going to take the leftovers with me, that he was not going to give me free food. At that point, dinner ruined, I felt kinda bad leaving a $0 tip on a $93 bill, but I felt like that manager gave me no choice. Sorry Salma! Everyone understands that sometimes orders get screwed up, it's part of the experience you go through when you visit any restaurant. But the way it was handled at the Cheesecake Factory, for the price of the ""Experience"" of eating there, was definitely a bad experience. I drove by literally dozens of restaurants to get there, and I will not ever be going back. There are too many places that show they DO care about customers to give any more of my $ to a place like that."
Janie M.,"Cary, NC",19,256,22,4.0,12/15/2017,"This is a tough review for me to write because I really didn't like my dinner.  Everyone else love theirs though and the cheesecake was awesome so I'm thinking maybe Fettuccine Alfredo just isn't their thing.  They managed to somehow make it watery?  I don't know how you do that since it's butter, cream, cheese, and whatever spices you opt to throw in.  This was watery, like maybe it was made with nonfat milk instead of cream.  But it doesn't seem fair to give them lower than a 4-star review when everything else was raved about, including my salted caramel cheesecake.  So I give them four stars with the caveat, don't order the Fettuccine Alfredo!"
Vinny G.,"Apex, NC",2,6,,2.0,9/17/2017,"First off, we have been to this place countless times with no problems and if we do it is normally quickly resolved and we always end up leaving satisfied.  As of 9/17/17, on our occasional trip to the Cheesecake Factory, we ordered the tex mex egg rolls as our appetizer as well as hibachi steak and bang bang chicken and shrimp as our entrees. After about 35 or so minutes, our entrees emerged and me and my wife both were confused. We asked the waiter, who was incredibly understanding and helpful, what happened to our appetizer and he said they didn't ever make them and he would just remove them from our bill.  As I go to eat my hibachi steak, I notice there are chunks of solid potatoes mixed in with the mashed potatoes. Also, the steak, which I ordered medium, came out rare or fresh off the cow.  My wife went to go eat her meal and realized her rice was cold, not even luke warm, and the rice was all clumped together and just disintegrating upon touch.  We asked for a manager to help resolve the situation and make her aware of what went on. When the manager comes over the lady tells me that the potatoes, despite saying mashed on the menu description, are supposed to be ""LUMPY AND BUMPY"" and that the steak I got cooks more rare so I should have asked for it medium well if I wanted it medium. The lady doesn't even address the fact that my wife's meal was cold and our appetizer never came out.  In my time of dining out, I've never had somebody sit there and tell me that I'm wrong and defend the kitchen when the meal that came out was clearly not done correctly. She could have made the situation be done and over with by just saying okay and offering to re cook the dinner but instead wanted to bicker with my wife and I about our meals instead.  The customer service from management was absolutely terrible. The customer service from our waiter, Tyler, was beyond exceptional. He continued to take care of us despite the situation and maintained a positive and helpful attitude throughout. On the bright side, once the food was re cooked, the appetizer came out steaming hot and fresh in 5 minutes and our entrees were both fresh and better than the first time. Although my ""mashed"" potatoes were still ""lumpy and bumpy"". TLDR; didn't get an appetizer, food came out raw with lumpy and bumpy mashed potatoes and wife's food came out cold and nasty rice. Customer service from the manager was terrible but the waiter, Tyler, was exceptional and the second batch of food came out nice and fresh and cooked perfectly, besides the potatoes."
Sai S.,"Raleigh, NC",4,51,8,4.0,5/31/2017,"The ambience was much better than the Durham one.. not the place for a date though ..the place is not cosy and intimate.. we had the skinnylicious veggie burger, came with a green salad which had a yum dressing! The burger itself was a bit bland.. it could've been more flavorful and bigger for the price.. I felt the portions are less for the price.. good place to eat if you are around shopping in Crabtree.. but I've had better burgers elsewhere! Cheesecake is must if you are eating at cheese cake factory! The coffee cheesecake was divine as was the banana cheesecake .. both were delicious I particularly liked the coffee one! Simply yummy! Must visit for the cheesecakes!"
Sara G.,"Durham, NC",87,135,54,5.0,5/23/2017,My friend and I really enjoyed our experience. Our waiter was very attentive and joked with us when we couldn't get over the calorie count they now put in both their entree and dessert menus (ignorance is bliss when it comes to cheesecake...). I enjoyed a GIGANTIC Mexican tortilla salad. I can usually conquer any restaurant salad but Cheesecake Factory salads are a different story. It was flavorful and definitely filling. I do think their entrees are fairly pricey considering they are an American food chain (i.e. $16 for a salad with some chicken in it...) but the serving size helps me to get over it. I would recommend coming here during the week to avoid long wait times because I've been here on a Saturday and it is the place to be.
Pam M.,"Raleigh, NC",7,114,4,4.0,5/14/2017,"Very wide selection of food items, and numerous options for those with dietary restrictions (e.g. gluten, dairy). Amazing atmosphere, e.g. very ornate painted ceilings. Cheesecake variety is over-the-top fantastic! The only real negative is that, since they are in the Crabtree Mall, they focus on mall traffic and therefore don't take reservations so you can wait up to 1 1/2 hours for dinner even if if you arrive at 4 pm."
Katie P.,"Zebulon, NC",26,112,20,5.0,8/13/2017,"I've been here several times, but most recently for Half Off Cheesecake Day.  The staff was handling the madhouse style rush very well, even when some jerk thoughr he was entitled to special treatment and was yelling et everyone for having to wait for his cheesecake.  My go to cheesecake flavor is Turtle, but I also love the Salted Caramel, Dove, and Red Velvet flavors.  Honestly, I've never tried a bad cheesecake from here.  Huge slices that you can really treat yourself with or be a little more modest and split with a friend. If you're coming in for dining, you really can't go wrong with any menu items.  The menu is literally a spiral bound book, and has everything from pasta to sandwiches to salads and more.  I like the Cuban sandwich, but (again) have never tried anything that wasn't super tasty."
Mickey A.,"Wilmington, NC",121,77,85,4.0,8/20/2017,"Despite the long wait, I'd say this dinner was worth the visit to the mall. The Asian lettuce wraps I had as my meal were fantastic. I was thankful that my waiter showed me a cheaper option for a portion that was just the right amount, as opposed to the build-your-own wraps that cost almost twice as much. My friend & I split a lemon raspberry cheesecake and it was absolutely perfect even when we ate it back home 2 hours later! Apparently it's always as busy as it was when I was there--I was told a 30 minute wait but it ended up being an hour. Great place but I might suggest choosing elsewhere to go if you're too hungry to want to wait!"
Olivia P.,"Raleigh, NC",16,128,284,5.0,9/8/2016,"Aaaaaah my old friend, The Cheesecake Factory. I can always count on you for a tried-and-true calorie bomb of indulgent foods and enormous portions. Visited for dinner and the food was good, as always. Service was outstanding on this visit as our server JESUS (no, that's not a typo) took great care of us throughout our meal. We ordered a kids pepperoni pizza, chicken enchiladas, cheeseburger & fries, fish tacos, and a crispy chicken sandwich. My chicken enchiladas were so good I wanted to keep eating....and eating....and eating. But I had to save room for dessert! For dessert we shared:  key lime cheesecake-tart, creamy, the perfect mix of KL pie & creamy cheesecake Smores cheesecake-sweet, gooey, and beautifully presented with roasted marshmallow and graham cracker on top Chocolate cake- extremely rich and dense, my son loved it We would visit more often if they took reservations but they don't and the wait times can be ridick, in excess of 1.5 hours on a weekend night at dinnertime. We either come for lunch or for a very early dinner (~5:30pm) and we usually only wait for about 30 minutes."
Star B.,"Raleigh, NC",6,33,69,3.0,8/20/2017,"2 people orders hamburgers (medium) , one person ordered a salad , one person bang bang chicken and one chicken and spa Gettin. Three entrees arrived but the hamburgers took 12 minutes to arrive . By then the the other foods were cool. It no one wanted to start till everyone got their food . So we were disappointed that they could not time it so we could all get the food at the same time . No apologies were given for the long wait  and the hot food getting. Old while we waited ."
Tresa W.,"Raleigh, NC",50,276,112,2.0,8/5/2017,The food is always consistent but service is horrible. No one ever checked on us to see if we wanted another drink and the busboy walked by several times looking at the ceiling and never cleaned off our table while we waited 20 mins to get our bill. Arg!! ;(
Jeannette M.,"Apex, NC",0,10,,2.0,12/26/2017,"Don't waste your time nor money. Went there on Saturday 12/26/17, waited about 10 min to be seated (not bad at all, party of 3). The waitress never came to check on us after we ordered. We waited 45 minute to get our food. The food was good, not warm-cold. So disappointed!"
Kay B.,"Kipling, NC",0,3,,3.0,11/19/2017,"Ok i went saturday night about 10pm...i loved this spot. Only problem was the floor was slippery and my shoes was sliding all over the place, surprise they dont be having allot of falls. Then i ordered a Typhoon Punch and they filled it to the top with ICE, hardly any liquor.Needs a new bartender because it wasnt even good...the food was good and they played good music."
Danny C.,"Rocky Mount, NC",35,96,147,5.0,8/20/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite places to eat in Raleigh. My wife and I have eaten here lots of times over the years. Everything is good! One of my favorite items is the lettuce wraps. I often get these and eat them as my meal. To finish it off is the cheesecake. They have numerous kinds to choose from, but I normally gravitate back to the original. No matter which one you choose, you can't go wrong."
Sasha R.,"Raleigh, NC",37,13,4,1.0,8/16/2017,"Came here about a week ago, our server had an attitude of indifference; I assume this is because she assumed my friends and i would live up to the stereotype of giving a bad tip because were teenagers. We watched our server greet her other tables in her section with enthusiasm and saw her check on them constantly, while walking by our table and barely checking on us or asking how our meal was. At the end of our meal, she sat down our checkbooks and walked off without a 'thank you' or 'have a good night'. The service was utterly disappointing.  Food was mediocre, i got the veggie burger.  Will not be back."
Michelle M.,"Phoenix, AZ",1387,232,4130,2.0,3/20/2016,"Came on a Saturday after some shopping at the mall. We arrived between 12:30-1 pm. There were groups of people in the entrance and waiting area, so I knew we would have some wait time. When I asked about the wait time for two, the Hostess said it would be about 15 minutes. Not bad with all these people standing around waiting, so I had them put my name down and they gave me a number. I should've known that it would be much longer than 15 minutes! After about 45 minutes of waiting, we went back up to ask and they told us it would be probably another 15 minutes before we were seated. I should've just left at that time, but had been craving some cheesecake. After waiting for 1  1/2 hours, we were finally seated. It didn't take our waitress long to come over and take our drink order. To keep things simple, we just asked for water with lemon.  While we went over the menu our waitress brought our water along with the complimentary bread and butter. I was starving, so I pretty much ate all the bread..lol. I decided on the Spicy chicken sandwich with the side of fries and my guest got the Factory burger and fries. We waited probably 15 minutes before our food came out. Not bad considering this place was packed!! Not sure if it was because of how busy this place was or if it's the norm here, but I didn't find the food that great. I've been to other Cheesecake Factory, but the food just didn't stand up to the quality that I'm used to back in Vegas or SoCal. My guest said their burger was very dry and the sandwich as a whole was dry and didn't have much taste to it.  After we were done eating, we just decided to order cheesecake to go. Paid for our food and left after being there for almost 4 hours. Never again will I ever go to this location on the weekends. The wait time is just so bad with all the people that come here. The best part of our visit was our waitress. She was very patient and sweet, even though she looked like she needed to go home after a long shift."
Tara W.,"Atlanta, GA",47,44,56,5.0,7/6/2017,"Excellent food, excellent service! The lobby was crowded when we arrived, but the wait was only 15 minutes, although told 30 minutes(that was great)! Location is at the Crabtree Valley Mall! I will definitely return."
Jamie M.,"Huntersville, NC",5,147,44,5.0,5/7/2016,"Truly don't think you can go wrong with anything you choose to eat here. I've been here twice & haven't left unhappy or without being stuffed! Even the lunch portions are huge! Kelly our server this time was super amazing, definitely worked for her tip!"
Denise B.,"Raleigh, NC",44,102,49,2.0,9/17/2017,"Is thus the training ground for new waitstaffs.  This place used to be excellent, now the food is mediocre.   On a Saturday afternoon we attempted to sit on porch but started to rain and no one knew what to do with us.  They took in new customers and finally sat us.  Waiter kept disappearing food was cold...track him down for check etc.  Overall terrible"
S. Elizabeth C.,"Charlotte, NC",128,75,47,5.0,5/3/2017,The food at the Cheesecake Factory is always good. We are around 3pm for a late lunch/early dinner passing through town and all of our food was good. The bartender was also very nice and we got cheesecake to go and even a day later it was great. Unfortunately the beer we were drinking needed a new tap and was a little foamy but the waiter gave us one on the house when he was fixing the tap. I totally got sprayed with beer but honestly it was just funny because the bartender was so apologetic. We will be back and definitely sit at the bar again.
David C.,"Raleigh, NC",169,25,4,4.0,4/21/2017,"Cheesecake is a go-to celebratory meal. It's a nice, clean, and consistent dining experience. There are menu choices available for every taste. Many dishes from many cultures as well as low calorie options. The meal is kind of pricey but the portion sizes are GIANT. This makes the check a bit more bearable. Nothing I've ever tried (with the exception of the cheesecake) will change your life. I've never had a meal that would make you slap yo' momma but I've never had a bad experience. This Cheesecake Factory is connected to a mall which makes waiting more bearable since this restaurant does get VERY busy. Ever since I moved to Raleigh I've loved Crabtree Valley Mall and this Cheesecake Factory location!"
Julisa G.,"Deer Park, NY",111,6,4,1.0,9/24/2017,"They ran out of the steak and when I ordered the orange chicken, the rice tasted old.  The shrimp scampi was greasy and my brothers cheese steak was steak was chewy. The waiter was wonderful though."
David S.,"Raleigh, NC",2,120,89,4.0,9/28/2016,"I went here with my family closer to closing time which is not usually our intention but GPS thought it was really close at first and we were on a deadline. Nachos came out burnt but they took it off the bill, other food came out wonderful as normal. Sorry to the staff for arriving so close to closing!"
Heather M.,"Durham, NC",107,74,1024,4.0,9/14/2017,"My daughter and I went to this restaurant for ""dessert dinner"" and was the first time either of us had been. Wow, the restaurant was gorgeous, breath takingly beautiful. Recessed ceilings with alfresco plantings, Amber scones glowed gently, giving a warm, romantic feel but the ceilings where chapel high so it made for a grand feeling. They had a lovely patio and a nice night, so we sat outside. We ordered the Godiva Chocolate, White chocolate raspberry and tirimsu cheesecakes...I don't think I ever had better cheesecake in my life! I've always wanted to just go the for a dessert date and I had a blast with my daughter. The food was pricey but perfect for a special occasion, like my birthday a week ago. I would recommended reservations, if they take them. It was packed on a regular Thursday night!! Definitely fun and worth it, if you like sweets! Located inside Crabtree Mall, there's free parking, wheel chair accessible as well as the bathrooms. Outdoor seating recommended on a nice day or night and great service"
Aly M.,"Morrisville, NC",0,10,,1.0,4/8/2017,"tl;dr The food was good, as per most Cheesecake Factories but DAMN, management/servers were extremely unprofessional dealing with scheduling. I went with a few friends on a Friday evening. It was super packed and the wait was 30-40 mins which was fine and anticipated since they don't accept reservations. Food was the standard quality that you can expect from the Cheesecake Factory.  Honestly, the service was pretty good throughout the meal, they even brought bananas and stuff out for my 2-year old (odd and unexpected but pleasant, I suppose). The service wasn't super quick but our group didn't mind because we were all chatting.  The bad part came after we had paid for our food and were on the tail end of the desserts that we had ordered. As it turned out, they were getting ready for a large party coming in. That's fine and all and we would have been happy to get up and leave IF THEY HAD TOLD US. But instead, all the servers just stood and stared. And the icing on the cake was when our server stormed past us and huffed, ""WE HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL *THEY* LEAVE!"" That, plus our server's pretty obvious fake-nice act throughout our meal plus that staged and obvious attempt at guilting us out of our seats, pushed me over the edge. So I went and spoke to the manager, just to let them know that they should have handled the situation a little bit better. Now I knew that it's not going to change anything but dang people, get your acts together.  Oh, LOL, and I guess the hostesses and servers were so unprofessional that they let one of the ladies in the big group come up to us and ask if we could leave.  Cheesecake Factory, word to the wise, you should have just explained to us the situation and we would have understood and wrapped up and left.  I know my review isn't going to change if you go there, hell, I love it so I'm still gonna go. I just won't be going to the one in Crabtree Mall anymore."
Anne M.,"Wilmington, NC",57,127,125,5.0,6/19/2016,"I remember my mom taking my sister and I to the Cheesecake factory for special occasions because it's so expensive.  Should be $$$.  In town for a meeting and stayed close by.  I recognized the brand so I stopped in for an app, salad and a beer (and a piece of cheesecake of course).  Left with a $38 tab.  I suppose you can go in and not be a glutton and leave with $20 tab.   I sat at the bar and the service was nice and so was the food.  The portions are humongous!  I took half my salad home.  What I really liked abt Cheesecake factory was that no one bothered me at the bar.  I LOATHE weird prowlers that want to know all your personal details.  I ordered the tuna tartare (super fantastic) and the chopped salad.  They have a good beer selection too.  Hoppyum IPA, yo!  If you decide to stop in and try it out, you will not be disappointed."
Lee B.,"Cary, NC",2,31,,1.0,7/15/2017,"Absolutely terrible service. 4 tables in a row got up to complain. Many went up to the manager who absolutely did nothing. Wrong orders. Many got their tab and left without ordering. My order was wrong even though I told the waiter specifically what I ordered. His reply? Well if it comes out wrong I will send it back I can't control what they do. It came out wrong. Then finally after waiting another 30 minutes I said forget it, take if off my bill. His reply? Oh it won't go to waste. So now they will eat my wrong order and I don't eat dinner. What a joke."
Kong L.,"Raleigh, NC",108,302,681,4.0,2/9/2016,Great experience and food. I always go for the Spicy Chipotle Pasta. I've had it multiple times at various cheesecake factories around the nation and the heat level is different every time. It's usually more on the sweet side at this particular location. I've had it before where it was too hot to consume.  I'm usually too full to even have dessert so it's always take out for a slice of cheesecake. The variety is amazing and is always a hit. Who comes to the cheesecake factory and goes home without a slice of cheesecake?
Mike S.,"New Bern, NC",7,7,,4.0,9/4/2017,"We ate here yesterday after a 40 minute wait. Food was pretty good with lots of fresh baked bread. The pasta had nice flavor but needed more sausage and shrimp. The caramel cheesecake had chocolate on top and was quite sweet. All in all, a good meal, but a bit pricey for a family of four. Most entrees were about $20, but a bit less if ordered off the lunch menu"
Harold J.,"Wilmington, NC",83,674,40,1.0,7/26/2017,"I would give a 0 if I could.  The last time I visited a Cheesecake Factory was four years ago and this visit reminded me again to stay away from this brand because of poor service.  This visit was no different.  I cannot comment on food or actual service because there was none.  We arrived at 6:30pm on July 25th and were seated 10 minutes later.  Now I have a rule.  If no one acknowledges us for five minutes after we sit down, I walk out.  My wife really really wanted Cheesecake so we waited 15 minuets and really got the impression(looks from staff  but no action) no one was coming.  I do not exaggerate, I was watching the time.  To my wife's disappointment and my frustration, we left our table and walked out.  I mentioned to a staff member that we were leaving and a polite reason why.  Here response was sorry and asked if we would like another table.  What was that supposed to solve?  As Yelp as my witness I will never step foot inside or spend any money at any Cheesecake location ever again.  The chain is absolute joke.  An overly large menu with a restaurant footprint that they cannot support will be their down fall.  We walked over to the next door PF Chang's and had a great dining experience and back on our way home to Wilmington.  My friends of Yelp avoid this s@#t show of a restaurant chain at all cost."
