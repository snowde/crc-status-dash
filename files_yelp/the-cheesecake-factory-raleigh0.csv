Lina M.,"San Leandro, CA",30,30,11,4.0,11/15/2013,"We love the Cheesecake Factory. Whenever were in town, got some time on our hands and are hungry. This is where we love to come and eat. Its a Factory of food, --enough said about that. The Menu goes for days and theres practically every flavor of food your taste buds desire. From America, Pan-Asian, Latin to Middle eastern flavors, of course theres also your Cajun southern flavors too. Its all there you just have to look for it in their extensive menu. On top of all of that, they have a wonderful desert menu and of course, the famous Cheesecake. Aside from cheesecake, they also have cake if your heart is set on just cake. I'm a fan of this place, it might not be for all, but i highly doubt it. Fav Apt. Thai Lettus Wraps Also, Pumpkin Pecan Cheesecake is the way during the Oct. Season, its not to pass up!"
Dinah G.,"Fayetteville, NC",15,125,189,5.0,12/12/2014,"By far, the best place for desserts. Very difficult to make a decision here with all the options. I love this place. It is a bit pricey though."
Doreen L.,"Tucson, AZ",23,259,74,5.0,6/8/2013,"Beautiful decor. Our server, Fernando, was fabulous! Large portions. Can't wait to visit the Tucson location."
Shaun B.,"St. Louis, MO",222,273,207,4.0,7/30/2013,This location has the consistent good service and food that I expect from the chain.
J M.,"Raleigh, NC",2,14,,5.0,1/31/2015,"Sunday brunch is literally, ""to die for"".  The French Toast is something of an anomaly.  Not sure how such goodness can be packed into one seating.   Would go back again...and again."
Bella R.,"Fayetteville, NC",16,49,18,5.0,11/23/2014,"Best cheesecake with so many to choose :) I suggest my favorite Jamaican shrimp and chicken! Unarguably,best  food service-food,employees and just the overall is flawless! Angela is the bartender for the best double shots ;)"
A S.,"Fuquay Varina, NC",8,57,12,1.0,9/2/2012,Walked through the doors and quickly turned around when I saw the sanitary rating of 92! Don't believe me?  Technically they have a 90 rating.
Emilee M.,"Raleigh, NC",21,18,,5.0,3/4/2015,"Delicious! The portions are huge and their cheesecake is truly good. You have a bit of a wait, but always have a good experience."
Chris N.,"Raleigh, NC",18,52,11,4.0,11/14/2012,Two words Tiramisu Cheesecake. I sure there are other cheesecakes that are good but I am so in love that I can't bring myself to cheat. To say the menu is huge is an understatement.  There are tons of dishes to choose from.  Keep in mind the portions are large.  I usually split a main dish with my wife to save room for Tiramisu cheesecake. Did I mention the Tiramisu cheesecake is good.....
Cait H.,"Cary, NC",184,292,242,2.0,5/4/2012,"The cheesecake options from any Cheesecake Factory location are delicious, dependable and totally worth it. I've never really loved eating here, and last night was the last nail in the coffin. I shan't return for dinner. Many of the cocktails are well done, but the menu doesn't make ANY sense. If you're going to have such a weird array of food genres, at least organize them a little better. It took me forever to decide on something that sounded remotely appetizing (Orange Chicken) only to find that ""brown rice"" actually means ""burnt and scraped from the bottom of the pot"". The chicken was sickeningly sweet and I really didn't eat any of this meal. Unfortunate really - especially for the price. That being said, the Chocolate Mousse Cheesecake and the Red Velvet Cheesecake are both pure heaven. Just get dessert to-go."
Leslie C.,"Cary, NC",54,34,4,4.0,4/11/2012,"I want to scrunch my nose up at the insanity that is The Cheesecake Factory...but, I can't. Every dish I have ordered has been great and on point.   The food is not 5 star chef complexity and quality, but it is delicious and solidly so. The available menu options is ridiculous. I'm pretty sure it's twenty pages long before dessert. Their cheesecakes are to die for, my personal favorite is the pineapple upside down cheesecake."
Justin P.,"Cary, NC",25,81,,4.0,12/22/2012,"I had always heard that The Cheesecake Factory was super popular, but I didn't realize how popular it was until when I actually went. It was 6:00 at the Cheesecake Factory on Glenwood Avenue. There are two entrances to the restaurant and people were just waiting in both entrances. My most helpful tip for newcomers: GET HERE FAST AND PUT YOUR NAME IN FAST!!!!  When we eventually got a table, I took a look at the menu. The lines aren't the only big things at The Cheesecake Factory. The menu is huge! There are probably 10 pages (not including ads) of food, drinks, and cheesecake! The menu is also a little weird. I wouldn't expect Shepard's Pie, Orange Chicken, and Bang Bang Chicken to be on the same menu, but at the Cheesecake Factory, that is the case. I ordered the chicken di pana. It is lightly breaded chicken breast served over a white wine butter sauce with mashed potatoes and broccoli. Here is what I received: 2 GIANT chicken breasts, 4 broccoli florets, and possibly 5 giant scoops of mashed potatoes. Portion sizes are huge. I'm glad I don't come here too often. Everything at the Cheesecake Factory tastes good. The chicken was cooked perfectly and the mashed potatoes were scrumptious. Surprisingly, the Shepard's Pie is delicious. I would definitely recommend the pork chop too.  You can't come to the Cheesecake Factory without their cheesecake. Their cheesecakes are amazing, all of them. Just make sure that you have room for it though. Cheesecake Factory is good and it will be the place to go when I'm starving!"
Andy N.,"Angier, NC",27,27,25,3.0,7/24/2013,"This place is ""alright"" Its way more hyped up than it should be. The cheese cakes are amazing but the seating and meals are very small to none. It's quite pricy but it's nice and the ambiance is pretty weird. Egyptian themed restaurant, wasn't really expecting that."
Dee W.,"Evanston, IL",187,1570,1299,4.0,1/31/2013,"With a small group, we were told that there would be an hour wait for a table so we opted to pop next door instead while we waited since the bar area was packed on a Saturday night.  By the time we came back, we ended up just ordering cheesecake at the station and then, headed over to the bar for drinks. The bartender was fantastic - he noticed that we had a thing for olives so he ended up just bringing over a plate full of olives for us.  Talk about paying attention to your customer!"
Miss V.,"Dallas, TX",5,99,20,4.0,1/28/2012,"This place is a favorite between me and my boyfriend. It's the only place I've ever seen him order a salad, and that being said, it's one of the rare places I will order a salad either because they are typically huge, and have a whole lot of toppings that make it very filling. A few things: 1. Sometimes, the salads are made a little bit differently depending on who's the chef, which means occasionally the salads are smaller than normal, or forgot an ingredient. The servers are awesome though and typically fix what they can although when we've gotten a much smaller salad neither one of us has wanted to be the piggie that exclaimed, ""hey! MORE salad in my trough! Don't be stingy!""  I mean, they already give us two baskets of the dark bread.  2. If you get something to go, I've noticed that the to-go portions are smaller than the in-house portions. (are you noticing a trend?) I mention this because typically the salads we get are two meals worth, so when we're paying $14-16 for a salad, we like to stretch it out. 3. I can't say I've ever had anything bad here. Get creative. I typically get the pear and endive salad, and add goat cheese and beets in lieu of chicken (there's sometimes an extra charge for the cheese.) Boyfriend digs the Southwestern (or is it the Barbeque Chicken?) I'm not a big fan of their veggie burger, but I have played around with another burger and had it on their fry bread, which is messy but delicious.  4. I've ordered several of their slices of cheesecake, and while they're solid, they're not so melt-my-little-grinchy-heart that I'm willing to shell out $7 for them except when I'm feeling especially magnanimous with my stomach.  5. Oh, and their tropical iced tea is really good and enough to make me want to go there tomorrow.  6. This place might not be the best for people with hearing aids. There's most often a din of some sort, which makes it great if you're needing a public place to trade nuclear armament design upgrades, but not so great if you've had a really tough day and don't want to be surrounded by the happy, materialistic cacophony of the Mall. p.s. Dear Waitstaff-- you all rock my socks off. At all of the Cheesecake Factories I've been to in several states, I've only had the rare off night with a server and never at this one. These guys and gals are professional, warm, and for the most part efficient (c'mon, they can't control the kitchen) with presenting the food or keeping stomach grumbles to a minimum with bread and refills. Don't forget to TIP your waitstaff commensurate with the appreciation you had at having fine service."
Mai O.,"Philadelphia, PA",1,6,5,3.0,9/21/2015,"I finally went back to Cheesecake Factory when I was celebrating my sisters birthday this past weekend. I had been dying to go back bc I love me some Cheesecake Factory. My whole family party was about 10 and our wait was about 45 min on a Sunday evening which was fine. We were seated and we told our server that it was my sisters birthday so that they could do something for her. So we ordered and the food came in just in time since the bread was going fast and we had gotten to our second baskets of bread. What is it about their bread and butter?! Haha so good. Since the portions are so big a few of us shared dishes so that was perfect because we finished it. Soon after our plates were picked up we asked the waiter to already do the birthday thing so we could sing my sister happy birthday and give her her cards and present. However she did not do anything yet. We waited and she was nowhere to be found. We ended up just giving my sister her cards and gifts bc it was already a while. And we finally placed our dessert order bc she told us they can't do a birthday special thing for her unless we ordered dessert. I was shocked. It ruined the rest of our what happened to be a perfect dinner celebration. They finally sang happy birthday when the cheesecake came out but the night was basically ruined. On top of that after singing the song (which normally the bday celebrant blows the candle and makes a wish) she interrupted the moment to ask if we need anything else. It was just all kinds of wrong after that. So all in all the food and overall service was great but that last part was not. I can't remember a place that doesn't do something special for birthday occasions without needing a dessert order. I just didn't feel it make sense. Just this past May my family came to this restaurant for my mothers birthday to which they sang at the right time and gave my mom a free bday cake(I was not there). The server ruined the 2 stars for me, which could've been 5 stars. Sorry. Her name was Lindsey C."
Daniel M.,"Cary, NC",42,23,3,5.0,1/18/2012,"I've waited so long to review this place but that's because I am just not excited to review it!  I just don't think reviewing chain restaurants is as important as reviewing small businesses.  But, Yelp keeps flashing this check-in and asking me to review it so here goes.... This place is amazing!  If you haven't been to a Cheescake Factory yet I can't understand why.  I mean, they are everywhere, aren't they?   The food is absolutely delicious!  The menu could take 20 minutes to go through, they have everything. For me, spicy ahi tempura roll as an appetizer and the chicken medeira as an entree.  There is enough food here to split with your significant other (if you are not trying to eat to exhaustion) and you will still have room for any of the huge selection one-of-a-kind delicious cheesecakes!  If you like fruity adult beverages, they have a huge selection here as well. Now for the kids - the kids menu offers sliders and chicken fingers and mac & cheese and a couple other items.  It is reasonably priced and has enough food for a growing boy.  You can get a ice cream sundae for $1 more and it's enough ice cream to give your kids stomach aches (not that you'd want to, my point is it's a lot of ice cream).   The service is great!  The place ambiance is great!  The food is great! The only draw back is the huge line and wait to get a table.   I almost forgot, GO GET BRUNCH HERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Monte Cristo ftw!  Mimosas for the ladies!"
David S.,"Winston Salem, NC",2,7,1,2.0,8/24/2014,Service  lacking  food mediocre and overpriced  ambience  is loud and cheesy  great way to waste 100$
Mary L.,"Raleigh, NC",0,8,,2.0,11/16/2014,"Cheesecake is their specialty?  I can make better cheesecake....  I got the pumpkin cheesecake and found it to be ""fluffy"" like whipped cream pie, not dense and creamy. And at that price, I was quite disappointed.  My salad was also over-priced.  My server, named Shannon, was not pleasant, and actually quite whiney.  Strike 3, you're out. I won't be back."
Katherine S.,"Raleigh, NC",47,2,,5.0,1/11/2012,"My review is a little biased, as anything that has to do with cheesecake is okay in my book, but the Cheesecake Factory is one of the few fancier restaurants that has never failed to please me. I don't go enough to consider myself a regular, but I have been dining here since it first opened. I stopped in last week for lunch with a friend and was seated right away- an uncommon occurance, I realize. The hostess was consciencious of my daughter (who was in her stoller), and our server was amazing. If I could remembe his name I would totally give him a shout out. I ordered the Santa Fe salad, which was delicious, and a large enough portion that it lasted me through lunch AND take home for dinner. All in all, this is one of my favorite places! Oh, and their cheesecakes are pretty damn good too."
