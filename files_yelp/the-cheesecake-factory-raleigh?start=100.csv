Erica J.,"Raleigh, NC",0,2,,2.0,9/24/2016,"We called to order carryout at 7:42 PM. The second time I called, they answered after about 45 seconds of the phone ringing, then left me on wait for three minutes. I ordered, and they told me my food would be ready in 20-25 minutes. We arrived between 8:05 and 8:10 and our food was not ready. Shortly after 8:25 we were handed *most* of our order and got to wait another five minutes for the rest. We left at 8:30 - our food too 50 minutes, or fully twice as long, as we were told. Furthermore, we were not the only ones with this issue - while paying, another guest was having a tense conversation with a manager about having waited for a carryout order for an hour. It seems like they should have had a more realistic idea how long the food would take to prepare. It was a clumsily-handled experience. But the food was okay."
Joey R.,"Apex, NC",51,10,,1.0,9/22/2016,Kinda ridiculous to wait so long and they charge 22 dollars for 3 beef nuggets. I prefer people who give quality service as well as food. Will never go to this place again. Then to top it off the mashed potatoes were very cold and tasted very old.
Heather M.,"Rockville, MD",122,247,815,3.0,11/18/2014,"This is proof that sometimes I pick my dinner spot based on what they have to offer for dessert. Their menu is literally a booklet. I try to get a new entree/appetizer every time I'm there. Everything is tasty, but also pretty oily too. I would highly recommend their chinese chicken salad! I don't like to eat my veggies but this ones really tasty. I don't know how ""healthy"" it is but I promise it's yummy and filling. Their cheesecakes are unbelievably delicious and creamy. They are also very heavy so the whole ""sharing is caring"" motto is definitely applicable here. My favorite so far has been the white chocolate macadamia cheesecake- give it a try! Seating isn't very intimate. What kind of sucks is that you can hear the conversations of other groups. It's always loud and crowded. This cheesecake factory typically has a shorter wait than the one at Southpoint!"
Marie T.,"Raleigh, NC",28,172,48,4.0,1/15/2017,"The one thing you can count on with The Cheesecake Factory is consistency across the board, which helps when you're going to dine with really picky eaters. I feel there are enough amazing restaurants in the Triangle area to avoid chains, but if you're going to go to a chain, The Cheesecake Factory is a good bet. Their menu selection literally has something for everyone (for which I am eternally grateful for when dining with really picky people). Their coffee is solid, too. As far as desserts go (because let's be honest, dessert is the best course), their carrot cake is off the chain. I would seriously drive out of my way for their carrot cake. It is amazing!!!  Best carrot cake I've ever had, and I'm quite the travelled carrot cake eater. Their cheesecakes are all relatively solid (the red velvet is to die for!). Their strawberry shortcake dessert is unfortunately majorly lacking. Avoid this menu item...it's like chewing balloons with sugary sauce mixed in. On to the food! With the varied selection, obviously some things will be better than others because you can't do everything great, but all the entrees I've tried have been pretty solid. The shepherds pie can sometimes fall on the salty side when the kitchen is rushed, the corn fritters are the bomb, the pastas are always pretty good, and the little flatbread pizzas are wonderful. Service is a definite hit or miss. Some servers are excellent at this location and other servers appear to hate their job, the restaurant, and every patron that comes across their table. That's to be expected when a restaurant is this large and the price point is where it is. Unfortunately, due to the proximity to the mall, you can get some larger groups of kids hanging around just ordering drinks and one slice of cheesecake, which I'm sure does nothing to improve the server's mood. Best deal: get your Cheesecake to go and enjoy it in the peace of your own home."
Khing T.,"Raleigh, NC",0,7,1,1.0,2/19/2017,We family of 4 been  comming this location for years.  We always love the food and the ambient here.  Last time we came in here early around 3 or 4pm so it was still bright for us to caught a piece of metal silver string from the ball scrubber in our food.  We called the waitress to show her.  She promptly took the dish in and the manager came out promised the replacement will arrive soon and they did.  Tonight we ordered our food and waited about 45 min then the chief came out 3 entrees and missing one. I have to reorder caused the chief dropped my food on the kitchen floor. I understand and wait for my food while my family finished their meals. I talked to my wife that will they offer me a free meal for the wait. My wife said wish me a good luck  from them. Finally my food  came out I then ate some the packed to go cause too late to eat full. When my wife look the bill she laughing and said don't  expect for their free meal just because they making us wait.  She mentioned last time even we found a piece of metal string from scrubber in our food they didn't event take off that dish from the bill.  We even left 20% tip each time. After tonight we won't come in back here anymore. There is the new one J' Alexander is better.
Kris S.,"Fernandina Beach, FL",94,161,132,4.0,7/28/2015,"Yep- Lots of food here. Figure that with the box of leftovers your are getting 2 meals for the price of 1. Kelly, our server, was a great help since 2 of our party have special needs (we're sort of a wheelchair crowd,) and she had some good tips about what was good on the menu. Of course the main reason for going is the CHEESECAKE!!!  Everything is just lead up to desert.  And yes, the cheesecake is quite tasty. I went for chocolate and took at least half of it home since it's too rich to eat all at once. Saturday at 1 in the afternoon was crowded with a 1/2 hour wait minimum."
Ophelia D.,"Jamestown, NC",0,3,,3.0,3/12/2017,"I enjoyed the food as always. But the service I received initially walking in was not up to par. The hostess in charge of seating us was too distracted with talking to her coworker( not about the job) to even get the name of our party right, even though we spelt it to her twice. The rest of our experience was pleasant. As someone who is first to interact with customers a hostess should be kind and attentive. I expected better of the Cheesecakes Factory."
Amanda S.,"Franklinton, NC",47,19,1,3.0,9/7/2016,"I went here with my family on a Sunday afternoon for my birthday and it was ridiculous..but honestly i'm sure they've had better days and worse days cause I had to wait almost and hour to be seated, but I already expected it to be busy so we waited...The food of course like everything else was slow because I can imagine all the orders coming in with that much people, so understandable. The food was good so the wait was definitely worth it, but it is very expensive."
Michael B.,"Johnson City, TN",19,232,246,3.0,8/17/2015,"Three stars is taking into account quality with value. Not a bad experience, and one I'd do again, but not one I'm in a hurry to get back to considering the myriad of other great restaurants Raleigh has to offer. My friend had a craving for Cheesecake Factory, so I figured what the hey, since I'd been years ago in Charlotte and thought it was ok. The wait on a Sunday evening was about 20 minutes around 6 PM. Service was fast and friendly, so no points off there. The seared tuna tataki salad was pretty good. Fresh ginger, ripe avocado, and tuna were delicious, not to mention a high point in a menu not friendly to the calorie-conscious. (I did not save room for dessert, sadly). If I had to name a downside, is that this dish, with an unsweetened tea, cost over $21 bucks (not including tip) and had to wait 20 minutes for. Though what I ordered was perfectly fine, I definitely knew I was paying more for decor/the franchise/etc, which is typical for more upscale chains like Maggiano's, California Pizza Kitchen, and Cheesecake Factory. rather than a novel culinary experience. Again, so many other great restaurants around Raleigh that offer more bang for the buck. Nonetheless, pretty good food if you're willing to pay and wait, and of course, a phenomenal selection of cheesecakes (the quality of which I cannot comment on since I passed)."
Nate P.,"Raleigh, NC",59,55,1,2.0,9/17/2015,"Got the factory meatloaf to go , slathered in an extremely  salty mushroom gravy it simply overwhelmed the taste of the meatloaf - sadly the mashed potatos were drenched in the same gravy , I guess I could have requested no gravy and had I known I certainly would have .   The take out cashier set up seems rather unorganized as well , usually enjoy my cheesecake visits , not so much this time . Will try again ,different entree tho ."
Kevin P.,"Raleigh, NC",114,126,47,4.0,5/28/2015,"It's the Cheesecake Factory, so it's a chain, and this one is like others, which can be a very good thing. I remember when I was a teenager and couldn't afford to eat here. Sometimes it's just nice to enjoy good food in a really pristine setting...and really the interior design and quality... How many times have you floated off staring at their ceilings and murals? How many times? It's really great design, the cheesecake really is outstanding (Godiva Chocolate is a winner), the food is never bad and almost always above average. Is there great food? Yeah there is but it changes over time, so the Sunday Brunch Crab Hash is no where near where it used to be. Still, if I could bet on a place I could go and have good food and a good experience at any given time, Cheesecake Factory would be at the top of my list. More suggestions? Bad Penny on draft  Wings Shrimp Bistro Pasta Buffalo Blasts (this actually a great place for beer and wings) Best tip? If there's a long wait, because there usually is, walk through the bar area to find tables - it's open seating so no wait is needed."
Megan C.,"Hilton Head Island, SC",40,3,,2.0,8/1/2016,"Table unclean, mean management. Waiter judgmental. Nice to everyone but us. Feeling very rushed."
Jessica R.,"Raleigh, NC",1,5,,1.0,2/21/2016,"Let's just start with saying if I could do NO STARS I would. This has by far been the worst experience at any restaurant that I have ever been to. We walked into the Cheesecake Factory at 8:17 p.m. on Sunday February 21st. We were immediately greeted by a very kind gentleman in a blue shirt (who we thought was the manager) and the hostess. We put our name in for three people and were told that we had a fifteen minute wait. That was completely fine. When we were finally seated (which was not in the fifteen minute wait mark) we were greeted by our waitress. After all our food was ordered and brought to the table (which took 45 minutes!) my fiance had noticed that something he had specifically ordered not to have was on his food. Because of his allergy the food was sent back. In the meantime of waiting for his meal, my friend and I have completely finished ours. By the time we were ready for our checks our waitress mentioned the manager (who we HAVE NOT seen all night long) was offering us free cheesecake. We decided we didn't want to take advantage and asked to just speak to the manager to explain our situation. When the manager came over and introduced himself is when the REAL problem occurred!! The manager's name was PHIL. The second he came to our table there was instantly a rude vibe coming off from him. He asked us what our problem was and as we started to describe it he interrupted us with a sarcastic remark about the ""timing"" and continued with saying our problems were in fact not really problems. Phil then apparently decided he was done hearing us and stood up and said ""WHATEVER THE FOODS ON ME."" We were in COMPLETE shock. I have NEVER in my life been so disrespected EVER. To end my rant of this awfully managed restaurant I will leave you with DO NOT EAT HERE! I will never take my service to this restaurant ever again. Terrible terrible terrible management!"
Dahlia M.,"Apex, NC",0,9,,5.0,7/26/2016,"This place is one of the only chain restaurants I eat at.  My son and I had the hibachi steak, medium rare.  It was tender and cooked to perfection.  He had the Reese's peanut butter cheesecake and I had the chocolate mousse cheesecake.  So much wonderful!  Our server's name was Robin, great at what she does.  She had the help of some other really terrific staff members, and we go regularly to enjoy this kind of food and service."
Beth Q.,"Wilmington, NC",1,5,13,5.0,5/5/2015,"Always satisfied. I love all their food but came just for the cheesecake this time :) we got three slices to share- Adams peanut butter ripple, Oreo Dream, and S'mores Galore. You can't go wrong with any of them because they all are amazing! Another favorite of mine is the Khalua coffee cheesecake"
Abhishek S.,"Raleigh, NC",0,6,,5.0,7/16/2016,"This place is always awesome.The food quality is excellent,the service is flawless and the resturant itself is besutiful."
Cindy G.,"Apex, NC",144,518,2696,4.0,8/8/2014,"Had Saturday lunch here. Expect to wait, very busy and tables are close to one another. Huge selection on the menu, and of course, tons of cheescake options. I really liked their salad, very fresh with just enough dressing. Big portions. Server was attentive and friendly."
Adam O.,"Clayton, NC",0,8,2,1.0,12/14/2016,What a waste of time. First off they don't take reservations then they get ill and give you attitude when you are paged on their system to be seated and your whole party is not present. Manager is a jerk and condescending. Acting like he went above and beyond to seat myself before the other members of the party arrived. Last time I checked dinning in this establishment was a choice. I chose to spend my money at your location. There are other places that are more worth the money that treat you like individuals and not like some cattle at a feeding trough where you inconvenience them. At least the waitress had a great disposition.
Yeshanth J.,"Cary, NC",30,231,155,1.0,3/30/2015,"Not impressed with the line management when ordering just the cheesecake. The ladies behind the counter have an air of arrogance. I was made to wait in the line while they decided to get done with their backlogs.  For reviews on the food, see the one I reviewed for Durham. Bottomline : I am better off with the one in Durham."
Shteve J.,"Raleigh, NC",29,5,3,3.0,12/24/2015,"I had an expected long wait to be seated here given that it is Christmas Eve. The food was up to par with my professional food critic standards. I ordered a Bacon Bacon cheeseburger which reminded me of a old German saying ""Tod den Ungläubigen !! Die Achse wird steigen!"" Which roughly translates to ""once you take a bit you will be lost in a heavenly Trifecta and ultimately reach a state of enlightenment."" There was one problem though, we found a wing nut in my sisters salad! Like an actual wing nut! And a big one! If she didn't see it before she tried to eat her salad and bit down on it she would have succumb to instant death by wing nut. That is a serious problem these days, wing nuts kill thousand! So yes the food and service was great here but just watch out for those wing nuts they can kill you faster then you can say ""Oh no I'm about to eat a wing nut!!"""
