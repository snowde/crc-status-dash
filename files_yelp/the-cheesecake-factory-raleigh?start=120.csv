Sarah B.,"Syracuse, NY",0,14,,5.0,12/18/2015,"I've never had complaints here. Only minor mishaps by staff but understandably so due to high occupancy and such incidents were quickly corrected. Great waiters/waitresses (both, helpful and knowledgeable.) you get what you pay for!  Love it!"
Michael H.,"Wake Forest, NC",15,257,1,5.0,7/10/2015,Great GF options.  Ordered corn tamales app today for a quick snack.  Going back for the GF chocolate cheesecake. Knowledge staff when it comes to food allergies.
Chris T.,"Fuquay-Varina, NC",150,139,39,3.0,7/31/2015,"Been here a couple of dozen times now trying several different entrees and appetizers. The food, service & price are both good. A little boring and pretentious with a long wait during peak hours... It's good but not worth a wait. Will we go back? Probably not with too many other options that are as good or better with less of a wait."
Tamula-Jean V.,"Raleigh, NC",4,9,3,5.0,1/4/2016,"I really love this place!  My husband and I had our first date here, and we've been going there for the past 7 years!  The food is great, prices are reasonable, the bartender recognizes us every year, and the wait staff is very attentive.  I would highly recommend this place for any occasion, and especially for special occasions."
Jackie K.,"Spanaway, WA",34,80,155,5.0,4/3/2015,"For being busy on a holiday weekend service was excellent! Tried the crab bites for appetizers, had the herb crusted salmon with asparagus and mashed potatoes for the main coarse, and an Oreo cookies cheesecake slice which was AMAZING! Got the cookie dough cheesecake slice to go too! Our waiter was on top of refilling drinks and getting our food to us so quickly. Will be coming here again."
Heather K.,"Raleigh, NC",0,3,,3.0,12/13/2016,I had an unsatisfying lunch at the Cheesecake Factory in Crabtree Valley Mall on Monday 12/12/16. The first three menu items I tried to order were unavailable. I then ordered  the lunch special of a small pizza and a half salad. I ordered the salad with no tomatoes and they brought me a bowl of only lettuce and vinaigrette. Very disappointing!
Becka W.,"Greensboro, NC",2,26,22,3.0,5/1/2016,"One of my favorite chain restaurants to date. Typically, whichever location I visit, the service and food is consistent. A little disappointed with the to-go at this location however. I called my order in and was quoted a 20 minute wait time. It's going on 40 minutes now and I'm still standing here amongst the crowd of people waiting. I see there's two cash registers at the counter, however, only one person is ringing up orders and bagging. In addition to that, there are employees standing at the end of the counter chit chatting and laughing. Not a very efficient use of equipment or labor.  Having been in the management aspect of the food service industry for many years, I can say that utilizing one of those ""stand arounders"", either having them man the register or as a runner bringing out orders, would help significantly increase the wait time."
Joel T.,"Greenville, NC",2,2,,1.0,2/26/2016,"Worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant. The manager was the most disrespectful person, the food was cold and the wait was outrageous."
Alan M.,"Raleigh, NC",308,310,81,4.0,5/31/2015,I have never been a fan maybe I have not ordered the right food tonight I ordered chicken piccata it featured perfectly cooked chicken in a lemon caper sauce and angel hair pasta it was delicious would definitely order again we sat at the bar to avoid the line on a Saturday night service was ok but then we decided to order cheesecake to go at counter for an off night service was slow and a long wait
M S.,"Rocky Mount, NC",12,15,3,2.0,3/28/2014,Here now. Server change during my meal. I am dining alone. The server called out to me on my way to the bathroom. Maybe she thought I was leaving without paying.  My meal never came. 2 tables beside me were served. I was offered a check (:  My drink order was incorrect. My food order was incorrect when they FINALLY put it in! Still waiting for a refill... Not a good day. Last time wasn't great either.  Maybe I will give them a third chance. No complaints about food. Service always suck!
Coley F.,"Raleigh, NC",0,18,,2.0,4/30/2016,"This review is based solely on our experience of ordering cheesecake to go.   We ate dinner elsewhere in the mall and headed to the Cheesecake factory to buy 2 slices of cheesecake to go.  We arrived at 5:45.  The entire entrance and lobby were full of people.    We headed straight for the cheesecake counter and got in line.  Short story: we didn't leave until 6:15 (a full 30 minutes). Long story:  Their system is inefficient and chaotic.  They are preparing to-go dessert and dine-in dessert orders all in the same small space.  Once you get through the line and finally order (and pay), you don't really realize you're in for such a long wait.  The cashier asks for your name, which they'll call out once your order is ready.  However, the lobby is super crowded, and there were dozens of other people waiting for their to-go cheesecakes.  As such, its hard to get close enough to hear your name.  Regardless, waiting for anything more than 5 minutes is unacceptable.  The cheesecake is good, but its not the best dessert in Raleigh. I'd never wait that long again.  If we hadn't already paid ($17 plus tip for 2 slices), we would have left.  But of course, once you pay, you're stuck waiting.  It's not like you could even make it back to the register to ask for a refund without waiting in line for 10 minutes all over again.   Another note: people in the lobby commented that they'd been waiting for 60-90 minutes.  That means these people had been waiting since 4:30 or 5, which I would have thought was a ""safe"" time to expect little-to-no wait."
Barry D.,"Raleigh, NC",0,25,,3.0,5/26/2016,"My favorite dish here (or just about anywhere) is the Bang Bang Chicken and shrimp, but anything I've had here is good. Portions are huge (and should be for the price) but no matter when you go, you will have to wait between 15 minutes and hours for a table. If this restaurant were closer, parking was more available, and it was less crowded, I'd go much more often. There have been many times we went here only to find no parking and/or an extremely long wait time, so usually we just don't go anymore except when I have that extra-special craving for my favorite dish and am willing to wait to be seated. Since it's always so crowded, servers tend to be overworked and you  won't be able to easily flag down your server for soda refills or whatever. Why don't they open another one in Wake Forest ? (the one in Southpoint is just as crowded.) So, even if this is close to being my favorite restaurant, I can't give it more than three stars."
Amanda B.,"Raleigh, NC",1,11,,1.0,1/22/2015,"I had dinner here tonight, and it was just all around horrific.  From the classy couple arguing in the vestibule upon entering, to the rude waiter, to the cops being called for some sort of credit card theft-- I don't know where to begin. The server acted like he was in a huge rush from the moment we were seated. He didn't really care about providing any kind of hospitality, approachability, or genuine service. We may as well have been cattle waiting for our number. The dish I originally wanted was vaguely ""not available"" tonight. I guess they had to wait to finish harvesting their own mushrooms from the garden out back? Or perhaps fermenting their own handcrafted fontina cheese? There's really a plethora of things that could prevent stuffed mushrooms from being a ""thing"" any given night. This whole experience was a disaster, but I suppose that should be expected when dining at a chain restaurant that operates out of a shopping mall. Lesson learned."
Destiny C.,"Raleigh, NC",0,5,1,3.0,11/4/2016,"I have been here quite a few times and ordered something different each time but the food always tastes bland.  The waiting times are also ridiculous, I only suggest coming here for the cheesecake obviously."
Heather G.,"Minneapolis, MN",763,400,205,3.0,7/1/2013,"I went to Cheesecake Factory for dessert.  Not because I wanted to, but because my friends are in love with this place.  I asked the waiter if he could cut my slice of cheesecake into two (so I could take half of it home).  My waiter told me, ""No.""  I paused, because I was trying to see if he was joking or not.  He was not joking.  I proceeded to ask him ""Why not?"" He stated the cheesecake cutter  would not cut the cheesecake in half because that would ruin the presentation.  WHAT?! He offered to bring me a knife so I could cut it myself.  Instead of flipping tables over in CF, I calmly asked the waiter to ask the Cheesecake cutter to slice my cake and not to come back without my cake in two. He obliged and the world was a peace. Lawd, why do these folks try to test my patience??"
Kelly M.,"Raleigh, NC",143,109,184,3.0,3/28/2014,"This review is strictly for happy hour!  Cheesecake has a surprisingly good happy hour appetizer selection. Tons of stuff for $5 - avocado eggrolls, nachos, tex mex eggrolls, sliders, etc. Huge portions of food - we met here for two appetizers at 5 to split and ended up skipping dinner we were still so full. I think some Cheesecake locations offer $5 cocktails during happy hour, but of course you can't do that in NC. Wine/cocktails were slightly pricey - I ordered a pineapple moscow mule and it was a great drink but I think it cost me $10. House wine started at $8.50. Two apps, two cocktails = $31.25. Full disclosure, we only come here when someone gives us a giftcard, but we're ex-PF Changs employees, so we're a little jaded on the mall chain restaurants.  Great central location for meeting a friend for happy hour!"
Merala J.,"Fayetteville, NC",24,31,,4.0,5/17/2016,Very beautiful establishment. The people were not the most friendliest. The cheesecakes were beyond my expectations. I definitely will be trying them again in the near future.
Grant G.,"Raleigh, NC",2,71,2,4.0,2/7/2016,"This place is huge, with sports arena ceilings, a long bar and multiple seating areas. If you're looking for an intimate dining experience, this ISN'T the place for you, but if you're looking for almost any kind of food, this IS the place for you. The menu is endless, so you may want to check it out online before you go so you don't spend 20 years combing through it in the restaurant. I had chicken picata and it was excellent. Prices were reasonable although I wish they had some lower cost wines by the glass options. We went on a Saturday night and the wait time was an hour and a half to two hours, so you may want to get your name on the list and do some shopping while you wait - or go on another night.If you're looking for a place that has almost everything on their menu, serves large portions and offers them at a reasonable price, this is the place for you. If you're turned off by crowds you may need to skip it, or at the very least go during a weeknight."
Daniel Z.,"Raleigh, NC",12,22,17,2.0,11/10/2015,"The 2hrs and 45min dilemma!!! We got there at 6:30. We're seated at 6:55, we were ready to order at 7, and ignored till :15, ordered at 7:20, We got our food at 8:00-8:10ish ( ~3 minute increments between the four people per plate) , due to the combination of an inattentive server(Joseph)  and being out of the turkey burger, he gave me the menu back and checked in with me 15 minutes later, that is unacceptable. I went to talk to a manager (Phil) whom for the time being got things straightened out and we got a new server (Bridget) who was attentive for the first 2 encounters, then forgot about us, I then asked a random (Hilarious) server for Phil again, ordered our desert with him, and finally got it. I'm now leaving the restaurant, it's 9:15 making my total stay 2hrs and 45min I've been living in this area for 14 years. Have been her many times, this is the worst experience I've ever had. thank you Phil for helping as much as you could."
Kent W.,"Raleigh, NC",2,12,,1.0,11/8/2014,Attempted to have lunch here with the wife.  We were seated and after 15 minutes with no server I stopped someone asked. He apologized and took our order even though he said he wasn't our server.  Skip ahead and 40 minutes later we still had no bread and no entrees.  I yet again had to stop someone who went and got the manager at my request. After speaking to the manager it was uncovered that our order was never put in.  We wasted over an hour of our life's here and got nothing to eat.  We ended leaving to go to another restaurant.  Needless to say their service is terrible and their servers are desperate need of some training.
