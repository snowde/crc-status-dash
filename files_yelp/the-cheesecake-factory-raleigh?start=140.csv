Danielle R.,"Greensboro, NC",46,381,145,5.0,9/12/2013,"I love the Cheesecake Factory! I also live the fact that they are consistent in good service and great food no matter whichever location I go to.  Service was spot on as usual on this trip. I ordered the Thai chicken lettuce wraps and they were yum-my! I keep telling myself I'll get something different but those wraps are so good they sucker me in every time. Even though they're on the appetizer menu, there's enough for two meals, or a meal to split with someone else. Of course, I walked out with cheesecake in hand because its a sin to to eat at the Cheesecake Factory and NOT eat cheesecake! I ordered the Oreo Dream cheesecake, s'mores cheesecake, and lemon torte. While I didn't eat them all (you didn't think they were all for me did you?), I did try them all. The Oreo was a little overkill but perfect for my teenager. The s'mores was simple and sweet. The lemon torte was absolutely fabulous and even though it wasn't cheesecake, I'd be sure to get it again!"
Nelson B.,"Raleigh, NC",0,1,,1.0,6/19/2016,I guess being a huge franchise means customer service is inconsequential. Huevos Rancheros served cold for Father's Day - sent back and replacement dish took more than 20 minutes; wife was way done with her entree.  Acted like it was a favor to take off the bill.  Pathetic.  Plenty of better options; pick any....
Kristi M.,"New York, NY",5,79,3,4.0,11/6/2015,"There was a little bit of a wait for lunch, but this chain tends to stay busy. Our server was Hillary and she was so nice and friendly. The alfredo pasta was tasty, but I ordered it with chicken and there were less than five pieces. I expected a little more even though it was the lunch portion. The cheesecake was good, but their tiramisu lacks something. It's bland and the cream filling could be better. Authentic tiramisu has liquor on the bottom layer and this has none. Seek good tiramisu elsewhere, but overall this was a good dining experience."
Christopher C.,"Gaithersburg, MD",6,72,195,1.0,8/26/2014,"I have always enjoyed the food at the Cheesecake Factory - most recently the Greek salad has become a favorite with the Teriyaki Chicken and the Pepperoni Pizza. Of course I love the desserts!  The reason a 3.5 star establishment gets 1 star is the absurd corporate policy of sending out kids menu food on plates to hot to the touch. Why they cannot simply plate on regular plates is beyond me. Every time we are there with our kids, we have to send their orders back to be re-plated. As long as this continues to be corporate policy at the Cheesecake Factory, I will give everyone I eat at 1 star reviews despite the level of the service."
Beth R.,"Raleigh, NC",31,69,2,3.0,3/7/2016,"Mediocre, at best. Very long wait times coupled with extremely long wait times for food. Do not attempt to edit your food from the way it is listed on the menu as it will come out completely messed up. The only reason it gets 3 stars is simply because I love the food and the huge variety to chose from!"
Lois D.,"Raleigh, NC",17,48,61,4.0,12/29/2013,Been here a few times.  My Chinese chicken salad was scrumptious.   Lunch menu and portions are not too pricey.  Too full this time to order dessert.  This last time we were seated at a table in the bar which was practically in the lobby/waiting area :(.  Other times our table was always in the restaurant.
Todd T.,"Raleigh, NC",6,13,26,4.0,12/29/2013,"Excellent Food and Service! We were told our wait would be 45 min., but it only ended up being approximately 30 min.  My crew and I started with the Avocado Egg Rolls. We highly recommend them. Our Entrees were the Shrimp/Chicken Gumbo w/ Brown Rice, the Club Sandwich, and the BBQ Chicken Salad. All were thumbs up. For our desserts, we selected two Cheescakes: Toasted Marshmallow S'Mores Galore and the Oreo. These along with Coffee tapped off a great evening with the Family."
Noemi B.,"Brooklyn, NY",12,24,31,5.0,8/12/2014,"We waited about half an hour on a Friday early evening. We decided to shop through the mall as we waited. Considering it was crowded we were attended to fairly quickly and the staff was super friendly. I had a very hard time choosing what to eat because of their large menu, it was my first time. So we stared with the appetizers, the fried Mac and Cheese is a must! The crispy crab wontons were okay wouldn't order them again. The waitress recommended the Chicken Bellagio and it was so much food I only ate half even though  wanted to eat the entire plate because it was delicious! My friend had the Chicken Di Pana and he ate his whole plate. I saved room for dessert and ordered the Adam's Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple obsessed and not to mention I am not a cheesecake fan, go figure. Would definitely be back probably to eat the same thing."
Ed T.,"Fayetteville, NC",0,15,3,5.0,1/16/2016,"We had the steak today, and wow was it tender and flavorful. Though it was very busy, Danielle was our server and did a good job making sure that we were satisfied with our meal. We came up here from the Fayetteville/Ft.Bragg area. We wish we had one in our area as we know for a fact that it would get a ton of business."
A B.,"Jacksonville, NC",4,10,,5.0,5/27/2015,"Have always had a wonderful experience here. Very quality and tasty food, pleasant atmosphere. I highly recommend the buffalo blasts appetizer!  The last time we went, we were told honestly by the manager that my father's food was dropped by accident and they were re-making his food. He gave us the meal for free for the inconvenience, which was very kind and much appreciated!"
April A.,"Reidsville, NC",0,16,3,5.0,2/8/2016,OH YUMMM!!!! This was one of the best family dinners out in a long time. Service was excellant! Food was beyond fabulous and huge portions!! We all got a slice of cheesecake except one and he ordered a milkshake. I didn't know you could get those but he said it was the best one he's had. We left happy and carrying out leftovers for the next day to remember our yummy dinner! It was worth the money and would definitely go back again!
Jessica F.,"Hope Mills, NC",0,5,,1.0,8/2/2015,"This was our first and last visit here. Our waitress has no suggestions for meals but persisted we ""go ahead and order"". Half of the menu is advertisements, and we didn't even have our drinks yet. When we received our dip the bread was too hard to break. We requested to return it and remove it from the ticket and she said it was supposed to be like a crouton. When I asked what the sauce was like on the shrimp bistro she said ""I don't know, it's white"" and made no attempt to find out. As soon as our food came she was trying to box it up. I know this place is busy, but come on!!!!"
Brian E.,"Raleigh, NC",148,66,16,5.0,10/28/2015,What can I say. It's always great food and I would go more often if the wait wasn't so ridiculous. Amazing food but I'm not waiting 3 hours to eat anything.
Sarah C.,"Bowie, MD",12,12,2,3.0,6/12/2016,"We haven't been to CF in well over a year. I have always been a fan of the food. The bread that came out was really dry - like it had sat in a warmer too long or was stale, which immediately worried me. But the main courses never disappoint. The Chicken and Biscuits is my go-to, but this time I had The Chicken Bellagio. Really good. We also had the Fish Tacos and Smokehouse burger - burger was really good, skip the tacos. The service, however...  not great. We sat a long time with empty drink glasses more than once, and at the end of the meal while we had our cheesecake we all had nothing to drink with them. Our server came and offered to refill while we were finishing and signing the check. Not good. The table next to us was sat after us and left before us, and we saw their waiter more often than ours. While the specialty cheesecakes were really good (Oreo and Adam's PB), the plain cheesecake was just okay. I was pretty surprised. Texture and presentation were fine, but the flavor was just bland. This place is always packed, so I think next time I'll order to-go while I do some shopping, because the service seems to be declining."
Eddie F.,"Fayetteville, NC",9,40,3,4.0,6/27/2015,"The service took a little longer than expected.  We waited approximately 45 minutes to be seated.  The table we were assigned was very tight.  Not really a section you would want to assign a large person such as myself.  Once the food was delivered, the wait was worth it.  The vanilla bean cheesecake and the herb crusted chicken was great.  Lost a few points because my sis Shawanna had paper in her chicken more than likely from the packaging paper the chicken was wrapped in and the cook failed to remove all of it.  All in all a very decent dining experience."
Donnell P.,"Raleigh, NC",367,78,204,5.0,5/11/2014,"I recently went here for Mother's Day. There was a long wait, we expected this especially since it was Mother's Day. I order the Spicy Cashew Chicken, while everyone else ordered the Lettuce Wraps and Fried Shrimp Platter. All of our dishes were great and the so called Spicy Cashew Chicken was good, it really wasn't that spicy. I was very happy with that, I like a little kick but anything overwhelmingly spicy can be a little much for me. We always like to come here to eat from time to time, hopefully next time we will have room for dessert."
Billy J.,"Detroit, MI",276,205,96,4.0,4/5/2013,"This place is great. Great service, great food and it is so so good Save room for that cheesecake it's worth it"
Deva R.,"Raleigh, NC",12,25,21,4.0,9/17/2014,"I love going here and ordering one of the cheaper meals, i.e. that California omelette for $11 or so, so that I can get two pieces of cheesecake -- one to eat some while there, and the other one and a half to take home and nibble on for the next day or two. The food is always piping hot and very tasty. I've had the egg scramble, the omelette mentioned, the grilled salmon with mashed potatoes and asparagus is my go-to. They also have some really good grilled spinach that you can sub for if you're not down with asparagus. I appreciate that tangy lemon butter sauce they pour over the plate with the grilled salmon meal. (And no, they don't cook the salmon to death here -- thank goodness! Though still, I always do try to remember to ask for it medium rare to medium as a safeguard.) The numerous flavors of cheesecake are exactly what I'm into, and I've tried almost every kind, including several of the seasonals. My go-to, however, is the TUXEDO cheesecake, with that vanilla mascarpone layer underneath the topmost chocolate layer, and a chocolate cake layer on the bottom. Whew!!! Heaven. Also good are the chocolate chip cookie dough, the carrot cake, and the white chocolate macadamia nut!"
Mary-Kaitlyn K.,"Raleigh, NC",3,12,1,5.0,11/25/2015,"I absolutely love this place. I always get the best possible service. The food is wonderful and the servers give great information about the menu items when you're overwhelmed by the glorious, huge menu. The cheesecake is amazing of course but I really just go for the Mojitos. Yes, it's a little pricey but you get what you pay for. Great food and great service. Worth every penny to me."
Silvia G.,"Raleigh, NC",0,2,4,5.0,1/9/2016,"Love coming here for lunch whenever I go to the mall. Food is fantastic. I love the Belgian waffle with strawberries and pecans. Best part is the desert. A chocolate cheesecake is so nice after a meal. Service is great. They always come by and ask how I'm doing or if I needed anything. Wait time could be short or non at all if you come in early but it might take around half an hour if they're super busy, but that's expected."
