Cat L.,"Apex, NC",55,102,373,4.0,8/31/2014,"My husband and I ate here for the first time last night. Our previous attempts ended unsuccessfully due to the ridiculous wait times but thankfully we were lucky to walk in on a Saturday night with only 10/15min wait. We ordered the deep fries macncheese which was sinfully delicious. We also ordered the soup of the day, baked potato soup, which was good but missing something to really take it over the top, maybe just a little more salt or a kick of something-hard to say. We ordered ribeye steak with mashed potatoes & onion rings. As well as a chicken & penne pasta dish. Honestly I didn't think the food was worth the price but the cheesecake is enough to make me come back again & again. For dessert we has the vanilla bean cheesecake which sounds very plain compared to their other items but it hit the spot.  The service was great (waitress was named Lindsey) & the atmosphere was warm & welcoming. We probably won't come back for dinner in a hurry, but will definitely make a dessert run here & try another one of their decadent cheesecakes."
Karmilla C.,"Cary, NC",49,58,108,3.0,8/11/2014,"Kinda is disappoint... We ordered chicken wing which was over fired and dry:( and I ordered shrimp with angels hair-$17.50 which is absolutely not worth, the shrimp size was quite small, and doesn't taste too fresh.. The pasta was just OK... You can definitely make better pasta by yourself.. At least, the light strawberry cheese cake was good! Pretty light and smooth, that's why I am giving 3 starts...  However, the service was not as good as I would respect, maybe it such a busy restaurant... The waitress brought us the bill way early before we can get our dessert... We waited almost 20mins after paid the bill... And she forgot our forks till we requested..  If it's not because my customer over sea wants to try and eat here, I would make another choice. But over all, was acceptable I guess. Just that $80 for three people don't think it's worth."
Melisa S.,"Raleigh, NC",55,153,74,5.0,10/19/2012,Never disappointed with a meal here and have yet to have a bad slice of cheesecake. Had their fried macaroni balls and thought I had died and gone to macaroni and cheese heaven! My fave besides the 1000 calorie pasta is their chicken and avocado club! It always has just the right amount of avocado and mayo. Yummy!  Sometimes the appetizers can seem like a little for a lot of $ but at least they are tasty and the servers always seem willing to go the extra mile!
John N.,"Raleigh, NC",421,96,52,5.0,3/14/2014,"If you've been to one you've been to them all If you've Been once, you will certainly go back All of their dishes are amazing and naturally the cheesecake is to die for"
Ruicheng W.,"Fuquay Varina, NC",0,9,22,4.0,8/28/2015,"So big menu, you can get everything like Chinese food,Japanese ,Mexico, Italian .I just a little concern about can them make a good dish.When the food come out,every one just enjoy it,all test good."
Amanda A.,"Knightdale, NC",113,275,182,3.0,1/28/2014,"Been there a few times and here is some highlights of my experience: Good: Like the bread and butter when you sit down.   Service is always good. Pastas always have a nice flavor and perfect amount of sauce. I like how if you just want to order dessert to go there is an area for that so you can get in and out. Portion sizes are large.  That being said the prices reflect it and normally I have to take food home and I would rather get and pay for smaller portions and eat it at one sitting. Bad: Menu is too large.  So many pages and options.  Three pages of appetizers alone.  Also all of the advertisements in the menu seems cheap.  The food is not cheap so do you have to subject your guests to pages of advertisements that surely you sold that space for? The veggie burger is downright gross.  I will admit it is hard to find a place with a good one but this was on the list of the worse ones I have ever had. I can't ding them on always being crowded - good for them!  But the tables, esp. in the bar area are so close that you have no privacy.  It is like you are almost sitting next to  a stranger. Loud.  Very loud.  Nothing intimate about the setting as you almost have to yell at each other to talk.  Nothing warm and inviting about the atmosphere.  Not relaxing. Fries are salty. Desserts are WAY overpriced.  I have had some very dry ones, too.  Lastly the Limonchello cake.  The cheesecakes are normally good but charging about $8 for a slice of anything is too much! I only go here when I am with someone who wants to.  The good is ok, a little on the pricy side and the atmosphere does not lend to making the dining experience enjoyable."
Carter C.,"Raleigh, NC",29,57,204,4.0,12/18/2011,"The only reason this place doesn't get five stars is because it's crowded and loud because EVERYONE wants to go here, and for good reason.  The food is bangin! Aside from the wait, the worst part about this place is trying to make a decision about what to order!  The menu is freaking huge and full of choices that just SOUND great. We've ordered a big range of items, from the ""healthier"" side of things, down to the decadent.  The food has never disappointed us. For a drink I often get the strawberry lemonade.  I warning here, don't order this if you don't have a sweet tooth.  This drink is non-alchoholic, and delicious, but it's like sipping liquid sugar.  If the south was famous for lemonade instead of sweet tea, I'm pretty sure this is would be the signature drink. If I had to suggest something, the Fried Macaroni and Cheese would be a great start.  Great flavor in the cheese and the marinara sauce.  Make sure you have a friend to share with though, or this might as well be your meal.  The mac and cheese balls are sizable.  For dinner, try the gumbo, or the spicy jerk shrimp, or the garlic and basil angel hair pasta with shrimp. All so good.  In regards to their fish and chips, it was perfect.  If it's fried, The Cheesecake Factory is probably going to do it perfectly. For dessert, it's the Cheesecake Factory, dur.   There's tons of choices and they're all awesome. The downsides to this place are the crowd and the seating.  The atmosphere here is really nice, when it's not packed to the gills with people.  The place is big, and Cheesecake Factory leaves no inch unseated.  The booths are fine, but the tables can be small and cramped.  When it's full, the place is loud.  Be warned. Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights, the waits could be up to an hour.  The good news is, it's open till 12:30 on Saturdays.  Being able to get good food after 10pm is a rare thing in Raleigh, and the wait drops quickly after 10:30."
Steve M.,"Youngsville, NC",0,13,,2.0,6/5/2016,"Not to be Scrooge here but be prepared. I knew parking was a problem. I knew the wait on a Sat night would be an hour. I knew it would be a little pricey. My issues were three. Lighting was so poor one of my kids had to read the fine print. Some other tables were better. Portions were small. Three of our four entrees were lunch sized portions. Pasta is cheap, they could do much better. The biggest issue I had was a twenty minute wait for one piece of cheesecake to go. So I'm thinking wow, presentation must be awesome. Nope just a piece of cheesecake on a plate. Its the equivalent of going to DQ and having to wait for ice cream. After the drive, the parking, the wait, this place could do better. Food flavor, and wait service was good and menu HUGE overly so."
Thomas S.,"Goldsboro, NC",0,9,,5.0,10/18/2015,The macaroni cheese balls are to die for! The wait sometimes is long but it's because the food is delicious. It's my favorite place to eat by far. Don't get me started on their cheesecake
Lori R.,"Raleigh, NC",799,1037,4140,4.0,10/15/2011,"Let me make sure I have this right...The Cheesecake Factory has added to their already extensive menu and the added items are called SkinnyLicious!?     True story.  And it's not some teeny tiny skimpy menu of unappealing selections.  No.  This is a menu of great sounding CHOICES.      Oh, and such choices include drinks as well.  Which is why I had to start with a Mojito for 150 calories.  Same old mojito I've had elsewhere only nice to know some calories were shaved off by using a sugar substitute.      Seriously, the new skinnylicious choices ALL looked so good that it was really hard for me to make my choice.  Add these to the main full book, and there's a lot to look at.  Thankfully our cute, young, friendly waitress brought their delicious non-skinny bread and butter to tide us over.  (sigh, am weak).   So, husband orders off the main menu...fish and chips. Torn between many items including the Asian Chicken salad, finally, I order the SkinnyLicious Vegetable Salad: ""Asparagus, Green Beans, Tomato, Cucumber, Roasted Beets, Apple, Edamame, Radicchio, Romaine and White Cheddar All Chopped with SkinnyLicious™ Pomegranate Vinaigrette.""   Out came a giant bowl of chopped veggie greatness!  I do believe that someone either put a little Asian dressing on it by mistake, or used the same spoon...either way, one side of the salad had an Asian dressing flavor, which I'm not complaining about....it actually made me feel kinda like I got BOTH salads I was interested in.  The salad was fresh, crunchy, full of flavor and absolutely HUGE.     Meanwhile, husband is chomping down on a giant serving of fish and chips and slaw.  Waitress was very busy and his tea wasn't always kept full, but I think he was charmed enough by her cute youthful friendliness that he didn't seem concerned.     By the way, all through our meal, we got to watch the thin, young gals next to us devour giant pasta and breaded chicken meals, followed by huge slices of decadent cheesecake. May their young tiny hearts jog in peace afterwards.  Anyway, I digress.   We both ended up needing take-out containers. My guess is most people leave with about half their meal. We both did.   Prices here aren't cheap, especially for drinks.  My mojito was $9.25 (they conveniently don't put alcohol prices on the menu, not a practice I'm fond of, but I could've asked too)...husband's plain iced black tea was $2.95.  Fish and Chips:  a hefty $16.50, and my salad was $9.95.    Total:  $41.65 before tip.  But that's okay, because it's WORTH IT!     Standing ovation Cheesecake Factory for your new SkinnyLicious Menu!  Now, do you mind moving to a less crowded, less-aggravating mall to get in and out of?  :)"
David L.,"Wendell, NC",15,2,,3.0,8/17/2015,"My girlfriend and I love the Cheesecake Factory. We normally try to sit outside if the weather is nice. Tonight we sat with Jennifer C.. Horrible experience. My girlfriend and I both work in the service industry and this waitress couldn't have cared less about us. My girlfriend ordered a Greek salad with no kalamata olives, came with them. She ordered the four cheese pasta and asked for extra ricotta cheese and Jennifer brought her Parmesan. I had the meatloaf which was great but took forever to get a refill on my drink it seemed. Overall great restaurant, horrible server."
Bhaviksinh J.,"Durham, NC",83,36,2,1.0,1/26/2015,"If you have ADD stay away, the menu is a freakishly long novel. There's no doubt that you will find amazing food on the menu but I personally felt overwhelmed by their offerings and didn't really like the commercialized factory vibe."
Emily M.,"Havelock, NC",64,13,6,2.0,8/10/2015,Our server was very nice and the location is great...but that doesn't beat my pancake not being cooked all the way through. We weren't very happy to have paid $12 for raw pancake batter...
Hettion S.,"Raleigh, NC",17,13,8,4.0,9/14/2014,"This experience was much better than before. At first my patience was being tested because other patrons were being seated before my group. However, after being seated, our waitress was ON POINT. Everything was great expect the price tag. Would recommend only as a splurge or celebration."
Michael S.,"Garner, NC",16,17,1,1.0,2/10/2015,"As i sit here waiting for our meal my wife is telling me ""I told you so"" in that we should not have conw back. The hostess was rude, our waiter could not be more disrespectful to our group and the noise level is forcibg us to bend over the table just to hear each other. Mostly though it's the amazingly rude staff that kept us away before and niw solidifies we won't be back."
R.C. S.,"Lower Burrell, PA",28,6,,2.0,7/20/2014,"This was my first Cheesecake Factory visit. I was on a business trip. 20 minute wait....Nice decor, everything is goddy...Service was good, food was fast out of the kitchen. Server had a professional look, demeanor and attire. I ordered a Cheese Steak, fries and iced tea. It was served on a very nice semi hard roll.Other than that...it was still a cheese steak and fries. Not a huge portion or anything special. $24.00 later I was out the door.......Seriously.....for a sandwich and fries. I'm not a fan of over priced food at corporate restaurants."
Taylor M.,"Cary, NC",0,137,1,2.0,10/11/2013,"How can one provide a five-star rating for the cheesecake, and a one-star rating for the creepy dining atmosphere designed by someone who failed his auditions in Las Vegas and Disneyland? The menu is a confusing mess.  CF tries too hard and ends up really only being good at cheesecake. Appropriately, it's attached to a mall.  Parking is a mess, and for some odd reason, the place is always quite busy.  I guess there are a lot of people who enjoy CF.  Different strokes and all...."
Robb E.,"Raleigh, NC",23,26,1,5.0,5/22/2015,Had lunch there yesterday with me wife and it was delicious. The service was excellent. I had the Shepherds Pie and my wife had the Fish N Chips. Both lunches were terrific. I have never had a bad meal there.
Nancy B.,"Los Angeles, CA",122,110,71,4.0,5/2/2015,"The thing I love about this company is that it's pretty consistent whatever city you find it in. My party of five started with two and eventually amassed the last stragglers. Our server was ever so patient with our indecisiveness and as our food started to come, we were all happily satiated with our meals. My salmon, mashed potatoes and asparagus were spot on. Maybe it's that pumpernickel that seems to placate the diners every time, or the delightfully frivolous cocktails, or the generous portions. If that doesn't make you happy, there's that sinful case of cheesecake to treat yourself from as you walk in to the restaurant."
Natasha W.,"Jacksonville, NC",90,21,,1.0,7/9/2015,"I've never been so insulted in my entire life. I LOVE Cheesecake Factory, but after the experience that I had today, I will never, EVER return. I had a medium sized group- 5 adults, 2 children and 1 10 year old. Why did we have to wait almost an hour to be seated, when it was lunchtime and the restaurant was half empty? Also, a group of around the same number of people, mostly adults, came in well after us and were seated right away. We were so disgusted with the horrible customer service, blatant disrespect, and racism, and left. I'm so disappointed that I even have to gift this establishment with 1 star."
