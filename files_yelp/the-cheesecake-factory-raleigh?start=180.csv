Wayne C.,"Durham, NC",15,7,,4.0,7/3/2015,Our first time going was tonight and the menu is a bit overwhelming to say the least it's like 22 pages long I recommend to look it over online but the portion sizes are extra big   Our meal choices were small green salad that's enough to fill basketball the appetizer meatballs were 3 large ones full of flavor   Margarita pizza is bomb  the fried shrimp were huge   Baked Parmesan  chicken was good sauce was a very greasy and ran over everything else on plate  lastly is the lighting is very dim which make it hard to read the menu   Desert was a bit disappointing the cheese cake is like whipped mush but has great flavor
Michelle A.,"Raleigh, NC",19,167,4,4.0,1/10/2014,"Wish they had one closer to home.  Service here is good sometimes great, depends on when you go and how busy they are.  Never been when they aren't packed solid.  Seating can get cramped especially if you do not get a booth.  The tables are too close together and sometimes feels like you are having dinner with total strangers. Food is always, always, on point.  Never been and not had great food.  Portions are very large so be prepared not to finish it all and take it home.  Prices are a little on the high side, but to be expected.  And of course, the cheesecake!  Red velvet cheesecake is my all time favorite."
Laura G.,"Raleigh, NC",196,497,528,4.0,11/21/2013,"I loved the lunch sized portions. They allow you to have a great selection of choices and the prices are pared down as well. Also they have a skinny menu for those who want to make lighter choices. I had the lunch sized chicken salad, it was delicious. And our server was excellent. My friend had the chicken salad with sweet potato fries (from the skinny menu) and she was equally happy.  Bravo to the Cheesecake Factory for both of these. My only complaint from this visit was that I did not like the table they brought us to first and we had to get back in the queue to be assigned another table. (The table they brought us to was in the bar, was very close to other tables, and you had to put your feet on the round table bottom while sitting there). Luckily there was only one other couple waiting for a table so we were seated at a second table immediately, but don't put me back in the queue because you are trying to seat me at an unacceptable table."
Rachel P.,"Raleigh, NC",0,3,,2.0,1/13/2016,"I came out for dinner last night and was sorely disappointed. The service was below par (I couldn't even get a straw for my water after asking several times) I was served raw salmon. RAW!  As if that isn't bad enough, a manager never came by to check on me, which I guess isn't that hard to believe since we only saw our server approximately 4 times during dinner. The two stars are for the delicious cheesecake I took home and the strawberry martini I had with dinner."
Charlotte H.,"Wilmington, NC",92,197,32,4.0,10/3/2013,"I ate until I felt like I was going to vomit and I have no regrets! We wanted to go somewhere special for my husband's birthday and I was immediately sold after viewing their online menu. Polenta fries? Portabella mushroom, avocado, and zucchini fries? Avocado eggrolls? I didn't even need to look beyond small plates and appetizers.  We ended up ordering and sharing: Portabella mushroom, avocado, and zucchini fries, spinach and artichoke dip, garlic noodles, four cheese pasta, a Dulce de Leche shake, a raspberry cheesecake, and a slice of Tiramisu cheesecake. Obviously, a lot of our food was boxed to-go, but nearly everything was decadent and delicious. The only dish I wasn't carried away with was our spinach and artichoke dip, I frequently order it as an appetizer, but it didn't seem to stand out compared with the rest of our meal."
Zachary H.,"Raleigh, NC",69,52,13,4.0,4/13/2015,"Ate here for the first time in many moons this past weekend.  Yes, I was at the mall on a Saturday.  Had fish tacos and a couple Sam Adams on draft.  My girl got a glam burger, she was happy with taste but was not quite cooked at correct temp.  Not major though.  All in all good for a chain."
Mage L.,"Los Angeles, CA",99,280,590,4.0,5/18/2011,"I've been to the Cheesecake Factory many times around the country.  I've tried many of the entrees, and most of the time, I came away thinking the prices were too high, the portions were too big, and the food was just mediocre.  Based on a coworker's recommendation, I tried the Miso Salmon, and I've stuck with that ever since.  It's simply a reliable, good, reasonably priced entree that's consistent at every Cheesecake Factory I've been to. On this particular visit, I was in a group of 7 coworkers.  I already knew Cheesecake Factory doesn't take reservations, so I made sure we all got there before noon on a Wednesday.  Lucky for us, the lunch crowd hadn't hit yet, so we were able to get a table without waiting. The service was a bit slow for lunch, but I expect with 7 different entrees it's hard to get them all prepared quickly.  The bread was delicious as usual, and was a good snack while waiting for food.  2 of my coworkers also ordered the miso salmon on my recommendation, and liked it as much as I did.  Another coworker ordered the Thai lettuce wraps, which I've had before and they are delicious.  My only problem with the lettuce wraps is they're messy to eat, especially when you're eating in front of other people you work with.  If the lettuce wraps were already prepared by the staff in nice little tightly wrapped leaves, I would probably get them more often.  But my lettuce would always break or drip sauces and fillings all over. For cheesecake I ordered the Kahlua/chocolate one.  It was pretty good, but I can make a better cheesecake at home for less than $7.  I've had some of the other kinds in the past, and none are bad.  None really ""wow"" me either though. We got in and out of Cheesecake Factory with a group of 7 in about an hour and a half, which isn't bad.  The server was always attentive throughout the meal, and got us our individual checks without any mix-ups.  They put the extra 18% on our checks, which is fine by me.  The server would have gotten 2% more from me since I normally tip 20%, but alas, when they pre-add the tip they don't give you another tip line to write on.  His loss. I'll probably go again with coworkers in the future, since it's a place that people can easily agree on.  I think if choosing between restaurants in Crabtree though, I would probably pick PF Chang's or Red Monkey Tavern over Cheesecake Factory.  There's just so many new and exciting entrees to try at other restaurants, whereas at Cheesecake Factory I feel like I'm stuck on the Miso Salmon simply because I've been so disappointed in the past when I've tried the other entrees there."
Gregory H.,"Durham, NC",88,1021,87,3.0,3/18/2011,"This is a strong 3, but I cannot go four stars for this Cheesecake Factory. The service here seems to be a little weak, meaning slow.  Having a group of 10 (all family, 8 adults and 2 children) during a busy lunch time probably doesn't help the staff much.  The worst thing I can say about this visit is one person in our group didn't get their food until the rest of us were nearly finished eating.  On the plus side, the food was better than average for having a burger (blue cheese BLT burger -yum). What I normally love about TCF is getting an entire cheesecake to take home and celebrate the birthday we were at the restaurant for to begin with.  For some reason it's much easier to enjoy the dessert at home, and the lemon cream raspberry was a perfect selection. The Good: great burger Awesome cheesecake The Bad: timing of food delivery to a large party, leaving that one person out and making them feel left out and forgotten. The Ugly: Nothing to report here"
K S.,"Raleigh, NC",0,8,,1.0,8/18/2015,"I have family that work at Crabtree so we have gone to Cheesecake Factory a number of times. This occasion was my sister's mother-in-law's birthday celebration. A very sweet 76 year old woman who was accompanied by 'Sister' another very sweet elderly lady. We arrived at 2:25pm on a Sunday afternoon, expecting a wait of course. We were told a 25 minute wait for a table. All right thats acceptable. After 50 minutes of waiting in an overheated hallway I went up to ask how much longer it will be. Was told rather rudely that it will be an additional 15 minutes since we had the audacity to have 7 people in our party. Now, I've worked in restaurants before, happen to have owned one in the past. And letting my eyes wander around the restaurant I saw at least two tables that could accommodate a slightly larger than regular party of 7..both tables were empty and reset. No one was being shown to them and they remained empty the 5 minutes or so it took for me to get the attention of the hostess. Finally after 15 more minutes we were called to the hostess stand where were subjected to standing around (with 2 older women over 75) with I would guess part of another large party for at least 5 more minutes while we waited for someone (not a hostess) to show us to a 'table' which ended up being a cramped booth really meant for 4 people (perhaps 6 in a crunch) with a chair thrown at the end of it blocking a narrow passageway.  There were two other same sized booths completely empty by the way..right next to the one we had just been sat at. My husband had the misfortune of getting the chair at the end of the booth and was constantly being bumped into by passing wait staff. Let me round it up and say that the wait for a table exceeded an hour. Our order was taken promptly enough, my unsweet tea was refilled with sweet tea (absolutely hate that)  and we proceeded to wait an additional 50 minutes for 5 salads , a hamburger,and a dried out chicken dish. Our waiter was replaced mid way through our service because obviously we went from being lunch customers to dinner, since it now was after 4:00pm. My husband had to take his salad to go because the wait was so long and he had to return to work. We all ordered cheesecake and they sang a happy birthday..except my cheesecake did not come out with the others. By the time it did everyone else in the party was finished and ready for the checks and to get the heck out of there. I asked for it to go. From start to finish, the whole unpleasant experience lasted almost 3 uncomfortable hours.  Unfortunately, I will not be coming back. Its been a tradition to take the older members of our family there to celebrate their birthdays. But I was in a state of discomfort after waiting over an hour for a table, being crammed in an uncomfortable booth for almost an additional 2 hours..I can only just imagine how very uncomfortable those two ladies were at the end of the meal. They were too polite to complain. I fortunately do not suffer the same malady. Hey Cheesecake...you need to hire a competent and time conscious hostess, you need to be better organized, and have a quicker turn around. You need to train your staff better on a whole. I had your waitress' shirt sleeve in my meal at least a half dozen times. Horrendous. This restaurant cannot handle parties over 4. They aren't equipped for it."
Erika B.,"Havelock, NC",31,1,,2.0,9/13/2015,"The food is always wonderful at the Cheesecake factory, and the only reason I go. I work at a restaurant as a waitress and I will say the costumer service I always receive at this restaurant is near to none. The service is always very bland and nothing great for what you'd expect at such an expensive, high quality restaurant.  I get better costumer service at a McDonald's honestly and that's pathetic. Last night I went to the Cheesecake factory for my birthday. As we sat on the patio it started to look like it was going to rain and began to sprinkle a little. A waiter we getting his table an umbrella. He asked us if we would like one, and we said yes.... he looked at us and said.. with an attitude  ""they are over their, you can go get one"".... for one I do not go to a restaurant and spend well over $100 to get my own umbrella. Not to mention he was very rude about it. We eventually got our table moved inside bc of the rain. We spoke to a manager about the issue and the Manger didn't seem to be too nterested nor care attitude all. Not sure if this was an hourly manager or what but by his very unprofessional attitude I would assume so. I think all of the employees seem to be very unprofessional. When the group of guys came to sing happy birthday to me at my table,  they made me feel miserable.  You could see the ""I hate my life"" all over there faces and they were walking off before they barely got the last word out. I just as much as any waitress understand that some days we just don't want to, but the phrase ""fake it till you make it"" applies in this job.  For them to go to work and make the money they do waiting tables, you'd think they'd work a little harder and be alot happier.  I deal with crazy, ridiculous people at my job and I always have a smile on my face and work hard for my money. They barely put a quarter of the effort I put in on a daily to all of my tables. The Cheesecake factory is only surviving because of the wonderful chefs they have, because it was by far one of the worst experiences I have ever had in a restaurant based on costumer service."
Julia H.,"Raleigh, NC",81,400,192,3.0,5/10/2011,"Had some business at Crabtree Mall, so we decided to try out the legendary Cheesecake Factory. I've had their cheesecake before and liked it, but I will have to say that when it comes to the food, sticking with the eponymous dish was a good idea!  I ordered the eggplant sandwich, which included a LOT of cheese, roasted red peppers and aioli. Unfortunately, it was also served on a slightly sweet, fairly stale sesame seed burger bun which didn't do it any favours at all. I ended up eating the filling and leaving the bun behind. It wasn't bad, but it was rather oily and pretty salty, so much so that I felt a little queasy afterward. The sandwich came with Syscotastic fries, which were unremarkable. The spouse had the Evelyn's Pasta of penne with pine nuts, roasted vegetables and dried tomatoes; he pronounced it good, but also a lot more oily than expected. Service was average, but the music was absolutely dire and quite loud as well. Patio seating was nice, though, as the building kept things well shaded. All in all, if we do go back I'm sticking with the cheesecake in the future."
Phil S.,"Pelham, NH",48,129,71,4.0,6/28/2015,"This was my first time at this location.  Very busy - but our group of 14 was seated very quickly without reservations.  The staff is professional and do work hard.  For our group a normal ticket price per person was $30.00 without alcohol.  The menu selection was very large - so there really is something for everyone.  The food quality was excellent.  Service was very efficient, friendly, and professional.  The interior decor was superior for a chain restaurant - but this is not Applebee's. I would recommend this location."
Jenita M.,"Lumberton, NC",89,412,1402,4.0,11/7/2013,Stopped in for cheesecakes!  I ordered Wild Blueberry and my boyfriend got Fresh Strawberry Cheesecake.  My boyfriend suggested the bakery section to have a marquee for orders because it was so loud inside that everyone was frustrated with the wait and trying to hear the announcement of orders on a Saturday night.
Aluanna F.,"Jacksonville, NC",1,60,5,3.0,3/22/2015,"The food is a 4 star, service 3-4star, the waiting time is a 2 star so overall 3! Once seated, lengthy process to order, bring food and close the bill! Exhausting."
Tamara O.,"Raleigh, NC",136,13,12,5.0,5/22/2013,"I have been to many Cheesecake Factory restaurants many times. And most times, those visits involve a minimum 30 minute wait. I must have had some birthday pixie dust sprinkled on me, because the two most recent visits (on a Saturday afternoon and a Tuesday afternoon), involved less than a 20 minute wait. Score 1! During both visits, the food was scrumptious, and the lunch portions are always huge - so if you are visiting before 5, and see something on the lunch menu that you like - get it. The lunch portions are huge, and cost less than the full-sized (and much bigger portions). I wasn't even able to finish my meal - especially after filling up on the bread that they offer. Score 2! On Saturday, I had the meatloaf and mashed potatoes - so much that I couldn't finish. I had to save room for the strawberry shortcake that my 6-year needed help with. I took my red velvet cheesecake to go. Mmm, mmm good!! On Tuesday, I had the succulent herb-crusted salmon, mashed potatoes and asparagus. Once again, the lunch portion was so much, that I had the rest for dinner.  Our server, Shannon, saw a birthday gift bag on our table, and at the end of our meal, brought me over an adorable glass cup of ice cream, whipped cream and fudge with sprinkles on top, complete with a glowing candle. Score 3! I thought that was super sweet, and a nice way to end an already awesome experience!"
A A.,"Hollywood, FL",0,35,2,1.0,11/2/2014,"Yes. I have been here before in many cities. I will prob never go back.  There is not any particular reason other than it's just ok, very expensive, tip oriented wait staff & so unbelievably busy at all hours- people act like this is a nice restaurant. That is hilarious.  It's generic & it's mall food  - head down to tomato pie  if you find yourself hungry at the mall!"
Michael H.,"Baton Rouge, LA",59,577,89,1.0,10/27/2010,"So I get dragged to the Cheesecake Factory periodically for work functions, and I'm always left wondering what lucky soul gets paid to run the microwave in the kitchen. It's that bad. There's a plethora of great restaurants in Raleigh, and wasting time at this chain is time you'll never get back in your life. The menu is spiral bound, and it's chock full of advertising. I don't know about you, but when I flip through a menu I want to see lines of text with food descriptions and prices, and ONLY food descriptions and prices. It's rare for the food to arrive at a correct and consistent temperature; evidence of heat lamps and microwaves at work. This is especially bothersome when we're talking about simple staples like hamburgers and steaks. The ""banner"" cheesecakes - the namesake of this restaurant and what should be its crown jewel - tastes like something out of a just-add-water box. I agree with the other reviewers who have suggested that the menu be cut in half (after they lose the advertising), and that they focus on doing the basics a lot better than they do. If you're into thick, yummy desserts and want to spend money at a place with real cooking and baking happening in a real kitchen, please head down the road a few miles to the Hayes Barton Cafe. For about the same money you'll get dinner and dessert that is light years ahead of this piffle."
Joseph S.,"Clayton, NC",0,1,,1.0,1/29/2016,"Ordered filet medium, received with no pink left.  Took server 10 min to come back.  Got calamari instead, it was undercooked.  Will not return."
X X.,"Washington, DC",0,351,,1.0,5/11/2016,"They have nice desserts. The male customers get good service. Not like the females. The dessert case is good. Waitstaff walk away from customers. Either to eat a meal. Or wait on other customers. Waitstaff will only give good service. To a lot of people at the table. The hostess will walk in front female customers. Block the walkway. And try to step on the foot. And stand behind them and yell in the ear. The female hostess only volunteer to wait on male customers in line. They not wait on people in order. Waiting in a line to get wait on. They will not volunteer to wait on female customers. And they throw the menu on the table. And run away. The menu has good value for price paid. And a lot to choose from. Menu is big. WE had continual problems with waiter. He got angry not a tip. And he not volunteer to wait on us. WE had to ask him come to the table. He not want to write down the order. Said not his job. We said so. WE order hamburger. It came burned and mayonnaise and cheese on it. We only wanted lettuce and tomato More french fries on the plate than the hamburger size. Waiter not volunteer to give us bread before the meal. WE not order ice and diet soft drink. The drinks are expensive. And big glass. We got 3/4 ice and diet soft drink. WE had to have it changes. Rush to get rid of us, interrupt and yell at us, ate food while wait on us. Waiter not come back to help us with our meal. He left to eat a meal. He gave us food and drink. And tried to run away quickly. He got angry not a tip. And he gave us all complimentary drinks. We complained too many problems."
Christopher M.,"New York, NY",1528,1580,361,3.0,11/23/2010,"This branch exemplifies the epitome of US Tourist Commercialism that Cheesecake Factory is known for even more than other branches because of the sheer size of the place.   I didn't want to go in at first because I usually hate chains and was really daunted by the Voldemort-like evil radiating from this particular location.  But I was on vacay...the folks told me there was a CF...and I couldn't stop jonesin' for the Reese's PB Choco Cheesecake.   So I did a drive-by run-in.   The place was way too darkly lit to see if it was actually clean.  But the servers seemed friendly, the reps behind the dessert counter were quite nice, and the portions were far larger than I've ever seen at a CF (which makes up for the prices, which are comparable to NYC Times Square). The last time I had CF was about 5 years ago.  When I opened my container I noticed that CF has changed the ratio of cake to cheesecake on the Reese's dessert.  But it worked nicely.   I'll probably be back next time I'm in Raleigh, at least for dessert, because I am weak :-)"
