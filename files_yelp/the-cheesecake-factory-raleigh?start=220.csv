Terry W.,"Pittsboro, NC",86,709,1995,4.0,8/6/2010,I have been to many of the Cheesecake Factory's arounf the counrty. They have a standard of quality with each one. I enjoy the Miso Salmon ! Always have a good time. The wait is long but as long as the bar has a stool we are fine. Great decor and the wait staff is fantastic !
Jenny S.,"Raleigh, NC",48,231,19,4.0,2/14/2012,"I've been a huge fan of the Cheesecake Factory's cheesecake ever since a friend of mine used to bring us slices at work all the time. SO TASTY!  However, I've never reviewed the restaurant itself, and honestly I don't eat there often. Not because the food isn't good (it is) or because the service is bad (it isn't), simply because I really hate waiting in lines and this place is ALWAYS packed!  I went with four friends last Sunday and we had a great time. My girlfriend showed up 40 minutes early to secure us a table (praisetheLord) and we were able to sit right down and order drinks. I opted for the Strawberry Martini, which our server warned us ""packed a punch"", but it wasn't bad at all. Quite delicious and honestly sweet enough that the sugar rim was an unnecessary garnish. I did appreciate the giant strawberry on the rim though!  I had the Crispy Crab Bites as an appetizer (from their ""skinny"" menu) and the Turkey burger as my meal. I had requested sweet potato fries and it came out with normal fries, which our server Christopher quickly remedied. Looking at my check I don't see the upcharge for the sweet potato fries, so that was an unexpected bonus.  A lot of times turkey burgers are too obviously pre-formed patties, or they are overly dry. This one was fantastic, but it was almost too moist! It fell apart all over the place and I had to eat it with my fork as a kind of turkey-burger-scramble, but it was delicious nonetheless.  For an appetizer, entree, and two drinks, my tab was still under $50. Not bad for a night out at Southpoint. The only downside was, after all of our food, we didn't have room for any of their signature cheesecake! Oh well.. there's always next time!"
Jasmine T.,"Raleigh, NC",1,1,,2.0,3/16/2015,The lunch special was terrific. I was high as hell but even down to the bread was good..I'm gonna smoke some loud and go try a piece of chocolate cheesecake
Whitney M.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,99,31,4.0,1/18/2015,"The wait was about one to almost two hours so we decided to get cheesecake and head back home while exploring Raleigh yesterday. It was incredibly packed if reservations can be made do so, you will not regret it. My cheese cake was good different from juniors in Brooklyn. I loved them both. All the different varieties will Give you such a sweet tooth. The slices are a little pricey."
Sam J.,"Raleigh, NC",5,21,,2.0,8/15/2013,The most overrated/overpriced chain for people with dead taste buds who are easily impressed with fancy decor. I guess the cheesecakes are good though. Service is good.
Dave G.,"Oriental, NC",4,15,28,4.0,10/23/2012,"Second time here and was impressed again, even though I've still not had any cheesecake!  This go round my lady and I were trying to go light so we got the Vietnamese slider small plate and their nachos.  The nachos were huge, and very delicious!  The guacamole was extremely fresh and we'd wager made in house.  Overall the food and service was excellent, our waitress Jo was spot on.  Only downside were the drink prices, 8 dollars a beer and 10.50 for a martini seemed very steep to me.  Other than that though, a great place to eat while getting some shopping done!"
Mark L.,"Raleigh, NC",26,72,29,5.0,11/25/2011,"My wife and I have been coming here for the past four years, and I can not recall having a bad meal here. I kinda think of it as our ace in the hole when we cant decide on were to eat and we are at or near the Crabtree Mall.  I usually get the dinner sized portion instead of the lunch portion, and despite the fact that I have a healthy appetite, I always have leftovers for later.    Their menu is very big, and sometimes this can be a drawback, however at this TCKF, they do all of their dishes well.  While I like trying something different each time, the dish I have gotten the most is their Cajun Jambalaya Pasta.  It makes me feel like Im relaxing on my comfy couch with my favorite blanket.  Sometimes you just don't want to be anywhere else.  This dish means that to me."
Lauren R.,"Raleigh, NC",47,164,11,4.0,11/10/2011,"There are so many components of the Cheesecake Factory to critique, I'll sort them with pros and cons: Pros: Buzzers to alert you that your table is ready do work in the mall if you want to shop around while you're waiting, the staff is friendly and service has always been good, the portions are insanely large and can usually be consumed by two people or for two meals (and for the portion size, the prices aren't too bad), although I dislike cheesecake (I know, I know!) they do have some great choices that are not cheesecake, and finally, the Skinny menu for those of us that try to be a little more careful with what we eat.   Cons: The menu is like a magazine, entirely too many pages and advertising mixed in with actual food options, the wait time is almost always an hour if you try to go to dinner at 7 and bar space is limited if you want to stay and have a drink while you wait, there is not a romantic place to dine: it's always busy and very loud, and parking can be very difficult but there is always the parking deck."
Lauren H.,"Raleigh, NC",65,273,32,3.0,5/23/2012,"When I think of The Cheesecake Factory, I think of reliably good food with extremely large portions. This is not a place we go regularly, but whenever I do end up here, I never leave disappointed with my meal, and I don't even like cheesecake. We ate dinner here tonight after Josh received a gift card for Christmas. I ordered something new for me, the spicy chicken tacos. The plate came with four tacos that were stuffed full with spicy chicken, cilantro, tomatoes, cabbage, cheese, avocado and crema. They were served with rice and black beans which were also good. Josh got a chicken dish which resembled chicken piccata served with mashed potatoes and asparagus. His was even better than mine. My usual choice here is the Cajun Chicken Littles, which are your basic chicken tenders served with corn and mashed potatoes. However, I wanted to try something new tonight so I steered away from my normal choice. We did not get dessert and left with half of our food for lunch tomorrow. However, I have tried one of the chocolate layer cakes in the past, which was huge and so delicious. As I mentioned earlier, I do not like cheesecake so I can't say much about the cheesecake except that everyone I have eaten here with seems to love the variety of choices. The service here is generally very good. It can get very crowded (usually an hour or more wait, especially on the weekends). We got very lucky tonight and were amazingly seated right away (at 7 PM on a Wednesday night). Overall, this is a good spot to stop for lunch or dinner if you're at the mall. The menu is large enough to have an option to please anyone in your group and they now have a ""Skinny"" menu as well for (slightly) healthier options."
Josh P.,"Raleigh, NC",8,296,205,4.0,3/29/2014,"I have had some really great meals here and some quite mediocre ones. The lack of consistency makes it hard to recommend this chain. I really like the cheesecakes, the chili relleno burger, the chicken marsala, and a few other dishes. However, there is not enough space between the tables and I often feel cramped. Also, my order is frequently wrong and because of this I think I have had more free slices of cheesecake than ones I have paid for."
Jessica P.,"Asheville, NC",64,65,53,5.0,5/31/2011,"For me, this was as good as it gets.  For heaven's sake, I found my new favorite food.  No, not favorite meal at Cheesecake Factory -- favorite food/meal/scrumptious all-around dish I've ever set on my taste buds.   Take it from me - if you're a sushi and salad lover, you've got to try the Seared Tuna Tataki Salad.  It comes with two sauces, which I got both on the side to be safe.  They are to die for.  I couldn't get enough of them!  Also included on this lettuce-based salad is tomato, a big heap of ginger slices, and a side of wasabi.  I cut up everything into smaller pieces, including the tuna tataki, mixed it up as a typical tossed salad, and spread the sauces over top.  Delicious.   I've had my share of sushi eating, as I've been a long-time employee in 2 different Japanese Steakhouses.  To be honest, I was not expecting the quality to compare, but my expectations were greatly exceeded.  It wasn't as big as some of the cheaper (by only $2.00-3.00) salads on the menu, but very worth it. My boyfriend had the Cobb Salad and was equally impressed.  I had a bite and it was great, but an entirely different ball game.  If you're into a typical ranch/thousand island dressed salad, but a fantastic one, that is the one for you. The unlimited bread supply for the table was a great compliment to the salads.  We finished off our meal by splitting the Wild Blueberry White Chocolate Cheesecake.  Nothing but yummy goodness, but then again, I can't say I've ever had a bad piece of cheesecake from here. And one more plus to compliment them on -- though Crabtree mall closes at 9pm, the Cheesecake Factory stays open 'til 12:30am!  A perfect end to an evening of shopping."
Bria H.,"Wilson, NC",0,1,,5.0,6/4/2014,This was my first time going there went there with my best friends to celebrate a birthday and i must say the food and empoylees was great....my friends and family told me i needed to go finally went. At first the hostess told us we had to wait for atleast 15 minutes only turn out to be half of that and the food and drinks and bread and the cheesecake was great. They really give you your money worth couldnt even eat it all and had to take it home.....will be going back!!!!!!!!
Kevin C.,"Charlotte, NC",1,10,1,2.0,12/30/2013,"Would have been a fairly decent meal had it not been for the hair we found stuck in the cup of our child's drink... I assume or hope they threw away that cup and gave us a new one, but just had our child drink from ours after that. Service was slow, but it was busy that day, not defending them but service could have been better. Calamari was good, Burger buns were very soggy, made eating the burger a challenge! Had better, will return for their cheesecake selection but not for food."
Jeff H.,"Raleigh, NC",2,21,7,4.0,4/12/2014,"The Cheesecake Factory is always slammed but it's worth the wait on occasion. The menu is great...the avocado egg rolls are awesome, and the seared tuna was excellent was well. I've been a handful of times...I've honestly never had a bad meal and the portions are always large. The red velvet cheesecake is my favorite, but I've also never had a bad piece of any flavor. My kids love the place and I enjoy it as well"
Emma A.,"Raleigh, NC",120,159,63,2.0,4/3/2013,"Craving cheesecake at 10 pm on a Friday night in Raleigh is never a good idea. Your options are so limited! Cheesecake Factory was my only choice, so I went. Big mistake! I ordered the turtle brownie cheesecake, and when they boxed it up I asked for extra whip cream, which they gave me. Unfortunately, I should have asked for extra cheescake. When I got home and opened it I realized they gave me the smallest piece of cake possible, and the thing was over $8! What the heck! It was the size of an infant's fist. I can buy four times the size of cake at the same price at Hayes Barton, so next time I'll plan my cravings ahead of time so I can be satisfied."
Melissa E.,"Fuquay-Varina, NC",68,197,5,4.0,4/25/2011,"This is a great choice for lunch or dinner (although can be a pricey lunch).  The menu has everything from sandwiches to Mexican to pasta and more!  I am a big fan of the Fish Tacos.  Try the lettuce wraps or Chicken Croquettes for appetizer and ALWAYS finish your meal with dessert. I mean, it is The Cheesecake Factory after all.  I recommend their new Reese's Peanut Butter Cake Cheesecake.  I usually get this to go, because 1. I am full from the meal and 2. it's extremely decadent and filling!   The only downside is there is almost always a wait.  For dinner, it's often quite long.  The good news is that there's a large bar area, so grab a drink while you wait.  If you've already eaten or don't want to wait, get some cheesecake to go.  There's a separate counter for ordering cheesecake to go!"
Kuanyu C.,"Raleigh, NC",274,596,1038,3.0,3/11/2011,"For a long time I treated this place like its namesake, I go there, get my favorite cheesecake, which is the Ultimate Red Velvet Cake Cheesecake, and get out. Never really knew there's a dining hall (just kidding.) However, recently I have had the ""pleasure"" (??) of dining here, once for lunch, once for dinner. Everyone here pretty much sum up about their services and their hospitality practices, so all I'm going to comment on are the food that I got. For the lunch I got the seared tuna tataki salad. Can't say that I have a salad quite like this, and that's neither a compliment nor complaint. They did their tataki right, the ""wasabi vinaigrette"" was inventive, and I honestly can't understand the avocado? to imitate sushi ingredient perhaps? It was an experience, let's just say that. For the dinner date I had the Mahi Mahi Mediterranean. The fish was not terribly cooked, stayed in shape, but kind of lukewarm. It seasoned well enough to work with the vinaigrette and mashed potatoes. Overall, my dining experience here was not bad, but I was not one of those ""Man! I'll have to come back again and try the other dish I saw on the menu."""
Jessy H.,"Willow Spring, NC",104,207,217,3.0,12/23/2013,"The cheesecake is 5 stars to me but almost everything else is just alright. I went here yesterday after shopping at the mall and there was no wait surprisingly. The place was packed though. They sat my fiancée and I at this horrible table. It was part both and the other side chairs. It was so small, and uncomfortable. We had chicken sliders they were good and I thought it was a large appetizer (we got 4 of them). We also ordered a beer. The menu says what beers they have but no prices. I asked if they had any beer specials and my waiter said no we never have specials (rudely) and asked for my id. I would of never ordered the beers if I knew I would be paying 7.25 per glass! And the waiter asked if we wanted another one and never mentioned the cost. We ordered 4 beers and it end up costing as much as our appetizer and two entrees. For the entrees we got Alfredo which was very plain I did not eat most of it. The other entree was stuffed chicken tortillas. Most of the plate was filled with black beans, the pancakes that came with them were too sweet, too cornmeal tasting, and the tortillas were just okay. The floor was slippery so I mentioned it to a waitress passing by and she said it was from the grease they carry out from the kitchen and they have non slip shows so it doesn't bother them. I almost slipped and than I watched a woman shortly after almost do the same thing. They said they would clean the floor, they never did. I would go back for the cheesecake and that's it. The menu is way to big and I think the food quality suffers because of it."
Vu N.,"Raleigh, NC",0,5,,2.0,5/30/2014,The service was good. Our server was very nice and checked up on us frequently. The tables are too small to fit the good we ordered. I ordered the steak (cooked medium) and salmon. They were both overdone; the steak was well done and the salmon was very dry. Both were soaked in sauce to make up for the dry flavorless entrees. I'm sure the cheesecakes are good but I did not have any.
Sue P.,"Miami, FL",106,117,122,4.0,11/21/2010,"4 stars because I love their Sunday brunch!  It starts at 10am and ends at 2pm.  Typical Cheescake Factory restaurant though - the place gets way too packed.  For this reason, I get there bright and early before the church crowds begin to descend.   I should be at church too you say?  Well, if you tried their Monte Cristo Sandwich, you'd be sinning it up like me too.   It's crispy french toast stuffed with bacon, grilled ham, scrambled eggs, and melted Swiss cheese.     Can I get an AMEN?! Here are my faves in order : 1. Monte Cristo Sandwich 2. Baja Chicken Hash 3. French Toast Napolean 4. Crab Hash 5. Eggs Benedict It's a small menu but it includes all the breakfast favorites done the way that made them favorites in the first place.    I dare to say everything is yummy in their brunch menu.  So if you'd like to become a ""Brunch Connoisseur"", this Cheesecake Factory location is a great place to start.  Here is a link to their online menu.  Their brunch menu is page 18"
