Joseph V.,"Henderson, NV",24,146,2,3.0,1/16/2011,"I had Cheesecake Factory on my mind today.  So, tonight for dinner, I decided to mosey over to the Crabtree Mall and have dinner at the Cheesecake Factory. Wow, it kinda caught me off guard.  I think the whole town went to the Cheesecake Factory for dinner.  It was PACKED on a Sunday evening.  I mean, it was more pack than a can of sardines pack.  In addition, the wait list and the lines were at least 20-30 people deep.  No way in heck I would be able to wait for a table and have dinner here.  In addition, it was way too noisy for my taste -- feels like I was in a subway train station... so much commotion. Decided instead to order and have it in the hotel (peace and quiet).  Frustrating thing about the menu is that it offers so much variety.  If you haven't been here before, you kinda get lost or sort of ""intimidated"" with the menu itself.  Personally, they need to find a way to simplify their menu.   I normally order the Pad Thai shrimp.  Unfortunately, they no longer have it as part of their menu.  Instead, for an appetizer, I ordered the Buffalo Hot Wings.  And, for the entree, I ordered their specialty item, Jambalaya Shrimp Spicy Pasta to go. The order took about 15 minutes to get ready (pretty quick).  So, I took the time to walk around the restaurant and visit the restroom.  Surprisingly, the restroom was a mess.  Because of the volume of people in the restaurant, the management team failed to check on the lavatory conditions.  Bad mark here. Anyways, when I finally got the meal, I headed back to the hotel for dinner.  Here are the meal results: a.  Buffalo Wings - nice and plump.  However, I did not care for the heavy saturated flour and sauce.  Would have preferred that they serve it as a ""naked"" wing with the sauce either marinated with the wing or on the side.  The flour was not that good. b.  Jambalaya Shrimp Pasta - I asked the sauce to be served on the side.  Usually, they lather the pasta in this sauce and it is a bit overwhelming.  So, being that it was on the side, I was able to apply as much as needed.  The pasta and veggie mix was very good.  Even better, the shrimp was tender and had a heck of a spicy kick to it.  I really enjoyed this entree. The total came to about $40 (buffalo wings, jambalaya shrimp, diet coke, and a small ""order-out"" tip). Here are my ratings: The meal was fair - Buffalo wings ~ 2.5 stars, Jambalya shrimp ~ 4.5 stars.   The price was a bit pricey ~ 2.5-3 stars.   The crowded atmosphere and restroom conditions ~ 2 stars Enjoy"

Sonja B.,"Raleigh, NC",0,16,,1.0,3/31/2015,"Dinner at the Cheesecake Factory is always great, service was the worst!  Amanda is our waitress , bought cold bread and rock solid butter.  Never refilled glasses until asked.  We asked for more bread, by the time we received it, almost 12 min. we were done.  Your tip is contingent upon the service rendered; service is everything."
Regina T.,"Waldorf, MD",45,128,93,3.0,10/1/2011,"Was crowded as I expected on a weekend but we only waited 15 min to be seated. Had a veggie burger from their new menu and it was really good, took home a slice of cheesecake --- yum! I rated it as such because the table was seriously small and felt cramped...wish the Cheesecake Factory would redesign their seating so that it doesn't feel as claustrophobic."
Amber M.,"North Wilkesboro, NC",0,4,1,5.0,11/18/2013,My husband and I was in Raleigh for some business along with our daughters we had never tried this place before so we went based off the reviews of yelp. We was absolutely in love the inside is so fun and my girls loved it the food was great our waiter was great and the cheese cake was awesome we had left overs and only got the lunch size we will be returning here more often. It didn't disappoint also before we ordered the waiter brought our girls bananas cut up and bread and strawberry jam to keep them content  and anyone who has kids will understand how great that was!
Susu R.,"Greensboro, NC",63,29,4,4.0,11/16/2013,The Cheesecake factory is pretty much always a great choice for an amazing salad. I had the grilled ceasar salad and my friend had the spaghetti with meat sauce. I absolutely loved my salad and my friend really did not like her spaghetti. She said it was too dry. We had wine and a slice of caramel to share.  My salad was $17 and  wine was $8 a glass. The ambiance is always beautiful. My waitress was just ok but Im not gonna take off for that because everybody has a bad day. I will give Cheesecake Factory 4 stars because I love the food & cheesecakes!!!!
Donna B.,"Dallas, TX",117,567,404,3.0,7/27/2010,"Finally sat down for a meal in Cheesecake Factory, after years of having only cheesecake. The cheesecake, of course, gets five stars.  The rest of the establishment, however, well...I think this is one of those occasions when you run across a product that's done a really, really good PR job.  You know, one of those where you finally get the goods and wonder, ""What's all the hype about?"" or to make a really bad pun, ""All sizzle and no steak.""  Yes the cheesecake is worth the hype.  The rest of the restaurant, not so much.  Don't get me wrong, the food was good.  The menu is massive, probably more massive than it needs to be.  Let it be a hint to you that the menu has PAGE NUMBERS.  When was the last time you saw a restaurant menu so lengthy that it required page numbers?!  Once you wade through the many pages of appetizers, salads, pastas, entrees, steaks, seafood, etc. to choose something to eat, the food is good; I recommend asking for a box to take half of it home.  First of all, there's more food than you'll be able to eat, and secondly, you want to leave room for cheesecake.   Cheesecake Factory is one of the better eating spots at the mall, especially for those of us who don't want to go near the Food Court unless it's for something cold to drink.  Our wait to be seated was only five minutes and the service was good, although a bit slow a couple of times (they were busy).  I think I'll leave Cheesecake Factory on my ""for cheesecake only"" list."
Jeff S.,"Raleigh, NC",8,147,48,2.0,9/27/2010,"There is just nothing exciting about this place.  The menu is way way too big and most items way too bland. If they cut the menu by 2/3rds and focused on the most popular items they could be more consistent, efficient and easier for diners to navigate the menu. Warning: there is just as much advertising in the menu as food. For quality in Crabtree dining try PF Changs, Kanki, or Brio. Kanki is owned by the same group as the mall itself and is the most 'local' of the options mentioned above."
Josh F.,"Pendleton, IN",1,83,6,3.0,8/25/2013,As always the food is excellent but the service seemed off during our visit. We asked the waiter for something 3 times and each time they would leave as we would ask but then they would catch that we asked something and come back. I always love coming here but they get 3 stars due to the service only.
Michelle R.,"Ashburn, VA",0,11,,5.0,2/5/2014,"Love the Cheesecake factory in general! Went to this one while in town on business. Fast service, great food, all of what you would expect from a cheesecake factory. No wait times even during the normal dinner rush!"
Nancy H.,"Raleigh, NC",24,17,,3.0,6/20/2012,"It's an ok restaurant. The food is average, not memorable, the cheesecake is what I think people really go for. The wait for a table can be long, which is frustrating at times. The menu is way to long, I wish they would shorten their selection and stop trying to be something for everyone. It makes it difficult to order and maybe if they focused on a particular cuisine their quality of food would go up. There serving sizes are enormous, so I would recommend either sharing with someone or preparing to take half or more home with you. That being said, their cheesecake is pretty good. Aside from my own home-baked it is the only kind I have found that I like (although not quite as good as mine). Last time we went, we actually ate somewhere else and just stopped by to get cheesecake to go (I think that is the way I like to do this restaurant the most, avoids the long waits for tables, horribly designed menu etc.). The service is so-so. It is not a quiet place to eat, the decor is over the top (I think they were going for Italian renasaince) and parking can also be a problem since it is located at Crabtree."
Psalm S.,"Raleigh, NC",74,183,39,3.0,5/3/2010,"Three stars for the food that I did have on the 10,000 page menu, and four stars for the cheesecake. I'm not a cheesecake person ordinarily (except when my sister-in-law makes it), but I really like Cheesecake Factory's. My favorite--that I order time and time again--is the chocolate coconut cheesecake. So sinfully good. Other ones worth mentioning are the white chocolate macadamia nut, red velvet, and the Tuxedo. My husband and I enjoy sitting at the bar since we're usually forced to--this place is busy every second of every day it seems--and ordering a nice hot chocolate or coffee with a little whiskey to go with our slices. There's one chicken dish that is really good, and the fried artichoke hearts are amazing, but overall it's big, it's crowded, it's loud, it's kinda pricey. I don't mind a gift card from this place, but it's not normally on the top of my list."
Yubin J.,"Holly Springs, NC",0,2,,4.0,9/22/2013,Never can go wrong with this place. Super convenient to shopping and family friendly!
Sassy W.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",1,43,,4.0,1/6/2015,"This location is cool. If I come when it's busy, I go sit at the bar. Yes the menu is massive, but I lot of the food is pretty good. Lately I've been going with a bunch of small plates and appetizers. Pricey, but I have leftovers for later. My absolute fav item is the tex mex eggrolls. I never share them. I eat about 2-3 and take the rest home for later. My other fav small plates are: greek salad (skinny menu, needs lettuce tho), chicken & mushroom lettuce wraps (skinny menu), and stuffed mushrooms. My fav entrees are chicken di pana and grilled turkey burger. My fav cocktail is the passionfruit mojito. I'm not a huge cheesecake lover but i like to nibble on the red velvet cheesecake. Love coming here to indulge."
Noelle H.,"Wilmington, NC",26,79,36,3.0,11/23/2010,"I have a love/hate relationship with the Cheesecake Factory food chain. The atmosphere is nice and the waiters/waitresses are good -- but you have to be really careful what you order. Sometimes the food is delicious -- sometimes it tastes like a TV dinner.  I can tell you, however, that I love, love, love the red-velvet cheesecake dessert! It's to-die-for."
Johanna K.,"Durham, NC",42,35,2,3.0,2/24/2010,"I don't go to the mall often, actually I try to avoid it at all costs, but have been to Cheesecake Factory a few times. Food: Not bad if you can get past the ginormous menu and ever figure out what to order...I do love the lettuce wraps. Pretty sure they have some good Happy Hour specials too. Atmosphere: Sit at a bar table, so much more comfortable...and minus the overdressed servers....see Anna E's review. Drinks: It is a chain, so expect to pay.  Personally, not a chain fan so stay away if I can.  If I have to, I always find something I like."
Alex S.,"Biddleville, Charlotte, NC",2,1,,2.0,8/25/2014,"I always eat at the Cheesecake Factory on special occasions and other times but  last week I had a terrible experience. I was told by the Front Desk that the wait time is 50 minutes to an hour due to the number of people in my party so I said ok I will wait. After 90 minutes I approached the Front Desk and asked what's taking so long? I was told the wait was 50 to 60 minutes long, it is now 90 minutes. The Manager on duty (Dennis Cox or Knox) came over and he was not friendly or accommodating at all. He did not apologize, offer a free appetizer or even a discount. An apology would be good but he did not have it in him. He is not management material nor customer service friendly."
Harley C.,"Raleigh, NC",23,84,46,1.0,2/17/2012,everything tastes the same...and that's not a good thing.  Typical chain.
Sharanya S.,"Las Vegas, NV",7,11,22,4.0,5/29/2014,"Love love love this place .. Lots of options to choose from .. Every dish is delicious ! N some are fusion of two different cuisines .. N cheese cakes , no need to say yummmm !!"
