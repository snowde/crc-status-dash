Brenna B.,"Fuquay-Varina, NC",478,22,,3.0,2/17/2012,"I personally think this restaurant is over rated.  The food is just okay...I have frequent several different Cheesecake factories and never have I left blown away at my experience.  The ambience is okay...but sometimes a little too dark.  The seating arrangements are like, an upscale cafeteria. I don't like eating with people who I don't know.  The customer service is the saving grace for this restaurant.  Most of my friends love this spot, so that's why I go."
Sheri D.,"Apex, NC",29,2,1,1.0,6/29/2014,"At there on 6/28/2014 this is my forth visit there and probably my last.  In the past I have had great service, yesterday the service sucked! We got seated quickly, then the waitress took 10 minutes to come over. She was quick to bring drinks back, but took forever to take our order even though she came out twice bringing food to a table and the check to the table across from us.  When our order finally was taken it took over and hour to get it out to us and they forgot my plate! It took the manager 10 minutes to get over to the table to apology for the delay. Of course they did comp our meals. And 10 more minutes for me to get food. Told my mom and sister in the meantime to eat since their food was getting cold. Her tuna was over cooked and the crust wasn't crusty but soggy.   The only up side is that the cheesecake that I got to go was awesome, of cousrse let's hope that a restaurant named the Cheesecake Factory would get that right!!! My main issue is the excuse that it was all to blame on the kitchen. I saw some waitress' that could be a better job. And a manger that shouldn't have taken that long to come out and apologize  at my table.  I have worked in the restaurant business  and always hate that the kitchen gets blamed  for everything maybe if the menu wasn't soooo large the staff could have an easier time getting food out!  Also management has to be in command of the staff and it looked to me like they were clueless.  We were clued in that I wasn't the only one who wasn't get food. There seemed to be a lot of partial tickets going out. And that's a big no no in food service. If I go back I think I'll stick to the cheesecake and skip the food!"
Joshua B.,"Fort Bragg, NC",322,2,,5.0,11/17/2012,Loved it hands down very good service and very good food i would recommend that place to any one who llike class good food and great desert
Lois R.,"Colorado Springs, CO",273,46,1,4.0,6/20/2012,Yummy! I love this place. They have so many things and I never get tired of any of it. I love the dynamite shrimp. Now it is expensive and if you are on a diet good luck finding healthy things to eat. They say they have diet friendly options but really don't. Now I must be honest here...I have not had the cheesecake yet. I am usually too full after my meal to attempt it.
Jason C.,"Raleigh, NC",1,4,3,3.0,7/20/2014,Food was great. Waitress was courteous. A little pricey but expected. I would have given higher rating but hostess who worked was very arrogant and a b*tch. She needs customer service training 101
Amber H.,"Enid, OK",22,52,83,4.0,9/23/2009,"We came on a Saturday for lunch. It was very busy, we waited for about 30 mins.  We were seated & started looking thru the menu. Had alot of choices! We all had 4 that we were considering. I had steak Diana, loved it! Great flavor, steaks were cooked perfectly. Mom got the cheese crusted chicken w/pasta- very good the sauce was kinda tame for her but still yummy. Dad had gumbo-very good, a little spicy but that's how gumbo is right?! Waitress was great! Very energetic, even tho it was a busy day.  Had 3 cheesecakes to share that we took home cuz we had no room left. Adams cheesecake-peanut butter type- great!  Kaluah cheesecake-coffee type-OMG! So good!! Red velvet & cheesecake-really good! Nice and moist cake to go with the cheesecake.  Overall really great experience!"
Jeevan P.,"Fremont, CA",3,11,2,2.0,3/10/2014,We had to wait 40 mins for our table and person managing table allocation was rude to my friend. Her manager had to step in to calm things down. Also service was average. I have visited other cheesecake factory locations and they were much better in terms of hospitality and service!
Steve T.,"Commerce Township, MI",2,27,,3.0,9/27/2009,"Came here for dinner, was not particularly hungry at the time and ordered a salad for dinner. Was average, nothing great and nothing disappointing...."
Tara H.,"Clayton, NC",61,50,,4.0,7/31/2011,My oh my a day of indulgence that was! Shopping spree ended at cheesecake factory where I had only been one other time. I ordered a chicken special w pasta and it was fabulous ! I'm not a big cheesecake fan but the server talked me into white chocolate raspberry with a raspberry sauce....awesome !!!!!!
Sara L.,"Raleigh, NC",24,131,16,3.0,9/22/2011,"Every Cheesecake Factory is pretty much the same but this one is in a very nice location being attached to the crabtree mall. I love the fried mac and cheese balls even though they are well over 1,000 calories. Don't come here if you are trying to be a health nut.. you won't leave satisfied unless you go over to the dark side for a bit. Also love the green iced tea and the fried zucchini!"
C M.,"San Diego, CA",1,293,169,5.0,4/13/2011,"My favorite restaurant of all time! Ive been to the Cheesecake factory in California, North Carolina and Hawaii and its all been amazing. The Miso Salmon is to die for. The Avacado Egg Rolls is to die for. The 30th Anniversary Chocolate Cake Cheesecake is to die for. AMAZING!"
Holly S.,"Salisbury, NC",32,7,1,4.0,6/21/2012,"When I went to The Cheesecake Factory for the second time, I expected that the food would be excellent (I don't remember what it was like the first time I went).  I found out how wrong I was.  I was so hungry that I wanted something that I thought I would probably like.  I saw that they had fried macaroni and cheese on there menu.  It sounded good and so I decided to try it.  It wasn't what I expected.  It wasn't the worst food I've ever had, but it wasn't my favorite either.  However, the cheesecake did kind of make up for it.  It was delicious!  I'll definitely go back there...for the cheesecake!"
D H.,"Raleigh, NC",76,35,10,4.0,9/1/2011,"Great pasta and cheesecake!  Not a fan of the seating arrangement for the most part and a few items are not my favorite but I enjoy it a lot.  Service is always good, and the anniversary cake can not be beat.  So I like it!!"
Jake P.,"Washington, DC",31,76,59,1.0,3/4/2011,"I hate this one the one at the streets at southpoint is so much better here. I went  here with my friend and I was supremely disappointed, it was like a soup kitchen, they crammed us in a corner with about four inches between tables, the food was crap. It just seemed dirty yuck. I am so disappointed in this place"
Nita D.,"Cary, NC",0,28,1,5.0,9/28/2013,"Love this place! The service is great and I really like the happy hour appetizer specials. Nice atmosphere, always crowded so be prepared to wait a bit but still good stuff! Will be back again."
Nicole K.,"Vancouver, WA",0,4,,4.0,8/9/2011,"My past experiences with the Cheesecake Factory have only been with their yummy cheesecake. However, I went to the Cheesecake Factory for lunch with my cousin and her daughter on my last trip to Raleigh. I enjoyed a delicious lunch special with a white pizza and salad. The portion was huge and gave me plenty to share with the table and take home for left overs. My cousin had the lunch pasta carbonara and loved it as well. The only disappointment was that we were too full for dessert."
Tripp W.,"South Boston, Boston, MA",60,239,579,3.0,3/18/2010,"I am not big on chain restaurants, but CCF is a solid choice for a sit down place when eating at Crabtree Mall.  The wait.  OMG.  The wait.  This place is packed from the time they open the doors to the time they push people out.  I just don't get it.  The shortest wait I have ever had is 45 min, but on the bright side, they give you a pager that you can roam around a limited part of the mall.  Once you get seated, the service is pretty good.  The wait staff is running all over the place, but someone is normally there when needed.  The menu is huge and it is very hard to pin down what your in the mood for.  Everything I have ever ordered here has been tasty and a GIANT portion.  So to wrap up.  Good food, but extremely busy and loud."
Elena L.,"Johns Island, SC",0,27,7,4.0,9/4/2010,"Whenever I come to Raleigh for dog shows (March and Sept) I always go to the Cheesecake factory for lunch (go early as they fill up fast for lunch and dinner).  The items I love are:  the Viet. shrimp Spring rolls, Sheila's Cashew Asian salad, and the Four Season Pizza.  In the past, I have tried the avocado spring rolls  and the fried macaroni & cheese balls, but just did not care for them,  So, I stick with those 3 things and am always happy.  Their lime marguarita is good too and the cheese cake is always outstanding.  One of my favs is the key lime cheesecake - YUM!!"
Gwendolyn M.,"Saint Louis, MO",40,87,1,4.0,1/23/2011,"Skip the wait and grab one of the tall tables near the bar.  They're first come, first serve and the waitresses are always super friendly.  I am so in love with the Bellini."
A L.,"Fayetteville, NC",3,30,9,3.0,3/22/2010,"After an hour drive & another hour waiting...we finally had the cheesecake experience. I had the miso salmon & tried the Kahlua cheesecake & banana cream w/c were all tasty but definitely nothing to die for. I did appreciate the GINORMOUS portions of food! I was shocked at the kids' portions...1 kids pizza plate could've fed my whole ""army""! Overall, it didn't quite live up to the hype. It satisfied our curiousity, but not quite our appetites."
