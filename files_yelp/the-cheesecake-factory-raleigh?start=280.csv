Larry G.,"Capitol Heights, MD",362,626,10,3.0,6/2/2008,"I've always like Cheesecake Factory.  However, I make it a rare treat since they serve large heapings of food as if there's no tomorrow. I usually have the Orange Chicken when I dine here.  However, I thought I'd try something different with their lunch specials/portions.  So, I ordered the Crusted Chicken Romano. It was...alright.  It's just angel hair pasta accompanied with a long, thin, breaded piece of chicken.  So, naturally, I was disappointed. And the lunch portion...you could have fooled me.  It looked exactly like their regular serving portions. The decor was nice but confusing.  You'll spot Egyptian motifs but with arts from another era.  The fusion is nice though."
Viola W.,"Charlotte, NC",0,3,,1.0,4/8/2014,"I wouldn't even give this place one star if I could. My family and I went there on 04/05/2014 and had the worst time ever. We love cheesecake factory in Charlotte, NC, Virginia, and in DC where we have family as well. We went there to celebrate a birthday for my uncle who is one of the pillars of our family. First, the people here told my cousin that they don't take reservations when she called a week ahead of time and the day of in the morning when they opened, which is a lie, because again, we go there all the time and all of the cheesecake factories take reservations. So when the rest of the family got there which was 10 minutes later, we still had to wait 30 minutes. My family party was about 12-15 people, they tried to sit us down in two separate areas. I don't know what they were thinking. 6 people would sit on the far left side of the restaurant and the rest on the right side. We are celebrating a birthday at a restaurant for God's sake. Then the young lady in front that was seating individuals, with red long hair, had a very nasty attitude and was down right rude. Well my mother talked to her like she had some sense somewhere and informed her that we are here to patronize the restaurant. She didn't pay attention to us at all because we were of color, however, the individuals of white American decent were seated and handled in the utmost manner. NOT ACCEPTABLE. We actually know some of the board of trustees and partners as well as investors in the restaurant. Not to throw names around, but again, we go there almost once or twice a week, so this was horrible. Needless to say, the manager, a guy who seemed as though he had no clue of being a manager tried to seat us in two booths. Not only were we annoyed, we were furious. We just sat down to get the dinner over with vowing to never come back. We sat down in two booths that were back to back and the food was simply nasty and uneatable. Example, my sister and I had a steak, salmon, and shrimp dinner and I had salmon and the salmon was small like 2 inches long and 3 inches wide. The steak was hard, nasty, and not seasoned. We look over to the left of us and there was a reservation for a party of 20 full of teenagers and kids; but I thought you don't do reservations. The only positive to this place was the server. She was so friendly and we gave her a great tip! Cheesecake factory in Crabtree, please listen, many of your members who are somewhat invested in your company and patronize it have already sent a letter, phone calls, emails, and etc. to let them know how disgusted we were to have even been treated like that. This review may not go anywhere, or it might, who is to say, but I WOULD NOT EVER GO TO CHEESECAKE FACTORY IN CRABTREE MALL IN RALEIGH, NC EVER AGAIN AND I DON'T RECOMMEND ANYONE ELSE DOES EITHER...THEY ARE PREJUDICE, RACISTS, AND CUSTOMER SERVICE IS NOT EVEN ALIVE IN THE ATMOSPHERE!"
Genevieve G.,"Raleigh, NC",1,11,,4.0,5/20/2013,other than the mall traffic I love the cheesecake factory for it's variety of foods and of course the fantastic strawberry cheesecake
Haoward B.,"Fort Bragg, NC",100,8,,4.0,9/6/2010,The food was great but the wait was kinda long. but overall the Cheese Cake was fantastic.
Kevin D.,"Raleigh, NC",4,14,,3.0,8/23/2012,"I feel like the Cheesecake factory neither garners high praise, nor elicits any hyper negative comments. You get what you pay for, it's always solid. If you want to spend a little more for a chain restaurant experience, than this is a good place to go. The recipes are always solid, they may not be super high quality, but they are always well prepared. Also, you can never go wrong with their wide selection of cheesecake, I mean, they ARE the cheesecake FACTORY."
Chris E.,"Raleigh, NC",0,104,5,5.0,11/18/2012,Fantastic service. They do everything you can imaging to make sure you are a satisfied customer. Great menu with many of my favorites.
Melanie D.,"Mountain View, CA",41,203,1,3.0,2/3/2006,"The only time I ever go to the Cheesecake Factory is when my friend, Lisa, is in town.  It's our little thing - laugh a little, talk a little, eat a little.  We always try to save room for dessert (OBVIOUSLY!), so typically we eat an appetizer for our main  course.  I like the avacado egg rolls a lot, they are relatively light and come with a delicious sweet nutty sauce.   The few times I have ventured into full-fledged entree land, I was unimpressed although this could be because  1) I ordered fish tacos and they came loaded with red cabbage, which I completely hate. 2) The food is solidly made and delicious but can be overpriced. 3) It left me too full to enjoy dessert, my favorite part of any meal! If I order cheesecake, it's the ever-popular white chocolate raspberry or the Toblerone.  However, their cheesecake is extremely rich (as New York style cheesecake is) and I am not often in the mood for it.  Their other desserts are wonderful, such as their tiramisu and their ice cream sundaes.  Definitely save room if you order a non-cheesecake dessert:  they are filling and the portions are large.  The cheesecake slices can be buried under the two puffballs of whipped cream, which I think is part of the way they make the slice seem more exciting than it actually is. Also, another note, for a restaurant that goes for the upscale dining experience, it's very loud and crowded.  I would have expected something a bit more lowkey.  And since it's so new to the Triangle, the waits are disgustingly long at key hours. PROS:  Good food, great desserts, attentive wait staff. CONS:  Long waits at peak hours, overpriced, lots of heavy cream and calories."
M C.,"Raleigh, NC",1,8,,2.0,7/22/2013,"This location absolutely cannot accommodate their takeout customers. Ordered food for dinner yesterday (Sunday 7/21/13). Were told it would be twenty minutes. Didn't even leave home for twenty minutes, figuring we'd have to wait like usual. Boy was that right. We waited in the designated parking spots 15 minutes...no employees came out to acknowledge any customers/cars during that time.  (All spots were filled). Called their takeout number to  make certain they knew cars were waiting. It was almost another 15 minutes, and another car's order came out before ours, and they were the last vehicle to arrive. I didn't blame it on the poor girl who finally ran out with our orders, I blame it on poor management and poor staffing during busy times. Do not offer carry out if you cannot accommodate those customers in a timely manner. By the time we got home, we had soggy sandwiches. Watched one couple go in to grab their food themselves. It took them forever as well. You're a popular establishment, and you need to pick up the slack."
Hiromi N.,"San Francisco, CA",429,986,199,3.0,1/14/2007,"Eh...it's a chain and is consistent.  It was a big deal when the restaurant first opened in Raleigh and accordingly it got a lot of hype.  Yet, there are better local restaurants in the area, so I would definitely only suggest that you come here if you want to fight the tourist crowd and noise for a great slice of dessert or if you need a shopping break."
K M.,"Wake Forest, NC",0,18,,3.0,3/2/2013,"I am not overly impressed with the Cheesecake Factory. Don't get me wrong, if I was ordering just the cheesecake they would get high praise, but as a restaurant with a full menu for what you pay, you just do not get your money's worth. I think the menu is to big. After an hour wait, we were sat and it took the waiter about 20 minutes to deliver our drinks, a glass of wine, my drink a 7 and 7 and a few soft drinks. We ordered the appetizer, the Chicken Samosas, wafers wrapped with spicy chicken, served with a cilantro dipping sauce. It was pretty good. My wife had the meatloaf which she thought was pretty good. I had the Salisbury Chopped Steak with mashed potatoes. The food was good, but it did not wow me. In all honesty I think you can get the same quality food at a chain like Chili's or Applebees for 1/'2 the price. The money we spent at Cheesecake was not a dining experience. For the same amount we could have eaten at the Melting Pot and been wowed. The tuxedo cheese cake, chocolate mouse cheese cake was great. Just an average dining experience as it always is at Cheesecake. I think a lot of people give Cheesecake high praise based on it's reputation for having great desserts then being a great restaurant"
Tracy A.,"Oakland, CA",480,1323,605,3.0,2/10/2008,Good brownie dessert.  We met some extended family here for a large family dinner on my recent vacation and first time in NC.  I haven't eaten in a Cheesecake factory in about 10 years.  The portions are as large as I remember.
