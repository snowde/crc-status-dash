Rosanna G.,"Raleigh, NC",0,13,1,1.0,11/6/2017,"Awful experience at CCF. Order Thai Lime Chicken dish, was served some Shrimp Pineapple dish. I'm allergic to pineapple. Waited 25 minutes more to get my meal which was full of onions even though I spelled it out clearly I'm also allergic to onions so no onions. When I complained the manager was a jerk. There was a line to talk to the manager so that tells you alot. One guy said he placed a to go order and was still waiting 1 hour later. Kitchen is mismanaged, staff is not well trained.  Although I love the cheesecake, you won't catch me eating there again."
Pamela Y.,"Raleigh, NC",38,7,3,4.0,3/30/2017,I love the place not only for their cheesecake but for the food and yummy drinks. I've never had a bad meal. It's a common meeting spot after work or for birthday celebrations.
Viki N.,"Benson, NC",21,14,20,3.0,8/20/2017,"Well my experience there started out great. I was excited because I haven't been in awhile and I loved their mega menu selections. So it took a little time to get our meal. My husband got his before me. I ordered a pasta dish. When it came I needed a little salt and I picked up the shaker and shook it. When my husband looked up he noticed the glass salt shaker was actually broken at the bottom! Not knowing if I had broken glass in my pasta, the waiter apologized and took it back. I suppose a manager came out also and apologized for the mishap and said they were preparing me another meal. Great. I enjoyed a portion of it and the remainder was boxed so I could take it home along with my key lime cheesecake. My disappointment was in the fact that I wasn't offered anything other than an apology for potentially swallowing glass along with my pasta! If my husband had not looked up chances are I would not have known. Food and service get 1 star each and customer care and goodwill get NOTHING! I didn't expect a discount, but just think it would have been considerate if they had offered something!"
Olivia D.,"Fuquay Varina, NC",9,3,,2.0,3/4/2017,"Service was bad. Food was okay.  We scheduled a reservation at 5:30, and hung out at the mall until our table was ready. We finally reached the point of being SUPER HUNGRY, so we went at 8:30 (three hours after we scheduled our reservation). We then stood in the foyer until 9, and because no one was helping us to our seat, we decided to seat ourselves at the table we had reserved. The table was set, and clean, yet we were told that the table ""wasn't ready."" We didn't actually get to sit until 9:15. We didn't get our bread until at least 9:45, and we didn't receive our food until 10:30ish. The food gave me SEVERE heartburn, and was just okay overall. I would reccomend The Melting Pot over this joint. It's within the same price range, but the food and service are WAY better."
Michael G.,"Seattle, WA",7,285,,1.0,1/7/2017,"The cheesecake factory these days looks and tastes like the food is made in a bad factory, and is on a landslide of poor quality. My wife and I are literally sick in our stomachs later the same day after a meal at the Cheesecake Factory.  This is the the second time being sick after eating at a triangle cheesecake factory branch within the last three months.  The dirty and dusty mirrors in our booth didn't add anything to the experience either. The beef dip sandwiches we got trying to redeem from our last bad experience were again gristly, fatty, scrappy, non uniform pieces of disgusting looking meat... almost as bad as their sister restaurant last time we visited. What are they doing in the kitchens these days at this chain?  What a waste of time and money going there for such marginal product.  I hope I learned my lesson to really stay away this time, as I don't believe this restaurant is good for my health or well being...  I used to really like the brand in the old days, but in their growth, they have really lost their way..."
William V.,"Farmville, VA",19,83,4,4.0,11/24/2016,"My wife and I went here twice for my 54th birthday in 2016. We had supper the night before my birthday, and cheesecake for brunch on my birthday. This restaurant is a magnificent building built into the Crabtree Vally Mall.  The service and food are excellent. The only reason I'm docking this restaurant a star is that it is crowded and noisy, which, presumably, is a result of its excellence and subsequent popularity."
Charda H.,"Raleigh, NC",10,13,29,5.0,7/18/2017,Ate here yesterday for dinner...was a little skeptical bc I've had two previous bad experiences ...This time around I ordered with caution lol ...I got the Chicken Madeira loved it!!! Sauce with the chicken was delish...I also ordered a Blueberry Mojito...yummy..my waiter was great she made good recommendations and informed me well about meals I had questions on...Great made up for my past two bad experiences!
Sharice L.,"Raleigh, NC",1,33,6,2.0,7/3/2017,"Definitely becoming an overrated spot to eat at Crabtree. The best part was the hostess who was working by herself to host, and seat people as they came pouring in for happy hour at 4 pm. The half off apps really mean just the small plate items which I didn't become aware of til it was time to pay. The stuffed mushrooms were ok but not great. The salad with the pizza/salad combo was warm and did not seem fresh. I asked for a substitute of broccoli instead which had pasta mixed in it too. The buffalo strips without the sauce were good and a good portion size. The pizza I had was the everything pizza that seemed like it was not baked all the way. I did not bother with dessert especially since our server got missing for long periods of time. This place is a prime example of going for the name not for the quality. No pics for there was nothing that was worth capturing."
Clay D.,"Portland, OR",0,29,,5.0,1/5/2017,Great as always. Portions are huge so split something or get a take home box. Well you could gain 2-3 pounds but that's on you - ha ha. So many excellent choices in meals and desserts.  I'm sure we will go back when visiting Raleigh.
Becky H.,"Raleigh, NC",1,23,7,1.0,7/23/2017,"It was our first time EVER going to a Cheesecake Factory restaurant and we will NEVER be back! Our waitress only had 4 table 3 two tops and a 3 top....She took our order and then disappeared from sight, next we saw of her was when she asked ""was everything okay?"" Then she disappeared again.....next time we saw her she brought us our check.....our drinks NEVER stayed full...we were there for 2 hours and I had 1 drink, empty glass stayed empty and was never asked if I would like it refilled.....On the way out we spoke to the general manager and he listened to what we had to say, but he didn't try to rectify the situation or ask that we give them another try......nothing! We definitely won't be back and I think everyone in that restaurant should take customer service and people skills classes....."
Jane B.,"Raleigh, NC",5,20,11,3.0,6/16/2017,Excellent service. Really big menu with perhaps too many options. I got the fried Mac and cheese balls as a starter and four cheese pasta for my entree.  And a cocktail. The cocktail was delicious. The pasta was a little overcooked and bland with an unimpressive afterthought of dry parsley tossed on it. I'd probably recommended sticking with their dessert or appetizer menu here. I would definitely recommend Dem fried Mac and cheese ballz doe.  They were defreakinglicious.
Chris H.,"Denver, CO",113,694,11,4.0,10/22/2016,Cheesecake Factories are always consistent in their food and their atmosphere. This one was no different. I went here for dessert and while you may assume that I had cheesecake...I didn't. Most people don't know that the Cheesecake Factory makes THE best hot fudge Sunday that you can get.
Fefe B.,"Aberdeen, NC",21,20,86,4.0,11/16/2016,I went with a group from work! First I would like to say that the ambience was absolutely amazing and every thing was very clean and busy without being overwhelming. The decor reminded me of beautiful wall to ceiling painting from the times of old Rome. I ordered he blue berry mojito which was so tasty because they didn't skimp on the fresh blueberries and the mint & liquor came through. For Dinner I ordered the steak Diane & chicken Madeira with mashed potatoes. I ordered my steak medium but it was cooked more on the well done side. Still delicious but too well for me. Usually it is cooked perfectly. The chicken Madeira stole the show and I could not get enough. Then I finished everything off with an Oreo Dream cheesecake. Oh my God it is to die for! Oh and the service was great too. Food came out in a good time and never felt rushed.
Angelique A.,"Livermore, CA",148,264,167,4.0,2/11/2016,"Best big chain restaurant: excellent service, huge splittable portions, local beers on tap and large whiskey/spirit pours. Their menu is huge and there are so many flavors of cheesecake to choose from: if you like sweet I highly recommend the key lime mango and if you like chocolate the tiramisu is fluffy and cocoa dusted."
Kristin K.,"Clayton, NC",0,17,,4.0,11/23/2016,I really like the Cheesecake Factory. My favorite dish is the Chicken Belagio. I also love the triple chocolate truffle tower cake. That's probably not the actual name but you can figure it out. There are many benefits to the Cheesecake factory.  They have small plates if you want to try a few different things or you aren't really hungry.  They have a large number of dishes in general to choose from so everyone should be able to find something they like.  I also find that the portion sizes generally allow for me to take half home and have that meal again for lunch the next day. I find its a great value for the money. This is a great place to have dinner and also a great place to come just for dessert. Or take it all to go and enjoy it in the comfort if your own house. My only negative is the wait time on weekends and the fact that they don't take reservations.  Overall I highly recommend this restaurant.
Maryammalle P.,"Garden Grove, CA",5,35,16,3.0,7/31/2017,"Don't get me wrong, I love Cheesecake Factory but my last experience was so below par of what my usual dining experience. I came in on Sunday around 12:50 and was told by the hostess who barely looked at me that the wait was an hour for 5. I didn't mind since it was national cheesecake day and I expected it. What I didn't like was the fact that she was a hostess but was not friendly at all. I'm sure she was just overwhelmed.  So we ended up walking around the mall for 35 minutes before heading back and as soon as we got back, our buzzer went off, awesome! The Asian girl that sat us was not very pleasant. She was rude in how she spoke to us. I had a stroller, my son is 5 months old. I had asked for a sling so I would be parking my stroller but it was how she spoke to me that got me. It wasn't friendly at all. I told her I would take just the car seat as long as they had the sling I requested. She said to park it near the bar and proceeded to rush me in while my friend parked my stroller. I told her I wanted to wait for my friend so we could walk in together. She seemed a little irritated. When we got to the table, no sling but it was a booth so I opted out since the car seat would fit into the booth with me and my 4 year old. Anyhow, I ended up asking my server for a sling to make it more comfortable. By the way, my server was awesome. Super nice and attentive. As we began to eat, the same Asian girl walked by to seat another family and this time, there was a man in a wheelchair so she needed more space and instead of asking us to move the sling, she TOLD us to move it out of the way for the man. She was rather rude and seemed irritated that we had a sling there. Luckily, I was nursing my son so he wasn't in the sling and we moved it somewhat under the table.  This girl is not meant to work in service. She's not very nice for a job that requires her to interact with people. I understand it was very crowded but you should still be courteous to all your patrons cause it's your job! She was just pushy and it left a bad taste in my mouth.  Like I said, I love Cheesecake Factory and have always had a great experience but this last one was not good. The hostesses are the first impression of a restaurant. Someone really needs to talk to this girl. She looks young and inexperienced. Maybe some more lessons in customer service would benefit her."
Aaron B.,"Raleigh, NC",171,130,58,3.0,7/25/2016,This visit saw me and a guest stopping in for some friend bonding over a couple of well drinks.  I rarely am in the mood for drinks but this once I decided to live a little.  The bartender informed me they were out of the mix needed for the drink I wanted but offered to make me an alternative.  It was a little disappointing but the drinks I were served were pretty good.  I was on a pineapple kick and wanted something to remind me of some good days spent in the tropics.  I wasn't disappointed however the tab made me think it would have been cheaper to actually GO to the tropics.  Oh well.  Can't win them all.
Christina L.,"Winston-Salem, NC",293,518,1894,5.0,12/29/2014,"This is one of their seasonal cheesecakes, offered only during the fall (October/November), $7.50. Top half is pumpkin pie cheesecake, bottom half is pecan pie, complete with a sweet praline topping. Absolutely amazing, just like most of their other cheesecake options. They might be sugary and unhealthy, but I just can't get enough of Cheesecake Factory's cheesecakes! Remember, you can't look at the calorie count when you come to a place like this! Came here specifically for dessert, and dessert only. Even in the short time I was here, which was near closing, this location still provided excellent service. Big parking lot available. Venue looks just as glorious as any of their other locations."
Dana S.,"Fuquay Varina, NC",13,15,3,4.0,5/29/2017,"This location is pretty good. Normally a 30 minute or more wait if you don't get their early, so we try to go soon after they open. It's a chain so the food always tastes the same, but I think the servers here are nice and accommodating.  They keep our drinks filled and they are friendly. Never had a problem here and I've been here tons of time"
Tom C.,"Torrance, CA",0,10,,4.0,9/6/2017,I had the most enjoyable  experience  here.and it started and ended  with our server RYAN. Good food great service  great total experience.
