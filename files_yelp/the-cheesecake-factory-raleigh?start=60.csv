Lois L.,"Garland, TX",2,75,,3.0,4/8/2017,"Not much of a wait for dinner on a weekday. I ordered the ahi tuna and it was cooked perfectly. However, the salad had some wilted lettuce in there and the passion fruit margarita was just okay. Nice ambience and our waitress was great but overall the food was alright."
David K.,"Henderson, NC",1,15,,1.0,4/23/2017,Waited 3 hours for a table. Terribly loud in there and the people were packed in like sardines. Food was excellent but I will probably never go to that restaurant again
G. P.,"Morrisville, NC",19,73,106,4.0,9/9/2016,"I wrote off the Cheesecake Factory years ago. I've only been twice I can think of. Even though the menu is as large as a websters dictionary I could never find anything there I liked. Well, my co-worker told me to get the chicken Bellagio. OMG!!! I'll be back!"
H. W.,"Virginia Beach, VA",1,95,183,5.0,12/7/2015,Great place here. I had the Cajun Chicken Little. A lot of chicken for $16. I think I may try that selection again. The sides were good as well. First time trying that corn stough I had. Lol. For dessert I had the Lemon Cheesecake with Raspberry drizzle; The Best!  Great location here at Crab Tree Mall. As always a little dim but that's okay! Our server Angela P was awesome. So ask for her whenever you come to this location.  As always you get what you pay for at the Cheesecake Factory. One of my Top 3 places for the price.
Matthew S.,"Apex, NC",0,3,1,1.0,8/29/2017,"I wanted to express my disappointment for the service provided during our visit. We dined with another couple and had our 18 month old baby with us. The appetizers (only two) took twenty minutes and then the entrees almost another 20+. When the entrees came out, they brought my wife's and one of the other two people's but not mine or the other person's. They brought out the third entree 10 minutes later and mine never came. Also, the third entree was cold and had to be sent back. I had to wait another 15 minutes before receiving my meal. The manager apologized and took my meal off the bill but at this point I was very hungry and our daughter was very fussy. We haven't been there in a while but we won't be back. Not only did the food not arrive at the same time for all guests (very rude) but the quality was bad and there was no concern for us being with a small child."
Cierra C.,"Angier, NC",0,25,,3.0,4/14/2017,"The cheese cake is to die for, My boyfriend and I enjoying stopping by for a slice! My only complaint is my boyfriends wallet was stolen here and we are convinced it was one of the employees who were making purchases on his personal card."
Daisy A.,"Kaka'ako, Honolulu, HI",0,4,16,1.0,11/15/2015,"Bad experience on friday* Pineapple was old, thin and not sweet at all, Piña Colada was nasty! With no sweet taste, it had the taste of coconut milk which is not sweet at all... The rim was covered with something that seemed like some type of cookie crumb.... Not impressed! Corn tamale cakes are usually good but this pushed in mark on my tamale cake seemed like someone tried to check it to see if it was done... Smh!  Will not be returning to this location...."
Carol Z.,"Garner, NC",0,2,,1.0,3/21/2017,"Not a great start to a wonderful evening out with friends, ordered From the half price menu via the waitress but when the bill came only one of the four was  happy hour  Priced.the rest were full priced with a half serving. And 11.00 dinks that were watered down,no thanks."
Leonel F.,"Woodbridge, VA",1,15,,1.0,11/3/2017,"Here we are on the day of my 23rd birthday and we made the mistake of coming to this establishment. Don't come here if you expect great service and food. If you aren't hungry, don't care for human interaction, and love getting dirty looks then by all means come here. We arrived and asked for a booth instead of the area where we were being seated. The woman told us it would be a 10-15 minute wait BUT she seated a group of Caucasian women at a booth just 2 minutes after we were told to wait. We were 4 people and they were 4. So we waited at the bar and ordered appetizers. It took about another 20 before we received them and by that point we were wondering who our server was. We finally asked the gentleman who helped us earlier at the bar if he was our server and he said yeah but never told us until we asked. We ordered pineapple mojitos which were really good but that's about it. I asked for a sprite and didn't receive it until the food came out which was about 3 minutes later. We then ordered our food and when we FINALLY got it. we were shocked to see how small it was. The portions here were RIDICULOUS compared to Virginia. We ordered steak medallions and the entire plate of food was a cup. A CUP OF FOOD AND THE MUSHROOMS HAD A TERRIBLE SMELL AND TASTE AND THEY WERE BURNT!!! Our server Mike only came around about 4 3 times and left so quick that we weren't able to tell him anything we needed. We also had let him know it was my birthday and expected to be treated like the table of women across from us who was given a proper happy birthday from Cheesecake; unfortunately once we paid the bill Mike came back with a poor excuse of a happy birthday song which he SAID himself and it was melted whipped cream. He claimed to be backed up but the place was empty. The service was terrible and ruined my birthday. I don't think I can trust this establishment ever again. Either JT or Sam (the African American manager) came by when we complained and they did absolutely nothing. Not even a sorry. I suggest you choose wisely in case you want to eat somewhere. Don't come here. Horrible."
Asiya N.,"Rolesville, NC",0,62,30,3.0,6/16/2016,"Well, its a nice place for groups I would say. Nice place overall. Loud ambiance, lots of children and birthdays with songs going on though .  Food; our waiter was nice but, brought us our wrong order twice, the portions are ridiculously large like enough to feed 3 ppl per portion. And portions that big cam often make you loose your appetite.  I would return here once in a blue moon maybe."
Kiran T.,"Charlotte, NC",86,11,8,4.0,8/17/2016,"The ambiance: Went in with the wife for a Sunday lunch. We had to wait for a good 25 minutes to get a table. I felt the table was in quite a tight spot as it was really busy and we couldn't have a decent conversation among all the chaos.  The service: We've never had to wait for long as the service was prompt. I believe, if you just slip by your tables and no one notices you come and go, you are good at your job as a waiter. The food: Need I say anything else about the factory food. Its as good as it always is. And now to my favorite part,  The Cheesecake: We ordered an Oreo cheese cake and I felt it was too sweet and boring after a point. Should have ordered a Classic cheese cake instead."
Wanca P.,"Raleigh, NC",0,33,,5.0,8/13/2017,Great food always hot excellent staff always welcoming. No matter what you order always excellent. I keep going love it
Babette P.,"Raleigh, NC",0,10,2,1.0,3/10/2017,"Hostess said it would be one hour and fifteen minutes to be seated and it took over two hours to get seated with no apologies. The waitress never came to check on the table. It took over half an hour to get the food. With five children under 10, who became very tired and hungry from waiting, it made for a very long night. Not the birthday dinner I had planned for my daughter. Very disappointing, especially since the restaurant staff did not seem overly concerned about our situation."
Jennifer B.,"Danville, VA",18,10,3,2.0,11/22/2016,"We started with the spinach dip which was bland. We traded entrees around the table until everyone found something they liked. Must of the entrees were bland, and tasteless. The only saving grace is the cheesecake. Not an impressive evening."
Vu N.,"Raleigh, NC",152,275,858,3.0,11/5/2015,"I ordered a slice of pumpkin pecan cheesecake to go. It's a special flavor for October and November, and I had to try it during pumpkin season. The top half of the slice is pumpkin cheesecake and bottom half is a pecan pie. It's a great combination of two wonderful desserts. The cheesecake was good, and they're definitely on point with the pumpkin flavor. It had just the right amount of spice, and the texture of the cheesecake is always pretty good at the Cheescake Factory. The crunch and sweetness of the pecan pie part really complements the pumpkin cheesecake, and I enjoyed my cheesecake. My only complaint would be that the price of $8 for a cheesecake slice is pretty high, but you are getting quality. For me, I like their cheesecake, but I just don't think it's worth the price for me."
Tanya F.,"Lake St. Louis, MO",1,6,,2.0,8/5/2017,"I called at 3pm on Friday (yesterday) to order an appetizer for takeout... was transferred to the bakery, placed in hold, then a woman picked up, asking if I was the one who had the problem with the cake.  I said no...was placed on hold again....for over 20 minutes... until I was hung up on.  By then I had actually arrived at the restaurant ( after being on hold for 10 minutes) and got in line to order.  The two employees in the bakery were obviously swamped, so after a few minutes I went to the hostess (who had no current customers).  I asked her if there was somewhere else I could order....""No, you can only order carry out in the bakery"".  So I asked her if someone could help the bakery.... I got a strange look... and after a pause she said she could call the manager to help. ( I never saw the manager come over).  Finally someone at the bakery took my order around 3:25, (no apology, no eye contact, no smile) and I waited almost 25 additional minutes to get my food.   The food was good ( buffalo blasts) but the service on this visit was horrible."
Jason M.,"Winterville, NC",10,8,,2.0,1/15/2017,I have been to several Cheesecake Factory's and this one is by far the worst.  We were told no wait for a table... 15mins later we were finally seated.  Silverware was dirty at the table.  Server was friendly but inattentive.  Food came out wrong.  It would have been 1 star but the bread they served was excellent.
Roger W.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,4,2,5.0,2/17/2017,"I went to the Chessecake Factory at 4325 Glenwood Avenue ,on 2\16/2017,and had one of the worst experiences, that I have in a long time . I was standing in line with 4 other Black women, waiting to be served by,the cashier/employee Juan,and he was ignoring us,and refusing to serve us,and then a white woman walked into the Chessecake Factory, from off of the street,and walked to the front of the line and,this Chessecake Factory employee, stopped everything that he was doing, and ran to help ,this white woman, and then he only ,took my order, along with the other Black people 's order, after one of the Black women, said something to this Chessecake Factory employee.  This is the third,time that I have a rasist experience at this Chessecake Factory.  I  am thinking about filing legal action,against this Chessecake Factory.  I think that this Chessecake Factory employee, should be Fired, because of his actions, which is making Chessecake Factory, look bad."
Georgianna J.,"Raleigh, NC",66,36,13,2.0,10/24/2016,Ordered my go to favorite - garlic herb roasted chicken. It was AWFUL!!  The carrots were cold and overcooked. The entire plate was saturated with sauce instead of 'extra on the side.'  Will try again but need to find a new dish!!!
Sarah K.,"Garner, NC",0,31,2,5.0,6/29/2017,"We went during the day around 2:30 and were seated right away. We asked for a booth and the hostess was more then willing to grant our request. Our server was very friendly. The bread was still in the oven when we were seated but we ordered our drinks and chicken nachos. They were absolutely delicious! The waitress came out to let us know the bread was there if we wanted it but we opted to go without this time as we had an app. I kept it simple with the turkey club which was so good and fresh. It was a huge portion. I was able to eat and one and a half pieces and saved the rest. My husband got the Shepards pies which he loved. We ordered two kids meals which were both approved by our kids. All in all we paid about 80 dollars for 4 drinks, an appetizer, two kids meals, two adult meals (huge portions), and two slices of cheesecake. We felt it was money well spent. We will definitely be back to this location."
