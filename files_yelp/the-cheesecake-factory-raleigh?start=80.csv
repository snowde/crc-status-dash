Elisa W.,"St. Louis, MO",0,1,,2.0,1/20/2017,Super dude . There employees don't now how to tell people where the line is for pick up . There's people just standing around. Lots of people want to talk to the manager smh .... Never again
Leslie K.,"Raleigh, NC",1,4,3,5.0,7/20/2016,"Went in with a friend a week ago for lunch. We had a short dark haired waitress named Kelly. She was amazing. Had awesome recommendations, great attitude, was fun, and efficient.  I frequent there for drinks after work and it's always great.  But this experience ranks high on my list of service all over! Good hire Cheesecake!"
Lissy K.,"Lynchburg, VA",9,26,14,2.0,4/8/2015,"My first time at Cheesecake Factory. I had the Wild Blueberry White Chocolate Cheesecake. It was OK. Definitely not worth the prices they are charging. I make better desserts at home.  I ordered the Pineapple Upside Cake Cheesecake originally, but later was told they were out of that one. Maybe that one would've been better....... Mostly it seems you pay for their rental space at the mall. It is enormous and decorated very fancy. Probably won't be back for a very long time. Not really impressed. I will someday give it another chance if I'm with someone who wants to go there. I never give up on a place based on one visit alone, but I am not racing back for mediocre dessert at sky high prices!"
Crystal C.,"Cary, NC",0,41,1,2.0,8/21/2016,"Ordered take-out to take back to work with me. I ordered the turkey sandwich with only cheese and lettuce. Get back to work at they had literally only put cheese and lettuce on my sandwich. No meat at all. I called the manager and told her I didn't have time to go back there and pick up another meal. She offered to have a gift card mailed to me. I told her that was fine. It has been two months, still no card. I am so disappointed in this establishment."
Brie B.,"Raleigh, NC",27,117,137,1.0,3/11/2015,I am basing my review on my takeout experience and solely on the cheesecake  First off. I called and was told I needed to talk to the bakery. They transferred me to the bakery which then let the phone ring for a few minutes. After no answer I called back and was told I must come in to get my dessert since they do not take orders over the phone. They said I would be in and out. Ok. Cool. Whatever. I go and I'm waiting behind 4 waiters who are ordering cheesecake for their tables. The staff working the bakery seemed unbothered and the waiters were in no particular rush. After waiting 10 minutes and listening to their after work plans someone noticed me and took my order. 5 minutes later I was handed my slice of cheese cake that was sitting in the display window. I paid my $8 and went on my way. I got the red velvet cheesecake. One word ; Yuck  It was so bland with the WORST aftertaste. No creaminess no cheesecake flavor. Just gross chemical flavor. My whipped cream tasted better. Immediately my cheesecake went in the trash and I went to Walmart who's cheese cake was 100 times better. If this is how their signature dish tastes I will pass on the food at TCF.  Thanks for leaving a bad taste in my mouth. Literally.
Anyssa M.,"Myrtle Beach, SC",47,12,,2.0,6/26/2016,"After all the hype surrounding this place I was extremely disappointed.  Stick with the cheesecake. We ate lunch, so I'm not sure how that typically stacks up against their usual dinner menu, but the portions were disappointing and very expensive. The cheesecake was good but our entrees were pretty bland. I believe I could have gotten the same food (aside from the cheesecake) anywhere else at a higher quality and lower price.  I would recommend this place only if you're looking for desert after eating somewhere else."
Xiomara L.,"Pikeville, NC",8,7,13,3.0,9/6/2015,"I love the Cheesecake Factory, after today, I am not sure if the drive is worth the price anymore.  First I will say the food was good. We all enjoyed our dishes. Next the wait time was acceptable, they told us 35-40 min and were seated in about 20-25. There is no call ahead seating.  The service from the sever was not what I would expect.  We left 15% tip and had she been better, would have left her more. She was very bland when taking our order, or coming back to make sure we had what we needed. There were long periods before we saw her again, which was unacceptable. It was as if she was trying to get through the day.   The bathroom was semi clean, there were paper towels all over the floor upon entering the bathroom and be careful walking to the bathroom or out the restaurant because there were a few times I almost slipped from how slippery the floor was.  The hostess were very nice and courteous,  they had a smile on their face."
Denise H.,"Garner, NC",0,12,,3.0,6/15/2017,45 min wait in a Tuesday night. Food was mediocre. Was better the next day for lunch. Waiter was excellent.
Mike R.,"Raleigh, NC",37,50,58,4.0,2/28/2016,"Lindsey our waitress was great Kale Quinoa Salad, French Toast claimed to be the best, omelette,  hostess not good, we told the manager and she listened, will be glad to change this to 5 stars next time. ,"
Erik R.,"Apex, NC",17,10,2,4.0,10/16/2016,This place is underrated IMO and the diverse menu is great for satisfying multiple taste buds. We typically come here for birthday dinners because the food is always above average and awesome cheesecakes. Be aware that THEY DO NOT ACCEPT RESERVATIONS so plan ahead.
Luke S.,"Binghamton, NY",20,91,94,5.0,3/19/2016,"This chain always impresses me.  The atmosphere and service are so consistent across each location.   The decor has a higher end feel and the pricing is in the higher side, but it is worth it.   The food...is GREAT.  Everything.  I have not had a meal I thought was just OK.  Lots of choices and items you normally wouldn't find on other menus.   This location is connected to the mall so you can shop then eat or eat then shop.   The cheesecake is Great.  My kids, wife and I love it.  Best you will have and all the flavor safe unique.  It is pricey but portions are plentiful.  You can easily split 1 piece of cheesecake."
Jamie B.,"Fayetteville, NC",39,9,,5.0,11/5/2016,"Cheesecake Factorys are always amazing and this one was no exception, of course the hour wait to be seated is well worth it...our waiter was wonderful and so was our food!! Love love love, would definitely be back."
Michelle B.,"Charlotte, NC",198,632,618,5.0,12/28/2014,"I enjoyed my visit to the restaurant.  Two of us arrived just before the standard dinner hour and were able to be seated within approx. 15 minutes. Our server was fabulous and efficient!  I was pleasantly surprised by the new (for me) skinnylicious menu items.  After all, I had not visited this chain because of the overly large servings of food that encourage you to needlessly stuff your face.  I enjoyed the skinnylicious salmon with asparagus and carrots.  The meal arrived fairly quickly and was delicious!  These menu options are an acceptable size for a normal serving.  This is preferred esp. when away from home and you cannot store leftovers. The price was right, dinner was great, and I left very pleased. I couldn't resist the key-lime pie cheesecake for dessert but you didn't hear that from me!"
Kristin L.,"Newport, RI",0,26,3,1.0,6/19/2016,"Hmmmm, crowded, rude service, expensive, way over cooked vegetables(served with the stems), slippery sticky floor, and a loud environment. Explain to me why SO many flock here? It must be the cheesecake but after my experience here today I will not wait to find out, nor will a return.."
Brittany G.,"Raleigh, NC",176,350,227,3.0,2/21/2015,"Everything is huge here. Even the salads are gigantic mountains of lettuce and toppings. That being said, if you like large portions then you'll really enjoy The Cheesecake Factory. If you favor quality over quantity then it's a bit more hit or miss. Some items, even though they're huge, are actually very good. As bad as they are for me (think 2000+ calories for an entree size!), I really do enjoy the pasta dishes here. But that being said the majority of the dishes on the insanely huge menu are just kinda 'meh'. Lots of frozen and overly processed items with only a handful of standout dishes on a menu that has to be 100+ strong....Seriously. The menu is a book here...Like 15 pages or more. It's kinda overkill.  A couple pros: The design of the Crabtree location is pretty cool. It reminds me of being on a cruise ship or a casino. Also the free bread is pretty good. They give you lots (maaan how many calories have I consumed so far??) and it's often warm. Finally for as insanely busy as this place is the service is very good! Drinks stay filled and the wait staff is incredibly knowledgeable about a seemingly impossible to memorize menu. Kudos! Ironically I have never tried the cheesecake from here, but i've heard good things about it..I'd be more inclined to come in here for dessert and skip dinner all together next time!"
Matt G.,"Morrisville, NC",36,630,,4.0,11/6/2015,"Decided to cut to the chase and go straight for the cheesecake - obviously! It was a nice sunny day, so decided to sit outside, not the best view by the parking lot, but was OK. The cheesecake and key lime pie was delicious. Had some wine also. Altogether did not feel too pricy. Service was fast. Looking forward to going back."
Juanita B.,"Wahiawa, HI",18,27,44,4.0,11/16/2015,I love this place but my guy love it even more ok I had the Thai Glazed Salmon and let me be the 1st to tell you it was absolutely delicious. It was light and tasty so much that I will be returning for lunch tomorrow !!!
Beth S.,"Raleigh, NC",25,9,19,3.0,3/4/2016,Waied 5 minutes for service then felt like the server did not care about me as a customer.
Josh B.,"Durham, NC",7,8,2,1.0,9/20/2015,"The food was great with an establishment that should be able to reproduce exactly the same between all restaurants. The service here was deplorable!  Sat down beside another couple and it seemed apparent that the server knew this couple.  We were a second rate customer in comparison.  For example, we ordered drinks at the same time and the neighboring table received theirs and ours were forgotten and brought with our meal."
April K.,"Creedmoor, NC",54,66,35,3.0,1/3/2016,"Went today with a girlfriend.  I had avocado egg rolls to start.  AH-MAZING!   My entree was the skinny tomato basil flatbread. AH-MAZING! I had salted caramel cheesecake for dessert.  AH-MAZING!  The only issue today was the service.   Stupid slow service.  We never got water refills, and everything took so long to get. Even paying the check took forever. Omg it was painfully slow.  Our server was very nice, but not attentive.  There were tons of wait staff working and I had to send back a dirty bread plate, so I'm not sure how stud is really getting done?  We asked for to go boxes that had to be asked for again because the first person didn't bring them.  Obviously some corners are being cut.  But thank God my food was delicious as hell."
