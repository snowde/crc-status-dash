Rubi D.,"San Jose, CA",39,79,59,5.0,1/5/2018,Really loved this location  Pot stickers r always a good starter.  I also fell in love with the chicken Marsala with a sweet wine sauce and plentiful noodles and heavy chicken.  Had to kill some time so we stayed awhile. Bartenders didn't make us feel rushed.  Great service from Aaron!!!
Jessica R.,"Perris, CA",1,4,3,1.0,12/31/2017,"We have gone to this location at least once a month and I have to say never had Bad Service or Bad Food . Presentation is always perfect . Last night daughter had a large hair on top of her Salmon as it was put in front of her . She  Pointed it out to the waitress and was told she would get another however waitress left the disgusting plate in front of my daughter and came back in over 5 mins to pick it up  ? Waitress promised to get another plate on the fly . 2nd plate came at a regular time as I slowly finished mine waiting for her to be served . When check cAme was told by Waitress  that she charged us for 3 and took off the extra one .  I was disappointed there was no discount or offer to make it right and yet to point out you charged us for 3 and took off one ?? How generous not to charge us for the 3rd one . We gave our card to pay And decided when waitress cAme back that this just seem right . So asked her if Manager could  come over he didn't come till over 5 mins and his name was ""John"" he was very condescending and it was brought to his attn about what happened . He explained about the 3rd charge of the salmon was for them to monitor their inventory. He offered free cheesecake my daughter  stated no thank you I don't like cheesecake . Your cheesecake is 6.00 my salmon was 19.99 how does that compare  John said well we already charged your card there is nothing I can do . Really John that's your response ? We left with the same bill at the same price . I am extremely Sad and disappointed . Hoping that someone with much more Power than John reads this and determines this wasn't handled appropriately . With many years of experience of eating in restaurants this was handled poorly from the start . Mistakes happen and we can overlook the hair , but to leave the plate and wait for them to remove it Yuck!!!! Management should have approached us during the meal to apologize not to have to request one with a snotty attitude as if it was our fault .  I would be lying if I say I'll never go back As I love their food . Perhaps it won't be at that location."
Nick J.,"Chino, CA",6,69,2,4.0,12/15/2017,"Went here to eat dinner and to take advantage of their half-off cheesecake prices. The dinner was outstanding, the service was outstanding, and of course the cheesecake was outstanding! This particular location is always crowded but they do provide a call to you once your table is ready so you can walk around Victoria Gardens while you wait for your table. ***Update*** Came here tonight to pickup some cheesecake to go. I ordered ahead. When I got there I had to wait in line behind an employee who was joking around with the employee who was supposed to be preparing my cheesecake. I had to say something to interrupt because they didn't notice me there otherwise who knows how long I would've been standing there and waiting... was not very impressed with customer service tonight."
Darien C.,"Los Angeles, CA",3012,223,141,4.0,12/3/2017,Service has definitely improved here! Visited a few times and I only dine in the bar area now. The waiters are much more attentive and friendly here and the speed of receiving drinks and food is much quicker than dining in the other areas of the restaurant! I came here this past Friday night for dessert and not surprising - they were busy. We did end up putting our name in with the host but kept our eye on the bar area since that is the only place I really like sitting at now. It took maybe 15 minutes but we did grab a table from another couple that were leaving.  A bus boy came right away to clear the previous guests dishes and wipe down the table. A few minutes after we sat down a waiter came by to let us know he would be back to take our drink order. Even though the bar area was full he was pretty attentive during our visit. Kevin P was the one who served us during our visit and he was great! He would stop by to check on us but not intrude too often.  I ordered the Chocolate hazelnut crunch cheesecake which is basically a Nutella cheesecake. It is super sweet! As are all of their cheesecake options but this one was covered in a thick layer of Nutella on the top that made me feel like a sugar rush would stay in my system for weeks to come! Definitely need a large glass of water to go with any of their desserts because the sweetness will overwhelm you after a few bites.  It's so sweet I even wondered if it is better to share one of their slices of sugar heaven. And sharing food isn't one of my favorite things to do! The desserts are cut big enough to share with someone if you've already eaten an entree too so keep that in mind.  Overall I am upping my previous rating to 4 stars because of them improving! I have yet to eat in their main dining area but I am content with the bar area because I have received good service there. Will continue to come here mainly for dessert! Good on them for being able to convince me that they deserve better a better rating and more visits to come!!
Alan P.,"Chino Hills, CA",616,214,217,4.0,11/6/2017,"Came here to have a lunch meeting with a few of my clients. I've actually never really eaten here at Cheesecake Factory, only really came for drinks and desserts. I was extremely hungry and I was in the mood for some salmon! I ended up going with The miso salmon.  As far as appearance goes, the dish came out and was ok. Didn't look too appetizing as far as the other dishes that came out.  But! Wow, I wasn't expecting the amount of flavor! I think I have found my new favorite salmon dish in the area! The salmon is well prepared and layed on a bed of rice. (They have white or brown rice option) then on top. On the bottom is delightful miso sauce, which definitely tied the whole dish together."
Dawn S.,"San Francisco, CA",143,82,88,1.0,1/7/2018,"The definition of bad service. Came here at 4:30Pm to grab a table, they do not take reservations. Waited an hour. Sat down for ten mins. The waiter that was supposed to serve us, looked at us and walked away didn't even say hi or serve us water. I had to flag another waiter down and tell him the situation. I don't get why he was serving the tables surrounding us makes eye contact then ignores us. Food was good, portions are huge. People next to us were huge too, so i guess it blends in. Poor chair, looked like it was about to break. Definitely should have ordered one plate per four people. Loved the 1,300 calorie cheesecake. delicious. Bought an entire cheesecake to bring home. Ghetto wide chicks in the bathroom taking selfies and holding up the line when there's two empty stalls. If you cut them because they expect you to wait for their selfie time to finish....they yell ""THERE'S A LINE."" ""DAMN JOCELYN, you a thug."" Inland Empire, what can I say?"
Anthony D.,"Anaheim, CA",30,583,317,4.0,12/28/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory serves great ""average"" food made with quality ingredients. The prices are good, and the service here is always friendly. If you run into any issue with your meal, the managers are always ready to make it right."
Colleen E.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",15,22,10,2.0,1/10/2018,I tried Cheesecake Factory back when they opened and was not really impressed. I have heard all these great comments about it the last few years so I decided to try it again last night.  Well my friend and I ordered the California Cheesesteak sandwich based on the picture on the internet and description listed. I also ordered the spicy tortilla soup. The soup was totally tasteless and not spicy. The sandwiches did not look like the internet. The bell peppers were extremely hard to find. The cheese tasted like velveta and I hate that taste. The coffee had grounds at the bottom of the cup. The waitress acted like a chicken with her head cut off. Needless to say I will not be going back anytime soon
Reyna G.,"Rialto, CA",0,6,2,3.0,1/10/2018,I like the chicken Alfredo delicious but they take too long to get your order omg the blended Georgia peach alcohol drink is s o good. I always ask for more brown dark bread but they never bring it  they bring me more white bread I tell them and they say they will take a while to cook it and they always get my order wrong but I like some food there the cheese cake good but not as good as the Costco one . Oh Fried macaroni and cheese  balls really good and the Caesar said really good with the Caesar or ranch on the side cause they add to much dressing.
Peter C.,"Walnut, CA",65,76,18,3.0,1/6/2018,"We were seated not too long after we signed in the front. The table was a little wobbly but the associate fixed it right up. The waiter was nice but the food came really slow and she was also slow on refilling the bread and didn't refill our water when it was almost gone. The food prices were slightly high for pasta and tacos so we just went with the NY steaks since it was a few dollars more than the pastas and tacos. The steaks were good, I had mine medium rare and my wife complain to me her medium was more of a medium well. Anyhow we had a cheesecake for desert which was good. The to-go cheese seem a smaller size compared to eating at Cheesecake."
Rachel B.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,3,31,3.0,11/27/2017,"We usually avoid coming here, as there is always a long wait time. Surprisingly, however, when we went on Sunday for dinner after church, we only had to wait for less than ten minutes! What was on the table? Chicken Madeira, Lemon Herb Chicken, Calamari, Pear/Arugula/Bleu Cheese Flatbread, and Kids' Roadside Sliders.  My husband loved the Chicken Madeira. The chicken was moist and tender, and the sauce was very flavorful. The Lemon Herb Chicken on the other hand was overly tangy. My daughter  has had a similar dish from other restaurants, and the previous ones she had had just a hint of lemon, not overpowering. I was pleased with the calamari, although I have had better dishes. I truly enjoyed the pear, arugula, and bleu cheese flatbread. It was light, but filling enough. Loved the combination of pecans and pears. My son was satisfied with his sliders.  To top of our dinner, we ordered a slice of Mango Key Lime Cheesecake to share. I would have preferred fresh mango slices on top instead of mango jelly/gelatin; it tasted artificial to me. My boys enjoyed it, though.  All in all, the dining experience was pleasant enough. The service was excellent, while some of the foods admittedly could've been better."
Kathy T.,"Irvine, CA",320,246,582,2.0,6/19/2017,"I'm still trying to understand the appeal of Cheesecake Factory -- every location I've been to has been mediocre at best. My only conclusion is that people like to see big portions of food on over-sized plates. The only reason I'm giving this place a 2 instead of a 1 star rating is because the service was good. We sat at the bar for a bit and the bartender was very friendly. We had a large group, so I appreciate that our waiter was also really attentive and patient. They have good bread (sourdough and wheat) that came out warm. The rest of the food was not the best though... - Eggplant Parmesan - Eggplant was a little on the thin/flimsy side and a few bites were bitter (tells me the eggplant may not be fresh). The pesto pasta was decent. - Jambalaya - My friends said it was bland. Not very good or flavorful. In my opinion, I'd much rather go to another restaurant with relatively the same prices and pay for quality over quantity."
Victoria H.,"Riverside, CA",0,13,2,1.0,12/26/2017,"I came here with three friends. We ordered only desserts. I love the Cheesecake Factory, so I was excited. However, it took them way to long to take our order. After we ate, it took over an hour for us to get our check. And after we got our check, it took a good 20 minutes for the card to come back. The restaurant was empty. What was taking so long? We got here at 8:30 and are currently leaving at 10:45!! Very irritating.  When we tried to get attention from waitresses, they would ignore us. Never coming back to this location again."
Hassan N.,"Chino Hills, CA",131,9,5,4.0,12/22/2017,"Ate at this place a few weeks ago after walking around the Victoria Gardens shopping area in Rancho CA. They usually have long lines and take around 30-40 mins on average to seat a party of 5. Food was definitely worth the wait though. I ordered the chipotle pasta with chicken and my friends ordered the shrimp jambalaya pasta and monster wet burrito. We also ordered the factory nachos as an appetizer to share. Every thing was extremely tasty and was served in very large portions. Only down side would have to be the price, as the average entre was around $19-$25. Will definitely be visiting again!"
Gloria M.,"Montclair, CA",83,91,90,4.0,12/29/2017,"This is my favorite restaurant because honestly you can't go wrong with cheesecake. I usually come to this location and it can get pretty busy. On weekends you will wait at least 30+ minutes. I highly recommend the corn cakes as an appetizer to share. I also recommend their famous chicken Madeira dish. It's chicken breast, in a delicious wine sauce, topped with cheese, mushrooms, and asparagus. It is served with mashed potatoes. Lastly, if you are a chocolate lover the Oreo cheesecake is the best. I also love the fresh banana cheesecake. I gave this place 4 stars and honestly I was leaning toward 3, but it is my favorite place to eat. The reason I am giving it 4 stars is because the chairs (not booths) are very uncomfortable especially if you are a thicker person. Also my utensils were not that clean the last time I went. Overall I do recommend this place!! I hope they get more comfortable chairs."
J W.,"San Bernardino, CA",2,98,59,3.0,1/10/2018,"I'm a little disappointed.. I ordered chicken quesadilla for appetizer, and extra bread  however, it took so long that it came with my main entree. I asked if they would take it back because at that point everyone's food was there. I'm guessing because the place was extra packed. But I can attest that I usually have better service. I can't say I won't return but if I see it that busy I'll just come at a less busy time."
Terance S.,"San Diego, CA",0,7,5,2.0,12/17/2017,"First off I love eating at The Cheesecake Factory. I've been to numerous locations and never came across a situation like this. My girlfriend and I walked up to the front desk and waited there for 5 minutes without anyone greeting us or even acknowledging that we were there. As soon as we got called up to get seated they told us that we were going to be sitting outside without initially asking us. Mind you it's freezing and windy outside but we were also starving so we agreed to sit outside. We got to our table and it's uneven.. it rocks back and forth making it uncomfortable to even rest your elbows on the edge, there's no complimentary wheat bread available, it took a while for a server to ask us what we wanted to drink, and the employees here are just awfully rude. Overall food was good but bad service."
Caitie G.,"Costa Mesa, CA",128,2,2,1.0,12/15/2017,I understand it's the lunch rush but seriously how about some quality control here. Every time we order from this location something is either burnt or not packaged correctly.
Monique A.,"Pittsburg, TX",930,324,1175,4.0,2/14/2017,"We arrived at 530pm and only had to wait 10 minutes since we took first available. They sat us outside which was a little chilly but we had a heat lamp right next to us and had them turn it on low. It was perfect! My husband ordered the ribeye with mash potatoes and green beans with a side Caesar salad. I ordered their Asian wrap tacos and I will say it was the best wrap by far I have tasted. It was the two sauces they gave me for my tacos that made the difference. It was perfect and very filling. My husband said his ribeye was good but he was actually impressed with the green beans. Order came quick that everything came out at once so he had to eat salad along with his dinner.  We also ordered cocktails and I decided to order the skinny Margarita and was actually surprised on how tasty it was. I have ordered skinny drinks before and didn't like them so was very happy that this one was so good. Service was good, our sever was pleasant and attentive. We decided going out on 2/13 verse 2/14 would provide a much better dinner experience.  We were so full that we skipped dessert which was the whole reason I went with a low carb low calorie meal."
Ron V.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",95,126,273,4.0,10/23/2017,"The food at Cheesecake Factory has always been good, but it's not above average. At a higher price then the average it should be a lot better. The service is good and friendly. The atmosphere is great and with nice outdoor seating area to enjoy with friends."
Michelle G.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",201,165,973,3.0,3/19/2017,"I had lunch with my Sista here and it was packed! There were people waiting outside, people waiting inside, and I was ready to walk out of the restaurant but we spotted 2 empty seats at the bar and snagged them. I Food: I ordered the chicken samosas from the appetizer/light portion menu. I wasn't expecting much since Cheesecake Factory isn't known for authentic Indian cuisine, but I have to admit the flavor of the samosas with the dipping sauce was delicious! The only negative comment about my dish is that it was a little bit greasy. Service: Our server was friendly and knowledgeable about our menu questions. She checked on us occasionally without being bothersome. Ambiance: This afternoon it was very busy and very loud in the restaurant. I would have preferred a quieter area, but we took the only seats that were available without a wait. In fact, when we got up out of our seats, there was a couple waiting to take our spots! Would I return? Yes, perhaps on a less busy day and time."
Joseph S.,"Fontana, CA",4,3,,1.0,12/26/2017,Worst service ever!  Do not waste your time or money on this place.  Is it possible to give a negative star rating??
Jackie O.,"West Covina, CA",283,243,1072,4.0,1/17/2017,"Not always my first choice for dinner but I was pleasantly surprised and besides the long wait, my party had a good time. Sunday night at 8pm, we had about a 30min wait. Upon seating, we got complimentary bread, Honey oat wheat and sourdough. It was warm and yummy. Plus we were starving after a day of snowboarding.  As for appetizers, we got the deep fried avocado, portobello, and zucchini ""fries"". It was about $6.95 for a good amount, not too filling and probably about 3-4 pieces each. Comes with two dipping sauces as well.  As for entrees, for a party of three, we ordered Chicken Bellagio, Herb Crusted Salmon, and the Eggplant Parmesan. All good, favorite was the Herb Crusted Salmon though. The Chicken Bellagio was good but they ran out of arugula so the prosciutto was out of place. In all actuality, by the time we got our entree, we were pretty full from the bread and appetizer.  For 1 appetizer, 3 entrees, a beer, and an arnold palmer, total was $93 without tip. Also to add on, our waitress was on point. She was really attentive and made herself available to us."
Tony M.,"Ontario, CA",0,4,2,1.0,12/31/2017,Waited 1hour 45 mons for food when told our food would be ready in 30 to 45 mins never recieved food workers forgot about us on curbside waited in the car. To be told it would be longer after we paid then was told when we canceled order that they would have to mail gift cards because they didnt have ours anymore... We left with two kids with no food no compensation and had to fight to get my gift card back ... Manager was rude didnt hear me out tried to get me to have my giftcards mailed to me it was ridiculous ..worst location ever ruined our whole night traveled 20 mins and never got any food or any compensation honestly this exp. Ruined everything .... I no longer will come to this place with the way things are ran its crazy and the worst exp. Ever!!!
Sean T.,"Carlsbad, CA",0,8,,5.0,1/2/2018,"Cheesecake Factory in Carlsbad is a wonderful place.  Not only are their deserts out of this world so is their Gumbo.  My girlfriend had the Gumbo and told me it was her favorite meal she's ever eaten!!  My dinner was very good too.  I ordered the chicken enchiladas.  After dinner we each enjoyed a slice of cheesecake.  We ordered the Oreo and Mango Key lime. Both were good but since that day I've stopped back by to get a couple more slices of the Oreo cheesecake, where as I would normally get a piece of Linda's Fudge Cake about once a month from the Escondido Cheesecake Factory.   Needless to say we are very much looking forward to returning again soon!"
Gisselle E.,"Temple City, CA",158,54,52,1.0,7/2/2017,"First time going to a Cheesecake Factory, and having just a horrible experience. First time coming here to this location, and probably the last time.                To begin we check in and the lady asked if we want an indoor or outdoor seating, and she did say if we sit outside there is a lot of shade and fans outside therefore we said okay. Once we get called to go to our table, we get a table that was outside and barely had some shade and the table was burning hot the minute you touched it. And there was no fans so we weren't happy, but we didn't complain or anything. They had us wait longer for another table.                 Finally we get buzzed again to say that our table was ready, we get seated and notice that the table wasn't even cleaned right. The table was all sticky, and the utensils that were supposedly ""cleaned"" were all dirty with a piece of lettuce on it. By then I was completely grossed out and didn't want to eat there anymore."
Stephanie G.,"Anaheim, CA",0,140,145,4.0,12/27/2016,"Chasity delivered outstanding service. She is very detailed and attentive. The food is good and so is dessert. (Mash potatoes are too buttery but that's just personal preference). Thanks for a very pleasant experience, Chasity! So I've visited several times now and have moved on to the Pasta Da Vinci. It's a penne pasta with caramelized onions and mushrooms accompanied by chicken. I crave this all the time now. Like usual, service is great once you get passed the rude/snobby hostesses."
Bill R.,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",63,217,1726,4.0,7/14/2017,Friendly staff at the bar. Very attentive and quick. I agree with others the price of cocktails are absurd here.  But I came for lunch and the ice tea gets free refills.  Tortilla soup. Excellent. Full of flavor and fresh vegetables.  Lunch special chicken piccata. Really good. Always one of my favorites however this time they forget the capers--the quintessential ingredient in a piccata. It was a good dish Nonetheless.  This place seems to get hammered with poor reviews due to being crowded and long wait times. This is pretty much the case for every Cheesecake Factory I've ever been to for dinner. I suppose that's why I chose to come for lunch.
Lynn N.,"Huntington Beach, CA",629,202,287,4.0,12/24/2016,"We came here for dinner on Christmas Eve. There was a long wait (45mins) for inside seatings so we chose the patio. They were efficient in seating us right away and gave us a table by the heating lamp as requested. The lamp kept us warm on a very cold night. Inside was stuffy and crowded. I was glad that I was outside.  Our server was very polite and attentive. The food came out pretty quick for such a busy night. I got steak medallion with shiitake mushrooms, potatoes, and asparagus. The beef was cooked to medium and well seasoned. The fried calamari was crispy. The Santa Fe salad was okay."
Cathy S.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",3,1,,1.0,12/29/2017,"Sat in the bar area and waited 15 minutes with no server. I finally had to go to the front and ask for our server and 5minutes later she shows up , no apology just rushed us to take our order and walks away.  So rude!"
Miles E.,"Corona, CA",44,23,,4.0,11/10/2017,"Cheesecake Factory has such delicious food.  I usually go with chicken marsala, gumbo or the pit beef sandwich.  Unfortunately, they got rid of the pit beef.  Why? Disappointing. Anyway, I had the gumbo which was great and the s'mores cheesecake.  Also great."
Randolph K.,"Chino, CA",57,105,90,1.0,6/20/2017,"Food: ""Eek! Methinks not."" (1/5) Cheesecake: ""Yay-ok"" (3.5/5) 4th time visiting a Cheesecake factory and I've regretted it each time. I've even regretted coming the last time when my whole meal was comp'ed. How this restaurant chain remains busy and in expansion befuddles me. It's mid-range pricing at approx $16 for a dish, and that's where the good news stops. Wait, I take that back, the complimentary bread was enjoyable and the service is usually good. The end. I've probably tried 6 or 7 dishes now including appetizers and dessert. It's been regrettable every time. I'd pay not to eat here again. This time around I had the jambalaya pasta and both the chicken and shrimp were mushy and bland (old, frozen and thawed). I was scared I might get an upset stomach from the shrimp because it was such an odd mushy texture. The linguine pasta was bland. Does anyone taste test the food before it comes out? Not a single dish I've had here, or any other location, was enjoyable.  The variety of menu options is horrific. Pretty sure they've got a wider selection of food than a Las Vegas buffet. I'd recommend going somewhere else."
Jan D.,"Buena Park, CA",844,843,16,4.0,6/1/2017,"Service here is always good. The food is good, the ambiance is good, the location was great.. Everything was good here.  Always so much to choose from in the menu and everything always delivers! My faves are: the cashew chicken and rice, the hamburgers are all great, cheesecakes of all sorts of course, pretty much all the appetizers, and pastas! LOL! I guess I named them all! The only thing I would steer away from is the veggie burger and the salads!"
Tadesse T.,"College Station, TX",34,94,1390,5.0,11/16/2017,Wow! Cakes! This is a specialized cakes and sweets factory. I loved my Celebration Cake slice and enjoyed it. It was so colourful and flavourful choice.
Keegan P.,"Pomona, CA",0,30,2,5.0,11/3/2017,"I won a gift card to Cheesecake Factory, and I've never been to one. I almost didn't want to go, due to the low rating, but we were getting only pre-movie drinks and an appetizer, so you know, $25 off, why not? We sat in the bar for prompt service. The bartender was a master of her craft. I got a perfect mojito, and my husband got a perfect margarita.  We ordered the Calamari, because we love calamari, and that's what we order when we are in celebratory mood (I had won a costume contest, after all) and I have to say it is definitely in the top 3 calamari experiences of my entire life.  The outside was crispy, but not too crunchy. The inside was DOWNRIGHT BUTTERY! Not the slightest bit rubbery whatsoever. There were both the rings, and the intact tiny squids we all know and love. I generally avoid the red cocktail sauce in favor of the white sauce, but at the urging of my husband, I was pleasantly surprised and I can say without a doubt that that is The Best cocktail sauce (the red dipping sauce if that's what it's called) I have ever had. It was tart, with just the whisper of a spicy kick.  The portion was so generous, we had trouble finishing it between the two of us. It's probably, seriously 13 years since I've had its equal. Huzzah!"
Michele W.,"Ontario, CA",6,15,,2.0,10/21/2017,"I came in early Friday evening around 5 pm. The place was starting to get busy. I was meeting a friend later to see a movie and shop so I sat at the bar and ordered a glass of wine a Greek salad and the Fried Mac n Cheese. Salad came out loaded with tomatoes and maybe 4 Kalamata olives, cut in long quarters. It was decent. The Fried Mac n Cheese came and it was so bland. I've had it before and it was good but certainly not this time.  The thing is, everyone else at the bar was offered bread - not me. Everyone was offered a to go box - not me. 3 bartenders and a barback and not one would make eye contact with me. I called out several times for salt and pepper, a refill on my diet coke and another glass of wine. 3 bartenders running back and forth like a chicken with its head cut off is not necessary even during early dinner service, understanding it is an extensive menu but it looked unprofessional and it made me uncomfortable to ask for anything."
Rosita r.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",71,39,87,5.0,10/24/2017,"Hibachi steak with shiitake mushrooms, onions bean sprouts, wasabi mashed potatoes and grilled onions!"
Dana S.,"Orange, CA",43,3,,2.0,11/12/2017,The service was excellent.. But the food had no taste salmon with herbs yuck diane steak no seasoning My son loves pizza and i ordered for him he didnt eat it
Anne M.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",56,36,3,3.0,9/19/2017,"I swear, restaurants these days all have a mandatory wait, even when over half the restaurant has open seating.  What's the purpose?  Is it a formality that makes them feel important.   Are they trying to come across like a doctor' office (we'll seat you on our terms because your in my house). Back in the day when I was a server the rule was ""ALL tables must be full before you make any GUEST wait.""   I think I'm going to have to find a restaurant that has that motto."
Katrina R.,"Yucaipa, CA",0,5,,4.0,1/7/2018,"The food was so good, even though we waited almost an hour for a table we will still go back. Weekends are busy, next time will definitely go back during the week. Our waiter was fantastic. The only bad thing i have to say is that they're unorganized when it comes to having guests wait. They were paging people and then having groups of people wait in a main walking area for servers."
