Berlin M.,"Garden Grove, CA",124,47,38,1.0,11/19/2016,"Worst service I've ever received at any Cheesecake Factory. Had to ask multiple times for napkins and boxes to go and ranch and the bread. The bread that ALWAYS comes out first. I got the bread after all the appetizers because ""she had to put in our order first"" before we could get it. I've never had to go through that. Our waitress was the worst. If it wasn't for my party having to leave abruptly I would've had to ask the manager to switch our waitress. We would ask her for what we wanted and she would disappear for ten minutes at a time. When we would see her again we would have to remind her for what she had forgotten. And on top of that we had to go up to a different waitress when one of our party had an accident and yacked on the table because of course, our lady could not be found. Other waitress was quick and helped us. Food was good like usual. Katrina I believe was our waitress and she could not have been more unfriendly."
Matthew D.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",26,2,,2.0,2/12/2017,"-3 stars, -3 hours hours of my life I've spent waiting for my damn food and cheesecake. Food is fantastic! Worst service I've ever had... Also, THREE WORDS: BREW MORE COFFEE!!! I did not get a single refill the entire 2 and a half hours I was there"
Willy O.,"Rancho Palos Verdes, CA",12,67,,4.0,1/14/2017,"Went here not long ago with a business partner for lunch. Parking is always a challenge at Victoria Gardens, but I like to park in the parking garage and walk over. Lunch time can get busy here. We had a 10 minute wait because we wanted to sit out on their dining patio.The patio is a great place to people watch also. Waitress took our drink orders and when she came back took our food order. Food came out quickly. My Thai salad was great. Drinks were good and always kept full."
Julie H.,"West Covina, CA",73,80,53,5.0,10/3/2016,"I absolutely love the Cheesecake Factory! In over 20 years of going here, I have never once been disappointed. A must try of their appetizers is their pear & Gorgonzola flat bread or Thai lettuce wraps. Main entree fav is their creamy Farfalle pasta with chicken, roasted garlic, mushrooms, sun dried tomatoes, panchetta & peas topped with freshly grated Parmesan, it's one of their best!!  When it comes to their desserts I rotate between their fresh strawberry shortcake. It's large enough to split three ways with a giant sweet rock sugar coated scone split open & stuffed with a scoop of vanilla ice scream, fresh strawberries & loads of homemade whipped cream. Or Another must try is their cream cheese topped carrot cake cheesecake. Happy just thinking about it...  Or For an intense flavorful choice their key lime mango cheesecake is spectacular. Also their mellow fresh banana cheesecake & lovely red velvet cheesecake are two definite runner ups ;)"
Elbert L.,"Lomita, CA",0,1,,1.0,7/27/2017,"I LOVED Cheesecake factory and never been to this location. Pulled a long blonde hair from my mouth as I was chewing on my Chinese Chicken salad tonight...yuck! I still feel qweezy from thinking of the sensation on my tongue when I discovered the hair. Myself and my entire party except for one guy with short hair, have very dark brown hair.  I completely lost my appetite and watched everyone else eat dinner and dessert.  The server offered another fresh salad but I didn't feel like ordering the same one so asked for a different one. The manager came by to apologize and removed the original salad with the hair off the bill but still charged us for the replacement that I didn't touch from feeling so sick to my stomach. Really?? Dear manager, 'Your customer lost their appetite due to your short comings as a manager. I will definately spread the word never to step foot into your establishment!!' By the looks of other comments, it seems I am not alone.  I should've ready the ratings before entering this restuarant and spending $200. Such a disappointment. I don't feel the need to step foot into a CF anytime soon after this experience. The staff here seemsti be a poor representation of the company."
Adri F.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,2,3,1.0,9/13/2016,The incompetence of management and staff is unreal! The kitchen ran out of mashed potatoes and my family of 6 waited 20 minutes LONGER to receive their food because no one asked me what they could substitute my side of mashed potatoes with... Manager had no sympathy for his staff feeding my family COLD FOOD! Yes! Every dish had cold food! Cold fries! Cheese was hardened after melting! Vegetables were a soggy cold mess! I would never come to this restaurant ever again! This area usually has standards. Clearly this restaurant has no standards for customer service! PATHETIC!
Jacki D.,"Tehachapi, CA",1,3,1,2.0,7/23/2017,"So my mom & daughter & I go to one of my favorite places to eat...I love their variety of food & normally have great service....NOT today!! My daughter has celiacs & checked with our waitress on a dish she wanted. Waitress asked the kitchen about it & said it is ok for her to eat. 30 minutes later a different waiter brings my mom's & my food without my daughter's. The kitchen manager then brings her entree out & asks if she has a real gluten intolerance...which she does that's why she asked so many question about it prior to ordering! They offered her a cobb salad which she said ok to. It took another 20 minutes to get to go, she was able to eat 1/2 her salad before we had received the bill we asked for when we received her food. No time in between did the come by to see how are meal was or if we wanted refills. The bill had her $10 meal taken off & her now $15 dollar salad on the bill. I asked them to remove that charge & I have to say they did with out an argument...thankfully! Needless to say it was disappointing!"
Lyn R.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,12,1,1.0,1/16/2017,"Don't bother going to this place !! Worst customer service ever !! I really wish yelp had a no star option , because they sure as hell don't even deserve one."
Charlene C.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",1498,929,5247,4.0,3/5/2014,"I think Cheesecake Factory for me has always been hit or miss, however I actually don't mind this location. I got a Gift Card for my birthday last year and finally decided to use it.  I've been to the Victoria Gardens Cheesecake Factory 3 times now and the service has always been pretty good.  At this location, I've tried: ======================= Avocado Eggrolls @ $10.95 (4/5) Factory Nachos with chicken @ $12.95 (5/5) Lunch Cobb Salad @ $10.50 (2/5) Lunch Pizza and Salad @ $11.95 (3/5)  Lunch Miso Salmon @ $13.95 (4/5) Fish & Chips @ $16.95 (4/5) Chocolate Tuxedo Cream Cheesecake (5/5) Iced Tea @ $2.95 Raspberry Lemonade @ $4.50 The Factory Nacho appetizers are HUGE and cost the same as a lunch special. Those were so good especially if you add the spicy chicken on it. I ordered a Pepperoni Pizza and my sister-in-law ordered a Hawaiian Pizza and both of us found the pizzas really salty. The lemonades are super sweet and all the cheesecakes are to die for. The last time we were here was on Monday 3/3/14 for my brother-in-laws birthday dinner. Our server did a great job with our party of 8 and even put up with all the boys' (my husband, 2 brother-in-laws and cousin - They can be a handful) We never had an empty glass. They all came out to sing to him and I was so stuffed, I didn't even order a slice of cheesecake. Maybe the strategy next time would be to order dessert first....... 44/100 Reviews for 2014"
Goodgrindz Z.,"Moreno Valley, CA",236,31,,2.0,12/23/2016,We went there a couple nights ago and we're seated in the bar area but it took awhile for us to get water and bread and throughout the entire night the servers kept on bringing food that was not ours. We are not talking once or twice but the entire night. We were brought the wrong food at least 6 times during our one meal. Our server did not seem very attentive.
Robert L.,"Fontana, CA",27,58,154,1.0,2/21/2016,"Choose cheesecake factory for sunday brunch with my wife and daughter today . Quickly seated on the patio .which was great on this great California day .that's where things changed . We place our order and waited about 20 minutes until our order started coming out.  1st my daughters pancake combo ,then maybe 10 minutes later my monte' cristo sandwich. Now 20 mins ..25 mins and my wifes order still not served .the waitress not coming around , whats up ?  Now a manger approaches the table .stating "" you order a green chilaquiles "" we're sorrybut it was served to a different table ,we are currently making you a new order .now another 15 's mins pass and we're told the order was made incorrectly but the new will be out soon .. So much for having breakfast as a family. After eatting off my daughter's plate ,my wifes order was placed which we took to go ...the food that was served was good "" but the guest relations and service where off the scale ..dont know what was happening in the kitchen ..but , it through off our start to the morning .."
James T.,"Ontario, CA",0,15,,1.0,6/3/2017,"If the manager is Israel, you won't be happy.. and he will make sure you aren't happy. We came in with a large party and the service was cool. Bread came out hard and food came out with watery sauce on the pasta, but it was family time so whatever. Cauliflower steak was out so we asked for the Chipotle chicken pasta sub the chicken for veggies and was denied by the manager.. then two kids in our party ordered chocolate milk and both ended up vomiting by the end of dinner. We let our server know that we believed it may have been the milk. She grabbed the manager Israel who proceeded to immediately defend his chocolate milk. ""It's the most popular drink for kids!"" ""I've been serving milk all night and no one inside has been sick!"" We informed him that if he would have come to the table and understood that we were simply attempting to inform him that the chocolate milk could have been an issue and he should check it, then we wouldn't be writing a negative yelp review right now nor would we be calling corporate first thing Monday morning. We've dined at many Cheesecake Factories and this has been the worst manager we've ever encountered. Very unprofessional, and bent on proving a point over exhibiting understanding and customer service. Oh and I can't forget that the vomit was left on the table, chair and ground until after we left.. (at least 40mins) feel bad for the surrounding diners and the people who would sit at that table after us. Poor Management and bad night/experience, it'll be a while before we attend this location if ever again."
Yousef R.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,24,1,4.0,6/18/2017,The food is so so delicious only gave them four stars because the service is not so good honestly I just think it's because they're so busy and I know that they have so much to do but it's just not good service in terms of waiting for your food to actually come out I get full on my bread Bc it takes so long for my meal to come out and this is all the time but I still go back because the food is so goodThe waiters and waitresses are so nice and it's not their fault but they really need to figure out how to bring out food faster
David D.,"Phoenix, AZ",31,4,,1.0,12/14/2016,"After missing the targeted wait time I asked how much longer and the hostess was extremely rude.  The manager was no help and disappeared when I turned away.  There are plenty of options at Victoria Gardens, go elsewhere."
Hugo D.,"Sun City, CA",0,60,47,5.0,6/12/2016,Love this place delicious food and dont forget the chessecake.  Try the chicken and bisquits its amazing and the avocado eggrolls are delicious a must try..
Stars C.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",1,34,2,1.0,6/12/2017,"I love the cheesecake factory, but this is probably the worst location for services. I was here yesterday and we were seated at 7:30. It took over an hour to get our food, which some of it was cold. We kept having to ask the server for drinks as he was rushing by our table. We didn't leave uni 9 and it was not because we were hanging out. We waited over 25 minutes for the server to bring back out cards and change.  I have given this location a chance several times and it the same thing, very very poor service and tons of waiting"
Christina M.,"Desert Hot Springs, CA",0,48,17,3.0,8/19/2016,"This is my 2nd Cheesecake Factory I've been too.. And I'm getting really disappointed with their policies and service overall. We were a party of 15 and I asked our waitress ""do you do anything for graduations?"" She said no.. I'm sorry. But you can purchase a chesecake and we can put a candle on it"" WTH, we brought 15 people to YOUR resteraunt when there was other places we could've chosen and you can't go out of your way to comp a free cheesecake and write congrats on the plate? Is that so hard?... This place is so stingy with their money and won't binge the rules just to make a party of 15 happy... Then she was trying to split the check 3 ways due to ""policy"" seriously? It shouldn't matter how you get the money, as long as you get it.. That's okay, never again."
D R.,"Rosemead, CA",51,31,17,1.0,2/3/2015,"Horrible horrible horrible!!! The last time we were here was over a year ago and the service was not bad then.  Tuesday afternoon, the restaurant is practically empty yet it takes a while to get our food. My wife ordered the Mexican Salad. The cilantro was old and yellow from refrigerator frost. She sent it back and ordered lettuce wraps.  15 minutes later and they were still not out, we cancelled the order all together. The manager comes our with the wraps in hand 5 min later, couldn't convince us.  We noticed that the server noticed a spill on the floor and instead of using paper towels or the rags used by the bus boys, they used a towel used by clients to wipe our mouths or that of our children. I know they get washed or at least we hope they do.  Really horrible experience don't think we'll be coming back."
Jordyn K.,"Upland, CA",0,2,,3.0,6/30/2017,"Order a to-go order was told it would be ready in 20-25 mins, ended up waiting 50 mins for our food, ordered a large to-go strawberry lemonade and was given a small? The girl who helped me was very nice tho. But service was too slow"
Vinnie B.,"Downey, CA",9,198,332,2.0,2/27/2016,"We came here for a birthday celebration it was a Saturday night and very crowded but we got in early enough around 4:45. The food is good I had the pasta with shrimp but most good restaurants remove the annoying shell that you dont expect, how hard is it to remove chefs? Then because we had a large party of 8 and a birthday they came out with a birthday sunday in a shot glass, hahahaha really? With a dinner ticket over $200 you think they could at least spring for a scoop of ice cream, I mean really ? Dennys gives you a bigger birthday sundae than that. So for Cheescake factory beeing so cheap and for leaving the skin on the shrimp they get a whopping 2 stars."
