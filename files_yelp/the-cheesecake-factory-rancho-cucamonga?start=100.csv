Tiffany H.,"Indianapolis, IN",750,1102,2719,5.0,5/30/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory....an oldie chain but always a goodie. Most recently, I stopped by this location to get food to go. While they don't have the kale salad I love anymore, they NOW have avocado, zucchini & portobello fries. Just for those alone, I'm coming back to Cheesecake Factory (well, one closer to me). Perfectly crusted & salted - don't really even need the garlic aioli and other sauces they give you.  I also ordered a turkey burger - I love that buttery, buttery bun."
Alexis J.,"Riverside, CA",0,5,,2.0,7/18/2017,"I recently ordered my food door dash on my lunch hour, theFood was good until, my co worker found a what seemed to look like a beard hair in her zucchini as well I found the same looking one in my flat bread. it was quicker than I thought which was nice. But not being able to eat half of our food due to A strangers hair in two out of three of our dishes was a disappointment, being it is not very cheap.. Wish we didn't pay so much for being able to eat barley 1/3 of our original order. :( We order here at least once a week but sadly to say we won't be ordering from this location any longer."
DeJaniero A.,"Orange, CA",43,11,11,4.0,12/27/2016,Love the food & the service here. I had never ordered coffee. One cup of black coffee is 3.50. I wouldn't  complain but the coffee was awful   How can you get black  coffee wrong.   The service was awesome!
Pricilla Z.,"San Bernardino, CA",19,50,40,2.0,11/17/2016,"I USED to love this place.  After I ate my food. It was ok,  I would never get it again meat was too dry for my taste.  I also ordered a slice of pumpkin cheesecake to go. When I got home I realized she had packed a regular slice of plain pumpkin cheesecake.   What a DISSAPOINTMENT... Seriously for ok she was always in a hurry like rushing  when she was at the table,  food and not so strong drinks and ok service the bill was $87 and change for me and my kid plus $20% tip came to $105 for dinner. NOT WORTH IT"
Chuck M.,"Apple Valley, CA",0,3,,1.0,9/3/2017,"We eat here probably once every two months and order the same dish Bang Bang Chicken with shrimp each time but this time the shrimp was way over cooked. And just bye looking at it the chef had to know it was over cook, but why would you still serve it. Disappointing when you pay alot for the meal. But do they care, of coarse not they have there customers."
Stacy C.,"Walnut, CA",753,737,1249,3.0,11/23/2016,"Just due to sheer amount of patrons and voice noise, it's just not a particular restaurant I'd come to of my own choosing for dinner events. With that being said I did hear they have a nice breakfast which I'm willing to come and try. Also good news is that their breakfast omelettes are served all day which is terrific. I'd eat breakfast for all my meals if I could. LOL. I did order their Factory Making Omelette (? I might be recalling the name incorrectly) and created an omelette filled with spinach, tomatoes, mushrooms, and roasted peppers. The side I selected was house potatoes with a another side of fresh fruits (pineapples, orange, and blueberries). The filling was amazingly stuffed with vegetables, although the egg felt a little overcooked in my opinion, if it were a little more on the runny side it would've been better. The side fruits were my favorite and highlight of the dish since it had absolutely no melons (I'm allergic) by default and the fruits were all fresh rather than canned (LOVE!). The house potatoes were just mediocre though, I'm used to potatoes being baked/roasted/grilled but these were super deep fried (not a fan) instead. Although overall portion of the omelette dish was hella BUENO. Service and staff here are amazing though, they're friendly and really kind and accommodating to requests of all kind. They don't seem flustered by the amount of tables they have to serve and pay attention to and was very good at checking up on our table. But like I mentioned before I just hate the massive crowd that accumulates here and the waiting time for seats."
Matthew H.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,11,,1.0,6/27/2017,"Horrible service. Ashley B was our server. Drinks took forever to refill, We had to get up ourselves and find a server to refill them. Our whiskey took over half an hour to receive, same situation we got up ourselves to the bar and ordered separate drinks. Food misplaced, and cancelled appetizers because they never showed up. My Filet Mignon was under cooked and when management tried to resolve the problem, the chef either microwaved it or he was too lazy to do it right. Came out steaming and WAY over cooked, cancelled that as well. 2nd bad experience here, definitely not going back and would not recommend this location to anyone."
John T.,"West Covina, CA",0,7,,2.0,8/17/2017,"I love the Cheesecake Factory but I will not be going back to the Rancho Cucamonga store anytime soon. This is the second time I've gotten burned there. The service is very bad. The staff has a stale attitude. Not rude but it's like they don't believe in customer service from the hostess to the waiter. Our food took close to an hour. They got my sons order wrong. Normally things can be forgiven, but this is the second time we got poor service."
Cynna H.,"Corona, CA",33,5,8,3.0,12/31/2016,Too cold for patio seating. Managers need to care more about customer comfort. Server kept apologizing for the seating. Server was great.
Nancy O.,"Ontario, CA",25,30,1,2.0,7/3/2017,My food was cold!! I had to ask my server to nuke it ...Disappointed! !  He could of at least had a manager come by and ask if there was anything he could do for me!
Brandon C.,"Ontario, CA",790,4,,1.0,8/27/2017,"Definitely didn't have a pleasant experience for my Birthday. Server Rosie was super dope, but my everyone in my party had cold food. Very disappointed that I didn't eat."
Adium A.,"Upland, CA",1,99,133,2.0,1/16/2017,"Their quality control of their carrot cake has gone down big time. Carrot cake now tastes horrible and is very mushy. Carrot cake is also way too sweet. Portions have also become way smaller. Review update: I did let waitress know and she said this was how they have been recently. I had come in recently 3 times and all 3 times the carrot cakes have been the same. Too sweet,too mushy and and too soft. That is not how your cakes used to be in the past."
Rochelle W.,"Los Angeles, CA",36,69,37,2.0,12/21/2016,"The servers were not very good. It started with the water. I asked for lemon and didn't get any, had to adk twice more before getting any. I ordered soup and salad. In the menu where I ordered it doesn't say that cesar salad is a dollar more and the blonde server didnt bother to let me know the difference between the green salad and that one. The male server Carlos wasnt any better. I had to keep asking for things more than once. My coworker ordered to go but asked to bring it right before leaving. The food was brought in the beginning. She asked for the meat well done for the meal she asked for while dining in and that also didn't happen. I asked for a to go box and it was given to someone else. Carlos was just all over the place. I wished we would have gone to Claim Jumper for our Staff Christmas lunch."
Kellie P.,"Walnut, CA",15,25,25,3.0,2/6/2017,"Food is salty. My husband asked for brown rice and was served with white rice. I asked for lemon in my water and the waitress just brought me plain water with no lemon. My kids' grilled chicken is too spicy for them to eat due to too peppery. And only carrots on kids' plate when the menu said it comes with vegetables. Overall, not a great dining experience compared to other Cheesecake Factory locations."
Tamara T.,"Santa Ana, CA",413,910,2114,3.0,9/3/2015,"Been going here since it first opened and not so much lately. The service here is a hit or miss depending on the waiter or waitress we get, but I've had a 50/50 experience of great or horrible. I have a lot of family that visit from Australia/New Zealand and the highlight of their trip is the Cheesecake Factory. They go back home telling everyone about this great restaurant and when the next family member(s) come to visit they all want to try the famed Cheesecake Factory. We've had rude waitresses that give us attitude after we point out an error with our order to those that go above and beyond to deal with my picky dad. It's a long wait and I can't tell you if it's worth it or not, but if you love the food and don't want to wait I'd suggest calling in and ordering your food to go. At least this way you won't have a bad experience.   To address the food, everything is good especially the chicken dishes (Louisiana chicken pasta and chicken madera are my faves) . I'd recommend trying their strawberry shortcake as well as all of their cheesecakes!"
Ahmed J.,"Torrance, CA",68,22,1,4.0,8/2/2017,The chicken sandwich was just so so delicious! Really wish that I ordered some cheesecake because I feel it would also be great. The fries were also good however it seemed as though some of the fries were soggy.
J G.,"Bloomington, CA",0,7,2,2.0,6/19/2017,"My family and I had lunch today. The food was good not great, but unfortunately the service was awful. First the wait wasn't too bad only about 15 mins. But once we got to the table we waited for another 15 to get drinks or even order. We were asked if we wanted bread. Of course with starving kids we did. Then we proceeded to wait another 20 mins for bread and by then about 10 minutes later the food arrived. After that we forgot what our waiter looked liked because we didn't see him until he brought the check 25 minutes after we last saw him. Then he decided to refilled our drinks which we need to have done a long time ago. Don't think we'll be coming back anytime soon."
Mia F.,"Hesperia, CA",0,6,4,5.0,8/7/2017,We didn't stay to dine in so I can't rate that experience but I stopped in to grab a cheesecake to go. I tried the GODIVA CHOCOLATE CHEESECAKE (gluten free and flourless!) and it was Heavenly!! OMG it is so rich and decadent! I didn't think a gluten free dessert could be so absolutely delicious!  Now I'll have a problem staying away from this Godiva cheesecake.
Linh N.,"Colton, CA",3,60,53,4.0,7/26/2017,"We usually come here for lunch/dinner celebrations. Located at the corner of Victoria gardens (Day Creek). Typical fancy dishes, price and crowd. Bread is complimentary served warm, fresh and a side of butter. My all time favorite dish here is the asparagus garlic butter scampi. Love how they have a lite selection menu which is half of the regular portion size. Clean and spacious with outdoor seating availability. Of course, cheesecake is a must! Usually we leave satisfied, full with leftovers :)"
Ver P.,"Moreno Valley, CA",0,6,,4.0,8/12/2017,"On 06/17/17, my husband and I invited my family to eat here to celebrate our recent civil wedding. It was a very busy day as it was the day before Father's Day. We had a wait (about 20 minutes), as we were waiting for their big section for a large party. We ended up waiting about an hour because these two customers would not leave our section even though they were the only ones left. Cheesecake Factory did not want to kick them out, which is understandable. I felt like kicking them out myself! I did not though. I understand that people go eat and like to have conversations, maybe catch-up. But it is common courtesy that, if you see a bunch of people waiting to get a table, that you kind of speed it up and talk elsewhere.  They ended up seating us even though those two ladies were still there. Our servers, Leandra and Nick (I believe) were great. Leandra was our first server, and then Nick took over once she left. However, my mother-in-law's meal did not come along with everyone else's. The manager came to speak to her and apologized that a mistake was made. He gave her something for free. It was a very large party and very busy, so I can understand that mistakes are easy to make. Overall, good job Cheesecake Factory! We ate and then sat there talking for a very long time even though there was a huge wait time for others! Hahaha, okay I'm just kidding. We actually left once we paid and were finished with our meals. Food was good too."
