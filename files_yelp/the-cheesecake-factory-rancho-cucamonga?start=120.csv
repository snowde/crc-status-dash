Aymara S.,"Fontana, CA",0,3,,5.0,8/12/2017,"The food is amazing, I've had a taste of different dishes, their avocado rolls are delicious.  The service is wonderful,  courteous, and friendly.  It's great in quality and service.  It's reasonably priced; the service and quality of the food is better than what you pay for. I love this place  :)"
Jerry N.,"Upland, CA",0,9,,2.0,10/29/2017,"All good should be brought out at the same time, or at least within 1-2 mins. With as many employees are working here, that's not too much to ask.  3 burgers and one chicken meal."
Barbara F.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",739,125,777,2.0,3/16/2017,"So I have been coming here since they opened their doors about at least a decade ago and I can't believe this is my first time reviewing it. I frequently come here for dinners, birthdays, office lunches (here and at work), regular lunches, brunch, curbside to go etc. Ive rarely had issues and have always been a loyal customer. Last night wasn't the best experience. After a long day at work, I wanted to take a break from cooking dinner so my family and I can here. Let's start at the hostess table. I patiently waited my turn behind 2 groups of people. Somehow some girl sneaked in from the other side (which it was obvious wasn't the line) and instead of the ""male"" hostess attending to me since I had patiently been waiting, he decides to help her first. Strike #1. We sit down, order, and get some of our food. The fries my son got had plenty of burned (black) pieces of fries. He asked me ""Mom, why are they rotten?"" Strike #2. We get our bread and one looks as flat as a pancake and was very hard. Another one had a gaping hole in the center and was very hard. Strike #3. The server comes out with our food, and instead of placing it in front of me like every normal server, he holds it out and it stays suspended in front of me. Doesn't even courteously ask if I could take it from him. Anyways, I take it and set it in front of me. The other server who brought me my soup managed to set it in front of me and she was literally half his size. I even had to hand him my glass for a refill, which of course I don't mind doing but on top of that I had to hand him all of my plates for him to take all of this being asked of me by his ""give it to me"" hand gestures. I'm sorry but if I wanted to do all of this during dinner, I would have just stayed at home. Wow, just wow! Strike#4. The only reason why they get 2 is because the two new plates that we tried, the Carne Asada Medallion plate, and the Pineapple Shrimp and Chicken were good. It's really sad that I had to give you two stars Cheesecake Factory because on all the hundreds of other times I've been here I would have gladly given you five. Get it together!"
Gabriel R.,"Colton, CA",54,96,11,4.0,6/28/2017,When to have lunch and the service was fantastic. The waitress was very attentive and made sure our experience was a good one. The food was cooked to perfection and tasted great. The place looked clean and everyone seemed very friendly.
Dana M.,"Hemet, CA",4,14,,5.0,10/8/2017,"My husband and I had business to attend in this city on a Saturday morning. Before we traveled home we decided to grab lunch at The Cheesecake Factory (TCF). It is always good for a good meal and the menu offers a wide variety. It was about 11:30, and we were set at a booth right away. Our waiter, Ian, greeted us right away and got us set up right away with my very favorite, Green Iced Tea, and my husband, his usual dark diet soda and ice water. Mind you, I have dined at TCF many times, however I was immediately impressed by Ian's attention to detail. At this point, he even asked whether I'd like my tea with sweetener or on the side. In the course of our normal ordering conversation, Ian pointed out the brunch offerings located on a separate card within TCF's already comprehensive menu. We decided on Chicken Samposas as an appetizer. I chose the Monte Cristo Sandwich served with breakfast potatoes and my husband ordered a BBQ Burger and fries. Everything was so delicious and served with the utmost quality and level of personal service. Our drinks were refilled without asking, our tabletop kept clear of plates unintrusively as we finished aspects of our lunch. Even when Ian bade us farewell as he was going to have his own lunch, we were graciously handed off to Danielle who maintained the same level of service us us.  Though we ordered appetizers, my husband quickly devoured his meal and began to covet my extraordinary sandwich with his eyes. Knowing I was growing more full by the moment I offered a quarter of my sandwich, complete with a little dollop of the strawberry preserves (yes, I do love this man). His eyes rolled over in appreciation for my excellent lunch selection. I quickly assessed my stomach capacity; I would have room for the rest of my sandwich, but not my breakfast potatoes!  He could fill up on those. We were both well sated at the conclusion of our meal. Danielle asked if we had any room for dessert and we hastily declined (because I was so full-more food seemed out of the question). Danielle teased us to take dessert home for later, and again we declined. Instead, Danielle prepared my wondrous Iced Green Tea in a to-go styled cup and straw and we were on our way. I didn't quite make it out to the car without feeling that moment of regret, Why didn't I bring dessert home?! Good as it gets, I don't usually go to the mat and give out ""Excellent"" on my reviews; however Ian and Danielle with TCF food made this Saturday an excellent dining experience. Well done."
Takesha S.,"Redlands, CA",1,20,4,3.0,10/14/2017,Thursday night we had good service from Brandon. The food was really good always great portions and came out in pretty good time. However doesn't it always feel like that $8 slice of cheesecake gets smaller everytime? They sure don't reflect the photo's. It's as if they added an extra space to their precutting tool. Oh well
Steve P.,"Fontana, CA",10,17,1,2.0,6/2/2017,This place has bland food and the servers seem like they hate the fact that they work here.  Only reason I came here was because someone gave me gift cards.
Adam B.,"Chino, CA",16,105,84,4.0,4/2/2016,"Again, I don't normally wright about chain restaurants, but, here I go.  For the most part the food is excellent. It really is very good, but it does have some problems. I was sitting in the patio area with a direct view of the heat lamps where the food sits waiting for the servers to bring it to the good hungry people of the IE. I watched several plates sit and dry out for about 15 mins. I do this because I'm a Yelper. My shrimp and salmon was one that sat out a while because my potatoes were dry and stale. Still good, but the others in my party had fresher taters. The food is good but I think timing of the cooked food could be better.  The restrooms are a joke. Small and unpleasant. Cheese Cake Factory... You can do better.  Anyway, enjoy the food but be prepared to wait. It's busy and they don't take reservations. They should. Can I say that again? TAKE RESERVATIONS!"
Victor S.,"Wildomar, CA",1,4,,1.0,1/8/2017,"Just stopped by yesterday for lunch and ordered chicken which took over 30 minutes to make and still showed up pink and bleeding. Sent the food back and had to wait another 30 minutes to get my food back which at that point I had to take to go since my family was already done eating. After all that I asked to speak to the manager, and after it took him 10 minutes to show up he just apologized and gave us a free slice of cheesecake. Gesture was so insincere and dry that he either didn't really care or maybe is just used to doing it so often. If you order chicken here I would definitely check it thoroughly."
Eileen M.,"Cabazon, CA",0,61,34,3.0,1/7/2017,This place is always busy on a Saturday if your on a date I would suggest sitting at the bar it's convenient and fast. I don't usually come here because there is just to much of a variety and I feel like the only thing they specialize in is the CHEESECAKE of course. Anyhow if your not a heavy eater I reccom4yhe Chicken lemon Couscous. great for a date. large party's plan ahead
Jennifer T.,"El Monte, CA",19,11,10,1.0,6/3/2017,"Worst location I've ever been to.. the service was horrible! We ordered a root beer and a cup of hot water. The waiter came with a dirty cup,  the root beer came while we were almost done with our food. I also ordered a kids Alfredo pasta. When the pasta came out, the sauce was so watery that it legit looked like  milk... never coming back to this location."
Manny N.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",67,11,9,3.0,6/16/2017,"The food is good, ambiance is great, being at the mall is great. Only down side is that they don't have a lot of craft beer to choose  from. I was only able to enjoy Stones IPA. Yes this is a great place for a date night but if your a craft beer couple or person that needs a craft beer selection this might not be for you. More of a date night to treat your special someone and enjoy dinner."
Sue G.,"Petaluma, CA",0,16,,2.0,12/30/2016,"Went here last night. Very crowded which is apparently normal for this restaurant. Waiter started out good. Went downhill quickly. Took order, said he will bring bread- never happened. Ordered a drink - never happened. I noticed the other waitresses and they we were much more attentive than our guy. Did not give a good tip and I suspect he did not think about why. Seemed a bit distracted.  Food was ok - not stellar.  Too crowded to even being close to an enjoyable experience."
Jen L.,"Upland, CA",2,43,9,5.0,9/28/2017,What can I say about the Cheesecake Factory nothing bad of course. Awesome service. Clean restrooms. Fast service and delicious food who can ask for more than that at a busy restaurant love it
Mary A.,"Lake Elsinore, CA",8,36,30,5.0,3/18/2016,"Love it here. The food is so good. If you come try to get Heather she is so helpful will all my million questions. She is always on top of everything. Brought me an extra sauce for my wraps even without asking, she said it seemed like I would enjoy the peanut space on the side. Had her wait on us a couple times and every time she is wonderful!! Try the skinny Asian lettuce wraps with a side of peanut sauce on the side."
Fred K.,"El Monte, CA",34,16,,1.0,1/17/2017,"Went there yesterday and the service was terrible! Let me start by saying that I'm a big fan of the cheesecake factory, i usually go to the ones in Brea and Arcadia, but recently i have moved closer to the Rancho one. after a couple of visits me and my wife noticed that for some reason the food quality was not as good as the other ones for some reason, the Nachos which is one of our favorites appetizer there are either a hit or a miss, sometimes they are good, sometimes they are terrible. now for my last visit, which was yesterday, the service was horrible, we were on the patio and our server name was Rebecca's i think. we ordered the nachos and pork chops with sweet fries instead of mashed potatoes to share, the Nachos were a lot smaller than they usually are and had barely any cheese or chicken.  they brought out the pork chops without the fries and said that the fries would be ready in a minute, 2 minutes later our server stops by the table and says she will bring the fries right away, after that she disappeared for 20 MINUTES! no water refill, no service, nothing, when she comes back we told her that we never received the fries she asks if we still want them, but at this point we were done, we told her no and she said that she will take them off the bill, i wasnt sure how exactly that would workout since they were a side item included with the main entree but i said ok   When we got the bill, she had subtracted $1 from it!!! a WHOLE DOLLAR, its bad enough not receiving the side item and no service for 20 minutes but then to subtract only a dollar for that is a joke.  I would recommend going to the cheesecake factory in Brea or Arcadia instead of this one"
Allison L.,"Sacramento, CA",301,282,2340,2.0,3/17/2015,"I typically enjoy dining at Cheesecake Factory, but this location is not one of my favorites. I've dined at this location now twice, once for lunch and once for dinner.  When I came for lunch my party of four was seated pretty quickly. Our waitress was very nice and friendly, BUT oh my god ..... A lady in my party pointed out how DIRTY her shirt was! The waitresses and waiters all wear white blouses and white pants, but her armpits were STAINED YELLOW. We had to see this and then EAT?! It was really disgusting and made us all lose our appetite. The lady who pointed it out to me wanted to tell the manager how gross it was, but didn't want to embarrass the girl. Wow I really don't get why they don't have everyone just wear BLACK. Now that my eyes have been opened to this I always look for it. Ugh.  Lunch: I ordered the Renee special turkey sandwich that came with salad and cream of mushroom soup. The bread of the sandwich was incredibly hard and dry, as was the turkey. The salad had a vinaigrette that I did not like and the cream of mushroom soup was borderline disgusting. It tasted like Marsala sauce.. It was weird. Good thing I had brown bread to eat.  Dinner: bang bang chicken and shrimp. This was my second time ordering this and I didn't like it as much as when I had it at a different location. The sauce was a little too mushy and had too many raisins.  Also, when my coworker and I came for dinner we requested a table outside since it was so cold and dark inside. We were told 15 minutes and given a buzzer. 15 or so minutes later I heard the hostess calling my name... And my buzzer wasn't even buzzing.. So that was pointless. When we got to the patio there were 11 empty tables!! Uhh exactly what were we waiting 15 minutes for?! Our waitress was friendly enough, but that was annoying.  With all the other options nearby, this restaurant would not be my first choice."
Kevin L.,"Los Angeles, CA",270,247,743,4.0,9/5/2016,"Really busy on the weekends,   but food and service is excellent.  What more can you ask for.  Love the fact you can mix and match with the combination of salmon, steak, or scallop when you can decide what to order."
Jacqueline S.,"Rialto, CA",82,15,,1.0,6/1/2017,"Would have given it 3 stars, but the Manager was so RUDE.  We went there for a birthday party of 8 and one person had mash potatoes and had a big piece that was not cooked.  We ask for the manager who was lacking customer service etiquette and told her she can have more mash potatoes and when she said ""no"" this Rude man then asked if she wanted french fries and she said no thank you, do you think you can compensate a slice of pie?  Again with no apology and a bad attitude said no with a mean FACE!  She then asked him what can you do?  He said nothing but gave her two dollars off her bill.  What a JERK!  Our waitress Caitlin was slow and I wish we would of had this guy who had more tables and was bring food and drinks to his table fast while we waited and I watch him work like he was superman.  Don't think I will be back and if I do I will look for the guy."
Chris S.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",38,40,114,2.0,7/9/2017,"Well my son wanted to have lunch here today, so I agreed. We have eaten here several times in the past but I had not posted a review, well today they get one and it is not so great.  I love appetizers and their menu has an array of them. I ordered fried zucchini, mozzarella and potstickers.  The fried zucchini was good, light and crispy  panko style breading and zucchini was firm inside. It was served with ranch dressing that was to thin and runny. The potstickers were good. Nice presentation. Soy based sauce with black and white sesame. I love the shaved green onions.  The fried mozzarella was for my son and he didn't like it. Served as triangles instead of sticks and had another cheese inside don't know what but texture and taste was different. I ate one and there wasn't a lot of cheese inside and what was there was was not mozzarella.  I didn't care for it either.  So my son ordered spaghetti and meatballs. He ate about half and said he has gad better. I have the roasted pear and blue cheese flat bread. That was good. I would order that again. It had roasted pears, pecans, arugula, blue cheese and grilled onions. It was a good bite.  I also chose to partake in their specialty martinis. I have a blood orange martini and it was very good, but real sweet. Then I had a well mannered dirty martini with blue cheese stuffed olives. That was not so good. It was off balance and I couldn't taste any alcohol. It tasted like dirty water. I ate the olives and passed on the cocktail. Got the bill. $13.50 for each of those martinis. I thought that was a bit excessive. Won't be drinking cocktails there. I would run out if money before I caught a buzz. We did get cheese cake to go for the boys after all it is the cheese cake factory and that is something they do do well.   Would I go back?  Hmm, it is a chain restaurant and mist of the time it is a hit or miss. Today was a miss, but I will probably go back but certainly not on a consistent basis."
