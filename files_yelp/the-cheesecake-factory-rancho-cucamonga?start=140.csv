Amanda R.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",18,18,19,1.0,10/8/2017,"Party of two, we had a 2 minute wait for our table. The food however is a different story. Not only did it take forever, the party of four who was sat well after us received their food before us... thinking about just going over to The Melt..."
Reen C.,"Pasadena, CA",59,47,11,3.0,12/10/2016,"On Thursday about four of of us chose to meet at the Rancho Cuc CheesECaKe FaCToRy. The service was """"SKETCHY"""" WE had three different people  (waiters) come to our table periodically to either drop off food or pick up plates. This went on for two hours. None of the personal told us their name, so I can't properly Yelp the business.!!!! I  asked for a second Mojito and NEVER got it, once we asked for """"SPLIT CHECKS """" a NEW person showed up.(still NO name )"
Miss Z.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,10,4,1.0,7/4/2017,Had friends come from overseas so took them for dinner and as usual waited for 20 minutes to be seated which was still ok .. but here comes the fun part the server didn't come to the table for about 15 minutes so we were wondering if anyone was coming to attend us then our drinks don't arrive for another 20 minutes and appetizers follow after 10 minutes then the food starts coming in another 20 minutes later and they forget 1 persons food in our party.. don't know if the server forgot to put the order in or the kitchen messed up in the back but it  never came out until everyone was done eating .. finally had to cancel it. Some of the pastas we ordered were dry so had to get extra sauce on the side overall experience this time was not what we expected especially with our guests don't know if we will return again .
DiAnna A.,"Long Beach, CA",1,3,,1.0,9/16/2017,"I went to the Cheesecake Factory yesterday as it's one of my favorite places to go for Happy Hour from time to time.  However on this occasion I found hair in my food. After quietly informing the server I just asked for a simple replacement. Shortly thereafter I was greeted by a very tall Male manager informing me ""it was part of the dish and not hair, also stating it happens all the time."" He then proceeds to say he will take it off the bill and replace the food.  It was never taken off the bill however it wasn't ever a money issue as much as a service issue. I'm fully aware that ""Great Service beats out poor food any day."" I come from the industry and worked years in NYC 5-star restaurants so to be told that the obvious hair wasn't hair yet part of my dish was highly disappointing. I'm very familiar with the dish as I have ordered it for years, as well as the preparation it takes to make the dish so I was knowledgeable as to knowing it was hair. Yet I didn't want to be difficult so I just agreed and said a replacement would work perfectly.  I was sent out half of my replacement with no garnish and when I said that I barely ate any of my dish and I'm receiving half I was told ""this is all I was told to replace."" I then had to explain the situation which made it seem as if I was begging for extra food just to get the appropriate replacement.  I finally received the rest of the replacement just thrown in a to go box, again no garnish like the original.  I informed my server that I was very disappointed by the way the situation was handled. Instead of trying to make the situation right all I got was a ""I'm sorry, come see me again I'll take care of you."" I don't see that to be true when the first time was a disappointing experience. I'm not naming names because I don't want anyone to get into trouble however I would just use this as feedback for better staff and management training."
Ryan G.,"Long Beach, CA",0,4,,1.0,6/30/2017,"Horrible service from waiter & manager (Derick) extremely rude ! Waiting for my food over an hour meanwhile customers who were seated after us received their food & tab before us. After waiting so long I asked to speak with a manager (Derick) about my order & his solution was ""you can cancel the order & some one else can buy it"" .  Is this how managers really operate & treat their returning customers at cheese cake ? Never going back to that location again ."
Logan T.,"Diamond Bar, CA",0,9,4,2.0,8/8/2016,"Where do I begin with this Cheesecake factory. The one in Las Vegas, Bomb.  The one in Brea, bomb.  Literally anywhere but this one has been an amazing experience, so what the heck?  I came to this one one night with the fiancee and a couple of friends and the server was rude and not so cool to us.   We want more bread? Dude literally could not bring more bread to safe his job.  He served cold meals and had an attitude with us.   Never had I experienced this much displeasure from a Cheesecake factory.  Even the food was bad... and that is a first.  Maybe next time it'll be good but I won't be going back for another try, Brea location is perfect for me and the fiancee. Sorry Rancho location, you did not make the cut.  However, two stars because the atmosphere and cheesecake were good and you can't fu** that up."
Anjuli M.,"Fontana, CA",1,8,,2.0,10/4/2017,We always come here and the food and service is always great however tonight it was pretty bad. Ot took forever to order and get our meals. Wr probably waited for an gour and with no acknowledgement from our waitress for the wait. Ordered filet and steak medallions at Med rare. But they came out medium well and   tough. We had to send them back. The manager was running ur food and didn't say anything about the steak being overcooked. By the time we had recieved it everyone was done with their meal. We had to ask for boxes multiple times and after what seemed like endless waiting. After we were done eating dessert we waited for about 20min. Waitress comes back finally and we asked for our checks and she says oh you're ready ok. I had been wondering what she was waiting for to bring our checks since we waited 20 min already. The whole experience was just awful and with no acknowledgement of her taking so long. So bummed because usually we get great service
Danmo H.,"Montclair, CA",231,590,1953,3.0,7/19/2016,"No big news flash here--The food is consistently good and the cheesecake is amazing.  The skinnylicious meals are also appreciated when you don't want to end up with a wardrobe of stretchy pants.  However, I do not understand why do they do not take reservations when the restaurant is the size of a warehouse!  They also do not have an adequate waiting area.  Everyone waiting is crawling on top of each other.  And while I'm in the complaining mode, they do not have happy hour specials and the price of cocktails is ridiculous---in the $12.95 range.  This is not a high end restaurant/bar in LA or OC so why the gouging?!  My tip -- go have your cocktail(s) at one of the many other fine establishments in this mall and then stop in for your meal if you must.  Or the heck with it, eat somewhere else too and then just come get your cheesecake to go at the walk-up counter.  As that really is the shining star of this madhouse."
Jamie C.,"Corona, CA",79,8,,2.0,9/6/2017,"I realize this is super late and the team is probably different now, however, a couple of years ago this location charged me the amount of my bill three times. They then refunded one of the charges but I was still double charged. I called and spoke to the manager and he called me a liar over the phone even though I told him I'd show him bank statements and told me I had visited multiple times that day within the span of three hours and refused to look at the bank statements and refund the charge. Anyways, I have worked in restaurants for years and know mistakes happen but being called a liar and the complete lack of kindness shown towards me has kept me away since. This is a reminder to always keep a copy of your receipt."
Tonya A.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,4,,1.0,10/3/2017,Wow this is why we don't eat out. Food was horrible. Whole family left hungry for 70 dollars.
Jamie L.,"Bloomington, CA",340,313,271,2.0,4/18/2017,Today Me and my sisters and the birthday girl arrive d at 230 for lunch with my niece. Service was okay I understand it was busy so I am okay. But certain things took away.
Sigi V.,"Fontana, CA",1,9,48,4.0,8/14/2016,"Good food got the lemon herb chicken meal. The kids got pizza and sliders, yummy. The Stella was cold and good. The bread was a little hard but overall was good. We sat in the outside patio within 5 minutes for a busy Sunday. No room for cheesecake, next time. Overall a very good experience.  We will back soon."
Jeffrey B.,"Loma Linda, CA",199,169,150,4.0,4/4/2017,Cheesecake Factory obviously has multiple locations and a specific standard of food quality. Unfortunately I don't experience the same food quality with all locations. This one however was particularly good and I continue to go back. I love their food and it's always good. The staff are extremely courteous and typically the wait is shorter than what is expected. I mean when you're at Cheesecake Factory you have to try the cheesecake. I personally love the oreo flavor and have never been disappointed in their cheesecake.
Blaqbyrd B.,"Laughlin, NV",143,13,17,1.0,4/25/2017,"This is my second time here, my first visit was very nice, but this visit was the worse. Fist of all they served us the appetizer breads that was hard as a rock, our mixed drinks were watered down, after placing our order, and receiving our appetizers, we never heard from our server again. She disappeared with no trace. Over an hour passed still no server no service. The cost of this food,  they should give much better service than this, im really surprised at cheesecake factory."
Jong K.,"Apple Valley, CA",0,3,,1.0,2/25/2017,"I drove one hour to have my wife's favorit food. Last time I come here was about a year ago. Food was good like before but service and management was worst ever I had. It took 10 minutes to take drink order and her face told me 'I am busy, just eat food and go home.' I asked her box my food, and 5 minutes later she brought 5 to go boxes without plastic bag.  So I called manager to complaine about service then I realized where bad service come from. The Manager wear shirts without name tag (server didnot have either) lean on wall and put one hand inside pocket while I explain. His face showed me 'I do not care about asian people's complain.'  I wanted give all tips to busser who worked hard with smile. I went on Feb. 25th 2017 4pm."
Dan W.,"Anaheim, CA",145,494,505,5.0,2/29/2016,What a busy place... I have to give this place a hats off for the great service they did provide regardless of how really busy they were. The staff is great and the food was great!!! This is a great place for dinner!!! great for desert too... Way to go Cheesecake Factory!!!   AAA+++   You are the best!!! Great Service and great food!! What else is better than that?
Michele B.,"Apple Valley, CA",15,40,6,3.0,9/30/2016,"So, I I have dined here on many occasions and never had a complaint. This particular dinner was for my birthday and everyone's plates we're quite good however my shrimp scampi was lukewarm at best. Once our food was delivered our waiter who was very good and quite entertaining had just been sat a large party so he wasn't able to check back right away and when I was able to tell him about my shrimp he did offer to refire it however I didn't want to wait.  Instead of offering something else or even bringing dessert for my birthday nothing was done I was a little disappointed but I didn't want to make a big fuss with the other people in our party there. I thought they do something for birthdays but I guess not. I will dine again but if my food is not up to my expectations I will ask for a manager."
Jera D.,"San Bernardino, CA",0,5,,1.0,9/7/2017,"This place needs major help. It was Mom's 66th birthday with a total of 8. It's a Thursday night at 9. How bad can it be? Definitely seemed understaffed which led to a 20-30 minute wait, which the hostess mentioned that she needed to ask for a manager to offer a wait time, when I asked what the wait time would be (okie). I accepted that there was a wait. I get called back up to confirm my phone number. Confirmed and sit back down. Cool. They will text when our table is ready. Except 30 minutes went by and still no text / table. My sister went up to ask because at this point its 9:30PM. No one is in the place. Their response: it will be about 15 more minutes to set up the table, which our reaction would be like any normal person's reaction: holy cow 20 to 30 to 45 when no one is there Hahaha! Crazy thought. Open tables all around. People ate and left in the time that we were waiting.  Getting a little frustrated we discussed the fact that maybe we should just do take-out. I asked for menus and we browsed. The man then says ma'am they are setting the table it up. My reaction, again, like any normal person, ""it's been 45 minutes. This is unacceptable. No one is even here"". We start browsing menus and I get up to see if the table is still being prepared. I was then told by the hostess, ""Oh you grabbed menus for takeout."" We didn't think you wanted it anymore "". And repeated and repeated in a rude and condescending way of course, which I then said yes, thank you, is the table available?"" So they said, yea would you like to be seated?"" Would I like to be seated??!!! Like any normal person: What have I been waiting for 50 minutes on???!!! Am I right?! Then I said I would, but I'd like to speak to a manager first. And he was  right there. This whole time this jack rabbit had been listening and didn't think to intervene. Then I said, ""we been waiting for a table for about 50 minutes now. Couldn't someone approach us and ask if we did want the table after all"". The ""I'm the manager"" was already in a manner that you wouldn't say wow this guy is a professional, but then proceeded to flat out argue the fact that I didn't want a table because he saw that I got take-out menus. 1. Don't argue with an upset customer 2. Diffuse the situation and check in with people. Don't assume. Anyways, after everyone heard his arguing with me and just the exhaustion from the whole ordeal, we were ready to just leave. Yard House is a hands-down better choice. Don't waste a second on this place. Hopefully this will catch the attention of someone in upper management because this wasn't the first time leaving upset here for me and people don't want to pay for a $50 cheesecake and 20% gratuity to be told off while waiting the whole night. And by upper management I don't mean the jokes of managers that were in there tonight."
Nellie W.,"Los Angeles, CA",79,235,162,3.0,8/8/2016,Came on a Sunday for lunch. The wait was pretty long. I had a pizza and a salad and my pizza came out burnt. That was a bummer since I was craving pizza. Of course it was removed from our bill with no hassle. Customer service was great. The strawberry lemonade is amazing.
Keisha H.,"Los Angeles, CA",78,258,170,4.0,1/2/2016,"You can never go wrong at the CCF. We shared pot stickers they were perfect. The sauce is amazing!  I had the orange chicken, always the best white meat chicken!!! Staff was nice.  Victoria Gardens will be my new go to spot since I'm moving  to the IE. I love CCF some people say it's over rated but I've been eating at CCF for almost 20 years, I think I've had a less than savory experience once. I think that's pretty awesome.  Ask your server what they like.  The menu is really big. Share meals, experiment.  It's easy to fall in love with this place.  Also the Happy Hour is how you can get a lot of good stuff on the cheap!"
