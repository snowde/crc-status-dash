Berlynn C.,"Chino, CA",104,2,,1.0,12/28/2016,"My family and I ate here last night it was our first time and we were excited to try it out. We arrived around 7:50 and it was extremely packed and were told it would be a 30-40 minute wait for our party of 5 and a child. So we seemed that was a fair time to wait since they seemed very busy. 8:30 comes around and we are starting to notice most of the parties that put their name in around the same time we did had gotten sat so we kept telling ourselves we should be next. When it hit 8:40 we went up to ask how much longer since we started to notice people that got there after us were getting sat. The hostess told us oh you guys are next. I am a server and understand how it is when it is busy but I began to get upset when I saw other parties of 5 getting sat. Now it's 8:50 and has been a full hour we are waiting so we go up again to ask and they tell us the same thing ""we're next"". I hate to complain but I felt it was time to speak to a manager. She apologized and sat us right away. She offered a complementary appetizer which I really appreciated and just hoped the rest of our visit would be great. Well, unfortunately it was not. Our FIRST server came up to us and grabbed our drink order right away and when she brought the drinks she said she would be back with bread and to take our order. She came back about 10 minutes later with another server and said she was going on break and the other server is taking over. That other server said hi and said she would be right back. Our complementary appetizer came out that was great but it was 9:30 and we had gotten sat around 9. Finally that server comes back and takes our order and brings bread after 30 minutes of being sat. My poor 7 year old brother was starving so we gave him bread to try to hold him off until the food came. The food begins to come out and of course my little brother's comes out last. So all of us are sitting there not eating until his food comes maybe about 5 minutes after the rest of our food. They did not even bring all his food they brought his chicken first then the fries a few minutes later. We were hoping the manager would come back and check on us to make sure the rest of our visit was better but she did not. After being there for almost 3 hours we did not want to take the time to find her again. Our first and last time that we will be coming here. It's unfortunate because the food was delicious but our entire experience was ridiculous."
Clay C.,"Corona, CA",107,6,3,3.0,4/12/2017,Says they take reservations but they don't please change that! Don't get why restaurant stop taking reservations I don't want to be sitting there for an hour on my girlfriend's birthday waiting for a table to open
Paul P.,"Fontana, CA",10,154,369,4.0,3/20/2016,"Very big menu lots to chose from.  Appetizer, EggRoll sampler  Firecracker Salmon, Avocado, South West and of course the Crispy Cuban skip the other go for this one,  taste just like a Cuban sandwich.  Steak Diane with Grilled Salmon and Mashed Potatoes, Asparagus . Steak  nicely cook medium rare, Salmon moist and juicy great dish. Chicken Avocado sandwich good size portion moist and delicious. Of course you can't forget the Cheese Cake Lemon Raspberry Cream Cheese outstanding. The only bummer is waiting to get in and very small tables for two along with how small the piece of Cheese Cake has gotten."
Ricky A.,"Fontana, CA",0,10,15,1.0,9/22/2017,"Came here to celebrate my wife's birthday. Very busy due to 1/2 off cheese cake, which I'm ok with. Waited for 45 minutes to get a table, which I'm ok with. What I'm not ok with is that our waitress did not check on us for over 40 minutes after she got our order, not even to refill my water. After 45 minutes, I finally asked another waitress to check on our food... and with an attitude she said that they are very busy because of the 1/2 off cheese cake. I was startled because I asked her in a very polite manner if she can please check on our food. Anyway she came right back with our food and not only were they cold but they forgot my sons order. He had to wait another 10 minutes, we ended up asking for a to go box for his food. Either our waitress went on her break with out telling anyone or she told someone and they forgot to cover. Asked to speak to the manager and he was also rude, he kept asking me what do you want me to do? Instead of asking me what I want for him to do? Find out what caused the problem and explain to your guess what you are going to do to prevent this from happening to another guess. You think a guess is asking to speak to you so we can get free food? Understand whats causing most of your bad reviews and utilize it as a tool to better your business, instead of looking for excuses. I recently went with my business partner to Olive G. While we were eating our waitress asked us how we were doing and stated that she will be going on her break and she introduced us to the waiter that was going to cover for her...That level of detail is what compelled me to write this review....Good service can save a bad meal but there is no level of food that can save a bad service....Alton Brown"
Ruiqiu K.,"Loma Linda, CA",32,580,7,4.0,7/22/2016,"Came in with a group. Saw a bunch of other groups from the company; seems to be the place to hold your staff luncheons. They are big enough to host many large groups at once. We had outdoor reservations, so we didn't have to contend with the dark interior of the main parts of the restaurant. As per usual, deciding from their extensive menu was the hardest part; everything always sounded good. A couple of our people had the foresight to order cheesecake to go separately at the counter before we even sat down. Smart move; wish I had done that. I've been to several of their locations. And I'm always impressed at how consistently good the food has been. Had one of their specialty burgers with fries, and opted not to have dessert. Portions are big enough that you shouldn't have to eat like a glutton in one sitting (but you do, anyway). Serving staff was on point and were available to ask us often enough if we had everything we needed."
Audrey B.,"Loma Linda, CA",184,18,2,3.0,4/2/2017,The restaurant is kind of too dark for my taste to be eating at because I can't see my food but the service was good I am the salad was a little overdressed but it was still very good. And of course by far the cheesecake was phenomenal
Alia B.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,3,3,3.0,5/3/2017,Was seated and waited over 15 min for the server to come. Food is always good never had issues with that.. place is nice and clean
Tish W.,"Moreno Valley, CA",17,133,183,4.0,1/30/2017,"Let me start by saying our waiter Sunny was great. We had a party of 9 and he kept the bread coming. This location is pretty busy on a Saturday night with lots of large parties. The hostesses at the front dropped the ball for me. When we got there they didn't have any more pagers and  all they asked for was our name. Come to find out they were suppose to get a cell phone number to text us that our pager was ready.  They never texted we went back in and the young lady was rather disturbed and gave us a pager, then proceeded with attitude to let us know that we still had a 55 minute wait. No customer service skill there. But like I said in the beginning Sunny made up for that.  Our food was decent although they get my order wrong and put mayo on my sandwich. Not Sunny fault I saw him write no mayo.   Other than those two little quips our evening was decent. Wish they took reservations for large parties. Just so you know Sunny got them 4 stars, the hostesses got 2 stars."
Marie M.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",4,13,4,2.0,2/26/2017,"I've always enjoyed coming here because the service is great and I love the complimentary bread basket. But the last couple of times I've been here the quality of the food had been less than exceptional. For example,  my sister ordered a salad and received days old lettuce. Last night my family and I gathered to celebrate my sisters birthday. I ordered Evelyn's Favorites which was tasty with morsels of brunt broccoli that I could not eat get myself to eat.  When my sister received her avocado rolls they were prepared with rotten avocado!! Even our server was shocked that the prep team let that slide--she was kind enough to replace it with a fresh order. What I don't understand is the lack of consistency that should be present no matter how busy it is. We're paying gourmet prices for mediocre meals and for me that is unacceptable."
Stavros V.,"Glendora, CA",1,6,1,1.0,4/19/2017,"Worst experience I've had at a Cheesecake Factory. We had to ask 3 times for a booster seat for my gfs son... and when the food came out it was terrible. I sent it back, and the server didn't even offer to have it taken off or replaced. When I mentioned it to the server giving us our bill, the manager came by and said he had to conduct an ""investigation"" into the matter in which he spoke to our original server. I took three bites and sent it back but had to pay for half the meal. I guess a lots changed since the last time I visited! Won't be coming back, that's for sure!"
Carla M.,"Chino, CA",660,82,8,5.0,1/22/2017,Phenomenal food and service. By far one of the best locations I have been too. Perfect for just lunch or a nice family dinner. The bread is amazing !!
Enid R.,"Loma Linda, CA",45,4,3,2.0,3/29/2017,"Honestly, today we received the worse customer service ever. Two out of 6 plates were return. Not only the plate appearance was lacking the quality of the Cheesecake Factory but the flavor of both the Herb Salmon and the Luisiana chicken pasta was terrible. The salmon sauce tasted very unpleasant and the pasta was extremely oily and not cooked evenly (it was hard). Last but not least, my fried found a bug in her salad!!  Well, after so many valid complaints the manager came and literally did not even apologized. He agreed on taking back 2 of the plates and asked the birthday girl if she was ok with her salad (the one where she found the bug) since she was eating it despite the fact the put aside the 4 legged friend.  I can't believe he (the manager) did not even apologized or insisted on taking that nasty bug of the table. I am extremely disappointed. He should have display a different approach since apparently someone in the kitchen, under his management, was not doing doing their job correctly.  Costumes should not have to undergo such a negative experience, specially from such a recognized brand ""The Cheesecake Factory"".   Hopefully someone with higher power within the company can see this message and do something to improve poor customer service and avoid anyone else from passing through such an embarrassing situation."
Timothy B.,"Fontana, CA",0,13,,1.0,3/29/2017,"I have been a long time frequent Cheesecake Factory customer. I went  yesterday and for the first time was completely disappointed with the food. I often order the chicken and biscuits. They changed the recipe. It's now awful. The biscuit is like very dry, like biting into a styrofoam cup. The mashed potatoes and gravy taste different. The mashed potatoes were dry. The bravura tasted like it came straight out of an outdated can of something awful. Another person also had the bad mash potato experience.  Service was very slow, but accommodating. Easily replaced my meal with a microscopic portion of fish and chips (these were very good).  I will go back. Perhaps there is a new chef. Everyone is entitled to a bad day."
Bernadette P.,"Covina, CA",5,27,12,4.0,6/8/2016,"A night away from the kids to eat something I didn't have to cook! That in it self deserves a star. Anyway, on to the review...I ordered the fish and chips and substituted the corn succotash for the fries.  The succotash was slightly burned,  and the fish was way overcooked. The coleslaw was tasteless. The fish inside the batter was nearly petrified.  The server agreed and cheerfully  suggested another dish. I ended up with the factory meatloaf. It was decent and the portion was very generous. Albeit, rather cold for a meatloaf and gravy dish.  I'd order it again.  Kudos to Valerie for taking care of us and suggesting a different dish.  Couldn't go wrong with the white chocolate raspberry cheesecake for dessert and it didn't disappoint."
Shirley M.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,19,,4.0,5/1/2017,"My husband and I love eating at this Cheesecake Factory! The service is good, the decor lovely and most important the food is good! They have a huge menu so we never get tired of the same thing. We can always try something new! We will continue to eat here!"
Josh L.,"Colton, CA",77,54,70,5.0,2/20/2016,This location is always super busy but it's always more than fully staffed. The staff is very efficient and courteous too. The beer selection is okay.  The food on the Skinnylicious menu is surprisingly flavorful considering it's low cal.  Try the steak medallions.
Anthony G.,"Los Angeles, CA",187,2,,1.0,3/18/2017,The worst service we have ever had! Almost 2 hours of waiting for our food. The food came out cold. And the manager came out and said they were busy when the other tables got their food around. I'm so upset. I go to other cheesecake factories and their service is amazing. I'm sorry to saying I will never ever go to another Cheesecake Factory just for this experience.
Danny H.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",99,25,8,1.0,12/22/2016,"Long overdue review.  Was here a couple of months ago with a total party of 4 and service was incredibly slow for a Sunday night dinner.  Our main waitress, and I use the word 'main' because we were served by 3 different women throughout the night, was constantly missing.  We had to keep flagging other wait staff to find her.   At the end of our meal, we waited 20 mins to place an order for desserts.  Waited an additional 20 mins and when we finally had had enough, flagged down a wait staff that wasn't our waitress to find out about our order.  We wanted to cancel our dessert and just get the bill.  Manager comes by and apologizes because apparently the ticket system for the dessert area was broken.  We told her that's fine and that we would like our bill.  She then tells us she would take care of the cheesecakes so thinking because she added the 's' at the end of the word, we would all get comped dessert, we put in our order again.  When we get the bill, we see that only one dessert was comped, so once again we had another wait staff flag down our waitress because she is missing again.  We explained to her that the manager told us that the dessert would be comped and she goes and grabs the manager.  Manager comes by and explains she meant she would only take care of one.   We told you we wanted the bill with no dessert and you think by only taking off one, it would compensate the amount of time we had to wait?  We were ready to leave.  Who cares about saving $9 for waiting 40 mins for dessert?  All 4 dessert should have been comped.  Never coming back here again and will definitely talk people out of coming to this location."
Michael P.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",609,45,27,3.0,6/13/2016,"I wanna love this place , but every time I eat there it's something, server has a finger in my food as they serve the plate or the toast is only toasted on one side or burned or the butter is as hard as a rock as u apply it to the amazing brown bread it tears your bread to pieces , today I had the worst omelet, loaded with way toooooo much cheese & half cooked bacon , great atmosphere, servers do try hard ,but there is always a stuck up looking worker at CCF , not sure if I care to go back ,I can't ever see my self waiting in line for a meal at CCF"
Brian H.,"Upland, CA",0,10,,1.0,3/25/2017,"My review is for curbside takeout.  I arrived and had to park in loading, since no curbside spots were available. I called twice for curbside service but it just kept ringing.  Went inside and waited through the to go line to finally get my food.  It took 40 minutes from the moment I pulled up to the moment I pulled away.  Not the service I expect when I pay over $70 for take out.  Food was good, but cold.  Needless to say I won't be ordering take out from them again."
