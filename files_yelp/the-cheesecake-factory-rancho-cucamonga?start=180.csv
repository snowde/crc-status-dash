Ross T.,"Highland, CA",2,118,88,4.0,1/26/2017,Serivice was fast and friendly. Food was cooked as expected. Asparagus was tasty. Lunch was conducted as smooth as possible.
Tammy T.,"Diamond Bar, CA",54,109,10,4.0,12/27/2016,"I love coming to this location. It's usually very busy on Saturdays (wait is usually about an hour or more), but it isn't bad at all on weeknights or Sundays (about 20 minutes wait). The service here are wonderful and the food tastes delicious, however there were a few times when I was given a broken pager so I waited much longer than I should've, so my word of advice is to track your wait time and once it is over the expected wait time, double check with the front hostess to see if your pager works."
Merrill M.,"Costa Mesa, CA",458,472,38,4.0,6/2/2016,"You can never go wrong with CF. After the fact that the wait on a weekend is always about 90 mins is crazy but worth it. After looking over the menu book I finally decided on the Thai salmon.  Great choice, love curry flavors and the salmon was not dry.. The sauteed veggies were good as well.   Service is usually gauge by how many minutes does it take to refill my water but they were on point. Good stuff. Thanks CF"
D J.,"Lancaster, CA",5,122,7,5.0,8/12/2016,"I know it's a chain,  but I had to review this place.  I've been to two different locations now.  One in Ontario and one in Sherman Oaks. Both visits were great.  My g/f and I did the Whole30 challenge and broke the diet together on day 31 at the Cheesecake Factory.  We figured go big or go home.   We had carmel macchiatos,  avacado rolls,  pastas, and banana cheesecake.  So good!"
Daniel H.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,7,,2.0,4/2/2017,Two stars only because the food was good as always however the service was absolutely terrible. Lady said our food was ready and it will be out in one minute but that turned into 15-20 minutes. After less than 5 minutes of eating she comes by asking do I want a box to go. I ordered two cheesecakes to go and she forgot about that for another 10 minutes and caused my lunch date to be late for her meeting.
Marcus N.,"West Covina, CA",1,10,,3.0,3/31/2017,"My fiancé and I found ourselves in Victoria Gardens with nothing to do and we were both hungry so we decided to stop into The Cheescake Factory. She had been there several times before but it was my first time. I was impressed with the huge menu that had something to offer for everyone. We decided on Nashville chicken nuggets as an appetizer (which were great by the way) and after receiving our nuggets we felt as if we were forgotten about because our server hadn't checked on us for quite some time. We then started to look around and noticed that people who were sat while we were eating our appetizer were now receiving their meals and we were sitting in front of an empty table still. After attempting to be as patient as possible another 25 minutes passed by and we had to ask for the manager. The manager arrived just as our food did and assured us he would figure out what the issue was and how to resolve it. He came back to inform us that there was a misunderstanding about who our server was and that our order wasn't put in until just a few minutes before we received it. After apologizing several times he offered to box up our meals for us and assured us that customer service is usually much better and hoped we'd return to give them another chance.  Well, we will definitely be coming back to The Cheescake Factory to give it another shot because of the way that the manager handled the situation. Unfortunately, we didn't catch his name and wish we had. We would really like to thank him again for his hospitality. We will be returning soon and will update our review."
Nicole M.,"Gaslamp, San Diego, CA",0,19,2,2.0,3/4/2017,We came on a whim hoping for a minimal wait. We were fortunate to get a short wait and took the first available patio table. We have come so many times before and of course the wait can detour you from staying Unfortunately the food was sub par at best. The Cesar salad was wilted and not fresh and my pasta looked as if it had sat under the heat lamp for an hour. The noodles were dry and hard. The only thing that was pleasant was the server. Which is why I didn't put one star
Meena S.,"Diamond Bar, CA",0,38,1,2.0,3/3/2017,"I really use to like going to cheesecake factory but the last couple of times I have gone to this one in VG, it makes me sad to say I'll have to think twice before going there. Our server didnt look happy, seemed too busy. Our waters came our after 10 min and the bread came out after 20 min with our appetizers. I had asked for lemon in my water, which didn't happen. The avocado rolls were good, but the main dish was too peppery. We asked for bread and that didn't come either, despite asking twice. during the time our waiter just passed us and didn't care to ask how we were nor any refills on drinks, etc. At the end, no dessert was asked he just gave us our check and left. The last couple of times we had visited, it was mainly the servers that had the same attitude, and no courtesy.  Hope they improve in this aspect."
Alexis W.,"Montclair, CA",141,1,3,1.0,4/17/2016,"I've never in my life have felt so disrespected, unwanted and uninvited in a restaurant before a day in my life ! The service was shitted , the vibe was horrible and the food was DISGUSTING!! I was ordered to sit in the back because apparently everything was full but that was total bullshit because I seen so many empty seat and don't come at me with maybe it was reserved because that's a damn lie ! I asked to speak with a manager and when I did he was so uninterested in what I had to say and when I asked to speak with someone higher then him he completely ignored me and went about his business. Extremely disappointed and will most definitely be taking some serious action. 100 stars down"
Kingsfan L.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,202,6,5.0,2/7/2017,"My hubby and I went on a sou me date and My oh my this place knocked my socks off.  It takes a while to get seated but it's to be expected since this place is so good. The waitress we had was a doll and never let us see the bottom of our glasses.  The avocado rolls were the best I have ever had and the Madeira chicken was perfectly seasoned and cooked.  All I'm all we walked out of there saying "" man! They really know what they're doing""   thanks for impressing us"
Kiran K.,"Anaheim, CA",0,15,,1.0,8/4/2017,"This review is just for this location only . Otherwise i am such a big fan of cheesecakefactory . But this location sucks. We happened to be in ontario mills to watch movie and ended up here for dinner . Trast me me horrible service.. the server looked in really bad mood and didnt paid any attention . All she was telling us was she cant even find glasses to gove us watsr., then we waited 30 mins for her to take order... Appetizer attived when we were done eating .. .

They made my favourite dish ( Chicken Madera) Worst.., i hot so upset at Bad quality and taste that i will think twice before eating Cheesecake Factory again."
Charize M.,"Chino, CA",2,23,16,4.0,2/18/2017,Celebrated my birthday here thanks to my loving husband..it was a long wait but it was worth it...my 12 guest enjoyed their food and cheesecake..definetely coming back..
Andy O.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",1,45,30,5.0,3/11/2017,Amazing service and great food options a bit pricey but worth it because of all the selections that you get. And nice classy enviorment
Leena A.,"Fontana, CA",4,49,46,4.0,5/9/2016,"We went here for Mother's Day! There was a long wait as expected but worth the wait. I ordered without looking at the menu because I knew what I had wanted. Since it was Mother's Day, I had it all planned. As I ordered, the waitress told me the pear and endive salad was no longer offered. I was sooooo sad!!!!! I ordered the barbecue chicken salad but barely had any chicken on it! I still enjoyed the salad.... My family enjoyed the pizza and chicken Madeira. The coffee was great and service was awesome! I will go here again!"
Carole S.,"Temecula, CA",1,310,9,4.0,5/27/2016,I really like this chain.  The food is pretty consistent in each of the locations and is always good.  The large variety of food is also good as everyone in your party is sure to find something they will like.  We come here often when we are visiting the area.
Emily F.,"Temecula, CA",0,19,2,1.0,1/13/2017,No response from anyone after completing the website information as requested over 2 weeks ago on 12/22
Leilani Laisa T.,"Anaheim, CA",460,281,1456,5.0,6/28/2015,"After writing to the CF thru their website I was contacted by Jeff, a manager at the Cheesecake Factory.  He apologized for the actions of the aforementioned employees and told me to ask for him if I came back so that he could make sure I had a good experience.  I'm very impressed and relieved that the company takes these issues seriously and a sincere apology is all I needed.  Props to corporate and this individual location for caring about your customers and your guest service!"
Nicolas B.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,71,12,5.0,7/14/2016,"I'm going to be honest here, I probably come to Cheesecake Factory too much. Well that wouldn't be possible if they didn't make some of the best food I've eaten since being out here. Wine pairs great with the warm bread they bring out to your tables. The chipotle pasta is my fave, hands down, mostly because my wife and I are able to both get full from this plate!  You're sure to have a grand time here, thanks CKF!"
Katie R.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,30,,5.0,2/17/2017,What a wonderful place to eat.Salmon is great and cappuchino is so good .People are nice .I enjoy this place
Meygan A.,"San Clemente, CA",11,12,1,2.0,4/21/2017,Came in as a party for 8. Beginning was great until they forgot a family members meal. They kept coming saying soon it'll be out but it never came out. Since it took so long we had to take it to go and my family member couldn't even eat the meal with the family. Best of all they didn't even take it off the check. They gave us a cheesecake of course because it was way cheaper then the steak she ordered.
