Ataru N.,"Hesperia, CA",10,372,181,4.0,3/12/2016,"I first tried Cheesecake Factory in MD on a date with a guy I met when I was in town for an anime convention in the late 90s. The love affair has continued for 15+ years... (With Cheesecake Factory, not the guy.) I am not a huge fan of chain restaurants in general, but of the chains, Cheesecake is my favorite. Huge portions, consistent quality, open relatively late, quite an array of choices that don't suck, modern, lush decor reminiscent of themed luxury hotels in Vegas (it's no wonder that this chain was chosen for the Grand Lux Cafes in the Venetian and the Palazzo), and good if not incredible service. The fresh and hot bread they give for free is as good as or even better than bread I have paid extra for at high-end restaurants. Not everything I have had here is good, hence the 4 stars instead of 5, but the things I like are pretty consistent. We always share the chicken marsala with mushrooms and bowtie pasta, plus something else new, usually chicken something. The bowtie pasta (angel hair or spaghetti is another story) is almost never overcooked (hard to find in Italian restaurants especially out here). It's always enough for at least 2 or 3 meals. Unfortunately for a place with cheesecake in their name, they don't have any cheesecakes, or any desserts really, that I don't find way too sweet to bother ordering. I can't stomach more than a bite or two. We've given up on desserts here. Service can suffer a bit when they're busy, but I find that having an understanding attitude about their being swamped always gets me better service. The worst service I ever had here was a girl who was just phoning it in, she wasn't even rude or anything. Bathrooms are usually clean and there isn't usually a wait except during high traffic times. I try to avoid this place on Friday and Saturday evenings. I like the ""eye of Sauron"" lamps at all the booths. Some dishes we consistently enjoy:  * Ahi tuna tartare - the sauce this comes with is delectable, and I like the deep-fried wonton chips, though I usually don't at other places (too greasy)  * Ahi tuna carpacchio - this comes with a different sauce which is equally delectable  * Chicken marsala - TBH even though this is my favorite dish, it borders on sweet, just below the level beyond which I would find it inedible Some dishes we tried once and liked:  * Portobello, avocado & zucchini sticks (I prefer the portobello ones; the zucchini sticks are too soggy and the avocado is too ripe and mushy)  * Chicken Madeira  * Pasta da Vinci - basically the same as the Chicken Madeira but with penne instead of mashed potatoes  * Chicken with Lemon Couscous - delicious, but was Israeli couscous, not regular couscous, which was not what we expected based on it being called just ""couscous""  * Crusted Chicken Romano  * Chicken Piccata - but the angel hair pasta was overcooked  * Chicken Parm Sandwich As I mentioned, the chicken dishes we've tried so far have mostly been wins. I am not a fan of white meat, finding it too dry and stringy, but here the chicken breast is almost always tender and moist. The worst chicken dishes we had here (Chicken Bellagio and Chicken di Pana) were still okay, just not as good as the others, and not good enough to have again. Some dishes we tried once and disliked:  * Fried mac and cheese balls (the Mac Daddy cheese balls at Fred 62 are much, much better)  * Burger - don't remember which burger exactly, but it was underwhelming for a restaurant burger; cooked to death (well past well done) even though we asked for it to be as rare as possible, but I understand that cooking ground meat to less than medium is scary for many restaurants (although if they are an A, I don't understand not being able to go to medium rare or medium).  * Chicken samosas were okay but with their egg roll wrappers and meat-only filling, not samosa-like enough. I want to try some of the other dishes, like the steak, but the chicken is so good I don't know when we'll get around to them."
Romaine W.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",1,5,,3.0,6/27/2017,"Wait staff, food and ambience good. Birthday restaurant it is not. I was offered a milk shake like dessert. I am lactose intolerant. I asked for maybe a strawberry? Cookie? Fruit?  I was told there are no substitutes per Coroorate. It's hard to believe Corporate doesn't csre anout customer satisfaction when there are so many choices out there...and this is petty but I was told they would sing happy birthday and they didn't... mediocre"
Amy M.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",1,11,,5.0,12/24/2016,"I came here on Christmas Eve with my sisters. I ordered the orange chicken and the original cheesecake, both of which were amazing. The real highlight of our night was our sever Brandon B. He was so funny, teasing me when I ordered an original cheesecake. He called me boring. Whatever it was good lol. Anyways, thanks for an amazing night Cheesecake Factory in Victoria Gardens!"
Alfonso D.,"Chino, CA",2,15,,3.0,10/29/2016,Took my wife out for an early dinner. She ordered the steak Diane and Chicken Madiera. I ordered myfavorite all time dish at Cheesecake Factory is the Shrimp Bistro Pasta. My wife ordered her steak medium it was really pink. My shrimp was burned. We let our waitress know. To our surprise the took her steak and cooked it more and have me some more shrimp. I have never seen this before. By the time our reheated dishes came back everything was cold. DISAPPOINTED.
Jessica M.,"Upland, CA",60,1,,2.0,12/19/2016,"I went with my family on Friday night and I asked how long the wait is. Bradley,(white guy with a beard, thin and small), told me it would be 30 mins so we waited. We ended up waiting like an hour and a half. So I went up to him to return the buzzer and Bradley snatched it out of my hand and said wait over there. I didn't say anything I just asked for his name so I can write this review about how rude he was to me. He needs to check his attitude next time he clocks in. Food was good though."
Karen F.,"Glendora, CA",0,5,,5.0,6/20/2017,As good as this restaurant is it's a shame they don't take reservations. They suggested coming in an hour before to put our name in.  I'm going with an 85 yr old grandmother who can't sit there for an hour let alone walk around in this summer heat window shopping till they call us.  Some day they will be begging for people to make reservations.  Gee can't wait
Joe S.,"Fontana, CA",0,6,45,1.0,8/28/2016,We came to have dinner me my wife and our 3 kids .... They love the mashed potatoes and we love the  chicken madeira so after ordering and waiting about 30min for the meals finally they bring out  the meals with no mashed potato the waitress puts them On the table and says the manager will come talk to you ..the manager came 5 minutes later  and offered us something els in a rude way that i didn't like and i refused to take anything els instead of the mashed potatoes that comes with my meal because we always go there for this chicken madeira   ... U just cant bring half of my meal and say thats all what we have  after waiting 30 min that was very unprofessional from a restaurant like the cheesecake factory  .... Anyway it was a very bad experience at that restaurant and by the way i paid full price for a meal that is missing half of it

Lisa A.,"Jurupa Valley, CA",18,36,5,1.0,8/13/2016,"Not only is this place too small for such a large crowd, which reminds me of Disneyland and all of those strollers, ( yes there was an area where all these young parents parked their over large baby RV vehicles), but there were FLIES, no I'm not kidding, FLIES lots of them dive bombing my food and my husbands food too. I counted 3 flies sitting on top of my husband's bottle of sparkling water!!!!!! ARE YOU KIDDING ME???!?!?! ARE YOU READING THIS MR. MANAGER of this establishment? And they were small ones, like just  after maggot stage, SO YOU REALLY HAVE A PROBLEM DON'T YOU? Are you listening to me? We were sitting INSIDE, in the bar area and I could not finish my meal. SHAME, SHAME, SHAME on you for doing such a horrible job. I meant to only give this establishment 1 star. And thank you no, we did not order any Cheese Cake Factory  (would you like flies with that?) dessert."
Mel P.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",25,36,11,5.0,9/23/2016,"We came here for my sons 18th birthday party of 10 on a Sunday and got a table in less than 30 minutes, yes perfect! Our server was fast and gave great service, food came out fast and was delicious!! Its honestly one of our favorite restaurants in Victoria Gardens."
Genevieve D.,"Baldwin Park, CA",1,23,1,1.0,3/27/2017,"My family and I drove from San Dimas to celebrate my Mom's bday because she specifically asked to go to Cheesecake Factory for her favorite dish, garlic noodles. Unfortunately, when she ordered, our waitress, Whitney, informed that it was no longer on the menu. It was really the only reason we decided to go there in the first place. Whitney was kind enough to ask the chef if they can somehow make it but unfortunately the kitchen didn't have the ingredients. So, we ordered other items. We also ordered a bottle of wine. This was extremely disappointing because apparently the bottle was brought to our table already previously opened. When I noticed the lack of wine etiquette, Whitney said she didn't have a wine opener and had to borrow the bartender's. I don't agree with nor appreciate the lack of proper etiquette because I, myself, have been a bartender and waitress; therefore, it is simple wine etiquette that when a guest orders a bottle of wine, you present it, open it, and pour the first glass to taste. Whitney did not do any of this. Although she was nice, we felt this was a lack of customer service. All she offered was that if we were to get ANOTHER bottle that she would make sure to open it at our table. Again, dissatisfied with the response to this observation. About this time, Whitney introduced Suzy to take over. Another issue we had was when my mom got her amended order of the shrimp garlic pasta. It came with small steamed shrimp instead of grilled shrimp as she requested. Suzy was awesome. She apologized for the mistake and brought out the correct order. Overall, I don't think we will return to this location because the service has been much better at the other locations."
Ash L.,"Riverside, CA",18,28,209,3.0,4/16/2016,"It was a bit to crowded, for my boyfriend and I there was at least 20 min waiting period before we where seated. When we where seated we where in a tight space. Although the seating was tight, the proximity to another table was discouraging because you couldn't really have a private conversation without hearing the other person and the noise level was a bit above average because of the closeness of our neighbors but food was mouthwatering."
Ethel M.,"Fullerton, CA",3,12,5,1.0,3/31/2017,Friday 1pm - Horrible service waited for our food for 25-30 minutes. They were out of the crab dip. So they cancelled that But I think they cancelled our entire order by mistake that's why it took so long. Had to go to front to ask them where our food was. Waitress didn't bother to apologize. Nobody came to bus dishes from our table.
Katherine S.,"Irvine, CA",237,172,971,2.0,12/3/2014,"~$20 for one entree  ~$7-10 for 1 slice of cheesecake  Favorites:  Jambalaya pasta (a little spicy!)   Red velvet cheesecake  I got the Louisiana chicken pasta and at first bites, I was actually surprised at how good it was! There were fried pieces of chicken that greatly went along with the mild, Cajun flavored pasta. There was too much oil in the dish, and I left feeling too heavy and full though I had only eaten 1/4 of my plate (big serving sizes). Cheesecake Factory is a very mediocre restaurant in my opinion- nothing stands out about it and I'd really rather spend that $20 on other food."
Jeff H.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",1,4,2,3.0,7/30/2016,Waiter was very nice.  Good just average.  I am done eating now that the next table brought their dog.  Was not aware that animals were allowed in here.
Catherine S.,"Victorville, CA",4,31,13,5.0,10/7/2016,Service is great! Appetizers are great appearance and serving portions are perfect and delish!
Yassar F.,"Chino, CA",230,289,903,4.0,12/26/2015,"Just your typical cheese cake factory here, big, busy and noisy. Over all the service was good the food was good and the wait was not too bad when we went. I would definitely come here again."
Alan T.,"San Bernardino, CA",0,39,,5.0,4/24/2017,Outstanding food and service Came for lunch. My mother and I shared a chicken salad sandwich. More than enough for two meals. Hands down the best I ever had. The bread was crisp. The chicken salad made with obviously fresh ingredients. I had some left over and had it for lunch the next day. Still the best ever. Our server was a true professional. We will be back !
Diane K.,"Corona, CA",0,76,27,4.0,10/23/2016,The cheesecakes were great.  I ordered a couple different ones.  The spaghetti and meatball needs more sauce.  The chicken and waffles is really good.  Chiliquiles could have used more green sauce.  I could've just ate multiple cheesecakes..so good!  Love the whipped cream!
