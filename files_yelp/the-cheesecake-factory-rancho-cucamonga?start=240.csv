Mariah C.,"Chino, CA",0,8,5,5.0,2/5/2016,This was my second visit and it was great yet again. I loved the food and the staff was amazing and very attentive. Anthony was our server and was great!! Thank you CCF for a great visit!!
Carlos R.,"Fontana, CA",0,4,,2.0,5/14/2017,"The food isn't good at all it has no flavor. Cheesecakes are good, but regular food like shrimp & pasta tastes bad. I recommend going somewhere else for food."
Sandy K.,"Whittier, CA",3003,1575,9402,4.0,7/15/2013,"This Cheesecake Factory is located at the Victoria Gardens shopping district. I came in on a Friday just before happy hour was to end at 6 pm. A table was going to take time to a while so I sat at in table located in the bar. My waitress was great - friendly attentive and she even got a appetizer and a several cocktails ordered even though HH had ended. The appetizer was the Buffalo Blast which was okay BC I didn't care for the excess batter. Followed with a 1/2 order of chopped salad which was still sizable. For the main course I chose the Cajun Jambalaya pasta. The mixture of two pastas was tasty with shrimp, chicken and melody of ingredients with the exception I think would have been tastier if there was sausage in the pasta. The portion of food was large and I had plenty of leftovers. As with the Grand Lux Cafe which is part of the Cheesecake Factory - it's difficult to go wrong dinning here for a large corporate chain. The menu is large and diverse which gives lots of options."
Derek H.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",130,18,1,5.0,1/12/2016,"Had some outstanding service from Susan H, who I know was really busy, but was still able to serve our table in a timely fashion. Very much appreciated! The accidentally messed up our order, but gave us complimentary salads for the wait and made sure our order was rushed and still cooked to perfection. We come here often, and we will continue to come, thanks to Susan and the staff who know how to run a restaurant to a T!  Thanks again Susan for your service tonight on my birthday, it was very pleasant!"
Eliza B.,"Perris, CA",9,54,44,4.0,2/21/2016,"Celebrated my best friends birthday here last night. The wait was an hour, which is to be expected on a Saturday night at Victoria Gardens.  The service was outstanding! We both really liked him and wish I had gotten his name to mention here.  As for the food: They give you bread while waiting for your dinner which was yummy.  We shared the artichoke dip and it was SO delicious but they really skimped on the tortilla chips.  I had the Kobe burger (heavenly, really everyone should try it) and the baked potato soup (amazing beyond words.) My friend really enjoyed her chicken fettuccine although I feel it was overpriced ($21) but it was a large portion!  We told our server it was her birthday and that we didn't want singers or attention, just a candle and a birthday message written on the plate.  Note to everyone: Birthday cheesecake ain't free here! Only negative comment I have is the price of the alcohol. They don't have the price of the drinks on the menu for good reason! We each had two rounds of lemon drop martinis and ended up paying over $50 on drinks alone. This was completely fine with me given the special occasion but I wouldn't come here and get a drink on a regular night. Great food and service though. Would definitely come back again!"
Marissa T.,"Silver Spring, MD",23,4,,1.0,3/13/2017,"From start to end this was not a good experience. It was just my husband and I, and we sat at our table for 30 minutes before being offered drinks. The waitress was kind of short with us but got nicer towards the end (aka tipping time). The food runners kept trying to give us wrong food (forcing us even). They would take the food back to the kitchen and send another runner out with the same wrong order. This happened three times! My food wasn't good either. The pasta tasted like it was boiled hours or days prior and left out to dry - very tough. The cheesecake slices are tiny, and now cost $8 each, but this is probably what all the locations are doing now. Refills were out of the question as the waitress made herself very scarce. Yes, the restaurant was busy. I don't understand why though. I will not be back here. We were in such a hurry to get out of there that my husband didn't notice his credit card wasn't returned to him. We had to make the drive back to retrieve it. Not even an apology. This is possibly the worst Cheesecake Factory in existence."
Adan ..,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,19,22,1.0,1/11/2017,"So we have been there two times in 3 weeks. So where do I begin? We showed up 3 weeks ago and they were busy, took an hour to sit us down. So we finally get seated and they took our order. First of all plates are anywhere from $10 and up and the portions are big. My problem started when I ordered the Kobe burger, I got it medium rare and twenty minutes passed by and nothing. My waitress came and let me know that they ""ran"" out of frozen meat for my burger.... what???!! Are you freaking kidding me? Why is my 18 dollar burger made out of a frozen patty at 18 dollars a plate specially a kobe burger? Anyway the manager came and apologized, she said she would comp my dinner since my wife's food came first. 5 minutes later my waitress came and said oh I heard we don't have meat to make ur burger, I said yes manager came already and she told me. My waitress seemed to be out of the loop and the manager never talked to her about it. I ended up eating 25 minutes after my wife so it kinda ruined date night. Today we went again because we got a bunch of giftcards for the place and my wife loves the food. Today we showed up and there was no one really there but still took 5 minutes to sit us and they sat someone before us who showed up literally 4 minutes after us all the hosted said was whoops you guys were here first right? I didn't even bothered and went along with it. We sat down and ordered, my wife's food was cold so she asked if they can reheat it for her, she took the plate back but once again it was another example of us eating separately. We flagged another waitress and asked for ours only to find out that "" our waitress"" was out on break but no one bothered tell us that she was going on break and someone else would help us. We never had our drinks refilled and I am tired of this place. They don't care about you the consumer but have no problem trying to up sell you on stuff! This was our date night again and it was ruined by poor service again. I will be contacting corporate and complaining! Dinner for two without drinks was 45 dollars and the food was cold and not even an apology! Save ur money and go somewhere else, I'm very disappointed and I'm sure no one will even bother contacting us!"
kevin t.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",47,26,31,4.0,9/25/2016,"Just had the Shepard's Pie. It was better than any Shepard's Pie I've ever had. Unfortunately, I have to go to McDonald's to get full. Small dinky portion. Won't be coming back. Ask for bread..have 4 in your party, they give you 3 pieces of bread. Ask for more iced tea.. 35 minutes later..ask again. This Cheesecake Factory is in Victoria Gardens. I was going to sop up my leftover gravy with my bread..they took my plate, they took my bread. Holy Crap..really? Yeah not impressed."
Michael U.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",461,2,2,1.0,10/8/2015,"i ordered the southwest chicken sandwich to-go and requested no avocado. as soon as i said 'no avocado' the girl working at the bakery made sure to let me know that the sandwich does not come with avocado... even though i know for a fact that it specifically says so on the menu. anyways, i received the sandwich and took it home, only to bite into it and realize that there was indeed avocado... even though i specifically told them not, and they specifically assured me that the sandwich does not come with avocado.  returned a few days later and ordered the same thing. was told again by a different person that there was no avocado. i tried to explain what happened last time and they told me ""WELL YOU MUST NOT HAVE HAD THIS SANDWICH"". I had no idea the cheese cake factory had such a passion for putting avocado on peoples sandwiches. eventually she realizes that's she's completely wrong and says 'oh, there's guac..."" as if the main ingredient in guac isn't avocado.  i tell my sister about this incident and she calls the managers to complain to them, because clearly this is not ok. the manager agrees, and promises to send us 'gift cards', note that he specifically said cards, plural. of course it took 3 weeks to arrive, and when it gets here... a whopping $15 gift card is all mine. i feel lied to, and like they really don't care about what happened at al. the sandwich after tax is over $15, and to top it off, i had 2 bad situations over this sandwich. after i use this $15 gift card (plus whatever extra i'll have to pay for my meal) i'll make it a pact to never come back again(i'll go to the pasadena location instead). the yard house is a way better option for me, better service, and cheaper prices"
Sandra L.,"Victorville, CA",2,26,39,5.0,3/23/2016,"We really love the food here.  We always have to wait, but it is well worth the wait.  My step son told me this is his favorite place to come, so we don't come here unless he is with us.  They have salted carmel  cheesecake that some would say is to die for!!"
Megan M.,"Claremont, CA",0,5,1,3.0,4/7/2017,"food was really good here but the service was absolutely terrible, i was on the verge of just leaving without paying because i waited for an hour after my meal to get the check after i asked multiple times for it. Also they thought i was lying about my friends birthday and left in the middle of singing?? Really just rude people. Pepperoni was salty as well."
Reggie L.,"Country Club Hills, IL",0,14,1,1.0,11/21/2015,"Every time .. Someone says lets go to Cheesecake Factory .. I say OMG !! I am gonna get treated like .. Cramp !! And again a broken table , dirty dish with my food on it .. And a waitress that has no respect for customers .."
Autum R.,"San Bernardino, CA",74,23,16,2.0,10/2/2016,"My boyfriend and I have been here plenty of times but it was for the cheesecake , which is always amazing . The cheesecake alone deserves 5+ stars . But their food/servers is what is giving this place a 2- . We went on a surprise date hoping for a good meal and that is not what we got . My food was decent but greasy . It was something with shrimp and pasta and it was lemony . He requested a special order and when it was delivered it tastes and looked like bland spaghetti. I told him we were not about to pay $30 for that so he returned it and order the crab cakes instead which were another disappointment. There was more garnish on the plate then there was crab cakes. And to top that off the crab cakes were mushy and undercooked . Our server wasn't attentive at all and went missing most of the time . My boyfriend had to get up and go find her just to have a pink lemonade refilled. It was a horrible night and if it Were not for his great company , I wouldn't have enjoyed myself. He left her a hefty $30 tip for a $50 meal and I felt she didn't even deserve $5."
Dion T.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",95,45,154,5.0,2/28/2016,"This is my 2nd home lol.. Great service, food, ambience.. Great menu with Alot of choices with great prices. I cant say enough good things about this place. Just be prepared to wait awhile to be seated, they stay busy and deservedly so.."
Tara M.,"Long Beach, CA",188,10,8,4.0,2/27/2016,"Great lunch with my mom today... Waited five min for patio seating on a gorgeous California day. Waiter was super cute!!!! But he was also attentive and polite. Food was delicious today. My cocktail though, wasn't what I expected. But, I'm not one to return a drink. Oh! And the Salted Caramel Cheesecake was amazing!!!"
Anisah H.,"Manhattan, NY",20,298,358,1.0,9/22/2015,"This is our fourth visit to this particular location and it was pretty bad. It had been quite a length of time between visits so I am assuming there may be new chefs employed who haven't been there long enough to have the massive menu memorized. But of course a quick look would tell you exactly what each dish should entail. I ordered a fairly simple pasta dish and recieved some random concoction that I am positive isn't even on the menu. My sauce wasn't right, three ingredients were missing and the pasta to sauce ratio was 4:1. The original cheesecake with strawberries was ok, I'd rather have fresh strawberries without the glaze. The glaze wasn't for me."
Crystal C.,"Ontario, CA",3,12,3,2.0,5/6/2016,"Three of us as guests were told a 30 minute wait time.  After over a half hour of waiting we checked to see how much longer the wait was and we were told we would be next. About 20 minutes after that, same response. Well, after seeing so many people get seated before us we asked again to see what the problem was and the manager only began to argue saying we could sit outside then. It was cold and raining and to top it off I'm pregnant. We had waited over an hour only for him to finally seat us in a section that had several empty tables.  Feeling very nauseous at this point we asked for bread after sitting for a few minutes in our booth and were told it was in the oven... It came to us cold, so I'm not sure what that was all about.  The manager never apologized or offered anything in return for our poor service with him and the hostess.  Despite all of this, the food was delicious and the servers were kind, but don't ever trust their wait time."
John G.,"Hollywood, CA",742,240,468,5.0,1/19/2015,"Of course I'll be another one to write a review about this place.. Ok, so I went for a late dinner around 7:30ish and there were a ton of people waiting inside and outside.. Nervous right!! Long wait possibly !! Ugh!  So I put my name down (party of 2 please) and was given an estimated time and the hostess told me 20-25min, not bad considering the amount of people that were already ahead of me. But,, (good news) she was spot on, I think about 22min passed (I know, I'm a stickler for time) and our table was ready..  During the waiting time for our table, I checked out the menu (over bearing.. Options, options, options) and I highly recommend doing this at any restaurant (so when ur server first comes to you, your ready to order).. I ordered the chicken Madeira and the steak Diane with sautéed asparagus and mashed potatoes (hold the butter).. And a nice wine mushroom reduction sauce on my proteins. Medium on my steak please.. Of course I ordered an app.. Avocado egg rolls (to die for).. With a sweet dipping sauce (yumm) and they don't skip out on the avocado inside (massive amounts ).. And during the wait for our dinner,, of course complimentary bread and butter was given (oh no,, double time at the gym, carbs carbs carbs).  As our food came out, my dinner looked amazing.. Nicely presented .. But one little issue,, my steak was medium well (almost to well done) .. So I sent it back (aggravated,, no not me,, I mean it happens) just be patient.. Finally I got my correct temp on my steak.. So juicy and the chicken so moist and the reduction sauce (flavorful).. Also, we ordered a kahlua coffee cheesecake.. AmAzing taste for coffee lovers.. Wasn't to overbearing and wasn't to sweet at all.. Just right  finally I got the bill and surprisingly for what I and my friend order with drinks $69 not bad..  Highly satisfied and would definitely come back"
Maria M.,"Beaumont, CA",98,160,781,4.0,7/25/2016,"The wait on a weekend is about 15-20 at lunch time,  towards dinner time it's about 30 mins. The salads are good and so are the pastas ! The  cheese cake  is amazing with many flavors and varieties  to choose from . The service  is on point nice staff ! Finding a parking space on the weekend  can be tough ! Follow the people walking towards their car and ask them if they are leaving that's the best bet ! Otherwise you'll  be looking for a while !"
Leena H.,"Los Angeles, CA",41,33,19,3.0,1/31/2016,Still love their place. One of faves is the chicken Marsala. Waiting time to be seated can take long at times so arrive anticipating to wait a while unless you go really early or really late. The waiter looked tired and didn't want to make second trip for our order of fries when There were two that had been ordered a side for order and he said it was actually a double order put together I said no it's not its one order and my daughter had a separate order which came separately.  he knew I noticed he was lying to me about that in order to avoid his second trip to the kitchen but he quickly corrected it by grabbing us our order of fries and bringing them out.  I know it's hard to sometimes keep a smile but when a customer walks in they are paying for expensive meals so the appropriate thing to do is to be more courteous and smile more be appreciative that we are there as customers and paying a pretty penny for our dinners. We go there because it's dining and entertainment.  people already have tough days and go there to enjoy a nice dinner and relax with family or what not. Make their visit a pleasant one. At least for the hour they are there then you can vent your frustrations once the visit is over.  I would've left a higher tip had he simply smiled and made us feel more welcomed instead of looking forced. Customer service matters a lot when you arrive at a restaurant you really like and tell a lot of people about. Especially now with social media.  I'd like to mention that the environment is still nice and located at VGs which is always good because you can walk around after or before a meal if the weather is pleasant that day/night. What can I say it's still one of my favorite restaurants and would've given it a 5 had the customer service Been better and the hostess not forgotten about seating us a lot later than what we were suppose to wait. 10 mins turned into 30 and it was 1030pm   And forgotten.
