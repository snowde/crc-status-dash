Heather P.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",103,144,78,4.0,8/1/2016,The cheesecake is always bomb. We came in for the national cheesecake day half off cheesecake. Shared a club sandwich so we would have room for cheesecake. Never disappointed when I go here.
Chanese H.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",13,61,91,4.0,1/24/2015,Came in here on a Friday night. Around 10:30ish. Was surprised that there was only a 10-15 minute wait. We honestly probably waited for 8 minutes. Which was nice.  One thing I hate about the place is the menu. Do you seriously need that many pages and that many advertisements. There are wayyyyy too many choices Which always makes it that much harder to pick something to try. After flipping threw the menu for what felt like 10 minutes I finally found the drink page. Something that stood out to me was the Strawberry Creamsicle. It's like a strawberry shake with alcohol. It was alright. In my opinion not worth $11 I wanted to be different and try something that I normally wouldn't get so I ordered the Macaroni and Cheeseburger. The waitress said that it's super cheesy and good. Well I like cheese so I was extremely excited to get it. But unfortunately super cheesy it wasn't. It just tasted like a cheeseburger. The macaroni was forgettable. I Was disappointed with it. Especially because it cost me $12.  On a good note our waitress was great and the snickers cheesecake is amazing.  I'll be back but I will be trying something different
Janet J.,"San Bernardino, CA",49,9,1,3.0,11/12/2015,I called in take out on 11.11 for my parents anniversary. (they dont go out much since they are old lol ) i ordered two of the chicken little dinners and a slice of fresh strawberry cheese cake . i live 30 mins away and my order was ready when i arrived :).  I paid for and recieved my order with no problem.. It was not until i got home that i found out that 90% of the chicken was burnt. My parents couldnt even eat it. I ended up giving it to my dog :( and getting them something from somewhere quick. I have always loved eating at this location but not sure if i will come back after thisn incident. I gave it 3 stars because of my past positive experiences ive had here.
Mike M.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",31,58,17,1.0,8/11/2015,"3 Strikes & your out. This used to be a good Cheesecake Factory & slowly has degraded. 1,) served cold food 2.) next visit bad server. Was more interested in talking to other employees than pay attention to us 3.) Tonight had chicken tacos & rice & beans were cold. Really cold, not even a little warm. Manager worthless. In fact in all cases it's the manager. He is responsible for his staff. We live just up the street & I don't expect to try again. Been coming here for 10 years & it just went to crap here. Fortunately we have so many other choices. #victoriagardens"
Randy S.,"Glendora, CA",2,9,1,3.0,10/4/2015,"Had a nice lunch here today. The service was pretty efficient and the wait staff were pleasant, the food was fine. Not so sure I'd ever go back, though,  for the minuscule taste of cheesecake that they are serving up these days.  We got a couple slices to go and were shocked by how small they were when we went to refrigerate them. Never thought we'd have to go somewhere else for dessert when eating at the Cheesecake Factory!"
Andrea B.,"Sun City, CA",1,2,,1.0,5/8/2016,"We waited an hour to get our table. We got a really nice waiter but when our food came 3 of our 5 meals were just wrong. Undercooked pasta on 2, and an avocado toast that was just skimped on so much that it looked like the avocado had been licked off. We spoke to the manager who brought out more avocado and took our pasta dishes back to get new pasta. Round 2 we get our plates back with Undercooked pasta AGAIN. The manager wanted to give us a piece of cheesecake and didn't want to comp us on our meals. He said that because we ate some of it that we should pay for it. He even questioned one of us on how much we ate even though I had the waiter take my plate away. HORRIBLE service from the manager! Our waiter was good but that's about it. When I wait an hour for a seat and pay good money for a meal I expect better customer service and food. We will never return to this location again."
XO X.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",38,208,16,5.0,9/3/2016,Had the BEST experience last night! Got here around 7:30pm on a Friday night and it was packed. We got super lucky and found a seat at the bar (our favorite place to sit) and got our drinks right away. I ordered the Rib Eye Steak and my husband got some Spicy chicken pasta. Needless to say it was the BEST meal. I decided to switch it up instead of the regular burger or chicken de pana (also very good) and I'm SO happy I did. Even though it was kinda pricier than the other options it was AMAZING! Seriously the best mouthwatering perfectly cooked steak I've had! I really don't mind spending the extra $$ on the steak. The bar guys were awsome as well!
Greg F.,"Chino, CA",3216,370,3524,4.0,10/14/2013,"Good things are happening at the Cheesecake Factory in Rancho Cucamonga.  It was a beautiful, sunny day, and the outdoor patio was calling my name.  We decided to patronize The Factory of Cheesecake and enjoy the weather at the same time. My wife and I had the crusted chicken with mashed potatoes and pasta (lunch special menu hooray).  We also had our fill of the bread that is included.  Go slow with the bread because it will explode in your stomach.   Our meals and the bread were excellent.  Our waitress was also very good, and she ensured that my glass of iced tea was never empty.  I was excited to order a slice of vanilla bean cheesecake, but you guessed it.....the bread exploded in my stomach and there was no room left at inn!"
Hubznwifey 1.,"Camarillo, CA",38,30,15,1.0,9/1/2016,"Not good service from Alex, she was very slow. But we love Cheesecake factory so well definitely be back soon."
Joy R.,"Seal Beach, CA",10,113,346,5.0,12/14/2014,Shout out of gratitude tonight to Cassandra & Cameron for taking care of my elderly parents & I tonight!!! My parents don't get out to often because of their handicaps so the extra special attention you paid them was so much appreciated. Thank you both for the 5-STAR service & hospitality!!! AS for food...Ahi tuna carpacchio is DA BOMB!!! A must have for tuna poke lover's out there. This deconstructed version of our Hawaiian Island favorite is BRILLIANT!!! Table went with the ORIGINAL cheesecake w/strawberries for dessert...AWESOME!!  Parking is a bit of a challenge at this location but WORTH it!!!
Randall S.,"Ontario, CA",1,27,3,3.0,8/10/2016,"Went on a Wednesday to celebrate my sister's birthday.  The service was really slow.  I'd hate to eat here on a weekend.  Can't blame the waitress -- who was really nice-- because she doesn't make the food.  Other than that, the food was good but nothing exceptional (I had the Cajun pasta). We ordered dessert but it took almost 25 minutes to bring it.  When it arrived we just asked for the bill because we had already spent 1 1/2 hours at this place.  I've been to other Cheesecake Factory locations in LA and Brea and service was much better."
Derek S.,"Lincoln, NE",23,37,1,5.0,8/10/2016,Everything we ordered from the Louisiana Chicken to the kids noodles was excellent. The staff was quick with refills and recommended some great cheesecake options we hadn't tried before.
Maria A.,"Huntington Beach, CA",69,43,185,4.0,8/26/2015,Great food great service  except for a toothpick in my sandwich and bit into it And stabbed my mouth ouch. The waitress said that they hold them together and then pull them out but part of it got stuck :( Lucky for them It didn't do worth of damage?
Wayne F.,"Gardena, CA",15,1,,1.0,5/21/2016,"This has to be the worst Cheesecake Factor on earth.  The hostess, was so rude that I thought of leaving and grabbing a burger. When you have a large party  they should give you a reasonable wait time, not 3 hrs. The staff wasn't helping in regards to our wait, nor was management. If I could give this place a negative rating, I would. This place eats SHIT!"
Chris M.,"Glendora, CA",0,3,,1.0,6/8/2016,"Rudest server I've ever had in my life. Literally grabbed the pen from my hand as I was finishing writing the tip & signature on the bill.  Manager gives the typical ""I will talk to her."" I asked the manager, ""do you know which serve to talk to?""...She responded, ""well there are 4 waitresses in the area you were sitting at."" She didn't know which one.  I understand why her staff acts that way now. Never going back."
Eddie N' Hailee S.,"Running Springs, CA",20,136,22,4.0,8/21/2016,We love the Cheesecake Factory! We always have to get the fried mac n cheese for an appetizer and always need Chris' Outrageous Cheesecake for dessert. Fill in a entree in the middle which are almost always great for an awesome meal. The downside to this place is the location which causes it to be very crowded at times.
Aggie J.,"Upland, CA",16,17,1,2.0,7/3/2015,"Been to a few Cheesecake Factories before and this one was nice. The ambience is good. Noisy but it's ok.  The wait time was about 10 mins and that was fair considering it was the beginning of dinner service. Our server, don't know her name, was ok.  She was professional but a tad patronizing. I ordered a Cuban Sandwich and my partner ordered Louisiana Pasta.  My Cuban sandwich was horrendous. It was really large and the bread was burnt and extremely crunchy. They left it on their grill or panini press way too long. It was drenched with oil and too much mustard  My mouth is numb.  The Louisiana Pasta was supposed to have a creamy New Orleans sauce but they were either short on sauce or forgot to put on the plate. The bow tie pasta was swimming in oil. Rather nasty. Didn't even finish it.  There are two good things, their cheesecake is wonderful. It was perfect and it melts in your mouth. The vanilla shakes are also very good. Those are the two reasons why they are receiving two stars otherwise I'd rate it 1 start."
Trent S.,"Victorville, CA",20,32,23,2.0,8/14/2016,We came her for our 10th wedding anniversary.  We ordered our food. My wife ordered the chicken Salad sandwich.  I ordered the avocado toast. It took over an hour to get our food after we ordered and at 2:15 in the afternoon  they were not to busy. Finely our waitress Alexandria  came back  and asked what we ordered again.  So we told her and another 20 min passed before we received our food. It was not like we ordered anything hard to cook. Matter of fact no cooking was involved in what we ordered. Our waitress knew we had been there  that long and not even so much as an apology.  #WhatEverHappenedToCustomerService.
Swan S.,"Las Vegas, NV",330,183,624,1.0,3/26/2016,"For a cheesecake factory, this one is the absolute pits. I've been twice and have been disgusted by how poorly prepared the food has been both times. This visit I had some alleged pomodoro pasta which was supposed to be vegan and no cheese....even after asking several times in a number of different ways, I'm still suspect of the sauce. The Management is sorry. My service both times was mediocre. This time my server stopped in the midst of taking my order to tell me she had to go and greet another table that just sat down (smdh). After leaving mid sentence, she finally comes back and finishes taking my order. She knew nothing about the food on the menu. And she was short and impatient with answering questions. I still gave her a 15% tip because I may have to come back on another business trip with guests and did not want to leave any bad energy behind. It will not be my choice. But if my guests want to go, we will....I doubt if I will order anything for a third time. I also had a side of disgusting spinach which was microwaved to keep it warm....because the plate was hot and the food was cold. Again, disgusting."
Jordan A.,"Albuquerque, NM",19,46,,2.0,5/29/2015,"The only reason this is two stars instead of one is because the slice of cheesecake I ordered was the best thing I've ever had.  For starters, we got in there and they said the wait would be about 30-45 minutes. No big deal, we were visiting from a state that doesn't have a Cheesecake Factory and I was willing to wait. After about 30 minutes, our buzzer went off. Yay!  Not yay. We gave them our buzzer and they said to stand in this other area and our name would be called shortly. From what I could tell, they'd print off a sheet of paper with our name and table number on it, then take us to the table. We waited 15 minutes in line, with other parties that had 4-6 people in them being called ahead of us. Then they called the party of 2 that was in front of me and my fiance, so I was hopeful we'd be next. Nope, another five minutes of them calling everyone except us. I finally lost my patience and went to the host desk and said ""Excuse me, but what was the point of buzzing us up here if you're going to make us wait another 20 minutes for a table?"" There was a man that was probably a manager standing up there, and he took me and my fiance to a table immediately after that remark.  Our server was just as bad. Her section included a table of what was either her friends or fellow employees, and she spent her time sitting with them and laughing, with my fiance and I she was quite cold. Not rude, just not friendly and not overly helpful. I'm willing to bet the manager told her about my losing my patience and she assumed that I was going to continue being rude, which stinks for her. I ordered the Lingurian pesto pasta, and the type of pasta had changed and the chicken I added to it had just been haphazardly tossed on top of the bowl of pasta. My fiance had a pizza that was relatively decent.  My Oreo Dream Extreme Cheesecake was to die for though. I still think about how wonderful it was."
