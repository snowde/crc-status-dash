Lindsay N.,"Fontana, CA",9,13,,1.0,7/15/2016,"Got the Skinny Chopped Salad...was decent but nothing special. Waitress spilled Vinaigrette all over my purse, brought a wet rag to help clean it but was disappointed she didn't offer to make it up to us. Ruined part of the zipper! Was also very disappointed the manager did not come over to apologize. Could have offered dessert or something to make up for it. Apparently you have to cause a BIG scene in order for people to do what is right."
Sil T.,"Crestline, CA",1,36,20,5.0,7/15/2016,Went around 11:30. We were seated quickly. My wife and I both had salads. The food was excellent and the waitress was one of the best ever. She was very professional and pleasant. Great experience.
Kayla M.,"Big Bear, CA",0,9,,2.0,7/22/2017,"Very disappointed on how this facility is being run. I used to consider this restaurant as an ""special occasion"" place to eat. Tonight my husband and I decided to make it such a night. The wait wasn't horrible (40min) but when you wait that time, get called in stating your table is ready, then are told to wait again for someone to seat you (10 more min) is poor management. This was the practice for every customer. Once seated the waitress was very friendly but stated they were behind on the orders for bread. Ok, it's busy, I can deal with that. When the food finally came the server didn't know what table to bring it to. I had to flag him down stating that was our order. To top it all off, my Chinese chicken salad was chicken less. They offered to bring me out a piece of ""already cooked"" chicken from the back and since it had been sitting back there pre cooked it would take a min. At this point I was over the entire experience and very disappointed from what should have been a nice evening out to dinner. What has happened to our ""good restaurants""? Is this a case of pure laziness?"
Ryan E.,"Long Beach, CA",0,30,3,2.0,1/8/2017,"The atmosphere is good. The food is ok. When walking, please be careful. That restaurant needs a deep scrubbing. You can slip and slide your way to your seat; the floor is covered in grease."
Daniel E.,"Redlands, CA",85,10,2,4.0,2/11/2017,"I liked the atmosphere, it was dimly lit and somewhat romantic if you wanted to bring someone on a date, I was with my girlfriend and her family. We were seated outside which was nice since they had heaters by the tables to keep the guests warm, it was raining too so it was nice to have that background sound, I love the rain. The waitress took our drink orders and disappeared into the chaos of the restaurant. It was extremely busy that night! It took probably 15-20 minutes for her to return, on account of how busy it was I'm sure. I ordered the macaroni and cheese burger with a Cesar salad. The waitress took the rest of the parties orders, I believe there were about twelve of us, and then again disappeared for about another 15 minutes. She came back gave us our refills and was very sweet. Soon the food came and the burger was absolutely delicious! Had some fresh tomato and pickles on it and shredded lettuce! Wow! The fryer macaroni and cheese ball on top of the patty exploded with AMAZINGNESS! That's totally a word right?"
Alura W.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",4,27,16,1.0,5/31/2015,"Our server was hardly around. We noticed he had tables both inside (near the kitchen) and outside (near the entrance)...whoever made this service plan is an idiot because it not only isn't efficient but it makes the customers receive poor service. The chicken Alfredo we ordered was bland and sent back. The pasta carbonara has a very strange after taste. The only kind of decent food we had was the chicken littles. I'll keep coming for cheesecake, but anything else isn't really worth it.  Also, I really hope the menus are cleaned or sanitized between customers since the hosts just throw them down on the napkins we use to wipe our mouths, the plates that hold our food we consume, and all the silverware we put in our mouths. I didn't see any cleaning during my visit so I guess I'll just have to hope it happens in the back? Hmmm."
Marvyn G.,"Ontario, CA",0,7,15,1.0,2/7/2017,"This place is overrated for sure. I could see they tried to make it a ""high end"" restaurant. Food is just ok. Hit or miss. I just come here because I live across the street. Long wait time, especially if you're ordering take out. Biggest deal breaker would be no dogs allow in the out door seating. Had to tied my dog outside the metal fence. Yard house, CPK and all the other restaurants in the Victoria gardens allow dogs in the outdoor seating..."
Jessie D.,"Anaheim, CA",49,67,40,5.0,9/26/2015,"Great customer service! We expected to have to wait long since we went on a Friday night, but was pleasantly surprised when we were seated within 5 minutes. The drinks were great and sized appropriately. Portions for food are BIG, but delicious. Overall we had a great experience and left full."
Tiffany H.,"Apple Valley, CA",11,53,26,5.0,9/23/2015,Always have a great experience. Sometimes the wait is long but it's worth it. The servers are attentive and friendly. I like how they have different types of food from Asian to Mexican. They have the best guacamole and their Smores Cheesecake is so good. I would go back just for the guacamole!
Cergio U.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,7,5,1.0,4/7/2015,This location served me a pasta with a staple hidden inside the food. When they made me another plate it had chicken hidden under the cheese & pasta. I don't eat meat & I didn't like the fact that they made me pay the bill. The managers name is Gabriel Navarrete would some please tell this guy how a restaurant is suppose to be run. I also had my drink spilled on me & I had to clean it up myself. Don't eat here! Warning!
Cherry C.,"Claremont, CA",343,228,364,5.0,4/28/2015,"The service is always top notch, it's always clean and the chicken Bellagio is amazing!"
Peter and Jolie H.,"Los Angeles, CA",8,112,28,2.0,5/12/2016,"We came in for lunch on a Thursday at 1:08.  It took them 15 minutes to come by and take our order.  After they took our order,  they didn't come by again until the food came out another 35 minutes later and it was only the appetizer.   Service was pretty bad"
Gina M.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",228,7,,5.0,7/5/2016,"Had lunch here last week.  I ordered the gumbo, with no shrimp but they accidentally added it anyway.  The manager came to the table and told me the wait would be longer because the chef had to remake my order.  She offered me a slice of cheesecake (my flavor of choice) as an apology for the extended wait.  I appreciate the great customer service of the manager (young pregnant lady) & the waitress."
Beatrice S.,"San Bernardino, CA",0,5,,1.0,1/1/2017,"Went to have lunch at 2pm with family didn't get seated till about almost 3 hours later then we didn't get our bread till about half an hour later. Everyone around us was seated got their drinks bread and food way quicker and Then we ordered our food and we didn't get it till about another half an hour. The people who had been seated after us were already done eating and leaving. We asked to see a manager and all she had to say was sorry and left. I would have thought she would at least give us a small price off of our bill since it was 9 of us but we didn't get anything, the manager never even came back to apologize again or something and the waitress seemed to be bothered and didn't really want to ask if we needed refills or anything. This was the worse experience I had there. Wasn't my first time there the times I've went had a great time but this time was just bad. Spent pretty much my whole day there for food that wasn't even good. Also had three hungry kids who were just not having it and never got their apple juice refills that I had asked two times for."
Jasmine-Joy T.,"Moreno Valley, CA",21,24,9,1.0,11/11/2016,"Planned a small graduation dinner for my friend this past Thursday night, there were 8 of us. We wait for 15-20 mins(not bad compared to Yard House that night), we find our seats and it's a booth with an extra chair at the end. The seating was uncomfortable because we were basically sitting on top of each other. The waiter took our drinks and 20 mins later he finally brings our drinks(the only thing we ordered was water with lemon). We finally order a few drinks from the bar and it literally took another 20 mins for him to bring our drinks and my drink was wrong. We ordered our food and the food comes roughly 30 mins later, the food was ok. Let's just say, the customer service that night was horrible, we had to call another wait over to ask for our checks, and I'm not sure if it was the manager but he kept hawking our table the whole night we were there. I'm not sure if it was because we were a mixed group or we just looked good that night but it was uncomfortable to eat while we were being watched. I will not be coming back to THIS Cheesecake Factory."
Jenna S.,"North Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA",352,188,20,5.0,7/23/2015,"I do love the Cheesecake Factory and as far as chain restaurants go, it's definitely one of my favorites! Last time I ordered one of their salads, switched out the blue cheese crumbles for goat cheese and enjoyed this little slice of heaven! Their passion iced tea is great and does fine without any sugar added which is a major plus!  Cheesecake!!! The red velvet is amazing...so decadent, sweet and smoothe my favorite!!!"
Cosette Y.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",3,26,12,5.0,7/13/2016,This restaurant is so absolutely amazing that in the 10 times I have been here u have never found a flaw. They are always super helpful and when they mess up (on occasion ) they quickly fix it. Definitely a great place to go.
Brandon G.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",26,17,21,5.0,9/18/2015,"Great customer service. Had waitress Amber. She was very nice, catering and warm. Really makes you feel welcome. Entire staff has great customer experience and professional.  Food is awesome! Compliments to the chef!"
Grace G.,"Los Angeles, CA",206,160,177,3.0,4/1/2014,"The wait time was about an hour which was expected because we had a party of 13 but I was so annoyed because of some large parties that were there forever just sitting there not being considerate of people wanting to eat like helllllller get outta here! You've finished eating and you're just waiting for your food too digest or what? Geez! The host or whatever was seriously clueless and lacked customer service skills because he never handed me those beeper things that alert you when your table is ready all he told me was ""a manager will be here shortly to discuss your estimated wait time"" 10 minutes later no manager?  WTF so I had to give him the stink eye and ask for a beeper thing because clearly no one was coming.  I feel like the food portions are getting smaller and the prices are redonkilous now!!!! When were the prices this expensive for the Cheesecake Factory?????  Oh and my margarita was blegh! Food was tasty like always but I just wish I had more than like 3 pieces of shrimp and a bigger piece of salmon lol I'm a pretty small girl but seriously?..... I need more than that pathetic excuse for a decent sized meal."
C L.,"Ontario, CA",2,47,14,4.0,10/13/2015,Forgot what I ordered but got chicken+pasta and it was cheesy which is good. Love the cheesecake here. Got the macadamia one but liked the original better. Nice atmosphere since it's always busy and its at VG's. It's cool inside and the lights are dimmed. A star for de fanciness
