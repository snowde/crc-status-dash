angel g.,"Montclair, CA",0,11,7,1.0,4/15/2015,Yuck! Not coming back here anymore.. Found what looks like pubic hair on the bill. I'm glad it's not on our food but still.. Told the manager and all she had to say was I promise you it's not pubic hair and it's just regular hair  no apology. No wonder this Resto has only 3 stars but With 4 star prices. (Please see picture of so called hair) I have no say on the food anymore coz it's just ruined
Stephanie D.,"Glendora, CA",196,70,112,5.0,2/22/2016,"Carpaccio amazing! Cheese balls great but it's a lot for two, stay to the small plates for appetizers if you want to get an entree. They do have blue cheese stuffed olives which is definitely a plus! Overall great location and service was exceptional, even when busy bartender Heather was friendly, professional, and fast to anticipate our needs! We will definitely be back to see her"
Paulina A.,"Spokane, WA",901,337,467,4.0,6/12/2014,"Delicious cheesecakes. Cookie dough is my favorite. Raspberry and all chocolate cakes are amazing. Beautiful ambiance inside for a light night dessert date or evening with family, friends, or colleagues. Servers are friendly and welcomming. Food is alright here and a bit over priced. I highly recommend this place for a late night dessert date."
Denyse H.,"La Verne, CA",68,10,9,3.0,6/30/2016,"Everytime I come here I am disappointed with either the food or the service. Today it was hair in the food, and a chipped cocktail glass. And there were no prices on the cocktail menu. I come with friends once, twice at the most, a year. I'll join them again, but will stick to bread and water."

Monica F.,"Big Bear, CA",0,2,1,1.0,9/19/2016,"We had the worst experience at this location  yesterday September 18, 2016.  We arrived at 3pm party of 11 for my daughters Birthday. We knew we'd have a wait since Sundays are usually busy at any resturant. I checked in and received a buzzer and was told an hour wait. Ok, we waited patiently, after and hour and 10 min passed I go to the he front counter and ask where I was on the list to get a table. I was told they were waiting for that table and the hostess pointed to a table full of people and said they have already paid we are waiting for them to leave. I sat and we waited longer, now an hour and a half wait I look at the table the hosted pointed to and no one has left. I ask again when will we be seated a different hostess tells me the same about waiting for the same table to leave. I let her know I was told that 20 minutes ago and no one has left. They bring a manager to speak to me since I was a ""party of more than 8"" she tries to tell me the same about waiting for the table to clear., I asked her  isn't there anywhere else, I've been told for 35min now that table is leaving and they haven't moved we've waited now overv1 and 1/2 hours. She says she'll see what comes up next that'll fit us. With in 10 min my buzzer goes off and we are seated (not at the table they kept pointing to). Also during our wait early on we ordered a  whole 7inch cheesecake from the cheesecake counter to celebrate my daughters birthday with. The lady at the counter says all their whole cakes are frozen and it will take 30 min to defrost. I told her that was ok, we haven't even been seated yet and that we wanted it after our meal, I paid $28 and change for a whole cheesecake and a white chocolate Happy Birthday plaque. We finally sit and we inform our waiter Cole M. That we ordered a whole cheesecake from the front counter and want it after we eat, he is aware. Cole M. was a great server and was very attentive with our drinks and needs. When it came time for our cheesecake, Cole went to get it from the front counter. He came back and apologized that our cheesecake was still completely frozen. I couldn't believe this since I had ordered it at least 2 1/2 hours ago. I took my receipt to the cheesecake counter and spoke to the lady who rung me up, she claims she took it out as soon as I ordered it, I explained to her it is still completely frozen and there is no way we can cut into it, she offered to cut it for us, I got the cheesecake and brought it to her, she says she'd have our waiter bring it to us once it's cut. 10 min later our waiter comes and apologizes for them not taking it out to thaw and they currently have my cake sitting on the expresso machine to help it thaw faster. Another 10min pass and our waiter brings out our slices of cheesecake again apologizing. This was the worst experience I have had at any cheesecake factory and by the time we left after being there for over 3 hours, I was to exhausted to even find a manager to speak to. I do give credit to our waiter Cole M, he was the best thing of the whole night, everything else was horrible."
Anissa Y.,"Norwalk, CA",29,44,11,2.0,5/2/2016,"Went here for a late night dessert and most of the items we ordered were out of stock, so no strawberry shortcake, no brownies and no eggplant parmigiana with pesto.  This was a kitchen management fail.  At least our server was nice."
Veronica B.,"Pomona, CA",120,161,66,1.0,2/5/2015,"Mediocre at best. I have never been to this resturant and have heard good things.  The hostess was very sweet and gave me a table quickly, the waiter was flighty and all over the place. Took FOREVER, barely refilled drinks. My grandma got fish tacos, I got pizza, and my grandpa got a turkey club. My pizza was boring, my grandma barely touched her tacos the fish was weird tasting, and my grandpa barely ate his sandwich. But eh, cool atmosphere I guess..better off going to chilis. The waiter wasn't too bad but customer service kinda sucked, my grandpa only had 20's and a giftcard so he expected some change back. He was gonna tip just not $18 dollars, the waiter really was like ""oh no change right?"" Like ummm awkward I hate when waiters/waitresss assume. Just bring the change back or ask if they would like change, don't assume you're getting a huge tip when you barely tended the table.  It was so awkward we just let him have it whatever. Won't go back."
Janay F.,"Fontana, CA",10,26,55,1.0,4/14/2016,"Sat in the bar area and the only person that came up to me was the greeter and she brought me water when I first got there. Extremely dirty? Do you guys not have bussers or require your bartenders to buss the bar area?  Bartenders just looked at me, no server or anyone ever came. Horrible service, won't be back"
C S.,"Pomona, CA",3,23,19,5.0,5/27/2016,This Location Is Fantastic We Went In To Celebrate My Cousins Bday ..& Sat Outside Since It Was Many Of Us .. Sometimes It's Kinda Sketchy Sitting Outside Because They Like Neglect You.. But On The Contrary The Waitress Was Really Helpful.. On Point With Everything... Our Appetizers Came Out Fast.. Then Followed Our Food Which Was Amazing.. They Let The Birthday Boy Pick Out The Cheesecake He Wanted At The End.. The Whole Night Was Amazing If Your Near By Rancho Cucamonga & Want To Stop By For A Bite You Won't Be Disappointed .. You Should Def Stop To This Location... I've Been Here More Than Once..& They've Always Had Great Costumer Service
Cilla P.,"Fontana, CA",150,186,192,5.0,1/4/2016,"I read so many great reviews on how delicious the Chicken Bellagio is, so i had to try it. I ordered it for takeout for dinner yesterday and my goodness the flavor was amazing! Its a pasta dish, noodles on the bottom of the plate layered with fresh Parmesan cheese, topped with fried boneless chicken, also served with something that looked like bacon, perhaps pancetta? and fresh spinach sauteed in some flavorful sauce.. soo good. I would order it again and recommend for you to try it, its a very larger portion good enough for 2 people."
Mary R.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,19,1,2.0,10/31/2016,"Ate here a while ago and I ordered the Cajun pasta. A portion of the pasta itself was green, slimy, hard, and stuck together. Not sure if the pasta was rotten or starting to mold, but it made me lose my appetite. Make sure to check the food here before you eat it."
Snith N.,"Glendale, CA",4,27,,5.0,5/2/2016,"This is five stars for the waiter called Will. That guy is the best I've seen in all the time I've spent in America. Charismatic, friendly and funny with a healthy touch of cynicism, he was attentive and entertaining throughout our meal despite his area being extremely busy. Will was so attuned to the needs of our table that he was topping up drinks, replacing bread baskets and sauces before we even realised we were out. Give this guy a raise already!"
Victor V.,"Pomona, CA",6,49,4,1.0,1/6/2016,"Walked in wasn't greeted hostess just said 2? Then walked away didn't ask us to follow he then says ummm this way? I'm like ok we sat he didn't say hello mention any specials nothing, ok what ever so our waitress comes up wasn't very friendly as well the food wasn't that good either. We walked out tipped more then 20 percent didn't get a goodbye thanks for coming nothing won't be back"
Antonio F.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",101,164,600,5.0,5/16/2015,"Luau Salad, great flavor very fresh. The wonton was crispy and the dressing was on point!"
Marisela V.,"Alhambra, CA",0,5,2,1.0,5/30/2017,"Wait time was way to long kept calling for someone for past 15 min when no one  is answering to it. Came in with my family for my cousins graduation dinner 2 kids 8 people total, had us waiting forever for our food maybe up to an hour 15min and 45 for our 2 appetizers. The waiter was extremely slow, and everyone else's food came at the same time and I was sitting there just snacking on leftover appetizer by the time my food came out everyone was done eating waiting on me to finish not only that but my chicken and mushrooms were burnt! There were burnt hard pieces everywhere on my plate I had to pick at my food and the Madeira sauce was burnt as well!!! I couldn't eat it anymore so I finished my aunts leftovers of her food. My sisters food was over cooked preferably the shrimp. Now I get chicken Madeira every time I come to Cheesecake Factory I've never been disappointed yet until I've come to this HORRIBLE LOCATION! FOOD HORRIBLE! SERVICE HORRIBLE! EVERYTHING JUST HORRIBLE."
Mary Jane L.,"Glendora, CA",59,12,14,5.0,4/18/2016,"We loved our experience here . good food , good service , reasonable price and good ambiance. Thumbs up to our server Maryellen. She patiently guided us in ordering and was very helpful. FOod we picked was delicious!!!"
Kathy C.,"Stevenson Ranch, CA",52,185,401,4.0,2/8/2015,Wait times are super long.  My fav item is the Thai chicken lettuce wraps. Would love to see a dairy free cheesecake option
Mimi Y.,"Ontario, CA",0,15,,1.0,4/10/2017,"On St. Patrick's day , my husband and I just wanted to go out and have dinner because we were starving.  We have never had a problem with Cheesecake Factory prior to this night. It was a weird vibe from the get go . First it took almost 15 minutes for anyone to acknowledge us and there were at least 5 or 6 servers that saw us sitting there . My husband was getting irritated , but I kept telling him they are probably busy even though most of the seating was open.  Then a waitress came over and asked if anyone has served us? We said no , so she said she would get the order for the other server. Then she ended up being our server.   Then our food never came out, she looked over at us and then said it was coming out soon. We continued to wait, then my food came out . My husband ordered the Cajun pasta with chicken and she brought his out without any chicken. We asked what happened , she said  she would get the order , then she came back and said they dropped the chicken.  Ok? So they couldn't make another dish or give us chicken and she apologized and said she would bring over a manager.  The manager came over and then said was there a problem , duh? What is going on? We said we were leaving and he had the nerve to ask me ""you didn't want your food""? I told him I'm not going to eat without my husband getting his food, why would you expect me to? It irritated my husband and the manager looked at us like we should have paid for the ice tea he ordered. We were pissed that we waited over 1 1/2 and still no meal. This experience was odd and unexpected from Cheesecake Factory.  It's a shame because we love the cheesecake and pasta dishes.  Never had someone tell us they dropped our food and could not replace it.   Manager is a douche   , now my husband never wants to go back there"
Emily O.,"Fontana, CA",182,63,121,4.0,4/1/2014,"Chicken Bellagio =  ! If you're a pasta fanatic, get the fettuccine chicken Alfredo with sun dried tomatoes. Unlimited bread! Whole grain one is my fav. This is one of my family's favorite places to eat. They have a new ""skinnylicious"" menu for the ""under 500 cal"" health conscious people."
