Karen T.,"San Bernardino, CA",44,5,1,5.0,4/23/2016,"I've always been fond of traditional American restaurants but have always eaten elsewhere for preference. Then I decided to give Cheesecake Factory a chance. The food was great, the atmosphere was up to par, but those two reasons won't be bringing me back. What will bring me back was the great service, the good positive attitude that I was fortunate enough to receive from the server Charles K. His explanation and suggestions in relation to the menu was exceptional. Never too much and never too little, it was just right. I made a good decision in regards to what I wanted to eat and I liked it. I felt that it was necessary, and I spoke to the manager of the restaurant to let him know Charles did a good good and I will be back soon. ----from my husband Gilbert, his first time at Cheesecake Factory."
Tiffany C.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,5,,1.0,11/13/2016,"I went to the Cheesecake Factory in Victoria Gardens today (11/13/16) around 2pm. I will say that this has been worst experience I have ever had at Cheesecake Factory. I ordered the shrimp pasta off of the lunch special menu and let the waiter know that I did not want any cheese on my pasta and he let me know that it did not come with cheese and that the sauce was regular marinara sauce. I receive the pasta and it had cheese in the sauce, I sent it back and the waiter said he could bring me a new one with no cheese.  Pasta # 2, still had cheese in it, I let him know that I was not trying to be difficult but I absolutely could not eat any dairy. He suggested a shrimp pasta with just tomatoes and basil, before I accepted his suggestion I asked, ""will it be the same price as the original pasta I ordered?"" the waiter replied, ""Yes"".  By the time I received my food, it was 3:40pm and my friend had already finished her food.  I received my bill and the waiter charged me $15.95 for the last pasta I was given.  I told the waiter, that he made a mistake on the bill because he told me that last pasta he suggested cost the same as the original pasta I ordered which was $13.95.  He let me know that he would fix it. The manger Elva came to my table with a non sympathetic ""oh well"" type of attitude and told me that, $15.95 was the price of the pasta they suggested and that I would need to pay that price. She did not care that I was told something different. She showed no customer service skills and could care less if I was a returning customer.  I asked her for the corporate phone number to make a complaint. She didn't even have enough decency to come back to give me the phone number herself, she sent it with the waiter, along with my $15.95 plus tax bill. I don't understand why she could not have just honored what I was told. I feel that my whole view of cheesecake factory has now changed and Elva ""the manager"" is the reason.  I will say that the waiter did apologize but the fact of the matter is I was lied to and was the one to suffer for the lie I was told. I DO NOT recommend Cheesecake Factory Victoria Gardens to anyone. Save your money and time for another restaurant in the area.  Oh and I am still calling corporate."
Kat H.,"Pomona, CA",23,218,431,3.0,1/2/2016,Service is bad.  Food is always good like it usually is.  Had to wait to be sat even though we seen tons of open tables. We did go on a weekend night... Drinks were hard to get refilled and servers were never to be found to even ask for extra napkins.  Hopefully next time will be better service
Sarah L.,"Monrovia, CA",68,10,7,3.0,5/24/2015,"Honestly, I would give the hostess 0 stars if possible, but the waitstaff made up for the crappy attitude we recieved from the hostess. Went for a birthday dinner with a party of 14 people on a Saturday night. Unfortunately they wouldn't accept any reservations, even with a large party. They told us it would take about 2 hours to be seated, which seemed reasonable for a busy night. After some time, a few people from our party wanted to check and see how much longer it would take. The hostess gave us an attitude about it so we asked to see a manager. A male gentleman claiming to be the manager came in and gave us the same attitude just because we wanted an update on our wait time.  After 2.5 hours, we finally get seated. Turns out, they turned off our pager as a result of us asking for a wait time update.  Our waitress definately made up for the crappy attitude we recieved from the hostess and manager. She was very attentive to our party and maintained her cheery attitude which eased us from the earlier confrontation. I would give her service an A+ for constantly refilling our drinks, checking up on our meal and her friendliness. The food was also decent enough for the price we paid.  I wouldn't recommend dining here with a large party, but I hope the restaurant will one day be able to accept reservations in the future or even at least upgrade the dining area to allow better accomodations for multiple large parties."
Erica R.,"Lake Forest, CA",0,20,2,2.0,9/17/2016,My girlfriends and I went there today for lunch I love the food there and overall have always had a good experience there. Today I ordered a lunch time special and when the bill came I saw that the waitress had charged me for a dinner plate. I mentioned to her the mistake and she told me that she entered it in wrong and that I did get The dinner size portion so I would have to be responsible for paying that. I asked everyone at the table to ensure I did in fact  say lunch size portion and they all heard it. Needless to say it's kind of annoying that she didn't charge me for what I had asked for regardless since it was HER mistake. Whatever I let it be and she boxed up my left overs as well as others at the table. She then proceeded to give us the leftovers specifically to each person so naturally I assumed she knew the food that she was giving each of us since she had boxed it herself.  I didn't realize until I got home (I live an hour away from my friends and that restaurant) that she had given me the wrong food! it's really annoying and disappointing to find out that my food that I overpaid for to begin with is now not even something I'm going to be able to enjoy. I should've complained to management when I was there because it's not fair that she made a mistake and overcharge me because of it and to top it off this wrong food is even worse now!
Betty O.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",88,5,15,5.0,4/19/2016,"Trevor was a wonderful server!  I enjoyed a wonderful lunch with my mom and sister earlier today. He was able to remember all the ingredients for the Shepards pie when we asked; he made sure the drinks stayed full and listened to my mom's jokes. The food was great as well, but I was impressed with the service today."
Ileana C.,"Morelia, Mexico",18,23,11,5.0,5/11/2016,"latte coffee is very good and I love desserts, my favorite is the limoncello mmm! And the service is very good and fast"
Chris A.,"Hesperia, CA",1915,52,29,5.0,11/14/2014,"What can I say,  this place is absolutely awesome. Every dish no matter the genre is on point. The service is always impeccable. Tonight I had the Hibachi steak which was fabulous with its very unique flavors. Now I will finish with my usual pineapple upside down cheesecake."
Chris K.,"Buena Park, CA",21,2,1,1.0,5/22/2016,Absolutely disgusting!!!!!! We were told there was a 15 minute wait and I went to the toilet and saw 6 tables empty. Asked them why there was a wait and they said the tables were closed. For fucks sake you Muppets get your organisation skills up
Barbra M.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,32,17,1.0,3/12/2016,"Went here tonight with my boyfriend.  He ordered the Pit Beef Sandwich and I got the Vietnamese Spring Rolls.  Sadly he's throwing up now...he said it tasted ""funny"" but didn't want to complain.  I REALLY wished he would've said something to me because I would've told them myself!  I'm VERY disappointed in Cheesecake factory!"
Ricardo G.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",810,356,394,1.0,6/28/2013,"For this place being so damn pricey you would think they would hire better bar tenders!!! We had a sucky ass bar tender. Went there last Thursday night. There was a hispanic looking dude in the back along with a girl. First, the guy didn't even acknowledge us UNTIL he helped the couple next to us who had gotten there 10 minutes after that. My fiance asked the guy for a drink menu, (which was sitting near us, but didn't know at the time) we waited,.... and waited,.... and waited, then he reaches over and opens it for us. We were like ""oh its been sitting here the whole time, why didn't he just tell us????"" So about 20 minutes have gone by and we haven't even ordered our first drink.  We ordered a slice of cheesecake and some water since it's been warm as of late. We finished our cheesecake when the waiter comes by and picks up our plates. My fiance and I are sitting there talking, when I reach over to drink some water.....GONE!! The waiter came by and took both of our half drank waters!!! I've NEVER, NEVER had water taken from me!! Usually waiters come by and keep filling it not take it! That proved to me that the male waiter was no good, and obviously the staff is not aware of it, which is why I am writing this review. I wish I would have gotten the waiters name, but I just wanted to get the heck out of there!!  Approach the bar with CAUTION!"
Marissa A.,"Fontana, CA",4,20,72,2.0,2/25/2015,"I've never been a fan of the food at Cheesecake Factory; everything I've ordered has tasted bland and mediocre at best. My most recent visit was for a family birthday so I was forced to go. Ordered the Tuscan chicken off the ""skinny"" menu and as I expected, I was not impressed.  From their menu, this entree is described as, ""Grilled Chicken Breast with Tomatoes, Artichokes, Capers, Fresh Basil and Balsamic Vinaigrette. Served Over Fresh Vegetables and Farro."" 1. The basil was absent 2. Vegetables in this case consisted of 5 asparagus halves 3. There was hardly any farro, and what was there was so soaked in the tomato juice and vinaigrette that it was just gross.  Presentation: Looks like I was served a plate of tomatoes with chicken hiding underneath.  On the plus side, the chicken was tasty and we had a very pleasant and attentive waitress."
David M.,"Fontana, CA",1,1,,1.0,5/4/2016,"Waited a half an hour to be seated in an empty restaurant , we were sitting directly in front of the hostesses,  35 minute of staring right at us she eventually asked us if we were waiting for a seat. Which may I add we did check in with these same hostesses when we came in the restaurant initially ."
Niecee J.,"Ontario, CA",1,27,3,1.0,1/5/2016,"We are regulars at this location and have never received such horrible service. We went on New Years Day and it was not as busy as expected. We had a server tianna and her attitude was unprofessional & rude. Every time we asked her a question it was as if we were inconveniencing her. The bread plates were dirty, we had to ask another waitress for bread and refills. I ordered an appetizer and side item I wanted to have as a meal and they brought them out separate. The manager had a friendly attitude however, did not compensate for our terrible service. I will stick to the location in riverside and LA from now on!"
Kismet F.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,4,,1.0,9/22/2016,"The service sucks! Drinks were too sweet and we sent them back during happy hour. By the time they returned it was outside of HH and again, they were horrible. We asked for something different but the manager israel came over and wanted to charge full price. We refused and that was the end of that. Stay away from this place. Many other places to choose from in the area. The managers need a little remedial in customer service."
Rosa Z.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",39,56,56,5.0,2/27/2015,"Ahhh so good, love the pastas here and the cheesecakes of course. Just a great place to come eat."
Shallana T.,"Apple Valley, CA",34,15,7,5.0,4/8/2016,"When my boyfriend and I started dating, we were too late to get in but a member of the staff was nice enough to allow us to come in to purchase a few slices of cheesecake.  That made such a positive impact on us that we now eat here for ""Date Night"". Last night, we were running late again and made it 10 minutes before closing. The staff was friendly and without any hesitation seated us and made our experience enjoyable.  Susie was pur waitress. Bubbly personality and even though we were the last table there, super hospitable! We plan to request her next date night!  We love taking cheesecake to go and have a goal to eat a slice of EVERY flavor! Great job guys!"
John T.,"Long Beach, CA",9,60,9,5.0,2/18/2016,"I love  the CCF! We always enjoy the Jamaican shrimp & chicken (with extra sauce/seasoning), shrimp scampi, jambalaya, carrot cake cheesecake, snickers cheesecake,etc."
Trevor N.,"Chino Hills, CA",13,21,14,1.0,2/27/2016,Needed reservations and understand they don't make reservations so I asked them what is the best way to make sure we could be seated by 7 with a party of 22 how early do we need to get there.  I was told 6 and that it shouldn't be a problem.  I told them are you sure because I need to be seated at 7 or a little after woulda been fine. Well I had someone there before 6 and was told we wouldn't be seated till 11.   Thanks for ruining the birthday dinner surprise for my wife and 21 of her friends.  Manager did nothing to help when I made him aware of the incident! Your loss
Robert O.,"Menifee, CA",192,5,,2.0,3/31/2016,"On a positive note, great customer service and they will take care of whatever goes wrong.  On the bad side, my wife ordered the Chicken Ramano and found a piece of rubber glove in the pasta. They comped us and gave her a round two and she found a hair in her food. Pretty sure we will never be back here again.  They made it right by comping dessert but still not a pleasant experience."
