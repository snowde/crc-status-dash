Dora T.,"Fontana, CA",38,4,4,1.0,9/17/2015,This Cheesecake Factory food or services is not like the one we went to in Marina Delray or Redondo Beach
Hassan P.,"New York, NY",339,134,149,3.0,1/23/2016,Nothing surprising here. Food was decent. I had the chipotle chicken sandwich which was good but they over dressed my salad. Menus were pretty sticky and dirty. Typical Rancho vibe. Victoria gardens however in general is a decent time.
Daniel P.,"Oceanside, San Diego, CA",12,23,113,4.0,1/24/2016,"This is my favorite cheesecake factory. Ive been coming here for about 6 years and have never been let down. The menu is really consisitent and you have the options of having big parties or a date. Most of these restaurants give the same consistent experience but i like the one in rancho is the best place to settle down after shopping. You have all of the stores you need close by and if it really crowded you can takes seats outside. Even in the winter it feels nice and warm due to the heaters they have. If there was anything i could complain about it would be that there isnt such a great waiting area inside. During the winter you dont want to wait outside it gets too cold and its the only place without the heaters. So when you go inside there are only two benches to sit and on the weekend that place gets swarmed. You cant call and make reservations so its tought to avoid the crowd. If you do see that its busy dont underestimate how quick they can seat you. Today when i went i would have guess were going to wait at least 45 minutes but the hostess said 15 minutes which actually ended up being 12. So always ask the wait. If you cant wait and its just you and one other person then check the bar, the seats are open to anyone who can snag them first."
Jaudiel D.,"Pomona, CA",1,4,3,5.0,5/24/2015,Fansy restaurant ... nice ..good food ... good desert! 5 stars...........................................
Norm N.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",2,100,47,3.0,9/9/2015,Typical consistent Cheesecake Factory food and service. The only bad thing is it's always crowded and the tables are cramped and small so you end up hearing the table next to you bitch and moan about their mundane life. No Sense of Personal Space. You basically sit there whispering to each other to get any sense of privacy. Get a booth if you can for more privacy but you have to wait longer.
Amina K.,"Chino, CA",58,136,105,5.0,1/9/2015,"I have been going to The Cheesecake Factory for many years and have always been happy with their entrees and service.  No matter which location I have been to, it has always been clean and pleasant.  We recently dined at this location and had a wonderful evening. The portions are always large enough for two people."
Jennifer S.,"Escondido, CA",416,873,603,4.0,2/22/2013,"I gotta say, I do really like the Cheesecake Factory.  This location is nice and I've been here lots of times and several times with large groups.  This last visit was with a large group.  The large groups get to be seated outside.  I was pretty worried that I'd be freezing so was bundled up, but the patio heaters really did a great job of keeping us warm. The servers were GREAT!  We had a LOT of people there, I don't even know how many.  People did do some moving around and they were able to break up the checks into groupings versus just making us have one single check, which I thought was nice.  I think they do a really good job of handling large groups. The location is nice, but I think overall it's just a little too dark.  Even the bathrooms are dark and I don't like that.  Turn on some lights, Cheesecake Factory! The food and drinks were great.  I don't think I heard anyone complain.  I was downing Jim Beam Lemonades and I had a delicious pasta dish with a lemon sauce and shrimp that I loved just as much when I finished it for lunch the next day! Overall, great experience.  The only think I kind of balked at is that I bought some cheesecake slices on my way out to take home and WOW!  Those bad boys are PRICEY!  They were tasty, but I don't think the three slices I bought were truly worth $23!  Because of that, I'd be giving them only 3.5 stars if I had the option.  OUCH. Can they get 5 stars?  Nope... The chain restaurant could keeps them down in my book.  Sorry CF."
Charlene C.,"Victorville, CA",33,89,28,5.0,1/17/2015,"Great food and service. I had my favorite, the fresh vegetable salad.   My daughter had Evelyn s  pasta and loved it. Well  be back!"
Chris B.,"Corona, CA",21,394,1140,3.0,10/27/2013,"Cant believe how packed this place can be. Service provided was the best they could given the amount of people in this place. Portions are enough to get a hungry man full. Ordered the american kobe beef burger and it was juicy, just the right amount of size. Surprised by the eclectic menu and the sheer amnt of selections"
MissNug D.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",74,7,,1.0,9/20/2015,"Very disappointed in tonight's dinner. My hubby and I ordered dinner. He is dairy intolerant so he ordered chicken and they substituted just about everything.  I ordered a Cobb salad. Not so difficult, right? He gets his food and I waited...and waited.  It came when someone had a aha moment. The manager came out to apologize but it was just too late and I'm just not hungry anymore, and no I don't want a box for my salad. He offered to take it off my bill. Really??? I just wasted half an hr to not get my food. That wasn't the end of it. My hubby didn't get fries with his food like he was supposed to.  In the end, it was a waste to come here for dinner. I walk away with a distaste for this restaurant."
Pat A.,"Venice, FL",31,150,275,5.0,9/28/2014,"Phenomenal Service. Great Bar. Great Food. Great Location. Held a family luncheon for 25 people. We ate and laughed for the next 3 hours. Our waitress Stephanie was the best of the best. Always smiling, all orders correct, (not easy to do with 25 people that kept changing seats!), and always checking if anyone needed anything. And Will gave us a song and dance routing on top of all of the excellent service. The food is really good. I had the Chicken Bellagio. Lightly breaded chicken breast on top of basil spaghetti. Everyone else enjjoyed their meals and they are large portions.   It is a huge menu, so I suggest you go online before arriving and study it. Most of us had dessert and decadent cheesecake. So many to choose from! I get dizzy just thinking about it! They are big slices, so think about sharing.  It truly was an all around enjoyable experience so I give it 5 stars. Oh, and when you leave, you can stroll down beautiful cobblestone open air streets and shop to your hearts delight at Victoria's Gardens outdoor mall!"
Moli F.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,8,2,1.0,6/4/2016,"SHAME ON YOU Cheesecake Factory Rancho Cucamonga. They ruined my MBA graduation day. I made a reservation with the Dean the store manager for the patio about a month before my graduation day, had at least 15 phone conversations with Dean arranging for the day, the last call was the day before the graduation day to confirm on everything, the check in time was 12:30, ordered 24 appetizers to be ready for my guests when they arrive and 2 whole cakes as deserts. Arrived to the location at 12:45 with my 36 guests, found my reservation is canceled and the patio is full of people, when I talked to the manager on duty his name was Jeff (I guess) he said sorry there is nothing we can do for you, and the wait for a party that big is about 2 hours.  My guests were doctors, lawyers, business men and women, and a TV station owner and producer. After my husband almost had a fight with Jeff the manager, we waited for an hour to be seated in a sad long table in the big patio with people all around us, service was horrible, as if you are sitting in a tacos truck in the street. The manager didn't even apologize, he probably felt as if he made us a favor by seating us. Dean the manager who I originally made the reservation with didn't call to follow up or apologize for what happened and the magnificent embarrassment they caused me in front of my whole family and friends, haven't heard from them until now. Unacceptable behavior from a Resturant I though would be a good place to celebrate my important day in. They completely ruined my day, ruined my once in a life time experience that will never be repeated, it's gone forever. SHAME ON YOU Cheesecake Factory Rancho Cucamonga."
Robert G.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,77,124,1.0,8/3/2015,"Dead flies next to our table. That is not the sight you want to see before having a meal. This is just lazyness and poor management. We ordered the Chicken Picatta and the portions are smaller, prices are higher and the poultry was rubbery. We went to celebrate a birthday and the server said she would bring a birthday ""surprise,"" and asked me if I wanted cheesecake. We had been to the Cheesecake Factory a few years ago for a birthday and were given a free small scoop of ice cream. This time the servers came to sing and brought the cheesecake I ordered and slapped some whip cream and sprinkles on it with scribbled chocolate sauce saying ""Happy Birthday,"" and then added it to the bill. That's fine. I was expecting to pay for the cheesecake, but no small birthday freebie was disappointing. Back to the flies, they were everywhere in the restaurant and one landed on our brown bread. We won't be going back."
Mark M.,"Loma Linda, CA",16,59,3,5.0,9/29/2014,"Cheesecake factory never fails me (especially when you know what to order) Today the wife and me got: 1. Chicken Madeira 2. Kobe burger 3. Dulce de leche cheesecake And of course the brown bread with butter is always awesome. A restaurant is all about good food. I love coming mid afternoons.  Less people and a moment of peace with the one you love. The service to me is always excellent. The miso salmon is also one of my faves. I'll get it next time. It is pretty pricey. But the price to me is totally worth it. :) knowing where and when to go is always key. Get what you know is awesome, but always leave room to try something new. :)"
Rebecca C.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",4,34,5,3.0,8/1/2015,I don't know if they are understaffed or the servers don't like to come by as often but I never get refills or fast efficient service. The food is good I have no complaints there but what does someone have to do to get a refill? Or put in another order? They don't pay very much attention to their guests this was my third time here
Mona T.,"Chino Hills, CA",54,106,44,5.0,3/1/2013,"I've come to this restaurant quite a few times but this time was my favorite. i was craving eggs and so i ordered the quesadilla breakfast omelet or something like that? and WOW it was amazing! it was a huge portion so i took some home and ate it later wow it was exactly what i was craving and it hit the spot.  waiter was super nice, went at lunch time on weekday so not busy at all. got the oreo cheesecake...wow amazing as well.. oops forgot to add we tried the appetizer samosas and they were surprisingly yummy, of course not authentic indian tasting but i liked the modern twist on it, ill have it again =)"
Jennifer S.,"West Covina, CA",34,15,19,4.0,5/20/2015,"It was a good time went for dinner...red sangria  !!! I had the jambalaya pretty good, nice flavors a nice hint of spice. Definitely going back soon,  would like to try their brunch."
Giselle V.,"Irvine, CA",213,282,1594,4.0,9/1/2013,"I love this restaurant because the menu offers so many different types of food. The wait staff is always friendly and it never takes too long to get our food. I've never ordered anything off the menu that did not taste great. The cheesecakes are also very delicious, but my favorite is their classic cheesecake with fresh strawberries."
Sarkis K.,"Fontana, CA",13,104,44,4.0,7/20/2014,"They have alot of selections in their menu, it would be nice if they had a section for vegetarians on one page. Overall the place is very nice and if course the cheesecake are unbeatable. Great place!"
Christel L.,"Murrieta, CA",572,641,1647,3.0,10/9/2014,"This is your standard Cheesecake Factory.The location within the mall is convenient for parking because you can park in the adjacent lot and walk straight over to the doors rather than around the streets and corners of the mall. The ambiance is nice, the service is okay, the food is tasty and drinks are good, but it's not the cheapest restaurant to go to. I've actually never had their cheesecake, which is funny because like someone else mentioned, I always used to think all they served was desserts before I actually dined with them."
