Cindy K.,"Winchester, CA",33,49,27,5.0,1/18/2015,"My hubby and I love coming here, always great service! Our food is always on point and you can not leave the restaurant without having a piece of cheesecake, the Oreo cheesecake is one of my favorite, I skip the appetizer so I can have room for dessert!!"
Rafael A.,"Fontana, CA",0,17,3,1.0,7/17/2016,"When they sat us down, our table was not prepared and still dirty. Then we got our food cold...mashed potatoes are not good cold. We asked them to reheat...they brought it back still cold. My wife's shrimp were not all deveined. You go out with the family to have a good experience...it's hard to do this with this level of service. Will not be back."
Nadia K.,"Ontario, CA",2,18,2,1.0,6/24/2015,"I went with a friend and while we were eating I saw a roach on my friends side of the booth! I told my friend not to make a big deal taking into consideration that thwre was a party of about 15 ppl next to us. We told the waiter. They tried to kill it with the napkin and then said ""I think we got it"" which did nothing for us to think there ""might"" be a roach around still, or a dead one around us.  few min later here comes the manager apologizing. I realized my pasta had bacon which i cannot have and he said he wouldn't charge it and did not offer me a new plate. but still charged the ten dollar salad my friend ordered. This is a serious matter and both the employees and the manager handled it badly."
D. B.,"Upland, CA",0,8,10,2.0,7/31/2016,"Service and food are always excellent  here. However, I would give an extra star (or two) if not for the bothersome gnats that we have encountered the past few visits. Just one or two here and there, but it's enough to make our dining experience less than pleasurable. Hoping this problem is resolved so we can come back soon.  UPDATE: So I prematurely gave a good review for the service and food. Our food was brought out by a different server and my husband's waffle was cold, as well, the toppings were left off. Our server walked by a couple of times without checking on us so it took a while to send it back. When it came back, the waffle was actually perfect!  Also had dirty menu and silverware.  We come here quite often, and these issues happen here VERY rarely. I'm changing the review to two stars for this particular visit only."
Cindy F.,"Chino, CA",9,30,1,5.0,1/9/2016,Excellent. This location never disappoints. It was packed but only waited 30 min. I order something different every time and always amazing! The Pit Beef Dip is the bomb. It's as good as Nicks in Laguna beach. Thanks CF
Arianne S.,"Camarillo, CA",28,116,51,5.0,8/25/2014,"There was 9 of us and it was pretty crowded but we didn't wait long at all! We came here to celebrate my birthday and our server was on top of everything and super nice. When everybody's food came out, it was ALL amazing. I wish I was over exaggerating but the food there is pretty awesome. At the end of it all they gave me a mini hot fudge sundae and sang happy birthday. It was an incredible experience and I'm so looking forward to the next time we go."
Adela S.,"Diamond Bar, CA",52,4,,4.0,2/17/2016,I have always loved Cheesecake Factory.  However we rarely come to this location. Came on Valentine's Day and my husband and I were fortunate to get a table at the bar within 5 minutes of arriving. We ordered drinks and appetizers and the service was very good.  I had the lettuce wraps but my husband did not try them. At 1:00 am I became very sick to my stomach - food poisoning. Did anyone else get sick from the lettuce wraps?
Sofia P.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",2,3,1,5.0,2/17/2016,Love it! Food is always amazing . Try the fried Mac and Chesse appetizer. I always have a great experience here
Katie S.,"Riverside, CA",58,64,17,3.0,11/8/2014,I'm on the fence of what to rate it. Came her for my birthday and had the worst service ever here. But the food was great! And of course the cheesecake was amazing. But the service was horrible. So 3 stars it is
Odie O.,"San Diego, CA",2,1003,63,5.0,9/10/2014,"Always excellent service at this chain, this one is not super busy and noisy and has lots of parking. I love their atmosphere and decor as well as the Grand Lux in Vegas, food is always good with large portions."
Kim T.,"Orange County, CA",1156,1046,2847,4.0,9/20/2010,"It's Cheesecake Factory...really, what more can you say.  No need for a full review, so I'll just review what I ate.  I didn't want a huge dish, so I just ordered a few things off the new small portions/ mini menu. Corn Fritters:  Really good.  I couldn't stop myself from eating them.  Sweet corn fritters, perfectly crispy on the outside with a great dipping sauce. Chicken Croquettes:  Pass!  Really plain.  No flavor.  Can't taste the chicken.  Just tastes like fried cream stuff.  Blah!! Sweet Potato Fries:  Big order, really crispy and good. This location has the longest wait.  It's horrendous."
Nicole S.,"La Verne, CA",1,99,16,5.0,7/23/2016,"I enjoyed my experience here, my husband did as well. We went early because we know how busy it gets. I've never had a meal there before all ways the cheese cakes. Very tasty filet mignon cooked just the way I liked it. The mashed potatoes and green beans was awesome. Strawberry daquari was good and so was my husband's merlot. The staff was very attentive and nice. Very nice atmosphere will definitely be coming back. The other guest were pleasant as well. :)"
Kevin C.,"Riverside, CA",37,137,60,4.0,8/25/2014,"The Cheesecake Factory is a cool spot to eat at when you have the extra money to splurge. It's pretty pricey (up to $20 a plate) but they have a huge menu so there's always something for everyone. Literally, the menu was like 15+ pages long and that excluded the cheesecakes! I loved the ambiance and decor paired with an attentive wait staff. The lighting was dimmed down and interior design reminded me of the Bellagio. Our main dishes were excellent and had good flavors that you wouldn't expect from a place like this. The black pepper Jamaican chicken was very tasty and the spices were on point. The main dish portions are definitely a shareable size if you're trying to save some dough though. We also had calamari and buffalo wings which were also delicious but again, pricey. Was about $12 per appetizer and only came with 8 wings, so you do the math. Overall, if you have a sexy date and a pocket full of cash, I recommend you to take them to this modern and romantic restaurant."
Renee D.,"Wildomar, CA",1,4,,1.0,8/13/2016,Had the worst service ever I would never recommend this location manager didn't care one bit
Kendruh R.,"San Bernardino, CA",4,42,44,2.0,8/12/2014,"Let's begin, number one they don't do reservations which is a complete inconvenience so our wait was supposed to be 45 minutes. We ended up waiting over an hour on a Tuesday night and the only reason we got seated was because people in the party I was with complained. The waiter wasn't too bad he did what he could, other people in my party didn't agree. The food was ok no complaints, the manager on the other hand was rather rude! We were celebrating a birthday and it ended terribly. This was my first time coming to the Cheesecake Factory and more than likely it will be last! I also bought a slice of ""strawberry cheesecake"" which was actually a regular cheesecake with 3 strawberries on top that cost me 8$ I could have made that myself and been happier. From what I experienced this restaurant is overhyped."
Sean D.,"Fontana, CA",55,33,68,4.0,8/15/2014,"Only thing I like about this place is for there happy hour. They don't take reservations if you want to dine in so that blows. As for there happy hour selection they have a fairly good selection to choose from, like the spring summer rolls, buffalo blast and the pot stickers. There IPA beer is good to if you like beer, also they have 4 different cocktails to choose from if you are not into beer."
Kevin C.,"Tipton, CA",1,30,2,2.0,7/14/2015,I went here with a friend  to have launch. We both ordered a renae''s special chicken salad sandwich. The tomatoes were unripe and their was hardly any chicken on it. So the waitress brought us extra chicken. Then when we talked to the manager  he didn't  seem to care we had the worst sandwich we have ever eaten. He seemed to not take pride in his work. I will never go here again and do not suggest u do unless u have to.
Monique H.,"Washington, DC",106,107,26,3.0,8/3/2015,Spoke with the Senior GM and feel much better. I appreciate his focus on making it right for the guest.
Scott D.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",88,137,142,5.0,8/25/2014,"Outstanding food, better than average service.  We went for the Sunday Brunch menu with family.  The food doesn't get any better.  Bruléed French toast, Monte Cristo Sandwich, and Baja Chicken Hash were our crowd's favorites. Only improvement could have had more attentive service from our server, but it was better than average at nearby restaurants."
Fancy P.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,18,22,5.0,8/8/2015,"Went here today with my mom and boyfriend. Enjoyed everything like always. I love their skinnylicious veggie burger. Get that every time! Server had a great attitude and she was on top of everything. We sat in their beautiful outdoor patio area...Very happy, will come back"
