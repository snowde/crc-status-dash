Michelle J.,"Ontario, CA",2,41,26,3.0,7/11/2015,Our waitress Karlie was the best!! We are celebrating my Sister's birthday.. The food and service was exceptional!! I recommend this restaurant to everyone!!
Sara K.,"Glendora, CA",17,12,1,1.0,5/24/2015,"So disappointed in this place. Came to celebrate my 21st birthday and waited more than 2 hours to be seated. Worst part is, they DO NOT take reservations which is complete bull****. It was my birthday so of course I had a big group (14), knowing beforehand that I was going to be waiting a while, but I didn't think almost 3 hours. The manager, Gabriel, put us down on the list for 2 hours but we ended up waiting basically 3 hours. After waiting, our buzzer didn't even go off so I'm pretty sure if we didn't go up to ask them how much longer, we would've never gotten seated.  Apparently they only have 2 large tables, one inside and one outside. There was already a party of 12 that got there before us. An hour goes by and they seat a party of 16 that came in AFTER us. We go and talk to the manager and the associates tell us that there's nothing they could do. They were rude and had an attitude. The manager, Gabriel, was in no way professional. He made it clear to us that he was the ""manager"" as if he were the president of the United States and did nothing to ease our anger. Being a manager doesn't make you ""special"" lol anyone can be a manager and have better customer service than he did. He told us ""You have to wait, people are celebrating their graduations and birthdays blah blah blah"" like me wearing a big a** light up sash didn't make it obvious we were too! LOL. He even had the nerve to tell us ""15 more minutes"" like he knew that the party that we were waiting for was going to be done by then. Guess what idiot, we waited not 15, but 45 extra minutes including the 2 hours you supposedly put us down for.  This Cheesecake Factory sucks. They need to learn their manners and serve better customer service AND take reservations. Besides the horrible service from the ""manager"" and the two girls up front, our waitress was awesome! She was sweet and very helpful. But I still rate this place 1 star, if I could put no stars, I wouldn't think twice. :)"
Moni R.,"Long Beach, CA",125,62,193,1.0,5/30/2015,It's been a week since I visited.  I came in for my birthday with my family. It wS a long wait but we didn't mind. It was the waiting after we had ordered our drinks. The waiter took the next table food order straight away even though they arrived after we did. After 20 min of waiting on a beverage order he finally took our order. 45 min- an hour later our food arrived. By this time we all just wanted to go home. Not once did the waited come back and ask for refills.. It was discouraging.  He was obviously overwhelmed or something. It put a little damper on my birthday.
Trevor W.,"Azusa, CA",349,76,332,4.0,5/26/2015,This is a big booming busy place to eat so plan on spending at least an hour once you get seated. Reservations are necessary if you don't want to wait long. Everything you order is pretty good. Check out the fried mac & cheese balls.
Rick S.,"Madison, WI",1,34,,5.0,5/17/2016,"A great experience right here in Victoria Gardens!  Top-notch food, drinks & desert.  Servers are friendly & helpful.  A good over-all experience every time."
Dennis G.,"Irvine, CA",46,37,21,3.0,7/1/2014,Always good food. BBQ Chicken Salad was excellent but way big! Pot stickers are awesome & cheese bread is delicious.
Lisa V.,"Upland, CA",0,2,,1.0,3/29/2016,Horrible management....went to have dinner and while eating a ROACH crawled on our table .....waitresses called management and all she said was sorry ..... I sent back my plate as I lost my appetite so that wasn't charged but she had the nerve to charge us one meal and an appetizer..... No free dessert no comp no nothing.....
Richard O.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",67,30,18,1.0,5/25/2015,"This place had me, my friends, and boyfriend waiting for 2 hours and 30 minutes. They kept telling us that it'll be another 30 minutes after another. We had complained to them and asked if there was anything we could get for a complimentary, they refused and as I was talking to the manager who was on duty on 05/23/15 around 6:40 pm he was super rude and replied as ""I'm the manager.."" I didn't appreciate it at all. I didn't care if he was the manager, just the fact that he was a jerk. The receptionist ladies that night as well, we're super rude. One of them that was wearing red lipstick that night, she replied to me as I walked to the table and had asked her if my table was ready, she said ""you come up here too much.."" I didn't like that. Who trained her? Because they sucked. She was super rude and her customer service sucked ass. She needs to either change her attitude and behavior or get re-trained. Also, they kept moving those of groups of 2-6 ahead of us when they came in at a later time than us. Which didn't make sense!  Overall the food was good and the waitress was super nice and friendly. That is why I'm giving it a 1 otherwise I would have given it  a 0 for me. Customer service at the front end sucked! Make them better (:  And by the way, you guys need to make bigger tables because 2 isn't going to work for those who have to wait. And/or have options such as combining the tables together. They didn't offer anything! It was super annoying and not worth the time. I could have gone somewhere else but it wasn't my birthday. It was my cousins girlfriend."
Global T.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,30,,1.0,10/5/2014,"We went yesterday a party of 14 people and we had the worst customer service ever. First the table took 1:10 hrs longer than the given time to be prepared, although the place was not that busy. Second the food took forever to serve (Note that they didn't bring us any bread) The waitress was really mean and dropped food on one of the party members. Very disrespectful unprofessional service."
Kellenne O.,"Fontana, CA",229,131,37,4.0,2/23/2013,"We got a gift card from work for Christmas so I decided to treat myself before picking up the children from school.  I arrived at 3:30 and noticed a sign that said Happy Hour 4:00pm so I took a walk to H&M to kill time and boy was it worth it! The $5:00 bar menu was filled with tantalizing offers. I started with a Mojito  the bartender did not play. I ordered the Tamale and Naked Shrimp which was actually $6.00 and the avocado egg rolls OMG amazing the Tamale is so freaking mouth watering the Shrimp was ok. I was talking to the women and her daughter next to me and I offered them an avocado roll because the portions are big they offered a fried mac and cheese ball heh very good wow 2,000 calories later.  I packed a full dinner treat for the children. All under $25.00 thanks Boss! The bar staff was super nice and my server was on it I will come here on a date with my KING!"
Lacey H.,"Fontana, CA",6,59,33,1.0,3/26/2015,Saw a waitress literally kicking a fork on the floor all the way from the middle of the restaurant to the kitchen. The worst part is there were at least two waiter stations on the way she could have stopped at to set her plates down and just pick it up and put it on top. Disgusting.
Christie G.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",3,7,,5.0,10/26/2014,Pumpkin Cheesecake!!!! And cheesecake in general!  Luau Salad is great  Any of the sandwiches  The Cajun jumbalian pasta  Buffalo Blast are a must!! Ask for more blue cheese though.  Waitstaff is great! And super nice! Love the mood lighting as well;)
Christine L.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",200,20,2,2.0,7/14/2016,Highly disappointed in my experience yesterday. My mother came from out of town so I decided to treat her and my roommates to dinner. I feel like I wasted $150 yesterday. I got the steak Dianne like I always do and it came out over cooked it tasted off in a bad way and the mashed potatoes were extremely lumpy (like huge pieces I had to cut to put in my mouth) and lacked flavor. My mothers got a veggie sandwich which she had never tried and she just didn't like it (ok not their fault). One of my roommates ordered the orange chicken and they brought out orange shrimp. We were hungry so we didn't send back either plate. I gave +2 stars due to my server having a great attitude but I have to admit I go out to eat for good food not good servers.
Felicia L.,"Long Beach, CA",600,1593,658,3.0,12/14/2010,"The same as all the other Cheesecake Factories I've been too.... Even the same layout! It's funny, lol. Anyways, just to keep it short and simple, great ambiance, large portions of food, and $10 fancy drinks. The desserts are great. Great place to take out on a date or go with some friends or family. As a personal note, I have been here way too many times, so it kinda lost it's appeal on me. I think I would only come here now for a dessert to share, their desserts are yummy...."
Samantha C.,"Mar Vista, Los Angeles, CA",387,34,7,2.0,3/3/2014,"I went for brunch and ordered a $9 mini-egg breakfast. It came with one egg, breakfast potatoes, and 4 slices of toast. The breakfast potatoes were NASTY. I swear they must have been sitting under a heat lamp for fours hours, scooped up, and plopped next time my sad, little egg. Extremely underwhelming. And what the hell was up with my bellini? A reall bellini contains a mixture of Prosecco sparkling wine and peach purée or nectar. This shit-storm of a cocktail tasted like a Jack in the Box iced smoothie with two drops of sparkling wine. I know my alcohol, and this was unacceptable. Thank you for the reminder that I absolutely hate The Cheesecake Factory. At least our waitress was nice."
John P.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",87,337,45,4.0,6/22/2014,"Although a massive chain, I really like the Cheesecake Factory. They have a really large menu which can satisfy any appetite (portions are HUGE) and the flavor and ethnicities of the food is vast. Of course, Cheesecake is the best here with so many selections you could go crazy.  Nice bar area with open seating high tops. The rest of the place can fill up pretty quickly (like everything else in Victoria Gardens). Make a reservation or put your name in and walk around the shopping center. The outdoor patio has a gorgeous view of the mountains.  We like to split a bunch of the appetizers or small plates when we come. Portions are just too big on everything else (however, everything we have eaten here is good). I always have to get the Ahi Tartare when I come."
Susie M.,"San Dimas, CA",39,16,,4.0,7/3/2016,"We love the food here and come here often, but this morning the hostess that was seating us, was not observant at all. We had placed our name in with hostess at computer and were the only 2 people waiting when she came walking up and grabbed the paper with our name, she read it and yelled out our name, as if it were a crowded room or we were no place in site. Then when we got to our table, instead of handing us our menus, she placed them on our place settings, when my hand was out to take it. My point is that she was just not present and very mechanical, unlike regular service here at cheesecake. We had also gotten there at opening and love to sit outside whenever possible when we dine out.  This particualar cheesecake has two large covered outdoor patios, the hostess said there was a 10 min wait to sit out there, again, when there was no other customers waiting to be seated, and nobody sitting out there yet. The server we got was very good and attentive."
Telling It Like It Is K.,"Mission Viejo, CA",1,60,8,1.0,5/4/2015,Our food was terrible at this location. The carbonara was super dry not creamy at all. sent back which I hate to do and took almost 30 minutes to get chicken marsala. Crappy service on Saturday night.
Cisco S.,"Highland, CA",45,3,4,2.0,5/7/2015,"I was craving to eat my favorite dish which is ""Bang Bang Coconut Chicken Only"" I was greeted with the host right away I was sat. My server came & asked me what I want to drink. I only ordered water with no ice. I knew what I wanted to ordered so she won't have to take two trips to asked if I was ready to order. The dish comes with chicken & shrimp but I only wanted only with chicken. As soon as I order I set my stop watch timer to see how long it would take. She took 10 minutes to bring my bread. Still waiting for my food at around 18 minutes I grab her attention to ask more brown bread. By the time my water was half empty & never refilled my water which is the most common thing to do as a server.  Around 29 minutes she comes to tell me that my dish they made it with both chicken & shrimp that they are working on to ""fix it"" I don't know how they can make that mistake either the server put it wrong the order or the cooks are so used to make it with chicken & shrimp. When my food came she didn't apologize it took that long. She set it there & I asked for a refill. I ate it fast because I was so hungry & food was delicious. They never change the recipe & kept it consistent. That's the only winner about it. Overall the server was bad for being a thursday at 10pm not being busy at all. Would I come back? Yes for the same dish if they keep it the same but hopefully I get a better serving experience next time. Thanks Cheesecake Factory Rancho Cucamonga"
Jackie M.,"Ontario, CA",32,54,93,1.0,5/20/2014,We came and purchased a cheese cake for a birthday. Asked for them to write happy birthday on the cake they said they can't which doesn't make sense because when you order a slice of cake for a birthday they write happy birthday on the plate with chocolate.. So when they said you can buy a sign for $2 extra I said fine! When we got to the restaurant and sang happy birthday I was beyond upset and disappointed when I saw the 7 year old writing on the cake!! What the heck? It's so ridiculous! Never again will I go back
