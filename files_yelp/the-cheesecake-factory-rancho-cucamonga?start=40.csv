David G.,"Fontana, CA",352,95,185,5.0,5/2/2017,"How do I start?  This is my favorite place to eat! Their multi-page menu from beginning to end everything that I've tried has been nothing less that awesome! I think you can blind pick your meal and you can believe you will be served a plate with original flavor and cooked to perfection. Salads- come in servings that can feed 2 and each with a unique flavor. My favorites are the Chinese Chicken, Sheila's Chicken, Santa Fe and Cobb. Burgers- You gotta try a Kobe Burger. Pastas- Here is where you just pick one! I love them all. Jambalaya, Evelyn's, Louisiana Chicken, Farfalle w/chicken, spicy chipotle are all full of their own unique flavors. Desserts- can't go wrong with any of the cheesecakes but if you want something different, try the strawberry shortcake during strawberry season( April- July), great option. Also the lemon torte. Bar- they have a bunch of specialty drinks just ask the bartender for a recommendation but I love the original and pineapple mojitos"
Nate C.,"Ontario, CA",0,12,17,4.0,8/13/2017,"I sit at the bar  the so i don't have to wait for a table As Always great food ., Large portions. The service could be better.. but they need more help, so i understand. I had the mushroom burger with a salad.Excellent."
Victoria M.,"Temecula, CA",0,10,8,3.0,8/27/2017,"My waitress recommended the chipotle chicken pasta even though I told her I'm not able to eat anything spicy.  She assured me that it wasn't spicy at all and I won't be disappointed.  Well,  after a few bites of it I had heart burn,  but I'm to blame because I agreed to ordering something with word ""chipotle"" in it.   The lemoncello creme  torte was delicious and didn't have a overwhelmingly tart lemon flavor.  It was light with fresh cream,  so heavenly!   The tables are cramped and music loud so it was a ""fair"" dinner experience  with the exception of the fabulous desserts."
Katherine M.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",13,28,27,1.0,9/1/2017,This review is just for the front desk/bakery. Every time I call for curbside pick up the hostess is incredibly rude when she transfers to the bakery. Usually the bakery takes about 5 minutes to take the order. Today I called 3 separate times Bc I was on hold for 10 minutes each time. I would understand if I called during the lunchtime rush but I called at 1:45 pm. The last time I called I tried to have the hostess take my order but she immediately transferred me again to the bakery. I love the convenience of the curb side pick up and hope that the next time I call I will have a better experience and I can change my rating to 5 stars.
Melika K.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",58,75,73,4.0,12/3/2017,"I come here often because it is close to where I live and you have a lot options to choose from. The menu is like any other cheesecake factory. I have tried their sheperd's pie, pasta with sausage and shrimp, chicken on bread crumbs) pizza style, and other things. You can sit outside and have a view of mountains which is nice."
April A.,"San Jacinto, CA",81,6,1,5.0,10/24/2017,I've dined at Cheesecake over a dozen times.  We always end up at the bar.  Steven and Aaron are amazing.  They always remember what our group orders and they always have great conversation.  Definitely one of my fave spots in the Gardens.
Cierra W.,"Claremont, CA",18,10,3,4.0,11/25/2017,I have went to the Cheesecake Factory a few times recently and have found myself repeatedly unimpressed. The first time I had the Cajun chicken pasta which was okay I think it would have been better if it had more flavor and the pasta was not over cooked. This past Friday I had the roasted lemon chicken with steamed carrots and mashed potatoes. I really enjoyed this meal. I also had the key lime cheesecake which really satisfied my sweet tooth!
Jenn N.,"San Gabriel, CA",14,71,85,5.0,8/8/2017,The food is great & the service is fast but the cheesecake selection is what they are known for. Never disappointed whenever I dine here.
Bryan F.,"Costa Mesa, CA",0,3,,2.0,12/4/2017,"Went for a late lunch 12/3/17. Food is good. Drinks are good (but be sure to ask what the price is$$$). Service was very friendly but oh so slow...... First off, we waited patiently with our pager in hand for close to an hour. That's fine. That's what the pager is for.  THEN three groups pagers go off AT ONCE, we turn it in, and stand around 15 more minutes, after giving up our nice seats in the lobby. Why do they page you if they're not ready?! My only guess is to trick corporate into thinking they seat people faster? Not really sure. That's literally never happened to me before anywhere. Ever.  Then, the drinks took forever. And apps took forever. I almost forgot what I ordered by the time the food came.  But again, our sever was very friendly and made it ok. Hey, Manager. Hire more people!! And don't page people early! Terrible start to a nice, but shockingly extended night."
Tasha V.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",264,285,152,4.0,4/8/2017,"I am a fan of Cheesecake Factory. Mostly because of the dessert options, which is the only reason I have given them four stars. The many choices of cheesecakes are endless and all very good. I have yet to have bad service, however the wait to be seated is always ridiculous. The food is slightly above average of a chain restaurant but the higher prices say otherwise. The large menu offers so many choices, of any food type, which makes the dining experience fun.  Dine or Dash? Dine. However, if there are other options near by, I will probably give them a try first."
S E.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,3,2,1.0,9/16/2017,"Today was a special occasion, we made our reservation last Thursday and specified it was for a birthday. We were seated promptly at our time of reservation, and things started going downhill from there.  When we all put in our orders, my dad, whose birthday it is, specified he would like his dish served hot. It took about 40 minutes for us to receive our food, AND although the plate itself was very hot, his food was cold.  We sent it back and the waitress offered to remake it, saying it would only take 10 minutes. 20 minutes later, the rest of us have finished our food while my dad is still sitting there, hungry. He told the waitress to cancel the order as we'd already finished our meals and he'd feel uncomfortable eating his food while we watch on for another 20 minutes. We asked to speak to the manager. 10 minutes later, still no manager, so we ask a server passing by for the manager. Neither the manager nor the waitress were apologetic. The manager admitted they had been having that problem today, but did not explain how he'd go about resolving it.  It's my dad's birthday, and on his birthday he watched his entire family eat a meal he was very much looking forward to, without him. Although we specified that this was a birthday occasion, no cake was brought out, no song was sung. Other tables celebrating birthdays got that special treatment, while we did not, although we had made reservations a few days in advance specifying it was a birthday occasion.  Overall, an extremely disappointing trip. My dad's day is completely ruined. We will never return to the Cheesecake Factory again."
Liezl M.,"San Bernardino, CA",26,49,142,5.0,2/19/2017,Always a long wait at this location but I always end up finding a table at the bar. I always order the same thing here and it gets me pretty full! -ALL wheat bread -buffalo blast w/ a side of rice  -Chinese chicken salad With strawberry lemonade!
Katherine R.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,27,2,1.0,12/26/2017,"Service was awfully slow but our waitress seemed super busy so we were understanding....then my moms food came out cold. We kindly told the waitress , so she apologized and told the manager. 20 min later she said the manager offered us a free slice of cheesecake. We were just so disappointed with the service at that point we just wanted to go home, so we asked if they could just comp the dish. Another 20 min later (and all our food already in to-go boxes) the manager comes out and unapologetically tells us that in order to comp the cold enchiladas that he needs the meal back ...um awkward!! I'm not kidding - he made us open all the to-go boxes to find the half eaten enchiladas so he could literally throw away the food. BAD JUDGMENT CALL DUDE. Sigh, this is a true story."
Duri H.,"Upland, CA",583,128,785,4.0,6/25/2016,"We've all had Cheesecake Factory a dozen of times so I can't share any new insights. So I thought to mention a few of my go to dishes that I can't stop ordering!  Chicken samosas: Perfect appetizer to share! Crispy Wrappers Filled with Spiced Chicken. Served with Cilantro Dipping Sauce. Three samosas per serving. Super delicious.  Spicy chipotle chicken pasta: Honey Glazed Chicken, Asparagus, Red and Yellow Peppers, Peas, Garlic and Onion in a Spicy Chipotle Parmesan Cream Sauce. If you ask them to make it even spicier, they throw in lots of crushed chili pepper for extra heat. The sauce tastes AMAZING! They are over generous with amount of pasta but don't put enough chicken to balance out the dish. Despite the shortage of protein, I can't stop ordering this dish.  Seared tuna Tataki salad: Fresh Ahi Lightly Seared and Served Rare with Avocado, Tomato and Mixed Greens. Tossed with Wasabi Vinaigrette. They do a great job of not over searing the tuna which seems to be the case often at other restaurants. It's always consistency good.  Fresh strawberry cheesecake: Creamy Cheesecake with a Graham Cracker Crust and Sour Cream Topping served with a deliciously sweet and tart strawberry sauce and fresh strawberries.  The Rancho location inside Victoria Gardens is beautiful with parking right in front of the restaurant."
Nelson N.,"Apple Valley, CA",14,35,88,5.0,3/22/2017,"Been here many times and I really never got the chance to review it. So here is my check in review for my recent visit.  I would like to commend our waitress named Marina D. for an excellent service. She made the whole experience more of a reason to keep coming back, as well as the food here. There are a variety of food to choose from Mexican food, to sea food, and traditional. I really can't say you I have just one favorite because they are all tasteful and wonderfully made. The portions are quite fulfilling. The price is affordable. I highly recommend Cheesecake Factory."
Lindsay D.,"Azusa, CA",85,211,377,5.0,8/23/2017,Love the bread and food here.  The Beet and Goat cheese salad good and refreshing.  I tried the mushroom soup heavenly taste with tons of mushrooms and some carrots perfect with bread.
Michelle F.,"Revere, MA",0,69,7,3.0,7/23/2017,This review is for their bakery only.  Checked online for whole cheesecake prices and for a 7in plain original was $16.95 but when I paid at the register is was $26.95  Wow!! A $10 difference is a lot.  Update your prices online please.
Tiffany N.,"Arcadia, CA",651,473,691,5.0,6/19/2017,"OH MY GOODNESS. I had never seen or ordered a full cheesecake from The Cheesecake Factory before! I AM MISSING OUT IN LIFE!!!! I've been to so many Cheesecake Factories but I've always only ordered slices of them. Their cakes are so beautiful and taste amazing! Well, they have cheesecake in their business name so I'm glad their cheesecakes are the best! I wish I had taken photos of the cake. I had a huge slice of their moist and delicious strawberry cheesecake and I am craving for more! (They had real strawberries as toppings also!) My bf's sister ordered the cheesecake for my bf's younger sister's graduation party, around $25 and serves 6-8 people. They even wrote ""CONGRATULATIONS NANCY UCLA"" on the chocolate. The packaging was beautifully wrapped, and when you open the box, there's tissue paper all around so it doesn't get messy. I really liked that they separately boxed up the congrats chocolate so it wouldn't break... not a lot of places do this.  PERFECTION. I will from now on purchase my cheesecakes at The Cheesecake Factory haha :)"
Jasmine P.,"Long Beach, CA",21,72,79,4.0,8/20/2017,"Came here on a Sunday around 2 for a table of 4. Got seating right away! I ordered the Truffle Honey Chicken with mashed potatoes and asparagus and cucumber lemonade! It was delicious and the lemonade was on this super sweet side. Overall, great service!"
Danya D.,"Duarte, CA",1,9,2,1.0,1/7/2018,"I was very disappointed with my experience tonight. I came with my three kids because I wanted to give them a small treat before going back to school. There was a 45 minute wait, which is not very pleasant but understanding when they are trying to accommodate a big crowd. Then after I received my food, the shrimp was over cooked and the plate looked and tasted almost like a microwave dinner. I didn't think it was necessary to pay $20 for this so they offered to bring me another plate, but I ordered something different. I asked them to put it in a to go box because I was with three kids and they were already getting really impatient. When I got the bill I was disappointed because they didn't try to compensate for ruining my experience. When I asked to speak to the manager they offered me a piece of cheesecake, but I didn't want cheesecake.  I felt that they could have done more to resolve this issue."
