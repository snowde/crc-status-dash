Michelle H.,"Los Angeles, CA",766,219,325,4.0,1/2/2013,"Went for happy hour! M-F 4-6 I believe. Got stella on tap, which was only 4 dollars. But honestly, it didn't taste like Stella Artois.  I ordered the fried artchioke hearts & crab and cheese wontons. SO good. I loved the garlic aioli that the aritchoke hearts came with. So good. And the crab&cheese wontons were so amazing and so plentiful, it was def worth the 5 dollars.  I don't really like cheesecake factory, but I would def come back for the happy hour. Great service!"
Judt A.,"Glendora, CA",0,15,2,5.0,6/27/2016,So good it was the best Cheesecake Factory I've had so far I'm a big fan of the chicken madera loved it  totally recommend a little wait but totally worth it!
Jessica B.,"Northridge, Los Angeles, CA",448,83,48,5.0,2/13/2012,"two words: Chicken Bellagio  The most heavenly pesto pasta ever known to man is made at the Cheesecake Factory. It never fails to throw a party in my tummy. Ignore the 1000 some calories it contains and enjoy the dish, along with warm free bread, and sophisticated ambiance."
Irving B.,"Ontario, CA",18,28,247,5.0,4/11/2015,"My first time to the cheese cake Factory at Victoria Garden's. Checked in was told wait would be about an hour, asked to check back in 15 minutes so took a walk around the Garden. Returned and was given a pager and was paged. Total wait time 40 minutes. Needless to say I'm already happy.  We we're seated outside it was a lil cold out side but the warmers were on. We started off with drinks my wife had a ""Sex on the beach"" while I tried my first Mai Tai which was not a Mai Tai but another drink the server realized her mistake and brought me the real deal and was very apologetic, I honestly would not have known the difference since I never had the drink before. I'm writing this as we are waiting on our food and I finished both drinks and am starting to feel relaxed, time for another Mai Tai. Food was great!!! Hailey  was great!!!!"
Jerome L.,"Los Angeles, CA",337,249,114,5.0,1/30/2014,"Park in the structure by Food Hall. This place is awesome. We were quoted an hour wait and were seated within 30 minutes. Samantha provided excellent service and was always quick to check on us without being annoying. I mean, she never stopped by when I had a mouth full of food and embarrassed me. She must have had a keen eye for that. The food was delicious as always in a Cheesecake Factory. The interior was slightly dim at night but I think that's just a CF thing to make it ""romantic"" or something. Anyways, great food, great service from Samantha and I didn't even think twice about the 30% tip."
Mel B.,"Chino Hills, CA",15,90,7,3.0,1/14/2014,"I really don't like chain restaurants but it's where my family wanted to have lunch. So the name is called Cheesecake Factory, so why go here for anything else?  They serve real food but would you go to Taco Bell and get a hamburger? Probably not. With that said I love their cheesecake.  Their key lime is the best!! I use to live in Florida and it's just as good as key lime there.  It's the only cheesecake I will eat! Very delish. Now with their real food.  Honestly, their food taste like it came out of a microwave.  What I ordered was a turkey sandwich and it came with salad and fries.  Can't really mess that up, but I asked for mustard and they forgot tot add the mustard.  But over all it was ok. What tasted like it was out of a microwave was my moms pasta dish... It was pretty gross.   Oh yeah our server had a really bad attitude.  I felt bad for the lady who sat behind us because she was sitting by herself and it took 20mins for the server to finally acknowledge her."
Mark H.,"Tustin, CA",362,64,28,3.0,2/7/2014,"Entertainment with our meal.  A group of ladies seated across from us were celebrating two Birthdays.  They were all drinking, wearing crazy hats, very loud and extremely disruptive.  What surprised us and others was when they began Twerking the young man clearing the table.   A clear case of workplace harassment, the Cheesecake Factory manager overlooked the behavior despite passing by several times and allowed them to drink their hearts silly."
Thomas M.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,7,14,5.0,10/25/2015,We really enjoy coming here! They have a huge tasty menu with lots of choices and healthy things too! They always accommodate us with substitutions. The servers are polite and go out of their way make it a nice dining experience for us. It's one of our favorite restaurants! The manager is super nice too! I've never had a bad meal here.
Ronald W.,"Sparks, NV",0,39,,1.0,6/4/2016,"Horrible horrible horrible experience!  The  management is seriously challenged.  They are irresponsible, unprofessional and lack intelligence especially at solving issues they cause.  Reporting you to health and safety.  Ruined our birthday dinner and the food was not fully cooked.  Horrible.  Many other choices available at this location than to suffer thru their shit again."
I B.,"Corona, CA",72,127,96,1.0,3/19/2015,"I got my usual dish chicken piccata tonight and the entree came literally dry with hardly any sauce.  I even squeezed in the juice of 7-8 lemon wedges, took 1 bite, and it just didn't make any difference.  So when I finally was able to get my waitress attention to ask for extra sauce, the waitress came back with a small dish of ice cold sauce.  So when I flagged her down again to let her know that the sauce she gave me was cold, it took another approx 8-10minutes before I got the heated up sauce.  By this time, my food has gotten cold so the warm sauce was not hot enough to make my supposedly hot entree to even luke warm temperature.  When the manager came to ask if they may remake my entree for me (mind you the kitchen has already closed), I wouldn't even think to order something else, because my appetite was ruined at this point.  Then to top it all off, the waitress told us that the restaurant disposed all their ice tea after this incident, so when my companion's ice tea needed refilling, the restaurant  didn't have any tea on hand to offer him.  What the heck???!!!   Oh yes, we had paid for the one meal my companion had consumed plus the iced tea which they could not refill.  The only thing the manager did for our ruin dining experience was he gave my companion one slice of cheesecake.   I am REALLY disappointed with this Cheesecake Factory location.  The manager present tonight must have been dozing during his shift.  I dine out at sit down restaurants (no fast food) almost at every meal; I guess this is a location I will not be a return patron in the future."
Lauren X.,"Los Angeles, CA",189,365,514,5.0,1/7/2015,Parking easy and food is the same as in all places. It doesn't feel as fancy as the one in brea...maybe cuz it's at corner and feels congested when there's alot of parking (valet) in front of you and long wait lines.  Other than that you cannot go wrong with good huge portion food.
Luis L.,"Fontana, CA",30,256,74,5.0,4/20/2014,"William D was our waiter. He was great. He was punctual, informative, real (not the fake nice), and he was quick with our drinks and appetizers. Compliments to the chef who made my spicy chicken katzu. It was delicious. I would highly recommend it to anyone. Great flavor, textures and presentation."
Chynna C.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",228,38,3,1.0,9/21/2013,"I came here to buy a gift card for a cousin's birthday. The guy at the take out counter ran my card twice and said both times that it got declined. When I looked through my transactions online and realized that both $25 transactions went through, I calmly went to the counter and asked for my refund, presenting the processed transactions to both the manager and the counter guy.  I was LIVID when I was told that I couldn't get refunded when I had obvious proof. I argued for half an hour with the manager who basically tried to revert the conversation back to how banks and transactions work. Uhhh, HELLO? I didn't come back for a lesson on how banks work; I want my $50 back!  Horrible service from the manager, the least accommodating person in that restaurant. How ironic."
Van D.,"Upland, CA",729,1183,9365,4.0,9/10/2011,"this review is for lunch time, after the lunch crowd, and before the dinner prices :) + service awesome!! i like to go in when it's not busy so they tend to me needys perfectly :)  +/- price  well i always get lunch portions so it always a good price :) but i admit, the dinner menu is a bit expensive + atmosphere i love it!! i like the dimmed lighting and romantic-like atmosphere. there's something soothing to it!! but im sure this is a matter of preference + food i love pasta!!!! so yeah, i love this place ;) + desserts absolutely delicious!! i always try to save room for dessert. although i suck at that!! it's kinda pricey for a slice, but who cares.. .. if you want it, you want it.. the thing i love most (and the pictures i attached) is their annual thing were cheesecakes are $1.50 each!! freaken awesome deal!!!!!!!! makes me so happy, i go every year"
Czarina C.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",73,5,5,5.0,12/30/2013,"I usually always order the chicken piccata pasta. It never fails me.  For dessert, I usually order the fresh strawberry cheesecake or the strawberry shortcake.  The service here is great. Mathew Magno served our table last time and he went above and beyond to make sure our experience was the best. He's awesome(and great to look at)!"
Kellie M.,"Claremont, CA",40,71,3,4.0,1/24/2015,The Cheesecake factor consistently delivers good service and food. It is located on the North -West corner of Victoria Gardens with easy access to parking . As you enter take note of the yummy cheesecakes displayed for your temptation!
Wendy M.,"Oceanside, CA",20,50,209,4.0,4/20/2014,"Obviously the cheesecakes are the reason people go to The C. Factory! But I would rate the food a 7.5 out of 10. Not bad,  considering you went there for the cheesecakes! The meals are huge, and the wait staff are good."
Rubi A.,"Covina, CA",20,11,3,1.0,5/28/2015,Plain & simple poor service & poor food! Consider this my tater tots tasted like the bottom of fries that u get from Mc Donald's. Even if they did give me a gift card would never ever come back!
Sarah K.,"Jersey City, NJ",39,62,23,4.0,3/25/2014,"I only get the Louisiana Chicken Pasta here so my review is just for this dish. I first tried this item many years ago because the waiter recommended it.  It has a hint of spiciness to it and I just love the flavor of the sauce. The chicken is also fried well so that the exterior breaded part is crispy and crunchy and the inside with the meat is tender and juicy. I have tried other items on the menu like the Navajo Sandwich (which was pretty good too) and the Bellagio, but the Louisiana Chicken Pasta has so far been the best in my opinion. If you haven't tried it yet, you should definitely try it out!"
