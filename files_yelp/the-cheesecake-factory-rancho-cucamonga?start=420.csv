Phantom A.,"San Bernardino, CA",13,95,200,4.0,3/24/2014,"Cheesecake factory was pretty good. I ordered a chicken pasta plate, it was OK but check out this meat loaf my wife ordered. Best I've ever tasted and I never order loaf. Inspires me to try and duplicate. Of course we tried the cheesecake... good stuff!"
Tiffany P.,"Monterey Park, CA",299,640,47,3.0,8/24/2013,"Kid-friendly, which is pretty important to me, especially after a day of shopping at VG.  I like that you have the option of keeping your stroller nearby, as most places have you park it out of sight (and possibly in the hands of someone else). My tot is always given bread slices and bananas to keep her busy til our order arrives.  The kids menu also has a decent selection of typical kid-fare (sliders, grilled cheese, chicken nuggets, etc.). Even though I'm not a fan of chain restaurants, Cheesecake's vast and almost random menu keeps me coming back.  Everyone can find something they like. The fish and chips are pretty darn good here.  Not overly oil and a pretty huge portion (to share). The staff is pretty friendly here, which is always nice."
Chris S.,"Highland, CA",0,11,,5.0,9/8/2015,"Cant beat the food. Prices a little high, but the food is worth it. Service was great the girl took real good care of us. Even threw in some bread for free in our take home bag. I wish I could afford to eat here every day! A go to for special occasions for sure!"
T T.,"Corona, CA",2,73,118,1.0,4/24/2015,So we have been checked in for a party of 9 now for at least an hour prior to a big rush behind us. We were told we would have to wait 2 hours. What a joke we have seen them seat parties if 4-6 like nothing. Went to ask what is the status and why not just hold a table of two separate tables. Their response was not very smart. According to them they have specific tables for larger parties specifically. I believe that is the worst seating organization. We could have been seated a long time ago. That's why u suggested they have a reservation system for larger parties as they put it!!!!! I DO NOT Recommend this place for larger parties.
Jerry S.,"Glendora, CA",44,59,1,3.0,10/8/2014,"I have been to a hand full of Cheesecake Factory restaurants. Their food is consistently the same. They have a very dynamic and large varity of choices on the menu. If I had reviewed this resataraunt a few years ago I would have given it a 4. We went to this particular location recently for my wifes birthday. I had not been to a Cheesecake Factory in quite some time. A couple of my favorite dished are the Chicken Costoletta and the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp. The service at this location was just average, It seemed like they were under staffed which made our wait times longer than usual. Their drink prices (which they don't put on the menu) are outrageous. One thing I noticed this time is that the portions seemed to have decreased. One of the things I like about Cheesecake Factory is that I always left with practically a whole other meal to take home as leftovers (which offset the higher prices for the meals.) Not this time though. Although I could not quite finish my meal, there was not quite enough left to justify bothering to take it home. I almost always order the Chicken Costoletta and in the past ended up taking almost half of it home. The other people that were with me noticed a change in the portions in their meals also.  So it appears they have smaller portions for the same prices.  I do like their food though and for that reason I would return but not as often as I would want because of the prices."
Mary S.,"Indio, CA",6,56,31,4.0,1/5/2014,Another great experience at Cheesecake Factory. Love the skinnylicious burger and low cal balsamic dressing. Love the newly added covered patio.
Delfina S.,"Fontana, CA",0,42,1,5.0,5/16/2015,"Pineapple mojitos, Ahi Carpaccio, Dynamite Shrimp and bread...mmmmm!"
Y B.,"West Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",11,10,2,5.0,6/7/2015,Abs love the spicy cashew chicken!!! Def recommend that dish! Also the sweet bread that they bring out at the beginning of your meal is amazing!
Di H.,"Apple Valley, CA",22,29,,2.0,11/6/2015,"This was our 2nd visit to this particular Cheesecake Factory.  The first visit was great.  Ali was our waiter, very personable.  Second visit is the reason I'll never visit Cheesecake Factory again.  Food took forever to be served (and it was well after the lunch hour and before the dinner hour).  Our waitress was never to be seen even when it was time to bring our bill, she had the busser bring the bill.  We waited for 10 minutes for her to pick up the bill (we always pay cash) and she never showed up so we left with the paid bill on the table (we ate on the patio).  The food was below adequate in taste and in warmth.  Interesting enough my husband and I both had different breakfast items but we were both ill that night hmmmmmm.  Our usual tip is 20% this waitress did not receive that amount."
Imran N.,"Los Angeles, CA",12,105,14,2.0,1/13/2015,"I came to Rancho for New Years Day, thinking I could get some lunch quickly and pay, now as I walked in through the door, I was greeted with a crowd overwhelmingly sure, I made my way to the register, said my name was Lucifer, they looked at me like I was joking, I said ""Please, I need to get cracking..."", ""...Can I order Spicy Chipotle Pasta, on my card so I can go back to mi casa"", it was so delicious that I couldn't resist, the temptations led me back to ""I couldn't resist"", this time I ordered Chocolate Tower Truffle Cake, at the curb side I wait, this is why I gave two stars, because I got a small piece and no change so far..."
Dave K.,"Victorville, CA",63,5,,1.0,8/9/2015,Bad service. 1st one in the restaurant and had to wait on a table. When I brought it to the managers attention he only had excuses. Food was expensive and wasn't that good
JJ M.,"Corona, CA",0,182,14,4.0,4/18/2015,"Stopped in tonight for an early dinner they were jam packed. Food was very good. A couple of snags in the service. I think our server had too many tables. She was busting her buns. She was very nice which made up for a little snag here and there. The menu has many options, however a little pricy. I guess that is due to minimum wage going up. Thank you Jerry Brown you horse's behind. We will return and I will recommend."
Dejah A.,"Rialto, CA",2,63,15,1.0,2/28/2016,"Today I went with my family to this location for dessert. We came in and received this little device telling us when our table is ready. Well the device went off about 10 minutes after we received it. We went to the front area to return it to the hostess. We waited about 5 more minutes till someone escorted us to our table. Only problem is a family came and sat at our table already. The hostess did nothing about it, allowing them to just come in and seat themselves without waiting. Whatever, I just wanted to be seated so we could order our food. So we get back to the front and the other hostess said sorry guys you have to wait 15 more minutes. I was upset and said its ok I'm just goin to leave. They said ok and didn't even try to make right about wasting our time. I went to the area in front to order cheesecake to go. Already agitated, the cashier kept rushing me asking every 20 seconds if I'm ready to order. The only reason why I have them one star was because the cheesecake was good but other than that I will not return to this location."
Esmeralda S.,"West Covina, CA",4,22,,5.0,4/13/2015,"First time ever to this location & first time trying Cheesecake Factory! It was very tasty & very great service. Didn't get to try any of the deserts because I was so stuffed! Tried the fried zucchini and it was AMAZING , so was the guacamole & chips. Overall very great experience!"
Blog S.,"Santa Clarita, CA",5,40,3,5.0,11/18/2013,"Classy, professional , courteous and delicious!   Whenever someone asks me where I want to go eat, this restaurant is usually my answer Why? Because it's local and  the food and service are second to none CF has a menu like a book that offers a wide variety of yummy cuisine regardless of where you're from or what your taste buds are used to.  The food is absolutely luscious and wonderful. It's a tad overpriced perhaps. But boy, they know what they are doing here. They really do. The service is always prompt, waiters are nice , attractive and energetic and the place is lively. They refill your water as expected and you never have to flag a waiter down. Oh, and they don't run out of stuff. If you are sitting outside, they don't forget about you, and you get the same five star service as if you are sitting inside. Don't worry if it's cold, they have kerosene tower heaters.. The desserts and dessert bar are very expensive. I think I saw a whole cake there for $50. By the slice it is around $7.00 or more Noise level can be quite loud depending on what time you go there. The décor is Ritz Carlton nouveau riche to a degree but still inviting and not imposing This restaurant chain should give the others lessons Wait times can be somewhat long, but that is expected when it is a busy time for them. Tip: If it is busy, opt to sit in outside dining area. Seating turnover is usually faster out there. I am not really sure why  I'm being a little bit generous with my five star. Perhaps it's really a four star place, but I like them so..."
Summer S.,"Los Angeles, CA",54,681,3,4.0,7/20/2013,"Quite impressed by this location. Came with a good friend and was seated promptly. The ladies in the front were nice. Waitress started off quiet/cold/or was thinking about something? but eventually got really friendly... Food was good, ordered off the lunch special menu. I swear, I can have their Fettucine Alfredo w/ Chicken and Sun-Dried tomatoes for DAYS. it was that good! And my friend ordered a salad that she munched on quite happily. This place is also clean too. I will be back. :)"
Jess D.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,15,,1.0,5/10/2015,"Been here several times, but today was the worst experience at check in.  Our pager buzzed so we walked up to reception and told as to wait on the side.  Other customers who came after us started to come up and wait alongside with us.  One customer was seated who came in after we did so thought that was weird that they were seated before us.  We didn't worry about too much until 5-6 customers who came after we came in were being seated.  I went up to the hostess and asked them politely why people were who came after us being seated. She said that we were next.  After 3 more customers were seated was when I got really upset.  I then told them that it was ridiculous that we were passed up several times and that I was very disappointed with their process and that we were leaving.  They didn't care much.  So I do not recommend their customer service. Worst experience ever!"
Deb T.,"Pasadena, CA",343,647,73,2.0,11/27/2013,"I love the Cheesecake Factory, but I didn't enjoy my experience at this location. I don't know if there weren't enough servers, or it was just that busy, but the floors were filthy! I had to tell my mom to be careful because the tile was slippery. We were also seated next to an obnoxious group of drunk people, but, that is always inevitable. The food was amazing (we ordered the giant monster of a burrito) and the Spinach and Cheese Dip. Our server did wait on us the best she could since it was the end of her shift, but her replacement wasn't as efficient as she was. We were satisfied with out food, but I was just taken aback by the disgusting floors."
Aimee S.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",1,18,5,5.0,6/6/2015,"Great food and great waitress I think her name was Jennifer , so helpful sweet and nice !"
Steve M.,"Fontana, CA",0,46,7,1.0,4/2/2015,"Walked in and was offered inside seating with a 15 minute wait or outside seating, no wait. Was told outside seating was heated so we opted for that. Outside temperature was about 63*  Upon being sat, we noticed the heater was not on. the waiter took our order, at which time we asked if he could turn the heater on. He replied, that he'd get someone to turn it on.  When our drinks came about 10 minutes later, they were delivered by a female. We asked her to turn the heater on. She said ok and walked away.  Our appetizers were delivered by the manager, about 20 minutes later. We asked him to turn the heater on. His reply? ""Let me get it turned on for you!"" And he walked away... About 40minutes after we've sat, still no heat.. By this time I told my wife, that we should just cut our losses, leave and go to lucilles..  Dinner comes and I again ask our server about the heater.. He gives me a  disgusted look and walks away... I finally get up and start fumbling with it myself... A busboy walks over finally gets it turned on... Our nachos were good but entree (bbq) chicken pizza was flavorless... should have just left and went somewhere else..."
