Tanya T.,"Los Angeles, CA",12,15,2,1.0,8/17/2014,"OMG! The server, Carly, actually rolled her eyes when she walked away from our table, once she had her tip in hand. She approached with a slight edge when we first sat down and her attitude never improved. She either has an attitude in general or she wasn't interested in serving a table of black customers. I know, not the race card, but there was no reason to approach us with an attitude. Bad day maybe? But another server also came to the table with a rude tude. I hate service like that. I tried to ignore it but others in my party were not happy about it. The food was ok. I've eaten at the Cheesecake Factory for years, various locations and have never had any issues. A couple of the orders were incorrect and had to be sent back. We had a good time because of our party, in spite of the crappy service!"
Ruben H.,"Claremont, CA",69,38,7,1.0,3/20/2015,"If you really want to deal with some really simple minded hostess crews, then come here. Apparently they don't know how to deal with parties of 8. Putting two tables of,4 is much too complicated for then. They only have 1 table of 8 that they think is funny to make people wait 2 hours. Manager was nowhere to be found. Corporate is definitely getting an email."
Vincent G.,"Victorville, CA",0,6,,1.0,11/9/2015,"This review is specifically for the Reservation process. Online and on Yelp it says this location takes reservations which technically is true but only if you call right as they open and plan to have your party there within that opening hour. So basically this location DOES NOT take reservations, don't be fooled people. Walk ins only and the size of your party doesn't matter, I asked. Just an FYI for anyone planning to try and book a special event in advance, they WILL NOT accommodate you."
Teresa B.,"Fontana, CA",1,5,,5.0,6/23/2015,"Our service was amazing. The bartender went above and beyond to make us happy and satisfied. I don't know her name, but she's the only female bartender here, young and beautiful."
Nakita D.,"Los Angeles, CA",313,264,96,4.0,2/19/2013,"It's a chain, and usually people who go here are looking for something to satisfy everyone in their group.  I was here for a work outing and it was pleasant.  The location next to the shops certainly helps.  It was clean, as were the bathrooms.  They had these crazy sinks..... The only complaint is that they give you way too much food, and that the cakes are frozen.   Staff was very nice and accommodating and prices are average to high."
Jennifer M.,"Fontana, CA",110,28,26,5.0,1/11/2016,"Let me start by saying I have never been disappointed with my experience at any CCF. I usually go with some friends during happy hour to catch up and we all share food; without drinking I can walk away full for under $15 including the tip. The nachos and southwest egg rolls are my two favorites. But to be honest, everything I have tried was delicious. And by the way... Don't forget to visit for national cheesecake day for a free slice!!"
Heather H.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",23,31,115,2.0,8/22/2014,"Okay, I love love love the Cheesecake Factory, but not he Victoria Gardens one. I have been to this one many many times over the years. My last time there was a bad experience.  I was on the phone while our Avocado eggrolls arrived at the table. My husband was first to dig up. I watched him eat as I was on the phone. He dipped it in the sauce and pulled back and low and behold, a long black HAIR came out with it. OMG I had a heart attack.  A HAIR WAS IN OUR FOOD!!! I dont know about anybody else, I do definitely do not take this lightly. I calmly waited for the waitress to come back to the table. We informed her of the hair, and not trying to be grossed out, accepted her offer to replace it. But She didn't even off an apology or anything. She looked at me like I was crazy. We got the new one and hesitantly ate it. My husband was trying to keep me calm and not to throw up. I waited for a manager or the waitress to come back and talk to us about it and apologize, but nothing. I finally asked the waitress if we can speak with the manager. She said yeah she'll get her. The manager came over and apologized finally and said she would take it off the bill. UH, you should comp our whole bill as I was ready to walk out. Later, the manager came back and thought she'd let us know that ""it was just a string from a rag they use to wipe down the counters, and not a hair."" OH LIKE THAT""S ANY BETTER! Can we say Salmonella or Ebolli?  UGH, I don't think I will go back to this one again.  PS* - The food is usually always tasty, but Service and find hair in your food is a high possibilty. Two of my coworkers had similar experiences at this location (HAIR IN THEIR FOOD)!!!"
Dennis L.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",2,27,,2.0,2/21/2015,"busy with long waits, dirty tables, greasy plates, bent forks and way overpriced. Food was decent but could not get passed the gross feel of utensils and plates."
Ce Cee G.,"Rialto, CA",0,8,,2.0,3/27/2016,"Just dropped in to grab a cheesecake for my son's bday. The cashier that helped at the counter was horrible, bad attitude. I don't eat cakes or cheese for that matter so I was trying to. Find out how many slices came with each size. The girl was so rude that I had to ask for the manager. But lucky for me a guy behind the counter jumped in and helped us and did get the manager. I know the family will enjoy the cheesecake but this will be the last visit for me"
Ji O.,"Upland, CA",1581,793,2894,3.0,4/21/2011,love their tiramitsu cheesecake!!!  very delicious!!  the food is okay!!! little over priced!!  try to avoid weekends.. they tend to get crowded!!
Fidel T.,"Pomona, CA",26,51,133,5.0,4/23/2015,Me and my boyfriend came here for some delicious cheesecake after pieology. He demanded it. I got some carrot cake cheesecake and he got a wild blueberry one. Both were BEYOND DELICIOUS and a good about of slice for their expensive price! The waitress was cool and brought us bread too. Service was good and no wait time on Wednesday night! Cheesecake factory deserves 5 stars just for their food! I wish it wasn't so expensive though... Just sayin
Xandrea G.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",276,145,9,5.0,1/23/2015,"Love this place : ) always crowded because it is so good. Great for girls night out, family night , or date night. The dishes are big so fun to share. I love Vegetable Salad and Farfalle pasta. All the cheesecakes are good but the black out cake will knock your socks off. Great happy hour menu for food and drinks. Be prepared to wait."
Theodore S.,"Los Angeles, CA",58,58,69,1.0,8/16/2014,Horrible service plus my order was wrong and Carley C has a nasty attitude. And the wait time to be seated was long 40 mins
Sarah C.,"Lake Havasu City, AZ",22,21,27,4.0,2/13/2014,"Love the cheese cake factory!!! For a chain restaurant they really keep it non chain feeling... We get consistency with the it's not the same old thing feeling.  One day I will start with dessert first, I never have enough room to finish my meal yet have what looks delish when you walk  in to door!!!  CHEESE CAKE!!"
Christopher B.,"Moreno Valley, CA",2,1,,1.0,4/19/2015,"Was told 20 min wait, took almost an hour.  Silverware was very dirty, we didn't get the bread until after our food was out.  But the food was really good."
Joel H.,"Ontario, CA",0,7,,5.0,2/28/2016,"The chicken Madeira is excellent . The chicken was perfectly grilled and smothered in cheese . Along with red buttery mashed potatoes and freshly cooked asparagus . Some of the best food I have ever eaten . I Didn't like the pagan god decorations  , but the food was really good ."
N K.,"Chino, CA",0,13,1,3.0,4/12/2014,Food was ok. Large portion.  Dishes and utensils were dirty.  Service was actually great. Ive been here many time and service sucks. They have improved a lot.
Paul R.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",66,328,272,4.0,12/23/2014,Always dependable for good comfort food with large portions. It was nice to be able to bring the dog on the patio as well - they were very nice about it. I had the lemon garlic shrimp pasta and it was fantastic. Very flavorful.
J C.,"El Monte, CA",2,10,,5.0,8/14/2014,Love this place the food is great.  The steak Diane is awesome. My family and I always love coming here for our birthdays. The kids get excited every time they sing happy bday to them.
Angel H.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",56,37,2,5.0,5/21/2013,"I love Cheesecake Factory.  My favorite is Miso Salmon, and I always substitute rice with mashed potato.  So far everything we have ordered there are good."
