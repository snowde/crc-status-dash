Megan M.,"Fontana, CA",3,5,1,1.0,10/16/2014,"I'd give them less then one star if I could... Togo order was all wrong had to remake half of it so then the other half got cold. The order took over an hour to complete on a slow night. Worst management I've ever dealt with! Use to order here once in a while when I didn't want to cook... not anymore... over priced, under quality food and staff... pass!!"
Michel C.,"Ontario, CA",66,20,2,1.0,12/17/2014,Sooo was seated at 4:48pm waited until 5:10. Group of girls sitting next to us. Get served in five minutes. They came in after us. We bolted. Horrible.
Valerie M.,"Diamond Bar, CA",355,232,243,4.0,10/30/2010,"It's not always about trying the newest, hippest place out there.. sometimes it's about learning to love the familiar restaurants too! I always liked Cheescake Factory. I've received great service and food quality here. Other than being a huge fan of sushi, I also love pasta! So I come to CF for the Louisiana Chicken Pasta. Definitely my favorite dish! It's got parmesan crusted chicken with mushrooms (!!!!), peppers, onions, and a delicious cajun sauce bedded over farfalle (bow-tie pasta). Mouthwatering? ..You betcha!  Sooo what's for dessert?!  The Ultimate Red Velvet Cheesecake of course! Some say they like it and some say it's overrated but I say who cares what anyone else says..I FREAKING LOVE IT! Can't really say much except that it's a party in my mouth. Brownie points to my gf's new beau for bringing us a full-sized surprise.. best tip for any guy trying to impress his gf's friends.. CF's Red Velvet FTW! FYI: Lunch specials include this dish for a cheaper price and it comes in a good-sized portion."
M M.,"Upland, CA",0,3,,3.0,3/6/2016,"Rancho location has gone downhill. Asked NOT to be seated outside, we were seated outside. It started to rain, we had to rush inside and find somewhere to sit. Service is REALLY slow."
Marilyn S.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,16,,4.0,9/5/2016,"As most of you know, this is a great place to eat. Excellent food and menu. Unfortunately they have one serious problem that I have now experienced twice. Several of my friends have had the same experience. I always take my leftovers home to enjoy the next evening. I am lazy so I have the server pack them up for me. Two times now I have ended up with food that did not come from my plate! This is disgusting and lacks an excuse. One time I ended up with a partially eaten dessert that I hadn't ordered. Nor had anyone at my table. Last Tuesday I ended up with 3 times the potatoes that originally accompanied my dinner. I hate to imagine who's plate or plates they came from. It certainly wasn't mine. I was warned by a friend at my table not to let the servers package my food as she had the same problem at an earlier visit. I didn't listen. It was a hard lesson to learn but never will I let the servers at the Factory pack up another leftover. Shame on them. Wake up management! Caveat Emptor!"
Rasheeda B.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",1,6,3,3.0,9/30/2014,I love this place but every time I come in and order my favorite dessert the strawberry shortcake it's either a 45 minute wait or their all out of biscuits. I could see if I came in at 10:50 but not at 4 or 6 in the evening.
Chynna L.,"Claremont, CA",9,7,,4.0,4/22/2015,This Cheese Cake Factory was amazing! I was seated less than 5 minutes also I really enjoyed the server who was polite and did not rush. I also enjoyed the four cheese pasta which I recommend!
Master Yoda Fisherman F.,"Fontana, CA",0,7,,1.0,6/10/2015,This location I would not recommend. When we were first seated out host was very inpatient with us rolling his eyes at us waiting for my daughter to sit in. The next worst part was our waitress coming up to us not introducing her self or even saying hi. All she said were we ready to order. The kicker was when we were ready to pay our waitress ended up charging my card for someone else's table. Then she got the manager over and not even a sorry she was very rude and not apologetic. She wanted me to pay my bill before she would fix it . Now at this point my card was charged twice for my meal and someone else's meal.  The next part was the worst. Before she would refund me the wrong tables charge she told me I had to wait until the other table was finished before she would fix their error. This is unacceptable for such a large corporate restaurant.
J L.,"Pomona, CA",14,36,60,3.0,9/17/2014,Had lunch with  an old friend here. Decided to have a Ghirardelli chocolate martini $13.50 was not impressed at all it tasted like a chocolate slushy. Next I ordered their shrimp spring roll appetizer $10.50 2 rolls cut into halves which me and my friend shared. For my entree I ordered their skinny chicken tacos  $11.50 and to top it off we decided to order a turtle dove slice of cheesecake to share $7.50. The food was not the greatest... I mean for the price the service however was excellent! I don't think this is the place for me.  I've had better drinks and appetizers at local bars and for half the price.  Our bill came out to $69 and we were still hungry when we left.
Diego S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,1.0,7/27/2014,Our wait was expected at 25-30 minutes and we ended up waiting for an extra half an hour. Everyone who came in was seated and we sat patiently but soon became angry. I would not recommend this location for a busy day. Service is horrendous.
Bradd F.,"Las Vegas, NV",299,295,172,4.0,6/15/2013,"I am always pleasantly surprised that anytime I go to Cheescake factory, I really like the food.   lately, I have been hooked on their lite Asian lettuce wraps.  They are so fresh and lite.  They come with 2 unique sauces, that when mixed together really pop in flavor.   So good."
Will V.,"Fontana, CA",18,15,9,5.0,11/2/2014,"Belgium waffles is the way to go the are perfect, hot chocolate to bring in the new time change"
Sandra B.,"San Bernardino, CA",45,10,1,1.0,8/9/2015,"They want you to put a star for any thing but this rest should not get a star I went for my birthday and thinking  I  was going to get a great dinner I ordered and I told them NO SPICE garlic only  they said OK I got it it, it was so spice I could no eat it  I complained they pretty much said OH WELL  they did nothing to fix it did not even give me a discount  I gave them the food back and told them I will NEVER BE BACK and I haven't"
Jose P.,"Brea, CA",135,31,49,5.0,12/5/2014,Amazing cuisine and endroit! Kevin and Will provided amazing service! Friendly and comfortable atmosphere!
Celina E.,"Menifee, CA",65,55,26,5.0,7/17/2014,"My mom took me to Cheescake factory yesterday for my birthday and Will was our server. I just wanted to drop in and give him a great review, because even though he was very busy he still made sure to take great care of us and make us feel special! I suggest asking for him next time you stop in!"
Susana C.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,15,2,1.0,7/29/2015,"Well the food and actual service deserves a 4.5 star review, but the hostesses killed 3.5 stars. First I get a malfunctioning pager which apparently is my fault. Then oh turns out it real is malfunctioning so sorry we will seat you right away. By right away we mean after we seat four other parties. I guess my understanding of right away is wrong. I know that you are busy given its national cheesecake day but hmm you would think the Cheesecake Factory of all places would be prepared for that. Thank god Marina our server was super nice. The food was great and the manager Gabriel tried to make up for his hostesses. He was in the middle of speaking g with me when another hostess basically told him to move so she could move a table. I guess these hostesses this evening were doing their make up and hair instead of listening in customer service 101. So people beware the inept hostesses at Cheesecake Factory Victoria gardens"
Donte W.,"Fontana, CA",400,13,,5.0,1/27/2015,Love this Cheesecake Factory! Always have great customer service which keeps me coming back. Love their menu because of the variety of food choices. Food always comes out fast when you dine in no matter how busy and even faster if you order over the phone to pick up. 5 Star for sure!!!
Mia L.,"San Diego, CA",578,1138,1507,3.0,4/25/2011,"2.28.11: Alright Cheesecake is like any other place, but on this day I felt like trying something on the menu that I have not had before. So I decided to order their Chipotle Pasta. Lets just say that's why they got the 3 stars. It is not good. ha ha. The service that day was actually pretty good. The guy was on top of things and came back frequent for refills.  Overall this place will probably where I go for late night dining in the IE."
Brent P.,"Riverside, CA",20,10,1,4.0,7/26/2014,"Ever since Claim Jumper has gone downhill, the wife and I have been looking for another ""American style"" cuisine restaurant. Not to good of an experience the first time. Had to send back an overcooked cheeseburger. However, the manger was very prompt in returning to the table with a new one. Second experience was way better. I ordered an appetizer of their buffalo wings...very good. I took a chance and ordered their ribeye steak. DELICIOUS! One of the better steaks I have had in a long time. I highly suggest it. My only complaint is their seating. Too many table's packed close together. I suggest you request a booth and wait an extra 10-15 minutes if you have to."
Michelle H.,"San Diego, CA",84,246,58,5.0,4/23/2013,"Had an excellent evening. I happen to see a free table inside the restaurant at one of the few windows when we were walking up, and asked if we could sit at that table. We had no problems and was sat immediately. Our waitress, Ana was very friendly and attentive even with four tables.  Food was delicious, a must try is the Vietnamese tacos. I had the Monterey burger which was savory and my wife had the spicy Chipotle chicken pasta and it tasted great.  Tried the Asian pear martin it was delicious,  I now want to know how to make it.  Overall, a great experience."
