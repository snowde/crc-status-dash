Zerring J.,"Eglin AFB, FL",51,52,49,4.0,5/27/2014,It was my first time at the Cheesecake Factory. I had the jerk chicken type dish it was very good with a nice spicy kick that's what I like so I was pleased. The service was ok and reasonably priced. I would go again I will like to try other dishes
Celeste T.,"West Jordan, UT",307,130,33,4.0,3/23/2013,"I went there for lunch with a friend and I'm in love with their Renee Special. I got the Chicken-Almond Salad with green salad and fruit. (I didn't like the soup of the day) Everything was the right temperature and tasted fresh. The portions were great and I couldn't even fit in a cheesecake which was my plan. The waitress was a little busy. We were outside on the patio and it was a nice day so there were many guests out there. I was a little irritated that another guest decided to turn off the heater that was next to us. I was a bit cold and wanted it on. Good thing we left right after because that would be another issue and require another review. ;) Overall, I would go back, even if it were just for this."
Rob C.,"Hesperia, CA",10,1,4,2.0,6/14/2012,"Food was awful....order off of the ""skinnylicious"" menu and it was far from that...had the grilled chicken with asparagus and tomoatoe basil, dressing.... Chicken was dry and the asparagus was as hard as bricks. When I complained to the manager she said because I ate some of the meal that she could only replace the asparagus because I ate too much of chicken and should would not take it off of the tab. I ate at another establishment the other night and my friend had overcooked  salmon, not only did they replace the meal...but they took it off of the bill. I will never eat at the Cheese Cake Factory again in Rancho Cucamonga at Victoria Gardens and I recommend that you don't either.!!!!!"
Linette S.,"Ontario, CA",22,18,,3.0,1/27/2016,"Visited yesterday for the first time it was my husband's bday. Did mentioned it to the host and she wrote it down, but at the end waiter did not make it a priority. Food was great the service wasn't all there didn't feel like he wanted our business. I finally said something to make him crack a some what smile. Might try another location for the service."
Rachel N.,"Riverside, CA",16,27,6,1.0,6/1/2015,NEVER AGAIN! you couldn't even pay me to eat at this restaurant again we walked in and was greeted by the hostess it was around 9 pm the restaurant did not seem too busy i saw a lot of open available tables. She informed us that the wait would be a few minutes she did not take our names she just told us we would be seated in a few minutes. 10 minutes passed by and then 15 minutes passed by and then 20 minutes pass by so we go up to the hostess AGAIN and asked what was the long wait for she asked for  the name and we told her you did not ask us for a name when we walked in to check in you told us that we would be seated in a few minutes and she seemed to have  completely forgotten that she had just spoken to us so she rushed us to a table I sat down and  crumbs were all over our seats a busboy rushed over and wiped down the seats. The waitress comes around takes our order and apologizes that no bread is available at the moment and that our bread would be out in a few minutes 5 minutes pass by still no bread 10 minutes passed by still no bread and then 15 minutes passed by then the bread finally comes out and then two minutes after the bread comes out our food comes out...whoever was the manger and the hostess on 5/31/15 around 9 pm should definitely be replaced....AND THE WOMEN'S BATHROOMS WERE SO DIRTY TRASH EVERYWHERE AND NO SEAT COVERS!
Alicia M.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",816,64,7,4.0,6/3/2014,"The food is great have a variety of food and includes a menu for those of us that want to eat healthier. Enjoy coming here, Its a little bit pricey for what they give, and the servers take a while. This will be ideal for a party of 2 but not for a bigger group."
Anthony B.,"Riverside, CA",513,690,483,4.0,8/24/2012,"After a great meal elsewhere in Victoria Gardens, we found ourselves hungry for dessert, which led us here. This is your typical cheesecake factory. Strangely enough it wasn't packed with people and the wait time was a bare minimal (under 5 minutes). We had a great server and overall good experience here."
Kiarra S.,"Riverside, CA",6,45,26,2.0,4/27/2014,"I go to the Cheesecake Factory on Tyler St in Riverside all the time. They have great customer service. This Cheesecake Factory really disappointed me. I had terrible service on my BIRTHDAY,  MY 21ST BIRTHDAY at that. The server was very rude to my friends and I. She definitely made an impression on us. I tell her its my birthday and I asked her opinion on a couple drinks. She didn't bother saying happy birthday. Thats common courtesy. She had a rude tone while telling me what she thought about the drinks. I couldn't believe that was my experience there. The food was awesome though."
Ferdmeister V.,"Beverly Hills, CA",37,135,73,4.0,7/29/2012,"Check the silverware before you dig in at this place!   Despite that, they have great food here though I have to say always be on your guard no matter where you go as you never know when they are going to misfire.  Try the Sunrise Burrito it is almost a foot long and very big!  As always nothing beats the FREE BREAD basket and you can always ask for more .. pumpernickel is my favorite!  The Miso Salmon is my usual order at this place but you can never go wrong with the entire menu ... just check the silverware at all times before you start eating!  The Tiramisu cheesecake is a must before you leave!"
Heather W.,"Ontario, CA",22,21,4,1.0,5/21/2014,"If you have a party of more than 5 be prepared not only for an extra wait but for your table to be given away. Our table for 16 was given away 2 different times to 2 differentparties on 2 occasions in the same night. We didn't leave the restraunt they just got the paties ""confused""  and then said ""sorry"" after we waited more than 2 hours.  I'm over it. This will be the last time we celebrate anything here."
Tony G.,"San Bernardino, CA",1,12,1,5.0,1/20/2015,Very good food & service every time.  Lunch is also great when you're looking to save a few bucks as well.
Christal R.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",1,30,,1.0,1/17/2015,"I should have walked out the door as soon as walked in.  At the reception desk the girl said we'd be seated soon so we didn't need a pager, WRONG.  There were many people after us that were seated first.   Pros: 1. Nice interior/patio 2. Large selection of food 3. Free bread 4. Portion size is big...but (see below) Cons: 1. Chicken romano pasta portion is huge, but where's the chicken??  2 lbs of pasta to a ounce of chicken, and a teaspoon of sauce. Ratio is way off.  Not work the $20 plate.    2. Food bland (ex. Shrimp and Angel Hair, gross) 3. Beer is $8.50 for a 22oz cup 4. Service is meh 5. Seating/reception issues 6. Menu layout isn't user friendly.   Never again.  Overrated, I would only come here if it were free."
Deborah E.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,11,1,5.0,10/20/2014,"This is my favorite anytime. Food is always good, service is exceptional. Always an enjoyable experience."
Mike J.,"Grand Terrace, CA",116,22,36,2.0,3/9/2014,"I went to the Cheese Cake Factory 3/9/14. The wait was 40 minutes long. There were at least 30 people sitting outside also waiting.  I figured if there are this many people it's gotta be good. The inside of the building is big and looks nice. What is the theme of this restaurant?  It has an Egyptian/Mexico style,  I don't get it. They have columns with Egyptian gods at the top, then there are hand painted flowers on the walls with painted pictures on the ceiling. The first complaint is the silverware was filthy, it had oil and food stuck to some of it. The menu is huge, they have everything from steak to pasta to oriental food this makes me think they are good at somethings but not great at anything.  My steak was good it was cooked right that's why they got 2 stars and not one my company was not impressed with their steak and said it wasn't good. We ordered drinks and one of them was a margarita. The margarita came with salt and someone's hair on the rim. We sent it back and they apologized then replaced it, but when I got the check they still charged me for it. Over all it was about $90 for two with drinks, not too bad. The service was good but I don't think it was good enough to get me back anytime soon."
Sugey B.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",285,67,43,5.0,11/18/2014,"I really like all their food, very good portions and delicious freshly baked bread. Super long wait on weekends, but staff is very attentive and kind. Renee's specials is one of my favorites and tuna tartare is delicious!!"
Kevin T.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",35,60,7,4.0,7/29/2014,Always excellent. Great happy hour menu. Great service something for everyone.. always! I love their Sunday brunch as well. Fresh food.
Maurice E.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",26,9,1,5.0,12/24/2014,This place is awesome there always a bit of waiting but it's worth it great service 5star food and my family loves this place keep up the good work and stay always number one place to be
Zina S.,"Glendora, CA",0,9,,5.0,12/23/2014,"It is such wonderful cozy warm atmosphere at cheese cake factory in Victoria gardens, we are going there Tonight to celebrate my brother's birthday with whole family it is such delightful neiberhood and fancy shops that make us enjoy the Christmas spirit in california, and the service is so friendly and fast.. Can't wait to get there tonight's ugh a five star service and food"
Emily K.,"La Habra, CA",12,69,5,3.0,2/20/2013,"My MIL, husby, and I came here for lunch to celebrate their birthdays (same day!) a couple of days ago.  We come here for the cheesecake, of course! Anyway, I ordered the crusted chicken romano, which was good, but not amazing.  The pasta and sauce were really basic, but the crusted chicken was good.  My snickers cheesecake, on the other hand, was delicious!  I will definitely order it again sometime. Our server was fine, as well.  Overall, it was a nice lunch, not amazing and not bad."
Jenn S.,"Torrance, CA",502,633,99,3.0,6/26/2012,"Service at the bar was great and they serve the full menu.  Thai Lettuce Wraps - they give you the ingredients and you create your own wrap. Satay chicken strips, carrots, bean sprouts, noodles and large sturdy lettuce leaves served with three dipping sauces peanut, sweet red chili and tamarind-cashew.  Seared Tuna Tataki Salad - generous portion of seared ahi with a few slices of avocado, large slices of tomatoes and mixed greens tossed with vinaigrette."
