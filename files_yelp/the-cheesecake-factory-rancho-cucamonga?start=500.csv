Cricket R.,"Moreno Valley, CA",1,29,3,4.0,8/26/2012,"Like: taste of food, ambiance, fast service, staff friendly and very knowledgeable and helpful, location (you can choose to eat inside or outside in the patio), kid-friendly Dislike: wait time during peak hours, can be pricey"
denise f.,"Whittier, CA",0,10,,5.0,5/10/2015,"Decided to come her on Mother's Day even though we knew there would be a long wait. Was quoted 2.5 hours! We actually didn't mind because we were able to walk around and kill time. After 1.5 hours we went back to check in and receive a pager, after that the pager went off in less than 5 min. I thought it was a mistake but the host assured me that our table was actually ready. The service was great. Had 2 servers watching over us so they were able to stay on top of everything. Order came out perfect! I liked how our servers checked in on us often and noticed when we needed refills. I also like how our server offered some sliced bananas for my son while our food was being prepared. Great Mother's Day dinner!"
Lupe C.,"San Bernardino, CA",2,66,235,3.0,9/5/2014,"The temperature of my food was between warm and cold, which is not good but my food tasted ok...I believe it would have been better if it was at the right temperature (e.g., between hot and warm). Customer service was good. Another thing I got to say is that the cost for just one slice of cheesecake is a big rip off (more than $7)."
Tracie S.,"Anaheim Hills, CA",455,359,2344,5.0,9/7/2012,"Love coming here for brunch on the weekends..great food, great service. My BF ordered the french toast with a side of bacon and I had the spinach, mushroom, cheese, and bacon omelet which comes with toast and hash browns.  Tons of food, we couldn't finish any of our entrees."
Eric S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,30,,5.0,11/17/2014,"Great Service, friendly staff, ordered a salad and it was out with in min ! We got our food extremely fast considering it was packed ! Highly recommended !"
Joel D.,"South Gate, CA",0,5,,1.0,9/27/2014,Alfredo pasta the worst I have ever had very hard and chewy they took it back brought an other plate again and the same not coming back again service is great thats all I can say
Shelly F.,"Riverside, CA",0,11,,5.0,6/20/2012,Always been a fan of cheesecake factory. The Rancho Cucamonga location is no different. Always busy but service is always excellent. Food quality is outstanding. I really like the healthy options on the menu ( they're there). Portions are very generous and there's usually leftovers to take home.  The menu is very extensive and can get confusing though. If not careful you can easily take in a thousand calories. That doesn't even include desert.  Great place to get together with friends or have an office lunch.
Janine L.,"Apple Valley, CA",12,19,9,4.0,6/21/2014,The service was excellent. It was the end of the night and the staff was still cheery and attentive. Food was just good/ ok nothing fabulous. But good value. Large portion s. It was weird but the floor had a greasy slippery feel to it.  It was late so maybe just end of a busy night needing a scrub.
Breanna S.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",52,82,4,2.0,11/12/2013,"Visited on (11/11/13)  Me and my bf went on our weekend outing to dinner as he works far away and is only home on the weekends/holidays. Despite his desire to eat elsewhere I chose to eat here. There was a small wait... No biggy. We were sat in a very cozy little corner booth and told our server would be over in just a moment. Here 10 minutes later our server came over to us (did not greet us nor leave us her name) and asked us what we would like to drink. She dropped our sodas off a few minutes later, along with bread, and quickly walked away without a word... We were ready to order an appetizer at that point. Another 10 minutes pass and she comes back to ask for our order and I replied to her with ""well we wanted an appetizer but.."" and she interrupted me to say I can take my time she'll just come back... Took our appetizer order down and left. We got the mushroom, zucchini, avocado fries which were amazing BTW!!! She came back about 5 minutes after we had eaten all of our appetizer to take our food order (so who knows how long we waited I lost track enjoying the yummy food!) Only when she came back she had another server with her as she was ""going home"". Tony, yes he told us his name (AND GREETED US), quickly picked up in the areas she was slacking in. He refilled our bread, our drinks and kept on top of his game. While he definitely made a comeback from whom ever the first server was and the food was delicious we did not appreciate the firsts servers attitude nor enjoyed her service."
Kimberly S.,"Redlands, CA",40,27,5,2.0,3/26/2015,"Usually Victoria gardens cheesecake factory is a very special place for me. And a place I only go every once in a great while it as it is a special treat. Yesterday when my boyfriend and I went the gravy that usually is served with the chicken and biscuits dinner was switched out for a brown gravy. I am horribly and highly allergic to any beef and or pork of any kind. I was not informed that this gravy had any kind of beef renderings, I have been very sick ever sense.  This was the only meal that I consumed yesterday. And I have been in pain, and I spent a sleepless night with horrible cramps and a lot of other details that I won't bother you with, as they are not pleasant. I will not visit this cheesecake factory again. The portions are huge and my boyfriend and I like to share. The meal was not separately plated. As it is at the cheesecake factory in Riverside at the Tyler Mall. The server at Tyler was kind enough to make our plates beautiful and inform the kitchen that we were sharing. This was not so at Victoria gardens. We were just handed a cold plate and told to five things up amongst ourselves. It wasn't very professional and I didn't feel that a good tip was in order. At the Victoria gardens Cheese Cake Factory we were treated like a number, rushed in and rushed out. Yet at the cheesecake factory at the Tyler Mall in Riverside we are always treated as though it is a special occasion. We are even sat by the window so that we can keep an eye on our vehicle as we have a small dog that we are very concerned about. She is older and needs lots of special attention.  The server at the cheesecake factory at Tyler also gave us a cup of ice water to go for our dog.  The server at Tylor just seemed to have a special knack. I will not be recommending the cheesecake factory at Victoria gardens and it may actually be a while before I visit any cheesecake factory again as this is been a very negative experience"
Samantha L.,"San Francisco, CA",676,953,2057,3.0,10/17/2009,"Victoria Gardens is a wonderful shopping center but this particular Cheesecake Factory gave less than satisfactory service last night. I guess I shouldn't be too surprised we had to wait over an hour for a table of 12. Thank goodness for the bar! Except we went to check on our table and the hostess told us:  ""Oh, we called you guys already."" ""Really?? The buzzer didn't go off"" ""Oh wait, i'm not sure."" ...........  I don't think she was supposed to tell us that. Anyways, they seated us 10 minutes later and we had to actually go up to the hostess table again to tell them our server was neglecting us and no one had come by our table. They were very apologetic but our party was ravenous last night and wanted bread! My heavy plate full of carbs was delicious though. I had a dish from their specials menu: the Chicken Bellagio. Breaded Chicken over a plate of noodles with a cream sauce and an arugula salad. It's comfort food, it's buttery, and it leaves you feeling a teeny bit guilty. To top it off I had their Red Velvet Cheesecake! It's layered with red velvet cake and vanilla cheesecake with a gigantic dallop of whipped cream. It's very rich, just like all their other selections of cheesecake. Red velvet cake almost seems trendy as of late.."
Courage J.,"Azusa, CA",0,9,9,2.0,10/17/2014,I love the food don't get me wrong but my father is disabled and unable to use his right arm so it's hard for him to eat certain thing a and they were not very happy with our requests to help make it easier for him to eat his food
Darly M.,"Bloomington, CA",108,22,5,2.0,1/10/2015,"Went to TCF with my bf tonite and I was very disappointed. The wait for a table wasn't long at all, and being that it was a Friday night 15 min wait was great! We order about 10 mins after we were seated. I wanted steak and noticed that almost all of the steaks on the menu only came with fries :/. I decided to go with the steak Diane since it came with mashed potatoes and mushrooms. It took 45 mins for our food to arrive after we ordered. I repeat 45 mins. Which I wouldn't have been so upset about had my food been good. DO NOT ORDER THE STEAK DIANE DISH. while it seems appealing in menu description, the actual dish is anything but. The steak tasted VERY low quality, not even top sirloin meat. I don't know what kind of meat it was but it was horrible. I was soo hungry that I ate half, I had to I was just to Hungry. I can't believe I wasted my time, if I do ever come back which would be highly unlikely I think I'll just stick to wine and cheesecake. Very dissatisfied experience :(."
Benoit C.,"Alta Loma, CA",14,11,,2.0,10/14/2014,"I really LOVE cheese cake its one of my fav deserts , But that being said I come here all the time I like the food and the feeling of the place. Cheesecake is supposed to be a velvet melt in your mouth type of food and the last time I have the NY Cheesecake it was very dry for a cheesecake. And the server was rude, The wait for a table was 45 plus min and not at anytime was there a happy person waiting, I would recomend if they are that busy get more seats to have people sit and wait in! and at least offer drinks! I will think twice about going to this place again might drive to the riverside one."
Joann P.,"Fontana, CA",25,16,14,3.0,6/21/2014,"We just came home from there, we were seated immediately which was great... our waitress was very rude,  we felt like we were being rushed... I will still go back and hope not to get the same waitress"
Cindy S.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,17,,2.0,11/17/2011,"Once upon a time this place was my FAV since they have SO many Lunch and Dinner options for me and is within walking distance to us. The food is super delicious comfort food.  However, the last 2-3 times the service was BLAH! All of which were girls who acted as if they didn't want to be there (mind you it's slow). I feel a tip is something earned and NOT expected. I've had to wait a ridiculous amount of time for a drink refill (2 different times) and not once did they come back and check to see how our food was until they brought the check."
Madeline D.,"Redlands, CA",3,33,41,4.0,3/6/2012,I come here every so often and I have yet to have a bad experience. The staff is friendly and the food is pretty good. They found my weakness for fried macaroni and cheese balls.  Their cheesecakes are delicious and it takes me a little too long to decide on which one to order. The Kahlua Cocoa Coffee Cheesecake is probably my favorite and is definitely a must try.. as of all of their cheesecakes. So glad it's part of Victoria Gardens; you can fill up on cheesecake and burn off the calories as you walk around and shop.  The ONLY problem I have with this particular restaurant is that it's always busy and there's always at least a 30 minute wait (unless you go in the daytime during the middle of the week). But I can't knock a restaurant for being good enough that they get busy.
Karimeh T.,"San Francisco, CA",17,14,9,4.0,6/15/2014,Had the shrimp and angel hair pasta. My husband enjoyed the wasabi crusted ahi! He said it was delicious. My kids had the pizzas. They both enjoyed them. It was yummy and not that crowded as I thought would be on Father's Day.
Joe B.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",180,67,23,5.0,9/27/2011,"Okay so here's what you need to do: 1. Order Chicken Nachos 2. Sub French Fries for Tortilla Chips 3. Sub Bacon for Chicken 4. Get ready to have an orgasm in your mouth.  This discovery was the best food discovery ever. You end up with crisp french fries, covered in delicious cheeses topped with amazing tasting bacon. So much flavor!  The restaurant itself is like every other big chain restaurant you eat at but this place has great desserts too."
Amy U.,"Redlands, CA",4,48,30,3.0,5/16/2014,"It's the same as any other CF, always consistent.  A little loud at night, but typical."
