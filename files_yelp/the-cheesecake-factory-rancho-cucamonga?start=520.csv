Arturo B.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",108,20,,5.0,11/6/2013,Best restaurant in town! They have a wide variety. They are always willing to substitute healthier options and give us extra sauces. I like to order for curve side pick up. I go there so much that they recognize my voice when I call and know how I want my food
Melissa H.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",23,4,3,5.0,9/22/2014,I come here at least once a week. The wait staff are helpful and friendly. The bread is almost always warm and quickly brought. Happy hour is awesome. The factory chop salad is amazing and my favorite item on the menu. The Chocolate tuxedo creme cheesecake is light and a perfect way to end your night.
Jim G.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",14,89,41,3.0,7/4/2014,"I'm giving 3 stars because of a lack of service. I've been coming here since they opened and I always like the food and the cheesecake is awesome. I only sit at the bar now when I want to eat here, they treat you good and don't ignore you. Good luck with the service if you sit anywhere else in this place, I always felt like the server thought they're  doing me a favor by waiting on me."
Jadira R.,"Las Vegas, NV",327,425,2079,4.0,5/22/2010,"MMM, this place is soo yummy! I took my mom here for Mother's Day and we both loved it so much!  We ordered BBQ Salmon, some pasta (id remember the name), green tea, tropical tea, and blueberry cheesecake.  We started with the complimentary bread which we loved and finished completely. Then we got our refreshing drinks followed by the entrees.  The pasta and salmon was soo freakin' delicious! I'm glad the portions were big because we got to take some home! The cheesecake came out. I've never had blueberry cheesecake before, but I wouldn't mind having it again after this! It was so tasty and perfectly sweetened. I loved it! I'm giving them a 4 instead of a 5 because the food was BOMB, but the service kinda lacked. The waitress never went to our table to see how we were doing. The only times we saw her were when she gave us our drinks and took our orders. I plan on coming back, numerous times!"
Liza A.,"Fontana, CA",0,6,,4.0,10/18/2015,"I have always been a big fan of The Cheesecake Factory, but I must say last night was disappointing. My husband ordered a Cobb Salad, never have we seen a Cobb salad look so sad and unappetizing. It was all mixed together and drenched with dressing. Now I like allot of dressing, but this was ridicules. The waitress was very kind and apologetic and offered to return it, but we hate to see food thrown away and are never share what they will be bringing back the next time (with all the scary stories you here). The cheesecake we ordered to go was also disappointing, for the amount of money you pay for desert, you would think you would get a nice slice, I believe they are cutting the slices smaller, what's up with that. On a positive note, I ordered the Louisiana Chicken Pasta, we both enjoyed it very much."
Tiffany G.,"Buckeye, AZ",8,14,,2.0,1/25/2012,"This review is directly related to the service received at Cheesecake Factory. All of the food we ate was excellent. My mom wanted to go to the Cheesecake Factory for her birthday so we made the trip down there. The wait time was 45 minutes for a Saturday evening around 6pm. Not bad at all. We were seated 60 minutes later, still not too bad for a Saturday evening with football on. Our waiter came, took our drink order, came back with the drinks, and then took our dinner order. My dad ordered the garlic pasta, my mom ordered the chicken tacos off the light menu, my husband ordered the mac n cheese burger, and I ordered the shrimp tacos off the light menu. Twenty or so minutes later, my dad's food came out. Kidding you not, five minutes went by before my mom's food came out. Another three to four minutes later my husband's food came out. I asked the server where my food was and she said the manager would be over to explain, then she bolted.  When the manager came over, instead of addressing the table, she spoke only to me. Of course there was some mix-up in the kitchen on where my food was. But she never explained why the rest of the food came out at different times and while she kept apologizing, it was clear she did not care. Once the food finally made it, it was good. I'm disappointed in the lack of service but will try another Cheesecake Factory down the road. Just not this one."
R. L.,"Lansing, MI",2,174,4,1.0,5/5/2014,"Never again! The hostess told us there was a 20 minute wait for dinner, and then we had to wait an hour and a half! Not to mention the hostess was incredibly rude and careless. Early on we found out she didn't have our party down for the buzzer she gave us. We only were finally seated when we approcahed a different hostess about the issue. So disappointing and ruined our dining experince. Their food does not taste as good when you are so put-off."
Carina L.,"Fontana, CA",3,7,,5.0,6/23/2014,"Loved the service. Lots of people but we didn't wait long. The food was great, so were the drinks and the cheese cake (of course)."
Phil L.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",3,34,4,3.0,11/28/2013,"Just discovered that I haven't rated this place, so I went there today to reevaluate..  I generally like this place but actually find it too hit and miss regarding food quality and service.  Today I ordered the pasta carbonara and substituted the garlic cream sauce for the meat sauce, the waitress then came back and told me it would be $3 more and that was fine. I then received a spaghetti with meat sauce instead of the carbonara plate I ordered...  The waitress took it back and then came back and stated they tossed peas and bruschetta into the spaghetti plate she had taken away. What??  Lol. I told her to take it back and remake the right dish that I ordered..  Haha. But...  Then the manager came and talked to us and ensured my dish is being freshly prepared and took it off the bill.  Don't forget to always let the waitress know when something's not right with your order/meal or the service, you deserve a good dining experience and a quality meal.  In my case, the waitress already knew that this was wrong and alerted the manager before I could say anything..  That's a good thing, but at the end, the waitress ended up to not be attentive and was MIA for the most part..   Probably because she had too many other tables to wait on. That's one of the Cheesecake Factory's problems, they're just too big!!  Management can't handle the volume on a consistent basis..  I won't be back for dinner until that day when I'm absolutely craving mediocre food with bad service..  Lol. However, their cheesecake is yummy!!  YBW!  Journey On Yelpers!!  Talk to you soon!!   PMAN."
ConsciousCustomer B.,"Compton, CA",4,7,,1.0,2/5/2013,"This location is NO BUENO They don't make the cheesecake here its FROZEN. slow service. cheap with the portions . stingy with the bread. not enough vegetarian/vegan options veggie burger is so gross mushy bland yuck! to pricey for food that is not fresh.we complained and the waitress said that's how its made and the mgr wasn't there that day.

Dayna C.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",2,30,,4.0,5/14/2014,"Who doesn't like this place!! I love the skinnylicious menu... The flatbread pizzas are my favorite. I always enjoy going here and of course, vanilla bean cheesecake!"
Xyruz D.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",94,14,9,4.0,5/4/2014,"Cheesecake Factory. Everybody knows the place already so what can i say haha. They have Sunday brunch. A variety of pastas, burgers, specialties, and low calorie menu. Oh and of course cheesecakes! 4 stars cause of the wait time. Severs are nice and friendly and the atmosphere is always nice here."
Chelsey W.,"Fontana, CA",3,76,4,5.0,4/8/2014,"If you go for a weekend dinner, expect to wait for a WHILE to be seated. For any group of people. But once you're seated, its great and worth the wait. Food, service, quality of meal, thumbs up wayy way high! Prices are reasonable."
Melissa H.,"Chino, CA",623,358,220,4.0,12/5/2011,"This is a great group venue because they always have something for every taste.  Their menu is extensive and long.  It took me forever to select a dish (too many choices) but I selected from their Skinnylicious Menu - Factory Chopped Salad.  It was delicious. Yet I was with a group and each dish ordered by my friends I wish I had ordered.  The Spicy Chicken and Southwest Chicken looked amazing.  And let's not forget their warm sour dough and squaw rolls served with butter brought to the table before you place your order.  Scrumdiliumpous! Who can visit Cheesecake Factory and not order desert, that like a crime.  So I ordered the new flavor called Hershey Chocolate Cheesecake.  Wow!  If you are a chocolate lover like me it, the desert would have been the highlight of the evening.  Yummy, but it was so rich that I could only eat a couple of bites. Tip:  I you plan to visit this location, be prepared to wait 30 minutes to be seated at dinner time, it is a very busy restaurant.  Plus, we had to use the flashlight on my smart phone because the table lighting is very poor which makes it difficult to read the menu.  And if you are on a diet, be sure to ask for the calorie booklet, you will be surprised if you are ordering off the regular menu.  My slice of cheesecake alone was over 1400 calories.  Yikes."
Calen H.,"Fontana, CA",57,8,,3.0,4/18/2014,Food was good and the young man who brought us our food was really nice and did a better job than our waitress. We sat there for about 20 minutes and were not checked on once. Then sat there another 10 minutes for the waitress to pick up our check. To top it off she was so rude and just seemed like she didn't care about giving us good service. What a waste of time and money.
Gerry W.,"Victorville, CA",12,16,7,4.0,3/23/2014,The wife's favorite.  Best chicken ceaser salad yet. So for that 4 stars. It's pricey and usually crowded so you ll wait for a table . The steak dishes are good too. Good not great but if in the mood for a chicken ceaser it doesn't get better
Mandy C.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",11,65,9,4.0,4/15/2014,"So I took my son here yesterday and we ordered the smores cheesecake to share and it was sooo good I had to come tell you fellow yelpers about it...so if your ever undecided about what kind of cheesecake to order, you cant go wrong with this piece. Its sweet, chocolate, marshmelow, crunchy graham craker with the perfect salty taste to balance it out is sheer indulgence! A must try more than once!"
Jay B.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",63,50,1,4.0,7/5/2012,"The food is pretty good across the board. The Hershey cheesecake is delicious. Here is my rating factor, on a scale of 1-10 (10 being the best) Food - 9 Atmosphere - 9 Selection - 10 Service - 5 Cleanliness - 8 Overall - 8.2"
Moe Y.,"Victorville, CA",2,17,6,1.0,4/8/2015,"Very nice facility, nasty food. The only thing that tasted normal is the water.. We ordered nachos and it was basically chips topped with chees and overlooked in the microwave the chips were chewy and the chees was burned I should of stopped this disaster from that point, and I wish I did the koby burger below average and the fries were cold. The burrito was 90% rice and 10% meat with no seasoning a total disrespect to Mexican food  Than their is a pasta with shrimp 20 bucks for 5 pices of small shrimp. Than the had the balls to ask if we like desert that should of been it this place makes great chees cakes many customers were buying it to go and eating it outside the restaurant I think they new better. What a 150 dollar joke with only iced water and no desert for five people.."
Teresa L.,"Ontario, CA",25,45,90,5.0,1/31/2014,"Trevor was an excellent waiter.  He made sure our meal was made to our satisfaction.  In addition, he had a friendly disposition.  Thank you Trevor for making my first visit to Cheesecake factory pleasant.  :)"
