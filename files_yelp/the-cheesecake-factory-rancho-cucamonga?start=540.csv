Jenny g.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",4,43,20,4.0,3/9/2014,Aside from being packed on peak hours its a great ace to enjoy mimosa's and brunch! Food is always good and the cheesecake is out of this world! The banana cream with extra caramel poured over the top- holy moly delicious!!!!!!!
Beverly T.,"Chino Hills, CA",191,560,7,3.0,2/11/2012,"Who has ever had anything disgustingly bad here? I mean... really.... I normally opt for miso salmon or that pasta farfalle with BACON and peas but this time around I wasn't in the mood for anything fishy or heavy. Renee's special looked good. It comes with half sandwich of your choice, generous bowl of soup of day, and a salad. My choice of sandwich was the almond chicken salad. I personally thing Costco's chicken salad is probably better but this one wasn't too bad tasting. Even though they say it's half of a sandwich, it's really like a whole sandwich. The bread comes slathered in butter and toasted.  I got to try their New England clam chowder, which was pretty tasty. The balsamic dressing is always delicious to me. Altogether, I personally wouldn't get tha chicken salad again, but would get anything with that balsalmic dressing. Service was okay. They crammed 7 of us ladies in a booth. They were slow in getting one of us a cheesecake and they never refilled my diet coke."
Allison M.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",150,118,47,5.0,2/9/2014,"Absolutely love the Cheesecake Factory! Never disappointed when I leave here. We got here on a Saturday night and had about an hour wait. So we sat at the bar and enjoyed a couple blue moons on tap. Great service at the bar, and you also have the option of ordering anything from the menu there. We could have ordered our dinner if we wanted. Then once we got seated we were served delicious, warm, fresh baked bread. We got cheese triangles as an appetizer. My baby daddy got fish tacos. He personally wasn't impressed with them and said he will be ordering something different next time. Said the fish wasn't very crunchy. I on the other hand LOVED my meal. I get the fettuccini with sun dried tomatoes and chicken. It is delicious and one of the only thing I get here! The chicken is grilled and covered in a white sauce with sun dried tomatoes chopped up. To die for! Service was excellent also!"
Bk K.,"Los Angeles, CA",97,41,22,4.0,2/8/2014,On weekend dinner hours the parking is hard and the lines are always long....for some reason the napkins and utensils appear half cleaned when it does get busy. But otherwise its the same old cheesecake factory with somewhat decent to good service.
Michelle D.,"Verdemont, CA",103,75,42,4.0,4/17/2013,"Appropriately named, The Cheesecake Factory has impressive Cheesecake. I have yet to indulge in a flavor I didn't love. My most recent purchase included the Red Velvet Cheesecake and the Mango Key Lime Cheesecake. The Red Velvet Cheesecake had 2 thick layers of moist Red Velvet Cake nestled between 2 equally thick layers of creamy Cheesecake and topped with white chocolate shavings. Needless to say.... it's pure heaven! The Mango Key Lime Cheesecake was also outstanding. Made up of Key Lime Cheesecake situated on a thick coconut crust and topped with a light mango sauce it too was out of this world!"
Laura M.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",1,49,12,5.0,5/22/2015,My fav restaurant love the shrimp scampi here and the calamari as the App great service even when they are busy they try to be helpful and fast . I come here weekly most def part of my top 3 places to eat
Lesley C.,"Winnetka, CA",0,12,,1.0,10/18/2014,"If I could leave negative stars, I would. This place was a joke--lost our name, then tried to make us wait ANOTHER half hour (which we wound up doing); then tried to put us in the sun on a hot day; screwed up our orders; there were chunks of chicken gristle in the cole slaw; my medium-rare burger looked like a hockey puck.  Made us wait an additional half-hour for the ""fast"" appetizer.  What a joke--NEVER AGAIN."
Trissia W.,"Westminster, CA",130,421,14,5.0,4/7/2011,"this is a dessert only review. Stopped by with Emily on a nice paid vacation day off so that could have some bearing on my 5 stars. Ordered a non-cheesecake dessert which might hav ebeen called Tower of truffle fudge cake. The slice I got was $8 but large enough for 2 to gorge on and even for 4 to share as a pretty nice dessert. I honestly have not been into chocolate or desserts for the past few years but this thing was amazing. Maybe because i don't eat so many sweets I was able to appreciate the cocoa, fudge lovelyness of the whole thing. Layers of chocolate mousse, layers of rich chocolate cake and the topping/outer layer is a thick fudge. Then they pipe a bunch of not too sweet fresh whipped cream along the side of it. I do LOVE their whipped cream. I was able to eat this dessert over my 4 day birthday celebration weekend and will recommend this to any ladies struggling with PMS chocolate cravings."
Shawn K.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,4,,3.0,4/6/2014,"3 stars is where this place stands, only because of their cheese cakes and ambience.   The food was sub par. Our.server was ok,  but nothing special.  This place has a stench of old beer.  I will come back, But just for drinks and desserts.  Theirs only a few cheesecake factory that is run right. And this is not one of them."
Carol R.,"Hesperia, CA",0,12,,4.0,4/3/2016,"Today was my third visit to this restaurant.  I have never been disappointed.  Yes, crowded, yes parking at Victoria is always a b*tch.  However they provide you with a pager and you can stroll, or visit with your group while waiting.  I am especially grateful to the staff today:   Our son, age 16,  has a severe allergy to eggs.  He can be horizontal for the rest of the day if his food touches something with egg.  If he is ""ambushed"" he can go into anaphylaxis.   Today was his first visit to the Cheesecake Factory.    They were especially accommodating to his needs.  The manager came to the table, as busy as the restaurant was, got down to eye level (we were sitting) and explained that the pizza crust was prepared in a plant which processes eggs.  Also got back to us regarding the ice cream used for the milk shake.  Very attentive in comparison to most ""lower end"" (perhaps) restaurants in which the staff gives you a blank stare or tries unsuccessfully to hide their disdain for you in inconveniencing them!    Everyone in our party of seven was pleased with their order, including my brother visiting from New Hampshire.    Go eat there.  I suggest on a day when you can linger and visit.  You won't be disappointed."
Ryan R.,"Salem, OR",174,57,75,5.0,5/25/2013,Came here for our four year wedding anniversary. Our servers name was Kelly and she treated us very well and was exceptionally friendly. We are considering moving to this area and Kelly did a great job making us feel welcome in Rancho.
Nc A.,"Long Beach, CA",2,27,1,5.0,6/22/2014,"We went here for dessert while we were out on the town. Great service, great atmosphere, lovely setting. Sat outside and really enjoyed it. Cheesecake (Turtle and Godiva) was sublime!"
Maribel D.,"Ojai, CA",36,66,7,3.0,4/2/2014,"Jessica our server wasn't the best, she didn't give or ask if  we wanted bread and took long to get to our table so we can get our order in , all the other times I have been here service is usually good but I honestly don't come here to eat a lot . Overall service was not good towards the end she was nice of course so she can get a good tip , but uh no that didn't help."
Paul C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,9,,4.0,3/31/2015,This was probably one of best cheese cake factory experience i had. We went on busy Sunday afternoon. Was able to be seated quickly and have a great waitress. Definitely will come back!
Martin M.,"San Bernardino, CA",0,3,,4.0,6/15/2015,"Good food, good service. Have yet to be disappointed  while going to the cheesecake factory. Perfect date night."
Raquel P.,"Covina, CA",64,53,17,4.0,2/20/2012,"This Cheesecake factory is located in victoria gardens. I rarely go to restaurants like this because of the large portions. The service is good and the food is good too. I ordered the fettucini with chicken and sun dried tomatoes and it was really good.  I like this restaurant because they have a wide range of different foods like asian, mexican, italian, and american.We didn't have to wait so long for our table. We were seated right away if I remember right. tip: come hungry and leave room for their cheesecake."
The Chris M.,"Los Angeles, CA",130,86,155,4.0,11/4/2011,"I'm rating it a 3.5 rounding to 4 I've been here a number of times and decided to finally write a review. When you get here you'll most likely immediately notice, after the casino-like exterior and dim interior, the huge crowd. Today I went with two others on a cold night. We were given a wait time of up to 35 minutes for a table inside or outside. In 10 minutes, we were given a table outside. My tip, if you hate waiting but can brave the elements (hot or cold), try opting for an outside table. I was reluctant at first, but it wasn't that bad outside considering they have a couple of outdoor heaters.  The menu is vast and international. Food here is a notch above other chains in quality but with that so are the prices. Average price for entrees are $10-$16. I suggest eating at lunch for better prices.  I ordered the White Chicken Chili ($11.95), one ordered the BBQ Burger ($11.50), while the other ordered the Shrimp Angel Hair ($16.95).  Everyone enjoyed their food and portions were not stingy but not overly abundant. Only weird thing was my dish came with white rice so I had a laugh when I saw the miniscule portion they gave me! I believe it was scooped with a tablespoon. With that said the chili it accompanied was enough. It was a bit spicy which I love but if you can't tolerate spice easily, I'd reconsider or ask if they can alter it.  We finished off with the restaurant's namesake! A slice of strawberry cheesecake! This they do well! The slice was good enough for three to share. Slices cost $6.95-$7.95 depending on what kind you get. No experience here is complete without trying at least a bite of cheesecake! Service here is always prompt and attentive even on busy days. I've tried other items on the menu and the food has been good and consistent in quality but for me personally, it's nothing that'll blow your socks off. The cheesecake never disappoints though!"
Kevin L.,"San Luis Obispo, CA",349,617,215,4.0,1/19/2013,"I have never not loved the Cheesecake Factory. I've always had good service and the food is great (not to mention the crazy huge list of cheesecakes). Came in with a friend and we waited less than five minutes for a seat. We ordered our drinks as soon as we sat down and got them quickly. Because we hadn't seen each other in a while, we spent more time catching up that actually looking at the menu. The server came over a ton of times, each time he was nice even though we still had no clue what we were ordering. We decided on an appetizer (spinach artichoke dip) since we were taking forever to order. Eventually we decided to order and got the appetizer. The dip was really good! The food came out maybe ten or fifteen minutes after we'd ordered it and it was really good as well. I got a salad that was huge and delicious. We had to order cheesecake, just had to. She got the regular with strawberries and I got the pineapple upside down cheesecake. The cheesecake was really good. It wasn't as rice as the regular cheesecakes because they layer cheesecake between pieces of upside down cake. the pineapple was plentiful and the cheesecake was great! I can't make a habit out of coming here because it's not super cheap and the food constantly makes the ""worst food"" (calories) list but I will definitely be back!!!"
Nicole A.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",22,4,,2.0,3/15/2015,"The service: We wanted to order some food for take-home, so we utilized the curbside service. After looking through the menu, we selected our entrees and I called in the order. I began telling the greeter on the phone that I would like to place an order to go. Before I finished my sentence, she put me on hold without saying a word to me, which I found to be odd. The only reason I knew I was on hold was because the hold music started playing. After placing my order with the bakery, I was told it would be ready in about 15-20 minutes. We arrived at the curbside parking about 20 minutes after I placed my order, and called the restaurant to let them know we were there. They said they would bring the food right out to us, but 20 minutes later, we were still waiting. We ended up going inside to get the food, which had just been sitting on their counter. Our extremely long wait out at curbside was never even mentioned by them. No apologies, nothing. Being too exhausted from the day, we just paid for the food and left. Needless to say, by the time we got home, our food was cold. The food: I ordered the Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta. When I opened the carton, I originally didn't see any chicken.  It wasn't until after I started stirring the pasta a little that I found the 5 bite-sized pieces of chicken that were included in this $18 plate of cold food. The chicken was dry to the point of being hard to chew and swallow. The pasta itself was pretty bland. My husband ordered the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp. He said his was ok, but probably would have been better if it was warm. Overall, we may give this place one more try, but I highly doubt we will use Curbside To Go again."
Katherina V.,"Seattle, WA",328,33,76,3.0,12/20/2011,"-Must try stuffed mushrooms! (About 6 mushrooms per place) -Just like any other Cheesecake Factory, probably not as big as the other location, but still the same ambiance nonetheless. -Conveniently located to eat at after a day of shopping."
