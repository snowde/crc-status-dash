Sharna B.,"Victorville, CA",0,50,74,1.0,7/20/2014,I was at this location on 7/19/2014. We arrived at approximately 4.00 pm. We went in got our pager and waited. After about 30 minutes our pager went off and we were seated by our waiter. So we're at our table relaxing and talking ejoying ourselves when some male Cheesecake Factory employee confronted us asking us with a very angry look on his face and in a very demining tone of voice and asked us  if we had checked in.I mean this male employee was behaving like he was coming down off METH and he needed a fix. So we did'nt respond.  We were just  looking at him like what in the hell are you talking about and what is your problem. So he raised his head up with his nosie  flaring open he was turning red and foaming at the mouth loudly repeated to us did you check in. I remained very calm because i have class and morals so i simply pointed towards our waiter and told this animal to talk to him. The problem was our waiter forget to punch in our ticket after or before he seated us so this low class amoral no manners havin unprofessional disrespectful gasbag thought we actually snuck in and seated ourselves what a flippin empty suit . He had to be on some kind of drugs. Our waiter was very professional and he apolagized for this animals behavior. I felt this male employee owed us an apology so when i saw him again i said excuse me i did'nt like the way you talked us you were rude and you are the one who made the mistake not us. He looked at us with a very nasty look on his face and said im doing my job and walked away. I called him a DICK HEAD. Personally i wanted to reinact a sense from one of those reality shows. This fool has ZERO class and no morals he woulld'nt even apologize and he is the one who made the mistake. Finally a manager came over and talked to us she was very nice she apologized and compted us our drinks and a slice of cheesecake. So i need to thank the jackass whoever he was for our free drinks  and slice of cheesecake. He needs to be retrained in customer service and suspended for one week without pay.
Vince W.,"Yucca Valley, CA",39,2,2,1.0,7/17/2011,Horrible service for a party of 20. It took 2hrs to seat everyone with a reservation. Wait staff was unable to keep the orders straight. Trying to breakup the bill was a nightmare. Management tried the intimidation tactic when their own staff couldnt figure out what was ordered
Marielena C.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,2,1,1.0,5/23/2015,"This place sucks for customer service it was my sister in laws birthday and we decided to eat here we had a party of 14 we were told that we will be waiting for 2 hours arriving at 6:40 and the time is 9:10 and we haven't been seated the manager ""gabriel"" did not even help us he said that we havnt reached our 2 hours really do the math but we did get good service by the server the main reason why I was mad was when I asked about the seating the people in the front had attitudes I am the customer be polite I am bringing business so you guys get a pay check be more helpful and respectful please I am here with family and it doesn't feel nice when I get treated this way in front of them its embarressing and rude I hope this helps if you decide to go with big groups"
Judy P.,"Pasadena, CA",37,8,2,2.0,1/31/2014,I'm sad give this restaurant two stars! The menu has great variety but the service here is always bad! Always rushed and not attentive. Did not experience a very welcoming visit. I will reconsider driving to a different location next time.
Tony R.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",31,107,2,3.0,3/15/2011,"Went here for lunch yesterday and once again I was not terribly impressed by the Cheesecake Factory. I know many people are fans of this chain, but I simply do not understand what all the hoopla is about. The food was mediocre (aside from the tasty bread) and the calorie intake from one of these meals is massive!  They now give out a nutritional guide with the menus. I looked up the calorie content of some of the salads I was looking at and the Santa Fe and Cobb salads were 1600 & 1700 calories respectively. The majority of what I saw on here was mind-boggling. I can't say I have seen too many resturants with the new calorie menus but I have seen fast food menus with lower calorie counts than this place."
Shannon M.,"Riverside, CA",142,138,108,2.0,7/21/2013,"Was seated to find dirty silverware (restaurant 101 - always have clean dishes, silverware and glasses for your customers), the server was not friendly at all and seemed preoccupied.  Thankfully, she was only covering the break of our actual server Mary Ellen who was VERY nice and VERY attentive.  We ordered the Cajun Chicken ""Littles"" and Renee's Lunch Special. The Chicken Littles' breading looked very dry and unappealing.  They did not have much flavor but the chicken itself was actually moist.  The mashed potatoes were dry/crumbly and cold.  With the Renee's Special, a bay leaf was left in the potato soup which we did not find right away and it left an awful after-taste in the soup.  The sourdough bread that the sandwich was served on could have broken a tooth.  That was really inappropriate bread for a sandwich.  For dessert we had the wild blueberry cheesecase and the chocolate coconut cream cheesecake and both were delicious.  We only ate here because I had received a giftcard.  I do not care for the atmosphere at this restaurant and I rarely have encountered employees who are friendly or even bother to smile. There is some weird arrogance in the air.  Mary Ellen, our server was the surprise exception but I doubt I will go back here anytime soon.  I think it is VERY overrated."
Donald S.,"Glendora, CA",141,357,339,5.0,11/18/2011,"Great Food, Great Atmosphere, Great Service, Outstanding Burgers, Low Prices.... and the Bass Pro Shop is within walking distance!"
Josie G.,"West Covina, CA",0,4,,1.0,10/28/2014,"Staff are rude including manager. We went for dinner Oct.17, around 5:15PM for 6:30 party of 15 and no one is waiting a lot of empty table but manager said we need to wait for 2 hrs if we want an inside sitting. Patio he can sit us at 6:30. We have no choice but to wait because it is too late to call everybody and go to a diff. restaurant, but smart move while we are on a waiting list with this restaurant my husband went to the next one to put our name on the waiting list. Karma came and at around 6PM there was a power outage and it was only that restaurant. They lost a lot of money because they close that night. Hope they will learn their lesson and be nice."
Sean S.,"Victorville, CA",39,28,13,5.0,5/14/2014,I love it here the food is great here the drink are good people are nice it is by the mall so after shopping you enjoy a nice dinner with family an friend good place to go on a date an chill with your friend every thing is good here you should come an hang out here you would love it.
Rae B.,"Apple Valley, CA",1,12,,2.0,5/14/2015,"The food is pretty good here I love the skinnylicious menu they have the entire menu of lower-calorie entrees which i think is awesome. My complaint is the service. This restaurant is located inside  Victoria Gardens most people get out of their car and just walk the entire strip, therefore having shopping bags and strollers with them. . my mom and I went in and we had a stroller with us and the ladies at the front counter were incredibly rude because we wanted to eat inside, out of the cold and wind,  with the stroller. My 1 year old daughter was asleep in the stroller so when they asked if I would leave the stroller up at the front which was also holding hundreds of dollars in merchandise I said I'd rather not. , the lady at the front counter with the long black hair rolled her eyes and sighed and said just put them at table 30. We were very embarrassed as we walked shamefully to our table and apologize to the waiter for the stroller. Soon after my baby woke up and needed a high chair my mom brought the stroller back and asked the lady, ok the babies up can we leave the stroller here and the lady said very rudely ""yep that's where we put them"" . I    don't know if I'll be back,  the waiter was friendly but All 3 females we spoke to were awful."
Mrs. H.,"Irvine, CA",2,101,3,1.0,1/27/2011,"I love the Cheesecake Factory.... but this location has issues! I gave it a few tries, but service was repeatedly horrible, slow, and borderline rude.  Once, the waitress spilled iced tea over my WHITE pants and did not bother to apologize! Neither did the manager...!  Needless to say, that was the last time I dined in. I still do take out because I love their food. Service at the bakery is much better."
Veronica C.,"Escondido, CA",133,151,45,5.0,3/6/2013,"Near my college & always here for their miso salmon! Only place I save room for dessert, chocolate coconut cheesecake,yum!"
Jennifer S.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,34,16,1.0,12/28/2012,"I love The Cheesecake Factory, however this location is awful! I have gone here a few times and each time the service is either awful or the food is not up to standard as other locations.  When you complain to the manager, he defends his rude, stuck up, and entitled servers rather than listening to the customers concerns. An example of one time a went  I just ordered cheesecake and when I asked for no whip cream they forgot and when I reminded them they took back the cheesecake took off the whip cream and pretty much threw the container to me with major attitude."
mike p.,"Duarte, CA",0,18,1,2.0,12/31/2012,"This review is reflective only of my most recent experience at this particular Cheesecake Factory.  I have had pretty good service and experiences in the past, but Saturday night was definitely not one of them. I went with a friend to eat dinner around 5:30 PM, or so.  After checking in I was informed it'd be about an hour wait, which didn't bother me because I had expected it after seeing the crowd.  We were seated about 20 minutes faster than expected, which was about the best part of the meal.  We ordered the crab/artichoke dip for an appetizer, and my friend got a glass of wine and I had a Mojito.  My friend's entree was the endive salad and I had shrimp with angel hair pasta.  The food tasted fine, and the server was ok.  My friend's salad, however, was basically void of endive.  I have no idea what that stuff is, but according to her, there was none in the salad.  There was a shift change before our meal was over and we ended up with a new server.  When we were finished, I requested a box for leftovers which took a little longer than usual to receive.  And I'm not sure if i'm wrong or not, but I remember the servers at CF boxing up the food for you.  I'm fully capable of boxing my own food mind you, but that's one of those extra mile things.  I also wanted to get a box for the bread, but the server seemed too preoccupied with the party next to us to notice I was trying to get her attention.  After about 10 minutes, I ended up asking another server for the box. The primary issue with my meal happened about 11 hours or so after it ended.  That's right, food poisoning.  I woke up Sunday morning at 6 AM with an immediate urge to go to the bathroom.  What followed was a day filled with trips to the bathroom, spaced an average of 15-20 minutes apart.  And when I wasn't in the bathroom, I was laying in bed, writhing in pain.  Put simply, I felt as if someone was wringing my insides the same way you would wring water out of a wet towel.  It is now 12:30 AM, Monday morning as I right this and I am still suffering.  The bathroom trips have decreased in frequency and number, as have the sudden painful sensations, but they have not gone away entirely.  I have not been able to keep anything down all day, not even water.  My next step after this review is to contact the restaurant manager and inform him of my experience personally.  Hopefully the staff will be able to take some measures to ensure this won't happen again."
Angela C.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,2,,1.0,5/3/2015,We asked for clean glass of sprite to get another dirty glass not to mention dirty silverware with food particles on the each stting as well as on the saucers for our bread unfortunate we had to leave.  Very unsanitary!!!!!!
Christi D.,"Redlands, CA",31,108,85,4.0,9/9/2013,The cheesecake is a must! The chocolate chip cookie dough and red velvet and Oreo ones are amazing! So is the 30th anniversary! You can't go wrong with any of em! :)
Stephanie F.,"Fontana, CA",7,21,1,3.0,7/8/2013,"The food was OK. The only reason I'm giving them three stars is because the waiter was very nice and attentive to me and my party and because the desert ONLY. The place is nice but its always overcrowded (I think its because it's located in Victoria Gardens) some staff are kind of grumpy, we waited over an hour to get seated, after being seated waited like 30 min to order, after ordering, waited about 40 min to get food serve to us. If your really hungry and need to eat  in a short time, this place is not for you. However the deserts are really yummie!"
Michelle C.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",184,140,133,4.0,8/22/2011,"I ate here twice. I felt for the food i received it was overpriced. But, every friday I am here geting my fix on cheescake. I love the many selections and I wish I had a favorite but I dont. Less than $10.00 a slice is well worth it."
Matt C.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",143,57,86,2.0,4/15/2011,"I really don't get what the big deal is about The Cheesecake Factory. The food isn't that great and it's overpriced for what you get. This particular restaurant is always packed on the weekends, and that what I don't get. Granted their bar is very nice and well stocked, but I can think of a dozen other places I would rather drink at then there. While their main course food isn't that great, their desserts are pretty good, after all they are known for their cheesecake. The wait staff is fairly nice as well, they know it's busy and they try to be accommodating even under pressure. So bottom line, it's an ok place to have dessert and a drink, just be prepared to wait a while for a table."
Fouad M.,"San Diego, CA",13,228,3,4.0,10/10/2011,"I went to cheese cake factory with my friends and family. We had about 15  people in our group. This was a  Saturday night so we had to wait for a long time to get a table. Nevertheless, the staff was courteous. We were seated outside. After we were seated, the server got us drinks and took our orders. The appetizers were really delicious. The food was awesome and the atmosphere was great.  We would certainly go there again whenever we are in the mall."
