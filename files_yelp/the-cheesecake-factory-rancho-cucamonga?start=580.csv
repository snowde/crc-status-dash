Tara S.,"Fontana, CA",186,73,5,4.0,1/1/2014,"Usually, love this place, but tonight left a sour taste. They were way busy and seemed over whelmed. Orders were mixed up and we had to keep requesting things. They use to bring out little snack trays for the babies and toddlers. When we got them today, they simple cut up more bread for the kids. We already had that on the table. They should go back to giving out Cheerios and bananas. Waitress was very nice and helped us out as best as she could."
Chris I.,"Ontario, CA",0,50,6,4.0,4/25/2015,"The food was yummy, I was delighted to know I had vegan options. Went for my birthday on a Saturday evening. Waited about half an hour to be seated outside, as I requested. Had my first legal drink here.. it wasn't strong but it's ok. I enjoyed my experience at the Cheesecake Factory."
Jia Y.,"Cypress, CA",202,21,2,3.0,2/15/2012,It's almost always packed and the waiting area in the front is definitely not big enough so you'll be standing around very close to people as more people squeeze by. The staff are nice and the food was pretty good all around our table.  The waiter was also pretty good with stopping by to check on us and refill our drinks. I got the shrimp with angel hair pasta last time and it was good except for the fact that the shrimp were overcooked--but they were big at least.
Richard E.,"Redlands, CA",6,19,,4.0,9/18/2013,"The Cheesecake Factory is one of those restaurants where you can go into almost any one and have more or less the same experience, food- and service-wise. I don't mean that in a bad way, either. There's a nice sense of comfort in that consistency. So while nothing really needs to be said about this location in particular, I can say that (probably not unlike other locations) when you go there you're going to get good food at a nice price with friendly service. My girlfriend, sister, brother-in-law and I ate there for under $100, including desserts, appetizers and tips."
Liza E.,"Ontario, CA",0,38,,4.0,7/22/2012,"I am always happy and satisfied here! Be aware that you might have to wait on their busy nights (friday and saturday).  Place is huge, seating is ample and service tends to be great. I have tried quite a few dishes. My faves are the 4 cheese pasta and the bacon/avocado/turkey club. I have yet to try a bad dish. I have had a bad side dish, the sweet potato fries, but I don't like sweet potato. Our server gladly took them back and returned with regular fries.   Deserts are just as delicious. The best is the Godiva chocolate cheesecake. For the most part I don't like chocolate and cheesecake mixing, but this dessert is just heavenly. I love the basic cheesecakes to, those are just as wonderful. My only gripe (and its not that much of a gripe) is that the menu is very extensive.  It so hard to choose!"
Angela M.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",75,159,99,4.0,8/11/2013,"I love the Cheesecake Factory. My favorite dishes are the Chicken Costaletta and the Buffalo Blasts. The prices are what you would expect. The food is delicious, the ambiance is cool and intimate. The booths are huge, which is great! The reason I only gave 4 stars is because I am not a fan of their cheesecake, which...well...should be the selling point of The Cheesecake Factory, right? Other than that, I love it!"
Ann B.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",54,63,20,1.0,10/16/2013,What is the point of happy hour if they charge you regular price? And when we ordered the made to order guacamole why does it taste like it came out of a can?!! And the wait for the food when there's no one here? Really?!! This is the worse service ever.
L S.,"Yucaipa, CA",0,65,8,3.0,10/16/2013,I enjoyed the atmosphere and the food was well presented... But I was not at all impressed by the taste. Bleh. The cheese on the nachos was just nasty. Service was friendly.
The 1.,"Claremont, CA",78,414,268,4.0,11/5/2014,this is my favorite location. the reason for 4 stars and not 5 is because the service we got sucked really bad. we had a waitress named whitney and she was HORRIBLE and not very nice. the food was very good. i had the grilled shrimp with bacon sandwich and it was so so good! we ended with the godiva brownie for dessert. BOMB! will def be back!
Jade W.,"Las Vegas, NV",677,1185,1232,3.0,10/12/2010,"It's cheesecake factory- you kinda know what to expect.  I found that their iced green tea is good...it's kinda minty and a good refresher. The caramel chicken isn't bad, I like the ginger in the sauce and on their special menu they have a smaller portion of it. What my mom was eating was kinda meh- breaded chicken dish with a cream sauce of some sort. She kept eating my lunch instead so we kinda shared it.  Cheesecake is good, but I'm not a ""cheesecake person"" so I normally have to be in a mood to order. I took bites from my moms pina colada one and that was actually lovely that there wasn't a strong cheesecake presence, and more pineapple and coconut coming though.  Service was pretty friendly....nice considering last few times I've gone here I've had pretty ridiculous service.  I think I prefer it's ""sister"", Grand Luxe (mostly for beignets).  Average out all my experiences, it's an A-OK place."
Shaan J.,"Highland, CA",15,105,45,4.0,9/19/2013,Try their boca burger.  One of the BEST burgers I've ever had.
Johnny L.,"Riverside, CA",202,8,8,4.0,9/7/2011,Good food price is decent our waitress took forever to come back and take our orders it was only 3 people lol
Ryan D.,"Acton, CA",1,132,1,5.0,10/15/2013,"It's impossible to dislike the Cheesecake Factory. Great location, great service, great atmosphere, great food."
Ray N.,"Los Angeles, CA",218,14,,5.0,7/19/2013,"My girlfriend and I have eaten here a lot and the service is always great. Servers are courteous and the food is tasty. We usually share a Crusted Chicken Romano, Miso Salmon, and then save room for cheesecake. There is usually always a wait  for a table, especially on the weekend, but they provide a pager to notify you when your table is available. The portions are huge, so always keep that in mind. The environment is upscale and we love going to the Cheesecake Factory! Afterwards, we walk around Victoria Gardens and browse the shops and relax. Great way to enjoy any day in Southern California!"
Ato K.,"La Verne, CA",0,15,,1.0,10/13/2013,Waiters are not fair in seating. Just waited for over 45 mins for Booth whilst people who came after me were given booths. I just left without eating. Should have cussed them out.
OIivia H.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",347,318,11,4.0,6/8/2011,"There is no better surprise for a birthday boy or girl then showing up with an entire cheesecake from the Cheesecake Factory. A bit pricey but worth every amazing bite. Their Happy Hour is fab too, lots of small bites for cheap to share with friends.  Their regular menu is a bit generic and overpriced, stick to cheesecake runs and Happy Hour!"
Christina P.,"Chino Hills, CA",0,2,1,1.0,3/8/2015,Tissue have been to many Cheesecake Factory locations over the years and today's experience is by far the worst. I will be reporting them to the health department. My husband and I were seated at table 16 and we began to notice knats flying around the table. We had already placed our order at this point when my wine arrived there were 2 knats in the glass. I notified the waiter and he then told me he would bring another glass. I went to the hostess and requested that we be moved to another location. She told me we had a 10 to 15 wait before they could move us. Shortly after the appetizer arrived and the waiter said we would be served our main course  at another table. When my wine was delivered the waiter placed a napkin over the top of the glass to avoid knats from flying into the glass....seriously?.. the entree was delivered and we were never moved. The manager came to the table finally and told us that we should have said something earlier.....not to manager .....WE DID!!!! And you choose to do nothing. When I complained at the end all he said was sorry. I plan to file a complaint with the health department and I will never eat at Cheesecake Factory again!
Mario F.,"Glendale, CA",117,185,111,4.0,5/6/2013,"We love this place.  The wait is always long unfortunately.  Hopefully they can open some others in the area to cut down on their volume of people coming in.  Try the garlic noodles, they are awesome!! Thai lettuce wraps are our favorite appetizer!!"
Lachelle I.,"San Bernardino, CA",168,163,306,4.0,6/24/2013,Herb roasted chicken is AMAZING & I am not one to usually order chicken also the carrots are AMAZING & I don't usually like carrots lol ;) THAT'S how good it is! I would eat it everyday if I could with the delicious mashed potatoes & extra saucy goodness it's enough for two meals do worth the price easily! Service is slow only complaint
Larry H.,"Los Angeles, CA",119,352,32,4.0,4/4/2013,"This Cheesecake Factory is very clean and open.  Very inviting with patio seating as well.  The place is nice and clean andif you get thier early for lunch, you will get seated very swiftly.  Our server was very good and friendly.  We had the Lunch speacial of Fettuchene Alfedo with Chicken and we had them add bell peppers and onions to give it a bit more flavor.  It was very good!  Very large portion for a lunch special.  Most items on the menu can be shared.  The dinner salad with Ranch dressing was good and could be shared by two.  We ended it with a piece of Red Velvet Cheesecake.  Very good and again, enough for two people.  Very rich, but tasty.  The prices are still a bit high so I do not see why people bring the children as it is a waste of money on them.  However for a nice, lunch/dinner/desert, the Cheesecake Factory is a nice place to check out.  Be forwarned, if you go at peak dinner hours, you will wait 30 minutes........It is better to go early and not get frustrated and enjoy the food."
