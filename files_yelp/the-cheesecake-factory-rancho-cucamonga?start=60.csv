Jolie F.,"Simi Valley, CA",14,37,7,2.0,11/10/2017,"Our dinner at the Cheesecake Factory was a far cry from perfect. We ordered our usual items and disappointment with all but dessert. Let's start with service: initially our waitress was attentive and then we felt deserted! No refills offered for awhile. Then food was brought out by another person and we were never asked if we liked our food. The Santa Fe Salad was supposed to have chicken and other stuff, but chicken was a little light in proportion to salad. You shouldn't state chicken on salad if you have to hunt for it! The spicy cashew chicken was salty. Way too much hoisan sauce on the food. Wrong proportion of sauce to rice. The dessert of course was good! Thank goodness for chocolate cake!!!!"
SueAnn C.,"Newport Beach, CA",174,23,21,1.0,6/20/2017,"Just had the worse experience here . We came for the ""happy hour"" in the bar area and got there right at 4 .. the entire area was empty. It took 10 minutes for someone to come over and get our drink order. The same girl then took our food order and I think forgot to even put it in . We watched people walk in and sit and eat and we were still waiting for our food !!! She was soo clueless and didn't even realize we did not get our food yet . So we asked her to check on it , then out it came . We asked her for some ranch after she dropped off the food.. she never brought it. Asked for refills she never brought it. Someone else brought us a Togo box and  our check. This place needs ALOT of training . Will not return here ."

Friday night 15 minute wait.... everyone was so pleasant to be around ,all the workers, all the servers everyone was just so nice. Outside Patio atmosphere was amazing!! Miranda F. Was truly a jewel ! Miranda F. was our server for the night. Miranda F.was absolutely adorable!! I enjoyed the club sandwich and my Husband enjoyed the factory Burrito Grande . Let me share with You about the fresh bread with butter .....Wow !!! The bread was fresh out the oven and so full of taste with great freshness!!! The food here at the Cheesecake Factory 12379 North Mainstreet Rancho Cucamonga was really fresh and delicious.  We will be back again soon."
Ashia W.,"Garden Grove, CA",10,24,,5.0,10/26/2017,"We have always had a great experience at Cheesecake, but tonight was exceptional! Chris was fantastic , friendly, and attentive! Our out of town guest has the best time!  Thank you Chris!!!!"
Diana M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,1.0,11/11/2017,"2nd visit to this location and most definitely my LAST!! After waiting 1 1/2 hour wait to be seated, my order ""was taken to another table"" 20 min later I said cancel my order. And my order was to be removed from my bill and I was charged twice for it and only was removed. Waitress then call "" The Manager"" Graham and this guy instead of fixing the problem decides to sit and argue back with me!!! So unprofessional- with NO management skills at ALL. We then get another manager on duty Ryan.. and Ryan was so understanding listen to my frustration and tried his best to fix the situation.  Ryan thank you for listening to me vent as I was very frustrated and hungry. But this left a very bad taste to me and don't ever plan on returning!"
The Cienfuegos '.,"Brea, CA",0,6,1,1.0,5/17/2017,"Had the worst experience at this particular Cheesecake Factory on 5/13/17.  Went in with a girlfriend of mine at 7:30pm and was told the wait was an hour and a half. While that was quite steep we understood since it was mothers day weekend and waiting accordingly. When our table finally got called the time was 9:00pm so you can imagine we were starving at this point! Our waitress came around and dropped off our menu's and took our drink order. When she came back we told her we were ready to order. We ordered 1 appetizer and 2 entrees (the same dish). 30 mins later a food runner dropped off our appetizer. Our waitress NEVER came back to check on us till an hour later, and the only reason she did was because she was going on break and another waitress was going to be taking over. My friend and i were trying our best to be patient but an hour and half wait for food is just ridiculous! We asked our new waitress what was the ETA of the food, and that it had been an hour and a half at this point and she was in total shock as well that we had waited so long. The waitress came back with our ticket and said it must have gotten lost in the back somehow and was extremely apologetic and offered us a complimentary cheesecake. She even offered to get the manager for us. But that's where things turned. The manager came over, 'Issy' and we calmly explained to him that we had been waiting a total of 3 hours and just wanted to see what happened to our meals. He stated that he talked to his waitress and she said we NEVER order any entrees. Now why in the world would we sit at our table for an hour and a half never ordering a thing? His tone was absolutely appalling! Especially as a manger and was basically insinuating that we were lying. Horrible customer service on his part!  At that point we told them just send the check so we could get out of there. To add insult to injury this particular night we were celebrating my bday and being newly engaged!!! Horrible horrible horrible experience!"
Monique T.,"Fontana, CA",866,43,41,3.0,10/16/2017,Can't believe I had to bag my own food. Don't get me wrong. If that's the standard I'm cool but it's not. Tonight was just not the best service. Maybe I'll try again next week as I'm a regular and typically get better customer care. Better luck next time
Angel F.,"Ontario, CA",0,4,2,3.0,8/27/2017,"First and foremost it was very crowded, which may have been a good sign. The food was good but not GREAT, so you don't really get what you paid for considering how pricey it can get. It's a nice restaurant, service is great, food was underwhelming and expensive but over all I had a good time. I don't actively recommend it but if you're willing to spend the time waiting and the money then I'd say why not?  Lovely service"
Maria D.,"Upland, CA",19,3,,1.0,11/9/2017,"This place not only has bad service but also food is disgusting and cold! I ordered the four cheese pasta with chicken. It was very bland and cold, I definitely did not want to tip them anything! Only reason we did was because my husband always tips. Will never eat here again ... I could go on complaining but I'll leave it at that."
Zach L.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",43,22,,1.0,11/10/2017,"Already knocking down this review to one star due to the longer than expected wait that the manager/whoever was at the front gave us, as well as the fact that the only person who gets my order right isn't here. If the waitress we have messes up my order, I'll be sure to leave another scathing review here."
Martina R.,"San Bernardino, CA",0,4,2,3.0,3/2/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory is a chain restaurant with good food and a superb dessert selection. The restaurant decoration is unique, artistic and very appealing. Let's start with the PROS:  -Desserts:! I'm in love with their cheesecake. Always flavorful, creamy and fresh. I also love their Strawberry Shortcake , it's to die for. Key Lime Cheesecake is quite different to other cheescakes I have tried. Finally, Banana Cream Cheesecake is just the best dessert in the world. Their entrees and appetizers also do the trick for me, I've tried many of them and they don't disappoint, main courses are good but not as good as the cheesecakes and desserts the restaurant sells. For main course I like the Bang Bang Chiken and Shrimp the most; it has a coconut curry sauce, rice and chicken. -Parking. I love being able to eat and not having to worry about my car being parked in the street. -Their drinks: The amount of alcohol the drinks have is huge. Get 2 Mai Thais and you'll be hell of drunk. The CONS: -Service: Does not match the food the restaurant has. -Wait: Always packed, they need to expand and make more space so that we do not wait 2 hours for a table. A few positive things and food bad ones, probably 3.5 stars would be fair if it was possible. Although the restaurant is not as bad as other chain restaurants still needs a lot of improvement to reach 5 stars."
Felicia M.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",605,268,842,5.0,10/10/2016,"5pm dinners are my new thing!  Okay so I may sound like I should be ordering from the senior menu but there are perks.  1. You miss the dinner rush. 2. You eat early enough to still have enough time to burn off all the goodness you ate.  3. You can make it back home in time to catch all of your shows.  Seriously guys, especially at a place like CF you gotta go for the early bird. It's the only way to go.  This location is just as beautiful as the rest of them. The hostess was a little dry but I don't want to be picky. Once we were seated our server was great.  After that it was food heaven. We got the factory nachos, a chicken dish that was basically lightly breaded chicken that had a lemony flavor served with mashed potatoes and asparagus and my son got the chicken sliders. Oh, and how can I forget the complimentary bread basket! Everything was delicious. The nachos were so good! The chicken was yummy and way too much for one person and my son liked his sliders.  Cheesecake is one of those places that you can come back to again and again and order something new every time. This particular location was on point!"
P. C.,"Los Angeles, CA",32,316,196,5.0,9/17/2017,"I've been to many Cheesecake Factories (CF) but today's visit and review is mainly based on the exceptional service executed by our server Danielle!  I hope management sees this and commends her on a job well done.  She was very friendly, kept our glasses full, checked on us at the right times and got us whatever we needed within a very fast period.  And the restaurant was pretty full too so to get this level of attention was astonishing especially since we were a large group of 10!  She really made our return home from Vegas a delight.  I would ask for her next time we go back."
Melissa A.,"San Marino, CA",74,3,,1.0,9/28/2017,"I met my daughter at Cheesecake Factory today at Victoria Gardens.  I ordered the Skinnylicious Mexican Tortilla Salad.  It comes with: Crispy Corn Tortilla topped with grilled chicken breast and black beans with mixed greens, fresh corn, tomatoes, green onion, cilantro.  All tossed in the Skinnylicious Vinaigrette and garnished with a little avocado cream sauce, salsa and sour cream. I was starving and after waiting almost 30 minutes, the food came.  After a few bites, I noticed this was not the salad I had ordered in the past so I picked up a menu to see if maybe they had changed the salad.  Nope.  However my Salad included: Iceberg lettuce  Corn Tomatoes  I finally flagged down the waitress and pointed out the missing items.  She apologized and told me the ""chef isn't too bright and must not have read the ingredients.""  She took the plate and returned saying that another one was being made.  Well we were on a bit of a schedule as my daughter had to return to school so I told her I really didn't want another salad, but she said it was already beating made and I basically didn't have a choice.  So I told her to make it to go.  I was actually surprised that she still charged me for it even though she knew I clearly didn't want it since I knew I had errands to run and it was going to sit in my car in the heat for at least four hours.  But, not wanting to complain and embarrass my daughter, I took the salad knowing it was going to end up being thrown away.  Funny thing, when I got home, I opened it up and under all the wilted lettuce, there was still more than half the ingredients missing.  I think my family, friends, and I will be steering clear of the Victoria Garden's Cheesecake Factory in the future."
Karla G.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",48,21,25,5.0,10/16/2017,"I loved the pasta it was so yummy I had the four cheese pasta and I added shrimp to it , I also had the cucumber mojito which was just perfect ! I will definitely return for some drinks and good food so happy with my meal and staff is just so friendly and helpful"
Ali I.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",20,2,,1.0,10/13/2017,"It was a bad experience. We ordered 2 shrimp scampi and steak diane and one shrimp scampi and salmon. First, the order took too long to come. Second, when it came, it was the wrong order for the 3 plates. They took the orders and we waited for another 30 mins. The orders didn't come in the same time, some had to eat and others waited for their plates, so we were all upset about the service and we called the manager whose name is Paul. He offered us one slice of a cheesecake for three of us as an apology!! His apology was even more disrespectful to us, so we refused to take it and we left. The manager name is Paul."
Anjanette S.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",24,93,367,4.0,9/2/2016,"One of the more popular chain restaurants at Victoria Gardens so of course it's busy.  We were seated quickly and serviced by a funny and friendly waitress that brought out our drinks quickly, had great food suggestions and brought all the waiters to loudly sing happy birthday to us. Two candles, fun! The food  was excellent,  we got the shrimp platter and traded the coleslaw for broccoli, delicious! I guess we were in a seafood kinda mood so we also ordered calamari and fish and chips, also good. To break things up, we ordered the orange chicken, it comes with fluffy white rice and snow peas, delicious! The only slip is the drinks, they are pricey and weak, we aren't heavy drinkers, but don't expect anything here, they definitely hold back and it's tacky,  this crowd is willing to pay, you don't have to cheat them. Will we be back? Of course, easy parking, good atmosphere and the desserts are fool proof!"
Cnd M.,"Victorville, CA",13,22,6,1.0,9/22/2017,"Hubby and I got a gift card so we decided to try it, my first time here, he'd been before many years ago.  Wait time was short which was nice.  And that was it.  Our bread came out cold, the fried cauliflower was okay.  We ate all that and still waited for main food to come out which was quite a long time since restaurant was not busy.  Husband ordered the avocado chicken club,  chicken was cold and so was his bacon which leads us to believe the food is pre cooked,  I ordered the veggie patty on sourdough bread my patty was cold as well and the french fries look like they came out of a frozen bag from smart and final.  Not impressed and will not be back."
M.tess C.,"Walnut, CA",22,48,1,1.0,4/19/2017,"I've given this place too many chances! I knew I should've stopped coming here when one time I came for dinner the server lost my debit card. How do you lose a customer's debit card from the table to the register?!  A few weeks ago I called in to inquire about ordering a whole cheesecake for my husband's birthday. The worker said I can just come in and pick it up without preordering and that they could write on it too. I told him exactly what I wanted written and he said they can definitely do it. So I rush home from work the next day and try to order the cheesecake with what I wanted written on it only to be told they couldn't do it.  Their lame response to me after telling them I had called in to double check was, ""Some of the workers here don't know."" Well if the workers are incompetent, then they need to go.  Too bad my friends and I have to find another place to meet for dinner since this Cheesecake Factory is a waste of time and money."
Judy L.,"San Jose, CA",278,10,,3.0,10/3/2017,"Service was okay, my friend treated me out to dinner, the food was also okay, overall if you are in a pinch and don't want to spend money at Flemings, this place is just fine."
