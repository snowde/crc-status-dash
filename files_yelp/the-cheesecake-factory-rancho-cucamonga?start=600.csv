Brett R.,"Victorville, CA",1199,703,19,3.0,1/25/2013,"Always a sucky ass wait to get in, but the food is good, portions are HUGE...... and the cheesecake. oh god the cheesecake....... it's almost as good as sex. and sex is good."
Angelina R.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,81,88,3.0,1/3/2015,"Always a great choice.  Food is always good and the servers are always great.  I would give them five stars, except every time I order the stuffed mushrooms, I ALWAYS have to send them back because they are frozen in the center.  They always reheat and the second time they come out - perfect!  (This takes away one star). I would like to see them change up the menu and do a better job on kid choices.  The chicken strips for kids are very tasteless.  (minus 1/2 star).  Everything else is great!  Cheesecake is always a great choice and great coffee!  My last visit, my coffee cup had food and a lip stick imprint on the cup.  I was not wearing lip stick.  I requested the server to bring me a clean cup and she looked at me like I was crazy.  (minus 1/2 star).  Patio seating is a great option and with heater lamps, the weather does not matter. I recommend the larger patio over the small patio.  Even in the wind, the set up in the larger patio is user friendly so the cold and the wind is not a problem. The small patio tends to have more people standing outside smoking, which ruins the patio seating.  Also the small patio is located next to curbside pick up so you get the exhaust from the cars that are left running.  This location has free parking and valet.  You can also choose meter parking, just bring quarters.  Meters will take a maximum of eight quarters giving you 2-hours of parking.  This location gets packed anytime after 12:30 pm, so go early for lunch.  Dinner gets packed after 3 pm."
Jen A.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",68,159,23,4.0,6/28/2011,"The food is delicious, yet I try to avoid their crowded lines during the weekends and at nights. Their portions are huge, and it is a little pricey. I usually come here when I get gift certificates to pay for most of my food. Been coming to this place for 5 years and never had a complaint. Customer service is friendly and the wait time for the meals don't usually take long. Great for lunches or a night around town."
Adam F.,"Rialto, CA",0,13,,2.0,2/11/2014,"Usually a good experience there but they are becoming very complacent in their great location with almost guaranteed customer flow. They are slacking in the area of customer service beginning at the hostess desk. People are treated like cattle, ""stand over here was dictated over and over again with no smile and no eye contact. I guess people don't care for the most part.  Once we were seated we were forgotten as many others were seated and had orders taken while I ""rubber-necked"" to look for someone that might care. I finally got up and informed a manager. She took our order and offered a complimentary appetizer of which we were billed for. I am unimpressed with a few of their managers that lack customer service skills. Most of the waiting and serving staff are main reason we go back.  Corporate needs to send in some ""SPY's""  let's shuffle some folks and shake this place up. Adam F."
Ryan M.,"Fontana, CA",216,28,7,5.0,9/30/2013,"I really enjoy this place, it's clean, the service is good and I've liked everything I've ordered.  I recently tried the Mac n cheese burger at the is an explosion of flavor, I will definitely get that again.  Dessert if you love cheesecake this is the spot and the carrot cake cheesecake is the real deal."
Ralph O.,"Chino Hills, CA",253,620,67,3.0,8/28/2012,"I like Cheescake Factory, but I can never decide to what get with their huge menu. We came here for lunch and I got the Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic which is pasta in a creamy sauce with chicken. I thought the pasta was undercooked and they weren't very generous with the chicken. The service was slow but that wasn't because our waitress wasn't trying. It appears that Cheesecake has the wait staff overwhelmed with all sorts of duties rather than have more staff.  I still like Cheesecake just not my last experience here."
WhittierSoccer W.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,15,,2.0,11/16/2013,"No wait to sit outdoors but what they don't tell you is you have to deal with slow service, freeze because their heaters do not work and then have to go up to the front just to get some help because the waitress is not capable. The only person that saved a star was Bryan up front who found us a new spot in 1/8 of the time the waitress did and we only had to ask once. The food is usually good but the service continues to dwindle every time we go so no more cheesecake factory for us sadly."
Ann S.,"Winter Garden, FL",2,25,2,5.0,7/8/2011,Love this place. All the food is good. Atmosphere is fun and cheery. Great priced kids menus!! Take the kids. Huge portions on all menus. Walk Victoria Gardens after a good meal Enjoy~
Jack S.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",11,291,159,4.0,2/28/2011,"We live near Victoria Gardens, and have been to the Cheesecake Factory many times, and it is a family favorite. The only thing that keeps us from going more often is the extreme wait, but when you're in the mood and willing to wait, this is well worth it! We always call ahead of time to see what the wait is like, sometimes you'd be surprised at how fast you can get in even on a weekend night.  This last Saturday we went to Cheesecake Factory to celebrate my wife's birthday, and I now have a new favorite dish! They had a specials menu, with about 12 or 15 different things (of course their specials menu would be huge when the regular menu is like 15 PAGES!). I went for the Chicken Bellagio, breaded chicken cutlets over basil spaghettini (the best I can describe it, it was thicker than angel hair and thinner than spaghetti), in a cream sauce. It was served with two big slices of prosciutto and a little arugula and parmesan cheese. It was delicious! Every piece worked so well together. The arugula was a nice touch on top, and with each bite gave a nice fresh taste to balance the cream sauce, and the breading on the chicken was light, and not greasy or heavy at all. We started with Avocado Egg Rolls, which is our go-to appetizer, and is always delicious and indulgent (even if avocados are good fat, theres a LOT of fat in this dish!) We finished dinner off with a slice of Adam's caramel peanut butter cheesecake, which was delicious as well. I haven't had a bad meal at any Cheesecake Factory, we sometimes pick up food or just cheesecake to go, and the service is quick and easy, if you don't want to wait for a table on a busy night. My favorite entrees (besides Chicken Bellagio now) are the Spicy Crispy Beef and the Jambalaya.  Call ahead so you know what you're looking at for a wait time, pick up your buzzer when you check in for a table, and do what we always do, and if the wait is longer than 30 minutes, go next door to Crate and Barrel or do any other shopping in Victoria Gardens."
Kathy S.,"La Verne, CA",0,11,,2.0,1/22/2015,"Went to celebrate my birthday. This restaurant is usually crowded on weekends so we went on a Wed. nite instead of Saturday nite (my actual birthday) in order to beat the crowds.  Big mistake!  It wasn't crowded when we got there about 6:30 p.m. but got very crowded as we were waiting for a table.  My husband told them we were celebrating my birthday.  We were not given a pager, but I noticed other folks checking in after us got pagers.  A female employee was calling out names to seat people, but you could hardly hear her because of the loud music and general noise in the restaurant.  We were told there would be a 15 minute wait and they actually called us at 15 minutes, but they took us to a tiny two-fer table near the kitchen next to a large party on one side, and a wall on the other.  The kitchen was directly behind us.  My husband requested another table and the hostess said we would have to wait, so we decided to wait.  We asked for a booth, but they said the booths were only for parties of 4 or more.  (Don't expect to be seated at a booth if there is only two of you--their seating policy is not customer-friendly and leaves much to be desired.)  Thirty-five minutes after we had arrived, we were seated at another tiny table-for-two between a large party and another couple.  Too close to these tables in my opinion.  Barely enough room on the table to hold the bread, appetizers, and entrees, and drinks that we ordered  And after being seated for a few minutes I noticed my shoes were sticking to the floor under the table.  Ewwwww! Food was fantastic!  We ordered Stuffed Mushrooms and Chicken Samosas as appetizers, I ordered the Tuscan Chicken as my entrée,  my husband ordered the French Dip sandwich, and we ordered one piece of cheesecake to go.  They didn't do the ""birthday thing"" for me, though they were doing it for other customers around us.  My guess is they were so busy they completely forgot about it. No big thing for me, but it might have been for someone else.  We had gift cards given to us for Christmas that we paid with, so they only thing we paid cash for was the tip.  Good thing, because I don't think I would shell out any money to this restaurant Great food or not. Three stars.  Pros:  Good food, good service, fast service Cons:  1. Frenetic, barn-like atmosphere.  ""Ambiance"" music is too loud, as a result people had to talk louder to have a conversation, thus creating an uncomfortable din throughout the entire restaurant.    2. Not enough employees to bus and clean the vacated tables,  making customers wait much longer than necessary.   3. No seating at a booth unless you have a party of 4 or more when the restaurant is busy.  The seating layouts in this restaurant really stink.  The tables are so close together you can't avoid bumping elbows with the stranger at the table next to you, or hearing their conversations.  Not exactly my idea of a nice dinner in a restaurant.   4. Only giving out pagers to certain customers, and not to others.   5. Dirty, sticky floors!"
Joseph A.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,2,,5.0,11/1/2014,The restaurant is overbooking customers. The wait for 1 hour. Placing an order took another 45 minutes. My 3 kids who are starving and just lost their appetite. The only answer the manager can tell me that our order will be out in a few more minutes. I can't understand this restaurant overbooked without thinking how to resolve major delays to serve customer.. I don't think this should be the kind of restaurant that our family should go.
Temyka J.,"Cypress, CA",128,37,17,5.0,2/16/2013,Tried the lunch portion of the Louisiana Chicken and loved it. I am always satisfied when I dine here.
Isela G.,"Murrieta, CA",60,37,3,2.0,8/10/2012,"Went here for my b-day. I actually come here often as it is a half way point for my friends and I. Anyway, everything was fine until I got up. I walked down the isle and slipped on water or something. Fell hard on my knee in front of tons of people. Pretty embarrassing. A staff member  quickly helped along with a customer. The manager came by asked if I was okay. I explained I was okay, my knee hurt and I was embarrassed. He apologized and walked away. I was upset because he didn't even offer to comp us anything and didn't even take a report. Very unprofessional. I'll take my business elsewhere. The two stars are for the food."
Yuka N.,"Brea, CA",316,441,1699,4.0,10/31/2012,"personally, i love the cheesecake factory.  i've been 2 so many of them.  over the weekend, my best friend wanted 2 go eat here and shop at ontario mills afterwards.  we got there b4 noon on a sunday.  it wuzn't crowded at all, totally surprised. we waited about 10 min.  i love their honeywheat bran bread!!!  i can b very happy just eating that!  ok, and cheesecake 2!  we shared some kind of breaded chicken pesto pasta.  it wuz delicious but it wuz drenched w 2 much pesto olive oil sauce.  that's no way 2 eat pasta!  r waitress did not come back 2 ask how r food wuz after she served it.  we complained 2 the manager and he ended up deducting the pasta, which wuz about $15.  we also had the pumpkin cheesecake.  it wuz a lil mushy but other than that, it wuz good."
Rebecca N.,"Portland, OR",296,151,448,4.0,1/4/2011,"This Cheesecake is the same as all the other ones out there.  Came here and it was super busy. So when I put down my name and got my buzzer thing, I thought that the boyfriend and I could go to the parking lot real quick and drop off our goodies and still have time to wait. The most surprising thing was right when we dropped off the goodies and was in the vicinity for the buzzing thing to start buzzing...it buzzed instantly. Which was pretty awesome because normally I'm waiting there for like 15-45 minutes.  I decided to try a new dish, instead of getting my usual tomato basil pasta, I got the chicken piccata. It was freaking delicious! If you don't like lemons, stay away. This dish is loaded with lemon flavor. And I think it tastes great with the light cream sauce they paired it with. The chicken and pasta were cooked perfectly. And I also got a clam chowder. That was good too, it was the perfect balance between cream, potatoes, and clams.  Our waiter dude was really nice. He refilled both of drinks in a jiffy. It was kind of weird because he was also his serving his mom and sister right next to us. Hahahah.  Overall I had a nice time."
Mark F.,"San Dimas, CA",3,29,10,5.0,7/22/2013,I went here with my mom last night... The food is bomb. Huge Menu! I will have to come back 100 times to try everything. Thanks Mom
Mike S.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,32,,4.0,1/3/2015,One of our goto places.  Always great food and friendly staff.  Can't go wrong with happy hour menu.  I only wish they had a larger tap list.
Amber S.,"Running Springs, CA",4,15,2,2.0,7/15/2011,"We've eaten here a few other times and the food is always great, however the service last night was...not so great.  We sat down, and ordered our drinks, and our food with our drinks. We were trying to make it to a movie, so we wanted to put the order in quickly. The waiter said he would be back with our bread......he never brought the bread. We saw him numerous other times, and he still never brought the bread. Now I can understand ""the bread is still in the oven,"" ""we just ran out"" ect... but there was a couple sitting next to us, and their server managed to wrangle up some bread... Anyways, our food came...then we asked another waiter if we could also have some bread. Bread finally came, and it was overcooked, too much to the point you couldn't even eat in... It took forever for the server to come clear our plates and cash us out. It could be because he was new, or unexperienced, or so forth, but just made for an unpleaseant dinning experience.. The food we order was really good, like always there and we had their ""special"" Reeces peanut butter cake/cheesecake. Really really good! Just be warned, it's very rich! My husband and I shared it, and couldn't even finish all of it.  Altogether the food was good, the service however was not."
Natalie G.,"Victorville, CA",214,175,76,4.0,7/30/2012,"Good food, great service, quick on refills BUT there is quite a wait and also the waiting room is VERY small and awkwardly placed in front of the bakery. Other than that I like the place WAY more than the one in Riverside, The service is on a whole other level."
Irene D.,"Azusa, CA",14,4,2,1.0,8/29/2013,Horrible! Dishes and silverware were dirty. Napkin smelled like grease. Food doesn't even fit on the tiny dish they give. It was so cold that I was shaking and used that stinky napkin to cover myself and had no other napkin to use to wipe my hands. This was my first visit and definitely my last.
