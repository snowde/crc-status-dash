Frank B.,"Chino Hills, CA",0,147,1,2.0,2/12/2013,Hostess was rude...waitress was ok...service rates a 2-3.  Food solid 3.
Lisa S.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",7,45,18,3.0,4/19/2010,"Let's just start by saying they have some good food but just too much options. They could use some simplifying but whatever. I do have to say there are quite a few cheesecakes that almost makes up for the lack of service and taste of food. This particular location last year was okay. However, it's gotten so much worse. Try calling in an order around 7:30pm on Wednesday night, they had me waiting 15 minutes before I had to call back and ask for the bakery again. Another time, they got on the phone twice asking whom I was holding for and twice told them I was holding for the bakery so that I can place an order. So the bakery is overwhelmed personally and think the hostess should be taking orders as they have nothing to do! I see the bakery usually have 1-2 people working the station but always super busy whether it's getting change for the waiters to preparing the desserts to preparing the take out orders. On top of which they are helping customers that walk in. While this was going on, there were two hostesses not doing anything. Come on, how hard is it to see where they can seat people as there were very few people walking in to dine. Not to mention 1 extra hostess that physically show you to the table.  Anyways, I go back for the cheesecake mainly as the food is only mediocre at best."
James A.,"Los Angeles, CA",76,181,2,2.0,7/23/2012,The Cheesecake Factory should be called the Cheese Cake Factory: And other foods that you will tolerate for our cheesecake.
Jennifer H.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,2,,3.0,9/29/2013,Love the environment and people there! The gumbo is not authentic but pretty smooth and not too rich for dinner.
Melinda W.,"Fontana, CA",0,4,,5.0,9/23/2013,"My best friend and I came here for drinks and ended up being so pleasantly surprised! Usually its a long wait and servers who forget about you but our server went above and beyond. Even at the end of a long eight hour shift he made out experience personable and perfect. If you go to cheesecake make sure you ask for Trevor! He was perfect! While providing quality efficient service even at the end he added great touched. I wanted to box my bread and he gave me an entire loaf of the wheat bread to take home!!! So wonderful and very modest. I would highly reccomend coming here. Great service, great food, what more can you ask??"
J M.,"Foothill Ranch, CA",95,268,50,5.0,4/20/2010,"I LOVE LOVE LOVE the Cheesecake Factory.  They give me a cute little complimentary toddler plate to start, if you don't get one, ask for it. Everything I've ever ordered has been delicious,  and the desserts are awesome, but I think their coffee is weak.  Try these sometime: appetizers -avocado eggrolls, chicken lettuce wraps, bruschetta.  Meals-bistro shrimp pasta, farfalle pasta, bang bang chicken, Jambalaya, the Thai one can't remember the name. Also the chicken costoletta...or something spelled like it.  Salads are great,  really like the one with the seared ahi tuna, and the French something salad.  The CF vinegarette is really good, its my favorite dressing ever!  Desserts -both versions of the carrot cake & tiramisu, banana cream cheese cake, coconut cream cheese cake, Chris's outrageous chocolate cake. And the list goes on. Have fun! I know your stomach will. P.s. try the red velvet cheesecake.  TO DIE FOR."
Greg S.,"Ithaca, NY",1,133,,3.0,5/29/2012,"Ate here for the first time.  I'd been to Cheesecake Factory establishments in Las Vegas, NV and Thousand Oaks, CA before.  I thought that this CF was a bit off.  A touch slow, food was a bit less enjoyable than other CF experiences.  That said, it wasn't bad by any stretch, and we'd go again in a heartbeat."
Dan P.,"Los Angeles, CA",288,202,382,3.0,3/31/2010,"After spending 3 hours reading the menu, I got overwhelmed and decided to let the server bring a random reccomendation.  The meal started off with the brown and white breads  and just like most things in life, brown is better! The first plate brought out wasn't even on the menu, Tamale Cakes. It's like a tamale, but shaped like a crab cake and topped with mango salsa and cream. One of the best appetizers ever. That was followed by an unbelievably huge plate of breaded chicken with bowtie pasta, which was also delicious.  Finally the meal was finished with Strawberry Cheesecake, simply the best.  Overall I enjoyed the meal alot, but take away 2 stars for the SLOW as molassus service and the slightly expensive meal."
Misty H.,"Murrieta, CA",6,11,1,1.0,2/23/2014,"Went to this Cheesecake last night for my SIL's birthday. We all drove about an hour to  meet at this location. We waited almost 2 hours to get a seat, but thats not a big deal, we went and walked around the mall for a while to pass time. When we finally got a seat, we waited almost 20 minutes to even get a drink order placed. When we finally got to order, we all ordered simple things. No special orders. But after more than 40 mins we still hadn't received our appetizer. We asked to speak to a manager, and she came over. What do ya know, 2 mins later we get our app, and 5 mins later our food. But the food was warm, not hot. My niece was never offered ketchup and when the waitress walked by and she put up her hand to ask for some the server said Hi and just kept walking. We asked for an extra plate, and that took 5 minutes. The server never really asked how the food was. We complained twice to the manager, and they did comp the app and let us decide on gratuity, but that was it. The manager never came back to follow up and make sure everything went well the rest of the night.  I'm very disappointed! We had the worst service I have ever had at a restaurant! Overall, if it were possible to give no stars, i would! And this is not a cheesecake location I would return to!"
Elizabeth O.,"Williamsburg, VA",183,663,136,4.0,7/10/2012,"Easy to find, usually not too busy, and they have a great brunch.  Their orange juice is really good."
Brandon A.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",62,69,2,3.0,8/29/2012,"The wife would probably give this place 5 stars, since it is her favorite place to eat.  I am not ever that impressed with it.  Don't get me wrong, the food is excellent and the service is mostly great as well. Some of the prices are a little hefty though, and their drink prices are astronomical. The menu is so HUGE though that I always have trouble deciding what to eat.  Also for some reson most of the time I go there I leave with some awful heartburn, even though I don't eat anything spicy.  Their cheesecake is a great finisher to a meal."
carolin b.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,3,,1.0,8/22/2014,So we love cheese cake in LA and figured we visit cheese cake in Victoria garden.  The waiter was very nice but he totally forgot to place one of our orders in.... After sitting for a while hungry he came back and when we asked for our dinner he said he thought we have canceled it????..He didn't even say I am sorry. .The cheese cake in LA would sure comp a desert for a mess up like this.  Sorry. .... not going back to this one again.  The manager was so care less about it as well.
Erwin C.,"Las Vegas, NV",10,23,3,5.0,4/13/2012,"Excellent customer service!  i left my credit card there on my way home to Las Vegas and they sent my card overnight with no charge at all!  In an atmosphere of bad to mediocre service, it great to know that good customer service still exists!  A huge thank you to the staff and especially Ms. Lambert for her assistance! Cheesecake Factory in Victoria Gardens now has a life long patron!"
Carmen G.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,10,,2.0,7/28/2015,"Service was bad and the food was cold.  My family (husband, and two young boys) and I went to dinner last Friday night. After waiting for our food for almost an hour, the server comes to our table and informs us that our food will be delayed because of computer problems.  Frustrated and hungry at this point, he  offers us a salad and more bread, which we accept.  Fifteen minutes latter, no salad, no additional bread, but our meals come out.  My chicken medria was cold. My husband and I speak to the manager, who completely approaches the situation in an unprofessional manner, with no apology given.  We declined to accept the free cheesecake he was giving us, and he quickly dismissed us and walked away, stating he could nothing else for us.  How about starting out with an apology for the delay in telling customers that there was a problem in delivery of food in the first place, in addition to poor service. This Cheesecake factory is located in Victoria Gardens, where there are alot of other choices for wonderful dinning."
Sandra M.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,21,3,1.0,7/27/2014,"My family and I had dinner at the cheesecake factory tonight.. I must say it was an awful experience. We have been to this location several times and always had excellent service, but tonight.. everything was awful. First off, we were told the wait would be 25-30 min for our party of 5 and it took 1 hour. We kept watching people who came in to the restaurant after us, get seated before us. When my husband went up to the host to check what was taking so long, he was told they were waiting for a party to leave so we could be seated inside but if we wanted to sit outside we would be seated right away. The host seemed very bothered when answering my husband's question. We did not want to sit outside with our kids because it was a very hot, humid day. Once we were finally seated we told the server we wanted to order everything (drinks, appetizers, and entrees at once because we waited so long and were starving). When I ordered my food I asked for it without sour cream and the waiter made a joke and said extra sour cream and then said he was kidding.. and to top it all off, when I got my order.. there was a big glop of sour cream on it so I had to send it back  and wait longer. Towards the end of the meal we asked for boxes and even that took long to receive. The service was so slow and disappointing today."
J T.,"Fontana, CA",4,93,40,5.0,7/25/2012,"I absolutely love it here. Portions are huge and prices are fair. The last couple dishes I ordered were awesome...and I never had it before. I recommend you try different things every time. My husband had this amazing friend chicken nuggets and I had battered shrimp with pasta and it was so good. I've been coming here for years and finally just tried ordering random other things. I did order the ahi tuna and it was not edible, it was too spicy and there was too much dressing on the salad.  But definetly will come back again, it a great place for kids because it's so noisy that your kid won't be heard . Which is a plus"
Diwata P.,"Fontana, CA",54,288,11,4.0,9/22/2009,"As a chain restaurant, I love the Cheesecake Factory. They have big menu where you can always try something different every time you go, but I still stick my favorites. We ordered the Navajo (one of my favorites) and the Chinese Chicken Salad. Both were excellent. Sadly, the Chinese Chicken Salad isn't good as a leftover. =( Because we were full from our meal, we didn't have a chance to try the desserts this time around. Next time (or maybe later this week), I'm gonna try the red velvet cheesecake. It just looked so delicious sitting in the display case. I wonder how much gym time I have to put in to have one of those. The only negative thing I had to say about our latest experience, our server sucked. It seemed like he didn't want to work that day. At least his relief was much more chippier."
Tiffany R.,"Hesperia, CA",51,13,,3.0,12/21/2012,"While yes the cheesecakes are very good, I find the meals not that great.  The prices are a little high, especially for the amount of food you get (which isn't a lot).  The wait times can be long.  They are friendly and the time you wait for your food, even while it's busy, is not bad."
Lori D.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",6,53,52,4.0,6/23/2012,"Food is good, service could be better. The 4 stars are for the food, the service deserves about 3 stars. If you go to have dinner, put warm clothes on because it's freezing inside. Maybe the management is reading this review and changes the inside temperature, so we can all enjoy our diner."
