Alicia O.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",68,77,1,5.0,5/6/2012,"I've always been a fan of these cheesecakes and their food is also very delicious. I suggest going in for lunch and ordering off the lunch menu, it's low calorie and easy on the wallet."
Mishka T.,"Ontario, CA",37,5,3,4.0,2/18/2013,"Went here last night for dinner,wait was 35 minutes. Oh we'll were here already my husband said plus traffic here is not nice so by the time we went somewhere else it would of equal the same time to wait. Service was good,food was good. Can't go wrong with this place. A little too commercial."
Bob C.,"CA, CA",132,755,415,1.0,4/21/2009,"I have always thought the only reason to come to the Cheesecake Factory was, well, for the cheesecakes.  So, why did I come here, eat, and leave sans cheesecake? After a long arduous day of work, I look up and it's almost 9:35 p.m.  Options for eating were greatly constricted.  The CFO & I make our way to King's Fish House because it's close and they close on the later side.  Oops, closed.  Damn.  Now what?  I guess it's gonna be a trek to the 24 hour IHOP in La Verne.  Then we drove by Cheesecake Factory, I thought, hey why not.  It's been awhile... Well, I learned one very important thing today.  I do not like arugula.  Never knew that.  I always had salads before and had a taste of something I didn't like, but never knew what it was.  Well, now I know.  Arugula, as in the beet, asparagus, & arugula salad.  Sadly, the beets were even tasteless.  Also sampled 2 other appetizers - bacon wrapped dates (the bacon wasn't crispy and the dates were really heavy and thick) & ahi tuna tartare (eh, the chips that were served with this dish didn't mesh with the dish for me, the crispiness of the chips really conflicted with the softness of the tuna and avocado). For my meal, I was recommended the meatloaf.  Quick aside, but how many freakin' SPECIALTIES can the house make?  Really, that many? Anyways, the meatloaf was okay.  Some parts were kinda grisly.  The ""grilled"" onions were more boiled than grilled, yuck.  By the time we had eaten the appetizers and I finished a slice (there were 3) of my meatloaf I was already full and couldn't partake of any cheesecake.   Overall, I'd say, go eat someplace else and come here for the cheesecake."
Irma R.,"San Francisco, CA",40,409,9,4.0,12/2/2009,"Great little area, parking everywhere. There wasn't a wait, friendly staff, food always good."
Paula E.,"Upland, CA",7,14,1,1.0,9/2/2011,I won't be taking someone there again for their birthday.  First of all you have to ask for the free dessert ahead of time (I didn't since I had no clue about that).  When someone called me from the restaurant they indicated that the free dessert was ONLY two bites anyway -  what's the point then??  You think they could splurge  a little bit better than that for their customers.
Leigh A.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",25,30,5,2.0,2/9/2012,"I never really know what to order here, especially when trying to be ""good"" about not eating a million calories!  But if you are going to splurge save room for either a Reese's Peanut Butter cup cheesecake or one of the other chocolate/peanut butter cheesecakes.  On a side note they could really raise the temperature in this place.  I had to keep my jacket and hat on and was still cold.  I looked around and others were dressed the same and huddling over their plates...."
Ghislaine V.,"Irvine, CA",2,23,1,1.0,6/11/2011,"Worst service and staff I've ever encountered.  The waitress is rude and doesn't even give refills on drinks.  She didn't even check up on us once during the entire meal.  Plus, the service is slow - we had to wait 45 minutes for our entrees.  I love Cheesecake Factory - but not this location at Victoria Gardens.  It's a shame they have terrible service.  Management needs to train their staff better!!"
Jason J.,"Upland, CA",37,473,96,3.0,12/17/2009,"I've only gone to this Cheescake Factory (or any for that matter) once, and I was generally happy with my experience.  Part of the reason I'm only giving three stars is I only had the cheesecake, and albeit very good, I don't want to rate the restaurant as a whole on the cheesecake alone. I had heard, and it seems true, at least it was true in my case, that the Cheesecake Factory lives up to its namesake and does in fact have varied and delicious cheesecakes.  They also provide you with nutritional information.  I have to say, I don't know if this was good or not.  I mean: I enjoyed my cheesecake.  I imagine I would have enjoyed it more if I didn't have to consciously make the decision to ingest 1700 odd calories in one sitting, but on the other hand, I appreciate being able to make an informed decision.  So as far as cheesecake goes, I was very happy with what I ate, and I recommend it to friends and neighbours in search of a good slice of cheesecake."
Vic S.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",14,98,41,4.0,11/8/2010,First time we gotten good service at the Rancho location.  Had a wonderful birthday dinner.  As always the cheesecake was wonderful and food was excellent.     Had the chicken romano - Good but ask for extra sauce.
Stephanie P.,"Pomona, CA",155,626,331,3.0,10/4/2011,"#259 To be honest, I've gotten over the hype of chain restaurants. The same exact experience anywhere in the country? What's the point? But, I will admit that their cheesecake can be pretty fantastic when you're having a terrible day. Not to mention, if you're totally up for gorging yourself and doing away with the fitness plan you came up with in January, then Cheesecake Factory is totally your friend. Service, though, can be spotty. I've gotten good and bad waiters/waitresses at this particular location, but it's never been so terrible that I had to complain. It was more a lack of immediate attention that turned me off than anything else. I've only ventured to the Factory with friends and I would never consider going to one for date or just to grab lunch by myself."
Savannah F.,"Fontana, CA",0,1,,3.0,4/9/2014,"My family and I had dinner here tonight, my choice. This is usually one of my favorites, but tonight I had a different experience. I asked our server if they had raspberry iced tea, she told me yes. She then brought me strawberry lemonade and told me it was raspberry lemonade. (I tend to trust my taste buds) Then after finally getting our dinner, my Mac&cheese and broccoli was cold and our server came to check on us for the first time after I was already finished eating. The food runners/other servers took better care of us, as we only saw our waitress a total of 3 times including taking our drink/food order and dropping off the bill. I'm giving it 3 stars, not because of my experience tonight, but because of my love for the restaurant in general."
Sherry G.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,15,2,1.0,8/7/2013,"well I wasted my money...came here for lunch and was really hungry. They got my order wrong, so my food went back and my friends started eating 10 min before the correct order arrived. Pasta....not edible....the manager said it was al dente...but sorry it was not cooked all the way through. I am Italian and I know al dente! Gross:(  So they said they would take it back again...me thinks not! I know what happens when you return your order at a restaurant. I just ate the bread and paid for undercooked food that did not arrive on time and I did not eat.  They made no effort to make me happy. Please don NOT waste your time or money here!"
Sydney H.,"Riverside, CA",51,236,34,5.0,10/21/2011,I really enjoyed this place. It is great for the family or just to get out with some friends. I have never had a bad experiance with the cheescake factory and I  am pleased to have been pleased. Keep up the good work and finding good employees to keep your business at the top.
Chris P.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",1,24,3,3.0,2/27/2012,Tried the shrimp  shishito stuffed peppers. Tasty but greasy. Maybe a different batter would help. Otherwise a pleasant experience.
Della-Rae M.,"Fontana, CA",270,126,102,3.0,11/13/2012,Whenever I hear ppl talk bout the cheesecake factory they make it sound like the ish. So when my friend invited me to go to the cheesecake factory I was super hyped and excited to taste this 7th wonder lol. We went on a Sunday night it was crowded but our wait was probably like 25 min or 30 not long cuz we had fun lookin up dumb stuff on his phone. We were seated and our server was the best. She was super friendly and knew the menu really well. The bread was bomb. I would've just been happy wit the bread and butter. My friend ordered some edame (hope I spelled it right) and it was good. My tropical tea or passion tea was gross so I got the sweet green tea wit mint and I fell n love. I couldn't stop suckin those bad boys down. My friend ordered the four cheese pasta. He thought it was ok. I thought it tasted pretty good. I ordered the shrimp scampi and the salmon combination plate wit mashed potatoes. I liked the shrimp and mashed potatoes but the salmon was pretty gross. I love salmon but this didn't do it for me I was sad :( lol but I still ate it. Then after all tat food we shared the banana cheesecake which was awesome. I loooooove cheese cake and pie. I will stab a b**ch over some good cheesecake or pie :p would I come back? Yes I would but I would probably get soup and an appetizer to eat instead of any other meal.
Fern R.,"Upland, CA",140,411,74,4.0,7/31/2011,"Forget The Food Menu, Order And Eat The Cheesecake!!!  Why Bother With A Meal When The Cheesecake Is Filling Enough!!!  This Is A Dessert Restaurant, That's It..."
Johnny N.,"Anaheim, CA",174,787,1042,2.0,6/17/2009,"I personally like the Cheesecake Factory chain, but this location has issues. - Our appetizers took forever to come out. - Mainly because our server wasn't anywhere to be found, we weren't offered bread refills, drink refills, or an explanation. - When asked how big the cuts of steak were, we got BS ""I'm gonna cover up my lack of knowledge"" answers (ribeye = 8oz, regular filet = 6oz, small filet = 4oz). - When our appetizers finally came out, our entrees came out literally 3 minutes later.  WTF?  The server came up with some weak explanation of bad timing. - We had to ask 3 times for the outdoor heat lamp to be turned on. - Two of us ordered steak, yet we weren't given steak knives. Again our server wasn't around... we had to ask another server (who took care of his table just fine) for knives, and he brought them out.  Glad he was happy to help... but our steaks were now lukewarm.  Elapsed time = ~8 minutes. The food was good, typical CF quality.  But I'd be hard-pressed to come back here."
Mike L.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",83,1291,17,4.0,7/5/2009,"came here for lunch today with my wife and daughter, we had a $25 giftcard :-) I ordered a burger because i couldnt make up my mind on what i wanted. Way to many things on the menu. My wife ordered the navajo which i wanted to try but i was to stuffed by the time i remember. My burger was huge and very good. i had to take half of it home and so did my wife. Fresh lemonade was very good, i think i filled up on to much of that also. If you go, you can split a dish with someone."
Ron L.,"Covina, CA",4989,1343,5039,3.0,11/15/2008,"Wow...impressive from the outside.  Walked in..pretty cool.  Then when they sat us down, it looked just like a cafeteria.  Slide in to your seat,     Our food was alright...not that impressive and the service was just O.K. It's a nice looking place, but it would be nice if your group was seated with some kind of dividers so you don't hear the guy next to you."
Rod E.,"Redlands, CA",209,253,23,4.0,5/30/2011,"As far as chain restaurants go, this is one of my favs. Stopped by a few days ago for lunch. The fish tacos were tasty and the stuffed chicken tortillas were delicious! Too bad everything I like here is 100,000 calories or something like that. Oh well...more reason to take that spinning class I've been avoiding."
