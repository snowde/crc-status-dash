Lady-Lourdes D.,"Walnut, CA",180,87,128,4.0,1/4/2011,"Having their ahi tartare and warm crab & artichoke dip..soo good :) and of course, a few cheesecake slices to go! Yum!"
Abigail-Marie E.,"Fontana, CA",94,2,,4.0,11/9/2013,I love the location because it's close to my favorite stores. I seriously didn't like cheesecake until I tried a chocolate mousse and Kahlua cheesecake from here and I always have to get one for dessert or just pick one up and take it home.
Alex D.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",437,57,15,4.0,6/12/2011,One of the only franchise restaurants I would go to.  The servers are always on top of it and the food always comes out right.
R L.,"La Canada Flintridge, CA",2,8,1,1.0,8/31/2011,"Stupidest thing, they should change their ""Takes Reservations"" to NO! I called and they said that they take reservations when they first open for the first hour that they are opened and you must be seated within that hour.  HOW BUSY DOES CHEESECAKE FACTORY GET IN THE FRIGGIN MORNING COMPARED TO THE EVENING???"
Bugal K.,"San Marino, CA",119,276,10,4.0,5/28/2013,the only thing really good here are the chessecakes. the food is above average but its pretty good.
Ryan H.,"Alhambra, CA",4,58,,4.0,10/23/2011,"I really like this Cheesecake Factory location. I had a really good experience here. I came here for dinner with my family, and we all had a great time.  The food here, like any other Cheesecake Factory, was good. I ordered a chicken bellagio, and it was filled with flavor and definitely fresh. The chicken was very crunchy and juicy. as well as the ham. The sauce that went with the pasta was also really good. My mom ordered the petite fillet, and it was very tender. My uncle ordered the steak diane. The steak was cooked perfectly and very delicious. We ordered the usual vanilla bean cheesecake for dessert, and it was good.  The service was great. We ask the waiter for wheat bread, and he constantly gave us two loafs of wheat bread and no French baguette. I thought it was very generous and good service from him. We left him a good tip . The bill came out to be around $65. Pretty reasonable."
Ang H.,"Pasadena, CA",148,17,34,4.0,9/26/2011,"yummy sangria, soup and excellent chinese chicken salad. No springrolls at this perticular location. But still yummy!"
Jerome C.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",22,47,5,4.0,3/13/2011,They serve good food.  But I don't really go here unless there is an occasion with friends or family.  I don't like waiting too much.
Emily C.,Inland Empire,2,263,,5.0,2/11/2009,"I don't know how to make a deal with the Devil, but apparently somebody has done it, and it had something to do with this Cheesecake Factory.  My husband and I come here for dinners on the weekend despite the super long waits because every time the food is perfectly prepared.  It's nothing terribly original, but I tell you what, if you can cook 500 meals at the same time and get them all to taste this good, I'll eat my shoe.   We usually get something chicken-y, eat a ton of bread while we wait for it to come, drink raspberry lemonade, and then chow down when the food comes.   Also once I got an Irish Coffee, which was completely disgusting, but I managed to down it all and then we went over to Borders to read books for free!  But I didn't read.  I sat there with a stupid grin on my face, totally spaced out and buzzed, and listened to the BEST GUITAR PLAYER EVER.  Thank you, Cheesecake Factory."
John D.,"Phoenix, AZ",1,23,1,4.0,11/16/2013,My wife and I always eat here and have a good experience. The menu is very diverse and can satisfy anyone's palate. On a nice day/evening outside seating is always a nice option.
Isabel S.,"Fontana, CA",482,57,22,2.0,2/18/2009,"I'm not usually a frequenter of chain restaurants unless I'm with unlike minded people. They're ok, but usually the food just tastes industrial and frozen. Anyway, went out with a girlfriend last night, walking around VG, she chose Cheesecake Factory, and as I wasn't really craving anything in particular, we went.  Ambiance: Very dim, definitely made you feel cozy. It's oddly decorated with the feeling of being on some weird set. It seems like more goes into the interior design than the food.  Our Server: Was just ok, the only good thing was that he never ever let my green iced tea go empty, but he did take the cup instead of just walking around with a pitcher, that always creeps me out a bit.  Our Food: Heidi got the chicken and mushroom pizza. It was good, but the crust was crackery and lacked in any kind of flavor. It might as well have been flour and yeast... could've been WAY better. I, not being all that hungry, ordered a grilled cheese sandwich. It SUCKED! 7 for white toast, loaded in butter, with a thick slab of cheddar cheese between it... That's it... no Monterrey jack, no American, no Gouda, nothing... just cheddar cheese which wasn't even very good cheddar cheese. I was way disappointed... boo on their grilled cheese... The fries however, were bomb. And the green iced tea was super bomb! I couldn't/wouldn't stop drinking it! We didn't order cheesecake, but I have before and that always seems pretty good, except they use a weird whipped cream that tastes like it was whipped in a beer silo. Not a fan.  Anyway, that's that."
Jowel G.,"Covina, CA",151,377,987,3.0,12/2/2010,"We were invited out to dinner by some friends and this was one of the places we suggested that would be close to all of us and open late.  We dined on a Tuesday night and it was still pretty busy, but not busy enough to wait outside with a vibrator, you know that pager thing.  I do like the fact that we were able to park on the west side of the restaurant in the open lot without having to walk a mile or anything. We were seated immediately  which is a first for me after all this time of coming to a Cheesecake Factory. It had been a few months since I've been back to a CF and noticed that there were new items on the menu and some oldie but goodies.  I wanted to try something new, since I'm usually on the chicken and biscuits or the carbonara pasta kick each time.  I ordered off the specials menu and had the Chicken Bellagio with an iced mint green tea unsweetened.  The tea was tasty and had maybe 3 glasses?  I stayed away from the bread, and knew it would be good.  I just did not want to fill up on carbs when I'm having carbies for dinner.  The Chicken Bellagio was angel hair pasta with basil pesto cream sauce with 2 lightly breaded thin chicken breasts topped with arugula and prosciutto.  Now that prosciutto was like eating a pig, not bacon, but a pig.  You know that scent of a pig when you're at the petting zoo?  Just like that.  Our friend ate it.  It didn't bother him one bit. The dish was so creamy (and that had to be butter) was so rich.  I was only limiting myself to eating 1/2 of the dish.  It was just too much food.  With all that creamy sauce, there could have been more pasta.  Don't get me wrong it was tasty, but I think I prefer something less rich. Thank goodness for only eating 1/2 my dinner because I really wanted some ice cream.  And no, I'm not a freak for cheesecake anything.  I've never ordered cheescake at CF.  I would just take a taste from somone else's and i'm good.  My ultimate favorite, especially when it's strawberry season is the strawberry shortcake.  I love the sweet shortbread and the vanilla ice cream with a drizzle of chocolate (you have to ask for the chocolate syrup).  This has been my favorite, not sweet and not rich, but just right.  The other dessert ordered was the red velvet cheesecake cake.  Holy moly, what the hell?  That was really good.  It's 2 layers of cheescake and 2 layers of red velvet, combined and sliced like a piece of cake.  If you can order that-do it! I can forego food and just have dessert for the rest of my life.  I may write that previous line on other reviews because i mean it. The service was so so.  Our server was super nice and great with her suggestions, but she would disappear when we needed her and again it wasn't crazy busy like a Friday or Saturday night crowd.  The hubs has to be careful with his sugar intake beign that he's diabetic.  He was able to have the carb free or carb light cheescake.  It must have been edible, he almost finished the slice.  Besides that, he drinks only diet soda or water, so when he received his refills he asked the server to be sure that his drink was a diet coke and she answered ""absolutely, this is diet.""  Without tasting it, it was clear that it wasn't a diet coke because it smelled like root beer!  Now, unless the root beer was diet then no problem.  Attention to detail is very important, especially if you're asked point blank if something you ordered is really it. Overall, I would probably come back to try other new items on the men, but if I can avoid long waits to be seated, I probably will go somewhere else if I'm crazy starving."
Emily P.,"Placentia, CA",119,33,,2.0,7/29/2010,"Ate there this afternoon for lunch.  Had the Salmon.  When the server asked me what sides I wanted with it, I asked her to tell me what I could have.  She read them off and I picked Mash Potatoes and Mac and Cheese.  When we got the bill my meal was $3.00 more then I expected.  The server then informed me it was because of the mac and cheese charge, which she should have told me before I ordered it.  She offered to take it off, but it wasn't worth the time.  Just annoying.  Other then that, the food was ok."
Ryan W.,"Highland, CA",1,5,,1.0,1/18/2014,"Worst fucking restaurant I've ever been! First time I've ever gone and it was for my birthday. First, the server would rarely ever come to our table and when he did he did a drive by so we could never ask for anything...I literally had to walk to the bar to order two drinks! Finally and nice server came and took over for him because his shift was over but it didn't matter. We got our food and it was horrible!!!! Teriyaki chicken and rice- chicken was cold and rice was hard! Grande burrito- never said a thing about corn being in it! The manager took the burrito back to fix and came back the exact same fucking way!!!! Told then to just take it off my fucking bill between the service and the sucky ass food this place is horrible! Not to mention we had our 5 month old baby with us and the sling they gave us was completely unsafe ready to collapse and ever single one we asked for after that was the same! ...and they said no strollers please! That was THE worst experience ever! Even after the good came back and second time and was wrong the manager saw and never came back to us to fix the problem! This place needs to rot in hell!!!! And whoever cooks those meals and trains it's servers!!!!! Going to hit up cucas right now to get my damn burrito!"
Judy S.,"Los Angeles, CA",130,766,552,4.0,1/20/2013,"what a big difference this visit was from our last in Mission Viejo! we were here for a girls day outing last night... the wait was over an hour for a table but after 10 minutes we snagged a seat at the bar tables due to our diligence in watching them!  our server was Jordan, she was GREAT!  sweet & on the ball!  my chicken marsala was excellent & tropical martini wasn't half bad either... strong is good :) my girlfriends ordered the chipotle pasta something & fettucine & sun dried tomatoes something which they both liked but I thought mine was better ;) all in all it was a great night!  good servers make such a big difference in your dining experience!!  I hope management sees this & gives Jordan a bonus of some sorts!  she deserves it!"
grace j.,"Los Angeles, CA",30,173,,3.0,8/5/2008,"Your typical ""Cheesecake Factory"" in a sea of large companies, cookie-cut for every neighborhood east of Los Angeles, devouring every mom-and-pop shop in sight. *sigh* =( Alas, though, food is good and the service was acceptable.  If you're going to go here, might as well get something good: -Draft beer -Pomegrante mojitos -Avocado egg rolls -Chicken potstickers (surprisingly really good) -Ahi roll -Fried macaroni balls Have fun, nice view of the polluted mountains which are gorgeous as the sun sets; otherwise, can't breathe..."
L R.,"Fontana, CA",4,4,,4.0,10/18/2010,"Great food and good service! I have been coming to The Cheesecake Factory for about tens or more years now and have always had a good time.  On this occasion I came here with my gf on a date during the late afternoon in hopes of a good meal and good dessert.   I got the four cheese pasta (Amazing), which my favorite dish on the menu. I would recommend getting it if you like ricotta cheese.  My gf got the chicken bellagio,which has spaghetti noodles in a pesto sauce with grilled chicken on top.  Both dishes are good and are worth getting if your ever in the area.  The waiters were very polite and kept checking in with us to see if we were doing okay.  I also recommend the seasonal pumpkin cheesecake, which was amazing!!!   Overall I had goodtime and appreciated the ambience of the restaurant while spending time with my gf."
Dodie S.,"Costa Mesa, CA",459,88,13,5.0,7/27/2008,"So I had dinner here with my parents last night and had such a great time! We got there at around 7:30pm on a Saturday so naturally there was a wait. It only took about 15-20 minutes and we were seated by the window which was very nice.  Our waiter was absolutely perfect! He was attentive...never left us hanging...always got our drinks re-filled...very patient and just an all around nice guy! I think he was the only Asian waiter there that night.  I ordered the sweetened iced green tea with mint...yum! For dinner I had the Wasabi crusted ahi tuna with white rice and veggies with some kind of miso sauce and here's that I thought... The tuna was cooked to perfection, very tasty. The Wasabi crust on top was good but wold have loved it more if it was a little bit more crusty. White rice perfectly cooked. The Miso sauce underneath tasted like an Asian thousand island dressing so it kind of tricked my palate a little bit. But all in all it was good! The wheat bear that they serve you was yummy too. Sorry, but I didn't have room for cheesecake. My trainer would have kicked my ass.  Oh yeah... and they have happy hour from like 4pm to 6pm so fow shiz going back there for that!"
Doctor D.,"Apple Valley, CA",0,7,,3.0,7/27/2013,Great food! Service is sub par. Very slow service at the bar too and the bartender seems to do a lot of talking with their co workers. We don't want to hear about what you are going to do after work.
