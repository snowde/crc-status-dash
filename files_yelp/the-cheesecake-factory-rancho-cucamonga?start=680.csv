Brianna C.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,2,,1.0,5/22/2014,"Poor customer service. Didn't really have a big party. Only 8 people and the wait was an hour. Understandable, seeing as it was very busy. Waited for an hour and asked how much longer and the hostess said we were getting a table outside so it would be faster and it'd be 10 more minutes. That was fine we just wanted to get seated as soon as possible. The beeper goes off and our waiter leads us to our table outside but there were people already seated at our table. So the hostess comes over and tells us they got the parties mixed up. (Seriously?!) so we had to wait longer for them to fix up a new table. We got sat down and they took an hour to get our food out! It was ridiculous. Our waiter could have at least come by to let us know how long our food was going to take! The employees all look like they have know idea what they are doing. Like they've never dealt with big parties before. It was just a horrible experience. Horrid."
David R.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",1,17,4,4.0,5/8/2011,"Always a busy place. The Victoria Gardens is a great place to visit and try the restaurants, shop or just hang out. We frequent The Cheesecake Factory because of their selection and quality.  The food is always good and the service is great."
Emily V.,"Santa Clarita, CA",1,9,,1.0,9/14/2013,"Quite possibly the worst restaurant service I'd had in a while. The waitress was rude, and my order did not come out correctly. Our waitress disappeared half-way during our meal, and it took forever it to get our check. On top of it all, they add 20% gratuity for a party of 6, so our waitress earned $24 to basically do nothing. Regarding my order, another server came over and, speaking so condescendingly, asked what my order should have been. When I clarified, he insisted that I ordered something else. I again clarified what my order should have been, and we went around again. What a mess. As I type this, the table next to us is also complaining that their order was also not correct. Such a hassle that totally ruined my mon's birthday celebration. I doubt I will ever come back to any Cheesecake again."
Rachel Q.,"San Diego, CA",279,584,46,4.0,9/17/2008,"Yum.. yum.. yum.. yum..  I love Cheesecake Factory.  The food is excellent, I have yet to find a menu item that I do not like.  I have so far loved them all. Today, I had their Madeira Chicken and I LOVED it.   The servings are rather large for me, but I don't have a problem with it because I always box it up and get to eat it the next day.. so it's like two meals for the price of one and that makes me happy! I was a little disappointed because I went to order my guilt-free 6 Carb Cheesecake but they said that it was unavailable until late October.  I had to settle for their Banana Cream Cheesecake that that was very, very, very good. I have also had a many different flavors of their cheesecakes and I am not disappointed.  They are all good.  My one complaint is that it does get very crowded and busy on weekend nights.. so I try to avoid that place at all costs on weekend nights.."
BRANDY E.,"La Verne, CA",52,15,,2.0,6/7/2011,Quick note:  BAD service. Rude server. Poor food quality. Great Cheesecake. Will go back to try different cheesecakes...Will not order the food again.
Seth G.,"Albany, CA",116,127,,2.0,8/24/2008,"They offer an extensive menu, but mediocre food. I love the full page advertisements found in the menu. Not only can I order a salad, but I can also find a travel agent - who would have ever thought! :) The staff has been pretty good in the past and the interior is quite nice and comfortable. I would rate it a bit higher if the food was not so insipid. If they improved that, it would warrant 3 or 4 stars."
Sarah M.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,3,,4.0,10/18/2013,The food was acceptable and in very large proportions. I got the chicken and biscuits. It was mediocre and lacked seasoning and the gravy was rather bland.
Adrienne D.,"San Dimas, CA",0,21,,5.0,7/3/2012,"I was here for lunch on Sunday 7/1/12 with a date and the food was amazing as was the service.  My date had the Cobb salad and I had the crab cake sandwich.  The restaurant was extremely crowded when we arrived but we only had to wait about ten minutes before being seated.  Me and my sister and brother-in-law came in for an early dinner today 7/3/12 and once again the food and service were amazing.  Our server was Courtney and she was such a sweetie and very helpful.  We had the jerk chicken, chicken club sandwich, and the shrimp and bacon sandwich all were excellent.  Keep up the good work :) Ps....the snicker cheesecake is to die for."
M M.,"Riverside, CA",31,23,,5.0,2/24/2013,"Had to stop by for some cheesecake. It was awesome the ""Pina Colada Cheesecake"". Best ever....."
Pam A.,"Alta Loma, CA",4,69,2,5.0,12/15/2010,"A good server makes for a good evening, but a superb server pays attention to details and makes the evening sparkle.  Amy, our server tonight at The Cheesecake Factory, is just such a server.  We were a party of 15, and a surprise birthday party group at that, arriving at 7:00 on a busy evening.  From the moment we were seated,  the evening moved along at just the right pace.  Amy took our orders promptly when the birthday girl arrived, and she was right there with more bread, refills and special requests for the entire evening.   I wanted to try a Weight Management entree, so she guided me to the chicken which she described well, and it was the perfect choice.  I asked for some dressing on the side, and it was there immediately.  I've never had a waitperson do this kind of a job, and now I see what a difference it makes.   The food was amazing--it came out quickly, and we all marveled at our plates.  Cheesecake Factory really has the visual elements nailed.  If I hadn't read the nutrition information, I would have begged the man across the table for a few pieces of his Orange Chicken!  Water, bread and drinks were filled without having to ask, and the birthday slice of cheesecake was presented with appropriate pomp and circumstance by Amy and her fellow staff members, bringing the evening to a grand conclusion.   Thank you, Amy--I will be back and you are awesome!"
Alicia M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,4,,4.0,7/24/2013,"My husband and I had dinner here last night, we were seated within 30 mins., which was nice since it looked to be pretty packed inside. The service and the food was good a bit pricey compared to other local chain restaurants, over all it was a good experience."
Floyd I.,"Fontana, CA",2,14,,2.0,5/5/2007,"I really don't know what to make of this place... Great ambiance... Mediocre dish...  I used to love their southwestern roll or something... been eating the same thing since I was 22 when I went with a friend in L.A.  Then last winter, I ordered the same thing... wham three hours later... I lost all my strength... I was sick like a dog... I was literally in fetal position.... Bottom line is if this was just a coffee shop with cheesecake it would be a FIVE STAR...  Try the Godiva Cheesecake its superb..."
S G.,"Fontana, CA",0,38,15,1.0,9/26/2014,"So first off let me just say this was my first time ever going to The Cheesecake Factory and this specific location. The service was extremely slow and when we got to our table they sat us in a corner which was extremely dirty. The menu was sitting on top of my napkin and plate which was completely disgusting because MANY people handle the same menu with their bare hands. My utensils were also on the bare table which I'm hoping was cleaned properly. The worse part about this whole trip though was the fact that my sister found a fly in her Green Iced Tea. We told the waitress we wanted another one and she did just that, but when the check came, instead of removing the drink, she charged us for it. I've never been so disappointed in a restaurant. For a chain that is modernly upscale and high priced, I would expect so much more. I will never go back to this specific location again. I really wish I would have taken a photo of the fly in our drink for proof, but you've all been warned. If the manager is reading this, you should be very disappointed in your servers and your sanitary skills (or lack thereof I should say)."
Rae T.,"Moreno Valley, CA",271,352,708,1.0,6/30/2012,"Came here for a friend's graduation party and was not impressed. The server already knew she was going to get the automatic 18% gratuity tacked onto our bill so there wasn't anything she really had to work for. I think since this restaurant chain is such a fashion statement, they remain a watering hole for many crowds. The food portions may be large but quality, taste and quantity are highly inconsistent. They do not accept reservations so forget holding a large gathering here, you could get stuck waiting a long while. If you come in a large crowd, do not expect decent service, but do expect to fork over an often undeserved tip. There should be a law against that so customers are not forced into tipping for bad service. I attended another graduation party at a hole in the wall restaurant the next day and was much more impressed. Plus the restaurant refrigerated the cake I brought the guest of honor until it was dessert time. This place sat us outside, did not care about the cake melting, and did not bring out proper serving utensils. I guess we were to be thankful that they even let us cut the cake there I guess. I have heard many others complain about other locations as well and the general arrogance of the employees and management. I guess this chain will not care until they start seeing a drop in return customers. I have yet to see what the hype is all about."
Christine a.,"Fontana, CA",1,2,,4.0,12/10/2011,"This is one of my favorite resturaunts. Today I ordered the wild mushroom burger with fries. The food was great. This was the second time I have ordered this dish and I was not disappointed. However, since it was a Friday the place was pretty busy so service was a bit slow. The waitress took a while to give us our drinks, but the food was good."
jennifer R.,"Menifee, CA",40,7,,1.0,2/22/2010,"So on the 19th my husband, my three friends, and I went to the Cheesecake Factory. When we arrived they were pretty busy being a Friday night; however we were told that we could sit outside while we waited for our table to be ready, which was suppose to be 35 minutes. So we sat outside waiting while we each had some bread and one drink. After a while we were wondering why it was taking so long to get to our table inside (where is was warm). We looked at the time and it had been 45 minutes so we figured we would wait a little longer.  After we still didn't get paged for our table inside we went to check how much longer it would be. They told my husband probably another 15-25 minutes... well by this time we just decided to stay outside because a table opened up with a heater above it and we thought well at least we can order our food so we don't have to wait for the table inside and wait for the food to come out to us. At this time the waiter happily helped us to the new table. It was cold but we still thought it was okay and we were having fun talking.  So then it starts sprinkling and the waiter asked us if we wanted umbrellas, well of course we took the umbrellas cause it was either that or get wet. Our food and drinks shortly later came out and we all had to eat so fast because the rain started coming down hard and we wanted to get out of the rain... never were we offered to come inside the restaurant. So we were talking about it and figured we wanted to talk to the manager and tell her our situation. My husband was thinking maybe she would at least comp. one of our drinks ($7-10). When the manager came out we were all huddled under the work area trying to stay warm and dry because at this point the umbrellas were dripping or should I say pouring onto the table.  Anyway she finally came out and my husband told her, ""well I don't want to state the obvious looking at the soaked table"", she said ""well what is the obvious?"" and may I add with an attitude. So then when my husband was telling her the story all she did was nod her head agreeably and said yahuh over and over again. She then said I know you guys were offered to come inside. (when we were not). She was arguing with us over the fact that we were not asked to come inside. She then said well you choose to sit outside. Well no we didn't we wanted to sit inside and were were told a shorter time period and finally decided to sit outside so we could order food and not wait another hour to eat. We also didn't ask to get rained on. She didn't really care and just kept acting as if she was agreeing. She wasn't doing anything to help the situation not even apologizing for the situation.  I charmed in to tell her that she wasn't listening to what he was saying she finally with an attitude said well let me look at your bills. She went inside and we followed into the cook's area to stay dry.  Our waiter came up to us and handed us our bills back with a comp. meal for each bill (3). Well that is nice, but hello where did the unprofessional rude manager, who has no customer service, go. She never came back to tell us sorry never came back to say anything. We paid the bills and gave a tip anyway cause the waiter was good. They said we could get corporate phone numbers up front, cause I was unhappy with the manager.  On our way out we went up to the front desk and asked for the phone number information and names. The manager was standing up front when I saw her I said, ""just so you know we were never offered to come inside"". Again she just nodded her head saying yahuh. I said  it is unprofessional the way you handed the situation and all you had to do is apologize for the situation. She said with a smirk and attitude ""you want me to apologize?"", as she giggled. I said well yeah that would be nice. She didn't do anything at all I told her well I am sure corporate would love to hear how unprofessional their managers are and left.  Currently I have left a message with corporate and I am waiting for a phone call back."
ChRiSTiNa C.,"Colton, CA",21,205,867,4.0,6/1/2010,"The food is great, and so are the menu options. There is something for everyone. I have tried a lot of items such as burgers, pastas, appetizers, salads and so much more. Everything has always been delish. The cheesecakes are also yummy. This location can get really crowded and chaotic. I think they need to be more organized."
A B.,"Los Angeles, CA",221,351,,3.0,7/16/2009,"I have found the food and service at this Cheesecake Factory to be consistent with other Cheesecake Factory restaurants. Personally, my three favorite entrées are the Grilled Pork Chops, Beef Ribs, and Miso Salmon. Buffalo Blasts are my favorite of the appetizers. Service is generally friendly and prompt."
Crystal L.,"Huntington Beach, CA",116,183,31,5.0,2/24/2012,"i LOVE LOVE LOVE cheesecake factory... it's probably my number one favorite restaurant of all time. they pretty much have a little bit of every culture on their menu. so whatever you feel like having they have it... the service is always wonderful. i don't think i've ever had bad service there. :) my favorite dish there is probably the miso salmon. i know i should get something else so i don't get sick of it, but it's sooo good! it's on the pricier side, but soo worth it.  sometimes the wait can be horrible, but for the most part of the time it's not that bad. i also really like how they now have a separate menu called ""skinnilicious"" pretty much it's a menu with their dishes that they have on a regular menu, but a lighter version. not every single item is on that skinnilicious menu, but they have a decent amount of entree's on it. i tried the asian chicken salad tacos from that menu and it was really good."
Bruce B.,"Ontario, CA",0,2,,4.0,12/31/2012,"Great staff, awesome food selection, and some BOMB cheesecake. What is not to like."
