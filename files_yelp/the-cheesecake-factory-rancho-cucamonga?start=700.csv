Laura S.,"Glendora, CA",0,2,,2.0,6/29/2014,"My friend and I wanted to grab a quick bite to eat. We asked to sit outside, which was great until we noticed a party of 10 girls celebrating a birthday. Our waitress attended to us rather quickly and took our drink orders. When she brought us our drinks and bread we were ready to order but was not asked. The waitress was more consumed with clearing off the birthday parties table than checking up on us. After about 15 mins of her running around in circles around us, I finally got up and had to go to the front desk and ask if anyone who wasn't busy, to take our order. We finally ordered and our food came and it was delicious! As we get the bill, I tell our waitress to apply the giftcard first and then split our cards down the middle for the bill. When we got our checks, my friends bill was 10 dollars more than mine. She had used the giftcard on my check and then did the math wrong when she split the bill. It was very frustrating because I know it was very simple service from us but it felt so exhausting being a part of that awful experience."
Jen C.,"San Dimas, CA",0,22,,4.0,12/8/2010,The breakfast and the sandwiches are always good here. The portions are pretty big and it's hard to squeeze in a cheesecake afterwards but I still order a slice.
Diana P.,"Orange County, CA",271,84,24,2.0,1/18/2012,"So first off if this review was about the food I'd be giving it at 5. But this review is simply about The service here at this location is just plain and simply stupid! Something needs to be done by management ASAP! The last few times we have been here we get sat pretty fast but then  wait and wait for a while before someone comes and brings us water or acknowledges us!!! We sit there wondering who the f is our waiter??  I also find it very annoying that our waiter/waitress gets switched on us like 2-3 times! I understand people have to take breaks but seriously the last time we were there we literally had no idea who the hell our waiter was bc we had someone come up to our table and introduced themselves 3 times!!!! lol.... To the cheesecake mgt get ur heads out of ur asses and get ur staff on point! Great food but terrible experience which unfortunately for your business I have to give u a poor rating for bad service!! Almost forgot to mention when our first waitress came by and finally took our order after like 10 mins of waiting. I was actually reading reviews about this place on yelp. After taking our order she quickly came back and asked, ""were u waiting for a long time?"" I said yes. I'm sure she saw the yelp page open on my phone lol..."
Anon r.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,21,,2.0,3/5/2012,Rude waiter. Took my plate away to box it even as the rest of family was atill eating. Spicy cashew chicken was sweet and not spicy at all
Nalini M.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,9,,3.0,4/9/2010,"I'm giving this place 3 stars solely for the food, it never disappoints.  I had the Jamaican Spiced Chicken/Rice - delicious...and the crowd I was w/ seemed to like their dishes as well. Here's where it got ugly, we went there to celebrate a birthday, and there was about 12 of us.  When it came time to pay the bill, everyone pitched in and we sent it off w/ the server.  She came back to our table 5 minutes later w/ the manager (I'm assuming he was a manager there, but can't recall his name).  The manager announced we were $43 short.  So we instantly started pulling more $$ out of our pockets, which took a few minutes...well anyway, we turned in more cash.  The manager said....you're still $12 short...so we pitched in the rest....manager said $0.56 short.  WOW! Keep in mind this was on the patio in front of other patrons.  So yes, we were slightly embarrassed, esp the birthday girl.  Really - .56 cents on a +$200 bill??!!!  Please homie.... It's sad, but some of us won't return there solely b/c of the Manager's way of handling the situation - not friendly at all, not patient at all, LOUD and obnoxious.   Great job Rancho Cheesecake!!"
Jennifer S.,"Monrovia, CA",11,14,4,1.0,3/23/2009,"Avoid this Cheescake Factory!!!!  Me and my friends stopped in to this Cheesecake Factory to grab some lunch before a movie on Saturday 3/21/09.  I ordered a Club Sandwich.  When the sandwich came, I noticed a small hair on it.  I asked the server to take it back and get me a new sandwhich.  The second sandwich came with the blackest avacado you have ever seen and ANOTHER hair.  The manager came out and apologized.  After about 20 minutes he finally returned with another sandwich at which point I was so livid I told him I did not want it.  After all that they actually tried to give us a bill.  Needless to say we told them we werent going to pay it.  AVOID this location!!!!!!"
Lindsey B.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",16,208,55,4.0,1/26/2009,"I'm a fan of the cheesecake only!  The food is no bueno!  My fiance and I like to hop in here after walking around all day, sit in the bar section (no wait that way) and order a piece of cheesecake.  I highly recommend any of the cheesecakes with raspberries in it... my favorite!  The bread is pretty good too... but not the entrees."
Mrs. H.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,16,,2.0,4/25/2011,"This place is like the nail shop of restaurants. They get you in and get you out. More than once I have had to gently insist (while seething) that the staff clean the food from under the table prior to seating us. Interestingly the staff seemed a little hostile and resistant to providing customers with seating sans the last customer's food droppings. So. . . a little dirty. Decor is interesting but got old fast. The food is just ""whatever"" I like the cheesecake mostly. Someone please deprogram the wait staff from interrupting conversations to ask ""How's everything tasting?"" when you clearly have not even picked up your fork AND coming back to the table every 10 minutes to ask again, ""How's everything?"" in that chirpy phony ""ready - okay"" high school cheerleader voice. You'll get your tip, leave me alone, I'll call you if I need you, let me enjoy conversation with my meal mate, and the meal itself."
Jen T.,"Los Angeles, CA",313,770,58,1.0,4/27/2009,We went here a few weeks ago and I've already had bad experiences with this Cheesecake factory. I'm not sure what's up with them and their service but we all went and my gf ordered a vegetarian pasta and found an uncooked piece of bacon in her pasta... GROSS! Anyways... they didn't do much for us besides apologize... their service sucks and they were not even busy. Boo... don't go here. There are better and other places to eat at victoria gardens.
GM M.,"Studio City, Los Angeles, CA",0,11,2,2.0,3/14/2012,"I've been to other Cheesecake factory restaurants before and never had this problem until the Rancho Cucamonga one. Went there the other day with my fiance. The waiting area was crowded but we only waited for 10 minutes which was decent. When we sat down at our table, The table was still dirty from the last patrons. It had bread crumbs and other filth on it. The WORST of it is that they put the flatware on the table which was dirty. No napkins wrapping and protecting the flatware or even placing the flatware on top of the napkins, no, just the flatware straight on the dirty table. So gross. The waiter was aweful also. We waited at our table for quite some time before he even came over to get our drink orders. He was awefull. I give this place a whopping 2 stars 1 for the original wait time for a crowded place and 1 for the food. I wouldn't recommend this place to my friends. There's nothing worse than a dirty restaurant."
Hannah B.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",12,50,72,5.0,3/23/2011,the best place ever my favorite restaurant very good service the best food ! they give you alot of food for a good price ! i love u cheesecake factory !
Mark T.,"Upland, CA",7,86,7,5.0,1/3/2014,"good service, wait wasnt long and lunch specials are priced really good with decent portions"
Jeremiah B.,"Apple Valley, CA",261,13,1,1.0,7/20/2011,"As Vince W mentioned my family had to deal with the worst manager I have ever had to deal with. This was by far the worst customer service I have ever experienced. My mother ordered a cheesecake with a whipped topping. The waitress told us the topping was the last of what they had and they were making a new batch. A few of us at the table try some of the topping and it was sour and tasted AWFUL. The courteous waitress gets the manager because she wants to remove this item from the bill. The manager comes over and says,""I tried the topping and is fine  but I am willing to take it off the bill."" We think alright maybe he had the new batch since this one had none left. The manager says,  ""we had the same thing but I will take it off the bill"". We are all shocked  as the manager removes the item off the bill . The waitress comes back and offers to comp all of the desserts. The same manager comes back with  the bill and says, ""I understand you have an issue with the bill?"" My mother says, ""no"" and he makes outrageous comments about her talking about him behind his back. The than angered manager stands over our table as my mom signs the check for the $85 dollar bill. My mother may eat at this place again but I refuse to give any business to a company that employs people with little respect for others. As I write this I am still in shock by this managers comments and this may always be this experience I remember when I hear the ""Cheese Cake Factory""."
Nick D.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,29,,5.0,11/28/2011,You pretty much can't go wrong with any of the chicken dishes. The club sammich is amazing. And to start the Tex Mex egg rolls are a must.
Rosemary M.,"Rialto, CA",0,16,4,4.0,6/18/2009,"My family and I had dinner here at 8pm on Wed. and aside from getting our appetizer a minute before our meal (she admitted to forgetting about it) we really enjoyed ourselves. Their Rasberry Martinis are delicious, as was the rest of our meal. The Cipotle pasta, Louisiana chicken, the kids pizza were all generous portions (each was at least 3 servings) and tasty. The meal was pricey, but they have to pay for all that fancy decor and ambiance somehow.  The restaurant was busy, but we didn't feel neglected-despite the forgotten appetizer. I have been here several times and really enjoyed the experience. their cheesecake selection is amazing. Then again, we weren't starving, we are lite eaters, and understand that mistakes can happen anywhere."
charlotte s.,"Stavanger, Norway",92,1233,31,4.0,9/4/2007,"i gave this cheesecake factory 4 stars because we were seated immediately which is pretty rare for any given cheesecake factory... the service was friendly and our food was fresh and tasty.  we had some spinach and cheese dip to start, then for my main course i had the bang bang chicken and shrimp, my friend had the chicken madeira and my husband had the fish and chips... all huge portions of course..."
M M.,"San Dimas, CA",0,21,3,2.0,6/22/2013,"Went to lunch with both my sisters to celebrate two of our June birthdays (they are a week apart).  We always go to this Cheese Cake Factory, because the food is good and the White Coconut Chocolate cheese cake is delicious.  We ordered one piece of cheese cake to share, but it seemed very small.  It was only about 1 & 1/2 inches at the widest part.  We waited for the waiter to come back, but he was too busy with other customers.  We foolishly went ahead and started eating it without waiting, but did leave about a half dollar size piece.  We asked the waiter about it, and he had the manager, Susan, come to our table to speak to us.  She stated that the cakes come already sliced from the bakery and they were all the same size pieces.  We didn't doubt her, but she acted as if we were lying.  She didn't actually say we were lying, but her attitude was very clear that she didn't believe us, that we were lying.  We were insulted and embarrassed, and just told her to forget it and put it on the bill.  We actually felt the $8 for such a tiny piece was ridiculous.  I never expect something for nothing and can afford to pay for anything I want; I just don't appreciate being insulted.  That manager needs further training in customer service.  I believe she realized she hadn't been diplomatic and did take the charge off the bill, but it didn't make us feel any better.  On the way out we stopped at the cheese cake counter and could see the slices of the cheese cakes were definitely wider.   My sister called the restaurant back to speak to the general manager and the person answering the phone said that sometime there are smaller pieces, but they just give those away; they don't sell them.  Interesting..."
Rene B.,"La Verne, CA",22,272,13,1.0,7/20/2007,"This has got to be the worst cheesecake factory I have been too.  I went in during the afternoon to avoid the crowd, and we still waited for a table.  When we sat down, there were flies all over, the server apologized and explained they were throught the restaurant.  Then, I noticed the booth was covered in crumbs from the previous patrons bread, and it was also all over the floor.  The funny thing was, my wife accidnetly kicked a piece from under the table into the aisle, and a chubby manager walked by and kicked it, but didnt bother to bend over and pick it up!  If it wasnt for the cheesecake, it wouldnt be popular."
Mary P.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,35,,5.0,9/4/2009,Lemoncello Cream Torte cake thingy is amazingly good!
J R.,"Claremont, CA",0,43,,1.0,8/9/2008,"I used to like eating at Cheesecake, but my experience at this one was so bad I refuse to go to another cheesecake ever again. I went for lunch and ordered the salmon. This is the dish I usually get and it comes with a cream sauce. Well, this time it wasn't sauce it was like a soup. My salmon was swimming in this cream soup that just made it inedible. My potatoes and asparagus were also drowning. There were so many flies inside I had to keep swatting them away from my food. Worst of all I was brought out the dinner portion even though it was like 2 p.m. and I specifically said lunch portion and was charged the dinner price (which is almost a $10 difference). I pointed this out to the waitress and she didn't even bother to make the correction. It was a mess."
