Gene S.,"San Bernardino, CA",0,12,,1.0,4/11/2009,"The dining experience I had at this Cheesecake Factory on 4/4/09 was undoubtedly the worst dining experience I have ever had.  I ordered their lunchsize portion of meatloaf (touted to be one of their specialties).  If you don't know what the seasoning thyme tastes like you'll find out when you eat there.  They use it in the meatloaf, shepard's pie, and other dishes.  It is so overwhelming, along with the other spices, it literally makes you gag.  They must order it by the pallet.  Somebody needs to tell the cooks (not chefs) that seasonings are to enhance the flavor of food, they are not suppose to be the flavor. The corn succotash was absolutely horrible.  It was so bitter I had to spit it out.  Needless-to-say I did not eat any of the food.  My wife ordered the lunchsize fish and chips.  This was th exact opposite.  The batter used was tasteless and the coleslaw tasted like shredded cabbage with milk poured over it.  It had absolutely no flavor.  My daughter ordered the lunchsize shepard's pie.  Well, you can imagine what that tasted like.  Can you say ""thyme?""  We didn't have any of their cheesecake but I certainly hope it's awesome because their entrees suck!!  I won't be back (and I mean to any of their restaurants)"
