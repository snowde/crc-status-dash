Gladys M.,"Banning, CA",23,27,60,4.0,5/19/2017,"I love this restaurant, I'm a pasta junkie. It's so delicious. Love stopping by for lunch after spending the day shopping and walking around Victoria Gardens. The service is okay, depending on when you come. The food portions are amazing, you get a lot of food. You get what you pay for."
therese m.,"Irvine, CA",196,69,13,5.0,4/27/2017,"I love coming here for early lunches during the week and sitting at the bar. Alesha is a really good bartender. She's attentive and fast. Though I love The Cheesecake Factory, I can say she's possibly too good for this restaurant. The location is also ideal. It's right off the freeway in the middle of the mall."
Liz S.,"Upland, CA",131,17,44,5.0,7/3/2017,"Alex was our waitress and she was phenomenal! It was busy (lunch time) and she was running all over the restaurant  trying to take care of all of her tables. Totally awesome service, top notch! She did not miss a beat!

Candice C.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,7,3,1.0,7/1/2017,"My husband and I have ordered food and cheesecake many nights after a busy work week from Cheesecake Factory however last night we received the worst customer service over the phone attempting to place a pick up order. The first call I placed I was left on hold for five minutes waiting for someone to answer after I was transferred to the bakery to place order. So I hung up and called back. I told the lady what happened and she said she will transfer me again and that the bakery had to take the order. Again I was left on hold for five minutes and no one picked up. So I hung up again and called back. This time I asked to speak to a manager. The manager was by far the worst, he was rude , never apologized, and cut me off and rudely said ""I'll take your order"". I placed my order but I was so upset about how I was treated I never picked it up because why give my money to place that doesn't care about customer service. My husband and I decided to go somewhere else. This will no longer be my go to spot."
Asaad F.,"Chino Hills, CA",0,3,,2.0,11/29/2017,"I like cheesecake factory restaurants, but this place always has some problems. If it's not issues with them getting the orders wrong then it's issues with getting seated on a slow night or never getting your order at all because they lost your ticket. I wish they'd get it right. I've brought it to their attention before, but no change yet."
Bill H.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",88,16,6,4.0,6/25/2017,"Giving it five stars ,,, well not quite.  To begin the evening wife and I had to wait 30 minutes but, for dining at 7:30 on a Saturday night it just speaks to how popular it is.  Wife and I ate lunch there and there was no waiting, I'm retired. Service provided by DAVID S. Was spectacular.  He had five tables ranging from a table for two to a table for eight.  It seemed like he ran all the time. The food was great.  Wife had chicken colleta, I had shrimp and chicken gumbo.  Portions were huge and, the taste was wonderful. There were different people who delivered food and different people who cleaned up tables.  The operation ran smoothly like a Swiss clock. I am bill hanlon of Rancho Cucamonga."
Monica S.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",33,25,3,1.0,8/13/2017,"The to go wait is ridiculous! It was as if we were waiting to eat sit down. Customer service at to go counter is deplorable, no greeting, no smile, they didn't say they would be right with us, nothing. Manager Derek looks frazzled and gives unrealistic times as to when my ONE (1) slice of cheesecake would be ready. Horrible experience! Total time from entrance to exit of the restaurant was 43 minutes...for one slice of cheesecake! Never again!"
Andrea K.,"Victorville, CA",1,20,,2.0,3/5/2017,"Here the reason to my two stars ..  We drive 30 miles for this spot. Simply because our town does not have a factory. The wait is usually pretty long. We waited about 40 min for two, it was a Friday. So we waited patiently. Not a problem. After 40 min , we got sitted, the waiter asked for our drinks, which took a while. Not even water was brought to our table or the pre- bread to stuff you up before the main course. 10 min. Later we saw another waitress and asked for our wine and beer.  We ended getting one water and our official drinks. We order the four cheese pasta to be shared between my SO and myself. I have gotten this meal before & this time around it didn't taste the same. Watered down, undercooked pasta and no taste to it. The service was bad. It was like we were put in a small corner & forgotten. Yes, I understand group customers are likely to be more important , but give us the same service as those who have a bullet bill because two people  can always leave a bigger tip. However, that's not the point.  The point is service should be the same , with respect. We didn't leave no tip. Because we had three or four different waiters. And their was no service and no questions being asked every three min. I'm sure I'll go somewhere else."

Jonny L.,"Mammoth Lakes, CA",27,90,114,4.0,10/5/2016,"Open and airy, usually bustling with patrons, appropriately staffed and famous cheesecake to finish off a meal, the Cheesecake Factory is well rounded. This particular location does the brand good. Two of their go to items are the Chicken Madeira and the Shrimp Bistro Pasta. Both are around $18. The chicken dish is wonderful, topped with a good sauce, cheese and Asparagus and served with mashed potatoes. The Shrimp dish is loaded with garlic, and is in a creamy, lemony sauce, served over perfectly cooked pasta. The bread basket is good with fresh whole wheat and sourdough loaves. The drink menu has a large selection of different choices. Closed the latest meal here with Raspberry Lemon and Classic Cheesecake. Scary good if you have a sweet tooth. At this writing went to this location for lunch. Service was attentive. Plenty of parking nearby. From pulling into park and driving away took 45 min and the meal at no time felt rushed. Not bad. My share of the bill was less than $30 bucks with tip. Ordered off of the dinner menu and it appeared there were many other lunch menu choices properly priced."
Molly E.,"Upland, CA",4,20,,1.0,7/14/2017,"Okay. Long horrible story, but I will try to make it short. (It has taken me a while to write this and originally I had a dissertation below). But in a nutshell, I took my son to Cheesecake Factory in ""Victoria Gardens."" And it was a shit show. Literally lost my appetite, but stayed for my little guy because he was hungry and had waited long enough..... 1. The check in. They told me 25 to 30 min for a table. I was in front of the place at the 20 min mark and no buzzer was going off, but I took my son to the car to grab something... We walk back @ the 27 min mark and I was told they were buzzing me for 10 min and we lost our inside table and would have to be outside. That was a lie with the time. I even checked my phone from when the buzzer went off at my car. Nope... Needless to say, my son was excited to eat outdoors. So, I said fine.  2. We are seated. When the host is walking us to our seats (he was nice), I say to my son, ""We should have gone to the restroom before we were seated."" (I didn't realize how far the walk was going to be back through the crowd until we got to our table). We get water and PLACE OUR ORDER with our server. My son is super excited to order even more than what I initially ordered. I am thinking about washing our hands before we eat because we just went to the closed kid park where my son stuck his hands in the lack luster fountain/birdbath... I deleted 3 and 4... It involved the bugs outside. 5. There were quite a few bugs flying around so, my son and I go to the restroom to wash our hands. When we get to the restroom we both us it at the same time (different stalls). We wash our hands CORRECTLY, dry them, and head back to our table (all of 4 mins). When we get to the patio, my son says, ""They stole our table!"" And he says it really loud. I walk him back inside and a waiter says, ""Maybe you were at the other patio,"" and points us in a direction that confused me from where I had walked from. I go there anyway and it is totally not the right place and my son is saying ""NOOOOOOOOOO, they stole our seats""....... The whole time.  6. Seats taken. When I take a step into the dark covered patio, I walk out and have a chance to talk to my son again and explain to him that he is right. (I already knew he was right because I remember the ladies sitting between the boor and our table. They were dressed fully covered.) So, we walk back and I explain to a waitress that people are now sitting at our seat. She said she would find our waitress.  7. Seats taken 2. I see the waitress that claimed she was going to tell my waitress like 3 more times while I am waiting with my son at the door of the patio. He is hungry and frustrated and definitely feels cheated at this point and is asking a million questions about how people are allowed to steal seats from people. And asking why. ? ""Why are they allowed to take our seats? We had to wait for these seats outside because we were late for our inside seats. So why can they just take our seats? Why don't they tell them to move?"" 8. At this point several people in the bar area as well as where are seats were are just staring at us standing in the area by the door. A waiter ask me to move. I move, but then I just out loud where am I supposed to stand when our table now has people sitting at it. Two waitresses ask me about it (because my waitress never came over to deal with it). I explain to them what is going on and they go to find my waitress. 9. A man in a grey shirt comes back, does not introduce himself, and starts explaining how he has a table inside for us. And that there was a mix up. At this point I am so pissed with the shitty ass service, his lack luster approach to customer service, and I feel like really speaking my mind, but I hold it all in and now feel on the verge of crying.... This was literally the most embarrassing dining experience I have ever had. The whole freaking restaurant has been looking at me standing out of place for over 5 minutes (probably close to 10 mins like the hostess claimed they were buzzing us for) and you now have a table inside in the back of the restaurant.  10. I am going to wrap this up because it only gets worse. My server comes back saying a bus boy gave away our table because they just saw drinks there. Ducking liar. As a waitress you would have been checking on our table so you should have stopped anyone from moving our drinks. They bring bread.... And two seconds later some other girl comes around with a bread basket enough for ten people. I am like we just got bread. She gave me some creepy smile and then said, ""I was told to bring more."" WTF. Like bread gets rid of embarrassment. Bread gets rid of discrimination. I couldn't even eat. I was so disgusted and I had to wait 10-15 min for utensils. The manager had the audacity to come back and say, ""I am going to take care of you don't worry. Dessert is on me."" GTFOH with your dessert. I tried calling them, but no manager avail. I just plan to call corporate."
Rhi M.,"Moreno Valley, CA",4,43,80,4.0,1/29/2017,"We went on a Saturday night so we expected it to be packed! We had a party of nine. I put my name on the list and the man at the front told me it would be a hour and 45 minutes. No biggie. I didn't realize though he didn't give me a buzzer so I went back to the front. This time I talked to a girl and she said I didn't need a buzzer since they have my phone number, I told her no one took my number. So she of course took it. We waited about a hour and 20 minutes.  They sat us on the heated patio, it was cold but the heat stands really made a difference. Our server Sunny got to us quick. He was very efficient! We got our bread and drinks fast and he was patient with the two jokers at our table! Food was AMAZING. I had the farfalle chicken pasta and my husband got the fried catfish.  Both were hot and cooked perfectly. Everyone else was happy with their sandwiches and burgers. We had fun with Sunny as our server and a good time sharing food and laughs!"
Eduardo P.,"Victorville, CA",0,2,2,1.0,6/9/2017,Not happy and very hungry and still waiting for some sort of service at our table .. well we got bread and soda so I think me and the wife will live
Ulises S.,"Riverside, CA",0,7,,5.0,9/25/2017,Cheese cake factory is a great place to eat because it has many different options when it comes to food! They have a big menu and a lot of good alcoholic drink options. A little more classy than other places like chilis and applebees. Plus they have delicious cheese cakes for desert. TRUTH.
Don S.,"Los Angeles, CA",186,3,1,1.0,5/14/2017,This place was ridiculous yesterday! My lemon herb chicken looked like dried out pig feet. The chicken littles were cold and burnt so we sent them back and all they did was drop them back in the hot grease and brought them back. It was ready bad! My worst experience at a Cheesecake by far.
Jim W.,"Ontario, CA",0,47,,2.0,9/13/2017,"Have made many trips here and food has always been good, but today we had to wait forever for our food.  Got in at 11:00, ordered food at about 11:05, I ordered Salmon and my Son ordered a pasta dish. Mine came in about 40 minutes, my Sons's came at 11:55, we just had them box up his food, took mine to go and left. Never ever waited so long for food.  It seemed like people in our same area were having the same poroblem.  Probably won't go back."
Beth D.,"San Diego, CA",0,11,1,3.0,7/23/2017,"The service was good, but unfortunately the food was not. We got the eggplant parm, which was supposed to be covered in cheese and marinara. It was sparsely dotted with toppings. We also got the 4 cheese pasta and added chicken for an extra $4. There was hardly any chicken on it and the Penne pasta was too al dente. It was hugely disappointing considering it's a pretty expensive restaurant."
Pamela V.,"Santa Monica, CA",185,66,12,1.0,6/23/2017,"I refuse to go to this Cheesecake Factory. After coming here 3 times (because it is the most local one), every time the service has been sub-par. The last straw for me was when we had visitors coming from out of town with certain dietary restrictions and we were treated poorly by the staff and management. Food is good (which kept us coming back even with subpar service), but you can get that kind of food quality at many other places. Needless to say, we will not be returning."
Ashley D.,"Colton, CA",89,24,29,4.0,3/25/2017,"Had lunch here last week. I was just craving the Snickers Bar Cheesecake. Would come here all the time just for it. It's light and creamy. I love it. For lunch I tried the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp was flavorful, it says it's spicy but it was not at all to me. But still good!"
Dan Bi W.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,90,4,1.0,12/21/2016,"This is a racist establishment. Count your blessings, guy with the red bow tie who automatically assumed I didn't speak English. Don't live your life like that man. We also asked the waitress Casey if we could switch seats before our food came out. She wasn't our waitress, but our waiter was not coming any time soon. She rolled her eyes and said, ""I guess."" Thanks for that. We were just trying to get a seat by the heater considering we were still freezing even with out winter coats on. It's fine if you say no, but don't roll your eyes at me, bitch! The waiter was nice though. I didn't complain about anything because he was so nice to us despite how busy this place was.  Regardless, I will never be coming here again."
