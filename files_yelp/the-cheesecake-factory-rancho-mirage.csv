Mike R.,"Oshawa, Canada",6,49,,4.0,1/3/2018,"Great chain restaurant, menu is so large it is insane. But a good place with lots of variety. Portions are huge, so share!  Have to try the cheese cake, all too good to make a recommendation"
nick r.,"Rancho Mirage, CA",62,38,28,2.0,1/6/2018,"Went in for my birthday this week and sat in the bar.  We wanted something easy and we enjoy sitting there, especially when the restaurant is busy.  Service was ok.  The bartenders were working at cleaning up the bar which is normal, but after our drinks were served we waited an abnormally long time for our food to come out.... like 40 minutes.  The bartender mentioned something about checking on our order with the kitchen after it had been some time and I know he just forgot to put the order in.  I am familiar with restaurant operations enough to know this wasn't the kitchen's fault. The food eventually came as ordered and it was hot.  We enjoyed our meals... my birthday celebration continues... but then dessert time came around and we were stuffed.  So we opted to get two desserts ""to go"" and after mentioning to the bartender it was my birthday, both desserts were charged on our bill. I don't mind paying for dessert when I order it, but usually one is comped or other surprise and delight gets offered when it is a birthday. I was pretty disappointed with the experience. Also, we had been in a few months ago and one of our entrees was brought to another table so we got to watch each other eat while the other one sat and waited while they remade the entree.  Manager offered apology but nothing else, not even a dessert.  At this point I'm pretty much over this place.  Used to enjoy coming here.  You can see by the amount of check-ins we were frequent guests."
Kris V.,"Cathedral City, CA",0,8,3,3.0,11/18/2017,I do love to go here for a very refreshing drink that they offer best Arnold palmer in town! I really like the carbonara and all the soup of the day esp. caramelized onion soup!  Always check the glass before drinking because I got a BIG chip glass which is not noticeable because the place is too dark!
Brian H.,"Indian Wells, CA",1,6,,5.0,12/19/2017,Our company had a Holiday Luncheon and it was fantastic. My boss knew the waiter and the guy came in on his day off to serve our group. The bartender fixed me a skinny margarita because I have diabetes. The waiter suggested I substitute vegetables for the rice on the Chicken Shrimp Gumbo. It was very filling and my glucose didn't spike 2 hrs. later. The Cheesecake Factory was very efficient even for the large group we had. I'll come back again.
Kathy R.,"Palm Desert, CA",264,203,42,5.0,1/10/2018,"I love the Cheesecake Factory.  Like most people, I am a creature of habit.  There are a handful of items I order routinely.  Like the Caesar salad.  I cannot go and not have it.  Today was no exception.  Today's was low on Garlic but it's always good. And no matter which Cheesecake location you go to it's pretty close to the same. I love the Crispy Chicken Costeletta or the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp.  And the Filet is really good. My husband loves some of the soups. Today is was Mushroom and he enjoyed that.  We've been to this location a few times and I did not review it. Well today was a 5 star experience and worth shouting out about our great server. Tamas.  It was dinner hour and pretty busy.  We got our drink order instantly. We had not decided on our meal but Tamas kept his eye on us. As soon as we were ready, he was there.  In Europe, service is generally pretty stealth - and he was too.  I looked up from my Bang Bang and saw him watching his tables.  He came by a few times to check on us. He did not miss a beat and his station is hopping. We were too full from our dinner to order the yummy Carrot cake but we will be back and hope we get that waiter with the five star service.  All the little things that make dinner out a pleasure were included in the service. Thanks Tamas."
Wendy T.,"Los Angeles, CA",190,193,374,3.0,8/26/2017,"Is it just me, or are chain restaurants in Northern CA better than those in Southern CA? :) I still like this chain because their cheesecakes are always amazing, large portioned, and on point. Everyime I'm at a Cheesecake Factory I always get the chicken marsala with bow tie pasta. This location just doesn't quite make it like the one in San Jose.  Will still come back. Good, large location."
Catie T.,"Yucca Valley, CA",35,52,17,5.0,11/28/2017,This Cheesecake Factory has excellent service and  food came here with my whole family and we all finished our plates food was so good :-)!!
Ari B.,"Tacoma, WA",0,27,5,1.0,11/5/2017,"Okay Russ, I call and tell you what's going on, but much like your hostess and servers, the most you offer is a ""I'm sorry"" 1) you serve my beer in a chipped glass and when I call attention to it Wolfgang, the server, says is I'm sorry- couldn't replace my glass? Comp my beer off my ticket? 2) 40 minutes for sliders and some Thai chicken wraps in a rather empty bar. So the people sitting next to us who walked in after can get their burgers first, but you can't get appetizers out? 3) when the sliders do arrive one of them is missing a bun? Because your line can't check to see if it's correct right?  This was a pretty ridiculous experience. Guess I'll have to jump higher in your echelons to make you see how lousy detail of attention is for your staff. To include you."
Celeste M.,"La Quinta, CA",1427,75,127,5.0,8/2/2017,"Went here for national cheesecake day and it was amazing! Their new birthday cake cheesecake is to die for! We ordered a slice and it looked way to good to eat but I managed... we also ordered a dish which had pesto pasta with chicken and prosciutto which was me in food form! Everything was perfect and so delicious. Service was also great as usual, all the workers are super nice! Worth the money and worth your time to go here! Love Cheesecake Factory for their food and their cheesecake every time I go!"
Ivy M.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,19,1,1.0,12/28/2017,"Called to check on wait time.  Totally get it Russ, you can't quote because it could change.  Explain that I am in the mall area and just trying to decide if your current wait time was going to work with my schedule.  Same reply, sorry we can't tell you that information.   So lame!   We opted to not even give you the opportunity for our business because you were so NOT customer service friendly.  By the way, upgrade your language and find another word for ""sorry.""  Maybe try, ""Our current wait time is ...., however that may change depending on your arrival."""
Lisa S.,"Palm Desert, CA",26,15,77,5.0,11/15/2017,"Hubby and I went on a date here, great atmosphere for that, great bar. The girl at the front desk said it would be 20 to 30 min of wait time...45 min later we finally got seated, our waitress was great. They have a huge menu, kinda overwhelming but we finally did order. Orange Chicken served with white rice and sautèed snow peas, and Chicken and biscuits (which I thought was a disassembled chicken pot pie) served with mashed red  potatoes, both entrèes were delish. The drinks I ordered were all yummylicious a Georgia Peach, The Ultimate Margarita -on the rocks, and the Well-mannered Dirty Martini w/blu cheese olives (the didn't have blu cheese olives tho, they gave me pimento olives) but still yummy, we'd like to go again"
Daniel C.,"Tarzana, CA",198,366,45,4.0,8/13/2017,"Had lunch here when we came into town. We have frequented cheesecake factory in many L.A. locations and now here. Friendly staff and the place is huge with a river as its located in the River plaza. Really nice atmosphere but damn 112 outside and walking to the car was murder. Felt like it was Dubai and trust me I never want to go there as a Jew like me will probably get buried there upon entry !  Food was good as well and they brought out my sons salmon before our food. That was good as my wife could feed him some and everybody was happy.  Look, u can't go wrong with cheesecake factory the menu is simply huuuuge and the houses are abundant. The other huuuge thing is the calories so we stayed with the lunch size portions. I suggest u do too as this country is just getting too fat and not phat like it should be."
maribel g.,"Bonita, CA",23,9,,1.0,12/30/2017,"Always been one of my favorite restaurants however my last experience was really bad. We arrived and gave our name to the hostess and got a buzzer which never buzzed, about 45 minutes later my friend asked and she was told that her name had been called out and that since they didn't find us they just skipped us.  They gave us sitting at the bar, didn't have pasta ...(I know hard believe but true story)so I chose something else from the menu and my food never came, my friend's order came.  When I asked to speak to the manager, she didn't even pretend to be concerned... very disappointed, however, I understood that the kind of service that day was a true reflection of the leadership the team had."
Karen S.,"Palm Springs, CA",70,198,473,4.0,10/20/2017,"Hubby and I were way to early to catch our movie right next door, so we decided to stop in at Cheesecake Factory for a mid afternoon snack.  They have an extensive menu, but I wasnt hungry enough to indulge in a full meal, so we decided on desert. Hubby had the lemon cheesecake torte.  It was lemony, sweet and creamy. Kind of like a lemon drop martini. I had the caramel, white chocolate, macadamia nut cheesecake. It was dreamy. Super sweet, and sinful. The type of desert I would ask for in prison while while waiting to get zapped. Speaking of which, I got a major sugar high. I don't know why I didn't cut in half and bring some home. No, I know why I ate it all. It was THAT GOOD!"
Anthony D.,"Anaheim, CA",30,583,317,5.0,7/23/2017,"Cheesecake Factory may be a chain, but they care about service, they care about quality, and they care about you, the guest. Since 1994 we have been dining at Cheesecake. My first visit was at the Original in Beverly Hills.  Whenever you have an issue, the manager is right at your table to address the issue. Some more expensive places like Morton's is the worst, along with all of that other chains restaurants. They do not care about the guest like Cheesecake does. The food is always excellent, the prices are fair, and the portions are always large. Plus, the Cheesecake is the best. Bravo!"
Heather M.,"Santa Monica, CA",29,511,6,2.0,12/8/2017,"Service lacking. Totally dead in here, but yet still manage to leave patrons waiting, waiting, and waiting to even get acknowledged by wait staff. That def sets the mood for the visit. No apologies or nothing. Awesome. Very cold in here. Overall not thrilled. I won't be back to this location moving forward. Big mistake to even come. Hope ya'all don't get treated this way when you visit. Thumbs down."
Brooke S.,"Freeport, ME",3,36,37,4.0,7/9/2017,"Came here today with my husband for a ""cheat day"" before we start out beach-body 21 day fix! We wanted to have a fun time eating out before we had to start our strict workout and food plan!  We came around 3pm and were amazed by the HUGE menu! Literally anything you could imagine! Mexican, Asian, Italian, American! They have it all! My husband loves Buffalo anything, he found something called the Buffalo blast which was like shredded chicken tossed in Buffalo sauce and cheese then breaded and fried up to perfection! This is actually an appetizer but he enjoyed it as his meal. Would be awesome to share with a few people. I ordered the Skinny-licious Asian chicken salad! Soooo huge, and full of fresh veggies and chicken!!! I will probably dream about that salad!  Of course we had to order cheesecake! So we got the Oreo one to finish! So sweet, and a great last item to eat before the fix starts! The only thing stopping this from five stars would be the fact that when I went to the bathroom my husband told me my napkin fell on the floor and a server walked by picked it up and put it back on the table and never brought me a new one"
Jack H.,"Playa Vista, CA",12,260,,1.0,9/4/2017,"General Manager's responsibility of training and staffing: 1 star  Decor relative to price: 5 stars Service: 1 star  Both hostesses were asked to send our guest our table,  Both neglected to do  it  Waiter was asked to replace a dinner and it took 20 minutes to do it and the replacement meal was not corrected.  His excuse that they were busy was lame.  He never came  back for 2nd drinks or water refills. Salmon was  flavorless 1 star  (returned it) Chicken chili was small quantity but tasty however was very spicy, a surprise 2 stars Shrimp spring rolls were tasty 4 stars Jack H La Qunita"
Lisa T.,"Troutdale, OR",0,5,2,1.0,1/3/2018,"We came into town with 7 in our party at 4:45pm on a Wednesday.  The hostess informed us that the restaurant was already full.  She was cocky, unfriendly and didn't appreciate it that we didn't want to split.  The manager came over and did not want to make any accommodations.   We even offered to sit outside and they wouldn't hear of it.  Disappointed with the attitude.  Thank you, P.F. Chang's.  Our dinner was delightful."
Ceasar C.,"Carlsbad, CA",71,28,1,5.0,12/8/2017,What can I say about this timeless themed restaurant.  They always do a great job with service and tasty treats.  Never regret a visit.
Kim O.,"Morongo Valley, CA",62,143,99,3.0,9/25/2016,"I love that the Cheesecake Factory has such a huge menu. You are guaranteed to find something you like. This specific one is great because it's on the water and has a great patio/ outdoor area where you can enjoy the setting.  I was disappointed with their inaccurate wait times. We were told it would be a twenty minute wait and it ended up being almost an hour. We decided to kill time at the bar. Their menu does not include prices for their drinks, and now I know why. Each drink was around $12!  Our bar tab (only two drinks) was almost as expensive as our meal. While I understand prices like that at some places, I don't feel that the Cheesecake Factory is one of those places."
Nancy F.,"San Diego, CA",128,599,308,4.0,1/26/2017,"This is a great location.  I have been to many locations, and this one is of medium size.  They have a huge patio.  Unfortunately, they are not dog friendly.  I really don't understand this.  The patio is massive.  It must be a corporate thing.  The service here was good.  We had burgers and both were fresh and delicious.  Menu is big and like a book.  I really am not a fan of paging through a book.  They need to simplify that.  The cheesecake is always awesome and so well presented.  They do have a happy hour at 4 pm m-f.  Nice time all the way around."
Ray Ray S.,"Santa Fe Springs, CA",1,36,93,5.0,8/26/2017,"We come here every time we hang out in Palm Springs it's a place you could never go wrong,  appetites are a must we usually order 2 and our main dish ya a lot of food my wife got a Quinoa salad it's a cold dish but very refreshing and light.   We got avocado egg rolls always mad good and Ahi tower which if great I got the BBQ Bacon Burger get extra sauce and have ur burger med-rare it's perfect along with sweet potato fries.  Great staff I always recognize faces and they are all friendly I will always come back never had a bad experience......"
Chris C.,"La Cañada Flintridge, CA",152,123,85,2.0,7/30/2017,"I have always enjoyed going to The Cheesecake Factory at various locations in the past, however this was one horrible noteworthy experience.  We came to this location for my birthday yesterday with a party of 9 people. When I got to the host counter, I was not even greeted, the girl just stood there and starred at me. So I just said my name is Chris and there's 9 of us. I then asked for an approx wait time and she said there's no way of telling me and handed me the pager.  We waited for 45 mins until we decided to ask the host how much longer. She said the table were waiting for was just paying the bill. Another 20 mins goes by and she said that same table just ordered dessert. We waited a total oh 90 mins and must've watched at least 50 people walk out in large groups. We were still never called. I asked if we could sit out on the patio, but she said it's closed.  We decided to no longer waste any time and go elsewhere as it was getting very late and the host still could not tell us how much longer we could wait.  I came to this location last year and waited about 45 mins for a party of two. I totally get they're busy and there's no way of making reservations, but this particular location is the WORST when it comes to wait times. I will not be trying my luck here again. How can management allow an hour and a half or longer to be wait times?"
Jimmy T.,"Portland, OR",42,5,2,1.0,11/11/2017,"A grand looking place, pretty cool place to be. Service was inconsistent but notably disastrous. I wouldn't come back for cheesecake at this particular restaurant and the drinks are the only thing sweetening up my slight bitter disappointment!"
Lisa C.,"La Quinta, CA",2,11,2,1.0,12/28/2017,"No stars. The service was horrible. The host stood and watched as I tried coming into the restaurant with a friend in a wheelchair. Didn't offer any help to hold door open. Our waiter was horrible. And when I tried waving down the manager, or person In charge. Whoever she was. She kept walking. She was in a gray dress. Short red hair. Don't plan on going back. The waiter didn't bring our food. Someone else did. I needed more water. Couldn't even get that. Sad lunch. Sorry we went there. One star for the sweet girl who went and got our waiter so we could get the check and leave. Even that was a task. Ugh"
Janna L.,"Bakersfield, CA",285,1276,928,4.0,12/19/2016,"Great location in Restaurant Row. Cool vibe inside, friendly staff. Loved the bartenders this date. (Mon night) It was a half hour wait for a small table in the dining area so we just opted to eat at the bar once we got our drinks. It was later in the evening so it was relatively calm in the bar. The drinks were good but expensive. IE $12.25 for a small martini. My go-to dish - the garlic chicken farfalle was not the usual star dish I am used to. The chicken was not seasoned at all in the dish and there was not a lot of it. I paid $5 extra for 4 shrimp to be added to the dish. They were smaller than expected and way over cooked on the grill. Rubbery and a waste. So was the pasta, overcooked. Not a lot of sauce was on the plate like it normally would be and the ingredients in the dish were generally sparse. Hubby loved his chicken marsala however, and was able to sub pasta for mashed potatoes. This chicken was prepped quite differently (properly) and the mushrooms were delicious! We had such good service, we said nothing about my food. We politely declined the cheesecake offered for purchase at the end of every meal and finished our drink to leave. We only get to a beloved CF once a year or so. It was good but could have been a bit more special with some food/expediter quality control. I would come back and give them another shot though!"
Steven F.,"Palm Springs, CA",4,3,1,1.0,11/15/2017,"Me and my family celebrated my cousin's birthday last Nov. 12,2017 at around 8pm. My husband ordered a glass of Arnold Palmer and  he didn't notice a big chip to the mouth glass because it was covered with sugar and he consumed half of the glass before my cousin noticed it. The reason he didn't see it because the restaurant is TOO DARK! I hope nothing happens to my husband."
Yadi E.,"San Marcos, CA",361,186,340,5.0,7/3/2016,"My close friends treated me to a nice dinner here for my birthday a while ago. I really wanted to try something new this time, but I always chicken out and get the barbecue burger with their delicious fries!! One friend ordered the regular burger and the other ordered the small cheese pizza! All of our entrees were amazing and I love the consistency of this restaurant. Never fails! After my meal, the staff surprised me with the Reece's cheesecake that my friends ordered ahead of time, it was a great time!! Also, I came for a lite lunch a couple days ago, and ordered their oriental salad from their delightful menu. The salad was HUMUNGOUS!! At least 3 servings in the one size salad. Next time I'm getting the yummy dressing on the side to prevent soggy lettuce. But yes, there will be a next time:)"
Auggie R.,"Cathedral City, CA",0,3,1,1.0,11/11/2017,I Usually have great service their food is goo but today we got the Worse server EVER!! We order our drinks and got them by the time our food was almost out how hard can it be to take two green tea? Then I ask my server for a refill and never got it I got up to talk to the manager she seem nice and after I explain what had happen she offer a slice of cheese cake really?? Is this how she expect to keep costumers happy wow she needs some training once they get me upset I was not even able to enjoy my meal. This was a place I really enjoy coming in and now this has change the way I think of the Cheesecake Factory  I don't know if I'll comeback again. Most likely not
Jacqueline M.,"Palm Springs, CA",134,197,436,4.0,12/23/2016,Cheesecake Factory is a corporate chain but the food was good especially the avocado toast.  The service was excellent and the portions large plus the cheesecake is wonderful!
Zachariah V.,"Riverside, CA",4,11,2,1.0,10/30/2017,Had plastic film in my food. I guess it was microwaved and not fresh??? That or some how plastic film got thrown in it. Either way makes me not want to come back.
L W.,"Torrance, CA",2,9,3,4.0,6/4/2017,"Last night, four of us came here for dinner around 7pm.  We were there to celebrate my daughter and her friends birthdays.  The two of them sat at a different table - works for me.   The reception staff was overwhelmed and unfriendly.  So much so that it prompted me to want to write this review.  The women checking people in couldn't be bothered to make eye contact or smile.  They took your name, gave you a pager and literally never looked up.  When the pager went off, We returned it to the reception desk and were told to listen for our name?  Why were we paged if you weren't ready to seat us?  Again, the most deadpan expression on the girls face.  A few minutes later, We were seated by Brett.  This young man, saved this review!!! I asked if he could let the server at my daughters table know that I would be paying their bill and that it was the girls birthdays.  I realize this can be a pain in the neck for busy restaurants, but I always show my appreciation with a generous tip.  Brett went above and beyond to make sure this happened.  He brought the other check to my table directly, checked in after to make sure all was taken care of and always had a smile and pleasant tone.  I asked to speak to the manager because I like to let them know of a problem before blasting them on YELP.  Also, I think employees that make a difference because of exceptional service should be pointed out too! Tim, the manager, came by and I explained what had happened at reception and how Brett had gone above and beyond and that I would be leaving this review.  He explained that the receptionists were fill in runner staff because of call outs and that he would let them know that a smile goes a long way.  Even on a busy night that you are thrown curve balls.  Thanks for stopping by Tim! The food was Cheesecake Factory - good and consistent. Brett, Jimmy and Mathew were tipped well because they smiled and provided excellent service.  Thank you for making my daughter and her friend feel special on their 16th birthdays."
Sarah D.,"Orange County, CA",90,86,35,4.0,6/21/2017,"Consistent Food quality and service. For a chain restaurant, I love that the options are endless and the food is always good. I ordered my go to dish Chicken Picatta and it was just as I expected it to be. Bonus was they allowed the stroller at the table which is awesome for tired parents."
Jane D.,"Los Angeles, CA",434,37,4,1.0,4/13/2017,We ordered take out at night. It was made very sloppy ..they missed cheese and sauce on the sliders so they were dry. We decided to come here for lunch the next day. My sandwich was burned. My boyfriends food was good though. But didn't expect this from cheesecake. Won't b back at this location in the future.
Bill J.,"Phoenix, AZ",3,215,84,3.0,8/3/2017,"Our Server name was Kiel ,he was Fine No Dedicated Internet -* I ordered the veggie Burger -*, not cooked Crisp as I requested & was told could be done. Cheesecake Selection near entrance was inpressive​  ,I will return."
A H.,"Indio, CA",0,1,,2.0,12/22/2017,"The food was good as it is on any occasion, however I am shocked to share that we were all deeply disappointed and unsatisfied with the caliber of service we were provided with during our visit. Most of the people in our party suggested going elsewhere during our extended wait for the waitress to tend to our requests. Our party spent a reasonable amount of money for this dinner with an expectation of quality food AND service; we felt this standard was not met. I have submitted a letter in regards to our negative experience and have YET to receive any sort of response to my concern. This recent experience indefinitely deters my family and friends from celebrating future group occasions at this establishment. This was the last place I would expect poor service from!"
Ashley K.,"Phoenix, AZ",24,15,,5.0,9/14/2017,"Must say this place is one of a kind. It's not the best but it beats a lot of other places similar to this. Food is on point don't care to much for the cheesecake, but they are worth the it from the atmosphere to the food I will recommend this place to others"
Saralee P.,"Cathedral City, CA",34,3,1,1.0,12/16/2017,"I tried to make a reservation for 5 people. Unfortunately they only reserve for 8. Greedy much? We are great tippers and regulars diners, but I guess our party size doesn't get the same accommodations. I dine in for the experience, and waiting 25-30 minutes to enjoy a dinner w the family, doesn't sound like a good time. Sorry, we will dine elsewhere"
McKenzey B.,"La Quinta, CA",1,63,40,1.0,9/26/2016,"It's been awhile (6 months) since we are here. We stopped coming because of lousy service and the food started going downhill. So after waiting awhile and hoping for new management and a makeover- we got our wish but the make over needs a do over. It's worse now then what it was. I went specifically for the Monte Cristo Sandwhich as they were the only place that did it halfway decent. Oklahoma does it the best.  It was horrible. They changed the type of bread from what they use to use. I LIKED WHAT YOU HAD, why change a good thing? Next the egg took up the whole sandwhich (inch thickness) with the smallest piece of bacon (which I prefer not to have), and the thinnest slice of ??? ham ???? turkey ??? It was so thin I have no idea what it was. Last but not least the mozzarella cheese or swiss had a funky taste like it was old. It was the worst sandwich I ever had. One has to question at what lengths does a restaurant go to in order to skimp on food to save money? This customer would rather pay more and get a decent meal!!"
