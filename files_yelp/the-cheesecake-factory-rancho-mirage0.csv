Katy Y.,"San Gabriel, CA",15,660,512,3.0,6/26/2014,"Slow service. Came here on a Monday evening at 8 and didn't get seated until 8:20 ish. Menu, bread and drinks came soon after... But when we asked for an extra minute to look at the menu- it was a whole 10 min later... Food took long to arrive. We were all starving and chowed down the food. By the time we finished, it was 10 pm!!  Not sure why the table next to ours was offered a survey and a $10 giftcard if they completed it and we didn't get that. Boo!  But the food and drinks taste consistently good like their chain.  Nice waitress though."
Paul E.,"La Verne, CA",97,10,1,1.0,3/30/2015,"The worst Cheesecake Factory on the planet. Manager had to hit every table to apologize for our server (Melissa) not giving a crap about messed up orders, temperature in building, etc."
William J.,"Palm Springs, CA",8,5,,3.0,10/22/2015,"My wife and I picked up my daughter after school this afternoon, and she said that she wanted to use her birthday gift-card to try the cheesecake at the CcF.  We sat down and placed our orders, had 3 glorious and decadent pieces of cheesecake in front of us a few minutes later.  Within 2 bites of the cake our waitress place the bill in front of us...2 bites later she returned to ask if I had taken care of the bill, to which I replied ""no""...a minute later she dragged another waitress to our table and informed us that she was off shift and that this other girl would take care of our bill.  Her intrusions at our table while we were eating were rude and uncalled for, I expect a lot more server etiquette from a place like the Cheesecake Factory!"
Fundios ..,"Rosamond, CA",0,16,16,4.0,8/10/2014,What a great place....but what keeps bringing us back is the CHILI RELLENO BURGER..what a great burger..i love it...food is great here..
Callie B.,"Palm Springs, CA",1,4,,4.0,10/19/2015,"Recently went to celebrate my birthday with some friends and was very pleased. Had a total party of 8 and were ready to seat us before some guests even arrived! Waiter was very nice even though I insisted on no singing, he proceeded to slide over a birthday cup of ice cream and sprinkles while the entire restaurant rejoiced. Got the eggplant parmesan and it was fantastic. Love this restaurant and will return soon."
Animal-Lover J.,"La Quinta, CA",10,203,62,3.0,7/2/2015,"OMG this place is LOUD! Pretty building but no buffer for noise. Not much food variety, but the cheesecakes are always super yummy. Expensive, but yummy."
Ruby Y.,"Palm Desert, CA",51,55,100,5.0,6/1/2015,"Came in Saturday for lunch after my daughter's graduation and our server happened to be the sign language interpreter at Shadow Hills High School.  I wish I would have remembered his name (Doh) amazing service! I must say every time I go to the Cheesecake Factory the service has been good, but on Saturday it was beyond my expectations.  I always order salmon.  The miso salmon is good, but the server recommended the herb crusted salmon and I was happy I chose it.  The lunch portion was still plentiful and it was flavorful and delicious.  I highly recommend it.  Can't wait to go back."
Nikki M.,"Palm Springs, CA",23,45,3,5.0,7/13/2015,This place is heavily!! Every cheese factory I've visited has been amazing!! I highly recommend everything on there menu!!! So yummy ing don't get me started on there delicious cheesecake
Corky Z.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,18,10,3.0,6/7/2016,My friend and i order same thing at Cheesecake Factory..crusted Romano chicken and request alfredo sauce.  The plate had a sauce the consistency of milk with tons of pepper.   Didnt taste like any alfrrdo sauce I've ever had. Brought it to the attention of the waitress and she asked us if we put all the pepper on it...nope we didn't. We asked for more sauce and it did taste better.  Of course by the time the sauce came the meal is cold.  Manager did come by table to make sure we liked the new sauce saying sorry. In my opinion a true sorry would have been to offer us a free piece of cheesecake or something....
Lina M.,"Dusseldorf, Germany",17,69,16,3.0,4/13/2015,"Went there with my hubby, mentioned that it's his birthday, nothing happend...... The waitress was in hurry, I think they don't have enough staff. Anyway, the food was good, the rest not ."
Darren B.,"Costa Mesa, CA",1,18,,1.0,4/9/2016,"Went to dinner here last night with my wife. We ordered an appetizer drinks and main courses. The drinks, appetizer and the fish and chips were great. Our sever was great. I ordered the lemon herbed chicken and it was terrible. I can't remember the last time I sent an entree back at a restaurant but I had to this time. The chicken tasted like it was a few days old. I sent it back and asked for something different. 10 minutes later the manager came by and literally said ""can you please tell me why you didn't like the dish because you ate most of it."" I almost fell out of my chair in shock of how rude she was. I had maybe 4 or 5 bites of the plate and sent it on its way. I told her that is wasn't good and that I would pay for the dish even though I barely had any. I don't need her charity. She was so rude that another manager overheard the conversation and was so embarrassed that he wanted to cover our entire bill. I said absolutely not and I paid for everything. I didn't want that terrible manager to get her way by thinking she can completely insult customers and cover her rear end by paying for our bill. I have worked in the restaurant industry in my 20's and if I ever did what she did I would have been fired on the spot. Take a look at their reviews here on Yelp, there is a reason they only have 3.5 stars! I sent an email to corporate and told the general manager of our experience. Let's see what they will do about it. Completely ruined our night. Shame on her!"
Steven H.,"Palm Springs, CA",13,19,,1.0,1/25/2016,What a joke. The food is junk. The service is horrible and the manager there Tim is why this place is has got awful. Not to mention they were inspected by the health department for several cases of food poisoning going on there. I would never eat there again until they get better management and better cooks.
Bryan B.,"Palm Springs, CA",1,4,3,5.0,1/23/2015,"Had a great dinner with my wife.  The spicy pineapple margarita was amazing.  Buffalo Wings with blue cheese dressing, Chicken Madeira with extra sauce, and the strawberry shortcake.  I am beyond satisfied.  Amanda was an amazing server.  She killed it.  She runs her own food and busses her own tables, the whole time providing amazing service, all with a full section.  She deserves some sort of recognition.  Honestly though, I thought duh a nice place would have bussers and food runners/expo people.  How could the managers put all of that on the servers?  Nonetheless, Amanda handled the business with ease.  Will definately return and ask to be in her section :)"
Sam S.,"Redlands, CA",143,94,117,3.0,4/21/2015,"Dont come here often , but we drove the hr to do something different..... Ordered drinks , and the waitress never checked in on us to order our meal... We finally flagged her down, she had way too much going on and couldn't keep up ... We ordered our food and bread.... We never got any bread and we were never even offered water...... wondered  if that was on purpose or not (water)  Not that anxious to return...."
Daisy C.,"Palm Desert, CA",0,5,,5.0,5/12/2016,"Probably one of my favorite places to go when we can't decide what to eat. They have every type of food and the staff is friendly. Recently we discovered their happy hour at the bar and I have to say, the burger on their menu for happy hour is a really great price for what we received. Amazing! And we can't ever leave without trying a different cheesecake every time."
K E.,"Carlsbad, CA",4,74,,3.0,9/7/2015,"I don't get this place.  It doesn't seem to matter what time you go there, the ""snotty"" unfriendly greeters ALWAYS make you wait even when there are open tables or sitting in the bar where you can get full menu items but never offered.  It's not the Ritz, it's in a shopping mall !!!  These greeters act like it's sacred ground you have entered.  I either eat in the bar and hope Emerson the bartender, is working....he's excellent and great personality along with a good drink maker.   Their food is ok.  There is a nice patio seating but you can't see the menus since it's not well lite.  When the other restaurants are busy like 5Guys, Yard house, p f changs or Babe's BBQ, then I will call for take out.  Gotta give them credit for their desserts...they are yummy.  I am tired of the attitude host or hostess will give when you are the paying customer. Parking can be an issue too"
Stephanie C.,"Sierra Madre, CA",13,15,15,4.0,4/26/2015,Adam was a great server. Got our order in and out and everything tasted good. Even humored our son and his jokes. Was stuffed when we left.
Bree F.,"San Diego, CA",43,8,,1.0,5/24/2015,"Just showed up for brunch, not a single person in the restaurant and requested for a patio table. We brought our dog, which we have several other occasions to this exact same restaurant, and was denied table due to them not being pet friendly. This would not be an issue if we have not been able to bring him before. Not only that, but three staff members made the comment that it is due to new management and not ""health code regulations"".  We left and took our business elsewhere that somehow doesn't have the same ""regulations"" as the Cheesecake Factory. Very disappointed."
Fawn W.,"Temecula, CA",46,23,11,5.0,3/1/2014,Went here for lunch today was great and our server was awesome great drinks good food happy tummy happy husband happy wife thanks Stacy your the best.........
Cindy B.,"Indian Wells, CA",5,23,11,4.0,11/26/2013,Me and my boyfriend eat at cheesecake about every week or so. Their drinks are great the food is really good and the prices are fair. We have always had great servers.  Their lettuce wraps are delicious! We've never had a huge issue here. Sometimes it looks like the tables can be wiped down a little better but besides that I've always have had a good experience here.
