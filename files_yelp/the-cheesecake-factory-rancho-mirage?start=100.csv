Shene S.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,10,2,1.0,7/23/2017,"DISAPPOINTING CHEESECAKE FACTORY. Usually you're very good...This place has slow service, and throws your to go food away. The food was good! My pasta was so delicious I wanted to save half of it for tomorrow. But then when the server (older woman, Caucasian, worked Saturday night 7/23/17) asked if I wanted my food to go and I replied ""yes please""... she threw out my dish instead of packing it to go as she said she would. Then said she would have the manager bring out another one.... 20min later... brings out a smaller portion of the dish she threw away! I mean... come on!!! YOU THREW AWAY MY DISH! And now gave me a replacement that was even smaller (and looked less appetizing). RIDICULOUS. Every restaurant knows you replace YOUR MISTAKE with a new dish or take it off the bill."
Viviana G.,"Cathedral City, CA",2,6,2,5.0,10/30/2016,"Went to have dinner tonight with my son and boyfriend and Franky our server was amazing! (His real name is Francisco) He came to us as soon as we were seated and even gave us cut up pieces of bread and slices of banana for my 8 month old son! He did that for us without us having to ask or before it even crossed my mind which shows how much he pays attention to the little things. Not to mention he also offered something to drink for our little one, so sweet. You don't get service like that these days from everywhere you dine at. He took the time to talk to us and all of his guests for that matter. He checked on us at all the right times to make sure we were really enjoying our meal. I truly hope the managers at The Cheesecake Factory see what an asset this gentleman is. Thank you Franky for being so kind and we look forward to seeing you again! :)"
Teresa W.,"North Hollywood, CA",1,13,14,3.0,7/25/2015,I was really shocked to see that the smothered chicken and biscuit dish was in fact not smothered. Not only that but when I asked for it to be smothered they poured this thin soup like gravy over the dish. Extremely disappointing.  The dish was traditionally made with a thick white gravy that smothered the biscuits. And the biscuits were traditionally cut in halves and put in the mashed potatoes.  This was nothing like that and definitely a disappointing meal.
Niki M.,"Berkeley, CA",256,343,174,4.0,7/8/2015,"We were surprised to have a long wait on a Tuesday night mid-summer, but after thirty minutes, we did finally get a table.  We were glad that this Cheesecake Factory location has more booths than many of the locations, and they seem to be using the long rows mainly for large parties instead of trying to sandwich groups next to one another.   For starters, my husband and I split the Asian salad and ordered it without meat, since we are vegetarian. It was HUGE.  Big enough for two people for sure, maybe three or four.  It's almost like the food here should be ordered ""family style.""  Then, we shared the margherita pizza, which was oddly kind of over cooked. The cheese was burned in places, although the crust was not.  Our waiter was fantastic... until we had finished our meal. They triple sat him at the same time, and he was so busy getting them started that we waited a really long time to order desert and get our check, but he realized that it had happened and got our desserts and check wrapped up super fast once he came around."
Skylani B.,"Rancho Mirage, CA",81,1,,5.0,7/29/2017,"Love the food here! Overall extremely good & nice waiters, food has never disappointed me. Cheesecake is delicious. Strawberry lemonade is the best in town! Is always pretty busy, but is worth the wait"
Jessica R.,"Costa Mesa, CA",70,76,159,5.0,5/27/2016,Lisa was great! I came in quickly for a coffee and dessert of course. I had never had dined here before and I had a great experience. The hostesses made Me feel very welcome. She made small talk with me on our way to my nice booth. I even got a nice view! Lisa was kind and very knowledgable. I felt very spontaneous and because they have a huge variety of desserts I told her to choose the best dessert they had. I had a very tasty caramel macchiato and a Kalhua cheesecake that I enjoyed very much. I can't wait to go back and try another dessert with my macchiato.
Christopher B.,"La Quinta, CA",108,8,1,2.0,8/8/2016,"They have changed the chicken Madeira . It is substandard. The manager came and stated that he would remake it better, sadly it was the same. We love this place, but we have noticed a change. The manager did delete one plate from Bill."
Paul B.,"Palm Springs, CA",2,18,,5.0,1/1/2017,Once again had just the perfect meal here. Service was really attentive. Great place.
Elaine J.,"Newport Beach, CA",0,44,,3.0,12/31/2016,"Wow for $65 for 2 for lunch( no beverages) we had a horrible meal. Should have gone to subway instead.  Quality of our salads was poor and the salmon was overcooked and fishy. I had to return the salmon, since it was not Edible, and almost 15 min later received a somewhat acceptable piece as a substitute.  Mgmt was apologetic, but for the money spent, a bad experience. At least the cheesecake was good. They sent me a $50 gift card which was quite nice"
Piper F.,"Palm Springs, CA",0,84,11,4.0,12/31/2016,A little something for everyone!  Never mind the wait (if you have a line up waiting on check-in) peek around the corner and check to see if there is room at the bar.  The friendly staff was super accommodating for our large group of 8 and thankful for the option for some of us to wait with a glass of wine while the younger members of our crew went and did a little shopping and walking around the River.  Service was great and food arrived promptly.  Make sure to save some room to share a piece of cheesecake for dessert.
Kathy G.,"Palm Desert, CA",0,10,3,5.0,8/9/2016,My kids LOVE their chicken tenders...I LOVE the vegan Cobb salad. I'm not vegan but am cutting down on meat consumption so I tried this salad and OMG it was insanely delicious!
JAna G.,"Seattle, WA",0,15,6,5.0,11/21/2016,"A good eating place and always reliable. Service was fast and friendly. Servings are large and tasty. When we don't know where to eat, the Cheesecake Factory is where we go. Save room for the huge dessert!"
Kayla J.,"Palm Desert, CA",1,16,,3.0,7/1/2017,"Didn't have the best lunch outing at the Cheesecake Factory today. Although I really like the large variety of options on the menu, the food never actually tastes as good as it looks in pictures. It's always either too much seasoning or not enough. I had a pasta dish and it was way too oily. I gave up trying to enjoy it not even half way through and picked at my husband's food instead. And even his food seemed a little on the bland side. Not going to call anyone out by name, but our waitress was particularly horrible. It took her forever to even come get us started with appetizers and then to get our main course order. She took much too long between checking up on us and even kept forgetting to bring the additional things we asked for, like a side of ranch for my fries and my friend's new drink order. It didn't even seem too busy while we were there. Other than the food consistently being only okay, I've had better visits so hopefully this was just a bad day."
Joseph M.,"Desert Hot Springs, CA",39,68,49,5.0,10/15/2016,Great service! Wish they had name tags so I could give credit where it's due. Food was prompt and delish. Dessert was amazing!
Stephanie G.,"Rancho Mirage, CA",4,59,4,4.0,11/6/2016,"Everything you'd expect from this popular chain.  Great service, delicious meals, vast menu selection, decadent desserts and long wait times at peak meal hours.  Safe, predictable and fun.  A mainstay."
Grace M.,"Palm Springs, CA",594,284,1206,3.0,2/28/2015,"The food is fairly good, portions are huge. I usually get a salad and split it, or just take half it home. Basically only go to this place for their cheesecake! They have such a large selection of cheesecakes! And they all sound nummies! So I can never order just one. Service is a hit or miss. I normally go there for lunch *great lunch place | prefer it over dinner* The restaurant is in a great location - At the River. If you have a sweet tooth & like cheesecake. This is obviously the place to go. I like how there's a Cheesecake Factory everywhere! :)"
J C.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,44,2,5.0,12/17/2016,I've never had a bad meal here. It's ALWAYS consistent and delicious. I highly recommend the Mexican Tostada Salad and Beef Medallions off the Skinny menu.
Carol S.,"Cathedral City, CA",0,1,,2.0,12/11/2016,"Stopped in to pick-up some dessert. We stood for 5 minutes while 3 servers stood behind the bar with 2 looking at the register and another leaning on the back counter. No one made eye contact or said they would be with us in a minute. We said I guess no one wants to wait on us. It was slow, no waiting for a table so we left letting the hostess know we were ignored. We used to bring visitors here but not anymore."
Kat D.,"Meridian, ID",147,179,150,4.0,2/9/2015,"Went to lunch with my BFF here a few days ago. Let's face it, I only go to cheesecake factory for the Brown bread and the cheesecake! Lol. Those are the only foods that I require in life! My friend and I ate outside. It was nice and clean. Our server was a bit scattered. My friend ordered an avocado chicken sandwich with onion rings and I had the fried chicken and biscuits. My friend was happy with her meal. The only negatives were that there was a lot of produce on the sandwich. The slices of tomato were literally over twice the thickness of the chicken. The onion rings though....oh my heck! Amazing! My food was ok. Nothing spectacular. UNTIL....we ordered the cheesecake. We each ordered the lemon meringue pie cheesecake. It was so delicious. I am craving it as I type this out! I will be back to CF because I just have such a deep love for the cheesecake."
Nicole G.,"Indio, CA",0,2,,5.0,6/3/2017,"Amazing, Food and Service. Always consistent. The spinach artichoke dip was great, the pasta divinci was perfect and my little ones chicken strips were fresh and crispy."
