ray t.,"Saratoga, CA",2,59,,4.0,4/16/2017,Came here for dinner on a Wednesday night with a group of 9. I got the thai coconut curry chicken and it was delicious! Service was very friendly and attentive and their kid menu is good.  I'd definitely come here again.
Helen C.,"Twentynine Palms, CA",22,18,8,5.0,3/21/2016,"Great service. Good food. We went close to closing so we didn't have to deal with a wait time or poor service. I had the butternut squash chicken tacos. They are amazing! Love the cheese cake! Fried zucchini was okay, I've has better but I like to eat mine with Alfredo sauce and hands down they have the best Alfredo sauce I've ever had! Good prices also!"
Kristyn K.,"Lake Forest, CA",0,2,,1.0,11/5/2016,This restraunt DOES NOT care about their customers. We waited well over an hour for a table for 9. They attempted to split us up even though we were there for a birthday. The staff was not friendly or accommodating for the long wait. We watched every person that walked up to the hostess stand get seated before us. Such a disappointment.
Suzy S.,"West Covina, CA",0,25,21,3.0,1/5/2016,"Atmosphere: Classic Cheesecake Factory decor located at the beautiful River in Rancho Mirage. Clean and very spacious lay out.  Food: unfortunately food left much to be desired. Most cheesecake factories are spot on with their food (at leAst the few I've been to) BUT lately food has been not up to par. We ordered the clam chowder, steak Diana and hanger steak. Clam chowder tasted good but was more like a potato soup. Tons of potato, little clam. The steak Diana and hanger steak were okay on taste (nothing to brag about) but we're not hot when served. This is something I've experienced at other cheesecake factories the last few months as well. Food isn't hot when served. Food was warm but you could tell it had been sitting for a while cooling down to almost room temp. Disappointing. Service: service was okay. We came in on New Years. Our server came by a couple of times to check on us. Nothing special about service."
Lav L.,"Riverside, CA",1,134,113,4.0,2/12/2016,"Headed to desert for an overnight getaway, stopped by around 2pm. Not crowded at all. Our waitress, Anna maria, was pleasant and attentive. Crab cake balls were delish. Hubby got pork chop meal and I got meatloaf meal. I luv that they have the squaw bread with butter. Also their tropical tea and mint tea is good. Tried salted caramel cheesecake, OMG,,,so good. Time to see a movie..Enjoy!!!"
Kim Z.,"Schenectady, NY",6,9,,5.0,10/28/2015,Good service and amazing food!   I really recommend everyone to try the avocado roll for appetizer.
Kaylin O.,"Los Alamitos, CA",8,30,65,5.0,8/22/2016,"My parents and I came to this restaurant and had an amazing time. The wait was short, the food was great, and most importantly...the cheesecake was PHENOMENAL!!!  We told the waiter our number of people and we were immediately guided to a table. Once we order our food we got it in about 15 or 20 minutes. Its not super quick but its A LOT better than Ive experienced (Check out my review for the Healthier Place To Eat).  Once we received the cheesecake a was in awe as my mouth dropped. It was perfection. It was the Dream Extreme Oreo Cheesecake. It was everything I ever dreamed of (Haha just kidding). It had different layers of cheese (Im guessing). Vanilla then chocolate. Vanilla then chocolate. Over and over again. The crust was made out of oreos and the frosting was chocolate. It had a little swirl of chocolate frosting and oreo crumbs on top with one big oreo on top too. It was delicious! And I totally recommend it! I will definitely be revisiting The Cheesecake Factory the next chance I get!!"
Kaylyn S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,205,10,4.0,8/8/2016,"A small group of us stopped in for lunch on a Tuesday.  Our server was very attentive and helpful.  All requests, no matter how special, were met quickly and pleasantly.  The salads and pastas were ordered were fresh.  Yes, it is just a ""standard"" Cheesecake Factory (same architecture and menu as any other CF), but the service was great and the food was good and fresh."
Pan Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,47,2,4.0,4/16/2016,"I always enjoy eating at the Cheesecake Factory. The staff are friendly and the food is good. As a lone diner though, I was bummed I couldn't get cell-phone reception. I like to read the news while eating and all I was able to do was constantly hit ""reload."""
Jazzy G.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",1,126,29,4.0,2/27/2016,"This is a beautiful location if compared with the others within a 40 mile vicinity. The River is a nice place with a really cool ambiance. We had about a 20 minute wait and promptly scored a window seat.  We ordered crab wontons as an appetizer. They were just ""okay"" and we wouldn't get them again. Our meals were good though.  Service was pleasant, but a tad slow moving. It was busy so I get that. We were so full we declined on dessert, which is always the happy ending!  This is our favorite location out of all the others we've dined at."
Sara D.,"Palm Springs, CA",27,117,42,3.0,1/2/2016,"Been here for happy hour and regular dining with large groups and just my husband, so this review is a general one.  Service: somewhat slow, but you'll get better service with a large group than just a few people. I'm guessing they're motivated by the bigger tip. Bartender is slooooww during happy hour, so don't expect to order multiple drinks. 2/5 stars Food: chicken bellagio is my go to entree, meatloaf for my husband. Overpriced for the quality (mass produced, prepared), but reasonable for the portions. Most dishes surpass daily calorie limits. 3.5/5 stars Atmosphere: loud enough that the table next to you won't eavesdrop, but still able to hold a conversation. Busy on weekends and during season with Canadians (sept-april). Patio is nice most of the time. 4/5 stars"
Sami M.,"Palm Desert, CA",126,13,4,4.0,5/31/2016,"I like this place very much. Great service, nice people, and awesome food. I only wish hot foods, such as fries and burgers would be served hot. But it's a busy place and you cant blame them."
Angel H.,"Burlington, IA",30,24,1,4.0,3/9/2016,"The moment I walked in to this beautiful restaurant I noticed the gorgeous paintings on the ceiling! Next I loved being surrounded by the smell of fresh flowers, and good food in the air! I love this place!"
Jasmine S.,"Van Nuys, Los Angeles, CA",87,165,509,3.0,11/9/2014,"This place is definitely over priced in my opinion, but I just came for the half off cheesecake. I've had their cheesecakes before, but it's been a while. I took my mom as well to try and get her to eat. She wanted the soup, but they only had one soup. I wish they had a bigger selection on soup. I understand it's called Cheesecake Factory, so they specialize in cheesecake but really one soup? She didn't like anything on the menu, she's picky so it's hard. I know she loves bread (she'll eat loaves of bread like chips which is quite odd in my opinion). So I asked for a side of bread, my mom liked the bread. I tried it and it was really yummy. Anyways I mainly wanted to write this review about their cheesecake. They have a pretty huge selection. I didn't know what to get, but I was craving white chocolate so I got the white chocolate caramel macadamia but cheesecake. I was tired too so I decided to get coffee with my cheesecake. The coffee was whatevs (it taste like coffee from regular coffee you brew at home). The cheesecake was really sweet, but in my opinion the macadamia but to cheesecake ratio was too much. They put too much nuts and they added way to much whip cream. Whip cream is good, but they added it on tripod the cheesecake and then to the side (which is way to much!). Another thing I want to add is that the cheesecake was really sweet, probably too sweet. I don't recall cheesecake being that sweet. I felt like it was too much for me to be honest (I could probably only eat half of that cheesecake slice) Also our server was really nice! However I changed my mind because she kept walking by our table and didn't ask us if we wanted any more water or if I wanted a refill on my coffee. I tried to get her attention, but she didn't come. I waited like 10 minutes. I just felt like she neglected our table because we only ordered the cheesecake. I had to get another server to get the check and to get me a refill on the coffee (she was really nice and apologized). She was really helpful and nice! I just think no matter what a customer orders that the server checks up on them"
Mark S.,"Peoria, AZ",35,41,25,4.0,7/17/2016,Always good food at Cheesecake Factory. Service was good. Restaurant could of been cleaner. Table was not cleaned well and dirty silverware under the table.
N Y.,"Burbank, CA",46,11,10,4.0,12/26/2015,it's a Cheesecake Factory so you know what to expect. I always order the Louisiana Chicken Pasta - changing the pasta to angel hair. The free brown bread is always awesome too.  It's always hard to get servers' attention when I ask for my check. I've been here a few times and it's always the same. Not sure why.
Powell H.,"Simi Valley, CA",0,32,,1.0,4/3/2017,Never been treated so disrespected all the while the staff  smiled and and ruined the food at the same time. Would never recommend to pay to be treated like crap. The manager on shift was a man is a collared shirt with a bald head that did not seem to give two craps. Horrible long service. I will not be going back. I may be wrong but think they are all owned by the same person so I think I am on VETO to the cheesecake factory .This treatment has happened one too many times at this establishment.
Guy T.,"Klamath Falls, OR",0,107,,3.0,1/24/2017,"Went to Cheesecake Factory for lunch. The fish and chips were as good as it gets for frozen fish. The service was average. I assumed wrongly that my soda was refillable, but discovered a $3 charge for each refill when I got the bill. Thats kind of sneaky. Probably will go back to try some signature cheese cake."
Flo M.,"Cathedral City, CA",5,10,3,5.0,2/4/2016,"Thank you DANIEL ALMENDARIZ VIRREY, Your service here at the cheesecake factory was amazing... The filet mignon was absolutely delicious... Keep up the good work. I would definitely come back to see you again."
Karen L.,"Palm Desert, CA",11,107,14,1.0,12/3/2015,"Have been here many times. Always loved it.  Today was terrible.  The service was terrible.  Waiter was not physically able to keep up. Made us late when we had an HOUR to kill!! ,  i will update status once dining experience is good again.  Management should contact me"
