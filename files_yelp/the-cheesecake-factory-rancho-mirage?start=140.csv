Angie M.,"Cherry Valley, CA",0,2,2,1.0,7/30/2017,"This review is based on my visit on 07/30/2017. My family and I were told it was going to be an hour wait for a party of 8. We decided to wait it out. While we were waiting we noticed parties of 6 and 7 get were getting seated before us. Once the hour passed, I went up to the hostess and mentioned that it had been an hour and we still had not been seated. She told me that they were waiting for a large party to get up, and that large parties usually dine in for an hour and a half. She mentioned that the party had been dining in for 2 hours now, so the table should be available soon. I thought it was ridiculous that our chances of getting seated depended on this particular table. It's a huge restaurant, tables can be rearranged to accommodate their customers. But I kept my comments to myself. After waiting for 1.5 hours, I brought it up again to the hostess. The manager just happened to be standing right by her. He didn't even apologize for our wait. He simply used the same excuse the hostess had used. At this point my family and I were very frustrated, but we had waited too long to leave. After waiting for 1 hour and 45 minutes, I went up to the hostess a third time. I got the same excuse. This time I did bring it up to their attention and mentioned that we were never going to get seated if our chances of getting seated depended on this ONE table. We saw families that were there before us go in and out, meanwhile we were still waiting for a table. But both the hostess and the manager didn't seem to care. After waiting almost 2 hours we finally got seated. Our waiter was Maggie, she was AMAZING. We let her know we had waited 2 hours to get seated and we were all ready to order. She sincerely apologized, and proceeded to take our drink order along with our meal order. She provided 5 star service! But this review is about the customer service we received from the manager CHARLES. At the end of our visit I decided to head over to the Cheesecake counter because I wanted to see their options as opposed to looking at their menu. They were having a promotion and cheesecakes were 50% off. I purchased 2, and handed the cashier a $20 bill. When I got my receipt I noticed I only received a discount for 1 of those cheesecakes. The same manager from earlier happened to be standing there so I brought it up to his attention. He rudely told me it was one discount per person, which is understandable. But I said to him that I had 7 other people with me, so I wasn't abusing the promotion. I also said to him that I'm sure he remembered me from earlier because I had spoken to him about waiting 2 hours to get seated in his restaurant. He laughed and rolled his eyes, and behaved like a 13 year old teenage girl would. At this point I had enough, I asked if he could process a return for the cheesecakes. This so called ""manager"" didn't even know how to process a return. He struggled for a while, and finally made some other employee process it for him. First of all, he shouldn't manage a restaurant if he has no sense of customer service. And second, if a manager can't do something as simple as work the register he shouldn't be managing other employees. The company should look to hire within and actually employ someone with decent people skills."
Tori B.,"Paso Robles, CA",60,26,,5.0,12/9/2015,"I've always been a lover of Cheesecake Factory, however my experience this time made me want to rave about my experience.    First off, our server was extremely friendly and very attentive! We had mentioned we wanted to order calamari, and my boyfriend and I mentioned we call them fish sticks so our daughter would eat them. When the server brought our calamari she noted that and said ""here's your order of fish sticks"", which was great that she went along with our fib (lol).    Along with our calamari we ordered two entrees, a kids meal order, two cocktails, and (of course) cheesecake. All of which was amazing, and huge servings.  I highly recommend going, especially during lunch hours. Overall, great service, delicious food, and worth your money!"
David B.,"Palm Desert, CA",0,5,,2.0,8/11/2016,"First time and last time!  We decided to finally try this restaurant and purposefully went during Happy Hour.  We were three including my wife and 10 year old daughter.  We were seated after a short wait and then informed by our waitress that Happy Hour was only in the bar area... Huh?  There were very few tables in the bar area and many in the restaurant section.  So because we were on the wrong side of the little wall separating the two sections,  we had to pay full price for apps and $2.25 more for a beer!  Seriously?  The waitress apologized and said they get a lot of complaints about it... No kidding!  Most restaurants in the Valley have a Happy Hour and it covers THE WHOLE restaurant area,  all customers,  not the chosen few.  Next time we will be going to one of these places and skipping The Cheesecake Factory and their annoying policy."
Isabel S.,"Costa Mesa, CA",79,502,174,1.0,8/10/2015,"Mid summer, around 5pm and there is maybe 3 groups of no more than four people in each group. We had our group of 5 and they quoted us 1 and half hour wait time. Mind you -the restaurant had plenty of open seating and the hostesses could care less in even TRYING to see if they can speed it up. Had this been Irvine, you would have been able to HEAR how busy it was. This is a great location with a nice view of a water fountain underneath but they clearly need to hire more waiters since that is why they didn't want to seat more people in each section."
Golan B.,"Los Angeles, CA",39,41,8,5.0,6/3/2016,"We came in a large party of 10 and were treated great. The server was friendly and professional and the food came fast. Tim, one of the managers, was very accommodating and took care of us. Thanks for a nice dinner experience."
Wendy N.,"Detroit, MI",227,192,624,4.0,5/4/2015,I went here for the first time ever back in May of 2013. I Had such a good time! A beautiful spot located at The River in Rancho mirage. What a beautiful area! This was my first time eating @ccf and it was very good! I got the Baja chicken tacos and white chicken chili both were wonderful. Service was great and restaurant was very pretty! Location beautiful!   The cheesecake I did not try sadly because I was way to full but oh my it looked so good. I contemplated taking some home but decided I'd  done enough damage to the diet that week on vacation: (   While we were there my partner noticed Hal Williams sitting kitty corner from us with his family. As Hal left he stopped by our table and said hello! Very nice down to earth guy it was a fun night
Mane S.,"Lake Balboa, CA",29,475,58,4.0,7/7/2014,Cheesecake Factory is always good regardless of location however this place has super slow service but our waitress was extremely nice and doing her best
Stephen L.,"Delta, Canada",99,43,12,5.0,10/18/2015,"Amazing service and both top quality food, and drinks.  Reasonably priced.   Both myself and my girlfriend were celebrating our first night alone in the desert, and we were unsure about the food at the Cheesecake Factory having only ever had the obvious cheesecake at another location of the same franchise.  Appetizers were on point and our main coarse also left us feeling satisfied, but not overly stuffed as you might expect from one of these big box type places.  Cheese cake was amazing, we will return!"
Romie M.,"Palm Springs, CA",153,2,3,5.0,3/29/2016,One of my favorite restaurants in the dessert. We had an amazing and an extraordinary experience thanks to our server Daniel A. He demonstrated to be fully knowledgable and professional with all it takes to be a good asset for Cheesecake Factory. I cannot wait to come back and request Daniel A. as our server again! Thank you Daniel. From your friends here at Morongo Casino.
Joni P.,"Rancho Mirage, CA",0,6,,1.0,4/5/2015,"We went at about 3pm on Sunday , there was no wait,  we decided to sit in the bar to watch the golf game. What a mistake. .. we waited 10 minutes for service , she took our drink order and we didn't see het again for 10 minutes.  When she came with our drinks, we ordered our meal.our food arrived 35 mins later and was Cold.  I looked around for our server and didn't see her, as I waited my son said if we send it back it will take another 35 mins.  IT was cold we were hungry.  The server finally came and checked on us , I was upset with the lack of service.  We having been going to this location for about 10 years and in the past few months the service has been a issue,  but this time the food was a issue as well We spent $65 dollars in was not worth it. I will not be returning anytime soon."
Randy B.,"Westlake Village, CA",4983,2338,4473,4.0,1/21/2015,"Expectations always met: great drinks and great big portions.  You can't beat it.  You know what you're going to get.  (PS.  As Yelp'ers, we like a little mystery and tend to go to boutique places) * Bread & Butter: It's free!  Amazing and usually warm, a dark bread (like squaw) and a baguette.  More please!?! * Large menu / large food: Pages and pages of selections, and always leftovers.  Each plate is 2-3 portions.  My favs: Chinese Chicken Salad, Cajun Jambalaya Pasta, Famous Factory Meatloaf, Chicken and Biscuits, Orange Chicken, Chicken Marsala and Mushrooms, and Chicken .  Ultimate favorite?  Bang Bang Chicken & Shrimp. * Great appetizers: Try the Parmesan-Garlic Cheese Bread, Avocado Eggrolls, Tex Mex Eggrolls, Ahi Carpaccio, and the Fried Calamari.  I nearly like the apps more than the food. * Cheesecake: galore!  My favs are: Carrot Cake Cheesecake, White Chocolate Raspberry Cheesecake, Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake Cheesecake , Adam's Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple Cheesecake, Snickers Bar Chunks and Cheesecake, but my absolute fav, Dutch Apple Caramel Streusel Cheesecake.  (note: I repeated the word ""Cheesecake"", because I can't get enough of it.  Cheesecake!) =========================== What makes this location unique? =========================== * Service: always nice, always well-trained. * Wonderful patio: 2 patios, 1 nicer than the other.  The nicer one faces a man-made stream/fountain. * Valet parking: not available. * The wait: Always, and expect at least 45 mins. It's worth it. * The bar: small.  Find a seat and avoid the wait."
Katie E.,"Rancho Mirage, CA",55,9,3,5.0,6/15/2016,"I'd just like to start by saying that literally everyone at this establishment is amazingly kind and attentive to it's customers. I've never had any bad service here.  Now on to what I really want to talk about! I was ordering some to go food at the bakery section and there was a very rude and loud woman with her 2 grandchildren waiting in the same location as I was but she wanted some cheese cake to go. She decided that the you g lady working wasn't hurrying up and helping me fast enough so she started going off on the poor girl and asked me what I was looking at. I replied to her ""its just cheesecake. Chill out"". And she continued to rant and rave about how she spent 100 dollars already and that her grandchildren and her have been waiting for over 15 minutes for service. This is a COMPLETE lie. They were standing there no more than 5 to 6 minutes. I'm writing this to let everyone know that this place is not a bad place even in the slightest and that poor staff member was working her butt off to get everyone taken care of not to mention she makes the cakes for the entire restaurant ! This rude lady continued on talking about how the worker wasn't working hard enough . Complete lies and bs!! I'M LETTING EVERYONE KNOW THAT OF YOUR READING THESE REVIEWS AND SEE HER VERY RUDE AND BAD REVIEWS OF HER EXPERIENCE JUST KNOW THAT SHE IS JUST A BITTER OLD LADY THAT HAS NOTHING BETTER TO DO EXCEPT PIT OTHERS DOWN. SHE MUST HAVE A TERRIBLE LIFE AND HAS OBVIOUDLY NEVER WORKED IN THE HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY! SHAME ON HER! SO IF YOU SEE HER BAD REVIEW WHILE CONSIDERING THIS FINE ESTABLISENT TO EAT PLEASE DISREGARD HER COMMENTS PLEASE. SIDE NOTE* I AM NOT ASSOCIATED OR WORK FOR THIS RESTAURANT AND WAS NOT PAID TO WRITE THIS. IM JUST A BISTANDARD AND WITNESS TO THIS TERRIBLE LADIES ACTION! SHE SHOULD NEVER BE ALLOWED BACK IN THERE !"
Sharon O.,"Rancho Mirage, CA",17,31,4,1.0,4/28/2016,"I now remember why I stopped going to this location....POOR mgt and staff who really dont connect with the guests. 5 of us came for lunch and I requested a table close to entrance  because some in the group have health issues. Host said it would be about 5 minutes.  Waited more then that when a hostess proceeded to take us all back to a booth at the farthest end of the place (across from MAC)while passing numerous empty tables. We looked at each other and I inquired why we were not seated closer and she said she wasnt told about our request. I asked if she noticed one in our group was using a cane?  I went back to the host area and asked him why we were not seated closer and did he notice one in our group was using a cane? I got that blank stare back...I asked if he was a Manager. ""No."" I asked to speak with one, waited and he arrived. Told him the situation. I didn't really get a response, (worst part was he stayed within the kiosk where his employee was ...I dont blame the host.. he was obviously not trained well)The mgr  did the typical apology and asked if we wanted to be relocated. At that point I had already lost time with my friends...We proceeded to have lunch. No visit from the Manager during our meal to apologize TO THE GROUP. Upon leaving,  the Mgr was at the entry/exit area and could not avoid us. He told me he spoke with his employee and about all the complaints he gets about their location and how the population out  here have struggles getting to location, etc.  #1...Not my problem and #2  he certainly has not been trained to focus on your guests to see if they require any special assistance. I'm happy to say our group all look well and you would not know are all under cancer treatment or are survivors. It's unfortunate though that our celebration lunch had this occurrence. I will add food was adequate but it's about the overall experience and this clearly lacked flair and flavor."
Paul H.,"La Quinta, CA",0,35,,2.0,4/26/2016,"We were seated on patio outside overlooking lake.  That was last good thing that happened.   Took 15 minutes to get a drink then two drink glasses were not clean.  Food took even longer to come at over 40 minutes!!!  Bad service, bad food, bad night.  They usually do better than that."
Stephi S.,"Huntington Beach, CA",558,282,792,2.0,8/6/2013,"What the heck is going on with the Cheesecake Factory?  I remember back in the days it was such the place to be. Now it seems everything about it is going downhill. I even tried three different times to see if I can get a better experience. It makes me very sad to post this review. But being the Yelper that I am, it's important to share. The location is beautiful; it's the highlight spot within the River at Rancho Mirage. Waterfront seating on the patio, beautiful landscaping, and trendy shops all around.  That's about all I can say that is positive. We were escorted to our table, and it looked like a few spots were missed when they wiped the table off. The floor underneath our table was full of food crumbs. Believe me, I wasn't trying to look for it, but since there was no table cloth the food crumbs on the floor were very visible. Our waters had no ice and didn't taste very refreshing.  I ordered the Well - Mannered Dirty Martini and although there was a little spillage when the waitress set my drink down, I did enjoy it along with the Blue Cheese stuffed Olives that came with it. For appetizers, we had the Avocado Eggrolls and felt like they were bland. Even the Cilantro sauce seemed a little dull? We tried the Factory Burrito Grande and we were very disappointed. The burrito looked like it was sitting under a heat lamp way too long, the ends looked dehydrated and overall unappealing.  Inside there was very little meat and too much dried out rice. At this point we were too discouraged to even want to try the Cheescake, which was a huge disappointment. Overall WAAYY expensive for the quality of food and the dining experience we received.  In my humble opinion, the Cheesecake Factory has some high management issues and lost their strive to be the excellent dining establishment they once were.  I doubt I will ever go back to The Cheesecake Factory again.   :-("
C M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,10,,4.0,11/10/2016,"Great selections. My fave go-to is the shrimp scampi. Pricey but well worth it! And their brown wheat bread- yummmm! They sometimes serve it with very cold butter and can make it hard to spread. They should consider serving butter in a small container, instead of having customers unwrap the squared ones. Definitely inconvenient."
Arieh T.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,13,21,1.0,7/15/2015,There are to manny flies in your dinner and drinks the manager is care less of his job. We told the manager about the situation and he was care less about it we told him we could of got sick he said that will not be his fault we told him if the health inspector came what would he do he was care less I think the manager name was Tim I forgot worst manager in the world and worst experience ever run away spend your money else were unless if you want flies in your dinner
Shauna N.,"Hawthorne, CA",67,221,248,4.0,2/12/2015,Cheese cake!!! I haven't been to cheese cake factory in forever. This location was nice. I decided to try something new Jamaican blackened shrimp! The shrimp was very good and full of flavor. The sides however were cold. The waiter was very helpful and warned it up for me. He apologized and brought me a small salad. I would order it again.
Marc M.,"Simi Valley, CA",165,48,24,4.0,7/7/2015,Food here was pretty good. Loved the atmosphere. It was really crowded and really noisy. Great place to bring children since its loud. Overall good meal and good service.
Debbie S.,"Beaumont, CA",49,16,,5.0,3/12/2016,"Myself, pregnant daughter and toddler went to dinner here on Wednesday. We expected to wait, but with a starving toddler and voraciously hungry pregnant mother i prayed it wouldn't be too long. We were seated and my granddaughter was wimpering, possible meltdown coming. The hostess or manager that seated us asked how we were asked my grandbaby whe she had a sour face and I responded, she is STARVING! She said not to worry, she could bring a baby plate of bananas and bread. My daughter and I  said YES PLEASE! This gesture saved other patrons from potentially having to listen to a cranky baby. I didn't get her name. But I  would like to thank the pretty blond lady, approx 25-30 yrs old wears hair up in a clip. We eat out often and no place has offered that. Thank you#"
