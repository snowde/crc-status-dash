Leese V.,"Northridge, CA",23,147,91,1.0,7/12/2013,"We were just at this CC location on July 10th since we wanted to have a nice dinner during our stay in Palm Desert. My daughter and niece were looking forward to eating here since it is one of their faves. A big mistake it was for us.....my daughter who order what she usually does (at the CC in Sherman Oaks) chicken alfredo got very sick in the middle of the night at our hotel. She ran to the bathroom just in time as she vomited profusely! Poor thing she kept saying it was the pasta mommy!!  We should have took the hint when we first entered the restaurant and exited. When we noticed the restaurant was not busy and had to wait a long time to be seated. The hostesses were not very friendly either. But we were really looking forward to dining here as stated above my daughter and niece love The Cheesecake Factor....just not the one in Rancho Mirage. I happen to tweet about our experience and the CC replied back right away and wanted to speak to me over the telephone so I may voice our concerns, etc. I then sent them a DM and gave them my contact info. Today the corporate office called me however I missed the phone call. I then called them back and as of this writing I have not heard back from corporate office. Even though we enjoy dining at The Cheesecake Factory it will be a long time before we dine there again. My teen daughter does not want to see another bowl of chicken alfredo or the CC again. Can't blame her. I know we will not be going to this location ever again. There are a lot of restaurants in the area and on The River check them out I know we will when we are visiting the area again."
Melanie L.,"Cathedral City, CA",7,26,3,5.0,11/28/2015,"My friend and I came to the Cheesecake factory last night after a looong day of Black Friday shopping. What a perfect choice! They have a big menu so you can find something for whatever mood your in! My friend got the Chicken Piccata which looked amazing! I got the Chicken Costelletta which was a perfect choice! Our server Joe was so nice, and accommodating! He got our food out very fast which was nice because after looking at the menu we definitely worked up an appetite! Definitely give this place a shot I've never been disappointed with anything I've ordered here their food is amazing!"
Ron E.,"Rancho Mirage, CA",61,1,,1.0,4/16/2016,Each time I have came to this place I've had bad service. Today my glass of water had lipstick still on it. I won't be visiting again anytime soon.
Pattie B.,"South Lake Tahoe, CA",0,29,1,3.0,3/19/2016,"Food was great-server was wonderful, but the wait was ridiculous. Took 30 minutes to get a table when several were empty. 20 minutes to order and 40 minutes to get our food. Don't go here if you are pressed for time, not worth it!"
Dulce T.,"Cathedral City, CA",2,37,76,5.0,4/25/2015,I love the food here!! You get a great variety of choices and the ambiance is very live..the strawberry cheesecake was wonderful!! I don't like the wait but it's so worth it!!
Mrs C.,"Murrieta, CA",0,152,28,1.0,8/12/2016,"After our last visit here, I was contacted by the manager who apologized for our experience and sent us a gift card to use towards our next meal. Well, we didn't go back until a couple of weeks ago. Wish we hadn't. At first, our server was great, she made individual recommendations for our cheesecake and she was very friendly. She brought out our desserts and then never came back to our table. When we finally managed to get her attention and ask for the check, she seemed bothered and just said ""yeah"". When she brought the check, she kind of just tossed it on our table and when she picked it up, she slid it off the table and didn't say a word. Who knows what her deal was but it was enough to have us all agree that it was time to end this little yearly tradition of having cheesecake at The Cheesecake Factory when we are in the desert area."
Lorilynn R.,"Palm Desert, CA",1030,327,198,4.0,11/2/2015,"So I was alone this evening and hate sitting at a Table alone so I sit at the bar.  Two seats between me and a guy at the end... Guy comes in and I move my purse off my chair!  He looks at me and I smile ""just giving You a choice to sit by whoever you want, pick your side!""  He laughs and tells me I'm cute!! Duh!!  Haha!  So we strike up a conversation and I find that he has done All sounds for Crimson Tide all Jerry Bruckheimer films and Tony ??? Films!  He's even done things for Spielberg so very interesting conversation!  I fell in love when he thought I was 27-28 and when he nearly fell out of his chair when he found I was a grandma of 12!!. Great to meet You Richard!"
Kelsey M.,"New York, NY",261,76,353,4.0,12/25/2014,"Like any other Cheesecake Factory, their menu is huge. Service is fast, staff is nice and quick.  Great for large parties and its a great location for tourists"
Gus L.,"Escondido, CA",247,888,771,4.0,5/2/2011,"Pretty straight forward as Cheesecake Factories go but a welcome respite when toting around an unconscious 2 year old in the desert sun. You can always count on Cheesecake factory to be a winner, especially when bringing desserts to share back to your ""base camp"". The menu is expansive and more pages than most books I have read, and with more pictures! I got the Cuban sandwich with a side salad and I was so regrettably unable to finish it, but it was SO GOOD. My wife got an individual sized pizza that was loaded with very premium appearing toppings and the cheesecakes are of course almost literly the ""icing on the cake"". I gotta say also that the service here was attentive and quick, and very accommodating to the sleeping little one that we had with us. A+ guys! Keep it up!"
Mitchell A.,"Los Angeles, CA",7,117,3,1.0,2/7/2015,"Depends how you view things but again over priced. No salad is worth $18 gosh for that amount I could feed 50 rabbits. Pies, cake factor again I just don't see how it's worth $6.. any good pie establishment $3 max. The cost in making a pie or a cheesecake varies from .75 to $4 meaning at $6 a slice it's over priced by 10 times. Yes restaurant's are there to make money but at the point of gouging no thanks. Over priced Cheesecake Factory!"
Daniel D.,"Santa Monica, CA",14,24,,4.0,6/19/2015,"The cheesecakes are top-notch here. I love getting the classic cheesecake as nothing really compares to the simple, luscious nature of the cream cheese and graham crust. Though, the more exotic flavor combinations here literally will please anyone! It's on the expensive, in my opinion, per slice so definitely a splurge!"
Taylor D.,"Boise, ID",424,131,37,3.0,7/3/2014,"I usually enjoy The Cheesecake Factory restaurant chain, but this one is far from special. The food is consistent and tastes great, but if you're big on customer service, you may want to go elsewhere. The place seems to be understaffed, simply put. The quality of service when it arrives occasionally is good.  The restaurant looks amazing from the outside, and the inside is nice as well. Great desserts, poor service, consistent food, loud and great patio seating at night."
Grace P.,"Hawthorne, CA",46,40,67,4.0,11/24/2014,"My 1st time here was not the best, but  I gave it another opportunity and it was great it really makes a big difference if your server is friendly and on the ball. I'm looking forward to going again."
Jessica V.,"Palm Desert, CA",411,70,203,3.0,12/6/2014,The restaurant is really nice. We got seated pretty quick. Saw sone friends dining so that was really nice.  My chicken pasta dish was pretty good. A little rich and the portion was huge. I know what I'm having for lunch tomorrow. Leftovers. The chicken and biscuits that my son ordered was not his favorite. He said biscuit smelled funny and was a bit soggy. He only ate the chicken didn't touch anything else on his plate. I hope we have better luck next time. Oreo cheesecake was bomb soooo good. The manager was kind enough to give a piece since we were not satisfied with the chicken dish.
Sandy K.,"Whittier, CA",3003,1575,9402,3.0,1/20/2011,"It was a beautiful day in the low desert so I dined on the patio. I arrived before before noon so there was plenty of seating.  My order Renee's combo which included a green salad, half a turkey sandwich and a bowl of soup. I washed it all down with ice cold tropical ice tea. The soup was similar to tortilla soup which was tasty, salad good and turkey sandwich was OK but lacked some flavor. I added mustard which really helped out.  Overall service was friendly and prompt and the food was good, I guess when you try to eat healthy you sacrifice taste unfortunately. Maybe next time I'll order a burger & fries or maybe Cajun Jambalaya!"
Movinonup T.,"Los Angeles, CA",23,53,3,1.0,12/26/2015,"Cold food, waited 40 min to get order, and never got a refill on ice tea. Not sure if this is all cheesecake factories or just this knew, but very disappointing. My wife finished her entire meal before I even got mine."
Ryan-Sum Dum Gai- S.,"San Marcos, CA",39,335,170,3.0,7/20/2014,"Typical chain Cheesecake Factory experience. Our server and her team were on it; glasses never empty, etc.  The atypical thing was at least three tables near us complained that they didn't like their entree. The manager came over and comped the entree and offered them a free dessert. Coincidence or people angling for free food?"
Neel j.,"Redondo Beach, CA",3,97,2,5.0,11/18/2015,"I have been going here for 5 years. The menu is great, food is very consistent , nice portions, staff is wonderfull specially, Oscar, Andrada and Hawai'in Lisa. The staff is very knowledgeable about the menu. I have eaten at all the restaurants in the Desert and the Cheesecake Factory is amongst the select few that I pick on a regular basis to eat at."
Charlene E.,"Placentia, CA",44,274,47,5.0,6/24/2015,"I'm not even going to bother reviewing the food...it's Cheesecake Factory, everything was good and the cheesecake was fantastic.  My 5 star rating is actually for our server, Adam.  He was just great in every way...friendly, funny, a tiny bit sarcastic, got everything right and was beyond helpful.  He even found that  perfect balance between checking up on us and leaving us alone.  I'm sure that at times, his job really sucks but he never showed it, lol.  Thanks Adam, and we'll be back!"
Adrienne L.,"Pomona, CA",1,17,,1.0,5/14/2014,"I was on vacation and that's when you want everything to be perfect, especially for the Money $$$ spent. Disappointed on the terrible service.  The bread was not fresh so we asked for fresh bread and the Bimbo waitress brought bread that was equally as cold and hard.  She said, ""I can't seem to get fresh bread from the kitchen."" My food had a sauce on it, and it was saturated in sauce and it made my plate mushy and overly wet.  There is a certain type of expectation that comes with a high-end entity like Cheese Cake Factory, yet our waitress seemed so sub-par.  She was a bit on the ghetto side.  Sort of Kmart-ish.  Bad, bad experience.  I will never go back to that location."
