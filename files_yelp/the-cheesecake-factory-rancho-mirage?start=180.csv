Katie ..,"Palm Desert, CA",0,6,2,4.0,1/16/2016,"Cheesecake Factory? More like Money Factory! This place was booming! The servers are nice, (well most of them.) they have small conversations with you! It's a great place. I'm coming back to you, Vanilla Bean Cake!"
Jazz C.,"Palm Springs, CA",20,56,19,4.0,9/30/2015,Great customer service! From the moment we got sat I could tell our server already had 2 large parties and a couple of smaller tables but he did great with his time management and managed to give us a great experience and fast service! 2 stars go to our server and 2 of the stars for the dessert (Oreo cookie cheesecake)! The dish I ordered here was the chicken Marsala and it tasted like dry pasta and a regular grilled chicken. Absolutely bland and tasteless. Maybe I should come back and try a different dish. But for now the food gets 0 stars from me!
Figaro A.,"Torrance, CA",25,336,190,4.0,3/15/2013,"Went to a Palm Desert country club last weekend and friends suggested coming here for dinner.  OK- I'm a teetotaler but my spirits-loving friends swear by the martinis at THIS Cheesecake Factory.  I got a Coke myself (regular of course, none of that diet fake sugar stuff).  We got a chicken marsala (very good), cajun jambalaya pasta (not bad but could be more spicy), avocado eggrolls (mmm-mm), original strawberry cheesecake (yumm-O!)   This must be the swankiest Cheesecake Factory I've ever seen...palacial and upscale, and yet very laid back with a Mariachi band playing downstairs.  The service was friendly, attentive and overall excellent... very different than snobby El-Lay!   I think I'd like to retire in PS...  :)"
Justin K.,"Oak Park, CA",4,81,,1.0,4/24/2014,Have been going to Cheesecake Factory for 20+ years This one is hands down the worst went for lunch on a Monday around 2:30 Told there was a wait for the unfriendly hostess even though the restaurant was empty Finally got seated  Server was ok - place was understaffed Food took awhile  No one cleared our tables before serving dessert and coffee avoid this location!
Mitch G.,"Palm Springs, CA",0,37,,4.0,2/25/2015,"Well, what can be said about The Cheesecake Factory that hasn't been already said. Great food, Great atmosphere, and good customer service. The menu Itself is sensory overload as it is about 20 pages long. But that is a minor criticism. Everyting I've ordered here has been delicious, and the portions are large. The place is great for large groups, which I come here quite often with many others. The cheesecakes are very good, if you have room for it after eating a huge amount of food. But, hey, you can take it home and scarf it down there! The pumpkin cheesecake is my favorite."
Eric L.,"Crestline, CA",0,7,6,4.0,11/21/2014,This was my first visit and I have to say we had a great time. The service was great the food was on point. My only complaint could be the wait it was a Wednesday night and we had to wait for a table for 5 for about a half an hour. I will defiantly go back.
Nathan I.,"Boynton Beach, FL",6,69,,4.0,9/15/2014,"Three of us visited this Cheesecake Factory for a leisurely lunch one Wednesday afternoon. My wife ordered the Chicken Pot Stickers, which are oriental dumplings, pan-fried in the classic tradition, served with soy-ginger sesame sauce. They were delicious. My granddaughter ordered one of her favorites, the Crusted Chicken Romano. This is a chicken breast that is coated with a romano-parmesan cheese crust. It is served with pasta in a light tomato sauce. My granddaughter was pleased with her selection. I ordered the Blackened Chicken Sandwich, which is a grilled chicken breast with melted fontina cheese, lettuce, tomato, red onion and spicy mayonnaise. This was very good. While waiting for our food, we enjoyed the fresh Whole Wheat and Sour Dough Breads. Following the main courses, we shared a yummy Banana Cream Cheesecake."
Mike H.,"Los Angeles, CA",17,6,3,4.0,11/18/2014,"Just had dinner here for my birthday. I have eaten here before and have never been disappointed. This time was no different. The food was great, and I can't say enough good things about our waitress, she was excellent. They have a huge selection of cheese cakes, hence the name. I recommend the Banana Cream. I do have one complaint which kept me from giving the fifth star. They didn't do a very good job of picking up the tables around us, after people had left. Other than that, no other complaints."
Miguel R.,"Los Angeles, CA",643,894,860,2.0,6/29/2012,"Of all the Cheesecake Factory's I have been to this has been the worst. Or should I say ""Che Factory"" in the case of this one. The sign was partially burnt out so this one seems to be a factory that sells Che Guevara memorabilia or something like that haha! The place seems to be smaller than better Cheescake Factory locations. I don't really like their pseudo Egyptian decor. I made the big, big, BIG mistake of ordering the Chinese Chicken Salad. It is HUGE! It is literally a mountain of food. It's a big whopping Mt San Jacinto of food. Imagine someone's girlfriend asking for this, trying to show she has a dainty appetite, and then looking like a PIG! Ugh! It is literally a foot high and is topped with crispy white rice noodles. Just try to find the chicken without making a mess! The plum sauce they use on it is too sweet after a while. I don't think I was even able to finish one third of this gargantuan meal. My BF did not like his Chicken Alfredo. CHIVAmiga, my BF and I did enjoy our shared Banana Cream Cheesecake though! Service was ponderously slow!  This Cheesecake is in a major mall so parking is no problem."
Adan Y.,"Indio, CA",8,15,,4.0,6/1/2015,"Had a great time with the family. All nine of us went there yesterday, beating the post graduation rush for lunch. Our server was great. Made sure all of us were taken care of and happy. I honk we all ordered off of the lunch menu because our bill was only $113. That's not bad for a table of nine. Not bad at all. My BBQ pizza was great and the garlic ranch dressing I got on the side was outstanding. Never had anything like it. I will definitely be heading back there soon."
Ronaldo H.,"Los Angeles, CA",113,64,13,4.0,7/13/2015,Your average cheesecake experience. Friendly and helpful staff and decent food. This one has a nice outdoor seating area over the fountain which was nice.
Lexi D.,"Moorpark, CA",0,10,,1.0,7/1/2016,"Don't say you take reservations then have the host treat you like an idiot when you call and ask to make a reservation.... So before you waste your time calling and getting scoffed at, they actually don't take reservations...."
Jacquelyn R.,"Palm Desert, CA",0,3,,4.0,7/23/2016,wish I could eat at The Cheesecake Factory everyday. Their food is exquisite. Personally I love their basket bread. I always ask for more and they always say yes and are actually nice about it. The staff is pretty nice too and will help you if need be. The wait can be long but it's okay most of the time.
Sandy S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,170,,1.0,6/21/2015,"This review is for horrendous customer service. The food here is fine, nothing special. It's a Cheesecake Factory. Go for the desserts. Evan our server was very nice, but did nothing to quiet the screeching baby at the next table. Yes, it's a family restaurant, but toddlers should be in bed at 8:30 at night. They become cranky and tired. I then asked for the manager, since my head was now throbbing. He said, we're busy, I can't move you. Deal with it. Hello??! Was he asleep during management training? His name was Tim. How about throwing in a piece of cheesecake?? I'm spending a lot of money already. Make me happy."
Amy A.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,50,,4.0,5/31/2015,Atmosphere of The Cheesecake Factory in Rancho Mirage is better than The Glove location. Less people & less hustle. Generous portion in foods as always. Don't forget to eat cheesecake.
Christina M.,"Desert Hot Springs, CA",0,48,17,1.0,3/18/2016,"I've been coming here since I was very young. My parents anniversary, my graduation, special occasions, and now my anniversary. I have NEVER had a bad experience till tonight. My server was a tall Caucasian bald man with a long beard. He came to our table once to ask what we wanted to eat. Had to ask other waitresses for assistance, because our waiter was no where to be seen. (It was not busy, even the hostess mentioned that they had been slower than previous days) There was 4 of us and never asked if we were splitting checks.. So when our bill came he was upset with a very irritated look on his face when he finds out that we have to split the check 3 ways. We asked for a box and he put it on TOP of our plate that was full of food.. That led to the bottom of the box being drenched in spaghetti sauce. Not once did he say ""have a good night"" ""thanks for coming"" etc. worst service I've had here. I left so upset."
Martin R.,"Diamond Bar, CA",341,31,6,3.0,8/1/2015,"In my opinion the cheesecake factory is far too overrated. Our waitress was a Ninja!! I say that because she would never be seen so you can actually tell her or ask for anything but as soon as you said you wanted something -- BOOM!! She was there within like two seconds asking if you wanted to thing you just said to yourself. She never really let you know that she was paying attention to you because she would just turn her back as you were asking for something! She did seem to have a very pleasant personality but what killed it was the fact that it seemed that she didn't pay any attention to you. Which is horrible customer service actually.. In her defense she did bring you what you wanted although she never actually spoke to you or said things like ""oh you're welcome"" or, ""OK cool! Coming right up!"" Not even acknowledge that you said something and she heard you. .. Her name was Wendy btw. With regards to the food, I got the shrimp and Diane steak which was good. However there was way too much garlic on the shrimp, which for a garlic lover, was far too overwhelming! The steak was pretty good albeit small pieces it too had strong pieces of garlic in it.. I did like the mushrooms however. One member of our party wanted lasagna and for an American establishment you would think that they would have this. However no, they did not. They had everything else except lasagna. It's kind of hard to understand why they would not have such a simple thing. Does it take too long to cook lasagna!? We were confused. The birthday treat that they gave our family member was a joke. Basically they have a little cup which they put Hershey's syrup on the bottom, then filled it with whip cream..  and put a candle on it. You would think that a place called ""the cheesecake factory"" could spare half a slice of cheesecake for your birthday.. but did they? No, they did not!  Instead they give you a little cup of whipped cream with sprinkles on it! LoL Overall they were nice & courteous, not rude at all. It just wasn't the best type of service that you would expect from a place like that. I must say I would not advise you NOT to try it for yourself. However I do say that I would not go in with any high expectations. The only reason I would ever return was if there was a company convention in Palm Springs and this was the place that they chose for an after event. Or if a birthday party was scheduled there. But as a restaurant to eat at just because I was hungry.. I would not go back."
Christopher H.,"University District, Seattle, WA",66,15,18,5.0,9/4/2015,"In the past I have been there and felt intimated by the daunting menu, and overwhelmed by the choices. I recently went there and was helped by an amazing served. Shanna was very knowledgable in describing the menu in great detail and helped me choose some amazing options. The avocado egg rolls were epic, the miso salmon was crazy good, and the mango key lime cheesecake was heavenly. The food and atmosphere was fun but it was Shanna who made the night amazing with her positive attitude and sweet demeanor."
A C.,"San Marcos, CA",10,71,55,5.0,8/30/2014,"Went here with a party of 4.  Yummy cheesecakes for one thing then service is great!  Stacy is amazing, funny and so friendly! I also tried their Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp and I enjoyed it so much!"
Elizabeth T.,"Santa Ana, CA",4,15,4,2.0,4/3/2015,"This is probably one of the worst experiences I've ever had at a Cheesecake Factory or any restaurant for that matter. Our server, Lisa, was just flat out rude the whole time. Even when she was trying to fake a smile, it was obvious that she either hated her job, or hated us. She was just rude to the wrong group of people, all four of us are in the customer service business so we know how to fake it to make it. The least she could have done was be nice to us the short amount of time we were there. Anyway, I would give one star because of her poor attitude, but I bumped it up to two since the food was good. Other than that, I know to steer clear of her if I ever come back to this location."
