Megan J.,"Temecula, CA",243,512,139,3.0,8/8/2013,"You know, back in the day, Cheesecake Factory was the place to go. Now, I just think it's WAY overpriced and so many kids running around! How do these people afford to come here with 3 kids?  Hubby and I came here for a date night on a Wednesday night. We got in around 630pm and we got seated right away which was nice. One thing I did like was the hostess sat us at booth kinda away from all the kids tables so that was a plus! Server was really nice and came to our table at just the right times. Had a mojito and it was okay. I've definitely had worse. Ordered the fish n chips and I felt like there was hardly any fish inside! Just greasy breading. Bummer. But the highlight of my night was the white chocolate raspberry cheesecake. Holy cow. Yumm. I want to get that again for sure. This particular Cheesecake is in a perfect location where there are lots of stops and a movie theater nearby (great place for a date night!). Maybe this place is better later at night when the kiddos have gone to bed."
Michael S.,"San Jose, CA",84,52,12,3.0,10/4/2013,I went to the Cheesecake Factory and got seated immediately.  I had the Macaroni & Cheese Burger with French Fries.  The burger was just meh.  It was definitely nothing to write home about.  The French Fries were just as good as any other restaurant.  Then came dessert.  I had the Chocolate Raspberry Truffle.  It was simply scrumptious with the perfect fusion of chocolate and raspberry.  I couldn't get enough.  I will definitely return but just try a different entree.
Chris H.,"Denver, CO",113,694,11,4.0,9/3/2013,What can you say...it's a Cheesecake Factory just like any other Cheesecake Factory. The food is almost always very good. Service was OK and of course the desserts are exceptional.
Greg G.,"Cathedral City, CA",178,13,2,4.0,5/30/2015,"Awesome food! Great sized beer ! Service sometimes is slow and there are a lot of kids, but it is a family place. I go to this location every now and then it's a above average pick."
Michael F.,"Palm Desert, CA",0,68,1,5.0,5/28/2015,"Large portions, friendly staff and great value make this a good spot for any occasion."
Karina B.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,6,6,1.0,7/15/2015,"Flys are everywhere .... Think before you come :( btw, manager is aware of the problem ,but there is nothing that he can do. Disgusting!!!"
Jocelyn P.,"San Pedro, CA",1,12,7,4.0,3/31/2015,"Our waiter Joseph was awesome!  He took care if our girls order first, continued to make sure our meal and everything was ok. Overall, food and service was outstanding!"
Leslie D.,"Monterey, CA",355,68,49,5.0,1/16/2015,"Great location, service and food. We had a large group and they accommodated us perfectly."
Valentino C.,"Banning, CA",19,2,,5.0,6/19/2015,Food was amazing and our server Lisa T was absolutely wonderful and a complete delight. Best service I've had in ages. Thanks for making dinner such q wonderful experience
Nickon B.,"Los Angeles, CA",275,13,,5.0,6/16/2015,"Came in late and they still treated me with respect. Loved our waitress, she was at the table whenever we needed her and gave great explanations of their food items, but sadly i forgot to ask for her name. They also have a beautiful patio that is above the water, so it's great for a date ;)."
Michael M.,"San Luis Obispo, CA",263,17,19,5.0,4/24/2015,Sat at the bar and started dinner off with a Flying Gorilla spiked milkshake. It was really really tasty especially with the Godiva chocolate. Next we had the calamari and Tex mex egg rolls for appetizers while watching the Clippers choke against the Spurs. Finally ordered the chicken Madeira as the main course and it was extremely tasty and great portion size. I didn't have room for the cheesecake but maybe next time. Last time I went to a Cheesecake Factory was in downtown Chicago in 1995 and it was just as good then as it is now.
Steven V.,"Surrey, Canada",25,113,50,5.0,4/24/2013,"Every time we travel to the States, we have at least one meal at the Cheesecake Factory. My wife and I went to this restaurant on a movie night.  We got seated out on the patio, which overlooked a beautiful greenbelt and lagoon that was part of The River Mall. I had their world famous Meatloaf and my wife had the turkey sandwich, both meals came out promptly and were delicious.  Making our dinner choices is always the hard part, their menu is very large and we can never remember what we ordered the last time.  We finished the meal off with a couple of cheesecakes and left very satisfied with the experience. Until next time Cheesecake Factory..."
Audra R.,"Orange County, CA",530,858,157,5.0,2/24/2013,"Never thought I would give a Cheesecake Factory a 5 star review but in a word this location is spectacular.  Situated in the prime spot at the river shopping center on the water, it's the largest cheesecake factory in CA. It is reminiscent of a Vegas restaurant. I am in love with the skinnylicious menu. Healthy, flavorful food, with cheesecake portions around 400-600 per entree.  The enchiladas, artichoke, tropical chicken (?) and chick salad sandwich were all outstanding.  The veggie escabeche that came with the enchiladas was incredibly delicious and gourmet. The river is touristy but over all a great place to go eat. No clue what people are talking about with service, I've eaten there 2x in the last month and both times service was great.  I think the basic gist is don't act like an ahole tourist and you'll be good!"
Gilbert L.,"Laguna Beach, CA",1,18,,1.0,10/5/2015,Worst service ever.We were here for lunch on a Monday and the place was half empty and we waited 15 min for a table.Then the waiter came by 4 times to say he will be right back.No water or nothing.Amother 10 min and and he still would not take our order.We left.I think he might be high or something...Perhaps it's time for a new manager!
Donna R.,"Cheviot Hills, Los Angeles, CA",85,171,98,1.0,7/28/2014,"Wow! Just walked up to hostess stand and was ignored , other people were taken in front of me. I must be invisible. Won't come here again! Manager was there. She didn't see us either. Hmm..."
Kimberly R.,"La Quinta, CA",34,28,20,1.0,12/19/2014,"Stay the heck away for lunch!  Service was horrible.  Food was mediocre at best.  $115 for lunch!  Granted we had 2 drinks each, but $12 for a martinis and $8.50 for your junky house wine?  Don't bother ordering a ribeye, it's small and just okay. Mashed potatoes were salty.  Super disappointed since this place is usually good.  We won't be coming back for long time.  Not to mention the location is a barren wasteland."
Erica M.,"Palm Desert, CA",6,3,5,2.0,1/2/2015,"Over priced, mediocre food. I will give them 2 stars my over priced sangria was delicious, but definitely would not go there ever again."
P S.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,4,,2.0,1/7/2013,"I went here yesterday while visiting the Rancho Mirage area. This was one of the worst restaurant experiences I've had. I've been to Cheesecake Factory in other places and liked it, but this location gave me a bad experience. First, they sat our group in a booth, facing a window where the sun was brightly shining in our eyes. I literally had to wear my sunglasses in order to try to cope with the extreme sun, which was still not enough, I still had to cover my face with my hand. The screens for the windows were apparently up but this did nothing to shield the sunlight in any way. In addition to that, I had an extreme headache, so this bright sun in my eyes was really not helping. The waitress did not even acknowledge the sun in our eyes, nor offered to have us move to another booth.  It was not until we got our food that one of the people who served us our food apologized for the sun, yet did nothing about it.  We were stuck with the sun in our eyes for the whole meal. Second, I ordered a lemonade for a drink, and I noticed brown specs in my drink. I have no idea what it was. I managed to take some of it out with my straw, and it was just gross, I didn't even know what it was. Third, I ordered the chicken parmesan sandwhich, and while I was eating it, I noticed little fuzzies(?) or lint-like hairs, all over the bread of my sandwich. I'm not sure what it was, but I did not like seeing it on my sandwich.  Fourth, I asked for a water at the end of our meal. I was given iced water in this mug type cup. As I was drinking, I noticed a lipstick stain on the cup. That is when I had it. That just drew the line, because that it just disgusting. They didn't even wash the cup well enough, who knows what else wasn't clean. Really bad experience at this place. I will not be eating at this location again."
Arthur K.,"Glendale, CA",0,17,,5.0,8/30/2014,"It was my fourth time here. Im so amazed. The place is really beautiful, staff are very nice and friendly. They give you lot of high quality food for reasonable price. Highly recommended."
Bruce R.,"La Quinta, CA",32,124,14,3.0,4/7/2013,"Based on the large shiny menu and the success of the chain, I envisioned a model of efficiency. I was surprised. We arrived at 4:30 on a Friday, and the place was nearly empty, but the staff had trouble figuring out where to deliver the food. When our meal arrived, the confused runner needed to ask us who ordered what. A few minutes later, another runner brought another table's meal to us.  ""You had one job...."" Knowing where to take the food seems to be pretty fundamental, but they don't have that worked out here.  I would have vented at the store, rather than in Yelp, if anyone cared. No one asked how the meal was at the table or on our way out the door. The food was good."
