Kerry M.,"San Diego, CA",1,15,2,5.0,12/13/2014,"Came in at 3pm on a Saturday and we were seated straight away. The food was great, we both had pasta. The cheesecake was out of this world and i would definitely come again. What made this visit five stars though was out server Lorraine, she was really friendly, informative  and went out of her way to help us. Thank you"
Ed T.,"San Marino, CA",59,365,133,4.0,6/27/2013,"We haven't been here since the last time we were in Rancho Mirage 5 years ago and it was wonderful to be back! It was our first night in the desert and we want to go somewhere safe for comfort food . Great food ant reasonable price, what is not to love? The River is a perfect location to see a movie before or after dinner."
Mel R.,"La Jolla, CA",5,69,39,5.0,10/3/2014,"First of all Cheesecake Factory is my and fiancé favorite restaurant we absolutely love it here too the service here is always great and food is amazing and huge portions as always I always either have their Steak Diane with Herb Salmon combination or the Jamaican black pepper shrimp both dishes are Amazing!!!!!and also, enjoy their warm brown wheat bread with butter always straight from the oven."
Merete S.,"Østfold, Norway",1,4,,4.0,6/26/2015,"Great food and service. Busy night, but the waitress was kind and took her time to answer our questions! The only thing we thought was sad, was that the portions were huge. Even though we loved the food, we couldn't finnish... Took two pieces of cheescake to go. Excellent!"
Jo H.,"Temecula, CA",0,3,,1.0,1/2/2016,Terrible service!!  Sat there 45 minutes before waiter took our order then waited forever for food. Ordered well done burger and had to send it back because it was raw.  Waiter had bad attitude
Pj B.,"Imperial Beach, CA",141,277,1,4.0,12/27/2012,"This is my first trip to the Palm Desert Area, and this place made me feel like i was in SD. The Cheesecake Factory did not let me down. I am a fan of the food and of course the desserts. The service was just ok, the guy was a lil worried about the other bigger tables but he seemed to be a nice dude.  Other than that, the place is huge and placed well in the mall and had a nice view."
Jeremy Lou C.,"Costa Mesa, CA",367,113,32,2.0,7/4/2012,"It's a Cheesecake Factory- this is kind of like rating a gas station. I mean it serves it's purpose. I go here for two things and two things only: pasta davinci and tamale cakes. They've always been tasty, never a let down here. The patio is nice but it seems like it's never opened.  Also, the hostesses could use an attitude check. My friends checked in and got a pager and decided to go walk around. Well, it vibrated so we went back and said to them ""Wow, that was fast! Is our table ready already?"" and the hostess replies ""I said twenty minutes- it's only been 10.""  Well, we didn't know it vibrates when you go out of range. A simple explanation of that would've been appropriate enough."
Yvonne V.,"Palm Desert, CA",0,20,,3.0,1/19/2016,"Appetizers were not good, Food was okay, service was okay, when you spend $100  on dinner you want it to be great not just meh, I will not go back so many other good restaurants that I would rather spend my money on. Cheesecakes were pretty amazing though :)"
Deserie B.,"San Jose, CA",10,5,,2.0,9/20/2014,"I've eaten here at least 10 times in the last year. The kids I nanny love it, but seriously, I always have problems with my food. Today I ordered the Chicken Fettuccini Alfredo, and had multiple pieces of cartilage in it. It was so disgusting."
Cynthia S.,"Granada Hills, Los Angeles, CA",382,284,61,4.0,5/2/2012,"This location is absolutely beautiful! There is the beautiful water outside that you can sit by for hours and enjoy. Of course it is about 100Degrees outside so not sure if many people do that during the day. The menu is great. There is something for everyone here. I got the Teriyaki Chicken. Its served with Rice, grilled pineapple, grilled bananas. It tasted different then the one I get from the Cheesecake I normally go to. But it didn't taste bad.  Portions are very big here, which is always a plus. Got a nice cold corona on that hot day and it totally hit the spot.  Our waitress had a bit of an attitude, then she changed her shift and the nice waiter took care of us great.. by the time we were paying the attitude women came back!  I always try to save room to eat a cheesecake at the cheesecake factory!!! Darn that warm bread they bring as soon as you sit that (get it with their house balsamic vinaigrette sauce) sooooooooo goood.... anyways, STILL HAVE NOT TRIED THEIR CHEESECAKE!! Too full!"
C R.,"Aurora, CO",0,40,,4.0,1/4/2016,"Two of us went in for lunch in December a few days before Christmas.  Despite a few large parties in our area, our waiter was attentive and friendly.  My lunch salad had an off taste and the waiter replaced it immediately and sent the manager over to apologize.  They removed it from our bill and she was nice enough to take a few photos for us on our way out.  The portions are huge and prices are good.  This location is in The River and it's fun to stroll around before or after a meal.  Oddly enough, I never have the cheesecake, but I know it's good."
Mira P.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",264,268,1341,5.0,10/2/2010,"Cheesecake Factory is always one of my favorite places if you want  delicious and tasty food. The dishes at the Cheescake Factory's are always a guarantee and never a disappointment. The menu is extensive so you can go there with a meat lover, vegetarian or those who prefer a liquor liquid diet.  The Lunch specials are a bang for your buck and the happy hour menu they have from Mon-Friday 6-8pm. Great place to have a pre-drink or eat before the movies!"
Phyllis S.,"Mesa, AZ",0,3,,1.0,3/24/2014,Bad service-  crowded - omelettes tasted like rubber - bagels like cardboard -   Never again!!!
Christa L.,"Anaheim, CA",78,94,106,4.0,7/1/2014,"Always enjoy Cheesecake Factory. Although it is a chain restaurant, the food is consistent and flavorful.  Large portions, so definitely share! Love the tamale cakes, chopped salad, orange chicken and the bang bang chicken and shrimp."
Jon A.,"Pompano Beach, FL",92,36,7,4.0,7/29/2013,"I would say everything about the meal was good. Service was friendly and they were quick to responded to requests. The silverware was a little spotty and made me think if the forks were still dirty. Other then that, I would reccommend the restaurant. It's a typical Cheesecake Factory."
OC Foodie O.,"Orange, CA",6,65,1,1.0,6/29/2012,Been to many Cheesecake Factorys so I will not let yesterday's experience change my overall impression.  Average food -above average service.. except for this location.  Noticed a large cockroach on the floor which started toward our table.  Notified waiter who said that this happens sometimes and manager who apologized.  The roach went under our table and caused some commotion before it was eradicated. No offer to change our table or make our visit better.  Manager was inept and an amateur at customer service.  Managers today better pay better attention to all their customers especially the younger generations who use social media to convey their discontentment!
Abel O.,"Corona Del Mar, CA",314,241,65,3.0,1/31/2012,"It's impossible to write a consistent review for a place that is inconsistent.  I had a good burger, the Cobb salad is horrible.... I had a great BBQ salad, the fish tacos were the worst.   I give up!   I've eaten here many times.  It's a crap shoot!   They need to get a grip on the food and service.   It's a terrific location....  Cool building.  A successful, chain restaurant needs better control."
Chris M.,"Long Beach, CA",0,17,,1.0,1/28/2014,"We have eaten at this restaurant in other locations . This was the worst . Long Wait , cold food that was not fresh and no waitress comeback to check and a high bill to boot . Better off going to Elmer's down the road . At least you know the food is fresh there and will be hot  as well as better service . Too bad , the cc factory usually has good food . It also needs a kid section . Date night with kids all around is not date night . More relaxing at Denny's ."
Steven F.,"Las Vegas, NV",8,37,20,2.0,1/1/2014,The only reason this location is getting two stars is because of the food. The service here was horrible. My wife and I sat in the bar for a glass of wine and a slice of cheesecake. The ice water which we had to ask for came out first in warm glasses followed by our bill. Shortly after the bill's arrival our cheesecake came out followed by the wine five minutes later. No check back. No manager visible. Horrible experience. They obviously have no interest in service.
Sonny D.,"Woodbury, CT",0,40,14,5.0,9/22/2014,"Friends took us here and it was simply delicious.  We have a Cheesecake Factory back in Kansas City, MO and don't think I ever patronized it. Wished ida know how good it was while living there, look what I missed out on."
