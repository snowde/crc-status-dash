Mimi J.,"Bakersfield, CA",774,1295,3576,4.0,1/2/2012,"It's been years since I've been to a Cheesecake Factory restaurant, but the memories were pleasant so I was looking forward to my return visit.  The decor is simply amazing - upscale yet not intimidating, the lighting and layout (heavy on the booths) made for an intimate setting perfect for couples, families, or large gatherings of friends.   There was a bit of a wait to be seated, but then it was New Years Day and there were plenty of us waiting to sample the food and the waiting area had plenty of comfortable benches.  The hostesses and servers were pleasant, attentive, but unobtrusive.  The drink orders were quickly taken and basket after basket (after basket) of hot fresh bread - both white and dark (Squaw bread perhaps?) arrived at our table. The menu was extensive and carried a wide variety of American homestyle favorites, from grilled cheese, to burgers; from salads to pastas and meatloaf.  There is something here to please just about everyone. We started our meal with the Avocado Eggrolls much I must say were truly amazing.  Smooth and creamy on the inside and a crispy golden brown crunch on the outside.  I have always been a big fan of Avocado Eggrolls, but what made these special was the dipping sauce made from tamarind and cashew - a unique blend of flavors that made a big impression on me.  Seriously - once the eggrolls were gone, I was dipping bread into the dip so as not to waste a drop. I had the chicken enchiladas with black beans, corn salsa, and lime cilantro rice.  Wow.  I like all three of them, but it was the lime cilantro rice that really stood out. One of my friends spoke very highly about his Orange Chicken.  I didn't try it, but I could see it was comprised of large chunks of crispy battered chicken - mmmmm.. I only wish we'd saved room for dessert but - alas - it was not to be.  Next trip!!"
Nat T.,"City of Industry, CA",34,27,54,3.0,1/7/2014,"To my surprise, this town is super packed on a Tuesday night around 6pm; with a wait time of over 30 minutes. Starving like crazy, 5 Guys restaurant not helping with the starvation since all I can smell was greasy deliciousness while waiting. I couldn't have been more happy when my pager buzz me to let me know my table was ready.  My waiter was really nice but I guess due to the super prime dinner table, she did not focus on us as much as I would've liked her to. Our water cups were not refilled unless we requested for it. She rarely checked up on us. The food was quite honestly salty. My fiancé had the seafood and chicken jambalaya. It was oily and salty. I had the mac n cheese burger with fries. My fries were super cold and I wanted to complain to my waiter but she was never around and I was too hungry to wait for them to bring me new fries. My burger was cooked perfectly but again it was cold. The mac n cheese part of the hamburger was cold so it wasn't as gooey as I would like the mac and cheese to be. We had two cheesecakes: Upside down pineapple and the carrot cake cheesecake. Both was delicious but too much cake, wish it was more cheesecake!"
Nate A.,"Indio, CA",0,30,,3.0,6/26/2015,"Came for happy hour last Tuesday night and had great, small dish meals.  Excellent service and terrific value.  Had a great evening with my guests.  At least a 4 star experience.  HOWEVER, returned again this evening (Friday) around 7pm.  It was an assault on our ears and senses.  The ambient noise level was deafening and required disco level shouting to communicate across the table.  Service was still excellent and the food was better than 'good'  but we left as fast as we possibly could escape.  I assume Friday night gets the movie crowd and families, so plan accordingly. For me, Joe Shmo, tonight was a 2 star experience, at best.  Ergo, my 3 star rating."
Esmeralda M.,"Yucca Valley, CA",27,6,3,4.0,12/10/2013,My fiancée and I dine at this location about once a week we love everything we have tried we have enjoyed my all time favorite is the Moroccan Chicken super yummy! Service at times is either a hit or miss some do ignore us while others are quite attentive... I have had 3 servers completely ignore us and I couldn't help but feel race had to be the issue as they where quite attentive to the surrounding tables but all in all we go for the food and it's always delicious
Alyssa B.,"Los Angeles, CA",88,13,67,5.0,1/26/2013,"Last night I went to "" The Cheesecake Factory"" to celebrate my birthday  with my boyfriend and intimate dinner  (party of 2) our waitress was amazing and our dinner was delicious ,the only problem was that  I had no room for any dessert lol... great night....."
Hyun K.,"Cerritos, CA",0,6,,4.0,10/23/2015,"I wasn't wowed by my visit but I must say that I couldn't find anything to reasonably complain about.  The food was good, it was brought out promptly.  3 trays of the fresh bread and bananas for 5 people - maybe stay away if diabetic :P The waitress was very pleasant and followed up several times and was very kind with our kids. Prices are standard CF fare which I consider reasonable for a sit down restaurant."
Melissa H.,"Chino, CA",623,358,220,4.0,12/26/2011,"Every Cheesecake Factory restaurant looks alike.  They are known for their large booths, nice decor, and delicious food. I had the santa fe chicken salad.  The salad ingredients were okay but the salad dressing was delicious.  It put the WOW factor in the dish.  I wanted to buy a bottle of the dressing but it looked like they combine two dressing to achieve the great flavor.  One was a spicy cilantro dressing and the other was their Asian peanut dressing; together, they have an incredible spicy sweet flavor.  Yum!  Also, I like it that they now list calories in a separate menu booklet cause when you see how many calories are in some of their dishes, you look your appetite.   Their large and eclectic menu selections make them a great place to bring large groups because there is something for everyone on their extensive or massive menu."

Amanda B.,"Dothan, AL",152,24,32,4.0,7/26/2015,"We ate here last night for dinner. We waited about 10-15 minutes for a table around 4:30. By the time we sat down the wait was an hour for outside and two hours for inside. So I would come a little early to avoid waiting a long time. After we were seated, I felt like we were kind of forgotten about. After about 15 minutes of nothing, someone finally came and got our drink order and some bread. Our waiter was very nice and took great care of us. For an appetizer we ordered the stuffed mushrooms. It comes with six. They were very tasty! I got the Baja Chicken Tacos. They were fabulous! My husband got a chipotle chicken sandwich and was very pleased with his choice as well. Our 1 year old daughter got grilled chicken with mashed potatoes (SO delicious), and carrots. We got one piece of the white chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake to go. It was divine! Overall, not a bad experience. I understand they were busy, but have to give 4 stars since they forgot about us we when were first seated."
Sarah L.,"Indio, CA",42,5,,2.0,9/13/2015,"Not coming back any time soon. Server came by once, and that was when he took our order. I understand servers get slammed in their sections, especially on weekends. (I work in the restaurant industry, I understand it can be overwhelming). However, the server walked by our table numerous times and never stopped by once to check on us. My boyfriend needed a refill, and set his glass to the edge of the table to basically signal the waiter or any staff member to stop by. Never got refills or checked on. Even where I work, the servers help each other out and stop by tables if they see the guests need refills or something else. Had to ask another server for the check because at this point we just wanted to leave. The woman who cleared our table and got our check let the manager know we were unhappy. The manager, Tim, came by and was okay. We explained that this was not the first time we received crappy service. He made up some excuse which had nothing to do with what we told him about our last experience... And his only solution was to take something off the bill, but we told him to forget it. Hopefully they train their staff to work as a team and to help each other when needed."
Meesh M.,"Long Beach, CA",120,318,27,4.0,12/21/2013,"I don't think I have ever, ever had a subpar or even slightly bad experience at Cheesecake.  They have their formula - it works for them and it works for most of us who love them.  This location was no exception and I give it a thumbs up."
Kevin V.,"Ferndale, CA",1,32,5,2.0,4/16/2016,"Ate here for lunch today, and did not have the usual ""Cheesecake Factory great experience"" people usually have. Our waiter was beyond the meaning of the word slow. He completely is lacking on common waiter skills. I mean we all ordered at the same time and he apparently thought it was ""Sunday"" so he let one of the people at our table order the eggs Benedict and was informed right before everyone else's food came that they could not make that dish because it's a ""Sunday only"" item. On top of that it the 2 other people who ordered got their food orders completely wrong and had to bring spinach that was ordered with the salmon and didn't come until we almost got the check/ cheesecake and everyone else was done. VERY disappointing experience for such a great company will not be back to this specific location most likely and hope no one else has this experience again.they didn't even take the items they got wrong and made us wait for off the bill. So sad to be nickel and dimed when having beyond sub-par service"
Claudia R.,"Milford, CT",93,677,2,3.0,4/24/2012,"It was too hot to risk shoddy air conditioning at a non-chain so we came here. I didn't care for the veggie burger but the boy liked his steak coulee (?) The service was EXCELLENT, though."
Y G.,"Ventura, CA",0,33,,5.0,9/7/2015,"My husband and I love this place! But what makes it extra special is that we ask for the server Tomas every time we go. He's fantastic! He has excellent recommendations and knows the menu inside and out. He remembers all of our special requests and really makes us feel like his friends! Great customer service seems to be so rare these days, so I have to bring attention to Tomas for giving such outstanding customer service! We watch him help large groups of people and he has such a great attitude! Thanks Tomas and Cheesecake Factory for such a great experience every time we come in!"
Mariah M.,"Indio, CA",0,2,,5.0,9/6/2014,"My boyfriend and I eat here pretty regularly after going to the movies. We are always amazed with the service and the food is always delicious. Food is well worth the price we pay, and the original cheesecake to go is a must! We definitely recommend this place to all our friends and family. Too bad there are only five possible stars, they most definitely deserve more."
Cat L.,"Kailua, HI",32,32,2,2.0,5/5/2012,"I've been to a Cheesecake Factory once before and I didn't remember being bad but I regretted coming here instead of to Olive Garden. Everything is not only pricey but the food has the same taste and poor quality like that of a TGI Friday's or similar restaurant. I got the nachos and seriously, if you don't eat them within 5 minutes, they cheese turns rubbery and hard. I was disappointed because they put very little cheese on it so most of it was just tortilla chips with some sour cream, thin chunks of chicken, and guacamole. I ended up getting the burger sliders they have in the appetizer menu. I don't know if it was me or the food but they tasted disgusting and the cheese smelt rotten. I've honestly never been one to complain at a restaurant, I'm either too embarrassed or do it out of respect for the people that work. But I actually complained to my waitress and the manager stopped by and was really nice about it. She didn't charge me and offered something complimentary but I didn't take it. I must of had a poor memory of the first time I ever came to one of these restaurants since I was so excited about the cheesecake. Another let down :/ I got the original cheesecake and it's not what I expected or wanted. It has an almost bitter flavor because of the sour cream (or whatever the thin layer of cream on top of it is).  At least I got good service from the waiter and manager."
