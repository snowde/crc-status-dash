Shayna T.,"Beverly Hills, Los Angeles, CA",0,20,,1.0,5/22/2015,Honestly I've been to Cheesecake Factories all over California and this was by far the worst one I've ever been too. Our waiter was extremely rude and wouldn't accommodate us with anything. I wouldn't recommend going here with little kids unless you have a proof of ID that they're 10 years old or younger because they gave us such a hard time about ordering from the Kids Menu for my little sister. This isn't the right way to treat your customers and I can assure you that I won't ever be visiting this particular Cheesecake Factory again because I had a horrible experience at this location.
Tammy C.,"Glendale, CA",76,17,120,1.0,7/1/2011,"I am not one to be negative or extra picky but inedible is just that. I cannot even give one star to this eatery after four attempts at eating their food. I of course had to at least give one per yelps urging.  1. I have never tried their cheesecake which I will assume is like the nectar of the gods based on how many people flock to this place. I can make an amazing cheesecake for far less than $8+ a slice.  2. I have been to multiple locations and every time I have had so so service and poor food that I do not finish. I will never go again because I am not willing to spend that much money for such poor food.  3. I had a mixed drink that neither myself nor my sister who loves cheesecake factory could drink. I love alcohol and would drink any quality hard liquor on the rocks. It wasn't that it was too strong. It literally was disgusting tasting. I have never in my life not finished an alcoholic beverage, even the cheapest beer I will not waste.  Like I mentioned before many people flock to this place. I am sure they are doing something right but I am done trying to find it."
Alice L.,"Indio, CA",33,3,1,5.0,7/31/2014,"These 5 stars go to the server, Amanda. Had a wonderful dinner party for my friend's birthday and we got the best server in the restaurant! She always smiled and gave compliments and never showed any sign of stress even though we had a big group. Everyone received their correct order and the food was delicious. Had the tiramisu cheesecake. Delish! The meals were a bit pricy but we had such a wonderful time with our friends."
Selina S.,"Campbell, CA",52,307,237,3.0,6/4/2013,I love Cheesecake Factory but this location has sloppy cooks. While vacationing here in Rancho Mirage we got take out a few times. Everytime we recieved our food it was so messy and sloppy. I got the lettuce wraps and 80 percent of my chopped carots looked like a ten year old chopped them. Just complete hack work on our take out. We get take out a lot so I know what to expect. The food was alright and seasoned well.
Megan B.,"Downey, CA",1,20,,1.0,5/9/2013,"I don't even want to give them 1 star! I've been to many CCF in California and this one is by far the worst. Sat down and the seats were dirty along with food leftovers on the silverware! Ordered Chicken Piccata...tasted like a old oil with bad mayo! I'm calling cooperate...unacceptable! My waitress was nice, but her service and timing was horrible! It was empty and not crowded at all, so there's no reason for bad service. I didn't even get my Red Velvet Cheesecake cause I was so upset."
Sarah S.,"Portland, OR",90,6,1,2.0,5/7/2013,Our Server was amazing but everything else was fairly crappy. We had the pleasure of watching/listening to a very unhappy server whine and complain to the table across from us about how much she hates her job and got to watch another one basically throw a tantrum. I work in the service industry and would NEVER let any of this happen where customers could view. I will say our server (god I wish I remember her name) was AMAZING. She was hilarious and helpful and it was very apparent she had complete control of the patio. She was very aware of new tables and making sure everyone at least was acknowledged and directing the other servers as to what tables still needed helped. She managed the patio very well even though she didn't have the entire section and was sharing a section with other servers who were clearly unhappy and not wanting to work. We were there on April 14th around 2pm.
Y E.,"Indio, CA",0,22,3,4.0,4/24/2014,"I love Cheesecake Factory because they have so many different kind of food to choose from and they are all pretty good! My favorites are: Luau salad, Chicken Bellagio, Avocado Eggroll, Bistro Shrimp, Jamaican Shrimp, etc... Never had issue with their service either!"
Jesse S.,"Los Angeles, CA",130,111,31,5.0,1/19/2015,"If you know the Cheesecake Factory, you know to expect excellent service and a stunning amount of delicious food to choose from. That's exactly what we got from this location. We went twice within twenty four hours and it was excellent each time. Cheesecakes, obviously, are to die for but our food was so tasty. They can't do wrong here."
Dino T.,"Cerritos, CA",0,33,41,5.0,1/19/2015,Love this restaurant. Has in my opinion best pizza around. Got there everything pizza with extra mozzarella it was unbelievable.  Everything is delicious here but try there pizza won't be disappointed.
kami A.,"Brentwood, CA",86,38,11,5.0,4/12/2009,"Cheesecake factory always has the best service and great quality food. You could never go wrong for big groups, since everyone can get what ever they're in the mood for."
Fred B.,"Glendale, CA",507,122,,4.0,9/8/2011,"The menu is so large that you can't go wrong.  Even if you hate 150 dishes, there are still another 320 to try before the well runs dry at cheesecake. Needless to say, we go often!"
Veronica D.,"Oceanside, CA",75,93,159,4.0,10/15/2013,"The Cheesecake Factory has not disappointed me yet. When greeted we asked for a patio table and were seated without a wait. It was a sunny day but they have many umbrellas outside they were happy to move for us to provide ample shade. Our waiter was friendly and provided attentive service. The Mai Tai was a tall size, just like the size of my side Cesar Salad, more like a full salad....The lunch special came with half a sandwich, salad and a hearty portion of soup. More than enough to share. We snacked on an array of appetizers, the fried avocado with aioli dipping sauces was a favorite of mine. The restaurant was very clean and paying the bill was a quick process."
Brenner C.,"Cathedral City, CA",0,9,2,5.0,3/13/2015,Amazing food and outstanding service as always. I HIGHLY recommend to request to sit in Amanda's section for she is hands down the BEST server every single time. She is extremely friendly and is able to answer any and all questions. It's the amazing servers like her that make us return time and time again !
Hollie S.,"Palm Desert, CA",91,50,4,5.0,10/31/2014,"perfection! beautiful location on a beautiful pondlike area! amazing staff, esp one girl who uses just about every pet name you can imagine when she serves you. amazing food, clean, fast- LOVE"
Allan-ester D.,"Vancouver, Canada",59,611,28,4.0,8/18/2013,"I'm a Cheesecake factory fan for many years...I keep going back and the food is consistent, excellent, and GREAT selection...the value of this restaurant is really unprecedented in America"
Rpm R.,"San Ramon, CA",829,437,,4.0,8/28/2010,"Located at ""The River"" - an outdoor shopping/dining area with a movie theatre, PF Changs, a chocolate store, Starbucks, this other restaurant that I can't remember the name of and so on- overall a nice place. I like the Cheesecake factory, even tho it's a ""chain"", I like the large menu options, the food, drinks and the overall look of it.  The staff here is very engaging, friendly and seem to like their jobs.  We ordered the Ahi Tuna Tare Tare, a Grilled Eggplant Sanwich and Fish Tacos Albacore.  All were very good, I really liked my fish tacos and the portions were huge.  We didn't have any dessert- we were too stuffed."
Eric G.,"Verdun, Canada",4,44,3,2.0,8/25/2012,"Long wait even on a Tuesday night in August. Obnoxious waitress trying too hard. Super long wait for our food 20-25 minutes at 8:30pm. No thanks, never again."
Nicole F.,"Desert Hot Springs, CA",0,8,,4.0,2/11/2014,Awesome food & great service always! Friendly staff & huge portions. Will be back for sure.....
William G.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,46,,1.0,7/1/2012,"Might be Ok, but in the summer, the walk from the parking lot to the restaurant is like the Bataan Death March."
Susan O.,"Beaumont, CA",1,33,,5.0,10/8/2012,"Just went today to the RM in Palm Desert area to celebrate our Anniversary, we had a wonderful meal. Our server was Lorraine D. H and she was so pleasant and helped with choice on the lower calorie menu. Decided on Chicken with a spicy sauce, pineapple and asparagus with tomato and rice under chicken. Husband had the Cajun pasta of course very large portions but no complains here. We eat lunch/dinner toward end of day. We took home the seasonal pumpkin & pecan cheesecake and cookie dough for later and maybe tomorrow. Very nice day in the Springs around 90 but with a gentle breeze. Movie Theater is right there for added fun. Great place you have got to try it."
