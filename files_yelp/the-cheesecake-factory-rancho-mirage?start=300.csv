Robyn T.,"Palm Desert, CA",0,18,,1.0,11/23/2015,"We ordered to go food @ 4:27pm and was standing and waiting after paying for an hour with not many people in the place! Finally the girl brings the food out and I asked if the dressing was in the bag she comes out with a bag and there was our salad. Good thing I said something or I would have gotten home and no salad! I am glad I asked since they forget the dressing that comes with the salad! I got a pasta dish with shrimp and ask for extra Parm and guess what NO Parm at all. I got the Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes and you should see the side of Cilantro I got. I would post a pic but can't see that I can. Oh, also They don't clean the shrimp at all!!!!!!! Way over priced for what happened to us tonight. I'm so disappointed. The walk for someone who has walking issues to get to the restaurant is a long walk since they don't have the service set up to bring it to your car like they do in other locations but at this point I feel sick and won't be eating there ever again!!!"
Dee D.,"Manhattan Beach, CA",50,104,53,1.0,8/8/2014,"Worst service ever, avoid the server Carolynn, she is totally clueless. Greeted us after sitting there for 10 mins with a handfull of dirty dishes, then put down one dirty cocktail napkin with sauce on it from the dirty dishes. Drinks and bread took 15mins (4 h20 & 1 diet coke) to get and ordering another 10, the appetizer we ordered never came. Each one of our meals came out one by one with a few minutes in between each. But the best was when we informed the expo we never received our appetizer, she told us it was given to another table by accident but Carolynn informed us that she forgot to put it in, with an oppps, do you still want it! Usually I am not so harsh with my reviews but service from there got even worst. When we asked to box up our appetizer and for the check, she disappeared again for another 10mins. Our whole dinner experience consisted of 45 minutes of sitting wondering if we would get service, our appetizer and when our check and boxed appetizer would get back to us.  Also what good is a manager walking the floor if she does not touch tables or even bother to come to a guests table when requested."
Emmanuel B.,"Palm Desert, CA",17,46,63,3.0,6/18/2010,"The building looks like Brescia's (an italian city) post office probably built in the 30's. Nothing bad to say about this place, nothing good either. The menu is the usual chain restaurant menu, the food is ok, the service is alright, the price a tiny bit above the average. Sounds fair since the place is cleaner than the average."
Cindy M.,"Pasadena, CA",0,190,,5.0,3/30/2013,Their service is amazing and their manager was amazing as well. She was very friendly and sweet. The food here is great compared to other cheesecake factory. They alway keep their restaurant and restrooms clean.
Natasha W.,"La Quinta, CA",37,29,15,3.0,6/18/2012,"Was ok, service was mediocre. I asked the gentlemen that brought our food if I could have some ranch, he replied with an exasperated look and said ""ok I have to go  all the way over to the kitchen"" and left."
Rae T.,"Moreno Valley, CA",271,352,708,2.0,6/16/2012,I am giving two stars just because we had excellent service. Unfortunately the food was bad. I ordered the fish n chips lunch which came in tiny overcooked nuggets. The batter was tough and drenched in oil. I ate the fries and left the fish and the bland coleslaw. Such a waste of 11.50. My friend paid for the meal so I did not feel right complaining about the meal plus I had lost my appetite anyways. As we sat and talked a bit longer we ordered cheesecake. Mine was overly sweet but my friend enjoyed his oreo cheesecake. The service was one of the best I had ever had. The server brought out a plate of fruit and bread for my son to keep him occupied while we were waiting for our food since this is one of few establishments that do not provide coloring material with the kids menus. The restaurant sits on water and the interior is typical of the other locations.
Nancy M.,"Woodburn, OR",0,5,,2.0,2/28/2014,"Ate lunch at this location today.  Both of our bread plates had dried food bits stuck to them and the silverware was greasy.  Told the waitress, she brought new plates and silverware.  Second set of silverware and one plate still had greasy film.  Poor service as well, and the hostess seated a group of four large individuals right next to us, when there were at least six empty and ready tables.  This location is the exception to most Cheesecake Factories.  We will not return."
Mike E.,"NORTH HOLLYWOOD, CA",11,21,2,5.0,11/16/2013,"This is one of my favorite cheesecake factories to go to. Great location, very friendly staff and great food.  Had the ribeye and was very happy. They also have a great light menu."
Jenna C.,"Beaufort, SC",18,30,,1.0,6/12/2012,"Beyond disappointed! Food was disgusting, including my 2 y/os child plate...she took one bite and said ""no like, momma. Yucky."" ...and she usually loves chicken. Our server was extremely slow. She even brought out our drinks in dirty mugs! We always go to Yardhouse next door, but decided to try something different. Needless to say, we won't be back! Don't waste your time or money at the Cheescake Factory!"
Bill F.,"Spring, TX",0,55,1,4.0,3/29/2012,"The rating is primarily for the dessert. I had heard good things about their dulce de leche cheesecake. It was worth the wait to get in. I had the beet and goat cheese salad, the farro salad, and the samosas. The salads were good, but looked amazingly similar. The samosas were somewhat below average."
T H.,"Rancho Mirage, CA",0,4,,5.0,10/17/2014,"I realize this is a chain, but the food is consistently great. Wether it's a simple lunch or amazing dinner. Their steak Diane is fabulous. The brown bread is my favorite. The specialty soups are always good. Drinks are pricey but there is always water."
R R.,"Oceanside, CA",0,1,,1.0,11/24/2013,"I just got off the phone for a take out order and I'm so disappointed in the lack of service I received. The hostess who answered the phone offered to put me on a brief hold in order to place my order. Does brief qualify as nearly 5 minutes? I thought i was forgotten so I hung up and called back- the hostess said they didn't forget me, they were just busy. She asked if I wanted her to go back there and make sure they pick up the phone? ( ummm isn't that expected when you place a take out order? )  she transferred me again and after a minute the line mysteriously got disconnected. At this point I gave up and called PF Changs - not what i was in the mood for but at least they are happy to take my order."
Matt D.,"Valencia, CA",23,197,21,4.0,6/29/2012,"Great service, and the same good cheesecake factory food. I was talking to my wife in the car after we left and we both agree that it's not the best food there is but for a chain it works well. She said it was a step up from an elephant bar. We really like the spicy cashew chicken."
Max F.,"Carlsbad, CA",0,24,,2.0,8/28/2013,"We used to love this place till our last visit, a complete disappointment, our waiter was never around, took him forever to take our order, and even longer to bring our food, he was wondering around and talking and not checking on us at all. When our food came, it was not that great, it was too spicy and not very flavored. Our food took so long that our kids got too tired and we left without looking at desert menu which they were looking forward to it. Very disappointing!"
Madison E.,"Palm Desert, CA",0,6,2,4.0,7/23/2014,Great food great service but most of the waiters/waitresses smell strongly of cigarette smoke.
Leonard M.,"Palm Desert, CA",49,20,13,4.0,7/29/2013,"I came here for desert after eating at Sams Sushi. We had the Velvette Cheesecake, AMAZING!!!!"
Deanann S.,"Desert Hot Springs, CA",7,9,,3.0,4/29/2013,"Our party of 5 went there on Saturday for lunch.  The service was not stellar.  One of our diners ordered the mushroom burger and when it arrived, he proceeded to put on his condiments only to discover ""grey matter"" on top of the burger.  We called the waitress over to ask what it was and she said ""cheese"".  We are used to cheese being yellow or white and gooey not gloppy.  She offered to get him another burger and we thought that would be the best idea. The rest of us proceeded with our meal, while he shared our fries.  The meal had ended for the four of us and he was still waiting for his re-fired burger.  Finally, we asked that it be packaged to go.  After a few additional the new burger appeared. What a dining mis-pleasure.  No apologies.  It appeared that we may have been more of a nuisance.  We will think twice about going back.  We would rather enjoy our dining out experience.  Besides, there are more attentive restaurants to spend our dining out dollars."
Sally L.,"Cathedral City, CA",0,9,1,5.0,8/15/2014,"Always great service, and welcoming hosts. Food is always delicious, you can't go wrong with anything on the menu! Excited to see their new menu items coming out soon"
John s.,"Ventura, CA",6,9,2,5.0,8/26/2010,"Awesome! After the yummy Black Forest Martini, That's all I can say.  :)"
SoCalSkippy ..,"Victorville, CA",0,202,28,2.0,10/24/2011,"I've been to dozens of ""Cheesecake Factories"" so I'll make this short/sweet: the service was just ok, the avocado eggrolls were awful (the avocados were rotten) the pad Thai pasta was average and the Godiva chocolate cheesecake was to die for. Basically, this particular location was very average and considering the location...I expected MUCH more! If I ever find myself back in the area again I definitely WON'T be eating here again. Head over to PF Chang's instead, it's right next door."
