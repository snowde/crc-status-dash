Jeff L.,"Woodland Hills, CA",40,235,,4.0,4/9/2012,"It was so crowded for dinner one night we came back for lunch. Nice and quiet, great service and food. Whenever I see a Cheesecake Factory, I'm heading in. This place at the River was no exception."
Steve B.,"Thompson-Nicola Regional District, Canada",0,41,,4.0,2/9/2013,Just came back from Vacation and continue to love this particular Cheesecake Factory. Service is always excellent and food as well. Very busy on weekends and nights during the busy season so be prepared to wait!!
D D.,"La Quinta, CA",0,16,,1.0,5/29/2013,"Wow, what a horrible experience I had!!! The whole family, about 20 of us, had dinner on Saturday night. I ordered a salad with chicken and was brought a salad with only a few pieces of chicken. I asked the manager to please look at my dish and the lack  of chicken served. His response was, ""Well, it does look like you have eaten some of the chicken. I saw you eating it""!!!! That is what he said, he kept arguing with me over the chicken and was soooo rude to me. I have NEVER had a manager talked to me that way. When he finally brought me the missing chicken, he asked me in a condescending way, ""IS THIS ENOUGH CHICKEN FOR YOU?"". Can you believe it. I looked at him and asked ""TO please walk away NOW"". I will NEVER go back."
Cat A.,"Plano, TX",10,120,19,4.0,1/14/2012,"I came here on a weekend stay in Palm Springs.  Ok so I am not really a chain restaurant type of girl, but The River is a nice place to go, so I decided to try it out. I haven't been to a Cheesecake Factory in over 5 years.  Anyway, this review is just for the Spinach and artichoke dip - very good!  Comes with chips and not bread which I like.  The seating was quick and the lighting is dim and relaxing, really nice atmosphere.  The place seems huge, but maybe that's how they all are?  Anyway, I wouldn't go out of my way to come here, but if you're in the area, I would recommend it."
Christyn K.,"Kansas City, MO",259,481,234,3.0,7/20/2009,"Mixed reviews. Went for our wedding anniversary - my husband hated his dish while I didn't mind mine. Of course it's a bit pricey (it's CCF + Palm Springs tourism), but the quantity of food wasn't shabby. My ""appetizer"" salad was huge and more than enough for me. My husband's salad was tasteless and had a really weird dressing on it that tasted bitter. We ended with a DELICIOUS piece of White Chocolate Macadamia Nut Caramel cheesecake - and they even added a bit of whipped cream and a candle on it for us. Can't complain....well, my husband can, and still is. Overall, it was nice to check it out, though, sadly, I don't think I will be back again, as I can spend just as much money somewhere else and get more for my buck and pallet."
F G.,"Rancho Palos Verdes, CA",0,4,,5.0,7/7/2014,"Awesome experience!  We spent the 4th of July weekend in Rancho Mirage to celebrate our mom's birthday.  We have very picky family members, so to find a place to eat that would satisfy everyone is always difficult.  Choosing this place came out of the variety of food choices they offer. We waited only10 minutes for our party of 8 to be seated.  Our server was Kathy. She immediately gave us plenty of bread,  took our drink orders and gave us dining suggestions.  She was very knowledgeable of the menu.  Our food was delicious,  our drinks were always full, and we got more warm bread than we probably needed.   The service was top notch!  Dessert time was extra special.  Kathy decorated a plate with confetti candies and chocolate sauce swirls and chocolate handwritten ""HappyBirthday!""  She had a group of servers sing HB to mom and took pictures for us.  It's was perfect.   Big thanks to Kathy for making our night more special!"
Mark K.,"Temecula, CA",95,299,200,4.0,7/26/2011,Love this place.  Great food.  Great service.  Great dessert.  Try the Farmhouse Cheeseburger... it's ridiculous!
Miguel R.,"Yucca Valley, CA",0,8,2,1.0,6/17/2014,"I had heard so much about this place. Various friends had recommended it and made it seem like it was worth it; it was, to some extent. Some friends and I visited the place to have dinner. We were greeted with a big smile and were seated almost right away. We ordered our drinks and appetizer, lettuce wraps, and they were good. Plating could have been a little neater and organized, but we dove in right away. The menu was really long, it had almost every plate imaginable, so it took us a while to decide on an actual entree. They offer sandwiches, burgers, salads, pastas, if I well recall they offer pizzas, soups, Mexican, and tons of other dishes that do not fall under the category that the place is listed as, new/traditional American.The server came once in a while and asked if we were ready, she always had a decent and jocund tone. After several minutes of deliberation we decided, I ordered BBQ Chicken Salad. When the plate arrived, I was surprised at the image before me. The plate was dead. The colors were not vibrant and vivacious as other salads I had eaten before. The lettuce was not crisp and green, instead it was yellowish, as if it had been exposed to air for a while, and it was a bit soggy. The tomatoes were a shade of light red, instead of the vivid red tomatoes usually are. The onion rings were cold, as if they had been cooked an hour or so before the salad was plated. And the chicken. Oh, that chicken. It was, in one word, bland. It had no flavor whatsoever. It tasted as frozen. Not even the BBQ sauce made up for the blandness of the whole salad. I put some salt to it and it did not fix anything. One of my friend's ordered a breaded chicken breast, and his plate also looked dead, and the chicken had, again, no flavor. HIs greens were tasteless; the only good thing on this plate were the loaded mashed potatoes. The chef has to much to deal with, the massive menu. They should cut back on so many unnecessary foods. I understand they may have a large menu to accommodate the grand variety of palettes, but it's working against them. They should focus only on two things, American food and cheesecakes, that's it. I do not intend to come back to the place anytime soon."
Amanda L.,"Beaumont, CA",1,12,,4.0,7/31/2012,"Excellent food, good speedy service. Clean inside  and out and if u sit outside u have nice view. Been here twice and each time us pleasant:)"
David P.,"Palm Springs, CA",0,83,,1.0,2/15/2013,Worst service possible. Never saw an empty Cheese Cake Factory empty on a Friday at lunchtime. Now we know why. Ridiculously bad.
Paula B.,"San Diego, CA",9,112,9,4.0,2/8/2012,Love the fact that you can get a lunch-sized portion until 5:00 PM.  Can you believe I've eaten at these places about 20 times and have never tasted their cheesecake?  What's wrong with this picture?
JJ W.,"Yorba Linda, CA",1,28,5,5.0,4/4/2012,Excellent service! Food was good but I ordered the wrong thing so I was a bit disappointed. I hate to give bad reviews unless they purposely treat me bad. I ordered a low calory entree so it was a two stars.. My fault :(- I love places where staffs would treat us with five stars service without judging us by the color of our skin.
Jackie M.,"Vancouver, Canada",852,371,537,1.0,7/14/2009,this is the worst one i've ever been to. i am a big fan of cheesecake factory but they ruined all the dishes. yuck! everything taste way different here... i do not recommend. im not the only one that thinks so either?!!!!
Tanner K.,"Anaheim, CA",0,4,,5.0,1/21/2014,I absolutely love the Cheesecake Factory. I always order the chargrilled Colette steak it is phenomenal.
Klamy F.,"Huntington Beach, CA",131,20,39,4.0,8/17/2013,"We were a party of 19 and it seemed as though no restaurant was willing to  accommodate a big group.  I tried calling various restaurants for reservations. Outback wanted to split us up into groups of 4 or 6 throughout the whole restaurant. Babe's BBQ didn't take reservations, the Yardhouse didn't take reservations and had an hour wait. PF Changs- one hour wait. Finally, we went to the Cheesecake Factory to see how long the wait would be since they did not take reservations either. To our surprise a party of 20 had just left and they were able to take us in right away.  The waitress split our bill 4 ways, she got all the orders correct (amazing, considering we were a big group). The food was amazing, as everything else I've ever tried at the Cheesecake Factory. The waitress did a good job maintaining our glasses full of cold-iced water. We really enjoyed our experience at this particular Cheesecake Factory location!"
Shawn K.,"Palm Desert, CA",0,1,,2.0,4/22/2014,"Two stars only because the server was pretty good. The food on the other hand was not. We were running late having dinner and wound up here at 8:45. My wife and I both ordered well done steaks. Both steaks came out almost an hour later and both were rare. The server took them back for more time on the fire. The steaks came back out, and still weren't well done but considering how hungry we were, we decided to eat them. I've had tough steaks a couple of times in my life but this was the first time I had a steak so tough I literally could not chew it. It was hands down the absolute worst steak I've ever had in my life. Unfortunately, that was not the only issue we had tonight. When they brought the steak back out, they also brought fresh fries but for some reason decided to use the same onion rings. And the green beans that seemed pretty decent, lost their appeal quickly, when halfway through we found a hair. Needless to say this was our first and last time at a cheesecake factory. The thing that really stinks is that by the time this played out,  all the other restaurants were closing, so there were no other meal options.  Thanks a lot cheesecake factory for ruining our last night out."
Susan S.,"Indio, CA",12,16,,4.0,5/31/2011,"I have been to this restaurant several times and left feeling like the food was ok for the price I paid. However, we went back tonight and had the Ahi Carpaccio as an appetizer and it was DELISH! We also had the Shrimp Francese and it was also delicious. The portions are large, so we split the appetizer & entree. I also learned that Cheesecake Factory now makes a ""skinny"" version of some of their cocktails (no sugar or syrup). The skinny Long Island Ice Tea was good, but like all of their cocktails it had no kick to it. The service was excellent and we even got a free anniversary dessert. I would give this restaurant 5 stars, but the drinks are WEAK. Save your money and order wine or beer. The food & service was very good."
Kristopher C.,"San Diego, CA",481,411,63,4.0,7/3/2009,"Thai Lettuce Wraps and beer, amazing Thai Lettuce Wraps and beer. Double dates. Sat in the bar area. Those wicker chairs are beasts. be careful ladies(unless you want wicker legs for a few hours). cali cheesesteak was good, esp with ranch. ceasar was kinda lacking. the beer was very cold, almost too cold, but not really, spot on cold.  foreals tho? Thai Lettuce Wraps and beer, amazing Thai Lettuce Wraps and beer!"
William F.,"Palm Desert, CA",0,8,,1.0,10/24/2012,"Got cold bread upon arrival.  Waited for waiter to return for about 25 minutes.  They sat us, then forgot about us.  Your loss cheesecake factory.  We went to Yardhouse instead and had excellent service.  Not coming here again."
Jen  Eric D.,"Rancho Mirage, CA",0,7,3,4.0,11/13/2011,Good lunch. Try the shrimp & bacon club.
