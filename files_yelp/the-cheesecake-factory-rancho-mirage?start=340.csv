Leejae-Christopher L.,"Beverly Hills, CA",312,5,2,1.0,2/15/2011,"This is the worst cheesecake factory I have ever been to. I'm from San Francisco and this location has nothing compared to SF. So, I ordered the Renee Special on A wheat baguette with chicken salad with the soup of the day and baby greens. The soup of the day was cold and congealed. They burnt the wheat baguette and they put it on turkey instead of chicken salad. Then they fixed it and instead of giving a new wheat baguette, they used the same one but flipped it like I wouldn't know. It took them 3 times to fix this. I dont understand how hard to mess up a sandwhich (c'mon now). Then, they want to look at me like I'm crazy? I think that's unprofessional and ridiculous for cheesecake's reputation."
Irene A.,"La Verne, CA",27,123,57,2.0,5/14/2011,"This review is for the service.  I'm used to the waitstaff being attentive at any of the Cheesecake Factories that I visit.  Unfortunately, I can't say that for this location.  On a Wednesday night when the restaurant was not too crowded, we experienced the worst service.  Our waitress took way too long to take our order.  She did not even check on us after our food was served.  We had to flag her down to get a dessert menu.  Of course the food was delicious, but I will not recommend this location due to the bad service."
Paisley D.,"Palm Springs, CA",41,20,2,2.0,8/14/2011,"I'm going to start off by saying that I have never been disappointed by the food in any cheesecake factory location. The Pasta DaVinci is excellent, &  when I feel like treating myself to dessert, I'm more than willing to fork over the seven or eight bucks for a slice of rich, straight-to-my-thighs cheesecake.  However, the last few times I've eaten at this particular location, the service was less than desirable. When I last ate there on Friday afternoon (around 3:30PM), the restaurant was not busy. There appeared to be more waiters than there were occupied tables, making poor service entirely inexcusable. Although we were seated quickly (by a super friendly [and attractive] host), it took about ten minutes before our waiter showed up to even take our drink order. We weren't offered bread, & had to wait another ten minutes after finally asking for it (which wouldn't be so bad if it were fresh, but nobody wants to wait for cold, stale bread). It took even longer for our waiter to get around to taking our order, though he walked right by our table several times. He rarely stopped, & when he did it was as though he were in some big hurry to move on.  I won't stop eating at this location.. it's the closest to my house & sometimes a girl just needs a slice of cheesecake.. but it would be nice to be treated with a little more hospitality next time if I am going to be spending $20+ for lunch."
Misse D.,"Chicago, IL",377,591,3,2.0,1/21/2009,"By far, my worst Cheesecake experience. I came here with my husband and his parents.  We grabbed a pager and were told a 25-40 minute wait.  Soon after, a table at the bar was found.  When we sat down, there were the dishes from the previous customers.  It took close to 10 minutes for our table to be cleared.  When the waitress came up, she asked us what we wanted to drink.  Since there was still the dirty dishes and no menus, I asked for a menu.   I won't go into a play by play of the night.  Suffice to say, that the service was mediocre at best.  The food was good.  However, I didn't walk away with the satisfied feeling I usually get from The Factory."
Jim B.,"Claremont, CA",35,27,2,1.0,12/6/2010,"Our server was so rude...got the surf and turf...biggest portion on the plate was the mashed potatoes that were almost cold. My wife got the crusted ahi and it just came in a huge bloack, no flavor on a bed of almost cold rice.  Best part of the meal were the martinis...everytime I have gone here over the past 10 years it has gotten worse...I should listen to my friends."
Trey C.,"Oakland, CA",218,134,10,2.0,6/9/2008,"Nothing is worse than showing up at 5:30 to a mediocre restaurant and waiting 40 minutes for a table. Welcome to the Cheesecake Factory in Rancho Mirage. I want to scream at everyone else waiting, ""Why are you all here? Don't you know the food's not that good?!"" But, you know, I guess I'm one of those people. It's not my fault though - I was visiting family and they wanted to go. The Coachella Valley (basically Palm Springs to Indio if you're not familiar) didn't used to be like this. About 15 years ago it was a pleasant mix of local flavors and national chains, developed neighborhoods and open spaces. Now it's importing big quantity-over-quality chains as fast as possible and becoming an eyesore of strip malls and traffic. Cheesecake Factory is a good symbol for that evolution. Two stars for the restaurant and two stars for the entire Coachella Valley."
Heather B.,"La Habra, CA",90,361,12,4.0,2/20/2011,"I really like this location. When in Palm Springs, this is the closest location. I like the shopping center it's located in and how the restaurant sits above the man-made lake. On a nice, not too hot desert day, sit outside on the patio for a nice, relaxing meal."
Ashlyn S.,"Rancho Mirage, CA",1,1,,3.0,2/20/2012,"I went to the Cheesecake Factory for a valentines date with my boyfriend. As we sat down we didn't have silverware, so a man grabbed some from the back. I noticed right away the silverware felt greasy and my boyfriend had white food on his fork and spoon. We were both grossed out and we returned the silverware to our waiter. He didn't apologize and he seemed mad that we returned the silverware.  When we got our water glasses mine was covered in white goo. Gross! When our waiter went to take our orders he seemed rude. He was making remarks about what I wanted to order. The four cheese pasta, without chicken. He seemed mad I didn't order chicken. I wonder why? My boyfriend didn't like how he was acting to me so he ordered chicken enchIladas WITH chicken. With emphasis on the chicken. The waiter picked up on his sarcasm and seemed to relax. He was nice from then on. No problems after that at all. the food was good and the cheesecake was excellent. My only other comment is that three waiters walking by dropped three glasses or plates. It didn't bother me thought."
bob m.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,10,,4.0,1/28/2015,"We have come many times, but not to this restaurant...it's at The River and it's really nice outside...the inside is standard stuff, but very nice as they all are.  I think the food is very consistent across the chain, so you really can't go wrong.  I tried something different this time...Chicken Bellagio...WOW...really good!  Nice quality of chicken, lightly breaded, nice pesto pasta, tasty arugula and...and...a large slice of prosciutto!?  Super tasty!!  Others had catfish, mac n cheese, orange chicken...all great!  Cheesecake...I'm sorta funny about this...I like it to be creamy/fluffy and some of them seem too dry...like they've been around a few days.  I had the 30th anniversary edition and it was good, not great.  Try the strawberry shortcake says my daughters..it looked good.  Great service from Lisa T.!!  She needs an award for keeping our drinks filled and being attentive overall.  Everyone had a good time and the food overall was great...nice job to the management team for keeping high standards.  We'll be back!"
Jim W.,"Palm Springs, CA",477,363,,3.0,7/2/2008,"OK, since I did a review on one earlier, I thought, since I mentioned this one in that review, I had better rate this one. Yes, it is better than previous one.   HOWEVER, if you come here during ""season"" in the desert expect a L-O-N-G wait!!!  Jeez, and I do mean long!!!   Food is OK if you stick to the basics...don't order pasta or fish here...stick to burgers, sandwiches, salads, stuff like that.  The service, when I have been here, is good...I have never had to wait for anything at this location except a table.  Parking is all around this mall, but, you might have to walk a bit. Service: 4 Food: 3 Cheesecake:5 Waiting for table during season:1 Decor: 4"
Linda K.,"La Quinta, CA",0,2,,4.0,1/31/2012,"We dined there on 1/30/12. As always, the food and service was great.  The key to enjoying Cheesecake Factory is to go early because regardless of what restaurant you go to, when there are over 40  people waiting in line to get seated, something or everything will suffer. My issue with the Rancho Mirage location, is the booth seating comfort level.  The cushions need desperate help!! Guests may as well be sitting on TOP of the marble tables because there is NO upholstery or padding left to the seat-cushions.  We couldn't even sit there long enough for dessert or conversation. This is inexcusable for a restaurant, in my opinion. Comfort is a key element in having your guests enjoy the food and ambiance.  I have emailed the location, so I hope something gets done sooner, rather than later."
Scott C.,"Palm Springs, CA",2,40,,5.0,6/19/2013,"This is the first time I've eaten at a CCF since 1995 in Coconut Grove, FL. Glad the 2-hour waits I came to expect there aren't the reality here! For a national chain, CCF does an outstanding job. We had the Fried Chicken Sliders for an appetizer and chicken enchiladas and Tuscan chicken for entrees. Every part of the meal was spot on perfect, the food out of this world delicious. A bit on the spendy side, but you always have enough left overs for a lunch the next day. Martin was our waiter and he did an outstanding job, we wanted for nothing the entire meal. Of course the location at The River is spectacular, always a joy to be there. Try it, You can't go wrong."
Erick T.,"Azusa, CA",13,32,,2.0,2/27/2009,"Local: great Inside: loos like a cross between egypt/ italy/ and furniture store left overs Food: Ok- not great, not bad Ambiance: Too loud, ad the feeling of a cheap buffet bar Overall: would not be coming back to this or really any cheese cake factory if at all possible- i was dragged here!"
Diane P.,"San Diego, CA",15,47,6,3.0,7/27/2010,"I don't like to go to big national chain restaurants, but I am never disappointed with the Cheesecake Factory and the one in Rancho Mirage is no exception.  I visited the Cheesecake Factory for the first time in 1988 and I have been back many times and I have never been disappointed.  The food is consistent and good and they make the best hot fudge sundae anywhere."
Lori S.,"Indio, CA",0,65,2,5.0,8/17/2013,Always delicious. Been to many Cheesecake Factory restaurants and the food has always been top notch! One of our favorite places to go to eat.
Kari S.,"San Diego, CA",78,385,43,3.0,8/22/2010,Not much to say other than it is a Cheesecake Factory with lots of cheesecake. We have been to the one in San Diego a number of time and it is exactly the same. My mom and I both had salads and shared the hummus small plate. I do have to say that the service was really really slow for Friday afternoon.
Brian C.,"Lakeside, CA",15,306,23,5.0,9/1/2010,Came here for my wedding anniversary dinner and everything was great. Really like the river that surrounds the place gives it a cool look.
Darnelle B.,"Palm Desert, CA",321,201,27,5.0,1/26/2010,I have never had a bad meal here.  I mean the menu is huge!  The hardest thing I have is trying to figure out what to order!  They are very consistent from restaurant to restaurant and always seem to be packed.  How can you not love a restaurant that has sooo many different cheesecakes!
Mike T.,"San Diego, CA",3,34,2,4.0,6/9/2012,"Went here twice during a trip to Rancho Mirage/Palm Springs.  My wife and I decided to eat here because we weren't too familiar with the area, we wanted a good meal without getting ripped off too bad (meals at the Westin we stayed at were quite expensive!), and Cheesecake Factory tends to have a huge menu.  Our first trip there was actually quite pleasant.  We were greeted by courteous staff and we were seated in less than 10 minutes, the shortest wait time EVER for us at any Cheesecake Factory location during dinner time!  We received our food in a timely manner (wife ordered avocado spring rolls and I had the BBQ pork sandwich) and the food was actually really good.  The sandwich was like a whole rack of rib's worth of meat!  Coleslaw was good too.  It also came with fries, which I did not even touch because of the beast of a sandwich I ate.  We also ordered a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup cheesecake to go.  We returned later on during our trip for lunch.  The waitress was really nice and our water glasses were always topped off.  She even gave us water cups to go due to the insanely hot weather outside.  Most pleasant Cheesecake Factory experience by far."
Keith L.,"Redondo Beach, CA",0,73,,4.0,4/2/2011,Great desserts & professional waitstaff. I do wish they'd get with the times on portion size (super-sizing is on the way out) -- tough to eat their jumbo entrees and still have room for cheesecake!
