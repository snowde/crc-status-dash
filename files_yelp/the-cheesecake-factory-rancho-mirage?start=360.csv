Andrew F.,"Los Gatos, CA",2,15,,4.0,12/18/2008,I like thi splace. We just went to one up in San Jose and liked it too.  The egyptian temple feel is a bit much but the kobe beef burger is awesome. Both times I had it it was fresh and tasty. My wife likes the lettuce cups a lot and the cheescake is fine.
Jackie H.,"South San Francisco, CA",3,46,98,5.0,7/30/2012,This Cheesecake Factory is smaller than others that I have been too. It was my son's 11th bay so the waitress took care of him. The food was good. The service was good. To get to the entrance of the restaurant is tricky. You need to park across the street and enter along the side of other restaurants. We went on a Sunday during lunch at 11:30 just perfect timing. Hostess said evenings are crazy!
Mike F.,"Irvine, CA",396,599,48,4.0,5/15/2007,"As different chain restaurants have different results, Cheesecake factory seems to keep up to par with its sister locations. Overall design and layout keeps same as with all CFs throughout all of southern cali. The bar is small here but the bartenders are fantastic. Reservations are highly recommended as this place stays packed around 5-10...... I recommend a Grey Goose Orange with tonic w/a slice of lemon. Call it a Fuji tea."
Wendy L.,"Mission Viejo, CA",0,5,,1.0,1/17/2011,"If I could give zero stars I would! Please allow me to explain: We showed up and could see an abundance of open seating yet there was a 20 min expected wait time because they were waiting for more servers to come on shift. The waiting area was already full of people  Ordered two dirty martinis with bleu cheese stuffed olives... Came out wrong and nearly 15 minutes passed before they were delivered.  I ordered a chicken pear and endive salad, that arrived without the chicken our the candied pecans -the server who brought the salad simply told me they ran out of the pecans and said nothing relating to the missing chicken; upon complaining to the waitress she went in to find out what happened then returned to tell us they just got more nuts and were being roasted. I was however given the option to wait (yeah as if I'm going to wait some more at this place) our order a new item, which is what I elected to do.  The new meal came out after a period of time, and at this point my dates lunch had already gotten cold from sitting so long. The kicker is when the check was dropped off our waitress said, ""oh don't worry, I took that salad off there for you guys."" One would naturally assume that this was her attempt to redeem herself, but no, the salad that I ate was on there, then the salad they screwed up was added to the bill then deducted at the end!  It was humorous when the change came back to us and we had two quarters, a few pennies, and two dimes and a nickel. Couldn't they have just given us back three quarters? They probably ran out of change too. This facility seems highly unorganized and an embarassment to the restaurant industry. I love The Cheesecake Factory, but I will never return to this horrible establishment again."
Troy H.,"Huntington Beach, CA",1041,827,183,1.0,8/26/2007,"No stars for a reason!  My artichoke was barely cooked. The parts that were cooked, like the stem/heart were very woody. The chicken potstickers were soaking in the sauce, making them bloated and soggy.  And the service at the bar sucked. And they weren't busy at all! I felt like I was an inconvenience to them....... Damn rating system, 1/2 star given since I had to..."
Susan A.,"Kahului, HI",2,39,,4.0,10/31/2011,"Service was exceptional, food was delicious, portions were large.  I really enjoyed the Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes and the Thai Lettuce Wraps.  They were fresh,  and very tasty.  The portions are huge - so much so that everyone in our group had enough leftovers for lunch the next day."
Reanna R.,"Palm Springs, CA",34,188,81,4.0,1/10/2010,I love there food & they've changed the menu up a bit added a lot more variety.  THe price is a bit much but its a beautiful restaurant.  Very nice for romantic dinners.  The wait staff seems to each have too many tables so it takes a little while.  Their very friendly though.  I like this one better (as far as the place goes) than the one in San Diego.
Joel H.,"Rancho Mirage, CA",1,6,,5.0,9/4/2010,"Dish for dish, dollar for dollar, the best place to eat in the desert. Ask for Thomash to be your server."
Roy U.,"Desert Hot Springs, CA",0,25,1,4.0,2/3/2010,"The food was excellent, but the menu is too large, 20 pages including advertising, so it takes a long time to figure out.  Also the portions are too large so you don't have room for dessert. We sat outside which was nice on a warm day."
oola l.,"Carlsbad, CA",76,62,9,1.0,4/24/2009,They  use soybean oil and it was impossible to find anything that hadn't been touched by soy. They gave me some lettuce with a lemon. That was all that I could eat there. Besides the fact that it's really crappy non organic food. Had to eat there it was a friend's birthday. Blah!
Don M.,"Mokena, IL",382,460,23,4.0,12/1/2008,I had a hankering for desert. After licking the display case trying to figure out what I wanted. I choose the carrot cake. I was not paying attention because I thought it was the cheesecake. When the girl took a cake off the top of the counter and cut a honking huge piece and added some whipped cream. I didn't care if it was cheesecake or not. It was pretty good could have been a little more moist but hey it worked. Next time I might pay attention.
Nicole B.,"Newport Beach, CA",0,18,7,5.0,3/2/2010,"We ordered calamari and it was very tender, not chewy at all.  The pasta was decent and the dessert was amazing!  We ordered the red velvet cheesecake.  It was so good.  My husband got the 3 chicken tacos and it was very light and yummy!  Our service was perfect and our bill was under 6$0.00!"
Nicholas M.,"San Francisco, CA",0,59,5,5.0,7/30/2012,"This Cheesecake Factory is pretty chill.  It gets busy in like, February but right now they don't even seem to open all the sections up.  I ate in the back the other day and had the lunch portion of Orange Chicken, which was great.  I don't think the lunch size was on the menu but my server Cheryl recommended it and it was still too big."
Ashley H.,"Cathedral City, CA",4,89,6,4.0,2/6/2011,"Consistently good food and service. We usually go late at night, because they are one of the desert's late night dining options. Great small plates and appetizers especially. I also love their brown table bread. The servers that work late at night are not disgruntled or upset to be there. We tip them a little better just because working until 1am on a weekend night is not the most fun."
Braden P.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,15,,4.0,2/15/2010,HUGE menu and great food. Thats all i  have to say
Van M.,"Lakewood, CA",0,26,2,4.0,2/15/2010,"Overall my spouse and I had a good experience. We expected a long wait since we were there for a late lunch on Valentine's Day. The place was packed. But our wait was only about 30 minutes. Our waitress was very good. Food came out in a timely matter. I ordered the Chicken Maderia. It was EXCELLENT. However, the mash potatoes didn't have much flavor. My spouse ordered Renee's Special (half turkey sandwich, soup & small green salad). According to my SO, it was very good other than the salad which had some fancy type of lettuce it  (tasted bitter - not sure what it was).The waitress was very nice to replace it with a regular small garden salad. For dessert we shared a slice of lemon raspberry cream cheesecake. It was fantastic. We've been to several Cheesecake Factory's in California and we've always walked out happy."
Bernadette E.,"Las Vegas, NV",172,330,36,4.0,5/12/2008,it's just lovely at this particular location because it's on the water! on the water you say? in palm desert??? ok ok ok... so the lake is man made... who cares?!?!? : ) the caesar salad was terrific and the chicken fettucine with garlic and sun dried tomato sauce was AMAZING! why not treat yourself to a lovely dinner on the water at the desert sometime??
Emily B.,"Salinas, CA",3,4,,5.0,9/27/2010,"This location of the Cheesecake Factory is wonderful!  Yes, it's a ""chain"", and at the other locations I've always suffered an extremely long wait...but not in Rancho Mirage!  My husband and I visited this location again for lunch on our last visit to the S. CA desert.  We were seated promptly in a large booth (at the other locations we're often squished in between other diners at long tables) and started with the avocado eggrolls.  Delish!  After that, I enjoyed a tasty basil chicken pasta dish...followed by Red Velvet Cheesecake!  I'm a Texas girl, with a sweet tooth...and this cheesecake was heavenly!!!  (That's what I'm showcasing in my profile pic!)  The red velvet cake part tasted like it was made from scratch...tastes like my recipe for red velvet cake!!!  What else can I say?  My only disappointment is they no longer have Fresca ""on tap"", it's been replaced by Coke Zero, but their iced black tea was refreshing in the desert heat!"
Steven K.,"Palm Springs, CA",72,77,12,4.0,5/22/2007,"The book length menu takes your mind away from the nearly absent attendants. The food is good though. The desert is the best part, but you will probably not have room for it after the exceptionally large portions. The food selection is astronomical and the desert is gastronomical."
Clau d.,"Cathedral City, CA",0,11,,4.0,9/6/2010,"I really like the Cheesecake Factory in Rancho Mirage, but I just can't give them that 5th star because the last time my husband and I went there for lunch, the food and the service were not consistent with what we have experienced there in the past.  The service was very slow despite the restaurant not being very busy, and the quality of the calamari appetizer and the pizza we ordered was poor. The calamari portion was significantly smaller from previous times, and the waitress forgot the lemon and dipping sauce when she brought the appetizer.  Usually, they serve hot bread while you wait for your food, but this time, the waitress forgot to bring it out even after I asked her for some. The pizza we ordered for my daughter was terrible. On the other hand, the cheesecake we ordered was excellent and the drinks were cold.  We haven't been back to see if this last experience was just a fluke, but we might be willing to give them another chance in the future."
