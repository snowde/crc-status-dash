Alex T.,"Jackson, WY",0,6,,3.0,4/16/2017,"Jess our server was good... I think that it was busy and maybe she was trying not to be overwhelmed but when asked about drink prices could only say she didn't know.... Now Are you ------ kidding me? No prices on drinks? No explanation on why they don't have prices?? WTF!!! Someone explain this to me cause I'm not going back!!! Hey ya, I'll build your house but not sure it may be a couple hundred thou or a million not sure... God I wish I could say that to my customers.. For the most part food was decent and desserts of course great, service was nice but you guys untill you give me a reason why there are no prices on drinks you lost a family and friends of customers... Choa!!"
Andrew W.,"Oceanside, CA",0,23,11,5.0,4/12/2017,"Wendy....5 out of 5 stars for outstanding customer service today. She pleasantly answered all our questions and looked into vegan options. Great recommendations on cheesecake, banana cream was awesome. 5 kids and 3 adults, she made all have a delightful lunch."
Amber H.,"Twentynine Palms, CA",2,29,10,5.0,6/16/2017,"We went there for lunch yesterday and were waited on by Joe. He was super attentive, made sure our super hungry kids were able to order first and got their food quickly. Joe also helped us out with local park information!! Thank you, Joe for being awesome!!"
Linda A.,"Rancho Mirage, CA",8,3,4,3.0,7/19/2017,"Looks as though the help is overworked for the number of tables they need to service. Sat at the bar while awaiting our table. Appears no one cleared previous customers drinks or wiped down the surface. I ordered the ""Factory Burger"" cooked medium. It was served quite raw. The waiter agreed and sent it back. The waitress was very nice and friendly. I made a huge mistake in visiting the ladies restroom.. Who's in charge of keeping this area clean?? No TP in stall. Waste basket over the top with dirty paper towels and someone had decided to use the sink to bring up their dinner. It was disgusting..."
Michael G.,"Long Beach, CA",475,689,1448,3.0,2/2/2016,"I've been to Arcadia (Santa Anita), Brea, Glendale (American), Los Angeles (the Grove), Pasadena, Rancho Cucamonga (Victoria Gardens), and now Ranch Mirage. This location is honestly the most beautiful location I've been to. It even has the most beautiful entrance, sitting on an artificial body of water.  The service is great as well. Our server was extra nice and efficient. My food was yummy. My criticism has to do with the portion size of the salmon on my salad. It was the teeny tiniest piece of salmon I've ever ordered at a restaurant. It was like one salmon nugget. Luckily I had gift cards but if I had to use my own money, I would have been very upset. This meal being basically free, alleviated most of my negative feelings about the salmon nugget."
Katrina B.,"Twentynine Palms, CA",0,2,2,1.0,10/2/2017,"I went here to celebrate my daughter's birthday with about 20 guest only to arrive to a table full of dirty silverware but the attention to detail was resolved and I was ok. We enjoyed our waiter and none of this message concerns him. I then order the Ribeye Steak dinner that came not cooked well and it get sent back. The new steak comes out and it's basically the same Steak but now it's charred. The Manager on duty, older gentleman; sternly advices me that they can't keep bringing me out steaks because it's costing him, not the restaurant, $25 a Steak!!! This was the most unprofessional act yet. I had to eat soup and then it came with another piece of silverware. Oh of course, I'm bribed with a complimentary cheesecake over my Steak dinner that I just wanted cook correctly. WORSE!!"
Joe B.,"Yucca Valley, CA",2,86,9,5.0,3/26/2017,This place is beautiful. Great views and beautiful inside and out. My server Ben is the best :) Cheesy tots are yummy too
David H.,"Hemet, CA",0,19,4,5.0,6/16/2017,"We have been coming  to various Cheese Cake Factories for awhile, we came the Palm Desert one with my Dad and Uncle to celebrate an early Fathers Day, as usual the the food was excellent,  not to mention the service from Lorraine, thank you for your awesome attitude and service."
Adrian R.,"Indio, CA",0,6,7,5.0,9/11/2017,excellent food and great service our waiter and store manager went above and beyond to accommodate our party.
Tiffany C.,"State College, PA",105,26,9,5.0,8/11/2017,"Veggie burger was absolutely delicious here. Best one I've had in awhile. Atmosphere is very nice as well. Hostess staff was ""eh"" but our waitress and waiter were absolutely amazing. My only minor complaint is that it is so so dark here in the evenings! Could use a bit more light."
Charla M.,"Desert Hot Springs, CA",23,34,,2.0,1/8/2017,"Upon our arrival we noticed how beautiful the restaurant was. I have been to the Marina Del Rey, Canoga Park, Victoria Gardens, and The Grove locations and this one is the best looking one thus far. The wait wasn't very long but when our pager went off the young lady took our pager and said she would handle it, and she seated another family without letting us know what was going on. I went to the front desk to find out what was going on, and we were treated like what happened wasn't a big deal and treated as though we were stirring up trouble, and she said our menus were there and we would be seated.   When we were seated at the table the server gave us our water with NO straws. The server took our order and didn't check on us as much as she should have or anticipated our needs. She did not offer boxes for our food, she just watched it sit there, and finally she asked us if we needed her to box it up. The server did not bring enough napkins, and her attitude was so so. I asked the server for change and she brought back two 5's and ask could I wait for some 1's which took some time. Instead of the wait she could have just got change, it was for her tip. Despite what went happened, we still tipped her the 15%.  I feel it's all about the experience when you go to a restaurant, and we felt a little uncomfortable. The server was very bland even though she smiled. The other races that were being serviced by this server made them a priority, met their needs, and they even received straws with their drinks. I know there are probably not many African American patrons that come there but we shouldn't have to feel like it. I requested a manager and he was apologetic with a smirk on his face and it just didn't seem sincere. He said he would talk to the server. For the most part we felt that it was not an inclusive environment, it wasn't inviting, and it seemed like most of the staff treated us like we were out of our element or we we inconveniencing them in some way. Everyone that walks in that restaurant,  should be treated equally.  When individuals are in a customer service or service occupation they should be able to anticipate needs of their customers, make everyone feel welcomed, not assume that because they are a certain race that they are going to act a certain way, or assume what a persons reaction is going to be to something, and if the individuals do not have exposure to a certain culture, race, ethnicity, or sexual preference they should get educated.  I completed the survey and I left my information for someone to get back to me, I just might contact Corporate."
Peter H.,"Rancho Mirage, CA",28,26,,2.0,11/5/2017,"Wife and I arrived for a dinner over an hour before we were to go to a movie. Service was OK but we did not get our food in time to go to the movie though they kept promising it would be right out. Thus we left before eating and server had to get manager's ok not to charge us for the food we did not receive. Thus, we made the movie which was fortunately close and did not eat that night. They charged us for the 2 drinks we had and didn't even think that comping us would be be a nice ""good will"" gesture not that we expect anything for free. Doubt we will be back for awhile as lots of other good places to eat close by."
Glenda J.,"Seattle, WA",91,703,3044,5.0,8/19/2016,"One thing you can consistently count on with The Cheesecake Factory in any state is having to wait.  Short wait at the bar on a Friday night at 8 pm.  Nice!  Surprisingly kids are allowed here. Ordered: Pineapple Moscow mule:  served in a tall glass with a thin pineapple cross section slice. Good even though there was a very subtle pineapple flavor. Mango key lime cheesecake:  slice seemed smaller than other cheesecakes I've had.  Taste is great!  Has a toned down tartness of the key lime from the mango. Everything was great, then I saw what the party next to me had ordered - avocado rolls.  Ohhhh...This is my favorite!  I must have this! So dessert first, then appetizer...nom nom nom.  What brings this appetizer together is the tangy dipping sauce and the crispy skin of the roll.  Awesome! Service:  very attentive and a good listener - not the customary ""everything ok?"".  Our server/barman actually paused to wait for our responses.  Good eye contact and a genuine desire to ensure an outrageously happy experience. Will be back!"
Cole M.,"Costa Mesa, CA",2,22,,1.0,8/13/2017,The worst Cheesecake Factory EVER. No bread after watching 3 tables get served their orders & bread prior to them even acknowledging our order was coming. Seriously worst cheesecake I've ever been to.
Brandon R.,"La Quinta, CA",300,10,10,5.0,8/5/2017,The wait was long but worth it! Our server Shanna was amazing! She was friendly and was very helpful with my moms birthday. Awesome service and food!
Katyy L.,"Indio, CA",0,3,1,4.0,4/13/2017,"Decided to give this place another shot as this was the only place open at the river that I could see myself hanging out at for a while. I was pleasantly surprised at the service of my lovely waitress and I decided to sit outside and I have to say it was much better this time. The food also tasted fresher and my server let me know about specials and delicious combos I never would have thought of. I will be returning as the atmosphere has been kicked up a few notches, although I cannot speak for the previous three servers I've had the last couple of times I have gone here as they seem quite awkward and less then mediocre as servers. But my server this time was quite lovely and laid back but very attentive."
Lana K.,"Spring Valley, CA",142,51,89,1.0,7/12/2017,"Pretty terrible service. Came in. Typical cheesecake crowd so when I asked the wait time before we agreed to stick it out the blonde girl up front told us 10 minutes. 30 minutes later my dad hit a nerve and complained to the blonde girl up front. At this point my mom and I were fed up waiting so we just decided to leave. My dad yelled out ""I'll remember your shitty service!"" Blonde girl made no apologies and we walked out. Don't come here if you're on vacay head to PF changs instead"
Kelly W.,"Palm Desert, CA",9,51,183,5.0,7/16/2016,Cheesecake factory is always a wonderful choice for lunch or dinner. This time was lunch....
Lori W.,"Braintree, MA",67,19,11,2.0,10/30/2017,dessert time.  love the original cheesecake with strawberries.  but what happened to the portion size its shrunk!
Regina W.,"Los Angeles, CA",124,780,2001,4.0,6/19/2016,"I've been here a few times while visiting Palm Springs/Rancho Mirage. It's located inside ""The River"" mall which has other restaurants and shops. I usually get pasta and most recently had their shrimp bistro pasta, pork chops, and teriyaki steak. Everything was tasty and service was wonderful. We also didn't have to wait which is rare for other Cheesecake Factory locations. My only complaint is that there is no easy entrance from the parking lot for this restaurant. The parking is pretty far considering it's usually 100+ degrees in the area."
