Jorge M.,"Indian Wells, CA",93,24,15,5.0,3/27/2017,"Can't go wrong with this restaurant. Terrific variety of menu choices, satisfying portions, and reasonable prices. The bread is delicious, the steaks is one of my favorites though all are good. As for the huge selection of delicious cheesecake, forget the calories and just enjoy!"
T S.,"Brea, CA",2,12,58,5.0,3/30/2017,We just love this place. No matter what city we are in this is always a familiar meal! I really love that I can get breakfast all day  Service was great as always. Kids menu selection is great with several favorites. Dessert is always a must when eating here!!
Bre G.,"Palm Springs, CA",0,23,8,3.0,7/13/2017,"I've been here many times before, but I feel like it's over priced for the quality of the food which is mediocre. I can spend the same amount of money at a fine dining restaurant."
David M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,11,,5.0,10/4/2017,"Truly up to par with the Cheesecake Factory restaurants. Their ""Chicken Madeira"" is really a great menu item. My only complaint was that the artichoke I also ordered was undercooked, but 90% of the time I order it in other restaurants the same result happens. Overall, a wonderful place to eat."
Amy M.,"Indio, CA",205,195,1002,4.0,6/11/2015,"Every time I visit the Indio area to see my hubby we would go to the Cheesecake Factory for our anniversary. We have been here twice after seeing a movie at the river and both times it did not disappoint. Once we got seated outside which was lovely but there was a lack of lighting. The other time we were seated inside. The waitresses we had were friendly and attentive and the food was great. I love that there were so many vegetarian options for hubby and so many meaty options for me. We had a tiramisu cheesecake for dessert and it was heaven. We had also got a 8"" red velvet cheesecake to go cause it was also that good.  Needless to say, I will be back this summer and will continue to see if they have maintained their loveliness."
Mordi B.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,28,45,1.0,1/1/2017,"We love the food here most of the time, today they fail measurably,  Pancakes with butter instead of maple syrup ? English muffins full o butter  Everything was to much batter  Not the place for branch, Coffee in glass cup? about 1 hour wait for the food  Too Expenssive for bad food"
Dara S.,"Los Angeles, CA",189,385,46,5.0,11/1/2016,"Yes, even myself is pleasantly surprised by giving The Cheesecake Factory a beaming 5 star review but it is well deserved. Service was great, we never had to track down our waitress. Our server was also knowledgeable about the menu and friendly. Food came in a timely manner, the list of positives goes on. I ordered the almond crusted salmon salad which is extremely light and refreshing. If you ask for the dressing on the side this is an extremely low calorie and healthy option, this is coming from a personal trainer lol. To be honest, this doesn't even need dressing since the kale is massaged with lemon and olive oil. I also added a side of steak to this because the salmon was a little small. My friend and I shared the red velvet cheesecake and cookie dough cheesecake. Both are so amazing omg. The red velvet cheesecake is VERY rich, there is A LOT of cream cheese frosting. While the cookie dough cheesecake is definitely not light but less sweet.  Next on my list to try is the s'mores cheesecake and pumpkin pecan pie cheesecake.  Honestly, the menu is huge but it's very easy to find something and I was very impressed with my salad!"
Esther R.,"Banning, CA",0,4,,1.0,10/15/2017,"Worse​ service by the Host.It was our first time there ,there was only 2 guest ahead of us so i was placed on the waitlist by 2 girl host.That was no problem we waited for about 20 minutes waiting.Though 3 parties came after and were all seated so i got up to ask the host.She said my name was never placed,its so sad how she didnt bother to sit us.She just added me to the waiting list again.So unproffesional i drove one hour for bad service.Me and my family ended walking out the host practically ignored us it was about 4pm on Sunday.Never going back"
Matthew G.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,3,5.0,7/18/2017,this is my favorite restaurant to eat anytime! The food was really good and our waiter was so nice. The food came to our table within 5-10 minutes and the wait time to get seated was about 10 minutes. Ok that's all bye!
Stephen F.,"WOODLAND HLS, CA",1060,22,8,4.0,5/13/2017,"Great food, great price, great service. Obviously a culture thing to have sustained this long. Big Kudos to our waitress Jackie and her manger Timothy Fox. Spot on and well done."
Harout H.,"Carlsbad, CA",13,63,108,2.0,5/28/2017,Came here with the family on a Sunday brunch enjoying a great time with great meals. The only reason I'm giving a 2 star is because not only did my cup have food residues so did my cutlery which was the cherry on top.
Maureen S.,"London, Canada",0,43,65,5.0,5/12/2017,"My husband and myself had been to a matinee movie at the Century at the River and since it was just past 4 pm we decided to try the Happy Hour at The Cheesecake factory. We sat at the bar, had a cosmopolitan martini each for $5.95 and then ordered 3 appetizers for $5.95 each. We shared the Avocado egg rolls, the Buffalo Blasts and the Southern Fried Chicken Sliders. All three were amazing, very flavourable and arrived hot and fresh. We can't wait to go back to try the Fried Macaroni and Cheese, Factory Nachos and Roadside Sliders. You won't be disappointed. No Happy Hours on the weekend."
Cathy E.,"Cathedral City, CA",24,56,7,5.0,4/22/2017,"Beautiful restaurant, excellent service, great food and cheesecake. Reasonable prices.   I love this place."
Felipe H.,"Palm Springs, CA",74,35,11,1.0,10/6/2017,"We came in Tuesday night (10/4) at about 9:50pm. The host immediately sat us down and told us our server would be right with us. We waited and waited, but no one ever came. I was going to try and get the attention of a server or staff, but nobody was to be seen. Anyway, after waiting for over 20 minutes we decided to get up and leave. We informed the host of our experience and that's why we were leaving. All she said was ""Oh I'm sorry about that""....that's it! She didn't even try to figure out what had happened or offered to help us or call a server over. NOTHING. This is honestly the worst service I have ever received at a restaurant out here in the desert. I would be more understanding if they were busy, but it was so slow. We come here frequently, but I'll never eat at a restaurant where my business is not valued. It's sad how poor employees ruin businesses. This is exactly why The River is in the shape it's in."
Tae G.,"Los Angeles, CA",101,765,1929,4.0,3/19/2016,"Typical Saturday night long wait. The outside ambiance of live music around the river was nice and I love coming to this area every year we go to Palm Springs for our conference. My coworker and I ordered crab and cheese dip and crab cakes for appetizers. The dip was nothing to rave about. My herb-crusted salmon barely had any fresh herbs on it, but was light and flaky, nonetheless. She enjoy her filet. For dessert, we both ordered cheesecake. My red velvet was um-um good!"
Sharquay N.,"San Jacinto, CA",0,14,24,3.0,5/15/2017,Staff wasn't prepared for Mothers day. All our food was cold. My cup had food on the outside of it. The waitress and manager were great. But other then that I don't see myself coming back.
Loui G.,"Palm Desert, CA",3,30,4,5.0,12/3/2016,"I came here last week and tried their carrot cake. It was the best I ever tasted! And not only that, they put whip cream and decorated it like I was some kind of celebrity. It was great to have such a simple piece of cake but had so much attention put into it. I highly recommend this restaurant, if only for the desserts!"
Jamal H.,"West Hollywood, CA",0,5,,5.0,8/30/2017,"I dined at this location over the weekend, and my server Wendy B. made it a great experience.  She thought ahead, offered suggestions, and was kind.  Kudos to Wendy B!!!"
Jassmine B.,"La Quinta, CA",0,3,4,1.0,5/27/2017,Probably the worst place I've ever been to eat. But then again why would I go to a food chain to start with... Ordered a salad because the rest of their menu wasn't so great to say the least... Took almost an hour to get our food and when it arrived all of us were disappointed. My cousin got this spicy chicken that was actually the most horrible thing I've ever tasted and my other cousin got spaghetti which was honestly the most disgusting thing I've ever seen and to top it off her sister got this weird hamburger with a stale french bread for the buns. She couldn't even bite into. Would give this place negative stars if I could
Riley F.,"Grand Terrace, CA",209,312,20,5.0,2/25/2017,Very good service and food. They are definitely on it here. Dined outside and it was very beautiful.
