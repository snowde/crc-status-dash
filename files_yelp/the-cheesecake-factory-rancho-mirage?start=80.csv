Tom C.,"Rancho Mirage, CA",3,113,32,5.0,4/23/2017,"Always great food always great service it's so nice to be treated right. My favorite thing is always being able to walk into the bar and sit right down and order it's great. Back again oh man that Orange Chicken is ""The Best in the Business"" and damn that mocha is the bomb! I need a wheel chair after thatbetter get that desert to go again."
Danny C.,"Indio, CA",3,3,,1.0,4/22/2017,"Horrible experience, after getting there. We were told that it would be a 10 minute wait. After 23 of waiting and seeing everyone else being seated. I approached the hostess and asked when we would be seated. She was on the phone and was rude. I understand that we were a group of 6 but another group came after us and they had 8 in there party, so that couldn't be it, and then I saw our differences they were white and we weren't."
Lee M.,"Carleton, MI",12,2,,1.0,7/27/2016,It was busy night so I gave a little leeway. But after 30 minutes and not even a drink offer it was time to go.  I will not be back.   I've gotten better service at Denny's.
Dan M.,"Rancho Mirage, CA",0,8,1,5.0,5/15/2017,"I love this place ever since we moved in to Rancho Mirage and every time we dined into this Rancho Mirage location, its always been a pleasant one (food and service).  I would like to put a review however on our last visit dine out with the whole family of 4.  It was Mother's day dinner and as usual its packed and its worth a wait.  I would like to special mention a special person who served us very good, very polite, very customer oriented person and her name is Estefani A.  Despite of her busy assignment, multi-tasking for the most part,  she still manage her composure and the smile.    I commend her for being our host that night.  The best ever.  The food was great and the service.  Well, this location is lucky to have Estefani A.  If I were to own a restaurant someday, this fine lady is hired without interview.  She will be an asset to me.   Dan M.  760-830-1542"
Gabby A.,"Manila, Philippines",147,108,323,2.0,6/9/2016,"Went in at lunch time. It was not very busy. Many empty tables near the bar at least. Maybe they were understaffed today? So I walked in with my friend and was told we would have to wait about 10 minutes. We literally did have to wait 10 minutes even more just to be seated when there were empty tables. So not a good start. Our server who I did see was busy with other customers took a while to get to us. We had ample time to figure out what to order. We ordered and then the server came back and asked if we wanted bread. Ofcourse we did. After another 10 minutes we finally got some water and our bread.  I ordered the Chicken BBQ pizza which was average..I always got this before but I feel it was better at the other locations I have been to. My friend ordered the lunch pasta. She said it was too oily didn't even eat half of it.  We didn't even stick around to order cheesecake. Oh well. Definitely wasn't a good visit to the cheesecake factory. I think our server just had too much to do.  Not sure if I will come back. Maybe just to get a slice of cheesecake to go. However, I did see that people were even waiting to just order cheesecake from the cheesecake counter because no one was back there... :("
Vivien B.,"Escondido, CA",0,40,7,1.0,4/8/2017,"Hire some staff.  The wait is ridiculous.  If you wait over 30min anywhere, your not really hungry.   Consider that while you hold your pager at this place."
Dani S.,"Santa Ana, CA",1006,2146,4147,3.0,10/1/2014,"Food is very very mediocre, but our waiter during my last visit was excellent. Came here one weekday for a work lunch with a few coworkers. We ordered soup, salad and an appetizer to share. The Ahi tuna tartare was really bad, and the fish was stinking. The salad had too much salad dressing in them, and I could barely taste the salad greens. The cheesecake was overly sweet and I had a hard time swallowing the giant amount of sugary.  Our waiter was really funny and really nice. He gave us recommendations, and provided excellent service! We really liked him. Drinks refilled regularly, and he came back often to ask how we were doing. Bathrooms are clean, parking was very easy in the parking lot."
Vanessa G.,"Beaumont, CA",0,6,2,5.0,9/3/2017,"This is one of the few affordable places that offers complimentary bread. Every location I have visited  has awesome service, cleanliness, and quality/quantity of food."
Ron V.,"La Quinta, CA",5,34,21,4.0,2/20/2016,Wow--place has gone downhill since I was here in 2013. My second visit here in 2016... This trip the cheesecake factory definitely redeemed itself. We sat at the bar and I would highly recommend to everyone that you do this if there is a long wait. The bartenders are your waiters and they are right there at the counter ready to get you whatever you need so you don't have to wait for a waiter. Excellent service excellent food.
Andrea C.,"Irvine, CA",154,147,47,3.0,6/19/2016,"I was visiting Palm Springs and we decided to eat here because of the variety of options. The location and restaurant was very nice.. a lot nicer than the other cheesecake factories I've been to.  The wait was long but it was not a problem since we were able to walk around outside.  When we finally got our table, I sat down on a chair that was really dirty. It left marks on my pants which really annoyed me. I got upset because it tells a lot about a place when the table and chairs are not clean. My pants were sticky also. I talked to the manager about it, I believe his name was Daniel and he was very considerate and nice about everything. I appreciated him for being so friendly and understanding.  The food overall was good. I got a chicken plate with a really good lemon sauce. I subsisted the mashed potatoes for pasta which was excellent. The food was great and the service was a bit slow but that's because it was busy.  I would recommend making reservations & checking your chairs before sitting on them! The food was 4/5. Overall 3/5."
Kathy P.,"La Quinta, CA",1,23,6,2.0,2/3/2017,"Very average food, fairly expensive and noisy.  It was also very dark and difficult to read the menu.  We hadn't been there in a couple of years and probably won't in the future.  Much better places around to eat than here."
Lupe A.,"West Covina, CA",0,35,2,5.0,8/2/2017,This is one of our favorite spots to eat when e visit Palm Desert!! Food was great and service was Excellent!!
Paolo R.,"Rancho Mirage, CA",0,13,,4.0,4/4/2017,"Always very consistent, steak Dianne is always good... salads are getting smaller but still love the beet, apple and feta......."
Ivan C.,"Indio, CA",32,13,36,4.0,2/14/2016,"Feb 14 check in around 3:05 waited about 48 minutes to be seated,that BTW my table was dirty, there was left over food and trash on the floor that I had to request to be cleaned and swept.  My drinks arrived at 4:39 and my order is been taken at this time since I hade the time to look at it ...for a really long time After getting the attention of not one but two different hostess my drinks arrived but with a bad attitude. After 28 more minutes of taking my order food arrived and I gave a 4.5 out of 5 in rating for the actual food & drinks because although the food was good the server and hostess was horrible."
Jeff B.,"Newport Beach, CA",0,6,1,3.0,8/19/2017,Consistent cheesecake quality - you get large sized portions and fairly good tasting food.   A few bugs flying around was a nuisance.  You have to really come in to the shopping center to  find it.  Parking and directions from parking weren't clear.  Whether it was Siri or the facility not sure.  Lindsey was our waitress and terrific!
Matt P.,"Port Townsend, WA",0,7,,2.0,2/25/2017,Sent salad back and the steak was not made as ordered.  Worst value restaurant of our week long stay in Mirage.
Edith M.,"Los Angeles, CA",35,4,,5.0,8/12/2017,"Great service! Lisa our server was the best...thank you for the great service. All food was good except for the medallón steak, it was very salty. Thanks Lisa for taking care of our party! 5 stars for service!"
Marko N.,"Palm Desert, CA",17,285,276,4.0,6/20/2016,"My wife and I enjoy coming here for the dirty martinis (with blue cheese stuffed olives of course)...one of the best I have had in any restaurant, they seem to nail it every time. Nice to just relax in one of the booths and enjoy a drink, or if nice cooler weather, outside seating by the water is great. We have also come here for the happy hour. The happy hour is great, usually between 4-6 at the bar. Good prices, and they have a pretty good selection of food and drinks...the food selection on the happy hour menu is vast, but they could offer a few more selections on the drink menu. The taste of the food is good, not spectacular, but good. Drinks are good as well, not anything to celebrate about, but it is good. The other thing is the service could be better, and I think that is the bulk of the negative reviews from this place... Our waiter disappeared a couple of times, not to be seen anywhere...but made up for it later. Plus really good location at the river, nice to walk around after in the evening...oh and yes the cheesecake is good."
Danny T.,"La Jolla, CA",158,321,7,3.0,5/31/2016,"Just like every other Cheesecake Factory - food is consistent and the restaurant is packed.  It's located in the middle of the mall and there is definitely a lot of foot traffic here.. We got ours to-go, and it's the quality you come to expect.  Not that big of a deal, but they didn't get us all the condiments we requested in the phone order.. One minor rant for the to go box - they should use ones that are ventilated for fried food... our fried shrimps were soggy by the time they got home..."
Mike M.,"Indio, CA",13,5,,5.0,2/26/2017,"Awesome food and awesome service, the resuturant is beautiful in side.  Very clean, I would go back any time."
