Danielle D.,"Santa Barbara, CA",62,24,71,5.0,12/30/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory is the perfect ""go-to"" restaurant when you're with a group of ""I-don't-care-where-we-go"" ers. I've even been alone and that's great, too.  My most recent trip was alone around 3:30 in the afternoon. I was seated next to the window that overlooks the marina and boats. Beautiful spot!  I ordered the Cobb salad which was about the size of Mars, but I'm not complaining! Who complains about TOO much food? It's called a TO-GO box! To go home and enjoy and eat again (which is like typically an hour after I leave the restaurant ;D ).  My server was Travis and he was super kind, attentive, and prompt. He immediately greeted me with bread, water, and even offered his favorite recommendations which I love (more reasons to come back and try new dishes)!  This place can definitely get packed. Like, DMV packed. Just find an awkward time to eat on a weekday and do it. The bar is also self-seating, so opt for that if you can't swim your way to the host/hostesses booth.  Attached pictures are of the Thai Lettuce Wraps (appetizer) and the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta that I've had before too, DROOOOL!  Writing this has sure sparked my craving for some avocado rolls and thai coconut chicken..."
Elizabeth K.,"Torrance, CA",19,2,6,3.0,1/7/2018,"The Cheesecake Factory has honestly been one of my favorite restaurants in the South Bay so it makes me feel a bit heart broken writing this, but after many visits to this restaurant the bad experiences outweigh the good. Today was an example of a bad experience when I ordered my favorite dish of Eggplant Parmesan and requested that the pesto be replaced with marinara(because of my allergies). The waitress came back a while later saying that the pasta itself was made with pesto and asked if that was okay, I said it wasn't and that I would like regular spaghetti pasta with marinara sauce. We had an understanding or so I thought. The waitress that came out with my dish was different from the waitress who took my order so she went to consult with her. I was out eating lunch with my mom and her order arrived just fine(even though hers was modified as well) so I told her to eat w/o me. Backstory: I've had a terrible experience with staff at a different Cheesecake Factory location in Santa Monica in which they tried convincing me to eat the wrong order they brought out of Eggplant Parmesan with pesto since they didn't want to remake it. I didn't want to cause a scene since I was out with friends so I firmly told them that I couldn't consume it and it wasn't my order. They ended up bringing someone who appeared to be the manager over to our table to convince me to eat the Eggplant Parmesan with pesto even though I told them I was allergic to the pesto. I told them for the last time that this wasn't my order and I will not be eating this. They reluctantly took it back while I told my friends to go ahead and eat without me since their orders have been out for a while now. We were also seated near a area in which the staff met up so we saw them looking over to our table, whispering to each other and I couldn't hear what they were saying, but at this point I just about had it and was ready to leave. My order came back ""fixed"" on the same plate with the same eggplants just with different pasta, long after my friends had finished eating. I wasn't hungry anymore, but I ate a little bit of the pasta so I wouldn't look like a brat who asked them to fix the order only to not eat it and I got sick afterwards which was expected considering it wasn't fixed properly so we left.  The waitress at the Cheesecake Factory from today tried to convince me that the pasta had basil oil and not pesto so there shouldn't be any problem then asked about my specific allergies. This made me feel like she was trying to find every possible reason to get me to eat the dish and not have it remade. She then proceeds to tell me that I never said that I wanted marinara on my pasta and that I only said I wanted it on my eggplant. This woman was not my original waitress who took my order so I don't know why she would say such a thing. I even clearly stated to my other waitress that I wanted regular spaghetti with marinara instead of the pesto. She pinned the blame of the wrong order on me and looked at me like ""what do you want me to do about it"" so I told her I wasn't comfortable eating this and that I wanted what I ordered. She was obviously annoyed at this point and went back to the kitchen.  My order was brought out again and she asked it was correct, it wasn't, but I said it's fine so she would go away. My original waitress came by asking if everything was alright because she noticed that I didn't even touch the food and I said I wanted to take the food home. She could clearly tell I was very upset at this point because I was on the verge of tears out of pure frustration so she quietly packaged it up and left it on our table. I ended up wasting about $20 on a incorrect order I was not satisfied with which was a bit pricey to begin with, but what made it worse was that it's not going to be eaten and is literally going to waste.  The only good thing that came out of this was the Fried Cheese small plate with marinara sauce I ordered before things went downhill. The Fried Cheese small plate ended up becoming my lunch along with two small slices of the free bread which was sad because I haven't eaten all day and was looking forward to a meal, not a snack.  The wait for the small plates was about 20 minutes while the main course took an additional 30 minutes. My mom actually ended up falling asleep waiting for the food to arrive which I thought was sad that service was slow enough that there was time for a nap.  Valet parking is available and is $4 during the day and goes up at night. There is also street parking available which I believe is about $1.50 or $1.75 an hour which may be cheaper than valet depending on how long you plan on staying so make sure to bring quarters. There is also a great view of the marina and it's especially beautiful during sunset. The lighting inside the restaurant itself is quite dim so it's best to come during the day time when there is a lot of natural light if you want the best pictures of your food."
Vicki A.,"El Segundo, CA",1,9,2,4.0,12/22/2017,"Went for a business meeting with three of us. Arrived at the restaurant at opening on a Friday, 11:30 a.m. and it was already getting busy. My only complaint is about the huge size of the menu; really too big! So I gave up on that and ordered from the Skillylicious menu which is their collection of fresh options with lower calories.  I had a garden salad - small - that was not small at all. Very tasty. Enough veggies - carrots, cucumbers, tomatoes  and zucchini - that I didn't even need dressing. Nor could I finish it.  For the main course, I had Shrimp Summer Rolls. There were 4 - 6 wrapped rolls with asparagus, shrimp, mushroom, cilantro and rice noodles served with peanut dipping sauce. There was too much food to finish.  The two others I was with enjoyed theirs as well. One of the gentlemen was on a very restrictive diet and requested much of it on the side and our server had no problems with any of the requests. She was super prompt and polite and her service was excellent.  I recommend The Cheesecake Factory for a nice lunch overlooking the harbor. The view was excellent! Sort of know what you want to eat or expect to spend 15 minutes reading the choices. Although we skipped it this time, the cheesecake is also excellent with white raspberry chocolate being my favorite.  Valet parking is $2.50 or you could probably park not right in the harbor at no cost."
Max S.,"Palos Verdes Estates, CA",399,166,1660,4.0,11/4/2017,"I came here with coworkers during lunch on Friday, which turned out to be a great time to come. It has been a while since I have come to this particular Cheesecake Factory because it is extremely busy in the evenings and on the weekends.  Their location is great, right next to the marina. They have limited free, self parking. The rest of the parking lot is valet, which costs $2.50.  The food portions are still big. I ordered the Asian Chicken Salad off their Skinnilicious menu, which is a nice alternative. This menu offers meals that are fewer in calories than the regular menu. It was a pretty large salad; I couldn't eat it all. Yet, I still ordered dessert, the Coffee and Cream Chocolate Cheesecake. When you are the Cheesecake Factory, it does not make sense not to order a cheesecake."
Antonio M.,"Marina del Rey, CA",1017,180,1195,4.0,12/18/2017,"What is there not to like about The Cheesecake Factory?!?!? The menu is HUGE, you can literally order anything you can think of! From fish tacos to burgers to pizza to salads to breakfast items. I love going here and the Mdr location is amazing. The one thing I do not like is that if you dine outside the menu is limited. I don't get that, just because you are a few more feet away from the kitchen the chefs are able to make that ""one"" meal for you? But either way, I love this spot. Caesar salad here is a must for me. The wheat bread is absolutely my favorite with the caesar salad.  Their burgers are all very good! NY Strip is actually very delicious. Stuffed mushrooms - YOU HAVE TO GET Cheese Wedges - YOU HAVE TO GET I've never had something there I didn't like!"
Mimi L.,"Torrance, CA",3209,1017,9804,5.0,10/10/2017,"This Cheesecake Factory has the best views of Redondo Beach marina, the patio seating we were seated had a even better view on the water and a very relaxing vibe.   I have always liked The Cheesecake Factory even though I don't usually order their cheesecakes. I liked the new snacks and small plates menu along with the new specialties. We ordered a few small plates to sample like chicken nuggets, edamame, skinnylicious salmon roll and Korean spicy cauliflower, they were very comforting and flavorful. Hubby had carne asada steak medallions, they overcooked it the first time but the second time was done right that hubby liked his steak so much. When it comes to The Cheesecake Factory, I don't think about calories and sodium, just love their signature rich flavors.  We shared a bottle of Prosecco, food and drinks were great paring, our server was very attentive and friendly, it was a perfect Monday late lunch for hubby and I. We will come to this Cheesecake Factory often, it's actually the closest location to me too."
Jasmine S.,"Gardena, CA",4,84,60,5.0,10/12/2017,"My boyfriend and I came here for lunch. We normally go to the one located in marina del rey, but decided to come here because we were in the neighborhood. It was nice weather so we decided to sit outside. Our server was Darlene, and she was amazing! We both ordered the shrimp scampi and steak diane and we absolutely loved our food!! Neither one of us eat cheesecake so we ordered the godiva brownie sundae and it was delicious! Love the chocolate candy that comes with the sundae and the flavor was so rich and the almonds went very well w/the fudge, ice cream, and whip cream. Overall we had a gr eat experience and will definitely be back."
Kat M.,"Redondo Beach, CA",673,731,348,2.0,7/30/2017,"I love the Cheesecake Factory!  Their cheesecake is my absolute favorite, and I eat it regularly.  However, the food at this location has continued to decline.  (Other Cheesecake Factories have not had this decline.) Recent Complaints during several different meals (We used to dine here regularly until now): 1. I had a rubber band in my food.  The manager came over and said that the rubber band was from the cilantro, and it accidentally made it's way into my food.  He apologized, but did not offer us any compensation.  I was on a lovely date with my hubby and did not want to cause an issue, so I held my tongue until now.  I literally had to pull a purple rubber band out of my mouth and wasn't even offered a dessert. 2. My artichoke had paper in it that said artichoke.  The waitress comped this without us having to ask.  This made me lose my appetite.  3. My miso salmon, which I usually love, was overcooked.  It still tasted good enough, so I did not complain.  I was on another date with my hubby, and wanted to just enjoy my evening with him. 4. Today my cheesecake had paper in it.  I pulled it out of my mouth, unrolled it, and discussed it with my server.  She apologized and said that the cakes come with this paper to separate the cheesecakes.  I did not make a deal about it. 5. My salad today had almost no chicken.  I thought the kitchen forgot the chicken.  I was showing our server that they forgot the chicken, when I finally spotted a piece after moving the salad at least 5-6 times searching for chicken with my fork.  She had the manager give us more chicken.  The rest of the salad was seriously lacking in ingredients.  There was a skimpy amount of corn, beans and cheese.  We just ate at the Pasadena location twice, and their Santa Fe salad was amazing.  I don't like paying $16 for lettuce. I still LOVE their cheesecakes, but this location has lost my business until they CLEAN up their act.  I don't appreciate finding rubber bands and paper in my food on a somewhat regular basis.  I was only offered something to make up for these faux pas 1/3 times I found foreign objects in my food.  This location is skimpy on their ingredients. The cheesecake is still AMAZING =).  The new Celebration Cheesecake is yummy and fun!  The view is very pleasant, ocean and sailboats."
Robert V.,"Los Angeles, CA",3138,400,225,4.0,10/20/2017,"After my awful experience at The Cheesecake Factory in Santa Monica I thought I would never return to the chain again. A friend suggested we meet up in Redondo Beach and decided he wanted to meet at Cheesecake Factory.  Upon entering I was greeted by the three people working at the front desk. Since this was a Thursday night we were seated right away.  Our server Gerardo G was beyond awesome... such a friendly and amazing guy.  We ordered and the food came rather quickly.  My friend had the meatloaf and I had the pasta carbonara with chicken. He raved about the meatloaf; however, while the pasta carbonara had plenty bacon and the noodles were hot and fresh the sauce was kinda bland. Maybe I am too picky, but I would try it again. Overall, everything was great as the manager came by and introduced himself as we told him the service was awesome. If you decide on this place ask for Gerardo!"
Ray F.,"Los Angeles, CA",17,12,11,5.0,12/27/2017,"Went to the Cheesecake Factory for happy hour for the first and I might say its very impressive, the drinks is worth every penny, and the appetizers of course is amazing, the dish I had was a burger it comes with two patties which is great, I will be back nice place to socialize and hang with friends for a reasonable price, I WILL BE BACK"
Craig Y.,"Torrance, CA",1159,1149,11927,4.0,10/8/2017,I've been here many times pre Yelp. Located in Redondo Beach near the pier on restaurant row. They have a very tiny self parking majority of time you will have to valet park since they have a bigger lot. Coming on a Sunday or Saturday for brunch to sit inside can be a wait from 45 to a hour during the brunch time 10am- 2pm we sat out in patio which was less of a wait. Service is ok food wise can be slow but service in general was good. I ordered the lunch pasta special for the pasta with shrimp and sausage minus the onions and peppers but it was still spicy for me now I know next time to stick with the shrimp and angel pasta or the four cheese pasta. Also got a Godiva chocolate cheesecake to go hopefully that won't disappoint later on. Overall I like coming here just the parking and wait time discourages me but I'm sure I'll be back again.
Selah D.,"Long Beach, CA",0,6,,1.0,1/9/2018,"TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. A few girls and I went to grab drinks and there skinny Long Island ice tea tasted terrible. The the waitress named Virginia who had already been giving us attitude & She was visibly annoyed when we took one sip and asked to exchange the drink for a skinny mojito and went to tell her manager. The manager Ray proceeded to come over to our table and speak to us like we were kindergarteners in a condescending tone about how skinny drinks ""taste different and he's confused on why we sent them back""  We simply told him. The taste of the skinny Long Island tasted bad and we just want something else. He was not satisfied with that answer and kept nagging us on more info. Now people in the restaurant are staring, we can't enjoy our time together and we are agitated. So we tell him he has ruined our evening and we are leaving. 3 out of us 4 girls DID NOT EVEN TOUCH THE DRINKS because he was reprimanding us the whole time so we told him to take everything back and we're not paying. When we go to leave, 2 of his staff (Antoinette & Virginia) come running after us accusing us of a dine & dash and Antoinette starting using the F word at us. The manager Ray comes out & it takes a whole other 15mins to resolve! Ray goes on to a long sermon about how his bartender is a veteran and has been making drinks for years and he's so confused as to why several girls didn't like their drink. I have never in my life gone somewhere and if you order something and you do not like it , that they will not let you return it in exchange for something else. ABSOLUTELY WILL NOT EVER COME TO THIS RESTAURANT AGAIN."
Melody K.,"Los Angeles, CA",621,265,78,2.0,10/10/2017,"This one of the nicest Cheesecake Factory's I have visited. The ambiance is incredible and the service in really really nice.  The food however, unfortunately, is just as bad as any other Cheesecake Factory since their flavors had a decline for whatever reason... when was it, around 2010? I feel like it was at the same time as they started sharing how many calories are in their dishes... such a shame for it used to be a nice place to indulge in every now and again."
Michelle M.,"Long Beach, CA",10,44,177,4.0,12/23/2017,Fried Mac and Cheese Balls?  These were sooo good!  They were perfectly crispy and the marinara sauce hit the spot!  @eat.drink.post
Vicely C.,"San Pedro, Los Angeles, CA",1,8,5,1.0,12/2/2017,"After our dinner which was great, service was great as well but as for our dessert I decided to grab it on the go I chose two flavors my total came out to 19 dollars for two slices! Only two slices so I figured okay they better be big slices for a ridiculous price of 9 dollars a slice welp I was sooo wrong they are tiny slices! I am so mind blown ! Was not what I expected and I'm so disappointed that they would give such tiny slices for such a high price, all I wanted was to enjoy my dessert now I'll be eating my cheesecake baby slice thinking I could of bought a full cheese cake from costco for the price of one"
Selena D.,"Chino, CA",3,57,35,3.0,12/19/2017,I've heard amazing things about this restaurant. My cousin actually works here so I was given a whole list of dishes I HAD TO try and had to stay away from. I have to say I was pretty disappointed. The food is so pricey and I know you get what you pay for and you definitely get enough but I almost feel like you get too much. I know that's not what someone typically would complain about but it was too much for bf and I. Then again I guess it could be related to that fact that they give free bread and who the hell doesn't love free bread??? CRAZY PEOPLE Thats who ! But I do have to say their service is top notch. That is why I give them 3 stars. Another reason I docked two stars is because I do not feel their food was of the best quality. I would expect better quality if I am paying that much for it. Their cheesecake is amazing though!
Alyse T.,"Torrance, CA",207,158,859,3.0,6/15/2017,"Cheesecake Factory can be counted on for consistently good food, ambiance and service, and this location is no exception. Their ridiculously large menu and excellent view of the ocean makes this a great place to celebrate a special occasion.  I came here on a Sunday for dinner to celebrate my mom's birthday. We were seated right away at a nice table with a view. I split two appetizers with my boyfriend. We ordered: Avocado Toast: Cheesecake Factory is trying to hop onto this trendy bandwagon. Their version is a bit underwhelming. They take the standard bread they give you before the meal, toast the crap out of it, then pile some avocado on top. The bread is simply too hard and thick to eat easily. Otherwise it's quite tasty.  Samosas: this appetizer comes with 4 small pieces. They're fried nicely and have a good curry flavor. The yogurt sauce was pretty good too.  The service was excellent as per usual. They gave my mom a complimentary sundae and sang happy birthday to her. Pricing is the same as every other location - the good thing is generally the portions are so large you get two meals out of it. Don't skimp on the cheesecake - it's the best part!"
Alex W.,"Playa Vista, Los Angeles, CA",406,629,1513,5.0,9/7/2017,"Delicious food, great menu with plenty of options, fantastic happy hour, and enormous portion sizes.  I never understand how some people don't like The Cheesecake Factory.  The Nachos are a great happy hour selection, as are the Fried Mac & Cheese, and the pastas are always a strong choice."
Brad L.,"Redondo Beach, CA",40,13,4,1.0,7/31/2017,"NEVER going back. Over an hour after ordering, our server said she was going to check on the food. Fifteen minutes later, we just asked to have our food packaged 'to go'. A little more than fifteen minutes later she came back with the food. I wish I could show you a picture of the train wreck they put in the containers for me to take home.  I guess I should have been more vocal. I just have a real problem spending $70 for two people to be treated like this. I go out to eat to have a pleasant experience. If I wanted to be treated like crap, I could have stood in line at the DMV and paid for someone else's car registration.  Once I got home, I was so upset, I couldn't even eat."
Lilly R.,"Huntington Park, Los Angeles, CA",229,9,35,2.0,12/14/2017,"Im a huge fan of this chain and was extremely excited to enjoy the offerings closer to home. We ordered three apps, two mains, and were planning on getting cheesecake to go.  I was beyond disappointed -- 2/3 apps were incorrect, 1/3 had contamination (blonde hair from maybe the server). I mentioned this to the server and, though she was nice, she did very little to fix the situation and we just asked for the mains instead of reordering the apps. When the mains arrived, my dish was great but my friends was completely at room temp -- how does that even happen? We decided to cut out losses and not waste any more time (diabetic and insulin dependent..  couldn't wait any longer). We paid the bill, including the three apps that we didn't consume as well paid for his steak which also wasn't consumed.  I'm hoping this was a one off but spending nearly $200 on wine and food that we didn't even eat... kind of seems unreasonable."
Clark B.,"Hermosa Beach, CA",259,235,430,1.0,8/12/2017,"#intermittentfasting gone wrong.  Truck you #cheesecakefactory  How can you make so many dishes bad for your health but yet terrible tasting at the same time. Job well done. But I won't front, your #Cheesecake is straight tastebud heaven."
Jenn J.,"Redondo Beach, CA",177,188,1546,3.0,8/15/2017,"I'm a fan of the Cheesecake Factory chain. The food quality (decent, consistent) and quantity (big portions) here are consistent with that of other locations.  Notable mentions that are specific to this location: - View of the docked boats is unique. Can sometimes see seals. Entertaining when they bark and communicate with nearby dogs  - Parking: Only valet or metered parking nearby. For free parking, you'll need to trek quite a few blocks up the hill and into the residential area - Proximity: Close to the Redondo Beach Pier dining, shopping and bar scene While most Cheesecake Factory locations are good for kids, I don't think the restrooms here have been fully thought through with a family in mind. For example, while there is a family bathroom (yay!) and a diaper changing area, there are no paper towels to dry baby hands. FYI - Babies freak out when the super loud air blowers are on and they definitely will not let you stick their tiny arms in the two-hand drying cyclone. They freak out with full force!  ...Pretty please with cherry cheesecake on top: Offer paper towels in the family bathroom."
Toyo K.,"Long Beach, CA",120,440,641,3.0,6/25/2017,"Valet parking is $4 cash only.  No validation. There is metered parking on N Harbor Dr. and a paid parking lot at N. Harbor/Beryl. You can also find metered parking on Catalina Ave. If you want free parking and don't mind walking a tad bit, you can find it in the neighborhood around Beryl/Torrance Blvd (north to south) and Catalina/PCH (east to west).  Just look for the Bank of America, Redondo Beach Police Station, or St. James church and park around there.  FYI you can park at Bank of America after hours on Sat and all day Sunday as I have never heard of them towing during those times."
Nick R.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,173,1149,5.0,10/15/2017,I always find this to be one of the better cheesecake factorys to visit and dine at. I've been to quite a few locations around the USA. They some how have a wide choice of food items to cater to almost any individual. Tonight's server was Kevin during my visit on 10-14-17.  Look forward to visiting this location again when i can.
Albert D.,"San Pedro, CA",66,10,71,5.0,10/31/2017,"How can I say this place is so so good. Some of the best cheesecake I have ever had. The burgers are on point. Steaks are great, everything is really good. Me and my family love their buffalo blast. Great atmosphere with a great view of the ocean."
Rudy R.,"Lomita, CA",0,7,5,2.0,9/27/2017,"Ordered the the Ribeye steak but was served a club steak. $28  I've work in a meat dept long enough to know the difference.  I didn't make a stink as the server was polite and had done her job well, so here I am on Yelp."
Jessica S.,"Los Angeles, CA",11,4,3,4.0,1/3/2018,"Almost everyone I know has been to cheesecake factory! It's an ideal place to go if you're hungry but it's also appropo for special occassions. That would make sense because some of the food is so sinful. I highly recommend the Godiva Chocolate cake. It's about as healthy as walking up to a hog and taking a bite out of it, but in its defense, it is to die for! It also has an amazing view in certain places. You just have to make sure you get there quickly."
Kristen Q.,"Palms, Los Angeles, CA",211,700,1391,4.0,11/2/2016,"I am a huge fan of chain restaurants, please don't slight or judge me. Ever since I was a child, my brother always bragged about the cheesecake factory, well he loves cheesecake. The portions are humungous and so impressive! I ordered the shepherd's pie. Also at our table were orders of pasta, spaghetti, steak, and salad. We could have split the 5-dishes with only 3 and finished our food. Prices are around $15-$20 per entree, so a bit more than the average chain but they try to make up for it with the scrumptious flavors and large portions. This location is always always packed but it's because it's right on the water and fits crowds for birthdays perfectly. If you don't want to wait for a table, you can sit in the bar area (it is loud!) but you'll be seated almost immediately."
Ashley F.,"Los Angeles, CA",358,117,365,5.0,5/27/2017,"All time favorite restaurant!!! I love this place!!! I always order the salmon!! Strawberry martinis here are the best!!! Whether you come with a group or solo, it's worth it!! No reservations, unfortunately but definitely worth the wait... can't wait to return"
Nancy F.,"Los Angeles, CA",21,79,,5.0,9/6/2017,"This review is for Paolo, who is truly one of the BEST servers I've ever met!! I've been going to that Cheesecake Factory for 10 years and Paolo is by far the best I've seen. Paolo took care of our party and went way above and beyond...he knew the menu back to front, went out of his way to explain things to my family and gave us A+++ Customer service. He made us feel like we were part of his family and we felt so valued as customers!! I don't normally post reviews just for the service but in this case Paolo really earned it. He is the epitome of what every restaurant would want to provide their customers.  THANKS PAOLO!!!!"
Sarai M.,"Manhattan Beach, CA",9,161,6,3.0,5/17/2017,"Their tacos were pretty good, I'd go for the beef instead of chicken cause the chicken has a weird tang that just wasn't doing it for me.  Other that that, yea I agree they have an insanely long menu with foods that have a whole bunch of [UNNECESSARY] ingredients."
Denise D.,"Torrance, CA",126,108,159,4.0,11/6/2016,"I'm not sure how many of you are familiar with their Sunday Brunch but if you are in search of something special, give their Ricotta Lemon Pancakes and their Brioche French Toast a try. The pancakes are my first favorite... very rich with Ricotta and zesty with the lemon. I've personally tried to make them and they just did not come out the same. The Brioche French Toast is decent and huge. Both are great for sharing.  This popular spot packs a unique breakfast to be tried and tried again. The view of the marina in the morning is pleasant and you can always follow with a stroll to the pier if you are too full to make it back to bed."
Linda S.,"Hawthorne, CA",49,32,40,4.0,10/7/2017,Always good food and good service. Love the Cajun chicken Little's and I always get it with a side of angel hair pasta mixed lightly with butter and cheese! Love the ambiance and a view of the harbor is a plus.
Che H.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,17,,2.0,11/28/2017,"This is the first time I have ever had bad food at the Cheesecake Factory. I value this restaurant because of its consistency with great food whatever you order. I ordered fried shrimp, french fries and coleslaw. The shrimp was absolutely tasteless. It tasted a little like chicken with a strange texture but no flavor of shrimp at all. The coleslaw came in large chunks of very bitter cabbage and was basically inedible. The service was very good as usual and the view and table were nice."
la toya H.,"Compton, CA",70,26,70,3.0,3/23/2017,My order:  Chicken tequitos with a salsa on top. But the best thing ever is the cheesecakes. I normally get the carrot cake cheesecake but this time I ordered the banana cake cheesescake. My co-worker got a delish dish of strawberry short cake.
Kandyce H.,"Gardena, CA",47,10,1,1.0,12/9/2017,"I came here against my will. My children were treating so I was dragged.... this place NEVER lets me down. No matter what I order they will not have it available. Tonight not only did they not have the food item I ordered... The table that we were seated at was dirty, it had dirty silverware placed on the table, and after I ordered my food the server came to let us know the food would be out shortly never mentioned the item I ordered was not available. When they came to place the food on the table is when I was told they have good news and bad news.. TF!!! This is the 2nd time in 8 months that I've come and been disappointed. Then she tells me they have 280 items on the menu. Girl BYE!!!"

The staff was outstanding, professional, efficient, friendly and very accommodating! The meal was delicious. All in all, a wonderful experience. We enjoyed Avocado Egg Rolls, Coconut Shrimp, Herb Crusted Salmon, Grilled Steak Filet, Chicken Piccata and Tiramisu. Here is a video of our party:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZIv722496s&t=17s"
Jenny G.,"Torrance, CA",0,14,2,1.0,12/26/2017,"We just finished dinner here. We waited 20 min to be seated. The waitress did not bring the bread that you usually get at Cheesecake Factory. We had to ask for it because kids love it and I felt embarrassed by the look I got when I asked for it. We had to ask for straws several times. We ordered some appetizers and some dishes to share. After we placed the order the waitress asked ""that's all?"" with a tone that was more ""you are ordering three appetizers and two main dishes and two kids meals  for 3 people and two kids, that is not enough""! So I told her yes if it is ok we would only like to order what we just told you. All the food came at the same time. All of that would not be a big deal but after 10 min the waitress started showing up every 3-4 minutes cleaning the table and asking if want to order more food or drinks. She took my half full glass of lemonade and I had to tell her I am not done we barely started eating. We told her everything is fine and then she came while I literally had my fork in my mouth and my kids were in the middle of their dinner asking ""should I box up anything for you""? That was 12-15 min after the food came. We used to eat here every Sunday but their new service made sure we are not returning. We spent 20 min waiting and 30 min sitting here including waiting for the food to be brought out. I love Cheesecake Factory but this one became in the last three months the restaurant with the worst service in the are."
John C.,"Torrance, CA",4,61,2,1.0,7/21/2017,"I'm sure a poor review won't make any difference to this behemoth. It's a shame. I used to always say that's one big chain restaurant that almost always delivers a positive experience. Sadly not true anymore. Sorta like buca di beppo (what in the world happened to that place?). Even though I asked for an inside table, the hostess suggested first available as it would be a long wait. Our buzzer went off quickly then we were sent through a parade of empty tables and booths inside to literally the farthest table outside. The waiter there visited us once every 30 min or so. And even apologized repeatedly and thanked us for being patient. Which was weird because it was a Thursday night at 9pm and it wasn't that busy.  Food was ok. About the level of BJ'S. But rather expensive for the level of food which is a glamorized Dennys.  The kicker was everyone in our party had diarrhea all night. Thank you for a literally s****y night."
