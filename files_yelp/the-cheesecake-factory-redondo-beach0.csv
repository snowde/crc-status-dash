Tam V.,"Carson, CA",2,11,10,2.0,8/29/2016,"Good food and drinks, terrible service. Got drinks at the bar while waiting for a table- bartender was friendly and honest, good pour size also! Our pager buzzed so we went back to the host stand, only to stand and wait around no one ever came to seat us? We only were sat because I ran into a friend who serves and she brought us to our table (not her section or her job) Our server took a very long time to even just stop by and greet us- and the second time she came back to the table asked all ditzy and lost ""you ordered an appetizer?? With me?? What was it?? Did I put it in? Yes. I put it in"" We got our drinks at the bar, two other people dropped off water and bread. So literally the one thing I ordered from her she had forgot.. Our entree came out, still no appetizer (yup looks like she did forget to ring it in) After asking the food runner AND server about the appetizer, she finally brought the dish out (after entree was finished) and tells us it was ""just sitting in the window"". We asked if it was cold and she goes ""well I left it under the heat lamp for a little..."" We didn't want it anymore. No apology from a manager or nothing, just taken off the bill.  Server was apologetic but kept saying she had a lot of tables... Then ask for a smaller section if you can't handle it."
Brianne L.,"San Francisco, CA",1,13,4,1.0,4/16/2017,"I would not recommend coming here unless you are ok paying for Valet parking. They had about 15 parking spots but they were all full so the only other option was valet. We asked the Valet if they would let us park our own car there but the person working was rude and snubbed us. Needless to say we will not be returning and I am not likely to go to any other Cheesecake Factory based on the way their front of staff treated us. If people are coming to spend money on food they should not be obligated to pay for Valet parking. It's not like it's a fancy restaurant or anything. Based on the other reviews I've read, I'm very happy that we chose not to eat there after their poor customer service."
Giovanna M.,"Long Beach, CA",0,12,,1.0,7/19/2017,"I don't know if management has changed but this Cheesecake Factory is going, no, actually it has gone down hill. Way down hill. It sucks now. My family and I all met at the Cheesecake Factory in Redondo Beach this past Sunday (7-16-17) for a get-together lunch. We've been going to this Cheesecake Factory for so many years so I always think that the last BAD visit was just a random, once in a while situation. Yes, you have to take ""some"" bad with the good. Well, I think that bad service and bad food can be considered the norm at this Cheesecake Factory now. I can honestly say, at least the last 6 visits have been awful. Both the service and the food is lacking any quality. No joke - This Cheesecake Factory really sucks now! ~The valet parking - the decorative trees at the entrance of the valet hang low so when I drove up in my F-150 truck, I tried to go as far in the middle as possible so not to let the trees rake the top of my truck. One of the packing attendants noticed and moved the little podium, which I thought was great. But then he made a comment in Spanish to the other 2 attendants, which I understood, then they all started laughing. ~ We were a party of 6 however, we were led to be seated right away. When we were given a table right between a busboy station and the exit door to the deck. I didn't say anything, I figured that every once in a while, you need to accept a crappy table. We waited 15 minutes for the waitress to approach our table, and waited an additional 25 minutes for waters and ice teas. We were given 1 batch of bread - 3 pcs for 6 people. We asked for more but never received any. The whole time we made the best of the day and stayed positive. The food arrived another 35 minutes after the drinks were served. And our ice teas were never once re-filled. We were all over the bad service and bad food so we didn't have any desert. We received the bill before our plates were even cleared away from the table. By the way, during the whole meal - there was this 1 waitress that kept throwing dishes into a bin in the busboy station. Literally throwing them. They made this incredibly load sound that startled me each and every time. It was funny at first. We all laughed at it, but then it got really annoying. *By the way - I found something in my salad that neither my sister or I could make heads or tails on what it could be. Then 1 random waitress that over heard us talking took it and returned to explain it was a piece of onion. I know what an onion looks like, raw as well as cooked, sauteed, boiled, fried, steamed, poached, caramelized, broiled, damn it, that wasn't a freaking piece of onion! Whatever, mental note - ""Don't think about that thing you found in your salad."" We then received the bill, of course before our plates were even cleared away from the table. We paid the bill and we walked out, all with the same disappointed feeling of a crappy Sunday get-together lunch. :("
Gabriela N.,"Torrance, CA",108,102,951,3.0,4/8/2015,"Great location with beautiful view if you get seated by window.  Valet parking- eh! Kind of lame if you ask me.  The food is just okay. Nothing blows my mind. I do love their thai lettuce wraps and a few other appetizers too! When I'm craving cheesecake, I call ahead and take to go."
Bee F.,"Los Angeles, CA",22,67,108,5.0,9/19/2016,"Love the place mannnnnnn, I wish I eat this food every day but I cant health reasons of course don't want to be big lol"
Nelson B.,"Redondo Beach, CA",1,8,2,1.0,10/1/2016,"Don't bother. What was once a FANTASTIC restaurant is now a joke. The food is good and the desserts are great, but the service? FORGET it!  It took a full hour to be seated after being told it would be 30 minutes. It took an hour to receive the first three of seven plates for dinner. The manager shows up as the last plate is being delivered (20 minutes later) and speaks ONLY to that guest. He completely ignores the fact that 6 other people are sitting in front of cold food. He brings a dessert to that guest. Is that supposed to fix everything? $200 to be treated like THAT?!? REALLY?!? When this restaurant opened in the 80's it was AMAZING! As a fellow restaurant employee, several of my friends started working here. It was GREAT!! It was a gold standard. The food was ALWAYS delicious. The service was IMPECCABLE. You are now an embarrassment. Close your doors and leave our city."
Briauna S.,"Inglewood, CA",0,26,3,1.0,2/4/2017,"You know, I've always had mixed feelings about this location because the customer service is never consistent. Today, however, put the icing on top of the cake for me with this place. First of all, I knew things weren't going to go right when we got there. There was a crowd of people standing at the door waiting for it to open and a man steps out and says ""just to let you know we have four more minutes until opening"", um okay not sure why you needed to do that but whatever. When it's finally 11:30 they open the doors and we wait to put our names down. The girl at the desk (I forgot to get a name) was extremely rude and just seemed irritated, which I could understand if it had been a long day but they literally just opened the doors, but again we left it alone. So we put our names down figuring that it shouldn't be too long of a wait since they just opened, wrong! Not only did they proceed to seat 2 people in front of us (that did not have reservations) but then they came and said ""oh we can't seat you except for the bar not enough servers sorry"". You're joking right? And you do realize parking is not free? I'm gonna assume they will say something along the lines of ""we are a big restaurant and we try to accommodate as best we can, blah blah blah"". Honestly, they could've handled that a little better. Bottom line of you really love The Cheesecake Factory and don't want a bad taste in your mouth, save yourself some time and go to the location in the Marina. I have yet to be disappointed there."
Justin L.,"Redondo Beach, CA",252,41,353,3.0,8/17/2015,"This is actually my favorite CCF location because it is by the water. All you see are the boats in the harbor and not really the ocean, but nonetheless, it's still very nice.  Let's start out by saying that parking here sucks. It's valet only $4 plus tip. However, I believe on the weekdays, you have the option to self park in the very tiny lot on the right after you enter. Later on, I found out that the parking lot isn't owned by CCF so they had to pay the city money to use it and therefore, the fee passed down to the consumers. It still doesn't change my mind about how sucky the parking is, but at least I understand.  Next, please come early. The lines at this place is strangely outrageous. To be honest, CCF isn't even such a great restaurant, but this location is always packed and I don't understand. For dinner time, try aiming for 4-5 because you'll have to definitely wait any time after.    The menu has a lot of variety and can be overwhelming at times because of the many pages. Keep in mind, the portion size at this place is really big and I have never finished anything that I've gotten here. The give free bread!! Who doesn't love free bread!? My favorite is the wheat one, it's way better than the white one. As for entrees, I think the spaghetti and meatballs was pretty good as well as the parmesan chicken. My mom seem to really enjoy the meatloaf. For dessert, you HAVE to get a cheesecake. The cheesecake here is absolutely delicious. I've tried the red velvet, mango keylime, and strawberry. All three were really good!  Overall, it's a pretty basic American restaurant where you can probably find the food here at any other American restaurant (except the cheesecakes)."
Michael O.,"Gardena, CA",14,88,583,4.0,4/1/2015,"For some unknown reason, this is the only Cheesecake Factory I ever been to in my life.  The location is very good as it is near the beach.   You will find a plenty of VIP parking here, but there are also a small general parking near the right hand side of the entrance area.   My wife and I did not have a reservation, but luckily we got the seating by the window side which provided us with a great view of nearby yatchs and ocean.  Also, the staffs were very friendly and very courteous throughout our meal.   Bistro Shrimp Pasta - Crispy battered shrimp, fresh mushrooms, tomato, and arugula tossed with spaghetti and a basil-garlic-lemon cream sauce.  This dish was chosen as it was recommended by one of my yelp buddy and it sure made me very very happy!!!  Thank you, Lisa!!! Miso Salmon - Grilled salmon with Miso flavor, and rice with snap peas.  The salmon was very very tender and juicy!       Sorry, no dessert as we were too full! Come to think of it, I never had their cheesecakes..."
Patrice H.,"Litchfield Park, AZ",12,5,,3.0,7/29/2016,You are charged to park and it owns the parking lot in front  how much stinking money do you need?  Give me a break. No charge to park at Joes Crab Shack I guess they are not as money hungry. Lovely view such great food. On the Marina  Service good but seemed really busy like a drive by toss without giving eye contact. Just go for desert and leave it at that.
Maria A.,"Los Angeles, CA",71,135,47,4.0,10/30/2016,This has got to be the Cheesecake Factory with the best view in town. It faces all the beautiful boats. Its a breathtaking image. Zip coffee with a slice of oreo cheesecake. Yummy!
T Z.,"Rancho Palos Verdes, CA",2,9,4,1.0,9/6/2016,"OMG... We always go to this location with family and friends. However we decided to take my in laws on Labor Day and we got there around 12pm. I never experienced a horrible service in my life that we got yesterday. I was soooo ashamed front of my in laws. Our server was so unfriendly with a big attitude... Everything we asked for it took her a long time to bring. When we got there it wasn't busy yet so I'm surprised that it took 50 min to get 4 orders of California Omelette. And after 50 min when I asked the server why is taking such a long time to bring our food she said well you asked for cream cheese that usually on Mondays we don't have that much..um okay. She had our toast and before she puts it down with an attitude she said so should I take back ur toast or you want it? I mean really is this how they trained you here? When I asked for the manager all he had to say was sorry and our food should be ready soon. Two other tables got there after us and they ordered lunch menu they both got their foods and was ready to pay...I always go to this location, but after yesterday I will find a different place to go spend my money or take my family. Oh and I ordered my omelette with egg whites and asked for tomatoes, and when I got my food after 50 min my omelette was with regular egg and on the side with crispy potatoes. My husband asked just for a regular coffee it took her 15 min just to bring his creamer...I mean his coffee was cold already... I understand its busy but have some manner and treat your customers with some respect. Horrible service so unprofessional..still in shock of her attitude."
Dennis C.,"Los Angeles, CA",172,477,23,4.0,6/23/2015,Visited on a busy Saturday night. We asked for outside seating and were attended to in under 30 minutes. We were given a good spot overlooking the marina and it was just what I was expecting!  Entrees came out quick and servers were everywhere willing to get you what you needed. I had the bacon-bacon burger and while it may not have been the best burger I have had. I enjoyed all the food and all the service we received. I like this particular location due to its overlooking the ocean. $4 for valet parking. Not a huge line for cheesecake either.
Ayreen J.,"Los Angeles, CA",40,12,,1.0,8/12/2017,"Waited a very long time for our food, when it finally came, my son's hamburger was burnt and my eggplant parmesan was cold.  As if it has been sitting out.  The cheese had already hardened and the noodles were sticking together.  We told the server and the manager came. They apologized and said their kitchen was busy.  It was 2:30 in the afternoon.  Then they told us that they will make us a fresh food.  When my food arrived, it was the same food!!!! They tried to hide it by moving the part I had eaten under and putting fresh cheese on top!  The noodles were warmer but looks they just added more sauce to warm it up.  Don't trust your food this Cheesecake Factory.  The manager walked away looking embarrassed when I showed her where they tried to pretend I got a new freshly cooked food. She never came back. I left hungry. I was not going to eat anything prepared by their cooks after what they did.  I don't trust them! Who knows what they do with your food if you send it back, even if it is their fault.  Never Again :-("
Syd N.,"Torrance, CA",0,143,1,4.0,6/19/2017,Ate at the Cheesecake Factory for Father's Day breakfast and my boyfriend's daughter recommended the pancakes so I tried the blueberry pancakes and they are delicious.  They are really fluffy and light and the syrup is so good.  I usually don't put syrup on my pancakes because it's too thick and sweet but the syrup was really thin and not too sweet.
C R.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,137,51,1.0,12/30/2016,"On December 29th, 2016, at approximately 9:20pm, my friend and I visited this restaurant for dinner, like we have countless times before. We were promptly seated in a booth, and we were told that Antoinette would be our waitress. She had never before been our waitress. She took much longer than usual to take our orders, and then we waited for our food. As we waited for nearly an hour, Antoinette must have passed our table nearly 10 times without saying a word. After we sat down, an African American family sat behind us and Antoinette stopped at their table 4 or more times, and they received their food before we did. By the time we began eating, the African American family had already left, and I made an effort to check by looking behind me. I watched Antoinette, and she was waiting on 4 different tables near us, but never once stopped to ask us if we needed water, NOR did she tell us ""your food will be out shortly, sorry for the wait, etc."" She also was not knowledgeable, and wanted to charge me extra for a turkey burger patty. She told me that if I wanted the turkey burger patty wrapped in lettuce, that it would be considered protein style, and that it would be an additional charge. However, in previous times there was no additional charge, and with barbeque sauce.  I told my friend that I was going to wait till 10:25pm, more than an hour after we arrived at the Cheesecake Factory, to inquire about the whereabouts of our food. At 10:25pm, I walked up to the hostess and told her that we had been here for more than an hour, and we did not have our food yet. I then saw our ""waitress"" Antoinette, and asked her ""where is our food, it's been an hour"" and she rudely said ""I DON'T MAKE THE FOOD, WHY DON'T YOU GO BACK INTO THE KITCHEN AND ASK WHERE YOUR FOOD IS."" I was shocked and speechless, and then I told her ""isn't that your job?"" and she rudely responded ""YOU DON'T TALK TO ME THAT WAY."" I told her that I had the right to ask where my food was and she stormed off and once again said ""YOU DON'T TALK TO ME THAT WAY.""  It became crystal clear that my friend and I were being directly targeted, and this was a clear case of discrimination. I spoke to the manager, Aurelia, who was polite and professional, and she immediately brought out our food. It turns out that our food was just sitting on the counter, and ANTOINETTE WAS AWARE OF THIS, BUT SHE PURPOSELY DID NOT WANT TO BRING OUR FOOD OUT. Antoinette never apologized, she just walked by and gave me nasty looks. I will remind all of you that Antoinette is an employee of The Cheesecake Factory, and represents the company, and according to Respondent Superior, a company is liable for the wrongful actions of their employees. Antoinette failed to conduct herself according to the code of conduct of Cheesecake Factory, and failed to perform her duties, and went as far as telling me to perform her duties for her, when she told me to ""go back into the kitchen and ask where my food was."" In addition, she used insulting language when she raised her voice and told me that ""she doesn't cook the food.""  I will NEVER allow Antoinette's uncivilized, and hostile conduct to go unnoticed. While employees sometimes make mistakes, this was a CLEAR CASE of malicious, hateful, and purposeful conduct that Antoinette carried out with the specific intent of ruining our dinner experience; therefore. I am 100% convinced that Antoinette was completely aware of the fact that our food was ready, and was purposely neglecting us, and she was just waiting for me to inquire about my food so she could lash out.  I emailed the district manager, Mr. DeMoro, on Dec. 29th, and he never responded. I had to call him, and he said ""Oh I forgot."" I called again, and he told me that Antoinette offered NO explanation as to why she acted the way she did, and that disciplinary action had been taken against her. The Better Business Bureau (BBB) grade for this place is a ""D-"", I'm not surprised. They never responded to my BBB complaint. How unprofessional. The CEO of Cheesecake Factory (Mr. Overton) dropped out of his sole graduate degree (UC Hastings Law School). When I called corporate, some Irish woman spoke to me on his behalf, and told me that I ""chose to stay"" and finish dinner after the incident with Antoinette, as if I was partially to blame, when I absolutely wasn't. I felt that she was speaking WAY above her level, but this is typical of undereducated people. UPDATE: they cut the size of their black out cake by a 3rd, and they are charging the same price, $8.50 for a tiny piece of cake. Disgraceful! I won't be returning to this loud, unprofessional, and dismissive establishment EVER AGAIN. I can get better service and ambiance elsewhere, and BETTER & CHEAPER DESSERTS. Lastly, the coffee here is DISGUSTINGLY watery. Cheesecake Factory is currently being sued for an issue with their bill split tips. I hope this company goes bankrupt in my lifetime."
Niles C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,68,,2.0,1/1/2016,"The food is good, but this restaurant's heyday is in the past. I have been coming here with my family since the first Bush was president, on a regular basis I might add. I doubt there are that many people who have dined at this restaurant more than we have. 1) The food is still good, but the portions are not nearly as large as they were 10 years ago. In fact, in the 90s, the portions were borderline comically large. This is not the case anymore. 2) Customer service has DIMINISHED. The new waitstaff is NOT well trained. I can excuse inexperience, but stupidity and arrogance I will not.         a) Months ago, the waitress abandoned us for 20 minutes. We got the manager who                      explained she switched serving areas and forgot to tell the new waitress. No compensation or even apologies from the manager. Wow!        b) Another time, we ordered a salad as an appetizer. The waitress brought it during our dinner. We reminded her that we wanted it as an appetizer. She blamed the kitchen staff, said it wasn't her fault, and offered no apologies. Young lady, seriously?!?! And you think this is going to win you a generous tip. Last point, Cheescake factory, I understand this isn't FINE dining, but for the love of god, can you please instruct your waiters to bring NEW glasses for refills on soft drinks. It's tacky and inelegant to have to hand your drinks to the waiter...which brings me to anther gripe. Instruct your waitstaff to place the plates and drinks on the table INSTEAD of handing them to the patrons. This isn't the hillbilly hoedown."
Andrea V.,"Harbor City, CA",1,22,3,5.0,6/1/2017,Kento is awesome!! He was so attentive and came around often even when there were big parties! Had a really good experience because of him!
Shelby M.,"Newark, DE",2,13,10,5.0,11/15/2016,"My friend and I came in on a Sunday night and we were seated right away. On our way to our table we were greeted about 5 times and on our way out again the same thing! It was wonderful! I've never experience such amazing service, it was awesome! Our food came out quick and our server was incredible!"
Deborah W.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,16,2,1.0,7/20/2017,"Had a horrible experience there about 6 weeks ago. Reviewed on Facebook and received a great email and gift card. Gave it another shot today and it was awful. Please do not send me a gift card, I am done with your place. Service was horrible. Took 15 minutes for the server to take our order. Took 30 minutes to get our food and the order was all wrong. Asked for Diet Coke, got regular coke. Order no sauce on the appetizer and it had sauce. Appetizer came out with entree which also had sauce after requesting no sauce. Kids meal wasn't cooked all the way. I didn't even touch my entree, it was obvious and she said can I take this away. Never asked if anything was wrong. We used to eat here at least 2 times a month and the service and food were amazing. It has gone down hill quickly. Servers are not on top of it, manager is not walking around checking on tables, and the kitchen is not preparing the good like it used to. Please fix this and fast. Hate to see one of my favorites go down hill like this!"
