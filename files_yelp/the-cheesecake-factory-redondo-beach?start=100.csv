Jonathan M.,"Torrance, CA",0,22,8,2.0,8/5/2017,This was my first time at this Cheesecake Factory. And was definitely not impressed. I orders the Shrimp scampi. It had a funny sour taste to it. I was sure it was the white wine so I didn't say anything. But the shrimp was very rubbery. The Angel hair pasta was good but there wasn't much. And for $21 it should get you full. That wasn't the case here so I ordered the crab cake appetizer. Which was good but could have been fried a little longer. Also that stuff they put on the plate with the crab cakes like the little chips not a fan. On the plus side.The Reese's peanut butter cheesecake was very good hint the 2 stars.

Summer B.,"Los Angeles, CA",187,19,35,5.0,7/23/2017,"My Mother selected this place for her Bridal Shower which was yesterday. At first I was a little apprehensive because she originally wanted a room, but there weren't any available. We selected a section close to the Northside exit of the restaurant which ended up being perfect. I don't believe there was glass up when originally viewed the area, but there was glass up yesterday separating it from the bar area. The manager Brent was AMAZING. He was extremely helpful and  suggestive with our order so that we could have the perfect items and portions to accommodate our guest. We had a ton of different servers but who stuck out the most was Tyler. Tyler was extremely friendly, very accommodating, and overall made this experience a very pleasant one for the group. I appreciate these two gentlemen, as well as the rest of the staff for their amazing hospitality."
Hanan T.,"Torrance, CA",111,31,6,4.0,2/14/2017,"I always receive great service when I come to eat here! The menu has such a wide array of food options. I recommend any of the pastas, they're so great and the portions are pretty big.  I just wish the parking lot on the right was expanded more because it is almost always full when I come so I am forced to pay for valet."
Cecilia M.,"Redondo Beach, CA",3,20,4,3.0,1/10/2017,Well I was going to complain about the extortion I encountered at the valet but I just looked at other reviews and saw many of the same complaints. I almost always carry cash just in case but this time I forgot to bring some. Cash only valet which you find out after they have your car and keys. I was directed to shade hotel (New by the way) what did they do prior?? The ATM charged 5.00 does the valet owner operate that ATM?? Then my bank charged me another 2.50.  The food and fun at Cheesecake Factory is basic family friendly fun. Menu with something for everyone. The valet service here is completely unnecessary and therefore dampens the experience. Not to mention dodging bikes and pedestrians on the way in. Great job On the part of the City.
Diohana F.,"Long Beach, CA",120,7,8,5.0,2/26/2017,"This place never disappoints! We ordered fried mac and cheese balls, Tex mex egg rolls, sliders, and a whole lot of mojitos. If you are a fan of cucumbers I suggest the cucumber mojito, my friends ordered the pineapple mojito (which is a little sweet for my taste) but they loved it.  Sara was our waitress and I loved her. She greeted us,  got our orders right, kept checking on us even with a full house, suggested drinks, didn't rush us, she made us feel really comfortable right from the beginning. I was very impressed. Give the girl a raise =)  We sat @ the Bar and still had a really good view of the water and boats"
Cindy C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,58,3,5.0,5/15/2017,"Great customer service! Wait time can be kinda long but its worth it sometimes, otherwise check out the bar as it is self seating. One of my fav places."
Georgeo N.,"Redondo Beach, CA",2,25,1,2.0,9/26/2016,"I noticed the on my last few visits the the staff is overwhelmed running and serving a busy busy place like that. They are just not up to it. We were a party of five sitting at the little round high tables in the bar (waiting for our main table in the restaurant). We waited 30 minutes for our cocktails while watching a bored bartender cleaning his work station. Now when we let them know our frustration and the girl said basically ""yes they are overwhelmed"".   We then moved to the wonderful outside patio and enjoyed our great food and had a blast ... even tho for 2 hours nobody bothered to clean our table or remove empty glasses etc. it's complicated. :-)"
Mary G.,"Carson, CA",30,9,2,4.0,7/21/2017,"I was expecting a long wait on Friday night, but we waited maybe 2 minutes. We came for cheesecake and it was good. Dan finished his banana cheesecake and I almost finished my Chocolate cheesecake. Our server was good"
Serena C.,"Torrance, CA",120,196,202,5.0,10/13/2016,"What a difference good service makes--upgrade! Last weekend my bf and I came here for our Fridate bc I'd been craving the Louisiana chicken pasta.  I got the IPA they had on the menu (not Stone, I forget the name) and it was really good. We also got the fried cheese (mozzarella sticks/triangles) which was deeeeelicious. This update is just bc our server, Rachel, was on top of her game that night. I commented about how dark our table was and the fact that I needed a flashlight to see the menu (not joking).  The table next to us was really annoying as well with a bunch of teens mindlessly backing up into my bf w/ their chairs like they were the only ones in the restaurant. Basically, I was being a negative Nancy and expecting the same bored service on top of being next to these obnoxious kids, lord! Thankfully, Rachel was super sweet and also not just sweet but interactive without being intrusive. She was really bubbly and smiley and looked happy to be there.  I was telling my bf that I read all the recent reviews and it seemed like everyone was complaining about horrible service (on par w/ the service we received last time), but Rachel was the exact opposite and her efforts were noticed and appreciated."
Kevin P.,"Glendale, CA",65,18,8,1.0,4/1/2017,"very dissapoint. I came to this location today in first time. Ordered 2 pastas. 1 quesadilla. 1kids chicken menu and drink. Quesadilla and kids menu were ok. 2 pastas wa soooooo salty. me and my wife ate 3 folks and stopped. Because couldn't eat anymore. Both were just salt... I called staff. And asked about salty pasta. The guy told me. ""our pasta is usually salty. If you want? I can change to something.""  Huh.. im not mean customer. But pasta were really really really salty. Anyway. I told him. ""We need same pasta. But dont put salt please. Ill put salt by myself."" He said ok. And brought new pasta. But still salty..lol I asked him. But he said. "" He ordered no salt in pasta to kitchen. But it might be from boiling salty water."" I couldn't complain about it anymore. We couldn't eat food anymore. So I just paid. And left. we messed up our saturday dinner. Lost time and money... now is 10:44pm. my kids eating panda express at home. Lol Sorry cheesecake factory. I don't go this location anymore."
Micah A.,"Long Beach, CA",193,70,171,4.0,4/26/2017,"I have been coming to this Cheesecake Factory location since I was a child. The menu is EXPANSIVE and parking is never and has never been free here. The weekends are the busiest and even week nights with there always being a wait. My favorite cheesecake is the ORIGINAL. It's sooo good. Their cheesecakes are definitely on the heavy and rich side but so satisfying  for some reason, everything I have ordered here comes a little bit too salty but I don't mind since I like salt. I love love love their brown (is it wheat??) bread that they serve before you receive your meal. I've never had an issue with customer service here, bathrooms are always clean, and it's right by the ocean. If you are celebrating a birthday, they will sing to you and give you a tiny sundae with a candle in it, which is much better than what they did in the past which was give absolutely nothing and charge you for a cheesecake! Lol"
Kailee E.,"Anaheim, CA",40,4,,2.0,5/5/2017,"I've been to a cheesecake factory before and was very pleased. This however was a new location that I went to, and I don't think I'll be going to this location again. The wait was rather short which was lovely since it was only a friend and I, but once we were seated it took forever to get a waiter to take our drink orders. After we got our drinks and had ordered our food, it took about an hour to actually get our food. I ordered the Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo, which I've had before at other locations, and it was very over seasoned to the point where it wasn't appetizing. Throughout our lunch we only were checked on once and our drinks were never refilled. Then it took about 15 mins for us to get our waitresses attention to order a dessert, which took 30 mins to actually get, and another 15 mins to get the check. I was very disappointed here and will stick to another location."
Adrianne G.,"Torrance, CA",348,30,150,5.0,10/6/2016,Such good food! I'm in love with the Louisiana spicy chicken pasta! So goooodd!!! I would strongly recommend that and the s'mores cheesecake!
Celine Q.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,18,1,2.0,10/10/2017,This review is for the Special Events team.  They do not honor scheduling agreements that was made a year in advance with repeated corporate customer.  Really disappointed of the service and will take our business elsewhere.
Sadé R.,"Los Angeles, CA",13,12,5,5.0,3/31/2016,"I come to this location quite often, but recently I came to grab a few slices of cheesecake and had the most pleasant experience due to a wonderful girl named Mia. She was so kind, prompt and personable. I ordered the s'more cheesecake & asked her to toast my marshmallow topping just a bit more than usual ( basically burn it) lol  and she happily made sure it was super perfect for me.  Thank you Mia :)"
dominique m.,"Los Angeles, CA",79,258,100,5.0,2/5/2017,Had a great experience TRAVIS our server was AWESOME!! I took my grandmother here for her bday 2.4.17 for lunch.. It was a party of 10 and he took care of us w. No problem!! We got a nice seat by the window LOVE IT
Brenda V.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,20,5,5.0,4/6/2016,"Simply AMAZING! I was craving chicken piccata and I was near the Redondo Beach area. I was very pleased to say the least. The staff is extremely friendly and the food was very delicious!! This is the first time I've had EXCELLENT at any restaurant! Our waiter Rob was AMAZING! He was very knowledgeable. He breaks down the meal you choose and asks if everything (the ingredients) are everything that you're okay with. He's very energetic and is simply fun to talk to. He's is so funny as well!! The restaurant is also by the water, so you get a view of the ocean and boats. Very nice! I'm sold! I'll never visit another Cheesecake Factory again. This will be my go to from now on! Thank you Rob!  ""It's not my job, it's my pleasure!"" -Rob"
Jess S.,"Lomita, CA",5,30,6,2.0,3/12/2017,"I've been here several times, and have always enjoyed the wide variety of food as well as delicious cheesecake. However the most recent time I came I received such horrible service, it makes me not want to return ( at least to this location) at all. Our waitress was extremely rude, and would often just walk away from the table as I was still talking. And when we would ask for something she would take quite some time to return back. Ultimately the desert is what keeps me coming back, however due to poor customer service I think it may be some time before returning to this location."
Tay N.,"Los Angeles, CA",13,174,103,4.0,7/30/2016,"Why is Cheesecake Factory so damn expensive?!?It was my kid's 21st birthday and this is the place she chose, I had a salad which was really good the Sheila chicken salad however $14.95 for some lettuce! Really. Our waiter which I forgot his name had a accent maybe Russian or Ukraine not sure.. But he was excellent kind of reminded me of a Arnold Schwarzenegger"
