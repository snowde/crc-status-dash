James K.,"Redondo Beach, CA",251,26,,2.0,3/19/2017,"First, this review is not indicative of the service. The waitstaff were amazing, and that is something the Cheesecake Factory should be proud of. I would give 5 stars for our server Adrian I believe?  He was on top of everything and a real polished pro who understands that good service is how he earns more money.   The hostess station was not so pleasant, nor very informative. When we called, she could not give us an idea how long we might wait said she ""could not predict the future.""  I think if you work enough nights at a place (that annoyingly takes no reservations) you could give a ballpark estimate about how long a guest should expect to wait. I think we don't need Nostradamus to predict the future but maybe since that is part of your job,  maybe be aware of how long folks may expect to wait. Not brain surgery it's customer service.  You might know the average wait time because your restaurant doesn't take reservations, this is the worst, most annoying part of this establishment. I cannot believe folks wait so long for basically a glorified Denny's. Food is good, portions are hearty, but you wont feel great afterwards. There is a ton of butter and oil in the Scampi. Chicken Romano is good, sandwiches all good, not amazing but good fatty American food.   Inside: It is dark, a little too dark for me. And we were seated next to the door to somewhere  outside that made it feel like we were in a wind tunnel every 25 seconds when it opened.  I felt like I was in a cave with the dim lights, stone tables and floors. This could have been a much better review but the first people one has to deal with, need to be a little more aware of what they are doing and if you expect folks to wait over an hour I would try a little tenderness and not be so matter of fact or even a little bit unpleasant to folks. The place is packed so I guess it really does not matter."
Krystal B.,"Inglewood, CA",0,7,1,1.0,8/25/2016,"The food here was so awful last night, I am compelled to write a negative review and i try to avoid those. Let me begin by saying that The Cheesecake Factory is MY FAVORITE restaurant and I have gone there for my birthday every year for the last 12 years. Mistake - attending the redondo beach location.  I ordered the buffalo wings which are usually, AMAZING.. They were dry and tasted old like they had been under a hearing lamp for hours. They didn't even LOOK appetizing.  Next, I ordered a signature dish I've had a million times - chicken and shrimp gumbo. I could tell when it was first brought to me something was wrong because it looked orange and creamy more like a curry. Tasted like tomato sauce with cream - awful. I took 1 bite and sent it back and ordered nothing else.  My boyfriend ordered he Jamaican black pepper shrimp and chicken, another dish I've had a ton of times. The brown rice was mushy and WAY over cooked and same goes for the plantains - They LOOKED burnt, but were soggy and dry than the sahara desert. Chicken was dry... I normally get cheesecake but I was so turned off by the food, I decided to play it safe and just go home. The service was good and he was patient with our unhappiness  and the drinks were excellent.. Unfortunately the most important part is THE FOOD. WILL NEVERRRRRR ATTEND THIS LOCATION AGAIN AND I STRONGLY ADVISE AGAINST WASTING YOUR MONEY HERE, go to the Cheesecake Factory on Ventura in Sherman oaks, worth the drive to avoid this mediocrity."
Alpha S.,"Lomita, CA",0,12,5,2.0,6/16/2017,"There are a few times in life where a meal or in this case all the meals taste very bland and terribly flavorless ... The wife and I went on a date to this location today and thinking we are gonna enjoy our date with some delicious food , to bad we where wrong .. smh I'm sorry to have disappointed her today .. We ordered pizza , two flavorless burgers , nachos that we found had a hair in the cheese , some tamale / corn  tostadas which was ok , and some cheese cakes Oreo , basic original cheese cake ... We didn't eat much today ... we left cheese cake factory very upset and disappointed . Thanks CKF smh .."
Toni F.,"Buena Park, CA",1,35,,5.0,6/14/2017,"I've used this location for a banquet upstairs for several years, but never dined here before.  Great food, great service, I was very impressed. It was during the week, so no waiting. I had spring rolls for an appetizer and shrimp soft tacos, and they were both low calories, but very filling and satisfying. And I had their famous cheesecake, and that was delicious! After dinner, my friend and I were just chatting and chatting, and noticed nobody was around. I knew it was going to close by 11pm, so I expected them to kick us out by then, but when we left, it was almost midnight! They did not say anything negative, did not kick us out, and our server even gave me the last refill before she left! Would I come back again, of course!!"
Pooja M.,"Woodland Hills, CA",10,14,6,5.0,6/7/2017,"Cheesecake Factory is the place which you can always rely on. I have tried their food at different locations and have never been disappointed. I love their falafel salad, veggie burger and chocolate cakes. Nice ambience and reasonably priced. This location is situated in nice neighborhoods and is always super busy."
Kedra E.,"Anaheim, CA",0,15,31,1.0,2/11/2017,"Will never be back here ever again went with a party of 5 and they gave me a booth for 4 and set a chair in the middle of the aisle to seat the 5th person , service was horrible seems rather racist . Poor service"
Sd J.,"Redondo Beach, CA",1,23,2,1.0,3/13/2017,"Had a special event we were celebrating, was unable to ride in a car and so we ordered a pizza since I think they make the best pizza in town.  It's priced higher than most but it has always been worth it until this day.   We picked it up to go and brought it home.   This Pizza was undercooked and just plain nasty.    I called to complain and the manager said he would take it off our bill which wasn't enough, if you ask me since that's why I wasted my time even going there.   Anyway, to add insult to injury, my credit card bill arrived today and surprise, surprise, that nasty pizza was never taken off the bill.  Shame on you Cheesecake Factory!"
Kerri H.,"Torrance, CA",1489,638,2719,5.0,5/25/2015,I love this Cheesecake Factory that is right on the water.  We sat out on the patio... And it was great!!! It's huge and there's tons of seating. The menu is incredible with something for everyone!!!
Ivy I.,"San Diego, CA",0,63,19,3.0,7/16/2016,"I ordered a tossed salad w/out dressing w/grilled chicken off the app menu. The thing was huge! I had asked one person if it was the right one due to the size and instead of answering he just said ""I'll get your server"" I thought that was a weird response considering he works there and it was a pretty basic question. The person I was with (not a date-yes in today's world I feel obligated to add that in, ridiculous) ordered a salad off the entree side. While I loved the size of my portion I kinda feel like it should have been smaller than the entree and not the same size.  The server: Busy, but kept a smile on her face and was nice And kept my Diet Coke full (needed the caffeine, ha! When around some the caffeine is needed) The food: Great size, and looked lovely The grilled chicken didn't really taste fresh and appeared unevenly cooked (dry/tender) The croutons were old and stale The bread was cold I did notice a few tables in my surroundings getting neglected, as I was viewing the people around and their facial expressions they weren't too pleased with that and neither was I.  Some workers didn't look to happy to be there while others put in the extra effort to make the best of it. I would still go back and try another meal, another time when I have a bigger appetite and order something other than a app salad.  Until next time..."
Julio S.,"Vallejo, CA",37,4,,1.0,8/7/2017,"We are from the bayarea and we frequent the Cheesecake Factory in Walnut Creek Ca, a 5 star dining restaurant. The truth is that the food was great but the service was terrible. It took the manager one hour to advise us that they ran out of salmon and that they would not be serving the dish for one of my guest. What really did it was that when I informed the manager that we were displeased about the amount of time it took to let us know, over an hour, was not acceptable. The manager  raised her voice and responded with attitude, frowned red face and said; ""It is not our fault the person before us beat us to the last salmon"". That was incorrect because the person who did not order enough salmon for that night dropped the ball and that person was at fault. Dont know who makes the orders of food and fish, my guess it was the same restaurant manager that displayed unprofessionalism and disregard for care and service for their guest. Additionally, when they brought out the salad I informed one of the waiters that the salad she had in her hand was for my father, sitting across from me, but she  continued to ask another waiter who the salad was for. The waiter pointed at my father confirming what I had just told her who that salad was for. She disregarded my advise, ignored me and proceeded without an apology. We spent $700 dollars dining on one of our favorite restaurants we frequent, but the Redondo Beach Cheese Cake Factory was our worst dining experience hands down."
Michelle P.,"Harbor City, CA",0,4,,1.0,7/16/2017,"What happened? Cheesecake Factory has been a destination for us- birthdays, celebrations, a good meal, good solid service in a efficiently run operation. A go to, a hallmark, beautiful location.... with all of these positives, a Sunday lunch with family should have been awesome... First off, the food was sloppy, had some questionable particles, bland, unappetizing, such a bummer. The service basically sucked. When your server is gone for over 10 minutes, come on. We were seated next to a bussing station, which I know would piss people off, but no!  One server was throwing her plates into the bus bin. There was major complaining going on between employees, and it was just plain dirty and gross. The hardest working guy in there who gave it his all was the bus boy and even after he finished cleaning up after all of the sloppy servers, they would seriously just carelessly drop $h!t on the floor again. At this point in life, I get to say, ""not going back there!"" Definitely not going back to Cheesecake Factory!"
Eli M.,"Burbank, CA",0,1,,5.0,10/1/2017,"Last night was my girl friend's birthday and we decided to go to this location and it was one of my best experience of Cheesecake Factory, the drinks were perfect and tast wonderful the food was really great and on top of that the service was amazing specially there was a waiter who his name was Daniel that he really took care of us,, we thank you and you are the best"
Leilani Laisa T.,"Anaheim, CA",460,281,1456,5.0,5/30/2015,"Valet parking only. Beautiful view. The staff was very attentive and very nice.  Indoor and heated outdoor seating.  Very busy for dinner!   It was only 5-10 min wait for a table at 5pm on a Saturday.   I asked for first available and they let me know outside was heated and it was.  Not too hot or too cold, very comfortable.   Our waitress was named Antoinette and another dude named Evan.  I've been to a lot of Cheesecake Factories and they were the best by far.   The view from our table was great. It was nice and quiet outside.   Lots of birds flying around but not in an Alfred Hitchcock kind of way.  Food was good as it always is in any Cheesecake Factory.  Waitstaff sang Happy Birthday to everyone in a sincere tone lol yes,  I can tell the diff! Come eat here it's great!"
Pamela B.,"Gardena, CA",1,2,,1.0,9/17/2017,"I have been to this location during lunch time and always had a great experience,  however, today we came around 6 pm order appetizer,  order food didn't receive our main course until 7 pm. A total of 4 plates, 2 were hot and the other two plates the were burgers and fries were warm. I ended up cancelling my order.  We asked for 1 burgar and fries to be recooked the burgar was still warm. When explained that it seem like they may have microwaved the burgar,  the manager's response is that we don't have a microwave in the back, which means the the burgar wasn't recooked!!   Fries was sent back 3 times didn't end up eating any of the fries.  Horrible experience ,  I've  never complained about places I've been.    The manager was  nonchalant when we complained about our experience and said I apologize."
Steve N.,"Torrance, CA",954,942,1365,4.0,12/24/2015,"This place is always provides an entertaining environment for evening fun with friends and family. If you've been to any Cheesecake Factory, you would know that they are great for appetizers, dinner, or dessert. You can rest assured that you will always find a wait before sitting down for your dining pleasure. This restaurant in one of the more popular spots around the Redondo Beach area, so enjoy the atmosphere with your dinner and have a great time!"
Akemi W.,"Hermosa Beach, CA",22,127,93,4.0,4/6/2016,The great thing about Cheesecake Factory is there is always something for everyone!! I love their Vegan Cobb salad delicious! So many veggies and I love it. Fish and chips is done so well it's still light and flaky with tummy fries. If like fish their miso salmon is delicious. I always crave this one. Avocado egg rolls is another favorite!  Cheesecake: - Red velvet cheesecake -chocolate Godiva cheesecake - just plain is always a good choice
Faye-Lee C.,"Chatsworth, CA",180,73,36,2.0,9/24/2016,Order delivery through DoorDash regularly. They specifically let you select at checkout if you want bread. I never receive it. DoorDash said they would take care of this more than once and they have not.  Do not order delivery if you want bread and utensils AND do not use DoorDash. Poor customer service.
Shavonda S.,"Houston, TX",89,166,133,4.0,9/9/2016,"We've eaten at this Cheesecake Factory location the last few times we've been to Cali and always enjoy the ambiance and food. Each time we've been here it's typically evening hours on the weekend and we never wait any longer than 20-30 mins even when fully packed, which is pretty impressive in comparison to other locations I've been to both back home and other cities. The food is consistently good, servers are always friendly, and the view of the ocean is nice even at night time. Great spot for date night or family and friend dinner outings."
Elicia C.,"Torrance, CA",646,230,332,3.0,9/6/2016,"I haven't been to Cheesecake Factory recently but I now know not to make the mistake of eating too much before our meal. My friend and I made the mistake of ordering an appetizer AND filling ourselves up with bread before the main entree came out, resulting in us taking most of the main entree home.  Just keep in mind that all their dishes are fairly large and that the bread has endless refills.  The bread at Cheesecake Factory is some of my favorite, especially the wheat type.  The bread comes out very fresh and hot, making the butter easy to melt and spread.  We ordered the Mac N' Cheese bites which is essentially Mac N' Cheese pasta in a fried dough ball.  I expected some bit size balls but each of the fried dough balls were about the size of an apple!  The Mac N' Cheese has a creamy cheesy taste and the fried dough balls are placed in creamy marinara sauce.  All in all, I would recommend this appetizer, but maybe with more than 2 people because the dish comes with 4 fried dough balls and are pretty filling.  I ordered the Herb-Crusted Chicken which was essentially a chicken encrusted with herbs and cheese.  The chicken came with sides of mashed potatoes and green beans.  The dish was tasty but I was too full to finish the rest of the dish after our filling appetizers.  The green beans were pretty tasteless and unappetizing to me though; they had absolutely no flavor and tasted like they had simply just been blanched.  Overall, Cheesecake Factory is a nice family establishment that many people often visit for celebrations and events.  I also highly recommend saving some room for their many flavors of cheesecake, of course.  Cheesecake Factory's dishes are a bit expensive but for the setting and size of the dishes, I would say that it's worth it."
Denise B.,"Long Beach, CA",37,237,120,2.0,12/13/2016,"i love this place but this time my experience was poor. I had a giftcard for my birthday I had been saving till me and my husband could go on a date night. We finally used it in November. We came in around 6 right before the Saturday dinner rush. We were seated right next to the kitchen with someone who was training someone else. We ordered apps... the tex mex spring rolls. They  came out soggy and oily. We also ordered our food with the apps so everything could be prompt. I ordered the catfish and my husband a pasta dish. We waited 45 mins for our food. We finally asked our servers what happened. He went to the back and came out with our food. Mine was cold. Idk if they gotten forgotten or what?! Since we waited so long I contemplated should I return it or just deal with it since my husband got his food i didnt want to wait with nothing. I sent the food back. We waited 10 mins than my Jamaican dish came out. It was better than the 1st things I ordered but it just sucked to eat alone. My husbands food was salty so he didnt continue with his. i also didnt like that when I ordered a refill of my cucumber lemonade I could tell they didnt make another cucumber lemonade, he just poured lemonade on top of my ice and left over cucumbers from the first drink--lame. The manager took off the first dish I sent back. Since we dont get out much I wish our experience would have been better. We might have to start going to Cerritos or just stop having date night at chain restaurants."
