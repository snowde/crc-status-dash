Jon D.,"Redondo Beach, CA",1046,148,15,4.0,11/3/2015,Went for dinner with my baby to redeem a gift card. We went on Saturday night during Halloween which was awesome! While most were out trick or treating the streets were quiet and so it was easy to find parking and get seating on an otherwise busy evening.  Our server Wendy was nice courteous and professional. We started with a fresh house salad and bread with olive oil. My girl had tempura shrimp with flatbread pizza which was tasty and delicious. A bit on the heavy side but tasty nonetheless.  I had the veggie burger on brioche with fries. The bun was a little thick but the burger was well cooked. We finished with a seven later chocolate cake which was decadently rich but more like seventeen layers. We're still finishing it today.  Will definitely be back and this time will eat a little lighter. The only real challenge is that there are almost too many choices and the portions are too large. If they can pair both down they're fully on point.
Sergin Z.,"Torrance, CA",8,52,17,5.0,5/9/2017,"My favourite place, delicious and patio area is good to dine. Try salted caramel cheesecake, kobe burger, fish tacos and of course fresh strawberry cc yummyyyyy"
Borzoo H.,"Rancho Palos Verdes, CA",42,90,116,4.0,3/28/2016,"Cheesecake Factory is the kind of restaurant you go back to week after week because it's so good and they have so many options to choose from. They was over 200 menu items so you are bound to find something you like   The food is a great value considering the huge portions you get. The food is always consistently great, but the same is not true about the service.  The service is good most of the time but sometimes it can be pretty bad. TIP: do not sit outside at this location. The service has always been so bad whenever we sat outside.  I usually get the miso salmon with mashed potatoes instead of rice, which is $19.99. The portion is huge. One of my favorite dishes.  The side of Mac n cheese, which is almost $7. Is the best Mac n cheese I have ever had. It's so cheesy and saucy it's sooooooooooo good.  ANOTHER TIP: if you want the salad get the garden salad. It's 6$ and almost the size of an entree salad.  Some other great dishes are any pizza, eggplant parmigiana, four cheese pasta, almond crusted salmon salad and avocado egg rolls.  This is one of my favorite places to eat. If they can just perfect the service it would be the BEST place to eat."
Maritza S.,"Lynwood, CA",1,9,6,5.0,2/24/2017,"Had dinner tonight with my husband and Adrian was our server. He was very helpful from the start. Got us some wine samplers(ended up going with beer because the wine was too dry). Our food did take a while, but he was constantly coming to our table to ask how we were doing. Awesome customer service. Both of our plates came out very tasty. We're very content with our visit today. Adrian was an awesome server!"
Rosalie L.,"Torrance, CA",3,24,10,4.0,4/20/2017,"I've been here many times with my family and each time the food was good.  I love the Crusted Chicken Romano, so much so that I've ordered it every time so I can't comment on the rest of the menu. And the cheesecake! How can you go wrong!  It does get crowded and the noise level is pretty high. That would be my only negative comment but it hasn't stopped me from returning."
Sabah C.,"San Diego, CA",1,28,88,1.0,12/13/2016,Worst costumer service for pickups and take out. Staff is very rude. They are always under staff. It takes forever for them to bring out the food. All the women working there have attitude problems. Not professional at all. Never going back. Yesterday went to pickup the food. Got 3 drinks and there was two bags of food. When asked for cup holder the Asian girl on counter said. She doesn't have cup holder and its not my problem how you gonna carry everything to car...... Like really??   (Note to manager) NO DO NOT send me comment or message to go to your website and Let you know the experience in details. I can abbreviat here. Your restaurant is a big mess. Fix it.
B B.,"Long Beach, CA",0,1,,1.0,5/18/2017,"Worst restaurant experience!  We waited about 40 minutes to be seated.  After being seated our waitress brought us two glasses of water (for a table of 6).  When we asked for two more waters without lemon she brought us hot water (no lemon, but no ice either).  All of this, lwhile being seated on the patio at a table that had little to no umbrella cover on a sunny day.  The view was great, so I don't sound too negative. Food was sad. I ordered the honey truffle chicken, which looked so good in the advertisement.  It was bland and the asparagus had nothing on it. It was like food you receive with a dietary restriction. My husband ordered the salmon and shrimp.  They looked so sad on the plate, one tiny piece of salmon and about four small shrimp artistically placed on the canvas of a plate with asparagus and fries. Next, my son orders the spaghetti and meatballs, and receives poorly sauced spaghetti with a burnt (black) meatball.  When I told the waitress about the spaghetti she looked at me and said nothing. I had to ask if we could get another meatball because my son had not touched his food. She took the meatball and brought us a new one ( Too bad it was the end of our meal) and comp'd my son's meal).  But for me, it was too late. Refills on drinks (what is that!????) We ended up getting cheesecake to go, which was the highlight of the legendary ""Cheesecake Factory"".   Overall, I won't be eating at this Cheesecake Factory and sadly to say I most likely will be getting my cheesecake to go from any other location.  This one experience has tainted my ideal view of Cheesecake Factory.  They look so nice and delicious, but my experience was not worth the money, time or aggravation."
Christine C.,"Milford, PA",12,12,,4.0,11/10/2016,"I really like this place! I recommend sitting out on the patio. What a lovely view! They even have heat lamps for cooler evenings. We started with the fried calamari & chicken samosas. Oh.My.Goodness! So fresh & delicious! We had been travelling all day with little to eat, so we figured we order some pasta to give us some energy. My husband had the fettucine alfredo. He really liked it, I did not taste it. I ordered the garlic noodles with shrimp. It was pure heaven! We had been here 16 years ago when we got married. I'm sorry it took me 16 years to come back."
David M.,"Los Angeles, CA",245,73,23,1.0,12/14/2016,I was lied too they said they they don't take reservations..  I get there 3 minutes later and the rude hostess said it's a 20 minute wait..all the female hostess were rude and terrible customer service. Whom ever hear a restaurant that doesn't take reservations. ..I won't be back
Shigeki M.,"Torrance, CA",1,18,31,3.0,10/10/2016,"The food was bland and service wasn't too great. Very noisy and I don't understand why it's always busy. Maybe I'm just the odd one out but aside from the actual cheesecakes, it didn't live up to the hype for me. I ordered a fillet mignon but it came out very hard which is the opposite of what the texture of the meat is supposed to be. I'll probably just order dessert to go if it's needed."
Melisa C.,"Monterey Park, CA",218,168,67,4.0,1/9/2016,"Somehow I almost always end up here whenever my parents are in town to visit and it's not even because of the cheesecake! FOOD: I ordered the Pasta Da Vinci and I had them substitute the penne pasta for bow-tie pasta this time. They can substitute for other pastas as well which is a nice option. Portion size is pretty big here and it's often hard for me to finish what I order. You can always take part of it home though so you can save some room for a slice of cheesecake :) The Pasta Da Vinci comes with sautéed chicken, mushrooms, and onions in a wine sauce. The chicken is tender and slightly crispy at the edges. Overall most pieces aren't too dry to eat comfortably. The sauce has a hint of sweetness to it and you can barely taste the wine. Solid dish. One of my favorites when the pasta doesn't come swimming in sauce which is what happened this time unfortunately. In general the pasta dishes here are usually quite oily and the sauce quite heavy so I like to request for the sauce on the side. It's a hit or miss with this request because sometimes they get it right and sometimes they don't. When it does, I'd give it a 4/5, otherwise like this time, unfortunately it'd only be a 3/5. Overall: 3/5 SERVICE: Usually within a few minutes of sitting down, someone comes by to drop off some warm bread to snack on. It's always nice when you have to wait a bit for your server to come, which is typical for a Friday or Saturday night. We didn't have to wait too long for our food to arrive and our server checked up on us from time-to-time. Overall: 4/5 DECOR/AMBIANCE: Casual. They try to make the restaurant more upscale by dimming the lights at night and having a heated outdoor patio. The restaurant is situated at a nice spot overlooking the bay but you can't see much at night. There is a bar area off to the right where people can watch sports and grab drinks. You can also eat there as well if you don't mind smaller tables. Some of the tables in the restaurant itself are a bit small and it can get cramped, especially if you're at a table for 2. Overall: 4/5 There is a parking lot out front but it is valet only unfortunately. There are a handful of spots to the right of the lot for people picking up to-go orders. If you're lucky maybe you can snag one of the metered parking spots along the street on Harbor Drive or park by the pier and walk over. Overall a casual, kid friendly place that's perfect for parties and dinners with friends and family."
Katrina D.,"Torrance, CA",245,40,46,4.0,6/12/2016,"Never have I been disappointed at a Cheesecake factory. Parking: Ever since Redondo Beach did the street renovations, street parking hasn't been great.  Parking has become more limited to the valet ($4 + tip), or the self-park lot if you're lucky...I'm never lucky, or I'm just too hungry to wait for someone to leave, lol. Service: **RESERVATIONS ARE NOT ACCEPTED, so always inquire about the wait if you know you won't be able to sit and wait for a table** The service at this particular location has always been great, and the servers have always been very attentive.  I've noticed that the bar area tends to get less attention, so sometimes you'll just have to flag down any server you can make eye contact with, but otherwise they're pretty good.  They pack your leftovers too, and are always happy to check with the kitchen if you're concerned about substitutions based on preference or dietary need. They accommodate large parties here, and are also really great when it comes to hosting large events upstairs.  I had my grad luncheon here and they're fantastic at helping you plan and really make it exactly how you want it (e.g. linens, decorations, menu, etc.). Happy Hour:  Happy hour is 4-6pm, and they have a pretty decent selection of appetizers and drinks.  Really sad that they removed the calamari from the happy hour menu, but happy to say that the avocado egg rolls are still there!  Fun fact: portion sizes during happy hour are the same as in the normal dining area, so be prepared to get stuffedddd. Food: PORTIONS ARE HUGE...and they also offer complimentary squaw and sourdough bread with butter.  Contrary to the more upscale restaurants, Cheesecake factory offers scenic waterfront dining where you can ALSO get your money's worth when it comes to portion sizes.  Most dishes average about $16-$18, but I almost always leave with leftovers.   There's a ridiculously large selection of chicken dishes, but they're consistently prepared and yummy.  The chicken piccata, chicken bellagio, chicken stuffed tortillas, and moroccan chicken are all great. The appetizers are pretty well-sized for a family of 4/possibly 5 if you're eating it along with the endless bread.  Desserts are obviously cheesecake or cheesecake, lol.  Personally, I'm anti-cheesecake, so I can't say whether or not they're good.  However, I've dined with enough people who love it, so it's probably worth it. P.S., they're brunch menu is delicious!"
Chris H.,"Sugar Land, TX",0,109,10,4.0,4/13/2017,"Went in this afternoon for lunch with the family. We were a party of 9 and the service was great. We were taken care of from beginning to end. The appetizers were very tasty, the cocktails were perfection, and the food overall was good. We all ordered lunch size portions and they were huge - we could have shared. Overall it was a very nice experience and we enjoyed ourselves"
Harry I.,"Lomita, CA",1560,177,2168,5.0,9/7/2015,"It has been a long time since I been here and I remember that the food was really good, but today WOW it was great. Had the chicken salad and some wings and my son ( Sahm Irvine ) of all the places in the world he just had to have a burger with fries. The services was 100% great and the restaurant was very clean not too loud and not too busy. We both had a lot of fun here. I will make sure that we keep coming back here for now on. And lets not forget about the cheesecake, our tummy did not have enough room but maybe next time.....Food is great all around. Harry Irvine"
Shan L.,"Los Angeles, CA",309,303,1518,5.0,9/19/2014,"One my favorite CCF locations! There is always a wait, but usually not very long. I like the convenience of a valet or the option to self park (better to valet). The service is always very great.  Last visit we were seated in the patio area near the ocean. The scenery was very relaxing and pleasant. Our server (Nice, young african american male. First name begin with a W?)  was very attentive and courteous. We ordered salmon for my son, buttered pasta with shrimp for babygirl and I got my fav bistro shrimp pasta. My son said the salmon was delicious! He usually order fish and chips, but he said this was almost better. For an extra $5, we added shrimp to my daughters kids pasta. There were 5 tiny shrimp on her plate. For $5 they should added 10 shrimp or at least 5 large shrimp! The bistro pasta was very tasty (as usual). Thin spaghetti in a creamy lemon sauce, shrimp, tomatoes, mushrooms and arugula. I always enjoy the bread and butter as well. Espcially the brown bread (it's either squaw or molasses bread).  For dessert we had the 30th year annivesary, s'mores and Craig's outrages cheesecakes. The fav was the s'mores cake, but they all were awesome!  I really, really , REALLY wish CCF would bring back the pecan pie cheesecake. Oh man, that was good!!!!! It's been worth it every time I visit."
Myeishawifematerial W.,"Los Angeles, CA",11,10,2,1.0,5/23/2016,This was me and my fiancee first time at this one we usually go to Westminster but we decided to go to redondo beach try a different one. Big mistake our server was nice and polite she served us very well. Me and my fiancee order the factory burrito grande i asked for extra cheese came back with less cheese and I'm not the one who sends my plate back don't trust no one when i send my food back. We ordered cheesecake to go and when we got home our stomach was all jacked up glad we have two bathrooms. We won't be returning back to redondo beach cheesecake factory at all. That was a big mistake going to that one!!!
Pragna A.,"Greensboro, NC",361,226,708,2.0,10/10/2014,"I guess its a thing for Cheesecake factory to hire staff that are not so friendly and are in a hurry to go home. I usually come here for dinner, and i always feel like I am rushed to order, eat and pay the check. The waitress wasnt very welcoming and kept bugging us if we are ready to order. When you have a Menu that is the size of my  VLSI Design book, you should have atleast given us 5-10 minutes to order. She came 3 times in a span of 5 minutes to see if we were ready to order. Also she asked us if we wanted bread, i dint know bread was only given if customers wanted to eat. I thought it was complimentary for everyone. And she gave us right before the appetisers came out . Nonetheless food was OK ,and pasta was little hard for my liking. May be its al dente ,who knows ."
Sarah B.,"Glendale, Los Angeles, CA",5,22,56,1.0,5/12/2016,"We were a party of five and My spicy cashew chicken plate came with hair in the mashed potatoes. Server took my plate and said they will replace it within minutes. 20 minutes later another server brought me a pasta plate instead, took it back and I didn't get my food til everyone in my party was done eating and we received no apology for the hair or the delay. As we were leaving we asked for the manager in charge and asked if he was aware of the incident and replied that he was informed and his exact words were ""better late than never"" and he said that he is only in charge of the lobby and the bakery and that he overheard of couple of hair issues at the same time. I think that is a very bad management especially at a big name of chain like this one. May 12, 2016 at 6:00 p.m."
Shane F.,"Torrance, CA",10,12,,1.0,8/12/2017,does not validate parking. food is mediocre at best.  do not spend your money at this establishment.
Leo P.,"Inglewood, CA",3,25,16,5.0,11/9/2015,"First off this post is all about the service. The food was good and the experience was even better. Reasons why.. MARCIO D. made it one the best experiences I have ever been in a restaurant. Greeted us with a smile from the start. Made great suggestionds to me withy drink (Cucomber lemonade) my lunch (herb crusted chicken). He checked on us every 5-10 minutes, he was pleasant the whole time AND because it was my lady's birthday... He sang to her.... Who does that and had the pleasure to do it?  MARCIO!!!! He made it Tue best experience I have ever had in any restaurant. He is the man and I'd go if I knew he was waiting on us....  Great service and a super cool dude. He alone gets 4.5 stars, the food gets the difference. Lol"
