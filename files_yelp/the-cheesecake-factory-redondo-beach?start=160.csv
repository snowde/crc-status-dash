Michelle M.,"Torrance, CA",0,1,,2.0,7/14/2017,Very disappointed in this Restraunt policy's. Trying to make reservations for a friend with disabilities and the stupid manager  tells me that wouldn't be fair to other customers. What's not fair is having a disability.
Noel Q.,"Redondo Beach, CA",6,36,14,4.0,3/28/2017,"Of all the Cheesecake Factories I've been, this has the best views because it overlooks the boat docks rather than streets or parking lots."
Keila N.,"Beverly Hills, CA",5000,2051,11264,4.0,8/3/2015,"Sometimes, it's just better to go corporate because you know that all the locations are consistent. My daughter and stopped here for dinner. We sat outside overlooking the harbor. I had the endive salad. My daughter had a main course and dessert. She was happy, and that is all that matters to a mother."
Jaquelin R.,"Lawndale, CA",1,38,2,5.0,3/26/2017,The food was very good. I like their complimentary appetizers. It tends to get busy on Saturday nights and evenings. We luckily didn't have to wait. The service was great. Our waiter was very attentive and social. I had a great time and meal. I would definitely come again.

Jacky A.,"Hawthorne, CA",130,48,5,2.0,5/14/2016,"Second time here. Our real plate of good was good. Waitress was alright. Drinks were ok. Appetizers was not so good. We got grossed out when we found something unusual. Waitress apologized...we didn't even eat half of it.  (On a good service restaurant, the manager will come apologize and it'll be taken off our bill) None of that happened. Which is fine but come on!! Anyways not again."
Amy S.,"Los Angeles, CA",24,79,16,5.0,8/10/2016,"Here with my work ""squad"". Love this location! My happy hour food is delicious.  Buffalo Blast and Tex Mex Rolls!!"
LaVette A.,"Los Angeles, CA",122,12,2,1.0,10/21/2016,"This review is one I am having mixed emotions about writing. I like this location and haven't had any issue with it but today I was not happy and thought I should let it be known. Normally when I go here, and it's not terribly frequent, every thing is quite delightful. The waitstaff is usually cheerful, kind and helpful and food is always good. The food was good as usual but the service left much to be desired. Our waitress, Amber S., needs to find another line of work. Seriously. She hardly checked on us after we were served our food unless I flagged her down. She went sailing past our table numerous times without checking to see if we needed anything and I could hear her at other tables surrounding us asking if they needed this or that but we always had to catch her in mid-flight. After about the third flag down, I sensed a bit of an attutude so I decided it was time to go. We then went another stretch of her basically ignoring us unless we flagged her down. Once she brought the check, she waited until I had my attention diverted and she zips by and grabs the folder off of the table before I could address what needed to be done in regards to the bill because I was using a giftcard as partial payment of the check. Anyway, I'm not going to go on and on about this but as you can see this was frustrating as hell at best. I'm not sure if this job for her is a means to an end or if this will be a career choice for her. Whichever it is, this is a customer service oriented job with emphasis on CUSTOMER SERVICE. Her ""niceties"" were quite transparent and it was obvious she is not enjoying her job. And if that's the case then at this point all I can say to someone like this is to find your passion so you aren't low key salty all the time. Furthermore, sweeten up your attitude, treat people respectfully and in the meantime don't take your frustrations out on innocent customers who've done nothing but merely walk into your establishment and end up having the misfortune of being seated in your section.  ***The 1 star rating is for the waitress not a commentary on the Redondo Beach location as a whole.***"
Jocelyn M.,"Los Angeles, CA",939,396,2734,4.0,9/17/2014,"This Cheesecake Factory is a lot better than other Cheesecake Factory's that I've been to. The best thing about this one is the location. It's right by the water in Redondo Beach. You can sit by the window and see the harbor or even outside too.  The wait was around 15 minutes when my boyfriend and I came for dinner on a Saturday night around 6PM. We asked for the first available seat and were seated outside. Our server took awhile to come greet us. We were started off with some bread. I think the bread is my favorite part of Cheesecake Factory....that wheat bread and sourdough bread..I can eat baskets after baskets. i should definitely stop though because I always get full before my meal even comes out yet! Oh well. No regrets. For appetizers we got the avocado eggrolls. Man, these were AMAZING!! The portion was huge and we were already full after just finishing these. I also ordered a cup of soup of the day which was baked potato soup. Bread dipped in soup = HEAVEN.  By the time our entrees came out, I was already super full. I ate maybe about only 1/4 of my pesto pasta. My boyfriend ordered the Mac and Cheese Burger. It was huge and he definitely had a hard time finishing it as well. But he pulled through and ate most of it. Good job boyfriend!!! Food was good. I think we ordered too much. Next time, we'll definitely order less...and I need to learn to control myself with the bread haha. A side-note, our server was a little bit...slow. He didn't seem to know the answers to a lot of questions that we asked. Plus, when I asked to substitute the chicken for shrimp in my pasta, he didn't give me a substitution price. It turned out to be $7!!! Like wow, $7 to substitute chicken for shrimp? If I knew it was going to be that much I wouldn't even have done that!  Oh well, now I know."
Krysten A.,"Los Angeles, CA",118,308,284,4.0,5/14/2016,"My favorite Cheesecake Factory location. For some reason, I like this one better than Marina, Pasadena, or the Grove. Actually, I don't care for the Grove location at all."
Julaya J.,"Torrance, CA",0,5,,1.0,7/1/2017,"Very dissapointed at this place. Dinner was unedible. Do not  order the combination plate of steak diane and shrimp scampi. It is a total rip off. No flavor and too much garlic  overpowering ths whole dish. Plus, they only serve you 3 shrimps and three pieces of steak, total false advertisement of what the menu offers. Service was terrible our waitress Pricilla was so rude and not helpful at all. Terrible experience not coming back."
B B.,"Burbank, CA",0,31,1,3.0,8/8/2017,"Well, sorry to say it was almost as disappointing as the Pasadena was a few months ago. A party of 5, we were seated within 20 minutes, which was ok for a Monday night. The server was nice but appeared very inexperienced. The appetizers we ordered took FOREVER, like maybe 35 or 40 minutes. The nachos we're good but calamari was a waste of money, and both were overpriced. The dinners, when they finally arrived, were good but not great, with the exception of the Madera chicken. The cheesecake was nothing special, especially at what they charge. It would have been much nicer to have good service since we were celebrating a special occasion. It seems as if none of the Cheesecake Factory restaurants are properly training the staff."
Patricia C.,"Lawndale, CA",12,16,12,5.0,7/30/2016,"Our waiter marcio was amazing. He was charismatic, funny and a great singer. Without me asking he turned down the ac because he could tell I was cold. The valet was great too. We told them we were walking to the bank nearby because we didn't have cash. He told us to take our car so we didn't have to walk. I was surprised he trusted us to come back. Overall great experience.  P.S. We did go back to pay to valet."
L P.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,2,1.0,8/21/2016,This location serves fish that was cooked five days prior. Stick with frozen fish sticks from the grocery store -- they are fresher.
Dee Y.,"Redondo Beach, CA",1,73,,4.0,2/16/2017,The food is good and service is wonderful. Every waiter I've ever encountered here goes out of their way to make your experience a good one. Parking is valet only but I don't mind it too much. Wait times can get pretty crazy if you don't have a reservation.
Wil K.,"Los Angeles, CA",11,7,1,5.0,2/14/2017,"The best selection of Cheesecake that I have ever seen. Always go here for special events like Bdays and such. Have never had a bad slice of pie/cake. They all taste amazing. My favs are White Choc Macadamia and Kahluah. Do not usually eat dinner here, but when we do it is always delish! The wings are juicy, lots of flavor. Highly recommmend!"
Lisa Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",815,400,1654,5.0,5/29/2014,"I always like coming to this Cheesecake Factory. The menu has a wide variety and a nice selection for anyone in your party.  The location is pretty--it's right by the ocean, and you can see all of the boats outside in the marina.  The overall atmosphere is nice, from the décor to the friendly staff. Also, the restaurant and bathrooms are kept pretty clean. Parking is not the best, but if you don't want to valet, it's not usually too difficult to find metered street parking across the street. Appetizers: Let me first start off by saying that I love crab cakes. I mean LOVE. Whenever I see them on a menu at any restaurant, I am immediately drawn towards them.  So over the years, I've had quite a few different ones. I can honestly say that Cheesecake Factory has THE best crab cakes I've ever had. They are my absolute favorite! I am a little disappointed, though, that lately they have become smaller and smaller...but other than that, they are amazing! These crab cakes contain a lot of crab!...not just filler like many other restaurants. Avocado Egg Rolls are also a must-try! The contrast between the avocados, sun-dried tomatoes, and tamarind-cashew dipping sauce, create wonderfully complex flavors of sweet, salty, and tangy. Entrée favorites: - Evelyn's Favorite Pasta - Lot of veggies, but delicious flavor! The sun-dried tomatoes and pine nuts definitely make this dish! - Bistro Shrimp Pasta - I'm pretty sure I saw this on one of those lists of really unhealthy pasta dishes...but let me tell you, it is worth those calories! Crispy battered shrimp, fresh mushrooms, tomato, and arugula tossed with spaghettini and a basil-garlic-lemon cream sauce. Does that not sound amazing or what?! - Pan-Seared Salmon with Angel Hair - The lemon-caper sauce is really good! - Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic - Mushrooms, pancetta, and peas are great combination in any pasta! Dessert: I know we're talking about The Cheesecake Factory here, but truthfully, I'm not the biggest fan of cheesecake. GASP, I know. However, they do have a few non-cheesecake options, to which I am very pleased with. Linda's Fudge Cake is definitely the way to go if you want something sweet, rich, and chocolate-y! A slice of this 7-layered cake is HUGE, so make sure you bring someone to share it with!....or not..."
E J.,"Simi Valley, CA",659,92,12,1.0,9/21/2016,"Ok I'm disappointed ;""( we ate here today and usually every time we come it's good. But today when we ate I got stomach cramps and everything that came with it.., which started after We ate and I left ...I ate the pasta. I wasn""t going to write about it but I'm still up now experiencing cramps etc and not feeling too good. I'm not sure if I will return to cheesecake again or maybe just not this location which makes me sad because this location is near me & cheesecake was one of my Favs ;""(("
Chris C.,"Compton, CA",36,6,4,5.0,8/27/2016,Food was good but even better customer service from the waiter serving us the view is outstanding. Had the hibachi steak was delicious
Joe D.,"Torrance, CA",0,14,,4.0,10/17/2016,I always have to leave room for a piece of their fabulous cheesecake. Sunday brunch on the patio out back facing the water is one of my favorite midday pastimes
