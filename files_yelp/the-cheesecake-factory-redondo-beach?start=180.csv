Victoria C.,"San Pedro, CA",198,94,76,4.0,12/14/2016,"I have always loved the cheesecake factory, and will always love the cheesecake factory! This location is probably one of my favorite locations because of the beautiful view of the harbor. What could be better than yummy cheesecakes, a martini, and a gorgeous view? Even though this place stays busy, I have always received great service and quick seating. The only thing I don't like about this location is that you almost have to valet your car."
Porsha M.,"Bellflower, CA",1,10,,5.0,1/17/2017,Delan was amazing great customer service very responsive polite. He made sure we were taking care of our entire time.
Tiffany B.,"Manhattan Beach, CA",121,9,2,5.0,1/17/2017,My kids and I love this Cheesecake Factory. The food is consistently fantastic & the large portions are plentiful. Rob O. is the best server. We always request him. His service is incredible.
Diana T.,"Redondo Beach, CA",407,328,1450,1.0,5/6/2015,"This is quite possibly my favorite location until yesterday's dirty cup incident. I had a plastic cup of water and once I had finished my water and the glass was dry on the inside I noticed a major coating of caked on dirt in the inside of the glass. As my waitress was about to refill my filthy glass (that I almost threw up after seeing the inside), I stopped her and pointed it out to her. She was mortified but did nothing to rectify the situation except bring me a glass of water (not a plastic mug). We gladly paid our bill and left but doubt we will be back as God knows what's on the rest of the dishes. Check out the photos of the mug yourself. Such a shame..."
Kathy B.,"El Segundo, CA",48,22,97,5.0,2/19/2017,Great dinner tonight with the hubby . Crowded but a table in the  bar works just fine. Waiter was very polite and responsive .
Dara H.,"Torrance, CA",5,3,,1.0,7/21/2017,"I Came here for dinner for my girlfriends birthday and other than being sat after a not to long of a wait everything after that was down hill. From the service from the server to the food coming out of the kitchen. After we received our drinks we put in an order for a few appetizers. Thinking we would be full from all that that's what we started with. Waiting and waiting for our ""Appetizers"" for what was atleast 30-35 min we both ordered a entire in the mean time. Well after waiting another 15 Min after placing our other order we start to get hour appetizers one by one and what do u know 5 min later here comes our main course. So in that whole time period not one server or manager or any other employee came to check on us or let us know what was going on with any of our food. And right before the server dropped the check she asked if we wanted any desert we replied yes and yet we didn't get to place the order the server Ashley angerly threw the check on the table. Here we are waiting another 20 min for my change. WTF!!!!"
Maureen R.,"Oxnard, CA",246,11,5,4.0,2/9/2017,"The bread was delicious, as always! And the vegan cobb salad is always my go-to! It was unfortunate I found a piece of cheese in it, but it was a quick fix. Good service."
Olga A.,"San Diego, CA",249,101,242,2.0,5/24/2015,This cheese cake factory has a nice view and the food is ok here. Lots of options to choose from and warm bread while you are waiting. The portions are pretty big. Seems like a pretty popular place.  The cheesecake by far is the best here and today we took home a 10in tiramisu and 7in Fresh Strawberry.  Beware -They have this unwritten rule that if you buy a whole cheesecake it comes frozen. It does not say that anywhere so even if you see a whole cheesecake in the window they will say you have to pay per slice even if you want to buy the amount of a whole. Luckily the manger worked with us.
Laura T.,"Torrance, CA",77,15,6,4.0,2/17/2016,"Wait time on weekday night was kinda long. But it's in a great location with ocean view on day time , great illumination on the trees at night. Beautiful restaurant with well- trained employee and nice restaurant for some special occasion or if you wanna stop by for great cheesecakes !"
Nick C.,"Redondo Beach, CA",25,6,,5.0,8/9/2016,"Food and service is always great and their cheesecakes are even better!!!! I like their pasta there , u think it's called jambalaya pasta . Also their Customer Service is really good"
Rodney C.,"Rancho Palos Verdes, CA",61,8,6,5.0,2/4/2017,Really nice place love the service and the food is great. Will be coming back again soon to enjoy myself and all they have to offer
Andrew T.,"Westminster, CA",0,32,1,3.0,7/25/2017,We went here for dinner last evening and overall it was a good experience.  I had to knock off 2 stars because the food was on the salty side.
Cat P.,"Compton, CA",86,31,12,5.0,4/15/2016,"Okay, seriously had the beat time at this restaurant last night. It all started off with Jazmin (host) who was such a kind girl. She greeted us and even asked where we would like to be seated. Wow !! Thank you so much for asking. Then our server ""Natalie S"" this girl is such an angel. She treats us with such love and kindness her service has been one of the best service I have ever received in my life. She never forget what we ask for, she is on top of refills she does not rush us out. You can tell this girl truly enjoys working there. Its employees like that, that truly make the business.  From now on I am requesting her as my server if I had the option of putting 10 stars for this employee I would. She goes above and beyond. Employees that brought our food and drinks out were so sweet and attentive ugghh!! i love it when i receive outstanding service like this. Tho thumbs up!"
Michael H.,"Marina del Rey, CA",806,133,127,1.0,8/13/2016,"What a lousy experience. We got there at 4 pm. Got seated right away. Our server seemed to be totally out of it. The place was half full so there was no excuse for the poor service that we received. It took forever for the food to get served. Once the food was served the mashed potato was cold and my steak totally over cooked and tasted like rubber.  I go to Cheesecake Factory restaurants all the time mostly because the good has traditionally been consistently decent. However , since about a year ago it seems that every Cheesecake Factory restaurant that we go to has lousy service , the servers and the staff totally rude and not friendly and the quality of the food way bellow their standards of the past.  I hope the upper management read this and make changes to improve the quality of service and the experience."
Damone J.,"Wilmington, CA",48,30,88,3.0,3/24/2016,"I got rip off by a unfaithful Asian man, I gave him a 20 to pay for valet parking and he gave me 13 back. I asked how much I valet? He said 4 dollars. I said you gave me 13 he said no I didn't. I can't stand liars. Don't trust this guy if you go there."
Jim E.,"Redondo Beach, CA",30,622,,4.0,8/12/2015,"Decided to have lunch here on Sunday afternoon and came right at the end of the Brunch menu so the location was packed, there was a few minute wait for a table but not too long, the staff is friendly and the food is good, even the lunch portions are on the large side so you probably won't go away hungry. Two members of our group ordered the lunch Fish and Chips, 4 large pieces of fish each so they could have shared and still had some for later, Shepard's pie (lunch portion) was also very large and we saved some for later. Service was good and the staff was attentive, the location was on the noisy as many of the patrons are not aware of what an inside voice is. Prices are reasonable for the portion size and quality of food, would return again."
Karen M.,"Buena Park, CA",9,37,223,5.0,6/21/2016,Toyota has been sponsoring Special Olympics of So. CA Summer games for over 20 years. our lead has taken us to Cheesecake Factory to celebrate another successful event.
Guccia G.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,12,,5.0,1/9/2017,"I love this place, it never disappoints! I've had several dishes here, with the miso salmon being my favorite.  The starters are delicious, the view is delightful, service is always courteous, and the drinks! The drinks are god sent.  My favorite is the mojito and long island, but the mojito is what I usually order.  Sometimes there is a wait, but it never bothers me because I know how much I'm going to like the experience.  The funny thing is that I'm not too crazy about their cheese cake.  I prefer Cheesecake at McCormick and Schmicks, a seafood restaurant, and I prefer the seafood at the Cheesecake Factory!  Ha! Anyways, I always look forward to the Cheesecake Factory!"
Traci D.,"San Diego, CA",2,31,26,5.0,4/23/2016,"Back again today!  Still very busy but we found two seats at the bar. Good thing we sat here :). Otherwise we would never have seen Jessica - the AMAZING bar back, work her tail off. Management, if you are reading this, Jessica is awesome. Seriously- the reason your bar runs so smoothly is because of the girl supporting your bartenders!!!!!!  Give that girl a raise!!!!"
