California T.,"Lancaster, CA",0,26,12,5.0,6/9/2016,"I just like the ambiance of the Cheesecake Factory. My go-to choice whenever I go is either the shrimp scampi or Cajun Jambalaya. Yum! The shrimp scampi is sautéed in a delicious garlic light wine sauce and is served over linguini or rice. You can also request it be served over a bed of sautéed spinach to lose the starch calories. The Cajun jambalaya has shrimp and chicken with green and red peppers, red onions and bits of tomato tossed in linguini. I always ask for extra spice and it is like an explosion of flavor. I take turns getting either or every time I go. Can't wait for my next visit!"
Ohhee J.,"Century City, Los Angeles, CA",273,340,618,2.0,1/28/2015,My husband is building a hotel around the area so I came to visit and check it out. Cheesecake was close by so we stopped in to just grab dessert. But we ended up waiting for a long time for a waiter to show up at our table so we just got up and ordered cheesecake to-go. Strawberry cheesecake is always consistently good across all Cheesecake Factory's. Service was just really slow.  Great view of the marina.
Ty C.,"Goldsboro, NC",0,9,,2.0,1/29/2017,"Service was very poor, waitress disappeared...forgot or they over-cooked one of the kids meals.  Manager came over to apologize and then proceeded to offer my four year old a salad?  I think the look from both my wife made it clear, but we were polite and said no thanks.   Unfortunate!  Food was a mixed bag."
Brittany H.,"Redondo Beach, CA",0,3,,3.0,12/3/2016,"Came here last week for my birthday and had a steak for the first time, and it was AMAZING!! The service was a little spotty, but the food made up for any server mistakes."
Mar R.,"Redondo Beach, CA",0,88,,5.0,8/15/2016,"Been meaning to give a huge shout out to our server, Leana.  We asked a bunch of questions about the ingredients in the food and she didn't know some of the answers but she found out and was extremely helpful.  Went above and beyond.  Great attitude and super friendly."
Paul J.,"Colorado Springs, CO",0,1,,1.0,5/28/2017,Worst experience I have ever had at a Cheesecake factory. They sat us next to a door people were constantly coming in and out of. Then the waiter station that was right next to our table had an employee constantly slamming dishes around. We asked to be moved and they told us we would have to put our name on the list again and wait. The valet staff was the only department that had their stuff together and they did a very professional job.
Jenni M.,"Downey, CA",425,683,2351,4.0,10/10/2013,"My hubby & I didn't request to sit near a great view, but we got one anyway. We were seated outside under an umbrella. I wish the umbrellas casted more shade, but my husband wasn't bothered too much by his arm getting burned. The views of the marina were nice. I had only two complaints about this place... 1). Valet parking is $4. My hubby didn't want to use their services so he asked to park our car himself. It just doesn't seem like a valet restaurant. Very unnecessary. Maybe next time we'll use the meters on the street.  2). Sparrows & other small birds kept flying in for scraps.  When we had lunch here, it was a Monday at around 11:30. It was moderately busy while we were there, then when we left at around 12:30, a few groups were waiting to be seated.  The restrooms were clean. They are located at the front to the left of the desserts, fyi.  I had the turkey sandwich with a side salad from the lunch menu. The portions are generous. To drink, I had the ""Frozen Iced Mango."" It was so delicious. It even came with a slice of pineapple which I don't care for, but I even nibbled on it a little. I just wish they had blended it a little more. It was a little on the chunky side.  Our waitress was extremely attentive and friendly. She tried fairly hard to get us to order some dessert, but I had to decline. I don't have a yearning for sweets after every meal is all.  While I am not Cheesecake Factory crazy like some people I know, this location is a fantastic one. Review #195"
Chinadoll B.,"El Segundo, CA",19,84,10,1.0,1/16/2017,Jan 15th was my sisters birthday so my mother bought her a gift card for $100 to her favorite restaurant which is the CHEESECAKE FACTORY. She ordered her favorite meal TO GO...The SHRIMP SCAMPI. She also ordered me the CAJUN JAMBALAYA. Along with two appetizers and two pieces of cheesecake which cane up to $85 and some change. I don't know if there was a different cook on duty or what but her shrimp scampi was dry with barely any sauce and the Shrimp was over cooked. Also there was about 2 shrimp in the Cajun Jambalaya!!! No exaggeration. The appetizers were great and also our cheesecakes but the main dishes were not acceptable. NOT TO MENTION NO BREAD IN THE BAG????? We're regulars there. At least every other sunday. This Cheesecake factory is our go to spot because the food is always good and we live close by. We never had this issue until of course we had our order to go. I will be calling corporate to complain but wanted to say if you eat there often as we do then you know exactly how their food should taste. Which is always good and made perfectly but This time this wasn't the case. Both of us were disappointed with our entrees and being that it was my sisters birthday just made it worse.
Jessica M.,"Compton, CA",64,34,38,5.0,2/29/2016,Speedy service as usual Priscilla was awesome came in around lunch. Food was nice and hot. And had a great view of the dock. Never dissatisfied. Thanks cheesecake factory!
Lashalle H.,"Redondo Beach, CA",1,19,52,3.0,11/3/2016,Service is better this time around.  Our server is much better this time around.  Alexis was excellent
Ignacio C.,"Redondo Beach, CA",119,38,29,4.0,4/20/2016,Not a place I go often due to the calories one eats when here.  It's a nice place to come when you need a nice place to celebrate a birthday or a promotion at work when you don't have time to plan.  It's such a nice location right on the water and with a stunning view of Redondo beaches dock.
Mike Q.,"Playa Del Rey, Los Angeles, CA",0,4,5,1.0,6/7/2016,"*HORRIBLE!!!! BEWARE!!!! Bad people and bad service!! Last Sunday BrunchWendy served us, she brought the wrong food. I told her what I wanted, watched her clearly write it down, when she brought out my food it was wrong.  Then instead of fixing it she says ""I asked you twice"" huffed and walked off rude.  Insulting, and quite weird. She attempted to try to make me feel stupid,  She tried to be dishonest and come back trying to say it was what I ordered and put it down.  ARE U KIDDING????  Sadly others (7) at my table ate first and she took her time to get my order out. Most finished way before I did so I had to hurry.  I did get up after a long wait and went over to her tell her how crazy the wait was and how embarrassing it was, a manager in blue and a tie walked over to us, listened for a minute the just walked off.  He clearly did not care!  So we paid and left.  On the way out he (the same lazy manager in blue (I'll get his name and add later) was leaning over the counter and I said bye to him, and I said ""you know you could have asked what the problem was or do something like not charge me"" I said that's a bad way to manage an issue. He said sorry man, let me get your name, I said for what??  He just said ""let me take your name"". First of all tell why!  And soundly , too damn late to act like you care when clearly you don't!  I won't go back.  I am so tired of this type of chain, your just a number, not a person to these corporate types.  Support places that care.  NOT THIS HORRIBLE PLACE!!!  I"

tae k.,"Rancho Palos Verdes, CA",158,806,6,4.0,1/21/2015,"Strong island ice teas and the chicken bellagio made for a fun and yummy night with friends.   The place was crowded, but just grab a drink at the bar and chill."
Deontae N.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,3,1,1.0,9/26/2016,"This location sucks!! I was here with just me and a friend. We didn't get any service for the 1st 15 minutes. We didn't get menus until the next 20. I ordered the BBQ chicken salad, it's a great big salad with a 4oz cup of dressing and a 8oz scoop of meat. I sent that salad back so quick. This place is horrible. Location is nice, restaurant is nice and clean but your service sucks, pick it up. SN: do not sit in the bar area."
Natalie K.,"Carson, CA",258,26,48,4.0,8/3/2016,Came here with my boyfriend on a Wednesday night. We were seated right away in the patio area. It was really nice and the weather was perfect. Our server was really nice and got our order out quickly. I ordered the Parmesan her crusted chicken. It was okay but the green beans were bland. I also ordered the passion fruit mojito which I loved! Would definitely recommend! Also would recommend coming to this specific location because of the view of the harbor!

Cindy S.,"Chandler, AZ",48,5,1,1.0,9/22/2016,"I have never been so disappointed with a Cheesecake factory as I have this one. It started with cold appetizers, then the plates sat there for almost 20 minutes.  When they did finally clear them they brought out a warm salad with the dinner. There were no refills on wate or ice tea ! We went to the comedy show after and I truly wish  we would of had dinner there. The only good thing was the cheesecake we brought home, compliments of the manager. We will not be going back when we return to visit our son."
Jenn G.,"Torrance, CA",1678,1065,6635,5.0,5/12/2013,"A sweet lunch @Cheesecake Factory for the sweetest mom ever :). Happy Mother's Day! I took my mom out to lunch at The Cheesecake Factory today for a Mother's Day lunch. I love this Cheesecake Factory location because it has a great view of the Redondo Beach harbor! It's so lovely to be enjoying lunch with my lovely mom enjoying a lovely view. The blue skies, sunny day and pretty boats made for a great view. We started off lunch here with some warm complimentary bread! They bring out two types of bread, sourdough and squaw bread. I like the squaw bread the best. It has a slight taste of sweet.  My mom and I chose to get the portabella mushroom, avocado and zucchini fries from the small plates menu. I like the small plates menu because they are small sides that are like appetizers at a cheaper price. These fries we got were only $6.95. It was a such a great deal! Three types of yummy breaded and fried veggies that were served piping hot along with two types of yummy dipping sauce. The menu of Cheesecake Factory is huge! I am fond that there are several vegetarian items and a skinnylicious menu with healthier entrees that are still yummy but less calories.  One of the nicest vegetarian entrees I have gotten is the garlic noodles. It has asparagus, shiitake mushrooms and oven roasted tomatoes on top of spaghettini noodles with garlic sauce. My mom's favorite is shrimp with linguine. It's a great looking dish with long thin noodles topped with large succulent shrimp!   For this Mother's Day lunch, my mom and I ordered two classic favorites. My mom got the most popular chicken dish, chicken madeira! It is no wonder this is so popular because it is delicious. There are two large chicken breasts topped with asparagus, mushroom madeira sauce and mozzarella cheese! It comes with two large scoops of mashed potatoes too! It's one large and tasty meal.  I chose to get the lunch portion meatloaf! I was so surprised at how big the lunch portion is! It comes with two large meat patties that were topped with thick gravy and grilled onions. It came with a side of mashed potatoes and corn succatosh. The meatloaf and mashed poatoes were so soft. They pratically melted in my mouth! The succotash had a such a great flavor to it. My review would not be complete without mentioning the cheesecake here! It's one of the hardest decisions on which cheesecake flavor to get. There are so many!  My mom and I tried the Oreo dream extreme. I loved how it was topped with an Oreo cookie! It's more chocolate flavored versus Oreo though, thus making it very chocolatey bold and rich in taste. Our favorite cheesecake is the red velvet! It is just the right amount of sweet. The layers of red velvet cake is nice and moist!  The Cheesecake Factory is a wonderful place for bonding with my mom. It has a nice view and good eats! My mom deserves no less than the best and I am thankful this place offers the best variety. Every item we have tried here is scrumptious and awesome! Thanks The Cheesecake factory for making my mom happy"
