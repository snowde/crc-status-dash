Eriko P.,"Santa Monica, CA",188,424,2582,5.0,5/10/2015,"I came here on  Sunday, May 2, 2015 around 11:30am. It was already packed! Beware, there is road construction on Harbor Drive, and the entrance to the Cheesecake Factory can be missed. Upon arrival, I found out the only choice was to Valet park... ugh... $4. not including tip. I was not happy about this, but I didn't have a choice. I didn't see any street parking available, due to the heavy road construction, so I reluctantly gave my keys to the valet. This was the only negative aspect, and I later learned this parking lot is a city lot and The Cheesecake Factory must pay the city for the use of this lot.  As soon as I arrived, the receptionist greeted us with a smile and asked if we wanted to be seated inside or outside. We opted for a quiet area, inside. The overall restaurant is noisy. We were seated promptly and Michelle, our server greeted us an truly took care of us during our lunch.  The menu is extensive, and I haven't been to a Cheescake Factory in years, so it took we a few minutes to decide. We both decided on the LUNCH menu, which is the best bang for the buck! The bread basket arrived shortly after we ordered. Warm piping bread.I restrained myself from eating more than one piece because I wanted to save room for my salad and later cheesecake.  We started with the avocado eggrolls! OH MY! I could of had this for a meal. It comes with 6 pieces, and splitting it between us was easy, but I could not imagine eating more afterwards, but I did. These rolls have a crunch, the creamy avocado with the sundried tomato and the chimmichuri dipping sauce is incredibly tasty!    My lunch size Luau salad was large, tall, stacked architecturally, and beautiful. I admired it for a few minutes, before breaking it down. Every bite was superb. My friend ordered the Chicken Piccata, which looked heavenly! My friend told me her chicken piccata was ""melt in your mouth"" delicious. My salad was so delicious, I can still taste the different textures, ingredients which make this combination a perfect salad.  We both enjoyed our lunch, but saved room for a cheesecake dessert! We split the lemon raspberry cheesecake. The crust is made from ladyfingers. Overall, this is a light cheesecake, not heavy and rich. We both loved it. It was a perfect ending to a great lunch.  Thank you Michelle for serving us with a smile and taking good care of us. I am quite impressed with this Cheesecake Factory for their promptness, friendly staff, beautifully presented dishes and attention to details."

George M.,"Torrance, CA",216,124,158,1.0,4/30/2016,"When it comes to eating at decent restaurant one should have some expectations  like having quality food served hot in reasonable time . I been coming here many times without anything to question always hot food and prompt service . Tonight was different sub-par service and lukewarm food at best . There are plenty establishments in the area to patronize this one will be one of them anymore  ,for what I payed Denny's does much better ."
Najah C.,"Long Beach, CA",132,50,94,4.0,2/29/2016,"It's usually busy here no matter what time I come, but I've never had problems with my food. Everything comes out hot and delicious! Service is sometimes great, then other times just ok."
Heather P.,"Hemet, CA",36,5,1,5.0,4/2/2017,"The food is amazing! Delicious and huge portions. Our server, Wendy was amazing as well. She was quick, efficient and very friendly. She always had a smile on her face. You can tell she likes her job and the people. We will definitely be back!"
Anthony N.,"Norwalk, CA",63,1,18,4.0,12/30/2015,"Early afternoon lunch before 2 is best. Like any other Cheesecake Factory, parking and general wait time can become crazy. The food here was excellent, and our server was very attentive. Sitting outside is highly recommend. There's a lovely view of the marina, and beach birds. While these restaurants are a bit on the pricey side, it's definitely worth the cost and wait time."
Chandler L.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,15,11,3.0,7/10/2016,"The service was slow. Our silverware was dirty, it was gross!!! The food was very good."
Leesly S.,"South Gate, CA",0,22,14,4.0,3/5/2016,"I just came here for the 30th anniversary cheesecake and the blended alcoholic drinks..... :)  the best, avocado egg rolls are great as well, as their lighter options menu, and that wheat bread with butter we get as a starter. :)"
Mary K.,"Redondo Beach, CA",19,27,9,4.0,6/26/2016,"Yes, it is a chain restaurant, but I find myself here every now and then. I like the fresh bread they serve with any order. They also have a variety of choices on the menu (the menu is a short novel Lol) The cheesecake?? Even if you don't have room to eat a slice there, take one home for later. Warning: choosing a flavor may be a challenge for some! I have tried the strawberry shortcake. It was good with fresh strawberries, but my vote still goes to the cheesecake. Also, I always make sure to sit by the window for a view of the marina!Of course, the potions are big, especially the pasta...which means sometimes I share with the hubz. Sharing is caring. ;)"
MA G.,"Long Beach, CA",0,63,10,5.0,3/27/2017,"The most fun place with friends! Near Marina Harbor, can sit outside or not... wonderful interior, one of my favorite Factory locations."
Andy N.,"Gardena, CA",6,9,3,2.0,10/9/2016,"The food here was mediocre. I came here for lunch with my wife and daughter. For a restaurant that already overcharges, they find other ways to make money off of you. The parking is valet and there are only 10 spots for free self parking. There is no parking validation if you eat there. The lunch portions are not that much of a discount and the portions are a lot smaller. I would recommend just getting the dinner portions for the extra few dollars. Food was not warm and cheesecake is over priced. The best part about this restaurant is their bread."
Carolyn C.,"Torrance, CA",395,116,1434,1.0,7/18/2014,"It's crazy how one bad experience can ruin how you look at a restaurant from then on.  I've frequented different locations and had good experiences, but this would be my first time here at redondo beach. We chose to have dinner here for my birthday.  Business was busy as usual and luckily we were seated right away. We were facing the marina but it was already too dark anyway to enjoy the view. This was on a Tuesday evening. Ordered our drinks and appetizer and those arrived in a timely manner. However my strawberry lemonade was super sweet so I asked for a glass of water to dilute it. Our food arrived and everything was going well until my water finally arrived.  Our waiter, Dan reached over my daughter to hand me my water just as he bumped into another waiter and SPILLED HOT COFFEE ON MY DAUGHTERS BARE BACK! Common sense would be to deliver the hot beverage first, right? Now I know accidents happen but this could have been prevented. He then delivered the coffee anyway to the patron who ordered it! He did offer us some towels, which I asked him to make cold. He wasn't apologetic at all and became absent after he spilled the coffee. This would've lessened the hurt and embarrassment we had to endure because of his negligence. The manager, Jennifer was the most apologetic and helpful of the night as she called paramedics to check my daughter out. What a fiasco huh?!  Before this incident happened, he delivered a coke refill to our table but pretty much ran over with it, slammed it down and rushed to the next table to retrieve an appetizer plate that had been wrongly delivered. They were already digging in when Dan removed it and said ""this isn't yours, this is for another table."" He ran off with that as well, unknown if he delivered it to the correct table. I found out on this night that he was a new hire.  The food we ordered was good, however the circumstance we endured. We had shrimp and angel hair pasta: 3 stars. Crispy chicken costoletta: 5 stars. Steak Diane and chicken Madeira: 3 stars because there was a huge uncooked potato in my mashed potatoes. Lol. And my little one enjoyed her bow tie parmasean and butter pasta.  Our meal was cut short, we didn't even get to enjoy cheesecake. No birthday cheesecake for me!!!  ;(   This is the nearest Cheesecake Factory we live by and will probably only order cheesecake to go. Never will we dine in at this location again. The experience was too traumatizing for all of us."
Scott Y.,"Lomita, CA",18,135,102,1.0,9/18/2014,I had the meatloaf with the brown sauce.Did NOT like it...YUCK. Then the cheesecake BANANNA CREAM tasted really tuff like it was in the frig for weeks. Parking really small.I know i will NOT come back.
Anna C.,"Palos Verdes Peninsula, CA",5,49,9,4.0,9/16/2016,"This place seems always pretty consistent with the food and dessert! I have never had to send anything back, or complain about food or service. However, a manager was running the cheesecake counter and failed to help or direct the growing line. That was pretty frustrating since I've never use their dessert counter before. This location is good for groups of people, ocean views, sunsets, and good food."
sajid v.,"Redondo Beach, CA",18,79,32,5.0,11/8/2015,"I've been coming to the restaurant for over 20 years and so why the review now, well, we have never had a server that took care of us as well as Adrian did.  We are a family of 15 that came in here for a late lunch, 8 adults and 7 kids and Adrian was absolutely awesome, took care of us wonderfully and with patience. Everything was perfect and on time. Thank You Adrian for everything and making out experience a pleasure."
Angela W.,"Long Beach, CA",138,33,17,5.0,12/24/2015,Every meal I've had has been delicious & more than enough left over for a snack later. Definitely one of my favorite restaurants. The service is always excellent & no matter who I'm with we have a great time in a great atmosphere.
Gregory B.,"Culver City, CA",32,21,12,3.0,8/18/2016,Food was alright I had the chick chipotle pasta. It wasn't the most amazing dish. The setting was really nice as the sun was going down but other than that it was so so. The server was a cool person but he wasn't really prompt.
Just Ki ..,"Los Angeles, CA",6,53,47,4.0,8/12/2015,"I visited on 7/30/15. All of the servers&staff were pleasant. They checked on me in a timely manner&all. They were very professional. I always get The Strawberry Cheesecake&decided to try The Red Velvet one since it was Nat'l Cheesecake Day. It was delicious! Also for Happy Hour, one can't go wrong w/The Cosmo!"
Adriana L.,"Carson, CA",92,16,17,2.0,8/3/2015,"Let me start off by saying I'm easy to please when it comes to waiter service.  parking was horrible! yes, I know its the beach by the harbor but I mean come on! your going to turn your entire parking lot to valet only? seriously?  the wait took FOREVER and this was on a Thursday!  we ordered   Pineapple Mojito DELICIOUS!  mushroom and zucchini fries. chicken mediera steak diane all were delicious except for mushroom & zucchini fries reason being....... The food came out before the appetizer! MY NUMBER ONE PET PEEV  Our waitress came by and apologized , asked if we still wanted the appetizer? NO, not really, no need now. She responds with another apology and says she will speak with her manager to see what they can do. she comes by again and totally disregards no appetizer. um, ok........... This wouldn't have been such a big deal if we weren't waiting on refills .... THE BILL the appetizer we never received, the one she was going to speak to her manager about....IT WAS ON THE BILL. HORRIBLE."
RJ A.,"Carson, CA",135,20,18,4.0,8/10/2015,"I love the location of this Cheesecake Factory, very calm and relaxing, especially since it's basically on the beach. I recommend sitting outside, especially on a beautiful day. You get a view of the ocean, which is stunning. Our server Axl Dean was great. He didn't rush us and was very attentive. I was overwhelmed by the menu, so he recommended the Crispy Chicken Costoletta and it was delicious. It comes with asparagus and mashed potatoes, but I substituted the mashed potatoes for french fries and the asparagus seemed over cooked. The dish was great. My favorite part was the lemon sauce, terrific. The entire experience was great, however there is one down side. There is only valet parking. If you don't want to do valet, you have to park outside at the meters. Valet is $4. Overall, it was a great experience and I would come back! P.S. Get the Red Velvet Cheesecake, it is the bomb!"
