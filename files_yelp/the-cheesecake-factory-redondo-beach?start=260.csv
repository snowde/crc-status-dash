Lauren M.,"Redondo Beach, CA",183,97,99,4.0,9/19/2014,"Came here for dinner tonight before my brother goes back to college. There was a good amount of people waiting outside, but the wait was only 15 minutes, so they were quickly seating people.  The location is very nice (sitting on the ocean), but the free parking is very limited, so bring some quarters for the meters across the street.  Our waitress was friendly and although very busy, she was attentive and helpful.  The appetizer/complimentary bread is very good. I really like the brown with the oats. The texture is so soft and chewy, with a slight sweetness. Tasted fresh and was perfectly warm when they brought it out.  The menu is huge and many items aren't the greatest for you, so I definitely appreciate all the Skinnylicious items they offer.  I decided to get the skinny lemon garlic shrimp, which is served with angel hair pasta and asparagus. I got the sauce on the side and only added a part of it to my dish. It was very flavorful and the shrimp was cooked nicely. I would definitely get that again. A bit expensive for the amount, but it was quality.  My whole family really enjoyed their meals as well. My mom said the skinny turkey and avocado sandwich was really good and was surprised that it was under 590 calories.  For dessert we ordered the Kalua and the Craig's carrot cheesecake. Both were delicious! A definite cheat day, but we enjoyed every bite of it."

Kyung E.,"Gardena, CA",354,285,923,4.0,9/23/2013,"Came on a BUSY Saturday evening. We were asked if we wanted wait for an outside/inside table, or if we wanted to just take first available. We opted to just take whatever, because we were in a hurry. Plus, the weather was nice, if we were inside or outside, it really would not matter. We waited maybe five or ten minutes, and were seated in a nice booth towards the back of the restaurant. It was really busy, so I was surprised we got seated so quickly. The service was super fast and friendly. My bf was wearing a chive shirt, and one of the managers came over and said ""chive on!"" and said dessert was on her. Cool random act of kindness... I got my faves. Louisiana Chicken pasta and tex mex egg rolls. I have tried many dishes at cheesecake, but these two, I always go back to.  The pasta is bow tie, in a light, yet flavorful, slightly spicy Cajun style sauce. It is topped with 4 thin chicken cutlets that have been breaded with panko and expertly fried. This dish never lets me down.  Tex mex egg rolls are a delish combo of chicken, corn, black beans, rolled into a wonton wrapper, then fried, and served with a creamy avocado sauce! My bf LOVED the sauce. It is kind of addicting, and I've often wondered how they make it. Must google that after I finish this review.  BF ordered the Kobe burger. By the time we had our drinks and appetizers, he was pretty full, but the burger isn't too over the top. He was able to finish everything (except for the fries) and I boxed most of mine to-go. I think it was a perfect meal before our big Saturday night. I will definitely be coming back!"
Christina M.,"Gardena, CA",29,136,185,4.0,9/28/2015,Loved this location. Its valet only. Its such a huge returant. More than enough room at the bar with seating tables. I usually go to the Marina one - but this one is so much more roomier. Food was great and service was good and quick for a Friday night.
Dexter F.,"Hermosa Beach, Los Angeles, CA",0,7,1,1.0,9/25/2015,"So i ate dinner here on 9/24 thursday.  Food wasnt terrible, server was not spectacular either but i digress.  I just had a simple spaghetti and meatballs, which i only ate half, they give such a huge serving.  The sauce seems like they just pureed a few tomatoes and added some freshly diced tomatoes and heated it, that was a negative.  I had to take it home.  So on 9/25, the next day, i try to eat the left overs, which is not bad since the sauce is not so watery now.  I cant believe its better a day old...  hahah.  Anyways the reason im putting this review is that one of the meatballs is a sponge.  I am hoping its just a piece of bread balled up.  Becuase i am not a fan of getting a small bowel obstruction.  Im going to try to add a photo of it.  The cooks, and who ever does the prep are terrible letting this go by and get served."
Samantha R.,"Torrance, Los Angeles, CA",6,10,3,4.0,6/6/2016,"I come here a lot with my boyfriend we always order their Long Island Iced Teas which are strong and delicious. I also always get the skinny lettuce wrap tacos, Asian style and they are like 7 bucks and really delicious. We also always get a slice of cheesecake to take home which are always amazing. The only tip i have is if you order a whole cheesecake to go, they come frozen, not fresh. Order individual slices if you want cheesecake that tastes good."
Mike M.,"NORTH HOLLYWOOD, CA",80,185,130,4.0,9/16/2014,"The food was really good, I'm not a big fan of the cheesecake factory restaurants but this one was good. The food had great flavor and the drinks the bartender recommended were simply amazing. They both were made with berries and peach, I forgot the names of the drinks but I will post a picture of them and if interested  in purchasing them just show them the pic and hope that helps. As far as the food goes I got myself the bbq pulled pork burger and I loved it. My girlfriend got the oramge chicken nothing special but good. The oreo cheecake however hit the spot, a must try. As far as all cheesecakes factories go this probably is my favorite, mostly because service was good and food did not dissapoint."
Wayne Y.,"Redondo Beach, CA",0,33,1,2.0,11/29/2016,"My family went to this Cheesecake Factory to have a birthday lunch for my son this past weekend. First the positives: We went at around 2pm and there was no wait for our party of five. The server came promptly and took our drink orders. Now the negatives: there is no self-park option. Vaiet parking costs $4 and there is no choice but to use it even if there are ample spaces available. The server took our appetizer orders which took a very long time to come out. The bread basket provided us was not full (it was short a few pieces), maybe the server thought that since we were ordering appetizers, we didn't want as much bread? That should still be our choice, right? Finally, the food came but I have to say, the quality of the food did not seem as good as it once was. It all looked and tasted like the food was micro-waved and not freshly prepared. For example, the buffalo wings were soggy and tasted like those you purchase in bags at the supermarket. My son's angel hair pasta was overcooked and my daughter's and my entrees were overladen with mashed potatoes with the meat portion seemingly undersized. The price point of the menu should translate to better quality. The server did not come back to our table for a long time to check if everything was ok and whether we needed refills for beverages.  Cheesecake Factory used to be known for good quality food and large portions for sharing which justified the higher prices but recently, the focus seems to be more on the ""Factory"" part of the name - emphasis more on getting large parties in and out as fast as they can. Finally, on the bill, restaurants now often calculate the tip for you so you don't have to so the math. And it would be useful but this Cheesecake Factory starts its suggested tip at 22 percent! and scales up to 25%! Is this to catch unsuspecting foreign tourists who do not know what the usual tipping practices in this country are? I found this somewhat disingenuous. All in all, this Cheesecake Factory experience indicated to me that it is a place for a group to be able to gather and enjoy each others' company if food quality and service are not the highest priorities."
Karen V.,"Redondo Beach, CA",12,95,353,5.0,9/13/2015,Darline Z was a great waitress. Any questions we had she had an answer for. That is fantastic because it makes it easier to figure out what you want to order. The veggie burger off the skinny menu was tasty as well as the salad . Make sure to call ahead to check the wait time.
Judy V.,"Wilmington, CA",5,88,57,4.0,1/13/2016,"Ok so its been awhile since I've been here & it's still delicious. We ordered the eggroll sampler, our favorites were the avocado & tex mex rolls.  I ordered the chicken madeira and steak diane it was delicious & not dry at all. Hubby got the parmesan herb crusted chicken which was just okay, nothing major.  We also got a slice of lemon raspberry cream cheesecake which was the bomb! Customer service was great as well.  Valet only & its cash only. Down side they don't have a ATM near by, had to walk down the street to a nearby hotel :/"
Randy B.,"Westlake Village, CA",4983,2338,4473,4.0,5/30/2014,"Expectations always met; great patio; great drinks; great big portions.  You can't beat it.  You know what you're going to get.  (PS.  As Yelp'ers, we like a little mystery and tend to go to boutique places) * Bread & Butter: It's free!  Amazing and usually warm, a dark bread (like squaw) and a baguette.  More please!?! * Large menu / large food: Pages and pages of selections, and always leftovers.  Each plate is 2-3 portions.  My favs: Chinese Chicken Salad, Cajun Jambalaya Pasta, Famous Factory Meatloaf, Chicken and Biscuits, Orange Chicken, Chicken Marsala and Mushrooms.  Ultimate favorite?  Bang Bang Chicken & Shrimp. * Great appetizers: Try the Parmesan-Garlic Cheese Bread, Avocado Eggrolls, Tex Mex Eggrolls, Ahi Carpaccio, and the Fried Calamari.  I nearly like the apps more than the food. * Cheesecake: galore!  My favs are: Carrot Cake Cheesecake, White Chocolate Raspberry Cheesecake, Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake Cheesecake , Adam's Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple Cheesecake, Snickers Bar Chunks and Cheesecake, but my absolute fav, Dutch Apple Caramel Streusel Cheesecake.  (note: I repeated the word ""Cheesecake"", because I can't get enough of it.  Cheesecake!) =========================== What makes this location unique? =========================== * Wonderful patio: Overlooking part of the marina, views of boats on the water is fantastic.  Second only to the Marina Del Rey location. * Service: always nice, always well-trained.  Maybe a little hard to flag down because they cover a wide area, especially if on the patio (walking to/fro), and are busy. * Valet parking: required for the lot, unless you want to do meter parking on the street which is 24/7. * The wait: While you may have a little bit of a wait, it's worth it."
Ben D.,"Southgate, MI",28,94,29,5.0,11/23/2014,This is a place that I try to visit when here in Hermosa Beach. I love the menu especially the cheesecakes. There is such s variety of foods and the view is awesome.  Just make sure you save room for the portion of food you consume. The portion sizes are probably for two. They also offer lunch portions on most if not all of their foods.  I always love the Chicken Romano (lunch portion of course). I also get the beef sliders and Mac and cheese balls. My favorite cheesecake is the Tuxedo cheesecake.  Above all be sure you exercise before you come here this will most likely take up most if not all of your calories for they day.
Jeff M.,"Redondo Beach, CA",0,15,,3.0,8/20/2016,"DO NOT ORDER STEAK HERE. They are not a Steak Restaurant. Twice in a row they did my Steak very very poorly. However, other dishes are good as my family say so. Service is good and the staff is nice. Steaks are horrible."
Nicole B.,"Santa Monica, CA",724,576,391,5.0,7/24/2014,"I really like this location, it is probably one of my faves. I NEVER have any problems with customer service when I visit the cheesecake factory, in any city, and I think that speaks volumes of the chain. The CF has a huge menu and EVERYTHING is appetizing. You can almost never go wrong, unless you go and order something that you are not used to eating. Parking is always hectic here, and I believe that it is solely vallet parking on the weekends."
Marco S.,"Gardena, CA",1,24,7,2.0,9/13/2015,The rib eye was melt in your mouth good :) unfortunately the fries that come with it sucked to say the least. I mean McDonalds produces better fries. And last but not least I was very disappointed to find out they serve a low quality ketchup!!! I mean a place like this needs to serve Heinz ketchup and nothing else. Cheese cake factory quit being cheap with it! We can taste the cheap KETCHUP!!!!!!!
L F.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,87,329,4.0,7/29/2016,"Had lunch here June 2016. Great service, great food and great views. Remember to leave room for dessert!"
Jessica F.,"Carson, CA",66,28,24,4.0,8/10/2016,First off let me say that Natalie is awesome! Such a sweetheart :) she has a fantastic attitude and a smile to match. She was very helpful guiding me towards ordering a cocktail and she gave her honest opinion on the house cocktails which I really appreciated. She was prompt in greeting myself and my guest (we arrived separately) and she took our entree orders in a timely fashion. The bread service took a bit of time to come out but I'm guessing that's because they had just reached their peak hour of guests arriving. Our food was great (grilled fish tacos and smokehouse burger) and she was kind enough to ask us if we wanted our desserts for here or to go. We actually did want them to go so I was happy I didn't have to ask for that. I tried the 30th anniversary cheesecake and while it was okay it kind of paled in comparison to some of their other dessert selections. Other than that overall it was a great experience! One suggestion that I would make is for you guys to either install your own atm because your valet only accepts cash or to have some kind of system that accepts credit or debit cards outside. Especially when 95 percent of your parking lot is for valet. Also keep Natalie happy because she is awesome :)
Chris P.,"Riverside, CA",122,61,7,4.0,3/22/2016,"Went with a few friends for dinner around 11pm last week. There is plenty of parking spots available and valet parking is also available at the price of $4. There were tons of people that saturday night. Service was relatively fast. We chose to sit outside and they did have a bunch of heaters outside so the cold wasn't an issue. However, it was a bit on the pricey side. Would go again but not often. Food was pretty decent as well."
Mike B.,"San Pedro, CA",416,452,1851,3.0,5/1/2014,"Don't really wanna slam the place, (hence the three stars), but... When we arrived, we decided to sit in the bar area because of the wait time we were presented with at the front. Service here was slow. I mean S.L.O.W., slow.  Slow, slow, slow, slow, slow... I believe it was partly because our server was relatively inexperienced. Nice kid... I mean really nice, but obviously he was new and the bad part of it was, the Cheesecake Factory management team either didn't recognize it or they just didn't seem to want to provide him any support. Even though there were many other employees in the area, serving other customers. Seriously, it felt like we were part of a ""stress test"" in a Bar Rescue episode!!! One of the dinner orders was incorrect, (maybe it was the noise in the area), which resulted in my daughter waiting an additional 30 minutes for her meal, (can you say COMP?), and our dessert order was incorrect as well. Bottom line... got there at 7:00ish and didn't get to pay our check until ~9:35... That was a couple drinks, an appetizer, 4 small meals and a desert order. Nearly 3 hours!!! While we don't frequent the joint, we've been here before and have always been satisfied with the quality of the food, the service and the overall value. We're hoping this was an anomaly..."
Steve M.,"Redondo Beach, CA",185,30,17,5.0,6/16/2016,"Happy hour is amazing, but even better was our waitress Leanna. They were slammed with high school graduation dinners and Leanna didn't miss a beat. Kept her cool and did an amazing job making this a great evening for all of us."
