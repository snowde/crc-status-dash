Micky M.,"New York, NY",6,83,56,3.0,7/8/2016,Lovely location by the waterfront. Very diverse menu that could please any palate. The portions are huge. My friend and I both had delicious falafel salads. Too bad that my friend found a bug in hers. The management did not charge for our salads and offered us free cheesecake for desert. Still had to take off a star for this mishap. Out-of -this-world cheesecakes!!
Jennifer H.,"Torrance, CA",71,204,382,2.0,7/3/2013,"If you don't want to pay for valet parking, get there as early as you can. There's about 15 spaces for non valet and about 100 for valet.  I got a lunch pasta dish with chicken and basil. My bf got breakfast. I should have gotten breakfast. The bottom of my pasta bowl was swimming in butter, and the pasta as a whole wasn't anything special. We ordered the oreo cheesecake which was really rich and chocolate-y (yum!). The service we received was great! Our waiter was really nice and made sure everything with us was okay and that we had ample shade (we sat outside and she helped move an umbrella to better cover us.) We called to make reservations before they opened. They told us we could make a reservation between 10 (when they opened) and 11. So we said okay, and asked how busy they expect to be at noon. They repeated that they opened at 10 and we could make a reservation then. We repeated our second question. They repeated their answer. WTF guys. We weren't asking for reservations anymore!  But four times a charm! We got our answer after a short OHH!"
Adam B.,"Rolling Hills Estates, CA",81,48,22,4.0,11/12/2014,"This location is one of the ones I've been coming to for a long time. The food is always great, with a novel for a menu to find something for all appetites. If you can't resist you must try a cheesecake of course. I get the Louisiana Chicken pasta almost every time, if your a pasta lover then you must try!  The dining area is massive, with a bar, outside, and multiple inside sections. It's located next to the harbor and has a great view for those sections near the windows.  The servers are all usually friendly, fast, and all around good customer service."
DONNA P.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,68,56,1.0,5/8/2016,"Came for Mother's Day brunch had reservations still waited for a table , mind u we had 7 kids under 12 that were hungry !!! The manager summer came and sat us right away , ok so we ate and an hour into it we get our bill REALLY were not even done so we pay and never saw our server again it's ok we're not thirsty well just drink out spit !!!! Found summer again and she helped us if it wasn't for her we were going to walk out this was my first and last time for brunch here next year we'll stick to ports o call like we've been going to !!!!"
Bianca K.,"Houston, TX",66,268,,4.0,9/20/2014,"Food at the Cheesecake Factory is pretty much the same no matter which restaurant you visit unless you happen to visit a really bad location! I've eaten at locations in Houston, Dallas, Denver, Las Vegas, San Diego, Los Angeles, and San Francisco and always know that I will get huge servings and delicious cheesecake, if I've left enough room and not filled up on the bread!  The Redondo Beach location stands out in my mind simply because of the location! The restaurant is located right on the marina and if you're lucky enough to score on of the tables in the patio area you'll get to dine with a nice view, a breeze and the sound of sea lions! I've never had to wait for a table although I've only ever eaten here at lunch time, I'm sure the dinner hours would be much busier! Easiest way to park in the area is to use the restaurants valet although it will cost you $2.50 before tip."
Teresa M.,"Huntington Park, CA",0,23,49,5.0,8/3/2016,I always enjoy my visits here. Not a fan of the cheesecakes but definitely love the food! Their customer service is great! My favorite plate Hibachi steak it is Heavenly! Totally recommend this is a great restaurant for a date the ambiance at dinner is very mellow and lovely!
Eileen T.,"Carson, CA",91,11,18,5.0,6/23/2014,"My all-time favorite! I have chosen this place for my birthday dinners several times already. Service never fails and so many good food options to choose from.  I highly suggest trying their herb crusted filet of salmon, fettuccine alfredo (also good w/ sun dried tomatoes - something I recently tried!), & their farfalle pasta. For dessert, I recommend the red velvet cheesecake & the chocolate tuxedo cream! Oh and can't forget about their fresh whole wheat bread & butter! Mmm.. definitely starts off the meal just right!  This particular location also has a great view of the beach/port so you can choose to eat outside on a nice, sunny day and enjoy the view :)"
Julia C.,"San Francisco, CA",9,3,2,2.0,8/2/2015,The location is perfect and the view from our table was beautiful. The service was poor and we waited for about 10 minutes before we could order drinks and food. We sat by the window and it was really cold and I usually don't feel cold at all. Our food were good. I ordered Farafalle with chicken and garlic and it was delicious. My mother usually orders the Chicken Avocado club and it was a disappointment. The dish is fantastic anywhere else but apparently not here. The rest of my family liked the food but nothing was extraordinary. It took 10 minutes after we all had finished before our server came and got us the check and cleaned the table. Those 10 minutes was not pleasant since we all were very cold and just wanted to get out of there.
Mike A.,"Gardena, CA",0,11,8,1.0,7/26/2015,"worst experience ever. I have been coming here and it was fine before.  but today the service and the food was awful.  calamari was a bit salty,  ordered a chicken salad sandwich but got a club sandwich.  order took forever,  forgot the lemon on the water and ordered a steak and chicken Madeira combination and I received the smallest portion ever. I was never asked if I wanted rice,  fries,  salad or mashed potato.  it arrived with ""mashed potato"" and it's more like a potato salad.  the worst dining experience ever!"
Yatese T.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,30,8,4.0,1/27/2016,Seated pretty quick on a busy night. The waitress was kinda hard to flag down and seemed a bit overwhelmed. I ordered the calamari it was just delicious not too hard not to chewy. I had the orange chicken with red velvet cheese cake for desert. Omg the red velvet was so sweet me and my boyfriend couldn't finish it. The orange chicken was pretty good. The food is always good quality. Vallet people are pretty quick and friendly.
Irene D.,"Lawndale, CA",2,13,8,5.0,3/21/2016,My husband and I enjoyed our dinner tonight at the cheesecake factory it was excellent and the waitress was really nice
Brian B.,"Redondo Beach, CA",1,9,1,1.0,2/23/2016,"Once our favorite spot to bring our Foreign Visitors for a Lovely Experience on the Harbor at Redondo Beach. Prior to this visit, it has been a no-brainier, Cheesecake Factory pleases where ever you go.  Unfortunately, this location must be under new management, or the Waiting and Cook Staff needs a New Supervisor, because this place has let go of their usual high standards! Whatever the problem is, there is NEVER ANY REASON TO BE RUSHED TO ORDER AS SOON AS ONE SITS DOWN?? THEN AFTER BEING SNUBBED FOR 20 minutes , FOR NOT BEING READY? THEN  HAVE EVERYTHING DUMPED AT THE TABLE.... WATER, DRINKS, BREAD, APPETIZERS AND MAIN COURSE AT THE SAME TIME..! With an attitude as to asking them why?? Why this was happening??? What a JOKE..! We are not prudes here, nor do we expect special treatment. Just your low-key Redondo Beach Locales. We Just want the norm, a possible smile, Time to Look at the TWENTY PAGE MENU....YES!? And a reasonable relaxed environment to enjoy ourselves, and leisurely eat some good food. We were so embarrassed to think this place would impress some special guests. Of course they judge this as the Norm for an American Experience.....just OMG! Being possibly they had been busy, short handed, or training was going on might have been the case the last two visits. Sorry, not being nasty here, as it seemed none of the above was the case. It was not that busy, and quite a few empty tables with waiting staff manager wandering around texting and ignoring the whole affair. Unfortunately, this time and the time before, in 2016, The food was simply awful, like Entree Salads, how hard is it? Lacking an dressing, spoiled tomatoes? The other, Shepard's Pie, just is AWFUL now...! Before this visit, the other disaster,  it was a simple chicken dish and pizza, was a joke...just slop....what the hell? What is going on? What ever is the problem, Management, the waiting staff, and food prep, servers all are either pathetically undertrained, or just do not care. Simply put, just rude, impatient young folk, that do not care, that reflects a WE DON""T CARE IMAGE for the whole restaurant. Who the hell would want a piece of Cheesecake after this horror, we won't be back to this location. I hope the disease of this place doesn't infect the whole chain. And this was NEVER our experience for 20 years of going here, I think it has been. So sad, but maybe things are just going to continue it seems so that is my experience. R.I.P. CF...!"
Mike C.,"PALOS VERDES PENINSULA, CA",0,93,,2.0,3/4/2016,"I'm giving them a 2 for their rule of 20 min. 20 min to take a drink order, 20 min to take your dinner order, 20 min to get dinner (that's ok), 20 min to clean away the dishes after the last person is done eating, 20 min to take your cheesecake order, and 20 min to get the birthday girls cheesecake because the need to write on the plate (they had to put it on top of her dinner plate which they never cleared, nice huh?).  The good news is you save on the bar order because they never check back on drink refills. We spent 3 hours here with REALLY slow service and just ok food. Location and cheesecake just doesn't make up for all the other issues this place has"
Jenny D.,"Lawndale, CA",53,51,269,4.0,7/31/2014,"Great American restaurants!  Large menu to choose from, they offer different variety of foods. You can get almost anything from tacos, pizza, pasta, steak or etc.... Great to go with large groups regard food choice but no reservation is accepted. The portions are large and you can share. Free breads at the beginning... They are always hot and yummy! Services is great, they are very attentive and always checking on you. Kids friendly place , offer a place a bread with smiley face for your little one :"") I love their cheesecakes....little pricy per slide but it is huge... Usually get them to go and enjoy at home."
Katherine D.,"Los Angeles, CA",16,84,36,5.0,6/18/2015,"I've hosted multiple corporate events here, and have always gotten compliments on the quality of food, and room set up. The staff here is highly attentive, efficient,  and dedicated to excellence. The AC is on full blast, and a few folks complained, but overall great experience."
Dawn Y.,"Torrance, CA",2,172,,4.0,12/8/2016,Hadn't been here in many years.  I love the fact that they have a regular size plates and then they have plates for the lighter side.  The food was delicious and we didn't even have dessert.
MARGIE I.,"Torrance, CA",911,699,1212,4.0,8/18/2014,"I had to pick a restaurant to have my anniversary dinner at, and my cousin suggested The Cheesecake Factory. Bang bang chicken and shrimp is our favorite dish there. Service is always great, and portions are generous. I had enough food left for 2 more meals! We also like the warm bread and butter too. The view is great if you go before sundown of course. Lots of different yummy cheesecake to choose from obviously.      -Enjoy life ;)"
Alecks R.,"Torrance, CA",248,246,6,3.0,2/25/2014,"What has the cheesecake factory become?  Back in my day, the cheesecake factory was a classy joint. A place for Valentine's Day, New Year's Eve dinners, and classy birthdays. Tonight it was a night where I saw sandals, football jerseys,and gym shorts.  Yes, the place was packed. The wait to get a table at one point was an hour and a half. However I am disappointed with the quality and the standard that the cheesecake factory has evolved into. Sadly, cheesecake factory is comparable to TGIF Fridays or Chili's now.  Although the food was delicious as always, I sadly give the cheesecake factory three stars; because that is what it has become, average. RIP to a legend."
Cuzzin Oh C.,"Lawndale, CA",3,23,11,1.0,8/11/2016,"This review has absolutely nothing to do with the food, service, hospitality, or cleanliness. This review has everything to do with the unfair, ridiculous, asinine parking accommodations for the public. This enormously famous dining franchise is literally forcing money out of your wallets before you even place a drink order. How embarrassing is it that there are only 20 FREE parking stalls for the hundreds and hundreds of public diners to the restaurant, yet over 200+ VALET parking stalls in the lot as well? To force your customers to Valet park just to dine at your restaurant is utterly ridiculous. We're already coming to spend money on the food, at a minimum you can provide free parking to the thousands of customers you see weekly. This is nothing more than a money grab and its embarrassing that a major restaurant such as this is so greedy that they can't even give back a little to the ones keeping these dim ass lights on in the first place."
Bill R.,"Cypress, CA",0,47,,4.0,7/17/2016,"You need to pay the valet guy $4.  There does not seem to be any parking around there. We went on a Sunday early evening. It was packed.  Besure to try their avocado eggroll. It does not seem to sound that great BUT IT IS.  It is is coupled with a sweet sauce. Utterly delicious. not cheap either at $12-13 for 6 pieces.  We had their meatloaf and potatoes and roasted corn vegetables.  The meatloaf was good, but the roasted corn vegetables were great. service was very good, We had a nice friendly attentive waitress."
