Steff M.,"Cerritos, CA",5,127,123,5.0,9/6/2015,"After an epic drink failure at The Slip on the pier. Myself and my companion embarked on a quest for redeeming quality drinks. The journey fought with twists and turns we ended up at Cheesecake factory. Joking aside, our drinks were awesome! I had the Georgia Peach a blended drink with an extra shot of vodka, my friend had a margarita. Bartender was nice, drinks were great thanks for saving us fron our fail of an experience at slips."
Chez F.,"El Segundo, CA",0,40,,4.0,1/17/2017,very good food and good service.  Always great to bring relatives from out of town. My husband loves it too!!
Laura S.,"Pasadena, CA",948,1507,6131,3.0,3/20/2012,"Pros: * Fast service * They will fix errors * Pretty restaurant - good for a big group * Pretty scenery (boats and marina) * They sing Happy Birthday to the Birthday person * Skinny Menu Cons: * Valet only. Metered parking outside the area. * Messed up my order- I ordered shrimp tacos, they gave me chicken * Accidentally charged us a extra drink and we had to discuss it with them * Tacos were not good Overall... eh."
Tyler T.,"Redondo Beach, CA",23,19,,5.0,11/29/2016,"Last night, I had the pleasure of visiting one of my favorite chain restaurants. The Cheesecake Factory has always been a favorite of mine. The one in Redondo Beach, I particularly enjoy, because it sits right next to the docked boats & after a meal it's nice to walk along the docks, look at the fish & boats, and make your way to the Portofino Inn & watch the seals. Last night, as I was saying, I decided to indulge my carbo cravings by choosing the Four Cheese Pasta, and I'm glad I did. The Penne pasta was cooked perfectly, the Mozzarella, Ricotta, Romano, and Parmesan cheese blended in perfectly with their light Marinara sauce & fresh basil. The menu offers an option for chicken, but I strayed a bit and asked if they would include an Italian sausage to the dish instead. It was wonderful. The bread was soft & piping hot so the butter melted on contact & our server was delightful! I ordered a cucumber lemonade, which I recommend, but I asked for them to water it down. Finally, to quench my sweet tooth, I went with Chris's Outrageous Cheesecake which definitely, did not disappoint. This deliciously designed masterpiece, is a multilayered, creamy chocolate chip coconut cheesecake with chocolate cake, chewy brownie, and a coconut pecan frosting, This place never disappoints! Thank You REDONDO BEACH CHEESECAKE FACTORY! YOU ARE A BIG DEAL!"
Kelli S.,"Honolulu, HI",1902,1170,9782,5.0,2/25/2014,"I've been to many different locations for The Cheesecake Factory, but I would say this is one of my favorites. The ocean/waterfront provides the perfect backdrop for dining (definitely recommend coming here if you are planning a romantic meal for that special someone). The first time I came to this location, it was for an anniversary dinner on a weeknight and it was pretty late - around 9 p.m. But that ended up being extremely beneficial, as there were hardly any customers and our server was most attentive. One of the reasons why The Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite restaurants is due to its extensive menu. There is truly something for everyone on there (picky eaters and those who love exotic cuisine). And did I mention the selection when it comes to cheesecakes/desserts? For first-timers, here's what I would recommend (based on my love for cheese and easy-to-please palate): Fried Macaroni and Cheese (appetizer): This gooey, cheesy mac and cheese mixture gets even better when deep fried and covered with a thin, crispy crumb layer. Cheese simply oozes out of the shell with every bite (truly a must for cheese lovers). The four mac and cheese balls are served with a creamy marinara sauce (not a very strong tomatoey taste) and bits of shredded cheese on top. Macaroni and Cheese Burger (glamburger): This burger definitely falls under the ""gourmet"" category. It's unique because it includes a slightly flattened deep-fried mac and cheese ball (like the ones featured in the appetizer mentioned above) atop a charbroiled patty, Cheddar cheese sauce, lettuce, tomato, pickles, an onion and mayo. I would recommend only eating half of this savory burger if you plan to save room for dessert. Grilled Cheese Sandwich (sandwich): This used to be a staple on the very bottom of the ""Glamburgers and Sandwiches"" portion of the menu, but the eatery has since taken it off ever since the menu was revised. I was told, however, that I could still order this delicious grilled cheese upon request. The dish features the customer's choice of cheese sandwiched between two pieces of egg-battered bread and is served with French Fries that are generously salted and tasty. Chicken Madeira (specialties): This chicken dish is famous as the eatery's ""most popular chicken dish."" Flavorful and savory, this one is definitely a winner. The dish contains a couple pieces of tender, sautéed chicken breast topped generously with melted Mozzarella cheese and pieces of asparagus. It's also covered with flavorful mushroom Madeira sauce and is served with fluffy mashed potatoes. Again, if you're a cheese lover, you'll want to indulge in this savory dish. Chicken Piccata (specialties): The flavor from the capers combined with the strands of Angel Hair pasta are probably the crowning glories of this dish. It features sautéed chicken breast topped with lemon sauce, mushrooms and capers. I would recommend asking for extra cheese for additional flavor/savoriness. Adam's Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple (cheesecake): Be forewarned - this is probably one of the sweetest cheesecakes on the menu, but it's definitely one of my favorites. This decadent dessert features the original cheesecake in an Oreo Cookie crust and includes caramel, chunks of Butterfingers and Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, and peanut butter throughout. Peanut butter lovers will especially appreciate the fresh dollop of peanut butter mousse that comes atop the cheesecake.  Reese's Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake Cheesecake (cheesecake): Even though this sounds overwhelmingly sweet, ironically, this cheesecake isn't as sweet as its close cousin, the Adam's Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple, because it contains layers of moist chocolate fudge cake in between the layers of cheesecake (versus layers of pure cheesecake). The layers of moist chocolate cake offset and complement the layers of cheesecake in a nice way, and peanut butter lovers will rejoice upon eating the dollop of peanut butter mousse atop the dessert. There are generous chunks of Reese's Peanut Butter Cups (my favorite candy) loaded in the cheesecake layers, and there are also thin layers of caramel. Finally, the crust is an absolute wonder, as it's covered with Reese's Peanut Butter Cups as well.  Oreo Dream Extreme Cheesecake (specialty cheesecake): Currently, the regular ""Oreo"" cheesecake has been replaced with the ""Oreo Dream Extreme Cheesecake"" on the dessert menu. I personally prefer the regular ""Oreo"" cheesecake because it does not contain the layer of Oreo Cookie mousse (whereas the ""Oreo Dream Extreme Cheesecake"" does). However, both cheesecakes have winning qualities, including generous chunks of Oreos baked into the layers of cheesecake, a sweet milk chocolate icing and a decadent Oreo Cookie crust."
Bella B.,"Cerritos, CA",214,230,1042,3.0,5/10/2012,"3.5 stars! Been coming here for about 15 years. Geez, that makes me feel old~ I've tried a lot of different items. Here is the rundown... Appetizers: - Tex Mex Eggrolls (Southwestern style eggrolls with avocado. Pretty good) - Spinach and Cheese dip (pretty standard, nothing spectacular) - Fire roasted fresh artichoke (I liked this, but then again, I love artichoke!) - Lettuce wraps (I really like the lettuce wraps here. Simple, clean, and yummy) - Sweet corn tamale cakes (These are also really good. I love sweet tamales) - Crabcakes (not bad, but not great. Order it from a seafood place, not here) Pastas: -Garlic Noodles (pretty good. I add chicken to it. Garlic sauce, tomatoes, mushrooms and asparagus. Simple and flavorful) - Evelyn's Fave Pasta (its just ok. it sounds better than it tastes. has eggplant, artichokes, olives, pine nuts, and tomatoes) - Farfalle with chicken and garlic (also has peas and pancetta in it. pretty tasty) - Shrimp with angel hair (one of my mom's faves... just like a scampi) Other entrees: - Steak Diane (a staple my family orders every time. Decent price and good flavor) - Shrimp scampi (pretty good. standard shrimp scampi. I ordered this a few times already) - Miso Salmon (personally I think miso sauce on fish could be with butterfish and nothing else. wasn't too impressed) Cheesecakes: - plain (you can't go wrong with plain, creamy, delicious cheesecake!) - reece's peanut butter chocolate (it was way too sweet for me) - kahlua coffee (one of my faves. its delish!) - chocolate rasberry truffle (a friend ordered it for me. big mistake because i don't like rasberry in my dessert. my friend seemed to enjoy it though) - Adams peanut butter cup (again, too sweet for me!) Cocktails: -Mojitos (I just stick to the mojitos. pineapple is the best!)"

Adriana P.,"Ozone Park, Queens, NY",48,128,210,5.0,3/5/2015,"We came in here on a whim because we were craving drinks and dessert...  After a few minutes at the bar, while chatting with the SUPER SWEET bartenders; my husband ran to use the bathroom Ok-big deal, who cares about his bathroom trip you say?  You will.  As he rounded the corner, he ran into UFC legend Anderson the Spider Silva!!!!!!!! He ran back to get me (as I am an avid MMA practitioner and instructor) and I almost died when I rounded that corner.  There he was in all his legendary glory, having an early dinner with his kids and other family members.  Apparently he is a regular there.  He was soooooo sweet and agreed to take pics and stayed to talk with us.  I of course was a nervous wreck and could barely speak properly.  After schmoozing with the Spider, we went back and took our seats at the bar; only to realize that we were sitting next to Machine Gun Kelly (radio personality)! He too was such a nice guy.  Jeez, Los Angeles was a dream..  One of the best trips ever.   If you're ever in the Redondo Beach area, stop by this specific Cheesecake Factory... It's sitting pretty right on the water and I'm sure you'll run into someone ""famous"".  Happy eating!"
Evan F.,"Redondo Beach, CA",18,362,113,5.0,3/6/2014,I have always enjoyed the food and service here. Best to go during non peak times as the wait for a table can be long. The service has Lawry's been good and the food selections excellent. Ironically I've never tried their cheesecake. Maybe next time. Parking is another issue. I don't like valet parking so I always park on the street at a meter. But I've never had a polemic finding a parking space.
Tae G.,"Los Angeles, CA",101,765,1929,4.0,7/10/2015,I enjoy eating here during the summer. You get a nice view of the bay if you sit on the patio. I kind of stick to my usual items when I order so one of my favorites is the firecracker salmon spring rolls. The dipping sauce is just right. This place can get crowded so expect a bit of a wait on average. Only valet parking is available as well. I don't eat desserts very often but I do like the red velvet cheesecake when it's available.
Janine T.,"Garden Grove, CA",34,14,3,2.0,5/31/2016,"I'm rating it a 2 star for the food & service. My husband & I ordered rib eye ""medium"" cook. Mine came out like ""well done"". Not only that it was soo dry & bitter.  I guess I shouldn't go to eat steak at Cheesecake Factory. I told the waiter the steak was dry n bitter. He just said ""oh?"" & left. Thought he'd come back to apologize or something. But no. That was it. Don't know why they bother to ask how's your food. Anyway don't order steak here. I've heard others said the service at Cheesecake Factory is not too good.  I saw the proof."
Rachel C.,"San Diego, CA",466,103,45,4.0,2/17/2015,"The cheesecake factory is good for a solid meal you can count on.  I'm sure most everyone has been here before, but for those who haven't they have a huge menu of pasta, mexican food, seafood, salads, anything you can imagine, but they actually do most things pretty darn well. In recent years they've added a small plates menu and a healthy options menu, which is great because they are generally known for giant shareable portions, which unfortunately come with a big calorie load for those of us lacking self control ;)   I love the ahi tuna tartar and the pear gorgonzola flatbread, so good, and good size portions for like $6, both under 500 calories, love it. The cheesecake is also phenomnal and comes in about 40 different varities if you're feeling indulgent.  My personal favorite is the carmel turtle, so freaking good. Also a couple often overlooked non-cheescake deserts there worthy of trying out are the lemoncello torte and the warm apple crips a la mode, both excellent. This particular location is great because it's right on the water in Redondo Beach so perfect at sunset time."
Daniel J.,"Torrance, CA",922,93,88,1.0,1/27/2015,Went there with 5 others so there was 6 total ... We ordered some drinks and lunch.   It all was good... UNTIL... The birthday girls pizza did not come out with the food ??? the waiter said they did not make it and it would be a few minutes.. ( well we have all been there and it comes to late) so we canceled it .. and said we would share food .. Not that big of a deal RIGHT .. Then the Manager comes to the table says the kitchen made the wrong pizza and they were.. VERY SORRY.. Ok still BS but they were trying right ... Then we order cheese cake for all still nothing ..   My bill was 167.. bucks.. and they would not even give the birthday girl a free piece of Cheese Cake         Or recognize our event ... What the heck ..     How CHEEP and I felt they could of done something for us besides  FLAP THERE LIPS      I an in the same game as them .. We make mistakes. .at our place. The sorry about our mistake is backed up with something tang-able   ..
Peter I.,"Carlsbad, CA",491,649,807,4.0,2/17/2014,"I wasn't sure I would like this place. Huge menu, it was kinda overwhelming at first. But, we dove in and tried a bunch of stuff. Fried mac and cheese-good Burger-good nachos-good sashimi-good chicken in a pink sauce with pasta-A OK. Salmon-suprisingly good But, what really sold me was the next day I heated up the other half of my daughters burger and it might have been better than 90% of the burgers ever....!!! That's a burger. Last piece of advice.... Start backwards and have cheesecake first! I'll be back again."
Lisa J.,"Compton, CA",42,67,195,5.0,4/6/2015,"I never been disappointed! Everything you order is delicious!!! My boyfriend too me on Sunday morning for my bday brunch! Since he know I LOVE  their orange chicken! There fried avocado is to die for !!! Come with fried mushroom, fried avocado and fried zucchini ! It's a must try at least once ! I love their double chocolate cheesecake! Carrot one is good too. I promise you'll enjoy anything you get!! You can never go wrong with the Cheesecake Factory! Costumer service is always great too ! You can get a really nice view if you eat in the patio. If you want to do a romantic dinner . It's also a great place. It's so pretty at night in the patio. And they have heaters!"
Andrey I.,"Anaheim, CA",335,63,152,5.0,1/7/2015,"Oh boy, the Margarita did its job, giving them 5 star, cheesecake was very good, nuts, caramel, no doubt. All of sudden evening is getting better."
Olivia W.,"Bellflower, CA",20,3,,5.0,9/15/2015,I love the cheesecake factory. Great food and service.  I highly recommend the Cajun chicken little. That's the best dish.
Matt M.,"Palos Verdes Peninsula, CA",3,2,,2.0,1/17/2016,"Besides the fact that there was a metal twist tie in my friends salad, the food was delicious. Be sure to bring your piggy bank because the food isn't cheap. The variety of cheesecakes stare you down as you enter the restaurant and do not let you not pick one up after your meal. It's truly brilliant to put the cheesecakes on display at the entrance of the restaurant. Meanwhile your bill is through the roof."
Shadya G.,"Long Beach, CA",24,167,42,5.0,2/3/2016,"Natalie is the best! I have been to this location several times and the service has never left me this happy. She is extremely warm and knowledgeable about the menu. She has great suggestions, a beautiful smile and personality. She literally is the perfect example of what a waitress should be. I will be back for sure and it's all because of Natalie, thank you!!!"
Marley-Jaii W.,"Earth, TX",31,50,57,4.0,1/3/2014,"+ 1st redondo beach, ca cheese cake factory ""review"" of 20.14 2nd time @ a cheese cake factory! Our waiter ""Brando C."" was very nice and respectful (he gets 5 out of 5 stars) the cheese cake factory gets 4/5 because I didn't like: 1) hot chocolate  2) the rice  3) $4.00 for parking (I didn't like that b/c we already paying 4 the food now I have to pay 4 parking. It's like a trick the factory has b/c ""I"" didn't c no free parking but there are coin meters.  4) the oreo cheesecake  I did like: 1) Teriyaki Chicken  2) Baked Banana  3) Caramel Pecan Cheese Cake 4) The outside view (looking onto the water & the boats) 5) the Pager  The outside eating area has heating lamps (that came be hot to seat by) the star pager b/c it was crowded & we went outside and they paged us so we will not miss our turn. We didn't have to wait long to be seated. I had the cheese cake factory ""slice of joy"" cards (2) which means my friend & I cheese cake were free! ™ 1.1.14"
