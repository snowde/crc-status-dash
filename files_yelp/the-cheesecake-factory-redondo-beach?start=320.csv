Susan M.,"Corona, CA",127,294,96,4.0,6/9/2015,"A beautiful view of the harbor, convenient valet parking and yummy food make this a winning restaurant. I love their Chicken Piccata....the best I have found anywhere. The sauce is the perfect blend of lemon and butter, and the chicken is incredibly tender. It is served over angel hair pasta. I ask for it without mushrooms and they happily accommodate.  For dessert, cheesecake is a must. This most recent time I ordered the Oreo which was sinfully good. I also like the white chocolate raspberry.  So given that I liked everything, you may be asking why the 4 stars? The reason has to do with being a parent. My daughter is 2 years old and this restaurant had no coloring or crayons. It is quite unusual for a restaurant to not offer anything to keep the little ones busy. Thankfully, I had some crayons and a coloring book in my car. The only change I would suggest is for the restaurant to consider how to keep the little ones busy."
Wolfram L.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,35,17,1.0,1/5/2015,"If they are busy, the service is just bad. We had ants running on our table. It took more than 20 minutes to get another table. So we had to eat and fight simultaneously."
Reese M.,"Los Angeles, CA",328,333,210,4.0,9/12/2012,"I am a HUGE fan of the Grilled Shrimp and Bacon Club. Please give it a try. This is one of my favorite locations due to the scenery. If weather permits, sit on the heated patio. If in the mood for dessert, you can't go wrong with the Strawberry covered cheesecake, Pineapple upside-down cheesecake, or the Banana cream cheesecake."
X. S.,"Long Beach, CA",24,136,209,4.0,2/9/2015,"PROS :  location (although there's a lot of construction going on) friendly service large portions reasonable prices full bar CONS :  valet small self-parking lot gets really busy FAVORITES :  green tea (with mint!) pretzel crusted chicken fried mac & cheese  Miso Salmon Chris' Outrageous cheesecake (great if you love german chocolate cake) OVERALL :  We've been going to this particular location for years and we've always had a good experience. Our most recent visit went very well. Our server was attentive, quick and friendly. She definitely was on top of everything - refils, suggestions etc.  Food is great. Large portions! Share or take half of everything you order home. One note, if you can't avoid using the valet service, be sure to inspect your vehicle. We witnessed more than a few close calls while the attendants were driving the customer's cars around the lot. They seem to be in a rush to park the cars and aren't too careful. Just a warning! All in all, we had a good time and will be back."
Gerardo M.,"Wilmington, CA",42,131,48,4.0,5/29/2015,Good restaurant! Valet parking only... Food was great.. I ordered the Chicken Piccata and it was delicious! Avocado egg rolls are a must try! Nice view if you sit by the window.
J. K.,"Redondo Beach, CA",25,19,,2.0,12/29/2015,"Poor service. Had to ask for forks. Brought all of one persons food while everyone else waited for 15 minutes. What happened to the onion strings. One used to get enough for you meal and now it's less than a handful. Moreover they started by bringing us onion rings. Took over 30 minutes to get two salads, salmon and a burger at 2:00. Only came because of a gift card and will not return."
Toni M.,"Compton, CA",100,29,11,5.0,6/26/2015,"We were there 6/25 for my daughters birthday and I have to say our waitress Sydney was EXCELLENT, she had the best attitude and personality I've experienced in a long time. The food was great, everyone enjoyed it."
Anaom T.,"Torrance, CA",8,32,10,5.0,6/25/2015,"This is my favorite restaurant in the world!! Quote me because its no lie. I can't deny u cheesecake factory. U have the best calamari ive ever had in my life. The nicely fried and well seasoned squid can be eaten alone or dipped into the delicious cocktail sauce that I can probably drink by the shot if nobody was watching.   My favorite meal has got to be Chicken Madeira..idk what's in the sauce,  but it got me hooked.  Strawberry lemonade is also yummy but you have to be in the mood for it. It can be too sweet sometimes,  but nothing a little extra water can't fix.   I've never went without having a cheesecake so you know im an expert. My fave so far has got to be the banana cheesecake and the chocolate mouse cheesecake. All cheesecakes taste fresh n always arrive to the table in such gorgeous presentation that sometimes it takes me minutes to take in the beauty before I devour it like a shark to a surfer.  I love you CF. See you soon."
Beetna L.,"Torrance, CA",175,15,68,2.0,11/14/2015,"Let me start off by saying the food was good and service was wonderful from everyone BUT our server. She seemed annoyed with us the whole time. We literally just left and I thought I could brush it off but her attitude was just so unnecessary.  I came here with my mom and her two friends for a quick celebration lunch for me graduating and passing my licensing test to become a nail tech. My moms english is not bad at all but her two friends cant speak/understand as well so i ordered for them. It didn't seem to slow her down, i felt like actually it was helping her since their english would be difficult to understand. But the whole time she acted annoyed with our table. I let it go but it was when we were leaving.  We asked for boxes since we had a lot of food leftover and she asked for our plates. When she grabbed them she asked one of my moms friend to ""leave the fork"" and her friend thought she meant on the table so she did. And the server said ""no leave the fork i need it to put the food in the boxes"" but like i said her english isn't the best so i was like oh okay and proceeded to grab the fork for her but instead she looked at us rolled her eyes and walked away saying ""no its fine ill just grab another one"" i was like wtf?? But when she came back she gave us ONE BAG so my moms friend said ""oh separate please"" and the server replied with ""YEAH i know I'm going to bring some after"" in the rudest tone! At that point i ordered in some cheesecakes togo i said ""could i have two lemon raspberry in two separate boxes and bags"" and she stares at me and goes ""annnnd?"" I repeated my order again and she stares again and goes ""okay anddd?"" And so i said ""yeah thats it just those two in different boxes"" and she goes ""yeah OK just making sure THATS it"" and she walked away.. Like wth it wasn't the worst but her attitude was not okay and she seemed annoyed for no reason. You don't need to be all perky and giggly but the least you could be is POLITE."
Dana P.,"El Segundo, Los Angeles, CA",372,88,50,3.0,4/20/2015,"Last several times I've been here it's been a bit of chaos. Drink orders wrong, food orders wrong or cold, no greeting for several minutes after being seated. I know it's busy there but gotta get the madness under control!"
Fatima R.,"Washington, DC",36,3,1,5.0,5/3/2016,"Of course I'm a regular at The Cheesecake Factory and never can I leave with a cheesecake to go:-) I just love love, love the chicken/shrimp jambalaya pasta. You can never go wrong with lots of flavors and shrimp. Definitely a good recommendation if you like spicy flavorful pasta xxxxx"
Bernaddette G.,"Long Beach, CA",21,7,,5.0,2/3/2016,We came for my daughter's birthday. Let me just tell you the service is outstanding and it's all because of Natalie! She was extremely patient. The hostess was irritated with us when we requested to be reseated... So we were off to a bad start. When Natalie approached us with her warm smile and kind personality she immediately changed our attitudes. We ordered what she suggested and it was outstanding. We never had to ask for a refill or anything she was on top of everything. She is extremely warm and makes you feel very welcome. Every time we come we will request her to be our server. Thank you so much for perfect service and one of the best meals we've had!!!!!!
JoAnn G.,"Rolling Hills Estates, CA",1,4,,1.0,5/14/2016,"Noisy, terrible service, food is only fair, if we ever get it served correctly. Drafty table near the outside service entrance. Won't be back."
Marie AK C.,"Orange County, CA",1160,344,1863,4.0,3/1/2014,"Grear location, on the pier. The Cheesecake Factory franchise always has a place in my heart and tummy! Their menu is extensive. Everything and anything from healthy salads, burgers, pastas, pizza, asian, Mexican, you name it.. And of course, their cheesecakes are amazing. My fave cheesecake is plain with strawberries! Def go on an empty stomach and try not to get full off their complimentary breads and butter (trust me, it's hard not to!). Always good service. Portions are large and prices are decent. At this particular location, you'll have to valet your car if you're not lucky enough to find metered parking."
Michele G.,"Beverly Hills, CA",44,240,229,4.0,6/20/2014,"Celebrated my friends 50th bday. Made reservations 1 week in advance for a party of 10. We were seated on time. Our server was fantastic. . I was able to decorate the table with Beautiful pink balloons and green beads.. The food was good, although we all noticed the temperature of the food could had been warmer.  Restaurant was clean. We were lucky to find self parking to avoid the $4.00 valet. Self parking is to the right of the restaurant. . Reservations suggested."
Angela G.,"Albuquerque, NM",8,1,,4.0,8/4/2016,"Food is always awesome at The Cheesecake Factory. Just DO NOT sit outside at this location, unless of course you enjoy the smell of old garbage dumpsters."
John A.,"Redondo Beach, CA",0,3,,1.0,7/31/2016,Been here in Redondo For 40 years. I remember when Cheese Cake came here and it was great food. A Corporation purchased it and we shaw the food quality go down over 30 years. Sad because we used to come here a few times a week. Now we ask ourselves why should we go. The menu has changed to a lower quality catering to a more fast food tastebud. More fatty.
Wesley C.,"Monterey Park, CA",219,197,41,4.0,12/8/2014,"I just realized for the many times I've been here, i haven't written a review yet! First thing you'll notice: huuuge parking lot BUT valet only! why?!? $4 valet too.... FOOD: This time around I ordered the jambalaya pasta while my gf ordered the pasta with chicken and scampi sauce. The jambalaya had great flavor: spicy with a bit of sweetness from the onions and bell peppers. However the noodles and shrimp were way over-cooked. Noodles were mushy and past the point of al dente. Shrimp when cooked right has a snap when you bite into it. These had a slightly mushy exterior. Also, the whole dish felt overly oily, but I think that is with all pasta at Cheesecake. 2/5 The chicken with scampi sauce is better: the noodles are cooked al dente and the dish didn't feel as heavy as the jambalaya. 4/5 Overall: 3/5 SERVICE: Our food came in a timely manner and everything went smoothly. Our waitress was nice and checked up on us every so often. Overall: 4/5 DECOR/AMBIANCE: The restaurant overlooks the bay and is very beautiful during the day, but you won't see much at night. Dimly lit restaurant that has a casual feel even though I know Cheesecake tries to make it very upscale.  Overall: 4/5 Their pasta can be hit or miss. As with my Jambalaya tonight, it was a miss, but my gf's dish was good. I really don't get why they require valet service for a place that has such a large parking lot. Their cheesecakes are great, but only if you have room for it afterwards. Their portions are pretty large.  PRO-TIP: if you get the pasta, get the sauce on the side so that you can mix in your own amounts to prevent the overly oily and heavy feeling of the sauce."
Bear B.,"Redondo Beach, CA",2,23,8,5.0,3/2/2015,Ramon & Jeff are always on point  The service never disappoints but more importantly the food is awesome Happy hour on weekdays- be sure to order the spinach dip and spring rolls  Amazinggg Thank you Ramon for an awesome experience tonight
Jason H.,"Los Angeles, CA",245,211,11,3.0,3/21/2015,Had a bad first experience the manager reached out to me so we shall give it a second go
