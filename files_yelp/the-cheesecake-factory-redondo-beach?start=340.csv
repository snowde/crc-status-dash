Margy S.,"Torrance, CA",0,6,,2.0,12/17/2016,"I am extremely disappointed with the service I received tonight at my Redondo Beach, CA restaurant. I placed an order on 12/15 for a Lemon Raspberry 10 inch Cheesecake for pick up the next night. I asked if it would be like the slice I had ordered last month from the Grove location with the Raspberry Sauce and whipped cream and was told yes that is how I would receive it. Fast forward to picking it up. I waited over 20 minutes as it sat on the counter in the box for someone to place it in a bag and let me know it was ready. I had her open it up to make sure it was the right on. I asked about the Raspberry Sauce and was told it would be an additional $1.50, Fine but where were the rosettes of whipped cream? I was told we can't do that. Come on, this is for a Holiday dinner party and it does not even look like what I had previously ordered. I than asked if I had bought a whole one out of the display case would that have come with everything? Yes. She than shoves a container of whipped cream in the bag and that will be the last I time I go to that location. I could have ordered the same on with free 2 day shipping from Harry and Davids and it would have come with the presentation to be served at a dinner party out of the box. Poor customer service."
Yvette Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,6,,5.0,10/31/2016,"Visited here on Saturday 10/29/2016 about 7pm.  Sat in the bar area and ended up with a very very nice waitress named KIANA.  She was attentive, efficient and very pleasant the whole time we were there (approx. and hour and 1/2). I stopped counting how many times she passed by to make sure we were OK with everything.  Didn't have to ask for anything.  If I could rate her a 10 I would.  I come here frequently and have had pretty good service but this young lady  was exceptional. Will be back and soon and hopefully we can sit in her area.  YAY KIANA!!!!"
Jim R.,"Nashville, TN",23,70,3,1.0,10/21/2014,Well Thought we would grab a nice desert after dinner Would you like fork and napkin.  Yes please Oh I don't care I will not give you any Thanks for the pain in the ass
BF S.,"Los Angeles, CA",9,119,43,3.0,1/3/2015,Sad to say I was disappointed. I have been coming here for many years and have often said this was the best local cheesecake. Today my meal was just ordinary. I had the buffalo burger and it was next to flavorless. Not that we needed to eat more but the portions were much smaller than before. Don't think I'll be in a hurry to go back.
H L.,"San Pedro, CA",0,43,27,3.0,5/17/2015,"We came here on a weekend and the place was packed and the only available parking was valet. But I was craving Cheesecake...It was really loud inside and it seems like tables were crammed together to accommodate bigger crowds. Every food I had in any of this establishment was always meh but cheesecakes are always good -- Red Velvet Cheesecake is the best! However, since we are going for a stroll at the beach too, bf suggested I eat real food (I only wanted to order Cheesecake) so I tried the Egg Rolls--it was delicious! I devoured the whole plate and since the portion is just right, I had enough space for dessert. :)"
Kevin E.,"Los Angeles, CA",19,18,4,2.0,1/3/2015,"Very disappointed! This place used to be so much better. My Kobe burger was good, but the rest of the food was not great. My daughters pasta was a mess, and my wife's sandwich was entirely ordinary. Service was pretty shoddy too. We asked for a window seat and even waited for a booth to be made available.  When we were eventually told that our table was ready it wasn't a window seat as had been promised. Our server was also less than acceptable, and food came out in bits and pieces, with some of us waiting for food while others were already well into eating their meal. They need to jack up their service!"
Meg B.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,23,,1.0,12/23/2015,"My boyfriend and I stopped in to get cake to take home for dessert, and didn't check the bag. My $8 piece of carrot cake looked like someone's leftovers, a sliver from the back half of the cake and then a large pile of crumbs that they tried to hide under a mountain of whipped cream. Check your takeout, folks!"
Alvin R.,"Carson, CA",114,46,17,2.0,8/24/2015,"I've been to this location in the past, and although The Cheesecake Factory isn't my favorite restaurant, I do enjoy some of their menu items. The food during our visit yesterday was no different, so my review is based on customer service. I took my parents to this location yesterday for lunch and received lack of customer service. I can't say it was bad or terrible, but a lack of service because we felt our server was hardly around or took a long time. It took a while until we first saw our server, so I figured we order everything all at once - drinks, appetizers, and main dishes. While waiting, I noticed it was taking a while before we got our waters. In fact, my dad's cocktail was brought sooner by another server than our waters from our actual server. Anyone notice something odd about that, but me? I don't know how long it takes to make cocktails, but I'm pretty sure it would take much longer to make cocktail drinks than pour a glass of water. Also, it's probably a lesser complaint than what I'm about to share, but when our bread was brought out, I noticed our server had another table's check booklet on top of our bread. You don't know who's hands or dirty tables these booklet carrying checks have touched. So, to see that on top of our bread was a little rude, I thought. After our meal, I asked for the check and boxes for our leftovers. Again, it took a while for our server to deliver these items. She first comes by for our boxes, but doesn't have our check. When finally she hands me our check on her second trip to our table, she was nowhere to be found for me to pay for our meals. At this point, I pretty much had it because I was in a hurry. So, I went to the front counter expecting to pay there. To my disbelief, I was told by 3 ladies near the front counter working the dessert bar that I would have to go back to our table to pay. WTF? Not until I asked a gentleman behind the counter if he was the manager did I find out that it was absolutely fine to pay at the front counter. At that point, I pretty much lost it. I'm not one to be vocal and start a scene with my complaints, but the fact 3 ladies at the front counter, including one who takes down the number of guests at the front, did not have a clue what to do totally blew my mind. Either they did not have any idea how to resolve a problem or they did not want to deal with it. I'm really upset how the situation was handled. I had to wait until I asked the gentleman behind the register, if he was the manager in order for me to pay at the front counter. I've never worked as a server, but if you can't ring a customer at the front counter because it's the duty of the table server, I'm sure there's a manager who can override and get it done. Why did no one do that in the first place? Because I was able to get it done... and I don't even work there. The food is delicious, but the customer service here during our visit yesterday was nonexistent. The ladies who work here rubbed me off the wrong way and gave me the impression they had no clue how to resolve an issue. A COMPLETE DISREGARD for customer satisfaction. I honestly received fast and satisfactory treatment from their valet. The servers at this location can learn something from their valet because these guys sure know how to hustle."
Michael D.,"Los Angeles, CA",622,124,3634,5.0,9/9/2014,"What more can you say about CF? Great food, great location. CF is a classic restaurant. Could you imagine a world without CF? All of our hearts would break! Love the Cajun jambalaya, and the carrot cheesecake is to die for. Face it, all of the cheesecakes are to die for! I'll always come back!"
Christina Jane S.,"Hawthorne, CA",126,110,98,3.0,9/23/2015,"I came in to purchase an original cheesecake order to go. All I have to say is it's extremely expensive and such a tiny little cake! I suggest going to Costco for half the price and double the size. I only came here because I had a gift card so it was basically free. Yay for free cheesecake, but boo for how much of my gift card was gone. I should have used it on food!"
Jay W.,"Riverside, CA",158,82,50,2.0,8/30/2015,"This is hands down the worst experience I've ever had at a Cheesecake factory by an extreme margin. Our party of 6 are all fans of the chain, and we were simply shocked at how poor the service was with our waitress (mid-late 30s blond with really short hair). We were there on the 28th, seated on the patio at around 9:30 pm. This is the nicest Cheesecake Factory I've seen to date, which made the service even more disappointing. To preface my issues ... I realize restaurants are strangers serving other strangers. We don't know each other, and I don't think the world revolves around me or my loved ones BUT as customers, we want to 1) eat good food, and at a sit down establishment such as Cheesecake ... 2) be made feel our business is valued and presence desired. If someone is having a special day (especially) and we've chosen the establishment you work at to celebrate, it's extremely insulting to be treated with total apathy regarding customer service in general, much less that something special is happening. After all, it's why you .... the waiter or waitress .... are able to collect a tip which should be commensurate with your level of service (the waitress is fortunate I have enough integrity and too big a conscience to NOT leave a 0% tip ... but in hindsight, I truly wish I would have). The night we attended was my Daughter's 23rd birthday and an ideal rendezvous point for ""the rest of the family"" to meet with her and her fiance (who had just proposed in a helicopter just prior to meeting us). After having waited an hour and fifteen minutes to be seated, it was another 15 minutes after being shown to the table before we were greeted by our waitress. After being informed by a member of our party as to ""the birthday girl"" being present as well as the proposal just having happened, the waitresses response was an indifferent ""Oh"" followed by a monotone request to another guest asking them what they wanted. We had to ask 3 times for straws. My daughter's steak was served with no knife, and we sat for another 10-15 waiting to see her before finally flagging a different waiter down (we were also brought our straws by a different male waiter). Additionally, I placed my order and our waitress was gone for 15 minutes before returning to tell me they no longer carry that item on the menu and she'd forgotten to tell me previously. When leaving, she dumped a dirty fork in my GFs lap (who was wearing a white dress) and responded (still consistently apathetic) by saying ""Yeah, I saw it going over the side there"", but didn't apologize at all. In fact, not once was there an apology for anything being slow, forgotten, etc.  What makes this all more insulting is observing this waitress's service to the female couple at the table just next to ours. One of the female customers informed the waitress she'd just proposed to her (now) fiance sitting next to her, and they were engaged. It was the first (and only) semblance I saw of happiness, kindness, and customer service come from this waitress and one would think they'd all been life long besties based on the warm socializing and prompt customer service that consistently transpired.  The ONLY saving grace to this place getting 2 stars vs 1, is the 2 male waiters that assisted with our table. They seemed genuinely concerned as to whether we had what we needed, and displayed more sense of urgency in meeting our needs than what was actually necessary, but given our waitress's behavior, it was simply nice to see and much appreciated. Food was (at least) consistent with what can be expected at Cheesecake Factory. If it's a regular night out, you're not in any kind of hurry, and customer service is irrelevant as long as food is good, then ""sure""go here. If there's any kind of special event going on and you don't wanted it tainted by someone with an absolute shite attitude serving you, it's worth giving consideration to another location. Despite seeing positive reviews as well regarding this particular CF, it's interesting to note the parallels in description of bad service for those who also rated it poorly. Guess we were one of the unlucky ones, and my advice is to not take the dice roll if it's an important occasion."
Helen D.,"Santa Barbara, CA",459,1111,27612,5.0,1/7/2014,"Five stars for the blueberry mojitos. They use frozen blueberries, not fresh, but was soooo fucking good!!!! I had two and been dreaming about it since. Mmmm. Dinner was good. They didn't have my chicken over watercress so I changed it to some kind of beef dish, rare, and it was good. The fried Mac n cheese balls for appetizer was excellent."
Nicole D.,"Torrance, CA",339,211,345,2.0,6/16/2016,"You can't beat the location or the view, the mandatory valet is kind of annoying but it is the beach so I can deal with it. I remember when i was younger (junior high / high school  age) I loved the food and their encyclopedia sized menu. However since I've become an adult I have realized that the food quality is not there for the price, the service is just kind of meh and that encyclopedia i mentioned earlier is actually a bit alarming; they can really keep ALL of the ingredients on deck with out anything going bad? Just a little OCD, I'm sure it's fine, right? I guess It depends on the time of day and the server but in the last handful of visits I can't remember ever leaving and saying that was a fabulous meal or that was great service. If you're just looking for cheese cake and a view this place would definitely be more like 4 stars. Either way, it has it's strengths and it weaknesses just don't go with super high expectations."
Catrina G.,"Lomita, CA",34,15,10,4.0,7/19/2015,Another great meal at Cheesecake Factory.  Relaxing and great service.  Valet parking is now $4 and there are no street side spots any longer.  Had the Crispy Chicken Costoletta.  Leftovers were wonderful.
Mike M.,"Huntington Beach, CA",1821,1380,381,4.0,8/17/2014,"Pre-birthday dinner for me with my family and folks.  Excellent service, excellent selection of drinks, apps, entrees and, of course, desserts.  We had a great time on the patio enjoying the cool breeze and sunset.  For a chain, this place is great."
Jilma B.,"Santa Fe Springs, CA",96,110,128,5.0,12/19/2015,"First time visiting The Cheesecake Factory of Redondo Beach.  It is in a great location overseeing the Marina Lagoon.  The ambience and restaurant was pleasant.  Loved the first waiter, the second one was ok.  But overall great customer service.  My friend and I ordered the same plate, Chicken and Shrimp Jambalaya.  She gave me a good tip that works well for those who do not like their meals too spicy because it is spicy, just ask for a side of Alfredo Sauce and pour it all in the pasta and it will boost up to a even better taste!! Loved it!  Will definitely come back during lunch hour."
Katherine N.,"Burbank, CA",0,80,13,1.0,10/7/2014,"Parking was HORRIBLE - after finally figuring out the entrance and getting in line for the valet, he drove up next to my car & signaled for me to roll down the window - after I did so, he asked me if I was leaving or arriving.  Arriving.  He proceeded to tell me that I should go and find a parking spot!  (That was after honking at me to get out of his way) Staff were awful, our waiter was nice, but the service was SLOW and we had a hard time getting drinks/dessert/boxes.   While we were sitting their with our kids (toddlers) we heard three different workers swearing as they were talking to one another.   WOW. The bathrooms?  Wow.  One toilet had no toilet paper, the next had a roll sitting on the ground in a puddle (of what?) and the last had excrement all over the side and down the front of the bowl.  Even the sinks & floor were disgusting.   Worst Cheesecake Factory I have ever visited.  wow."
Rafael H.,"Carson, CA",1,47,57,4.0,12/11/2015,"We stopped in for a late lunch one afternoon and had a wonderful experience at the Cheesecake Factory in Redondo Beach, Thank You Axl for serving my family and I, we enjoyed ourselves and our food its happy faces and wonderful service that bring customers back our lunch was perfect and so was the lemon meringue cheesecake thanks again for suggesting we have dessert. Five star service -1 star for the parking situation, there was no self parking we had to pay for valet parking"
Jaclyn J.,"Mission Viejo, CA",183,5,,4.0,3/29/2016,My best friend and I came here because I had a gift card. The atmosphere was extremely fancy and the customer service was excellent. The only downside is parking. It's $4 for valet or you can self park but the tiniest parking lot is the only one available. Forcing people to pay for valet seems a bit ridiculous but over all it was a good time.
Evelyn E.,"Norwalk, CA",166,33,4,3.0,2/22/2015,We ordered the Fried Mac and Cheese. So delicious. I also ordered the Catfish. That wasn't as great. It didn't taste seasoned at all. The sauce was okay but adding a little salt to the fish before frying it would have done wonders.  We had to valet our car since there was no parking and unfortunately we didn't have any cash. There is NO ATM so we had to walk to the hotel up the street to get cash to pay the valet. That sucked! Had a cramp from the walk.
