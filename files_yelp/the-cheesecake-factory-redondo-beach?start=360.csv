Farah R.,"Lawndale, CA",15,71,9,4.0,8/30/2014,"I have been coming here for years. I frequent this Cheesecake Factory and the one in Marina Del Rey. If you want a beautiful view of the marina, you should visit the latter. This one does have a gorgeous view of the boat slips and yachts during the day, but there is no light at night so you can't see anything except the hotel/restaurant across the water. However, the romantic ambiance makes up for the lack of view at night. Every time I have come here, I have enjoyed  the food. Maybe nice or twice the service was a miss, but I won't complain too much because again, the good is amazing. My favorite appetizers are the Firecracker Shrimp and the Buffalo Blasts (cheesy chicken, cheese and buffalo sauce all wrapped in a pastry crust and deep fried to resemble a crunchy, meat-pie-shaped egg roll - pure heaven).  Main course favorites are Madeira Chicken and Shrimp, Orange Flavored Beef and their BBQ Beef Shortribs (melt in your mouth). And you can't go wrong with any dessert. They are all delicious. The Ghiradelli Brownie Sundae that we had last week was divine. At least 3 tables next to us asked us what it was because of the presentation.  For a sweet craving or dinner solution, Cheesecake Factory is your place."
Audrey L.,"Beverly Hills, CA",72,50,16,4.0,8/7/2016,"A group of five of us went to celebrate our friend, Tom's birthday.  Tom was staying at the Redondo crown Plaza Hotel so this was in walking distance.  My only complaint, as is with the other cheesecake Factories, is you cannot make reservations.  We ended up eating at a table in the bar area as our wait at 8:30 was 40 minutes.  That was fine but a little noisy.  The food is delicious!  Love their bread!  We had a side of guacamole for the table.  I had the ""skinnylicious"" medallions of beef medium rare and yea!  They were actually medium rare and very good.  My beef came with mashed potatoes and grilled veggies.  I took half home.  My friend Ellen had the ""skillylicious' grilled salmon with grilled veggies and she tool half home also.  Tom had tacos from the ""small cravings"" and Patricia had egg rolls from the ""small cravings.""  All was cooked to perfection and generous portions even in the ""small cravings.""  Since it was Tom's birthday, he got a banana cream cheesecake and the wait staff sang ""happy birthday"" to him. We all got a taste of his, and it was yummy.  They wrote Happy Birthday Tom in chocolate sauce on the plate.  I was surprised his dessert was not comped as some restaurants do.   I live near the B H Cheesecake Factory and love it."
Rachel A.,"Carson, CA",168,200,353,5.0,10/28/2013,One of my favorite restaurants of all time! Food is amazing and serves large portions on the entrees. I recommend: Calamari  Pasta Da Vinci (omg soooo good!)  Crispy chicken costoletta Red velvet cheesecake (huge slice)  Can't wait to come back again and try other dishes
Fawn D.,"Los Angeles, CA",233,232,72,4.0,1/18/2016,Love the view here! Other Cheesecake Factory aren't located near the waterfront. I would recommend coming here if you forgot to order a birthday cake beforehand. Lots of choices and it's ready asap.
Chris H.,"Adelaide, Australia",0,20,4,3.0,11/8/2015,Love the Cheesecake Factory and have visited many across the USA over the last couple of years. The Jumbalia is my favourite. However a little disappointing at this location. Service and cheesecake were excellent. The reason for a 3 star rating is the fact that I had no choice but to pay for valet parking in front of the restaurant. Despite being a paying customer of the restaurant they still choose to sting me a little more to park.
Sarina V.,"Los Angeles, CA",801,553,1304,4.0,4/9/2013,"First time at this location. I do love cheesecake factory, I think most of their food is delicious and their cheesecakes are bomb, some dishes are lacking in flavor that I've tried in the past but I usually stick to what I know.  However this time, since I came for lunch instead of dinner, I didn't get my usual Chicken Madeira, but the new dishes I tried this time were satisfying! Once we got there, majority of the parkin lot is VALET, then a really small parking lot for self park with like 15-20 spots maybe on the right side. I REPEAT, YOU ARE NOT FORCED TO VALET, THEY HAVE THE PUNY PARKING LOT AND YOU CAN ALWAYS METER PARK ACROSS THE STREET.   I didn't want to wait for valet or pay, it's cheesecake factory, come on -__-  So we waited for awhile in the small parking lot and got a spot! First off...I loveeee their bread! Whats even better is if you order it with alfredo sauce! (5+++) The alfredo sauce is SOOOO GOOD. I'm always going to get a side of this when I come to cheescake now! Spicy Crispy Chicken Sandwich (grilled instead) (4)- cooked perfectly and good flavor! It had a nice buffalo flavor to it too! Baja Chicken Tacos (4)- yummy, came with like 4 tacos, lots of food! The flavor was really good, could have used more sauce and halfway through it became soggy and the tortillas were falling apart, thus the 4 stars. Still enjoyed the flavor and would order again, just need to eat faster! Also I reallllllyyy liked how they prepared the rice! It was with like a cilantro mixture or something.  Too full from bread to order dessert, but the service was great even on a busy easter Sunday. We pretty much got seated right away which was surprising since it seemed so busy."
Shannon T.,"Long Beach, CA",0,3,5,1.0,8/18/2015,"I visited this location and the service was AWFUL!! After waiting a long time for a table, the host walked us to a dirty table. We stood there like idiots for two minutes. No one came to our table for 15 minutes. I finally asked someone walking by who our waiter was. I complained to the manager online and she was unapologetic with a measely 25 dollar gift card. Save yourself the headache and DO NOT ATTEND this location!"
Joi S.,"Torrance, CA",1320,376,2027,4.0,5/7/2013,"I wasn't even supposed to end up here on last Sunday but what the heck...u can never really go wrong with cheesecake factory..The menu is huge so u have lots to pick from, appetizers are great, food portions are large and this location has great scenic views.  I always order something different every time depending on what I'm in the mood for. This time i tried the chicken enchiladas which were okay, nothing great..My friend ordered the salmon with potatoes and let me tell you, it was the best white creamy butter type sauce i had ever had!!! The salmon was cooked perfect, asparagus was fresh ans crispy and again that sauce alone was sooooooooooooo damn good!  The vanilla bean cheesecake is a must for me when i come here. Its so creamy and delicious."
Ana P.,"Hawthorne, CA",0,9,3,5.0,9/2/2015,"Love coming here for their chicken Madeira, I come at least once a month to the Cheesecake Factory and I have yet not had a bad experience, their staff are great I love Jazz she's a great waitress, makes sure our food comes out quick, she's very welcoming and always makes sure our cups are never empty and is constantly checking up on how our food is, the location is very beautiful u can either sit inside or out ( I always choose outside) and the view is amazing., for desert I always get the red velvet cheesecake which is the most delicious cheesecake in my opinion, I really love this location more than the marina del Rey , I just feel more welcomed here"
Luis C.,"Anaheim, CA",26,13,4,5.0,3/13/2016,Great food and service.. Really enjoy the variety of the menu!! The restaurant has a great ambiance! Would recommend for parties and family get together!! Please check out
Carlos G.,"Los Angeles, CA",19,51,28,5.0,1/18/2015,"First time here as a Yelper.  I'm giving this place a 5 star. It has been 7 years since I last ate here and just never really cross my mine to come back. But, after today, I will be back soon to eat here again.  They sat my party quickly. The waitress was very polite in helping me to decide what I should eat. I had the Chicken Bellagio and it was delicious.  This place has a valet service; I prefer to park myself thank you, they were very courteous from when I left my car to giving my ticket to the valet cashier to the valet who drove my car up to me. Total professional and with a smile on their face. Oh! One more thing, stop by the pie counter and pick up a slice of cheesecake. It took awhile but  seeing how busy they where I was patient as the cashier had a pretty smile."
Sarah C.,"Portland, OR",223,367,1217,1.0,11/15/2012,"I had an early morning flight out of PDX & didn't give myself enough time to eat breakfast. The little bag of peanuts provided on the plane wasn't enough to carry me over so by the time my plane landed in LAX I was famished. I met with my cousin, her fiancé & his family for lunch here at the Factory. This wouldn't be my first choice of places to eat & obviously we wouldn't be here if they had sought guidance through Yelp. My cousin & I ended up sharing a pizza & I ordered a glass of Pinot Grigio. The pizza was an unmemorable one. Maybe two hours later, while we're driving down the freeway, I started to feel nauseous. It was bumper-to-bumper traffic & as time passed I became worse. We finally made it to the mall where I was to meet my aunt & other cousin & I couldn't keep it in any longer. I got sick & it was embarrassing since I just met my cousin's fiancé for the first time only a few hours before. I continued to get sick throughout the wedding rehearsal & rehearsal dinner to a point where I wasn't sure if I'd make the wedding the following day. In the end I did make it feeling 100% better. I couldn't figure out if it was the food or the wine but my postprandial experience was unappreciated. I've eaten at other Cheesecake Factory's in the U.S. & it just hasn't ever tasted good to me. I don't know why it's as popular as it is. People you're wasting your time, money, calories & carbs on one star quality food. There's so much more to offer beyond the Factory. Seek & you shall find."
Nancy L.,"Torrance, CA",23,27,1,5.0,8/23/2016,"Love it here. We really just came for the cheesecake. But, we were peckish, so we ordered Chicken Bellagio to share. There was enough food to fill both of our bellies with just enough space for sharing a dutch apple a la mode."
Jen K.,"Torrance, CA",30,6,16,5.0,3/28/2015,We went here last night with my husband our waiter is so polite and very pleasant his name is DARREL B.  plus our food and drinks is so good!
Matt R.,"El Segundo, CA",109,180,98,4.0,10/25/2015,"Don't know why it's taken me so long to write one about this spot. Been coming here for years. What I like better about this location compared to Marina Del Rey is that it's bigger, and you don't feel as bunched up here while waiting for a table, though this place can get crowded. There's an upstairs area for separate parties. The other night, my party sat outside. The heat lamp provided adequate warmth, but the seating was a bit tight with the table directly behind us. That was a minor bummer. As for the rest, you should know what to expect when eating here. It's a semi-formal experience, and the atmosphere is usually pretty loud, again, this is expected. Good place to go to for large groups. Their food is great. You get what you pay for. Shrimp with Angel Hair Pasta will always be my favorite. Love the bread. Would be nice if you didn't always have to valet your car."
Brandon M.,"Long Beach, CA",0,4,,5.0,2/29/2016,Marcio was such an AMAZING waiter! He knew how to connect with my 20 month old daughter and had her grinning from ear to ear. Even had us laughing and having a great time. Will definitely be back.
Winston S.,"Hermosa Beach, CA",93,447,89,3.0,7/14/2013,"I took my buddy, Russell here for his bday on Friday.  We have been here a few times and always enjoyed it.   Our server, Morgan, was attentive and friendly.  The only thing was that our bread took a while to come out to us and there was no mention of it, so I thought maybe they stopped serving it.  It was tougher than it used to be, when it did arrive.  I ordered the rib eye, and it was decent, but kinda fatty and about 20% of it was pushed to the side, after I cut it away. Russell ordered a combo dish and loved it.  He finished it in no time, hehe.  I had the mango key lime cheesecake for dessert, and Russ had the Reese's peanut butter cheesecake.  We loved them both. I wish valet service wasn't mandatory, and self-parking was allowed."
Hannah M.,"Torrance, CA",206,24,21,5.0,8/16/2015,"If you ever go, ask for Brian or Kirsten to be your server! They're awesome! The food was great, and we had a 45 min wait which wasn't bad considering we had 15 people. The wait for the food wasn't terrible either. Great service and great food. I'm definitely going back."
Tyler D.,"Denver, CO",6,43,35,4.0,9/24/2014,"If you are looking for a dining establishment with great ambience, this is your place. It sits right on the harbor so that even if you choose the indoor seating, you get a great view of the boats in the harbor and the water looks as though it goes right up to the restaurant. The waiting staff is also very, VERY friendly and geared towards customer satisfaction. I was feeling adventurous and chose a new alcoholic beverage that I don't usually drink, and did not like it. I asked our waiter for another drink, and after he brought it out, I asked if he could please take the other (nearly full) drink away. I wasn't expecting it, but he didn't charge for the drink I had originally ordered!  Now, as for the food quality itself.... it leaves a little to long for. They aren't experts in seasoning, and the food was ok, but you could probably get a better quality at Applebees. That being said, their quality in making cheesecakes is unparalleled. Also, just be prepared that there isn't really parking in the adjacent area and they are valet only ($4)."
Vania R.,"Long Beach, CA",40,49,18,5.0,10/11/2015,They never disappoint me. I love the all of their salmon dishes specialities as well as the hibachi steak. I never eat the cheesecake. The cocktails are pretty good too. I like their skinny margarita. I come here on a regular basis. I highly recommend
