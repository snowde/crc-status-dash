Rell E.,"Los Angeles, CA",352,239,45,5.0,5/29/2014,"The Cheesecake Factory has always been consistent over the years. Great food, great service, wide selections-- all the main food genres are covered.  I like to sit on the patio, we live in Southern Cali, let's take it all in! I've been to Cheesecake Factory and even Grand Lux (now closed) many, many times over the years, but after this last visit I felt the need to post a review. I just discovered their gluten-free menu and it is amazeballs! I've never seen a restaurant offer so many gluten free options. That menu book was at least 4 pages-- pretty impressive. They even have gluten free chocolate cake. YUM!  Soooo, I'm going to have to bring CF back into my happy hour and brunch rotation. :)"
V S.,"Carson, CA",2,11,1,2.0,5/13/2016,"I ordered a cucumber lemonade to go and requested ""no ice."" When the server brought it out, I asked why it was so small. She responded that it's in a small cup because I requested no ice. She said they can't give me the normal size cup unless they fill it with ice. Really?!? For a $4.95 drink consisting of water, lemon, sugar, and cucumber?...I think not. Cheesecake Factory is getting a bit ridiculous!"
Chioma A.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,21,6,4.0,1/17/2015,"I frequent this restaurant at least twice a month. I always enjoy my meal. I always order the herb crusted salmon, with mashed potatoes and asparagus. I guess I don't like change. Some serves are better than others, but I've had a really bad one.  Always enjoyable."
Sai S.,"Carson, CA",86,81,1,4.0,10/29/2014,"Great and delectable food, but the server was fabulous! Fast, attentive, and grateful. Ask for Kento!!!! : )"
Smitha G.,"Torrance, CA",27,14,12,5.0,2/24/2015,I love cheesecake factory!! This time I got strawberry and peanut butter flavored cheesecakes. They were heavenly..:)
Alicia K.,"Lomita, CA",0,3,,5.0,2/2/2016,"Great waitress, Natalie. Very efficient, friendly and soooo sweet.  Made our dining experience very enjoyable!"
Joe V.,"Corona, CA",2,10,4,1.0,6/1/2014,"Was having a good time as possible after a memorial service at sea. I had one bloody Mary, ordered a second one and was served a virgin. (not cool). I complained my drink was weak. Julia  said it's not a virgin. I sent it back. She brought me a shot to pour in my drink... Cool, right? No! They charged me for 2 bloody marys AND a shot..... Not the way I wanted to memorialize someone."
Sherry A.,"Redondo Beach, CA",0,16,,4.0,5/7/2016,"Please, please, please get window blinds. It's ridiculous trying to eat with the sun blasting you in the eyes and face. It doesnt make any sense."
David S.,"Redondo Beach, CA",0,3,,1.0,9/4/2015,"I wish I could give less than one star.  I did have a three paragraph rant prepared... But since I asked to speak to the manager after the parking attendant insulted me and said, ""when you come back later it might be different "" in his broken Spanglish. (Obviously threatening to vandalize my car)... The manager 'was too busy to take my call'... I figured what's the use with a detailed rant. I will say, if the owners care...this had been a preferred restraunt to take clients and out of town guest. My companies employees spend 700. - 1500 a week entertaining client. I have heard complaints about service and parking but looked the other way. As a result of my personal experience, Monday morning I ordered my entire staff the this establishment is off limits for any company expeditures. Why did I post this? they don't care! (Our ledger reflects we spent 14700 dollars there last fiscal year and they are loosing that to a quite receptive and wonderful neighbor. It's not the one jerky employee, but the managers lack of interest to listen and address the issue)"
Raquel M.,"Rancho Palos Verdes, CA",3,12,2,1.0,1/15/2016,"Very very disappointed in my experience tonight at this location. We planned a surprise dinner here for my mother because it's her favorite place for dessert. We had two waiters that never seemed to care to check up on us. It wasn't that busy for a Friday night either. They took our orders and only brought out half the items and we had to keep reminding them we still were missing drinks, utensils, etc. We were charged for the wine which was never brought to us, the waiter never brought my father a straw after asking 3 times for one which was starting to get annoying at that point. We finally had to ask for a manager and much to my surprise he was not at all that helpful. Never once did he apologize for what was supposed to be a nice dining experience for my mothers birthday. Definitely won't be coming back."
Bonnie W.,"Los Angeles, CA",96,45,22,4.0,4/6/2015,"We were visiting and had lunch here with friends. We ate out in the patio which was a nice relaxed view of the marina. I was impressed that their glutenfree menu had improved (even a GF cheesecake which was delicious). I had the chicken caesars salad (without croutons), which was very large. It was very good, too."
Liz C.,"Upper West Side, Manhattan, NY",13,17,8,1.0,5/1/2014,"We were a table of 7 people, we ordered the food after 10 mins, it took 40 min for the food to come, and after it finely was all on the table it wasn't even warm...  The waitress was very kind and came all the time to check on us and once we lost our patients and said we're not saticfied, she called the manager which was so rude!  He said we are only waiting 35 mins (which is also a lot, but- we definitely waited for at least 40 as we texted someone right after we ordered so we we tracked the time. After I clarified we are not satisfied with the whole experience he still didn't give a damn, and completely ignored our complaints...   Unfortunate and very disappointing..."
Bri K.,"Torrance, CA",20,5,4,3.0,8/26/2015,"Enjoy the bread, it will taste good, with butter even better, like it should. My food was timely, the service was nice, This place you'll enjoy more or less for the price. The food looked good, and was filling, yet felt unsatisfied. The dessert the same, was not wowed, could have done with or without. Overall if you want medium upscale slightly above average tasting good looking cuisine then come down to the Cheesecake Factory and you'll see what I mean."
Ivana B.,"Redondo Beach, CA",39,20,5,4.0,3/13/2013,"First let me say that this is my favorite Cheesecake location to go to simply because of the staff and its outdoor seating. Moving on... The parking situation can be tricky if you go during their busy hours (duh) but it's valet so you only have to deal with it until you get to the front of the line. Parking is $4. There's always people who are a bit fishy when it comes to valet parking but I've never had a problem here. They open the door for you, tell you everything you need to know, and send you on your way. When it's time to go home they get your car to you ASAP, they run to it like they're in some kind of competition. It's especially appreciated during cold nights. I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE their outdoor seating. The entire time you're eating you have a view of all the boats docked at the harbor. During the day you have the sun shining with a pleasant breeze and when the sun begins to set it looks really pretty. For those colder nights you find yourself sitting outside they have heaters which definitely do their job because I have never been cold out there but I always have issues when I go to other places.  Indoor seating is pretty much 'seen one, seen all' as far as Cheesecake goes. There's  nothing really special. I've eaten inside once and I have no complaints, I just prefer sitting outdoors.  Now, the staff. Umm I wish these people worked EVERYWHERE. I have never once had an issue with anyone who has been assigned to my table. There's never been an attitude and most of the time I end up having a great conversation with them. For my last birthday at one point we carried on a lengthy conversation with someone who wasn't even assigned to us, he was so animated and hilarious! I definitely love that I never have to worry about how my service is going to be when I go here, they have won me over.  The food is your regular Cheesecake food, there's nothing special here that you can't find in other locations. My favorite thing to get would have to be the sweet corn tamale cakes, which are great for sharing with the entire table, and the herb crusted fillet of salmon. The salmon comes with mashed potatoes and asparagus with some kind of sauce. It's my go-to dish if I don't want to flip pages. The cheesecake...there are no flaws. My favorite is the basic strawberry one but I've tried many of them and they all are sooooo good. During the holidays they always seem to throw in a new flavor so if you're a fan of christmas candy chances are one of those will end up being an inspiration for their season cheesecake."
Booker P.,"Hermosa Beach, CA",0,17,,3.0,5/7/2016,"I used to eat here all the time, and after not visiting them for several years went twice in one week. The place is apply named, a factory where the service is fast and efficient- and you feel like an item on the assembly line being pushed along. The food does come out fast but they appear to be cutting corners to achieve the speed.     For appetizers we ordered a tamale dish, and it was amazing- sweet little corn cakes with a cilantro sauce. We also had some chips with delicious fresh guacamole.    As an entree, I ordered two of my old favorites, the Cajun pasta and Evelyn's pasta. In both dishes it appeared that the pasta was prepared ahead of time and allowed to dry out before the sauce was added. For the Cajun pasta the linguini was clumped together as we have all seen happen when pasta sits in a colander after being cooked. A bit over cooked, on the mushy side, too. The Evelyn's had a different problem- way too much oil and the rigatoni had a rubbery texture. One other person in our party of six ordered the same dish and had a similar comment about chewing on rubber. My guess is they make these ahead of time and let them sit under a heat lamp. Some advice- call Gordon Ramsay for a review of the methods in your kitchen and an update to that stuck in the eighties menu.    I always liked the atmosphere, sitting by Redondo's sleepy little small craft harbor where you can catch a view of the sunset. It is disappointing to see an enormous wall has been built on one side of the property, just a few feet from their outdoor patio, blocking the view to the north practically from the street to the water. I don't understand how they allowed the hotel developer to build such an eyesore. This restaurant has given Redondo Beach millions of dollars over the years. Surely the Cheesecake Factory management could have fought to stop this monstrosity from being built, or at least restrict it to a reasonable size."
Robert F.,"Torrance, CA",0,5,,4.0,8/26/2015,"My wife and I eat lunch their regularly and usually enjoy it. Stay away from a manager named Justin, the guy doesn't know what he is doing..."
Gabriel P.,"El Segundo, CA",144,26,4,1.0,6/16/2016,"Just came home from celebrating my sons 8th grade promotion. Some of the worst service and lack of accountability I've seen with a restaurant of this caliber (which is above average) for our family. My plate came out 20 minutes after my party was complete. Our server simply asked if I wanted to take my order to go, I asked to remove it from bill, which resulted in no dinner for me and a fat bill minus my food that never came. She acted as if she was doing something good for us by asking to package it to go (yet still charge me for it). I asked for bill, and that took another 30 minutes to arrive. The server didn't offer to pack up our leftovers but simply handed us boxes and bags (even when we asked if they could pack it for us). All we received was a blank stare and a shrug followed by her exiting the table. After asking to speak to manager he took our bill went to back and came with new bill minus two appetizers and the plate I never received. In my eyes he made no effort to save our business at this location, especially after telling him we eat at cheesecake factory often. I will go out of my way to drive further to another location in LA. To top it off, our server never came once to check on us or are if we needed anything..our party was 7 people. Needless to say this sucks, but even more so that this was the place my son chose to eat it to celebrate his middle school promotion. Even after all that I still bought cheesecake to go because the server never asked if we wanted dessert. How can you go to cheesecake factory and not be offered cheesecake? Oh..forgot to add that I was offered an unsolicited bowl of orange soup while I waited..had no idea what kind it was not was I told what it was..I told them no thank you and watched them take the same soup to a table a few rows down? Have no idea what that was about??"
Michael K.,"Huntington Beach, CA",42,71,174,1.0,4/12/2014,"Arrived at The Cheesecake Factory willing and excited to have lunch.  Was well takin care of by our first server, only to find he was a ""break-server"" (meaning he was filling in for our real server.). When he introduced us to our real server we were disappointed.  The high level of care our break-server gave us was quickly downgraded to a server that took 5-8 minutes to refill our drinks, bring us dessert, and bring the check.  No one wants to wait around for dessert and then wait for the check.  I almost didn't want to eat my cheesecake in protest!  But it was a ""Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake. Oh well, the sacrifices one must make.  Alas, I will not be returning to this Cheesecake Factory.   Finally, after paying up my $50.00 for lunch, I was still expected to pay for parking, which by the way is the only way you can park.  Yes, valet is the only way to enjoy this Cheesecake Factory and you must pay with cash or be advised to walk to The Crowne Plaza hotel with an ATM in the lobby.  This is a good 10-15 minute walk across Catalina and back.  No signs to advise you cash only, the parking guy told me ""the Cheesecake Factory wouldn't let him post it at the podium when you are forced to valet because its tacky.  So remember!! **THE PARKING ONLY TAKES CASH**."
Ron Mexic O.,"Beverly Hills, CA",10,25,1,2.0,9/18/2015,"This is a review about Cheesecake Factory in general. Not just this location.  I've been to many different Cheesecake Factories around L.A. The service and facility is the same across the board, very good. Everything is usually clean, the servers are nice and attentive, I'm usually there for a special occasion, people are happy, and the food is good. Corporate must be cutting costs because I've noticed a steady decline in the past few years. Portions have gotten smaller and the ingredients and quality are not what they used to be. Add this to rising prices and this may be the last time I go to Cheesecake Factory for a while if ever again.  What corporate and management fail to realize is that most people go to Cheesecake Factory for special occasions and/or want a meal that is not typical and will therefore pay accordingly. They can dim the lights all they want and upgrade the architecture to Michaelangelo or Da Vinci levels, but the bottomline is the food has to be up to par...it no longer is.  Food-wise they're approaching Denny's status."
Christina V.,"Anaheim, CA",2,49,3,2.0,8/5/2014,"I have expierenced better. My family and I went to CCF yesterday during lunch and there was 2 lady's in the front , didnt greet us quickly asked how many of us were there. We asked if we could sit outside and the lady said sure give me a second let me see where I can seat you. We finally went outside and the lady was going to put us in the sun (with a 10 month old baby). When we asked if we can get somewhere outside in the shade she said no because there was going to be a party there in a little, (BUT I THOUGHT THERE WAS NOOO RESERVATIONS)?.  We finally just said ok lets just go sit inside. Our server was Alberto he was pretty nice, professional, and very patient.  We ordered our food quickly, got our drinks,and bread. I would say that the only thing that is wrong with this place is that some staff are and look very un-professional. I think the manager was discussing a problem with another worker infront of us. OVERALL 2 STARS IS ENOUGH..."
