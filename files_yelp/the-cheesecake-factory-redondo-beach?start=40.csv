Rowena A.,"Los Angeles, CA",53,90,94,4.0,8/22/2017,"It was crowded this night but nothing negative to say.  I know what to expect.  It seemed as if the place was a little short staffed or the employees were exhausted from a busy day.  A few of the waiters dropped plates and beverages but good thing the customers were very understanding and polite.  My plate was dropped but luckily it didn't spill on me.  Apparently the plate was really hot.  Our waitress recommended some really good cheesecakes that we ordered and took home to eat later.   I love this location, right on the marina.   You can see the boats and water.  Such a good change from the typical cheesecake factories or restaurants."
Mina D.,"Los Angeles, CA",79,284,6,4.0,8/29/2017,"Comparing to the Marina del Rey location, we found this place to be a little more efficient.   It was crowded (tons of birthdays) yet we were seated quickly.  Valet parking was $4 and quick. Food arrived hot and fast, though the bar took a little while on our margarita. The margarita was TWICE as big and TWICE as strong than Marina del Rey, so we'd go back to this location just for the cocktail generosity. Our server was OK---definitely a personality clash with us.  I think he thought he was being funny or witty, but sounded more condescending than anything.   Things were said like ""whoa, that's a lot of food"" and ""man, that steak didn't have a chance, huh?!?""  were just not appreciated by us as we were eating, especially since the tone came across as very judgmental.    Other things were said but I think in this case we just wanted him to shut up and stop interrupting with his snarky comments. Overall, we liked the location & would consider the drive to return here over Marina del Rey."
Peter K.,"Manhattan Beach, CA",473,35,28,5.0,8/13/2017,"Exquisite location on the Redondo beach marina. So many options for food, drinks, desserts. Honestly cheesecake outdid themselves. Great vibe and ambiance low light setting. The menu is huge and the portions are extremely generous. I personally am a fan of the super antioxidant salad + add side of chicken on top. It's super healthy and delicious! Between the pastas, specialties, burgers, etc you can't go wrong! Highly recommend! You can also choose self parking or valet. They seat huge parties so it's ideal for events and huge reservations."
E. B.,"Redondo Beach, CA",14,59,5,2.0,11/7/2017,"SLOW 20 minutes to get waters!, inattentive staff, freezing inside, and ridiculously dark. The food selection is fabulous but the flavor is average at best. Just not worth the money. Slow waitstaff on more than one visit, shows they have no intention of improving."
Frederick B.,"Lomita, CA",0,9,,1.0,12/27/2017,"I have been to many Cheesecake Factory but this one is at the bottom of the list. The food had no flavor like it was taken out of the freezer and put into an oven. I brought the whole family and got seated in a non lit table... not the romantically lit, just no light. My cocktail did not have any alcohol in it along with my wife, which both got sent back. Far from being impressed, but at least my bill was high... yay!"
Zelda Z.,"Fort Worth, TX",68,17,11,4.0,9/14/2017,This place was great! We sat outside in the chilly weather they had heaters and it was perfect along with the cute view. Great breakfast
Madelyne M.,"San Pedro, San Pedro, CA",0,11,,1.0,12/27/2017,"Sat about 20 minutes before a server even came over and greeted us. I get that sometimes sections can become confusing once servers start getting cut (I work in a restaurant) but I thought maybe the meal will make up for it.  I don't eat meat so I ordered the four cheese pasta. First of all, it tasted like a frozen meal. Second of all, I didn't finish it so I got a box to take it to go (no way in hell I'm paying that much to not finish my meal even though it tasted frozen). When I was emptying the rest of my pasta into the bowl I found what looked like chewed up beef. It was the most disgusting thing ever."
Tiffany L.,"Torrance, CA",2,63,,4.0,11/6/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory is pretty much self-explanatory.  This huge restaurant chain serves so much good food. The menu has so much to choose from so there is always a hit-or-miss menu (for example, orange chicken and Jamaican black pepper shrimp). But, there's always more good food than bad ones. Whenever we go to visit, we love to order spicy chipotle pasta (which is a must-order dish!), crispy crab bites, nashvill hot chicken nuggets, roasted pear and blue cheese flatbread, crab and artichoke dip, miso salmon, steak diane, and bang bang chicken and shrimp. We go to the Cheesecake Factory every once a month so we tried so many other dishes as well but cannot remember all at the moment.  The portion sizes are large enough to share with everyone at the table.  There is nothing to say about their original cheesecake because it's just so good and melts in your mouth.  Customer service is excellent. However, during lunch hours the service is noticeably more slower for some reason. They are always packed on holidays and wait is little long on weekend nights so always try to go on weekdays for better food and service. Try to sit outdoors because inside is always too loud and the wait is shorter for outside seating."
Khristine C.,"Santa Monica, CA",169,117,98,4.0,7/1/2016,"The location for this specific Cheesecake Factory is amazing. I mean, right on the marina? It's the perfect date spot! I saw a lot of couples on dates and anniversaries here while I dined with family. The hostess was very pleasant and sat us right away. 6pm on a weekday is the perfect time to come as when we were leaving around 7.30, there was a line out the door.  Our server David was very nice but all his ""lines"" seemed rehearsed. He misinformed us about an appetizer we ordered but he was very gracious and apologetic when I pointed it out. It wasn't a big deal. 5 stars for him.  The food here is never that great but people come because they're BIG PORTIONS. Mashed potatoes with the shrimp scampi was delicious. The chicken piccata was good too but after a while you get sick of it cos it's very rich. Jambalaya pasta, STAY AWAY if you've ever had jambalaya elsewhere or even know what it is. The jambalaya here should be renamed as chicken with bell peppers (not spicy at all).  All in all it was a pleasant experience. I've been here about 10 yrs ago when I first moved to the US. Wasn't impressed then, isn't impressed now. The service is what gave this place my 4 stars. The hostess, our server, and the Filipino valet guy were all so great and professional."
Cathy The Cat C.,"Manhattan Beach, CA",2,31,5,3.0,12/26/2017,the food here is hashtag amaze balls yo! i love love love their pasta and chocolate shakes! my kids get the kids meal and it's quite a big portion!!!!!!!!server anthony... do yo self a favor and please switch servers if u get him! he's mean and mean and mean.
Erick L.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,91,4,1.0,9/28/2017,"Once upon a time there was a cheesecake factory. This is probably one of the worst locations that they have!  It's run down, poor management and customer service. This place is dirty, most of the staff are not professional! The food is horrible! The portions are small. I can go on and on! Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else!"
Maria C.,"Los Angeles, CA",91,15,7,5.0,8/22/2017,"If i can give them 10 stars i would!! Our waitress Irene was absolutely THE BEST! I wanted to cry n hug her!!! Seriously! My husband and I went to celebrate our anniversary and we were so undecided on what to pick. She suggested an appetizer for us and my entre!! I must say the fried mac and cheese balls were to die for! And the Chicken Bellagio plate was the best!!! We had the best service! But u know what else, she went above and beyond to make sure we had the best experience! By bringing out our dessert with ""Happy Anniversary to you"" That was it!! She made our night!! To the manager at this location, Irene is a keeper!!! She was beyond the best!!! Thank u! We had the best experience here and the food was amazing!!! Plus the view was the best!! We felt like royalty there!"
Ashley C.,"Grand Terrace, CA",21,7,4,5.0,5/22/2017,"This review is specific for the special events team. This past April I had my wedding reception on the 2nd floor of the Cheesecake Factory. Jackie, Addie and Danny were all great at staying in communication with me during the planning process. Unfortunately I procrastinated and in the last 2 weeks I had to bombard them with e-mails to follow up on last minute items. They were all very professional and helped me plan everything to the last minute.  I was also concerned because the restaurant is still open during the whole event and I was worried I would feel like we did not have enough privacy. However on the day of the event we had all the privacy we needed. Our dj was still able to blast his music, we danced, talked and was able to be loud if we wanted. The food was great and best of all very affordable for the area.  My wedding was everything I visioned it to be and it would not have been possible without the staff and amazing space that the Cheesecake Factory provided. Thank you again!"
Ryan N.,"Hermosa Beach, CA",118,106,,4.0,10/25/2017,"Oh yeah, this place is always a staple for date nights. Killer sunsets and great cheesecakes, naturally. The main courses are pretty good but nothing too special. Again, view and cheesecake. Try to come early but this place can really fill up for dinner. Seriously, this wait has deterred many in the past. Overall solid choice for dinner, but only for the right occasion."
Mika B.,"Los Angeles, CA",141,7,1,5.0,11/5/2017,"This is my Favorite cheesecake I always go to the one in Marina but I have came to this location only twice and it's way better than the one in Marina. I came today with my mother and brother, we were seated in a timely manner and the waitress I didn't catch her name but she was a very sweet blonde young woman. She was great very nice got our food and drinks to our table very fast and the food was delicious! We eat a lot we're big people who like to eat and none of us finished our plates the portions were so big! The waitress had to leave and she left us with another blonde woman with curly hair and glasses who was also pretty awesome. No complaints everything about the service and the food was just delightful."
Michelle K.,"San Diego, CA",172,83,327,5.0,4/21/2016,"I have frequented this location over the past couple of years- and am always met with exceptional service, a great view, and tasty dishes.  Our waitress Sara is lovely! :) She recommended a couple of dishes that were delectable, and was so pleasant and friendly every time she checked up on us.  Altogether, the staff are friendly. The Valet even pointed us to an area where parking is free. (avoiding the 4$ charge) Not only that, one of the servers (who brought out our dishes + showered the pasta in cheese) went out of his way to bring our table Sriracha, even though for some reason the bottle exploded on him when he opened it! (he came back with splatters on his shirt), + with a HUGE grin and good attitude despite that happening.  The view is beautiful. It adds to creating a pleasant ambiance! I would definitely recommend bringing a date or your mama here :)  yum: -Sweet Corn Tamale cakes (has sour cream, salsa, avocado & salsa verde). It reminds me of corn bread, with a twist! -Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta (has chicken, asparagus, peppers, peas, garlic, etc). This pasta dish has so many different textures, and comes in abundance! My friend and I split this dish and didn't even finish the whole thing. It leans toward the creamier side, but is delish to have once in awhile.  -Carrot Cheesecake (ONE OF MY FAVORITES)"
Jaj A.,"Whittier, CA",0,15,6,5.0,8/13/2017,"This is our favorite TCF, it's truly worth the drive because the wait is always reasonable compared to other locations. When you get here you pull into a driveway lined with beautifully lit trees. Our go to order is the shrimp scampi and for dessert the tiramisu cheesecake. Shout out to the support staff here. The bus boy and bread guy who also packed up our left overs for their great service."
Kazu F.,"Fullerton, CA",138,14,32,4.0,3/10/2017,"Kinda over did it on refeed day...so full, but worth it. Got there at around 6:30 on a Friday night, and already pretty crowded. They don't allow everyone to be seated until the entire party here but luckily the people we were meeting up with were already there. Never been there at night, but the interior was dimly lit, great for an intimate date night out. Unfortunately, the place we were sat didn't have any direct light over so reading the menu and eating got to be a little difficult. We started off with the chicken taquitos, the Nashville nuggets, and the calamari. The chicken tacquitos were great, definitely a huge upgrade compared to any hole in the wall Mexican take out place. Nashville nuggets had a spicy flavor that went great with the ranch it came in. The entree I got was the chicken maderie with the herb crusted salmon. Came with a side of mashed potatoes and string beans. The salmon could've used some more salt/flavor, but the sauce that the chicken came with went great with the mushrooms on the side. For desert we had the cheesecake, tiramisu cheesecake, and the apple pie, damn we were stuffed. The cheesecake was pretty dense but delicious, whereas the tiramisu cheesecake was much lighter. Last but not least, love the bread and butter that comes with it."
Erik V.,"Los Angeles, CA",280,91,68,5.0,7/8/2017,I'm a super fan of Cheesecake Factory. Food is always great and our server is always friendly. Great thing about this cheesecake is its right next to the water!  Get outside seating in the summer.
Barbi O.,"Rancho Palos Verdes, CA",379,43,57,5.0,9/20/2017,"Ordered the red velvet cheesecake and it was heavenly. Usually the place is packed with people, this day was slow so we got served right away. Very friendly and attentive staff and delicious cheesecake."
