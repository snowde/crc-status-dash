Cindy R.,"Temecula, CA",66,21,25,4.0,10/23/2014,"This place has a nice atmosphere, the prices are not bad considering the location and good food. The burgers are delicious and meat loaf is really good too. The waiter helped with great food and dessert suggestions. The velvet cheesecake is amazing."
Ely S.,"Lomita, CA",1,10,,3.0,8/12/2015,"I'm leaving them a 3* review because I'm giving the the benefit of the doubt here, but I will happily pull my review and issue a 2* or lower if my next experience isn't better. The Pros:   1. They seated my party of 10 after 15 minutes when we were told it would be about an hour. 2. The staff was courteous, prompt, attentive but not intrusive, and accommodating. 3. The appetizers, and cheesecake were amazing.  The entree's were above average for everyone but myself, however to be fair, I ordered something that I typically wouldn't order because I was feeling adventurous, so I am going to give them a pass on that. The Cons: 1. They basically require that you use their valet service to park your car and then they charge you for it.  I would expect an establishment of this perceived class to comp the valet if they are going to require that you use it. 2. Upon arrival we were told that one member of our party had to wait in a special area for the manager who was walking around the restaurant surveying open tables and availability to come and quote you a time to seating.  The rest of my party was told to wait in the bar.  This was a family birthday dinner for my daughter, so I was required to be separated from my family on my daughters birthday so that I could wait for 15 minutes so that the manager could tell me that it was going to be an hour until they could seat us.  They provided me with a buzzer, why couldn't they have told me that they were going to alert me as to when the manager was available to speak with me? 3. The bar menu doesn't list pricing for cocktails.  Had I known the bottom shelf, weak and flavorless martini's were going to be $12 each, I would not have ordered them.  At least I know for next time."
Dean Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",200,545,9,1.0,5/17/2013,"Been coming here for a long time, but the food was about par for the night. The valet parking is the worst at this location.  I noticed that the valet person parked the car very close to the other car and when he went to get my car, he went so fast around the lot, the wheels were squealing.   Then he acts like nothing was wrong.   Nevertheless I saw a ding mark after I got home.  I know that they did it cause its a brand new car. Never valet at this location."
Denise L.,"Santa Clara, CA",971,2304,3723,4.0,7/10/2012,"This is probably the best CF in California. Why? Right on the water! I've been to a handful of CF's, and by far, if you get a seat by the window, such a gorgeous view of the marina. Or better yet, a table outdoors!  Tried the thai chicken pasta, shared with my aunt since they always give you way too much food. It was different but good. Loved the peanut sauce. Service is ample here, same as you'd fine anywhere, but really, it's all about the view and the endless choices at Cheesecake Factory."
Jamie A.,"Escondido, CA",507,530,1309,4.0,5/17/2011,"This review is for Happy Hour since I hate eating in the regular dining room especially during peak times at this place!   (Loud children and hordes of people wandering about?  No thanks). Do you like $5 mojitos that are actually made correctly and  $5 appetizers?  Pretty good deal at the waterfront.   You can also get the red velvet cheescake (I always get it to go) but all cake is regular price during HH.  Get the sweet corn cake which is my fav item here and pass on their soggy, boring calamari. The waiters can be a bit slow, but not for laziness...just because the place is always packed.  Last time I checked valet went up to an unnecessary $3.50.  Bring 4 or 5 quarters, park at the meters on the street and get some exercise!"
Nina R.,"Harbor City, CA",29,13,9,5.0,1/15/2016,"I love Cheesecake Factory, it is really good ! The place is really nice, i like to come there and stay for a while to enjoy my meal in front of the marina. Proportions are big, there is a lot a choice, everyone can find something they like ,and the pasta and cheesecakes are perfect. Plus: enjoy the delicious warm bread with butter, while picking your dish on the menu and/or waiting for the food."
James B.,"Grand Prairie, TX",1,57,4,5.0,6/2/2015,"Went back to Cheesecake and ordered the Rib Eye again.  Steak was way overlooked this time, but the manager came and apologized and they cooked me another one.  Service was great!  Josh was our server and he did a great job continuously checking on us.  Still don't like the mandatory valet."
Emil B.,"Anaheim, CA",20,5,1,1.0,8/30/2015,"Very bad service. After 45 min. Waiting for some body comes to our table, and take the order. Is the first time in all my life. When I want to order and the waitress answer me :Sorry I can't take the order, I'm very busy. If you want to order talk to the manager. The waitress yelled me, showing no class or etiquette.   I did talk with two managers, and we had to wait an other 20 min. Food quality and service VERY BAD ! I do not recommend The Cheese Cale Factory in Redondo Beach.  Sat August 29th diner time !"
Kerry B.,"Los Angeles, CA",13,46,170,2.0,9/30/2014,"This was my first time going to my favorite restaurant chain on the west coast and I was disappointed at the service. I ordered a shrimp scampi and cheesecake which in and of themselves were good. A little too much lemon in the scampi but still awesome nonetheless. I got my food to go and didn't dine in. Usually for takeout orders if I have a few spare dollars I'll throw it in a tip jar or just tip in person. Today was one of the days I didn't have some extra dollars. Usually for dine-ins I tip 20% and up. Well I guess the cashier may have took it to heart. First of all, when I ordered on the phone the lady asked me if I'd like bread and butter and I told her sure, whole wheat. I paid for the order before the food came out of course. When it finally arrived, the cashier looked at the signed receipt and then came the change. It was only the shrimp scampi, no bread. I told her politely I asked for bread, she asked me what kind (hello, didn't I already specify on the phone with my order someone wrote down?) went to the back, came round and said it was all gone, do I want sourdough (yuck). Then she asked if I needed utensils, I said sure and then I arrive home and there's no utensils! I don't want to make a mountain out of a mole hill but to me it seems suspect. I hope I am wrong but I doubt it. Not getting the utensils despite her asking me and motioning as if to put it in the bag is what aroused my suspicions. I don't think I'll be getting takeout there again. Maybe I'll take my business to Marina Del Ray next time I'm in the mood for Cheesecake Factory!"
Alyssa J.,"Los Angeles, CA",8,4,1,4.0,5/5/2015,"I came here on a Saturday afternoon for a friend's birthday dinner. Our server Adrian was amazing. Three of those stars are for him and his great service. He rattled off the daily specials without missing a beat and had a smile on his face the whole time. We asked him a question about one of the drinks and he gave his honest opinion, which being a server I can appreciate. Our drinks did take a little while to come out but we saw he had a large party and he was apologetic and came back often to check on us. Our meal was delicious and served piping hot. I had the chicken bellagio and it was amazing. Anything with prosciutto has me sold. My boyfriend got the  margherita pizza and it was good too. My friend got the chicken Madeira and told me to find the recipe for it because she liked it so much. We ordered some cheesecakes to go because it was fight night and the boys were getting restless. The only thing that spoiled the note was actually right toward the beginning of the meal before we had even sat down.  We were given the option of dining room or patio and since it was nearing sunset we chose the patio. When we were being walked to our table we noticed it was a little far and we were passing a lot of empty tables. We kept walking father back. We were sat at the absolute last table on the patio, next to the server station where you can hear their conversations, people would pass by us with trays of dishes and when the drop the plates down it sounded pretty loud . It was a little noisy so my friend's husband asked if we could be sat somewhere closer to the middle or even the table next to us which had a great view of the water. She said no that table wasn't available. We didn't question any further because we just wanted to have a good time. About 2 minutes passed and they came back and we're going to sit three men at a table in the middle but asked to sit at the same table we tried to sit at. They led them straight to it while at my table we all just kind of looked at each other. My friend told me that she kind of felt discriminated against because we didn't get a choice when three white men did. Were all pretty young and Hispanic. Other than this, the dinner and service was great. Maybe next time we'll choose to sit inside."
Anjelica C.,"Newport Beach, CA",87,29,11,4.0,11/16/2014,"This was my first visit to this location. I came for my cousin's birthday dinner and was pleasantly surprised we didn't have to wait long to be seated for a party of 10. Our table was behind the hostess but it was secluded enough that we hardly noticed. The view from the table was also amazing. The server, Obi, was great. He was attentive and friendly. The food was delicious and the cheesecakes didn't disappoint. I highly recommend this place for large groups and family dinners. An additional plus, the skinny drink and meal menu."
Asle L.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,64,17,4.0,1/2/2016,"good location, service, and food... Everyone in my party got his order, except me...after waiting for about 10 minutes, I told the waiter...the manager then came over and apologized and offered me a free salad while I was waiting for my order...she also took off my order of the bill to make up for it..."
Jorge G.,"Lawndale, CA",0,13,26,3.0,12/29/2015,"Came here last night, I ordered the Chinese chicken salad (delicious), ordered the spicy cashew chicken with rice, rice seemed so bland and chicken tasted old and was not spicy. Cheesecake and service were both great!"
Jeff R.,"Redondo Beach, CA",20,191,,4.0,1/25/2013,Big portions !  Good food ! Yessir... you will always bring home a doggie bag for your fat roommate if you go to this place... 3000 calorie servings people. The pasta is super amazing... we get the Cajun pasta... or the basic Chicken pasta bowties.  Split a serving ??  Or take it home to Big Bertha. Did you say Cake ?  Cheesie Cake ?   We've tried half of the flavors.  Darn good. No Damn Good.    How do they make those cakes ?  So decadent....  Its sinful. You have to go to church 3 times to cleanse the decadence after eating there. YUM TOWN !
Donna S.,"Glendora, CA",334,752,4899,3.0,4/11/2012,"Normally not a fan of chains or Cheesecake Factory, so I was not happy this was the lunch place of choice. Especially since we are all the way out in Redondo beach and going to a restaurant that is just right around the corner from us back at home! Really??  But I had not been to a Cheesecake Factory in years (unless I was picking up a cheesecake which I DO recommend) and I was pleasantly surprised to a section of small plates/tapas in the tome of a menu!  Right up my alley! I was able to talk one of the other guests at the table into sharing several small plates and having a tapas style meal.  The bread is still good just as I remember it. Chewy, dense, whole grain or squaw style.  I sipped on my Strawberry martini while enjoying the view of boats bobbing on the water.  And when all the little tapas arrived, I must say I was pleasantly surprised. The Pear gorgonzola flatbread was nice. I do however prefer the pear cut into thinner slices blanketed over the bread so there is a more perfect amount of pear in each bite. These were big cubes sprinkled on so some bites had too much pear, and other bites no pear at all.  The white bean hummus was very nice and creamy. Good texture.  Stuffed mushrooms were bathed in a nice sauce and very flavorful.  But the highlight for me was the wonderful kale salad. It's so nice to see raw kale salads more often when I go out. I usually  have to make these at home myself. The others companions with me didn't  even know you could eat kale raw. They all loved this salad. I would probably be willing to go back to CF to try more of the small plates and get more kale salad. Still never on the top of my list to go to, but now I won't bitch if someone else picks it."
Mark C.,"Torrance, CA",129,576,668,2.0,8/8/2012,"First off, you're forced to use the valet which costs $3.50. If you're looking for a nice, cozy place to eat where you can view the ocean, you're not gonna find it here. This Cheesecake Factory is usually busy and packed.  Our waiter Darren was a complete gentlemen who was very knowledgeable about the menu and the current discounts of the day. I ordered a spicy chicken sandwich. I did have to wait a little longer for whatever reason to get my order but at least the sandwich was quite delicious. The salad that came with it wasn't so bad either.  But looking at the name of this place, I just simply had to try out an actual cheesecake. We ordered a whole pie... Hrm, that sounds awkward... What do you call a whole circle of cheesecake anyway? In any case, I have to say that I was disappointed with it. For a place to be called Cheesecake Factory and not have the ability to churn out superb cheesecake is as disappointing as everyone in your life forgetting it's your birthday.  You know, if we're gonna have to pay $3.50 for valet, I expect them to retrieve my car in a timely fashion. We had to wait outside far longer than we had to. It actually would have been faster for us to walk to our car and drive out of there ourselves.  Finally, I didn't see any Vultures, Siege Tanks, Hellions, Thors, or Goliaths around. I asked if they used an infernal pre-igniter upgrade to defrost their cheesecakes. All I got was a look of bewilderment. Oh well, it doesn't seem like there's a tech lab attached to this factory."
Miguel R.,"Los Angeles, CA",643,894,860,4.0,3/28/2012,"Cheesecake and Factory aren't really appealing words on their own and put together to name a restaurant they are not very appealing either. Not very creative. I'm not going to judge this book by its cover though. Oh, and I am not the typical Yelper that gives chain restaurants a default 3 every time haha! MINUS ONE STAR THOUGH FOR THE FACT YOU HAVE TO USE A VALET TO PARK HERE! NEEDLESS TO SAY IT IS NOT FREE! UGH! Anyway, the host and hostess that greeted us were very courteous. The lobby is quite cute. They have white doves painted up above. Both times we have been here we have been seated by the windows which afford a great view of the marina! Simply romantic, and I mean even on a night which isn't really supposed to be romantic. There's nothing like the shimmering reflection of lights on the ocean! The walls are painted a nice yellowish color and the ceiling is covered with material that makes for good acoustics. The lighting is great! Very romantic for something like a factory that serves cheesecake haha! We started off with Grilled Artichokes. My BF who loves them says they do them exceptionally well here. I enjoyed them too. They are served with a vinaigrette type sauce and an aioli type sauce. I ordered the Miso Salmon. Superb! Great portion of salmon and great portion of white rice. It tastes like a subtle combination of miso paste and teriyaki sauce. It's on the sweet side. Very tasty! Fresh crisp snowpeas accompany the salmon as garnishes. The presentation is gorgeous. My only critique would be of the buttery sauce they add around the rice. It really seems to be just part of the garnishing and it's not tasty at all. The Orange Chicken my BF ordered was really, really good. It's a very filling plate. I think that this is among the best Orange Chicken plates I have ever had! The chicken is flavorful and soft. The taste of orange is not terribly subtle. It's just right. Our servers have been very attentive and friendly both times. They were so good at their job we made remarks about it at the dinner table. This place is a pleasant surprise. Most chain restaurants tend to get three stars on Yelp. This is a good example of why even chain restaurants should be reviewed since the managers make a big difference. There is also the fact each restaurant has its idiosyncrasies. This one has its nice view and the deplorable parking situation (both times we have been here we could see no reason for the need of valet parking since the lot did not get full). Thanks to the ambience and service and quality of the food I highly recommend this restaurant. What did Elites think about this place? The overall Elite rating of this place is 3.4 stars. I only used page 1 of the Elite ratings to get this overall rating."
Vaishnovi K.,"Brea, CA",58,148,67,3.0,1/28/2013,"I love Cheesecake Factory and never have any complaints about their food. We got the Tex Mex Eggrolls, Cajun Jambalaya Pasta & White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle Cheesecake..everything was yum! The reason I'm taking 2 stars away was for the service. Our waitress seemed very rushed the entire evening and forgot to get us stuff like lemon for the water, straws and the bread (my fav part of dining there)! Even when she would stop by to check on us, she would literally be walking by our table and quickly say, ""howsthefoodiseverythinggoodgreat!"". I'm just like, huh? Can you please speak a bit slower and actually STOP at our table to ask if everything is fine?? Another thing that annoyed me was where we got seated. We were seated in a 2-person booth which was adjacent to the kitchen. They had a window on the wall where we could see the kitchen. Some people might like that but I definitely did not. I could just hear pots and pans being banged around and the kitchen staff talking and laughing loudly. So much so that I could barely hear our own conversation. As you can imagine, with a frustrating dining experience like this, I definitely don't think I will go to this Cheesecake Factory location again."
Heather M.,"Torrance, CA",93,38,20,2.0,5/17/2015,"I know this location is busy , it's very beautiful , it's on the water ... I get it . I have had the opportunity to have eaten at this location several times ( about 11 times ) this year , I got great service , loved the wait staff , adored the food and ambience. Since I had such positive experiences with this location in the past I decided to bring my family here to celebrate my moms birthday  What a freaking disaster. We arrived just after 6 with a party of 8 ( I called to make a reservation earlier in the day , and the woman told me they don't take reservations , to just walk in I LATER AFRER ARRIVING WAS TOLD THAT THEY DO TAKE RESERVATIONS BUT INLY WITHIN THE 1st THIRTY MINUTES OF OPENKNG ) they said the wait was an hour 45 minutes :(  It was awful. Then when I went to check to see how much longer ( like an hour into waiting ) a woman with blonde hair was very snotty to me and said it was probably gonna be closer to two hours :/  Whatever we finally got a table at around 1 and half of waiting  Took forever for bread to come , waitress was nice but she took forever to come and take order , and 3 things we ordered were messed up  Ugh :( I dunno i may try to go an enjoy this place again but I'm not sure"
Luis R.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,8,2,5.0,10/30/2015,"This place is great. I love the fact that they're outdoor seating is next to the marina. Outdoors it kinda feels as if you were in a ""mom and pops"" italian restaurant. Which is perfect. Inside however it is amazing (like every other CCF) Service is great here aswell."
