Steven S.,"Gardena, CA",73,76,1107,4.0,10/12/2014,Farfalle with chicken and roasted garlic is definitely a go to;-) also buffalo blast are a great appetizer:-) a huge menu and a bit pricey but well worth it on a special occasion or 2.
P B.,"Redondo Beach, CA",0,4,,3.0,7/17/2016,"Though the food is predictable, we had numerous dirty utensils and a glass. Makes you wonder about the cleanliness of everything behind the scenes."
Valerie L.,"Redondo Beach, CA",91,79,12,2.0,5/22/2015,"We usually go the Cheesecake Factory for special occasions because I think it's a little pricey. We brought our daughter for her 18th birthday and this experience was quite disappointing. They served her steak way under cooked (it was cold); and when replaced, her meal came out after the rest of our party was finished! The manager kindly comped the meal, but then we waited another 20 min for the waiter to return to take our dessert order. We skipped the birthday singing because by that time, the experience wasn't fun anymore. I don't think I'll be returning for awhile. Sorry."
John F.,"Big Bear Lake, CA",112,12,,5.0,12/16/2015,"This place right here... Oh man, what can I say about this place? First off, despite not having much of a selection of beers on tap, they made up for it for having both pint and 22oz sized glasses. Guess which one (or 2...or 5) I had. Anyhoo, I forgot exactly what I ordered, but it was pasta with chicken and bacon in it. Now being Italian, I'm very picky about my pasta and this place did not disappoint. I have yet to eat the slice of cheesecake I brought home, for if I had taken another bite, I would have exploded. I remember the waiter kept bringing French fries that I didn't order but I want complaining because I want paying (gotta love company parties). Oh and I was late to work this morning because of the coma the food put me in. So I suggest coming here if you don't work the next day."
Larry M.,"Torrance, CA",1,32,,5.0,1/11/2016,"What can you say bad about the best cheesecake selections anywhere. All of the food is great, too many to choose from and a good bar and great view."
D M.,"Dallas, TX",1,20,11,1.0,3/30/2014,"This place was packed at 8:45 on on a Sunday! I'm new to the area but wasn't going to give up a free piece of cheesecake so I picked up dinner as well. I'm paying for it now.  I called in the order & I got the Renee special there ate 2 options on this plate - I knew I didn't like how dry the turkey was when I had this during another visit so I ordered the chicken almond salad sandwich. ... but ended up with the turkey. (I KNEW the girl taking my order needed to repeat it back to me but I didn't make her, & the order was wrong) well so turkey @ California ' s CF is dry like in Texas. I wasn't asked what dressing I wanted, and ended up with no plastic-ware to eat my salad, soup and cheesecake with.... I ended up only finishing the soup.  Now I'm sick to my stomach."
Erika L.,"Chelsea, Manhattan, NY",61,34,41,3.0,7/15/2014,"Huge pieces of cheesecake and A LOT of options to chose from, I had a hard time deciding what to get but ended up with the banana cream cheesecake. It was good but nothing I will order again when there is so many other flavors!"
Mary A.,"Sherman Oaks, CA",2,20,,5.0,5/29/2016,"Brandon was great waiter! He was helpful, kind and very attentive. He was very detailed with our order and he remembered when we asked for anything extra.  The food was also on point!  Better than the one in Sherman Oaks where we usually go. All in all - great food, great service, and great view!!!"
Kevin B.,"Midway City, CA",357,309,688,5.0,7/8/2014,"Delicious food, and outstanding service the portions were very nice and the exsprsso was perfect.  Very happy with the whole Cheese Cake Factory"
Michele S.,"Torrance, CA",0,72,26,2.0,5/20/2015,"Arrived here on a Wednesday night around 7pm... Not even crowded yet our waitress came and took our appetizer order without  writing it down on paper... Then she came back to ask what was it again???....No bread ,had to ask another server for it,never refilled our waters.. Took forever to clear our plates.....My husband wanted me to just leave ten percent or less cause of the bad service... I didn't do that.... Sometimes I wish when we are having bad service we are able to switch tables..... Oh well.... Our appetizers were good and meals just the hot wings were burnt and salty.....:("
Susan D.,"Los Angeles, CA",51,116,58,3.0,8/12/2015,So the patio is nice but I think Marina del Rey`s is better.  Lots of boats to look at...timing is key sitting here bcuz of the sun...umbrellas don`t help...waitstaff friendly and let you dine...the regular tea is weak...pretzel crusted chicken  a 10+  but the Asian lettuce wrap tacos a disaster to eat without wearing them....should come with instructions!!  Seriously.  You can't self- park here so prepare for valet charge $4.00.. at 5pm-ish
Ciara G.,"Frenchtown, NJ",187,1212,7583,3.0,1/22/2010,"Everyone knows their menu is huge as well as portions. Prices have gone up but prices have gone up everywhere.  I love their Passion Fruit Iced Tea and would drink a whole pitcher if they would bring me one.  Just went for some apps tonight. We got my favorite Buffalo Blasts which are just little fried pockets of heaven. Wonton wrappers stuffed with Buffalo Chicken and cheese and then fried. Yum! I get these every time and they never fail me.  Other Ap ordered was the Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes. They were not the greatest. I have had them before and remember them being much better. These ones tonight, the cakes themselves could have been cooked a little longer to get a crisper surface. They were topped with an excessive bunch of goop that was way to much for it's own good.  Server was good as service usually is here. We had Jerry tonight and I believe I have had him before and in that same section we were sitting in. Funny.... No cheesecake as I was overloaded from my cupcakes earlier. But they had a new Red Velvet (surprised it took them this long to make one) cheesecake cake which Jerry said was a huge hit. Maybe next time.  At this location they have VERY limited self park spots which sucks. Especially bc valet is $3.50 (basically $5 bc of tip) and the guys working valet do not make any extra effort greeting you or getting your car."
Khalia B.,"West Hollywood, CA",11,185,18,4.0,7/26/2015,"I am a big fan of the Cheesecake Factory. To be truthful, I don't vary my choices on the entrees, just the desserts. I have tried the Snickers Cheesecake, Reese's Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake Cheesecake, Lemoncello Torte and some others that I cannot recall.  Cajun Chicken Jambalaya is the dish. Today, I came for my birthday. A sweet treat!!"
Chris G.,"Rancho Palos Verdes, CA",789,1189,1413,4.0,1/2/2013,"This location is ALWAYS crowded, expect to wait 15-60 minutes if you go during peak hours. My family and I ate in the bar, which usually has no wait.  The service is slower, but you will still get in and out without having to wait.  The bar also has televisions for sport viewing. My recent experience was good, I enjoyed the fish tacos, which includes 4 tacos.  They were tasty (B+).  They also make some good scratch drinks, look at their menu and see what sounds good."
Nicole S.,"Redondo Beach, CA",204,74,7,3.0,8/6/2014,"My hubby and I took our two boys out for a family date night this past Sunday and choose the Cheesecake Factory.  Upon arrival, there was a huge amount of people waiting for tables but I have to say that it was only about a 15 minute wait.  Not bad.  However, the clientele that was there was pretty gross.  Nobody dressed up to go out to eat.  What's wrong with people these days?  It was loud.  People were pushy.  I understand it's not a 5 star restaurant but they are still going out to eat.  Put a little effort into yourself and don't talk so loud that everybody around you can hear you!  A lady kept talking about how tall I was hoping that I would chime in...  Finally, she tugs on my arm and asks how tall I am.  Funny.... My son ordered chicken breast w/ veggies and mashed potatoes off of the kids menu.  Super yummy.  My other son ordered the burrito off of the adults menu.  It was HUGE but also yummy.  I ordered the Kung Pao Shrimp.  It was yummy but not what you'd expect...  but delicious all the same.  Not sure I would order it again as it was a little heavy and I felt like my butt was growing as I took each bite!  lol  My hubby ordered some noodle dish and it SUCKED.  He barely ate any of it.  The waiter asked if everything was okay and I told him that my hubby's dish was not good.  He just did the ""oooooh"" sad face.  The end.  What?!  No trying to make it better or even seem interested.  I would want to know more being that he could at least make a recommendation to the kitchen or future guests...   We all ordered a cheesecake each to take home. You can't go wrong with any choice you make.  I ordered the carrot cake which was very light.  I think this was the least of my favorite as it didn't have much flavor.  No true carrot cake / spice flavor that you would expect.  The fudge cake was amazing!  and the red velvet cake was superb!  the smokes cheese cake was my husband's choice but I didn't try it....   All in all, if you want a good meal but a loud environment...  go here.  The menu is HUGE!!!  They even have an entire ""skinny menu"" to choose from if you are cautious with what goes into your body.   Our bill was $150...  not the cheapest date night but we did order a lot."
Sandra Y.,"Tustin, CA",2,21,1,4.0,6/25/2014,"First time going here, I ordered take-out for dinner. I was very surprised their relatively huge lot was solely for valet! (Was it 4 bucks? I don't remember-check the reviews below me). What a way to make money.  It was very crowded which made me relieved that I didn't dine-in though I suppose it'd be fun with a group of people. It's beautiful at night of course.  I was pleased with the way I was treated there. Very nice.  I'm not a pig ok...but I opened the take-out tray and for $17+ tax, what was in there looked like leftover portion. I think my asparagus may have been on the burnt side, but the food was overall good. It's times like this when I wish I were a millionaire. Delish-"
John J.,"El Segundo, CA",0,5,7,1.0,6/28/2016,"I don't want to spend a lot of time writing this, but I came here tonight and it took over an hr (from the time we were seated at our table to being served our dinner) for the food to come out. It's not like this place was packed, as it was a Monday night. I had my parents with me who are visiting in town and they were dying to dine here. We complained to the manager, Brent, who only paid for my father's meal. I was like, 2 other people have waited over an hr to eat as well, not just 1. I've been coming here for years and this was by far the worst service I've had from a restaurant in years. I advise you to try another restaurant, especially if you're starving and want class A service."
Lauren K.,"Torrance, CA",508,184,94,3.0,8/2/2015,"I love the outdoor patio seating that overlooks the dock, but unfortunately, we didn't make a reservation, so there were no tables available except for the small ones pushed against the walls. The service was friendly and attentive, but the food was underwhelming for the price. I had the Tuna Tataki Salad with big slices of seared Ahi tuna. It was a refreshing dish, but I'm glad I got the dressings on the side because they were pretty oily and heavy, although savory. My mom got the shrimp jambalaya and did not enjoy it very much. I was disappointed at how bland and flavorless it was. She had to sprinkle salt all over it to make it taste more palatable. The only two things we really enjoyed were the free basket of bread and butter and the tuna tartar appetizer, which was delicious and light."
Alex L.,"Redondo Beach, CA",8,46,191,5.0,6/20/2014,"The combos are very good, fried shrimps and avocado egg rolls are amazing, always fresh! Overall the place of one of the best in South Bay, very cozy with great view and outside patio"
Leidy S.,"Los Angeles, CA",8,96,1,4.0,8/29/2015,"Came here for lunch as a farewell to the director of the preschool I work at. The service was good, the waitress kept checking on us to see if we needed a refill on our drinks. Unfortunately one of the people in our party was not happy with her food, but that was her fault. She ordered the wrong food. The manager on duty quickly came out to see if she wanted something else. I ordered the guacamole salad, it's been 2 days and I'm still thinking about it. It was so delicious and filling. As my dessert I ordered the oreo cheesecake, my most favorite dessert there besides their cake. I will definetely be back."
