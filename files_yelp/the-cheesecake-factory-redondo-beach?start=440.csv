Sam S.,"Los Angeles, CA",18,7,3,2.0,10/7/2014,"My friend moved to the Bay Area years ago and she and I come here sometimes twice a week. We always used the valet services since it's always busy, especially on weekends. This Sunday, my friend and I went there and found that the valet service was not there and the parking was overwhelmed with people, all of whom - including us - had to make several turns around the lot to find a parking spot. Ten minutes later, and we still couldn't find a spot; so we went to another parking service and were told that they are full. In the end, we had to street park the car, 400 feet away, and walk. We didn't mind paying $5 to have this service available, and we still don't mind it. It was a really bad experience, and now we think twice before going there."
Andrea S.,"Lawndale, CA",48,12,11,3.0,3/11/2014,"I REALLY want to give this four stars, but I'll explain why I didn't. So I've been a guest at the Cheesecake Factory a number of times over the years with above average service. The food quality is overall pretty good. Deserts are amazing as always. Be prepared to be willing to spend some money as it is more of a high end restaurant.  So I went today for my brothers 22nd birthday. We sat outside, and although it was chilly, the windows block out wind and the heaters do an amazing job. Our server Cid, was a good server. Not too talkative, just did a basic server job. Now I work in the restaurant business and I know 7 steps of service. Food took about 25 minutes which isn't horrible but a little lengthy. I ordered the lemon herb chicken as that was what he recommended. I don't eat bone in skin chicken and I thought the chicken would be breasts, now a full half chicken. I was pretty disappointed but I figured to try it out. The flavor was bland. I had a different server take it back. My meal was comped off, but my appetite was ruined. Another reason why I give this 3 versus 4 stars is because my dad had ordered a cheesecake and I had told the server previously it was my brothers birthday. So I figured they'd bring him out a complimentary sundae like they did a table nearby. But instead our server decided to assume that my dad was ordering the cheesecake as a birthday desert and not to go. I mean I'm sorry, but maybe you should clarify with your guests and communicate I bit better to avoid such mistakes. If I could, it'd be 4 stars. But as of now, it remains at 3!"
Rob F.,"Torrance, CA",0,11,13,5.0,11/27/2015,"Another wonderful meal at the cheesecake factory, was a little disappointed with the factory burrito, but Chris came over and inquired about the burrito i explained my disappointment & he quickly and politely took care of my concern, I appreciate his willingness to take care of the customer...and now I'm leaving AGAIN as a satisfied and regular customer. Thanks you Chris!!"
Robin R.,"Gardena, CA",9,49,226,5.0,3/28/2014,We ordered soooooo much food! But it was all delicious. I have no complaints at all. I always love to eat here. But today for some reason they were on point! Great food and company.
Susan R.,"Redondo Beach, CA",122,222,303,4.0,8/22/2015,"Had a perfect dinner here last night!  We wanted something light, and low carb.  The skinny menu had two delicious choices that we shared, the ahi tartare and the chicken mushroom wraps.  It was perfect!  Restaurant is always loud so I give it four stars instead of five.  Waitress was very attentive, and location is beautiful."
Marlena S.,"Redondo Beach, CA",204,239,27,4.0,12/5/2013,"I'll preface this review by saying that I'm not, in general, a huge fan of chain restaurants, so I am biased against giving any Cheesecake Factory 5 stars as no Cheesecake Factory has ever ""wowed"" me. However, if you are generally a fan of The Cheesecake Factory, then the one in Redondo Beach is a lovely location overlooking the RB Harbor, and on a sunny afternoon, I would try for the coveted patio seating. If you prefer inside, there are rows of booths and tables lining up near the window for the ocean view. I have found the service to be good at all of my visits.  -Valet parking is $4, but there is also metered street parking (coins only). -Cheesecake Factory doesn't take  reservations, and this location can become especially busy on weekend nights.  -There is event space upstairs that is nice for large group events.  Finally, in my most recent visit I tried the asparagus salad with olive oil, pine nuts, sun dried tomatoes and a fried egg on top. It was DELICIOUS!!  I also had the soup of the day, the mushroom soup, and I also really enjoyed it! Overall experience with the Redondo Beach Cheesecake Factory is positive."
Norah R.,"Lawndale, CA",155,503,550,3.0,5/15/2014,"It's corporate but decent for an escape from the So Cal heat.  Vietnamese Spring rolls, simple a beautiful to look at.  The peanut sauce is tasty. Ordered avocado egg rolls in error...meant to order the Tex-Mex egg rolls, much better tasting and the cilantro sour cream is a treat.  Crab dip was good...but I was too full from the rolls (and maybe the 2 Piña Coladas...which by the way were okay, not as good as mine) so I didn't enjoy it as much as I had hoped. Friendly, efficient service...we beat the crowd and the heat. A good, lively place for tasty, but predictable food."
Julia S.,"Rancho Palos Verdes, CA",1,9,1,1.0,9/16/2015,My sister's boyfriend found a worm in his salad. Need I say more? Never eating there again. How do they charge what they do and not wash their food?
Nancy M.,"Redondo Beach, CA",3,40,10,4.0,4/6/2015,Food is really great. But don't do take out because they may not get it right and then you fund out at home as I did and you won't get the delicious bread and butter or utensils.
veronica d.,"Downey, CA",11,184,74,4.0,6/9/2012,"I love the cheesecake factory! I'm not a regular customer and just come here for special occasions/celebrations/etc. I was just here a few weeks ago with my husband, our mothers, & sisters-in-law having a post mother's day lunch - it worked out perfect, we waited no more than 20min and had a delicious lunch on the outside patio. Most of the servers are quick and attentive, if you get the one that's not, there are plenty of others that can help and make sure your waiter is around at all times. I've tried a few appetizers: egg rolls, potstickers, popcorn shrimp, calamari, and macaroni balls. However, they serve delicious bread that's fulfilling just by itself. The servings are a decent size and many times enough to take home. I've tried a few plates but I always go back to my favorite, the CHICKEN & BISCUITS! it's so delicious I'm getting hungry just writing this = ) I definitely recommend trying a cheesecake slice, it goes perfect with the meal, and there are plenty of different selections to choose from. Yeah there is a valet but it's only a couple of bucks compared to other places that charge $5 and up, but you can always park on the street or the small self park lot."
RT S.,"Chicago, IL",8,232,630,4.0,12/25/2012,"Water view, very friendly We ordered shrimp scampi, shrimp Alfredo and shrimp bistro. Not a fanatic for shrimp just coincidence.  Foods were really good and the service accommodating."
Ris A.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,149,34,3.0,7/20/2014,"The food is obviously excellent, anyone who has eaten here is well aware of this. The Godiva cheesecake that I am currently eating in bed is phenomenal and I'm already looking forward to eating my leftovers from my giant portion of the Parmesan crusted chicken Romano.  My boyfriend's steak was cooked to perfection and full of flavor. The waiter that we had was great too, always making sure that my Arnold Palmer was full.  The biggest issue I had was with the cleanliness of the restaurant. Our table was on the back patio. As soon as we sat down I noticed the table had been cleared, but it didn't seem like anyone had wiped it down. There were still remnants of food from the last party who had sat there and my appetizer plate was dirty.  There were also a few ants on the table, which didn't make things seem very appetizing. The restrooms were also not in the best of shape, there was toilet paper scattered about on the floor. I understand how crowded this spot gets and how busy the staff must be, but I feel like cleanliness should be a priority in any food establishment."
Angela R.,"Torrance, CA",190,312,180,4.0,2/11/2012,"This has to be one of my and my boyfriend's favorite places to fine.  It's not too expensive and not too cheap to be like, what are we doing here for a date night? We like to park across the street to pay metered parking because to pay valet to .. stand in front of  parking lot seems obscene to me. I still haven't grasped the idea of why they have valet parking.  Their menu is too damn long but hey, options are always fantastic when dining. It seems that even for our foodie tummy's, we have vowed to stick to our dishes. Every time, I get a glass of wine and a pan seared salmon dish and my boyfriend gets a glass of wine with his chicken belliago.  Their cheesecake is the best and of course, we always opt to take a slice .. or two .. home. I stick the good ol' faithful of original and my boyfriend just tried the tuxedo. I have to say that it was a little reminiscent of strawberry in the chocolate or cherry? But it was yummy.  For the most part, I like that whenever I come here, there isn't that long of a wait. Without a reservation, there's a 20 minute wait but there's always a seat in the bar area."
Freddy M.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,52,49,5.0,9/6/2015,You can never go wrong eating here the food always has quality Standard and if you don't like it they would be more than happy to exchange it or remove it off your bill the staff is polite and the atmosphere is amazing will return.
Kaylyn S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,205,10,4.0,4/20/2016,"We visited here twice in one weekend.  Friday night we ate at the restaurant itself.  It was very loud since there isn't much sound reduction material (fabric, carpet, etc.) in the dining area.  Still, we had a nice view of the harbor and the sunset, even though we weren't right by a window.  The server was nice, polite and efficient.  The busser (middle-age gentleman, brown hair, glasses) is a rock star!  He was quick, attentive and very helpful.  When he couldn't fix our wobbly table he apologized and asked if we wanted to speak with a manager.  We actually ended up being able to fix it ourselves, but appreciated his genuine effort and concern.  We went back Saturday night, which turned out to also be prom night - hence the restaurant was packed with dressed up teenagers.  We decided to get our dinner to go.  The woman at the to go/dessert counter was very professional in taking our order.  The food didn't come out quite as quickly as she estimated, but that is on the kitchen and not her.  All of our food was ready, with the exception of the side dish for one of our entrees.  It took a very long time (~10 minutes) to get it.  By the time we got the side dish and walked across the street to our hotel, the entrees were cold.  Not lukewarm - cold.  The food was likely good when it was hot, but didn't taste very good cold.  Good news is that the cheesecake was super yummy!"
Diana S.,"N HOLLYWOOD, CA",73,248,57,4.0,7/22/2014,In general I love CheeseCake Factory. They always have great food. we came in for a light dinner and dessert.  Small Plates: Kale Salad: this is by far my favorite salad it is really really good Mushroom & Avocado Fries: this is really good and good complement for any side salad Turtle cheesecake: Yummy this is my favorite Love Blueberry Cheesecake: pass way to sweet for me
Karli G.,"Redondo Beach, CA",53,79,273,4.0,12/2/2013,"The menu is HUGE! You can get any thing from pasta, Sandwiches, salads, fish, chicken, steak, Asian cuisine, Mexican food and more! The kid menu is nice and you can choose from fries or fruit.  They have great lunch specials until 5pm and brunch on Sundays.  The martini's are large and delicious.  The bread they bring to the table when you get there is warm and so fresh! There is great harbor views! It can get crowed at times so I like to go for lunch or an early dinner."
Tanjanique H.,"Paramount, CA",0,2,,1.0,5/3/2016,"I have to say this location is terrible. I have been to different locations and was always satisfied with my service and my food. This visit, the food was terrible. The chicken in my lemon couscous was way over cooked.  My waitress went get me some more , but  brought out more over cooked chicken. After sending my plate back twice I gave up on eating and decided to leave."
Just J.,"Long Beach, CA",0,104,7,5.0,8/17/2015,"Normally, I feel stressed and overwhelmed at Cheesecake Factory, but this was a great experience. We headed down to the waterfront to cool down and have dinner.  Being a Monday, we figured it wouldn't be so crowded.  Wait for 3 at 7:30 for first available was 30 minutes.  We ordered stuffed shrooms and 3 drinks in the bar.  Our server, unnamed as they don't wear name tags, was kind and quick.   We were seated inside once our pager went off.  Our server brought us a basket of bread and was quite helpful and knowledgeable about the menu.  I said I was a fairly healthy eater, so she suggested a few items from the skinnylisious menu.  Our food was delivered quite timely and as requested.  We were checked on and served more water as requested, by Nicky.  She offered dessert menus, asked if we had favorites.  We didn't, so she suggested a couple.  Had she not, we would have past on dessert.  We loved the banana cheesecake, it was light and flavorful as she had described.  Only stressful part was that we left the gift card at home."
JhayDee S.,"Las Vegas, NV",12,5,,5.0,8/17/2015,Food was great and service was great too. Very accommodating servers. They have outdoor seating by the beach. Really nice.
