Corla V.,"Long Beach, CA",18,10,25,4.0,2/16/2015,"I actually like this location. It's on the water. I find it odd that the Cheesecake Factory does not take reservations. Get it together please!!! Lunch here is always pretty darn cool because I can't tell the difference between the lunch size and dinner size, both portions are huge as heck. When your waiter comes and asks if you want bread, make sure to ask for all brown bread Lmao!!! They will bring you all brown, I swear!! I mean that's the best bread in the basket anyways, why not get what you want. On your birthday you get a free dessert!! Yep!! Freeeee. The appetizers are of large proportions so, you can actually have that and skip the entrée. Parking really bites the big one! There is a small free parking area to the right as you pull up. The rest in valet. I usually check to see if there are any available free spaces before paying for valet. Shhhh... I've noticed that the bartenders have  heavy hands. When waiting for your table because they don't take reservations, hang out in the heavy handed bar area and tip well!! Bartenders  remember big tippers!! For those crazy vegetarians, Evelyn's Favorite Pasta with extra broccoli and sun dried tomatoes is yummy!!!"
G M.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,408,722,2.0,2/8/2016,"This place is part of a big chain so the food is pretty much the same. This particular location is not very good. The first problem is no parking at all except valet - whom drive a bit aggressively around pedestrians. Then you get into the lobby and its not very nice, low ceilings (unlike other Cheesecake factories). foggy/dirty glass cases with the desserts. a dozen and a  half people standing around, with only seating for about 6 people. Really loud. When you go into the dining room, it looks pretty nice, but the noise level is out of control. This location seems to attract a louder, rougher, and less sophisticated crowd too. It was overall an unpleasant experience."
Nikta Y.,"Redondo Beach, CA",0,8,,5.0,3/24/2015,"You can never go wrong with Cheesecake Factory! Their menu has a lot to offer, but my personal favorite is the Factory Burrito Grande. This dish is bigger than my head and I never manage to finish it but it always hits the spot! Also, you can never go wrong with their Linda's Fudge Cake. I definitely recommend this place."
Stephen K.,"Alexandria, VA",181,378,235,5.0,8/20/2012,This place is dead at lunch hour...guess it's too far away for most of the lunch hour crowd in El Segundo and other cities.  It did start picking up a bit by the time we left.  I don't say that it was dead in a necessarily negative way...it's just really quiet.  Has a great view of the marina and a beautiful patio with flowers and umbrellas.  Who doesn't like eating outside when the weather is beauiful?   The lunch portions are plenty large enough for most people...did not have room for cheesecake... :-/
Lia C.,"Long Beach, CA",28,4,7,5.0,9/5/2015,Me and my fiancé went to this place last night. We always go to Cheesecake Factory. It's our spot but last night was by far the best time. First they had valet parking for only 4 bucks. Second we both tried something different from what we normally eat there and they were both delicious. The fish taco was awesome!!! Best dish I have had there since I've been eating there!!!! Third we ordered the Linda's fudge cake and for the first time it had nuts on it. That was different from other CCF I have been too. Still a great night!!!
JNadene A.,"San Diego, CA",15,160,378,3.0,6/11/2015,"This is a nice Cheesecake Factory, I didn't know this one was 2 stories. Like all the other ones, good food, good service. I love Cheesecake Factory, but I gave 3 stars because the bathroom was leaking gross, didn't appreciate the forced valet one and only option for parking, and this location was super hard to find."
Tatiana A.,"Los Angeles, CA",115,13,12,5.0,7/10/2015,Great customer service from Natalie our server. Always had a smile even if she was passing by. The food was great too we had a party of six and got seated quickly Friday night around 7:30pm
Clifford P.,"Redondo Beach, CA",3,101,,4.0,7/31/2014,"Actually 3.5 stars, but in honor of National Cheesecake Day, I rounded up to 4. Some basics first. They have a very small lot for self parking and take-out (it was completely full when we got there), valet parking is $4. They don't take reservations, so it's best to arrive either very early or very late. Despite being a large restaurant, expect a wait if arriving during prime dinner hours. On our visit, we arrived around 5:30pm and were told we could be seated immediately inside, but there would be a long wait for outside seating. We opted to sit inside. We started with 2 appetizers, Fried Calamari and Crispy Crab Wontons. The calamari was perfectly cooked, nice crispy exterior, and came with garlic dip and cocktail sauce. The wontons were also well prepared and came with a sweet chili sauce. For our entrees, we ordered the Mushroom Burger, Pepperoni Pizza, Chicken Enchiladas, Grilled Coulotte Steak, and Renee's Special which consisted of a 1/2 turkey sandwich, cup of soup du jour, and a small green salad. Everyone seemed to enjoy their entree except for the Chicken Enchiladas. The black beans and cilantro rice were both surprisingly spicy, and the enchiladas themselves were just so-so. The desserts were the highlight of our meal, as should be expected from a restaurant named Cheesecake Factory. We ordered the Dulce de Leche Caramel, Toasted Marshmallow S'mores Galore, Pineapple Upside-Down, and Wild Blueberry White Chocolate cheesecakes. All were equally good in their own right. Each came with a double portion of whipped cream, and each slice could have been easily shared by 2 or 3 people. Needless to say, we ended up taking home quite a few leftovers. Service was courteous and efficient, with our drinks and food arriving promptly after ordering, and soft drinks being refilled as needed. The Cheesecake Factory boasts quite an extensive menu (I lost count after page 15 ...) with seemingly endless choices for appetizers, entrees, and of course, cheesecakes. With so much of their menu left untouched by our group, it just begs for multiple return visits."
Sonja E.,"Gardena, CA",56,22,8,5.0,6/5/2014,"Love this place! Love the bread... Always get the hibachi steak plate! So good! We've been coming here for years... Only problems have been the steaks. My husband ordered a rib eye, and got a piece of meat that was mostly fat. Gave it back. Didn't get charged. Didn't order a replacement. :-\ My kids ate good. Chicken teriyaki, Mac n cheese, chicken fingers... Yummy place! Then we took home cheesecakes! I had the red velvet Cheesecake. Delightful!"
Valentina L.,"Clearwater, Tampa Bay, FL",2530,705,2664,4.0,8/15/2012,"Always a great time, once you plow through the cataloguey menu with 10 plus pages. An extensive menu, the wait staff is generally happy, my last waitress was super sweet and fun. Moderately priced, good food that comes up fairly fast! Good portions, and yum yum. It is trendy and gets busy around sunset, but there is always plenty of room for inside and outside dining! Don't forget my fave: White Chocolate Raspberry Cheesecake, it is...after all...the Cheesecake Factory!"
Rey L.,"El Segundo, CA",120,851,1991,3.0,7/16/2012,"the sun never came out and it was dreary and chilly. maybe that worked its' way into this review.  the food was ok. the spot itself is pretty awesome, next to the water/marina. valet parking only, pretty consistent with other Cheesecakes. staff was cool. sit outside, only if the sun is out... not really much to say about this place other than that. eh."
Vonnie S.,"Los Angeles, CA",97,328,519,3.0,2/17/2012,"Okay; so what can I say about this chain that hasn't already been written? Pro's  - anyone can find something to eat on this menu  - the strawberry martini is TO DIE FOR!!  I wanted another but was driving so had to stick to one (with long, slow sips)  - despite the place being super-packed on a Sat. night, my party of 2 was quickly seated in about 15 minutes  - my server was awesome!  He was super-friendly, attentive and had great product knowledge  - despite most items being horrible calorie bombs, the food is always consistently yummy (miso salmon... drool)  - so many choices in cheesecake, we took ours to go and I enjoyed it over 3 days =)   - great views of the marina Con's  - is there really a reason to have valet parking AND to charge $3.50 for it??  You know those two quarters are going towards the tip!   - the calories in the food are KILLER and it's not a place you can frequent, often   - prices continuously creep on up there.  Paying $18 for a salmon dish isn't the worst but isn't the best All-in-all, this is a good place to head to when you have picky eaters and you when you still want decent portions."
Kirk M.,"Hemet, CA",58,19,9,5.0,11/6/2011,"Cheesecake Factory is always a safe bet when dining out - but the Redondo Beach location may be the very best location in the entire chain. We almost always sit out on the patio (even in oh-so-cold January), as the heaters more than compensate for the cool temperatures. It's just so therapeutic to us to dine and enjoy the view of the Redondo marina just a few feet away. The service is EXCELLENT, particularly Anthony, Kacey, Melinda, Klare, Robert, Sandymar, Sean, Summer, Heather, Mariel, Antoinette and Amber (yes, we've been there a few times). Some of our particular favorites on the menu include the Mexican Tortilla Salad, Sheila's Cashew Chicken Salad, the Kobe Burger (with green salad), the Buffalo Blasts, Onion Rings, Fish & Chips, the Tuscan Salad, and the Huevos Rancheros. And of course, the cheesecake rocks - Vanilla Bean is one of our favorites, but the pumpkin cheesecake in October and November is a definite treat. The Key Lime/Mango cheesecake is like having a bite of a summer day. I have it on good authority from my wife that the Pomegranate Margarita is da bomb, too (I don't drink, so I have to take her word for it). You can park on the street for $1/hour (bring quarters), but you're going to be there at least two hours, and Redondo PD is very aggressive with ticketing. The valet parking for $4.00 is worth not having to hassle with the street parking and the parking enforcement. All in all, one of the nicest places to dine sea-side in the South Bay."
Shayna A.,"Long Beach, CA",13,10,3,5.0,6/13/2015,Happy hour!!! Love this place. My waiter Adrian was awesome. He even got down on one knee to take my order.. Didn't think I could get a guy to get on one knee for me but I did! I'll be back for sure.
Katie G.,"Colorado Springs, CO",0,8,6,1.0,1/1/2016,"We recently ate at the Redondo beach Cheesecake Factory, 2 hours ago. While the service and majority of food were good, the 1 star rating is because our appetizer came with more than we asked for, bites taken out of not one but two pieces of the avocado egg-rolls! We were served a plate of avocado egg-rolls and right before any of us touched the plate, we noticed two egg-rolls were about half the size of the rest. Upon further inspection we noticed teeth marks in the egg-rolls  along with a crescent shaped bite mark. We couldn't believe what we saw and so told the waitress someone had obviously taken a bite. She agreed and apologized and said she would inform the manager who we never saw. We at least expected to be comped the egg-rolls which didn't happen (they brought us a second plate, bite mark free which we paid for) but we're really disappointed we didn't even have our issue addressed with management. For us, that was rather unprofessional given the situation. Won't be coming back and recommend you inspect your food before diving in."
Angela A.,"Torrance, CA",2170,124,3649,1.0,5/27/2013,"Let me just say that I'm a big fan of Cheesecake, but definitely not this location!!!  Will I spend another dime at this location? OVER MY DEAD BODY!  I've always gotten very good service at other Cheesecake so I was very surprised when I was stuck with a RUDE, inattentive waitress! Oh she was just awful! So far I've read other Yelper's unpleasant experience is because they thought the server thought they were young and would not tip well? Hello?? How judgmental is that? Sometimes it's the elderly that doesn't tip well! If the service is good, I will tip you well!  It was not that busy that night and it literally...I mean literally took 20 mins to have anyone come to our table to ask for beverages or any sorts of greeting. And took another 10-15 mins for the waitress to come over to take our order. Let me just say that our waitress did NOT apologize for making us wait so long and just took our order. Shortly after that, she stumbled to the table next to ours and apologizing to them about slow service. OH I know she knew we were listening to her apologizing. ummm WOW, they have their drinks, appetizers and gets treated like a royalty... Oh yah, I forgot, they were older than us. Now it all make sense.  I was just sitting there in disappointment because it was my friend's birthday and I can't believe we're getting such awful service and feeling neglected. I felt so bad.....When I got my dish, it was not the same as other Cheesecake locations! It was sooo bland! omg...unbelievable! But my friend's plate was good so that was a relief. As much as I wanted to tip her a penny, I didn't....I was once a server too so I know it would be hurtful if someone tipped me a penny(Not that anyone did. =P~) I still tipped but of course very, very.....very  little. Yah yah, the view was suppose to be nice but whatever! You can go to other location and have better service. Poor service can ruin your mood. Oh another thing I found out is that you are NOT required to valet park, but when we were there, they MADE us valet park, so I don't know what's going on there. The valet park didn't bother me much."
Shaneel R.,"Elk Grove, CA",4,497,650,5.0,5/24/2012,We had a great time here with excellent service from Derek. Beautifully placed in the Marina.
Jen E.,"Los Angeles, CA",212,168,1660,4.0,4/3/2014,"I think this is one of my favorite cheesecke factory locations!The view and the ambiance is so much better than the CFs in inner cities. It's more intimate and romantic. The service was excellent even though the place was full! I ordered the crab cake for the appetizer, the hibachi steak and their mac n cheese for main dish and cheesecake for dessert. They were all good but the winner for me is the hibachi steak because it was cooked to its medium rare perfection. So tender and delicious. The lost star is for the valet.I do not mind paying for valet parking as long as it shows it would really be an inconvenience not to/ certainly preferable to. It was a few steps. I did not see the point."
Tovah G.,"Hawthorne, CA",71,60,10,4.0,2/19/2014,"Always will keep coming back. We ate dinner over the harbor and the meal was perfect. I had the fettucine Alfredo and my husband the Steak Diane, plus the avocado rolls for an appetizer with of course, Cheesecake for dessert.  Needless to say we had lunch for the next day also, but everything was superb and perfectly romantic."
Sarine G.,"Glendale, CA",55,90,9,1.0,10/3/2014,"So... I manage a restaurant a restaurant and I usually don't write reviews unless they are good and positive ones. ..however in this case I really had to put my story out there.   I went to dine in a few nights ago with my husband.  We wanted to self park so the valet told us where to park. Our dine in experience on its own was horrible. By the time our food got to us it was cold... Anyways we paid and went home...when we got home I noticed a dent on my passenger side door. I called cheesecake and spoke to Jen. If my night couldn't get any worse just speaking to her it did. She was unapologetic and just seemed like my call was annoying her. Basically her response was ""sorry we don't have cameras there so we don't have any proof"". WHAT????????? ARE YOU SERIOUS. ok no worries I figured I'll call the next day and speak to another manager...called Thursday night and spoke to Aurella. Oh God. ""My heart goes out to you but I can't do anything about it"". If someone had called my restaurant and had the same issue, I would've at least offered a gift certificate or something...just to not lose their business. cheesecake factory you guys are horrible. Please hire a staff that can actually speak English and express themselves in a more professional way because Aurellas heart isn't going to fix my dent. Shame on you for not being able to fix a bad situation,  but kudos for making it worse. The one star was forced by yelp. Oh btw clean up your restaurant...your bathroom was filty."
