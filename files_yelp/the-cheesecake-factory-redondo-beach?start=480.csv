John M.,"Palos Verdes Peninsula, CA",0,24,5,5.0,8/13/2015,"With family or for business, The Cheesecake Factory in Redondo Beach is always good, every time."
Kimberly F.,"Long Beach, CA",0,20,4,5.0,2/23/2014,I absolutely LOVE this place! I'm a regular here and the service is exceptionally superb. Tonight however was over the top. My 7 year old mentioned to Kenzo that he was really hungry and Kenzo brought his food out first with the appetizers. I thought that was amazing. Thanks CCF and thank you so much Kenzo!!!!
Sam S.,"Manhattan Beach, CA",0,51,10,3.0,6/11/2015,"Went yesterday for lunch with wife and daughter.  We've been there several times and waited for outdoor seating.  It was cool and rainy so decided to opt  for inside seating.  That was a mistake.  I find the room noise level unacceptable.  Everyone was almost yelling in order to be heard.  The acoustics are just terrible.  With that said, the food was just ok.  Also service was a little slow but not bad considering how crowded it was.  All in all, it's a nice place, great views of the marina.  If you don't care for lots people and high noise levels you'd be better going elsewhere if there's no out door seating."
Lidia P.,"San Pedro, Los Angeles, CA",9,32,11,4.0,5/2/2014,"If your a sucker for cheesecake, like me, then this is the place for you! They have great variety and have pretty decent portion single slices of cheesecake. Their lunch specials are great deals! There's is a little of everything and the portions were bigger than other lunch specials in other restaurants. Service was nice and friendly and food was amazing! A lil expensive but so worth it! However, they have limited free parking so you might be stuck paying 2.50 for valet parking. Otherwise, I highly recommend it!"
Zach J.,"Torrance, Los Angeles, CA",0,8,,4.0,8/5/2015,"The Cheesecake Factory. Absolutely incredible. From the appetizers , to the entrees, to the exquisite cheesecake, and not to mention the amazing service, this place is great!  I am a vegetarian and on there menu, they have a great Veggie Burger with wonderful flavors and ingredients that give the burger great taste on top of a melted cheese and bun. And not to mention the variety of wonderful cheesecakes. Someone joining me got a wonderful cheesecake with chocolate, peanuts, caramel, and on top with some whipping cream. The service was excellent. They treat us like gold and it was a wonderful experience going to the well known Cheesecake Factory."
Phil B.,"Glendale, CA",66,182,28,4.0,4/28/2014,I give the location 5 stars by far the best location of TCF I've seen. Food : I had the Veggie Burger with Sweet potato fries the Veggie Burger was messy and smooshy since the patty was made from Quinoa the flavor was also bland I'd like to see more of an effort for the vegetarians.  The service was good our server was friendly - I would come back just not order the same thing.
Dani V.,"Torrance, CA",4,2,,1.0,2/14/2015,"I honestly wish negative stars were an option. The most unprofessional establishment I've ever encountered. For Valentine's Day, my husband and I decided to order food to go. Called in our order, gave the worker our phone number (as requested), and told us it would be ready in 25 minutes.  Parking took forever, but it was Valentine's Day at dinner, so I can't be upset about that. We finally got in, paid for our food, and when we were presented with the food, they told us one of the dinners we had ordered is not available at their location yet (though it is advertised) and they were out of the appetizer we ordered. They charged us for both.  My question... It's obviously Valentine's Day. I'm obviously ordering food for two. What kind of an idiot wouldn't think to call the customer and let them know half of their order isn't available?  We told them to forget the entire order. About fifteen minutes later, they refunded the one dinner item only. No... We don't want ANY of it.  Finally, after the second time asking for a manager, we speak with one. She refunded our entire order and told us the money wouldn't show up in our account until the next day or so. She did not offer us any sort of incentive or apology. Unfortunately, I didn't catch her name, but she was rude and sarcastic when saying ""happy Valentine's Day! Have a great night!"" Thank you, Cheesecake Factory, for ruining out first Valentine's dinner as a married couple. Not only did we wait OVER FORTY MINUTES for a refund, we didn't even get a meal.  I will never visit this location again. I am truly disgusted with disappointment."
Jenny C.,"Lawndale, CA",88,100,85,3.0,11/21/2013,"Service was slow, i didn't think it was extremely busy, but food was good otherwise. One waitress stopped by to drop off our Portabella Mushroom, Avocado, and Zucchini Fries, but did not pick up our empty plates of what was the Grilled Artichoke--i thought that was weird. Another waitress dropped off two plates since we were sharing, one happens to be dirty. I had to ask for another clean plate. Sanitation is questionable.  Portabella Mushroom, Avocado, and Zucchini Fries were awesome. I would order it again. It was crispy and well-balanced. The veggies were not overpowered by batter. Grilled Artichoke was good, but nothing special. i probably wouldn't order this again. Lemon Herb Chicken; the chicken was slightly dry, but the lemon herb flavor was good. Carrots were cooked perfectly, not too soggy or too crunchy. Mashed potatoes were tasty as always."
Lisa M.,"Redondo Beach, CA",1079,909,1293,1.0,6/6/2011,"Came here with a group of 7 to celebrate a friend's birthday, and they buzzed us to tell us our table was ready. We trot in... oops, they buzzed us incorrectly. Gave us a new one. 5 minutes later, we get buzzed, so we trot back in. The lady tells us to stand off to the side and someone will seat us. So we wait. And wait. People who were getting buzzed AFTER us came and left as they were seated. Lots of people. We wait some more.. then when we see them seat another party of 7 before us, we get legitimately pissed off and inquire at the front. It's pretty obvious the hostess lost our name because she keeps scrolling through her screen. After saying that she can't find us, some guy comes by and actually insinuates that it was OUR fault we weren't seated right away because we ""weren't waiting in the correct spot where they told us to."" UHHHH seriously?? I can only assume this guy was some assistant manager, but the restaurant should send him to some customer service classes because he didn't apologize once after realizing that they sat the wrong group and gave away our table. NO APOLOGY. A simple apology would have sufficed, but I guess he's not the bigger person here. So we finally get seated after waiting in the area for 20 minutes (this is AFTER we were buzzed, mind you), and got offered no complimentary appetizers or drinks or desserts or anything to make up for their mistake. Oooook, whatever. We order our food, devour our bread and drinks... what a surprise, our waiter sucked too!! We had to flag him down to get refills, they forgot our friend's beer, and he disappeared when it was time for the check to come. Imagine our anger after learning there's a mandatory tip added to parties of 6 or more. I understand it's pretty much rule to add on gratuity to large parties, but should we still have to pay it when we had the worst service ever? I thinks not, but instead of arguing or making a scene, we decided to swallow our frustration and just pay the bill. Course, it's another 15 minutes before we can get our waiter to come and take the check... he actually ended up NEVER coming to get it, so at this point we just wanted to get the hell out of there. We were about to take the check up to the front when our waiter caught us right before. We're standing around like idiots waiting for this guy to swipe our cards, when the non-helpful assistant manager from before strolls by. I'm guessing he saw our pissed-off faces because he actually bothered to ask if we had a problem this time. Food is consistently decent here, but with their overpriced dishes and pretty horrific service, we all decidedly stated that we're never coming back here again. We were extremely disappointed, not to mention it put a damper on my friend's birthday celebration. So thanks for nothing, cheesecake!!!"
Tonja B.,"Inglewood, CA",2,11,19,1.0,10/11/2015,I'm pissed at the cook the food was horrible.. The biggest onions that I have ever seen was in my food.. The manager Jennifer was high and I couldn't understand anything that she was saying she smelled like a 24 pack of beer. The server Adrian was great he needs to work at the Cheesecake Factory in Orange County he's to good of a server to work at this location better yet he needs to be the manager.. Please don't go to this location the food is dog food and jail house food better yet I wouldn't even feed my dog this food. I am PISSED.. I hope they fire the cook and drug test Jennifer she is literally on crack..
Nick D.,"Torrance, CA",90,263,219,2.0,6/19/2011,"Food is alright.  I have experienced better.  Its way too nosiy inside the restaurant.  Too big of a menu.  Like Gordon Ramsey might say if it was one of those restaurants on Kitchen Nightmare, keep it simple.  I got to say putting the restaurant next to King Harbor was ok.  Oh and I hate cheesecake. Oh and I hate how Cheesecake Factory has valet parking.   Even if i was driving a hot European sports car or a Chevy Corvette Z06 or to that matter an F150 supercrew 4x4 lifted, they will never touch it I would rather self park it thank you very much and save a few dollars for the overpriced lunch or dinner.  If I knew then that I knew now, I would of just told them I'm going to self park it. If you don't want to spend that much at the cheesecake factory, head to Hermosa Beach and goto Mickie's Deli for some meatball sandwiches and use that extra money for something else."
Gary S.,"Frederick, MD",0,22,,5.0,6/17/2015,Was not sure about a chain restaurant. But this place was great. Ended up eating there two nights In a row. Good food great service
Jorge P.,"Torrance, CA",83,53,24,4.0,3/9/2014,"You come to the Factory for above average settings, above average food and great ambiance. I will admit the food sometimes looks better than it tastes but not often.  The lunch specials, especially the fresh grilled salmon, are great deals.  The valet is excessive at $4 plus tip.  But you can't beat the location and the experience. I will always come back"
Carol S. R.,"Trabuco, CA",8,18,,1.0,11/20/2014,"Attended my nephew's wedding there. Abby, the catering manager told my sister that it was okay to leave their personal stuff and she would store it in her office for next day pickup. My sister picked the stuff up and a lot of stuff was not returned!!!! The a/c was lacking in the room. She told my sister not to worry her stuff would be safe in her office. In the long run...many items came up missing!!! Don't be a victim of theft from the Cheesecake Factory!!!"
Terry A.,"Los Angeles, CA",453,271,312,4.0,3/1/2014,"We had lunch today at around 2:30-3. For a Saturday it was crowded I'm sure it's a usual for them and being located off the pier which include beautiful beach views.  I've been here during the week at various times in the past and I always receive excellent service and delicious food. Today we valet for $4 which I don't mind the option but would like more self parking. We didn't have reservations and wait more then 20min. The front host was great she listen to our request of Window seating. Our table host I think was a little talkative with her colleagues and took us long to get to our table. Our waitress pleasant and friendly. Our drink oder come out fast but our food took 25-30min. Remember to oder bread it's tasteful and it kills time!  Food we oder off the Factory Combinations: 1.steak diane medium well, Scamp shrimp with smash potato $19.95 2. Steak Diane medium well, salmon and smash potato$ 19.95 everything was flavorful and cook to perfection.   Desert we had the Chocolate Tuxedo Cream that was ok! I would give them 5 five stars but I think they need more servers ********Thanks busboys you guys are the best*****"
Jessica C.,"El Segundo, Los Angeles, CA",15,2,,2.0,11/8/2014,I was very disappointed in coming to the factory. The food was good but the service was terrible. What really made me mad was that the hostess took my name down and told us it was a 20 min wait. 30 min passed so I went to check to ask and found out that we weren't even listed. The buzzer she gave me wasn't even activated.
Fawn G.,"San Antonio, TX",176,550,777,3.0,9/9/2013,"Not a big fan of forced valet parking, but I am a fan of open bar seats and being the only ones who know to sit there on a busy Saturday night. They have full service there too my friends!"
Serg M.,"Torrance, CA",65,76,15,4.0,7/3/2013,"Usually my reviews focus on the food and customer service. This review will specifically focus on the service. Food was excellent. not going to lie. Its so good that I have been back once since then. Our waitress did a job, on a scale of 1 to 10; an 8. She was tired and overworked (been on shift nearly 12 hrs). When we got the bill, we specifically instructed her to split the bill in half charge the $24 tip on my friends card since the other person was their guest. Anyway, a few days later...I called the bank to inform them I lost my ATM card and if there were any charges in the last few days. The only charge was Cheesecake Factory at 64 dollars. It should have been 40 for the meal. The server ended up charging both me and my friend 24 dollars each. That's $48 for a $80 meal. That's b.s. No way we are paying more than 50% for tip. I called the restaurant and spoke to the manager, Robert Ghyczy. I explained to him the situation and said he would investigate. He kept calling every 20-30 minutes for about 2 hrs keeping me updated, which I truly appreciate. He found the mistake and offered to return the money on the card which would have taken up to 6 weeks (stupid merchant policy IMO on their bank) or take a gift card which would only take 3-5 business days to arrive at my house. I choose the gift card. Props go out to the manager for taking care of this in a very timely and professional manner, I have used the card and the food and service rocked."
Maui D.,"Culver City, CA",1,26,,4.0,11/26/2013,Fun happy hour and good views. Food is better then average. They have large portion sizes and the drinks rock. It's all about the drinks at HAPPY HOUR.  Also try the calamari. It's the best here with the homey mustard.
Ben P.,"Los Angeles County, CA",1,36,9,3.0,8/6/2013,The setting was very nice and the place is big so getting in isn't a huge issue. The food was very good as you would expect. The service was a little on the edgy side and very slow.  Allocate a long time for dinner if you go here. The parking is a little strange.  They hit you up for valet ($4 + tip) which seems a little silly considering the parking lot is huge and right next to the entrance.
