. ..,"Hermosa Beach, CA",4998,903,1604,2.0,8/3/2014,"My friend and I attended a late lunch / early dinner last night here at the Cheesecake Factory. We had a party of 9 and upon placing our name on the waiting list we waited about 20+ minutes for a table which seemed like a long wait because at the time we arrived the CCF was not all that busy.  Upon being seated we had a short wait for our server to show up which was fine because it gave members of our party time to talk. A server finally arrived and took our drink order. From the time our drink orders were placed until the time they arrived on the table was a good 10 minutes. I ordered water with lime; my drink was served in a plastic mug with melted ice and no straw, not that big of a deal but you expect a higher level of service at the CCF.  I took a look at the menu and had forgotten how many things are on the menu. My mother used to tell me never trust a restaurant with lots of items on the menu which is a good point, how do these restaurants keep all of these items fresh? The simple answer is they usually cannot. With this is mind I went with a simple order. I ordered a chicken club with avocado on toasted wheat bread with no mayonnaise & no cheese. I also asked for the chicken on the sandwich to be grilled / cooked until it was black / burnt. I had the choice of having French fries or a green salad as a side; I decided to go with the green salad.  The other members of our party ordered rice, to herb roasted chicken, to soup, to salads & burgers. The wait for the food to come out again took quite some time. When the food finally arrived at the table it was subpar at best. The wheat bread I had asked for was now soggy white bread which was barely even toasted, the green side salad I had ordered was wilted and when I finally picked up my sandwich it literally fell apart in my hand. I ended up taking the sandwich apart and eating the rest of it with a fork. When I took the sandwich apart I observed the chicken to have no grill marks, it was not blackened and it was not even close as ordered. I ate maybe half of the sandwich and decided to not test out the wilted greens that looked like they had not seen the inside of a refrigerator in quite sometime. During the course of our meal which lasted almost 2 hours I was never once asked if I wanted more water which I finished quickly while trying to wash down my meal.  My friend ordered the herb roasted chicken which she only finished 1/3 of. I will have to say that I had a bite of the mashed potatoes that came with her meal and they were good but not great. The mashed potatoes were lumpy with the potato skins blended in which is just the way I like them.  I was severely disappointed with the quality of my food. The Chef's in the kitchen should also be disappointed in the quality of food they are allowing to leave their kitchen. I love to cook and I know I would of never of served a guest of mine let alone a paying customer a soggy sandwich that is unable to even be held without self-destructing.  I looked around the table and every member of our party had a large majority of their food left over. They were either not all that hungry or like me they found the food to subpar.  We had all spoken about ordering dessert before our food arrived but at the end of our meal everyone decided against it.  There is little to no chance that I visit this location again. The last time I visited the CCF was the location in Marina Del Rey many years ago and I had a very similar experience in regards to the quality of food. In my personal opinion the CCF should focus on reducing their menu to ensure everything that is coming out of the kitchen meets the standards of the prices on the menu and the décor.  There is no self-parking available at the CCF, it is all valet until I believe dinner hours. When dinner hours arrive you are still required to pay a nominal fee to park your vehicle. I refuse to leave my vehicle with a valet and luckily being a surfer who surfs in the general area I knew exactly where to park for free on the street and that is exactly what I did.  I still had an enjoyable time. Our party had a good conversation and good laughs but if I called the food poor that would be giving it an upgrade. As stated above the Chef's working in this kitchen should be embarrassed when a fast food restaurant is putting out better quality food then they are!!!"
Vivian A.,"Arvada, CO",858,880,1831,3.0,1/3/2012,"Very pretty location right on the water. The location itself is visually great. The waitress kept forgetting our requests. Maybe you should right it down, Honey? What I swallowed: PASSION FRUIT MOJITO: SUPER SWEET but bursting with minty flavor. If it wasn't so sweet it would actually be really good. AHI TUNA SALAD: The tuna was fresh and the tomatoes were hearty. The avocado was a bit mushy and on the brown side.  On our way home, we all noticed we had a 'funny' taste in our mouths. What was it? Some weird, lingering after taste? I thought it was me 'cuz I had fish but all three of us had it (one friend had fish and chips and the other had a chicken dish) so that's a bit concerning. Four stars for the location/ambiance. Three stars for the food and service. Two stars for the weird after taste feeling we all experienced. $3.50 for valet parking. There was parking located right on the street so if you see some, park there."
Jesse P.,"Burlingame, CA",39,84,103,2.0,2/11/2013,"I was here for a wedding in their upstairs private rooms. The atmosphere was warm and the food is what you expect any chain restaurant to be, average.  This place forces you to valet part - no self parking permitted.  Normally this isn't necessarily a bad thing, especially at $4. But they returned my father-in-law's car with a nice dent in the front quarter panel. He also happened to be the father of the bride for the wedding. All the staff acted as though they were not responsible and no one came forward to admit the damage. Very frustrating to deal with considering the damage was not there before entering their property. He was forced to return the next day to fill out a form and speak to a different manager and they still refused to acknowledge their error."
Pouya J.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,7,,4.0,12/2/2013,Cheesecake Factory's food quality varies based on location in my experience. This location is one of the better ones. And I think the portions are bigger here too. Or maybe I was hungrier when I went to the other locations. As always you get plenty of calories per meal and a healthy part of that is coming from carbs and oil. So there's that.  The one thing you only get at this location is the view. Try to get a table on the balcony and sit there looking out on the boat dock. It's quite beautiful. Also try the Arnold Palmer.
Lisa U.,"Denver, CO",311,220,219,2.0,4/25/2013,"OK- don't get me wrong, I love cheesecake factory.  For a chain restaurant they have delicious food; however, THIS specific cheesecake factory is not my favorite.   First off, it's not very convenient- you have to valet to get in.  I like the CF locations in OC that are in a mall.  Second, the service is not very good.  The servers get annoyed when you ask for more bread, and it always seems understaffed. For some reason, this cheesecake factory is my least favorite.  I've been to many different locations, but this one is just different....  Unfortunately, it's the closest one to my house, so I wil just have to deal."
Rick H.,"Lawndale, CA",48,86,69,5.0,3/3/2014,"The service is always fantastic, the food delicious and they've added a low calorie section to the menu great vegetable salad with all the flavor.  I would recommend an ATM inside due to valet only taking cash it is an inconvenience to walk across the street to crowne plaza hotel to take out a $20 or just take cards at valet. Lastly have a glass of there carefully selected wine the Pinot Noir was great. Thanks cheese cake team for the service. Thanks especially to our server (the young lady with the thick black frame glasses serving the bar area on sunday nights)"
Karoll C.,"Paramount, CA",0,2,,1.0,12/8/2015,"The worst experience in dinning of my life 12/6  I cannot believe the service i received,if I was a Heath inspector I would of shut that place down. From dirty  forks to dirty drinking cups. My water cup was disgusting. Good thing I looked at it before I took a sip. There was brown gunk all around my glass. But the worst part was the server. Did they just hire these unprofessional servers. My server kept calling me baby and sweetie and sweat heart in front of my bf the whole night until he was fed up he spoke to him about it and the server ran to the mgr to say he threatened him??? Are you kidding!! Who does that, and the management believed the server, what ever happened to the customers always right or at least the minimum,treat the customer with respect. Well, never ever going there again in my life even if the food was free!!!"
Jeanette I.,"Torrance, CA",82,84,39,3.0,9/29/2013,"My favorite of all the Cheesecake Factory's. Love the patio overlooking the boat dock! On a sunny weekend, grab your shades, a seat outside, order a drink and take it all in. Relax.  Food is standard across all Cheesecakes. Staff is decent.  No one has wow'd me yet, but that's okay. I would still go back. For that patio. Overlooking the boats. And my fruity tropical drink. Maybe a mimosa. And a slice of cheesecake of course."
Vanessa B.,"Los Angeles, CA",20,75,1,4.0,2/27/2015,"Love going here for their cheesecakes of course. My favorite is the white chocolate raspberry truffle. For food my fave is the Spicy Cashew Chicken! Avocado egg rolls, tex mex eggrolls, four cheese pasta, shrimp with angel hair are all yummy. Kids love their mac and cheese."
Hiten D.,"San Jose, CA",12,20,65,5.0,2/3/2015,Easy and free parking. Quick service with a friendly staff. Great food. Had brunch in the patio with a pretty amazing view on a warm summer afternoon.
Tony S.,"Rancho Palos Verdes, CA",73,42,18,3.0,3/11/2015,When you can't agree with your significant other on what to eat and you realize that most other kitchens have already closed but you're too pretentious to eat fast food. Or if you want to crash a 19 year olds birthday party. Cut my food into pieces Cheesecake Factory is my last resort.
Diamond R.,"Torrance, CA",5,43,20,5.0,6/30/2014,"My husband and I was just here last night and service from the bar was 5 stars.  Marcio is a very attentive waiter, great job!"
Heather S.,"Los Angeles, CA",57,134,56,3.0,8/25/2013,"It's the Cheesecake Factory. We all know about their hugely extensive menu already. For both food and cheesecakes. But the strawberry shortcake is what you need to try. It's a shortbread biscuit with sugar crystals baked on top. They cut it in half and stuff it with vanilla ice cream. Then they pour sliced strawberries over it and top it off with whipped cream. That dessert alone gets 5 stars! I gave this location 3 stars because of it's parking. There's only a handful of self parking spots so you're pretty much forced to valet. These valet guys don't really hustle to get your car. Maybe it's just me and my expectations of valet attendants. But most attendants kind of hustle to get my car and I was watching these guys just kinda leisurely walk to get the cars. Not a big deal though I guess. Anyway, get the strawberry shortcake and enjoy!"
Vince B.,"Lomita, CA",3,30,9,5.0,4/27/2015,"My first time to The Cheesecake Factory, and what an experience it was. Ate here on my birthday and was amazed at how delicious the food was. You will be treated with class as they take your food away and box it for you once your meal is complete. They have valet service as well. You will be treated wonderfully from the entrance to the parking lot to the end of your meal. Amazing, wonderful place."
Rebecca R.,"Murrieta, CA",36,8,5,3.0,9/24/2014,"Went here for dinner with my husband on a Saturday night. The appetizers and cheesecake were delish.  The chicken bellagio was not so good and the ribeye steak was awful. Had to send it back once and it arrived again still not cooked right. It was also way too salty also. This place is good for appetizers, cheesecake and drinks only."
Grant G.,"Carson, CA",0,4,,1.0,4/24/2015,"I really did not like how you have to pay for parking, looked around the area and impossible to find parking ! Also my sisters and i ordered pasta and the noodles were all hard. I felt like throwing up after. I was looking forward to getting a cheesecake but my stomach just could not handle it from the food. Will probably never come here again."
Joan H.,"Long Beach, CA",78,7,3,4.0,2/4/2015,"Best Cheesecake Factory in the area! Valet parking only. It was busy when I went but it wasn't that bad of a wait esp when my boyfriend &i got seated out the patio with a really nice romantic view. It was awesome. Food is great, even though they got my man's steak order wrong, our server was genuinely apologetic and totally made up for it! Lastly, tiramisu cheesecake my fave!!"
Katie W.,"Torrance, CA",58,123,34,4.0,12/29/2014,"I have always enjoyed coming to this particular Cheesecake Factory. Lots of parking (although it does get crowded), and a great place to go with a group of friends! They have super yummy cocktails and menu items."
Humberto M.,"Lawndale, CA",25,51,,2.0,2/16/2015,A shadow of its former self.  My wife and I visitied today; she had the salmon and I Leanne's Special. I guess Leanne left long ago.  Flavorless from chicken sandwich to cream of corn.  The waitress was moodier than the Moody Blues.  I guess the old chef retired.
