Kristy C.,"Las Vegas, NV",11,18,3,1.0,2/15/2015,Horrible experience. Kept their air running even though 7 tables complained . So freezing we left with out finishing dinner. Took it to go. Didn't buy cheesecake we just wanted out of there. Pasta Alfredo was terrible didn't finish it . $100 bill and was not enjoyable. So sad wasted $$
Guy G.,"Honolulu, HI",0,88,7,2.0,4/28/2015,Excellent food but waiters used to be more upbeat and cheerful also most parking is assigned for valet parking and the non valet parking area is very limited.
Heather L.,"Redondo Beach, CA",0,2,,5.0,4/28/2015,"This is my second review. My family, knowing nothing about my previous experience 5 days prior but knowing very well about my love for cheesecake, made reservations for a birthday lunch for me here. Without revealing my sources, I can tell you that I am aware that management knew I was coming. Nonetheless, you did an excellent job of trying to make up for your mistakes. We had a party of 8. We were given the best waiter in the house. Being distracted by the festivities, I did not take note of his name, a lovely gentleman who was very attentive and even anticipated our needs. He was very patient with the 3 young children (and the adults!) when we placed our order. Everything was served promptly. My soda glass was refilled before I even knew it was empty! The food was, as usual, good quality. The best part of the whole meal was the dessert, of course. When they brought my cheesecake out and sang happy birthday, the plate they brought it on had ""Happy Birthday Heather"" written in chocolate with colorful sprinkles scattered around. It was better than any restaurant birthday dessert I have seen! Thank you, Cheesecake Factory management, wait and kitchen staff for taking good care of me on my birthday.  My hope is that this serves as a learning experience. At my initial visit, the lack of attention to my needs as a customer was pervasive, being essentially ignored by multiple staff members. At my second visit it was exactly the opposite. I will be back, by myself sitting in the dining room as before, at sometime in the future. Hopefully, you will continue the positive standard you put forth on 4/25. If not, you will hear about it."
Scott S.,"Arlington, VA",1,3,,4.0,3/10/2015,"I very much enjoyed this restaurant.  The food was marvelous as well as the service.  Busy of course, but not a long wait.  The heated patio was great!  Sitting on the patio allows for a nice view of the ocean.  Can be very romantic if on a date.  Inside, it can be noisy and sometimes hard to hear during peak hours.  Overall, it was a great restaurant."
Marissa G.,"Redondo Beach, CA",307,567,134,5.0,3/17/2011,"Cheesecake Factory, the way I think it was meant to be! I've never had anything less than stellar service at this location. Maybe it's the neighboring yacht club and the nice view of the harbor. Maybe it's just great management. But the servers are very attentive and the food always comes out perfectly. I've had my birthday luncheon here twice and we joined them for Fathers' Day brunch. Both were fantastic! This location feels much more upscale and less like a chain than the Arcadia location we frequent. The layout is different and the ocean view makes it seem intimate. I love it!"
B J.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,46,11,2.0,7/13/2014,Wellllll  I'll start by saying I love the Cheesecake Factory but today service sucked the server sucked my salad sucked lettuce wasn't washed I could taste the dirt or whatever was on it.  When I told the server who never greeted us or told us her name she never apologized jus said did I want another salad.   Dark haired 5-7 seemed stressed while working I don't want to accuse her of being on drugs but it wasn't her best day.  We had to keep asking for her to come to our table through another server. This was on the back patio.  Strawberry daiquiri was cool skinilicious turkey avocado delicious.   Ohh and the service sucked
Melvin M.,"Torrance, CA",41,23,14,1.0,12/22/2014,"Food is great but service is terrible.  First time at this location and was surprised how slow the service is.  Took about 15 min to get our drink order and our server could not be found for the whole time we were having dinner.  No refills, no follow up, and the service is definitely  Not as polite as other locations.  Too bad because I really like the food here and the hostess gave a good first impression.  4 stars for food, one star for service.  Sorry Jasmin, you failed"
Edie M.,"Torrance, CA",10,14,1,4.0,2/23/2015,Love this place...one of my favorites!  Good food and service. Always clean and near the water which is nice.  Sometimes long waits although you can eat in the bar.  Parking is a pain but that is a city issue really.  A little pricey but worth it as the portions are huge - easily second meal at home the next day!
Daniela D.,"Downtown Brooklyn, NY",1,8,22,4.0,1/26/2015,Best pesto pasta I've ever ate! And I've in Italy a lot. Just the portions are too big in generally.. Impossible to leave this restaurant without leftovers..
Ivan C.,"Mission Valley, San Diego, CA",21,95,17,1.0,11/11/2014,"Worst food I have tried over the last years .I have no idea why always is busy.Pasta and salads are average , but the chocolate cake was just okay."
Daniel C.,"Inglewood, CA",62,32,15,3.0,12/13/2014,"First time coming to this location been coming to cheesecake factory for years now an yesterday was the worst experience ever... We got there a family of 5 we were seated right  away . We sat for about 25-30 minutes and no service i would understand that if it was really packed with people but there was about 5 familys that were already eating. Usually we get seated and get treated wonderful and get bread for our wait but we didnt get none of that love like other locations asoon as the waiter got there we were really upset he took our order and they brought bread 2 minutes before we got out meal, so we litteraly waited 45 min to get bread on our table , im giving the food a 10 just because the lousiana chicken pasta never let me down but the service was awful. Really upset at this place wont come here anymore. Giving this place 3 stars because the food was great 50/50 but didnt enjoy the wait."
Ana R.,"Portland, OR",53,341,28,5.0,5/24/2013,"We went here today for lunch. We got seated right away, our server Obi was very attentive and came to check on us several times. I ordered the polenta fries and pretzel-crusted chicken (small plate menu) and my hubby ordered the orange chicken. Food was on our table within 15 minutes. Our sodas were refilled (we didn't even have to ask for it) Very happy with this location."
Shirley M. J.,"Folsom, CA",178,1058,6484,5.0,7/24/2011,"My ex-tenant, Hector and I decided we would go sightseeing around Los Angeles and Orange Counties.  As a result of our sightseeing excursion around 7:30 PM, we ended our daytrip at Cheesecake Factory. We ordered a few items from the Cheesecake Factory menu:  Chocoloate Mousse Cake and coffee, and a couple of appetizers.  One of the appetizers we ordered tasted quite odd, so we told our waitress we didn't like the taste. Wow!  Our waitress was soooo cool!  Surprisingly, our waitress took the appetizer and deducted from our bill!  So AWESOME!  The cheesecake as always is sinfully, undeniably delectable!  I think I like this location verses the Cheesecake Factory locations in Corte Madera, Marina Del Rey, Beverly Hills, San Francisco . . . Why?  Oh-the ambiance is oh, so romantic sitting at the window facing the Redondo Beach Harbor.   Hence, the evening's ambiance was warm and inviting.  I know I will return to Rendondo Beach Cheesecake Factory."
Rich G.,"Torrance, CA",2,21,2,4.0,5/12/2014,"Forced valet parking at $4.00 not counting the obligatory tip is bogus.  Can nobody walk thirty yards from a parking space to the entrance anymore?  The irony is that if you're eating at the cheesecake factory, you need to be walking it off.  On that note, their tiramisu cake (not the cheesecake) is one of the best things on this planet.  I'd nuke another continent for a lifetime supply."
G G.,"Long Beach, CA",33,582,4380,5.0,1/12/2015,Food is always on point...Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp is my go to dish. Thai curry style coconut chili sauce with tender chicken amd shrimp over rice. Damn tasty. NOTE: This location is valet only.
Linda C.,"Manhattan Beach, CA",17,91,466,5.0,6/20/2011,"My review is for The Cheesecake Factory Redondo Beach Banquet Facility, as many people do not realize that upstairs hosts wedding receptions, bridal showers, meetings and functions.   I had a destination wedding and returned to the Southbay for a local wedding reception.   We chose the Cheesecake Factory for a few reasons...  1) LOCATION/VIEW - Absolutely breath taking views of the Redondo Beach Marina.  We had an incredible sunset at our reception. 2) THE COORDINATORS - Jackie and Addie the Event Planning Staff were absolutely incredible!  The were so awesome to work with!   Kind, patient and ever so professional!    3) THE VALUE - We all know the Cheesecake factory is ever so yummy, but since we already had a destination wedding and reception, searching for a local venue that was reasonable and offered an incredible view was far and few in between.   We had a sit down served dinner for 100 people and even with a full restaurant downstairs the food was prompt, warm and delicious!   The room can open to accommodate small parties and large, they offer a bar/bar service, and even a room that can accommodate a ceremony (though we didn't use that one).   The bathrooms are separated from the restaurant's general bathroom and you would hardly know there is a bustling restaurant below.  Unlike other venues, they also included the linens and dance floor.   To us this was very important, it meant a lot to get a lot for your money, where many other venues had facility/venue fee's and minimums before you even got to your food.   Where the Cheesecake Factory did have a minimum, you were meeting the minimum while getting your food, linens and a priceless view.    I can't say enough about the wonderful team of Jackie and Addy!  They were wonderful!"
Brittany P.,"Los Angeles, CA",78,41,3,4.0,10/29/2014,"The have a $5 happy hour menu! Am i the last to find out about this? Tex Mex Egg rolls, Artichoke Spinach dip are both on as well as the mojito and margarita! Plus the views of the boats and the ocean are so relaxing. I hate to admit it but I'm a fan."
Supajok C.,"San Pedro, CA",38,21,14,2.0,5/16/2014,"The food was delicious, the service was subpar. Our empty bread and appetizer dishes sat on our tiny table throughout our entire meal, cramping our enjoyment , despite 20 or more passes by staff members."
Jules L.,"Torrance, CA",40,44,71,5.0,6/30/2013,garlic noodle was the best! love the atmosphere because it's right next to the beach. Valet is $4 btw.
Vito M.,"Torrance, CA",0,47,,1.0,2/8/2013,"Well I have been here over a dozen time,more like dragged my wife,daughters and granddaughter like this place . Must be the view of the harbor . The service is terrible, when they don't even have sweeteners on the table and you have to ask for then for your tea and coffee, You also have to ask for bread they don't want you filling up on bread and not ordering dessert . I tried the meatloaf this time it was on the lunch menu , the only people who would say this is good are people who's mom didn't know how to cook . The horse was kicking me all the way home . I haven't found anything I have eaten here over the years I have been dragged here that is palatable but the cheesecake. There are much better choices the Bluewater grill has great food and the same view. Hell I like Norm's better than this place."
