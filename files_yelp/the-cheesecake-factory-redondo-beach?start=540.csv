Nykeia T.,"Upland, CA",0,16,7,5.0,11/19/2014,"Just had dinner with my sister and this was the best experience EVER!! This was my first time at this location but I must say it was my best. Crystal was my waitress and she's an absolute doll! If you go make sure to sit with her, she will not disappoint. The manager on duty was a sweetie as well, both ladies made my late night dinner one to remember. I will definitely be back. Delicious! Extraordinary customer experience to say the least."
Vjustin C.,"Hawthorne, CA",59,126,11,4.0,9/17/2014,"Pretty good place, I love their selection of cheesecake and the entrees can almost always be shared! Downside is it's mostly valet if you don't like parking along the street. Not in a busy area either. Great view of the marina."
McKenzie P.,"Manhattan Beach, CA",0,7,1,5.0,12/5/2013,"Bottom Line: For being a chain restaurant, The Cheesecake Factory sure knows how to deliver. I may have been to many different restaurants of this branch, but this location in particular has now become my favorite. First of all, this location is BEAUTIFUL! I dined here a few nights ago for an early dinner, which meant that my friend are I were able to catch the stunning winter sunset. We chose to sit outside on the patio, and were fortunate enough to be sat at one of the table right by the window. It was a little chilly at first, but after getting settled in, we were able to feel the warmth from the heaters that are scattered all along the patio area. I'll give them one star for their convenient patio with an amazing view. The food here is actually pretty tasty. I ordered the chicken costoletta, and it was so delicious! The chicken was crispy fried, yet it wasn't oily like normal fried chicken. This chicken dish came with some type of creamy lemon sauce, which seemed a little weird to me at first, but it ended up complementing the fried chicken very well. Another star for their killer costoletta. And of course, I couldn't miss out on some cheesecake! My server did her whole show of telling us about the cheesecakes that they're featuring, and also mentioned that one of which that they offered would lead to the company giving 25 cents to Feeding America for every slice sold. I thought that was a pretty nice gesture from the company. My friend and I decided to share a slice of the chocolate tuxedo cheesecake, and my oh my was it amazing! The cheesecake had a perfect mixture of cream and chocolate, maybe even a hint of vanilla? Well whatever is in it sure gave me a reason to add another star. The ambiance at the restaurant was really nice too. Sitting out on the patio was very relaxing. I could feel the cool crisp winter air, but I was still safe from shivering in the cold. The music and talking from other customers seemed very quiet, and it was very easy to have an intimate conversation without feeling like I was yelling to my friend. The patio's calm environment got another star out of me. And finally, the very last star. Why did  I give this restaurant five stars? Well, not only did their food and location make my time here enjoyable, it was also the service. Every employee that came in contact with our table was very kind and helpful. They have so many staff people working here, and I love it! Never once did I feel like I had to search to find someone who could help me."
Jefferson C.,"Torrance, CA",47,144,55,4.0,4/20/2012,"This cheesecake factory is awesome. Located right in the redondo beach kings harbor, indoor and outdoor seating is available.  Beautiful view as you eat, and service here is always great here.  I highly reccomend the spicy chashew chicken dish it's awesome.  Also the macaroni cheese balls appetizer are really good.  My favorite cheesecake is the red velvet and snickers.  Also the strawberry short cake is delicious."
M R.,"Culver City, CA",11,140,50,3.0,6/21/2013,"Hit or miss,  service and food can be both great or Meh..depending on how busy they are  Awesome view of Marina if you seat outside . Right on the beach. Food is text book Cheesecake.. ,large  portions of  decent interpretations of international haute  Cuisine."
Dorian R.,"Pomona, CA",70,164,66,2.0,9/7/2014,"I've never been a fan of the Cheesecake Factory; it's always crowded and whenever it's crowded the ability of the staff to properly do their jobs goes straight out the window. Me and my family made reservations, and we still had to wait 30 minutes for them to find us a table. And when we finally did get a table, it was in a location that was busy with constant foot traffic and the servers wouldn't keep the door closed so we always ended up with cold air hitting us. If you're looking for a dining experience, I would pick another location or establishment. Great view, but the hassle of the experience isn't worth it. In fact, I would suggest getting take out if possible."
Penny O.,"Los Angeles, CA",7,94,,3.0,5/29/2013,"Came here for lunch, very nice view of the harbor! Cool patio seating. Valet parking only 2.50 for lunch, 4.00 for dinner. Got pasta carbonara lunch portion, it was good, he got chicken parmesan sandwich said it was good. Service was very slow. Share a piece of fresh strawberry cheesecake! Yummmmm! Tasty. Its gets really busy."
Michelle W.,"Manhattan Beach, CA",2,28,,3.0,9/13/2013,Nice view of the bay.  The food os what you would expect from the cheese cake factory.  Good!  Great with the kids! Just changed to a 3 star from a 4 star review because the silverware has been dirty the last few times I've gone it.
Jane G.,"Hawthorne, CA",3,4,,5.0,1/6/2016,"My son was looking for a nice restaurant to take me to for my birthday.  We decided on this restaurant.  I must say we were not disappointed.  Our server was very friendly and very anxious to please us.  After receiving several appetizers very quickly,  we received our main course without a long wait.  The food was delicious.  We each ordered the bang bang chicken and shrimp. Planning on eating here again very soon,"
Jamie S.,"Manhattan Beach, CA",269,87,60,5.0,5/18/2012,"I went here to celebrate Mother's day with my sister and my mom. Although the servers said that we'd have to wait for 50 minutes before we get a table, they were able to give us a table 20 minutes after we checked in. I understood that it was a hectic schedule to go there, but the server that we had was very apologetic and accommodating. He made sure that we had everything we needed. What's more interesting was that the chef went out of his way to give my mom his complimentary soup due to the delay of her dish. The manager checked up on us to make sure that we were having a grand time. And another server went up to me to say I looked great in my dress, and that our last name sounds pretty. Although it sounds rather rambling and long, it's a descriptive summary on my most recent experience at this Cheesecake Factory. PHYSICAL:  Beautiful interior. The water from the waterview outside reflects so much light, you barely need any fixture light till nighttime. FOOD: Great food, if not better than the other couple of Cheesecake Factories I've tried. SERVICE: Awesome service, even on a busy day. OVERALL: Great experience, even on a busy day"
Vicki L.,"Redondo Beach, CA",37,17,34,4.0,10/13/2014,A much needed change  in the kitchen must have been made since my last visit. . I have been back twice since my last post and have been happy. The service was great. Adrian is a attentive server that creates a nice dining experience.
Daryl C.,"Redondo Beach, CA",2152,637,434,4.0,9/11/2012,"Still good food... Went there for my birthday, wanted some good jambalaya really bad...  What I got was a mixture of bell peppers, onions, tomatoes, chicken & shrimp cooked in a fry pan with some nice spices and then poured over rice.  Although tasty, it isn't jambalaya. Still good service & atmosphere, and I'm still hungry for jambalaya."
Sofia V.,"Los Angeles, CA",1331,196,887,4.0,8/21/2014,"We've been there only 1 time and our experienced was pretty good , their chicken wings , guacamole , and their stuffed chicken tortillas it was good , to drink i had their passion fruit mojito and their passion fruit martini and it they were  pretty good , hubby took home a dulce de leche cheesecake but he wasnt that impressed about it , we will be back to try other cheesecakes :)"
Omar B.,"Playa del Rey, CA",0,12,,1.0,10/26/2015,Ordered food and had lipstick stain on my water cup.  The waitress just said sorry and replaced the cup.  I ended up not drinking water for the rest of my time there.  I don't think I'll come back to this location.
Nicole V.,"Darby, PA",0,3,1,4.0,8/2/2011,"Went here for the first time with my gf back in March. We were seated outside by the water but they have heaters so we couldn't feel the chill in the air. Beautiful view at sunset. The food was delicious and quick service, the waitress always seemed to be around when we needed more water or something. Had the spicy jambalaya and red velvet cheesecake, both delicious.  I'm a fan and am going again next week. Just not a fan of the valet parking that seems to be mandatory."
Amber J.,"Portland, OR",592,133,70,5.0,3/24/2014,"My boyfriend took me here for my birthday last week. Came on a Friday night around 7p with no reservation. Got seated within 15 mins. Our server or shall I say, two servers were awesome. We were quite impressed with how personable and genuine they were. I wish I remembered their names. For some reason Katerina is standing out? Anywho, thanks for the great service. Meal was amazing too."
Cara C.,"Torrance, CA",50,30,34,2.0,5/12/2014,"Really bad service and the food was not as near as good as I remember. The mash potatos had hunks of potato, which normally is very good, however these chunks were undercooked.  We had several different servers which was really annoying and it took more than 15 minutes to get dessert. I mean how long does it take to go get a piece of cheesecake? I will not be going back."
Antho L.,"Los Angeles, CA",2528,1028,4472,5.0,9/12/2007,Great!  Everything was just great! This is a great Cheesecake Factory location as I've celebrated many great birthdays and gotten together with great friends here over the 20 great years I've lived in this great city of ours. Here's what's great about this restaurant:   Great ambiance! Great marina view! Great sunset!   Great brown bread!   Great calamari appetizer! Great Santa Fe chicken salad! Great passion fruit iced tea! Great white chocolate raspberry cheesecake! Great coffee! Great service!   Great company! Great time! Wasn't this a great review?
Linda C.,"Las Vegas, NV",22,41,19,5.0,8/29/2015,"Burgers......huge..delicious...sweet potatoe fries, wonderful. The cheesecake selections were so many to choose from..I had the praline caramel and it was superb. I eat often at cheesecake factory restaurants and never was disappointed. Parking was tough so we had to valet park which was 4.00. That is expensive but then again its California. Bathrooms were very clean."
