Howard S.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",3,5,,1.0,10/7/2014,This happened a few weeks back. My daughter called to make reservations and asked if there was a wait right now for a window booth . She was told no wait to come on down . We were there in under 5 minutes.  When we got there we were told there would be a 15 to 20 minute wait as we did not have reservations we were just told that we did not need. So we left. A few weeks before that I took a friend to lunch there. We were seated at a window seat and our order was taken. 35 minutes later we still did not receive our food. We left . On the way out the manager asked me if I wanted her to pack up our food which apparently had been sitting.   This used to be a great restaurant and I often took people there. I will not be returning again.
Patricia L.,"Los Angeles, CA",116,95,44,3.0,8/13/2014,"My family and I went on a Wednesday night and service was fairly quick. Half of our party was already seated so upon walking in, I asked the hostess for the table but she misheard the name it was under and so we ended up guessing names. Front of the line service needs a little work. However we had an amazing server even though I forgot her name. She was very attentive and even lowered the ac since it was freezing. Nonetheless, amazing food and great servers!"

Hector E.,"South Gate, CA",0,8,2,3.0,8/18/2013,"I went there for my birthday thinking it would be fun, once I went in there we got sat pretty fast, but when we ordered the food , WOW it took really long for them to bring it, the food isn't all that I got a Kobe Burger, but it tasted really greasy  Would I go back? Probably not"
Tiffany G.,"Studio City, CA",40,316,31,4.0,12/24/2012,"Cheesecake factory will always have the same style and taste where ever you go, that is plus so you know exactly what you're getting. Of course, Sundays are pretty busy, but the weight wasn't too bad. Can't go wrong with their bread and ask for some extra salad dressings as dipping sauce, delicious! Favorite app has to be the avocado egg rolls, yuuum! I had the pan seared salmon, great dish! Service was great the staff was very helpful. Top it all off we had the Kahlua cheesecake for dessert, again can't go wrong with Cheesecake factory!"
Nicole L.,"Torrance, Los Angeles, CA",160,30,1,5.0,5/5/2013,"I always have a good time at the factory.  Their red velvet cheesecake is so delicious, and a huge portion perfect for sharing! I usually order the crab wontons and the fettuccini with chicken and tomatoes. Sure, the menu is HUGE, but they're just trying to make sure everyone customer at the table gets to eat what they want. Service Is usually good, no complaints so far. Sure, the self-parking lot is small, but if you go on off-peak times, you'll probably get a free parking spot and avoid a long wait."
Harvey K.,"Redondo Beach, CA",8,23,2,5.0,7/30/2014,Always good.  Always busy. National Cheesecake Day! What was I thinking! Great service and the the food is consistently fantastic! Thank you!
Kim H.,"Los Angeles, CA",451,911,481,4.0,5/7/2012,It is not the Cheesecake Factory itself that reserves the 4 stars....it is the location and the physical design of the building and the interior / outdoor seating.  You get Cheesecake quality of food and drinks but the bar is amazing....open rooftop with the sun blazing in or sit outside and overlook the marina.  One of the best ones we have seen to date.
Helen C.,"Torrance, CA",36,505,126,2.0,1/4/2013,"More like 2 1/2..  this is just based on our food. We ordered: SWEET CORN TAMALE CAKES: this was good with the first byte, Too much sour cream on it. Made it really heavy and soggy JAMAICAN SHRIMP: Had this in Philly and it was super good. It was just ok... The shrimp seemed a little old..meaning it didn't seem like it was cooked to order. I would've liked my beans a little softer. The sauce was delicious though... Our server Derrick was great... Didn't like the fact they you HAVE to valet your car ($4)..."
Brett D.,"Hermosa Beach, CA",8,11,,4.0,4/12/2014,I live blocks away and mostly come for the happy hour menu that extends large yummy appetizers for half the price ($5).  I like to eat so after 3 ($15) I am more then satiated.  Can't go wrong for the deal
David S.,"Redondo Beach, CA",0,9,,4.0,10/10/2014,"Excellent family restaurant, the outside deck is particularly nice, especially at night. Good food, good atmosphere and reasonable prices. I would definitely recommend this place."
Mary K.,"Torrance, CA",56,37,16,5.0,5/3/2014,"Can't go wrong with The Cheesecake Factory and a great evening to sit on the patio with a view. After a pineapple Moscow Mule in the bar, I settled on spicy cashew chicken and a salad. Mark had a shrimp platter. Both were yummy! Too bad no room for dessert!"
T A.,"Redondo Beach, CA",4,177,5,2.0,12/19/2012,"The food is okay - nothing wonderful, nothing overly horrible.  There are dishes  I've eaten here that taste good, but it is chain restaurant food and nothing innovative or exciting.  Usually we only come here at someone else's request - but I've never had any huge complaints about it.  It's not my first choice, but we leave full and reasonably pleased.  Recently, however, we had a meal here, and I left feeling pretty dissatisfied.  The drinks: overpriced and weak. The only upside was that I tried a daiquiri and it was made with fresh fruit, yum. But really, $23 plus tip for 2 mediocre mai tais?  Jeeze.  We were here late afternoon and the sun was pouring through the windows, which we were seated next to. Way too bright (necessitated some of us wearing sunglasses), and they don't have any kind of shades?! The service was spotty. Waitress was nice enough, but not really on it. One member of our party was left waiting a good 10 minutes for their food after the rest of us had been served. Really uncool. They have an extensive list of cheesecakes, yet didn't have the first two I attempted to order. Not the biggest deal of the day, just irritating on top of everything else.  Pausing here to say that the reason I give it 2 stars is because of the cheesecake. Only great thing about this place. I love the carrot cake cheesecake, caramel pecan turtle, vanilla bean, strawberry, chocolate tuxedo - really, every one I've tried is great.  I think if I ever return, I'm skipping everything else and just having cheesecake.  The kicker during this most recent visit is that when our bill arrived, one of the items was priced higher than it is shown on the menu. It was only a dollar, but that's not the point. Update the menus to reflect current prices, jeeze! At the end of the day, we paid about $100 total for lunch (for two) and cheesecake, with 3 alcoholic beverages and a strawberry lemonade - and not only did I feel that we didn't get our money's worth, but I could have made a much tastier, healthier lunch at home for less than 1/5 the cost, and with a lot less stress.   Icing on the cake:  I became physically ill before even leaving the premises.  Good times."
Robert G.,"Rancho Palos Verdes, CA",12,71,1,4.0,12/19/2012,"The food is consistently good at this location.  Try the Moroccan chicken, spicy with honey raisins and couscous.  The white chocolate, caramel, macadamia nut cheesecake is to die for.  The menu is seriously comprehensive.   Service is attentive and looking out at the marina provides a nice ambiance.  My only knock would be that the restaurant is noisy, but with kids that is not a bad thing.  Good value overall."
Ben H L.,"Santa Clara, CA",304,1561,73,4.0,1/4/2010,"The Cheesecake Factory is a chain, portions are big, menu is huge, yada yada yada, but this one stands out for different reasons.  First, it's not super crowded like Northern California CF's where it usually involves an hour wait or so.  Second, the patio view of the beach and ocean during the day is amazing and worth a trip down for a nice lunch.  Third, the service is pretty good since they have less customers to cover. Drawbacks:  Valet parking, no choice to self park but only $3.50 and only two draft beers on tap.  Hey come on now!  How about at least three or four more?"
Belle B.,"Walnut, CA",155,914,12842,4.0,10/1/2010,"Went here for lunch today with a friend.  The valet parking is nice, but for $2.50 I would have preferred to park my own car - if self parking was an option.  We wanted to sit outside, but for some reason they couldn't accomodate the request.  They did sit us at a table with a full marina view. The view is really beautiful, but the sun kept getting in our eyes which was a little bothersome.  My friend ordered coffee and the lunch chinese chicken salad.  The salad came without dressing and with a ton of fried noodles.  When the waitress came back with the dressed salad, she actually put more noodles on the salad.  My friend said the salad was good.  The positive was that they were really attentive with her coffee.  They were quick to offer refills and were very conscious of keeping her coffee warm. I had the renee's special: 1/2 turkey sandwhich, clam chowder and a salad.  It was perfect.  I had them put a ton of fresh ground pepper on my salad and soup.  Truthfully, I should have asked for tabasco for my soup (a little bland).  Other than that it was great. They let us sit and talk for hours (we had not seen each other in a long time) with no pressure since it was later in the afternoon.  I have been to a private party upstairs at this location before - which is a great option for a banquet or large gathering.  They  have a private bar and dining area upstairs.  Highly recommended!"
Tom M.,"Redondo Beach, CA",156,529,126,2.0,11/15/2012,"I really like their outdoor patio. But as the sun slowly sinks over the Redondo Harbor marina in the west, so sinks the quality of this place. Fascinatingly, as quality goes down, the portions seem to get even bigger.  Apparently, that's their business plan: big plates of uninspired food people can't finish. I know people see it as a value, but what's the value of bland leftovers in take-out containers drying out in your refrigerator? To be fair, there are some big protein items they do well with, such as a herb crusted Salmon. But otherwise, I just don't understand the attraction of their heaping bowls of enormous calories. I would rather have a standard portion and pay less! Which brings me to the ""light"" menu. Good on them for doing one. Bad on them for not understanding the concept. I had a 560 calorie meal of chicken breasts and tomatoes. But if I'm watching calories, why do I need THREE chicken breasts? One good quality breast would be welcome rather than the trio of dry, pounded, overcooked pieces I received.  Excessive is the rule at TCF, including the cheesecake (which does taste good). And while one piece for a family of 4 is plenty, why do you have to insult it with a mountain of spray whip cream? To make it look bigger than the calorie bomb it already is? To turn your liver to fois gras before the check arrives? Is there complimentary valet parking for paramedics? Attention America: we don't need this much food. The entire country of Brazil doesn't need this much food. And while the idea of leftovers obviously appeals to so many, there is a huge amount of food wasted at each and every outlet.  Personally, I find that more disgusting than any of their fat-laden menu items could ever be."
Farwah N.,"Los Angeles, CA",105,324,40,3.0,6/11/2014,"It's like any other chain. Good food, consistent taste and now you can buy the salad dressings and bring them home!"
Patrice M.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,5,,1.0,5/30/2012,"I wish I could give this location zero stars. I visited this location with my mother on 5/27/12. I figured it would be a great place to have my first alcoholic drink since I had turned 21 earlier this month. It started off good. We had a short wait time and a nice server.  But then our food took forever to come out. I ordered my usual - the Shrimp and Chicken Gumbo.  At this point I still didn't have a problem. They were having difficulties in the kitchen and I wasn't starving, so it was fine. A manager came to check on us and I felt that was very nice of him. Later on I received my food which was great until I found a piece of hair in it. A PIECE OF HAIR IN MY FOOD! It was completely gross especially since I had eaten a good portion of the food.  It was a long thin strand buried down in my dish. I have never ever found hair in my food while eating at ANY Cheesecake Factory Restaurant.  I politely notified the server and he quickly took the plate away. Moments later a manager came and I asked me if I'd like anything else. I said I'd want my same dish to go. BIG MISTAKE. Of course my food ended up being complimentary but I received another surprise when I got home. I went to eat my food yesterday 5/29/12 and it was BURNT. I honestly could not believe it, it was like someone played a cruel joke on me. First, there's hair in my food then they send me home with a burnt meal.  I am very disappointed and disgusted at this Cheesecake Factory Location. From now on I'll ONLY go to the one in Glendale or the Grove. What's funny is that I started to ask the manager for a free drink instead of another meal and now I really wish I had of. Next time I go to a restaurant and something is wrong with my food, I'll ask for a drink instead.  LESSON LEARNED."
Epic View T.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,36,19,3.0,5/13/2013,"I went last night to celebrate Mother's Day with my sister and cousin. It was packed! Instead of waiting 40 minutes to be seated, we opted to go to the bar area. We shared avocado egg rolls, fried calamari and the tortilla salad! The food was served fast and it was delish. We then ordered the Kahlua Cheesecake with brownie base topped with chocolate ganache. Yum! Our server Clinton was fun ...but he could have been more attentive. As the rush was dying down, the place looked overstaffed with servers too busy catching up with each other instead of being guest focused!"
