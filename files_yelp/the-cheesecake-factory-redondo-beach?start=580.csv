Jessica B.,"Los Angeles, CA",51,10,3,4.0,5/8/2013,"I love TCF! Always good food, friendly staff, and the best hot bread around! Lol :) This location is walkable from my home. There's always plenty of sitting and whether you choose to dine inside or out... you will have a very nice view. There is big windows all along the marina side. Its so nice to have a lunch date and see a little seal friend too.  I recommend getting the veggie burger. Its my favorite. Don't be afraid of the red coloring (due to the beets used in the patty). Just a heads up!"
Amy S.,"Los Angeles, CA",92,49,72,5.0,7/1/2014,Went on 6-19-14 for the hubs birthday food was great view was amazing. Got seated within 20 min w/out reservations which is awesome for this place! The waitress although was a little older guessing 50s and she wasn't engaging she didn't come back and ask us if we were ready to order she just took drink orders and left (we were ready to order dinner) but she ran off b4 I could catch her lol. It was like that te entire dinner. But I love this place!
Cindy C.,"Los Angeles, CA",65,153,21,5.0,4/3/2012,"Went here for my boyfriends graduation dinner, was a Monday night and the wait was short about 5 mins. Service was great, food was super yum! I had the garlic noodles with shrimp, it was soooo good, asparagus and mushrooms were so good, and it had just the right amount of garlic, mmm mmm yumm! Everyone was super happy witH their meals and the vanilla bean cheesecake was wow!  Everything was perfect!"
Cynthia A.,"Long Beach, CA",417,535,108,4.0,8/25/2012,"Let them eat CHEESECAKE! I've always been a big fan of The Cheesecake Factory because their menu is so extensive. There is something for everyone...salads, burgers, sandwiches, seafood, pizza, chicken, steak, etc. I've tasted many entrees but I must say my favorite is the Chicken Madeira. Two large chicken breasts smothered with cheese, sauce, mushrooms, and asparagus served with a large side of mashed potatoes...YUM! I always have leftovers.  This is the type of restaurant one must save room for dessert...and there are plenty of choices. I absolutely love the Dulce de Leche cheesecake and Tiramisu cheesecake.  The slices are big enough to share. They even decorate the plate if it's a special occasion...I'm always a fan of seeing my name spelled out with chocolate sauce :)  The staff at this location is very friendly and service is great. Love sitting outside or by the windows because the view of the ocean is beautiful. Great place to host parties, go on a date, or spend happy hour (M-F 4p-8p). They have good specials on food and drinks.  Parking is valet for $3.50 or there is self-park off to the right when you drive in."
Priya T.,"Torrance, CA",0,17,,4.0,8/4/2015,This is a nice place to have a late evening dinner when most of the restaurants have closed. I love that the menu has so many choices that you can never get bored. Humble note to management: The terrible parking and a long wait is the reason people avoid this place most of the times. Address these two problems and your customer base will increase manyfolds.
B H.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,2.0,1/19/2015,"I have enjoyed my visits to this location in the past. I would not suggest taking a large party here as they do not take reservations. I called a week in advance to try and reserve a table for 25. We were celebrating my mom's 76th birthday. I was told they do not take reservations and it was suggested that I arrive an 1/2 an hour to 45 minutes before our planned dinner time to ensure we would be seated close to our planned 6 pm dinner time. I arrived an hour early. I was told we would be seated about 6:30. That didn't seem unreasonable.  Well...at 7:10, I had about lost my patience.  We were finally seated. We had two servers. Average service at best. One was actually indifferent. My husband's food came to the table about 15-20 minutes after everyone else was served. To top it off, he ordered a turkey burger and they brought him a ground beef burger. The manager comped his meal, which was nice. Bottom line...I'll never plan a big family dinner here in the future. We'll take our $600 bill to a restaurant that takes reservations."
Marcel P.,"Flower Mound, TX",2,3,,3.0,7/8/2014,Chicken Madeira was okay. The restaurant is very noisy and you can barely have a conversation.
John S.,"Agoura Hills, CA",139,137,52,5.0,5/26/2014,"With the largest food menu I have ever seen, it is always possible to find something delicious (and high in calories) on their menu. It's always busy here, so getting it can be a challenge. The wait can be 45-90 minutes, but the food is good and the drinks are yummy."
Patrick R.,"San Pedro, Los Angeles, CA",0,5,3,3.0,7/20/2014,"These guys can cook a steak and unsurprisingly, do a mean cheesecake."
Maysah F.,"Los Angeles, CA",13,140,14,1.0,10/2/2013,"Dear Cheesecake Factory staff, when a guest drives an hour to get to your location so they can enjoy the view of the ocean, do not deny them the right to do so when they kindly ask to be seated next to the window. I had to ask twice, and even when the second staff member said yes to me, I can hear her coworker asking ""wait, what?"" How rude. The tables are meant to be used not left empty especially the ones with a view. Respect your guests' requests. I lost my taste in this location, thanks a lot."
Vince V.,"Costa Mesa, CA",38,12,4,1.0,7/15/2014,Sunday afternoon on a nice day is not the time to visit this restaurant.   Hard to say the cause but almost everything they did was wrong from the moment of losing the table they were going to seat us at to taking over 10 minutes to do the set up and greeting by the wait staff to blowing a simple menu order.  Very disappointing.  At least I did not have to pay for parking which is excessive in the valet lot.  Not a location I am willing to retry although I like the chain.
Edrick F.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,4,,5.0,8/10/2014,"Good views, great food, and amazing service! Just had lunch here with a few friends and left feeling completely satisfied. I recommend asking for a seat outside to get a great view of the docks, especially if the weather is right. The food came out perfect (I had the Famous Factory Meatloaf and tried the Original Cheese Cake, AMAZING) and in a timely manner. What made my visit even better was the service. Our server was courteous and catered our every need. We never needed to ask for anything because our server was on top of it. If i remember correctly I think our servers name was Axl. If you ever eat at this establishment ask for this guy because he is awesome and will make your visit worth it. Give this man a raise!"
Melissa C.,"Torrance, CA",2,9,,4.0,7/12/2014,"Great view! Took a long time to get a simple margarita, but besides that - not a bad experience. Good food."
Sean S.,"Oakland, CA",365,929,5,2.0,4/12/2014,"So I'm going to start by saying you know what you're getting with this place. But I was terribly disappointed that they have only a Gardenburger and some pasta or pieces as their vegetarian selections. Fine you could get meat taken out of some of the dishes but it's 2013, come on here."
G S.,"Redondo Beach, CA",2,18,,4.0,3/20/2012,"I have been coming here for years and I love it! It was actually my new year's resolution one year to try every single cheesecake they had and what do you know, it was the only new year's resolution I have ever kept! My favorite cheesecake, white chocolate caramel latte, was actually gotten rid of, so my new favorites are pumpkin pecan, red velvet, or the tuxedo. You really can't go wrong with any cheesecake though, or any of their other cakes. (I love the Chocolate Truffle Cake the most) The food there rarely lets me down too. I've had most of their appetizers and my top picks are the fried macncheese balls, the avocado rolls, the spinach and cheese dip, the buffalo blasts, or the firecracker salmon rolls. Out of their pastas, I love the four-cheese pasta, the carbonara, or the farfalle with chicken and garlic. Their salads are amazing too, I usually never order salads when I go out because I never feel like its really that satisfying, but at the cheesecake factory, they are tasty enough as a meal and definitely fill me up, especially the BBQ chicken or the luau salad. Their burgers are always a solid choice too. The only things I've gotten there that I wouldnt get again are the fish and chips, which I thought were bland, and the belgium waffle, which was just like any other belgium waffle.  Anddd of course, I can't forget about the amazing bread they start you off with! Lets just say its a struggle for me to not fill up on the bread; got to have the bread... The only problem that I have with this place, you can't make reservations."
Gayle T.,"Torrance, CA",6,8,,5.0,2/18/2012,"Herb crusted salmon (lunch menu) was the perfect size for this petite diner! The salmon was moist and seasoned perfectly.  Three spears of asparagus and garlic mashed potatoes with cream sauce were perfect companions. Also enjoyed a glass of Chardonnay (house) that didn't over power the meal. My friend ordered a Tuxedo Cheesecake for dessert which she thoroughly enjoyed! It was served with swirls of whipped cream and chocolate design along the edge of the plate.  We arrived at 11:30 beating the Saturday lunch crowd. There are only a few self park spaces so valet it was ($3.50 before tip). We were seated with no wait and the waitress was prompt. This was the only time I've been asked if I wanted bread while deciding what to order. Usually, it's always served without inquiry."
Carri M.,"Hawthorne, CA",40,162,11,4.0,9/22/2013,"Caesar Salad!!! The best I have ever had or possible will ever have. But really, all their food is excellent - especially considering that their menu is a book and are serving so many different types of regional foods.  For example, I tried the fry bread sandwich and was not expecting that they would be able to produce a fry bread I was accustomed to getting at a pow wow. But let me tell you, it was just as good. There is no doubt they do a good cheesecake and have more varieties than you can choose from.  People, let me tell you that there is a reason that this place is always busy. They do good food. Service can be hit and miss."
Di R.,"Los Angeles, CA",584,358,116,5.0,9/15/2009,"I meant to write a review after my last visit here but due to a busy schedule, I have to say that I have blown it off until now. I took a group of close friends here for my daughter's 21st birthday on March 15th. this year. She had celebrated all weekend but this was her actual birthday.  I had called several weeks ahead and was told that they do not take reservations. Coming from the industry I am not sure how smart that is but I must say that one of the servers told me to ask for her and call that morning with the head count and they would be ready for us. They were! My friend and I got there early with balloons etc... had a drink and by the time we were done, we had the table set for our party window seat and all.  We had the best service, and the food is always great anyway. Some think it is a little over priced but with a party of 12 with a few extra salads and appetizers and a couple alcoholic drinks we still got out of there for under $300! This was the last of all the parties for her 21st  so I still wanted to make sure it was special but it didn't have to be the best one and it turned out feeling like we had paid double.  The staff treated us all great and I am sorry to say it took so long to write this that I have forgotten names but I would definitely recommend this restaurant for a quick bite or a special occassion where the food is consistently good!"
Rudy S.,"Cypress, CA",482,124,68,4.0,7/21/2011,"Good food, huge menu with many items to choose from. Their portions are bigger than average. Their cheesecake is some of the best out there, but kinda pricey (averaging $7 a slice).  They get 4 stars because of their horrible parking situation. They charge $3.50 for valet, which in my opinion, should be free. I'm already paying for my meal, why must I be forced to pay for parking?  Sitting outside on a warm day or a cool night is a perk."
Tawny S.,"Rancho Palos Verdes, CA",20,63,10,4.0,8/17/2012,"I love this place. This a really nice restaurant for families and dates. They have great selection of food and is very well made. The waitresses are very sweet and friendly. They have good portions and are reasonably priced. The only downsides would be the valet parking and you can't make reservations. I also went to a big party there a couple months ago. They did a great job with everything including bar area, food and decorating. Very pretty restaurant."
