Becca B.,"Riverside, CA",2,9,14,2.0,6/3/2017,"Not impressed with the food here last night unfortunately. I had the Truffle Honey Fried Chicken which completely lacked flavor. It just tasted like bland fried chicken. I was also disappointed that the asparagus that came with it was completely unseasoned, just plain cooked asparagus. I found that very strange. My boyfriend had the Chipotle Spicy Crispy Chicken Sandwich and we were also surprised by the lack of flavor in this dish as well. I would say these are both menu items to avoid. The French fries however were very good and their fresh bread never disappoints but that's just about the only positive thing I have to say about the food we ordered."
Tracy W.,"San Francisco, CA",213,148,258,1.0,4/8/2017,Waited 20 min to get drink orders. Waited 40mins to actually get drinks... over an hour and still waiting while others around us who got here later already eating....
Magicc T.,"Gardena, CA",50,6,,2.0,4/29/2017,Travis the server did not give me my current change back. My bill was 45.57 i gave him 60.00 he gave 13.00 back instead of 14.43  he came to our table with an attitude upon greetings us. He can keep the 1.43 because he may need it. But i will not bring my business or my money to this place again The food was good. Thanks to the chef. But that guy Travis needs to be retrained or let go.
Janna L.,"Bakersfield, CA",285,1276,928,3.0,3/20/2016,"Service is the pits at the bar - even when not busy. No excuse for that. However, the avocado egg rolls were bomb and they were recommended by the bartender in a rare moment we could speak to him. The woman dining a couple of stools down from us was pissed at how she was being treated/ignored so we know it wasn't just us. The cheesecake would be my last dessert ever if I could choose one - it is so good. When ordering from the counter at the front, be prepared to wait about 20 minutes. You are put in a queue and have to wait until all take out food orders are taken by phone and completed. If I were the owner here, I would have someone just doing cake to-go orders to expedite things and keep people flowing out the door. Recommended are the dulche de leche caramel and Adam's peanut butter and fudge ripple. Thankfully, I do not live near here or I would be here too often/at the gym too often!"
Laine N.,"Newport Beach, CA",0,7,2,1.0,4/1/2017,Gave 1 star because there is no -1 star Want to have food poison come here The place is dark so you don't see the c r a p food you are eating
Ethan W.,"Torrance, CA",65,57,172,1.0,7/1/2017,"Went in today and was told 30 min wait. After one hour, we were still waiting. So, we asked the receptionist how much longer. He said: "" our server is down and it will be another 40 min""  I  am not sure what it means, but I think it is wrong. No announcement about the server down was made and no apology was made. Very unprofessional."
Michael C.,"Torrance, CA",209,44,371,5.0,9/7/2016,"I am a big fan of Ferrero Rocher and Nutella. I was excited to see the Chocolate Hazelnut Crunch as a new offering. I was excited to order it! The verdict? It was hazelnut heaven with the mixture of cheese, chocolate, nutella and the crunchy bits!  The Piña colada was also creamy, flavorful and had a good amount of rum. Enough to feel the kick with one order! The herb-crusted salmon was tender, creamy and tasted healthy with the herbs. The serving size was good. I also appreciate the asparagus and mashed potato as side dishes.  The only downside was that the service speed was longer than normal. However, our server was friendly and made our experience enjoyable!"
Jakeisha G.,"West Covina, CA",155,178,60,3.0,3/3/2017,"I'm Black (You'll see why I say this in a moment) While parking my car, my friends said they were being seated.  When I arrive at the host stand, I alert to two ladies that my friends were recently seated but I'm not sure where.  The manager says, ""I just sat some people, I think they're your friends.""  This lady takes me to a table with 2 black people and then tells me, ""this is the table.""  I looked at her and said, ""I don't know these people.  My friends are not black!""  I was pretty annoyed that this lady assumed I would be meeting other black people.   Anyways, I got past that point and had a nice dinner service with my multicultural group of friends.  Everything went as expected.  Servers were attentive and food was good.  Our orders arrived promptly and at the correct temperature.   Other annoyance was the parking situation.  This restaurant was only offering valet.  I personally like to self-park.  I was able to find metered parking right by the restaurant for $1.50 per hour.  The meters had a slot that looked like it was for a credit card.  I tried to use my credit card but it didn't fit, I guess those meters don't take credit cards.  I didn't have enough change in my wallet to park on the streets so I valeted."
Holly P.,"Torrance, CA",128,5,,1.0,9/8/2017,"My cobb salad tasted bad I looked it was wilted lettuce, my sons fruit was old and discolored. They said they would redo my salad they did minus half the ingredients. The staff was nice but food terrible. We will not return."
Cherish C.,"Hermosa Beach, CA",455,217,528,4.0,3/14/2016,"I don't usually care to write reviews for big chains, but this Cheesecake Factory is legit. Ask to sit on the outside patio if it's a beautiful day!  The service is great, the ambiance can't be beat with plenty of space and located right on the water, and the food and drinks... impressive menu, big portions, consistent flavors (esp important if you are the type that orders the same thing every time), and really tasty. Don't forget to order a slice of cheesecake! TIP: Only eat half of your meal so you can get the yummy dessert =) The slices are HUGE and I generally share with a couple people (and we don't always finish). They have a good sized banquet room and bar upstairs. We almost had our wedding reception here (they can set up your ceremony there too) but it could not accommodate our 200+ guest list. I've been here for a buffet style birthday lunch as well and the party attendees were not disappointed.  The only reason I'm docking is because of the required valet ($4). NOTE-There is metered street parking available now if you would rather save a couple dollars."
Jacqueline M.,"Redondo Beach, CA",136,25,6,5.0,8/15/2017,Skinnylicious menu is awesome. I recommend the steak medallions or the Tuscan chicken which me and my husband split along w the appetizer Caesar salad. Always consistently good.
Darwin H.,"Victorville, CA",94,29,8,3.0,5/6/2017,"So, I was expecting so much more being by the ocean, but it turned out to be just an ""average"" restaurant. Nothing stood out, nothing over the top. Truly not impressed. The service was good for as busy as it was, our waitress and waiter turned out to be pretty good which is what made the difference. Even though she had to take her lunch break, she left us in good hands.  It seemed to be a super busy night, lots of people, 2.5 hour wait (unless you sit in the bar), and this was Saturday evening. Probably could have found something better. So this Cheesecake Factory isn't bad, but certainly not the best. Good thing they have great waitstaff!!! They make the difference..."
Mo M.,"Torrance, CA",51,209,720,2.0,8/14/2016,"So far...sad  Birthday dinner  for the wife. Seating us in the corner in the back. Not a busy night up front but for some reason we sit in the boondocks.  Dirty table and the cushions covered in food. Looked like someone wasn't wiping down properly,  just pushed the food off the table onto the seats and floor.  Bang Bang chicken- Dry dry chicken. Wife sent it back for a chicken Parm sandwich which Was decent but not something she really wanted. Just played it safe with the usual which is the sandwich.  Jamaican Black Shrimp- good. Saucy. A little kick. Good plate here.  Drinks. Two Sodas. Refilled once.  Dessert. Black Out Cake- Good any day.  Waiter was all over the place. The poor guy was very tired. He had taken over for the original who first saw us when we seated but then had to go since his shift was over. So this new guy took over and he apologized to  us and the two tables beside us for his lack of service, but he said he was overwhelmed by to many tables he already has at the same time. So it became a waiting game for anything after the drinks. The waiter was sweating tired I saw his face giving up. I really wanted to help him. So I never asked for anything more. We just waited to catch him in a breather and then I'd ask.  To cut it short. This waiter was obviously over worked. Someone should have helped him. But no one did. Where is the supervisor?  Besides that. It was a mediocre dinner."
Vinay Y.,"Torrance, CA",21,190,89,4.0,9/16/2017,This is a nice Cheesecake factory location that is not too crowded (unlike most others I have been to) and they have mandatory valet parking for $4. It's in a nice location next to the marina with nice views. The staff is very nice and friendly. Would come here again.
Ann D.,"Redondo Beach, CA",0,3,,5.0,12/12/2017,Our women's golf group had our holiday luncheon yesterday for 70 people. The food and service was outstanding. The committee got lots of compliments. Thanks Cheesecake Factory.
FRANCHESCA L.,"Torrance, CA",0,14,10,5.0,4/4/2017,"Our little set up for a joint baby shower lunch.  Thank you to our wonderful Sierra for being patient with the arrival of our guest and a huge thank you to the host at the front (forgot to get his name), he gave our two guest of honor their baby shower pins before arriving at our table.  I would recommend if you're going to have gifts at your table reserve for 1 or 2 more than who's coming.  Just so you have more room.  It was my first time there so I didn't know better but we had a lovely time. Thank you staff at Redondo Beach Cheesecake Factory!  You must try the avocado rolls!"
Pegah Y.,"Washington, DC",1447,2359,6598,5.0,8/2/2016,"My husband and I loved this Cheesecake Factory location when we visited back in March after we had finished viewing our wedding venue (just 5 minutes away in Redondo Beach).  We were hungry between appointments so we stopped by for some appetizers!  I ordered the ahi tuna appetizer, while my fiance (now husband) ordered some fish tacos. We also ordered some drinks - the mojito and margarita were excellent.  Very delicious!  And we had an awesome view of the water in Redondo Beach :)  In fact, we were seated by a window overlooking the marina.  Service was excellent, parking was ample, and we had a fantastic experience all around!"
Darryl M.,"Yabucoa, Puerto Rico",437,33,608,4.0,1/9/2017,"My daughter and I  Couldn't resist valet parking elegant hip waitstaff food reasonably priced, fresh ingredients, so many choices whatever ur craving vary have a continental menu.. But the cheese cakes are so good don't leave with out one to go!  Aloha Chef D'"
Brad L.,"Compton, CA",186,221,239,4.0,4/15/2016,"Though they tend to overbrown the bread on my girlfriend's Cuban sandwich, everything else is fantastic, especially the cheesecake.   Not crazy about mandatory valet parking ($4), either.  We have a wheelchair tag, but those spots are almost always full."
Ivette M.,"Rancho Palos Verdes, CA",75,10,3,1.0,7/17/2017,What happened to this restaurant? We used to love the food here. Stopped by for happy hour. Retiring the cocktails as both were sugar bombs. Chicken sliders looked great but tasted like used oil. Yuck! The Vietnamese summer rolls used to be great. Our order of tools was mainly noodles in a wrapper. Total bummer!
