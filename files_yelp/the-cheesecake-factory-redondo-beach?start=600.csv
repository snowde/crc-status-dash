Amanda L.,"Lawndale, CA",84,154,295,5.0,2/23/2014,Can never go wrong with going here. Awesome food and customer service!
Taylor C.,"Long Beach, CA",0,17,4,3.0,1/26/2014,"Came here for my 21st birthday, and was kind of upset about the hostess people. We came in and we knew it was gonna be a while till we got seated. We asked for a seat outside by the water, my boyfriend wanted to make it nice. We waited for about 35min. And our buzzer went off. We brought it to the hostess who said she didn't have a seat outside but had a booth inside. I was kind of upset that we waited all that time and didn't get what we wanted and if we did want to sit outside it would be another 30min. But over all our waiter was attentive and our food was good."
Melisa M.,"Las Vegas, NV",133,40,50,4.0,5/29/2014,"My bf and I were craving some good cheesecake so I headed down to pick some up to go. It was a Tuesday night so I thought they would not be to busy. Boy was I wrong. Luckily they do have a spot for 10 minute parking if you tell the valet that you are just picking it up to go.  The cheesecake was delicious as always, although $17 for 2 slices of cheesecake seemed a bit steep. I have had cheesecake at Junior's in NYC and it was not that expensive and in my opinion it tasted better, but for the south bay this was very good.  I went with a classic cheesecake with strawberries which was delicious and my bf had the chocolate raspberry truffle which he said was ""Nom nom nom"" so two thumbs up there.   If you are having a craving for good cheesecake this is a great place to go."
Agustin R.,"San Pedro, CA",24,28,12,5.0,8/21/2013,Been going there with my friend Yanira. What brings us back is the full menu with so manny choices. So far the food is   excellent and I haven't been disappointed yet. And not to mention the cheese cakes  are the cherry topper. Just remember save  room for desert !!! Oh almost forgot to mention the ocean view it gives it that finishing touch to your dining experience
Christa H.,"Lakewood, CA",0,3,,2.0,9/11/2013,"My review is on the service. I went there to celecbrate my father's birthday. When I arrived I told the host that I have a total of 8 people in my party but 2 of them won't be arriving until late. The guy told us that we could not sit down until at least half of our party was there. 3 of us were there. I informed his this was a bit of a 'surprise birthday' party and I would like to be seated so when the guest of honor arrived he would see us at the table already. So do you know what they offered to do. They offered to put my balloons down at the table but we could not sit down at the table until someone showed. How STUPID is that. Once again I explained that 2 people in our party would not be arriving until later so technically half of my party is here. NOPE...they made us wait until the guest of honor showed up and saw us in the lobby. But don't fret, the BALLOONS were sitting at the table.  Then we had a flighty waitress that we could never find. Had to ask about 3 other servers for assistance. This is the problem when you go out with large groups and they automatically charge gratuity. But guess what...YOU DON'T HAVE TO PAY THE GRATUITY. You did not sign any contract that states that you will pay, all you have to pay is the bill. My attorney informed me of that.  Nothing bad to say about the food, but definitely will not be visiting this place again. I like excellent service and this place doesn't have it."
India W.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,22,1,3.0,7/13/2015,"Came here on July 10th to celebrate my boyfriends birthday, with another couple. It was a busy night but we were still seated within a very quick time. The service received was EHH, I've had better service elsewhere. Our server Scarlett wasn't very friendly, I've been here on different occasions and have gotten over the top service but this time not so much. Our food was outstanding like always, never a complaint there. Like I stated it was my boyfriends birthday so when coming in to be seated I had already told the hostess that we were celebrating my boyfriends' birthday so I was very stunned when after we had ate our food, Scarlett had came with the check, didn't offers and dessert choices, nor did any one come sing Happy Birthday to him, there were several other birthdays being celebrated because I heard at least 3 while we eating. not to mention she threw my friends food away because she didn't hear ask for a to go box, so we had to wait for that to be made over."
Manuel R.,"South East LA, Los Angeles, CA",0,7,,4.0,6/14/2015,Always great food and service with a great view of the king harbor marina and at night of that view of lights from the marina makes for a great view!
Meghan M.,"Lawndale, CA",2,55,,1.0,3/7/2013,"Last dinner I had I ordered the BBQ ranch chicken salad. Spent the greater part of the night and the next day on an I.V. from food poisoning. Called and told the manager that I had to miss work and to check the cleanliness and food practices. Of course she suggested it was from something else I ate, which was a PB&J packed work lunch from home, and wasn't empathetic at all. After being on the phone for two minutes she asked for my address. I gave it to her. Guess what showed up in the mail? NOTHING. Just a tactic to shut me up and get me off the phone. Shame."
Sally A.,"Manhattan Beach, CA",105,264,74,3.0,6/23/2012,"I like to sit outside at this restaurant.  The setting is very nice with the view of the marina.  This location is very popular for large family celebrations which mostly take place in the indoor dining room.   We always order the same thing (here or at any Cheesecake Factory) - Factory nachos to share, California Cheesesteak sandwich for my fiance, and the Tuna Tataki salad for me.  The Factory nachos are hit or miss and can sometimes be overcooked, but when they're good I enjoy them.  My fiance hates peppers so he asks for his sandwich without them, but there are almost always peppers anyway when he gets his meal, so he has to pick them off and deal with the taste of pepper residue on his sandwich.  Sort of annoying because he's never unclear and 9 times out of 10 they get it wrong.  The Tuna Tataki salad is really delicious and light.  If I ever deviate from it, I don't like my food, so I've stopped trying to experiment. We never valet park.  You can usually get a spot at one of the meters right across the street and then walk over."
Karina G.,"San Pedro, CA",14,31,24,5.0,2/13/2014,"Went with my bf for our date night on a random Friday night at 11pm. We didn't know where we wanted to go or what we wanted to do so we just drove, then he for the idea to go here luckily the Cheesecake Factory is open until 12:30am omg who would've known that!! Perfect!! We got to the restaurant at about 11:30 service was great, food was great. The drinks were so good, we come occasionally but now we know we can come late too haha"
Jay Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,41,37,4.0,6/6/2012,"Went in today for the GF's 21st bday:) Michael M was our server. Was very polite, attentive but knocked off 1 star off his service because we had to ask the busboy for bread lol... Overall it was a great experience. I had the mac nut cheesecake at the end and the GF had te red velvet cheesecake. If you like ahi tuna, get the wasabi crusted ahi with brown rice! yum yun yum yum yum sooooo goood!!! You get what u pay for. great food, great quality, great service!"
L B.,"Vista, San Diego, CA",15,21,,5.0,8/3/2013,This review is for the banquets dept. I got married here and had a wonderful day. Ask for Jackie. She made sure everything was perfect. The staff was great. They even started moving furniture out of the way when the conga line got too big!
Maricar R.,"Hawthorne, CA",0,12,6,4.0,12/17/2012,"This restaurant is my favorite... We recently went there for my oldest daughter's birthday and we were seated right away.. Our server was FANTASTIC, she was able to split the dessert for two for both my girls and they loved it...  I recommended this place to my boss for our annual Christmas party and he made the right choice.. My colleagues and I had a BLAST!!!!! The only problem we had is when we called to make a reservation they told us that we couldn't make a reservation after 5pm but when we got there, we find out that we could have made a reservation. This would have avoided having to wait about 30 minutes for our table,but we still had a great time!!!"
Sander B.,"Tenderloin, San Francisco, CA",0,5,,5.0,7/29/2014,"Very good quality food at a very reasonable price. Portions are huge too, I wonder if people have room for the cheesecake afterwards, cheesecake that's even more delicious. Absolute must to have dinner at this pleasant restaurant"
Ladycamelot C.,"West Hills, CA",0,12,,1.0,6/29/2014,The service was good however the food was dried out and overly salted.  Disappointed over the preparation on some of our dishes.
Eric C.,"Berkeley, CA",65,330,5,4.0,8/29/2011,"This Cheesecake Factory has special memories for me. I've come here countless times, with friends and family. One of my good friends had his post-wedding reception here! I've never been disappointed with the food here. Come here during peak dinner hours and you'll be waiting a while.  Favorites: spinach & artichoke dip, almost anything with angel hair pasta, Chinese chicken salad, and the black bread that they serve.  Other memorable experiences: waiting 45 minutes for food only to be told that our waitress went on break and didn't put the order in (meal was comped), and leaving my credit card here only to realize it the next morning (after taking a red-eye flight to Philly)."
Phil T.,"Orange, CA",177,701,610,2.0,5/25/2012,You know what really pisses me off about this location? The parking. They have this giant lot for valet parking and off to the side is a small lot of about 15 spaces if you want to self park. I came here for lunch and of course the small lot is packed and valet or the street was the only option. I parked valet but told them I would park it myself. Not going to give them a tip for extorting customers to use their valet services. I don't care if the valet is only $2.50. It is totally forced on you to pay to park.  Never mind how the food or service was. That's probably the only thing that keeps me from giving this place one star. Will never come back here. screw cheesecake factory.
Hector R.,"Stevenson Ranch, CA",34,80,,5.0,5/28/2015,"Very high quality food, everything made from scratch, and very efficient at what they do.  They are a model for casual dining.  They also use very good coffee."
H L.,"Fullerton, CA",0,25,,1.0,1/19/2015,"I would never come back. This location was recommended by a wedding planner as a potential reception site. Oh my God! I would rather eat fried chicken out of a bucket on a park bench than eat here for my wedding. You would think that beiing on the water that it would be classy with amazing views, right??? Nope. It feels like a casino and is super loud inside.mway too big and very tight tables. My boyfriend and I only ate half of our appetizer and then left. We were starving but that place was a nightmare. I would give it zero stars if possible."
Chris H.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,24,,5.0,7/19/2015,"I've had to go to fancy business dinners all over L.A., but I have to be honest...I enjoy the food at cheesecake factory more than any of them! I LOVE the four cheese pasta and the strawberry shortcake (ask for fresh strawberries instead of the marinated ones), as well as a dozen other meals on their menu. Healthy or unhealthy, the choice is yours. The valet parking should be abandoned, but now there are meters on the street if you don't want some stranger driving your beloved car."
