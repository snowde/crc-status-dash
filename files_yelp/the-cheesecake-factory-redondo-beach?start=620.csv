Michelle B.,"Las Vegas, NV",20,144,120,3.0,3/2/2014,The cheese cake factory has turned into a hang out spot. Not as classy & the cheese cake isn't tasty to me. I would go to socialize if I was into that type of crowd. The food is okay. Not something I would crave
Alexander B.,"Los Angeles, CA",143,13,1,4.0,7/24/2014,This is definitely one of the better Cheesecake Factories I've been to in the past. The portions are extremely generous and the food tends to be consistent. I had the Cobb salad and I was pretty happy with it. The table bread is extremely delicious but the view is what really brings people to this location. It's located along the marina and so I recommend sitting outside.
Rain W.,"Los Angeles, CA",64,257,72,3.0,5/11/2014,"I would give it a 3.5 actually.  The valet parking seems unnecessary  but I was glad there was a self parking spot off to the side. The food was good. I had a cheese burger with a salad and was able to accommodate my gluten issue . My friend had the fish tacos and they were nice enough to split the order to have two of each type, tempura and grilled. He had the bread and it was nice and fresh. Would come again just not during the mad rush hours."
Vlad P.,"Berkeley, CA",8,90,3,4.0,10/10/2011,"Ambiance: I sat in the patio and it was quite pleasant to see the boats through the transparent glass fence and have the sun shine above. Service: Waiters were very helpful and accommodating. The put up with us switching tables due to some noisy kids at the neighboring table.  Food: I had a roasted mushrooms on salad leafs. Pretty tasty. It's a small plate and it would have been enough for me. But the waiter suggested I get something else as well, which turned out not be necessary. I do prefer small portions so I won't hold it against her. Drinks: Caramel macchiato was not bad at all. A little on the sweet side which made it ok to share with my sweet drink loving wife."
Yuri R.,"Long Beach, CA",7,6,1,5.0,4/18/2014,"Love this place! The white chocolate cheesecake is my favorite. Love the food, great service and good drinks! :)"
Ian S.,"Hermosa Beach, CA",40,365,142,4.0,2/15/2012,"Came for dinner and a couple drinks. The food was great, and the service was friendly. I don't think I've come to expect any less from the Cheesecake Factory, regardless of which one I visit.  I had the combo with Chicken Madeira, and Herb Crusted Salmon. The menu made it appear as though it only came with mashed potatoes, so I ordered sauteed spinach with it because I also wanted veggies. It ended up coming with asparagus as well. I was pleasantly suprised, but it would be helpful if that was stated on the menu. The setting was nice. It was near the marina, but you couldn't really see it from where we were sat.  One thing I found kind of dumb was the valet. The parking lot was big enough to accomodate all of the cars. And it wasn't a slow night, it was Valentines Day. It didn't cost much, only $3.50. But it just seems pointless when I could walk to my car faster than the amount of time it took to wait for a parker to fetch my vehicle. Other than that... Positive experience."
Keila H.,"San Pedro, Los Angeles, CA",237,204,41,3.0,3/5/2012,"This is just like all of the others except a nice location.  I have yet to sit in the actual dining area as I just prefer to sit in the bar. Went for lunch the other day and was actually really surprised at how good it was.  Had the potstickers, the BLT salad and the fried chicken sliders.  All were great but the sliders were A-Mazing.  Very reminiscent of chick-fil-a.. As far as the parking goes - they kinda force you into valet but its only $2.50.  I thought I would be smart and park at a meter right  across the street.  To my dismay I came out to a $45 expired parking meter ticket.  Next time ill just let the dudes park my darn car."
Bob B.,"Trabuco Canyon, CA",0,6,,4.0,1/12/2014,"Went to have lunch yesterday and came away very impressed. It is obvious there is attention placed on customer service. From being spoken to while being seated to constant inquiries on the experience, I felt like I was special.  Special Kudos to Sid our server. He was excellent. We all enjoyed the food and the care. Thanks!"
Eileen W.,"Mountain View, CA",3,14,,4.0,1/8/2014,"Went here with a wonderful couple I know.  One of my dining partners and I had the chicken piccata, and it was excellent, which surprised me. The other diner raved about the salmon. The servings are enormous; I've been here several times but could never order a dessert due to the size of the entries. Was seated next to this pathetic couple. The man was having a one-on-one conversation with his Bluetooth and the women was captivated by her smart phone, but that's not the restaurant's fault."
Larry S.,"Torrance, CA",0,56,1,4.0,1/7/2014,"The location is great - Waterfront (marina), and the outdoor patio is huge.  Actually the restaurant itself is large. We came on a Sunday afternoon and sat outside.  Our server was pleasant, but a little slow and seemed distracted. The Kobe burger was cooked to order, but the sweet potato fries were lacking (cold and unseasoned).  GF had the Pulled pork sandwich and it was pretty good. We split a slice of white chocolate caramel macadamia nut cheesecake.  On a scale of 1-5, it was a 7. All in all, a nice Sunday afternoon."
Nick G.,"Portugal Cove-St. Philip's, Canada",1,5,,4.0,6/23/2014,"I'll keep this one simple. AMAZING food, great server (Megan P, I believe). Only real downside is that parking is valet-only."
Jeannie L.,"Redondo Beach, CA",181,308,368,4.0,11/21/2013,"i love cheese cake factory.  I have been to a lot of different locations of cheesecake factory but i have to say that this location is my favorite.  It is located near the beach so you can enjoy the beautiful water view.  They have valet but I am not a big fan of valet especially paying $4.  Don't worry: there are plenty of street party right across the street.  It doesn't take credit card, so you just need to make sure you have enough coins though.   I think the foods were as good as other cheesecake factory stores.  and of course, you cannot miss their cheesecake!  The only complaint I have is that the waiter who served our table was very rude and I did not like his service at all.  I ordered miso salmon, one of my favorite dish at cheesecake factory, but it didn't come out even 10 minutes after everyone's orders come out.  We asked him about my order, and he just answered in a very rude tone ""It's coming!""  Few minutes later, one of managers came and apologized to us that the fish was burnt so they are re-doing it.  Since it took a long time, couple managers stopped by to apologize.  I am usually not too picky about the services but I do expect that waiter would have told us the same thing as managers did when we asked.  The manager complemented us by not charging us on miso salmon and a cheesecake that we ordered without us asking.  I really wanted to leave more tips for managers' services but since managers don't get to keep the tip, we did not leave as much as we would normally do to the waiter.  I appreciate their efforts to keep us satisfied with our experience there.  However, maybe they should keep closer eyes on their staff for service. Food: 4 stars Ambience: 5 stars Service: 4 stars Overall: 4 stars"
Kelly W.,"Orange, CA",87,28,,2.0,4/26/2015,"This place used to be consistent, now it's a bit... unpredictable. We got there at 1000 on a Sunday, opening time. We were seated immediately, but at the very back of the restaurant, by the servery area- where the waiters ring up stuff, get extra utensils, etc. Not wanting to sit there, we asked to move outside. Again, she sat us at the very back, near the outside servery- swinging doors, kitchen noise all over again. And only one seat facing the water.The entire patio area was empty.  Our waiter arrived, and we asked to move again. he finally said, 'sit anywhere you wish'. So we picked a table in the middle of the patio, where it was quiet and we both had a nice view of the water. One of the servers (not our waiter) had an enormous amount of perfume on, which killed my appetite every time she walked by. Other than the seating arrangements and the heavy perfume, our waiter was stellar and the lemon ricotta pancakes were absolutely perfect. Still puzzled as to the seating choices when the entire place was empty. The next party she sat was right next to our table.......  with 15 other tables to choose from."
Rebecca L.,"Arcadia, CA",224,178,30,5.0,1/12/2012,My kitchen away from home!! I particularly love this location because its in my neighborhood! I feel like home when I am there. The staff is all really nice.My favorite dish would have to be the cashew chicken lol. SOOO good or the sweet corn tamale cakes!!!!!
Laurie D.,"Torrance, CA",268,132,122,4.0,11/3/2011,"I have been coming to this location for years and have expierenced some great meal and some not so great ones. The great superceding the not so. I believe the only few times I had crap for service was when I ordered a salad dry and it came with everything on it and a verbal argument broke out as to what I said. Asking him to get his manager changed the situation and they took it off the bill (I just wanted a dry salad). The other time was when I had mold on my bagel and they tried to tell me to cut that part off. ""Oh Manager!,"" I said and that was comped and changed to something totaly different. Enough with the bad vibes. They have a great bar and you can order the entire menu there if you don't want to wait and a space is open. They have a ""skinny"" drink menu. Not sure you can get burboun any skinnier. But the drinks looked fun. When they are busy expect to wait or else go on off peak hours. The food is always good quality and you certainly get enough you just need to be with people that you enjoy being with and relax because if it's busy things there move at a moderate place. I have been to CKFs all over the state and country so I I'm definitely a fan. Don't get me started on the chesecake  they have many to choose from. What's your flavor?"
Jacly D.,"Santa Monica, CA",0,29,,3.0,12/18/2012,Very good location. Right in front of harbor. I always use this restaurant when i dating with a lady. Food is OK.
Nesha B.,"Hawthorne, CA",259,250,107,5.0,8/4/2013,I love cheesecake factory and not because i like cheesecake I'm actually not a fan of cheesecake but their food menu is soooo delicious especially their salads i like that im a vegetarian and can still enjoy fine dinning. this is my favorite location its on the pier and you see the mini boats. the staff here are super friendly and the service is excellent and prompt.
Adrian R.,"Torrance, CA",422,88,146,5.0,4/19/2011,"Came here for lunch. Dustin was a fabulous server. Had the BBQ chicken salad. And the wife had the sausage pizzetta.  The salad was a bit dry. But the beans, corn, avocado, and onion rings, made up for the lack of adequate dressing.  The pizzetta was amazing!  Fresh riccota cheese and flavorful sausage.  The vanilla bean cheesecake was, as usual, amaaaaaazing. But the slice that was served to us had an obvious thumb print on the edge of the slice. We alerted Dustin, who without complaint took back the thumbed cheesecake. He was apologetic, even though it wasn't his fault. The manager, GRACE, also came out to apologize and comped the cheesecake. Can't complain...!!!"
Kristen K.,"South Gate, CA",17,44,58,5.0,3/5/2014,No matter what cheesecake factory we go to we always have a solid dining experience. We love the small bites menu and we usually have our go to items for entrées. We always have a tough time figuring out what cheesecake we want but the servers are very knowledgeable about the entire menu and can give you a sense of what each item tastes like. The service is always fantastic and tonight we enjoyed Lindsey S. We were invited to do a survey which we completed but forgot to mention her name. Her service was so fantastic and completely made us enjoy our experience and I had to give a shout out. Love the waterfront dining and will definitely be back.
Andrew H.,"Layton, UT",72,145,29,3.0,7/22/2011,"The Cheesecake Factory was a place that my coworkers wanted to go and eat at as they had great things to say about it.  We had a small group go here for dinner which was OK.  Valet parking is required to eat here it seems. I ordered a calamari appetizer which was OK as it did not come with any really good sauces but it was a decent size and was average.  My coworkers fish and meals seemed pretty decent but nothing special.  I ordered the Jamaican shrimp which had a nice sauce, fried plantains, mango salsa, and some rice and black beans.  I would suggest that you order it without cilantro as it ruined the meal.  If they only put a little cilantro on it the meal would have been OK, but my meal was ruined by the over use of it.  The mango salsa was good with the minute amount I received.  I got to try some Mahi-Mahi which was pretty good, but the meals are so big that dessert was not an option.  Next time I come here I will have to try a piece of the cheesecake. Overall a 3 star place that is OK to eat at."
