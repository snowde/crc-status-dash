Stephanie W.,"Long Beach, CA",23,5,10,1.0,3/17/2014,The service was absolutely horrible.  I've never had such horrible service. They apparently worked there poor server over 12 hours they make you without for your food even though it was a big party the service appeared as if they were not equipped to handle.
Alisha N.,"Valencia, CA",159,21,16,5.0,11/3/2013,"I love cheesecake factory! Never been to this location before. We got seated right away and our server was very attentive. We ordered the Avocado Egg Rolls which never disappoint! Sooo good! I ordered the Santa Fe Salad. Yummers! My boyfriend got the spicy pasta.. I cant remember the exact name, but it was the main pasta dish that was spicy. He is all about spicy so he said it could have been spicier at first; but then said once he got to the bottom it was spicier. ( i told him he should've tossed it first ) To me it was still very good when I tasted it! We ended the meal with 2 cheesecakes to go because we were both so full! The view of the harbor was also very nice to see as well! def recommend this cheesecake!"
Robert E.,"Torrance, CA",7,11,,3.0,3/8/2014,"Was packed even at 2:30 on a Sat. afternoon, however, only had to wait 5 minutes for a table. Food was good as usual, service was so-so. Took quite a while to get our food after ordering. The worst part of Cheesecake Factory is the noise level. It is very loud and hard to have any kind of conversation"
Dave M.,"Redondo Beach, CA",712,102,115,5.0,6/14/2012,"Always good, I love the cheesecake factory! I'm a regular customer and just come here for special occasions/celebrations/etc."
Anna S.,"La Mirada, CA",344,872,131,3.0,6/28/2011,"I have always hearted Cheesecake factory since the first time I came here in either Jr High or High school. I love their food, anything from pasta to main course, appetizers (especially the avocado eggrolls!), mixed or blended drinks, and their desserts (particularly their plain or banana cream cheesecake and their Tiramisu).  This place though has the worst parking and the longest wait during the evenings and other peak hours... which gives it 3 stars. I do like that they are open late though! Service here is mixed, not stand out, but not necessarily horrible either."
Steven R.,"Hawthorne, CA",3,28,12,5.0,3/17/2015,"I'm late on writing this review but hey, better late than never. I was here on Saturday around 5 with my brother and dad. Was pretty busy but it was an amazing day outside so that's understandable. This was my first time here and it was AMAZING lol. I had the smokehouse BBQ burger with extra onion rings, my dad had the chicken and biscuit and my brother had something called Bang Bang Chicken n Shrimp. Now I love hamburger's just like almost everyone else but man, that had my taste buds smiling like crazy. Flavorful, just the way I ordered it (medium), bacon was great and those onion rings lol yea they were perfect. My brother and dad said the same about their food but I literally left my plate clean. The service was just as amazing, friendly staff, helpful and even though it was busy everyone kept calm and were communicating with each other the way it should be. I'll definitely be coming back."
Cassandra F.,"Palos Verdes Peninsula, CA",7,12,8,4.0,3/15/2015,"good view of the marina. the food is so so... I mostly go here for the cheesecake. my favorite is the banana cream! for dinner the pasta is pretty good. great place for dessert, so-so place for dinner"
Henry Y.,"Carson, CA",99,141,60,5.0,8/21/2013,"""Come all those who are toiling and weighed down, and they will refresh you!"" This experience was magnificent!!! Where do I start??? The first paragraph will be a bit of background, for those of you who just want to get to the review then please skip to the second paragraph. For quite some time now  my Grandfather has been battling cancer and recently was in horrible condition. On the day  we went to visit this Cheesecake Factory location, my Grandfather had taken his last breaths earlier in the morning. My mother in a despondent state left work early, as my sister and I took her out for lunch to support and talk to her about our loss. We've recently just had his funeral in the city and state of Indianapolis, Indiana so please excuse the tardiness of this review, there has been a lot going on.             This place was very welcoming and our server was very nice. He gave us great attention, and answered all of our questions as many as there were. We would say ""I have a question"" and his reply was ""I have an answer!"" with a smile on his face. When our food arrived we were one plate short, wouldn't you know it, it was my mothers. Our server apologize, and then another server came over and apologize. The second server came with his chin up and said "" I don't know what (the first servers name) told you but it was completely my fault, I accidentally took his order and gave it to another customer. Once again I don't now what he told you but I take responsibility for my own mistakes. Is there anything I can do to make this situation right?"" With a bit of hesitation my mother asked for a slice of cheese cake. He said ""no problem I'll bring it right over."" The manager then comes over and inquires if everything is alright. At this time it was ""shock and aw"" the level of service provided. We spoke with her regarding the incident, and she added to the complete comfort and peace that we previously received from the two servers.               We enjoyed the rest of our delicious food and the cheese cake was brought out to my mother with excellent presentation. The manager came over one last time to make sure all was well and we thanked her for her loving-kindness and hospitality.                Although small, gestures like these make the big difference. My mother came in feeling horrible, and although time heals all, the excellent staff at the Cheese Cake Factory (having no idea of her mental state), definitely is credited for her initial upswing leading to emotional recovery."
Dani I.,"Compton, CA",6,25,2,5.0,4/1/2015,came here with an old friend to catch up a few months ago. food was so good. our server kento made everything better! this location is awesome!
Tilly D.,"Belfast, United Kingdom",27,187,19,5.0,8/25/2011,"oink oink oink!!! Wow. That's all I have to say. The most amazing view of the ocean and marina with Cheesecakes to die for and the most delicious smoothies in the world. I'm a huge fan and highly recommend the Cheesecake factory. The service was quick and very friendly, but the food was the star of the show. Raspberry and white chocolate cheesecake, how bad could that be?! Ample parking, views, service, gorgeous food and not over priced."
Linds B.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,71,4,2.0,1/17/2012,I am just striking out this week on my dining choices. No more insanity and starting back tomorrow to dining in my kitchen.  I was craving their lunch special. I have not had it for such a long time.  The bread was as good as I remembered. But the salad was lacking everything but the lettuce. I remember it used to be filled with goodness. nothing now.  Pizza was just bland. I know it is not a pizza place.  But I just used to have such good memories of this lunch. And it is no longer a good memory.  One thing that irked me is I saw online that there was valet parking or self parking. I was not given the opportunity to self park. I also did not ask.  Service was good.
Sal C.,"Torrance, Los Angeles, CA",79,49,22,4.0,11/8/2013,"Food is so good, I love the complimentary sourdough and wheat bread that you start with. Overall, this place is delicious and they truly care about their customers. Cheesecake for dessert is always good as well!"
Michelle T.,"Torrance, CA",1662,1003,4594,4.0,9/12/2010,i couldn't stay away...
Tara K.,"Carmel, IN",167,462,5,4.0,10/7/2011,"I always enjoy coming here - probably because it's super gluttonous and I don't even try to rein it in. Some of my favorites are the Shishito Peppers, Ahi Tartare, Avocado Egg Rolls, Hot Spinach and Cheese Dip, 4 Cheese Pasta and Chicken & Biscuits.  You'd think a place with such a large menu wouldn't be able to keep up, but they never disappoint! This particular location is on the harbor with nice views during the day.  Only thing that I would change is to get rid of the valet - this is Redondo Beach, not Beverly Hills!"
Mary G.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,54,,1.0,9/6/2016,"horribleeeeeeeeeeeeeeee service horrible food, i love cheesecake  fac. but this loc and the rest it self bad . the second we walked in the rest yesterday with my kids n husband the hostess had a bad attitute maybe she was tired or god knows what. then it took 45 min to get us seated . then we finally sat keep in mind i have two kids 5 yr old and a 2 in a half yr old . it took them 20 min just to bring our juices and drinks. then another 20 min to bring our bread and another 15 min to bring appetizer. and guess what it took exactly 1:45 minutes to bring our dinner so basically we waited for about 3 hours total . and when they brought the food oh lord my husband had to return it back because he took a bit of his salmon n mashed potatoe and it was soo salty and i ordered chicken marsala and there was bunch of blk pepper on my food . horrible . the only thing was good that my kids eat there mac n cheese and fries . thats why thye got a one star/ because my kids liked there food. oh and to mention the waitress didnt even bother to come by us once to ask how we are doing or if we need refills . so we had to ask other waitresses to refill our cups . just bad . please people save ure money dnt go here go to another cheescake fac"
Elaine B.,"Redondo Beach, CA",11,56,1,5.0,5/5/2013,"I love this place! We have been here several times in the last year and the service, food, drinks and cheesecake are amazing. Consistently amazing. I had to have my baby shower here and it also went off without a hitch! Love this place!"
Pascha S.,"Inglewood, CA",2,20,11,1.0,10/14/2014,"One of the worst experiences I've ever witnessed. On Friday 10/10/14 my husband and myself went to this Cheesecake Factory for dinner. But unfortunately we didn't have a chance to eat.. As we were waiting for our table, we saw a young couple walk in and an employee of the Cheesecake Factory stopped her in her tracks and told her, "" your guest are trying to eat without you. And continued to have a discussion with the young lady. I felt so bad for the lady who's party it was. It appeared that she was giving her husband a surprise party that her husband was unaware of because he said ""your guest, what guest"".  Shortly after this I see the redondo beach police coming up. I overheard the hostess tell them that people are up stairs smoking marijuana. The young lady came down and was talking to the police and she asked them to come up to her party to see for themselves that no one was do no such thing. When the officers came back down. The hostess said well they have the scent of marijuana on there clothes. To me this situation was not handled in a professional manner, the hostess seemed as if she was uncomfortable with the ethnicity group of this party. There was no outrageous behavior from the group up stairs nor did my husband, myself and a few other guest that we there waiting on a table smell any type of contraband being used in the facility. We were actually there long enough to see the party being asked to leave the establishment. The most upsetting thing to us was when we saw a gentleman (African American) and two young ladies being asked to leave also. They were not even a part of the party. They actually had a dinner table themselves. I really hate to say it, but it appeared this party had been racially profiled and discriminated on. During all this commotion my husband and myself missed the calling for our table, which was ok because we refused to dine at an establishment who conducts business this way... My apologies to the young lady who had to endure this hardship on what appeared to be a special day. And to the Cheesecake Factory, you really disappointed a long time patron (myself)!"
Anna L.,"Torrance, CA",14,221,49,4.0,3/25/2013,"the cheesecake factory... always shows up on those diet/health articles as serving the highest calorie dishes in america. but i dont care! i dont eat here everyday so whateverrrrr :))) triple chin status i love their avocado eggrolls, jambalaya, chicken madeira, most of their pastas, salads, etc.. recently i came here for date night with the bf and i noticed they had this new menu with tapas/small plates. i thought that was really interesting.  i ordered the chipotle chicken pasta, and bf had the chicken madeira and steak diane combo. and we had a kale salad to share.  we both enjoyed our dishes, and the kale salad was really good. but my most favorite part of cheesecake factory is, of course, the cheesecake.  my all time favorite dessert in the whole world is cheesecake factory's white chocolate rasberry truffle cheesecake. SOOO GOOD. then end."
Melonie R.,"Los Angeles, CA",28,145,,4.0,2/24/2013,"Had dinner with a friend this week at CCF and was as usual delighted and pleased with the quality of service and food. I ordered the cobb salad. a passion iced tea, and a carmel de leche cheesecake to go. OMG! Everything was awesome which is why CCF is my favorite chain restaurant. You really can't go wrong here with the enormous menu and awesome wait staff."
Kylah G.,"Los Angeles, CA",109,271,170,4.0,3/8/2013,"It's the cheesecake factory what can I say huge calorie busting yummy portions at fair prices overlooking the beach/docks. I love coming here during Sunday brunch and watching people leave in their boats. I have so many favs for food so I'll only name a few.. chicken enchiladas, popcorn shrimp, Salisbury chopped steak, gumbo, chicken costoleta, garlic noodles w/ chicken, chicken cabanara or any of the burgers, sandwiches and salads, their fries and mashed potatoes are great (the portions are ginormous so adopt the sharing is caring attitude and go at it.. my fav deserts are the pineapple upside down cheesecake, the lemon tart, mango keylime cheesecake, and Craig's carrot cake cheese cake. Their drinks are also off the charts good black iced tea, strawberry lemonade/ peach Bellini's, mojito's and margaritas. They have plenty of seating great for parties or one on one... to me the place is nothing fancy just a casual place my family and I frequent often.  Something i forgot to mention is their outstanding service!!!! we come here at minimum once a month and the service has never! never been bad! even when i had a problem with my meal the service was awesome the waitress and the manager went above and beyond to make the problem better and they did!"
