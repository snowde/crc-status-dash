Nicole D.,"Bristol, CT",341,1543,221,4.0,7/18/2013,"I love The Cheesecake Factory and always have, but I didn't have the best experience at this one. We went on a weekend evening and were able to get a seat on the outdoor patio after only a couple minutes of waiting. That was a pleasant surprise, since they don't take reservations. Our service was pretty crappy. Our server was MIA, it took forever for him to bring out bread (even when we asked), and it just didn't seem very professional. The food was good, though, as it almost always is! I liked the outdoor patio here, but was annoyed by the heat lamps... It got chilly once the sun went down and an employee came around to light all the heat lamps. Luckily, I was sitting directly underneath one, so I was nice and toasty. During our meal, though, a woman at a neighboring table asked our server if he could turn off the heat lamp because it was ""such a lovely evening."" Without hesitation, the server turned off the heat lamp - even though I was sitting much closer to it than this other woman, right underneath it, and with a light jacket on - clearly I wasn't hot or uncomfortable. I was really annoyed that I wasn't even asked if I was okay with that decision they made. Anyway... I will always love the CF for the delicious food, epic proportions, humongous menu, and of course the cheesecake. I just hope the next time I go to this location I get a better server! Also, it was valet parking only so we parked across the street at a meter. For some reason, CF seems to be a fancier deal out here than it does on the east coast. People were dressed up!"
Darrell H.,"Los Angeles, CA",11,3,,1.0,2/17/2015,"Horrible service went for a birthday celebration with close to 30 people. Orders where wrong,  service sucked big time. Management needs to do their job and manage."
Melissa A.,"Lake Balboa, Los Angeles, CA",304,97,67,4.0,2/28/2013,"I love Cheesecake Factory to being with, but this is my absolute FAVORITE location! The Patio seating is  wonderful, it's perfect during the day and provides a very imitate setting at night! Their Patio is situate on the harbor, the stunning view consist of docked boats, but you get the fresh ocean breeze and ocean sound.  The times I've gone there, we've only sat outside, the inside part of the restaurant is like any other Cheesecake Factory. It's beautiful during the day, and they provide umbrellas for coverage, on cold days or nights it's still special to sit outside and they have heaters strategically located.  Food there is fresh, delicious, flavorful and the dessert - REMARKABLE!!! I love their Cheesecake! They are so rich and creamy. I love have they have minimum two pages dedicated to all their many cheesecake selections! I have been guilty of skipping my meal to make sure I have room to indulge in a slice of cheesecake! They have a large menu which if you're not exactly sure what you're in the mood for can be a bit overwhelming. I've samples different item, I'm a huge fan of how they prepare their Salmon, their pastas are creamy and they have excellent salads. Their appetizers are just as good and definitely unique, when it's in season my favorite thing to get it the Fire Roasted Artichoke, I highly recommend it. I'm a fan of everything on their menu and as a very picky eater I am rather adventurous with my selections and to this day I haven't been displeased with anything.  This location has Valet parking, it's only $4, I'm not sure if they do allow public parking but for $4 you can't complain. The times I've gone here there hasn't been too long of a wait, I want to say the longest we've ever had to wait was about 10 minutes, but we were with a large party. As far as the service goes, I've received great service, good service and not the best service. The first few time I went was with a large party and the service was remarkable! My boyfriend took me there for dinner, again patio seating and the service was just as remarkable. However, this last time I was there the service was under standards. For a party of 5, our meals did not arrive altogether or relatively close, there was about 5-10 apart which made a big different with the menu it's that should have arrived hot. We constantly had to ask for items, like bread, and other tables that arrived after us had their orders taken before us. That was the first time I've experienced poor service at this location and I've been there about 7 times in the last year."
Huong T.,"Los Angeles, CA",134,96,139,4.0,1/10/2011,"YUMMY CHEESECAKE! I needed an anniversary cake so I ran here and ordered an original 7-inch, which costs $24. They don't write on their cakes, but you can buy a chocolate plaque for $3 and they'll write the message on it for you. They box the plaque separately with sprinkles so you'll be ""decorating"" the cake yourself.  BAD PARKING! If you have trouble finding a spot, they do offer valet parking for about $3 or so. There are about 10 regular parking spots and maybe 2 or 3 take-out spots. That's where I parked and ran in to order a cake. The whole process took a little more than 10 minutes though, but my car was safe and sound!"
Rebecca D.,"Austin, TX",1024,256,413,2.0,7/22/2010,Awesome: - Red Velvet Cheesecake - The view of the harbor Not Awesome: - Manditory valet (cash only) - Watching your drink sit on the bar for 15 minutes before your server notices you're staring at it - Waiting another 5 minutes for your server to actually bring you the drink he discovered you longingly gazing at through the glass Don't turn that dial folks. Round 2 will surely come.
Kyle D.,"Redondo Beach, Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,1.0,5/13/2012,"I had to create a yelp account because I was so dissatisfied with what happened here today, on Mother's Day. To preamble, I am a bartender and I get it... But this was a laugh out loud joke. 1) It took 25 min to get all of our orders to the table (a table of 12)  at the same time. 1/4 of the plates were cold, and 1/4 of the orders weren't correct. Every kind of problem from the wrong toast, a small problem; or an omelette prepared incorrectly, large problem. Three of our dishes had to be remade because they were prepared far too early (according to the server). For a corporate chain who prides themselves on superb service, this was rough, my brother (30) and dad (68) who have a good stress tolerance were 100% hangry.  2) The expo had attitude with my father when he said, ""this isn't what I ordered."" I understand that if a customer is dissatisfied and it's not your direct fault you still should not snap back. 3) The restaurant was at 1/2 capacity! We had brunch at 9:45 am! Get it together cheesecake! 4) When the disaster became official, 5 expos flooded our table with apologies, correct sides, the extra avocado and piping hot food that was 25 minutes late. No manager showed up, which to me, a bartender was rude. My girlfriend and I chose to eat our food warm-ish because we didn't want to deal with the fiasco at hand (but as before a yelp was needed) The server was a sweetheart and quoted every order that was prepared incorrectly from memory, totally not her fault. The back of the house needs to lock it up and figure it out. The expos should smile more and roll their eyes less. I'm sure the server was glad she could auto-grat the table due to the headache that was my cheesecake experience. Thanks for the Happy Mother's Day! My boss owner of multiple restaurants raves about this place and I was 100% disappointed. I will have a talk with him.    Worst, Cheesecake Chain, Ever... People drive to Marina Del Rey for a better experience."

Soleil D.,"Los Angeles, CA",710,333,82,2.0,6/21/2010,"Fact: -Valet Parking- $3.50 (or was it 4?) CASH ONLY. -Crusted Salmon + Steak Combo= Meh, I've experienced better.  Yeah, that's about it. The Herb Crusted Salmon + Steak Combo...I had expectations. If I'm going to pay $20 bucks for half an order of salmon and steak, it better be decent. Instead, it was overly buttered and seasoned with I believe basil.  The steak...well...they were more like steak nuggets.  Don't sit outside if you plan on eating warm food. By the time I received my order, it was warm but nearing cold.   Lastly, even though their valet is cheaper than the meters & other places, I still hate it.   The only good thing about this place are the banquet rooms. I had an event back in the day and well, it's prettty nice."
Hello K.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,160,3,3.0,4/5/2013,"Over the years this place has gone downhill from what it used to be. The food is just not as tasty as it once was. The service is ridiculous. On my last visit the waitress was trying to hurry us and kept trying to take our bread basket away from us (there was still bread in it!) I had ordered a cobb salad with the blue cheese crumbles on the side. After waiting awhile like usual a different person (not my waitress) brings me a salad and walked away. I notice that it has the blue cheese crumbles mixed in the salad so I have to wait for him to walk by again. So I get his attention and said I ordered it with the blue cheese on the side. He said ""Oh OK i understand"" and takes that salad away. He comes back a third time and hands me a salad that still has the blue cheese crumbles in it but no dressing, he put the dressing on the side. I really don't understand how difficult that could have been but my friend had to start eating her food before I got my correct order because hers would have gotten cold. Even while eating our dinners the waitress kept trying to take our dang bread basket - what the heck was that all about?! I felt like I had to fight for my bread! Then there was the ever so annoying switch of the waitresses because someone is going on break or leaving (who gets the tip from our table anyways?) The chocolate chip cookie dough cheesecake is made with a giant lump of cookie dough in the center of the entire cheesecake. So when you get a slice it's like regular cheesecake with a tiny bit of cookie dough at the end. Lamest cheesecake I have experienced there. They should disperse little cookie dough balls throughout the entire cheesecake mix so you get some in every bite. And this place is just way too noisy to have any kind of conversation and the sun coming through the windows will burn your retinas. I recommend coming here after dark and maybe trying to sit in the bar area if it's less crowded.  Next time I go I might have to keep one hand on my fork and my other hand with my death grip on the bread basket!"
Jerri K.,"Manhattan Beach, CA",0,3,,4.0,2/25/2015,"I keep going back there because I love the food. The service has been terrible there for years. They need to hire more people to accommodate everyone. I frequently have a large party of 8-10 and am always seated by the kitchen- which is noisy and we are always forgotten about in that back room between the patio door to the outside, and the kitchen door. The table sets up against the wall. Don't sit there!  When I leave I look around and see other large parties  seated at great tables. So, I know they exist. I am planning to take a party of 6 out for an early dinner there this Saturday for my son's farewell party as he goes off to the Navy . I sure hope we get it right this time with a nice table on the patio and you can't beat the atmosphere outside next to the Marina. Oh and they don't take reservations. Even the bar tables have lousy service. Waited a long time for drinks and appetizers last summer. J.K."
Shannon W.,"Los Angeles, CA",11,30,5,1.0,8/11/2012,"Apparently the customer is never right even when they mess up your order, it tastes like crap, and the manager comes to talk to you to 'handle' the problem.  Lisa Schmidt is not a good manager, not decent, not even sub-par. She's horrible. She blatantly lies and says she's going to take care of the bad food, that was not eaten btw. After our friend who got the bad food leaves, she comes back with attitude and rudely informs us we're going to take care of her food. The issue is not payment as we can all afford it, the issue is the attitude and personal attacks that she proceeded to issue to my friend who protested her treatment and bad attitude. Our waitress Courtney was great!  Too bad she has a crappy rude boss. None of the 11 of us who were there will ever be back. Great decision in hiring a rude, unprofessional manager. If you want to lose business, keep her!  If you want an easy fix, at minimum train your management!"
Leah P.,"Hayward, CA",3,26,,5.0,2/1/2011,"My go to meal if I'm really really hungry and don't want to be disappointed: Entree: Chicken Piccata Dessert: Tiramisu Cheesecake I miss this place...it has a wonderful location near the marina where boats are docked...I've been to the ones on Santana Row and Pleasanton...food is constantly amazing, but this location tops them all."
Prince B.,"Long Beach, CA",234,154,1457,4.0,10/16/2012,"O.k. I've had my mixed opinions about the whole Cheesecake Factory chain, and I think it's due to a bad experience I had at the one in Pasadena, CA. But at the advise of my wife Michelle, we went to the one in Redondo Beach and it was pretty cool. The service was great and the food was awesome...loving the Gumbo, and my Red Velvet Cheesecake damm that was good. So this one I will recommend if your in Redondo Beach, it was a nice drive for me and I truly enjoyed myself...thanks Babe."
Ming-Jou C.,"Dallas, TX",1070,875,388,4.0,7/2/2008,"I'm surprised I haven't written a review for this location, considering I own stock in the company and have been here a million times. People think this is my favorite place to eat. Just because I suggest it for lunch doesn't mean I love the place - it's just convenient for a large group of indecisive people. There you go. Good food, usually good service, and clean atmosphere. If you sit next to a window, you can look through the dirty water and sometimes see garibaldi swimming around. I don't think I need to talk much about their menu.  Note: You can make reservations for lunch, but not dinner. And they have a couple of private rooms upstairs, in which my company has done events. They do have a great banquets/catering department and they execute events really well. Also, sometimes you can self-park to the right when you pull in to avoid the hideous valet at $2.50 for lunch and I think $4 for dinner? One time they started my car twice, which made that horrible grinding noise, and one time they brought me the wrong car (a crappier one, at that).  It just doesn't get a 5 because there's really nothing unique about it. And I have had slow service experience here before."
Azi S.,"Lake Stevens, WA",18,51,1,5.0,9/1/2013,Had a celebration lunch for my recent promotion at work. Great food and good service.
michelle j.,"Huntington Beach, CA",7,51,,5.0,11/11/2012,"We had a Celebration of Life lunch for my grandfather. We had a party of 70+ and used the upstairs banquet room. The setting is fantastic. The room was set up beautifully. The food was fantastic and plenty! Service was exceptional. Jackie was the coordinator and was so helpful, kind, and took care of everything. I loved working with her. Planning a funeral and celebration with just a few days is really tough. I am so glad I was able to hand this task off to Jackie and have such a great result. Our family had such a great time focusing on the life we were celebration! Thank you Jackie and Cheesecake Factory!"
Kory B.,"Rancho Palos Verdes, CA",59,34,4,1.0,7/26/2013,"Short version: ageist serving staff ruined my dinner by ignoring and refusing to serve us for 40 mins while taking orders from the older couples around us. Long story: Food was average was service was TERRIBLE.  I was appalled by the lack of respect I was shown because of my age.  I am a young man and I have been a server for years and still work in the restaurant industry.  I tip well because I know how stressful this job can be, but treating a customer like I was treated today is never okay.  My friend and I sat in the bar area because the wait was long and we just thought we'd grab drinks and dinner really quick.  We get to the bar and was never greeted by a server and after about 5 mins a lady asked if we had our drink orders taken yet and I told her no, but we'll have 2 waters for the moment (my friend was in the bathroom and I didn't know what she wanted).  We waited close to 40 Minuets before we got any order put in.  This is after trying to flag down the wait staff and also trying to order at the bar, but we weren't allowed to if we weren't drinking at the bar counter.  The male server in the bar section was ASSIGNED to our table because the 2 of them fought over which one had to take us.  He NEVER came over!  I would mad dog him and he would look right at me and walk past me and my friend and take drink and food orders of the newly sat people all around me.  5 parties that had come in after had drinks and apps before my drink order was even put in.  There is no excuse to that.  Finally my friend stood up and went to the female waiter and told her we're still waiting to get helper and she was a bit snippy with us.  I told her we'd been waiting for 40 mins to put in our order and she promptly says ""well you do know this isn't the dining area.""  Seriously?  Yeah that happened.  This point we don't STILL don't have drinks.  Why does it take 40 mins to get our drink order.  That same server dropped off our drinks and offered us a complementary chicken soup because of the wait.  We said yes and thank you.  She never came back to check up on us and the soup never came.  That is just insult to injury.  They brought over a 3rd server and besides refilling water we were the ONLY table she was waiting on.  The other 2 were such big pricks that they had to bring in a 3rd server because they didn't want to deal with the young couple.  We talked to the manager, who turned out to be the lady who brought us water, and we told her how we felt like we were being ignored because of our age.  She kept trying to assure us that wasn't the case and how the guy thought we'd been taken care of and we didn't need anything, but that was obviously a lie.  He has NO place working in the restaurant industry if he thinks a table with menus, waving there hands, staring him down, asking for help, and empty water cups is okay and doesn't need to be helped.  If you get a new table, no matter what, you go over and introduce yourself to let them know you'll be taking over and ask if they need anything.  He never came over to apologize.  The 3rd server was actually very nice to us and was left a decent tip. I will never come back here.  I never cared for this place before, but that has now turned into a deep distaste."
Gregory N.,"Morgan Hill, CA",182,269,,4.0,7/21/2013,"You get what you expect, good, tasty food--I go for the spicier dishes, and unbelievably rich and great cheesecake."
Kyle T.,"Colorado Springs, CO",81,20,4,2.0,9/22/2013,"Just your average, everyday Cheesecake Factory. If you're eating here with all the fresh, local cuisine in the South Bay, you should consider expanding your palette. Service is ok and it is in an ideal location. But if you've ever been to one before, you've already been here."
Christian W.,"Westminster, CA",491,632,35,5.0,4/17/2011,Idk about the entire menu...all I know is that The Chicken Madeira and a Pomegranate Mojito while watching the sailboats float by is magical.
