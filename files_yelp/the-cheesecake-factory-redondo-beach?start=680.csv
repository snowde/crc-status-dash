Michelle B.,"Long Beach, CA",349,350,596,4.0,10/13/2012,"This location is down on the  harbor.  Great views of the water and boats.  I had the chicken madera it was great, two chicken breat with cheese and mushroom sauce served with mushrooms $17.95.  This dish is usually is a great go to meal but today it was a bit salty.  I don't remember cheesecake factory being this pricey.  Valet parking only $3.50.  The staff was very attentive and had great menu suggestions.  I got the banana cream cheesecake which was the  .  You can't come here without a slice of cheesecake."
Rachel R.,"Hermosa Beach, CA",54,73,8,4.0,10/13/2014,"Although this is a chain restaurant, it's one of the best. This location has a spectacular view and has an upper banquet area for renting out for parties. The food is delicious, and the portions are generous, I always take half home with me. The one downside is their menu is huge, making it hard to choose what you want to order. If you are having drinks with friends and don't want to order a huge meal, they have a small plates menu to choose from that is about half or 1/3 the size of their normal appetizer portions. The service is almost always great, even when they are crowded and have a 40 minute wait. If you come towards the end of the night as it slows down, I've found its a little harder to get my server to come to my table and end up waiting a bit. A tip if you are with a small group of 2-3 people and their is a long wait, check the bar, usually their are seats open or seats that open up and you can order the full food menu at the bar. The cheesecake of course is delicious, and I've had almost every item on their cheesecake menu. I would have to recommend the red velvet cheesecake as my all time favorite. This is the best Cheesecake Factory I've been to."
Sheila F.,"Gardena, CA",38,21,2,2.0,8/11/2014,"I was given a 30.00 gift card to The Cheesecake Factory.  In spite of living in the area my whole life, I had never had lunch or dinner at the Redondo location.  On 8-7, I was at a local attraction and decided to call in a ""To Go"" order to take home and share with my family.  I ordered 2 10"" pizzas.  1 order of Onion Rings, and and order of Fish and Fries.  Imagine my shock when it came out to 53.00.  I paid knowing full well that  The Cheesecake Factory was expensive and figuring it would be excellent food.  I couldn't have been more wrong.  It was horrible.  The small amount of Onion Rings we were given tasted great, but it wasn't even a full order.  The fries in the Fish and Chips were wonderful, but the fish stunk so bad, no one could eat it.  It was not fresh at all.  They gave us some cabbage on the side which I think was supposed to be coleslaw.  It was dry, cut up cabbage. The Pizzas were average and we ate them, but were not worth what I was charged for them.  I must say I am totally disappointed, I should have just ordered a cheesecake.    PS.  The Restaurant is lovely and the people I interacted with were polite and gave good service, my issues are with the lunch time meal I was given.  8-12-14  I am updating this review. I wrote to Corporate regarding the trouble I had.  I was just called by a very apologetic manager from The Cheesecake Factory, and she has convinced me to go back so they can try to improve my opinion of them and experience the food and service they are proud of.  I agreed to try again and I will update this review once I have."
Felecia T.,"Downey, CA",0,3,,5.0,1/28/2015,On Sept. 15th 2013 my husband wonderful husband gave my 50th birthday celebration at The Cheesecake Factory in Redondo Beach in a private room and footed the bill and it was AMAZING!! The young man Ash who was in charge of our private party was the absolute best! I usually frequent the Cheesecake Factory in Pasadena or Santa Anita and didn't even know they had private rooms and apparently all of them don't but this one in Redondo Beach does. We had a view of the beach and my guest kept raving about the food. There is also a bar in the private room and our bartender Derek was great as well. I am a stickler on great customer service and it could not have been better! thank you so much Ash for making me feel like a queen for a day! I'm sure we will find a reason to have a private party there again! Thanks again!  Felecia
Jason V.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,28,12,4.0,1/28/2014,The service was not great. My waiter spent more time chatting with other waiters. The food however was good. I had the strawberry shortcake for dessert it was great.
Eddie C.,"Torrance, CA",196,42,,4.0,9/28/2010,"My visit to the Cheescake Factory was very enjoyable. I don't go there often, but when I do I try and enjoy it as much as I can. :) When I went, I asked the hostess for a window seat. The view of the dock, boats and water were wonderful, I got to enjoy the nice ocean view while I was there enjoying a meal. If you've never been there, its really worth trying out (ask for a window seat). The menu has pretty much everything so you can try with whatever cravings you have. I ordered the wild mushroom burger. The food was good and portion is decent, not too big but its fitting so I don't over eat. Overall dinner was nice, but the really good part is when I tried the Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake. That cheesecake is delicious, not too overly sweet, the center was rich and creamy just perfect I think. Its worth trying out. If your not much a chocolate fan, this is something you should try. Hey! its Godiva Chocolate, how can it taste bad. :p Anywho, this place is great! :)  The food, servers, the atmosphere and the view of the harbor was great. Can't complain about anything in there. Only thing I didn't like was the parking that they have. Self parking has very limited spaces, because practically the whole lot is for  valet parking only. I parked across the street with the meter parking, cost me a few quarters, still not bad.  Overall, its a great experience for those who don't go there often, or haven't been there at all."
Bella B.,"San Francisco, CA",364,612,364,1.0,8/2/2008,"Ok so my bf takes me to this place (this was like last yr so sorry for the late post) and from the start I was like ""Grrrrrrrreat"" this place sucked! The server was totally eye ballin me in front of my bf who could not have looked more irritated. As was I. The food was salty and nasty and way too expensive for what it was, nasty! Again, the ENTIRE time I was there the server kept coming by asking me if I wanted anything (a few times without asking my bf if he did - RUDE) and it was just eek...horrid. Never again! P.S. I never did try the damn cheesecake which I hear is good...I mean it is the damn cheesecake factory LOL. Oh well, I will live!"
Jill C.,"Sacramento, CA",15,37,5,5.0,8/20/2013,"Not sure if the food has improved, but I always appreciate a call from the business when I've sent a message to their customer service.  Tonight I received a call from the management at the Redondo location.  After a nice discussion he offered a $50 gift card.  Much appreciated, and honestly, the only way I would have tried Cheesecake Factory again.  Unfortunately, we're back in the heat of Sacramento, so we'll try the one here.... or maybe we'll save it for next time we're in So.Cal!"
Mx T.,"San Pedro, CA",9,198,10,4.0,9/29/2013,"Predictably good. Always get the Tex-Mex egg rolls and this time went with salmon instead of chicken with the Waldorf salad. I received a huge portion of salmon (at least 6-7ounces) perfectly seared on the outside, yet still rare in the center. Sure, it's farm raised, but eating it once every blue moon won't kill me. The key lime cheesecake was horribly sweet. However, the coffee cut the sweetness and I didn't leave a crumb. Our server was efficient but had a strange, angry energy just underneath his 'welcome' smile. I hope he won't be there next summer for my annual lunch."
Marci J.,"Marina del Rey, CA",1134,44,5,3.0,5/22/2013,"Cheesecake Factory always serves too large a portion, thereby encouraging a lot of waste or overeating, sometimes has greasy fried foods, and offers you no option but Valet Parking. These points bring an otherwise happy rating down. I like the variety on their menu and the variety of seating configurations. They always have an outdoor space, and this one has a great view. During the lunch weekday here, it was pleasant and we had a quieter, separate large group table. Today's visit brings my normal mediocre experience at other CF's, to a higher rating for this particular one."
Ricki K.,"La Mirada, CA",0,3,,4.0,12/29/2011,"Sigh. 4 stars for the food. 2 stars for the service.  The food is amazing. The portions are huge huge huge. Prolly too much for one sitting but I love taking leftovers home to finish the next day so I don't mind big portions at all. Think of it as getting your money's worth.  However, this location seems to consistently have bad service and food is always super slow to come. This time I had to wait 40 minutes just for the appetizer.  The server was really slow and inattentive, too. I had to ask him twice to bring us more bread. He never did so I had to ask the hostess. He only refilled our water once. We had to sit and wait with empty cups for him to even stop by. When he did refill it he asked if we wanted a refill. Uh. Yes. We do. We only had one cup so far and we were barely halfway done with dinner.  I've worked in the service business before so I'm not trying to be unsympathetic but seriously. Wow. Come for the food. Hopefully my server was just the rotten egg of the bunch."
Shaun S.,"Torrance, CA",116,158,20,4.0,4/14/2013,love the chicek bruscieta! or however you spell it!!!! this place isn't all that expensive but I wish i made more money so that I could come here every other day! Service is always friendly though it can be kind of slow when they are busy. All in all this is a great spot and I definitely look forward to coming here again.
Stu M.,"Redondo Beach, CA",33,43,21,5.0,6/16/2013,Great service on this Father's Day - Everyone was caring and attentive - The food was excellent - Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes - Stuffed Mushrooms - Excellent!
Jeremy P.,"San Pedro, CA",112,58,,5.0,8/31/2013,I have great food when I come here.  They also catered our wedding and did a really great job!!
Vincent V.,"Redondo Beach, CA",14,157,23,3.0,6/10/2013,"I have been going to the Cheesecake Factory in Redondo for years. The food, drinks, and service are no different than any other location, but the physical location (close to the ocean) and vicinity to my house make it my favorite. Nice place to eat on a sunny day or clear night."
Perci N.,"San Francisco, CA",460,261,36,4.0,3/9/2010,"The typically unfabulous 2000 Calorie per dish entrees: 2 stars. The amazing Firecracker Salmon rolls (with new spicier sauce): +1 star. The great service (hi Grace, hi Taylor Swift-like hostess): +1 star. P.S. Someone tell the owners to stop being so cheap with the mandatory valet parking."
Askia F.,"Redondo Beach, Los Angeles, CA",32,11,24,1.0,4/14/2012,"the worst fu*cken place I have ever been in my life, I took my girl and her mom here and a few friends for their birthday...  The fucken waiter forgot about my order then tried to play like I ordered something special. I ORDERED ALFREDO.. the shit is already mixed!! so basically I wasted half of my day to watch everyone eat while I sat pissed. Watch out for a waiter named Darryl, he has a receding hairline and a some what goat tee.. worst waiter ever!  If I can put zero stars I would"
Mr M.,"McKinney, TX",71,596,45,2.0,6/3/2013,I am rating their wedding food which included some red sauce pasta. That thing was saltier than a saltine cracker. I'm not sure who the chef was on that day and thought it was okay to salt the pasta so much I was dehyrdrated by the time I ate half of it.
rep c.,"Brentwood, CA",3,67,,1.0,4/16/2012,"Pros:  nice interior, good location, good scenery Cons:  what happened??  stale chips, bland dip (soggy and greasy too), oily crab cakes (shaped like balls?), mediocre service, a salad with literally less than 10 small pieces of avocado and about the same amount of chicken. $5 bucks to park my own car and give the key to the valet.   YOU CAN ASK FOR SELF PARKING (they won't offer it). WILL NOT BE RETURNING."
Bryan A.,"Dallas, TX",1,21,1,3.0,7/13/2010,"The Cheesecake Factory is nice because it is near the ocean. There are some pretty nice views in here if you get a good table. My ""apparent awareness"" of this place when I first walked in for dinner was that it was dark and loud. Yep. You should preserve your vocal cords throughout the day so you can use them full strength at dinner. Oh, and people really dress-up at this location. Some to the nines. I ordered the orange chicken and I have to say it might be the best I have ever had. Expensive, yes...but wowzers it was good! I did enjoy the bread. I ordered some margaritas to go with dinner but they were mostly watered down. And not that strong. These will be at the bottom of my ""list."" You are pretty much being forced to valet park when you come here. Plan on a little wait because the valet might just get backed up... Some of my most expensive dinners have occured here...so you will not find me here that often. In this economy...there is so much more I can be doing with my money!"
