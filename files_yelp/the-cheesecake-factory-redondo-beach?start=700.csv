Breanna H.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,29,,5.0,8/14/2013,"i love this cheesecake factory. it can be hard to get in when its super busy, and the valet parking. (valet parking is mandatory!) i THINK its like $4-5.  the service here is always outstanding. i always order passionfruit iced tea and chicken fettuchini.  the complimentary bread is always delicious, and fresh out of the oven."
Carol Y.,"Napa, CA",4,15,9,3.0,5/17/2013,"We went early to avoid the crowd, but service was still minimal. Even the hostess was dismissive. One of us got Linguine Alfredo - boring. Another got Steak Diane, which had a really tasty sauce. I got the Garlic Noodles with shrimp, which gets an ok. The shiitake mushrooms weren't and there could have been more tomatoes and shrimp (5). Took forever to get dessert, but had cheesecake to go - no complaints there. Tried the Mango Key Lime cheesecake for the first time - pretty good. Also had Dulce de Leche which is always yummy."
Ashani C.,"Hawthorne, CA",0,1,,1.0,11/18/2014,This location is the worst location ever!!! I highly recommend the marina del Rey location they have excellent customer service. The redondo location is terrible. Their customer service is horrible the food is terrible (yuck) . That's exactly why I rate them at 1 star.
Michael W.,"Wellington, FL",4,5,,1.0,7/14/2012,"Poor experience in Redondo Beach, CA  It started with the hostess getting my name wrong. Typed in Mile instead of Mike. Not a big deal, but had to include it in my overall experience. We sat down and the waiter took a long time to get to us. When he finally did, he took our drink orders and when we inquired about some bread he said that they ran out an needed to make more. Understandable except that there were other tables who sat after us and they were served bread upon seating. We were told that the last of the bread went to the other table. We would have to wait.  We then ordered main courses and waited appox. 45 minutes until our waiter came over to the table and said that he had to talk to the manager about why our food was taking so long. Nice to get the manager involved when he could have come to us first. He then said that the kids meal was holding up our order. Huh? I've never heard of 2 sliders holding up 3 full sized meals. In any case, a different server came out and gave us 2 of our 4 meals. We didn't want to eat without the other meals arriving, and they should have kept the two in the back until the others were ready. Abiut 10 minutes later, the manager comes over with our other 2 meals. 1 of the other 2 was the wrong order. She got a Chicken Madiera instead of what she ordered, a Chicken Marsala. Again, not terrible as that could be an honest mistake. So we waited for another order to be cooked and in the meantime, my Memphis Burger I had found to be raw when I ordered it medium. I had to send it back and requested a new one. The manager brought the new order of Chicken Marsala and I waited and waited for the new burger to come out. 10 minutes later it finally came out, a piece of cheddar cheese was slapped onto it, not even melted as it should have been. Now I was finally ready to eat. Undercooked again. So I told them to just take it away since I was done trying to get a proper order completed.  Then the waiter came to the table with a new waitress and said that she will take care of us from now on since her wanted to go on a break. What does she do? Left me the check! Nobody asked us if we wanted dessert, which we did. We all wanted a piece of cheesecake since I was in town from Phoenix and this was our vacation so we were going to splurge a bit. We all could notnbelieve that they just wanted us out of there.  ****UPDATE**** Well, it seems as the only person who actually did get their meal correctly, may have contracted food poisoning that evening. Breakfast was eaten at home (pancakes and coffee) and popcorn at the movie theater. Nothing else but dinner (obviously no dessert since we weren't offered), and the symptoms began within about 3 hours after eating dinner. ***************** When I go to Cheesecake Factory, I expect the same service and quality of food at each restaurant I visit. I have never had a bad experience at a Cheesecake Factory before this one. With the type of service I got here, it sits vey poorly with me and my guests and we are not sure if we will visit again any time soon."
albert r.,"Redondo Beach, CA",67,60,8,4.0,1/18/2011,"Love cheesecake factory!  I usually frequent this location the most. Been to others at the grove, americana, arcadia, brea, beverly hills and the redondo location by far is the best.   They have a patio right next to the docks outside, so you get a semi-partial ocean/water view.  if its a warm day/night i highly suggest sitting out at the patio... even on slightly cold nights they have heat torches outside. Menu is expansive and you cant go wrong with any of their items on the menu.  This location does get busy and has valet parking for 3.50.. they have some self park areas but there are only like 3 spaces... ( yes, im serious.. 3 spaces) hint: you can park on the opposing street and walk half a block and just pay meter parking... 25 cents / 15 min."
Chris Y.,"Lawndale, CA",64,282,36,4.0,12/9/2010,"It's always a treat to visit the Cheesecake Factory. This particular location is nice since it's near the ocean & the pier. The decor is very bright & clean. It's usually busy during dinner and the wait time usually deters me from eating here more often. But the select occasions when I have dined here, I've always been pleased with both the food & the service overall. The menu has a large selection of dishes. However, reading the menu is almost like picking up a novel. It can be tricky to read & navigate. (I must remember to bring my bookmark next time) Just like the wait times to be seated, the wait time to get your food after you've placed your order can be a bit long, but they give you some delicious bread & butter to tide you over in the meantime. Portions are usually large. I've never left hungry. The cheesecake is, of course, phenomenal! But the name ""Cheesecake Factory"", you'd expect no less. They have more kinds of a cheesecake than you can shake a stick at. And the slice they bring you is very large. I always feel like I'm about to slip into a diabetic coma after I'm finished. I used to think the prices were expensive, but after taking a look at most decent restaurants these days, Cheesecake Factory is about on par with the rest. Service has always been fantastic. Very courteous and professional. Not always the best when it comes to attentiveness, but it's understandable considering how many people they have to wait on. In addition to their large dining room & patio area, their second story can be accessed by stairway and leads to more private dining halls/sections, complete with a full bar and views of the marina. Perfect for private gathering or company banquet. Parking is done by valet, unless you can find a spot along the street or in the adjacent lots. A visit to the Cheesecake Factory is a treat I always look forward to!"
Karena R.,"Jacksonville, FL",97,269,322,5.0,11/14/2010,"My husband and I are visiting and celebrating our anniversary!! We are cheesecake regulars from home but this one is by far the nicest with decor and by the water that we've experienced. The food was good as usual, service was quick, pricing reasonable!! If we are ever in the area agin we will definitely visit again."
Jolly M.,"Phoenix, AZ",426,481,869,4.0,6/17/2010,I LOVE Cheesecake Factory's Red Velvet Cheesecake! It's AMAZING! I also love their beef skirt steak with mashed potatoes. Comfort food for sure! Delish! 4 stars because I think it's pricey! TIP: Purchase a $25 gift card. For each card you buy there is a special right now that you get a FREE slice of cheesecake. A slice of cheese cake like the Red Velvet Cheesecake is $7.50 a slice! OUCH!. You are dining their anyway. Might as well get the gift card to pay for your meal. I wish I knew of this. They don't promote this offer and I spent way too much there. I hope they reduce on their price in the near future.
Kevin C.,"Pasadena, CA",1839,882,1721,3.0,11/30/2009,"Been to one Cheesecake been to em all right? Well not exactly, I can keep this short. This one is on the beach which is nice. Service was mostly attentive and having to deal with my backwards family I commended them.  Food was just ok for me with nothing to highlight in particular aside from the four orders of guacamole that we sent back because the avocados were not ripe and the stale chips too. Herb crusted salmon was mediocre, I ate it but it was nothing special.  One down side was the waiter recommending another peach drink over the peach belini for Deb and mentioning all the ingredients but failing to mention the Vodka which makes her puke. Fortunately we noticed that detail on the menu before the drink arrived and changed it. This was supposed to be short right??? Well over all just OK for us."
Reni P.,"Los Angeles, CA",42,83,23,4.0,6/15/2012,This place is huge!!! And they have a gorgeous view of the ocean. Typical Cheesecake factory food (they specialize in everything so nothing is exceptional but everyone can find something to eat) and good service. I think our huge group overwhelmed the server a bit but he was pretty friendly and accommodating and even brought someone a sample of the sauce to help them make a decision.
Lydia M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,1.0,11/9/2014,"Went there last night to celebrate a birthday, chose this location because of the view and the last time there with a large party service was Great!! This time not so much.  Once seated our party of 11 was given 1 basket of bread. After 3 requests finally received water. We were told by our server that the order will be taken in order so it can be delivered that way.NOT THE CASE!!! Meals were  delivered in randomly with 2 meals not being delivered.. Then 15 20 minutes later after speaking to a manager the final 2 entrees were delivered but one order meatloaf had to be returned because it was burned so bad you could not eat it. Then of everyone else's food got cold because we were waiting for everyone to have their meal... So needless to say it was not a Happy birthday"
Chelsea T.,"Hawthorne, CA",0,8,,1.0,10/9/2015,"Cheesecake factory has been my favorite place to celebrate birthdays because they song and bring you ice cream.  This location was a little closer to terrible service. It was my little sisters birthday and my mom and I wanted to do something special for her. We drove there and I thought okay Redondo beach ,good location.  We were seated immediately which is rare! Our Server was named Ryan and at first we thought he was friendly. Okay that  was a thought. He failed to cater to us as well as he did to other tables. We told him it was my sisters birthday and he told us the policy was if you buy a cake, they wrote the name in chocolate and sing. If you don't buy a cake, they give you ice cream and sing. Well we didn't buy a cake and bruh no ice cream! So leaving he took forever to give us a bill and take it. I think I might not go back to cheesecake factory. Not worth it. My sister was excited to go and left crying because no one sang her happy birthday there. Thanks cheesecake factory. What a great way to celebrate a birthday!"
Eboni B.,"Palmdale, CA",0,27,16,5.0,7/5/2013,Recently had an event here at th Cheesecake Factory Redondo Beach. The service that Addie and Jackie provided from start to finish was amazing! Our baby shower was perfect and we know that the location played a huge part in that! My family has never tasted French Toast that heavenly and are still wanting more! Thanks to everyone who helped make our day special we can't wait to bring our little one there once she arrives!
Dee D.,"Manhattan Beach, CA",50,104,53,2.0,2/21/2013,I have always been a huge fan of the Cheesecake Factory but I have to say the last few times I have eaten here have been disappointing.  Poor service and the food is just not what it use to be.
Grace P.,"San Francisco, CA",105,106,16,3.0,3/18/2010,"A good 3 stars!  I think Cheesecake Factory is a good place for a big group of people, especially if everyone has different food preferences.   They have a wide selection of food such as Italian, Japanese, American, etc.!  They have amazing cheesecakes.  Maybe they should just be what they call themselves....a cheesecake factory.    I'm not a big fan of their food so I used to come here for dessert.   This place is definitely misleading with their huge portions and beautiful interior decorations.  I'm not saying that is a bad thing, but when it comes to food quality I give them 3 stars."
Shannon R.,"San Pedro, CA",15,82,51,3.0,6/10/2013,"I really love the food at the Cheesecake factory, I like the cheesecake event more than the food!! Yum!! The issue I have is with parking, I do not think I should pay to valet in the middle of the week for lunch. Because of this I will no longer go to the Cheesecake factory."
Philipp S.,"Redondo Beach, CA",6,6,,4.0,3/2/2011,Always a great time at Cheescake Factory! Very friendly staff! I usually go with the Pasta Alfredo...soo yuummyyy!!
Eric S.,"Redondo Beach, CA",33,27,,4.0,1/15/2010,"It's the Cheesecake Factory, so you know the food is going to be good. The wine prices are pretty decent, as well. You can get a bottle for just shy of $30.  They lose a star because of the parking lot. They have a good size lot but during busy times the whole thing is set aside for valet. Basically, you have to valet your car to par there. So tack 5 bucks onto your total tab. They have a tiny lot to the side that fits about 10 cars. If you are lucky enough to grab a spot there you don't have to valet. But during busy times it is very difficult."
Traci K.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,24,,2.0,10/18/2014,"I've been dining at this location since it opened years and years ago. As a kid, the yummy cheesecakes kept me begging to have all of my birthday/good grades/sweet 16/ graduations there. As an adult, I enjoyed their massive drink and food selection - until now. Although the service is good (never had a bad experience), the food is terrible. Went tonight and ordered my usual Factory Nachos and Jumbalaya Pasta. The nachos were terrible. They replaced the real cheese with ""cheese sauce.""  The pasta was disgusting, too. My noodles were all stuck together in one big ball and the shrimp tasted like it was frozen. A far cry from when I had it in the past and they were fresh, with tails still on. Too bad the quality of food has taken a nose dive here. It used to be a great place."
Gretchen H.,"Savannah, GA",79,465,72,4.0,10/8/2010,"Welcome to the Zoo.  This place is insanely busy and I'm happy sassy Gretchen has been asleep for the last couple of years. You will be annoyed, you will wait a long time to sit but once you do it's a good experience.  I highly recommend sitting outside so you can look at the harbor and listen to the gulls and sea lions. Service was prompt and polite and of course the dessert is ridiculously amazing."
