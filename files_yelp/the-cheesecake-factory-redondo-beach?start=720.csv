D S.,"PALOS VERDES PENINSULA, CA",0,9,,5.0,7/16/2013,Have always had a great meal here.  The view is pleasant being near the ocean and the docked boats.  One can go out for a sail or cruise and end the day on a happy note.  The main course so far has always been wonderful and the cheese cake for dessert is always a pleasure to eat.  I am getting hungry again writing this.  Try the red velvet cheese cake...yum!  You can't go wrong with the original cheese cake with strawberries.  Service has been way above par.
Mary F.,"Los Angeles, CA",50,72,153,5.0,10/25/2012,It's always packed no matter what the occasion is. Food is delicious. Friendly waiters & cozy environment. But I love the cheesecake & still have yet to try them all!
Amy C.,"Los Angeles, CA",3600,621,862,3.0,1/7/2008,"This place is okay. The food has really gone downhill. I used to LOVE eating here, now its just bleh. Went here yesterday for my friend's birthday lunch. We had a party of about 10 and the service was not bad. She got our orders correctly and made sure we had water and drinks.  Ordered the miso salmon. UGH. What a disappointment. It didnt really taste like miso at all. Just salmon with some green onions on top, and LOTS of creamy stuff underneath the rice. I did not like it.  The miso glazed salmon at Grand Lux Cafe is way better. Oh well, I came here for the company, not the food, so whatevers. Probably would not come back here. And I hate valet parking. Lame."
Crystal B.,"Hawthorne, CA",13,48,3,4.0,11/17/2012,"This is one of my favorite restaurants. I went here this past weekend and as usual the service and food was great. Our server, Heather, went above and beyond my expectations to serve us, she was great! The only reason why I didn't rate this restaurant 5 stars is because of the parking. This location has a few self park spots, I usually glance when we first pull in just to make sure there are spots available, which there usually is. My past 2 visits we tell the valet we are going to self park and they tell us ""I think its full"". Clearly we can both just turn our heads and look to the left to see that its not. I'm starting to think this is what they are trained to say just to make a couple extra bucks. Other than that I love this place and all of its cheesecakes, including the seasonal pumpkin pecan!"
S H.,"Rancho Palos Verdes, CA",1,7,,5.0,10/4/2014,Our favorite family special occasion restaurant.  Their menu is vast with something for every taste ....and who doesn't like cheese cake?  Problem is remembering to save enough room for a piece after your meal.
TK T.,"Manhattan, NY",7,148,9,2.0,1/5/2010,"Been there twice. First we came to eat there dinner because everything else around the area was closed. Second time came here for just drinks. Dinner was good. I liked the seating outside because of the pleasant view and also heating. My Pina Colada came with a large slice of fresh pineapple - yum. We got one appetizer to share and a pasta dish with cajun spices, chicken and shrimp. Both were delicious and decent sizes. However, our waiter kept pressing on us to order more even though we asked to wrap the remaining food.  Second time was very similar. We decided to sit in the bar and ordered drinks and one appetizer. Our server kept coming back every 5 minutes and asking if we wanted anything else. We kept ordering drinks. However, at some point I got really sick of it and without finishing my drink asked for the bill. 2 minutes after that we were gone. And will never return again. Boooo."
Marc B.,"Long Beach, CA",40,38,5,4.0,12/12/2010,"CHEESECAKE FACTORY - always a good place to taste. For this specific cheescake factory, I must say that the parking is HORR-I-BLE. The horrible parking is due to the fact that the restaurant is located next to Redondo Beach's King Harbor - and in LA there is no such thing as good parking next to the beach (without paying for it in some form). The view once inside is very nice and the wait area is super tiny. So plan accordingly.  Try to get next to the window to look out at all the nice boats parked in the harbor. Even if you don't get a window seat, the menu is to die for (as it is at all the cheesecake factories). Since it was lunch and I was craving basic seafood, I chose shrimp and fries (pretty basic for cheescake) and my girlfriend chose Hibachi Steak and mashed potatoes with asparagus (excellent choice by the way). They have so much on the menu (a fat man in hell could not eat his way out of it), that you might as well try something that sounds good if you've never heard of it. They also have wide selection of drinks that are really good, but on this occasion I did not try.  But let's be honest, who is there for the main course? It's the CHEESECAKE factory, I came for the damn cheesecake. I got a reese's pieces chocolate cheesecake (seasonal on the menu) - turned out to be uber delicious for those peanut butter fans reading  (highly recommended). But I was so stuffed by the end I needed to take it home - shout out the our waiter Julio who did a good job. All in all, this is a good Cheesecake Factory to come check out, if it weren't for the parking I would be a fan."
Jordan P.,"Manhattan Beach, CA",225,113,5,3.0,10/6/2012,"Great location for a decent restaurant.  The Cheesecake Factory is generally pretty reliable, most of their menu items are pretty good.  And their menu is huge, so you're almost guaranteed to find sometime you'll like.  And of course, try the cheesecake.  This location is nice, its on the marina and you get a good view of the boats, especially if you sit outside.  This location is also very large, including conference space upstairs.  That said, it can get busy, so its best to call ahead.  The lot is valet only, but you can park on the street right outside for less money."
Jeff I.,"Redondo Beach, CA",39,109,18,2.0,1/14/2013,"Granted that it was a Saturday, the 1:45 minute wait was ridiculous.  (got my buzzer at 6:29pm, then got to my seat at 8:14pm) Not mention this Redondo Beach area of ONLY valet $4 parking for this strip's restaurants (same review for Joe's Crab Shack; I think they should allow the customer to park) I think the hostesses and the ""manager"" of them is not organized and well trained for seating.  They tell you 50 min...then they say, it'll be 10 minutes more...then another 10 minutes...then finally you complain and ask what the F is going on.  The manager will tell you that YOU are the priority to be seated next....then you see the same amount of people in a different party get seated before you...what is up with that?  (another 15 minutes whiz by) Then I inquire again and she tells me that they are setting up the table right now...so finally after 20 minutes pass after being told that...they better hire better bus boys cuz 20 minutes to prep  a table is too long! *I've been checking my time frequently and monitoring all actions and time it took for them to seat* The food...well, it's Cheesecake--overpriced, expected. But somehow, the one in Columbus, OH that I went to was possibly less and the food tasted better... Anyway, I got the Ceasar's Salad..but either the raw garlic in the dressing gave me heartburn or something...it tasted more like horseradish--the feeling when eating it straight. I got the Filet Mignon...medium, but charred...I don't they'll ever make my steak the way I want it AND they ALWAYS forget my steak knife, as I keep on asking for one after they bring my entree.  Moreover, I didn't realize my Filet Mignon dinner conly comes with the mean on a oval plate and a basket of friends with 3 onion rings...pretty ugly presentation...maybe they missed something? The Spaghetti with meat sauce was ok...but lay off on the black peppers cooks! The cheesecake!  This hasn't changed--decent taste.  I think I choose the more plain types of cheesecake as the others are just WAAAY to sweet and make you feel like you'll be diabetic. I gave two stars for the hostess and the lady manager for that area, as they failed at their job. My server was ok, but the bread came out way too late...waaay too late...I disliked my water in a plastic beer mug. Will probably go back for some cheese cake, but not too much for the food. Bill racked up to about $130...gave $157 total...then bought $56 of cheesecake to take home..can't go out for a while now..."
Susana M.,"Canyon Country, CA",273,350,51,5.0,3/16/2010,"I've been to this Cheesecake Factory a couple of times already... It doesn't matter at what time you go, either for lunch or for dinner....the patio is just beautiful. To top it off.... the Crusted Chicken Romano with white sauce is to DIE for. I will eat the whole thing!  I love this place :D"
Rachel J.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,15,1,2.0,8/30/2015,"This is a really nice Cheesecake Factory it overlooks the docks and ocean. We have been here at least 5 times and it's usually a hit or miss with the service. We went in on Aug. 29th around 2 o'clock and were seated immediately so that was nice. Our waitress was very nice even though she did seem busy. I ordered a Cosmo and my husband, an old fashioned. My Cosmo was very good but my husband said his drink was mainly ice and a waste of money. The food was good but my main complaint for this visit is that whoever was on dish duty in the back of the house was not washing the dishes well at all. My sons plate had food stuck on his plate and my water had a nasty brown smudge all on the inside of my glass! Even the waitress said it was totally disgusting and that she didn't want to look at it when I brought it to her attention. I do realize this is not her fault at all and she did replace my water. We were all pretty grossed out."
Denise S.,"Torrance, CA",0,19,,4.0,5/29/2013,"Went on 5/27 for a graduation dinner. Angela, sorry you had such a bad experience as we were there the same night.  I guess it really does depend on the server.  I was a little skeptical about going here after reading the less than great reviews.  I wonder if managers/owners have been reading Yelp comments (they should every day!), as the more recents reviews seem a little more favorable.  We had a very nice dinner.  I wanted to go early, being it was a holiday, wasn't sure how busy they would be.  Got there around 5:15 and was seated right away.  I believe our server's name was Summer, and she did a great job.  By 6:00 it was filling up fast. She was attentive, friendly and on top of things.  We had the chicken piccata, steak sandwich, and my friend's pasta dish (which I can't remember which one.)  All were very good.  I don't go here very often but will be back. The only comment I have is that when you pull in, on the right is a small parking lot with maybe 15-20(?) spaces, which is not valet. Park yourself if you want.  There were several spaces empty. When we pulled up the attendant opened the door and my son said he was going to park in the self park, he gave my son a dirty look and walked away.  Ok, $4.00 is great for valet, but I don't like waiting for my car to be retrieved and there was a space right up front so why not?  The way they have it set up, it looks like you HAVE to valet park. Just stay in the right lane and see if there are any spots open.  If not, the attendants work both lanes."
Masahiro M.,"Irvine, CA",56,65,31,4.0,9/12/2012,"This is the cheesecake factory. The famous restaurant chain which everyone knows. So the food menu is same as other location. The advantage of this location is the seaport view.  Great place for the family dinner, especially with kids."
Judy D.,"Carson, CA",130,4,,4.0,3/14/2012,I've been here plenty of times but have never taken the time to write a review. So here goes... For dinner I had one of my usual dishes: Miso Salmon with mashed potatoes in lieu of the white rice. If you've had the miso salmon before you have to try it with the mashed potatoes. It's heaven. For dessert I tried the mango keylime cheesecake and the piña coloda cheesecake. The mango keylime was the best by a landslide. It was a perfect balance between sweet and tart. Loved every bite of it. Our server Heather was amazing!
Rebecca V.,"Idyllwild-Pine Cove, CA",119,99,33,5.0,1/30/2011,"I am not fond of their food items other than their amazing desserts!  What I do is first eat at Captain Kidd's which has amazing fresh seafood.  Then afterwards, I walk to The Cheesecake Factory and get dessert and coffee! They have the most incredible selection of cheesecakes and some very delicious desserts including their chocolate cake.  Their portions are huge!  My date and I tend to just get one piece and split it! There is a wait most of the time though usually 1/2 or more especially on the weekends.  But their desserts are worth the wait!"
Gail K.,"Redondo Beach, CA",136,147,3,4.0,8/20/2012,"I have always likeed The Cheese as my wife calls this place, but they def have to stop changing the menu! Every time that we eat here another item that I enjoyed has been deleted from the menu! I wanted to get the Farmhouse burger which was an amazing burger with pork shoulder and egg and they deep-sixed it! The wife wanted to get the Four Seasons Pizza she had got a few months back and they had axed that one as well. I went with the Thai Chicken Pasta and the waiter told me ""they are actually taking that item off the menu tomorrow so you won't be able to order that next time you are here."" WTF stop deleting the tasty item menus! Anywho... reagardless I am still a fan!"
Evan H.,"Los Angeles, CA",56,56,49,4.0,8/18/2010,"I have one thing to say..The Cheesecake Factory Chicken w/ Shrimp Spicy Jumbalaya is very very good. If you like Jumbalaya, get it with Chicken and shrimp! The only draw back was the portion received was a lot less than what was pictured on the menu. However, the dish is now a favorite when I dine Cheesecake Factory! My other favorite is the Fettucini and Chicken with Sun Dried Tomatoes (Extra, of course)."
Ken P.,"Hermosa Beach, CA",209,254,,3.0,8/6/2010,"You can never go wrong with Cheesecake factory, especially in Redondo Beach where you get a view of the harbor and ships! Valet charged me $3.50 still even though I didn't even have my car valet, and failed to tell me that parking CLOSER lot was free. Server also missed my order but the food was good."
Anthony N.,"Playa del Rey, CA",4974,2735,19385,2.0,8/2/2009,"I'm 2-3 stars for this Cheesecake Factory, located next to the water in Redondo Beach.  I prefer the Marina Del Rey location because I find their food a little bit better (thought it is the exact same menu). We went for a happy hour, and that's not the best representation of their food--way too much fried stuff.  They actually have a few decent entree selections on their dinner menu.  The hard part is finding them on the large menu that features, steaks, seafood, pasta, comfort food, Chinese food, etc. In terms of location, this Cheesecake Factory has the standard corporate decor, but the atmosphere is a little nicer with the view of the water (though nearby Kincaid's, which does not have good food, does have a better view)."
Don N.,"Pasadena, CA",549,188,83,3.0,12/28/2011,"I really wanted to like this cheesecake factory, but I don't care too much for it. This is partly my own fault because I was passive and didn't ask for what I wanted.  Quick and Dirty: Parking: -2 stars, they'll try to trick you into valeting your car, but you can self park Location: 5 stars, beautiful right next to the water, but make sure you ask for seating next to the windows if you want them, especially if you look young.  Food: 3 stars, It isn't gourmet, except for their sauces. Once you run out of sauce, good luck finishing the big portions.  Wine: Raven's Wood Zin was good for its price.  Service: 3.5 stars, pretty decent. Attentive enough. Overall: 3 stars. I wouldn't really come back here except that it does have a nice atmosphere... that said, there are also other places on the water that I'd rather check out instead.  Longer than needed review: Parking:  Negative 2 stars. When you enter the lot, you see a valet sign with a service price. If I hadn't checked online and with yelp, I would have been conned into paying them $3.50 or so + tip to park my car like 20 feet away... instead I asked about the self-park lot... which is directly to the right of the valet sign. The problem is is that this lot is minuscule compared to the valet lot, which probably can accommodate more cars than the restaurant can diners. When we were leaving we saw a car or two lined up for the self-park lot.. so I guess I'd recommend coming a little earlier if you want to self-park. I think you can probably ask the valet if you can self-park on the valet lot side if the lot on the right side is full and/or just pay them the $3.50 because I guess it is a ritzier location.   Location:  It is right on the water so it is a pretty nice location = 5 stars Seating:  2 stars When we came they didn't seem too busy. We asked for a table for two and were seated immediately on the upper level next to the wall, still within view of the windows, but weren't really able to see out of them being as it was night (it is harder to see out at night when inside is brighter) and there were diners inbetween. I was kind of hoping for a seat closer to the windows but I was preoccupied and didn't ask.. figuring that all the seat near the windows were already taken... I was mistaken. About three minutes after we were seated I saw the hostess lead an older couple to a sear near the window. Lesson for me: Ask to be seated near the window. What the hostess could/should have done: Ask our preference and/or let us know there were seats near the window. My thoughts: She probably saw that we were young and figured we wouldn't spend/tip as much as older folks... I spent and tipped plenty, thank you.  Food:  Sauce (5 stars), Portions (3.5 stars), Once you run out of sauce (2 stars)   I've come to the conclusion that the cheesecake factory food is pretty sub-par but they have definitely mastered their sauces and give you a fair portion - we barely made a dent in our mashed potatoes. They don't seem to marinate anything, i.e. once you run out of sauce you better ask for some salt, pepper, lemon, and hot sauce. My friend and I both ordered combos. My friend ordered a Steak Diane and Herb Crusted Salmon. I ordered the Steak Diane and Chicken Madeira. They Steak Diane and Herb Crusted Salmon were decent. The chicken madeira was bland even with all the cheese on top. The lemon sauce on the salmon was really truly freaking delicious. We ended the meal with a white chocolate raspberry truffle cheese cake. The presentation of the cheesecake was pretty... they sure used a ton of whip cream to get there so great for all your whip cream lovers.  Waiter: Our first waiter I guess was breaking somebody and was really nice. He recommend a raven's wood zin to go with our steaks. We ordered one glass of that and a glass of the house merlot just to test out. I'd recommend going with the zin. The second waiter was okay; he'd come around ever once in a while but I definitely liked the first guy better - hope he got tipped out."
