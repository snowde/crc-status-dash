LuLu P.,"Los Angeles, CA",40,75,34,3.0,7/10/2010,"Besides having 100 and something things on the menu...the view was pretty pleasant. I ordered the shrimp scampi and chicken with mashed potatoes...Yum!  Shrimp scampi was ehhhh...aighhht. Pro: Good service, easy to find, great menu, even greater cheesecakes, beach-side view, casual dinning Con: Valet Parking only All in all great for lunch or dinner."
Will L.,"Cerritos, CA",10,159,1,5.0,8/7/2012,"I think some people don't like Cheesecake simply because it's a chain. I think this place is pretty awesome. Gotta try the bacon shrimp sandwhich. So dang good. Service here is EXCELLENT too. They are very cool. They close at 11pm but they still let us come in at 1030 and stay late. They were very cool I thought. They have seating next to the water too. Overall, really happy w/ my visit. Been here a few time. Would def recommend. They have good deserts here too."
Tyra W.,"Long Beach, CA",518,25,199,4.0,8/7/2010,Talk about a romantic dinner!!! Cheesecake Factory + CA sunset = kissing my date on the first date. I am biased because I am in love with the cheescake factory. I've dined at about 10 of their locations but this one is my favorite (Vegas is second). PS - Order the Red velvet cheesecake... you'll thank me later

Mina A.,"Pasadena, CA",1,181,4,2.0,10/3/2009,"This place smells SO bad, like dirty, mildew-ridden towels.  When I end up here (because let's be honest, I would never choose to dine at cheesecake factory, I just end up here), I MUST sit outside. At least outside, you don't have to suffer from the terrible acoustics and heavy foot traffic--and not to mention that AWFUL smell!!! OMG it is so bad. On a positive note, this place literally has something for everyone. I mean the menu is a book with ads."
Nancy M.,"Long Beach, CA",0,5,,1.0,8/3/2014,"My experience at this Cheesecake Factory maybe the worst I have ever had at a restaurant.  We waited a rather ling time for attention, ( I never saw her at more than 4 tables) finally our waitress came for our drink order my husband ordered a bottle of Champagne and the the waitress ask me what I wanted to drink - duh.  We could have given our order at that time - our menus clearly closed and waiting, but no such luck.  She returned with our not very cold Champagne, still did not take our order.  She returned a bit later and took our order.  I ordered the crab benedict with 'soft' eggs.  When our meal finally showed up it was covered in scrambled eggs - a word I never said, poached eggs, which the dish comes with are boiled - duh soft boiled eggs.  I sent the dish back. At least 10 maybe 15 minutes (while my husband eating his meal) later it she brought my meal with poached eggs.  Well it was not very good.  The was very little Hollindaise Sauce or crab for that matter, the poached eggs were not soft, and the dish itself was was not that great since it was 75% potato, I would add that the side offered was more potatoes or tomatoes I choose tomatoes and here it's the middle of Summer and they were tasteless.  Yes the manager came over to apologize but I didn't 'feel it'.  When my husband said I want to take home the chicken littles and nothing else, he was brought  a container.  But after he put them in and the waitress came back she did not even bother to remove his plates.  Not until he after he got his B&B and Cappuccino did she pick up the plate.  I ordered a low carb cheesecake to go, with strawberries, I decided on takeout because I could not stand to be there any longer. When I looked at what I brought home I was incredibly disappointed, the piece of cheesecake was half the size I remember from previous experiences.  The amount strawberries is chintzy as is the amount of whipped cream, I say this because my husband and I had our Wedding Reception there 23 years ago on Monday. Which was a very lovely experience.  This negative review was both a poorly trained sever and Cheesecake Factory greed.  I have longed love going to CF but now I have to wonder if I will ever go back."
Jay S.,"Irvine, CA",21,88,17,3.0,6/10/2009,"This restaurant is the perfect place to go if you're taking a big group of people who have different tastes. The menu is practically a book unto itself, and includes america, asian, and mexican cuisines, among others. I usually order the spicy cashew chicken for its bold, slightly spicy flavor. And the portions of all their food are more than enough to satisfy anyone's hunger.  With regard to service,  most waiters are just average. There are a few who go above and beyond (i can't remember their names) by giving refills without asking, making sure that things are going okay, showing great knowledge of the dishes in the menu, etc.  The main problem here is that, for some reason, the cooks often have problems forgetting to properly customize an order; for example, by forgetting to not-put-bacon on the dishes.  I have a friend who often orders the chicken and avocado club sandwich, but without the bacon. On many occasion (ie more than 6), they always leave the bacon on the sandwich, forcing her to send it back to make a new one--even though she told the waiter repeatedly to write down no bacon on the order sheet. Although this is a problem with the cooks, it nonetheless happens often. Management, however, does a good job of fixing the problem and usually compensates for the mistake by providing free cheesecake or by refunding the cost of the sandwich."
Vynetta R.,"Honolulu, HI",198,98,45,1.0,6/10/2013,"This location was horrible. Let me begin with arriving in the parking lot. The valet told us it is mandatory parking and there was no open public parking. It was $4. They forced us to  use valet service. Not to mention there is no ATM on site. We walked in the restaurant and it was out of control loud. The servers were yelling, the hostess looked confused and the manager didn't seem to have a grip on her employees, we were seated near the window which was nice. The waiter was nice however he was confused about the menu. The utensils provided were dirty. The menus that were given to us were also dirty. As I got the looking around, under the table was dirty. Like all they did was wipe the table :( the dish I ordered was the BBQ PUlled Pork Sandwich which comes with fries and a salad on the side, the pulled pork sandwich was not shredded meat but more like chunks of meat thrown in the sandwich. The sweet potatoe fries were delicious and fresh. The Salad didn't arrive until 25min later. The waiter brought me a cole slaw salad and not what was described on the menu. The drink I ordered was a Passion Mojito. No alcohol what so ever. I will not go back to this Cheesecake Factory location. Really disappointed because I love Cheesecake Factory"
Foodie M.,"Rancho Palos Verdes, CA",0,40,,4.0,6/1/2014,I really like this Cheesecake Factory.  Especially their outside patio area.  You can see all the boats docked in the marina and has a nice a lazy feel to it.  Food is always consistent.  Wish they would get rid of the valet parking and just let us park ourselves.  Hate giving a stranger my car keys.
Megan E.,"Fresno, CA",81,34,42,5.0,12/11/2012,"One of my all time favorite places.  I'm a creature of habit, i always get the Miso Salmon with brown rice.  It's awesome.."
Sam C.,"Torrance, CA",124,73,52,3.0,1/21/2012,"The food is good and the portions are huge, but the fact that they don't take any reservations is a huge pain. Expect 30+ mins for larger parties during dinner time. Its the type of place high school kids will take their dates for a 'fancy' dinner."
Elena S.,"Long Beach, CA",0,21,48,5.0,12/12/2009,We had our wedding reception here.  We rented the entire floor.  The service was amazing.  The food was incredible. The banquet managers were top notch. Overall if I had to do it again I would in a heart beat.  We were able to have a mariachi there and a dj.  They took care of all my needs and made it look incredible.  Our guest were impressed with their attention to detail.  We had cheesecake for our dessert and a chocolate fountain to go along with it.  I would recommend this restaurant not only for an everyday event but for special occasion too.  We had servers walking around and cleaning up as things went along.  The bar tender were great.  It has private bathrooms and you can use the elevator. We had 120 guest and they all fit comfortably.  We had a dance floor and we did all the traditional stuff.  They accommodated our vegetarian guests although we ordered chicken and salmon for our entrees.  They served the kids meals for the children.  The amount they charge is a set amount for the room and you can distribute it what ever way you want.   They set up our tables and everything from the guestbook to the flower pedals on the bar area.  They are professional and extremely organized.  They kept to the timeline I gave them and made sure our guest were taken care of. For all the things they did for us we have to THANK them.  They were amazing and I would recommend it to anyone having a wedding. They took so much stress out of my life.       If you would like more information please ask. * All photo I uploaded taken by Studio 7 Photography

Kathy W.,"Redondo Beach, CA",213,545,113,3.0,3/11/2012,"I have been coming to this Cheesecake Factory location since it opened over 20 years ago.  I am now beginning to think that whoever manages this restaurant has their head up their butt.  A friend is one of the servers, and he tells me the exact same thing.  For example, a server will get FIVE TABLES all at once!  How in the heck are you supposed to keep all of them happy?  Someone's going to be feeling neglected here.  But, I digress.  Three friends and I showed up this afternoon for lunch and were seated outside almost immediately, which is great as we were expecting a wait on such a beautiful day.  A server comes by and takes our drink order.  Then he comes back with another server and tells us that this guy will now be our server.  Whatever.  Another person passes right by our table to bring two of our drinks to another table, meaning we had to flag them down.  The other two drinks arrive by yet another person who again passes right by our table to deliver them to another table, so again we have to flag them down.  We finally order.  Our bread takes forever; only when we ask are we told that it's in the oven.  Fine; this means the bread will be fresh.  Two of our entrees arrive; the food runner goes right past us to another table.  He tells us that he was given the wrong table number.  I asked for the avocado in my salad to be on the side, and the kitchen interpreted this as *extra* avocado *in* the salad, so it had to go back.  Anyway, it is apparent that there is utter chaos in this facility, on this day at least.  On the positive side, the food and atmosphere were great.  We all enjoyed what we ordered, and we split a slice of absolutely fabulous mango key lime cheesecake that had this to-die-for coconut macaroon crust.  I just wish they could get the rest of their act together, then they would deserve more stars."
Keisha J.,"Redondo Beach, CA",0,5,,4.0,8/7/2014,Love eating here. Their food is amazing and their cheesecakes are out of this world. It's always a little crowded and parking is a little tight so only gets 4 stars but food and drinks here is 5 stars.

Ahmed B.,"Sault Ste. Marie, MI",12,42,3,4.0,1/14/2013,I just ordered a Cake for takeaway .. so It's really hard to rate it .. It was busy and a lot of people in out .. but like the location ..
Gianna R.,"Lake Worth, FL",1388,542,716,4.0,3/31/2011,You can never go wrong with Cheesecake Factory the food is always good and the service is always good but this location does have the best view out of any Cheesecake Factory I have been to...
Scotty E.,"Santa Monica, CA",306,106,138,4.0,3/25/2010,"There are so many things about Cheese cake factor that are right.  This has been mine and my girlfriends go to restaurant when we don't know where we want to eat. This menu is jam packed full of all kinds of different foods.  There really is something for everyone.  We always order an appetizer because they have so many good ones.  The artichokes are a good starting point.  One of my favorite dishes they have is the Herb Crusted Salmon.  It's cooked perfectly aside some amazing mashed potatoes.  My girlfriends favorite dish is the Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic.  I really haven't had something that I didn't like off their menu.  Last but not least, get the cheese cake.  Try anyone because they are all good!! The service is almost always good and this location has a great view of the wharf.  This is also a great place to bring friends or have a quite date night."
Debbie E.,"Hermosa Beach, CA",89,937,16,3.0,5/27/2010,"Try the made-to-oder guacamole.  It's not made at your table but they ask Mild, Medium, or Spicy.  We got Medium and glad we did since it defintely had a kick to it!  It was very yummy.  Didn't have enough chips with it but they brought us more when we asked. As per law, they also now provide a separate 'menu' that lists every item and the calorie contect.  Beware.  Do not open unless you want to fell guity during your dining experience.  Hey, it's the Cheesecake Factory.  If you come here and are worried about calories, this is not the place for you."
