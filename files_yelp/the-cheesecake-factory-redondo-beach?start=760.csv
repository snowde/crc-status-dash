Angelica S.,"Carson, CA",61,5,,5.0,12/29/2012,I just LOVE the banana cream cheesecake . it is soo good for all the banana lovers! and their Jambalaya is just simply perfect!
Mindy K.,"The Loop, Chicago, IL",1,12,3,1.0,10/25/2012,"Dirty and bad service!  Saw a busboy wipe the table with a rag then put the fork on it! Our spoon came with a dried piece of what looked like a green onion on it!  And we had to wait 15 minutes to get our water refilled!  Food was ok, passable, but nothing special!  Asked to speak to a manager, then had to wait 10 minutes for her to show up!  Totally unacceptable!"
E S.,"Hawthorne, CA",3,7,,4.0,8/21/2012,"Went here for dinner tonight with 14 friends for one of their birthdays. The host seemed a bit lost initially, but was nice. She quickly called the manager to speak to us about out seating options and wait times. He walked around the restaurant to show us our options. He had the waiters set up our tables quickly as we were seated within 5 minutes. Had the filet with a bit of steak butter. The steak was very tender. My friend ordered the steak med-well and even that was soft and tender. The red velvet cheesecake, it was awesome!! I also tried a bit of the tiramisu cheesecake and I liked that even more. Overall a good experience"
Grace A.,"Carson, CA",69,154,18,4.0,3/1/2010,"This location has a nice view of the coast whether you're sitting outside or in.  Great place for a nice casual romantic dinner with the boyfriend.  Two of my favorite dishes are the shrimp angel-hair pasta and the chicken ceasar salad. The food is just so tasty and the portions are large, so I always walk out with leftovers.  Of course, you can't end the night without trying one of their cheesecakes! Being the old school person that I am, I always order their classic cheesecake (with strawberry topping). This is probably what I'm looking forward to the most. Creamy and oh so tasty! Service here is great. Staff is very nice and always check on you every 5 minutes. Everything is quick and there always seems to be enough table for everyone.  But like everyone else has mentioned, the parking is terrible. Valet parking? Are you kidding me?  And the cheesecake is a little pricey for a slice.  But overall, good food."
Melisa K.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,1,,1.0,5/9/2011,"My  family and I went to the Redondo Beach location for Mother's Day dinner. Our first mistake was going to the Cheesecake Factory on such a busy day, and our second was actually waiting over an hour and a half to be seated. Nonetheless we waited and we ate, but it was the worst experience I have ever had at Cheesecake Factory. I am a regular at the Sherman Oaks location, because that is where my office is, and I have never been so disappointed in the service, or lack thereof.  As we approached the restaurant we knew there was going to be a long wait, as there were several groups waiting outside. We put our names down, and we were told that for a table of 7 inside it would be an hour and a half wait if not less. We decided to sit in the bar area and order a few drinks and appetizers while we were waiting for our pager to buzz. Approximately an hour and 40 minutes later, our pager buzzed and we went up to the front desk. We were then taken to our table, which was where we were just sitting! They sat us back in the bar area, had we wanted to dine there we could have ordered our dinner earlier and finished eating and not have waited an hour and half to be seated. In addition to the lousy seating area, the table cloth was dirty with recent stains from earlier guests. To make matters worse, the girl who brought us to our table, and whom we initially complained to, did not take the time to listen to our complaint or apologize. All she kept saying was I can get a manager. What was really infuriating was when we said we did not want to eat at this table, but to eat at a table in the dining area of the restaurant (which is what we were waiting to be seated for), she responded with: It's Mother's Day and you're going to have to wait a really really long time to be seated. At that point we asked to speak to a manager.  We waited and waited for a manager, the nice gentleman who was waiting our table earlier came by to check on us, he asked if a manager was coming, and he was very helpful. Ten minutes later we got another table, but the manager never came to talk to us, never diffused the situation or came to here our complaint, just ignored the problem and offered a different table (which we should have been seated at to begin with). Had the manager came he would have known that the table cloth was dirty, that his associate needed a lesson in customer service, and that we were dissatisfied with our visit before we had even ordered our dinner.  We were seated and greeted by a waitress who was filling in for our waiter who was on a break. She took our orders and introduced our waiter shortly afterwards when he returned from his break. Our food arrived and my order was wrong. I asked for no bacon, because I don't eat bacon, and she even repeated my request when I ordered, but of course my meal came with bacon and I had to send it back. This was the most miserable visit to the Cheesecake Factory, and will definitely not visit this location again."
Micole C.,"Los Angeles, CA",47,230,45,2.0,9/1/2011,"I didn't think a cheesecake factory could be worse than the one in Marina when it took on a hood element clientele (yeah i said it sue me or call the PC police i really don't care) but seriously if you go to this one for the view like i did don't waste your time and go to Marina location. First, we were seated outside & although the view was nice as you are literally right next to the water & boats they have these huge glass windowpane's blocking anything ocean or breezy it totally killed the whole vibe.  Now I am assuming that this is because of the short distance to the water that these huge panels are to prevent water blow back, but they are so big and tall they COMPLETELY block any possible or even hint of an ocean breeze which sucks. And I know it doesn't have to be like this because there is a now defunct restaurant next door that I saw when we walked on the pier & its windows opened, I mean the cheesecake factory could have had windows like that so their would be a breeze flowing...im sorry but aside from the view & environment in general one of the perks of ""ocean side eating"" is a nice ocean breeze and there is NONE here. Ill just keep going to Marina location because even though you aren't right next to the water as here, you don't feel trapped in a fish bowl and get nice breeze & view. Second, our waitress didn't like me. I have no clue what i did to this woman in a past life but she was horrible and to make it worse, I came with my bff & the waitress gave her impeccable service the whole time  -_-. I kid you not when I say this started from the beginning, her first time at the table she asked my best friend if she wanted something to drink, she told her what she wanted and then waitress went to get it, not once acknowledging my presence or asking me about my drinks. I wont keep going but it went like that the whole time. smh Finally, I think these are new but you absolutely must look at the skinnylicious menu and try the Chicken Samosas...OMG those are the best things that have hit my mouth in a long time.  Talk about flavorful & extra yummy they are a must try!!! oh but the skinny mojito bleh something was off about it & i didn't taste any rum... don't order. all in all i tried here because i  just discovered this location but i wont be back...ill just return to Marina like I've been doing for years, ill just go during the off peak hours."
Enrique G.,"Wilmington, CA",5,98,,4.0,12/14/2011,"I have driven by this place a bunch of times and never bothered to go in and try it out. Ended up going here for a work meeting and enjoyed it very much. All of the food is great, the bread they bring to the table is warm and with a little butter it hits the right spot! All of the dishes that I have seen are huge!!! so be ready to eat or share! For dessert the Red Velvet CheeseCake is a MUST!!!! You wont regret it!!!"
Brenda K.,"Los Angeles, CA",544,72,8,4.0,12/12/2011,"Ambience is fantastic (nothing beats an oceanside view), service is great, but the best reason to come here is for, of course, the cheesecake."
Sahar S.,"San Pedro, CA",137,17,1,1.0,12/14/2008,"This has always been a favorite spot of mine... picturesque location, good food, nice staff, and attentive service.  Note the word ""has.""  Although the location is as lovely as ever, and the food is still good, their service has hit the PITS!  No joke.  Seriously, I get better service at In-N-Out!  Cheesecake Factory: FAIL.  Big time. What happened to you old friend?  My reliable and constant friend is no longer....nope; it is now replaced by a shell with incompetent cooks and inept management.  How sad.  I guess as the economy goes down, The Cheesecake Factory (TCF) thinks that the level of service can go down, too.  How distressing. I paid a visit to TCF about ten days ago with a friend.  It was a Thursday night, and the place was comparatively busy.  I ordered a Raspberry Martini (très délicieux) and their scrumptious Avocado Eggrolls.  So far so good.  I ordered the Chopped Salad which comes with Romaine Lettuce, Grilled Chicken, Tomato, Avocado, Corn, Bacon, Blue Cheese, Apple and a House Vinaigrette.  Being the ever-so-picky eater that I am (wish I wasn't...but I am), I requested NO bacon, blue cheese, and tomato.  Rather, I asked them to double-up on the avocado and corn.  My friend ordered the Classic  Burger.  The waitress asked how he wanted it cooked and he said medium-well.   Our food arrived, and much to my dismay, my chopped salad was missing the corn and avocado.  The two items I had specifically requested were MIA.  How disappointing.  My friend's hamburger looked great on the outside - but inside, it was another story.  The hamburger he requested was medium-well.  What he got was medium-rare.  Big difference.  Like oozing with blood difference.  The waitress came by and I informed her about the mistake with my salad.  My friend explained the mistake with his hamburger.   The waitress was sweet and apologized to the both of us.  She said she would bring my items, and put in a new order for my friend.  He said told her ""no"" that it was OK, he would just eat the fries, but she wouldn't take NO for an answer.  He told her that he had lost his appetite for a hamburger (Eww, wouldn't you?).  So he ordered a Chopped Salad like mine - but with all the trimmings. About 10 minutes later, a ""Manager"" brought my missing items.  She then asked my friend what had happened to his order.  He explained it to her.  She apologized.  Although my salad looked amazing and tempting, I sat and waited for my friend's salad to come. Irritated?  Yes, a bit.  I turned to the manager and said in a cute-meets- persuasive-tone ""I'm sure you will make this up to us with a nice dessert.""  Hint-Hint.  The manager smiled and said, ""Oh, I've already taken care of his meal"" and walked away.   His salad arrived, and we were able to finally eat our meal.  Our waitress asked if we wanted any dessert, and we said no.  I eagerly waited for the check to come to see what the manager had done.  Much to my astonishment, the only ""action"" she had taken was swapping a salad for the hamburger!  All I could say out loud to my friend was ""WTF?  Really?  Are you effin' kidding me?"" So, Cheesecake Factory,  let me get this straight: 1.  You Efff-up on not only one, but BOTH orders 2.  You make us wait 3.  You DON'T volunteer a free dessert for your faux pas, much less offer         to make the entire meal ""on the house""  4.  You put a total damper into our dining experience 5.  When your customer (AKA , me) suggests that you ""throw in"" a       dessert for your bungling  mistakes, you reply with ""Oh, I've already      taken care of his meal"" 6.  You LIE about ""taking care"" of any part of his meal.  Deleting an order       that was incorrect and adding a new order of a salad does not        mean ""you've take care of his meal"" Capiche?  Let me repeat that,         CAPICHE? All I have left to say is Shame, Shame, Shame on you Cheesecake Factory!  My friend begged me to let this issue go...to not call in that ""manager"" for a few words.   I obliged.  However, if he was NOT with me, I would have let that ""manager"" know that what she did, or rather, what she DID NOT DO, was unprofessional and unacceptable.   With so many businesses going down the drain in this economy, with so many restaurants at our fingertips to choose from, do you really think that skimping on service will win you back former fans?  Not this fan.  Taco Bell does a better job training for their cooks and management!   What a total disappointment and what a total waste of a Thursday night."
Cassie G.,"San Jose, CA",318,17,20,4.0,5/14/2012,"I had a really great experience at this Cheesecake Factory.  I have been to many before, but this was my first time at this location.  We were sat right next to the window with a beautiful view of the harbor.  Perfect seat!  I tried their veggie burger from their ""skinny"" menu and it was disgusting, I guess I didn't realize how much I don't like beets!  But, the server kindly took it off our tab and said I could order something different.  I never take food back, but this was just needed.  The manager also came out and asked for our suggestions and what exactly we didn't like about it.  I thought that was so professional!  Our servers were great and we had a great time.  :)"
Cheesebucket T.,"Rancho Palos Verdes, CA",116,133,14,4.0,6/21/2012,"I love the location of this cheesecake factory.  I think this is one of my favorite location I have been, too.  If I were to go cheesecake factory, I think I will choose this location because its right on the beach.  It was very beautiful day and enjoyed nice meal at lunch time outside patio.  It was busy day so server did not come so often but it was ok, but food was delicious:)"
M. M.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,31,10,1.0,6/17/2012,"While I really love the cheesecake here, I have to say it is the worst place to go and eat.  My trip today for a cup of coffee and cheesecake was the most basic thing to serve up.  First when I arrived the wait was fairly short, but they were so disorginzed at sitting people down.  All at once five or six groups were paged and asked to stand to one side until someone could lead them to their table.  That meant there were something like twenty people huddled around the host desk.  When we were led to our table apparantly a man sat down at our table to eat.  He left the bar area to sit down wherever he liked without regard to others.  Nothing was said to him, but I had to go back to wait to be called again.  When we were finally sat down, I noted that they had set the utensils on each side of a small dish with a napkin a top.  My first thought was that the utensils should have been placed on top of the napkin.   Supposedly all the table had been cleaned but there were all type of food stains on the sides and corners.  The cup of coffee that my husband and myself had ordered BOTH had lipstick on it.  The mug of water that was served up had all kinds of food debries on the rim of the glass.  The waitress wiped down the spoons that we had asked for before coming back to our table.  They must not have been clean, I think that the food stuck to the spoon itself gave it away.  The only thing I can say is YUCK!!!  The only plus here was that the waitress was so freiendly and cheerful.  I can say I will never be coming back htuck here again!!!  I am not the only one that thinks it's dirty and it's sad to say.   I may consider calling DHS on them. I agree with one of the other reviews that had mentioned the horrible coffee!  It's soooo TRUE!  Worst of all is that the waitress had decided to place the coffee cups on the table holding it by the top of the cup instead of using the holder.  So you mean you are going to tuch the rim of my cup where I am going to place my lips on?  Can you say bacterial transmission?"
Taye D.,"Inglewood, CA",10,13,4,1.0,2/17/2014,"I've dined here before and has always enjoyed myself.  Well this time on Sunday 2/16/14 it changed terribly.  We were seated right by the back door on the patio where the servers come in/out of.  Our server didn't bring the complimentary bread.  When he finally did come he stated that he would v light the heater (which never did get cut on) We finally placed our orders,  never did get the bread so I can take my medicine that I asked for.  20mins pass still no bread or water.  Another server came by and asked were we okay,  my husband at that moment asked for water.  We got it from her, Our server passed by us roughly 3x before finally stated that he would check on our food.  Again another server delivered our food.  Note that with a hamburger and fries,  there should be condiments delivered to your table (ketchup etc) We told our server could we have some ketchup and bread for my entree (still nothing).  I finally asked the host for a box,  check and mgr. We got 2 out of the 3. No manager since it was busy.  Server finally came and dropped off my credit card.  No offer for dessert, no apologies nothing.  I truly felt that I've always been treated great here but this visit,  the ball was dropped.  I know I'm only one guest among the hundreds that visit the restaurant but I'm truly hurt. I may just have to go back to cramped Marina for my jambalaya and avocado rolls."
Joanna K.,"Irvine, CA",0,3,,1.0,5/18/2014,"Had dinner for a party of 11 tonight.  Service was extremely poor.  I had to ask for a cup of water 3x's.  After the 3rd request to have the outside heaters turned on, I went and looked for the manager myself to turn it on.  We were seated at 6pm but our food did not arrive until 7:30pm.  The service was extremely slow.  We had to wait a long, long time for bread, for water, for our meal to come out, for our boxes and had to ask multiple times for a plastic bag.  Service was so poor, we had no desire to order dessert and have to wait another hour to finish being served."
Tiffany J.,"Placentia, CA",0,3,,1.0,9/18/2012,"Absolutely the WORST Cheesecake Factory ever!!!! I came here a couple of years ago, so decided to come here with my bf. We arrived and they gave us the pager, our pager buzzed and we had to wait another ten minutes for them to set up the table. Granted it was a Saturday night.  It was in the worst location possible. It was right by the door, the servers kept walking in and out and when I complained one of the servers put a towel on handle which supposedly was a sign to stop walking through the door but the servers continued to walk blowing cold air every couple of minutes. The waitress never came to refill the drinks. The food took over 20 minutes to arrive. My tacos were cold and my bf's pasta was uneatable. His food had definitely been sitting under the heat lamps, the noodles were soggy on bottom and dry on top. Everything was bad. We sent back the pasta.  The waitress never came back. She completely ignored our table. We had to ask for the check. Never coming back here again."
Jade C.,"Orange County, CA",1,117,51,5.0,1/24/2012,"I've visited this Cheesecake Factory a couple of times now and have determined that this is one of the nicer ones out there. The inside looks a little older than some of the baby Cheesecake Factories, but it definitely gives the restaurant more character...and plus it looks well-kept. This particular one seems to have an extra touch of charm that the other ones are lacking a little. The service is fairly good, the food is great, and atmosphere is nice."
C A.,"Los Angeles, CA",20,92,816,4.0,10/10/2009,"This location for this national chain has been an ""old faithful"" of mine for many years. You know the food will be nice, the cheesecake is always delicious, and it's a place to go for a casual or nicer event (I've been here for birthdays and graduations... I think even my own high school graduation). Even though the food isn't the greatest, the location is decent and though it can be a tight fit, they are able to accomodate large parties... a big enough party and you can probably set up something for the upstairs area.  Meals are a little pricy for what you get, but I guess you're paying for the atmosphere and the plates are very filling... I rarely have room for cheesecake after dinner. (ave. $16/ dinner plate and $7-8 for cheesecake) The things that annoy me here is that you can't make reservations... there is always at least a little bit of a wait, but it could be 30 to 45 minutes if there is some sort of event (like graduations). You may want to call and ask how long the wait is if you're hungry now. Also, you are pretty much forced to valet park which is more of a minor annoyance since it is cheap, but I like to park my own car. The service has always been pretty friendly, but sometimes they just disappear and you're left wondering when your drink will ever be refilled. This is a water front restaurant, but for some reason the view isn't very attractive here and I bearly notice it. The outdoor patio is nice, though it can get windy and keep the beach temp. in mind. The biggest draw for me comes on half price cheesecake day at the end of July? It was on a weekday this year which makes it a bit of a pain to get to, but the secret is to just buy the cheesecake at the counter to go."
David L.,"Meridian, ID",1776,815,794,3.0,2/21/2010,"I like the cheesecake factory. This location is the first cheesecake factory I had ever been to. Since the early 90s, I've been to several of these throughout the United States.  You get a lot of choices on their menu, and at this location they have a terrific view of the pacific ocean. That said, their parking situation here is terrible!  On the plus side, I've never had to wait more than 15 minutes for a table here. I prefer the outdoor patio in the summertime, and the window seats away from the patio door on cooler nights.  All their food is ""good"", but other than their actual cheesecake, nothing is truly ""great"". A lot of their offerings are greasy, but they've added some healthy options to their menu.  I don't go to this location as much as I would like to just due to the parking situation. Yet despite the parking mess, this place seems to always be extremely busy after about 7:30 PM. I personally would not arrive any later than 7 PM."
Stan C.,"Cerritos, CA",89,69,23,3.0,1/21/2009,"It's hard to go wrong with Cheesecake... I mean seriously, I'm always hesitant to go, but when I do, and I see like the 25 page menu with all faves from all across the world, it puts a smile on my face... Normally, I'd give any normal Cheesecake 4-stars, this location, however, I had to give 3 because of our waiter... and he wasn't just any waiter. This guy was big-time Axis II (Clin Psych language), meaning he was crazy. Went here for Holiday dinner with coworkers and this guy would not stop talking. He's one of those people that keep giving you options and options, and he tries to convince you out of what you order, and gives you a condescending look when you decide on your own choice, and you're like WTF mofo?! The following is exactly how it played out, no exaggeration: My supervisor asked for a diet coke, then the waiter say ""You know, a great alternative to diet soda is Fresca, it has a brisk and sweet taste of what you want in a cold beverage without all the icky stuff that comes in a diet soda."" ""Um, I think I'll just stay with the diet coke"" ""You sure about that, sir, sometimes people are hesitant to try it because they've never heard of it, but it's new, and I personally prefer it over our conventional diet sodas"" ""Ya, I'll stick with the diet coke"" ""*looks away*... okay sir, got it""... *looks at me* ""And you?"" ""Diet coke, thanks"" This went on and on, with everything that 8-9 people ordered... from drinks to sandwiches, to salad, but mid-dinner, everyone was fed up and told the guy NO DESSERT just b/c he throws 15 options at you, you choose your own or one of them, and he looks away if you didn't get what he wanted.  Feel bad for the guy, but maybe he should just work at in-n-out, then he wouldn't have 90 items to choose from to tell people about.  ....anyway, food, you have to order the Avocado Egg Rolls. Unbelievable!!"
Louie B.,"Torrance, CA",192,226,25,4.0,8/17/2011,"Bang! Bang! Yummm... Love the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp! I ordered it for the first time while family was in town and they told me how delicious it was. They weren't kidding. Full of flavor and a perfect amount of spice to go with it. It was a good healthy portion, I had to stop halfway through in order to leave room for the namesake dessert! The Tiramisu Cheesecake, just saying that is making me salivate.. Sweet and rich, but not too rich. Once you get that first bite, you just can't stop.. I'm not usually big on sweets, but I will go to town on some cheesecake!!"
