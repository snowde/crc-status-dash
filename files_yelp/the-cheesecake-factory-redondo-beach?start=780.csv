Simone T.,"Hermosa Beach, CA",71,85,7,4.0,9/12/2008,"I've eaten at various locations over the years and they're all pretty consistent.  Not the best place but certainly never bad either. What's gotten me really excited is that I had the very best Salty Dog I've ever tried at this location.  If you're a Salty Dog lover, you absolutely must try one here!  It tasted exactly like biting into a fresh grapefruit with salt sprinkled on top.  So juicy, so yummy. I wish I could find out what brand of grapefruit juice they use.  When we asked, the bartender said the only thing on the box was ""Grapefruit Juice.""   Oh well, I guess we'll just have to go back.  Twist my arm :)."
Kevin S.,"Santa Monica, CA",1,22,1,5.0,1/25/2012,Cheesecake factory always keeps the standards high and the huge variety of food great.
Charles J.,"Torrance, CA",0,11,,4.0,3/11/2014,"One of my favorite restaurants.  Great selection of foods and never have had a bad meal there.  Staff is friendly.  Friday evening January 17, 2014 came in with a party of 11 and told it would be 20 minutes.  They don't take reservations.  Took almost 45 minutes to get a table.  Spoke to Manager.  He was very professional explaining what the problem was and sent us free appetizers when we were seated."
Silvana C.,"Redondo Beach, CA",17,49,5,4.0,10/18/2011,"HAPPY HOUR! So one friend told me they have happy hour so i gave it a try and let me tell you this is by far one of the best happy hours around! many many choices! the appetizers are regular size! ONLY $5! so they will fill you up. I've had the fresh made guacamole with chips it was tasty and super fresh! the crab wontons with cream cheese are to die for !! really good, you do taste the crab. Hmm what else oh the fried calamari is good too, their small salads are healthy and delicious, i saw another table get the sliders and they looked amazing and big! the only two things i don't recommend is the corn cake tamale that is super sweet and is not really a tamale because it has no meat, and the dumplings because they were a little oily. Now for drinks i got the mojito and i liked it, the margarita was good but stronger so u can get that if you want a buzz, the second time i went with my boyfriend we got beer i believe only $4 for an imported premium draft which is a good deal( we don't drink the light piss beers such as budlight,coors light, and those i rather have water! ). Monday-friday 4-6pm i believe but call and ask them the time. The only reason i didnt give 5 stars because sometimes the service can be lousy depends who you get other than that 5 stars."
Karyn K.,"Studio CIty, Los Angeles, CA",19,43,,2.0,9/24/2008,"It's a chain. They're okay. However, if LA passes the nutritional info requirement law Cheesecake Factory will be in big doodoo. Everything is pretty greasy and heavy- even the salads. The bread is always good. I would say service is hit and miss at best. My thought is, if you're looking for a place to eat and the best option you can think of is Cheesecake Factory you get an A for laziness and an F for creativity."
Maria E.,"Garden Grove, CA",75,14,8,3.0,11/16/2011,I loved this location its got an ocean view front only bad thing was your valet parking other than that the food is aways wonderful
Tosh I.,"Los Angeles, CA",570,806,604,3.0,8/18/2010,"Years ago, this was the place to go for several reasons: nice view of the boats in the harbor, a vast variety and a menu as extensive as a novel, so there's something for everyone, and enough food to take home for a second meal.  This is a great choice for large groups with picky eaters.   Also, the cheesecakes are good, but most of the time, one can be too full to truly enjoy them.   I recently came here again as we had a gift card.  Service seemed better than what I remembered.  The wait for my dish took longer than the rest of our party.  I didn't have to flag down the manager.  He informed me that my dish was being redone.   I appreciated the proactiveness.  But my spicy chicken was not up to par, and the manager graciously took it off the bill.  I was already semi full anyway from my fave, the avocado egg rolls. So I ""begrudgingly"" :  )  ordered dessert... the Red Velvet cheesecake.  This is no ordinary cheesecake as it was not on the menu the last time I came here.   Now, I have fond nostalgic memories of Red Velvet cake after living in Texas, so my expectations are high.  I'm also both delighted and disappointed at how mainstream it's become lately.  Bastardization of Red Velvet cake won't do! To enjoy the full effect, I had my Red Velvet cheesecake the very next night for dessert.  The cake itself was moist and had that hint of chocolate.  The white chocolate frosting and the whipped cream were divine.  Of course, the cheesecake section did not disappoint either.  I like the tiramisu here too.   It does add up here (both monetarily and calorie-wise), but you do get your money's worth.   It's fun to come here and order a bunch of appetizers and desserts to share with your friends.  We used to do that during the holidays.   This is a good place to take your out of town friends who visit so they can enjoy the view and have a plethora of food to choose from."
Scott G.,"Palos Verdes Peninsula, CA",166,402,42,4.0,6/30/2011,I have been coming here for years and rarely have I had a bad experience.  The food is good and they add new items quite a bit to keep the menu fresh.
Keisha H.,"Los Angeles, CA",78,258,170,4.0,7/6/2010,"Let's start by saying that I love the CCF. I will never turn down a trip to this place. Ok pay close attention. I had great service on a busy 4th of July. Dion our server was great!!! Friendly, timely and very patient considering we order our food randomly. Dessert after an appetizer. My son's food before we receive drinks. You get the picture my lady is not always easy to please. So here is the problem she ordered the Bang Bang Chicken and shrimp..... wait for it.... Her shrimp still had a little bang bang it in it if you know what I mean. It grossed her out. Doo Doo vein in The shrimp. Sorry but that's a fail. We didn't get mad. Dion said no big deal took it back. 5 minutes later out comes this little man who I presume was the shift manager or supervisior or head douche. Standing at maybe 5 feet tall Mauricio spoke with my lady and said he didn't see any veins and he checked all the shrimp in her plate. As though we were making it up or something. Then was like are you gonna order something else or are you done. DUHH idiot she is obviously hungry yes we are!!! Now mind you our bill was $105 dollars. Drinks, appetizers, dessert, two entrees and a kids pizza. Mauricio AKA Little Big Man we don't need to have our food comped we got this. Secondly your ill manner, rude tone and total disregard for customer service will have you unemployed and in this economic climate shorty I suggest you get it together. :-)  Dion we will be back!!! I love the CCF!!!!!"
Meg N.,"Culver City, CA",1,9,,1.0,6/18/2012,"Seriously! 2 hour wait on a Saturday! I understand they are busy on weekends, but atleast invest in a reservation system. It's not fun to walk in , put your name and then be told to wait outside for an hour instead of being told to come back in an hour. We are in the digital age for christ's sake!  With a hungry 3 year old in tow, this wasn't a good experience at all. Oh and to add to it, it is predominantly valet parking (I didn't notice the small self-parking until much later). So you have to pay for your parking, wait for 2 hours, and wait for your food and pay for this whole experience!"
Johnny N.,"Anaheim, CA",174,787,1042,4.0,6/17/2009,"Location, location, location. This is one Cheesecake Factory that is unique... the marina provides a nice backdrop for your dining enjoyment. Just the location is 3.5 worth of stars. I always ask to sit outside on the deck.... why come here to stay inside?  It might as well be any other CF. The rest is all about the food, especially the variety.  I like CF, and there are so many items (dare I say, too many items?) to choose, which is good for a varied group.  But the food is by noe means mindblowing... just good and reliable.  I've had decent and above service every time I've been here, but it sure is crowded.  So, not worthy of 5 stars, but it's a solid dining outing."
Natalie R.,"Gardena, CA",0,13,,5.0,2/20/2014,"i like this location better than the marina location. they have a amazing view of the docks. they have great drinks and are reasonably priced there pina colada, mai tais are great there steak diane was great and the shrimp scampi the mash potatoes were delicious i love there buffalo blast are my favorite"
Julius L.,"Fort Worth, TX",40,76,53,4.0,8/19/2009,"I came here for desserts after biking along the coast. The bike rental place was at the corner of their parking lot. This was a great treat after a day of biking. The 1000 calorie slice of cake put back some of the padding that I had lost that day. I recommend the Carrot cake and the red velvet w/ a cup of coffee to counter the sweetness. The service was great and we came just in time for the sunset. Best thing was they were very pleasant eventhough we only order cakes and coffee.  Next time, I will get the cakes to go on the bike ride so that I can take a break and enjoy it on the beach."
Vanesa S.,"Merit-Carson, CA",34,60,6,2.0,7/16/2009,Their menu was way too long... I thought it was overwhelming.  I ordered a soup and salad for like... 11 bucks (with tax.) Kind of overpriced. My dad ordered a Chicken Club Sandwich but the bread was soggy so he couldn't pick it up!!  My family seemed to enjoy the place. I thought it was way too overpriced. It was my sister's 23rd birthday. Our server sang happy birthday.
Day-Trader ..,"Los Angeles, CA",39,305,517,3.0,11/6/2008,"I dont go to cheesecake factory often cause it's pricey. 1. I feel like your paying for the atmosphere more than anything. 2. It's like a friday night date type of joint.  3. The menu is very extensive, it's like a book. 4. The cheesecake is good but way over priced, for regular cheese cake I rather go to jack in the box and get there cheesecake for few bucks vs. like $10 dollars for a slice. 5. Never ever get a whole cheesecake, this is what happened to me. I loved the banna cream cheese cake so i got a whole pie which costs like $50. I didnt know that they keep the cheese cakes frozen in the freezer and when i got home and thawed it out it was soggy very disappointed. 6. It's a cool place to hang out once in a while with friends that how i feel about cheesecake factory."
Kirk M.,"Hermosa Beach, CA",3,5,,5.0,12/28/2011,"I love this Cheesecake factory.  It is great every single time.  The staff is on top of it and they are nice.  The food is awesome.  I've been going to the Cheesecake Factory since it was only one restaurant in Beverly Hills.  At first, I was really worried that went it became corporate and opened tons of restaurants all over the country that the quality would suffer.  That is not the case.  The menu is a large novel with a huge culinary vocabulary.  It's fun to be able to get something new every time if you want, and pretty much count on it being delightful.  CCF rocks!"
Candy N.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,14,,1.0,12/23/2011,"Good food, horrible customer service.  I reserved a pumpkin cheesecake for a family holiday dinner and asked my son, who works across the street from the restaurant, to pick it up.  When he got there they said they'd lost the reservation and didn't have any more available.  The employee's attitude was ""so what.  Choose another flavor.""  The manager was ""unavailable.""  Good as their food may be, I'll never depend on them again."
Marie Y.,"Azusa, CA",114,155,13,4.0,7/13/2008,"I do like Cheesecake Factory.  A lot.  Problem is, every time I come here I never have enough room for dessert.  I'll have to make a special trip just for that sometime. Anyhoo...had dinner at the Redondo Beach location with my two boys.    We had a gorgeous view of the marina from our table with the sun setting in the background.  Hubby ordered the prime rib and I had the garlic noodles with chicken, which I shared with baby.  Hubby enjoyed his rib, but my noodles had a little too much sauce.  So I used the sourdough bread to mop up some of the excess. Our server, Joel, took really good care of us.  While we were waiting for our order, baby was hungry but didn't want the snacks we had for him.  So Joel brought him his own plate of bread and sliced bananas, and baby was really happy.  What service! Now as for dessert (which we didn't have) here's what I would've selected:   Cheesecake: Key Lime, Snickers Bar or Peanut Butter & Chocolate Other: Carrot cake or strawberry shortcake I'm feeling bloated just thinking about these treats.  But I know that Cheesecake Factory will have them ready for me when I return!"
Jen Y.,"Torrance, CA",0,4,,4.0,1/24/2014,"I love cheesecake factory! I've been here couple of times. The one thing I hate is the parking here. They only have a limited amount of self-parking spots which is usually taken, so you either have to valet or park on the street. I've tried couple of different items of the menu but the only thing I ever order is chipotle chicken pasta and avocado eggroll!"
Kandy G.,"Los Angeles, CA",29,143,10,4.0,4/30/2011,Nice place...next to the beach...could totally turn romantic if you chose to seat outside...excellent customer service....food if good of course....yummy pasta...my fave is 4 cheese pasta...which i always make it 5 cheese when i add the parmessan...ahhaha
