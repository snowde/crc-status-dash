Janet V.,"Redondo Beach, CA",53,55,69,2.0,1/23/2017,"Let me start by saying that I love the Cheesecake Factory. I've been coming to this location since 1988.  These 2-stars were barely earned.  We came for a small family dinner (5 people) for my daughter's 16th birthday.  We were seated in a booth right next to a screaming child.  I would understand if they were busy, but they weren't.  I mentioned to the hostess that this wouldn't work and she just stared at me like 'what do you want me to do?'.  We kept the table. Then for dinner I ordered chicken marsala with pasta.  There was so much parsley sprinkled into the food after cooking it was all I could taste.  When I mentioned to the server she looked at my plate and agreed with me - that was all she did.  We also had to ask for bread. The cheesecake was good as expected. The 'birthday sundae' was nice - but the fudge was so rock hard it couldn't be spooned out.  My dad also had ice cream with fudge and had the same issue. Overall I was very disappointed with the service, the food, and how run down this location has become.  I remember now why it was a year since our last visit."
Maricris O.,"Granada Hills, CA",124,77,203,5.0,8/4/2016,Came here for my nephew and I birthday ;)  we enjoyed our time . Food was your typical Cheesecake Factory food :)  there is no self park at this place and valet for lunchtime $2.50  There's sitting outside and inside .. Nice view of the water.
Lesley M. C.,"Los Angeles, CA",46,163,1697,4.0,7/11/2016,Food is always great here . But it doesn't get better than the desserts.  Some are too sweet some are just prefect.
Jenni M.,"Los Angeles, CA",51,56,15,2.0,12/31/2016,"Came here for brunch Saturday to only find out they have brunch on Sunday's only.    Bloody Mary was okay. Nothing special couldn't taste the vodka. There were no olives. It was super basic with 1 celery stick.  Tuna tartar was REALLY small. My husband and I each had 2 bites and it was done. Came with 4 small tiny wontons.  Also ordered an apple juice but after not getting it for 15 minutes I was over it. She came by to ask if we needed everything and I told her to cancel the juice. She didn't seem to remember hence why we were still waiting for it.  I ordered the ""Renee lunch special"" I asked for Caesar salad as my side (it cost $1 more) but got an arugula salad.  The turkey sandwich was plain and turkey was fatty. Potato soup was really tasty. My husband got the fish tacos and they were mediocre. Rice that came with it was salty.   Other: If you sit by the window it's a nice view  Overall way overpriced for the food and drink quality."
Gennaro M.,"Hermosa Beach, Los Angeles, CA",3,9,,3.0,2/12/2017,"I come to Cheesecake Factory occasionally and we always had good time and good food.  Today the service was horrible, it took forever to have someone attention and actually I went to pick up the menu by myself.  Positive note was one of the waiter (Marcio), from another area, that after he recognize our disappointment he tried to do everything ti make it up. Finally we got the food and most of it was cold.  We called the manager and she was nice and deeply sorry for what happened.  They cut the bill taking out the cold dishes. My points was not to pay less, the dinner was ruined at that point, but I hope they understood what was wrong this night ( I saw other people complain too).  Bottom line the manager and the waiter handled the situation well and for that reason I'll give this place another chance."
Andre L.,"El Segundo, Los Angeles, CA",60,3,1,2.0,5/27/2017,Extremely long wait! Their food isn't that great to wait that long!  Problem could have been solved if they only took reservations but apparently less & less restaurants believe in reservations!   Added the 2nd start because our waitress did what she could to sweeten the sour experience!  Then to top it off the restroom was out soap at one sink and out of paper towels. So I snatched a dinner napkin off a table on the way back to my seat!
Luke L.,"San Gabriel, CA",21,1280,8757,2.0,12/10/2015,"Comparing with the Pasadena location (which I considered as 3-stars), this Cheesecake Factory had a pretty spotty service - food took forever to come and the waitress never followed up and asked about what drink I want. *** Miso Salmon (Fresh Miso Marinated Salmon Served with Snow Peas and a Delicious Miso Sauce - brown rice, $20): Quality of fish was pretty average (tasted somewhat stale) and the only decent part about this dish was sweet teriyaki sauce - basically a completely overpriced dish for the quality you are getting in return. *** Good complimentary brown bread and easy self parking (especially during weekday lunch hours), but those were the only two positive things I can think of."
Richard W.,"Torrance, CA",0,3,,3.0,11/25/2017,"You can always count on a great meal at the Cheesecake Factory, but I felt my last visit was not up to their usual greatness. The server was ok, but even after two reminders for a glass of ice and lemon for the ice tea, we never received it. Also, ordered the fettuccini Alfredo with chicken. Don't mind paying for the added chicken($4), but there was only four small pieces(bites) of chicken. Thought it was excessive. Even $2 would have been too much for so little chicken. Won't stop me for going back as there is plenty of choices, just won't add chicken again."
Chanel C.,"Gardena, CA",3,70,18,2.0,1/7/2017,Food is awful. Ordered fish tacos. Came with way too much cabbage and onion. Turned my stomach. Rice was undercooked and bland. Husband had chicken and biscuits. No gravy like traditional chicken and biscuits. Will not be returning. Food is virtually inedible.
Helen H.,"Torrance, CA",1210,106,622,4.0,11/29/2016,"Is there a cheesecake heaven? Yes, there is. You don't have to die to go there, just get yourself to the Cheesecake Factory. The name tells the truth, it us a factory. A factory of yumminess. Cheesecakes in such a wide variety of flavors, it tickles the mind. So many possibilities. Just one mouth. However can you decide? Can't help you with that one. But just reading all the cheesecakes is a marvelous thing.  But there is more, with real food that is interesting and tasty. Great appetizers and small plates, for times when you are hungry for just something small and yummy. They bring you free bread and butter. The bread changes a little, but it usually includes the dark soft squaw bread and it's yummy.  My favorite appetizer is the Stuffed Mushrooms with it's fontina and parmesan cheese, garlic and herbs in a yummy sauce. White Bean Hummus served with warm flatbread, is worth trying. The Beets With Goat Cheese is really good, made with fresh beets, apples, baby arugula, pecans and vinaigrette. The Warm Crab & Artichoke Dip is sooooooo good, and the grilled sourdough bread they serve it with is a great pairing. Yum. When I am feeling virtuous I order the Kale Salad, with cranberries, apples, marcona almonds and green beans, with a yummy buttermilk black pepper dressing. It is so yummy, it doesn't feel like diet food, it tastes like I am indulging. My friend swears by the Kobe Burger, with its American style kobe beef with sauteed mushrooms and onions on wonderful fresh bread. He says he craves it. I believe him. His face looks so blissful when he is eating it. They offer huge portions. Bang Bang Chicken is not to be missed. The Chinese Chicken Salad is yummy and enough for three meals. The Orange Chicken is the best Orange Chicken-EVER. The Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta is as interesting as it is delicious, with lots of layers of flavors and textures, with asparagus, peppers, peas, garlic, with perfectly prepared pasta and seasoning. They have seasonal favorites and such a huge menu. So many choices. Ordering always takes a long time. Always a dilemma, to try an old favorite or venture out and try something new?  Great views of the ocean and the marina. Lovely sunsets, if you time it right. They have indoor and patio seating. They have a wonderful special events rooms upstairs. They have a friendly cheerful wait staff. They have a bar and you can wait here, if you are waiting for a table. Great food, great service and predictably amazing cheese cakes and desserts. Really, if they just had the spellbinding White Chocolate Raspberry Cheesecake, I'd keep going back. It's that delicious. Don't take my word for it, go and taste it for yourself. Discover which Cheesecake captures you. Lemon Raspberry Cream Cheesecake, Dulce De Leche Caramel Cheesecake, Chocolate Coconut Cream Cheesecake,Tiramisu Cheesecake, Chocolate Mousse   Cheesecake,Vanilla Bean Cheesecake, Chocolate Tuxedo Cream Cheesecake......AH!!"
Lumburg B.,"Newport Beach, CA",2,11,2,1.0,1/7/2017,"Your restaurant forces all of its guests to valet park. Self parking is not an option. That's fine, but the valet doesn't accept credit cards and you don't have an ATM on the property. WTF.  If valet parking is mandatory, all payment options should be accepted. I've literally been driving to your restaurant and realized I didn't have cash on me and decided to eat elsewhere just because I didn't want to have to stop at an ATM on my way.  Not to mention the ATM fees your company is missing out on... Get it together."
Charly U.,"South Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",0,10,,5.0,5/16/2017,Officially my family's number one restaurant to eat at. The price is just right And the good is great. Every time i come here I order the Thai Lettuce Wraps And the nachos. Mmmmmmmmm. Yummy!  Also lets not forget about the variety of cheesecakes that you have to choose from. One downside. Sometimes the wait is a pain in the **** I wish that they could make membership cards. If they did I would gladly apply since My family and I go often. Highly recommend this restaurant.
Obiagaeli I.,"Santa Monica, CA",58,7,,4.0,9/12/2017,The service here is really great. They are usually pretty busy so you may have to wait a bit for your order. Food is up to par.
Helena C.,"Los Angeles, CA",84,56,6,5.0,5/30/2017,"Our server was great! The food was awesome. The reason I had to knock off 2 stars was because of Ashlyn. After we got some food bagged up by our server, we went to the cheesecake counter. Ashlyn greeted us and I asked her for two Oreo cheesecakes. She rung me up and handed me my receipt. I didn't give her any tip because she didn't show me why she deserved one. All she did was push a few buttons. She hadn't done anything. So when she sees she got no tip she decided to take her sweet ass time in getting said cheesecake. It took her 10 mins (I counted) for her to give us our cheesecake. Mind you, WE WERE THE ONLY INES THERE AT THE COUNTER. There was NO ONE else in line. It was about 4:30pm on 4/18/17. Just my boyfriend and I and Ashlyn. What she could have done to receive a tip was get my order, show me how quick she could get it to me and how efficiently. Instead she did the opposite. Then when I took my bag and told her thank you she gave me an eye roll. Advise to management: reprimand and retrain her. Everyone else in the restaurant was super pleasant but her. Update: after the manager of the Cheesecake Factory reached out, I have to update my review. They seemed genuinely concerned that I had poor customer service from one person. I'd hate for one person to reflect the entire store. I have now updated my rating to five stars. They definitely made up for it and know the value of customer service."
William B.,"Mid-City West, Los Angeles, CA",59,91,51,4.0,7/2/2017,"The food was great. Everything is made fresh to order. When food is good it's a little fatty, just keep that in mind."
Susan U.,"Los Angeles, CA",501,782,1965,5.0,8/27/2015,"Wowzers! The SALTED CARAMEL CHEESECAKE is to die for! Smooth,not extremely sweet,caramel on top was just great and oh,I can eat the whole slice if I wanted to.  Parking was terrible but there was valet service and because we came here for a to-go-dessert so there's a saved space for such. There was no line at the CC counter so it was fast. But for a Wednesday night,I didn't expect this place to be super packed with diners!"
Ann N.,"Torrance, CA",1,52,264,5.0,10/29/2017,"My friend and I enjoyed a wonderful dinner tonight! It's been a while since I have eaten dinner here!  Before dinner we went to the bar and had a delicious cocktail made from a sweet bartender named Axl Trias! Very upbeat and wasn't afraid to tell me what to order after I asked for his expertise drink to enjoy! He made a great cocktail and gave us great service! Will look for him again when I come back!!! We were seated and had the pleasure of having a wonderful waitress named Tatyana! She was very sweet and calm (I don't like hyper or anxious servers) she was perfect. I asked her for her personal recommendation on what to order and she was not afraid to tell me! Going with what she suggested, I ordered the CHICKEN Madeira! A Sautéed Chicken Breast Topped with Fresh Asparagus and Melted Mozzarella Cheese. Covered with Fresh Mushroom Madeira Sauce and Served with Mashed Potatoes. My friend ordered the FETTUCCINI ALFREDO! It had a  Rich Parmesan Cream Sauce. Everything was delicious and cooked perfectly! We ordered the chocolate cake and Tatyana pack it beautifully to go! If if wasn't for these two wonderful workers, I probably would not come back! Tatyana and Axl Trias Gave Outstanding, Award Winning Customer Service!!!They Rock!!!xoxo!"
Nancy C.,"Torrance, CA",21,6,,1.0,8/31/2017,So I had a birthday celebration Monday night and charged my dinner. I left my card there. Cheesecake factory put it in a safe HOWEVER now I magically have fraudulent charges two days later on my card! Cheesecake factory claims they I was cyber attached lmao! I have not been attacked online and had fraudulent charges on the card that i have had for 20 years but magically now I get attacked! no what a coincidence that is!!! I noticed the card missing Tuesday morning but didn't make the connection of leaving it. WOW - no someone copied my card before entering it at the safe! So if I were you ... you better take your card with you or USE CASH ...
Joe M.,"Rancho Palos Verdes, CA",89,85,33,5.0,6/6/2017,"We have been at this restaurant several times but I must tell you about our visit today. The food is always good but today our service was the best ever. Our server Rachel could not of been more attentive and pleasant during our lunch. She is probably the biggest asset to this restaurant and should be told so. I only wish during all of our dining out experiences that we could have servers act as professional and pleasant as Rachel. If you are lucky, you will be seated in her section."
Kristine T.,"Los Angeles, CA",483,380,3438,2.0,3/26/2016,"It's been a minute since I've been to a CF! Came here to celebrate with my parents and the hubby, only to look back and say, ""It sounded like the perfect spot at the time!"" Brunch with a view, refreshing drinks & their infamous (red velvet) cheesecakes, what can possibly go wrong?!  Well let me tell ya...pretty much, customer service was a huge let down and food was average. I had high expectations from the last time I've been but I guess I was wishful thinking. The customer service we received in San Diego was way better. It's been a while but I totally remember how exceptional they were--quick and on top of things the whole time we were there.  On our visit to this location, we arrived right at opening so the parking lot was still empty--3 to 4 cars tops. No need for the valet. We walked in and had to wait 5 minutes to be seated. Not bad. We weren't on a time crunch.  We chose to sit at the outdoor patio for the beautiful view. Just our luck, other groups had the same idea. If only I knew we were going to be stuck with ONE server and she has to serve 5 or more tables all at once, best believe I would've asked to move back inside instead. It bothered me the most but my group didn't seem to mind so much until later on. Our server forgot multiple requests we had asked her to do/bring over to the table, so we had to constantly remind her. She was multitasking okay-ish at the beginning but she could've also asked for back up.  Anyways, food was a wait as well. But that, I didn't care so much. Thankfully, they had warm breads and butter for the table as starters. We also added the avocado eggrolls as appetizers. It looked the most appealing off the menu but it was okay. I didn't like how their menu was never-ending too. IDK if that's just me. It made it so difficult to choose. Options are great but it was time-consuming. My entire group found ourselves flipping through back and forth and we kept changing our minds...basically, we had to settle. I didn't like that.  I wanted to like CF, i really did. Our experience just wasn't as great. We ordered desserts for take out and ordered at the counter. Damn, I don't remember the slices being so expensive. The ladies behind the counter wasn't as cheerful either. C'mon now, the day just started. Be happy?  It was my first and last at this CF location.  #ByeNow"
