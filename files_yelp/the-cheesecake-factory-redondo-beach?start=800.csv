Rod S.,"San Clemente, CA",0,7,,4.0,1/5/2014,Met my son there last Saturday and we were seated along the window with a  nice harbor view. The food was very good and the waitress very friendly and handled our order quickly and efficiently. Coctails are a bit expensive as well as the entrees but the view is worth it. Valet is required unless you can find a place on the street.
Jesus H.,"Los Angeles, CA",409,202,224,4.0,8/20/2010,Not a bad place nice atmosphere. The waitress was nice but disappeared for a while. The food was very good. I had the 4 cheese pasta with chicken and got nice portion. Nice view. There was no wait time to sit down. Food took a while to get to our table. Over 30 minutes. Well check this place out.

Tara E.,"Gardena, CA",24,184,3,4.0,6/19/2008,"This is the best Cheesecake Factory that I've been to. The seating time is usually short and the service is pretty good. We sometimes sit outside on the patio, which gives really good views of the harbor and boats. It can get very cold out there too and it takes them a while to get the heaters going. Of course the free bread is good, always plentiful. The best appetizer has to be the FRIED MACARONI CHEESE BALLS, if you have a chance i really recommend this! Who else has macaroni cheese in balls? It tastes really cheesy and the creamy marinara sauce goes very well! I've only really had pasta's over here and i have two favorites the Pasta Da Vinci and the Fettucini with Chicken and Sundried Tomatoes. I've never had a problem over here! And of course i have to talk about the cheesecake, my favorite has got to be the Chocolate Tuxedo, its more creamy and less chocolatey than other chocolate cheesecakes i've tried. it tastes even better with the whipped cream! Overall, we come here a lot, its a little bit more expensive but i think its worth it. portions are huge, you wont be disappointed they have a lot of selection!"
Ts W.,"Los Angeles, CA",9,9,13,2.0,7/2/2013,"We went to cheesecake factory in Redondo Beach with a group of 10 to celebrate our friends birthday on June 30th at around 8:30 pm. Our experience was by far one of the worst we have ever experienced there. Our server didn't seem very attentive to us, and took excessive amounts of time to not only take, and bring out our orders, but to also get our checks. We notified the staff that it was our friends birthday, and we were under the impression that the ""birthday cake"" brought out was supposed to be complimentary, however we were charged $7.50. (To be fair we did order a slice of cheesecake, but it was NOT intended to be for the birthday boy). We assumed they would bring something separate for him.   Our bill came out to be around $225 with added gratuity of around $31 dollars. We distinctively remember giving $188 in CASH, (This is accurate because 3 of us at the table counted the money at three completely separate times) leaving the unpaid balance of $47 to be split onto 3 credit cards. $47 split into 3 is $15.66. However each Individual Bill came out to be about $20. This simply cannot be. When we confronted our waiter and asked him how much cash we gave him, he said $168.00, which is impossible. He showed us the money, and we noticed that he only had 4 $20 bills in his hand. We KNOW FOR A FACT that there were 5 $20 bills when we handed it to him. The only explanation we can think of is that our server, put $20 into his pocket. We had no way of proving this at the time, and we were EXTREMELY annoyed at how long the entire payment process took (about 30 minutes AFTER WE GAVE OUR CREDIT CARDS AND CASH) so we didn't want to cause a scene and left. Needless to say we will NEVER be eating at your restaurant or any of your other locations EVER AGAIN. This is unacceptable, and you can expect to see this review posted on not only Yelp, but Facebook and any other social media link you guys have, so that it never happens to another customer again.   This message was written in collaboration WITH ALL of the people at our table on the 30th of June, 2013 from 8:30 pm to 10:15 pm at The cheesecake factory, Redondo Beach. To confirm the validity of this statement and all of its contents you will be receiving this same review by multiple different email addresses. Thank you."
Niima R.,"Anchorage, AK",122,28,,4.0,5/22/2011,"The food, drinks and desserts are delicious! My only complaint (and it really isn't a complaint...) is that the menu is so big that it's so hard to make a decision on what to order. I recommend the avocado eggrolls,  they are delicious. Everything is good so I can't even say what I would recommend. Please don't leave without order one or more slices of Cheesecake. They have 40 types of cheesecake. My favorite is the Keylime Pie cheesecake. Just know it's not cheap but well worth the money."
pablo p.,"Redondo Beach, CA",42,17,6,4.0,9/17/2011,The Cheesecake Factory is defiantly a great choice the service is remarkable and if your not scared to throw down some money the food is remarkably well every time.
Gracie Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,12,,4.0,6/7/2011,Out of all the Cheesecake Factorys this is my favorite one because of the location. I've eaten inside and outside but prefer inside because of the ambiance. The parking is valet and its always crowded but service and food overall is pretty good and I've never had a bad experience here.
Tae J.,"Seattle, WA",132,38,2,1.0,4/28/2008,"My friend used to work here.  I don't want to get too explicit, but let's just say that they don't exactly handle the food in a safe manner.  I'm not sure whether the management condones this, or just looks the other way... but for whatever reason, they remain intent on not doing anything about it.   Eat here if you don't mind getting sick.  Who knows, maybe you'll contract something incurable.  This branch is a lawsuit waiting to happen."
A A.,"Malibu, CA",0,13,16,1.0,10/8/2014,"the food does not taste good as usual, and the waiter/server is very unfriendly, for somehow, we did not do anything to him, but he keep giving us a long face and rude attitude...but he treats the tables around us very well...interesting!"
H M.,"Huntington Beach, CA",103,7,1,5.0,7/3/2011,"Hello, I wanted to email the coordinator of this restaurant in Redondo Beach. I was a Wedding Coordinator for a wedding at this location on June 25th.  I have worked at some of the top venues in Southern California and it is very rare that I have the pleasure of working with someone as professional as Lauren (I hope I have her name right, she did not have business cards).  When I arrived at the venue at the beginning of cocktail hour Lauren and her attentive staff had the room completely set with every detail the bride had requested. I knew that the bride had moved up her reception time, giving the venue only one hour between an earlier event, but there was no evidence of an earlier party. Lauren was very detailed and went over every aspect of the room set up with me. She then compared my timeline with hers and checked that we had the same schedules. She also verified her timeline with the photographers and DJ. She was extremely efficient and genuinely cares about all aspects of the event. The entire evening all I had to do was look up, and Lauren was there asking me if there was anything I needed. I barely had to suggest dimming the lighting, or adjusting the cake serving time and Lauren was already working on it.  I would just like to commend Lauren for a going above and beyond to make the experience at her venue perfect. She is very qualified and puts many coordinators to shame. I would highly recommend The Cheesecake Factory Redondo Beach for future events. Thank you Lauren, it was a pleasure working with you."
Marisa F.,"Hesperia, CA",122,302,14,4.0,5/1/2008,"So, I admit it. I like the cheesecake factory.  I hate cheesecake and will never eat it even if its free (though it never is free, huh?) but I enjoy the variety of the menu and the lunch specials are extra nice. Lunch: Wasabi salmon, rice and snap peas. Delicious and just the right price. This place gets so busy, its insane! I guess I'm not the only one that likes it =)"
Courtney R.,"Atlanta, GA",77,64,79,3.0,11/23/2010,"super happy they brought in a m-f happy hour 4-6  $5 apps and $5 limited drink menu (marggies, long islands, mojitos, cosmos, and jw's pink lemonade) apps are full size and some of the more popular options are on there: buffalo blast, nachos, vietnamese shrimp summer rolls, potstickers, sweet corn tamale cakes, fire roasted artichoke, guac..... there are a few others) that being said it's still the cheesecak so the food is ""ok"" and the drinks are ""ok"", but it'll get you there and get you full."
Kristine K.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,2,,1.0,7/5/2013,"The Worst Cheesecake I have ever been to. First of all the staffs were with attitudes and arrogant. Plus the plates and cups were dirty. We were not approached by anyone. Our waiter was avoiding us and we sat there for 30 minutes waiting to order our food. The place was very disorganized. Also we asked for avocado roll when we finally got the waiter's attention and asked if there was any onions in the roll especially when our friend has allergies from onions and the respond was no there is no onions. The avocado egg roll  came and sure enough there was onions. My worst experience at a restaurant. If you guys love cheesecake, go to other locations."
Patrick K.,"Torrance, CA",20,31,6,4.0,11/23/2008,"A great place to have a nice meal.  I had the chicken salad sandwich the last I went and was seated near the window overlooking the marina.  In the evenings they light the candles at each table which gives adds to the ambience.  Gives it more of a romantic feel. Ironically, I wasn't able to try the cheesecake the last time I went, but I had it there before.  But if you do have room after finishing your main course then, I'd encourage it.   4 stars 4 stars.  Great place to enjoy a meal."
Paul L.,"Irvine, CA",730,418,1098,2.0,10/26/2007,"The Cheesecake Factory just blows. Now, in saying this, I realize that I have just dissed the sacred cow of dinner date/celebration restaurants, but I cannot hold back any more. I am literally busting at the gut to let it out: the place just blows ass. For one thing, who puts ads in menus? Isn't it enough that I am about to order a tub full of food? Do I really need to be shopping for a new pool while I am at it? I guess they figure that I will need a bigger one after this meal is over. And another thing, while I personally have no problem with high concept fusion cuisine, I do have a problem with dishes that think ""fusion"" simply means a whole helluva lot of food. And what's the deal with their Thai dishes anyway? What's so Thai about the addition of carrots and peanuts? I lived in Thailand for months and never ate a carrot nor peanuts, much less together. Tonight, Joy and I popped into our local Factory to satisfy a sweet tooth we were both having. Just a little somethin' somethin' to put the day to bed. Had I known that I would still be burping 4 hours later, I would never have entered the joint. So we order the Mud Pie, a sickening combination of chocolate cake, two kinds of ice cream, hot fudge, all covered by a duvet of whipped cream. Sounds pretty good at first, eh? To be honest, it is very good.  But when you get to your twelfth spoonful and you're still not even past the first layer of cream and frosting, you start to get images of your dentist going CHA CHING! Out of frustration, we decide to eviscerate the poor sucker, just to get at some of the cake -- you know, the stuff you are actually paying for. I guess that behavior comes from my Chinese mother, who would always tell me to finish the most expensive part of a dish whenever I started to get full: ""Mom, I'm can't eat any more!"" ""Just eat the meat then, "" she would respond. After ten more mouthfuls, and two more cups of coffee, I am on the verge of exploding -- literally. My body has started to reject all the sugar I have ingested, and the coffee isn't helping any either. A quick trip to the bathroom and I have just flushed $6.95 + tax down the john. Unfortunately, I do not feel any better afterward. For all this, I blame The Cheesecake Factory. I mean, who serves a piece of cake the size of Joyce's Ulysses? Do they really expect people to eat so much food? Of course, I did not have to finish my Mud Pie, but the fact is, I tried. Am I another victim of the chubbification of America? Or is this just another example of the failures of US liberal democracy? We often perceive of America as a land of plenty, a place where freedom and opportunity abounds. If The Cheesecake Factory is emblematic of this kind of plenty, then why does it result in such excesses? We are often socialized to think that bigger is better, that more is merrier, that consumption is a sign of strength: this is an ideology that crosses over into every realm of our lives. But it is this unbridled hunger for consumer goods that is producing sweatshops in the third world, levelling rainforests at a lightning pace, and leading us into war with Iraq. We are on the verge of firing smart missles at the Middle East, all because I had a fuckin' sweet tooth. So how did I get from The Cheesecake Factory to the war in Iraq? I don't know; I blame the sugar."
Danny H.,"South San Francisco, CA",230,458,11,4.0,10/20/2010,"You're who I'm thinkin' of Girl, you ain't my runner up And no matter what You're always number one...at THE CHEESECAKE FACTORY - Justin Bieber (favorite girl) Baby baby baby oh! Was told it was going to be slow on a tuesday night, seemed pretty busy to me. We got seated quite promptly and proceeded to order the avocado egg-rolls appetizer cuz those are sooo good! (good fat too right!)  Once again, the cheesecake factory menu managed to confuse me with way too many choices and of course i took forever to choose. The specials menu didn't seem special so and i couldnt decide what to get either so found the combination section and chose the grilled salmon and beef medallions with rich mushroom sauce. It was good, although it seemed like the sauce of the salmon didn't match too well with the mushroom sauce of the beef. It doesn't matter, the red velvet cheesecake was waiting in the wings and its as good an end of the meal as the egg-rolls are at the start of the meal.  p.s. - its a 15 min walk to the pier, seems like there's sufficient parking next to it if you just wanna drive there. Food: 4 stars --- Service: 4 stars --- Atmosphere: 4.5 stars --- Price(value): n/a"
Jaime P.,"Danville, CA",222,820,6,4.0,3/25/2008,"I think I may be subconciously trying to visit The Cheesecake Factory every time I go on vacation.  My cousin, who turned 25 on Easter Sunday had never been to this chain, so I figured I'd pop his cherry. Lucky for us we were staying across the street at the Crowne Plaza Hotel,  so we just walked over instead of having to valet our car.  The wait wasn't too long, maybe 10-15 min or so. Upon getting seated, with an awesome indoor view of the pier, we got our bread and drinks very promptly.  My cousin ordered the Louisana Chicken pasta and I got the Mediterranean style mahi-mahi, both of which were bomb.  Of course I had to also mention to all our servers that it was my cuzo's birthday, just for the embarrassment factor of it all. Overall, we had a pleasant experience here, our waitress was friendly, service was prompt and I don't have any real complaints!"
Jack T.,"Torrance, CA",3,6,,4.0,9/24/2014,"love the food, so much variety to choose from, usually busy on weekends, about 20 minutes wait, but overall never had a dissapointing experiance...would recoemmend"
J. L.,"Mountain View, CA",1,47,,3.0,3/11/2008,"I can't give this place more then 3 stars... Although the factory appetizer thing was awesome, meaning not a single thing sucked in it They had what they decided to call broccoli cheese soup, but it was far from that being that it was oversaturated with red bell peppers...   ...Red bell peppers have no place in a broccoli cheese soup I would give another star for the super cheery server, but I just can't get over the red bell peppers in my soup, which made it horrible I have to add A++ for the factory appetizer thingy F for the soup And another A++ for the cheery server"
