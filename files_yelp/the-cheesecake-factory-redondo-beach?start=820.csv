Meryl G.,"Redondo Beach, CA",16,34,,5.0,6/15/2010,Love the atmosphere and looking out over the harbor.  The service and food is always on point.  I'm thinking about having our rehearsal dinner there the night before my wedding.
Candido S.,"Long Beach, CA",10,22,,5.0,5/8/2013,OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! the cheesecake Stephanie's cheesecake is the best dessert in the world. This place is amazing come here with a date and you will get major points especially during sunset which you can see trough your window. very romantic
Tobi L.,"Los Angeles, CA",54,87,228,4.0,1/17/2010,"I love this place, my favorite dish is the shrimp scampi with angel hair. The wheat bread is so good with a little bit of butter. House wine, Robert Mondavi Merlot, pretty reasonable price and good. Thai salad very good if trying to watch your weight. All of their desserts are GREAT!!!!!! Ambiance is nice and service is almost always good. This is the  place to indulge."
David V.,"Memphis, TN",3,19,,1.0,3/2/2011,I went there one evening recently.  We sat on the patio.  While waiting for our food after ordering it began to rain.  We went indoors and asked for a seat.  We had to wait several minutes for an empty while we watched other people being seated.  I expected that we would receive priority seating considering the circumstances.   I ordered the Stuffed Chicken Tortillas.  They were very dry and also a little cold.  My guess is that they were ready to serve when the rain started and sat on the counter until we were seated.  I will not go back!
Suzn L.,"Anaheim, CA",71,325,55,4.0,7/14/2007,"I really like this cheesecake factory.  It has a different feel than the others....waterfront, romantic Things to consider:  Miso Salmon, Chitty bang bang entree, love love the vanilla bean cheesecake Cheesecake factory is a good place for 2-4 people, the more people the longer the wait. The pasta and herb crusted salmon are not that great....the portions are pretty big here."
Ashley W.,"Walnut, CA",85,143,97,3.0,9/1/2008,"Good bread, nice area (better than most Cheesecake Factories), interior is pretty, and big portions. With such a large selection of food, it's no wonder the food doesn't taste so spectacular. With so many people, no wonder the servers do not spare much attention on their customers. The dessert is really good, but the way the tiramisu (tastes great)  was presented to us was in the most laughable manner because it was just a small, square, mushy looking piece of unidentifiable cake that looked nothing like a tiramisu. The strawberry shortcake is worth indulging in by the way."
Diva T.,"Costa Mesa, CA",7,14,9,2.0,12/24/2012,"Went on Saturday Dec 22, 2012, I use to love going to this location but the service was not great and the quality and quantity of the food was lacking.  I was very disappointed overall.  I gave it a 2 ** because it was horrible just not the same.  Won't be going back anymore"
Cheri A.,"Los Angeles, CA",1193,1551,3888,3.0,5/12/2007,Every month or so there is a group of us from my work that get together for lunch and every time we do we go to this Cheesecake Factory.  The location has nice outdoor seating and the place is huge.  I usually just get a salad which are decent and big enough that I can never eat the whole thing. One night I had an out of town friend with me an she wanted to come here.  We walked in and the place was packed and I asked how long was the wait and they said 2 hours.  I said are you always this busy and she said no it's Valentines Day. DUH!  I don't like Valentines Day and if my so took me out on VD I would have to shoot him so I did not even know what day it was. IF.....IF.....I DID DO THE WHOLE VALENTINES DAY THING AND MY BF TOOK ME HERE....I WOULD BE EXTREMELY INSULTED. LOSERS! BTW...I finally got my lunch group to go to Kincaids which is still a chain but better than CF.
sumi c.,"Redondo Beach, CA",17,48,4,3.0,9/11/2007,"Went yesterday (Monday) only because I couldn't think of anywhere else to get a decent salad.  It wasn't busy, but we had to valet.  The cost is creeping up:  it's now $3.25.  There's a small parking lot on the right hand side, but it was full. CAKE is known for huge salad portions, but had the the Seared Tuna Tataki Salad and this was not one of those salads.  Perfect portion.  Had 5 slices (pretty thick) of the seared tuna (lots of black pepper), small handfull of mixed baby greens with vinigrette and wasabi dressing (not bad, had it on the side, but couldn't taste the wasabi), ginger, 2 large sliced tomatos and a few slices of avocado.    Sat indoors along the windows, but no candle on the table (no need to be romantic since I was with a gf) but it was a bit dark...  They eventually turned the main lights on...  Good, I can finally see what I am eating. Service was good, he checked up on us a few times, but since we were there for 3 hrs just chatting, he eventually left us alone.  Passed on the dessert, but if I were to order a cheesecake, I would have gotten the Vanilla Bean.  *sigh*  Next time."
Ary P.,"Redondo Beach, CA",0,21,,4.0,12/26/2009,It is a great place to dine with family or friends. Fantastic deserts....
Karen K.,"Alhambra, CA",137,295,251,4.0,6/21/2010,"I had Sunday brunch here with the bf and his family. YES finally my chance to try the fried mac and cheese. That's all I wanted. We were seated right away near the back of the restaurant which was sort of considered the front when you had a little view of the marina. I of course ordered the fried mac and cheese and the bf ordered the sliders. The bf's sister in law ordered the baja burrito and his brother ordered the meat loaf. The kiddies each got there own meals too. Mmmm the waiter brings out warm bread and butter. The waiter tells us to not fill up on bread, come one who doesn't like free warm bread? Our food come out within 15 minutes and i was in heaven when my mac and cheese was put in front of me. I took a fried mac and cheese ball with a little bit of marina sauce. I took my first bit and it was gooooooooooood. I didn't get to really try everyone else's dish because i was in heaven in my own dish. It came in 4's so i got to take my other 2 home to enjoy. I think the only downside about this place is there is only valet parking."
Louis N.,"Gardena, CA",49,629,694,3.0,12/21/2007,"Good place for huge salad dishes. The chopped lettuce is fresh enough, not crisp OMG fresh but satisfying.   Pasta was good. Just not eye popping good but had volume.  Speaking of volume, what is this mountain of lettuce on the salad dishes? It was a  good shock value meal to show out of town visitors. I actually got a doggie bag for the salad that I couldn't finish.    The next day I'm staring at it thinking what the hell was I thinking?  I picked out the meats and it was alright but the lettuce was dead.   The burger was ok. Seemed smallish for the price at first but it satisfied my craving. I also had some kind of tuna wrap or roll thing and this was not bad, flavorful but a tad salty.   I came here for birthday occasions and such (in the past when I had Japanese visitors. I'd take them there and they enjoyed it, I can't hear a thing their saying due to ambiance noise but ok).   One gripe is that the place does get really NOISY during peak hours. I really wish someone would invent a noise reduction system that is effective and affordable for restaurants to use some day. Get a hearing aid? Did you say get a hearing aid? Wait, don't go...."
Brandon P.,"Los Angeles, CA",18,14,,5.0,10/17/2009,"Ok what more can i say about this place besides that its five star resturant i mean u can go here after before work, I love the drink the mojito was introduce to me right there which was righteous, the cheese cake man u gotta have the peacan cheese cake that shit was the bomb the food was great i love the buffalo wings i always get some to go, But overall Cheese cake factory is the shit"
Brian L.,"Seal Beach, CA",0,4,,1.0,1/21/2013,"First off, let me start by saying that I live down the street.  I walk here, and I come here fairly regularly.  They have a great happy hour and, until now, I was regularly bringing business partners and employees here for team building meetings.   Tonight I came with my girlfriend to blow off some steam, grab a drink and a decent meal.  When we arrived (around 6:15) they said there was a 10 minute wait.  No big deal, we went to the bar and grabbed a drink and our table was ready after the first sip.  We had a nice table by the window looking into the harbor and my girlfriend sits down and puts her hand down to scoot into the booth where there was broken glass which stuck her hand.  Being a nurse she immediately went to the bathroom to remove the glass and clean the wound.  While she was in the bathroom I explained what happened to the bus boy who immediately wiped the booth down and let the manager know.  Amanda, the manager, came by our table and said she was told there was a problem.  We let her know what happened and that my girlfriend needed a band-aid.  She brought by alcohol cleaning swabs, antibiotic ointment and a bandage, which was helpful.  We let it all go without a fuss because we figured they would at least comp our $6.95 appetizer, or if we're lucky, the next round of drinks we got to try to forget the situation.  Either of which would have been sufficient.   Then our entrées came.   I was having the southwest chicken sandwich and she had the turkey avocado sandwich.  I enjoyed the sandwich... until I bit into an irregular piece of red onion.  It still had the outer husk attached.  The next bite the same.  I opened the sandwich and checked for any remaining onion husk, which there was none.  Two minutes later my girlfriend pulls a foot long hair out of her sandwich.  That is the third strike.  Me, being a business owner, wanted to go into full on hulk mode on management but my girlfriend, being extremely non-confrontational , insisted we were already being comped for her being lacerated in the booth so we should just let it go and ignore the other mishaps.  I reluctantly agree, until the bill shows up.  FULL PRICE!!!!  After drawing blood, pulling hair out of food and chomping on husky onions we get slapped in the face with full retail.  To throw salt on the wound (yes, pun intended), while we were sitting there baffled at the check, Amanda, the manager, comes by and says ""Thanks, have a nice night"".  I figured saying anything to her wasn't doing anything so instead now you are here reading this rant."
new york r.,"Lancaster, CA",34,21,17,4.0,1/6/2013,"was out visiting family and went here for a late night snack on friday night around 6:00 p.m. got a table within 5 mins, we sat outside on the patio overlooking the harbor, thought it would be cold but the heaters they had set up keeped us all plenty warm, it was a beautiful night the boats had christmas lights on and the patio had lights wrapped around the trees. first we order the hot caramel apple cider drink a must have !!   we got   the fire roasted artichoke somewhat like the ones they have at black angus, they weren't the large artichokes but still sufficient for 3 people with 2 dipping sauces great flavor. next  we tried the basil and tomato thin pizza good size for 2 people  or to share as an appetizer for 4 can't remember it there were 6 or 8 slices loved the crust. all the bread and butter you want,  they gave us 3 diffent types of bread in the basket to choose from.  last and least the truffle chocolate cheesecake, what can I say, you can't go wrong with cheesecake! we just order 1 item at a time and enjoyed the scenery, food and conversation. I have to say that our waiter really made our night being very attentive and having a great personality, he had to take a break and we had another waiter who was no where as good as DARYL.  If you ever go here request to be seated in his area, he will make your experience better.   4 cider drinks fire roasted artichoke basil and tomato pizza  truffle chocolate cheesecake bread and butter  $48.00  for 4 people"
Cathryn T.,"Long Beach, CA",0,7,,4.0,2/22/2011,"I just recently ate here and i had the salmon. IT WAS AMAZING, the best i think i might have ever had. The service was ok, the server was a little weird and kinda seemed like a serial killer, but besides the fact the food was cooked to perfection and for being such a big place tasted home made. I did have a cheesecake slice (macadamia Carmel)  and it was really dry, i needed a glass of milk with it. Other then that it would have got 5 stars."
Dave A.,"Hermosa Beach, CA",343,17,3,4.0,7/1/2010,This place is great. The patio is the place to sit. All of the food is really good and healthy portions. The cheesecake is great.
Stephanie V.,"Huntington Beach, CA",1,14,,5.0,12/3/2012,"We had our wedding at The Cheesecake Factory in Redondo Beach this past weekend. It was a great day! Jackie the coordinator was helpful, flexible, and friendly throughout the whole process. She responded promptly to emails, as did Addie. The day of the event the staff even helped when a family member forgot to bring table numbers. The staff created some for us that matched our theme. The service was excellent! the staff brought a special plate of appetizers to our table because we came in late to the cocktail hour. The guests loved the food, and Lauren, the coordinator for the night, made sure that my fiance and I had plenty to eat. and drink  I would recommend this venue to anyone for a wedding and/or special occasion. It was affordable, easy to plan, and the food was great!"
Andrea D.,"Eugene, OR",55,227,20,2.0,8/20/2007,"I got some bug up my butt one night to go to the Cheesecake Factory for dinner.  I have no idea why, since I'd only been there once (like seven years ago) and don't really remember it being good or bad.  I think I just like the name and the potential for greatness that the name holds.  I mean, a factory that makes cheesecake?  Glorious. So we get there and it's jam-packed full of people and the wait was going to be at least an hour.  I would have loved to have waited outside since I get a little crazy around too many people, but it was February and freezing.  So we found a little ledge  to sit on while we waited near the restrooms and bakery display.   I noticed that there was a party rockin' the house in the banquet room on the second floor.  A few minutes later, the bride and groom from the reception came down and headed towards us.  I assumed they needed to use the restroom.  But then I realized that they were looking up.  Looking up at their photographer who was still up on the second floor balcony taking pictures.  He snapped a few frames of them standing in front of the entrance to the restrooms and he then came downstairs.  He then started snapping pictures of the bride and groom looking dreamy-eyed, not at each other....into the bakery display.   Now, I'm not married and I'm not a wedding photographer, but why would you want your wedding photos taken in front of the bakery section at the Cheesecake Factory?  Sure, it's cheesecake, but is it really that good? The whole scene was ridiculous (and it got worse when he had the bride piggyback the groom on the stairwell).  But it made the time waiting fly by because I could not stop laughing. When we finally were seated and had our food, I was highly disappointed that I had waited an hour for luke warm Nothing Special.  And my margarita was as expensive as the boy's meal.   At least the cheesecake was good.  Not worth commemorating with a photograph, but good."
moda i.,"Lawndale, CA",487,3,5,5.0,1/10/2011,"Love the patio, drinks and appetizers-if you want to take a friend to relax on a nice patio cheesecake factory at this location is the spot."
