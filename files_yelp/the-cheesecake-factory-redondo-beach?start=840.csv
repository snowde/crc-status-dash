Steven T.,"Orange County, CA",366,467,1211,2.0,2/21/2008,"Star for location and view from patio Star for the free bread, especially the dark one that no one truly knows what it is... even the workers.  Do not... and I repeat DO NOT order the Thai linguine.  Well, that is unless you like linguine with a jar of peanut butter poured on your plate as a sauce. I gave up Thai food for a whole month because of Cheesecake Factory, a$$es. Cheesecakes are so so, you would expect better from somewhere called the ""Cheesecake Factory."" oh, and you cant even park your own car here, can everyone say mandatory valet? Unless you ride a motorcycle then you are an exception SUCKAAAAA."
joe j.,"Torrance, CA",32,170,17,3.0,3/27/2010,"service is usually 5 stars food is usually 5 stars- or theyll fix it. the wait and crammed center tables kill this place. fixes?  free parking, sound proofing so you can have a conversation, more booths, better heaters on the patio- and you'll get a 5 star rating. Best chicken hash brunch I've ever had.  Pricey, but awesome."
Lena and Nick T.,"Los Angeles, CA",7,22,,4.0,6/21/2008,"This particular location of Cheesecake Factory is my favorite- sit out in the patio on a nice day and voila! You realize you're coming for the view and location, because it's next to the harbor and within walking distance of Redondo Pier.   So being the creature of habit that I am, I get the same exact thing everytime-  the chinese chicken salad.  I can't get enough of it.  Everything else tastes poor-mediocre, but this salad is my absolute FAVORITE.  The dressing is a sweet thick sauce not typical of asian salads, and I love picking at the wanton crisps.  It's a challenge to eat,  though, so be careful who you're with because you don't want to be a mess in front of someone you need to impress! I think Nick got the philly cheesesteak burger/sandwich, and he didn't like it and seemed disappointed.  I'm telling you, just stick with the chinese chicken salad- it's great every time!"
Gerald O.,"Redondo Beach, CA",6,99,,2.0,12/24/2012,"I am giving this restaurant which operates like a factory two stars only because their servers were so good, the food however is another story.  My husband and I shared the entrée size pear and endive salad on the skinnylicious menu and it was tasteless. The seating is so crowded together and the noise level is unbearable. However when we left the line was going out the door which I completely do not understand"
Zelda C.,"Manhattan Beach, CA",21,19,,1.0,7/28/2012,"Been going to this cheesecake factory for over ten years and it has always been a great experience.  Had lots of take out from this location and each and every time it has been spot on.  Don't know what happened but WOW what a disappointment and what lack luster service.  I tried to order shishito peppers two kinds no longer on the menu.  Thai pasta overcooked pasta a tablespoon of the peanut sauce so it was totally dried up.  The thousand island dressing in the mason jar was tangy and tasted old, The blue cheese dressing just wasn't consistent with the dressing I had purchased many times before and the bread was okay but in fact it was the best part of my order.  The cheesecake was a let down for the first time red velvet and godiva with the cream.  Is it unqualified staff that gets it wrong, uncaring rushing staffers as they are busy and figure one less customer so what?  I don't know but the overall experience was really not good so I won't go back and I don't think they care as they just aren't trying anymore. Sad"
Rita A.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,357,83,2.0,10/25/2009,"Had a first date here.  Dinner was good and as usual the salads are huge.  Nice first meeting, good conversation, cutie with a sexy bald head.  The night was going good until I had to go the ladies room.  I was filthy!  It was so dirty I did not even want to do the hover above bowl.  This was the one time I wish I were a guy with outdoor plumbing.  They lose a star for the bathroom."
Julie L.,"Chatsworth, CA",102,16,4,1.0,5/17/2010,"This was the first time I had been to cheesecake factory. The waiter took 15 minutes (seriously I watched the clock on my phone) to come take our drink order, and then took an additional 30 minutes to bring them to us. Ordered the food with our drinks, and that took 55 minutes. We did not order anything that complicated. We arrived @ 9:45pm and didn't leave until 12:45am. And believe me, it wasn't by choice."
Ali E.,"Torrance, CA",233,66,20,5.0,4/4/2007,"You can't go wrong with Cheesecake Factory - this is one of very few restaurants that has yet to disappoint me - I love the food - the service is great and after a weekend of going nothing is better than a Sunday brunch at Cheesecake. I get more and more daring each time I go - I have ordered everything from the 36 Hour Ribeye and Herb Crusted Salmon to the Bulgarian Beef Goulash and The Factory Meatloaf - Everything is delicious. For appetizers try the Avocado Eggroles, Fired Calamari and the Mini Sliders - For a meal try the Herb Crusted Salmon, Stake Diane, 36 hour Ribeye and the Louisiana Chicken Pasta. Also try some of the cheesecake if you want a healthy desert try the 6 Carb cheesecake - it is very light and not too rich ____________________ By: Ali E"

Beth m.,"Redondo Beach, CA",0,9,1,1.0,6/25/2011,"I took a friend from out of town there for a birthday dinner. Our waiters name was Julio, he gave us the worst experience. First of all, we waited forever to get even a water. We had bread on the table and we were ordering appetizers before water came. Alsowhile ordering he walked away, so that we had to call him back so we could finish. Then, my friend who I was treating to dinner, has an allergy to nuts. She told him so that he could provide her a different sauce for her appetizer. When she ordered her main course he neglected to tell her it also contained nuts. Thankfully she asked the girl who brought our plates, and found this information. Then, I know that for birthdays the restaurant usually provides a dessert, and the employees sing. And even though we informed him it was her birthday at the start, no such service was offered. When I paid the bill, I did NOT believe that Julio deserved a large tip from me. I left what I thought he deserved. I guess he thought he deserved more because when we were walking to my car, Julio follows us outside, calling that I forgot to sign the receipt. I walked back to sign, when he yelled that my tip was disrespectful and he did not want it. He tried to throw the money at me. I couldn't believe what I was hearing! I told him to keep it. Then I asked for his managers name, which he was very hesitant to give me.  Honestly, I never want to go back to that place again. I can't believe that I would be treated that way when I was paying good money to eat out. Go there if you want to get crappy service with a side of embarrassment."
Ron P.,"Norwalk, CA",23,69,50,5.0,10/4/2009,"I've been coming here for years and this place never dissapoints!  The food is the bomb!  Never had a bad meal and the service is always good.  They don't take reservations and on weekends it's always packed.  If you're coming here to celebrate a birthday, expect to wait a while.    The Chicken Madera is my favorite item on the menu.  Cheese, grease and gravy, I'm all over it!"
Sina N.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,7,,1.0,7/30/2010,WORST SERVICE EVER IMAGINABLE!! Believe me I've been to many of these...and the location is great..but let's just break down why u ONLY order take out from this locale... A. Drinks and app for 3 takes 25 minutes B. Get carded...three times! Then interrogated by manager C. My meal didn't even make it to the table until my friends were done...I ordered salad. D. No silverware or plates until we asked E. No condolences front mgr for poor service F. Awful bloodys on a nice summer day... Totally unacceptable. 2nd time this has happened.
Dia P.,"Windsor Hills, CA",33,40,27,4.0,11/4/2009,"i like this Cheesecake factory, i thought nothing was wrong with it, but it's fishy smell, but that's only when you're on the outside. but of course it would smell like that because it is next to water. but my overall experience with this place is Great! i love all Cheesecake factory's. i think that it is a great place to eat and dine. Cheesecake Factory is always my #1 choice.  :)"
Curt A.,"Summerfield, NC",7,61,5,4.0,1/31/2009,"Ditto... extensive menu and great food. Basically just pick anything. We went to this location to meet a family friend who was in town on business. Since it was business, this was a Wednesday night. It is an unfortunate sign of the times when you can go to a Cheesecake factory on any night of the week and NOT have a wait at 7pm. That being said, we got a great table with a view of the harbor... ok so it was night and the harbor isn't all that well lit, so it doesn't mean that much... but we did have a great view of the lightening that evening! Our wait staff... trainee and trainer... were both excellent and kept checking back to see if we were ready to order without being intrusive. It does take forever to figure out what you want. And they did keep the drinks and bread coming. Anyway we had a great evening: the company was excellent, the food was very good, and the dessert was excellent... what did we have? What else, cheesecake!"
Michael L.,"Anaheim, CA",18,59,1,5.0,1/23/2009,"I ordered Hibachi Steak (medium), boy was that good. The meat is so tender and the seasoning was good too. I have never tasted that kind of sauce on any other steakhouse. Service was very well and also the view too. Portion of meal was big."
Tyson L.,"Anaheim, CA",0,304,95,3.0,11/13/2008,"its cheesecake factory...  like it or hate it. the food is going to be the same as every other location. the only extraordinary point of this location is the outdoor seating.  with the high glass, alongside the boat docks, it makes for a decent atmosphere.  ive never bothered to eat inside, it looks as dim and ordinary and probably loud as every other C.F.  its totally different outside, in fact good for a decent date spot. just ask to be seated outside, and under a heat lamp. and dont bother with valet.  avoid the valet line and just park to the right, there should be some spots open past the reserved take out parking spots."
sonny s.,"Torrance, CA",1,37,2,5.0,12/22/2011,"ok i cant complain about anything! the food is top notch and the view is gorgeous, and definately the cheesecake is grrreat! and it may look like a high class joint and all but the prices are pretty good. figure 2 people $50 bucks with the tip. not bad ;) oh and dont forget to tip the valet guys."
MIKE B.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",27,38,,5.0,11/8/2009,"Me and my family really love this chain.  It really does not get any better than this restaurant for quality and variety.  I usually tell diners to choose only from 2 or 3 items on the menu of most restaurants to avoid disappointment, but CCF is an exception to my rule. I have eaten countless dishes on their menu and been pleasantly surprised with the wonderful meals each time. However, I would be shortchanging new diners if I did not mention what I love most on their menu which includes: Cajun Jambalaya Pasta-unbelievable Crusted Chicken Romano-again YUM Cajun Chicken Littles-Best chicken fingers on the planet BBQ Ribs-OMG great! Renee's Special-Soup,Salad,Sandwich-have it on Saturday with the Chicken soup(Sat Only) and your soul will thank you. Pizza-great Steaks-surprisingly great! You can't go wrong with the great food, huge portions, and the beautiful space you are eating within. The service is usually really good too, however I have had a few bums as servers.  The good thing is the manager has comped us completely on those occasions. This place is a real winner, eat there as much as possible, we do!"
Alan S.,"Los Angeles, CA",1633,172,38,3.0,7/29/2008,"Cheesecake is about the same everywhere you go.  Overcrowded and poor service, at least the bread fills you up while you wait way too long for a calorie loaded meal."
