Tom H.,"Torrance, CA",51,399,8,4.0,5/21/2009,"The thing that amazes me most with Cheesecake Factory is the size of their menu.  I haven't worked in the restaurant industry before but I know that the smaller the menu the more efficient the restaurant usually is.  In terms of the Cheesecake Factory's menu, the thing is huge with enough choices to fit anyone's cravings.  I just recently went here for Sunday Brunch for the first time after hitting this place for dinner numerous times and I was pleasantly surprised.  The Baja Chicken Hash was to die for and I don't think I ate for the rest of the day.  Dinner wise, you can't go wrong with the avocado eggrolls or the Thai chicken lettuce wraps as appetizers.  I usually stick to the pasta menu for dinner and I haven't tried anything I didn't like.  I only wish this place accepted reservations on weekends but on the plus side the bar service is always great.  If you can, skip the valet and park on the street during Sunday brunch times."
Min L.,"Torrance, CA",123,48,,2.0,9/6/2008,"Why do people wait nearly an hour to eat here? I don't get it. My ex co-workers and I come here everytime we meet.   I'm not sure why. Probably because we all live pretty close by.   Their menu is HUGE and has advertisements...(?)  If i end up choosing something on the menu, I flip the page and pick something else.  This goes on for about ten minutes or so until I'm so hungry I just pick my fallback-the seared ahi steak with wasabi potatoes.   Sometimes, it tastes decent.  Sometimes, the steak isn't just seared. It's more like giant block of hard tuna that resembles canned kitty food.  I guess they forget and leave it on the pan too long. Don't ever get the Jambalaya Pasta.  Tastes like salt.  Literally, the pasta is so salted, you can't taste a thing.  I once tried it with rice to avoid the pasta (can't get it unsalted), and it was bland.  No flavor. No nothing. I do, however, like their Luau salad and their Fried Mac n Cheese.  Then again, I love fried anything and even the Luau salad has fried wonton bits. Tip:  You don't have to valet.  Left side is valet.  If you turn to the right, it's self parking which usually has tons of space because everyone is tricked into valet parking. One more thing...  Did you know they have a weight management menu?  Why can't they call it something less embarrassing?  ""Yes, I'd like the weight management chicken please."""
Ajah Y.,"Long Beach, CA",26,5,,3.0,9/7/2009,"This particular CCF was the setting for my 21st birthday dinner. I had been to CCF only one other time....5 years ago when I lived in Sacramento, so I was a little apprehensive about going back since I couldn't remember the food. But one thing kept me going...the 5 words that could bring a nation to its knees.... White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle Cheesecake. When I got there with my family, we were seated about 2-3 minutes after we got there and we sat next to a window overlooking the water, which was cool (and also what my mother requested). For those who have never been to this restaurant, be prepared: the menu's like a book. A book you NEVER want to stop reading. My family had never been and they took FOREVER to order (that's my opinion, but maybe I just wanted to get to the cheesecake) but at least they were nice about it. Or so I thought. When we ordered a second round of drinks for everyone 3 out of the 5 of us had SOMETHING (we didn't know what) in our glasses. Ew. It was quickly rectified. Service was fairly speedy for what we ordered and the amount of food we had. We ordered cheesecakes without a problem (of course I got the birthday song/candle deal with mine), but few, if any, of their specialty cheesecakes come in the 6-7 inch whole pie size. My grandmother had a hell of a time trying to find one for my uncle.  All in all? Not a BAD location, but I prefer the Huntington Beach location."
Mel C.,"San Diego, CA",136,622,,4.0,4/16/2009,"Came here with visiting relatives and had a great late lunch. We sat outside to enjoy the sun, but it was a pretty cold day.  My uncle got the bang bang chicken, I got the special mahi mahi Mediterranean, and my aunt and cousin shared the Tons of fun burger. The food came out pretty quickly- the entrees are huge! I really enjoyed my mahi mahi- it was like eating bruschetta and fish. The bang bang chicken had shrimp and coconut in it and was like a very sweet curry. All of us were so full by the end of the meal, but wanted to try the cheesecake. We decided on the tiramisu and I think that was my favorite one I've tried on the menu so far. Cheesecake factory is always a safe bet when bringing visitors out to eat."
Paul K.,"Manhattan Beach, CA",126,9,,4.0,10/29/2009,Truly a great place for ambience and good food. Servers were great and prompt with the food. Hostess seated us right away! I would definitely recommend this place.
Jason U.,"Portland, ME",4,19,,4.0,1/6/2009,"If you have guests visiting you cant go wrong at any of the Cheesecake factory's. however this is my local one which I frequent alot. The best menu anywhere , good portions [ for lunch the next day ]. The Cheesecake is great. appetizers, get the avocado egg rolls, and buy some of the dip to go. its great with any appetizers. Main course. Cajun Jambalaya never fails me, nor do the pork chops, nor do the Sliders, nor does the chicken Marsala. Just go to any of them its all good. Mind you the Redondo beach branch is starting to smell a little mildewy. but hey its an old building next to the ocean."
I I.,"Costa Mesa, CA",0,330,,3.0,10/17/2009,Service here was real nice.  You have to valet your car.  I have been to numerous Cheeseback Factories and this one was just as good as the others.
Mae S.,"Torrance, CA",14,94,1,4.0,2/15/2009,"Been here one too many times.  It's a nice place to go when you want AMBIENCE.  It is kinda pricey though.  I can honestly say I have not gotten past the Asian Lettuce Wrap.  I love the drinks though.  There was one drink that I had that was HUGE and OH SO GOOD.  Bad when you are trying to avoid sweeets.  They helped me embarrass my friend by singing HAPPY BIRTHDAY to her.  She didn't see it comming (it was pay back).  Boy I hope she forgot about that day.  But, other then that nice friendly waitresses.  Hard to find sometimes but, nice."
WENNIE L.,"Redondo Beach, CA",46,35,76,4.0,2/11/2009,"Food is mediocre, but I only go there for desserts, which are awesome.  My favorite is the Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake (to die for), Tiramisu and Chocolate Tower Truffle Cake.  This location has a nice view of the marina."
M M.,"Redondo Beach, CA",0,28,2,2.0,4/10/2011,"Food quality is inconsistent.  On one visit the Luau salad was fantastic, the next visit it was absolutely gross with soggy greens.  My other gripe is the unnecessary valet service (fee plus tip). There is ample parking but they force you to use the valet. On my last visit it was pouring rain.  When we came out of the restaurant we had to stand in blowing rain at the valet stand and when our cars finally arrived all of them were completely soaked on the drivers side. Why? Because the valets were sopping wet, clothes and all, and getting into our cars without giving it a second thought. Hell, they might as well have dumped a bucket of water on my seat. It all soaked  into my clothes on the drive home. Some friends had to drive back to the OC completely soaked.  If the valet hadn't been there sure we would have gotten a little wet running to our cars, but we would have been able to get into a dry car with dry seats."
Julie D.,"Torrance, CA",4,147,65,4.0,6/24/2009,On the one hand I love eating outside but the service is a lot slower there so I tend to gage it on how hungry I am.  The food is always consistent and where else are you going to get that many options for Cheesecake?  It can get crazy on the weekends but you're usually good to go if you venture in to eat a late lunch after 2 PM...
Julie S.,"Manhattan Beach, CA",15,112,,3.0,12/27/2006,"I had Sunday Brunch here about a month ago.  We had about a ten minute wait for a table.  So, we took a lovely stroll along the Marina behind the restaurant.  It was really nice! We could see little crabs in the water, a couple of fish and lots of nice boats.  We ended up being seated on the outside patio.  It was a beautiful day!  The food was good.  Cheesecake food is pretty consistant.  One detail I appreciated was the waitress knew we were splitting a smoothie.  Instead of bringing one smoothie and an empty glass for us to split it.........They split it for us in smaller glasses and completed both with the fruit garnish.  Nice touch!"
Anthony T.,"Seattle, WA",33,69,21,4.0,2/2/2011,"i love this place, from the appetizer menu to there dessert menu everything is fabulous!!!"
lady gagay f.,"Fremont, CA",4,57,44,4.0,4/18/2008,"This used to be the best cheesecake factory that I've been to so far. We went here Friday night and I was expecting that the wait is at least 2 hours, like SF. But as soon as we arrived we were seated right away. I liked the outdoor seats over looking at the water, it is very romantic at night. The only comment that I have is that you have to spend money for parking."
Lawrence F.,"Carson, CA",59,295,1,3.0,10/13/2006,"As chain restaurants go, this one is pretty good. WAY too dark for my tastes though. I recommend the fried mac & cheese appetizers, and the chicken madiera or steak diane for entrees."
Krissy W.,"Los Angeles, CA",308,126,1,2.0,2/19/2008,"::Le sigh:: Ohh Cheesecake Factory, why has thou forsaken me? You used to be a really good chain -- bold, innovative, fun. But after 10 years plus of sameness, you're stagnant, boring, and assholes for allowing a ridiculously unnecessary valet outfit to camp out in your parking lot for the rate of $4 before tip. I give extra credit to our waitress at this location (Shanelle), who was very patient with me and my Vegan questions. She even had another waitress (a supposed vegan) come over to explain my options to me.  But that's where my compliments end, sadly. Firstly, HOW FREAKIN' LONG does it take to throw together the following simple dishes: 2 pastas, a lunch pizza and salad, and nachos. I mean really, HOW LONG?! Our table went through at least 3 rounds of diet coke and sprite whilst we waited and wasted away. And then it came. Nachos w/o much cheese, pizza oozing in grease, pasta with a soupy-cheese sauce on the side (even though my friend made a clear point of asking ""is the 4-cheese pasta consisting of grated cheeses or a cheesy *sauce?* 'Cause if it's the latter then I definitely do not want it""), and my order of Evelyn's Favorite Pasta which came absolutely *swimming* in a vat of oil. Ugh, disgusting. The amount of oil was so profuse it actually made the penne somewhat melt/ fall apart when it hit my mouth. Fast forward to Kim and I sending back our less-than-palatable lunches, followed by a 15-minute wait whilst the kitchen replaced our orders with something edible. All in all, everyone was underwhelmed.  And we got a parking ticket because our meter expired across the street. On a Sunday. In a holiday weekend. Ridiculous."
Jenna S.,"Redondo Beach, CA",81,46,4,5.0,9/17/2006,I have yet to have a bad meal at this place.  I absolutely love it!  Try the avacado egg rolls as an appetizer...they are amazing.  I also love the four cheese pasta among other things.  Oh...and if you go you have to get a slice of cheesecake...MMM...
Marco B.,"Redondo Beach, CA",6,85,,4.0,5/26/2010,"people talk crap about this place but i actually enjoy the food. large portions, great variety and not that expensive for the amount and quality of food. servers are all wearing white and boggled how they dont spill a tomato basil soup or sometype of bisk all over. cheesecake will start you off as a precursor for a nice diabetes kick and clog your shoot like santa clause stuck in a goddamn chimney"
Midori G.,"Alameda, CA",31,178,,4.0,7/19/2006,"Too loud and a little gaudy (like every other Cheesecake factory), so it gets minus one. Most other locations would only get a 2 or 3 from me, but this is the first Cheesecake Factory I ever went to and it's still my favorite because of the location. The variety of cheesecakes they have in commendable, but their plain cheesecake with strawberry sauce falls heavy and the sauce is not fresh at all, so it's official that they are not using the best quality ingredients. Not a place to go with too many people, else your order will take for over. Stick with appetizers, salads and dessert and you won't leave feeling like you gained ten pounds."
Jody S.,"Sacramento, CA",9,1326,,4.0,7/4/2009,Very good chicken romano ask for extra sauce. Outdoor patio too.
