Carrie C.,"Los Angeles, CA",98,107,,4.0,3/21/2006,"Great atmosphere.  Find a few items that you like on the menu and stick with it...although, nothing has tasted terrible as of yet.  It's just that the menu's so big that you're oftentimes at a loss as to what to order if you don't know what you like.  :)  Dessert?  Well, what can I say?  You can't go wrong with any type of cheesecake here!  On busy nights, seat yourself at the bar and enjoy the service there.  VALET (at any Cheesecake that you go to).  It's the rule, not the exception.  They seem to always be located in locations with less than stellar parking options.  :)"
Scott B.,"Austin, TX",64,106,5,2.0,8/17/2006,"I've been to a lot of Cheesecake Factories, and like the chain.  That said, the food at this one never seems quite as good as the others.  Also, the parking is a pain in the ass."
MaryJo N.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,28,4,4.0,2/22/2011,Great place. Normally we go to the Cheesecake Factory at the Gardenwalk in Anaheim but we tried a new one. It was a busy night being the day before Valentine's day so the one hour wait was acceptable. While we waited we had a few drinks and appetizers at the outside patio waiting area. Before we knew it our table was ready. Amazing view of the sunset. The only problem I had which was quickly remedied was that when I ordered my plate and tried it one of the pieces of chicken tasted spoiled. I immediately brought it to the servers attention and it was quickly taken care of. I had another order brought out what seem like two seconds later and I was not even charged for that meal. The service excellent and food as always AMAZING.
Kelly T.,"Newport Beach, CA",19,85,,3.0,5/2/2007,"Somebody please, kill me now!  This is the most over-rated restaurant I can think of.  The only reason I give it three stars is because sitting on the patio overlooking the marina really is quite pleasant.  And I like the herbed chicken club, so sue me.  Still, you won't see me going there anytime soon."
Soo K.,"Torrance, CA",61,273,8,3.0,8/1/2007,"Mediocre food but I love the appetizers and cheesecake!  Wait staff is a hit or miss.  Great for a late night meal on Saturday nights, they're open until midnight or something."
Quinton R.,"Northridge, CA",0,1,,1.0,7/29/2008,"I took my girlfriend to the cheesecake factory hoping for a pleasant dining experience.  We first ordered drinks which were overpriced and undersized and then proceeded to order dinner which wasn't that satisfactory.   While we were eating we noticed the mashed potatoes weren't that hot but decided to not worry about it.  After we arrived home both of us had to use the bathroom. These frequent visits to the bathroom continued for days.   So in order to spare you the details and to cut a long story short, we both were down with Staphylococcus aureus food poisoning.  This was most likely due to the Cheesecake factory cooks leaving food outside while they were preparing our plates.  So I would advice you against going to the cheesecake factory and if you are a cheesecake-addict and can't stay away please make sure you check your food to see if the temperature is high enough."
Stephen V.,"Torrance, CA",0,35,,3.0,2/9/2012,"really good food, service good...but what gets to me is the parking where you're supposed to have choice of valet or self parking. the lot was huge but the self parking area was sooo small as compared to the valet area and like it was you had no choice. is this a money making scheme because everyone was getting in on it including security. i like the food but then again i don't like strange thug like people touching my car...i'll pass on this place next time. there's always joe's crab shack and elephant bar, outbacks and lucille's in torrance."
Aly L.,"Chandler, AZ",510,749,8,3.0,12/9/2006,"its not spectacular... its not horrible. what else can i say about this middle of the road eatery? it has some consistent dishes that you know you can always count on to fill you up and you won't spit it out. the drinks are lackluster and highly suggest you do not ever order a blended margarita from this place. they make it like a 7-11 slushie without the goodness. how you can screw up a margarita is beyond me, but somehow they have perfected that process. still, the cheesecake factory is an ok place to go when your friends can't make such simple decisions as ""where do we want to eat tonight?""."
jackie c.,"Inglewood, CA",3,37,3,4.0,3/22/2009,"I've been coming to this cheesecake factory since I can remember and I don't get tired of it. I like coming here for any occasion. I mean I dont come too often but once in a while. A casual saturday dinner, a lunch on a warm day, to chat and have appetizers and a couple drinks, to catch up and have some coffee or tea with cheesecake, to celebrate a bday, etc. you get the picture. Cheesecake factory is a moderately pricey restaurant. I love coming here because they have always had good service and they have a huge selection of appetizers, entrees, and dessert (cheesecake). It's great to come here for dinner or lunch ( I have not came for brunch). Both inside and outside patio have nice ambiance(very calm and happy). They have patio heaters but it can get chilly and windy so if you opt for outside bring a sweater just in case. The avocado egg rolls and crispy crab wontons are yummy appetizers. I've tried different entrees but usually end up having the lemon-herb roasted chicken, its so moist and flavorful with just the right amount of lemony tang. The carrots and mashed potato match the chicken perfectly. For cheesecake my favorites are white chocolate raspberry truffle and white chocolate caramel macadamia. BOMB. Oh yah and make sure you have enough cash to cover the $3.50 valet charge and tip."
Rix G.,"Redondo Beach, CA",41,66,21,3.0,11/3/2007,"when it's busy make sure to call for a reservation. they only take reservations 11:30am-5pm. luckily we went down and got a table right away. it was even a window side table where it overlooks the harbor. food was pretty good, big portions. the atmosphere is a bit noisy and it's a big restaurant so sometimes you get lost in the shuffle. overall a decent place to go, especially when you have a cheesecake gift card to use up!"
