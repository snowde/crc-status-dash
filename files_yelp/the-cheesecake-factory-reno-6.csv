April V.,"Reno, NV",18,72,177,4.0,1/1/2018,"We were very surprised to see how many vegan options The Cheesecake Factory has today! I had the veggie burger made with brown rice, farro, mushrooms, black beans, and onion, served with lettuce, tomato, pickles and onion. If you omit the cheese and the mayo the burger is 100% vegan. I also had this served protein style (wrapped in lettuce) and a salad on the side, just to get in my extra veggies for the day.  My husband had a small Greek salad sans cheese and the avocado toast! All vegan!  Great option if you are a veg head and others are not.  Service was okay today, our server had no idea what ingredients were in our food and had to go back to the kitchen a few times but we figured it all out in the end. I wish this restaurant had an allergy menu, or informed the crew on dairy free options but all in all it worked out."
Michelle H.,"Reno, NV",384,107,138,3.0,12/21/2017,"I've been to this location about 4 times now.  And my lack of two stars, is not for the food.  The food is always really delicious, and I for sure ate WAY too much. I loved seeing that they offer gluten free bread.  I usually try to just eat a burger without a bun, but I splurged and decided to go with the bun and sweet potato fries.  Delicious!  The but held up really well, sometimes when they're gluten free they will fall apart.  But this was great.   The only thing that seems to be lacking at this location is service.  It seems that every time I sit inside I'm there for a minimum of 2 hours.  I don't really want to sit at Cheesecake Factory for 2 hours.  I have things to do.  When I sit outside, the service seems to be great.  Order is taken quickly, food comes out in a reasonable time.  The check comes out on time.  I don't feel like I'm spending my whole day there, yet I don't feel rushed either.  But man, every single time I sit inside, it's a production, that lasts far too long.  I'm not sure if they just don't have the proper amount of wait staff inside, or people just get too busy.  But they need some help in that area."
Vickey A.,"Reno, NV",140,400,155,3.0,12/8/2017,"Food is still great, so there's that.  I'll be damned if they've learned how to handle a large party yet though. We had 16 of us at a holiday lunch today and 1 server. To be clear - we made a reservation.  Yes, there was a food runner, which meant more ""auctioning"" off orders, but that didn't help the fact that our food was brought out over the course of 10 minutes.  This means everyone is at a different stage of eating and it's kind of awkward.  When dessert rolled around there were at least 4 people that had to wait for silverware while being taunted by the tasty cheesecake sitting in front of them.   Overall it wasn't a bad experience but it most definitely could have been better.   I'm not sure why they didn't give us 2 servers??"
Michelle H.,"Reno, NV",98,27,1,1.0,1/8/2018,"I feel like kind of a jerk giving them 2 stars and only now writing a review because I have loved Cheesecake Factory for many years. We have eaten at this location many times and have always enjoyed the food and the service. This review is for the takeout and the food for THIS specific time. We ordered takeout on Christmas Eve.  My burger (see photo) had a lovely piece of string wrapped around it. Lost my appetite immediately for obvious reasons, and since we live across town, we weren't going to drive all the way back. Before I wrote a negative review, I try and talk to management first. That being said, I called them after finding said string. Was told by the woman who answered that the manager was on another call. I have her my name and number and have yet to have them return my call."
Sophia R.,"Sparks, NV",152,101,47,5.0,1/8/2018,"We had great service and food here. My boyfriend enjoyed his burger, his daughter had the grilled cheese and I had a steak sandwich. Our server was very nice and attentive even though it was busy. The wait was about 30 minutes on a Saturday night but it was expected."
Sam B.,"San Francisco, CA",284,109,31,5.0,11/8/2017,"Yum, yum, yum, yum.  One of my favorite restaurants. I have never had a bad experience at a Cheesecake Factory, they've all been great, but I have to say this one is my absolute favorite. I love the consistency this location offers. The food, the service, the atmosphere - always a joy.  My favorite entree is the fish tacos. It comes with four, so it's definitely a filling selection. It comes with rice and beans, I am not a fan of rice, so I get the sauteed spinach and it's delicious (I know it doesn't sound good with tacos. Ha! But I love it.)  They have a specious outdoor patio that they keep nice and toasty for the cold season. When they tell you it's heated they mean it - felt the same as being indoors."
Shannon J.,"Reno, NV",71,116,40,2.0,10/17/2017,"So this review is just on the take-out cheesecake counter.  On Friday night while browsing at the mall, I decided to get a slice of cheesecake to go with the husband. Since we were not eating a meal, we went to the to-go counter. There were three employees there and two servers chatting to them while filling orders. So I waited at the counter. And waited... five minutes later one of the three girls behind the counter finally asked to take our order. For a position that accepts T.I.P.S and suggests so on the receipt, I am surprised that no one could acknowledge me while I stood at the counter."
Linda H.,"Reno, NV",95,298,1342,4.0,10/4/2017,"Came here because I had a craving for fried calamari.  I could easily eat my weight x 10 in calories, especially with Cheesecake Factory's wide selection of different cheesecakes.  Been to the Reno Cheesecake Factory a couple of times.  It was a restaurant we frequented alot with my workmates when i lived in Southern California.  Only issue I have with it is that everything is so darn fattening!  Very hard to practice restraint since all of the dishes are good. I was and am still excited that this restaurant is here in Reno.  Makes it easier to convince my family who still think Reno is some small bodunk town in the middle of nowhere that it's not. The restaurant is a nice chain, very clean, very consistent as a chain restaurant.  Glad it's here to employ our town and bring it's yumminess to Reno"
Clayton M.,"Reno, NV",25,2,,1.0,1/6/2018,We got a gift card to the Cheesecake Factory then the fun stoped it took45 minuets to get are food the staff  including the manager blamed everything else like; 11oz hamburger takes longer to cook and it's the cooks fault or there was a big party. Next time just apologize and make it right. Please Americans eat at local places chain food is bad.
Rob G.,"Reno, NV",0,1,,1.0,1/6/2018,"This was the most horrible food I've had in 10 years. The service was good, The factory Burger had no flavor the tomatoes on it were not fresh, fresh fruit was not fresh,I had  the breakfast brunch and there was so much salt on their I couldn't eat it. the only thing that was good was the drinks."
Kimberly N.,"Reno, NV",87,87,173,5.0,6/4/2017,"Yesterday was my daughter's 17th birthday and this was where she wanted to have her birthday dinner. Her day didn't start out well - she had to get up early to take a couple SAT's. Bummer! I mentioned to the hostess that it was her birthday and they sat us at a ""VIP"" table - which was really nice! The waitress was clued in and was so attentive and sweet. She really gave us the royal treatment!  While the food for our main meal was really good, I have to jump straight to dessert. All the wait staff came over to sing ""Happy Birthday"" and my daughter's cheesecake came out with a mini-sundae, extra whipped cream, chocolate-- just take a look at the picture! I cannot express how something that may not be a big deal to others made a huge impression on us. The manager even came over later to talk to my daughter about when she took her SAT and how stressful and mentally exhausting it was for her. These little gestures really turned my daughter's day around in a positive way and I can't thank them enough for their kindness.  Despite being a chain restaurant where this type of personalized service is unexpected, this Cheesecake Factory went above and beyond to make us, and especially my daughter, feel important.  If anyone that works there reads this, please know that you made a difference in somebody's day!  Words and actions matter. Thank you!"
Jared A.,"Reno, NV",244,74,258,3.0,1/27/2017,"I love cheesecake! It's my favorite type of cake or pie or whatever you want to classify it as! But as for The Cheesecake Factory itself, it's just okay.  I've been here for dinner a few times, and the experience is always the same: a typically long wait to be seated, a typically long wait after ordering, a good, but not outstanding entree, and an amazing slice of cheesecake to end the night.  One of the problems I have with this establishment is the lack of reservations. I usually go here with a large party, so getting a table in a reasonable amount of time is not to be expected. It would be great if a place like this would accept reservations! Maybe then I can bump this review up to 4 starts. But since it's not, I would recommend going here anytime before dinner or just with a small party if you want to avoid waiting. So after getting seated, the real wait begins. At this point, everyone is starving, which is probably why they don't accept reservations. The warm, complimentary bread softens the blow, but in the end, it fills you up too much. And you can never finish your entree, which can be a good thing because leftovers! So, the waitress first asks for drink orders, then comes back with the drinks after what seems like 10 minutes. Then she asks us for our orders, and we ordered a few appetizers, which came out in another 15 minutes. They were nothing spectacular, just good. Then 10-15 minutes later, our food finally arrives. So after waiting over an hour to be seated and after waiting over 30 minutes after taking a seat, we can finally eat. Like I said, the food is okay. I got Fettuccini Alfredo with chicken. The sauce was creamy and the chicken wasn't overcooked, but I've definitely had better at other chain restaurants. The one this this place does have over other chains is portion size. The portion sizes here are ridiculous! This can easily be three normal sized meals. But I guess the portion size matches the price because this place is expensive! The entree was about $20.00, but the quality wasn't. This restaurant might be the epitome of quantity over quality.  As for the cheesecakes here, they are to die for! They are the main reason why this review is three stars instead of two. The cheesecake itself is dense, but creamy. Sweet and rich, but not too decadent.  And light, but not to the point where the other flavors overpower the cheesecake. I would definitely recommend any of the fruit flavored cheesecakes. The chocolate/caramel/candy variations are just too decadent for me. The cheesecake was the perfect end to what would otherwise be a forgetful meal. As for the service, I found them to be really nice and accommodating. After being seated, our waitress was kind, friendly, and regularly checked up on us. She refilled waters very often, and she even offered to split the check.  As for the ambiance, I don't particularly like it. It's WAY too dark. I know low-lighting is supposed to make things more intimate, but this place takes it to a new level. I wish they would turn on the lights just a little bit. But other than that, this place is a little more upscale than your typical chain restaurant. It has a classier vibe, but I still can't get over the lights, or lack thereof. Overall, just go here for the cheesecake. And I would just recommend take-out. The wait was long, the food was unmemorable, the lights were nonexistent, but the service was great!"
Anna M.,"Reno, NV",106,82,304,3.0,6/27/2017,"I have ate here numerous times and when I think of a sweet treat my first thought is Cheesecake Factory, I love the fact that it is open late and you don't have to go through a crowded, drunken, smoke infested casino, to get decent food before Midnight. I have always had constantly good food from here, and the Cheesecakes are to die for, I would like to try everyone on the menu!! I came in the other night for some appetizers and Cheesecake. I was just so disappointed. We ordered hot spinach and cheese dip, it was seriously lacking flavor...made me so sad, it was just really bland. So I guess I will just stick to what I know is safe and just order Cheesecake from now on."
Trista B.,"Reno, NV",0,23,5,4.0,10/13/2017,"I was very eager to try this restaurant after hearing all of the hype about it. The interior was very classy and comfortable- other than being connected to a mall. (Makes for a busy parking situation).  The menu is massive and makes it slightly difficult to decide on an entree. I decided on fettuccine Alfredo and I wasn't extremely impressed, but not disappointed either. The food wasn't bad, however It was a little bland. I chalked it up to the fact that they have a massive menu and it makes it hard to perfect each meal when that is the case. The service was great, and we did order a slice of cheesecake for dessert- which was delicious."
William S.,"Reno, NV",18,79,23,4.0,5/27/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory in Meadowood Mall is a restaurant that I visit every couple of months.  I have found the food and service consistently to be good and they do live up to a reputation as being the place to go for cheesecake.   If I was to comment I would say that a lot of their food is ""heavy"".  It is very good - but I like to get the lunch size because the dinner portions almost always have a to go bag.  On my last visit I had the ""Shepard's Pie"".  (By British standards this would actually be a Cottage Pie since it's made with beef instead of lamb).  Cheesecake Factory uses a high quality beef and the dish overall is very good. My friend had a salmon dish which was also very good. This location has both indoor and outdoor seating with heat in the winter.  It is on the outside of the mall so you can shop or just walk around after dinner inside.  I also have never run into bad service with the staff always being friendly and helpful. After a dinner we usually slit the cheesecake.  I really enjoy the season options including pumpkin around Halloween."
Tom Y.,"Felton, CA",1,88,1,3.0,9/16/2017,"The first time we've been to this location.  Stopped for lunch after some shopping.  The place was still nearly empty, yet we still had to wait over 5 minutes for seating ... Seriously. The food was really, really good, Fettuccini, Cuban sandwich, the Garlic Parmesan bread, cheesecake for dessert. The service was just okay. The cost was very expensive for what we had.  Seriously $9.50 for a half glass of cheap wine, I could have bought three bottles at Trader Joe's for $9.50. Definitely not something place we'll be coming back to. We can eat at most every restaurant in town with comparable food quality for about half what Cheesecake Factory charges. Between the wait, the average service and cost I feel generous giving them the Stars, only because the food was so yummie"
Samantha W.,"Reno, NV",209,198,531,3.0,10/26/2016,"Well, I'm not overtly excited about this place. It was nothing super amazing and exciting and I was so thrilled with my visit, but it wasn't also terrible that I want to forewarn future patrons.  It's a nice little place with decent food. If you're looking for a finer dining setting either in the mall or in the area, this place is great.  The appetizer my husband and I shared was PHENOMENAL! it was the parmesan garlic cheese bread. Do get this. You won't regret it if you love cheese and garlic bread. I may go back just for this appetizer and the cheesecake. My dinner wasn't amazing. I got the four cheese pasta. I wasn't thrilled with it. It wasn't spiced amazingly, nor were any flavors worth ""writing home about"".  Service wasn't awful. We were seated on a Monday night around 6 almost instantly. Our waitress was prompt on drink and appetizer orders. Once she got our entrée order, she seemed to be nowhere. Trying to order dessert took a little longer than I would have liked. But she was super friendly and cordial and joked with us. We had a gift card that we were given as a wedding present and that's the only reason we came here. As far as future date nights here, probably not."
Kelly L.,"Reno, NV",0,3,,2.0,12/18/2017,"Went on Saturday at 1pm with a friend. We waited about 20 minutes for a table but that was totally expected.  After we had sat down and waited for awhile, two other people were sat at the table right next to us. When our server finally came by she took the next table's order first. My issue was not that she took the other table's order first but when she was taking their order, her butt was on our table, she was practically sitting on our table! Not cool.  Anyway, we were already there and it was getting late for lunch so we thought we would just order and eat.  Food was decent, I thought the egg roll samplers were tasty. I've been to Cheesecake several times and I've always enjoyed the food. Two-star rating is not a reflection on food but on the service.  She should have really stood on the other corner of the table or make little more space between the tables."
Brandy W.,"Scottsdale, AZ",83,460,45,4.0,3/16/2017,"Like ever other Cheesecake Factory in the nation, it has pretty tasty food and definitely something for everyone on their enormous menu. I was impressed that although this is the smallest CF I've ever been in, they didn't subtract any menu items. I would think this could even pass for a CF Express, if those exist. It's really 1/3 the size of most I've eaten at.  The prices are pretty expensive, but that bread they bring out to start is just so darn delicious. We all fight over who gets the squaw bread! My kids can't get enough.  During Christmas they run a promo to buy an eGift Card for $25 and you get TWO cheesecake slices free. Considering the price of cheesecake is like $7/slice, it's worth it. We always grab some of those and indulge when the winter starts getting the best of us and we need to escape the house.  We've had so many things, but love the avocado eggrolls, southwestern corn cakes, orange chicken, their Evelyn's veggie pasta, and avocado toast. My kids share the sliders meal because they are light eaters and it comes with two burgers about the size of two McD burgers with fries. It's totally plenty for them.  Always return and always like it... but nothing beyond extraordinary. Just good, solid food that pleases everyone. And that Godiva cheesecake is the very best."
Barbie H.,"Fernley, NV",1,9,4,5.0,11/8/2017,"They have excellent food, great service and yummy cocktails! Even though apple martinis aren't on the menu, I always seem to get them to make me the yummiest one maded with apple pucker. They are known for the avocado egg rolls and their famous cheese cake! Definitely a good spot to splurge and indulge!"
Lauren K.,"Reno, NV",53,138,758,4.0,2/16/2017,"Open late and always busy. So generally I am not a very big fan of chain restaurants. The food tends to be uninspired, not locally sourced and just leaves you thinking, man with all the amazing places in Reno, why did I just spend 20-40 dollars for a frozen meal basically. Well, not that cheese cake factory doesn't run into some of the things you find in chains, they have fresh food that's cooked to order. And it's actually quite tasty. I have yet to find a better veggie burger locally and there's is huge. I live near by so when it's a late night after the gym I order curb side to go veggie burger with sweet potato fries, side of ranch. Their ranch is really good and buttermilk based and you can buy it along with their other dressings in a jar for 5-6 dollars, by the cheese cake display. The veggie burger is large and in charge and you won't be missing meat with chunks of  brown rice, farro(adds a nice texture), couscous, mushrooms for meatiness, black beans, chopped veggies. PETA website says if you hold the cheese and mayo with the sour dough bread, it is vegan. Holds together nicely and isn't dry at all. The Fontina cheese was melty and stringy and the tomatoes seemed cut to order as well as the onions, very fresh.  The sweet potato fries are yummy in the ranch and come in a cute paper bag that soaks up any extra oil. Curb side to go, you also still get bread if you want.  Couldn't help myself checking out staring at the cheese cakes. I got the carrot cake cheese cake, moist with chunks of raisins and nuts with the super sweet cheese cake and cream cheese frosting. It was ready in the amount of time the girl quoted on the phone. I have eaten here during busy hours and it can be a 2 hour ordeal. Just keep that in mind if you have a movie or something to get to. The patio also offers nice area to sit with heat lamps and appetizers are huge as well as their portions. Their curb side to go has never let me down. The order is always right and they go over it with you before you leave by showing you each item is up to par."
Michelle G.,"Reno, NV",115,136,327,3.0,3/3/2017,"Who doesn't love cheesecake? I believe it's in its own food group. However I was taught to eat my dinner first then dessert. If and only if you eat all your dinner. So I ordered the steak tacos. The taste was good but they seemed rather small. It does come with rice and beans but the temperature needed to be increased. One of my pet peeves is lukewarm food. I am sure our server was busy, as well as the cooks but nothing is worse than allowing food to come out at the incorrect temperature. Did I have cheesecake after dinner? You betcha... Banana Cream... You redeemed some of my negative impressions by delivering this creamy, piled high with fresh sliced bananas, and out of this world fresh whipped cream.  Wow.... Such a fabulous way to end dinner...Hmmmm maybe that's why my tacos were so small...Making sure I had room for dessert."
Aiyana M.,"Reno, NV",127,71,94,2.0,1/30/2017,"The cheesecake is the ONLY thing worth coming here for.  I've attempted to like this place numerous times and I'm still on the fence about it, but leaning more towards its not worth it to me.  And I just have questions....a lot of questions.....  -Why is there a wait when there are plenty of tables available?  -Why are there a ton of items on the menu?  -Are these meals frozen?  -Why is it so pricey?  -Why is the service good only on rare occasions?  I've tried a few things on the menu and unfortunately I've never been blown away. Their frozen cheesecake is good though. Lol"
Kentrell D.,"Manteca, CA",5,9,9,1.0,11/4/2017,"The menu is humongous! The food is sub par. Everything is sweet, like literally they even put sugar in the gravy... so disgusted with my main course I did not bother with dessert!"
Leanh E.,"Reno, NV",43,122,485,4.0,7/17/2017,"I'm usually not into big chain stores, but very impressed! My family and I couldn't decide what we wanted for lunch and I told them that I needed to eat healthy, so burgers or anything heavy was out of the question. My daughter came up with the idea to come to the Cheesecake Factory, because of their extensive menu and she assured me that I would find something that I could eat without blowing my diet. I was like yeah right the Cheesecake Factory?  That's usually where we get the delicious rich cheesecakes for special occasions.  Went in and they had a skinnylicious menu!  Wow, surprising; however, I was sure it wasn't going to be that great,  because anything low cal usually lacks flavor. I ordered the Tuna taki salad and it was so delicious. I didn't even blow my diet at 510 calories for lunch that was low carb. So good that I would definitely come back and get it again. It was really tempting though to get the cheesecakes that were displayed in the case by the entrance."
Mr Sharon O.,"Reno, NV",240,90,175,1.0,10/13/2017,"You go to a chain not for its ""fine dining experience"" yet for consistency, been frequenting the cheesecake for many years, but for some reason, this one here in Reno just keeps shooting itself in the foot!, no matter how many times we try to return, we keep getting punished, it's not the serving staff, it's 100% the kitchen and the fact management can't keep the line in check! This time though, it was our last.... Fare well...."
Lorelei L.,"Reno, NV",17,42,72,5.0,6/30/2017,"Service and food are great cheesecake was superb. By the time we got done, we are sooooo stuff. Can't wait however, to go back here again next time for some appetizers and libations  So we came back to this restaurant for our wedding anniversary dinner on June 30th, I anticipated a big crowd and long wait since it's Friday night on the 4th of July weekend, so I decided to call ahead and spoke to a sweet-voice Maitre D Megan, she said that they don't normally take reservation but since I mentioned my husband and I are celebrating our 17th year anniversary, she said she will try her best to get us a table fit for the occasion. We came in and introduce myself and figured the bright eyed sweet smile hostess was Megan.  She was very accommodating and sat us on a big nice private booth to have our special dinner. I thought that was an awesome customer service, our server Zac was also great, he was polite to ask for drinks and dinner bread with butter to start with while we peruse the menu.  We decided to start our meal with their so called ""fire crackers, it's a delightful appetizer, lightly cooked salmon wrap with spinach veges covered by a light wonton wrapper with a salad of purple cabbage and an exotic sesame soy dressing.  I have ordered their factory combo - Steak Diane & grilled salmon with steam rice and asparagus and Rick ordered Medium rare New York steak with mashed potato & some summer Veges, I have also requested for my Cosmo Martini as my dinner drink.  When our food came in the presentation was so first class restaurant look and as we tasted our food it was superb!  our compliments to the Chefs which we advise our server Zac to mention to the Chef. It was a wonderful dinner experience and I would not have second thought to come back and celebrate our special events here, and recommend my friends and family to do the same. I can only wish that other restaurants in town could do the same."
Marlon T.,"Reno, NV",1083,2364,1516,3.0,6/9/2016,"I don't usually go to huge chain restaurants like this unless a friend really wants to, so I ended up here on a Sunday brunch and had a decent experience. It was one of those times where the corporation was doing it mostly right and things weren't really slipping through the cracks. My outside table was well-placed, the service was excellent, but the food was not the best (more to come on that). I've never had Sunday brunch at a Cheesecake Factory so I had to try something on the brunch menu--I went with the Chicken and Waffles Benedict. The only place in the world that I've liked Chicken and Waffles is in Washington, D.C. at Founding Farmers restaurant. For some reason I keep thinking I might like it elsewhere, especially if there is a twist on it (in this case with eggs and tasty hollandaise sauce). Well, while the dish might've been a little more enhanced than I expected, I still did not like it as much. Furthermore, the ""potatoes fries"" that it came with were overcooked and too crunchy. The plate was mostly brown, and it could've been garnished with some color. So, I would definitely not recommend this dish and wish I had gotten something else. I'd definitely give 4 stars if it wasn't for the flop on the food. So, it's a chain and if you're not a huge food snob, then you'll probably have a better time here than I did. I encourage all folks to seek out local eats before you succumb to a giant corporation."
Ina B.,"Reno, NV",0,1,,4.0,12/28/2017,"I love the food and happy hour! My only issue is that there is no internet connection while sitting inside. I asked the bartender, and it was confirmed."
KayCee H.,"Gardnerville, NV",0,6,,3.0,11/22/2017,"So this restaurant has been in Reno at least a couple years and I have been slow to visit. Usually visiting a chain restaurant doesn't top my list because they are all the same, right? Well my daughter and I visited last week and I was seriously disappointed.  It was loud, dishes banging around and sounding like they were thrown into dish tubs. It was later in the afternoon,  not even lunchtime. I asked for lemon in my water, didn't happen. Our waitress was more consumed with up selling our experience. Eh, not appealing. We took slices of cheesecake to go. Me and my husband's were good but my daughter's was just ok. A big glob of cookie dough was plopped on top not inside if the cheesecake. It was disgusting! I think it's overrated!"
Tynne H.,"Janesville, WI",10,3,4,4.0,7/25/2017,"We went here while on vacation for our sons 21st Birthday. I love the Cheesecake Factory in general but I was a little disappointed with this one. Servers were friendly, but a couple of our orders were messed up, things not delivered etc. I would understand if it was packed but it wasn't at all on a Friday night.  Nothing about this location stood out as exceptional. Food was as expected minus the errors on multiple orders at our table."
Melissa S.,"Reno, NV",40,148,43,5.0,6/9/2017,"My first time at this location and it went pretty well. I was told a 15 min wait, and got seated by 10. It was very busy today, and even had some birthdays while there. However, this didn't stop the great service I got. I ordered a dr. Pepper, and fried macaroni to start. It was very good, but that combined with the bread made me more full than expected. I should have skipped appetizer. For my entree I chose the white bean chicken chili. This comes with a nice layer of rice at the bottom of the bowl. It doesn't look like much, but it was very good and I was only able to finish half of it. I ordered the coffee cream chocolate supreme cheesecake to go, which was also verrrry good when I ate it later."
Danny S.,"Modesto, CA",26,5,4,5.0,7/15/2017,"Me and my wife are regulars when there is a cheesecake factory around, they have a little bit of everything (pasta, pizza, meatloaf, sandwiches, soups, burgers, chicken, stakes ect..) the difference between this cheesecake factory and others is a hostess names Chelsea! She made our lunch visit a spectacular one. She was constantly checking on on us making sure our drinks were topped off, making sure we were more then just good, that we were great! Chelsea has such an amazing personality, her uplifting spirit can brighten anyone's day! She definitely made our great day even better with her amazing customer service and hostess skill any time we are here in Reno an visit the cheesecake factory we will be looking forward to seeing Chelsea thank you for everything!"
Vanessa M.,"Sparks, NV",138,110,521,5.0,5/14/2016,"Had lunch with a friend today here and had yet another great experience. We were seated right away and our server was amazing! She never missed a beat when we needed something.  Our bread was brought out right away. We ordered the portobello, avocado and zucchini fries as an appetizer which have always been wonderful and just as wonderful this time too. I ordered the lunch special Chicken Piccata which is always one of my favorites.  The lunch special size is so perfect since its so tasty that I tend to keep eating after I am full. This time was no different. I cleaned the plate and have no idea how I managed to fit it all in my stomach. My friend ordered the lunch special Chinese Chicken salad which amazed me on how HUGE that thing was! It looked fantastic and she loved it. Its one of her favorite items.  I am never able to leave without cheesecake but I knew I was so full I wouldn't be able to eat it so I ordered my favorite one, the Oreo Cheesecake to go to snack on tomorrow. So for tomorrow i have my left over Portobello, Avocado and Zucchini fries and cheesecake. Sounds like a good lunch to me!  Thank you for another wonderful meal."

Cheesecake (pecan turtle) was a little too rich but that could have just been my husband and my taste. The 3 stars was for; no salt n pepper on table, no sugar for iced tea on table, when finally given salt and pepper, we couldn't shake it out because packed too full. Service was somewhat slow and standoffish. So much potential but could have been better. Will try again though soon."

Located in the meadowood mall , there is ample parking. We arrived around 1:30, and had to wait only five minutes. They restaurant is very clean and well lit, and is decorated with a very warm and welcoming touch. It can get a bit loud, the tables are very close together. The size of the restaurant is much smaller than the other cheesecake factories we have been to. I started out with potatoe soup. This was delicious, chock full of potatoe chunks, cheese, sour cream and chives. My entree was a Cobb salad. Included in the salad was bacon , chicken,tomatoes, blue cheese crumbles, and cheese. I changed the dressing from vinaigrette to thousand island. The salad was huge, and delicious. I would get it again in a heartbeat. We ended with cheesecake for dessert. The reason for three stars is this restaurant is expensive. For both of us it came to seventy one dollars with tip. A bit pricey for me, so I will visit on special occasions."

Amanda F.,"Reno, NV",83,77,82,3.0,4/27/2017,"Went here for lunch today, there was only one other table with people in our section. It still took forever to get service. 20 minutes before we even got a glass of water. The food was awesome as always, but if it weren't for the food I wouldn't god back."
Melissa B.,"Sparks, NV",39,70,104,4.0,5/1/2017,"Love me some Cheesecake Factory ya'll!  First time I went there I was expecting the Cheesecake Factory from the Big Bang Theory..hahahah   Nope, it is not quite that.  Anyhew, many visits and calories later...here we are.  Friday night and I wanted some chicken and biscuits.  That is like one of my favorite things on the menu.  Nice large portion, hot, perfectly cooked.  Yum Yum.  The man had the New York Strip, said it was delicious.  We both love the mashed potatoes.  Delicious.  Waiter was friendly and attentive.  Brought his beers and my iced tea right away, kept them full and kept bread on the table.  Yay.  The place is always crowded, but clean and well staffed.  I like the outdoor patio for sure when the weather is nice.  I have tried like five different cheesecakes, always delicious.   My only complaint...not really a complaint, it just is what it is and I know would annoy some people, is that it is VERY loud in there.  It has the Cafeteria sound...very loud, chatty and if you are near the kitchen like we were, you will hear every single dish.  That is really the only negative.  It is not expensive, but it is not cheap either.  You will pay $17-29 a plate.  Appetizers about $10.  For two of us to have one appetizer, two meals, two beers and an iced tea it was $72.00!  So, it ain't  Applebees 2 for $20, but hey, I like it.  Yummy and you will have your favorites in no time. So, yay, I am a fan."
