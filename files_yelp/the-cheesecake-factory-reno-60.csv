Jen D.,"Reno, NV",239,76,15,5.0,10/2/2014,"I've been to other Cheesecake Factory locations but on my first visit to this Reno one, the food was tasty, ambience was wonderful and our waiter was attentive (although very busy). We had a great time and we will surely be back! 5 stars from me."
Lexie F.,"Roseville, CA",2,13,8,2.0,7/17/2016,"Delicious food, terrible service. Server used a fake-nice, condescending voice with us while we were unhappy with our slow service. Server forgot to ring in an appetizer, one of the entrees came out incorrect, and the alcoholic beverage originally ordered took fifteen minutes to get to the table. We are unhappy with the slow service, missing appetizer, late entree (because it was originally incorrect), and generally distant service. It was late on a Sunday night and we felt unwelcome. The manager was accommodating and apologetic for the service and took the late entree and birthday cheesecake off of the bill. Generally unhappy with all Cheesecake Factory service, this is not the first time."
Jon J.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,97,23,4.0,12/17/2014,"Went to Cheesecake Factory on Dec. 17. Absolutely loved the food. Adriana was our server and she was incredible. I enjoyed everything she suggested and wish I could've ate all of it, but alas, tummy has spoken. However, I'm only giving this four stars because during our meal some random server came up to our table and took my friend's drink out of my friend's hand because it was the wrong drink or something. Honestly, we wouldn't have noticed but not cool. Besides that hiccup, we will be back. Thanks again, Adriana!!!"
Stacia D.,"Reno, NV",186,121,153,4.0,8/22/2014,"This is the first time I have ever visited a Cheesecake Factory. I went at 11:30am and met a party of 5. We were seated without a wait. The menu is 21 pages, and includes everything from Mexican, Italian etc. I got pasta and cheesecake for dessert. We got great service, and the food was good! I'd go back again for sure!"
Kim G.,"Reno, NV",1,32,15,2.0,9/16/2015,First they served 3 of the 4 of us and we had to ask where was the fourth meal?   They brought the appetizers with the meals (those they brought anyway).  Poor quality food.  How do you wreck a chopped salad?  It was tasteless.  Then we ordered the vanilla bean cheesecake to end the dinner on a better note...... Nope......it tasted like a cheap grocery store buttercream frosting.  Meh.   Service so slow on a Wednesday night even.  Had to ask for water refill. Two stars because the chocolate mousse was good I was told.  First and last time at this place.
Scott W.,"Reno, NV",27,19,4,3.0,12/5/2014,"Food is descent, cheesecake is awesome, if you go to CF for any reasons, make it the cheese cake. Recommend going during the day, as dinner hours tend to be a bit more crowded."
Michael L.,"Reno, NV",589,731,47,3.0,1/3/2015,"Finally decided to give a try. Lunch on Saturday, busy but was seated straight away on the patio. I like the seating and the heat was more than adequate.  The waitress was all smiles and did a fine job. Gus got the bang bang, I think that is what it was called and he enjoyed it. I ordered the orange chicken. Well I took two bites and packed it up to take have and fix it up. I offered Gus a bite and he just laughed and said no thinks, looks dry. Boy was it dry. The word orange would come from the sauce of which there was not enough to give taste or moisture. I probably will just toss it rather then fart around with it. So one good, one not so good along with comfortable seating and decent service equals ok."
Kailani I.,"Reno, NV",0,5,,5.0,1/3/2016,"Came during their weekday happy hour 4-6 p.m. Most of their food and drink selection was only $5 Great Food, Fantastic service and atmosphere!"
Joseph Y.,"Sparks, Reno, NV",61,13,,2.0,9/16/2015,I ate at the cheese cake factory today 09/16/2015 a the service wasn't up to par from when it first opened I feel like it's going down hill but the food is still good the servers should check on you at least half way threw your meal cuz my drink was empty when I got my food and she asked me after I was done with all my food if I would like a refill they definitely need better customer service training
Chandler P.,"Quincy, CA",0,4,,3.0,8/7/2015,"We love the cheese cake factory but not in Reno we have been to this restraunt about 6 times now and 5 out of 10 have received absolutely mediocre service, the waiters are not caring, very forgetful, and not one meal has been exactly what I ordered. We have filed complaints with corporate and received a gift card but that is not our goal here we gave the gift card away. We want Reno CCF to see that have a traning issue and need to work on their staff so we can feel just as we do at the other CCF'S we visit."
Kim J.,"Sparks, NV",0,18,,5.0,10/4/2015,"My family and I dined here for my birthday.  It was the first time we had dined at The Cheesecake Factory and it was not disappointing! My parents arrived first to secure a table as they do not take reservations.  They waited for about 10 minutes and were seated about 7:30pm.  My husband and I arrived a short while later. The menu is extensive.  It almost makes it overwhelming to try and decide what to order especially if it is your first visit.  Then they have a whole separate menu with healthier, lighter fare on it.  If you have room for dessert, or just come for the cheesecake, that portion of the menu will require some perusing before making your decision too!   I ordered the Parmesan Crusted Chicken.  It was awesome!  It was very flavorful and moist, and everyone I shared a bite with agreed.  I would love to have the recipe to recreate at home.  It was even good the next day for lunch.  The portions here are huge (similar to the large portions at Claim Jumper).  My entree included 4 small, thin cut chicken breasts plus at least a cup of mashed potatoes and some green beans.  My husband ordered a turkey sandwich with a salad from the lighter fare menu, my dad had a Tuscan pasta dish, and my mom had another pasta dish which they all seemed to enjoy as well. We managed to save room for dessert, but even part of that went home in to go boxes!  My dad ordered the classic cheesecake with berries on top, I had the Reese's Peanut Butter Cup cheesecake, my husband had a four layer chocolate cake that was so rich it took him three days to finish it, and my mom had another one of the cheesecake choices.  We all enjoyed our desserts, and I highly recommend the Reese's Peanut Butter cheesecake if you like peanut butter and chocolate. Our waitress was attentive, very cordial, and quite knowledgable about the menu.  The restaurant was quite elegant even though it is part of Meadowood Mall.  It looks nothing like the one portrayed on the show ""The Big Bang Theory"".  :)  The prices are higher than the average restauant, but the food quality and portion size are excellent, and the cheesecake alone is worth a visit.  The service was great and the ambience is very nice.  I hate having ""Happy Birthday"" sang to me, but they will do so if you request it.  Thank you for an enjoyable birthday evening, Cheesecake Factory!"
Kelly B.,"Wellington, NV",105,97,105,2.0,10/26/2014,"Service was, so slow.  Ice tea was bad and I sent it back twice, tasted like coffee.  Waiter tried but our water glasses were more empty than full.   Appetizers were good, we wanted to order more, but didn't feel like sitting any longer as you can't get anyone's help.      Cheesecake was delicious.   More attention to the customers would be nice.  We really felt  all alone.   Ok.  Update.   10 months later.  8/8/15, What is so wrong with this place and crappy service??    Took my daughter in law to lunch as she was so excited to eat here.     For the cheesecake mostly.  Man, sat at a bar table, no silverware, salt, etc,,,,  took our drink order, asked for sweet n low, took half a glass of drinking tea to get sugar.   Wow.   Served us bread and butter, no plate or utensils.   Brought plates, still no utensils, lol, buttered our bread with the butter wrapper.    Someone else brought our food, we walked over to the next table to get salt, took 15 minutes before waitress even asked about our food.   I asked for more salad dressing, she took forever.   Didn't want to leave a tip, but I am not like that.  Ok, 3 strikes and I won't be back again.    Terrible service all 3 times.   Soooo inattentive.    Food was delicious. But service?????????????   Where is management?    I'll just takeout cheesecake from now on."
Amy K.,"Reno, NV",0,12,20,5.0,9/27/2014,Jambalaya was just like I remembered it.  My husband had the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp and was equally pleased.  Still very busy on the weekend so there is a wait which we are happy to see.  Our waitress Donna was very pleasant and on top of things.  Great job Reno Cheesecake.... (a shout to the bartender staff as well).  We wish you long term success in Reno!
Sarah G.,"Henderson, NV",0,18,1,1.0,6/24/2016,"This review is only for the one located in Reno NV. I just moved here from Las Vegas and would frequent the Cheesecake Factory there. I love it and couldn't get enough of it. On my birthday, Anniversary, kids birthdays, husbands birthday, Mother's Day and so on, I would get a slice of cheesecake and it was so big it would last me two days. When I went to the one in Reno it was so small that I finished it in 6 bites, no joke. $8 for a tinny piece of cake!!! The staff is rude at the Reno Location as well. I wasn't greeting with a smiling face but with a simple Hi, what would you like to drink. I asked how much an extra side would be of something and my waitress said I don't know then said want anything else. After my meal I waiting 20mins for my check to find out it wasn't even my bill that was given to me so I had to wait another 10 mins to get the right one. It was very disappointing but I saw the light of going home and eating my cake to find out how small it was. I love the Cheesecake Factory but this location is horrible. I would say save your time and money and go somewhere else. There are lots of other amazing places to eat in town. I will be finding myself another favorite place to celebrate those moments in my life."
Olga K.,"Reno, NV",5,48,73,5.0,10/7/2014,The best avocado eggrolls ever!!! Appetizer but fills you in perfectly with leaving a little spot for sharing a piece of cheesecake . If you like avocados and know how healthy they are I would definitely recommend you to try this appetizer . The special dipping sauce is a perfect match for the rolls. To avoid a waiting period ( sometimes it could be pretty long) I would recommend to sit at the bar and experience fast and one on one service from a bartender. Cheesecake factory is a nice place to go if you are alresdy at the mall. Enjoy :)
Jacob S.,"Carson City, NV",0,6,,2.0,9/19/2015,"Great waiter... Poor quality food Our waiter was awesome (""Abel J""... can't remember his name now) But the food was quite a dissapointment. Not what we would expect for a $100+ dinner for 4. It wasn't that busy, but it was slow and food came out soggy and in some cases under cooked. Would I go back? No."
Captain C.,"South Lake Tahoe, CA",4,74,8,3.0,11/6/2014,"This place is pretty nice...   We went with a group of 10 people. We sat outside, at night and it was warmer than inside and has the most comfortable booth seats ever. Our waiter was cool and competent.  Probably a great place for a date since the deset section is large, mostly cheesecakes and many options. The menu is huge!  Tons of options... although I felt the food a bit pricey for what I received.  The drinks were also on the pricey side for Reno compared to my usual spots.  We had a great time and our waiter was helping us with that. We got a Lot of cheesecake slabs...  It's a good spot. I will definitely go here again if my lady or some friends want to go. Not the type of place I'll go alone or Often though."
Jennifer B.,"South Lake Tahoe, CA",10,24,9,4.0,11/24/2015,Great lunch today. The clam chowder and salads were delicious. Will definitely return when shopping at Meadow Wood Mall
Tina H.,"Reno, NV",0,16,3,5.0,5/11/2016,"My husband and I never get a date night out where it is just us two and no kids. This was a special treat for us. Unfortunately my husbands burger was so red it wasn't even edible, after we already waited 30 minutes for our food to come out, we were just ready to go. We didn't plan on making a big deal of it, he was just going to come home and throw it back on the grill. When the manager (Joe) heard of our mishap he came over and very kindly greeted us and apologized. Already better service than we have experienced other places. But not only that he boxed our leftovers, brought our check and removed everything except the appetizer! We were blown out of the water with his generosity! It really made our night out special. When these are far and few between it sucks when things don't go as planned, but he took it into his control and made our night. So kudos to you Joe! Thank you for being kind, personable, and humble! You are a great manager! We are grateful for you! Remember: being humble and kind is better than being irate and irrational!"
Ed R.,"Reno, NV",12,138,,2.0,9/20/2014,"Having been in Cheesecakes in Vegas, and always enjoying the food across a wide variety of menu items, I was anxious this new one in Reno. My first reaction of the restaurant is typical and nice ambiance/decorating, but i was surprised how relatively small it is inside. The service was borderline terrible. Just a ridiculous wait time from ordering until the food was served. I would guess somewhere around 40 minutes, maybe longer. No excuse for that. The real disappointment came with the food however. Having tried the Baja Chicken Tacos numerous times in Vegas, that is what I ordered, and these were nothing like what I was used to, and really were not very good. I don't know how a chain has such a different product from one restaurant to another. I really don't think I will be returning."
