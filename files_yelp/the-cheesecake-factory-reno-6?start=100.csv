Hannah C.,"Redwood City, CA",64,45,15,4.0,4/17/2016,"Came here in the mid-afternoon, about 3-4pm, and got seated right away (a miracle from heaven, if you know the Cheesecake Factory). We requested a table in their lovely secluded outdoor patio area, which has a roof and large adjustable window screens to minimize the harsh sunlight streaming through. Our seater was so gracious to give us another table when someone started smoking right over the fence near us.  Service was on point. Our waitress Vanessa anticipated most of our needs before we had to ask for them. Refills, bread, etc. I had the bang-bang chicken and shrimp dish, which is my absolute FAVORITE, so I didn't have to read through their novel of a menu. We also had key lime cheesecake for dessert. Food was delicious, atmosphere was perfect (eating outside = daylight, a slight breeze, and no need to shout at each other over the noise inside). Still a pricey restaurant, but when you share a dish and a delicious slice of cheesecake with someone else, it's pretty darn worth it."
Katie J.,"Reno, NV",202,102,304,3.0,1/27/2016,"We stopped in to have some appetizers in the bar area and were very please with the attentive service that we received from our waiter. The ambiance is just like any other of their chain restaurants world wide, and so is their foods quality. We tires the chicken samosas for the first time and it only took us 3 more seconds to completely devour the ""small plate."" It comes with 5 triangle shaped fried wonton rolls stuffed with curried chicken and a cilantro-lime sauce. Just YUM! We also ordered the Tex-Mex rolls which we have had before and they didn't miss a beat. Stuffed with corn, black bean, and chicken, they come with just a little of a spicy kick but is safe for people like me who are spice-intolerant to enjoy. This also comes with the same cilantro sauce as the samosas. Overall, nothing else to report about Cheesecake Factory."
Jessica R.,"Sparks, NV",254,381,401,4.0,1/4/2016,"My family and I were treated to the cheesecake factory for my 26th birthday. I was pretty impressed with the inside when walking in. To the left is a case of all of their specialty cheesecakes you can feel free to drool over while you wait for your table.  I suggest calling ahead of tome and making a reservation because they were pretty busy. Despite that, we were seated within 30 mins which was really nice. We just went next door inside of the mall and watched the kids play in the play area. They gave us a ring and a text message on our phone when our table was ready.  I was a huge fan of our server. She was very sweet, polite, and prompt despite being as busy as she was. I do think they seemed a little understaffed.  For the food, I was a little disappointed. I ordered off of the lighter fair menu. It was lemon shrimp scampi with asparagus. My plate was REALLY lacking flavor. Honestly, I could've expected better taste from a box. It was also kind of cold and dry, as though it had sat waiting after done being cooked for the rest of the food to come out. My fiancé ordered a Kobe beef burger with bacon, mushrooms and fries. He's pretty simple when it comes to food. We're talkin' top ramen simple. He said and I quote, ""yea, it was really good"" when asked if he liked his burger. I ordered a grilled cheese sandwich for my six year old with a side of fruit (which looked really soggy) and mac & cheese for my two year old. I tried a bite of it when he wasn't looking. It was pretty good. My grandma ordered what looked comparable to KFC popcorn chicken. She was expecting it to be Cajun, but she said it wasn't spicy at all. She seemed pretty disappointed with her meal although she said the vegetables it came were very tasty. Sadly, that was all she said she enjoyed. She said it would've been better if the chicken were seasoned more. My grandpa ordered curry seafood jambalaya. He allowed me to try a bite of his food. I liked the flavor, but the pieces of meat were really small compared to the heaping pile of rice.  I guess they wouldn't call it the ""cheesecake factory"" if they did not indeed serve cheesecake, and their cheesecake be pretty dang delicious enough to build a restaurant around the entire concept. The cheesecake was the highlight of my whole night. I ordered the white chocolate macadamia nut caramel cheesecake. If ever one could taste a piece of heaven, this was my version. If one could fall in love with flavor, this would be my first food love in 25 years. Holy cow was it delicious. Had I not been full from earlier, I would have devoured the entire thing. For one I love a good cheesecake, two... I love macadamia nuts, three... I love LOVE white chocolate. Okay getting off of the subject. Anyhow, my fiancé ordered a ultimate peanut butter chocolate cheesecake so naturally I snuck a bite. It tasted just like a reeses peanut butter cup dipped in cream. I ordered a slice of carrot cake cheesecake for my younger two to share, this one I was slightly let down with because the other two were so good. It wasn't very sweet and the cream cheese frosting wasn't very good. My grandma ordered tiramisu cheesecake. I'm not a huge fan of tiramisu to begin with so skipped sampling this one. She said that her cheesecake was and I quote, ""very good."" The verdict: would I return? We all felt it was a little pricy for the portion and flavor of the main courses, but as they have a very vast menu, I would give the cheesecake factory another chance and try something else. *I came back with some girl friends and ordered a few appetizers. I was a HUGE fan of the calamari and the wraps. We sat outside on the patio. Loved the ambiance.*"
Fallon S.,"Susanville, CA",0,11,,5.0,5/3/2017,Great service and the lunch salads are enormous. Enough for 2 people. Very good soup as well.
Don B.,"Gulf Shores, AL",0,89,,3.0,10/7/2016,"I had the fried chicken sandwich which was a little overcooked and dry, my wife had the pasta carbonara that was tasty and well cooked. The service was ok not great. It appeared that the wait staff was really stretched. We went there for the cheese cake and we were not disapointed a bit, it was awesome. To be fair they are known for their cheesecake desserts. Next time will do lunch someplace else and go there for dessert."
Lori P.,"Sparks, NV",9,7,,2.0,5/19/2017,"I love this place and have been to several throughout the country. Was there for Mother's Day, late evening.  We both ordered the miso salmon (our fave), beer and cheesecake. All perfectly delish!!!  We both needed take home containers.  I was surprised that the waitress took our plates and packaged our food somewhere in the back....a huge no-no for us!  However, trusting her hygiene and integrity we paid and took our doggie bags home to eat the remaining portions (which were huge btw) the next day.  Sadly, we report it was dry and tasteless as  our waitress failed to include the tasty miso sauce drippings which surround the salmon and rice.  Lesson learned.....DO NOT LET YOUR SERVER TAKE YOUR FOOD AND PACKAGE IT!"
Sharon J.,"Roseburg, OR",151,382,519,4.0,11/15/2015,"I finally mad it in to eat lunch, I waited for the hoopla to go down before trying it. We sat up at the bar because it is faster then waiting for a table.  Plus we were ordering a drink.  ;) I got a awesome Ruby Red Sunrise.  One was more then  enough.  I ordered chicken pasta in white wine sauce.  (BOY IS IT RICH in taste)  I couldn't eat it all. My girlfriend ordered Steak Diane with red mashtaters......  (Shes not a big eater but she ate all of hers!!)   We shared a lemon pecan cake which again we had to take that home with us because we both couldn't finish the HUGE ONE SLICE. I enjoyed our lunch and everything was great.... But I am not a big big fan of BIG chain restaurants.  I prefer smaller café and such.  The little hole in the walls...."
Haley P.,"Bakersfield, CA",77,30,5,5.0,9/11/2016,"Every time I came here my severs have been amazing! The food is delicious; I always get the four cheese pasta with chicken and some basil pesto. The other day my mom and I came in and she got the salted caramel cheesecake and I got the lemon raspberry cheesecake, they both were to die for! Definitely recommend this place to everyone!!"
Liz J.,"Gardnerville, NV",0,2,,5.0,5/5/2017,My boyfriend and I came here for our anniversary dinner. The service was absolutely amazing and the food was delicious! Their outdoor patio was very nice and cozy. All around great place to eat at!
Tammie J.,"Hawaii County, HI",1,19,8,2.0,12/12/2015,"Visiting Reno just after this Restaurant opened I had the Pear Gorgonzola Flatbread. I fell in love. Even returned twice more during my visit to have it again. There's no Cheesecake Factory where I live.  The first thing I told my family is that I had to get there on my visit to get that flatbread. My Sister was sweet enough to drive to the Mall and bring one home for me. It was so disappointing. Nothing like my previous visits or the picture. Literally 1 piece of caramelized onion 2 pears and 4 sprigs of Arugula and a total of 4 nuts. Plenty of Gorgonzola though. Apparently the trainers have all gone home and nobody's following specks or recipe cards. I Manage a major Chain restaurant and know what a stickler we are. Needless to say, it was nothing like my previous visits and nothing like I remembered. Management needs to do some quality checks."
Taylor E.,"Pacifica, CA",18,15,,3.0,1/13/2016,"The food is good here, as it is at most cheesecake factories, but my problem with this location is with the service.  I have been to this location four or five times and every time I go, I find the service lacking. It is like they can't hold onto a waiting staff and are constantly employing newbies to the industry. My waitress this last time couldn't even remember simple things like what we had ordered for drinks or that we had asked for sides. Normally this wouldn't bug me, but when they expect to be tipped handsomely for a fifty dollar ticket I expect the same kind of service that tip requires. All in all though he food here is great and deserves a visit. Who knows, I may just always be unlucky in the server assigned to my table!"
Krystal P.,"Sparks, NV",23,111,5,5.0,1/18/2016,"If you get past the terrible wait, you are in for a good time.  We waited over an hour for a table, but how can you be mad at a place for being that busy? The staff, from the host to the waitress and even the managers, were all calm, happy and attentive. With the constant flow of people, you would expect someone to be frazzled, but it never showed.  The food was amazing, and the portion sizes were huge! I try to get something different each time I come here. I would recommend.  One minor rant, not about the business, but for all those reading. If you see a large amount of people waiting for a table, wrap it up! We saw a table next to us who stayed for a long time after they had paid the bill. I get it, you want to socialize, you don't want the night to end, you have so much more to say. Seriously, you are not the only person on this planet or in this restaurant. Wrap it up out of courtesy for those waiting and the waitresses working off tips. That is all. Thank you."
Jennifer K.,"Carson City, NV",2,5,4,1.0,6/14/2016,"I walked in and they said there would be a 15 minute wait. Time went by and they were taking other couples that had came in 10 minutes after we did. We sat there and waited a half hour. I finally went to the front desk lady and she said she had already had called my name. She did not because we were sitting there the whole time and I was NOT called. I walked out. The front desk lady knew we were sitting there the whole time, because we were standing in front of her the whole time. It really is a shame they are getting a bad review even when we weren't able to taste their food. The front desk girl was extremely rude. I haven't even eaten here and I am not coming back due to this. Bad customer service."
Kayla K.,"Reno, NV",0,15,,2.0,4/22/2016,"Let me start by saying the food here is really delicious! I've never ordered something here I haven't liked, that alone would make me want to rate it 4-5 stars. But I'm giving it's a 2 because I've eaten here about 4 or 5 times now and every time the service has been SO SLOOOOW! I can understand slow service on a weekend night. However, the last time I came here was 6:30 on a Tuesday night, not at all busy, but it took an hour just for me to get a salad :/"
Scott P.,"Dayton, NV",3,6,,1.0,9/24/2016,Great if you like bland food and diarrhea. I wouldnt feed this tasteless cardboard to my dog.
Alyssa Y.,"Sparks, NV",461,225,151,4.0,12/30/2014,"When rating this restaurant, I had a really tough time. To be honest, I come here for the cheesecake and not much more. The entrees are pretty good but they aren't exceptional. However, I absolutely LOVE the idea of having such a great variety of delicious cheesecakes. I was very thrilled when The Cheesecake Factory came to Reno. I've eaten in the restaurant a few times and loved the ambiance of the restaurant. The staff is friendly and helpful to recommending delicious entrees. This is a place that I don't visit too often but you can bet that whenever I am at Meadowood Mall, I will stop in to pick up a slice of cheesecake to go. I would highly recommend trying the raspberry white chocolate cheesecake for something delicious!"
Linda L.,"Sun Valley, NV",71,14,66,5.0,2/28/2016,"It's been a long time since I've been been back here, I must say it was very very good try out new menu it's yummy and drinks are amazing."
Trayce W.,"North Brunswick, NJ",0,44,28,5.0,9/10/2016,We've been to many cheesecake factories in the past. I actually enjoyed the smaller atmosphere and our server Carly made our dining humorous and pleasurable. We had the steak Diane and it was cooked exactly the way we ordered it.
Mike S.,"Sparks, NV",604,179,15,5.0,8/22/2014,"The Cheesecake Factory is as an American institution as any other restarunt chain. There seems to be a bit of hatred for chains on Yelp and when I read certain reviews I am often pondering, ""Why don't you just stay home and eat a baloney sandwich on Wonder Bread?"". Chains may or not be locally owned, but they are locally operated and you can count on their consistency, if nothing else. They placed this location in what used to be 775 Gastropub and, hell if I can remember what it was before that, I remember thinking when I heard it would be in this location, I thought ""Wow, that's gonna be tight!"" Much to my surprise, the architechts did a hell of a job and it probably helped that they added more outside dining and expanded into the neighboring unit. Sizewise it is about the same as any other Cheesecake Factory located in a shopping mall. Maybe not quite as large as the one in SF that takes up an entire floor or the freestanding locations in other parts of the US, but it is easily twice the space of the previous tenant. It's new and it's in Reno and it's the Cheesecake Factory, so I anticipated a long wait. We were quoted 60-90 minutesm but they texted us in less than half an hour to let us know that our table was ready. With the other review in mind, I saw no people waiting in the dining area to be called to their table. Nor was there any staff watrching me to see if I was going to boost the silverware.  The food was superb. The Vietnamese Summer Rolls and Ahi Tartare were perfect starters. I had a Cuban sandwich with a side salad and have officially dubbed it the Best Cuban you can have in Reno. My wife ordered a chicken and pasta dish, which was also very good.  I washed it down with two Bicardi Mojitos and we finished with the Red Velvet Cheesecake. The most impressive thing I took away was how well the mall has improved since my last visit here mabe 6-7 months ago. The new flooring, lighting and overall cleanliness of what used to be ""Ghettowood"" surprisingly reminded me a lot like Stoneridge in Pleasanton. I wonder if these imporvements had to do with getting Cheesecake Factory to open or reflect new management/ownership? Either way, it left me with the impression that cheesecake Factory is a welcome addition to the area. I hope they do well, the local skinflints will decry the prices and the baloney sandwich eaters will still hate on it, but I will remain a fan and who knows, maybe we'll see a Grand Lux in the near future!"
Kelly E.,"Reno, NV",28,95,12,3.0,12/31/2014,"Went there yesterday for lunch with the ladies! Was disappointed by the service we received.   Our waitress was either stoned or totally overwhelmed with tables.  She brought out the wrong drinks, twice.  Messed up my friends salad...twice.  And finally, brought out the wrong dessert! Aside from being inattentive and frequently making mistakes, it was my meal that I was surprised by! I ordered the Shrimp with Angel Hair Pasta for $17.95.  The pasta was cooked perfectly and the sauce was delicious.  My gripe? The shrimp! I got 4 medium sized shrimp and what looked like 1.5 pounds of pasta on my plate.  For $17.95, I would expect way more shrimp!  The only redeeming thing about this trip was the Lemon Meringue Cheesecake.   I'm from the east coast, we love TCF there! Was disappointed in this visit, shame too."
