Kesha R.,"Garden Grove, CA",86,38,47,5.0,2/18/2016,Always right on! Food and customer service ! My dad ordered a to go whole cheescake ... Amazing!
Mandi D.,"Yerington, NV",0,22,5,4.0,2/4/2017,The food is always delish & good service!  Cheesecakes & drinks are a bit too high priced in my opinion.  Very good though at keeping your drinks topped off!  All & all great place to go for a nice meal!
Jen W.,"San Francisco, CA",695,1379,2318,3.0,9/4/2014,"This is probably one of the smallest Cheesecake Factory locations I have ever been to.  No wonder the line was ridiculous.  Good thing that I've never liked the food!   I do frequent these locations for their fantastic cheesecake.  I normally run in, order from the separate dessert counter, and get out in less than 10 minutes depending upon the line.  This time, I ended up waiting over 30 mins...and there wasn't a line.  I ordered a whole cheesecake and an additional slice.  The whole cheesecakes are elsewhere so someone has to bring it out.   The gals at the register were very apologetic for the wait and I really appreciated that.  I could hear them calling someone over their mic for updates on my cheesecake.  FINALLY, someone brought it out.  I was told that they were having problems finding the order.  I'm just glad that I made it to work on time! The prices for a slice are typically around $7.  The whole 7"" cheesecake I bought was under $30.  You get a pretty hefty slice with delicious whipped cream.  Oh, btw, whole cheesecakes are given to you frozen.  Just leave them out for 2 hours and you're good to go.   Just a 3 star experience for me...Whenever I have a cheesecake craving, I'll be coming back.  Hopefully, I won't have to wait as long again."
Jenlyn L.,"Sparks, NV",18,79,212,1.0,9/9/2014,"I've been to The Cheesecake Factory in Sacramento before and decided to try the Reno location since it's new. Waiting and service wasn't bad even with a lot of parties tonight. We got seated at a very small table which didn't have enough space to even put the appetizer plate with two waters and some utensils. It was literally more like a table for one instead of two. This location is really crowded, the server had to squeeze in between tables to get orders and refill drinks. Whoever came up with the idea to put the Cheesecake Factory here didn't put much thought into how crowded and small the location is.  Every page on the menu has ""Specialities"" on the top which made the menu not so special. We were kind of expecting a small section of special menu but nope. There were a lot of varieties to choose from though. We had the fried calamari as appetizer and that was delicious. It was light & crispy & it came with two different dipping sauces. For entrees, bf got the chicken Romano & I got the factory combo of shrimp scampi & steak Diane. Both of our entrees lacked flavors & presentation. I asked for medium well for my steak but it came out to be burnt & overcooked. Overall, the entrees were horrible. We would've tried the cheesecakes but we were too disappointed to finish the meal."
Trina W.,"Reno, NV",173,169,497,4.0,11/29/2014,"I'm so glad I waited until I came back for a second visit before reviewing. The first time I washere, last week, I was with a group of 10 and it was a total disaster. This time... I had Siara as a server and she was amazing!!! She anticipated everything. Food came out on time and she timed dessert perfectly. She totally, songle-handedly redeemed my faith in Cheesecake factory."
Shane N.,"Sparks, NV",236,177,352,3.0,12/20/2014,"Tonight we had the deep fried macaroni and cheese balls appetizer, I had the chicken scampi, and the ultimate red velvet cheesecake, which were all decent. I sort of lost my appetite after a fifty minute wait, and took most of it home. Our waitress was very friendly.  It's really a very pretty set up they have going on. I guess they all look the same from what my friend told me. Nice place for a date probably, big menu, but the downside was the long wait on a Friday night, at the mall, at the height of Christmas shopping. A wait makes sense, sure but they don't take reservations. Kinda lame."
Brinna B.,"Foristell, MO",2,106,20,2.0,6/21/2016,"Well, what can I say about this CCF that hasn't already been said? Overpriced food that's ultimately pretty bland. I've had the same experience at every CCF I've ever been to. Just because your menu is large doesn't mean it is necessarily a good thing. My boyfriend and I went here this week as a double date. We were seated within the time frame which was nice and our waitress came to take our drink order and didn't return with them for over ten minutes. We split the calamari, which to be fair, was decent but overly salty. We then split the chicken Di Pana which is advertised as lightly breaded chicken in a butter white wine sauce. The chicken was flavorless and the sauce? NO flavor and hardly any sauce. Broccoli side was like eating raw broccoli, not steamed. Only saving grace, as per usual, were the cheesecakes. Won't return for the food or poor service, just for the desserts to-go."
Heather C.,"Verdi, NV",181,124,708,5.0,9/17/2015,Yummy! Others agree because this place is always packed!  I eat in the bar area because there's hardly ever a wait.  I think their appetizer menu prices are spot on as some of the regular menus can be a little price.  I come from the cheesecake though-no whipped cream :)
Robert H.,"Reno, NV",0,1,,2.0,9/11/2016,"I ordered the bistro shrimp to go something I have ordered for years. However, my most recent order was flavorless, the shrimp was burned, and poorly breaded. I feel this is unusual but I needed to express just how poorly prepared this dish was..."
Shannon M.,"Carnelian Bay, CA",0,9,1,5.0,8/16/2016,"Kimberly, the bartender is amazing!!! Come visit you won't be disappointed. Thanks again!"
Leslie V.,"Roseville, CA",8,6,2,4.0,8/13/2016,"I love this place haven't been disappointed yet! The only thing is that the waiters should check on the tables more often. We felt kinda abandoned but other than that food was delicious, always has the great consistency! If you haven't tried it yet try the chicken Marsela!"
Thomas B.,"Sparks, NV",34,30,23,4.0,8/11/2014,"I still can't believe we have one in Reno! I had the Liguria Pesto Pasta with Ultimate Red Velvet Cake Cheese Cake. Yum! Yum! The Pasta was overall pretty good but I choose it in hopes of the pesto flavor that I love. Unfortunately I could not taste the Pesto much at all but still was a good dish. The Cheesecake selection is pretty big. I choose the red velvet because It was really creamy and I just really like the taste of red velvet cake. Great suggestion! Right now the place is packed with all the hype, so be prepared to wait an hour for dinner until it slows down. They'll give you a ticket and take your cell number so they can text you when your table is ready. I prefer the outside patio for it is less noise and more comfortable."
April P.,"Reno, NV",9,71,1,2.0,6/13/2015,"After my father raved about this place, we thought we'd give it a try. It was our first visit and right when we sat down, we noticed that the table settings were dirty (ew!). The manager came and apologized, and had the wait staff check the other tables for dirty settings. Also, as a small side note, it looked like someone had sneezed milk all over the wall at our booth??? The Cheesecake Factory is not one of the cleaner places I have dined at. The food was a solid ""meh."" My fries tasted stale and the burger had soggy buns and bland meat. It wasn't horrible, but I've experienced much better at much cheaper venues. Maybe the Cheesecake Factory should cut down on the menu size and improve the food quality? I'm not sure. We had to ask the waitress for drink refills several times, as she rarely visited our table (the manager brought us our meals and another waitress brought us our dessert). We had to wait around 15 minutes to get our dessert and only after mentioning the wait to the manager did we get it. We waited even longer to get our check and even longer after that to get the credit card returned. We felt very ignored by our waitress. The manager was very nice and is the only reason I didn't rate the Cheesecake Factory one star. Their ice cream and cheesecake are pretty good too! I'd recommend only going for dessert and getting it to-go if you visit so you don't have to deal with the icky environment and poor service. We definitely won't ever be back."
Philip W.,"Sparks, NV",11,30,2,5.0,9/4/2015,"Excellent food and excellent service, the chicken and biscuits are the best if you like chicken pot pie you'll love this!!!"
Lacey H.,"Sparks, NV",23,32,100,3.0,8/16/2014,Went to eat here today and husband got there before I did. They told him 20 min wait making estimate time 1:08. Understand what estimate means however waited until 1:25 and asked about seating and was told another 20 min. Needless to say we left. Definitely need to work on what they say is estimate time.
Troy C.,"South Lake Tahoe, CA",31,120,54,4.0,10/8/2015,"Cheesecake Heaven!! With a menu with almost every flavor you could think of, why would you not wanna come here? Price? The look of the place? Why?... The prices are steep, yes but your getting great quality food that is made in house and made to order, one of many reasons to come, the look of the place had that feeling of dark and gloom there, yes it could use a few more lights but it's not too bad when your eyes readjusted to the place. Overall great staff, take the survey. You get a ecard (Electronic Gift Card) of worth $10.00."
Pam C.,"Sparks, NV",0,5,,1.0,2/19/2017,"Put in our name and was given a pager, after watching those that came in after us get tables we asked why ""Oh, someone took your table."" Why give a pager if you are not going to use it? Will not be going back, to many better places to eat. They should have asked the people that took our table for the pager, it said right next to our name pager #2."
Nicole B.,"Reno, NV",56,227,676,4.0,6/7/2015,"When looking for a late night dessert on a random Tuesday night, this was the only spot we could find still open after 9pm! In fact, they are actually open until 11pm on weeknights. We only came in for desserts. Our waitress was bright, smiling, and entertaining throughout our visit. She was delightful and sweet. My dessert choice for the evening was the Limoncello creme torte. This is the perfect light but sweet dessert to have after a heavy dinner. It has an amazing creamy lemon flavor that I love despite the fact that I usually do not like fruity dessert. This is one of my absolute favorites!"
Phong H.,"Reno, NV",581,457,206,4.0,5/2/2016,"This is a late review but it's never too late to rate? right? cheesy? May be but I know it's not cheesier than their cheesecake which is awesome. Pricey? Yes. My suggestion if you can afford it and it's worth it, BUY the WHOLE fricken cake! instead of slices. I am going to dock 1 star off this place for service. While food and cake are super deliciously expensive, they need to back it up with some good service. Something I expect when my bill is going to be astronomical. They probably should hire mature teens for their bakery as most of them spend their time providing customer service giggling... They could hire more giggling teens to help the waiters who have too many tables to handle with those heavy plates. Just saying."
Derrick D.,"Reno, NV",2,8,4,2.0,6/23/2015,"Another bad experience at the Cheesecake Factory. We were seated promptly but  then again, it's 10pm. That's about the only thing they got right. Began with a dirty plate... Gross! Ordered crab bites and within 5 minutes, we had it. Seemed like it was leftover from earlier that evening and it was just put in the oven to warm up. The outside was warm, inside was cold. We ordered the everything pizza. Waitress came back and said they were ""out of sausage"" so we ordered the pepperoni pizza. Crust was burnt! The only thing worth eating here is the cheesecake."
