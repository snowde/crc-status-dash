T C.,"Reno, NV",0,6,,4.0,5/2/2016,"Awesome restaurant little on the expensive side but worth it all in all, even there worst cheese cake was good just not my cup of tea, the take out is always on point even with specialty orders"
Erykah H.,"San Diego, CA",56,60,63,5.0,10/2/2015,Alexandria is THE BEST Waitress/Server Ever!!! Great conversation very friendly and genuine.  My birthday dinner was made more special because of her. Thank you.
Jason C.,"Reno, NV",27,24,6,3.0,5/21/2016,"The service was great. Manager is very nice.  Don't order a steak here. The first one came out over cooked, sent it back only to get a raw steak. I didn't have the time or the heart to send it back again. Everything else was perfect."
Katherine G.,"Reno, NV",309,99,107,3.0,3/6/2015,"I was really looking forward to eating here. My boyfriend and I had been talking about it ever since they opened back in August of last year. We went for lunch on a Thursday afternoon and we were immediately seated. Our waitress was nice but not very social. Their appetizers and lunch specials were decently priced. We ended up getting their fried mac and cheese balls as an appetizer and the shepherds pie as the main entree.  We waited about 15 mins for the appetizer, not bad, but once I unrolled my silverware I revealed a fork with crusty food on it. Um, gross! I'm already stingy with my silverware at home so to go to a restaurant and receive a dirty fork really grossed me out. Besides that, the appetizer was phenomenal! Perfect amount for two people to share. The shepherds pie alright, but nothing to brag about. Don't know if I'll be returning anytime soon..."
Mary L.,"Reno, NV",146,348,52,2.0,5/4/2015,"Not a fan of this Cheesecake Factory! Been to others and love the brand. This location... Not so much! Came in with 3 adults, a 2 year old and a 8 month old. They sat us outside, the table was COVERED in flys. (I mean 25-30 flys) I ask for another table. The hostess begrudgingly agrees, and says that area is always filled with flys (eww! Shouldn't they handle that, if they know it's an issue!) t the second table, 2 of the 5 place settings were dirty. Our waitress promptly exchanged them for clean ones. The food and service after that was lovely after that. But no one in our party could get past the flys and dirty silverware. We all have not been back."
Ricki M.,"Truckee, CA",118,10,1,5.0,9/10/2014,"Chicken Madeira was excellent , large portion, asparagus cooked perfect.  Smoothie was very good as well and not too sweet. My daughter ordered a hot chocolate but did not like it as it was just too rich flavored I asked for a credit on that and they were very accommodating."
Tracy S.,"Reno, NV",345,683,631,5.0,1/30/2016,"OK...so I've avoided this review because it doesn't seem like Cheesecake Factory is really in need of one--they do just fine on their own.  But I check in there so often that the Yelpbot keeps nagging me to know what is so great about the place, so here it is: the pizza and salad lunch special.  Their Calabrian Pizza is amazing, as is their house vinagrette, and for $12.99 I get a generously sized personal pizza and a nice big salad.  Add to that the fact that they have the tropical ice tea that I love, and I just can't stay away.  Sure, they have amazing cheesecake, and I haven't eaten anything there that wasn't super tasty, and the atmosphere is gorgeous, and the location is so convenient, but the real reason that the check-ins are piling up is because of how often you'll find me in there at lunchtime chowing down on cheap pizza and salad."
Chancy W.,"Reno, NV",0,1,,1.0,4/19/2016,"If I could give zero stars I would. Just got sat at a large booth where we were ignored by multiple servers. Got sat by the hostess who was rude and abrasive upon arrival, to then be ignored for about 20 minutes. There were guests who sat after us who received service, we were not event greeted let alone asked what we wanted to drink. After 20 minutes of sitting there waiting we got up and left. Told the hostess that nobody came to our table, she scoffed and said uh sorry. No thank you, I will take my business and clients elsewhere."
Jamee W.,"Reno, NV",45,25,13,1.0,2/28/2015,"A long wait, horrible service, subpar food, the wrong check, 20 minutes to get the check fixed and if you want to talk to the manager, good luck. He will avoid you like the plague. Never EVER coming back.  That's how I spent the last 5 hours, to sum it up."
Courtney W.,"Ventura, CA",50,76,15,2.0,4/5/2015,"First time at this cheesecake factory, I have previously frequented other southern California locations and I must say I was thoroughly unimpressed.  Food was ok, however the service was absolutely terrible, our waitress was extremely unattentive I couldn't even get her to refill water let alone bread. In fact I only saw her 2 times the entire meal to take our order and then give us the check, then after boxing our leftovers and handing each of us our separate bags she handed us the wrong leftovers, which I found out after getting home.  Service is important when you are charging what they do for food, the food quality is the only reason I am even giving this 2 stars. May give it another try in the future but with so my other great Reno establishments it won't be anytime soon. You would think the managers would be more worried about this terrible service."
Jennifer S.,"Sparks, NV",70,198,15,5.0,3/23/2015,"This place is wonderful!  My husband and I were Starvin Marvin after a day of shopping and needed a place near by to cure our hunger.  I suggested the Cheesecake Factory since we had never been before and I wanted somewhere new to Yelp.  (Yes, Yelping was a factor in our choice). It is located in the mall but they have an outdoor entrance from the parking lot which makes it really easy to access and the sign is red and HUGE so you can't miss it. The ambiance is lovely.  Warm hues of maroon and gold surround the room.  The hostess counter is black and commanding of your attention as you enter.  We were greeted by a friendly man who directed a hostess to seat us.  It was very busy which is to be expected considering it was prime time for lunch. I enjoyed my very large ""lunch sized"" Cobb Salad.  My husband got the ""Italian"" with fries.  We also got the Artichoke/Crab Dip.  All three items were awesome.  If I had to find a complaint it would be that The Cheesecake Factory serves fries in a cylinder cone type thing with the fries pointed up (as is trending) and it made it hard for my husband to eat his sandwich without his wrist knocking into them.  It's more comical than a complaint though. The best part about this place hands down was our waiter Jacob.  He was stellar.  Our drinks were never empty.  He was attentive and got everything we needed without smothering us. He had wonderful energy and he seemed really happy to be working.  If I could purchase a shrinking ray and shrink him I would totally do it.  I'd keep him in my purse and every time we went out to eat I would un-shrink him so we could have the best waiter ever.  He was that good."
Riki H.,"Reno, NV",97,57,350,5.0,8/7/2014,Our Sever Allyson was amazing. I had the Chicken & Biscuits for dinner. It was just like a upscale version of chicken pot pie. I am so happy to have this restaurant her in Reno. Try sitting out on the patio like we did.
Gideon H.,"Truckee, CA",13,39,1,2.0,2/20/2016,Food is okay but took over an hour for a basic appetizer.  I had to send back my lunch it was made wrong.  I finally left without eating and paying for my kids food.  Terrible overall experience.
Ryan P.,"Gardnerville, NV",0,7,4,5.0,7/21/2015,"This is the only Cheesecake Factory I have been too, and it is damn good. I am sure all Cheesecake Factory's are very good. My Fiance and I come on special occasions and always can't wait. The ladies at the front are very nice and friendly, as well as everyone else. It is real nice treat to come here when we do."
Colby C.,"Reno, NV",8,6,1,4.0,10/22/2014,"While the restaurant is still somewhat new and prone to making some mistakes I had a very nice dinner here. The staff was very friendly and though they could have taken care of a few things better took very good care of my table considering they were packed. I did have to wait quite a while for my food to arrive but I wasn't upset. I was sitting outside under the cosy heat lamps and enjoying the ambiance with the person I was with (also the manager and the chef came to the table to apologise for the delays and comped our appetizer). The food was very good and came with large, though not crazy portions.  All in all the restaurant is very nice, upscale and a little pricy but worth it. They are new though so you can't fault them completely if something goes wrong during your visit. Everyone is still learning :)"
Sy F.,"Reno, NV",121,113,42,5.0,6/29/2015,"Ate here for the first time, I was very surprised, the food and service was fantastic! The ahi carpaccio was very flavorful! Portions are large too!"
D J.,"Reno, NV",2,8,31,5.0,10/20/2015,"Made a quick pit stop at Cheesecake Factory to see what the ""haps"" were. Not as nearly as busy as it used to be. But they have a great happy hour menu!  I had a cold Stella and their Foot Long Dog on scrumptious Hawaiian Bread.  Got to admit, this dog took me back all the way to the Atlanta Braves baseball stadium where I had the best dog ever. The Grilled Hawaiian bread was off the hook! 5 bucks. You could even split it if you want. Stop by for happy hour and take a big bite of this happiness!"
Brian P.,"Reno, NV",39,53,23,1.0,1/17/2016,If I could give you zero I would. Started out the night 6::40 it would be a 40 - 50 minute wait for our party of 4. After an hour we go check back in being we haven't heard anything yet. Mind you a party of two that came in after us has been seated at a booth that could fit 4. So the women at the front tells us it going to be at least 20 more minutes. Are you kidding me I understand about a wait on a busy night but that is bs because we saw people seated that came in after us. I will never send business to the Cheesecake Factory I will make sure everyone I know avoids this place do to the unprofessional manner that is handled at this place . Stay away
Alyssa S.,"Reno, NV",64,102,255,4.0,12/13/2014,"I have been to the Cheesecake Factory many times since they opened. I have always had such a wonderful experience and the last time I went it was extremely poor. I ran into the managers today by coincidence and struck up a conversation. They were very interested to hear about my experience, and seemed to genuinely care. Yara and JT invited me back in to the restaurant and offered to make things right for me. I greatly appreciate their concern and they really did turn around a bad situation. Ok Cheesecake Factory, so we had a lovers quarrel... It's make up time and that will include lots of cheesecake and whipped cream!"
Chesty L.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,172,18,3.0,12/14/2014,"I'm on the fence about this place. It's really hit or/and miss. Out of all the Cheesecake Factory's I've been in, this is the most beautiful. There is a lot going on inside the place.  If your wondering why Cheesecake Factory is at Meadowood Mall. It's because after Legends and Summit mall were built and Park Lane mall was demolish,  Meadowood Mall inherited the titled of being the ""trash mall"" That's why they added Coach, Forever 21, Cheesecake Factory and did some remodeling to avoid that reputation.  I would put this place in the same caliber as BJ's Brewery.  Its menu is enormous, they try and do ""everything"".  This has it's drawbacks.  The food isn't bad, but don't expect anything to be authentic or ""amazing!"" At the very least the portions are filling.  The tables they have are small and pretty close together, the lady at the table next to me dropped her fork and bent down to pick it up and her hair was ""almost"" in my food.  The service has been good so far.  Finally the cheesecake is okay, but for $8 no thanks."
