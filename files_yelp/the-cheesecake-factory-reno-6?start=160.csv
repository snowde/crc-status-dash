Angela P.,"Sparks, NV",1,29,2,4.0,1/31/2015,"MomNlaw took us for our Birthday. Got there at 4:30, no reservation for a party of 4 & 1/2 and there was no wait. They brought a high chair for the baby. Had the fried macNcheese and the warm crab and artichoke dip for appetizers. Crab dip was rather fishy tasting and too spicy. All 4 of our dishes tasted wonderful. Service was great. Booth was not very clean.  MomNlaw asked them to sing to us and they did not."
Rose S.,"Sparks, NV",20,16,7,3.0,5/1/2015,"I had the hibachi steak, the steak itself was very good and the potion was decent, but the fries were over cooked my husband had the beef medallions and shrimp, the potion size of both was too small for the cost of the plate, there was 4 small pieces of beef(bite sized) and only 3 what was supposed to be jumbo sized shrimp,his fries were also over cooked, so for a $25 plate he was not happy, the green salad he ordered was lettuce and 2 pieces of tomato,  of course the cheesecake was excellent  but for 2 people for a $75 meal before tip we felt ripped off"
Yelper Y.,"Chatsworth, Los Angeles, CA",292,1312,22,4.0,1/17/2015,"I've been here a few times for takeout. Everyone I met was friendly, helpful, and fast with getting my food ready. Some people may say that the food is overpriced but I actually think it's reasonable considering the portions are huge. I love their Chinese Chicken salad. Probably the best one I've ever had. Yes it's $15 for the lunch portion but it's huge and enough for 2 meals. I have been going here more since I took advantage of that Black Friday special they had going on. I purchased a $250 gift card (yes my family will be going here now for every family event!!) which got me as a bonus 20 slices of cheesecake! Pretty sweet deal considering each slice is roughly $8. My 30 year old boring white collared chubby ass also likes staring at the hot 20something college guys working here.  So far I've had these cheesecakes: 1. white chocolate raspberry- amazing and not as rich as other cheesecakes 2. cookie dough- good but I probably wouldn't get again 3. oreo- excellent but a little rich 4. lemon raspberry- good but could have used more raspberry  5. aaron's peanut butter cup- so far my favorite!! i love the peanut butter mousse; the only thing is the girl at the bakery section gave me a tiny slice. wtf? 6. chris's something cheesecake- very good and i would get this again but it was the same girl at the bakery so she gave me yet another tiny slice and she wouldn't give me a fork until i asked! watch out for this tattooed girl who always wears bright red lipstick. she's cheap!! 7. Oreo 8. Oreo again I think? 9.  10.  11. 12.  13.  14.  15.  16.  17. 18.  19.  20.  To be continued"
Stephanie C.,"Sparks, NV",352,353,555,3.0,10/15/2014,"I have only eaten here once and I hope to upgrade the stars when I visit again.  We came here about two months after the place opened.  That should give them enough time to work out the kinks. I can't complain about the food.  It was pretty darn good.  We ordered the chicken popper appetizer and it was SO dang good!  If you haven't tried that then you must.  It was worth going back for.  My companions ordered a burger and a chicken pasta dish.  We were all pleased with the food.   The reason behind the three star review was the service.  It took forever to even be acknowledged.  Once we were acknowledged it took a really long time to get our drinks.  Once we got the food served they committed the cardinal sin of serving (in my opinion) in that they gave us our food and walked away leaving us with zero napkins or utensils.  UGH!  One of my biggest pet peeves.  Once we flagged someone down for utensils and napkins we were again ignored for a while.  We split a cheesecake for desert and it was so good.  Then all of a sudden when the bill shows up we get the most attentive and cheerful server all of a sudden.  Wow really?  Where were you during the past hour?   Like I said, I do hope to upgrade the stars when I come back to visit."
Laurie H.,"Springtown, TX",6,95,41,1.0,3/28/2015,We gave them another try. The food was really bad and overpriced this time. The menu changed and the prices went up and the item we wanted to order has been removed from the new menu. So we ordered from the lunch menu. Who serves a mixed up Cobb salad drenched in ranch dressing? It looked like it had already been eaten. Nasty. Sent it back. Waitress was wonderful about it all. Fried mac n cheese was really good and my sons Oreo Shake was great too! It will be a very long time til we return to this store at this location. Too many good restaurants in Reno to waste our money here. Sad.
Gloria R.,"Reno, NV",2,5,,5.0,5/19/2016,My family treated me to a birthday dinner at The Cheesecake Factory and I was so pleased with my chicken dinner (with pasta and a creamy marinara sauce). Delicious!. The desert topped everything off perfectly. I loved the s'mores cheesecake. I took half of it home for a late-night treat a another day. Our waitress was so friendly. She took a great group picture of our party. Great memories.
Adryenn A.,"Reno, NV",1886,193,33,5.0,12/12/2014,"Of course it's great. They have staff trained perfectly. Every location has always been top notch and I'm thrilled we now have one in Reno! The wait can be long, but it's oh so worth it. Tip: put your name in use your cell phone as the reminder. They'll text you when your table is ready so you can do a little shopping while you're waiting."
Marie B.,"Truckee, CA",0,17,,3.0,4/3/2015,"We stopped in to get a bite to eat about 5pm on a Thursday evening. The hostess greeted us, said the wait was 5-10 minutes and gave us a pager to hold, never once looking up from her phone. Suddenly the place was filling up and people that came in after us were being seated. After almost 20 minutes, my friend approached her to see what was taking so long. She informed us that perhaps our pager was broken and we should have been paying closer attention.  We were seated immediately without an apology. The food was mediocre at best; the sandwich bread was stale, the fries were burnt,  the butter frozen.  Rachael was our server and only because if her, am I giving this review 3 stars. She was attentive and considerate and rolled the experience around to a favorable meal.  I realize now, people don't go here for the food, only the cheesecake, and we took ours to go."
Ann L.,"Reno, NV",163,173,126,3.0,10/3/2014,"Had to wait about 10 minutes for a table for 3 on a Thursday night at 6:00 pm.  That wasn't too bad considering the reviews I've read.   I wanted to wait until they had been open for a few weeks before trying it out to give them time to work out the kinks. They said it would be up to a 30 minute wait and we were seated in 10.  Our waiter greeted us promply and got drinks andtookour order quickly.  The food was a little slow to come out but wasn't too terribly long of a  wait.  I had the salmon genovese. The salmon has a nice crusty browness to it.  I dislike mushy fishso i was pleased with this dish. The pesto-type sauce had a nice flavor and texture.    Then there was the cheesecake.   I love lemon pie and cheesecake so why not combin the two and have lemon meringue cheesecake.  Awesome.   Great lemon flavor and the meringe toppiig was a nice touch. While the food was very good, the prices are pretty high.  There are many other choices in the area that are a better value."
Crystal B.,"Reno, NV",6,26,60,5.0,12/10/2014,I went to the cheesecake factory earlier today. This was my second time going there. The food is great. They have a big menu and so many items to choose from. The wait staff is also prompt and bring your items on time. And they are always checking back with you for refills on drinks and other stuff. I do suggest to go there in the middle of the week though. The weekends can be a long wait for a table at the restaurant.
Anne B.,"Truckee, CA",8,27,2,3.0,12/21/2015,"Food great. Waitress was ok. Hostess's were rude and caddy. I'm 44 and felt like I was in highschool. Dumb. Guess they get what they pay for but when you spend good money for good food, staff should matter... 4 stars on food but they get 3 for bad staff."
Melissa R.,"Reno, NV",16,91,213,5.0,5/19/2015,"Oh, ya gotta love the Cheese Cake Factory!!! Mmmmmm!!! This time I ordered the fish tacos which were REALLY good. The taco shells do fall apart but I just used my fork so that was fine I guess. Oh, and I recommend the crab cakes! They are the best!!"
Johnny B.,"Reno, NV",57,362,76,3.0,11/12/2014,"Seating was available immediately on a Friday evening around 6 so we didn't need to make a reservation. That surprised us. The patio is heated so there was the option to sit outside or inside, it was breezy outside so we opted for inside. The first thing I noticed was the size of the menu. It was THICK! But after browsing though it, there are a lot of advertisements. Too many for such a classy establishment. They did have a large selection of food. But the quality was lacking on both of our dishes. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich. It was served as a couple large chunks of pork, which I had to pull/shred myself. It had ok flavor and they served it with a side of bbq sauce so you could add to your liking. I upgraded to sweet potato fries which were tasty but they forgot to bring them with our food and instead brought out regular fries. I had to remind them and they brought out the sweet potato ones. She ordered the Italian sandwich, which had good flavor but the bread was so hard and overtoasted it was inedible.  Cheesecake selections are enormous. We decided to share the white chocolate macadamia nut. Abnormal from anything else I can remember when ordering a macadamia nut dish, this one was LOADED with macadamia nuts!! I was really hoping for a 4-5 star experience here but they fell short.  The cheesecake was the only saving grace on this trip. We will give them another try sometime down the road when they will hopefully have some solid cooks that know how to make some tasty food."
Mike K.,"Reno, NV",172,7,1,1.0,12/17/2014,"My wife and I brought the boys before we head out of town for the holidays. Wanted to try out a new place. We checked in and were told it would be 20 to 30 minutes to be seated.  We strolled the mall for 20 or so minutes and went back to the restaurant. We Viewed the menu outside for a few minutes until we had an idea of what we wanted. Went in and sat down until we got the text that our table was ready. After 45 minutes and stilI no notification. I started to boil.  I went to the checkin desk and said ""we've been waiting 45 minutes."" ""We sent you a notification 20 minutes ago,"" she said.  I didn't want to hear that. We never got it. 10 minutes later we were finally seated.  I want to avoid being an ass at restaurants. I saw the movie Waiting. Enough said. In this case I thought I would just let as many people know via Yelp about this not-so-pleasant experience.  Bottom line they have a broken system. I hope the food kicks ass."
Robsta D.,"Modesto, CA",37,3,4,1.0,10/2/2016,I highly expected the food to be tasting good but did not like the bang bang chicken and shrimp. Don't get me wrong the service was exceptional. The fried mac and cheese was high in sodium. I give it 1 star for food and 4 stars for service.
J H.,"Reno, NV",0,31,,4.0,1/14/2016,"Sadly made the mistake of going on a Saturday night at 6:00 p.m.   We were told a half hour to 45 minutes wait time,  it was over an hour.   When we were finally at our table, the waitress was swamped, we were hungry,  no bread available,  waited 15 minutes for that.   However I love their steak Diane.   It is my favorite, and will of course return at a different time to enjoy my meals from now on."
Char A.,"Bedford-Stuyvesant, NY",25,5,82,5.0,7/5/2015,Their cheesecake selection is the bomb! The only best one of its kind. And this would be my most favorite restaurant of all. Their dishes are also superb!
James C.,"Reno, NV",8,69,148,4.0,4/2/2015,I think this place is made of awesome sauce. Everything we have had is over the top delicious. They start you out with warm bread. Some white and some dark brown. It is so good that I purchase extra to take home. That is a great compliment coming from a dude that makes his own bread. Meatloaf- Awesome Chicken and biscuits- Awesomer!! Yeah I just made up awesomer. My wife loves the Asian lettuce wrap tacos. Burgers are spot on delicious. Mac n Cheeseburger.Whoop Whoop. Total fat guy food. Kid says the pizza is good. Service has always been good. We ate outside both times we went and their outdoor seating is toasty warm. Infrared heating can't be beat. Did I mention that it was winter time in nevada.
Brent H.,"Reno, NV",0,8,,2.0,1/28/2016,"Eh... That was my reaction to cheesecake factory it's very nice looking inside and the menu is elegant but the atmosphere is that of a Applebee's with the service of a low end diner. Our server wasn't bad but the hostesses seemed to disregard us like sense we were just two younger people we wouldn't spend enough money to get full service or to be informed we could have sat ourselves at one of the first come first serve tables. So after we witnesses multiple people sit before us, after just walking in the door, we found this out just to sit in a crowded restraint with tons of noise, people, and babies crying, to over pay for mediocre food... :/ way over hyped!"
Louis D.,"Reno, NV",71,323,87,2.0,8/13/2014,"There was a time when Paris Hilton was cool.  There was a time when people emulated hedge fund billionaires and Bentleys.  There was a time when women asked you what labels you were wearing, and you thought it was cool wearing Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren, Boss, Guess.  There was a time when driving a Hummer and living in the suburbs and hanging out at malls charging everything and eating at big name chains was cool.  Yes, there was a time when being a corporate lackey dumbsh t was cool, because like everyone was doing it.  Cheesecake Factory was the ultimate high end chain restaurant during those asinine days hanging out at South Coast Plaza getting your car valeted and eating at Wolfgang Puck's.  I've been to Cheesecake Factory in Palo Alto, Newport Beach, Roseville, and Waikiki.  I'm not saying this to brag.  I'm saying it, because I used to be an asinine brand-chasing, corporate lackey moron.  That was before the Great Oil Wars and the Great Recession, and people began to realize that the excessive consumption bubble was an illusion, just borrowing time on a big bomb, a Ponzi scheme.  Millennials have a lot to complain about, but even today, it doesn't seem to have gotten through to them.  They're really screwed.  They'll be paying the rest of their lives for the excessive consumption of Baby Boomers and Gen X'ers who ate at Cheesecake Factory, got their arteries clogged, and need million dollar healthcare while they sit on their fat pensions paid for by none-other than Millennials earning lower pay.  If Millennials were not so caught up in social media and self-congratulatory self-promoting electronic sharing, they'd pick up guns and not just occupy sh t like passive, peasant squatters but overthrow sh t like pissed off revolutionaries.   Until that day, they can eat cheesecake at Cheesecake Factory, sort of a mausoleum of everything that went wrong in the 90's and early 00's.  For me, it's nostalgic.  I've been to this chain with many family and friends especially out of country to show off how Americans do upscale, excessive calorie-chain restaurants like no other nation.  I like the fried tapas/appetizers.  They must have two hundred items on their menus including flatbreads, exotic eggrolls, pizzas, burgers, sandwiches, salads, seafood, pasta, and $20 steaks.  How can they afford $20 steaks?  Well, they're factory, grain-fed sick cows, that's how.  You get sick here, not only from the grease and fat but also the unnaturally raised meats.  The Reno incarnation of calorifically fried gluttony is the smallest version I've been to, and the large glass windows exposing the Forever 21 sign undermines the upscale décor reminding you that you're in some cheesy shopping mall.  The service was outstanding, even though they were packed.  I can only imagine, most of the people were from California and were reminiscing and probably the exact same people who lined up for blocks when In'n'Out opened.  But that's what this is, reminiscing and nostalgia.  I had a roommate who liked to eat baby food.  Now, that's taking nostalgia to the extreme, although arguably, many of us still drink milk.  I'm probably only going to come here once a year for sake of nostalgia, just like I'll hit up Fatburger probably only once a year or have a McRib once a year.  You can't deny that you had some good times back in the day and certain things, albeit unhealthy for you today, help bring back some good memories, but if you really want to do yourself and the world a favor, I'd stick with the local restaurants that serve healthier food without the preservatives, GMO, antibiotics (which will eventually kill us all by creating superbugs), and growth hormones (which make men grow boobs and women grow facial hair).  Unless you've been living under a rock the last decade or perhaps been living only in Reno and not getting out much, you'll think this place is the bee's knees and you'll also try to get people to call the area south of downtown Reno, SODO, because, you know, you're a friggin, clueless, corporate lackey moron still living in the 90's."
