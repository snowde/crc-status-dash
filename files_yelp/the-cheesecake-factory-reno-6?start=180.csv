Geneva L.,"Sacramento, CA",185,190,134,5.0,10/15/2014,"Went back for a celebration lunch and it was really delightful. We each had the classic burger, which comes on a toasted and buttered sesame seed brioche bun with mayo, lettuce, tomato, pickle, and red onion. I wanted well, companion asked for medium and both were done to our specifications. We split fries and a salad as our sides. I had a perfect iced tea and my dining companion had a latte which he loved. Our server Ciara was an absolute sweetheart and had just the right level of attention and focus to the dining service, while giving us space. We loved sitting outside on the patio and enjoyed both the meal and the setting. A home run! Overall, what I love about The Cheesecake Factory in Reno is that it is real food that is well prepared, with a focus on consistency, value, and timeliness."
Jeff D.,"Reno, NV",1,27,,2.0,8/20/2014,"We've always loved The Cheesecake Factory and always seem to find one when we're traveling. Recently, this one opened in Reno, where we live, and we were excited. We knew there would be a long wait. There always seems to be a wait at any Cheesecake Factory location. We were quoted a 60-80 minute wait when we got to this location. I took one look around and saw that this location is TINY...and horribly cramped! Now why in the world, in a tourist city near Lake Tahoe, would they build such a tiny location? Granted the mall might regulate it, but then build somewhere else! As we left to go into the mall to shop, I immediately noticed there are not near enough seats for people waiting. People were standing in or very near the dining area, which is highly inappropriate. The food was great as always, but we kept having to wait exceptionally long for drink refills. They had one person on either end of the dining area overlooking the area, presumably to assist with anything as needed, but they never refilled drinks. One of them, obviously an idiot who has no sense of personal space, kept walking by our bar style table and getting too close. It's hard to explain, but whenever she walked by our table, she looked right at us, like she was worried we were going to steal something. At one moment, I thought she was going to kiss me LoL I understand this is a very new location, but it was not planned out well at all. They are going to lose money because people don't like long waits, and that will continue until people just stop showing up. This location should have been three times the size it is, and they should utilize their staff appropriately and train them on manners. We won't be back."
Cathleen C.,"Reno, NV",6,23,17,2.0,1/6/2016,"I have been to the Cheesecake Factory in Reno twice. What times the service was really good and the waiter was very friendly. I love the Cheesecake Factory when I go out of town, however my experience with the one in Reno has not been that great. Both times I have eaten the food at this particular location, it has come out cold when served at the table. I I had the chicken costella and the chicken was cold, however the plate was hot. Last night I went for happy hour and ordered drinks and potstickers. The pot stickers came out right away however, the middle of them was cold and pink. I have to say I have been very disappointed with the quality of food served at the Reno Cheesecake Factory location. I hope to try again and have a better experience because I was so excited when they opened a location in our town."
S. Marie H.,"Sparks, Reno, NV",0,19,1,4.0,9/14/2014,"Was excited to try this location since I've been to others in California before. Went on a Thursday afternoon and was seated right away.        I had the Hibachi Steak and my husband had the lunch special of a personal pepperoni pizza and Caesar salad. The flavor in my dish was excellent, but the steak had not been prepared to the temperature that I had specified, which was medium rare ( It was more rare. ) I decided not to send it back since I was pretty hungry. My husbands lunch special was a great amount of food for the price and very tasty. I tried a bit if his salad and the Caesar dressing was delicious - very homemade tasting.            Service was good considering they have just recently opened. Server was polite and was always around to check on us."
Mason A.,"Reno, NV",0,20,,4.0,8/6/2014,"Recently opened and had to try it. Went for lunch on a Tuesday about 11.  lots of good service, seated right away, server was prompt , friendly and very pleasant.   The menu is very detailed with many choices. Prices were competitive, The décor is very massive and detailed but very well done.   The manager stopped by to welcome us and chat a bit about our experience. Food was exceptional,  well plated and prepared, service was attentive, warm and friendly. This is a delightful new dining experience for Reno. We will go back."
Erika L.,"Reno, NV",190,31,44,4.0,12/7/2014,"Pros: Large menu to choose from. I loved the many low calorie options which I didn't expect in a cheesecake factory!  Regular cheesecake was amazing. Our guest had the tuxedo cheesecake and the lemon cheesecake. They said it was the best ever. Cons: SLOWWWWW. We went there during lunch and it was two hours before we were out. Be prepared. The low carb cheesecake, what a disappointment; they serve it frozen. Most certainly worth going to. Lunch time is better than the dinner hours. If you go a dinner time, expect a long wait for a table."
Rudy L.,"Reno, NV",100,32,3,2.0,8/15/2014,"Arrived at 7. Seated at 9:22 (told we would be seated by 8:23). Left at 11.  National chain restaurants don't take a month ""to get it right"" (as an earlier review asked us to give them). They bring in corporate openers/managers, their total system is installed, and that's is how it is. Day one. The inability of the computerized system to estimate seating time isn't going to get better (well, people will stop coming). And it is absolutely not OK for it to be so far off. The food is fine. The servers were all nice. The renovation of the space is nice-- the outdoor seating especially. After a 2.5 hour wait, wildly underestimated by the system, the whole damn meal should have been comped, AND it should have  been food of the gods. Our server was awfully sorry everything took so long, and nothing was done to compensate for our time. And it wasn't food of the gods. Stars are for the outdoor seating and the staff who showed grace under pressure. In truth though, I'd give it a zero, since the experience was so bad I'll not go back to this location."
Paul M.,"Incline Village, NV",5,4,9,5.0,12/15/2014,"Took my girlfriend for a late night dinner and sat at the bar. Food, drinks, service, and ambiance were all top notch. Our bartender/server Joey never mentioned that we walked in 20 minutes before the kitchen closed and was very polite and helpful especially when it came to sharing his personal preferences. Overall, great place and will be back."
Jess H.,"South Lake Tahoe, CA",0,31,54,5.0,9/5/2015,"Kennedy was my waitress and I appreciate how nice and attentive she was. I usually eat alone and, not that it really matters, I don't dress all that nice. I go out to eat a lot and way more often than not I'm treated like dirt. I assume it's because of my appearance and the fact that there is only one person on the tab. Kennedy kept my water full and gave service with a big kind smile. If possible I would ask to sit in her section, you won't regret it"
Ron G.,"Sun Valley, NV",1,18,1,3.0,8/23/2015,"My wife, son and I went last Friday. There was a waiting line which I hate, well  we got herded into the bar for our 45 minute wait. Then my son said they are ready to sit us down. Not really thou, now we are waiting by the hostes table behind 2 more couples. I told the lady I was more comfortable sitting at the bar than standing in another line. She smiled and said not too much longer. I forgot I'm getting the thrill of getting the chance to eat at the Cheesecake Factory. We get to go to our table and it was where the screened in area is, I seen 9 empty tables and asked the lady sitting U.S. Why are people waiting when there are tables here. She gave me the cheesecake smile and said we are doing the best we can. Then before I could settle my but cheeks into the seat a waitress comes by and said can I help you? She is standing there with the lady that just sat us down. I said we just sat down give us a minute, this time I did not get the cheesecake smile and concluded I pissed her off. Oh well. I think the illusion of a waiting line is suppose to give you the idea of a great place to eat and while you wait you get to buy expensive drinks. Why else would there have been 9 empty tables when we were being seated. Restaurant trickery I think. I use to deliver food to restaurants for 11 years and I know some of there tricks, a common one is they will buy smaller plates for the illusion of a lot of food another one is thick glass for your drinks. It is still 8 ounces but looks like a quart. I will say the food was very good. Portions were good. I will also say if there is a waiting line I will turn and go some place else. The thrill and  opportunity to eat at the Cheesecake Factory wasn't there for me."
Michelle J.,"Vallejo, CA",5,25,1,4.0,2/16/2015,"Had my Birthday dinner at the Cheescake Factory last night.  The wait was HORRIBLE, over an hour.  Not their fault and they handled how busy it was very well!  The food was good, a bit pricey but you know that walking in.  The brought me a beautiful slice of Red Velvet Cheesecake with my name written in chocolate and sang to me.  Very nice touch!! The manager I believe did a great job helping out the insanely busy servers by refilling drinks.  The server was Meh, no ketchup after asking a few times and manager was only one who refilled drinks. Great Birthday dinner overall!"
Brook M.,"Carson City, NV",0,34,,4.0,12/12/2014,I gave this place 4 stars because even though it was extremely busy and I even had a 10 minute wait the service was wonderful and the food was delicious.  I loved the atmosphere.  I would recommend the peppermint bark cheesecake for dessert. I don't even like cheesecake but that was a flavor explosion in my mouth. It was so good.  I would definitely recommend this place :)
M C.,"Reno, NV",9,32,,5.0,12/3/2014,"I'm a CF fan from way back!!  When I heard CF was coming to Reno, I jumped for joy and told everyone they HAD to try it out as soon as it was open!! I have since been to the new one in Reno about 3 times, and they delivered as expected!!  GREAT FOOD, GREAT SERVICE!!   On my first visit, when we arrived, we were told the wait was 30 minutes, but we waited 45 minutes, if not a little more. The wait time MUST be more accurate. I see in a lot of the reviews this is a consistent problem. My last visit there was no wait, but I can see they do need to improve in this area. CF is a bit pricey, but what you get for what you pay is very reasonable. Desserts? OMG!!!! YOU MUST TRY THEM ALL!!! As far as entrees go, the Chicken Madeira...please, an all time favorite and a MUST TRY if you like chicken! With over 200 items on their menu, CF has got something for everyone. Otherwise, what can I say?? SUPER PROPS AND A BIG SHOUT OUT TO CF!!! :) BOTTOM LINE: 5 STARS FOR FOOD, QUALITY, QUANTITY, SERVICE, AMBIANCE, PRICING FOR QUANTITY IS VERY FAIR IMHO **IF YOU'VE NEVER BEEN TO A CF, YOU HAVE TO TRY IT ONCE. IF ANYTHING, FOR THEIR NUMEROUS CHOICES OF SINFUL, DELECTABLE, CHEESECAKES!!**"
Mary S.,"Magnolia, TX",76,57,336,2.0,10/30/2014,Food is mediocre.  Kitchen extremely slow.  Service is disorganized and inexperienced. You want cheesecake fine.  Anything else... Skip it.  Would not return.
Rick G.,"Reno, NV",8,33,6,2.0,12/18/2015,Took my nephew and niece here on a Sunday afternoon just before five and was told there would be a thirty minute wait unless we wanted to eat outside on patio - we opted to wait and sit inside but when they texted us to sit down the hostess walked us out to the outside patio - rather than get angry we just sat down and made the best of it - the waitress took over ten minutes to even acknowledge us - I had the meatloaf which was very salty but was served hot - the service was sub par at best and the Resturant wasn't very clean especially the floors - this was my first experience at the RENO location and was not like the other locations I have been to (salt lake city + San Francisco) it will be awhile before I try this place again - the value for what you pay seemed a bit high to me.
Shelby B.,"Sparks, NV",62,161,14,3.0,9/29/2014,"Let's get this out of the way - three stars is not bad.   I went in with a poor attitude to begin with as Cheesecake seemed to push out a local restaurant.  Fight the man, and all.   However, service was very good and our lunch of flat bread pizza was just fine.  I do feel they have the tables way to close together, so conversations might was well be shared with the people next to you.  All and all though, that is my only complaint. Not my first choice, but certainly not a bad choice."
Alyss E.,"Carson City, NV",0,1,,1.0,2/20/2017,"HORRIBLE!!!!  This was the biggest waste of 2.5 hours I have ever spent... 1) We were told it was a 15  minute wait for our table and it was 30 minutes. 2) Our waiter came to give us menus and we wanted to place a drink order.  He said, I'll bring waters and then we can order... so we waited... for waters... 3) about 10 minutes later... our waiter returned and asked if we were ready to order.  Sure... he went to my mom first, then I placed mine and as soon as I stated my lunch order he asked my sister what she wanted to order... well, I wanted a drink order.. AS WE STATED WHEN THE WAITER FIRST APPROACHED US!... 4) our table waited AT LEAST 20 minutes before the waiter came back and told us that the bar was ""on it"" and our drinks will be up soon... 5) I ordered the Blood Orange Martini and it was served in a tall glass.... WTF am I ordering a MARTINI that is NOT being served in a MARTINI GLASS!? 5) Our food was FINALLY served to us...  mine and mom's... but no one else from our party... a few minutes later came my sister's and my fiancee's... and then a few minutes AFTER THAT came my grandmother's and father's! 6) When I looked at my pasta dish (the Farfalle something or other) it looked like it had a coating of wax over it.  I asked my sister (who also works SI) and she said that it looked like it sat under the heat lamp for about an hour (about how long we were waiting for our food, coincidence?) 7) My  fiancee ordered his burger ""medium"".  The waiter said ""some pink?"" Sure...  But when it came... RED... BLOODY... GROSS! 8)At that point my one year old was ""being a one year old"" and was getting fussy so I decided to take him out of the restaurant before he disturbed other diners... So I didn't even get to experience the rest of the shitty experience that my family told me about later.  Apparently, my grandmother's meal was comped because although she was adamant about no mayonnaise on her sandwich, it was still included.  But that was no excuse for the absolute shit show that occurred today.  I will NEVER return! Why can't I give a zero rating...?"
Emy J.,"Reno, NV",10,5,5,1.0,11/8/2015,"Food was ok but your service is horrible! No one asked if we needed water etc. I had to go to the bar to ask for water. The hostess, Hannah, was standing around giving dirty looks and giving unpolite remarks."
S. B.,"Reno, NV",0,9,,1.0,3/15/2015,"All the hype about this place from my friends, I had to try it, since I've never been to one ever. Well, first visit, they screwed up on my pasta scampi, which I asked for no tomatoes on it and it was all over my plate when I received it. The server apologized and had them make me a new one. That came and it was so so SALTY, but no tomatoes. The mngr came over and asked if everything was good now and I said no. I can't eat it because it's so salty. She apologized and said they probably had to much salt in the water when they cooked the pasta. I decided to skip the pasta and order the Fish and Chips which was pretty good. However, the fries were burnt and the server even noticed it when she brought it out and asked if I wanted new ones. I said no, since I had been waiting a long time at this point because of the pasta fiasco. I just ate the fish.  So a month later my husband wanted to try this place. He ordered a simple bacon cheeseburger ""medium"" cooked. It came out RAW. They took it back since he only took one bite and they brought him the same burger. By the time the burger came back, I was already done with my meal. The mngr on duty had the nerve to tell my husband that in the future ask for it ""Medium Well"" and it will come out ""Medium"". Really? How about working out the kinks of your kitchen where the food is good and consistent each and everytime. We could have easily paid $5+ (ala carte) at 5 Guys up the street for a COOKED burger and saved $8, since the burger was like $13 bucks. Poor quality of food and managers aren't customer service oriented.  This place is OVER EXPENSIVE for the quality of food they serve. Won't be back."
