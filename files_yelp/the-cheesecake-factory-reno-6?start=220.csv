Carla M.,"Sparks, NV",2,33,7,3.0,9/26/2014,"Let me start by saying that the cheesecake is AMAZING! Maybe this restaurant should just be a bakery, because the actual entrees were underwhelming. It gets 3 stars because of their stellar selection of delicious cheesecake, and because the staff was very fast & friendly. I love that they have special parking for those who place takeout orders, and then deliver the order right to your car.   We originally thought the entrees had very reasonable prices - but judging by the quality of the food, they might be a bit over priced. I got the Chicken Bellagio and my boyfriend got the Meatloaf Entrée. The portions are gigantic, so at least you get a lot of food for the price, but the quality isn't so great. The ""crispy coated chicken breast"" I received was soggy and didn't have much flavor. Also, the menu says it comes with parmesan cream sauce pasta.  We ordered for take-out so maybe they forgot to include the cream sauce? In any case, the pasta just tasted like it was dipped in olive oil and sprinkled with parmesan. The Meatloaf had pretty good flavor, but it was spicy. My boyfriend hates spicy food, so it would be nice if they put a warning on the menu next to foods that will be spicy. He ordered a rather pricy side salad, which disappointingly consisted of a small handful of lettice, 1 slice of tomato, and ranch dressing.  The real joke was the appetizer! We ordered the stuffed mushrooms and it was the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen. So ridiculous, in fact, that I had to take a picture. For seven bucks, we received 5.2 miniature mushrooms with stuffing that tasted like someone took a blow-torch to the top. Stuffed mushrooms are one of my top favorite appetizers, so I order them at any restaurant where they're available. These were the most pathetic little chunks of food I've ever eaten. I almost channeled my inner Gordon Ramsey, and had visions of throwing them against a wall in disgust.   For dessert, we got the S'Mores cheesecake, which is drool-worthy. It has a graham cracker crust, with chocolate ganache and fluffy marshmallow on top. Probably the best cheesecake I've ever had! The serving size is huge. We both had three little bites and had to take the rest home. All in all, I would return to this restaurant again, but probably just for the cheesecake. We have a family luncheon scheduled there for next week, so I'll get to taste a different entrée and see if it's any better than my first go-around. Maybe I'll tell my least liked family member to order the stuffed mushrooms :)"
A.j. P.,"Palm Springs, CA",113,12,7,5.0,7/30/2015,Really can't beat their happy hour menu. The nachos are so YUM! Also the burger is awesome for $5.50
Laura M.,"Sparks, NV",20,39,32,2.0,4/3/2015,"First time here, not impressed. The waitress was super nice and she tried her best to wait on all the tables she had in spite of how busy she was. The food is not that great, had the hot spinach dip as appetizer and it tasted like the TGIF frozen dip. I had the triple cheese pasta, and it was not good at all, the cheese was only half melted and the sauce was just pure ragu. Both my fiancee and I got cokes to drink, his tasted like alka seltzer (even after asking for a second ""fresh"" glass) and mine just tasted like water mixed with a bunch of sugar (yes, I know soda is mostly sugar but it does not taste like pure sugar either), definitely did not get our money's worth. Needless to say, don't really understand why people in Reno were going so crazy about this restaurant, just another chain restaurant."
Kawika P.,"Kalaoa, HI",19,58,109,5.0,9/13/2014,"Never fails! Our waitress Taylor was awesome! Friendly, attentive and quick! She's a keeper! The food was great too! Bistro Shrimp Pasta and Asian Chicken Salad!"
Annette P.,"San Leandro, CA",71,160,60,4.0,7/21/2015,Tried this restaurant for the first time when I was in Reno earlier this year.  I had never been to one of these chains.  I was pleasantly surprised. It was really good and the menu has so many choices - something for everyone.  I had the Tiramisu Cheesecake; probably the best cheesecake I've ever had!  Yum!
Abdul Z.,"Reno, NV",89,18,9,5.0,6/2/2015,"I dined at the Cheese Cake Factory and it was a genuinely friendly and delicious experience. Today I tried the Steak Diane, with Deep Fried Macaroni Balls. And the Stuffed Cheese Garlic Bread. For dessert: their famous Cheescake that started it all. Freaking amazing."
Linda K.,"Reno, NV",70,62,,3.0,7/11/2015,They are out of regular ice tea. Humm. It's a corporate restaurant.  It's still pricey for lunch. What I ordered was ok. Evelyn's pasta. I was almost done with my food before the people next to me were served even though they were there ahead of me.   Service was as usual in a corporate restaurant annoying. They asked if everything was ok before the first bite and had no idea why I laugh. Also tried to take my plate twice and I wasn't finished.
Yvette D.,"Reno, NV",1,45,20,4.0,5/15/2016,"The food is good,  The service is good, but the cheesecake is what makes the cheesecake factory worth the visit. The little bit pricey, but like I said cheesecake is the best part of the Cheesecake Factory."
Lisa H.,"Auburn, CA",13,17,,5.0,3/28/2015,"First I need to say our server Nicole was AWESOME! Haven't had service like that in a while! The food was great! My husband had Bang Bang Chicken & Shrimp with brown rice and he loved it so much we're probably going back in a few days! We ended our meal with their Ultimate Red Velvet Cheesecake, which was very yummy! Other than having some obnoxious people sitting next to us, the meal was perfect!"
Matilda Q.,"Reno, NV",0,53,,2.0,4/23/2016,"WAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY overpriced.  Food isn't that good, desserts are absurdly expensive.  Loud, and very yuppy."
Leanna S.,"Carson City, NV",2,24,,3.0,7/6/2015,Wanted to try something new. It's overpriced with lack luster portions. The wait time for our food took forever! Server was polite and the place was tidy. I will not be going back tho.
Ken L.,"Reno, NV",7,23,7,3.0,6/22/2015,My wife and I went to the Cheesecake Factory for dinner and it was super busy.  They were low on waitresses but they still got us seated right away.  We were waiting for our food for quite a while and soon we started to realize that everyone around us was getting their food before us.  No one had stopped to see how we were doing and finally we had to get the waitresses attention and she said oh I thought you already got your food.  She soon brought us our food. The food and cheesecake were very good.
Brit Y.,"Reno, NV",2,9,2,3.0,2/11/2015,"My Mom and I decided to try out The Cheesecake Factory since we've enjoyed the Roseville location a lot. For being extremely busy on a Sunday the wait time was very quick. We were told 10 minutes and we were seated before the 10 minutes were up. While waiting my mother used the restroom and she said they were extremely dark. The way the hostess calls you up to be seated we had to wait for someone else to come seat us which was odd to us. We were seated at the tables that are half booth, half chairs. That part is fine but the spacing of the tables weren't spaced evenly and the table next to us was right there, we could hear their entire conversation. It felt like we were squished in the corner and they just tried to squeeze us in. The waitress kept squeezing into the small gap between the table next to us and ours. It was extremely awkward and unappetizing while we were eating with her butt inches away from our food. I wish I thought to take a picture of the tight fit. My Mom had to block the bread with her had so it didn't get hit.  On the plus side the food was delicious. We shared the crab cake bites, mushroom, avocado, zucchini fries and split their bacon BBQ burger. We didn't care for any of the side sauces that accompanied each dish. We asked for sides of ranch and bleu cheese. Both the dressing were very good.  Overall.. if it wasn't for the good food, we would not go back. Next time a booth will be requested."
Z N.,"Reno, NV",0,24,1,5.0,2/18/2015,"Great food.  It goes against everything I think a restaurant can do successfully, but does it perfectly.  Usually if I see an extensive menu at a restaurant I immediately know that I am probably in for a mediocre meal, but the Cheesecake Factory has changed my belief in that.  We have been there half a dozen times and no one in my family has had a bad meal yet and it has one of the most extensive menus I've ever seen.  They have a fantastic separate healthy menu with wonderful dishes that will fill you up.  The service is great and the deserts, especially if you are a cheesecake fan, are unbelievably good.  My one complaint, which is really a testament to how good this place is, is that there is often a long wait, so either go in an off time or when you don't mind looking around Meadowood Mall while you wait for their text to be seated."
Scott T.,"INCLINE VLG, NV",0,3,,2.0,8/6/2015,"Met a couple friends for dinner last night and was excited that there was finally a Cheesecake Factories in Reno. I have been to many others and always enjoyed them. Unfortunately, that was not the case with this visit. I have not had such a bad restaurant experience in a long time. Now, I know mistakes happen and nobody is perfect, but when the service is bad and then the food is bad, its inexcusable.   I arrived and found my friends already seated. Our waitress promptly came to the table and asked if we were ready to order, I just sat down. She took our drink order and upon delivering the drinks, asked if we were ready to order. She came back 3 times in less than 5 minutes to ask if we were ready to order. Apparently, she had asked my friend multiple times if she was ready to order even before we got there. I like the enthusiastic approach, but seriously, give me time to read the encyclopedia sized menu. I ordered the eggplant parmesan, my favorite, and substituted plain pasta with marinara instead of the pesto pasta. One friend ordered a breakfast plate and the other, fettuccini alfredo with chicken. When our food arrived, I had the wrong pasta (this did not surprise me), the bacon on the breakfast plate was so over cooked it was inedible, and the alfredo was huge with only 4 small chunks of chicken. When they brought back my eggplant with the correct pasta, it was cold, overly salty and undercooked. I NEVER not eat my food but had 3 bites and pushed it aside.  When I informed the waitress of my dissatisfaction, she sent the manager over to speak with us. I didn't go into details regarding all the issues, just the eggplant dish. The manager agreed that the eggplant dish was salty and that was because of the way it is prepared. Not a very satisfying answer but at that point I just wanted to leave. She removed the eggplant dish from the check and offered to get me something else but we were over it and ready to go.  Definitely won't be in a hurry to return to this restaurant."
Anthony R.,"Mission Bay, San Francisco, CA",0,20,2,2.0,1/31/2015,"Just ate here again, for the second time. Extremely slow service... Waiter was nonexistent... Had to ask for more drinks but couldn't see clearly that it was empty and was drinking ice. 15 for a chicken sandwich that was soggy and cold.. Will not be coming back here. Also margaritas were extremely over priced based on how tiny they are. This location ruins the Cheesecake Factory for me... Will not be returning"
Hannah M.,"Reno, NV",0,11,1,5.0,2/27/2015,Had a GREAT Dinner here! We were seated promptly and it was a busy Friday night! Our server was William W. And he was wonderful so attentive and personable!!!!!!!
Ducky S.,"Reno, NV",120,20,3,2.0,4/19/2015,"This is one of my favorite places back east to eat at. Everything is always perfect and delicious. My favorite dish is the Vietnamese shrimp summer rolls. I've noticed at this location the rolls get smaller and smaller each time I go back, and it seems like the rice paper is hard. I wasn't thrilled with the Thai lettuce wraps either as the portions of the wrap ingredients seemed really stingy. I never minded it being expensive back east bc of the quality but this location really is falling short. I don't even want to get any more of my favorite dishes there because  afraid of being disappointed again. I think I will just wait till I'm back east again visiting."
Katy K.,"Marina del Rey, Los Angeles, CA",56,25,1,4.0,3/14/2015,"I love Cheesecake Factory. The food is right on par with the other CCF I've been to, but the servers in Reno could use a lesson in service. They tend to be slow and don't pay very good attention to their guests. However, the hostesses are warm and friendly. Some servers are better than others - one walking by and checked in to make sure we were doing okay. He also chatted with us for a minute, which made our experience nice. Try the beet salad with goat cheese! It's awesome! Before I ordered this dish I had never had beets and now I love them."
