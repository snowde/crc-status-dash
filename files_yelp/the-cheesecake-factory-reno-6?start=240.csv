Low S.,"Reno, NV",18,22,2,1.0,3/19/2015,Gosh terrible experience! My server took wrong order. He looks dirty and my mom assumed he was using drugs at work. Never come back
Derek A.,"Sparks, NV",81,73,,4.0,11/24/2014,"I'd been to The Cheesecake Factory several times while visiting Seattle, so I was rather excited to check out the new place in Reno.  I allowed some time for the big rush to settle down before actually going there.  My wife and I chose to go this past Wednesday for lunch around 12:30, which happened to be one of the coldest days of the week at 47 degrees....brrr!   We got there and immediately I knew we'd have to make a decision...wait awhile or sit outside.  Keep in mind that my wife is always cold, even when it's 80 degrees out!  Table for two please...sure, about 15 minutes or immediate seating outside in their heated patio?  Hmm...typically a ""heated patio"" means you have to be right next to the heater or squeezed in between your new best friends to stay warm.  It's Reno so we gambled and chose the patio.  Well, let me be the first to correct myself regarding this particular patio; well positioned and effective heaters that allowed us both to take off our jackets and scoff at winter's breath.  I was quite impressed.   Our waitress was there shortly thereafter to get our drink order as we perused the largest menu known to man....or the restaurant industry.  Seriously, be prepared to take your time going through the page upon page of items to choose from.  How big is this kitchen???!!!  There are all types of food so I'm confident you'll find something you like!  Well, it was lunch so I chose the lunch version of the meatloaf...I mean after all I need to watch my figure and not be a glutton!  My wife decided to have the ""Skinnylicious Turkey Burger"" and salad.  Additionally we sprang for appetizers with the ""TexMex Eggrolls"".   We didn't have to wait long for our appetizers which we cleaned out fairly quickly, not because they were extraordinary but because we were famished.  The entrées came shortly thereafter and I was impressed.  I ensured that I ordered the ""lunch"" version of the meatloaf because it looked like a full blown meal.  I was told that it was...wow!  I'm a pretty good eater but this portion was quite large for being the ""smaller"" version of the entrée, not to mention a healthy scoop of mashed potatoes and vegetables.  For a chain restaurant the taste was very good, moist and flavorful.  The mashed potatoes were great as well and somehow kept finding their way to my wife's plate!  Her turkey burger was good and topped with sautéed onions...not exactly ""skinny"" but hey, she liked it and that's all the mattered.  Enjoying the hot meals on the heated patio with the cold weather rolling over the mountains was a really pleasant setting, despite being on the edge of Meadowood Mall.   Then it came time to decide upon dessert which is their namesake after all.  I had to opt for my tried and true favorite, the ""White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle"".  I was not disappointed.  Very creamy with the right amount of texture to what I personally feel a cheesecake should taste like.  No, I'm not an expert but it contains two of my favorite things...white chocolate and raspberry...how could I not choose this?!  My wife chose the ""Dulce de Leche Caramel Cheesecake"".  I can't even pronounce that but she seemed to enjoy it later at home.  I guess she wanted to maintain the ""skinny"" part of her lunch! For an overall dining experience I have to say that I was mildly impressed.  The service and food were above average and I can't argue with the ability to dine outside and be as comfortable (if not more) than being inside.  This particular instance has to be a 4 star rating for me as I'm sure I'll return to see if they can maintain that.  In the meantime I need to hit the gym to work off the goodness!"
Lauren t.,"Sparks, NV",48,22,10,3.0,10/11/2014,"I have been to several other Cheesecake Factories before, so as a fan of the chain was very excited to see that Reno was finally getting one. My friend and I decided to go there tonight for an early dinner. I had heard horrible stories of the wait time and no call head seating. So as you can imagine I was nervous about a long wait. Much to my surprise we were seated in the bar area with in 5 minutes of checking. Our waitress was very nice and took our orders. My friend ordered the garlic noodles with shrimp added and a side house salad, and I ordered Evelyn's Favorite pasta and a side Cesar salad. The waitress asked if we would like our salads first and we both said yes. While we are waiting I have to say they did a really nice job with the decor. My only complaint with the atmosphere is the temperature We were freezing cold, and it wasn't just us the people of the other side of us were complaining about the temperature as well.Within 15 minutes of ordering, our food is brought out. Here is where I have an issue. My friend added shrimp to her pasta dish it was an extra $5 for 4 shrimp. I mean we could have just gone to Red Lobster around the corner and gotten a better deal. We also never received our salads. The restaurant was so busy and all the wait staff seemed super rushed. Not only that, but you could visibly see the waiters going to the managers and letting them know about a complaint, or a ticket that needed to be changed. Call me old fashioned, but I thought that is supposed to be done off the floor? There was no time to stop and enjoy the experience. It was May I take your order, here is your food, are you all done with this, and here's your check. Overall: Food - not as great as the other locations, just really bland  Staff- nice/friendly, but way too visibly frantic  Drinks- delish I recommend the mango crush  Price- it's a bit much for what your getting, and they aren't exactly Claim Jumper portions Will I return? To be determined"
Renee S.,"Carson City, NV",2,117,,2.0,6/19/2015,"I just ordered wrong.  The restaurant is nicely done but extremely loud. We sat at the bar orders a couple three dollar ice teas. We also ordered food.. Flat bread and a hamburger with green salad . Twenty minutes pass...now I know it's not a fast food place and if I wanted something immediately I would have gone to the food court,  finally the food comes out. The flat bread was soggy, ,bland and  a poor choice on my part. The hamburger was well, a hamburger. Cooked to the right temperature it was fine.  I returned the flat bread, talked to the manager and ordered a tossed salad.  It was nicely done.  Nothing special but ok.  More than likely the visit will be our first and last."
Bill J.,"Reno, NV",157,86,30,1.0,8/18/2014,"Got a chance to test run the new place on their friends and family and enjoyed my first experience. Talked a friend into a drink at the bar and when we showed up were told it was an hour wait, dining only allowed at the bar. I guess I need to wait 90 days to get into the bar for a drink only or maybe they keep dining only and I continue to pass on the wait."
Brendan E.,"Monrovia, CA",22,77,7,2.0,11/16/2014,After reading a lot of reviews on here I was surprised at the bad reviews. Cheese cake factory is usually top notch. I frequent the cheese cake factory a lot. I live in California and always go to the arcadia and pasadena location. My normal menu choice is the spicy cashew chicken with white rice. It's normally moist and full of flavor. Sadly the meal I got tonight was not up to cheese cake standard. It was dry with little sauce and was an overall disappointment. Comparing this cheesecake factory to the ones I'm used to going to this one gets two stars.  I was asked if everything was okay and I'm not one to send my order back so i said yes. I would have given less stars but Lindsey our server with a delight and very friendly and did a great job. She was the one bright spot of my visit.
April L.,"Sparks, NV",2,25,101,4.0,12/4/2014,"We sat at the bar and was served by Charisse, who provided excellent service. She was very informative, attentive, and friendly. My Enchilada Stack was delicious as always and served quickly. I've never had a bad cheesecake here. This time, we tried the Lemon Merengue, which I highly recommend. Great experience overall. I'm very happy to finally have a Cheesecake Factory in Reno."
Natalie-Felix U.,"Carson City, NV",0,11,,4.0,10/8/2014,"Okay, I know you're not supposed to review if you're connected to employees or you get freebies... But I get food home almost every day from the restaurant because my sister works there... And I still chose to go and eat there and pay for something I pretty much got for free every day. I think that means a lot.  I've eaten a lot of things from there. My sister Tina has worked there since before it opened and we even went to the staff appreciation breakfast and got to try a LOT of the menu. But this review is about the times I've been there and paid for food, so I'll stick to that.  Our waiter was J something. My sister and I went in late August after the premier of the new Doctor Who series and we got hungry after. Tina and I squeaked in just before closing. Everyone pretty much knew her, but since it wasn't her shift she didn't really know them. Our waiter was cool, he brought out Tina's and my drink without asking (And he got it right). I kinda like going places where they know your habits! So we ordered. I can't remember what Tina got... I think it was a French dip, but not sure. I'm pretty sure I ate it the next day because she won't eat leftovers. I remember it was good, really good, but I never pay attention to what she orders. I got the smokehouse burger, extra bbq for the fries. It was really super good, and I didn't finish it then, but I did about four o clock in the morning, right before I took her back so she could work.  We had the Oreo cheesecake. That... didn't really make it home. The slice of cheesecake is HUGE, and we had trouble finishing it size wise, but it was so good we were fighting over the last bite.  I like the environment. We were there at about ten at night and while the tables are close together, it was pretty quiet. I love the decor too. It's so pretty, like a Wonderland in the middle of the mall."
Stacey K.,"Reno, NV",0,7,,4.0,8/23/2015,"The food was good, not worth price I don't think, but good nonetheless. I really don't think the burger I ordered was worth the $13 when I can go to wells and get a burger that tastes just as good if not better at juicys. The kids meals were relatively okay priced but again not worth the cost with the exception of my son's Alfredo which was delicious. My wife and daughter enjoyed their macaroni and cheese burger but their only complaint would be the deep fried mac and cheese wasn't big enough. Cheesecake was amazing! Service was SLOW...and I mean SLOW. the entire process, even though we called ahead, took over 3 hours. This is waiting for tables, ordering food, waiting, eating, ordering again (dessert), eating, waiting for our check (this took forever) and paying. We didn't take forever to eat either but took FOREVER! Would we eat here again? Yes, if there was maybe 2 of us and we had nothing else to do with our day. The staff was nice but the process was just too long that ruined it."
Jenny A.,"Reno, NV",9,14,23,5.0,8/12/2014,"We finally made it to lunch on a Tuesday and there was no wait, yay!  The service was incredible.  My friend got the jambalaya and I tried the shrimp bacon club with salad.  The food was great, we both got desert to go.  Our server was good.  We were dining with small children and the restaurant does not have a changing table nor a garbage can.  Other than those two suggestions we were pleased with the restaurant and staff.  Thank you!"
Charlotte E.,"Reno, NV",7,17,11,2.0,8/14/2014,"Promised a table in 40 minutes, an hour and a half later we were called, we found a table at the bar by then. We had to beg the bartender for menus, he never asked us if we wanted drinks. I know the restaurant is new but we weren't served until 2 hours after we arrived. The food was good but pricey ."
catherine i.,"Reno, NV",12,21,3,5.0,12/17/2014,I am so glad we finally have one here in reno. Come here on the weekdays and get a table really quick. The farfalle pasta with garlic sauce and chicken is amazing. Great place. Love it.
Robert C.,"Reno, NV",16,37,5,3.0,1/29/2015,I've been to three cheese cake factories and this one was the smallest and most crowded. I wished they had chosen a larger space. Probably not the best place for a first date. Food was good.
Lynn E.,"Reno, NV",2,21,,4.0,3/4/2015,"You don't go into a chain restaurant expecting a fantastic meal you can't stop thinking about. At least I don't. My parents came to visit 2 weeks ago and wanted to buy us dinner, my dad is the pickiest person I know, so, we had to choose a restaurant with a lot of options, Cheesecake Factory's menu goes on for days.  Everyone was really pleased with their choices, but I was super impressed with my Habachi Steak. The flavors were perfect, the meat was tender enough for my 7 month old daughter to eat some, the Wasabi mashed potatoes were just spicy enough. I have been thinking about it ever since. If I had the money to spare I'd probably have gone back a couple times since. The only reasons I didn't give them 5 stars is that for being named after it, their cheesecake isn't all that great, definitely tastes frozen and thawed. And my mom's burger was more medium well than medium (that being said she did still think her meal was tasty enough that she wanted to find the closest Cheesecake Factory to their house)."
Vera W.,"Reno, NV",0,3,,1.0,2/2/2016,"Was very disappointed in the quality of the breakfast we were served.  The omelette was minus the mushrooms, green onions and cheese.  When this was brought to the restaurant manager's attention, she stated she would send a gift card for breakfast on her.  Well, the gift card never arrived and when I spoke to her about this, she then said "" I told her to include a gift card"" which has never reached us.  I'm just saying-you might not get what you order and the restaurant must feel one customer doesn't matter."
Brian H.,"Reno, NV",1,17,,1.0,10/4/2014,"I tried coming here the other night with a friend.  We called ahead and were told that there was no wait and to come on down.  When we got there though, and there was a line nearly out the door, I got a feeling that this wasn't quite accurate.  Sure enough, there was nearly an hour wait.  To make matters better, when I brought up that we'd just called ahead, we got the sort of mindless glassy-eyed smile from the girl at the counter that you get from customer service folks of her calibre and was told 'Oh well, I guess you can wait.' I'm not impressed."
Scott B.,"Sparks, NV",2,18,,4.0,1/17/2015,Ate here a few weeks back for first time food was Pretty good just a long wait until you get a table was worth it though
Jeff M.,"McKinney, TX",14,36,22,4.0,8/21/2014,"They really need to work on their pace of service. Arrived at the 11:00 AM opening for lunch.  Order was placed at 11:20, food arrived at noon. Finally was out at 12:30, and it looked like their was a large wait (this was on a Thursday afternoon).  Server was very friendly and attentive, and drinks were always filled. They just need to work with the kitchen on getting orders filled."
Chris P.,"Reno, NV",23,34,24,2.0,9/11/2014,Fist time going. Heard all the hype. Sat for 1 1/2 hours. My girlfriend and I ordered our food then got 2 completely different meals. Then the mgr came and told us there were 3 screw ups. The employees were all very nice. The food was good. Mix up ruined our time there. We sat outside and that was nice. We don't plan on going back anytime soon. We should of went to Thai Lotus. We didn't even try desserts. They did make it right with the bill. And my beer was 8.50
Andrew B.,"Reno, NV",224,6,,3.0,12/30/2014,"it was great food, pricey, major variety, really loud, friendly service, usually busy. they do NOT take reservations. I've called recently and twice they said no reservations. I would give 4 stars if it didn't take so long to get food and if reservations were available."
