Tracie K.,"Reno, NV",102,26,5,1.0,9/1/2014,"While I have heard tons of hype about this place we finally decided to try it.  For a Friday night we were seated immediately, in a corner in a station that was closing down.  Wait staff were cleaning the entire area as we were trying to enjoy a meal after a long day at work. Service was decent.  However, when I ordered my California Cheesesteak sandwich I found little hard bits in it.  At first I brushed it off as gristle from the meat.  Being that I was to full to finish my food I took home the rest to eat at a later time.  When I went to eat the rest of my sandwich I found a chunk of plastic in my food!  I immediately called the store and was told that I would be called by a manager.  Now having worked in the food industry you don't let days go before handling an upset customer.  I chipped my tooth on this plastic and saved it for them with melted cheese on it as well.  As of now I am out a dental bill and a huge dinner bill for a restaurant that I will never visit again. Bottom line, check your food before you eat it or you may be eating extra things you didn't order."
Karen C.,"Reno, NV",1,14,2,3.0,11/4/2014,"Great menu selection, loved the corn tamale appetizers! Ambiance is nice, pasta dishes were average, strawberry shortcake is absolutely WAY too much, 5 people couldn't finish that portion.. but tasty. I'd return but only if I know the restaurant has worked on the very slow service. Staff is nice, but there appears to be a disconnect between the kitchen and timely food to the customer."
Katy E.,"Carson City, NV",3,103,1,4.0,11/14/2014,The Raspberry Lemon Cream Cheesecake is amazing!
Samuel D.,"Reno, NV",9,23,2,2.0,12/12/2014,"Unimpressed. Cramped sitting, horrid wait times, and high price and all that  just for chain quality food? Meh, I don't think so. There are so many better restaurants around that I'll pass on this one."
Alex K.,"Reno, NV",23,19,11,5.0,8/7/2014,"So happy reno has finally got a Cheesecake Factory! And quite possibly the smallest one ever built which suits the Biggest Little City in the World just fine. With that said, you know what you're getting. Great tasting food, good atmosphere and A1 service. But, with any new restaurant I would give it a month to work out the kinks before giving them a genuine review. Also would like to note that even though the menu says ""fresh squeezed"" lemonade it is NOT FRESH SQUEEZED!"
James D.,"Reno, NV",0,1,,1.0,1/22/2016,First time at this location.was excited to eat here because of past experience with other locations. food was good service was okay up until I ordered a cheesecake. it literally took over 35 minutes before I got a tiny 6in $25 cheesecake. I sincerely wish I could get my money back because it was the worst waist of time and money.
Reno Eyelash Extension B.,"Reno, NV",0,11,6,5.0,1/7/2015,"I love Cheesecake Factory, every time I go there I order the same thing....the tuna tarar from the skinny menu.  It is so good.   If you like to be social and don't mind the loudness its a great place and ambiance is great.  I especially like the outdoor covered patio.  I can sit out there in the middle of winter and not be cold at all due to the heaters they have.  Love it!!!"
Wayne D.,"Carson City, NV",0,717,163,3.0,10/26/2014,"I think this place just opened, so their service was slow and chaotic when we arrived around 12:30, and we got seated about a half hour later. Big menu. Oddly enough, I couldn't find a bacon cheeseburger on the menu and had to ask for a BBQ burger and held the onion rings and sauce. It was a nice thick burger and was done exactly as I ordered it. Nice and juicy."
Teresa F.,"Reno, NV",0,15,4,5.0,8/9/2014,"We've never been to a Cheesecake Factory, this was a first and it was excellent!  We had no idea they served so many food items.  We had the lunch portion of delicious fettuccine alfredo which was enough for 2 people and extra to take home.  They serve warm bread, which was great!  The atmosphere was very nice, we sat on the patio.  The only problem with the patio was the flies, not sure they can remedy this problem?  The staff was friendly and the cheesecake delicious! Our waiter, Fernando was very good and really friendly.  We will definitely be going back soon!  We will always request the patio in warm weather, flies or not....the decor is too cute right down to the chairs!  Felt like we were in California."
Sarra K.,"Sparks, NV",150,115,123,4.0,9/17/2014,I was very happy to see that this restaurant came to reno! I have only been to the one in Sacramento and that place is huge!! The reno one is half the size. We ordered tuna tar tar and chicken simosas for an appetizer and that was delicious! I also got the berry mojito and that was very tasty. For my entree I got the oriental chicken salad. That was tasteless. Super bland. Bjs by far has a way better one! I would definitely come back here but I will be ordering a different entree!
Lauren C.,"Reno, NV",21,13,55,2.0,9/16/2014,"My second visit to the Cheesecake Factory was for dinner on a Thursday night. We waited 45 minutes for a table, which was expected. I was seated and waiting for friends when one of the hostesses was extremely rude the my gf trying to find the table we were already seated at!! She was 9 months pregnant and the hostess was absolutely horribly rude. Lots of attitude. We were seated by the kitchen right under the window that the kitchen connects to the dining area. I killed four flys and gnats at the table. There were flys EVERYWHERE! You could see them inside the glass to the kitchen as well. Needless to say we didn't have much of an appetite after that. I don't think I'll be returning to this location. Which is too bad, because they make a mean Reese's chocolate cake cheesecake."
Dreu M.,"Reno, NV",0,5,,1.0,10/30/2015,Customer service was very unsatisfactory... The wait went from 10 minutes to 1 hour after attempting to seat twice and failed (due to the people didn't leave) huh?!? We had a baby with us in our group and we finally went elsewhere.  The little guy at the front was sure a happy fella...
Brandy P.,"Inglewood, CA",74,17,3,1.0,6/26/2015,"Avoid this place at all causes. I'm mad they made me give it a star it's not worthy of one based on my experience. As we sit awaiting for our drinks that we ordered at least 6 mins prior, we still haven't received our bread nor have we had our orders taken. Okay, maybe they're busy.... I order a Cajun jambalaya pasta, I bite into my chicken and it's wet like, I'm a freak when it comes to undone chicken and when I told my mom in law who had the same dish she says that the chicken is just soft. Wtf! Soft and chicken are two words I don't want to put together. Sorry mom it's not cooked. As I pull all the chicken out and continue to eat the shrimp I am grossed out by a slimy, mushy underdone shrimp. Come on really why are you in business? I'm not a professional cook and I know how to cook a shrimp properly. I was so disgusted and pray that I don't end up sick from my horrible meal. Very bad service from start to finish."
J M.,"Sparks, NV",0,15,,5.0,10/17/2014,"They have wonderful food! We had the beet and goat cheese salad, the tamale corn cakes, garlic noodles, shepherds pie, and lemondades.  It was ALL good! I'm glad they are in Reno now, especially with the skinnyliscious menu! :-)"
Burt M.,"Reno, NV",1,25,23,5.0,9/14/2014,"Went for late lunch on a Saturday,  September 13 around 2:06 ...received text at 2:31 that our patio table was ready.  I would say least waiting times are between 2:30 and 4:30...very efficient podium setup. Wife had Chicken Belagio,  I had Buffalo Hamburger.  If you choose the patio on a midafternoon,  the sun can be quite warm..our server kindly allowed us to move to a center table.  It is VERY pleasant,  airy and refreshing here...try it before winter sets in,  although they have many infrared heaters mounted on the high ceiling. We couldn't have asked for a better experience,  between our EXCELLENT, Friendly, AND efficient waitress, Veronica, the delicious but not crazy spicy buffalo burger,  and the wonderful Chicken Belagio. I am definitely having the Belagio next time after I received a  ' small'  taste! SO full afterwards so we ordered a Caramel Pecan Turtle Cheesecake to go....outstanding. All 37 Cheesecake choices looked tempting!   BTW,  ALL the employees were friendly , helpful and cheerful.... Very positive experience..we are definitely returning."
Jeffrey G.,"Reno, NV",12,10,1,3.0,9/8/2014,The Reno Cheesecake Factory is a standard restaurant of the franchise. This isn't necessarily a bad thing seeing as the franchise provides what they provide and they do it well. They took over the restaurant space where the former 775 Bistro was in the Meadowood Mall and expanded and renovated the space nicely. I went with a couple of friends and we all had a decent experience. If you're a fan of Cheesecake Factory then you should find no problems with this one overall.
Kendra L.,"Sparks, NV",4,7,2,2.0,9/21/2014,"I agree with the people who said ""food is mediocre, cheesecake is Devine"" the service is not the best and our entrees were bland. Environment too small, tables too small and the floors were dirty. We should have taken Our cheesecake to go."
Chey E.,"Reno, NV",1,21,,1.0,8/30/2015,"We went here for our first time a couple weeks ago. We called in our order because our son fell asleep. They stated it would be 20-30 minutes. Right at 30 minutes we pulled up to the area where you can call for them to bring the food out to you. I called immediately. We waited another 15 minutes outside of the 30 minute time frame and our first call so I called again only to be put on a never ending hold. Could I have gone in? Yes! But the reason I ordered to go and used their call service was so I didn't have to wake my sleeping baby. Don't offer a service or time frame you can't keep. We finally got our food at just over 50 minutes from the initial call. My husband ordered the shepherds pie and it was so salty. He would have been better off just eating plain salt. This is coming from a man who salts and peppers everything! I ordered the tacos and they lacked flavor. They were also wet. It was hard to hold. It came with a side of rice which was so full of garlic that I just tossed it. I love garlic everything so for there too be too much garlic flavor, it must have been bad! My sons chicken strips were not any better than the rest of the experience or food so he just ended up eating a peanut butter and jelly from home. The only good part was the Cheesecake. My husband was upset about how awful the whole ordeal was so he called the next and spoke to a manager. Before we could even make the complaint we had to give her our card number to make sure we actually ate there...how ridiculous. She ended promising a gift certificate to him that still hasn't arrived two weeks later. I would avoid the long waits and bad food unless you are going for the cheesecake!"
Debby S.,"FALLON, NV",0,3,,3.0,10/19/2015,"Food was very good. But why do entrees always come out one at a time. So 3 of us were almost done eating and when my husband's food arrived. Shouldn't you serve the table together. So rude! Second time happening, but this time it was a long wait in between waiting for other meals!!!"
C. C.,"San Francisco, CA",0,59,12,4.0,9/18/2014,"I'm so happy Reno finally got a Cheesecake Factory. We were a party of 4 and sat on the patio, which was pretty nice. There is no valet parking at this location that I could see which is different than other locations I have dined at. The service needs a little work (went a full hour without a water refill despite trying to flag down waitress multiple times) so I took a star off but for the most part a great experience. The avocado egg rolls, kale salad, and vanilla bean cheesecake are delicious...."
