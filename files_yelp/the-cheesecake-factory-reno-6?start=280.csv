Keaton C.,"Bettendorf, IA",3,3,,5.0,5/15/2015,My family and I were visiting from Iowa and had a wonderful experience. We have been to several cheesecake factories before in different parts of the country but none of our previous experiences compared to what we experienced in Reno. The food was great as usual but what made us so special was the incredible service. Tawna was our waitress and she was so kind and wonderful! So lucky to have had her. She went above and beyond the entire time. You just don't see enough people like her. She alone made our nights. Wonderful person and we were so lucky to have had her as our server!
Flower M.,"Reno, NV",68,67,76,3.0,3/18/2015,I went for lunch with two friends of mine. We asked to sit at a table so we could all see each other while we visited. They were accommodating. I had the lunch herb crusted salmon thinking it might be a sensible option for someone who is desperately on a mission to watch their caloric intake. I opted for the asparagus as my side. Which both tasted fantastic but when I got home I researched the calorie count of my food because I also go the low carb cheesecake. The whole meal weighed in at over 1200 calories. I'm a little sad that I thought I was choosing all the healthier options. I learned my lesson. Stay far away from the Cheesecake Factory or try on option on their low calorie menu. None of those items seemed appetizing when I was there today. And for the love of God try to find a cheesecake slice that doesn't have more than 400 calories a slice. Lol the low carb cheesecake has about 570 Low carb does not equal low fat when it comes to cheesecake:(. The salmon came in at 757 calories which was surprising to me. Must be the sauce they use.
Lois H.,"Reno, NV",0,7,1,5.0,9/18/2015,This was our first time coming in. There was 7 of us we all had something different. Our server Emily was on top of taking care of us. Our drinks were always full and she always checked back to see if we needed anything else. The food was soooo good and huge portions. We had a great time and we defiantly will be back.
B W.,"Reno, NV",0,10,2,5.0,8/21/2014,"I have been waiting sooooo many years to try this place. I was overjoyed when I heard that one was being built here in Reno. The food was very amazing!!!! I ended up getting a spicy crispy chicken sandwich with the fries I can't even describe the juiciness and the golden crispy perfection if this sandwich it was the BESR sandwich I have ever eaten so far!!! And let's not get started with the choices of cheesecake (which is my absolutely favorite and my weekends) after much consideration I went with the white chocolate raspberry truffle slice oh boy I was in heaven. The prices aren't too bad for the size and yummy was if the food! I also learned that YES you can indeed order a 17"" cheesecake for about $24 and a big while cheesecake for about $40. Our waitress was phenomenal and answered any questions with much ease. Also we got to sit outside on the patio which was perfect since the weather was good and personally I'd rather be outside on warm weather days. The wait time was pretty intense 60-85min but when you have a mall to browse to help waste the time it goes by quickly and they text you when your numbers ready which is awesome so you don't have to wait!!!! I have already recommend so many here and will keep doing so as we'll!!!!"
Alan J.,"Reno, NV",0,2,,4.0,8/18/2014,Food was alright. Little pricey. Sat at the bar and the bartender Nathan was awesome! He helped me and my girlfriend choose a cheesecake to try. We ended up with the herseys chocolate cheesecake and it was amazing!
Johan L.,"Midtown East, Manhattan, NY",0,1,,1.0,6/22/2015,"Terrible service. Monday afternoon, Restaurant more or less empty. Wanted to sit outside but had to wait even if at least 15 tables empty?!"
Joanne B.,"Sparks, NV",0,2,,2.0,8/12/2015,The food was OK but overpriced.  $12.50 for a hamburger or chicken sandwich is gouging.  Won't be back.
Niccole E.,"Reno, NV",0,5,,1.0,7/21/2015,"This was my first visit to the Cheesecake Factory in Reno and I can say this has been the worst experience I have had.  The restaurant was fairly empty so we were seated quickly. However, the waitress tried giving us a table that was right next to an occupied table that had very loud guests. I told her I wanted a different table, and after rolling her eyes, she sat us in a different area.  The food was disappointing. I ordered the four cheese pasta with chicken since it is one of my favorite dishes. As soon as they set the plate down in front of me I could tell it was different from the other four cheese pastas I have had. First, the FOUR CHEESE pasta had no cheese, and I had to scavenge the plate for the chicken. Second, the waitress knocked over my fork and some pasta onto my dress as she was serving parmesan cheese. I was barely offered an apology. The waitress was very inattentive and had a bad mood when she would come by to the table.  I am definitely never coming back to this Cheesecake Factory."
J J.,"Sparks, NV",68,67,48,2.0,1/27/2015,"Blew it again today. I hate giving bad reviews  but goodness I eat there 2/3 times a month and I rarely have things go smoothly.  Our waitress lied to me again today. My friends  food all showed up including  her Ceasar salad coming out first, without my beet salad with it. Her main dish came, after a bit I git my salad.  Then was told my chicken pretzel fingers were dropped on the floor and being remade, when I know exactly  what  happened  because  I served food for 6 years . She forgot to put in my order with my friends order. Instead of telling  me  the truth I was shortly served my chicken  which was so burnt you could smell it across the table. It was still served obviously  burned? She removed  it from the bill and she was very nice . But again a sub par for an 80 dollar lunch. The food is so good but the staff is lacking in a few major ways......I even have issues in curbside  togo. But I'll keep going back because  I love the food, but probably  will  stick to togo, usually  less issues with that. I hope they get better."
Nancy C.,"Sacramento, CA",0,1,2,1.0,6/2/2015,"Went to the Reno Cheese Cake Factory tonight. This is my first yelp review I have ever done. Came from Sacramento to see my Mom for her 70th Birthday dinner here and it was Terrible. Soup was burnt tasting I had to send it back. my sister and I shared her favorite dish and it  was so salty and spicy we couldn't eat it and sent it back and did not re order and my Moms toast was so burnt black that she had to send it back and ask for toast that was not burnt. Total disappointment. Ordered a side of Carmel with our cheese cake and the Carmel arrived with the bill after we had already eaten our cheese cake and they charged us for it! Came hungry and a happy, left hungry and mad! Don't go to Reno cheese Cake Factory."
A M.,"Sparks, NV",0,3,1,1.0,4/16/2015,"Went to the Cheesecake Factory for lunch. I ordered the Eggplant Parm. I asked for Angel hair pasta. They served it with out sauce, it was cold, tough and tasted like rubber."
Shawn M.,"Sparks, NV",0,3,,2.0,3/6/2015,"I was in the mall so I ordered take out.  I was told it would be ready in 15 minutes.  I walked through the mall entrance which is confusing as it is like a back door.  No signage directing you to the hostess station and no signage for takeout anywhere.  I asked the hostess about takeout and she pointed me to the cheesecake counter.  Here I waited, and waited.  Apparently of the 2 people in front of me, the first was paying with cash.  Oh no!  So we waited for someone ""qualified"" to handle actual cash to come over.  This was awhile. Finally this was taken care of.  Now I was at the 25 minute mark.  The only reason I know was because I checked my phone.  I said I had the to go order and told her my name.  She had a manager go get the food from the back.  Unfortunately she never returned.  Another member of the staff finally came out of the kitchen with to go orders. She gave me my order and said ""it should only be a few more minutes, they forgot your fries"".  It was now 40 minutes since I called.  I said I can't wait and left.  It was not busy in the restaurant.  I guess I will try curbside if I ever come back.  I gave an extra star since the chicken sliders were good."
Bruce B.,"Anchorage, AK",1,12,,5.0,3/24/2015,"Sierra RV Super Center in Reno get 5 stars from us because of their efforts to help us when we were stranded with a defective coach. While some dealers said they could not even see us for a week, Sierra's shop manager, Jamie, agreed to take a quick look the next day to access the problem though they were fully booked with work. She had a mechanic look it over and determined that we had to order a new part, which they did. Once the part arrived, again Sierra fixed the coach as soon as possible to get us back on the road. All of the Sierra employees were caring and helpful."
Susie S.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,14,1,1.0,10/21/2015,"Horrible service!!! I called to put in an order for pickup - the girl who answered Demi, told me she would  send me to the bakery for my order and put me on hold. I was on hold for 11 minutes. I hung up and called back and talked to Demi again - I explained I  just called and wanted to place an order  and was on hold for 11 min. She didn't say anything but - oh ok, I guess I'll take your order. I then asked for a manager as she didn't even  apologize or try to act like she cared... I was on hold for 6 minutes and they then hung up on me! I called back to explain I was hung up on and she put me on hold for another 9 minutes until finally a manager came to the phone! I just waited that long to see if he would actually pick up the phone!!! Horrible horrible hostess!!! Will not go back since they really don't care. You need to hire people at the front or on the phone who actually want to work!!  Good food bad service!!!"
Vanessa M.,"Santa Maria, CA",0,48,1,5.0,1/25/2015,Loved my food. Mac n cheese balls were my fav! My burger was juicy & flavorful. Red velvet cheesecake was a nice finish to our meal.
Je'an H.,"DOYLE, CA",0,28,4,5.0,11/1/2014,"The Cheesecake Factory at Meadowood Mall in Reno is the ""New Restaurant In Town. The Cheesecake Factory is a corporate restaurant. As restaurants go, they all have good days and bad days. New restaurants make more mistakes as they have to find that balance that they are trying to attain on a regular basis. New restaurants ""of course"" have the most problems when they are crowded. What sets restaurants apart is the fact that some try harder than others to give you that ""Foodie"" experience rather than just making they're mark as a place to eat. The Cheesecake Factory at Meadowood Mall is one of those restaurants that seem to try harder to give you that all around 'Foodie"" experience rather than just slinging out the chow. The restaurant itself has a nice look and a nice feeling atmosphere with conscientious  employees. You can be seated inside or in the outside courtyard. They also have a bar area where you can also eat. When crowded it can be a bit noisy but it is not uncomfortable or loud. The menu is extensive and is set by the corporate office. I must say somebody at that office knows what they are doing. As extensive as the menu is, one would be hard pressed to find an item lacking in style, flavor, and quality. Me and my wife were lucky to experience the Cheesecake Factory when they were spot on with food and service. This is what good restaurants strive to attain. This is an upscale casual restaurant. The price of the food is at the medium range. Average price for appetizers is $6.00 To $13.00 dollars etc..  Average price for entree's is around the $15.00 to $20.00 dollar range with Fillet Mignon topping out in the $30.00 range. They have two great extensive menu's. A Skinnylicious menu and the Regular menu. The skinnylicious menu is more healthy fair were the regular menu has the main dishes like steak, fish, shepherds pie, meatloaf, and pasta etc.. Both menu's are awesome and original in variety. I have to say the sauces that are served with quite a few of the menu items are very, very good. The food in general is fresh and over the top in quality. You pay for what you get. We ate there on a Friday around 3:00 p.m. We started our dining experience with two appetizers (which we shared) that were very tasty and fun....Yes I said fun.  The Ahi Tartare, and the Thai Lettuce Wraps were fresh, tasty and fun to eat. The sauces that accompanied the dishes were over the top. My wife ordered the Kobe Burger which was perfectly cooked ""Rare"". Not medium rare or medium. it was cooked Rare. And that burger melted in your mouth. ""Over The Top"". My wife chose the soup of the day as a side. It was clam chowder and it was very tasty but cannot compete with the Peppermills Oceano restaurant clam chowder. Again tasty but not enough clam taste for our liking. I ordered their famous meat loaf. I am a picky meatloaf lover. The meatloaf melted in my mouth, the side dish succotash was spot on and the mashed potatoes had a very rich taste to them that lingered on your taste buds for a while. ""Over The Top"". The seasonal pumpkin cheesecake was perfect....That is to be expected after all, it is The Cheesecake Factory. Our waitress was Kimberly who was very helpful and added to our dining experience by waiting on us as if she really cared that we had a good time and a good meal. ""Over The Top"". Other staff that would walk by our table seemed to take notice if a plate was empty and needed to be removed, or if our water in our glass was low etc. Very balanced. The manager ( Lezlie Siegel) of this restaurant seems to know what she is doing and has a vision for what she wants this restaurant to be like, and she seems to be that type of person that will get what she wants to accomplish. Good going ."
P P.,"Reno, NV",0,1,,5.0,9/10/2014,Great food!  Patrons need to dine then leave.  Don't sit there for two hours when there are other people waiting to come in & eat.
Brian H.,"Sparks, NV",1,8,2,3.0,11/29/2014,Food was great and temperature was good. Restaurant is still new so service is a bit haywire
Nicole U.,"Reno, NV",0,20,2,3.0,9/12/2014,"Luckily I looked at the reviews before we left the house and I told the sitter this was going to be one of our longer dates due to the wait times people were reporting here. We visited on a Friday night and we were told the wait would be about 50 minutes. It is great that they take down your name and telephone number and will text you when the table is ready so you can walk around the mall. We ended up waiting 1 hour. I understand, the place is new to this area, in an extremely small location and it's had a lot of hype. Two tips for future Cheesecake Factory goers 1. They don't take reservations and don't have call-ahead seating 2. Don't wear heels! Between the long wait time and the incredibly slick floors, you'll be sorry! We are finally seated and wait 10 minutes for water, 20 minutes for my husband's mojito but I would say the wait for our food wasn't that long. My happiness about the food coming at a reasonable time was short lived because I found two 3 inch roots in my mashed potatoes! I am pregnant, was really looking forward to the mashed potatoes and was very turned off the minute I started digging through my food looking for worm looking roots. Yuck! We were also seated right by the front and people were looking at our dishes when they arrived and talking to us about the food and poking their heads over the half wall. I found that pretty rude and frustrating but there just isn't enough room in this place. We were there so long that we didn't have time to have dessert there so we decided to order to go. Another 20 minute wait for two slices of cheesecake and in that time, I saw two other tables send food back for reasons I couldn't hear. My husband had the BoomBoom shrimp and rice dish and it was amazing, I'll also say my original plain-jane cheesecake was amazing but it was such a long wait and time seated that I'll only be coming back to pick up desserts to go."
Kimberly M.,"Carson City, NV",0,12,,5.0,9/21/2014,"I went here for my 21st birthday and was quite impressed. The place was packed, and although we were told it would be a 50-70 minute wait, we were seated in 30 minutes. Despite how busy it was, our server, Kim, was very attentive and pleasant. I had the italian sandwich with fries with a mango cocktail. All of it was great, but the fries were not anything special. I also got a tiramisu cheesecake for dessert - yummy! Not too sweet or heavy. Pricing is not too bad, but you do get what you pay for with portion sizes. I can't wait to return and try more of their massive menu!"
