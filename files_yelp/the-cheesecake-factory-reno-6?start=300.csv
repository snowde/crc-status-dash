Douglas C.,"Reno, NV",0,1,,5.0,3/23/2015,"Last night my co-workers and I went to The Cheesecake Factory for a store celebration, and we were not expecting the type of service we received. We had a large group of ten or so with a couple different tabs, so we were expecting slight confusion but that was not what we got. Our waitress was Rebecca F. and she was phenomenal! She got our drink orders promptly and was extremely patient as we picked appetizers. Once we were ready to order she took the order and kept getting bread for our group as we waited. She was attentive to our group making sure to refill our drinks. The appetizers and the few entrees ordered came out promptly, and everything tasted amazing. Rebecca talked with us while she was at our table making it a more personal experience. We ordered cheesecake as well of course and when they brought it out they placed candles in them, and decorated our store managers plate to celebrate for us. Rebecca brought some other servers to applaud our staff and congratulate our staff. It was really an amazing experience."
A. H.,"Reno, NV",0,91,,2.0,9/21/2014,"This place and location is very mediocre. It took them forever to seat us. I think 30 mins after our estimated time. There's many employee so hustling and bustling around for a small restaurant really not doing anything. Ahh. Awkward. It's not that big of a restaurant to manage. Anyways we had a few drinks at the bar (great service, good drinks.). Finally seated. Our waitress, excuse my language was such a ditz. First, we were seated, no silverware, no napkins, no water. All standard btw. I've never worked in a restaurant but I've eaten out enough to know this. Anyways, we kept having to ask, can I get more butter, another glass of water, maybe more water, another napkin (since I asked for one and she didn't bring one for my guest). Nothing horrible, just really ditzy service. I liked the outdoor seating on a nice evening and the music was relaxing. Oh, the food was good but expensive for dinner. Thanks for the experience but the employees need more experience."
B S.,"Reno, NV",0,7,,4.0,9/2/2014,"Busy, busy, busy, been there 3 times and the wait has been 45 to 75 minutes. But they are a very well known chain restaurant. The wait staff is good and hopefully will get better with time. The food and the cheesecake selections menu must weigh 4 pounds, but I am not complaining. More choices is the best to me. The restaurant is small in size but has a full bar. Seating in the booths gives you the impression of privacy. The noise of the music and the other patrons was loud. Had to talk over the noise and really had to listen to the wait staff when ordering. The food and cheesecake was very good and worth the wait. Will be making this restaurant the special occasion restaurant. Restrooms were clean and well maintained. The busboys for some reason were being kept busy cleaning the floor next to our table. Did not see anyone spill anything on the floor. The uniforms on the wait staff were very professional looking. Parking at the MeadowWood Mall is a bear at anytime near the restaurant location. Try to arrive at least an hour before you want to eat. They have cell phone paging and the vibrating pager if you don't want to give them your cell number."
