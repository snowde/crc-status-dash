Nancy V.,"Reno, NV",261,708,901,3.0,9/4/2016,"Yep - I agree with just about everyone else. It is A-OK. Nothing fantastic, definitely not horrible, but . . . . . it is a chain. We were at the Mall, it was lunch time, we were hungry, we had not been here, and what the hell, why not. Better than the mob scene at the food court.  We went in, and were seated right away - no wait. The space looks totally different from when it was 775 Gastropub. It seems a bit opulent and over the top in a Vegas plastic/glittery sort of way. tables are a bit close together and it is really hard not to hear the conversations on either side. We were seated in the bar area and could look out through the glass on the back of the bar to the patio outside. The patio looks like a nice addition to the space.  We were greeted by our server and offered drinks and were given time to look over the ginormous menu. I guess they want to have a little bit of everything in case a food fusser might show up.  We ended up with sandwiches - I had the Classic Club and my husband had the Chicken Parmesan both with fries. My sandwich was OK. It was HUGE, but but pretty standard. The lettuce was shredded (a big no-no in my book) and the tomatoes were fresh, but had no flavor. The bacon was crispy, but cold and the enormous wad of sliced turkey tasted processed. It really wasn't awful, it was just uninspired. The fries, however, were really good. Piping hot and crispy, not too much salt, and served in a paper cone in a silver cup. Classy.  We did not have any cheesecake - I know, it is their signature item. Maybe another time. We were quite full and had lots of leftovers to take home for another meal.  I would not go out of my way to eat here again, but if I was at the mall, I might consider it. It is a nice alternative to the fast food court."
Bettina F.,"Reno, NV",5,50,4,5.0,8/18/2017,This is one of the best places in town and only is the food good service is good the waiters and waitresses are good and of course the cheesecake can't beat it go there all the time for birthdays anniversaries it's really good worth every penny I just wish they would take reservations
Rosie Z.,"Reno, NV",0,3,,3.0,8/31/2017,"Very disappointed with the service, not busy but noticed customer who came in after us had their water n bread and we were still waiting.  I had to complain to a nice server by the name of Daniel who wasn't in our area but he was very helpful and attempted to get our server, she again was horrible she came and told us our bread would be out but then gave it to customers who came in after us!!!  Last time I eat at this Cheesecake Factory!!"
Adrianna G.,"Reno, NV",32,23,7,3.0,11/20/2017,"After spending 10 minutes looking over the menu, I finally decided on Shrimp Scampi and Steak Diane it was on the menu as a combination. When the server came to take our orders, I was famished! My mouth was literally watering when she asked me how I would like my steak cooked. A few minutes later she returned to our table specifically to kill my vibe. She said they didn't have the steak Diane this evening. With my heart set on steak.. I asked if they could upgrade my steak, she said she had to ask the manager. So then here comes the manager talking about they got the wrong order and the steak Diane never came in, then she says she can sell me the $29 fillet and add on a side of shrimp for $5.... my combination went from $22 to $34! Umm no! She apologized and said I'll give you some time to look over the menu... there I am staring aimlessly at the menu trying to tell myself i didn't really want steak anyways and that I'll find something better on the menu. Have you ever had to switch from steak mode? It's nearly impossible! I didn't want to ruin dinner for my son and my husband so i just closed my eyes and pointed to something, because let's face it, nothing is going to top steak. So... I ended up ordering shrimp pasta. The whole time I was eating it I was crying inside. (It's wasn't that good) Why if they knew that the steaks never came in would they let it get that far? I was fully committed! I'll never forgive you Cheesecake Factory!"
Michelle F.,"Reno, NV",30,123,356,5.0,3/8/2017,"Really love dining here as I do feel that even a lunch here is dining. I take care to order with caution only as I know they give you a lot of great food for the price. This last visit I ordered from their lunch specials on the menu as that portion is smaller but definitely ample. My hubby had the lunch special meatloaf. Came with many slices, sumptuous mushroom gravy, mashed potatoes that they had actually made,and a side of veggies.  I ordered the regular Shrimp Louie...I asked how big the shrimp were as know sometimes you can receive itty bitty barely there shrimp! She replied, they are prawns! I ordered! We enjoyed decaf coffee and could not help but notice, during our meal, if anything was lacking, as in a coffee refill or the bread basket, we did not have to hunt down our waitress, someone walking by immediately refilled for us. I did commend our waitress on this experience and she said they are trained that ALL the tables are their tables. Food was excellent, surroundings delightful, service outstanding. We will be back!"
Bill S.,"Reno, NV",53,105,248,3.0,8/7/2016,"After a couple not so good visits, I decided, well my wife decided to drag me here because she loves the Chinese chicken salad. I got my usual lunch fish n chips. The lunch portion is big enough to fill you, but not make you feel overly stuffed. For some reason the fish was a little dry on this visit.  The only reason I'm taking my time to make this review is solely on the incredible customer service that we received from our server; Karly. She has a great personality, very upbeat and attentive. She was the shining star for this visit, something I've been waiting to receive from this establishment on my previous visits.  Maybe one of these days I'll have the food match the customer service that Karly can dish out, so I can give more than 3 stars.  5 for Karly today."
Esther O.,"Reno, NV",0,3,,2.0,8/19/2017,They are over priced! Their food is not worth that price. I'd rather go to BJ's. I tried their avacodo egg rolls and they were far from what I expected. This was my first and most likely only time I will eat there.
Kay C.,"Northwest Reno, Reno, NV",121,7,,1.0,3/21/2017,"My husband, I and our toddler visited this location last night for dinner.  No crayons or activities for the kiddos - which has been my first experience ANYWHERE, so keeping a 3 year old busy throughout the dinner was a challenge in and of itself.  We ordered the crab artichoke appetizer and it was delicious, although very greasy. Then a chicken sandwich for myself, hubby got a smokehouse burger and the kid had the corn dogs and fruit. My sandwich was just plain gross and I'm not really sure how you mess up bread, fried chicken and hot sauce -- but they did. It was tasteless, soggy within moments and unpleasant. The smokehouse burger was decent, although a side of avocado was 3 dollars. And the corn dogs seemed like they were great, but the side of fruit was OLD and SOGGY and literally looked like it sat in a bowl for a week we commented on it and the waitress offered us fries instead, which we declined (kind of defeats the purpose of giving your kid something nutritional with his deep fried hot dogs). For dessert we ordered the White Chocolate Rasp Cheesecake and a Lemoncello Cake -- Both were FANTASTIC.  Overall though, the food was terrible especially for how pricey this establishment is. 80% of the time we were looking for our waitress for sauce or refills or to order something - even desert took 15 minutes to get out to us. In addition, my husband ended up getting sick and was up all night in the bathroom, which we should have expected from how poorly our food tasted.  We won't visit this restaurant again there are far better and more affordable places to go in the area."
Perfecto M.,"Reno, NV",868,264,626,5.0,12/17/2015,"Love come by to the Cheesecake Factory. I usually get the Kobe beef burger and usually never disappoints. We came in a big group the last time we were here and it was great. The staff is awesome and friendly. We came on a Wednesday night and it was busy. Man was I glad we got our table reserved.  Also when we were waiting to be seated, we got there a bit early, I noticed the cheesecakes in the display case and man did they look good. I also noticed that people were just lining up to just get cheesecake. I was surprised and never really had their cheesecake there. So I decided to try their cheesecake after dinner. I will talk about that after I talk about the Kobe beef burger with mushrooms. It was good! I would definitely recommend that burger. Now if you don't like mushrooms that's fine because I don't like them either but there I was eating mushrooms. Well, I don't dislike mushrooms but I think the mushrooms add a good flavor to the burger. The fries are good too.  Now let's get back to the cheesecake. We had the Chocolate Tuxedo Cheesecake and man it went down very easy. Between my wife and I we ate it very quickly. I almost want to get another or try another cheesecake. It was very good. I now realized why people were lining up just for the cheesecake, it was good! I yearn for this cheesecake sometimes. It's embarrassing I know but I do. I also yearn for the Kobe Burger too. I love it hehe. Thanks for reading my review."
Jackie C.,"Reno, NV",0,10,4,5.0,7/12/2017,"I'm so happy to report how delicious my lunch was 6/11/17.  I had the tropical iced tea with the Chicken Reisling (chicken sautéed in a sweet reisling cream wine sauce with bacon and sweet onion pieces) with a side of thinly tossed angel hair pasta with herb olive oil.  I ate slowly to savor every bite.  I was going to go in for the key lime cheesecake, but I was too full and running errands after lunch and it was too hot in the car to take a piece to go.  I am impressed at their sugarless desserts for those watching their sugar intake.  I will be back!"
Mary S.,"Reno, NV",46,57,11,4.0,1/9/2017,"What we ordered: Steak Diane, Fetuccini Alfredo, Chicken Fetuccini Alfredo,  kids chicken tenders, and a slice of Lemon Raspberry Cheesecake.   Cost: $70+. Gasp Quite honestly, I had a bit of sticker shock. I ordered this all for pickup. The online menu didn't have prices, and the nice gal on the phone didn't tell me how much my order was.  But, I had a couple of gift cards, so I wasn't too concerned. Worth $70?? Nah. But on a cold rainy day, I didn't want to cook.   The Steak Diane was cooked perfectly cooked Medium as requested. The pasta.. was just pasta. The winner was obviously the cheesecake. Very rich, and creamy.  My order was also ready within the 20 minutes. I didn't have to wait, even after seeing they were extremely busy. And, amongst the chaos, everyone was professional,  and kind!"
Charlie B.,"Denver, CO",37,9,8,3.0,7/23/2017,"food is good enough. If you've eaten at one Cheesecake factory you've eaten at them all. The best part of this place is you can almost always split a pasta entree with another and still walk away without being hungry, which makes the high price for their plates almost worth it."
Clare P.,"Sparks, NV",0,18,,5.0,10/13/2017,"Always at the top notch service, quality of food is excellent. Red velvet cheesecake is to die for."
Donna B.,"Reno, NV",432,955,5357,3.0,8/14/2015,"I don't know 3-4 stars ?  I don't frequent chain restaurants all that much. And this occasion was because a coworker had given me $50 in gift cards. I really only truly like the Godiva dark chocolate cheesecake, but 5-6 slices of it seemed a little much. So we had a light bite after golf.  After7 pm seems like a better time, just at the tail end of the rush. We waited only 5 minutes for a table. Service was prompt. Food took just a bit longer than expected, probably because we were so hungry. Then menu, as everyone knows is abut lengthy. Hubby tried the chicken Alfredo, which was enough for two meals at $16. It was a bit garlicky. I tried a couple of small plates for $7 each- stuffed tater tots and crab balls. Both ok but just nothing wow about them, lacked seasoning.  The restaurant seemed very clean. The patio in the afternoon sun would be quite warm.  The slices of Godiva cake I took home did not disappoint. But as soon as I figure out that recipe I have no need to return b"
Klanci M.,"Minden, NV",1,11,12,2.0,12/28/2016,"Stopped by to have lunch with my daughter today. The food was good, nothing special. However, the service was lousy. I had a server that only introduced herself and provided me a check. Made snide comments when asked about the flavors of cheesecake available. Then to make it better, we had two additional people actually deliver our food. We waited long periods of time without attention and we felt stuffed away into a corner. Unfortunately do to these factors we will not be returning to the Cheesecake factory in Reno."
Joe R.,"Reno, NV",25,102,287,4.0,10/11/2015,"The menu is extensive, surely something for everyone! The portions are extremely oversized so plan on sharing or taking home for another meal. Trying the family style approach to dining is a good idea here. Also know the restaurant will kindly split you slice of cheesecake in half to share and the half sized portion is very doable after such a hearty meal! Consistently is king at CF and in our experience have never been disappointed with quality and flavor of food and the quality and speed of service and this visit was no different. If you haven't taken the time yet or even know that there is a CF in Reno, do stop in and give it a whirl. Hey Reno visitors, there are really good alternative dining spots in our city away from the casinos and this is definitely one of them!"
L V.,"Sparks, NV",76,16,9,1.0,12/20/2016,"We've eaten at this location 6-7 times with both small groups and large groups. The service has been ok to great and the food usually good to excellent.  When we've had any type of issue the manager has been quick to comp a meal.  A few days ago friends were needing to finish up some shopping at the Mall and we planned to meet for lunch.  Neither had been to the Cheesecake Factory. I thought perfect, something for everybody and right in the Mall. This is the first time I've come here with small children; infant and 4 year old, both very well behaved. We're told there will be 20 minute wait until we're able to be seated.  I stated there are 3 adults and two children. The hostess says ""5 then"". We think, OK not too bad, lets make a bathroom run, check out the menu, shouldn't be too difficult even when having to stand in the middle of everything with two small children.  35 minutes later we were seated. At a booth without a highchair, we have to stop somebody and ask for a high chair. We wait some more they finally bring a high chair.  Within a reasonable amount of time we're given drinks and our order is taken...We order three interesting appetizers to share and a childrens grilled cheese. 45 minutes later the first human interaction from any staff is the manager who peaks around the corner of our booth apologizing for the delay in getting our order. The order arrives while he's making some sort of explanation and we're finally asked if our drinks need refilling.  There is no grilled cheese for the kids. 10 minutes later a dried out, sandwich with not melted cheese shows up. The Spring Roll and the Avocado Egg Rolls were excellent. The Artichoke Crab Dip was disgusting. It was fishing, oily, and slightly burnt. I had fully expected to have at least one item credited off the bill.  The bill showed up with everything included to the tune of $65.00 I briefly looked for the manager  again, but he was nowhere to be found and we were more than ready to be gone. Needless to say my friends won't be coming back after this experience. I will not be recommending it to anybody with children, and might not be in any hurry to go back myself. Disappointing....."
Schon O.,"Sparks, NV",14,63,62,2.0,3/27/2017,"The service always seems to be horrible. When I say always, we have tried to like this location 4 or 5 times. The food is over priced, the drinks are very expensive. I don't understand why it is always crowded??? Salt seems to be the main ingredient in every dish we tried. Just not worth the wait and price when there are so many great options near by."
Elizabeth P.,"Sparks, NV",1,45,10,3.0,5/8/2017,"Went on a busy Saturday night . ( may 6 th ) place was packed . We put our name on the list and was told if a space came up in the bar ( black tables ) we could just sit down .  Someone moved out of the barstools after about 10 minutes and we sat down .  Food is pretty much always good here . Bartenders are right in front of us and are busy . After about 8 to 10 minutes ( husband was about to leave ) the female bartender finally A knowledge Us and said she would be with us soon . Now , yes I get it , super busy , but we are in front of you . Say something to us . Anything let me know we aren't invisible.  We got our drinks , very good , ordered our food .  Food came in reasonable amount of time . I ordered the steak Diane.  My mash potatoes were cold . Not warm , cold . My steak was warm , not hot . It was tender but not well seasoned . I was disappointed . Not wanting to mess up my date night with my husband I didn't say anything . My husband had the Shepards pie and he raved about how good it was I was really glad that his came out so well .  The bartender suggested cheesecake for dessert.  I'm not sure how anybody ever eats dessert over at cheesecake factory, because they're so full from the meal . But we did decide to take some to go.  We got our check and we waited for a cheesecake, and we waited more for cheesecake, and then we continue to wait for our cheesecake.  Adding additional time Frame of 15 more minutes while we waited for cheesecake that we had ordered to go.  We finally did get a cheesecake, at that point the female bartender, look and I said oh my gosh you've been waiting so long. If I had known you'd been waiting so long I would have went and got it myself.  I hope they step up on a busy Saturday night and make sure food is warm and people don't have to wait"
Lissa C.,"Reno, NV",48,6,1,5.0,3/24/2017,"Went here last night for a friend's birthday celebration--I had the GF Godiva chocolate cheesecake and my husband had the crab cake app, both were really delicious. What really made our night, though, was our server, Danielle M.  When she checked my friend's ID and didn't say anything about it being her birthday, I was really surprised (as a server myself I know how easy but important that can be). However, she HAD noticed, and instead of saying anything she brought out her cheesecake all decked out with a candle and pretty ""Happy birthday"" writing. The staff came over to sing and we were all wondering who had asked for that. Then, I realized it was just Danielle killing it at her job. Thought that was really cool. On top of that, my hubs and I both have pretty specific drink orders, she was patient with us and both drinks came out perfect. We were all super happy with this visit!"
