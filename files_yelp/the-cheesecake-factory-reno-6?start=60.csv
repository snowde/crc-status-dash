Kevin J.,"Berkeley, CA",391,110,57,5.0,2/18/2016,"This was my first visit to a Cheesecake Factory so I didn't know what to expect, besides the crazy wait. The crazy wait aside (which you should know about when going to any sit-down mall restaurant anyway), this Cheesecake Factory is a good ride!  The menu is very diverse, with lots of meat and pasta classics, but also some more interesting modern fusion offerings like an ahi carpaccio (thin sliced raw ahi tuna with sauce). I personally had a steak diane+herb salmon combo for $21, and both were made very well. The salmon was seasoned nicely with a good sear on the outside while still remaining moist on the inside, and the steak diane was cooked to a beautiful medium rare.  And of course, you can't forget the cheesecake. Lots of tasty-looking offerings, some of them worse for you than others. I shared the Oreo cheesecake with my sister and we had a hard time polishing it off. That thing is intense. Tasty but intense.  Service was great, especially considering it was Saturday of Valentine's/President's Day weekend, so it was pretty busy. Irene was warm, friendly, and knowledgeable while juggling multiple tables and still remaining timely and attentive towards our needs (more bread, water refills, checking in on us after our entrees arrived, patiently giving us her recommendations on cheesecake choices, etc.) Truly a rockstar!  I had a solid first visit to Cheesecake Factory thanks to these folks last weekend and am definitely down to visit again."
Zack K.,"Fallon, NV",85,4,11,5.0,7/15/2017,"By far, greater service than expected. Especially considering how pact and busy it was. Beautiful environment, but not too uptight to where I would feel obligated to grab my best suit. A little more on the luxurious side of pricing, but aside from the gourment cheescake, you're also paying for the family friendly quick service."
Kym D.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,56,17,3.0,6/26/2017,"Came here with a friend for cheesecake. It was pretty good. The cheesecake portion was great; I ended up getting a to go box for what I couldn't finish. My cheesecake was too sweet for my taste, but overall had great flavor. Customer service is also great here."
Carina P.,"Castro Valley, CA",6,145,472,5.0,11/11/2016,"Who would write a bad review for cheesecake? The food and duh... The cheese cake are to die for. The staff is all very helpful, and attentive so we're always in and out at a reasonable time. The portions are huge so if it's early, ask for a lunch portion!"
Frank B.,"Reno, NV",2,15,4,5.0,7/11/2017,Pies have gotten better and we are buying again!  Much quicker service and staff friendliness.
Jennie Z.,"Sparks, NV",96,58,9,3.0,2/1/2017,"About half way through my visit - I had already determined that this was going to be a 1-2 star review. I brought my family here - a visit that had been built up and postponed for a better time for over a week. We were SO excited. The visit had a terrible start... 2/3 of our knives were dirty with actual dried food (not just water marks)... it took over 10 minutes for them to even take our beverage order - and then brought the adult soft drinks out, saying my daughter's drink would be there shortly - it was another 5-7 minutes at least. They were clearly training multiple employees this day, which is fine, but they were so busy and people were tripping over each other and the duplicate waiter/waitresses was very crowded and made the already busy establishment even busier. It was very overwhelming. Now comes our food.... My chicken salad sandwich was - eh... super greasy bread, I decided to try to eat just the chicken salad and ditch the bread... HOLY SALTY AWFULNESS. The side salad with the house vinaigrette was pretty tasty. But i wouldn't suggest their cream of chicken soup - it tasted like they took Campbells canned soup and through artichoke hearts in it. My daughter LOVES their orange chicken- which i tasted and was pretty good. We also ordered the pancake breakfast with eggs and bacon. You should be warned that their standard syrup is a BUTTER Syrup - which after we complained about the weird taste - they identified that the warmer hadn't been property turned on - causing us to get a not-warm-not-mixed combination of butter and syrup... YOU CAN REQUEST REAL MAPLE SYRUP WITHOUT BUTTER which i highly suggest. When we brought the awful syrup to their attention - their responsiveness to our complaint was the reason that they got bumped up to a 3 star review. They apologized, corrected the situation promptly, explained what caused it, made us a brand new plate of food to-go. The manager even came by to apologize after our initial waiter was able to resolve the issue without any hesitation. The crappy experience turned into a good one - for the most part. Overall - the food is overpriced and not the best.... the cheese cake is truly the only reason to go there. Eat food somewhere else - and dine in for cheese cake - or even just get the cheesecake to-go. I've never had bad cheesecake there - all of the flavors are delightful! Tiramisu is my fave!"
Cheryl B.,"Reno, NV",50,170,243,5.0,4/4/2015,"A great place for a family or group dinner.  A little loud but that's because it's always busy - for good reason!  Something for everyone. In fact, a very extensive menu so everyone should be able to find more than several things that appeal. Really good size portions and well paced service.  Be sure to save room for cheesecake - it really is the reason to go. We split the Chris Outrageous and Fresh Banana and a little bite of each together was AMAZING! Everyone was very friendly and Tanya G was an excellent server."
Rachel S.,"Reno, NV",79,124,68,4.0,8/15/2016,"I'm updating my review because I have been back a couple times since (when my mom is in town, it's her favorite lunch place) and have never had as awful an experience as I did at the time of my last review.  The food is solid. I like the variety. The cheesecake is what dreams are made of. They make some interesting and delicious cocktails. And the service the past two or three times has been spot on, so I guess Cheesecake Factory and I are friends again."
Devon T.,"Reno, NV",89,95,165,4.0,3/30/2015,"The Lady and I both have a huge sweet tooth, so when the chance to get at some awesome cheesecake came up, we jumped at it. The food is OK, probably just a three star, but the cheesecake is AMAZING!. Which is good, because it would suck to eat at a place called the cheesecake factory and find it had crappy cheesecake.  The happy hour specials here (at the bar area) are great and the portions are ridiculously huge. You definitely get a lot for what you pay for here. I would definitely recommend trying this place out, but come hungry and expect to leave with leftovers for the next couple of days."
Angela F.,"Reno, NV",271,327,1787,3.0,12/30/2015,"This is one of those lots of food restaurants.  It's okay, not gourmet, good desserts.  Came because it was right next to Visionworks and I just ordered new glasses.  It's in the Mall, but fortunately has a separate ""street"" entrance.  Food is hearty, I enjoyed my Cuban sandwich.  However the Falafel Salad was really really dry, even with extra ""dressing.""  Actually I don't like falafel, but my daughter wouldn't eat them.  Said it tasted like it was made with potatoes, and not chick peas as it's supposed to be made.  But on the whole a pretty decent place to eat.  Service was good.  Place is loud.  It is what it is.  Basically an okay place for a quick meal."
Paul S.,"Reno, NV",1125,965,5321,3.0,11/13/2014,"November 13, 2014 Thursday - 6:45 PM Dinner  3 adults  Atmosphere - 4 stars Food -4 stars Service - 2 stars Background - We were at the mall, thus we are here.   Atmosphere - Smallest Cheesecake Factory I have ever seen.  The tables are way too close to each other.  The place is load but I could hear group that was sitting two tables over. Food   Drink - Guinness brought out with a glass with an ounce of water in it.  I do not know where that water came from.  Do you not try your glassware?   My Meal     Appetizer - Avocado spring rolls.  Solid, I was not of the fan of the dipping sauce but the ladies at the table did.        Main Course - Seared Tuna Tataki Salad.  I attached in three sections as it was presented that way.  Cold Tuna slices perfectly seared, nice mixed green salad, and three beef steak tomatoes.  Each by themselves were solid but together made a great meal. Service - Slow!  Thursday night there was a 20 minute wait for a group of three us, no biggie.  But don't text me to tell me you are ready and make me wait more by standing next to the hostess stand for you to find the spot and grab menus.  While reading the menu another server dropped something and hit my chair, not a word saying sorry.  They were dropping things left and right.  The another waiter dropped stuff at the table to my left later in the night.  Slow again, how does a table the gets their appetizer after us get their dinner before us.  We ordered ""fancy"" salads.  Every item on my plate was cold.  They had a burger that I could see.  At one point, I assume was the manager, we were told that the food will be out soon.  Slow or did they just forget about us and went to fix it mode. Future - maybe."
Kalee B.,"Reno, NV",57,79,7,3.0,2/22/2017,"2nd go round for this place. The servers no longer wear all whiet. Thank goodness! The service was a little awkward and fell flat. I had the Chicken Madeira. It was very underwhelming, lacked flavor and was just blah. Their prices are a bit much to me still."
Stephanie G.,"Reno, NV",269,204,1498,5.0,2/12/2015,"In celebration of my Fiances birthday, we decided to go out to dinner once again to, The Cheesecake Factory. We sat on the heated porch and service was admittedly a little slow, but we weren't in any rush. Our waitress came and she was very sweet, bringing us our drinks quickly after arriving to the table...can I just say their Arnold Palmer is really great!  The menu has so many great things, it took me forever to decide, the little longer wait really wasn't a problem for us. My hunny decided on the Spicy Crispy Chicken Sandwich, and I feeling the hunger of not eating lunch that day, ordered with my eyes instead of my mind when I asked for the Macaroni and Cheese, Cheese Burger with sweet potato fries... I thought one bite and boom...heart attack, but my eyes couldn't get past the visual I was seeing in my mind, and the burger wasn't disappointing...  A medium burger for me which means pink, with a fried macaroni ball, topped with cheddar cheese sauce. After my first bite, it wasn't the heart attack that got me, it was the fact that I had died and gone to heaven from happiness! I don't know if it was the hunger of the day catching up to me, the absolute, sinfully delicious burger, or a combination of the both, but I am going to go ahead and say, BEST burger I've had in a long time. We were too full for Cheesecake however decided that after our first to visits being so delicious, we want to make it a point to come back and keep trying different items, and maybe even come one night to have cheesecake, for dinner!"
Angelo A.,"Sparks, NV",280,8,8,4.0,2/26/2017,Bang bang chicken and shrimp was delectable  over brown rice could have had a little more sauce but definitely enjoyable. Believe it or not 1st time here heh! Pineapple mojito was kinda weak but acceptable.
Rylie W.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,3,,2.0,9/12/2017,"I was not satisfied with my visit to the cheesecake factory. I am a poor college student and I wanted to spend the last of my money on a delicious meal but it was definitely not delicious. It started off with the bread being really cold and hard. Next I ordered a hamburger with non-grilled onions. When they brought the burger to me (I will have you know I was also the last to receive my meal) there were grilled onions it!! Once they take it back, about five minutes later they come out to inform me that they have dropped my hamburger and have to make a new one---Keep in mind my friends are already done with their meals by this time. By the time they bring out my new meal I just asked them to put it in a to-go box. The only thing that saved this meal is the fact that I got it for free."
Katie P.,"Reno, NV",166,81,90,3.0,5/30/2016,"I'm going to preface this review with saying their cheesecake is bomb. I mean, if you're ever in need of a really fantastic way to bow out of your diet in a truly epic way, get one of their ridiculous slices of signature I-just-gained-30-pounds-in-my-ass-like-literally-as-I-was-eating-cheesecake. I suggest taking it to go and eating it alone, as you watch Friends on Netflix, in your dirty sweats, while crying. It tastes better that way.  Now, onto their food. It's good. Really. Every time I've gone, it's been seriously lip-smackingly-tasty. The problem I have is the amount of choices on their book of a menu. It's like way beyond overwhelming. It's one thing to have a lot of variety in one realm of food options, like many different choices of Italian fare. At least that way it narrows your decision making down a tad. On The Cheesecake Factory menu you can travel, by way of your palate, to Asia, Mexico, Italy, the South, Texas, and many more, I'd bet. Too.many.options. How can any single person decide between chicken piccata and chicken and biscuits? How? Tell me how!  OK, now that I've discussed their cheesecake and food options, I must mention their service. It could be improved upon. This excludes the cheesecake desk where you can walk up, order your demise, and slip out, without too many noticing you really don't need cheesecake. Every person I've come into contact there has been uber friendly. The area they need to improve upon is their waitstaff. This last time I went and ate in the restaurant with a friend. I wouldn't say it was incredibly busy, but the wait for everything was so long. Fat-kid-waiting-for-his cake-long. Now, if the servers are really working up a sweat, and I can tell they are working their tails off, I don't mind a wait. No. Our server didn't seem to mind making us wait 20 minutes for our Coke Zero.  All in all, The Cheesecake Factory will always make a killing with their cheesecake alone. I'll just have to get a slice to go instead of sitting down and spending more money on a full meal. Such is life."
Candie L.,"Reno, NV",1,28,17,4.0,4/15/2017,"Great atmosphere and good for a family. The kids loved the nacho appetizer and the pizza. The cheesecake was amazing, but the chicken I got was okay. Would go back for the cheesecake, but maybe I'll try something else on the huge menu."
Mark J.,"Reno, NV",895,432,241,1.0,1/16/2017,"So I eat at the Cheesecake Factory on December 30, 2014, gave it a four star review,we had a wonderful experience, now two years later thing have changed.  We have just moved back to Reno and I was planning on meeting my wife at the Cheesecake Factory, because we enjoyed it the last time we lived here.  So my wife got there about 15-20 minutes ahead of me and asked for a table and she wait for about 15 minutes and they seated her a little high top table in the bar area.  Now to get a clear picture of the restaurant, there were several vacant tables throughout the dinning room.  So they sat her in the bar at a high top and she sat there for about 13 minutes until I go there, yes I was running late.  The whole time she sat at the table not one person stopped and ask her for a drink order or check on her.  ZERO customer service and when I did show up all she wanted to do is leave and so we left.  As we were leaving the young host at the front counter told to have a nice evening and when I told her we didn't get any one to wait on us and she smiled and she said ""have a nice night good bye"".   She did make any attempt to fine out why were leaving or how she could help us.  Just a smart allick remark.  So we left and to Texas Roadhouse and spent our $65 at that restaurant. Shame on these big chain restaurants that hire young inexperienced help, then promotes them to position of leadership with little if not zero training.  I know if I was in the service industry and my income relied on customer service and return customers, I would have my people trained on how make our customers have the optimal dinning experience.   NOT HERE I know realistically people will drop the ball, if you read my last review back in December of 2014, you will see that the staff drop the ball there too, just the food was really good.  This time we didn't get any food, because we NEVER got waited on.......  Drive by the mail there are better places to eat in town, with better customer service!    I would recommend other eateries while visiting the Biggest Little City in the World!"
KC B.,"Reno, NV",32,51,7,4.0,8/17/2016,"I have kinda stayed away from this restaurant because it always seems crowded and the menu is overly ambitious, however we had a great experience yesterday. We arrived before five and there were only 8-10 tables in use. Our server Lindsay V. was fantastic- we never lacked for anything, her timing was perfect, and her smile infectious. I ordered the lunch-sized Shepherd's Pie (you can still order off the lunch menu fairly late) and my wife had the three-cheese pasta (regular size). My dish was steaming hot and full of flavor. I loved the mushrooms and julienned zucchini- better than the standard frozen peas and carrots at other places. My wife enjoyed her pasta, and had enough to take some home for lunch the next day. My lunch portion was perfect. No leftovers :) We then split a slice of Reese's Cheesecake. Wow! Decadent! I loved the variety of textures and layers- no bite was exactly the same. Just what you want when splitting a slice.  Overall the only thing that made it not worth 5 Stars was the price: $50 without tip. We had an iced tea and a diet soda so we didn't splurge other than the cheesecake. Still a great experience and perfect service. We will return..."
Robert S.,"Reno, NV",848,894,3127,3.0,8/23/2014,"I can has Cheesecake? Sure!  I can has it at the Cheesecake Factory!  We wanted to try out this new to Reno place and so we planned our night accordingly.   Prepare for an hour long wait?  Check. Prepare for rewarmed chain food? Check. Prepare for overworked and harried staff? Check. So did our preparations actually help us?  Not much. We walked in on a Sunday night to put our name in.  ""30 minutes"" she said.  ""Cool"" we said.  ""What's your phone number?"" She said.  ""775-999-4444"" I said.  ""Name?"" she said.  ""Kiwi"" I said. We walked over to Lenscrafters to kill some time and about 10 minutes later we got ""the text"".  We were whisked away to a nice little table just off the kitchen in the bar area.  Then the Death Star opened fire on my wife.  The rest of this review is in memoriam of my beautiful wife as she was melted by the death star door that goes to the patio.  The sun may have been a beautiful setting elsewhere...but from inside, it was lasers of pain.  We moved positions and tried to make the best of it.  So if you can see the patio door near sunset time during this time of the year.....beware and avert your eyes.   My wife ordered up a scampi and steak special.  You can read Ly's review when it get's posted for her take.  I ordered up a burger and it was nice.  But it was a little awkward on the roll it came on, so my meat slipped right outta the bun..... .....ahem..... ...anyway, it was a tasty chain level burger that was cooked properly to order and I chose the salad to come with it.  The salad wasn't my favorite but my pickier wife was happy to help me with it.  Go figure. Then came the dessert!!  Ooooh la la!!  It was my wife's birthday weekend so she picked the Reeses Cheesecake.  I took one bite and spit it out.  My wife and daughter almost finished the single piece.  But even one bite was too much for me.  Sugar death incarnate.  The service on this evening was not so harried as just not really organized.  Most of the staff wasn't running around all stressed but they weren't hitting any spots that they should have hit.   So in closing, our preparations were helpful in some ways and other ways we were over prepared.  Next time we go in, I am sure the experience will be different.  That happens when you have a chain restaurant experience.  Because staff never can stay. One warning...most people who are into food have come to understand ""Factory"" as a bad descriptor.  You might want to turn that little warning light off when you go in....because they use the name ""Factory"" on everything."
