Ernie C.,"Portland, OR",268,414,431,3.0,8/30/2014,"Stopped in on a Sunday night.  Decor is standard Cheesecake Factory - big, a little bit opulent and over the top.  A considerable build out from when it was 775 Gastropub, especially with the large patio. We checked in at the host stand, where they told us it'd be about a half hour wait, and asked for our phone number to text us.  They print off a little receipt/ticket deal, that has the estimated time that says to be in the area.  I wonder what they'd do if you didn't have a cell phone or text messaging? So, we wandered aimlessly around the mall for a bit, killing some time, and wandered back.  The receipt had said 6:30, we got the text around 6:43, so a little bit off but no big deal. I hadn't been to a Cheesecake Factory in 10 years or so (back in Chicago), and the GF had never been.  GF was a little overwhelmed by the menu, which is quite the tome.  I ended up ordered the Steak Diane and Chicken Madeira combo for $20 while she got the Pear and Blue Cheese flat bread for $7.  I remember thinking the prices seemed high when I went 10 years ago, but these prices seemed pretty reasonable to me.  Not sure if it's their price point that's changed, my disposable income, or maybe some combination of the two. The steak and chicken were actually surprisingly decent.  I ordered the steak medium rare, and the chunks of beef were cooked appropriately, while the chicken breast was cooked correctly and very tender.  The miss here would be that while the proteins were well prepared, the mushrooms that topped both were lukewarm at best.  Both were covered in overwhelming sauces with decent flavor, but definitely designed to cover up any inconsistencies and definite salt bombs.  I think the entree was fair for the price. We got the 30th anniversary cheesecake to go ($8).  I'm not a big dessert person, but it seemed decent to me, albeit a bit airy.  The GF mentioned she didn't like the texture either, and prefers the cheesecake at Manhattan Deli (a much denser affair). Our server Allyson was attentive, competent, and prompt - while the service didn't stand out, it speaks well for her and their training considering the newness of the restaurant. Overall, a solid chain dining experience.  If friends were saying to pick a chain restaurant to eat at, I think I'd lean towards Cheesecake Factory, as long as we had the time to wait."
Michelle S.,"Reno, NV",249,294,194,4.0,8/24/2014,"Before shopping with a friend we decided to stop in to the Cheesecake Factory for lunch.  It was about 1:00 in the afternoon and there was a 25 minute wait, so I didn't think that was too bad for a weekend.  Our waitress was very nice and the service was good overall.  We both ordered a sandwich from the Skinnylicious Menu and then traded halves.  We tried the Chicken Salad and the Turkey and Avocado sandwiches, both came with a side salad with balsamic vinaigrette.  Our meal arrived rather quickly.  Both sandwiches were very good.  The turkey sandwich had a lot of thinly sliced turkey.  The chicken salad had almonds and celery so it had a nice crunch factor and was quite tasty.  Of the two sandwiches the chicken salad was my favorite.  I would definitely order it again.   Now, you are at the Cheesecake Factory so of course occasionally one must partake in some cheesecake.  We settle on sharing a slice of the Ultimate Red Velvet cake Cheesecake.  OMG!!  The slice was huge!!  Lets just say that between the two of us we could not finish the entire piece (although we did make a very valiant effort!).  This cheesecake was out of this world scrumptious.  At was rich, creamy, sweet, and luscious absolutely everything an awesome cheesecake should be.  All I can say it thank goodness we were shopping afterwards because a walk was definitely needed."
Jantima B.,"Reno, NV",110,71,88,5.0,8/2/2016,Always great service and food when I come.  Very happy to have one in Reno.
Wes S.,"Sparks, NV",89,69,85,5.0,10/21/2015,"There hasn't been one time that I have visited the cheesecake factory and not been satisfied. The service is always quick, friendly, and willing to help I. Any way they can. I have never had to wait more than ten minutes to be seated, or been disappointed in my meal.  I always try to have something different when I frequent an establishment, especially when the menu is as huge as it is at the Cheesecake Factory. Any style of food you are craving, you can find it in the menu. Mexican, Chinese, and American cuisine are all available and exceptionally prepared.  The atmosphere is a little noisy but only because the patronage is in high spirits due to the fantastic circumstances wherein they find themselves. The Cheesecake Factory brings out the happy."
Taylor R.,"Reno, NV",468,204,232,4.0,9/30/2015,"I've always really loved the Cheesecake Factory, each location I've ever been to! This location included! The staff here is really nice, and always incredible pleasant! This last trip here my mom and I both ordered mojitos (her a regular one, and me a blueberry one) and they were phenomenal. Only I problem was they took a little long to make! That's fine though, I was amongst good company. I ordered the lemon-garlic shrimp which is just phenomenal, truly tastes so good! My mom ordered the grilled steak medallions and she really enjoyed it as well. My only complaint ever about the Cheesecake Factory is the fact that everything takes awhile to come out! But no biggie, I don't mind waiting for great food!"
Darla D.,"San Dimas, CA",166,885,685,4.0,11/27/2016,I liked this location. Comfy booths and same good food as other locations. We had good service and again food was good. It was quite busy but we still didn't wait to long to be seated or to get our food. We did wait a little longer than usual but no big deal in general ...
Dave H.,"Truckee, CA",555,276,1327,4.0,12/6/2015,"The Cheesecake Factory in Reno is a bit small but has all your favorite dishes.  Service is good as well.  We sat on the patio, heated nicely.  Meeks you feel your inside.  The skinnylicious menu is nicely done but only complaint, it does not mention the calories ?  I'm not sure how the skinnylicious cease Salas I'd any different than the regular cesar, but who cares, it tasted great.  Be sure to call ahead,.  With this place being this small, it fills up quickky.  Yummy"
Alice H.,"Prescott, AZ",5,2,,1.0,2/6/2017,Planned family birthday dinner at restaurant    Reservations make it easier to accommodate family members with limited mobility. Site states that reservations are accepted when in fact they aren't. Very disappointed. Looks like they will loose future customers from our family.
Blake N.,"Reno, NV",40,89,40,4.0,5/23/2016,"It's kinda small for a Cheesecake Factory. But it's got everything you'd expect packed inside. The interior is decorated, as expected. And they did a good job at it. The menu is huge and has a large variety of entrées. The food is average with a few really good items here and there. The service is great. I dined with four 12-15 year olds that did their best to behave like humans , but were unsuccessful 30% of the time. Despite that the staff were great and provided great service. I have always been unimpressed with Cheesecake Factory food. That being said they do have good cheesecake and always have great staff to take care of you. That's why I go back."
Gerald B.,"Sparks, NV",0,2,,2.0,7/23/2017,"The food is always good but the service needs improvement.  For the second straight visit a member of my family's meal has been seriously delayed.  On the first occasion the kitchen completely overlooked cooking a meal.  This meal arrived twenty minutes after the others.  On our most recent visit the food runner delivered the fist two meals without even a mention of the missing meal or its ETA.  She actually took off so fast that that she failed to notice that our drinks were empty or to ask if we required anything else (like a replacement for the knife that had accidentally fallen to the floor).  We sat and waited to eat our ever cooling hot meals until the third dish (which was a cold dish by design) arrived eight minutes later..  Okay,  eight minutes is not that long,  but how long would it have been if we had not been obviously looking around for our MIA server.   Yes,  a woman that I assume was some sort of manager did come over and apologize. Compensation for our now less than stellar luke warm meals was never made.  After these last two visits I honestly get the impression that this local Cheesecake Factory has developed the attitude that they are loved by everyone and for that reason they no longer have to try.  Minimal effort is acceptable.  All in all,  this has been two straight disappointing experiences.   I gave two stars because the food is actually good.  You just have to get past the bad service."
Kris C.,"Herlong, CA",9,17,32,3.0,11/29/2016,I had the bacon bacon cheese burger which was pretty good. I just didn't like how noisy the place was. It's very well decorated and looks upscale. To bad it's so loud.
Justine F.,"Reno, NV",302,125,337,3.0,8/26/2014,"We must have come on a good night because the wait was merely 20 minutes for dinner. We got right in and sat at a table inside. Our waitress said that the wait time has been 2 hrs at a time. I really wish that they would have made the restaurant bigger on the inside, which may be one of the reasons that the wait time is so long. Plus, it is a new restaurant. I have always loved The Cheesecake Factory. I think that it is one of the better chain restaurants around America. You can't beat the 20 million page menu. There are so many options! Plus, the cheesecake is always delicious. I am curious if they ship it in or bake it fresh daily? I started out with a mint green iced tea and my boyfriend had a lemonade. The presentation was wonderful. The ice tea came with a mint leaf inside the glass and the lemonade has a rim lined with sugar. They both were good. Our fresh, hot baked bread came right away.  My boyfriend ordered the Chicken Bellagio and I ordered Evelyn's Favorite Pasta dish. Both dishes were huge portions that we both took home leftovers for lunch the next day. I loved Evelyn's Favorite. It came with a bounty of fresh vegetables, such as zucchini, eggplant, and tomatoes. It even had olives and pine nuts in it. The sauce is a pesto based sauce. Afterwards, we ordered the banana creme cheesecake. It was a hit!!! SO GOOD! Beware how tasty this cheesecake is. It was like the pie in cheesecake form. The fresh whipped cream was amazing."
Lisa L.,"Reno, NV",10,40,42,2.0,5/22/2016,"Amid all the hype I went here on a special lunch date with my mom. It was our first time and probably the last. We went in after lunch rush and we're seated immediately. Our hostess was the most bubbly, energetic young man. When I told him we had never been there he got so excited and was so passionate about his job.  The server came over and seemed irritated from the start. After looking over the menu and being completely overwhelmed I had questions. I asked what the Luau salad was and she was like it's just layered with lettuce then carrots. I was like ok. What about the chicken almond salad is it just breast meat? Deep sigh and further frustration - I don't know it's just chicken like tuna salad. I found our hostess and after I explained all this he was mortified. I explained I could not alert the manager because my elderly mother was getting upset and I didn't want her to know that I was even talking to him. He tried his best to help me.  For the record the Luau salad was layered with crisp won tons, salad, carrots, pineapple, macadamia nuts, chicken, sesame seeds and a very lite, sweet dressing. Mother's sandwich didn't even gave the dressing nicely mixed it was just glopped on and she said it was very hot."
Jason B.,"Sparks, NV",9,477,1,5.0,3/23/2016,"I really had forgotten how good a chain restaurant could be.  For the most part,  if it's a chain,  I don't go there.  The cheesecake factory is different though. These always seem to be located in the bigger metropolitan areas and I was surprised Reno was considered large enough to warrant it. Anyway... The food was perfect as was the service. Portions were large and the price is fair. We had the Cuban sandwich and the fish tacos. Now,  it's not the same as you get in Miami or San Diego, but both were truly excellent for the Reno area.  Their iced tea was fresh and tasty.  Of course you can't leave without the cheesecake either. We didn't.  Enjoy..."
Jaime S.,"Tumwater, WA",3,72,24,3.0,12/30/2016,"The problem when I visit Reno, there are not many choices...the Cheesecake F is not bad, just boring and my single friends here think this its a great place, don't get me wrong, food, service and flavor was OK but, I can try OK in any other city/state!"
Fernando C.,"Sparks, NV",2,13,,2.0,6/28/2017,"I got my word across to Cheesecake. Had a wonderful lady (Dawn) call me and apologize for the rudeness and invited my back to fix things. I have yet to go back and order from them. I hope for a better experience next time. Will update again next time I go to see how things have changed, but I don't want them to remember too see if they really did make some changes."
Claudy H.,"Carson City, NV",156,394,5247,5.0,9/26/2014,"I'm a fan! Before it was open in Reno, always went to Roseville just for cheesecake but now I'm glad that they opened here.  Their food are yummy, and of course their cheesecake. My fav are the Hershey, and the strawberry cheesecake. Their service always excellent. Love it"
Jodie S.,"Reno, NV",112,120,239,5.0,6/18/2015,"Ummm ok, so I know that the Cheesecake Factory has been in Reno for some time now, but I really just have not had the opportunity to stop on in! Yesterday evening my dad treated my family to dinner and I was so excited I was going to try it out!  Upon walking in I as astounded by how absolutely gorgeous it was. The waiter was beyond friendly, really, he was such a jokester. I do appreciate good humor! I also have a soft spot for waiters that recognize that we have young children and they get the orders in for them right away! My eldest son ordered the mini corndogs with fruit and my youngest ordered pizza. Each of them thoroughly enjoyed the meal. I was surprised that the mini corndogs came with the sticks in them. It was so cute! The child's pizza was huge! So huge that my dad and brother also had a piece. Everyone thought it was delicious!   I ordered the Kale & Quinoa Salad and added some grilled chicken. It was A-MAZ-ING! There was a wonderful combination of lemon dressing, sweet red peppers, grapes, and parmesan with each and every bite. My husband had the pulled pork burger that he said was awesome! My dad ordered the herb-crusted salmon with steak Diane and garlic mashed potatoes. The salmon was so fresh and full of flavor ( I tried a bite). My brother ordered the same except chicken in place of the salmon. I was impressed with the flavor that each meal brought!  For desert we ordered a red velvet and strawberry cheesecake to share. I could not believe the size of the slices! Boy was I glad that we were sharing! The red   velvet cheesecake was layers of red velvet cake and then cheesecake with white chocolate shavings on the back. The red velvet cake was so moist and really blended well with the cheesecake. I did not try the strawberry cheesecake, but the strawberries were huge and looked fresh! My brother and father finished it all, so I figure that that says a lot! There were so many other items I would like to try and I can't wait to get to go back!"
Suzy Q.,"San Martin, CA",8,309,18,1.0,5/31/2016,Summer rolls- eww dried out rice wrapper and only a half piece of shrimp in two of the four pieces. Beef medallions- skimpy portion of everything except the grape tomatoes. The Beef was sear to smithereens & too salty to eat. Server didn't ask if I wanted bread The worst location I've eaten at and I've eaten at a lot of locations nationwide
Kim S.,"Reno, NV",41,63,52,4.0,8/7/2016,"Love the Cheesecake Factory - food is great, but this Reno location can be a whole lot cleaner.  Meaning just stuff always on the floors of the restaurant.  Bathrooms are always a mess. Paper pieces on the floor.  Seems to always be an issue with this location. With that exception, I do like sitting in Karly T.'s section.  She is an awesome server!  Very attentive, remembers what I like to order even (yay) and she's always on top of my favorite green mint tea refills!  Service is important to me, and Karly is by far my favorite at the Cheesecake Factory!  Wish I could have her great service at some of my other favorite restaurants in town.   Little disappointed to see that one of my favorite pasta dishes, chicken scampi, is off the menu.   Chinese chicken salad is my fave.  Plum dressing is delish.   Also the well mannered martini's are so good."
