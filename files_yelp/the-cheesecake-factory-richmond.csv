Maria T.,"Henrico, VA",52,215,536,4.0,12/25/2017,"Top of the food chain restaurant!  This place is so much more than cheesecake.  We got there early when they opened at 10:00am for their Saturday breakfast!  Yes, they've extended their Sunday brunch to include Saturday!  Smart move!  The brunch menu is extensive.  Great choices!  I stuck with the bacon and eggs with blueberry pancakes.  It was all good!!  My friend had the most tremendous omelette, which she raved about!  The tea selection is fabulous too!  I thought the prices were comparable to the quality and quantity of food.   We were seated in the octagon Florida room which I highly recommend.  The main dining area tables can be tight, so a booth is your best bet.  We had plenty of room, had a nice view and it was much quieter in there.  It's also decorated lovely, as is the rest of the restaurant.  The restrooms were clean and fresh. (That's a lot of ""rests"" in one paragraph.) Our server, Katty, greeted us with warmth and enthusiasm.  Super sweet but not overbearing.  A genuine smile to go with her kind personality.  I'd request her section again.   My only critique would be regarding the cutlery and glassware.  The knives were covered in dried food and the glasses were murky and dirty.  Katty quickly apologized and rectified the problem graciously.  She brought back sparkling tableware and we enjoyed the rest of our visit.  This may have simply been a fluke or an oversight in the kitchen, but that accounts for the loss of one star.  However, I will update my review if upon my next visit they clean up their act."
Sara M.,"Midlothian, VA",166,176,243,3.0,12/25/2017,I came A week before Christmas on a Monday at 11:30 AM and this place was packed. Thankfully I was able to be seated without a reservation. Service was pretty slow and our waitress didn't check on us very often but I think it's because of how busy they were. Also their menu is huge and it was hard find the lunch specials. I ended up getting the dinner portion of the Alfredo fettuccine with chicken because the lunch option did not come with chicken and it was only six dollars more for the dinner size. I have no idea why a lunch size fettuccine Alfredo with no protein cost almost $14. The noodles ended up being way overdone and there wasn't much chicken. My mom ended up getting a Caesar salad with a margarita pizza and she said it was a great Caesar salad and the pizza was pretty good too.  It then took forever to get our check and boxes and it turned out they just ran out of the big Togo boxes so we had to stuff the pizza in the smallest boxes they had.  We came here because I was given a gift card by my best friend but I don't think I'll be coming back it just wasn't worth it.
Tammy E.,"Chester, VA",2,19,48,5.0,12/23/2017,"Brunch was wonderful ... Great service from Katty! The California Omelette was cook perfectly ... It wasn't dry and cheese was warm and creamy . The avocado added a nice texture and taste to the Omelette . I always love the Cheesecake Factory .  I got there around 10:15 so there was no wait and our service was warm , quick and with a Smile !!!  It will put a dent in your wallet but you need to  splurge every now and then ."
Tanisha K.,"Henrico, VA",21,61,108,3.0,12/23/2017,"I wish Yelp had a 3 and a half star button because that's what I would give The Cheesecake Factory. I went for lunch with the hubby recently and had a nice time. We were sat very quickly, our waitress was nice and our food came out in timely manner. I was happy because they had lots of vegetarian options for me to choose from but unfortunately they were just okay tasting. My salad actually had what tasted like stale old croutons on it and for some reason I'm always shoo' ing away flies or gnats whenever I visit. I'm sure I'll end up going back there sooner or later but I'm just starting to think that The Cheesecake Factory is starting to feel like a standard chain restaurant but charging high end restaurant prices."
Edison S.,"Richmond, VA",31,1,2,1.0,12/15/2017,"This place over the years got worst,  we order the pasta napoletana, no season, its just spaghetti in plain water cook no flavors and some spicy sausage on top.  The crispy pineapple  chicken and shrimp was also bad chicken good maybe if you lucky you may see a shrimp,  I didn't got that luck.. rice was blend no flavor was heated too much got dry in the out side and wet in the inside mushi ,soft I have no idea how to express the bad taste, server was excellent, her name is Audrey"
steve k.,"Newport News, VA",37,133,,4.0,12/22/2017,"Was at this restaurant with a large group from work. We were accommodated nicely and felt like our service was very good considering the number of us. Of course, cellphones going off and folks having to leave the table non-stop during the meal takes away from the experience. However, lunch was great. My Shepherds Pie was excellent and very filling. We did have cheesecake (why not?), and while good not as good as I may have expected (once you got past the caramel topping and whipped cream the cake was frozen, which I suspect is not that unusual but took something off the experience). Ironically, most of the folks I was with said the same thing when comparing the actual meal and desert, which is an interesting comment. For the record, nobody left overly unhappy and we should have taken a walk before going back to the office (since at about 2pm severe sleepy-ness set in). Now If I were at Short Pump and wanted a nice meal I would certainly stop in...and maybe try the cheese cake again too but get some coffee to complete the meal."
Miranda C.,"Woodbridge, VA",0,24,5,5.0,12/10/2017,Mike Lowry AKA Dana C! BEST SERVER EVER! I love how you treated us ! I will be coming back to be served by you again !
Jordan S.,"Troutville, VA",259,87,52,5.0,11/21/2017,Huge fan! We make the four hour trip for this place alone. Great food and even better cheesecake. If you're debating on flavor try the Oreo or S'mores.. you will not be disappointed.
Monica O.,"Richmond, VA",4,100,148,5.0,8/12/2017,Exceptional food and great service. Reasonable prices however not exactly in correspondence to the portion of the food. But again I truly enjoyed the food. It didn't take a long time for the food to come out and I was very full especially because of the mini loaves of bread they provide
Philip H.,"Fredericksburg, VA",340,14,2,2.0,12/27/2017,This must be George Bush's favorite restaurant because there is an insane amount of oil in the food. Very greasy and overall not well prepared. The floors were slippery with grease and my picture shows how much oil came from one of our little plates. We put it in that small butter dish and that wasn't even half of it from one entree.
Dana M.,"Richmond, VA",11,190,19,4.0,10/13/2017,"As much as I want to hate this place (Idk why...lol!), and grumble how they're overpriced/rated...I just can't!  Over & over they are consistent, their service is top notch & their food -- really, really good!  Everything I've ever tried has been yummy (...& that's tough w/ their MASSIVE menu!) & their portions GINORMOUS!!!  The reason for the knocked off star?  It always smells like 'dirty rag' in there...."
Candyce B.,"Charlotte, NC",320,767,877,4.0,5/19/2017,"My family and I like to come here when I'm in town because the can accommodate a large group of us and satisfy everyone's taste.  This visit was no different! We arrived a little after noon and were seated immediately. Everyone ordered something different, there were crab cake sandwiches, salads, nachos, pastas, burgers and so much more.  I ordered the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp. It's a good mix of spicy and sweet while not being overwhelming. I'd recommend!  Of course we ordered cheesecake (to-go, because we were all stuffed). Pricey...but tasty!  And we all left full and happy."
Donna I.,"Richmond, VA",92,99,150,3.0,9/30/2017,"I love cheesecake and I love cheesecake! So coming here to celebrate my friends 40th birthday. We were a group of 11 so out wait time was lil more than an hour. We were seated in a nice area and we were truly enjoying being in the back of the restaurant. Our waitress seemed overwhelmed by the table size and we had to keep asking for items we already requested. I tried the skinilicious pasta and it was truly good. But of all things, the birthday girl ordered a well done burger and it was still red on the inside. It dampened our spirit for a moment. It was replaced but hindered our celebration. We were allowed to bring in a birthday cake and the birthday balloons."
Ferris-Venis H.,"Novi, MI",38,31,7,1.0,12/1/2017,"I have been to many cheesecake factories all over the country and I have never had bad service But this was the absolute worst restaurant I have ever been to.  The food was cold & we had to send back our mashed potatoes twice before they came out warm.  The service was terrible! So we decided to take her cheesecake home so I asked the waitress for an extra serving of raspberry sauce to go with my original cheesecake and she said no problem.  Apparently she forgot to put it in the bag which i realized before we left.  So I walked up to the cheesecake counter and asked the servers working behind the counter for an extra raspberry sauce.  I was appalled by their answer in which they told me I had to go back to my server to request an extra side.  Which I thought was ridiculous because they could have just handed it to me.  It's a tiny cup of raspberry sauce for god sake!   Instead I decided to walk up to the manager to tell him that they were rude and didn't want to help me and that our service was terrible to begin with.   Well that didn't help because apparently Rodney doesn't care about his customers.  The manager, Rodney proceeds to tell us ""we need to charge you for that"".  Are you freaking kidding me after I just spent $150 on dinner you're gonna charge me for a side of raspberry sauce to go with my cheesecake????  I was very upset about that!   it wasn't about the money but you're going to nickel and dime a customer for a tiny container of raspberry sauce????   are you that desperate cheesecake factory????  The worst part is he didn't do anything about it.  My husband and I left without the raspberry sauce to go with our cheesecake that we took home.  Rodney the so called ""manager"" could have cared less he didn't try to rectify the situation or anything  Which then tells me why the restaurant wasn't busy at all, why we had terrible service, & why the food was cold. Because if they have a manager that doesn't care about his customers then obviously he doesn't care about his job or anything else that's going on in the restaurant!!!! What a damn shame!!!!!!"
Jen S.,"Brookline, MA",135,260,172,5.0,9/26/2017,"This is a great location. Came here a few weeks ago with my sister and our bride to be friend. We had just taken her for her first Paint Night at Muse Bar. We just wanted some cheesecake after all that art making!! Our server Britney was the best. Very personable, very fast, very efficient...I wish she could have joined us for our late night snack :)"
McKenzie P.,"Richmond, VA",198,77,157,4.0,9/22/2017,"Recently visited Cheesecake with a group from work, I must say they are good at accommodating a large group and the service went smoothly however,I have been to cheesecake with a much smaller group and have had to wait forever! With that being said, if you are planning to go, I would definitely recommend a reservation. Cheesecake is a good pick for a large group (or small) because their menu is HUGE! They have so many options to chose from so you are bound to please everyone someway as well, they have cheesecake so duh that appeals to everyone! You can get the cheesecake to go as well, always a good option to have after you have eaten all your food and get stuffed easily like me!"
Ryan B.,"Richmond, VA",33,10,26,5.0,8/4/2017,Went with a bunch of friends Monday to take advantage of half off cheesecake. No wait which was awesome and a very pleasant waiter. He was very helpful with a bigger pa try  and was able to help us all without missing a step.  Wait for food was a bit long but the restaurant was packed. All the food was awesome as usual if u have ne her been I'd highly suggest it. Almost every thing on the menu is a home run.
Melanie C.,"Norfolk, VA",206,159,366,5.0,5/7/2017,My best friend and I decided to eat here today for lunch. You can never go wrong with the Cheesecake Factory! We had excellent service and the food tasted amazing. There was no wait (I am assuming this is because we came around 11:30). I ordered the Santa Fe Salad (this is one of my favorite dishes here) and it was PERFECT. It tasted great and was a big enough portion for two. I ended up taking about half of my salad home. Our waitress was very knowledgeable about the menu and informed us of the daily specials. She was quick to refill our drinks and checked in on us every now and then. I would highly suggest this Cheesecake Factory location!
Richard L B.,"Tampa, FL",463,148,410,3.0,3/21/2017,"30 minutes wait on a Thursday night.  Very busy. But always worth the wait. We ordered an appetizer deep fried mushrooms, zucchini and avocado. It was delicious.  I tried pasta special.  Something they were testing.  It was delicious.  Food came out before our appetizer.  But things happen.  Because of the server and great food didn't even matter to us. We over looked it. One of my favorite places to eat."
K E.,"Richmond, VA",0,5,,1.0,11/18/2017,"First and last time coming here. Unbelievably packed at 4:30. Gross egg roll sampler for appetizers. I was brought the wrong meal which i ending up eating due to time constraints. My wife got one of their million different chicken dishes and didn't eat half of it. Our bread arrived with the check because it had just come out of the oven. And don't forget our $8 a piece beer. Way over priced. This place would go perfect in an airport terminal. Applebees with cheesecake, at almost double the price."
Bernard L.,"Amelia Court House, VA",5,50,3,2.0,11/5/2017,"My first visit in a few years. Like always you have to wait. Was told 10-15 minutes. After about 20 minutes went inside and asked if they had tried notifying me on their vibrating, blinking device. They said yeah, stand over here. Never went off. Waitress was nice but after we ordered took about 20 minutes to get served bread. And another 30 to get the food. Ordered Steak Diane medium rare, come out medium well. No sauce on it either.  Potatoes were room temperature. The bread was good though. For the price, quality of food and wait I don't think I will be coming back."
Stacey O.,"Ansbach, Germany",182,2,1,1.0,10/27/2017,"I've never had a bad experience at the Cheesecake Factory until I came to this restaurant. The wait was entirely too long and once we were seated, it took and hour and a half just to receive our appetizer. The main entree never reached us so we requested that it be boxed up as a to go meal instead. The manager tried to rectify the issue but it just didn't measure up to the standard of service I'm used too."
Muhammad R.,"Glen Allen, VA",68,86,60,2.0,1/14/2017,"I've been to Cheesecake Factory a handful of times in a few different cities. I think it's a pretty safe, stable, less-than-adventurous type of place to eat at.  Without a doubt, it's popularity is something that obviously means it's good, but it isn't for everyone. I spend some time at home trying new things and cooking for myself and my wife. That being said, with the right ingredients, I could probably successfully attempt everything and anything on their menu.  During this particular dining session at TCF, I ordered the Chicken Madeira with a side of mashed potatoes. The dish was delicious but it didn't wow me. The chicken was perfectly cooked and the mashed potatoes were a nice texture. The sauce was sweet and savory, but again, nothing to leave me craving more at the end. I paid almost $20 for it so I expected it to be $20/plate good.  My cousin had the fish and chips and my mom and dad had some shrimp pasta that looked okay. All parties stated their meal was enjoyable and they ate their fill. For someone very picky or not adventurous in the flavor department, the TCF menu is beyond satisfactory.  The service at TCF is always pretty decent. Although this time, we sat near the kitchen exit and I think no less than 20 plates were broken during our dining session. Every few minutes it was glass breaking!! You could probably lower the prices if the wait staff was more careful with the dishes. Also it didn't help that a server dumped her drink tray right next to our table and decided to douse my cowboy boots in water. :-/ no bueno. Didn't make a big deal out of it because she seemed to be having a rough day.  Oh well. TCF leaves more to be desired and I want to write a 5* review for it but it just doesn't earn in. I'm sure I'll meander into another one in a few years, but it's definitely not a ""Go-to"" type of place for me."
David L.,"Williamsburg, VA",2,113,321,2.0,1/19/2017,"The good thing is all the restaurants tastes the same.  But the menu is annoying cuz it's so big it's quite stressful, the pricing is over the top for the quality. Nothing seems to taste extraordinary but everything tastes average."
Margaret M.,"Kutztown, PA",0,6,,1.0,11/2/2017,We were a party of 12 so they said it would be 1.5 hours wait time. We were ok with that since it was a nice night out. We waited outside on some benches. An hour and a half came and went. They just kept seating people who had smaller parties even though they came after us. Finally around 8:30pm a table for 6 came available so we had the teens sit so they could order. They had to swim early in the morning so we just wanted them to eat already. The table right next to it opened shortly after that but they wouldn't let the parents sit there claiming that they were holding it for someone else. But what about us? Why weren't they saving us a couple of tables an hour ago?! Terrible management! Food wasn't worth the wait! Don't go!
Abhilash M.,"Middletown, CT",0,10,2,5.0,10/15/2017,"Being located in Short pump mall, This restaurant has very good ambience for outdoor seating. Staff is great . Taste of food was awesome ! Will definitely visit again"
Brian D.,"Jacksonville, FL",113,294,91,3.0,11/18/2016,"Big menu.  Awesome cheesecakes!   What more do you need to know? Ok, so I was up in Richmond on business and we decided to find something better than what is on the east side of the town.    We were directed to this area.   Having been to Cheesecake Factories before, we knew what we would be getting.    The place was kind of busy both times we ate here.   So both times we ate at the bar.    Service is ok at the bar.  Bartenders are busy making drinks for the tables while entertaining those at the bar.    The food is good.  Portions are large.     There is something on the menu for everyone's taste.  If someone can't find something to eat on the menu, I can't imaging what what they eat.    And of course the cheesecakes are the bomb!"
Don C.,"Waynesboro, VA",4,100,69,4.0,9/20/2017,"Always crowded, of course this was Friday night.  Nevertheless we were instantly seated.   Food was great, I had a hamburger and fries, Janie had chicken enchiladas.  I'd hoped the burger would be bigger, but it was good.  Avocado toast was fun to start, and Snickers cheesecake at the end was great.  We had a good time, This is a nice one, fun place..."
Priscila C.,"Henrico, VA",60,20,2,4.0,10/21/2017,"Chicken Parmesan Pizza Style is delicious! Last time they gave me much more pasta though, enough to share the dish. It was also a little light on the sauce but still good."
David K.,"Sandy Hook, VA",0,14,,1.0,12/9/2017,"When this place first opened I would have given them 5 stars. After years of going here this place has gone down the tube. Tonight was the last straw. Being the holidays I understand the place is overwhelmed and mistakes can happen. With that said let me begin the end of cheesecake for us. We came in tonight with low expectations, within 20 minutes we had our table squeezed right in with other diners, when I say squeezed we hit elbows every second with the staff. Our waiter comes over and grabs my shoulder to tell me he will be right with us, why did he grab my shoulder? Not a germ-a-phobe, but still weird. Next I was paying attention to everyone around while we waited for our waiter to comeback to take our drink order. You could easily hear everyone's conversation, so you would think people wouldn't be talking about such personal topics, but people did. Just a very uncomfortable situation, not romantic at all. Finally we get our drink orders in and then our entree. Had to skip the Mac and cheese balls that used to be sooooo goooood, now they taste like a big ball of grease. Found that out last time. So my wife's food comes out, she got the Shepard Pie, which was horrible, they didn't cook the vegetables in the pie so everything was creamy warm and soft mixed with hard frozen carrots. But my food didn't come. Didn't think it was weird because one the people beside us didn't receive their food with the rest of her group. She got her plate about 10 minutes later. So after about 2 minutes of waiting our waiter came back to tell me he forgot to put my order in and it will be up real quick. What!?! You forgot to put my order in? How hard is your job? Anyways I don't want to mean. Then after 7 minutes of waiting, watching my wife pick through her food, a manager comes and tells me how upset she was and that my food would be right up. My level of frustration is about a 7 at this time. 15 minutes in and out waiter returns to tell me my food should be out any minute, frustration level now a 10. Told him to forget about it, wrap my wife's food up and send me a check. He says no problem and he will take my entree off the bill and someone will still bring it to me in a to go box. You damn right you're taking it off my check and no I don't want it anymore. Another 6 minutes go buy to get the check paid and I gave the crappy waiter a small tip anyways, because that's the kind of person I am. Started to head out when another manager comes up and hands me my entree I took it and placed it on the floor and my wife left her food too and we headed out the door never to comeback. We have ate here what feels like 50 times since it opened, always leave 25-30 percent tips, even when the service was bad or the food was nasty. Tonight was the last straw. I highly recommend no one to come here. It's not date friendly nor family friendly. I don't even know if they know what they are with 2 big screen tvs playing sports at the bar that the whole restaurant can see in their weird Roman theme paint job. Would give them negative stars if I could. Please stay away from them."
Maggie P.,"Richmond, VA",20,2,,2.0,9/20/2017,Great food but awfully inconvenient. I was hoping to make a reservation for my birthday but they don't do reservations on weekend nights which is the probably the only time you actually need a reservation because they get so busy. They couldn't even give me an estimate of a wait time when I called ahead and asked.
Tammy D.,"Mechanicsville, VA",261,27,26,2.0,6/22/2017,"If the theme of the night was...waiting...over...and...over, then the moto was: No extra efforts wasted on them! Do not get me wrong, I LOVE the Cheesecake Factory CHEESECAKE!  Yet, when our son and his wife and children tried to take us out for a Mother's Day/Father's Day Dinner, the overall experience was horrible.   #1 - We were told 20 minutes to wait, given a buzzer, and proceeded to wait for nearly an hour! When my daughter-in-law went up to the desk and asked how much longer, she was informed that we had been called already (mind you we were only about 6 ft away from the desk and clearly visible)!  She, of course, informed them that it did not go off. At which time he said, 'yes, we know, there is a technical issue'.  - Wait - What? - So you knew the buzzer did not work, AND you saw us standing, only a few feet from you...and you did not bother to step out and let us know, OK, maybe you didn't want to move from behind the desk, so, you could not even just call our name out?  No..they gave our table away!  He assured her we would get the next open table (Again...what kept you from calling out our name in order to get our table?)! #2 - Once we were FINALLY seated (in a booth - which is a problem, b/c I am disabled from MS and it is difficult for me to 'slide' in place - when asked about it and to get a regular table, they said they did not have any; yet were cleaning off tables across from us).  The waiter did not even get around to our table for nearly 10+ minutes.  Once he did, it was for a quick 'hello' & 'be right with you'.  We had to stop him & ask if we could get drinks?  It did not get better from there. #3 - From that point on, it was not much better. It seems the theme of the night was...waiting...over...and...over! We had to wait too long for food, too long to ask for napkins, too long for refills...you see where I am going with this.  #4 - In regard to the food, I will simply say, my son was in the bathroom before we left.  My giant cobb salad was mostly a heap of iceberg lettuce, with shaved chicken here and there along with shaved hard boiled egg on the edge of bowl - not at all worth the money, let alone eating.   #5 - The one saving grace we looked forward to was what everyone ultimately comes there for - the cheesecake!  We were so ready to go that we order them to go (taking nearly 15+ min).  When we stepped outside to say our goodbyes and go our separate ways, I went to divvy up the cheesecakes to the right person, it was suddenly clear that one was missing.  In I marched to the desk and told the girl that I was missing a cheesecake. She asked who my server was, as I gave description she knew and the disappeared to find him.  I did not tell what type I was missing. Our of the kitchen door our waiter appears, headed straight in my direction, I start to say something and he cuts me off and says, 'You are missing a red velvet cheesecake, right?' If he knew without anyone telling him, means he knew before we left and we were only steps right outside of their door - he could have simply looked out the door even.  No extra efforts wasted on them seems to be the moto! I was very disappointed from the front door, to our seating, wait staff, food and the finale of  the lack of concern!  Save your money and order the cheesecake online...it will save you frustrations, time and money."
Lindsay C.,"Virginia Beach, VA",57,18,21,4.0,5/13/2017,"Good food, great cheesecake! Had an amazing lunch date with the kids and my mom. The food was good and didn't take too long. We were so stuffed, we took our cheesecake to go. Only reason I didn't give 5 stars was because the parking is awful and there is always a wait, but it is worth it!"
Krystle E.,"Glen Allen, VA",52,66,36,3.0,2/8/2017,"Went here for a lunch with co-workers. We came for our lunch break expecting it not to be more than 1.5 hours to eat and enjoy. Unfortunately it wasn't so. We ordered our apps and meals at the same time. Apps came out in great time, unfortunately the entree came out when we needed to leave and come back to work. So we weren't able to enjoy it there in house. We were there for roughly an hour and 15 minutes, and ordered our food within 10-15 minutes of being seated. The service from the staff was extraordinary. They were polite, and we never had our beverage empty. The food was mediocre, i know i can come here for a satisfactory meal. This wouldn't be a place i frequent for a meal, but would definitely be the place i frequent for dessert."
Marissa B.,"Richmond, VA",104,92,143,3.0,7/2/2016,"A solid 3 stars. Nothing super spectacular, but nothing too terrible. It's a nice place to have either a casual or semi-fancy dinner. Service is hit or miss; the servers are usually nice, but they seem to disappear for a long time or not refill drinks, as was my experience tonight with the bf's family.  The menu is huge and literally has anything you can think of, both picky eaters and those with an adventurous palette will not be disappointed. I usually go for the teriyaki chicken or some pasta dish [where the portions are huge], but tonight I tried the seared tuna tataki salad. It seemed enticing, the flavor combinations sounded great [rare ahi tuna, avocado, mixed greens tossed in wasabi vinaigrette], but it was not worth the $19 price tag. For that price, you would expect a large portion of tuna, more variety of veggies, something out of this world. I'm sad to say that this dish didn't particularly deliver, unlike other offerings I've had in the past. The salad was also not very filling; if it weren't for the super delicious complementary brown bread, I wouldn't have been full. Again, the salad itself was prepared nice, lightly dressed, and delicious, but not worth the high price tag. You can get an order of tuna tartare from the appetizer menu for the same amount of tuna, but for $10 or so. I would personally stick with the desserts [the vanilla bean cheesecake is my all time favorite], they definitely do cheesecake well. The appetizers/small plates are always affordable and tasty, and the ""specialties"", burgers, pastas, and other entrees are where you'll get the best value for your dollar. All in all, a decent restaurant; I'm sure I'll be back to try something else from their gargantuan menu, just not super soon, haha."
Kendall N.,"Kilmarnock, VA",0,5,1,3.0,8/20/2017,The service is wonderful here this my 4th time within thr last 2 months and i tell you its delicious
Mike P.,"Glen Allen, VA",8,2,,2.0,1/31/2017,"If you have a party larger than 4, don't waste your time. We tried  to have an office Christmas party (10 people) here and were told ""No, we don't take reservations and we will have to split you up into three different tables not close to each other"".  The next time we went was for a family bday.  We asked for a table for 6 and were told the wait would be 3 hours.  Other (smaller parties) were quoted a 30 min wait.    The food here is good, but not ""three hour wait"" good.  The Cheesecake is great, but you might have to get it to go if ya have a party bigger than 4. If they were more accommodating to larger parties, I would have given them 4 stars (3 for the food and 5 for the cheesecake).  However, we were essentially turned away twice."
Courtney A.,"Richmond, VA",80,54,96,2.0,12/16/2016,Pretty overpriced and despite having a Harry Potter book sized menu - I didn't enjoy many of the selections. This was my first time going and it was kind of over-hyped. The cheesecake is excellent. I would go back just to order some to-go.
Twana J.,"Glen Allen, VA",9,15,46,4.0,1/23/2017,This was one of the best waffles I have eaten in a long time.  I will be going back and I know what will be on my order. Waffles and that bang bang shrimp.... yummy!! 5 stars not given because of the waitress. She was quite short with us when we asked certain questions and she was not as attentive as I'm use too having at a restaurant. Over all it was good eating....
Joy B.,"Laurel, MD",0,3,,1.0,7/20/2017,"I called to order an entrée and dessert for curbside pick up. Calling the order in was decent. When picking the order up, I had to park in a curbside parking spot and call the number to let staff know I was there. I called and called....no pick up. Called again - no pick up. I then called the main line. I was able to let them know I was outside.  Once I opened the food at the dinner table, everything was COLD. The warm apple crisp dessert was COLD. The pasta with bland and poorly seasoned chicken patties was COLD. The good thing was that the butter and ice cream were cold.  No bueno this time. I will probably just stick to ordering cheesecake :("
