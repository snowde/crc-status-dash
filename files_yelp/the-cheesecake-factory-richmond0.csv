Shelly D.,"Lockport, NY",0,9,,1.0,8/14/2013,Was told a 15 min wait time that turned into an hour and 15 min!!  When we asked when we would get seated we were told another 45 min. When we complained about how long we already waited past the time we were told we got an attitude and was told she didn't really know because she just came on shift!! Once seated they forgot a few things we ordered and I has to wait on my crab bites because they kept burning them.   They were just ok.  The nachos and lettuce wraps were not good.  My daughters burger she said was dry and had no flavor. My husbands hibachi steak was ok.  Not a fan and don't plan to go back.
Dana C.,"Henrico, VA",0,11,,1.0,9/29/2014,"I'm only giving one star because i had to. Went for my daughter's birthday and asked the hostess if they did anything special for birthdays and they said yes, took her name and age on a special pink pad and gave it to the person seating us. Nothing happened. No singing, no nothing. The food was sup par as well. Shrimp and burgers were overcooked.  We won't be back.  That was a $73.00 disaster."
David R T.,"Chester, VA",0,19,,2.0,1/23/2013,"Don't get the ""Chicken Chilli"". It is too spicy, has mystery chicken meat, and beans not typical beans in chilli. Partly my fault in ordering this dish, but fully described on menu. I went out on a limb when I ordered it."
Angel S.,"Glen Allen, VA",12,7,,2.0,1/2/2013,"The wait for dinner is awful, and you would think it would be because the food is so good but it is not. The bar area is small, so no big deal there. The only reason people come here is the name, but it is not worth the wait or he price. The only reason this got 2 stars and not 1 star is because my in laws really like their meals. I will not be going back."
Aviva S.,"Richmond, VA",0,2,,5.0,8/9/2014,"I ate there today and WOW! The menu is a little daunting, but our server was super-helpful and seemed to know a lot about how everything is made and seasoned. I'm kind of a pain at restaurants because I can't eat gluten but there are lots of GF options here, and I overheard the manager answering a question at a nearby table about whether they use separate water to cook their GF pasta (YES!) so clearly they know what they are doing. I had their Pasta Carbonara with GF pasta and it was delicious! Flavorful and rich and everything I had hoped it would be! For dessert I had their Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake, which is also GF, and it was less a dessert and more a religious experience, LOL! My group didn't have to wait, but then we had stopped in and reserved a table ahead of time. My best advice would be to plan ahead, let the staff help you navigate that giant menu, and wear stretchy pants :)"
Matthew L.,"Baltimore, MD",990,726,161,3.0,4/15/2009,"This is a really large Cheesecake factory, but still overcrowded.  I chalk it up to simple southern tastes.  Same large menu, same large portions, same dessert.  As usual next to the mall.  Not bad, just not special."
Chris J.,"Duffield, VA",0,27,,3.0,7/26/2011,"I am a huge fan of cheesecake and an enormous fan of the Cheesecake factory but theres one thing. The other night I entered this fine establishment with my significant other with a large sum of money ready to treat my other to a fine dining experience, as it was our anniversary and I have had numerous good experiences here. This was a bizzare night though, I would not reccomend going on July 4th as apparently it is ""Treat a customer strangely day"" or so they would have me believe. First, as I entered the host (who was very nice mind you) asked for my number, i politely informed him i was not gay but appreciated the compliment, he got shy and handed me off to the next host, who promptly leaned over and offered to enter his coworkers number into my phone secretly without my girlfriend knowing, I again politely refused and everyone laughed lightheartedly. After we brushed that off, a waiter came running to the table and gave us a cheesecake, without ordering one and said sorry for the wait, we didn't understand but he left before we could object so we simply ate that. The new waiter came up and all but screamed at us for eating cheesecake before our appetizer, I did not understand if this was a joke or not.  Later that night, they let some people in wheelchairs sit next to us which ruined our apetites, I didn't think that was right.  Anyways, aside from the strange occurances the food was outstanding, I just don't understand why there were so many asian employees?"
Marie L.,"Richmond, VA",0,33,,4.0,8/18/2011,"I have eaten at this location a few times, and have thouroughly enjoyed my lunches that I have had there.  The pizza is surprisingly delicious and better than most pizzerias in the area...it is huge - I always have leftovers to bring home.  They have a chicken dish (exact name eluding me at the moment) that is lightly breaded and served with a really good lemon sauce on top with mashed potatoes - yum.  The peanut butter cup cheesecake is my favorite and do try the strawberry lemonade (comes with a sugar ring on the top of the glass which adds to the lemonade)."
C M.,"Richmond, VA",1,20,,1.0,7/13/2014,"won't be eating here again, which is a shame as CCF used to be my favorite restaurant.  now, the only thing it has going is the nice ambiance. the customer service has really gone downhill.  too bad!"
Melissa M.,"Bowie, MD",11,41,24,5.0,3/23/2011,"I had to stop at the Cheesecake factory inn Richmond as this is one of my favorite restaurants. I arrived around 1:30pm and was seated outside. It was chilly this day, but they have these awesome heat lamps by each table. I was warm and toasty and enjoyed my sandwich and salad. The waitress was nice, but even nicer to my buddy that was with me...I guess because he's really handsome! All in all, a great experience."
Chris C.,"Glen Allen, VA",4,62,,1.0,8/30/2012,Quality of food and service has gone down considerably. We had the waitress Jenny and she spent her time speaking with other waiters rather than attending to her tables. Too many teenage servers.
Kiara B.,"Washington, DC",36,79,11,5.0,5/13/2008,"All I have to say- AMAZING! I was very pleased with the service I received at this restaurant. I actually ate here for one of my friend's birthday, and we had a great time. First of all, the service was very good. Despite the large amount of people at the restaurant, we actually received our food in a timely manner. Also, our waiter was pretty hot and incredibly nice. Second, I was pleased with the food. For our appetizer, we ordered nachos and quesadillas, and we were very pleased with them. For the main dish, I ordered  the 3 cheese (Maybe 4 cheese?) pasta and it was delicious. One of the best pasta dishes I have ever had in my entire life. I was way too stuffed to actually have a dessert, but I had a bite of my friends (some sort of chocolate cheesecake) and, of course, it was very pleasing. Overall, I would definitely recommend a trip to this location. I am definitely going back!"
Katelyn S.,"Fredericksburg, VA",6,149,4,4.0,2/24/2013,Pretty decent food. I admit the first couple times I went I didn't really like it that much but I've grown to love it. The cheesecake is awesome. I love it. And they have a variety of food to choose from. Always stop here when shopping at Shortpump.
Roger Y.,"Richmond, VA",43,100,64,2.0,6/9/2012,"Hmmmm..... this place does way too many items. The cheesecake is good though. Everything caters to Americans' ever-expanding waistlines: huge portions, salt, butter, and heavy cream. That is why they do a good business."
Janet F.,"Morgantown, WV",29,197,,4.0,5/15/2010,"Stopped in here for desert after doing Brazilian steakhouse for dinner on a Saturday night. The cheesecake was, as expected, fabulous! The trouble is, it was so loud in the restaurant that it was very difficult for the order taker to hear what kind of cake we wanted. Additionally, it was hard to even get to the area where you can buy slices of cake a la carte to go because it was so crowded and the staff seemed indifferent to make it any easier for those customers just wanting to take out some cake."
Kristina S.,"Glen Allen, VA",0,4,,2.0,2/7/2013,"So I know that cheesecake factory is supposed to be this great restaurant, but i wasnt that impressed. The menu was ridiculous, how can you specialize in any one great food, or style, when you have a thousand options ranging from pasta, to meatloaf, to pizza, to chinese....and on and on. We ordered a white spinach pizza and it was just so so....also the cheesecake (caramel creme brulee) was really heavy. I felt like it was all overdone and unnecessary. Instead of doing a few things exceptionally, they do a thousand things not all that well.  Again, not impressed. I probably wont go there again unless its happy hour. The drinks are way overpriced as is the food. Not a Fan."
Patrick M.,"Holmdel, NJ",135,392,266,4.0,11/26/2007,"Dining in at The Cheesecake Factory is a little too slow of a business traveler have dinner by himself.  However, the large menu makes it a great take out restaurant.    Lately, I have been ordering the Tex Mex Egg rolls and the California Omelet.  Way too much food for one person."
Brad R.,"Henrico, VA",0,37,,2.0,3/26/2012,Overall good atmosphere and good staff. I've been here twice but the second time I got food poisoning. Not fun :(
Jacob P.,"Henrico, VA",1,17,1,5.0,3/11/2011,"Happened to have a few gift cards to this high quality, high cost restaurant and was glad to have gone with a date.  This restaurant is perfect as a special occasion date night, and the service allowed for us to take the meal as slow as we wanted (about an hour and 45).  The restaurant has a full bar.  My date started off with a blueberry mojito which was perfectly mixed, and I was able to choose Stella Artois on tap from the list of high quality beers on tap including Yuengling and Blue Moon.  For an appetizer, we tried the Vietnamese Tacos which we would recommend for any open minded foodie Yelpers out there.  For dinner, both of us had steak dishes: Steak Diane and a Petite Filet topped with mushrooms.  Although the Steak Diane was a bit more well done than the medium I had hoped for, the Filet was very tender and tasty.  For dessert we both had cheesecake, and there is a reason they named the place after it.  If you don't save room after the very large portions to eat some cheesecake, you'll be mad at yourself.  The Dutch Apple Streusel and the Lemon Raspberry cheesecakes were amazing with every bite and perfectly made.  If I could afford, I'd go here far more often, but at this point, knowing an excellent celebration spot is enough for me."
