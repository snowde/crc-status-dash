Cybill Y.,"Henrico, VA",23,11,2,4.0,10/4/2015,"I love the skinnylicious menu! Great to know which items on the menu are perfect for those watching their calories. The serving size is huge. Miso salmon is good, though the flavor was bit too overpowering. The low calorie cheesecake was really good. Highly recommended.  Service is great as well. Place is big but can still get packed on a weekend."
Vishal P.,"Glen Allen, VA",2,10,,2.0,8/11/2015,"We went for lunch last Saturday to celebrate my wife's birthday. (We've been going to Cheesecake Factory to celebrate her birthday since last four years now.)  For appetizers we almost always go for the delicious Avocado Egg Rolls. After finishing appetizers and drinks, we decided to take-home the main course as the kids started to act up a little. My wife decided to try Farfalle With Chicken And Roasted Garlic. But being a vegetarian, she requested to hold the chicken. She asked whether it would be possible to add a few more vegetables as a replacement to chicken, and the waitress said yes. After the kids went to bed, we lit up some candles and sat down at the table to have a romantic birthday dinner. But alas, the pasta dish that my wife ordered had bacon in it. A lots of it! She gets repelled by meat, and just couldn't eat any of it.  This, in spite of our clear instructions to the waitress about her being a vegetarian. Overall, we like the place. The place is always crowded, but we hardly ever had to wait more than 20 minutes to get a table. The staff is usually friendly. BUT if you're a vegetarian, and ask them to hold the chicken, beware!"
Chandler S.,"Henrico, VA",123,23,41,2.0,8/10/2015,"I have never been a fan of The Cheesecake Factory in the past but I decided to give them a try for brunch. Again, I was disappointed. The french toast was tasteless and really like eating a giant hunk of bread. The syrup did not do it any justice because it also lacked a delightful taste. I waited for 10 minutes before my waitress came to say she would be longer. Being that it was a warm day and I was seated on the patio a glass of water would have been nice.  My food came out before the bread for the table arrived. Overall i was not pleased with my food or service. I will probly not go back for food but the cheesecake is still amazing."
Kathryn G.,"Arlington, VA",33,19,7,1.0,4/9/2016,"Everything started great, I was at the bar, nice bartenders. Good cold Pina colada.  And then at the end of my salad, I bit into a peanut. I am so allergic to them. I had to run into the bathroom after spitting out my food and rinse my mouth. I had to run out of the Restraunt to go to the doctors. I'm at the doctors now. I paid 30$ to get poisoned. I've never had this problem before at any other Cheesecake Factory. This is unacceptable."
Gary A.,"Clearfield, UT",1,47,,3.0,12/7/2016,"The service was average and the food was just okay.   I usually really love Cheesecake Factory, but I was not impressed this time."
Beth M.,"Midlothian, VA",23,232,371,1.0,3/19/2016,"It's hot and cold. Sometimes they deliver and sometimes they don't. But, when they fail, they fail big. We had a nice waitress - not overly attentive (it was 5pm mid-week, it wasn't busy). The kitchen failed miserably - didn't make our app and when they did it was 1/2 cooked. My sandwich was a mess. Forgot my side. Nothing tasted bad but it was frustrating. And Cheesecake is NOT cheap (aka overpriced). So, I would have expected our nice waitress to do something to account for the kitchen's major fails. Nope. Nothing. She smiled and dropped off our bill and ran. The place has had more bad days then good lately and the floor is slippery and the place smells sour. It needs a good cleaning, and a general refresh of staff and kitchen. They shouldn't rest on their laurels - despite the fact that the people keep coming. More is expected of the chain."
Anuj B.,"Henrico, VA",20,83,138,5.0,5/19/2015,"I can't give it less than 5 stars. You might say I am biased but have all the reasons to be biased. The ambience and flavor of food is just phenomenal. Cheesecake Factory doesn't need a review as everyone knows it's pure value for your time and money.  The restaurant staff is very courteous and you will be seated asap, that's their mission. Music is good and it depends which location you are seated. If I go myself, I usually sit in the bar area.  I orders cashew spicy chicken, dogfish beer tall and tiramisu cheesecake and I will tell you, all came out pretty good. It was worth sketching out an evening in the one of favorite restaurant by yourself."
Citizen J.,"Mesa, AZ",0,19,5,3.0,5/23/2016,Great ambiance but way overpriced for one small slice of cheesecake.  Waitress was professional and nice. A little dark in there and the floor was very slippery as in I was sliding on grease or spilled food. I would recommend shoes and a caution wet floor sign. Accident waiting to happen.
Jason D.,"Mechanicsville, VA",1,38,1,3.0,4/2/2016,Crabcake sandwich  was great. Not sure why this place draws so many people though.  The mass of food and the size of the patrons puts me off. Decor was nice.
Kate M.,"Richmond, VA",5,63,63,4.0,4/4/2015,"Super long wait, that's my only complaint. I'm not even that mad about the wait itself, because they can't control that. I'm mad that they told us that we would be seated by 6:30, and then we weren't seated until 7:30.  Anyways, other than that, the food was amazing. It was a little pricy, but the servings were huge. It's a hard place to go on a diet, but the ""skinnylicious"" menu had a lot of great options (not just salad or chicken like most skinny menus have). I got the skinny shrimp and pasta! Also, we had the fried macaroni and cheese balls. THEY WERE AMAZING omg. Everything there is delicious!!!"
Jo M.,"Boston, MA",13,104,18,3.0,4/22/2015,"So it's a Cheesecake Factory. If you've been to one, you've been to them all, and this location is no different. I've gotten take out a couple of times, and it's always been quite good. They're really good about making sure my dishes are hot (like straight out of the oven hot) so that they're not cold by the time I make it to the hotel. The Louisiana Chicken Pasta was a treat, and they even made me an entrée sized mac and cheese when I was craving one. I usually grab a drink at the bar while I'm waiting for my food, and this is where they fall down a little. The bartenders are not nearly as attentive as I would have expected. I can understand that they're making drinks for the entire restaurant, but on my last trip I sat at an empty bar, in a near empty restaurant for 5 minutes before the bartender stopped chatting to a waitress and offered to get me a drink. Not happy.  Overall, it's a decent place to eat. Just be prepared for giant helpings!"
C S.,"Richmond, VA",1,106,8,2.0,11/9/2015,The cheesecake factory is ONLY good for cheesecakes and cakes.  Do NOT dine here if you don't have to.  I have been extremely disappointed dining here on three separate occasions!  The food is disgusting and bland to the max!
Roy G.,"Chesterfield, VA",17,5,6,3.0,4/7/2016,"This cheesecake factory used to be my favorite restaurant so it actually hurts me to have to say that I'm not sure what happened but this place got real casual lately.  They don't bring the bread out you have to ask whoever walks by for it because your server is MIA ... The whole time by the way.  The appetizer and appetizer plates stayed on the table the whole time.  Never offered to fill up water or remove any of the plates.  Server was MIA so never once came to ask how everything was.  They used to box up your food for you now you do it yourself.  Like I said real casual.   I always order the bistro shrimp pasta in which they used to offer freshly grated cheese to go on top now apparently you have to request it.   So if this is your first time I guess you won't even know they offer freshly grated cheese.   And the restaurant was freezing!!! It was not cold but super uncomfortably c o l d the entire time.   And I'm not a cold person like that usually.   The food was still good but the service was pretty crappy for Cheesecake Factory.   So this is more against the server, service and management and not the restaurant.   However they represent Cheesecake Factory.  I hope this was a one time thing and hope for a better experience next time.   There's better service at the Waffle House on Jeff Davis than this and that's ridiculous."
Chung L.,"Henrico, VA",0,3,1,1.0,4/5/2016,"My experience has overall the worst. The steak that I ordered was smaller than what the waitress said and when I asked for medium they gave it to me as rare, so rare that if you poke it blood comes gushing out. The waitress was also so rude and seem to only want us to leave."
Bryan H.,"Richmond, VA",98,5,,2.0,3/31/2016,"Okay food, horrible service - the food was pretty good, but not for the high price tag. It would have been okay had the service not been abysmal. I had heard such great things about The Cheesecake Factory that I had to try it. My wife and I went in at 2:30 on a Thursday (they were not busy), and our server was very inattentive and would forget simple requests such as a refill, and an extra plate. I eventually had to ask another waitress. Huge letdown and I do not think I will be returning."
Cassandra G.,"Forest, VA",2,71,33,4.0,4/11/2015,"I always like the Cheesecake Factory, but it took way too long for the food to come out and the waitress really didn't pay us much attention. Which I didn't understand bc it was 10pm and pretty empty.  Didn't have any cheesecake, but my chicken tacos were good. :)"
Amal H.,"Richmond, VA",3,30,31,4.0,2/12/2015,"I really love the cheese cake factory. I always go there with my friends. It is a bit pricy, but what ever. Who outs a price on fun :). Garlic bread is a must have! I am a steak lover, i have tastes the steak mignon, and this other peppered steak thingy ( i always forget the name, i think steak dian)  both are delicious. I have tried the s'mors, white chocolate macadamia, godiva, dolce de lece, red velvet, and lemon something all good. My fave was s'mors. Great place, i love coming here with friends.  The only reason why i took a star away was because of the stupid no reservation crap. I called to reserve a table for 13 and apparently they do not reserve!!!!!!!!! Like seriously we are 13 people, wtf!"
Cindy E.,"Norfolk, VA",185,392,550,1.0,8/19/2013,"If I had to eat a meal here...never mind, I really would never eat a meal here again.  Not just this Cheesecake Factory specifically.  ANY Cheesecake Factory. I've tried the omelettes.  I've tried the burgers.  The pasta dishes.  Several appetizers.  And the only thing I've ever enjoyed is the cheesecake.  The Vanilla Bean is my absolute fave. This weekend I tried the potstickers.  They were drowning in a pool of something disgustingly similiar to soy sauce.  I asked the server for a small plate so that I could rescue my potstickers.  She took too long; the sauce had already become one with the dumpling.  They were completely ruined.  And I'm not sure they would've been good had I requested no ""sauce.""  The texture of the filling was just...off. I really despise this place.  Just be a cheesecake factory.  Don't have a 22-page menu of horribleness.  I'd really be impressed with just 22 different kinds of cheesecake."
Deborah B.,"Mechanicsville, VA",75,147,193,4.0,2/22/2013,"The Cheesecake Factory is consistently a favorite. The service is always good, the food is always great and the atmosphere is really nice. Not to mention it's in Short Pump Mall, so it's convenient to grab a bite and do some shopping. My only complaint is PARKING.. like I said, it's at the Mall, so be prepared to deal with traffic and a shortage of parking spots.  IMHO, it's a great place to meet with friends or celebrate any occassion!"
Shay B.,"Newport News, VA",44,2,1,2.0,2/8/2016,"Food lacks flavor. My garlic pasta was soupy. Added chicken and received a chicken wing on it. Not sure what that is all about?? Fish n chips was okay, but fries were undercooked and mushy."
