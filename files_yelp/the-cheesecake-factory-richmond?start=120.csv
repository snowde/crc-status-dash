Janos S.,"Staunton, VA",0,3,,1.0,10/1/2016,"8 inch cheesecakes for $60, 89% fat per slice, and eggs (who puts eggs in cheesecake?). The cheesecake smelled like raw eggs. If you pay for shipping it's $20. You may be able to sign up or whatever for free shipping, but still...."
Lisa W.,"Mechanicsville, VA",0,7,,2.0,5/5/2015,1. I LOVE their food! I seriously don't think I've ever had anything I didn't like there. BUT... 2. Their tables are WAY too close to each other. Last time I went they tried to sit us at a 2 person table that you had to scoot sideways to get into because there were other people so close on both sides. We asked to wait for another table and so did 3 groups after us that they tried to sit there we noticed. I'd rather wait longer for a table than have a meal where you are uncomfortable the whole time.
Shari S.,"Capitola, CA",62,148,64,4.0,7/15/2014,"The Santa Fe Salad. Oh MY. It was massive & absolutely delicious. Hubs, who isn't a salad person, proclaimed it quite tasty as well. I love salads that are chopped finely & already dressed, so you get a perfect combination of flavors in every bite. This salad meets that requirement to a T (tea? tee? what's up with that phrase anyway?!). Grammar aside, I've got a pretty strong case of like going on for this dish, and can't wait to try it again. One gripe if you will about Cheesecake Factory: their portions are SO huge that I never have room afterwards for cheesecake! And since I'm rarely going home straight afterwards, getting a slice to go isn't an option either. But hey, if that's the worst thing I have to complain about, I'd say I came out ahead."
Devin H.,"Fayetteville, NC",94,85,61,5.0,3/2/2015,"I wouldn't normally give a place that I waited 2 hours to get seated 5 stars but I absolutely loved the place. We were at a near by hotel meeting up with some friends and have always wanted to go to a Cheesecake Factory.To start things off sure there was a large wait, but it's The Cheesecake Factory on a Saturday evening. There is an amazing outdoor mall right beside the restaurant so that makes the wait time less stressful. We did some walking around and then decided to hang near the bar for a bit. I will admit that the bar was super packed but I got all the help that I needed from not only the bar tenders but also the waiters as well. Like I said before, it's a well known restaurant on a Saturday night. When we finally got seated our waitress, Abby was very helpful and attentive. The food is actually fairly priced and the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp was out of this world!! I wound give 10 stars to the food alone. Of course you have to finish with a cheesecake duh! There's over 25 different kinds and if you like Tiramisu then don't bother looking because it's heavenly. They were even nice enough to point is in the direction of a good bar near our hotel. All in all, if you don't mind a wait, definitely check this place out if you are in Richmond."
Han V.,"Richmond, VA",723,472,734,3.0,1/18/2013,"Fun place to go for happy hour from 4-6pm on weekdays where certain drinks and appetizers are $5. Their mojitos are my favorite. Happy hour is only available in the bar area so arrive early if you can! Otherwise, their food is consistent to every other Cheesecake Factory. Food: 3 Value [HH]: 4 Service: 3 Overall: 3"
Sarah M.,"Henrico, VA",0,16,2,1.0,7/14/2016,"The staff are so rude! I'm not a difficult customer, I went there on a big day for me to celebrate and the waiter ruined my night. He slammed the plates, he spoke in a very rude tone, he rushed us, I dont get it. I was a waitress myself its much easier to be nice rather than someone with a nasty attitude."
Gabriela F.,"Henrico, VA",0,23,15,2.0,2/1/2015,"Came in on January 12 at about 9:00  to celebrate a birthday. Service started on the bad side. Could have been the server who started our table couldn't keep up but it really wasn't busy when we showed up! He disappeared for about 15 minutes came back with drinks and disappeared again for a wile, never came back!! a waitress then pick up our table and totally turned things around for us, she was very polite and did a great job suggesting desserts and drinks. Food was mediocre!!!! Had orange chicken, which was breading not much chicken!! Calamari was good but the sauces where nothing special and very little of it, which was fine the lemon that's served with it was perfect! Desserts where of-course delicious!"
Karla R.,"Henrico, VA",0,2,,5.0,2/14/2016,Great place I love it.  The staff is very friendly.  We went today and it was packed we still had a great time.  Food is great.
Brett B.,"Maidens, VA",2,45,9,5.0,11/6/2014,Great menu great service.  Lots of choices. Wait staff very professuonal.  Got the big burrito and it was big and tasty.  It is usually packed and is a great location next to short pump mall. Recommend without reservation.
Julie G.,"Williamsburg, VA",0,6,5,5.0,1/7/2016,Happy hour menu is excellent. The value is great. Enjoy every time. Definitely come back again.
Taylor B.,"Henrico, VA",1,10,1,2.0,1/3/2017,"I decided to take my grandmother here as a treat. The wait was a little long, but it wasn't bad. However, my meal was not good and definitely not worth $20. I ordered the Fettuccine Alfredo with shrimp. We let the waitress know we were in a bit of a time crunch. The food didn't take long to get to the table, but unfortunately, my order was wrong. I received the angel hair pasta with tomato sauce instead. Given my dietary restrictions, I knew for sure this wasn't what I ordered. I immediately let the waitress know. She apologized and fixed my order, which took another 20 minutes. I received my food and honestly wished I had ordered something else. The pasta was dry, and the shrimp were tough and had a weird consistency. I tried to be a good sport knowing the restaurant was very busy. The only good thing about our visit was the cheesecake and the kind waitress. My grandmother being the kind of person she is wouldn't allow me to pay. I now feel guilty for recommending the place. It was not worth the price. Though we were in a hurry, I regret not speaking with the manager. I would recommend this place for dessert only."
Rebecca R.,"Huntington, WV",1,11,2,2.0,4/16/2016,"Thank goodness I'm a big fan of The Cheesecake Factory or I wouldn't go back based on this experience. The food wasn't bad. We ordered loaded tater tots. They aren't tater tots...they're a deep fried potato, cheese and bacon mixture covered in batter. Ok...but not what I expected.  I had the Chicken and Mushroom Lettuce Tacos. Not nearly enough ""filler"" for the lettuce. My husband had the Chicken Depana. Except for it being a little cool, he liked it! The cheesecake was the BEST part!! The service was just ok. We were there for a late dinner.  A party of 11 was seated next to us...in a spot meant for 8. They crowded into our dining space. We were seated on the ""bench seating"" area. Two more people came in and the waitress (who was also our waitress) pulled up chairs for them. I wish a Fire Marshall would have been there. We had to wait for most everything because the waitress was running back and forth for the ""party"". No apology. I hope her tip was worth it. We should have given them our bill. :/ We'll go to Dave and Buster's next time."
Dianne L.,"Richmond, VA",10,13,,1.0,7/16/2016,"Today for lunch I got a mixed greens salad called French Country on the appetizer list with beets, candied pecans, grilled asparagus and goat cheese with a vinaigrette dressing. Well, there might have been 2 beets in the whole salad, 2 little asparagus stems, not grilled, a dab of goat cheese compared to the amount of greens. They had it tossed in too much vinaigrette, which had too much garlic. The waitress was kind enough to bring more goat cheese to the table. My partner got Renee's Special. The sandwich was ok, turkey and avocado, but she was supposed to get a cup of soup, ended up being a bowl of potato soup, which was not very good, not many potatoes. The mixed greens for the side were on the same dish and it was more than I had. It also had that overwhelming vinaigrette dressing. Yuck! The menu said all sandwiches came with fries, but she was not given a choice with the special. There are too many great restaurants in Richmond to spend our money, not on a chain that was mediocre, at best. The place was packed, and we had to wait 15-20 minutes for a table, so people must like it, but not for us today."
Dale M.,"Henrico, VA",8,35,,2.0,5/30/2016,Horrible experience with our waiter.  He swore we ordered Cajun chicken when neither of us even like it. We asked for chicken fingers for my granddaughter.  He wouldn't let her order them as they are on the kids menu. He offered the Cajun chicken and we told him no that she would have maccoroni and cheese.  It took forever to get our food.
Penny K.,"Richmond, VA",0,8,,1.0,9/6/2016,"I called ahead for carry out and was told it would take 20-25 min to make my meal. Okay not problem. When I arrived at the curb side carry out parking about 10 min later I called (per website directions). I asked if they wanted to know what kind of car I was driving -- they've asked for it ever other time I've called for carry out. The person answering the phone responded, in a rude ton, ""make, model, color."" No yes, I need that--no nothing. Then told me it would be 25 min. I asked if that was in addition to the time I called in my order. She just said, ""oh, it's 25 min."" I called back and told the manager the type of service I'd received. Note, I've worked in food service and told the manager That as a supervisor I'd want to know. He just said, ""in the slow time of the year we only hire one person as cashier and to take carry out to the parking area--it might take awhile."" Well, he was right...45 min later I finally walked in to get my meal. It had now been 50-55 min since I called in an order I was told would take 20-25 min. Yep, there it was, sitting on the counter getting cold.  I waited while the cashier waits on someone else; when it was my turn I identified myself and asked if that was my meal. The cashier said it was. I asked if it had been sitting there awhile and her response was ""guess so."" I asked to talk to the manager. I asked him if he was the manager I had spoken to--he was. I told him that It had now been 50-55 min since I made my order and that my meal had obviously been sitting there for awhile. The manager, Rodney, said he could make me another meal (I declined, it was already late and I didn't want to wait another who knows how long). He asked what I thought he should do...I suggested he comp the now cold meal. He said he couldn't do that, but he'd check to see if the meal was edible--what was he going to do, take a bite out of it and give it back to me? I asked for his name and if he had a boss. I'll be calling the General Manager tomorrow morning. Food was okay, but the customer service was terrible! I won't be going back."
Worldhopping M.,"New York, NY",48,59,,2.0,7/24/2015,"Cheesecake factory decor and menu is nice and predictable. However, this particular location is good if you want to eat other people's chewed up food- all 10 of the utensils on our table and the plates we were provided were filthy. Really ames me question how clean it is behind the scenes if even the clean dishes are this disgusting!"
Dez T.,"Christiansburg, VA",11,20,9,2.0,1/25/2014,First off- we love the Cheesecake Factory and have been to several. This is hands down the worst experience we've had for service- food and overall experience.  The staff was unhelpful and rude.  The food was tasty however not to Cheesecake Factory standards at all. Did not appear to put any effort into food preparation.  We've eaten at the Cheesecake Factory in VA Beach since and had our faith restored but will not be wasting our time nor our money again at the Richmond location.
Olivia A.,"Fredericksburg, VA",0,22,14,4.0,9/27/2015,"The food here is always enough to take home for left overs, and always impeccable. The menu is so big I wish I could steer away from the Louisiana chicken pasta, but it's just too good to pass up on! The last time we went we also got a a crab and spinach dip and it was delicious. The only downfall I have eating here is that the tables are way too close for comfort. Being less than a foot away from two other tables isn't my cup of tea. I'd like to be able to stretch out my elbows and also not have to worry about what I'm saying or hearing the table next to us, they might as well have been part of our party."
Washington D.,"Richmond, VA",6,25,6,5.0,8/7/2015,My server Armani was great. The food was  delicious and the atmosphere was beautiful. Most definitely will be back!
Naba Q.,"Richmond, VA",1,5,,1.0,3/19/2015,"Absolutely worst service Iv had at a restaurant. The waiter was never around when needed, we had to keep asking for him. The appetizer platter we ordered was very oily and the salmon seemed undercooked, not very pleasant taste. We told the waiter we did not like it, the manger came and asked why we did not like the platter, and he seemed very upset and rude about the situation. I guess we should've just lied and said we liked it. The manager should of at least been much nicer about the situation. This was not during a busy time either!"
