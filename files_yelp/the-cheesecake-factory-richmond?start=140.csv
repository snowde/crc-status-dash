Anthony C.,"Glen Allen, VA",31,51,58,4.0,3/20/2012,"Yeah I know.. its a chain, but hey, most of the time the food is excellent.  I normally always get the Crispy Beef and sub the rice with mashed potatoes, but tonight I wanted to try something different, so I got the Over the Top Meatloaf sandwich.  It was covered with Swiss cheese, mushrooms and onions.  Had some unique spices to it.  Can on some thick Texas Toast bread.  It was pretty good.  The portion was HUGH... I could only eat one half of it. I normally really brag about there appetizers though.  I love their fire roasted Aritchoke... in my best Steve Stifler's voice from American Pie, ""It's Awwwwwesooome!""   We got some fried artichoke hearts last night that I shared with my 3 year old and we both liked them.  We wife got the Edamame and all of us liked sucking those soy beans out.  My 9 month old daughter even ate a few. I know there cheese cake is what they are known for, but we only really get it when we remember not to get appetizers and save some room.  The portions are always really big. Sometimes they can have a huge wait, Monday night we got premo seats without a wait.  Pretty kid friendly, our server even brought 2 little plates out with cut up bananas and some bread for our kids.   Never really have had bad service there, but they do overbook sections I think and getting you check sometimes can take an extra long time. Conclusion, We like the Factory.  Will go back again and again."
Brittany G.,"Emporia, VA",8,4,,4.0,9/25/2015,"Delicious food! Great portion of pasta, however, the portion of the meat could be a bit more generous for the price. The cheesecake is delicious, and from the one meal that I have had there, it is all well worth the price. The server was a bit blah, and it took a long time for our appetizer, which was just nachos (which were so-so). All in all, the main course and dessert was wonderful, the atmosphere was good, and I am a fan."
Chrissy D.,"Woodbridge, VA",6,60,12,4.0,10/17/2013,"I tend to grab a slice or some eats TOGO, can't say as I've had an issue w/that. Dining in is hit or miss, it can be great but expensive!! And sometimes the waits are rodonkulous. But mmmm the cakes (cheese & not) are pretty dang tasty (would deny ever even knowing of its existence should my trainer ask)."
Sarah S.,"Henrico, VA",6,207,,2.0,6/6/2015,"Eh... The decor is lovely. And that's it. Drinks tasted more meh then I remember. Food literally tasted worse then McD's. Desert was really off today. I could not tolerate to finish my cheesecake, it just wanted strange and wrong and it was literally painful to eat because of the weird taste / sensation. I can't describe it but it was bad. Everything was pricey as well.  Meh."
Cammy K.,"Midlothian, VA",28,44,22,2.0,9/19/2013,"First off, I was sick so dining out is uncomfortable and makes me grouchy. One thing, the place was FREEEZING. Like super cold, almost to the point of a walk-in cooler, that didn't help things.  I had a cocktail- the Sour Apple Martini and it tasted like liquid green jolly rancher. It was just fine with me since I'm a sugar fan and my sinuses were stopped up anyhow. The BF and I split the Pot Stickers- good sear on the dumplings and had decent filling, but WAY too much sesame oil in the sauce they were sitting in. Too much becomes overbearing like fish sauce. If they had a lighter hand, this would have been a super tasty app. I had the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp, a Thai-inspired dish over a scoop of rice. Had fantastic flavor, something I needed with my head cold, but the sauce was lacking. I'm spoiled by the dishes at Thai restaurant and I love extra sauce in my curry dishes where you need a spoon to get all the delicious flavors. Having a thinner sauce and more of it would have made it better. I took home a Vanilla Bean Cheescake. Meh. I ended up eating most of the custard on top as not being a fan of New York Style Cheesecake.  We went because we had a gift card, that's the only reason we'll go back."
Faye F.,"Toronto, Canada",283,742,80,4.0,11/9/2011,"I want to start by saying, I'm actually not a huge fan of cheesecake in general, but I liked the cheesecake factory. The portions are pretty large, we shared an app, and one entree, and a piece of cheesecake - the amount of food was perfect for 2 people.  If we had each ordered our own entrees that might be a bit different.  I don't think any one leaves the cheesecake factory hungry.... We had the Reese peanut butter cheesecake-  Yum, not too cheese-cakey, dynamite shrimp (app), and a shared platter with steak diana and herb-crusted salmon. there's often a line up - try to get there before mall closing time."
Nastassia M.,"Meridianville, AL",2,11,9,2.0,5/9/2015,"I usually frequent ""Cheesecake Factory"" in other areas, and decided to visit this location at Short Pump. After, ordering my usual meal with a medium steak, I noticed the portion to be different than those at my table. I requested them to correct the portion accurately. The waiter was extremely nice however, her manager Jen Anderson walked to my table and stated, "" if you want more you'll be charged additional""next time"", because I've personally weighed each meal. This was not the correct response as a manager, the concern should have been addressed with an apology and the meal portion should have been mitigated immediately."
Rachel B.,"Glen Allen, VA",7,20,8,1.0,8/15/2013,"Dirty table, dirty silverware and dirty floor. When I ask to have somebody to replace the silverware and wipe off the table a guy came over and wiped out the window seal which had dead bugs in it and then used the same towel to wipe my table with. When the manager came over at my request I ask why was this store in such dirty shape he told me that he had no excuse. I said If the front is this nasty what must the kitchen look like. He said nothing. We left. As a side note the booth we were sat at had rips in it with food stuck in it. A bad experience"
Keta B.,"Richmond, VA",51,109,64,4.0,1/4/2014,"It's always busy, so don't let the crowd scare You away.. But the food is always great too! This place is always a treat..the ambiance and decor are always great..along with the servers dressed in all white. It's easy to forget that this place is known for it's Cheesecake because of the menu that is overflowing with options! This particular day my group enjoyed several appetizers to share... But their Home Made meatloaf and Cobb salad are great as well. Oh and the Cheesecake is wonderful..but by the time the food is all gone, it's easy to forget that is an option! There is always  a bit of a wait because of the location, but it's worth it especially with a group of people.."
Ryan M.,"Midlothian, VA",97,121,5,1.0,9/20/2013,"Not a fan.   Perhaps I should come here exclusively for the desserts, but I'm not even that crazy about desserts.  Why do people go crazy over this place with the price tags these dishes have?   And why does their menu have to be 20 pages long, with FULL page advertisements in them.  Am I opening a ValuPak or am I opening a restaurant menu?  Come on. Tried the pot stickers, which were flavorful and moist as they should be, but the dish was totally killed by the oil it was floating in.  Definitely unnecessary, and salted the entire thing far too much.  Shame, because they could have saved face with a 2 star rating instead of a 1.  Because my opinion matters, or something. Went with their Carbonara pasta, and opted to have the spaghettini replaced with penne.  I think that substitute was a good move, but the entire dish was totally off kilter.  The sauce was the consistency of water.  The ""sauce"" was STARTING to get the flavor to where it should have been, but just fell short. Sorry, but 80$ for an appetizer, a couple drinks and a couple entrees for sub-par food is a joke."
Brian B.,"Chicago, IL",702,82,,3.0,5/19/2015,"Oh Cheesecake Factory how I loathe when my girlfriend convinces me to eat at your establishment.  Your food is overpriced and not that great.  It's obvious that you're a cheesecake place that serves food just to get people in the door to pay $7 for a slice of cheesecake.  Your cheesecake is good, sometimes great.  But everything else... it's obvious it's just thrown together to get people in there to buy cheesecake."
Diana M.,"Henrico, VA",0,2,,2.0,10/31/2014,I wonder if the owners ever read these reviews?  They certainly don't pay attention if they do.  We didn't have a problem with service or food but dirty bread plates?   It's as if they don't care to check if what they put out is clean.  The floor under our table was covered in food and trash and all around the dining room it was noticeably dirty.  Leaves one to wonder about the cleanliness of the kitchen?  I expect more from a what I thought was a top shelf restaurant.  I know it can be busy but the restaurant was not as it was early 3:30 on a Friday.  A time most would be preparing for dinner service maybe I just watch to much Hells Kitchen!
Joshua R.,"Henrico, VA",0,1,,1.0,9/26/2015,"I truly and honestly hate writing negative feedback on establishments. However, at this point I have no choice. I dined with a friend on 9/24, ordered the gumbo which at the moment tasted fine (I guess it would with all the sauce and spices). By 5am I'm rushing to the rest room to vomit. And that's when it starts my entire day of 9/25 was vomiting and ultimately leaving work to go to the doctors to discover I had food poisoning. It's something I've never experienced before but I do know with proper inspections, safety precautions a customer should never experience this. I'm in awe that this even happened to me and surprised myself that this is the only form of action I've taken, was this review. As you can imagine I will never again eat at this establishment."
Christopher C.,"Chester, VA",12,9,2,1.0,10/8/2013,"My wife had a $50 gift card to The Cheescake Factory, so we decided to eat there on one our rare nights out without the kids. We arrived at about 7:30pm on a Friday and the first thing I noticed was that it was loud.  The place is built like a big box and it seemed like everyone was yelling to be heard over everyone else.   I asked if we could be seated outside, but the waitress said since there were thunderstorms in the area that the outside patio had been closed and it wasn't possible.  So she lead our party of 2 through the restaurant, and I saw where she was leading us and started to pray that we weren't going to be seated where I thought she was going to seat us.  If you've ever seen speed dating on television, you've probably seen the small tables for 2 that we were led to.  This table wasn't against the wall but in the middle of a row of about 12-15 of these tables.   When we sat down I could better hear (and probably touch) the guys to either side of me than I could my wife across the table.  Then I heard kids crying, people yelling, and a goat bleating (not really) and hollered to my wife that our ""date nights"" are too rare to get hoarse trying to hold a conversation and that I wanted to leave. We left and ate at Capitol Ale House further east on Broad Street at Innsbrook.   I'll update my review one day when we go at an off-peak hour to use up that gift card. The main gist of this review is if you want to be able to hold a conversation without yelling, best avoid this place at 7:30 pm on Friday night."
Nancy K.,"Manakin-Sabot, VA",0,3,,3.0,7/7/2015,"Love this place, but NEVER EVER EVER order the eggplant Parmesan. It did not taste fresh. The crust was so hard I had to use a knife to cut through it. I could not taste eggplant. The pasta had so much oil on it the when you lifted it up it dripped off. It was absolutely gross. Our waiter was nice, but not available to send the food back. Everyone else in my party had normally good food that we have grown to expect."
Trusty T.,"Punta Gorda, FL",0,14,,1.0,6/28/2015,"Salad dressing was a cup of MAYO!! Soup was a bowl of yellow creamy stuff with a couple of corn kernels sunk to the bottom. Bread on sandwich was so hard you couldn't cut it with a knife. Benches had fake padding (please don't plop down on it!). My husband got a stomach ache afterwards and I instantly lost all my energy the rest of the day (a sure sign I had eaten something unhealthy). We usually enjoy our dates. This one? Horrible. I was so upset we'd spent our money on something so ridiculously bad.  If it weren't for the name, the decor, and the overpriced cheesecake, they'd have gone belly up a long time ago."
Art R.,"Rice, VA",16,82,18,3.0,2/18/2015,It was very busy we waited 40 min to be seated that was ok b/c they said it was going to be 30 to 40 min the food was ok the price was high 180.00 for 4 people 2 mixed drinks at 11.00 each no drink prices on menu the meal size was on the smaller size and the steaks were small for the price (12 Oz rib eye 26.00) the cheesecake  was the best part
Austin A.,"Midlothian, VA",0,2,,5.0,7/1/2015,"After reading so many negative reviews on here, my expectations were fairly low, so I was pleasantly surprised that my group had a great experience!  We were seated very quickly and had the pleasure of being seated in a booth.  I can certainly see why people would complain about the stand alone tables being too close together, because they are so close that everyone is practically eating together, so fortunately we avoided that! Our waitress was very attentive and always seemed to be around to refresh drink, but was not overbearing at all and was very professional.   The food was also much better than I expected.  We ordered calamari as an appetizer and were impressed.  It certainly was not the best calamari I have ever had, but it had good texture and flavor, and I would definitely recommend it.  The couple we were with ordered the spinach dip which they said was definitely below average, it was basically boiled spinach with little shredded cheese thrown on top. Our entrees were all VERY large(which I think is a plus), and came out very quickly.  We had the Louisiana chicken pasta, the tomato basil penne, Cajun style catfish, and the fried shrimp, all of which exceeded our expectations. Of course we finished off with cheesecake.  The vanilla bean cheesecake was fantastic, as was the oreo.  Both are a tad pricey(as expected) but the large portion sizes made up for it. Although I went in trying not to like the place,  I think our whole party left very satisfied with the meal."
Mary H.,"Henrico, VA",0,7,,3.0,8/14/2016,"I really want to like Cheesecake Factory, since I have a huge sweet tooth and there is no denying that they do cheesecake well. But every visit to the restaurant is disappointing, to the point of we just try it once a year. This year's visit was just depressing. We arrived for a late lunch on a weekday. The restaurant was maybe 25% full. The hostess tries to squeeze us into a two-top next to a large party with very young children. I ask politely if we can have a table with more space. Huge sigh and eye roll from hostess and she does not even speak, just flounces off with the menus. We follow hoping she is in fact re-seating us. We are seated at a more appropriate table. From there the service is fine, but we are struck by the fact that NO ONE SMILED at us the entire time we were there. Not the hostess, not the waiter, not the food runners-NO ONE. It was just odd. No one was outright rude, and the food came promptly, which we were certainly appreciative of, but it kind of freaked us out that not one employee seemed happy to be working there. When I want cheesecake I might get takeout from this location, but I don't think we will be dining here again."
Navia G.,"Richmond, VA",29,150,33,4.0,7/31/2013,"Be prepared to wait if you're here to dine during peak hours.  This is a great CF location. Service is usually good here, food quality is great, and the restaurant is always really clean. I usually prefer to stick to my local RVA haunts, but this place's dining room is so big that sometimes it just makes sense to arrange a group dinner here. Almost everything I've had here is great, except for the fish tacos. Don't waste your money on those."
