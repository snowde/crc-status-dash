Sam S.,"Manakin-Sabot, VA",3,46,35,3.0,12/21/2014,I always ask myself why I put myself through this after I eat at The Cheesecake Factory. The food is good and the portions are more than fair but 60-90 minutes for a wait and they're proud of their food too; don't believe me? Check out their prices.
Liz C.,"Manakin-Sabot, VA",0,5,,2.0,4/24/2015,"Hadn't been to CF in a long while and was shocked at the prices. The unrealistic portion sizes are supposed to compensate for the prices, I guess, but it's really wasting food unless you want to eat leftovers at home the next day.  We had the meatloaf with mashed potatoes and what was described as succotash. My meatloaf had a stack of cooked stringy onions on the top, while my companion's had both onions and mushrooms. The meat was overly spicy, a bit too much pepper, and was slightly on the dry side, no gravy or sauce included. The mashed potatoes were redskin and included a lot of lumps, tasted fine though. The ""succotash"" wasn't really what we Southerners define as succotash, i.e. corn and lima beans, often with tomatoes. It was grilled corn, sweet peppers, onions and, again, something very spicy added. It was good, just not succotash.  The restaurant was virtually empty at 2:30 pm on a Friday. The service was very good, except the oddity of my companion's water glass being refilled while my tea glass sat there half-filled. In an hour and a half, the tea glass was never refilled....and at $2.95 for it, that was not good. Add to that the tea being VERY weak and tasteless, and this restaurant lost another star.   We had no cheesecake. After the prices of the meal, there was nothing left for dessert at an overpriced restaurant that we will likely never revisit."
Bubba N.,"Helena, MT",1,237,,1.0,4/22/2015,"We went on a Sunday afternoon and it was busy. So I got a piece of original cheesecake and a slice of carrot cake. For over $16 for the two.  The cheesecake almost had a bad pudding consistency, the topping had a weird sour flavored topping.  And it was SMALL!  The carrot cake was dry, and wasn't even a full piece.  Almost like someone cut one piece on a bad angle.  I'm assuming the frosting was an attempt at a cream cheese flavor, but was a cheap imitation. I have ate at other CF's and had amazing desserts, but this was horrible. I will most likely never go back to one after this. And to top it off, the cashier for the takeout area made a loud sigh when she looked at the receipt and I didn't tip. Why would I tip at a two minute carry out stop?"
Garmboyz J.,"Midlothian, VA",14,1,,1.0,2/18/2015,"My wife called to place the order and ask me to pick it up on my way home from work. Got there, said i'm here for a pick up under name Jack. She asked me what i ordered and i said i'm not sure because my wife called but i'm sure there's gotta a miso salmon in the order 'cause that's what i always get. Apparently she gave me someone's else order that has the miso salmon in there. Got home and didn't realize that they gave me the wrong order. Wife called back and explain it the manager. This is what he said "" ITS NOT OUR GIRL'S FAULT BECAUSE YOUR HUSBAND DIDN'T CONFIRM THE ORDER "". So i had to got back there again, the girl who gave me the wrong order and manager was there as well and none of them said anything to me. So it was my friggin' fault right ?!?!? i'm the one should be saying i'm sorry ?!?!?. Well, as a restaurant owner/server/manager. I'm speechless !!!"
Louci T.,"Chester, VA",16,4,,2.0,3/21/2016,"The Cheesecake was GREAT.  However the rest of it was only so-so and for the drive and the price - not worth it at all.  So if you are at the mall and you want a great dessert - go there, otherwise hit up one of the other bazillion places in Short Pump.."
Andy G.,"Virginia Beach, VA",58,256,10,4.0,7/18/2013,Everything is always good here.
Andrew W.,"San Antonio, TX",0,71,4,2.0,11/26/2011,"Server was wa wa waaaaaa.   She didn't have any suggestions, apparently she's never eaten here. She was out of silverware so he dumped a pile of forks on the table with some napkins.  Took awhile to take our order and it took awhile to get our order.  Ahi tartare was pretty good, nothing to rave about. Chicken Marsala was good, friend had the lunch portion of the chicken carbona and said it was decent.  The winner was the Americana burger, looked delicious and got a good review. We also heard about the fried Mac and cheese burger, but this was from another server.  Ours wouldn't dare go into details about the food.  Pineapple upside cheesecake was good.  Overall, the food was slightly below average cheesecake factory and the waitress was just plain awkward.  Some of the worst service I've ever gotten."
Eris J.,"Henrico, VA",0,3,,1.0,6/1/2014,"Worst experience ever! Ive been dining here for years and things seemed to have changed. We had the fried macaroni and cheese - tasted great! It was all good until we had the lunch carbonara,  my favorite dish from Cheesecake Factory.  Yuck! It was so incredibly bland, frozen Kroger brand pasta would have tasted better. The worst part of it all was when we told the manager,  she had a bad attitude and was very reluctant to provide any restitution. Luckily our great waitress got us a refund. We left her a note, detailing our issues.  Hope she read it. Won't be back."
Renee L.,"Henrico, VA",3,16,,4.0,6/12/2014,"Food was great, and it's not nearly expensive like most people think it is, decent service."
Judith L.,"Atlanta, GA",202,470,84,3.0,10/22/2012,"I wouldn't go so far as to say that I am a fan of the Cheesecake Factory, but at the same time, I don't dislike the place. Their menu is huge. Like, sit down and read a novel big. From appetizers and small plates to tons of entrees, and then don't forget the namesake: cheesecake. It's one of those places that you can be sure everyone in your party will be able to find something that they like (or would be willing to eat). Ended up ordering a ton. We had a $50 gift card and no intention of heading back over here any time soon. Ordered the Buffalo Blasts and they were delicious. Chicken, cheese, and buffalo sauce friend and served with blue cheese dressing. They were crispy, slightly spicy, and the chicken was tender. Also got the Vietnamese shrimp summer rolls, which I would probably skip. Although the veggies (asparagus, mushrooms, carrots) were fresh, the shrimp and rice paper just didn't do it for me. Got the shepherd's pie as well, which was a ton of beef, veggies (mushrooms, carrots, peas, onions) drenched in sauce and topped with a mashed potatoes that had a thin cheese crust over top of them. Not my thing, but it wasn't bad. And the serving was huge. Got the fried shrimp platter, too. Cole slaw was too mayo-y, but the shrimp were large and tasted good. Fries were fries. We were way too full for dessert, even to take home. But trust me when I say you probably won't regret ordering dessert. Their selection of cheesecakes is huge. I remember liking a red velvet one in the past. Overall, slightly on the pricier side but the portions and selection make it a fair choice."
S A.,"Richmond, VA",0,4,,1.0,7/22/2016,"We love Cheesecake Factory first of all and frequent this location. However, we won't be returning to this location unless management changes. My sister, husband and I went out for a celebration tonight and left feeling frustrated and disrespected. Our waitress was sweet and attentive, and deserves a 5 star raving review. Unfortunately, my sister's meal came out and it was inedible and tasted like eating straight balsamic vinegar. We asked the waitress about it and she agreed that it didn't smell or look correct, and made the situation right by bringing out a completely different dish. She also commented that she spoke to the manager and the manager would comp her meal, which we expected to mean that my sister's portion of the bill would be taken off. Then when we got the bill we were charged for her meal. They ""comped"" her meal she sent back (which is not a comp-- of course she shouldn't have to pay for a meal that was sent back) and charged us for her replacement meal. I politely asked to speak with the manager, thinking surely something was typed incorrectly on our receipts. Normally this isn't something I would do, but I truly thought that there may have been a mistake on the bill. Instead of listening respectfully and trying to understand our situation, the manager was incredibly rude and demeaning and made us feel stupid for thinking our meal would be comped. He immediately said ""why would I comp that meal?"" in a sarcastic and mean tone, then after asking why my sister didn't like the meal, coldly said ""that's how the meal was supposed to taste, sorry you didn't like it. We comped the meal you sent back and got you a new one."" After this argument continued going back and forth with continued rudeness on his end, I finally said to forget it, apparently we didn't understand each other. All he said was ""great"" and walked away. He saw my frustration and was fine with leaving the situation dealt with in this poor manner, with a completely dissatisfied customer. I was not expecting to be treated this way at all. This manager  clearly does not value his customers and, despite the fact that our food ended up tasting good in the end and our waitress was phenomenal, the unnacceptable way that he treated us in the end has made it so none of us will be returning to this restaurant location again."
Beercan B.,"Manakin-Sabot, VA",2,26,,4.0,8/8/2012,"""Hunger is black, like a deep hole in the middle of nowhere.""   The 'Kings Dominion' of restaurants get's a normally good review but that's because there's a vocal minority that enjoys sitting for 45 minutes waiting to pay $29 for spaghetti.  I, for one, decided to cave in to the hype and try this glutton for bowel punishment for myself.   The menu was written by Tolstoy, and as he once said: ""It is amazing how complete is the delusion that beauty is goodness.""  They can put makeup on a pig, but it's still a pig.  This place looks like it should be a rich man's Cheddars, but it's more like a Applebee's whore cousin. If you can, sit at the bar...the 'view' is much better, guys and bearded clam-lovers...wink wink, nod nod. Anywho, I had the sirloin and mushrooms and it was actually pretty good..not as good as the cigarette odor that accompanied my dish by the person who brought it to me but after 5 minutes it drifted away.  The dish was cooked perfectly and the mix of mushrooms/beef took me on a journey of delights known only by those who probably huff sasquatch farts.  Sweet surrender that steak is tender!  I actually tried to get the small lunch crowd to begin this chant, but to no avail..apparently, they were too busy their lives...you know the type, a bunch of Obama voters. For dessert, I sampled the sweetest piece of cheesecake known to this universe...I didn't, however, like the judgmental look I got when I requested a chocolate milk to go with it.  Go for the experience, stay for the price..no, really...sit for awhile because you're paying too much for this."
Octavia R.,"Chester, VA",0,10,3,1.0,11/7/2014,"Came here to celebrate a friend's birthday. We got the worst service I've experienced in quite some time. Waitress failed to provide refills, even when asked. She failed to answer questions and did not acknowledge us or ask the typical ""is everything ok"" questions. When I told her our bread came out cold, she said ""all the bread is cold"". The food was mediocre. Talked to the manager and did not even receive an ""I apologize that your experience has not been pleasing"". Just an ""ok"" as though the deficiencies were acceptable. We will NOT return to this restaurant again and if you're looking for good food and service, you should continue looking because Cheesecake Factory Richmond isn't it."
Leila A.,"Fredericksburg, VA",0,11,,2.0,7/1/2016,"Normally LOVE The Cheesecake Factory. Went to this location during the day Sun June 26. Chicken Parm sub was just gross. It was like a grease patty on a hard sub roll & not enough marinara to cover it. The hubby wouldn't eat it either. I let management know & they deducted it from my bill, which was nice. I finished my water while hubby ate his Cuban, which I had suggested. It didn't taste wonderful like it usually does but he was hungry so he ate it. I waited and waited for the waitress to come back to refill my water. While I was waiting, I started stirring my ice around and was getting ready to chew on some when I realized there was a dead fly in my glass. At that point, all I could do was laugh. I let the manager know about my ""fly water"" too. He offered a piece of free cheesecake. At that point, there was no way I was eating anything else from that restaurant. I would've given it a 1 but gave the rating of 2 since the hubby ate his."
Xida Z.,"New York, NY",244,289,431,3.0,12/22/2012,"Choose carefully, dining experience really depends on what you get The Cheesecake Factory is so American. The portions are huge. The food tastes  good and isn't good for you. You can choose your own adventure. Is it going to be Chinese, French, or Southern food tonight? No wonder the decor is purposefully and indistinguishably generic.  I've had the fish tacos, light and quite good, and the California omelette, made of no less than five eggs. The appetizers are consistently very tasty though. It might be worthwhile to get apps and skip dinner to dessert. Prices are ok for the size of portions.  Ambiance and Service 3/5 Food 3/5 Value 3/5"
Dominic B.,"Richmond, VA",4999,1019,663,4.0,5/18/2012,"I love the Cheesecake Factory in Short Pump.When I come to the Cheesecake Factory, I want to skip right to dessert.Sometimes, I get cheesecake to go because the restaurant has a cheesecake to go section.The Cheesecake Factory offers the best cheesecake in Richmond.The slices are a bit pricey(around $7) but it's worth the dollars.The snickers & white chocolate macadamia cheesecake is delicious.The food is really good and I like the salads.The menu is a book.It takes at least 15 minutes or more to look over the entire menu.The bar area is small. The atmosphere is really nice and social. On packed weekends the restaurant can be loud. Cheesecake Factory has a small waiting area inside.On nice days you can wait outside of the restaurant .The service is usually good unless it's really crowded.Fridays & Saturdays can become very busy.You will experience very long wait times, so getting in early is a smart choice.Whenever you visit the Cheesecake Factory,leave room for dessert!"
Aluanna F.,"Jacksonville, NC",1,60,5,4.0,4/19/2014,"Quality food and service! We ordered the Grilled Chicken Lettuce wraps Mexican Style! Amazing and very well presented. Also the Buffalo Chicken Wings are divine! Must try! The pizza was so-so. Overall loved it, will be craving it for sure. Only had a 15 minute wait considering how busy it was!"
Linda M.,"Woodbridge, VA",0,4,1,1.0,11/10/2015,"Everything started off great until it took 45 mins to an hour to get our food. The waitress Sayla then apologized for the long wait  and asked if we wanted to talk to a manger. All the manager did was give two people of my 6 people party new dishes no real apology. Once the rest of the tables food came out - one entree noddles was over cooked, another didn't get chicken which she specifically asked for as well as mushrooms and another was given a completely wrong entree. One we notice the new errors we then told the waitress and she took the plate back with an attitude. Completely unacceptable! Meanwhile Sayla never came back to our table and we were greeted by a new waitress who finished serving our table. A manager never came back to make sure everything was ok either. Just a totally bad experience. I will never visit this short pump Cheesecake Factory. We were only in town for a night for a company conference but I would not recommend this location to anyone during our next conference!"
John M.,"Henrico, VA",115,100,85,3.0,12/5/2012,"The Cheesecake Factory portion sizes explain why Americans are fat.  That's not to say that the food is not delicious.  When I'm trying to be healthy, I can always find something that is both delicious and healthy.  The last time I was there was for a business lunch.  The brown bread that is served at the beginning of lunch is quite tasty.  The menu is huge, so plan to spend 5 or 10 minutes just making it through the many items.  Be prepared to take home leftovers. And don't forget that you can get a slice of cheesecake to go!"
Luvie B.,"Brooklyn, NY",12,31,,4.0,2/17/2014,"We came here late sunday night just looking for snacks since we ate dinner earlier.The floors were VERY slippy,star away for that.My SO slipped in fancy combat boots.Anyway the food was really yummy especially the lemon raspberry cheesecake.Our waiter Jeff was a true pleasure.He was super personable and bubbly.He even snagged the last slice of that yummy cheesecake for us early..what a guy!I will return to try other flavors when I'm having another fatty moment."
