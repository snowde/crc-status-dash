David K.,"Dublin, VA",0,14,4,3.0,10/17/2015,"I ordered the dinner Orange Chicken with brown rice on Friday evening. I requested additional glaze when I ordered. The meal tasted delicious, but was not nearly as warm as i would expect a $45 meal for two to be. I had to ask again for the extra glaze and did not receive it until halfway through my meal. The taste was there, but the temperature of the meal was clearly substandard, especially for a meal of this caliber."
Jessica H.,"Hyde Park, MA",313,300,1194,4.0,1/23/2012,"My step mom and I went shopping at Short Pump the day after Christmas to hit up all the sales.  After wards I treated her to lunch since she likes to come here with my dad usually after a day of shopping.  I have only been here one other time with my dad - a few years ago.  I love the new Skinnylicious menu! It is much more vegetarian/vegan friendly.  I am so happy to see alcoholic drinks and also food that are under 550 calories.  The regular menu was always impressive but it actually wasn't that vegan friendly. Typically in the past I would get the lettuce wraps but replace the chicken with portobello slices (yummy!).  This time I got a Bloody Mary to drink (almost got a Sangria - I was torn), my step mom got a beer.  For lunch I got the grilled asparagus but skipped the aioli dip and instead got olive oil.  I also got the new mushroom lettuce wrap. My step mom got the polenta (corn cakes) and a salad.  We enjoyed everything. It was crazy crowded so we sat at the bar. The best part about the experience was not the food but the service. The bartender was this sweetheart young woman from Brazil (?) who my step mom remembered from previous dining experiences there. She was really sweet and helpful. The whole staff seemed to be very pleasant - I remember this from my other time there with my dad.  Oh Virginia I miss your southern hospitality. I wish they'd have a few more vegan options but they have come along way with this new menu!  One day I hope they will offer a vegan cheesecake!"
Jose R.,"Richmond, VA",0,14,,2.0,2/5/2015,"Unfortuantely the last few times i visited this location the food was Sub-par and that's being kind. My steak tasted as if it had been nuked. Our Calamari was horrible, could not even finish our meal. We left this branch five mins after receiving our meal. Full plates left right on the table. Happily paid to leave our disappointment sitting on the table. Walked over to Maggiano's to make up for our experience at this location."
Lacey D.,"Chesterfield, VA",1,13,4,3.0,6/24/2015,"Usually this place is awesome, but I went there last night with my gal friend and she ordered the Four Cheese pasta and I ordered the Tex Mex Eggrolls. Well this morning I woke up at like 5 am and my stomach was KILLING ME, well all I could do was make it to the toilet. It was coming out both ends. I texted my friend and told her that The Cheesecake Factory gave me food poisoning and she said she was feeling sick too and didn't know what she ate, but since she ate only half of one eggroll it didn't make her as sick as it made me. Not a good experience this time. We had a waiter named Jefferey he was very nice though."
Mona F.,"Glen Allen, VA",0,4,,1.0,1/18/2014,"The order began with appetizers.   Crab wontons, while the  crab wontons tasted good, it was clear that there was more cream cheese than crab so I would not define these as crab wontons however, that does not mean that some would not find this tasty.   I usually cringe when seeing 1 star ratings on yelp, but when it comes to food, it becomes a serious matter and one of note. Let's get to it,  the Miso salmon, tasted good and I finished it,  but shortly after eating this salmon my stomach began to hurt or feel upset, little did I know that I would become sick and had DIARRHEA the entire afternoon(we ordered food around 1:45pm), and unable to eat anything else after this yesterday, after surviving yesterday's ordeal I wrote this review.  This salmon was apparently not fresh so I would rate this dish for 1/17/2014 (Friday) as disgusting.    I have been to different cheese cake factories and find that this to be my least favorite of the ones that I have been to as apparently this is not as clean as the others (utensils and now some food). I have been to this one on a few occasions previously.  I cannot stress this enough, it is important when handling meat that all areas are clean and that the meat is not going bad. I know because I cook.  What impacted the customer experience  was that I was treated by a friend who felt awful seeing me sick.  The waitress was at best indifferent toward the end."
Steven A.,"Virginia Beach, VA",179,417,47,3.0,8/24/2011,"This chain has an evil, corporate soul.  It is the stereotype for all things that are wrong in the restaurant world.  A 450 page menu...very little (if anything) prepared fresh by talented people.  Cheery but mostly inefficient servers.  You get my drift. BUT!  I was at the Short Pump Mall over the weekend on a back to school shopping trip for our little cherub.  Shop after shop after shop.  I wanted to open a vein just to interupt the monotony. Just when I am in the process of exhausting my last ounce of sanity...there it was.  The magical word ""Bar"" at the end of the Cheesecake Factory sign.   In the immortal words of Kim Jong-Il, I needed a ""compricated pran."" I offered to carry the armload of bags back to the car that was parked (heh heh) waaaaaaaaay far away.  My wife tensed for just a split second before relenting to my kind, generous offer.  Her eyes narrowed as I turned and walked away, trying to hide that little extra giddy-up in my step. I was on my second dirty bombay sapphire martini when I got busted.  She must have tracked my cell phone with her ESP (Estrogen Sensory Perception).  Or maybe I am just too predictable.  But anyhow I was restored...just in time for the inevitable Crate & Barrel walk through."
Ann N.,"Manhattan, NY",0,16,1,3.0,11/4/2013,"This place is always cold, and has a long wait. But I keep going back bc Cheesecake Factory has the best guacamole and cheesecake, of course!"
Lisa G.,"Richmond, VA",423,1581,592,3.0,12/12/2011,"See one, seen 'em all.  It's a chain. A place to go when you can't think of anywhere more interesting to try.  Nothing special, and the menu is way too big, though the cheesecake, of course, is to die for."
S W.,"Christiansburg, VA",0,99,47,3.0,4/3/2015,Server was friendly and kept drinks filled. Bread basket was lackluster.  Butter was too hard to spread on it. Daughter's pasta dish was dry and we requested a bowl of extra sauce.  Huge portion and shared with her friend.  Teriyaki chicken with rice was delicious.  The rice was just okay without any sauce on it.  The table split a red velvet cake. Cake was good but not enough cake. It had too much cheesecake filling. Nice decor. Women's bathroom could use some attention.  A special occasion place but not cost effective for a family with young children.
Ken K.,"Longs, SC",2,25,12,4.0,7/24/2013,"Our daughter's 14th birthday was celebrated here! She always loved this place even as a little girl so we try to find one everywhere we go! The food and service is always consistantly great and she loves to shop at these malls (seems this place is always located at a very nice location,ie Vegas, Charlotte,etc). Just remember parking at these places can be frustrating and the wait could seem like an eternity!"
Dorsi S.,"Duncan, SC",55,2,20,5.0,3/15/2012,Loved it great atmosphere waited an hour for a table and it was worth every minute the waitress went out of her way to make us comfortable and she was very upbeat and bubbly awesome experience and of course the cheesecake was amazing. There's a bug selection to choose from.
Holly C.,"Seattle, WA",9,108,14,5.0,5/17/2011,"I love going here...it's delicious! The price is right, the food portions are HUGE, and the servers are always excellent :) Also, brunch is amazing!"
Bethany F.,"Richmond, VA",135,38,80,1.0,1/1/2013,"Ah, the mother of all chain restaurants nestled into a corner of the exquisite and refined Short Pump mall.   Get a preview of the patrons who dine here (and likely sitting next to) as you try to angrily wrangle a parking spot in the miniscule parking lot.   Come inside to wait 30 minutes for gluttonous over-sized portions that'll cost you more than a trip to the gym.  Diners here here are hungry and just got done blowing plastic at the mall.  I've never experienced so many people (during one sitting) complaining to management to get free food.  I was a waitress for 3 years, I know how it works (and looks like)."
Eric C.,"Richmond, VA",35,64,29,4.0,10/22/2011,The location of the place is in a good spot. There were some good days and bad days at this location. It was mainly good days but the last one was a bad one. I'm the type that likes to stick with what I like. I usually get the hibachi steak or the burrito (don't remember the name but it's the big burrito). The hibachi seak is my favorite dish there. I've had different types of pastas there and nothing really special. I remember I had a flavored lemonade some time ago and it was extremely sour. It was proably the worst lemonade I ever had... The parking kinda sucks because it's a mall and it's usually packed and you have to park really far.  All in all...it's good but I wouldn't come here if I was on a vacay and saw it in another state. akatek1
blain t.,"Richmond, VA",3,75,18,4.0,1/10/2011,"I know it is a cookie cutter chain restaurant, but their food has always been pretty good for me. This is in a nice spot, and you can go wander around the mall a bit if the wait is too long (it usually is.) The food is consistently good, and there is always a TON of it.  If I want to make it to dessert I have to stop eating halfway through my meal otherwise I'm too full.  And just forget about it if anyone orders an appetizer. Good for groups, kids, everyone. We've been three times and we've always had very attentive and great service as well."
Nina H.,"Johnson City, TN",48,67,,3.0,8/13/2013,"Insanely large menu that is sure to please everyone in the family. But as usual, if you try and please everyone, you usually don't please anyone. Food is average, but satisfying. New skinnylicious menu is a step in the right direction...something to balance out the 1000calorie piece of cheesecake!"
Sean C.,"Richmond, VA",62,278,378,3.0,6/10/2010,"Dropped in for a quick snack around happy hour so we decided to sit down in the bar area and sample the Happy Hour Bar Menu.  For 5 bucks a plate we had some great sliders and decent Nachos.  The Nachos had two types of cheese and came with Guac, Sour Cream and Fresh Salsa....the plate was huge.  They were worth $5.  The 4 sliders were also fresh, the rolls were soft and tasty and the meat had a char grilled taste with a hint of pickle.  We each had a draft and were out the door for $16.00!"
M B.,"Boca Raton, FL",71,231,7,4.0,9/13/2010,"This Cheesecake location is lovely! It's right next to/in Shortpump Mall which is fabulous. I have come here several times, each of them being a positive experience.  The food, as usual at the Cheesecake Factory, has always been delicious. I came in on a Saturday afternoon with two friends and we were seated in the section of a really nice waitress, who was very patient with us through our chatting which delayed the ordering process haha. She must have come back three times and we were still talking about our personal lives. The service was a little slow, but that could be because it was the Saturday lunch rush. She split the check for us without even asking, too.  I'd come back!"
sherri s.,"Newtown, PA",29,261,24,1.0,6/26/2012,"Okay so last time I was here I raved about my meal, service and great dining experience...but this time...not good.  Cheesecake Factory is usually a great place...in every city!  But this time I sat at the bar and wow...the Bartender really ruined it for me.  She took way too long to get to me...but I was a good sport and waited patiently...once I got my meal,  she never checked on me, she forgot my water, never asked to refill my wine, she was not pleasant, and she would not add a gift card to my check.  My small salad was saturated in dressing, way too many chunks of tomatoes, and not enough lettuce!  I still like CF...but really...tonight was not good."
Lisa N.,"Fairfax, VA",598,464,908,3.0,4/15/2012,"The only thing I come here for is the happy hour! From 4-6PM M-F (please check times depending on the location), appetizers and specialty cocktails are only $5!  I suggest getting the J.R.'s Pink Lemonade, Mojito, Taquitos, Fried Mac&Cheese, Calamari, Fried Crab Wontons, and Potstickers.  However, you have to sit in the bar area (which can be really really crowded, especially on Thursday and Friday so get there early.  Besides the HH, CF is nothing special.  It can be overpriced, overcrowded, and service can be slow/inattentive."
