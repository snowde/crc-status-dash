Jonathan A.,"Temple, TX",126,1,,1.0,6/23/2017,This location is not actually there! Was thinking it was located here but turned out to be a flee market area and open space. This should be removed.
Franchesca K.,"Littleton, MA",65,6,,5.0,7/17/2017,"Thank you so much, Cheesecake Factory. I came in to help open a new store here in Richmond and I went to the Cheesecake Factory alone two nights in a row. Tonight, not only did Rodney, the manager, recognize me, but he sat me and made sure I was taken care of. Both servers were pleasant, patient with me in my zombie mindset after an 11 hour shift, and so fast and caring. Rodney deserves a raise. My food came about at lightning speed and he even gave me a piece of cheesecake on the house. By the way, mango key lime is by far the best cheesecake. Don't be afraid to try it. Thanks again! Will definitely be back if I ever come back to Richmond."
Pierre W.,"Yorktown, VA",168,19,11,1.0,10/9/2016,"All I can say is never again!!!!! Never!!! While eating our food, granted they brought us cold food and had to remake it, a roach walked clean cross the table. I'm posting a pic. I'm done!!!!"
Lucas D.,"Fredericksburg, VA",0,7,,1.0,4/10/2017,"Worst experience for lunch in a long time. They cut the shrimp and half and served it like it was a complete shrimp. Horrible food, do not recommend"
Amanda B.,"Petersburg, VA",128,288,84,5.0,4/17/2016,"I love Cheesecake Factories and this place was as good as the entire chain.  Service was great, the only thing I disliked was that I had my birthday here, and I had I think 8 people coming, 3 of us were there, but they wouldn't seat us until  4th person came which was really annoying cause they could've made more money from us buying drinks while we waited the 20ish minutes for the rest of our party.  Also we didn't have a really nice setup for 8 people, and one of our persons had to sit on the end whcih we didn't think we'd mind at the beginning but after the dinner was over we all decided we didn't like that after.   All our food was really good, and as usual comes in huge servings that are amazing."
Jody D.,"Lady Lake, FL",11,142,249,3.0,11/6/2016,"A party of three so we chose this place because of the variety. Wait was not too long even though I was surprised there even was one for a late lunch. Our sever had several tables going so he was very busy and it showed in his short and quick responses. So of course, there were a couple of mishaps, but the waiter quickly fixed them. I was not thrilled with my steak tacos, the presentation was nice, but there was hardly any steak in them and the rice had a creole seasoning that I did not like at all. My husband's salad was huge, but we have had better salads at other restaurants. My favorite thing was the guacamole, but it had no salt at all so we had to add it. So in summary, for the price, we rather eat elsewhere where we can enjoy our food more and for better value. Highly doubt I'll be back."
Anony M.,"Richmond, VA",0,18,,1.0,8/7/2016,"I think Cheesecake factory relies on the premise of everyone assuming this is where rich white people go to eat. It's ""fancy"" and you can get whatever you want because the menu is 20 pages long. Have you ever heard the phrase ""jack of all trades, master of none?"". That's cheesecake factory except they are the jack of nothing but garbage food and tasteless interior decorating. I've given them a fair shake. I think I've been dragged to this location 3-4 times. Maybe more, but if I did go I blocked them out of my memory.  Before you're seated you pray to your god of choice that you will get an actual booth, and not be situated 6 inches away from the table next to you. If that fails, you pray that you will not be put next to a baby. I know there is no loving god because almost every time I've gone neither of these prayers have been answered. To be fair I don't think they deliberately put me next to a screaming child every time I go in, but considering they're trying to pack as many people under one roof as they can it's almost impossible not to be surrounded by babies. There is next to no privacy here (or at any Cheesecake Factory since they all seem to do this.). You will be given a copy of war and peace and told your server will be right with you. 40 servers will run past your table. None of them will look at you. You will wait, and wait, and wait. Suddenly someone shows up to take your drink order and promptly disappears again never to return.  Where do they go? I cannot say that I know. Must be pretty rad quitting your job at Cheesecake factory so that you can put ""i travel between dimensions and materialize from the aether at will"" on your resume.  They actually could leave for 100 years and you wouldn't have enough time to decide what to get because of the size of the menu. I get that they're trying to offer something for everyone, but restaurants are not good at this. Quick question for anyone giving Cheesecake factory more than one star: What are they known for making? Anyone? Hello? What's their famous dish other than Cheesecake? Nobody knows, or they're all sword to secrecy.  Someone will bring you bread, but only after you flag a server down and go ""Hey can you get my server? I think their name was Chris/Ashley/Jennifer/Dan/Greg/etc"" They will say ""Nobody with that name works here. Have bread."" The bread is okay though. They can make edible bread. +1 Cheesecake factory.  After you've ordered and waited months and years and eons and infinity, your food will come and you will be disappointed. I want to point to one dish that stands out as being especially mediocre, or over the top terrible. I can't though. It's all shit. Just ask for more bread. Some of this post is exaggerated just a tiny bit for effect but I actually had to ask for more bread because the food was so bad I couldn't bother eating it. I ordered a club sandwich that day which is probably the easiest sandwich in the world to not screw up. If you somehow aren't disappointed then your taste buds are shot and you should never recommend restaurants to anyone. Your opinion cannot be trusted. If someone says ""Hey where is a good place to eat"" Just say ""Sorry I'm not allowed to tell you. Some guy on yelp said so."""
Laverne B.,"Richmond, VA",43,44,54,5.0,2/11/2017,"We had a great night here today. Our waiter Arthus was wonderful. Although it was busy we were able to be seated within about a half an hour. Yes there is a large menu, but I like the variety. The fresh basil and tomato flatbread was great along with the stuffed mushrooms as an appetizer. The kids menu is nice and has a lot of variety. The portions are perfect for little kids. And of course we coulsnt leave without ordering one of their famous cheesecakes to take home with us. However my favorite is their carrot cake, it is extremely delicious!"
Silvia L.,"Midlothian, VA",137,115,125,4.0,9/8/2016,"Yay for gluten free options :) (by the way, they will make dishes GF even when not marked on the menu). Food was delicious, our server friendly and energetic, and our booth private and cozy. Our wait time on a Sunday at lunch time, was only 12 min. It took us longer to park than to be seated ;)"
Ashley R.,"Richmond, VA",5,36,2,2.0,7/17/2016,"This is my second time at Cheesecake Factory and I just can't for the life of me understand why people wait and wait for such mediocre food. The first time I went was a decent experience, but the food was just okay nothing great. This time, the entire experience was bad. We arrived around 6:15 on a Saturday and my sister put our party of 8 down and was told she couldn't be quoted a time because of the size of our party, the manager would have to do it. The manager quoted her an hour and a half... Ridiculous, but as to be expected. We were okay with that. After an hour, a member of our party went to check the status and was told it would be about 20 more minutes (sounds about right). We waited the 20 minutes and another member of our party went to check, and was told by the manager we had another hour wait. About 15 minutes later the hostess comes out looking for 2 parties to be seated, and jokingly a member of our party asked if she was looking for our party of 8... She said, ""No, but I can check... Wait. A party of 8? It might be a while..."" So she comes back out and tells us that we were quoted 2-3 hours, and we've ONLY been waiting an hour, but it'll be about 20 more minutes"". Now we're getting upset because we were quoted 1 1/2 hours, not 2-3 hours. No way we would've stuck around for potentially 3 hours waiting to eat mediocre food. So again, we wait, my uncle goes up to talk to the hostess and tells her that we were quoted 1 1/2 hours, she says, ""I'm sorry but the computer says something different"". So he goes to talk to a manager, the manager says he didn't tell her 1 1/2 hrs, so my uncle calls my sister up and the manager says he didn't remember speaking to her and he quoted all large parties 2-3 hours that night. My uncle and his gf continue to talk to the manager and eventually end up getting us seated... Separately. They were sat at a 2 person table, a couple was between us, and then the rest of us were at a 6 person table. They said they would move us together once the couple in between left, but by the time they cleared the table (15 minutes after the couple left) they had their food and it was no point in moving. It doesn't get better... When our waitress arrives (very quickly, surprisingly), she asks how everyone is. My dad, who isn't a complainer at all, started to say ""eh, could be better"", but she talks over him and cuts him off and starts asking for drink orders. She asks if we want appetizers and to put in the order for my 3 year old niece. Thanks for being quick and thoughtful, but we literally had been sitting for 2-3 minutes, with no time to look at the menu. We really felt rushed. She comes back with the drinks and just holds them out, doesn't say anything when we don't notice she's there. Just stood there waiting. She then took our orders. The food came out about 15 minutes later, I order the teriyaki chicken and baked potato soup. I don't know how the baked potato soup tastes because it never came out. The teriyaki chicken was VERY bland. I tried to fix it with salt and pepper, unfortunately both salt dispensers were damp in the inside so the salt wouldn't come out, I learned that when I opened the top and all the damp salt fell in my plate. Another waitress came around and offered to refill our drinks, and my dad asked (very politely, I might add) for more bread, she was very short with him and said ""hold on, sir!"" in a frustrated tone. Surprise, surprise... The bread never came. By this time I'm very irritated, I waited 3 hours for food that wasn't good and received terrible service in the process.  I ordered an Oreo milkshake to go which was good. And now I'm writing this review, very disappointed. The complimentary bread is good, only the brown bread, the white bread will chip your teeth. This was just an all around bad experience... And I don't even like cheesecake! Throughout this process we saw people come, eat, and leave all while we were still waiting outside. A group of 8 isn't even THAT big of a group. Anyway, in summary... Be prepared to wait, don't have too high expectations for the food or service, and expect to overpay for everything.  Oh another plus... The bar made lemonades are free refills.  I don't think I'll be going back to The Cheesecake Factory, there's nothing driving me to go back."
Hetal M.,"Toronto, Canada",43,238,279,3.0,1/15/2016,"I have to say, my hype for the Cheesecake Factory has died. being from Toronto, the closet location to me is in Buffalo at the walden galleria mall, and I used to make trips out there just to eat.. now It's been a while since, but I always remembered the food to be decent.  I was in Virginia for a work trip and saw the Cheesecake Factory as we drove by and mentioned to my colleagues that I would like to stop in one day while we're here. 1) Service: I was very unhappy with the way the server described every item on the menu identically ""it's a good portion, flavourful and my favourite""  2) Etiquette: I thought bringing around of waters for everyone was common courtesy. I asked for water with my drink and I was the only one who got a glass 3) food: like I mentioned - I remember the food being decent - but I really didn't enjoy it. I came specially for the chicken samosas but even that doesn't warrant a return. the starter sizes are HUGE and that too for a salad. I actually think it's a total waste of food. like really how can someone finish all that food? overall, an experience where I can't say I will care to return like I once did, except to walk in and take cheesecake to go."
Chii T.,"Arcadia, CA",38,125,174,5.0,2/13/2016,"Haha a review of Cheesecake Factory. Lol I am originally from Los Angeles. Cheesecake Factory was like my college canteen where we had group projects and stuff. I had been to the 1st Cheesecake Factory in the country, which happened to be in Hollywood. So I have a pretty good benchmark of what a Cheesecake Factory should look/taste/feel like.  This Cheesecake Factory location in Short Pump gets better and better in food quality. 3 years ago it was a lot less impressive. Keep up the good work. Don't get me wrong. I'm comparing this Cheesecake Factory location to the rest of the locations in the country, not to other restaurants in RVA."
Pam W.,"Richmond, VA",31,260,1201,3.0,1/13/2016,"Had lunch with colleagues here today. The good thing about The Cheesecake Factory is the variety of the menu so it's easy to please a crowd. I tried the Tuna Tataki Salad...it was light and fresh with pretty straightforward ingredients: grilled tuna, pickled ginger, mixed greens, avocado and tomatoes with soy sauce and vinaigrette dressing. It was exactly what I wanted and came in below 500 calories. I was able to eat out with the gang without overindulging, which is super easy to do at this restaurant that features massive portions."
Christie B.,"Canonsburg, PA",14,3,,1.0,4/23/2017,Have called twice in last half hour to place a takeout order.  First call placed on hold hung up at 6 minutes.  Second call placed on hold again hung up after 10 min.  Next call asked for manager on hold for 5 and 1/2 min.  Then tried to order an entree that they claimed wasn't on the menu.  I gave up.  Every Cheesecake Factory I've ever been to has stellar service.  This one not so much.
Monica R.,"Richmond, VA",28,1,,1.0,3/25/2017,The experience today was very disappointing.  The wait times were extremely long and the food was lack luster.  My experience was not very good.
Vivienne L.,"Philadelphia, PA",257,210,207,5.0,11/18/2015,Big portions! I got the Shepard's pie and tiramisu cheesecake. The tiramisu cheesecake in my opinion is better than their regular tiramisu which is more soft (melts fairly quickly). The shepard's was very filling but was still a little too temperature hot by the end of my meal (I couldn't finish it).
Eric V.,"Manakin-Sabot, VA",0,210,32,3.0,2/5/2017,Nope. Never been here before. We came because we have a gift card. About quarter to 1 on  Sunday and they are on a wait. Fortunately there are open spots on the bar. I wade through the too big menu with the piercing  wails of children in the background. I go with Chicken and Waffles. It's OK. Wife gets a Chicken sandwich. She likes it fine. I really have nothing to whine about. It's a chain in a mall. Just not my scene.
Lisa N.,"San Jose, CA",501,155,88,3.0,6/28/2014,"Food - I ordered the Louisiana Chicken Pasta and I must say, the portion was more than I expected. Definitely had the most food out of all my friends' dishes. My dish itself was on the bland side and lacked sauced. I had to add extra salt and other condiments to give it more flavor. The chicken however was really crispy, just the way I like it, without being dry. Price - Cheesecake Factory is on the more expensive side so I would come only for special occasions, not a regular dinner spot. Service - My group's waiter was beyond nice and explained to us all the dishes we had questions on very thoroughly. Our water was constantly refilled and he somehow always came at  the right time to ask us how we were doing."
Charles B.,"Richmond, VA",64,103,240,3.0,8/20/2015,"I have been visiting Cheesecake Factory going back to the B-More harbor location and they always give you a lot of food and a great atmosphere for groups but it's still a franchise.  The Richmond location is a great spot and the service is always good here.  Of course we ordered so much food and then packed it all up because we had to eat the cheesecake.  Even with great service and a menu so big you need to be quizzed on, I give out a 3 because the food is just ok, not in a disappointing way but you know going in you will drop $$$ and your saying after the fact ....that was ok but not great  I think I'm one of the few that like the Cheesecake Bistro that used to be out Stony Point."
Natia J.,"Timonium, MD",5,114,69,5.0,12/16/2016,Eric is an excellent waiter. He works in the bar area. He is very nice and delivers great service. The banana cream cheesecake was delicious. I also ordered the skinnylicious firecracker salmon rolls... I feel like I need to loosen up my belt a little lol I am stuffed and happy :)
