Yvonne M.,"Richmond, VA",223,625,785,4.0,9/23/2015,"We went to CF for a birthday dinner...with the intention of trying something new. I always get the same thing because I love it, but this time we stepped outside our box and tried the salmon. Im new to loving salmon thanks to another restaurant in NVA, that makes a  Cedar smoked salmon. My daughter and I tried to talk the server into asking the chef to make it cedar smoked but she wasnt budging...told us to try the blackened instead and it was good..not as good as the smoky cedar but good nonetheless. The salmon comes with steamed broccoli and mashed potatoes. The broccoli was a little boring.. it could use a sprinkle or two of some seasoning or butter..but if your trying to be healthy its perfect. The mashed potatoes were super chunky but delicious, clearly handmade. You cant really mess up the taste of a potato though can you?? I also tried the buffalo blast appetizer.. ohhh myyy god Ive been missing out on these!!! they bring you these enormous fried buffalo triangle shaped bites that could fill you up as a meal. Theyre piled high on the plate and fried into a golden crispy bite... these are a new must-have for me. Honorable mention goes to the free bread they bring you.. but not that horrible hard crusty white sourdough bread.. you can break a tooth off on this bread.. thumbs down!! However....the pumpernickel bread is banging!! I wanted to ask for a loaf to take home.. its hot and buttery. My favorite bread. (Note: if trying to stay off bread DONT TASTE THIS BREAD lol) Last but never least.. you cant go to CF without getting a slice of cheesecake. I tried a new carrot cake one.. it was yummy.. so yummy I forgot to take a picture lol.  It doesnt trump my all time fave vanilla bean but its a good runner up.  Overall... great new experience."
Maximillian S.,"Port Royal, VA",0,1,,3.0,8/2/2017,"The food was really good. Huge portions for the price. But everything seemed like in slow motion while we were there. Granted we asked for extra time to decide what we wanted (their menu is like, 20 pages), once we were ready, we had our menus closed and tried eye contact a few times before our server came over. The cheesecake is of course amazing. And other than the slowness, the service was good. I'd only eat here again if I planned ahead and have lots of extra time."
Chris L.,"Midlothian, VA",67,458,18,4.0,9/28/2015,I'm not sure how Cheesecake Factory only gets an average 3 stars here on yelp.  I mean they pretty much do everything right.  The food selection is amazing and what is even more amazing is that it is all good.  Very good drinks and of course the deserts are hard to beat as well. I take a star away because it is a chain and it can get crowded (a line pretty much through the holidays) and Richmond has such over the top great local restaurants. But really - I mean the place is great there is no denying it!
Tim L.,"Bumpass, VA",39,75,36,4.0,12/13/2016,The food always seems to be hit or miss. But they never miss on the cheesecake! YUM!!!
Taylor M.,"Richmond, VA",0,14,12,5.0,2/14/2017,Went here for an early V day dinner with my boyfriend. Service was wonderful. The fried mac and cheese never disappoints. Got the salted caramel cheesecake to go and it was delicious.
Stephanie G.,"Henrico, VA",5,145,103,5.0,6/7/2016,"I know its a chain, but it is still good. The menu is larger than needs be, but most of the stuff is good. Plus, CHEESECAKE! The only down side is the bread. Its hard, they half way slice it so you gotta put your hands on it to rip it apart cause again its hard. But that's me reaching to complain. Service is good, wait time sucks."
Ty M.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,41,14,4.0,6/26/2017,When you go to the cheesecake factory would you go for? That's a rhetorical question you go for the cheesecake LOL and the food and the customer service. I'm never disappointed in either category when I go here. It is a little on the pricey side but it's normally worth it
Real Friends X.,"Tinley Park, IL",67,53,27,4.0,3/24/2016,"Papa Georgio was having his retirement party here so instantly you know I'm showing up. What I was met with though was savory, flavorful apps (short for appetizers) at first, but overly saucy and if I may take from another reviewer's choice of word, ""soupy"" entrees. The food also had notes of unwashed hands, cumin, and nutmeg. The cheesecake made me gassy, a small price to pay for a decadent dessert. Better check my blood pressure though uh oh. I must say though, the service was great. Papa Georgio even did a line dance with our server, he's a crazy guy haha LOL I can't wait to retire... hopefully I get that raise on Monday, I wasn't sure what Georgie meant by credit card roulette... I should go now"
Michelle W.,"Richmond, VA",78,55,36,2.0,3/29/2016,"This place was hit or miss for me. I went in with a friend on a Saturday night with no reservation and ended up only having to wait 30 minutes for a table for two, which was a miracle considering how many people were waiting. We saw people turn away just after us when they were quoted an hour or more for three or more people. In the essence of full disclosure, I know that it's pretty much mandatory to make a reservation for this place because I've been to the one in Virginia Beach which has 3 hour waits on a Saturday night. We just got lucky I suppose. Anyway, the atmosphere is pretty bustling and we were seated and greeted pretty quickly. Our waitress was pleasant and helpful, even kidding with us that the menu is like a small novel. This is where the problems with this place start. When people are offered so many options, it is hard to make a decision on just one thing. The menu is probably 20 pages, which is excessive to put it politely. They also change the menu twice a year, so it only adds to the confusion for consumers. I ended up with a crispy chicken costoletto, or in better terms, breaded chicken with asparagus and potatoes. Definitely not worth the very high price tag of $18... The cheesecake I ordered to go was delicious but very rich. I ended up only eating half before tossing the rest. They also don't have any prices on the menu for their drinks or wine, which should be a red flag to customers that they are overpriced!  I think if you're just looking for dessert to share, it's a good idea to order for pickup and take it home, but the dinner fare here isn't anything to write home about."
Mike B.,"Chesterfield Court House, VA",13,396,,4.0,7/14/2015,"Not typically a big fan of chain restaurants, but we had some gift cards given to us about a year ago, and finally decided to wade through the endless line waiting to get into Cheesecake. I'm glad we did. We went for a late lunch, but I don't think it matters when you go.....you're going to wait. We had the loaded tater tots for an appetizer, which were awesome. I had the classic burger, and my wife the baja chicken tacos. We both liked out meals very much, and it's a TON of food. To the point that there was no way we were going to order cheesecake.  Here's an idea for Cheesecake: put a scoreboard type sign on the outside of your building somewhere, and show the current average wait time. There are ALWAYS people sitting around outside your front doors waiting for their number to come up, and I would bet most people like me just drive on by, assuming that the wait is in the range of 1 hr. But if the ""scoreboard"" said the average wait was 15, 20 minutes or whatever, I would be inclined to swing in and eat. Just a thought."
David H.,"Hampton, VA",167,142,927,3.0,3/4/2015,"Service was good and professional. I had the pit roast beef sandwich and it had no taste what so ever but the fries were good, but could have had a bigger portion. My daughter had the miso salmon  and it was huge and very good. My wife had the meatloaf and she loved it."
Miss Foodie R.,"Midlothian, VA",1,21,61,5.0,7/4/2016,Who doesn't love his place? Good food and huge portions. There's always food to take home. I got the shrimp this last time with fried mac and cheese and tiramisu cheesecake. A+
Lela C.,"Fredericksburg, VA",0,3,,1.0,6/29/2017,"I like the atmosphere. We started out with calamari as an appetizer; however, when our appetizer arrived , we noticed that we more octopus than calamari. Perhaps this dish should be renamed octopus. The batter was undercooked and falling off the octopus. As a matter of fact after eating some of this we lost our appetite. Eat at your own risk."
Cliff Christy G.,"Richmond, VA",14,7,1,2.0,12/18/2016,The service is slow to non existent. The food was served warm to cold.  The orange chicken was good for being cold. The waiter never refilled our drinks. Not their best day.
Samantha C.,"Richmond, VA",93,3,,3.0,12/16/2016,"Went to the Cheesecake Factory on Tuesday night, had a great pasta meal and cheesecake. Would've been a better experience if the service wasn't So bad.. our waitress was serving the tables next to us and not even getting us drink refills! Also was rude and was just standing around with another server when we had been waiting for her to get our checks from us for 10 minutes.."
David H.,"Washington, DC",111,774,769,1.0,2/18/2015,"Not sure why this place is so popular (everywhere), the menu is approximately 35 pages long and filled with lots of stuff that will make you wish you cooked instead. why is all of the cheesecake so damn sweet?"
Vanessa J.,"Charlottesville, VA",18,12,30,2.0,4/6/2016,"I have eaten at several Cheese Cake Factories in my life time but this is perhaps the worst one yet....I don't know who the chef is today (4-6-16) but there is such a thing called ""seasoning--salt and pepper would be a start"".....Gordon Ramsey would tell you to ""hang up your apron"" and Donald Trump would tell you ""YOUR FIRED""!! Please people save your money you're only paying for the name."
Kimberlee Z.,"Mechanicsville, Richmond, VA",52,63,43,3.0,4/17/2016,"I was so excited to try this place! I was hearing about it for years when I lived in Las Vegas, so when I got to Richmond, my cousin took me. I ordered the arugula salad which was ""meh"", and the crab cakes which were pretty okay. Not disgusting, but not flavor packed.  The two stars are for the awesome cheesecake!!!!! I've tried many flavors, visiting just for the cheesecake. Definitely worth a try!"
Patrick G.,"Midlothian, VA",164,97,31,1.0,1/2/2016,"I am perplexed why this place is so busy.  Floors were dirty and slippery Bathrooms not cleaned at all Service was slow and boring The food was a 2 star at best. Ordered the chicken Marsala and it had absolutely no flavor at all. I was thinking they must have forgotten the Marsala sauce but if you focused you could taste a hint.  We have now been waiting for 30 minutes for our check and still no check.  Not one person in our party was impressed with their food. Even our kids barely touched their food and it's mostly coming home to end up in the trash can tomorrow. Great location, good atmosphere but not sure why this place has a good following."
Angela P.,"Glen Allen, VA",0,5,,5.0,5/11/2017,They really strive to make sure customers are happy and that they will return. Food is consistent and always delicious.  Highly recommend.
