Jennifer F.,"Glen Allen, VA",1,7,,1.0,4/1/2017,"Won't answer phone, can't be bothered to take a carry out order and after 5 phone calls, they hung up while I was on hold. Never trying again!"
Lisa H.,"Glen Allen, VA",26,1,,1.0,4/12/2017,"Horrible management, bad service...There were 6 of us and only 4 of us had our food, the waitress forgot to put in the last order and by they time we received it everyone else was already finished eating. Nobody told us about the error they just let us continuously wait until we asked to speak to a manager. The manager was not apologetic at all, she didn't ask if we wanted a appetizer while waiting for the food to be fixed nor did she offer to discount the bill for the food that wasn't made."
Nikki G.,"Richmond, VA",38,51,105,4.0,9/2/2013,"Had orange chicken, side of mashed potatoes, my mom had fish & chips. The crab artichoke dip is great but I found the croutons greasy. Our lunch sizes were huge! Delicious food, nice service. We were in the corner so that was my big issue but I didn't ask to move. Tiramisu cheesecake is  ! Love the Firefly cocktail!"
Rick A.,"Beaverdam, VA",0,2,,4.0,9/7/2016,"My Lady and I had dinner there on 9/06/2016.  The Steak Diane was very good.  The mashed potatoes were excellent as was the bread.  Our waiter (Austin) was very efficient, quick to refill our drinks, offered good suggestions on menu selections and quickly fixed a mix up on part of my Lady's side dish.  Of course, the cheese cake was very good. We sat outside as it was a pleasant night, so the noise level was pretty low.  We were able to have a conversation without any issues. it is a tad pricey but the portions were just right. We will go back there again and will ask for a table in Austin's section."
Crystal B.,"Ringgold, VA",60,3,,1.0,10/6/2016,It's not often that I write a bad review but after going here for my birthday tonight I hate to say it wasn't enjoyable.  After skimming the menu I finally decided on a Southwest chicken sandwich... the chicken came to the table RAW. With the dim lighting it was hard to tell but you could see the variation in colors once I touched it the rareness of the chicken was obvious.  The server apologized and took the sandwich back (he handled it very well) a few min late the manager arrived and apologized offering a soup while I waited.  Once the sandwich arrived again I was off put by it still being the same piece of chicken and the exact same fixings (I had gotten avocado on the top of the bread before they took the sandwich back)  which just had the raw chicken on it   I was given a complementary cheesecake slice but I feel like this situation could have been handled better just by simply using new fixings.
Lamar J.,"Richmond, VA",32,7,18,4.0,8/16/2014,"Initially, my plans for yelp were to only review small, lesser-known, mom-and-pop establishments. Clearly, chains would not make this list. However, since myself and a friend have been on a happy-hour kick, I had to add Cheesecake Factory to the list. Here's why: Pros: Options and affordability are the driving factors that can make or break a place as a happy-hour haven. Their menu has three pages that include 40 (yes....40!!!) appetizer/small plate options. Have your typical burger sliders, or you can live a little and indulge in chicken samosas (they're great if you like curry). Salads also make the cut for those who want them, but a salad is the last thing on my mind after a day's work.  As far as drinks, there are a few cocktails (do a long beach iced tea if you can handle it) along with select wines, beer, and well-drink options which are typical for a happy hour. The icing on the cake for this place is that EVERY SINGLE OPTION on the menu is LESS THAN $7!!!!! (Imagine that I'm yelling this in a field of wacky waving inflatable arm flailing tube men and a cloud of confetti).  The cons: Happy hour is restricted to the bar area. So, you have to get there early on more popular days, and you can't enjoy your drinks outside.  The only location for RVA is in the west end- Traffic is generally unbearable and the crowd may be a little too ""buttoned-up"" if you're looking for a place with flair.  If the short list of cons doesn't deter you, it shouldn't, stop by between 4 to 6 Monday through Friday and enjoy!!"
Gerard D.,"Williamsburg, VA",0,4,,5.0,3/23/2017,"My wife and I took our daughter and infant grandson to dinner at the Short Pump Cheesecake Factory yesterday and were very pleased with the food, service and ambience.  All three meals were delicious and very nicely prepared.  The waiter, Jeff, was very attentive but what impressed us most was the very focused attention paid to our concern about my grandson's extreme allergy to peanuts.  Jeff took our orders to the kitchen and obtained confirmation that peanuts were nowhere near the food preparation area.  The kitchen servers who delivered the meals to our table stated that each plate was prepared with peanut allergy awareness.  Very comforting since a mistake could cost my grandson his life.  Thanks for a great evening."
Dajana G.,"Spotsylvania, VA",11,21,10,4.0,3/22/2016,We came for the happy hour appetizers.  They were absolutely delicious and ordered different cheesecakes to go. This is one of my favorite chain restaurants. I only sit at the bar because every time I sit in the dining area they take forever. That's the only reason I gave it 4 stars. They're kinda slow ! But never at the Bar...very friendly bartender.
Riana E.,"Waldorf, MD",0,18,31,5.0,3/13/2016,I love the cheesecake factory so much I go every year for my birthday even though they're always super crowded I don't mind the wait. I always get the Fried macaroni and cheese for an appetizer. For an entrée I always get the monster burrito. The strawberry lemonade is also really good. The cheesecake that I've had so far include the Oreo cheesecake the tuxedo cheesecake and the red velvet cheesecake also the chocolate layer cake is really good.
Christina K.,"Richmond, VA",32,52,3,1.0,7/2/2016,"Yesterday I got my favorite salad from this place, chicken tostada salad. Wow what a disappointment, I did a take out and I swear there was a 6 little chucks of chicken. I'm not exaggerating, 6 chucks for a $18 salad. Come  cheesecake, veggies prices has not gone up that much. I should just stay way from this short pump cheesecake !!"
Carol B.,"Henrico, VA",33,8,1,1.0,7/13/2016,"Don't try the curbside pickup.  First of all the phone number is not correct on their website.  So, I called the main phone number and had to get transferred to place my order.  I was put on hold over 5 minutes.  Then when I arrived at curbside I had to call again to let them know I was there.  Again I was put on hold more than 5 minutes.  I hung up and called back then was told they were very busy so it was going to be a while before they could bring my order to the car.  So, the Curbside pickup does not work.  They should never even offer it because it was painful to deal with."
Ashley G.,"Richmond, VA",211,373,1687,2.0,10/16/2014,"Service?  Meh. Fries? Decent. Fish tacos? Cold, dry, stale, bland.  14$ I'll never see again.  After asking for more tarter or fish taco sauce, it was still bland as the days are bright.  Such a disappointment.    After seeing me clearly dissatisfied with my food the server didn't make a move to ask why. (I'd only eaten one and picked at the second. There were a total of four)  Asking desperately for more flavor didn't seem to tip him off either.  Humpf."
M M.,"Norfolk, VA",0,36,25,1.0,6/27/2016,"Worst experience at Cheesecake Factory ever.  We arrived at 1030am Sunday when they opened at 10 am.  So not a lot of patrons at that time.  While I waited at hostess stand,  I saw at least 6 servers just waiting for tables to work.  It was to be a table for 3, including my 83 y/o mom.   I requested an outdoor seat in the shade.  The hostess took us outside with no regard for my mom's slower pace.   She tried to shove us into a sunny spot.  I refused.  I asked to go into shaded area, she said no servers.  (Despite 5 or 6 just hanging out---waiting to work a table).   Then she walked us back to hostess booth, again going way too fast for an 80 + y/o person.  Then hostess slunk back into an office.  Said she would ask if I could be seated in the shaded outdoor area.   She returned.  With bitch face on.  She walked us out to the outside seating area and told us to pick any table.  10 minutes later.  I called the Cheesecake Factory we were at.  I asked to speak w a Mgr or Asst Mgr.  I was talking w one.....Joey.  I told him we have been waiting for service.  He said he'd send some one out and he would be out too.  Still waited.   Finally a sever greeted us.  Took drink order.  Waited and waited again.  It was coffee.  Finally coffee arrived via a runner. (As is typical at Cheesecake Factory) but no creamer and we had ordered creamer w our coffee order.  Still waited for creamer as our coffee got less and less warm.   Finally my sister went into bar and got cream from bartender.   Still no Joey..... As he had said, I'll be right out.   Finally placed food order. But other couple who came in and ordered AFTER us, got their food before we did.   The only thing that mellowed me out and stopped me from verbally shredding them to bits was the fact I had 2 mimosas by the end of my meal.   My sister had to ask for grape jelly twice.  She was given strawberry jelly. I just don't know how much more they could screw up the service or my impression.  But then our food arrived. Her omelet was rubbery and had minimal filling.  No salt or pepper on tables.   Earlier Joey the Mgr, said he would come ck on us again.  We were waiting to tell him of the epic fail in service and quality.  HE NEVER RETURNED even though HE SAID HE WOULD!!!! We finally asked for him to return.  Explained politely our disappointing experience and asked him to take off the charge for my sisters omelet.  He did.   This was the absolutely worst experience at CCF ever.  I will NEVER go to this one again.  I encourage all who read this to go anyplace else.  There are lots of options at short pump. Heck even fast food would have been a better experience."
Robert W.,"Midlothian, VA",0,17,1,1.0,1/22/2017,"forget the Bang-Bang Chicken and Shrimp ... not enough meat and fish combined to fit in a can of tuna !!! ... huge portion of brown rice to make it look like you're getting a sumptuous meal ... supposed to have thai-style spice and curry, but truthfully could hardly tell it was present in the small sauce edged around the plate ... when they told us there would be an HOUR wait for a table, i politely smiled and walked the whole dining areas counting 12 tables unoccupied ( not dirty ) and ready to go !!! ... head waiter and hostesses acted totally clueless when I came back and said quite audibly that 12 tables were unoccupied !!! ... if you're gonna spend $19.50 for the Bang-Bang Chicken and Shrimp it ought to be as good as a sirloin steak at Texas Roadhouse for half the price !!! ... Just say NO , to the Cheesecake Factory !!!!!"
Phil M.,"Myrtle Beach, SC",141,244,63,5.0,8/6/2015,"Amazing food. We had a pizza, and it was fresh and hot. The peppers and toppings were just enough. The red velvet cheesecake was decadent. Our server was very accommodating and friendly. The restaurant was clean and in good standing. I would suggest this restaurant to anyone!"
Rachel W.,"Richmond, VA",214,9,,1.0,7/22/2016,"This one star has an explanation. Our waitress was AMAZING and so sweet- best I've had in a while. The food at the table was overall good, but my meal was not edible at all due to an overwhelming amount of vinegar covering my chicken. The waitress made it right and gave me a new dish, saying my meal would be comped. The meal ended up being charged and we requested to speak to the manager, named Joey, just to see if there was a mix up, and the way he spoke to my sister and I was appalling. He belittled us and was extremely rude, and ruined our night. We only asked him a simple question and he was completely horrible to us. I have worked in the food industry for 6 years and value customer service immensely, and the way my sister and I were treated tonight was completely unacceptable and I will not be returning to this restaurant location ever again."
Lynda C.,"Richmond, VA",115,96,168,4.0,7/31/2015,"I just love Cheesecake factory! Its worth the wait, when its crowded!"
Dennis H.,"Midlothian, VA",2,27,,5.0,9/29/2015,"Always busy, so get there early. Lovely atmosphere, but no dress code. Usually large potions, may have some to take home.  Extensive menu and a huge variety, definitely something for everyone. Great service and always aim to please.  But the food is only delicious!"
Claudia H.,"Verona, VA",76,199,19,4.0,5/16/2016,"I read some of the other reviews and I get the complaints about the service since I agree that can ruin a meal. However, I've never had service issues here and the food is as great as any other Cheesecake Factory. The menu is very large, with a wide variety of food, and some yummy combinations. If you cant find something to eat here there is something wrong with you. They even have gluten free stuff for you intolerant people. My friend and I usually get their salads since they are huge, delicious, and satisfying. Of course looking at their over 15 cheesecakes is essential. Last time we had the tuxedo cheesecake which was to die for. Highly recommend if you are a short pump, want a delicious quick lunch, and want to splurge a bit on calories."
Patricia L.,"Laurel, MD",2,51,70,5.0,10/5/2015,Service was awesome from Evan and the food was very good! My pineapple mojito was the best over ever had! Dessert was the Godiva cheesecake Oh my!!!! Outstanding!
