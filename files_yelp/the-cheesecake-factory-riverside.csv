Lesley C.,"West Covina, CA",422,521,24,4.0,11/21/2017,"My friend and I decided to meet at this Cheesecake because it was in the middle for both of us, distance-wise. I am always up for Cheesecake because the food is consistent from location to location, same for the service as well.  Louisiana Chicken Pasta Parmesan Crusted Chicken Served Over Pasta with Mushrooms, Peppers and Onions in a Spicy New Orleans Sauce Chinese Chicken Salad Chicken Breast, Rice Noodles, Lettuce, Green Onions, Almonds, Crisp Wontons, Bean Sprouts, Orange and Sesame Seeds. Tossed in Our Special Chinese Plum Dressing. My go-to is always the Louisiana Chicken Pasta. I just love the flavors and the perfectly parmesan crusted chicken. I have yet to find another restaurant that offers a similar dish. My friend ordered the Chinese Chicken Salad. The rice noodles were very interesting. They were piled on high and each length were very long. We weren't sure how to eat them since it's not like one could just take a bite with the salad. We were eating them one by one or trying to crush them into smaller more manageable bite-sized pieces. Overall, the flavors were delicious but it sure seemed like a complicated dish to eat. Parking is horrible, one way and weird mazes to try to exit the parking lot. Just trying to find a parking spot was also confusing, make sure to follow those signs and directions of parking spots! Some people don't care and drive in the lanes, opposite of spots. Overall, flavors were okay here but for some reason, it wasn't what I usually expect out of Cheesecake Factory. The prices have also seemed to have gone up. Portions are still more than enough, but costs will deter me from visiting a Cheesecake Factory location too often."
Tyler P.,"Corona, CA",106,5,,1.0,1/6/2018,"3 hours... Waited 30 min for a table... Waited 5 minutes for water... All that is ok. From the time we got our water till the time the dude took our order...45 min... Our food came out about an hour after ordering it... My wife had a burger...with no sauces for some reason...(not what she ordered) I got an overpriced small portion of jambalaya... After asking for the check, Waited another 30ish minutes for the check and for them to box up our cold food... This place is overpriced and has terrible service..."
David G.,"Mexicali, Mexico",26,7,,2.0,12/24/2017,"This very business is the one which made our wedding cake, which was all sugar-free cheesecake and was excellent. So, we decided to go there for lunch.  I should mention that this was Christmas Eve, but the resteraunt was not very crowded. First, I walk with a cane, but the waiters delivering food were rude and acted like they had the right of way.  Then, every step of the service was slow.  They were slow in seating us, slow in taking our order, extremely slow in delivering the food and exasperatingly slow in bringing our check. The food, on the other hand, was very good.  We had a Cuban sandwich.  My wife and I split one and could barely finish it. The whole thing was confusing because the restaurant was not understaffed or overcrowded."
Kenya T.,"Riverside, CA",2,102,17,5.0,12/25/2017,Service is always great! I always go with my old faithful and get the Chicken Bellagio so good. Honestly have been many times never had a bad waiter or waitress.
Alex A.,"Fontana, CA",0,3,5,5.0,12/30/2017,We've always asked for these plates and at different locations as well. We've always received great service and the food is consistently great! Alina was our waitress this time. She was came around just enough times to ask how were doing and asked if we like to have our leftovers boxed up.
Diane A.,"Rowland Heights, CA",382,200,233,5.0,6/18/2017,"I always dread going to Cheesecake Factory because of the notorious seating wait times.  However, I ate here this past weekend and it was my 1st time at this location.  Despite it being prime dinner time on a Saturday night, seating for a party of 20 was a lot quicker compared to the Brea / Huntington Beach locations, even with having a large que of other parties also waiting to be seated. The waitstaff was awesome and so accomodating to our large party.  We had 20 people in our group, and everyone's order came out correct and absolutely delicious! This literally was the best experience I've ever had at ANY cheesecake factory location, So, BIG thanks to the staff for a great experience.  I believe our waiters were TIM & NOEL. Also, one of the awesome Managers (JOE) kept checking on our table to make sure everyone was enjoying the food & service.  Talk about quality assurance!  And incase you were wondering, I enjoyed the Shepherd's Pie entree...deeelish (my favorite)!  Thanks again JOE, TIM & NOEL - i hope i got their names right. Lol!"
Shelby J.,"Lakewood, CA",44,149,485,3.0,8/3/2017,"I'm slowly loosing hope in this restaurant... what I used to think I was a great, quality place to eat with loads of options is becoming to be quite the disappointment. This location especially.  It's always crowded here on the weekends and in my opinion this location seems to be a little on the dirty side. It just seems like everything is in disarray.  I've noticed that anytime I order an alcoholic beverage it's watered down or too sweet. The food doesn't always seem the freshest or as good as other locations when I eat here. I think the servers here are pretty good, but I'd suggest going elsewhere to dine."
Kai C.,"Rancho West, San Bernardino, CA",0,2,3,4.0,12/24/2017,"Good food and excellent service! However, personally it's not my thing. Very good atmosphere and friendly waiting service. They have a special called BBQ Smokehouse Burger that is quite delicious! It's quite a large portion and something that would be great to buy when particularly hungry. Good family environment if you have kids. They also have Dr. Pepper!"
Lisa E.,"Irvine, CA",22,180,112,5.0,9/9/2017,"Came here for dinner!  Ordered: bang bang chicken and shrimp  Taste: I am amazed on how delicious this plate was. The plate of food was so big, it's enough for 2 meals. I loved how the curry was a little sweet! The sweetness adds a good compliment to the shrimp and chicken. I'll definitely order this dish again. I like how big their portions are, and they give you free complimentary bread to start your meal."
Arlene J.,"Perris, CA",0,5,8,1.0,1/3/2018,I'm really disappointed with the service I received today. I waited patiently for 20 minutes to be seated only to be seated at a small table. Then my boyfriend and I were finally seated and ordered our food. I ordered an orange chicken. After 35 minutes of waiting this supervisor said that the sauce for my orange chicken wasn't coming out the right way. I was okay and decided to order some steak tacos. Fifteen minutes later they told me my orange chicken was coming soon. I was so confused I thought I was receiving the steak tacos. THEN they told me either of those weren't even ready. After speaking to the manager I was so embarrassed and disappointed in their service my boyfriend and I just left. Worst anniversary ever.
Lolita J.,"Riverside, CA",58,65,89,1.0,1/8/2018,"Food was good, but service, not good. What's the purpose of writing the Order down if your going to get orders incorrect. I don't understand. I have to say this is the most disappointing time I've ever been here. Savannah came in the tail end, she's a blessing."
Courtney P.,"Riverside, CA",0,3,,1.0,1/7/2018,"After several extremely disappointing experiences at this location, I decided it was finally time for a review. We have ordered their curbside take out multiple times, and every single time we have had very long wait times. It is understandable that restaurants get busy during dinner hours, but having to wait an extra 45 minutes past the time that was given is ridiculous. My husband had to call the restaurant multiple times, then even had to get out of the vehicle and go in to the restaurant to pick up our 'curbside pick up"" food. When he did so, he was met with an attitude from the manager ('Mike') who offered only a negative attitude and absolutely no help. Reading reviews that were not recommended shows that we are not the only people who have felt this way. Another customer lost."
Angela F. W.,"San Francisco, CA",316,577,3487,4.0,1/19/2017,"Was feeling cheesy so I decided to stop by the Cheesecake Factory before hitting the Tyler Mall.  Woah CF deff delivered!  I don't usually eat at chain restaurants. Last time I dined in a CF was 7 years ago in Boston. It was pretty decent based on my memory.  This particular location is clean snd spacious. I came after 3pm and there was still a line. Luckily I came alone so I just sat at the bar with no wait. Best seat in da house anyway IMO.  I started off w/ a mojito b/c I saw some enticing pictures on Yelp. Man oh man, I'm so glad I ordered it. My mojito was so refreshing and absolutely delish! The size was pretty generous, too. For my meal, I went with Thai glazed salmon and substituted rice with a side salad. My server recommended two Asian dressing to go with my salad. Her recommendations were spot on! The salad hit the spot just right! My Thai glazed salmon was cooked to perfection. The mojito got me buzzed quickly so one drink I'm done.  For a chain, the Cheesecake Factory exceeded my expectation! I went shopping with a full belly afterwards. A word of caution: buzzed shopping IS drunk shopping. Don't drink and shop! ;)"
Yan L.,"Redlands, CA",107,256,622,4.0,10/14/2017,"came friday, 10/13, around 8:30-9pm. wasn't too busy, short wait.  fresh vegetable salad - was trying to get the salad i got another time. thought this was it but nope. don't get this salad. literally can make this at home for more than half the cost...  bistro shrimp - actually really good. i usually get the skinnylicious lemon garlic shrimp but the portion size is small. the bistro shrimp is a good substitute for the same price. i'm going to get it from now on.  i think our server's name was corie. she was waiting so many tables and was still on top of everything. loved her!"
Manpreet R.,"Riverside, CA",16,106,374,5.0,8/7/2017,"I'm not a huge fan of chains but locally my girlfriends and I can count on this place for consistency and good food. We have not had a bad meal here.. their chicken samosas are light and delish! They have s new specialty menu out and I absolutely love the crispy pineapple chicken and shrimp.. not to mention, most places do not make espresso martini's locally but they do! Great spot for apps and Tini's or dinner with family and friends. Note happy hour is from 4-6pm!"
Salvatore H.,"Berkeley, CA",10,16,24,4.0,12/1/2017,"We always find it positive that the Americans charge half the price on happy hour but do not equalize the portions. You get a normal dinner for his money corresponding amounts, absolutely great! Also, the service is not ""slimmed down"" because of gap filling times, but prompt and attentive. Clear recommendation at the Cheesecakes Factory next to huge pieces of cake to try the other dishes. Salads are also very good!"
Matt G.,"Riverside, CA",206,352,1083,3.0,11/21/2016,"I have been coming here since it has opened so this review is based on multiple visits.  This place is located at the Tyler Galleria and is accessible from the parking lot.  The decor in this place is fabulous.  I eat here about once every two months or so.  I typically come here at night during the week because I don't like waiting to be be seated but sometimes there is still a wait during the week. Cheesecake Factory features a huge menu with a wide variety of selections including appetizers, pastas, salads, meats and even pizza.  I have tried many items here: Chicken Bellagio, Pasta Carbonera, Steak Diane, Chicken Madeira, Cuban Sandwich, Beef Dip, Fettuccine Alfredo, Four Cheese Pasta and Parmesan-Herb Crusted Chicken.  I like all of the meals but would say that my favorite is the Chicken Bellagio. Bread and butter is brought to your table before your meal shows up and the soft drinks are served in large glasses.  In my last visit my family's meals were all brought to the table except for mine and they were almost finished when my Cuban Sandwich showed up.  I did not see my server at all while my sandwich was missing so the service was not top-notch.  My Cuban Sandwich was awesome though but the French Fries could be better. There is an insane selection of Cheesecake available and they are awesome too!  I have not had a Cheesecake yet that I did not like.  I have had: Dulce De Leche Caramel Cheesecake, Lemon Raspberry Cream Cheesecake, Tiramisu Cheesecake, Key Lime Cheesecake, Craig's Crazy Carrot Cake Cheesecake and Pumpkin Cheesecake. One reason why I don't eat here more often is that this place is expensive, especially if you order cheesecake in addition to your meal.  Three stars!"
Symphony S.,"Los Angeles, CA",174,99,219,5.0,6/10/2017,Came to celebrate my best friends graduation today from college. We had a big party and didn't have to wait long. Our server was great didn't catch her name but she held her own with such a big party. I was happy that lunch specials are served on the weekend as well. Our server recommended the Georgia Peach drink and Chicken Picotta dish. As our party filled up on wheat bread by time food came we needed Togo boxes. While walking out I decided to get a slice of cheesecake. Melissa the cashier recommended the cookie dough flavor and told me the hint of walnut is why she likes it so much. Glad my Saturday afternoon was spent w such good friends family and service.
Ter O.,"Hemet, CA",12,17,7,3.0,11/6/2017,"Went in to dine the day before my birthday, food was good however, I can't give a five star review, one, my Dad ordered enchiladas, and asked if I wanted to taste, they were just AWFUL looking and tasting, two, customer service was not up to par. I have previous serving experience, and I must say, I do expect the level of service to be superb, anywhere I go, that's why people get paid to do what they do. I used to give my customers, great service and this waitress just didn't do it for me. Also, my mimosa had too much champagne and very little orange juice. One of my favorite spots, would definitely return, but not for enchiladas, and if the service lags again, I just might change my mind and take my business elsewhere. Also, no free dessert, not even because I was celebrating my birthday? #Cheap"
Betsy W.,"Lake Elsinore, CA",20,54,44,5.0,7/11/2017,"Over all, the Cheesecake Factory is my favorite for so many things! Their fusion cuisine, prices and service are so highly enjoyed! So is like the perfect combination between great flavors and casual American atmosphere. Love it! Edward my Bartender is such a nice person educated and very pleasant to talk with. I feel spoiled when I come here! My favorites, Margarita, Chicken Asian Lettuce Wrap and Thai Coconut Lime chicken.... ohhhh!!!! Delicious."
Mustapha E.,"Moreno Valley, CA",0,7,3,3.0,9/24/2017,After waiting 30 min to be seated and 50 min to get my burger. I got my burger red while I asked for extra well done burger. The rest of my friends food was good.
Shannon V.,"Moreno Valley, CA",0,67,52,1.0,12/19/2017,"Just called to make a reservation for 17 & was told they don't take reservations?!?? I've been to this location on several occasions and have heard people walk in that had reservations & in fact both their yelp & website say they take reservations. I asked & spoke with the manager who said he ""suggest someone from your party come early & wait for a table"" lmao, wtf do they do that at? I've waited over an hour for our family of 5 before I could only imagine waiting for a table to accommodate 17! Step your customer service up Cheesecake Factory, your customer service sucks & NOT the good kind!!!!!!"
铭,"Moreno Valley, CA",4,5,6,1.0,9/18/2017,"I'm really disappoint with the filet mignon which they served. It's taste like they put half bottle of salt on the steak, and I ordered medium rare it's like burnt wood. I love steak, but this one is a nightmare, and this definitely not the look that filet mignon should be！And their manager said that's normal! 36 dollars for this pice of ****!"
Garry A.,"Corona, CA",11,60,33,4.0,12/3/2017,Ok coming here on weekend is not the best idea as it is crowded as all get out but our waitress was amazing Shannon us so personal and attentive I ordered BBQ salad and was fantastic the only negative is parking I mean six slots for pick up only with a 10 minute max did they really think it would be for that. After I left the same cars were in the slots so...... Anyway great food great waitress not so great parking
Jen T.,"San Diego, CA",14,40,41,3.0,9/8/2017,"Second time at this location. The first was supposed to ba a curbside order, but they never came out to our car. My fiance ended up walking in for the order and remarked that the server really didn't seem to care and was dismissive. (I rate that time with 2 stars). The second was for happy hour. Drinks were great, food was great, had a hard time catching the attention of our server, but would rate the second experience with 4 stars."
Dinesh P.,"Riverside, CA",0,6,,4.0,8/19/2017,"I was pretty surprised that despite a chain restaurant concept, this place serves some really great food. The menu is great and despite such a humongous menu, the food was actually pretty delicious. Perfect place for a dates or families. It is a bit costly, but well all fine dining is.  Overall, a great place in terms of the food, the service and the ambiance."
C D.,"Anaheim, CA",0,3,,2.0,12/8/2017,The waiter took forever to take our order..(almost 45minutes) The food was good..But the service SUCKED!!
Tiffanie K.,"Riverside, CA",0,74,8,5.0,9/24/2017,Fast and friendly service every visit. Even when packed on weekends waiters are great!!! Worth the 30/40 minute wait on weekends
Mike S.,"Corona, CA",253,61,695,4.0,6/14/2017,"The food is always high quality and taste amazing. Me and my GF eat here often, I usually get the herb crusted salmon and my girl always gets some huge burger that she raves about lol. I'm giving them 4 stars because their customer service could use some improvement... 2 out of 3 times we go here, the server ether forgets several items of our order or gets several things wrong. They always fix the problems and are very polite though :)"
Henry N.,"Riverside, CA",515,33,19,3.0,8/17/2017,"There's honestly not much to say about the food at restaurant chains and chain restaurants since no single location that serves something that isn't offered at another chain one city over. Cheesecake Factory food is decent and moderately priced, but it's honestly a hit or miss. Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's lacking just a bit and that's just the way these places are depending on the staff and kitchen. I'm not one to want voluntarily go to cheesecake factory, but if a friend wants to meet there for lunch, I won't say no. If I ever do ""crave"" cheesecake factory, it would be for either dessert after I had just eaten elsewhere; because their cheesecake is delicious, or for Sunday brunch since the food is definitely different from what they serve throughout the week. My personal favorite is the chicken and waffles benedict, which is as you'd expect, chicken and waffles in egg's benedict form, it's definitely on the heavier side and will fill you up for only $13.  Service was top notch however, especially during my experiences at brunch hours on Sundays. You can almost always expect the wait to be long on the weekends and evenings throughout the week since it is one of the ""nicer"" restaurants here in Riverside."
David S.,"Riverside, CA",1,11,7,4.0,12/30/2017,The brunch was good. The food is always good at Cheesecake Factory.  The best part was we didn't have to wait to be seated.
Garett S.,"Riverside, CA",13,136,192,5.0,1/12/2017,"Garett's cheesecake review I just wanted to write a review for those who want to know what cheesecake to get.  I often get cheesecake and have almost tried everything on the menu.  Here are the ratings for a few of the flavors I've tried.  Hope this helps you in making your decision 5 Star - Reese's Peanut Butter Amazing! The best one you can get if you like chocolate & peanut butter. 4.5 Stars - Banana cream (best fruit based cheesecake I've tried)  + strawberries makes it even better in my opinion. Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough  4 Stars - Craig's Crazy Carrot Cheesecake (probably the best carrot cake combinations you can get), White Chocolate Raspberry, Godiva, Snickers, Salted Carmel, Adams Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake. 3 Stars (still good & worth getting, not as great as others) - Ultimate Red Velvet (good, but not the best combination of Red Velvet Cake)  Oreo (looks amazing, taste good not great) Lemon Raspberry Cream, Tiramisu, White Chocolate Macadamia Nut 2 Stars Lemon Key Lime (unless you really like key lime pie, don't get)"
Serenaa C.,"Duomo, Florence, Italy",338,26,6,5.0,2/22/2017,"Simple as this - I come here around four times a month with my boyfriend and have never had a bad experience. The servers are so helpful, friendly and always on top of their game and its what keeps me coming back.  Our server tonight, Daniel H (I believe it was), was one of the best we have ever had! Super attentive, upbeat and actually sparked up conversations. Came in a little stressed and annoyed but his personality really rubbed off of me and helped me get in a better mood! Most places, you get servers who are just fake smiling through it all and waiting until the end of the shift but at this location, they seem to really have it all down.  Food wise, its 5/5 for me. My favorite thing to get is the Firecracker Salmon Rolls. Theyre a must try if you like seafood and want a healthy little snack.  Lastly, the overall vibe this location gives off is a plus. Very dim lighting and nice artwork on the walls really help take your mind off of the outside world.  If youre looking for a nice place to eat that is not too expensive, this would be your best bet!  :)"
Chris E.,"Long Beach, CA",8,9,1,5.0,11/14/2017,"Back here again, salad, salad, salad. I got greens coming out of ears. It's always a great salad here at the Cheesecakefactory"
Desiraé P.,"Rialto, CA",41,9,1,3.0,8/31/2017,"Went with my husband, friend, & my 3 month old daughter. We went right before the staff switched out. So we had a very nice waitress then she clocked out & introduced us to our new waiter. I'm sorry but he was horrible. He barely came to see how we were doing, the restaurant wasn't even crowded so it wasn't like he was extremely busy or rush, & it was just horrible. He did try to make up for it at the end, which I definitely appreciate. So could've been better, but at least he cared.  Yes we still have him a tip."
Mr V.,"Riverside, CA",0,35,,1.0,12/8/2017,"every time I come here the girls behind the counter are so rude and sometimes make me wait for no reason at all. ""The foods being prepared in the kitchen"" yet I only ordered two cheesecakes and those aren't prepared in the kitchen....I wait 10 minutes and then another employee comes and gets them out of the fridge and hands them to me. I was in disbelief I waited for no reason. There's a guy that's sometimes there that has tattoos on his arms, he's a very nice guy and is on top of everything and professional. But whenever I have to come here to pickup I dread that the girls are there at the register because they are usually rude and unhelpful with getting me out of there fast even though the order is ready to go."
Crystal L.,"San Francisco, CA",431,6,4,2.0,2/27/2017,"Drake brought my boyfriend and I to celebrate Valentine's Day at The Cheesecake Factory this year. All I want to know is, why is the Lemon Raspberry Cream Cheesecake (rated #8 by Thrillist and highly recommended by our server) doused in so much raspberry sauce?  I'll stick with the ""Original with Fresh Strawberries"" next time."
Honr S.,"Corona, CA",0,10,4,5.0,11/10/2017,"Over all Cheesecake Factory is my favorite restaurant ,today I was there with my daughter and my husband ,our servers was nice and very friendly ,special thanks to manager  . My food wasn't crispy enough ,after I let her to know she changed it immediately,and mean while I was waiting for my food our servers offered me free salad and very fast I had my perfect crusted chicken Romano I highly recommend this Cheesecake Factory location they don't let you leave sad ."
Dillon S.,"Anaheim, CA",0,7,,1.0,10/4/2017,Bad food. Bad service.  20 mins for drinks  30 mins for bread  Burger was awful and when I told my waitress she told me that's just my opinion.
Mitchell C.,"Corona, CA",81,63,,4.0,7/26/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite restaurants. They have a massive menu, but I am prone to regret so I always stick to the few dishes that I know will satisfy me. I typically order either a Kobe burger or the stuffed chicken tortillas and both are top notch entrees. They give you free bread (squaw, I think, and sourdough), but be careful because it's easy to get carried away and soon enough you're too full for the actual meal you're paying for. It's dimly lit and could be great for a romantic date night, but I've only gone during peak hours and I've had to wait anywhere between 15-40 minutes for a table. The non-booth tables are pretty compacted. If you're not lucky enough to get a booth, it's common to have complete strangers dining three feet away from you on either side. Can't post a review for The Cheesecake factory without giving a shoutout to the cheesecake. I love cheesecake. The Cheesecake factory has great cheesecake. They offer different variations and flavors and I'm sure everybody would be able to find something that they like.  I've been here several times and the customer service is always decent to very good so no complaints on that front. If I have leftovers (and I usually do because the portions are generous), they'll often box it up for me."
