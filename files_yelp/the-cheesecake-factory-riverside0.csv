Daniel D.,"Corona, CA",1,60,30,2.0,10/20/2015,"Just like a strip club on a Tuesday at lunchtime, this Cheesecake Factory Restaurant did not have their 'A' squad working.  When I arrived I informed the Hostess that I had another person meeting me who would be coming from work and that I would prefer to be seated so I could order ahead. I was promptly seated and the Hostess said she would  seat the other half of my party once she arrived. I gave the Hostess our names for easy reference.  The Server came by as I was looking over their beer list. They only have three (3) beers on draft, but did have several bottle beers. I passed on the beer and told the Server this was my first time at a Cheesecake Factory.  The Server said to let her know when my party arrives  (guess she wouldn't be able to see her sitting there) and did not offer me water or another type of beverage, obviously adhering to the Governor's mandate to reduce water use. After sitting in my seat for approximately 10 minutes, my Server offered me some water (this was after 1p.m. and the restaurant was slow). I informed my Server that I was ready to order our food.  I ordered a hamburger that came with a small salad and and asked for Italian dressing. My Server said that they did not have Italian, but had ""Thousand Island."" I then asked if that was my only choice, which she replied, ""I only said Thousand Island because it's close to Italian."" Huh??? They actually have Balsamic Vinaigrette which is closer to Italian than Thousand Island. I asked my Server what type of condiments come on the hamburger because it's not listed on the menu. My server then replied, ""I think it comes with mayonnaise, but I'm not sure."" Huh???? Hamburgers are kind of a common lunch food. You would think that the server would know what came on a hamburger. When the other half of my party arrived, she was not directed to where I was sitting. She gave the Hostess our names, but was told by the Hostess that she ""was free to walk around the restaurant and look"" for me. When the food arrived, the food runner was real nice and attentive. I asked that my burger be cooked ""Medium."" It came pre-cut and it was obvious that it was under cooked as you could see the blood being soaked up by the bread.  This review only covers lunch, as I've never been there for dinner. I'm hoping their dinner staff is much more competent then the lunch staff that I dealt with."
Cathy O.,"San Bernardino, CA",10,27,,5.0,3/1/2016,"Came here for the first time a few nights ago and just loved it. My girlfriends made fun of me for never having been here till now. The wait was a bit longer than most restaurants in the area but that's just testimony to the great service and great food this place provides.  Trust me; it was well worth the wait. Everyone, from our hostess to our waitress were just so nice and aimed to please - very, very friendly and accommodating. We weren't the easiest crowd to please and the staff took it all in stride and bent over backwards for us. I had the ""Bang-Bang"" Chicken - a Thai dish - and it was absolutely delicious, well prepared, piping hot, and very flavorful. To top off the meal, I chose the Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake and it too was absolutely delish.  I was also pleasantly surprised by the reasonable menu prices, compared to similar places. I can't say enough good things about this place. Definitely no disappointments here. I am kicking myself for not having tried it sooner.  I'll certainly be back."
Jasa S.,"Lake Elsinore, CA",56,128,119,5.0,6/19/2014,"Good food and even better cheesecake (except the chocolate mousse blech).  Turkey avocado club is sooooo good. So are their burgers, pasta and grilled cheese.  Godiva chocolate cheesecake and Chris' outrageous are my personal favorites."
Lisa L.,"Riverside, CA",0,2,,5.0,7/20/2015,"After a lot of recommendes I finally arrived to the Cheesecake Factory.  The food was delichous and taste like its made from  high quality ingridients. The service was awesome, every tiny request was fulfilled by the waiter who rememberd everything that we orderd  (we were a table of 12 people) and took care that we are satisfied. There is no doubt that I will come back again :)"
Susan B.,"Eastvale, CA",197,37,30,5.0,7/1/2016,"Last Friday, my husband and I spent our date night at CF.  Other than our food tasting incredible (as usual), our waiter, Andy was awesome! He was so sincerely friendly and accommodating.  When we paid our bill, he asked me ""can I fix you an ice tea to go?"" I was floored by that gesture!! How great is that?? :)"
Tosha L.,"Riverside, CA",41,189,333,4.0,6/28/2014,"Glad they have happy hour now, and the avocado rolls I love so much are on the menu for $5. They are sooooooo good. I ordered a JW Pink Lemonade from the happy hour menu and it was not even half way strong. Tasted like there was no liquor in it what so ever."
Dana G.,"Redlands, CA",61,19,,2.0,7/30/2015,"The service was not good at all. 10 minute wait just for our drink order. 1 beer 1 mohito tooke another 10-15 minutes to get those. After the runner running the food didn't know the tables on the patio and kept taking food to the wrong tables. It took about 25 minutes to get our food. It really was just a lousy experience for a $100 meal. Wouldn't reccomend this place, and won't be back.  Oh, and Ive had better cheese cake at olive garden."
Brittany H.,"Riverside, CA",0,11,6,2.0,5/10/2016,"Went to lunch with my mom and so far it's not very enjoyable. The staff here bypasses you with their speed walking, you basically have to produce smoke signals to be seen."
Michael D.,"Corona, CA",14,2,,2.0,6/12/2015,"Well this is a sad day. I love CKF! However, I don't like getting my drinks after the couple next to me who got here ten minutes after we did. I also don't like not getting my appetizers either. Lastly, the miso salmon was good. But the frozen salmon from Costco tastes twice as good. Gonna have to hit Victoria Gardens or Redondo Beach  next time we want CKF. So sad, one more Riverside/Corona restaurant bites the dust."
Richelle A.,"Corona, CA",236,108,608,3.0,5/30/2015,"After a long day I just wanted to enjoy my dinner with hubs and our little girl. We waited about 10 minutes for a booth and that pretty fast considering it was a busy Saturday night. Our server was ok, I felt like he was forcing himself to try to be nice. Not much of a personality. But anyhow, we ordered the shrimp and chicken jambalaya, Cajun garlic shrimp , and my daughter had the Mac and cheese. No complaints on our meal! Everything was delicious and I love the wheat bread that they serve with your meal. I wanted a slice of banana cheese cake until I saw the price... $8.50 for a slice?! I can always try to make that myself."
Michelle G.,"Riverside, CA",71,64,8,2.0,8/8/2015,"My family and I went to dinner after a dress fitting for my wedding, we put our name in at 8pm and sat down at 8:15. We didn't even get a chance to pay the bill until 10:00!!!!  It started with sitting for 10 minutes before our waitress ever even came to ask what we would like to drink. It was almost at the 30 minute mark when we finally got our drinks (4 sodas and 1 glass of wine) and bread. We put our order in at that point and didn't get our food for another 45 minutes. In all that time we asked three different people for drink and bread refills and our waitress never brought them! We got our house salads and couldn't eat them because they tasted bitter like chemicals, and when we told our waitress about it she said oh that must be the greens, they are bitter. I said no I'm sorry that tastes more like chemicals, something is wrong and she said no problem but still charged us for salads that we couldn't eat! We finally spoke to the manager and she didn't seam to really care. She said the kitchen was backed up but the two tables next to us sat down after us and left before us. That doesn't tell me that the kitchen was backed up. The only reason I am giving it two stars was because the cheesecake was still amazing! Everything else was PRETTY AWFUL!"
Justin P.,"Moreno Valley, CA",171,29,10,4.0,6/10/2016,"Got greeted by a friendly waiter with bread and took our drink order promptly. He brought us water and didn't give us straws. Felt kinda weird, so I had to ask for straws lol the menu is very, very, overwhelming. Every type of food you could think of. Burgers, to enchilada, to orange chicken, even jerk shrimp. Which I got tonight and had to say it was excellent. It says it's very hot, but it isn't, don't be afraid to try it. I recommend the carrot cake cheesecake. If you like carrot cake. It's amazing."
Shaunna L.,"Garden Grove, CA",36,31,7,2.0,4/25/2015,"I'm writing this review at the Yardhouse next door after leaving Cheesecake Factory on a Friday night. Not sure what was going on tonight but this place had the B crew working.  Got our pager, wait was 25 minutes. Sat at bar and ordered drink and appetizer. App arrived and bartender ordered wrong one- no biggie, right? It happens. However, rather than let the food runner know it was ordered wrong she just rang in another one with no sense of urgency and 25 minutes later - no app and pager goes off to be seated. Sat down and waited for our now 30 minute appetizer and it never shows. Got manager involved and he brought it out with his apologies but still no server. And I kid you not, 20 minutes later our dining room server shows up for a drink order. She was so busy in her station- totally what the industry calls ""weeded""  We left- hungry and unhappy- seems like this chain is going downhill- sad because the food quality is always very good. Service needs improving."
J. V.,"Corona, CA",105,170,786,5.0,5/11/2014,"I love this place. For many reasons.. 1. Service always kicks ass  2. I dont have to wait long for a table. 3. Big portion food 4. Cheesecake are quality 5. Ingredients are fresh 6. Free wheat bread  7. My water is always filled 8. Friendly staff, I love smiles.  9. Bathroom are clean. 10. There's always parking spaces."
Gigi R.,"Corona, CA",0,4,1,1.0,1/14/2017,Awful wait experience. There has to be a better wait system in place for larger groups.. Perhaps have the expectation to get larger groups and save an area for those because it's a weekend and a family might want to celebrate their birthdays at your restaurant.
Maria B.,"Moreno Valley, CA",1,84,33,4.0,6/4/2016,Good overall. Wait times can be longer than we would like. Food and service are usually good.
Jacob F.,"Irvine, CA",19,31,,4.0,6/3/2015,"Solid offerings of food at The Cheesecake Factory. The Chicken Madeira is still my favorite of the bunch because I adore wine-based sauces...ohhhh man, love the sides, how the chicken is cooked... Now I really wanna go get some now! The strawberry lemonade is great too and I have to say the bread that comes before your meal....ohh man. I gotta stop myself sometimes before I eat my meal in bread! Solid place!"
Gabrielle T.,"Los Angeles, CA",78,151,160,5.0,8/10/2015,5 stars for Brandy our server! She was awesome- so professional and so personable.  I have never ordered anything except for the Jamaican black pepper shrimp....the 20+ times I've been to CF over the years.  For some reason they brought it with chicken this time. No. Not for me thanks. Brandy set it straight right away and I had a fresh plate in 5 minutes. Yes. Thanks!
David H.,"Carmel Valley, San Diego, CA",290,667,900,3.0,2/17/2013,"I'm not a lover of Cheesecake Factory, but it's okay. Now that I've got that off my checklist of places to try I'll give my honest review. The service was good and our server was attentive and nice. Dinner out for two with dessert is about $50.00 plus tip but can run you more if you add drinks. The portions are rather large and most of the dishes are calorie laden, but they do have a ""Skinnylicious Menu"" with all of their menu items being under 600 calories. But why do people come to the Cheesecake Factory? It's the desserts silly! Most of the cheesecakes and desserts are about $7 to $8 for a good healthy slice of evilness. Mango Keylime Cheesecake, Lemon Raspberry Cheesecake, Pineapple Upside-Down Cheesecake, plus every type of chocolate cheesecake. Oh you are evil with your decadent choices CF.  I had to try the Pineapple Upside-Down Cheesecake. Okay I can die happy now. Food coma time!"
