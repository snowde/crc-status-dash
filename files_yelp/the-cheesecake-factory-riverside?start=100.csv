Jenifer J.,"Riverside, CA",73,31,6,1.0,5/14/2017,"Never again will I go here for mothers day brunch. Even after having a reservation it took 10 mins to get seated, 1 hour to place my order and 45 mins later still didn't have our food. patio seating would've been nice except the bussers were clanking, breaking and dropping dishes constantly in their outside bus area so we couldn't talk either. It was a horrible experience. Eggs were cold and food was forgotten. Manager gave Moms free meals but it still was really bad and still expensive for a horrible experience. Our waitress was nice but that's about it."
Alisa R.,"Winchester, CA",2,130,25,3.0,6/18/2017,"Came here Sat evening around 530. It was busy as usual, but got seated pretty quickly. Our waitress clearly had trouble multi- tasking. Took about 10 mins to greet us, took our drink order, and about 20 mins later 1 of our drinks came out. Still had to wait about 10 more mins for the other drink to arrive. Then placed our order,  with specifics on the salmon dish. It came out not as well done as requested, and lukewarm potatoes and veggies. The food in general tastes good, lacking salt big time last night though. And portions are way too big.   Drinks were tasty as well. Ordered the key lime cheesecake for dessert which was very refreshing and not over tart or sweet.  We've been to this location before,  with no issues, but this time things were obviously a bit unorganized with our waitress."
James T.,"Ontario, CA",0,15,,4.0,6/3/2017,Usually good here. We've had one negative experience when we were seated and not attended to for over 30mins and ultimately left. We gave em a pass that day cuz they were apologetic. Overall good spot to grab dinner.
Goretty L.,"Corona, CA",0,3,4,4.0,1/2/2017,"Aside from the long wait to be seated, our server was really nice. Devyn you da best! Anyway the Cajun jambalaya was so good! And the lunch special pizza and salad with balsamic dressing was just right.  for dessert we got the tiramisu cheesecake, and the pecan something cheesecake... can't remember the name but it's on the specialty page of the cheesecake selections. I really like this location I feel like the staff is much nicer and lets you eat in peace unlike some other locations."
Monica S.,"Riverside, CA",0,2,,5.0,5/29/2017,Came in a couple nights ago and had a great experience! Our server was really nice and helpful. I usually come here every week or so and today was exceptional.
Jay Z.,"Chino, CA",13,232,343,5.0,4/18/2015,"Decided on this place on a Fridate with the fiancé.  He received a $100 giftcard, so why not!  Restaurant was pretty packed about 730, and was quoted 25 min for seating, but we got sat in 15 minutes.  I had every intention of ordering my fave, bistro shrimp, but after perusing the menu, I was swayed to the shrimp scampi and herb crusted salmon combination (comes with mashed potatoes).  Fiancé ordered the steak Diane and herb crusted salmon.  The shrimp and steak were delicious!  As for the salmon, it turned out too ""herby"" for me and I tried to scrape off the herb crust.  We also ordered the Adams cheesecake  and the Kaluha flavor.  Kaluha cheesecake won! Also ordered coffee, which was strong, but delicious.  Our server, Tomas, was excellent! He's the reason this place was bumped up to 5 stars.  Very attentive, friendly (not overly friendly or fake); he made recommendations on dessert. Would go back to this location again!"
Levy S.,"Riverside, CA",1,20,19,1.0,6/9/2017,Wait on the phone 15 min nobody take my order  Then when I came to there I order 2 Salat The lady told me it's gonna be very fast about 10-15 min  I wait there 30 min !!  And on the and also the give me one salat with 2 pack of dressing  And the other one just pack of 1  And I saw that only at home  This one I give them only one star
Adrianne P.,"Corona, CA",2,38,6,1.0,5/7/2017,Never will be returning here again. The service is horrible and slow.  The only thing good about it is is the food.  They brought one plate out at a time for a table of 10 with at least 4 min in between each plate being brought.  Ordered dessert and it took 20 min to come.  Watched many people sit and then get up and leave due nobody acknowledging them.
Gabriela J.,"Riverside, CA",5,75,69,3.0,8/27/2016,"Bad service. I understand that we went on a Friday night, it's packed. But get enough servers. And make sure that they're not just standing around.  We got to cheesecake around 7:20ish, got seated by 7:45. Our server at first was okay, got out drinks took our order,  then we waited and waited and waited. And it wasn't only us, the people around us were also impatiently waiting. It wasn't till 9:15is that we got our food. The food itself was great! As usual it was very good! But horrible service...sorry cheesecake, people expect to wait on weekend but make the entire experience an easy one."
Anthony D.,"Anaheim, CA",30,583,317,5.0,9/11/2016,"Cheesecake gets it right. If they don't, they always make it right. Fresh food, fair prices, and always good service at each location."
Luis V.,"Riverside, CA",164,1,,1.0,1/30/2017,"Good food, terrible service. Came there on Friday 1/27 to Celebrate my birthday with my family. Arrived around 4pm not a terribly busy time, there were people but not a lot. Asked for a table for 5 and was told we'd be seated shortly. While we didn't wait long for our table about 3 parties came in after me with about 3-4 people each and were all seated immediately and ahead of us while we were told to wait. This was the first sign but I gave it a pass as again we didn't have to wait that long.  Finally we were seated and usually the one thing I look forward to when we come here is a fresh basket of bread once we're seated, but we were served nothing. Our server came about 5 mins later and took our drink orders, my mother initially ordered a coke but changed her mind and asked the server if they served hot tea which she promptly replied yes. Now my mother asked if the tea was served per person or by table as some other restaurants do and our waitress seemed completely perplexed. As my mother tried to explain to her what she meant our waitress rudely interrupted her and said and I quote ""You know what let me take their drink orders first"" as she pointed to me and my girlfriend. Even though she was still taking our order she was too impatient to hear out my mother which I found very disrespectful. She took our drink order as well as our appetizer order and we didn't see her for another 10 minutes when she finally brought out the hot water for the tea. But surprise! there was no tea bags to go with the tea. When asked for it she said ""Oh we serve a selection here, let me bring it out for you"" to which she promptly disappeared. After about 20 minutes we hadn't seen her and we haven't even been able to order our main course yet. Finally another waitress comes by with our appetizers and we had to ask her for the tea selection, the bread, and for her to take our order. I'm assuming she was just a food runner but now she had to do all this because our originally waitress wasn't doing her job.  Once the food was all out we enjoyed our time and our original waitress finally came back but then came the next issue. We had 3 plates that needed to be boxed for togo, now I did not know that for Cheesecake factory they will box the food for you so I was surprised when they took our food and boxed it for us. We were given back our food and for the rest of the night we thought nothing was amiss. The next morning when going to heat up our leftovers we come to realize that the we were given the wrong food! We were given someone else's togo order. We called the restaurant and we're transferred to store Manager Chris who promptly agreed to fix the situation if we brought in the mistaken food, sounds like everything's okay now right? Nope! I come in with the food and go straight to the front desk and spoke to I believe her name was Caitlyn, I politely asked her that I came to speak to their Manager Chris and she said ""Okay I'll have someone get him for you."" I stood there for 5 mins and saw her make no notion to signal the manager whom I could clearly see from where I was standing. I went back up to her and asked her again and she acted surprised like she mistakenly misheard me the first time so she asks for my name and tells one of her coworkers named Deedra to go get the manager. Deedra leaves in what I assumed was to go get the manager and she comes back telling me ""He'll be right with you"" so I say okay and I wait...and wait...and wait... 10 mins pass and no manager, after 20 mins of watching Caitlyn and Deedra chatting it up at the front desk I go up to both of them and tell them that this wait is ridiculous and Deedra simply tells me ""Oh he's busy right now"" which I question how she knows since she hasn't left her post in 20 minutes. After over half and hour of waiting I was sick of it and went to the back myself and got the manager because the employee's were to incompetent to help me. And guess what! The Manager Chris tells me that he was never called or told that I was there for him. So not only was I made a fool and waited for over 30mins these two servers Caitlyn and Deedra lied straight to my face. What kind of customer service is that where your employees will lie to your customers face because they're too lazy to do their jobs? The Manager Chris was exceptional and did everything to right the issue, he replaced the food that was mistakenly given to us, gave me free bread and a free slice of cheesecake but I was still extremely infuriated with the service. How does one get 2 straight days of terrible customer service from the same establishment from 3 different people? One person would be on them but when its 3 different people there's obviously an issue with the workplace.  Honestly the food is still delicious and the only reason I would come back, but to whoever reads this be it management or corporate, Deedra and Caitlyn need to be reprimanded for their deplorable customer service. Lying to customers? Sickening"
Mark K.,"Corona, CA",87,150,1106,5.0,1/15/2016,"Just when you think a restaurant couldn't get any better, along comes Derek, possibly the best server we have had since moving to Corona last July!  There's not much more to add to this review considering this late-night decadence has become such a habit, that the wonderful four cheese penne pasta and Caesar salad I ordered should come as no surprise. What did come as a surprise was the outstanding service and on point waiting that was Derek this evening.  Combine that with the consistent quality of the Aforementioned meal, and the result is an easy 5 star experience.  Nailed it again cheesecake factory! See you soon"
Penga P.,"Alaska Range, AK",1,9,2,3.0,7/23/2016,"We ordered pesto pasta with shiritake mushrooms and pasta da vinci with shrimp, waited about 10-12 minutes, wasn't too bad. The service was fast, smooth and the complimentary bread was superb.  When our food arrived, we got extra cheese on top, it looked real good and super moist. I couldn't wait to dig in..but here's the thing- when I had a bite of my pasta da Vinci, it was sooo sweet. After the 3rd or 4th bite my taste buds wanted a different flavor and crunch. My sister got the pesto pasta that they made specifically for her but unfortunately it was super dry! There wasn't enough sauce on it and the mushrooms weren't cooked all the way, so they tasted bitter...the check was about $50. We took it to-go and when we got hungry again later at home, we actually salvaged it with other ingredients and more cheese and it was much better! Nearly perfect. So I'm not sure if it was the chefs fault that day or if that's how they serve their pasta everyday to customers, but I won't be coming back for the pasta. Overall service and cleanliness was great but the taste of the food was mediocre. Giving them 3/5."
Merissa V.,"Perris, CA",122,19,,5.0,2/2/2017,"FOOD IS ALWAYS AWESOME, tamale cakes are always my go to appetizer and follows the fried mac and cheese balls, every server I've ever had (I go her about once a week) has been amazing and lovely and I always have out standing service and they are so personable, they know the menu really well and answer any questions you have :) the pastas are great and I like the steak Diane and colette steak as well, all the cheesecakes are amazing, and the chocolate cakes are great as well, and at the end THEY box up your food for you and it's absolutely so nice of them and it is so greatly appreciated because I suck at that part, I love this Cheesecake Factory !!"
David M.,"Riverside, CA",44,2,,5.0,6/29/2017,Bomb cheesecake and great services  will defently go back. Service is awesome and other other food is teasty.
Bonnie P.,"Jurupa Valley, CA",180,342,83,2.0,7/26/2016,"4 of us had lunch there today---WOW!  not impressed....I ordered Thai Chicken wraps and the chicken (what there was of it) was cremated chunks.  Very UNimpressed. Sent it back with the waitress - a few minutes the manager came by and said ""were you not happy?""   Well gee-of course I was-that's why I sent it back!  He wanted to know if I still wanted a new plate!  GOOD LORD! Got a new plate--overflowing with lettuce, 3 dipping sauces (the first had 2) other assorted vegetables and 4--absolutely no more--tablespoons of chicken Oh-and one of the gals at the table ordered a slice of cheesecake---and said   ""bring 4 forks""--when we all got our separate checks--we had each been charged 1.99 for our ""share"" of the dessert.  the gal who ordered was very embarrassed ---the waitress never even asked if she wanted the charge split among the table (she didn't)  Thanks but no thanks"
Raj S.,"Yorba Linda, CA",0,6,,1.0,9/24/2017,"Poor service, poor service when ordering curbside and poor service on catering orders. They seem to be always under staffed. Yes the food is always great but service at the riverside location is simply always poor. Go to Rancho or try Yardhouse!"
Cynthia A.,"Anaheim, CA",48,55,2,5.0,4/9/2017,"I've been here a few times and the experience has always been just ok. Last night we had Corie B serve us and she was awesome. She was super, gave us her favorites when we asked; we even spoke about makeup and she exchanged compliments with my 16 year old. This is definitely what a great Cheesecake Experience should be about (even tho my husband told her he thought he was at Olive Garden- omg). Btw- if you've never had the tiramisu cheesecake... try it it's amazing!!!!"
JaQuan C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,5.0,6/9/2017,I love the this place when I'm in he area . I always get the lettuce wraps and a couple other apps
Cece M.,"Riverside, CA",0,16,2,3.0,7/19/2016,"This place has gotten worse. Their customer service is ok but the food is not that great. I had ordered salmon and when I got the middle of it, it was Raw!! Their cooks aren't as good as they use to be."
