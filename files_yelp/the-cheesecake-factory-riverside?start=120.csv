Lyn J.,"Corona, CA",122,184,661,5.0,2/29/2016,"Always love my favorite dish! Jamaican Black Pepper Chicken and Shrimp, with a side of black beans and rice, and plantains are the perfect combination that keeps me coming back for more! The drinks I slurped on, had the perfect amount of alcohol in it too."
Wendy M.,"Moreno Valley, CA",1,24,,3.0,8/21/2017,"The food here is good. They have lots of different foods to choose from. They have the best cheesecakes. The service is ok. If you order a burger or any food with avocado be prepared to get 1/10th of avocado. You pay extra for avocado, yet it's so small. They always have long wait lines so be prepared to wait a while before getting seated. Make a reservation if you can."
Cris M.,"Corona, CA",51,15,16,2.0,5/12/2017,By far this time the service was so bad and they sent the manager over who could care less that it took 45 min to get lunch. He even said 30+ min from the time we ordered a burger and a salad. Really??  The burger was super small kid sized almost and he tried to give excuses we had to wait 10 min for mustard and then on the way out I checked and we got overcharged for it. The luau salad is no longer on the menu the suggested replacement fell short on flavor. #cheesecakefactory #fail
Aaron M.,"Riverside, CA",96,141,51,5.0,3/19/2017,"I've only ate in one time. Place is always hopping so I'd recommend making a reservation, though I have no idea if people have to wait long if they don't have on. I get take out and the food is great. Steak Diane and Chicken Bellagio are out go to favorites."
Sophia M.,"Riverside, CA",5,17,9,2.0,3/3/2017,"The hostess called us back to show us to our table, then left us and asked us to wait where we were standing... Then came back to inform us that they had given away our table but she found us another. Then they ran out of stuffed mushrooms. Then they took about 45 minutes to bring our food once we did order. The icing on the cake? They charge an arm and a leg for drinks that aren't priced on the menu. Granted I should have asked, so that is partially my mistake. The food was incredibly greasy too. But our waiter was pretty nice and friendly. He is the only reason I even gave this place a second star. I would never come back."
Lalaland P.,"Perris, CA",79,60,317,3.0,3/29/2017,"Definitely not what I expected. The place is beautiful its clean, and very pinky. The prices are not too high but  not  impressed with the food. I ordered their Chicken bellagio plate it was delicious but small and took too long to arrive. My kids had the pizza from the kids menu it was ok. My daughter had the chicken with mash this was the worse. Her chicken poor thing was flavorless she said mom you can have it. I asked for some lemon and hot sauce to give it some flavor. My husband had a chicken piccata his place was delicious that is what really saved the day. We all pretty much wanted his place. And of course it's called cheesecake factory we had to try their cheese cake so we had a red velvet cake to go and it was yummy. But not so impressed.  I would rather but a whole cake for $15 than pay $8 for a slice. I might go back without my 3 kids this time."
Hugh M.,"Yorba Linda, CA",1,40,27,5.0,4/11/2016,"I visited with my family this past weekend.  It was a very enjoyable experience.  The waitress checked in multiple times to make sure we had full drinks and was quick to explain the lunch/dinner portion dynamics.  And she brought an extra basket of bread to make sure we weren't too peckish. I ordered the Louisiana Chicken Pasta (highly recommended), which came quickly and was coked to perfection.  The chicken was flakey and moist and the pasta was the right level of al dente.  We capped off with a delicious slice of salted caramel cheesecake. It had been a decade or so since my last visit at this location and I can definitely say that they've stepped up their game.  There wasn't a sour note."
Tayler J.,"Corona, CA",36,1,,4.0,1/14/2017,"the restaurant was gorgeous and the food was great. Although the wait was a litte long, the time I had here was awesome. I SUGGEST YOU GET THE BBQ CHICKEN PIZZA!!"
Evelyn S.,"Moreno Valley, CA",0,49,30,2.0,3/22/2017,The food here isnt as good as i remember here i got the fried shrimp platter the fries were tasteless and the cole slaw was soggy my boyfriend got food poisoning from the pasta here i went here on a friday around 8 the service was whatever but the waiting for the food was not worth it $17 dollar plate for it not to be delicious disappointing !
Renee R.,"Covina, CA",0,5,5,5.0,4/24/2017,"The service was amazing! Went last night around 9 and had a waiter named ""Andy"". What  can I say, he was very helpful and nice. He knew everything about GREAT costumer service. Also I was greeted very nicely and friendly by two host. One male and female. I will definitely will be going back sometime soon. I don't even live in Riverside but I'll sure be back. Thank you guys!!!"
R M.,"San Diego, CA",1,60,,5.0,2/20/2017,Came here for Valentine's Day and had an exceptional experience ! Shawna was our server and she was so sweet and upbeat ! We wanted to try something new so we asked her to suggest some dishes for us to try and she suggested a chicken dish and a steak dish and they were both delicious ! We will definitely be back again because of her !
Angela P.,"Moreno Valley, CA",0,165,117,5.0,8/22/2016,"First time customer FOR DINNER and our family enjoyed our food and the service. (We have ordered a slice of cheesecake to go in the past). We ordered  2 burgers, a beef dip, and chicken fingers kids plate. All our meals came with fries.  Fries were nothing special, but that's ok cause the main entree made up for it.  Our server was great; she kept drinks coming and checked on us frequently.  I didn't necessarily like where we were seated but since it was our first visit, I'll know for next time. Don't sit behind the computer where they input ur orders; there's way too much traffic and noise.  Last, it was pricey considering we ordered ""sandwiches/burgers"".  Our total was over $68 without the tip added in.  I'd eat here again, however, I wouldn't go on a random Monday. It would be a special occasion type place for us."
Isela K.,"Riverside, CA",0,34,3,1.0,11/22/2016,Not a happy birthday! My parents wanted to surprise me so they bought a cheesecake and arranged for the staff to sing for me. Sounds nice right well the staff forgot all about it and forgot the cheesecake and everything. I didn't get the surprise my family was hoping for. The staff did nothing to try and fix the situation. We were very disappointed and I do not recommend this place for a birthday dinner.
Miguel S.,"Diamond Bar, CA",15,36,3,1.0,3/27/2017,"Just went in for dinner, out of shrimp summer rolls, asked manager for bread cause our server timothy t. Barely came by & when did he seemed like he was dragging laziness through the whole restaurant and barely asnwer with short answers making me feel uncomfortable. Manager said she will get it, kept seeing her walk by several times, i was wondering whats going on.. And server told me there in the process of making the bread(no more avai.) i was question manager professionalism why couldnt she say domething instead of just have me figure out whats going on.. Worst service ever. Still tipped 20% cause i wanted server to see how there is ppl that would like to appreciate a good service. Never judge a book by its cover."
Valerie R.,"Corona, CA",17,64,4,5.0,2/26/2017,Always crowded. ..but service is always amazing. ..even when I am in a bad mood..jus left ..3 people in front of me for a pick up order. .of course the lady in the front wanted someone to explain alllll the cheesecakes. ....i guess it was the manager who grabbed my food. ..THANKS! !!!!..
Maria A.,"Riverside, CA",0,12,1,5.0,4/12/2017,I love the variety this place provides! They have great service and they are very quick! You might need to wait a bit for the table but it really is worth it! It's also a bit pricy but it is quality food and it really is worth it! It's a great place for a treat!!
Steven M.,"Fontana, CA",0,11,2,5.0,3/22/2017,On 3-22-17 during happy hour I encounter an awesome waiter name Courtney. Very very very professional and love his job and very good at it... I felt like I was eating at a 5 star restaurant in Beverley hills. Thanks for your awesome service Courtney. Need more people in the customer service department like him. Who actually know how to treat customers and make us feel wanted.
Paul W.,"Diamond Bar, CA",0,6,,2.0,3/18/2017,Very disappointed in the service last night. My wife loves the shrimp scampi with extra sauce. So I decided to suck it up and take her even though I am just meh on cheesecake factory. I ordered the shrimp and chicken gumbo. Not a real gumbo plz don't order if youre looking for real gumbo. My wife asked waiter twice for mint and never received it. We had to stack up all our plates to get waiter to eventually notice we were ready to go. Bill was 77 I gave a non existent waiter 10% 7.09 for very minimal service. BTW we ordered two pieces of cheesecake on the way out. Had the waiter attended to us we would have order thru him bill would have been 100 and he would have earned 20 bucks. His lost.
Whitney R.,"Fall City, WA",3,78,,3.0,2/28/2017,I had the salad... It was just ok... The drinks are fab... Great bar and lots to choose from. On vacation for night time they close early
Elisa S.,"Fontana, CA",0,6,2,5.0,8/13/2017,This review is only on the To-go service no complaints the food was ready fast big portions and delicious
