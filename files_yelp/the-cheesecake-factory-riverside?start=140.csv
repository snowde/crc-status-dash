Rachel J.,"Riverside, CA",25,4,2,1.0,3/11/2017,"Giving it one star because I have to. Ordered dinner and expected a wait.... did not expect to finish my meal before my daughter's was just starting to be prepared. After 35 mins of waiting my husbands meal arrived first.... 5 mins later mine came... our daughter's spaghetti and meatballs NEVER CAME. I feel embarrassed for bringing my family here, after along week we were looking for a great dining experience and instead watched our child starve for an hour and a half. Good job to the asshole kitchen staff that sees a kids plate and totally disregards it. I was so angry about the situation I immediately asked for my check, (they're lucky I even paid!) and took what food they did give us and left."
Amber M.,"Yucaipa, CA",1,18,29,5.0,2/20/2017,I love the miso salmon. They sure know how to deliver a great meal with flawless presentation. I love the decor and the service is Fantastic!!! What a huge selection of delicious cheesecake. I can't wait to come back.
Kat H.,"Moreno Valley, CA",6,34,17,4.0,8/10/2016,Love this locationwent for my birthday and customer service is great ! I ordered the Georgia peach cocktail it was so good
Brian A.,"Hemet, CA",1,45,,1.0,3/1/2017,"Ordered the Jamaican ""Spicy"" Black Pepper Shrimp.  Epic fail.  My plate had obviously been sitting out for a while.  The rice was cold.  The black beans had dried out.  The quotes on Spicy are mine.  I guess it was their idea of spicy.   At least the complimentary bread was good, so i filled up on that.   Wanted to order some cheesecake for dessert, but after waiting for the menu for a good 10-15 minutes we decided to leave.  It was 9pm when we got there from picking up family from LAX.  So i guess the staff felt it was time to slack off before closing.  The effort definitely wasn't there.  Past experiences there had been okay, always felt the place was good, but a bit overrated."
Crystal K.,"Riverside, CA",147,20,11,1.0,4/23/2017,"This review is just based on Kelsey B customer service. I ordered a tiramisu cake Togo, and when I got into the car and looked it was half the size that I usually get when I dine in. So me and my boyfriend went back in and spoke to Kelsey( Im pretty sure that's her name that's what I had on the receipt) she explained to us that the Togo packaging is just smaller but the amount is the same. I proceeded to tell her that it's not the box it's the amount of cake it was literally half the amount. She rolled her eyes, grab the bag, tossed it in the trash and started preparing the new piece. The way she was acting was like it was coming out of her pay check, she was huffing and puffing, telling her other coworkers even though me and my boyfriend was still standing there. She just had very irritating manner, even though all I wanted is what I paid for. Please whoever is the manager retrain her because she needs some extra help"
Brenda F.,"Moreno Valley, CA",0,1,,1.0,3/14/2017,"Not a fan, sorry. First timers, ordered starter green salads, was like 90% arugula every bite so bitter on 2nd bite wanted to spit it out :( looked over at hubby and his expression was the same. ( dressing was not even noticable) Most dishes reminded me of tv dinner choices by pics, too much goin on, so I ordered dinner fish n chips, first bite of fish hot grease poured down my chin, wow, didnt get any better, soaked in grease, I ate one of 5: boooo! Hubby ordered classic burger, also highly disapointing, took 2 bites and not another.   no bueno! Mind you we got there super hungry and excited to try C.F., service good, atmosphere great, food very disapointing. Had a 50 g.c. left it at table with 5 dollar balance. Cheesecakes all amazing, should stick to that. All I can say is they have great soda. Blah.HIGHLY OVER RATED PLACE"
Marissa G.,"Redondo Beach, CA",307,567,134,5.0,7/30/2015,"We visited for National Cheesecake Day and took advantage of their takeout service. If you ordered an entree, you got 50% off your cheesecake slices! Last time we visited, the to-go people were incredibly rude and we had to talk to the manager about them. This time, the service was very helpful and friendly. My usual is the grilled chicken and avocado club, which is HUGE and tasty. If you order food to go, they give you bread and butter with your order so you don't miss out!"
Sher G.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",65,5,,2.0,2/19/2017,Friday night zoo time. Came for a birthday and had to wait an hour which is not bad considering. Waited for food way too long. Food was cold or lukewarm and not tasty. Too much money for what we got! Also bathroom was horrendous. Yuck
Mary Y.,"Corona, CA",148,560,365,4.0,8/31/2014,"This is one of my favorite restaurants even though get a bad wrap for serving unhealthy food.  The menu is so long and large, I seriously cannot believe how many food items they serve.  Thankfully, they have a separate lite lunch menu and even mark the items have less fat/calories.  my ALL-Time favorites: asian lettuce wraps + jambalaya pasta w/ the free wheat bread & butter. Not to mention the DIVINE options of cheesecakes. I love love the s'mores cheesecake!! There's plenty of parking since it's connected to the Tyler Galleria mall. I love that I can take my 15 mo. daughter here and the servers cater to her by filling her water and asking if she needs any special food items."
Odie O.,"San Diego, CA",2,1003,63,2.0,4/13/2016,"Like all cheesecake factorys the service is usually very good. Came here twice in a week and both times is was very empty. Second time the lettuce in the salad was old and bad, asked for a new one and it was the same, many rotten pieces, prep cooks must be blind and stoned. We got ceasar instead which was tasty, bit heavy on the anchovies, you need a mint afterwards. I love their melted veggie sandwich and avacado egg rolls."
Shad M.,"Riverside, CA",21,24,15,5.0,1/3/2017,"Food is EXCELLENT! Service is EXCELLENT! My wife and I eat here often and have found out they make everything there, nothing is frozen. We are once at the Brea store and were appalled at how terrible it was. The average employee has been at this restaurant for 10+years."
Ashlei J.,"Riverside, CA",708,46,22,5.0,12/22/2016,"Quick friendly service, plenty of options to choose from, good environment & prime location."
Julie B.,"Carlsbad, CA",18,8,,1.0,4/18/2016,"At first it wasn't bad, only waited 15minutes for seating for 6 people on a Saturday at 3pm. The first table we almost sat at, I notice an extremely dirty set of silverware with something crusty on the handle... Ew. The second table. No water offered when we met the waitress, and yes had to ask her. Food was great, if we actually had gotten the first half that was taken away in our bag of boxed food. To of the cheesecakes paid for to go, weren't in there, and also half the food that was asked for to go. It was already too late since we had already left.  Not my best experience at a Cheesecake Factory, and maybe my last."
Juliet E.,"Menifee, CA",352,98,6,5.0,1/1/2017,"Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite corporate chain restaurants. They have fantastic food, profesional staff, and very clean area. I like this location specifically, because they make the drinks really strong haha! I highly recommend the chicken pot stickers for an appetizer and any of the burgers there are to die for. Expect a wait, this place is always extremely busy."
Chloe S.,"Carson, CA",0,9,1,1.0,10/8/2016,"This is the worst Cheesecake Factory I ever been too. I stepped out with my girls tonight to celebrate tonight and the service from beginning to end was horrible. The waiter had an attitude because we were taking back our food wasn't right. One plate we order was a burger and the meat was bleeding red and we took it back twice. At that point we didn't care. Then another plate we ordered was a shrimp scampi and the shrimp batter was doughy. Then our dessert , was the Godiva chocolate brownie sundae , it was soooo hard and extra extra chocolate syrup drowning it . It was just bad !!!"
Vero M.,"Riverside, CA",0,1,,2.0,7/9/2017,"Today's experience was not so good. Getting seated to our table was quick. No wait time. Once we were seated and ordered our food, there was about an hour until we finally got our food. My husbands food was brought out first and i had to wait another 10 mintues until my food was brought out.Waitress was very nice and polite and apologized for the wait. While we waited for our food we noticed that when the tables and seats were getting cleaned up, the same rag is used. Well the silverware is placed directly on the table without placemat or napkin. I was very disappointed and I will not be back to this location."
Jayden S.,"Upland, CA",196,30,20,5.0,12/9/2016,"After finding a parking spot on a very busy Friday and having no luck with wait times at other restaurants. We came in here knowing it'd be busy but quick. We were greeted by two kind and upbeat hosts, even though they were very busy they were quick and let us know the wait time (30 Minutes, on a Friday, is great!). We hopped over to the bar and were greeted by Jin who was also busy mixing, pouring and cleaning and making a great atmosphere with everyone at the bar, regulars and new guests. We ordered drinks and appetizers while waiting and hung out waiting for a table. Jin was quick to refill and make sure everything was good and updated on anything we needed and reassured our orders would be quick. After we started in on the food we decided we liked the bar better and Jin was happy to pass along our table buzzer and keep dinner coming, which was also excellent. We've been here before and have had equally great experiences, but Jin was over the bar of excellence and made the night seem like we're there every week. We will definitely be looking for him again."
Sara L.,"Riverside, CA",0,5,,1.0,7/17/2017,"Service is horrible, food is okay but over priced. I'd rather spend less money on a descent portion vs spending too much on enough food for three people. The cheesecake is also not worth 8 dollars a slice."
Rese G.,"Riverside, CA",35,4,,4.0,7/7/2016,Lemon Pasta Chicken is the main dish i love here. Recommended for dinner. Heavy traffic on weekends but the staff are friendly.
David S.,"Riverside, CA",3,60,8,2.0,3/11/2016,"Excellent food but very overpriced...lunch was delicious (wife had bowtie pasta with chicken, sister had bowtie pasta with Chicken Marsala, Ihad the battered fish tacos, and we all shared the Cuban spring rolls which are outstanding). Great service. My only beef and its an important one because this is The Cheesecake Factory is that we ordered just 1 piece of cheesecake to go because we were too full and had to have one. We didn't open the box until we got home...forgot what we paid ..either $7 or $8 for a slice...the slice was the size for a baby...absolutely ridiculous.....like 3-4 bites....sorry guys, you blew it with the portion of your cheesecake.....really bad."
