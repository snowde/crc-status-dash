Andrew O.,"La Quinta, CA",84,11,1,2.0,2/20/2017,"Service was okay, not great, the waitress had to many tables to attend to that I felt neglected. In the hour I was there only received one refill. If that wasn't bad enough I've used porta potty's that were cleaner than the restroom there...."
None Y.,"Riverside, CA",0,8,1,1.0,4/20/2017,"Horrible ! My steak was raw af and made me throw up they rushed us and didn't even cook the food right, food poisoning to the fullest! Don't come to this Cheesecake Factory the food is a huge disappointment."
Jeff H.,"Riverside, CA",43,24,61,1.0,3/20/2016,"Last time we were here foods were so so but bench, table, menus and utensils were so dirty. So, we decide to come back and give another try! We were called in to be seated less than five minutes. As we were walking to our seats there were good crumbs on the bench and a left over pink sweetener wrapper. Hostress didn't even apologize. Utensils were not clean at all, we have to use lemon wedges to clean them. Waitress came by late for the breads and butters. Foods were not to standards so we had to pack home.  Overall, we are not coming back anytime soon. Mangers, upper managers and CEOs do something about your managements!!!"
Madie N.,"Riverside, CA",224,179,813,4.0,5/30/2015,"My mom and I had a great time at the Cheesecake Factory. We decided to try the skinny menu tonight and we were not disappointed. We splurged on the crab wontons though and those were delish. I ordered the ahi carpaccio because, let's be honest, I love anything that has raw tuna in it and it was really good! The cucumbers on the side were pickled and went well with the dish. My mom ordered the steak medallions and she liked the way her steak was prepared, but she said the potatoes beneath the steak could have been a little more creamy.  We took home 2 slices of cheesecake- cherry and Oreo- that the rest of the family will enjoy."
Melanie B.,"Riverside, CA",9,26,35,2.0,11/13/2015,Two stars given for the nice waitress we had and I can't recall her name but the food was horrible!  My husband and I ordered the Steak Diane and herb salmon their steak was small tiny pieces of meat that was red when I asked for well done it was more mushrooms than steak on the entire plate was mashed potatoes my piece of salmon was smaller than the palm of my hand! I'm so upset bc I could have went to pf changs Which is right next door compared to this horrible meal I had! I worked all week and just wanted a delicious meal turned bad.... The wait wasn't bad and again my server was good but that meal I would have preferred mc Donald's!
Joe M.,"Keeler, CA",0,84,40,4.0,11/16/2016,"Checked this place out for lunch cuz we had a gift card. Had tried the Rancho Cucs location b4 and we had never been back. Much better service and the food was pretty good too! We had the Mac n cheese (fried balls) and beet n goat cheese salad for our apps. The MC was to die for, and only my wife loved the salad. For lunch I got the bacon bacon burger and my wife tried the steak Diane with Shrimp scampi combo. My burger was perfect. I chose the usda choice beef and not the Kobe. Loaded with bacon and perfectly cooked. Unfortunately, the steak Diane did not meet the same expectation. Shared the red velvet cheesecake for desert which was also just ""ok"". Except for all the flies flying about the resturaunt, our lunch today wasn't all too bad."
Mychelle R.,"Corona, CA",17,35,68,2.0,10/24/2016,"Great food as always but a lil disappointed in my service.  Ok, I usually get avocado egg rolls so today I see these shrimp summer rolls, so I point them out to the server and ask how are they because I may try something different, he told me they were good if I liked seafood but there's also an egg roll sampler so after seeing what types of rolls were on the sampler I told him I'd go with the summer rolls n crab bites, my son had red velvet cheesecake all were very good.  I asked for a take out for my 2 rolls n 2 bites and packed them. Now my bill comes and my rolls are $11.95 but the menu said $7.95 so I brought it to my servers attention and he says oh those are the skinnylicious I gave you the other because you get less on those and I didn't know you wanted those, I replied but I showed you on the menu, he said I'm sorry.  So I asked for a manager in the mean time I look at the regular menu and it has Vietnamese shrimp summer egg rolls $11.95 so the manager comes and I explain and she tells me well they're the same it's just the ones I wanted has less and one sauce. I said well he didn't tell me or ask which, but I did show him the skinnylicious ones, she said well did you eat all of them, a lil shocked I said no and opened my lil box and showed her my 2 rolls and remaining bites.  Lol, she said well I'll change it but I'll need to take those 2 rolls, I couldn't believe it, not my mistake and the rolls had crab bite crumbs on them, she said you wanna put those in the box with your bread, wow really.  Needless to say I was appalled at how she handled this situation but I didn't hold that against my server and still left him a nice tip BECAUSE he was far more courteous than his manager."
Sarah S.,"Murrieta, CA",3,23,35,5.0,7/23/2015,"$$ Delicious. Only one gluten free cheesecake--chocolate Godiva--very rich! Good for sharing. Can't eat it all in one sitting. There are a few gluten free pasta items. I have only tried the gluten free falle chicken roasted garlic but I liked it so much I keep ordering it. The dinner pasta (not lunch) is very large, enough for two people. I'd like to try the eggplant one though.  As always, make sure to inform the staff if you have an allergy/celiac so that they can let the manager and chefs know. They are very good about handling it without creating a scene."
Peter P.,"Los Angeles, CA",13,77,33,4.0,3/18/2015,"(Vegetarian review) Nice looking place, good service (our waitress was very dear) and ok food... But AWESOME cheesecake! I gotta say, the veggie burger was an epic Fail. The patty was flavorless. Yes, it's huge but like many Americans prefer quantity over quality, I don't. If you are vegetarian and you come here to try out the burger, DON'T.  The cheesecake was absolutely amazing. Totally worth the money and every single bite is cheesecake heaven. Overall? Coming back to try a different dish but definitely coming back for that cake."
Lanae A.,"Riverside, CA",249,1,,5.0,11/10/2016,ASK FOR ANDREW!!! Best waiter hands down!!! Went above and beyond for us and never left us waiting! He suggested the hibachi steak and it was so delicious! He made our visit well worth it. Great service fast service and warm  and welcoming!
Becky S.,"Oklahoma City, OK",130,205,92,1.0,7/14/2016,"The service was just not good. Our server had a strong accent and spoke really fast and never looked at us in the eyes when asking questions. He would make a comment and then walk away so we couldn't answer. My Cesar salad came with iceberg lettuce & when I asked why he said ""all Caesar salads come like that"" all smirky. Well, sorry sir but I've been eating Caesar salad religiously for a long time and it always comes with romaine."
Aeen H.,"Riverside, CA",0,10,6,3.0,7/9/2016,"We went here last night, they seated us fairly quickly, the food was perfect as expected. But our waiter was a joke. My husband and I play a game we add $1 to the waiters tip every time he comes to our table to check on us. Our waiter last night literally got $3. Once for the drink order, next to take our food order and last to give us our check. Pretty bad, because more date nights we have ranged from $10-$15"
Christina C.,"Riverside, CA",134,39,31,4.0,4/1/2016,"This place is always very busy, but so worth the wait! So my children and I had a blast, ate nachos, buffalo wings, burgers and  ! Needless to say we are stuffed. Everything was cooked to perfection!We took our cheesecakes to go. The service was great, seating is comfy and atmosphere is great!!"
Britney M.,"Big Bear Lake, CA",217,625,1057,2.0,12/23/2014,"The food really wasn't all that great. We ordered nachos, with sour cream on the side. They forgot to bring us the sour cream, and decided not to put guacamole on there. For the meals we ordered the fried Mac and cheese, fried zucchini, and the large ceasar salad. The fried Mac and cheese had a weird tasting batter, almost burnt tasting. The zucchini was good, but the ranch did not taste right. The Caesar salad was huge!!! Loved the portion size, but.... The dressing was really bad. It ruined the salad. Had a funky taste. Overall there dressings tasted weird, definitely not traditional ranch or Caesar. Making your own dressing is great, ""homemade"" style at restaurants, but it doesn't work out if the dressings don't taste right. Would not order any of these dishes again."
Brett C.,"Riverside, CA",1,62,46,1.0,8/4/2016,"Tried this restaurant again after years of not coming here. I would still go elsewhere. Our party ordered the hot spinach and cheese dip, eggroll sampler, cajun chicken littles, and shrimp with angel hair. The food here is not for those looking for a balanced meal. The spinach and cheese dip was a bowl of spinach and oil with parmasian cheese sprinkled on top. The shrimp with angel hair was covered in oil. The eggrolls and chicken littles were sitting in oil. I had these items in other retaurants and never did it have as much oil as here. The only time i would ever come back to cheesecake factory is to get a slice of cheesecake."
Shawn S.,"Beaumont, CA",0,5,1,5.0,2/20/2017,"The experience my wife and I had at the Cheesecake Factory in Riverside was beyond amazing. We had the privilege of dining with the help of Courtney Davis, a member of the Cheesecake Factory Staff. He was excellent. Not only did Courtney help us to have the best experience possible, he took notice of the little things. Sometimes those little thing are what matters the most. Courtney really made sure that he did everything in his power to give us EXCELLENT service! He checked on us, made sure our drinks stayed full, he thought ahead to see what we might possibly need and took care of that as well. He also helped us to cope with the fact that the Hibiscus Lemonade was being removed from the menu and made sure that my cup always had that drink in it at all times. Courtney went above and beyond anything we could have wanted and needed. He is a very genuine, sincere, and respectable man. And it was our honor to enjoy a meal at the Cheesecake Factory. Thank you Courtney Davis!"
Krishna T.,"Corona, CA",16,5,12,5.0,5/14/2016,Had an excellent time with my hubby....After long time loved my Long island tea  Though it being a Saturday evening and very busy our servers Melissa and Autumn we're the best ...they always checked on us every few minutes and were good on refills of the bread basket....Autumn suggested me their Godiva cheesecake and boy its to die for....I was so full with all the appetizers and food but couldn't help myself to stop.....
Mel C.,"Las Vegas, NV",237,1503,8255,4.0,7/17/2013,"Out in California with the boss and guess what?  He wants to treat me out to lunch. Because I've been trying to eat clean lately, our obvious pick had to be Cheesecake Factory.  Ha! For those that been to a Cheesecake Factory before, the menu hasn't changed much, and because we came during lunch, there also wasn't much of a line. Actually none at all.  Service was good as usually and we had a very attentive server. She gave us recommendations that fit our needs. I opted for something off their Skinnylicious menu, which is their version of a lite menu.  The Skinnylicious menu consist of smaller servings, lower fat, lower calorie, and higher protein meals.  What I found funny was that the lowest calorie meal was between 440-490 calories.  Isn't that high, especially if you're eating between 6-8 meals per day?  It's all relative and I ended up with just a cup of brown rice, broccoli, and salmon (no seasoning).  Meal was fairly tasty, but not much was expected since I had it plain. At least my fish was flaky. Overall, I still recommend Cheesecake Factory when you're looking for a meal with huge portions.  If you're looking for something with less calories, don't forget that even a place named Cheesecake Factory has a lower calorie menu."
Mary L.,"Corona, CA",0,52,23,2.0,9/6/2016,I loved going to this cheesecake factory until today today I took out my mom for her birthday it was me my 2 sisters and my mom our waiter named Katie was not the greatest she was not polite at all we all got the impression that she just doesn't like her job or she was having a bad day it took about 20 minutes for us to get our food we kept on asking her for refills and napkins things that we never ask for I mean other severs have always been great We also went on slow Hrs I'm talking about 1 PM when this place is pretty dead What made me and my sisters even more upset is that we told her we were celebrating my birthday they usually sing you happy birthday which is why we went in the first place and give you a  piece of cheesecake or a little treat this Katie server totally forgot Or was just in another world! How disappointing
Galvan R.,"Long Beach, CA",23,2,,1.0,5/3/2017,"So we came for my wife's birthday to have dinner. It took forever just to get our drinks. Once we ordered our food, service was horrible. They brought my wife the wrong plate, my son ordered steak well done and it was so bloody it taste like water. I also ordered the steak but my plate never made it out. When I asked about it, my family was already done eating and it was also bloody and had all the wrong sides. We never got refills on our drinks, they never did anything about my son steak that he took 2 bites of. My steak was returned back to the kitchen and was forgotten about again...they still had the nerve to bring me a 90 dollar check... we will never be returning to this greasy horrible place and am planning on getting a hold of there corp. for a full refund..."
