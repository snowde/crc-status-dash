Andy L.,"Alhambra, CA",49,29,3,2.0,1/8/2017,"Came in around 6:20 for dinner and got seated at 7:00. Ordered food around 7:30 and currently writing this review at 8:21, and no food has appeared on our table. Our server is now where to be seen and has only checked up on us once. I have never waited so long for food at any of the other Cheesecake factory's. Would not come again."
Kim O.,"Corona, CA",190,313,2282,1.0,10/7/2015,"Wow! Where do I even start with this review. .... 1- I finally agree with my fellow Yelper's, about corporate owned restaurants.  The quality is definitely on a downward spiral.  2- called ahead to make sure that they did not have a long wait time to be seated because of limited time.  3- Got seated right  away a little pass noon. 4 - Greeted by our sweet waitress right away 5- Ordered their Fire Roasted artichokes as a appatizer  6- Tried to order a few of our favorite dishes that are NO LONGER on the menu... Seasoned salmon salad & Carmel Chicken  7- Ordered our lunches, Asian chicken wraps & bun less WELL DONE cheeseburger UNSALTED  & all produce on the side 8- While pulling apart the artichoke, realized it's half Roasted & Half FROZEN  9- Emeditly tried to send it back after a few minutes of tracking down my waitress & finally settled on a bus boy to please bring her to my table 10 - the waitress asks if I want them to continue to cook the one that's pulled apart or bring me out a whole new dish..... huh , yes , bring me a new order 11- Manager comes over to apologize,  I say absolutely understand fluke mistake. .. still I'm smiling  12- Brings out a perfectly fire roasted one... YUM 13- Brings out the asian chicken wraps.... YUM 14 -Brings out plate with a plain burger patty with a thick slice COLD cheese in a bowl .... WHAT???? 15- Close to 1pm and STARVING  16- Get my waitress attention... Hello why is my cheese cold & in  separate bowl? Omg! I'm sorry they messed up back in the kitchen. I say DON'T WORRY I'M STARVING, I'LL EAT IT AS IS.  She apologizes  : ) 17 - Burger patty looks well done , continue with my conversation with my daughter while I'm cutting into what I thought was a WELL DONE BURGER .... NOPE NOT  WELL DONE , MEDIUM.  18- Call waitress over again, says AGAIN I'm sorry. I'm so hungry at this point I say... Please just finish of my original patty on the grill because I'm starving and have plans 19- Again same Manager comes to the table to apologize.... at this point I'm getting delirious /annoyed and just want the meal I ordered and get OUT OF THERE. 20- Brings out the correct meal that was ordered over a hour previously  21 - Plan's get canceled call my other daughter to just come there and order her food for take-out  because our quick lunch has now stretched over a hour half. 23- Might as well order cheesecake since our original plans are IMPOSSIBLE.  24-  Almost 2 hours into our Nightmare lunch the Manager comes back to say "" Your burger is on us today "" REALLY!!!!  How about the fact that both my girl's value their days off!? you've ruined our plans!? How about the fact that your a restaurant & NOT a prison but i felt as though i just served 3-5yrs!?. ...  FINALLY able to Break Free of your pleasant dining experience. .....  I felt like screaming at the top of my lungs ... FREE AT LAST!!!!! By far worst dining experience!  2 HOUR'S TOTALLY  wasted.... ; ("
Reyna J.,"San Bernardino, CA",74,28,749,5.0,11/8/2015,I've  been to this cheese cake factory  over 5 times. It's my grandparents favorite place to eat . Everyone is always so friendly . They have the best steaks! My personal favorite  is the flemon mignon  steak.  I truly wouldn't waste my time going to a fancy steak house. If your looking for a good steak the cheese factory is the place to go :]
Dave W.,"San Diego, CA",1,172,,4.0,3/19/2017,"Been a while since a Corporate Chain restaurant got a good rating from me, Everything was near perfect. Service was great, Sat on the Patio on a beautiful day, what more could you ask? Price are fair, Portions are huge."
Kaylin O.,"Los Angeles, CA",219,887,306,4.0,1/19/2016,"I've gone to this particular location a few times.  Service has been great most of the time I've been there. I usually order my favorite entree, Chicken Piccata.  I also order an extra side of sauce to go with my pasta.  They don't charge you for it.  I love their pumpernickel breads too!  This particular location gets pretty busy even on a weekday."
Barbie T.,"Yorba Linda, CA",217,3,5,1.0,12/22/2015,I've never really came to cheese factory before so I decided to give it a try and come to find out wasn't impressed at all. When I sat down the silver wear was super dirty definitely grossed me out because it wasn't just on one but all.  Wasn't impressed with the food either. I rather much go to yard house. Last time I'll ever come here
Nikki W.,"Costa Mesa, CA",3,99,35,1.0,5/22/2016,I don't have anything good too say about this Cheesecake Factory other than the bathroom a was clean. Came here the other day for my sisters bday lunch and we had ab 15-20 ppl their. I ordered the chicken avocado sandwich and the first bite in it was good. Than second bite I look down and there's a long string of black hair in my food! GROSS!!!!!! So I let the waitress know that theirs hair in my food and immediately says she will tell the mngr and asks if I'd like anything else. Of course I say no cuz I've lost my appetite. Something ab hair in my food isn't appetizing sorry! Than the mngr comes out too talk to me but none of that matters cuz idc about 10 mins later my friend had ordered a burger and while she's eating she finds a piece of wax paper in her burger. Like really come on Cheesecake Factory get it together! Needless to say. I won't be back too this location!
Cristian M.,"Corona, CA",54,2,,2.0,6/26/2016,"Me and my gf came here about a week ago for the first time at this location, the wait wasn't so bad prob around 15 minutes. The hostess was super nice sat us down. Everything was great until the waiter who was this older white lady served us. I Asked her if she can do half the sliders with cheese and the other two without since my gf is lactose intollerent. She gave me attitude and said she wasn't sure I'm that's possible. She would rarely check in on us to see if we needed water and the food took about 35 minutes. I'm not one to complain but geez it's been a while since I've had customer service this bad."
Lynnann W.,"Irvine, CA",23,149,95,5.0,10/2/2015,Violeta M (pretty name) was exceptionally attentive.  Order was perfect.  Food delicious.  Realize it is a chain restaurant but her service sets it apart!  Bravo for having this caliber of employee!!!  I'll be back for sure... Can you request servers?!  Lol.
Bruce C.,"Sun City, CA",0,25,17,5.0,10/4/2016,Love the chessecake factory. Cant go wrong ordering anything of there menu. But you must try the chicken and biscuit its almost like a chicken pot pie but tastier.
Rochelle S.,"Moreno Valley, CA",33,94,205,4.0,1/10/2016,My absolute favorite is the crispy crab wontons. Simple yet delicious and the sauce compliments the dish perfectly. The kids butter and parmesean bowtie pasta won my daughter over. Wait time was 15mins on a Sunday which isn't bad at all.
Ana C.,"San Francisco, CA",2,208,115,5.0,2/14/2017,"I like cheesecake factory, and the waiter Monica was really sweet.  They had great foods and good.  Even the wait was long in Valentine's day, but cheesecake factory still our number one choice for special day!"
Ann P.,"Los Angeles, CA",33,18,2,5.0,5/16/2016,"Cheesecake factory review Mother's day 5/8/16  Mother's day the choice was 'Let's do take out"" The idea of waiting beyond an hour for a table was just not an option for us. I called into my favorite spot at Tyler mall.  Without writing a book, I will give you a short story. I realize Mother's day is the busiest day of the year for restaurants, and it is so easy for things to go array. I drove from Beaumont and decided to call and place an order for three dinners and an appetizer.  Yes, Palm Springs is closer but the food is hands-down superior at the Tyler mall location!  When I arrived, it was a packed house with standing- room only and more folks outside.  Allison, was very friendly and professional, greeted me with a warm smile. I gave her my name and asked if my orders were ready for pick up.  Allison replied, ""Yes your order is right here"". Talk about timing, we did not have to wait even two minutes. My heart went out to those who looked like they had camped overnight.   Upon arriving home my Mom, stepdad and sister were delighted with their selections. Steak Diane & Shrimp Scampi, Chicken Madeira, Center Cut chops, Appetizer (Meatballs). The presentation of the dinners was spot on and the taste Fantastic & delicious!  However, my appetizer was less than satisfactory.  Cheesecake factory has always been one of my favorite places to dine, but somehow something went very wrong.  Normally I go on Yelp and do a review but my thoughts were no way can I badmouth my favorite place. I will go in and speak with a manager the first chance I get.  Well, it just so happened that my mom wanted to return on Wednesday and pick up two dinners. Yes, the same two she had on Mother's day.  When we walked in Cynthia greeted us with a warm smile and took our order. I asked if a manager was available to speak with me. Cynthia said, ""Yes he is right here"". I introduced myself and explained what took place with my order on Sunday.   Right away Joe, the manager apologized for the mishap and said he would like to make things right for me. He comped me an order of meatballs to go. Joe and the chef came out smiled and waved at us as we were leaving.  I told Joe that I would be going on Yelp and leaving a review. I appreciate the kind service that I received.   My hectic schedule prevented me from writing this review the same day, Wednesday 5/11. I had a free moment and thought now is the time! I jumped online and called the restaurant to ensure that I had remembered the correct name. Joe or John, this is what I get for not writing it down right away.  A charming sweet voice answered ""Cheesecake Factory may I help you"" It turned out to be the GM, Diane; we talked for about 20 minutes or more. I feel Blessed that she took the time to speak with me and understand my concerns. I am confident that Diane will make certain that her staff is in accord with Cheesecake Factory standards & procedures.  Thank you to Allison, Joe (manager), Chef, Cynthia and Diane (GM). You are wonderful and I do appreciate your efforts in turning my experience around. Cheesecake Factory continues to be my top favorite!  Sincerely  Chef Ann"
Sue H.,"Temecula, CA",32,15,9,4.0,8/23/2015,"I read the bad reviews posted prior to our arrival, I admit I was leery about going here, but since I didn't choose it I just ""went with the flow"".  I'm glad I did, we were here on a Wednesday afternoon, at noon-thirty, and it was a bit of a wait.  They sat us down, and one of our group asked if we could be seated elsewhere, they moved us, all very pleasant, no attitude or making us feel bad, felt kinda special actually :)  We all ordered salmon, and it was PERFECTLY cooked, which I don't get to say too often, so yay.   Pleasant perfection, thanks ??, I'm so sorry I can't remember our waitress' name, but she was great!"
Jennifer S.,"Corona, CA",37,11,6,5.0,8/18/2015,"My hubby and I went on a double date with close friends and we had already had a late lunch so we weren't too hungry.  However we were happy that they had a ""Small Plates"" option in the menu & I ordered a delicious greek salad, leaving room for desert. The waitress was great and suggested the Smore's Cheesecake & I was sooooo glad I ordered it.  My mouth is watering right now as I write this review.  It is by far the most delicious cheesecake I have EVER had in my life lol."
David D.,"Riverside, CA",0,6,2,1.0,2/26/2017,"Bad experience today. Came here to celebrate my wife's and nephews birthday. We knew it was going to be busy and we were going to have to wait which was fine. We waited more than 15 min for the hosted to tell us how long our wait would be, I had to go ask a manager if he could inform me of the wait time. Our server took our order but when it came out it was all wrong. We had to send the birthday girls food back since it was wrong and it took over 15 for them to bring it back correct. By that time we had all finished eating our meal. We had never had this bad of an experience in the past here. Not sure what is going on"
Nicole W.,"Corona, CA",429,19,27,5.0,7/7/2016,We had a great experience. Service was on point and good as delicious. We defiantly left full and satisfied.
Kimberly J.,"Norco, CA",148,53,392,4.0,2/23/2016,"Cheese cake Factory... Great selections.. Georgia Peach drink awesome... Meat loaf good, clam Chowder good... Grill cheese good... BUT my Chicken chipotle pasta: NOT that good..."
Mary L.,"San Bernardino, CA",230,110,103,4.0,7/21/2015,"I love this place. The food is never disappointing. My favorite there is the Habachi steak, it's merely delicious! The sliders there are rather moist and juicy, abundant with flavors! The decor is so elegant and it's always a good time!"
Terrance S.,"San Diego, CA",4,56,7,4.0,1/3/2016,"It's been a few years since I was last at a Cheesecake Factory, and the one on Tyler Road was a solid restaurant to get back into the groove.  Prices were as I'd remembered them, and we were seated quickly. It took a little longer than I'd expected to get our bread, but it was hot and fresh.  Shout out to our server, Tyler, for his friendliness and outstanding customer service.  We started out with the quesadilla; it, too, was hot and fresh and delicious. She ordered the Carolina pulled pork sammich, and I opted for the crispy spicy chicken sammich.  She didn't feel like it was pork that was pulled properly.  My sammich was outstanding, but my fries were lukewarm at best.  Overall, not a bad experience. A fine welcome back of sorts."
