Alex W.,"Alhambra, CA",137,17,6,3.0,6/19/2016,"This Cheesecake Factory location has many strong points to show for. Having been here a few times, here is my feedback on my overall experience here: WAIT TIME: It depends on if you're coming in for lunch or dinner but expect wait times of approximately 1 hour to 1.5 hours during dinner hours and wait times vary for lunch hours. On one occasion, I came during lunch and the wait time was shorter than 5 minutes while on another occasion a dinner wait time was almost an hour and a half. INTERIOR: The setting is cordial with a dim light setting. The seats and tables are of a decent size however they generally tend to be on the intimate and smaller side in size. Floors and general areas are clean.The restrooms can get messy quickly on busier days. SERVICE: Great service and attentive to refilling drinks or bread. FOOD: Great quality and consistent between pasta, pizza or burger options as far as taste and flavor go. The dishes are relatively balanced and aren't over or underflavored.  I would recommend this location if you're looking for a small or larger group spot to have a meal at. Prices are a better bargain if you can make it to their lunch specials and dinner prices for most plates are around $15 or so."
Mileena M.,"Westminster, CO",5,24,17,3.0,11/23/2015,"I haven't had Cheesecake Factory in years, but I always remembered the Oreo being my favorite. This time, I ordered the Carrot Cheesecake, and it was just a little too sweet and rich for my taste. I wish the cheesecake part was a little more dominant and less cream cheese frosting. It was good, but I would not order it again."
Tim R.,"Riverside, CA",34,48,103,2.0,4/18/2015,"Went there to celebrate our 12 year anniversary.  Ordered the fried catfish and my wife ordered the shrimp and chicken jumbalia.  She liked her dish, however, my green beans and corn were Luke warm, my mashed potatoes were cold and hard.  After all that, the catfish was raw...seriously, my meal was crap.  Manager took care of it so that was nice, still put a downer on the anniversary dinner.  Won't be back unless it's for cheese cake and coffee."
Will H.,"Corona, CA",16,211,,1.0,3/6/2015,"Flush with my $25 Christmas gift card, I walked into this location at 4 p.m....right at the beginning of Happy Hour.  Thus, my $25 was good for 5 of the $5 Happy Hour appetizers.  I added in a Happy Hour $5 Margarita and I was all set for a feast. Unfortunately, as on previous visits, there were several issues that made for a less than cool dining experience: 1. I requested a strawberry margarita instead of a regular one and was told it would be $5 extra.  WHAT?  Never have I been to any bar where they charge more than $1 extra (if any) for strawberry.  After all, it is only 25 cents worth of strawberry puree spooned into the glass/blender.  In fact, at On the Border and Lonestar Steakhouse, that same Happy Hour Strawberry Margarita Is only $3.....SO, how in the world can Cheesecake Factory possibly justify $10 for theirs?? Something is big time wrong here, and the server never bothered to call over the manager, despite my protests. 2.  On to the food:  With 5 different items ordered, it would seem logical that the server would tell the kitchen to perhaps send 1 out every 8 minutes, which would have been ideal.  BUT, I'm sure this never happened and she failed to tell the kitchen that all 5 items were for ONE person.  SO, what happened was an eating nightmare:  My yummy artichoke came out and then 1 minute later, 3 more plates arrived, and a few minutes more an a plateful of sliders arrived as my dessert.  I waited 15 minutes for the mustard and mayo for the latter, but it never arrived.....Food was so-so, but most was COLD by the time I got around to trying it.   No discount, no comps, and no manager anywhere to be seen.  WHY?  Just a total waste of my nice $25 gift card."
Bob A.,"Moreno Valley, CA",20,19,25,3.0,6/10/2015,"Came here today after a school award ceremony.  As we walk in the host was stressed and not friendly. Which normally the host is the most friendliest person in the place. Even thought she said a 30 min wait  we got seated promptly. Our server was nice she was busy but she did the best to her ability to take care of us. Service was not as we usually get but i think it was because of all the high school graduations.  Food is good, by far their best dish is the orange chicken and the sweet corn tamale cakes."
Marcie R.,"Riverside, CA",30,94,323,5.0,3/31/2014,"Love their food, especially the fire roasted chile rellanos....and for only $5.95 it's a deal! Also love the bellagio chicken."
Shaundra P.,"Corona, CA",0,2,,1.0,9/22/2016,This Cheesecake Factory has the worst customer service I've ever experienced! They are very slow. It took nearly 40 minutes to get our food! The food was burnt and of course it was cold by the time it reached our table. The manager was not helpful at all.
Cynthia S.,"Chicago, IL",34,274,794,5.0,7/6/2014,Always love Cheesecake Factory. Did ours to go today. Food was hot and very good. Cheesecake great as usual. Fast and friendly service
Denise B.,"Riverside, CA",7,13,13,4.0,2/8/2015,"Love this restaurant get great service 80% of the time but this Friday at lunch while paying my bill and I'm not sure if this is every CKF or just the one in Riverside, ca. They are deceiving us all on our checks! If you notice at the bottom of your check the have a handy  area at the bottom ""SUGGESTED GRATUITY""  to help some people figure out your tip for your bill. It has a guggested amount for leave your server 15%  18%  or 20% well if you really figure it out, like I did, it is WAY OVER WHAT IS TRUE! For instance my bill came to $25.60 and my suggested gratuity listed was at 20% $10.24 but really should be $5.12 - 18% they have $9.21 but really should be $4.61 - 15% they have $7.68 and should be $3.86. So check for yourself people they are ripping you all off! SHAME ON YOU CHEESE CAKE FACTORY"
Sofia P.,"San Bernardino, CA",488,5,,4.0,7/13/2016,"Had an excellent time here with 4 other friends this past Sunday. Our food was great, the store was clean and the employees are great. Our waiter was very nice and attentive. Great dining experience, the wait was ok, if it was better, this visit would have been 5 stars"
Ron M.,"Riverside, CA",0,33,2,5.0,6/20/2017,Ok so I did a recent review of how bad the experience was we had.  We have an onion allergy and it all went bad. The manager even helped us pick out items with out onions first bite full of onions. If daughter took a bite it would have been a hospital visit.  Well since then we got a call from corporate and asked to visit them again. This last visit was great.  The server Veronica M went out of her way with how busy she was she made sure everything was perfect. Very impressed with this visit and glad we gave it another chance. This allergy sucks and considering it came on over the last couple of years it isn't we don't like onions my daughter and I both do but she is deathly Ill to them now and I get very sick. So for them to not really research the first time was bad so the second time they did just that and made it a great experience. It sucks not to be able to eat out due to onion and onion powder.  So thank you again Veronica for making it such a great b day dinner.
Mai N.,"Corona, CA",6,7,6,5.0,5/1/2016,Our service was excellent thank you Aubrey and Andrew.  Dinner perfect my husband had steak Diane and I loved my farfalle chicken with roasted garlic. Yum .
Mireya R.,"Riverside, CA",0,1,,1.0,11/21/2016,"The food was good, my server was very polite & sweet. However the people working in the place where the cheesecakes are made are completely irresponsible & can't even have the cheesecake delivered to a table. I will for sure never consider coming here to spend another birthday ."
Ant M.,"Moreno Valley, CA",0,8,8,2.0,6/11/2016,I would have rated three or four stars but a female server would rather argue with me than get something I paid for. Was very disappointed with customer service here this time not sure if there will be a next time visit at least at this cheesecake factory. Long story that ended in bad experience on my fiancee birthday.
Tiffany W.,"San Francisco, CA",377,53,323,2.0,3/15/2015,"Came in to eat a nice meal with my boyfriend. We were seated quickly and our waiter was nice. My boyfriend ordered a bacon-bacon cheeseburger, that came out and went into his stomach without a hitch. I ordered the pesto pasta. It came out, looked good, and smelled good. BUT THEN.... Hallway through eating, I found 2 small pieces of hair IN the pasta. It couldn't have been mine nor my boyfriends because he didn't touch my pasta. I immediately lost my appetite and asked for a to-go box, after discarding the piece of pasta with the hairs on it and the surrounding area. The next day: I wanted to give my pasta another go so I warmed it up, sat down to eat, and again, halfway though eating, found ANOTHER a piece of hair.  I have never been to an establishment where I have come across so many pieces of hair in one meal, even if the establishment wasn't exactly sanitary to begin with. This was my first and last time at this Cheesecake Factory because my experience has ruined my appetite for any further food from Riverside Cheesecake Factory by Tyler Mall."
Ashley O.,"Redlands, CA",0,10,,3.0,11/16/2016,I've come here quite a few times and never had any issues but the last time I came here the waitress kept telling me that the food was taking a long time because of the modifications I requested-understandable I suppose. However the third time she mentioned it I started to feel bad! Our food took 45 minutes to arrive but it was correct and tasted great. Drinks were good despite a long wait as well.
Nicole D.,"West Covina, CA",0,7,1,3.0,10/25/2015,"The wait to be seated wasn't bad (late Saturday night). Prices were reasonable for the huge desserts. (We had appetizers and cheesecake for four.) The only complaints were 1) our waiter seemed less than excited to help us. Wasn't particularly friendly, either. Maybe it had been a long day.  2) We were seated at a ridiculous corner booth lined with mirrors. The hostess acted like this was a great honor but I was less keen on the novelty. At best it is a distraction, at worse you get to catch unflattering angles of yourself while talking and eating. Who's idea was THIS???"
Angelica B.,"Murrieta, CA",58,84,30,2.0,2/6/2016,"So the cheesecake factory has been my favorite restaurant forever .... Well Not Anymore !!! I was finally able to go and now I wish i didn't waste my $$$ !!! I ordered the spicey chicken tacos , omg the tacos were disgusting!  The chicken was rough and tough it felt like I was chewing on chicken jerky *barf* and the black beans , and rice were gross too ! I'm getting queeezy thinking about it . Anywho, my kids got the mac and cheese , and chicken and fries . My kids didn't like there meals , the only good thing about our experience was the cheesecake . I got the snickers cheesecake it was just OK.  My daughter got the red velvet cheesecake ... I will admit it was pretty good . And my son got the 30th anniversary cheesecake . That too was good . Rich but delicious !! We do not plan I n coming back anytime soon"
Sean W.,"Riverside, CA",0,3,1,2.0,6/2/2016,"I'll start with cheese cake factory food is good the few times I've been.  I did my first to go order today, asked if they have a chow mien style noodle with chicken, they said we have garlic noodle.  Ok is it similar to a chow mien style noodle with chicken, they said yes, great I'll get that and the rest of our order. I pick up the food, didn't check what it looked like and got home. When I opened at home, I got a buttery oil noodle like pasta, opposite of chow mien style, with a small chicken breast with bone. The complaint is, when I'll called back to ask what was my order they said Garlic noodle, I said ok, I wanted a chow mien style of noodle pasta.  They said we don't have that.  I said well you did when I called to order.  with a very frustrated response into a 45 second phone call, she said *itchingly ""do you need to talk to a manager"". I wasn't trying to escalate things just was trying to get an understanding of their menu and food.  So I said no, don't need to complain or be a burden on a manager just wanted to know if you served what I was trying to get.  A long pause on their side, so I said well I guess not so I guess thats it for our conversation.  She hung up the phone. There is 2 stars because of the gal who walked back and forth to my truck in the heat to bring me my food, otherwise 0 for blatantly ignorant customer service. I will choose elsewhere for my ordering out, because I like an even respect between orderer and food provider. Also that particular dish was really not good at all, however there have been dishes at this place that are excellent."
Daniel R.,"Moreno Valley, CA",31,8,,2.0,3/19/2015,"Went back a second time...  this time for late dinner / early lunch on a weekday.  The server was OUTSTANDING!  But, the mashed potatoes were cold again!  They brought out a second serving, this one was finally nice and hot.  Ordered 2 pieces of cheesecake that we enjoyed there.  I can't believe that after speaking to the manager while I was there, we still got cold food.   The service was great... but somehow I was more disappointed about the cold food."
