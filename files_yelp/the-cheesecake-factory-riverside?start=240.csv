John R.,"Westwood, Los Angeles, CA",268,30,15,5.0,9/2/2015,Our thanks to Fred Hanna and his staff for working with our team to feed a crew of 12 on a feature film. The food was outstanding and we appreciate the service your team provided.
Crystal V.,"Riverside, CA",60,3,,5.0,5/7/2016,Love the cheesecake factory one of my favorite places. The salted caramel cheesecake to die for.
Rosie A.,"Riverside, CA",1,56,,5.0,10/7/2015,"I've been to several of their locations in SoCal. This location is one of the better ones, trust me! The service compared to other ones, is much better. Even though it's a chain restaurant, I believe each one has its' nuances.  Last time I was there, I left my credit card! Lo-and-behold, our server Nick came and found us  outside just as we were entering the mall. Now, that's what I call great service on top of being timely with the orders/drinks, courteous manner, and non-pushy demeanor. He didn't have to do it. He could have just left it with the front desk for me to come back to eventually, several days later."
Soemi J.,"Corona, CA",77,52,54,5.0,12/24/2014,"Loved it had my birthday dinner there, the waitress was super nice and the food was amazing. Try getting outside tables it's actually not that cold because they have like this warmer thing haaha"
Kendyll S.,"Riverside, CA",94,33,3,4.0,6/6/2015,"So much to choose from! The Chicken Bellagio is one of my favorites here but anything you get is delicious! The only thing I'm not a fan of is the garden salad they serve, too much arugula.  As far as cheesecake goes, you can't beat it here. Try the raspberry and white chocolate! My mouth is watering just thinking about it now!"
Evelyn M.,"Irvine, CA",0,3,,5.0,11/21/2016,"My family was there to celebrate birthdays.  My mom is elderly and dad is disabled.  An outing with my parents can be stressful at times because they don't get out much and are anxious about everything.  Shannon D. was our waitress and she is a ""keeper,"" as my mom puts it.  Shannon D. was knowledgable and professional when it came to her job, but she was so pleasant, patient, and caring.  She was very personable and kind!!  She made our celebration that much better!!  Thank you again Shannon D."
Babor H.,"Corona, CA",51,21,68,5.0,5/29/2015,Great dinner at Cheese Cake Factory. Variety of choice..!
Joy K.,"Denver, CO",607,91,24,3.0,4/17/2015,"Came here last week for lunch.  Positives: The service was decent and my food was delicious. Outdoor covered patio is delightful when the weather is good, which it was that day.  I ordered a salad, but forgot to ask for it without the bacon. The server was helpful and had the kitchen make it again. That was nice... The negatives: Table (outside) had a layer of dust that I had to wipe down with my napkin. Not as may vegetarian options as I would like.  Overall it's a nice place to relax and enjoy a meal."
Melinda O.,"Corona, CA",205,69,87,5.0,12/23/2015,Went on a Saturday evening expecting a long wait especially for a table for 8. It did take roughly an hour. The food was fantastic. The side salad was great and the cashew spicy chicken was very flavorful. I tried the tiramisu cheesecake and it was okay. The service was by far the best I have had here. With the 18% tip already included the waitress still did a great job.
Clarisa G.,"Upland, CA",74,16,5,5.0,3/5/2016,Came in to a very friend hello from Daniel and my server Deana was the best very friendly and accommodating with a genuin smile. Came in just to get some homework done and it was the perfect place. Thank you again guys!
Carole S.,"Riverside, CA",48,9,,4.0,11/2/2016,Had the Beef Medallions on the Skinnylicious menu- delicious beef cooked to perfection but disappointed that tablespoonful of mashed potatoes was hidden completely under the beef/gravy/veggie mixture. Server Tracy G was sweet-brought me some more. Hubby had the California Cheese Steak which he loved. Tried the cucumber/mint lemonade which is wonderful but pricey at $5 as was the $8 one slice of cheesecake I ordered to go (not going to do that again.  Great ambiance with the art deco interior and they surprised me with a free birthday sundae (It was) which would have been more than adequate for dessert. Took half of our dinners home for lunch today.  4 stars for being a little expensive.  food is always great!
Nicole B.,"Santa Monica, CA",724,576,391,4.0,3/18/2012,I've reviewed The Cheesecake Factory before so this review will be fairly short. I recently came here with my family for an early dinner. The food was great and it came out fairly quickly! The place wasn't crowded and the servers were all really friendly. This time around  we ordered the crunchy crab balls as an appetizer(i think that's what they're called) and they were amazingggggg!!! Very fresh!
Alex D.,"Riverside, CA",6,62,23,5.0,12/30/2014,Always come here and love it every time. The food is excellent as well as the service.  They have plenty of different types of entrees you will never get bored of the menu. To top it off they got the best cheesecake
Casey O.,"Riverside, CA",0,15,,5.0,5/3/2017,"I went yesterday around 1pm.The food was great. There was a wide variety on the menu and even for drinks, which i liked. I got a seat that i really liked too. But what made my experience amazing was our server Kevin T. He did amazing. Probably one of the best servers I've ever had. We never really had to ask for anything. He was always on it about everything especially the refills which i liked. Anything we needed for our order, he made sure we got it. I had a great birthday and now I can say cheesecake factory is one of my favorite restaurants. I'll definitely be back and will be choosing it over a few other restaurants I like and will be recommending it to other people. Thanks for the great service! Oh side note, my mother went with me and i take her out a lot and she's super picky and is never satisfied with any restaurant but she was happy the whole time about everything and didnt complain about anything which she always does. So my mom being completely happy with a restaurant was a shocker, it made my time a lot better but this place did great! So thank you! Couldnt have chosen a better place to have lunch for my birthday!"
Staci S.,"Riverside, CA",186,16,3,5.0,11/19/2015,"3 times now I have gotten the Spicy chipolte pasta, no meat and it has been so delicious. Two thumbs up! And the cheesecake... o my goodness! Yumm."
Tiffany B.,"Beaumont, CA",143,96,50,5.0,12/6/2015,"Huge fan of cheese cake factory! Best mimosas I've ever had! Cool atmosphere and The portion of food is BIG which I love and yet hate. service is always great. I love the Mac and cheese appetizer balls, pasta dishes, and of course the cheese cakes our amazing! However, I wish cheese cake factory had pictures on the menu, I don't care to see advertisements, instead id like to see a lot more pictures please!"
Jessica B.,"White City, OR",115,14,,1.0,10/6/2016,Horrible service. We called to place our order for pick up. The lady on the other end was very rude. When we got to the restaurant to pick up our food we had interaction with her again. Not only was she rude over the phone she was just as rude in person. When we got there to pay she told me the cheesecake I wanted was out. So then I mentioned another one she said they didn't have all the stuff that went with it. So I finally picked one that was available. When we got home we noticed that my boyfriend and friend got the exact same cheesecake and it was the wrong one for both of them. Never going to this location again.
Luis P.,"Covington, KY",1,15,1,5.0,2/23/2016,"Considering it was Valentines day weekend I was expecting a long wait to be seated. To my surprise we were at our booth within 15 minutes of arriving. We ordered a couple of drinks which took a little long but nothing to cry home about. The cucumber lemonade was amazing! We started out ordering the firecracker salmon  wraps which came out in a jiffy and were pipping hot (temperature) and sitting on a tangy sauce of deliciousness. Both our entrees soon followed and  tasted just as wonderful and they looked. Our waitress was funny,pleasant, and very attentive. Considering the controlled chaos around us she always took care of us and all her other guest.  Not once did we feel as if they were in a rush or urging us to vamoose. Would definitely return and recommend to anybody."
Romana R.,"Riverside, CA",0,4,1,1.0,10/23/2016,"Although this place has wonderful cheescake, I was VERY disappointed when halfway into my Chicken Madeira, I bit onto a piece of hard burnt plastic the size of a quarter. The server brought over the manager. The manager explained the cook must have been in a hurry and chopped a piece of plastic into my food which I could have potentially swallowed or damaged my braces. My meal was on the house, however the manager did not express concern about the plastic chemicals that were cooked into my dish that could also have caused harm. There was also a server named Nick, who happened to hit on a friend of ours at the table. Very unprofessional. This place obviously believes in quantity not quality even down to staff."
Amanda A.,"Dearborn, MI",38,97,467,5.0,1/28/2016,I've tried the Cheesecake Factory in all the states I've visited and what I love is that they are always consistent! Delicious! I always get the herb crusted salmon and Oreo cheesecake. YUM!
