I didn't know where to start.. but TIm helped out and I loved my dish.. but the reason for this Yelp is really to tell you to try the CUCUMBER lemonade!! It is soooooooooo good!!  I have never had anything like it!  you have to try it!  oh and did I tell you Tim was really nice.. :)
Tom V.,"Temecula, CA",0,251,32,4.0,3/25/2015,"Ate here last night before catching the Pink Floyd Experience at the Fox in downtown Riverside. No reservations are taken, at least on a weekday. We popped in at about 5:20pm and were seated relatively quickly. we have eaten at a TCF before, but were still amazed at how darn many items are on the menu! Our waiter, Adam, was patient with us, not overbearing and attentive (but not annoying). We ordered the following: Sangria (her) Iced Tea (me) Sausage Ricotta Flatbread (us) Shrimp Summer Rolls (us) Skinny Chicken Salad Sandwich (her) Bacon-Bacon Cheeseburger (me)  Onions Rings (me - BURP) We both enjoyed our meals very much. The two appetizers were excellent and full of flavor. The peanut sauce and sweet chili sauce that came with the rolls were both delicious. My burger was cooked just as I ordered, they did not skimp on the bacon and it was not greasy. The onion rings were tasty and not greasy either. The wife said she would order the chicken sandwich again and the Sangria was one of the best she has had."
Biancua B.,"Riverside, CA",94,59,28,5.0,9/1/2014,My favorite restaurant. I love the cheesecake factory!! I love coming to this location I have never had a issue. Great customer service every time I come here. It does get crowded sometimes but mostly on weekends but what can you do(people want cheesecake duh!!!!) Always going to be my favorite.
Roman G.,"Irvine, CA",4,174,29,4.0,1/31/2016,Service was excellent which made this meal better then It probably was. My guest and I boordered cheesecakes for dessert and those were both outstanding. Overall a great experience.
Justine T.,"Barstow-Victorville, CA",26,12,2,5.0,2/26/2016,Chicken piccata is always the greatest.  There beet salad with goat cheese is really good also.
Brittany D.,"Riverside, CA",172,6,,3.0,4/12/2016,"Overall my experience here was ok. What was said to be only a 10-15 minute wait for a table turned into a half hour and then once we were seated it took another 15 minutes just to get bread in front of us. The waiter was very kind though and therefore gave us very good service. However once you are waiting an extra twenty minutes just to be sat, you tend to get very irritated at the whole establishment. The hostesses were not accurate on timing or hospitality. They were rude about the entire seating situation and didn't seem to care that we waited for a half hour when we were told the wait was only going to be about half of that."
Valeria V.,"Burbank, CA",0,6,1,1.0,8/25/2016,Horrible management & servers need an attitude fix. Just go to pf changs accross the street their much friendly.
Christopher P.,"Corona, CA",0,3,4,5.0,6/9/2015,"I went their last month with my family for Mother's Day. My first time there and the food was really good and our waiter/server his name was Kevin, I believe, was awesome! He was very attentive with what we needed and overall my experience there while dining was great! If anybody wants really good service and a great server.. Hopefully Kevin will be their waiter :)"
Kendra F.,"Riverside, CA",5,9,,5.0,3/5/2016,"Oh how I love thee Cheesecake Factory! I always always have an excellent time here. Food is always on point, and servers funny and awesome. Thanks for another great visit!"
dana p.,"Beaumont, CA",40,33,3,2.0,1/23/2016,"I'm not sure, I was enjoying my food until I found a hair in my lemon wedge. So should u mention it even though ur finished with ur food now or let it be??"
Pam D.,"Corona, CA",0,6,5,5.0,2/18/2016,"I like it here. Quick dinner nice service nice portion, clean bathroom that's all I need. Probably going to be my new go-to restaurant. It is pricy but I don't mind for clean environment. If you want cheap food expect nasty restaurant."
Misty W.,"Riverside, CA",54,10,24,2.0,7/31/2014,"Usually I love this place. LOVE. Today was less than stellar. Celebrating a friends bday on our lunch HOUR. Let our server, Catalina, know that we were on a time limit first thing. It was a bummer because she didn't appear to even try to be attentive (or smile) for that manner. We always split a dessert there. She came back (at a glacial pace) letting us know they aren't splitting desserts ""today"". Translation: I forgot to ask and don't care to accommodate you. We felt that we were walking her through the process of serving... As we had to ask for check, go cups, boxes versus her anticipating our needs."
Richard W.,"Corona, CA",0,6,,4.0,2/15/2016,This was our first visit to the restuarant. The food was excellant. The service was perfect. We had the california cheese steak. It was so good and the portions were large. We had such a good time we were planning our next visit before the check came.
Natashia M.,"Riverside, CA",4,12,3,1.0,1/18/2016,"My fiancé and I decided to have dinner here tonight. The service was horrible the food wasn't good and it definitely was over priced. It took the servers almost 45 mins just to bring out our food. We only got two glasses of soda without any refills. And the food was horrible. We got nachos, fries, salad, and pizza. Tasted like something you could get at a fast food establishment. The server wasn't friendly either she didn't offer any desserts or offer to get us another refill. We took our food to go since we didn't finish it all. The server packed it for us. We get home and everything was just ruined like they just dumped it in boxes and didn't show any care in the world the pizza toppings were at the bottom of the box and the crust was soggy. We threw it out. Waste of 70 bucks."
Melody C.,"Corona, CA",0,24,,5.0,9/17/2016,"Better everything than a The Yard House and T.J. Fridays restaurants.  Better service, way better food and their cheesecakes are to die for. I usually go for the plain cheesecake and all of their yummy steak dishes!"
Hung-Hei Y.,"San Gabriel, CA",93,280,197,4.0,1/20/2013,"One of our guilty pleasures but there are some pretty good dishes here. It seems we always order some same items every time including the Pasta Da Vinci, French Country Salad, Avocado Eggrolls, Crusted Chicken Romano, Garlic Noodles, Firecracker Salmon Rolls, and Fresh Fire-Roasted Artichoke.  You can't go wrong with these."
Elizabeth P.,"Riverside, CA",0,50,,2.0,3/15/2016,"I see why this place has 3 1/2 stars.  We only go every few years, but now it will be even less frequently. We showed up for happy hour which we didn't even realize they had. The sign was inviting so when the hostess asked we said yes he does in the happy hour area. The menu included Margaritas for $5.50 on the happy hour menu. We didn't realize that if you ordered a strawberry margarita it was the full $10.25. The waitress didn't say a word and brought us the strawberry margaritas three of them. When it came time to pay the check we were surprised by the extra $15 on the bill. The waitress apologized and said she would ask the manager what she could do about it. The manager's response was nothing. We could have become regular customers. Everything else about the visit was fine. But now it'll be several years before we try again. There's plenty of other restaurants in the sea."
Juanita C.,"West Covina, CA",10,6,3,5.0,11/9/2014,Excellent service!!! They had forgotten about one of dishes and the rest manager came up to apologize ( we were not even complaining) (: but i think it was very nice to have come up to us to personally talk to us!!(:
Malvika T.,"Irvine, CA",213,148,266,3.0,11/14/2014,"We came here for my friend's birthday and I was astonished to see that the service was extremely subpar. Our waiters were slacking and kept messing up orders. I understand that our group was big but then maybe there should have been 2-3 servers instead of 1? The other times I've come here I've had great service but I was disappointed this time. Overall, the food is excellent and the cheesecake is incredible, but the service could use some improvement."
