Synthia T.,"Corona, CA",7,68,71,2.0,9/2/2015,"I typically really enjoy this location but today I didn't have time to dine-in so I ordered out and I'm so sad that I spent $50 and got nothing. Everyone knows how huge the portions are but mine was very small and had maybe 2 spoonfuls of rice in my chili, at first I was looking through the bag assuming that it was on the side. Really sad that I spent so much money on my favorite dish and it wasn't even right. If it wasn't so far away I would definitely go back and ask for my money back. Don't get me wrong, the service is spectacular but I will never order out again. :("
Christina S.,"San Jacinto, CA",0,6,1,1.0,9/1/2016,"This is the first time that I have ever walked out of a restaurant. My husband and I were excited to eat here since the cheesecake sounded tasty! We walked in around 4:20pm it wasn't busy at all we got seated right away, I'd say we sat down at 4:25pm we noticed servers walking by attending other tables however ours had not been visited since we were seated. We had not been offered drinks or appetizers, no one had come to our table at all. There were maybe 4 other tables with people sitting at them in their dining room all of which had been waited on. At about 5:00pm my husband and I decided to walk out without being served anything and go to Red Robin instead. I was very disappointed with this service. I expected way better service considering the price of the menu items. It was absolutely not worth our time!"
Monalisa P.,"Loma Linda, CA",3,12,2,5.0,8/13/2016,"Always love coming here, the food is always delicious and love their cheesecake! Definitely recommend going here for birthdays or whatever you're celebrating or just anytime you're craving their food."
Jacqueline O.,"Corona, CA",285,46,14,5.0,11/16/2014,"I had a wonderful experience at the Cheesecake Factory. Of course it is always overwhelming because the menu is so crazy out of control but our food was good but I have to compliment our waiter, his name was Noah. He just seemed to be a perfect waiter, he didn't check on us every two minutes which can be very irritating but I can see he would eyeball us to see if we might need something or if our drinks were low. So he was constantly checking  just not interrupting us. And just super friendly and pleasant. He definitely made our time at T.C.F great.  Good customer service makes me very happy... especially when we are in a money crunch.. so when we get to splurge and go somewhere nice....it is very nice to know the splurge was totally worth it.  Vs spending a lot of money out and then having a bad dining experience.   Thank you Noah...keep up the good work and thank you for serving us and making us feel special."
Dennis Y.,"Riverside, CA",16,29,119,1.0,5/8/2016,"After a 2 hour plus wait, our party of 8 was sitting outside at a distance where the. Pager reach was in question. I stood close by so my family can wait comfortably outside. As soon. As the pager went off, my brother in law and I walked up to the hostess claim our table. They said, if the rest of the party is not here, we are giving your table to the next in line... WTF!  We checked on this table 3 times over the course of the 2 plus hours. What kind of place is this where we were not allowed to make reservations but other Cheesecake Factories do take reservations!"
Danny V.,"Santa Ana, CA",2,7,,5.0,9/12/2015,The food is always excellent and so are the services. This place has the best ambience. The waiters and waitresses are extra nice and professional. I love this place!
Dan D.,"Desert Hot Springs, CA",13,36,,1.0,8/20/2016,"Cheesecake response to my complaint about their stock responses was ""We have addressed this with our team to make sure that this does not happen again."", gee, that happened 4 months ago, so just whom did you guys address.  I'll think twice before eating there again."
Carolyn R.,"Riverside, CA",10,170,93,5.0,10/11/2015,"Except for the crowds, this place is awesome! We chose to sit at the bar, for a meal and drinks, and had excellent service! Every bit of their food is delectable! Bar drink service was spot on, ambiance was nice but fun, everything was clean... Desserts are to die for even though they are a bit pricey. Portions are on the bigger side, so don't be afraid to share, but some of the higher priced menu items fall a little short. It's hard to get EVERYTHING right, but they are coming close..."
Sami U.,"Riverside, CA",27,8,8,5.0,1/27/2016,My family dined in the bar at this location last night. We received the best service that we have ever had at a Cheesecake Factory! Our servers name was Mony. She was very attentive and very sweet especially with my small children. My 1 year old spilled a cup of water on the floor and we felt horrible but she was very quick to get it taken care of. I was really disappointed to find out they no longer have the pineapple upside down cheesecake but the Thai lettuce wraps were amazing as always. Thanks again for the great experience Mony. It's very difficult to dine out with small children but you made it awesome!
Cortney V.,"Sun City, CA",0,5,,5.0,1/25/2016,"Me and my boyfriend drove out here from Temecula California about a 40 minute drive. & it was more than worth it. The food was fantastic and the atmosphere was very nice. But the best part of our experience was our server! Jairo C, made our experience one to remember. Such a kind man and excellent at his job. We really appreciated his service. Working in food retail for years myself, it is hard to come by a worker like this one. He is definitely an asset to this company. I will definitely recommend this place to my friends and family and will be back! Thanks Jairo!"
Joe R.,"Redlands, CA",0,2,1,2.0,2/13/2016,"Hello we are sitting outside of the cheesecake factory waiting a very very  very very very very long time! we traveled a long distance just to wait a very very long time we've been out here for three hours and still waiting what kind of stuff is that if I was at Buffalo wild wings, gourmet burgers and brews,McDonald's even it would not take that long so I ask you this why wait!! The food was not that good it was actually bad it was cold when I received it and it was horrible when I ate it so the managers here are inconsiderable and garbage!"
Jake R.,"Corona, CA",4,45,39,5.0,11/17/2015,Wow really good food. Really good service. And the portion size is great. Gotta love bringing home left overs. Great place best bang for your buck! I will be returning.
Laila A.,"Corona, CA",6,26,30,5.0,6/11/2015,"We were s party of 15 ... It was really a busy day and the Resturant was packed, took them 10 minutes to seat us, nick was our server, he was fast and attentive, the food was great as usual !! This is not my first time to Cheesecake Factory, and it always been the same service !!"
Shana G.,"Riverside, CA",90,42,50,5.0,7/20/2015,"My husband, kids and I stopped by for a quick family lunch this afternoon. Service was good. I am sure my husband will post his own review so I will stick to talking about mine and the kids. My daughter had the bow-tie pasta which was average, she loves pasta anywhere we go. My son had the chicken strips with fruit. The breading on this chicken was light and flakey, it looked so good I had to take a taste. It was good. I was impressed with the fruit cup he was given, it had more to it than chunks of melon that you get most places. My son was happy to see berries in it. I ordered the Thai Lettuce Wraps (appetizer) as my entree and I am glad I did. It was awesome. It has been quite some time since I have been to The Cheesecake Factory, and I don't know why...its good! Overall, we had a very pleasant lunch and will return in the future."
Yasmin E.,"Irvine, CA",0,7,,3.0,2/6/2016,I don't like to write negative reviews but the food is very heavy and lacks taste. The food is very flat. No spices and filled up with butter and heavy cream
Jay K.,"Los Angeles, CA",1127,338,660,4.0,3/23/2014,"Chain restaurants are simple to review. As you review one, you pretty much review them all. I always liked Cheese Cake, you don't stay in business all these years without doing something right.  I have nothing to add that hasn't been noted, except that I wanted to point out that our server was exceptional. I realize service is as good as the individual person and it varies, but this guy was smooth. He filled glasses without asking, dropped extra butter on the sly while serving meals, even noticed a meal half eaten was incorrect and boxed the right order to go. He probably did a few things we didn't even noticed, cause when you're good no one should even know.  It leaves me to wonder if management trains for this level of hospitality or did his mom bring him up right? Regardless, I've been to some hoity-toity places that could learn a thing or two from this guy. a Thumbs up, but always let me know what you think."
Dieter J.,"Santa Ana, CA",0,7,,4.0,1/25/2016,"I ordered food to go from here recently. Wow, very impressed. Great steak, and friendly service on the telephone and inside too."
Anne R.,"Riverside, CA",10,21,6,5.0,10/30/2015,I Love going here. I have tried many of the items on the menu from starters appetizers to main entree to their selections of desserts and cheesecake. I love their bread and butter and always leave wanting to come back. Service is good and they do a good job at customer service
