Brooklynn S.,"Moreno Valley, CA",1,21,3,5.0,6/11/2015,Excellent service! Every plate was prepared so beautifully and our waitress Calvin was great. We will be definitely be coming back soon
Tim J.,"Corona, CA",0,17,,1.0,6/30/2015,"Ordered food and someone dropped the ball. I did not receive  what I ordered. Will be a while,before I return again. Bad service."
Danny S.,"Loma Linda, CA",62,511,2,3.0,1/30/2013,"Had a business lunch on 1/29.  Great setting for a business lunch.  Not to terribly noisy and not too stuffy.  Service was decent and you can always count on the variety of food.  Only hiccup was that my friend ordered the pizza/salad combo.  The pizza came out first an the salad came out a few mins later.  I would have thought that it would be the other way around.  The gumbo was spot on as usual.  My friend got the Vietnamese spring rolls and lettuce tacos (interesting combo).   All in all, I would return there again for a business lunch meeting."
C M.,"Redlands, CA",0,52,5,1.0,6/28/2015,"This place has horrible service, waited 10 minutes for the waiter to start. This fool didn't even put in our order for food til our appetizer came out. Waited 25 minutes for a sandwich and a tuna salad, ran out of time and had to take it to go. Manager thought he did a favor by taking off the appetizer . Will never go back again."
Ryan C.,"Riverside, CA",178,7,3,3.0,5/4/2015,"Looking at the reviews I'm perplexed as to why some of you are upset about it being busy on a Friday night... That being said, my experience here is always tremendously fulfilling. The Chicken Costaletta is always a winner.  That being said, a couple of visits ago there was a pubic hair (couldn't be curlier) in my fries. The compensation for this was a free cheesecake. I was expecting my plate of food to be comped since I didn't finish half of it after finding the genital hair.  I'd rather eat chicken than cheesecake but that's me. I'll still go back because I've had a hundred good experiences... But throwing free cheesecake at problems isn't the answer."
Michelle T.,"Costa Mesa, CA",779,999,1108,3.0,5/2/2014,"The typical cheesecake factory experience. While this place is a safe bet, nothing is ever super amazing.  I've been here a few times and one time we had a super rude waitress but the other two times the service was great. Tonight I had the skinnylicious salmon salad and the chicken piccata. Both were yummy but the salad wins. Also noticed that the crowd here is somewhat of a mixed bag."
Felicia L.,"Long Beach, CA",600,1593,658,3.0,12/14/2010,"I've been here one too many times that it's lost it's appeal on me. It is a great place with a beautiful ambiance and large portions of food. Oh also the sourdough and pumpernickle bread! And butter! Cheesecake Factory has been scrutinized for their high calorie content in all their food. So much they had to give a separate menu displaying all the caloric content for all their food. Anyways yeah... we're all fat-asses at hear at Yelp... let me give you some recommendations, lol: What I would recommend? Avocado Egg Rolls, the Sweet Corn Tamales, and the Sun Dried Tomato Pasta. What I would not recommend? The $10 alcoholic drinks, lol. Too expensive and not worth it (their Mai Tai sucks! Although their Mojito is good, still too expensive!) Ah.... ok. This place is okay."
Amaya S.,"Redlands, CA",783,486,855,3.0,6/25/2012,"3 1/2 Stars. In the grand scheme of things I'm really happy there is a Cheesecake Factory so close to home.  And with it being located at Tyler I tend to come here and eat, go in the mall and shop, then go to AMC and remember they are way to damn high and go home.  Seriously I walk up those stairs and get pissed every time...... when will I learn. As we all know the parking is ridiculous.  Not that there isn't enough space, because their is. But, with it being so close to the malls entrance there is always congestion.  But you'll live. As with any CF its beautiful. But, I have the same problem here as with every other location 1. Why is the floor so damn slippery? 2. The front entrance is a waste of space. Maybe you could reduce the under-equipped sitting area and put more tables so we can sit sooner. I have had a lot of meals at CF, all over So Cal and Vegas, but here is where I had a life altering meal.  I'm a big Burger fan so I came here for a gourmet Burger.  I settled for the Macaroni and Cheese Burger.  The skinny angel on my shoulder got beat up by the fat devil obviously.  There I am trying to rationalize my decision, and it comes out.  And what did I say? ""Oh my God, what have I done"". Not a good sign.  Not at all. The Burger (in all its glory) had a delicious bun, medium rare patty, FRIED mac and cheese ball with cheese sauce and typical Burger condiments.  I ate the WHOLE Burger.  It was THAT good.  And I almost started crying.  I couldn't believe I ordered it to begin with, AND ate it all.  I was so depressed I couldn't shop..... so I went home.  I've never experienced that before. It was totally worth it, although Ill never eat it again. Eat this Burger if: - Your self esteem is too high and needs a reality check - You like feeling miserable - You are tired of McDonald's and will cross the bridge of depression when you get to it. :)"
I judge Y.,"Moreno Valley, CA",22,72,4,5.0,6/8/2015,Great food! Great service!  My waiter was very helpful with assisting me on my order and was also very good on refilling my ice tea! Wonderfully friendly and sweet with my children! I've always had a great experience at CCF! I can't remember my servers name so that I can recommend him?  I think it was Alden? He had a big black beard lol
Bee M.,"Riverside, CA",0,12,2,1.0,5/11/2015,Take out sucks food is cold and soggy shrimp gross ! Never again will I eat there microwave dinner tastes better than that .
Sandy S.,"Irvine, CA",2,22,,3.0,10/4/2014,"It's alright. Overpriced for the quality and taste, in my opinion. I had the Cajun shrimp pasta; pretty flavorful but nothing special. I also had the basil garlic shrimp pasta and that was alright too. Nothing I can't make better at home. The cheesecake is very rich but not sickening. I'd stick to ordering the desserts over the dinners."
Monica R.,"Mira Loma, CA",2,9,,5.0,9/28/2015,First time going in and it was awesome food was delicious and our server was really kind her name was Melissa she told us which plates were good and we left satisfied i would definitely go back! :)
Eve H.,"Corona, CA",72,105,126,4.0,7/28/2014,"For you gluten free dieters must try veggie burger (I did have it with bread) in a lettuce wrap. But I think actual patty needed a little salt. Despite that it still tastes good because you can't really taste it needs salt with all condiments; lettuce, mayo, mustard, onion, tomato and I think it also had pickles. I definitely appreciate a restaurant that serves a veggie burger hand made as opposed to a frozen Boca burger as most restaurants do. Cheers to that! My daughter had bow tie pasta in meat sauce all I can say is yummy! Still waiting for a dairy free gluten free dessert:( when they do I'll give it 5 stars till then 4 stars and I don't score easily. Great job cheesecake factory. Oh and service is good too:)"
Eric H.,"Corona, CA",214,125,37,5.0,7/24/2014,I really like going to restaurants that aren't chain restaurants but if I do go this is definitely on the top of my list cheesecake factory always has fresh ingredients and is always worth the money They have so many great items to choose from also
David J.,"Corona, CA",768,131,95,2.0,4/23/2014,"There is something about the Cheesecake Factory that they just cant get dinner right with me. Twice when I lived in Seattle, epic fail. Once in Dallas, fail. And now at Tyler Mall in Cali. Took the fam there on a Saturday evening and there was a wait for seating but we sat outside. Waited a bit for drinks. Then I ordered a steak dinner when the rest of my family made their order. I told the server I like my steaks medium well. I was catching a buzz from my drink we waited so long for our food. When it finally arrived my steak was medium rare. When I finally got my servers attention I asked him to tell how I ordered my steak. He did in fact remember and then I showed him the blood in my steak. He took it back and later brought me a steak that was well done, you know...like the sole of a boot. I cut into it and when I finally got my server's attention, I asked him did this steak look medium well. He agreed it did not. He took it back and THIS time the manager brought me out a medium well cooked steak but now my family was done eating and ready to go home!! Cheesecake Factory should just stick to desserts because you have failed me with dinner 4 TIMES!!"
Erin R.,"Riverside, CA",13,62,,4.0,8/2/2015,"My husband and I enjoyed dinner here on Friday night. We had wonderful service from Melissa. She made recommendations when asked about meals and dessert. She was always prompt with our drinks and making sure we had all that we needed. For dinner my husband had the Mac n' cheese burger and I had the Chicken Madeira, recommended by Melissa. Both dinners were wonderful. My husband is somewhat of a burger connoisseur, he orders one nearly every where we go. He LOVED his burger. For dessert we had a Salted Caramel Cheesecake and a Reese's Peanut Butter Fudge Cake Cheesecake. We both enjoyed our dinner and our service."
Christy M.,"Murrieta, CA",3,44,4,2.0,9/25/2014,So I'm not sure why I keep going back to the Cheesecake Factory (I'm pretty sure it's because the food is amazing but after today's experience I am not sure that matters anymore). I met my Mom and son here today for lunch.  When I arrived at the restaurant they were already seated and had ordered my son's lunch.  Shortly after I arrived so did his macaroni and I started to think that maybe today we would get good service!  I was sadly mistaken... My mom ordered the Asian Chicken Tacos ( from the Skinny Menu).  I ordered my usual the Luau Salad.  When our lunches arrived i requested more dressing as my salad was just a tad bit dry.  When the server brought out the dressing I took a large spoonful and added the dressing to my salad!  My mistake...I should have tasted it first to make sure it was the right dressing before pouring on my salad (I assumed that my server would bring the correct dressing).  In any case I took one bite and realized that it wasn't right (this is a sweet salad and the dressing she brought tasted like balsamic vinegar...very tangy).  It honestly took about 10 mins before our server came back to check on us at which time I told her that it was the wrong dressing.  No apology but she did offer to remake my salad.   About 15 mins later my new salad still hadn't arrived but my server walked over to the table with 2 containers of dressing and told me to sample both.  She said one was balsamic and one was a shallot vinegarette.   I tasted both and they tasted very similar (no surprise as they looked identical as well).  She then began to argue with me that she had brought the shallot vinegarette to begin with.  She kept asking which dressing I wanted on my salad!  I told her that I was frustrated because I was pretty certain that neither dressing was right!  I was looking for the sweet dressing that always comes on that salad.  Again she argued that it was the shallot dressing.  Ugh!  At this point I am not happy.  I told her to please just make the salad the way that they would normally make it and if she could please put it in a to-go box because I am not late getting back to work! About 5 mins later the Manager walked out with my salad.  I pointed to the yellowish dressing drizzled on the plate (which wasn't on the first plate) and asked him what that dressing was called.  He responded with the name (which I have now forgotten).  In any case it wasn't the Shallot dressing that the server kept arguing with me about.   Now mind you when my salad arrived at the table my mom and son (who both eat really slowly) were both done with their lunches.  I ended up having to take my salad to-go and eating at my desk.   Bottom line...the Manager was very nice (I think his name is Frank).  The server was snotty and extremely unprofessional.  I was really disappointed.   I am only updating to 2 stars because the Manager was very nice and helpful.
Adriana V.,"La Habra, CA",69,17,6,5.0,3/21/2015,"First time  here and  I love it here. Got the avaacdo egg rolls ,  stuffed  mushrooms,  and calamari.. and all was delicious.  Ordered the hibachi steak, and by far the best steak ever!"
Robert C.,"Riverside, CA",16,19,,5.0,11/29/2014,"Just had the most wonderful lunch at the Cheesecake Factory! I had the house salad to start with, then Ribeye steak with a side of Broccoli! My friend had the soup and salad. All the food was fresh and very tasty! I told Noah our waiter that I was on the Atkins Diet and was very understanding and helpful! Noah brought everything we needed right away! Water glass and diet coke never ran dry! Steak was cooked just the way I had ordered it, and Noah even put up with my joke ""Hey Noah, it's gonna rain this week, are you ready?"" He laughed just as if he'd never heard that before!"
