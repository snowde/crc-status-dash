Melissa J.,"Lodi, CA",39,67,125,4.0,10/18/2013,"We ended up here, battling traffic on the way home after a full day at Long beach Aquarium. 3 adults 1 kid, appetizer, dinner,drinks,dessert, only a 15 minute wait on a Saturday night. $140. I'd say we did pretty well. Our server was a little flighty but my forgiveness was high since I didn't think we would get seated that fast. Drinks: cocktails: Firefly...wooo. nice! Appetizer: Nachos were acceptable and what you would expect in quality and quantity for the price My turkey burger was really big and I actually took half of it home with me so I could save room for dessert. Kid had mac n cheese. looked rich and creamy and she gave it a thumbs up. Gumbo was also ordered. Had some kick to it and it looked a little thin, but the adults were happy with the portion.  Dessert was MACKIN. Pumpkin cheesecake, Strawberry Shortcake, Chocolate cake..my God, all Good. Yup. Good experience Yup. we'll be back"
April A.,"Murrieta, CA",6,32,8,2.0,4/22/2016,"2 stars only for the food.I'd like to give more stars being as Cheesecake Factory is my favorite place to eat, but the service was TERRIBLE. We waited less than 5 mins to be sat. We ordered as soon as our waitress came and also ordered waters. 15 mins later still no drinks or bread. The previous check was still left on the table for $83 and NO TIP. Red flag. Our waitress finally brought drinks and left no straws or bread and I had to ask again politely. 20 mins later she said our food order was in and should be out in a few. Another 12 mins went by and she came back and apologized saying she didn't put our food order in and it's going to be a delay! She offered soup but we rejected the soup and I told her it was my birthday so she said they'd make it better for me. She comes out 17 mins later with my husband's food and not mine. I had to wait another 15 mins or so for my food to be dropped off at my table by another waiter. It was flaming hot so I couldn't even eat it for a while. By this time we were really angry so we asked for a manager who didn't even introduce himself but just asked what's going on so we told him in detail and he said ""ok I'll talk to her"" then walked off so I called him over and said ""can we have a different waitress please"" that was it! I'm not even exaggerating we were there almost 2 hours and my toddler was very antsy. We just wanted to leave! Then when they came to sing happy birthday they brought over our original waitress  how awkward for us both! HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT and AWFUL management. Our new waitress was really nice but..still lagged behind. Completely unnecessary. We drove almost an hour there for a nice birthday and I regret it."
Marie R.,"Riverside, CA",0,14,,5.0,10/8/2015,"This Cheesecake is my favorite one. The food is great and big portions. When the office staff wants to eat out I always suggest the Cheese.  Yes, sometimes it's crowded but the staff are trying to get you seated as quickly as space becomes available. Servers greet you nicely, even explain in detail when they answer my questions, the pay attention to my order, the soups are fab, coffee and cream is great. I've been here for fast lunch time meals and always take some of my meal to go, and I've been there with friends for more intimate dining and get great food and service. I've actually seen how rude customers can be to the servers and I wonder how servers get through it but Cheesecake goes out of their way to accommodate them.  It's so sad that customers take advantage of a great restaurant. I hadn't had time to write a review for Cheesecake but I'm glad I'm finally writing it."
Ashley K.,"Riverside, CA",172,24,12,5.0,4/25/2015,Had a gift card so we came in to get some yummy food. Not my first time here but I always enjoy it. We always get great service and the food is so tasty. The best part is when I go on my diets they still have yummy food for me to eat.
Vickie M.,"Riverside, CA",2,6,4,5.0,12/27/2013,"I had the best time at the cheesecake factory today. My waitress was super friendly and efficient. Our service was fast and our drinks were always full. Ask for Jen, she's hilarious and knows what good service is all about!  ""Seinfeld, four!""  ""you can't eat this soup standing up, your knees will buckle."""
Tiffany B.,"Riverside, CA",9,39,46,5.0,4/20/2015,"We eat here often so this is not a one time review, but the accumulation of experiences. I have always been more than happy With the service here.  I am always greeted with a warm smile and all the servers I've had been very efficient and friendly. Although their main menu is very high in the fat and calorie content, happily they have a skinny licious menu that is really amazing.  There is a chicken pasta that has fresh garlic basil and tomato and I still can't figure how it could be under 500 calories. However, if you're looking to splurge on calories, their chicken Madera is to die for! It is it chicken breast that is a grilled, the top is layered with asparagus and cheese, then topped off with a gorgeous mushroom Madera sauce. Of course to keep the calorie content even higher it is served with mashed potatoes. It is absolute joy in your mouth And you could seriously split it with three people.  Tonight I had my best experience ever so I really wanted to give kudos where kudos are deserved. Our hostess was named CHELSEA She was right out of a Disneyland ride. She had the cutest voice and just makes you feel like smiling  when she talks to you.  She started my dinner out feeling happy. Then I got my favorite waiter. His name is CLAY and he is so attentive if you need something you never have to wait long. He scans his guests regularly even when He is walking around Delivering food he has his eyes on the whole room. He makes you feel like you are truly important. We eat out a lot so having a good experience is very important to me. Thank you Cheesecake Factory!"
Brianna K.,"Corona, CA",0,4,,5.0,5/16/2016,Service was great. Darrin was very nice and made nice conversation. Food was good as always. :)
Michael K.,"Riverside, CA",16,75,4,4.0,11/4/2013,"I'm pleasantly surprised to be writing a good review! The chain restaurants at the Galleria tend to be a disappointment, but not this time!  I ordered the ribeye steak with fries. It's one of the more expensive items, so I'm pretty butt hurt when it doesn't taste so great. However, I can honestly say this was worth my 26 bucks. The steak was juicy and delicious and didn't need any A1. the onion rings that came with the fries were to die for! I dipped the onion rings and the fries in the steak juice and it was awesome. I was sad my meal had to end. Our server was attentive despite how busy it was that night -- props to her! She refilled our drinks regularly. I was too full for cheesecake :*( The only thing that made this a 4-star visit instead of a 5-star was the margarita that I ordered. It was pretty watered down (but still tasted good).  I can't wait to come back again for this."
Tim R.,"Riverside, CA",3,46,15,3.0,1/23/2015,"When they say the wait time is 30 min they really mean 60. Still worth the wait, just bring some snacks or buy a pc of cake while you wait."
Hope S.,"Moreno Valley, CA",0,8,,5.0,7/31/2015,Food and service is great as always. Love to try a new flavor of cheesecake each visit. Such a large selection on the menu you can choose from. Yuuummm!!
Lety R.,"Perris, CA",4,2,,5.0,5/7/2016,Food and service was stupendous. My favorite place. Busy today but within 10 min. I had a table.I will be back soon for sure. In luv with the desserts. My favorite is the velvet cheesecake.
Marthie D.,"Los Angeles, CA",521,683,2416,5.0,8/8/2009,"Three of my favorite words: Red Velvet Cheesecake.  It was about time Cheesecake Factory had a cheesecake with red velvet.  So I went here for lunch today. Since it was lunch time, that meant no wait :) Yay. Our server was probably one of the best servers I ever had at Cheesecake Factory: cheery, happy, on time. I hate it when servers/waiters/waitresses take forever to take your order or refill your drinks. I got my typical Miso Salmon, the lunch special. I always think I'll finish the lunch special but never do. BTW, Miso Salmon is probably one of their best plates there. For an, appetizer, the Fried Macaroni and Cheese did the job! Crispy round balls with cheesy noodles on the inside.. YUM! :) Since I never finish my entrees, I made sure I left room for.. drum roll please... RED VELVET CHEESECAKE, their newest cheesecake!  So this is what it is: top layer cheesecake, then red velvet cake, then cheesecake, then red velvet cake. White, chocolate shavings on the back side of the slice and WA-LA, a magical creation waiting to be devoured.  I came.. I ate... I conquered!"
Brandon L.,"Corona, CA",0,12,,1.0,2/8/2015,"My wife and I went here for our anniversary last night, The wait was long but that was expected. Our Server is why I'm leaving the review. Her name is ANA, right off the bat she was rude, when I asked for her help with the menu she basically just Ignored me. She was very Impatient, did not come to the table very many times I sat at one point for 20 mins without water. It's sad that the people that brought the food over Not Ana, were way nicer. I have been here many times and have spent a lot of my money here. I can honestly say I will pass this place by without thinking of returning. There are plenty other restaurants that will gladly take my money and treat me with respect. I would have said something at dinner but would have been extremely rude and embarrassed my wife and her parents."
Sarah C.,"Riverside, CA",47,14,7,5.0,11/13/2013,"The husband and I came in for a dinner date and the food was fantastic! Our server Corie B. was so nice and ""on it"" the entire time. One of the best servers we have had there. Our drinks never got low and our food came out perfectly spaced. Thank you Corie! We will be back again!"
Pablo O.,"Redlands, CA",72,2,,1.0,1/31/2016,They had us waiting over 2 hours to be seated. Got here at 630 and it's now 840. The audacity. The cheesecake is bomb tho.
Raleigh D.,"Temecula, CA",0,24,2,5.0,6/15/2015,"We had the best experience with Shane, the food runner. He was so friendly and truly a delight! One of our fried zucchini's fell, and he brought us back two in replacement because he felt bad. Then, my moms flat bread was slightly smaller than mine. He said he pointed it out to the cooks and they would be making her another one. So we were able to eat the flatbread at the table and box that one to go. He was smiling with an amazing attitude all night. He truly has excellent customer service and made our experience memorable!"
Marlo M.,"Palmdale, CA",17,517,1495,2.0,1/1/2015,Got seated around 9:45 we didn't leave till 11:30 waited for an hour for our food when my meatloaf came it was cold but my wife's pasta was warm they took my plate after telling them came back with fresh mashed potatoes and re heated meatloaf U got an apology from manager I ordered desert I thought they would at least cover that but they didn't this will be my last visit to this location.
Dr. Catherine L.,"Moreno Valley, CA",517,127,93,5.0,3/6/2012,"I am never disappointed when I come here!! I love their ambiance and lighting I love their service and how the waiters introduce themselves or when they switch off I love their unlimited sour dough and honey wheat bread with butter I love their huge portions I love their very reasonable prices I love their cheesecake menu The chicken madeira and ceasar chicken salad are my all time favorites!!!  This is a perfect place to be at with friends, for an important meeting with colleague, or a romantic date!"
Wendy L.,"Riverside, CA",1142,367,3243,1.0,6/17/2013,"1 star because the Yelp details show they take reservations; unfortunately, only during the first hour---and then it's a walk in business. blah!"
Angelica V.,"Riverside, CA",0,2,2,4.0,1/20/2015,"I love this place always amazing, but tonight my avocado egg rolls were disgusting the avocado was bad  :("
