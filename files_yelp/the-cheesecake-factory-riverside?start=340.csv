Nicole M.,"Glendale, CA",386,194,1266,5.0,11/10/2013,"I love the Cheesecake Factory!!! The bread that they serve you before your meal is awesome! I love the brown bread compared to he sourdough. They always serve it fresh and out of the oven. I like their burgers, pasta, salad, Mint green tea, strawberry lemonade, and chicken enchiladas. Their cheesecake is also good. I've tried just about every flavor of cheesecake that they have and I would say the original is the best along with the tiramisu. I Love chocolate but I would advice you to stay away from the Godiva or any other chocolate cheesecake, they taste dry and don't satisfy my chocolate cravings Because they're too sweet! And their service is generally really good. The servers are nice, helpful and attentive!"
Tottianna P.,"South East LA, Los Angeles, CA",1,2,,5.0,8/1/2015,"I love the Cheesecake Factory , the food taste great and their cheesecakes are stupendous . My boyfriend and I go here for dates pretty often lol. It's cute and sets a nice little mood. I usually get the fettuccine Alfred's with chicken and shrimp or the jumbalya pasta which is full of flavor !"
Christina S.,"Riverside, CA",26,20,121,5.0,4/2/2015,Great food and LOVE the people working the bar. So nice and courteous!! Keeps me coming back!
Dora C.,"Fremont, CA",778,227,35,1.0,5/21/2013,"For some reason,  I have never been to a five star Cheesecake Factory.  Their service is terrible.  I went to the Cheesecake Factory on a Friday night with a group of about 30 people.  Having such a big group, of course we reserved a table in advance.  However, this restaurant seemed to bypass the fact that we made reservations, and proceeded to let us wait for TWO HOURS!  That's ridiculous!  At least we got 5 free appetizers...  Don't come here, the wait is too long."
Kris M.,"Corona, CA",37,14,3,3.0,4/12/2014,"Very busy place during the typical rushes, so plan for a slightly early or later meal time, if not expect a long wait, especially on the weekends. Food is good all around, nothing that I wouldn't get again. The best is to do happy hour!"
Marilyn A.,"Walnut, CA",0,11,,1.0,10/12/2016,"Today, I invited my girl friend to lunch.  We went to the Cheesecake Factory on Tyler Street in Riverside. My friend ordered a hamburger, well done.  Unfortunately, her hamburger was so raw inside that it could ""moo.""  If that wasn't bad enough, the service was horrible.  We waited for the check for the longest period of time.  Finally, the waitress came with our bill but never came back to complete the credit card transaction.  By now, I was getting upset with all the wasted time.  Finally, I took the check up to the register to pay my bill.  The cashier was not able to check me out.  I asked to speak with the manager.  This woman couldn't understand why I was upset.  Even after I explained to her the events that had led up to me asking for her, she proceeded in a slow manner to fix the situation.  Again, it took more time.  She had to find the waitress and have her reverse her transation before she was able to adjust the bill.  She had an ""attitude"" and could care less about getting me out of there.  I regularly eat at this restaurant chain, but never experienced this kind of service before. If the manager doesn't care, why should the help be any different."
Alyssa M.,"Wildomar, CA",0,10,1,4.0,12/21/2014,"MMMMMM..... Will never stop going to this place. The portion sizes are big and they serve really good food. My fav is the spicy chicken burger If you've never gone here, it's time to try it! You'll see what I'm talking about"
Jason R.,"Riverside, CA",164,13,1,5.0,5/31/2015,"This is one of my favorite places to eat. The service is always great and the food is amazing. The food can be expensive if you get appetizers, a main course and cheesecake. I think the price you pay is worth it. It's also fun just to go and have a couple of drinks at the bar. The only bad thing is that if you go on a Friday night expect to wait awhile for a seat. I have never had a bad experience here. I recommend this place to everyone."
Joanna N.,"Riverside, CA",5,51,8,3.0,3/8/2015,"Food great ,love the curbside takeout, very extensive menu, pretty pricy for a sandwich on toast"
Gina T.,"Moreno Valley, CA",399,32,25,5.0,6/9/2013,I really love this place the food the staff the whole setting and the one slice of cheese cake you can share with 3 people. :) great drinks too and perfect place to have a birthday celebration :)
David T.,"Riverside, CA",1,37,,1.0,3/16/2013,"RUDE AND INCONSIDERATE HOSTESS LOSES A LOYAL CUSTOMER! The food in the past has been your standard Cheesecake Factory variety, but the hostess has turned us off to the chain forever.   My lady and I wanted a late lunch/early dinner meal, and waited ten minutes for a table.  When called upon, we were escorted to the table right next to the bathroom in the bar area.  I could clearly see a booth unused and clean a few tables over, and asked for that table.  The hostess stated lamely ""oh, that is reserved already.""  We accepted that as an answer, and went back to the waiting area.   The hostess took the next party of two (who were listed after us), and we figured the hostess would place the party at the table by the bathroom we declined.  WRONG!  She seated them at the nice ""reserved"" table that I requested.   Nice going CF!  I have patronized your restaurants for over 20 years, but no longer thanks to a hostess that decided to treat us like morons.  I advise patrons to visit Red Robin instead, which although is believed to be ""less classy"", at least has a hostess that gives a damn about their customers."
Gene S.,"Riverside, CA",1,22,9,4.0,5/23/2015,"Ordered the Cuban Sandwich and good god it was such a perfect choice. Our server was great with giving us her opinions on some of the dishes we were curious about. She was very honest and make our experience that much better. Back to the Cuban Sandwich. Simply delicious, the beef with the mustard and pickles simply complemented themselves in a fashionable manner. I recommend the dish and location to anyone! Only reason I don't give the last star is because I could barely see what I was eating! Turn the light up guys, this is not a nightclub hahaha"
Walter E.,"Fontana, CA",42,22,35,5.0,2/15/2015,"The food was great!! The waiters did an awesome job. All though they were really busy, everything went really smooth and we were taken care of. Didn't have room for cake after food."
Denise T.,"Riverside, CA",101,12,4,1.0,2/18/2016,"Service was awful! We came to celebrate my nephews birthday. I went with a group of 13, 7 of them being kids. From the time we ordered, the food didnt come until 60 min later and they messed the orders up. We had to ask them to bring the kids meals. They made an error on my nephews order so he was the last kid to eat while the others were finished. I ordered fries with my meal that I never received, my sister in law never got her salad, my sister had uncooked potatoes in her mashed potatoes, my daughter got her order when everyone was done and they forgot her fries though they brought them after I complained to the manager Joe. The manager was not professional, he came to the table, listened to our complaints then said he was going to get my daughters fries. He never came back! Then they came at the end and brought us a free piece of cheesecake, telling us it was for the mix up and we sang to my nephew. They brought the tab and had the price of the ""free"" cheesecake but then deducted it. Why......so I can see they discounted something! I was upset for the price we paid!"
Stephanie R.,"Riverside, CA",0,1,,1.0,7/3/2015,"If I could choose no stars I would. I came here last week hoping for an amazing experience since a lot of my friends talk about this place, but I was beyond disappointed. The staff made me feel like I was being rushed to order and when my food came it didn't taste freshly cooked it tasted like if it were sitting for 20 minutes after it was cooked. The only thing I enjoyed was the cheescake, but the visit was not worth it."
Bard M.,"Canyon Lake, CA",3,85,1,3.0,3/3/2014,"We were there last night for my sister's birthday party. Our server was excellent but there was a busboy with a seriously bad attitude. He was extremely rude to our server and put a table down on my foot. I was going to say something to him but didn't get a chance. He was rushing around getting in everybody's way. It was annoying. I understand being efficient but when you're hurting the customers and have a crappy attitude, that's not conducive to good service. The food is always good but bad experiences are remembered most."
Cleo P.,"BOWLING GREEN, NY",0,13,,1.0,9/28/2015,Too expensive for food that has no quality.  Ordered calamari for appetizer and tasted like paper.  Ordered 2 drinks that were good but nothing special. Menu didn't have prices of alcoholic drinks so they can trick you.  Don't spend your money here for those prices since they don't know the meaning of good food.
Diana L.,"Riverside, CA",40,46,45,5.0,12/17/2014,"I love Cheesecake Factory! I usually order the Louie salad, never disappointing. Matt was a great waiter. I went in on my birthday. He wished me happy birthday a few times. Made me a bit sad they didn't sing to me tho.... But overall great service, great food!"
Michelle H.,"San Diego, CA",84,246,58,3.0,5/14/2013,"We had a nice time at this location--having visited one at Victoria Gardens and another in the OC it's all pretty standard. We visited for a late lunch (a surprise for my mom for an after mother's day...no crowds lunch). So, the restaurant was rather empty. Our waitress was nice and attentive so zero complaints.  Our biggest problem was with cleanliness--two of four bread dishes were dirty and all of our forks had to be replaced (so that was a star taken from the rating). And, the second star was for finding short strand of hair in my mom's tamale cakes. Realizing our waitress took a break...or...left...and no one else in our area I had to go up to the hostess and ask for a manager...who took the plate and we received a full discount. He was professional about the whole matter, we paid and left."
Todd R.,"Upland, CA",21,25,11,3.0,1/8/2012,"Bring your thinking cap and a huge appetite. Menu = HUGE It is really too much to choose from. Portions = HUGE I have yet to finish a plate of food here. They should cut the portion in half AND the price. If you compare the amount of food you get with the price, it's really not too pricey. However, you may be shocked at the prices if you are unaware of this fact. On to the food itself. It's really good! And the cheesecake lived up to the hype (and I'm a cheesecake snob)"
