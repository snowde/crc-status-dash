Kyle C.,"Norco, CA",0,2,,1.0,6/21/2014,"I made this account just to write a review about how bad i was treated at this place. My girlfriend and I went in for an early dinner on her birthday. we were seated at the same crappy seats we're always seated in by the servers POS systems. (very impersonal) Aside..from the bad seating section where they sit all the young people who they ASSUME aren't going to tip.  Our server, was an older lady with dark hair, was EXTREMELY pushy, and impatient. She gave us our menu, NO JOKE! came back in 30 seconds and asked us if we were ready to order...anyone who's been to this place before knows how gigantic that menu is. We politely told her we need more time. ONCE AGAIN! not less than a minute goes by, she's back with an even shorter attitude asking if we were ready to order. I was irritated right then and there, but i'm pretty patient as i know serving can be a very stressful job. We told her what we wanted, then she gave us this very pissy look... while saying ""do you want the full portion or the lunch portion?"" as if we couldn't afford it. and i almost came unglued and she could see it on my face. I said THE FULL portion please...FOR BOTH OF US. she walked away with an even poorer attitude. and made the whole time spent there quite awkward. It then dawned on me, the reason for the rushed service, was because she assumed we were coming in at the last minute for lunch specials to get a cheaper bill, and that if we didn't get the cheaper price (like some difficult customers do) we'll bitch about it and she won't get as big of big of a tip. I AM A GENEROUS TIPPER, ALWAYS. Even if the service isn't that great. BUT this is the one time i really really felt like leaving nothing. BUT NO. I'm not like her. her shitty attitude didn't keep me from being a decent person. a generous tip was left, despite being treated like two young children looking for the cheapest meal we can get.  My girlfriend enjoyed going there for her birthday every year, but no more. we're both never going back. we are quite easy customers i might add, quiet, patient, not picky, generous tippers. but this lady needs to find a new job. don't put your poor attitude on good people. not all of people who go out to eat are shitty people."
Adrian C.,"Riverside, CA",0,5,1,5.0,2/16/2016,There is nothing in this menu that I don't like.   As with all large chains sometimes the wait is long but the portions are large and food is outstanding.  Love the Jambalaya!
Jane C.,"Corona, CA",2,89,9,2.0,1/2/2016,"I wasn't impressed with this place. When I first walked in around 6:30 last night, I smiled at the hostess while I was walking up to her. She made eye contact but didn't smile back or greet me. I asked her where take out was, she didn't speak at all. She just pointed in the direction of where take out was with a very serious face. I went up to take out and ordered what I wanted. The girl at the cashier was much nicer. The food was't good at all. I had ordered the Louisiana Chicken Pasta. I thought that it sounded really good. But it was extremely greasy. The pasta was smothered with oil & barely had any sauce at all or any flavor. All I could taste was the oil. The chicken was oversalted.. I came here for nothing because I ended up throwing my food away....Not worth the 20 minute wait and the $22. I feel like I can't even enjoy most chain restaurants these days. Most of their food is always too greasy and too salty."
Rayne B.,"Riverside, CA",195,4,,4.0,3/24/2015,"The food was very good and the service was good too. 4 stars since I can't complain about anything. It was enjoyable. It's quite pricey but if you're willing to spend a bit of money, it's worth it."
Jezebelle G.,"Havelock, NC",9,1,,2.0,8/24/2015,"Second time I have been to the cheese cake factory and honestly the second time was no bueno I had the Italian sandwich and I so happen to look under the bread and there was green stuff and manager told that when they prepared my sandwich on the same board as the guacamole like really he was very apologetic and he had my sandwich remade so in the end it was an ""eh"""
Chris O.,"San Diego, CA",197,10,4,2.0,3/3/2016,I went there for the first time in a while about 2 weeks ago. So let's start with the good and why this got 2 stars instead of 1. The food was amazing. We went for the Sunday brunch and got the monte cristo.. Oh it was so good I might actually go back. Why it got so low of a rating is the wait staff. We saw our waitress a total of 3 times. 1- Right after we sat down. 2-When she took our drink and food order. 3- when she brought us the food. After we got our food she vanished without a word. About 20 minutes after we finished our food and we were looking around for our waitress another waiter walked up and gave us a bill... Now the bill he set down wasn't ours and after we got it corrected it took another 15 minutes for him to pick it up. This was THE WORST WAIT STAFF EXPERIENCE I HAVE EVER HAD AT A RESTAURANT.. we almost walked out but I hate and despise people that dine and dash. The total time we waited at our table for the waitress was ridiculous and I WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND THIS RESTAURANT TO A FRIEND.
Chereese H.,"Menifee, CA",0,5,1,4.0,7/30/2016,"Tonight my husband and I dined at the Cheesecake Factory on Tyler. We chose to sit and eat at the bar because the wait was shorter given the 1/2 off cheesecake sale and how packed the restaurant was. The food was great and of good quality. We were full from our entree's and decided to get our Cheesecake to go(Oreo & Dutch Apple), the bartender confirmed twice what kind we wanted given the level of noise. We live 45 minutes away from this restaurant(Menifee) and to our surprise when we got home we had a Smores and what looked like German chocolate flavored cheesecake(btw I hate German chocolate cake, so I definitely wasn't eating that!) I called the restaurant immediately and spoke with the Manager Joe who was very courteous, professional, & had excellent customer service; he immediately apologized for the mistake and offered a customer friendly solution. I gave this review 4/5 for the minor mishap, but overall Joe was great and so was the food!"
Liz O.,"Seattle, WA",678,808,67,3.0,8/17/2011,"Well, what do you expect from a place called The Cheesecake Factory?  Their cheesecake is great, but everything else is subpar.  I've eaten at least three different meals here, including their orange chicken and their chicken marsala, chicken & biscuits... maybe I should stay away from their chicken items? They've all lacked flavor to the extreme.  Sad because their presentation is so great... and the portions are large.  So for outstanding service, good cheesecake, and bringing warm bread with butter out before the meals - I'm giving the place 3 stars.  Just don't come here for their entrees!  Stick to the cheesecake."
Geoffrey F.,"Chino, CA",194,29,3,5.0,12/4/2013,"I don't normally name drop, but Nicholas K. was awesome! I'm updating my previous rating from 4 to 5 thanks to him. My girlfriend and I thoroughly enjoyed having him as our server and the food was great, as usual!"
Ray S.,"Riverside, CA",0,30,,5.0,8/14/2014,"Took my wife out to dinner here last night. Our waiter, Rob, was just excellent.  He tended to our every need. A bit of a wait to get in but it was well worth it.  The food is always very tasty. We shared a Godiva cheesecake for desert and simply loved it. My wife was very happy and happy wife = happy life.  Thanks Rob."
Mike S.,"Grand Terrace, CA",27,1,,1.0,7/20/2015,"Well where do I begin? Went with wife for dinner we  were seated withing 5 min server takes our order. We get the appetizer fairly quick 40 min later our meals still no show. We ask the waitress where our order was,she goes back to check still nothing. I observed the staff looking in our direction with confusion. 10 min out come the meal barley warm. I was very upset I ask for manager out come a Asian gentle speaking politely. Keep in mind it's been over 30 min that we ate our appetizer so not even hungry anymore so just over it. He trys  to correct  and have new ones made. How frustrating is it. We didn't want anything. He has the nerve to say I took care of the bill you just have to pay the appetizer  and a beer.. lol how is that taking care of us when that's the only thing that came out right??  Anyways  I'm over this place esp this location!!!  Bottom line if you want to chance it go for it and waste your time and money. Your better off eating at some drive thru."
Casper F.,"Riverside, CA",0,13,3,1.0,2/9/2016,I've been waiting for a table for a hour and thirty mins . thanks. For trying. It was my wife's birthday. It was ruined. And when we called to make a reservation you said you don't do that. So we will most likely never come back not worth it. Foods not worth it anyway.
Tat T.,"Menifee, CA",1,11,75,5.0,1/28/2014,Cheesecake Factory is so good it never disappoints  and the atmosphere at the Tyler one is laid back and chill. Cheese cake!!!!!!! u can't go wrong.
Brian B.,"Riverside, CA",74,48,10,4.0,8/30/2014,"Most of our visit have been good, and of course great cheesecakes. I have had the BBQ Chicken Salad in the past, it's really good but surprisingly high calorie for a salad and you can't really save part of a salad. A Half salad might be better if you are watching your nutrition.     Also have had the chicken sandwich, the breading is a little heavy and not always the best cut of chicken.       A great cost effective choice that we have had sometimes is two appetizers. One is a Garlic Cheese Bread with parmigiana/Olive Oil and Marinara Sauces. The other is 4 Chicken sandwich sliders that come with tomatoes, pickles and mayo and a thousand island type special mayo.     The service can be a toss up but more often it's been good for us.     It's at a mall near a curve so watch out for crazy drivers"
Baikal P.,"Anaheim, CA",150,39,12,5.0,10/5/2013,try bistro shrimp pasta and white chocolate raspberry truffle.  I always order those
L. D.,"San Diego, CA",60,143,883,2.0,5/1/2014,"Walked into the cheese cake factory last wkend in a group of 7 adults  When we went up to give our name for a table, we were never given an estimated wait time.  The girl forgot to give us a pager/buzzer and we had to go back to remind her to give us one.  She asked if we wanted to be seated inside or outside and even though it was a bit chilly, we figured we'd take an outside table since she told us the wait was less if we sat outside.  We waited for nearly 1 hr waiting for a table while we noticed many others were being seated quickly.  We finally had to go and 'demand' that we be seated by putting a couple of tables together or to separate us into two tables.  Only reason I'm giving them a 2 star rating is because our waitress was courteous and efficient and the food was decent."
Jack X.,"Pomona, CA",9,72,73,1.0,5/17/2014,"We were seated right away, but it took the waitress 15 minutes to come and asked for our drink order, but fine at least we had our menus and we're ready to order. Once the the food arrives the ""medium rare"" $20 stake was not only overcooked, it was burned. Definitely not coming back to this location."
Darwin C.,"Ontario, CA",10,3,,5.0,1/1/2015,"Love the service & food! Went there for a birthday lunch on December 31st, 2014 with my mom & my daughter. My server was Aldo. Great guy! He and the other staff including kitchen personnel's are very attentive, alert, fun, upbeat and professional.  I don't often recommend places but the service my mom & I  as well as my 3 yr old daughter received was exquisite! My bill wasn't cheap but my mom treated me and gave him, our server/ waiter, Aldo, a well-respected & descent tip. My mom knows about me when I receive great service, as a consumer or as an employee and knows I would've tip him a lot more. Service is everything when you're willing to spend your hard earned money."
Macy M.,"Corona, CA",2,1,,1.0,1/19/2015,"Worst food ever!!!  I would like to say this place was great but unfortunately it wasn't.  The fish tacos had some fish, so I think the small white pieces were fish (couldn't tell).  Kids Mac and cheese, we'll let's say we got more then Mac or cheese .  Everything came out cold, so if there was any good flavor it was lost in a cold chill.  Overall very disappointing, however I don't want to leave on a bad note.... The beers were nice and cold."
Natalie G.,"Victorville, CA",214,175,76,1.0,7/24/2012,"So I decided to come to this place one more time to see if I was a little harsh on them and I realized I made a huge mistake.   1. I called to make a reservation for my Graduation dinner day before my graduation date and they told me they do not take reservations at all. They made this very clear to me on the phone.  2. The next day after I graduated, my family and I went to cheesecake factory and they handed us the beeper and told us it would be a 10 minute wait. ....we end up sitting there for 45 minutes and we go back to the host to see whats going on and the manager comes to us saying the wait will be an hour to 2 hours. .... we ask why we were told the wait was 10 minutes and they said because there were reservations made. This ticked me off because I called in advance asking about when and how I can make a reservation....I told the manager about this and he still refused to seat us even with all the open seating. We ended up leaving this place ticked off and very hungry. DO NOT GO HERE GO TO THE CHEESECAKE FACTORY IN RANCHO CUCAMONGA THEIR SERVICE IS 10X BETTER AND THE SAME DISTANCE FROM UCR."
