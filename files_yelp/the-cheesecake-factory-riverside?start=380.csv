Lieu V.,"Riverside, CA",98,56,162,2.0,5/13/2013,"I haven't been to Cheesecake Factory in years but the family decided to dine here for Mother's day because we didn't feel like making the drive out to OC or Rowland Heights. Cheesecake is located next to Macy's of the Galleria Mall; it's not attached but literally next to Macy's. 3 stop intersection is a high traffic area so I recommend turning into the first right turn possible should you enter the mall from Tyler St. We came a little after 7 and parking wasn't bad but there were a lot and I mean A LOT of groups waiting to dine. We'd resigned ourselves to having to wait a while when the mgr said we could be seated right away if we didn't mind dining in the outside patio area. Mind you, it was high 90° weather today but the sun had already begun to set so it was nice to dine al fresco. Our server for the evening was Kevin and he really did his best to give us great service. He had a lot of tables to cover and he was running his butt off so kudos to him. Because you could see how hard he was working, it was ok that there was a wait for our orders to be taken and our drinks to be refilled - he was quick to get our drink orders, appetizer orders and place bread baskets at our table. Service throughout the whole meal was good from him and other servers delivering the food, especially on such a busy night.  The food, hit and miss: Appetizers: Ahi tuna carpaccio and crispy crab wontons. Carpaccio a hit with thinly sliced ahi tuna arranged nicely on a plate, drizzled with an avocado/ wasabi dressing. There was also half of a sliced avocado, pickled cucumbers, pickled ginger, and a ponzu dipping sauce for accompaniments. The wontons were way too heavy with the imitation crab flavor and it overpowered all the other ingredients in the filling. The wontons had a nice crunch and came with a sweet chili dipping sauce. Entrées: Spaghetti carbonara with chicken. Leave the chicken out. It was dry and bland, tasted like it was thrown in as an after thought. Rest of it was great though. Spaghetti was al dente and the sauce was creamy and rich but not overpowering at all. Bistro Shrimp Pasta - If you like a strong lemony flavor, this is your dish. The sauce was very strong on the pesto and lemon, the flavors seemed to compete more than compliment and the shrimp just got lost in the battle. Wasabi crusted ahi tuna- This dish was the biggest disappointment of the night. Reading the description, you think it's going to be a nice thin crispy crust all around the tuna. What came out was a tuna with a thick green paste slathered over the surface and the paste had a grainy consistency and was as thick as the tuna. The fish tasted fine once you took off the paste and the veggies were nicely cooked. Well received entrées were the filet and rib eye (can't really go wrong cooking a steak), and the Jamaican black pepper shrimp. Dessert: You can never go wrong with their cheesecakes and we ordered the Pineapple Upside down and Oreo, so good with the former being my personal fave. I remember having better quality food here and only stayed away because the calorie count on their dishes are usually in 1000+ range. They have a skinnylicious menu now with offerings under 600 calories. I'll probably come back and give it a try sometime. Perhaps the quality of food was off due to high volume traffic. Guess we'll see."
Ray N.,"Rosemead, CA",638,502,122,5.0,8/17/2010,"Ah, I can't believe I haven't written a review for this amazing restaurant yet-- I've gone here numerous of times, especially for their lunch menu because it's a lot cheaper than their dinner prices. Nonetheless, the environment here is also very relaxing with dim lights for a romantic dinner or just a spot to play catch up with a friend. Basically, this place suits a gathering for all occasions. More importantly, the food here is terrific with a broad range of variety from pasta to glamburgers to even Asian entrees! With that being said, my favorite entree that I constantly get would be: (1) CHICKEN BELLAGIO-- a pasta dish @ $12.95 filled with pesto noodles, chicken, cheese, spinach, and some sort of ham. With these ingredients all mixed in together, this dish never fails to disappoint. On top of that, I guarantee you will be full by the end of the night. Trust me, this dish gives you so much that sometimes I have to box it -- and I hate to box away my food! (2) LUAU SALAD-- this salad is only good and worth it during lunch time for ~$10. It's basically like a Luau party in your mouth-- bursting with flavors from their fruits in this salad such as mango, hint of macademia nuts, and tender chicken breast. On top of that, there's a big fried wonton chip that adds a fun mix to this salad. Whenever I'm craving a salad that is refreshing and fun, this would be the one I turn to. As for the rest of the dishes, they do some justice. The fried mac & cheese is definitely one of the most unique appetizers I have ever had. On the other hand, the Steak Diane is pretty expensive, but definitely delicious with small pieces of steak and baked veggies.  For dessert, I prefer the CRAIG'S CRAZY CARROT CAKE CHEESECAKE. Trust me, this is one of the most amazing-est cheesecake you'll ever experience. Everrrrrrr. However, the pricing for the cheesecake is ~$10 a slice. Pretty pricy, but worth it. For the drinks-- they're all pretty epic and doesn't have the nasty alcoholic taste. The price range for drinks is ~$9-12. For starters, try the Peach Martini(?) or the Typhoon. They are BOTH such amazing, fruity, and delicious drinks!  But whether it's an appetizer or an entree, most of these dishes comes in a huge portion. However, for the price you pay-- you better get a good deal on the food here. The pricing here is definitely not in the affordable range, but it's worth it for what you pay for. Oh, and the service here is always on point. They're always friendly and attentive on your needs. Thus, I will and always be a huge fan of this chain restaurant. Low lights: - Pricing. High lights: - Amazing food. - DELICIOUS ALCOHOLIC DRINKS! - Attentive service."
Morgan B.,"Phoenix, AZ",5,3,,1.0,7/13/2015,"My boyfriend & I dined here last night, July 12th, & it was quite possibly the worst dining experience we've had. I have worked in the restaurant industry for over 5 years now & have hosted, served, & bartended so I'm very understanding that a server may be busy or may be having an off day, things happen I get that. However, our server Ana F. was completely awful. First, we waited over 5 minutes to be greeted, when she did finally approach our table she didn't say hello, ask how we were, or even introduce herself (I only know her name cause I looked at the receipt), she said, ""what do you want to drink?"" Then immediately asked ""so you ready to order?""...I was in such shock with her attitude I had no words. She then dropped off stale bread with no butter & went missing for another ten minutes. The food was good, as usual (except the bread), and the gentleman who ran our food was really personable, I really wish he had been our server. I've dined at multiple Cheesecake Factories across the U.S. & this experience was so disheartening & ruined any chance of me ever returning."
Emily K.,"La Habra, CA",12,69,5,4.0,1/1/2013,"My husband and I came here for dinner on New Year's Eve.  we arrived at 5, hoping to beat the crowds, but the restaurant was already very full with people waiting.  However, we were seated at a table a mere 5 minutes after we put in our name. Our waitress, Deanna, was right with us to take our drink orders and bring us bread.  She came right back when we told her we were ready to order.  We ended up ordering two appetizers/snack plates - the crab bites and the fried cheese.  Both were brought quickly, and both were delicious!  Our appetizer (we split) - the farfalle with bacon, peas, mushrooms in a cream sauce - came quickly and was piping hot.  We both thought it was delicious. We asked Deanna to bring boxes for our leftovers, which she did promptly.  She boxed our food then took our cheesecake order.  My husband ordered the Adams (a family favorite), and I tried the Oreo.  Both were fantastic.  I'm looking forward to eating the remnants of mine later today! Two notes I would like to make:  1) The bathroom was pretty messy, but I assume that is because the restaurant was so busy no-one had had time to service it recently.  2) Several servers came to our table with food that wasn't ours, and took our food to the table beside us before realizing it was ours.  I'm not sure if they number tables or what but they could work on that a bit so that there is minimal confusion when the restaurant is crowded.  It wasn't a big deal, just a note. Overall, our food was delicious and our waitress, Deanna was great.  She was friendly, quick, and helpful.  I have always liked the Cheesecake Factory and I'm sure we'll be back."
Yoly G.,"Moreno Valley, CA",2,14,10,5.0,1/11/2015,Thank you cheesecake for taking care of us.  They gave us very bad service however corporate called me and sent me a $50 gift card for their bad service.  They really want me to try their restaurant again because they made a mistake.  So I did and they impressed me.  Thank you.  I did send them an email of the great experience I had to them.
Carlo G.,"Murrieta, CA",0,10,,4.0,2/11/2014,"The name says it all! CHEESECAKE! Yes, they know how to do the cheesecake in the utmost superb fashion. The entrees are also quite good. Nice atmosphere. I've only been there for lunch, and it's buzzing with people at that time of the day."
Autumn Y.,"Berkeley, CA",16,29,29,5.0,5/5/2013,"I've enjoyed coming here every single time. The gumbo, with white rice and a side of sour cream is HEAVENLY. I've had the jambalaya as well - its also good, but I preferred the gumbo. They both use different spices. The calamari is delicious, as well as their southwest chicken eggrolls. My boyfriend really liked the buffalo chicken blasters! They have great service - the waiters are always prompt and professional. The only complaint I would have had is that the utensils look a bit splotchy, but i'm sure they're clean. the cheesecake is excellent, but that goes without saying.  With an appetizer and two entrees, the total usually comes to about $45 - $55."
Juana B.,"Riverside, CA",0,78,24,4.0,12/2/2015,First time ordering fish tacos. Got them grilled. They were delicious. My rice was kinda hard and disappointing. My daughters mac and cheese was salty and so was my sisters spaghetti. The kids chicken sliders were real good and tender. And the service? Excellent. She was so friendly and on top of everything.
Jeanilee S.,"Moreno Valley, CA",190,238,43,5.0,6/27/2010,"From the moment we walked in the service was great.  I came here on a Sunday afternoon with the fam.  Our waitress was very attentive and had our drinks out really quick.  We ordered the crab wontons as an appetizer which were DELICIOUS. Next up was my entree which was the California Cheesesteak.  Presentation was nice, the fries were good, and so was the cheesesteak but it wasn't anything to get excited about.  I actually liked my mom's Steak Diane (I think that's what it's called) better. But anyways, as far as cheesesteaks go, I've had a lot better.   For dessert I ordered the Tiramisu cheesecake to go.  They put a slice of your cheesecake in a little to go box which has a seperate part that holds extra whipped cream.  I thought that was cute.  And the waitress even put in some extra forks and napkins in case I wanted to take a few bites on the go.  How considerate.. she got a nice tip for that along with the great service we had."
Vicky T.,"Santa Cruz, CA",446,2659,990,3.0,5/22/2010,Ended up here with the brother last weekend. I usually do not like Cheesecake Factory but this place was tolerable. Service was decent.. food.... overall this chain prides itself in super large portions and encouraging diabetes. The eggplant sandwich with roasted veggies was good (I could only eat half and gave the rest to my brother for a dorm snack)  The two guys in the group got various hamburgers..  Drinks were refilled... check came quickly...  Not great but not horrible
Tina N.,"Phoenix, AZ",72,46,133,4.0,7/15/2012,"It's been almost a month since I was here, but I can still taste the Gumbo whenever I think of it.  This place was very clean. We were seated at a booth, which for me I do not like. However this booth was comfortable and didn't seem to bother me at all. My friend and her nephew accompanied me here, as it was a payback for a bet won ;).  I opted for the Gumbo. I haven't had really good Gumbo since I moved away from the South. This was so full of flavor, so bold I felt like I had stepped back in time. Or maybe it was simply that I was hungry, haha. I forgot my phone in the car so I didn't get a picture.  The portions were very large, so you knew you weren't walking away hungry. The amount of sausage to shrimp to veggies was equal in proportion to the serving.  Nice amount of brown rice in the center, yummy.  I was able to eat all but a few bites.  My friend ordered butter garlic pasta of some sort for the little one. When it came to the table it looked dry. The server was very attentive and quick to right the wrong. She was also very attentive throughout the meal.  For dessert I had the red velvet cheese cake. Yummy yummy. Mouth watering and filling. Light. I enjoyed the decor within the place as well. I really enjoy art, so looking at the murals and such on the ceiling was relaxing in its own. The lighting wasn't too bright, nor too dim.  I had never ventured into a Cheesecake Factory before, because that is what I thought it was, simply about cakes. Had I known otherwise long ago, maybe I would have had this experience before. Who knows. All in God's time :).  I'll definitely return to The Cheesecake. We have one not to far from home!  Overall a great experience was had by me."
A J.,"San Diego, CA",2,80,25,5.0,12/1/2012,"Had to give this a 5 star review only because it would not be at the top where it would be read because yelp caters to these businesses. On Nov, 23 I was at the CF arriving about 2pm and I purchased $400 of their gift certificates. I had to wait for a table. Yeah, who would think that at that hour there would be anyone eating. I got there intentionally at that hour to avoid the lunch crowd. There were 8 of us in our party. Four of us were there and we ordered two appetizers waiting patiently for the appetizers which didn't show up for a good 25 min, by then my other 4 guests were seated. I hadn't planned on the appetizers taking so long to arrive so that meant that I had to share them with the rest in the group, we barely got an avocado egg roll and some humus.  The waiter Tony J. was not a good waiter nor did he care because if there are 6 or more in your party CF WILL automatically include a 18% gratuity charge on the bill as well as wait for you to give them an additional ""bonus tip."" They won't tell you that when you sit down because they expect you to dig it out from the fine print (per the manager) nor will the waiter tell you up front. My salmon did not taste right and Tony never returned to ask if there was anything wrong or if we needed something like refills. WOW, so after he put the bill on the table and ran, he never mentioned that he had made two charges (one for the food & drinks) and the other for the tip. I asked him why we were charged for an extra drink and he looked around to count then said he would fix it. He came back and I figured he had fixed it. However, today 12/1, after looking at my mother's picture that he took of our group I see that he still had a drink that he overcharged on the bill.  CHECK YOUR BILL carefully especially if it is larger party. I called the manager, Mike, who interrogated me and was more intent as to why I didn't address this in front of my guests AT the time we were there rather than to deal with this situation afterward. I told Mike the service was bad and that by Tony deducting the $22.25 tip from my gift certificates that I had no way to dispute this had it been a credit card. That Tony never mentioned that one was a separate bill for the tip. Mike said he would roll the video tape back (yeah, do you think so?) to see how long it took Tony to get the appetizers to the table and see his lack of service. This gets so old at the CF when a person comes in for the food and has to deal with poor service and  being overcharged on top of that. Don't think that they will believe you even if you have a complaint. CF doesn't care because if you don't go to eat there someone else will. This restaurant has had so many problems with service and wait times that have been brought up by many people (see other comments below) but nothing has been done to resolve this. Apparently, CF doesn't care otherwise they would have fixed these problems. Personally, I don't think a party of 6 is large since my family is a party of 5 kids and 2 parents.  If they feel a need to force a gratuity charge then it should be for a group of MORE than eight and it really shouldn't be forced! This only means that they want to be sure they get extra money for doing less work. IF they feel that their service is so good then their guests would leave the appropriate tip that was deserved by the waiter."
Cindy A.,"Corona, CA",53,152,124,3.0,3/11/2014,"requested a gluten free menu, ordered from the gluten free menu and ate the whole meal.... my son started getting severly bloated and thats when i asked the waitress to double check the order because my son was getting sick... she said, oh im sorry, i forgot to request this, but no need to inform my manager cause he will just take it off the bill. i will take care of this for you right away!""  i wanted to speak to the manager myself instead, i just left my payment and walked out and headed home to take care of my son. my son is only 4 years old and to not take my son's health serious makes me very upset. i hope this was a lesson learned by this waitress and realizes she can severely hurt someone by not paying close enough attention to detail.  2 stars was for the food and 1 for the service."
Ray W.,"Riverside, CA",493,46,29,5.0,9/12/2014,"I've been to a number of these at different cities and I've found the atmosphere, service, food and menu selection to be perfect everytime.  Love it!"
Chris T.,"Riverside, CA",65,124,359,4.0,4/12/2012,"I came on a lunch break for a quick meal. It was a Saturday around 3:30pm. I had originally wanted to come in for their Happy Hour, but that was Monday through Friday only. =( So I settled ordering from their small plates menu and sat at the bar so that I didn`t have to wait for a table. I wanted a light lunch, so i started with the Beets and Goat Cheese. Beets, goat cheese, green apples, candied pecans, and arugula tossed in a delicious dressing. So yummy. After eating that, I was still hungry, so I ordered the Mini Corn Dogs. I love hot dogs, so crispy deep fried battered small hot dogs with ketchup and mustard is something I can`t say no to. So as I`m sitting, I constantly see cheesecakes walk past me. No kidding, it`s The Cheesecake Factory. The bartender hands me a menu and asks me if I wanted to get dessert. I thought about it and ended up getting the Dulce de Leche Caramel Cheesecake. So much for my light lunch. Dulce de Leche Caramel Cheesecake, my new favorite! I`ve always stuck to the Original with Strawberries, but the Dulce de Leche hit a whole new spot! Caramel cheesecake, caramel mousse, vanilla crust, with crunchy candied walnuts and mountains of whipped cream. AMAZING!!"
Lulu S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,50,4,3.0,10/21/2014,"I love cheesecake, so this place is good for my cheesecake addiction.  Food here is good.  But service is so-so.  When I try to buy a whole cheesecake to go, the cashier person behind the counter was not helpful and gets a bit annoyed with me when I asked her about the different kind of cheesecake and the flavor."
Dawn M.,"Corona, CA",50,42,5,4.0,10/19/2014,"This is the BEST Cheesecake Factory that I go to.  The Food is ALWAYS CONSISTENT.  If you frequent CCF then you know this is not always the case. But this one is always great.  Don't really care for the location (being it is in the mall parking lot, very hard to find parking), and the restroom situation is really crazy.  I think they have 3 max stalls for women in a restaurant this size is pretty outrageous.  This seems to only be an issue at this location.  I love their Stuffed Chicken Enchiladas.  I order it with the cilantro rice instead of the black beans and I cannot get enough of them.  I also love the Orange Chicken and Chipotle Chicken Pasta.  Service has always been great too, so I will be back again and again and again!"
Rick W.,"Los Angeles, CA",355,81,63,3.0,2/28/2013,"This location is in a shopping mall near other restaurants; if you go on a weekend (especially at night) be prepared to park fairly far away and have a decent wait once you arrive.  We stopped in for a couple drinks and dessert at this location, which is what this review is based on. Service was friendly, but our waitress was fairly slow; it's not a huge deal in this case, as we were simply hanging out and having a nice long conversation with friends. I had a booze infused shake, which was yummy - alcoholic shakes are naughty on every level, and I highly recommend one! ANY one! They're all tasty goodness! The rest of our group had various desserts, including of course, cheesecake (Banana Cream, to be exact). All good, and all plates cleaned! I've eaten at other Cheesecake Factory locations from California to Las Vegas; it's pretty much consistent everywhere you go. The prices are a bit high chain-wide, but no one's holding a gun to your head to dine here, you know? A GREAT place to stop and get a drink and dessert. Full meals are always tasty and decent here as well. Just take your patience if you go at busy times; because you won't be alone!"
Patricia R.,"Riverside, CA",19,29,3,3.0,5/15/2014,"Our server Nicole was sweet and always on top of her duties. My only complaint is that the somewhat pricey lunch Salmon comes with a measly 4 asparagus sprigs. Other than that, the Ahi Tartare and the Mai Tai are both ridiculously delicious!"
Jasmin C.,"Fullerton, CA",12,21,,2.0,2/18/2013,"There is a lot of wait time! As in a lot.  I don't mind waiting as long as it's reasonable, but the amount of waiting was just absurd. First, we had to wait for chair for 35 minutes. This wasn't the worst and the wait was fine, Macy's is just nearby so you could kill time there. After we were seated, it took them more than 10 minutes to get back to our table and get our orders. This pissed me out, because it felt like a waste of time. Our food should be cooking by now, you know what I mean? The wait for food was about 10 minutes too or more, but this is understandable.  We asked for honey wheat bread, server said hold on a second. We were forgotten. Server came back in more than ten minutes, said, ""you wanted more brown bread, right?"", takes off with our basket and comes back in less than a minute. What the? If it's that easy to get us bread, why make us wait that long?  I just found it ridiculous. Anyway, I ordered something different. I always have the Cajun jambalaya pasta, now I tried the Da Vinci pasta. It seemed well loved on yelp. Fail! My pasta was way too salty it made my lips feel funny. This was the worst cheesecake factory experience I ever had. I also been to the cheesecake factory in the grove that same week, and that one, I would gladly give five stars. The visit so fresh in my mind, just made this visit at Tyler suck even more."
