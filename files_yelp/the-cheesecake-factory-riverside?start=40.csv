Ellen S.,"Riverside, CA",11,69,7,4.0,7/31/2017,"Overall, as in the name might suggest, the cheesecake is marvelous, in tons of varieties.  The vanilla Bean is great, the Godiva chocolate is also great, the fresh banana cream is wonderful. The white chocolate raspberry is really nice.  The other desert selections are really good as well. The Limoncello cake is really good. I'm not crazy about the coffee, though.  All the desert entrees are at least $7.95. The Cuban sandwich is terrific. The pork is lean and flavorful, it's loaded with pickles and a great mustard sauce. I always request extra mustard. The fillet mignon is a staple, the omelettes are good as well. The appetizers are really good and for happy hour in the bar, selected appetizers and small plates are $5.95-$6.95.  They have a foot-long hotdog on Hawaiian sweet rolls that is really good, for $5.95!!!"

Dinah G.,"Murrieta, CA",1,19,6,2.0,2/10/2017,"We just had a late dinner here on a Friday night came around 10:30-10:45ish- the hostess was nice, told us it was a 5 minute wait but got sat in a minute or two.. Sat down in a nice booth (my fav) then had some lady (not our actual server) to get our drinks she was nice, then 10 minutes later we got our actual server who took roughly 25 minutes to get our drinks and not even the correct order. By this time we have already lost our appetite. Another 15 minutes pass before even ordering our food. Other guest was attended before we were and they came after maybe it's because we look like kids who doesn't tip. And she tended to the older Caucasian folks.  Of course food takes a while but adding onto the actual wait before ordering the food made it a horrible exp. +1 star for food quality"
Brian A.,"Corona, CA",0,4,,5.0,11/5/2017,I recently had brunch here and had Nicole as my server. The food was great and the service was nothing short of outstanding.
Taylin I.,"Los Angeles, CA",100,172,426,4.0,5/20/2016,"One of my favorite chain restaurants because they have so many options and they're all consistently good.  Wait time on Friday evening was about 30 min. Server was really nice.  Drinks: my go to is the pina colada (virgin, because I think it tastes better). The peach bellini was also good last time I had it, but on the sweeter side.  Food: -Avocado egg rolls -Portobello, zucchini, and avocado fries -Shrimp scampi and Steak Diane combo -Strawberry cheesecake All the food was delicious and large portions. I am infatuated with the shrimp and steak combo. The shrimp came perfectly crisp and in a wonderful sauce with huge roasted garlic cloves and fresh tomato bits and it was just so good. The steak was also beautiful with great flavors and a good cook, especially loved the mushrooms on top, they complemented each other perfectly. Avocado rolls come really crispy and with a generous filling of avocado with a really special sauce. The others were good but probably won't grab the fried veggies next time."
Reba Joyce L.,"Riverside, CA",245,46,10,4.0,5/20/2017,"The service here isn't really the best...so impersonal compared to other cheesecake factories...they seem so rushed or stressed or both.  Anyways, aside from going through the motions in terms of service, their food is mouthwatering. Huge portions. Biggest book (literally) of a menu.  I recommend the miso salmon.  Delicate flaky salmon smothered in a sweet miso sauce over a generous glob of rice. Served with peas. Mmmmmm!!!!"
Loan H.,"Riverside, CA",17,20,,2.0,5/14/2017,"Did the curb side service today They took a long time to answer the phone when we placed the order When I got to the parking spot, they took a long time to answer again However they came out quicker than I expected. They handed me a bag that said it had my French fries and utensils. We went through the order and discovered they forgot one of my orders... I paid for my food and was disappointed that they charged me extra for sweet potatoes fries. When I had asked what sides were available they didn't say sweet potatoes fries would be an extra charge. Came home and had no utensils or butter for my bread. I ordered a medium cooked rib bye for my husband which seemed to be well done.... We had mediocre food and service today."
Emily S.,"Irvine, CA",3,47,7,3.0,12/9/2017,"Cheesecake factory is one of my favorite go-to restaurants and the quality of food is usually always consistent.  For some reason this particular location of Cheesecake Factory always has very slow service.  I have come here at least 10 times and most of the visits have resulted in me getting incorrect orders or having a request that was unfulfilled or forgotten.  I am very understating towards servers because I know how hard their jobs are but most of my visits have not been during busy rushes where most of the tables are empty.  During one of my visits my table of two placed our orders and we waited thirty minutes.  After another thirty minutes of our server who only checked in once, we were informed that our server went on break so we would get a new server.  After waiting a couple minutes, we still had not received our food so we asked the waiter to check in and he came back to tell us that our order was never placed at all.  In response to this we were only offered more bread and some salad as an apology.  Our total wait time from when we placed our order to when we got our food was an hour and a half which I thought was ridiculous especially since we were only offered bread and salad for our wait.  I really expected more from a big chain restaurant such as Cheesecake factory.  I still have positive outlook on Cheesecake factory but I really dislike this location due to my bad experiences and the consistent slow service."
Tai T.,"Perris, CA",57,98,46,4.0,6/7/2017,Always happy.  It's Cheesecake Factory.  I'm always so surprised when I see how much foooooood they have.  Choices choices!
Stepheyne C.,"Hemet, CA",94,100,18,4.0,10/4/2017,"I love this place. The decor is great. The cheesecake display, and the changing digital display above, makes your mouth water. We usually order multiple appetizers and are working our way through the list. The beet salad was really good. The friend mac & cheese balls were decent but a little too much batter and crunch. The spring rolls probably aren't something Id order again. The corn tamale cakes are FANTASTIC and a must have every time I go. Any of the cheesecakes are good but I'm a classic Turtle kind of girl."
Danielle V.,"Fontana, CA",35,27,1,5.0,9/22/2017,I am on my lunch....sat in a corner and was waiting for help when a waiter saw me looking around and offered to take my order and even checked on me after was done. Wonderful service from this gentleman. I will definitely be back. His name was Edgar. I will be requesting him the next time I come in
Sheilia B.,"Riverside, CA",0,26,8,2.0,6/23/2017,Order for pick up by door dash Friday 6-23-2017 @ around 1:15. $17.00 Fish and chips. Been getting it here for months. How ever....Today was AWFUL!!!! Who ever was in charge of my order should not have Microwaved my food to DEATH!!! French Fries were like Weapons Hard an Dry!!  My fish was so hard and Dry!!! Coleslaw was perfect as usual!! Bread was perfect as usual!!  Very disappointed in who ever prepared my food.  You owe me Cheesecake Factory!
Patrice G.,"Corona, CA",1,11,3,2.0,10/19/2017,Horrible service. Waited  30 minutes to get seated for lunch.  Then waited 40 minutes to get our food   Once we got the food it was cold.  Had to hunt down the server for refills on drinks and bread.  I'm sure the food would have been good but cold spaghetti and pasta is not very tasty.  I have been to other  Cheese Cake Factory's and all was good. I'm sure this was because of bad management.  Go next door to Red Robin.
Jeremy G.,"Colton, CA",1,36,5,4.0,6/30/2017,"The wait at this specific location seems to be usually bad, as with other Cheesecake Factory locations I've been to, but if you don't mind late lunch, there's usually no crowd around 2-4 on weekdays. Regardless of the wait, my experience with the staff here has always been positive, from the hostesses quickly acknowledging our entrance to waiters getting the orders right. The quality of the food is just as you'd expect from any other location. Always fresh-tasting and pretty in presentation. Granted, I expect those things from a restaurant that I consider somewhat ""higher end"" and a bit on the pricey side."
William M.,"Menifee, CA",0,1,,1.0,10/17/2017,"Terrible Service, awful management, disgusting food.  Drinks are watered down and servers have ghetto attitudes... Don't waste your time dinning at Riverside location, drive 30 minutes up the 15 to Rancho, where the Restaurant isn't ran by staff that does not care. This place is a complete joke....  Complained to Diana which says she was the store manger and she hung up in my face. If you have issues call Corp and complain hopefully they will send the right staff to turn this dump of a location around......"
Erick M.,"Rialto, CA",146,190,223,4.0,2/21/2017,"I went to this restaurant with my sister and brother in law.i had no idea the menu was as big as it was. They had pretty much everything on the menu. The food was good. The restaurant was packed (weekend), and clean. Good restaurant to go to, and will definitely go back."
Erin A.,"Norco, CA",0,27,,5.0,10/12/2017,"We had some absolutely delicious food today. I had the Honey Truffle Chicken and it was amazing! Our waiter Jordan was so very professional, prompt and friendly. It was a very positive experience for my daughter and I. Oh and the Vanilla Bean cheesecake really topped it off... yuummm!"
Tim D.,"Moreno Valley, CA",55,60,103,5.0,9/23/2016,"Corie B. Was our server. Hands down the most polite person I've met here. Which is hard to beat because everyone is super nice. Wife ordered a mint green tea and when it arrived there was no mint in it. I asked about it to make sure it was the correct beverage and Corie informed me that due to her options of the mint leaves she decided to do without it. She said the leaves were wilted and looked old. Instead of her delivering a product that we probably would have sent back anyway, she exercised amazing judgement.  Corie represents The Cheesecake Factory very well. I would never allow my wife to drink something old and wilted and the fact that she made that judgement for me was absolutely amazing. I will be back as we are here often. Very grateful.  Thank you Corie!!!!! Congrats Cheesecake you have a fantastic representative of your brand. See you soon."
Scott B.,"Oceanside, CA",4,71,12,1.0,3/5/2017,"Told ""30-40"" minutes wait.  Turned into 90 minutes!  Never again, no excuses Countless large groups were seated before us despite them arriving after we did.  Extremely frustrating"
Stilly P.,"Riverside, CA",1,17,,3.0,10/7/2017,"I used to hate the Cheesecake Factory. I vowed to not go there anymore because it was so commercialized that the place just screamed out as nothing but advertising whores with food coming second or third on the list that they were good at.  So I reluctantly went last night since it was my mother's birthday and she wanted to go there to eat. I grumbled along the way because when I think of Cheesecake Factory all I can think of is their 90 page menu filled with ads from about 50 other businesses and some of which have NO PLACE in a menu... Well. My previous grumblings (as well as others with the same opinion perhaps?) must have made it to corporate. There was not a single ad in their menu, except to advertise their OWN business which I feel is perfectly fine. It is their menu and they have the right to do what they want (and I have the right to never go again). I had the crispy chicken sandwich, but with some tomato added on and does it really matter the details of everyone's meal? Here is the deal. The food is medium to somewhat pricey. I mean, $13.00 for a chicken sandwich aint REALLY my cup of tea, but it was not too expensive. The chicken portion WAS certainly large and the sandwich was very good.  Food wise- I give them a 7 out of 10 for having above average portions. Value wise I give them a 5.7 out of 10 because their prices are not cheap, but not too expensive.  Ambiance wise I give them a 6.0 out of 10 because there was a group of teens or millennials behind us that kept yelling and shouting to take the picture! Take the picture! Take the picture!  CLEARLY they must not have been able to read the sign outside that said Cheesecake Factory because they thought they were at the Chuck E. Cheesecake Factory with how they were acting. Nobody else complained  I guess and nobody came over to tell them to shut up either... Presentation is where they shine typically though but they make the place so damn dark my mom had to bust out a flashlight to view the menu. I did not go as extreme, but the lighting is certainly a place to take a mediocre chick and make her look almost hot. Presentation gets a 4 out of 10 because they have the place so dark AND because there was a black gnat that I could see hovering over the table (that I swiped at and killed later on).  Had that been a firefly that they had hovering over the table, they would have gotten an 8.5 for presentation because having live fireflies flying around would just be a COOL place to go eat. Even if they had the fake fireflies lights up near the ceiling with the little LEDs and fans to give that firefly ambiance- THAT would be totally cool... In fact, that would be just downright AWESOME. I know they can be way better on presentation though and I intend to return to give them that chance. I see how much time they put into their cheesecakes. I know once they figure out that that same time and application of presentation of the whole place to the customer catches on, that it will be a killer place to go eat... I was just impressed that they removed all of the external advertising from their menu and THAT shortened it down to about 16 pages.  Good for you TCF, now if you could just filter out some of the idiots and noisy jerks that come in... Oh yeah. I almost forgot, they sell Cheesecake slices too. My recco to you is to try a different piece of cheesecake every time you go there, better yet, just go there to order some cheesecake slices. I mean it is cheesecake so how wrong can you go?  This place DOES shine on presentation though and they really enjoy presenting you with various foo-foo types of cheesecake. They have many different flavors from Bacon Blueberry to Unicorn Farts... And, if you have kids that you feel like dragging out with mommy and daddy because you are too damn cheap to get a babysitter- then STAY OUT! We do not want your whiny bratty kids screaming for attention while us Adults are trying to eat and have conversations about other things than sponge bob and u-tube popular channels..."
