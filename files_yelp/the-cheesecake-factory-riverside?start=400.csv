Dylan F.,"Riverside, CA",0,4,,5.0,12/19/2015,We had a waiter from heaven!!! I'm so ashamed that I cannot recall his name but he had dreads . He was attentive our whole evening! ! I couldn't believe how amazing he was that I had to scope out the manager to let him know how appreciative we were for our awesome experience.  We will absolutely be back and hopefully we can get him again!!
Bree T.,"Riverside, CA",73,19,3,3.0,4/26/2014,Called in to make order and was on hold for 7 mins. Not happy with the customer service by phone.
Joseph L.,"Orange County, CA",447,182,805,5.0,2/15/2012,"Had lunch at the Factory today.  The BBQ Ranch Salad was excellent.  Shannon, our server, was great."
Tammy L.,"Fountain Valley, CA",860,819,456,4.0,1/22/2012,"I always liked Cheescake Factory. I've received great service and food quality here. The average price for this excellent quality of food is around $10-$15 dollars for an entree.  The desserts (the Cheesecakes, of course) are anywhere from $6 to $8.  I ordered Crusted Herb Salmon with Steak Diane (a combo plate) that cost $19.95.  They bring out a couple different types of bread before your meal that will hold you over for the 15-20 minute wait for food. Sooo what's for dessert?!  The Ultimate Red Velvet Cheesecake of course! Some say they like it and some say it's overrated but I say who cares what anyone else says..I FREAKING LOVE IT! Can't really say much except that it's a party in my mouth.  try to avoid weekends.. they tend to get crowded!! I love all their cheesecakes. Sorry I just can't choose."
Craig W.,"Long Beach, CA",85,2,,1.0,10/21/2014,"We purchased 1,400 dollars in gift cards to hand out to the teachers of our childrens school. As the teachers tried to use the cards they found out that they were no good. We have talked to the Manager (Mike) several time and the only thing out of his mouth is that i will take care of this and will get back to you.Well its been over 1 year and still no resolve and no refund of my 1,400 dollars. He totally lacks integrity and is a poor representative for the cheesecake factory."
Rebecca N.,"Portland, OR",296,151,448,4.0,11/18/2010,"After a hard working morning at school, the boyfriend and I decided to hit up Cheesecake factory for lunch. Once we entered, we got seated quickly, and our waiter immediately got our drinks and basket of bread. Our waiter was super nice, knowledgeable, and quick. However, it did take him a little while to get our order and refill our drinks. Also, he looked like Tyler Perry. LOL.  The menu for this place is pretty massive. There is a lot of stuff in this menu for anyone's taste. So kudos for a huge menu. The food was really good. The basket of bread comes with molasses bread and sourdough bread. I LOVE THE MOLASSES BREAD! NOOOM! NOOM! And I decided to get the tomato basil pasta. It is penne pasta with tomato sauce, basil sauce, pieces of grilled chicken, and fresh mozzarella. I forgot what the boyfriend got, but it was some kind of chicken that is breaded with lemon sauce and mash potatoes. My pasta was freaking good. All the components from the dish complemented each other really well. And my boyfriend's plate was bomb. I loved what they did to the chicken.  Now, when you come to Cheesecake Factory, you HAVE to get one of their cheesecakes. There is a huge list of them. This time we chose the 30th Anniversary cheesecake, which is a layer of original cheesecake with chocolate cake, and a chocolate truffle cream. I normally don't like cheesecake because I think it is weird how it gives me a sour aftertaste. However, for this cake, I'll eat it anyway because it is so good."
Annie Z.,"Corona, CA",4,4,,5.0,8/25/2014,First time here and we absolutely loved it!! They have great service. We were served by Sereiroumoni and we are definitely coming back! She is really friendly and welcoming.
Heather M.,"Los Angeles, CA",10,17,6,5.0,11/24/2013,"Try breakfast burrito, it was great. the outdoor sitting was pleasant and the service was unbelievable as usual."
Nazeli S.,"Glendale, CA",43,120,4,1.0,5/29/2012,"Worst cheesecake factory experience ever.  We had ordered two plates for a pick up last night and I specifically asked the girl over the phone if she can put the sauce from a steak dish on the side...meaning in a cup.. separately... not on the side of the PLATE that's going to be in a car moving around.  Secondly, she asked me how I'd like the steak cooked and i specified that I wanted mine to be a little pink and the other dish rare.  Well that was reversed.  My order was rare the other was well done? I had gotten the Hibachi steak and the potatoes were not how I remembered them, but it may be that the recipe has been changed. The worst part of this entire meal was how I feel...right now.  I feel sick and nauseous. The mexican food I had at 5am didn't make me feel sick but this expensive meal did? Makes no sense at all."
Vanessa W.,"Riverside, CA",0,2,,2.0,11/13/2015,"Service was good, very friendly and professional..... But my sister and I had the Chinese chicken salad and it was very bad.....I've gotten this before and it was really good..... But today it wasn't... I was pretty disappointed.....probably won't be going back...."
Joe S.,"Temecula, CA",54,154,94,4.0,7/6/2012,"Okay.  Everybody knows this it the s**t!  The food is awesome and the portions are big enough to take to work for lunch the next day. What I want to know is....... when are you opening one in Temecula?????  If we get the craving for the red velvet cheesecake or the ahi appetizers, we need to either make a road trip to San Diego or Riverside.  Come on guys, Temecula would be a perfect spot."
Lav L.,"Riverside, CA",1,134,113,4.0,3/15/2015,"went for Brunch 2day; they open at 10am on Sundays.  tried the crab hash benedict with breakfast potatoes.  hubby had farmhouse omelet and sister had French toast.  everything was yummy good.  yes, they are very pricey, so come prepared with credit card. lol  sister tried their peach bellini drink, mmmmm good.  also had mimosa.  of course couldn't leave without cheesecake for dessert (to go tho).  looking at their menu will prob come back to try other dishes on their menu.  our waitress was good but not real attentive (I think she was also bartender).  I had to continually put my EMPTY coffee mug on the outside of table in order for her to refill.  but, all and all ($85 dollars + $15 tip later) it was a good day filled with yummy food."
Leon L.,"Riverside, CA",0,4,,3.0,4/7/2015,"I got the rib-eye steak medium rare that came with fries and onion rings. While it wasn't very presentable, the steak was really really good! Better than most places I've eaten steak at. On the downside the fries were room temperature/cold, but the onion rings were pretty good. I would come back just for the steak assuming they make it the same way."
Manny R.,"Lake Elsinore, CA",1,5,,2.0,3/29/2015,Just left here. I have to say food was pretty darn good. But that's where it ends. Waited forever to get apps and food. The waiter was inattentive . Not horrible experience but not great.
Sally M.,"Astoria, OR",108,476,111,4.0,7/19/2010,"I've had mediocre experiences with other Cheesecake Factory locations, so I was surprised that I really enjoyed my meal here.   One of the best things about CF is their gigantic menu- it is like a phone book compared to most menus.  So this would be a good spot if 1.) you don't quite know what kind of food you want (American, Mexican, Asian, etc.) and 2.)  you're in a group and people want to eat different types of cuisine.  I choose two items of their ""small plates and snacks"" menu:  fried zucchini and chicken samosas.  Both were nicely presented with generous portions and very flavorful.  Honestly, it was the best zucchini and samosa I've ever had (especially that cilantro dipping sauce!).  If you're not that hungry, I would definitely recommend just getting one small plate.   I love/hate that they now provide you with full nutritional values of their food.  You don't even have to ask, the server just plops down a separate menu listing all the numbers.  I know it's great for people watching their weight or with special dietary concerns, but I don't like knowing that my lunch is 1,000+ calories."
Eric H.,"San Jose, CA",55,47,5,2.0,5/30/2012,"I got a craving after reminiscing about the Cheesecake Factory's sister restaurant Grand Lux Cafe in Vegas.  Decided to order take out.  Was in the DGAF about health mode that one usually gets when they decide to eat at an establishment like this, so I ordered the macaroni and cheese burger with extra chipotle mayo.   I arrived 20 minutes later and my food was still not ready (I was told 15 minutes).  I'm not mad about this, as I really had nowhere else I needed to be, but the fact that I had to wait in my car instead of at home was a bit annoying.  The bimbo finally comes out with my food (I'm not being mean, she was a freakin airhead), I pay, and drive home.  The fries were way too salty, even for my standards, and instead of giving me extra chipotle mayo, they gave me NONE!  Next time, I'll stick to Grand Lux Cafe in Vegas, not its retarded step sister."
Neil A.,"Corona, CA",42,116,126,4.0,7/28/2010,"I usually don't review big chains, but I wanted to express how much I like the Spicy Ahi Tempura Roll. It's really really good. The crunch of the tempura outside and the cold smooth ahi in the middle is a perfect blend. That and Kirin and I'm set. =] It's found in the appetizer section (hard to find since their menu is big). Here are some other dishes I recommend if you want a bigger meal: Bang - Bang Chicken and Shrimp, Crispy Spicy and Beef, and Miso Salmon"
Jasmin E.,"San Diego, CA",27,52,10,5.0,8/14/2012,"****Only about the bakery/curbside*** Heather in the bakery/curbside was so helpful and sweet when she took and brought out my order. Her customer service was superb! At another visit, I took my grandparents for their anniversary and asked her to write happy anniversary on the plate with their cheesecake. She was really creative and made it so much more fun than just a regular cheesecake."
Monique B.,"Norco, CA",830,40,34,1.0,9/28/2013,"If I could give this place minus stars that still would not be justice to the horrible service we received tonight!   Let me start by saying that although my husband and I are not big fans of the food we decided that maybe it was what we ordered the last two times we ate here and we were actually excited to give it another go, considering how some people rant and rave about it.  The reason for our visit this evening was celebrating my best friend, pregnant sister birthday.  Otherwise we would not of gone out of our way to eat here.  However we arrived and given the amount of our party of 10 and it being a Friday night we greeted the bday girl and most of the party outside.  My husband and I decided to go to the bar and have a drink.  Of course not without asking the birthday girl if we could get her something, water, soda or tea? She asked for a sprite and my husband and I went inside and sat at the bar.  A young lady by the same of Summer was the main bartender serving.  We placed our drink order an asked if we could take the soda outside.  She replied yes but meant the outside of the bar which is the inside waiting area.  We sat there and had a few drinks when some of our other party arrived and joined us at the bar.  We ordered their drinks and then thought, ""instead of letting the sprite sit at the bar and melt"" we asked the bartender for a plastic cup.  She rudely placed the empty plastic cup in front of my husband.  Being a bit disappointed that she placed it there and walked away rudely he asked if she could pour the sprite for him?   She turned and said she will get to it when she can!  She then went back to making drinks and being that it is a busy night she was just short and cold.  Once she did come to pour the soda she slammed the glass the soda was in on the bar and walked away rudely again! My husband then asked if she was always this rude and what the big deal was to smile as she's working.  She then fired back and stated ""she is just too busy and doesn't think asking her to pour the soda was necessary ! At that point I was like wow this lady has problems! I am a very passive person and my husband may have been out of line by asking her about being rude but she was! She then proceeded to carry on an arguement  in order to validate her reason for being upset and it all came back to her being way tooooooo busy.  Really, did she only expect to have two people walk into a Cheesecake Factory, on a Friday night, in a mall shopping center?!?!?  Her serving the bar and possibly the entire restaurant I expect some rush or shortness but to stand there and full on argue with a customer is so appalling!  I then told her I understand your busy but you should still be polite and the reason I say this cuz I have bartender before! She then yelled back"" ya ya ya, I have been doing this for 6 yrs!  At this point I can see she was pointless to talk to so I asked that I speak to the manager. He came over was polite , apologized on her behalf and we told him we are not looking to get anything free but that he simply needed to have a talk to her.  I went through what just happened with her and that we were here with a huge party celebrating a birthday.  He did end up comping our drinks. However the bartender then decided to crack jokes in front of us with the people sitting next to us, so my husband asked if he could have another beer ""if she wasn't to busy"" she then got. upset and said we need to drop it already!  I was like really because you were just cracking sarcastic remarks towards us with the people next to us.  She then started to raise her voice again in front of the manager this time.   The manager again apologized and said she has been going through some personal issues.  I highly recommend they get her help or some time off because that is not how you treat hardworking locals that are going to spend our hardworking money!  We then got our table called thanks to the manager wanting to make the situation better.   However from that point on it was just awkward! Had it not been due to the busy Friday night wait and the birthday girl wanting to eat there we would have easily walked out at this point. However we didn't and we stayed.  We waited 20 mins before we had to ask the servers if we would be getting any bread baskets?  They then took about another 10mins to bring it out.  Our drinks took forever.  The waitress went around the table and took orders and as she went to the person on my left I told her me and my husband were on one bill and she stated she would note that and will take the order the way she is, due to knowing who ordered what. When we asked for the checks she made it a point to call me out and let it be known that I'm the young lady that is with my husband.  She still screwed up the bill twice! Seriously this was a disaster night and feel we were on a black list for the time we spent there.  More rude things happened but not worth mentioning. Although the food was good never again!"
Chacon L.,"Riverside, CA",4,256,7,4.0,5/28/2014,"Food is decent.  Service is great considering the servers have to remember that huge menu. I bet if the menu was limited, quality would be great. Very limited draft beer- I'm a draft kinda guy. Place is almost spotless."
