William M.,"Arcadia, CA",37,23,2,1.0,3/4/2014,"The hostess was great but the two waiters that was waiting my table totally ignored me numerous times. We were a party of 11 and hard to miss, but they still had terrible service this night. They were just throwing our napkin on the table and were frowning the whole time. I will probably not being eating at this cheesecake again since the yelp-era dont know what a good cheesecakw factory service should be."
Ana C.,"Riverside, CA",0,3,,4.0,2/20/2015,"My first time here and i enjoyed it. Large menu but our waitress was very approachable and was able to answer all of our ""newbie"" questions. I loved my shepards pie and fresh strawberry cheesecake. I also had a pina colada to finish my evening."
Belinda L.,"Aurora, CO",34,156,24,4.0,5/17/2012,It's a chain. My favorite chain. So it's not like I can get crazy creative with the review.  So lets keep this one simple.  Fast friendly service. Great cocktails.
Allison P.,"Newport Beach, CA",164,221,59,5.0,10/28/2011,"Always delicious! My mom and I met my grandma here for lunch last weekend. My grandma and I have been to the Cheesecake Factory in Newport Beach and always receive great service and amazing food. This was in fact my mom's first time to a Cheesecake Factory Restaurant. Our server was attentive and provided great service. My grandma had a cup of the soup du jour (Cream of Chicken) and the Quesadilla with Chicken appetizer. My mom ordered the Grilled Turkey Burger off the SkinnyLicious menu. She was raving about the Corn Succotash (Fresh corn, zucchini and bell peppers sauteed in butter). I ordered the Fish and Chips. They were sooooo good, fresh fish and plenty of fries. The only thing that disappointed me, was the fact that we were all to full to eat dessert. Another reason to come back!"
John P.,"Riverside, CA",27,10,1,3.0,7/15/2014,"3 stars at best...menu said ""toasted bun.....""..it was cold as ice...like just out of the refrig! Of course the avocado was cold...I was so ready for a hot toasted bun turkey avocado sandwich, but got a very cold disappointing sandwich that I should have sent back! But I don't trust what chefs can do if U piss them off by sending something back! So I ate it and told my good server that he needed to tell the manager to tell the kitchen...he said he'd tell the kitchen. ..guess he doesn't get it, but a nice guy. Since I don't trust chefs by sending food back, and ate it, i didn't expect them to pick up my tab...but the server Nicholas ""Nic"" should have ask the manager to come over! One of the best salads, but so offset by the cold sandwich! :("
Zombie9511 ..,"Riverside, CA",0,5,,1.0,9/19/2014,Food way over priced . Service sucked very slow. food had no taste never go here again waist pf money
Anthony B.,"Riverside, CA",513,690,483,4.0,3/17/2010,"This is one of those places that will always be near and dear to me and my wife. We first stumbled across Cheesecake Factory (in Denver, Colorado) around 10 years ago. Since then we've continued to dine here. Obviously, as the name implies, the main draw here is the Cheesecake. Being honest, I have never liked Cheesecake but my wife finally got me to try and guess what? I ended up liking it! I still don't like cheesecake to this day with the exception of whatever I order from here (which is usually the Oreo, the Snickers, or the Peanutbutter cheesecake). The food itself is pretty good too. There is a excellent selection to choose from. The most recent dinner item my wife and I have fallen in love with is the Steak & Salmon Diane. Definitely a tasty order. Regardless of if you love cheesecake or just want to try some unqiue and interesting foods, there should be something for just about anyone here."
Cynthia A.,"Long Beach, CA",417,535,108,3.0,11/29/2011,"I really like Cheesecake Factory but I am not a fan of this location. My friend and I got seated outside, which wouldn't have been a problem except for the fact that it was night time and there was no light, not even a candle. I was trying to read my menu with the light from the moon. Finally, I gave up and grabbed my phone and downloaded a flashlight app. A waiter didn't greet us until 10-13 minutes after we were seated and I saw him once more throughout the night and that was about it. Poor service. The food was okay. I ordered the Asian chicken salad and the Asian tacos. The salad had a tower of styrofoam. I like crunchies but geez, can I get some salad too? The Asian tacos tasted good but they were a hassle to eat. They were lettuce wrapped and hard to pick up. Dessert was my favorite part. I had the Pineapple Upside-down cheesecake and it was delicious.  Next time, I will stick to my favorite, the Chicken Madeira...never disappoints! Hopefully the service will be better."
Zen Z.,"Corona, CA",1,24,7,5.0,1/21/2015,"I give this place 5 stars! The food was amazing! we started off with the fried Cuban rolls;  I've never had anything like it in my life and it is now a favorite dish that I will be craving all the time and bugging my fiancé to take me back for! I got the factory combo of steak Diane done medium it was so juicy and tender the red wine sauce on it was amazing as well as the mushrooms! It came with delicious mashed potatoes (although they were cold still very good) and a chicken mileas or something like that which was also good, a little dry but the melted cheese on top and asparagus  made up for it. We also got a side of meatballs which was so not worth it for $7.95 u get 3 meatballs in a cold marinara sauce bad idea. And the cheesecake is no joke! So dense and rich I loved the Kahlua Cocoa coffee. We also brought home a whole Reese's cheesecake which I have yet to try. Not to mention the staff was also amazing."
Christie S.,"San Diego, CA",1,19,8,5.0,6/2/2015,"Came in here for some happy hour on a Tuesday and left full and happy. I ordered the dumplings and the tex mex egg rolls, and my goodness they did not disappoint. Awesome portion sizing especially since they were on the hh menu. The server was friendly and did a great job. Overall a great experience."
Andy H.,"Vista, CA",302,431,93,2.0,6/16/2011,"I'm really tempted to give this place a 1 star... the service i got here was outright horrible. It took her forever to ask for drinks, to take our order, to get our food out and get the check. i mean it was just horrible all around. This one is remarkably different than the one in San Diego. The one in San Diego would rush to help you at any cost. They also seem to care more about their customers than this location. Our food (both ordered the spaghetti with Chicken and roasted garlic) showed up cold and disappointing in taste. It was even hard to locate a manager to voice my complaint about the horrible service I was receiving. Oh and did i mention this place was practically slow when we went on a Sunday evening...  Needless to say, I will not be returning to this location. I still love cheesecake factory, just not this one."
Autumn R.,"Riverside, CA",5,4,,1.0,10/28/2014,I used to love this place until on national cheesecake day there was a cockroach on top of our cheesecake. the manager acted like nothing and just offered to take it off our receipt. :( I will never go here again!!
J R.,"Riverside, CA",0,2,,1.0,1/6/2015,food took 40 minutes to arrive and was cold.  waited another 10 minutes for re heat and manager.  neither showed so we left the cold nachos (untouched)  and my kids half eaten pizza.  never again.
Virginia C.,"Riverside, CA",9,7,,2.0,9/8/2013,Food was incredible !!!! However the staff all appeared to hate there jobs. Worst bar tender in the world. Some Asian guy with NO personality. He walk away from my friend as he was talking to him. Rude! Waiter attentive with no personality . It was dead in there! Even the hottest was in slow motion!
Natalie S.,"Riverside, CA",86,277,1560,4.0,3/14/2012,"Oh man so many options!!! My favorite are the gourmet burgers I always sub for the Kobe beef patty on the Americana burger medium rare temperature always perfect. Never really been disappointed with any food items, even the starter bread is delicious. Their cocktails are delicious too, a little pricier but still really good. The restaurant for being a chain is so beautiful inside, always very clean and service is good. Lots of menu options so prepare to spend quite a bit of time looking lol. Cheesecakes are delicious and their whipped cream is addictive. The only downside is I don't know when to stop...from the drinks, bread, appetizer, main course and dessert I make myself sick, what? I'm not wasteful hehe."
Tiffany M.,"Paramount, CA",3,15,10,4.0,2/22/2014,"Yummy food, okay service. For it to be a Saturday afternoon, my table of 3 got sat in less than 15 minutes."
Joel O.,"Riverside, CA",2,117,2,4.0,3/17/2012,"We had dinner here to celebrate a birthday.  The food was quite good (huge selection BTW) and service was too for the most part.  We ended up having two servers share our table.  The first appeared to be a little overwhelmed with the evening.  It was a very busy Friday night.  The second, Jairo, (I think) was outstanding.  He kept our glasses full and made sure empty plates were immediately removed from the table. The bread was a great appetizer and the food arrived fairly quickly.  Everyone was please with their meal and many had to take home leftovers as the portions were generous.  The prices were reasonable for dinner at about $25 per person with drink, tax, and tip included. As with any large chain restaurant, we had a dirty water glass and a dirty spoon at one place setting.  No big deal, but worthy of comment.  The noise level was fine and we were able to enjoy conversation at the table with everyone present.   Oh, one thing.  The tiny little double-shot-glass sized birthday sundae they serve when you have someone with a birthday is not complimentary. It will cost you an additional $2.95 plus tax, so be prepared to see that on the bill.  The servers were great and happily sang Happy Birthday for the guest of honor.   I was surprised to find there is no wi-fi at this location.  Management, if you read this, I would suggest adding complimentary wi-fi as nearly everyone has a smartphone these days and it is nice to have free internet access, especially while waiting to be seated. All in all, a very pleasant experience."
James G.,"Riverside, CA",0,4,,5.0,7/19/2011,"Great food consistently with pretty good service. Seems whatever I order I am either pleased or really impressed...although I guess I am a picky eater so my choices are limited lol. Anyways, Great place, great food and really good management there as well."
Danielle D.,"Irvine, CA",119,329,146,3.0,2/2/2014,Pretty good standard food. Always a wait for some reason. Really loud. Food always comes out on the richer/fatty side. Leaves u feeling like u have a film in your mouth. Gross sorry. It's true tho. Our server was ok as was the establishment. I am likely to return come lack of options.
Trissia W.,"Westminster, CA",130,421,14,2.0,3/6/2011,"this review is not for the food, which thankfully was excellent as usual. But for the crappy service. I've only been to 4 or 5 different Cheesecake's but one think I expect is great service. First complaint, terrible seating plan- they buzzed up 4 groups and then made us wait another 10 minutes to really get seated. We were right in the path of all the servers,manager types and fellow eaters. I don't get that at all and wish they'd just call you up when they have a host to take you back. This was frustrating because the girl who sat us was visiby annoyed when the party behind us had the same name. She was rude and acted like it. Next to our server, Brent or Brett. The only good thing I can say is he took a break and another lady helped us for the serving and follow up. Although, he came back for dessert. The cheesecake I had ordered had a brownie layer on the bottom which bent the fork I was using. He came by to check 10 minutes later and when I told him, he actually grabbed the fork out of my hand and tried the cheesecake and said ""I dont see a problem"".  So Riverside you have a lot to learn. I hate to say it but I don't think the people in this area care about crappy service cuz the line was out the door at 930pm on a Sat night. I didn't give you 1 star cuz we did love the food. So I'll stay away from this CF."
