Liz T.,"Los Angeles, CA",184,567,194,5.0,12/17/2011,"Great service, Mike is awesome!  everyone is so friendly, food is fantastic.  I usually get the normal jambalaya pasta, ahi cap. appetizer, burgers, etc.  But last night I tried to blackened shrimp and it was so good!!  I've got to say I haven't really had any of the items that are horrible, for the huge selection that they have it's so amazing that there's so much yumminess on so many pages, decisions decisions.  And of course the cheesecake is the best ever!!"
Lackis S.,"Riverside, CA",74,170,26,4.0,5/6/2011,"The Cheesecake Factory is good for what you see in the title; Cheesecake. The food is decent, but completely overrated. The Cheesecake on the other hand is excellent. They have a ton of choices to choose from and all of the flavors I've tired are awesome! Good restaurant and great service. I never had an issue here :)"
Logan D.,"Temecula, CA",26,11,,5.0,6/14/2015,"I ate at cheesecake earlier tonight (it's 11pm) and I just wanted to make sure I didn't forget to write this review. Why? Well the host team wasn't too friendly. And our server was good, but I could tell she was swamped with tables(not her fault) but the blonde man who brought us all of our food, Shane, was fantastic! I wish he was a server and I could sit in his section he was so welcoming. He truly made our night and took great care of my family and myself. His attitude is the kind that makes regulars."
Enua C.,"San Diego, CA",48,36,38,1.0,8/25/2013,"Horrible service. I took my girlfriend here for her birthday and just got the worst service ever, they didn't even sing ""happy birthday"" to her. The food was horrible too, they forgot about us for 40 minutes and then decided to cook our meals in less than 2 minutes. Not to mention that I was asked if I wanted  a box to go right after I took my first bite."
Eileen C.,"Claremont, CA",426,313,12,4.0,1/27/2011,"It's a Cheesecake Factory. It's mildly delicious for a chain, and the multitude of uninspired, generic dishes ensure every diner finds an appetizing choice. So I ordered the Farm Burger and was told rare is ""pretty much  red"", to which I replied ""Sweet, bring it!"". It was well done. But I ate it happily due to the fact that this particular location happens to allow small pets in their patio seating. Ever since I became the proud owner of a humping Morkie puppy, priorities regarding dining establishments have completely shifted. What can I say, I love the little pervert enough to tolerate bad burgers."
Alyssa W.,"Highland, CA",18,22,1,1.0,10/18/2014,"Our experience here was such a disappointment. We expected good clean food here but end up finding hair in our food. How do we know its not our hair in the food? We both have black hair and the hair that was in our food is BLOND! We called the waitress over and told they have hair in their food and they basically took it back and gave us a ""new one"" i wasn't sure if its new or not so i asked just in case but still felt cheated. I have sent former reports to food inspectors before on visits to restaurants...although i don't feel the issue of hair would prompt me to go that far...but it was still on my mind. Anyways, im very upset about my visit here and to add to the blow...nothing was compt or suggested. What is wrong with restaurants these days...i guess they really don't want my or my friends, and my friends friends, and everyone i will tell and they will tell their friends not to come here again."
Caitlin Y.,"Long Beach, CA",63,90,165,4.0,11/25/2011,"I love Cheesecake Factory! One of my favorite restaurants ever. Food is good and the portions are always really big. Fresh bread when you get to your table. I love their strawberry lemonades! I always ask for a to-go cup! The service is alright. Sometimes slacks a little, but overall decent. Had one waiter even be so honest that he talked me out of their peanut sauce pasta because he said it's only good for a couple bites before you get tired of it. Still would go back, food is always good and filling... I also love their cheesecake, their original and key lime are my favorite! Both satisfying, but still light and clean tasting. My favorite dish by far is the Renee's Special! Sandwich, soup, and salad for about $10! YUM!"
Humberto G.,"Vista, CA",288,496,720,4.0,2/23/2011,"I love Cheesecake Factory.  I don't care that it is a chain restaurant, or that it takes an hour to get in here sometimes.  Came in a few weeks ago for lunch on a Saturday though, and surprisingly the line that I was expecting was nonexistent.  Sweet. When I came here last month, I had the Santa Fe Salad for lunch.  I usually get the Chicken Madeira, but considering that we were going to have a big dinner later I opted for this plate.  That, and I knew my sister wasn't going to finish her fettuccine alfredo.  I was right, as we both loaded up on bread and we both didn't finish our meals.  I also love their tropical iced tea, and service was great as usual.   I don't think I have had one bad experience at any of the 4 different CF I have been at.  I love this place, and I will continue to come here as long as my bank account will allow.  Good thing for me though, is that the closest one to me is still 31.2 miles away per Google Maps."
J.R. W.,"Riverside, CA",0,35,,4.0,9/17/2011,"Buffalo Chicken Blasts Appetizer is AWESOME AMAZING OUTSTANDING! The Fried Mac & Cheese balls are the same. I like the pulled pork sandwich, and while not super amazing, the fries are tasty and usually cooked the way I like them, crispy on the outside, soft and fluffy inside. I notice a lot of people complain how this place is overpriced, but you get a ton of food. I pay $12 for a sandwich & fries which I get 2 meals out of. While it's not cheap, you get enough food to warrant the prices. Also the Reeces something or other Cheesecake is crazy delicious. The only thing I don't like about this place is the wait can sometimes be like WTF long (an hour or more) But on the flip side, I've never had a sub par meal here.  Luckily for me, I'm not 1 of those foodie snob who'll only eat at super exclusive spots nobody knows about. So I can eat at a big chain like here and still enjoy it. They also get points for having an absolutely ginormous menu.  And to all the idiots complaining about the calorie and fat content. If you don't eat the entire damn meal in 1 sitting you'll be fine. And if you're able to finish an entire entree here, you're a pig and are being a damn hypocrite complaining about calories and sh*t. News Flash: a 1/2lb burger LOADED with bacon and cheese that has aa big ass side order of fries is going to have a ton of calories (surprise, surprise!)"
Jessica D.,"Riverside, CA",106,49,37,3.0,11/3/2013,"(Sorry for such a long review!) My family usually doesn't go to the Cheesecake Factory just because the prices are so expensive for mediocre food, however, we decided to go there tonight since it's close and sounded appetizing at the time.  We got there around 9:30..didn't wait too long for our seats, and our waiter, Nick, came by immediately to greet and serve us. Nick was a great waiter..he was funny, friendly, and was constantly attending to our needs. So the service at the restaurant, for the most part, was great.  We then ordered our food. All four of us got chicken dishes, mine specifically was the tomato basil pasta. It took about 20 minutes for all of our food to arrive, which I thought was a pretty long time, however, I didn't let it bother me. So the food gets to our table, and looks great. I dig right in, and find something peculiar about my pasta. It was kind of tough. I didn't want to be wrong, so I got a second, third, and fourth opinion from my two brothers and my best friend. I let the waiter know, and he willingly sent it back and gave me a complimentary salad as I waited (which I did not enjoy that much, but it was the thought that counted). Another fifteen minutes go by and I still have no food. By this time everyone at the table is done eating, so I ask for my food to go..which didn't arrive for another ten minutes. The waiter kindly told me that if the food is still not good when I got home, to call the restaurant and let them know the issue for a free gift card to the restaurant. I said thank you, but didn't think that I would need to complain anymore.  So we get home, and even though I'm not hungry at this point, I taste my food to make sure that it was cooked properly. Sadly, it wasn't. The pasta was still very dry and tough. I call back the restaurant, and get put on the phone with the manager. I let him know the situation, and he tries to explain to me how pasta is supposed to be cooked, and that's how it's done in Italy. That kind of ticked me off, because he made me seem like I don't know how pasta is supposed to be cooked. I, as well as my brothers, know quite well what 'al dente' is because it's not the first time we had pasta. 'Al dente,' yes, is not supposed to be soft and break apart, but that doesn't mean it should be rubbery and have crunchy parts in it. Now, I'm not one to make up complaints just for free things, but I'm assuming that's what he thought I was after. Anyway, he ended up sending me a fre gift card to repay for my meal, which was very curteous.  Overall, I was satisfied with the service of the Cheesecake Factory staff, but I don't think I will go there again if it's not for dessert. There are so many other authentic restaurants that serve much better food for a much cheaper price."
Meg S.,"Corona, CA",1,11,5,1.0,8/6/2015,"I'm seriously appalled at the way staff and especially the manager handled my family's recent visit to your Riverside, California location. Sunday 08/02/15 at around 5pm my family and I went in for dinner. I have a severe allergy to shellfish and made sure that when we were seated I informed our server of my allergy. He asked, ""well is anybody ordering shellfish?"" I replied no and he responded, ""well then you should be fine."" We got our food and after two bites I began to itch all over my chest and it became difficult to breathe. My husband could tell something was wrong and immediate notified our server I was having a reaction and he said he would get his manager. I began coughing to the point  where I started to gag and my husband grabbed my Epi-pen and had to stab me in the leg at the table all occurring in front of the restaurant manager and my children. The manager chuckled and made a joking comment about how he had an allergy and he would just go remake my food. I normally get immediate relief after administering the Epi-pen, but not this time. I continued coughing to the point of throwing up. My husband tried dialing 911 but had no cell signal. When he asked the employee if there was a medic or EMT on the mall grounds because my Epi-pen was not giving me any relief and I needed to get to a hospital the employee responded with, ""No we don't. But let me get you your bill so you can hurry up and get her there."" There was never an offer to call 911 and the manager never returned to our table to even check on us!!! My children were in absolute hysterics and panicking because of what they were witnessing. My husband paid the bill and got me immediately to a hospital where I was treated for anaphylactic shock. My blood pressure and oxygen were extremely low and the hospital couldn't believe that an ambulance wasn't called! The doctor said that there had to have been cross contamination and improper food handling for me to have had a reaction this severe. As if that weren't bad enough my husbands friend who was also dining with us called the location and spoke to the manager who acted like the situation was no big deal but said he would refund the charge, that was never done! So thank you Cheesecake Factory for not following proper food handling procedures, poor management, making a mockery of severe food allergies that have the potential to be life threatening and putting people's lives at risk!"
Gina G.,"Ontario, CA",31,68,,4.0,2/17/2015,love the portions here. the food is good and so many choice s .cheesecake to take home for a late nite treat .
Lili R.,"Riverside, CA",0,32,5,4.0,1/20/2014,"I always have a pleasant experience here, nothing to complain about, the seating is pretty fast too, I do recommend going here."
Kami K.,"Riverside County, CA",18,39,17,2.0,3/5/2013,"I came here tonight with my BFF for dinner. We both order two appetizers each, as our meal. My BFF ordered the grilled artichoke. Unfortunately, it came with a surprise...a worm! My BFF was horrified b/c she hates bugs. The manager was nice enough to remove the artichoke from our bill & offered us a piece of cheesecake, on the house. We ordered the mango key lime one to go. She'd lost her appetite. Once home we began to eat the cheese cake only to discover a hair in it! See pictures. :("
Henry L.,"Long Beach, CA",3,205,,4.0,8/30/2013,"came in here during happy hour and spent sat at the bar area.  ordered from  the happy hour menu.  The house wine which i hardly ever drink at restaurants was actually very good.  Ended ordering that much of the night before switching to whiskey.  Prices for wine during happy hour are $5 for wine, $5 appetizers from the selected menu.  pretty simple and straight forward.  Thats a given for 3 stars.  But what made it the 4th star was the service.  The bar tender was great.  She kept coming over and asking if we need anything.  To a point that i was surprised she was coming so much.  But looking back at it, it was one of the best service i've had in a long time.  Didnt order any food besides appetizers.  The whiskey prices is a little trickey.  $7 for one shot, or $12 for 2 shots.  so if you're going to drink more than one shot go ahead and save a couple of bucks."
Kevin K.,"Alhambra, CA",396,100,4,4.0,3/11/2011,"Cheesecake has always been one of the better chain restaurants. The food is good and the service is usually great. Every single time I went they have attended to my every needs promptly.  Get the stuffed mushrooms! I can't get enough of it here. It's so delicious! It's under small bites or small appetizers. It's around $4 and the portion is small, but it's just too good to pass up. I usually get a shrimp pasta if I'm really hungry, or the chopped Salisbury Steak if I want something decent sized, delicious, and not too expensive. Couple it up with the Mango or Strawberry slush/iced drink(?) and you'll be good. And don't forget to get a CHEESECAKE! (duh!)"
I G.,"Irvine, CA",33,131,36,4.0,10/26/2013,"Came here on a Tuesday night. Not many people here but they are opened late. The food takes a while to come, and the quality is just the standard Cheesecake Factory chain quality. We had a very good server help us. He was nice, attentive, and respectful. I def would return for any more outings with friends the only thing holding me back is that it is not connected to the mall...NOT a big deal, but a little inconvenient."
Laura B.,"Lake Elsinore, CA",77,4,3,4.0,1/3/2014,"Love the salmon, but the mashed potato taste different. They are not as creamy as they use to be."
Veronica S.,"Los Angeles, CA",47,233,402,5.0,7/25/2013,"The food is delicious and the service is good. The waitress brought my 15 month old some chopped banana and some juice at no extra charge.  The staff  is friendly and the food is great. Try the meatloaf, you wont regret it. Or the Factory Burger, it is so good and filling."
Mr D.,"Riverside, CA",1,29,,2.0,8/1/2014,"We've always enjoyed the variety and quality of menu choices. Yet, there is one constant issue we've had over the last couple years: take-out is not their strength. I've lost count of the number of times we've brought food home and something is missing. The managers are always responsive and make adjustments to our tab, but that really isn't the point. Last night it was something simple like the aioli was not included with the artichoke. Not a big deal, but I had just spent enough for two dinners at another restaurant and the side, which is the differentiator, was not included."
