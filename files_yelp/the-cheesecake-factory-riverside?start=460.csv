Cori S.,"Riverside, CA",0,5,,4.0,2/27/2015,Love everything in the menu.  Love the amounts you get enough to take home. Friendly  and waiting time not so bad.
Carolyn H.,"Riverside, CA",1,18,1,5.0,11/28/2013,"The cheesecake is simply amazing I had the Vanilla Bean and it was not to sweet and perfect texture ~ The service is very good too , everyone has a smile on their face & they are all dressed very neat & nice!"
Shauna K.,"Corona, CA",0,1,,4.0,2/25/2015,"The food is excellent here. I ordered the angel hair with shrimp and it was very good. Although the shrimp in it tasted a little off and there wasn't enough sauce put in to it. Other than the food, the service was outstanding. It was very busy but they still managed to get everything in time."
Sean B.,"Irvine, CA",7,114,2,4.0,7/28/2013,"Nice decor, decent food and great service not rushed , I would recommend them for a nice time out."
Christi S.,"Riverside, CA",46,27,4,4.0,7/11/2013,"Love lunch menu. Try the Ranee's special. Chicken salad sandwich, large mixed green salad and soup of the day. Service is consistently good and management seems to care about customers."
J W.,"Norman, OK",0,11,,2.0,12/9/2013,"Slow food in a chain restaurant. At least there were  leftovers, and lots."
K V.,"Temecula, CA",2,7,,3.0,10/24/2013,"This wasn't my first visit to the Cheesecake Factory. I've been to many before but this was the first time i've come to this one. Our server was very over the top and was too busy talking to realize that I hadn't touched my food. I've been a server before so I decided not to complain and see if she would notice. She brought our bill I explained that I didn't like my food and that I wasn't ready for our bill. Overall, this place has okay food and okay service. Nothing to go home and tell your family about."
Aida D.,"Los Angeles, CA",115,173,8,3.0,5/25/2010,"This review is strictly for the Original Cheesecake that I ordered to go... . I enter and walk to the bakery side & look at the cakes & their prices... ""Dam, I wish there was a Porto's around here- I could of gotten a WAY bigger cake for this price"".. But whatever- for $15.65 +tax, I got a 6inch :mini"" Cheesecake. The cashier informed me that the cake was frozen & would take at least an hour to thaw.. I should of asked her for how long the cake had been frozen? hours? days? Mmm- I became skeptical about purchasing this cake after I heard her say this.. But it was my cousin's bday & i did not want to show up empty handed.... A few hours later we dig into the cheesecake- & surprisingly,it was pretty good. The frosting was kinda too cream cheesy for me but overall it was yummy. Would I buy it again- not really. I'm sure for that price I can get something better & biGGER..."
Tovah G.,"Hawthorne, CA",71,60,10,5.0,3/24/2013,Went here for a quick lunch with a close friend and while this was my second visit to this location I was incredibly impressed this time. I had a turkey avocado sandwich and it was amazing. The service was prompt and our server was so friendly. Definitely going back.
Eddie D.,"Hemet, CA",43,54,43,1.0,12/19/2012,"Food was mediocre, service was hardly existent. Long wait for food. Will not be visiting here again."
Amanda S.,"Corona, CA",23,54,35,5.0,3/17/2013,I love that this place has so many options on their menu but I always get the chipotle pasta and tarimisu cheesecake. Every time! It's delicious
Valeria C.,"Riverside, CA",0,5,,5.0,1/1/2015,"most def worth my money! super delicious food, drinks, bread and of course, best of all, their CHEESECAKE!!"
Jamie A.,"San Diego, CA",48,204,65,4.0,12/3/2010,"While in Riverside for a business trip, five of us stopped by the Cheesecake Factory for dinner.  There was no wait and we were seated right away.  The staff was very friendly and the food was all tasty.   Most of the party got a combo of steak and scampi.  I got the salmon/scampi combo.  The salmon was not to flavorful but OK.  Most everyone thought the breading on the scampi was not good and unusual to have on the scampi.  I would still order the scampi and try the steak the next time. A few people did get cheesecake to go.  We had a good meal at the Cheesecake Factory while on our trip!"
J F.,"Corona, CA",0,35,27,5.0,8/2/2013,This place has always had great service. Waiters and waitresses are on it. Food is really good.
KW L.,"Corona, CA",93,3,2,4.0,4/15/2014,"I come here at least once a month. The service is good. My favorite dishes are their chicken tenders and gumbo. Their peach smoothy is very good it is made of real fruit. Also, their cheesecake is excellent I love the tiramisu cheesecake. It is a great place to hang out with friends and enjoy a great meal."
YouGoGlenCoco S.,"Los Angeles, CA",89,98,108,1.0,5/22/2012,"Don't get me wrong, I LOVE Cheesecake Factory. But this location is just horrible. We got seated at a table in a tiny little nook with a rocking table!!! Omg, I was so annoyed. The service is shit. The food is not that great compared to my favorite Cheesecake Factory at the Grove. One of the guys working there was moving tables around making all kinds of loud noises and after he was FINALLY done, another worker approached him and he had to move everything back. Oh.em.gee. I came to the restaurant to have a meal peacefully. The noise was so loud, I couldn't even hear myself think. Food took forever and a day to be brought to our table. I will not return to this location."
Dean A.,"Loma Linda, CA",17,6,3,3.0,1/15/2014,"Friendy staff, good food, prices could be a little better in my opinion. Over all it was a good night!"
Minnie D.,"Irvine, CA",0,25,8,5.0,6/21/2013,This location is not as busy so the wait isn't that bad.  The service is excellent!   The food is always delicious :-)
Lisa C.,"Lake Forest, CA",16,31,4,5.0,2/19/2013,"I love the Cheesecake Factory and have been to the Riverside location many times. Always good service and anything you order is good too. I love their appetizers cause they are good portions for when you don't want to eat a lot. The service is always fast, courteous and friendly!"
Uh'oh U.,"Menifee, CA",0,22,3,1.0,2/25/2014,"I came in here on a date with my girlfriend on an afternoon. I had a $25 coupon here so I wanted to spend it. Never been here. So I was a first timer.  Let me start off by saying the staff was a little rude at first. The host was in a snappy stuck up mood. You can tell. Then our waiter took awhile to help us. Though there was only a couple people in her section. Anyways, we ordered the calamari dish (for her) and I ordered the nacho dish. Let me just say that in the description it sounded amazing. 15-20 min later we finally got our food. And it was awful. The calamari was sorta the only thing that was good. Though it was really deep fried. BUT my nachos were a disgrace. If I wanted to order nachos that have been microwaved. I woulda just made them at home. The chips were stale. You can tell that all they did was sprinkle cheese on it and microwaved it. Not to mention it wasn't even warm. They served it cold. WORST thing I have ever gotten. I don't care if I got everything for free (coupon) to serve something microwaved from such a distinguished restaurant chain is a disgrace. I seriously ate like 3-4 chips and I was done. Horrible experience. Never went back since. And never will. Honesty there's so many more good restaurants around Tyler mall. I suggest you go to those before choosing here."
