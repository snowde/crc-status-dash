Victoria B.,"Riverside, CA",0,14,,3.0,3/17/2012,"When this place gets busy the service there is horrible. I asked one of the many hostess how long the wait was, she didn't even look up at me and tell me she said it with a attitude that it was going to be a 45 minute wait. When I came to tell her that my beeper hasent gone off,she gave me a bitchy attitude. The food that day wasn't soo tasty the server came by once in awhile too check on us,she seemed out of it too. I gave it 3 stars because most if the time I go here it good its just that one night I came here was not soo good. I would suggest going when they don't have a dinner rush"
Mimi A.,"Riverside, CA",4,27,,4.0,5/29/2012,Been here a few times n love the food and the service. I got the lousiana pasta with linguine instead of bow-tie (which it originally comes with)..n i got extra sauce on the side! it was delicious but on the warm side...i like my food to be hot!
Shaleyah S.,"Moreno Valley, CA",60,6,59,2.0,1/2/2014,"I've visited this particular location of the Cheesecake Factory on several occasions, and each experience has been pleasant. Good food, prompt service, AMAZING cheesecake...what's not to love? With this in mind, I chose to visit this location once again for my annual birthday lunch with my mother. Just as expected, the service was prompt, and the food was great. Everything was going well...until I approached the dessert bar to order a slice of cheesecake to go.  After I selected my cheesecake & paid the cashier, I watched in horror as the young lady working behind the counter grabbed my dessert with her bare hands & set it inside of a plastic container. Still in shock, I asked the cashier if it was a standard practice for their employees to wear gloves when handling the desserts. He quickly replied, ""No, we wash our hands."" Although I do not doubt that the employees wash their hands frequently, I still found it a bit unsanitary and ultimately canceled my order.  It's never pleasant to see a complete stranger paw your food with bare hands...no matter how clean they may be. Overall, this was very disappointing, as I was looking forward to trying a different flavor of cheesecake. Unfortunately, I doubt that I will ever patronize this location again."
Gmy L.,"Moreno Valley, CA",3,6,1,5.0,6/11/2013,"Love Cheesecake Factory, try the jambalaya...my favorite."
Grette L.,"Riverside, CA",23,37,28,5.0,2/17/2013,"Their menu is extensive, but everything is delicious!!! This particular local is within the mall so its great for after a day of shopping or for family dinners."
Richard L.,"Mira Loma, CA",10,115,3,2.0,9/23/2010,"I went here with colleagues after a work event mid week. First point, they don't take reservations.... even for large groups. It was pretty empty when we showed up, so they were able to set up seating for us (20~ish of us) pretty quickly. They assigned two servers to the table, but it wasn't enough, or the service is just slow. Drinks took forever to arrive after the order. At which point they took meal orders... I saw other tables arrive, have drinks, order dinner, eat dinner, order desert, eat desert and leave in the time it took from us ordering dinner to receiving dinner, and even then it took so long for them to bring out the food to everyone that some people were done with dinner before others had even been served. I ordered the Hibachi steak. This was a Japanese themed meal with bean sprouts, wasabi mashed potatoes and tempura asparagus. The steak was tough and chewy, but the sauce on it tasted great, the wasabi sauce on the potatoes was also good, just a pity the potatoes themselves were hard and gluey. So... order a bowl of sauce?"
Chantille G.,"Riverside, CA",51,78,12,5.0,6/30/2014,"The service I received here was spot on. I've never been let down coming here. Their menu is full of delious entrees. The cheesecake is always a must, even though were too full to eat it there we always take a slice home. We always get lucky and go after the dinner rush and we are instantly greeted and seated. Our drinks are always full and the waiters are always checking on us. Defanitly will be going back. thanks for such great experiences."
Maurice B.,"Lake Elsinore, CA",14,28,,2.0,12/22/2011,"Got at least two stars because the atmosphere was decent. Now lets run through why the first time at CF will be my last. Get there, and of all the open tables we are walk straight to the back right next to the damn kitchen. Then BAM, water comes out, sandfly in my friends drink. Sliders come out, NO cheese and thin cuts of meat on the bread (i could see thru the meat thin) i ask for cheese, bam out come a cold slab of rockhard ""gubment"" cheese to cut and put on my sliders. Along with a disclaimer that this piece of cheese will cost extra. Avocado eggrolls left a bad taste in my mouth. The meals were bland and my ""pasta"" looked and tasted like something i would make and i cant cook. Dont plan on returning to CF. Go around the corner to the Yardhouse or TGIF."
Kelly B.,"Moreno Valley, CA",1,22,,3.0,8/28/2014,"The food was delicious. This was my first time here and I got the Renee's special with the chicken salad sandwich, salad, and baked potato soup. Some of the other people in my party got the same thing and we all agreed, the sandwich was delicious, the soup was absolutely amazing, but the salad had way too much salad dressing. Another person in our party got a burger and it was mediocre, and the onion rings were pretty greasy. The consensus was that a fast food burger and onion rings would have actually been better.  I'm knocking off two stars because of the service. We were trying to decide where to go and called while in the parking lot to see if there was a wait time, or if we could put in a reservation. They told us we couldn't put in a reservation, but that there was no wait time. We told them we were a large party of 10 and they said still, there was no wait time. We walked in the door less than 5 minutes later and were told there would be a 45 minute wait. That was extremely annoying. We were then seated after about 35 minutes and our server, though very friendly, was very slow. Some people got there food (no exaggeration here) 45 minutes before others. It took them an hour just to get the bread on the tables and many of us weren't eating until we had been seated for close to two hours. Normally I would chalk this up to us being a big party, but while that would explain why it takes a while for us to get the food, it doesn't explain why it took so long to take the orders, or even bring us straws. It was clear they weren't incredibly busy, so I'm unsure why everything took so long.  We also asked them to sing happy birthday to one of the girls in our party, and they came almost an hour after we asked, when 3 girls from the party stepped away to the bathroom, which was annoying. Of all the times to come over that hour, they chose that point."
Derek T.,"Pasadena, CA",136,193,38,1.0,11/17/2009,"Never been a fan of Cheese Cake but this place was suggested by my date, so what's a guy to do but to oblige.  I was highly disappointed with the entrée (Seared Tuna Salad).  What I did like was the fried Zucchini.  My date had a chicken sun dried tomato alfredo pasta which was so so.   This place is a no go in my book."
Jim S.,"Burbank, CA",1,73,,3.0,9/25/2014,"We had a decent experience at the Cheesecake Factory.  There is a good selection of food items, including vegetarian options for a couple of people in our group.  The waitress was efficient, although not particularly friendly.  The portions were big, so we ended up taking a lot of food home.  They also sell cheesecake by the slice."
Nate D.,"Riverside, CA",0,65,2,4.0,1/19/2013,Great food but they seem to be inconsistent on service. We will get a run of 4 or 5 good servers then the next time we go we end up with one that stinks. Doesnt seem to be a specific day or time it just happens sometimes.
Vic C.,"Orange, CA",20,24,,3.0,9/26/2010,"I've been to many different TCFs, so I didn't except great food. Surprisingly, I enjoyed the food at this TCF. The downside is that pretty much all TCFs have got to learn how to cook the food right.  If you order a filet mignon MW.. they will either give you W or M. Besides, whether undercook or overcook, they always burn the exterior of the steak, which makes the meat bitter if not ugly (well.. it was at night and the restaurant was dark, so you cannot really see the ugliness *crossed finger*). It also makes the exterior difficult to bite because the burnt part makes the steak chewy and tough outside (not too bad inside this time). However, the side for the filet mignon is not served at the same time.  Besides filet mignon, we also got the steak diana and jamaican black pepper shrimp with chicken. My bud likes the steak diana. I like the chicken and sweet potato in my dish, but the shrimps are overcook, dry, and unfresh. I didn't finish the sides which comes with rice, mango salsa and black beans. The rice and salsa occupied 1/4 of the plate and the black beans occupied 2/4 of the plate.. which gave me a feeling to vomit .. I quickly finished the chicken and have my friend help me with the shrimps, and had the server took the plate away from my sight. We were in a hurry, so I didn't give them a second chance. The servers at this location are great. The manager is great too. I had 3 different servers who served me because I switched from a booth to a table once and the second server was off duty in the middle, so I got a third to serve my table. They are all genuine, nice and helpful, so we tipped them each.  Pretty good dinning experience at this location. By the way, the avocado eggrolls is great, the warp is crispy unlike the TCF near my home and the seasoning is much better."
JPenni L.,"Redlands, CA",9,55,15,5.0,6/25/2012,"Best thing on the menu is the Chicken Madiera (substitute mash potatoes for bow tie pasta) OR the Thai Lettuce Wrap. So good! Cheesecake Factory never disappoints.. Food is always fresh and consistently good, ambience is casual but classy. It caters to everybody. Their menu is like a book and their cheesecake menu will confuse you even more. Try my favorites along with the Tiramisu cheesecake and you'll go home happy."
Crystal S.,"Riverside, CA",1,11,,1.0,9/12/2014,"I usually don't have any problems at this particular Cheesecake Factory. Tonight's another story. I went out with a couple friends and decide to get burgers. So I ordered my favorite chile relleno burger. A few minutes later the waitress returns and says they don't have it anymore. So I tried to pick something else. I settle for the Classic Burger, protein style. After what seemed like forever. And seeing other tables getting their food and not us, they finally bring out our food and everything was correct at our table except for mine which the server said was an Old Fashioned burger NOT protein style. I told him that's not what I ordered and that it's supposed to be protein style. He says oh yeah well let me check that and fix it for you. He proceeds to come back not 2 minutes later with the SAME dry burger sloppily thrown in a couple of lettuce leaves. I said this is still not what I ordered and he ignored me and walked away. I was fed up and hungry at this point so I ate it anyway. All I wanted was the Classic burger since it said it came with grilled onions. By the way the broccoli I ordered on the side was undercooked and watery. Thankfully my two friends didn't have a problem with their orders. Next time I'll go to red robin."
Aaron S.,"Murrieta, CA",457,323,8,3.0,7/11/2012,Casual Dinner. Better than most times I've been! Had the jambalaya and it was pretty average.. But whatever. Stone IPA with it probably made it better than it was.
Lea B.,"Riverside, CA",2,17,,3.0,8/25/2014,"food was fabulous , service was lousy , my server didn't offer us drinks, i'm in  my twenty's and she disregarded any cocktail beverage question I had."
Paul C.,"Riverside, CA",10,28,19,3.0,6/25/2009,"Like most other chains, you pretty much know what you are going to get at almost any Cheesecake Factory location you visit. *Save room for dessert +The Steak Diane is usually a can't miss dish here. +Godiva chocolate brownie sundae is good +There are no surprises here -There are no surprises here -Very Limited choices for vegetarians I've visited this location a few times and the food has always met everyone's expectations. The staff is usually reasonably well mannered/friendly and I've never had a bad time here. Like most chains, it gets pretty busy on Friday & Saturday nights, so plan ahead if you don't want a long wait. There are no real surprises here, and that's both a good and bad thing, depending on what you're looking for. If you're just in the mood to relax and eat some conventional food, this location should meet your expectations. Oh, and while it's a little hackneyed to mention, you can't really go wrong if you try one of their desserts."
A B.,"Perris, CA",5,22,7,5.0,5/9/2014,"I have been here several times and have never been completely impressed.  The cheesecake kept me coming back.  So when my sister suggested we go here for a family dinner I wasn't completely thrilled.  I'm very glad we went.  The food was fantastic and the service amazing.  Our server was Andrew and we could not have asked for better.  He was able to offer suggestions from the very extensive menu.  It was a nice evening so we were seated outside.  We ordered appetizers and I had the firecracker shrimp ""small plate"".  I was surprised by the size.  6 large shrimp and the heat came from the delicious sauce.  There were 6 of us and we all ordered something different for dinner.  The steak (ribeye), salmon and shrimp were all cooked perfectly and no extra salt was needed.  Vanilla bean, chocolate mousse and carrot cake cheesecakes are all wonderful as well.  Overall a much better experience than I expected.  If you go ask to be seated in whatever section Andrew is working.  He was a joy."
Noomie W.,"Fallbrook, CA",191,99,392,5.0,3/25/2012,"Every food I order from them is delicious. Their food is presentable and very tasteful. Their service is pretty great everytime. The macadamia white chocolate cheese cake is soooo...yummy! I used to love their huge appetizer plater that came out in 4-5 different plates, with so many different samplers on it, but unfortunely it is gone n they no longer have it :("
