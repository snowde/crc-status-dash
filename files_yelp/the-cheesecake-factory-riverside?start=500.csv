Kulit S.,"Orange, CA",26,23,13,2.0,6/16/2009,"Don't get me wrong, I love Cheesecake Factory, just not this one.   I went here 3x, and I experienced bad service 3x. The servers are not knowledgeable and bordering rude.   I tried to brush it off the first 2 times, thinking the server is new, or having a rough day.  But the 3rd experience sealed the deal for me.   We ordered appetizers that didn't come, and the server wasn't even sorry about it.  We asked for separate checks and still got a combined one.  And it really bothered me everytime he refilled our drinks, he semi-slammed it on the table.  Where are the manners?"
Brent M.,"Murrieta, CA",65,145,5,5.0,2/17/2012,"This place is awesome.  Andrew was our server last time and did an outstanding job.  Great food, always consistent, and the wait isn't bad for how busy it can get.  I heard they're opening one in Murrieta one of these days which would be awesome.  The bang bang chicken and shrimp is the best!  Best place in Riverside."
Laura R.,"Orange County, CA",799,863,175,3.0,3/19/2009,"I finally found something on their 47 page menu that was worth the money today.  I've been to cheesecake many times (usually because other people LOVE it) and i've never been really impressed. Today, I had the seared ahi salad.  It came with large tomatoes, avocado, mixed greens, and awesome, perfectly seasoned ahi tuna.  So good! It was a nice spring day and we sat outside.  Lots of people watching at this mall.  Our server was awesome - she actually recommended to me the salad when I discovered the ahi appetizer didn't sound like what I wanted."
Christine A.,"Murrieta, CA",62,94,22,4.0,7/19/2011,"A little pricey for dinner ""at the mall"" if you ask me, but the food is good and the portions are big.  We all took at least 1/2 of our plates home with us.  Can't say enough about their cheesecake choices!  On our last visit, we tried the Key Lime Cheesecake, the Cookie Dough Cheesecake, the Banana Cream Cheesecake and the Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake.  Eating here with a large family can be REALLY expensive, but it's an advantage when you want to taste and share a lot of different flavors of cheesecake! Restaurant has a nice ambiance and a very nice bar area. I'm thinking it could be a good option for a night out with the hubby, not just a dinner out with the family."
Cher W.,"Los Angeles, CA",91,174,7,4.0,4/10/2012,I love all my Cheesecake Factories... and this one is no exception.  Chain restaurant with a LARGE variety on the menu. Hardest part is choosing what you want to eat. I typically get the Louisiana Chicken Pasta and I can guarantee that the portion is large you won't be able to finish it.  Cheesecake is always a must. Noms for the tuxedo!  My complaint is the expensive alchy drinks. This girl loves her alchy and Cheesecake is not the place to go for happy hour cocktail drinks.
Stephanie C.,"Hemet, CA",19,39,5,5.0,3/6/2010,"My husband and two kids and I went here for dinner. It was great, great service. We ordered the buffalo blasts for starters and they are delicious. We also had kids menu items and the pasta with sundried tomatoes my husband loved it. Great awesome dinner...Will return ASAP  We took cheesecake to go, and the red velvet cake, melts in your mouth."
Rob W.,"Orange County, CA",34,648,1172,3.0,5/11/2009,"Yah, I like Cheesecake Factory. One thing for sure you'll be good and hungry after you spend 45 minutes looking through the menu.  I hate this ""model"" of CF though. This giant open box of a restaurant. It's so noisy, just not a great dining experience. Why would they do this? The one in Brea is the same. I much prefer the Fashion Island or Spectrum type of layout but, I guess when they build from scratch without having to make the restaurant fit into a certain space they just build a giant open noisy box and cover it with high-end finishes?  Been to this location like 2 times and both times were just OK in the service dept. Cmon, turn it up a little, make me feel like I'm not in Riverside..........oh yah! I mean really, isn't that the point of bringing a restaurant like this here? Make me feel like I'm somewhere else for a minute.  Food was good.  Overall, just A-OK. The Flatbiller Families can have this one.........oh yah.........they got kids and everything!"
Isabel C.,"Corona, CA",2,14,28,5.0,8/8/2012,This place ROCKS!!!! --- i love there mushroom soup & the staff at bar area are friendly the way it should be!!! Awesome place and staff!!!
Megan J.,"Temecula, CA",243,512,139,4.0,10/14/2011,"Came here on a Saturday night around 6 and got seated within 10 minutes...CRAZY!! That's like 3 stars just for that! Our waitress was awesome and got out drinks right away. We had the spinach dip which was kinda weird (a little tooo spinachy). Always loved the bread and butter. I had the Georgia Peach (alcoholic)...Wow. that was gone in 15 minutes. For dinner, I had the pulled pork sandwich and it was pretty decent. We were so full that we didn't get a chance to eat the Cheesecake!! But, we will definitely be back for that next time (maybe just go to bar and get some drinks and cheesecake!). We were there until 745 and the place was super packed and tons of people waiting to be seated. My suggestion is coming before 630 on a Saturday night."
Daisy L.,"Riverside, CA",2,40,2,4.0,2/26/2012,"Came here with hubby for happy hr twice, I have to say I love this place. The drinks are great and so is the service !!"

Andrew P.,"Upland, CA",5,15,,4.0,4/1/2011,It was crowded when I got there but was seated in 20 mins. I was blown away by the Chicken Madeira Pasta. It was too die for. Nice restaurant. Reminds of Luxor in Vegas by the interior design. The lighting is a little too low for my liking. Portions were a lot! Me and my friends had to split and share dishes. It was my friends birthday but they did not have a birthday cake. Sad. Too bad they don't have that.
Jessica G.,"Fontana, CA",1,49,,3.0,3/25/2012,Went there for a birthday dinner. I had the miso salmon and it was pretty good minus it being lukewarm so it kind of ruined it and my boyfriend ordered the steak Diane medium and over half of it came out completely raw. I'd say the once a year trip can stay that way because it is always just ehh especially for the price you pay.
Karen R.,"Winter Garden, FL",25,295,13,2.0,4/15/2013,"We went there Saturday night for dinner.  We were seated very quickly as there were quite a few empty tables but then we sat there for about 10-15 mins without anyone coming over to greet us or take our drink orders.  So we stood up and went back to the check-in desk to request another table where there might actually be a waiter.  We were seated quickly again and this time the server came by quickly.  She was OK when it comes to service.  Not over the top and definitely not as friendly as the waiter that was helping the people next to us.  I ordered a Mai-Tai which was delicious but overly priced.  The calamari appetizer was very good.  I ordered the Ahi tuna dinner and it was just too much food for me so I had to take most of it home.  The taste however was very good.  The husband ordered the New Orleans shrimp and devoured the whole thing.  The bill for 2 people came to $72.  Pricey yes, especially when you consider the bad service we got.  They should have at least comped our drinks or sent over free dessert.  I don't know that we will go back to this location."
Fran A.,"Riverside, CA",0,11,,5.0,4/22/2014,"The cheesecake factory in Riverside was a very pleasant experience....the hostess ""Paige"" helped seat us since we had handicapped needs she made sure we were seated conveniently....she was pleasant and helpful and checked back to make sure everything was going well ....food was excellent....overall a great experience......thanks Paige and staff..."
Christine L.,"Hemet, CA",47,189,99,5.0,9/15/2009,"Went here about a month ago and pretty much splurged on everything from appetizer to drinks to dinner. I love their extensive menu and despite it being a ""cheesecake"" place my son and I both felt comfortable ordering fish dishes.  I have been to other Cheescake Factories before but the service and the food at this location is far superior to the other ones I have been to in the past. Their prices for what you get (quality, presentation, atmosphere) is VERY reasonable. I don't like Cheesecake, but I love the Cheesecake Factory."
JQ V.,"Pittsburg, CA",95,75,49,4.0,3/21/2009,"it's been years since I've last eaten at a Cheesecake Factory Restaurant. We usually go to TGIF or BJs for our usual dining out meal. I decided that we should try something different for a change. Cheesecake factory came into mind.  After a 20 minute wait on a Friday night, we finally got a booth. I'm not really complaining about the wait, I mean, it was Friday, and there were bigger groups than ours.  I ordered the Firecracker Salmon as an appetizer and the Grilled Portabello Burger as my meal. The Firecracker Salmon was delicious! Who knew that wrapping salmon in an egg roll wrapper would be so good! I'm gonna try making this at home! The salmon was cooked with a mixture of spinach and was moist (as a fish type dish should be). The sauce had a little kick to it which setted off the taste delightfully. Four pieces came on a huge bed of red cabbage, which it really didn't need. The Portabello Burger was pretty tasty as well. It was placed on a buttery sesame bun topped with shredded ice burg lettuce. The lettuce was a bit overwhelming. (what's with the overload in veggies?). The grilled red onion on the mushroom brought a nice smokey flavor. I also did taste a friend's mashed potatoes and my where they good!!  Who could go to cheesecake factory without pleasuring yourself to a CHEESECAKE? I ordered the Chocolate Coconut Cheesecake. If you are a HUGE fan of Almond Joy as I am, you would most definitely love this! Cheesecake filling mixed in with bits of coconut shreds topped with a coconut custard over a chocolate macaroon crust dressed in light whipped cream! YUMMY!!! I am dying for another piece!!! Generally I am not a cheesecake fanatic, but I'm in love with this one!  Had a great waiter and an awesome company!"
Brent R.,"Riverside, CA",0,80,23,3.0,7/5/2011,"Ok so i love Cheesecake, so you would think I would love this place but its just Okay, You get large portions when you order but nothing is amazing on the menu.  The cheese cake is very good but the food i just ok. I would order cheesecake to go but would not eat there again."
paul G.,"Riverside, CA",214,68,80,4.0,8/9/2011,"Chicken Parm sandwhich is goooood, also try their humus, one of the best I have ever tried...Get there early if going on the weekend...this place gets packed fast."
