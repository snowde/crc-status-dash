ajay s.,"Norco, CA",11,25,6,5.0,6/29/2011,"I have been going to the Cheesecake Factory for several years now. I have been to a several of their locations on the West and East coast and their product is consistence at every location which speaks volumes about their attention to quality. My favorites at Cheesecake are the Miso Salmon and the Factory Meatloaf. For drinks I stick to the Tropical Smoothie which is HUGE like every serving at Cheesecake, The Cobb salad I recently had was good too. Recommend for family gatherings."
Chantel R.,"Riverside, CA",9,56,26,2.0,10/23/2011,"I've eaten at Cheesecake Factorys from NY to FL to CA. This one has been disappointing more often than not. It works when we can't get out to LA. Not the best location. I've had stove scrapings (pieces of unknown burned food) in my omelette, day-old bread at during the lunch hour, and greasy mashed potatoes. We only go for brunch on Sundays."
Miguel L.,"Temecula, CA",18,64,1,1.0,5/28/2012,Ally the hostess was Rude and inconsiderate! We told her we did not want to sit at the booth she gave us because there would be to much foot traffic and we had our son which uses a booster seat. and she said thats where we are sitting! a few minutes later a different customer was going to be seated next to us and he stated he did not want to sit at the location and she found him a different seat. I expected Better service in a place like this!  The waitress was good.
Nick T.,"San Diego, CA",629,1462,267,3.0,4/14/2009,"Damn, another chain. It seems that chains were the only places that I would get my drink on as I could not find any decent bars to hang out at. Its big its spacious its corporate. No character no charm no soul. Decent food though. Full bar though. Drink up and try to forget that you're living in a sh*thole of a city."
Rowan C.,"Moreno Valley, CA",23,191,54,4.0,5/16/2011,"There's nothing wrong with a chain restaurant especially when they're consistent. This location doesn't miss. It isn't any better or any worse. So if you're in the mood, then don't hesitate to make a stop here."
Jojo L.,"Orange County, CA",104,403,241,5.0,9/5/2010,"i went here last night for my boyfriend's mom's birthday. the wait wasn't too bad, and all the hostesses seemed calm and had everything under control even though the restaurant was super loud / noisy / packed. I love coming to cheesecake factory because they have the BIGGEST menu! They have something for everyone! we got a strawberry daiquiri for the birthday girl and it was pretty delish. down side is that it almost costs as much as an entree! ( and i could make it at home for probably waay cheaper) -i ordered ""bang bang chicken and shrimp"" which is a thai curry with chicken, shrimp, and this coconutty stuff on top. its WONDERFUL!!! if you dont like coconut, just order this and ask for coconuts on the side or without.  -birthday girl ordered ""tomato basil pasta with chicken"". this pasta seriously might have to be the best pasta i have ever had at a restaurant. if you want pasta, i would definitely recommend ordering this. it comes with huge pieces of grilled chicken, and the basil flavor isnt too overpowering.  -my boyfriend ordered ""crispy spicy beef"". this is the entree you order if you want chinese style food at cheesecake. the crispy spicy beef is really flavorful and the meat isnt too dry or anything -boyfriends dad ordered some kind of jumbalaya. i didnt particularly enjoy anything about the jumbalaya here. nothing really stands out, or maybe i just wasnt in the mood for cajun flavors. the servers sing a cute birthday song for you if its your bday and bring your icecream with whipcream. Havent tried their cheesecake yet... but the tiramisu one looks really good. the service is really good here. our waiter was friendly, funny, and was able to describe to us the different kind of flavors in diferrent entrees we had questions about. the decor of this place is really pretty. the ceilings have paintings on them; it kind of reminds me of the Venetian. my boyfriends mom was taking pics of the whole place.."
John F.,"Corona, CA",170,13,3,4.0,11/14/2010,Chicken and biscuits. And steak dianne ummmmm
Melissa A.,"Corona, CA",10,10,,5.0,1/2/2012,Love Cheesecake Factory portions are huge yes but I love that you can always split a plate & the food never disappoints. Usually service is good but I was here on New Year's Eve & well the service was sucking my waitress just disappeared to never return but a great waiter named Tim (I'm pretty sure that was it) saved our night he was so great even though they had ran out of the meatloaf I wanted to order he suggested a lot of other things.
Al S.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",1251,506,242,4.0,3/6/2010,"Why don't they just rename it ""Hamburger Factory with great Mac & Cheese Sides?"" Because this is about my 2nd great burger experience at another CF location. A guy walks into a franchise eatery, and the eatery has ""cheesecake"" in it's name. You tell me...... are you expecting great salads, wonderful chicken madera with garlic mashed potatoes, (as most CF regulars do) ........ or are you a ""veteran Cheesecake Factory Pudgy-guy"", that recently discovered they're actually in the GREAT BURGER BUSINESS? I was awakened at the Huntington Beach location with the CF Classic Burger, with melted chedder added. This past week, I had the Kobe Burger in Riverside; a fine ground beef burger, served with carmelized onions and mushrooms. I, as I always do, added cheeeeessseee..... (Swiss for the Kobe burger), and again, it was very good. So now, I am renaming CF as BF, ""Burger Factory."" Expect to pay about $12 & change for a burger. But expect a really good, char-grilled burger, and if you can, as I did in Riverside, ask for the Mac & Cheese side! OMG........ 4-cheese mac & cheese that, after I added my ground pepper, became my number-one comfort side at any CF location. It was THAT GOOD.  It's simple....... you can chase all over SoCal, if that's where you live, for great burgers. Oooooooooor....... you can drive to a local CF, or BF, if you're in ""stage 2 or 3 Burger Fixation""....... and start with a Classic Burger with cheddar, and a side substitute of the Mac & Cheese. Please message me with your thoughts........ but do it before you too get ""pudgy finger syndrome""...... from adding these burgers and the Mac & Cheese to your weekly, or daily intake. I regard this ""CF to BF Conversion"" very, very seriously. I think I'm on to something here. REALLY IMPORTANT FOOTNOTE: While I travel and eat at Cheesecake Factories around the West Coast, the Riverside location is not my favorite, but OK. While all locations meet a very high standard for chain-restaurants, I do have my favorite city-locations; one is Tigard, Oregon at the mall. But about this burger thing...... my best experience, because I like that ""charcoal grilled flavor"", was definitely at Huntington Beach, but the possibility for ""burger greatness"" should be at any location. I'm going to have to call Huntington Beach and ask them why their burger was sooo ""Char-grilled great""..... as the Kobe at Riverside was very good, but didn't have that same char'd flavor? Still good, but maybe because it was overpowered by the carmelized onion and mushroom it didn't go the distance as the Huntington Beach Classic did. But understand it was a very good burger...... it's just that I'm into maybe stage 4 or 5 of my CF/BF burger fixation! So I have to have the details!!!"
Warren H.,"Manhattan Beach, CA",49,10,,2.0,12/11/2013,"Had dinner on Sunday .. part of a crowd of at least 14 guest .. service during this Christmas holiday was poor .. apparently, they had two servers for our group that were hard to find when we wanted something .. a request for the nutrition facts for the various menu items took three requests .. the bread baskets were often empty for more than 10 minutes as we waited to order (they had taken orders for appetizers, but a noticeable time had passed before they began taking our dinner orders) .."
Tony A.,"Riverside, CA",30,28,9,3.0,5/10/2009,"I only came here once, for the fried mac and cheese. It was outstanding."
Andrea L.,"Orange County, CA",463,353,106,3.0,9/4/2010,"Overall i've had a pretty good time here at cheesecake considering the fact that i've been here several times. The ONLY issue is that SOME of their cheesecakes are just garbage. Spent like 8 bucks on some Kahlua cheesecake last night and boy was I completely unsatisfied. Not only was I not satisfied the staff was dumb enough to leave the paper on one side. Since the ambiance was dark I wasn't really able to notice that there was still some paper, unfortunately I learned the hard way and realized that there was paper in my mouth. Great job STAFF! -_- Anyways I think i'm gonna stick the the original cheesecake so I know for a fact that I will leave a happy customer. BTW the oreo cheesecake was a tad bit overwhelming. I want my 8 bucks back for that garbage Kahlua cheesecake lols. Oh oh oh and 1 more thing the avocado rolls are definitely a MUST have!"
M M.,"Riverside, CA",31,23,,5.0,2/9/2013,Just went for the coconut and pineapple cheesecake for desert. It's mouth watering... It's so unbelievable awesome.........
Jenny C.,"San Diego, CA",225,299,348,3.0,2/7/2007,"This just goes to show you how much Riverside is lacking in ""upscale"" restaurants.  So, when this and PF Changs opened up at the Tyler Mall all hell broke loose.  Poor Cheesecake, they just didn't know that Riverside has been waiting for them.   Geez, parking alone sucks.  Yes, I know they want to expand and make this mall so fabulous, but we need parking spaces!  Not only after having to deal with that do you have to spend a ridiculous amount at the restaurant.  We had to wait over 2 hours to get a table, 1.5 hours to order and get our food, and another 30 minutes for dessert. hahaa..yeah I know it's was the weekend and still considered new opening, whatever SF doesn't even get that bad~  Oh, the food was good of course.  I mean it's cheesecake factory for gosh sakes.  Def try the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp.  So goood and you know I be up on the squaw bread.  MMMmmm..."
nicholas n.,"Huntington Beach, CA",1,112,2,4.0,3/23/2011,"I have eaten here several times, so this is my opinions for the long run. food: 3.5/5 above average with large portion service: 4/5. the wait is long for lunch, but once seated, the service is good. cleanlyness: 5/5 ambiance: 4/5 overall: 4/5.  A decent restaurant for American food.  However, the food does not excite me, despite giving 4/5. You go to eat this food if you can not think of anything else, because you know exactly what you get.  Sometime you want foods that are exciting to the palate,  and this place just ehh!  Having said this, Consumer Reports that this place is rated somewhere #1 or 2 in America by consumers. I usually do not review this kind of place because everybody has eaten at Cheesecake factory, and they already have their own opinions already. So to review this kind of restaurant is redundant.  Since I am bored out of my skull, I threw this in just for the heck of it."
Maria H.,"Long Beach, CA",0,296,3,2.0,4/25/2010,Went here on a Saturday night. Service was kind of slow and food came out intermittently. Got our order wrong and gave us a free appetizer. The same one we canceled because they were out and told us 30 minutes later.  Cheesecake Factory generally has good tasting food but not this one. I was not happy that a place I could rely on disappointed me.
Abraham G.,"Corona, CA",0,1,,5.0,7/28/2013,Since we stepped foot into the restaurant the customer service was excellent our waiter Tony went the extra mile and made our night amazing.
E M.,"Chino Hills, CA",11,53,17,2.0,7/7/2007,"The Cheesecake Factory is relatively new to the area, and is a veritable boon to the Riverside area, which just goes to show how much of a culinary wasteland Riverside is. Yes, the menu reads like a small novel, but with all the ads in the menu it reeks of being very cheesy.  There must be a couple hundred items on the menu, something that certainly must appeal to everyone.  The portions are rather large but as for the quality of the food, that is very questionable. The Chicken Caesar Salad came in a large bowl, and a pretty large portion for lunch.  The chicken was nicely grilled and not dried out, but didn't have much flavor on its own.  That's the good news and it ends there.  The romaine lettuce was wilted with brown spots scattered throughout.  What's worse, or maybe it just seems like it, was that the salad was just swimming in dressing.  It's like they were trying to hide the shortcomings of the lettuce. The wait to eat here is very long and the service was less than desired.  At least I got a piece of free cheesecake for their service blunders."
Tony K.,"Honolulu, HI",100,250,43,4.0,7/21/2010,We really like this location.  It gets busy but I've never seen it as busy as some of the other locations.  I've never had any problems here and the food is pretty consistent.  You have to check in your strollers up front so don't expect to bring back big strollers if you have them.   Good all around menu that has something for everybody.
Debbie W.,"Riverside, CA",0,37,4,3.0,3/19/2010,"Huge portions of food.  I always take half home for lunch the following day.  The kids like the pasta and pizza.  I'm a fan for the Romano Crusted Chicken Pasta with Alfredo Sauce.  They give you three large pieces of chicken with pasta and ample sauce.  Desserts are incredible, but I generally don't have room, so we take them to go.  In the evenings and weekends the wait can be very long.  Very expensive!"
