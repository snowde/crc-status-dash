Tara M.,"Claremont, CA",45,137,150,3.0,4/4/2010,"So it's Easter, the kids are at their dad's and I'm not feeling like chicken pot pie al a freezer. In fact I'm feeling like shrimp, and possibly a steak. I decide on CF because previous experiences have always been good. I'm by myself so the waiter seats me in the bar, which works it means I can watch the game. I'm seated, I order a coke, and begin traversing the menu for my lovely little shrimp. I don't like fried shrimp as it makes crispy, greasy rubber. The waiter brings my drink, brings bread and checked back a couple times for my order. They had a couple options I settle on my go to guy Shrimp Scampi, with Steak Diane medium rare and an appetizer of stuffed mushrooms. The Mushrooms were great, they had a nice herb flavor, the sauce was slightly sweet from the white wine, the texture was wonderful, slightly firm, not slimy or squishy. I was primed, ready and waiting for the main course.  The Shrimp while flavorful was over cooked, as was the steak. I was served 4 medallions, a generous proportion two were well done and like rubber, the other two were overcooked but not as badly. The mashed potatoes are excellent garlic mashed, skin included, and not the smooth potato clouds, but chunky with wonderful texture. As I sat and ate the waiter asked a couple time if I'd like a box, I let him know I was still eating, the last time I just asked for the check. As I said this is not my first experience with CF, and not my first time in this store. Next time I will stay with the soup and 1/2 sandwich."
Marc R.,"Upland, CA",0,2,2,4.0,2/18/2013,"I am a major fan of The Cheesecake Factory, and I have decided to write a review about it. Even on weekends, I feel that I don't have to wait that long to be seated. Their menu has many different choices, and they have large portions, so you come out satisfied. But there is a different option for those who want to have The Cheesecake Factory experience, but less in calories. Their ""SkinnyLicious"" menu, comes with similar choices as their main menu, but all meals are less than 600 calories.  I ate their Fettuccini Alfredo, and it was delightful. It had a rich, creamy parmesan sauce, and it was completed with sliced, tender chicken, scattered on top. My wife took the SkinnyLicious Grilled Turkey Burger, and it came in a small portion, and she said it was very tasty. For dessert, we shared the OREO Dream Extreme Cheesecake. It was marvelous! The different layers of fudge and cheesecake was astonishing and the chocolate icing on top made it taste like heaven. Of course, I will come back for more, and the price of only $60.00 was amazing."
Jip Z.,"Austin, TX",40,202,277,2.0,1/17/2012,"I decided to cash in a gift card here this past Monday and showed up around lunch time. We were seated within 15 minutes and the location of our booth was pretty good. The waitress who took our order had zero personality and didn't crack one smile the entire time she was helping us. I ordered a tropical drink that lacked any alcohol. It was such a crappy drink that my friend who also ordered one, had to request a double shot in the second one he got. I decided to stick with water. We got an appetizer of Spinach and artichoke dip which was very good although $10 for an appetizer is kind of steap in my opinion. The food runner who brought it to us was just a delight (sarcasm), she pushed it onto our table while shoving all other objects out of its way with the plate and exclaimed ""Spinach dip""... Myself and my guests just stared at eachother like ""uh, okay?"" I probably didnt need to order anything else but I got the fish taco's. They were pretty good... but the rice and beans didnt arrive until I was already finished with two of them. My friend got a burger and my son got a pizza. The childrens pizza was huge. In fact all of our food was huge and pretty good. I cant complain. It was basically the service that I disliked. Although our server was on top of us and got us everything we needed, she seemed like she was in a bad mood and we felt like we were burdoning her with our visit. I've been to several Cheesecake Factory's and I always seem to get the same crappy service. This time wasn't even the worst but it certainly sealed my opinion of the place. I'm not coming back."
Julie W.,"Riverside, CA",0,3,,3.0,3/19/2013,Been to this place twice I like the food but what happened to children's menus? Never got one for my child. Do they have any?
Jayden L.,"Arcadia, CA",0,94,4,3.0,6/19/2012,Love their cheesecakes no matter what! But their entrees.. are just decent.. Service is usually good. Good free bread too :P
Cat L.,"Hermosa Beach, CA",194,402,491,3.0,8/30/2007,"I know it ain't much, but I'm sorta glad Cheesecake and PF Chang's opened in Riverside. Maybe in a few more years, an Olive Garden and a BCD Tofu House will find niches in the IE as well and I won't feel so ashamed that I went to UCR. I came here for Valentine's Day I think last year (lame, I know!) because I had a midterm that got out late and had to stay local for dinner plans. It felt like Christmas fighting for a parking spot near the Tyler Mall and waiting out in the cold for almost an hour. But the food, classic Cheesecake Factory ambiance, and service was typical of what one would expect at any other Cheesecake, so it was all good."
Dayna L.,"Moreno Valley, CA",4,25,,5.0,12/29/2010,"I love this place! the Chicken Meidera is wonderful! and the Endive salad is perfect! and you must try the Chicken samosa app! its so yummy!!!!!!! my husband had the Filet Mignon and loved it! very good food, and service! they have great tropical Ice Tea! and I don't  have to comment on the Cheesecake you should already know how good it is!"
Jenny S.,"Corona, CA",0,2,,4.0,9/26/2010,"Me and my boyfriend went to eat lunch and we ordered fried mac and cheese for appetizer and it was so delicious we couldn't stop eating it. It was just warm fried cheesy goodness. Then he ordered the kobe beef burger and it was huge. I got the filet mignon, a bit pricey but so worth it. At the end of the meal we were so stuffed. The service was great too(:"
Donna H.,"Fairhope, AL",22,232,,5.0,6/4/2009,"I don't know if it's fair to rate a restaurant if you always order the same thing, but I've had this one dish in CFs from D.C. to West Des Moines, IA to Riverside and it's one of my all-time favorites -- it's the garlic noodles with shrimp (has asparagus, sun-dried tomatoes and shitake mushrooms) and it's to die for.  My husband likes their chicken Caesar salad.  If you've been to a CF, you know their portions are big enough to feed a family of four, but I like having leftovers for the next day.  Everyone who's been with us when dining there has been pleased with their entrees, so although it's a big, impersonal chain, I think it's one of the better ones."
Talmadge M.,"Pasadena, CA",210,208,55,4.0,5/30/2009,"I had the fish and chips dinner, it was plentiful and our servers were pleasant.  My first visit believe it or not.  I try not to get caught up in the hype."
Frank B.,"Long Beach, CA",117,2,,4.0,11/8/2008,"I usually come to the Cheesecake Factory just for dessert, but this time I came for dinner with a few friends.  The service was awesome mostly because the server (Colin) was there enough but not annoyingly lingering.  The food was pretty good considering its a corporate ran American Restaurant.  Ask to be seated at Colin's area he is great.."
monica a.,"Riverside, CA",0,11,1,2.0,8/3/2011,"the service was ok, its a sit down place, so 20 minutes wait between appetizers and food is expected (4 guests). the cheesecakes are good, which honestly i think they spend their energy on perfecting rather than their dishes. ive came back to this place several times giving it another shot trying new things on the menu that sounded delicious, each time left me thinking, 'now i gotta finish this' and i never finished my plate. the food just didnt hit it for me and i doubt i'll be coming back soon."
Able A.,"Corona, CA",4,181,1,1.0,4/18/2012,"Last week, my family and I were hungry at about 10 pm and most restaurants closed near Tyler Street in Riverside except this restaurant. After we sat down, we waited 16 minutes for the waitress to take our orders and 55 minutes for the food. The waitress never came back with water or acknowledgment how long we needed to wait for our food! We brought it to the manager's attention with our professional comments. I asked for his name, which he refused. Not only that he did not value our business, he also has a sharp tongue barking at me like a mad dog shouting, ""It takes 15 minutes to take 2 orders, 40-45 minutes to cook a spaghetti with meat sauce. I will not compensate you. Your complaint is unnecessary. I came from England and also have an accent like you. Pay your bill and leave now, or I will call the security."" He ordered his waiter to call the security while he used his middle finger to signal me to pay and leave. I was embarrassed in front of other customers by this man, who was bold enough to discriminate, threaten and intimidate me with his physical size twice of mine. Not only the food was cold, tasteless, hardly any meat in the sauce, 99% is pasta with no value for the price; the manager also created a hostile environment for dining. He is anti-customers for making complaints. We rather go hungry than eat at this outrageous place, not even for free. It was a horrific restaurant that we ever experienced!"
Alfonso L.,"Moreno Valley, CA",78,29,33,5.0,3/25/2011,"Service, service, service, if your ready to be wined and dined this is the place to be. The cheescake factory in riverside is by far one of the best. As soon as we arrived we were directly seated. And greeted by our server. I ordered the boston house salad for the second time and let me tell you it was just as good as the first time I tried it. For my meal I ordered the shrimp and chicken gumbo. So excellent the spices and huge portions of shrimp and chicken were very generous, our server ryan was on top of his game refilling our drinks and making sure we were happy every few minutes. This is something I really enjoy I like to be catered on and not forgotten and ryan made sure I never felt neglected. I really wish everyone can enjoy this excellent level of service I had just experienced. I hate to say this but ryan set the bar really high and I will be returning soon thanks cheesecake factory"
Katherine O.,"Anaheim, CA",161,572,28,2.0,7/31/2008,"I'm not a big fan of the Cheesecake Factory, but I'll go If someone else wants to. I went with co-workers on their $1.50 cheesecake day. Knowing it would be ridiculously busy, we got there at 11:30 and amazingly, the place was empty. We were seated right away in the patio. Our server came around and took our drink orders, brought the drinks out and then we didn't see her for 20 minutes. We ordered and waited an hour for our food. By this time, the restaurant was packed. Our server must have had friends in the patio, because she kept chatting with someone in the corner. We flagged her down and asked her to check on our food and she was totally rude when she said, ""We are busy."" We pointed out that other people who'd gotten there after us, got their food, even though we all ordered off their lunch menu. We decided to order our cheesecake slice at that time, knowing it might take awhile. Funny though, our food came out seconds later by other servers. My salad didn't come with any dressing (it had like two dots of bbq sauce so I thought that was the bbq part), so I walked into the kitchen and actually talked to the chef about the missing ranch, meanwhile managers and servers didn't pay any attention to me, while I rummaged around looking for ranch (could this be a sanitation problem?). Finally, I asked someone for help and she poured me a side. I got outside, saw our server passing by and told her that my salad didn't come with dressing... then she said, ""Oh, do you want bbq ranch dressing?"" Umm yeah, I ordered a bbq chicken salad. It took her 5 minutes to get the dressing, when it only took me two minutes and I didn't even know where the ranch was! We ate quickly (by this time, we'd been at the restaurant close to an hour and a half) and asked for our bills, boxes and to check on the cheesecake. Again, another, ""We are busy- the kitchen is backed up"" response from our server. The boxes and bill came out in a minute. When I went to put my salad in my togo container, I found a hair in the salad and it was definitely not mine! Eew, gross, I'd been eating a salad with someone else's hair in the bottom. Needless to say, I left the salad. More waiting... finally, I flagged down a manager and asked him to check on our cheesecake and to please take our bill. Bill came out in seconds... cheesecake another 10 minutes. Apparently, Cheesecake Factory didn't premake any of the cheesecakes even though they knew it was going to be a busy day? If it had been me, I would have made a bunch in advance and frozen them, even if the quality was slightly compromised because people were paying $1.50 per slice and you expect that it isn't going to be the same quality as a normally $8 slice. Finally, after our two plus hour dining experience, our cheesecake slices came out. They were tiny slices with more whip cream than anything, but I can't complain, because again, it was $1.50.  I learned my lesson and don't think I'll frequent this Cheesecake Factory again, because even though it was a promotion and super busy a) rudeness is unacceptable, and b) there was a hair in my salad."
Heather H.,"Ames, IA",60,103,103,4.0,9/15/2008,"I usually only come to this restaurant on fridays during lunch and I haven't really had any problems. The service and the food have always been good. My only complaints are the prices of some of the entrees and the ads in the menus. I hate ordering the Crispy Beef with no beef (rice, veggies, sauce) and being charged $15 (only one time I was charged less, the server was REALLY good). All of the other vegetarian options are worn out for me. I also hate paying $10 for a small bowl of pasta during lunch. I understand it's a little more upscale than other places locally, but the prices aren't justified. $3.25 for a soda is insane too. Luckily, the portions are big enough to share. Smaller portions  and smaller prices would be nice. The ads in the menus, tacky. Overall, I enjoy this place. You have to wait, but YES, you're at a more upscale restaurant, the table turnover rate is a lot slower. The food takes longer to prepare and the customers stay longer to talk.  Kasarin O. - I can't believe how incredibly RUDE you were. You do NOT walk into the kitchen area if you are not an employee. I don't care how bad the service was, that's completely unacceptable."
Jaimie L.,"Newport Beach, CA",8,16,,1.0,4/8/2011,"WORSSSSSSST service. No exaggeration. The food at Cheesecake is always good without a doubt.. but I had one of the worst experiences EVER. The hostess did her job, and when we were seated the waitress took ten minutes to even notice it. We didn't mind because we were chatting and enjoying ourselves. Then she finally brings out the bread and says shell be right with us. Her name started with an 'R' I believe! She had ONE other table and there was about an hour until closing. She arrives another 5 minutes later to ask for our drinks. At this time we were ready to order our entrees and that's what we did along with an appetizer. Another FIVE minutes pass and she brings the other table some side dishes and leaves ONE drink at our table and says shell be back. At this point I was furious.. she then comes back with the wrong drink and brings us a cold appetizer. We wait about 20 minutes for our entrees and then the manager comes to our table and says 'SORRY LADIES, WERE CLOSED SO DID YOU LADIES MAYBE WANT TO JUST ORDER A DESERT?' .......  ARE YOU KIDDING ME. I explained how long we waited and that we had ordered and we did so BEFORE the restaurant was closing but obviously the lousy server couldn't get our orders in on time. He showed NO SORROW. He was a complete moron that does NOT deserve a manager title. If you have an idiotic waitress that ordered from and sat a table you better make DAMN sure they not only get a meal but have some things comp'd. Worse service I've EVER experienced. We just left the table without our cold appetizer. YOU SUCK. Hope they read this."
J F.,"Riverside, CA",12,6,,4.0,5/31/2011,"so it was memorial day and while i was out with my boyfriend we got hungry. we didnt have any set plans and while we were at the mall we wanted to sit down somewhere to eat. we didnt have much time and out choices were going to be limited. we decided to walk into the cheesecake factory and hope that there was a small table for two available somewhere, as soon as we walked in we were both greeted right away by two great hostesses. when i asked them if there were any tables left for a walk in she said ""yes, we can seat you right now."" what a relief that was. we got to our table right away and told about the happy hour specials that they had. great starters for only $5!!!  we ordered our beverages and to start off we had the ""avocado eggrolls.""  when our drinks arrived we were ready to order also and the waitress we had was very kind. the eggrolls were actually very good and not bad at all for $5. the kitchen was pretty fast at making our orders too. as soon as our appetizer was done, our food arrived. so our table was never foodless at all. he ahd a burger and a i had a chicken plate. both were good. i was skeptical about mine upon orderring because it said it has assparaguse on it which is something i have never had before. they sort of reminded me of garbanzo beans and my boyfriend said they were kind of bland. other than that everything else was delicious. we were actually quite full after our meals and didnt really have room for any dessert but how can you go to the cheesecake factory and not have a slice right? so we decided to grab a slice to go. we had a slice of the ""red velvet cheesecake."" although we waited about 2 hours to eat it after we got home, it was great!!!   so how would i rate this place? It was nice and clean. the staff that helped us was very nice. the only thing i didnt like was having to see and listen to the other staff stand and talk to each other in the corner. not that i care if they dont work, but i dont want to hear what youre talking about.  the food was delicious although the lemonade is very sour. i actually cook for a living and well, that says a lot because i am picky. would i go back? most likely, yes!! thank you guys for being able to accomodate us on a walk in basis and on a holiday!!!"
Jen N.,"Henderson, NV",68,316,115,4.0,3/11/2008,"give me some thai pasta!  im pretty sure im not the only one that thought this place only served cheese cake...and im not a cheese cake person, so i cant comment on that, but all i get here is the thai pasta and fried mac and cheese balls.  granted they only give you two but they are huge! they have reasonable lunch menu which is great for a gal on the go... they also have valet, because during peak hours, parking is scarce...but again, they shouldnt have placed this so close to PF Changs..."
Ryan G.,"Upland, CA",104,7,1,2.0,12/6/2010,"I have gone to this location a few times always thinking the next visit will be better and have not yet had the better experience..The service is slow,the food mediocre and the price of drinks is high...not too impressed with this oplace"
