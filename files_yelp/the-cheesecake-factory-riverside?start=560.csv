AbbaWobb A.,"Riverside, CA",24,230,7,4.0,10/6/2007,"This place is great.  I don't understand why put down a restaurant just because it is a chain.  It has good service.  The parking is an iffy - but I think there is valet parking.  I like most of the items I've tried there.  Chicken Piccata, Ranch BBQ Salad, etc.  The cheesecakes are fun to try but no big deal.  The decor is nice but confusing.  What is the theme supposed to be?  Egyptian?  Italian?  Anyways - it is a nice  lunch place."

Junkfoodie Q.,"NY, NY",12,372,,4.0,2/13/2007,"The fact that Riverside now has a Cheesecake Factory proves how much it has changed since I used to live there.  YAY Riverside!  =P.  I give this 3.75 stars (marked down because of how long I always had to wait to be seated). I'll almost always stuff myself with a basket (or two) of their bread, then order the avocado eggroll appetizers! soooo good!!....last time I was there I had the mixed-berry almond crunch cheesecake which I liked a lot.  Their fresh banana cheesecake and chocolate mousse cheesecake are also pretty good.... I remember their quesadillas being pretty good (back when I was in my quesadilla phase) and I've tasted their bang-bang chicken which was also good.  From what I remember, their club sandwich and california cheesesteak sandwich were just ok. ALWAYS a long wait to be seated, no matter which location I've been at (Brentwood, Beverly Hills, Newport Beach, Long Island, San Francisco, Riverside....)  but at least I can always look forward to those yummy avocado eggrolls!! Large portions, more upscale atmosphere, and good service."
Dani W.,"Perris, CA",20,5,,4.0,1/24/2012,"My first time i went was a couple yars ago and i got a tri tip sandwhich and i really did not like it but my husband and i go there to get cheekcakes all the time, but we really didnt like the food there. We got gift cards for there for Xmas so we thought, hey we will go and give it another go. OMG both mine and my husbands dinner was AMAZING! I will deff be going back. They prises i thought were kinda high but when the waitor placed our plates in front of us, holy cow! huge portion of posta, and it turns out we had half left over for lunch for the next day. The service was terrific, the nicest and most hard working waitor i have ever had, left him a very very nice tip. And of coarse we got cheesecake for dessert  and it is by far the best i have ever tasted, the different verieties they have is mouth watering It is very hard to deside which one to get they have lots to choose from. They have just about every kind of cheesecake you could possibly emagine. Deff a place u need to have close by you when your craving a lusious treat!"
