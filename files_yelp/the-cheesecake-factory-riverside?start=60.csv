Reginald C.,"Moreno Valley, CA",0,4,,4.0,2/22/2017,Question. What kind of bear is best? That's a ridiculous question. False. Black bear. That's debatable. There are basically two schools of thought-- Fact. Bears eat beets. Bears. Beets. Battlestar Galactica. Bears do not... What is going on?! What are you doing?!
Aaron D.,"San Bernardino, CA",26,21,15,2.0,3/10/2017,I rate them two stars because the shepherd pie is very good along with they're cheesecakes....  How ever the service is horrible just about every time we have dined here the wait staff have been a issue... From they're I hate my job attitude to the orders being messed up...  Dinner was a mess aside from the shepherds pie... Nacho are gross unless you been drinking all night...
Chuck T.,"Corona, CA",36,28,47,2.0,4/26/2017,My favorite item on the menu is no longer. Chicken di pana is gone. I ordered a New York steak instead. Expecting a nice sized steak for $20 bucks I got this small piece of meat. Was cooked perfectly but flavorless. I had a better steak a few days ago at Apple Bees for half the price. Our waiter was good but the food changed since my last visit. My sons normally eat every piece of food off their plate but not tonight. Neither finished their burgers or fries said the fries were flavorless and the burger bun was over toasted. Sorry Cheesecake Factory you just lost a loyal customer.
Karina F.,"Riverside, CA",86,52,129,4.0,1/8/2017,"First time at this restaurant and I enjoy it. Super busy and long wait but was worth it. This restaurant has so many options for food. Also a menu for low calories. I order a salad and it was delicious. Will come back again fersure.  Ps, their lemon cheesecake was bomb!"
KDS s.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,3,,1.0,1/7/2017,"Was told to come  1 hour before wanting to be steated.  2 hours later still not seated.  Manager is seating people with 2/ 3 in party. She said i can't put you party over there  , I can't get you a table for another 2 hours. So much for a Happy Birthday with friends and family.  My advice  Don't Go unless you pack a lunch. Don't go unless you don't have anything else to do that night. DON'T GO ON A SATURDAY WITH MORE THAN 2 IF YOU WANT TO EAT WITHIN AN 2 HOUR!"
Dennis T.,"North Las Vegas, NV",581,846,10004,4.0,12/3/2015,"I recently returned to this Cheesecake Factory, and this time began with Pan-Fried Chicken Pot Stickers swimming in Soy-Ginger Sesame Sauce that were well cooked and enjoyable.  This was followed by a delicious cup of New England Clam Chowder that was very hot, dirty looking, somewhat spicy, and chockful of clams and chunks of potatoes.     Then while Diane raved about her Pit Beef Dip with tasty au jus, I was pleased with my entree of homey-tasting Famous Factory Meatloaf, which came with nice and thick Brown Gravy, Succotash, and good but thin rather than creamy Mashed Potatoes.  The corn kernels in the Succotash were a bit hard.  Otherwise, there was little to find fault with regarding food preparation. Our booth seat was hard, and the room cool on a cold day.  And, while service from our server doubling as a bartender was slow initially, it picked up and was fine the rest of the way. A fine comfort meal overall!"
Lauro A.,"Jacksonville, NC",10,11,3,2.0,11/19/2017,"I just want to start off by saying that I love the Cheesecake Factory. I have always had  good experiences at other Cheesecake Factories, both with quality of food and customer support - Which is why I am disheartened at the experience I received at this location. I came to the Cheesecake Factory to celebrate my soon to be grandmother in-laws 70th birthday with the family - my fiancé, her parents and siblings - A large party of 7 (5 adults 2 children). We waited about 10 minutes just to be seated. The table that we were brought to was a 6-person booth with a chair hanging out in the walkway for the 7th, which was an awkward sit for my father in-law. The table was extremely cramped and would have been very difficult to try to eat and with everyone seated. When my father in-law tried to talk to a waiter to be seated at a different table we were we were blown off and told to go back to the front area, where we waited for 30 minutes while several other large parties passed us by. It wasn't until my fiancé reminded the hostess that we were still waiting that they made a real attempt to set up a table outside. The staff seemed irritated that they where tasked to set up the table, sloppily and recklessly moved the table after we asked to have to the table moved away from the direct entrance to the patio. After the long wait to be seated we finally started to get some service and our waiter is a lot of the reason that we are not giving this visit 1 star. While the wait left little to be desired we held out for the food. Now the disappointment goes full circle. I ordered the Americana and was not disappointed neither was my fiancé with her bacon ham burger. We had ordered the sweet potato fries in Lou of the regular fries. My fiancé's fries were burnt and mine were cold which is a let-down - I was looking forward to their warm fries. My mother had ordered the teriyaki chicken and we were not informed that they did not cut up the Chicken it just comes out as the breast, bone and all. Now that being an error on our part, the waiter who was praised earlier seemed a bit rude to us while we explained that it was not what we were expecting and wanted to get it fixed up. Now we are getting our desserts and ready to be on our way we wait an additional 15 minutes for our already pre ordered to go meal to be brought to us even though it was prepared at the begging of the meal. Timeline for all of this starts at around 4:30 when we walked in it is now 7 and we are finally able to leave after squaring the check and receiving all of our food. The experience was not a pleasant one."
P V.,"Temecula, CA",13,49,45,4.0,8/12/2017,The Thai Coconut Lime Chicken w/Brown rice ROCKS and I love the touch of fresh Mango they have on this specialty dish!
Tish W.,"Moreno Valley, CA",17,133,183,4.0,3/8/2017,"My husband and I got a gift card so we decided to take the family. It was a really nice evening. My daughter and I ordered off of the skinny menu, my husband got a burger, and my son got his stole chicken tenders. I can totally comment on his chicken tenders they were delicious. On my next visit I will be getting the adult version.  Our server was attentive and the food good. My son got the Oreo cheesecake which was delicious. All in all a great family evening. Always enjoy the ambiance of the Cheesecake Factory."
Shyanne K.,"Wood Streets, Riverside, CA",5,1,,2.0,11/20/2017,"Horrible wait time, We got there at 6:00 didn't get seated until 8:15. I had to ask twice until I finally got my bread. I ordered a strawberry lemonade, and only got one refill, and that was after I finished my meal. I ordered the chicken fettichini and it was COLD! Worst experience I had here. This was my favorite place to come but it turned to the worst."
Abby L.,"Anacortes, WA",120,32,6,5.0,8/19/2017,I love Cheesecake Factory and this one did not disappoint. We were seated quickly and food was as expected - delicious!
Tedman N.,"Fontana, CA",51,40,51,3.0,10/12/2017,"We came here with a big party for my friend's 21st birthday. Growing up, I never really ate at Cheesecake Factory's and went once during my 8th grade promotion. I was pretty excited to try it once again. Personally, I think Our party had two waiters, who were efficient on getting us water, bread refills, and taking our orders correctly. However, management here seems to be terrible. On a Tuesday night, they ran out of Calamari and Buffalo wings. So that takes a BIG no-no from me. How are you going to run out of those popular appetizers when the week barely started? Anyways, I personally ordered the Americana Burger medium-rare with a side of fries which came out to be 15 dollars. Burger portion was HUGE. 4 of the people in our group each ordered a burger, but only one of us was able to fully finish it. I recommend sharing a meal here, since it will save you money. Taste-wise it wasn't bad but it definitely wasn't worth the price point in my opinion, I'm sure there are better things to order on the menu. Also, it didn't help that the burger couldn't fit in your mouth. Overall, if it wasn't for the excellent service this place would get a 2/5 from me. However I am only criticizing their price points from the burger I ordered and the terrible stock management. Other locations may be better, but as a whole the Cheesecake Factory menu has good variety and it does have that semi-fancy atmosphere perfect for birthdays or nice occasions."
Phil S.,"Vero Beach, FL",0,16,,1.0,11/16/2017,"So just tried to place a simple to go order over the phone here. I was transferred over to the bakery. I waited five minutes and thought hmmm that's strange, no answer. So I called back to their regular number they have listed and once again waited another five minutes, no answer. So I called back again, and told the woman who answered the phone that I had been transferred twice, and both times waited five minutes with no answer. She claimed they are extremely busy and that she would be happy to transfer me again. I declined and told her I would order from somewhere that actually cares about their customers. Seriously a shameful response. Any employee worth half their salt would have just taken my order and walked it over to the to-go section. Terrible customer service, I will never eat at the riverside location because of this."
Soraya N.,"Moreno Valley, CA",41,34,15,5.0,8/12/2017,I love this cheesecake and I went there at least in 10 different times and occasions. The location and atmosphere are perfect. I had several different entrees. All were great. The proceed are higher that regular restaurant but it does worth it considering the qualitythe services were always perfect
Christina D.,"San Bernardino, CA",5,7,2,1.0,6/11/2017,"Today was a good day. I decided to end it with a family outing to The Cheesecake Factory. I was a bit thrown back at the fact that the restaurant seemed unkept. The floors were filthy, the walk way in the lobby looked as though drinks had been spilled, the floor under the table across from us had pickles and lettuce all over it. In the woman's restroom the trash cans were overflowing with paper towels and the stalls were not tended to. When I was returning to my table I slipped on a price of food. Embarrassing! I ordered the avocado toast, a dish I've ordered often and absolutely love. When my food arrived I immediately took a bite, my excitement was short lived when my mouth filled with the taste of burnt toast. Now I know toast is usually slightly dark but this was blackened.  When the waitress came to check on us we let her know that my dish was burnt. She immediately took it back and sent over the manager. When the manager arrived he started with, ""I'm sorry you feel it was burnt but that is how toast is made."" Then proceeded to explain the correct way to toast bread. Before I could speak he interrupted with, ""What else can I bring you?"" I told him I had lost my appetite and would not like anything else. Then he quickly responded with, ""I'm sorry you feel that way, but the dish was made correctly."" No apology then walks away. He was so rude in the way he spoke to me the waitress apologized for his behavior.  She had the dish removed from our bill. The manager should have done that but he offered no accommodation for the over cooked food. Feeling irritated and lectured, I grabbed my purse and headed for the door. After paying the bill and tipping the waitress, who was great by the way, my husband got the managers attention and told him that he didn't appreciate the way he spoke to me or how filthy the restaurant looked. Also that we would not be returning. It's disappointing because i go there often and have my office lunches there."
Vivien E.,"Lake Elsinore, CA",94,8,,3.0,3/31/2017,The service was fine. My waiter was Kevin. He was nice. However I did not enjoy the food. I barely touched the orange chicken and the spinach artichoke dip was dismal. However my party enjoyed Thier meals. I did love the Lemon cake amazing. I'll come again
Annamarie P.,"Riverside, CA",170,47,21,3.0,8/6/2017,"Waitress was wonderful!!!  We went there for our sixth anniversary. Our food was good except my husband's carrots were not fully cooked and badly cut.  They looked like 3-, 4-, or 5- years old chop them.  Not nice cutting. My husband knew it was not properly cut because he knows since he's a chef. My husband decided to save carrot and bring home to re-cook them. For my dinner, it was good but very little undercooked pasta but wonderful meal anyways. They were so sweet to write happy anniversary on our cheesecakes."
Dwight C.,"Hemet, CA",140,233,76,4.0,3/13/2017,"Service was superb and wait staff friendly, attentive, and made each diner feel like they were the only customer.  I ordered a spaghetti dish and did not care for the taste of the spices. Spaghetti & Meatballs should taste like the name implies not like something else! Next time will try one of the other items on the menu and hope it tastes like its name!"
Nijole T.,"Los Angeles, CA",3080,6372,5149,3.0,11/1/2016,"Enormous menu, way too many options, you get bored with the menu, way too much reading and way too overwhelming. Service was rushed, they are way too busy to offer great service. Prices are a bit high for the quality that you get, don't expect great meats, best to stick to the basic dishes. You can tell the food is mass produced and while it is a bit better than some of your run of the mill chain restaurants, it's not a place I would chose to return to."
Violeta V.,"Riverside, CA",0,11,11,5.0,3/22/2017,"Just had dinner here and sat in the bar area and I must say I had some of the best service ever. Our waiter, Courtney, was awesome! Very attentive and super quick. Totally made us feel welcomed and like we were his most important customers. I'm always looking for places with great customer service and today I will add this place on my list. Will definitely come back just because of the customer service. P.S. Lindsey, the waitress that took over while Courtney went on his break, was great also.  Once again, great customer service!"
