Aaron C.,"Riverside, CA",196,38,13,5.0,8/22/2017,"We came here for Sunday brunch and I had the chicken and waffles. It came with potatoes and two poached eggs with hollandaise. Every single piece of food on the plate tasted great by itself, so combining only made it better. The service here is also very prompt, which I've noticed almost every time I've been here."
Jen S.,"Laguna Hills, CA",606,511,3331,5.0,4/18/2016,"Alexa is the BEST!!! Happy to have snagged a seat at the bar area while we were waiting for our names to be called. The wait wasn't long, but with a hungry man, too long nonetheless. Despite how crowded it was, Alexa made our impromptu dining experience fantastic. Probably one of the best dining experiences I've had at a Cheesecake Factory. Enjoyed their bread and butter and Georgia Peach blended cocktail while we waited for our meal. Edamame was savory and salty best enjoyed piping got. The avocado roll appetizer has this delicious sweet pesto type sauce, but yes, sweet in a very tasty way. As always, my go-to is the Bang Bang Chicken. It's a pretty busy location, but be sure to ask for Alexa and no doubt you will have the best dining experience with your family as I had."
AJ T.,"Idyllwild, Idyllwild-Pine Cove, CA",0,6,,5.0,10/29/2017,"I like this location, it's cleaner than the one I've visited. Our server was great. Overall we had a good service"
Michael E.,"Tustin, CA",521,186,1768,4.0,8/3/2015,"As far as big chain restaurants go I love this one, specifically this location. When it first opened I thought it was going to fall victim to the riverside curse (for some reason restaurants close down here left and right).  It was always dead inside. Fast forward years later and this location is booming.  Not that it matters to me how many people are inside, I always sit at the bar. But I'm glad it picked up, I really enjoy my time alone here.  I love that they keep the menu fresh. Constantly changing recipes, menu options, etc. It's alway clean here and the staff is amazing. One thing I love about being a regular is getting to know the bartenders.  Portions are decent sized, and substitutions dont seem to be a problem.  Located in the outsie corner of the mall, parking could be a little better, but it's not too bad. If youve never been to a cheesecake, I recommend this location."
Ed V.,"Yorba Linda, CA",0,12,2,1.0,12/4/2016,"Manager told us wait time was 40-50 min , then we get buzzed in 20min later. We went in and he says they accidentally buzzed us in and but that it's now a 1hr 30min wait time. So if they didn't ""accidentally"" buzz us in, we would've been waiting the 40-50 mins. for them to then tell us oh it'll be another hour. The management could've handled this situation better and made our party pleased.  Managers mistake on calculating our wait time .We left to Claim jumpers down the street where they take reservations ."
Melissa R.,"Claremont, CA",317,214,275,4.0,6/19/2017,"I rarely go to Cheesecake Factory, as I try to focus my support on local businesses, but this location was worth reviewing, mainly for the service. I last ate here a few days ago during what seems one of their peak times. I went with my coworkers for a farewell lunch, so we had a big group. We called before going to try to reserve, but since they were expecting many large parties due to graduations, they would not allow reservations. Without thinking it through, we decided to go anyway... which led us to a 1.5 hour wait, just to be seated. I know a lot of people are upset about the wait times, but really, what could have been expected?  I spoke to Iris, one of the managers, who accommodated our large group as best as she could. I requested that we order before we got seated so that they could start on our order, and she graciously allowed it, knowing that we had been waiting for a while. I'm pleased with the way she handled this stressful situation. As far as the food goes, it's exactly what you would expect... huge portions, lots of calories, and generally good. I really don't have much to add in this department that others haven't mentioned before me."
Armen M.,"Fontana, CA",94,25,,1.0,7/16/2017,"Posed off after last night, I'll keep it short.  Order food and drinks, tell the waiter we're extremely thirsty and he takes over 15 minutes to get them.  I call the guy it on it and he say the busy and we have our drinks now so we should be good... no apology... manager Daodnhe knew there were worlds exchanged between myself and the server... as if I can't call him out on shitty service... I'm never going back to this location again.  If you have an idiot lazy server on a Saturday night don't expect to get good feedback...."
Jennifer L.,"Hesperia, CA",93,79,81,1.0,11/26/2016,"We ordered about 4 entrees and a couple of appetizers over the phone for pick-up and the lady taking the phone order was RUDE. For example, As I was ordering the ""avocado eggrolls"" the team member says with an obvious bad attitude, ""We have a lot of different kinds; so which one?"" she asks..... ummm you have a lot of different kinds of ""avocado"" eggrolls? Then she starts to name the eggrolls that the menu offers i.e. Summer eggrolls, southwest eggrolls etc.   (I think those were some of the options) Okay........so can I have the avocado one? She clearly wasn't listening attentively as I was placing my order. This wasn't a matter of bad communication or lack of cell service on my end. The employee was obviously moody and it left a bad taste in my mouth, literally. P.S. I used to love coming here, even though it's overpriced and super greasy, but no mas!"
Peter C.,"Riverside, CA",9,40,20,4.0,2/27/2017,"Food: The food here is great. I strongly recommend the Steak Diane. Steak is amazing plus caramelized onions and mushrooms just elevate it. Got chicken sandwich sliders which were great. The good thing is they have something for everyone. So if everyone is craving something different you can come here and it'll be fine. Obviously cheesecake is a must lol my personal favorite is the Reese's one. Can't go wrong there Service: I understand when people show up towards the end of your shift you can be tired but to be rude and inattentive isn't necessary. This happened on only one occasion but it stuck with me. Most other time I've had good service.  Ambiance: It can be whatever you want. Want a romantic night out, you can have it here. Want a casual feel? You can have that too. Perfect for any occasion  Overall: Good food, nice place. Just don't come late I guess. But overall I really like it here. You should enjoy your meal and time here."
Marie A.,"Riverside, CA",6,68,80,4.0,1/29/2017,"Don't typically come here because it's usually super busy. But! I *love* the tamale cakes. They are absolutely fantastic. Sweet, but not over powering. The sauce they use (totally forgot what it is) has a subtle kick to it that mixes well with the sweetness of the corn. I highly recommend trying it if you haven't yet!"
Jessica O.,"Moreno Valley, CA",6,125,1,4.0,6/17/2017,Place was nice but was a little bit busy.  Good food & good service.  Although one thing they could improve on is refilling your cups of water.
Juniper L.,"Downtown, Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,4.0,7/23/2017,"Friendly staff, food was delicious and I was impressed with the many dish options offered. The salmon is always fresh and flavorful."
Jack M.,"Moreno Valley, CA",0,1,,1.0,10/22/2017,"We had the worst experience with them, we waited almost 3 hours to get seated. They throw the bread on the table. They get many of our orders wrong and the manager delayed on coming to our table and a  waiter yelled at one of us. Never going there again"
Dee G.,"Mira Loma, CA",4,7,1,1.0,10/29/2016,"First let me say the wait staff is wonderful.  Other then that, go to Rancho Cucamonga to enjoy a good Cheesecake factory experience.  We ordered food and a kids meal. The brought all the adult food to the table but no food for the kids.  We waited for the kids food before we ate. When it didn't come my daughter gave the kids her food. The rest of the adult food had now gotten cold and we didn't eat it.  The kids meal came after the kids had ate my daughters food. She ate the kids food, which wf nie the only thing edible. Management was sorry.  Lol."
Michael D.,"Big Bear Lake, CA",61,3,,1.0,4/13/2017,"This place has horrible customer service. I've been here twice, (thought I'd give them a second chance), and the service is very slow, the waiters do not check on refills often, and the second time I came they could not get a medium rare stake cooked properly for a member of my party. If this place did not have good food I don't think they would be in business still today. If you want to go have dinner without headaches avoid this place like the plague."
Mike C.,"Corona, CA",2,1,,1.0,10/8/2017,Sunday late afternoon and it's a 1.5 hour wait. That's seriously crazy. The food is marginal at best. Just another trendy eatery. But my daughter wants to come here. -1 star if I could
Manwinder U.,"Riverside, CA",0,23,9,5.0,12/20/2016,"Honestly my friends and I had just had dinner and were craving dessert so we headed here. I'll say right now that you should leave space for the strawberry shortcake because it was the best I've had in a long time! We also ordered the chocolate cake and hot chocolates, 'twas a good night with good vibes and a funny waiter who wanted to join us lol."
Dacia M.,"Corona, CA",4,23,37,5.0,9/25/2016,"Came down as a closing to celebrating my wife's birthday weekend.  We were seated by the front hostess and attended to by Brandie L. This review is for Brandie L.  It was great service.  She was very attentive to our needs, food was served perfectly hot and fresh.  Drinks were refilled without having to ask.  Requests for extra bread service and sauce for our main dishes were quickly served.  It's hard to find good service such as what we experienced this evening, hence my positive review for her.  She made the evening a pleasant ending to a great weekend celebration.  Thank you Brandie L. For you friendly smile, hard work, and prompt service."
Sam U.,"Riverside, CA",2,61,4,5.0,6/18/2017,"I love this place the only bad part about it is the wait is too long .But what do you expect its cheesecake. They have the best barbecue chicken salad five star on that, and there service is pretty good."
Manuel O.,"Riverside, CA",16,1,,5.0,7/16/2017,I went in by myself and I really enjoyed my brunch thanks to their server Alicia a. I felt very taken care of. She was very nice and concerned with all my needs everything was great. Thank you
