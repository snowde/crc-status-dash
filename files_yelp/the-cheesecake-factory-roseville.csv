libby p.,"Citrus Heights, CA",39,10,10,5.0,1/3/2018,Soooo good . Service at the bar- for lunch Food excellent. Out of the crab cakes.. I ordered the potstickers.. good!  The beat salad is the best I've had! Highly recommend
Candace Y.,"Elk Grove, CA",83,395,486,4.0,12/22/2017,"While doing some Christmas shopping, we decided to grab a few appetizers as a light lunch /snack to refuel.  As you might expect, the shopping hordes were out in numbers, and there was a bit of a line. As we waited to be seated, I noticed a separate table set up to sell gift cards across from the cheesecake to go counter.   It looked like they were accommodating the extra traffic for to-go dessert products well. Once led to our table, I noticed the decor and the various glass light fixtures illuminating the space.  There were several sconce-style lamps that resembled the Eye of Sauron and a few that looked steam-punky with reddish-brown glass cones with black iron supports. (It's a pretty cool effect.).  We quickly picked three appetizers:  the Cubano, the samosa, and the mushroom plate.   While we waited for them to be prepared, we were pleased with the bread and plate of butter that was served to us.  The brown wheat bread was very good, and the sourdough was not bad.  The butter was soft enough to spread easily, I observed. The food came, and we dug in.  The small plates were pleasingly presented.   I was hungry enough to have to consciously slow myself down to taste and enjoy.   All three dishes were pretty good, albeit the Cubano was a tad on the oily side.  The mushrooms were savory with the seasonings.  The samosas came with a white sauce that went well with each crisp bite.   The service was good.  It was quick and courteous service.  I get the sense that this establishment has a good training program.  We'd been seated by one person, who subsequently introduced us to our server.   After the bread and the order-taking, there was a shift change, and we were introduced to the subsequent server.   We did not experience any lapse in service, which was a pleasant surprise.   I do believe that this enhanced our experience.  I will confess that I do not normally frequent large chain restaurants, but this dining experience was unexpectedly quite pleasant."
Doug G.,"Lincoln, CA",242,268,356,3.0,12/12/2017,"I had been doing some last minute holiday shopping at the Roseville Mall and decided to stop at the Cheesecake Factory for a light lunch. I had never been to this particular location. It was peak lunch time and the place was busy .... I mean really busy There was a line of folks waiting to be assigned and then ... subsequently shown to their tables. I opted for the bar and grabbed the first available bar stool. Looking around I could see that this was a typical Cheesecake Factory restaurant. Modern, classy look and feel and very good service. Why mess with a solid business model. I started with a Conn Creek Cabernet Sauvignon and ... a club soda to stay hydrated. Then, I ordered a cup of soup and a small green salad. The soup was a chili, lime, chicken tortilla and it was delicious. Chicken cubes in a rich broth, fresh lime juice, green onion, cilantro, cumin, red peppers and corn tortilla strips (and much more I can't identify). Generous serving. The green salad included lettuce and spinach. The tomatoes were a little too firm - not yet rip. The balsamic dressing was pretty good. All in all, a positive experience."
Kelly W.,"Los Angeles, CA",471,642,695,4.0,12/7/2017,"I've been in here a few times and it's a great location. Most of these restaurants are the same and this one is no exception, which isn't a bad thing. My friend and I have the same thing every time we come here. We start with the edamame and then we split the spicy cashew chicken. But the highlight of the meal is actually the cucumber lemonade. It's so refreshing. Everyone must try it at least once. Their bread is always fresh and warm. You have to be careful not to fill up on that first or you won't be able to finish your meal.  Their portions are huge so if you don't want leftovers, just split a meal with someone. Their service has always been great. If you're looking for a good meal this Cheesecake Factory won't disappoint."
Lily Z.,"Wakefield, MA",105,38,30,5.0,1/10/2018,Cheesecake factory is one of my go to for a nice meal. I'm from Boston and have just moved here - I have to say the male host that sat us is LITERALLY The nicest host I have ever encountered. I've been working in the Industry for 6 years and I'm impressed at the hospitality in this particular location!
mina g.,"Rohnert Park, CA",257,148,1110,5.0,10/8/2017,We take our granddaughter here every year for her birthday and she loves it! We all love it i gotta say there is plenty here to appreciate the consistency of the food its always delicious  we love ordering a bunch of different kinds of appetizers so we can have a little bit of everything and I like the fact that they have splits of champagne of Mums which is very good champagne and make gramma very happy because I'm about to trek alllllll over the again take mall that's there to find my Sophia her birthday presents  which will definitely wear me out so start out at Cheesecake Factory enjoy and relax before you tackle that mall we are never disappointed
Raymond G.,"Orangevale, CA",48,8,27,5.0,12/30/2017,Come on you guys if you never heard of cheese cake factory then there's something wrong with you already know it's good you already know it's delicious so what are you waiting for get off your couch and get your asses over here!
Sherri G.,"Rocky River, OH",60,132,137,5.0,10/15/2017,"I so appreciate this cheesecake factory location. The food is always fresh and the menu options so extensive that I can't fathom anyone not finding something they enjoy or are in the mood for on this menu. My difficulty is often deciding what to order. What I love most about this location is there ease of carry out. I travel to this area once a month and always find myself having at least one night where I just need to grab and go but do want typical fast food. Cheesecake factory makes take out a breeze. You can call ahead and have the option of coming in to pick up or you can drive up to one of their pick up parking spaces in the mall parking lot. they have four or five parking spaces allocated to drive up pick-up. All you have to do is call the phone number on the sign when you arrive and one of their cheerful staff will deliver the food right to your car.  Yesterday after a full day of weather related Airport flight delays I arrived into my hotel area after 11:30pm.  I was worried that my only option would be some 24 hour fast food chain. To my delight Cheesecake Factory was open until 12:30 AM. I ordered the Renee's  special which came with your choice of a chicken salad or club sandwich and soup or salad.  I chose the chicken salad sandwich which was served on a brioche toast and there soup which was a hearty baked potato, delicious. It really put a positive note on a difficult day. I would highly recommend if you are going to do carry out that you spend some time preparing by looking over their menu online, especially if you are adding in cheesecake which is always the end to a great meal."
Bryan D.,"Roseville, CA",42,45,96,4.0,10/8/2017,"Had a really good experience here last night. Place is always clean and the staff is very friendly. We were seated immediately in a booth. Our server was very friendly and came by multiple times to check on us. I went with the skinny chicken pasta and asked them to make it spicy. It was the perfect amount of spice and very tasty. My fiancé went with  the pasta special that had pepperoni, sausage, with a cream sauce over pasta. Everything tasted great and didn't take that long to come out. Out of everything our server did a phenomenal job."
Oday A.,"San Francisco, CA",1,7,5,5.0,10/22/2017,"This place is one of the best locations I've ever visited till now. The service is perfect. The food is awesome. Their menu is full of choices that you get confused to choose from. I can't complain about a thing.  I recommend this place for family gathering, special occasions and events."
King K.,"Folsom, CA",0,51,26,5.0,10/1/2017,Great food. The portion are big we could share 2 dishes between 3 people. Pastas are bomb must try.  Our group went overboard with drinks was fun.  Chicken pot pie is great not the normal pie in the pot. Though we have had a lot to eat already but WE COULD BOT LEAVE WITHOUT THE YUMMY cheese cakes. WARNING -- they are very heavy and filling ..
Colleen S.,"Fair Oaks, CA",83,87,4,3.0,12/31/2017,"The menu is extensive with many options. Our food was pretty good, nothing to write home about but enjoyable. Bit thin on flavor though. Husband had the chicken potstickers and the ""skinny"" chicken pot pie. I had the beet salad and the avocado toast. Service was friendly and efficient. What really irks me about this place is that my  martini was $14 and my husband's mojito was $13. Mind you, not top shelf alcohol. C'mon, that's completely outrageous for a cocktail at a chain restaurant and a complete ripoff! For that reason, I just can't give a strong endorsement."
Liana B.,"Sacramento, CA",231,266,965,5.0,2/3/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite chain restaurants ever. They have such an extensive menu that everyone can find something to their liking. Their delicious cheesecake is the cherry on top!  I've only been to this location once, but the service I received was wonderful! Our waitress, Lindsey, was so good to us! I ordered the green tea mint iced tea, which I ended up not liking. I asked to try the tropical iced tea at her suggestion, but I didn't care for it either. I didn't ask for it to be taken off my bill, nor did I expect it to be; but she didn't charge me for it, which I really appreciated. Great customer service!  My favorite things to order:  - fried portobello mushrooms, zucchini, and avocado - fried macaroni & cheese balls  - calamari  - sausage & ricotta flatbread  And if you really can't or don't find anything you like, just order a cheesecake!"
Steve C.,"Oakdale, CA",63,176,639,5.0,12/24/2017,"I only come for the cheesecake.  It's like any other Cheesecake Factory I been at, crowed, loud, and terrific food, but I love their cheesecake and coffee with it.  Come for the the cheesecake go home full."
Nicole B.,"Kloepfer Estates, Orangevale, CA",97,24,1,5.0,12/30/2017,"Our server was  !! Look at all this butter. Yuuuupppp the butter is where it's at. The long wait, the snotty people running into me while waiting, and the Crazyness was was all worth it for this beauty lol. When you ask for extra and they give you a cup full that's love. Remember butter = love. Get in my bbeelllaayyyyy!"
Donovan H.,"Citrus Heights, CA",298,320,1321,4.0,1/16/2017,"For those of you that have not dined at ""The Cheesecake Factory"", I must warn you that their menu book is about the size of a bible. And trying to find the perfect appetizer, entree, drink, and dessert can be way more of a tedious process than you might expect. To put it simple, they more or less have everything you're looking for; salads, sandwiches, burgers, seafood, chicken, steak, pizza, pasta, soup, breakfast food (during AM hours), well you get the picture. The location that I am focusing on is in Roseville and is more or less part of the Galleria shopping mall. Do keep in mind that parking here can be extremely difficult since the parking lot is shared with the mall shoppers. And it can get even more crowded if you plan on dining during dinner hours, weekends, and over the holiday shopping season. My lovely lady and I were very fortunate to grab a parking spot that was very close to the front entrance. And this just happened to have been on a Sunday afternoon around 5:00pm. The inside can describe several words; elaborate, gaudy, extravagant, and posh. It almost reminds me of being at a casino with the high ceilings, gold trim, and Tuscan artwork throughout. This particular location has a generous bar area, large tables for 10+ guests, and booths for smaller parties and couples. When my lady and I came, we put our names on a waiting list, told it would only take 15-20 minutes and received a buzzer. And they were good on their word as the buzzer did indeed go off in about 15 minutes. What makes the waiting part difficult is that there is no real sitting area except for a few small benches. Once we were seated, we were given menus and only a few minutes later, iced water with lemon wedges. Luckily we both knew what we wanted which helped simplify the whole process. I went with their ""Herb Crusted Filet of Salmon"" complete with a side of mashed potatoes and asparagus. She ordered their ""Steak Diane"" which also includes mashed potatoes as well as sauteed mushrooms and grilled onions. As for drinks, I went with a 22 oz. of their Racer 5 IPA while she had their Red Sangria. Our server was very friendly, had a good sense of humor, and made us feel right at home from the time we were seated until the time we left. And as busy as this place was, our food came out within only 15 minutes. Keep in mind, there must've been at least 200 guests dining here when we ate here so I am guessing they have a huge kitchen with at least 3 dozen chefs/cooks. As for our food, everything tasted good as what we had expected. My salmon had a nice seasoned flavor while the lemon sauce was a great addition. Her steak was seasoned very well as each medallion was tender yet there was quite an abundance of mushrooms on her plate.  Since we were both very full (this place is notorious for serving their guests hearty portions), we decided on ordering a slice of their cheesecake to-go. We both agreed on their ""Fresh Strawberry Cheesecake"". This included glazed strawberries with a few whipped cream puffs in our to-go box. When eating it at home, I do have to say that their cheesecake is one of the best I've tried and it's what they're known for, not to mention worth the extra calories. Overall, ""The Cheesecake Factory"" is and always will be a restaurant that has a little something for everyone. I do advice researching what you'd like to eat prior to coming in here to simplify the entire process. In the past, I have had many different food items and the quality of their food competes with restaurants such as ""BJ's Brewery"", ""Yard House"", and ""Outback Steakhouse"". Prices are competitive and if you're looking to save a few bucks, they do offer an excellent Happy Hour menu. Not to mention, a Sunday brunch for the weekend warriors. My rating for the Roseville ""Cheesecake Factory"", a respectable 4-stars."
Rachael G.,"Orangevale, CA",87,170,63,4.0,11/1/2017,"I honestly just come here for the drinks and cheese cake. Its my favorite thing, the crust to the cheese cake is amazing I just get chocolate or plain and its the best thing ever."
Eddie A.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,36,3,4.0,7/23/2017,I just had the club sandwich for lunch and it was delicious  love it.  The outside settings was nice as well.  EA
C C.,"Roseville, CA",0,23,30,3.0,11/13/2017,"11-11-17 sat 5:30 pm Well... it was ok.. very pricey!!!!! The drinks was half full for 13.00 margarita See the pic... food was ok.. Should have returned the drink!!! It was not worth $$13.00 It's was like a $5.00 I use to bartender so I know what a top shelf margarita should taste like and be presented well.. this was not... awful!!! Not for a high price drink.,.disappointed!!! Customer service wait staff was great that's why the 3 stars... Um... I don't usually eat at the mall Restaurant due to parking issue and high price in the Galleria area!!!! I would and should have gone to Tahoe Joes ! I didn't pick the place .. went for a birthday which they don't give a complimentary cheesecake anymore.. a small child's ice cream with chocolate   Thanks  Karen"
Mary W.,"Seaview, WA",0,8,,5.0,12/26/2017,"We went for lunch today and had a short wait even though the mall was crazy with after Christmas shoppers. Our waitress was very polite and attentive. My son and I love buffalo wings and these did not disappoint. In fact....my son said they were the best he's ever had. The salads were huge, too much to eat at one sitting. It was a delightful dining experience."
Liana I.,"Sacramento, CA",0,7,,5.0,11/15/2017,"Yes this place is absolutely great. Good lighting, beautiful, the food tastes amazing.. yummy yummy yummy  Very polite waiters, and will do everything to make you feel comfortable, welcome, and enjoy your stay."
Missy S.,"Roseville, CA",0,23,2,5.0,8/9/2017,"Our boss took our team to celebrate at The Cheesecake Factory! Our server was David ! What a great experience we had! Our server was extremely efficient. He knew exactly when the boys needed another beer! David was beyond a pleasure!  I had The Ribeye steak dinner, it was the best Ribeye I ever had! Our whole team said, ""We will always celebrate at The Cheesecake Factory! And we will always request David as our Server!"" Even though we were full, David had suggested a few great Cheesecakes! So of course we all had one or two to go! I chose Birthday Cake Cheesecake & Cherry Cheesecake! It sure was delicious!  Thank you Cheesecake Factory for the great food, spirits, desserts & stellar service!"
Chelli I.,"Stockton, CA",62,45,53,5.0,10/9/2017,"I absolutely love this location! (And I've been to many) I have never had a problem with them. Other than of course long waits, but that is out of their control for the most part. The food is always good and the service as well. Will keep coming back as long as I keep getting the great service they have been providing. I live an hour away and drive here with my fiancé a lot. Their cheesecakes are heavenly! Even if you don't have room for dessert, I recommend you take one slice to go and enjoy it later, you will not regret it. 5 stars from me (:"
Rian L.,"Granite Bay, CA",0,4,,5.0,12/18/2017,"This is one of my favorite restaurants, by far. My family has a tradition of spending my mom's and my birthday here every year and every year we are beyond thrilled. The food is great, and the waiters are always nice. Mike was our waiter and he was great, from great recommendations to being a funny uplifting guy to our night. 10/10 review."
Holly S.,"Sacramento, CA",432,157,350,3.0,3/30/2017,"When your looking for a modern restaurant, kid friendly but also for an intimate date ambience type of scenario, Cheesecake Factory is the place! There are soooo many items on the menu that everyone's cravings will be fulfilled, service was excellent, cleanliness of the store good & is right in the mall! The firecrackers were amazing! The Mac & cheese burger needs improvement, as far as cheese it was kinda runny like government cheese- The drinks were strong and appearance of the drinks were a plus! Cheese cakes and selections of cheese cakes/other cake options were endless. I definitely will be returning here options are a plus. Restrooms were super clean! Cheeseburger Mac and cheese tasted like government cheese!"
Caitlin V.,"Sacramento, CA",1,8,3,1.0,11/14/2017,All I wanted was a slice of cheesecake. Waited 10 minutes without a single employee acknowledging the small queue that had started around the display. I left before I could buy anything because I shouldn't and won't beg to spend my money.
Daniel C.,"Carmichael, CA",7,175,70,1.0,6/21/2017,"Tons of space in the bar, yet we've been kept waiting for ages. :( It is also really hot in here. They need to use the air conditioning in Sacramento Summer.  Our waiter is really nice, but that credit is for him alone, not for the restaurant."
Nikhil S.,"Folsom, CA",0,6,,1.0,12/17/2017,Came here with so much of excitement but it's all gone . We have been waiting for the waiter to take our order for sooooo long and she never comes over to take up the order.. all the tables are getting served and we are left with empty plates and no one taking care of us.. having a very bad experience right now. Never expected this from Cheesecake Factory. Should we consider this as ignorance or carelessness !!! We travelled 30 minutes to come here and waited 20 minutes for a table and now leaving with fulll dissappointment.. won't think about Cheesecake Factory again!!!!!
Jessica H.,"Davis, CA",11,26,12,3.0,9/23/2017,"There's a reason they don't call this the Pasta Factory. We ordered a Chicken Bellagio and Louisiana Chicken Pasta, both popular enough dishes to warrant copycat recipes on the internet.  The Louisiana Chicken Pasta is bow tie pasta (haven't had that since elementary school!) dotted with little slices of mushroom and red bell peppers topped with parmesan breaded chicken breast. The pasta itself was bland and the sauce lacked Cajun flair. The breaded chicken was delicious: tender and flavorful and dusted with cayenne pepper for an added kick. It saved what would otherwise have been a really lackluster dish. The Chicken Bellagio is basil pasta and cream sauce topped with breaded chicken (yay!) and arugula. Arugula itself is slightly bitter, and the dressing was just plain sour. Interesting combination. I felt like I was being punished with a healthy serving of greens before I was allowed to dig into the rest of the dish. Once again, the highlight of the dish was in it's breaded chicken: tender, delicious (but no cayenne pepper here). The pasta itself tastes like a bland rendition of pesto pasta. What does it matter if the basil is in the pasta or in the sauce? We topped off the evening with some Coffee and Creme Chocolate Supreme cheesecake. You know it was good because it rhymed and because well this is the Cheesecake Factory.  Overall, the experience was as expected and consistent with other Cheesecake Factory restaurants I'd been to in the past.  Special shoutout to our server, Jenna, for being super sweet and recommending the awesome dessert. If this review were for your service, alone, I'd be rating a hell of a lot more than 3 stars."
Joanne C.,"Sacramento, CA",57,28,10,2.0,9/19/2017,"Arrived last night around 7pm. There was a few people in the lobby waiting to be seated. We waited for a table for 6 people. We got seated fairly quickly. Our waiter took our drink order, delivered our drinks then gave us their delicious bread and butter! Shortly after we ordered our dinner. We ordered Tex mex egg rolls for an app. Our waiter came by shortly and said they were out of the egg rolls and if we wanted something else. So we decided on the taquitos. Shortly after that the manager comes by and she apologizes and says they are out of the mix and asked if we wanted something else. We went with the hot wings and she comped us for that. Which we appreciate!  Here's what bugged the crap out of me. The table to the left of us ordered 5 mins before we did. The table to the right of us had a different waiter who took their order 10 mins after we got seated.  Long story short both tables were served their dinner and ate, devoured their dinners while we were still waiting for ours. The table to the left actually ordered cheesecake and we still haven't been served our food!  Both parties were done eating while we sat there looking at each other!  Get it together cheesecake. We left there with a $120 dinner bill.  Next time we will just go up the street to BJs!"
Cheryl B.,"Roseville, CA",88,234,78,4.0,3/14/2017,"Yes, I know this is a chain...but this is the go to place for happy hour in our house.  One simple reason for this is variety.  I like Happy Hour after a hard day at work for some cheep eats and one of the few times I drink these days.  The cheesecake factory has lots of choices on their food menu for happy hour ....not the typical ""bar food"".  There are fried food choices if you must but they also have salads and flat bread pizza.  I also like that on a busy Friday lat afternoon we can almost always get seated before 6pm when HR is over and as you put your name down on a list you don't have to fight to get a seat.      Last time we went in we got a Asian cauliflower dish that was really great, plus nachos and mushrooms.  There are many different combos to try as well as yummy drinks.  You really can't go wrong. .....there is always cheesecake for desert."
Alena M.,"Citrus Heights, CA",33,63,208,2.0,5/11/2017,"Mediocrity at its best! That about sums it up for my experience at the Cheesecake Factory this last Monday night.  I'm not a big fan of chain restaurants to begin with and definitely not the restaurants that do it all. Mexican, Italian, Asian and so much more all packed into an enormous menu. You know that saying? Jack of all traits is a master of none, well this definitely confirmed that theory.. Came here for my husbands company dinner and left pretty disappointed. The biggest disappointment was the service, followed by the less than average meals provided.  Our waitress ( forgot her name) was just blah... not friendly or personable. No general knowledge of the menu or drinks and carried a smart ass kinda attitude.  My hubby wanted a Bloody Mary and asked how they were here ( not all Bloody Marys are created equal) , her answer "" ah I don't know, aren't they all the same? Never had one come back!"" Really?  That's the best you can do? What a turn off! Same snotty , unbecoming attitude continued throughout the evening and especially when it came time to splitting the bill. It took every good part of me to keep me from ripping her a new one. God knows, I'm trying to be a better person. We saw our waitress a total of 3 times through our entire night, once to take orders, one drink refill and to pay the bill. That's it's! Forget the "" do you need anything?"" The "" how's your food?"" Or "" would you like another martini?"" No where to be found.  Forgive the rant but when have people given up on service and stopped taking pride in their work? Since when doing just the bare minimum become sufficient?  Food was just ok, not good, not bad. Pretty to the eye but lacking in flavor. Over cooked pork chop and bland fish tacos bout sums it up. Edible but certainly not enjoyable. I had to pour hot sauce on my tacos for flavor for Christ's sake ! In all honesty I really wanted to give this place a 1 star review but the delicious dirty vodka martinis could not be ignored. By the way Cheesecake Factory, your Bloody Mary sucks! The entire experience needs improvement but probably will not return to see the difference."
Mary B.,"Yuba City, CA",6,9,4,5.0,10/21/2017,"Steak Diane!  The best!  Great service,  always seated right away, never a wait. ! Worth the trip for us!  We don't eat meat very often, so when we do, we come here!"
Becci H.,"Roseville, CA",27,105,76,1.0,4/15/2017,Are you kidding me?  Look at this? WTF is this?! Is the cook a rookie? Is the server blind? This is a NOPE NOPE NOPE!! (Please see my picture. Taken immediately after being put in front of me)
Paris M.,"Sacramento, CA",51,19,5,2.0,12/12/2017,"Came here to grab lunch very quick and boy did we regret it! First of all the girl at the entrance/front has a resting b face and doesn't smile or look like she wants to welcome you in! It wasn't busy so we got our table right away, waited a few mins and the waiter came to us and got our drink order, he brought us our drinks and didn't even ask if we were ready to order or not, so about 15-20 mins passes, he walks past us like 10 times without any interest if we are ready to order or not! At this point I was regretting not choosing a different place, and was thinking of leaving! Anyways he approached us and we ordered, and waited another 30 minutes to get our food, the food was okay, I'll give them an extra star for that but in general their customer service needs major changes! Also I was disturbed with the dinnerware and how it wasn't even clean and super old, you could see spots and, just didn't even look like they're well cleaned! Overall experience proved me not to ever waste my money and time here, total wait time came out to be 50-60 mins, very frustrating especially knowing it wasn't that busy!"
Jami N.,"Roseville, CA",415,400,416,5.0,7/29/2017,I love coming here they have the best food and I love the cheesecake Adams's peanut butter is my absolute favorite
Tom R.,"Loomis, CA",0,37,26,5.0,9/21/2017,Great service. The food is always very good. I tried the truffle honey chicken. Score. It was fantastic.
Aanchal G.,"Sacramento, CA",21,36,40,1.0,3/19/2017,"Went back here after two years of not having been even though I live 5 mins away from the location. Tonight me and hubby decided to have a late dinner since we caught a late show at the theatre and seeing how mostly everything closes early around the area we weren't left with much of a choice so we ventured into Cheesecake factory. We were seated right away. Our server was amazing. The food on the other hand was disgusting. I ordered the carne asada steak medallion and they over salted it and the rice was so dry I barely touched it. Also we ordered the chicken samosas for an app and they were over cooked.  Hubby had steak and he said it was tough meat. The price they charge you think they would improve the quality of their food. Only thing to rave about is their actual cheesecakes no matter what flavor, they are always delicious."
Tanya V.,"Antelope, CA",23,96,307,5.0,2/2/2017,This place is the best !!!!  To celebrate a birthday or just meet a friend for a cup of tea. I love their cheese cakes and also they prepare this tasty dish called herb  salmon !!!
Amanda T.,"Roseville, CA",0,19,4,4.0,1/25/2017,"I can't even lie, Cheesecake Factory is my favorite chain restaurant, ever! Even though their menu is HUGE, I always tend to order the same thing. I highly recommend the Skinnylicious Chicken Pasta if you are in the mood for some pasta, but also want to avoid those extra carbs and fat!  If I'm feeling lazy, I like to order my food with the app doordash.  **The reason I'm docking a star from my review is because I found the sticker from the avocado mixed in my guacamole appetizer!!! I'd appreciate it if the prep cook was more careful next time, but I also appreciate the integrity of Cheesecake Factory prepping their own guacamole from scratch, and not serving that fake stuff the comes pre-made in a bag!"
