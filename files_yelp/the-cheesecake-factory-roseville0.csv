Noy P.,"Roseville, CA",5,54,153,4.0,7/10/2015,Great place for any occasion.  Service can be a hit or miss.  Decors are nice and romantic.   Their complimentary bread is one of our favorites.   They have a small wine list and overpriced ---- you can get similar wines less $10-15 in other restaurants.
Jemal M.,"Sacramento, CA",0,9,,1.0,12/3/2016,"Ordering take out while black. So after shopping at the galleria I decide to go to the Cheesecake Factory to grab some cheesecake for me and my fiancé.  While waiting in line to order and a couple in front of me picks up their order and pays with a card and leaves. I order my food and the cashier gives me my total. I hand her my card and then she asked for my ID.  I was kinda shocked but not really. I showed her my ID and moved to the side so other customers can order. I then say to the cashier, "" you didn't ask the people before me for ID."" She basically lied to my face and said yes she did. I left it at that and took my order and left. Needless to say that will be the last time I spend my money at the Cheesecake Factory."
Cally A.,"Paradise, CA",126,23,29,4.0,8/22/2015,"Love this place! They've got good food and I enjoy the atmosphere. It's always a nice part of the shopping trip to The Westfield Galleria! I'd give five stars but they're on the expensive side for what you get, although the service is great and it is worth it at the end of the day. I recently bought my cousin there for her birthday and they don't offer anything at all for birthdays. It's just kind of bad for me for a place like that. But I'll still go back!!"
Hayley P.,"Davis, CA",99,19,9,3.0,1/6/2016,They're known for their cheesecake and they do deliver on their desserts.  The coffee is also pretty good.  Avoid their onion rings. In general they just aren't up to par.
Celeste B.,"Roseville, CA",0,9,,1.0,12/13/2016,"Ordered a carrot cake for a friend's birthday. Love this cake because it doesn't have raisins. The cake I got had raisins, dry! Very disappointing seeing as I could have gone to local grocery chain and gotten something moist without raisins and fresh. Won't buy again! Yuck"
Timm S.,"Roseville, CA",0,3,,5.0,6/12/2017,pasta napolitana - to die for!  i hope they keep it on the menu......hard to believe i had something this good at a major chain restaurant......
Billy A.,"Sacramento, CA",31,141,205,5.0,9/6/2015,"My husband brother and a friend of ours had dinner here last night and we ordered the the amazing salon and chipotle pasta, as usual it was delicious but the presentation was far note impressive than the standard.  Because we live in Midtown,we typically dine at the Arden location, but decided to eat in Roseville after leaving the galleria mall. But it wasn't just the cooked to perfection dish that pushed me to write this review it was Jessica! Apparently she is a new hire (waitress) let me say, she could have fooled me. She was the most interactive and pleasant waitress EVER! I would even go as far as saying if I owned a restaurant, I would take her!  Sometimes the positive energy and outstanding service makes all the world of a difference.  The manager on duty was also a delightful gentleman, he was very down to earth and friendly. So next time we are craving something from cheesecake you can bet we will make the extra drive to visit this location and hopeful we will have the wonder Jessica as our waitress! ;)"
Christina H.,"Roseville, CA",55,14,37,4.0,9/22/2015,"Very good food.  Service started out not so good, but ended great in the end.  My meal was AMAZING!"
Tatiana H.,"Sacramento, CA",0,6,,1.0,5/18/2016,"I visited here a handful of times and my experiences have always been okay. Nothing outstanding. Service was mediocre and same for the food. However on my latest visit (which was actually a while ago probably back in April, I'm just getting to this review now) I had the worst visit.  I arrived with a party of four during lunch rush and waited 20 minutes in an overcrowded waiting area to be seated. We were seated awkwardly in the middle of two other parties. we ended up being here for three hours simply because our server Austin neglected us the entire time and took exceedingly long to bring us our food. My friend ordered the mushroom burger without the beef because she is a vegetarian and he said ok got it! Next thing you know he brings a burger with beef in it, after everyone around us who ordered after us already got there food, and we had to send it back. When we tried to get our check so we could leave he completely ignored us and did not even ask if we wanted desert. We had to tell him ourselves. The couple next to us even noticed how poorly he was treating us and said that we were doing the right thing being nice because maybe he is just having a bad day. If that's the case maybe he should choose a different profession? Also, The garlic noodles were the worst I ever had! My friend couldn't even eat any of the cheesecake because they all contained gelatin! And the last time we were here our server told us some cheesecakes did not contain gelatin?! Anyways sorry for the long rant, basically what I am trying to say is that Cheesecake Factory sucks. It you enjoy mediocrity go for it!"
Boho C.,"Fremont, CA",0,2,2,4.0,9/17/2015,Food was great.  I ordered Cajun jambalaya with penne pasta and it was spicy and delicious.  Only 4 star because I waited about 30 minutes for my food good thing they gave us bread.  Kent our server was nice.
Jenny L.,"Sacramento, CA",53,43,111,4.0,5/4/2015,"This Carolina BBQ pulled pork sandwich just gave me a foodgasm! The crunchiness of the bacon and coleslaw, the moist and tender, sweet and savory of the pulled pork made my mouth water. The sandwich came out hot and perfect. The wheat bread with the butter were fresh and yummy!! Nicole was very sweet and attentive!! 5 star customer service!"
Jordan A.,"Sacramento, CA",4,45,6,4.0,7/7/2015,"I am a HUGE fan of the skinnylicious menu at the Cheesecake Factory. At this location, you can typically get in at the bar without a wait. Their happy hour menu is awesome and contains a few of the items also featured on the skinnylicious menu.  I'm not necessarily trying to cut the calories when I eat somewhere like this, but it helps just to keep the menu digestible. The regular menu is huge and I tend to get overwhelmed.  Also, I can't go here without ordering a strawberry martini - just saying!!"
Martha M.,"Roseville, CA",0,6,1,5.0,12/18/2016,"Whenever someone asks where I wanna eat I always say Cheesecake Factory! Never had bad service and have been going here since they opened. The portions are pretty big, so I would recommend to save some dinner in a box so you can enjoy that amazing cheesecake!"
Oscar N.,"Roseville, CA",0,3,,5.0,12/9/2016,Best food ever eaten love the service the place is clean and nice . I love to go there every weekend
Sabrina C.,"Rocklin, CA",0,14,,5.0,2/4/2017,"Great place for either a small party or large gathering.  My daughter celebrated her 15th birthday party here and invited about 15 girls for lunch. They do not take reservations, but we were able to put our name down for a table about an hour before the party started.  The staff was very accommodating and put several small tables together in one area to fit our group. We were able to order off the lunch menu still since the party started around 4:00 pm. They allowed us to bring our own cake too. If you slice the cake yourself, there is no slicing fee. They did not rush our party and the service was fabulous with the server checking to refill waters often.  The staff even came over to sing to my daughter. Very nice !!  And when were leaving, I needed a better box to take the remainder of the cake home, and they kindly escorted me to the bakery section and provided me with one of their very nice bakery boxes! We will back Cheesecake Factory as you delivered  great food with exceptional service :) Thank you !!"
Llll G.,"Chico, CA",1,53,,5.0,10/8/2016,"Lettuce wraps were wonderful. So was cucumber ice tea !! Pumpkin cheesecake was delicious! Service was great. Restaurant is comfortable. Happy me, we will go back."
Sherrod S.,"Roseville, CA",8,8,19,4.0,3/25/2016,Every extensive menu that should please most palates if not all. I had the chicken avocado sandwich which was very large and tasty. A word to the wise - the decor is somewhat garish - but don't draw a correlation between the decor and the quality of the food which is very good.
Geoff M.,"West Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",79,344,946,4.0,4/3/2014,"The cheesecake factory is always good!  If you cant find something that you want to eat on that menu- then just stay home!  The menu is huge, the food is good and the cheesecake is amazing!   As far as this location went it was a nice restaurant.  The décor was nice and the service was good.  The only knock on it was that they were out of a couple things, but it was late a night on a Friday."
Az C.,"Rocklin, CA",0,3,1,5.0,10/4/2015,Had the best service. Edgar.G was amazing. Great personality. Checked on us made sure our drinks were filled and to check on us to see if we needed anything.  BTW the breakfast was perfect there fresh and delishes. Never had breakfast there.
Rob E.,"Rocklin, CA",22,36,29,5.0,3/7/2015,"Not much to say here... I mean it's THE Cheesecake Factory. Love their Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp.  And it's Original Cheesecake for me.  Service is good. Ask for Jen, she's the best server!"
