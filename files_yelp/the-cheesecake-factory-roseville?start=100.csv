Marcus M.,"Folsom, CA",403,266,399,1.0,1/14/2016,"My first time visiting this location and after I ate my meal and left the establishment I felt kind of bamboozled! My total check was 95 something dollars...for two people which is usually the norm for a hungry alcohol consumer like myself. The reason I felt that way was for three reasons: 1. The chicken patty to my spicy chicken sandwich was small and very chewy at the ends 2. Our waiter hardly came by even tho she had to know we were gunna be spending a bit of a chunk of change for a 2 people party 3. Our mixed alcohol drinks (Hennessy and Coke and mojito), numerous of them tasted very watered down and like the alcohol was non existent! This trip was a waste of $95! As a X fan of Cheesecake Factor im here to say shame on you Cheesecake Factory!"
Claire T.,"Fair Oaks, CA",0,3,,5.0,9/24/2017,Our server Nagawa was amazing! She was always on it and she gave us a great experience. The nachos are so yummy and a perfect appetizer to share. The Reese's peanut butter cheesecake is the best as well. We will definitely be back. Thank you Nagawa! :)
Karen O.,"Antelope, CA",0,17,1,5.0,6/3/2017,Wow this place has the best food friendly and fast service will be going again thanks you!
Regina A.,"Folsom, CA",0,8,,1.0,6/2/2017,A friend of my loves the Cheesecake Factory. So I went there today at 4pm to purchase a gift card . I approached the podium and asked if I could purchase a gift card. The hostess at the counter who I later found out was the manager ( Jennifer March) never looked in my direction or ever greeted me in any fashion. But said we will be with you. I approached a second hostess station and was told by other employees that I needed to go back to the first station to purchase a gift card. I told the employees at the counter that I felt Jenifer was rude and showed a bad example of customer service. I requested her business card. At first they didn't want to give my her business card but after I insisted on getting their names they gave me what I asked for. Overall worst example ever.
Rachael S.,"Foresthill, CA",0,3,,1.0,5/28/2017,"Normally we LOVE Cheesecake Factory...tonight was a TOTAL fail! Firstly it took over 40 min to get our meals. We were never talked to or apologized for how long it was taking. Then all 3 of our families had messed up orders. Wrongs Salads, food given to other people, kids meals without fruit,  burgers with no cheese and 2 bottom buns. I'm sorry but when your paying $15 for a burger this is unacceptable.  To top things off a plate was dropped on my 11 year old nieces back and broke. Finally the manager apologized. To little to late.   Offering for 3 families of 12 people to share a slice of cheesecake when you had to come 4 times and we waited over half hour.  Needless to say I will think twice about spending $15 per person for this kind of service. I could not believe when we received our bills and NOTHING was taken off.  Very bad service very bad management."
John94521 H.,"Concord, CA",7,39,,3.0,5/2/2017,"Read the menu before you go, unless you pick and choose on the spur of the moment. I read the menu and saw chicken and waffles (God, I Love chicken and waffle with syrup and gravy). We got to the restaurant and ordered Caramel Royale Macchiatos and chicken and waffles. ""Sorry sir, we only serve chicken and waffles on Sunday"". Wow, now I all bummer out and take a shot at something else on the menu. Ho Hum. . . back to 2 eggs w/potatoes and toast with a hamburger patty. The Caramel Royale Macchiatos came and you couldn't pick up the mug because it was too hot and the liquid was to the top rim of the mug. Spill factor. . . Alexa S. was very apologetic and helped with napkins and straws. . .The drink was good after it simmered down to temperature. Everything else was OK. . ."
Joseph K.,"Rocklin, CA",6,27,4,1.0,8/9/2017,"This is by far the most disappointing experience i've ever had at the Cheesecake Factory. I told the waitress I had celiac and that I needed the steak to be gluten free. She responded back with A lot of attitude. When I asked her if the meat would have a nice char on the outside if I ordered it medium and she responded ""no"". So I then ordered it medium well. There was absolutely no pink in it. It was like they left the steak out to die. Dried out and burnt to a crisp..disgusting. On top of the service and food being terrible. My stomach was in absolute pain after the meal. I would NOT recommend this place to anyone, especially people with celiac or food allergies. I can't think of one good thing that came out of this experience. In the past I've always had a great experience with the servers but this was comparable to visiting a restaurant in hell. Maybe they were really desperate in the hiring process. Just avoid this place. You'll be happy you did."
Dianna G.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,18,,5.0,11/16/2017,"Dined here this past Sunday and the entire experience was ""fabulous"".  We were seated promptly and our waitrees, Julie K, was attentive, courteous, and impressive the entire visit.  We each had special requests on our lunch order and Julie K made sure things were delivered as requested.  She took our order by memory, but what stood out, is her ability to also capture the ""special requests that went with the orders"".  The grilled salmon that I had - well, it was amazing in every way. The bread, the iced teas, the entire meals, etc., we enjoyed!  We find the Cheesecake Factory is always busy and a popular destination - that is why I also gave the visit 5 stars as on the occasions when they are super crowded, the front line staff keep in touch with those waiting, making every effort to get the folks seated asap.  My only negative which I did not include as part of this rating - -  is that they are the only restaurant chain that I have dined at that ""does not place their utensils on a napkin"" - the utensils are always placed directly on the table. Very unsanitary, but I will not expound on the numerous reasons as to why."
Aimee K.,"Newport News, VA",56,90,34,4.0,8/13/2016,The food is so good. But wtf!?! It's so expensive!! My boyfriend and I went for our anniversary . Our bill was 100 plus tip. The food is awesome . The service is good too.
Sam W.,"Citrus Heights, CA",86,1,,1.0,4/13/2017,Dear cheesecake factory specifically this location.  I spent over a hundred dollars on my meal and this was one of the worst experiences I have ever had.  Not only is the customer service staff not very warming or considerate but the chefs that prepared my food may need to go back to culinary school.  I will be asking for my money back and probably putting this experience in my magazine.
Jax J.,"Roseville, CA",0,5,,5.0,4/13/2017,"I love this location, the restaurant is absolutely beautiful and the food is so good!! I am a sucker for cheesecake and some of the choices you guys have make my mouth water!! I can also appreciate that every time I come I get the same quality of food ( I love knowing what to expect!) David is the server we ask for since we've been coming here for years, he is so attentive to our kids and he's friendly! Any questions we have in regards to food items or even menu prices David knows it all! I also like to see the manager walking around talking with some of the other tables it's a nice way to show your customers you care! A++++ to David & Cheesecake Factory you guys rock!!"
Joe O.,"Roseville, CA",17,24,16,4.0,10/29/2016,Went there for happy hour I had some very good food and I would have to say the gal who is our waiter was probably one of the best servers I've had in years! She was very kind and courteous attentive friendly and outgoing! Well done! My wife and I had a wonderful time!!!
Don M.,"Indianapolis, IN",10,2,,1.0,4/8/2017,"Supposedly their signature dish. Disgusting and undercooked chicken. Won't be back beware, cooks are getting worse by the day"
Laura B.,"Redding, CA",30,19,,5.0,2/10/2017,"This place is delicious, Thai lettuce wraps & avacado eggrolls are superb. I have been here a few times when visiting family, I always have a great experience & awesome tasting dishes never let down yum"
G H.,"Arroyo Grande, CA",1,29,1,3.0,7/29/2017,"Stopped by on a Thursday evening.  Great service great food. Good thing we were traveling, so I had my jacket in the van.  Had to get it out because it was FREEZING in the restaurant.  So cold I could not stand it.  Had I been able to get to my pants in the luggage I would have. :-)"

Jay M.,"Galt, CA",19,61,,5.0,5/18/2017,"Had lunch today, had the skinnylicious chicken enchildas. Everything was tasted good, lots of flavor. Ordered cheesecake to go. My server Travis B was very pleasant, service was excellent."
Johanne R.,"Loomis, CA",4,10,,2.0,7/28/2017,Ordered our favorite meal (gumbo) the sauce was like water and not the usual cream sauce..decided to take home leftover and discovered discovered all the meat and new sauce was not included just rice...what a disappointment (3 leftovers and 3 containers with only part of the leftovers included) pretty expensive bad experience!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Josh N.,"Folsom, CA",611,1292,568,3.0,3/29/2016,"Sweet old Uncle Milton gave us a gift card to this joint so off to the Cheesecake Factory we went. I have visited their location in Arden Arcade a handful of times for work meetings and I have always had a decent experience. TCF is a odd duck to me, the restaurants are quite beautifully adorned but the patrons are generally casually dressed. The food is typical chain restaurant ""menu for every taste"" yet is expensive for what you get. The menu touts fresh proteins and local sourced produce when available, which is not common to chain restaurants. Fresh food is commendable but when your menu is exactly 714 pages long execution can become a problem. I ordered the ""Roadside Sliders"". Noted hamburger aficionado George Motz wrote an article recently touting the Roadside Sliders as one of the better examples you can get. I don't disagree with his assessment as all the ingredients are there: white squishy bun, fresh beef, onion and pickle (and for some reason ketchup, I held the ketchup). The problem lies with the aforementioned 714 page menu. How can you cook everything properly when you have so much to do? The answer in my entree was you can't. The beef was overcooked, the onions were beyond charred and I had to steal some of the daughter's ketchup (shame!!!) to tackle the dryness. That being said the server was given back a clean plate. I couldn't leave without a slice of cheesecake. I ordered the ""Original"". Tremendously delicious!! Graham Cracker Crust, creamy sour cream filling and whip cream to round it out. It is tough to beat. In closing, disappointing entree and phenomenal dessert. That is one fat man's opinion."
