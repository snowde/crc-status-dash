Christy C.,"Folsom, CA",0,16,4,1.0,7/27/2017,"I would put no stars if I could, the management should be fired for the way they handled a major health threat at their restaurant today. An elderly gentlemen had an accident and there was feces everywhere being leaked from the man as he walked to get out of the restaurant. There was feces everywhere  in the front lobby and the staff did not stop people from coming into the restaurant while they cleaned it up, instead they left it up to those of us in the waiting area to warn people walking in not to step in the poop all over the ground or drag their bags from shopping in it, then they started to clean it with no gloves on, using linen napkins and a spray bottle of something that had no smell (should have been cleaned with bleach), they only used a mop on the main area where most of the feces was, they did not mop the trail of feces that was tracked through the restaurant, instead they used the linen napkins (that they will probably wash and use again for customers), there was no managers or anyone helping, they did not put up any wet floor signs at the least to warn that there was a problem, the two managers seemed to be totally oblivious to what was going on, standing behind the hostess station just talking and laughing to themselves, not helping in anyway, not stopping people from coming in, not talking to those of us that were there and witnessed it and were trying to help stop people from walking in it, the managers had no idea if this man had Hepatitis or some other disease and now there is his feces all over the restaurant and everyone working there acts like they have no idea how to stop people for a few minutes from walking in it while they clean, then they have no idea how to clean, disgusting, I will never be able to eat here again!"
Noel P.,"Roseville, CA",147,169,573,5.0,6/4/2015,Went again last night for my birthday dinner with a group. One small complaint - the service for bar drinks was incredibly slow. No reason why - as it was a Wednesday night and the place wasn't packed.  This being said - I only ordered one - the Tropical Martini and it was very good!  Would have ordered more - but didn't want to wait. I ordered the Combo - Steak Diane with Herb Crusted Salmon.  It was just what I wanted and it was really delish.  Underneath the salmon was some very fresh and perfectly cooked asparagus with a lemony sauce - it paired perfectly with the salmon. I was really happy with the mushrooms that came with the steak and the sauce was very yummy! For dessert I ordered their Lemon Meringue cheesecake - it's new and it was really good.  Had great lemony (tart) flavor to accent the creamy sweetness of the cheesecake. Best thing about it? It wasn't on a graham cracker crust - can't stand those!!   Once again - Cheesecake Factory you exceeded my expectations and provided a really nice birthday party for myself and guests!!
Albert A.,"Vallejo, CA",121,28,10,5.0,1/17/2017,Always stop by during my travels and it never fails to satisfy my cravings. The food is super good. My fave is the Hibachi Steak.
Beth L.,"Rocklin, CA",6,124,,1.0,1/17/2017,"Pretty sad. I called an hour before they opened to see if their patio was open and if it accepted dogs. The answer was yes. I came in at 11:11 am and tried to get a patio seat to which they replied the patio is not open and only service animals are allowed. Now I don't mind if pets are allowed or not but please don't let me drive all the way over to find out both things told to me were incorrect.  Fyi to anyone reading this, dogs are not allowed unless they are service pets. Even they tell you over the phone that they are, they aren't. Not cool cheesecake factory not cool"
Claudia P.,"Roseville, CA",0,6,,2.0,1/29/2017,"Firstly, I'd just like to say that this review only received 2 stars because our waitress, Nicole, was so polite and courteous to us during our horrible visit that she deserved the recognition and extra star. But the restaurant itself deserves zero stars, but it received one since that's not a possibility.  We arrived at 4:50 on a Saturday night, expecting some sort of wait since it was a Saturday and Saturdays are typically busy nights and the Cheesecake Factory is always busy. We were told 40 minutes and we're seated by 5:30, so no issues there. We were then told that new menu additions had been added tonight to test out and were shown a new, additional menu with around 10 new items. We thought nothing of it at the time but you'll soon learn why this was an issue. We had placed our order at around 5:45 and by the time 6:40 had rolled around we still had not received our meals and the manager came over to tell us the kitchen had backed up and our meals would be out in a minute. 15 minutes later our meals finally arrived,  about on hour after we had ordered them.  Mine as well as my Dad's arrived cold and my mom's arrived wrong as well as burnt. The manager offered to fix my mom's meal but she simply made do because she didn't want to wait another hour. The waitress (a different one as Nicole had gone on break) offered to take mine back and get a new plate but by the time she came around I was already halfway done and didn't want to wait any longer. Thankfully, the comped my meal and gave us free cheesecake which was generous and we were thankful for that. But the experience didn't end there.  After we had finished eating we spent another 30-45 minutes simply just waiting to check out. This was due to the fact the the Break waitress had run the wrong table and had to go through and cancel everything to redo it. Nicole was very straight up with us when she came backs as well as apologetic for what had happened, even stating how bad she felt and we appreciated the honesty but truthfully we were anxious to get out as our dinner experience had already lasted 2 hours.  Word to the wise Cheesecake Factory: Don't test 10 additional menu items on the busiest night of the week. The kitchen can't handle it, it stresses out and causes a multitude of problems for managers and waiters/waitresses and makes really unhappy customers. I know for a fact that we were not the only table that the manager had to come to for a problem, so I'm sure that my family as well as others had a very long and unhappy Saturday night dinner all thanks to the Cheesecake Factory."
Francine B.,"Citrus Heights, CA",131,228,338,4.0,4/22/2016,"Enjoyed a nice lunch with my friend today. It was busy but we were seated in about ten minutes. The waitress was very nice and attentive. We both ordered the lunch size portion of the chipotle chicken pasta which was still huge! It was delicious with asparagus, shallots and bell peppers. I really enjoyed the passion teas as well. We were to full for dessert but I have had the cheesecake in the past and boy are they decadent! The avocado egg rolls are my favorite appetizers. They are crunchy deliciousness with an amazing sauce. This is a great place if you have picky eaters because the menu is more like a book and guaranteed to have something everyone likes. The only thing was our table for two was so close to the next table we actually started talking to each other!!"
Karishma M.,"Folsom, CA",2,18,1,1.0,1/6/2017,Had gone here for the first time. Good ambience and good service. But the food was so bad that didn't even feel like eating although I had nothing for lunch and we had gone for dinner. We ordered the egg roll sampler very good presentation but too oily. But their most famous steak Diane was no taste but just black pepper. I couldn't even taste the steak. It was almost like I was eating black pepper. Never coming back!!!
Angela S.,"Roseville, CA",22,44,1,3.0,1/2/2017,"Decided to grab dinner with my husband before shopping. We got a booth right away which was great! Our waitress though made us so uncomfortable. I asked her how her day was going and she sighed and said ""decent."" but seemed annoyed. Any request after that just seemed like a burden, which I kind of understood later was just her personality. I was nervous to order with changes because I thought I'd get another annoyed response. Thankfully halfway through a new waitress came over saying she was taking over and was amazing otherwise I wouldn't give 3 stars. Water was prompt, food was amazing, I was finally able to relax and enjoy myself without worrying the waitress was upset with any drink orders we made."
Lara Y.,"Valley Springs, CA",0,10,3,1.0,7/4/2017,"Worst meal ever at a chain restaurant! Ever. Plus they sat a ""service dog"" next to us that was in training and panted in my direction the whole time. Disgusting. Server was fine, but food was terrible! Dry mashed potatoes, soggy ""crispy"" chicken, hard dry asparagus. Gross. Dogs wouldn't eat this."
Jeremy T.,"Granite Bay, CA",55,112,1225,3.0,4/21/2016,"Service 8s normal. Live thee bang bang chicken and shrimp, only complaint is not enough sauce, which I correctly by asking for more sauce on the side. Appetizers are a good way to go if you can't  decide but you need at least 2 ppl to do it otherwise it is expensive. Make sure you ask no rice noodles when you do the lettuce wraps."
Claudia L.,"Citrus Heights, CA",0,1,,4.0,7/25/2017,"We came here for Happy Hour, Shiloh was our server. Got  wonderful service anticipated our needs, informative, good knowledge of the menu. Took great care of us. And because of him we will return."
Naomi C.,"Sacramento, CA",85,49,15,1.0,3/18/2016,"Oh my goodness. Where can I even begin?? Horrible horrible horrible. Please save your money and never come here. I ordered the miso salmon because it's usually super delicious! Well this time I went to the cheesecake in Roseville instead of the one on Arden, but it was a horrible mistake, well I ordered the miso and once it came I started eating it, after a few bites in it tasted super fishy, so I pull it apart and realize it's so disgusting and raw, so undercooked it was disgusting! I can't believe they actually served that nasty under cooked fish, it was so gross and slimy!!! When I let the waitress know she asked if she wanted the cooks to recook it for me, what the heck! Why in the world would I want that?! Long story short the supervisor on the shift came and apologized and offered me a free desert! How pathetic! I'm never going to any cheesecake again!!"
Robby Christine S.,"Wailuku, HI",0,25,,5.0,7/30/2016,"what's to say!  the name says it all....the service is always great! Good eats! and, of coarse, save room for the cheese cake, that is why you are there....right? lol! the 30th anniversary cheesecake is to die for, but then again, so are the other flavors... half off cheesecake July 29/30th"
roy p.,"Sacramento, CA",0,30,2,1.0,6/29/2016,Disgusting can you believe that a mohito costs 12.95 here each and on top of that they give u wilted mint thats black. allegedly the manager says is fresh every morning. Again does this look fresh we eat mint on a daily basis.
Lily D.,"Roseville, CA",78,451,1209,2.0,7/30/2015,Food good but service is not and where the low stars come from. I have only been to this location once about 5 years ago.  Its just a not a place I think about going.  I had been with friends but my husband had not so we agreed to go.  It is a little smaller than the one on Arden.  We walk in for late lunch around 230 on Wednesday.  Little did know it was cheesecake day and all slices were half off as I saw on the flyer at the counter.  Not ONE employee ever told me about it.   We had walked in with another group and the hostess was a little confused who to help so I politely tell her that they were first so she takes them to her seat and we view the dessert case trying to make our cheesecake selection in the meantime.  I turn around and she is helping/seating the new people who just walked in.  Hello???  Our server came and got our initial drink and food order in a good amount of time but went down hill from there.  I ordered the Parmesan crusted chicken as I remembered really liking it.  Husband got avocado rolls which for a meal left me unsatisfied but was actually tasty.  My dish was not as good as a I remembered.  Noodles were a little too al dente and not as flavorful?   Waitress was inattentive. Checked on us once about 3 minutes after our food delivered and I had not taken a bite yet. Then nothing.  Our drinks were bone dry and we were about to get up and get refills ourselves at the drink station that was so teasingly close to our table when she finally came.  I told her we both made sure to leave room for dessert!  so she asked if we'd like a dessert menu.  Yes please!  Their desserts are very expensive.  EVERYTHING is $7 minimum.  They wanted $6.95 for a bowl of fresh strawberries.  Are you kidding me??? and $7.95 for a hot fudge sundae.  A cheese cake slice is $7-8 in which I can accept but still so pricey if you figure on a table of 6 would add another $42 to the bill.  Thank goodness for being half off day.  We decided what we wanted and waited.  And waited.  And waited 10+ minutes before she came by to take our dessert order.  The wait was so long that it didn't sound good anymore and the wait was not worth it as we had things to do.   As for the survey for your $10 egift card.  Be wary.  It asks for your name/address/phone/email and not a whole lot about your visit.  Two questions exactly.  Seems like a phishing expedition on their part even though there is a whole one page disclaimer but I think that is why they do it. I have never seen such a long in depth disclaimer in my life for a survey!  Overall I was very disappointed in this visit.  Service was terrible.  Food was not outstanding.  I couldn't even try their infamous cheesecake.  Looks like another 5 years before I return to this location.  There are just too many good places to eat in Roseville now to want to come back.  Plus I am not a huge cheesecake fan.  I like it but don't love it.
Charles C.,"South San Francisco, CA",0,6,,2.0,7/11/2017,"It's been awhile since we've been back here, and technically we didn't even stay to get in.  Basically we were informed that it was a 15 minute wait to be seated.  However during that same time period at lease 5 plus groups went in, at least 3 after we asked to be seated.  This was because they were 3 people or less.  If the restaurant wasn't half empty wouldn't even mention it, but since it was largely empty it didn't quite make sense that they could accommodate the same or more number of people, but only in smaller groups.  We were seating 5 people."
Susan F.,"Granite Bay, CA",0,6,,5.0,7/6/2017,We love this place! Not only is the food & service a phenom but we are so lucky to have such great rapport with Natalie & 1 of the managers Jen! They make our visits the best.....you guys are lucky to have both of them working for you!!!
Claudy H.,"Carson City, NV",156,394,5247,5.0,6/21/2014,"I am a fan of cheesecake factory. Always going down to Roseville Galleria Mall just for cheesecake. My fav is pretzel chicken, fish and chips and of course some cheesecake to go such as the hershey and original / strawberry cheesecake.  The staff is always friendly, and because this location at the  mall, sometimes if you reach around lunch time on weekend, you've to wait for a bit while I am so excited to wait they are gonna open in Reno, woott woottt"
Kate F.,"Rocklin, CA",89,73,111,4.0,2/7/2015,"You can't go wrong with Cheesecake Factory!  Took the family on a late Friday night during a big storm.  Was a bit surprised by the wait, but honestly there is always a wait.  The high top tables in the bar area are open seating. The menu is lengthy (16+ pages) with options ranging from small plates to appetizers to entrees.  The even have a ""skinny menu.""  Options range from fish to chicken to pasta to burgers.  Full bar and the cocktails are great!  And then, of course, there is the cheesecake which has it's own menu due to the large list of  selections...original, Oreo, Key Lime, Mango, Strawberry, and my favorite Raspberry-Lemon. Overall, a wonderful meal and Mike was an attentive and fun server.  He helped make the night what it was! We will be back - thank you for a great family evening!"
Terrance B.,"Rocklin, CA",0,18,9,4.0,12/28/2016,The food was excellent although I asked for my sliders well done they came out medium but I'm one that can still eat it that way lol none the less tasted great. Service was good. Not sure why the galleria cheesecake doesn't come up in yelp I added it so hope they review it and add it so people can easily leave reviews.
