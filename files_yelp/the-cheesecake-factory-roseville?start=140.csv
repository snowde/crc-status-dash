Jill B.,"El Dorado Hills, CA",217,10,4,2.0,6/29/2017,"I am giving two stars because of the ""start"" of my experience at the restaurant today. I have worked in the food industry for 15 years and I was shocked the way I was greeted when my daughter and I walked in. The hostess department did not smile when we walked up or greeted us. They were very rude, and they acted as if they didn't like their customers nor their job. Not one time during my lunch did I see them smile or act accommodating towards the guests. The only reason I stayed for my lunch was because of our server, Kadie. She was very sweet, very attentive and personable. I want to say thank you to her for making our lunch a better experience. We will not go back to this location as the hostess department needs to work on their hospitality."
Kim N.,"South Bay, CA",2945,9796,55587,4.0,3/23/2015,Coming through the area it's hard to find eats at 10.30pm on a Sunday. After finding the kitchen to be closed at another open place we said screw it and headed here. It's been a while since id been to one but you know ive actually always liked them. People diss the whole chain thing but theyre amazingly consistent if you like their food. Shrimp scampi and a bbq burger were out late night eats. Also started with the fried calamari which was cooked perfectly. How many places have i gone where the squid is over and rubbery? I shudder to think. They were spot on. Same with the burger mid rare. Scampi is what i remembered and when we were done we were stuffed. Our server took good care of us and we could go into the night not starving. No complaints of chain here
Kenny L.,"San Francisco, CA",449,240,323,4.0,2/16/2015,"Went on Valentine's Day. Happy to hear that our expected 90 minute wait only took an hour. We were able to wait in the mall, and get a text when our seats were ready. Luckily we ended with a nice booth where we had a little more intimate seating.  We split the Cobb salad and margherita pizza. There was plenty of food to go around, and the staff was very friendly and even offered to help select our entrees. If you haven't been to a Cheesecake Factory before, the menus are rather large, and of course, I always take a while to order. Overall, we were very satisfied and had some leftovers that our server was happily willing to bag for us."
Sara P.,"Roseville, CA",163,178,662,4.0,1/13/2015,"Been here many times for special occasions, work dinners and most recently for happy hour. They have a huge menu, overwhelming amount of food and everything is pretty good.  The happy hour is a great deal, lots of options, good portions, our server Lauren G. Was very friendly and was quick about making sure we had everything we needed.  Can get really busy so I suggest getting here early. Other then that, solid happy hour in roseville."
Katherine H.,"Sacramento, CA",32,87,43,2.0,1/20/2016,"Cheesecake factory doesn't take reservations for dinner after 5pm. Nor do they take reservations for the weekend. Too bad most people are still working or getting off work at 5pm.  I had a party of 10 coming in for a birthday, but without the guarantee of a table..I guess we will have to keep our $700+ meal and go somewhere else. You're not a fine dining restaurant and barely a step above an Olive Garden. If it were not for my teenage niece wanting to eat there for her birthday, I wouldn't bother with you.  Only reason why you get more than one star is the really sweet and professional hostess who answered the phone."
Adam L.,"Roseville, CA",0,13,,4.0,12/8/2016,"Fantastic Menu, Great Food all the time ! My personal favorite for a sit down restaurant"
Justin D.,"Roseville, CA",205,115,566,5.0,5/20/2015,"Celebrated my wife's birthday dinner here last night, service was fast and food was amazing as always. If you've never been to a Cheesecake Factory then you should definitely go to this one, waiting for a table is not as bad as the San Francisco branch. We were seated almost immediately when we walked in.  Service was great and the food was good as well had many options to choose from Will definitely go back"
Addison M.,"Sacramento, CA",1476,395,439,5.0,12/24/2015,Great service and great atmosphere. I always get the classic burger at every cheesecake factory I go to so maybe next time I go I will definitely try something different next time. Brookes is a great waiter and was very friendly and funny. I will definitely be back so if you go out to this location but i recommend getting him as your waiter.
Honest R.,"Anaheim, CA",2,46,8,1.0,9/15/2016,"Went back to this location after a few months to see if anything had changed. It hasn't. My previous review still stands and things are worse, not better. Interestingly enough, the same dish at a Cheesecake Factory in Southern California is still good so I asked one of the servers why. She asked the chef and came  back and said something about using different batters and ingredients. I'm not sure how accurate this is because I don't get why a large chain restaurant would do that, and they used to be exactly the same. It's gross now and I don't know how they remain busy. Must be skating by on their name alone."
Jenn B.,"Citrus Heights, CA",17,22,3,2.0,9/29/2016,Waitress is so angry... No water refills and no offer to refill the adult beverages. I'd ask but I don't wanna get a dirty look. Waitress not ours finally offered refills.
Sorinna S.,"Citrus Heights, CA",0,5,,5.0,5/8/2017,"I love Cheesecake but this review is for our server Christine. She is aaaahhhhmazing !! Excellent service, efficient, very pleasant, friendly, provides outstanding service and makes sure everyone is well taken care of. She is an asset for the company."
Carson C.,"Granite Bay, CA",371,375,37,2.0,12/23/2015,"This is the second time I've been to this location.  The first time wasn't that bad, but this time was terrible. It was pretty slow, as we went here around  2:00pm for lunch. It seemed as though there was only one waitress working, which was weird. It took forever to get menus, get beverages, food, check on us, wait for bill, etc.  I ordered ""Renee's Special"", which is a sandwich, soup & salad. The bread was extremely hard. If you have false or loose teeth, I wouldn't recommend it. It took a lot of effort to bite into it. They also don't put cheese on a turkey sandwich, which was weird. The turkey was also dry. The salad was soggy, but the dressing (Chinese Plum) was pretty good. I will say, the stuffed mushroom appetizers are great. But I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone. I think it's overrated & the service is bad."
Cindy W.,"Roseville, CA",74,55,,5.0,6/16/2016,My elderly father enjoys going here for a early dinner. There is plenty of room for him to either walk to our table with his walker or to ride his scooter. This is a major factor as it hard for him to enter crowded places. Always great service and food. The location is excellent and we can go shopping after our meal.
Hope P.,"Las Vegas, NV",44,17,13,5.0,4/16/2016,"Service was great, it did get a bit louder than the avg crowd in the bar area but it's happy hour so what can you expect."
Alexis R.,"Santa Barbara, CA",0,4,,1.0,5/25/2017,"I ordered the Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta and it was such a disappointment. It wasn't spicy at all, the chips sprinkled on top were clearly stale and the chicken had such an odd texture it made me want to gag. With the amount I paid I was expecting lots of flavor and perhaps a generous amount of chicken... I had to dig around to find the little pieces of chicken there was and it wasn't worth it because it just wasn't good. I'm currently trying to find a way to get this taste out of my mouth. Would not recommend this dish or this restaurant in general."
Lorena S.,"Modesto, CA",75,41,39,4.0,10/25/2016,Great experience! Liked how fast they worked to getting us out and yet the food was STILL very tasty. We had a play to go to after so we had a wonderful experience through the whole time.....Great choices of cheesecakes. Yum.
Kevin F.,"Yuba City, CA",0,11,2,2.0,5/20/2016,"Normally, we have a good experience here but not so much this time.  We were seated within 15 minutes which was a great start but it went downhill from there. After sitting at out table for 7 minutes, the waitress acknowledged us, saying she'd be right with us. 5 minutes later, she came to take our drink order and was shocked when we told her we'd been waiting too long... I'm offended by her polite ""I'm sorry, can I take your order now"" like we were holding HER up.   When the food got here they had run out of clam chowder so they substituted potato soup on my wife's meal without consulting her to even see if she liked potato soup... My pizza was not hot enough to satisfy my palate and the person who delivered it to the table didn't agree when I told him it wasn't hot enough... Need I say more?"
Alex I.,"Honolulu, HI",0,22,1,3.0,3/12/2016,"I love the Cheesecake Factory, in general. I assumed that they have the same consistent, efficient service throughout the country. Apparently, not this location. Went in on a rainy Friday at lunch time. There was no line and a few customers were waiting for their turn. The hostess said we would have to wait 10-15 minutes for our table. I went to the ladies room in the meantime and i passed numerous open tables both in the bar and restaurant section. What's the deal with this? Don't they want customers to be served right away? I really don't get it. This particular location is not that busy compared to the others. I'm not surprised that this is the case after my last visit to this restaurant.  Now for the food, we knew what we wanted so we ordered our food right away but it took the server 20 minutes to give us bread as ""they ran out and they are making fresh bread, as we speak"". However, the bread arrived cold. Must be frozen bread that has been thawed. Food arrived in another 20 minutes. And the place wasn't even fully occupied. What a sad experience."
Denny T.,"Sacramento, CA",187,612,403,4.0,12/3/2014,The restaurant can get fairly busy but is fairly accurate with estimated seating. Host and wait staff are consistently prompt attentive and accommodating. The last visit we had a large group of about 15 where some guests arrived a little later and order was able to be brought relatively on time with the party.  Large menu to cater to most diners. Food portions are large for most people. Enough to have leftovers more than not. Dishes are seasoned and at times a little much on spice but not to completely ruin. Bread is warm and refilled respectively. Beverages are periodically refilled appropriately. Dessert to purchase is offered. Pricy but so deliciously sweet with Seasonal offerings and year round choices.  Good: food and service.  Bad: not much to date.  I'll be back four stars.
Ed S.,"Antelope, CA",3,13,50,5.0,10/2/2016,Had another great sunday lunch at this place. were dinning at this place often and not always we had a great service like today.  We had today server Edgar who deserves a more then 5stars.  This guy do amaizing profesional job. Food : california omelet was good  and slice of white chocolate raspberry truffle cheasecake is perfect desert. Love this place and service by Edgar. If every waiters were like him-this place would  have a lot more better rewievs.
