Sophia D.,"Rocklin, CA",62,1,,1.0,5/12/2017,"The waitress my party had was wonderful, she was the sweetest lady, but our hostesses were absolutely terrible. They openly made fun of my group, clearly mocking us. They were far too young and immature to be working at such nice restaurant as they treated their hostess job as it was simply a time to make fun of their customers. The group of hostesses were very condescending and made my party feel extremely unwelcome and uncomfortable. I hope the restaurant rethinks their employee choices as it made a wonderful restaurant look very bad."
Daniel M.,"Stanford, CA",7,87,74,4.0,2/15/2016,"As always, Cheesecake Factory didn't disappoint. Stopped by this location on my way down from Tahoe going home. Ordered my usual Steak Diane (cooked medium) and Chicken Madeira combo that came with mashed potatoes. The chicken was topped with sliced mushrooms and asparagus. This has always been my go-to here and has never failed me - including this time around. For dessert, I went with their seasonal and new Salted Caramel Cheesecake. The only reason why I had to take a star away was because the cheesecake had been overwhelmingly smothered with caramel sauce on the top - which made it a bit too sweet for my sweet tooth and absolute love for cheesecake (and that's a hard thing to say!). But overall, it was still good but I couldn't eat it on my own without having to share it with the others at my table since it was very sweet. But still recommend this place for sure!"
Anna T.,"Roseville, CA",157,115,87,4.0,12/30/2014,"I love the Cheesecake Factory! Our server was on it, she was really pleasant. The food was good, as always (Jambalaya! Mmmmm). We had the Turtle Chessecake which is amazing! My kid did not like the Kid's Spaghetti and Meatballs (1 meatball to be exact). He did not like the meatball. That was a bummer. He isn't too picky either.  Otherwise everything was good!"
Sierra C.,"Wheatland, CA",0,2,,4.0,4/7/2017,"Great food. I've been here many times, but this is my first review of this amazing restaurant. I love the fact that they serve you fresh bread & butter with your drinks. This place makes THE BEST Shirley Temple. I get it every time with a glass of water. The Roseville location connected to the galleria mall always has great service. I love how the menu has SO many different items to choose from. My boyfriend and I usually order the Fried Macaroni and Cheese as our appetizer - we did again this time and the cook made it perfectly. As for the entree, I decided to try something different since it was a special occasion. I went with the Chicken Parmesan ""Pizza Style"", which was better than expected...I'm looking forward to the leftovers I have in the fridge. My boyfriend went with the Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta without the peppers and he nearly finished his whole plate. We also got cheesecake - something we don't ever do - and it was SO good! I got the Oreo Dream Extreme while my bf had the Reese's Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake Cheesecake. Both delicious (I, of course, had to have a bite of his). The only reason I give this place 4 stars is the price."
Nadia N.,"Roseville, CA",0,4,,2.0,5/16/2016,"While the taste of the food is always consistent I was not happy with my last two trips here.  Believe it or not, This was he first time I ordered cheesecake. Cheesecake was frozen when it arrived at the table but that aside food was fresh and hot. I love the ahi salad but a little more turn would be nice I feel like i paid $16 for a bunch of lettuce... Not worth it."
Casey H.,"Citrus Heights, CA",0,1,,5.0,4/22/2017,Absolutely amazing. Despite an incredibly busy Saturday night (including what appeared to be prom parties) the service was fantastic. The food was delicious and perfect with the best filet I have ever had in my life. Made my anniversary celebration truly wonderful.
J H.,"Sacramento, CA",0,8,,5.0,10/21/2016,I give a big shout out to MeMe our waitress yesterday at the Cheesecake Factory near the Galleria.  She was awesome as well as the food. No complaints from any of the 7 of us.
Criseida W.,"San Diego, CA",2,46,24,4.0,8/26/2016,"Great food, of course great desserts.  The only reason for not getting 5 stars is that even do we came quite late and the place was almost empty, our server took forever to come to check is we wanted desserts,  and of course you want dessert, otherwise you wouldn't have gone to the Cheesecake factory, right?  I guess there were just tired from the whole day work."
Drew S.,"Roseville, CA",1,5,2,1.0,11/10/2014,"3-4 bites into her BBQ chicken salad, a member of our party bit into something that didn't seem right... It was the finger of a latex/polyurethane glove. It was the single most disgusting thing I have ever witnessed at a restaurant. The manager agreed to make her something else off of the menu and comp it, however the other 3 people who lost their appetites and were unable to finish their food were still charged. The diner who got the glove was even charged for her soda. Although the manager assured us that everyone in kitchen wears gloves, the question's swirling around our heads are: Did the cook have any cuts, scabs, etc? Was it a slice of the glove that caused it to be dropped in the salad? If so, was there any blood? It seems like a mistake of this level should have been handled with a bit more than a free quesadilla. I posted a photo of the glove on Cheesecake Factory's page. I guess it could have been worse, as it kind of looks like a condom in the photo."
May A.,"Roseville, CA",718,939,13962,5.0,1/11/2014,"I'm a fan! Have not been to a Cheesecake Factory ever anywhere! This would be my first time visit and dining here... I know! As much as I love food how could I have not tried this place before! Well, as I stepped in the huge double doors I'm thinking there must be a reason why this place is so packed each time... I mean, even the happy hour tables had a waiting list. There was an older couple who just walked in and took the table next to us that was supposed to be for our party and I heard them ask our server if it was reserved, she politely said that the table was taken and they had to move elsewhere or be on the waiting list. Felt bad for the couple. For us, last night, we had to wait about 20 min to get seated... that was okay because my friend and I were still waiting for 2 more friends to complete our party.  The host was friendly and our server was great! Her name was Kayla (I believe). As much as there were so many people dining that evening she was attentive to our table and always came at the right time. She must be used to serving this many people... great and friendly service!  Okay, I haven't even gotten to talking about my food yet! I have been preparing myself to come here... I printed their menu on-line! I know, nerd, right?! Anyway, I don't do spicy so I highlighted ones I thought might be interesting to the taste... it was hard to choose but I ordered the Avocado Eggrolls! Mmm! Love at first bite... and second, and third! I also wanted to try the Fried Macaroni and Cheese. My co-worker ordered it and gave me a sampling! Mmm! Love at first bite... unfortunately, I didn't have a second, nor third! Well, there's always a next time! Hmm, I didn't have a chance to order any cheesecake this time, although, another co-worker did and he ordered the 30th Anniversary Chocolate Cake Cheesecake and he gave me a teaser sample of that... yummy!!! I took pictures for Yelp and posted to FB and garnered many 'likes' and even a trail of conversations :) It was a fun evening! Great first time experience dining here (or any Cheesecake, for that matter). I only have one thing I didn't like, ready?!... although the ambiance was nice, the lighting (for me) was a bit dim! What can I say, I'm old. Luckily for me, I printed the menu online before coming to the restaurant... hehehe :) By the time we left around 6:30 the place was more full to the outside. Is this normal for any Cheesecake Factory? Review #0178"
Jeanice S.,"Sacramento, CA",269,271,424,3.0,1/2/2016,"Food: I love their ribeye steak here. They are the only ones I've found that serve it on a place with some kind of juice that helps the meat stay juicy. Although, the steak does not stay warm throughout the whole time you're eating it, or maybe I'm just a slow eater, but there are some places that cook the steak with the plate so well that every bite of the steak is warm. I do like their pastas, but they got rid of the sun-dried tomatoes pasta, which was THE best pasta they had on their menu. I've tried a few of their pastas, and they're good but nothing out of the ordinary. Their french fries are crunchy and golden. They always serve two huge onion rings with the steaks, and it's OK. They side vegetables are plain. I ordered the string beans and broccoli once and they could have been cooked a little longer. Their PASSION FRUIT MOJITO is delicious! It has the right amount of everything in there. My boyfriend likes this location's food more than the Elk Grove location. Service: Sometimes we get a waiter that is great, sometimes we get a waiter that just isn't that happy. I don't come to this location much but the waiters seem not as cheerful as the ones in Elk Grove.  Price: The price is kind of expensive but then you do get a large amount. They try to make the place a more casual upscale restaurant, but I think some of their prices is outrageous.  BTW, parking is very crowded."
Valerie K.,"Citrus Heights, CA",501,648,933,4.0,12/31/2014,"For New Years Eve, it was only a 25-30 minute wait which wasn't bad. Food was great. Skinnylicious menu is a nice new addition for those watching calories. Only complaint is that we had to ask for for the sugar which is usually at the table, that and we weren't served our appetizer bread until shortly before the food came while everyone else was getting theirs shortly after being seated. Otherwise, it was a pleasant, carefree experience."
Jason S.,"Roseville, CA",543,716,1840,4.0,4/28/2013,"I must say i really love the Saturday/Sunday brunch they have here...The key is there is not a ton of selection, but what they do have is dialed in. I personally like the pork chiqualla's they have served with eggs and homemade tortilla chips. This is not to mention sipping on some delicious mojito's or mimosa's. The selection is great with items like lemon ricotta pancakes (these are the bomb!), juevos rancheros, monte cristo and awesome fresh fruit and yogurt.  If in Roseville a definite place to hit up for brunch and if you are like the lady that sat by us at brunch you can skip past all the food and go straight to ordering cheese cake which this place is known for. If you have lived for the amount of time that you have and not allowed yourself to be pleasured by some cheesecake from here STOP! Make this a reality in the next 10 days...best cheesecake selection on the planet. if you can dream up they have it red velvet(yes), carmel apple pie (yes), key lime (yes and one of my personal favs), Plain (yes, but why) , strawberry and this is soooo good! (yes), turtle (yes)...you get it!  BTW...just in case you have been living in another universe other than earth they also have a great dinner and lunch selection. My personal favs are the jambalaya and the lemon roasted chicken. Also to include the fish tacos...on a last note if you are ever in San Francisco get to the Cheese Cake factory at the top of Macy's downtown. Same menu but they have absolutely one of the best views in the entire city."
Ida H.,"Sacramento, CA",978,1009,10894,5.0,3/11/2013,"I can't believe that in how many years the Cheesecake Factory has been around, that as much as I have always wanted to eat there, I never got around to going there until now!  Since we were going to be in the area, a plan was made, destinations were mapped out, and this restaurant was agreed upon as where we were going to eat! Even though the Cheesecake Factory is a chain restaurant that some people might snub their noses at, I couldn't be more impressed at the visually appealing décor of Egyptian and Art Deco combinations of the interior!  It actually took my breath away, because this is my kind of taste!  I knew then and there that I was going to love this place no matter what!   The menus are extensive with food selections that would appeal to every appetite.  Even so, cheesecake was always in the back of my mind.  But we didn't want to feel too guilty by not eating something more substantial, so my boyfriend and I decided on eating some healthy salads first.  Our waitress Natalie was very nice and had a fun sense of humor as she guided us through the menu as first timers of this restaurant.  Our meals began with huge glasses of Diet Coke and ice tea with some hot, fresh breads and butter.  Then we ordered an appetizer of their popular Avocado egg rolls with an accompaniment of a sweet tasting dipping sauce.  Everything was perfect right from the start!   The main course: I ordered the Carlton Salad, while Joe K ordered the Luau Salad.  I couldn't believe the huge portions that were piled on our plates!  My salad was very good and had plenty of Romaine lettuce, grilled white meat chicken, feta cheese, avocado, dried cranberries, raisins, pears, oranges and pecans tossed in a vinaigrette dressing.  On the other hand, my boyfriend had the Luau Salad, but didn't seem as impressed with his, stating that it lacked some of the ingredients and flavor he was expecting this salad to contain.   Eventually, I had to stop eating salad or I wouldn't have room for dessert, so I got the rest to go.  The exciting finale arrived as we ordered the cheesecake!  I got the Caramel Pecan Turtle and bf got the White Chocolate Caramel Macadamia Nut.  I didn't want to slice into these mouth-watering works of art, but forced myself anyway!  The combinations of chocolates, fudge, caramel, nuts and creamy cheesecake just can't be described in writing.  You'll just have to try it yourself!  Now I know why they named this restaurant after its heavenly desserts!  A great marketing tool that will draw in cheesecake lovers like me into becoming a continuous patron!                 My dreaded business mini trip to Rocklin, CA couldn't have turned out to be more of a successful and fun filled day that was highlighted by eating at the Cheesecake Factory!"
Aimee A.,"Rocklin, CA",66,37,60,4.0,5/6/2015,"The food was great, but the seating was uncomfortable and the music was too loud. Obviously the food is the most important to me but the other things brought it down to a 4/5.  I tried the crab bites and avacado egg roll appetizers, and a salmon dish with cous cous and pesto sauce. All great and I was left with a large amount left for lunch the next day (pictured in my photo)"
Heidi D.,"Santa Rosa, CA",201,554,1076,4.0,10/20/2014,"Thai Lettuce Wraps & Fried Chicken sliders = perfect! Everything tasted great this time so I don't know if it was luck or this particular CF but I was happy!   We came at 10:30pm and were one of only a few in the restaurant.  Service was efficient but not pushy, given the late hour.  Topped off with a cherry cheesecake to go! Yum.  We were craving those lettuce wraps the next day."
Tracey V.,"Roseville, CA",11,13,4,5.0,2/6/2016,"One of my Top 3. Food, drink galore. Oh and desert!  To go! Can't miss at Cheescake Factory!"
H. H.,"Chico, CA",1,115,4,4.0,8/21/2016,"We decided to go back and try it again. I feel bad I do not know our waitress's name but she was wonderful. Had a group of kids and she was great with them, no ones glass was ever empty. Avocado eggrolls!! If I were dying this may be my last meal request lol Just goes to show that wait staff really can make all the difference in your restaurant experience. Salted caramel cheesecake is the best of all we had. So glad we gave it another shot:)"
Vivian P.,"Roseville, CA",166,299,90,4.0,1/4/2016,What can I say about the Cheesecake Factory - who doesn't like this place? Huge menu and a variety of cheesecake :) YAY. I would give the place 5 stars if it wasn't so freaking expensive! My go to dish - and no judgement - is the Mexican Tortilla Salad - but with the wasabi vinaigrette on the side. I know - what a weird mix of flavors but i love the ingredients in the Mexican Tortilla and the flavors in the wasabi vinaigrette. They got rid of the wasabi vinaigrette for a while but I'm glad i asked for it because it's back! i don't think they sell it up front for take home - but honestly - even if they did who can finish a huge jar in 5-7 days unless they are having a party right? This salad runs like $13.99 or $14.99 - a bit pricey for let's be honest - a salad. I do love how they have the variety of bread and butter for the table - that's a highlight since there's usually 2-3 kinds of bread :) yum. As for cheesecake - we are slowly going through all the flavors but my most recent endeavor which I love is the Dulce de Leche Cheesecake - not to sweet and SO YUMMY :) Again - all forms of payment - including Discover card is accepted!
Nicholas T.,"Sacramento, CA",22,21,11,4.0,8/7/2016,"I've always eaten at the cheese cake factory several times after a day of shopping, but this time was a little bit off. The hostess as well as the servers are always very nice, but today I just felt as if the food proportion and presentation was a little off. Everything else was great as usual!"
