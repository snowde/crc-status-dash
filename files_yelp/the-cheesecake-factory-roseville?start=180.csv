Carly A.,"Irvine, CA",2,148,,5.0,8/6/2016,"I went here with my family for my birthday tonight and it was super crowded and busy. We had a choice of indoor seating or outdoor and we chose indoor because sitting outside was a longer wait. We were seated after about 15 minutes and our server was super nice. I believe his name was Mike (or Matthew?) he was very knowledgeable about the menu and made a lot of recommendations. I liked how there was a light menu (under 590 calories) so that way I don't feel as guilty when I eat their cheesecake lol. There's also bread to snack on while you wait for your food. The wait wasn't too bad especially since we had the bread there. The food was delicious and the portions were a good size. The cheesecake was delicious! Overall, I had a really good time there tonight and would definitely come back."
Lindy G.,"Orangevale, CA",0,20,1,4.0,3/29/2017,"My boyfriend and I really like coming here for dinner. We come here every so often and usually have a decent experience. We came here about a week ago and waited for about 25 minutes for a table. We got seated near the bar and a table of three got seated next to us a couple minutes later. We sat there for about 15 minutes and hadn't been greeted. The table next to us already had their drinks and put in orders for their appetizers. I went to the hostess stand to ask if we had a waiter assigned to our table. The host went and found a manager. Paige came to our table and apologized for the wait and took our orders immediately. She had another waitress take care of us after that, and she checked on us at the end of our meal and gave us a free dessert. This really redeemed the night for us, and made us feel cared about. Thank you Paige, for making it a good experience after all!"
Brad W.,"Sacramento, CA",1,39,22,5.0,4/21/2015,We had a great experience at this spot. The food was excellent and even though the restaurant was crowded it did not slow the service.  My only recommendation is to check the menu on line. It is extensive.
Rachel T.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,7,2,4.0,2/27/2017,"I went today with my boyfriend for lunch and dessert and overall it was a nice experience. The menus are huge and take a lot of time to go through but our waitress was very patient as we took our time looking it over. I had the Evelyn's favorite pasta and was surprised at how unique and tasty it was! My reason for not giving the full five stars is because the dish actually was served to me luke warm and was getting cold as I kept eating. However, when I told the waitress, she happily took it back to be re-heated. Would have been better if the food was hot to begin with but that's okay. I'm happy with how the staff handled it. Just makes me wonder how long the food was in the warmer/how fresh the food is. The cheesecakes, of course, were delicious so no complaint there! I had the Tiramisu cheesecake and my boyfriend had a Salted Caramel cheesecake. Both were super yummy. Lunch was good. Dessert was excellent!"
Mey S.,"Suisun City, CA",99,38,484,4.0,8/31/2014,If you want great service and a good laugh ask for: Hank (the waiter) Perfect location to stop at right after shopping @ the Galleria. Food is good.
George T.,"West Sacramento, CA",1,5,2,1.0,8/5/2017,"We love the Cheesecake Factory and today we came to the Galleria Cheesecake Factory after our family outing. Today they were busy and the wait was not long and they managed the seating very well. While we were waiting our 4 year old daughter asked for water. So, I went to the bar and the bartender gave me a plastic cup with lid and a straw. It was great. Our server and the runners did a great job we were served quickly and unrushed. The drinks and  food were delivered in a very appropriate time frame. Our family of 7 were well taken care of and the food was great, the service was great and then came the bill. I reviewed the bill and it was correct without an error. I checked the helpful tipping suggestions and it looked high, so I calculated it with my smart phone calculator and to my surprise and shock The Cheesecake Factory calculates the tax as part of the service tip suggestion. This should never happen with any restaurant and if The Cheesecake Factory is miscalculating this what other shenanigans are happening behind the curtain? Cheesecake Factory please correct your computer algothrim to make suggestions based on service, food quality, ambience and professionalism of your staff and management...  tipping suggestions are never based on tax. We, your customers trust your ""suggestions"" please be the ethical and trust worthy firm we all believe you to be."
Maria K.,"Granite Bay, CA",306,135,540,1.0,7/10/2014,"I ordered the arugula salad and the Vietnamese spring roll. Unfortunately I noticed that the Shirimp had not been cleaned. The black streak was clearly there. Also before we were seated, I was looking in the cheesecake display case and saw that there was a hair on one of the slices. I did tell someone so they can remove it."
Stacy S.,"Sacramento, CA",93,11,2,4.0,3/27/2016,"I love this place! Friendly staff, great food! I always leave this place fully satisfied"
Misti S.,"Modesto, CA",0,1,,5.0,8/10/2017,"Me and my girlfriend went in to eat as we had to charge are car around the corner. While we sat there we notice a military man eating by himself so we decided to pay his bill but realized that we didn't have enough cash to pay it. When we where done, I went to go get the car and my credit card to pay both bills and while I was gone my girlfriend decided to joke around with waitress. She told the waitress that we had gotton into a fight and I left her there all by herself and she only had 40+ dollars on her and that wouldn't cover the bill but she was more than willing to work off the rest. The waitress told her to keep her money so she could get a ride home and will have the manager void the bills. When I got back with car to pay the bills, she told me the story of how kind the waitress was and what she was going to do to help my girlfriend. People like this in life that are concerned about others welfare and will go out of their way to help should always be shown how much we love their heart and not let it go unrewarded or unnoticed. We thank you so much for your caring heart and I can never repay you for the care you took of my girlfriend when you thought I had left her behind!!! I hope our simple gesture to thank you will have been enough to make you see that people really see your love and compassion for others!!!!!!!!!"
Margarita Y.,"Fair Oaks, CA",3,33,10,5.0,12/20/2015,We really like to come here for a nice dinner. We like the service and their food is really good. Our all time favorite is shrimp scampi! Always satisfies. Also their Godiva chocolate cheesecake is the bomb.
Micki M.,"Sacramento, CA",421,617,5195,5.0,5/15/2014,"Came here to celebrate my birthday on Mother's Day weekend. Since they don't accept reservations or call ahead seating, we arrived a half an hour early to wait for a table for nine of us. As expected, the place was packed! But then again, this place is always packed. But, we were able to get a table in about forty minutes, not bad considering it's Mother's Day weekend.  While we waited for others to arrive, we waited at a table in the bar. Adam, our server was very friendly and knowledgeable. While hubs ordered his usual adult beverage, Long Island, I wanted something different, Adam knew that I was indecisive, he gave me some suggestions, and when I decided on one he didn't recommend, he suggests the Passion Fruit Margarita. When my drink arrived, it was delicious! Something new, out of my norm, nice change!  When the rest of our party arrived, we were seated in the patio area, at first I was reluctant, it was a windy day but it was very tolerable, since the table was closest to the building. Madison, was our server for the dining area and she was phenomenal. She was very professional, expedient, and attentive.  It took our party a lengthy amount of time deciding what to eat, especially me. There's over twenty pages in their menu with a variety of entrees, salads, apps, sandwiches, burgers, and desserts. I like that there's a bit of almost every internationally inspired dish here. There's Chinese, Italian, Mexican, Greek, Japanese, and American. With so many choices, it was super difficult to make a decision. On this visit, we had Moroccan chicken, bistro shrimp, meatloaf, fish n' chips, lemon chicken, miso glazed salmon, french dip, teriyaki chicken and flat bread pizza. Everything was delicious. I tasted my brother's Moroccan chicken on a bed of cous cous, it was really good. I had to sample the ever popular miso glazed salmon and that was phenomenal! The salmon was grilled to perfection with a crusty outer exterior. Seasoned to perfection. I think I'll be ordering that on my next visit. The teriyaki chicken was yummy as well, I had asked my daughter if she was sure about her choice because she is very finicky about her teriyaki chicken. She had it before,  therefore she was adamant in her choice. She made an excellent choice, loved the presentation including grilled plantains.  Cheesecake Factory has been a favorite chain restaurant of ours. From the friendly and professional staff, to the beautiful interior and lastly, the food!  We've never been disappointed!"
Neda B.,"Roseville, CA",0,3,,1.0,8/21/2016,"Won't go there again, not only they have a poor customer service they won't cook their food properly. For the price that they charge you at least you expect  a better customer service and a better food. 08/21/16"
Erik B.,"Roseville, CA",25,69,24,2.0,2/6/2015,"I had not been to this location in years. The atmosphere is very typical of the Roseville crowd. The wait time was average for a Friday in Roseville about 25 minutes.  The server was so-so at first but she came around more once our food arrived.  I ordered the chicken Marsala with mushrooms and bow-tie noodles. The flavor was not there, I've had better. I was so hungry, so I ate as much as I could.  For Dessert I tried the Fresh Banana Cream Cheesecake, it was good and refreshing.  There is a reason why this place is called The Cheesecake Factory. They're specialty is cheesecake, not pastas, burgers etc."
Brittany W.,"Rocklin, CA",131,117,107,3.0,5/17/2015,"If you've never dined here, you should know: Cheesecake Factory is pricy for what you get. Fish and chips is $17. A mojito will set you back $11.50. A slice of cheesecake starts about $8.  Now I don't mind emptying my pocketbook for dinner because I LOVE food, but after dining here again and again I have come to the conclusion: it's just not worth it. It is NOT bad, but I never find myself craving it either. When reminded of the prices after a recent visit, I'm just not impressed. Our service was less than average. It wasn't bad, but it was the kind of service that makes you irritated that tipping 18% is customary in our country. For an addition 18% on top of already overpriced food, I would like impressive service. Unfortunately I didn't find that here. Our waiter was busy, I'll give him that, but more specifically I felt he was distracted. We didn't get ignored and service wasn't bad, it simply wasn't anything beyond sufficient.  To summarize: In my opinion Cheesecake Factory is overpriced average food served in a very unmemorable fashion. Now, lunch time and happy hour is another story. For those I would happily return to reevaluate."
Sassy F.,"Citrus Heights, CA",0,4,,5.0,2/8/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory is the best place to eat for any occasion. I love the atmosphere, the food and obviously without a doubt... their cheesecake. I love cheesecake and this is the place to go for it. I come here for my birthday every year and will continue to."
Tracy M.,"Roseville, CA",74,232,35,3.0,5/15/2015,"While the Cheesecake Factory has a bible sized menu with a plethora of options, both healthy and unhealthy, the taste is never quite worth the price.  The service is usually mediocre, at best. It seems as though they assign too many tables to their wait staff.The delays for getting drinks, refills on drinks, bread dropped off, and paying the bill leaves us looking around like ""where on earth could the waiter be?""  I do enjoy that they have a full bar and the cocktails are always good. My favorite is their Mai Tai."
Jenna W.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,17,17,4.0,1/4/2015,"Came here with my boyfriend a few weeks ago and we got the pasta carbonara, spicy chipotle chicken pasta, fried calamari, and crispy crab bites (mini crab cakes). The pasta carbonara was soooo good. My absolute fave thing there now. Not really a big fan of the chipotle pasta anymore. The chicken was a bit dry. The fried calamari is always good! I love the calamari at Cheesecake Factory! Always my favorite. But the crab bites were gross. It was so dry and hard and not as good as the normal crab cakes. It was such small pieces and didn't taste much crab. Granted it was only around $6 or $7, I would rather pay full price for the normal crab cakes.  The service was ok. I forgot who our server was but she had short dark curly hair. We were often forgotten about because we were seated in the corner near the kitchen. But it was really busy that day so I don't blame them."
Teresa D.,"Fair Oaks, CA",52,12,,5.0,6/21/2016,Had dinner here. Food is always good. Our server was great.  I love that they have a gluten free menu and a skinny menu
Rose G.,"Folsom, CA",2297,167,106,5.0,3/28/2014,"Coming here to eat healthy is pretty dumb. They do have a great skinnylicious menu, but lets get real. do we ever come here for our health?? i don't think so. Even before i moved here, we would always stop here when traveling from the bay area to reno. It is literally that amazing. I love their fresh strawberries and whip cream, their carrot cake, lemon cake, their oreo cheesecake, and the classic cheesecake. it is all so good its hard to choose from. i love coming here for dinner, although it can get very teeny-boppery from mall-goers. Also everyone comes here for their birthdays so expect to hear a lot of birthday singing. Their bread is always warm and soft and delicious, and they make great drinks with a gorgeous bar area. love their pasta dishes! The waitstaff are all super friendly, and the hostesses are actually nice and not super snotty like some other cheesecakes we have been to."
Paul K.,"Glendale, CA",2020,102,26,4.0,10/11/2015,"The owner or manager is doing something right at this Cheesecake Factory.   Went there last week with an employee.  My first time in Roseville.  Such a nice city. All the waiters and servers here are super friendly.  And that makes all the difference. As far as the food at Cheesecake.  Some dishes are good, some are ok.  You just never know.  The menu is way too big.  FOCUS Cheesecake... FOCUS!"
