Dirty D.,"Redding, CA",35,674,410,5.0,2/25/2015,"Excellent service.  Ashley took very good care of us. The place was nearly full for a Monday lunchtime.  I ordered the chicken enchiladas.  It was serced CalMex style, which I expected.  The enchiladas themselves were good, but the black beans and the rice were great.  I'd come back more often if it were closer to Redding. All the others loved the desserts, too."
Douglas Y.,"Sacramento, CA",569,893,2281,4.0,9/10/2013,"Happy hour is always a pleasure at Cheesecake and the Roseville location makes good on that claim.  While all Cheesecake's look pretty much identical inside the service at this location was fast, friendly and informative.  The happy hour menu has been revamped since the last time we visited and notably the calamari is no longer on the menu.  In addition the prices seem to have gone up around .50 or so.  We had tried the following items: $5 mojito: yum! sometimes you can make it a coconut mojito if you ask for Malibu, if the bartender is nice they will do it for no extra charge $5 Sweet Corn Cakes one of our favorites of sweet corn bread like cakes topped with sour cream, pico de gallo, and avocado.  The server who brought these out said he orders them with shredded pork on top  OMG mouth watering idea! $6 or $6.50  Mini Corn Dogs:  ummm just average wouldn't order these again beef hotdog was too salty and batter wasn't crispy $6.95 tempura avocado, zucchini and portabello mushroom: The mushroom was to die for, super crispy outside and melt in your mouth inside. The zucchini was delicious but the deep fried avocado was a miss as far as we are concerned. $6.50 sausage flat bread pizza, this seemed smaller and more expensive, but still tasty, probably not worth $6.50 any longer though. $3.50-$4 or so Strawberry Lemonade: this was crazy good, not to sweet not to tart with free refills a huge hit. As I said earlier Happy Hour is always a pleasure at Cheesecake and Roseville is definitely up to par."
Julie M.,"Stockton, CA",0,6,,4.0,5/18/2016,Came here with my husband this past weekend. I ordered chicken marsala and he ordered the rib eye steak. I thought it was delicious. Cooked just right and portions were huge. My husband wanted his steak well done and they brought him out a medium steak. The waiter took it back and brought him a very well done steak. He ate it anyway lol Our strawberry cheesecake was delicious. Service was really good. Our waiter gave us lots of attention.
Heidi N.,"Roseville, CA",4,31,2,4.0,3/11/2016,"I dined there on December 8, 2015 with a girlfriend, Nicole S. was our server, and she was FANTASTIC!  She needs to work at a more upscale restaurant she is that good!  Any way we had a few martini's Lemon, Asian Pear and Strawberry and two margaritas. The drinks were all good (good job bartender) and she was honest and steered us in the right direction.  I have always loved their strawberry martinis and she said strawberries are not in season are you sure...? She was right not a sweet so I tried the others...We order a Old Fashion Cheeseburger and Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes and both were good.  Rarely have ever had a bad experience at The Cheesecake Factory but this was an exceptional good visit because of service!  Good Job Nicole S.!!!"
Lily D.,"Modesto, CA",9,1,1,4.0,5/23/2015,Great service and yummy food! Got the tamale cakes for an appetizer and it was delicious! Love coming here!
Brittany D.,"Fair Oaks, CA",116,268,41,5.0,3/4/2015,"This is my favorite restaurant!  The food is so yummy and they have such a large menu to select from.  I always have a hard time picking out which cheesecake I want for desert, there are so many to choose from.  We always come here for my birthday dinner, I love the pasta da vinci, could eat it everyday! Service has always been good, especially for how busy they get."
Doug A.,"Roseville, CA",47,42,1,1.0,1/21/2016,"Last time I'll ever spend the amount of money I did at this dump. $30 for the WORST steak I've ever had. The entire experience was terrible, not only on my last visit, but every time I have chosen to eat here. It just reminds me of a cafeteria that is pretending to serve high end food. Place is a joke and extremely over priced. My recommendation is to go elsewhere."
Kearstin C.,"Lincoln, CA",52,76,29,2.0,12/19/2014,"I am not a fan of this restaurant. If you want cheese cake; sure go to the CCF. If you want good food; go elsewhere; the menu is too big... which to me usually translates to a bunch of mediocre food.I prefer places with smaller more specialized menus. One thing I will say, the fried mac and cheese is really good. To expensive for the low quality food; over hyped."
Tyler C.,"Auburn, CA",1,7,2,5.0,8/6/2015,Kat was a great server! Very attentive and extremely friendly. If it were my restaurant I would probably consider promoting her to management as she obviously has what it takes in the service industry and has been doing this for a long time.  The sweet corn cakes are a must try (could be a main course if you aren't too hungry).  Great experience at the Cheesecake Factory!
Melanie M.,"Auburn, CA",3,65,3,2.0,3/6/2015,"I used to love coming here, but two main aspects have been declining. I've given the number of stars for the following reasons:  1) Service. It's been continuously getting worse. Less drink refills, less checking on how we're doing... The last time I came, I was waiting for my BF. I was seated and forgotten until he arrived 40 minutes later. I knew he'd be late, but I expected to be checked on by staff. No bread. No asking if I wanted to order anything while I waited. The waitress brought me water and never returned. Even after he arrived, she only checked on us once. No drink refills. Just felt pushed out.  2) Food portions: my favorite dish is the Lemon herb chicken dish. Still is. But the portions were half what they normally are! I've noticed it getting smaller, but this was ridiculous. One time, while big and pregnant, they brought this dish and the chicken was raw!!! I had to send it back, which I very rarely do. Everyone was done eating by the time my meal came back."
Ashley P.,"Sacramento, CA",5,17,2,5.0,2/21/2016,"My fiancé and I always enjoying coming here. We enjoy their egg rolls for appetizers and always get salmon, pasta and steak from here. Oh and I can't forget the cheesecake. The servers are always pleasant."
Mitch T.,"Kealakekua, HI",250,238,157,5.0,1/22/2016,"Decided to try The Cheesecake Factory for the first time, while visiting Roseville from Hawaii.  Was extremely happy with the service we received from Rachel, who was not only very accommodating, but also, very personable and patient.  Left a very lasting first impression.  Let's hope when I try The Cheesecake Factory in Honolulu, I hope there is a ""Rachel"" like employee there too!"
Dale B.,"Shingle Springs, CA",10,66,3,4.0,3/28/2015,Nicole S is a great server and today everything was spot on! On the previous visit the server forgot my dinner salad and didn't offer us any bread. It was abysmal. But nevertheless when we shop at Westfield we just end up at Cheesecake every time. Thank you Nicole for making this experience top notch
JEN M.,"Rocklin, CA",119,275,64,3.0,1/7/2015,"Hostess was helpful and sweet. Got sat quick. When When I got to the table the whole seat was covered in bread crumbs,  and the table was not super clean either.  It had something sticky,  but no big deal, just thought I would throw that in there.... Tim was our server he was cool! I ordered avocado egg rolls and the beet/ goat cheese salad. Very yummy. He was very attentive and knowledge when it came to helping me chose a pasta. The place was packed on a wed night but yet our server was always around when we needed him. Thanks tim! Hope the managers see this and u get a nice pat on the back!  Or a free beer! (A gluten free one) I gave 3 stars instead of 4 because of the lack of cleanliness. .... but that was a busser issue I am sure. ..."
Jenni T.,"Roseville, CA",346,970,7114,3.0,10/20/2013,"If I was comparing The Cheesecake Factory to other chain restaurants, then it's about average. If I was comparing it to local restaurants, then I would stay away. Food- 2.5/5. For the money you get HUGE portions. Please take half of it home! Or don't eat anything else for three days. Your choice. I honestly can't really find anything here that I particularly like with the exception of two things. The cheesecake is really good and they have a ton of flavors so it kind of doesn't even taste like cheesecake sometimes which is good. Cause I don't really like cheesecake. The other thing is the ranch dressing. Yes, that's right, they have the best ranch dressing I have ever tested. Hard to believe right? I still have not found anything to compare. Other than those two things, everything else is eh. The Grilled Cheese is edible, salads are OK, nachos are fine, the garlic noodles are gross, and well, that's about all the vegetarian options. My Husband loves their Shepherds Pie which he gets every time we come here. Either it is that good, or he likes nothing else.  Atmosphere- 5/5. The restaurants are always so beautiful. Nicely painted, interesting light fixtures, comfy booths, etc. great for a night or with the family or date. Service- 4/5. I don't think I've ever had bad service here. There always seems to be enough people working and they are attentive.  Vegetarian Friendliness- 2/5. As mentioned above, there are only a few things on a menu with 30 pages for vegetarians. Kind of disappointing! And they are just the basics too, grilled cheese, salad, nachos, etc. You would think they would have more inventive dishes considering the menu. Overall- 2.5/5. If I had a choice between The Cheesecake Factory and another chain restaurant, I may pick The Cheesecake Factory. Or not. If I had a choice between The Cheesecake Factory and pretty much any local restaurant in town, I would eat local and save 3000 calories while doing it."
Ernest R.,"San Francisco, CA",356,8,,3.0,5/9/2015,"So the three stars are only there because A: the service was very nice. And B: i only got vegetarian items so i shouldve had low standards anyways haha.  The food i got though, I would rate a zero.  The veggie burger, minus mayo and add avocado.  The portion was huge which was cool to look at, but the patty destroyed it.  Absolutely the worst veggie burger i have ever tasted.  And to be fair everyone else at my table enjoyed their food.  But when your veggie burger tastes and feels like a ton of cheap black pepper and soggy brown rice... I mean come on just try a different recipe please.  But like i said the service was super friendly and everyone else enjoyed their food."
Myra A.,"Roseville, CA",114,54,283,4.0,1/5/2015,"So I've  returned 2 more times since my last review, and thank you CF for redeeming yourself here at the Bar.  The HH menu, as I've said before is double thumbs up. 5 stars!  My last 2 experiences have been excellent service!!   I enjoy being able to dine atthe bar with my son who is not 21 yet, and we're able to sit at a table in the bar area. Good times CF. Thanks again for making right. I'll continue to give you my business."
Serene A.,"Tahoe City, CA",0,3,,5.0,10/4/2016,"I was extremely happy with my choice to go to the Cheesecake Factory. Our server Kelsey T., did a wonderful job. She was very friendly and had wonderful customer service. It was refreshing having such a laid back, yet, attentive server. She was quick to get us a new beer, bring boxes, and our to go cheesecake... we will be back!"
Joe K.,"Sacramento, CA",731,610,440,4.0,2/26/2013,"The Cheesecake Factory was my next stop on my quest for the best salad in Sacramento.  Believe it or not, my girl friend and I had never been to a Cheesecake Factory.  We both liked the large roomy interior which kind of reminded me of something you might see at Disneyland. We were promptly seated in a nice comfortable booth next to a window (I guess we just live right) where our waitress took our drink orders and gave us extensive menus that resembled children's books in both size and the thickness of the pages.  We were in no way intimidated by the size of these menus and immediately found our way to the lunch salad specials.  (It helps to be on a quest.) I think the waitress was quite surprised when she returned with our drinks and we already had decided on our orders.  We shared an avocado eggroll appetizer, Ida ordered a Carlton Salad and I ordered a Luau Salad.  The avocado eggroll was so damn good and I must admit that it set me up extremely well for the disappointment they called the Luau Salad. The chicken they use on their salads is a bit on the disgusting side.  It has kind of a boiled gelatinous texture and is completely void of any resemblance of flavor.  The rest of the salad was mostly lettuce with barely a touch of each of the vegetables they had mentioned on the menu.  The fried wontons were good and the dressing was good but they were not even close to being enough to save this boring mound of mediocrity.  I could barely even taste the meager distribution of sesame seeds that was my reason for ordering the Luau Salad in the first place. Now for the good part:  What do you do when you go to the Cheesecake Factory?  You eat Cheesecake.  I ordered a slice of White Chocolate Caramel Macadamia Nut Cheesecake and Ida ordered a slice of Caramel Pecan Turtle Cheesecake.  I am surprised they don't have the paramedics standing by.   You should have seen the size of those slices of cheesecake.  They were rather large and very rich and decadently topped with whipped cream.  I think I must have gained ten pounds before I even took a bite.  Oh; but it was a wonderful ten pounds indeed. My suggestion would be to order the avocado eggrolls and the cheesecake.  Skip the salad, it is a complete waste of calories. P.S.  Our waitress was wonderful."
Irena K.,"Orangevale, CA",61,17,114,5.0,2/1/2015,"Cheesecake Factory is a place to go when I'm really hungry. Even then, a normal portion can be easily split between two people. The variety of the menu will satisfy any tastebuds. They took the Bbq salmon off the menu. But it has been replaced with Genovese salmon, which to my mind is much better and more flavorful!!! My new favorite. My husband and I really like Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp - a very rich and flavorful Thai style dish, too mild as for the thai style though. The small appetizer salads are great too and cheap! I've tried every single one of them and they were yummy. Also, CF has the best mashed potatoes of all places in town! Besides the ones that I make at home  I am a foodie and since their plates are huge, we seem to almost never make it to desserts. But once my husband and I tried the lemon meringue cheesecake and it was delicious!!!"
