MaKenzie A.,"Camino, CA",3,19,3,5.0,3/9/2016,Whenever I eat here I love to get a variety of picks from the small plates menu. The cocktails here are very good but quite pricey for what they are. The cheesecakes are always delicious.
Mandy C.,"San Jose, CA",116,95,,3.0,3/29/2015,"Pros: Beautiful interior, excellent location, has a ""skinnylicious"" menu (but even then, a salad is 570 calories...and dressing isn't included :/ )  Cons: Very pricy, very loud (constantly heard dishes banging), not the greatest service."
Joe P.,"Rocklin, CA",141,434,73,4.0,11/18/2014,"Out of all chain restaurants, this is one of the best.  There are obviously a lot of reviews to get a good understanding of this place... but I have a few tips. First - the service is not the fastest.  If you know what you want when you order your drinks, I recommend you do it - otherwise you won't get it for a while. It isn't  a terrible wait - but I believe this place is under staffed.  Once you order your food, service seems a bit normal. Second - if you have kids, get the ""kids plate""... I didn't even realize they had this, but the hostess asked me if we wanted it.  All it is is 4 pieces of bread and some banana slices.  This makes this place worth the money alone! You know how many restaurants I go to just hoping my kid doesn't freak out while in his high-chair.  The kids plate will keep him entertained until you get your food )my kid is 18 months, BTW). Lastly - a food review. Typically I order the skinnylicious soft tacos... which are basically 3 tacos which are really, really good.  If you order their normal size plate, it is inly 3 dollars more and you get FOUR tacos and rice/beans. Anyway, love this place beyond the cheesecake (which is definitely awesome).  I definitely plan to return again."
Rick L.,"Carson City, NV",39,152,218,5.0,1/3/2015,Came down after Christmas for some shopping.  We had lunch here as we usually do.  I tried something new.  I had the southwest chicken sandwich. It was fantastic. My daughter had the Orange chicken; it too was good.
Erica Q.,"Carmichael, CA",49,54,79,5.0,8/24/2014,"My partner and I come here all of the time! I love this place, the food, the service, the ambience...everything is perfect! I love their omelets and mimosas for brunch and their salad and pastas for lunch/dinner. Of course, their cheesecake is to die for but only as a special treat every once in a while. Also, their bar does have a Happy Hour."
Darren N.,"Roseville, CA",14,20,1,4.0,9/14/2014,"I went here with my family a few days ago. We had a blonde Brigitte Nielsen look alike who served us. I thought that she would start off with ""I must break you"" but instead took our drink orders quickly and efficiently. Every time we ran low on drinks her hand shot out to grab the ailing glass and rescue it from empty mediocrity. I had the buffalo burger. It was pretty good. We also had the meatloaf, pizza, and some chicken balls.  No dessert just a quick stroll to the car and home for a much needed escape to the bathroom.  The food was good but I couldn't do it everyday.  Brigitte, keep up the good efficient work!!! Flava flav!"
Amber V.,"Antelope, CA",1,28,,4.0,3/24/2016,Delicious food with a lot of menu options to choose from and the carrot cake cheese cake is amazing
Bruce W.,"Folsom, CA",66,21,6,1.0,7/27/2014,"Holy crap.  They have way too many idiotic immature girls working at this joint.  Came in at around 5:19 PM.  There was one family of four in front of us.  The idiot at the counter said ""5 minutes.""  Turns out she was too busy flirting with some other server in a blue short to remember that we requested a table for two.   What was supposed to be ""5 minutes"" turned into a 25 minute wait, because we were forgotten and three other couple/family was put in front of us. When we brought this to the girls attention, she said she'll ""check on it.""  And then commenced to chat some more before saying we were in luck and a table opened up!   We finally got to our table, almost 35 minutes after her ""5 minutes"" only remark.   The only saving grace of the meal was because of our server, Jennifer.  She was great, and it's ONLY because of her that I left a 20% tip for that meal. Suck it, Cheesecake Factory.  Go hire some better greeters, or whatever idiotic title you give to those fluffies."
Cami L.,"Roseville, CA",67,12,,5.0,3/17/2016,"I love this place. Friendly service, good food, and well if you like cheesecake, who wouldn't love the 20+ different flavored?!?!"
Nicholas L.,"Rocklin, CA",11,117,29,5.0,10/25/2014,"Yum! The headache here is just out of this world! I literally just bake special trips here just to buy the cheesecake!  I have never had a bad experience here. The wait is normally not to bad, and the staff is pretty friendly. The bathrooms are clean and comfy! The food is great! Be sure to watch the calories though!(if that's is something that you normally watch). But try their fewer calories menu! They have done great selections on there!"
Charlie L.,"Roseville, CA",245,249,273,5.0,11/11/2014,"I love coming here for brunch, lunch, dinner amd happy hour. The servers are very attentive from start to finish. My husband I always order the half chicken Madeira and steak Diane for $18. We usually don't have enough room for dessert so we always take it home. The facility itself is cleaned which is a big plus. Lunch service is a breeze I always know they pull through when I come in and pick up or sit for my preordered food..I work retail and sadly only have thirty minutes!"
Brandon L.,"Elk Grove, CA",65,389,373,4.0,7/13/2015,"I always enjoyed the food selection at The Cheesecake Factory. They serve burgers, pasta, pizza, tacos, breakfast items, and other delicious types of food.  Of course don't forget the cheesecake. They have tons of variety of cheesecake from fruit ones to sweet ones. Of the times I have been at this location service and food was good. Line can be long at time especially on a weekend so wait times might be high. They have lots of seating inside and some seating outside. Right next to the Nordstrom so it is very convenient from the mall. If you are looking for a section of food, The Cheesecake Factory is a great place for it."
John F.,"Vacaville, CA",61,72,10,4.0,9/20/2014,Great service and attentive waitress and waiters. The Kobe Thai burger is so delicious. My waitress was able to provided me garlic fries instead of regular. The food Is high quality. Timeliness is quick. I'm happy for the service.  The reason why I mark one star off because they forgot to provide a birthday dessert for my daughter after mentioning it to them twice. But overall great experience.
R C.,"Fairfield, CA",32,47,103,4.0,2/10/2015,"The name says it all!  However, their entrees are excellent as well.  The price range truly reflects the size/portion as well as quality of the entrees = Not Cheap but Not Expensive as well. My favorite is the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta = YUM!  Mouth just waters whenever I think of this entree.  Although, be advised, their food is made to order (i.e., not reheated or micro), so there may be slight variances from each locations, but all around awesome. For dessert, have at it - cheesecakes of all the sort!  I don't have a sweet tooth but love looking at them.  My wife and kid can eat sweets for me."
Sherryl Z.,"Roseville, CA",206,117,186,5.0,7/31/2015,"Came with 3 friends and their kids and it was National Cheesecake day. We ordered off their skinnylicious menu and the food is so good! Their menu is huge so there's a lot to choose from. Too much. So I don't know anyone who can say that they can't find anything to eat at this restaurant. The kids enjoyed their food too. Mac and cheese and corn dogs and fries and chocolate milk. Can't go wrong! I always order the strawberry martini. It's my favorite. My favorites salad is the pear and endive salad. The service was excellent, our server was Christian. He was so patient with our children too. And the number one reason why we came was for the cheesecake! Omg the best ever! We orders 8 cheesecakes!!! I love this restaurant!"
Dalene N.,"Sacramento, CA",48,14,4,5.0,12/21/2015,My grandmother and I went in after a long day of shopping. Adam (our server) was wonderful. He was swift and attentive. The zucchini fries were amazing and my filet was cooked just right with the most amazing scampi sauce for my shrimp. This was a satisfying end to our long intense day. Thank you for sending us home happy!
Richard P.,"San Jose, CA",3,250,,2.0,6/12/2015,"Richard Pro here with another review. Cheesecake Factory looks incredible. That's a given. Your servers are professional. Booths are comfy. The interior is stunning, but lighting could be more generous. Portion sizes are extremely reasonable . . . but when we talk about taste, that's where Cheesecake Factory falls flat. The dishes are overly greasy and buttery. The flavors are usually overkill with sauces that are too heavy or creamy or tangy or whatever. There's no fusion of flavor, there's just one overpowering element in any dish you order that kills it.  The cheesecake is exceptional, but at $7 a slice, I don't think I can stomach it.  Won't return on my own, but it's a nice place to catch up with friends."
Lemoura G.,"Vacaville, CA",10,34,21,5.0,1/2/2015,"I ate here a couple of days ago with my husband. We had the crab and artichoke dip (so delicious) as an appetizer. For our main courses we had 1) Tempura Fish Tacos (so good) and 2) Chicken Tortilla with a sweet Tamale Cake. For desert, we had the Kahlua cheesecake and the red velvet cheesecake. Both were incredibly. Our server Ashley A was fantastic. She was very attentive and gave great recommendations such as the Flying Gorilla.  We have always had great experiences at this Cheesecake Factory. :)"
Lovely L.,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",3,56,3,5.0,11/21/2015,"Tim was our waiter and he was beyond exemplary. Full of personality, was really nice to my kids and even complimented us on our parenting, since the kids behave well in restaurants. Drinks were never left empty. The food was AMAZING. Every single item we ordered was more delicious that I could have expected. Hell, even their iced tea was to die for! LOL. We didn't order dessert, but will come back again another time."
Samantha L.,"Sacramento, CA",294,553,1160,4.0,8/9/2012,"This Cheesecake Factory is really like any other CF: big portions, decent flavor, decent price, fair service.  The one thing I can say that really makes this one stand out though, is their water-refilling habits.  I usually don't refill my water if I know that I wont finish what is already in my glass. Seeing my half full glass, I had four servers come by and offer to refill my water, literally within a 20 second time frame.  It seemed kind of silly at the time, but I guess I appreciate that attentive service. The food came out pretty quickly too."
