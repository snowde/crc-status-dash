Cheryl S.,"Los Angeles, CA",54,603,22,4.0,9/4/2014,"We came here on a recent Saturday night and had a good experience.  We were told the wait was about 20 minutes and it was.  Our server was friendly and kept our water glasses full.  Our orders came out correct.  The food was good.  I might even call the chicken burrito I had very good.  My daughter enjoyed her pasta with butter and parmesan, but it's hard to mess that up!  I'll give it 3.5, but round up to 4."
S S.,"Roseville, CA",0,20,3,5.0,2/3/2016,"Good service and good, but pricey food. Expected though. My water glass was never empty! Our waitress was on her game I have to say. Spent about $55 for two of us. Bread is served with your meal too. I didn't know that. First timer. We had the buffalo blasts for an appetizer. I didn't count how many came on the plate but I want to say 10? $11.50. Soda was 3 bucks. Bacon bacon burger $13.95. Spicy chicken sandwich $12.95. A slice of cheesecake was $7.95 (Range from $6-$8) I had the salted caramel cheesecake. Pretty awesome:) Nice experience. Thank you, Antoinette! I'll be back one day when I have an extra $55 to spend and leave a better tip."
Cartrina C.,"Roseville, CA",71,23,11,5.0,11/6/2015,One of my favorite places to eat! I love love the firecracker salmon and the hibachi steak. It's on the expensive side so I only go there on special occasions.
Charles N.,"Rocklin, CA",0,19,2,1.0,2/23/2015,"I'm really sorry to have to do this, because all of my prior experience with cheese cake factory has been great.  To begin with, they somehow put our reservation on ""hold"", meaning that they had called our name but we hadn't responded. However, we had been sitting or standing right in front of the hostess station the entire time.  So instead of the 20 minute wait we were told in the beginning, it turned out to be closer to 40. It was still a 20 minute wait after we cleared that up. I think this mixup was in part due to the young females hostesses spending far too much time chatting with each other- something management needs to pay attention to.  The very worst part and the reason for the one star. Service was excellent, the food came promptly. I ordered the Shepherds Pie, and it seemed to taste ok. However, within less than an hour I was home and terribly sick. Not to be rude but it was coming out of both ends if you catch my meaning.  Unfortunately I've had food poisoning before, and I know exactly how it feels. It could only have been that shepherds pie- I didn't eat any appetizer before except for the bread, which was shared by two others who didn't get sick."
Paige Z.,"Loomis, CA",1,43,27,5.0,7/13/2014,"Cheesecake Factory is always fun, love the decor and atmosphere. Last I went was for a Bachelorette party with 13 people on a Thursday night! They accommodated us quickly and our server, Edgar, was INCREDIBLE. Excellent drinks, fresh-baked bread before food, Large main dishes. Even the appetizers could be a meal! And of course the cheesecake is to die for, especially the white chocolate raspberry. If you're just looking for cheesecake, no worries, there's a little space in the lobby to admire and purchase a slice or cake."
Roman G.,"Stockton, CA",72,38,14,4.0,10/16/2014,Great place went here on a business dinner and everything was great from the food to the service. The restaurant is beautiful as well. I had the Shrimp & Chicken Gumbo and it was plenty of food. Haven't had the cheesecakes yet but I've heard they are delicious. My only complaint is how I was here for a business dinner so I needed my receipt but the waitress didn't return my receipt or my change which was only some change. And when I asked for the receipt she made it difficult to get and still did not give me my change. Which I then did not tip her beside the change she didn't return to me. Overall it was a great experience.
Stephanie F.,"Stockton, CA",96,32,15,1.0,5/6/2015,"The SLOWEST service I have ever experienced. It took over 2.5 hours to eat and leave. Don't plan on getting in and out with a party of 6+. The place wasn't even crowded. There was no wait to be seated.  To top it off, my mother's food was cold. Not a great way to celebrate a birthday. Will not be back."
Sophia T.,"Roseville, CA",15,42,37,5.0,6/15/2014,"This was dad's request for Father's Day! Love Cheesecake Factory!! We were seated promptly and our waiter, Mike, was very nice and attentive. You'll never run out of options with their menu so whatever you are in the mood for they've got, and if you're still unsure they have specials on top of their regular menu too. Oh! Don't forget to try some cheesecake - YUM!"
Janice B.,"Citrus Heights, CA",2,7,2,5.0,7/30/2015,"I got the kobe burger and requested it medium rare only to get the burger to find that it was too well done. When I requested a new burger, my server Jaquelynn was very empathetic and responded quickly to my needs. A manager, who I didnt get the name of, came out and checked in with me as well, apologizing for the mistake. The staff here is kind and wonderful and we will definitely be visiting again. THANK YOU!"
Jake H.,"South Lake Tahoe, CA",3,116,109,4.0,11/19/2015,It was my first time at a Cheesecake Factory and I was surprised how good it was.  I came for lunch and had the thai glazed salmon and it was great.  Wait staff was quick and friendly.  Did not have cheesecake because I was full.  I'll be back it was great
Alec M.,"Tracy, CA",17,153,32,3.0,3/28/2014,"Cheesecake Factory is ever-reliable when it comes to finding something I like. This past visit I wanted a salad, and their Cobb (the size of a hubcap, swear to god) hit the spot perfectly... and an even bigger plus - it was very lightly dressed, perfect for a warm spring day. Pair it with their awesome iced green tea and a seat out on the patio, and it's some kind of paradise.  The service I received wasn't necessarily attentive, our server was much more occupied with the table of obviously wealthy women next to us as opposed to the my group of twenty-somethings. If there's one thing I hate, it's when people don't take me seriously because of my age.... sigh. Our food was good enough to overcome that, but it's still a concern."
Jennifer N.,"Roseville, CA",40,114,90,4.0,10/11/2010,"I love coming here for any occasion! They have a wide variety of food, drinks, and desserts! I love their Grilled Portobello Mushroom burger with a side of mixed greens. And their desserts are YuM-My! The Rye Bread is awesome!! Super good all the time! My favorite dessert is the Raspberry Lemon cheesecake. They also have Low-Cal food menu as well! Try the weight management Grilled Chicken: Lightly Pounded Chicken Breast Charbroiled and Topped with a Tomato and Arugula Salad. Garnished with Steamed White Rice and Asparagus. Under 590 Calories. Substitute the white rice with Brown Rice. Yum!"
Hayley S.,"Grass Valley, CA",0,2,,5.0,1/10/2016,"This was my first time at the Cheesecake Factory.  To say it was a great experience is an understatement.  We were quickly greeted by our waiter, Hank. He was friendly,kind and, quick . We started by having avocado egg rolls, they were to die for and piping hot ! Shortly after we were brought our food. Which was delicious and again hot and fresh!  We finished our meal off with cheesecake, which again was absolutely delicious . The mango key lime was amazing !  Unfortunately, I do not live close to a Cheesecake Factory. But now I know this is the place to go!  Highly recommended . Great staff, great food, quick service .  Great way to end a long day of working a bridal show!"
Ellen R.,"Gilroy, CA",13,43,6,5.0,10/17/2015,"What can I say? Awesome experience! Had the pleasure of having John B wait on me. I was really confused with what I was hungry for. He offered many suggestions (he obviously loves the food here) and I ended up picking something completely opposite of his suggestions... Except for... The lemon meringue cheesecake. It was just as he described- like a lemon bar!  Ask to be seated in his section and you will have impeccable service, fast refills, and an all-around great experience!"
Chris G.,"Rocklin, CA",15,122,16,4.0,8/15/2015,"This is a great place.  The prices are 15-25% more than a Chili's or equivalent...but this is a nicer experience...and the food is 100% better.  I have never had bad food or service from this place.  I have gone there so many times, and it is such a regular experience for me, I give it a 4-4.5...it's really good, and pretty quick.  Lettuce wraps, lettuce tacos...orange chicken is THE BOMB!!!  Burgz...it's all good!"
Psalm F.,"Roseville, CA",0,12,30,4.0,11/17/2015,"This chain restaurant is one my go-to whenever I'm at the galleria mall. This restaurant provides you with huge portions, so the price does compensate with the amount of food you get. But be warned about the wait, especially on the weekends. It can take up to an hour and half wait. Their cheesecake still lives up to its reputation. Love the red velvet and the white chocolate raspberry cheesecake! I usually order the chicken and shrimp jumbo! They give you a decent amount of meat, but not proportionate to the size of rice they give you. I also recommend their bang bang chicken and shrimp! Has a unique taste, definitely love the coconut flakes! I would also recommend their scampi pasta if you're not a fan of heavy tasting food."
Natasha L.,"Roseville, CA",2,29,,5.0,3/5/2015,"Absolutely love this place. I have been going here for years and food is consistently yummy. They make the best avocado rolls, chicken de pana and believe it or not chicken samosas. For date night we get their steak diane and salmon combo and it is perfect with a glass of wine. I regret that we are always so stuffed to have their cheesecake but the few that I have tried are so creamy . I also like that they let you eat at the bar when they are busy."
Kyra P.,"San Diego, CA",0,42,,5.0,6/11/2016,Jennifer is a great waitress and makes you feel like you are her best and only customer.
Jessica G.,"Sacramento, CA",3,35,38,3.0,6/5/2015,Food was great service was ok. They were busy because of graduations. I had ordered an app for my meal and when the girl brought it out I had asked her if the other food was coming out too. She said yes while rolling her eyes. We didn't receive bread and the server said they only bring it if it's requested. This is my first at the Roseville location. Red velvet cheesecake the bomb .
Soloman A.,"Hayward, CA",3,18,21,1.0,6/3/2015,"If your skin is a few shades too dark you're gonna have a long wait to get a table here, 1 hr to get a table while larger parties had 15 min wait times"
