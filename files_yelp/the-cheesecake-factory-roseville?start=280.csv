Jolisa J.,"Roseville, CA",9,20,2,4.0,9/30/2014,"We had a friends birthday here last week. The hostess set us all up with a great table away from most of the people in the restaurant which was above and beyond what we all expected! The waiter was very pleasant but the food took a little long for the amount of people that where in there that day. We really didn't have that big of a party either, maybe 7 of us and we didn't order anything crazy. Im sure it wasn't the waiters fault, but perhaps he could have put a little pressure on the kitchen staff? Overall a good experience."
Fancy N.,"San Francisco, CA",175,132,47,1.0,8/8/2015,"This place was super packed and super busy. The wait for us was about 30 minutes. When we got seated we got our drink order. Bread wasn't brought to us until 30 minutes of sitting down. Our server looked as though she forgot to put in our food order after seeing the look on my face. We waited about an hour until we got our food. It was already late and I wanted to eat quickly and take my 5 yr old home but since the service was horrible and it took forever to get our food, we canceled our plans of getting dessert there. Food is great here but the service was horrible."
Alexandra K.,"Chico, CA",0,1,,1.0,5/4/2015,"I went to the Galleria Cheesecake Factory for lunch this past Saturday (May 2, 2015) with 2 of my friends. We ordered the avocado egg rolls as an appetizer, which were good. Then I ordered their mushroom chicken lettuce wraps as my meal. When my plate was delivered, there were multiple bugs (very small) crawling all over the lettuce that was served with my meal. I immediately had the waitress return the plate to the kitchen, and did not order an additional lunch plate. As someone who is ServSafe and HACCP certified, this is incredibly alarming and a clear indication that this establishment is not following proper procedures and protocol for their food preparation.  The waitress had the manager come and apologize for the ""inconvenience"". The manager did not seem genuinely apologetic for the incident, and did not make an effort to rectify the situation. Generally, restaurants with excellent customer service would offer some form of incentive to return to the establishment after an experience like this, but the manager did not.  This poor customer service and clear lack of food safety precautions will result in me not returning to this establishment. I also intend on writing to their corporate office to let them know about this experience.  I would have expected a lot more from a restaurant that charges as much as they do per plate."
Lisa W.,"Orangevale, CA",25,16,3,3.0,10/19/2014,"I ordered the BANG-BANG CHICKEN AND SHRIMP and my hubby the GRILLED RIB-EYE STEAK.  The BANG-BANG was a bit mild in taste. The grilled ribeye steak what my husband says ""was fine"".  Of course we ordered cheese cake.  This by the way, was the only reason we ever order anything from The Cheesecake Factory.  The first cheese cake was CHRIS' OUTRAGEOUS CHEESECAKE.  While it really wasn't a cheese cake and seamed way two sweet, it came as expected (size of piece without whipped cream and as pictures on websites look).  The second cheese cake was white chocolate raspberry truffle and seamed about half the size of the other, had whipped cream on it( even though we asked that it not have any).  Flavor was there for this and it too was a touch on the sweet side. Now we ordered this to be picked up curbside and that went wonderful.   The had a guy stationed out in the pick area just waiting for people to show up.  He was nice and took our info down and brought out our food in no time.  This service was amazing and very helpful.  Price for the quality of food you get is horrible,  it should be about 30% cheaper.  Our total bill was 75 bucks.   Over all if I did not have this gift card from last Christmas I would not have been a happy camper."
Jenny M.,"Elk Grove, CA",58,29,36,1.0,3/2/2015,"I'm usually a fan of Cheesecake Factory but my dining experience today was just horrible. First off we asked how long the wait would be and the host said about 15 minutes so we're like ok that's fine. But no, we ended up waiting around 40-50 minutes.  But that was just whatever. We got seated and got greeted by our waitress and her name was Emily. We were already ready to order when she first came and after that she never came back to our table. She didn't even bother to come and asked us how everything was tasting and such. Another server had to refill our water when they brought out our food cause our cups were literally empty. She was also serving the table right next to us and every time she came to their table and asked them how everything was doing I made eye contact with her but she just literally ignored me. She even had time to refill their water and clear their plates and even got them a box. We sat there for about 15-20 minutes just waiting for her to come by again to get her attention . She finally stopped at our table and asked us if we needed any boxes. I believe this is one of the worst dining experience I've ever had.  And also I asked for more bread but it never came either."
Aww S.,"Eureka, CA",39,19,14,2.0,7/30/2015,Brunch on a Saturday in the bar area. Got the Baja Mash and could barely eat it. Do not recommend it. 7$ mimosas for about 6 ounces. Not worth it. Won't return
Sonia J.,"Sacramento, CA",0,3,,1.0,2/22/2016,I've been eating here for over 15 years off and on and last week I bit into a 2 inch long metal piece in my lettuce wraps...I'm scared to go back!
Samantha W.,"Cupertino, CA",8,23,5,3.0,7/22/2012,"Not too bad, not too great. Cheesecake Factory definitely topped my expectations in terms of service, but just met my expectations of food (excluding the cheesecake, of course!).  Ambience is one you'd expect from an American food chain restaurant. Dimly lit on the inside with a mediocre sound level. Not quite formal, and not quite homey. Our server was very nice and friendly, so no complaints there.  A tip on their food - their avocado eggrolls appetizer is absolutely delicious! It is a must try on anyone's dinner menu. All other foods are so-so, nothing quite so memorable. Cheesecake is delicious as expected, but I'd have to warn that I'm a rather boring eater sometimes. I always go for the original cheesecake (or the strawberry topped one), so I wouldn't bet on my cheesecake experience as a reliable review. Overall, I'd say it's a nice place to catch dinner before or after shopping, but it wouldn't be a place I'd go out of my way for."
Jimmy H.,"Sacramento, CA",29,223,21,3.0,5/26/2015,"Took way longer than was quoted to get seated but once we finally did get in there, everything else was pretty good. I got the Mac N Cheese Burger, which was amazing and just as bad for you as it sounds, with a fried mac n cheese ball and the whole thing coated in cheddar cheese sauce. They actually cooked the burger to medium rare which seems to never happen when I order it. My wife's pasta was on the bland side though and the prices were a bit high overall. Not sure I'd return any time soon, but it was decent enough for an evening out."
Lydia K.,"Rocklin, CA",441,416,164,3.0,2/16/2012,"Went for my sister's birthday with a party of five of us.  I called ahead for reservations.  They do not take reservations BUT THEY WILL (according to the girl on the phone) take phone ahead seating.  Well when we got there the host told me they don't do that either.  I was put off because on the phone she said they did and she took my name.  The host was gracious and said he would get me in soon and when they seated us about 10 minutes later he said they seated us sooner and sorry for the mis-information.  I was peeved but they did make an effort to make up for it.  Please don't give me mis-information in the future, it just doesn't sit well with me. THE FOOD:  I ordered the seared tuna salad for $16.95.  Considering the huge portions that the Cheesecake Factory is know for I was expecting a good amount of tuna for the price right?  Well I was very dissapointed with the 5 very thinly sliced pieces about 1x1 1/2 inches each.  Also, the picture online shows sesame crusted tuna, this only had a spicy seasoining that tasted just like Tony Chachere's which was too much.  The dressing was tasty and overall it was edible but dissapointing.  I would not order it again. My husband had the BBQ salmon with corn succotash and mashed potatoes for $15.95.  He loved it and it was a big portion.  I tasted the salmon and potatoes and both were great. The other three enjoyed their meals but I did not taste them. I didn't hear them saying they were particularly wowed by their meals and one said the food was overly salty... We had cheesecake for dessert and I remember the slices being larger in the past, especially for $6.95.  Not worth it. The service was excellent and timed pretty well. As we were leaving, on the way out the hostess said, and this is an exact quote:  ""Thanks for leaving... I mean coming in.""  LOL we laughed for a long time with that.  She laughed too and when we joked we wanted her name she covered her name tag the entire time!  It was sooooo funny."
Jenny H.,"Sacramento, CA",53,13,,1.0,1/20/2015,"My issue isn't with the food or waiter but with being overcharged and having to chase down the support staff to get it resolved. I split the check with my sister and we both used credit cards and signed for the split amount. When I checked my account a few days later, I noticed I was charged for the whole bill. The amount I signed for was voided out and my card was charged for the full check amount without my permission. This is incredibly disturbing and I feel extremely violated knowing that it doesn't matter what I approved to be charged, because they can charge whatever they want in the end. I have gone into the cheesecake restaurant with my receipt and made 4 follow up phone calls and this still hasn't been resolved. There is no sense of urgency or desire to get this resolved on their part. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone especially if you're planning to use a credit card."
Katelynn S.,"Orangevale, CA",21,17,14,5.0,3/2/2014,"This place is amazing!!  My boyfriend and I came here for lunch on my birthday. It was also president's day so the mall it is attached to was pretty crazy. The lobby looked busy, but we only waited for about 5 minutes. Our server, Mike T, was very accommodating and friendly.  We ordered: Buffalo Blasters (appetizer) - these are little fried wontons full of shredded chicken, cheese, and buffalo sauce. They are honestly one of the most delicious things I have ever eaten, and the boyfriend and I crave these things daily now! Fried Zucchini (appetizer) - these were for me since my boyfriend doesn't eat vegetables. I'm a huge fan of fried zucchini, and these were the best I've tried so far.  Fettuccine Alfredo (meal) - probably not the best fettuccine alfredo I've ever had but it was still pretty good. Crusted Chicken Romano (meal) - this is basically like chicken parmigiana. Breaded chicken breasts over tomato cream sauce and noodles. It was pretty good as well. Pineapple Upside Down Cheesecake (dessert) - couldn't have asked for a better tasting birthday ""cake"". I love love LOVE pineapple upside down cake so this was perfect for me.  Honestly, this place has a great atmosphere, great service, and delicious food. The menu selection is enormous, so there really is something for everyone. The cheescake, no matter what flavor you get, is delicious. Highly highly recommend. Anyone leaving bad reviews is most likely just another snob from roseville who can't be pleased. (: Go here! You won't regret it."
Amy C.,"San Francisco, CA",765,844,932,4.0,10/13/2009,"Three reasons why you should revisit the Cheesecake Factory:   RED.   VELVET.   CHEESECAKE.   That's right!  In the spirit of American ingenuity (and obesity), the Cheesecake Factory's newest cheesecake flavor features 4 alternating red and white stripes of moist red velvet cake and creamy cheesecake.  It is generously covered with a thick layer of artery clogging cream cheese frosting and prettily decorated with sugary frosting curlicues along the side.  And of course, the plate would not be complete without a tall tower of whipped cream.   GOD.   BLESS.   AMERICA.   p.s.  Your cheesecake experience will be greatly enhanced if you bring along someone who HATES being sung to on his birthday and casually drop within earshot of your friendly server that it is said person's birthday.  The hue of the birthday guy's face will go well with the red color of your cheesecake.   p.p.s.  The Cheesecake Factory now prominently displays the calorie information for their cheesecakes.  DON'T LOOK!"
Christina S.,"Redding, CA",18,10,5,1.0,12/22/2014,"The husband and I stopped in for a slice of peppermint bark cheesecake after some last minute holiday shopping. We let our server know we would be there simply for a slice and placed our order.  Over 30 minutes later I finally walked up to the counter to order my own since we were clearly forgotten. The cheesecake I wanted, a seasonal item, was sold out yesterday!!! Not only did we wait around for far too long but for an item they didn't even have.  While we waited another couple at a high top table waited forever for the same server to approach them with menus and take a drink order. I spoke with the manager who apologized and wanted to do something to make it up to us but that's not the point...time at the holidays is a precious thing and ours was wasted. The hubby still hasn't had Cheesecake Factory and at this point why bother."
S F.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",128,259,271,3.0,5/17/2014,"Came here for lunch with my coworkers. I got chicken Madeira. It was good and hit the spot. I also got a piece of cheesecake.  Raspberry truffle, good but I think I will get a different kind next time"
Joy J.,"Northern California, CA",241,337,79,4.0,2/28/2015,"INCREDIBLE menu.  It goes on and on...you almost need to study it before you get here!  Waits can be very long, and the restaurant is definitely NOISY.  Food has always been good, as has the service.  I would recommend trying to eat here when they might be a little less crowded?  Like a very late lunch or a super early dinner?"
Shelly B.,"Middletown, CA",3,102,355,4.0,4/1/2014,"We've eaten here several times.  Recently were celebrating our daughter's 18th birthday, there were five people in our party.  We ordered two appetizers, everyone ordered a dinner, and then we ordered four deserts.  Our bill came to $190!  We didn't even order drinks.  Three of the people had water to drink, the other two had iced tea.  We would eat here again, but we'll probably limit it to special occasions."
Angelica R.,"Lincoln, CA",114,3,,5.0,4/28/2016,Amazing customer service got exactly what I wanted tasted amazing was having a ehh type of day and 2 employees made my day 1000x better thanks guys
Jim W.,"Mather, CA",1,3,,1.0,11/25/2014,"Food was okay, but very disappointed. My son lost one of his front teeth on the bread. His tooth was not the least bit loose before going there. We complained about it and the manager gave him a small bowl of ice cream. It was very poor service. I am not one to complain let alone write a review, but we don't ever plan on going back. A close to $200 meal, a lost tooth over super hard bread, and no offer for even a slight discount."
Camilla F.,"Rocklin, CA",36,25,8,5.0,7/3/2015,"Huge portions, great server, fancy ambience without being snooty. Only con is very pricey, but worth it for the amount and taste of the food."
