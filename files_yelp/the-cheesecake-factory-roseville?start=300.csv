Gerrie N.,"Granite Bay, CA",22,44,13,5.0,6/28/2015,a great happy hour place.  Lots of variety to choose from with large servings.  Great also for families and of course  don't forget the cheesecake '
Michelle B.,"Fair Oaks, CA",117,197,58,5.0,1/27/2014,"I started coming to this Cheesecake Factory location a few weeks ago. I've been here several times now and every time the service is absolutely wonderful, especially Heidi, and the serving sizes are plentiful. Plus, I feel the entrees are fairly priced. Depending on the mood I am in, going healthy or cheating on the diet, there's something for just about everyone. 1st visit I had the Beets & Goat Cheese Salad, it was surprisingly plentiful and filling. If you're also getting an entree, I recommend sharing the salad. I recommend asking for extra apples.  However! When I mentioned it to the server that they should up the apple quantity in the salad, she actually called the manager over, so I could share my comments with the manager (made my opinion feel really valued). I spoke with Ron, wonderful guy, and he absolutely agreed. In fact, Ron said he asks for extra apples on his own salads too. So, it is possible that they may, in fact, have already started serving it with additional apples!!! 2nd visit, I ordered the Buffalo Hamburger, but I ordered it protein style (with a lettuce wrap). When it came out, it barely had any buffalo hot sauce or blue cheese crumbles. I let the server know and she said originally the kitchen had goofed and they made it on a regular bun, hence my condiments were probably stuck to the bun. She quickly sent out a hearty bowl of extra buffalo sauce and blue cheese crumbles and the manager Ron delivered them. Again the manager was genuinely interested in my feedback and getting to the bottom of the issue regarding the lacking condiments. The burger was perfectly cooked, how I requested (medium-rare), and very good!  3rd visit, we had a big group and we were looking for appetizers and dessert. We ordered the Chicken Nachos which were HUGE. We had 4 kids and 2 adults and there were still some nachos left over. We also ordered the calamari, it was very good. Not the best I've ever had, but good. As well as we ordered the deep dried Macaroni Balls, these were a great hit with the kids. For dessert, we split 3 cheesecakes among 6 people. Smores', Dulce (caramel), and New York Plain Cheesecake. They were all equally wonderful, but how can you go wrong with cheesecake?!? Beverages: their hot chocolate is incredible! One of the best blends I've ever had. I will definitely be back."
Kyla F.,"Payette, ID",27,66,11,4.0,5/9/2015,"Normally I give Cheesecake Factory 5 stars but the service was iffy at this location. Food was excellent, I had the Luau salad, Peach Bellini, and Toasted S'mores cheesecake. Everything took very long to get and the server didn't check back often. I would go again and hope for better service."
Lisa B.,"El Dorado Hills, CA",64,308,68,3.0,3/14/2014,"Don't take my table! Happy hour here rocks-- 4-6 pm in the bar only. $5 appetizers (full size)-- including their famous avocado egg rolls (it's the tamarind dipping sauce that makes it tasty!). Having been to multiple Cheesecake Factory locations, the quality of the food at this location seems a bit lacking. The server we had for HH (a gentleman) was awesome and came back to check on us before 6 pm if we wanted to add anything. Would recommend the Factory Nacho's. For $5, it can feed a family!"
Kelley H.,"Grand Forks, ND",158,82,153,3.0,12/24/2014,Good service and I use to love the food here. I now have to eat GF and their gluten free food does not taste good. I am sad to say I will not be able to go back.
Debbie A.,"Grass Valley, CA",0,2,,5.0,10/11/2015,"Our party of ten had the best dining experience here. Waitress Jessica A. was amazing and awesome. Her service was excellent, the food superb, and OMG!!!!.....the cheesecake was delicious! Would definitely return to the Roseville location and would definitely recommend!! Can't wait to go back."
C P.,"Sacramento, CA",9,19,4,5.0,3/15/2016,Ate here tonight. Our server Kat was absolutely wonderful. Some of the best service we have ever received. Brought in our 1 year old that loved her. She went the extra mile the whole dinner. We will be back. Thanks for the wonderful service.
tina p.,"San Ramon, CA",225,223,28,4.0,3/22/2015,"Came here for a business dinner in late January. Hadn't eaten at a cheesecake factory in probably close to a decade. The avocado eggrolls were just as delicious as I remembered. Had the Salmon Genovese, asked for broccoli instead of green beans. It was delicious! Paired nicely with the Kim Crawford sav blanc. Service was good, and wait wasn't too long (though it was a Wednesday night around 8pm)."
Jess R.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,24,4,5.0,8/25/2015,"Celebrated  a Birthday  recently at C.C.F.  and it was terrific!  If you have not tried the Smors Cheese Cake you are missing out, a must have. Waitress was great as usual and the food delicious."
Steven J.,"Shingle Springs, CA",0,17,,5.0,4/30/2016,"I don't like waiting but once in it's worth the wait! These guys clearly understand the value of teamwork! From check-in to the table to the kitchen, everything is well orchestrated and the food comes fast and always tastes great!"
Rachel B.,"Rocklin, CA",1,32,5,1.0,10/29/2014,"Went to the location in San Francisco and had bad service so I should have known not to come here. The restaurant it's self is clean and nice on the inside but you can barely see. Kinda like the inside of Abercrombie and Fitch or hollister no lighting. The wait was not long on a Tuesday evening. We got sat in about 5 minutes. Sadly our server seemed very rush and in a hurry and didn't know a lot about the alcoholic drinks/menu. The whole time we felt like she had no time to give to us if we needed something or to take our orders. We first ordered a salad which came out incorrectly. Then our actual meals came out which seemed like really small portions for what your paying for. Not worth the money at all. My steak and potatoes were cold, my moms pasts was pretty mediocre and my sisters pasta was super greasy. I am not a complainer but I expect a good meal coming to a restaurant I can live with bad service but please make the food good! Finally we ordered dessert which was cheese cake. Honestly I can say that was ok. The portions are pretty big and the presentation looks nice. So they did one thing alright.  I must say cheese cake factory needs to work on there customer service and Learn how many tables to give a server so you actually get good service. For what your paying for drinks, a meal and desert which comes out to be around $150 for four people, they really need to have better service. In the San Francisco location same thing, service was very bad."
Katherine G.,"Elk Grove, CA",19,71,310,5.0,8/28/2013,Excellent service and the food was on point. I ordered the mushroom burger and the bf got the spicy chicken jambalaya pasta and for dessert we tried the banana cream cheesecake. Yummmmm!
Sandra And Barry G.,"Rocklin, CA",46,6,1,2.0,12/23/2015,"Ate here for dinner with my husband, we both ordered pasta, before we even made it out the restaurant we both were sick to our stomachs - food poisoning. Something just wasn't right with the food. Food was hot when it came out, but didn't sit right. We won't be coming back."
Cindy K.,"Folsom, CA",208,1066,517,4.0,8/1/2011,"Last Sunday was the National Cheesecake day. Did you go get your half-off cheesecake??? Well I did and it was awesome. We went here for some lunch after shopping and D&B.  I admit, even though this place is amazing sometimes I don't want to come because I'm worried about what kind of service I'll get. It's a hit or miss. Actually this time it was sort of a miss. Our waitress took forever to come back and take our order. She was borderline rude/indifferent towards us. We asked her several times for break. It just felt like a horrible waiting game with her. Luckily her shift ended after we got our meal and we got a new and better waitress.  The bf tried the Renee sandwich combo. YUM! He even got their sweet potato fries. The soup that came with it was delicious. Tasted like chicken pot pie without the pie. I think there was too much mayo in the chicken salad and could've use more almonds. I got my usual, pasta da vinci."
Mark A.,"Sacramento, CA",0,18,3,2.0,4/18/2016,"Medium burger ordered and it wasn't cooked at all, flat soda and over all didn't even finish my burger and I finish a Big Mac from mc Donald's so there's prospective for you"
David S.,"Granite Bay, CA",0,16,1,1.0,9/7/2014,"I don't really even want to leave this review, because they will probably figure out who left it and spit in my food next time I'm there, but I just have to. My GF and I go to this place 3-4 times a month.  We really like it. However, it just needs to be said that Natalie is the absolute WORST waitress I think I have ever had.  I mean EVER. She totally ruined this place for us. So I order a cocktail and some bread to start.   After I drink it and we eat the bread, she comes back and asks if we want any appetizers.  I order another cocktail and a soda, my GF orders a beer and we ask for more bread.  She comes back later with my drink and a glass of water(?) ok, fine.  She said she's going to give us another minute to look at the menu.  She comes back with her beer and we order.  Now she has her hands just full of crap, so she doesn't write anything down of course.  She leaves (still no bread or soda).  We never see her again until after our food comes out (NOT like we ordered it, of course!).  She doesn't even bother to check on us, I had to wave her down and she literally rolled her eyes.  We couldn't believe it, right in front of us, gave us the craziest look ever for bothering her I guess.  Whatever.        So we're almost done eating and STILL no soda (or bread, but that doesn't even matter anymore).  Finally, she remembers and brings it out.  I'm pretty much done at this point with my meal.  Ok, no big deal.  Not like she's going t charge us for a soda that took an hour that was delivered when I had maybe 3 bites of food left, right? WRONG.  $2.95  right on the bill.  Whatever, I just want to leave.  Now. back to that bill.  This lady had the audacity to draw faces and crap all over the bill and even had the time to put hearts all around the SUGGESTED TIP part.  Oh hell no! Not for this crappy service!  No wonder she forgot the drinks, she was too busy trying to subconsciously pad her tips on people's bills.  It was so blatant, we had to post it on facebook to see if we were overreacting.  We weren't .  I used to work for tips, for a long time, actually.  I usually tip 20% even for bad service, just because.  I typically do 25-30% and that's why the bartenders know me everywhere, but I just couldn't this time.  I wanted to stiff her SO BAD, but couldn't.  I still left her 10 percent for some dumb reason,  which, I think I've now only done twice--EVER and I just pray I NEVER get her section again."
M. D.,"Roseville, CA",4,17,,4.0,11/14/2013,"OMG!  I love their Crispy Chicken Costoletta!  It's divine!  We've also tried quite a few items on their SkinnyLicious menu too and we always really enjpy the food.  Try their skinny sangria, it's so good.   We consistently have fantastic service at the Roseville Cheesecake Factory, however, we usually go during lunch hours.  Evening can be quite a wait, however, still great service."
Alex G.,"Pacific Grove, CA",26,41,10,5.0,10/3/2014,"How does this place have anything less than 5 stars...... Not sure there. I think the only way you could rate it anything less is if you hate cheesecake, huge portions and reasonably priced liquor! Always a favorite after going shopping at the Galleria."
Craig I.,"Folsom, CA",271,17,6,5.0,10/29/2013,"What can I say? I've been here quite a few times and I have no complaints. Incredible portions, good food, great customer service.  Even on crowded evenings the waiters/waitresses are helpful and, in my experience, pretty funny!  Oh and their cheesecake selection is to die for."
Donna S.,"Roseville, CA",623,709,1055,4.0,6/2/2013,Huge portions on the regular menu. Be prepared to take some home with you and feed the family.  I like the skinny menu side. The small plates are good becasue you can try different things.  The cheesecake is to drool for.
