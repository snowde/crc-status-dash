Troy M.,"Sacramento, CA",24,268,37,4.0,3/2/2014,Good food after going though the long long wait and big big menu. After dinner the mall was closed due to such long wait. Cheese cake was yummy too.
Judie S.,"Placerville, CA",0,2,,5.0,4/10/2016,"Just left the cheesecake factory at the Galeria. The food was as good as it always is, but I'm really here to give a shout out to the service. The place was packed, filled with hungry customers. But even with the bustling environment our server still made us feel special. They even fixed the air to accommodate my grandmother. 5 stars!"
Danny G.,"Roseville, CA",319,98,789,4.0,9/11/2014,"Pretty easy to get in on a Wednesday night. I've been here before on a Thursday night and had a pretty significant wait time. I believe it was 30-45 minutes. Tonight I took my mom out dinner. She had the lettuce wraps, wow this was a big portion plate. I asked if it was the sampler platter because it had many different types of lettuce and about 6-7 total, each one generously filled. She really liked her dish and plenty  leftover for tomorrow's lunch! I had the Miso salmon, a little bit smaller then what I usually get else where, and $2 more. However, it was Yummy...this was a very simple dish with great flavor, if you like it sweet. But then, who doesn't like it sweet  you get your choice of white or brown rice, I chose brown. They laid the Miso salmon over the bed of rice, then laid snow peas around the bed of rice.Next time I will ask for more snow peas, or maybe a side of veggies, because they only give you about 6 snow peas total. Finally, they topped it off with a tasty white wine cream sauce, yum, I'm almost ready for some more. We couldn't shut it down with out the cheesecake! Because we were stuffed, we decided to share a slice of the red velvet cheesecake. I liked it, but now I'm over it, it tasted more like a whipped cream cake, then the traditional solid cheesecake that I've come to love! Oh well, I'll try something different next time. Our waitress was friendly and very attentive, no frills, just got it done. I look forward to going back."
Karley S.,"Sacramento, CA",14,205,7,4.0,2/27/2015,Had the grilled fish tacos with a side of cilantro rice and black beans.  Very nice portion that doesn't leave you stuffed.  Also split the chocolate peanut butter cheesecake with husband.  Very rich but so delicious. Wait staff was professional and friendly.
Liliana H.,"Roseville, CA",12,25,9,1.0,8/26/2014,"I went to the Cheesecake Factory for my anniversary date with my fiancé and it was a huge disappointment. I used to love going to this chain restaurant that is loved by pretty much everyone and it is a disappointment I have to write a negative review.  We went around 9pm and it wasn't busy at all. We were seated quickly but after that it was horrible, slow service. Our waitress took forever to take our drink and appetizer order!  We got our appetizer- the Crab Wontons- which were actually delicious and ate them. It took us about 20 minutes to eat them and we realized the waitress still hasn't came by to take our order even though she walked by countless times. It was an additional 15 minutes before my fiancé had to flag her down. He ordered the classic hamburger and I ordered a Caesar salad with added grilled shrimp. It came out in a timely matter- but the food was nasty. My shrimp was dry and there was hardly any dressing on the salad. The dressing was also bland and I had to send my salad back because I could not eat it. The waitress then became very rude and had attitude. My fiancé also didn't finish his food- his hamburger was dry and tasteless. I was surprised how a chef could ruin a simple salad and hamburger. I am not sure this horrible service and food was because it was late and the employees were not having it- but I will never go here again. The restaurant I used to love going to as a kid has changed and I am very disappointed."
Daniel K.,"McKinleyville, CA",2,43,,4.0,9/16/2013,"As always the cheesecake factory is pretty consistent.  I guess this is the beauty of this chain.  No matter what restaurant you go to it always tastes pretty much the same.   My one complaint was that the Sprite I ordered was almost flat and I somewhat dislike the high volume banquet seating (however, this is probably on me as I suppose I could have waited longer for a booth). Service was friendly and attentive and the food was solid.  Yes, I will be back."
Michael C.,"Sacramento, CA",22,12,,2.0,9/19/2015,"Went here on a Thursday night with four other people.  I ordered the Vietnamese Shrimp Summer Rolls, huge fail.  There was 6 half rolls that looked like a five year old had rolled them, only 2 of the six actually had shrimp in them, This may have been a blessing in disguise as the shrimp still had the shells on them. Very disappointing. On the bright side, the sauces that came with them were wonderful.  For our entrees, three of us ordered the Steak Diane (all medium rare). One came out medium rare, the other two were medium well. All were horribly under seasoned.  About 10 minutes after we ordered we were informed that there was a shortage of mashed potatoes and were asked if there was a side dish that they could substitute for the mashed. I said that I wanted the mashed and didn't want a substitution. Another five minutes goes by and the waiter comes to our table to inform us that they now have found some mashed potatoes and all was right with the world, that is until I tried them and found that they had large chunks of uncooked potatoes in them (argh!).  The other person in our party ordered a burger and fries which wasn't too bad except for the fries which are large fresh cut fries much like In & Out Burger serves just a bit thicker.  And just like In & Out fries they are great when they are hot, but five minutes later when they cool off a bit, they become incredibly nasty. Over all the dinner was very disappointing, especially for the prices they charge. It looks like this will be our one and only visit to The Cheesecake Factory."
Cynthia M.,"Sacramento, CA",0,1,,2.0,4/3/2016,Food was good but the service was horrible. Never was checked on if we needed more drinks or napkins. I tried to get the waitress attention and I was ignored.  Will not be going  back because the service. The service not good wasand not up to par like other restaurants.
Kristy U.,"Shingle Springs, CA",202,98,63,1.0,3/23/2015,"Not the worst display of customer service however, our food was cold, after waiting for our waiter to bring us a second plate to share our entree' when we were told they had no problem slittin git for us originally. Our waiter was not overally friendly and I am not interested in returning."
Eric M.,"Lincoln, CA",57,32,2,5.0,8/13/2013,Always a great place to eat.  I have been to alot of the cheesecake factory restaurant chains and they never disappoint.   Food recommendation: appetizers-deep fried macaroni and cheese balls. entree:  chicken fettuccine alfredo dessert:  Godiva cheesecake
Kapehe G.,"Roseville, CA",0,7,5,5.0,8/7/2013,"EXCELLENT SERVICE!  We ordered curb side and the waitress was at our window as we put the car in park. They forgot a side salad which really wasn't a big deal considering our order for the office staff was huge. Still we thought we'd give them a friendly heads up of the minor oversight. Not only was Michael, the manager profusely apologetic, he offered us a $10 gift card which arrived within 1 week enclosed with a apology letter...CLASS ACT.  Consistantly Awesome service to match the already know Cheesecake Factory quality of food...Job well done CF- Roseville!"
Christina M.,"Citrus Heights, CA",115,201,249,3.0,9/8/2014,"I'm not usually a big fan of box chain restaurants but we stopped in after a night of shopping at the mall and I was pleasantly surprised. The service was truly amazing.. He was so friendly, fun and understanding that we had a 10 month old baby with us. I had the herb crusted salmon that was very tasty and cooked perfectly. My BF had the chicken chili over brown rice... Yummo. We wed both too full for cheesecake.. :-( I'd come back if at the mall and in a pinch."
Michelle H.,"Midtown, Sacramento, CA",60,11,,1.0,3/8/2015,"The star I gave is mostly forced, since there is no zero.  We chose Cheesecake Factory as the location for a small 80th birthday celebration for my Mom, and we had nothing but trouble there today. We were told 30-35 minutes wait (for 8 and a high chair). It was an hour and 10 minutes. Meanwhile almost all other parties were seated before us. I complained twice. By the third time, we were ALL pretty perturbed. They finally sat us, where we sat for over an hour before we got our meals. The trouble goes on and on. I had to go to the social station (oh, I mean the server station) to tell someone to send the manager over, but that was a joke. Nothing changed except that 4 servers brought our meals. After that, we went back on ignore. I can't stress how aggravating that was. With that many people extremely unhappy and very hungry before they even get seated, get out of social mode and GET TO WORK! Managers: you HAVE to develop systems to back your servers as well as run checkups on all sections! Servers need to be able to ask for help and GET it. Horrible experience. NONE of us will be returning. EVER!"
Jonny L.,"Folsom, CA",67,60,25,3.0,1/3/2015,"Cheesecake Factory is always hit or miss. I usually don't crave it but if someone's suggests it, I won't turn in down. This outing was a causal dinner with the fam. I know they usually take reservations but for this weekend they didn't (due to the holiday). This wasn't a big deal as we decided to go early and put our names down in case in was busy...It was of course but we had a lot of time to kill. It was a nice plus to see that instead of waiting with the masses inside the restaurant they give you the options of text messages while you walk the mall. The final wait Til was over an hour and half, no surprise there, but by that time we were just happy to get a table. Our waitress was surprise nice and super quick, got our bread and drinks out almost instantly. I had ordered the gumbo and my gf had the four cheese pasta (our go tos) and I forget what the rest of our party had. My gf and I both  enjoyed our dishes. The only one to not like his dinner was my gf's brother, however he is super duper picky and I knew once he ordered it he wouldn't like it..oh wells On to dessert, you can't go to Cheesecake Factory and not get a cheese cake or two. We ordered two, the pineapple upside down cake and white chocolate raspberry. I can't complain about either, both were delicious and a great ending to the meal.    The menu is a little overwhelming with so many choices. I understand they have some of everything for any craving, but I can't see not just me but others spending more time looking at the menu and wishing they just brought anything out. That's why my default is always the gumbo."
Janice S.,"Roseville, CA",2,12,15,2.0,8/19/2014,"I USED to love Cheesecake Factory until recently. Last  time I had gone, I had a less than pleasant experience. I had ordered the fresh grilled salmon and when it arrived it was just about raw. I told the server about it and he took it back to the kitchen. When he returned, it was then overdone and dry. That unfortunately wasn't the first unpleasant experience. It just seems the quality of food has diminished. I honestly don't think I'll be back."
Matthew F.,"Roseville, CA",37,6,,5.0,4/5/2015,Great food and great service. Perfect place for a great holiday meal. Fast and friendly service.
Yulfo L.,"San Diego, CA",48,78,29,5.0,12/1/2014,After a 7 hour shopping day this was the best place to be.  My mother and I dined our night away.  Our server was excellent and always checked on us even though it was so busy with the giants game on.  The food was up to par however one plate you can share with your mate since they have no portion control.  Also the cheesecakes are really to die for!
Randy S.,"Honolulu, HI",28,305,57,2.0,6/2/2013,"A LITTLE BETTER Second visit in 4 years. They earned an additional star. Bread was good. I had bang bang shrimp. Boring. Wife had the same. Boring. Sara had mac and cheese. Boring. The wait staff is nice, but you know what I hate? i hate when they ask ""How's everything tasting? Perfect right?!""  Its a pre-designed question made to minimize your ability to complain about anything. So I'm still not sold on Cheesecake Factory. It's not perfect by any means."
Sabrina B.,"Reno, NV",289,687,1508,4.0,9/15/2009,"Convenient location. Even on a Saturday afternoon we were seated immediately. Server was a tad slow but seemed to have quite a large section so we cut him some slack. Menu is huge but my fiance and I have our favorites so we don't need to browse too much.  Fried Mac and Cheese is amazing. Gluttony personified, but worth every delicious bite. Especially when washed down with a sweetened iced green tea. By the time our entrees arrived even the lunch sized portions we ordered were too big. Doggy bags!! Crusted Chicken Romano and Chicken Parmesan Sandwich. A slice of 30th Anniversary Chocolate Cake Cheesecake and we were off."
Jennifer P.,"West Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",22,21,3,4.0,1/21/2013,"My husband, son, and I took my mother-in-law to The Cheesecake Factory tonight for an early Birthday dinner. We ordered:  Shrimp Scampi  Cajun Jambalaya Pasta BBQ Cheeseburger w/fries Kobe Beef Burger w/fries It was all spot on, all of it was great (even if the Jambalaya was a teensy bit greasy; the spiciness & flavor made up for it).  We also ordered cheesecake & a strawberry shortcake for my husband...again, good stuff. As for the service...it was FANTASTIC!  Hank was our server, and he made my mother-in-law feel extra special, putting on the charm with her, having other servers come out and sing Happy Birthday to her, that kinda thing.  Is some of it a put-on, or is he just *that* happy of a person?  Honestly, I think he's just a happy dude that puts his all into the job.  Does it hurt with the tips?  Hell no. lol  He's really nice, though, AND thorough; he doesn't write anything down--how does he do it?  I can barely remember my own order.  ;)  He was speedy, remembered drink refills, and was always charming & funny while doing it. The food was good, but Hank was great.  He is a kick-ass server that knows what he's doing.  Give him a raise, Cheesecake Factory, or I'll hire him as my personal assistant or something....when I win the lottery!  Price- 7/10 Food- 9/10 Service-10/10"
