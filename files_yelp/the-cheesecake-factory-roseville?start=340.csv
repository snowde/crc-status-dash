Kyle G.,"Roseville, CA",30,24,19,1.0,8/29/2014,"Don't bother taking a family or a larger-than-four-people party for happy hour.  You'll be made to check-in AND wait if you want to even use the tables WITHIN the bar area.  Don't even get me started with the horrid look you get from the host who takes your name.  (Homegirl!  You're not Taylor Swift, so don't pretend to be above everyone else!)  Really???  Normally, if your party is big, that means you eat/drink more = more $$ for the restaurant.  (Trust me: my family eats ALOT.). So even if the happy hour prices are solid, we will still beat out any $ lost from alcohol based on the amount of food we eat.  What the heck?  So there's discrimination against families now?"
Stephanie S.,"Rocklin, CA",5,137,24,3.0,10/15/2013,"This place, like any Cheesecake Factory, is decent but always so crowded. I felt like the hosts could have been better. The person who looked like she might have been in charge didn't seem very warm or welcoming. As usual, the menu is overwhelming, so it helps if you already know what you'll be ordering. I got some mushroom, avocado, and zucchini plate, which I expected to be healthy, but when it came it was all deep fried. The description was a bit confusing and I thought only the zucchini would be fried. The sauces they provided were not great. Some kind if funky aioli that didn't go well with my food. I think I'll just get cheesecake next time."
Gerry H.,"Granite Bay, CA",0,8,,1.0,2/5/2016,"Curbside To Go is horrible!  Placed an order and was told 30-35 minutes.  At 40 minutes I called to say I was parked in Curbside Pickup.  60 minutes I called to say I was still waiting.  At 65 minutes they came out for payment.  At 70 minutes they brought my order.  Places can get busy and run behind, but the person on the phone should have better than an I don't care attitude and since it was the same person you'd think she'd remember from the previous calls and express a sense of urgency."
Lena L.,"Rocklin, CA",0,7,7,5.0,5/25/2015,My most favorite restaurant to go to.  I will even go there to eat all alone.  Chicken Caesar salad is wonderful and so is the chicken teriyaki.  Drinks are way too pricey though.
G-Espinoza P.,"Sacramento, CA",28,15,2,5.0,12/11/2014,"Everything was excellent, my brother treated me to food after work, and since I have never been here, we decided to sit at the bar, our bar tender/waiter was Paige. She was really sweet, and had a lot of knowledge about the menu, which helps a ton for someone who super indecisive, like me..  Food was fantastic! Service was great! I will be coming back!"
Katie T.,"Auburn, CA",101,73,77,5.0,4/4/2011,"Cheesecake Factory never ever disappoints!!  Everything I've ever ordered has been phenomenal! The service is always top notch!  The Herb Crusted Salmon I ordered on my birthday, served with some of the best mashed potatoes I've ever had, was heavenly. In fact, it was so good, that it required a special dessert that could match it's goodness. The Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake did the trick! Talk about heavenly!  Their house-made dressing are incredible! My favorite is the peanut cilantro vinaigrette.  The avocado egg rolls are my favorite appetizer! So unique and tasty!  The menu is like 30 pages, so even your pickiest friend will find something they like on it!  Also I LOVE how the minute you sit down and you have a young child with you, they bring some soft breads and sliced banana for them. Finally a restaurant that ""gets"" kids!  Love Cheesecake Factory!! Out of all the ""chain"" restaurants out there it is by far my favorite!"
Michell H.,"Fairview, OR",9,18,7,3.0,4/15/2015,"Went here for lunch with a co-worker. We sat in the bar area... Our server was friendly and quick to greet us but after that the service seemed pretty slow given the place wasn't terribly busy. We ordered heavy appetizers to share (sliders, avocado egg rolls,  sweet corn tamale cakes) The sliders were mediocre, the egg rolls were pretty good, and the table cakes were great! Food took a while to come out... Pleasant experience but not overly great."
A L.,"Sacramento, CA",267,336,741,4.0,5/18/2013,"A restaurant filled with pretty workers and pretty food! I've enjoyed everything that I've ever had at this restaurant, but the dishes that I liked the most were the bellagio chicken/pasta dish and their sliders. Their strawberry cheesecake is also worth  mentioning."
Adrienne S.,"Sacramento, CA",59,25,23,4.0,7/23/2014,"Went yesterday and I got the Louisiana Chicken lunch special. It was delicious. The chicken was so crispy while the pasta tasted al dente. Their lunch special price is about $4 cheaper than the regular price so it was worth it to me. There was so much, I had to pack some to go. The waiter was very nice as well. I believe his name was Mike or Mark? Not sure. But I ordered a soft drink with my boyfriend and we like to share, I thought it was nice how he put two straws in the cup. :) Oh yeah, my bf got the Southwest Chicken Sandwhich (if that's what it's called) and that was bombbbb."
Julia L.,"New York, NY",269,313,19,4.0,12/19/2012,Yummy!!! Oh if you know me you know i just love the Cheesecake factory. Always ALWAYS the avocado spring rolls... the best. AND the salmon with asparagus and mashed potatoes Service is always good - I know their trained well since I had a friend who was a waitress there so Yeah. All in all great service and great food Enjoy!
Brian G.,"Danville, CA",0,19,1,5.0,1/26/2016,"Awesome service from start to finish, food was good, and the staff was awesome. After a horrible attempted birthday dinner at the greenback Black Angus we came here for a ""redo"" and we couldn't have made a better choice! The warm crab dip was sooo good and the egg roll platter has something for everyone. If I could use only one word to describe this restaurant it would be professionalism since that was all I saw!"
Food C.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,103,,1.0,8/27/2014,Went back again on Sunday to give it another shot.  Ouch.  Two drinks and breakfast for two and it was 50 bucks.  $12.50 for a pint-sized margarita.  For real.  I left feeling bloated and the food is so salty that I can't believe it's legal to serve it.  It is a rip off and simply not worth the money.  The service was great but that doesn't make up for what they charge for drinks.  Your sweet and sour comes out of a carton.  And you use middle of the road tequila.  The CEO is laughing all the way to the bank...
Rico P.,"Loomis, CA",0,22,3,4.0,5/22/2013,I have done lunch and dinner and am overwhelmed by the phonebook sized menu 3/4 of which are 1100 calorie plates or more. I have since focused on the good part of the menu (dessert) and the great bar & specialty drinks making this my reward place for good behavior :)  Off the Dessert menu the chocolate tower cake is the bomb as is the godiva cheesecake. Swish either of these down with a Flying gorilla milkshake which is in essence a milkshake full of booze and u r good to go :) nice outdoor seating at entrance to the Galleria Mall  makes this a great place to chill on a summer eve and people watch
Bradford L.,"Antelope, CA",8,125,2,2.0,7/30/2014,Wife still likes the place so we keep going back. I ordered a shrimp dish and half of the shrimp were not cleaned properly. Shrimp poop is not a good seasoning. The next meal I had had some tomato slices. It is late July and tomatoes are in season. But not here. They were unripe and had no flavor.
Tiger B.,"Yuba City, CA",0,12,,1.0,6/16/2014,"Worst customer service ever. Wanted to try it out for the first time. Went in and said seat for two. Lady at the counter ask for our name and said it will be a few minutes. So we sat and waited. People who came after us came in and got they're seat before we did, sat and waited for another 15 min, hosted saw us waiting and didn't even say anything to us, will never go there agin."
Anthony K.,"Yorktown, VA",176,267,131,5.0,5/18/2013,Excellent meals as always.  Mike was a great waiter.
Sharon C.,"Rocklin, CA",46,113,28,5.0,9/12/2012,"Cheesecake Factory at the Galleria has been our go-to place to eat out recently. We have a 2 year old and an infant and the we've had some really good experiences there. We've gone twice in the past two weeks and were really happy both times. My son always gets the corn dogs and fries kids meal. The corn dogs are made from fresh in the kitchen, not frozen and heated.  On one night, my husband ordered the steak diane and they accidentally brought him a similar dish. We thought they changed the dish but the manager came out a few minutes later and apologized for the mixup (without us even mentioning it). We told him we were fine but he insisted on giving us the steak diane as a to go meal. I've been ordering the ahi tuna salad off the skinnylicious menu and I love it. The salad, tomatoes and avocado slices are always fresh. The tuna is great and I love the dressing."
Macee F.,"Roseville, CA",19,21,2,4.0,10/5/2013,"Had some good food tonight, along with delicious cheesecake! Our waiter Hank was amazing tonight, made our night very enjoyable! His service made this visit easy, comfortable and fun, when coming back, hope we get him again:)  Food was brought out good and efficiently, only thing that we didn't like was the clam chowder"
Brittney A.,"Roseville, CA",1,6,,3.0,3/7/2015,"I always love coming here because of the quality of the food. It's always fresh and tasty, the service is great! The only reason I'm giving in 3 stars is because it's really pricy, I know it's a nice place but it's 4$ for a soft drink and most entres are like 20$. I will go here for a special occasion or happy hour"
Marlo M.,"Roseville, CA",68,26,11,3.0,7/15/2013,"What can I say? I've been here quite a few times and I have no complaints about the service. The waitstaff has been consistent: Fast, very friendly, and not overly intrusive. I haven't had any issues with wait time either, and am usually able to get a table within minutes (granted, the last 3 times I've been here have been for weekend lunches). The food is fine. Their menu is humongous, so it's hard too choose what to order if you're the indecisive type. Usually I try to find the healthiest and go with that (which honestly isn't the easiest task - their food is calorie-packed). Of course the cheesecake is delicious. Cheesecake Factory is seldom my first choice in dining out, but when someone else wants to go there I don't complain."
