Crystal R.,"Elk Grove, CA",54,62,8,4.0,11/8/2012,"I love their skinny-licious menu!  Great customer service.  Even on crowded evenings the waiters/waitresses are helpful and, in my experience, funny!"
Samantha P.,"Wheatland, CA",0,12,,3.0,2/23/2015,"Enjoyed the service received at the cheesecake factory. Not sire how I feel about the overall taste of their food, I think because it is such a variety, they haven't quite mastered any one item. Definitely recommend it if you are looking for a place to eat with a variety of different people. Also, a good place to just grab some dessert."
Nicole B.,"Citrus Heights, CA",133,191,84,4.0,6/9/2013,The server was very friendly and knowledgeable. He continuously checked in on our table making sure our drinks were full and our food was good. I was very pleased with the service. The food was delicious all around. I got the skinnylicious spicy chicken salad and my friends got the skinnylicious santorini farro salad and the BBQ ranch chicken salad. The serving sizes were huge and the flavor was great. The only complaint I have is the prices. While the portions were large the prices were a big above average compared to comparable restaurants nearby.

Bella C.,"Middle Village, Queens, NY",0,15,2,3.0,11/5/2014,"The hype is more than what it is. It was my first time ever. I was super excited bc I have forever heard about how amazing the Cheesecake Factory is. I finally went and was disappointed. I guess it's bc they have a huge menu with a wide selection of basically any and all types of food u can think of. But the food is not 5 star at all. The locale is pretty nice and the waiters are nice also. However I can say that the mozzarella sticks they have are good, probably the only thing I thought it was good. They need to step their game up!"
Darryl R.,"New York, NY",0,351,12,4.0,2/9/2013,"The favorite chain for my wife and I to have a nice meal - here or out of town.  We pretty much stick to the lo-cal salads (which are great), and maybe an appetizer.  She loves the corn tamales and I love the avocado wraps (although not lo-cal by any means).  Then there is the cheesecake- which we served at our wedding and alway enjoy. This branch is better than most in service and average in atmosphere (which is usally good).  The place tends to be always crowded and parking can be a problem when the mall is busy."
Melissa B.,"Roseville, CA",81,8,5,3.0,12/19/2012,"Normally I love the Cheesecake Factory, especially this one, but today I was overly disappointed. Our waitress didn't stop by very often. The food took a while to come out. And most of all: THEY WERE OUT OF AVOCADO EGG ROLLS. I could have cried, they're my absolutely favorite. I got the Spicy Cashew Chicken. It was sweeter than I expected, and wasn't very spicy. It mostly appeared to be a giant mound of rice with some chicken, and I definitely don't need the carbs. Maybe it's because I'm sitting in the bar area or it's right before Christmas... But I will be coming back to test this theory!"
Jennifer S.,"Roseville, CA",641,207,2,4.0,1/23/2013,I've been to this location many times and the service and food is always consistently good.  It's a nice choice for a quiet date night or dinner with friends.  My favorite entrée is the orange chicken.   It's always tough to resist a big slice of cheesecake at the end of the meal.
Linda S.,"Rocklin, CA",7,63,,4.0,10/26/2015,"I love this place!  Always a great experience and the service is wonderful.   I just wish the menu was not so large, so many great things to pick from, I love it when I have lunch with friends they are never rushing us out, but we go during the week, so that must make a difference.   Try it, youll love it."
Phil C.,"Roseville, CA",2,31,,4.0,1/17/2015,Great chain restaurant. Service is good. I would say the best Mai Tai's' in town. Friends and family have came here at least 10 times in the past year. Cornerstone of the mall.
Louir B.,"Rescue, CA",0,4,,1.0,1/10/2016,"Most people give this place a descent rating about how good there food is. Well, that may very well true, But then there are the hostesses.  We drove all the way from Placerville to check this place out. The wait time was not to bad, about 10 minutes, will say that it was crowded, so the wait was acceptable.  But then the hostess seated us in a corner of the restaurant next to the waiters station against a half wall with no elbow room at all. Asked for another table and was informed that none was available.  We got up and wslked out, and went to another resturant, Mimi's and enjoyed a really good meal and much better sesting. Maybe that table location would not have been such a big problem, but when your 6'4"" you would think that the hostess would take that into consideration.  Will never return to this place again and will pass on the gift card on to the trash can. When you go to a restaurant where the prices are above the average price of comparable places you would expect descent seating, and better mannered hostesses.  Thumbs down to this place."
Ashley T.,"Bothell, WA",5,36,70,5.0,8/16/2014,"Julie K was our server, we walked right in after 11 an were seated right away. Service was excellent! We had coffee, which was really good. We ordered the lettuce wrap appetizer. It's huge, and SO delicious. It comes with chicken satay chunks, bean sprouts, carrot slices, cilantro, cucumber/red onion/vinegar mixture, and three AMAZING sauces, a sweet one, a spicy ones, and a peanut sauce. So fresh and tasty! I'd come back just for those wraps. All for around 20 bucks. Thanks cheesecake!"
Dale N.,"Stockton, CA",2193,720,6555,4.0,3/13/2010,"Celebrated a friend's birthday here tonight.. with a party of 15! They do not take reservations.  Arrived at 6:40.   Was told there would be a 1:45 to a 2 hour wait.   After about 15 minutes I talked to the hostess and told her that we volunteered to sit outside on the patio if that would mean that we could be seated sooner.  Within about 10 minutes they had our table set up under the overhang and within the range of the patio heaters.  There were other people eating outside.  We were not cold at anytime throughout the meal even though it was 50 degrees outside.  Kudos to the hostess for making that happen! I had: Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic - $15.95 (Bow-Tie Pasta, Chicken, Mushrooms, Tomato, Pancetta, Peas and Caramelized Onions in a Roasted Garlic-Parmesan Cream Sauce.) Fried Zucchini - $3.95 (Lightly Breaded and Served with Ranch Dressing.) Stefanie's Ultimate Red Velvet Cheesecake™ - $7.95 (Moist layers of Red Velvet Cake and our Original Cheesecake covered with our special Cheesecake Factory cream cheese frosting. 25¢ from the sale of each slice will be donated to Feeding America, the nation's largest domestic hunger-relief organization.) Diet Coke - $2.95 (Easy ice) The deep fried zucinni were coated with a light crispy, crunchy batter and served hot with a special ranch dressing dip.  The pasta was very good and cooked al dente. I would order that again, but most likely will try other menu items next time.  They bring baskets of bread, both brown and white..both are very good with endless refills! Our server, Brian, did an awesome job.  Was constantly checking on us to see if everything was satisfactory.  Kudos to Brian, too!  Note to management:  Give Brian a raise and promote him!!  An asset to your organization.  :) Fun place, good food, crowded, long wait...but I would return!"
Babs M.,"Loomis, CA",140,6,,5.0,8/24/2013,"Took my son for an early afternoon dinner and treat. We were seated right away. The decor is whimsical. I love the fact that most of the tables are semi-private. My son wanted a bacon-cheeseburger. They didn't have one on the menu, but they created one just for him. He was thrilled. He said it was the best he has ever had. And that kid eats them everywhere we go. He was able to bring home half for lunch today. I had the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp. It was excellent. I am looking forward to having the leftovers for lunch today. Our server was polite and calm. She took excellent care of us.  The best part was the S'mores Galore Cheesecake. We got one slice to share. We still brought home a third of it. I love this place!"
Jasmin R.,"Chico, CA",0,6,,3.0,11/2/2015,"For being a first timer at this place it was a no go. First, our server didn't not introduce herself or what was the menu of the day and was never around. Second, our drinks had WAY to much sugar and our pasta was not cooked all the way. I wish we would have had a better experience. Dessert was good other then all that."
April C.,"Rocklin, CA",195,121,130,4.0,3/28/2014,We can't say to much about the food because we only go late at night for the sweets and coffee. You can't go wrong with almost 4 pages of sweets and coffee. Our servers are always hilarious! It's makes the whole experience worth it. I love Chris's Outrageous cheesecake!
Ben S.,"Rocklin, CA",2,51,80,4.0,12/12/2014,"The strawberry shortcake is damn good. It's big and for two but I could eat the whole damn thing. Love the entrees here too, looking forward to eating here again"
Mymy N.,"Roseville, CA",604,628,1062,4.0,6/20/2012,$5 drinks and food for happy hour! (3-6PM) I love the large selection too and they stay true to their large portion sizes. The grilled artichokes were on point and probably the best appetizer that we ordered. I liked the cream cheese wontons but I wish the dipping sauce was sweet and sour sauce. Guacamole is bomb! Super filling. The pink lemonade cocktail is perfect for summer too.
Pawankumar H.,"Folsom, CA",24,62,70,3.0,5/10/2013,Francis Coppola with fried artichoke. Good service and the artichoke dishes are recommended at this place.
J T.,"Citrus Heights, CA",1,37,,2.0,9/27/2014,"Two stars is an average of our last three  visits.  First time we went for dinner and were knocked with the food and service, everything was great and we looked forward to our next meal.  Went for lunch a couple of months ago and were seated immediately, that was nice and the service was good, food - so so.  I guess I was expecting too much from a cheeseburger but my husbands grilled salmon was also  overdone. Today we walked in to a nearly empty restaurant and were seated at a tiny table for two with one chair out in the aisle - seriously?  Guess we disturbed the group of   girls up at the front but asked to be moved to a different table anyways.  The hostess said 'I'll  see if I can find something"" - excuse me, the restaurant is empty, no?  She brought us over to the other side and sat us at an identical table.   We walked out and will not be returning, there's too many restaurants around there serving adequate food with a much better attitude."
