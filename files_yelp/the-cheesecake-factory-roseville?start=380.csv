Nicole C.,"San Francisco, CA",30,39,,5.0,8/14/2015,"I went in just for a quick drink at the bar. My bartenders name was Natalie. She was quick, friendly and super sweet. She seemed to know most of the bar clientele as well. I hope when I come back she is working!"
Deidre M.,"El Dorado Hills, CA",120,63,32,1.0,7/11/2014,"I ended up with gluten, dairy and beef in my mouth when I ordered specifically!!!!  Ok it was turkey. Thank God for Ron J Mgr!!!"
Sundiata C.,"Sacramento, CA",1,41,,2.0,10/25/2014,"Came on a Saturday night and of course it was very busy. Their service was good but the wait times were a little long. One of my friends had cold fries, but they brought out hot fries for him after he told the waiter. I ordered the stuffed chicken tortilla. I thought it was was going to be like a quesadilla but it was more of an enchilada. The corn cakes were very good though."
John D.,"Lincoln, CA",0,1,,1.0,3/18/2015,"This was my second time to the cheesecake factory in roseville,ca. my wife and I was invited to dinner by my union boss to celebrate my retirement. My boss said I could go anywhere we wanted and I chose cheescake factory over Ruth Chris because my first experience was great and it was reasonably priced. Wrong move! I ordered the ribeye steak because on my first visit the ribeye was superb! I said ribeye medium no onions. I got what looked like ribeye soup. my steak was drowning in what I call liguid au jus because being a meatcutter for 47yrs there no steak that gives you a cup and a half of natural juice. I ate the steak to not cause embarrassment to my boss. In all fairness the other two meals said were good. I love a great steak with no au jus so i'll just pay premium and go to Ruth Chris. I won't be comming back here."
Michelle R.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,18,,5.0,7/29/2014,"Excellent service, clean and great food. We went to this Cheesecake Factory 2 days in a row. The waitresses were super friendly, the service was fast and the food delicious. One of the best if not the best Cheesecake Factory we have gone to."
Joanne L.,"Granite Bay, CA",280,542,47,4.0,3/22/2010,"Perfect for St. Patrick's Day! No lines! No wait! I decided to try to be healthy and ordered the turkey burger.  It was so amazing... it tastes great, it was tender... and I could only eat 1/2 because I filled up on the delicious bread and butter here. I was so full.. but the turkey burger was still awesome the second day. I would get the turkey burger.. next time... and the time after that.... turkey burger FTW!!! I also got to sample some of their delicious Shepherds pie and it was really yummy!!! Except it doesn't really fit in with my new ""diet/lifestyle"" but highly recommended!!!  okay for cheesecake... I wouldn't get cheesecake at the Cheesecake factory.  Their cheesecake is totally overrated... Please get the cheesecake at whole foods... it's a smaller slice... but just the right texture and taste!!!"
Diana W.,"San Francisco, CA",73,413,48,3.0,7/25/2010,"OK, OK, it's a chain-I know.  This one is no different than the rest, but really-their menu is so much fun, I can't knock it off my list!  (Shhhh, I go to the one in Brentwood and the one at the Grove sometimes-it's our secret!) Had the tuna salad on toasted brioche (a move from my fav-the steak Diane/chicken Madeira combo) and it was humongous as usual.  Hit the spot as my sister in law was trying to make this trip a night out at a ""high end"" restaurant.  (Yes, she is a little sheltered). All in all a great, easygoing meal that left me wishing I'd had a salad ;) Go for it when you want some lovin' from the oven like mama used to make....Ciao!"
Jenny B.,"Sacramento, CA",98,338,42,4.0,12/21/2011,"Service was fast and excellent. Went on a weekday night. Our server and all the staff we ran into were all cheerful and attentive, the way it's always supposed to be. She answered all my questions about everything. Portions are huge. I was surprised by the sheer volume of food that was on my plate considering the description on the menu. Not that I complained. Ended up taking the majority of it home to finish up. Lots of variety on the menu. They have almost any variety around the world so this is the spot to hit up if you want a nice atmosphere that's casual yet on the classy side. Oh, and the cheesecake is excellent. Grab yourself a slice."
Mindy D.,"Washington, DC",331,642,596,2.0,3/1/2010,"Where can we eat on a Saturday night at 8:30pm?  After much deliberation, we decided to dine at Cheesecake at the Galleria.  This place is huge and it's almost 9pm, there shouldn't be a wait, right?  Wrong.  Even at 8:30, the waiting area was jam packed with hungry patrons anxiously waiting for their tables.  We were told the wait is 20-23 minutes for a group of five.  Lucky us, we were there 15 minutes when they buzzed us.   The bread was hard and a bit stale... Hm?  Our waiter was not friendly at all and a bit stand-offish.  I can't remember her name!  She stopped by twice, to bring us water and take our orders.  She would check in on the table next to us often but not our table once.   Had I not waved her down, she would've walked right past us.  RUDE.  Food took a looooong time to arrive, but it was still delicious, of course.    All in all, I understand how busy and insane the place can get, but seriously?  Rude service is never acceptable."
M C.,"Roseville, CA",0,10,6,2.0,8/15/2015,"Been to this location plenty of times, food is always pretty good but the service is so hit or miss. The server we had last time was super sweet and attentive and I wish I could remember her name because she was awesome. Tonight, not so much.  Our server was friendly and was able to answer a couple questions about the menu, but we barely saw her the whole meal. When she was actually at our table, she was always in a hurry to run off and forgot anything she didn't write down. Waited ten minutes to order drinks, waited another ten to actually get them and when she dropped them off she put them all on the edge of the table and ran off before we could say a word. That's not a huge deal but really? Food took longer than usual and we weren't able to get more bread/refills because she didn't come back until some of the food was out, and learned only then that one of the entrees was missing. Asked for bread again, and again, and finally got it as we were leaving. I get it, it's a Saturday night and it's busy, but honestly tonight's service just felt lazy and the lack of it turned what should have been a 45 minute dinner into at least an hour and a half.  I like this location and will probably return at some point, but I can't say it's ever been one of my favorites for visits just like tonight's."
Nicole A.,"Orangevale, CA",1,8,,5.0,3/25/2014,"They have an awesome new gluten free menu! To anyone who is searching for real, edible, tasty options that you rarely can find out at traditional gluten-ed restaurants. They have gluten free appetizers, entrees and desserts! The hot fudge sundae is as delicious as they describe, but beware it's massive! I love their pomedoro pasta, and am looking forward to trying their appetizers next time."
Ginny M.,"El Dorado Hills, CA",0,1,,3.0,12/28/2014,"Had to request silverware and were informed by wait staff that they were having a ""silverware crisis"" and she would see what she could find.  She came back with 3 forks for a table of 4. Asked if we wanted butter knives too. We said ""yes, since we were spreading the butter directly from the little packets, and she responded ""well, that's what I do! OK I will see if I can find v you some."" I have never seen a restaurant of this size run out of silverware!"
Gregory B.,"Carmichael, CA",0,2,,2.0,10/2/2014,"Not so good anymore! service was ok but the food was really not good. I used to always like their meals but this last time, I ordered cashew chicken and boy, I spent the whole next day in the bathroom (: I had the same ordered in the past many times with no problems. this last one did basely have any cashews in it. other orders were poor as well. They were good when they were busy but now quality is bad maybe because they are too busy. Will not go back."
Robert F.,"North Highlands, CA",120,18,27,2.0,4/23/2014,"FIRST TIME:   Man, I really hoped that our first time here would have been so much better. ....  The husband and I have wanted to try this place but we were waiting for the hype to fade. ... Been here in our area for a few years.   We asked for a table w/chairs, we were taken Straight to a booth. ... our waiter was good, ordered the pretzel crusted chicken & Fried mozzarella for appetizers. ....  Both were just ok, a bit greasy on both... but well seasoned.   I orded the macaroni & cheese ball burger.... I know sounds crazy but it is right up my alley. .... I ordered it well done. ... it was charred on the outside.   But.... I must admit I ate it.... The burger was pretty good, it came with choice of fries or salad..... I chose fries and ordered them extra crispy. .... As the server put our dinner on the table she said ""on shoot, you ordered the fries crispy""...... We did not let her take them back cause our burgers were already served.  I dont think we will go back.   We did order two slices of cheese cake to go. .... Why would you go to the Cheesecake Factory and not try the cheesecake????  We will have to update on how they are a bit later.            All in all, I was not the least bit impressed with this place.   They are over priced and portions are really small.  At these prices I expect to have something to bring home to the kids..... (GRIN)"
Binh D.,"Roseville, CA",334,626,133,5.0,12/14/2011,"I love gluttony and variety so I love The Cheesecake Factory (TCF). TCF is corporate, huge, not specialized in it's menu and portions so big even most large Americans can't finish what they order. It's almost anti to everything that most Yelpers rave about. But for most people it's a great restaurant and I agree. Food: If you can't agree on one type or genre of food, TCF is perfect because it has pretty much everything and there is something for everyone. Ambiance: An upscale yet casual place full of families and couples that's good for a birthday dinner, first date or a quick meal. Only hang up, is parking can be difficult especially if the mall is busy. Service: Servers are friendly and fairly knowledgeable considering all the items on the menu. The bartenders at this location are great too. Price: $10 - $30 depending on what you order, but more then likely, there will be leftovers for your next meal. Overall: There's a reason there is always a wait. Near the mall and can't agree or decide to go, TCF will work."
Rochelle R.,"Sacramento, CA",219,84,55,5.0,8/30/2011,"SAVED THE DAY! My friend wanted her 30th birthday party of 18 girls to be at the Yard House which just opened down the street (doesn't take reservations).  She didn't make reservations, however, she had all of us going there at 7pm on a Saturday night with her husband there at 5pm reserving the table for us.  Guess what - the Yard House couldn't accommodate us. It's now 6:30pm on a Saturday night and we have 18 women heading to the Roseville area from the bay area, foothills and Sacramento.  WHAT TO DO? We called BJs Restaurant - nothing. We called The Cheesecake Factory in the Gallaria and spoke to this wonderful manager that said ""well I wont have anything available until about 7:15p and it would have to be outside."" Well, what he didn't know is we wanted outdoor seating and waiting 15 minutes was nothing!  WOW I was in shock!  We sent the husband over there to show the manager that we were serious about 18 people and BAM they made it happen! I feel so bad that I don't remember our servers name but we had ONE server for 18 women and OH MY GOSH she was FANTASTIC! I upgraded this 4 star review to 5 because our server was amazing!  I've never seen one server serve a table of 18 PLUS other tables with such grace and skill!  She was never late on anything, nothing was wrong with the order, the drinks came out in timely fashion... she was awesome!  The complimentary cheesecake for our birthday girl was an added treat and we loved the outdoor location! The Georgia Peach drink is super yummy! Thank you again to our amazing server!  We were there on August 6 and you were AMAZING! Thank you again for accommodating our group.  I also forgot to mention that our server did separate checks without us asking which was even more of an amazing quality!"
Chris B.,"Sacramento, CA",68,191,6,3.0,5/28/2012,"Reading the menu is like reading a damn novel. I'm pretty sure they have everything you could possibly think of on there, but it is so hard to choose from so many options.  I chose the enchiladas and they were good, but looking at everyone's meals I kind of wished I had chosen something else.  The waitress was super nice but very cheesy. Like she was trained by watching Office Space...minus the flare.  By the time I was done with my meal I didn't have room for a cheesecake, so I didn't bother. Next time I will probably just order an appetizer and a cheesecake!"
Vanessa F.,"Sacramento, CA",1,5,,2.0,8/29/2015,"The only thing good about this place is the very sweet, kind workers. Their cheesecake wasn't too bad either, but for $8 a slice, I could have gotten an entire cheesecake at Safeway that tasted better.  The atmosphere was like a badly decorated Vegas casino- and just as loud! No offense, if that's your style. It's not mine.  We ordered several things to try just because the menu was so huge there must be something this place excels at, right? Wrong. The food is WAY overpriced for the mediocre crap you get. The broccoli was not even steamed correctly. It was like crudités that sat in the back of the fridge for a couple weeks until they were kind of limp, then warmed briefly before being served as ""steamed veggies"". The pasta was ""eh"", the potatoes sucked, and the appetizers were gross. You know how Chef Ramsay always says pick a limited menu and excel at that, because you can't be good at a bunch of random items? He was right. I wish he would do a Kitchen Nightmares episode at The Cheesecake Factory. I can't believe people actually enjoy eating here. I can't believe this place is still in business. I'll never go back unless I hear that they have refined the choices on the menu and really put quality first. It's such a shame because the staff there was so nice, I'd give the service 5 stars, but the food was just awful."
Tim M.,"Lincoln, CA",8,40,,5.0,10/23/2011,"This chain is so solid , with the highest level of customer service and the best quality of food, that I think they may often get taken for granted. Yes, they are a chain, but their ability to consistently deliver excellent food and service is nothing short of magic! Especially in Sacramento where most restaurants are SO inconsistent, and often disappointing.  There is NO place you can order such a wide vareity of palate pleasing food at such (relative to the quality) low prices!  Most of the time I order my personal favorites, lettuce wraps/scampi/pizettes/steak diane which are always excellent, but tonight I tried their chicken and shrimp gumbo with andouille sausage. The flavor of this dish was indescribable, but simply delicious! The combination of different flavors were truly like a party in my mouth, I realize this sounds silly, but if you've ever been so fortunate you know what I'm talking about! Every taste bud on my tongue was lit up and sending back signals of mouth watering pleasure to my brain. I could not eat this fast enough, yet I paused several times just to relax and enjoy the wonderful flavors! All I can say is that the Cheesecake Factory provides 100% satisfaction, and if your not satisfied just let them know, and they'll make you something that WILL satisfy you!"
Raymond M.,"Granite Bay, CA",0,36,23,3.0,5/4/2014,Their food is awesome! The Navajo burger I believe it's called. Is pretty good! The cheesecake on the other hand.. Not so much. Good place to eat though! I come here every now and then!
