Annette H.,"Rocklin, CA",79,262,618,4.0,7/9/2016,"Nice location, beautiful interior. We received a generous gift card from a family member last year so we've been going to this Cheesecake Factory off and on to use up the balance. The menu is HUGE and takes a while to read through.  Since my husband just had oral surgery, we needed super soft foods so we figured soup and cheesecake might be the way to go.   Got a clam chowder bowl to share (which was a HUGE bowl!!).  It had a lot of big pieces of clam.  Pretty good.  Maybe a little on the saltier side but maybe that's why they give you bread. Husband got the California omelette, which didn't come with any additional protein so he opted to add chicken.  We also substituted the breakfast potatoes for mashed potatoes instead (since those would be easier for him to eat without chewing too much).  We didn't know this till the end but that ends up being a pretty pricey omelette at $13.50 plus $3.50 = $17.  Glad we had the gift card! I got a Cobb salad with honey mustard on the side.  It was great!   We got a bunch of desserts to-go to use up the gift card:  red velvet cheesecake, lemon raspberry cheesecake (recommended by our server), Godiva cheesecake and the chocolate layer cake (not sure the exact name).  The two chocolate desserts are amazing.  The other two, not sure we'd get again.  They were just ok. Servers were great, food was good.  Only downsides are the prices can be high (our entire meal cost us around $90, including tip!), AND they are super busy on Friday evenings and weekends.  Our wait on a Friday evening was about 20 min, which wasn't too bad but as we were leaving around 7:30pm, the place was packed with people waiting.  This location seems considerably smaller than the Arden one. I'd come back again if we got another gift card, and I'd try to come at off-peak hours to avoid the crowds.  :)"
Krish L.,"Sacramento, CA",0,12,42,4.0,9/4/2017,"This place is awesome, I love their desserts, drinks but the main dish I ordered were just okay. It's kid friendly and the ambiance is really good. The waiter who served us was very friendly and accommodating."
Tonya L.,"Sacramento, CA",1,21,,2.0,9/28/2017,"We stopped in for lunch today. This restaurant is usually one of our favorites because of their awesome menu and typically great food but it has been awhile since we've eaten here. Today was a game changer. The service was fine but the quality of food has gone down and the prices have gone thru the roof. I almost always order the Factory Chopped salad which is considered an appetizer salad. That salad, which was $8.95 not long ago is now $13.95!!! The turkey burgers we ordered had no taste and they were the size of a very small sausage patty. So disappointing. The salad that came with it was a small handful of spring mix with dressing. This ""salad"" consisted in nothing else. So we had one soda, a kids macaroni and cheese and two turkey burgers for a grand total of $40. I wish we had gone to Yard House honestly. We won't be back here."
Elen M.,"Rocklin, CA",11,2,,1.0,11/11/2017,Food is great but service is horrible.  I will try to avoid this place in the future.
Amy P.,"Sacramento, CA",34,14,1604,2.0,12/27/2016,Tonight was my birthday and they still charged for my cheesecake and we just paid & left because we didn't want to fight it.  Also the Factory Combos with Steak Diane aren't worth $21+ - they give you very little food and leave you unsatisfied.  Service was alright but I would never return to this place...
Maria P.,"Carmichael, CA",21,14,15,5.0,7/31/2017,I tried the celebration cheesecake today and the flavors are really good I enjoyed it but if you're craving real cheesecake don't get this one. The layers are a mouse type of a consistency like the description says whereas a regular cheesecake is dense. I enjoyed the birthday cake vibe of this cake it's really good! The cake layer is moist and gives the mouse layers another texture. My current favorite and has been for a while is the Key Lime Cheesecake!
Lillian K.,"Sacramento, CA",19,82,101,3.0,1/5/2017,"I was slightly disappointed with this place. The Moscow Mule was great, food tasted okay; I think the food was slightly overpriced for the bland flavor and the service was kind of slow for an average Wednesday night.  My biggest disappointment was the fact that I ordered a rather large dish for myself, with the intention of bringing my leftovers to work the next day for lunch. I only hate half of what was on my plate, and also saved an entire serving of black beans untouched specifically to take home with me. When I asked our server for a box so that I could take everything on my plate home, he insisted to box my food for me, so I said okay. I was disappointed today to see that only half of my food was actually boxed, and the entire bowl of beans that was on my plate was nowhere to be seen. I've had a little too many ""unpleasant"" experiences here to care to come back.  Do keep in mind that this was mainly server error and mediocre tasting food. I have some friends who absolutely love Cheesecake Factory, however, I'm not a fan."
Shelly F.,"Marathon, FL",35,12,6,2.0,3/11/2017,"The spider web really didn't make me want to eat   The potato soup was lukewarm, the alfredo was super hot. So not consis My friend ordered a shrimp bistro that she said was delicious."
Alexandra P.,"Elverta, CA",2,29,2,1.0,10/24/2017,"Since I am new to roseville I decided to try the Cheesecake Factory. The hostess named Sam was extremely rude to me. I asked her a question just for clarification about the bar seating. She replied with, ""that's what I just said."" And had an extremely bad attitude toward me. I will not be returning."
Matt B.,"Lincoln, CA",0,31,26,4.0,8/16/2017,If you can make your way through the 40-page menu you will find something you like. Always something good always something new.
Edward W.,"Sparks, NV",2,53,113,5.0,11/29/2016,"Eat here all the time. Bre is a very efficient bartender. Vietnamese rolls to die for, but they were out tonight. Great bar for quick dinner and watch the game. Kerry has great team."
Ed M.,"Granite Bay, CA",12,83,,5.0,7/1/2017,"Great menu. You can not go wrong coming here. Love the food, drinks and dessert. Had a curry chicken that was awesome and my wife had Parmesan chicken which was great. We ordered the crap and artichoke dip to start and it was to die for. All in all great place."
Mina Z.,"Folsom, CA",239,68,93,5.0,12/20/2016,"The Cheesecake factory made my birthday dinner absolutely perfect. Came in with a party of 7, only had to wait about 15 minutes, then we were seated in a great, quiet, comfortable location. Our server, wish I remembered her name,  was wonderful! She was on top of everything, refills, food, checking in, grabbing boxes.  Then the food came out, absolutely delicious and cooked perfectly! Everyone was so happy with their food.  Finally, they sang happy birthday to me, gave me a cheesecake with a candle in it and wrote happy birthday on the plate in chocolate syrup, it looked beautiful!  We all left very happy and I'm so thankful to the cheesecake factory for making my birthday dinner perfect! I'll be back next year!"
Mary J.,"Rocklin, CA",0,5,,2.0,1/5/2018,"We went there on December 31th 2017 just to have our last dinner for the year. It was obviously busy as expected. The waitress was super helpful, smiled and checked on us every few minutes despite the busy work; thus the 2 Starr rating. Food was nothing to write home about. The chicken was burnt, the hamburger patties were over cooked and dry, my daughters pizza pepperoni pizza were so dry with edges folding and burnt. Our bill came to $155.00 and I tipped the waitress $20.00. She was awesome. We asked to package our food after we all took few bites and decided it was horrible. As soon as we hit the packing lot, we found a trash can and dumped it all there. We had an order to go for my hubby we brought it home for him there were 3 pieces of shrimp and about 6 pieces of chicken in the shrimp and chicken pasta meal. We chose not to complain to our waitress because she had no control of how bad the kitchen performed but she knew that we were displeased with our orders. We have been to the Arden location prior and love the food there. I have pictures of our meals. ."
Christina B.,"Sacramento, CA",15,131,393,4.0,5/21/2017,It's always busy here but the food and service is good. I would make reservations for sure before coming here. You have to try the Nutella cheesecake!! That was the best part.
Carole Y.,"Carmichael, CA",0,15,2,5.0,10/12/2017,"We have not been Satisfied with Arden Cheesecake but today we decided to venture to the Galleria. Very satisfied with the service. The hostess was very attentive  And our service was excellent. When we asked for her option she were very truthful because what she recommended was what we ordered.! Great choice, glad we came here ."
Rachel J.,"Woodland, CA",31,4,5,1.0,8/2/2017,"If I could give a 0 I would. I ordered my food through DoorDash and there were lots of problems. First my food showed up 40 minutes passed the latest Tim I was given and I also had to walk a mile to meet him because he couldn't find where I lived. Now here comes the problem with the food, the food is room temperature! I am missing my sauce(I know this because I worked at the Cheesecake Factory in sac and have ordered this many many times)and my free bread that I told them to put in there, twice, my sour cream is slightly cooked and not has runny and chunky parts I am SO FREAKING MAD BECAUSE I WAITED FOR THIS FOOD FOR 2 HOURS AND PAID 17$!!!!! I am a poor college student so to me that is a lot more than McDonald's. I will never do this again!"
Bradley V.,"Rocklin, CA",40,60,25,5.0,4/22/2017,Great service and food tonight. The fish and chips were great with the IPA beer. The omelette was very good as well.
Vitaliy A.,"Roseville, CA",27,91,278,4.0,3/21/2017,"The cheesecake restaurant is pretty OK, if you want to lunch or dinner... if I want salmon then I will go to Cheesecake Factory ... I think they're the best one who cook salmon fish.."
