Myrna M.,"Buckeye, AZ",45,4,,5.0,1/4/2012,"We have eaten here several times over the past few years and it continually proves to be our favorite Cheesecake Factory location.  Today was the best ever!  The food was superb and the new Skinnylicious menu has very tasty items for anyone wanting the skinny on calorie count. Sara served us and pulled out all the stops to make our visit memorable, down to the warm damp napkins on a plate to follow some fingertip appetizers.  She even talked me into trying a new cheesecake, the Raspberry Lemon Tart Cheesecake, although I had been resolved to pass up dessert in exchange for a second glass of Chardonnay. We had a lovely time in the sun on a balmy January afternoon.  It is a great spot to relax and converse after shopping the Galleria."
Karen M.,"Vacaville, CA",3,7,,4.0,6/24/2014,"Had dinner here on 6/23. Check in was awful, wait for service even longer and food came out cold. Manager came out to apologize and we thought that was it but he stepped it up and surprised us with picking up all of the bill! Was so impressed with his generosity. Because of this will definitely go back again"
Jocelyn T.,"Roseville, CA",2,7,,5.0,8/13/2014,"I've always heard great things about this restaurant, and I can honestly say that I too am going to say something great. The atmosphere is sophisticated and fun, the service was super friendly, and the good was amazing!"
Annette C.,"Citrus Heights, CA",4,18,11,4.0,10/17/2013,"The Baja tacos were good tonight and I tried the pecan pumpkin cheesecake, yum! Husband liked that he could see the baseball and football games on the bar tv's from our table. It can get pretty loud in here though. My family left full and happy."
Sparkle H.,"Redwood City, CA",0,15,,5.0,11/16/2013,"We all LOVE the CKF!! I've never had a bad meal there.  My favorites are the Taco Salad from the skinny menu, and the Mushroom Burger from the regular menu.  The burger is amazing....very slightly pink in the middle, the beef has the most delicious flavor.  Smothered with Caramelized onions and mushrooms, and a side of delicious fries, it's hard to beat!  The Taco salad is HUGE.  Fried tortilla on the bottom, piled with lettuce, tender grilled chicken, corn, black beans, and drizzled with an avocado cream.  The low fat dressing tastes like the real thing. And , of course, the desserts are ALL amazing.  I might add, the service is impeccable, friendly and professional.  My sister asked where I want to go for my birthday, of course I said ""CKF!"""
Nicole C.,"Discovery Bay, CA",502,523,674,2.0,6/12/2011,"We all know that food from the Cheesecake Factory is unwavering and always a good choice when you do not want to face the uncertain. So when I review one of these chain restaurants I judge solely based on service.  When my party arrived (4 of us) we were seated outside almost immediately. Which was great. It was 4:30 pm when we were seated and it was not busy at all! It took a bit for our waitress to come out and take our drink order. When she did, she disappeared for awhile again.  Finally we got our drinks and ordered 3 appetizers to split and our ""intention"" was to share a piece of cheesecake after appetizers as we were headed to a concert that started at 7pm and we did not want to be too full.  We finally got our 3 appetizers about 30+ minutes later...appetizers mind you... Our waitress was too busy having meaningless convesations with anyone who even looked remotely in her direction. She did not bring us our food, nor did she refill our beverages herself. There were about 4 tables, including us in her station.  We ended up finishing, and wanted to share a piece of cheesecake but by the time she finally got around to us it was after 6pm and we had to drop cash and leave. We were 1/2 hour late to our concert b/c she was so slow. Annoying!!! 1.5 hours to get a round of drinks and 3 appetizers. This waitress needs to learn to step it up or step out. So service here, not so good. Food, always good which is why I even gave 2 stars."
J B.,"Roseville, CA",0,5,,5.0,5/28/2015,"The wife and I have never had something we didn't love here. I ordered something off of a different page every time we came here, just to try it all out and haven't gone wrong yet. The staff is really good. The food and environment is awesome.  Thank you."
Donna Alexis B.,"Gridley, CA",2,13,46,3.0,12/15/2013,when you eat here your buying the name and not great tasting food. had the steak diana and shrimp scampi. ordered medium rare came out well done and steak was chopped into 5 bite size pieces scampi had 3 shrimp plate all worth $20. but the cheesecakes they never fail der bomb! service is a wait too argh hate waiting
Daniel G.,"Citrus Heights, CA",178,37,8,4.0,2/19/2014,Their Cheesecake is always excellent! I've had a hit or miss experience with the food though. Their pasta dishes are much better than their burgers. I'll still be coming back for their Red Velvet Cheesecake for sure!
Chelsea H.,"Sacramento, CA",55,114,68,2.0,9/10/2011,"I have two words to sum up my last visit here, ""food poisoning."" I have eaten here several times but a couple of nights ago I ordered the chicken madeira & shrimp scampi, which I have enjoyed on other occasions. I shared some of my chicken & mashed potatoes & ate the shrimp myself. I was woken up in the middle of the night by a horrible case of food poisoning. I will spare you the details, but believe me when I say it was HORRIBLE!!!! Over 48 hours later & I'm still recovering. No one else got sick & I was the only one who ate my shrimp so I'm guessing that was the culprit. I called to let the manager know & he was apologetic. He took my address & I'm guessing he's going to try & lure me back with a gift card or something. Even with a gift card in hand it would be hard to forget this experience & muster up the courage to eat here again. To be fair, I know you can get food poisoning anywhere. Plus I like the cheesecake there & I'm pretty sure you wouldn't get food poisoning from cheesecake, so I'm giving 2 stars for the cheesecake.  Stay away from the shrimp!!!!"
Mike B.,"Roseville, CA",0,68,7,5.0,8/28/2013,"We love this place. They always have great service and the food is always very good. We find the prices more than fair for the huge portions they give you. We usually take out dessert home, and they do a great job packing that up as well. They have a cool little free plate with bread and banana slices for our one year old. She goes crazy when they bring it to the table."
Gem G.,"Roseville, CA",29,28,,4.0,10/27/2013,"What's not to like about the Cheesecake Factory! They have a huge selection. So if you're indecisive, just stay home and eat ramen until you're ready to go back and eat yummy restaurant food. My personal favorites are the miso salmon and buffalo chicken blasts!"
Nadia K.,"Sacramento, CA",0,11,,5.0,12/5/2012,Great experience! We had a girls day out and ate some amazing food and salmon. The service was great. The staff was cheerful. Its not one of my favorites:-) O and the cheese cakes are amazing!
Rich R.,"Citrus Heights, CA",3,29,,4.0,11/5/2013,This place is awesome! Love the Chinese chicken salad and the Thai wraps. They have a lot of options that are not too bad for you. The service is always pretty good. The bread is always good and daily soup options are nice. The best thing is the green tea though!!!!
Kimberly M.,"Chico, CA",13,131,16,4.0,12/30/2013,"Oh how I love the cheesecake factory!! It's standard chain food like the rest of the chains, but I like that there are so many options here. Their menu is practically a book, (even though half of it is ads). The portions are pretty large, and they bring you yummy bread to munch on while you're waiting for your food. The cheesecakes are also super delicious of course!! The service is hit and miss as far as good vs excellent, but I've never had bad service here. This isn't my favorite location because they're always swamped with the mall traffic, but I always stop here while shopping anyways."
B C.,"Sacramento, CA",7,188,54,4.0,10/17/2013,"Keep in mind the Cheesecake Factory is a chain. It's not your hole in the wall mom and pop shop. This is a huge production with cooks in the back (not chefs) putting together stuff that chefs had recipes made up for them to whip together. It's not always exactly as a Chef would put it together, but it's pretty decent.  My favorite dishes are the Shepard's Pie and the Cuban Sandwich.  They are both delicious!"
Giovanny H.,"Clackamas, OR",32,32,3,2.0,12/26/2011,"Anyone who knows me can tell you that I am not a picky eater let alone a harsh critic. I love food, so much that even if it has an expired label on it, I will try it and if good to the tounge...I will still eat it. No lie. Ask any of my college roommates. I was the human food dispenser.  However, my company went in here for a christmas lunchen and I have to say...my meal was....how do you say....""not the business"". I got the Maki Salmon. It was bland, no taste, and a little burnt on the bottom. The rice below the salmon was cold and hard. Never again will I get that dish. The sad thing is that I was actually trying to ""broaden my horizons"" from the usual chicken sandwhich, BIG MISTAKE! I told this to my waitress and she suggested I try the Maki Salmon. Never again. I will no longer ""try something new"" from cheescake. I will only order the traditional burger and fries.   Side Note: I tasted my co workers' meals (since mine was simply gross) and I have to say none of them actually had any distinct flavor. It was as if I was eating the same thing on a different plate. Really odd actually. It was literally cardboard. Alright, I am dont venting. Later."
Michael L.,"Reno, NV",589,731,47,4.0,7/24/2012,"You know I am not usually one to go to TCF as I find it somewhat generic in its preparation of its food. Well I must say this particular store did quite well in bringing flavour to each dish we had along with freshness that one does not always find.  Friendly accurate and attentive service. But just too much food. I really with places like this would offer half priced and sized meals. I know I look like I can eat huge amounts, but I just can't."
Big J.,"Rocklin, CA",0,16,,5.0,6/2/2015,Great food.  Great selection. Great deserts.  What's not to like?  The service can be slow at times so enjoy the food and company.
Ryan H.,"Roseville, CA",8,37,5,3.0,3/7/2014,"The food is decent, however, its always very noisy ... In addition, its rather expensive and the most seats are cumbersome  to sit in."
