Suzanne Z.,"Rocklin, CA",0,61,1,3.0,7/16/2013,"My daughter and I recently had lunch here after a day of shopping. The service was ok. The food was fine. I had a pasta dish with shrimp and chicken. The shrimp was very overcooked, and the chicken was terrific - tender and juicy. My daughter had the orange chicken and enjoyed it. Nothing terribly wrong, but nothing to rave about either."
My-Hanh A.,"Houston, TX",18,18,95,2.0,3/10/2011,"I work right by here so I order togo fairly often... Or often enough. Everyone knows their food is good, but my rating is based on their service.  When calling in for pick up they always ""put you on a short hold"" to transfer you to bakery, which is fine. But when it comes to the service inside when picking up your food it depends on when you come in. If you go in the middle of the day its hit or miss. Sometimes the people in the bakery are aware of someone standing at the counter and other times they have their backs to you, so you have to call out for help. On weekends.......forget about it!! They hardly even pay attention to you. Even the people at the front counter dont even bother to ask if you need help or not. I personally go there for the food.....and not the service."
Tina F.,"San Clemente, CA",209,160,81,4.0,11/6/2011,"Shrimp bistro pasta was so good! Love the desserts , late night closing schedule and the good service.  A few months ago, we also had dinner there and I didn't like what I ordered - curry something. It had dessicated coconut instead of coconut milk mixed in the curry sauce. I abhor dessicated coconut even as a kid.  Now, to mix such an ingredient to a curry dish is just pure laziness! I love the taste of fresh coconut milk in curry sauces but I do understand that to keep costs down they need to have an alternative ingredient. Now, coconut powder mixed in with water also tastes almost as good as the fresh ones. They could have used that instead of dessicated coconut. It was gross! Our server noticed that I barely touched my food and I told her that I didn't like it. She replaced my order with a pasta dish. The manager came over, apologized and we weren't charged for that particular item."
Lindsey C.,"Roseville, CA",89,104,125,4.0,5/29/2013,"Crispy fried cheese, taquitos, french fries, BBQ chopped chicken salad, and lemon raspberry cheesecake. All some of my favorite items at the cheesecake factory and all are pretty much completely unhealthy. Still good nonetheless. Cheesecake factory has pretty much turned into my family's go-to pick for birthday lunches/dinners, casual family dinners, as well as a popular pick when I go on date nights with my sister.  I almost always start with an order of crispy fried cheese, which is mozzarella cheese that comes shaped as triangles with marinara sauce on the side. (I always ask for a side of ranch because who doesn't like fried cheese dipped in ranch?) The BBQ chicken salad at Cheesecake is delicious: romaine lettuce with veggies, chicken, bbq ranch dressing topped with onion straws. When I come to Cheesecake Factory I normally come with the predetermined idea that I going to indulge, so with my salad, I ruin any chance of healthiness by order a side of french fries. The french fries that they serve are some of the greatest fries that I have ever had. How do they get them that perfectly golden and crispy? Now if I am at Cheesecake for a birthday party or some other form of a celebratory event I go for the lemon raspberry cheesecake. There is NO other cheesecake that compares. It is not overly sweet and the tangy raspberry sauce that the slice sits on makes it even more delicious."
Marie N.,"Sacramento, CA",317,272,129,3.0,1/5/2011,"I've been to the Cheesecake Factory on Arden before and my review then probably would have been a 4-star, mostly because I had never been there before and I was easily impressed by my dinner and the awesomely long cheesecake menu.   The food here is good, not spectacular, but good.   I ordered the Hibachi Steak which came with Wasabi mashed potatoes and tempura asparagus.  I do believe that the small and slightly green tinted puddle on top of my potatoes was meant to be the Wasabi... but I tasted nothing of the sort.  Bummer.  My steak chunks were decent, and the asparagus was tasty (although more than two pieces would have been cool, yannow?).  I tried the Tiramisu Cheesecake for the first time, and it was just ok.  Plenty creamy but not much coffee or liquor flavor. Drinks are overpriced and I should have known that any cocktail with the word ""Typhoon"" in it was going to be a cup of sugary water, bleh.  That and it had fruit salad on top.  Totally my fault right there.  Glass of Malbec then, please?  I received a half full glass, inquired about the full glass charge on the tally, and was told that half of their glass IS considered a full.  So therefore half of a half is ... half?  Some manky math you got there, CF. All in all, an OK experience.  Service was pretty good and food/drinks came out in a timely manner, but really nothing terribly WOW'ing here.  You're probably thinking, ""well that's what you get for expecting more from a chain restaurant!"" right?   Really unless there is a group outing or some sort of work function done here, I'd rather go somewhere else in the future. Ps. Do not go here if you are fairly hungry to really hungry.  The 30+  minute wait plus their vast menu will drive you batshit crazy trying to pick something."
Helen F.,"Rocklin, CA",3,51,1,2.0,10/21/2011,"This place went down. We went there sadly because yard house had a two hour wait to be extremely disappointed. They made a mistake on the birthday girls order, not only did we tell them and have them disregard it but they didn't comp or discount anything even with knowing they make the mistake. I was always taught to do what ever it takes to keep the customer happy, 10% off of the ticket would have been slight enough to please everyone instead of an argument and now a bad yelp review for you.  Plus me and the boyfriend shared lettuce wraps and both had a margarita, our bill was 40$. Way to expensive for mediocre food and crappy service. I think I'll stay to cooking and drinking at home!"
Maxim D.,"Roseville, CA",244,134,80,5.0,7/14/2013,Red velvet cheesecake is the best
Karen S.,"Sacramento, CA",264,653,9,4.0,8/26/2009,"I'll be honest; the food is nothing special. I've eaten here at least five times.. The menu is huge. I think the only plus of a place like this is for a VERY large crowd celebrating something and you want to make sure there's something for everyone.  I come here for one thing; I walk up to the to-go counter, order a milk to-go, and two slices of cheesecake... go home, and watch a movie with the boyfriend."
Erica J.,"Roseville, CA",130,15,,4.0,7/24/2013,"Incredible portions, good food, service is usually above average....my only warning is don't go here if you have a hard time making decisions....I usually narrow it down to three things and ask the waiter to pick for me. I like places where my expectations are consistently met - in regards to quality of food, taste, service - no matter the time of day or the location I pick."
Shannon H.,"Orangevale, CA",1,30,,5.0,3/11/2014,Go for happy hour. Best think in town. Can never go wrong with any of the cheesecakes. Wish it wasnt so cowded at dinner times.
Courtney A.,"San Francisco, CA",361,166,8,4.0,2/18/2011,"Ok, look at the nutritional info so you know what you're getting into- some of these entrees have more saturated ft than you should eat in a week (or a year...) that being said, there are a lot of healthy options if you pay attention. But most people come here for a splurge as it should be. I love the strawberry lemonade and its refills (but be aware--you've got like 300 calories per glass). Lately I've been trying out the new small plates. I highly recommend the pear and goat cheese (or maybe it's gorgonzola?) pizzette and the arugula salad. In my personal opinion, the thai and chipotle pastas are just so-so (despite sounding AMAZING in the menu). the lunh specials are a good deal, and they are still HUGE! I got the goat cheese and roasted vegetable pizza with a house salad, and it probably could have fed two people for 10 or 11 bucks. Not so bad. My biggest advice here is know what you're getting into. It's not fun to go out to a restaurant and obsess over grams of fat, but a lot of the dishes on the CF menu that you would THINK are virtuous (the lettuce wraps, for example) really pack a punch.  The service is okay, not bad, not great. But I will always love this place for its variety--everyone can find something they like. The only bad thing is that you risk spending an hour trying to decide! Also--there appears to be a wait here for no reason pretty frequently."
Kaitlyn M.,"Shingle Springs, CA",1,61,,4.0,6/26/2013,"I like to go to The Cheesecake Factory when I'm shopping at the Galleria. I like their teriyaki chicken and their white chicken chili. Of course, I also love their cheesecakes! I always ask for a cheesecake from here for my birthday and my mom gets me a different flavor every year. I haven't had a bad meal or bad dessert here."
Justin D.,"Lincoln, CA",106,117,866,3.0,5/21/2011,"What really sucks is the fact that last time I was here before I had the yelp app it was an easy 5 star rating. This time, the server just failed. Bread was dry, attentive? Only when asking if we wanted more alcohol.... Adhd and waiting tables probably not a great mix. I can say this as a person with Adhd so don't go all politically correct on me. The food it's self is all that earned stars. Better luck next time. :-("
Anna T.,"Sacramento, CA",100,208,15,4.0,3/20/2011,"Food and ambiance-wise, it's pretty much the same as any other Cheesecake Factory that I've been to. But our service here tonight was awesome. Our server, Lacey, was amazing. My friend and I were seated next to a large prom group and she didn't neglect us at all. She checked on us regularly, refilled our bread basket/drinks and she was very knowledgeable about the food. I would totally return to this location just because of her."
Michelle M.,"Roseville, CA",127,229,571,5.0,8/4/2013,"I have to put another review up for Cheesecake Factory!! Last night we went to Yard House to celebrate my birthday...and as stated in my latest review of YH it was a disaster.  So tonight we had a mulligan birthday dinner at Cheesecake Factory! And once again Cheesecake delivered a great evening! Great service, delicious food, and of course my dolce de leche cheesecake with a side vat of hot fudge was spectacular as usual! Thank you Cheesecake Factory for helping me have a much happier birthday celebration!! :-)"
Manjeeta S.,"Rocklin, CA",0,31,9,1.0,2/19/2013,"So the man and i decide to stop over to grab a few slices of cheesecake from their To-Go counter, simple enough right???? WRONG!! Im right there, looking at the girl behind the cash register and she refuses to acknowledge me much less ask me if i needed help. ""excuse me"".......""hi, do you want something??"" ............really? yes um i'd like to get 2 slices to go......*irritated stare from girl* ""sigh"".............i ordered....she rang it up, i apparently had to pay for it right then and she went back to blankly staring in front of her.....is this standard for this restaurant? why have people like this on your staff? Another couple arrived 10 mins after us (still no cheescake btw) ordered and within 2 mins they had their desserts and were gone......ok.....15 minutes later.....""excuse me how long does it take to get 2 slices?"" oh well, we're sorry but we're really busy right now and i'll need for you just wait till i can get someone to fill that order..... ok so now its 25 mins, no cheesecake and we're ready to go, i was furious i couldnt even be bothered to ask for my money back and we're running quite late for another appointment......as we're about to leave, a hostess walks up looking to change a large bill but this girl behind the counter says something and walks away.....my guy offers to change the large bill for her so she can proceed with her  night.......so no home support either.....congratulations! you have an ineffective team member and she's slowing you'r entire to-go section on a saturday night......a valentines weekend at that. 30 minutes by now and my guy just tells the young lady(if we dare call her that) to forget the order we're leaving and she bustles around irritated and gives us 2 containers with messy slices.  i said forget it!, we left the containers, took our money and just left. Im at loss to describe why that happened, what in goodness did we do to piss her off and why were we selectively picked on by this individual i will never know. Im a paying customer, i've always loved coming here, but this time was enough to ward me off. So word of advice.....dont go to the TO-GO counter, if that girl is still around and goodness forbid you just want a measly 2 slices to go, you might piss her off enough to hold you hostage in the name of dessert for half an hour. No Thanks! Good Day to you!"
Anthony G.,"Alexandria, VA",17,85,95,3.0,11/23/2010,"Ehh, they're okay. I mean, they have a diverse menu and are fairly consistent but I'm just not a fan. Maybe because 90% of their menu has enough calories and portion sizes to feed the country of Ethiopia and they still expect you to have a dessert at the end, or maybe because the staff is just never as friendly as they should be.  If they tell you it's a 15 min wait, that means it's a 30 min wait.  I once ordered a salad there and it came out with no dressing. I told the waiter this and he said that the salad was on their ""weight management"" menu and those ones don't come with dressing. I replied, ""well the menu says it comes with dressing"" and he says ""no you're mistaken"". ""Okay"", I reply, ""Please get me a menu"" and proceed to show him where it says dressing. He looks confused, says ""oh sorry"" and brings me a side of dressing. Even if I were wrong, don't argue with me, just bring me the dressing!!! The cheesecakes are of course great and they have a lot of different options but I would rather get one to go and not eat here. Oh, and my Margarita, with house tequila was $11.50!!  Of course they don't publish the prices on their menu so I guess it was my fault for not asking."
K H.,"Roseville, CA",0,3,,2.0,3/29/2014,"Skip the Skinnylicious Menu.  I ordered the Skinnylicious Chicken Sandwich with brioche bread, mayonnaise, roasted almonds, lettuce, and tomato.  Brioche bread at Cheesecake factory is Wonder bread toasted.  There was no lettuce or roasted almonds on the sandwich.  There was a small piece of tomato and a tiny bit of mayo.   The salad that came with the sandwich was lettuce and a small piece of tomato.  The salad dressing was their house vinaigrette.  Vinegar seemed to be the only ingredient.  Their regular menu is great.  Stick with the regular menu and look for lower calorie food at another restaurant."
Jami S.,"Antelope, CA",1,10,,3.0,6/15/2014,"The food was good, and it all looked appetizing. However our waiter was rude and made us feel like a bother due to his condescending attitude, so that's why I give the restaurant a lower score."
Tisa W.,"Northern, CA",27,70,2,4.0,1/3/2011,"One of my Christmas gifts was a gift card for the Cheescake Factory.  We went there for breakfast.  This is definitely one of the better chains.  The food was awesome the wait staff were friendly.  I had the Steak and Eggs.  The steak had this delicious sort of glazing on it that was amazing.  Robert had a huge breakfast burritto.  I checked the nutrician content on it - Holy cow!  1790 calories, 139 carbs -   I will be going back to the CCF.  It is not too expensive and the food is awesome."
