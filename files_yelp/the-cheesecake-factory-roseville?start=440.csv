Ashley I.,"Sacramento, CA",0,27,1,5.0,1/22/2014,"Such a great restaurant! The staff is very kind and the servers are friendly and attentive. I ordered the grande burrito which was not only delicious, but very filling!! Be warned this delicious meal food easily be shared with another person. I will defiantly be back."
Pritika C.,"Sacramento, CA",124,192,95,3.0,9/19/2010,"I've been here several times.  It's very much a hit and miss. Today I ordered their fried mac and cheese appetizer.  Yum yum!  I already love regular mac and cheese and to have it served to you fried is even better!   My sister ordered their chicken samosa and chicken croquette and she enjoyed both of her dishes.   For my drink I thought I would order their strawberry lemonade.  The lemonade offered the perfect amount of tang, sweetness, and color.   The dessert portion of my meal consisted of their Reese's Peanut Butter Cheesecake...heavenly!  For those peanut butter lovers...you cannot go wrong with this dessert...it's all peanut butter, more less.   Peeve...please do something about the white cloth napkins!!!  I was wearing dark jeans and the napkins left white lint all over the jeans...urgh!"
Johnna S.,"Sacramento, CA",606,335,109,2.0,8/16/2010,"So it was 10:30pm and we hadn't eaten yet after a long, hot, typical Sacramento Saturday in July. You know how you just don't get hungry in this weather? Man, I have been suffering. Has this been the hottest summer ever, or what? I'm dyin' to leave town at any opportunity! So anyways, we use the old iPhone Yelp! app to find something open after we're done with our 5 million new-parent obligations.  Bam, Cheesecake Factory, open 'til 12:30 and 1.7 miles from our current location. Made a legal U-Turn and off we went! Let me start by saying we were more than willing to settle for anything at this point. So we weren't coming in being haters, at all. We were totally expecting mediocre, edible food and I was so thankful for their flexible hours that they started at a generous four stars. Yay. It was also baby Z's 6-month birthday. Our server looked like he'd been ""drug through a knothole backwards."" Those are the words my husband used. Isn't he precious? Who the eff says that with no time to think?  The new mother in me was concerned by this young man's condition. Even Zoey was looking at him weird. After we placed our orders, he came by the table to let us know that someone else was going to relieve him. Good, I thought, because this guy looked worked.  The new server told us that the other server had been working since noon. I mean no big deal, when I waitressed I worked a lot of double shifts. Those are also known as money-making shifts, and you usually get out of tedious side work duties when you're on over time. No restaurant  manager in her right mind is gonna make you marry ketchup bottles if you're getting time and a half for it!  Wrong. I watched as the promoted-too-soon manager-on-duty, whom looked less than 21 years old, checked his side work, and made this clearly worn out dude refill 1 salt  shaker. She did this right in front of us, and clearly got off in doing so. Instantly, I decided that I'm never coming back here. A close friend of mine created many of the items featured on the CF's extensive menus. I know what they're supposed to taste like. Which brings me to my next point, which is that the kitchen executed our order horribly. That nit-pickin manager lady needs to concern herself less with salt shakers and socializing and more with with the things people are coming here for: food and drink. But I'm sure it's much harder to throw your weight around back there, where folks are making less than 10$ an hour. The service was not great at any point during our visit. Baby Z was smiling and talking to these people and none of them acknowledged her, other than the exasperated over timer. No stars docked for this but god, how do you ignore a cute little baby that's hooting and cooing with satisfaction just to see your jaded face? Be nice!  My recommendation is this: hire/train a more competent management staff, be nice to the babies, and focus on the food. I feel like having a restaurant within .5 miles of the Galleria is a sure thing just because of its location. These people will buy anything!"
Ashley K.,"Anaheim, CA",46,95,61,3.0,5/12/2009,"Everything at the Cheesecake Factory is over the top!  The staff is great, the decor is awesome, the wait is usually long, the portions are huge, and the caloric intake is extreme.  It's a fun place to eat! The food is good. The cheesecake is awesome! I can't imagine going here all the time though. My pants wouldn't fit anymore. Because really whats the point in coming here if you aren't going to get a piece of cheesecake?"
Vendetta J.,"Folsom, CA",0,32,,2.0,1/23/2011,"Food was decent, service was not.  A friend gave us a gift card for CKF.  We rolled in around 2:30PM for a late lunch.  Was hoping it wouldn't be crowded even though it was Sunday.  Turns out Sunday afternoon is Screaming Child hour.  The restaurant is pretty noisy anyway, the screeching and running around just added to the ambiance.   We waited a few minutes for a table even though the restaurant wasn't terribly busy.  Once we were seated, it took at least 15 minutes before anyone came by to even take our drink order.  Once we'd ordered, it took at least 1/2 hour to get our food.  I got the Factory Burger.  It arrived with no condiments on it.  It was 5 minutes before I could flag down the waitress to ask for ketchup and mustard.   I have to say the wait staff here are masters at avoiding eye contact.   We were right by one of the serving stations and could not attract the attention of anyone other than our server, who came by infrequently. All in all, not a good experience."
Ciera F.,"Wamego, KS",0,9,,3.0,2/18/2015,"Food was very, very bland. More than likely will not be returning. Our waiter was very nice though."
Kerry L.,"Rocklin, CA",3,35,,4.0,7/26/2010,"Ok, I wear my prejudices on my sleeve; I do not like chain restaurants, I do not like restaurants that have more than 12 entrees on the menu, BUT, TCF somehow pulls off a great experience and great food. The service is fast attentive and with the classic ""the customer is always right"" attitude. I had fish tacos that were as good as ones I have had in the gulf coast of Mexico. Perfect, traditional and served with superior rice and Whole black beans. My wife had a Habachi sirloin that she said was as good as $40.00 steaks she has had elsewhere. One other thing I appreciate about this place. If the wait is going to be 10 minutes, they always tell you 15-20 minutes and then pleasantly surprise you. certainly better then the opposite."
Evan L.,"Roseville, CA",0,6,,5.0,2/12/2015,Sat in the cocktail server section tonight  and got prompt service. Impressed. Tall shaved head fellow took good care of us. Was very attentive never intrusive. Keep it up. Limited beer selection but good food and presentation.
James M.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",32,223,89,1.0,11/30/2012,NOTHING is gluten free here. Apparently not even strawberries and whipped cream!  I only come here because my wife likes it but from now on I will bring my own food!  This overpriced chain has made me sick too many times.
Heather S.,"Hayward, CA",93,170,25,4.0,3/25/2013,"The food was good, the service was good, the place was clean.  It's your typical Cheese Cake Factory  :o)"
Kc C.,"Stockton, CA",85,4,1,1.0,1/18/2014,"Awful. We have been waiting for over an hour. Granted I have a big group, 8 people, but there have been 3 groups of 10 on front of us. They are waiting for a large party to leave so we can get their table. That group has been here for over TWO hours!!! If my family didn't want to eat here for my brother in law's birthday I would have walked out long ago."
Norm H.,"Wheatland, CA",140,90,12,5.0,10/6/2008,"Recommended!  My family and I took an early Sunday brunch.  The wait was non-existent for a Sunday morning.  We were seated immediately as we came into the door.  Now, comes the tough part... ordering the food.  Never-mind the slow service...we make up for it by spending hours trying to find something nice on the menu.  Our poor waitress was so patient with us she came by four times... refilling drinks and dropping off a few bread baskets before we made up our minds to order.   Once we made our orders, our food was served shortly with no delays.  The food was great!  We started with the Fried Calamaris...cooked perfectly!  ...very crunchy and tender.  Next, I had the Pasta Carbonara... a very good choice.  My wife and daughter split the Herb Crusted Fillet of Salmon which was also excellent ...and my two little ones split the Fettuccine with Chicken and Sun-dried Tomato's but unfortunately, they weren't happy with that...I think the sun dried tomato's got to them!  No problem...I swapped meals with them ...now everyone was all happy again!  :) Now, comes the best part... the cheese cake finale!!!  After a brief dispute... we all settled for the ""30th ANNIVERSARY CHOCOLATE CAKE CHEESECAKE"".  Yum!  ...what a conclusion to an outstanding brunch."
Agnes A.,"Carmichael, CA",0,5,,1.0,1/12/2015,"Food good.  Drinks good.  Blonde middle-aged waitress in the bar.....horrible!  Why is she yelling?  If she's losing her hearing then I apologize, but that isn't the problem.  She's got an attitude that is very condescending.  She runs around like everyone is in her way including her customers.  Why is she yelling!  She knows what she's doing but man she's got an attitude!  I think she's an angry person.  Not very pleasant.  Why is she yelling?"
S C.,"El Dorado Hills, CA",0,52,2,1.0,4/20/2014,"I am always leery of restaurants with a menu  that rivals an encyclopedia. You would assume that a $23 plate of Seared Ahi would be prepared correctly. You would be wrong as we were. It was cooked all the way through--terrible. My fish tacos were horrible, with no taste. Our teenaged daughters ordered full servings of pasta, and this is the weirdest part. Their pasta arrived plain, with a promise from the waiter that the Alfredo sauce and meat sauce we had ordered with it was in its way (note: we had NOT ordered the sauce on the side). 10 minutes later the sauce hadn't arrived and the pasta was tangled  in a starchy ball. We reordered their pasta which took another 15 minutes. No offer to take anything off our bill, no real apology. The cheesecake, of course, was delicious. Ridiculous for a $220 meal though. We will NOT be back."
Chung W.,"Stockton, CA",9,49,5065,5.0,7/29/2010,"I love this restaurant. Decor is great, I am not a fan of cheesecakes, but I like theirs, I tried 4 or 5 different kind of cheesecakes  since I first time ate there in March this year. My favorite dish is Shepherd Pie, my friend isn't crazy about it because she said there are too many peas in it, perhaps they are the very reason I love the dish, it just makes me feel good eating there"
Mary J.,"Sacramento, CA",0,52,,4.0,11/15/2014,"Way to many choices on the menu, but everything we ordered was good.  Had the chicken madiern(sp)  yum,  chicken with cheese, asparagus and mushrooms with mashed potatoes was great. The cashew chicken was good too."
Yves J S.,"Sacramento, CA",96,280,42,4.0,4/11/2010,"A fun place to go with a group of friends for dinner or just to enjoy some coffee and desert. Cheesecake Factory is a restaurant, bar, bakery in a large elegant building, playfully designed as if it was taken out of a dream filled with candy and sweets.     The food in the restaurant is offered in a variety of flavors from different parts of the world. Each dish boasts a certain quality and taste that is consistent regardless of what you order. The portions are usually served in large portions, leaving in the gluttons such as myself satisfied.     The bakery has an om nom nom factor of om nom nom to the nomth degree! Sweets offered by Cheesecake are the equivalent to those you would think of in a dream. Not only do you have a large array of cheesecakes and cakes to choose from, they also have cakes with cheesecakes! Most of the deserts are their own creations and most worthy of being boasted as Cheesecake originals.      The service tonight killed Roseville Cheesecake from getting 5 stars. I often frequent the Arden location and thus far have been pleased with the service. Our server seemed very lacking in customer care. She appeared to be scheduled to leave soon and decided to be lacking and left us wanting more. Our waters were left to run dry and my cappuccino arrived spilled. I didn't request another since I decided to take the cost of it away from her tip. The food arrived in a reasonable amount of time, and it was delicious!"
Talya V.,"Roseville, CA",0,10,,4.0,12/11/2011,"I love this place. Great food, HUGE selection, knowledgeable staff, great service, and the food is just so yummy. The food portions are so huge that I always have some extra to take home and enjoy for the day after. Most of all the price is good. Mostly, I enjoy the grand selection of cakes and cheesecakes available. It's a great place to eat!"
Stu S.,"Roseville, CA",43,22,6,1.0,5/5/2013,Overpriced crappy food. Had lunch there and paid $53.00 for rubbery fish tacos and fish and chips for my son with a milkshake. Would never return for food like this with an absurd bill to pay for it. Stay away!
Flight A.,"Sacramento, CA",1,16,,4.0,8/23/2011,Best Dirty Martini with Blue Cheese Stuffed Olives I have ever had.   Salmon was pretty good too :)
