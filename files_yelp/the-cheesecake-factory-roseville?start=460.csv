A K.,"Grass Valley, CA",162,77,23,2.0,2/3/2013,"My boyfriend and I went there last night. Our server was a little awkward but that alone wouldn't affect my rating...what really bothered me is that I ordered a bloody mary and I am 99.9% sure that there was no alcohol in it. All I ate was half a piece of cheesecake and I waited after I drank the whole thing and I didn't feel the slightest buzz. It didn't taste like it had any alcohol in it either. They checked my i.d. when I ordered it. Its not like I ordered it virgin. Disappointing.  It was expensive too. Also, service was slow and there was a pretty big piece of paper in my cheesecake. On the bright side,  the cheesecake was tastey."
Angela D.,"Grass Valley, CA",36,180,26,4.0,3/31/2013,We always en joy the Cheesecake factory! Great selection. Very family friendly and the staff are always friendly and well trained. I love the the salads. All of the portions are huge.
Ray B.,"Citrus Heights, CA",29,99,179,4.0,11/23/2010,"Celebrated the holidays a tad bit early and dragged my lunch crew over to the Cheesecake Factory.   I had the fettuccine chicken with sun dried tomatoes which was pretty good.  It was also the perfect size for lunch.  The price was a little high for lunch but bearable.  Their menu is expansive - I foresee many visits in my future. On the downside, the booths are a little too cozy for four grown men..."
Drew T.,"Rocklin, CA",285,879,3018,4.0,6/23/2008,"{{update 5/26}} I reconsidered and gave this location another chance. I came here again for my graduation lunch with about 12 people. Oddly enough, there was no waiting for seating on a Saturday at 12. Not only that, but they blew me away with their service. They had two waitresses for our party just to make sure everything went smoothly and we were never rushed.  They were very informed about the ingredients of their dishes and knew which items were indeed veggie-friendly. $200 for 12 is not bad at all. Though the price might have been held at bay because we kept requesting basket loads of fresh whole wheat bread. The only issue I had was that I asked for fried artichoke and received grilled. It was all good though."
Megan B.,"Cool, CA",8,65,29,4.0,3/14/2013,"Love, love the pumpkin nut cheescake. So delish!!  Wish I hadn't shared with 3 others!!"
Steve R.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,8,,2.0,11/29/2014,"Twenty empty tables and they seated us next to the kitchen. We moved. Ridiculous amounts  of food  that took too long to serve. Very 'by the training manual', everyone role playing and shiny. Unauthentic. Won't go back."
Michael H.,"West Sacramento, CA",440,212,415,4.0,10/13/2010,I ordered the Pasta Da Vinci and Miso Salmon lunch dishes for take out and they were both amazing.  The take out service was great and came out in a timely manner.  It was also convenient since it was located at the mall!
Emi B.,"Citrus Heights, CA",179,18,,5.0,2/15/2013,"LOVE this place. I don't eat here very often, but I work at the galleria & I always refer people down there. I just went the day before valentines day with my mom & they were really busy (6 or so groups sitting waiting & we were told it would be 30-45 mins) but they only took like 20. Our waiter had bread waiting for us & we put in drink orders & they were at the table super fast (I suggest the Georgia peach or piña colada) we ordered & had our food out pretty quick. It was piping hot & delicious as always. I didn't get our waiters name but he was FANTASTIC. Best waiter ever. Talked to us a lot, very attentive & really funny. This was my best experience here yet."
Lauren L.,"Chico, CA",1,12,17,5.0,9/20/2013,"I loved this place. Our server was very friendly and helpful. I got a turkey burger and a salad and both were very tasty. I finished with a raspberry cake/cheesecake which was soooo awesome. They are a little on the pricey end, but really yummy."
Sarah S.,"Emeryville, CA",101,358,47,4.0,3/16/2012,"I haven't been a fan of CF food in the past, except the desserts, but my boyfriend and I are not ones to waste gift cards. So glad to see they have the skinnylicious (?) menu now, and I had the pear and endive salad. That was actually really tasty, and I would order it again. I think the food here is a little overpriced, but I guess the huge crowds they get are fine with that. We had the greatest server, Stephanie, who was the best server I've had in quite awhile. I tried out some of the red velvet cheesecake, which was a little disappointing and kind of bland. I highly recommend Chris' Outrageous Chocolate Cake, though. All the different kinds of cake in there keep it from being overwhelming. So, to sum up: 3 stars for dinner and prices, 4 stars for cake, 5 stars for Stephanie"
K H.,"Rocklin, CA",0,3,,1.0,9/1/2013,"Stay away from Cheesecake Factory if you're considering their Brunch! Everything except the fresh squeezed orange juice was terrible. The worst. Simple eggs Benedict was a 45 minute endeavor and even though ordered poached medium they were almost raw. Grounds in the coffee. The worst part was the unprofessional staff and ended with poorly trained manager (said her name was Theresa) who gave no reassurance that new meals would be properly prepared in a timely manner.  We left after an hour of being seated and no solution in sight. Popped over to Paul Martin's and was treated to the best Brunch we've had a long time. Cheesecake Factory has good food and service during lunch and dinner, but Brunch is a disaster from management down!"
Sarah T.,"Sacramento, CA",98,63,13,3.0,6/16/2014,"We went here yesterday for Father's Day and had an overall pleasant experience. Our waiter was great and our food arrived in a relatively decent amount of time. We always order the avocado rolls as an appetizer. I also like the beet and goat cheese salad. We used to order the vegetarian pizza with goat cheese, but since they've removed that off their menu, I'm yet to find an entree that I LOVE. I ordered the ""Incredible Eggplant Sandwich"" and unfortunately it didn't quite live up to its name for me. After our meal, I received a survey code, after which you get a $10 eCard. I did the survey while my son wandered in the kids' area at the mall, and to my excitement, the code arrived shortly after so we headed back to the restaurant for a slice of cheesecake to go. This is when things went a little sour for me. Now I understand that they are called the CHEESECAKE factory and naturally their dessert section would be pretty busy, however, I stood at the counter and made contact with MULTIPLE employees, none of which even ACKNOWLEDGED me!! After a few minutes of waiting, I finally blurted out ""This is where I stand to make an order, right??"" after which they responded they would be right with me. I ordered ONE slice of cheesecake that was readily available in the counter and then had to wait for over TEN minutes for them to get it ready!!! What the heck! When they finally did prepare it for me, it literally took less than a minute. WHY DID IT TAKE SO LONG FOR THEM TO GET IT FOR ME??? I was tempted to just go back there and get it myself! I'm a relatively patient person, but it just irked me that they would leave me standing there (with no other customers waiting at the physical counter) wait for over ten minutes for something that takes less than a minute.  In summary, meal time was great, but ordering a take out dessert was a much less than desirable experience.  Reservations: They don't take reservations on weekends, and on weekdays you have to have a party of 7 or more."
Bryan L.,"Roseville, CA",5,281,,3.0,10/30/2012,This place  was just ok. When I arrived it was practically empty but they didn't seat me right away. I got stuck at a table way in the back by the door to the kitchen so all I could hear was clanking of dishes and people constantly walking back and forth past me. There were about 8 or 9 waiters/waitresses just standing around or chatting because there weren't a lot of people here. I had a burger and a side salad for something like $14 and the other person I was with had a lunch special of a pizza and salad for $12. Both looked pretty good (much better than my burger) and the portions easily could have fed two people.
Frank V.,"Central Valley, CA",3,78,74,4.0,5/22/2012,Great food and excellent service.  Give the food 4 stars and the service 5 stars.  The location is perfect and close to shopping in Roseville.  Great experience getting food late night with family after shopping at the Galleria.
T. W.,"El Dorado Hills, CA",0,426,202,2.0,1/14/2013,"Tomatoes on the sandwich were near being ripe, but the kids liked their pizza. My wife's order got screwed up.  The waitress made an assumption and left off green chili's off the quesadila and ruined the meal for her.  Too many better restaurants in the area to ever go back to this one."
Geoffrey K.,"Roseville, CA",25,68,8,3.0,1/24/2010,"This review is a bit mixed and it reflects the first time we went to this location of the restaurant. Because of the complexity of the menu, to judge it based on two items is a bit unfair and we will be going again. So take this for what it is worth. We had no waiting time and a Thursday night. The service was excellent, if a bit hyper. ;-) I started with a cup of clam chowder. Considering the size, large, I'd hate to see what a bowl was like. In any case it was very good with a reasonable amount of clam that was very tender. My wife ordered the Spinach, Mushroom, Cheese and Bacon Omelette which comes with potatoes. Sadly both the omelette and potatoes were dry. I could tell the eggs were dry just from appearance. Very disappointing. I ordered the Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp which is served with Black Beans, Plantains and Cool Mango Salsa. I was very pleased with the shrimp. Unlike most restaurants I received a large number of shrimp with were cooked perfectly and with a nice amount of spiciness. The fruit salsa was very good and the plantains were well seasoned and still firm. Black beans are not a personal favorite, but these were well cooked, not mushy but still firm. The rice was on the dry side but the shrimp sauce solved that problem. For desert we split a piece of the Red Velvet Cheese Cake. First we were pleasantly surprised by the large size of the serving. The cake was light and flavorful. We were both very pleased. So over all the experience was mixed, but we certainly will be going back again and hopefully we will both be pleased with our choices. When we go I will follow up on this review."
Marie S.,"Roseville, CA",35,48,1,3.0,8/27/2010,"It's the cheesecake factory, you either love it or hate it. Very expensive but the portions are generous.  If you add on alcoholic drinks plan on doubling your bill. Almost always a wait at the galleria location, not enough seating in the waiting area so you find people spilling into the parking lot or standing at the bar. My husband and I usually order a drink and a few appetizers to share.  We leave full and happy.  Comes to around $60 for two people. Cheesecake is always a must, and I agree with the other reviews, the red velvet 1600 + calorie cheesecake is THE BEST!"
Vicki O.,"Orangevale, CA",1,30,19,5.0,1/19/2010,"You can't go wrong with the Cheesecake Factory. The food is consistantly good, the staff is helpful with the menu and I love the location at the Galleria and go often. I had the best Cuban sandwich I ever had since leaving Miami. The Mahi dinner was very good as well. My favorite cheesecake - Chocolate tuxedo! Can you handle the truth?"
Jessica L.,"Sacramento, CA",242,328,28,4.0,11/21/2011,"cheesecake factory: satisfactory but not super. (no surprise there). I am really glad they have a new ""healthier options"" menu. I guess getting voted the most unhealthy chain restaurant in the country will make you re-evaluate your menu choices....I got a half sandwich and salad, it was the perfect portion for a late lunch after some shopping, and the prices were much more reasonable.  Our server was also really sweet, I wish I could remember her name..she was very attentive, friendly and efficient."
Just N.,"Winston-Salem, NC",19,149,1013,4.0,7/2/2010,"We came here last night at 9 PM, after a day of wasting our time at the mall. Since it was late, the place wasn't crowded. $2.95 coffee $1.50 kid soda $8.95 chicken pot stickers $9.95 Vietnamese rolls $5.95 chicken kid's meal $6.95 cheesecake I was starving, but didn't want anything heavy. It was 9 PM after all, so I ordered the summer rolls. My older son didn't see anything on the kids menu, so I OK'd the order of pot stickers. The bread they brought out was soooo good...either that or we were just really hungry. We ate both portions and asked for seconds. My older son didn't like the summer rolls, so I ended up eating all 3 servings. It came with two dipping sauces. The one was good, the peanut one, I didn't like. The pot stickers were excellent! Very crispy outside, but what made me and my son a fan was the soy sauce sauce it sat at. We both could have drank it. I dipped my summer rolls in it rather than the two sauces my rolls came with. It was soooo good. My toddler ate his chicken strips, and as usual, no complaints from him. His meal came with two dipping sauces as well - honey mustard and ranch. We ended the meal with a slice of vanilla bean cheesecake. My older son said the graham cracker crust was the best he ever had - and that's what he ate. The little one ate the two big dollops of whipped cream, and I ate the actual cheesecake. Very yummy. Would come back and try other things. The service was good. We ate for around $40 - would have been cheaper if the other kid ate from the kid's menu - but oh well."
