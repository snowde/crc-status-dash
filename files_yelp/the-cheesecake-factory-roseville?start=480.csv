SacTown G.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,245,1,4.0,5/12/2013,"This is a very solid restaurant.  Amazingly busy.  Makes me want to buy Cheesecake Factory stock every time I am there. Had lunch there today, on Mother's Day, and it was exceptionally busy. The wait was 30 minutes+ for a table, 45 minutes for food, and then they messed my order up. However, the manager quickly came out to apologize and told me he'd take care of my entree. I didn't ask and to me it's BIG that they stepped up. Props to the manager.  Waitress was good as well. The food is consistent and large. It's  a solid 4 star to me."
Rich J.,"Folsom, CA",0,12,,5.0,4/30/2013,"Love this place, we always sit in the bar area so we can get the the same waitress, great food, more than enough portions, and the service is always good. And of course the CheeseCake is amazing, and if you're not into cheesecake try the Linda's Fudge Cake....Amazing!!"
Tanya M.,"Antelope, CA",88,39,27,5.0,5/7/2015,"me and my best friend always come here. we love it. but this time we came it was busy per say. me and her waited about 10 min to get bread once we were seated which was longer than before but its ok. the problem happened once we ordered our food. we waited about 35-40 min to actually get our food. people who came after us already got theirs. so once we got our food i jokingly said oh wow finally we got our food after 35-40 min. the waitress Heather apologized and asked if anything else was needed which we were all good. about 5 min later a manager  Steven T. comes up to us and apologized for the food being super super late and asked if  we needed anything or whatnot. i jokingly said a free cheesecake lol. to which he replied, oh yes i can do that... long story short the experience was awesome, it started out bad but ended great and we still tipped the waitress pretty good. i just wanted to write this to acknowledge how great the customer service was and even the fact that the waitress went to the manager. we didn't ask her to or complained, but still her doing that was beautiful. thanks guys. please please acknowledge those 2 awesome people."
Laura W.,"Sacramento, CA",48,158,8,3.0,8/14/2009,"My review is based on the two times I've been to the Roseville location. The three times at Arden were horrible, but my Roseville experience has been mixed. First experience: Went for a late lunch/early dinner. It wasn't crowded, the three of us were seated at a quiet booth and our server was excellent. I had the burrito, which is ginormous and filled with yummy chicken, cheese, rice, beans, veggies and fruit. It comes with a SMALL amount of guacamole and sour cream, but not hot sauce.  I named my first teddy bear ""Hot Sauce"" when I was 3 years old, so I need me some spice to Mexican food. They brought me their red hot sauce, warning it was *very* hot. It's medium hot, at best, but added the spice I needed. The burrito is like three meals, so it's a great deal. The ladies I were with loved their food and we shared a delicious slice of vanilla cheesecake.  I was so impressed with the service, burrito and cheesecake, I chose to go there for my birthday dinner....and I never CHOOSE to go to Roseville.  Second experience: Went for a late dinner with a party of seven. They were not crowded at all, but our food took a long time to come and almost everyone, if not everyone, was underwhelmed with service and food.  Maybe I should have known better than to order Thai food at an American chain restaurant. But the description of ""A Spicy Thai Dish with the Flavors of Curry, Peanut, Chile and Coconut. Sautéed with Vegetables and Served over Steamed White Rice"" sounded really good. For something called ""Bang - Bang Chicken and Shrimp,"" I expected it to have some BANG! to it. Especially after the waiter's warning it that it packed quite a punch. More like a pat on the back. It was bland to the blanditty bland. I asked the waiter if it could be spiced up, he suggested more sauce, which didn't seem like it would help considering how bland the sauce was, but I said ok. It didn't help. I love Thai food and this was terrible. I also love carrot cake and cheesecake, but their carrot cheesecake is just ok.  I still crave their vanilla cheesecake and those burritos, but the last visit left me pretty dissatisfied."
Jim W.,"Citrus Heights, CA",0,16,,3.0,8/20/2014,"Good service, good food.  Almost too many choices.  Great venue to have a large family dinner or after work gathering.  Happy hour at the bar was nice too."
Marina P.,"Natomas, Sacramento, CA",0,7,4,5.0,12/11/2011,"Wow, skinnylicious indeed!!  My hubby and I are regular patrons of Cheesecake Factory in multiple cities.  The dishes we keep ordering again and again include the Vietnamese shrimp summer rolls, cajun jambalaya pasta, miso salmon, chicken salad sandwich and most of their soups.  We have never considered the soft tacos because we thought they wouldn't compare to the ones at authentic Mexican restaurants.  Okay, my hubby had tried their enchiladas before (but that's because he loves enchiladas and would try enchiladas at pretty much anywhere).  Today we were given the skinnylicious menu in addition to the regular menu and I was going to order the skinnylicious chicken salad sandwich when suddenly hubby wanted to try the soft tacos.  I looked at him in shock ""don't you normally like crispy tacos? I am the one who likes soft tacos!!"".  Our server then proceeded to tell us the skinnylicious soft tacos is one of her top three favorite dishes at Cheesecake Factory and that she absolutely loves it.  We both decided to get it and we were worried how we would like a dish we both hadn't tried before.  The tacos (three soft corn tortillas filled with spicy chicken or shrimp, avocado, tomato, onions, cilantro and crema, served with spanish rice) came and they looked good.  Little did we know how much we were going to LOVE them!  We both inhaled them as fast as we could because they were just divine!!  They were not greasy or heavy and the sauce on the side gave the tacos a nice ""kick"".  Even after three tacos for each of us, we didn't feel the heavy, heartburn-about-to-happen feeling.  We felt like we could inhale a fourth one and were glad they ""only"" came with three.  I was always suspicious of the ""under-so-many-calories light menu"" because I would rather take the calories and be fat than have bland hard-to-get-down food.  I seriously don't know how these three tacos and the side rice dish can amount to under 590 calories.  I am so over the moon with this soft tacos dish that I want to have it again tomorrow for lunch (that would involve going to the restaurant again because, of course, we didn't have any leftovers!).  Thank you, Cheesecake Factory, for the heavenly skinnylicious soft tacos.  I also saw so many other items I want to try from the skinnylicious menu.  Wow, unbelievable, I am speechless ;-) Super yummy delicious food on the skinny menu!! Bottom line: You should all try it! (See our photo of it...)"
Brittany H.,"Roseville, CA",171,270,20,4.0,2/24/2010,"I've been to this location a few times since it's opened. Most recently, I went over Valentine's day weekend, and even though it was ridiculously packed, it still did not disappoint! My favorite dish is the chicken farfalle pasta. I really can't even begin to explain how much I love it, I could probably eat it daily and still love it! The portions are large, but that could be due to the fact that they serve you endless bread that's so yummy to where I'm not even hungry when my food comes! This Cheesecake Factory is smaller than others, but the service is much better! Every server and hostess I've talked to there are very nice. Last time I was there my friend's dish had a hair in it, and the manager himself came out to explain how sorry he was and he seemed very genuine about it.  I only have 2 issues with the place: 1. It's always very busy, which is fine. But expect to wait a little longer than they tell you. If the hostess says 30 minutes, expect 45 minutes, at minimum. 2. Last time I went they have the calorie counts directly posted, practically ON the cheesecake! I understand that this is the law now, but seriously, to see that one piece of cheesecake that I would love to demolish has enough calories to feed one for an entire day is a slight turn-off, and surprisingly, it made me not want to take any cheesecake to go! (Maybe it's just me that has a complaint about this.) Overall, this place is definitely yummy! I recommend going if you want good food, great service, and a fun atmosphere."
Dennis D.,"Roseville, CA",8,23,2,4.0,4/6/2011,"Been here a few times and the food never disappoints - the four stars is because of the service. The first occasion we had a fairly large party and everything was going great, that is until we asked to split the bill - long story short the employees here are no math majors. The food and drinks were definitely worth the money, and I am confident everyone left feeling satisfied. Second occasion service was better since it was just a friend and I, however the waitress seemed a bit annoying. I ordered the Salmon and had a glass of Pino - delicious!"
Tanisha B.,"Sacramento, CA",269,173,66,4.0,1/30/2010,"**Dessert Review only** After doing my fill of shopping at the Galleria, I was craving something sweet so I had to stop in here. I was pretty undecided on what to get, but after a little help from the hostess at the counter I got a slice of Key Lime Cheesecake and a slice of the (I think) German Chocolate Cheesecake. I'm trying to pace myself, so I've only eaten the key lime. It's pretty good. They slice of lime that was on top i was thinking would be a slice of actual key lime, not bitter lime. Oh well, I'll still be back when i have a sweet tooth."
Fo S.,"Roseville, CA",3,84,,4.0,4/22/2012,"Been here many times.  Chicken picata is great and huge portions!  Great menu, atmosphere and kid-friendly."
Stacy B.,"Elk Grove, CA",126,310,214,4.0,10/21/2009,Two words: WHITE PIZZA. Holy crap.
Tom H.,"Roseville, CA",0,1,,1.0,4/24/2014,"Had high hopes after eating here in the past, however the food quality as many have said has gone down hill. My kids ordered the chicken strips and the mini sliders. The chicken was absent from the strips leaving over fried , greasey, and unseasoned breading. The hamburger tasted like a frozen , recently warmed piece of lard and hat my son refused to eat: and who's decision I supported fully. Wait staff though nice was unhelpful or caring with the quality of food. We will not be coming back again."
Shawnee R.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,22,,5.0,5/19/2012,"Outstanding staff, yummy food, lots of choices, always a nice crowd, they have tv's at the bar. Comfortable seating, great location but my favorite is the customer service."
Meghan W.,"Penryn, CA",726,144,52,2.0,3/22/2011,"I'm going to make this short and sweet... while the food was ok I was so turned off by the drinks we received. I don't think it would have been possible to fit more ice in my glass and I could have drank 10 of them before feeling a buzz. Look, I know times might be tough... but I have never had such a crappy drink (well.. I had 2 thinking it would have been better by the 2nd round. I WAS WRONG)."
Robert R.,"Orangevale, CA",5,12,1,4.0,3/24/2012,Well....have heard about it from everyone....and finally tried it.  We were happy with the experience and the food.  It was my girls birthday and she really enjoyed the food.  The food was cooked well and was hot.  It was on the expensive side for what it was but good.  They made her feel special and that is what is important.  We took some cheesecake to go.  They packed everything for us which was nice.  We will go again
Clayton B.,"Sacramento, CA",60,166,20,4.0,3/22/2011,"i have been going here for quite a while with friends and really like it. i am not so keen on the ginormous portions the white uniforms or the heavy soda glasses but those minor compared to what i think are big pluses. the service is generally consistent. the best i have has is from a girl named Natalie S or apparently ""football"" because she is a crazy foot ball person. super nice and can keep up with me as i like someone with a personality and can be sarcastic right back to me. lol um but ya the food is on par with any other cheesecake. the drinks are good."
Mary G.,"Roseville, CA",28,26,,5.0,2/27/2012,"As far as my husband's and my ""happy hour hunt"" game goes, this place is the winner (so far).  My lemon drop was yummies, the food was delicious, and the service was great.  I will definitely return for happy hour."
Yelp D.,"Sacramento, CA",0,1,,5.0,2/23/2013,"Seriously the best staff here! - I went there last night with group of over 20 people for a birthday dinner. There was a miscommunication with one of our orders, Chris the manager came over to our table and took care of everything right away. Our server Randon was very patient and pleasant the whole time although I'm pretty sure we were driving him nuts . Food is always great at the cheesecake but their service made it even better. Great job Chris and Randon, and the cute waitress with a white flower in her hair :)"
Gina B.,"Rio Linda, CA",0,124,45,3.0,11/27/2011,"This place is not the first restaurant I would choose, but they aren't incredibly bad either. 3 stars because I'm pretty much in the middle of the road with this place. Sometimes I have good experiences, and other times bad. They put a whole heck of a lot of cilantro on a lot of the dishes, to the point where that's all you can taste. I usually love avocado egg rolls, but these taste like they just got out of the microwave. I do like the chicken and biscuits here and the California cheesesteak.  They have one drink here that is just fricken amazing. The Georgia peach is one of the best drinks of anywhere. Tastes like biting into a juicy ripe peach. I'm also not the biggest fan of cheesecake, but I do like their original cheesecake. However, it's extremely overpriced. Like $20 for a small cheesecake. Not worth it."
Kristy C.,"Studio City, CA",220,354,,3.0,11/28/2008,"Nice friggin bar menu! I'm only alotting three stars because I'm a snob and don't want to be reviewing a huge chain corporation, but when I find me some good drinks and a radical happy hour price--I'll bend. Literally. Avocado rolls--excellent. warm, full, four of them and 2.95 chicken potstickers--nice flavor, too much soy sauce. 2.95 sliders--3.95 BLT salad, chopped salad, ceasar salad--all 2.95 cuban sandwiches--3.95 pulled pork sandwiches--4.95 and a hearty ""holy crap!"" to my friends sangria and pomegranite mojito..the sangria actually tasted like red wine and the mojito was huge and tasty. The waitress came by constantly and gave us bread, she even added extra whipped cream to our peppermint bark cheesecake!!!!"
