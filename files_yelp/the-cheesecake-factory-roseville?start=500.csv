K.G. S.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",44,92,24,2.0,2/4/2011,"One day, I walked up to the Cheesecake Factory fifteen minutes before they closed, and an employee ran up to the door, locked it and yelled that they were closing. I'm pretty sure I just wanted to check the time they closed. Sheesh..."
Mercedes G.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",156,59,,4.0,4/18/2009,"Yep, I just reviewed the Arden location, but this was actually the first one I'd been to. Again, fish tacos = amazing. I just needed to review this one because our service was seriously FANTASTIC. I wish I could remember the chick's name...she was blonde, super peppy and cute...and she doesn't work Sundays (ha). I want to say it was Jessica...and I'm mad because I just threw out my receipt. Anyway, if you sit in her section, she's pretty much the best."
Heather O.,"Roseville, CA",150,209,150,4.0,9/20/2011,"Great respectable servers, usually great table service (cheese cakes folks are awesome and bubbly) ... thanks for making every visit memorable and food is usually pretty darn good. Most dishes are incredible and portions are generous to off-set the generous bill that will most likely follow."
Jonathan B.,"Olivehurst, CA",45,28,,4.0,3/28/2012,This place is great...good service...tons of food to choose from and its always been very good! Price is average for a nice sit down dinner!
Jillanne D.,"Wichita Falls, TX",14,162,4,4.0,8/12/2009,"Cheesecake Factory is always a safe establishment to eat at if you want something familiar! The food here is great and the portions are huge! I love ordering some type of pasta or the chicken bellagio.  The cheesecakes are delicious. Honestly, that's the only reason why me and my husband make the trip to Roseville.  And yes, the wait can be LONG!"
Kristen L.,"Manhattan, KS",111,200,23,4.0,1/7/2009,"Don't get the chicken and biscuits. Everything on the plate tastes of the gravy - and it's kind of gross. BUT other than that AMAZING place. I really like the set up of this location - it seems more open (although the mirrors on the booths are totally distracting). Our waitress was adorable and didn't let us get thirsty, which is really big with me. Our drinks never got lower than half empty. Great place, and GREAT cheesecake!  (Parking sucks on a busy day though. They really should have their own lot. My boyfriend and I couldn't find parking and left our first attempt)"
Mic N.,"Sacramento, CA",0,9,,3.0,6/9/2012,"Seriously folks...this is a cheesecake factory. You might as well be rating a mcdonalds or a dominos.  Every cheesecake factory is exactly the same.  The menu items are the same.  The food is prepared the same way.  The waitstaff wears the same outfits.  The decor is the same.  The lighting program is the same. And guess what...even the cheesecake is the same and comes from the same cheesecake factory that distributes cheesecakes to the cheesecake factory restaurant franchise locations located in every suburban city around the country.   So, stop reading here and go read or write reviews about interesting restaurants.   However, confirm that reviews for interesting restaurants were not written by anyone posting a a serious review about this place or any other overly common franchise (chilis, applebees, macaroni grill, etc). Here's what you need to know about the cheesecake factory. If you are hungry for anything you could possibly dream up and want a whole lot of it, go here."
Joe P.,"Sacramento, CA",10,151,,2.0,4/11/2011,"Ok so we go there Sat @ lunch time and we expect a wait,not a problem they tell us about 30 minutes.We proceed to the bar for some drinks.Had a great time in the bar area and that's when it ended.We were seated and our server was friendly and all just way to SLOW.After we placed our food orders it was at least 30 minutes and might have been closer to 45 minutes till we go our food.When we did get it the Mgr brought and made a smart ass comment""we just wanted to make sure you were all really hunger before we served you"".Very unprofessional and I made a comment back stating very disappointed with the service and was not even acknowledged .What a jerk ! Anyway food was so so and service was terrible.Another chain restaurant bites the dust for me !"
Sandra W.,"Roseville, CA",6,229,,4.0,7/16/2009,"We usually eat off hours, so we've always been seated right away....we've never experienced the long wait of some of the other reviewers...   We found the service excellent and the food very good.  The portions are really large, so it's possible to split a order with a friend.   We just love the hot bread in the bread baskets!  Yum.     Oh...and the cheesecake is really good too!"
Cheryl T.,"Mesa, AZ",159,17,,4.0,7/25/2010,"Favorite part about this place- the GREAT happy hour.  Don't get me wrong, the food is great too: my favorites are the chicken costoletta (sp?), crusted chicken romano and he orange chicken.  But anyway, back to happy hour: so far this is the cheapest happy hour I've found in Roseville.  The selection isn't very big but the cocktails are only $5 and you get a lot of bang for your buck.  The drinks are large and strong.  I'd recommend JW's Pink Lemonade.  I personally couldn't taste the alcohol, but I sure felt it.  It was delicious and I'll definitely be back."
Cheryl K.,"Granite Bay, CA",45,19,2,4.0,10/26/2011,"I went there for lunch today. Great atmosphere, easy to get to and my food was delicious, especially the cheesecake."
Jessica H.,"Orangevale, CA",299,399,213,4.0,10/21/2010,"This is a good eating option when at the Galleria. It's SUPER difficult to find when in the mall, much easier to find if you just drive and part near it. The bar service is pretty decent and I especially like the patio at this location. Dinner time you're usually going to have to wait to be seated and definitely wait on weekends unless the has bar open seating."
Liz S.,"Sacramento, CA",115,68,15,2.0,7/10/2010,"If you like broken glass, slow service, a bleeding hand, and no discount on the bill--eat at the Cheesecake Factory in Roseville."
H D.,"Sacramento, CA",27,463,84,4.0,2/22/2013,"Very consistent this place is. Cheesecake Factory may be not coming in as predicted stock wise, as reported recently in the news, but in terms of delivering in Roseville, it is. This place is always hopping. Between the shoppers, the bar crowd, the patio patrons, the families and the celebrators a lot is happening.  It is the place where the food is what you expect visit to visit.  The servers dressed in all white make you feel like they are there and ready to help but not there too much.  This location is not an only upscale location but caters to a wide variety of people. Bring your kids but you might find yourself led to a section of people also with kids, so don't be surprised. The service here, while not top notch, is pretty good most of the time.  The wide variety of food choices ensures table happiness. Portions are plentiful so budget your stomach room and definitely try a new piece of cheesecake, (afterall why are you here at the Cheesecake Factory?), and share it with a friend because it is so rich.   We continue to come back because this place continues to be a restaurant where we leave happy and satisfied and it adds to our evening not detracts."
Jenae A.,"Roseville, CA",154,262,143,4.0,1/13/2011,"Pros: Huge menu, yummy food, nice sized drink menu.  Cons: The staff can be a little douchebaggish at times and the wait is usually horrendous.  Its a fun place to eat if you're with a larger group of people."
Nicole T.,"Studio City, CA",0,14,,3.0,7/31/2011,"I love the Cheesecake Factory everywhere I go, but the only thing I do not like about this location is how long the wait normally is and their outdoor seating is very small.  I love the Cheesecake Factories in Southern California because they all have very big decks and the ambiance is better."
Danielle J.,"Napa, CA",71,12,,3.0,10/4/2010,"Delicious food and the most AMAZING cheesecake I have ever had the pleasure of stuffing my face with. Only, I will never go back because of the amount of calories that are in each meal and piece of cheesecake. over 1,000 for both. YIKES!"
Carizma D.,"Sacramento, CA",13,90,3,3.0,12/2/2010,"So,  I have been to Cheesecake Factory before and just decided that I don't like it. I attended a birthday dinner this past weekend. Just to make a long story short: The birthday girl had ""made reservation"", to find out 2 hours before that they do not do reservation on the weekends. So someone messed up but fine, that issue was not a biggie. I ordered a drink at the bar so I wouldn't have gratuity added. Thought I was smart; WRONG- I did not know I had ordered a $12 cocktail. I am not cheap but I have never paid that much for a drink. Then someone ordered a crab and artichoke app. GROSS- really tangy and cold, however it was delivered in a hot plate/tray thingy- I ordered a Blue Cheese BLT burger- I actually have to say that it was pretty good. This experience did not restore my faith but I won't cringe every time i hear cheesecake factory :-)"
Clifton L.,"Socorro, NM",0,6,,5.0,9/4/2011,"If your looking up a place to eat and come across a Cheesecake Factory wondering, ""what is this like?"". Nothing compares, every aspect of dining at the CF is met with the highest quality. I enjoy the mint green tea (sweetened). It's refreshing, cool and a great with the meal. The bread that is brought out prepares you for the beginning of a great meal. Each of the chicken plates I've had so far are delicious. I have to point out that the plate portions are large! Two people can easily share a plate.  If you want to establish a standard for making homemade cheesecake, find your taste here at CF and take it from there. I've had the Red Velvet, Key-Lime, and the list goes on and on. The cheesecake is phenomenal and when my wife makes homemade cheesecake we wonder who CF can do what they do. I have to point out that for the two locations I visited in the Sacramento area the service is top-notch. I appreciate servers who understand what they need to do in the service industry. I have been impressed with each of the waitresses who did not allow doubt to come across my mind."
Nonnie H.,"Valley Springs, CA",16,54,,5.0,3/16/2010,"Food is great one my Fav Chains,  Th only draw back for me is they serve a fruity type Tea, and i like just plain Tea , but other wise we have always had a great meal with leftovers for lunch!"
