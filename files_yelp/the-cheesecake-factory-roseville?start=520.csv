Amber L.,"Lincoln, CA",13,72,12,3.0,12/10/2012,"holiday dinner party! so sad that they don't take reservations for large parties for local businesses on the weekend!! But I was able to call ahead of time and tell them my name, the time we were coming and how many were in our party. We were planning on arriving at 6:15. I got there at 5:20 to make sure we had our table at that time. Everyone else arrived on time, when I told them we would be there... And we ended up waiting to be seated until 7. By then we were super hungry so it is nice that they serve bread. We had bread for about an hour until our food finally came (I think they refilled it about 3 times) and by then we were full off of bread. A couple of people ordered burgers and wanted them well done with no pink at all. They came out rare, and were sent back and prepared again and brought out when everyone else was done eating. I've had better experiences here.. I know they can do better. Guess they just can't handle larger parties.. So wouldn't recommend for special occasions. Especially when your tab ends up being $300+.. Go spend it somewhere that can handle it and treat you well..."
Jonnie S.,"Fair Oaks, CA",48,25,10,4.0,7/14/2011,"Place is always amazing. Try one of the glamor bugers, they are mouth watering."
Mrs. B.,"San Luis Obispo, CA",0,419,37,3.0,11/22/2010,"This is what happens when a restaurant tries to do too much. No need to have asian food and mac & cheese in the same restaurant. The cheesecake is tasty but with 80g of fat in each piece (yes, that's more fat grams than most hamburgers) I recommend sharing a piece with a friend (or three). You could easily consume in excess of 4,000 kcal here in one meal & for that reason I choose not to eat here."
J M.,"Rocklin, CA",0,4,,4.0,6/28/2011,Great for a chain.  You always know what you are going to get. I especially love the caesar salads.   Portions are generous and service is always good.
Jen H.,"Roseville, CA",234,222,51,3.0,7/31/2010,"I am not sure how I feel about this place.  The cheesecake is great - that should be a no-brainer.  However, on my last trip I ordered the Avocado egg rolls and was really disappointed.  They were too tangy.  CPK has them beat for that recipe.  Our waiter was great at the beginning, but as the meal progressed he was harder to track down.  I just wanted boxes and my bill, but he had other things to do I guess."
Randall S.,"Corpus Christi, TX",127,137,,5.0,8/10/2010,"When I go here I always get the avocado egg rolls, and the teriyaki chicken which is awesome. The thing about this place though is it does have such a wide variety of food, and when your in the mood for something in particular, they usually have it (unless it is pretty unusual). I also recommend the caramel chicken which is almost like general's chicken from a regular chinese restaurant."
Lisa D.,"Reno, NV",122,3,,5.0,3/5/2011,"I absolutely love The Cheesecake Factory!  My favorite cheesecake is the Lemon Raspberry Cream Cheesecake!!  I really hope this restaurant comes to Reno, NV, but it's a great excuse to drive to Roseville and enjoy a day of shopping and a treat from the Cheesecake Factory!!"
Audrey G.,"San Francisco, CA",5,4,,5.0,2/14/2013,"My boyfriend and I went to this chain tonight and were pleasantly surprised with the customer service. We both ordered burgers and I ordered mine medium well as usual. Unfortunately, my burger was a little too pink for my liking. I let our waitress, Anna, know and she immediately took it to the back to get it replaced. Her manager, Chris, then came over and made it clear to apologize for the uncooked meat and to let me know that if there were any more problems, he would love to pay for our dessert. A few moments later, another manager, Slade, came over and also apologized saying that he wanted to make sure we were not upset. I got the burger back within minutes and it was PERFECT. Slade and Anna both came back to check on me and make sure I was satisfied. When we were ready to order our desserts, Anna let us know that they were completely covered and we couldn't have been more surprised! That is not what we were expecting at all and it made us very pleased and eager to return. I totally recommend this restaurant. Not only is the food and cheesecake phenomenal, the customer service is amazing. They definitely have a great team."
Ivy S.,"Roseville, CA",253,24,3,4.0,8/2/2012,"YUMMM...is all I can say!  Every time  visit, I am pleased to leave with a full tummy and a smile on my face!  Some of our favorites are the avocado eggrolls and the fried mac & cheese... Delicious!  The ambiance is nice...we have had intimate dates as well as family gatherings, and they nicely accommodate both.  Good stuff :)"
Marissa C.,"Sacramento, CA",15,55,3,4.0,5/18/2008,"After a long day of shopping, we decided to try the Galleria's Cheesecake Factory for a late lunch.  We walked in around 1pm and it was packed!  I asked how long of a wait for a table of 4 and the hostess said around 15-30minutes.  After a 15 minute wait, our buzzer went off.   We were seated in the bar area which I was interesting since we had our 3 year old son with us.  It was fine since we were at the edge of the bar and he was more interested yelling out the colors of each drink he saw.  Our waitress was wonderful!  She never let our drinks go empty and always kept the table uncluttered.  We had our Calamari appetizer, it was tender and lightly breaded.  The garlic dip was bland and tasted more like mayo. We waited a LONG time for our food.  As we looked around, everyone had the same face ""Where is our food?""  At 2:15, our food finally came out, the Herb Crusted Salmon, Crusted Chicken Romano, Lettuce Wraps and Grilled Cheese all looked and tasted wonderful.  Our son did not touch his grilled cheese because he wanted to go outside.  The long wait for food did not do well for him.... The manager came around right after we got our food; which was interesting because where was she when we were waiting.  Besides the wait, our lunch was great and will go there again.   PROS:  Great wait staff, attentive assistant waiters, and great food. CONS:  No kid's menu, and the long wait for food."
Jacob J.,"Roseville, CA",0,20,,3.0,11/11/2012,"Service is good, food is good but if you want to eat with the trash from Sacramento, Antelope & North Highlands you should go here.  Busy place but good.  Sacramento is not known as the worst place in the United States for tipping for no good reason, is it?"
Debi S.,"Vermilion, OH",29,44,1,5.0,5/29/2010,"We went when they first opened & it was good but not great. Last night we went there again. What a difference! The food was amazing! A new updated menu. The food tasted so fresh & delicious! Our server was very attentive. The baby had the chicken finger child menu. It was very tasty. They brought her a small plate with litle bread slices & bananas on it for a starter. My husband had the spicy cashew chicken & I had the crispy chicken costelleta (sp?) They were both delicious. We are alrady looking firward to going back & trying new menu items. It's been a long time since we have gone out to dinner & had food & service this awesome. And the wait for a table was only 15 minutes @ 630 on a friday night. Cheesecake Factory, you are awesome!"
Charles R.,"Citrus Heights, CA",0,10,,5.0,1/21/2013,Stopped in to have refreshments at the bar. The two young lady servers were excellent. Food and drinks were excellent as well.
J Jay D.,"East Bay, CA",0,60,,4.0,9/10/2012,"Big portions. Pretty good food. A crazy long wait and it's super crowded. And they don't take reservations! So you either eat at 5 or wait til 10. But, the seared tuna is good. And the cheesecake is divine. If you have a lot of time to kill, go here. If not, go somewhere else."
Jo K.,"Fair Oaks, CA",3,58,,5.0,8/25/2010,"Had lunch at the Cheesecake Factory today with my mom and daughter.  As always,  food was excellent but the service was fantastic.  Our waiter, Mike P.  had personality plus.  He is definitely as asset to their team.  We will be back again and again......"
Tom T.,"Lincoln, CA",9,27,5,5.0,6/8/2012,"Excellent food, great service, a little pricey but if I knew the kid servings were going to be big enough for 2 to 4 kids I could have saved 30 or 40 dollars."
Mark M.,"Rocklin, CA",0,20,,5.0,7/31/2010,"An 11 on a 10 scale...food is to die for, the cheesecake is awesome. Best high scale place in Roseville!"
Chandler H.,"El Dorado Hills, CA",2,32,,4.0,2/25/2009,"I wanted to try it when it first opened but I decided to wait another month in hopes of there not being as many people.  Boy, was I wrong.  I walked in and there weren't any open seats left in the waiting area.  The waiting area is huge, too.  We watied for awhile and considered leaving to try it again some other time (again) but they finally seated us.   The decor was pretty and extravagant.  Always something interesting to look at on the wall while you're waiting to order.  The seats are comfortable to sit.  We had a friendly and attentive server.  I'm not being biased either since our waiter was gorgeous.  Ladies, the next time you go there, try to sit in Shane's section.  Wow.   I ordered fettucine alfredo and it was so good!  My mom had a Caesar salad and also really liked it.  The menu also has a lot of variety.  It took us awhile to decide on what to eat and looking around, I could see other people mulling over their menus for quite some time.  I was very impressed with Cheesecake Factory and looking forward to eating there again."
Ismara C.,"Lincoln, CA",39,5,,5.0,4/10/2010,Such a kid friendly restaurant. Hostess asked me before my husband even brought our 1 yr old to the table if I wanted some bread and bananas for her. YES please!!!!
Jim S.,"Citrus Heights, CA",0,27,,4.0,2/16/2011,"We love this place. Never had a bad meal here. Ever. The food is always consistantly good. The waitstaff is awesome! Huge menu, but for some reason I always get the Chiken Costelleta. Oh, I know why...becasue it's amazing. The portions are so big that I eat half and take the rest home for another meal later in the week. Our kids love the pizza and my wife really enjoys the Breaded Shrimp. Everyone is happy when ""family dinner night out"" is at the Cheescake Factory!"
