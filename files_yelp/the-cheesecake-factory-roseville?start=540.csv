Vanessa S.,"Fair Oaks, CA",29,9,,5.0,6/2/2011,"My boyfriend and I went here for our date night. We haven't been to a Cheesecake Factory for about 5 years and my boyfriend wasn't thrilled about going here again. I had to basically twist his arm to get him to go eat here. We got there and the host said there would be a 5 -10 min wait. In about 2 minutes, our name was called and we were seated. Our waitress came over and took our drink order and brought us some bread and butter. I liked the sourdough and my boyfriend liked the other dark kind..don't know the name of it. It was nice to have a choice of bread though. After we finished that basket, our waitress brought us another one right away, refilled our drinks and took our order. My strawberry lemonade I ordered was one of the best ever, and I only ever order strawberry lemonade at restaurants, so I know a good one when I taste one. Our food came out very quickly and looked delicious! I ordered the four cheese pasta with chicken and my boyfriend ordered the smokehouse bbq burger. I LOVED my pasta! It was filled with gooey cheesy deliciousness! Next time I will order it without the chicken, it didn't add anything to the pasta, except $2. My boyfriend also LOVED his burger. He said it was the best restaurant burger he ever had, which for him is very high praise! The fries weren't anything to write home about, but he said his burger more than made up for it. After stuffing our faces, and still having leftovers for tomorrow, we decided there was enough room in our bellies for a piece of cheesecake. We ordered the White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle Cheesecake. Two words come to mind...DEAR GOD! It was so rich, smooth and creamy. Then I ordered the Snickers Bar Cheesecake to go, as a surprise for my boyfriend to take home. Boy was he excited for that too! On our way home, I asked my boyfriend if he was happy we went there and if i was right to pick The Cheesecake Factory for our date night. He told me that I was right and that he was glad we tried it again! It's now on our favorite restaurant list!"
Christine T.,"San Francisco, CA",0,30,,4.0,1/10/2010,"I am a big fan of the Cheesecake Factory.  While some foodies dislike chain restaurants, the Cheesecake Factory always seems to hit the spot for me.   Not only is there every type of cheesecake you could possibly want, but the menu is huge and the variety of food offered is fabby.  Make sure you save room for dessert, or just skip right to ordering the cheesecake when you sit down (and skip dinner).   The staff was friendly and the curb-side takeout feature is definitely a plus."
Randolph A.,"Elk Grove, CA",21,57,19,4.0,1/12/2009,"So I've always been a fan of Cheesecake Factory ever since my first time eating at the one on top of Macy's Union Square in San Francisco. This place didn't have the same views but the food and of course the cheesecake made up for it... can't complain. My girl and I ate here Friday night with some friends and had pretty good tasting food along with great service.  Just like any Cheesecake Factory... no matter where or what time of day, I swear there is always a wait... for us, it wasn't too bad... 15 minutes or so and we were seated. Our server, Mike, was prompt and friendly. He was also very helpful pointing out specials of the day and even some items not in the menu. But all of us kinda knew what we already wanted so we didn't get anything he suggested... maybe next time. Me and my girl ended up getting the Clam Chowder for an appetizer and the Crispy Chicken Costoletta for the main course.  The wait for the food wasn't too bad... I think it was because I was stuffing myself with the damn fresh complementary breads... not sure... but anyways the food came pretty quick. When we got our chicken, it looked hella good. It looked like it was breaded just right and it didn't look too oily either. When I took a bite, it was crispy on the outside and moist on the inside... it was pretty good. The only thing though was the lemon juice was a little too damn overpowering. Whatever sauce they mixed with the lemon juice, I think I tasted more lemon than the chicken itself. So I didn't use much of the sauce but still enjoyed the chicken. The asparagus was to really fresh. It was crunchy as hell and it was full of flavor... and it wasn't from the lemon juice. The mashed potatoes were pretty good too. As for the clam chowder... it was descent... I think I'm spoiled from Boudin's Clam Chowder in San Francisco... I haven't found anything better than that yet.  Overall our server was on point the whole night, filling up the waters for everyone and checking on us once in awhile to see if we were doing okay. So far, I've always been happy with Cheesecake Factory's service... and I've mostly been very happy with their cheesecake! After eating that big dinner, I didn't have room for cheesecake so I brought it home. My favorites are the Tiramisu and the Pistachio Chocolate Swirl. Damn they're GOOD!"
S. H.,"Auburn, CA",0,15,,4.0,4/20/2012,"Delicious food with portions large enough to split between my daughter and myself.  A favorite for our ""girls lunch"" out."
Derrick W.,"Gridley, CA",71,44,1,2.0,10/23/2011,Management team needs to be fired.  Server brings out a medium rare steak and it looks well done. Manager comes out and says that we must of ordered it wrong. They take another 20 min to bring a new steak and then charge full price for the steak.  Once we complain they offer a free piece of cheesecake. I told them they could have their cheesecake and left.  I guess they are really not concerned about what customers think.  There are many other great restaurants in Roseville to choose over this place.
Emily C.,"Antelope, CA",153,78,10,2.0,5/25/2011,"i love cheesecake factory, but i have been to this location for the 2nd time now and i was disappointed... my friends and i wanted a seat close to the bar so we could watch the NBA playoffs... well, they said yes they would save it, but unfortunately a stupid hostess wasn't listening very well. so that basically made our dinner not so good. btw, there were plenty of seating available to sit the other people elsewhere... the foods great though, but staff is not so great."
Jason R.,"Lincoln, CA",1,18,3,4.0,2/16/2012,"We have been here a half dozen times since its opening.  We enjoy the decor, the staff and the food.  I understand that cheese cake is their specialty, but $7 for a slice of cheese cake is a little extreme, but it is good.  Definitely recommend going."
Regan C.,"Cupertino, CA",28,206,7,5.0,7/13/2008,"Who says chain restaurants can't have great food? Every Cheesecake Factory I go to, I am impressed, this new Roseville location included. Yes, it might be crowded, but the food is worth the wait. The large menu lets me try something new everytime. This time I tried the Jambalaya Cajun Pasta and Fried Crab Wontons - awesome! I only wish there was one next to my house. Cheesecakes don't disappoint either - this time I got the Tiramisu and if you like mocha/coffee, you'll love this one too!"
Dave N.,"Roseville, CA",33,51,1,3.0,2/24/2009,"I just ordered the appetizer sampler for 30 bucks and it was pretty good, nothing really special, it was large enough for two people to share.  Next time I will order some main entres to see if they are better."
Natasha N.,"Antelope, CA",8,49,4,3.0,2/21/2009,The food is always tasty and the wait staff is really nice and knows a lot and give good suggestions.  I just don't like the cheesecake there! Horribly isn't it?  Their cocktails are always good.  I especially like the pom margarita it was very good.
Kevin L.,"San Jose, CA",5,46,,1.0,3/22/2013,"Absolutely the WORST service I have ever experienced in a restaurant. Lazy, rude and not service oriented. We were seated for 10 minutes before our server came and recognized our table telling us that he would be right back, 5 minutes later he returned to grab our drink order. 5 minutes later he returned with half of our drinks and bread which tipped over on his wet tray and then put on the table. When I told him that we would not accept the bread off of his tray he put up an argument informing me that the trays are sanitized after each use - I worked in food for 6 years, doesn't matter if your tray came right out of dishwasher - food should never touch it, he finally took the bread back. My brother ordered a sweetened green tea, it took 10 minutes longer for this drink to come out - I was able to have my water refilled by the time my brother got his ice tea, and my refill wasn't done by our server. So 30 minutes in we now have drinks, and our server continues to not be around, we manage to get him over to grab our dinner order and at the end he finally introduces himself as Micheal and takes off to the kitchen. During the 45 minutes our food was cooking Michael refilled a few of our drinks and got my brother another ice tea within 2 minutes of requesting it, why'd it take so long the first time??? Finally food came out - my brother gets shorted again- wrong order, my mother- missing sides. A manager, Mike, comes over and attempts to figure out what was wrong with the order, it is then that we informed Mike of the horrible service we had received, Michael overheard this and attempted to interject quickly being cut off by his manager and my brother. Manager Mike tried very hard to fix things, it wasn't happening though, by this point we were so frustrated with the lack of service we had received there was nothing he could do to make our dinner better. We will not be returning to this location again."
alexandra n.,"Roseville, CA",8,13,,5.0,5/18/2008,"ok, let's start by saying: i'm not cheesecake's biggest fan. but my experience tonight made me a believer. there was a 1.5 hour wait, but i was with family that really wanted to have dinner there, so we waited. there were a couple things i found to be a little strange: there were two employees cleaning the waiting area, which, let's be honest, is great, but one guy actually asked us to move so he could mop the floor. strange? thought so too. the music at one point became a little shriek-y as it was turned up to be above the chatter of patrons.  the turning point? our waiter, jenna.  from the beginning, she was personable, honest, and genuine. we asked her opinion on different dishes, and she was right-on. she gave us her real opinion sparing us the oh-too-common ""oh, EVERYTHING'S grrrrrreat here!"" thanks, jenna. oh, did i mention she has one of the most impressive restaurant resumes i've ever seen? she's worked at the best of them, ruthschris, she was a regional trainer for bj's, and worked at hawks... all impressive restaurants in their own right.  our glasses were always full, we were attended to by multiple waitpeople, and our food-- all across the board (pasta, crab cake sandwich, quesadilla, roasted eggplant sandwich and a chicken rice dish-- something for everyone) were all fabulous. we also tried the long island (which my husband, not a lightweight, was impressed by), an el diablo, and a pomegranate margarita... all great.  in the end, we had such fabulous service and our food was much better than i remember my last cheesecake experience to be that i could not possibly give the roseville cheesecake anything less than 5 stars. (you guys have jenna to thank!!!)"
A K.,"El Dorado Hills, CA",44,309,18,4.0,11/17/2008,"This place is really good and they have good seating. I like the food and my order was there biggest burrito, server was surprised once i finished the burrito i was expecting it on the house ha ha as i finished it but had to pay ..:). it was good joke with the server. the desserts are 2 good should try tiramasu for sure."
Star G.,"Earth, TX",1,172,,3.0,12/9/2008,The Cheesecake is the star! Try the only one on the menu that has Macadamia Nuts. It is Five-Star cheesecake. ...The overall food though is not for me.
michelle b.,"Shingle Springs, CA",0,5,,5.0,2/11/2011,"This place is awesome! The restaurant is beautiful inside. The wait staff is friendly, and accomodating and quick with service. The menu--if you can't find something you like here, something is wrong with you! The portions are giant and the prices are moderate. The cheesecake is awesome!!! We especially love the lemon raspberry one- yum!!"
Jose M.,"Yuba City, CA",0,15,,5.0,4/23/2013,"went to happy hour, place was packed. i think its a pricy happy hour but our food and drinks were great. cheesecake was bomb"
Charles G.,"Folsom, CA",0,11,10,3.0,10/13/2008,"Realistically, the reviews of this place are far too high. I think this is because people that ought to be reviewing it won't step in the door. That's probably a bit extreme too, as an occasional visit is OK. What we have here is, then, is the Windows XP of restaurants. It represents All That Is Wrong with suburban restaurants and, even more, the people frequenting them. Yet it isn't Windows Vista-bad (though highly bloated). The foulness is more subversive than at surface. The food is decent enough, the staff quite friendly, and it seems to cater well to the target audience. The problem, though, is that this kind of ""good enough"" becomes so popular that it steals a slice of banana-cream cheesecake from the independents pushing for something better. And that's why I went there...because my dining group didn't want to ""risk"" my suggestions. Somebody said ""Cheesecake Factory""...and that was it."
Francis J.,"San Jose, CA",0,79,,4.0,3/12/2013,"been to other locations of cheesecake so this isnt my first time but it is my first time at this location. got seated after 5 minutes, good timing that we had arrived at 6pm and after we walked in everyone else started to come in. got seated and our waitress was very nice and very quick with the refills! i thnk her name was katherine. she always checked up on us and everything. ordered calamari which is never a let down, some artichokes which my mother said were good and i had ordered the new orleans shrimp..which was good also but i could have gone without the sausage. got full to quick since ate so much calamari and the free bread! yum!  ordered a cheesecake togo a banana creme one, when i ate it at the hotel i thought there was almond in it but it happened to be wax paper! ha no biggie i guess. all in all good experience and friendly envoirnment."
Melanie B.,"Loomis, CA",7,48,60,4.0,3/5/2010,"This was my first time going to the Galleria location and I was pleasantly pleased. My boyfriend and I went on a Monday around 2:00 and there obviously weren't many people there. We were sat in the bar area and our server was also the bartender and his name was 'Old School'...I thought that was pretty interesting. He definitely 'schooled' us on what was good, and we ended up getting one of the appetizers he had recommended (some kind of artichoke and crab dip) and it was delish! The crab flavor was amazing and complimented the chunks of artichoke throughout. I ordered the stuffed chicken tortillas and they were fantastic! The chicken was shredded and the tomatillo sauce was supurb! My favorite part was the grilled corn cakes that came with it...YUM! My boyfriend had the Cuban sandwich, which he enjoyed, but wasn't blown away. We then finished off lunch with a banana creme cheesecake and with the recommendation from our server once again, the red velvet cheesecake....HOLY SH*T! THE best piece of cheesecake I have ever had! Overall, great service, great food, and a fantastic dessert!"
L D.,"Willmar, MN",1,22,,1.0,9/27/2010,"The food was great!  The service was to worst.  We ate at the tall tables in the bar.  We had 2 waiters introduce them selves as our waiter.  The salad was served and not even three minutes later, the entree was served.  Drink refills were slow to come.  Most of the staff stood in the corner and talked with the bar tender.  I would never go back and  a spend that much money again."
