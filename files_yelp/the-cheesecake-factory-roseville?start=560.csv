Sherry W.,"Placerville, CA",0,29,,1.0,9/18/2012,"Previously I would have given a positive rating as the food is pretty good but this last visit is my last. I was there Saturday afternoon about 3, eating a meal in the bar area. During the entire meal the busboy was sweeping the floor around and under our table, hitting our chairs while doing so. This went on for awhile, then stopped and then he came back again (no, we were not messy!). We asked him nicely to get the manager which he did and we told the manager it was irritating and not hygienic and after he made excuses for it he apologized and bought us a free desert. Then two guys come with mops and water and proceeded to mop around our table with stinky water. I couldn't believe it and took it as direct insult from the manager. We never asked for a comp or anything, just not to be bothered while eating...they could have cleaned the area near us. We asked for the manager again and another one came and made the same excuses, didn't seem to care when we said we had mop handles in our faces. We paid our bill and left a good tip but told he we would never return. He didn't seem to care. We were never rude, only decent patrons looking for a nice drink and meal."

Brandi R.,"Roseville, CA",3,14,,2.0,5/19/2009,"I haven't been in a while but here's why... Overpriced, didn't like the quality of the dishes at all.  We had 2 apps and 2 entree's plus drinks.  Drinks were watered down.  I would give them 4 stars for just their cheesecake - because it is damn great cheesecake, but let's face it, I only get to have cheesecake about once a year at most, so I have to rate them on the rest of their food because that's where I'm spending my money.  Not worth it to me.  Outdoor dining is so sad because you're sitting on the edge of a parking lot, not far from the loading dock.  What designer thought people would enjoy that?  Ugh."
Kyle S.,"Nevada City, CA",3,64,4,5.0,3/17/2009,We always time our visits to Cheesecake Factories for late afternoon so we DON'T have to wait...it's just the way it is folks. We had 4 of 4 totally love our meals. I usually order the Kobe Burger but this time I tried the Shrimp/Chicken Curry dish and it was outstanding. Our servers were more than good. The nice thing in this room is that you can hear yourself and to me that's what's keeping me from places like BJ's...never again there.
