Greg C.,"Suisun City, CA",73,19,38,1.0,2/19/2017,"I had to reinstall Yelp... this is how disappointed I was tonight.  After calling and speaking with the manager I felt like he didn't care to make anything right. Anthony didn't handle this situation the way you would expect for spending so much. My waiter David was disrespectful I felt and the manager didn't care. The price was not okay for the lack of service, probably won't be back for a long time... PS The host went above and beyond, but the waiter lacked in major areas."
Dandyd S.,"Antelope, CA",28,154,23,4.0,9/8/2017,"First time at a Cheesecake Factory.  Lots of choices on the menu.  Food was tasty, no complaints. Server was very nice and friendly, even though he had other busy tables.  I can see why people are big fans of theirs.  Nice place if you want to enjoy your food and linger, not feel rushed out the door."
Cheley P.,"Fair Oaks, CA",1,9,,5.0,10/7/2017,My boyfriend and I came to eat dinner at the cheesecake factory. Dinner was great as always but we had exceptional service from Judith! She made our dinner and visit memorable! Thank you for making our evening!
Who D.,"Citrus Heights, CA",1,42,92,4.0,6/6/2017,"We heard nothing but good things about this place, so my wife and I decided to come and try it. Clean, although somewhat loud. Our service was already messed up when we asked for lemon slices but our server, Megan, claimed she didn't hear us even though we both repeated our drinks to her. It was good yo see it was quickly remedied by her prompt return of lemon slices. Now dinner: I ordered the fish and chips and my wife ordered skinny chicken salad sandwich, of which both were delicious! We didn't have dessert because we were both so very full. I totally recommend this place to anyone. One thing that does suck: no wifi, oh well, it was a great experience nonetheless."
James K.,"San Jose, CA",158,95,402,4.0,10/24/2016,I always enjoy the miso salmon at Cheesecake Factory Recommended  Wait is a bit long but worth it!
Kim H.,"Rocklin, CA",61,105,31,2.0,3/9/2017,"I can honestly say (honest, imagine that!) that my review is based on their service, not so much the food itself. We have had three visits in the past year, with exception to ""date night"" where it was just my Husband and myself, the other two times we had a part of 8, and a party of 11.  On both the occasions where we were with large parties, our WAIT time was over 2 hours.  That being said, it is understandable that there would be a wait.  The first time, it was a FAMILY gathering, we were told multiple different times that our table would be ""coming soon.""  After the 5th time you've heard that, you start getting irked.  On the second occasion, it was the evening of Sierra College graduation, and it rained that night prompting the ceremony to be cleared due to rain/lightening.  When we arrived, we were told an hour wait, by the time we were seated, it was 2 hours and 26 minutes later.  The ""thing"" that really bothers me is the REPEATED TIMES we were given, ""Your table should be ready soon.""  No, it wasn't.  Now, my vision of customer service (especially on visit # 3 where the MANAGER became involved) there was NO offer of free appetizer, dessert......nothing.  THAT is not good customer service. The food was VERY slow coming out, and 3 orders were wrong.  The server was EXCELLENT, so we brushed it off and adhered to our 18% tip policy.  Now, ONE of those entrees should have been given FREE of charge, but again, NOTHING. We won't go with large groups ever again, perhaps just our date nights.  Hoping that any Manager seeing this review considers the ""wording"" to large parties as far as when their table might be ready.   The food is typically pretty good, even if I don't eat cheesecake!"
L S.,"Santa Rosa, CA",29,67,,4.0,7/23/2017,"We stopped in around 11pm after visiting the waterpark that was close by. Friendly service and food/drinks were good. Love the hot chocolate: not to sweet. The Long Island was Delicious. And OMG the Shepard's pie is pretty freaking good. Pastas are OK and the wait time is average. I unfortunately did not get any cheesecake, as my boyfriend does not like eating it. The apple crisp is delightful .. we had to pack it up as our eyes were bigger than out stomachs. All in all..good food, good atmosphere and good service."
Mike D.,"Sacramento, CA",70,7,1,1.0,9/22/2017,I'm very disappointed this evening.. normally our favorite place to eat for a celebration or date night. Tonight was my birthday and my fiancé wanted to take me out. I always get the same thing.. Parmesan crusted chicken. Tonight was horrible it was the worst preparation I have ever had.. it was beyond soggy to the point that it was mush on a piece of chicken. The waiter was at no fault and we were very polite about it. I told him I didn't wanna send it back because I know what happens when you complain about food.. however he ensured me it was no issue. I agreed he could have them remake it. Shortly after I believe it was a supervisor that came up and apologized about the inconvenience and assured me it would come out perfect! I said thank you and about 10 min later a fresh order came out. Before the waiter left he said how is this.. I took my fork and scraped off a puddle of breading.. it was way worse than the first time! At that point I lost my appetite. My fiancé had stopped eating waiting for me to get the remake.. so now her food had been sitting for 20 min. The waiter took my food back and the supervisor came back and said we took it off your bill and had it grilled up more.. we ended up leaving the remade food because it was still mush and wasn't happy at all.. so we received the bill and paid it.. still tipped 15% because it wasn't the waiters fault.. still ended up paying almost 60 bucks..  2 sodas  1 potsticker order 2 pieces of cheese cake Her lettuce wraps. Very disappointed and probably won't be returning. The staff was nice. I'm not one to write reviews often but I had to.. sorry Cheese cake factory.. you have failed us..
Robbie R.,"Rocklin, CA",15,322,991,2.0,3/11/2017,"This Cheesecake Factory is located right at the Roseville Galleria Shopping Center along with other upscale chain restaurants. I only came here cause a friend dragged me in here, she really like the place. For me, it seemed just too busy, not too many people wise, but the atmosphere I found far from relaxing. The service was fast and efficient and all bubbly in a rehearsed chain restaurant kind of way. The menu is huge to so many choices it's too had to decide. We started with the fried calamari for $13. It was a pretty standard prep and similar to what most sports bar make, but $13 , I thought was a bit high. For my lunch, I had Fish and Chips $18 and my friend had the Chinese Chicken Salad for $15. The food was tasty enough, nothing to make me gush, but the prices for what you get sort of left a sour taste in my mouth, like I sort of felt ripped off by our $60 lunch with tax and tip and all I got was Fish and chips and a shared appetizer of calamari."
David L.,"Granite Bay, CA",0,23,4,2.0,7/1/2016,"Very conflicted about this review. This has been the only chain restaurant I usually enjoy. But things seem to be changing. Had curbside a few times lately and each time a complete disaster. One order had more than seven different mistakes on it including salad sizes wrong, incorrect burger, dish with pasta instead of rice, fries not delivered at all, and more. W called and the manager started interrupting after each complaint we told, trying to explain something or other, until she realized how bad their mistakes had been. This was during the NBA finals dip their entire staff must have not been paying attention. Really bad bad experience. Tried again last night. Found a nice sized bug in the salad. Made finishing the meal a bit difficult. They can't Be washing the lettuce there. Photo included.  This is usually a reliable chain. Someone better get I there and fix things soon."
Kat D.,"Meridian, ID",147,179,150,4.0,1/4/2017,"I generally always order the same dish from The Cheesecake Factory every time I come because the menu is so extensive & I just have way too many options to choose from. However, last night I was feeling brave and ordered something different....the mac & cheese burger.  Oh em gee!! It was so amazing & perfect & cheesy & delicious! Basically, it's a chargrilled burger on a grilled roll topped with a deep fried patty of fried mac & cheese and then sliced cheese on top of that.  It is served with shredded lettuce, tomato, pickle, & onion on the side. This burger has got to be the best burger I have ever eaten. I always make sure to order a slice of cheesecake to eat when I get home. CF is one of those places that will satisfy just about anyone's craving. Don't forget to eat the brown bread!! It's to die for! The only negatives are: Limited seating in the lobby area The restaurant is LOUD The restaurant is pretty dark.  The lobby gets to be really crowded & it makes it difficult for the servers to pick up Cheesecake from the cheesecake counter.  Other than that, CF is great! I appreciate the home style cooking & homey atmosphere. The food is consistent and good.  I really wish the buzzer they give you when you are waiting for a table had the option to allow someone to leave & go walk around the mall while waiting."
jamie s.,"Fair Oaks, CA",119,93,253,4.0,1/1/2017,"What's not to love? Tasty eats and a lot of cheesecakes! I am a big fan of the Cheesecake Factory especially when I'm shopping. I know I can walk over and sit down to a meal that will be delivered with great care and efficiency. Truly , for a big company,I think they have the right to brag about their excellent service.  I order the chopped salad. It's the size a small family salad. It seems endless and I love it! Great dressing! I'm already full from the slightly sweet brown bread and butter I've indulged in before my salad arrived.   Side note: the white chicken chili is yummmmy! It's my other go to. I generally order it sans rice to save on calories .  Also happy hour is a great deal and very plentiful portions."
Yolanda R.,"Yuba City, CA",243,452,13362,4.0,10/14/2015,"I've been coming to this Location for about 4 years now...  Really like the area because it is conveniently located at Westfield Galleria and there is so much to do in the area!  Many nice places to check out, shop, visit, eat, etc. They do not do Free slices of cheesecake for your Birthday, but will sing for you and give a complimentary scoop of ice cream with candle.  Right now they have the Pumpkin Pecan cheesecake available through November, and then usually December is the Peppermint Bark cheesecake.  They have such a large variety of cheesecakes to choose from and many of them are very delicious! I came in for Lunch, and usually I prefer lunch service than dinner service.  It's always busy, crowded no matter what day or time you come here ...  and on their Menu you can order anything at anytime!  I love the Ahi Tartare appetizer, it's very tasty, pretty presentation, and nice flavors of the soy sauce with Avocado, ginger, Ahi tuna.  I tend to always order the same thing to eat, either the Steak Diane or Chicken Madeira.  Those are definitely my top 3 favorite choices.  Haven't tried many other items on their menu yet, but I did have Brunch at Sacramento Arden, which they do have an awesome Sunday Brunch menu. As for cheesecakes, I usually try to order a different one each time I go there and haven't been disappointed yet.  I tried the Pumpkin one last year, so I know that is great!  Salted Caramel was OK.  So far my most favorites are the Tuxedo and Red Velvet, but want to try so many more!!!!  Yesterday was actually the first time I ever ordered Cheesecake a la mode.  I guess I was expecting only one scoop of ice cream, but it came with two scoops of Vanilla ice cream.  Definitely could not finish it :(  I really enjoyed the Red Velvet cheesecake with the ice cream, it was perfectly delicious together.  You can also purchase whole cheesecakes, they are kind of expensive.  I am thinking about ordering a whole one for Christmas this year, if my family can make a decision on what flavor to pick!  They have so many cheesecake flavors, it's a long list... Lunch was great as always.  I highly recommend the Steak Diane, though on menu I thought it said $17.95, and my receipt was $19.95, so prices may have increased recently.  Hostess was Welcoming and I have a preference where I like to sit, which she gladly accommodated me.  My server was friendly, attentive, polite.  She did a great job and was helpful to kindly box up the leftovers.  The inside of the restaurant, design and colors are quite beautiful.  Hopefully will be back around December and Christmas shopping, definitely want a slice of Peppermint bark cheesecake too!"
Sarah R.,"Sacramento, CA",1,33,25,2.0,7/12/2017,"I love coming to Cheesecake Factory and indulging in huge portions of pasta, but after this experience I won't be coming back for a while. It took about 15 minutes for our bread to come out and the appetizer we ordered never showed up. I was told I could sub out peas for mushrooms in the Chipotle Pasta and was then charged $2 extra for the mushrooms and was still served the peas. The whole experience took way too long and I'll be going to other places for pasta from now on."
Angel F.,"Roseville, CA",239,67,260,1.0,6/8/2017,"Im giving them 1 star for their ladies behind the cheesecake counter. I was Door Dashing and I requested for an order of cheesecake for myself. Unfortunately they refuse to assist me due to me being a Door Dasher waiting for food to pick up. They decided to assist me after I receive the dasher's order, but I was asking for a cheesecake seperate from the dasher's order. They decided to put the customer behind me first. And then, after receiving the Dasher's order, they questiones about my request for extra napkins & utensils. They were skeptical in giving me extra but I requested it as part of me being a Door Dasher & that it is required we do so to keep our customer happy! In all.. I wasn't happy with their attitude and approach for customer service!"
Ksusha P.,"Fair Oaks, CA",0,23,9,4.0,4/22/2017,Nice place to spend ur evening:)  they have good fresh squeezed orange juice.  Always have it when I'm here.
Lysa D.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",33,274,89,4.0,1/18/2017,We always order the ahi tuna carpacchio and its always delicious. We sat at the bar instead of waiting 20 min for a table. Service was good and food is always good.
Kenny W.,"Suisun City, CA",448,118,46,2.0,11/23/2016,"The wait was ridiculous. When a place is this busy I think they should think about providing there customers with small cheese cake bites while waiting or offer water to those waiting in the lobby or in front. Or have a water location that is infused with fruits or something. Get creative. Hostess should update the top of the list ( 5 Names) how much longer so they can feel a little at ease while waiting instead of chit chatting among themselves and going on their phones. Which I get it we all do it. Wait times ruin the experiences at restaurants. Add a little candy or a water station to get customers to feel welcomed. I got water and totally forgot I was waiting long. Well not really, but it is worth a shot. The food was great. In this location. others not the same outcome.  Thank you Roseville, Cheesecake In response to Roseville Cheesecake. Yes we did go at a later time and have been in early and random times. I disagree and agree time can play a factor. It's a popular place to eat. It happens. Not much you can do, but have patience.  My goal was to provide some customer satisfaction ideas.  Because it's a great place to eat.  Regardless of the wait we still visit Cheesecake factories to eat.  Thank you for your response."
Lamees A.,"Sacramento, CA",19,27,88,4.0,1/25/2017,"I always love the service at cheesecake factory, top notch, food was a bit average this time around , i ordered the egg Benedict and husband the California omelette which had too much garlic in it and not edible, my husband didn't like it and said he wont be back but for me i still love this chain and enjoy the service and overall atmosphere."
Rick B.,"Rocklin, CA",0,2,,2.0,6/6/2017,"#2 After receiving your reply to my less than stellar review from last evening, I can see that it was just going through the motions. I read all the other posts and see that when someone didn't receive the kind of service we all expect from Cheesecake factory or any other (non fast food) average chain restaurants, the replies are copy and pasted. The promise to address the issues and limit the experience to an isolated one, is obviously not being done properly or at all. Someone who truly understands customer service should be put on the payroll and some serious training of staff should occur. After my personal experience was mishandled by both the server and manager on duty, I write to you to open your eyes and expect to receive a little more than oops we are sorry and we will do better next time. I find that I am disappointed yet again.  How my situation should have been handled is: After I informed you that the food was not prepared properly, the Manager should have made sure it was perfect the second time. The 2nd plate should have been made fresh with all side dishes fresh as well. This didn't happen! The 2nd dish came out looking worse than the first and even less meat than the first dish had. It was sloppily presented as well. When I pointed this out to the Manager who personally delivered the second dish, He should have apologized again, asked if he could have 1 more chance to make it right and then he should have not charged me for that dish. To go a step even further, he could have given me his business card and wrote some type of goodwill gesture on the card. Perhaps a discount on the next visit or a free appetizer or something that goes beyond minimum effort! If you all want to improve your service, you need to think outside the box. I would have written a wonderful review and praised your actions, had you handled the situation better.  I live in Rocklin, there are many good restaurants around. You were on my list of better restaurants. Please get with the program and see to it that improvements are made. PLEASE!  #1 I am so disappointed in the service I received this evening. My family and I met for dinner. I arrived early and had a few martini's. Once my wife and daughter arrived we ordered dinner. I ordered the medallions medium rare. It arrived dry and gray in color. Very well done. I don't like to complain but wanted to enjoy the meal. I decided to mention the meat was overcooked to my waitress. Her reply......""Let me send it back, I didn't cook it!"" ??? What? My family tries to wait but didn't want to let their food get cold or soggy. They finished their meals. Finally a manager came over and apologized for the overcooked order. I mentioned the response I received from the waitress. The Manager said he would speak with her. 15 minutes later the manger hand delivered my newly cooked dish. The meat was again dry and gray in color. The mashed potatoes were dry and appeared to be from my original order. I hurried to cut two medallions in half showing the manager how the meat was cooked well done again. He looked at me with a look that told me he was done helping me. I said the meat is still over cooked and the meal appeared to be dry overall. I received a blank stare from the manager. I said we'll, I don't have more time to wait for yet another replacement meal. The manager just walked away. Soon after the waitress returned and stated; she was sorry for her remark and added usually people laugh at her remark that she didn't cook the meal. I looked at my wife and daughter in disbelief. Is this customer service at Cheesecake Factory? I think not!  "
