Shelaine M.,"Roseville, CA",0,8,,1.0,3/17/2017,"While I've enjoyed Cheesecake Factory in the past I feel their quality in food and service has declined. My main complaint is for the take out. My husband and I had a gift card and decided to order out since it was a Friday and packed. I got there and I had to wait in line 30 minutes because you pick you food up at the same counter where they have customers indecisively picking out cheesecake. Especially as a pregnant woman, this was no fun. The wait also meant that our food was even more cold and stale by the time we got to actually eat it. My husband turkey burger had a massive amount of grilled onions on it, my roast dip was way too salty, and put fries were hard. Everything had that greased glazed on it and we spent $31 on the 2 meals.  Also, the last time we dinned there our waitress messed up every part of our order possible and they weren't even busy."
Jennifer B.,"Sacramento, CA",218,27,13,4.0,1/7/2017,Haven't been to this location in about 7 years but they still didn't disappoint and our waitress Alexa was amazing!!!   I ordered my favorite the crab won tons and had the beet and goat cheese salad and it was amazing!!!
Madison S.,"Antelope, CA",0,3,,4.0,10/28/2017,Love this place!! Every time I have been I have gotten great customer service and the food is okay as well. I mostly continue to go for the service and raspberry lemonade!! I wish I could remember all of my amazing servers names that I've had there!
Danny F.,"Roseville, CA",7,5,,1.0,10/27/2017,"I normally enjoy this restaurant. However, i barely started eating when I found obvious hair in my chicken Madeira the manager was not professional. The manager was loud and embarrassed us in front of the people around us. They wouldn't give me a new dish or even comp it. I won't be recommending this place or going here anymore."
Grace G.,"Roseville, CA",43,316,912,4.0,10/7/2015,"I don't usually eat here. It's always too crowded. Wide variety of food selection so the food is above sub par. But, my first time trying the one in Roseville and I was pleasantly surprised.  Yes, there was a ridiculous line...but we got lucky and found two spots at the bar. Our bartender won our hearts with his amazing...AMAZING...A-MAZE-ING!!! Lemon drop martinis! I like to consider myself a professional when it comes to lemon drops...yeah, his was damn good. We had like four of them! Lol.  After drinks, decided we should eat...I ordered the tempora fish tacos. I don't think the alcohol was talking. Those tacos were pretty good too! But our experience was super pleasant with our incredibly personable, funny, and friendly bartender.  As a resident of Roseville, I have officially added the Cheesecake Factory to my official roster of go to spots to eat...I will just be sure to valet and look for the bar. :)"
Ursula O.,"Lincoln, CA",1046,288,720,2.0,3/14/2016,"The night started out great... We arrived about 10:30 with a 15 to 20 minute wait-which was accurate. It was a good crowd for Friday night.  There isn't much of a waiting area. Maybe 2 benches that sit comfortably for 2. We awkwardly stood in front of the to go area. There was a case of stuffed animals with the names of some of their cheesecake on them... they were cute. It was elegant and the designs on the wall were intriguing. It was like walking into an art gallery with designs everywhere... When our buzzer lit up, they sat us toward the right side of the restaurant. It was a very cozy table. After a few minutes, we ordered an appetizer-the zucchini sticks and a bacon burger to split. It came with 2 kinds of bacon-thick candied bacon and crispy bacon. Sounded great! We asked that they not put on the ""secret sauce."" Our waitress was very attentive, very nice.  She brought us bread and butter and a few minutes later, we got our zucchini sticks. The zucchini sticks were great, but the ranch tasted sour. So next time, I'm bringing my own ranch, lol! We finish all of our zucchini sticks by the time the burger made it out. We had received an extra plate so that we can split it ourselves. As we checked out the amazing looking burger....AND found that damn secret sauce on it! So we told the waitress, and a manager made her way out to let us know they were working on another one. We sat about 10 minutes waiting for our remake. When it came out, a manager delivered it. :-) We check for the no sauce on the burger, cut the thing in half. ... 2 bites in, I thought I had hair in my mouth....but couldn't really find it unless I wanted to split my food out and inspect it. Plus, I only thought. When I looked back at my plate, sure enough, there was a dark hair on my plate. Trying to convince myself it was mine, I tried to pick it...but it had been intertwined in my burger. It was thin, about 4 or 5 inches long and absolutely not mine. My husband watched as I wrapped it around my hand to pull it out of my burger.  Disgusting!  We stopped eating, they apologized and asked if we wanted anything else.  Not really. I THINK I HAD PART OF THAT HAIR IN MY MOUTH! They did offer us a slice of cheesecake, which we took home. It was the salted caramel.  We paid for our zucchini sticks and Steve's soda, which came out to $9.  Normally, this obviously would've been a 1 star review...but our waitress was so attentive and nice. The manager tried to fix things."
FoodLover C.,"Carmichael, CA",0,14,18,3.0,12/14/2016,This review is based on our food that we ordered. I had the hibachi steak and my girlfriend had the da vinci pasta. We also ordered the deep fried zucchini and avocado. Too much salt in our zucchini. We tried the fried mac n cheese and it was good. My steak was done medium rare. I didnt eat my mashed potato because i dont like mashed potato and I forgot to switch it with other sides. Deep fried asparagus is good. The hibachi steak is like steak topped with terriyaki sauce imo which is not a good combination. The outcome of my steak was a little bit sweet. I was expecting to taste at least a little of the wasabi.  The da vinci penne pasta of my girlfriend is somewhat okay but I'd recommend you to get a different pasta. It is lacking of taste and a kick. There was chicken and mushrooms but i feel like it is lacking of taste. I feel like I'd like to boil my pasta with salt and after sautéing my chicken and mushroom I'd simmer it with chicken broth and mix the penne pasta in it. Service is okay.  Ducle de leche cheesecake is super good without the whip cream.
K J.,"Sacramento, CA",5,18,,1.0,6/6/2017,"Came for a grad brunch on Saturday, 6/3: We were the first ones there so it wasn't busy yet. We had a party of 8. Service was slow. Food took over an hour to come out. Pasta was dry like it had been under the warmer for an hour, husband's chicken wings looked dehydrated with no sauce. When they brought out new wings, they had sauce on them, but were literally COLD to the touch. All other food was cold (eggs, ham, omelette). Husband never did get any food till we were leaving and it came in a box. When I got home I noticed they my ex-husband's leftovers in my bag and must've given mine to him. My dad got sick from the meal. I paid over $140 for crap. Never again. Stay classy Roseville."
Oscar P.,"Rocklin, CA",1,14,1,4.0,7/24/2017,"Great variety of food and nice clean environment, waiters were very nice and food was overall good. Cheesecake was a little bit overpriced in my opinion but no complains on the taste!"
Jason P.,"Davis, CA",1,6,,2.0,7/31/2017,"I use to like this cheese cake factory a lot, and came here quite often. I don't know what it is but things seems to have changed, not sure if its the quality or what but its not what it use to be. I hope the next time I'm back it will be the gem I remembered it to be"
Tom G.,"Benicia, CA",4,10,2,5.0,10/2/2016,"Just had drinks and a piece of their delicious cheesecake. We tried the Mango and it was delis! I ordered a Prosecco wine. They served a wonderful Italian Prosecco, GL Ruffino.  Amy C was our bartender. She was great and attentive."
Sally L.,"Placerville, CA",682,14,14,1.0,1/1/2017,Disappointed... again Over an hour wait time  Then we were told that our number was a duplicate and we'd have to wait longer...  5 people = $200 = too much for a mediocre meal and customer care
Stephen W.,"Reno, NV",0,26,,5.0,12/4/2016,"Billy, Jordan & The Nat WOO,WOO,WOO Great service, good food & great drinks. Watching each of these serving bartenders masterfully deal with ""challenging guests"" is always interesting. Seriously Natalie, Jordan and Billy will treat you cheerfully with respect and completely answer your food and beverage requests or questions. Good lunch specials and one very large menu to suit most any taste."
Alex S.,"Lincoln, CA",1,20,4,5.0,11/25/2016,"Did you know they'll give your kid a plate with sliced bananas and bread as soon as you get to your table for free? All the parents out there----Can I get an ""AMEN!?"" That earned them five stars for me, but also the service is above average. How do I know? I came in there at 5 til midnight about as drunk as Sailor Jerry himself and ordered beer and cheesecake. No judgement. By the way...I don't recommend that combo sober."
Gina K.,"Sacramento, CA",10,11,5,4.0,10/9/2017,Nice night at the restaurant. The food came out hot and the service was fine. The strawberry daiquiri was made well and relaxed me for the evening.
Linda M.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",2,14,2,1.0,5/12/2017,"Have been so humiliated in my life. This place needs to be shut down. No hygiene what so ever, hairs inside of the food. I called the manager Aida and she came all promising they will fix the mistake and take care of us and the bill, in any point never said she will cancel the order, and so we kept sitting there waiting for our food to arrive and guess what after an hour and fifteen minutes I've asked the bartender what's going on with the food and her normal response like she was acting like that with every and each customer ohh we didn't order new food for you because we were thinking you guys don't want to eat, sure all I wanted is to come to the cheesecake and sit on the bar having coke. This is ridiculous, how does the fact you got other people parts inside of my dish gets my dish cancelled and not get me the best customer service you could possibly give?!? Did I make the mistake? Was it my responsibility to check the dishes when they coming out of the kitchen or is it your job of the people who actually work there??? Again mistake are allowed to happen but you should fix them and no it's not the problem of the customer that you guys are exchanging shifts. I used to eat there at least once or twice a week but no more. Cheesecake Factory needs to ashamed of themselves. Important to mention that the manager of all the managers did try to make us feel Better but the offer he gave us was insulting. Offering us $50 gift card where I usually spend over 70 easily and this is without a cheesecake. Anyway for sure they have lost a customer"
Diva Q.,"Lincoln, CA",3,49,,2.0,6/7/2017,"Ammonia smelling hamburger so gross!!!! Oh my I had gone to celebrate with my mate because we met there years ago and it was an anniversary. We started with the sliders- the hamburger smelled like ammonia, I had better burger at way cheaper food places. It was so gross I spit it out. Smell the hamburger meat it is so gross. The waitress was fabulous and so were the drinks. The artichoke dip was somewhat cold. I was so grossed out by the meat hence when I got home I barfed. So much for my celebration. The place looks good inside but the food quality is cheappp. Never again going back. I am not really a picky with food but this is totally gross."
Mark M.,"Turlock, CA",0,30,4,3.0,9/23/2017,"As advertised, the cheesecake is great. We had a pizza, slim tacos, and shrimp pasta. The food was good but not great. Service was okay. Staff was friendly. Place was clean."
Ninahwee W.,"Stockton, CA",113,12,134,5.0,3/17/2017,"Exceptional service!!! Food was fresh, hot and both servers were so delightful. My husband ordered the Avocado salad and I ordered the southern fried Catfish. Delish! Will definitely repeat next time we're out this way! :)"
Tommy B.,"Orangevale, CA",90,5,,5.0,6/23/2017,I love this place! I eat here too damn much!  Foods great and the staff is on it! They make dealing with the rosevillians worth it.
