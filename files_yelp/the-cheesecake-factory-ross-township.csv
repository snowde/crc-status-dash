Eric T.,"McKnight, PA",0,3,,4.0,10/26/2017,"Generally do a great job but I've got a rant.  You changed the eggplant parm dish.  The new dish is awful.  Please go back to your old preparation.  I'm guessing the new one comes straight from a freezer to the microwave to your table which is the reason for the change.  The previous dish was beautifully prepared.  I liked it so much I had most of my family ordering it as well.   Lastly, I've enjoyed some very nice meals at the bar.  Can't recall the gal's name but she is a gem and I've gone back just because of her.   I'm going to give 4 stars as I think you do a good job but you have to fix that eggplant dish."
Tim W.,"Pittsburgh, PA",2562,525,595,2.0,8/20/2017,"I have been coming to The Cheesecake Factory for over twenty years and I left truly disappointed.  My wife and I had a rare Saturday night to ourselves so I decided to take her out to eat after putting up with me at the Nordstrom Anniversary sale. Once we arrived there was a 25 to 30 minute wait which I didn't mind. Once our pager went off we almost literally broke our necks walking to our table as the floor was so slippery.  Once seated our waitress Meghan came and took our drink orders. We hadn't been to a Cheesecake Factory in a while so it was nice to see some new items on the menu. When we finally decided what we wanted I chose the Pasta with Shrimp and Sausage and my wife chose the Chicken Chipotle Pasta. A few minutes later Meghan came back with our bread. 10 to 15 minutes later Meghan came back and said that our food would be coming soon. By this time a few other groups had been seated and placed their orders as well. Another twenty five minutes later we still have no food. All of the other tables around us had gotten their drinks, appetizers and entrees and we still had nothing! Finally we got our food almost 45 minutes after being seated. We did not order appetizers just entrees so we had bread and water until our food finally came. By this time I was really feeling some type of way! At least our food as good! After I got our check and paid I was going to just let it go but I couldn't so I asked to speak to the manager. Once she came over I let her know what happened. I let her know they we had been come to the Cheesecake Factory for over twenty years and never once had to wait that long for food. She apologized and offered us a piece of cheesecake. I usually enjoy the Cheesecake Factory, but after this experience, I don't know when or if I will return."
Kelly V.,"Pittsburgh, PA",96,35,123,4.0,1/7/2018,"While it was super busy, Kelsey and I walked in and were seated right away. We started with the bread and butter (we both love the brown bread) followed by the Mac & Cheese appetizer. It's huge! It comes with four pieces total. Very good! I had the Farfalle chicken pasta with garlic. I've had this dish before and today it was just okay. Overall we have a great lunch."
Erica S.,"Pittsburgh, PA",51,78,62,4.0,1/10/2018,This visit I ordered the veggie burger and the side salad. The veggie burger has a really good taste to it. It's made out of black beans and rice and It comes with lettuce tomato onion and pickles on it. I added mushrooms because I put them on everything as well it came with a piece of cheese. The only thing about the burger is that it breaks apart easily. The salad is really fresh and comes with pieces of tomato and I believe little peppers. The balsamic that they toss it with is very VERY light. Just tasted like wet lettuce. I still have them a 4 Star because they normally have excellent food.
Kelsey V.,"Hollsopple, PA",111,3,10,4.0,1/7/2018,A Vann sister favorite! The Cheesecake Factory always is a big hit with us. Today I got the Louisiana Chicken pasta and split the Fried Mac & Cheese Balls with my sister. The pasta has a nice kick to it and breading on the chicken is light and crunchy. The only downside today was I found a dark long hair in my pasta. The Mac & Cheese was fantastic as always though.
Gwen K.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,20,13,5.0,1/1/2018,Even tho the price is high but it worth every penny. Sometimes I just go there to buy cake. The only downside is the wait. Line is always long. Not just here and every Cheesecake Fac.
Roya G.,"Pittsburgh, PA",128,7,11,4.0,1/5/2018,"Ahhh the cheesecake factory. An absolute nightmare for indecisive people like myself. 3 menus (regular, special, and skinnylicious) for me to debate over until I just about give up and order something spontaneous because the waitress has visited my table 3 times now asking if I ""still need more time"". And that begins our tale. My fellow yelper Madilyn and I headed into the Cheesecake factory tonight with an open mind... Yet I felt my choices were still made poorly. ANYWAYS, I got chicken samosas as my starter - it was actually delicious. Super hot and crispy, well spiced, and the cilantro sauce was an excellent pairing. Reminded me of a good Indian restaurant. Okay so the entree is where I feel I made the wrong decision. I ordered the Cajun jambalaya pasta, which was listed as being ""very spicy"". First off... not spicy at all. So that was disappointing. Also the pasta was definitely overcooked, WAY past al dente and starting to all stick together.. almost mushy. I think there were 4 pieces of small shrimp. It still had an OK flavor - just not what I was expecting for $19. Ended up taking most of it home. OH- I also got a moscow mule and an asian pear martini. The moscow mule didn't even come in a copper mug... I wish I took a picture to show how sad it looked but it wasn't even worthy of one. But I gotta say the pear martini was amazing. I'm still giving 4 stars because of the following reasons - friendly, attentive staff - nice atmosphere - extensive menu - great bread/butter to start - it was actually WARM inside compared to other restaurants i've been to lately. Always a pleasant experience, as I've been here many times before. Will surely be back."
Fox E.,"Buffalo, NY",3669,4868,17339,4.0,3/7/2017,"If it were the Cheapskate Factory then everyone that comes here would be using coupons, groupons, and trying to get stuff for free. Oh wait, that's basically what happens. I'm no fan of corporate chains, and I don't even think TCF's Cheesecake is very good. Their prices are extraordinarily high, their burgers are average, and their shakes are, well, excellent. However, this particular location is something special. It's probably my fave in the country. Not just for the shakes, but also, the employees at this place are incredibly helpful and nice. They really know how to treat customers and have exceptional rapport and customer service, and for that, I will award them a healthy 4."
Lori B.,"Canonsburg, PA",8,179,453,4.0,8/16/2017,"We drove 45 minutes just so We could take advantage of the half price cheesecake!! After an hour wait we got our table. Please reconsider having to ""dine in"" for this offer. It sucks to have to wait so long when you know 75% of the people waiting only came for dessert I'm personally working on trying every flavor they sell!  Went for the banana this time. It was better than I thought. Tasted like a banana cream pie in cheesecake form. No military discount at the Cheesecake Factory, but we will continue to ask anyways!"
Eva R.,"Pittsburgh, PA",291,253,618,3.0,7/20/2017,"Cheesecake factory is always the place to go to when craving some cheesecake. Their menu is extensive and portions are huge. Since it was lunch time, I went with something lighter. I had the Mexican chicken salad. I guess I should not have been surprised that the salad portion was still huge. It had a fried tortilla on the bottom, lots of greens, tomatoes, grilled chicken, tortilla strips, and dressing. I wish there had been more chicken. My friend had the Tuscan chicken dish off the skinnylicious menu and still could not finish her portion. We then of course had to have cheesecake. My favorite is the mango key lime cheesecake, which has a nice coconut crust,key lime cheesecake, mango mousse, and mango glaze. It is creamy, but also very refreshing! A wonderful dessert to have in the summer."
Sareta B.,"Aliquippa, PA",33,99,298,4.0,7/9/2017,"This was my first time visiting a Cheesecake Factory, I actually went to the Apple Store at Ross Park and we decided to stop here for lunch.  When we walked in there was no line and we were seated right away I really liked the Egyptian themed decor it was very calming and ambient.  I ordered the gumbo which was good it had chicken, shrimp, andouille sausage, tomatoes, green peppers, onions, and other spices topped with rice.  Before I left I ordered my desert to go I got the red velvet cheesecake and my daughter got the Oreo chocolate cheesecake.  It was a little pricey for a bowl of gumbo $17.95, $3.00 for a coke, and $7.95 for a slice of cheesecake, but it was good and our waitress was great."
Amy C.,"Pittsburgh, PA",168,430,1429,4.0,4/1/2017,"This Cheesecake factory is always busy!!! There always seems to be a line out the door. The entrance area is always so congested but what is there to say other than, the cheesecake rocks!!! We haven't eaten in since they first opened but we have been here numerous times to get cheesecake to go. The staff at the cheesecake counter is always friendly and fast. Makes it easy to get our cheesecake to go because their cheesecake is awesome!!!"
Andy M.,"Carmel, IN",0,23,,3.0,12/26/2017,Bring your headlamp and a jacket!  This place is dark as a cave and almost as cold.  We actually got our iPhone flashlights out to see our food.  Was seated by the window which was quite breezy.  Food is always good but the atmosphere left little to be desired.
Veronica B.,"Pittsburgh, PA",259,80,113,4.0,2/14/2017,"Pretty decent! I decided to stop in after work and I ordered the Steak Diane. It was definitely grilled to perfection and so tender, but my only hesitation is that it didn't have the exact quality I was looking for. It tasted a bit commercial, and I know it's a commercial chain. However, because of the price, I just still feel it should be a bit more quality in authentic taste.  The other issue is that I ordered it go, and it was almost ice cold when I got home. I don't live far and I didn't make any stops. Because of the temp, I am sure it would have seemed a bit cold to me even if I ate there.  I am not totally counting it, and will go again. Because the Steak DianeThey have a huge menu that can feel a tad bit overwhelming when trying to determine an entrée. But on the flip side, it is GREAT because there are so many options."
Joseph P.,"Altoona, PA",18,21,9,5.0,8/13/2017,"Went here for a late lunch after a day at the zoo!  Amazing portion sizes, great tasting food, and an updated, sizable new menu. I had a hard time choosing what to eat but eventually settled on a chicken piccata dish. It was amazing, the lemon sauce was to die for, and it came with three huge chicken pieces. Finished up with a piece of Godiva chocolate cheesecake. Highly recommended!"
Robert U.,"Pittsburgh, PA",130,696,131,4.0,12/14/2016,"It delivers. Yes, it's part of a big chain, but I don't care.  This place is solid, it's consistent, and it delivers, over and over. Their menu is vast.  I don't like that they don't seem to have a specialty, but they seem to get away with it.  A burrito or taco?  Excellent.  Some Italian food?  They nail it.  A burger and fries?  Solid. And, of course, their huge variety of cheesecakes is part of the fun.  But here's a surprise - their coffee is really quite good (I'm hardcore, and most big restaurants serve crappy coffee). Service, as expected, is consistently very good and efficient.  It's a big huge place, but they make it work.  Expect a colossal wait.  Put your name in and go browse the mall."
Andrea S.,"Pittsburgh, PA",46,75,117,3.0,6/18/2017,"Only giving 3 stars because the waitress was so nice & my mojito was good. I don't come here often but when I do, I usually order the Cajun chicken pasta which has a thick spicy cream sauce, veggies & is topped with tortilla strips that add really nice texture to the dish. (I order it without chicken). The waitress brought it to the table & asked me to stir it & make sure there was no chicken, which I thought was really considerate because a lot of times people forget to not add meat to dishes. It looked fine (We sat outside & it was dark) but after she left I began to eat & the sauce was so thin & there was barely any of it in the pasta, so it was pretty flavorless. I was really disappointed in the execution. It's always been really consistent in the past. I'm sure I'll be back again & will order that dish again, but I'll make sure to ask them to ensure the sauce is creamy, as it should be."
Katie R.,"McKees Rocks, PA",44,37,60,4.0,8/13/2017,The menu is vast! They are not on the no wait app though so be careful during peak times. The cheesecake is always good. I am the biggest fan of their egg roll sampler. Comes with 4 different kinds that are each delicious. I had the shrimp scampi on my most recent trip and my husband had the bang bang shrimp and chicken. Both were very good!
Aaron Z.,"Wexford, PA",133,189,34,3.0,10/6/2016,"I went here on a Friday night with my wife and another couple.  I was expecting there to be a huge wait, but we were pleasantly surprised that it only took us 20 minutes to get a table.  The inside is impressively decorated and the lighting is a bit darker inside.  The menu is a bit overwhelming here.  Too many things to choose from, but in the same breath you can come back frequently and never get the same thing.  Everything on the menu sounded appetizing, and my wife and I settled on two different types of pasta.  Mine was supposed to be a spicier pasta, but it really didn't have much kick to it.  My wife liked hers which had peas, bacon, and Alfredo sauce. It wasn't anything spectacular but they do give you a healthy portion.  The bread that came with the meal was fairly good.  The couple we came split fried chicken and mashed potatoes as well as a salad.  I was a little more envious of their meal than mine.  For dessert, we had the Tuxedo cheesecake in a to go box which for sure exceeded my expectations.   Overall, this is a very expensive place to go eat at.  Our meal was around $60 for 2 dinners and a dessert.  I'm not opposed to come back, but if I'm going to spend $60 for dinner I will go somewhere nicer.  I think the menu does have items that are reasonable and that I would look to get if I end up going here again.  The cheesecake is for sure excellent, so I wouldn't hesitate to stop in to pick up dessert sometime."
Michael Y.,"Alexandria, VA",384,113,205,4.0,5/19/2017,"The world famous Cheesecake Factory. Not much different from the others, which is fine by me since I'm a fan of the place. The food here is what I would call ""splurge"" food---it's really unhealthy and oily---but, if you're at the Cheesecake Factory, that's probably what you're going for anyway. As much as I love eating their super flavored, greasy food, sometimes it's just overpowering and makes me feel a sense of ""ugh"" inside. For example, I got their Jamaican Black Pepper shrimp, and as much as I love eating flavorful things, I thought that the meal was just really heavy for me at the end. Also, the crabcake appetizer I had was really heavy and I didn't know if I even wanted to eat my main entree. Other than the huge dump of calories in my body, I still thoroughly enjoyed my experience here. The decor is Disneyworld-like and really gets you in the mood to have fun. And oh yeah, please try the Cheesecake, it's something that you won't want to miss out on."
Matthew I.,"Pittsburgh, PA",1,26,20,3.0,5/7/2017,Went for brunch. My waffle was undercooked but my guest enjoyed the chop salad.  Service was good but was surprised the inconsistency in food prep.
Valarie J.,"Pittsburgh, PA",229,141,77,3.0,9/5/2016,This is a 3.5 review. The cheesecake of course was amazing and very large. I would absolutely just go to eat the cheesecake. It was well worth the price.  The shrimp scampi that I order was  good but a lot smaller than I expected. My boyfriend has the Cajun pasta and It was more of what I was expecting. The scampi was sort of bland as well.  Other than that this was excellent ! Our server was on point and super nice. I would come back but not get that dish.
Heather H.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,2,,2.0,6/19/2017,"Went on a Monday evening and had a short wait for the table. It was busy. Our waitress was very busy. By the time she came to us we had already had plenty of time to look through the vast menu and decide.  I overheard the couple next to us complaining about the wait for their food and contemplated leaving. Well we should have. It took one hour to get any food. The bread she said she would bring, we had to ask her for 30minutes later as we were starving. Our appetizer came but the main course which were salads took another 20minutes. By that time we were full on apps and bread and had to package them to go.  To top it all off the woman's restrooms were foul!! So a Monday night dinner took 2 hours for a flat read and 2 salads with no meat on them."
Chengchen L.,"Pittsburgh, PA",15,7,37,4.0,9/5/2017,"Food was great, service was a little slow as the place was packed, highly recommend making a reservation even if it is during the week...we went there on a wed night and we had to wait for 20min and then they messed up and some other ppl took our table so we had to wait longer. The waiter was nice, but you can tell he gets irritated when we ask questions since it was so busy and he prob had other things he needs to do...we had the eggroll sampler, the chicken sandwich and pineapple shrimp, and my daughter really liked her bowtie alfredo. All the food was great with generous portions, next time i go i will be sure to make a reservation"
Riley F.,"Virginia Beach, VA",34,2,,2.0,8/1/2017,"I have been to the Cheesecake Factory in Pittsburgh many times and loved it. I came here looking for the same experience, and was quite surprised. We came on a Tuesday evening and we only waited about 5 minutes, which was nice. I ordered the shrimp angel hair, and my boyfriend got the chicken Alfredo. The shrimp was so overcooked that I couldn't eat it. The chicken on his was also very overcooked and the entire dish was flavorless. Very disappointed. If you are going to go here, save your money and go to the Pittsburgh location instead."
Jason R.,"Pittsburgh, PA",20,20,1,5.0,7/26/2017,"I arrived right on time but I didn't make a reservation so it was no problem. I had a gift card but it couldn't be used towards food or drink so I bought a t-shirt. The sizing was a bit off I have to admit. What is usually a medium for me is more like a small at the factory. Biggest complaint would have to be about the sizing. And not a lot of designs. It would be cool if they had one that just said THE FACTORY on the front and on the back it said 'cheesecake, that is' and their hours. Get your shit together."
Evan J.,"Naples, FL",119,8,1,5.0,6/7/2017,"I worked at a fine dining restaurant for years and still think cheescake had us beat. Place is fire, portions are enormous and it actually sucks because its difficult to get more than 1 item. Also make sure you get the mac n cheese balls-incredible. And the adams peanut butter cup fudge ripple is the best cheescake there."
Sharon F.,"Pittsburgh, PA",13,3,10,5.0,1/5/2017,I love the cheesecake so much! Every time after shopping in the mall I'll come to have a piece of cake
Jan M.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,14,,1.0,10/2/2017,first of all they took so long to bring the food out waiter brought my food out cold  and for got about us the whole time  i been here before and the food was great  but  now  seem like it been going down hill  not worth  the money i could of when some where better the money i spent here never again
Karen T.,"Wexford, PA",0,33,,5.0,9/8/2017,"I have had to upgrade my original review.  We have gone back many times and we always love their food.  My husband orders something different every single visit, and he has yet to be disappointed.  I always order the pear flatbread, and I'm still loving it!  There is nothing lacking."
Anna C.,"Pittsburgh, PA",18,13,15,3.0,4/5/2016,"First off, this branch is always, always full which is why the wait is always long. I would have given this place another star if it weren't for the long wait all the time. After waiting for 25 minutes, our party of 2 was seated... quite close to other tables that seated 2 people. It would be nice to have more space. They definitely need to make room for the volume of costumers they get.  But anyway, I ordered a Veggie Melt sandwich. It doesn't sound exciting but it was de-licious! I didn't even miss meat while I was stuffing my face, which I think is a sign of a good veggie dish. I also had the Salted Caramel Cheesecake which of course was good but a little too sweet for me. The service was great, no complaints here. Our server in particular was attentive and quick.  All in all, a good experience but a word of warning: you will be likely to over eat given the HUGE portions."
Lauren G.,"Pittsburgh, PA",3,14,8,3.0,1/31/2017,"I like their food and atmosphere but sometimes its too crowned and long line waiting,I always wanna try the desert but always ended up too full next time im going to leave some room for desert:)"
Kathryn F.,"Pittsburgh, PA",2,102,20,4.0,8/24/2015,First .... have a house salad ... all kinds of spring greens.  It is one of the best salads I have ever eaten. Second ... order the filet ... tell them not to butterfly it ... have the waitress repeat back to you ... do not butterfly  Sit back and enjoy ... you will be give a cleaver to cut your steak ... a butter knife will do. I won't even begin to describe the desserts.   Wear loose pants ... you not going to want to waste a single bite.
Catherine G.,"Mars, PA",90,55,373,5.0,4/28/2016,"Love this place.  The menu is amazing...anything and everything is on the menu.  I got the skinny salad....which was amazing.  I think it was only 240 calories.  Tasted like 1240 calories... We did not get any cheesecake, but I do recommend it if you eat here."
Joey M.,"Coraopolis, PA",0,2,,1.0,2/6/2017,I was disappointed on this visit.  They brought a completely burnt piece of miso salmon to our table. I flagged down a manager because our server was no where to be found and he had it remade but this time it was actually raw inside.  How can this dish that we have enjoyed at least twenty times over the last two years suddenly be so messed up twice in one day?
Jayson M.,"Hawthorne, CA",392,90,82,4.0,5/26/2016,"Thanks Colin for the lunch service! I got the Rene's special with the small Caesar salad, onion soup, and the Chicken Sandwich which was just enough to fill me up. The Calamari was too salty for me.  The stuff mushrooms were bomb though!"
Arlene M.,"Pittsburgh, PA",354,768,3120,3.0,7/21/2014,My city has two Cheesecake factory restaurants. I have eaten at both and they are identical. My first recommendation is to get there when it opens otherwise you will be waiting quite some time for a seat. Normally when I eat there I go for lunch since they serve huge portions. I normally order a lunch salad and it is so huge I really can't eat much more of anything else. They do serve two kinds of bread with your meal. My favorite is the brown bread with white seeds on top. They do have various cheesecakes in a cooler case when you enter so you can see the various types. You can also purchase them for takeout. They are very filling but the are NY style. Believe me it isn't authentic but the next best thing to it. I usually end up taking food home since they serve large portions. Keep in mind this is a chain restaurant and you can find it in various cities.
Jean G.,"Verona, PA",46,81,2,3.0,4/21/2016,"We went here for lunch recently, and despite the steep prices, I wanted to try the place. I've never had their food and everyone raves about it.  The menu was so long and almost daunting. I ended up going with my safety and ordering the Pit Dip, which was alright, but nothing special. A little too sticky and there were odd bits of lettuce in the cheese (when the sandwich does not contain lettuce). Wasn't a fan. The fries were OK, but considering I paid $15 for my lunch, I expected something a little better.  I'm not sure if the massive menu is just their thing or not, but it made things harder than they needed to be for decent quality food that definitely wasn't worth the money."
Guy J.,"McKees Rocks, PA",2,1,,2.0,12/30/2016,"I had the chicken teriyaki, the chicken came out raw in the middle. After the waiter had it reheated the underside was completely burnt. I paid $76 for us to eat lunch and I had to stop at Wendy's to eat. We will not be returning."
Gary F.,"Forest Hills, PA",0,10,,1.0,3/8/2017,We've eaten at other Cheesecake Factory s. Including this one. I've never experienced a messed up experience as tonight.  Waited over an hour for a pork chop dinner. Waitress was really struggling. It seemed like all her tables were having problems.  Her attention span was very limited.  They need to retrain her.  It looks like she got the cooks mad at her
