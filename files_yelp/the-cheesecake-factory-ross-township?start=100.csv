Jameson J.,"Erie, PA",14,175,115,3.0,2/25/2013,"Dynamite shrimp was pretty good. Spinach artichoke dip was decent. Overall, it's simply the Cheesecake Factory. You're not going there for A+ authentic food. You're going there because you're at the mall and hungry and this restaurant has literally the largest menu I've ever seen."
T B.,"Glenshaw, PA",0,19,,3.0,11/15/2014,"My brother in law visiting from out of town took me, my wife, and daughter to Cheesecake factory @ Ross Park.  I had ahi tuna tataki salad, it was good but a little on the sweet side. my wife had a chicken salad and enjoyed it. my daughter had  a pasta dish and equally enjoyed it. my brother in law had sheapards pie, also good. The service was fantastic, after we moved table from the loudest place next to the kitchen with loud clanging dishes etc. The atmosphere was incredibly dark to the point all of us had trouble reading the menu and seeing what we were eating. All in all it was just OK, but very overpriced for the quality of food. Overrated."
Kim M.,"Pittsburgh, PA",6,129,,2.0,11/3/2012,"I wanted to go for Thai but my dining partner wanted cheese cake and we both wanted to eat outside.  The service was all you could wish for, the atmosphere is chain, the cheese cake looked good. I chose a healthy chopped vegetable salad that was meh, fine. I can't even find descriptive words for it. It was as if on a lazy day I cleaned out the fridge of bits and ends of cooked and raw veggies. Mostly lettuce, huge bowl, couple chunks of asparagus, unexceptional dressing, a couple pieces of beet, a handful of good cheddar chunks on the top for $10 without chicken.   For $12 I could have gone to Mad Mex and had a similarly large salad with lots of grilled chicken and a spicy sauce, for $7.50 I could have had a homemade Thai soup with drunken noodles at Red Orchid. I will never willingly go here again."
Robert E.,"Canfield, OH",0,6,,4.0,10/23/2014,Food was delicious. Prices are managable. Cheese cake is out of this world! Only have to take a star off because it gets loud in the restaurant and alcoholic drinks are too pricey for what you get.
Ashlynn R.,"Pittsburgh, PA",201,122,6,4.0,11/26/2011,"I would eat here once a week! I've never had to wait to be seated here, but I've never gone to the place on a busy night or even a weekend. I've always gone here on a week day for lunch. There was also a lot of parking near the restaurant too. Everything I've ever tried from The Cheesecake Factory has been delicious - pizza, soup, sandwiches, pastas, salads, appetizers and so on. For your appetizer, you must try the buffalo blasts! They're yummy little deep fried wontons filled with chicken and hot sauce and I think cheese. Then you get little bowls of more hot sauce and bleu cheese. (Seriously thinking about dragging the boyfriend out there for lunch today as I type this...) Their menu, ah their menu. It's such a beautiful place so the ads in their menus always get me. BUT if it's to keep their prices the way they are, I'm all for them. Seriously - a girlfriend and I ordered a lunch sized portion of their BBQ chicken salad for around $11 and there was enough to feed four of us! I'm not complaining though, I love their portion sizes because I love having left overs. Then the cheesecake, ohhh the cheesecake. You have to have it! It runs around $8 a slice but its soooo worth it! I love the vanilla bean, the Reese's peanut butter kind and this past summer they had a pina colada cheesecake. All were divine! The one thing this location in particular lacks is decent service. Every time I've visited our waitress was awful.  One visit in particular went like this: Drinks weren't kept full - we were seated outside in 80+ degree weather, I was 9 months pregnant and drinking water like a fish and the girl refilled our drinks maybe twice and both times with water warm enough to bathe in. She rarely checked on us and when she did and we needed something, she was soooooo slow to return. We needed boxes to take all of our leftovers home in (seriously a ton - buffalo blasts, 3/4 of a pizza, our bread and half of a salad) and she brought us two tiny boxes. Umm, just all of the salad we had fit in those two boxes, she should have been smarter than that. She never offered us dessert, we had to ask. Then it took another year to get it. Then she let us sit there, minus drinks with all of our food packed up, dessert finished, until we flagged her down to get our check. Ridiculous. Did I mention that I was 9 mo pregnant sitting out in that heat minus enough cool water for over two hours because of a crappy waitress? I'm still upset about that and tempted to write the manager. She didn't get a tip. Typically, when I experience crappy service like that, I never go back and I tell every single person I know. BUT the food is that good that you should go back. Again, we had that much left over and we only paid around $30 for it all. It fed my boyfriend and I for the next two days! If I ever get treated like that by a waitress there again, I will have no problem asking for a manager right then and there and telling him what's up. Oh, and another weird thing. I hate all of the door handles in that place. They're just plain awkward."
Mary H.,"Valencia, PA",2,25,2,2.0,4/20/2014,"This was my first visit to the Cheesecake Factory. I was enjoying a birthday celebration with my sister. Our birthdays are days apart. She suggested this establishment. I do not like cheesecake but we gave it a try for lunch. We waited a bit long to be seated. The cake display was nice. The seating arrangement is tight. To close to the stranger next to ya. I ordered shrimp scampi. This is my favorite dish. I was so disappointed . My shrimp was rubbery and bland. The plating was sad. There was 5 medium sized shrimp around a pile of dry tasteless pasta. Seriously! For almost $20.00 you need to receive a really fantastic lunch. It was our birthday celebration so I did not mention this to our party of 4. If I would of been with my husband or my son I would of ask to see the chef. The look of the place and staff has that going for it but the food sucks.Our waiter was super nice and easy on the eyes. If the reputation your going for is a respectful, pleasantly clean higher end restaurant you need to follow through with a chef that cares about how his food taste and looks. Yes you go to your favorite place because of the staff I get that but the food is the whole reason from the start."
Matt L.,"Mountain View, CA",4,107,12,3.0,5/24/2012,"The avocado egg rolls were a surprisingly good. They're not cheap at nearly $10 for 6 halves, but I would actually consider ordering them again for sharing despite their price. Other portions were pretty generous but prices are a little high."
Ian L.,"Wexford, PA",38,29,13,4.0,8/9/2010,"Delicious cheesecake as always. Food is what you'd expect from the chain. It has a large variety to chose from and it definitely takes a few minutes to look through all of their choices. We ordered the nachos as an appetizers and was a lot more than the 2 of us imagined, (I'm 6'3"" so I'm not some small guy), but we managed to eat what 3-4 people could enjoy.  We ended up taking our cheesecake home for later because of how full we were so its always a treat to have something to look forward to."
Jim M.,"Pittsburgh, PA",6,52,3,2.0,9/3/2013,Food was just okay. The shrimp was overdone and not the proper size for a entree dish. The server Patrick B. was one of the worse servers I had in a very long time.   Had no people skills and did not know the menu.
Marlene C.,"Fairmont, WV",44,22,2,4.0,9/13/2010,"I was here for a birthday and let me tell you...the food is really good, our waitress was great (she handled our party of 9 great), and the cheesecake is absolutely wonderful!! I thought it was a bit pricey, but nothing too outrageous.  I'm used to sides coming with the dinners and not paying a la carte for them.  The floor is a bit slick so please watch while walking.  I don't know how the waiters and waitresses didn't slip.  Great food and great fun."
Shanna C.,"Pittsburgh, PA",33,72,11,4.0,11/5/2008,"There's nothing new to be said about The Cheesecake Factory itself - yes it's a big expensive chain (with advertising on every page of their menu). Granted. Since Ross Park Mall is now revitalized with upscale stores, you're limited to the Cheesecake Factory for upscale eating (who wants to shop at Tiffany's and then go to a crowded foodcourt?), aside from the crowded cafes at Nordstroms. During peak shopping times (Anytime on Weekends) be aware of the very long wait ahead of you - an hour, probably. It's going to be busy. However, the vibrating reservation gadgets work all over the mall, so if you're in for a day of light ""do-as-you-please"" shopping or you're only there for one stop it may be a good idea for you to grab a reservation before you start out into the mall. Cheesecake Factories are probably the same expensive, yet delicious, food all over the country. You get what you pay for - especially in the case of the Ahi Carpaccio. It MAY (a HUGE may) rival Nobu for the special place in my heart reserved for raw tuna.  I'm generally unimpressed by their very large salads and pasta dishes. The real stars at The Cheesecake Factory are the appetizers and the cheesecakes themselves. You can never go wrong with the cheesecake varieties. The slices are pretty big, and you may be stuffed from all the food, so it's good to know that they can very neatly split one slice up for two people. A word on the beers: currently they have Blue Moon, Yuengling, and... I'm blanking on the last one. (It's not Guinness, and that's all I care about.) They have many different bottles, in addition to pricey cocktails and wine."
Tricia S.,"Pittsburgh, PA",86,38,,3.0,12/2/2007,"Although they have the same large (!) menu, service, prices and general decor as the rest of the chain - I was disappointed as the dining area feels more like a cafeteria with their rows of small tables (due to their limited space).  It's a little out of the way, so if I weren't at the mall already I probably wouldn't battle traffic to venture up to the hill top mall area just to dine here. That said, mall parking is free and if you're shopping there anyway (especially during the holidays), it's nice not to have to pack up the car and relocate once you are finally done or need to refuel before getting another fix of your shop-till-you-drop addiction. The curbside-to-go service makes this a nice addition to the North Hills shopping experience, so you might want to jot down their number and pocket a to-go menu (or visit their website) and call in an order before heading home."
Michael S.,"Pittsburgh, PA",1,9,,4.0,10/13/2011,"can't get passed the dessert list on the menu. their cheesecake is out of this world good! i always leave with a ""doggy bag"" and end up having to bring my cheesecake home to eat hours later because of how full i get from appetizers and the main dish. great place to eat."
Rachael B.,"Valencia, PA",7,23,,4.0,3/1/2012,"Great experience, service was very attentive and on top of their game. We had a table of eight and they still managed to keep everyone's drinks filled and the bread basket full. We ordered the artichoke dip as an appetizer; a bit on the disappointing side. The chips were nice and crispy, but a little over-salted. I went with something I knew was good there...the Herb Encrusted Salmon with Asparagus and Mashed Potatoes (ha I write it like it's a move title). Anyways, it never fails to disappoint! They cooked the salmon medium rare (the way it SHOULD be cooked!) and the lemon butter sauce gave a nice sour edge to the entire meal. The decor is nice and laid back, although the lighting gets to be a bit too dim by the end of the night, at least in our section. Sometimes I feel like they crowd their menu a bit too much thus serving a lot of so-so dishes. They could benefit from a good spring cleaning of the menu :)"
Cindy E.,"CRANBERRY TWP, PA",23,2,,1.0,9/4/2011,"OVERRATED!!!  Food was average.  Service was horrible!!!  It took 45 minutes to get our food and waited 20 minutes for our waiter to come back to take our dessert order.  By time he came back the kids were too tired and didn't even want to stay.  It shouldn't take 2 hours for dinner.  Plus, the kids were charged for drinks which should have been included in the kids meal.  Asked the manager to correct the issue and was charged twice.  We will never go back."
Patrick B.,"Allison Park, PA",0,17,,3.0,8/29/2011,"This is a decent, affordable restaurant.  Every time I visit I have try the passion iced tea and one of the small plate appetizers that range from $4 - $6. they are the perfect portion and price. The restaurant could be better, though.  Having to wait for a table, and then wait another 10 -15 minutes next to the hostess podium to be sat is odd.  The portions are friggin huge, and while they dont charge a fee to share entrees, the chefs will not split the entrees for you, the way they will at Bravo.  The server will hand you another plate and a serving spoon - there ya go, have at it! Charging $7 - $9 for a piece of cheesecake is robbery given that the cheesecake is just defrosted from a cardboard box.  The atmosphere is ugly and outdated, and I always look up to wonder if one of those cone-shaped fixtures is about to fall and impale me.  The service staff is very friendly and knowledgeable, and you can definitely find something on the menu to rave about."
Linda R.,"Pittsburgh, PA",1,5,,4.0,3/2/2008,"The factory was over-crowded Saturday night. For two of us, there was about a 90 minute wait. Good thing Ross Park Mall is next door which gave us plenty to do while we waited. I ordered the Hibachi Steak which was fantastic. The service was very good even though we were a little disappointed to be seated in a little corner in the bar area. Even though the place was mobbed, we could still have a nice conversation. I would go back again, but not on a Saturday night."
