Vonne J.,"Pittsburgh, PA",19,11,,5.0,10/21/2016,Always a winner!  I wish everyone would quit complaining about the large portions. It's their thing!!!!!  OMG take the rest home or share!
Julie D.,"Wilmington, NC",380,1200,1382,4.0,8/30/2014,"It's taken me forever and a few years to write a review for The Cheesecake Factory at Ross Park Mall.  I guess it's because I don't really understand the love and the appeal.  This place is almost always packed!!  I also don't really understand how they can have such a large menu that covers almost every type of food there is and get everything right.  And that's because they don't.  Even so, the masses flock to this place like bees to a hive. It should be the ultimate place to dine while at the mall!  Beautiful interior, soaring ceilings, custom painted fancy columns, dark wood booths.  Service is friendly and generally spot on.   Back to the menu (complete with advertisements, am I the only one that finds this so tacky?), you can get pizza, pasta,(including jambalaya style) seafood, steaks and chops, salads, sandwiches, burgers, omelets and Sunday Brunch.  For beverages, they serve wine, beer, cocktails, frozen drinks, espresso, milkshakes.  Again, you want it, they got it.   Quantities can sometimes be too large.  I got a salad here one time that was so big it was almost embarrassing.  I could not longer see my date over my salad.  It was more greens that I could eat in one week.  Oh, and the cheesecake.  The choices here are also over the top and decedent.  But really, who has room left for dessert?  Of course, they are more than happy to bag it up for you to take out. A recent addition that is making me like them more is The SkinnyLicious Menu.  Again, an overkill with all the choices.  And you will never get skinny eating these meals, but it is a vast improvement over their regular fare."
Tyoko B.,"Pittsburgh, PA",145,267,791,3.0,9/6/2015,"My first visit at a Cheesecake Factory was somewhere near Gaithersburg, MD years ago. I thought is was the best thing since texas toast so when they started cropping up here, I was excited. Stopped by for dinner the other night and just wasn't impressed. Our waitress was extremely nice but the food...just meh. What happened? Maybe it's the steak and shrimp combo I ordered? Maybe I just do cheesecake next time?  I'll give them another try in a few months and update my review."
Stephanie P.,"Gibsonia, PA",0,5,,1.0,3/24/2017,"Hi,  I felt I had to share my experience with you since I will never eat at your establishment again during to the poor management staff you have at your ross park mall location. On Monday afternoon my lunch guest and I ordered Renee's special. Nothing too complicated, right? We waited thirty five minutes for our meal and this entire time we never saw our waiter. He never filled our ice teas   or water or checked on us to pretend he even cared. To really top this lunch trip off when we finally got our meal, our French onion soup was ice cold. Again, we didn't see our waiter until we were almost done with our meal, sans the soup. We told him our disappointment with the soup and wait time and he sent over a manager. The manager told us that HE forgot to turn the soup warmer on and offered to warm up our soup. THAT'S IT! After waiting for thirty five minutes you want me to wait while you warm up my soap? I have never experienced such horrible customer in my life. I hope this will serve you on how to better train your management staff since they obviously need a lot of work."
Kimberly K.,"Baltimore, MD",251,143,70,4.0,8/9/2014,"I'm mad relieved that I decided to give this location another shot.  I came here for a late lunch the other day with my mom, and the food was seriously legit.  We got two dishes and split them because that's how we do!  We ordered the Herb-crusted Salmon (with asparagus and seasoned green beans) and the Louisiana Chicken Pasta.   Both were delicious.  The salmon was perfectly cooked, and the accompanying sauce was ri-DIC-ulous. The green beans were slightly salty but the asparagus was on point!  The pasta was effin' yummy.  The coating on the chicken was thin and crispy, and the pasta was al dente (hell yes!).   As always, portions were HUGE - def. enough for a second lunch, ha!  Oh, and the bread here was really good!  It came out totally fresh - warm bread FTW.  Our waitress was really nice and attentive.  I'll DEFINITELY be back again. FYI:  it gets crazy busy here so there's usually a wait.  Just a heads up in case any of ya'll are in a rush!"
Nicole P.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,1,,1.0,11/27/2016,"Just was snapped at by the hostess for asking why I couldn't get a buzzer while waiting for a table. Wanted to browse at LL Bean. Was told very testily it was because they ""weren't on a long wait!!!"". Didn't appreciate the attitude. Was also told they do not send texts. So basically, ""Too bad, stand in line."". What kind of customer service is that??"
Michele P.,"Pittsburgh, PA",18,33,70,4.0,6/28/2014,Pleasantly surprised to only wait 25 minutes for a table for 4 on a Saturday night!  They give you a beeper thing while you're wanting so you can always wait outside or shop in LLBean next door. This restaurant had the largest menu I've ever seen.  Our server Liz was great. The food was delicious.  Love the honey wheat bread with the oats! She stayed ahead of our drink refills which made me happy. The hibachi steak melts in your mouth.  The shrimp bacon club sandwich was the size of my husband's head.  The booths are also amazing because theyre technically for 6 so a family of 4 has plenty of room!  Every Cheesecake factory o's the same and predictably great.
Angie W.,"Bridgeport, WV",31,108,116,5.0,3/14/2016,"I love the food...love the cheesecake even more, but I hate the wait and the crowded seating.  I can't believe that they don't use No Wait.  The two hour wait and pagers that don't work outside of the doors make for an overly crowded lobby and miserable customers.  This trip I got the chicken tortillas.  My favorite part of this dish is the corn cakes.  They are so good.  The dish is a little bit spicy (but I'm kind of a wimp when it comes to heat).  I also had the Salted Caramel Cheesecake.  I am a huge salted caramel fan, but this cheesecake was so disappointing!  There's so much caramel it's overwhelming.  There are no other flavor dimensions.  It's probably the worst cheesecake I've had from there.  All the complaints aside, I love this place.  It's a special treat."
Stephen B.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,8,,2.0,12/13/2016,"This is a 2 star only because my wife's meal was edible and the manager took care of my meal issues.  We went to lunch expecting a nice meal.  We have been to this location at least 30 times over the years and have had good meals.  Today not the case.  Start with the edible meal.  My wife ordered chicken tortilla soup and turkey sandwich with small salad.   The bowl of CHICKEN tortilla soup had 2, maybe 3 pieces of actual chicken in it.  Hardly any tortilla in the soup, but it had flavor and was spicy.  We were given white sourdough bread, but expected the good dark sweet bread that we have received every other time here.  For some reason we didn't get the bread we liked but the tables next to us got it?   Her sandwich was okay, nothing to brag about.  I ordered a dinner portion Cobb salad.  I have ordered this before and really enjoyed it.  This time it came out looking sad.  I noticed a literal ball shape of chicken on the right side of the salad.  Upon inspecting it and peeling apart the chicken layers, it was nasty.  It showed many signs of being undercooked, was a bit slippery, and was fatty.  It was also stone cold.  It looked like someone reached into an old tray of chicken and grabbed a ball of old chicken and set it on my salad.  The kitchen staff obviously did not inspect the chicken.  The rest of the salad was not too good.  Hardly any egg around the edge like I normally get.  Barely any dressing in the salad and not much bacon.  It was basically chopped lettuce.   I showed the waitress the chicken and her face showed it all.  She showed the manager and he came over and apologized and agreed that the chicken looked bad.  He did not charge me for the salad.  I was offered replacement food as well but did not feel like eating anything else there at the time.   The salad was $15.  I hope they have not changed their salads since the last time I had a good one there.   It definitely was not worth $15 even with a good piece of chicken.   Overall, a nice day off with my wife and the lunch was a huge disappointment.  I probably won't go back to this restaurant for a while.  The staff were nice and I left a 15% tip based on the full meal price before the comped salad.  Not the waitress fault that the kitchen was inept today in performing their job."
Lisa M.,"Pittsburgh, PA",43,17,5,5.0,6/22/2016,Great food and great customer service. Everything was hot and fresh. The only downfall is the hard yard chairs that you got to sit on.
Jackie N.,"Pittsburgh, PA",5,5,,1.0,4/28/2017,"First we went out because it was my mother in law's birthday and my husband's. Absolutely HORRIBLE hostesses. Just a bit of advice... if you want to talk about a customer wait until they can't hear you or read your lips. They were rude. I called ahead asking if it would be busy, they said it shouldn't a problem. When we arrived they said it would take 2 hours for a table. My father in law went in no more than 15 minutes later and asked for Why two tables were empty and if we could just sit there. The hostesses rudely said yes and we were able to seat IMMEDIATELY. We sat down at the table around 6:45 and ordered the food around 6:50. My son got his food at 7:40 and IT WAS AFTER I had asked for it to be brought out as soon as possible. It was corn dogs and fries. There were several tables that sat before us and were served. We did not receive our food until 8:00. The food was cold and the salmon had MULTIPLE bones in it. One of our guests had to LEAVE without even being able to sit and eat because we had waited so long. She had to ask for it to be boxed. The manager didn't even say a word about it. The manager didn't even act like she cared and she looked disheveled. The standards at this restaurant are equivalent to a fast food restaurant, but with colder food. I will continue to tell everyone and anyone not to visit this location if they ever want to be satisfied. A waste of $110, while no one at the party got to eat a good and warm meal. We were disgusted."
Carl G.,"New Kensington, PA",0,4,2,3.0,11/23/2016,"If you go on a weekend expect a very long 1and a half to a 2 hour wait.  Friend wanted to go here so just drank couple drinks at bar while waited. Food very good, I had chicken Romano which was good. Buddy had salmon dish that she loved. Wifey had a Hawaiian salad which she said was very good .  Of course deserts"
Jim W.,"Pittsburgh, PA",327,98,56,3.0,12/6/2013,"We (wife and I) come here a few times a year.  We typically enjoy the food and are shell-shocked by the drink prices.   The good: +The menu is ginormous.  There's something for everyone.  We almost always get the spicy ahi tempura roll.  Love it. +The food is good.  It's not great, but it's good.   +The atmosphere.  It's nicely decorated...fancy feeling. The bad: -It's very popular.  LOTS of people here at all hours.  It is not surprising to have wait times 1-2 hours on any day of the week at any hour of the evening. -The drinks cost a small fortune.  My wife and I waited two hours for a table one night and thought...""why don't we just have a couple drinks while we wait?""  We did.  We paid our bar tab and then bought dinner and wine.  When we paid for the meal it cost less than the bar bill had for two drinks each. Best way to enjoy the Cheesecake Factory is go an hour or so before you really want to eat and get on the waiting list.  Take a buzzer with you into the mall, shop for a while and then check back.  Otherwise, the wait is too long.  Plan ahead, and it's a nice evening meal."
Grandin H.,"Sacramento, CA",1,37,,2.0,4/13/2016,"I know exactly what to expect from Cheesecake Factory restaurants. The food is always consistent, they have plenty of choices (maybe even too many), and the cheesecake is rich and delicious. I've been here a few times during off-peak hours and there is sometimes still a wait. The wait on weekends just isn't worth it.  The food is rich. Everything is rich. Sauces, toppings, cheese... and if those weren't heavy enough, they bring warm endless baskets of bread with butter. Hmmm, can anyone really leave without dessert? OK, it's delicious. Yes, it's delicious. But, this isn't the place you want to eat three times a week, or you'll soon be buying a new wardrobe. (Check out their calorie counts for each menu item--some entrees have a whole day's worth of calories--and that's before you add on appetizers, bread, and, of course, the cheesecake!) Enough of that...  The menu is about a half inch thick with lots of variety. It's a 'something-for-everyone' place that offers seafood, meat, poultry, and pasta. Most of the entrees are pasta-based meals in very generous portions. We usually leave with plenty of leftovers to make another meal.  Every Cheesecake Factoy I've ever visited has the exact same menu, the exact same portions, and the exact same decor. Once inside, you can't tell if you're in a Cheesecake Factory in Florida, or a Cheesecake Factory in Pennsylvania, or a Cheesecake Factory in Moscow (if there are any in Moscow!) There is a reason they call this place a 'Factory.' It's like going into an expensive McDonald's--you know exactly what to expect, both good and bad. The decor is 'Bellagio' meets 'Disney World.'  The interior of this place (like all other Cheesecake Factories) is someone's idea of ancient Rome (I think). It looks like the interior of most houses on that old TV show ""Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous' proving that there is no correlation between wealth and good taste.  As everyone else comments, the wait is long--sometimes painfully long--and the seating is often cramped. They don't accept reservations, and the range of the pagers is not too far from the front entrance. The hostess will give you a fairly accurate estimation of how long your wait will be, so you're probably safe taking a walk around the mall and returning reasonably often to ask, 'How much longer....?' That's IF you really want to eat here. When I do go here, I usually plan on a late lunch/early dinner (3PM) or visit on weekday evenings. I have to admit, I started this review with 5 stars, and as I wrote all the negatives, I kept whittling away at stars, until I ended up giving them 2. If you're in the mood for heavy, rich, 'comfort' food, by all means splurge (both calories and $$$) and eat here. I usually go here when friends suggest it. There are other many other good restaurants within a mile or two."
Kira S.,"Pittsburgh, PA",2,17,15,3.0,6/13/2014,"I have been here several times and it is always because it is just a convenient option. As far as chain restaurants go, it is fine. The decor is always awful and quite frankly I have no idea what it has to do with cheesecake. I also wonder why they make their servers dress in white. It seems like a bad idea because they will always look dirty. You just can't keep white clean in a restaurant. I think they want you to feel like you're in heaven but if so, it must be the dodgy part.  The food is decent but I find their portions to be way too large creating inflated prides. Also, their menu is so large it seems impossible for them to make anything amazing food-wise. I do like their cheesecake but I question the amount of unnecessary ingredients they use.  We ordered the white bean chicken chili from the Skinny menu (because we wanted normal portions). And we also shared the kabob appetizer. Both were among the most enjoyable things I've gotten there. The chili was very good and a bit spicy. The kabob could have been better but I wasn't expecting authentic kabob taste. The meat was the disappointing part. The yogurt sauce was good though.    Our waitress last nice gave us an extra 25 minutes to decide on dessert since we weren't ready the first time. I'm not sure where she went but we didn't even see her to flag down in that time period.  Overall this place is fine in a pinch but it will never be among my favorites."
Cameron H.,"Indiana, PA",1,8,,3.0,11/11/2016,"Foods always good. Service BLOWS. I've yet to have a competent waiter. But the cheesecake is bomb, of course."
Dion S.,"Pittsburgh, PA",145,16,,4.0,7/4/2015,"It's one of those places where you'll say 'this will do' Food is great everytime, service is touch and go. However, Being from New Zealand I HAVE to remember that American serving sizes are insane. So make sure you have a lot of room in your stomach."
Stacie C.,"Pittsburgh, PA",146,536,1314,4.0,2/27/2012,"My friend and I arrived early on a Sunday for brunch.  Our server William was very helpful and friendly.  He went over the menu and asked if we had any questions as I had never been there before.  I told him it really wasn't necessary because even though I hadn't been there before, I was far from unprepared.  He then went on to tell is, ""It's going to be a good day"" and how he picks one day every three weeks or so and decides it's going to be his birthday.  I like the way he thinks. It felt like MY birthday when my Morning Quesadilla arrived.  There were so many goodies in there, I couldn't believe it.  And goodies on the side, too - heaping piles of salsa, sour cream and guacamole.  So delicious.  I highly recommend.  I also ordered the Lemon-Ricotta Pancakes because I've heard such good things about them.  They tasted almost as good as they smelled which was heavenly.  But after my quesadilla I was only able to eat a portion of the pancakes, even when assisted by my friend.  I took home the leftovers and they were still delicious the next day. I also ordered a piece of Godiva cheesecake to go.  I don't think I've ever been disappointed by a piece of their cheesecake and this was some chocolatey goodness. The place was hopping when we left, so I would recommend getting there early (i.e. when they open) to enjoy the brunch menu."
Bryan T.,"Mars, PA",0,6,1,5.0,8/9/2015,"Everything about our visit to the Cheesecake Factory today was great. We had a very good waiter, Zach, who was always on the ball and very friendly. Management should give him a raise! I ordered the Grilled Chicken Tostada salad. First of all, it looked beautiful. And it also tasted wonderful! One of the best salads I've had in a long time. The atmosphere was great as well, except for the crazy kids that were sitting in the table behind us. All in all, it was a wonderful Sunday afternoon at the Cheesecake Factory."
Allison M.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,24,,5.0,3/26/2016,"The food is always good, fresh, and cooked to order! We love this place! The staff is always friendly! A ton of complaints about the wait, but that's part of the character of this restaurant. If you want to eat here during a busy time (weekends, some evenings) you're going to have to wait. There's no way around it. There's no call ahead, there's no app to get a better place in line, there's no giving a cell phone number and getting a text when your table is ready. If you want to eat here you have to wait the old fashioned way.   That being said, if the wait is over an hour we will often go to the mall for a little bit, but beware your pager doesn't reach past the front doors and if you miss your page you lose your spot in line!"
