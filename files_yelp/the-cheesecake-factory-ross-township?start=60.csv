Elizabeth B.,"Pittsburgh, PA",187,744,192,4.0,7/18/2014,"The best part of this Cheesecake Factory is its proximity to Ross Park Mall! When you're tired and hungry after a long afternoon of shopping, this is the perfect place to come. I actually love to get cheesecake to-go from here. Looking at the cases of cheesecakes always gets me salivating. Plus, when you take it home, you can snack on it for a day or two instead of just feeling very full all at once. I highly recommend getting an after-shopping snack from here!"
M C.,"Cleveland, OH",1,80,4,5.0,12/13/2015,"Somewhat surprisingly, the bathrooms were dirty, but that was probably just due to a lazy janitor.  Other than that, the place is great.  The food is really good, better than other Cheesecake Factories in my opinion.  The lunch deals before 5 PM are a particularly good value."
Jamie G.,"Cranberry Township, PA",0,52,16,3.0,11/14/2015,"Just ok, we waited two hours to be seated. If the Cheesecake Factory wasn't attached to the mall, we wouldn't have waited that long. After being seated, we were greeted promptly by our server. She brought our drinks and bread quickly. I ordered the bang bang chicken and shrimp. My husband got the jambalaya. The bang bang shrimp and chicken was ok. The shrimp was small and there was more rice than meat. My husbands dish was good and full of flavor. The draft beer list really needs updated with more IPA's. We had the salted caramel cheesecake, it was good, but the middle was rather cold. It seemed as though it wasn't completely defrosted."
Carly W.,"Gibsonia, PA",0,9,1,3.0,12/16/2015,"We visited this past Monday and sat at a big round table around 4:30 in the afternoon. The restaurant was not very crowded. The service was mediocre at best. The waitress forgot my salad and the burger that came to our table wasn't cooked how we ordered it. Took forever to re cook it. I always viewed the Cheesecake Factory as a nice place to go for a date or special occasion, but the past few times I've gone the staff has just been so ""blah"" that it doesn't even feel special when we go."
Lin X.,"Redwood City, CA",19,57,41,4.0,5/13/2014,"Since we came here on a Wednesday, it wasn't crowded at all. I haven't been to Cheesecake factory for a while, so I don't remember their big menu and huge portions though I know I always have leftovers to take home. It took us some time to go through the menu and decided what to order. My friend had Bistro Shrimp Pasta and I got the Barbeque Ranch Chicken Salad. We were shocked when we got the food. It was a lot. We both like our dishes. It was good to eat a big salad. As for cheesecake, we had Reese's® Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake Cheesecake. It wasn't bad, but a little bit too sweet for me. Not much cheesecake in it either."
Sandy G.,"Rochester, PA",4,34,3,5.0,7/29/2015,"Great service great food!  We went on national cheesecake day. I took my three young nephews. The server couldn't be nicer to them. I had the chicken Parmesan sandwich and the boys had pizza and wings. They love their meal and so did I! We also had the buffalo chicken meat balls for the appetizer. Delicious. I have nothing negative to say about this place. Oh and almost forgot the best part, the cheesecake! Amazing. Hershey's chocolate yum!!"
Danielle P.,"Washington, PA",204,315,69,4.0,6/3/2015,"The Cheesecake Factory has upped the ante with their new lighter fare menu. I was pleased to be able to have a healthier meal here that was also free of my food allergens. The waitress was very knowledgeable of the menu and made sure the chef knew my allergies prior to preparing my meal. This is seldom the case in large chain restaurants with huge menus! I was very pleasantly surprised. As for the food, my husband got the Steak Diane and Shrimp Scampi combo. This was an oversized plate that they are known for, but he said it was excellent. I opted for the Turkey Avocado sandwich and a side salad. It sounds so simple but it was delicious! I was also very pleased with their fun presentation since I didn't get a bun. They made it a nice sandwich stack! I will definitely be heading back for a bite when I'm at the mall again!"
Rebecca K.,"Pittsburgh, PA",27,110,79,4.0,3/8/2014,"Pleasantly surprised! I thought this was not going to be good- how can a restaurant with a 20+ menu possibly be good. 4 of us wanted about 30 minutes for a table. Got a glass of Chardonnay that was delicious and waited it out by the bathrooms- there's a bench there that was empty!  Our server was a bit over the top but no water glass was left half full so that was nice. I had the BBQ ranch chicken salad which was ginormous. Didn't even finish it and I'm not one of the those ""oh couldn't possible eat all of this lettuce"" type of girls. I can eat. It was huge.  All 4 of us were happy and I took home a piece of the original cheesecake to share with my better half at home. So good- it was rich and creamy and I can see why it's the namesake item. I would go back for that any day."
Sierra R.,"Saint Marys, PA",48,19,2,5.0,10/26/2015,"Love relaxing here after shopping and getting some good grub with friendly service. Servers do an excellent job, I have eaten here numerous times and have yet to have an experience less than extraordinary. Love the large menu as I am always able to find something here that I am in the mood for."
Sheila B.,"Allison Park, PA",77,114,84,3.0,4/21/2014,"Always busy, always consistent.  Their menu amazes me.  I don't know how one restaurant can feel comfortable having a 20+ page menu spanning so many types of cuisine.  At my most recent visit, the bread, as always, is delightful.  I like the wheat bread that is soft and slightly sweet.  The sourdough is also a favorite, though I'm not a fan of any sourdough really.  My mom and I split the Cuban sandwich, which was my favorite menu item.  The ham, pulled pork, pickle and mustard just get along amazingly well.  The portions are HUGE, so definitely plan on splitting so you leave room for the best part, dessert!  Again, dessert is huge so either split, or a better idea, order it all for you and take some home for later!  I've tried many a cheesecake there, but my favorite is the original or the strawberry.  All cheesecake, less foo-foo stuff. The décor is over the top, but intentionally so.  The servers are always welcoming and helpful when it comes to deciding the cheesecake."
BJ B.,"Pittsburgh, PA",169,76,104,3.0,2/28/2015,The reason for this rating is due to the small size of the restaurant and the lack of a waiting area. There's people trying to eat and people are waiting over them. Whomever did the design of this restaurant in particular did not take into account the number of people who frequent this area. Cheesecake Factory is a popular chain that a plethora of people enjoy. I will probably not come to this location due to thr lack of waiting and standing over people while they are eating.
Daisy G.,"Philadelphia, PA",47,88,462,4.0,12/23/2014,"The cheesecake is awesome here! There is so many to chose from too! The Mac and cheese bites are a must try here. I wasn't impressed with the quesadillas, I would not recommend them at all."
Albert H.,"Cranberry Township, PA",237,7,5,3.0,4/4/2015,I would love to give this place 5 stars. The food and service is excellent. But this facility is just entirely too small and poorly laid out. In any business there's a bottle neck and this is it here. This location could benefit from a larger floor plan or a second floor. Anything would be better than what they have now.
Ed M.,"San Diego, CA",36,35,,3.0,1/16/2015,"Staff could use a little polishing, but overall a good experience."
Ken P.,"Pittsburgh, PA",18,19,,4.0,7/16/2013,"Part of me doesn't want to like this place, but let's be honest...for the most part, the food is freakin' delicious.  What I'm trying to get past though is the 500 page menu with nothing that is particularly healthy. Also, as a general rule I try to stay away from chains (it helps me feel more snobby). But like I said at the Cheesecake Factory, everything seems to taste great. On our last trip I went with the ""Bang Bang Chicken."" Sure, it wasn't what I'd expect from an authentic Thai restaurant, but I wouldn't have been at the CF if I wanted authentic Thai. For an American take on the dish I'll say it tasted awesome. If nutrition is on your mind, it's a bit tough to navigate the menu. You'll probably be able to get out under 1,000 calories, but you need to know what to look for, limit the alcohol intake and skip dessert. At the end of the day, if you're looking to meet up with friends it's a great venue. Tastes will appeal to almost anyone, the drinks are good, and if you're splurging, the Cheesecake is fantastic."
Tiffany Y.,"Pittsburgh, PA",5,553,,2.0,12/30/2014,"This restaurant has an extensive menu with wings, wraps, calamari, several salads, pizzas, burgers, sandwiches, pastas, steaks, some fish, tacos and enchiladas, of course cheesecake, etc. The restaurant was very overpriced for the quality of the food, and the service was very slow. I will never go to a Cheesecake Factory ever again."
M C.,"Zelienople, PA",0,126,5,5.0,1/20/2014,"It boggles my mind that this place only has 3 1/2 stars. I have been here probably 10-15 times over the last few years, and it so rarely disappoints (and by disappoints, I mean I eat something and don't say 'this is the best thing ever').  I do find them a bit overpriced, and that's the only thing that keeps me from eating there weekly. Some of my personal favorites...Cuban sandwich, crispy chicken costoletta, corn cake appetizer, firecracker salmon, orange chicken, and dinner salads are great. My favorite cheesecakes...mango key lime, pineapple upside down, raspberry lemon, banana (I seem to be in a fruity mood right now, but there are others too!). Basically, just top quality food and dessert. Fantastic presentation, too."
Rebecca W.,"Pittsburgh, PA",34,3,1,3.0,1/28/2015,"Went out to dinner with my husband.  I had the filet and garlic mashed potatoes.  Food was great and drinks were also tasty.  Mojito!  However, for a chain restaurant, I find the prices to be a big obnoxious.  Cocktails were $10 each!  Even with a $50 gift card we still spent an additional $115 for dinner and drinks for the two of us. AND THE WAIT WAS OVER TWO HOURS! No call ahead seating or reservations."
Stacey M.,"Greensburg, PA",0,7,,1.0,3/29/2015,Dirty silverware..dirty glasses and the bathroom was absolutely disgusting..I'd think twice about eating here..cleanliness has to be a top priority.
Emily S.,"Spangler, PA",0,7,,4.0,2/4/2016,Amazing food. It was so hard to pick which cheesecake to take home! So I picked 2! This place is a bit expensive so I go as a special treat but it's worth it. Also don't be surprised if you have to wait for a table.
