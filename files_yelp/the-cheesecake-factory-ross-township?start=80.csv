Mii B.,"Toronto, Canada",5,132,258,4.0,4/15/2011,"Yummie! Flavorful dishes indeed! Chicken in the gumbo was so tender and moist.....just melts in your mouth! If softer jasmine rice was used, it would have sure hit the spot!  Chipotle pasta also had a rich taste, a sweeter dish with the maple chicken. Portion sizes were large, doggy bag for sure. Service was friendly and attentive. Worth the wait time for a table, but can be avoided if your coordinate with your mall shopping time. Enjoy!"
Courtney B.,"North Myrtle Beach, SC",12,36,20,5.0,8/17/2014,"This is my husband and I's ""big date place"". We always come early because we eat dinner early (2:30). There is sometimes a wait, especially during December. Even once when we came on my birthday in December on a Monday. We are picky eaters, but we love our favorites from Cheesecake Factory. Currently we are on a fried chicken sliders and fries phase.  Delicious. The fries are delicious. It is very hard to find fried chicken in the area...any suggestions? I love the Strawberry Lemonade.  The alcoholic drinks are great, but pricey for the size.  We don't like cheesecake so I cannot give you my review of dessert since we've never gotten it. I always want to try a pasta dish, but never want to miss out on the fries."
Liz H.,"Gibsonia, PA",2,5,10,5.0,12/30/2014,"The food was divine! The cheesecake and the fresh basil, cheese, and tomato flatbread exceeded my expectations! My waiter was very kind and welcoming. I would defiantly go there again!"
Fred T.,"Nashua, NH",1,243,39,3.0,4/21/2013,"Its was an OK place for lunch. I went on a Saturday and the Mall parking lot was packed. When I stopped here at around 2pm the wait was about an hour they said so I found an open seat at the bar and ordered there.  The draft beer was pretty good, the rib eye steak with mashed potatoes was fantastic. I got the strawberry cheesecake for dessert and wasn't impressed. You figure The Cheesecake Factory would have great cheesecake but it tasted like it was made of a thick pudding. Maybe I'm used to New York type cheesecake, pretty firm with some nice taste, this wasn't it.  The place was packed and noisy, when i left around 4pm they were saying the wait was about 1.5 hours. Maybe if I just got the main course I wouldn't mind waiting but overall it was an average (and expensive) lunch."
Rachael B.,"CRANBERRY TWP, PA",0,5,,5.0,11/16/2015,Food was awesome as always.  Consistently good!  One of my favorite restaurants.
Erik M.,"Rochester Hills, MI",87,118,45,4.0,9/28/2011,"What is this place? Italian? Mexican? Chinese? Coma-inducing bakery? Yes.  This place is ridiculous. As I sat down (from a 10 minute wait. Guess I got lucky), I passed by what looked like EPCOT center. So many good looking plates of food from so many different cultures. I was wary that with a 15 page menu featuring advertisements the food would not be good, but I was pleasantly surprised. I got some sort of Italian thing and it was quite good. It seemed fresh and made today, not freeze-dried. The portions, like everything else in Pittsburgh food, are huge. So huge, we wound up getting our cheesecake to go to eat at home. Not a bad deal, but you'd want to eat it there considering it's called the Cheesecake Factory, not the Generic Styrofoam Take-Out Box Factory. I can see why people want to come here so much because you could eat here for 10 years and never get the same thing."
Mary W.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,3,,1.0,8/8/2015,"Went to Ross Park mall CCF tonight 8/8/15 was told 30 to 40 min for outside table when there were 5 open waited 30 min (now there were 8 open) and was told 10 more minutes!  Waited 15 got buzzed only to wait 7 minutes inside. Was seated at a table that was not cleaned or ready to be seated (one of the original tables that was empty when we got there).  Ordered drinks and food at the same time. Waiter came back with water and stated for the second time you need utensils we are not barbarians!!! Drinks came out in a timely fashion, my husbands food came out first and I was told ""yours will be right out honey""  7 min later our waiter came to check on us and said oh you don't have your meal let me check in that!! 5 minutes later I recorded my meal.   We were not checked on again until we were done eating!! Never going back!!!!  What once was a decent place to grab a bite has gone downhill!!!"
Julianna W.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,14,,4.0,5/28/2014,"Very good food, I am very picky so when I first look at the menu I was like "" nope this not the place for me "" bit then I saw that they had the food I did like and that I was farmilair with also they have a kids menu with a great selection sleekly for my kids and to top it off warm bread at your table whole grain and white bread"
Amy S.,"Brooklyn, NY",100,485,124,4.0,3/10/2012,"I think this is a good place to go when the members of your group can't agree on what to eat.. because they have almost everything you could possibly want. Sandwiches, burgers, pasta, seafood, chicken, steak, pizza, appetizers, and other stuff. And cheesecake of course. I got the jambalaya pasta today. I was in the mood for something spicy and this did the trick. It wasn't too hot where I was dying while eating, but good enough to get the kick. The chicken was so soft and the shrimp perfectly cooked. The linguine was really good too! Only thing was, it was a bit too oily and kind of heavy. (Sidenote: this dish only comes in full portion. I wish it came in lunch size because it's pretty big.) My friend and I also split a chocolate raspberry cheesecake. At first it's really good! but then it gets to be a bit too rich for my taste. Same for her, because we couldn't even finish it. Also, we were really full.  I really enjoy coming here cause they have good food, but sometimes their food is a bit too heavy/rich for my taste and the waits are really long. Also, because there are so many people service can be a bit slow sometime. Not unbearably slow, but noticeably slow. No reservations either. So, yeah. But their bread is good! Always."
Khalid A.,"Pittsburgh, PA",2,2,1,2.0,10/25/2011,"So I'm back in Pittsburgh for a couple of weeks and decided to go to cheesecake factory. I mean u can't go wrong with the cheesecake factory, iv been there before it's a safe choice for lunch or dinner. So anyway we sat down waited 15 mins for our waiter to come just to ask us what would u like to drink while still for our bread to come while need I to remind u that our utensils are soooo dirty we had to ask them for new ones twice until we decided to clean them our selfs and this was for after lunch hours wasnt very busy around 3ish pm place wasnt that packed. Ok now I ordered the sheperds pie while my mother got the lunch sized vegi pizza with salad my dad got the garlic noodles all the food was ""ok/good"" the garlic noodles were exceptional my shepherds pie was nothing to write home about tho, didnt get a chance to try moms pizza. Also be mindful that I have been here plenty of time and I can't stress this enough that the utensils were this dirty and service was horribly slow every single time.  So overall Food 3/5 Service 1/5 Bang for your buck 3/5 Decor 5/5 Cleanliness 1/5  I considered all these factors in my review"
Nick F.,"Haarlem, The Netherlands",178,767,309,4.0,12/30/2013,"I am not big on chain restaurants but this place is an exception.  Everything that I order is always really good.  This particular location is a bit smaller than most locations that I am used to and was packed.  We got in right after it opened so we did not have to wait but on our way out, there was a line out the door."
Kristopher P.,"Gibsonia, PA",6,54,1,4.0,11/30/2012,"We normally get take out because we don't like going there with kids.  I went to order (walk in) at 3:45 in the afternoon.  The woman took my order and told me it would only be about 15 mins. (I ordered 2 chicken salads and a piece of cheesecake).  I sat around for about 25 min. and was a little annoyed with the extra time because a large amount of the staff was standing around.  When my order came out, the woman who was at the bakery was easily the hardest working person at the time.  She was apologetic for my order taking extra time and gave me an extra piece of cheesecake at no additional cost.  I was very appreciative of this since I didn't ask for it.  She said it was the least they could do for making me wait longer.  We were very satisfied with this level of customer service.  Everything was good and we enjoyed our meal.   The reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 was the fact that this woman was killing herself at the bakery doing orders left and right while there were several other staff members standing around the bakery watching her work, not offering help, and at times they even seemed not aware that there were customers standing 5 feet away from them."
Scott A.,"Clinton, PA",0,9,,5.0,6/20/2015,Food was very good.  The service was GREAT!  Only negative I saw was the size of the menu.  There are to many choices.  No can ever say they couldn't find something to eat there.
Darren W.,"Pittsburgh, PA",2949,1450,4662,4.0,2/20/2011,"Mission: Lady Kay was owed an official belated St. Valentine's Day dinner. What did the dart land on? Cheesecake Factory. Wanting to avoid the wild, wooly South Side, we came all the way out to the Forbidden Land of Ross Park Mall.  Never before have I ever had to wait for over 2 hours to be seated anywhere. I was reluctant. ""I didn't come all the way out here to eat in a damned mall food court,"" Kay snarled, her hunger making her into someone that was not my beloved. ""But babe, I read that there's a Five Guys, and I always wanted to try..."" I saw cat's eyes, angry cat's eyes staring back at me.  ""Ok, give me the glowing beeper,"" I said to the kid behind the desk.  And off to the Mall we went to burn extra time.  When we returned, we waited another 20 minutes, played peekaboo with a darling baby girl who was being held by her dad, and were then seated.  By this point we were becoming flesh-munching undead.  Cheesecake Factory has a bewilderdingly extensive menu despite being centered around their dizzying varieties of cheesecake.  They also appear to have a fixation on that mobster of the vegetable world; the avocado. It's in half their dishes, from app's to ent's. They purport that their guacamole is as Sheetz sez, M-T-O. However, we already had something to tide us over at the mall, so we went straight for main courses.  I SO wanted to try that fresh guac though. So what did I do? I got it on a burger. No questions asked by our adept server Vicki, no funny stares.  CF calls 'em Glamburgers, and like the cheesecake, there are many different kinds. You'd think they'd have voluminous, teased-up hair and a thing for cocaine and groupies. Mine had American Kobe beef and came with grilled onions and mushrooms, but in addition to the guac, I got mayo, tomato, and lettuce, just to make it...rock.  And for the most part it did. It was served on a sweetly toasted and buttery sesame seed bun and came off like an Eat 'N Park Superburger that fell out of a limo and into a gutter wearing nothing but leather pants and boots.  I'd never had Kobe beef before, so here I was with a chance to try it. Now, it has been THE rage for a long spell. However, I also recall someone on   saying that it tasted like cat food. Hmmm. To my gaping maw, it was just a pretty damn fine burger. It wasn't as transcendent or ascendant as it had been hyped to be nor was it something passe as the Pitchforkesque foodies would have you believe. I mean, as a burger, this falls before the mighty Tessaro's or Cheeburger Cheeburger or Burgatory, but I can't say it would tap out easily. Pink inside, charred blacker than night on the outside, it makes a comeback before succumbing to an armbar in the 4th round.  NIIICE fries, guys, cooked twice 'cause they were illegally crispy/chewy. They come in a metal cup with an inlay of bakery tissue paper which I always find to be a cool, cool touch. The tin cup was HOT, though. Vicki told us she burnt her hand on it. Ow. Shepherd's Pie. A fancy chain like CF happens to have it on their menu (what don't they have?). I've never had it before until last night when I sampled what Lady Kay ordered.  Thumbs up, dude. Mashed potato, minced meat, it all held together well like the Thin Lizzy of old used to (cue the harmonized axe licks). I felt the thick, succulent comfort, y'know?  Dessert would come next, and if the large selection of cheesecake flavors isn't plenty, they have sundaes, cakes, apple cobblers, tiramisu, and even a plain bowl of strawberries. Dilemmas afire!  Inspired by an ill-fated visit to the store of the same name, Kay got the Godiva cheesecake. Feeling Aquarian, I went against the grain and got  Chris' Outrageous Chocolate Cake, which contains a layer of their Creamy Chocolate Chip Coconut Cheesecake. Each is served with clouds of whipped cream and their fresh hot fudge (for extra $).  Eh. Now, I got a gander at their brothel of goodies in the foyer and was tempted, but my chocolate cake turned out to be as what my reg'lars know as a bimbo dessert; all looks, not enough taste. Not that it was horrid. It looked like a dominatrix with all those chocochips acting as studs and was impressive to behold overall. It had a hide like an armadillo in fact. Upon taking a bite though, I could tell that it had been sitting around a while after having been shipped in suspended animation. I can think of a number of indy bakeries in Pittsburgh that best CF at their own game, easily. Fresh is always better.  Kay's cheesecake was a little more interesting, but if Godiva chocolate is that unaffordable, then folks are gettin' swindled. It was chilly and errr...moussy in flavor with a bombastic presentation. Fine to look at, when you get to know her, you find you weren't missing out. The whipped cream was flat and the runny hot fudge only slightly less-so. Yeah, we thought the desserts would rawk too. Bummer."
Elle E.,"Washington, DC",21,214,337,2.0,9/23/2013,Unfortunately this location does not know how to handle or accommodate the masses. We arrived for an early dinner around 4:45 pm on a Saturday. We were told there'd be a 45-60 minute wait...........we waited for an hour and a half for a table for TWO PEOPLE and still ended up walking out due to starvation. Need I mind you this is after we witnessed others come in after us and be seated before us.  Stop by on the weekends if you have 6 hours to spare.
John T.,"Cranberry Township, PA",0,8,7,3.0,4/28/2013,Good food and a good wait time. Would go again. A little expensive but big portions. We felt rushed as well.
Vicky C.,"Naples, FL",125,89,73,4.0,3/24/2011,"Umm, I adore the Cheesecake Factory. I'm a long time fan, and tried just about every dish on the menu.  Imagine how thrilled I was that I found one not too far from me! This Cheesecake Factory serves your standard, fabulous dishes. Taste is always up to par. Fresh food, beautiful decor.  And, the cheesecakes are SO good!"
Ruth Z.,"Pittsburgh, PA",2,21,,3.0,11/13/2012,The only reason I'm giving 3 stars is because of the lack of call ahead seating or reservations. The food was good as was the wait staff.  Excellent cheesecake!
Laura M.,"Pittsburgh, PA",9,15,9,3.0,11/10/2012,"I maintain that The Cheesecake Factory's menu is too large for its own good, but the service was great and the restaurant, as always, was comforting. The veggie burger (made with grains and...beets) was a bit above average--definitely better than I'd expected from a chain.  The Evelyn's pasta, though, was undercooked and mixed with charrred eggplant."
Benjamin B.,"St. Clairsville, OH",1,3,,2.0,1/30/2014,Service here is great! Amazing strawberry lemonade. I ordered the chicken marsala and was very surprised at the portion size... its HUGE.. they should lower their prices and decrease the portion sizes.. That isn't what subtracts the stars for me... it's the taste of the food... the marsala chicken was bland and dirty tasting... no flavor or anything. What a huge disappointment...
