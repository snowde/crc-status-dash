Leung Y.,"Toronto, Canada",7,38,301,4.0,12/24/2017,"After the 1 star review for the Toronto store, we decided to go Cheesecake Factory in the States :) We went there are lunch time on Dec 23 to the location right next to the busiest mall, and we were able to find parking nearby without paying for the valet service (which is at a extremely reasonable price for crazy holiday times at the mall!).  We went in and got seating right the way, at a great location inside. The waiter service was prompted.  He gave us water, automatically ask if we want lemon with it.  I asked for the brown bread only. I took a picture of the menu, and decide to go for my chubbilicious Chicken Marsala.  My chubby boyfriend got his burger and fries. The food took a while to arrive, and so I used the time for the bathroom.  Good god I love the USA bathroom.  Gigantic stalls and clean!  The water is a bit on the powerful side though.  They are smart enough to put a trash can next to the door, so you don't have to touch the door with you bare hands.  That is thoughtful. Food eventually arrives (after we ate 2/3 loaves of bread from the first basket).  The taste is as good as I remember.  Chicken is soft (4 slices).  Burger meat well cooked and still juicy.  Chicken Marsala pasta is a bit on the greasy side but I knew what I am getting when I ordered. I originally wanted to get the strawberry cheesecake, but got no more room after the large pasta order.  My boyfriend got his usually key lime cheesecake (which I stole a couple bite).  If you don't like whip cream, ask for no whip.  Some lactose intolerance guy argue saying they don't come with whip... and I was right!  Every order come with whip, unless you tell them you don't need it. We got our water refill without asking (but very close to ask). We were seated next to a big party with at least 5 kids and it was quite (despite all the sugar they were having!). I looked and the kids come with plastic cups with straws.  Very thoughtful. Gave it 4 stars only because I the arrival of the food was slow. I will return!  Just have to burn those carloies first before I could return.  The skinny menu options ain't bad, but I am going to the dark side :)"
Gisele X.,"Sacramento, CA",47,223,486,4.0,12/18/2017,"I had a good dining experience tonight at Cheesecake Factory. The two of us were sat quickly, within 5-10 minutes. There were larger parties waiting. Our server, a woman in her 40s-50s, with shoulder-length hair, was our server. She provided stellar service. That was the highlight for me. The pepperoni pizza was ok. The white chocolate caramel macadamia cheesecake was ok. I'm no fan of the airy flavorless puffs they put on the plate. (Sorry for whining.) It's difficult for me to write a review on a large chain restaurant. I'm rarely a fan of chain restaurants. They usually underwow me with the quality of their food offerings. I'm especially not a fan of chains with a lot of blind followers. (It doesn't deserve a wait of more than 10-15 minutes, but doesn't every location always have an outrageous wait time?) I've been to Cheesecake a dozen times or so in the past 20 years. I'll go (once in a while) if that's what someone really wants, but meh, I could live without. Four stars because the service was great and the food was ok."
Ray H.,"Carmichael, CA",4,73,58,1.0,12/16/2017,"In the last month we've been here three times. First time Oscar was our server. He was very good. If we asked if they could make something a little different he would go and check. He was  very accommodating and deserves 5 stars.    Then we had somebody she never told us her name but the first thing she did when she came over was to ask if we wanted bread?  That seemed unusual because we've been coming here over 20 years and I servers just bring you the bread to the table. It maybe she's stupid because when we asked her what the difference was between two dishes she said the sauce was just different. The statement the sauce is just different is so ambiguous what is that supposed to tell the customer? It turned out one dish was covered with cold chopped tomatoes vs a tasty lemon-garlic sauce (a male perhaps the kitchen manager knew exactly what we wanted THANKFULLY)   Tonight we've been sitting at a table for an hour, when I finally got my strawberry smoothie (i will say is very very good). I ordered an appetizer which came out the same time as my entree. Seriously am I suppose to eat both of the same time?  So they said they would bring the entree out later. Little did I realize it would be the same entree burnt marks and all.    Lucky for us our waitress was taking a break from the gentleman who replaced her seems to have his active gather whoever it is thank you."
Joseph T.,"Sacramento, CA",17,30,48,5.0,12/28/2017,"I came for Happy Hour, and I had one of the most best Happy Hour experiences of my life. I usually go to restaurants for Happy Hour, and am usually disappointed by the subpar selection. However, not with this place. I had 3 drafts on tap, 3 humongous plates of food, and complimentary bread!  The ambiance was smooth yet lively. And the best part about it was that I was treated like a King. Tim was my bartender, and he was super friendly, yet professional. He checked in with me quite often to see if I needed anything, and I didn't ""feel rushed."" I will definitely be going back!! Great job guys!!"
Yao C.,"Sacramento, CA",231,343,3605,3.0,8/27/2017,"Cheesecake Factory is always so so busy! This place is a great place for large parties, family get togethers, and even romantic dates! The bar area is cool because it's large with tvs so you can eat appetizers and watch the football games!  Parking is okay, can get very busy but there is plenty of parking because it's connected with the mall. They also have valet parking as well. Food is average, nothing spectacular! They have a wide variety of choices which is good when you bring a large group but I feel the food is only mediocre.  I've had their burgers, to pastas to the steak. Just recently I had the spicy crispy chicken sandwich and it was very dry... the chicken was not moist but the chipotle mayo was good. I also tried the BBQ burger and again, it was dry.... overcooked. The fries are crispy and good but the burgers are only so so. My lady had the fish tacos and they were good, not great. You can have your fish tacos either fried or grilled and we had it grilled which was a good decision....  We tried 3 different apps... the deep fried mac and cheese balls, stuffed mushrooms and fried zucchini! The mushrooms were small and you only get 6... flavor blend.... the zucchini was small and lacked flavor. The fried mac and cheese balls were really good... good batter and flavor... my favorite of the night. Cheesecake is their signature dish.... i tried the white chocolate raspberry cheesecake and it was good and light but too much whip cream!  Overall, it's a fun place for get togethers but food is only mediocre.... not bad but not stunning!  Lastly, they do not take reservations and you have to be prepared to wait at least 35-40 minutes! Solid 3 stars!"
Rosa P.,"Sacramento, CA",23,102,61,2.0,9/13/2017,"What happened?!  What happened to the ONE chain restaurant I could always count on in Sacramento. Ugh, what a disaster.  If Monday wasn't already shitty enough, Cheesecake made sure to put the final nail in the coffin.  Got to CF with friends around 7/710p. We waited abt 10 min to be greeted by our waitress and waited abt another 10 for water. I asked for straws as I hate drinking straight from the cup. ( I know, I'm a psycho). After the third time, I eventually ended up asking another waitress for the damn straws.  We were finally able to order and also asked her for more bread while we waited. After asking twice, she brings more bread and ends up spilling my water all over the table, my sweet potato fries and my lap. Sigh.... at this point, I thought: maybe she's busy and stressed? Idk, I try to give ppl the benefit of the doubt.  That changed when my meal came. We didn't get our dinner until after 8p and my meal was just a plate of orange chicken. Lol no rice. My friend ordered the Carne Asada steak medallions and it was three pieces of meat while the rest of the plate was covered in rice and whatever else they threw on there to make it look full.  Once our food arrived, our waitress disappeared. Never saw her again. Up until it was time for her to get the tab paid.  We eventually asked for the manager as the entire night was just one failing disaster after another. He was attentive and ended up giving us 25% off our tab. He left aaaaannnndddd our waitress never came back! After waiting for her for about 15 min, we ended up walking up the hostess to find us someone to help close us out.  I was craving CF soooo bad and this experience just sucked balls. I was disappointed in the way we were waited on. She was hardly attentive and seemed like everything we asked for was a nuisance. (But it was all basic shit we should have gotten) I usually always sit in the bar area and am always treated so awesome by the staff there.  I really wanted a piece of cheesecake, but by the end of the night I just wanted to get out of there. Dammit."
Kelly C.,"Davis, CA",304,171,200,3.0,11/12/2017,"This Cheesecake factory location is smaller than most. With the limited seating, there is usually a long wait time, so when my boyfriend and I went around dinner time on a Friday night, I was expecting the wait to be longer than 30 min. However, after waiting exactly 25 minutes, we were seated.  Food is not that great. Super oily/greasy and HUGE portions (it's what they're known for). I got a pasta dish and was able to eat 1/3. I took the other to go. My boyfriend on the other hand was super hungry and ate it all. One thing I do love about the cheesecake factory, is the brown bread!! I usually ask for seconds.  The cheesecake is bomb, but I never have room to eat it after such a large meal. (but you can order the cheesecake to go!)"
Leilani L.,"Sacramento, CA",203,59,64,3.0,9/11/2017,"So... I'm pretty sure I picked the worst Monday to go to CF. Normally, service would be outstanding. My food is usually fantastic and brought out in a decent amount of time. Giving them 3 stars because of all of the other pleasant experiences there, prior to this one. Here's what happened, yes, all in one night: never got a soup spoon with my bowl of soup, (it's a giant bowl), we asked for straws three times with two different people, our server spilled water all over our table and my friend by accidentally dropping the butter dish for the bread, they replaced the fries that the water spilled on, but not her utensils and napkin. Our server was completely apologetic but I felt like we had to ask for everything! This is only for the service.... Now for the kitchen: it took about 45 mins for our food to come out. We waited so long that the booth behind us had 2 different parties that had come and gone. Also, My friend that got spilled on ordered orange chicken with extra vegetables and white rice. Our server wrote it down right but the kitchen plated it without rice. My other friend ordered carne asada medallions with rice... her poor plate had 3 chunks of meat on it... it looked like the saddest plate in the world! If you're hungry, don't order that! I know I sound like I'm just complaining but this was bad this time around. We did speak to the manager and he tried to make it better but I feel like this last time around may be the last."
Yani R.,"Sacramento, CA",21,17,13,1.0,12/30/2017,First time ordering to go from this spot. Will not do it again. The staff was all over the place. I just burned 14.50. I ordered a Caesar Salad for my daughter and instead ended up with something completely different with fruit.  Not a happy customer
Allen Y.,"West Sacramento, CA",133,67,169,4.0,10/31/2017,"They have the best cheesecake! I mostly come here to grab a slice and leave. You can order a slice by going up to the front counter where the cheesecake display is and order a whole cake or a slice. And you just pay and leave. Simple and fast. I rarely dine in. The food was good but nothing to rave about. First time, I had the garlic lemon chicken. It was cooked in a fire oven and was super juicy and delicious. The lemon juice really shines through. It came with cooked carrots and mash potatoes. Carrots were not cooked all the way so it was still hard. Mash potatoes were definitely like a 2/5. But hey, at least they nailed the protein which really matters. I have tried their pastas and burgers dishes but they were nothing to rave about.  My friends always come here to get me a slice of cheesecake to go on my birthday. So if any of my friends are reading this, you know what to get me for my birthday. Wink Wink :)"
Erika N.,"Sacramento, CA",227,84,40,3.0,8/12/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory is okay to me. Nothing to rave about. My family and I Came here for lunch today at around 12pm. We got seated right away which was great. Our server was okay. I mean he checked on us, the food runners brought us our food, got our drinks. Nothing super exciting or fun about him.  We ate our food, sat about 10-15 min for the bill and we were on our way. Again, to rave about."
Paul P.,"Rohnert Park, CA",29,147,1070,4.0,10/5/2017,"Where back once again at the Cheesecake Factory,  for the delicious BANG BANG SHRIMP, and the wonderful pinko breaded chicken breast with asparagus and garlic mash potatoes these are appetizers and entrées that we really like here I tried to order different things I just can't bring myself to do it yet I will in the future though we love this cheesecake factory there the best"
Julie P.,"Northern California, CA",6,146,456,3.0,5/29/2017,"What the heck happened to the Cheesecake Factory? We sat at one of the tables in the bar area  for faster service. There were 2 of us and we sat at table with 4 seats. There were already 4 small appetizer plates and 4 silverware sets.  We ordered the French onion soup and Thai lettuce wraps. The lettuce wraps were good , no complaints. It came with noodles, carrots, cucumbers and bean sprouts. And chicken satay of course. There was peanut sauce and a ginger sauce. The 3rd sauce was good but I'm not sure what it was made out of. There were large pieces of lettuce to wrap all the goodies in.  The French onion soup was lame. There was not enough cheese in it. Not sure if this was the ""low cal"" version or what.   Service was ok. I do like to be left alone when I'm at a restaurant.  The biggest disappointment has to be those 4 plates on the table. Each and every one of those small appetizer plates had food particles stuck to them and looked visibly dirty.. Greasy finger marks or something !! I opened all the silverware and there was food stuck to those as well! Disgusting. This is why I prefer to eat at home.   Maybe it's time for a new dishwasher! Gross.  The best part about our visit today was the carrot cake :) Maybe the crummy-ness of the experience has to do with the shit hole area it's in. The Arden area by the mall is nasty. I'll go to Roseville if I feel the need to go to Cheesecake Factory ever again."
Souporn H.,"Escondido, CA",73,132,14,5.0,9/24/2017,Cheesecake Factory will always be my favorite!! Delicious food and I'll always have room for dessert. Unless service is bad I wouldn't rate it less. I know It's not the fanciest thing but I love eating here.
Arnel S.,"Larchmont Countryroads, Sacramento, CA",20,129,91,4.0,5/28/2017,"My family came here with a guest on a day when graduations were being celebrated all over the county!  So the restaurant was packed to the brim...and the waiting time was around half an hour.  But since we decided to eat at the outside tables, we were called inside in about 5 minutes! In spite of the place being packed, I felt the service didn't even feel the pinch.  Our waitress was good...in spite of being spread thinly across all the tables she served. The food was okay.  I ordered medium-well and from what I received, it looked more like well-done...but the wife insisted that at my age, I should always order well-done, so I guess that was good(?).  Presentation was also good.  It could've been better.  And the cheesecakes for dessert were huge and heavy.  We shared a cheesecake and ordered a few more to go. It's a great place to go for standard fare...and the signature cheesecakes!  My family and I will be back..."
Yousaf Z.,"West Sacramento, CA",154,36,80,4.0,9/12/2017,"I've been coming here for years since I am a Sacramento native; I've been extremely pleased for the most part! I always got the Steak Diane and it was just lovely. It was always cooked to perfection! Definitely recommend for you mean eaters!  I've been trying to eat less meat and dairy, so I ordered the vegetarian burger this time with a dude of fries. The burger was not tasty at all, it broke apart as soon as I grabbed it and wasn't cooked/mixed well because the rice and beans they used was still in tact. Do not recommend this.  I'm also really upset about the fact they charge for their Special ranch sauce that I used to have with their brown (wheat) bread. This wasn't too pleasing to me and actually took me back given that we pay a good amount per portion. Other than that, the overall experience is usually and was this time really good. I will still continue to go but just choose a different meat free option.  Good luck!"
Lani N.,"Sacramento, CA",13,44,31,3.0,11/27/2017,"Service was great but I cannot say the same about everything on the menu.  The appetizers were delicious; we had the fried zucchini and calamari. Bomb dot com!  Then we ordered the Shrimp Scampi, Hibachi Steak, and Macaroni & Cheese Burger. The pasta was flavorless and the shrimps, well, not the best. The burger was not impressive. The mac&cheese overwhelmed the burger so I removed it and the burger was mediocre. The steak didn't look too good so I did not care to try it."
John H.,"Sacramento, CA",0,44,,5.0,12/3/2017,"Well, just had lunch with my wife for her B-day....I had the best pasta carbonara I've had since I left New Jersey 30+ years ago, and my wife had a turkey & bacon with avocado sandwich, and we both LOVED the flavor and presentation of our meals.  Our waiter was there every time we needed anything but never there asking ""how is everything"" when we took a big bite of something delicious.   My pasta was cooked just right, not too firm and not soggy, and spiced perfectly.  The flavor was outstanding.  My wife's turkey bacon sandwich was fresh, tender, and delicious.  Of course we had desert.  My wife, the salted caramel cheesecake and I had the seasonal pumpkin cheesecake.   No disappointments anywhere.....we will be back..again an again!"
Henry L.,"San Mateo, CA",2336,833,2811,4.0,1/28/2017,"Nice The place is located right outside of the mall. You actually have to walk outside for quite a while to get to it, because it's near the outside boundary of the parking lot. Outside, the structure looks huge, like some kind of church. Inside, the decoration is also fancy, with paintings on the wall, dim lighting, and lots and lots of customers waiting for tables. You get a vibrating device that notifies you when your table is ready. There is a huge cheesecake counter right next to the waiting area so you will be more than hungry before you sit down looking at all the cheesecake! The service are all quick and friendly. The food took a while to come out, but that's only because they have so many customers. The food was amazing! I got the Factory sandwich, which was actually toasted hard on the outside. There was lots of beef and ingredients. The angel hair pasta was also cooked pretty nicely, served warm and and lots of flavor. The Cosmo cocktail was fruity and sweet. Finally, the free bread was awesome, especially the black bread which actually tasted sweet. Nice Definitely worth going back again."
Nicole B.,"Elk Grove, CA",269,211,644,4.0,7/10/2017,"My two cents on Cheesecake  Atmosphere-  Usually located in most midsize and large cities.Besides Sac I have been to Walnut Creek, LA, Atlanta, with San Francisco being my favorite.  Spacious, good size bar,  plenty of seating. Casual while being slightly elegant.  Great place for a casual date, family, outing or special occasion.   Service- Like most chains hit or miss. Some occasions service is stellar. Can get prompt, friendly, efficient service. Other times you can get a subpar server, and service can be slow.  Food-  The highlight of Cheesecake factory is the wide variety of their menu. From the burgers, salads, appetizers, to full size entrees they have something for everyone. Servings are generous and the food is always tasty. Wide variety of cocktails that are delicious with many creative non alcohol drinks as well.  And of course their Cheesecake....So many choices,  creamy and with a good size crust..My favorites are the white chocolate raspberry and the banana caramel.  Salivating just writing this review!"
Em L.,"Sacramento, CA",216,724,40,5.0,1/31/2017,"Having never been to this Cheesecake Factory, I was excited to try out this suburban institution. It was packed at 8:00 pm mid-week, and only got busier.  The cheesecake & desserts are delicious. I see the appeal! We also ordered fried apps - fried avocodo, fried mushrooms, fried zuchinni. All light and crispy, not too salty."
Amanda S.,"Stockton, CA",108,1,,1.0,12/27/2017,"I am only rating this due to them not doing reservations even though their website says they do do them. I called to set up a reservation for dinner and I was told it's a first come first serve... I live an hour away, and the people I have invited live even further. My guests agreed to dinner here because they know I love this place, but to have to come hours early just so I can get a table before everyone else is ridiculous. I will always return because like I said I love this place but they need to make things easier on people who live further away that are visiting their establishment."
Linda S.,"Sacramento, CA",116,242,873,4.0,1/5/2017,"One of my fave spots for happy hour. I need like 2 long island and I'm good. Although, I've tried the mojito, cosmo, etc. Long island is a bang for the buck and if I'm drinking, might as well drink something that'll make me happy at happy hour. The food off the hh menu is decent and tasty enough to call it dinner. Down side is the number of tables/bar stools for hh is so little that people often find themselves standing around waiting for a table or open seats. The prices have gone up from $5 to $5.xx closer to $6 bucks.  I've frequent here for dinner as well. I typically order the cajun chicken littles, jambalaya, steak diane, and the other steak dish that I forgot. I've never had a bad waitress/ waiter here, so I feel lucky and I still keep coming back."
Vitaliy A.,"Roseville, CA",27,91,278,4.0,7/6/2017,"Great place for it's prices! Quality of food is good! The service is good as well! Really like their miso salmon, stake diana!!! And of course, their cheesecakes are amazing!!!"
Robert S.,"Vallejo, CA",96,1,1,1.0,6/24/2017,"Let me begin this review by saying I've never been inclined to post a review before. The fact that I've been driven to it in itself should say a lot about my experience here. We were seated quickly and our server came and asked us what we would like to order, we ordered and that was the last time we would see him for the next 45 mins. Once the food arrived (sent by someone else) one of our orders was wrong ( we asked for cheese on our sliders they came to the table without). We informed the person who brought our food of the mistake and it was taken back to the kitchen to be corrected.  When the sliders came back the cheese had been torn (by hand) and tiny broken pieces were added to each slider. The manager ""apologized"" rushing us asking again and again as we tried to address the issue ""well do you want the sliders taken of the bill?"" The original server (who mysteriously returned to serve the table next to us again and again throughout this ordeal) instead of apologizing issued excuses for both his absence (I was busy with other tables) and the poor quality of the food (it was the kitchen)  As I began with I don't ever review on yelp I'm a pretty even keel person and know that bad service can be the result of a bad day and I would hate to do something to potentially hurt a business or endanger a job but service from our server to management was lacking. I will be sending this review to corporate as well hopefully they can do better for other customers but I will not be back personally."
Terri N.,"Concord, CA",532,725,2900,4.0,6/28/2017,"Consistently good experiences here!   Once you get past the overwhelming nature of the Cheesecake Factory experience and are a seasoned pro, no longer startled by their menu so large it contains advertising space, their reliability and predictability can make them a very safe and satisfying option. Whether that's a good or bad thing is entirely up to you! As for me, I dig it!  I have two very safe go-to meals at the Factory - their fantastic Thai For White People dish called Bang Bang Chicken & Shrimp (coconut peanut heaven, and easily 3 meals on one plate), and their killer Club Sandwich, probably the best club sandwich I've ever had. Generous of course, with nice fresh ingredients, but what makes it for me is some sweetness in the sandwich bread - it elevates the sandwich into the heavens and makes it so much more than savory. And everything at the Factory makes wonderful leftovers - which they must anticipate, with their insane portion sizes.  Don't forget about the cheesecake!  And disregard so many other reviewers throwing caloric shade on dessert - don't kid yourself about where you're eating dinner. And friendly reminder, they are more than happy to box up a slice of cheesecake for you, which for me always last a couple days! Everything in moderation, including moderation. And if you still doubt, don't forget you can order a bowl of fresh strawberries for dessert too, you silly people you. But you could also score a slice of their amazing lemon meringue cheesecake, or the glorious red velvet, or the orgasm that is the Limoncello cream torte. Go big - the Factory wants you to.  Always keep in mind that this place is a gold mine, and they don't take reservations! A wait is damn near guaranteed. Don't get mad at them for being popular, and attached to a mall! I will definitely be back. A visit to Cheesecake Factory is like a visit to a reliable old friend - you know what to expect, and you know you'll walk away smiling. And that ain't a bad thing!"
Carl Vincent C.,"Sacramento, CA",478,122,332,2.0,2/3/2017,"I've been here a few times and never thought to write a review until today.  TL;DR Service: 5/5 Food: 2/5 I ordered hot water with slices of lemon on the side and I grabbed the spoon that was on the table to mix my lemon water. I didn't realize until I took the spoon out but there was a lump of dried spinach on the spoon that wasn't washed off properly. I checked the other utensils on the table and saw food that didn't get washed from each of the utensils as well. Our server was kind enough to replace my water and utensils quickly and apologized for the mess.  We also ordered the Skinnylicious Grilled Turkey Burger and the Old Fashioned Burger. Both mediocre and bland. I mean, the pictures really speak for themselves. I'm no food critic, but I would appreciate cleanliness and better than average food for the prices I'm paying."
Marley W.,"Sacramento, CA",142,4,,5.0,11/22/2017,Ask to sit in ZACK's section!  He was very kind and super attentive. I've been to this location many times and he is by far my favorite! Thank you for the great experience !
Nathan Y.,"Carmichael, CA",175,308,72,3.0,6/19/2017,"Holy cripes, this place is packed. It was super-crowded, but fortunately, there's a fast turnover, so we didn't have to wait too long for a seat. The service was fast, but it was rather inattentive (which I found ironic given that we were surrounded by Eye of Saurons decorating the seating area). The dirty dining floor and restrooms needed cleaning. Our waiter also forgot one of our entrees. It was actually a hidden blessing that he forgot because the portions we got for everything else were huge. First, we were given 3 servings of bread for 2 people. The sweet multi-grain bread tasted amazing with the slightly-salty butter. Neither of us liked the rye bread, but it's not like either of us were compelled to finish it. Second, my gf got full off the appetizer dish by itself. I ordered the Flying Gorilla, a chocolate alcoholic mixer. It was like a really good spiked chocolate milkshake, and I highly recommend it. The fried calamari appetizer was crispy and overall quite tasty. The tomato basil pasta with chicken was average, but enjoyable. All of this was comfort food. The dishes were expensive, but they were also huge, so order accordingly."
Ashley S.,"Sacramento, CA",157,105,94,4.0,10/1/2017,Were we lucky or whaaat? Walked in and expected a long wait but with a party of 10 we were sat immediately after my party showed up. Our server was great and attentive to our needs. The loaded potato tots were my favorite!! The loaded mushroom bites were delicious too. I had the catfish dinner and that was tasty.
Kevin K.,"Berkeley, CA",526,188,514,2.0,12/23/2016,"The Mediocre Factory . . . It's easy to be taken in by the ""classy"" ambiance of the Cheesecake Factory, but it really is all just smoke and mirrors.  The food isn't that great at all, and HORRIBLY overpriced.   I know I like to whine about overpriced food on yelp from time to time, but Cheesecake Factory really prices their food too high.  I don't think a bacon cheeseburger is worth $15.  Pasta da vinci, albeit decent, isn't worth $18 either.  It's just pene pasta with chicken in wine sauce.  I could make that at home for $4.     Obviously the food does indeed taste decent, but it's definitely a splurge every time I come here.  I don't quite get the huge hype surrounding the CF.   When my friends and I were served our food the other night, we all started eating and almost immediately, my friend found a hair in her pasta and it took a while for us to wave down our waitress, Jess to send the dish back.  Hair is always a disgusting find in a dish.  Needless to say, it seemed that our experience at the CF was turning into a CF. It wasn't Jess' fault.  It was a very busy night at Cheesecake.  It was just sad because my friend had a delay in her eating.  Jess apologized profusely and was very polite about getting my friend a new dish.  The manager even came right up and apologized and comped her entree from the bill.   It was a really nice display of customer service. Jess took wonderful care of us during the whole time though.  Even though I'm not super big on the food at CF, I know good customer service when I see it, and Jess definitely had it.   I ordered a burger and my friends all ordered pasta dishes, with which we were fairly pleased.  I don't like getting little cups of ketchup delivered to me with my burger.  Just give me the bottle please so I can properly drown my burger and fries in ketchup!  It's nice to look classy, but not with ketchup.  It's not amazing food, but it was alright and I had a really nice time with my friends on their last night in town. I definitely wouldn't class my food as anything above mediocre, but it was made up for by the exceptional customer service we experience there from Jess and the manager who was so accommodating.   None of this changes the fact that I just don't really like the food (or the prices, omg) at Cheesecake factory.  It's a lovely looking place with nice and helpful staff, but that's about it. Good job to Jess though!"
Helen V.,"Citrus Heights, CA",0,18,1,5.0,12/22/2017,Absolutely impressed at how fast we were greeted and seated. The one in Corte Madera & San Francisco is a little bit on the slow end. Cheesecake was delicious as always Shout out to the valet who was freezing his knickers off I applaud your commitment and dedication. Raise pay he deserves it. Kid could catch a cold standing outside for hours like that.
Elena I.,"West Sacramento, CA",4,2,2,5.0,11/10/2017,"One of my favorite places to go to for dinner. Never had any complaints about the food, it's always good. The dessert variety is amazing - I feel like you can find any possible flavor of cheesecake. And what I like the most about this place is the romantic atmosphere they have inside, with dimmed lights, music playing, etc. Always brings me positive emotions :)"
Cheryl E.,"Sacramento, CA",189,164,247,4.0,12/21/2016,"I come to the Cheesecake Factory very seldomly. But every time I come the service is pretty good. Even on busy days the waiters/waitresses are very attentive to our table.  Their portion sizes are fairly large. I feel like each dish is more than enough for two. I always take my left overs home and they're always still pretty good the day after.  My last visit there, for our appetizers we ordered the crab bites and stuffed mushrooms. Now these portions were really small. Came with about 6 pieces each. They were literally bite sized pieces.  For our main dishes we ordered the everything pizza, and the jambalaya pasta. I wasn't too big on the pizza, nothing about it really stood out to me. The jambalaya said it was going to be in a very spicy sauce, but I felt it was mild. The shrimp and chicken pieces were very tender and juicy. As for the sauce of the pasta, it was just ok to me. Again, nothing stood out.  For dessert we ordered the salted caramel cheesecake. And holy moley! It was sweet. Very rich and creamy. And their slices are always very generous. I never finish them either, so it's always a good idea to share that as well."
Desee R.,"Sacramento, CA",121,74,832,3.0,8/22/2017,"My friends and I decided to come here for dinner on a Monday at 7:15pm. We were seated right away. Our server never introduced herself and when she asked us what we wanted to drink...I asked for water...she rolled her eyes and walked away immediately. She came back about 5 mins and brought our waters and stale bread. We didn't say anything. We were deciding to get a bottle of wine but we asked if we can get a sample first of the 2 sweets ones. She rolled her eyes and again walked away without saying anything...at this point I feel like we bother her. Brought our wine about 15 mins later with 2 glasses and knowing we have 3 people dining. So we asked for another glass and once again showed us the biggest attitude. We asked if we can order our appetizer...ummm isn't it your job to ask us what we want to get?! I told her ""excuse me, hey girl!"" (to get her attention since she never introduced herself to us) and she said ""my name is Jessica ok"" lol ok sorry! I feel like she don't want to deal with us at all. We were seated for more than an hour and still without any food on our table besides the stale bread. I asked for the manager and told her about the situation..she changed our server to D'andre. Omg this guy is the best!!! He was very entertaining and super attentive! We just loved him. He took our orders, we got Thai lettuce wraps, truffle-honey chicken, and steak Diane.. which we really enjoyed! He was chatty and really made our dinner very enjoyable. We got our food in a timely manner as well. He made sure everything was good and I couldn't ask for anything more. We also ordered 3 oreo cheesecakes to go and another item. We gave him a big tip after that. 3 stars because food was superb and outstanding customer service from D'andre and all negative coz of Jessica. I'm sorry but I feel she doesn't know what a good customer service is like. Coming back but hope we get D'andre again."
Darryl D.,"Elk Grove, CA",222,52,9,5.0,12/8/2017,The manager was nice and Lamont was really good but the food wasn't as great. This review is because they worked so hard to nake sure the food was good but it's like the cook forgot that food needs flavor.
Terence N.,"Sacramento, CA",47,20,,4.0,10/21/2017,"WELL-MANAGED RESTO WITH COMPETENT SERVERS 1. VERSATILE SERVICE - we went on a very packed day. Despite this, the wait was not as long as we expected, the server immediately gave us bread gave drinks and took our orders. The server was obviously tired but he managed to do pretty well considering how busy it was. He didn't forget anything and we got our food within 30 minutes of ordering. Something like this usually from experienced management and staff.  2. CONSISTENTLY GREAT FOOD- Ive never had a bad order here and the one I did i remember the manager came out to apologize and they replaced it entirely.  3. GREAT SELECTION FOR BUDGET - their factory combination is a great way to get a good selection for great price and satisfying portions.  4. GREAT LOCATION - As always great location right next to Arden Mall and the movie places along with other good places in the arden fair area.  5. NEEDS CHANGE - The only thing I would say is that since they have optimized the business operations thst they should start innovating some new things to expand the cheesecake factory brand into either new ways to present their product or introduce a new product in a new segment.  CONCLUSION: Great well balanced resto that you can count on. Its time to do more."
Vadym N.,"North Highlands, CA",16,11,31,4.0,10/22/2017,I had great experience over there. Great food big portions and descent price. Cream of mushroom and chicken is bom
Monica K.,"Martinez, CA",42,205,268,4.0,4/5/2017,"You know what you're going to get when you eat at the Cheesecake Factory. However, the food is always consistent,  and the service is too. My co-workers and I came here for dinner, and even though it took longer than expected to get seated, the manager made it up to us. My go to is always the fresh vegetable salad, however I tried the lemon garlic shrimp from the skinnylicous menu, and it did not disappoint.  I think their drinks and appetizers are the best.  The atmosphere here is nice, dim lighting in the evening, and casual wear is fine. This location is right next to the arden fair mall, so if theres a long wait, its nice to browse at the mall or the other surrounding stores."
Rusty C.,"Colusa, CA",25,32,68,4.0,5/31/2017,Always a nice place to come too when my wallet Is feeling too fat!  But more seriously the food has never disappointed and the Cheesecake selections are out of this world!  I would gain 15 lbs just drooling over the display case of all those cheesecakes!
