Ricky M.,"Sacramento, CA",103,6,5,5.0,6/16/2017,What way to start A father's Day weekend  my wife order me the gumbo. It's so good it was delivered by door dash. Hot fast. . We truly thank The Cheese Cake  factory.  For the great food .  And Door dash.
Ani C.,"Sacramento, CA",53,59,64,5.0,9/2/2016,"First time here for happy hour. I came in about 4pm on a Friday. Missed the traffic and plenty of parking. The staff was nice and was seated immediately. I decided not sit at a table and sit at the bar instead. The pink lemonade drink was refreshing. The bartender was great! We ordered potstickers, buffalo blasts, and sliders. They were all good esp on the pocket. I will return."
Kyle C.,"Sacramento, CA",384,57,25,4.0,10/23/2016,"Cheesecake is kinda basic, but I can't get enough of this place. I can't compare it to a Mulvaneys or a Biba, but any place that I crave and eat at 2-3 times per month gets 4 stars in my book.  Notes for improvement: - the drive-up process takes a long time. I waited 20 mins last week.  - change the To-Go containers to include vents, otherwise the food gets soggy and wet from condensation"
Shalvin S.,"Elk Grove, CA",155,94,129,4.0,3/13/2016,"Usually when I'm in the Arden area I don't think to go here but I should because the food is awesome. I ordered a buffalo blast as an appetizer and it came with enough to feed the entire table. These little boneless wings are spicy, crispy, and tasty.  Also I orders the spicy crispy chicken sandwich w/ chipotle sauce. The ambience is phenomenal, and the portions are huge. I split both dishes with my date and we still had food to take home. We were both extremely full and satisfied.  Only reason I didn't give 5 stars was because the service was a bit slow. It took a while for the waiter to take our order, bring our drinks, and even ask for refills. They were not that busy but the food was great."
Dave N.,"Woodbridge, CA",14,66,398,3.0,12/6/2015,"I occasionally come here with my lady who's a big fan of this place. When we're hungry, we'll literally drive about an hour to Sacramento just to come here. Imagine driving about an hour out of town only to be met with a 20-40 minute waiting list. I jokingly tell her lets go to Cheesecake Factory when I'm not even hungry. It has gotten to a point where I know in about an hour and a half later before we even get inside and get seated and I know we'll both be hungry at that point. You really have to pick the right days to come in. Clearly Friday nights and Saturdays are going to be busy. Expect a bit of a wait.  Onto the food. This place has so many dishes on the menu it's incredible. If you aren't feeling a burger and fries, they have pizza. If you aren't wanting pizza they have mexican food. If you don't want mexican food they have (list goes on and on here). Dead serious here. The menu can accommodate anyone's pallet. I think the issue is obvious here. With so many dishes on the menu, how do the cooks hone in and specialize on any dishes? From my experience and hearing the opinions of others, they really haven't. The food is certainly average at best. The portion sizes aren't consistent each time I visit.  There have been times where you could tell your food was finished along time ago, but with the amount of tables your waiter or waitress is balancing, they're getting it out to you a few minutes later. This may not necessarily be the truth because this place has staff moving from the kitchen to tables, but it's been too many occasions now where the only thing somewhat warm on my plate is the orange chicken. Imagine being hungry for a couple of hours now, having traveled 48 miles only to be told there's a few people in front of you we'll need you to wait a bit, and then you're served average tasting semi-warm food. This has only been my luck here, as my girl's food always appears to actually be steaming hot.  What I feel this place has going for it is the interior and obviously the cheesecake. Their cheesecake is to die for! If your meal is mediocre, end it with a cheesecake and you'll end up leaving feeling like you at least ate something tasted great. I've yet to comment on the general staff here. They're all very busy (at least the times I've been in). You never just see the staff sitting around and relaxing. They are always moving table to table, and going in and out of the kitchen. I would absolutely love to catch this place on a day and time where they aren't that busy to try to gauge the food and wait time on an average day, but I can't make it out to this location during that day/time."
Marian J.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,25,,3.0,9/9/2017,It is way too cold. Feels like the thermostat is set at 60 degrees!  Needed to wear a jacket inside although it was 110 degrees outside recently.  Makes it an unpleasant dining experience.  Otherwise love the food and cheesecake.
Stephanie S.,"Sacramento, CA",211,201,772,4.0,1/6/2016,Cheesecake Factory is probably one of my favorite restaurants. It never fails me. I usually get the Steak Diane or the the lunch special that comes with soup/salad/sandwich. They also have the best calamari and hot wings. So if you're a fan of either of those you've got to try it at Cheesecake Factory. There are also a few other pasta dishes that we really enjoy but don't remember the name of it.
Shay W.,"Upland, CA",9,29,8,2.0,7/23/2016,"Single diner, bar table. Someone supposedly went to get bread and butter, however it never came. I noticed every other table had bread so its a little concerning with the number of employees walking past and not noticing anything different about my table.  Miso Salmon-lunch portion was ok; the sauce was not quite the consistency I'm used to. Salmon was  good, but not great. I've ordered this dish about 100 times at various Cheesecake Factory restaurants throughout California so I know when it's done perfect.  Service was slow....for pretty much everything. Would I dine here again if in the area? Probably not."
Mariah M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,21,,1.0,11/24/2017,"Coworkers and I decided to order curbside on 11/21/2017. We ordered 3 lunch items and 2 dulce cheesecakes. The runner Nancy brought our food out and tipped $5.00 big mistake. Get back to the office to notice that the cheesecakes were missing. So I called and spoke to a Nora, I advised on what happened and requested to be credited for the cheesecakes but would be coming right back to get them. Due to the inconvenience, traffic etc. Nora accommodated my request. My coworkers and I go back and went inside. We experienced the RUDEST HOST BY THE NAME OF FRENCHY (male). If looks could kill that's how he treated us. We kindly asked for Nora he asked were they seated I said I'm sorry Nora the manager he said we don't have a manager by that name. I said I just talked to her! Another hostess said she'll go get her, in the meantime Frenchy said RUDELY STEP TO THE LEFT while throwing attitude and dirty looks!! Frenchy needs an attitude adjustment and needs to be trained on how to appropriately be a friendly and caring host!!!  Needless to say I will never be going back and I will definitely be networking my experience!!"
Fem C.,"Stockton, CA",139,7,31,4.0,4/17/2017,"Anytime I come here, place is always busy. But you gotta love their food and pies. Menus change from time to time. But their food is always good. My family ordered different things to taste. Server was very accomodating esp when we asked if we can move to a booth since we had our little baby. When you are here, you gotta have at least one of there delicious pies."
Stephen D.,"Sacramento, CA",0,20,2,5.0,4/16/2017,Catherine gave us outstanding service last night. She refilled our drinks right when we needed her.  Recommended two excellent dinners.  Brought us refills of bread. Checked in with us at just the right times.  Boxed our leftovers and put foil around our bread.  She was pleasant and professional.  Giving you a $10 dollar tip was the easiest decision of my night.  Thank you for the excellent service Catherine.
Alexis C.,"Fair Oaks, CA",184,27,36,3.0,1/2/2016,K so I usually LOVE Cheesecake Factory big menu and lots of cheesecake. This time there was a hair in our food and the waiter got irritated that we said something..our cheesecake was like falling over which of course it still tasted yummy as usual but I feel like presentation is kinda part too. It was super busy people kept bumping into U.S. While we were waiting and we were sat at a tiny 2 top where our conversations were overlapping with the tables on each side of us so we couldn't have any hard core convo.  Of course I'm sure I'll go back ...it's just this experience wasn't very good.
Cathi B.,"Sacramento, CA",15,32,9,5.0,4/1/2017,"Haven't been here for many years.  The food was great,  service was terrific and it is very reasonably priced.  If you like Caesar salad, get the appetizer sized.  Its huge and I couldn't finish it!! I would appreciate people who review restaurants to take the time to explain why they thought the soup too runny. Amanda was our server and she was awesome!  We're leaving here full and happy!!"
Viktor S.,"Roseville, CA",0,2,,1.0,5/20/2017,"Really bad service at night time, cheating on money and acting like it's all ok, meat was not ready for eat, I'm not recommended visit at night time this place, especially on arden"
Lance A.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",57,52,95,4.0,3/29/2015,"Always good warm bread with butter, i prefer the honey wheat over the sourdough.  I had the Louisiana Chicken Pasta - bow tie pasta in a spicy sauce with mushrooms and bell pepper. Chicken is a breaded and fried piece, very satisfying for a lunch portion (before 5pm).  Mrs had the Chicken Picata, tender chicken sautéed in a creamy lemony sauce with angel hair pasta, very delicate and delicious. Also a lunch portion, we left well fed! With so much on the menu it's hard to decide.... pictures would definitely help me decide. That beings said, I usually have a pretty consistent decent experience here."
Dan W.,"Chico, CA",0,8,,1.0,5/17/2017,Incompetent staff can't even manage to get all the toppings on my to-go salad. I guess my bad for not checking...although that's their job. Will never eat here again since they can't get even a simple task correct.
Jennifer C.,"Davis, CA",57,157,27,3.0,7/5/2016,"Food was good, but nothing special.  Standard chain fare.  The cheesecake was delicious, because: cheesecake.  Rather expensive for what they are offering."
Ashley K.,"San Bruno, CA",63,60,47,5.0,3/12/2016,"I'm a cheesecake factory fan, that is for sure.  In my opinion it is hands down the best chain restaurant there is.  If you want to have a great experience like I do,  here's what you need to order: Appetizers:  Avocado egg rolls! So damn good. The sauce they come with is delicious. Fried macaroni and cheese balls. I know,  I know.  It sounds like a heart attack on a plate.  My mouth has never loved something so much.  Every friend I've brought to cheesecake has tried them and you can watch the smile come across their face as the taste hits them.  General concensus : ""damn!"" Served on some marinara,  too good to be true.  Lunch / Dinner: Herb crusted salmon. Freaking delicioisness.  Comes atop some creamy, lemony sauce that's out of this world, with asparagus and mashed potatoes. I always mean to ask for extra sauce but I never remember.  Put that stuff on everything...it's good! Their soups change daily so when you hear the server say ""baked potato soup"" you say ""yes please!"" Creamy, cheesy, bacony...seriously incredible. Drink: Asian pear martini!! It's made with real pear puree so you'll get the yummy graininess of eating a fresh pear. My man gets them too because they're just that damn good. Cheesecake: all of them.  My personal faves are white chocolate raspberry, peanut butter cup, and the sinfully rich Godiva chocolate that comes with fresh whipped cream and a square of Godiva dark chocolate on top. Get it with cofee. Or if you're feeling fun, Irish coffee. I'm usually feeling fun!  If you're too full after the meal to eat cheesecake, get a slice to-go. I mean,  come on...that's what they're famous for."
Carly K.,"Sacramento, CA",0,2,,3.0,9/10/2017,We come here all the time and get the same pasta (spicy chipotle pasta) every time. This is my second time ordering to go and I thought the first time may have been just a mess up but now that this is the second I feel they do not care about their to go customers. When we eat there the pasta is FANTASTIC. And when it's to go there is NO sauce it is very dry plain noodles and the noodles aren't even cooked all the way..
Joann P.,"Sacramento, CA",479,369,2286,4.0,10/7/2015,"Decided to come here for dinner rather than Firestone. Less busy and they give you complimentary bread. Ordered the jambalaya and my friend had the Hibachi steak. Food did take long, but it was worth the wait. My friend's steak was so good. My jambalaya wasn't bad either."
