Kevin S.,"Sacramento, CA",8,18,29,4.0,10/7/2017,"Can't go wrong with this place been coming here for years. Food was good, customer service ok but he had all of our section to himself which he handle like a champion."
Poonam S.,"Sacramento, CA",36,10,24,5.0,1/31/2017,"Been to this location several times and always a pleasant experience. Sooooo many options to choose...from the appetizers, entrees, deserts, to the drinks. My personal favorite is the Chicken Bellagio...yum! Portions are huge so unless you're really hungry you can take the leftovers for lunch/dinner for the next day :)"
Dax P.,"Woodland, CA",108,108,175,5.0,10/4/2016,"I love coming to this Cheesecake Factory. Service is always great,  but on this day,  it was outstanding. We came early before the evening rush to celebrate a birthday. I ordered one of my favs,  Chicken Bellagio. It was perfect and as expected. I normally lick the plate clean,  but today I left a few morsels on my plate only because I two fisted the bread and butter before dinner. Not to mention a glass of passion iced tea to expand the dough in my belly. Appetizers and munching bread will always ruin your dinner. But I never learn... Oh well. Our waiter was on his game.  Very attentive and made sure our visit was perfect. I enjoy it here and so will you."
Alan N.,"Vacaville, CA",0,53,,5.0,12/7/2017,I have always wanted to eat at The Cheesecake Factory no matter where the location is at.  The place is always crowded and me not wanting to wait always left and went somewhere else to eat.  Two months ago we happened to be in the area and decided to eat at this location.  Perfect.  No lines.  This was about 4:30 in the afternoon.  Obviously I was estatic.  No waiting.  Needless to say we have been to this location several times and it has always been little waiting.   Service has always been outstanding the the food very delicious.
Ginny L.,"South San Francisco, CA",161,6,2,1.0,6/12/2017,"I've always remembered Cheesecake Factory for their good food and good customer service but for my experience, this one had neither.  First off, our waiter was kinda cold if I may say. He asked what drinks he could get for us and looked quite impatient while my boyfriend was looking through the menu since we had just sat down. He ended up just getting a water since he noticed that the waiter looked irritated. He then came back and mumbled ""can I start you guys off with some bread and butter?"" I could barely hear what he said and my boyfriend couldn't hear at all and it's not like it was extra loud in there.  Food wise, my boyfriend got the steak Diane and said it was pretty good. I got what I always get: Louisiana chicken pasta. However, mine didn't have much flavor and it was really oily. At other locations, they always come with the block of Parmesan cheese right when they bring me my plate of pasta but this one didn't. It didn't bother me much until it took me over 5 mins to flag down a waiter/waitress for some cheese (we were sitting in an area where waiters and waitresses were coming and going so 5 mins was kinda pushing it). Food did come fast but our appetizer came like 10 mins after our main courses and what we had ordered was literally grilled cheese with a piece a bacon so idk why it took so long lol.  As for service the rest of the night, we never saw our waiter again. It wasn't even him who brought us our food. No one came by to ask how we were doing. We had to wait over 20 mins just to ask for boxes for our food and for the check. However, the lady who did help us at the end with the boxes and check seemed pretty friendly and was the type of customer service I was used to seeing at a Cheesecake Factory.  We tipped really little (didn't even want to tip tbh) and that's coming from people who always tip, even at little snack and drink places.  Tldr; love Cheesecake Factory, just not this one. Will prob not be coming back"
Shannen C.,"Sacramento, CA",271,467,4006,3.0,3/24/2016,"Came here for friends birthday on a Wednesday night. Our dinner party was about 12 people so we waited about 45 minutes until we were seated. In the meantime, we enjoyed some drinks at the bar. I ordered the passion fruit margarita, it was tasty but really sweet. For $13 a cocktail, I would hope for more alcohol.  After finally being seated, the service was okay. There was long periods of time where our server was not to be found. We asked for bread 3 times and finally received a refill. This was also after our good has arrived. I ordered the steak Diane, it was okay. I ask for a medium rare the temperature on the steak was all different. Since some pieces were thicker than others so some pieces were well done, some pieces of medium rare. We spent $120 between for our 2 person tab for drinks, entrees and cheese cheesecake to take home. Overpriced for mediocre food and service.  The cheese cake is probably the only thing that was worth the cost at the cheese cake factory."
Barbara E.,"Sacramento, CA",25,7,8,4.0,5/16/2017,"We had a group of 4 on Mothers Day ,only a 15 min wait.I truly expected longer ,but excitedly wait less than 15 mins..our food was all great I had Asian lettuce wraps and my favorite I get everywhere I can sweet potatoes..They were not as good as I was expecting,but I can't turn them down,my Asian Chicken lettuce wraps ,well I couldn't of asked for any better,loved them..my boyfriend got Jambalaya ,he loved it as well.daughter in law got salmon  and veggies,it smelled so good .my son got a chicken sandwich with sweet potatoes..they forgot his sweet potatoes ,I did ask several times for them ,finally came out when he had finished half of his sandwich,I didn't understand all of our food being ready and him waiting forever on sweet potatoes.

The Carmel was dripping,they totally enjoyed.I will be back one of these days for more cheesecake!"
Allyanna P.,"American Canyon, CA",0,7,,2.0,6/21/2017,"I usually have a pretty decent experience here but this past weekend, there was some type of mix up with a reservation I made a month ago. The manager was very rude to my parents and talked down to them as if they couldn't understand anything. The manager also snapped at me and told me that they were completely full and that she couldn't just tell folks who were seated that they need to leave (I never asked her to do that).  Just beware of the rude management here."
Ro R.,"Reynoldsburg, OH",0,15,2,1.0,5/14/2017,This location is not the cleanest. I ordered shepherds pie and it had a few black beans in it which means they are not usually not in this mix. I got to my fruit cup and found broccoli at the bottom! Didn't know that was part of the fruit cup!
Lysa D.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",33,274,89,4.0,8/15/2016,"Good service and good food. The bad part? We found some piece of hard paper that might have been cooked along with the parmesean garlic bread. The bread was good until we got that piece. The waiter said he would take it off our bill and when the bill came, it was still on there so we had to mention it to him again. We also ordered the chicken and steak diane which was DELISH. Just not a fan of ordering food and getting something else on the plate. I do love cheesecake factory tho so I'm sure I'll be back, and will be inspecting my food more thoroughly."
Jessica G.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,7,1,2.0,6/11/2017,"The food here was alright, our service was horrible. First time in my life that I did not leave a tip... I felt like our waiter, Brett, was more concerned with the table next to us he did not care much about our table. It is not hard to turn your head and make sure that the table behind you is doing okay also. I even went and got cheesecake to go because he dropped off our dessert menus and went on break. Great, go on break but send someone over in the next few minutes and not within enough time for others to go and get their own to go cheesecake."
Jasmine G.,"Antioch, CA",1,15,12,1.0,3/6/2017,To guest services comment- No worries. There is no excuse you can send that will fix the fact that you guys have  horrible customer service. Everything worked out for the best for my party we took our business somewhere in which it was greatly appreciated(we did not have one problem there) We enjoyed ourselves way more than we could at your place of business (Thanks Joe's Crab Shack!) Just a tip though you guys should be more specific on the page when you say you take reservations (because that obviously was a lie) wish you the best. Thanks.
Tricia F.,"Sacramento, CA",138,353,1078,2.0,12/13/2015,"Ate here with a co worker the other night. I ordered the Avocado Eggrolls and Edamame ~ both were delicious. The tamarind-cashew dipping sauce for the Avocado Eggrolls is amazing. The perfect blend of tangy and sweet. Yum! These Avocado Eggrolls were so good I decided to order a take out order for the hubster and included an order of their Chicken Samosas (one of his favorites). Our waitress brought the already bagged take out order to the table. When I got home I was SO not happy. The Avocado Eggrolls were smaller than the ones I enjoyed fresh at the restaurant; they also looked like they had been sitting for hours! When I combined both (very small) take out orders together in one take out container, I still had room.  Note to self: NEVER order take out from The Cheesecake Factory ALWAYS order fresh and ask for a box."
Lorna C.,"San Diego, CA",49,117,41,4.0,8/25/2017,The food is good and reliable. We usually come here before going to the drive-in movies. The takeout experience is usually pretty good. They always give us extra utensils and sauces. I've never had a bad server so far. My stars are based on quality over price. I feel like you get a decent meal for the cost. My favorite item on the menu is the Divinci pasta. I order it with angel hair noodles. We also like the buffalo blasts and the chicken marsala. And of course the cheesecake is amazing! I think out of the other cheesecake factories this is one of my favorite lines as well as the one in San Francisco. I ate at one at the Grove in LA and it was not good.
Crystal J.,"Sacramento, CA",96,108,418,5.0,9/25/2016,"This review is just based on the walk up bakery for buying cheesecake. Typically we come for dinner and then order dessert, however yesterday all we wanted was some cheesecake to go. We arrived to a good amount of people waiting for tables however we were able to order right away. The attendant was very nice and helpful when it came to making a decision on flavor. We ended up with a lemon meringue and salted caramel. Both selections were delicious!"
Sandy J.,"Roseville, CA",25,166,619,2.0,12/21/2015,"Okay... if you really like to eat your food in a very dark restaurant, this is for you. So dark and gloomy, we needed our phones on, just to see each other. My meal was good, had The Chicken with mash & green beans. My friend had Chicken Masala which was not good at all. He mentioned it to the waiter, and nothing was really done.  We asked for specific requirements but it wasn't accomodated.  Our waiter Oscar came to our table every once in a while. But when the bill was due, three waiters', kept coming by.   Could have been better since our bill was 100.00, but I don't think we'll be returning anytime soon."
Krish L.,"Sacramento, CA",0,12,42,4.0,5/28/2017,"The service is fast and friendly (we went on a  Sunday for lunch), large portions except for the cheesecakes slice that was a little bit of small compare to the Bay Area branch. But overall the service and ambiance is satisfactory. I would definitely come back here."
Angela S.,"Sacramento, CA",0,19,1,1.0,11/24/2017,Very rude staff. The are overrated and staffed poorly. It seems like they cater to only certain types of people
Emily C.,"Lodi, CA",0,9,,1.0,11/22/2017,"Came here for my birthday dinner and was super excited. Until it literally took 2 hours to get my food after me and my table ordered :( TWO hours... we were really nice about it, and our waitress kept saying our food was on its way. Every table around us was talked to about discounts and gave free dessert. We didn't want to complain, but nobody did anything for me and my family. Super disappointed. And on top of it, they brought me the wrong food. I didn't have them take it back because I didn't want it to take longer for the rest of my group. Overall, after all the years I've been coming here I won't be back. Good food, extremely bad service."
Crazzzy T.,"Sacramento, CA",15,102,444,5.0,3/18/2017,My 1st time coming. Had lunch. Steak Diane & shrimp scampi with green beans. Food was delicious. Sat on the patio on a nice spring day. Nicole S. was my waitress and was very sweet and attentive. Good food. Good service.
