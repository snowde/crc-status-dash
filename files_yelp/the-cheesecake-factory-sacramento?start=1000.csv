JonCasey I.,"Fairfield, CA",155,39,24,5.0,1/18/2010,Service here was great we had a party of 12 but the wait was only 30 mins. The waiter was vey kind and had a great memory with our orders. The food was great I had the garlic noodles w/ chicken which I split between me and my girlfrield it was delicious. The cheesecake was also very good the only down side is all the calories I put down with for the whole meal. I had a great time the waiter was even nice enough to split the check between 12 people. Loved it great experience
Brianna P.,"Anchorage, AK",20,38,130,5.0,3/2/2010,Great food!! Huge Portions.. and always 1000 things to choose from! Must try there Strawberry lemonade.. Cheese cake 100% always hits the spot and never disappoints. Love cheesecake factory :-) Personal Favorites: Steak Diane/ Farfalle W. Chicken and Roasted Garlic/ Chris's Outrageous Cheese Cake... Happy Eating!!
Jackson J.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,8,1,1.0,7/4/2013,your food gave me and my girlfriend food poisoning!!! i called to complain some gal named terrisa answered and told me i would be called back and i never was!!! 70 bucks for an overcrowded restaurant that doesn't take resuravtions for small party's and a ruined evening of vomit from food poisoning!!!!
Janay I.,"Denton, TX",5,40,12,4.0,10/18/2010,"Service was great, my bang-bang chicken and shrimp was awesome but the Seared Ahi was just too fishy for me and really expensive of course.  I love this place though!  I spent $77 for two meals and two pieces of cheesecake."
Stan Z.,"Sacramento, CA",89,12,7,4.0,9/3/2010,"Love Cheesecake Factory!  Service is good, food is good, ambiance is not bad either.  I always order the Louisiana Chicken Pasta, so delicious!  Reasonable price for decent size portions.  Remember to order a slice of cheesecake...good stuff!  Would definitely recommend to others."
Cathy Y.,"Sacramento, CA",0,12,,5.0,4/30/2013,Staff was great and the food was fantastic. I love to come here with my husband just for a night of relaxing and eating and when we want to do a little catching up. He's always busy so coming here and just ordering my usual salad and him with his pasta plate. We get to chit chat and laugh and just joke around. The site of this place at night is amazing.
Stacey C.,"Citrus Heights, CA",110,110,34,2.0,1/18/2010,"I don't normally eat at Cheesecake Factory, as they don't take reservations and I don't like places where you have to wait for a freakin pager to let you know when you can eat.  But, I received a gift card from my managers for Christmas to eat here.  Also my husband told me he'd never been to a Cheesecake Factory, so I told him we'd go.  Being a group of 2, we only had to wait 20 minutes so I guess we were fortunate especially considering it was 6pm on a Saturday night, yet the 20 minutes were filled with constant pushing, shoving, relocating, no place to stand and general discomfort.  After we were seated the service for the rest of the night was actually really good.  Our Server was nice, smiled, had a personality and we never had to ask for anything.  He had everything ready for us. Plus the dinner was actually decent.  My husband got the grilled flatiron steak and I had the Steak Diane.  Both were cooked perfectly and tasted pretty good.  Portions were generous too.  Now..the bad parts...I felt like everything I was eating off of was dirty.  2 of my 4 utensils actually had food crusted on them which just made me shudder. My other 2 utensils were so spotted from the dishwasher it looked like they were dirty as well.  When my dinner came, the plate had stuff crusted under the rim.  I figured maybe it happened when my food was being plated?? Anyhow, it was just so gross...and I didn't feel like I could ask for any more replacements as I had already had my silverware replaced.  Plus the table looked like it had food residue on it from prior customers, but in the low light and being that everything else with the exception of my wine glass had been dirty...I could have imagined the dirty table part.  Lastly, the cheesecake was very mediocre.  We ordered the classic cherry cheesecake to share.  It came with a MOUNTAIN of whipped cream on top it and another MOUNTAIN on the plate. Really??? Do we need 2 cups of whipped cream with the cheesecake? So overdone it just ruined it.  Plus the crust was super wimpy..barely could tell there was a crust it was so thin.  I like a cheesecake with a graham cracker crust that you actually have to cut through with your fork.  This crust was more akin to a crumb topping at the bottom of the cake pan.  The cake filling of sour cream was ok, not great.  The cherry topping could have come straight out of a can..certainly didn't have the authentic feel of a place that's been making cheesecake for like 50 years."
Alison N.,"San Francisco, CA",250,245,15,4.0,3/13/2008,"Seriously, the first time going to The Cheesecake Factory...and in Sacramento...? What's wrong with me? HAHA. I don't know, it was good!!  I got the chicken with some pasta. OMGG. The portions were HUGEEE. Insane. But my chicken and pasta were both excellent!  For dessert, the vanilla bean cheesecake is to diee for. I wanted the banana cream one, but they were out. Ahh, next time. Would go again, for sure.  Minus 1 star: For crowded waiting area (wait wasn't HORRIBLE though), running out of my cheesecake, and the high price...."
Capsicum A.,"El Dorado Hills, CA",0,23,34,4.0,7/20/2008,"Pros: great food, good-size portions, delicious cheasecakes, efficient service. Cons: overpriced, crowded during dinner hours and it's very cold inside."
David H.,"Redding, CA",17,9,4,5.0,11/8/2010,Had a great time on the patio.  Huge heaters kept it warm without detracting from the atmosphere of dinner.
Layle S.,"Sacramento, CA",0,3,,2.0,1/17/2010,"One time I had a pasta dish call Evelyn's Favorite, I think it was about $13 or $14, the pasta wasn't fully cooked, it was al dente, as well as my friends' pasta dishes. Although the dish itself was good, there was also lots of oil in it, my friends' dishes had lots of oil in it too. Another time I ordered the chicken madeira and shimp scampi combo for $19.99. The food was very tasty, but the portion was very small. The mashed potatoes were very very salty, almost seemed like it was by mistake. I was not full after the meal. I think only pasta dishes get big portions. The cheesecakes are quite pricey, about $7 and up for a piece."
Denise M.,"South San Francisco, CA",202,1022,8,4.0,4/24/2008,"Came here with a friend/coworker during a business trip.  The interior is exactly identical to any other Cheesecake Factory.  Menu is also identical.   The food, still delicious.  We shared a fabulously crispy fried calamari.  I'm not sure what the ""white"" dipping sauce was, but it was very garlicy - so good!  I had my old faithful herb crusted salmon with a creamy lemon sauce.  My friend had the chicken marsala.  Both of us were too full to have any cheesecake unfortunately. It's nice to know that I can get the same quality of food at any of the locations of this chain restaurant."
Mike G.,"Yuba City, CA",222,21,1,4.0,2/18/2010,Overall this restaurant is amazing.  All the food is delicious and the cheesecake is amazing.  best thing to do is eat all your food then get your desert to go and eat it at home.  The only bad thing is it is so crowded and does not take reservations.  The menu is huge and has such a variety of food.
Christopher M.,"Sacramento, CA",38,47,13,5.0,8/31/2007,"I am a major fan of the cheesecake factory. i love the huge menu, as well as the huge platters. I have been here numerous times, and I have never had a bad experience. I think i have tried almost everything on the menu, as well as all the drinks. If you are loking for a good non-alchohalic drink, go with the Mango smoothie. It is heaven, im like, ""thank god for the mexican who picked these mangos and strawberries"". here are my fav's:  Orange Chicken  Ice cream mudpie  Guacamole Eggrolls  I garauntee you will love this place, just rember its a lil pricey!"
Benjamin D.,"Sacramento, CA",1,14,,4.0,2/7/2011,I enjoy cheesecake factory because the service and food is always consistent. 90% of the dishes are always good and large portions allow for sharing and or leftovers. Staple chain restaurant.
Kristine D.,"Fairfield, CA",61,340,159,4.0,3/12/2012,good food. very loud. too close together. very expensive. come here when you have a lot of money to spend.
Jacob S.,"Sacramento, CA",37,12,,2.0,11/11/2010,"Ive heard about this place before, and i should have known. If you go to a place with the name ""cheesecake factory"" you shouldnt expect much. So we tried it anyway, it wasnt that great. My girlfriend got the shepards pie and I got a pasta dish. They were bland and not plated very well. We also got a avacado egg roll app, which was ok, ive had better. This will probably be our only visit."
Jenny P.,"Sacramento, CA",4,23,,4.0,10/28/2012,I love this place!  Good food very reasonable price.  Service are very nice .  The only things is long waiting for the table.  Their cheese cakes is awesome!!! Yummy !  I recommend their godiva cheesecake!!!  The food here they give you such a big portion.   My son love their bang bang chicken .
Ivy R.,"Benicia, CA",81,79,15,5.0,4/26/2009,"Last minute dessert at 9pm.  We knew the Cheesecake Factory was open, however we had been unsuccessfully looking for Coldstone.  I was afraid we were dressed too casually for the Cheesecake Facory, but none of the staff gave us that impression.  We were seated quickly, and our server did a great job.  He didn't hover and wasn't gone on long absences.  His timing was perfect.  My friend and I both ordered a mini-appetizer and shared them.  We each had a slice of the reason for being there, and all of the food made me think we died and went to heaven!  I would make the hour drive again!  Oh, and how could I forget the beautiful decorations??"
Sam S.,"Sacramento, CA",1,106,,3.0,12/21/2012,Went there for lunch to celebrate a family member's birthday. The place was crowded and it was really noisy. There was a long wait for our food after we ordered. The food was ok and the portions were large.  The waiter was friendly. It wasn't my choice to go there but the birthday girl liked it so that's all that matters.
