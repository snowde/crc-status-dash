Rebecca H.,"San Francisco, CA",222,482,,3.0,2/1/2007,"Holy mother of god people there are other places to eat in Sacramento!! Of course, I'm being totally hypocritical since I eat here when I go to Sac. Really though, I could branch out and this restaurant has some of the worst wait times that I have ever encountered (worse than locations of the same restaurant). When we tried to change our party from 6 to 7 people, we were told the wait time went from 1 1/2 to 4 hours! Yes the cheesecake is good, but it's not good enough to wait 4 freaking hours. If you actually manage to get a table be sure to get some cheesecake and if you can't eat it then, take a slice home. It actually keeps really well in the fridge."
Nikki c.,"Oakland, CA",338,1040,,3.0,1/24/2010,"The great thing about the suburbs is there's rarely a long wait for a table!  I've gone here for work lunches and they're good about splitting the checks so we can all do our expense reports.  The staff could work on being less intrusive when you're in the middle of a conversation, but we still had fun."
Matt D.,"Chicago, IL",6,43,,3.0,9/24/2009,"Plus: -Cheesecakes are great. You can't really go wrong ordering one of them. My favorite is the chocolate chip cookie dough. Anything with chocolate is a yes! -Great environment. Clean, nice bathrooms.  Minus: -Prices. -Service. The waiter didn't deliver our coffees until more than half way through the meal. He got confused when we asked for lemons in our waters. Last time I checked that was an elementary task.  -Noise. It's super loud in here, but that's a given in any Cheesecake Factory."
Junior D.,"Sacramento, CA",57,115,22,3.0,2/13/2007,"I was soon to talk about the famous Cheesecake Factory someday.  So here I am, wailing about how ""wow"" this place is.  Dimmed lights, great desserts, and who can help but gawk at the overly advertised menu for upper class folk.  Anyway, it's oh, but a sad thing to see this place so busy on the weekends, including Friday, and of course at night, because you'll never even get seated until 13928402938402398430298 hours later.  So, do plan, to stand around and chat up a storm with your friends, or with yourself on the phone if you plan to stag it up. The food is, EH.  I can care less about this place because there's way better food at different places for lower prices.  It's the A word again folks: AMBIANCE.  EFF the AMBIANCE.  I hate that crap.  I go to a restaurant to eat.  OK, so sometimes, the AMBIANCE is a factor, but, it just irks me sometimes (PF CHANGS anyone?).  I go here for birthday occasions, so, thank god, I don't go here on a normal basis.  Okay, the food, I totally forgot.  I order the Buffalo Wings, and Calamari if I'm not feeling the big meal.  Yes, how not original, but hey what can you do?  If I were to order big, I'd chow down on some of their pastas.  They're, EH, so, it's like what ever to me. NEVER, ever order from this bar.  $9 a shot?  You got to be kidding me.  Happy HR, somewhere else please?  Can I get a cheaper LC somewhere else?  W T H.   Happy eats.  Cheesecake, a 2.5, but 3 under yelp RULES.  haha."
Esther S.,"Sacramento, CA",132,72,16,2.0,1/17/2012,"ok for ALWAYS  being packed i expected better. the decor is confusing, im not sure if its a family place or dinner/date scene. seems to be both. (crying babies). my chicken Marsala was gross, not alot of sauce and chicken was of VERY poor quality. I hated paying for it. the appetizer was pretty good. we went with avocado egg roll. the staff was very nice, and the place is clean. the lighting is in my opinion poor for a late night dinner, its like smoke screen. not my favorite."
Chieko H.,"San Francisco, CA",43,184,3,3.0,9/28/2006,"A great place to lounge with old friends to catch up. If you can get outdoor seating, do it if the weather permits.  I went here with some old coworkers and we ended up talking and drinking until closing! 8-12, and the waitress was so accomodating! Their fried avocado appetizer is good, but a little oily. Thier entres arent too great; but the cheesecakes make up for it! get the pumpkin cheesecake during thanksgiving season!"
Robin T.,"Sacramento, CA",23,94,,3.0,10/2/2007,"Usually chain restaurants with extensive, varied menus spell disaster!  The Cheesecake Factory is an exception.  Pros:  The food is fresh and tasty, the portions are huge and reasonably priced, service is excellent.  The menu is not exceptionally sophisticated but there is something for everyone.  The perfect place for a large group to meet and be assured that everyone will be satisfied.  Their signature cheesecakes are decadently delicious, and I'm a big fan of their appetizers, especially the Thai Lettuce Wraps.  The appetizers are large enough to make a meal out of. Cons:  The wait is ridiculous.  No reservations taken.  Boo.  The interior of the restaurant is very hard so sound gets amplified and it's difficult to hear the person across your table.  The portions may be TOO huge... an exercise in gluttony.  I always try to exercise some self control and take half of my meal home.  Lighting is a bit too dim - I sometimes have a hard time reading my menu."
J P.,"Spring Creek, NV",1,23,,4.0,10/14/2012,I always love coming here when I am in the area.  The drinks are great and the lettuce wraps are awesome!  The staff is always kind and courteous.
Inigo M.,"San Francisco, CA",35,2400,69,4.0,3/14/2006,"Great quality food. Great selection. Good value (generous portions, reasonable price). Staff is generally friendly and responsive. But prepare for long waits at peak times (usually Friday night).  Try the chicken + shrimp + thai curry. It will stop your heart. Eventually."
Charlie O.,"Waukon, IA",776,1198,210,5.0,12/22/2008,"What's not to love about the Cheesecake Factory??? I especially love their ribs, soooo good, tender, falling of the bone tender. Everything I have had to eat here has been perfect. The drinks are great. Now for the cheesecake itself. What can I say?? Nuff said."
sofia m.,"Sacramento, CA",1,12,,1.0,6/11/2011,"The service was bad, the waiter brought my food and after ten minutes of waiting I had to ask them where my friends food was. On top of that half an hour later I had an upset stomach and ended up coming down with food poisoning. It's the next day now and I still feel horrid. They either didn't cook the turkey burger all the way, or my salad wasn't washed properly."
Tina S.,"Sacramento, CA",0,22,,5.0,9/30/2010,I love the cheese cake factory it is my favorite place to go. They have good  food and delicious cheesecake love godiva chocolate cheesecake . YUMMMY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Penelope A.,"Livermore, CA",0,20,1,4.0,8/9/2012,"Love this place! Great service, great food! Always leave this place happy & STUFFED! :)"
Ryan M.,"Pleasanton, CA",9,10,,3.0,3/8/2010,"It's the Cheesecake Factory, true to form.  I've never had a bad experience at any Cheesecake Factory, but I've never been wowed either.  This is a good place to go with large groups since the HUGE menu definitely has something for everyone."
Jennifer C.,"Sacramento, CA",204,88,266,4.0,9/13/2009,"hahah i do love this place... i called the Farfelle Chicken with creamy garlic sauce... it was sooo worth it and soo goood... hahah i took off 1 star because me and my friends had to wait in line for  1 hour, i  think they should do reservations... AND u cant just go to cheesecake factory and not order a slice of cheesecake... i had the Dulce de Leche and it was heavenly... not too sweet and a VERY generous slice.. hahah i would absolutely go back there again!"
B. N.,"Sacramento, CA",14,74,,4.0,8/18/2009,"We got seated immediately for dinner.  The food came quickly.  The portions are huge so I recommend sharing one dish with one or two other people.  Shared a kobe burger with my bf--a little bland.  I recommend the chicken tenders, they come with mash potatoes and a nice corn salad.  That plate was shared by me and three other friends.  We were stuffed.  I also shared a slice of the red velveet cheesecake with my friends.  Damn, it was good.  This is your typical American establishment.  Don't come here if you are looking for fine dining."
Shelly S.,"West Sacramento, CA",0,4,,5.0,6/18/2012,"Excellent customer service by Lindsey at the Arden location.  She was extremely friendly, helpful and patient with my family, even though they were extremely busy!  She made sure our beverages were always full, our order to our satisfaction, and even recommended her personal favorites on the menu.  I went with her recommendation, and absolutely loved it.  We will difinitely will go back to this restaurant and will make sure to request Lindsey as our server.  the food was very good and a huge portion.  So just wanted to say Great job Lindsey keep up the good work!  It's people like you who make me want to frequent your restaurant!  She deserves a raise!"
Jennifer T.,"Sacramento, CA",2,54,4,4.0,9/8/2009,This place is a bit overrated. For the price you pay the food is just okay. I would probably opt out any meals with pasta because every time I order pasta it always comes out dissatisfying. I do like the chicken madeira and the chicken and biscuits though. I give this place 4 stars b/c of their desserts...so scrumptious! They have a large variety of desserts and the cheesecake is one of the best I have had!
Michael B.,"Sacramento, CA",0,12,,4.0,12/22/2010,"This place has a huge menu to choose from. The jumbalaya I ordered was nice and spicy.  Good drink specials, but the main reason i am coming back is for their great cheesecake selection.  You can order it by the slice or take a whole one home."
Timothy J.,"Atlanta, GA",42,45,29,2.0,2/24/2009,I would give this place 1 star if it wasn't for the fact that I love the santa fe chicken salad and the lettuce wraps.  All the other food seems like it's not very good quality and not  very tasty.  I have been here a lot for dinner and tried a lot of entrees but have never been happy.
