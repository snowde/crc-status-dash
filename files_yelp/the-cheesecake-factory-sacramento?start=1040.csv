Ripcurl A.,"Lodi, CA",62,294,46,5.0,4/17/2009,"My holy grail of restaurants.  Who doesn't love the Cheesecake factory, I mean really?  The menu is the size of a phone book and there's something for everyone.  Besides the delicious cheesecake I love the Chicken Madera.  I think the Chicken Madera is one of the most popular dinners on the menu and I could eat it every day."
Jessica R.,"San Francisco, CA",105,371,269,5.0,10/7/2008,"I wasn't really craving to eat a lot but it was my sister's birthday. We went here, it wasn't busy which I loved! We were seated right when we got there!! That's a major plus since I used to live in San Francisco and all the times I went to Cheesecake Factory there, it was always a thirty minute wait since it's in Union Square with a really nice view! Anyway, our waiter was really nice! Plus for him, and he always came by to check up on us. To cut this short, it was good. Mmm, I want some Godiva cheesecake now! :D"
Tiffany P.,"Davis, CA",41,86,3,4.0,1/9/2009,"I picked the Cheesecake Factory for my birthday dinner because I had never been before and figured since it was a chain, it probably catered to most everybody in my party.  I was spot on with my assumptions, but I was also wonderfully surprised by the quality of food.  Everything was cooked very nicely and the portions were more than generous - talk about leftovers!  Also, there is NO WAY you could eat a slice of cheesecake by yourself.  This is definitely a great place to celebrate birthdays, anniversaries, or whatever you like, but they do NOT take reservations, as this is a company policy.  So go early, there's going to be a wait.  We went on a Tuesday night, and the place was packed.  Obviously this restaurant is not suffering from the economic crisis!"
Heidi M.,"Sacramento, CA",0,112,44,4.0,7/10/2011,"I went here last weekend, and was excited to dine here again because it had been a few years since I had been to Cheesecake Factory. Though I skipped the delectable cheesecake itself, Ithe restaurant was just as good as I remembered it. The service was awesome. Our waitress made helpful suggestions on our selections, and brought extra dressing, frequent drink refills, ect.  The food was filling, (large portions), and high quality. My husband ordered a Philly Cheesesteak Sandwich. It was served with a generous portion of fries, a large sandwich filled with lean meat, and a roll that was freshly made. I had a Southwestern Salad. It was outstanding. Unlike some places where you get only a few bites of chicken breast meat throught the salad and mostly greens, this salad was loaded with lean chicken, corn kernals, black beans, avocado, and many other complimentary items. For a salad, it was quite a satisfying meal. The bread basket is even good!! I would recommend Cheesecake Factory to anyone!!"
Rich V.,"Los Angeles, CA",94,41,,4.0,1/27/2009,"ok, so i dont like cheesecake but i went because it was close by and because our other option was panera. we got seated in about 2 seconds, not because the hostess was prompt, but because we felt like sitting down at the nearerst table (we didn't even see the hostess). thats how we roll, son. we order some kind of thai appetizer dish because it was high in protein and i needed energy for the gym that night. i follow it up with the kobe burger, medium. let me tell you something, i've had some pretty good burgers in my day and have even proclaimed Bud's burgers as the ultimate number one. but...i gotta say the kobe burger i had that night may have de-throned buds. but because i love bud's burgers so much i'm willing to go back for a second opinion.  -1 star because i can still taste the nasty omelette i had at this place about 3 years ago."
Jessica H.,"Sacramento, CA",16,25,12,1.0,6/16/2009,"The food is mediocre. The service isn't service. Paying $ to look at advertisements in the menu is bush league. Suggestion, COCO'S is across the street! MiMi's is down the street. WAY BETTER!"
Noelle L.,"Livingston, NJ",0,5,,5.0,1/30/2012,Belated review but service was that impressive I wanted to make sure they got a worthy rating.  9 of us went to Cheesecake around 7 PM on New Years Eve.  Packed of course and the wait for a table that large inside was 1.5 hours unless we wanted to sit outside.  The wonderful manager saw that there were two babies with us and managed to sit us inside within 20 minutes.  What a treat =)
Lucas N.,"Sacramento, CA",21,108,42,3.0,4/16/2009,"I just don't get all the rave about this place. I've been here a couple times and the wait is ridiculously long, but the food isn't really worth waiting for?? Maybe I'm just not ordering the right dishes. =( Then again, I'm not a big fan of cheesecake, so I never order any dessert. I've had the chicken alfredo...and I've definitely had better elsewhere. I can actually make better at home. The fetticine noodles are a bit odd, because they're green, but the sauce wasn't to die for. It was dry and not creamy. I've also had the chicken marsala, and that was actually pretty good. But not good enough to wait an hour and a half for."
A W.,"San Francisco, CA",11,146,7,5.0,12/24/2008,"I had a great experience here on a Monday night. My server Shanell S. was really terrific at every aspect. She was attentive, welcoming, and genuine. I haven't had this good experience for a while so it was refreshing. Food was delivered hot and tasty. Everything was on point."
Sarah S.,"Emeryville, CA",101,358,47,2.0,2/25/2009,"I've been here for dinner a few times. The whole reason to go here is the dessert. Even though the menu is really big and there's a lot to pick from, the food has never been better than okay. You'd be better off at Applebee's or Chili's. The only way to describe it is just average. It's a really nice place with awesome dessert, especially the huge Chris's chocolate cake, but it's really loud with a long wait on weekends. The food is a little overpriced, too."
Robert B.,"Sacramento, CA",294,77,1,2.0,7/10/2008,"If you like eating overpriced cheesecake in a giant casino and looking at plastic surgery ads in your menu, then I guess this is the place for you. The cheesecake wasn't THAT good, and the whipped cream tasted pretty flat and bland. For a slice of this cake, you could get a whole Sara Lee pie and a 6 pack of cheap cold beer, with some left over for ramen.  I think they should redo the bathrooms to that the urinals are shaped like giant cheesecake waterfalls. That would be great.  They refilled my Sprite a few times with a smile, though."
Cy W.,"Sacramento, CA",13,148,64,1.0,3/23/2010,"My mother was given a gift certificate and wanted me to go with her. I felt a bit like a food sociologist going to study how corporate food is delivered. The menu seemed to be a 30 page tome but with all of the left hand pages being ads. While I was trying to ponder their nonsensical menu I was blasted with ads for plastic surgery and credit card application information. In fear that betting all of my tickets on the same horse would net be a disappointing meal I picked 2 small plates. I am glad I did because it ended up one of them I could eat. My mother was in a burger mood. The chilies sounded good on one and the look of disappointment and confusion on her face when it came with a side of pickled jalapenos and not the long pasillas or Anaheim that are familiar to so many of us was a bit startling. It was like a dressed up burger and a cheap ball park hot dog had a love child. I cant say that the stale looking tortilla chips helped. My endive salad was a chopped one.... stems, cores and all. Though heavy on dressing, luckily the stiff body of the chosen lettuces held it up. My ""Pizzaette"" was ordered with mushrooms which the kitchen took to mean not to add more to the mix. I realized this one slice in as my tongue started to tingle, not with delight but with swelling. The waiter promptly took the dish back to confirm of its onion freeness only to be told what I had just learned, Everything is premade and only minimally prepared at the time of serving. It would explain the paltry crust on the pizza. I was too sick for desert (and still later for dinner). Looking over the menu I started to ponder the fridges it would take to hold such a varied menu. It must all just be frozen and sent in then placed on a plate like a beautiful microwave dinner. The waiter and manager were nice at least, but two nice employees does not want to make me return for so-so food."
Trisha H.,"Reno, NV",63,258,16,4.0,6/12/2008,"We drive to Sacramento at lest 2-3 times a year. For shopping and concerts. We discovered the Cheesecake Factory about 2 years ago. We have to eat there every time we are in town. The food is always great, VERY big portions. We got in the habit of ordering the Factory Appetizer Favorites. A must try! And after that you really don't need to order anything else, because it is so huge, it can feed four at least. But we end up order a main meal as well, but usual take it to go. The cheesecake is great, and so are the many other desserts.Go there hungry and be prepared to wait a little before seated, it is always packed. Also parking is sometimes a hassle. Since it is right next to Arden Mall there isn't the much parking."
Linda N.,"San Francisco, CA",124,506,,3.0,12/28/2010,"really long wait for a table considering it was a monday night. cheesecake factory is cheesecake factory no matter where you are. the bread is always tasty and the food is always good. why are the portions here so freakin' huge though? i ordered a ""cup"" of the soup of the day and a small bowl came out...makes me a little scared to see how big the actual bowl is. =P i also had the bbq ranch chicken salad....it was good. but by the time it came out i was already pretty full from the soup. =P service was great. don't know if i would want to come to this location again just because it gets so crowded with everyone that is shopping at arden."
Bill P.,"Placer, CA",0,1,,4.0,10/29/2009,"First visit to the Sacramento Cheesecake Factory.  Great food with health portions. One issue I had was with the bakery, when we left we ordered some cheesecake to go, but were charged sales tax for these items.  I told the clerk that in CA, take out bake goods not eaten on the there are not charged sales tax.  He was unaware of this.  Will be interesting to see if this is corrected on our nextr visit."
D. A.,"Elk Grove, CA",72,131,234,2.0,7/5/2008,"Recommended to Me I am sure this person meant well.  Here's what she highly recommended - Adam's Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple:  Creamy Cheesecake Swirled with Caramel, Peanut Butter, Butterfingers and Reeses Peanut Butter Cups.  The good things that make this Cheesecake a great concept are the Peanut Butter, the Oreo Cookie Crust, the addition of the Reeses Cups and the crushed Butterfingers.  What made it crappy was the Creamy Cheesecake had too much sugar mixed into it.  At this point, I would recommend backing off on the Caramel, too.  ONE star for the Cheesecake. Curbside Delivery To Go Being my first time trying this, I thought it was a great concept that they had a ""To Go"" counter, along with curbside delivery.  The friendly staff over the phone said that all I had to do was call them when I was close by, and they'd go out and look for my car.  Well, THAT was bullshit.  When I arrived, I parked in the marked, Curbside Delivery parking spot, the car was running, the AC was running but NO one came out to the car.  With the car still running, I had to make another cellphone call, and still it still took extra minutes for them to come out.  ""David"" finally came out, took my $7.22 cents for my slice, which I mistakenly told him just to round up to $8.00, and STILL took another 5 minutes before he came out with the change and Cheesecake.  Okay, okay, the staff here are at least friendlier than Rick's Dessert Diner.  I'll give them another star.  But yikes, I paid $8.00 to waste a gallon of gas?   Disease-Cake Factory has had my brown seal of disapproval since 2004 (my first time was in Studio City).  Dammit,  fooled twice!"
Joyce S.,"West Sacramento, CA",121,189,61,3.0,9/10/2008,"Not the first place I'd run to but if I ever had a craving for fried mac n cheese, this would be my number one choice in Sacramento."
Stacy M.,"Modesto, CA",0,20,,5.0,10/25/2011,"This place was definately worth it! The wait wasn't too bad. But we definately beat the crowd. By 6pm the line was out the door. It is noisy in this place. The service was good and everyone was friendly, despite the chaos.  But the FOOD... was So Good! Not just the Cheesecake, which is what we were there for. But the actual food was Delicious!! It was all worth it! I will be going back for sure!"
Anna T.,"South San Francisco, CA",61,39,15,4.0,1/18/2009,"Awesome food, good sized portions, and who doesn't love The Cheesecake Factory?? It's just a bit pricey, but that's why I always split with a friend, I really don't eat that much. Its also conveniently located next to the mall too! So after stuffing yourself silly, you can shop the extra weight off!"
Rosie D.,"Sacramento, CA",64,45,37,1.0,3/20/2009,I have only eaten at the Cheesecake Factory twice. Both experiences have been bad. The staff is good..but the food is horrible. Save your money and cook your own. You will save money and it will taste a lot better than the stuff they serve you at the Cheesecake factory. The cheesecakes aren't that good either!!!
