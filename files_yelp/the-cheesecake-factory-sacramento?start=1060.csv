Cecelia E.,"Chesnee, SC",39,255,249,3.0,5/9/2008,"I visited this location with two out-of-town business guests for lunch.  The wait wasn't bad and we got a good location to sit.  Unfortunately, the two people with me had to wait a very long time to get their iced green tea.  Also, I had to send my salad back because it was missing key ingredients (such as pecans and blue cheese).  This was especially ironic since it was advertised as an endive salad with pecans and blue cheese...."
Jeff L.,"CA, CA",13,78,,3.0,2/10/2007,"Hype.  This is what I think about.  However I do like the building decor.  The food is consumer saturated, it takes food scientists to come up with with the correct blandness so that it doesn't stray away with creativity.  Of course, if this is the taste you're looking for, the factory is for you."
Tracy L.,"Los Angeles, CA",160,91,16,2.0,1/28/2008,"I remember I went there a long time ago and it was hella delicious. But this time it was horrible.  Well I have to admit that I went there on a Saturday night at 7:30ish. The wait was estimated to be 60-80 minutes and it took 15 minutes to get the vibrator waiting thing.  Also I would like to note to people who have to wait a long time is that the vibrator waiting thing deionizes about 5 feet from the door. That means they have to reinstate it once you walk away. So we finally sit down and I order the avocado eggrolls for $9.95. There was six pieces and it was cold and nasty. By the time I got my avocados it was already brown. WTF? Was is someone else's cancelled order or something? The ones at BJs are so much better. I'm so disappointed that it came out this way. Yeah sure it was busy but the Cheesecake factory is always busy. It's like they ran out of heating lamps.   Overall service was average, price is too much, and food well this time it sucked so bad I got a tummy ache."
Hadley H.,"Las Vegas, NV",48,12,,1.0,4/8/2011,"Very disappointed with their lack of customer service and lack of business common sense. I am having heart surgery and 30 of my friends wanted to get together prior to the event. So I called to schedule for a party of 30 on a Tuesday night. The GM Chris Magrall told me they would not do a reservation after 5:30 pm, I said who wants one before? I said so you are telling me you dont want a large group that is going to spend money, he said oh you can come and wait in line and be seated but we cant guarantee you will be together or how long you will have to wait. I have gone there for years and everything is in decline but I liked the environment. In the economic situation we are in, I can not believe they chose to turn away my business. I can tell you I will never go there again. I truly hope they do not survive this economy. They are not accommodating and made no suggestions, so I have had to go elsewhere. I am truly disappointed with the Arden Fair Cheesecake Factory."
S F.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",128,259,271,2.0,11/3/2010,"When i first came to this place about 3 years ago I thought it was great, but now not so much. Here's why, recently a few of us from my office were taken to lunch here, there was a small wait for the table but thats okay. I have been trying to eat better so I decided to get a Cobb Salad, not as many calories as some of the other salads (seriously take a look & you will die looking at all the calories for there food!) when my salad came out my mouth must have dropped to the ground, it looked like they killed my salad by chopping everything up into tiny little pieces and it was just a mountain of junk! It was AWFUL, I try to keep a smile on my face since I was with co-workers but it was the worst salad ever especially for almost $15, YUCK! I will never order that ever again and not sure I will be returning either. Awesome Cheesecake is you want to consume all those calories.......NO THANKS!!!"
Aslan B.,"Fair Oaks, CA",27,115,,3.0,3/8/2007,"Cheesecake at the Cheesecake Factory is very good, and very expensive.  When I have been here, it has been very busy and very noisy.  Seating seemed very smooched together to me but I just need some elbow room.  The menu is extensive all sorts of things to try, I have tried a few of their salad and they were good and had a great selection however I don't make it point to come here and have one on a regular bias.  The portions are so large that I never same room for the actual cheesecake.  I have stopped by to pick up cheesecakes on occasion."
Jeff K.,"La Crescenta, CA",92,485,27,3.0,8/3/2008,"i remember coming here with a few friends for the first time a while back. i ordered this one steak that was said to have been marinated for two days or something like that. oh em gee, it was one of the best steaks i had ever tasted. for dessert, i had the white chocolate macadamia nut and i think i turned into a diabetic after taking one bite. jeezus, it was so friggin sweet.  overall, i think this place is really overrated. however, u gotta admit that this is a good date place since most girls i know are cheesecake fanatics."
Tim L.,"Sacramento, CA",0,8,,5.0,7/1/2011,"Had the cornfritter appetizers made with fresh corn. OMG, I could live on those. Great passion fruit iced tea too. Then had the New Orleans shrimp, creole sauce, not hot, I added tabasco(wish they had Crystal New Orleans hot sauce) with jasmine rice and it was soooo good I had no room for dessert so I took a piece of Apple Carmel Streusel cheesecake home. My friends had the Steak Diane and Kobe Burger and loved them too. Perfect meal."
Tina L.,"San Diego, CA",7,18,9,1.0,10/30/2009,"This is the worst Cheesecake factory SERVICE i ever had. I went in today for my BIRTHDAY with a big party. First off, when the servers were passing out water to everyone one of the waiters spilled water ALL OVER MY TWO FRIENDS. One of my friend's back was all wet. Then, one of the employees came by and said they were going to give them both a free meal. Then, my other friend found a bug in her water. Later on the same employee (not our server) came back and told them that after talking to the manager they cannot give them a free meal but only dessert. My friends complained and said how they don't understand why they would tell us they would give them a free meal and then change their mind. This just shows that they obviously DO NOT communicate within their group or their manager. We then ask to talk to the manager and she came back saying the manager is busy right now and we said we will WAIT for the manager because we were  pretty upset at this moment. Her response? ""The manager is REALLY busy."" UMMM...are you kidding me? We just asked for a manager and you're not going to give us the manager after we told you that we'll WAIT for the manager. In the end, she said that the best she can do is give ONE of my friends a free meal. BOTH of my friends got wet. Thats just not fair. To top of the night our server who was really nice the entire night asked me if I would like a Cheesecake for my birthday. I said I did not want any but she insisted I get one and made it sound like it was a gift from the restaurant itself. So, we get our check and what do you know? I was charged for the Cheesecake. That made me REALLY UPSET! I am so angry at their service and their lack of communication among the staff. I mean, c'mon now...COMMUNICATE with your manager before you go tell customers one thing and then come back and tell them another. Are you kidding me? They need to change their management and improve their service! I may sound really mean but I work in the restaurant business and I am a server myself so I do usually understand but I am really upset at their management here and they definitely need to change it! IF we ask for a manager and tell them we're going to WAIT for one, YOU give us the manager later. I don't care how long we have to wait. Customer service should be priority and they definitely failed at delivering that. OH! & They kept offering Cheesecake Factory shirts after we said no so many times...umm NO! We DO NOT WANT TO ADVERTISE YOUR RESTAURANT AFTER YOUR HORRIBLE SERVICE & COMMUNICATION! DONT COME HERE!!!! Eat at another CHEESECAKE factory!"
Amanda S.,"Sacramento, CA",241,58,9,2.0,12/30/2007,"To me, this place is overrated. The menu is full of ads...weird. If you are at the mall and famished, why not stop by? The miso salmon, the fire roasted artichoke, and the fire cracker appetizer rolls are memorable. However, it's not worth any wait, and there often is one. Simply the epitome of a corporate restaurant, and I'm never a huge fan of that!"
judy l.,"San Francisco, CA",4,114,9,4.0,1/28/2008,"I've been to this location at least 5 or 6 times between last year and the beginning bit of this year.  Cheesecake Factory is a good place to bring anyone because their menu is wide and has lots of variety.  The portions are huge and if you can eat 1 whole dish, you either have a GIGANTIC stomach or you were really really really hungry.  They also have lunch sized portions of some of their dishes if you arrive before 3 or 4pm...I can't remember.   Some people have mentioned they hated the wait....let me tell you, if you have ever EVER EVER been to the Cheesecake Factory in San Francisco on a Friday night, it's like all hell broke loose!!!  Seriously, the wait in the SF location can be anywhere from 1-3 hours just for a small party (on a friday evening), sometimes even having a 1 hr. wait just for the buzzer thing.  There are hoards and hoards of people just standing around waiting and it is so crowded that sometimes it is hard to get onto the elevator.  *sigh* So when I found out of the Cheesecake in Sac, I had to come try it and enjoy some of my favorite dishes.  I believe Cheesecake makes the best calamari I have eaten in my life!   The most recent time, I stopped in on a Friday night around 7:30pm, there was a small crowd waiting on the benches and around the display of cheesecakes, asked for the wait time for 2 and they told me about 15 minutes.  WOOHOO!  just 15 minutes?! Wow, I thought this was fast, but our buzzer went off in just 5 minutes and we were seated right away in a booth.   The service was average, a bit slower than I liked.  However, the quality of food was just about the same compared to other locations (well, I'm assuming they have their own factory of frozen flavored dishes anyway).    I've also been here on a Sat or Sun afternoon and since there was a long wait, we were also offered bar seats but we waited instead and got seat outside in the patio...right next to the heater. I've never had any problems eating at this specific location and think the waitstaff is great.  I will return....to eat some yummy calamari!"
Ben R.,"Sacramento, CA",41,37,1,3.0,10/17/2006,Best Pizza appetizer and you must try their margaritas. But Please do not get their chicken strips.  They were horrible. They were dry and looked nasty.  For the price of $8.95 i believe you can get something better at kfc or Carl's Jr.  Plus their long island is too sugary
Fine D.,"Sacramento, CA",0,19,,3.0,2/18/2008,"Been here a couple times...not bad but, I do think its a little overrated .. prices aren't too bad but the waiting is .. make sure you call ahead if your dining with a group."
Love U.,"San Francisco, CA",2,36,1,5.0,8/15/2007,"I love the Cheesecake Factory!!  They have a huge variety of things to order on their menu and the food is usually very consistent.  My favorites are the crispy chicken sandwich with the chipotle mayo, thai lettuce wraps (yummy), and the luau salad.  The portions are huge so I recommend sharing with someone."
L M.,"Sacramento, CA",31,222,405,5.0,9/23/2010,"love this place. my husband & I love their cheesecake. we only go there to treat ourselves for special occasions when we have a sweet tooth. It is pricey. plan to spend about $50-$60 for two dinner & two cheesecake.  still I love it. Service here is good, but they are quite busy so be prepare to wait. We wanted a booth & waited a while.... people who came after us were seated first & given tables. When it was our turn they had accidentally given us a table too. We informed the waitress we were waiting for a booth and the waitress apologized. We waited a couple more minutes and was given a huge table enough for 6 people. I think they were saving it for large groups but since they made the mistake, they gave it to us. It was nice. Speak up when you're not getting what you want and they will make arrangements. love this place. maybe I'll go again soon."
ann s.,"Sacramento, CA",6,156,74,4.0,6/4/2010,When the fam bam is hungry and we can't decide this is the place to go! The buffalo chicken blast is DELICIOUS! The Shrimp Scampi (5 stars); Shrimp and Chicken Gumbo (4); Herb Crusted Filet os Salmon (3-get something else); Wasabi Crusted Ahi (3); Jambalaya Pasta (2); Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta (3)...the Godiva Cheesecake...made it four stars :) I love that they gave my 2 year old a plate of bananas and bread...cute...not all the waiting staff does this...but they'll bring it out upon request
Its a S.,"Concord, CA",6,46,1,4.0,3/12/2007,Way better than the cheesecake factory in San Francisco! If you show up a little later there is no wait. A tad bit more expensive then the average applebee's (yuck!) but totally worth it. I would recommend the Bikini martini and cajon chicken crispers!
Stacy T.,"Sacramento, CA",0,26,1,4.0,1/5/2009,"I have always had good service here.  The food is good, I especially liked the shepherds pie.  But of course the cheesecake is wonderful."
Silviu N.,"Houston, TX",9,88,5,2.0,7/12/2008,"My wife absolutely hates this place. Average food, poor service and very crowded. Good luck with that belly ache afterward too. You paid top $$ for it."
Davis T.,"Sacramento, CA",28,104,8,4.0,3/2/2006,"Finally Sacramento gets a Cheesecake Factory. First tried it in San Jose and it has awesome food and almost carnival like decor. Prepare to wait on weekends and evenings (30minutes+). Don't expect peace and quiet when dining. The prices are a little upscale but the portions justify the price. The consistency with the food is up to par and quite tasty too. The menu has numerous entress, hamburgers, appetizers, and not to mention their cheesecakes. My favorite of all is their banana cream cheesecake. I still need to try their Sunday brunch though."
