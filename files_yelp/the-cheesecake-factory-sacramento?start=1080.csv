Tobi P.,"Sacramento, CA",53,7,,5.0,11/21/2008,"I love love love the food at Cheesecake Factory.  Their pastas are just absolutely delicious.  Try the Chipotle Chicken Pasta dish and tell me that ain't the yummies thing you ever had.  My hubby's favorite it Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp.  Everytime I take people here everyone comes away raving about their meal.  And the menu is humongous, so there is always something for everyone.   The only problem with that is sometimes it take people a good 10 minutes to get through the menu and decide on something. Enough about the food though.  The atmosphere is dark and loud.  The place can be really really busy, especially on the weekend.  Mind you, the last time I went it was a Friday night and we waited only 10 minutes.  But even if you do have to wait, you can always hop over to Barnes and Noble or Best Buy and shop until your hour is up.   Oh, and I can't forget mentioning the cheesecakes.  Delish!!  The Godiva one is too rich for me, but all the others are wonderful, that is if you're a cheesecake person."
Metallic O.,"San Jose, CA",92,196,310,2.0,1/10/2009,Incredibly long wait for a table. Mediocre food. Bad cheesecake. A waste of my time.
Nancy L.,"Sacramento, CA",219,53,17,4.0,8/29/2007,"i remember when the cheesecake factory first opened in sac... it was pure chaos. Me and a friend decided to go and try it out, we had to wait almost 2 hours for a table. But it was worth the wait. Since my first visit i've been back there many times and even had a birthday dinner there. The food is good and you get a big amount. But after going there so many times i've run outta food to order. There were a few dishes where i wished i never ordered, some of them were just black and look like crap, but some were delicious. The cheesecake is definitely the best. They have the creamiest cheesecake i've ever tasted and they have a big variety of cheesecake. Their other desserts are good too, i had the tiramisu and it was one of the best i ever had... well, maybe 2nd best i ever had. Even if you're full from dinner make sure to get dessert... it's the best part."
Stephanie D.,"Sacramento, CA",14,39,,3.0,8/11/2007,"When I first went to this place I loved it, but it seems as if this Sacramento location has been less enjoyable everytime I've gone since.  The food wasn't very tasty, the service was kinda slow but the thing that bothered me the most was that seating there is terrible.  My friend and I went there for lunch to catch up and chat and it would have been far more enjoyable if there wasn't another table sitting a mere 12 inches from us.  We felt as if we had to keep our voices down (nearly impossible with how loud that place gets) or censor our conversation due to the people who were being forced to hear every word we were saying. If you go, request a table outside, it's not as loud and relatively more private."
Aleenia A.,"Roseville, CA",15,29,17,5.0,9/21/2012,"I absolutely love this place. That's the one restaurant I choose over any other restaurants that I like. They also have valet parking which is soooo  convinient if its busy u dnt need to worry about looking for parking spot. So I go either here or in Rossevile my partner likes that one more. The staff is always nice, professional. Have never had a bad experience in that place. Food is soooo good!!!  I aaaaalways get pasta Carbonara with extra smoked chicken emmmm, or sometimes salmon they do it right way really tasty. I also order sacotach if not really hungry and just came there for light meal. Their dark bread is delicious aaaaaa I want now with salty butter!!!! For desert I like to experiment and get different ones and they all good!!! Lately I have stocked on Godiva Cheescake emmmm, sooo good with Capuchino coffee Orr u can go with tiramisu cake, that is the one place over anyyyy places I have tryed that makes it right moist soooo good and sexy!!!! Thank You Cheescake Factory I am Yours forever!!!!"
jennifer m.,"Sacramento, CA",0,11,3,4.0,4/5/2010,i love the food here... havent crossed by anything i didnt like. i have to get cheesecake everytime i go there. and i love the FREE bread they give you.
Sophan C.,"Sacramento, CA",48,9,,4.0,3/16/2010,I took my fiancee here for our anniversary and it was great! The place is kind of dark because they try to get the ambiance. The wait was about 15-20 mins. The waiting area does not have enough places to sit so almost everyone just stood around awkardly looking at each other. The bar area looks nice and its always full. I had the filet mignon but it comes with fries and onion rings. To substitute with asparagus and mash potatoes they would charge extra? That's ridicolous. I asked for medium rare and it was cooked perfect. The meat just melts in your mouth and did not require any seasoning. It was a good piece of steak. My fiancee had the the angel hair shrimp pasta and she said it's very good. She loves shrimp pasta. The portions are very generous. The price was about average. I thought maybe a little overpriced. The customer service was excellent. Our waitress paid close attention to us even though it was very busy. She was very pleasing. Great time I would go back again for sure. Its one of our favorite place.
Don M.,"Folsom, CA",0,13,,1.0,4/1/2010,"Disappointed that they do not take reservations. Though we were a large group (10), arrived promptly at 5:30. Place was empty but staff made us wait 30 mins for a table. Staff changed waiters on us during the  early course of the meal and caused confusion through out the evening. I ordered Fish Tacos and extra salsa. I think they were out of fish and substituted chicken, though out of a can and completely tasteless. Their idea of salsa is a tablespoon of rough-chopped tomatoes. (also out of a can I think). Eventually I learned that Tabasco was available and helped make a tasteless dish less so. Luckily the beer was drinkable and helped wash down this truly tasteless abomination.  Only reason I went there was because of friend's choice. No plan to return."
k L.,"Sacramento, CA",26,24,47,3.0,6/18/2009,"had the kobe burger and my friend had meatloaf. very big portions..i liked the food, but American food isn't really my fav. also had snickers cheesecake for dessert. everything was really good. the fries that came with the burger are just regular french fries which could have been seasoned more. We came for lunch so it wasn't busy at all on a weekday. The atmosphere was nice and I liked the small booth we were sitting in. Waitress was nice."
S D.,"Sacramento, CA",28,66,,5.0,9/22/2008,"I freaking loooooove this place, I don't understand how anyone could hate on it. First of all, Happy Hour (only on food of course) is AMAZING. I recommend the lettuce wraps, Thai spring rolls, chicken quesidilla, and the avocado egg rolls, all of which are $1.95-$4.95 (and you know what their portions look like). Other items on the H.H. menu include multiple salads, pork sliders, and the infamous fried mac n' cheese balls.  Items on the regular menu that I can't resist are the Kobe burger (ordered rare-med rare, how any cut of Kobe beef should be ordered, duh). Also, the Jamaican black pepper shrimp with black beans and fried plantains is delicious as well. I know people complain about the portion size, but why don't you save a dent in your wallet by sharing an app/entree, this works every time for us. I also love coming here for Sunday Brunch items- My all time fave is the Monte Cristo breakfast style!!!!!! The Brioche bread is already pre-soaked in syrup and dusted with powdered sugar- it is pretty much awesome.  Lastly, one out of about every 5 times I come here, I treat myself to a slice of cheesecake (shared of course, they have roughly 1,000 calories to a slice). I haven't tried that many yet but if you go before the end of October and you feel like splurging on calories, the 30th Anniversary Cheesecake is so delectable. It is 2 layers of the original cheesecake and 2 layers of the fudge cake, topped with a rich doll-op of dark fudge and chocolate pearls... so simple yet delicious!! Service is always great for us at the bar, and there is never a wait!"
tom l.,"Sacramento, CA",0,10,2,3.0,11/4/2009,"good place for occasions or a date. A little pricey. Food is okay, depends of how cook is feeling that moment. The cheesecake is delicious tho. i always order the hibachi steak or any other steak. overall good place to eat occasionally."
Matthew W.,"Sacramento, CA",89,77,34,4.0,11/9/2006,"I wish I could give The Cheesecake factory four and a half stars.  It deserves more than a four, but not necessarily a five.  The Cheesecake Factory is an excellent restaurant.  There is a very nice atmosphere, created by the dim lighting, which also causes a romantic air.  There is very good service as well.  While you are waiting for your meal, they serve you fresh, warm bread in two types.  Just a hint: if you are going to order a main entree, plan on getting about three meals out of it.  Personally, I go for an appetizer, which is one or two meals.  My favorite is the fried macaroni and cheese.  You are served four breaded and fried balls of macaroni and cheese on a chunky marinara.  When you plunge your fork into the ball, you will find lots of white cheddar cheese and macaroni.  You may find yourself drowning in saliva while eating this ambrosia.  Then, they bring you the bill....  Although it isn't too bad, it's still pricey.  Then, it's time for desert!  They have about 20 different types of cheesecake.  It takes a while to decide.  My favorite is the ""lemon raspberry.""  Be careful about when you come.  During Christmas shopping season, waits can be as long as two hours.  Normally, they're about 45 minutes.  If you get there early or on a weekday, you may be seated immediately.  This place is a must-try."
Jessica C.,"Sacramento, CA",127,67,10,3.0,3/26/2008,"Hmmm...what can I say?! The Cheesecake Factory is so inconsistent with their food and service, it was just inevitable to get 3 stars. I mean, it's not extremely bad (just knocked down 2 stars), but it could always be better. First of all, I have my favorites like the pastas and dessert. Perfect pasta for me is al dente. Sometimes it's over cooked and sometimes it's not even cooked. How can you get pasta wrong?! Then another time, I ordered their house salad and instead I got brown chunks of lettuce on a small plate. Usually the salads are huge (can share with 2 people), but that one time, I got a plate that looked like it was sitting in the fridge pre-made for the last week or so. Gross right?! So gross. Other times I get lazy waiters/waitresses who look like they're fed up with serving. Dude, be happy you're serving me cause I am pretty generous with tips. You would really have to f* up pretty bad to get a bad tip. Well, because sometimes I need a place to eat as a default, Cheesecake is it. The price is decent and if you don't like your food, they comp you out a new one. You just have to be patient."
Camille C.,"Sacramento, CA",25,162,3,3.0,8/31/2007,"I've only been to the cheesecake factory a handful of times, but I was never impressed. The menu is huge--in fact, it's too big for my liking--it takes me forever to decide what to order. The food is okay, nothing amazing. The best thing about this place is (duh!) the cheesecake."
Big Appetite K.,"San Jose, CA",29,123,,4.0,8/31/2007,"It took a while for Cheesecake Factory to be established in Sacramento, but it seems like it's been a hit w/ the public so far. Although it seems like there are mixed reviews of this place, I've had some good dinners here. They offer a multitude of options, including (of course) tons of different cheesecakes. I really love the dulce de leche chessecake, but that's usually after a meal. As for the meals... Their Macadamian Crusted Ono is one of my favorites, and their various pasta dishes are nice too. They also have a Soy-glazed Salmon, which is tasty. They also have some nice appetizers as well, if you're in need of starting off the meal with something to get you going. This place definitely doesn't cut you short on options or variety, but one thing that I really don't like are the long waits. I happened to have dined here when it seems busy, but it might be that it'll be busy here for a while, since it's still one of the newer options in the area. The service was nice, and my servers seemed attentive every time I've dined here... As for parking, the restaurant is located in a busy plaza, so sometimes it'll take you a while to find a decent spot... But, you will more than likely end up having to walk a bit from your car to the restaurant... As for bringing kids or family, it's not a bad option. Although the crowd tends to be more adult than kids, it does have a Kid's Menu available... And what kid doesn't like cheesecake, right?"
Justin G.,"Sacramento, CA",2,6,,4.0,12/20/2008,The portions are massive. the food is great. lots of menu choices and its a great environment.
Vernon N.,"Lincoln, CA",0,14,,4.0,5/7/2008,"I haven't been disappointed yet.  This is a very popular and busy place, so I expect the service to be a little distracted.  That said, the food has been pretty good.  The menu is a collection of fun dishes.  I have my favorite - Chicken Madera.  The portions are large and most items are pretty good.  I haven't found anything that I thought was bad.  I like the looks of the place  - it's not a serious dinner restaurant - it's a fun place for gathering with friends and having drinks before hitting a movie."
