Tuan N.,"Stockton, CA",58,32,25,5.0,9/13/2017,This place never disappoint me. Food is always good . The atmosphere is good.  Can't good wrong with this cheese cake factory
Natisha R.,"Elk Grove, CA",21,50,76,4.0,3/4/2017,"I rarely go to cheesecake, but the days I've gone always received great service from waiters. If you go during the weekends or peek hours than be prepared to wait and they don't do call aheads. Always love the complimentary breads they give. I usually order the firecracker salmon or calamari as appetizers. The firecracker salmon is amazing but they only give 4 pieces for the price of $12. Yes, like the other yelpers have stated that the main dishes can be pricey but the portion of food given is a lot, I always ended up sharing a plate with someone else. Also, at times parking can be a hassle since the complex is right next to the mall, and during busy days parking lots get full quicker."
Kavita S.,"San Jose, CA",135,106,22,4.0,8/11/2016,I'm surprised by this place only has 3.5 stars. I've had great experiences here. Customer service is great! Good was always delicious and if I ever didn't like something they immediately changed it or brought me another. It's usually so busy since the mall is right there but I've never really had to wait long.
Dee D.,"Sacramento, CA",16,151,793,4.0,2/27/2017,"I pretty much only go here for cheesecake to go!  Adam's peanut butter cheesecake is my favorite- so good with big chunks of reese's and butterfinger.  The lemon meringue cheesecake is a close second - they actually take the time to torch the marshmallow topping!  Be sure to take advantage of the up-close to-go parking, and you will be in and out in no time!"
Lori L.,"Stockton, CA",34,5,,1.0,8/16/2017,Service sucked. Waited 20 minutes at our table and had to go ask the manager when someone was coming to our table as every table around us was served. They took half the was wrong when we did get our food. Food was not very good order pasta where to add chicken was $4 more and it was only 5 small pieces of chicken in the pasta that were dried out.
Nikki P.,"Sacramento, CA",0,19,,4.0,9/2/2017,"I just come here for the cheesecake, like many people.  I got a piece of the 30th anniversary cake, because it looked completely insane. I ended up eating half for breakfast because I could not avoid temptation anymore. I regret nothing. Next time I'm getting the pumpkin, I wait all year for that. When it comes to your cheesecake, change nothing you guys."
Karen K.,"Elk Grove, CA",1432,1112,18424,4.0,8/30/2015,"After passing through the Jewish food festival bc of its crowds and another busy breakfast spot we decided upon  Cheesecake Factory. This was because it was nearby and we did have a gift card burning a hole in my wallet. I'm pretty aware they usually open at 1100 AM. Well on Sundays it's 1000 AM. Lucky for us there was no wait and we requested to sit out on the patio. Both my hubby and I thought this was an awesome choice as we like to eat outside and when it's not crazy busy!!! Yes! Our waiter JT was very laid back but attentive as he came back to refill our drinks without us asking. I chose to eat healthy and had skinnylicious salmon. We did receive wheat and sourdough bread. Both were delish as well as my entree of salmon and veggies that consisted of asparagus spears, chopped, crunchy carrots and my fave green beans! All in all everything was yummy and really no complaints! If you haven't ever eaten at Cheesecake Factory their menu is like a book! We have been here several times although it's probably been over five years I think! They even had a special SkinnyLicious menu designed for those who wish to eat an entree lower in calories but yet have delicious tasting meal. Both my hubby and I ordered from this menu and it was amazing! I actually chose not to have dessert here as I had something else in mind! The reason for one star reduction is outside the patio its view is Arden Way and the parking lot. It's not super pretty but it wouldn't keep me from coming back here again as we had great service and wonderful food!"
Kenneth K.,"Sacramento, CA",229,452,5526,4.0,8/30/2015,"Honestly, I can't remember when the last time we had eaten here at ""The Cheesecake Factory"" on Arden Way. We must have driven by this place a million times!  My wife and I just happen to be in the area after checking out a food fair at a local Jewish Temple down the street. Coming all the way from Elk Grove, we didn't want to go home right away. The Cheesecake Factory sounded like the perfect place to have breakfast or brunch on this Sunday morning.  We had gotten there around 10:30 this morning. As you enter the restaurant, you'll find comfortable bench seating on your right, and a case full of tempting cheesecakes and desserts on your left. They also have a full service bar. Coming this early in the morning, we were able to find close parking as well as not having to wait to be seated. This place can accommodate a large number of customers. There were tons of tables and chairs and also a large number of booths. A perfect place to bring the family to wine and dine. This was a perfect morning to dine outside. They have a huge outdoor dining area! There must be at least 25 tables out there. They offer so many different items on their menu that the menu comes in a little book. There seems to be something for everyone! Starting with appetizers and salads, pizzas, hamburgers, sandwiches, soups, pasta, fish and seafood, steaks and chops. They also serve eggs and omelettes all day long, and Sunday Brunch until 2:00 pm. It was nice to know that they also offer a large number of Vegan Entrees! Today I ordered out of their ""SKINNYLICIOUS"" Menu. I had their ""Sausage and Ricotta"" baked flatbread.(Sausage and Ricotta Cheese with Fontina, Parmesan and Romano Cheese and Herbs). ""Only 490 Calories! "" The flatbread came out ""Hot"". The crust was just the right thickness. Not to thin but yet not to thick. Does that make any sense ? Oh well! This was one of the best tasting flatbread I had in a while.  My wife also ordered out of their ""SKINNYLICIOUS"" Menu. She  had their grilled salmon with steamed asparagus, carrots, and her favorite green beans. The size of the salmon was not small by no means. I would say it was a 4 to 5 oz piece. Cooked perfectly. The vegetables were cooked just the way she likes. Not over cooked, but still on the crunchy side. All of this under 590 calories ! You got to be kidding! The service today was fantastic. Our waiter JT was  very attentive and very professional. He took our order promptly and made sure our glasses were never empty! I mentioned to my wife how impressed I was with JTs service . We had to pass on dessert today. But we'll make sure we leave room for dessert the next time we come.  We had a wonderful time today! And will surely be back soon! "" UNTIL WE MEET AGAIN"""
Angelique L.,"Fairfield, CA",227,138,131,5.0,1/17/2017,"Went here Friday for a friend's birthday and had a really good experience. We didn't have to wait too long and our server was great! I forget his name but he was a young guy, very personable and attentive. I normally go to the one in Roseville, but definitely had a great experience at this location and would go again. I had their skinnylicious Chicken enchiladas, we shared the Cuban rolls and took home the Hazelnut crunch cheesecake, all were absolutely delicious. I love the fact that they have such a large menu, makes it great spot to go with bigger parties that may have picky people."
Jennifer U.,"Sacramento, CA",57,207,148,4.0,1/17/2017,"First of all, the brown bread in the bread basket is delicious! We asked for 2nds of that bread lol! Food was yummy and you must try the cheesecake. I wanted something was coffee so the Kahlua one was Devine. Only issue was the length of time to get our food, but it's worth the wait"
Ben S.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",0,1,,5.0,8/19/2017,"Great place, was recently in right before closing. Ordered coffee and tea for two. Server was full of energy even though it was past midnight. Made us smile. Didn't charge."
Yappy Yuppy Yelper Y.,"Elk Grove, CA",5,74,245,5.0,2/11/2017,Excellent desserts. My word the cheesecake selection is simply heaven inspired! My fat cells are dancing in joyous unison.
Jamie S.,"West Sacramento, CA",0,1,1,1.0,11/10/2017,"I do NOT recommend using the curb side to go order service with The Cheesecake Factory. Tonight I called my dinner order in (Fish N Chips and the Spicy Chicken Sandwich with Fries) and was told it would be ready in 20 minutes. I arrived about 20 minutes later and called to let them know I had arrived to pick up my order. The person who answered (Silvia) transferred me over to the to go section. I waited on hold for 14 minutes and not one person picked up that line. I hung up and then called back. Silvia answered again and I let her know I waited on hold for about 15 minutes to let them know that I was there to pick up my order. She said they were busy and she would let them know I was there. Another 20 minutes went by and still no one had brought our food out. I called back and Silvia answered again...I explained it had be close to 1 hour since I made my order and had been waiting for my order for 40 minutes. She apologized and said she would let them know. 5 minutes later a server came out to our truck with the receipt for our order to collect payment before he brought out our food. I told him I was really frustrated because it had been an hour since I called in my ordered and I was originally told it would be about 20 minutes. I told him I had been waiting in my car for 40 minutes and have called 3 times to let them know I was there for my order. The server was baffled that I had called 3 times and proceeded to tell me that they JUST NOW told him we were there to pick up our order. He told me he would go get a manager to speak to me. A few minutes later he came back out with our food and a manager. I explained my frustration about the situation and asked her if my food had been sitting in there the whole time. Neither the manager or the server knew how long our food was sitting out from. I told her that we had ordered fish N chips and that is not something that should be sitting out for a period of time if that was the case. She said she was going to take care of our charges and said I have your food here now for you. We really just wanted our food and wanted to get home. The worst part is that when we got home and pulled the food out nothing was edible. The fries were cold and hard as rocks, his fish was soggy and cold, my chicken sandwich was hard and cold. This told me that our food sat out for an extended period of time, yet the manager still gave it to us. This was all the way around unacceptable! I much rather have paid for my meal and gotten edible food."
Sierra G.,"Marysville, CA",70,3,2,5.0,4/13/2017,"We went there last night for an anniversary dinner I have to our waiter Zachary B. Who waited on us over in the bar area. Was one of the best service we have!! He was so polite very kind. Checked on this multiple times throughout our meal to make sure we needed things. We have never really had service  like that, even some of the most finest restaurants. we've been to which if you count Lucille's fine dining. Even when we go to BJ's Brewhouse or the Elephant Bar we never get service like this. You guys really need to applaud him for his service he made our meal and a anniversary dinner just that much more special if I had more I would have given him a generous tip"
Emerald M.,"Sacramento, CA",8,2,,1.0,11/3/2017,"Doesn't even deserve one star. Honestly at first I wasn't even that mad. Basically online order was messed up and I thought I would just call and they would offer to remake it and I could go pick it up for dinner after work. However what upset me was the way this was handled - so unprofessional and lazy. This WAS a door dash order so I get that the money is handled through Door Dash- fine. You would think though, that since CHEESECAKE FACTORY'S employee is the one who royally messed up the salad, they would take responsibility. But no. Door dash is responsible for the delivery and they did great - arrived early, no hassle... The restaurant is supposed to know how to make their own food. I ordered The Vegan Cobb salad and not only did it have CHEESE (hello...not vegan) but it had two other items it was NOT supposed to have. Also, it was MISSING 5 major items which made up the bulk of the salad -  almonds, sunflower seeds, quinoa, garbanzo beans, and avocado were all missing. When I called and spoke with the hostess she was really nice but then gave me to the manager, Dandy. Dandy was super inflexible, took no responsibility, did not apologize or offer any compensation just kept saying I had to go through door dash. I was *not asking him to give me my money back* all I wanted was for it to be remade. When I asked him for his name he hung up on me. I called back and called him out on it. He denied it. I finally got his name and the name of his manager - gave me the CEO of Cheesecake Factory - David Overton... don't tell me you don't have a manager besides the CEO geez. How do people keep jobs these days??"
Dina S.,"Davis, CA",195,106,137,5.0,1/15/2017,"i like cheesecake factory! we usually go there for casual dinner with my boyfriend!  i tried cheesecake restaurants everywhere! san Jose , san Francisco, palo alto , las Vegas and here!  this one was the best not because of the menu but because of our server! we usually get wheat bread and side of ranch instead of white bread and butter(its delicious, try it) and always when we asked them just wheat bread and ranch they act like they gonna pay for it! and they don't like it!  but this one was so nice and she was so fast  she gave us 2 baskets of wheat bread and ranch sauce and when we where done she asked if we want more!  she was nice! really good customer service because of her!"
Julie B.,"San Diego, CA",146,5,,5.0,8/6/2017,Loved the service and the food was by far amazing. Every Monday - Thursday you get a free cheesecake if you spend $30 or more. This offer lasts until October.
Jean S.,"Sacramento, CA",203,244,1450,4.0,8/1/2015,"Our service was top notch! I came here on National Cheesecake Day (7/30) and was seated outside. Our server, Costas, was super friendly, helpful, patient, and had an all-around genuine and positive attitude. The service he provided was fantastic, definitely one of the best service experiences I've had.  The Cheesecake Factory now has a new superfoods menu! Perfect, since healthy eating has been making trends lately and people are more conscious of the foods they are eating. I ordered the almond-crusted salmon salad - pan seared salmon over a salad of kale, brussel sprouts, arugula, avocado, quinoa, cranberries, radishes, and vinaigrette dressing. The salmon was very tender and delicious. The kitchen forget to include the avocado, but our server brought some on the side. Apparently the new menu has only been out for a week so the kitchen was not super familiar with it yet.  I guess after eating a super good food, it's time to eat the super bad food...yet also super good in its own way. The Oreo cheesecake...aka Oreo Dream Extreme is my favorite and I just cannot order any other! Although many other flavors taste good, no other can match the rich, decadent, awesomeness of the Oreo cheesecake. I've been to Cheesecake Factory at least 3 times this year and probably 5 times within the last couple years and each time I've ordered the Oreo cheesecake. I've have tried the tiramisu, s'mores, and chocolate cheesecake, which are all good, but still love the Oreo best. In previous visits, I've had the herb crusted salmon, chicken marsala pasta, and a cheeseburger. The herb salmon was really tender and perfect, the chicken marsala pasta was flavorful and delicious, but the burger was not good. The burger was dry and plain tasting, definitely not their specialty. Also on the negative side, the prices are a tad bit high and there can be a long wait for a table. But overall the food at the Cheesecake Factory is above average, the service is excellent, and the cheesecake can't be beat!"
Raul C.,"Sacramento, CA",0,16,11,3.0,8/27/2017,"Food is a bit expensive with an average of quality. Cakes are good, that's why 3 starts."
