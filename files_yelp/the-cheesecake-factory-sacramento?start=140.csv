Olivia H.,"Sacramento, CA",2,83,12,1.0,1/11/2017,Horrible customer service and food was so gross. I ordered a Cobb salad and it was soggy and pretty much inedible. They saturated it with vinaigrette dressing and some other weird stuff. My picture speaks for itself.
Melanie V.,"Sacramento, CA",1,30,27,4.0,7/24/2017,"Cheesecake is one of my favorite spots for a casual lunch or dinner. The food is always delicious and never disappoints. The menu have is very extensive. There is something for everyone. The good service is always consistent too, even if they are busy."
Thomas L.,"Fair Oaks, CA",1,15,2,1.0,3/3/2017,"This use to be a good place to eat in terms of quality and quantity so I don't mind paying a higher price.  However, this is the last time due to smaller portions and lower quality for the second time in a Row. Must be making up for the mandatory min wage."
Jaskarn S.,"Sacramento, CA",0,4,,2.0,8/7/2017,"A little disappointed, food was cold took a long time to get to us as well. Came in here for a good proper meal but left very unsatisfied! Our server was great though no problem with her."
Saphire L.,"Sacramento, CA",0,2,4,5.0,11/2/2017,"The Cheesecake factory is so beautiful and clean. Their food is delicious as well as their deserts, cheesecakes. The waiters/waitresses are so kind and helpful. This is the place is to dine at for yummy food and cheesecakes! Try the Smores Cheesecake. Very delicious and yummy. It is a restaurant, but you can just order your cheesecake, get it and leave."
Avtar S.,"Woodland, CA",28,98,112,4.0,12/10/2016,Came in just for the cheesacake to go. You can't go won't trying a cheese cake here. Would give 5 but piece was smaller than usual.
Daniil C.,"Antelope, CA",92,18,28,1.0,8/15/2017,Service was poor. Ordered a filet mignon to be medium rare with pink meat and no blood. Got an overcooked- well well done steak. Appetizer portions were tiny- and I mean 3 bite tiny! Food was overall bland and not good. Loud place and bad overall place to eat out with someone.
Jana C.,"East Bay, CA",470,2986,10633,4.0,6/25/2015,"Lunch was very satisfying, though, aside from the food, service was not too hot.  My salad was bit overdressed and mea culpa for not ordering it on the side. A fan of this chain , forever. Always something for every eater---& the desserts!!!!!"
Mykala B.,"Sacramento, CA",67,12,3,3.0,7/10/2017,My boyfriend and i decided to try it out for the first time and honestly it was just subpar. It wasnt anything fancy. To be completely honest it was a little overpriced for what we got. The cheesecake itself was really good so I would suggest just coming here for a date night to get dessert.
Anna P.,"Moreno Valley, CA",2,15,4,5.0,7/18/2017,My first time to The Cheesecake Factory and I am not sure why I have never been to one! We were there with a party of seven to celebrate my siblings birthday. The service was very good and the waitress was an awesome sweet gal!!! She made it a wonderful experience for us.The food and cheesecake was delicious!I will definitely come back and visit them again!:)
IslandGirl 3.,"Sacramento, CA",10,118,332,2.0,1/19/2017,"I got a gift card so i decided to try it out. I was dissapointed. Food was bland and whats up with that bread and butter, they were both hard. I'll pass on Cheese cake factory"
Raj M.,"Natomas, Sacramento, CA",92,42,1372,4.0,9/9/2016,"Must Try items if you haven't 1) Louisiana Chicken Pasta ~Parmesan crusted chicken served over pasta with mushrooms, peppers and onions in a spicy new orleans sauce.  Not too spicy but spicy enough to feel the bern ;) 10/10  2)Cucumber Lemonade 8/10 ~ Very refreshing plus free refills  3)Mocha( non fat, light choc, x-hot)             ~ Surprisingly hit the spot 8/10.  4) Now feeling lazy and won't hit the gym ~ My personal points 0/10 :) #NoRegrets #YOLO"
Tina H.,"Elk Grove, CA",121,24,3,4.0,12/29/2016,"I think every time I go to Arden Mall with my best friend, we always end up eating here, not that I'm complaining.  One time I came here with my family to celebrate my mom's birthday and they had a great experience, we all ordered pasta dishes too. For drinks, I tried the J.W. Pink Lemonade and it was okay. For dessert, we got the tiramisu and it was my first time eating it. Our server forgot my dad's cappucino, so I had to remind her, and she didn't check up on us as much as she could have, but I understand since I'm also a server at a busy restaurant. The portions are absolutely huge, so the prices are reasonable. Unfortunately, I don't really like cheesecake (definitely I'm in the minority here), but I come here for the pasta dishes and yummy appetizers.  I recently came here about a week ago with my best friend (after an exhausting adventure of finding Christmas gifts) and we had to wait for about 20 minutes. When we were seated, we were immediately greeted by our server and ordered drinks. I got the Louisiana Chicken Pasta and my best friend got another pasta dish, but I forgot what it was. We both enjoyed our dishes and our server came by regularly to refill our drinks and check up on us and our meal. However, midway through our dining experience, our server just disappeared and was nowhere to be found, but that's okay, because another server noticed or either took over, and took good care of my best friend and I whenever we needed anything like drink refills or boxes and the check. Overall, the food is great and the service is always on point even when it's super busy! Definitely recommend this place."
Marisa D.,"Sacramento, CA",20,3,8,1.0,8/1/2017,A long wait for overpriced bland lackluster food delivered with an attitude. This is why I hate chain restaurants.
Craig D.,"Sacramento, CA",0,12,1,2.0,10/23/2016,"I typically like the Cheesecake Factory, it's one of my favorite restaurants. This review is based on one bad experience and the disappointment of what I was served. I am disappointed in the chef and whoever packed the to-go box, thinking it is okay to serve this food. I did take out and have ordered my favorite Steak Diane with an add side of asparagus. My medium-rare steak ended up being medium-well and the worst part was my burnt asparagus. Not slightly charcoal, burnt. How does that come out of a kitchen in packed for someone to eat. I paid extra to have completely burnt asparagus. Big let down."
Brandi J.,"Sacramento, CA",13,31,68,5.0,12/22/2016,Dinner with a lovely gentleman. This was our first date and it was very romantic. The service was awesome ambience was nice and the food was really good. My favorite part beside my date and the food was ths chocolate dream cheesecake I think it was called...omg so freakin good I could got naked and had my date now my boyfriend lick it off right there...I kno TMI but Idc lol it was good!!
Samantha P.,"West Sacramento, CA",78,1,9,5.0,1/19/2017,"What a wonderful experience at the Cheesecake Factory this evening. The food was delicious with amazing flavor and hot when it arrived to the table. We enjoyed the steak and salmon dinner, sausage and ricotta flatbread and the egg roll combo appetizer. Everything we had was on point and of course the cheesecake was scrumptiously amazing. To top it off our waitress was very pleasant and offered top notch service."
Romeo S.,"Sacramento, CA",0,2,1,1.0,12/6/2017,"Let me start off by stating that I love this place and my review is based on an experience we recently had. I must state that I do work in the same complex as these guys so I am more favorable of my opinions towards this place, but not this time. However, We see the same security walk and drive by daily. We park behind the green lines everyday. So if the server who helped us had come into our store, knowing he worked closed by, we would ensure his experience was nothing less than exceptional. This server had a condescending demeanor about him. He did not come by for a while and when we waived him down we had to practically beg for more water. In doing so, he rolled his eyes, walked away and returned with a slam on our table with more water. I am so perplexed to how he is in customer service. No one should be treated as if they were less than a human, especially not in a professional environment. Our horrific experience has tainted our impression on this once great location which has now forced us to do our monthly meetings at another restaurant in the complex. So who was responsible for this horrendous behavior that it has forced me to write such a review? The demonic servers name is Luis M. And if you are punished by receiving him as your server, run and run fast. This review will go on TripAdvisor as well because no one visiting Sacramento needs to have a misconstrued impression of our great people who lives here as Luis is not from Sacramento but hell itself."
Marisela M.,"Citrus Heights, CA",23,95,715,4.0,8/21/2015,"Service was excellent.the food was delicious.i enjoyed the fish and fries with cole slaw.the Cole slaw was a little bland but the fish and fries was what I wanted. My son's birthday date night with his parents was his first time here (mine too).he got the mac n cheese burger with sweet potato fries.the mac n cheese is fried really good taste.different but yummy. My only complaint is my husband order steak and   took way too long for us to recieve our order.they came and let us know they over cooked his steak and gave him a complementary clam chowder.which had a great   complaint is this after waiting 50 min for our food he got his plate,his steak was so small and thin that it was disappointing. My son did get sung to and got a nice small dessert.  All in all it was good food and great company,but the prices are high.nothing that really stands out.Sad but true."
Cubana Q.,"Sacramento, CA",1,6,9,1.0,9/5/2016,OK so I left a message..... And guys still haven't got back to me so don't try to make it seem like you guys to care me $41 wasted with a screw in my Egg Rolls. And my Cuban sandwich barely had meat inside of it with a lot of pickles with that being said you guys are terrible at cooking and customer service not cool...
