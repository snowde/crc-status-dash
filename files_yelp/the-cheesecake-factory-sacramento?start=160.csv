Quira B.,"Sacramento, CA",156,58,253,1.0,3/15/2017,"Very very disappointed we went here with our work to celebrate a few birthdays! They didn't have our tables ready by the time we arrived, we got seated but didn't get our drinks and bread until 30 minutes after being seated and an hour in still had no food! I didn't get to enjoy my lunch since I had to leave and get back to the office. My coworkers had to bring me my lunch in the office and I had to eat while working! This is beyond unacceptable! A party of 11 during lunch for birthday and the entire lunch hour our food never arrived!"
Sylvester C.,"San Francisco, CA",567,90,121,3.0,9/24/2016,"Three stars sums up quite well as my experience was a little disappointing due to the 45 minutes I had to wait to get my food. It does not really matter whether the main course is good or not when there is such a long wait. The good part is that while I was waiting one of the bus-boys smuggled stuffed cheese olives from the bar. He fed me olives as I was waiting and did not charge me so I guess he stole them. I felt bad about it so I tipped him $5 which also made my lunch significantly more expensive. The stuffed olives were fantastic! I'll come back next time I have more time for lunch, probably during my weekend. I may also come back another time if I am in a mood for sampling stuffed olives, but one thing is for sure, I am not coming back whenever I have to come back to work in less than an hour."
Andrew F.,"Elk Grove, CA",27,72,,5.0,6/8/2017,"Really good service (waiter boxed everything and complied to all service requests and more), perfume scented atmosphere and bathrooms, ordered chicken bellogia and it was good for two meals with the leftovers and was very tasty with good texture and flavor. Lemonade was on the sweet side but was nice to have. Oh and the cheesecake was very good -- I actually dislike most cheesecake but this was . Side warning, with sweets and cheesecake you are bound to have a little heartburn for the rest of the workday if you're working but it was goood"
Natalie S.,"Sacramento, CA",32,15,1,4.0,6/7/2017,Always tasty. Good for groups. The wait always seems to be shorter than expected. Putty that they don't take reservations but makes sense. You'd never get seated otherwise.
Sereena T.,"Sacramento, CA",122,113,78,5.0,9/15/2016,"Every single meal that we ordered was delicious -- we all tasted each other's meals so I know lol! I am trying to watch calories so I was almost dreading coming and being tempted with all the yummy, not so good for you dishes . However, they have a ""skinnylishes"" menu with PLENTY of options of low calorie cocktails, appetizers and main dishes.  I ordered the Tuscan Chicken. Yum. The cherry tomatoes were seasoned with a flavorful dressing and the chicken breast was grilled perfectly. I subbed for brown rice which can be hard to cook, but I couldn't stop dogging in! So I had to give into temptation and ordered a low carb cheesecake. Maybe it's in my head,but it's a tad less tasty than the regular original cheesecake. Just not as rich. Still hit the sweet tooth craving .  Our server mike was friendly, attentive and not to pesty. He placed my to-go order to find it to arrive as we were leaving which was a nice touch. One of the hosts that gave us the buzzer could have smiled and not seem like she hated life, but maybe it's a bad day for her lol. She quoted a 15min wait but it was closer to 10min. It's always freezing in the restaurant but maybe it's just me ..."
Anitha N.,"Stockton, CA",0,4,,4.0,10/8/2017,This is my second time coming here. It was super packed but I got seated in less than 5 mins but that's probably because it was a party of two. I ordered the eggplant Parmesan. This was my first time eating it & it was good ! It was a big portion & it tasted just like chicken Parmesan. The waitress was very attentive & friendly .
Gale S.,"Galt, CA",0,11,,5.0,10/15/2017,"Went last night, 10/15/17, since my husband was craving the Shepherds Pie.  Very busy but got seated fairly quickly.  All our food was delicious even though it took a little longer to arrive, but as I said, it was very busy so that is to be expected.  Service was outstanding and Cassandra did a terrific job!  Checked often to see how things were or if we needed anything.  Thanks for another great meal at The Cheesecake Factory."
Brittney W.,"Sacramento, CA",0,8,7,1.0,10/7/2017,I called and was trying to get information and the guy named Lucas hung up in my face! So damn rude. I called back and the girl who answered told me it would be 15 minutes to talk to anyone.
Cindy M.,"Santa Cruz, CA",688,437,34,5.0,2/9/2016,"I forgot my waitress' name but she was hands down the best waitress I've ever had! This place was packed when my friend & I came in to eat lunch but we were quickly seated and given great customer service. Lunch time 2 days before Xmas was not fun. Complimentary bread was so yum, our food was phenomenal, and the dessert...don't get me started.  I ordered this sausage pasta lunch thing (haha, I forgot the name) and it was a very generous portion. I had lunch and dinner for the day.  Few things to mention: -I didn't take stars off for this, obviously, but the servers behind the dessert cases weren't very friendly. They weren't rude but you could tell that they were irritated for some reason. Our waitress was so amazing that I can't take stars off.  -Parking is super annoying. You're competing with the mall, so if you're coming in peak hours or on weekends, you're going to end up driving in circles for a while."
Michael N.,"Sacramento, CA",0,3,,1.0,10/14/2017,"This used to be a good place.   Now the drinks are watered down, food was just blah  and some of our favorite menu choices are gone.   Won't be returning"
Randy L.,"West Sacramento, CA",5,14,67,3.0,8/20/2016,"Well let me start off by apologizing for being the spoil alert because it may be someone's next dining out destination...Well for my first experience it wasn't a great one.   For starters we order there big salad for an appetizer lets just say I've had better salad at Raley's  or Mc Donalds then the one that was brought to us the salad dressing was like the main feature totally saturating the salad to the point of like having corn flakes left in milk over night (no appeal) croutons were not crunchy and fresh but stale the slices of tomato felt thick and hard like they weren't ripe enough.  felt like it was going to be a rough start.  It is my Girls Bday wknd so I'll keep it cool.  Anyways moving right along I ordered the Egg plant parmesan which was Amazing but looked like they  lined up four breaded egg plant patties (stuff you can probably find at Grocery outlet) huh? Nando  V  :) and made some sauce to drench over it but surprisingly it was good it came with pesto pasta it was OK( had better) all in all I just feel like for the price which was not a factor but ,people should at least get what they  pay for! My girl didn't enjoy her food either but ill let her write her own Review. I will not be back maybe only for there dessert, I've had there cheese cake and that is worth the slice:)"
Angie S.,"Vacaville, CA",0,26,29,2.0,12/30/2016,"Not sure if off night orrr.... First time here & I couldn't be more disappointed! Luckily we had a wonderful server but there was so much wrong with this visit. Busy Friday night and we didn't have a reservation so a 40 minute wait wasn't really all that bad. 1 star for the range of the buzzer.. got to get my Ulta on while waiting!  We get seated and immediately order drinks. My Pineapple Mojito came out 20 minutes later making its debut sans pineapple, extra H20 and pretty freakin gross. So 20 minutes later again, I asked for a Bourbon & Honey. Better, but still pretty gross.  I ordered a Kobe mushroom burger and requested they add arugula, and a salad as my side. What I got? A kobe mushroom burger with no arugula but a lovely side salad consisting of only arugula... and ranch. My friend ordered a shrimp pasta that was 90% garlic, 8% pasta and 2% shrimp. It had to be sent back and exchanged for a classic burger which was so mediocre it should be Webster's default picture for the word in the dictionary.  I really hate to judge this place on a busy Friday night but it is what it is. Thank you to the waitress for being so cheery and accommodating!"
Jason H.,"Hayward, CA",4,4,1,3.0,7/3/2017,"The server was very attentive. However, the whole experience was mediocre at best. When we first sat down, the server brought waters to us, and asked, ""is water okay?"" I looked like, ""sure."" He politely handed us the menus and then left. I'm very aware of my surroundings, and he brought us our bread. May I add which is good. But, this is to say the people/group next to us he ask, ""would you guys' care for some bread?"" Hm, and you didn't ask us that, you just brought it. Thanks, buddy. When he was taking my girlfriend's and I order, I ordered the simple Steak Diane with Shrimp Scampi, and the GF had the Steak Diane by itself. Medium-well for both. Then he just takes the menu without asking what else I would like. HOW RUDE?! Place is alright, prices are eh, atmosphere there is none."
Vincent D.,"Sacramento, CA",7,4,56,4.0,10/15/2016,"The burgers and fries are great. The complimentary bread and butter is good too. I always make sure to try each kind of bread before leaving. There are so many different types of food to choose from on the menu. They have pasta, salad, soup, burgers, chicken, buffalo wings, tacos, nachos, samosas, egg rolls, wonton, potstickers, and many more. For a cheesecake place, that is pretty impressive.  I'll have to try their pasta or cheesecake sometime. It's a really nice place to grab lunch or dinner with a group of people. The restaurant is big, fancy, and feels like a castle."
Natalie K.,"Sacramento, CA",0,1,2,1.0,10/13/2017,"I have never made a yelp review before because I don't like trashing restaurants or other places  but I just had to for this particular situation. I love Cheesecake Factory, I am never disappointed when I get food from here but last night it was just awful. I order take-out for the first time which was a BIG mistake. First let me say that I was so happy to order from here because I found a old $25 Cheesecake Factory gift card and I was excited to use it because I didn't have to cook dinner. When I called in, I was put on hold for 15 minutes. Being put on hold for that long, I was pissed my mood was ruined. Then finally they took me off hold and apologized and everything, it was fine. I ordered and stuff and I arrived at the restaurant. Getting my food was fine, I did the curbside pickup, they didn't take too long and the waiter was very nice. Then when I got home, I was highly disappointed. My favorite pasta that I always get (Pasta da Vinci), it was just plain awful. There was literally no sauce, it tasted old, dry and it looked like they literally just microwaved it and put it in a take out box. And worst of it all the pasta wasn't even cooked, it was way undercooked and it was super cold! The bread that came with it tasted old and it was very cold. I literally live 5-10 minutes away, it shouldn't have been so cold. I tipped the waiter $8 just to get this piece of crap! I love Cheesecake Factory, it's one of my favorite places to get pasta, but I'm never ordering take out ever again. Seems like they don't care for take out orders and gives us whatever is old. They should have a person that is just for phone call take out orders so they're not distracted doing other things. Maybe it was a busy night, that's why I was put on hold for a while, which I understand  but the food was just plain disgusting and not Cheesecake Factory material. I was super happy to order from here but now I just wasted my $25 gift card. Thanks a lot!"
Steve T.,"Carmichael, CA",0,21,1,5.0,7/1/2017,"The food here is amazing, been here so many times and I have never been disappointed or upset. The price is good and the amount of food is always filling. There cheesecake is delicious."
Jennifer N.,"Sacramento, CA",581,458,1084,4.0,3/5/2016,FOOD - Mango Key Lime Cheesecake: great balance of sweet and tangy. The crust is a vanilla coconut macaroon crust which was a pleasant change from the normal graham cracker crust. 4.5/5 SERVICE I ordered my cheesecake to-go. The young man who took my order was friendly. 5/5 FINAL THOUGHTS I love cheesecakes! This one was worth the steep price of $8. I would come back for more :)
AnastasiyA P.,"West Sacramento, CA",0,5,3,4.0,6/26/2017,"It is hit or miss with this place. But this Sunday it was a hit. The food was good, the drinks were good. Our server was a delite. If i could only remember her name :) We ordered barbecue salad, Pasta davinci and hot boneless chicken. Everything came out just perfect. We'll be back."
Justin B.,"Livermore, CA",1556,258,124,5.0,8/2/2016,"Came here for my sisters and moms birthday lunch! The food is good, just like always. No sense on going into those details.  However, restaurants to me are more about customer service. We had Lorenzo as our waiter (8 people) and what I liked about him was the following: 1) He wrote down each and every single order placed. 2) Always kept the drinks filled. 3) Always checked to make sure everything was OK.  4) Checked to make sure our orders were correct.  5) Had a sense of humor!!!  Nice job Lorenzo! Keep up the good work. I know I will request your section each time I go in!"
Zaheem B.,"Elk Grove, CA",104,204,178,4.0,3/11/2016,"Where to start.. well I will admit this is probably my top chain restaurant! I think it's the variety that does it for me, they do several things well. My go to appetizer is the buffalo blast, Its the perfect mix of fried, chicken, spice, and cheese. Its their take on a buffalo wing and I am in love with it! This was also the first place I ever had fried mac n cheese, and till this day it is my favorite.  For dinner I also have several items I enjoy: kobe burger, cajun pasta, chicken madeira, farfale pasta, and the hibachi steak. During last nights visit I had the kobe burger and it was cooked perfectly, but the fries it came with tasted mediocre at best. I enjoyed a 22oz. Stela with the burger, which was the perfect mix to a long day at work. Thankfully I had a little room in the tank and ordered a chocolate cheesecake. The cake was fresh tasting and did not taste like a store bought cheesecake.  The only reason I can't give this place 5-stars is due to the spotty service. Unfortunately it is never consistent. I have had decent service, but on several occasions I have had poor service. I don't know why but the servers forget about you and aren't prompt majority of the times with requests (bread, extra sauce, utensils). On a side note I would also ask for the brightness of the lights to be slightly brighter, but I get the whole idea behind the ambiance factor, but at times I have to bring my face down to my plate in order to see specific ingredients in my food (First world problems)."
