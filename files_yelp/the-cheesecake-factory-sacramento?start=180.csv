May D.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",13,24,10,5.0,5/12/2017,"Thank you, Deandre, for the great service today! You made happy hour well worth it! We pretty much ordered every item on the menu and topped it off with some slices of Cheesecakes. Craig's Crazy Carrot Cake Cheesecake is so yummy!"
Breanna P.,"Sacramento, CA",435,121,176,5.0,7/30/2016,"This review is based on the take-out cheesecake orders, not the restaurant itself.  They have so many tasty cheesecakes to choose from, it's nearly impossible! I came here to grab a slice of cake for my friend's birthday. I couldn't decide between two of them and asked the cashier what his take was on both flavors. I decided to get the new caramel cheesecake which was a great recommendation from the cashier! I asked them if they had a candle since the cake was for a friend's birthday and they gave me one for free. I was so happy I didn't need to run to the store for one candle! I couldn't help myself and I was practically drooling so I ordered a slice of Chris' Outrageous for myself. They were both divine and we gobbled the cake up after singing happy birthday! It was a last minute purchase at 10pm and this is the best place to get specialty cheesecake."
Jasmin A.,"Winters, CA",1,3,4,5.0,6/3/2016,"Came to Cheesecake Factory to celebrate our wedding anniversary. Our server, Lorenzo was great! My husband and I appreciated the fact that he went above and beyond to meet our needs. (Thanks, Lorenzo).  Food was DELICIOUS as always. I ordered the Romano encrusted chicken (can't remember the exact name). It is my all time favorite dish. We ordered the guacamole for our appetizer and I was very happy with it.  Overall our experience was great!"
Tim C.,"San Francisco, CA",27,4,4,1.0,6/1/2017,"Overall the service started out normal. As with any Cheesecake Factory, busy, but not overly so that their service and timing of entrees leaving the kitchen would be delayed in such a way that would be noticeable. Our server took his time getting our drink order, which he got wrong despite bringing an alcoholic beverage to our table prior to checking our ID.  Our complimentary bread basket was only brought to our table after our server noticed he had brought the two adjacent tables theirs. Once our orders were taken, the wait seemed normal. Our appetizer came about 5-7 minutes after. However, our entrees took an additional 45 minutes to come out. A simple order of an omelette breakfast plate, and a Louisiana chicken pasta dinner.  Our server only checking in after about 15 minutes of our adjacent tables receiving their entrees. Who mind you, were 5-10 minutes later in arrival than us. Our server then gave us the update that the kitchen ""just got smacked"" and our orders were coming. Was that before or after our adjacent tables got their orders?  Once our entrees arrived it was immediately noticeable that the Louisiana chicken pasta had been sitting out for quite some time. The pasta was extremely rubbery, the chicken dry, and sauce had come down to a temperature only slightly above the room's.  Overall, surprisingly dissatisfied at the service. This is extremely rare as I've had many great experiences with this restaurant in their various locations. Maybe it was just an off night, but in either case, it will be a while before I step foot inside another Cheesecake Factory, or at least this location."
Nancy X.,"Sacramento, CA",64,113,140,3.0,5/7/2017,"This place is nice. I feel like it's overrated.  The food was decent, the service is okay,  but too overrated. I'd probably go back but I've ate at better places and better pricing and service too. The portions were okay and appetizers were good. I just feel like it was an okay place."
Sue D.,"Sacramento, CA",3,70,39,4.0,4/21/2017,"If you plan to come for dinner then expect parking to be somewhat difficult, the wait time to be longer than average, tons of people, and a loud atmosphere (particularly Fri-Sun). However, the food is always great as well as the service. Their speciality drinks are delicious and the cheesecake is top-notch of course. I'd suggest to never get cheesecake to-go because the portions are noticably smaller. And that's no good if you're ordering one as delicious as the salted caramel cheesecake."
jamie s.,"Fair Oaks, CA",119,93,253,4.0,10/17/2016,"This place is a solid eatery. I actually think their Cobb salad is my favorite anywhere! If someone told me I had to pick a salad to eat everyday forever, this is the one.  The service is always dependable and efficient. Rarely do you feel neglected here.  Other favorites White chicken chili - yum! Great cheap happy hour with tasty appetizers."
Darin H.,"West Sacramento, CA",22,117,228,4.0,12/11/2016,"Tried the Chicken and Shrimp Gumbo with the brown rice.  It was outstanding.  For a chain restaurant, it was a four star taste and texture.  Highly recommend if looking for a good Gumbo."
Natalya L.,"North Sacramento, Sacramento, CA",50,1,,2.0,7/1/2017,"I'm not one to complain when I come to a restaurant BUT I came here with my two cousins to eat their chicken and biscuits. We got the plates and discovered they did not plate the biscuits. We tell our waiter (who we both are convinced was high), and she tells us, ""Oh, I don't know why they didn't put it on the plate. Do you want me to bring them out?"" Well...duh. That'd be nice.  So she brings the biscuits out and not only are they cold, and I mean cold, they were over cooked when they made them so they were cold AND hard. At this point we ask to speak to the manager. She was nice about it. But now we're waiting for our food going on 20 minutes and at this point I just want to leave."
Fidel A.,"Stockton, CA",0,4,,1.0,5/24/2017,"It was an unfortunate experience. Here for a business trip and thought of having some cheesecake for desert. The service was poor, the pasta was not fully cooked, the lemonade was 90% sugar. SMH. So why even bother for some cheesecake. They asked and I told them-- so they offered to take the pasta dish out of the check but ehh... I paid it all to stand my ground! get it together guys! Come on!"
Ally B.,"El Dorado Hills, CA",82,1,,5.0,6/23/2017,"This is my first yelp review, I sat at the bar for lunch yesterday and although I didn't catch her name I felt the need to give the bartender props. It was extremely busy and I was in a hurry to eat and go because I had to get to work. Despite the fact that she had a full bar and was slinging drinks in the well like a rockstar she was so attentive to all the guests, and made a point to get me out of there in a decent time. Hell ya girl, your awesome. Oh, and the food was great too;)"
May S.,"Vallejo, CA",195,74,113,3.0,8/6/2016,"I love Cheesecake Factory, but the service here was not the best. We waited for about 30-40 minutes to be seated. The waiter took a lifetime to get our water and drinks refilled. The pasta they served was a little hard, might have not been cooked long enough. I couldn't even find the waiter because he disappeared after he dropped off our food, so that cut his tip right in half. Overall, i don't like giving negative reviews so I'm giving them 3-stars because there's room for improvement. Is there a next time for me? Hmm..depends on how hungry I am."
Alex S.,"Suisun City, CA",1,13,5,5.0,5/30/2017,Ate a late lunch here with my girlfriend. We were quick to be seated and greeted by a friendly waitress. The waitress was extremely helpful helping us find something on the menu we liked. Food came out at a great speed and tasted amazing. I got the meatloaf per the waitresses advice....im not a big meatloaf guy but this stuff was excellent. We finished our meals off with some of the best cheesecake we've ever had and couldn't be happier. The portions are huge here. We didn't get the lunch sized portions that are apparently smaller. A bit pricey at roughly +$25 a person including dessert but well worth a good date with your significant other or friends.
Julianna S.,"Sacramento, CA",92,3,,5.0,5/28/2017,"I only come here a few times a year since I'm in college and can't afford it often. Today I stopped by with a friend who'd never been previously, and it was super great! The fried mac and cheese appetizer balls are PERFECT (I would ask for some hot sauce on the side, it makes it just a bit better), and our entrees were good as well. Our server, Nicholas, was very friendly and personable. He even stepped into the kitchen to make my friend's dessert when the chefs were swamped! Good guy"
Jennifer G.,"Wahiawa, HI",157,22,6,1.0,4/16/2017,Food was ok.... service was horrible. Took forever to get our order taken and to get our check was another 10 mins. She asked if we wanted dessert and we said no and she walked away. So we sat for 10 mins waiting for our check. She sure did give all her other tables great service. Not throwing the race card out or that we had kids with us. But I have read about why waiters/waitress treat people a certain way. But my omelet was pretty good. Step up the service people.
Kya H.,"Sacramento, CA",1,11,7,3.0,3/12/2017,No black bread / the wheat bread :( took too long for our simply burgers 2hrs here total
April W.,"Modesto, CA",0,15,7,3.0,6/10/2017,"We usually eat at the Cheesecake Factory in Roseville but we were at the Arden Fair mall so we stopped in here. The server was nice but the service was slow. It took quite a while to get our entrees. I ordered the egg roll sampler and two of my egg rolls were so deep fried they weren't even edible. They literally disintegrated to crumbs when I picked them up. We ate at night, around 9 o clock and it is SO dark in there. I like to see what I'm eating but they keep the lights way too dim. All in all I'd give it 3 stars because the server was nice but the atmosphere and the food wasn't great."
Brad S.,"Red Bluff, CA",0,20,,2.0,6/10/2017,Only the french fries and cheesecake tasted as expected.   The lemon drop was poorly prepared and undrinkable  Service was good  Really not worth the money this time
Jacquie C.,"Elk Grove, CA",1,14,,5.0,2/2/2017,Very impressed with all the staff. I came to lunch with a disabled friend and her service dog and one of the customers complained about the dog. The server as well as management handled it so professionally my friend never even knew someone complained until after they moved them and I told her! My friend also left all her medication on the table in a pill container and forgot it..the staff put it in a safe until she could come back and get it. I work in a restaurant and actually met my friend because she was my customer. I know service dogs can be an uncomfortable and sticky situation for everyone involved but you guys handled it with such grace! Thank you so much for making everyone involved (including the guests that complained) happy. A++ Our server and the food were also GREAT!!
Katherine W.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,48,64,4.0,10/29/2016,So good! But service is a little slow. Took more than 5 minutes to greet us at the table. I come here every weekend. Best ice cream in Sac! :)))
