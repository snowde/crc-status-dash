Chris J.,"Antelope, CA",0,41,14,3.0,5/10/2017,"We all know the desserts are great, but why have as extensive a food menu as your desserts when you can't even cook a burger medium? (Especially the wagyu burger!) Smh."
Rebecca G.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",97,14,5,2.0,4/1/2017,"I normally don't write bad reviews, but this was a bad experience. We ordered to go and waited over 30 min once getting there, we decided to go up and ask about our food and they went to check and we waited a while longer. Once we got home, which is less than 5 min away, our food was cold and not whay we ordered. So sad that our food wasn't what we expected, probably won't be going back."
Rebecca A.,"Elk Grove, CA",66,81,22,3.0,7/30/2016,"Came here tonight for the first time with my boyfriend. We napped after work and woke up at 8pm hungry. We decided to use our gift card we got for here and have a late dinner.  Upon arrival at 9:20pm there wasn't a lot of parking open so we immediately prepared ourselves for a long wait. It was about 15-20 minutes though which is normal.  The waiting area and the cheesecake to go counter is right next to each other right as you enter, so the entrance is a cluster of people.  Once we got seated we immediately met our waitress who greeted us with hot bread and butter. She took our order of drinks: 2 waters and 1 Sierra Nevada(OMG IT WAS $9 ALMOST!!!) My water tasted really weird, almost like the taste of licking your finger after using nail polish remover. My boyfriends water was fine so I just didn't drink mine. I think it may have been something on the cup, maybe some soap residue making it taste a little strange. My boyfriend was ever so stoked to see the eggs and omelets are served all day! He's a huge breakfast foodie. He got a bacon ham and cheese omelet with English muffins and fried potatoes. He cut into his omelet and cheese, small bacon slices, and cubed ham just oozed out of it, it looked so good! He loved his food and was happy to have leftovers to heat up for breakfast. I got the cheese pizza. I have to say when it comes to pizza I don't care about anything, I'll eat whenever/where ever with any type of crust or cheese. When I bit into this pizza though I immediately got a smokey flavor almost like it was grilled? But the cheese had a very very fake taste. There were herbs like oregano and garlic in the cheese as well but it still couldn't mask the fake cheese flavor. Almost tasted like those off brand $1 cheese pizzas from the freezer aisle. It wasn't terrible but I didn't expect such a fake flavor from this restaurant. I asked for ranch to help change the flavor but the ranch was super sweet tasting at first and then ended tasting like garlic! I wasn't very impressed with my meal! Our waitress told us the cheesecake slices were half off tonight so we both got a slice! I of course being the caramel lover that I am got the Salted Caramel Cheesecake and my boyfriend being the Oreo fanatic he is got the Oreo Cheesecake!  Half off was nice and super unexpected!  My Salted Caramel Cheesecake slice tasted like the Ben and Jerrys Caramel Core ice cream!!! So good. A thick layer of caramel just coats the entire slice. Highly recommend if you love caramel! :) My boyfriends Oreo Cheesecake Slice was amazing. I'm not a huge chocolate person but he is and he was very impressed! Overall, not a bad experience for it being my first time! It was pleasurable, however I don't think I would make plans to eat here in the future, and in glad my meal was paid for with a gift card and not my own money, especially after a $9 beer.. But I don't think I would be against going again if someone else were to invite me."
Peg H.,"Sacramento, CA",8,36,100,5.0,10/30/2016,"You'll never go wrong with anything you order here. It's always delicious. Celebrating Alicia's 24th birthday today, for dinner. I loved the waitress who took care of us tonight, she's very attentive. Had one of my favorites tonight, ""Bang Bang Chicken & Shrimp""."
Amber G.,"Turlock, CA",25,6,21,5.0,9/8/2016,"Never go wrong with this place. Food, servers, and environment excellent. Loved how waitress was attentive and we did not lack anything for our meal: refill on drinks, bread..."
Tamara D.,"Sacramento, CA",100,7,1,5.0,4/8/2017,"My family frequents the Cheesecake Factory. We love the Louisiana Chicken Pasta and the Caesar salad never disappoints. Also, the dynamite shrimp, calamari and crab dip are all good choices for an appetizer. My favorite drink is the Peach smoothie. Yum! The portions are big and well worth the money you pay."
Jax B.,"Compton, CA",2,6,,1.0,4/8/2017,"This is by far the worst cheesecake factory I've ever been to. Other locations for the most part have been great. Here, I've had my food served overcooked and then I've been looked at sideways when I've complained. They also denied my voucher for a slice of cheesecake because it expired a few days ago which normally isnt a big deal. For this location, its further proof that they care absolutely nothing about customer satisfaction. Anyway, I'm never going here again."
Nicey S.,"Sacramento, CA",7,31,2,1.0,3/21/2017,On the 16th I came here with my niece and her friends for her birthday party and dinner everything was all bad food was cream out cold they completely got orders wrong and when I ask to speak to a manager the manager never came I just feel like since I put a lot of money into this restaurant every month that things could get better but I guess not it's always something but I can tell you to go because I love the food and I need more I won't be returning
Carrie D.,"Auburn, MI",0,8,,1.0,8/24/2017,"I've had good to great food at Cheesecake Factory before, but Saturday was not a good experience. Seated after a reasonable 10 min wait, but things headed downhill after that. No bread offered, but the couple next to me got bread without asking? Zucchini Spears warm but nearly raw inside.  My dish of Chicken Piccata was nearly dry, sauce enough for the chicken but not enough for the pasta. And the pasta was clumped together. I ordered my cheesecake to go, done with this.  Normally if anyone of these things happened during a meal I'd shrug my shoulders and give it a pass- but all these occurred in one meal. Overall very disappointed."
Brittany S.,"Sacramento, CA",3,34,20,2.0,3/26/2017,"The food is good, but the service at this particular location is subpar. The people at the host stand don't acknowledge their guests when their beepers go off. The guests just end up standing around for 5 minutes wondering what is going on and why their beeper vibrated. Also, the service from the waiters is just okay. I've been to this location on 4 or 5 occasions and the service has been the same each time. Also, was here on someone's birthday. We told the waiter of the birthday and asked if they did a song, they said yes. Then halfway through the meal the waiter changed. We told the new waiter of the birthday, but apparently they forgot. No song. I don't suggest going here unless you have a lot of time to wait and don't care about good service."
Jorge G.,"West Sacramento, CA",47,8,3,4.0,4/12/2016,"I took my daughter tonight. The calamari was great, the strawberry lemonade was great. Her crispy chicken sandwich was a little dry, ans I wasn't going bananas over my bacon bacon burger. The reason why I give it 4 stars instead of 3 comes down to the absolute gentleman who served us tonight. Jared was knowlegable, friendly and charasmatic. He let us know the specials and brought us out drinks quickly. My daughter has a really tough day and he made her smile and laugh every time he came to check on us.  Bravo Jared! Thanks for a great evening!! See you Mothers day!"
Billy A.,"Sacramento, CA",31,141,205,1.0,2/20/2017,"Was told 10 minute wait, 30 min later I was told it would be another 10 min. So we left, was looking forward to dinner with my family but decided to go elsewhere. While 30 min is. It a big deal, A more accurate wait time would have been nice."
Darren L.,"Sacramento, CA",0,14,4,4.0,3/22/2017,Always have a good time at the Cheesecake in Arden. Seating is usually quick and the bar height tables seem to always have space. Drinks are great and the Hibachi steak is cooked to perfection. Gave it 4 stars due to the waiter. Needs to find a new profession.
Corey Y.,"Sacramento, CA",1018,46,64,5.0,6/15/2016,"Great service from the Cheesecake Factory. The wait times last from 15 minutes to about an hour depending if they are busy or not. Some of their selections of food entree plates can be quite expensive so be prepared for a full course meal at about $20.  I ordered a root beer and after drinking it think it tasted funny, I told the waitress that the drink was flat having no carbon in it. Thankfully she came back with a new drink while they changed the drinks in the back for me.  I would come back again because of the great service they have. I am terrible with names but thank you to the waitress that helped me with that drink."
Frankie P.,"San Antonio, TX",117,12,4,1.0,3/1/2017,"Worst costumer service. I called to make an order for pick up the receptionist, put me on hold for some one to take my order. I remained on hold for 10 mins without receiving any notice that someone would be with me shortly. So I hung up and called back then talked to the receptionist about how I was on hold for a long time so what does she do to solve it? She puts me on hold for 7 mins until someone finally picked up the phone, then by this point I had no desire to eat there and explained to the guy that answered the phone how long I was on hold, then he proceeded to hang up on me."
Krystal T.,"Sacramento, CA",142,8,4,1.0,4/5/2017,"Went for my birthday. Service sucked didn't really come check on us. Food was very average but over priced. Won't be going back. Whole time I was there was wishing I went elsewhere, very over rated."
Caite L.,"Sacramento, CA",381,16,38,5.0,10/4/2016,"I usually go during Happy  Hour... The bartendar staff are friendly, helpful,  and entertaining. Tried the white linen this time for the first time. Really Tasty!!! I would recommend it to everyone who is adventurous."
Allysun S.,"Sacramento, CA",3,29,5,1.0,6/28/2016,I don't get this place. The food is a C- and the portions are embarrassingly enormous.  The restaurant is loud and crowded.  The waitress was nice.
Katie K.,"Downtown, Sacramento, CA",273,105,209,5.0,8/19/2014,"This review is specifically for today luncheon. But let me add, I've been to Cheesecake Factory many times and there wasn't a time I was ever dissatisfied. Food is always good especially the freshly baked wheat bread. YUMMY!!!!!! The restaurant is big and spacious. You can eat out in the patio. The restaurant is good for kids. It can get a bit loud; therefore I wouldn't come here for a nice quiet romantic dinner.  Today lunch was fantastic. I was completely satisfied with my visit. Our waitress was Kathy. She was friendly and fast. She refilled our water and bread in a timely manner.  I ordered the Salmon Genovese (lunch portion) and oh my gosh, it was superb. The sauce wasn't to heavy. It help add a little flavor to the salmon. The baked artichoke and sun dried tomatoes made the dish even more delicious. You have to try this dish. I already texted my gfs recommending them to order this dish at their next visit.  .... A continue return customer"
Grace B.,"Sacramento, CA",265,641,467,4.0,7/22/2014,"I havent been to Cheesecake Factory in years and I been to the one in San Francisco and not in Sacramento.  So I recally ordering simple stuff back then.  But today I ordered the Nacho appetizer.  What was really funny was that I didnt really think it was going to be large. When my appetizers came, it was so large I just had to share it with my friends.  It looked to me that my friends enjoyed their meals as well.  I also ordered the Chocolate Truffle Cheesecake to go.  It was really good as well. I guess I have to say that it's a great place to go to with family and friends.  The food comes out very large and the environment is really nice and clean too.  Great staff too."
