Jordan B.,"Sacramento, CA",0,1,,2.0,8/20/2017,"If you go here, please be advised, do not sit at the bar because thats literally all you'll be doing. This is not my first visit and each time I've been I sat at the bar and to my dismay the same results occur. I sit at the bar waiting for at least 15-20 minutes just to be acknowledged. It's one of my favorite places to eat but this location is just terrible when it comes to bar service."
Marcus M.,"Folsom, CA",403,266,399,5.0,9/26/2015,Cheesecake Factory never gets old! One of the top chain restaurants around in my opinion! The buffalo blasts are amazing! The bistro shrimp pasta never disappoints!
Nina Y.,"San Francisco, CA",671,1277,1718,3.0,4/24/2016,"This place is just okay. I mean it's like every other Cheesecake factory I've been to.  Just like every Cheesecake factory - the honey wheat bread is amazing (that's the brown one by the way). I think it's almost everyone's favorite. We did ask for warm bread - like ones right out of the oven, but we didn't get any. Not like that at least.  We ended up sharing the crab cake appetizer. There was 3 crab cakes but for 4 of us. We shared which is nice. I ended up getting the salmon with mashed potatoes and broccoli. It's always a delicious dish and I really enjoy it. The grilled salmon and broccoli made me feel like I wasn't gorging myself on a million calories even if I was.  We ended up sharing the salted caramel cheesecake for dessert. To be honest, the salted caramel wasn't salty enough - if that makes any sense at all. It was just okay.  Protip: warm honey wheat bread."
Nedra P.,"Vacaville, CA",396,49,19,5.0,11/11/2016,"I came in on Veteran's Day, the parking lot was hell as usual, and I was here at 3pm. I sat at the bar, where a nice bartender named Tim promptly placed my order. I asked for a nice, strong drink, he suggested a Mai Tai, and boy, it didn't disappoint. It looks like he's new, and being trained by a lead bartender (named Alex, who is doing a wonderful job of training.), yet he was still very attentive. I will finish my review once my get my food.. So, I got my appetizer, the egg roll sampler. I subbed the avocado rolls for some other roll, and it came out fresh and crisp, tasted hella good, compliments my drink exponentially. Loved the dipping sauces, as they give you four different ones.  I ordered the fish and chips...the eggrolls did a delicious number on my stomach, so I delved into the hot, crisp fish and tasty French fries that I ended up taking home. Thank you, Tim and Alex, for a pleasurable lunch!!!"
Aaron L.,"Sacramento, CA",44,54,19,5.0,8/6/2016,"I had the fish tacos with the panko batter.  The tacos had pickled cabbage and a nice flavored white sauce.  Also, the strawberry-lemonade is always refreshing.  I know Cheesecake Factory is a chain restaurant, but the variety and taste always brings us back.  Good service too!"
Sergio R.,"Elk Grove, CA",17,2,,2.0,3/5/2017,"Just left the The Cheesecake Factory on Arden Way, Sacrsmento CA, very disappointed in service and the food. We never received our appetizer to start, my pasta dish was on the sweet side, and My wife's grilled salmon has pin bones. I would have complained to my waitress sooner, but she was no where to be found. My worst experience ever with this franchise. So much for my birthday dinner, I didn't even want to chance waiting for a piece of cheesecake"
Kai R.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",620,495,966,1.0,10/11/2016,"Sadly, our visit on Friday 10/07/16 ended on a pretty sad note...  Dinner was fine, as in no hiccups or ruined meals, but the food was just okay.  We were in town for a conference... me from the Bay Area, mom from 3 hours up North, & my sister who's local-ish.  I had the Almond Crusted Salmon over Kale Salad which was missing the salad dressing--  no biggie, didn't need the calories anyway.  My mom had the Skinnylicious Enchiladas Plate-- not sure why she would order Mexican food here, but she said it was okay.  My sister had the Avacado Egg Rolls--  she didn't finish them so I can only assume they weren't ""the best she ever had.""  I tasted a piece & thought they were good.  Our server was really nice.  Overall, dinner was 3 stars, pretty average chain-restaurant experience.   As we were leaving, I decided to order 3 slices of cheesecake to-go.  We got to our hotel room looking forward to tasting them, but unfortunately THEY WERE FROZEN!!  Like biting into ice cream FROZEN!  Not sure why they didn't just tell us, hey these are frozen so wait a bit to eat them.  No one said a word!  I mean, had I ordered this to our table, I'm sure they would have brought me a thawed piece of cheesecake, omg!!   Anyway, after paying $8 per slice, we had to put them in the hotel  room fridge until morning... then we had to checkout & be at day 2 of the conference from 7am - noon...  yeah, didn't really get to enjoy that $25 + tip of cheesecake!  So I decided to call a mgr to let them know about the cheesecake mishap...   I spoke with Diana...  she claimed to be the mgr.  She listened & explained ""see what had happened was...""  yada yada, someone dropped the ball.  She agreed that we shouldn't have been served frozen cheesecake  (""deeply chilled"" as she called it).  She concluded with an apology & a thank you for coming in & thanks for bringing it our attention so that next time--- uuhh, NO hun, there will not be a next time since you clearly do not value or respect your customers.  I wasn't looking for a freebie; I was hoping she would be interested in rectifying the wrong.  For now, I refuse to waste my time, energy, or finances on *hoping* for a better outcome next time...  especially after basically thanking me for throwing $30 of your cheesecake into the conference hall trashcan, haha!  Sorry, but no.  If this is any indication of her mgmt style, then I understand how we were served frozen cheesecake.  Too bad I didn't stop by after the conference to return the ruined cheesecake!  Guess Diana would have preferred that I FURTHER inconvenience myself by driving out of my way."
Noelle Y.,"Sacramento, CA",201,150,4016,2.0,8/21/2015,"The wait for the food is outrageous and our server Ryan is horrible. He gave us an attitude and barely gave us any service. He didn't seem like he wanted to be here. He told us that the food would be out quickly but it seem like he forgot to put the food in. It's okay if he forgot, I just don't like his attitude that he give us as if he didn't care to serve us. Everyone around us that was seated after us got their food before we did and they were already finished before we got our food. Avoid if your server is Ryan. He has a horrible customer service attitude."
Maxim B.,"Sacramento, CA",0,12,,5.0,3/23/2017,"Logged on to leave this review because I was so very impressed by our server Veronica tonight (3/23). She was nothing but terrific: so friendly and cheerful, helpful in navigating the menu and making informed decisions, attentive and exceptionally accommodating. I wanted to combine select ingredients from two different price-equivalent dishes into one to my liking and Veronica took care of that for me. I was very happy to get precisely what I wanted even though it was not on the menu. I think Veronica has a great future whatever she decides to do - she's got an admirable attitude! The food was very good. My company and I enjoyed our entrees a great deal: shepherds pie and herb crusted salmon. The dessert was delicious as well.  This dinner far surpassed my expectations."
Xandra B.,"Sacramento, CA",117,9,6,2.0,3/3/2017,I think the service was good but I hated the seating and the food was half decent. Me and mt fiancé dont really eat out a lot since i rather cook... but I feel like I've had way better but that's just me. I will not returning back there to eat & sit in the restaurant. Maybe I'll try calling an order in one day and see what I think... or not...
Kim A.,"Sacramento, CA",0,9,3,5.0,3/3/2017,I have been here many of time noon amd night and to be here at the one of the busiest times (lunch time) and have a waitress name Kim P.  be the outstanding waitress she was to me and my mom was absolutely awesome. She served us everything in a timely manner and never let our drinks get down to half a glass lol. Food is always good but the customer service always makes it better KUDOS to hiring her Cheesecake factory
Tony S.,"Laguna Beach, CA",0,43,25,1.0,6/7/2017,"Went in on Monday for Happy Hour around 4:20pm, sat at the high top tables  in the bar area, me and my wife waited at least 10 minutes non of the servers knowledged us, was not that busy, then I decided to order from the Bartender 1st initial M. She quickly insisted we have a server, I said non came by and would like to order right now, she stated then I would have to close the check with her, I said that was fine. It appeared she was more worried about where I was going close my check and tip than providing us with quick and friendly service. Then when I picked up my drinks and walked to my table a server pulls up, I told him we already ordered our drinks and fpod with the bartender, he said nice and continue to serve us, was very nice. Later after waiting and waiting I had to ask Bartender M. To check on our food, then after more wait someone else brought our food. At end when I approached the Bartender M. To close my check she said we have to close with the server. Cheese Cake Factory your service is going down the drain."
Liana B.,"Sacramento, CA",231,266,965,4.0,7/26/2015,"I don't think I've eaten here for over a year! With that being said, I was very excited when my friend suggested this place.  I started with the fried portobello mushrooms, avocados, and zucchini fries as my appetizer ($6.95), and OH MY GOODNESS -- it was so freakin' delicious. My friends also ordered and shared the calamari ($11.95) and onion rings (not sure of the price), which were both fried perfectly.  For my entree, I had the herb crusted salmon filet, which was served with asparagus and mashed potatoes on top of a cream lemon sauce. It was very light and tasty; I enjoyed it thoroughly. My group seemed to be content with their meals as well. And of course we had to order cheesecake! We ordered: white chocolate caramel macadamia nut, the anniversary chocolate, and the strawberry. The best one was the strawberry, but I like plain flavors lol. The white chocolate caramel was too sweet. As soon as we scraped the parts of the cake that had chunks of caramel, however, it was more palatable for me. The chocolate was just okay for me -- very chocolate-ly, so it would be perfect for chocolate lovers.  Our waitress was super sweet and friendly, making this dining experience with friends even more enjoyable. You will definitely see me here more than once a year from now on (:"
Yolanda S.,"Auburn, CA",15,9,1,5.0,2/2/2017,We eat here often. Their food is consistently delicious! My favorite entre is the Miso Salmon. Their Small Plates are all so good as well.
Jamie S.,"Sacramento, CA",111,237,85,3.0,7/10/2016,"What can I say about Cheesecake Factory? If you want to overeat on some ""meh"" food but don't have the patience for waiting for a table at Olive Garden, come here.  However, it IS possible to eat a normal portion and not waddle away...you just have to order an appetizer as your main course. The appetizers here are the size of a large-ish normal meal. The only downside is at you have to endure the waitress treating you like a total cheapskate. I'm not a cheapskate, lady, I just don't want to be eating the same leftovers for a week.  The cheesecake itself is ok, but not really great in terms of flavor. They insist on offering about 40 varieties of EVERY category (from salad to pasta to dessert) but they don't really do anything particularly well.  They literally have so many entrees available that I don't remember any of them clearly, so if a friend suggests we go to Cheesecake Factory, I think ""yeah, I guess they're ok.."" I just remember that is wasn't terrible, so I keep agreeing to go back. Maybe that's how they lure people into coming back - everyone just remembers that it wasn't bad."
Erica D.,"Sacramento, CA",0,18,11,5.0,1/16/2016,"Wow is all I would say if I could but I must elaberate a little. The wait time was no problem they said 45 minutes so we went to Toysrus to waste some time, our table was done before that so we came back. We had a nice corner spot to accomidate our table of 9.  Service- Our server was so polite just a very nice person and so attentive and right on every point! We didn't have to wait for anything he was always right there, if he had to come back he would explain really quick that he would be back in one minute, he was very attentive to all his tables and let me tell you this place was packed wall to wall. Drinks- We ordered a few Shirly Temples and water and they came right away no wait time at all. Appetizer- We got the Fried Mozzarella. It came out nicely plated, golden brown, crispy, hot, cheese fully melted and served with Marinara Sauce. Very delicious! I want more just thinking about it. Food- I ordered the Grilled Chicken & Avacado Club. All their food was big portions so you won't be leaving there hungry. My Club Sandwich was the best I ever had. Nice juicy grilled chicken breast, bacon, lettuce, tomatoe and avacado on golden brown grilled bread. Oh so good I'm still snacking on the other half. You can have salad or fries I got the salad with blue cheese dressing.  Dessert- I got the cheese cake topped with cherries and whipped cream that was really good but I already knew it was going to be.  The restaraunt is gorgeous inside from wall decor, paintings on the ceilings and statues, seating area is very nice, the bar is huge and I like how they place the alcohol up the wall to almost the ceiling. I'm impressed I haven't been to a restaraunt in years where it was all around satisfying....  just amazing. Thank you to our waiter for the outstanding service and the chefs and cooks that took  such great pride in their cooking which is hard to find now days. Thanks The Cheese Cake Factory!"
Michelle M.,"Sacramento, CA",228,602,2721,4.0,6/19/2015,"Brought the family here for graduation dinner seating for 9 and service was excellent and quick service. Our waiter was very nice and on top of our orders, refilling our drinks and quick with suggestions for dessert. I forgot her name but she had great customer service and food off the skinny menu tastes marvelous !!!"
Nicole H.,"Temple City, CA",8,39,37,2.0,4/21/2016,"Being that this was the first time I had ever eaten at a Cheesecake Factory, our experience wasn't the best. We've all heard that the Cheesecake Factory is an excellent place to eat at and the food is super delicious. But my hubby and i's experience really tells a different story.  My hubby and I got to the restaurant at around dinner time, but we were seated rather quickly. We were given our complimentary bread and butter quickly, along with our drinks, which we decided to have just water.  Our waiter was really nice and quick at getting our orders down, without much deciding I decided to order the chicken bellagio while my husband decided to get the Kobe beef burger FIRST. The waiter left with our orders, but with some more deciding he decided to go with the fried mac and cheese burger (medium rare). He chased down the waiter and asked for a change, which our waiter did right away.  The wait for the food was sort of long, but we weren't upset because we had already expected the wait and we had our bread to munch on while we waited. My husbands food came out first, and then mine took a little while to come out after.  At first bite I wasn't too satisfied with the pasta, it was sort of dry and all stuck together, it didn't seem like it was fresh or that it was heated up all the way. My husband was also not satisfied with his burger, being super picky with his burgers, this one was cooked very well done, but he asked for it to be medium rare. We sent the burger back, but not the pasta because I'm less picky than he is.  The new burger was taking sort of long, but I think our waiter sensed that we were getting irritated because he offered us some soup. He also kept us updated on the burger and how much more we had to wait on it.  When his second burger finally came out though, it was perfect. Although on the negative side, we were both so full from the fries and soup and bread that we couldn't even finish our foods. I ended up eating only half of the portion that was on my plate. And my husband also ate just half of his burger. We ended up deciding to take it all to go, but I was displeased that our food wasn't boxed for us, and that we had to do it ourselves.  Overall our experience at the Cheesecake Factory was not such a pleasing one. Our food took forever to come, it wasn't fresh, we had to send one plate back, the wait was forever and in the end, we didn't even feel like trying some of their cheesecake. But if you guys ever do need somewhere fancy to take your family or friends, the Cheesecake Factory may be a good option, because I've heard that in Asia mostly, this placed is very well known. :^)"
Doug G.,"Lincoln, CA",242,268,356,3.0,10/25/2015,Ahi Tuna Tartar was very good. Lettuce chicken wraps only so-so. Wraps lacked flavor. Chicken salad sandwich had a little too much bread. Wait service was great.
Mariel I.,"Elk Grove, CA",68,160,381,4.0,4/2/2016,I went here last night and ordered the Louisiana Chicken Pasta which was pretty good. I have no complaints. I definitely loved the chicken though. I ordered the hibiscus lemonade and omg it was Amazingly delicious! I loved it!! For dessert I ordered the dulce de leche Cheesecake and I really loved it! I really don't like how dark it is in the restaurant it's a little hard to read the menu. The ambiance was nice. Service was ok the guy could've been a bit friendlier. But it is a must try. Definitely try the hibiscus lemonade and dulce de leche cheesecake.

Drinks- We ordered a few Shirly Temples and water and they came right away no wait time at all. Appetizer- We got the Fried Mozzarella. It came out nicely plated, golden brown, crispy, hot, cheese fully melted and served with Marinara Sauce. Very delicious! I want more just thinking about it. Food- I ordered the Grilled Chicken & Avacado Club. All their food was big portions so you won't be leaving there hungry. My Club Sandwich was the best I ever had. Nice juicy grilled chicken breast, bacon, lettuce, tomatoe and avacado on golden brown grilled bread. Oh so good I'm still snacking on the other half. You can have salad or fries I got the salad with blue cheese dressing.  Dessert- I got the cheese cake topped with cherries and whipped cream that was really good but I already knew it was going to be.  The restaraunt is gorgeous inside from wall decor, paintings on the ceilings and statues, seating area is very nice, the bar is huge and I like how they place the alcohol up the wall to almost the ceiling. I'm impressed I haven't been to a restaraunt in years where it was all around satisfying....  just amazing. Thank you to our waiter for the outstanding service and the chefs and cooks that took  such great pride in their cooking which is hard to find now days. Thanks The Cheese Cake Factory!"

We've all heard that the Cheesecake Factory is an excellent place to eat at and the food is super delicious. But my hubby and i's experience really tells a different story.  My hubby and I got to the restaurant at around dinner time, but we were seated rather quickly. We were given our complimentary bread and butter quickly, along with our drinks, which we decided to have just water.  Our waiter was really nice and quick at getting our orders down, without much deciding I decided to order the chicken bellagio while my husband decided to get the Kobe beef burger FIRST. The waiter left with our orders, but with some more deciding he decided to go with the fried mac and cheese burger (medium rare). He chased down the waiter and asked for a change, which our waiter did right away.  The wait for the food was sort of long, but we weren't upset because we had already expected the wait and we had our bread to munch on while we waited. My husbands food came out first, and then mine took a little while to come out after.  At first bite I wasn't too satisfied with the pasta, it was sort of dry and all stuck together, it didn't seem like it was fresh or that it was heated up all the way. My husband was also not satisfied with his burger, being super picky with his burgers, this one was cooked very well done, but he asked for it to be medium rare. We sent the burger back, but not the pasta because I'm less picky than he is.  The new burger was taking sort of long, but I think our waiter sensed that we were getting irritated because he offered us some soup. He also kept us updated on the burger and how much more we had to wait on it.  When his second burger finally came out though, it was perfect. Although on the negative side, we were both so full from the fries and soup and bread that we couldn't even finish our foods. I ended up eating only half of the portion that was on my plate. And my husband also ate just half of his burger. We ended up deciding to take it all to go, but I was displeased that our food wasn't boxed for us, and that we had to do it ourselves.  Overall our experience at the Cheesecake Factory was not such a pleasing one. Our food took forever to come, it wasn't fresh, we had to send one plate back, the wait was forever and in the end, we didn't even feel like trying some of their cheesecake. But if you guys ever do need somewhere fancy to take your family or friends, the Cheesecake Factory may be a good option, because I've heard that in Asia mostly, this placed is very well known. :^)"
Doug G.,"Lincoln, United States",242,268,356,3.0,25/10/2015,Ahi Tuna Tartar was very good. Lettuce chicken wraps only so-so. Wraps lacked flavor. Chicken salad sandwich had a little too much bread. Wait service was great.
Mariel I.,"Elk Grove, United States",68,160,381,4.0,2/4/2016,I went here last night and ordered the Louisiana Chicken Pasta which was pretty good. I have no complaints. I definitely loved the chicken though. I ordered the hibiscus lemonade and omg it was Amazingly delicious! I loved it!! For dessert I ordered the dulce de leche Cheesecake and I really loved it! I really don't like how dark it is in the restaurant it's a little hard to read the menu. The ambiance was nice. Service was ok the guy could've been a bit friendlier. But it is a must try. Definitely try the hibiscus lemonade and dulce de leche cheesecake.
