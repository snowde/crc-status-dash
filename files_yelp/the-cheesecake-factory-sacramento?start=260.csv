Cassie S.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",0,3,,1.0,1/23/2017,"Worst place to get to go food, I've ordered to go three different times from this location and each time it's been a nightmare. Better off going to grab to go food else where, food just isn't the same as when you dine in"
Nhi T.,"San Jose, CA",190,37,23,2.0,4/16/2016,"My sibs and I love having an occasional dinner at the Cheesecake Factory. We don't come often but normally the service is good. Friendly people who do a nice job at serving and meeting our needs. I.  Last night, we went as a party of 8 around 920PM. 5 adults and 3 kids. Waited about 30 minutes for a table. Our server was a man named Timothy. We got seated and he took our drink orders as well as our food orders. Since we were a party of 8, our table was really long. Timothy stood on one end of the table trying to take my sister's order (who was sitting on the other end), and she was literally yelling over the background chatter of the restaurant. He finally walks over to that side of the table to take their orders. Shouldn't it be common sense to move to the other end so people aren't shouting across the table?  Anyway, Tried to order my usual dish (chicken chipotle pasta with their Louisiana chicken instead of the honey glazed chicken) but he insisted that they don't allow the substitution at all because it's ""two completely different dishes"". I gave up, I didn't want to waste breath over a chicken substitution so I just ordered it regular. But we requested for the 3 kids meals to be prepared first and brought out as soon as they were done.  When he brought out the drinks, one of the cups knocked over and spilled all over the table. Our waiter said he'd be back with a towel to wipe it off. 10mins pass and we made do with cleaning the spill with our own napkins. A table busser comes to clean the table NEXT to ours. Our waiter talks to the busser and they come over to our table to address the spill (that we cleaned ourselves 10mins ago). We told them we didn't need cleaning anymore. Fast forward to 10:30pm. No food in sight yet. No appetizers or kids food. Kids were getting sleepy waiting and munching on the complimentary bread.  10:40. Food finally arrives and all of the food came out at once. One of the kids ordered a cheese quesadilla but they made a chicken quesadilla. He was hungry so I didn't want to hassle our server in correcting the order since food took so long to come out in the first place. The food tasted good as it normally did. Our waiter never brought us paper napkins that we requested. And when it was time for the food boxing (past experiences, my waiters have 100% always brought the good back to be packed and brought it back to our table) he gave us 5 boxes to do it ourselves, and only one small bag. I don't know what the logic in that was.  Overall it was the worse service we've ever had here and we've been going occasionally for as long as I can remember. Really sad and I hope no one has a bad experience as this one!"
Marlene T.,"Fair Oaks, CA",1,11,2,4.0,2/27/2017,"I really enjoy this restaurant.  I have generally come here when I can't decide where we should go out for the evening and I can select from the many options their menu provides.  The atmosphere is generally a little noisy but nothing unexpectedly loud for a large restaurant chain.  The most recent visit I had, there was a man who was not a customer that was making his way through the restaurant yelling some nonsense no one could understand and the staff quickly removed him.  Although the staff handled the situation well, it is a testament to the type of neighborhood this particular restaurant is located in."
Damaris M.,"Sacramento, CA",11,79,592,5.0,4/14/2016,"Food was great, the server was too slow...we had to keep flagging her down. U put up some pictures of our drinks. My favorite one is the cosmopolitan which was firm which is my favow."
Dylan R.,"Gallatin, TN",0,2,,1.0,8/6/2017,"I'm at work and ordered with a group of 8 people. I got the mac and cheese burger for delivery, but it showed up with no mac and cheese!  And the patty was very pink (I like my meat rare, but this looked food poisoning rare). Over half of out orders were wrong. I would not recommend this place to anyone."
Terie S.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",0,6,,1.0,8/5/2017,I just had the absolute worse spinach mushroom omelette. It was a really bad experience. Wont be going back.
Bill R.,"Sacramento, CA",23,154,,1.0,6/30/2015,"The couple of times I've been to TCF in other cities it was outstanding; this was quite the opposite. I came into here late one Monday. Place was clean and welcoming, but it was FREEZING inside. Just because it's hot outside doesn't mean it should be the exact opposite inside folks.  My margarita tasted like a big glass of overly sweetened lemonade. The tossed salad had several very bitter pieces of lettuce; I didn't even finish it. The main entree of herb crusted salmon with mashed potatoes, and asparagus was very disappointing. To start with the presentation (not that I care so much about that) looked like the Facehugger alien from the movie ""Alien.""  A big piece of black salmon over the mashed potatoes with long, green asparagus sprouting out like tentacles. I told the server the presentation was BIZARRE.  Food-wise, the dish was not as hot as it should have been (Why won't restaurants learn that details count?!). The salmon was almost black from the herbs. The asparagus was too big (asparagus should be thin and slightly crunchy, not big and mushy). And they put some kind of cream sauce with it all (??). Why we'd need a cream sauce I don't know.  Entire bill with 15% tip (service was good), $46!!!! Yeah. All it takes is one bad experience the first time a customer comes in the door and they will NEVER be back."
Angel C.,"Modesto, CA",57,36,245,4.0,3/12/2016,"Let me start off by saying I am very much a fan of this restaurant,  the people waiting patiently oblong the entrance for seats speaks volumes of the great service and food.  Wait time today was 20 minutes so not too bad for a Saturday lunch.  Spent the day with my sister in law, my brother and infant son. Table count:4. The positive. As I mentioned the wait was reasonable and the young man at front was very polite and courteous.  Our food consisted of a salad, the salmon dish and a shepherds pie for yours truly.  Each and every dish was impeccable, tasty and worth every bite.  I like to think that a good dish means less to take home.  We did not need any boxing today. The unfortunate:  I understand completely packed restaurants and hundreds of seated patrons with dozens more on the wings waiting patiently.  But table service was not what I had hoped at today at The Cheesecake Factory.  The water came out fine and in a few minutes,  we had to ask then wait over 10 minutes for the first batch of bread which has three loaves and was ok.  20 minutes later no follow up service and we had to ask for more bread which only brought 2 loaves and was more stale than a piece of croutons. The last positive was the drinks, pineapple Mojito's and typhoon punches.  Definitely hats off to the bartender.  Kind of made up for other aspects.   This is I think was a one off I generally have great experiences.  HAPPY DINING Yelpers."
Jay C.,"Lodi, CA",0,18,30,5.0,2/24/2017,"We went here for my birthday dinner. My guy, my kid and me... it was all of our first time to this franchise. It was really nice. The appearance was beautiful. The food tasted so good. Everyone was happy with their food. The menu was huge!!! I had no idea. Cheesecake was amazing!!!!! If I lived closer, I'd be in so much trouble!!!! The service was great, fast. I would love to go back."
Debbie A.,"Stockton, CA",0,3,1,1.0,2/23/2017,"This place was very clean, and waitress was nice. I usually love this restaurant in other cities, but this restaurant was horrible. My food was burned and when I brought it to my servers attention she didn't seem bothered by it. She came back about 3 minutes later with a small plate and said her manager wanted to her to remove the burned food from my plate. They didn't offer me a new plate, just to bring me a few pieces of sausage. Then they said they would take off a cheesecake off my bill, but did not. We spent $73 that day for 2 people, and they didn't care about the food they served me. I suggest this restaurant in other cities, but stay away from this one."
JAMAAL L.,"Carmichael, CA",0,14,93,4.0,7/21/2016,"Steak Diane + Long Island + Original Cheesecake = Happiness  Cant go wrong.. Pretty good waiters when we go, its just the initial wait upon arriving.  Other than that always had a good experience."
Lynn S.,"Sacramento, CA",6,14,,1.0,2/22/2017,"I must say I was a bit disappointed in the Cheesecake Factory Went there for lunch for my birthday, we ordered the cream cheese wontons for an appitizer, when they came they looked very yummy. Then I ate one OMG who puts mustard in a crab Rangoon wonton. I guess they do I don't eat mustard. Even the other people with me could not believe it was mixed up with mustard. I ordered a salad that was suppose to have chicken. They either forgot it or maybe a Chinese chicken salad doesn't have chicken. Don't think I will return. Kudos for the cheesecake it was good. Guess if you call your restaurant the Cheesecake Factory it better be good"
Jennifer G.,"Sacramento, CA",29,5,,1.0,2/1/2017,I get sick every once in a while. A cold here and there. But I haven't thrown up in years!! Years!! My boyfriend and I decided to come here and eat. I had some pot stickers and went home. Everything went well and the server was really friendly. At five AM it hit me and my stomach was in pain. I threw up and broke my six year streak  this hasn't happened before with pot stickers that I eat from other places. I'm not sure why it happened here. Not prepared right? Maybe it didn't agree with me? I'm not sure but I don't want to come back for a long time.
David T.,"Sacramento, CA",128,12,19,4.0,12/24/2015,"I came here very often but never made a review about it and it's time to do so. So, I came here on a Wednesday afternoon and had no wait so that was a plus. We got seated right away and our waitress greeted us quickly asking what we wanted to drink and any snacks to get started. The customer service was good! And of course, I got the crispy chicken costeletta. It was super delicious but they didn't provide much sauce this time around so I had to ask for it. Wasn't bad, but need a tad more sauce. Other than that, it would have been 5/5.  Overall, I enjoyed the environment and customer service. Our waitress kept on coming back asking if we needed anything and also kept us satisfied. I enjoyed it!"
Steve M.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,9,,1.0,7/23/2017,"Hit or miss, tonight a miss. Ordered a rib eye, and they bring me New York steak, my friend heard me order Rib eye.  By the time the correct food came, my friend had completely finished his meal. Nobody ever came by with an update or even an offer to refill our bread. And the Rib Eye was dry and bland, with no offer of steak sauce. All they gave me was a free slice of Cheesecake and an apology, turning down my suggestion that both of us get one free, saying we can ""split it'. My friend didn't enjoy eating his meal while I'm sitting there with nothing. Mistakes happen but poor service has no excuse. I don't know if I'll go back."
Rachelle M.,"San Francisco, CA",0,11,5,5.0,7/31/2016,"Kevin our server for the night 07/30/16 was the best server ever!!!

Alyssa Mae C.,"Sacramento, CA",33,249,35,5.0,6/18/2015,"Warm honey wheat bread and butter is fan-friggin-tastic. Louisiana Chicken Pasta is also fan-friggin-tastic.   You can't go wrong with any of their cheesecakes because it's, like, a factory, duh, which makes it a particular term by default... Oh yeah: fan-friggin-tastic. I'll stop now :) Have a nice day."
Tory M.,"Chico, CA",75,142,135,5.0,7/17/2016,Amazing pasta!!! Everything is amazing and creamy and delicious! I have never been truly disappointed at the Cheesecake Factory. I didn't love my egg roll sampler because I didn't think it was big enough and the avocado one was literally just avocado (I mean that's a little weird even for me and I love avocado) but even though that wasn't a home run I absolutely loved my Long Island! Sweet but not too sweet and it came with a punch! The cheesecake I had (raspberry of some kind) was amazing! I totally recommended any pasta dish! (That's where I went wrong!! Never stray) it's all good!  Always up for it again
