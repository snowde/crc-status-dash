Luann L.,"Big Lake, MN",3,28,5,5.0,7/30/2017,After a bad start had great service great food and awesome cheesecake good place to go
N N.,"Sacramento, CA",0,1,2,1.0,1/10/2017,"I called in my order, in which I was told it would be ready in15 min. I came in and was told it would be 10 min. That was fine since I just called in. 36 mi later I ask another gentle (not the original guy) Can you check on my food. He looked puzzled and said what did u order. Come to find out my food was sitting on the counter for over 20 min. He apologized and I said it's not your fault, but I haven't moved, was brought water, and was the only person in there. After talking to his pier he offered to remake my two orders and give me a free piece of cheesecake. I was exhausted from driving from SFO in horrible  weather. When I got home I couldn't even eat my food. It was dry with huge hard pieces of Italian sausage.  I order this dish all the time and it was clear no care was taken in preparing this dish. Now my husband is on his way back to return my dish in again this horrible weather. I am so disappointed and probably won't eat the dish because now I have no appetite.  Smh@you cheesecake factory. Well second round was just as bad with burnt pieces of Italian sausage all through the dish making it crunchy and disgusting.....sigh. money down the drain"
Camille A.,"Milpitas, CA",0,5,,1.0,7/12/2017,I just called twice for catering. They picked up the phone and hung up immediately on both times. Guess they don't want our business
Steve H.,"Elk Grove, CA",61,63,92,4.0,4/28/2016,"Great restaurant to eat with any size party. The prices are very expensive so be wary of it before you go here. Make sure your friends know ahead too. But besides that, there was amazing service and my waiter was always on top of everything. I got the cashew chicken, the chicken was crispy as can be but they definitely put too much sauce on the rice. Overall a great experience and will come back."
Kati C.,"North Highlands, CA",26,96,19,1.0,7/8/2017,"called in my order for pickup....asked for chicken madera and chicken fettuccini Alfredo....my chicken madera was BURNED on one piece (they made sure to put the burnt side down) and zero sear/color on the other (making it slimy) whole thing tasted burnt bcuz of it....very disappointed for paying $50 take out. asked for extra bread and butter, Antonio was the guys name, said sure and then when it wasnt in the bag we asked again and he seemed annoyed to actually have to keep his word."
Calloway C.,"Sacramento, CA",22,108,365,2.0,3/3/2016,Not impressed this visit.  Wait time for food was extremely long and upon arrival it was not very good. Next time we will just come for desert!
Sukradevi I.,"Carmichael, CA",35,12,4,1.0,1/20/2017,"The food so sub par unless you want a salt attack. Pricey for what you get. Bartender good, kitchen not so much. Sacramento is far better than this as a food culture."
Brittney K.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",381,163,1298,2.0,3/24/2014,"Not sure if our waiter was new or what, but the service was especially disappointing. For how surprisingly busy it was at 2pm, we were seated at a booth very quickly, but it only went downhill from there. Once our waiter took our orders, it was almost an hour of sitting there without ANY food before he came to tell us that the kitchen overcooked my boyfriend's burger and had to redo it. He offered us soup or salad while we were waiting, but didn't mention it if was complementary or not...so we declined. Once our food finally came, we practically inhaled it because we had been waiting so long. We were reluctant to stay longer, but the reason we had come in the first place was to redeem free cheesecake slices, so we ordered a slice of pineapple upside down cheesecake. Even that took a while to come, considering how the front cheesecake counter has slices on plates ready to go for the waiters. Once that plate was cleared, we waited for our check. And waited. Our waiter was nowhere in sight, not even at his other tables nearby. Finally, I flagged him down and asked for the check. After TWO hours at The Cheesecake Factory, when all we had wanted was a simple late lunch/linner, we were more than ready to leave. The saving grace of this experience was the cheesecake. The pineapple upside down cheesecake and the chocolate tuxedo cheesecake we ordered to-go were delicious. In the future, would probably only come here again for cheesecake."
Suzanne Q.,"Lodi, CA",57,279,799,4.0,4/25/2014,"I have been here many times, usually stopping in for a bite to eat after hitting the mall next door.  Cheesecake Factory is usually a hit for me. Great selection on their huge menu and a nice variety of items. I love the small bites section- great to share a bunch of small items with a group or if you want to save a couple bucks.  Service is always on point; you're never left with an empty drink or waiting on your food. And of course, don't forget to get a yummy piece of cheesecake to go for later:)"
Matilda R.,"Redding, CA",0,14,3,5.0,7/17/2017,"I love this place!  I've been twice now and both times the food has been so good.  We just went yesterday around 4:30 and there was no wait whatsoever.  We sat at a high table in the bar and the service was excellent.  Our waiter was great and we were served quickly.  My husband had the Steak Diane with the scampi and I had some sort of chicken dish with mozzarella and mushrooms and both meals were outstanding.  It was my husband's first time at Cheesecake Factory and he said it was his new favorite place to eat.  We managed to save some room for cheesecake and it was delicious!  We couldn't decide so we ordered three kinds to sample - the carrot cake cheesecake, the s'mores cheesecake and the Godiva chocolate and they were all so good.  We live out of the area, but I can't wait to come back to try more cheesecake!  Hands down my favorite restaurant."
Tabassum L.,"Sacramento, CA",4,66,,2.0,5/30/2016,"I have been coming here for years and have brought in different people with me to try this place out who in return have came back and brought other people with them to try it out.   My favorite has always been the  Four Cheese Pasta with a Side of Mashed Potatoes. In the past I have also tried the Salmon, about twice, and each time have gotten sick off of it which is weird because I'm fine with home cooked Salmon. I used to love the food here and the people but I feel like, slowly, not only has their staff changed but so has the food.  The past few times that I came in the food has tasted a little bland. I feel like coming in here now is a waste of money because I can make the same stuff @ home and have it taste much better.  Not only that, I haven't been very happy with service lately either. The last time I came in here was last year with my older sister and a friend. Our friend had asked the waiter what kind of virgin margarita he would offer and his response was whatever looks good to you, he never once asked us if we wanted a refill on our drinks, he would pass by our table or act like he was coming towards it and instantly change directions, he took our friends glass and got her a refill without asking her if she wanted another refill,  when it was my turn to order he looked at me and nodded his head at me to order instead of using words like a normal person, we finally requested for another waiter and ended up getting a Complimentary Dessert out of it.  I don't know if the training at this Cheesecake Factory Location is not properly given or if the Managers just don't care how their servers act but something gotta change!  Needless to say I haven't been here since"
Angelo V.,"Sacramento, CA",8,21,14,1.0,12/9/2016,"My wife and I sat at the bar and it took us 20 minutes to get a water. Other people sat down after us and were served first with water, bread, and a menu. I then asked for a menu and that took 10 minutes to get when other people next to us are already ordering their food. We were over looked a handful of times. And then I ordered and beer which took 5 minutes. It was one of the worst experiences I have ever felt eating out, and believe me...we go on dates alot and try new restaurants on a regular. Sad to say, we will never go back their again because of how we were treated."
Joe M.,"Woodland, CA",70,142,288,4.0,3/15/2015,"So After hearing some good things about this place I decided to give this place a shot. Me and girlfriend went on a Saturday afternoon and boy was it packed. Also a 30 minute wait just for us two. This place doesn't have pagers, they text you when your table is ready. So we wait and eventually get a table. Our waitress was friendly. The menu is pretty big as it has everything from pizza to pasta and burgers. I decided on the stuffed mushrooms for a snack and my entree the pepperoni pizza. My Gf got a pasta dish that I can't quite remember the name. Everything was good that we ordered. Pizza was a bit on the thin side but they loaded it with lots of cheese :-)  oh and they bring out bread while you wait for your food. Overall a pleasant experience. Some things on the menu can get on the pricey side. Definitely will be coming back but maybe on a weekday next time."
Marie Jane L.,"Fair Oaks, CA",0,12,6,2.0,6/9/2016,"First of all the service was amazing BUT the problem is the food. We came in to celebrate my sister's graduation. I ordered Shrimp and Chicken Gumbo but it was nasty. It was bitter, the onions were black and the sauce was really dark. It was badly BURNED! I know it's burned because my cousin ordered the same and hers was really good, the onion is perfectly cooked and the sauce/cream is light and really aromatic."
T C.,"Sacramento, CA",0,96,13,4.0,12/6/2016,My wife and I stopped by on our way back from a 4hr road trip so the last thing we wanted to do is make dinner. We enjoy the food but sometimes you get that service that makes your food taste gross.  Cassandra came over after 10+ minutes of waiting with no bread or water. She apologized and then threw her co worker under the bus by saying I thought it was her table. Her tone was up beat at first. She continued to explain why she took so long that it was her day off but picked up this shift.  Then she finally asked us if we were ready to order we usually like to snack on some bread first but we just placed our order. The portions are pretty big so we like to share. My wife ordered appetizer wings as her entree and I got my usual chicken littles plate. She got coffee and I wanted water at the moment. I'm not sure if what we ordered made her upset or if she decided to not try giving us good service but after that her tone and attitude went down.  Too make my story short we noticed her being upbeat and cheerful with her other guest but with us it seemed she was over us. We weren't rude to her at all which in this case I would of been but my wife went over to the manager on duty and she came over and took care of the situation.  Diana was on it and was sorry we had a bad experience and ended up giving us a new waitress and a free cheesecake. I'm not sure if I got her name right but Rachel was friendly and made sure the rest of our meal and time there was pleasant.  The ironic thing about it was my wife noticed when we were waiting for our server to show up and greet us it was Rachel who told Cassandra that that couple (Us) is your table and has been waiting for you for awhile now and Cassandra rolled her eyes. How funny how things work out. I bet she regrets picking up that shift.
Genna B.,"West Sacramento, CA",64,1,,1.0,7/11/2017,Tuesday evenings are not a good time to go if you are looking for great customer service. Host was nice and sat us down quickly but the waiters and waitresses that served us were not very friendly. Food was good but felt like are servers were inconvenienced.
Kalynn C.,"Sacramento, CA",0,5,,1.0,12/16/2016,"Shout out to Lament G. for the worst service I've ever received ever. He was completely rude, inattentive and passive aggressive with my friend and I. I will not be back.  We were told we could sit in the bar area, so we did (or so we thought). We mistakenly chose a table next to the bar that was not actually included in the ""Open seating"" for the bar. When we were informed of this by our server, we apologized, tried to move to a different (and actually in the open seating area) table but Lament told us we were fine to stay. He proceeded to ignore us except to take our entire (drink/app) order and bring it to us. Normally I'll brush off bad service because I get it but this was obnoxious. If you're having a bad day or you're irritated, don't take it out on your customers.  The plus side? The factory nachos with spicy chicken were amazing."
Melissa P.,"Sacramento, CA",41,4,,2.0,5/31/2017,"My office called in an order yesterday for lunch (curbside pickup up). I arrived, called to let them know I was there and they promptly came out with my order.. Or so I thought... When I got back to work I found out that half the order was missing. My boss called and sure enough they said they had the rest of it.. And that they would have a manager make it right... So back in the car I go to get the rest of order... Again they quickly bring the food out... And tell me that they gave us 2 free cheesecakes.... Valued at$18.00... Kinda nice gesture except we still didn't get the original low carb cheesecake that we had ordered and no one in the office could eat the ones they gave us. The food was good but the service was horrible and it took me about an hour with both trips to pick up an order that was placed ahead of time...Disappointed for sure."
Kelly M.,"Paradise, CA",4,11,8,1.0,2/11/2016,"A sad experience at the Cheesecake Factory today! The buffalo kicker appetizer was cooked in oil that was too cold resulting in grease, grease and more grease. My server was pleasant when she brought me a new order, exactly the same as before-inedible.  My Kobe burger ordered medium-well was charred to oblivion, far past what I asked for. The meat was dry and burned on the bottom. The 'sauteed' mushrooms were dry and raw, also inedible. The sweet potato fries were cold and tasteless.  The upside? Good service and delicious iced tea. But $35 for mostly inedible food is a crying shame.  Stick with the Cheesecake, folks."
Elma B.,"Livermore, CA",2,31,9,5.0,4/30/2017,"We were out celebrating my husbands birthday with the family, and decided to go to Cheese cake factory since he's never been to this restaurant.  We walked into the restaurant to make reservations for 9, and the host asked us if we were willing to sit outside, it was a pretty warm night, and we agreed, but were told there would be about 45 minute to be seated.  We were given a pager after about a 40 minute wait the pager went off, checked in with the host and they had a table inside of the restaurant for us.  We were greeted  by our server and was given menus, he promptly asked us for our drink of choice, I ordered a Pineapple Mojito which was delicious, the ONLY thing that bothered me with the restaurant was the lighting, it was difficult to read the menu since the lights were so dim. I decided to pull my cell phone out to use the flashlight feature on my phone.  I choose the Thai Lettuce Chicken wraps, the food was delicious.  We were too full to order dessert, our waiter brought out a Sunday with a candle and they sang HB to him.  We had a wonderful experience, the food was amazing delicious, Thank you for a Great experience, KUDDOS to the entire staff, we will definitely come back to dine again."
