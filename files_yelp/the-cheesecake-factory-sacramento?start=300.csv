Sabrina Y.,"Sacramento, CA",0,8,,1.0,3/26/2017,"Hmm worst service yet! Told us the wait was 15 mins. Waited 24 mins. We then get buzzed for our table, but a lady walks in and says she needs a table of 5 and the hostess directs someone to seat her right away when her party isn't even here yet. So we stood there waiting for them to finish there conversation for an extra 3-4 mins. We were finally able to hand her our buzzard and were told to wait where we were. The hostess' talked among themselves for another few minutes so I ask the hostess are we going to be seated because we've been waiting an ongoing 7+ minutes? She says yes and then turns to other hostess to say some things about me. Clearly you looking at me and whispering shows your attitude towards me. We waited another 5 minutes before being seated. Mind you we've already been waiting 24 mins, get buzzed for a table and are still waiting an extra 10+ minutes to be seated. Don't buzz someone for a table and continue to seat other people that are buzzed after us and walk in after us. That's rude and since it's your policy of first come first serve for tables, why even seat other people before the ones who've been waiting the longest.   We also asked the hostess for a high chair as you can clearly see my child was not walking yet. The hostess was rude and had a very obnoxious attitude about grabbing the high chair.  Food came out quick and we were able to order quick. But 1 star for the lack of front of the house service. Definitely need better ladies with better attitudes and customer service to work the front."
Heidi D.,"Santa Rosa, CA",201,554,1076,2.0,5/23/2014,"(Wrong restaurant for the pics I posted! Sorry. Those are California Pizza Kitchen) It's a chain. Crazy packed on Saturday night and when we finally did get a seat, I'm pretty sure it was the most cramped spot in the restaurant.  Oh well, it was only the two of us.  We ordered ... Loaded Baked Potato tots - pretty good but a couple were sufficient, left a lot behind. Fire Roasted Chile Rellenos - too greasy and breaded to balance out the flavor. Even took off the breading but it wasn't tasty enough to repeat. Tex Mex Egg rolls - they were ok. Cheesecake #1 - Vanilla Bean - favorite bites of the night Cheesecake #2 - 30th Anniversary - it was ok. :) You pay for it being a chain. Not for the quality. Oh, very tasty Moscow Mule though. :)"
Terrelle K.,"Sacramento, CA",664,36,54,4.0,4/17/2016,"One of my favorite places to have a drink and some good food.  If your sitting in the car area ask for Tim , he serves in that area and is pretty cool.  He knows the menu very well and will give you a honest answer on the food."
Rainie A.,"Elk Grove, CA",47,10,10,3.0,9/11/2015,"A Thursday night, busy but no wait and plenty of tables open. Our server took forever to come over to take our orders and just as long to drop off our check. He was friendly, but you could tell he was starting to stress out. The bread basket was below average. I'm not fond of the wheat bread. It was a bit sweet and hard. I ordered the sweet tamale as an appetizer, very delicious, but I think it works better without the salsa, sour cream, and avocado since it was sweet. My entree was the chicken madeira. It was tender, topped with asparagus and mushrooms, and the sauce was good. The chicken itself had no flavor. The mashed potatoes were my favorite part. My friend ordered the chicken teriyaki. NEVER order Asian dishes from a non-Asian restaurant. It was almost 20 dollars for a plate of hard white rice and mediocre chicken. The maraschino cherry garnish was definitely interesting to see on the plate.... All in all, not a very good place to eat. Will come again to try something else if I ever feel like overpaying and sitting in a dark, cold room. PS I saw the Eye of Sauron.... Many of them. I wonder who else knows what I'm talking about xD"
MK C.,"Vacaville, CA",0,2,,5.0,6/15/2017,"Long wait for seating but it's worth waiting. Servers are fast and very polite. Vast selection of food and so far, I never had been dissappointed with it (taste and selection). This has become my favorite restaurant."
Keri W.,"Vallejo, CA",0,3,3,5.0,5/23/2017,"My family and I often visit this Cheesecake Factory we love the staff and the food is always amazing and fresh, well tonight we searched for something different because it was too late to cook and we were tired from work, so we ended up here & so glad we did we were blessed enough to have the Waitress Casandra D.(cass) she was beyond amazing she's very polite and well spoken very good at her job,she remembered our order by memory with appetizers included every request she granted she multitask really well so glad to have met her GREAT JOB CASANDRA and we will definitely be back to see you"
Keeley A.,"Sacramento, CA",24,154,9,4.0,5/6/2016,"What I don't get is why does anyone come in here for anything other than cheesecake? I don't care what time of day it is...I'm ordering cheesecake... because it is mind blowingly delicious. Just 4 stars because, seriously, it's too expensive. But, then, so is crack - and this is so much better. (I really don't know that ...because I don't use crack.)  This place is always packed, but we usually get our cheesecake to go, which doesn't take too long. Get this...I almost always order plain cheesecake. No cookie,candy,frosting, etc. People, people... it doesn't need all of that...maybe some strawberries - or chocolate crust variation.  On second thought, it's good that it is so expensive - or I might come every day. Thank you CCF."
Ai M.,"Sacramento, CA",3,33,21,1.0,2/27/2017,"So, I normally do curbside pick up as its handy when I'm pregnant and ready to pop but still need to satisfy my cravings. I also normally give a tip but lately this restaurant's service is going down hill.  I called in advance and they said it will take 20 minutes to get the food ready. I gave them 35 minutes as I don't like waiting. Called told them I've arrived-gave them my car make which store I'm facing and that I have cash so please just bring out the food. This restaurant doesn't have a card reader  like other restaurants and even if you give them cash, they take your cash then goes back in to get your food--a long drawn out process that could be more efficient. Regardless, seven minutes waiting and still no food. I called and asked them what's up? The lady didn't even apologize, and said the food will come out and hung up on me. Then a guy manager (I'm guessing as he is wearing a dress shirt and tie) comes out after 13 minutes (from when I first called) and said I need to secure payment first before I can bring out the food--even though I had exact cash. I've been coming here every week and normally this doesn't happen--again long drawn out process. Gave him the money, went back in to get my food, after five minutes, he came back out again with my food--mind you now I just want to leave and who knows if they've now spit on my food as I was already annoyed that they didn't come out with my food. The manager started taking out the food from the bag to show me each food, I was afraid the food might fall. I asked to just hand me the food and I can look while he is in front of me. I wanted to check as two weeks prior they messed up and gave me crab bites when I ordered and was charged for crab cakes (diff between $13 or so dollars to $7 or so dollars if memory serves me right and yes when I brought this up, they didn't offer a refund or an apology). Nevertheless, this is my last time going to this location.  Poor service, long and drawn out, not at all efficient, crab cakes is cold as hell, the salmon on my kale salad also cold. Normally, it should still be hot but not this time. 18 minutes to bring out food--ridiculous. And if any one was wondering, there were times that when they take this long, I just went in to get my food--well guess what, its even ridiculous as they ignore you and help out others that are trying to buy in the bakery section. They don't know the meaning of first come, first serve. I guess they figure that it takes awhile to walk to the kitchen to get my food where the people who wants cheesecakes can be helped asap because they clear them out first before trying to get my food. Wtf!!!"
Kenneth L.,"Saratoga, CA",213,388,414,4.0,2/24/2015,"My boyfriend and I went on a rainy Friday because we got the deal where you buy a Chessecake $25 giftcard and get 2 free cheesecakes. The wait was short and the food here is always good. The ordered the Chicken Bellagio and it filled me up fast. The dish has pesto angel hair pasta topped with a crispy chicken, arugula and prosciutto. The waiter was dumb and told us that the coupons for the free cheesecakes didn't work saying they have already been used. We were stumped cause it was our first time using it so we found her excuse to be stupid and asked for her to run the coupons again and it worked! She recommended me to get a cheesecake that I sorta did not like but whatever. I shall just stick to my originals, Fresh strawberry cheesecake. Can't go wrong with the originals. She recommended me the Raspberry cheesecake which was fine, but not the best.  I usually come here with the mindset that my meal will be roughly $20 after tip and tax. The chicken bellagio is $14 give or take. All in all, the food here is good and that's all the matters!"
Eric C.,"Carmichael, CA",396,183,1044,2.0,11/25/2015,"I really hate to give such a glorious looking place two stars, but in my experiences here -- this place just isn't ""all that!""  If you are just going for dessert, this place is an easy four stars!  Seriously, they do sweets up wonderfully and I have to give respect where respect is due.  That being said, let me tell the rest of the story like it is...      First of all, this place is beautiful inside and out.  When you walk inside you kind of expect to have an extra special experience.  It's always been clean during my experiences here and the staff is most often very friendly and prompt.  Those are the high marks.        The menu is way too big.  I think it is fantastic to have such a wide variety of food available to diners, but this menu takes way too long to browse through if you have no idea what you want to eat.  I am not sure if they have designed it that way for the customer to order appetizers while trying to decide on an entree, but if it is...  It's not cool.  Also, if you are dining in the evening, some of the dining rooms are extremely dark.  My eyesight isn't what it once used to be, so it is hard to read a bloated menu in the dark.      The food...  I can't remember everything I have eaten in the past, but I know nothing has blown my socks off enough to make me remember it.  Last night I tried the Louisiana Chicken Pasta (I would have taken a photo, but it was too dark in the dining room we were in).  When it got to the table it looked great, but there was no smell to it.  You should be able to smell good food when it is sitting in front of you.  The bowtie pasta was a little too molto al dente for me.  Not only that, there was very little flavor in the sauce.  The parmesan encrusted chicken was moist inside and crisp on the outside, but there was absolutely no seasoning in/on the chicken.  I ate about a fourth of the dish when I thought about drowning the rest in Sriracha.  By the time our waiter came by, I had already lost interest in the dish and had him take it away.  My girlfriend and her mother enjoyed their bacon-bacon burgers.  They also told me, after seeing I was not pleased, that I should try their nachos.  I have had their Mac-n-Cheese burger before and it is a decent burger, but it is nowhere near the goodness that should come with a $12 price tag; moreover, when I come to a place like this...  My first inclination is NOT to order a burger or nachos.  I can get a much better burger for half the price at The Habit (I'm not exaggerating either).  $17 for an overly-bland pasta dish is just unacceptable.  If you are going to run this place with a high end appearance, you should at least serve memorable food.        There is one thing I will remember about this place.  The reason why my girlfriend and her mom wanted to eat here last night was to pick up a Pumpkin Cheesecake for Thanksgiving.  When we saw that it was $52, we decided just to have dinner and skip the reason for showing up in the first place.  Ha!  I hate to hand out two star reviews, but from the handful of times I have been here, it is clear that The Cheesecake Factory NEEDS to step up it's game."
Narin K.,"North Natomas, Sacramento, CA",0,2,,1.0,2/23/2017,"This was the worst experience I have ever had. We arrived at approximately 8:15pm and were seated pretty promptly, there was maybe a 10 minute wait if that. Our server came over and took our order short after, everything seemed to being just fine. It all started going down hill when after 30-45 minutes, we were still sitting there with no food. At this point my 4 year old daughter is licking mayonnaise from an appetizer she devoured. During this wait the server did come around maybe twice to say ""it was just going to take a little longer"". Now after an hour, I was ready to get up and leave, my daughter was STARVING. I myself have been a waitress before and can most definitely understand when the restaurant is busy however from the looks of it, there was no possible way we should have waited over an hour for our food. I will not be returning."
Jody S.,"Sacramento, CA",9,1326,,4.0,12/11/2016,Chicken Romano with extra sauce and a white chocolate raspberry cheesecake slice is what I like. I'll definitely be back.
Vaneh Z.,"Glendale, CA",34,20,3,5.0,9/27/2016,"Very satisfied with our server. His name is Jay (Jayson) he was very very friendly. Very helpful. Happy. Had smile on his face all the time. Made us laugh on my husband's B-day day. Overall, very satisfied and happy :)"
Lydia S.,"Elk Grove, CA",34,53,34,5.0,3/8/2015,"The service here is phenomenal.  We've been coming here fairly frequently for about a month or two- sometimes 6 times in a few days even- but that's how amazing they are here.  Our all time favorite server is Brandon Z, But on days he isn't available our favorites have been Timothy, Geraldo, and Luis. Additionally, We've never had a meal that disappointed! At most- we found the potstickers to be salty,  And Rennes to not be our favorite.  We rant and rave over all pastas as those have been our go to menu items - each amazing as can be.  Recently we had the STEAK DIANE and oh my tastebuds just got rocked!! Asparagus as the side with Parmesan on top- wonderfully crisp to a perfection and steak medallions that explode your tastebuds!! Every single bite is heaven."
Jeanette T.,"Stockton, CA",16,153,891,1.0,12/23/2015,Food was fine nothing special. The service was TERRIBLE! Moses was our waiter and he came to our table only once after we were served to give us our bill. Did  NOT refill our drinks or check to see how our meal was. He was so consumed with the table in front of us that he couldn't be bothered to check on us or allow us to get his attention and after 20minutes into our meal I no longer needed anything. We did t even bother to order dessert as the service was so bad. Too bad the company doesn't read and respond as the last time I was here the food was far from good. Wont make this mistake again.
Hannah T.,"Arden Fair, CA",23,7,,1.0,2/3/2016,If I could give them zero stars I would -Binh  We were waiting for a long time and people got in before us. The bread was really stale and the staff was inattentive. They didn't have my friends dish available either. Food is more expensive than it's worth.
Daffodil L.,"San Francisco, CA",12,79,93,4.0,2/28/2016,"Love cheesecake factory for the food, consistency, & portions, though it *is* a little pricey.  Every time I've come, the farfalle with chicken and garlic is perfectly cooked and perfectly coated with a garlicky, cream sauce. The pasta always has a good bite to it, not being over or underdone. The sauce, though it could kill you calorie-wise, is super rich and very satisfying with bits of pancetta. For lunch, even though it isn't included in the lunch pastas, is $13.95 ($.50 more than than the other lunch pastas).  Highly recommend, especially the farfalle with chicken and garlic!"
Josh D.,"Elk Grove, CA",48,223,389,2.0,9/2/2016,"I have never been impressed by this restaurant. I think this is my second time eating dinner here and each time the food has been so disappointing. Had the steak and shrimp last night and it was about as bland and lacking flavor as food can possibly get. Our server was friendly, but the food took forever to come out and then when it was time for dessert it took forever just for the cheesecake to come out as if they were making it to order. The cheesecake is good which is their only saving grace for me because the food is not good at all. Maybe too many menu items (it was difficult to decide from such a large menu) making it difficult to do any one thing really well. I guess it was ok, but everything just took sooooo long and the food was not worth it and definitely not worth the price point."
Julie E.,"Stockton, CA",173,13,2,2.0,8/4/2016,"Honestly, I had high expectations when coming because of all the good things I heard. But this place is no more than an expensive Applebee's.  I Wasn't impressed at all. The cheesecake was probably the only thing that was good about my meal. My stuffed mushrooms were completely raw, and my steak was perfectly cooked on the inside, but burned on the outside, which means the heat they were cooking on was way too hot. Will only ever return for dessert."
Mary M.,"Cupertino, CA",0,15,,1.0,5/14/2017,"Long long menus and nice recipes. I would love to see a sense for more quality ingredients, using organic, grassfed, gluten-free, etc."

I myself have been a waitress before and can most definitely understand when the restaurant is busy however from the looks of it, there was no possible way we should have waited over an hour for our food. I will not be returning."

Lydia S.,"Elk Grove, United States",34,53,34,5.0,8/3/2015,"The service here is phenomenal.  We've been coming here fairly frequently for about a month or two- sometimes 6 times in a few days even- but that's how amazing they are here.  Our all time favorite server is Brandon Z, But on days he isn't available our favorites have been Timothy, Geraldo, and Luis. Additionally, We've never had a meal that disappointed! At most- we found the potstickers to be salty,  And Rennes to not be our favorite.  We rant and rave over all pastas as those have been our go to menu items - each amazing as can be.  Recently we had the STEAK DIANE and oh my tastebuds just got rocked!! Asparagus as the side with Parmesan on top- wonderfully crisp to a perfection and steak medallions that explode your tastebuds!! Every single bite is heaven."
Jeanette T.,"Stockton, United States",16,153,891,1.0,23/12/2015,Food was fine nothing special. The service was TERRIBLE! Moses was our waiter and he came to our table only once after we were served to give us our bill. Did  NOT refill our drinks or check to see how our meal was. He was so consumed with the table in front of us that he couldn't be bothered to check on us or allow us to get his attention and after 20minutes into our meal I no longer needed anything. We did t even bother to order dessert as the service was so bad. Too bad the company doesn't read and respond as the last time I was here the food was far from good. Wont make this mistake again.
Hannah T.,"Arden Fair, United States",23,7,,1.0,3/2/2016,If I could give them zero stars I would -Binh  We were waiting for a long time and people got in before us. The bread was really stale and the staff was inattentive. They didn't have my friends dish available either. Food is more expensive than it's worth.
Daffodil L.,"San Francisco, United States",12,79,93,4.0,28/2/2016,"Love cheesecake factory for the food, consistency, & portions, though it *is* a little pricey.  Every time I've come, the farfalle with chicken and garlic is perfectly cooked and perfectly coated with a garlicky, cream sauce. The pasta always has a good bite to it, not being over or underdone. The sauce, though it could kill you calorie-wise, is super rich and very satisfying with bits of pancetta. For lunch, even though it isn't included in the lunch pastas, is $13.95 ($.50 more than than the other lunch pastas).  Highly recommend, especially the farfalle with chicken and garlic!"
Josh D.,"Elk Grove, United States",48,223,389,2.0,2/9/2016,"I have never been impressed by this restaurant. I think this is my second time eating dinner here and each time the food has been so disappointing. Had the steak and shrimp last night and it was about as bland and lacking flavor as food can possibly get. Our server was friendly, but the food took forever to come out and then when it was time for dessert it took forever just for the cheesecake to come out as if they were making it to order. The cheesecake is good which is their only saving grace for me because the food is not good at all. Maybe too many menu items (it was difficult to decide from such a large menu) making it difficult to do any one thing really well. I guess it was ok, but everything just took sooooo long and the food was not worth it and definitely not worth the price point."
Julie E.,"Stockton, United States",173,13,2,2.0,4/8/2016,"Honestly, I had high expectations when coming because of all the good things I heard. But this place is no more than an expensive Applebee's.  I Wasn't impressed at all. The cheesecake was probably the only thing that was good about my meal. My stuffed mushrooms were completely raw, and my steak was perfectly cooked on the inside, but burned on the outside, which means the heat they were cooking on was way too hot. Will only ever return for dessert."
Mary M.,"Cupertino, United States",0,15,,1.0,14/5/2017,"Long long menus and nice recipes. I would love to see a sense for more quality ingredients, using organic, grassfed, gluten-free, etc."
