Bob E.,"Linden, CA",6,18,,2.0,6/24/2016,"The food and service is great. This Cheesecake Factory has a severe temperature control problem. They have the temperature so low that it makes a lousy dining experience.  I have heard several people complain about it and even seen lady's wrapping their legs with a napkin. I have complained in the past, but just seems to go over their head. I'm no longer going to spend big bucks and my dining experience freezing to death. You need to prove your temperature control or you're going to loose several customers."
Harley H.,"Twentynine Palms, CA",0,21,8,1.0,7/27/2016,"unfortunately I won't be able to give this location a better review. I gave it another shot and went to the cheesecake factory for my husbands birthday. We ordered one slice to share because we were pretty full from our dinner at Bandera. The service this time was horrible. Our server acted like she was extremely busy even though it was later in the evening and not crowded at all (around 945/10pm November 2nd) She wouldn't even fully stop at our table to ask if we wanted anything else, she would just pass by like ""you guys good?"" She didn't smile or make us feel comfortable to be there. I was so upset because I gave it a second shot when I really didn't want to. My husband thought maybe she didn't care about us much cause we just ordered a slice and maybe she assumed we wouldn't tip or something. Well we did tip. We are decent people and deserve decent and profession service whether we are ordering one thing or many things. please encourage your staff to be friendly and professional. The one star is for the delicious cheesecake."
S J.,"Winters, CA",0,6,,5.0,10/20/2016,"I've only eaten at Cheesecake a handful of times over the years but I've always had a great experience. Today was no different. My friend and I were starving and borderline hangry when we first arrived. We started with one server but ended up having another stop by and take care of us throughout our visit. It turned out she was training the other server so we were spoiled by a little extra attention between the two of them.  Cheesecake has an insanely large menu so it took us a few minutes to decide. We started with the Tuna Tartare and Beet & Goat Cheese - both of which were excellent!  I tried their veggie burger and she had the smokehouse burger. If you have ever had the veggie burger at Rutherford Grill, theirs is very similar. It's delicious! I can't say how my friends burger tasted but she practically licked her plate.  All in all, we had a very good lunch. I'm so impressed by how well they are able to execute such a large menu. They are timely in delivery, everything tastes fresh and flavorful and is also presented well.  My expectations are low for chain restaurants so it is so nice to have had such a positive experience. Well done Cheesecake Factory... well done. Everything was on point. Thank you to our lovely server(s) and good luck to the trainee! We will be back!"
Yvonne T.,"Kailua-Kona, HI",0,19,4,5.0,10/3/2016,"TCF is my favorite restaurant ever so my review is a bit biased. However the Sacramento location is always has the friendliest and most efficient staff.  We had a problem with the location we were seated at after waters had been served (due to my husband's hearing issues) and the hostess was most understanding and helpful to get us a different table. Food, as always, was delicious and the best strawberry shortcake topped off our yummy meal."
Letter W.,"Citrus Heights, CA",0,216,,3.0,10/2/2016,I was seated quickly. The service was good. The food was good but not great. It certainly doesn't warrant the prices that are charged. My dessert was entirely too sweet.
Sarah K.,"Roseville, CA",0,2,,3.0,1/31/2017,"This wasn't my first visit to the Cheesecake Factory but it was definitely the worst experience I have had there. I met a friend for brunch and ordered the Green Chilaquiles with Carnitas and Eggs, and I asked for the eggs to be poached medium. When the meal came, there were no eggs. The meal was delivered by a runner, not the server. By the time the server came by to check on us, I had started eating the carnitas and chips, which were delicious. He finally came by and I pointed out that there were no eggs, and he said he'd get them for me right away. It again took quite awhile for the eggs to come and when they did, again delivered by a different runner, they were poached to the point of being hard boiled. I put them off to the side and did not eat them and while the server walked by a few times and glanced at our plates, he did not seem to notice that the eggs were cooked incorrectly or pause to check on us. When we got the bill I had been charged for an extra side of eggs. The server took the charge off the bill, but it was something that should never have been on the bill to begin with as eggs are supposed to be part of the dish. We also never got a refill on our drinks.  I would go back to Cheesecake Factory, but probably not to this location."
Coleen M.,"Sacramento, CA",69,61,5,4.0,9/28/2016,"Had lunch at The Cheesecake Factory, the food was good, service was good, but a little too pricey. The wait was a little longer than expected. Overall a good experience."
Coley K.,"Zephyr Cove, NV",30,45,32,4.0,3/28/2016,"The promt  service, jumbo iced tea glasses, and the fact that my Vegetable Salad was fresh, made up for the fact that I didn't order food like all the  (normal, meat-eating) people around me.  Ugh. Next time..."
Jasmine T.,"Alhambra, CA",82,17,48,4.0,4/5/2015,"I absolutely love it here. It was my first time eating here and it did not disappoint. I came around 12ish (and on the day of Easter), so it was pretty crowded. The wait was about 30-40mins. But the good thing is that it's right next to the mall so you can spend your time walking around instead of just sitting there. & they text you when it's time to be seated :)  Okay, enough with that. Let's talk about the food !! ~^___^~ FOOD~~~ 1) Firecracker Salmon --pretty pricey for the amount that you get. ($10.95 for 4 pieces) But delicious. Basically salmon wrapped with egg roll sheets and fried. The salmon inside each did not have a fishy aftertaste, and the sweet sauce at the bottom of the plate completes the overall taste. I don't know if they added the red cabbages just to make it look nice, but I do recommend eating it with the rolls. The cabbage gives that extra crunch that's needed. Plus, the sauce is all over it so it tastes great! 2) Farfalle w/ Chicken and Roasted Garlic --DELICIOUS. It had a smokey taste to it from the bacon bits and the caramelized onions. And the taste of the roasted garlic overwhelms the dish in a good way. The chicken that it comes with was very soft and not chewy at all.  I personally love garlic and onions so this entrée was purrrfect for me. AND who can so no to bacon? 3) Louisiana Chicken Pasta --ALSO DELCIOUS! This dish had a more tangy taste to it with a kick of spice. It tasted like I was in New Orleans! The red and yellow peppers complimented the spices that completed the dish.  Overall, it was a great experience. I'm sad I got so full from the appetizers and pastas because I didn't get to try any of the cheesecakes! & the place is called CHEESECAKE Factory -__-"" but oh wells. That just gives me an excuse to come back ^__~"
Justin S.,"Davis, CA",125,9,8,4.0,3/25/2016,"I've been here many many times, the food is always consistently good.  There are some superstars and let downs on their menu.  Chicken Costelleta and Madera are some of their most popular dishes.  Service takes a fall when they are busy.  If you don't want to wait an hour to be seated and wait 40 min for your food come for either a late lunch or dinner.  The food quality doesn't worsen the later is gets which is nice."
Karli D.,"Elk Grove, CA",91,340,768,4.0,11/2/2014,"I enjoy dining at the Cheesecake Factory simply because I love food options and cheesecake is absolutely delicious! I have frequented this restaurant on a variety of occasions over the last couple of years and have yet to be disappointed. The menu is a tad bit pricey but the portions are adequate and the service is always fast and friendly. The other day I stopped by to try lunch on their ""skinny licious"" menu and decided to order the chicken and mushroom lettuce wraps. Not only was it delicious, but it was a bargain at less than $6. Also their to-go cheesecake is a great idea if you prefer to take your dessert on the go. Will be returning here for future meals!"
Carlo V.,"Sacramento, CA",0,26,10,4.0,3/6/2016,A great place to eat at for all occasions! The service is great and the food is fresh! Sometimes there's a wait if u go on a Friday night but the service and food will be well worth it! The desert is amazing because they have a wide selection! This location is convenient because there's so many other place to go around it!!
Kami J.,"Placerville, CA",20,21,7,5.0,10/3/2016,The avocado egg rolls are my favorite appetizer here. I've never had a bad experience and the service is always great. This place can get very busy though so plan ahead or expect to wait for a table.
Kate H.,"Folsom, CA",4,7,,3.0,7/4/2016,"The service was wonderful but the chicken Marcela lacked any flavor and the bow tie pasta was under cooked to say the least. I don't usually return a meal, but the thought was there. I should of known better than to order Italian food in a cheesecake factory. Cake and ice cream for my next order here if I ever return with friends or family. We need some comment cards for future thoughts."
Jess T.,"Sacramento, CA",0,6,,4.0,6/30/2016,"The last 3 times I've been here my fries were served cold. Not the end of the world, but fresh hot fries are a lot more enjoyable. Still a nice atmosphere. Also, I thought they used to give cheesecake when it was your birthday? My mom got basically a scoop of whipped cream."
Johnny S.,"Sacramento, CA",17,68,35,2.0,1/1/2016,Food was bland. Thats really all I got. I pretty much eat before I meet my friends there.  They should spice it up.. *get it* Lines were out the door when they first opened.. Now you can get a seat with no issues. Hope yours was better than mines
Ranaldo S.,"Sacramento, CA",330,85,322,3.0,10/16/2015,"Cheesecake has always been ok to me. I don't really eat at chain restaurants anymore tho. Cheesecake does have some bomb buffalo blast tho & the diff cheesecakes are bomb as well. They should be tho huh. I would hate to eat a terrible cheesecake from the Cheesecake Factory, lol."
Crystal K.,"Los Angeles, CA",20,133,69,4.0,2/5/2017,The wait was ridiculous but Zachary gave us stellar service. He was on point and kept coming back with bread! His service was really impeccable and made our night. Thanks Zachary.
Amy T.,"Union City, CA",1681,294,2243,4.0,3/12/2013,"""You've never been to Cheesecake Factory?!"" Is what all my friends ask me when I tell them that I've never been to this place before. Well now I can brag to them that I finally did!  I decided to come to this place for my first time for my 22nd birthday dinner on a Friday night. 4 of my friends and I came here around 6:30pm (sad we missed the Happy Hour 4-6pm) and it was packed, but luckily we were able to get a booth in like 10-15 minutes.  I asked my friends what was good here and I read the reviews of this place and everyone talks about their cheesecake; specifically their Red Velvet cheesecake so I knew I had to get that for dessert.  Started off with the unlimited bread! I love love their brown bread (had a sweet taste to it) I ended up ordering the Avocado Eggrolls for appetizers and shared it with my friends; we all loved it! For my entree I got the Factory Combination (Steak and Salmon) and it was served with mashed potatoes and asparagus. I really enjoyed the steak (marinated in a sauce with mushrooms too) and the mashed potatoes (I'm a big fan of mashed potatoes) and the salmon and asparagus was alright. Steak was the right texture, not too tough and the mashed potatoes were creamy. My friend recommended me to get the Factory Peach Bellini (not a strong drink but a very fruity/girly drink) and I enjoyed it! And of course for dessert, I had a Red Velvet Cheesecake and the staff sang me Happy Birthday as well. Everyone was right, their Red Velvet Cheesecake is the bomb! A few of my friends also bought the Dulce de leche Cheesecake for TOGO and all I can say is that it was also very delicious as well."
Carla M.,"Sacramento, CA",0,12,,5.0,3/13/2017,"It always hits the spot! Favorite chain restaurant.. gotta love anywhere that you can have appetizer, drinks, a meal and dessert. No way will you be able to get that all in. Portion sizes are beyond plentiful. So many options! I love my gal pals and I meet like once a quarter and choose different things to share and still able to take home left-overs! Right now my favorite dish is the Cajun Jambalaya pasta with chicken and shrimp.. spicy and good! And in complete love with the salted caramel cheesecake.. have to work on the restraint to not overindulge- I'm losing! :)"
