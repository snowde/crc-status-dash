Julie B.,"West Sacramento, CA",0,9,4,2.0,10/1/2016,"This place is consistently OUT of something!  Every time we visit, we get the same song and dance about being out of whatever we order.  This time, it happens to be the artichokes.  Order enough food to satisfy your customers!"
Phillip M.,"Stockton, CA",0,4,,5.0,9/11/2016,I went here on 9/10 with my girlfriend for date night. We ordered our food and it seemed to be taking a while but we didn't care we were talking and joking around. After 40 mins the manager popped up and told us she is so sorry about the wait and the salmon got messed up. She offered to comp our food and give us a piece of Cheesecake. This was completely unnecessary because we eat their regularly and we don't go out looking for free meals. But this manager showed amazing customer service and made Both of us want to come back. She was very nice and apologetic and we will come back more now than ever. You guys had a great manager on Saturday but I can't remember her name. She seems vital to The success at this location ! We will see you soon and thank you!
Marco V.,"Manteca, CA",0,5,7,2.0,6/14/2016,I dont think i will be going hear for dinner any time soon. i felt like they treat you like a nobody when you come and eat hear. the waiting time to seat it you down takes for ever & when they serve you they dont go in order they first brought there food to a couple that got seated after us and order there food after we had order that really bothered me. the only reason why they deserve a 2 star rating from me is because there food was okay.
Cacouly P.,"Sacramento, CA",15,11,,3.0,3/28/2016,"I love the cheesecakes, I think I tasted them all! But once we try other things and I get sick, too much oil, everything seems to be frozen... I don't like it when you have a menu with more than 2 pages, it's a sign that the food is not fresh at all and has to be frozen.  For pastas, pizzas, burgers... there's so many better places."
Jen W.,"San Francisco, CA",695,1379,2318,3.0,7/14/2013,"I've been to my fair share of Cheesecake Factory locations and never really liked the food.   So, I've figured it out.  Cheesecake...to-go.  Yes!  I've noticed that anything with chocolate is über sweet or that just may be my preference.  I'm definitely a simple cheesecake type of gal...plain, strawberry, vanilla bean, banana cream...you get the gist.   Walk in, order your cheesecake to go at the register, ask for a fork, and get the heck out of the craziness!"
Eve K.,"Sacramento, CA",40,89,50,2.0,4/14/2016,"Disappointed would be an understatement. Now I know why I haven't had The Cheesecake Factory before. Who has two thumbs and loves Cheesecake? This guy!  And this didn't cut it as Cheesecake....  It wasn't horrible, but 2 pieces of cheesecake with tip ran $20, and I can think of many places with MUCH better cheesecake than that...  So now we head home, pouty faces on, disappointed with our dessert calories wasted tonight. Oh well, had to try it sooner or later I guess, at least we had a gift card....  Wish we had used it on cocktails ;)."
Jenn S.,"North Highlands, CA",0,15,18,5.0,1/23/2016,"Went here for lunch and the place was packed. Took awhile to get food however it was worth the wait. Had the superfood kale salad with roasted pears, red grapes, avocados, kale, blueberry lemon vinaigrette, sunflower seeds, and marinated broccoli that was still crunchy and full of flavor. Option to add meat for additional cost however it is not needed"
Corina V.,"Antelope, CA",57,14,4,2.0,8/15/2016,The service was great! Our waitress was very nice and quick with our drinks and food. The food was ok. The price is a little much for something as simple as a lettuce wrap. Drinks are really expensive and pretty weak. I probably won't come back. Not really my cup of tea.
Petra N.,"Mather, CA",0,24,5,5.0,1/17/2016,"Hubby took me out for my birthday dinner and let me tell you...it was awesome! The service was great and food was delicious! Our server was Arynne. She is very knowledgable about her menu and gave me a great suggestion pertaining to my Greek Salad. The wait for our order was within reason considering how busy the place is (always) My husband enjoyed his Ribeye Steak which was cooked to perfection and I had  Steak Tacos. When my plate arrived it seemed like I would need a take- home container. My taste buds said ""nope"" and so all yummy Tacos disappeared.  I did take home some cheesecake for tomorrow ;-) P.S. Be sure to ask for Arynne :-)"
Xtyn C.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,7,,1.0,3/12/2017,"Food is always great at Cheesecake Factory but their staff is just horrible at this location! The hostess are snotty and has plenty of attitude. Ladies, smile! Greet your customers as if it's a pleasure having them at your restaurant! The waitress was not very helpful too. Maybe the staff is underpaid? Kaylie, the manager though is professional and attentive."
Monica T.,"Seattle, WA",161,189,36,4.0,11/21/2015,Pretty typically Cheesecake Factory.  Great menu and a huge selection of different food to choose from. All the food there is always amazing.  Always meets expections.   Watch out if you go there on a Friday or Saturday night during dinner hour.  These always seems like its the most busy.  But well worth the wait.
Derek L.,"Sacramento, CA",528,66,5,5.0,5/3/2016,"I took my little sister to dinner for her 21st birthday last night. The server Emily was awesome. And the food was also great! Fantastic serving sizes, quality, and service. Nothing more to ask for! :)"
Kurt C.,"Sacramento, CA",694,407,2176,4.0,6/21/2014,"I've been lucky enough to have outstanding service here the many different occasions I've gone. Most of the previous visits involved birthdays and I don't remember having ever been neglected the slightest by any of the workers here.  Their servers are conversant, but without being too imposing. The restaurant is huge and they are quite efficient with their use of space from the entrance to the bar, from the dining area to the patio seating -- everything is carefully organized and seemingly spotless. It ultimately makes for a clean and comforting environment.  The food has consistently been satisfactory. I've tried their Fried Calamari appetizer. It's light, and excellent with the garlic dip and the cocktail sauce. The most recent visit I had their Loaded Tater Tots, which you have to be careful with because it comes out really hot; you don't want to burn your tongue and ruin your whole dining experience. Give it a couple minutes and then you can selfishly munch on these tiny flavorful tots. Fresh Grilled Salmon was what I got for my main entree. I was feeling seafood, so why not? It was cooked perfectly, and went well with the mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli.  Now for the REAL main entree ;) -- the S'mores Cheesecake! It looked as good as I imagined it in my head, and that rarely happens. It tasted even better, so I was extremely pleased, to say the least. Melted marshmallow, crunchy graham crackers, chocolate cheesecake...I can't go on..my mouth's watering too much..Cheesecake Factory sure lives up to their name ~"
Angelica ..,"Sacramento, CA",0,5,,3.0,3/7/2017,"Service was good. No complaints on our server. Only complaint is the new menu. Please bring back the chicken di panna dish. I came out from a different city just for this dish. Disappointed it was removed from menu. Didn't eat what I wanted. Will be awhile before I return. Maybe only for cheesecake. Also, have fresher bread. The sourdough is really hard and stale to eat."
Pu B.,"Elk Grove, CA",123,491,2117,5.0,10/5/2014,Their ahi poke is excellent and I asked my girlfriend out here so it's one of my favorite spots
Richard L.,"Sparks, NV",2,6,,1.0,10/2/2015,Could this Location have been any worse?  The food was terrible as the holiday sauce was broken and dry.  The eggs runny and cold.  Plus add the terrible service that took 15 minutes to get our drinks; all of the food came out in pieces with several peoples plates and meals coming in pieces.   I don't even think they cared.  The manager only comped one meal and didn't even know how holiday sauce was suppose to look or how to cook it.   PATHETIC!  Someone please fix this.  For such an expensive building this place should have people that know what they are doing at least.  Doesn't even deserve a star
Samantha C.,"Sacramento, CA",109,200,35,3.0,8/17/2015,"The line on a Saturday is CRAAAAAZY. The best way to describe the waiting area is: CROWD. There is nowhere to sit and unsure where to stand. Best to come here on a week night. Luckily, the day I came, I just wanted to pickup a 6-inch original cheesecake for $13. Everything else seemed overpriced. The cheesecake I got was bomb, though, so no problem there."
Maybeline C.,"Sacramento, CA",37,140,88,4.0,8/24/2015,Good food and good service. I usually come during lunch so it isn't as packed as the dinner crowd. There miso salmon is amazing and so is there fried mac and cheese balls which are amazing. There chicken Alfredo is also really good. But most of all their cheesecakes are always on point especially the ultimate red velvet cheesecake! But I mean all their cheesecakes are good! I just like coming here when I'm craving cheesecakes because they never fail to satisfy!
Miss C.,"Castro Valley, CA",0,48,6,5.0,6/26/2016,came late and service was still great.... we were deep in girl chat and didn't realize it was nearly 1am. They were polite and didn't rush us. Lol... the ginger cocktail (can't think of the name) made us lose track of time. Lol... I always come to this location when I'm in the area.
Danielle S.,"Charleston, SC",8,18,2,4.0,12/24/2015,"I've always loved the Cheesecake Factory, no matter the location. They have everything you can think of & it's always amazing!  The only complaint I have is, take out. I've ordered take out twice & it never taste as good as dining in. I will never order take out from here again.  My favorites are the Chicken Bellagio and the Chipotle pastaand of course the honey wheat brown bread."
