Kimberly R.,"San Pedro, CA",10,12,4,1.0,7/28/2016,My husband and I were told that we had to wait 10-15 minutes and see if we could be seated outside because no server wanted to take anymore tables outside. finally they said no.
Chaulzy S.,"Sacramento, CA",50,78,75,2.0,8/24/2015,This update is for the curbside service. I was craving cheesecake and ordered 3 cheesecake slices.. ( not all for myself) they asked if it was curbside I said yes and let them know which car and the name.  My bf shows up to pick up and he calls them 3x. Finally on 3rd try they answer and tell him someone will be right out. ....... After 10mins no one showed. So he calls me complaining. He goes in ( not expecting to) and everyone seemed to have acting as if they didn't know he was outside waiting.  What hours have taking him 20mins to get there pick up and come home ended up taking him almost an hr. If you are going to have curbside at least try and succeed if you are working that station.
Amber G.,"Redding, CA",1,76,57,1.0,8/7/2016,So disappointed as we love this chain. We were seated fast. Order placed. Our Kobe burgers were rare...we asked for medium. The waiter gladly took back and said they'd fix it....unfortunately he must have sent in a new order so it took 30 more minutes. By this time our kids were done and ready to go. When our new Kobe burgers arrived they were well done. It's not often that we spend this amount on dinner and when we do I expect the food to be prepared correctly.
Margaret L.,"San Ramon, CA",374,566,247,3.0,6/15/2014,"I love cheesecake factory. I remember this was my favorite restaurant when I was in high school, I haven't been back for many years! So I decided to come back with my family for dinner. Cheesecake factory is always busy, so we came here on a weekend so it would be a short wait! Although we came early, it was still busy. We didn't have to wait very long though. I love that this place has such a variety of foods. The salads are delicious. The burgers are ginormous. The pasta is yummy. The bread is warm and chewy. Everything here is yum, you can always find something here for the whole family!  The reason I am giving this place 3 stars is for the service. I felt like our waiter was unattentive. Although nice, he seemed rush. He gave us our check when he gave us our dessert. When does cheesecake factory do this? He asked us for boxes when we weren't even finish with our foods. What the heck? I just didn't like the service. Usually, I find the service here relatively decent but that one time just made me angry. I definitely will come back, I love cheesecake and the foods here, but be aware - service might not be top notch or pleasing. If you do come here, don't forget to get the cheesecake - yum! Also, their servings are large. I ordered a salad - enough for two meals! Definitely a steal!"
andy h.,"Davis, CA",16,3,,5.0,1/28/2017,"Amazing service, good food, and a nice environment! Music is loud, but can easily be drowned out by chatting! Perfect for families, and amazing. Tem out of Tem."
Judy T.,"Sacramento, CA",16,53,54,5.0,12/18/2015,"When my boyfriend and I do not know where to go to dinner, the Cheesecake Factory never fails us. We have eaten here so many times. I usually get pasta, my favorite is the bistro shrimp pasta. I love their original red velvet cheesecake. They provide great customer service and their food is delicious as well! Love coming here!"
John A.,"Brisbane, Australia",43,243,743,4.0,6/19/2013,"First off you should check the menu out online before you get here as it as the size of a small novel, so it would save you a lot of time. After plenty of reading I decided on the salmon with asparagus and mash. The salmon was seasoned well whilst slightly overcooked, with the side of mash also being seasoned well giving a nice addition to the plate. Like the menu the serving sizes are very generous and will keep most people very happy. The service we received was fantastic with a few extra touches giving a real lift to the dinner experience.  In summary you will get good value for your dollar with fairly well executed food. Food 6.5/10 service 8.5/10 decor 7/10"
Sunshine H.,"Canyon Lake, CA",1,6,18,5.0,7/14/2016,Just had awesome service and really good food. We decided to sit outside because we were hungry and it was really pleasant.
Staja J.,"Sacramento, CA",172,90,144,3.0,7/28/2014,"For some reason this restaurant has never knocked my socks off but you know you can get decent food here. Honestly, I am not a fan of restaurants that have a tone of menu items. Long story short, I never suggest this place for dinner but when I do have to take one for the team and come here I know I will be able to find something to eat. DECOR: Always very nice. Perfect for a casual or semi-fancy dinner.  FOOD: I mean it is alright. Super basic food in my opinion but how fancy can you get if you have 500 items on the menu? LOL. The food is decent, I always leave full. I actually really love the crab cakes here. Really decent for the price. I am glad I discovered them on my recent visit so now I can have something to look forward to when I get dragged here. BUT. The cheese cake is terrible. It tastes super processed which honestly broke my heart because I love cheesecake. You would think a place called ""Cheesecake Factory"" would be able to get at least the cheesecake right...sad sad sad.  SERVICE: The staff is always pretty good. You can tell they are well trained. One thing I love about CCF is that the staff wears all white. It makes me feel like they do their best to stay clean and be clean. Wearing all white just gives off a good impression. Also, I love that this place is open late.  Overall, I do not mind taking one for the team when I have to come here but I am always expecting average food...nothing spectacular."
Linde H.,"Alameda, CA",352,180,138,4.0,9/20/2014,"I really really like this place.  Well, just cheesecake factories in general. Whenever I come here, I usually get too full off the bread and butter before I can even get to my meal. I do have a usual though, I drink the island ice tea with 2 packets of the sugar in the raw, then for pasta, I usually get the pasta da vinci or the louisiana chicken pasta. The pasta da vinci is so sweet, it has penne pasta and a creamy whine sauce with mushrooms and thinking about it right now makes my mouth water. The louisiana is creamy but has a little kick of spice in it topped chicken that's crispy till you get full and leave it in the fridge for the next day.  Leftovers aren't bad though folks. AND WHEN I'M FEELIN REAL FANCY, I get the key lime cheesecake after. Not too sweet or fatty but that doesn't stop me from eating the whipped cream."
Mishelei B.,"Sacramento, CA",1,16,5,5.0,12/9/2015,"The best place for happy hour with my girls, and great for dinner with my man :) Even though they took my favorite dish off the menu (chicken fettuccine with sun dried tomatoes) I still have other dishes to choose from too. (Salmon asparagus and mash Or Steak Diane with shrimp and mash, avocado rolls etc)"
Thanh B.,"Sacramento, CA",1511,188,1002,5.0,8/14/2012,"My date took me here recently, and it was also my first visit ever to The Cheesecake Factory! I was very impressed with the set up of this place. Dim lighting and classy decors. I also love the fact that they're opened late! They have quite a good menu selection. I ordered my favorite thing in the world: Fettucine Alfredo with Chicken.  Uh, yummmmmmmmmmmmmmm!  My eyes totally lit up when the food arrived. Yes, this place is a teensy-bit pricy. My dish was around $16+ and so are most others I've seen. But they give very generous food portions! It was so delicious (a bit oily though). I ended up forgetting to save room for one of their famous slice of cheesecake. Oh well, worth it.  I will definitely be back so I'm not too worried about missing out on dessert.  Friendly service, beautiful place, delicious food.  *Oh, and free bread and butter at the beginning of every meal."
Sadhna N.,"Sacramento, CA",0,2,,5.0,8/4/2016,This is one of the best restaurants for getting all types of food. The options are so many that every time I go here I sit and look at the menu for a while. My favorite is their jambalaya and the brunch options. I really reccomend this place.
Andrea R.,"Sacramento, CA",173,74,329,3.0,5/27/2015,"Cheesecake Factory is either a hit or miss with me. The appetizers are always delicious but my entrees either end up bring great, or I'm left dissatisfied and un impressed.  I went this past Friday and I must say that I left dissatisfied. Server took forever to bring the bread, and when she did it was extremely hard! When my friend told her the bread was pretty hard her response was ""That's how it's supposed to be."" We were both in shock and disgusted at her attitude. We both ordered pasta dishes, he got the Cajun Chicken Pasta which was good, and I had the Chicken Pasta with Scampi Sauce. I've had this dish before and it was full of flavor, however, this time the sauce was flavorless and my pasta was a bit dry. I asked for some extra sauce and the server again gave me an attitude. I work in customer service so when I ask for something or bring something to someones attention I'm always pleasant and professional. This gal just had an attitude.  I will say .... for an appetizer .... I highly recommend the Firecracker Salmon! It's always delicious, flavorful, and not too heavy, so it leaves room for all the food they give you as an entree. Because of the poor service this time....we didn't even want to stay for dessert. I'll be back though because I wouldn't let just one bad server ruin my experience as a whole."
Ariel T.,"Rodeo, CA",13,22,18,4.0,11/14/2015,Fish and chips were excellent! Fries were delish! Not floppy:) they were soo crispy and the batter to the fish was soooo crunchy omg! It was very yummy. Love this place.
Helen H.,"Sacramento, CA",386,1335,3155,4.0,2/9/2013,"We started with Thai lettuce wraps as appetizers. They were ok, but I didn't like the coconut curry noodles. For my entrée I ordered the barbeque ranch chicken salad (avocado, tomato, grilled corn, black beans, cucumber and romaine with barbeque ranch dressing and topped with crispy fried onion strings). It was a big salad, maybe I should've gotten an appetizer salad instead. Salad cravings satisfied! It's so dark in here! You need a flashlight to look at the menu. J/k. Our waitress was quick and friendly. I raised an eyebrow at the cake cutting fee though (We were celebrating a birthday and had our own cake.). It was $1 per slice."
Jonathan P.,"Carmichael, CA",379,30,33,4.0,6/24/2016,"Time for dessert! Yum! The food is usually great too. One time not so much, but usually."
K. Onda Guera ?.,"Vallejo, CA",27,99,59,3.0,9/28/2015,"Disappointed.  The service was less than wonderful, the food meh.  I was with a party of 8 and as our food was being served they dimmed the lights to the point we could hardly see our food.  The people at the table next to us complained to the waitress, I agreed and requested they turn the lights up at least a little.  We were told ""that's just our nightly routine"".   Our waitress never even said she would speak to a manager or anything.  Shortly there after a group sat at a table behind ours and used the lights on their cell phones to read the menu...I snapped a pic.  Horrible customer service.  I can understand turning down the lights in the bar area, but not in the dining area.  Very disappointed."
Brian M.,"Sacramento, CA",95,125,51,1.0,4/22/2015,"Overpriced, mediocre food, crowded chain restaurant. Came here for a family event, waited for an hour to be seated. You get to your table and the menu im not kidding, is 11 pages long. They must have at least 150 dinner dishes to pick from. The free bread was the most flavorful and fullfilling thing here even though its fairly small you find yourself just waiting for them to bring you more free bread.  Wife had meatloaf and I had a burger.  Both were about as untriumphant and a letdown, as a cat taking a piss on your blanket. Oh wait the dessert cant be bad right? Wrong! Ive had better cheesecake from Trader joes frozen aisle. They couldnt wait to collect their money then herd more people in. Do yourself a favor and stay home or watch a tom selleck movie on acid"
Jessi L.,"El Dorado, CA",4,59,15,5.0,6/21/2015,"I've been to the Cheesecake Factory too many times to count and never had a bad experience. The food has always been on point and service good. Yesterday my boyfriend and I went for lunch & decided to sit at the bar, Luis was our server. I'm writing this review because that guy was so fun and so on the ball it compelled me to give a scout out to him. I highly recommend seeking this guy out if he's there. He made the experience fun, fast and memorable."
