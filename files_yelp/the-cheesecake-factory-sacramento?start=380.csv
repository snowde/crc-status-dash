S R.,"Folsom, CA",3,114,257,1.0,10/8/2015,Ordered herb grilled salmon which arrived raw.  According to waiteress it was grilled. No sign of fish having  been grilled. Looked to be marinated fish that was thrown in microwave. If i wanted raw fish i would order sushi. People sitting at the next table told me this is how the salmon always is so they no longer order it with salmon being so expensive. I didn't want to send it back to the kitchen in case they spit init and bring it back to me after reheating it.  ....Do NOT order the SALMON !! ... Service could have been better. Waitress treated me like it was first time i was eating out when i questioned how fish was cooked because it was raw. Delivering drinks without straw.
CarmaTag C.,"Sacramento, CA",0,16,13,4.0,1/23/2016,Menu has so many things to choose from that all look good. Favorite entree so far has to be the ribeye steak. Favorite thing period is the strawberry shortcake. Only reason not giving 5 stars is that it's always really crowded.
Shor T.,"Seattle, WA",27,46,106,4.0,10/5/2014,"You get a bit of everything here. I tried the Monte Cristo sandwich for breakfast...I wanted to try something different, especially for brunch. It was alright...it was too huge for me to finish. It was different indeed for me...as the the French toast was a little crunchy but not bad. There was a hint of sweetness that complimented the saltiness from the bacon and ham. I don't plan to order that dish again...I'll keep exploring. As for desserts...I don't come here for the cheesecakes, I come here for the tiramisu cake, rather than the cheesecake.  cheesecakes are way too rich for me however I will indulge in a few bites of the Red Velvet Cheesecake once in awhile...if somebody else orders it and so kindly shares their piece ;-)."
Lisa E.,"Sacramento, CA",2,14,7,5.0,12/28/2016,"Love the Cheesecake Factory at this location!!  Had lunch there today before seeing a movie at the new theater nearby.  We were greeted by a few young women, unfortunately did not get their names, but were very congenial and Celia was our waitress who gave us top notch service.  Although, they were pretty busy when we arrived, only had to wait around 15 to 20 minutes, had a Cosmo (which was great--actually had sufficient Vodka in it, unlike other places) while we waited in the bar. My husband and I split the ""Louisiana Chicken Pasta""(bow tie pasta, kind of spicy but very good, breaded chicken cooked perfect) one of our favorites that we usually order & large enough to split and not go hungry.  Our daughter had the ""Veggie Melt"" and her boyfriend had the ""Cajun Jambalaya Pasta"" both entrees looked really good and they (daughter & boyfriend) said both were excellent.  We are regulars here and I would have to say to the managers at this particular restaurant, that they are doing a wonderful job, great service, excellent food (and please don't change the chefs whoever they are, food is outstanding!)  Will be back soon!!"
Qeyomi B.,"Sacramento, CA",1,5,6,5.0,11/14/2015,Outing with my daughter I had the Cajun jambalaya shrimp chicken pasta she had that chicken Alfredo had great service.
Demesha J.,"Millbrae, CA",9,88,45,4.0,5/9/2016,I love all Cheesecake Factory restaurants so I'm a little bias. Lol. The service was really good and of course the food is bomb. My know issue is the portion sizes are getting smaller.
Jasmin A.,"Winters, CA",3,28,28,5.0,6/6/2014,"love, love, looove coming to Cheesecake Factory. My husband & I Celebrated our anniversary here, and we were so happy. Our server was very attentive and took great care of us.  Food was DELICIOUS!!!! I order the same entree every time we come here & for some reason, it tasted so much better this time, than any other time.  My husband was also happy with everything so that made everything else even better!  We love Cheesecake Factory & we will be coming back!"
Gregg R.,"Sacramento, CA",469,321,2621,3.0,7/13/2012,"Sometimes I wonder why this place is so busy all the time? The food is good, not great. I think it's because the portions are usually huge, but keep in mind, also loaded with calories. Nonetheless . The wife wanted to go and I obliged. Started with a $9.50 Sangria which was pretty watered down or cut with a mixer, or the ice. Sucked that down in about 2 min. Then had the chopped chicken salad which was very nice and refreshing. Be sure to get the dressing on the side. The main part of the meal was the Hibachi steak. Very flavorfull, but tiny portions of actual meat. Now I remember why everyone comes here. Duh, the cheesecake! Red velvet and Tiramisu cheesecake were the bomb. Exactly how many Calories did I consume in one meal?"
Leonard A.,"Sacramento, CA",244,154,1437,5.0,3/8/2014,"My best friend took me here for my birthday dinner.  It was a busy Friday night, but service and food were excellent! We ordered mostly appetizers in order to have multiple tastings, and each dish was spectacular.  None of the dishes we ordered lacked in taste and flavor.  5 Stars!!! Fire Roasted Chile Relleno:  Extra Yumm-O!  This was my favorite dish of the night.  I love Chile Rellenos which I order frequently when I go to a Mexican restaurant, but the dish at Cheesecake Factory was heightened to another level and one of the best I have tasted.  It was crispy and flavorful.  There was also a hint of mild heat which I enjoy.  Fried Macaroni and Cheese:  I'm not a fan of Mac & Cheese, but these fried cheese balls were filled with perfectly cooked pasta and cheesy deliciousness. Roasted Pear and Blue Cheese:  Sweet and tangy flavor over a thin crust of crispy flat bread. Crispy Crab Bites:  Yumm-O!  What can I say? Mahi Mahi & Shrimp Vera Cruz:  My friend ordered an entree from the SkinnyLicious Menu.  The fish and shrimp were perfectly cooked, and the flavor profile for the entire dish was superb.  Perfect dish as an appetizer for two if you're sharing. Aside from the food, it was amazing to watch how the employees were coordinating with each other to get a table set up for the next customer.  Efficient and flawless!  Take time to observe these worker bees in action if you have not already because they work hard to make our experience pleasant.  Way to go, Cheesecake Factory!"
Jeremy S.,"Sacramento, CA",0,10,,4.0,6/24/2017,"Dined in last night at about 9:45, our waitresses name was Lisa, if I remember correctly. She was an excellent waitress, she visited our table a handful of times throughout the dining experience. She wasn't overwhelming nor was she leaving anything to be desired. I made sure to ask her name and tell her myself she was a great waitress. The food is always good here, I feel they're a bit on the pricey side, but oh well, I keep coming back don't I? My girlfriend got the Cajun jambalaya pasta and I got the pepperoni pizza. She said her dish was fine and mine was okay it's not that it wasn't made good, but it wasn't made to my particular liking. I'm more of a thicker crust, a bit more sauce, lighter cheese kind of guy. I typically get their spicy buffalo chicken sandwich and it's always perfect, but this time I tried something different, so now I know to go with my usual entree. Like I said, the pizza wasn't bad at all, it's just not how I like my pizza. Let me note that this particular trip here was 5 stars, but the reason I am giving 4 stars overall is because my first time being here a couple years back I was with a couple friends and I felt like we were being profiled based on appearance (tattoos, baggy clothes, etc.) So that definitely left a bad taste in my mouth for a while then I decided to give it a second go-round and have been satisfied ever since. I like to come here at least once a month or bi-weekly now since I decided to give it another try. So keep up the good work and thanks for a great dining experience, Lisa."
Lisa O.,"Sacramento, CA",40,15,1,1.0,1/9/2016,"This was the first time I've ever been to the Cheesecake Factory and it will be my only time.  Awful food and rude waitress. I ordered the fish and chips, no flavor, all grease.  The boyfriend ordered some chicken crusted dish. Was soaked in grease also. Looked like chicken in a plate of soup. We've never been there so it took us a few minutes to go through the food covered menus. The waiter she kept coming back within a few minutes ""are you ready? The menu is only 20 pages long""  both dishes went back with only a few bites taken out. No better feeling. The waitress also said the fish is fresh daily.  Which is not true. The only positive about this visit the manager  refused to let us pay and apologized for serving bad food.  All in all, food is not worth the wait."
Hi I'm Cameron F.,"Sacramento, CA",0,2,,2.0,1/18/2016,"In  my attempt to find a place that was open later on a Sunday and served a wide variety of foods we ended up here.I wanted to go to the Porch,... The Food ar Cheesecake Factory generally consists of frozen and fried.They plate the food for the most part.Frozen,fried foods.There is no ""whole foods"" going on back there.The chef's quickly add on the fresh veggies. We orders several appetizers/small plates. We had an order of Chicken pot stickers,and an order of their spin on a Cubano sandwich,fried and presented  like a spring roll, served with some sort of  mayo dip.We had their Samosas,Vietnamese shrimp summer rolls, and I ordered a Beets with goat cheese salad. We ordered various entrées. I felt bad for my sister in law,eating fish at that place.I would ONLY eat fresh fish.I'm just saying! The issue with the cake and the service! There is no need to say on your birthday,you just want to relax and have a nice evening with your family and friends.You have a  service expectation.When you manage to make everyone  want to leave,that's just not the experience you signed up for. We had a special bithday cake made at a bakery in Oakland,a Tres Leche cake.Nearly any restaurant will charge a fee if you bring outside food or drink. No problem! However,they are still supposed  to serve it to us!  My parents gave the cake with basic instructions,. (Like, please serve this ), and our name on it when we arrived.My family spoke with our waitress as we were seated. I have ate there several times.I have had 2 bad dining experiences there.This was by far the worst of both negative dining experiences there. After dinner,we waited for approximately 30 minutes talking,waiting.I was nervous  they would sing happy birthday to me.No cake came.No waitress.Finally my mom checked,  and they forgot about the cake.They brought the orders of  strawberries we ordered.Some of our party wanted ice cream and she never came back.My father wanted to complain to managment but I just wanted to leave. For nearly a 30 minutes we sat there talking,no one asked if we wanted coffee,or any other dessert items.She did not come to check on us once.We would question if they were get the cake and then that turned into did she forget about the cake.Again,she did not come back to check on us.My mom had to fo find somone. The cake was dropped of at our table.It was not cut, nor did they give us anything to cut the cake with, or clean plates.They should have brought the cake over,on a cake tray, OUT of the box.Or, asked us if they were not sure.An apology for our wait and for their mistake would have been apprexiated.This qualifies for HORRIBLE SERVICE. I will say this,typically their service is better than this.I have had pretty good service.This is my second encounter with a lousy waitress or waiter there,but she was by far the worst.She certainly needs more training,but the manager/supervisor also needs to be aware of what is going on in the restaurant too. The service of the waitress was rude.I noticed it right away She was not friendly,she had an attitude.She dis not check on us.She did not ask us if we wanted more of the bread.She seemed very distracted.Her service not only did not meet my expectations,for my birthday.She managed to upset everyone there,with her rude personality,lack of service as no show, for my cake as we waited. No one ordered drinks of more deserts when they finally appeared.They  just wantes to have the cake and LEAVE.Everyone was angry that she forgot to give us the cake and kept us waiting. Food,frozen and fried.This okay plated frozen foods.There is no ""whole foods"" going on back there.

No more Cheesecake Factory.DONE. 2 stars for previous good service,but the stars are also a reflection of terrible service.The service realy matters.It was my birthday.You forgot to bring my cake! Really?!"
Kemi K.,"Sacramento, CA",0,20,6,1.0,2/24/2016,Don't come here. They brought my Cajun pasta with the chicken over cooked and the shrimp undercooked and I mentioned it to the waitress and took it back and someone else thought a soggy probably spit on meal to me and I couldn't even bother to eat it. I should have told my boyfriend to not pay for it because it was repulsive. I initially didn't even want to go to this location because It's not a quality spot from what I've heard and I'm use to the one in Natomas in north Sacramento and after that experience I will never return and if I didn't have better things to do I would create 100 Yelp accounts to give them 1 star because that's what they deserve. Very unprofessional..
Olga G.,"Sacramento, CA",3,5,1,5.0,11/22/2015,My experience in Cheesecake Factory was really great! I ordered from Skinylicious menu shrimp tacos and they were so delicious and healthy! My husband ordered Shepherd's pie and he was more than satisfied! Also I need to mention that the service was on the very high level. Amazing and very good place with big portions and delicious food!
Nick G.,"Sacramento, CA",137,1,,2.0,9/3/2016,"The service here was decent but the reason ultimately why I gave this location 3 stars was because the employees were RUDE..snobby and just is a bad mood in general was what it seemed like with almost every one of them I had encountered, I am writing this review as I am sitting in their booth because of how agitated I am.."
Stefanie W.,"Sacramento, CA",147,26,45,2.0,2/9/2014,"Very disappointed in the service my family and I received here. They sat us at a booth and because of my fathers two knee replacement surgeries, a table would have better accommodated our needs. After explaining this to our waiter, he had us standing for over 5 minutes in center of restaurant, then walked us to a SECOND booth not understanding our need for a table. (The restaurant was nowhere near busy having over 10 tables available).  Food was good; dessert chocolate tuxedo cheesecake was amazing. Would rather not return to this specific location."
Monique D.,"Sacramento, CA",0,1,,5.0,1/2/2017,Great food great service. Our server  was Tim usually I try to sit with him if he's working. My favorite server always has a smile and get energy this time I went in I saw him behind the bar so we sat at the bar top. It was like dinner and a show watching him make drinks. The Miso salmon he recommended and the mojito  he made us was so good . Will keep coming here for a long time
Mike G.,"Woodland, CA",0,47,33,5.0,11/27/2016,Food is always super fast and good we got the flat bread my daughter had the butter noodles how can you go wrong with a piece of there cheesecake yummy
Paul C.,"Sacramento, CA",8,37,4,5.0,5/16/2016,What to say it was bomb simple as that had the Chicken Madeira and it was awesome considering I wouldn't really order chicken as my first choice but one of the waiters recommend it and had to try it and glad I did. Also I had the fresh strawberry cheesecake and that too was awesome service was good always on top of everything overall great first experience.
Cella S.,"Davis, CA",221,18,3,1.0,11/16/2015,"I ordered a fettuccine alfredo with shrimp on the side to share and a hibiscus lemonade. The food tasted alright. Only complaint, it came out pretty quick, which raised suspicion that it was made ahead of time and not fresh whatsoever.  I found a HAIR in my bread. That made me lose appetite.  I also sat down in a pile of crumbs and disliked how the silverware was on the table. Why? Didn't seem very sanitary. ALSO, our waitress (a white girl with a tie way to long) gave no fucks and was sarcastic throughout our time spent there. Customer service from her was shitty.  Tipped. Would have tipped a lot more if our waitress didn't suck at her job so badly. Would come here again? NOPE. Edit: Looking at my receipt, the server's name was Brittney R. Thanks for not making my stay enjoyable on my aniversery with my boyfriend."
S R.,"Folsom, United States",3,114,257,1.0,8/10/2015,Ordered herb grilled salmon which arrived raw.  According to waiteress it was grilled. No sign of fish having  been grilled. Looked to be marinated fish that was thrown in microwave. If i wanted raw fish i would order sushi. People sitting at the next table told me this is how the salmon always is so they no longer order it with salmon being so expensive. I didn't want to send it back to the kitchen in case they spit init and bring it back to me after reheating it.  ....Do NOT order the SALMON !! ... Service could have been better.

Stefanie W.,"Sacramento, United States",147,26,45,2.0,9/2/2014,"Very disappointed in the service my family and I received here. They sat us at a booth and because of my fathers two knee replacement surgeries, a table would have better accommodated our needs. After explaining this to our waiter, he had us standing for over 5 minutes in center of restaurant, then walked us to a SECOND booth not understanding our need for a table. (The restaurant was nowhere near busy having over 10 tables available).  Food was good; dessert chocolate tuxedo cheesecake was amazing. Would rather not return to this specific location."
Monique D.,"Sacramento, United States",0,1,,5.0,2/1/2017,Great food great service. Our server  was Tim usually I try to sit with him if he's working. My favorite server always has a smile and get energy this time I went in I saw him behind the bar so we sat at the bar top. It was like dinner and a show watching him make drinks. The Miso salmon he recommended and the mojito  he made us was so good . Will keep coming here for a long time

Paul C.,"Sacramento, United States",8,37,4,5.0,16/5/2016,What to say it was bomb simple as that had the Chicken Madeira and it was awesome considering I wouldn't really order chicken as my first choice but one of the waiters recommend it and had to try it and glad I did. Also I had the fresh strawberry cheesecake and that too was awesome service was good always on top of everything overall great first experience.
Cella S.,"Davis, United States",221,18,3,1.0,16/11/2015,"I ordered a fettuccine alfredo with shrimp on the side to share and a hibiscus lemonade. The food tasted alright. Only complaint, it came out pretty quick, which raised suspicion that it was made ahead of time and not fresh whatsoever.  I found a HAIR in my bread. That made me lose appetite.  I also sat down in a pile of crumbs and disliked how the silverware was on the table. Why? Didn't seem very sanitary. ALSO, our waitress (a white girl with a tie way to long) gave no fucks and was sarcastic throughout our time spent there. Customer service from her was shitty.  Tipped. Would have tipped a lot more if our waitress didn't suck at her job so badly. Would come here again? NOPE. Edit: Looking at my receipt, the server's name was Brittney R. Thanks for not making my stay enjoyable on my aniversery with my boyfriend."
