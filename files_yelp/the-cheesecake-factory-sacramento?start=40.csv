Trang N.,"Sacramento, CA",3,17,10,1.0,11/10/2017,"We stopped by for some appetizers and dessert. I ordered a cucumber mojito. I looked down and saw a caterpillar on one of the mint leaves. Bartender and waitress showed no sympathy or understanding. I wonder if this is common here at the restaurant?  Then I proceeded and asked for a sprite. First glass the soda was flat, second glass...by then I was too nervous to trust the bartender."
Don H.,"Sonoma, CA",0,109,126,4.0,10/21/2017,"Never had a bad meal at any cheesecake factory  and this place did not disappoint me. Great service and delicious food. If you want to try something different, ask for the celebration cake."
Cyn T.,"Oakland, CA",52,293,946,3.0,3/8/2017,It's probably not a good idea to go to a lot of restaurants late. They run out of food. I think we were trying to get the firecracker salmon rolls and the sausage & ricotta Flatbread. They were out of both. Ugg. We ended up getting the fried chicken sliders which were heavenly. We also has the crab wontons. They took forever to arrive. I thought they had to send out a boat to find some crab. Ha ha It was cool though. We were hungry and mostly tired so we weren't too bothered.  Our waiter was Brandon. He said he just finished training. He was cool and very apologetic through our long waits for food. We frequent this location enough to know we'll be back. One thing I can say is their service isn't consistent...yet I keep going...Hmmm.
Jennifer M.,"Sacramento, CA",135,134,595,5.0,8/13/2016,"Friday nite, Good eats and Allison a sure way to enjoy an evening. The house was packed, the wait 22 minutes that was eased by a generous pour at the bar. We began plotting our course as we waited to be seated. I love the HD screens displaying speciality dishes and the front row view to all that CHEESCAKE at the entrance. After a greatly anticipated table we were excited to get situated and order the Buffalo Chicken Blasts!  Allison  was with us from hello till goodbye..She was amazing. My husband was feeling ambitious and decided to have Allison and her expert crew choose his meal. After quick vote and the consent of the chef a delicious lemony, crispy, tender chicken costeletta was served.  I opted for a delicious dinner salad that was sub par compared to those Buffalo Chicken Blasts....OMG!  All in all it was another enjoyable evening at our local Cheesecake Factory"
Leslie D.,"Sacramento, CA",66,2,1,1.0,8/7/2017,"Embarrassingly disappointed. It was family tradition to dine here for my birthday celebration every year (since I was 18, I'm 22 now), but I'm sad to say it's time for a change. The wait was exactly 30 mins so not mad about that, but it all started going downhill when the lady seated us at our table pulling a chair out into the middle of the walkway when I preferred sitting on the booth side so I had to push the chair back in and make my way to the booth.. not a big deal just annoying. Then our server came by and we ordered drinks and you guessed it, he totally forgot mine. I just knew he should've taken notes before he even left the table. I still gave the server the benefit of the doubt and assumed he was new and poorly trained.  20 mins after waiting for the server to take down our order, we waited a whole 45 mins before food got to us.. and it wasn't even our food. This lady came to our table with fried macaroni like no, not us but seriously where's our food. Quit playing. One guy literally had 1 table and kept passing them multiple times.. seriously a waste of productivity. It was so unorganized like did all the managers and experienced workers go on vacation or.  Another 15 mins later, entres come out.. before appetizers. Now I'm not even mad anymore, just confused. So let's talk about the entre, farfalle specifically terrible there was a piece of string cheese in it, looked more like a lunch potion than a dinner one trust me I would know since that is the only thing I get from this place. Got charged for the farfalle with chicken when I got it without the chicken, makes no sense. Okay appetizers, don't recommend any of them: tater tots, fried zucchini, nachos all a big thumbs down. I mean factory nachos were a go-to until they burned it.. like how does that happen? The chips were brown, anyone could see that even under the dim light. Yet the server, Theodore who insisted we call him Teddy, (firstly you aren't sweet nor cute like a Teddy so no one is going to call you that) even questioned me like wth, dumb (bleep) you eat it then mf.  Then dessert time rolled around and we would've gotten cheesecakes but unfortunately I was nervous about waiting another hour or Theodore not getting the order right, so we paid our dues and ran for our lives."
Elisha W.,"Sacramento, CA",0,7,4,4.0,12/5/2017,"I'd been wanting to visit the Cheesecake Factory for a while, but never got around to it until today. Usually, there is a line outside when I drive by on weekends, but it was a weekday, so not too busy. There was a 10 minute wait, but that wasn't bad, considering I've waited way too long at other restaurants that weren't worth the wait. Our servers were friendly and I got a birthday song. Also got a complimentary sundae with a candle! The food was delicious and left us all stuffed. Which saddened me because if you're visiting here, you want to taste the cheesecake. I couldn't eat any there, but bought two pieces to enjoy at home. I've only had a forkful of the key lime cheesecake and I can see why this place is so popular. Was a bit pricy, but less than $100 for 3 people and extra cheesecake is pretty nice.  Only thing that was bad was a friend of mine ordered a burger well done, but she got it rare. It wasn't a problem to send it back, though. Would definitely come again!"
Dev R.,"Long Beach, CA",131,640,2145,5.0,10/17/2016,We came late night and sat in the bar to eat a meal. Excellent service.  Par excellent food!
Peggy R.,"Sacramento, CA",19,4,2,5.0,2/28/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite restaurants so when my brother invited me for brunch I was really excited. I had been to different locations at least 10-15 times, but never to the one in Sacramento, so I wanted to know  what all the fuzz was about. I had to go to the bathroom as soon as I arrived, and I must say that it was really dirty and there were no paper towels. After returning from the bathroom, I saw that my brother had not been seated yet (everything was full). We had to wait for about 45 minutes. I ended up ordering Chicken Madeira, and to be honest it wasn't that great. The sauce poor all over the chicken was to sweet (I think I could have had it for dessert). I will probably come back to this chain restaurant but not to this specific location."
Tila T.,"Sacramento, CA",339,393,447,3.0,8/8/2016,"Huge portions, but overall, a lot on the salty side. My go-to's are the meatloaf and the chicken madiera. i do not recommend the shrimp scampi pasta (overcooked shrimp, cold pasta). Make sure to drink lots of water in between. The starter bread here is the best!!  You must order cheesecake when at the factory. the classic strawberry cheesecake is scrumptious, especially when paired with the fresh-made whipped creme. Omg - droolz**."
Diane J.,"Cardiff by the Sea, CA",25,81,,5.0,11/9/2017,"I ordered the Tuscan Chicken off the Skinnylicious menu and it was wonderful.  Three small chicken breasts were cooked to just the right degree; no worries about pinkish meat but still juicy and delicious.  I know from experience that it can be tough not to overcook those thinner cuts!  The plate was also chock full of flavorful roasted tomatoes.  It comes with farro, but as readers of my previous reviews are probably tired of hearing, I am (still) going low carb, so I ignored the grain on the plate.  Our server Brent was friendly and accommodating.  I was there with 4 colleagues who all coveted the brown bread.  Brent replenished the basket cheerfully (and I managed to resist helping myself.)  One of my party did find her burger to be undercooked, but as she had ordered it well done (yuck!), I am not sure if it was matter of the kitchen getting it wrong or the customer having extreme tastes.  Everyone else was very happy with their orders- a chicken salad sandwich, wings and fries and a Chinese chicken salad, respectively.  Brent didn't blink an eye at the request for separate checks, which we needed in order to submit for reimbursement.  I will definitely visit this location if I'm in the area again."
Sanz E.,"Pinole, CA",270,104,121,3.0,3/6/2017,"Chain restaurants don't usually have a high bar to begin with. But this particular location at this particular time was even below that bar.  First, they were out of bread. Then when I went to order an appetizer, the server told me to pause because had to check if they had it. So I asked him, keep it simple, let me know what you don't have so I can know what not to order. He comes back out and the list is pretty long (17 items). Someone somewhere messed up and didn't order  correctly to keep their inventory full. The server told us they were out of most of the items by noon.  Both steak Diane's came with so many mushrooms, we had to brush them off to find the steak. At least it was cooked as requested (medium). The fries our table ordered were salty.  They would have gotten 2 stars if it wasn't for our server who tried his best to make up for the restaurants shortcomings."
Parker H.,"Santa Cruz, CA",0,6,2,1.0,12/29/2017,Worst burger I've ever had plus shitty service. Started off ordered a burger and added cheese to it. I was patiently waiting for my burger and was wondering where the hot bread was and never received it. I haven't been here in a while so I thought they stopped serving it but noticed on other tables around me that they had bread. So sitting there starving with just water at the table about 20 minutes goes by which isn't bad my burger comes out and it has lettuce and tomato on one side of the bun and the burger on the other side which looks like a piece of charcoal just burnt with NO CHEESE. I flagged down the waitress told her that the burger didn't have cheese and she said the burger I ordered doesn't come with cheese and I specifically added cheese to the original order which she forgot I did and remembered when I reminded her. She walks away I continue to eat my fries and my dried up burger that no one wants even at a BBQ just sitting there waiting for cheese finally the waitress brings out a slice of cheese on a hot plate that's partially melted to the plate and have to peel it off and put it on my cold burger that's been sitting there for a good 15 minutes and my fries were gone in the process of waiting. So instead of getting a new hot burger she gave me a flimsy piece of Macdonald's cheese to put on a cold burger. I was so hungry I ate it anyway and it was completely disgusting had no flavor and was cold and burnt. After I ate the nasty burger they brought out bread I mean really ? Too little too late. My girlfriend gave a one dollar tip which I told her to put 0 but her pasta dish was okay. I'm sorry but Cheesecake Factory sucks the service sucks and the food is over priced. The only reason why I went there is because of a gift card we had. I can make a burger 1000 times better than the piece of burnt bs I had. I definitely won't be going back. Terrible
Joser P.,"Sacramento, CA",106,82,222,4.0,8/3/2017,"This was the second time I have came here and this time was much better. The first time I went, I remember the food being not so good, and leaving the restaurant smelling like old cheese. This time, I ordered a few appetizers that were really good. I got the crab ragoons and something else that I forgot. Both were worth the price.  For my main course, I got the bacon burger. It was sooo good! They include huge pieces of bacon on it. I was so full I saved the other half for later, which was great reheated."
Ricky M.,"Sacramento, CA",76,127,463,5.0,8/13/2016,"Allison was our waitress. From the start it  was like she was hoping for a challenge, willing to go the extra mile. like she just wanted us to be happy.  I had the crispy chicken costoletta. It melted in my mouth like cotton candy. These three lightly breaded chicken delights were on point! I usually don't get the chicken dish. Normally a dry affair, this was nothing like that. Even the red mashed potatoes were killer. Growing up we had mashed potatoes often. It kinda burned me out on it. So when I come across some that I want more of, it's really saying something.  If you haven't been to The Cheesecake Factory your missing out! When you walk in its obviously a little upper scale. Big screen monitors showing menu items while you wait for a table. By the time you get to your table you kinda already know what you want. An if you are lucky enough to get Allison. You will be in for a real treat."
Umar G.,"Turlock, CA",91,257,22,3.0,8/3/2017,"Standard looking cheese cake factory with (what im assuming is) safe Americana. We just went in for the cheesecake . My raspberry truffle is chilling in the 'fridge, but did get a few bites of the hubby's caramel cheesecake . Maybe im getting older ... but i found it to be too sweet and the crust not crisp or complementary enough. Im hoping the raspberry truffle doesn't disappoint. In my younger years, when I'd had a particularly bad day,  I'd end up at cheesecake,  order a dry,  dry gin martini and a slice of the raspberry truffle... always managed to make the world more tolerable ."
Christy L.,"Sacramento, CA",1,17,,4.0,11/21/2017,"I have avoided Cheesecake Factory for years due to their gigantic phone book of a menu. A friend suggested we try it again... Wonderful!!! Our waiter Deandre (the man of many names; De, Dre,Andre). So friendly, personable and he will definitely be our waiter from now on!"
Sam T.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,1,,1.0,12/27/2017,"I am usually very patient when it comes to waiting for food and to-go orders, especially when it is very busy. But a few days ago, I had a pretty frustrating experience. I got in line at the bakery to pay for my pre-ordered cheesecake. Once I got to the register, I was told I had to pay for it at a different register in the front. Given, there was an 8×11 hand written piece of paper stating that is where we pay for it, but unless you really stop to read everything you won't see it. So I went to pay for it, went back to the other register to make sure they saw my receipt and order and then waited. Understanding it was Christmas Eve day i figured it would take a while but more than 30 minutes go by and everyone who paid after me had already left. I went to ask about it and got my cheesecake within less than 5 minutes. Their explanation for the delay: there were 2 of the same cheesecakes sitting out there for a while with no names on it so no one did anything about it. Next time, put a sign where it's visible to everyone standing in line so they know not to pay there and if theres food/dessert sitting out for a while then figure out where it goes. Especially if you see someone sitting there longer than they have to."
Addison M.,"Sacramento, CA",1476,395,439,1.0,7/30/2017,1/2 a star  The service was dismal. The food was ok. The atmosphere was busy. But where should I start? I mean they said the wait was 35 minutes but that changed to about 45 quick. We got sat down and the waitress promptly and introduce yourself and asked if we wanted anything to drink. She came back about 10 minutes later with all of our drinks but the lighting seem to have gotten darker and it infuriated us. So we asked her if we could turn up the lighting and she asked management and she came back and it turns out that the lights were on a timer? So my party had to use it's flashlights on our phones to see the menu and even when the food came but the food was good especially the cheesecake for dessert but we were very upset that we could not have the lighting turned up :( we sat there for about 15 minutes with empty water glasses and when we asked for more water the waitress came back and it seemed like the water was from tap and not cold at all.
Karen R.,"Elk Grove, CA",54,46,45,4.0,4/22/2017,"Came in on a Saturday night. Super packed. We had a group of 5 with a 35 minute wait.  We started with appetizers, they were delicious!  The spinach dip & chips is a MUST ($12). So is the cheesy garlic bread ($10) I'm very impressed.  Next time I'll just order appetizers instead of dinner.  For dinner I had the Steak Diana plate cooked medium ($20). The sauce included caramelized onions and mushrooms. The plate came with the steak already cut up into small chunks and a buttery mashed potatoes. My plate was a solid 5 star meal.  It wasn't dry at all, just all around juicy. And the portion was just right.  My mom ordered the Chicken Marsala($19) and she enjoyed the chicken, but she didn't like the pasta it came with. My dad ordered the Carne Asada medallions ($15)  and it came with rice and corn. He also said he enjoyed his plate but he expected a more flavor. My brother has the Chicken fettuccine Alfredo ($20) and it was a decent portion. Clearly, there was no room for dessert so we all ordered a cheesecake to go. They were all a huge $8 slice.  In the end we ordered 4 cokes ($4 each) , 2 appetizers, 4 dinner plates, & 3 cheesecakes and the total came out to $145.00. I personally thought it was a lot of money for a restaurant that super fancy or anything, but again the food was good. So I would totally come here again but only for a special occasion like a birthday or anniversary or something. It just seems a little over the top to pay $145 for 4 people to have dinner (my own opinion of course). Hence my 4 star rating. I wouldn't come just to have a week night dinner.  The pricing here is a little too much for me.  Also, our server, Jamad was great. Very very friendly and despite the busyness he had going on, he did check on us and make sure we were all satisfied at all times. Thank you Jamad (-:"
Victoria B.,"Roseville, CA",125,3,4,2.0,9/7/2017,"Disappointing to say the least. Food was subpar. I personally got the crab cake bites, which tasted terrible. The waiter didn't even ask if we enjoyed our food. It was obvious they were understaffed. I felt bad for our waiter who had way more tables than one could handle. Took forever to even get the bread, let alone our food. The fries we got were hardly warm and you could tell they had been sitting for a while. I will never be back."
