Sergey K.,"Roseville, CA",3,21,8,1.0,3/28/2016,Terrible costumer service there was a table ready but no server was there to take us they were also very rude to us.
John H.,"Sacramento, CA",0,4,,1.0,1/1/2017,"Terrible service, terrible food both hamburger and bacon served raw...also mustard and crab,not a good mix"
Steph M.,"Sacramento, CA",735,253,2306,3.0,2/7/2015,"Mediocre and OVERPRICED American food. Ordered the spaghetti with meatballs tonight and it was $14.95... not sure how a simple dish like that could cost so much! The portion wasn't even big enough to share (three meatballs and a bit of noodles in a NON-MEAT based marinara sauce...) and now I'm regretting not ordering their Kobe burger, also around $15 but probably more satisfying! Their spaghetti was sweet and the sausage meatballs were OK, but it wasn't anything spectacular. They DO have a ""Skinnylicious"" menu which offers healthy alternatives of their entrees (500 or fewer calories) but, in my opinion, all they do is cut portion sizes in half and charge a dollar or two less than what the original item costs--NOT WORTH IT! The free bread they give out is always GOOD (especially their brown bread)... just refrain from peeking at the nutritional facts! :P For actual FOOD, I'd rate them a 2/5--I've never been ""WOW'ed"" by their entrees/appetizers/brunch specials.  I would recommend ONLY coming here for dessert!! Their cheesecakes are DELICIOUS and they have so many to choose from you're bound to find something you like! They even offer non-cheesecake items including; tiramisu, carrot cake, warm apple crisp, Linda's fudge cake, black-out cake, chocolate tower truffle cake, strawberry shortcake, and lemoncello cream tortes. My favorite cheesecakes are the 30th Anniversary chocolate cake (original cheesecake, fudge cake, and chocolate truffle cream), white chocolate raspberry truffle, fresh banana cream cheesecake (banana cheesecake topped with bavarian cream and freshly slices bananas), their original cheesecake with strawberry toppings, and their dutch apple caramel streusel (their original cheesecake, baked apples, and a caramel and brown sugar walnut streusel). I've tried their low-carb original cheesecake with strawberries which is sweetened with Splenda and, in my opinion, if you're going to indulge in cheesecake you might as well stick to the ORIGINAL! Cheat meals are OK every once in a while anyways so treat yourself! :)  For cheesecakes I'd rate them a 4/5.   Our waiter, Andrew, was really nice and gave good suggestions on what cheesecakes to order. He was attentive without coming off as being annoying. The service here is always pretty good! (5/5). I'd rate the overall cleanliness of the restaurant a 4/5, their lighting is so dim it's hard to tell what's clean and what isn't. The restaurant itself is very modern and nice for date nights when you're looking to go somewhere slightly upscale and ""safe."" I say ""safe"" because they have a lot of menu items to choose from, anywhere from your typical pizza, pasta, burgers and fries to salmon, salads, and steaks, and portion sizes are usually HUGE so you can always share. Overall, I'd only come back here to PICK-UP cheesecakes versus actually dining in!"
Jennifer A.,"Roseville, CA",94,21,7,2.0,7/3/2016,Omg this has the worst Service And take for ever for drinks and food I say it's rated 2 stars
Carolyn B.,"Sacramento, CA",2,68,,5.0,8/5/2015,"Well...went back to Cheesecake Factory today....after all, it is Cream of Mushroom soup Wednesday !!  UNBEATABLE. Service and Server was excellent.  Thank you."
Raquel V.,"Sacramento, CA",14,98,140,4.0,8/21/2015,For the most part the food was ok. The stuffed mushrooms unfortunately we're a bit raw and the drinks have a little to much ice.
Andi K.,"Los Angeles, CA",56,47,148,3.0,8/16/2015,"Food is delicious.  I had shepherd's pie. Unfortunately it uses beef instead of lamb. Wife had bbq pk sandwich. Really tasty however, our server paul, it's pretty rude. My friends got upset  from his treatment. I wish the manager pay more attention to their server. Busy night, shouldn't be the reason for being lack of service, rude, n bad attitude  Cause by the end of the day you do expect to get a good tip, right?! What a shame, nice place, tasty food, bad server. Next time I just bring my business to maggiano, or season 52. They seems more appreciate customer than this place."
Alyssa B.,"Elk Grove, CA",194,75,12,2.0,5/26/2015,"Okay, so usually the customer service is great here until I arrived last night with my boyfriend and our two friends.  Once we entered, we were greeted by the hostess, which was great. Then once we got seated was when the horrible service happened. We had no idea who our waiter was. All I know if that some guy served us water. I asked for a lemon in mines, didn't get it. Whatever. And then our so called ""waiter"" never came back. We were ready to order and we had to ask another guy to take our order, so he took our order and he said ""I'll let your waiter Elijah know"" (I think that was his name, I don't know)..... Like okay?  And once we got our meal was when our ""waiter"" decided to be involved, probably so he can redeem himself in order to get a tip...  Whatever.  Food is great, but was disappointed by the service."
Leslie P.,"Coto de Caza, CA",36,55,140,3.0,6/28/2014,"They are out of Ahi!!!!!! Nooooooooooooooo. The thing is, there is A LOT to choose from, something is bound to be good. So far the Thai Lettuce Wraps, the Calamari, the Crab dip, the crab cakes, the Ahi-poke App, all very good.  Everything else I have had there has been ok, nothing terrible.   Cheesecake has always been bomb, but it's like impossible to eat after the meal, definitely a take home dessert. I mean I love food, love it, plan my vacations around where we will eat, but by the end of the meal, I can only take one bite of the Cheesecake, it is so rich. So far my fave is the Coconut white chocolate one. Easy restaurant to please everyone in the group.  Will say also drinks are poured a little light, but the are kind of $$ anyway so we really don't go there to drink.   Also the service has usually been pretty good, only one bad experience, and I think she was having a bad day, otherwise pretty good."
Michelle C.,"Elk Grove, CA",1098,190,245,4.0,1/30/2015,I just can't express how much I like this place.  I'm long overdue for a review.  Visited last night for my nephew's birthday and we had a rather large party.  Service was outstanding.  I ordered something different that is not my usual style of ordering...the seared ahi salad.  It was sooooo delicious.  I had to get some of that dressing to go.  Everyone seemed pretty darn satisfied with their dinners.  And they let us bring in our own cake to top the birthday boys' night off.  I will be a faithful customer for a long time to come.
Jatin M.,"Sacramento, CA",50,151,5,2.0,6/8/2015,"Cheesecake Factory is just overrated. The food is too expensive for the quality you get. I got the chicken shrimp jambalaya which was like $20 but tasted like $5. If I were to go here again, I would do appetizers (the factory nachos are good!) and then go straight to dessert."
Prisa F.,"Fairfield, CA",24,22,12,5.0,2/12/2016,Went in to celebrate Valentine's Day. We only waited about 20 minutes for a table. I have to say the food was great. Service was excellent. Kalena was awesome. Great night!! Thank you Cheese Cake Factory !!!
Nicolle R.,"Sacramento, CA",0,1,,1.0,6/1/2016,Very pricey for what we ordered. Who serves French dip on a hamburger bun and the side salad was not edible. Maybe they need to just stick to making desserts.
Shavon W.,"Richmond, CA",0,19,60,3.0,7/29/2015,I would to give this place 5 stars but I am a little disappointed at my server Sarah M. She was great semi absent minded but good. However when it was time to get to go boxes she didn't ask if we wanted out food boxed like everyone in out section. I almost feel like it was a racist gesture. Every other race was boxed without a problem... Won't be coming back here. I've been to plenty of cheesecake factories and my food was boxed and bagged by the server in the bay area where I live. This was the first and last visit
Jeannett D.,"Carmichael, CA",304,9,1,1.0,5/12/2016,The service was crap from the moment we walked in. Didn't even sit the remaining of our group but pointed them in the direction. The hostess was rude and threw the menu in my hand. The waitress forgot drinks and bread and every time we needed something we had to ask and she was even worse than the other two. I've had better customer service at Home Depot.
Jacob C.,"Rocklin, CA",5,10,,5.0,12/19/2015,"I always enjoy a great slice of Cheesecake while dining at the Cheesecake Factory. Durning our recent visit the waitress was polite, prompt and fast. My drink never ran dry and the food was served hot and fast. The price of the quality of food is excellent. If you looking for an affordable meal the family I suggest this place."
Shel N.,"San Jose, CA",321,208,254,1.0,1/31/2014,"I have to have my herb crusted filet of salmon and steak diane combination plate at least once a month. I've been here twice and it's very disappointing. for some reason, they go really cheap on their portion size! ESPECIALLY their mash. i was completely out of the mash and i had loads of salmon and steak left over. i LOVE mash potatoes and it upsets me that they always give me basically nothing  so if youre a student that lives in the bay area and goes to school in sac, just save your cravings and wait when you go back home. sj location arden"
Amy F.,"Roseville, CA",3,42,43,5.0,6/18/2014,Every time I come here the food is always great a day service is really good. Recently I came here and ordered their tex mex egg rolls. My friends and I enjoyed them.  I like how there's black beans and sweet corn kernels in them along side with sour cream and Pico. Entrée wise I had their lunch size of the BBQ chicken salad.  That salad is one of my all time favorites.  The lunch size was extremely huge just like the dinner size.  I barely finished it.  Definitely your moneys worth.  To drink I had their Pina Colada. The drink was very presentable and easing to the eyes. It was pretty strong to me and I love the coconut exterior coating.  Our waitress was very attentive and nice.
Summer M.,"Sacramento, CA",462,768,1213,2.0,12/4/2013,"This is only my second time having ever eaten at a Cheesecake Factory. I'm not an ""ERMAHGERD, CHERSECAKE!"" type and chain restaurants in general don't excite me. (Plus, totally random, but the architectural style of their building bugs me. Tiles on the ceiling, Roman columns, Tuscan murals and Egyptian decor? What is this, an adult restaurant version of 'It's a Small World'?) But I was in the mood for a steak and this seemed to be the only reasonably-priced local restaurant open on a late Sunday night. We sat outside on the heated patio, which was delightfully quiet and uncrowded compared to inside. Man, that venue is always packed like they're giving away... well, cheesecake. The staff was attentive and friendly. The service was prompt. My friend got the Mushroom Burger and I got the Steak Diane. We enjoyed the food, everything tasted fine, and my white sangria cocktail was really good. We left with what seemed to be a good experience. Aaaand then 2 hours later we both got food poisoning. I had a nasty sour stomach, but my poor friend had chills/fever that night and was throwing up the whole next day. I will note that I did not get food poisoning the other time I ate there, but still... No bueno."
Paulamertha A.,"Suisun City, CA",287,472,617,4.0,9/11/2012,"I rarely go to cheesecake factory but when I do I usually have an amazing experience. The place is almost always packed on weekends and parking is a nightmare. They do offer valet parking for $3 if you don't want to bother hunting for a parking spot. Anyway, the waiter that I had for my recent trip to the Cheesecake Factory was awesome! He was very friendly, helpful, and knowledgable about the menu and the drinks at the bar. The food here is pretty good but nothing amazing, at least nothing that I've tried so far is mind blowing. To me, this is just a good spot for date night, for special occasions, or if you're meeting up with friends you haven't seen in a while. Overall, the place is pretty good and I'll most likely be going back pretty soon."
