Ashley M.,"Sacramento, CA",0,33,1,4.0,6/8/2016,"Husband ordered the Americana burger and I got the chicken and avocado sandwich. It was definitely good, I just hate when restaurants over pack my sandwiches so I can comfortably take a bite!! They used this awesome garlic and herb spread on the sand which and my husband said the special sauce on the burger was also good. I would say it's a bit pricey for what you get and I wish they would update their online menu prices! I hate going somewhere thinking I'm paying one thing and getting better charged more!! They have a great selection of cheesecakes too, $8 a slice is a bit rich for me, but when I do spoil myself it's white chocolate raspberry truffle for me!!!"
Ryan C.,"San Francisco, CA",118,166,196,5.0,1/3/2015,"I hate to say this but I was actually looking for reasons to give this place and all cheesecake factories less stars. But I can't. They have their niche. They are somewhere in a range above Olive Garden and below your local fine dining. They are not TGIF but they also are not that 5-star 2 month wait on reservations establishment.  Yes the menu can be overwhelming. Goodness gracious it's a novel. But they do capture something for everyone...from appetizers to entrees to delectable desserts and of course the best cheesecakes in the Western Hemisphere. The place can be cheesy (no pun intended), but it is a place where all walks of life can meet at neutral ground. While meeting at neutral they can enjoy great food, great drinks and yes again the best cheesecakes around.  The miso salmon, wasabi tuna, and the jambalaya pasta are killer. I try to stay away from this trifecta of deliciousness but I just can't. For the cheesecakes, just try them all. My favorite is the Dutch Apple and the pineapple upside down. So here I am I just can't find a way to knock this place down. So if you can't then enjoy it."
Charlie B.,"Sacramento, CA",9,3,,4.0,6/20/2016,"I have been here several times and I can't imagine why I haven't reviewed this place before. Last time I went I got a macaroni cheeseburger and it was pretty good. My favorite dish there is the salad with the spicy bbq ranch. You can't beat it. It's so good. Not really a fan of their pastas since they seem too creamy and rich. This is a solid location. My food always comes out hot when I take it to-go. The red velvet, s'mores and oreo cheesecake are to die for and if you care about good service, this place has the best. The staff there are friendly and nice. Other than the waiting time, everything else is perfect (well the white jeans the wait staff wears is not really perfect but who cares). It's a little overpriced, but I would definitely recommend."
Ashley C.,"Sacramento, CA",394,782,4199,5.0,5/1/2014,"Every time I come here, I receive really great service! I never have anything to complain about. The menu is like a novel so it's tough to pick something! That just means you have to come back a lot haha. The appetizers are great, I love the loaded tater tots. I get the spicy chicken chipotle pasta quite often. Lunchtime is a great time to go, they have lunch specials with huge portions! And of course always save room for dessert, it's the main event. I've liked every single cheesecake flavor I've tried so far... Oreo, banana cream, smores, raspberry, etc. You can't go wrong!"
Mayra H.,"West Sacramento, CA",50,3,,1.0,6/5/2016,"Whent out for dinner with my parents and son last weekend  we all had the steak diane and my son had the kids alfredo pasta. My son pasta was over cook and didn't have enough sause and our steak was over cook waited for the waiter to come by and she never did while we where eating so we decided to eat our dinner ,  We didn't even got ask if we wanted refills on our drinks . When it was time to pay the waitress finally came by and gave us our check waited and waited and she didnt show up so we decided to take the check up infront and when the waitress saw us getting up she finally came and took our card . WORST expirience ever"
Courtney R.,"Modesto, CA",3,65,5,5.0,1/16/2015,"This is the BEST Cheesecake Factory location I've ever been to. I've been to several and I always order the same item. The food here was by far superior to any other.  Even though I am not the biggest fan of chain restaurants, you can't go wrong at Cheesecake Factory. They really do pride themselves on good quality food and excellent customer service. Their menu is extensive and has something for everyone. If you're a meat lover, the steak Diane is absolutely mouth watering. If you're vegetarian, the tamale corn cakes are out of this world. Their cocktails are delicious and their desserts are extremely large.  You can tell that the staff at this location are proud of what they do. I received perfectly cooked, tender steak, topped with ample mushrooms and delicious sauce. The mashed potatoes were seasoned perfectly.  I even watched the people next to us send a dish back, and the waitress was so gracious about it. The manager even came over to make sure everything was okay and to get them something new. Bottom line: if you're gonna try this restaurant, this is the location you want to go to. You won't be sorry."
Jason G.,"Pasadena, CA",4426,2425,5439,3.0,11/27/2014,I do enjoy their cheesecake but seldom partake as I can hardly afford the calorie intake.  I used to frequent often for the food but also have found the healthy choices to be limited.  The restaurant is usually crowded and you'll probably have to wait.
Michael P.,"Sacramento, CA",101,4,,2.0,2/26/2016,"Food is ok!!! front desk is terrible!!! I work in restaurant as well and the fact that the front desk person told me that i didnt go and see them once the signal card went off is unacceptable. i thought they were just busy due to dinner time so gave them the doubt of waiting more than 20 mins. but they told me that they put me on hold coz i didnt go see them once the card went off. they didnt even tried looking for us even though we are basically 10 feet away from the front desk. basically waited almost an hour for our table. once i came up to them, they said we are next. but after that still waited 3mins while they are sitting others. and im looking at them and theyre in groups of 4 or more. I love cheesecake factory. but never had this experience like before!"
Rachel M.,"North Highlands, CA",18,31,138,5.0,7/10/2015,"Just had a deliciously prepared meal. My veggie burger is not what I am used to in texture-it was a bit moist and crumbly. My sister's Eggplant Parmesan was great as was my mother's Club Sandwich..The Lemon Meringue Cheesecake is as divine as it looks and the Lo Carb Cheesecake was delicious as well. Our waiter Rafael was WONDERFUL! The last two times I had dined there the waiters were marginal, especially the most previous time.. The guy looked similar to Jax on Vanderpump Rules and was just as arrogant.. Rafael more than made up for it..."
Rob M.,"Sacramento, CA",14,14,,4.0,1/4/2015,"I ate there with a party of 18. It was my first time there and though it was Friday night our wait wasn't as long as you think would be expected for a big party.  The menu was a little overwhelming but they have something for everyone. The food was good and served fast and hot! Our waiter was on point! Wish I could remember his name so I could give him his well deserved props!  My only complaint is more of a question. How come I get mashed potatoes with almost every meal but the fillet mignon comes with French fries? Sure, I could have substituted the fries for mashed potatoes but it would have cost an extra 6 bucks!"
Shawna H.,"Sacramento, CA",497,22,5,4.0,4/22/2016,"Food is great. Sometimes great service,  sometimes so so. The one thing I've  noticed every time I have gone  there is that there always seems to be focus on personal conversations between staff and personally I don't want to hear personal conversations when I'm dining out."
Christy M.,"Sacramento, CA",434,642,69,4.0,10/7/2013,"There's no mystery when you come to a Cheesecake Factory.  You know that you'll get: a good meal, good service, WAY too much food, and probably end up with a slice of cheesecake even though you promised yourself you wouldn't. The menu reads like an epic novel, and it's easy to get overwhelmed.  My strategy is to quickly skim a couple of sections until something catches my eye, and then close the menu and stop reading.  Otherwise, I'd be there all night having a mini panic attack about what I should order.  I usually skip my favorite: the fried mac and cheese balls.  They must come from Heaven, because I literally hear angels sing every time I take a bite.  However, since I'd prefer to prolong my arrival in said afterlife destination, I usually avoid contact with these high fat treats.   However, my will power only goes so far, and I usually end up taking a piece of amazing cheesecake home at the end of the meal.  There's something so exciting about knowing what's waiting for you in the fridge after you put on your pajamas..."
Aron E.,"Tracy, CA",25,9,1,5.0,1/1/2015,"If you're looking for the most interesting (and delicious!) variety of cheesecakes in the valley, come here. If you want to try a host of great food before you skip to dessert, come here. If you're looking for neither, still come here. You will become a believer. As soon as you walk in the door, you'll notice the tidy and inviting atmosphere, as well as the fresh display of almost every cheesecake they have to your left. Once you see those, you know you're coming back. Maybe not tomorrow or next week, as you'll need to recuperate, but face it: you're coming back. The restaurant always looks great. Its colors are relaxing and eye-pleasing, the buidling itself is spacious, and has outdoor and bar seating. The bathroom usually doesn't reek of urine, which is one of the highest forms of compliment I can give to a public restroom. When you sit down to order, they will offer you sweet wheat bread, and either white or sourdough along with butter. And no, you don't get to choose between white and sourdough; I was just too busy stuffing my face with wheat to recall which one it was! The food gets better every time I order. My favorite item on the menu by far is Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp for three words: sweet, spicy Thai. I had to stop myself from ordering it the last few visits so that I could experience a spot of the rest of the huge menu. This is a real item, I kid you not: a burger with topped with fried macaroni and cheese, smothered in more cheese. Need I say that I was scarfing it down during a conversation with abandon? Fish and chips come with huge portions of fish, fries (substitutable for sweet potato), and cole slaw. Everything is huge. For health buffs, you may want the alternate menu, as hardly anything runs under quadruple digits for calories. The cheesecake is served in either large, thick slices for around 7.50 or one of two full cake sizes for special occasions (the larger ones go for 50). Allow me to list off the ones you'll probably want: the large, multi-layered Ultimate Red Velvet, the caramel-covered White Chocolate Macadamia with its sweet cookie-tasting crust, the seasonal flavors, Peppermint and Pumpkin, and the legions of chocolate-based flavors, including Snickers, Reese's, Godiva, mousse, and 30th anniversary cake. That is hardly a third of them. I plan to try them all in years to come. They also have traditional desserts on their menu, which is cute. I may try them someday. The only slight I have against this restaurant is this one server who was visibly and audibly anxious about me ordering several slices of cheesecake to go. It was very rude. Thankfully, I know now to circumvent a rude server by ordering from the counter instead of the table. I'll take my dessert without a side of bullshit, thank you!"
Karen M.,"Roseville, CA",0,23,,5.0,4/19/2016,"Five  Stars for ANTHONY at the Hostess stand  and for the ICED TEA. Cheesecake  Factory among many other Restaurants could use an ANTHONY or 2 for check .ins.  The most on the ball person I have EVER encountered  at check .in. He Should Be The Trainer Of How To Greet guest. And he remembers you. Also, The Iced Tea is Excellent. ."
LyRx J.,"Sacramento, CA",3,49,33,5.0,4/17/2016,"Ok so I love this spot! Happy hour is amazing ! $5 cocktails and apps how could you not be there every chance you get !!!! Fast friendly service , delicious fresh food , huge portions well worth the money whether it's happy hour or not . Our favorite server is mariela I really hope that is her name because she is so amazing !!!! Sweetest thing ever!!!"
Alice R.,"Fairfield, CA",0,1,,1.0,8/20/2016,This is the worse Cheesecake Factory I have visited. There were uncooked quarters of potatoes in the mashed potatoes. The eggplant was not cooked and almost raw. The raspberry lemonade was watered down to almost tasteless. Take the drive and go to Roseville to find a place worthy of the chain.
Carol P.,"Sacramento, CA",3063,824,879,5.0,8/27/2013,"The stars were aligned just right for a fabulous late (11:30pm) Saturday night dinner.  It wasn't crowded at all so we were seated right away.  Our lovely server Ashley had perfect timing whenever she came to our booth to take our order, bring us food, check on us, refill drinks, etc.  Our food came out hot and in record time.   We started off with the calamari ($11), delicately battered and fried crispy, just a tad oily but still had a nice texture without being too chewy.  Cocktail sauce and aioli that accompanied it were good but boring.  Nonetheless, we killed that appetizer!  I decided on the herb crusted salmon and shrimp scampi combo ($20), which comes with mashed potatoes and a few asparagus spears.  Yelpers, I've found my new favorite entree!  The scampi was to die for.  The 3 large shrimps were lightly fried and rested on the most amazingly seasoned garlic and butter sauce, that wasn't too rich but bursting with tons of flavor in every bite.  The mashed red potatoes were thick and creamy and  soaked up the scampi sauce well.  The salmon was topped nicely with an array of fresh chopped herbs and was a good-sized portion.  It was just slightly cooked a little longer than I prefer, but still flaked off nicely and had excellent flavor.  Omega-3 fatty acids at its best!  My bf had the grilled rib eye steak with fries ($25).  It came out with perfect grill marks, and sliced like butter.  It was juicy, tender, and had great flavor.  He found his favorite entree too, and although he thought the size was a little bit small for the price, the flavor made it worth every penny.   The entire meal and dining experience has redeemed The Cheesecake Factory from our previous lackluster visits, and put it back on top as my ""favorite chain restaurant."""
Lily D.,"Roseville, CA",78,451,1209,3.0,1/30/2015,"I have not been to a cheesecake factory since 2009 because my last few experiences did not wow me enough to come back.  Decided to try again as I was in the area on business. We walked in around noon on a thursday.  Place was busy but not packed.  I put my name in, walked away for a Minute, and came back to ask how long the wait would be.  She asked me, ""how many in your party?"" Um, i was just here literally a minute ago and you could not remember you already took my name down? I asked how long and she says, ""not long, we'll call you.""  Not digging the lack of info as I was on a schedule.  Anyways, we were seated within 5 mins along the row where its one long bench seats and one wicker chair across the table so you are seated quited close to people next to you.  Waitress came within a 7 mins to take our order.  We ordered the grilled artichoke appetizer and it was much smaller than expected for $6.99 but good.  The ""helper"" that delivered it first tried giving our artichoke to the table next to us until we got his attention it was ours.   We waited 30 mins for our food to arrive and never saw our waitress during that time.  My friend got the turkey sandwich and salad and I got the lunch portion crusted parmesan chicken.  Both were delicious. However, we again hardly saw our waitress and we had to get going as our lunch hour had passed so we put our credit card out for her to slide to save us time when we finally got the bill.  I looked at the bill and she charged us for drinks when we only had waters which turned out to be the table next us drink order.  Again waited another 10 mins before she ever came back.  Pointed this out and she was gone again for quite some time.  Then had to ask if she voided the original transaction.  She asks, ""did i slide your card?""  so she disapeared AGAIN to fix it.  UGH.  This whole ordeal had us there for 90 mins which should have been only an hour.  I wanted to get dessert but ran out of time.  I give the food a 5 but the service is a 1 so they get an average of 3. Disapointing and made for a very long day as I had to make up my time at work."
Pinhwa S.,"Whisman Station, Mountain View, CA",280,69,346,4.0,4/30/2014,"Great place to celebrate birthdays! If you tell the waiter your celebrating a birthday. All of them comes sings to u and they also write happy birthday on the plate if u order a cheesecake.  Try their Lemon Cello cheese cake! It's really good, me and a friend was able to finish the whole piece just the 2 of us.  Their Mojitos are good too, but kinda too sweet for me.  I had the Hibachi steak. And I asked for rare, it came out just right, exactly how I wanted it. I really liked the wasabi mash-potato, and how the sliced the steak like sashimi.  All the times I came to Cheesecake Factory I'm never disappointed by the food of service. :)"

Lily D.,"Roseville, United States",78,451,1209,3.0,30/1/2015,"I have not been to a cheesecake factory since 2009 because my last few experiences did not wow me enough to come back.  Decided to try again as I was in the area on business. We walked in around noon on a thursday.  Place was busy but not packed.  I put my name in, walked away for a Minute, and came back to ask how long the wait would be.  She asked me, ""how many in your party?"" Um, i was just here literally a minute ago and you could not remember you already took my name down? I asked how long and she says, ""not long, we'll call you.""  Not digging the lack of info as I was on a schedule.  Anyways, we were seated within 5 mins along the row where its one long bench seats and one wicker chair across the table so you are seated quited close to people next to you.  Waitress came within a 7 mins to take our order.  We ordered the grilled artichoke appetizer and it was much smaller than expected for $6.99 but good.  The ""helper"" that delivered it first tried giving our artichoke to the table next to us until we got his attention it was ours.   We waited 30 mins for our food to arrive and never saw our waitress during that time.  My friend got the turkey sandwich and salad and I got the lunch portion crusted parmesan chicken.  Both were delicious. However, we again hardly saw our waitress and we had to get going as our lunch hour had passed so we put our credit card out for her to slide to save us time when we finally got the bill.  I looked at the bill and she charged us for drinks when we only had waters which turned out to be the table next us drink order.  Again waited another 10 mins before she ever came back.  Pointed this out and she was gone again for quite some time.  Then had to ask if she voided the original transaction.  She asks, ""did i slide your card?""  so she disapeared AGAIN to fix it.  UGH.  This whole ordeal had us there for 90 mins which should have been only an hour.  I wanted to get dessert but ran out of time.  I give the food a 5 but the service is a 1 so they get an average of 3. Disapointing and made for a very long day as I had to make up my time at work."

All of them comes sings to u and they also write happy birthday on the plate if u order a cheesecake.  Try their Lemon Cello cheese cake! It's really good, me and a friend was able to finish the whole piece just the 2 of us.  Their Mojitos are good too, but kinda too sweet for me.  I had the Hibachi steak. And I asked for rare, it came out just right, exactly how I wanted it. I really liked the wasabi mash-potato, and how the sliced the steak like sashimi.  All the times I came to Cheesecake Factory I'm never disappointed by the food of service. :)"
