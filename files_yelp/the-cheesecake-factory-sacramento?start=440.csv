Mariah R.,"Sacramento, CA",42,364,193,2.0,3/7/2015,Hair in my cheesecake! But the manager made up for it
Shyelle S.,"Sacramento, CA",137,11,,5.0,4/12/2016,Luis is an excellent waiter! He is very attentive and patient. He took amazing care of us!! Thank you so much Luis!
Myke Y.,"San Francisco, CA",546,147,10357,4.0,12/3/2013,"Ahhh The Cheesecake Factory, widely known for its humungous portions of proteins, fowl, and seafood.  However, on this particular mission, I did not partake in any such delectable food adventures, as I had a liquid dinner, mainly consisting of, or course whiskey.  The mission was specific, it was specifically planned, like ripping a band-aid off, it was overly due, and yes, the force was with me. And now that it's in the rear view, never to be an issue again, a huge weight has been lifted off my shoulders, I've cleared my mind, my soul, and have never been more focused and happy moving on.  Ok, let's talk about the drinks!  San Pellagrino water to start while the bartender concocted my Macallan 12 on the rocks (shame most establishments don't stock on 18/25+, but I understand... $$$).  I usually have it neat but it was already warm there in a packed bar/house.  And so as the condensation wrapped around my ice cold glass, I took a whiff of that sweet, oak, sherry filled aroma only my whiskey can give me.  And once it hit my lips, the sweet burn from the aged single-malt, to the smooth finish rolling from my tongue down my throat, coating it with the finest blend of alcohol known to man... in that moment, in that warm feeling, I knew it was going to be just fine the rest of the night.  And so were the next three rounds.   Alas, feeling warm, comfortable, and now satisfied from completing my mission, ""Mission unfinished business"", I left satisfied, content, and ready to a little tipsy, hehe.  It was the perfect setting to close out that chapter of my life, and as I walked out the doors to see the glowing lights of The Cheesecake Factory, I also walked into a new life full of happiness and mental focus that no one can break.  Thanks again for a splendid time TCF, was very happy to be back in the 916. I was right at home here!"
Kirsten R.,"Elk Grove, CA",88,45,82,4.0,4/20/2014,"I actually like Cheesecake Factory. There's so many options so it's great for a party of picky or indecisive eaters. You can get a little bit of everything that anyone could be craving. Usually always busy when I go there.. But the wait has never been too crazy.  My friend is obsessed with the Steak Dianne. It's the only consistent thing that he has always ordered here.  So I will try to remember everything that I have ordered there. I've had their calamari and shrimp summer rolls. The calamari is ok.. Nothing too special. The rolls are good, it comes with 3 rolls and I got pretty full with just that. I didn't like the kale salad. The cheesecakes are always so good. I've been wanting to try the pumpkin cheesecake .. I'm always out of season :( in a couple months then .. Haha."
Jeanice S.,"Sacramento, CA",269,271,424,1.0,9/28/2013,"The girl at the front desk basically acted as though we forgot to check in after the pager buzzes. Well, the pager didn't buzz!! So either she messed up or she gave us a broken pager. She didn't even apologize. We were told it was a 20 minute wait for two people and so we waited about 40 minutes just to be nice. So we finally went to the front. She just said ""oh we've been buzzing you."" I would not have known if the buzz was not working correctly. She then handed us another pager and logged it in. Really?! And that new pager went off in less than a minute. Like did you really have to give us another pager? And she told me and my bf to stand on the side near the bar so we could get seated. The only thing that bothered me is that she didn't apologize. Very disappointing."
Thao V.,"Arden-Arcade, Sacramento, CA",49,10,7,4.0,5/21/2015,"Took my sister here to celebrate her first day of college. The atmosphere is nice and cozy, and the waiters/waitress were friendly and always on top of things. Like other yelpers mentioned, the prices are about $20 a plate--but the servings are HUGE and I haven't come across a dish I didn't like. My sister really wanted to try some cheesecake, but we were so stuffed, we decided to try it on another date. (But ooooohhh, they look SO good!) Until next time!"
Paola M.,"Sacramento, CA",9,30,16,4.0,4/4/2015,"I'm the type of person who gets the same thing once I find what I enjoy. Let me tell you, get the Louisiana Chicken Pasta. WOW !! This is my favorite pasta dish EVER. I will only come here for the pasta. Alot of other dishes I've tried are just meh, besides the Kobe Burger. Red Velvet Cheesecake is good, but not the best. Service has always been good so far. Will always come back as long as they serve that pasta dish lol."
Amber C.,"Sacramento, CA",22,3,,2.0,10/30/2016,"I called for a take out order 3 times, waited on hold for 10 minutes each time. Hire more people in take out. If i ask how busy you are Chelsea, then let me know both for dine in and take out, and don't have an attitude. I won't eat where I feel like people are unhappy that work there. I still love the food, It will just be at another location."
Fabian T.,"San Francisco, CA",198,10,1,1.0,9/29/2014,"So the drinks are brought out to us and we realize there some sort of gunk on the outside of the cups. Then I find a big white glob on the inside of my soda. So we look at the silver wear how disgusting! We ask for a manager and as we are telling him this, he seems so nonchalant about everything we are informing him about he asks if we want him to change the dirty things out for clean ones. We say no we can not eat here after such a bad experience and he says awesome walks over to a waiter and he must have said something about the situation because she starts laughing at looking at us. As we proceed to walk out we reach the door when we hear the hostess yell in a sarcastic tone  ""bye thank you and have a wonderful day,"" such a terrible experience."
Sandy K.,"Whittier, CA",3003,1575,9402,4.0,3/16/2012,OK I'm a fan of Cheesecake Factory and Grand Lux due to their consistent quality of food and above par service. After driving around to several downtown Sacramento Restaurants and wasting money on parking I ended up at The Cheesecake Factory which was minutes from my hotel.   I was still recovering from a large lunch so I went with the Chicken and Shrimp gumbo. The portion was large and the shrimp and chicken were tasty and so tender. The sauce mixed with the steam rice was so yummy. I love southern style cooking and Cheesecake fixed my Cajun craving.
Koner M.,"El Dorado Hills, CA",0,4,,5.0,4/6/2016,"To be honest this place never disappoints. He service is excellent, and having a delicious menu makes this place great. I had the chicken Madeira; cooked to perfection. Recommend this place. Yes!"
Erin W.,"Davis, CA",217,248,,2.0,11/12/2015,spicy cashew chicken that was too sweet and they removed the tuna ahi macadamia crusted steak
Starr C.,"Rio Linda, CA",44,15,24,5.0,3/6/2016,"One of my fav's. Great menu selection. They now have GF options, even a GF cheesecake. So save room for the Godiva Choc cheesecake."
Malika H.,"Oakland, CA",240,116,99,4.0,10/23/2014,"Great place for a date! The lighting could be just a smidge brighter, as they are quite dim in the evenings.  The crab bites were quite delectable, along with the sauce. They come in the form of six small round, fried balls of crab. For some reason I was not expecting them to be fried, but they were still pretty tasty, regardless. Shared an entree of the luau salad and the garlic noodles with shrimp. The luau salad was awesome! A little on the sweet side for a salad, but I enjoyed the different vegetables and the bits of mango and the crunchy sesame cracker. The presentation was quite divine as well! The noodles were good but not great; they were more on the oily side. I did enjoy the accompaniment of the sundried tomatoes and mushrooms mixed in. Our waitress seemed to be in a bit of a rush, but not a big deal as I did not feel overly pressured to order. For dessert we had the pumpkin cheesecake, as I am a huge pumpkin fan. I will be back but not for some, as the menu is very much for a night of indulgence!"
Nicole L.,"Sacramento, CA",159,289,87,4.0,5/15/2013,"Fresh strawberry martinis are on the menu! I have a love/hate relationship with the Cheesecake Factory. Like most of us.  It's located in the Arden Mall, which I don't hold against them.  Portions: typical, huge, American-sized over the top. But... they include the calorie count. Thank you, Cheesecake Factory, for being responsible! I love the Thai Lettuce Wraps- more than enough for two people, but hey, also enough for one without guilt.  The drinks are fantastic. The strawberry martinis are out of this world. If you need comfort food, I highly recommend this place. Unfortunately, you get a lot of people who like to act pretentious, which I'm sure the staff don't appreciate either- and by the way, staff have ALWAYS been courteous here.  Of course I'd come back here.  You can valet park. Or park on the next row by yourself. Depends on how much flash you have on display that night."
Andrew S.,"West Hollywood, CA",3715,733,1722,4.0,12/1/2014,"Love the bread! Ive never been disappointed on any of my visits to this location. Been here over dozen times. Depends on my mood. Days when I don't care about calories I will definitely go for the chicken littles or one of the burgers with fries. The lunch sandwich, soup and salad is a great deal for the price."
Ruben J.,"San Francisco, CA",2,29,26,3.0,4/23/2015,"Really didnt have a great first time here with my girlfriend. I had high expectations for this place because ive always heard people rave about it and i thought myself, why not give it a try? Thats what i did and the food came out so bland that i over heard a couple 2 tables from us who ordered the same thing ask for a recall and a request to order another. I had ordered the same thing the guy at the other table asked for and that came out much better. I am not sure if theyre big on consistency but they should be or else they'll be wasting tons of money on food recalls. Hopefully next time is a better visit."
Devo S.,"Sacramento, CA",970,1012,3135,4.0,5/30/2011,"Great birthday lunch there yesterday!   Hadn't been in a while, so chose this place.   I forgot how extensive the menu is, and had a difficult time narrowing down my selection, but ended up with the chicken and biscuits...DELISH!  I also forgot how HUGE the portions are, so needless to say I had plenty leftovers to take home, since I HAD to leave room for a slice of cheesecake.  Normally, I'm all about chocolate and/or peanut butter, but today I fixated on the fresh banana cream cheesecake, and it was FANTASTIC!   The mother-in-law loved her garlic noodles; hubby loved his lettuce wraps, father-in-law liked almost all of his salmon w/brown rice (sauce was a tad too sweet).  Refills were kept up well, and thankfully I did NOT get sung to for my birthday.   I forgot how much I enjoyed this place, and will endeavor to return.  I encourage others to eat here; you're bound to find SOMETHING you'll like. :)"
Lee D.,"Sacramento, CA",7,71,899,4.0,3/10/2016,The only thing I've always order here is the Chinese chicken salad an the seasonal cheesecake. The salad dressing is this plum sauce that they make either daily or weekly. You have the option of purchasing their dressing an make your own salad at home. It's more of a romantic setting if you choose to dine there.
jeff s.,"Sacramento, CA",3,27,1,5.0,4/27/2016,"guuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuurrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr­rlllllllllll this muthafuckin cheesecake factory is the shit!! i got the bacon bacon cheeseburger 3x now and every time its better! the only bad thing is the fukking calories you consume at this place are massive so i dont come often cuz i stay fit, nawmsayn?"
