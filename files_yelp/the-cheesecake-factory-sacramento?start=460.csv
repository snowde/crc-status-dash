Roberta C.,"Sacramento, CA",52,17,1,5.0,12/4/2014,The chicken madera is so good..I get it every time I go..plus the tropical martini adds the final touch to a wonderful dinner
Katlyn P.,"Yuba City, CA",21,18,8,5.0,3/13/2014,"I love this restaurant, it nice to go to a nice place, and enjoy a meal. We were seated promptly, and our waitress took our drink order and was back in under 2 min. She was very efficient and had no wasted movements.  Onto the food, I ordered the spicy cashew chicken and was it ever wonderful! It was a work of art, just enough chicken to cashew to rice to sauce, and the serving size was enough to feed 2 people.  That being said, it is kinda pricey to eat there. I would recommend this place as a date night kind of place. Maybe a movie afterwards."
Tim C.,"Gardnerville, NV",64,4,,5.0,11/6/2015,"After a long day getting our space setup at the International Motorcycle Show at Cal Expo in Sacramento, all I wanted was a nice pizza & cocktail before going to bed early. After a quick search I found a California Pizza Kitchen nearby. I was my usual ""unexcited"" about going to a chain restaurant but wth.  The restaurant was packed but we were seated in 5 minutes... Good start. A quick glance at the menu and I ordered the roasted Halibut. Our lovely waitress, Adrien, brought out sliced warm bread with a well made chimichurri sauce. Unusual but I love chimichurri, so bonus! The fish entrée came soon after and oh my was I surprised at how well designed and execution of the plate. Every bite was perfect from the halibut, roasted asparagus, butternut squash, farro to and baby kale. My attitude has greatly improved about CPK and I will definitely return for more great food with awesome service, thanks Adrien, you were great!"
Tim N.,"Sacramento, CA",232,13,,5.0,6/25/2016,"My friends and I arrived at The Cheesecake Factory on a busy Saturday evening around 5:30. Because Arden Fair is pretty busy on weekend evenings, it first took a while to find parking (I ended up parking in front of the UA entrance). After I walked over to the restaurant, I discovered that it would take nearly two hours before a table would be ready. Because we had a party of 15, I'm assuming that wait time is ""fairly reasonable"" - in the mean time, some of us visited Arden while the others remained to look over the menu. After our table was furnished, we were greeted by a friendly server and were served bread and drinks. The server was extremely professional in demeanor and illuminated our experience with small-talk. Some of my friends ordered sole cheesecake, while others ordered pasta and I ordered the Steak Diane - with such an array of menu options, the worst part of our experience was deciding which plate to order. After consuming the provided bread, our entrees were delivered in a timely manner. My stead was cooked well, but the entire dish was sitting in a pool of steak sauce, which was somewhat overwhelming. As we ate our meals, our waiter checked in periodically to ensure that everything was going smoothly and even bagged our plates to-go at the end of the meal. Overall, the experience is definitely worth the price - with the whole ""a little extra goes a long way"" mentality - and it is safe to say that I will be returning shortly."
Alex B.,"Elk Grove, CA",17,92,159,4.0,10/12/2015,There menu is big enough that anyone can find something to eat. Service tends to be slow sometimes but it be do to the size of the place or the staff having to tend many tables at once. If your to full after your meal take a cheesecake to go.
Kory R.,"Fairfield, CA",318,343,1005,3.0,1/18/2014,"8 of us from work decided to have lunch. We made a reservation since there were so many of us. Once we got there, we were seated promptly. Our waiter was very friendly and attentive. The table was a bit sticky from their wipe down but honestly we didn't have time to ask them to do it again. We all ordered and then the waiting game began. It felt like forever before the food came out but once it did we were all happy with our salads, pastas, tacos,etc.  I was surprised how big my BBQ Chicken Salad lunch portion was and of course I loved my passion fruit iced tea.. The waiter was prompt on getting us out (so we could get back to work in time) which was really appreciated. To sum it up, it was a typical Cheesecake Factory with good food and great service!!"
Kim P.,"Kula, HI",1,9,16,1.0,7/27/2015,"Poor service from the hosting staff. Waiter didn't listen to us. And the freaking menu had ADS in it!?!? SERIOUSLY? I can't even flip through a menu while out to eat on vacation without being blasted with ads. Completely ridiculous. When they brought my food nobody said the plate was scalding, so i got burned pretty bad. On top of that my food was so overcooked it was not edible and i sent it back.Will NOT be eating here again."
Nyome C.,"Rio Linda, CA",50,20,6,1.0,2/25/2016,"Very very disturbing experience.. Long wait for drinks appetizer was okay calamari. Waited about 45 minutes for dinner entrees which consisted of hard rice and orange chicken that should have been on the menu at sizzler definitely won't be returning one hell of a birthday dinner!!! I won't recommend!"" Personally the food was not all that good the service was not all that good I will not be coming back""! Words from my fiance.."
Amber A.,"Sacramento, CA",0,2,,5.0,4/1/2016,"Me and my wife come here at least 3 times a month, I do have to say at first I was scared to eat this restaurant, but here I am almost 6mos later and very happy with the services & food the clean atmosphere. I have to say Jennifer the manager and help of the kitchen and most important server make sure my food is right when ever I go love it here, they make me feel like I am a guest  but I do have too say today service was outstanding BRETT I want to say THANK YOU for your OUTSTANDING service today . So all I am trying to say is if want great food service and  outstanding restaurant service visit the Cheesecake Factory on Arden.  JENNIFER you run a great crew and a clean restaurant and I will be happy to say I will keep coming back. THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR HARD WORK AND GREAT GUEST SERVICE."
S G.,"Sacramento, CA",1,31,23,1.0,10/1/2016,We ordered at 12:40. It is now 1:25 and our meals have still not arrived. Our food finally arrived at 1:30. At least the order was correct. It's sad when the kitchen gets backed up.
Debbie P.,"Sacramento, CA",34,23,,2.0,9/11/2016,We've had better breakfast/brunch at Mel's Diner. The tomatoes were flavorless at the peak so summer picking. Mediocre sides and over priced. Stingy on jam.
Patrick K.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,7,,1.0,10/11/2014,"Pay for valet - fine restaurants don't charge you to park and dine at their establishment. No reservations - long wait for a table - Again, a fine restaurants takes reservations and does not mar it's diners wait in a crowded hallway. You can receive better treatment for less money at any restaurant downtown with free valet."
Mar R.,"Redondo Beach, CA",0,88,,5.0,1/29/2016,"Just had the best experience ever!!!  The reason is because of the best waiter ever, Rob.  This guy is not only very professional and attentive but he is beyond knowledgeable about what's in the food.  As a vegetarian, you want to avoid having animal products in your food and he blew us away.  He told us how things were prepared and what items were truly vegetarian.  My glass was never empty, the table was cleared right away and he made us feel at home.  Not one to compliment someone for doing their job, but he went above and beyond and then some."
Anastasia G.,"Woodland, CA",2,7,4,5.0,4/6/2015,This place is amazing. The service was just amazing! All the servers are so sweet. I walked in just about every said hello. As I walked out everyone said goodbye and have a great day. The atmosphere is nice. The food was great. Didn't wait too long. Overall just great service
Marla D.,"Redding, CA",0,31,1,4.0,4/4/2015,"I've had the lemon herb chicken from numerous cheesecake factory locations in California and it has been mediocre. I was at this location last week and had the best lemon herb chicken ever. The sauce was great, well seasoned, carrots were perfection, and the watercress was the perfect compliment. The sweet wheat bread is delicious.  The cheesecake slices seem to be very small for the price! Everything is a bit overpriced. Food took a while to come but worth the wait."
Priscilla R.,"Oakley, CA",0,2,,5.0,3/9/2016,"Came her about a month ago with the family. My waiter was hilarious, and very honest. I went to order something and he wasn't shy about telling me that it was terrible and I should try something else. I told him what kind of meal I was looking for, and he recommended one of their chicken plates that was DELICIOUS. I ordered the peanut butter cheesecake to go, and it was seriously the best thing ever. A day after this visit, I realized I had left my son's favorite hat at the table. My mom gave them a call (I believe Grace helped her) asking if they had found it, and luckily they did. She sent them a Fed Ex label, and they went out of their way to drop the package off to get sent to us. That was above and beyond, and just the icing on the cake for a wonderful visit. Thank you Cheesecake Factory!"
G A.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",15,21,91,4.0,5/3/2015,I could never get tired of this place. I love how they bring bread and butter right away that way if your really hungry you have something to eat until the food comes. Also the appetizers and the food is great too so much to choose from. The down side for me is that every time I'm here I get full and I have not tried their cheese cake yet:(
Yvette N.,"Sacramento, CA",1,7,13,5.0,3/25/2015,They never disappoint.. the cheesecake is delicious...... I lovee you Guys.. plus the food Always fantastic.  Good service ! Its always pack when I go but they Get you a table as fast as they can .. once again the cheesecake is my favorite. ..!!!!!!!
Thor F.,"Sacramento, CA",0,2,2,4.0,6/3/2015,"I ordered a pesto style chicken pizza which was delicious (I am sorry that I do not remember the exact item name). The portions and food were good, the only item of discrepancy I had with the place had more to do with price. I understand prestige branding and quality ingredients, what I do not understand is when your burger items start at $12.00 and other places that specialize in burgers such as Red Robins begin their menu items at a more reasonable price. Other then that I would advise those who do not want to wait to make reservations."
