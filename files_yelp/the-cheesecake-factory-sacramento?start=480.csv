Lyn C.,"Fairfield, CA",2,26,6,4.0,11/15/2014,"Found some wax paper in my cheesecake. (I ordered the Godiva one) I usually love this place and their servers are always super nice but this turned me off. Despite the wax paper it's a good place to go to. I'm not one to bash a place based off one bad experience, so that's why I only took one star off."
Michael C.,"Sacramento, CA",40,11,,2.0,11/18/2015,Don't order mexican food anywhere other than a mexican restaurant. Not sure how many times I need to learn that lesson.  This was my first time to the cheesecake factory. I ordered their burrito which sounded good. I had high hopes this would be a better experience since there is so much hype around this business.  The red sauce tastes more like spaghetti sauce it was tolerable. But what really was upsetting was the rice. It was undercooked which is something I can't stand. I asked that they remake it and I think they just used the same batch of rice cause the second one came out and it was also undercooked. At this point I was too polite to bring it up. I was under the impression that the burrito was comped at this point but instead they removed it from my receipt and then added it again to the receipt. I think they somehow hoped I would see the removal and not see that they added it again. I thought that seemed kinda weird. I asked them why it wasn't comped and she said the manager brought a salad to hold me over and that would somehow make it right. She said she would go to her manager and see if the cheesecake could be comped. So in the end my burrito ended up being 50 % off but was still unsatisfactory cause undercooked rice is just gross.  Here is the good. The cheesecake was delicious but super rich. I am fine with that. I just eat a little at a time and put it back in the fridge. The Reeses cheesecake was delicious. My husband ordered a burger and thoroughly enjoyed it.  I will be back for cheesecake but I really think they should treat the customer with a little more respect and quality check their ingredients. I can't say this enough undercooked rice is gross. You wouldn't give a customer undercooked meat so why would you give them undercooked rice. Twice!
Monica M.,"San Francisco, CA",232,105,309,1.0,9/2/2014,"I've been coming to Cheesecake Factory as long as I can remember . we come here couple times a month and I must say I think it's the come to an end with them. First off let me tell you my recent experience. We ordered the Chinese chicken salad and the buffalo blast for lunch . We spilt the salad up so we both can share their huge salad and we didn't notice until we ate some that their where two huge pieces of brown paper towel pieces In it and we both look bites of it . Super gross and disgusting !  We told the waiter and they both just looked at us and said we will get a manager over . He didn't come until like 15 minutes later ! We already lost out appetites and where grossed out . He apologized and took it off the bill but it want sincere . If he ate paper towel pieces in his food,  from his favorite restaurant he would be pissed off too ! Sorry to say but I think that's the last time I will visit ! You've lost a loyal customer !"
Carla C.,"Oakland, CA",108,600,216,4.0,7/21/2014,"Three plus baby for Sunday brunch.  The mojito is delightful, even if they keep the price a secret. $11!  My lunch size shepherd's pie was tasty and just salty-savory enough. My companion ordered from the gluten-free menu. Said the bun was no bueno. I told her to just order a no carb burger. Maybe next time.  I just like the low-key vibe here, which, along with the large menu variety,  makes this an easy choice for a family."
Jazzmin C.,"Hayward, CA",88,22,2,2.0,12/26/2015,"Sadly, the 2 stars is for the food, the only saving grace. Hostesses we're rude and could definitely use extra training. Regardless of how crowded the place is or frazzled you may feel, you're the first point of contact, don't mess it up! Oh wait you already did. Thanks for the turn off and desire to never return to this place again."
Jerry B.,"Elk Grove, CA",4,37,180,4.0,2/24/2015,"We always come here for dinner.  My dinner fav is the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp.  But this is my first time coming here for brunch...I had their French toast... This is what their menu says... ""BRULÉED FRENCH TOAST... The ""Best"" French Toast Ever! Our Extra Thick Slices of Rustic French Bread Baked and Grilled Golden Brown. Topped with Powdered Sugar""... I really like their french toast but I still rate it second behind Tower Cafe's French Toast...           My better half had the farm house omelette.  She was not satisfied, and will not get any omelettes here again.  Also, she and my brother ordered omelettes and asked to have sliced tomatoes, but instead got potatoes.  I wonder why everytime we come here, my wife's order gets messed up somehow. She got comped her meal, on two separate occasions.  On another day, she's got comped a slice of cheesecake for their mistake.  It makes me sad because, everything is on point at this restaurant.  From the friendly staff, service, menu selection, delicious food (except the omelette), cleanliness and atmosphere... but why can't they get the order right... ???... Its the norm everytime we come here... Till next time CCF"
Lisa L.,"San Francisco, CA",384,153,457,5.0,2/21/2013,"We all can agree this place is pricey but so good. I don't think I've experienced any bad service from here so I'll just I've you the low down of some things to try.  For the ladies that are 21+, try the Georgia peach cocktail. It's fruity, icee, slightly strong and HUGE! It's my favorite drink here. If you come on an empty stomach, you're going be buzzing by the end of the meal.  I'm not that big fan of chocolate, so my go to cheesecake is the dulce de leche caramel. Light flavors and sweet. I don't feel as guilty if I were to get the Godiva chocolate cheesecake. There's parking valet apparently, but I'm not too sure why'd you valet in Sacramento. There's 3 spots for ""to go"" right by the entrance."
JoAnna E.,"Citrus Heights, CA",0,19,15,2.0,8/27/2015,"Went to lunch with my husband and our daughter yesterday. Service was great but why seat us in the bar?? No one wants to sit in a bar and have lunch with a kid sitting next to you, at least I don't. That's why we sit In the bar areas, to take a break. The entire time we ate, we continued getting glances by prospective bar sitters on their way in.  Our daughter is well behaved, but your restaurants are huge, could have found us a better seat. Anyhow, we had a veggie burger and regular burger for lunch. Blah.. Boring and the lettuce that came with the veggie burger was slimy.. Yes slimy. Old old old lettuce.  We won't be coming back. The lack of attention to what's going out of the kitchen is a turn off and leaves you wondering what they do catch before it leaves?!"
CeeRod E.,"Stockton, CA",1,13,1,5.0,2/16/2016,First time here on Valentines day the wait was pretty long but we got seated maybe 15 mins after arrival outside which i think was a good choice being a busy day the outside section was calm and we enjoyed it a lot the food was DELICIOUS i say this because right now im pregnant and im really picky with all the food but my husbands plate and mine where great! But also waited for our dinner almost 30 mins other than that its a great place ! really looking forward to go again
Skye L.,"Sacramento, CA",100,12,6,5.0,1/30/2016,"I went on a date there last night with my wife and the service was amazing! I have been to this restaurant many times but this was my wife's first time there. It was very busy but the host told us 35 minutes and in 35 minute exactly, we were seated! Our waiter,Jared D.,  came over to our table right away. He was very nice and personable! I had a small issue with my food which was not Jared's fault at all but he fixed it right away! The night manager, Diana, came to our table and was very accommodating! We will definitely be going back here again. We Loved the food and service. Jared d. Is an amazing waiter and if you can, sit in his section! The service here is the best!"
Kiara J.,"Elk Grove, CA",7,4,1,5.0,1/27/2016,The food was amazing. The wine was fantastic. It was my fathers birthday and they happened to mess up my mothers order and the manager Diana came over and was so kind about the mix up. She wasn't rude or disrespectful and she gave a generous discount that instantly made my mother happy about her overall experience. This place is highly suggested and the nicest manager I have met of all the places I have eaten out at.
Dipu D.,"San Mateo, CA",0,16,,5.0,2/13/2016,"Cheesecake factory never fails  you. They have a huge menu. Be there few times, figure out what you like best. Order your favorites over and over."
Louis H.,"Sacramento, CA",0,4,1,5.0,4/25/2015,"After long day working my girlfriend took me out for dinner. I was hungry and tired, so she decide to have a drink and then decided to eat at the bar. We had a very good waiter. He was quick and  attentive to our needs. I want thank  the cooks for such a good flavor dinner and very enjoyable meal. Thanks agaian"
Nico I.,"Sacramento, CA",6,53,1,4.0,1/9/2016,"I got to give a huge thank you to the manager Todd, the dinner was very good, the staff was also helpful"
Leonard J.,"Sacramento, CA",1,23,2,1.0,5/27/2016,what a bunch of uncoordinated monkeys. got sat down before several other tables in some cramped stupid bench area. got the bread brought out to us. cool bread. yay bread. then we waited twenty minutes or longer and didn't even get someone by to ask us if we wanted drinks not even the human required water. they continued to torture our dehydrated mouths from the bread they laid out earlier. we were so thirsty  but we continued to eat super dry bread in hopes it would provide some nourishment we hoped for upon entering the establishment. meanwhile all the other tables proceeded to highly enjoy their adult beverages. we got up and left and contemplated flipping the table first.
Kathy M.,"Loomis, CA",0,67,,5.0,8/25/2016,"The food, menu selection and service is excellent! The staff is very attentive and the waiters are all very friendly and helpful. Great food and ambiance at this particular location. I can't comment on other locations as I have only been to the one on Arden Way."
Kelly L.,"Elk Grove, CA",102,25,234,4.0,5/22/2013,"Belly-Satisfying food found here! Had Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta, Garlic Noodles with Chicken, Corn Dog Kids Meal & red velvet cheesecake for dinner.  Service is consistently fabulous! When wait times are long, i Suggest waiting at the bar & enjoying their fruity mixed drinks-haven't came across any that I didn't enjoy."
D C.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,12,,1.0,8/3/2016,"Very loud and noisy. We put in our order then we continued to wait for 30 minutes for an order of 2 plates. The waitress not once came by to fill our waters and not once came by to explain the delay. The manager finally came by to explain the delay and when the waitress finally came back with our food, she asked if we wanted to order anything else. Um... No."
Raven J.,"Sacramento, CA",58,52,69,4.0,6/14/2014,"I love the Cheesecake Factory. Despite it being unhealthy and the drinks are super expensive, it still is a great place to eat. When you arrive they don't do pagers anymore for when you wait for a table. Instead they text you, which is great if it is a really long wait you can go to the mall. The buffalo blasts are delicious"
Vanessa L.,"Stockton, CA",437,8,1,4.0,11/29/2015,Went here last night for dinner and had a great experience. Even with a packed house we waited less than 10 minutes for our seats. The server was personable and friendly. We ordered our food and got our drinks and appetizers but the main course was taking awhile. Before we had to ask what was taking so long the server was on it and brought us complimentary soup to hold us off until the meal came. The food and cocktails were made very well. I will be returning again!
