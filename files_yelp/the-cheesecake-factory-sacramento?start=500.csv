Brandon L.,"Elk Grove, CA",65,389,373,4.0,6/15/2015,"I always enjoyed the food selection at The Cheesecake Factory. They serve burgers, pasta, pizza, tacos, breakfast items, and other delicious types of food.  Don't forget of course the cheesecake. Of the times I have been at this location service and food was good. Line can be long at time especially on a weekend so wait times might be high. They offer valet parking for a small price near the entrance of the restaurant or you can just park your own car near by. They have lots of seating inside and some seating outside. A full bar is there with tvs for you to view. If you are looking for a section of food, The Cheesecake Factory is a great place for it."
Cindy K.,"Folsom, CA",208,1066,517,3.0,9/27/2010,"I wanted to have my birthday party here last weekend. I called 2 weeks in advance to make reservations. They did NOT allow me to make a reservation for the weekend. What is that all about?! My party and I ended up having to wait almost and hour for a table. Ridiculous!  FYI: if you bring a cake they will charge PER PERSON for using the silverware and plates to serve the cake.  Now the food was good, which is why I chose this place for my birthday. I love Cheesecake Factor food. Yum yum! But I had a very upsetting visit for my birthday. They don't even give you a free cheesecake for you birthday. Only a small sundae."
Due V.,"Santa Cruz, CA",0,13,1,4.0,3/18/2015,Really like this place and would definitely be back.  Pro:  Beef patty for their burger has a phenomenal  texture. Taste is so-so.  The chicken in the Chicken Madeira was cooked PERFECTLY. Sadly the sauce tasted a bit like soy sauce. Presentation of the dish was great and professional.  Loved their blueberry cheesecake with white chocolate shaving!! First bite and I was in heaven. Their mango and apple pie cheesecake were also good. However their cheesecake in general is sweeter compared to Safeway cheesecake.  Con: ... Theres always a line for cheesecake.. The taste of their food has yet to surprise me for the most part. Need to try more dishes.
Kristin A.,"Sacramento, CA",35,15,4,5.0,7/31/2014,"I've been here quite a few times and while I have never been disappointed, yesterday's service just blew me away. My boyfriend and I came here last night to celebrate our 1 year anniversary. Much to our surprise we arrived to find it was National Cheesecake Day (1/2 price cheesecake for dine-in customers).  When I walked in, there was a line of at least 15-20 people ahead of me simply waiting to put their names on the list to be seated. I considered leaving just by seeing the line but decided to wait it out. When I got to the front, I was happily greeted by the hostess. Her mood was extremely cheery and bubbly despite all the chaos and the hectic work shift I'm sure she was having. She told me the wait time would be about 20-25 minutes and took my phone number so she could shoot me a text when my table was ready. How cool is that?! If there's a long wait, you can easily head over to Arden for a while and do some shopping and then just head back a few minutes before your estimated wait time is up without having to worry you'll deactivate the usual buzzers restaurants give you. Anyways, the wait was about 25 minutes as she said, not too bad for such a busy day. Very soon after we were seated, a worker brought us bread and then shortly after that we were greeted by our waiter. BIG shoutout to our waiter, Luis L, for being absolutely amazing. He kept my drink refilled at all times despite my immense thirst and my quick emptying of my glass, he was very friendly and always checked in on us to ensure we were doing well. I ordered the Chicken Madeira and my boyfriend ordered the California Cheesesteak. Both of us were extremely satisfied with our meals; taste, temperature and serving size were all on point. One of the best parts of the whole night  was being able to get two slices of cheesecake for the price of one (thanks National Cheesecake Day!) Cheesecakes were delicious and our waiter let us take them to go because we were too full to eat them there haha. Nice job to all the workers that day. You guys were hauling...and it showed! I'll definitely be back in the near future :)"
Lisa V.,"Sacramento, CA",33,182,398,4.0,9/9/2014,"every time i come here i always leave satisfied. the pasta di vinci is good. last time the server shredded cheese on it, a big chunk fell off the block. i said to leave it there i love extra cheese lol."
Keith H.,"Plumas Lake, CA",39,88,21,2.0,10/4/2014,"2 stars is the food rating, not the service rating. The fresh spring rolls were not fresh, the edges were dried up. Anyone that knows what fresh spring rolls are, will agree that these were pre made and sitting idle. I also order the salmon and steak combo. The steak was not tender at all and the salmon was not good at all. The servers were all nice though, they don't count on this review. I also have to mention that one member in our group had to wait for his food because it was missed. This place probably has it's ups and downs. Today was one of the downs."
Jenneye V.,"Sacramento, CA",89,29,43,4.0,10/19/2014,"I haven't came here in over 3 years, but it was pretty much the exact feeling as 3 years ago.  I was at a party of 16 with no reservations, but got sat down pretty quick. We weren't able to get seated indoors (at least we weren't going to wait two hours), but we got say outdoors with heating lamps in just 15 minutes. Nice! I ordered the burrito, and it was pretty yummy. The plate was pretty hot, but the food wasn't. I'm not sure why that was though. Our waiter was very nice and attentive. He made sure we were well topped off with water, and took care of our every need.  We were pretty loud, so I'm kind of glad we were sat outdoors. (Oopsies for our neighbors!) The pastas were okay.  Food: 3.5 stars Service: 4 stars"
Shelley S.,"Kalispell, MT",1,3,,4.0,1/16/2016,Had the chicken bellagio and the avocado egg rolls.  Meal didn't disappoint.  The main dish was enough for two people and honestly the egg rolls could have been a meal as well. Wait staff was super friendly and attentive.
Nina M.,"Sacramento, CA",0,72,5,4.0,8/21/2015,I am a fan of the many cheesecakes. I don't like their sandwiches. I like their pasta dish and the steak dishes are fairly good. I come here twice a year.
Dakota J.,"Vacaville, CA",174,1,,3.0,1/13/2016,If I'm going to pay $7 for a beer; I better get a whole lemon slice. But cheesecake is bae.
Alex T.,"Sacramento, CA",1316,1002,6438,4.0,4/9/2015,"i came here on a Tuesday happy hour around 4 pm. i was excited to come here and try out the deep fried mac and cheese balls after the raving from my good friend. when i enter i was sat down in the bar area. i had looked at the happy hour menu and there was a big selection with lots of small bites and drinks available as well. i went ahead and order the deep fried mac and cheese balls and one luncheon special garlic noodles withe chicken. i was glad they offer the luncheon specials til 5pm and happy hour is on too. i also took advantage of the 3 dollar Stella with a slice of orange.  the bread they start you off was wonderful and fluffy warm and fresh. the wheat bread reminded me of black angus bread which i really love because its honey oat wheat bread. crisp and lightly sweet on the outside and fluffy in the inside. and when its warm and fresh outta the over its outstanding with some melted butter on it. lets start with the deep fried mac and cheese. they give you 4 pieces and on the outside it is a breaded bread crumb texture and in the inside as you bite into is creamy melted cheese covered pasta shells. it was amazing with the side or marinara sauce which seems like it was mixed with ranch or something inside the sauce. it paired very well and had all kinds of explosions of texture and flavors in my mouth like it was having a disco party. i rate this dish a 5 outta 5. it was amazing cheesy good!  now time to rate the garlic noodles pasta, it was a very nice and colorful pasta dish. i was offered some fresh Parmesan cheese and of course i will take some. i then tasted the noodles and it was very moist and buttery good. then the next bite was the char grilled chicken which was very flavorful. i almost got tricked that the chicken were boneless and when i bit into it there was a bone, so be careful. overall the dish was missing some black pepper and of course i i wish they had fresh pepper instead of table pepper. also to my thoughts the dish was a bit bland and not garlicky enough for me since i love it garlicky overall the menu says 12,95 but with chicken added to it is 2 dollars extra. overall the price was 14.95 which was on the pricier side.  overall my experience was great.  had a good time and like the vibe as well. the service was great and didn't leave our water empty. i like the big selection of happy hour and regular menu as well. they also serve brunch on Sundays and i am kind of excited to come here and try that out. also a note they don't have bottomless mimosas which was my first question for every brunch spot LOLZ.... but yea not bad prices fro brunch most items were 10 to 12 bucks but most expensive one was 14.95. i will be back for the terramisu cheesecake soon."
Erica C.,"San Leandro, CA",20,3,3,2.0,7/16/2015,"I came here along with my family for dinner tonight and service was horrible. Our server didn't even introduce herself to us. She didn't ask if we needed any bread or anything else (except water) until we asked. She didn't even come around often (just twice) and all we needed were a spoon and a bowl for our soups, so we asked another server instead. She looked like she didn't want to serve us at all (no smiles or anything).  We ordered two Renee's specials and a Louisiana chicken pasta as usual. Food were good as usual. But service was really bad so I was quite disappointed. This was my first time experiencing bad service at the Cheesecake Factory.  Oh, since she didn't introduce herself to us at first, I later found out her name on the bill (server: Celia H.)."
Sarita N.,"Sacramento, CA",94,154,15,5.0,9/22/2015,I love this restaurant. This is probably in my top five. I always come here when I go to the mall. The food and service is always on point.
Amber L.,"Sacramento, CA",14,22,12,4.0,10/20/2015,"Our server, Marie, made my day today. I was concerned about the type of bread the sandwich I wanted was on because of my braces. She took the time to work out a plan that would be best. She is very friendly and accommodating!"
Lor G.,"Carmichael, CA",0,42,8,2.0,6/11/2015,"I use to come here for their Skinnylicious herb crusted salmon salad served on a bed of baby greens with asparagus, tomato and tossed with their vinaigrette dressing. Today and the time before last, I have been very disappointed in the quality. They use to serve the salad with a freshly cooked salmon fillet. Now they actually state, 'Chilled Salmon' on their menu. Well, you know what that means! Cold salmon that has been sitting in the refrigerator (probably overnight). For $17 I expect fresh cooked salmon.... like right then, when I order it.  Since I have received the chilled salmon twice, I specifically asked the waiter to tell the cook in the back that I would like my salmon freshly prepared and not chilled.           Now my mama didn't raise no dumb bunny, and I know when I've been bamboozled. So, when my salad arrived, the salmon was room temp and dry as a piece of shoe leather. Which tells me that the cook took a piece of salmon out of the refrigerator and put it in the microwave to heat it up. I had to take sips of ice tea just to wash the dry (hard around the edges) Salmon down. I mentioned it to our waiter and he said that he specified ""freshly prepare salmon"" on the ticket and made special mention to the chef.  Chef! Really? There IS a difference between a chef and a short order cook, which I suspect is what the Cheese Cake Factory has cooking the food, back in the kitchen. Seriously, no ""chef"" worth his/her salt would ever let a piece of freshly grilled salmon come to a customer that dried out and tough All it takes is for me to be lied too. Then it leaves a bitter taste in my mouth for all their yummy desserts. Epic fail Cheese Cake Factory! I will certainly NOT be a returning customer. Tell it to your cheating  ""Chef""!"
Melissa C.,"Sacramento, CA",16,5,3,4.0,3/2/2013,"Theres many reasons why I love the Cheesecake Factory. First, their service is always great. Ive never had a bad server. Secondly their menu is HUGE! Theres definitely something on the menu for everyone. Compared to other restaurants, yes they can be pricey but their dinners are usually nicely portioned and always taste up to par. My number one favorite dish to order is the chipotle chicken pasta. Soooo delicious, and you will not be disappointed!!  Unfortunately I never tried the cheesecake lol, but their oreo shake is very good! A little on the expensive side, i believe around $8 but it is a big glass."
Charlie W.,"Stockton, CA",0,25,,1.0,7/31/2016,"Worse meal ever at CCF. Usually one of my favorite restaurants but went for Sunday brunch and never again.  Ordered waffle and fried chicken benedict. Took a long time to get our entrees and now I know why. Fried chicken was barely warm so had been sitting around for a while before being served. Potatoes were way overcooked and a very dark brown color and dried. Hollandaise sauce had no flavor. Only good thing was the maple syrup - guess it's hard to ruin something that you pour out of a bottle. Should have returned the meal, but it was Sunday after church so did not want to make a fuss."
Kristi J.,"Provo, UT",3,11,10,3.0,11/6/2015,Came here for a late night dinner because this was one of the only places that were open. The waiter wasn't very fast or took the time to check on us which I found a little annoying since I wanted a straw and he never stopped by so I could ask. Every Cheesecake Factory I've ever tried is usually just okay. This one was the same. I'm not disappointed because I expected it. I will say the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp though was probably the best dishes I've ever tried from them and I've tried my fair share of dishes from them.
Kim M.,"Sacramento, CA",1,16,,2.0,12/1/2015,"I've ordered the skinny garlic shrimp pasta from this location on two separate occasions during lunch. Both times I was very disappointed. I tried to complete a survey on their site and you can only do that if you're invited. Even during the call to ask about the survey, the two that picked up the phone did not ask if they could help me, take my concern. Both occasions the food was cold, yet I was 5 minutes after the ready in 10 minute window. I think it is safe to say they don't keep it warm. For the amount of food you get and during lunch, this dish is NOT worth $18.99."
Lynn H.,"Sacramento, CA",180,356,193,2.0,5/21/2012,"Yeah, after my one good experience - The Cheesecake Factory has dropped back into mediocrity. Their food was meh... I got the some kinda of peanut noodles... I guess I couldn't be mad at them for false advertising - Because it tasted exactly like peanut butter with noodles. Not so good.  My b/f got a sandwich... Nothing to write home about.  The cheesecake is usually pretty darn good but I got the pineapple upside down cheesecake... It was too fancy, I think. Anyway, not too happy with this place. I am always surprised to see how it could have such a long line when the food is very mediocre. I'll be back to use the rest of my giftcard, but I probably won't be coming back soon after."

I am always surprised to see how it could have such a long line when the food is very mediocre. I'll be back to use the rest of my giftcard, but I probably won't be coming back soon after."
