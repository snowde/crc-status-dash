Cali G.,"Sacramento, CA",0,3,,1.0,4/11/2016,Got the rib eye steak an mash with asparagus ...ugh next time just coming for the cheese cake. Steak is overly salty an the mash was dry as hell
Sequoia W.,"Sacramento, CA",0,1,,5.0,12/30/2015,I'm in love with the lemon herb and roasted chicken with mashed potatoes... A must have!!!
Amery S.,"Suisun City, CA",209,12,,2.0,12/27/2015,"Waitress was nice and their avocado egg rolls are great but the fillet minon was crap, also ordered Parmesan chicken which wasn't great but the mashed potatoes were good. Have been to this location before and the burgers were very underwhelming. Drinks are weak and it is loud and tables are too close together. Will not be coming back"
Anna K.,"Sacramento, CA",2,14,12,5.0,6/26/2014,"Best dinner with sisters at this place. The most delicious raspberry lemonade. And I always love trying new dishes, steaks, pastas, salads. Their cheesecakes are Devine. Try all the choices if possible :)"
Sally L.,"Sacramento, CA",72,15,5,5.0,11/22/2014,"Can't get over how amazing our server Michael aka Mike was! It's really hard nowadays to find a place with great food and amazing service! Bread was good, wine was excellent, main course was absolutely delicious, and of course the cheesecake is to die for, literally. Pumpkin cheesecake is heavenly!  Cheesecake Factory, you never fail me. :)"
Jonathan F.,"West Sacramento, CA",281,96,64,3.0,10/4/2015,"Not the biggest fun of this place. I still have yet to order the cheesecake from this place not much of a sweet tooth. There are always lines of folks waiting to order cheesecake, would love to see a Reese's peanut butter cheesecake and definitely would order one without question!"
Lerma T.,"North Highlands, CA",23,9,28,4.0,12/15/2014,Servings are huge. Great service.  We had a great time. My pasta was so delicous and the warm crab artichoke dip was superb!
Jenny F.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",222,25,11,2.0,4/4/2016,"Food is great, but the service was pretty awful. We were seated and it took about ten minutes for our waitress to even acknowledge us and when she did, she barely muttered a hello. I believe her name was Stephanie. Also, I just want to add that the restaurant was not busy at all. We have been there before and know that bread is standard. Not that we care about bread too much, but all other waitresses and waiters around us were serving bread and we never got any. We finally asked for some, just to see what she would say. She responded with ""I guess I can do that"". We received the bread with the meal, so we didn't even eat it. I asked the waitress to bring ranch with my food, she didn't and then disappeared. My boyfriend had to stand up and find another waitress to ask for it. We didn't see our waitress again until we paid. Overall kind of an awful experience. We felt like we were nagging the whole time for pretty standard things."
Mary Jane D.,"Citrus Heights, CA",15,24,,2.0,6/25/2016,We had a party of 14 - all adults. We tried to make reservations - they don't take reservations. So a couple of us got there early so we could get the table(s) prepared . . . they won't even do that until all members of the party are present. Yes the food is delicious and the service pretty good (not the best I've ever had tho) but even talking to the manager did not help us out. For my time and money I can think of A LOT of places to go that serves food as good as theirs and also allows large parties to make reservations. I also did not like the noise level - but that's probably because I'm a senior citizen.
Elwina R.,"Las Vegas, NV",29,2,2,5.0,10/27/2014,"Just a big shout out to our awesome server, Brett! Awesome service & great personality makes a great family birthday dinner for my cousin Arlene!  As always,  food was great as well!"
Sheree G.,"Citrus Heights, CA",70,109,12,3.0,9/26/2015,"I've eaten here a few times im always satisfied until I get my bill.  They Wayyy over charge for what you get.  The food is good yes, the cheesecakes are delishes the ambiance is okay but overpriced.   If your willing to pay the prices. .. go for it"
Lisa R.,"Sacramento, CA",28,8,,4.0,1/3/2016,"I'm a vegetarian and the crispy shrimp was fabulous. Of course, the cheesecake was awesome!"
Jenn M.,"Sacramento, CA",24,15,90,5.0,4/17/2014,I love this restaurant. I don't even eat cheesecake. I come for all the great food options. I love that they have a Skinnylicious menu. Huge menu but everything taste wonderful. If you want to go just for cheesecake my husband says it's totally worth it.
Lars S.,"Novato, CA",62,441,708,5.0,7/27/2014,"I love this place and have been to many of their locations over the years, including their Grand Lux Cafe at the Venetian in Las Vegas and in Scottsdale, AZ. I have never had a bad experience (except for the fact that you almost always have to wait for a table, but that's just part of the deal) and the service and food is ALWAYS top notch.  It's mind-boggling to me that they can juggle such an incredibly large menu and do it so well."
Jennifer S.,"Sacramento, CA",2,13,7,4.0,9/16/2014,"Me and my boyfriend went on a small date night here a week or so ago. We sat outside which at first I was a lol skeptical about cause I've heard you get bad service,BUT NOT HERE  just a general thing I've heard. But it was a beautiful night FOOD we just went for appetizers. I had the calamari and he had the pretzel chicken, these were amazing!! The pretzel chicken was a great combination of what ever that put in it! And my calamari I could even finish it it was a lot, but it's was soooooooo good but  I also are a lot of bread haha  SERVICE was great no more words needed  DESERT get the Carmel streusel!! It's not the official name but omg it's good"
Alina G.,"Sacramento, CA",0,4,,1.0,11/14/2015,"I signed up for yelp just so I can write this review. I went into Cheesecake Factory recently and there was a long wait, which is fine, but I decided to go to the bar for a drink. I ordered a classic margarita with an extra shot ( the original drink was too sweet). I was content with my drink until I got the bill. My bill, without the tip, was $23. I don't see how one drink can end up being so much! The tequila was nothing special like Petron, so the price did not equal the quality. I suggest that no one orders what I did because they will be highly disappointed. I love this restaurant because the food is good, and it's close, but I don't think I will be going back here again."
T T.,"Sonora, CA",0,17,,2.0,12/21/2015,"First things first, expect to pull your phone out immediately when you sit down to look at the menu because you can't see shit. The food is okay, not particularly good. The New York cheesecake wasn't that good tasting and was over-whipped, pretty disgraceful for a place called 'The Cheesecake Factory'. My salad I ordered was so overly-dressed that I couldn't even eat it. And the potatoes I got with my food were way too salty. The pasta I ordered was bland. This place is not all that, and overly priced."
Christina O.,"Sacramento, CA",66,28,18,5.0,8/1/2014,"My best friend & I took our four children out for cheesecake:D It was 50 percent off each cheesecake ! Cant beat that! Andrew was our server , he was awesome & he kept checking up to make sure we didnt need anything & kept our drinks filled! made sure we understood the menu we had no complaints  It was about a 45 minute wait but totally worth it !"
G S.,"Sacramento, CA",1,3,4,5.0,10/3/2014,"Arrived 15 min before 5:00pm and it wasn't busy at all. Other times I've been here, it was really busy and the wait times were always over 30 min but that's expected.  Our waitress was sweet and very attentive. She came and checked up on us in a timely manner. Didn't bother us much but made sure we were taken care of.  I had the Shrimp and Chicken Gumbo this time and it was good. It lacked the spice it mentioned in the menu description but it was still good. The shrimp and chicken was perfectly cooked and tasted oh so good with the sauce. I also ordered a Passionfruit Mojito. It was way too sweet for my taste but it got me feeling good so that was a plus. For dessert I had the Pumpkin Pecan cheesecake. That was a disappointment. It tasted like a pumpkin pie. Nothing ""cheesecake"" about it. Not only that it was still kinda frozen.  All in all, good food and good service every time I've been here. 5 stars. The disappointing cheesecake wasn't enough to take off a star ;)"
Dan T.,"Sacramento, CA",57,9,494,4.0,4/8/2012,"I am only giving this place 4 stars because I love their cheesecake. They have the best cheesecake! Servers are nice, friendly and on task.  I'm not a fond of their food, but I do enjoy their Chicken Madeira. The menu is just too big, portions are really big and it's good to share. I probably would not order Ahi Carpaccio, Stuffed Mushrooms, Warm Crab & Artichoke Dip again. Maybe the Fried Macaroni and Cheese, but I had better."
