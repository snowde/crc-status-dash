Brie M.,"Sacramento, CA",21,104,11,5.0,7/19/2014,"I love this place. Been here with a party of 20, 2 and 7, each time the service was prompt and attentive!  Ambience: a bit above casual. Nice comfy seating. High ceilings but it's not like those warehouse style restaurants.  Food: Always good. Ive had all their happy hour appetizers and they are great. The fish + chips are super good (impressive because they were so meaty!+crispy). Jumbalaya is tazty. Shepherds pie is delish. Burrito is good and gigantic.  Drinks: happy hour has good prices. Had the tea and mojitos and this pink lemonade stuff, all of which were great. Price: average.  $8-20/person (depending on your appetite). I don't mind paying more for consistently good service and food. I'm always down to eat here."
Bob M.,"Pleasanton, CA",3,7,,5.0,10/25/2015,"The food is okay, there are better places. But come here for the wonderful ambience and the life changing Cheesecake. Service is great, even with larger parties. For a great birthday night it's a haven, but be warned weekend nights are uber crowded."
C P.,"Elk Grove, CA",40,17,95,5.0,8/23/2014,The atmosphere is great. Large menu selection. Good vibe and good service. I will definitely come back. I love lava flows. They serve a Caribbean cooler which taste just like it. Yummy
Veronica S.,"Sacramento, CA",132,279,415,4.0,6/4/2014,Love this place! Cheesecake is delicious and food is great too. Keep in mind that the portions are pretty big. I ordered a couple appetizers with my friend and by the time our main dish came out we were full! It is a little pricy but you get a ton of food. Service is great. Our waiters have always been very friendly and the food never takes too long to come out.
dom V.,"Sacramento, CA",2,22,11,1.0,4/29/2016,"Horrible bartender. We sat down at the bar at 4 and no one was there but the two of us. She didn't greet us. Took 3-5 min to bring us water. She didn't lay down the white mats. Didn't offer or bring us bread. I ordered two apps of happy hour. My husband ordered pasta. My appetizers came out in about 8 min. We didn't hear about the pasta at all. 40 min later she ""checks"" on the pasta and says its not ready. Yet I see pasta and other foods comin out to tables who ordered after us. She clearly didn't ring in my husbands pasta. Didn't admit that she didn't ring in the pasta. And didn't apologize about the pasta. He was so pissed we ended up at leatherbys after so he could actually eat dinner. She didn't clear any of our plates the entire time, even after I ordered cheesecake.  (SIDENOTE: lemon meringue cheesecake is bomb) AND I put my card with the check for 10 min and she still didn't come by to cash us out. So I left cash and we left. Not going back."
Samantha C.,"Sacramento, CA",0,111,24,4.0,7/19/2015,"You know, CF is consistently great. It is my top pick for a chain type restaurant. I don't like cheesecake but can't  resist their key lime. My favorite favorite favorite here is lettuce wraps!!!"
Tim G.,"Sacramento, CA",3,67,27,2.0,3/23/2014,"At best you should be thankful people like cheese cake... You get what you pay for is not as accurate as you would think here. You have good food for what I would expect from a huge chain... Denny's is also good and yes, you are on the same corporate pre-cooked bagged pseudo-chef crap level. Here is where YOU screw your customers and STAFF!!! $12 for a mixed drink!!! Are you kidding Me?!? I will pay it, knowing that I will take every damn dollar back, out of the TIP! Shame on you for selling Well drinks at top shelf prices!!! By the way, your bar staff needs to know how to mix drinks... really have a hard time understanding how they don't get the basics."
Patrick Y.,"Sacramento, CA",1138,118,1257,4.0,9/7/2010,"Favorite place for Happy Hour.  Not for the drinks, but for the eats!!!  Food is always consistant and there is always something for everyone with their huge selection of menu items. The Ultimate Red Velvet Cheesecake is a winner!  Also try the Lemoncello Cream Torte when you want something with a little zest!! The waiter, Patrick, is awesome and he will remember your name!!!"
Michael H.,"West Sacramento, CA",440,212,415,5.0,11/4/2013,"I have been to this place on more than 5 occasions and I would always seem to have great service. I would mainly order the miso salmon dish and I have always enjoyed it! If you come here during lunch time, the lunch portion is plenty of food! I would definitely come here for the delicious food and excellent service!"
Melissa B.,"Placerville, CA",409,140,68,5.0,2/1/2014,"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place. It doesn't matter what you're in the mood for, they have it. 23 pages - how could you not find something you'd love!? Josh C. was literally the greatest server I have ever had in my entire life - everything about him was perfect. every restaurant needs a server like him. (: This has always been and always will be my favorite restaurant.  GO GO GO!"
Issy D.,"Sacramento, CA",771,562,70,4.0,8/26/2012,"Ok, so it's the Cheesecake Factory. It's not somewhere you want to go super often, but it is fun every so often. The drinks are super sugary but yummy. And the skinnylicous menu is actually pretty big. I decided to get salmon from the the ""skinnylicous"" menu (stupid name.....) and it was so good! I just can't jusifty eating a 7000 calorie pasta dish....... But I of course have to treat myself to red velvet cheesecake....ummmmm yum! Yum yum!"
Truan N.,"Elk Grove, CA",11,21,,2.0,8/18/2015,"Great food, bad service. Pretty much the service ruin our appetite. We usually come here for dinner once a month, but it's time for a new place. Cook/server came out with our food looking like he fell on the floor in a pile of dirt. Our waiter has a creepy tone of voice, which I'm not sure if he's trying hard or playing a role. Anyway, I strongly believe they did something to our food because my fiance and I had to take a crazy number 2 in the middle of the night. This place has gotten fishy..."
J. G.,"Concord, CA",0,13,,1.0,10/25/2015,"We had a small family gathering today at this restaurant for several elderly siblings. Our waitress was incredibly rude, condescending and disrespectful. When we asked that she be replaced, management provided another waitress who was very nice. However, our original waitress continued to hang around the table interfering and interrupting. This woman should be fired and never work in a service industry again. Evidently this is not the first time managements received these types of complaints about her."
Wendy B.,"Corona, CA",1657,2025,7082,3.0,12/1/2011,"Another chain.  My sisters choice for Thanksgiving (plus one day).  Not my choice then.  Not my choice now either.  Clam chowder:  Grossly over seasoned with herbs.  Shepherds Pie: Tasted funny. Sent it back. At least the mashed potatoes were alright.  Came with salad. Vegetable and goat cheese pizza:  OK. Herbed Salmon:  Delicate and moist. Came with asparagus and a rich cream sauce.  Also, a side salad that was crisp and generous. Angel hair pasta with a chunky tomato sauce.  Looked boring, saw my brother in law dumping lots of Parmesan cheese on it.  I personally did not taste it. Dessert: Plain cheesecake, no topping.  Only ok.  I am definitely ruined by my Mom's homemade lemon cheesecake.  And Marie Callenders Kahlua Cream Cheese pie. Ah. So, now on to the really good things:   The manager was more than just attentive.  He made sure Mr. B got a good substitution for the Shepherd's Pie.  We packed it to go, since everyone had finished eating and he had nibbled on other things and had lost his appetite.  The Salisbury steak he recommended was decent and worked well for another meal.  Five gold stars for that manager! Luau Salad:  Really great, but way too much sesame dressing.  If there were a next time, it would have to be served on the side.  Ingredients included crispy wonton squares, carrots, cukes, sweet peppers, lightly cooked green beans, mango cubes, macadamias, large chunks of chicken, and sesame seeds.  The winner of all our selections and quite filling. Service was good."
Meghan M.,"Sacramento, CA",73,117,,3.0,3/31/2014,"I try to get into the hype of this place....but honestly I can't. The food is just O-K, nothing to rant or rave about. I rarely get the cheesecake, it just do it for me. Happy hour is nice but, I can go A LOT of places for happy rather than drive all the way to Arden and fight through traffic and random teenage children in that parking lot. I came here Sunday for lunch with my family as we were hosting another family who wanted to go.  (IDK why but whatevs) The bread that the waitress brought over was cold and hard. I'm still unsure why she even served it when she said it wasn't fresh but there was some fresh bread coming out that she would bring that back (she never brought it back btw). I ordered the grilled salmon with mashed potatoes and broccoli. The salmon was really good; fresh, grilled just right and a nice size for a lunch portion. The Mashed potatoes had great flavor but were a weird consistency. They were creamy but had big chunks of potato in them (idk how they managed that) like they creamed them and then put chunks back it *shrug* ; then the broccoli...deepsigh...It was as if they took the smallest sprigs they could find and gave them to me, they were so soggy ( they seemed like they were frozen and then thawed, and super salty.  Our waitress was ""ehh"". She kept getting me confused with the other girl at the table, presumably we looked alike??? brown skin, natural hair... whatevs... another conversation for another day....She made it awkward every time she came to the table to ask us for something, since we were talking it was like we were interrupting her trying to serve... The best thing about the experience was my strawberry lemonade and the free refills...oh and walking to my car...."
Nicole B.,"Citrus Heights, CA",133,191,84,4.0,1/20/2014,"I came here with a friend over the weekend. Luckily the weather was nice enough to sit outside. Our waiter was very polite and timely when it came to taking our orders and checking in on us. He brought us bread and butter right away to snack on while we waited for our meal.  The menu is quite overwhelming. I always thought the menu at The Cheesecake Factory was way too big. My friend and I decided to share the Thai lettuce cups. I like the appearance of the food as it came out. However, the flavor was just okay. I have had better lettuce cups elsewhere. I also was not a fan of how the served the chicken. It comes in big pieces, so we had to dice it up to fit in the lettuce pieces. Parking can be a pain when it is busy because of the location close to the mall. They offer valet if you don't feel like dealing with finding a spot."
Ike R.,"Sacramento, CA",7,86,96,5.0,5/12/2014,"Stopped in to the Cheese Cake Factory on Easter Sunday 2014 , what a nice place . Our party of 7 had a wonderful time with no complaints whatsoever . The staff was very helpful from taking our picture to expediting my margarita . Of course it is 'a' large chain type of restaurant but they are sure doing something right and I am sometimes amazed when things are so well executed . When I have the time I like to check the menu before arriving just to get an idea of what they serve , but did not get a chance to do that on this visit as our first destation was closed [the menu is extensive but needed (?) at a place like this] - food 5* - service 5* - cleanliness 5* - value (someone grabbed the check before I could but the prices on the menu seemed reasonable for what your getting) 5* - intangible / vibe / over all feel 5*  average (hold on let me figure this) 5*"
Gabriel B.,"Sacramento, CA",83,2,,5.0,7/29/2015,"Great Food !!! Shout out to the fried mac and cheese balls! So good, I get them every time I come"
Nani V.,"Sacramento, CA",294,445,301,4.0,3/4/2012,Buffalo Blasters - amazing! Spicy Chicken tacos a little bland. Nice beer selections. Red velvet cheesecake was rich and good. Service was quick and our waitress was very nice.
Gina M.,"Citrus Heights, CA",134,35,20,5.0,2/23/2015,"A friend and I visited last Friday for lunch and it was a great experience! The staff was very friendly, greeted us nicely, made sure we had everything we needed! I had the Fresh Vegetable Salad. Not my fave salad...I'd sub field greens next time instead of the romain - but it still tasted great and was big enough to fill me up! Thanks again CF!"
