TC S.,"West Sacramento, CA",2,7,,2.0,4/15/2016,"The food is tasty, but the service her is absolutely horrible.  Glass always empty, food took a quiye a while, and the server hardly checked on us except he was more than fast to deliver and pick up the check....it is not cheap nor overly expensive to eat here, but it's disappointing to get such terrible service every time. Not sure I can return to try again..."
Shari M.,"Woodbridge, CA",2,20,12,5.0,8/19/2015,"I had the Steak Diane with shrimp scampi and the steak was prepared perfectly. The mashed potatoes were a little pasty but the flavor was very good. Our waitress was Edyta and she is the best waitress I have ever encountered at any restaurant. She fills your drinks & gives you just the right amount of attention. I can not say enough good things about her. If you can sit in her section, I would highly recommend it. Good job Cheesecake Factory for understanding amazing service, makes for an amazing meal."
Noelle R.,"Natomas, Sacramento, CA",110,8,,5.0,2/15/2014,"My boyfriend and I went on the busiest night: Valentine's Day. It was packed and the wait was long, but the service and food was so good that I didn't even care. It was wonderful all around. I had the Louisiana Chicken Pasta and the Cherry Cheesecake and it was perfect! My boyfriend had the gumbo and he said it was the perfect amount of spice and was very delicious.  I will definitely return. Great atmosphere, great service. Good job, team!"
Michael Y.,"Colorado Springs, CO",2,20,16,5.0,6/10/2014,"I've been here a bunch of times. Food is always great. I've been eating off the skinnylishess, Menu. Each selected so far is excellent.   Only had the stawberry cheese cake but its great. The wait staff is friendly and usually prompt.  This location Is close To The Hilton Doubletree which I stay At while in town.  I will be back for more!"
Jackie B.,"Sacramento, CA",177,210,326,3.0,1/20/2015,Fun fact of the day: Cheesecake Factory serves eggs and omelets all day! Had a nice egg white omelet at 9pm with asparagus in it. Yummmm. Just kind've overpriced.
Paine N.,"Sacramento, CA",99,13,6,4.0,6/7/2014,"If you want to save room for dessert, definitely share a plate with someone. Lunch and dinner comes with free sour dough and wheat (or is it rye) bread. I like the wheat one a lot! It's soft and a little sweet; it tastes well with the melted butter.   My bf and I were just there for lunch. We shared a regular sized sun dried tomato and chicken fettuccine. It will full you up! It's creamy and a bit tangy from the tomatoes. It's good, but not special. But how special can pasta get?  I generally order a slice of Godiva cheesecake, one of the best cheesecakes I have eaten so far. I love dark chocolate, so the degree of bitterness is great for me. I remember the first time I had it, right after I swallow that first bite, I felt a cool feeling in my mouth. It is a must try!  So I decided to try something different, the Reese's cake cheesecake. It was too sweet for me, but it would be good for someone who loves milk chocolate and peanut butter. For me, the cake layer took up too much space compared to the cheesecake layer. It was too rich and too high in calories for me to eat it all at once, so as usual, I finished it in 2 days (with my bf's help)!  The Godiva cheesecake is still my favorite and I'm still on the quest to finding the best one!"
Sarah G.,"Galt, CA",135,214,225,3.0,3/19/2014,"I don't come here often, as I prefer more original eateries, but they do have a large (clearly) variety of cheesecakes and my favorite appetizer/entrée - the thai lettuce wraps - however, its often crowded on the weekends with a long wait."
Rebecca J.,"Monterey Park, CA",3,240,2,3.0,5/16/2015,"I guess I'm just not a Cheesecake Factory person in general. Maybe I'm super dooper sensitive, but I get sick every time I eat here. Most things are way greasy I feel like I'm drinking oil, and it is overpriced in my opinion. I don't mind paying a big bill for food, but it has to be of quality. This place just does not cut it for me. However, three stars because it is clean here and staff is nice, and because every one of my friends in the area loves it...to each their own I guess."
Nai S.,"Sacramento, CA",167,42,22,4.0,3/16/2014,"I've always been a big fan of this restaurant. My sister and I went to each lunch today and I'm glad we did because when we arrived it wasn't too busy just yet. The server was very nice and prompt to help us order our food. We got the spicy chicken chipotle pasta and Louisiana chicken pasta, both which were delicious that had a nice kick to it."
Aimi S.,"Sacramento, CA",0,4,,5.0,7/1/2015,Got seated quickly and waiter was very friendly. Overall great service and delicious food. Love the chicken quesadillas we had for appetizers!
Jenny C.,"Los Angeles, CA",391,160,175,4.0,9/29/2011,"I personally feel that Cheesecake Factory is underappreciated in terms of their food. Admittedly, I haven't tried the vast majority of their extensive menu, but some of my favorite dishes are Steak Diane, Chicken Madeira, Pasta Da Vinci, and Cajun Jambalaya Pasta. The meats are cooked well, the sauces are flavorful, and the portions are generous. Also, the service is responsive and the ambiance is casual, but elegant. On weekends, I come here for the Lunch Special. I am particularly fond of the pizza and side salad special. Delicious, comes with enough food to take home, and very affordable.  My only gripe is that their prices can be a bit steep. Many of the meat and pasta dishes are around $18, which is the main reason I don't eat here more often. Yet at the same time, there are dozens of restaurants I can think of with cheaper prices but far worse tasting food. I'd rather spend the extra money and leave satisfied than save a little and leave having eaten a mediocre and forgettable meal."
Jenn B.,"Sacramento, CA",3,16,,1.0,7/30/2015,We came here for national cheesecake day because half off cheesecake of course. We got seated quickly surprisingly but the table was really small and in a corner. Servers kept walking pass bumping my chair which was rather annoying. It took awhile for us to get some bread. The food came and they messed up order put onions when I asked for none sent back so had to wait. The food was okay not a big fan of it. Waiting for dessert I made a trip to the bathroom and 4 out of 5 stalls had no toliet paper what an inconvenience especially in a nice restaurant like this. Service was okay but too many mess ups made me kinda mad. Definitely wont be back for the food unless I just get dessert.
Alyssa T.,"Sacramento, CA",2,40,35,3.0,4/19/2014,"Went here for lunch with my friend and we ordered salads. The salad was huge and I could have shared it with another person. I also had the fried zucchini which was good as well. I really liked the ranch that came with the zucchini.  The only concern I had was the waitress report-mending the new waitress. I  thought that was unprofessional. I felt embarrassed for the new waitress. The waitress may have good customer service skills, but she needs to be trained on training others around customers."
Nancy T.,"Sacramento, CA",122,47,82,4.0,3/7/2012,"MMmmm.. as soon as I walk in my mouth starts to water for the cheese cakes!! I stand there in front of the display like a little kid trying to figure out which one I want to try out at the end of our dinner!  We ended up ordering the Chicken samosas, Crab cake bites, side salad with house vinaigrette and the Rib eye.  The chicken samosas were yummy... but the cilantro dip was a little too plain. I tasted more of the sour cream. but otherwise still a yummy appetizer. It came with 4 samosas.  The crab cake bites were scrumptious!!! Perfectly fried and paired with a mustard dipping sauce. I would say that the 6 mini bites are equivalent to 1 regular size crab cake.  As far as the side salad goes... there really isn't much to say, beside that the purple cabbage should either be drenched in the vinaigrette or at least be separated so it is able to absorb some more of the dressing as well.  The rib eye was fine. It was cooked a little too well done. We asked for medium. But it was still ok. Nothing to brag about here.  MMMMmmm...Dessert... unfortunately, we did not get to order any dessert because I was too stuffed from dinner, but I'm sure it would have been like all my other visits, yummy and way too sweet for me, but still scrumptious!!!"
Miranda H.,"Lodi, CA",160,119,279,4.0,11/29/2013,"Steak Diane was excellent tonight, our server was great as always this was my third time here she was our server the first time and she always steers you in the right direction for appetizers entrees and of course cheesecake I wish I caught her name she made sure our drinks were nice and full! We were sat quickly tonight which was strange considering it is Black Friday the hostess was also very gracious unlike the one last time who thought it was baffling that we asked for a booth. New abortive cheesecake the white chocolate blueberry too bad I only had two bites because I was stuffed from my crap and artichoke appetizer and my steak Diane. This is a place everyone needs to try at least once!!"
G M.,"Sacramento, CA",39,69,4,4.0,5/27/2014,Packed and very busy. A large chain and they have their marketing down. Service good and the variety of items on the menu make it hard to choose. I was with a group of 9 and everybody liked their selections. The entrees came at a timely speed and we were in and out in a little over an hour. Pricing a little higher than BJ's and The Yard House. I will consider a repeat. No I did not try any cheesecake.
J J.,"Sacramento, CA",0,5,1,2.0,5/9/2016,"We had them cater our Mother's Day brunch this weekend and we were pretty disappointed with how the food came out. We paid over $300 for the catering package, an extra entree and a cheesecake. The avocado egg rolls were so soggy we were unable to eat them. They tasted almost like they had been made the day before. We ordered the chicken costoletta and the famous factory meat loaf. They did not give us the sauce for the chicken costoletta. Which as you know , the sauce makes the meal! Ive had the chicken costoletta from them before and it was delicious. Not quite sure where they went wrong but it was a disappointment. I would recommend eating there at the restaurant but never their catering, especially for a special event. The food servings and portions where good size. But the quality of the food prepared was severely lacking considering the amount of money we paid."
Patrick M.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",218,493,113,3.0,10/26/2013,"Well if you have been to one of these you have been to them all. The menu is the same here and there and well it's just kind of bland, middle of the road, ill prepared, and overpriced food. It's great if that is what you're looking for, but not me personally. In my opinion there are 2 reasons to come here the first is the squaw bread you can at your table and the second is the obvious cheesecake.  You're not going to get amazing or stellar service here. It is no longer an mid to upscale place to go have a lunch or dinner because it is cram packed full of families with screaming children and annoying teenagers. I think my favorite reason to go here is to watch the people who eat these gigantic portions on a regular basis and are just as gigantic getting stuck in the chairs.  So go get an excellent dinner elsewhere and then stop in and get some cheesecake at the bar or to go."
Live For Foo D.,"Sacramento, CA",0,75,2,4.0,12/25/2014,We went there on Christmas Eve. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable.  The menu is amazing and the food was great.  I you read my reviews you know one of my pet peeves is that restaurants try to serve you French fries that have been sitting under a heat lamp rather than cooking them fresh to order.  This place DID a great job and cooked everything to order. I had a French dip. The meat was fresh and juicy.  Over all this place did a great job.
Victoria S.,"Santa Rosa, CA",1,26,12,3.0,7/23/2015,"We were in town for the fair. Wanted a change for the evening.  Not a bad wait arriving at 6pm. No parking in the area and since I've had knee surgery had to valet.  I ordered the steak diane with shrimp scampi. First they forgot the shrimp,then the steak was cold. Husband ordered the crusted salmon and he loved it.  Ordered a slice of the vanilla bean cheesecake to go.  I got a bite, husband loves it.  Highly recommend Cheesecake Factory.  We like the one in Corte Madera where we live.  Service is much better."
