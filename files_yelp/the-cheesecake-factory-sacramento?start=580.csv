Kimber T.,"Mokelumne Hill, CA",0,2,,4.0,1/30/2015,"my husband and I  had a great dinner. we had a small issue with our food, it was resolved with 2 free cheese cakes to go home. as always a very well run business and restaurant.  thanks  cheesecake factory......."
Connie C.,"Elk Grove, CA",510,376,344,4.0,2/5/2014,"Cheesecake Factory was the first restaurant I loved moving down here. The portions are huge, the selection is plenty and the cheesecake is yummy! You can order various types of food (Asian, Mexican, American) and there are 2 pages of cheesecake and other cakes. I'm not a fan of the chocolate cheesecakes because they can be really rich and I feel 5 years old asking for milk. The carrot cake and banana cheesecake are my faves because they're lighter but decadent. Prices can be a little pricey once you start adding appetizers and then entree and then dessert. But it's one of those places I feel it's necessary to shovel food in like a cow..."
Kenneth A.,"Los Angeles, CA",26,49,125,2.0,1/21/2014,"I had dinner with a colleague here last week. Initially the service was slow. It took forever to get the first round of drinks. Our appetizer (soup) was spilled on the table and not cleaned up until we asked for it to be done. Our entrees were brought to the table put then paraded around other customers because we asked for the table to be cleaned before setting the plates. My entree' was not prepared as asked. The staff seemed a bit aloof. The manager was gracious and offered to make things right and we appreciated that.  The drinks were very good. The company and conversation was by far the best. However, I won't be back to this location."
Shaunta R.,"Sacramento, CA",554,45,33,4.0,3/24/2015,Menu is huge might want to study before you go. Make sure you get a piece of the many cheese cakes i also love the carrot Cake.
Tajster H.,"Chico, CA",224,51,33,5.0,3/22/2015,Came for brunch.  The food was awesome.  I had the monte Cristo which was cooked perfectly.  The potatoes was the best I've ever had.  Jillian was my server and she gave is excellent service with a smile.  Great staff.
Nicole B.,"Sacramento, CA",499,244,224,2.0,9/29/2014,"Ehh. I was actually disappointed with my experience here. Let me start by saying the staff was great! From host to busser, to waitress to manager! But the food, oh my, not worth it. My boyfriend and I love-LOVE The Cheesecake Factory and have shared some of out greatest memories at the Los Angeles location however, this place tasted like a completely different restaurant and thats not a good thing. The food was very bland, had no flavor and was lacking any sort of ""I'm worth $25 a plate... I will not come back to this location, both mine and my boyfriend's food tasted awful. If there is another one near you, give it a try or take your stomach space elsewhere because this location it not worth it."
Billy P.,"Plumas Lake, CA",46,62,61,4.0,10/18/2011,"Have a sweet tooth, not sure what to eat?  Two words, Cheesecake Factory..   Trendy spot for family and friends right next to the Arden Mall.  Over 200 menu selections of glamburgers, pastas, steaks, pizzas, breakfasts, adult beverages, desserts, and last but not least the most popular 35 different cheesecakes.   Went here for dessert after watching football with some great friends.  Ordered the Godiva chocolate brownie sundae, and wow was it big!!  Very rich chocolate brownies layered between scoops of vanilla ice cream and topped off with whip cream (had to run extra miles because of this).  Muy tasty!!! Great atmosphere indoors and outdoors for family and friends.  Huge variety of food for all times of the day.  Service was on point, our waitress was quick to respond to anything we threw at her (especially knives).  Go on off times for eating unless you want to wait 30 minutes to an hour (Our wait was approx 15 min).  Dine in or take out.  A must-stop by and check out their cheesecake display.  Definitely love this place!!!"
B T.,"Sacramento, CA",0,12,,5.0,7/2/2015,"I love coming here.  Their Louisiana Chicken pasta is out of this world.  Yummy!  I always order a side of fries, a whole plate for just a few bucks...totally worth it.  Their frozen ice mango smoothie is delicious.  And of course, the cheesecakes are to die for.  Service and ambience is great too."
Yolanda E.,"Modesto, CA",87,18,16,5.0,4/8/2015,"The staff here is great ! Even if the food wasn't what I liked, I'd like to say the staff was always ready to help. They made my experience at the Cheesecake Factory very pleasant. Why I rate a 5 is because service is very important to me. I'm not going to blame the waitress for my food not tasting right, it's how they approached the situation & fixed the problem. Love the cheesecake! Great staff!"
Samantha L.,"Sacramento, CA",294,553,1160,3.0,7/26/2011,"My boyfriend and I have been to this Cheesecake Factory location several times; we have come for dinner, drinks, or just dessert.  Comparing it to other Cheesecake Factory locations I've been to, this one is just so-so.  The food is about the same, of course, but the service is not as attentive and somehow there's always a wait. I tend to avoid Cheesecake Factory right around dinner-time just because it always means a wait.  However, if you come later on in the night, especially on weeknights, there usually will be a number of open tables.  My boyfriend and I usually will pick out a cheesecake from the display and share a piece. On our last visit, we shared the Mango Key-lime cheesecake.  It had a nice (kind of different) tartness to it.  It was worth a try, but not as great as other cheesecakes I've had there.  What I like about the Cheesecake Factory is that there are always new flavor combinations of cheesecakes available.  My boyfriend and I really like to try new things, rather than just sticking with what we've had before, so this is a great way to try new desserts/cheesecakes. Notes: -If you don't want to wait, you can order a slice of cheesecake to go.  They package it nicely and still give you plenty of whipped cream. -There is plenty of parking because it's located in a giant parking lot.  They even have valet parking if you're interested."
Geneva L.,"Sacramento, CA",185,190,134,4.0,1/10/2014,"I had been to this restaurant at Arden Fair a few years ago for a family dinner and I wasn't impressed with food or service. Therefore, I wasn't looking forward to dinner again. at this semi-upscale chain restaurant known for their cheesecake and multifaceted American menu. Much to my surprise, I was really impressed with the staffing, timing, and comfortable environs. We were seated quickly, our drinks and orders taken and food on the table, all in under 30 minutes. Prices are reasonable and service was really good. The kitchen did an amazing job with our large party's diverse orders. I loved the classic burger with mesclun salad on the side- a great deal for $10.95. Would go back again- and I really do need to try the cheesecake!"
Lizette R.,"Davis, CA",178,105,198,4.0,3/4/2015,We all know their cheesecake is amazing!!!!! But did you also know their hamburgers are so so good? I didn't either! My boyfriend and I recently dined here. He ordered the all american burger and I ordered spring rolls (big mistake). His plate was obviously more appetizing than my plate.  My plate was dry and boring. What was I thinking ordering spring rolls here! I could probably make better spring rolls than the ones they served me. However their strawberry martini was delicious!
Cici F.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",61,21,174,4.0,4/29/2013,"Oh Yes....I was very satisfied! Mmm mm mm!!!  If you've never been to Cheesecake Factory I suggest that you try their Chicken Madeira...it never disappoints! And it shouldn't being that it costs $17.95. The positive side of that price is that its enough for 2 people to eat! As a matter of fact..even their ""lunch"" size meals are enough for 2 to share (if you don't want it all for yourself like me).  This meal is so good that it even made the nuked Styrofoam plate that I warmed the leftovers on taste good! (I don't advise you to use Styrofoam plates...it may not be too healthy for ya to intake but in this instance I COULD CARE LESS! Nom nom nom :)  The service was great! We got plenty of refills of the complimentary bread and butter so we didn't even bother to order appetizers. Its located outside of Arden Mall (duh) so be prepared for there to be a crowd. We went around 5pm on a Sunday and for a party of 4, we didn't have but a 5 minute wait to be seated. That's awesome! This is a go to place for a nice family experience. And we always leave with doggy bags. So if the price scares you (about $64.00 to feed 4 people, that's without ordering dessert. We were too full), just know that you are pretty much getting two meals in one. So CHILL! :) All in all, it was a good experience."
Raymond V.,"Sacramento, CA",26,7,3,1.0,5/15/2014,I came here on a friday night and the place was super packed. The wait time for 6 people was horrendous. We literally waited for 2 hours....  Their menu is really big and has lots of choices. It took me a while to order.... The waiter was nice about it or at least looked like he was. I ordered a burger and from the menu it sounded good.. But it turned out to be very dry.. The food here is NOT worth the wait!!! It was my cousins birthday so we told the waiter after we ordered. Hoping he would bring a desert after dinner. Not only did he forget... But it was not complimentary. It was 8$ for a cheesecake. Jeez...  Nice place to go if you want to be fancy but not really worth it. Id rather take my money somewhere else.
Jasmine H.,"Vallejo, CA",11,22,10,5.0,3/26/2014,"Everything I've ordered here (mostly an array of appetizers) has been delicious, it can be noisy and a bit dim at night, servers were nice, my food came out so fast even the waitress was surprised haha. The prices are a bit high but the quality and quantity were appropriate. The ambiance was lovely, very popular place."
Cat M.,"Long Beach, CA",4,130,61,4.0,3/25/2015,"Consistently good food. A successful chain restaurant, which is rare these days. Lots of options. Good for kids because they play loud music at night. Service is average. Love the chicken picatta and chicken madeira. In fact, I haven't really ever had bad food here. Cheesecake is always wonderful. Apple crisp and tiramisu are also very tasty. Very rich food that satisfies,  so don't overeat.  It is easy to do so."
Tiffany K.,"Sacramento, CA",812,1020,303,4.0,4/4/2011,"Maybe I'm flogging a dead horse, 'cause 22 of my best Yelpie friends have already said their two cents about the Cheesecake Factory. HOWEVER none of them mentioned the Happy Hour which is Monday-Friday from 4:00 - 6:00.  Call me uneducated, but I never really thought of a place called 'Cheesecake Factory' to have a killer happy hour. The appetizer portions are full sized which means you could totally make a meal out of these things! Sure they are deep fried and probably contain a gazillion calories, but they sure go nicely with a $5 Cosmo.  What I can recall from the $5 appetizer menu: * Deep friend avocado rolls - I have been told that these are fantastic * Fried Macaroni & Cheese cubes * Calamari - very tender, great aioli sauce * Sweet corn tamale cakes * Buffalo Blasts - rice paper wrapped spicy chicken that is (you guessed it) deep fried * Fried chicken sliders Drink-wise, they had long islands, margaritas, cosmpolitans, etc. all for $5. They make great drinks too!  So yeah, it is a chain, but for a chain, the service is good, the food is good (huge portions!) and the ambiance - while a bit over the top - is nice. Looking around, you had your office parties, birthday dinners, families, couples and dates. My friend Theresa had the Red Velvet Cheesecake. She shared some with me and OMG - if I had to die by cheesecake, this would be the one."
Janelle M.,"Fair Oaks, CA",4349,597,3618,4.0,8/21/2011,"Came for lunch, the food is great, the staff is friendly and it didn't take long to place my order, I must say it does get quite busy here."
Alexandria M.,"Carmichael, CA",24,20,2,3.0,3/3/2015,"Eh. The menu is huge, the food's pretty acceptable, and the cheesecake is good. But outrageous wait times with no reservation policy is kinda stupid."
Ashley D.,"Sacramento, CA",0,3,,5.0,9/12/2013,"It was a Wednesday afternoon, around 4pm. The restaurant hadn't filled up with a dinner rush yet and my friend and I decided to sit at the bar for drinks and happy hour food. Don was our bartender and I'm so happy he was. He made sure to ask us exactly how we wanted our martinis prepared, which I appreciated. There aren't a whole lot of ways to mess up a martini but there are many ways to make one better by personalization. And he did. My friend and I shared the white bean hummus and a chopped salad. Both amazing! And it wasn't a problem when we asked for share plates, more bread, or fresh ground pepper. The prices weren't cheap but the portions were hefty and everything was very very tasty. Don was on his game. Also a pleasant guy to chat with. It's uncomfortable when bartenders never speak a word to you - We know you can hear our entire conversation so please don't pretend otherwise. Conversely I dislike when bartenders talk too much - as nice as we're all being to each other, you aren't the person I came to have a drink with. Don had the right balance of friendly attentiveness. He also seemed experienced and to genuinely like his job. Whether that's actually the case doesn't make a difference. There's nothing worse than trying to go out for a fun meal and feeling like you're one more burden for a disgruntled server. Thanks Don!  We'll be back!"
