Todd B.,"Olivehurst, CA",0,73,,3.0,9/7/2017,"So, my reviews always start out with 5 stars and I take one star away for every negative I experience. On the positive side, the food was good. It is the same as every Cheesecake Factory so you can expect some consistency there. But really, does anyone go there for the food or the cheesecake? You go for a bite to eat and a piece or cheesecake right. My cheesecake of choice? The Dulce de Leche cheesecake. Hands down. There were specials there as well like the double chocolate something and birthday cake cheesecakes but my favorite will always be what I order. The waiter was polite. The hostess greeted us and sat us as soon as they could. So, yah. I would recommend this Cheesecake Factory and will probably go there again.  Why the loss of 2 stars then since I liked it so much? Hands down the prices are way too high. My wife and I got 2 chicken plates, 2 ice teas and 2 pieces of cheesecake. $100. $3.50 for an ice tea that we had a hard time getting refilled. So the prices have gotten a little out of touch. Maybe next time we will eat before and just go there for the desert. My second star was removed for a combination of factors. First the restaurant was busy so we had to wait for a couple minutes. No big deal and no star removed for that. But when we were sat we got the tiny table in the back corner that always seems to be forgotten about. So as we waited at this tiny table we were overlooked by our server a couple times. I would have waited another 10-15 minutes just for a real table. Anyway, not too shabby. Just next time we will maybe share a dinner and get our cheesecake."

Tina T.,"Elk Grove, CA",40,4,2,1.0,9/21/2017,"I love their cheesecakes, but horrible service. This review is for their bakery only. Last year, I ordered a cheesecake for my fiancée 24 hours before pick up and when I got there, my order was not written down. Luckily, they had a 10 inch in the back and charged me for the 7 inch (what I ordered). Today, I ordered a 7 inch for my little brother and when I got there, once again, they said it was not written down. On top of that, they only had 6 slices, so my little brother had half a cake for his birthday. He loves cheesecakes. How sad!! They didn't even apologize. Why don't the employees write down orders??? It shouldn't take long right?? I don't get it. 1 star because they have good cheesecake."
Ashi C.,"Elk Grove, CA",138,731,1430,4.0,3/2/2017,I like the cheesecakes. They are a little pricey but they taste delicious. There is always a long line at the cheesecake factory.
Vince L.,"Sacramento, CA",229,605,158,4.0,7/5/2017,I came to try the THAI COCONUT-LIME CHICKEN. It did not disappoint. It was absolutely delicious. The curry was mild and you definitely taste the coconut milk. I also really liked the shiitakes in it. The only thing that I thought was a bit odd was that they didn't peel the stem portion off the snow peas. Kinda odd but you couldn't eat it. The portions were large and The service was great. I also got there early enough to get a Mojito during happy hour. It was a little sweeter than I care for and you really can't taste the alcohol. I don't normally come here because there is typically a wait. But i'd come back for the curry!
Rafa G.,"West Sacramento, CA",9,3,,2.0,11/26/2017,"Hi there I'm a little disappointed of this place.We went last night for Dinner and I order the Chicken parmesan and after a while the waitress came and told me there's no more,And then I ordered a Red Sangria and guess what...the waitress said there's no more   that can happen in one of the more ""Famous""Restaurants."
Jason H.,"Hayward, CA",4,269,198,3.0,8/19/2017,"Cheesecake Factory is a okay place to come. It is overpriced for decent food. Dishes are $15 plus and for the taste and quality I don't believe it is worth it at all.  I ordered the Mac and cheese bites but guess what they were out! Thanks, I've always wanted my dreams crushed during the first 5 minutes of my date. Ordered the cheese dip which was good but not $9 good. The only salvageable food this place has to offer is obviously the desserts and even then they run for about $8 or $9 a slice!!!!! That is way too much for a single slice of cheesecake. If you have money to throw away or waste, come here. The best cheesecakes are cookie dough, red velvet, Oreo dream cheesecake, chocolate cheesecake, pumpkin cheesecake. If you really want cheesecake, it's better to eat and then come here for dessert, that way you only spend a fraction of the price."
cyndi c.,"Acampo, CA",129,3,,1.0,11/14/2017,"Worst service that I have had in ages. After ordering, it took 30 minutes to find out they were out of a menu item that two of us ordered. After changing order, food took another hour. Profuse apology by waitress, but no visit by manager or offer or any type of compensation on a $260 tab for 6 people. Food was mediocre. Drinks and desserts were delicious. We drove an hour to dine there...other than the company, a total waste of over 4 hours of life."
Cynthia K.,"Sacramento, CA",52,75,131,4.0,8/13/2017,"I always enjoy coming here! The fried calamari was good . I always order the jambalaya over pasta , instead of pasta I asked for it over rice . I also like the shrimp over angel hair pasta . My favorite dessert is the banana cream cheesecake!"
Ferris N.,"Carmichael, CA",55,112,260,4.0,7/27/2017,"I've eaten at this restaurants many times. Many times. One time I even met the honorable Mayer Kevin Johnston as he was eating lunch with his staff! This is a very good restaurant that consistently serves decent food. The service could at times be a little slow but it's understandable because the place gets very busy especially at lunch time. Today, we had lunch here. As expected, it was very busy. But we were given a table right away. Our server, her name was Sonia. She was very nice but I could tell she was very busy and at times perhaps even overwhelmed. But she managed very well. She took care of us ok and I was pleased with her service and attention. She brought us their signature bread and butter. The dark brown sweet bread is just to die for! Our food came shortly after. I ordered the shrimp with angel hair pasta. It was very good. For desert we ordered the Linda chocolate cake. Trust me - you can't go wrong with that! Over all, we had a good experience. We will be back!"
B M.,"Sacramento, CA",0,61,27,4.0,9/9/2017,"Whether its for the meals or just the dessert, this place is good! Very high prices and generally very busy, but is indeed good food."
Mark C.,"Sacramento, CA",19,3,1,2.0,9/6/2017,Poor service.  Made us wait 45 min while there was ample unoccupied tables. Food was good.  Drinks too took a long long time to come. It was just 2 beers.
Darin W.,"Modesto, CA",0,6,,5.0,11/16/2017,An extensive menu is an understatement.  The food and service are always high quality.  I appreciate the fact that you can choose healthy or decadent options based on the occasion.
Katherine C.,"Elk Grove, CA",3,10,1,2.0,10/26/2017,"Our waiter is terrible. We've been here an hour and a half. Service was slow, slow, slow. I would consider blaming the kitchen but the waiter's attitude is rude. He ignored us after he brought the food. I sat with my finished plate for a long time. We ordered a piece of cheesecake and it was delivered like a drive by shooting. He didn't even stop or look at us. After waiting again for the check, he practically threw it at my husband. I worked all day, and I expect people to do their job, too. I didn't need this crappy service."
Brittania P.,"Fairfield, CA",127,4,,1.0,10/31/2017,Probably will never come back services very slow and the guy server  was kinda rude and took over 15 minuets for a draft beer
Terryann T.,"Sacramento, CA",38,71,70,5.0,6/29/2016,"We came here on a Tuesday right after lunch and it was crazy packed! I guess because it is one of the better restaurants by the mall. There was a 15 minute wait but it didn't feel that long.  I ordered the combo Steak Diane/Chicken Madeira, which came with mushrooms, asparagus and mash potatoes. My mother got the Philly Cheesesteak and my dad got the Hibachi Steak. My food was so delicious and cooked perfectly, there was way too much mashed potatoes but they were better than expected. I had mushrooms with both of my dishes so that was great. My dads said said his steak was great as well but again too much mashed potatoes.  The only bad part of the meal was that my mother did not like her cheesesteak, the meat was kind of tough and the bread was as well. I think it was the same type of sourdough that was brought out when we sat down.  We were so full from lunch that we didn't even have room for the cheese cake, oh well, maybe next time!  So overall, a great experience, they have something for everyone, and the service is super. We will definitely be back!"
Mackenzie L.,"Modesto, CA",203,19,25,4.0,8/19/2017,"The service was good, presentation of the food was wonderful, and the atmosphere is always nice at the Cheesecake Factory. We were seated within five minutes and greeted shortly after. I ordered a Blue Moon along with my Spicy Chipotle Chicken Pasta. The pasta was good but a little bit too much sauce for my personal liking. It was also topped with what seemed like a million crunchy onion straws. I picked most of them off because it just took over the pasta. For dessert I ordered the Coffee & Cream Chocolate Supreme cheesecake which was delicious. I will definitely be back next time I'm in the area but will probably try something different from the menu."
A M.,"Carmichael, CA",0,20,25,4.0,11/5/2017,"To me everything was nice , my first time experience I can tell is above average, yes busy , yes noise, yes good and delicious menu, I'm coming back definitely!!"
Usman M.,"Sacramento, CA",77,69,1,3.0,9/7/2017,Pasta sauce wasn't too rich in flavor and was a little watery. Not what I would expect . Cheesecake though was 5/5
Kelly L.,"Yuba City, CA",55,146,4,2.0,6/20/2017,"Way overpriced, although they have huge, greasy portions. Nothing special about the food, and their menu is daunting.  Our server was sweet, and it was so packed and loud we could hardly hear each other across our small table. The drinks were weak, but that wasn't her fault. I don't know how someone could eat here more than once."
