Nando V.,"Sacramento, CA",408,401,2360,2.0,8/15/2015,"I went here last night and wasn't thrilled bout nothing, its noisy its dark its slow did i mention its dark as fuck? Man i ordered the tuscan chicken i cut into it then i realized ""i cant even see if this shit is bloody cuz its to damn dark in this bitch"" man smh just that thought alone killed my vibe. I ate half of my chicken breast then i quit cuz i thought it might be bloody. Other than that our waitress was koo as hell. The kitchen must of been slow cuz we waited for like 30 minutes. Sorry i didn't take a pic of my food i thought it was to dark to even get a pic!! It felt like i was eating in the closet or some shit. Over all i really wasn't feeling the factory and I'm pretty sure i wont be back, the cheese cake was alright but then again is cheesecake. I honestly wouldn't recommend this place to my wort enemy but then again we are all strangers here so what the hell go give this place a try lol"
Sam S.,"Sacramento, CA",5,132,10,4.0,4/25/2015,This place is pretty good. I've always had good service and enjoy the food. The beer selection could be bigger. I'm disappointed they no longer serve the Navajo sandwich. That was my favorite. T_T
Nishaant R.,"Elk Grove, CA",93,8,6,5.0,3/25/2015,"Excellent food (myriad of options) and excellent service. What more can a customer ask for? Oh yea, a ton of cheesecake options!"
Sunny G.,"Fremont, CA",34,104,6,4.0,5/14/2013,"398 reviews before my review. Do you have time to read for all of them? I guess not ;) Now two cases here and trying to be compact as time is precious :) A) If you already been to 'the cheesecake factory' then           -You know what to expect nice long wait..use smartphone or spend quality time with date girl or watch out..Its good to look around :)           - Now coming back to service, man its your luck. You will not sure which server you will hit upon. I rather find them professional and nice unless they having terrible bad day :) Be considerate and take it easy :) B) New comer    - Yes man(women) all the buzz is really worth it. You taking for a date or special occasion, this experiment wont fall on your face. They have plenty of sweet options and lots of people around.  Go for it. They have huge portions and not too super expensive. Some spots just try to pretend trendy and rob your pocket. This one is at least safer bet :)"
Diana T.,"Fairfield, CA",50,78,19,4.0,2/13/2014,"We were hungry, and we needed to eat. We've been wanting to try this place out, so why not on a weekday, when it's not so packed?  Surprisingly, everything was great. I enjoyed it so much, I'll be coming back again and again.  Unfortunately, we were so stuffed we didn't have a slice of cheesecake. When we got home, we regretted not taking one to go, to enjoy later.  Until next time, Cheesecake Factory, until next time...."
Mark L.,"Portland, OR",226,96,15,5.0,6/20/2013,"Two words: Chicken Bellagio ...okay, three more words: is freakin' amazing. I've been to Cheesecake Factory stores up and down California, and had a consistently pleasant experience, but it wasn't 5-star until I discovered and tried this incredible dish. ""Crispy Coated Chicken Breast over Basil Pasta and Parmesan Cream Sauce Topped with Prosciutto and Arugula Salad."" ... and it tastes even better than it sounds, if you can believe that. Along my journey of discovery, I don't think I had anything I didn't like. A few standouts: - Fried Macaroni and Cheese - You can't go wrong frying mac n' cheese - Four Cheese Pasta - In case the name doesn't sink in, avoid if you don't like cheese; otherwise it's awesome - Monte Cristo - Delicious, but super rich, so plan on sharing, or taking half or more home However, I've certainly had several dishes that I wouldn't order again. Here's the quick list: - Cajun Chicken ""Littles"" - Chicken fingers on par with what'd you'd get at the fair - Orange Chicken - Stick with Panda Express or Trader Joe's for your Orange Chicken - Bang - Bang Chicken and Shrimp - This one is my fault, as I'm not wild about coconut, and this dish was bathed in the stuff And then of course, there's the cheesecake. Good gracious... I've had so many different ones, and they're all so good, none of them really stand out. When it's time to order dessert, just close your eyes and point, you won't be disappointed. Portions are crazy, so come hungry, or ready to share, or clear some room in your fridge for leftovers. I usually enjoy the second half of my dish the next day for lunch,.along with some of the fantastic molasses bread. Sure, it's crowded, and that critique has applied to all 8+ locations I've been to, so just plan for a wait time or go during off-peak hours. At this location at Arden, we've gotten here by 5:30 on a Friday and only waited a couple minutes. Oh, and I've never had a bad service experience, at least that I remember. Everybody always seems really chipper. Almost eerily so."
Ernest L.,"Sacramento, CA",34,2,1,5.0,6/30/2015,This location has been my go to place whenever im not sure what i feel like eating. Have been going constantly for about 3 years now and can't say I've had a single day where I wasn't satisfy with the food and service. Place is a little dark so you might find yourself reaching for a flashlight to look at the menu...but it's nice for date nights. Staff is friendly and attentive to your needs. Definitely recommend!
Angelica I.,"Fullerton, CA",0,6,,2.0,8/29/2016,"I'm in town with my boyfriend & we decided to come here for our anniversary. We were seated fairly fast considering it was a Monday night. I had ordered the Pasta Carbonara while my partner had the Chipotle Pasta. My food was very delicious and the only reason I'm even considering giving stars to this location. The Chipotle Pasta was debatable. We thought that maybe putting more Parmesan Cheese would make the taste settle down a little. We both raised our hands when a server had turned and she looked at us and completely walked away. We waited for our original server, Marie and after waiting finally got her attention and requested for cheese. She aggravatedly shredded the cheese toppling over on the table and on my partner. She quickly turned around. My partner & I looked at each other out of awe from how rude she was. On top of all this the knife had a green stain on it. I've been to other Cheesecake Factory locations but this one really disappointed me."
tee v.,"Santa Maria, CA",3,7,1,1.0,12/16/2014,1 star for the waiter who was really nice but otherwise I do not plan on returning. Me an a friend came and I had a strawberry lemonade... Well i will just stop there because I don't know what the hell they put in that because it made me SICK! Not the taste it must have been loaded with sugar or something because I could barely concentrate after drinking it and I have never ever had such a problem before! With that being said I had to get my food to go and It was ehhh and I had also ordered a side of Mac and cheese that was flavorless and the grease actually burned a whole in my container. However the banana cheesecake is delicious! I kinda always thought that this place was sorta gourmet but now I know that it's NOT! I think they should stick to just making cheesecakes.
Mark W.,"Sacramento, CA",5,29,,5.0,5/29/2013,"I just love Cheesecake Factory.  They make so many different types of food, that its hard to believe they can do them well.  But the fact is that I've ordered a bunch of different meals, appetizers, and drinks, and they are always really good. My wife and I have gone there several times over the last few months and the experience has been consistently good.  Here are some of my favorite dishes: Vietnamese Tacos - these are tiny, but tasty.  You could argue its not a very good value, but oh my God, they are so delicious!  The soft taco ""shell"" is like a bao bun, and just a little sweet.  The filling is sweet, tangy, spicy, and delicious. Beef Skinnylicious Soft Tacos - how are these under 800 calories? They are beef soft tacos, topped with avocado salsa.  The shells are corn - not steamed corn or fried corn, but lightly grilled maybe? They are some of the best tacos I've ever had, and I've eaten a lot of tacos. Skinny Tuscan chicken - again, how is this on the skinny menu? The portion was huge; more than I could eat, and it all tasted amazing. Chicken Bellagio - olive oil, pesto, Parmesan chicken, angel hair pasta.  Amazing. Oh, dessert.  Yah, I haven't even tried ether cheesecake in a long time. I know it's awesome but I never have room.  The hardest part about cheesecake is deciding which one to try.   I have never had a bad or even mediocre experience at Cheesecake Factory.  I look forward to going back again and again."
Linda D.,"San Diego, CA",3,15,,2.0,4/1/2016,"I go to Cheesecake Factory fairly often. This was not a good experience and was not typical of this chain. They don't take reservations and we had a party of eight so there was an expected wait. However, the ""hostess"" was not forthcoming with the time we were to wait. She told me it would be 30 min to 40 minutes. When 40 minutes came and went, I went up to check with her. Rather than apologize for the extended wait, she informed me In a surly tone that we had ""only waited  44 minutes"". I consider this rude and, not in any sense, good customer service. She should have apologized for the extended wait and assured me that we would be seated shortly. NOT IMPRESSIVE and I will not be returning to that restaurant nor the chain any time soon. Once we were seated, the server was adequate but did get part of our order screwed up."
Andrew N.,"Austin, TX",38,165,1381,4.0,12/29/2013,"Went here today with a friend. I ordered the fish and chips (they were very good and not too greasy like some other places). She ordered a veggie burger and liked it. We shared a slice of Oreo cheesecake and we were very happy. The bill wasn't cheap, but it's nice to eat too much (portions are huge) and then shove some cheesecake down your throat and then walk around Arden Fair Mall. The bread was warm, fresh, and we didn't even have to ask for it (unlike the multiple times I went to Cheesecake factory in Boulder). Oh and the outside heaters being on in December is really nice (ahem Dad's Kitchen in Fair Oaks)."
Sandy R.,"Tampa, FL",7,17,3,1.0,2/18/2015,"Server was inattentive to our needs. Forgot ranch for salad, bread was delivered with our main course, refills were not provided. When refills were provided, server did not know our drink. Server did not offer cheese for pasta or pepper for salad. Server mumbled you must think I'm so terrible. Service was very sub par. Restaurant was not very busy at this time of dining either. Server was brandon. Came in at 10pm on a Wednesday night."
John T.,"Napa, CA",2,41,,4.0,2/18/2015,We love this place the menu has so much to choose from and the portions are good size.Serves was great and pricing was fair.Pulling up to the front and using valet parking was well worth it.We will be back!
Trevor R.,"Citrus Heights, CA",1,5,,5.0,4/7/2015,"Absolutely love the cheesecake factory in Sacramento, it was a small mix up with my food.

Despite a busy night, the waiters were all really prompt and courteous!  The food came out quickly and, although our nachos were cold, our waiter quickly replaced it with a fresh batch with melted cheese.  Yum!! We also ordered the calamari and garlic chicken farfalle and added asparagus (definitely recommended).  Their nachos are huuuuge but they're not that great.  Everything else was  . Finally, we ended with the best part: dessert!!  Strawberry shortcake and dulce de leche to die for!  I believe it's a consensus that Cheesecake Factory serves the best dessert of all chain restaurants..it's no wonder we chose it for Valentine's Day!"
Nelle E.,"Roseville, CA",0,9,24,1.0,11/14/2015,Worst veggie burger I ever had! So disappointed! The burger patty was mush and fell apart. The bun didn't taste fresh!

Sally C.,"San Francisco, CA",619,339,91,4.0,12/19/2011,"A lot of my friends groaned when I chose to celebrate my 21st birthday at the Cheesecake Factory. BUT we had a great time.  Our waitress was really awesome. She made me feel really special and always asked me how I liked my food or drink and served me first before everyone else.  Came here on a Friday night with about 10 or so of my friends- we were seated outside with some nice heat lamps which she turned up for us. The hungry boys also went through about like a million bread baskets. Our faves was the brown rye bread which we just called 'the brown bread'... so we would ask her, 'Can you bring us like 5 baskets of only brown bread please?' Yes, hard to believe we are in college. She was constantly bringing us bread and did so with a smile on her face, which we really appreciated. She also laughed along with our weird conversations, haha. Ordered our food- girls got pastas and fish dishes, most of the guys got jambalaya or burgers. Everyone enjoyed the food. The waitress actually went through each drink with me to make sure I would like the one I chose. I ended up ordering the sour green apple martini. Not bad, but I liked the mango cooler someone else got.  We all had a great time and finished off the night with a bunch of cheesecakes. I must say, the cheesecakes here are sooo overpriced but so deliciously made at the same time.  Food here isn't cheap and we waited over an hour for our table, but the experience was good. Thumbs up for our wonderful waitress! Exceptional customer service."
