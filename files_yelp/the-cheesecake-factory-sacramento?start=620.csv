Sue O.,"Sacramento, CA",4,11,1,1.0,3/8/2016,"I usually love this place but my last visit really left me disappointed !! I bragged to my spouse that the fish and chips was great !! Nice large pieces with a nice batter coating !! Should have taken a picture they were over cooked,dry, and very thin pieces of fish ??? What happen ? Bad batch of fish ?? You guys really need to look into that !! Now I'm turned off from a restaurant i loved !! They did take one dinner off bill and re-made me a couple pieces but it was NOT the quality of fish I'd had in the past !!"
shaunta r.,"Sacramento, CA",208,13,1,4.0,3/28/2016,Long waits long menu. I would ask to review one as you wait so you dont have to spend too much time going over a huge book at the table. Its nothing really to write home about unless you are just there for the cheesecake. Lots of choose from.
Ivy R.,"Martinez, CA",137,1779,4674,3.0,1/27/2009,This is the second Cheesecake Factory I have been to. This trip was more disappointing. I ordered the Navajo Sandwich or something like that. I wanted to try their version of Navajo Fry Bread. Boy was I disappointed. The chicken was good in it and it had avocado. But I kind of knew in the back of my head that it could never live up to actual Fry Bread you would get up on the White River Reservation in Northern Arizona.  I did not eat cheesecake. I just couldn't do it. Even though I really wanted to. To many calories.  This one isn't as busy as the Pleasanton location.
Scott P.,"Fresno, CA",77,35,15,5.0,2/24/2015,Food is always good! We found out on Friday the buffalo wings are awesome! Crunchy on the outside...warm and chewy on the inside. Just the right amount of buffalo sauce.
Christine H.,"Sacramento, CA",284,230,4,5.0,2/8/2013,"Everything is DELICIOUS!  I don't think I've ever had a bad item here.  Anywhere from a the simple Grill cheese sandwich (not on the menu)  to the Steak Diane...  It's all amazing.  Some favorites of mine are the The Navajo, Farfalle w/chicken & roasted garlic, Crusted chicken romano, Chicken Madeira, Chinese Chicken Salad and the  Miso Salmon.  The last time I was here the waiter was outstanding.  He suggested I try the Bellagio Chicken (w/arugula & pancetta) but ask for the chicken in the Louisiana chicken pasta.  WOW was he spot on!!  When it comes out it looks overwhelming but it the taste is heaven.  You have to make sure every bit has a bit of the chicken, arugula and pancetta in it!   I also like to order my Eggs benedict during their Sunday brunch.  I love breakfast food.  I just recently tried their Sunrise Fiesta Burrito.  This is not just an ordinary burrito.  So tasty and it has chicken chorizo.   But last but not least you cannot leave without having dessert, cheesecake at that!  I like the white chocolate caramel macadamia nut but my favorite is still the Godiva chocolate cheesecake.   If your not into cheesecake the Black out cake is also a great choice.  Or if you would like to drink your dessert the Strawberry Creamsicle is delish!   Not much more to say except that portion size is huge, staff is awesome and it's time to EAT some YUMMY food!"
Melissa B.,"Davis, CA",40,108,34,5.0,2/19/2013,"Love Cheesecake Factory. Not only is their menu HUGE, everything I have ever ordered from here is delicious and I can never finish the large portions. Their bread is amazing and we like to order extra for the table to take home with our leftovers! I love getting a burger here, they have many varieties and they are so good.  One time when we were here, we were not waiting an unusually long time for the food, but the manager came over and told us that they forgot to cook my burger and that it would be out in a minute and they would give us a complimentary dessert. It literally arrived as she was leaving, and like I said we werent even questioning when our food was going to come out yet. Then, at the end of the meal when we were paying, they gave us a survey code to go online and rate the service and we got a $10 coupon!! Not sure if this was a random survey or not, but I've gotten it one more time since then, and they are valid for several months afterward.  Great place to bring a date ;) If you have a large party, try to call in a reservation, or prepare to wait. If you dont mind sitting outside during winter, they can usually seat you right away. Prices are reasonable for the size and quality of the food, parking at this location is not great since it is near a mall and movie theater, but I havent had the problem of not being able to find a spot. And of course... THE CHEESECAKE IS DELICIOUS!"
Christopher L.,"Arden-Arcade, CA",3,2,,1.0,3/15/2015,"It's dark for starters it hard to even read the menu,it's freezing cold so bring a sweater or a jacket 20 mph cool breeze ever couple min, the waiting staff sucks barely ever come around to ur table an food an portions really aren't that great or worth the money just plain crappy place in general!!! Would never recommend this place to anyone for anything on the menu just don't even go here!!!!!!"
Amanda N.,"Portola, CA",88,142,36,4.0,2/14/2015,"You always know what you're getting here, good food in a noisy and busy setting. Our food came out fast and our waiter, Tim, at bar was good."
Cindy L.,"Sacramento, CA",112,50,166,5.0,12/6/2011,"This place never disappoints.  I love dessert, and this place is best for all kinds of cheesecake (of course)!  Their entrees are good also.  Service is great. I love cheesecake :)."
Aileen L.,"Suisun City, CA",2,5,,1.0,1/19/2013,"Extremely rude/poor service from a server named Celia.  1) Needed to ask for bread 15 minutes after being seated 2) Brought out soggy pizza (which I understand wasn't HER fault) but giving US a shitty look about it and acting as if we're the inconvenience is not okay.  3) Brought out bread with carpet lint in it, seriously? Then acted as if that was no big deal.  What a coincidence the only moment she seemed personable & apologized was when the check was brought to us and it was time to tip her."
Anne F.,"Sacramento, CA",2,35,,2.0,7/22/2014,"Expensive for ordinary food.  The only thing that this place has is lots of unhealthy ingredients.  Read some of the nutritional info on this food and you will be shocked at the amount of fat, sugar and salt.  It is easy to see why we have so much obesity and disease."
Tori L.,"Spokane, WA",3,25,,4.0,3/9/2015,"Always good food, not the best for the price, but it's the ambiance that ups it. Cheesecake is to die for though! The waitstaff can be hit or miss, and it is always just a little too dark."
Steve M.,"Sacramento, CA",154,241,6,3.0,11/6/2013,"We received a great gift from my brother of a dinner and a movie.  The dinner was for The Cheesecake Factory, so off we went.  We were both very pleased with our meal, first the menu is just as huge as I remember, so many things to choose from is one of the biggest challenges you will face here.  Ultimately, I decided on a Chile Relleno burger (something I have never even considered before), and my wife had the fish tacos.  We also had a couple of small plate appetizers consisting of the Bang Shrimp  and the fried polenta sticks.   The bang shrimp was GREAT (highlight of the night) and the dipping sauce was excellent too.  The Polenta sticks were good - but different.  They reminded me of a limp mozzarella cheese stick.  When our entree's arrived we were half full form the small plates but were ready to go.  My wife's tacos were good, and with four tacos, she only finished half.  I loved her beans and rice but she didn't care for the rice as it had a lot of Cilantro (not her fav but one of mine).  My Chile Relleno burger was interesting.  The Chile Relleno gave it a slightly odd texture, but the taste and flavor was good.  Cooked to a perfect medium well just like I ordered. We had good service considering it was a busy Friday night.  We would go back again, but probably only with a gift card or coupon - there are many more places we have never been that we are anxious to explore."
Discretio ..,"Redwood City, CA",32,630,28,1.0,11/3/2014,"This is what I detest about American dining. Generic chain dining that is ""fancied up"" to impress the person who doesn't really have much in the way of standards.  Everything was overly salty and greasy. And served in whopping gigantic portions. No wonder nearly every entrée is over 800 calories. Even the cheesecake, which I would expect to be out of this world here, was mediocre. I get better at Ricks in midtown.  You can barely hear your fellow dining companions because the venue is large and impersonal. Yet people flock to this place in hoardes. If you prefer to support smaller venues with quality foods and a touch of ambiance, look elsewhere. This is essentially a dressed up Chilis, Dennys, or Olive Garden."
Rob L.,"Sacramento, CA",10,3,2,1.0,10/10/2014,Coming into the restaurant we we nice to open a door for a lady coming in. Then we let the lady go ahead of us to be nice. She checked in an within a few minutes was taken to a table at this time I was yet to be acknowledged by the hostess. After awhile of standing there he finally allowed me to check in so I walked off to the side. A few minutes later 3 older ladies came in and was seated still at this time have not been seated when asked why they took the ladies before us he gave a attitude and said they wet seating is next. Finally sitting down the waitress did not seam to be coming checking on us after we ordered drinks. Finally when we ordered the runner came out to gives some else's order. They fixed but took awhile to get our order. While we were eating the runner came back us with a salad which again was not our order.
Tina M.,"Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, NY",0,1,,4.0,10/6/2014,"Had Sunday night dinner with a party of 15 people. The wait time was 35 minutes, pretty long wait overall to accommodate our big group. However, the servers were extremely friendly and knowledgeable. They kept us posted on the wait time. Cheesecake Factory!! please implement reservation service in the near future. The food was excellent. I usually order their Bistro Shrimp pasta or Cheesecake factory's meatloaf entree. This time, I tried something new -  the Thai lettuce wraps which were very tasty. It came in three different dipping sauces. -the dulce de luce cheesecake was perfect in favor too. I would order these items again..Highly recommended place to hang with family/friends"
Kaycie L.,"Sacramento, CA",19,443,1357,4.0,1/30/2011,"Large portions... check... Large selections... check... Large bill.. check! Lols!!! It's a nice ambience and the food is fairly good. The people are kind and the service is cool! It's definitely tough to walk away without a slice of some sort of cheesecake. Btw, I like the wheat bread... yummy!!! Oh, the wait can be long so try going before or after the crowd."
Matthew L.,"North Highlands, CA",54,7,,1.0,5/12/2015,"Terrible service! Don't come here with a group over 6, probably. They just can't properly accommodate large diner party's. No sense of time management between waitresses and cooks. Let's just say by I reviewed my food, I had to just tell em to fix it to go. This is a sit in and dine restaurant, no?  Waitress was very unapologetic about the while situation. Would definitely recommend the establishment in Rosevile. All around better atmosphere if you know what I mean. Seems like the employees just don't value there work. Sad really!"
Derrell A.,"Vacaville, CA",11,23,115,5.0,1/31/2015,"Took my Wife and son here earlier (430-5ish)this evening for her Birthday dinner . We had our table in tens minutes on a Saturday (that never happens) lol. Had a nice greeter and our waitress was awesome she took care of us the entire time just great service . Her shift ended and her relief( Kristina)  was awesome as well . If you eat here I recommend the fried cheese w/ marinara for appetizers super tasty.  I also recommend the passion fruit margarita . We use both decided to get sandwiches this time around. She had the crispy chicken sandwich with buffalo sauce ,ranch , and fries . I had the smokehouse bbq burger with sweet potato fries. Our son had the kids chicken strips and fries all were really good. If this is too plan Jane I recommend the half chicken and lemon and mashed potatoes aka my usual or the chicken fettuccine   Pasta dish her usual. We finished the night off with our designated hitter toasted marshmallow cheesecake aka the smore cheesecake and a new fav lemon raspberry cheesecake . Over all this whole experience was a ""GOOD LOOK"" . They even sang Happy Birthday to my wife and lite her candles Twice . My Son blew out the first round lol."
Mike R.,"Sacramento, CA",64,11,5,4.0,1/25/2015,"Went here earlier this month to kill some time before seeing a movie and had a wonderful experience. Our server, Antoinette was very personable and helped us with all of our choices for the evening. The only reason I didn't give this place a 5 was that it was just a bit too dark. I understand that it's mood lighting and that there are other reasons, but still. It was dark out and almost just as dark in there : P"
