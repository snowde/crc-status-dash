Sarah U.,"San Luis Obispo, CA",37,105,127,5.0,4/29/2013,"Luis was my waiter. Great service. Started with the sweet corn cakes, BOMB! Got the Hibachi steak with the recommendation from the waiter, didn't disappoint! Great cosmos! Took a rich super dark chocolate cake slice to go. Wow. Diabetic coma."
Monica F.,"West Sacramento, CA",43,32,,4.0,2/14/2015,"You can't really ever go wrong with Cheesecake Factory. The menu is extensive, and everything is quite delicious. Service is always superb. They really pay attention to your needs, have your water refilled just as soon as it is emptied, and bread, drinks and meals come out promptly even though they are crowded most of the time. Get the Godiva chocolate cheesecake! You won't regret it."
Dan L.,"Carmichael, CA",91,3,,3.0,10/15/2014,"It's a nice place, my friend celebrates her birthday dinner here every year.  The servers are great, however they could use some new chairs because I keep sliding off.  It's un comfortable to have to make an effort to hold yourself up on the chair for a long period of time"
Loki N.,"Sacramento, CA",2,115,,2.0,8/13/2016,"Had lunch the other day with girlfriend. Had been a long time since I ate at one and desserts looked SO tempting. Played it safe and ordered a hot tea with lunch special of soup, salad and half a turkey sandwich. Soup was baked potato and it was delicious, having been sprinkled with crumbled bacon bits, green onions and drizzle of sour cream. Made a perfect match when dipping bread from their breadbasket into it. Loved every single drop! The salad turned out to a disappointment. Mixed greens with maybe, MAYBE a tsp of blue cheese dressing tossed with it. At least the greens were fresh but there was nothing added to it. Not abit of cheese, even croutons, nothing! Just greens with the measly tsp of dressing on it... The sandwich was some fresh sliced turkey on a roll with tomato and lettuce. The turkey was fresh and tasty but that was about it. My friend ordered the same thing and said it was only ok. We split a slice of the Kahlua chocolate cheesecake and that was wonderfully rich and sinful! Our server was okay at first but once we got our food, she was nonexistent! We had to ask for a refill of my hot water from someone else and we never got a refill on our ice water. We had to ask for a takeout box and we felt rushed and like we didn't exist. Ok I get you are busy and want to turn your table but rudeness shouldn't be rewarded tip wise. I really wanted to say some great things about it but this place sadly isn't much more than an overpriced Denny's. Lots of people seemed happy to be there so good for them, I'm happy for you, but I give one star for the soup and Kahlua cheesecake and one star for the fact a lot of people were happily celebrating special events. However, poor waitress service won't have me returning nor will I recommend it to others. Take your dining dollars and find somewhere else or get it to go if their food is your thing. Sorry folks.... PROS: Delish baked potato soup and chocolate Kahlua cheesecake. CONS: Poor waitress service soured the majority of our visit and lackluster overly priced food made this a Failure of the day for us. I had read Yelp reviews before I went but decided to give them a chance. Sadly, I won't be back..."
Richard M.,"Galt, CA",7,36,15,4.0,4/22/2015,"Great food, great atmosphere and usually great service! A nice place for Sunday breakfast and to take visitors! Cheesecake is amazing! I really haven't tried the bar yet, but I like what I've seen and experienced so far in the 4 times that I've dined here! Very cool place!"
Malikah H.,"Sacramento, CA",186,82,243,3.0,2/26/2013,"Luis, I HATE you! (0_o) I know that MAY be a bit harsh BUT I mean it! Took my frined here for a meal after we left Comedy Sportz on Arden *The BEST $20 date* I digress.....moving on I have NEVER received such bad service in my LIFE! Let me start by saying I have never been a server but do realize such people live off tips therefore I make sure to always leave something even if it's mediocre service, guess how much Luis received on our $57 bill... that's right folks not ONE darn penny! Normally I start to get anxiety about leaving a server nothing but by the end of our evening I kindly told my date, ""I hope you don't think less of me but this guy was SUCH a tool  I can NOT  muster up even a smart tip of a penny of my hard earned money and he agreed 10 fold.  The Pro's of our evening:  The Food and drinks were AWESOME! We order: *Strawberry Cheesecake * Red Velvet Cheesecake **Chicken Samosas *Appetizer Caesar Salad (that was more than enough for two maybe even three people to share) *A Mint Mojito *And a Passion Mojito (SUPER DELICIOUS) All that for $57 bucks NOT BAD AT ALL AND VERY FILLING!  Now lets discuss how Luis put a damper on the evening, the ONLY reason I gave 3 stars was I normally receive GREAT service, my company and the food we ate was great HOWEVER the overall dining experience was definitely dampened by our server.  THE CONS: Our server was an IDIOT and COMPLETELY inattentive to our table! I guess I wouldn't be as irritated if he didn't ensure he checked on the needs of the not one but two birthday table full of of ladies... guess what creeper you're loosing out on this table's tip!  Speaking of birthday, I asked before we even received our menus that they come over and sing happy birthday to my friend and THAT never happened but the perv sure made sure the table of ladies was taken care of with their birthday song. Ugh RUDE! Whats worst. He bought our cheesecake and left for five minutes..... Anyone want to guess what critical piece he left off.... go ahead I'll wait....that's right he FINALLY came back and asked how everything was and if we needed anything um yea dummy, something TO EAT MY $10 cheesecake with! -_- To which he responded oh I'm so sorry! (IDIOT) after which he began reaching over my date and I to clear our half drank cocktails an the rest of my samosas umm WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING BRO!?! 1) I'm not done with my drink and 2) I'm TOTALLY eating my somosa's in the morning BYE BYE! I kindly told him I was still eating THANKS and continued about my evening. After bring the bill and the to go boxes I KID YOU not my date barely got his cheesecake onto the plate and was seconds away from scooping his dollop of whip cream into his box when this tad grabbed his plate by then I was SO frustrated that I spoke up and let him know WHOA still boxing. That action solidified in my mind he was going to get not ONE cent over the bill! Overall food GREAT service HORIBLE"
Guy R.,"Topeka, KS",1,29,7,4.0,2/1/2014,"Always excellent service, menu selection is great and the food quality superb. Our only complaint is not having fresh fruit on the cheesecakes. Instead that horrible glazed fruit is used."
Pia V.,"New York, NY",1795,884,1359,3.0,10/6/2010,"All the Cheesecake Factories I've been to have been the same.  Same decor, same food, same service.  There is always a wait and the food is consistent, which is always a good thing.  This particular location has valet parking, which is sometimes needed with all the traffic from the mall. As stated in all my Cheesecake Factory reviews: I recommend the Jambalaya with pasta and the fresh strawberry cheesecake.  Their appetizers are really good too, I've never gone wrong with any of them yet.  Also, their salad portions are HUGE.  So if you order one side salad ... be prepared to share.  I LOVED LOVED LOVED their Heath bar crunch cheesecake, but when I went back for my most recent visit I learned that it was no longer on the menu! ... WHHHAAAAAATTT?!!!!! (-2 STARS!) D="
Annimai T.,"Sacramento, CA",298,137,540,5.0,12/21/2012,I tried their Red Velvet cheesecake for the first time  Oh.. My.  GOSH!! The best thing in the world.  Not too heavy.. not too sweet.. Just PERFECT!!
Rene L.,"Sacramento, CA",739,431,195,3.0,5/13/2011,"Another night spent at a train wreck dining experience... +1 for Aaron- our server at the bar who suggested a pomegranite mojito when asked which was the best flavored mojito of them all.  fantabulous choice! i don't want to be a bitch and name names, as hopefully she was only having a VERY off night, but our server just couldn't pull it together. -1 for bringing a 16 oz pint of beer when a 22 was ordered -1 for forgetting a beverage when all others were brought to the table -1 for forgetting dressing on the only salad -1 for having to send back my burger not once, but twice?!?!  i apologized profusely cuz i kinda lost it and dropped an F-bomb or 5, but damn it i have this problem eating out ALL the time.  dry bread or no mayo/sauce/dressing means exactly that.  don't try to sub something else!  then she admits she didn't state no mayo when entering the order.  Jesus, Mary, and Joseph... the food wasn't anything to write home about.  same ol processed food at a chain restaurant. +2 for the cheesecakes.  my sugar spikes as i remember the lemon raspberry, tiramisu, red velvet, and chocolate raspberry shared amongst a frustrated group. -1 to top it off the poor girl doesn't bring enough to-go boxes   each mishap on it's own is definitely not a big deal, but put them all together and we have ourselves a laughable dinner.  did i mention there were only 4 of us, and the place wasn't even that busy!!! i'll definitely return for a whole cheesecake ($6.95 for that slice was a joke) but for sure pass on the rest..."
Kristina L.,"New York, NY",967,496,1094,3.0,11/27/2010,"Dim Lights, Window Seats, Back corner, what more can you ask for? Well...my water was full, the bread kept coming and my belly was full! Service: The service was not bad, however since we were in the back, there was not a lot of attend towards us. This could be good or bad, if you want the privacy.  Surprisingly when we went the line was not long at all. 10 min max which is decent from what I remember from before! I remember having to wait 30 min+ sometimes which is a big turn off! Just note that if you plan on going on the weekends expect that long of a wait.  Dish: Bistro shrimp pasta + Cajun jambalaya pasta Lots of spices! many flavors, but could have been more! it looks rich in the sauce however it tasted a  little more bland then it looked =(. I have had this dish before and it did taste much better than the last time I went and I feel in love with the dish then. I guess it really depends on the cook. Cheesecake: This place will always be my favorite go to place for deesseerrrttt!!! especially for the multi flavors of cheesecake!!!! mmMMmmM recommendations: turtle oreo moose traditional strawberry (anything really with chocolate in the cheesecake is good!!)"
Stephanie S.,"Vallejo, CA",25,104,130,4.0,8/16/2013,"I applaud a chain restaurant for delivering consistently good food despite their GINORMOUS menu. My brother had the chicken and biscuits which was outstandingly good. I had the sweet potato fries and the Santorini faro salad. The sweet potato fries were perfectly crispy and salted just right but the salad was my favorite part. It had goat cheese, beets, arugula and perfectly ripe tomatoes on a bed of faro all dressed in the same perfect dressing. I know  I'm going to order that salad for as long as its on the menu.  Just as good as the food was the service. Our waitress Amber was so patient and amazing while we were trying to make up our minds and offered excellent service from the beginning to the end of our meal.  In case I didn't say so: Thank you for the excellent service, Amber."
Sandy N.,"Sacramento, CA",266,876,2178,1.0,11/9/2010,"My turkey burger was not fully cooked!  I'm so glad I didn't get food poisoning. The manager was trying to argue with me that it was ""a little pink"", um hello it was very pink and turkey is suppose to be cooked all the way!   I was so pissed  My meal was comped."
Chris S.,"Sacramento, CA",2,34,32,4.0,3/20/2015,"I usually don't leave reviews for chain restaurants but this will be the exception. I can't say enough about The Cheesecake Factory. The service is good, the menu is huge, and the food always tastes great. I have to say though, I was a bit disappointed today during my visit. Of the many delicious menu items that are served here, there is one entrée in particular that I order just about all of the time. The infamous Grilled Shrimp and Bacon Club Sandwich. This thing is killer. I flipped through the menu today as we sat down for a quick lunch, and I couldn't find the darn thing. So then I asked our server as she was ready to take our order and she gave me the news that I knew I'd be dreading. They no longer serve it. Ouch...heartbreaker. So I guess it's on to the next best thing, their Chicken Madeira. There's not too much to say about it other than the obvious, it's absolutely delicious. Chicken breast draped with cheese and sautéed mushrooms, lounging in a pool of their Madeira wine sauce. It also comes with mashed potatoes and asparagus. What was also cool was that I told our server that my wife and I would be splitting the entrée, so they served it on two separate plates. I know it doesn't sound like a big deal but a lot of restaurants would just bring you an extra plate and have you split it up yourself. If you're a chocolateholic like myself forget the calories and give the Godiva chocolate cheesecake a try and you won't regret it. Overall this place is terrific. From appetizers, to salads, to entrees, to desserts, there's something for everyone here."
Julianna O.,"Yuba City, CA",246,251,20,2.0,8/29/2010,"Overpriced, over-laden in myriad artery-clogging additives (oils, cheeses, cream-based sauces, etc.) and sloppy, slow service make this place totally forgettable. Also, the 15-page menu could stand to be pared down to what few quality items are offered (cheesecake). The only thing sparing this place from one-star doom is the red velvet cheesecake."
Alliver V.,"San Francisco, CA",599,245,104,4.0,5/15/2013,"I like coming here on special occasions. Anniversaries, birthdays, fancy dinners, and etc. They provide great and friendly service. I also like the ambiance. However, the food can get pricey, but you are paying for the experience. The cheesecakes are amazing (duh, the cheesecake factory haha). They provide large food portions on their food and its pretty good. I would admit, parking sucks but its located near the mall. I think its funny that they have a valet section. I'd come back again."
Shy H.,"Sacramento, CA",0,15,7,5.0,7/31/2015,"I live in the green haven area but I often drive all the way to The Cheesecake Factory for a piece of Fresh Strawberry Cheesecake and a meal. I have a 1 year old and getting her out of the carseat to go in, pay, and pick up a meal is really a hassle. Luckily you can order via phone and pick up with their curb side delivery never having to get out of your car. One of my favorite places to eat"
Natalie M.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",2,11,4,1.0,7/30/2014,"I came on the day that they had half off cheesecake and they were horribly understaffed. You would think that they would know that they would be packed and would get extra workers to come in. The food was okay, but not really rememberable in a good way. The lettuce in my salad was not washed and was covered in dirt."
Maureen N.,"Fair Oaks, CA",9,31,3,5.0,1/13/2016,Ahi Tartare and Dynamite Shrimp are excellent. Others had Cuban Sandwiches and are raving about how good they are. Wait is very long but worth it. Service is excellent.
Tooth F.,"Dixon, CA",2,14,3,5.0,9/16/2013,"I visited on 9/1/13 for my birthday. I had never been to a CCF prior to his visit. We had the chicken potstickers and crab wontons as appetizers. They weren't anything spectacular. My dinner plate was Shrimp Scampi and instead of pasta, I ordered mashed potatoes. My dinner plate was HEAVENLY. For dessert I ordered white chocolate Macademia but cheesecake which was divine. Our service was top notch, the building was beautiful and clean!"

You would think that they would know that they would be packed and would get extra workers to come in. The food was okay, but not really rememberable in a good way. The lettuce in my salad was not washed and was covered in dirt."
Maureen N.,"Fair Oaks, United States",9,31,3,5.0,13/1/2016,Ahi Tartare and Dynamite Shrimp are excellent. Others had Cuban Sandwiches and are raving about how good they are. Wait is very long but worth it. Service is excellent.
Tooth F.,"Dixon, United States",2,14,3,5.0,16/9/2013,"I visited on 9/1/13 for my birthday. I had never been to a CCF prior to his visit. We had the chicken potstickers and crab wontons as appetizers. They weren't anything spectacular. My dinner plate was Shrimp Scampi and instead of pasta, I ordered mashed potatoes. My dinner plate was HEAVENLY. For dessert I ordered white chocolate Macademia but cheesecake which was divine. Our service was top notch, the building was beautiful and clean!"
