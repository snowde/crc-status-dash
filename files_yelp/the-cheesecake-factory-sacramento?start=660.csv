Michael A.,"Sacramento, CA",328,20,4,4.0,1/6/2013,Always a pleasant experience here. Enjoyed a favorite: Cajun Jambalaya Pasta  so-soooooo GOOD! Check it out here: 
Alan L.,"Redmond, OR",6,87,,3.0,4/3/2013,"We were traveling through the Sacramento area on Easter Sunday and we found the Cheese Cake Factory. The menu reads like a telephone book. The prices are on the high side but the portions are generous.I had the Chicken Madeira which had a tasty wine sauce with asparagus, mushrooms and 2 large chicken breasts. I subbed broccoli for mash potatoes. Very enjoyable meal. My wife had breakfast for dinner. She was not very hungry. She had scrambled eggs with potatoes and toast. $ 7 bucks seems a bit much for eggs.The meals was good but like I said a little over priced."
Randy E.,"Sacramento, CA",5,24,3,5.0,11/7/2012,"Been here many times but thought I'd leave a review for the service we received. Josh was a BEAST.  Here's how: He took our tables order of about 9 people without ever once writing our orders down.  He knew everything from the top of his head and once he had our orders he went back around to each person and recited the order to the ""T.""  Many of us had orders that were complicated but he handled them with no problem!  Seriously, this guy is legit and really made for a good night. On top of that, he was a very good server and made sure we had everything we needed and checked up on us as needed.  I would definitely come back here and hope that he's my server again."
Matthew James R.,"Arden-Arcade, Sacramento, CA",243,163,5,5.0,6/13/2013,Great lunchtime experience!  We were in and out. Both ordered the Cobb salad.  It was delicious!!! The waitress was very nice and prompt. People watching was great too.
Felecia F.,"Sacramento, CA",82,265,173,5.0,4/12/2013,"Okay, I hate chain restaurants...and I rarely go to them, but I certainly make an exception for The Cheesecake Factory. I have a soft spot for cheesecake and could eat it everyday if I could. And what I like about some of their slices some donate money to various charities. Makes you feel less guilty when you indulge.  I have to say the service here was oddly great. I was in around 6ish on a Friday night. Our server was Alicia and she was great with our service and helping out with the menu. Ask to sit in her section!!! Food: cheesecake is great, I suggest red velvet or if it's fall get the pumpkin cheesecake. So good! I ordered some sort of shrimp pasta which was amazing! Sorry for not remembering the name guys...."
Lee L.,"Sacramento, CA",0,24,,1.0,1/24/2016,This Location is the worst it used to be good but it went downhill I drive the extra miles to get to Roseville there really nice there and there food is always on point.
Sarah B.,"Galt, CA",56,203,61,3.0,3/24/2013,"Why only three stars? Well, here are a few reasons I'm not a huge fan of Cheesecake Factory.  -Their menu. Why is it so big???? I can never decide because the dang thing is 20 pages long, then I forget I'm looking at a menu because I start to think I'm flipping through a magazine with a bunch of advertisements.  -The wait. I swear no matter what time of day or day of the week there is like a MINIMUM 30 minute wait. I don't mind waiting, but at a place so big and place that I don't understand why it's so popular, the wait irritates me. -The service. I have never experienced stellar service here. Not bad service, just not really good service. Sometimes I wonder if the employees are just overwhelmed.  Now it's not all bad at the Cheesecake, their food is good. I don't think I have ever had anything bad there. The food always seems fresh and is well made. And let's not forget the cheesecake. They have the best cheesecake ever! My favorite being the white chocolate raspberry with the chocolate crust.  One last good thing: it's fun to celebrate here with a large group. They can accommodate you (no reservations thought), and they have the food, dessert, and drinks that a big crowd can all agree on."
Jeff K.,"New York, NY",15,11,6,4.0,11/19/2014,"Good service at the bar this evening. Got to watch the Lakers game too, and that's always good!!!"
Manuel F.,"Woodland, CA",0,7,3,5.0,12/20/2014,The cheesecake was great. It was not to sweet it had the perfect balance. Had the red velvet cheesecake and the original highly recommend both !
Brandon L.,"Sacramento, CA",5,23,5,5.0,11/25/2013,"Place isn't that bad.  Kinda nosy, especially at night but all in all, good place to eat.  They have a HUGE menu and greeeeeat cheesecake"
Michael G.,"Salinas, CA",61,2,,2.0,5/29/2016,"5-29-16(TABLE 202 ) arrived around 4:55 and left around 5:30(just in case the manager wants to check the camera).It was our first time going to the cheesecake factory. It was busy but we sat in the bar because there was no wait. The hostess' were very nice. We sat down at our hi top table and after 5 minutes our waiter came to the table. He did not greet us, but went straight to asking us what we wanted to drink. I felt like he was trying to rush us out. He then left, returned with our drinks and some bread. We were not given any utensils, napkins, or plates for the bread. We ordered two appetizers so I was thinking oh maybe he forgot and will bring the plates and utensils with the apps. The apps were brought by some other severs who were nice. Our waiter only came by to refill our drinks and take the menus because we were still deciding on which cheesecake to order. We ordered the cheesecake and he took our menus. He could clearly see that we did not have any plates and we were eating our hot buffalo strips with our hands. We had to use our menus to eat our bread off of. He didn't really help us much. He helped the other tables around us. I looked all around and all of the tables had utensils and plates. He came by for refills and I just asked him for the check and that we will not be taking the cheesecakes after all. When we received the check I got his name so I could write this review and call the restaurant. His name was BRETT M. Other than service being terrible, the food was delicious and the cheesecakes looked great but I never got a chance to try one because of Brett's service."
Alix P.,"Sacramento, CA",231,6,2,5.0,10/8/2015,"Honestly, I was very unhappy with my experience here. We decided to come here for my friend's birthday. The server took 30 minutes to even take our order, food was slow to come out, and the server even ended up bringing me the wrong burger. We asked for ranch and it was never brought to us, so we had to ask again. When we asked for a basket of bread we were brought cold butter. The server didn't even come to check on our table to ask us how things were going. To top it off we let me know it was our friend's birthday, and we had to remind them. When they came to the table she let me know she didn't want a small sundae, but would prefer a cheesecake. The server said that they couldn't possibly do that because it was against policy. How can you not get cheesecake from the cheesecake factory on your birthday?! I won't be going here again, unless under some other circumstances. The burger was definitely not worth 14 dollars..."
Thor S.,"Walnut Creek, CA",7,19,2,3.0,10/30/2012,"Typical Cheesecake factory feel. (Big, shiny, large portions) Lunch menu was good and appropriately priced."
Lisa B.,"Sacramento, CA",0,22,3,1.0,12/5/2015,"Failed service in every way. First of all we handed in our beeper and they never called us and said they forgot our name. We got right in after that but then we got the worst waiter. I ordered a daiquiri with a water and he never brought the water I asked THREE times!!! never ever got one. And to make matters worse I ordered steak Dianne well done and they brought it out extremely rare. It was barely cooked. My boyfriend ordered the same exact thing and his was well done and when the person brought it out to us she even said ""two well done steak Dianne's"" before she sat them down. So the host, waiter, and cook all failed. I didn't get my dinner back until 5 min after my boyfriend was done so I just asked for a to go box. No offered discount. When we are spending $35 a person we deserve better service then that."
Monique C.,"Sacramento, CA",29,25,20,3.0,8/12/2012,"I haven't dined-in at The Cheesecake Factory for years, so this review is mostly to explain how everyone living in, visiting or driving by Arden should really give their Tiramisu cheesecake a try. It's creamy and taste just like Tiramisu without over doing anything. When you order a slice you get a piece big enough to satisfy your cravings and small enough to want a bit more. I'd recommend it if you're even a bit into coffee and not that big of a fan of their overly decadent chocolate or peanut butter type behemoths."
Tina P.,"Sacramento, CA",7,34,20,1.0,8/24/2014,"Worst experience  here with my family.  Thought itll be nice to take my family out here for their first time and I must say this sucks.  Service was horrible.  We ordered our food,  waited for an hour before it got to us.  Between the times we were served with their complimentary bread and water.  I was basically full off of that already.  The manager didn't come to tell us sorry for the wait til about 45mins later.  If they knew it'll take this long they should have let us know a little sooner. On top of that, when the food arrived,  our pasta was under cooked. It was hard and nasty.  Sorry but I don't think I'll be coming here again.  I should have just went to BJ's at the mall."
Salina M.,"Tracy, CA",24,98,38,2.0,8/16/2012,"I wish I got the waitress's name I had last night because she pretty much sucked. I could tell her smile was fake. She gave our table smushed butter. Why can't you throw that out and get more butter? Are you that lazy? The holder that our check was held in was covered with ketchup.  I usually think of Cheesecake Factory's to be rather nice restaurants, but this one was rather ghetto. Ghetto with valet parking. Sad."
Allison R.,"Elk Grove, CA",235,24,21,5.0,3/31/2013,"I came here for the first time on my birthday and oh my Jesus, the food was amazing! I ordered the herb salmon I believe and everything on it was awesome. The potatoes were a bit too salty but everything else was good! Afterwards I ordered the Oreo cheesecake and it was good. A little too sweet for my taste but overall it filled me well."
Anthony W.,"Sacramento, CA",407,409,109,4.0,5/4/2008,"This review is based on a few special happenings: 1. You go on an odd time so you don't have to wait in line. I think I was there like 11am on a Saturday. If I had to wait a 1/2 to 1 hour to be seated I'd be outta there. 2. You order exactly what I ordered. I can't attest to the quality of any other dishes. So this review is really for the 2 items I have ordered and thoroughly enjoyed. First item is the RANCH HOUSE BURGER (Pieces of Steak, Sauteed Mushrooms and Onions, Crisp Bacon and Cheddar Cheese on Top of Our Classic Burger. Served with Fries). It was one of the most memorable burgers I've had the pleasure of eating. It was incredibly juicy, cooked with a little pink just like I asked, piping hot when I received it, bun toasted just right, tender little pieces of steak on top, and absolutely delectable. One the downside I added 10 to my cholesterol reading. The second item is the appetizer sampler (""Factory Appetizer Favorites"").  Great way for 2 people to sample a bunch tantalizing little treats. The item I remember the most was the avocado egg rolls. I loved the combination of ingredients in there, including cilantro and sun dried tomatos. The dipping sauce was excellente. Service was fine, no complaints. The cooks were nice enough to wave at my curious kids. +1 I'm a little embarrassed giving 4 stars to a major chain, but hey, my palate must report all good gastronomical events, whether they are corporate or mom & pop."
