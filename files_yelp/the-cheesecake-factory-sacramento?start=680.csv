Clark P.,"Antelope, CA",3,175,48,5.0,10/19/2015,Excellent service. Our server was great! She made sure every order was correct including specialized orders around my food allergies and quickly had my order remade after a small error had been made in the kitchen. Food was great! We will definitely be back! Keep up the good work guys!
A g.,"Fairfield, CA",31,14,7,1.0,4/1/2012,"My date and I came here and will NEVER come back! My date ordered a steak cooked well done and received a steak burnt on the outside and blood red on the inside while it was already swimming in it's own blood. He cut the corner piece off and wouldn't eat it. We called the manager over who apologized and took it back for what we thought would be a replacement. They brought back the EXACT SAME STEAK WITH THE PIECE HE CUT OFF PUSHED AGAINST THE REST OF THE STEAK!!!! How filthy and unsanitary! We don't know where that steak had been between our table and the kitchen. Not to mention the fact that not only was it cooked to one temperature then cooled to almost room temp and then placed back on the stove to bring the temp up again?? Is that safe?  I ordered the chicken bellagio which tasted like the butter noodles I used to eat when I didn't have anything else to eat, it tasted like poor mans food except it cost $15 freakin bucks. The chicken was doughy with no taste at all. To top it all off we were seated next to a servers station where this tall chick wearing glasses with a gap and black hair. She bitched and complained about how she could be at home right now and these people were getting on her nerves. Then she says thanks for letting me vent, I turned and told her be thankful she had a job and next time I don't want to hear all of that crap on MY evening with my man. I will never and I mean never come here again it was an absolute waste of time and money. They did comp our cheesecake slices which were obviously amazing but other than that consider the cheesecake factory dead to me."
tre c.,"Sacramento, CA",2,14,297,4.0,10/18/2010,"I came here a several months ago with a friend and he ordered some meat entree that started with a ""H""  for me. I couldn't remember what it was called, but I do recall it was delicious. During that time, I didn't want to look like a pig so I didn't finish my meal. Ate only half of the meal. Awww... Although in my mind, I was thinking, ""Man, watch me come back and kill it!"" hahaha.. So when another friend of mine called up and asked, ""I owe you a late birthday dinner, where do you want to go?""  Cheesecake Factory! - since It has been months that I haven't been there and that entree that I had was calling my name, asking me when I'm going to reacquaint with it. Ordered: 1.  Fresh grilled salmon w/ steamed broccoli and mashed potatoes.      -I just ate a little piece of his salmon, which wasn't bad. I came here for the ""H"" entree!!       2.  HIBACHI steak, which had shitake mushrooms, onions, wasabi mashed potatoes and tempura asparagus.        -Yay! Viewed the menu and remembered where it was on that page, so I think that was the only entree w/ the letter ""H"" in front, and remembered it had wasabi in it. Loved the sauce to the steak and mushrooms. I was nice enough to share the meat. Med/rare, please. But it didn't come out hot or warm enough, seems like room temp, so that was a disappointment. I always liked eating the mashed potatoes from here. But I ended up killing my meal. Woo hoo!! Ok, I lied, left 1 spoonful of mashed potatoes on the plate. boo hoo hoo... 3. a glass of The Cheesecake Factory Cabernet Sauvignon      -I liked this. A little sweet blend. Goes great w/ the hibachi steak.  4. a glass of The Cheesecake Factory Merlot      -a tad bit stronger than the Cab, but still good. 5.  2 shots of grey goose       -what more can I say about shots? Except... shots, shots, shots, shots!!! hahaha.. Since it was a late bday dinner, they came out w/ a sundae w/ a candle on top, singing the ""Happy Birthday"" song. Cool, cool!!"
Debra D.,"Redding, CA",6,37,8,5.0,4/21/2013,"Ask for Joshua to be your server. He is quick, knows the menu well, is very attentive, polite and very friendly. Best server I've had in quite some time.  The restaurant and restrooms seemed to be clean. It was a busy Sunday afternoon and our wait was less than 5 minutes. The food also arrived in good time. It was fresh (I ordered the Tuscan Chicken), and the portion was huge. We ordered a slice of the Oreo cheesecake to share between 5 people. YUMM!!!  I will definitely want to go back to this restaurant."
Jesse C.,"Elk Grove, CA",23,20,3,5.0,9/28/2014,Excellent restaurant for a date. The dim setting is perfect with quality service.  Our waitress Shana M was very knowledgeable about the menu. The price very reasonable for the exceptional food.
Collin W.,"Sacramento, CA",4,286,10,4.0,8/7/2014,Great food for a big national chain. I love the dulce de leche and Godiva chocolate cheesecakes. Also the strawberry lemonade is amazing and free refills!
Mary M.,"Shingle Springs, CA",0,43,,4.0,10/15/2012,"So...I am not a huge fan of chain restaurants, but this was close to the shoe store, so we decided to go in here.  We came in the side door by the patio and ended up in the bar.  Luckily there was two spots on the end for us, because the lobby was full of people already at a little bit before 5pm! I was super thirsty and ordered the New Castle on tap and my-oh-my this was super cold and super yummy!!! I love it when I find a place that serves their beer ICE cold.  I quickly slurped that bad boy down.  My gf is not a big beer drinker, and when I let her tasted mine, she was impressed and subsequently ordered her own.  (You can see how frosty their beer is by the metal ""pipes"" if you will, leading to the tap is frosty-frozen.) We got served some warm bread with butter before dinner.  And may I say that there is a lost art of having warm bread served at restaurants these days it seems.  Sure, I don't need the extra carbs (who does), but damn...I love the dark bread and the sourdough isn't half bad either!  She ordered the blackened Jamaican shrimp with black beans and plantains.  I am not a shrimp person, but she said that it was heavenly!   I ordered a toss green salad, to get some vegetables in my diet that day with the house vinaigrette and it was spot on.  Sometimes the vinaigrette can be too acidic, but this one was perfect.  I also ordered the garlic spaghetti without meat and that was super tasty too.  Unfortunately neither of us had room for dessert...I know, I know...i know, how dare us go there without any cheese cake!   I'll be returning, initially for a frosty glass of new castle and then whatever tickles my fancy for eats!!!"
Rtz Q.,"Elk Grove, CA",2,19,,1.0,2/7/2014,More like cheese cock factory. I couldn't be seated with the rest of my family. We had a party of 22. Called the day before and even had someone there a hr ahead to reserve the seats. We all show up and are told we are going to all be seated in 4 groups of 6. I don't recommend this place for a big party. Shit fuck.
Amy Q.,"Reno, NV",710,205,116,4.0,11/16/2010,"ZZZZzzZ...they have such a HUGE menu, I never know what I want except almost everything in their dessert book. Seriously, I spent $50 on 6 different cheesecakes and a slice of their to-die-for Black Out Cake. Its layers of moist chocolate cake with truffle filling and even has chocolate chips in it with a layer of almonds on the outside.  I love their lunch selection because you can get half-portions of their pasta for half the price. I ordered the Pasta Carbonara and every bite had peas with crispy bacon and creamy eggy sauce. The noodles were cooked perfectly and there was even enough sauce to take the complimentary french/rye bread and dip in.  The hostess/waitresses/waiters are all beautiful here too! They were super friendly and attentive to the tables. They didn't sneer when I wanted to share an entree with a friend for dinner last night. It was quite busy for a Monday night also, and if our waitress went on break, there would be another one coming along to inform us. The interior design is really homey feeling and alot more upscale.  I love the huge bows that the hostess have in the back of their apron. Its so chic."
Missy S.,"Sacramento, CA",2,20,5,5.0,5/21/2014,Amazing!!! My fiancé and I have not been to the Cheesecake Factory in a long time and tonight we thought we'd try it out. Such a good choice. I got the Parmesan crusted chicken and Steve got the pit beef dip both were great sizes nicely displayed and the taste was amazing. Also the service was great. Our seats not so much wish we could have gotten a booth but still it was a very nice visit. We'll definitely be coming back.
Beth H.,"Boulder, CO",24,166,6,4.0,4/7/2014,"I came here late sunday night because I hadn't eaten dinner yet and most other restaurants in the area were closed. My boyfriend and I decided to get three appetizers to share. We ordered the portabella mushroom, avocado, and zucchini fries, the crispy crab bites, and the crab wontons. All of them were really tasty!!"
diane w.,"Stockton, CA",12,16,10,1.0,1/27/2014,"Honestly I'm very disappointed I love Cheesecake Factory but the past two times my family and I have gone there the food has been terrible. Steaks not cooked properly I ordered my medium well and it was burned on one side. My dad actually had to have his steak taken back to be remade . On the plus side we did get a free dessert but seriously for the prices that customers are paying the food has to be prepared way better. My mashed potatoes and a wrapper in them which I didn't know until I got home and ate my left overs. The lemon sauce for the salmon is watery. Definitely not how the food used to be, maybe at a different location it'll be different but this one definitely needs new cooks/chefs ASAP I'm disgusted to even think about how the food is prepared no exaggeration. Some of our plates were dirty.....cold cheeseburger definitely not worth it."
Carmel S.,"Elk Grove, CA",103,87,49,4.0,1/21/2012,"Since I was a teenager, I've always loved coming to The Cheesecake Factory.  Consistently good: food service ambience cleanliness and of course.. The CHEESECAKE!  Recommendations: - Starwberry Martini - Passionfruit Mojito - Calamari - Chicken Samosas - Small Plates - Fettuccini Alfredo w/ Sundried tomatoes - Crispy Beef - Chicken Bellagio - Garlic Noodles - Salmon  - Steak Medallion - Dulce De Leche Cheesecake - Oreo Cheesecake They also have a  ""Skinny Menu"" for those watching what they eat. Love it!"
Christopher W.,"Sacramento, CA",124,213,,2.0,4/8/2012,"Please don't tell me people actually think this is gourmet food. PLEASE!?!?! i know that sounds snobby but overcooked salmon, burgers that are so soaked in grease that they fall apart and salads that just don't taste right cannot be redeemed by a dining room decorated like the lobby of a nice holiday inn.  their appetizers are good with a drink i suppose.  actually the bar's offerings aren't bad but these entrees could literally be heated up from the frozen food aisle. service is usually good though."
Patti R.,"Sacramento, CA",105,549,113,1.0,2/17/2012,"Never again. I am done. We got there at 4:30...WELL before the crush. Our server was indifferent at best. My orange chicken was only okay. More than half was overcooked and dry. She never came back around, so I couldn't send it back. Hubby's cashew chicken was good, except for his rice was dry.  For the price paid ($40--no alcohol, just iced tea) it was TOTALLY NOT WORTH IT."
Luis P.,"Sacramento, CA",0,14,2,2.0,5/25/2016,"I love coming to the Cheesecake Factory at this location, but today was a little disappointing. The server was mediocre and didn't even ask how the food was. The Thai Lettuce Wraps as an appetizer is always the best item for me to get when I go there. I can't complain about the wraps during today's visit because they amazing as always! However, the Chicken Madeira today was really bad! The plate was cold; the cheese was hard; there was little to no flavor; and the whole plate was pretty much dry. I have to say I was not happy with today's visit. This place usually does a pretty good job in attending to their customer needs, but today the service wasn't even that great. In addition, the waitress brought us the wrong dessert and insisted that it was the right order. Anyway, if you are going to going to spend a lot of money on this place, especially for birthday like how I did, make sure you are on top of the service and food they prepare for you."
Monica M.,"Sacramento, CA",180,213,38,4.0,12/22/2009,"Oh Cheesecake Factory and your HUGE portion size.  We were taken here by our boss for a Christmas lunch last week.  I decided on the lunch pizza and house salad expecting what you would find a local pizza joint, you know, a small bowl of salad and personal sized pizza.  What came was a surprise...a huge salad (dressing on the side) and my tomato, basil & cheese pizza that 2 people could have easily shared. Yeah for leftovers!  Our waitress was on the ball and I was very impressed as we were a party of 9.  Oh, desserts...  I'm not a cheesecake type of girl, but can someone say Black-Out cake! To. Die. For."
Mandeep S.,"Elk Grove, CA",82,238,171,3.0,6/3/2014,"The wait is always long. The food is good. They have many different types of cheesecakes and it is all great. Parking sucks since it is next to the very busy Arden Fair Mall but they do offer valet parking if needed. Some tables are really close together so it seems like you are sharing a meal with strangers but overall, a good place to if you are hungry."
Leticia M.,"Sacramento, CA",0,54,106,3.0,8/3/2014,"Great food, great service ,great cheesecake, but the wait was horrible had to wait for 1hr 30min. If you come here don't come in a party bigger than 10ppl, or you will wait for ever"
Annie N.,"Sacramento, CA",8,71,10,4.0,11/7/2012,"I used to frequent this place often but my last few visits were slightly disappointing.. Service has definitely plummeted. I came here about two weeks ago with my significant other and my server did not give us any water until we asked and it seemed like she catered more to the ""wealthy"" looking customers than people who look ""young""... (Mind you, I work at a restaurant and I definitely do know how to tip!!!) Any who, I would recommend the Hibachi Steak or the Miso Salmon. Everything was so juicy and came out piping hot. The food presentation is beautiful. However.. when I had asked her for togo boxes, she asked me very rudely if I wanted to box it myself or if I wanted her to do it.. implying that I should do it myself. Usually the server helps me box it but I guess she was just having a bad day?"
