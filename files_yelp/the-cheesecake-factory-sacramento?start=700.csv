Jade D.,"Sacramento, CA",0,6,,5.0,11/7/2015,Umm the herb chicken with mashed potatoes are bomb and there strawberry shortcake is delicious .But the wait is about 30 minutes but food is delicious.
C C.,"Roseville, CA",1,19,2,4.0,11/27/2012,"Went here the day before Thanksgiving with 3 other office mates for a birthday lunch. Now when office workers come for lunch, time is *always* important. With this in mind, here's my review: We were seated right away and Paul introduced himself as our server. For starters, each one of us ordered something different to drink - 3 diff Iced Teas (Plain, Tropical and Green), we each ordered a diff Tea and one diet soda...Paul brought the bread and all but the Green Tea. We were all over the warm dark bread as we were sooo hungry! But after at least 5 minutes, my Green Iced Tea still hadn't arrived and after chowin' the bread - I was thirsty! ;-( FWIW: We didn't receive auto-water, but I'm OK with that -any time-, b'cuz I understand and am a big fan of not wasting water, so if we don't ask for it, we don't need it... period. As a matter of fact, I will look at water being served automatically as a negative.  Paul returns to take our orders, and we ask about my tea, ""Oh, we have to get that from the Bar and I'll have to check on it"". Oh?! You should have checked on it BEFORE you returned to take our order...  Grrrrr....  He leaves and returns with my tea... Paul then takes our orders, suggesting a couple of things, based on inquiries from my friends, and his suggestions were spot-on to what my friends were interested in, which was the Grilled Eggplant sandwich with Sweet Potato Fries.  Feeling for spicy, I ordered the Cajun Burger and my other friend ordered the Factory Burger. BTW, I *rarely* order burgers, but the Cajun seemed to fit my crave for spicy this day...  Paul asked how I'd like it cooked (med-rare, thank you) and got the green salad side with Bleu Cheese dressing. He sped off, neglecting to ask the other Burger order how he'd like it cooked. We discuss how long it will take for Paul to return with that question - another 7 minutes and he finally returns to ask! Remember? We were on limited time...! Grrrrr... Our food arrived, except for mine -again-  :-(   All looked fab, and the Factory burger was cooked to order nicely -well done-, so why didn't my Cajun burger make it to the table? It takes less time to cook a burger to med-rare than well-done, right? No explaination from our server. I munched on my friends' Sweet Potato Fries while I waited....   My Cajun Burger arrived and it looked fab (sorry, was so hungry, forgot to take pics); cooked to perfection and tasted great, BUT, it was not in the least bit spicy. After I chowed 2/3rds of it, I realized the Andouille sausage was missing! Dammit! Too late to complain, so I sucked the rest of it down. But am here to comment and wonder how such a fab place (I *love* their decor and ambience, and their food offerings are quite good) can screw up so big?!   So that's my latest experience, 4 stars, they need to figure out the Iced Green Tea offer and remember the Andouille sausage, dammit... !"
Paula B.,"Los Angeles, CA",201,318,59,4.0,4/26/2012,"This cheesecake factory, like many cheesecake factories, was aligned with the chesecake factory brand. This one in particular had good service. Our waitress introduced herself, her name, and was very very helpful and good. They did not put kalamata olives on my pizza, even though I asked for it - but, I did, as always put a detailed order (Half goat cheese/half mozerella everything pizza with no sausage, extra kalamata and a side of tobasco). We waited for our food for a decent amount of time...but, I rate this cheesecake four stars~!"
Gary W.,"Manteca, CA",55,189,536,4.0,2/15/2014,Much better this time around.  Garlic parm cheese bread was great.  Had the gumbo.  It was loaded with shrimp and chicken.  This location changed my mind about not coming back.
Song C.,"San Francisco, CA",486,373,134,5.0,8/23/2010,"I don't care what people say, I've been in love with Cheesecake Factory since the first time I experienced it. The menu is constantly growing with more and better dishes! I like real authentic places versus  ""chains"" but I feel like Cheesecake stands out from the rest.  The food and service are always superb. I feel like I'm eating at a fancy restaurant without the fancy shmancy atmosphere.  I love that they bake their bread fresh everyday. Drinks are well made as well. Honestly, I have to say this might be my favorite place for dinner because I can always find something that fits me or my boyfriend's craving.  Never a dull moment. I actually try to hit up as many locations as possible.  If I'm in a new city and I see a Cheesecake, I will definitely hit it up because I know what I'm getting. Great place for a dinner date. The line is always worth the wait.  Too many good dishes to name but you can never go wrong with the burgers, steaks or pastas. If you are looking for a light meal, try the salmon.  Salads are gi-normous!  Chicken is always a safe bet. Tuna carpaccio and avocado egg rolls are the must haves!"
Mack K.,"Davis, CA",1,23,,5.0,7/20/2014,"I always enjoy going to the Cheesecake Factory. There are so many items on the menu, that it can become difficult to choose what you want to order. My favorites are: Jamaican black pepper chicken and shrimp, chicken costoletta, Cajun jambalaya, and crab cake sandwich. The nachos are a meal in itself and loaded with toppings. Make sure to leave room for dessert or take it to go. As you can guess by the name, they have a huge variety of cheesecakes to choose from. I recommend the: tiramisu cheesecake, white chocolate raspberry cheesecake, and mango key lime cheesecake."
Mary S.,"Sacramento, CA",0,6,,2.0,10/25/2015,"Ok after church myself and 2 daughters went here to eat I ordered catfish plate 17 buck's and change 1 daughter got pasta was pleased until she found out they charged her for sausages that came with order  but  ,waitress correct charge, my fish plate had potatoes that was cold,string beans that was cold tough and not cooked and fish was warm and not good so they ,gave me another plate that was worser than 1st  I told waitress forget it issue refund and was pissed ,2nd daughter had cheese burger and fries she shared her meal . with me,,1st visit and last for me experience was horrible. Food was not cook well at all."
Erica S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,68,35,3.0,8/9/2014,"Went here because we got in late to our hotel and it was open very late (12:30). Very loud and dark, as per usual with this place. Maybe would've been better if there hadn't been two very large and noisy birthday groups screaming by the bar the whole time. We were seated far away in the corner but could still hear them. So dark I had to use my cell phone flashlight to read the menu. Had the Caesar Salad and Shrimp Scampi. The portions here are enormous. My Caesar was the smallest size and could've fed three people. Shrimp Scampi was delicious, 6 very generously sized lightly breaded shrimp in a yummy cream sauce. The best part of the entire meal is the bread (is it pumpernickel?). So good."
Emy B.,"San Francisco, CA",34,489,197,4.0,8/2/2010,"Brunch with my fam bam here was pretty righteous.  The eggs benedict with spinach & tomato was off the hook (in my Guy Fieri voice)!  And noticed there was a kids brunch choice too (french toast, bacon & strawberries)...what a deal for a little kid like mine. We also shared the ricotta & lemon zest pancakes - really, really, really good & light.  You can't miss this one.  And our server (Lisa) was super nice and gave such fab service...she definitely deserved the 20% tip.  Thanks Lisa!"
Derick F.,"Sacramento, CA",343,335,363,3.0,12/13/2009,"WTF Man!!!  What the hell kind of sick place puts the calories right on the food they're serving.  It's almost like killing a baby cow so you can eat veal. You feel hella guilty, but to quote my favorite movie: "" It's so good... once it hits your lips it's so good.""  I wouldn't mind if they had it on the menu above, bu there is just something about looking at the product and calorie numbers especially if they're in the high triple digits.  Oh I just miss the days where I could just pick it something out and not care. Thank you California legislation... Any ways The food is good, the Cheese cake is awesome. Minus 1 star for being a bit pricey (8 bucks for a slice I could sell my kidney and maybe get 3), and minus 1 star for having the calories right on the food, it takes the fun out of eating.  BTW the chicken pasta with the arugula salad on top is very tasty."
Suzy T.,"Clayton, CA",5,22,24,4.0,1/31/2014,Great service and food was good. So was the yummy moscato!! The avocado egg rolls were good. Quick service and friendly waiters.
Steve A.,"Rogue River, OR",111,227,167,3.0,5/17/2012,"Went on mothers day for dessert. I had the carrot cake cheesecake, delicious. I don't remember what they had but they were pretty happy. The only real complaint I had was that there was something slippery on the tile floor by our table (butter or something) and my mom slipped and almost ate $hit. Service was good."
El B.,"Sacramento, CA",56,26,,1.0,11/30/2011,"I would never choose to go to this place of my own accord, but my mother-in-law wanted to go here for Sunday brunch on father's day for my husband and my dad-in-law. We arrived right at 10am when it opened and there were at least a dozen other HELLA old people their waiting to get in and at least one chick who looked like she was still wearing her club outfit from the night before. The waiters all looked like they were nursing hangovers and the service was super slow. The food was bland and I felt nauseous after eating it. Hopefully no one ever suggests this place again."
Trevor B.,"Redding, CA",44,31,21,4.0,4/10/2012,"Although it may at times be a bit loud and get crowded in the entrance from all of the people making reservations, the food is great! I love the bread they serve as an appetizer. The portions are usually very big. Sometimes it's difficult to figure out what to order because there are so many options.  My favorite cake is the blackout cake by far!!  It's amazing! The sliders are amazing and the buffalo blasts! So good!  So many great dishes here!  I think everybody should experience the cheesecake factory!"
Clarissa F.,"Sacramento, CA",31,19,,4.0,4/9/2012,"I've been here before, plenty of times but I'm going to share a little inside tip.  If you've ever gone to this Cheesecake Factory, you know there will be a lot of people and a long wait.  Well my tip, go on Easter Sunday and you won't find a lot of people or a long wait.  I've never seen Cheesecake Factory so empty.  Kinda liked it. Only had drinks and apps w/ hubby so I enjoyed Strawberry Martini and Asian Chicken Wraps.  Usually if I'm coming here for dinner, I like to order the Luau Salad. It's yummy!"
Beth B.,"Carmichael, CA",9,15,,3.0,7/22/2015,"Service was good.  Food was just fair.  Should be better for the price.  Didn't have any cheese cake, just lunch."
Violet W.,"San Francisco, CA",262,217,577,3.0,9/27/2011,"If I was asked to describe the Cheesecake Factory in a word...I would use ""okay.""  The food is okay, you can't go wrong with the Diane steak & their Herb crusted salmon or their Jambalaya.  But nothing on their menu is worth raving about... the service here is okay too. Overall, The Cheesecake Factory = Okay."
Ernie C.,"Fairchild Air Force Base, WA",65,25,5,3.0,12/1/2013,"Honestly. I don't know to chalk my experience here up to bad luck or if it was just normal operations. My girlfriend and I get here and wind up getting seated pretty quickly. As a matter of fact, we wind up being seated right next to the server booth.  But from there it starts to slide down hill.   Our utensils were dirty. There was mysterious ""floaties"" in our waters... This turned us off from eating anything big here and we settled on the sliders and a piece of cheesecake.  The second set of utensils we got were dirty as well, and our sliders were more grease than meat!   The only thing that saved this place where the cheesecakes. But then again if you screw that up and that's your name sake then you have serious problems...  If I go to this place again... I be wise and bring a signal flare to get the attention of the servers. Considering how close we were to their terminal, we were basically ignored a good portion of the time..."
Janice N.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,48,,2.0,8/22/2015,"The service here has gone down the drain in the last year. We just went there for my nephew's birthday and man were we disappointed. They forgot to put in my son's order. (He's 6, and kept asking where his food was, after all of us got ours.)  When he finally got it, it was totally underdone and tasteless. Chicken on one of the orders was raw. Isn't that a major health hazard? it took forever for them to re fire it. When complained to the manager, he acted like he could care less. I'd rather take my business else where."
Jessica T.,"Sacramento, CA",572,224,38,2.0,9/13/2011,"You bet your ass I'm reviewing the Cheesecake Factory. I've been to a few and they're fairly consistent but this one rates below average.  The amount of flies around our table was just creepy  (and nooo smarty-pants they didn't follow us in).  After looking under the table of our booth we realized that the flies were hovering around due to all the snackins that were lying around by our feet.  I can't imagine a large chain restaurant like this wouldn't sweep at least once a day so I can only assume this was from the brunch crowd that came before us. The server was pretty cheesy.  He would probably be fine for a table with a bunch of kids but it was just my boyfriend and I so not really a good fit. On the plus side, the avocado egg rolls were fresh and had a nice crunch to them. I enjoyed the salad, which was micro greens with balsamic, not that horrible mix of iceberg and carrot slivers that passes for a house salad at many establishments. The pizza can take a hike though.  If they can clean up their act, this location will fit in neatly with the rest of the bunch at a comfortable three stars."
