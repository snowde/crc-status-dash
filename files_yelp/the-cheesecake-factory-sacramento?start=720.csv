Salman M.,"Sacramento, CA",0,3,,1.0,3/21/2015,You call to make an order over the phone I swear it's like you're speaking French They don't even know what the hell are you talking about then you get there to pick up the order to take some 4 minutes to find it
Ofelia S.,"West Sacramento, CA",2,69,,1.0,6/13/2015,I remember how good this place used to be. I understand raising prices (even slightly smaller portion) to offset rising food costs- but lower quality/taste is unacceptable. My husband's burger (old fashioned) was good- but not really worth the price. My shrimp and steak combo was sad- obviously sat under the heat lamp too long as the mashed potato was hard and the meat was almost room temp. And the shrimp scampi was breaded to death! Should have just gone to in-n-out!!
Kris I.,"Kapolei, HI",182,408,237,4.0,6/8/2010,"I went on a Monday night (it was Memorial Day) and arrived with 15 other girls. We knew that Cheesecake Factory doesn't take reservations, so we were expecting to wait a while (especially when you have such a large group, you know?).  Wait time: 0 minutes. Um, AMAZING. I've tried getting tables for 10 at the Cheesecake Factory in Santa Clara/San Jose and that takes an hour! But probably because it was a Friday or Saturday... haha but still, kudos to the Cheesecake Factory in Sac for being awesome. the end."
Imogen A.,"Rio Linda, CA",24,129,101,4.0,3/5/2014,"The food I had was amazing.  I took one star because they have literally NOTHING there for diabetic patrons.  The only thing I could order at the time when I had gestational diabetes was the grilled salmon w extra veggies instead of potatoes.   They DO have a splenda cheesecake, but it is still so high in sugar that a realistic portion is only 1/2 a slice.   It would be nice if they had just a few more healthy options...especially since some people want to save room for the CHEESCAKE!"
Cindy T.,"Sacramento, CA",0,4,2,5.0,9/18/2015,Went there on a thursday night. It was pretty busy and waited about 10 minute for a table of 2 which was fine. Our server was Sara. She was busy but still took care of us. Had a great night and would recommend this place to my family and friends.
Jessica S.,"Sacramento, CA",26,123,2,2.0,5/16/2015,"It had been a long time since we've been to cheese cake factory. I was really disappointed. When the receptionist brought us to our table she took us outside. We did not ask for a table outside and when I checked In they didn't ask if we wanted to be outside. It was late last night and I really didn't feel like freezing my butt off. So I told them we didn't want to sit outside. They said we would have to wait another 20 minutes for a table. REALLY?????!!!!!! Why should we wait another 20 minutes when it's not our fault you didn't ask me if we wanted outside seating? There was no apology. When they finally came to sit us down the table wasn't ready, they were still setting up. There were plenty of tables around. I know I haven't been to this restaurant in a long time but it sure felt like the staff was new and didn't know what they were doing. Oh and let me also say they ran out of the Friday soup clam chowder. So we were offered the next soup well the soup wasn't going to be ready for us to have with our meal or even to bring home. The waiter kindly offered a slice of cake we accepted. Not sure if we will be back"
Alex L.,"Oakland, CA",38,58,29,4.0,4/13/2014,"The food is good, I enjoy their chicken pastas because the meat tastes fresh. I don't expect to be blown away by the food either because it's a chain restaurant. Drinks are good as well but it's called the Cheesecake Factory so drinks and food are obviously not #1. I love their cheesecake so much that I savior every single small fatty bite by eating it very very slowly. I love it all, from the pecan pumpkin cheesecake to the basic strawberry cheesecake. I always order to go and when I do the staff always greet me and are very kind, plus they are quick too!"
Megan S.,"Concord, CA",18,15,1,4.0,11/30/2011,"I love the cheesecake factory.  The good: The food is always good.  The cheesecake is to die for. The bar is good, [price is okayyy] whats not to like? The eahhh: The staff is a hit or miss.  Ive had some wonderful stuff who keep my soda filled and made sure my food was good.  The story: I went yesterday for a late lunch with my mom. The place wasn't full at all go seated right away, the girl (never got her name) wad RUDE. It was never what she said so much as her tone. And i mean, i wouldn't have called her RUDE if that was it. She took my moms soda for a refill and never came back. .... ?? as i said before the place wasn't' full. Where did you go with our soda lady?? she came back ten minutes later to check on us. My mom said, ""Everything's wonderful but id really like my soda back."" she said, ""OK. Anything else?"" With a tone. and i mean. That was it. Nothing too huge, but it did take away from a star.  I also got an Adams peanut-butter fudge ripple to go. It was wonderful."
Christina V.,"Sacramento, CA",0,20,13,3.0,12/22/2012,"Had the bbq salmon dish and it was good. The only downer is that the fried onion strips on the dish tasted soooo much better than the salmon. I watch a lot of Top Chefs, and you should never have anything outshine the protein on the dish - :)... Their desserts are to die for. I was good and didn't order any but my friends did (shame on them!) and they gave their approvals."
Angelica F.,"Davis, CA",105,13,5,1.0,9/13/2014,"I recently went to this restaurant with a group of friends, it wasn't a very good experience. The service was HORRIBLE. I work for a restaurant as well so I try to be patient with the staff....this time it was mission impossible. The waitress took 25 min to ask for our drinks and another 15 to bring them. After that she didn't pay much attention as we ordered, she seemed very distracted. It took a while for our appetizers to come and even longer for our food. When our food was delivered I asked for a side of mushrooms.... They did not come until the end of the meal!!! Also, when my glass was empty and the waitress was no where in sight I asked another waitress for some water. She denied me water saying: ""I'm sorry, I am not your waitress, I can't help you"". I then asked if she could ask our waitress to come see us, she replied : ""No, I'm busy. Sorry."" I know it sounds unbelievable but it truly happened. Not to mention our check out took a total of 40min.  Waste of life."
Abigail L.,"Sacramento, CA",556,632,1580,3.0,6/15/2012,"Mer, I am not a huge fan of cheesecake factory. I ordered their factory chopped salad while my dad ordered their kobe beef burger. The factory chopped salad was just okay and I expected it to be a bigger portion for the amount I paid for. The burger was also just okay, now they put their fries in a little metal cup and it seems like they give you a lot less fries than when they just served it on the plate. I did like their fresh sour dough bread with butter. Overall, for the amount I paid I expected better and more food. I would never choose to come here but if my friends or family wanted to come here I would. I think there are just a lot of better options in downtown and midtown for food that isn't a huge chain. The service at cheesecake factory was superb though."
Mali T.,"Sacramento, CA",142,97,138,5.0,10/24/2011,"Okay as for me- This place deserves a 5 star for affordable pricing and exceptional quantity! And also for their Miso Salmon,Seared Tataki AHI Tuna Salad and great selection of Cheesecake ..Super delicious! What I like about the CheeseCake Factory is that they are unique and creative! They serve varieties of Cheesecake and have a great fusion of dishes that influences different country and culture. I mean you can never go wrong here! So many selections to choose from and the staffing are great! I been here numerous times and it's been a treat every time. What I had so far here....See below for reviews of each items Fried Macaroni and Cheese- Pretty good Fried Calamari- Pretty good Tex Mex Eggrolls- Pretty good Spicy Ahi Tempura Roll- Yummy! Ahi Carpaccio- Yummy! Thai Lettuce Wraps- Good flavor, but I love P.F. Chang's the best Crispy Crab Wontons -Yummy AHI Tartare- Yummy, but small in portion Firecracker Salmon - Yummy Salisbury Chopped Steak- I like this dish a lot Miso Salmon- The best I ever had Tuna Tataki Salad- I'm in love with this dish- The dressing is delicious Caramel Chicken- Yummy Lemon-Herb Roasted Chicken- Yummy Chicken Marsala and Mushrooms- Pretty good, but Olive Garden ones are the best Chicken and Biscuit- Surprisingly good Grilled Rib- Eye in Cajun style are the best! Flavorful Grilled Pork Chops- Tasty, but had better ones Steak Diane- Not my favorite, but good Hibachi Steak- Tasty but not my fav. Chargrilled Coulotte Steak - HONESTLY- Haven't try this dish yet lol- That'll be next on me next visit Shrimp and Chicken Gumbo - Yummy Wasabi Crusted Ahi Tuna- Yummy, love that hint of wasabi Like I say- This place is amazing when it comes to selection and portions.

My goal is to try everything on their menu..hehe Oh and last but not least...My favorite Cheesecake there are...     The Original     Fresh Strawberry     Red Velvet Cake Cheesecake     Reese's® Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake Cheesecake     White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle®     White Chocolate Caramel Macadamia Nut Cheesecake     Lemon Raspberry Cream Cheesecake     Dulce de Leche Caramel Cheesecake     Tiramisu Cheesecake     Kahlua® Cocoa Coffee Cheesecake     Chocolate Raspberry Truffle®     Oreo® Cheesecake     Wild Blueberry White Chocolate Cheesecake™     Key Lime Cheesecake     Caramel Pecan Turtle Cheesecake     Snickers® Bar Chunks and Cheesecake     Pumpkin Pecan Cheesecake     Bon Apetite! Yummy in my tummy"
Anna S.,"Roseville, CA",54,210,101,3.0,5/5/2012,"I came here for my fiancés best friend's 21st birthday.  This is just like any other Cheesecake Factory. Big, loud and a ton of food. We came on a Monday evening and were seated right away. We had a party of 8 but 4 of the members didn't join us until desert. They sat us in the bar area because of this (dumb!) My friend got the Twisted Pretzel drink for his first legal drink. It was amazing. It tasted a lot like a milk shake with chunks of pretzels and vodka. He also got a peach drink, not sure of the name. Both drinks were $10. Not sure they were worth $10 but I have to admit that Twisted Pretzel was awesome. We all shared the avocado egg rolls ($9.99) it was a large appetizer. Lots of avocado, they certainly don't skimp. This place is pretty pricey. Most of the entrees are $12+. I have to say though the portions are huge. I ordered the Shepherds Pie. It was so good except not enough mashed potato for the meat mixture. My fiancé got the Carlson Salad. It had a lot of different fruits and cheese on it. He said it was good. He didn't finish it though. My friend got the Grilled Salmon and it was delicious. They cooked the salmon well and paired it with awesome mashed potatoes. It lay on a corn salsa. His girlfriend got the Hibachi Steak. It was presented really nicely. Again, LARGE portion. For desert we both got the Snickers Cheesecake ($6.99) it was so expensive and so crazy good. The top is layered with chopped up snicker bars. The crust is crushed cookies and then it's drizzled with chocolate sauce and caramel. Oh it was so good.  So after a good dinner why did I dock 2 stars? Well.. THE SERVICE SUCKED!!!! It was so freaking slow! We ended up having 2 waitresses because one had to go to lunch (understandable) BUT they didn't communicate with each other so the order got delayed 20 minuets. Our dinner took 2 hours for 4 people. The other 4 of our party joined us as we were eating and had to wait forever to get dessert menus. It was just ridiculous. The only reason I will be back will be for the food... And the cheesecake."
Mim D.,"Sacramento, CA",317,113,75,5.0,1/10/2014,"I love it here! Great ambiance and great service! The food is tasty! Great spot to take a date. It's fairly priced and portioned. Great plating and they have a wide selection of cheesecakes that you can try, from your basic cheesecake to a chocolate overload. So save some room for that! I've been here many different times for different occasions and each time has never disappoint, when something went wrong the manager was quick to correct it and if they weren't able to, the meal was complimentary. The service is superb and it's one of the reasons I come back besides the delicious food. It does get packed some nights but that goes to show how wonderful the place is. Will definitely be returning time and time again."
Rachel M.,"Sacramento, CA",375,450,411,3.0,5/12/2012,"Okay, it's The Cheesecake Factory.  I normally avoid this restaurant but decided to give it another try. I met a friend here for lunch on a Monday, and the place wasn't too busy and we only had about a fifteen minute wait which isn't bad for a restaurant that seems to be very popular.   We were seated in a booth and were greeted by the most BLANDEST waiters ever.  He seriously didn't have a personality or was just having a bad day and didn't want to work.  Oh well.  My friend and I both ordered a strawberry lemonade (totally hit the spot) and my friend ordered the chicken fettucine and I ordered the chicken enchiladas.  I wasn't expecting much since this place seems to have such a vast menu and definitely didn't specialize in enchiladas.  However, I was quite surprised at how tasty they were.  I was served three decent sized enchiladas topped with melted cheeses and a side of black beans and rice.  My friend, although he ordered the half size of the fettucine, received quite a large portion as well.  Maybe that's why everyone loves this place - great portions!  My enchiladas were so good that I would definitely order them again. What I like most about The CF is that the place is huge and spacious.  The menu is another plus because literally anyone could find something on the menu to their liking.  They have a bit of everything:  burgers, pastas, sandwiches, ethnic foods, etc.  I think I may be back in the future to explore the menu a little more.  Even our boring and slow waiter didn't ruin my experience.  Nice!"
Parry L.,"Sacramento, CA",0,10,,4.0,9/14/2015,"i like this restaurant. Never got tired of my favourite Godiva and the Tiramisu cheesecakes. Always have great and fun experience there except once. It was not fun that I had to run to the bathroom three times after the food/lunch in short hours but I still a fan of this restaurant, still go for the great cheesecakes."
Africa G.,"Sacramento, CA",33,5,6,3.0,8/10/2011,"Love coming here but it's always pretty busy so expect a 15 min wait.. I love the yummy warm wheat bread so good! But the French bread is blah.. so not worth the carbs so pass on it ladies ;)  I would have given 4 stars because I love me some cheesecake factory! but the last time I got curb side to go service, on my way home from a long day.. They deemed it ok to put charred and dry old chicken in my enchiladas.. I guess because it was togo they assumed it was ok to put that in my food.. It also looked and tasted microwaved because the tortilla had this hard rubbery thing going on..  So instead of relaxing at home I have to drive all the way back and demand a refund.. Which they give after an argument over if it was really burned or not, really??  You would think after me driving there and back twice they would offer to give me the meal free.. But no they did not.. So because of crappy customer service, 3 stars"
Amanda C.,"Temecula, CA",148,423,33,5.0,6/16/2011,"I love, love, love, love, LOVE Cheesecake Factory. Wait. I don't think I expressed myself enough. I LOVE THE CHEESECAKE FACTORY!  Whew, okay. I got that off my chest.  There's two reasons why I adore this place. 1) They have the Godiva chocolate cheesecake which is pure heaven in your mouth (yeah, don't go there, you dirty minded folks) and 2) My father, the pickiest eater and biggest food complainer on the planet, shut up and ate his cheesecake.  That's some miracle working right there. They also have fried macaroni and cheese balls. They are delicious, but more importantly, they have Godiva chocolate cheesecake!"
Jimika G.,"Sacramento, CA",256,19,3,3.0,7/19/2012,Wait times are a hassle ! I came here for mother's day with my aunt and we had to wait an hour to be seated. There's always a line out the door for this place. The interior was nice and I like that they have outside seating.  I ordered a plate with some kind of stir fry ( dont remember the name ) but it was a pretty good portion and pretty delicious. I had leftovers to take home.  The bill was pretty expensive ...  the cheesecake prices are expensive . nothing much to brag about
J H.,"Austin, TX",40,2,,2.0,1/9/2014,"Ate here the other day, while the food was fairly good, there were some other issues.  Firstly, their soda mix was off, so the soda was flat and syrup-y, which as a person who enjoys soda, I found very annoying. I politely informed the waitress, but she did not seem to care. Secondly, the person who brought out the food, likely a manager of some sort, asked if I wanted ketchup and then brought some. It reminded me of the awful ketchup I had in middle school when the school tried to save money by buying canned generic ketchup and adding water to it.  These two issues may seem inconsequential to some people, but they are very important details to me. Details that make or break a dining experience."

Rachel M.,"Sacramento, United States",375,450,411,3.0,12/5/2012,"Okay, it's The Cheesecake Factory.  I normally avoid this restaurant but decided to give it another try. I met a friend here for lunch on a Monday, and the place wasn't too busy and we only had about a fifteen minute wait which isn't bad for a restaurant that seems to be very popular.   We were seated in a booth and were greeted by the most BLANDEST waiters ever.  He seriously didn't have a personality or was just having a bad day and didn't want to work.  Oh well.  My friend and I both ordered a strawberry lemonade (totally hit the spot) and my friend ordered the chicken fettucine and I ordered the chicken enchiladas.  I wasn't expecting much since this place seems to have such a vast menu and definitely didn't specialize in enchiladas.  However, I was quite surprised at how tasty they were.  I was served three decent sized enchiladas topped with melted cheeses and a side of black beans and rice.  My friend, although he ordered the half size of the fettucine, received quite a large portion as well.  Maybe that's why everyone loves this place - great portions!  My enchiladas were so good that I would definitely order them again. What I like most about The CF is that the place is huge and spacious.  The menu is another plus because literally anyone could find something on the menu to their liking.  They have a bit of everything:  burgers, pastas, sandwiches, ethnic foods, etc.  I think I may be back in the future to explore the menu a little more.  Even our boring and slow waiter didn't ruin my experience.  Nice!"
Parry L.,"Sacramento, United States",0,10,,4.0,14/9/2015,"i like this restaurant. Never got tired of my favourite Godiva and the Tiramisu cheesecakes. Always have great and fun experience there except once. It was not fun that I had to run to the bathroom three times after the food/lunch in short hours but I still a fan of this restaurant, still go for the great cheesecakes."
Africa G.,"Sacramento, United States",33,5,6,3.0,10/8/2011,"Love coming here but it's always pretty busy so expect a 15 min wait.. I love the yummy warm wheat bread so good! But the French bread is blah.. so not worth the carbs so pass on it ladies ;)  I would have given 4 stars because I love me some cheesecake factory! but the last time I got curb side to go service, on my way home from a long day.. They deemed it ok to put charred and dry old chicken in my enchiladas.. I guess because it was togo they assumed it was ok to put that in my food.. It also looked and tasted microwaved because the tortilla had this hard rubbery thing going on..  So instead of relaxing at home I have to drive all the way back and demand a refund.. Which they give after an argument over if it was really burned or not, really??  You would think after me driving there and back twice they would offer to give me the meal free.. But no they did not.. So because of crappy customer service, 3 stars"
Amanda C.,"Temecula, United States",148,423,33,5.0,16/6/2011,"I love, love, love, love, LOVE Cheesecake Factory. Wait. I don't think I expressed myself enough. I LOVE THE CHEESECAKE FACTORY!  Whew, okay. I got that off my chest.  There's two reasons why I adore this place. 1) They have the Godiva chocolate cheesecake which is pure heaven in your mouth (yeah, don't go there, you dirty minded folks) and 2) My father, the pickiest eater and biggest food complainer on the planet, shut up and ate his cheesecake.  That's some miracle working right there. They also have fried macaroni and cheese balls. They are delicious, but more importantly, they have Godiva chocolate cheesecake!"
Jimika G.,"Sacramento, United States",256,19,3,3.0,19/7/2012,Wait times are a hassle ! I came here for mother's day with my aunt and we had to wait an hour to be seated. There's always a line out the door for this place. The interior was nice and I like that they have outside seating.  I ordered a plate with some kind of stir fry ( dont remember the name ) but it was a pretty good portion and pretty delicious. I had leftovers to take home.  The bill was pretty expensive ...  the cheesecake prices are expensive . nothing much to brag about
J H.,"Austin, United States",40,2,,2.0,9/1/2014,"Ate here the other day, while the food was fairly good, there were some other issues.  Firstly, their soda mix was off, so the soda was flat and syrup-y, which as a person who enjoys soda, I found very annoying. I politely informed the waitress, but she did not seem to care. Secondly, the person who brought out the food, likely a manager of some sort, asked if I wanted ketchup and then brought some. It reminded me of the awful ketchup I had in middle school when the school tried to save money by buying canned generic ketchup and adding water to it.  These two issues may seem inconsequential to some people, but they are very important details to me. Details that make or break a dining experience."
