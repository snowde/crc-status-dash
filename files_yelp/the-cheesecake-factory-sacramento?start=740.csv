Janice C.,"San Francisco, CA",528,2174,5892,4.0,5/22/2009,"I drove by the Cheesecake Factory when I was in Sac the other day and this specific location has a soft spot in my heart.  That's because my bf and I had our ""first"" date over here back in 2006.  We met at Cheesecake Factory for drinks and a quick bite before our study session afterward at his place. I always order a Cosmo whenever I'm at cheesecake, coz they never make my drink less than satisfactory.  I couldn't seem to remember what I had for lunch though, but the cheesecake?  How could I forget that? Godiva chocolate cheesecake. Luscious. Divine. Creamy.  I remember wearing a blue dress that day.  I also remember the stain.  But it wasn't from the cheesecake.   ; - )"
Kaitlyn B.,"Reno, NV",0,13,1,3.0,8/9/2014,"After having been to many a Cheesecake Factory my expectations were set rather high. The quality of the food and the service had never disappointed me, until now. Upon arriving we had a short wait which was nice but once seated we tried to order and unfortunately they were out of the fried macaroni that goes on the macaroni and cheese burger we tried to order. Who knows the circumstances that allowed this to happen so we were gracious and looked for something new to try. The americano burger was alright but nothing compared to our usual order of the mac and cheese burger. My personal favorite the crispy chicken costaletta is usual so spectacular I cannot wait to return and have it again. This time was a let down. While the food was still good it was not ""cheesecake factory quality"". Our server Shannon was attentive and very friendly, nothing to complain about there. We got desserts and they were very good. Overall I left bummed because my food didn't live up to the quality I had received at previous visits to cheesecake factory.  We will not be revisiting this location again but still want to give other locations a chance."
Brandi W.,"Paradise, CA",1,4,1,4.0,7/31/2014,Their cream of mushroom soup was wonderful. I also really enjoyed the chicken salad sandwich. I had Renee's special. It was a lot of food. It was also 1/2 off cheesecake slices.
Heather T.,"Huntington Beach, CA",4,2,1,2.0,12/4/2013,"Worst server ever! Only came by to check on us once, and then a second time to make sure we wanted cheesecake! And cheese wasn't melted on the burger, no mayo or sauce on it either!"
Joe Y.,"Elk Grove, CA",263,199,1570,5.0,3/15/2012,The name says it all!!!!   Cheesecakes galore!!   Overly generous slices and deeeeelicious!!!!!
Marie N.,"Sacramento, CA",317,272,129,4.0,5/16/2011,"Cheesecake Factory is kind of hit or miss for me.  The last time I went (to the Roseville location) I had a disappointing experience with food and drinks. I went to dinner with a few friends on Friday, and this time the experience was great!  We got a table for 4 at 7:30 and had barely a 10 minute wait, which was kind of miraculous judging from the packed parking lot and people waiting to be seated in front of us.  Drinks and food were also prompt and normally you have to wait a while because everyone is trying to get through the ginormous menu.  For appetizers we ordered: Avocado Eggrolls (very tasty) Spicy Ahi Tempura Roll (UH-MAZING! My favorite!  Definitely recommend getting this for an appetizer!) Crispy Crab Wontons  (Good but nothing special, however the sauce that came with it was killer!) Vietnamese Shrimp Summer Rolls (Average) I took a friend's recommendation and ordered the Mahi Mahi Mediterranean for my entree and I was so far from disappointed!  Tender fish on top of creamy red mashed potatoes, topped with warm tomatoes and a fresh basil sauce drizzled over everything.  It was outstanding!   My sister had to send back her dish because it was a bit on the cold side, and she felt a little bad.  Our server was totally apologetic and polite about it though.  A manager even delivered a fresh replacement dish to her and the 2nd time around it was amazing.   I wish I could remember our server's name because she was really gave spot-on service.  This CF is definitely a place I'll be coming back to."
Nga P.,"Alameda, CA",237,327,743,3.0,2/2/2012,"The cheesecake factory is only known for one thing, and that is only their CHEESECAKE. This place is only good if you want to go on a romantic first date. dim lighting and music in the background makes you feel that this place is fancy. However, the food is only okay. Over priced food."
Eirika H.,"Los Angeles, CA",332,247,26,5.0,6/29/2011,"Chose take out, and LOVED it! They even give you free bread, and the food appeared to be just as good as eating it there.  highly recommended for in dining and take-out."
Steve L.,"San Mateo, CA",833,684,1066,4.0,3/21/2011,"This review is for take out only!  Our girls' competition didn't end until 9:30 that Saturday evening. It was too late for us to go out for dinner, and we didn't feel like staying up and waiting for a table. We decided to head back to our hotel (Doubletree, Sacramento) and just unwind and relax from the day's activities.  Still, I was hungry, and wanted something to eat. Used my Yelp app on my iPhone to see what was nearby, there was a Cheesecake factory listed. I asked my family if they wanted anything to go from CF, and they did. Also called our the other family we were traveling with, and also wanted to me to get something for them.  Pretty straightforward. Call them up and place your order. After waiting the allowed preparation time, waited at a specially-designated parking spot for to go orders. Called the front desk to tell them I was there, and they came by with my orders. They took my credit card, and later returned for me to sign.  Pretty painless.  We ordered:  -Two Cobb salads: can't comment, it was for our friends, but each was a sizable portion.  -Four Cheese Pasta: My oldest daughter's favorite. Penne pasta with mozzarella, ricotta, romano and parmesan, marinara sauce and basil. Came with a side of garlic bread. True to CF, this was a pretty large portion. Still hot from my pick up, and good.  -CF Club: Nicely arranged in the take out container. Turkey, bacon, lettuce, tomatoes, and mayo. Came with side of fries. Sandwich was nice and moist, and yes, very big. Can't say much about the fries, because the kids ate them all before I could take a bite.  -Key Lime cheesecake: couldn't resist, had to get dessert. Slightly tart, refreshing, yet so smooth and rich.  The Cheesecake Factory's to go service came to the rescue that night. No grumbling tummies before we went to bed."
Kacie Y.,"Alameda, CA",96,113,138,4.0,3/17/2012,"The waiters and waitresses are pretty friendly.  It's a bit dark when you sit down since the lights are dim.  The prices can be up to $20 per person, so you can split a dish if it's too expensive.  The portions are pretty big though :] I usually get the Miso Salmon or the Shrimp with Angel Hair Pasta.  Both are really yummy. Oh! And don't forget to get their cheesecake too ;] I'm usually not a fan of red velvet, but it was better than I thought.  The Oreo Cheesecake is reallyyyy good too. Did I mention I like cheesecake?  For a place to splurge on eating, I'd rather come here than BJ's.  It's a bit more family friendly and I think the service is more friendly as well."
Suzy B.,"Sacramento, CA",67,17,3,5.0,6/2/2014,"THE BEST FOOD IN SACRAMENTO. Everything I have tried here is Fabulous! Chicken Picatta, Shepherds Pie, Orange Chicken, Herb Crusted Salmon, Chopped Salad, etc. The food is fresh, yummy and the portions are generous. I love the ambience, Smooth Jazz, good service and quality food. The Mojitos are great too. Oh, and the cheesecake selection and taste are tops. My fav- White Chocolate Macadamia Nut. I've been to C.F. in Chicago and it doesn't compare.  This place is a jewel!"
Kari D.,"Seaside, CA",10,108,12,5.0,7/18/2011,"I love the Cheesecake Factory. I love ALL the Cheescake Factories actually.I have eaten at the one in Vegas, Palm Springs, Sacramento, and San Jose. But my review is for specifically this location.  I was here last Friday night. As usual the wait times are extremley long, but it was I think, 7:30 p.m and the hostess told us it would be 15-20 min. Cool. It was just the two of us so thats probably why. We made a way to the bar and it was definately busy but we found a spot. The bartender was super nice and the drinks were AMAZING. I ordered the passionfruit mojito and my boyfriend ordered some kind of peach smoothie type drink. I admit, I have never ordered alcohol when I come here, my favorite is the passion fruit ice tea and the boyfriend gets the strawberry lemonade. But after tasting their real drinks, I am now questioning why I haven't ordered them before.  Our little buzzer thing buzzed and we were sat promptly, we got sat in a booth inside and it was pretty private. I normally sit outside but we were hungry so we chose best available. We ordered the artichoke cheese dip as an appetizer and waited to order our dinner. The boyfriend ordered the gumbo and I ordered my favorite Pasta Da Vinci. And we ordered a side of sweet pototoes just cause we like them lol.  Service was pretty good, the waitress probably could have been friendlier but she was still on point and had everything we requested, even when she went on her break, we got a replacement waistress and she was really nice and friendly and was very prompt as well.  Now the best part...the Cheescake!!! We ordered ours to go, because we had so much food we couldn't eat all of it, so when we went back to our room and just rested, an hour later we dove right in. We orderd the one that wasn't on the menu, the Pina Colada. Let me tell you it was the BEST cheesecake I have tasted from here, it seriously surpassed all the previous Cheesecake Factory experiences, it was that good. It had a like pineapple cheescake filling with a custard and a coconut cake, it was DIVINE and NOT overwhelming at all. As I am typing this, I am fantasizing about it now, lol.  Overall, always a great experience at the Cheesecake Factory :)"
Jennifer W.,"Milpitas, CA",329,223,214,2.0,5/26/2011,"i've been to this Cheesecake Factory a few times and its either a hit or a miss.  The service was good.  we had a table of 10 and we were seated in 15 minutes. Then we had 2 more added to our party and seating was perfectly fine. We were given bread, butter, and water. the brown bread (i forgot what its called) is DELICIOUS!!   i ordered from their 'SPECIAL"" menu tonight and the other time too. it was ehhh. tonight, i ordered some kind of steak and chop. i forgot the name, but it was on their separate menu it was $13.90. it said it was similar to their Angus steak, but uhh it was so NOT! it came with string beans and mash potato, and mushrooms.  FIRST bite of the mash potato-- HELLA SALTY! omg.. then i took a bite of the 'steak' and it was HELLA more SALTY than the mash potato. my friend who ordered the salmon that came with the mash potato said it was SALTY too. i felt like i was eating a spoonful of salt. -___- i was so thirsty. the ONLY clear tasting not too salty was the string beans.  the other time i ordered from their 'SPECIAL' menu-- it was some pasta plate.. OH DEAR GOD.. it was HELLLAAA OILY and SALTY! ugh! the name sounded so good, but when it came out i was like GOD! so gross! i am NEVER gonna order from their 'SPECIAL' menu ever again. -- especially from this location. i had so many bad experiences.. the other time i ordered the Angel Hair with Shrimp - $16.90. the shrimps were huge, but there was still the fishy/seafood smell from it. ughh! and the pasta was hella oily. O_O i really dont know why. =/ i felt really sick from all the oil it had in it. their cheesecake is delicious and really FATTENING! i got the ultimate red velvet cheesecake -$7.95 HELLA EXPENSIVE! but its HELLAA DELICIOUS! i think after a few bites is MORE than enough for me! and save the rest for later! i should have really complained and told them about it since i was paying for the quality of the food. ehh i dont know why i didnt?! -_- our bill was messed up. they charged us 3 draft beers instead of 2. and 1 non-existent ice tea O_O we got it fixed so it was cool. overall, this place is very pricey and fancy.  it is a good place for a special occasion to celebrate."
Jim P.,"Roseville, CA",2,46,2,2.0,3/30/2015,"I may fall asleep while waiting. 2:25 in the afternoon. 10 minutes to get seated with my 93 year old mother. Ordered and still waiting at 3:12. No crowd, just slow service!"
Vicky Q.,"Sacramento, CA",68,153,264,4.0,3/3/2012,"Cheesecake factory is one of the best places for chain restaurants. I don't think there's been a time that I did not like my food. It's probably because everything has so much butter and oil that it has to be good but at least it's not disgusting food. I've had almost one of every kind of food from pasta, chicken, burger, steak, to cheesecake. Their cheesecake really is good but I feel like they have cut down their slices in the past few years. For $7-9 a slice I'd want a good size slice. Anyways service is usually good, wait is usually long but food is pretty good."
Sam R.,"Orangevale, CA",4,130,2,4.0,3/24/2015,"Never been a huge fan of this chain restaurant, have had a few different items in the past and they have been good, not great, but today I had the Seared Tuna Tataki Salad, which was really good and also it was low on the carbs.  A lot of pieces of tuna and a lot of salad so the dish is filling.   $18 for that menu item.  Service was good."
Tiffany D.,"Sacramento, CA",32,44,67,4.0,3/1/2014,"I always like coming here, but I just the wait to get a table. There is no call ahead or reservations. Portions here is always big, so really, you can share or order the smaller plates.  They give you bread, so don't overstuffed on bread. You must get their tropical fruit iced tea. I love it. Services can be great or lousy, however food is always decent. The environment can get real loud, so don't expect to have  a nice peaceful dinner if you wanted one. One factor to know that, you must at least try the cheesecake, even if it's not at the restaurant, you can always take it home. They have so much variety!"
Tim H.,"Elk Grove, CA",22,62,9,2.0,9/9/2011,"I always hope the food here tastes better the next time. But I always disappoint myself. Blah blah and more blah.  The place is not bad, just the food. Which defeats the whole purpose of the restaurant idea. The staff is really cool and nice. I like them. The decor and place itself is beautiful. Settling yet a bit of spunk to it. Then comes the food. The portions are humongous...HUGE. Seriously, this is the reason why Americans are so huge...besides laziness, McDonalds, snacking, no exercise, and other stuff...but foreals the portions here are ridiculous. The best time to eat and go here is happy hour. Their lunch, ""smaller,"" portions are already bigger than most restaurants. The drink specials are really good here and appetizers are tasty as well.  Final Verdict: I started at 3 stars for this BLAH, yet popular place, but it got 1 star deducted because this place assists in American obesity. Like everyone here, I blame restaurants for making me fat. That was extreme sarcasm on both parts."
Ricky N.,"Sacramento, CA",480,355,92,4.0,3/11/2011,"You can never really go wrong with Cheesecake Factory. Their service is usually superb and perfect. They're quick, prompt and always at your attention.  If you don't like an entree they're always happy to take it back, you might feel a lil snobby though eeeeek. Their prices are high but they're portions are always huge!!! You will always have something ""to-go"" unless you've been starving yourself to be America's Next Top Model or something. I've never really had room for dessert because I'm pretty bloated towards the end of the meal. But I have had their cheesecake several times and it truly is DELICIOUS. You should come here for their Happy Hour, Mon-Fri 4pm-6pm! They have great appetizers for only $5 including: Cream Cheese Crab Wontons, Fried Calamari, Avocado Egg Rolls, and etc. And yes, I still went here the same week after we heard about the lil controversy at this location... concerning a certain waitress doing something inappropriate with a certain ice machine. We came back for the honey-wheat bread they serve!!"
Sarmad N.,"San Leandro, CA",468,288,145,3.0,1/13/2014,typical Cheesecake service and food. Everything was good and they accommodated our very large group. I am down grading them because it almost seemed like they forgot my order. I got my food almost ten minutes later than everyone else. The food was good and there were no other services issues. I felt really left out while everyone was eating and i was enjoying my water.

Tiffany D.,"Sacramento, United States",32,44,67,4.0,1/3/2014,"I always like coming here, but I just the wait to get a table. There is no call ahead or reservations. Portions here is always big, so really, you can share or order the smaller plates.  They give you bread, so don't overstuffed on bread. You must get their tropical fruit iced tea. I love it. Services can be great or lousy, however food is always decent. The environment can get real loud, so don't expect to have  a nice peaceful dinner if you wanted one. One factor to know that, you must at least try the cheesecake, even if it's not at the restaurant, you can always take it home. They have so much variety!"
Tim H.,"Elk Grove, United States",22,62,9,2.0,9/9/2011,"I always hope the food here tastes better the next time. But I always disappoint myself. Blah blah and more blah.  The place is not bad, just the food. Which defeats the whole purpose of the restaurant idea. The staff is really cool and nice. I like them. The decor and place itself is beautiful. Settling yet a bit of spunk to it. Then comes the food. The portions are humongous...HUGE. Seriously, this is the reason why Americans are so huge...besides laziness, McDonalds, snacking, no exercise, and other stuff...but foreals the portions here are ridiculous. The best time to eat and go here is happy hour. Their lunch, ""smaller,"" portions are already bigger than most restaurants. The drink specials are really good here and appetizers are tasty as well.  Final Verdict: I started at 3 stars for this BLAH, yet popular place, but it got 1 star deducted because this place assists in American obesity. Like everyone here, I blame restaurants for making me fat. That was extreme sarcasm on both parts."
Ricky N.,"Sacramento, United States",480,355,92,4.0,11/3/2011,"You can never really go wrong with Cheesecake Factory. Their service is usually superb and perfect. They're quick, prompt and always at your attention.  If you don't like an entree they're always happy to take it back, you might feel a lil snobby though eeeeek. Their prices are high but they're portions are always huge!!! You will always have something ""to-go"" unless you've been starving yourself to be America's Next Top Model or something. I've never really had room for dessert because I'm pretty bloated towards the end of the meal. But I have had their cheesecake several times and it truly is DELICIOUS. You should come here for their Happy Hour, Mon-Fri 4pm-6pm! They have great appetizers for only $5 including: Cream Cheese Crab Wontons, Fried Calamari, Avocado Egg Rolls, and etc. And yes, I still went here the same week after we heard about the lil controversy at this location... concerning a certain waitress doing something inappropriate with a certain ice machine. We came back for the honey-wheat bread they serve!!"
Sarmad N.,"San Leandro, United States",468,288,145,3.0,13/1/2014,typical Cheesecake service and food. Everything was good and they accommodated our very large group. I am down grading them because it almost seemed like they forgot my order. I got my food almost ten minutes later than everyone else. The food was good and there were no other services issues. I felt really left out while everyone was eating and i was enjoying my water.
