Merisa M.,"Sacramento, CA",294,140,56,4.0,1/12/2012,"I don't know what it is, but Cheesecake Factory is always my choice for date night!  Either it's the slightly classy ambience or the dimmed mood lighting, but something about it always keeps this place as one of my top eateries in Sacramento. During lunch time, I usually get the pasta lunch special where you can order a lunch sized portion of their select pasta dishes.  It's cheaper than dinner prices and I've never been able to finish a whole one by myself.  The cream sauce for their pasta dishes is simply divine, so whenver I go, I ALWAYS order the Fettucine Alfredo or the Pasta Carbonara.  What's really awesome about it is that I can change the type of pasta used int he dish.  The Pasta Carbonara is supposed to come with Spaghettini, but I prefer Penne pasta.  They change it, no problem, and there isn't any extra charge!  When I go for dinner, I usually order the same thing as lunch.  What can I say, I'm a creature of habit. The only difference, I've just started ordering cheesecake for dessert.  My preference, the Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake.  Oh.  Em. Gee!!!  AMAZING!! It's sweet, chocolatey goodness in my mouth! Granted, it is quite rich and I can never eat the whole thing in one sitting, so I always take it home and eat it for breakfast the next day! LOL!"
Lyddiebug M.,"Sacramento, CA",1,8,4,2.0,5/2/2014,"Food was great service was horrible. To start, when we got here we were told the wait would be 20 min, and we waited 46 min before being seated. After being seated, we didn't get greeted by a server for about 10 minutes. Our server was very inattentive, our waters were never refilled and she didn't check on us throughout our experience. She also placed our to go orders with our regular orders which caused it to come out before our food even came out. We spoke with a manager who was very friendly (thank you!) and took care of us after apologizing for the service.  Our servers name was Dymitria, who apparently has a good reputation in the restaurant, so maybe she was just having a bad day. If that was the case, she should've stayed at home."
Fidelity W.,"Kelseyville, CA",0,32,,4.0,6/8/2015,"We love this place!  My husband first introduced me to this place last year during our honeymoon, and now I look for one nearby every time we travel somewhere (we live over 2 hrs away from any major city).   We came back again this year and were definitely not disappointed.   The service is wonderful and the food is soooooo tasty, albeit a bit too salty for me.  They have the best lemon drops of any bar or restaurant I've ever been to.  All around a very good choice for dinner.  We will be back!"
Jessica C.,"Sacramento, CA",2,65,69,5.0,2/27/2014,"Absolutely love it here. The thai lettuce wraps are a must to try! I am also a huge fan of their calamari and fried mac & cheese. Definitely a great variety on the menu so everyone gets what they want. The portions are great as well. The waiters are very friendly, the bathrooms are always clean, and although the seating can be a little bit tight, I always leave satisfied with the service. The decor is amaaaaaazing. Perfect when it's dimmed at dinner time, it sets a very romantic mood if you're going on a date. Oh and they also have the most delicious strawberry lemonade that I have ever tasted. Definitely worth splurging here."
Karen D.,"Tracy, CA",8,32,2,4.0,2/1/2014,Atmosphere is lovely. Service was decent. Food was good. I would come back here again.
Kristen A.,"Elk Grove, CA",1,36,87,5.0,2/19/2014,"Great service and great food! Love the small bites section... I had the endive salad which I thought would be smaller, but it's a good size. Great vinaigrette and yummy blue cheese crumbles! I also opted for the soup of the day which was a creamy mushroom which was very decadent along with some of their warm bread on the table."
W. N.,"Orange County, CA",34,283,4,4.0,11/16/2013,Great happy hour and as always:  I can be in San Diego.  I can be in Sacramento.  I can expect Cheesecake Factory to be there when I need a comfort food thing with  a nice glass of wine!
Remi P.,"Sacramento, CA",1,5,,1.0,5/25/2015,"Normally my husband and I have had really good service, but today was terrible. We asked for a iced tea and got a coke, ordered the macaroni and cheese burger but they were out of fried macaroni. We waited over 25 min just to get bread. My husband ordered pasta and it had 2 types of noodles inside. Just the overall experience was poor compared to the others. Seriously contemplating on coming back to this location."
Patrick H.,"Sacramento, CA",93,113,79,3.0,1/2/2014,"Best generic food place. If you must go to a chain generic food restaurant, this is the place to go. The decor is pretty cheesy like most other Cheesecake Factories but food is predictable and usually not bad. You will undoubtedly be invited here at some point for someone's birthday celebration so when you do get invited, just be glad it was to here and not some place like Applebee's or Olive Garden."
Michelle B.,"Oroville, CA",0,16,2,3.0,7/28/2011,"My girlfriend and I came here on a Monday at around 8:30 PM and were immediately greeted by the hostess. She was very very sweet. She asked us for our names and then our preference of a booth or a table. We then were seated right away.  We were greeted by our server within three to five minutes. He seemed nice, but slightly casual and for the most part, was inattentive. He took our drink and food order, checked on us once during our main course, and then presented us with the check--all of the actual food delivery and other checkbacks were performed by other servers. Also, at one point, he spoke loudly about how much money he had made with another co-worker (a little bit unprofessional). As far as the food, it was above average. Not extraordinary, but definitely good. The Artichoke, Crab and Cheese Dip was a great small plate for sharing and tasted great--with big chunks of roasted artichoke. My girlfriend's main course, the Baja Chicken Tacos, was really really good! If you like Mexican food, this dish actually tastes pretty authentic! My main course, the Mahi Mahi Mediterranean, was good; but I was disappointed in the portion size. The amount of garnish on my plate compared to actual edible fish was maybe 3:1. But, what was there, tasted good. NOTE: I noticed this location was rather small compared to other Cheesecake Factory restaurants I've been to. My advice would be to visit on a weeknight after 8:00 PM. I can imagine a one to two hour wait being in place on a Friday or Saturday night during dinner hour. Overall, this Cheesecake Factory is worth checking out--especially after a long day of shopping at Arden Mall!"
Rexelle S.,"Stockton, CA",49,29,,4.0,12/3/2011,"No reservations. Came here at night and it was packed! (Front Desk) Service was horrible. They gave us a pager, when it turned off, we went in. The hostess told us to stand on the side and wait to be assisted. 3 other people behind us got called while we were still waiting. We asked again when will we be called and the hostess gave this BS lie saying ""Oh someone did call you but because it's so loud I guess there was a miscommunication. Sorry about that, It'll be another 15 mins."" Mind you, we already waited 30 mins. with our pager. Anyway, we finally were called a little less than 15 mins. and were seated at a booth. (If you haven't been to a Cheesecake Factory, they have a REALLY dim atmosphere. So if you're not into the eating in the dark business, you shouldn't visit any Cheesecake Factories) The food *and cocktails; however, are really good. I'm no regular, but I've made a good amount of visits to be able to rate the quality and quantity of their meals and drinks. **For appetizers, I recommend either the lettuce wrap or the avocado rolls **For a meal, I don't have any specific recommendations just because it depends on your taste, although, those that I've tried (and may not completely remember the names) have been delicious. I do remember having some kind of pasta and some type of sandwich and burger. **For cocktail, my favorite is Georgia Peach! It's a refreshing and fun ""special"" smoothie ;) **For dessert, Cheesecake is obviously the way to go. I personally like the white chocolate macadamia cheesecake and the tuxedo cheesecake. Oh! and I LOVE the bread and butter they serve as you order and wait! One time I went with my cousins for some drinks. They ordered a quick appetizer to snack on while I enjoyed the *free*, warm bread and butter :) ... If you want to finish your meal without having to take the rest to go, you shouldn't have the bread just because it's addicting and really fulfilling...well, unless you have a strong and hungry stomach, go for it) The price range is okay (~$10-20 ish) but worth the meal.  Enjoy!"
Kathleen F.,"Beaverton, OR",34,49,,4.0,6/2/2013,"I am never disappointed with the good ole' Cheesecake Factory! I have never had a dish I didn't love to pieces. My Favorites are the Mac 'n' Cheese Burger and the Chicken Chipotle Pasta. Off all the chain restaurants, they have the best waitresses (Who actually know the menu) and alcoholic beverages(I would rather come here and pay $12 for a fantastic Pina Colada than crappy Apple Bees). Desserts are of epic proportions, I have had their cheesecake(original and dulce de leche) and the Godiva Chocolate Brownie(Wonderful!). The Cons: Price and Waiting time I think anytime you go to the Cheesecake factory on the weekends or special holiday, you are going to have to wait.........there is no way of getting around it, its how the cookie crumbles. I have never had their brunch but I wouldn't even attempt to go wait for it(the wait is pretty long on sunday mornings). Its no better at the Roseville locations either, so dont even attempt to drive the extra 15 minutes to think it will be ""faster""....because it won't. The price is pretty outrageous, for 3 adults to eat, this includes :one appetizer, 3 entrees, 3 standard beverages, 3 desserts and tip will run about $110. Add in alcoholic beverages, you are looking close to $140! BUT, If you are anything like me and only eat out a couple times a year, you want quality food that is going to satisfy you and this place hits the spot. I have never left here feeling like I threw away money like at other major chain restaurants, because of the quality your are getting....nothing beats it. If you have never been here you are missing out....get yourself over and try their cheesecake....IT FLIPPING AWESOME!!! I would give 5 star but I had to take one off for the wait time :("
Jonathan H.,"El Dorado, CA",0,28,,2.0,3/25/2012,"eh.. This place is alright i suppose. quality of food is relatively low. We have gone here several times, as my wife loves the Madera Chicken- However typically everything i try is there cold or flavorless.  The service at this particular cheesecake factory definitely leaves much to be desired! This place is way overpriced for the quality of service and of the food."
Sarah D.,"Rocklin, CA",1,4,,4.0,4/29/2014,Cheesecake Factory next to the Galleria Mall is great fun and delicious food. The staff are friendly and the portions are very big. Would recommend sharing with a friend. Overall great restaurant.
Rod W.,"Sacramento, CA",7,280,93,2.0,7/17/2013,"This place is good if you like chicken 50 different ways. If you really look over the menu there isnt much choices except chicken, chicken and chicken. Where are the steaks, braised short ribs or even pork chops? I would only go for the appetizers and deserts thats all. The service is ok but you usually have ro ask for refills. Many other places to eat that has more than just chicken."
Debbie J.,"Pacific Grove, CA",0,20,2,5.0,4/28/2015,"We came here for dinner after a busy day at the Capitol. From arrival to check payment, nothing needed improvement.  We had a great server, Rosanne, and the food was simply delicious!!  My husband had the spaghetti & meatballs - tasted like the best Italian home cook's recipe.  I had the chicken Costoletta - thinly sliced chicken breast, breaded and sautéed to a crisp golden brown. Served with asparagus and red potato mash.  Every bite wonderful!!  Thank you for operating such a great restaurant!!  Wished we lived closer."
Olivia L.,"Sacramento, CA",1757,364,73,4.0,11/2/2010,"I kind of feel this is the Target of restaurants. Pretty much anything you want, you kind find here and it's decent to good quality. It's been a long time since I've been here and even though the menu seems to have changed, the size of it hasn't.  The service was prompt and friendly and of course the interior is quite remarkable, even if it is a chain. I think it's my favorite chain restaurant. Though they could definitely use to index their menus or provide some kind of cliff notes version for those of us on a time crunch.  Also, you need to fix your Nutrition guide book with all of the calories because you clocked a salad at 1600. Ex squeeze me? (Not easily after eating a few of those.)"
Eileen T.,"Redwood Valley, CA",0,19,,2.0,7/15/2014,"I don't know what I expected, since it was my first visit, but it was nothing what I thought it would be like.  My husband and I stopped in for lunch before heading over to Arden Fair Mall.  We were seated right away and our waitress was friendly.   The menu is HUGE and so it took us a long time to decide what to order.  We just wanted a small, late lunch since we were having a big dinner that night.  That made it even more difficult to choose.  My husband order the lunch pizza and salad.  It was a 10"" pizza and nice size side salad.  I order two appetizers for my entree ( Pretzel Chicken and what I thought was Flat Bread).  I was expecting a Naan type of baked flat bread, but what I got was a huge chunk of french bread that was over oily.  When I mentioned this to the waitress, she assured me I had order french bread.  I was not in the mood to argue with her, but this aggravated me.  She made no attempt to make this correct or to even acknowledge that there was a mistake.  The pretzel chicken was fabulous and I would go back to have this again.  It was 4 chicken tenders on skewers crusted in crushed pretzels and fried. Served with honey mustard dipping sauce.   I was surprised and aggravated when the bill for LUNCH was $50.  One lunch special, two appetizers, an ice tea, and tonic and lime was $50.  WOW!!!"
Kilifi F.,"Sacramento, CA",23,19,3,5.0,11/18/2013,"I love this restaurant. The staff is friendly compared to the Valley Fair location in the South Bay. Food is great, the wait staff is friendly and attentive. Unfortunately, I would hate for them to receive any rude customers. Anyhow, I like to try a lot on their menu but my favorite is THE FRIED SHRIMP BATTER BASKET. They have the best batter I have ever tasted but the cole-slaw comes third place (first goes to the CAFE at Thunder Valley). Great place for date night or girls night out."
Kelly S.,"Rocklin, CA",9,10,2,2.0,2/18/2012,"I came with 4 friends for a birthday dinner and were so burnt out by the end, we didn't even order the cheesecake.   The food was Meh.  Chicken was chewy in the pasta dish, the steak was tough and the spaghetti with meat sauce was way to greasy.  Our spinach dip appetizer was good, but we were long finished with it before we saw our food because the service was so slow.   We told the waiter we weren't happy with the food, and even though he was polite about it, didn't offer to fix anything.  Then it took over 45 minutes after we were eating to get the check after requesting it twice.  Overall - slow and inattentive service. On a positive note, I spoke with the manager and he did comp our appetizer. I think I would go back again, but only when I feel like spending $8 on a slice of cheese cake.  Would definitely skip the food at this location."

Kelly S.,"Rocklin, United States",9,10,2,2.0,18/2/2012,"I came with 4 friends for a birthday dinner and were so burnt out by the end, we didn't even order the cheesecake.   The food was Meh.  Chicken was chewy in the pasta dish, the steak was tough and the spaghetti with meat sauce was way to greasy.  Our spinach dip appetizer was good, but we were long finished with it before we saw our food because the service was so slow.   We told the waiter we weren't happy with the food, and even though he was polite about it, didn't offer to fix anything.  Then it took over 45 minutes after we were eating to get the check after requesting it twice.  Overall - slow and inattentive service. On a positive note, I spoke with the manager and he did comp our appetizer. I think I would go back again, but only when I feel like spending $8 on a slice of cheese cake.  Would definitely skip the food at this location."
