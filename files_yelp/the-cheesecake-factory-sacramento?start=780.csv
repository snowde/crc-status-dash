Keni B.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",0,6,5,1.0,3/1/2015,"Today, I only ordered a slice of cheesecake with my whip cream on the side , however, when my whip cream and cheesecake were brought out my whip cream was sitting in a dirty dish that blatantly had soiled crumbs in and around it as well as it resting on my slice of cheesecake. I asked the waitress if I could get a new slice of cheesecake on a new dish. At first, she only returned with a new dish of whipped cream, I asked if I could get, yet again , a new slice of cheesecake given that the original slice had the nestled up against the soiled dish in the first place. As if my order was so complicated, she finally took the original slice of cheesecake back, only to return with that same slice of cheesecake but now on a different plate. Frustrated, I told the waitress that this was the same slice of cheesecake she told me no it was not. Unbenounced to her I had created a dent in the same slice of cheesecake with my fork to see if they would actually give me the same slice of cheesecake prior. Nonetheless I sent it all back . How hard was it for her to just get me a whole new slice of cheesecake on a new dish?"
Sarah H.,"Kansas City, KS",155,307,36,4.0,1/28/2013,I only come here for cheesecake and the avocado egg rolls. Got the Carmel white chocolate Macedonian nut cheesecake which was uber delicious.
Lili Z.,"Elk Grove, CA",13,103,,3.0,5/19/2013,"I went here for valentines day. They are super busy, we had to wait like 10 minutes in order to be seated. But that wasn't that bad. It was an enjoyable experience. Servers are nice, and provided excellent service. The only thing that knocks down two stars is the prices. But the dishes are delicious and the cheesecake is tooooooooooooooooooooooooo die for here. :) Yummy. the pineapple upside down cheese cake whatever it is called is super yummy. but it was pricey $6 a slice. :( but it was delicious. this is a place where you should go on special occasions only because it is pricey. I know this is a late review since I was there on valentines day date. It was me and my boyfriend's first time coming here. But overall good experience. :)"
Jay A.,"Camino, CA",7,89,,4.0,9/18/2011,"Have heard mostly good things about the Cheesecake Factory from friends and family, and finally got around to trying it out this afternoon for lunch. In a word...YUM! I had the Crispy Chicken Costoletta, and it was simply scrumptious. I'm a big bell-beefer of a guy, and the portion size made me giggle and blush like a teenage school girl. Yes, the food is pricy, but good lord man, look how much you're getting!!! Tragically, I didn't have room to try any cheesecake, and taking a piece with me didn't sound appealing at the time. Oh, regret!  The one down side? Expect a bit of a wait. The place makes you feel like you're trying to eat out in Roseville on a Saturday night. The entrance is jam-packed with people waiting for a table, and you have to snake your way through this sea of 98.6 degree cologne to get to the check-in counter. Based on my experience, I'm failing to see an explanation for negative reviews."
Mandie F.,"Sacramento, CA",528,180,214,4.0,8/23/2010,"""Where is that thing you are going to order?"" ""It's on page 12."" (both of us burst into laughter) Why is the menu so vast? Why are the portions so medieval? Why does most of it taste so good? I broke down and ordered the salmon, because quite frankly they didn't have anything very appealing as far as vegetarian options go, and I haven't really been against incorporating some fish slowly back into my diet. I will probably go another 6 months before eating meat again though. ANYWHO... We ordered the avocado egg rolls --- I HIGHLY recommend these. They are warm and flavorful (kind of guacamole-ish? but not? just tasty so order them) and there is a really nice cilantro cashew (?) dipping sauce that comes with it. At least that's what the waitress was mumbling. Honestly I was full after that and the bread. We felt bad though and ordered entrees anyway.  I ordered the barbecue salmon off the ""Special Menu"" for 14.95 and it was pretty impressive. You get a lot of food for the price and it really doesn't seem like a rip off. The salmon was grilled with a basic barbecue sauce on it, and it came with a corn, red pepper, and zucchini salad underneath, with smashed red potatoes which were VERY tasty. The salmon was topped with some thinly sliced onion rings. Those were kind of bland, so I was dipping them in the sauce that came with the egg rolls.  My date ordered the fish tacos, there were three of them which were HUGE and had cabbage, cilantro, onions, lime and sauce spilling off the top. It came with standard Spanish rice, black beans, guacamole and pico de gallo.  I ate painful forkful by painful forkful, and barely got through a quarter of it before deciding to box it up. My date started to go into a food coma at the table, and his eyes were like half-open and one was starting to go to the side, so I decided we should probably leave and go take a nap. That is exactly what we did."
Julie P.,"Stockton, CA",15,23,1,4.0,1/26/2013,"I took some friends out for a late lunch yesterday. Food was delicious, and portions were large enough that we took half home for dinner. My salmon was perfect, and the banana cream cheesecake was divine. Service was a little slow, but we did arrive at the end of the lunch rush. We'll be back!"
Len F.,"Carmichael, CA",0,13,,5.0,1/12/2015,"We have been to the cheesecake factory numerous times for brunch, lunch and dinner. We just love this restaurant. The decor is pretty, they have plenty of menu choices, the food and desserts are fantastic, and the service is great.  Plus, the portion sizes are really large and the prices are reasonable for what you get. Really what more can you ask for. That's why its usually crowded at the CF."
Meghan R.,"Santa Cruz, CA",77,239,65,3.0,2/21/2011,"I am trying very hard not to base my review on my dislike of chain restaurants. They have a place in this world and it seems, along with my mother, a lot of folks in this area agree. This place was packed at 3 PM on a Saturday afternoon.  The staff were helpful with my mother being disabled and though our waitress was given a table of 10 not long after we were seated, she still managed to be attentive.  I got the chicken piccata, bleh. the sauce tasted like mayonnaise. Not lemoney enough.  My mom got some small plates and was totally stoked on that. If I return, i am going that route too. prices were about $4.50 for each small plate and if you got 3 to split with somebody you would both leave happy."
Jessica H.,"Orangevale, CA",299,399,213,3.0,10/21/2010,"Parking is super busy but completely expected for a place near the mall sharing a parking lot. I'd opt for the valet service. Cheesecake Factory's are pretty standard. HUGE portions. Drinks are pretty expensive. It's a good chain restaurant and they have a ton of different food options as well as...... well, cheesecake,"
Miles C.,"Sacramento, CA",125,114,24,3.0,11/15/2010,"The food here is very tasty and the variety is stellar.  In fact the variety here is a bit of a negative for me.  The nearly dozen pages of menu is densely packed with short descriptions and a myriad of choices that make it hard to remember what on page 3 piqued your interest when you are on page 9. They have a pretty serious bar menu which is full of seriously overpriced booze that I've never ordered.  Might be a great place for drinks, I wouldn't know. The decor is outlandish and absurd but in a way that really makes it feel like something out of Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium.  There are a lot of styles and textures and pillars and wow all over.  I find it magical at times and over the top at others (depends on my mood I guess).  What can't be denied is the place has a real sense of identity. It's the only place in town that serves White Chicken Chili which while tasty is nothing at all to do with chili.  It's also the only place in town I've seen goulash on a menu.  It's nto as good as my hungarian grandmother's family recipe but for a place not run by a 74 year old gypsy woman, it's pretty damn good.  I've tried a number of things here and seldom been disappointed (The Carbonara was pretty meh).  That said for the prices they charge it damn well better be good. There isn't a thing on the menu that is less than 7.50 and tracking down a meal less than 12.00 is a chore.  Everything in here is half a price point above a normal chain restaurant like Chili's or Applebee's and while the style here says ""posh"" it can also read ""Full of itself"" and not be wrong on either count. I like the place, my girlfriend loves the place.  I think it's overpriced but I also think it has the best variety in town.  If the servers were consistently awesome (they are generally hit and miss) and the prices were a little less crazed (7.50 is too much for even tasty cheesecake) I would love the place."
Blake C.,"CA, CA",252,282,64,5.0,1/10/2011,"This place is always good! Sometimes the wait can be up to 2 hours, but it well worth the wait. From the time you walk in, your greeted and treated like a valued customer. When seated, your given menus and drinks and bread. My favorite is the brown bread.  Any appetizer here is sure to please! When it comes to an entree, the menu is like a mini novel, with tons of good choices. I'm a huge pasta fan, and I often go with the Pasta DaVinci. Never have I had a better made pasta with chicken than this dish. And it has always been made the same way, and always tastes great! And of course desert... Cheesecake anyone? I'm not a big fan, but there are many other choices for those who may not want cheesecake. All in all, good price for the amount of food you get. Great place for family or dates or watching sports at the bar.  Definitely TOP 5 restaurants in my book!"
George M.,"Antioch, CA",171,52,,2.0,12/11/2012,"Outdoor seating. In the dark. No lighting. Can't see or read menu. The fascination with eating outside, in a parking lot...beyond me. Order not right. No offer to comp with dessert discount or no charge for coffee,etc. Normally a very good, if noisy, experiemce. This time? Nah......"
Eric F.,"San Leandro, CA",743,2526,266,4.0,1/29/2011,"Yet another go-to dinner spot during my UCD years, CF's Arden Way branch always got the job done nicely - consistently good food and service.  Whether it's the Jambalaya pasta, Chicken Bellagio, Louisiana Chicken pasta or the Herb-crusted salmon, I always left stuffed and satisfied =D  If you're even remotely health-conscious however, I'd probably stick to the salads or split anything on the remainder of the menu with a friend."
Kyle F.,"Carmichael, CA",559,44,10,4.0,4/5/2013,I love the variety of food here. I can't believe how they continue to come up with new amazing dishes. I wish they took reservations or call ahead seating.
Alex G.,"Stockton, CA",21,33,9,4.0,10/16/2012,"Everytime I come to a Cheesecake Factory, my bank account cringes, my waistline hates me and my stomach is overcome with joyous emotions!! This is my favorite franchise, been to a few in LA, in Vegas, St. Louis and San Francisco, as well as this one. Excellent at all of them. They're pasta's are always pleasing, and their ""stuffed tortillas"" (otherwise known as tacos where I'm from) are actually pretty good. If you love spicy food like I do, you have to try the chicken chipotle pasta. Pure awesomness, no lie. ANd ofc ourse, the cheesecake. This is the murderer of all diets, because you just can't stop. I haven't had one bad cheesecake. Of course, I'm biased here, because I'm an equal opportunity lover when it comes to cheesecake, but still. Don't think about it, just do it, try thi splace!!"
M.K. F.,"Sacramento, CA",1,24,,4.0,3/7/2013,"Really good food.  Some of my favorites are the Hibachi Steak and Cajun Jambalaya Pasta.   Recently, I organized a group dinner for about 20 people.  I called to make reservations and there were certain restrictions.  Basically I wasn't able to make the reservation because of the day and time.  I would say that this was the only downside to my experience.  When we arrived, the hostess said that she remembered us calling a couple of days earlier to try and make reservations.  Despite not being able to make reservations, she said that they kept us mind while planning out the dinning area that night and they were able to seat us in 20 minutes (they had estimated that it would be a 45 minute wait). Since our group was large, we had 2 servers.  They were both friendly and attentive.  Prior to ordering, they asked if we would all like separate bills, which is a plus.  They kept all of our waters filled throughout the night and did a good job remembering who ordered what even though a few of us changed our seats.  Large groups can get annoying, especially when they start moving around or getting out of their seats (which we did) but the servers kept a smile on their face and made us feel very comfortable and welcome. It's hard to find restaurants that know how to handle large parties, but the Cheesecake Factory is one of them!"
