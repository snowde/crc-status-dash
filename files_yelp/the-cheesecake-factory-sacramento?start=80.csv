W. L.,"Sacramento, CA",0,35,13,4.0,7/26/2017,"A friend and I had lunch at this restaurant yesterday. The front desk was very efficient in arranging for a table for us. The waitress was also very efficient. I ordered a lunch-size salad. The ingredients were fresh, the portion was huge, and the dish tasted very good. I got the worth of the money spent.  As compared to the hostess at the front desk, our waitress was basically doing her job but her non-verbal communication conveyed a sense of unfriendliness in a very subtle manner. She did all the necessary actions, such as taking our orders, replacing a knife that was dirty to begin with and saying sorry about that, asking how we were doing every now and then even when the place was very busy. However, her facial expression and the way she spoke (sort of in a relatively cold manner) conveyed the unfriendly tone underneath. It  could be that, she was in a bad mood herself yesterday and this had nothing to do with us. I do not know whether she realized what her own non-verbal communication was saying to the customers or not. If she had been as friendly as the hostess, this dining experience would have been perfect! You want your customers to feel welcome all the way at your place."
Jamie C.,"Sacramento, CA",223,179,1139,4.0,4/10/2016,"I have been craving spaghetti and was excited to see they have a spaghetti dish on their menu! I ordered that and my friend got the Louisiana chicken pasta. The spaghetti was really good. Those meatballs are no joke! They were so big and so yummy. The Louisiana chicken pasta is actually one of my usual dishes here. My friend ended up ordering that and I got to have the best of both worlds! Lucky me. That crusted chicken in the pasta has so much flavor. Total yumminess! The pasta can feel pretty heavy though, sometimes. It's pretty greasy. Probably all that butter they use to cook it, but it's good. We also ordered the loaded potato tots. I thought the tots were going to be actual tots with toppings on top like a nacho, but they're actually mashed potato deep fried with bacon and cheese inside, served with sour cream on the side. They were good. I like anything potato and fried. ;) The complimentary bread is so good. They serve the wheat bread warm and butter just melts on top. I always try not to eat so much bread, so I have room for my food, but that never happens. Their dishes are really big too. My friend and I both didn't finish our dishes. And we felt we still had a full dish by the end of our meal. Two people could share a dish if they wanted.  They have really good cheesecakes. I always come here wanting a cheesecake at the end of my meal, but most of the time, I never have room for it! Depending on when you come, there can be quite a wait for a table. Overall, this place is good. Good food, complimentary bread, large entrees, and yummy cheesecakes."
Monique A.,"Pittsburg, TX",930,324,1175,5.0,3/14/2016,"I have always enjoyed coming here for dinner or lunch. They offer lunch portions and a skinny menu. Be prepared most items are very high in calories but I think that's the point when you come. Portions are very large and way too many options. Today I started with the Beets and goat cheese salad. This is always been my favorite. It's light not a heavy dressing and the portion is on the appetizer menu so it's perfect to start off before your main meal. I ordered the spicy cashew chicken over brown rice and it was a huge portion, I recommend that is big enough for two people if you're not that hungry or you want to eat light. The chicken to me wasn't that spicy may be a little bit more on the saltier side because of the sauce. The cashews were really crisp and the brown rice was really good too.  My son ordered the shrimp and sausage pasta, he said he would give it 8 out of 10. I tasted it it's not one of the best pastas for an Italian dish but certainly it's a hearty dish and not too bad.  Lastly we both ordered cheesecake, of course you cannot leave here without ordering one of the 25 + types of cheesecake they offer. We ordered the raspberry cheesecake and a Tiramisu cheesecake to go. I haven't tasted it yet but no doubt it's going to be really good. One cheesecake I would recommend that I've tried is the red velvet cheesecake, very high in calories I believe it's at 2100 cal but it's so good so share with somebody."
Jami N.,"Roseville, CA",415,400,416,5.0,8/10/2017,I enjoy coming here for dessert it always good very huge selection of cheesecakes to choose from and it always so good and yummy
Eric O.,"Vallejo, CA",0,7,1,5.0,10/17/2017,Had a fabulous dinner.  Took wife and family and completely enjoyed ourselves.  Met our cook Jorge who was very charming and explained how our dinner was prepared to perfection.  Will definitely return only when Jorge is working
Monica P.,"Sacramento, CA",168,21,6,2.0,12/6/2017,I usually come here just for drinks at happy hour but tonight I went in for a late dinner. I understand that they close at 11pm I didn't think coming In at 9:45pm would upset them . The server Luis m. Wasnt so happy with us at all throughout the whole entire night . I ordered the tomato basil pasta which was good and a good portion my friend ordered the enchiladas which was okay wasn't that great. After dinner we ordered 5 desserts To go 2 tiramisu cales 1 key lime pie 1 mango key lime and a salted caramel cheesecake. Although the server only came back with all but the salted caramel which I just let it go cause while waiting for the check I managed to finish the mango key lime pie (couldn't resist). The tiramisu cakes didn't look at all appealing therefore I returned it requesting for one that would look edible like the other desserts I got. And keep in mind I have ordered the tiramisu dessert before. He returned it back with the same exact cakes and this time the cakes were worst and it was just a mess in the box. So I walked over and ask politely to take it off my bill I didn't expect him to holler over to the pastry workers to point out Im the one who decline to his cake. I was in shocked I could not believe this server Luis m. Would point out loud and clear in front of me that I am the person who doesn't want the desserts.. I will think twice about coming back. I've never ever encountered such rude service like Luis M.
Ian A.,"Sacramento, CA",0,5,3,2.0,7/31/2017,"I have been a fan of the TCK establishment for a while. One of my favorite dishes is the Beef Pit Dip where at every location my Beef Pit Dip is served with the typical arrangement of sandwich and au jus dipping broth. I don't know why this location on Arden Way did not follow through with this and essentially offended me when asking for help. Upon receiving my To-Go order and checking the contents, I saw that the sandwich's namesake was missing from the order, the au jus, leaving me with a dry sandwich of bread and meat and cheese (NOT a french dip). I contacted the location and they said I could fight for a refund. I said I only wanted to just stop by and pick up my au jus dipping broth which is typically part and parcel of the ""french dip"" experience that I have come to know from The Cheesecake Factory. When I arrived, I was told to stand to the side and wait for my au jus. After 20-25 minutes of waiting, a waitress comes from the back and before walking towards me turns to some holier-than-thou manager types and they collectively give me a good look.  The waitress then approaches me with a small plastic container, say 1 ounce to 2 ounce condiment container with a brown liquid and says, ""Here is your au jus"".  1) I asked if customers of The Cheesecake Factory are to dip their Beef Pit Dip sandwich into this, she said yes. 2) I asked her why I couldn't have a small soup container with the au jus broth or french onion broth, she shrugged. 3) I asked her if this was the same broth, she said yes.  4) I asked her why the liquid was cold to the touch, she shrugged. Excited to receive my sandwich, I saw I was missing an integral part. When I contacted the establishment about this they said to fight for a refund; I offered to just pickup some au jus instead, which they agreed to. When I got to the location, I was told to wait 20-25 min and was studied by managers. When I received what I hoped was my au jus, it was a small 1-2oz container of cold brown liquid. I left the brown liquid with the waitress and returned to my dry ruined order 40 minutes later. Unfortunately, I have experienced better from The Cheesecake Factory. I really did like the location of this one."
Harold B.,"Indianapolis, IN",3,35,7,2.0,10/10/2017,"Tonight at CF was disappointing to me and my wife. Our server was rude and the food was mediocre.  My wife ordered a Bloody Mary and when she complained it tasted plain with little or no alcohol the waiter laughed. Not sure her name,  an older lady. Anyway, disappointed."
Jessica V.,"Sacramento, CA",60,21,6,1.0,6/21/2017,"Called at 4pm in advance for a pickup at 6pm.  2 hours advance notice.  Got there at 6:05 and staff said it would be another 20 minutes or so.  Thought they were just exaggerating a little bit and i was already here so i decided to wait. If i went elsewhere, the wait might be longer.  I didn't get my food till 6:25, that's 25 minutes after the time i specifically told them i wanted the food to be READY for pick-up. Tell me?  What is the point of calling in early when you have to end up waiting anyway.  Had a meeting at 6:30, and wanted to eat something before then but due to poor staff abilities, i showed up late and was not able to eat my food till later, around 7:30.  Bad bad experience, makes me think twice before putting anymore money into this establishment! **NOTE on another occasion i called for road side pick up, gave them info of the car i would be driving.  they said to call a certain number when i was ready outside,  After picking up the kids i was relieved to just drive up and pick up our food. Got there and gave them a call, said no you have to come in, AGAIN what is the point of giving me all these options and not falling through with it?? Makes no sense! Had to get out of my car with a bunch of kids, maneuver my way into the restaurant and grab my food.  If i did not have my kids with me, no problem, but i chose this option for a reason and Cheesecake Factory just couldn't pull through. SMH"
Cru L.,"Sacramento, CA",13,46,30,3.0,6/8/2017,I have had this place a lot lately do to business meetings with people that live outside of the state. The service was a little overwhelming. I was trying to have a normal conversation and our server kept coming over to us often asking if we needed anything. I like the hustle man but tone it back a notch.  The food was amazing. I will definitely be back
Misty T.,"El Dorado Hills, CA",268,141,215,5.0,5/28/2017,"My go-to when I don't know where else to eat. Their service is always on point. Food is always good. Staff is always friendly and the cheesecake is always bombdotcom. No issues with parking. If it gets too busy I'll pay $3.00 for valet. At times, the wait for a table can get crazy especially around dinner time so definitely plan ahead. I high recommend their tex mex eggrolls. My all time favorite thing on the menu. Price are reasonable for the type of restaurant it is. I will definitely be back."
Jackie E.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",96,9,2,5.0,1/10/2017,"I took my friend here for his birthday last  night. The service was exceptional. We were sat quickly, which was great after being told there would be a bit of a wait. Our server was attentive, keeping our glasses full and making sure we got what we wanted as quickly as possible.  The food was wonderful! I got the shrimp scampi and steak Diane. The shrimp were huge and it was all cooked perfectly. My friend got the chicken nachos. Delicious. We got one slice each of the lemon meringue and the salted caramel cheesecakes.  Their menu is on the pricey side but considering how much you get, along with the quality of both the food and the service, I didn't mind paying a little extra.  All in all, we both had a great experience. I'll be back soon!"
Jeanette H.,"Suisun City, CA",10,16,2,3.0,10/9/2017,"Unpon entering we stood in line at the host station. There seemed to be a disagreement between 2 guests and an employee. The staff did not acknowledge anyone standing in line. After that the less than friendly host asked us how many were in our party. We said 2 and he said go stand over there and pointed to an area next to the hostess station.  After we were shown to our seat things improved. We had a great server. We ordered and split a Greek salad ,chicken Medea, and a tiramisu cheesecake. Everything was delicious. I would differently return and order everything again. I just hope they do a better job of training their hosts."
Selena R.,"Stockton, CA",2,7,1,5.0,7/5/2017,Amazing Service! My waitress was extremely nice. I had the spicy chicken chipotle & it was delicious. The strawberry lemonade is a definite must try. I had no complaints. Very satisfied.
Maksim C.,"Palm Coast, FL",49,93,218,5.0,4/18/2017,"Came here a few times for lunch and they were good every time. I like their Steak Diane dish, very tasty. The service has been good every time I came here, staff is friendly, restaurant is nice and clean. I ordered their cheesecake while at restaurant and to go as well, it is absolutely awesome!!! Will definitely recommend this place. 5 stars..."
Erika S.,"Yuba City, CA",102,83,129,5.0,5/26/2017,"Must have when i come to Sacramento!! Have a nice lunch, dinner or just stop in for some delicious cheese cake, that alone always fills me up!! Last stop i tried the pork chops! They were to die for! Cooked perfectly!"
Courtney D.,"Crocker-Amazon, San Francisco, CA",399,100,80,5.0,10/27/2016,"GREAT SERVICE HERE. The waiter was so nice here. We had asked for bread, but it was still being made and he came to our table apologizing about 3 times that the bread wasn't ready. When we were leaving, we proceeded to ask for some bread to go and he gave us 5 loaves of bread. FIVE LOAVES. And he included butter and wrapped everything in foil for us. So kind."
Melissa P.,"Seattle, WA",575,132,113,5.0,8/1/2016,"I can't ever think of a time that I had a bad experience at Cheesecake Factory! Their food is delicious, affordable for the type of restaurant, and there is such a wide range of food options to choose from! In my opinion this is the perfect place for a romantic date night or a celebratory birthday dinner with friends and family!  I mean, you always start off on a good note here when the waiter brings you the delicious soft warm bread that you cannot help but indulge in. To be honest, I go through about 3 of those baskets before my meal even gets to me.  In regards to dishes, you really can't go wrong with any order here but just in case you'd like recommendations, my favorites include: the factory burrito grande and the spicy chipotle chicken pasta. I recently had the egg roll sampler appetizer for the first time and that was delicious too! Ps if you get the factory burrito grande prepare to come VERY HUNGRY! Or you can also take it home and eat it for the next 2 meals. A lot of the dishes are pretty big and I almost always take home leftovers Now comes dessert, because that's obviously the main reason everyone comes here!!! Bring on the cheesecake!!! My favorites are the s'mores cheesecake, the salted caramel cheesecake, and the red velvet one! But truthfully, you really can't go wrong with any of them. Especially not on national cheesecake day when they are half off!!"
Monica B.,"Sacramento, CA",6,10,20,1.0,2/5/2017,"Here is a breakdown of my to go order experience during a Saturday night. 10:07 PM Called in to make a pick up order. I was transferred and put on hold to make an order after a 2 minute wait. The order taker asked what I wanted, my name, and gave me the price to pay. I got the Cuban sandwich order with fries. The representative didn't tell me how long it's going to be or ask for my phone number to let me know it is done. 10:17 PM Arrived in the parking lot and it wasn't busy since there were a few spots open along the restaurant. Expecting to get the meal within a few minutes. 10:18 Paid for the food at the to-go/cheesecake display area. While waiting we noticed other people were waiting for the cashier to help them out. They must have been at the cashier's for at least 5 minutes without being helped. We also noticed that it wasn't as busy as it normally is since their hallway wait area was not packed and there were empty tables. 10:55 PM Got the TAKE-OUT Cuban sandwich. Way too long of a wait time. 10:56 PM I noticed the fries and sandwich were lukewarm. Didn't even bother to ask for hot food because the wait time was not worth it. 11:10 PM Got home and ate the meal. The sandwich was good because of the great quality meats they had and the fresh bread, but again lukewarm. Not worth the wait. There were about 20 fries in the bag and they were comparable to Burger King's. Not worth the extra dollars for the Cheese Cake Factory name attached. Some of the fries had a frozen fry taste to it as well. I suggest to not get fries or if anything, order them extra crispy to make it palatable. Or maybe even get the side salad instead of fries. In general, I would give them 0 stars and not come back due to the approximate 48 minute wait time for a TAKE OUT order and my meal being under par for having to wait during a time when the restaurant isn't that busy."
Lisa X.,"Sacramento, CA",0,30,,4.0,2/10/2017,"0 STAR FOR THE FOOD! I have ordered their food before and I'm not impressed by it. It's a little too expensive for the bland taste it can be. The bread they serve first while we all wait for our order is so good though! I only take a small bite... Their utensils sometimes have dry foods from before stuck on it and that's quite disgusting to me. Ever since this experience, I've been coming here once every 6 months or once a year, but it's slowly becoming none a year. And I don't order their food anymore. Just the cheesecake cause who doesn't love cheesecake? :) 4 STARS FOR THE CHEESECAKE THOUGH! I rarely come here, but when I do, it's usually with my sisters. I'm mainly here for the variety of cheesecake that they have. It's hard to choose what to eat since they all sound and look delicious. They're really expensive though, so it's a good thing that I rarely come here."
