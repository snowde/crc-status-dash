Nick P.,"Woodland, CA",29,243,5,3.0,3/24/2011,"Really?  Are we, as a society, really at the point where a 2500 calorie lunch seems like a good idea? Don't get me wrong, the food is good, sometimes very good (Factory Burger!), and the cheesecake is ridiculously rich and decadent (chocolate coconut!) but my word, making a habit of this place would be deadly! Space is as nice as the rest of these I've eaten at, with notably high ceilings and a nicely laid out dining area. I suppose if you're blessed with a good metabolism, a strong heart, and a healthy sense of portion control, then go nuts.  If you aren't however (like me), then you might want to think a bit."
Katie G.,"Sacramento, CA",3,23,2,4.0,10/5/2013,"I live right near this Cheesecake Factory, so  I come here relatively often with my boyfriend. Even when it's busy, the two of us don't have problems just walking in and sitting at the bar. I think that one time we gad to wait for a table or seats in the bar area for maybe 10 minutes.  My boyfriend always gets the chicken enchiladas and they are delicious. Not the most authentic enchilada, but still good nonetheless.  I usually try to get two of the small plates so I can have a little variety. I really enjoy all of the flatbreads they have there. I think my favorite is probably the pear and blue cheese one. It is a little sweeter than I would have expected but was still very good.  The ahi tartare is amazing. I was surprised at the quality of the ahi in there because this is a chain restaurant. But it did taste very fresh and the avocado and sauce that come with it are perfect.  I had the endive salad, but it wasn't my favorite. The lettuce has a very string flavor, which I wasn't really prepared for. The dressing was just alright. Nothing special.  The arugula salad was pretty good. I really like that instead of dressing they just put olive oil and lemon on the salad. The last time I ordered this though, there was wayyyy too much lemon juice and it was nearly in edible. I'll likely request for light lemon juice next time to avoid this.  The grilled artichokes are delicious. They come with two dips and one if them is a vinaigrette that is surprisingly well matched with the artichoke. I'm definitely getting this every time I go here now.  The crispy crab bites and the crab cakes are both delicious! They are also very rich and I could only eat one. I would only get these if there were a group of people to eat them.  The Carlton salad is pretty good. I really like salads with dried fruit and candied nuts, but since I had this there I've had a number of better salads like this. I would pass on this in favor of something else.   The lemon raspberry cheesecake is the greatest. It's the only cheesecake I ever get here. Amazing! The service here is always consistent. The servers are very nice and attentive. Sitting at the bar, I've noticed that service is a little slower, but I don't mind it."
Hong T.,"Elk Grove, CA",55,120,171,3.0,3/9/2013,"Headed here to celebrate my moms birthday with my dad and sister. We chose this place because of their large menu which we figured would satisfy everyone. On a friday night there was a 30 minute wait which is very reasonable....we spent those 30 minutes drooling at the cheesecake display. We were greeted fairly quickly when we were seated and our drinks followed shortly. Since we wanted to enjoy the celebration we decided to order the appetizers first, and our main meal after we finished the appetizers. We started off with the calamari and nachos with chicken. The portion sizes here are huge...the calamari was well seasoned and fried, the nachos had large scoops of sour cream, guacomole, salsa, and covered with melted cheese....very good way to start the meal. For dinner, the table ordered the farfalle chicken pasta, grilled rib eye, bbq ranch chicken salad, and the herb crusted salmon....we did it family style so everyone had a little bit of everything. After all of the food we were just too full for cheesecake, but since it was my moms birthday they did sing to her and brought her a very small scoop of ice cream which was very nice."
Lindsey C.,"Sacramento, CA",248,67,6,5.0,8/16/2013,"I refused to eat Cheesecake factory my entire teenage life because I am anti corporate businesses, and I feel that we should give all of our support to family businesses in order to keep control of the jobs, and the money in our country. That being said, my boyfreind begged me to go with him because he loved it and wanted to enjoy it with me so after months of him asking I gave in. Basically, I hate you cheesecake factory! I want to dislike you but I can't! Your service is awesome (despite the one time I had a condescending waiter that was rude to my mother and I wanted to wipe the floor with his face) the food is amazing, the hours of operation are to die for, and the cheesecake is worth the risk of a heart attack! My only complaint (besides the rude waiter and my lack of face wiping) is the music. They can do better than that haha. But everything else is perfect! AVACADO EGGROLLS FTW!"

Kat W.,"Sacramento, CA",14,7,1,5.0,2/26/2014,"The wait for lunch was out the door.  We wanted a table outside so we didn't have to wait more than half an hour to be seated.  We were given our drinks quickly and the food came out within 15 minutes.  Our meals were so good.  Even the vegetable side dishes were cooked to perfection. My husband ordered a dessert of course, a Smore's cheesecake.  I had a couple of bites.  They were amazing but I'm not a cheesecake fan (lactose intolerant) so I didn't have more.  The husband and my son devoured it all.  I hate crowds and deplore waiting in line but the service and food made it all worthwhile.  We will definitely come back!"
Heather M.,"Santa Monica, CA",29,511,6,4.0,9/3/2012,Thumbs up! So many choices so little time. Love their burgers and whatever seasoning they put on them. Love the mashed potatoes! Love the thousand island dressing. Love the free bread. Love the taquitos. Love the chicken enchiladas. There's a lot to love here MINUS the service that I'm 8/10 times not a fan of. So hard to get a refill around this place. Curbside service has always been pretty good. I'm NOT a fan of cheesecake itself so no comment there. I do like the strawberry shortcake though. :) Overall this place is a keeper. Wish they had one in Elk Grove! I know many restaurants in the grove here that I'd like to trade a Cheesecake Factory for!
Julie S.,"Sacramento, CA",155,90,61,4.0,2/28/2013,Cheesecake is awesome! I've tried at least half of them and they never disappoint :) Great place to grab a bits to eat and the staff is pretty friendly.
Rick J.,"West Sacramento, CA",29,45,,5.0,11/10/2013,After contacting The Cheesecake Factory regarding my last visit the general manager contacted me and apologized for my experience.  He also sent me a $10 gift card for a future purchase.  The manager's response was a lot more than I expected from The Cheesecake Factory and I appreciate the time he took to call me and send the gift card.  I will return very soon!
Nick C.,"Galt, CA",20,97,17,5.0,11/7/2010,Awesome! I had the Cajan Chicken and shrimp and it was spicy good  Great service  Sat down and right away had service drinks came right away Dinner came out fast Would recommend to anyone
John S.,"Pleasanton, CA",363,38,,5.0,7/28/2013,"I've never had anything but positive experiences at The Cheesecake Factory. There is a large menu with a very wide selection of food. One of my favorites is the Thai Lettuce Wraps. Servers are consistently excellent. Even though they always are juggling lots of tables because every location stays busy, they are friendly and attentive. Did I mention you have to try a piece of cheesecake?"
Lindsey S.,"Sacramento, CA",0,1,,2.0,2/15/2015,"My girlfriend and I went to cheesecake on Valentine's day, we waited about 2 1/2 hours to be seated. Honestly, I get it because everyone wanted to be seated. They sent us a text saying that our table was ready which was pretty convenient. Our server was awesome but our food was not. When we got our food it was cold on the outside, and warm on the inside which meant really only one thing, it had been sitting out for a while. I didn't really feel like making a huge deal about it but I did tell the waiter it was cold. His only response was that he was sorry. I ate only about a quarter of it because I was starving. My garlic noodles were not garlicky and the side chicken breast I ordered was lacking flavor and juice, it reminded me of beef jerky. My girlfriends plate had shrimp in it and well she ate some of hers too but later got the sweats and threw up. This had been the only thing we are all day so I know this was the cause. My sister then told me she has gotten food poisoning from a salad at cheesecake before so great to know after the fact. I was really disappointed and upset because we paid almost 70$ for a meal that we didn't eat and that was thrown up anyway."
Tyrone V.,"Novato, CA",64,287,9,3.0,11/19/2008,"It's always really cold here (AC wise), which is basically the first thing that stands out to me when I think of The Cheesecake Factory. And even though there's a parking lot, it's still really difficult to find parking , since the restaurant is usually packed. In addition to the temperature, the restaurant is very dimly lit, and very loud, so you really need to speak up when you're having a conversation. Also, some of the tables are really close to each other, almost to the point that you feel like you're eating as a large group, ugh... The one good thing about The Cheesecake Factory is their pastas. I love their marsala and pasta da vinci. I don't stray too far from those two plates, evens though there is definitely a large selection to choose from. Additionally, their service isn't half-bad, if you don't mind them not checking on you very often. They're friendly and will check on you when it's necessary sort-of-thing, especially when the restaurant's crowded. Basically, I'd give the place two stars if it weren't for the fact that their pastas are excellent and their portions are huge. Oh, and I forgot to mention that their cheesecakes aren't very appetizing either, which is really sad since the place is named after the dessert. Don't order any cheesecake with peanut butter in it..."
Betty T.,"Torrance, CA",68,211,75,3.0,5/14/2011,"My boyfriend and I have been to this particular Cheesecake Factory many times. In fact, we actually had one of our first dates here. I remember feeling extremely impressed with the service -- i.e. water was always filled, we were checked up on, etc. However, since that first time, we've been here many, many times -- usually for dinner. Service has been a hit or miss. Sometimes we'll get someone super attentive, and other times, we'll get someone who hurriedly drops off the food and runs away. Last week, we arrived about an hour before closing time and found our server to be...well, not up to par. She rarely checked up on us and just slid things onto the corner of the table and left. I never saw her spend more than 1-2 seconds at our table. She literally just slid things on it and left. The place wasn't even busy!"
Nancy T.,"Sacramento, CA",50,68,39,4.0,8/4/2010,"I went there on a date. My date and I both ordered pastas. She got something with shrimp, and mine was just meat sauce. We both got angel pasta. The pasta was super salty. Now, I thought it was just my sauce, but i told my date and they said that their's was also salty! We figured it must've been the pasta and not the sauce. I told the waiter about it and the guy said they would exchange it right away! He kept apologizing. My date already ate two big prawns (three total) and they replaced all three of them. We both got new plates!  The manager came over to us and apologized to us also. I thought that was very nice of them. We couldn't finish our food, so we got the take out box. We ordered their original cheesecake. It was bombdotcom! I love their cheese cake. The redvelvet cheesecake is also fantastic. But if you are watching your calories, you should not come here.. HAH!"
Kyle T.,"Shingle Springs, CA",67,3,,4.0,2/26/2011,"First off, Cheesecake Factory.. Love it! Great design on the inside. very nice mood lighting. Menu was very creative and detailed. I had the Chicken Marsala with Mushrooms. I would give it a 3 out of 5 Stars on that dish, because it seemed like they tried to drown my chicken in a wine sauce. I would like to taste the chicken not just a sweet wine. However i Selected the Pineapple Upside-down Cheesecake for dessert, and it was to die for! Simply amazing. I would gladly give it a 5 out of 5 for the Cheesecake. I'm a man who loves his cheesecake and I have tasted a many of cheesecake in my time. Also great coffee =)  The service was nice, the waitress brought me my drink in a reasonable amount of time. Didn't like that i asked for a table for two, and they gave me a table for four. hmmmm.. no no in my book :(  Pros: Variety, Peace, Leave happy, Good vibe.  Cons: I felt to close to the table next to me,"
Daniel M.,"Sacramento, CA",22,12,,3.0,3/7/2014,This place is always packed. Expect to wait 20 minutes for a seat. Cheap food that tastes reasonably well. Experience is just ok for me.
Stefanie H.,"Sacramento, CA",111,230,,4.0,9/23/2010,"If you've been to one Cheesecake Factory, you've been to them all.  Sure, you'll end up consuming more calories in one sitting than you should have in an entire week...but at least it's delicious.   If you've never been to a Cheesecake Factory and you don't know what to expect, I'll summarize - above average chain food, delicious cheesecakes, a menu that rivals the great Russian literary masterpieces in length, and an unholy number of calories in most dishes.  If you take the basic sit-down chains like Olive Garden or Red Lobster and then bump up the quality a notch or two, you get The Cheesecake Factory.   My only real complaint is that I wish they had much smaller portions of the cheesecakes, or some kind of sampler tray for 2 or 4 people where you can get a whole bunch of tiny portions of different cheesecakes.  It's SO HARD to pick just one, and it gets really expensive to order more than a few, even if you do take them home and save the leftovers for later."
Juliana L.,"Olivehurst, CA",77,84,82,3.0,4/22/2011,"Ok so the reason why I am giving this place a 3 star review is because of inconsistent service staff. There are days where the waiter/waitress is kind and actually seems happy that you are there & there of course are the exact opposite. And I can't even correlate it to a specific time of day. I recently took my father here for his birthday, I was a little worried because we showed up just before 5pm. It took about 30min for us to get seated, we did have a group of 5, but honestly the place was not packed (yet.)  We ended up being sat at a booth in the bar, which I won't complain because of the $5 happy hour appetizers! I don't remember our waitresses name but she was really nice & patient with us. My father & his significant other had never been to the Cheesecake Factory before and it took them a while to wade through the menu. WTF is up with the menu?! I'm sorry but the menu is monstrously huge! I would say almost inappropriately huge. Oh and what's up with the ads? And if you don't have a nice patient waiter/waitress you won't have a good experience. I choose the fried calamari as an appetizer, let me tell you the garlicy sauce they serve with them is TO DIE FOR!! Portions are huge, so it is worth the $. The CHEESECAKE! Again the menu is quite cumbersome even for the cheesecakes. And I do have a beef with not all the cheesecakes being CHEESECAKE. Some seem to be cake with some kind of cheesecake put in the middle then given the name Cheesecake for the restaurants name sake. I love the original cheesecake. The redvelvet cheesecake is so wonderful, but don't take it home if you don't finish it, it's not good next day. I've also had the Dutch Apple cheesecake which was also surprisingly freaking awesome (I was expecting to like it but it went far beyond my expectations.) Although this is not my favorite restaurant, its flaws are not enough to prevent me from returning."
Rodel R.,"Sacramento, CA",141,359,18,3.0,11/3/2010,"Not bad, that is if you are willing to spend $7 on a slice of cheesecake.  There is also a lot of variety on the menu, but I usually come here for the cheesecake on promotional days ($1.50 slice day, woo!).  Don't get me wrong, the cheesecake is great, but probably just a little too rich, both in sugar and in cost.   LOL @ the fact they put the amount of calories in every slice in the menu... ""978 cal. per slice"" Service is usually friendly, but this place can get pretty busy making the service pretty slow.  My friends that have ordered their food have not been impressed with the taste in general."
Nick P.,"Woodland, United States",29,243,5,3.0,24/3/2011,"Really?  Are we, as a society, really at the point where a 2500 calorie lunch seems like a good idea? Don't get me wrong, the food is good, sometimes very good (Factory Burger!), and the cheesecake is ridiculously rich and decadent (chocolate coconut!) but my word, making a habit of this place would be deadly! Space is as nice as the rest of these I've eaten at, with notably high ceilings and a nicely laid out dining area. I suppose if you're blessed with a good metabolism, a strong heart, and a healthy sense of portion control, then go nuts.  If you aren't however (like me), then you might want to think a bit."

Stefanie H.,"Sacramento, United States",111,230,,4.0,23/9/2010,"If you've been to one Cheesecake Factory, you've been to them all.  Sure, you'll end up consuming more calories in one sitting than you should have in an entire week...but at least it's delicious.   If you've never been to a Cheesecake Factory and you don't know what to expect, I'll summarize - above average chain food, delicious cheesecakes, a menu that rivals the great Russian literary masterpieces in length, and an unholy number of calories in most dishes.  If you take the basic sit-down chains like Olive Garden or Red Lobster and then bump up the quality a notch or two, you get The Cheesecake Factory.   My only real complaint is that I wish they had much smaller portions of the cheesecakes, or some kind of sampler tray for 2 or 4 people where you can get a whole bunch of tiny portions of different cheesecakes.  It's SO HARD to pick just one, and it gets really expensive to order more than a few, even if you do take them home and save the leftovers for later."
Juliana L.,"Olivehurst, United States",77,84,82,3.0,22/4/2011,"Ok so the reason why I am giving this place a 3 star review is because of inconsistent service staff. There are days where the waiter/waitress is kind and actually seems happy that you are there & there of course are the exact opposite. And I can't even correlate it to a specific time of day. I recently took my father here for his birthday, I was a little worried because we showed up just before 5pm. It took about 30min for us to get seated, we did have a group of 5, but honestly the place was not packed (yet.)  We ended up being sat at a booth in the bar, which I won't complain because of the $5 happy hour appetizers! I don't remember our waitresses name but she was really nice & patient with us. My father & his significant other had never been to the Cheesecake Factory before and it took them a while to wade through the menu. WTF is up with the menu?! I'm sorry but the menu is monstrously huge! I would say almost inappropriately huge. Oh and what's up with the ads? And if you don't have a nice patient waiter/waitress you won't have a good experience. I choose the fried calamari as an appetizer, let me tell you the garlicy sauce they serve with them is TO DIE FOR!! Portions are huge, so it is worth the $. The CHEESECAKE! Again the menu is quite cumbersome even for the cheesecakes. And I do have a beef with not all the cheesecakes being CHEESECAKE. Some seem to be cake with some kind of cheesecake put in the middle then given the name Cheesecake for the restaurants name sake. I love the original cheesecake. The redvelvet cheesecake is so wonderful, but don't take it home if you don't finish it, it's not good next day. I've also had the Dutch Apple cheesecake which was also surprisingly freaking awesome (I was expecting to like it but it went far beyond my expectations.) Although this is not my favorite restaurant, its flaws are not enough to prevent me from returning."

""978 cal. per slice"" Service is usually friendly, but this place can get pretty busy making the service pretty slow.  My friends that have ordered their food have not been impressed with the taste in general."
