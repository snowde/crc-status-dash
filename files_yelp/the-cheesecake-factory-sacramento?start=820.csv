Dana J.,"Sacramento, CA",6,57,15,4.0,6/7/2013,"The atmosphere is great! Coming with friends is always great and you have a lot of fun. The food is so-so though. I had the hawaiian pizza and i did not like it very much because it tasted like tap water, dont ask. The pizza was so plain..like one of those you buy in the freezer isle and bake it home, now dont get me wrong those are good but a pizza like that for 13 bucks is not worth it. My friend had a cajun pasta dish and it was tasty but i think i can get better food elsewhere. Just stick to the desserts and you will be pleased!"
jim j.,"Carmichael, CA",0,3,,1.0,7/4/2012,"Are you freaking kidding me..... This is mass produced, frozen, microwaved crap...  I'm always amazed at how little food intelligence Americans have... Hell even their cheesecake is just OK....  How this place stays in business and how people even claim to like this crap is beyond me......"
Tianna W.,"Sacramento, CA",162,211,500,4.0,2/1/2013,"Honestly, even for a chain restaurant, this place is good.  You have to go for Happy Hour-you can get appetizers for $5.  My favorite so far, and I have been able to convince other tables to order are the Buffalo Blast Wings.  I love the complimentary wheat bread and butter! The fried mac n cheese, flautas, taquitos are good.  The southern fried chicken sandwiches needs my secret sauce to make them excellent and special. Oh the cheese cakes.....well, I read the nutritional facts to narrow down to  what to order.  The vanilla bean, is mild with a taste of original cheese cake topped with vanilla bean cheese cake, the lemon one is good (minus the lady fingers), the Dulce de Leche (my mom's favorite) is good, the banana one doesn't have a graham cracker crusted but topped with fresh bananas (it's just okay), the pina colada was tasted cheese cake, and rum cake together was pretty good.  Other cheese cakes looks delicious, but if I eat, I'll never live to write another yelp review.  I would like to try one of their cheese burgers or pastas. The customer service is ALWAYS good, attentive, customer focus, clean restaurant, and keeps me coming back and convincing others to go their to eat!"
Brandy H.,"Carmichael, CA",53,309,34,4.0,4/22/2011,"We came in just to get some cheesecake to take home.  Both women behind the register were very friendly.  We were asked right away if we need assistance.  When I ordered a slice of raspberry chocolate truffle one asked if I had tried the white chocolate and I had, and she told me it was her favorite.   We have eaten here before and the portions are huge, not ideal for people watching what they eat.  Once slice of cheesecake is perfect to share.  We will be back."
Hitesh B.,"Woodland, CA",30,66,,1.0,1/11/2015,"Crazy busy today, so I decided to order curbside e.g. order To Go and Corinne S. was the lady who took my order of nachos, she asks if I want to add chicken, which I explicitly say no, I then order a Tiramisu and Carrot cake so I am spending like $32.  It takes 40 minutes to make the Nachos and when I get home I find out that I was charged for nachos with chicken and have chicken on my nachos.  Being vegetarian this just frustrated me to no end, I drive back to Cheese Cake Factory and it takes 20 minutes to get another nachos and they credit me the difference, but no effort to sincerely apologize for wasting more than an hour of my time and a second trip back to the restaurant.  If you are vegetarian be careful and everyone should check their receipt they like to print out a ridiculous number of receipts, I ended up with 9 receipts and had to sign 3 times, which I think is just a tactic to confuse the hell out of customer into paying more.  Thanks Corinne for making my Sunday not so pleasant.  At the very least management should should have come over to apologize and provide the nachos on the house for badly screwing up an order.  I doubt I will be coming back anytime soon."
Bettina C.,"Sacramento, CA",555,21,6,4.0,10/11/2012,"I have always enjoyed this place from way back in Seattle. The atmosphere is always fun and fast place. Te food is never sent back and the drinks are igh in helpings. The decoration on the walls are enchanting. The interior designs are elegant. I enjoy the Monte Crisco sandwich the most ! Throughout the day it still as fantastic as the morning. When traveling I came to find out that the even had a better happy hour. With $5 drinks and fantastic food, why would you ever want to leave? I have been dinning here for years and never plan to stop. With a small text  book for a menu you are bound to always find something to like."
Nise R.,"Concord, CA",43,77,2,4.0,3/1/2013,"I love this place everywhere I've tried it, from Southern California to here. Love the chicken salad sandwich which my parents got me hooked on because I used to always get appetizers (excellent) for happy hour or the wasabi crusted ahi for an entree. The citrus chicken salad is HUGE even when you want a light lunch! Our waitress this past Monday night was awesome and we didn't have to ask for anything, as she was right there asking if we needed anything a couple times, although not overdoing it. :)"
Brandon W.,"Stockton, CA",238,231,2,3.0,5/2/2010,"Every time I go here, I go expecting a typical American/fusion chain meal, loaded with salt and other crap like Applebee's.  I always end up liking my meal even when I try not to like it.  Even better, considering the kind of restaurant it is and the business it gets, the prices are actually reasonable. This place is pretty busy on weekend nights - expect a wait.  The interior looks clean, but the floor always feels wet to me... it could just be my imagination though.  It's very crowded and walking through the place it felt more like a packed San Francisco joint than a chain restaurant in the valley. I had the spicy chicken sandwich with chipotle sauce.  The sandwich wasn't spicy at all, but the chicken patty they give you was delicious - a very thick cut of white meat that was still juicy and tender.  The bun t was served in was toasted and sweet.  The chipotle sauce was too mild for my taste, but still decent.  My main complaint about the sandwich itself was that they give you shredded iceberg lettuce rather than a more leafy cut.  The fries that came with the meal were cooked perfectly, which a nice crunch but no burnt pieces. Another guest had the pork chop. It comes bone-in, with potatoes and a glaze.  I wasn't a big fan of their glaze, but the pork was cooked perfectly and the potatoes that came with it were delicious. Another guest had the misu salmon, which I did not try but I can say the presentation was interesting - it was served on top of a thick ""disc"" of rice and edamame's surrounding it like a clock. For dessert, we had the dulce de leche cheesecake and the strawberry shortcake.  The cheesecake was very good - creamy from top to bottom with a consistent and potent dulce de leche taste.  The strawberry shortcake was probably the best I've ever had - instead of serving it with a sponge cake, it's served with a sweet biscuit-like bread and with a large amount of ice cream, whipped cream, and strawberries.  Both desserts were excellent and a great way to finish the meal. Prices appear high here, but portions are very large.  I cannot fathom ever finishing a dessert here by myself, so prepare to share."
Karen S.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,219,49,5.0,6/7/2013,I love this location! The wait staff is super nice and attentive. Food is always consistent and as ordered.
Michael M.,"San Francisco, CA",300,229,28,4.0,11/4/2012,"I've eaten here a few times before, and its pretty average. If you look at my review of another Cheesecake factory, I would say the same about this."
Jenny D.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,37,48,5.0,5/25/2013,Went to the Cheesecake Factory for my friends birthday tonight. The food was awesome and the portions are HUGE! The service was great! We had outdoor seating because it was too packed inside. It was cold but the hearters sure kepted  us warm. STEVE was super nice. We had a party of 16+ and all the waiters/waitress were super nice. They never had cake with us when we were cutting the cake! STEVE! You were awesome! Will definitely come back next time!
Tony U.,"Oakland, CA",292,872,598,4.0,12/4/2012,"excellent service, variety of food and a fun, social environment.  love the mac and cheese here and the healthy menu has a lot of goodies."
Annie B.,"Carmichael, CA",93,69,44,2.0,2/25/2011,"Ugh...why do I go here.  The last two times I have gone here, the food has been okay but the service has been average to poor.   I always feel that I am being rushed to eat my food at fast as possible and get out so they can turn my table over to the next customer.  It is as soon as they deliver your entree, you have 10 minutes to eat and if you order dessert that buys you another 10 minutes.  After that your server drops the check off while you're still eating and states sweetly, ""here is your check, no rush.""  I call bullcrap. For example: Once I was here with my accountant for dinner and we had just finished our dinner and were contemplating dessert when I could see the manager eyeing our table.  I guess our table was the holdout because he needed to make a 15 top and couldn't until we left.  It is not like we spent 2 hours there, it was about 45 minutes from sit down to dinner.  I felt that if the manager could vaporize us with his eyes to make us move, we would be vapoooorized to oblivion. I have felt less rushed at an IHOP than Sacramento CF. Food is okay but I am tired of being hustled.  Note:  I have been to other CFs and have not felt rushed.  Maybe corporate has assigned quotas to this one?  Who knows?"
Liz H.,"Vacaville, CA",58,22,2,4.0,10/7/2014,I enjoyed my visits I had here. I came to this location a few times. The staff was always great. I love the soup. I had a issue and the manager was more than helpful with the issue. I will be back soon.
Andy V.,"San Jose, CA",159,150,21,4.0,2/13/2010,"Went here with my gf. the wait wasn't that long 15-20 minutes  I got beer battered fish and chips: Basically 5 pieces of battered salmon, fries and cole saw for 17 bucks? Pretty pricey, very good portions but the tastes wasn't on par.  Green Ice Tea: was pretty refreshing, tasted like spearmint gum actually. Gf got: Famous meatloaf: she said it was good but dry and needed more flavor and calories :)  The black bread they give you for free was good and sweet  Great customer service."
Jenna-Lee M.,"Sacramento, CA",0,2,,2.0,11/17/2013,"So, This was my first time being at this particular location. The service wasn't horrible. The waitress, not quite sure of her name, was nice. However, it took soooo long for our food to come out!! It took so long that we were about to walk out and go down the street to The Olive Garden! I'm not so sure that I'll go back here, but if I do, I'll be sure to have a few hours to spare!"
Ximena C.,"Grandville, MI",25,11,,3.0,4/23/2013,"As always their Cheesecake is delicious. However their vegetarian burger had to have been the worse I've ever had. I've had beet based patties before but this was just horrible!! If you're a vegetarian, might want to skip this."
Miika M.,"San Francisco, CA",2238,1692,2104,3.0,12/7/2006,"I had just started off a relaxing evening when I was rifling through my mail and found a letter from my ex, who said, quote: ""You have set the bar too high for anyone.  Give me a call."" Ya, right, loser.  So, since my evening was already somewhat ruined by being contacted in that way, I agreed to meet up with my good friend Melody, who was in the mood for some cheesecake.  We decided to drive to the Arden Mall to hit the Cheesecake Factory. My first experience at this chain, was actually when it first opened in San Francisco.  I was conducting a shopping tour with a bunch of friends from Japan and since we had just finished a rigorous utilization of credit cards at Macy's, staying in the same building seemed like a great idea.  What I remembered, was the whimsical interior design and the mega large portions of food. So, a quick zip back to now, we walked in around 8:30 and find out it will be about a 15 minute wait.  The lobby was packed with people, mostly young.  I felt a stab of remorse.  What was I doing in here, when I should be at home, getting ready to sleep and rejuvenate myself for work the next day  ;o) We were seated in about the time stated in the alcove to the left of the kitchen.  This gave me a moment to adjust my peripherals and vision to the dim lit setting inside.  Let me put it this way, if you are here on a date, you will look good.  There is no lighting on the tables, so wrinkles and other non-efficiencies will not be on display.  The dimmed lighting even made me feel good, not too fond of my freckles and war scars.  In addition to the lighting, the dark wood tables and booths contrast greatly with the whirled beige/rose walls and up into the mosaic of swirls and plush rounds of art displayed on the ceiling.  It made me feel as if I were sitting in a pseudo touchy feely version of an Americanized Casbah.   Our server was Donald (who was all smiles and cute with his successful communicative abilities) and after a quick perusal of the menu, decided that my large butt did not deserve anything other than the large Market Salad, conglomeration of mixed greens, radicchio, endive, fresh sweet beets, pieces of avocado and Kalamata olives tossed in their house vinaigrette ($8.95) and a signature pizza, the Pesto Chicken with a dash of fresh garlic ordered as an extra topping (I think it was around $10).  They have a large menu here, so be prepared to take your time, or at least have an inkling of what you and your stomach are predisposed to.  In addition to standard American fare {Meatloaf entree, hamburgers, sandwiches, and pastas, are their takes/attempts at Asian fusion choices, which are evident in their appetizers (Vietnamese Shrimp Summer Rolls, Thai Lettuce Wraps) and more.  They even make omelets, for gawd's sake}  Add in another two pages stock filled with every sort of cheesecake imaginable, and your evening is set. I was impressed with my salad.  Huge.  Large.  And the beets were dumped like bombs, red ones, staring at me with an ominous presence.  Everything was fresh, crunchy, and the right texture.  Our pizza was pretty good.  In fact, better than California Pizza Kitchen.  Lots of creamy cheese that strung off my slice as it traveled the perilous journey from the serving plate to my dinner plate.  Pieces of tender marinated chicken, red roasted peppers, and the pesto base was exquisite.  I can't believe I'm saying this about their pizza, it was not expected.  The crust was thin, but not too thin, as the edge had bubbled up perfectly to ensconce the thick topping and slightly sweet.   All the while, Donald was quite attentive, stopping by several times to make sure everything was satisfactory.  At one point, since I was busy pulling the stereotypical Japanese move and fiddling with my new Sureshot camera, we spent several moments talking about picture depth and macro mode.   After we finished, we had only consumed two slices of pizza from a round of 6, which Melody took home.  Our bill, with the two Market Salads, the pizza, two ice teas and her cheesecake, came out to around $43.  Not too bad, considering she used a gift certificate, which brought our total down to $12-15 each. Good reception, good service, and good food.  After rethinking my cruel and unforgiving opinion of chains, I would come back here again."
John F.,"Oakland, CA",14,218,115,3.0,12/10/2010,"I forgot how huge the menu is!!! Either way, our waitress was totally okay and patient with us. Not one hint of attitude. I ordered the salmon with mash, asparagus with a lemon sauce. When the plate came, I was pleased to see a large portion of salmon cooked really well with a huge heap of mashed potatoes. I only got five thin pieces of asparagus - I was a little peeved about that, but at least it was cooked well. Oh and the lord forsaken lemon sauce, I could of done without that. There was a huge pool of it on the plate. ""I don't remember asking for extra sauce."" I said when I seen the plate.  Nonetheless, the food was good. I was full, I couldn't even finish the plate. The water and drink glass never fell short. Good job. Oh yea, even though it was really busy, we didn't wait longer than 10 minutes. Always a plus! 3.5 really."
Misty M.,"Elk Grove, CA",244,116,39,2.0,12/28/2010,"We went here for a friend's birthday as a surprise. Which is kind of hard because they don't do reservations.  Anyway what set me off from this place was the wait time. I really don't care about waiting but please tell me an accurate time! I asked for a table for 13 people and they said 1 hour wait....an hour passes by ... ""Hi Is our table ready yet?"" The guy ""Oh No, it will be an hour...It's only been 15 minutes..."" OK?! WTH? Can I not tell time or something? Because I had 3 other people agree that we waited quite awhile to get seated. Ugh seriously I don't care just stop BSing people, and I really don't give a rat's ass if your busy! The host had to call over that guy because apparently he had all the power for seating blah blah!  Anyways the food was OKAY. Could have been better. I did like that the server acknowledged there was a birthday recipient at the table and brought over a dessert and some singing companions ... but that was half -assed which was obvious because i couldn't hear them when they were right in front of me and they didn't look like they even wanted to do. Separate the business from the personal people, thats part of the job description!  I'm not there to humiliate them and I don't care if you did a billion happy birthdays during the shift but if you want to execute excellent customer service you should be above being a half-ass and get it right. My friend is a waitress for a diner and she wanted to give them a pity-tip because she felt bad. HELL NO. we gave what was the minimum acceptable gratuity in relation to service."

So, a quick zip back to now, we walked in around 8:30 and find out it will be about a 15 minute wait.  The lobby was packed with people, mostly young.  I felt a stab of remorse.  What was I doing in here, when I should be at home, getting ready to sleep and rejuvenate myself for work the next day  ;o) We were seated in about the time stated in the alcove to the left of the kitchen.  This gave me a moment to adjust my peripherals and vision to the dim lit setting inside.  Let me put it this way, if you are here on a date, you will look good.  There is no lighting on the tables, so wrinkles and other non-efficiencies will not be on display.  The dimmed lighting even made me feel good, not too fond of my freckles and war scars.  In addition to the lighting, the dark wood tables and booths contrast greatly with the whirled beige/rose walls and up into the mosaic of swirls and plush rounds of art displayed on the ceiling.  It made me feel as if I were sitting in a pseudo touchy feely version of an Americanized Casbah.   Our server was Donald (who was all smiles and cute with his successful communicative abilities) and after a quick perusal of the menu, decided that my large butt did not deserve anything other than the large Market Salad, conglomeration of mixed greens, radicchio, endive, fresh sweet beets, pieces of avocado and Kalamata olives tossed in their house vinaigrette ($8.95) and a signature pizza, the Pesto Chicken with a dash of fresh garlic ordered as an extra topping (I think it was around $10).  They have a large menu here, so be prepared to take your time, or at least have an inkling of what you and your stomach are predisposed to.  In addition to standard American fare {Meatloaf entree, hamburgers, sandwiches, and pastas, are their takes/attempts at Asian fusion choices, which are evident in their appetizers (Vietnamese Shrimp Summer Rolls, Thai Lettuce Wraps) and more.  They even make omelets, for gawd's sake}  Add in another two pages stock filled with every sort of cheesecake imaginable, and your evening is set. I was impressed with my salad.  Huge.  Large.  And the beets were dumped like bombs, red ones, staring at me with an ominous presence.  Everything was fresh, crunchy, and the right texture.  Our pizza was pretty good.  In fact, better than California Pizza Kitchen.  Lots of creamy cheese that strung off my slice as it traveled the perilous journey from the serving plate to my dinner plate.  Pieces of tender marinated chicken, red roasted peppers, and the pesto base was exquisite.  I can't believe I'm saying this about their pizza, it was not expected.  The crust was thin, but not too thin, as the edge had bubbled up perfectly to ensconce the thick topping and slightly sweet.   All the while, Donald was quite attentive, stopping by several times to make sure everything was satisfactory.  At one point, since I was busy pulling the stereotypical Japanese move and fiddling with my new Sureshot camera, we spent several moments talking about picture depth and macro mode.   After we finished, we had only consumed two slices of pizza from a round of 6, which Melody took home.  Our bill, with the two Market Salads, the pizza, two ice teas and her cheesecake, came out to around $43.  Not too bad, considering she used a gift certificate, which brought our total down to $12-15 each. Good reception, good service, and good food.  After rethinking my cruel and unforgiving opinion of chains, I would come back here again."

I ordered the salmon with mash, asparagus with a lemon sauce. When the plate came, I was pleased to see a large portion of salmon cooked really well with a huge heap of mashed potatoes. I only got five thin pieces of asparagus - I was a little peeved about that, but at least it was cooked well. Oh and the lord forsaken lemon sauce, I could of done without that. There was a huge pool of it on the plate. ""I don't remember asking for extra sauce."" I said when I seen the plate.  Nonetheless, the food was good. I was full, I couldn't even finish the plate. The water and drink glass never fell short. Good job. Oh yea, even though it was really busy, we didn't wait longer than 10 minutes. Always a plus! 3.5 really."
Misty M.,"Elk Grove, United States",244,116,39,2.0,28/12/2010,"We went here for a friend's birthday as a surprise. Which is kind of hard because they don't do reservations.  Anyway what set me off from this place was the wait time. I really don't care about waiting but please tell me an accurate time! I asked for a table for 13 people and they said 1 hour wait....an hour passes by ... ""Hi Is our table ready yet?"" The guy ""Oh No, it will be an hour...It's only been 15 minutes..."" OK?! WTH? Can I not tell time or something? Because I had 3 other people agree that we waited quite awhile to get seated. Ugh seriously I don't care just stop BSing people, and I really don't give a rat's ass if your busy! The host had to call over that guy because apparently he had all the power for seating blah blah!  Anyways the food was OKAY. Could have been better. I did like that the server acknowledged there was a birthday recipient at the table and brought over a dessert and some singing companions ... but that was half -assed which was obvious because i couldn't hear them when they were right in front of me and they didn't look like they even wanted to do. Separate the business from the personal people, thats part of the job description!  I'm not there to humiliate them and I don't care if you did a billion happy birthdays during the shift but if you want to execute excellent customer service you should be above being a half-ass and get it right. My friend is a waitress for a diner and she wanted to give them a pity-tip because she felt bad. HELL NO. we gave what was the minimum acceptable gratuity in relation to service."
