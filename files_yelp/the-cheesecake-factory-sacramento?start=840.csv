Anthony I.,"Sacramento, CA",13,8,6,2.0,8/20/2012,"I visited this restaurant on April 30, 2012. This was a Monday. I had called two days prior and asked the receptionist what their slowest day of the week was, so as to avoid the endless stream of Cheesecake Factory patrons. Monday was their slowest day of the week according to the woman on the phone. Monday was my birthday so this worked out perfectly. I show up with a party of four (me included) Monday around 5 pm. I mentioned to the hostess that we would be having four additional guests showing up for dessert only. She was kind enough to give me several seating options. I chose to sit at the tables closest to the bar. Our waitress was decent. She got us started off with the drinks. I ordered the caramel pretzel vodka milkshake. (Had I known that one drink was $10 I would have never ordered it. ALL prices should be listed on Cheesecake Factory's menu, not just some of them!) Sadly the drink was not up to par with its premium pricing. There was more than a pregnant pause between ordering our drinks and ordering our food. I was a little annoyed that ordering took so long, especially because the restaurant seemed very empty. Our orders were placed. Again I felt there was an extraordinarily long wait for our food. We were a party of four, and the restaurant was uncharacteristic of the seemingly always busy Cheesecake Factory I have seen in the past. I do not remember the exact placement of events, but somewhere between ordering our food and getting our food, our initial waitress had left for a lunch break. This is where I felt my visit went downhill. I do not recall the fill-in waitress ever checking on us, nor being present when our food arrived. The food itself was good. Always is. Again I do not remember the exact order of events that took place, but the additional four guests arrived and our original waitress returned from her lunch break. Desert was ordered. Desert was probably the most time consuming part of our visit. It took FOREVER to receive our damn cheesecake! Ironically our waitress seemed annoyed with us, like we had done something wrong! Nothing verbal, just silent body language cues. Desert is finished, and the late four arrivals of our party leave. It is now 8 pm, and I swear 2 of the 3 hours we spent in the factory were dedicated to waiting. We received the check... The waitress charged us an automatic gratuity of 18% for our ""large party."" This angered me beyond belief. Our total bill was about $170. That means about $30 was dedicated to her tip alone. I felt this mandatory tip was well in excess of the service rendered. Aside from a lacking in service I didn't feel that I needed to pay more for four people who only received dessert. When questioned about this mandatory tip, our server gave us a very obvious attitude, and told us it was ""Factory Policy."" I work in retail customer service and I know good service when I see it. This was not good service."
Carrie G.,"Los Angeles, CA",210,302,27,4.0,2/18/2011,"Went to CKF for V-Day around 3:30 pm with a date that wanted to go here... Pros: Great cheesecake, steak and service. Cons: Did not give CKF 5 stars because the menu is overwhelming; It's like a T.V. Guide of food which is always a turn off for me. I will go back for cheesecake!!!"
Tiffanie E.,"Elk Grove, CA",66,42,,3.0,7/17/2012,"I think this place is overrated. I don't really care for cheesecakes and the food here but I do really like their balsamic vinaigrette dressing for their salads! I came here today for my coworkers' bday luncheon and I got the Rene's lunch special which consist of a chicken salad (which I had)  or turkey sandwich, a bowl of soup and a small salad. It was OK. I like how they toasted their bread for the sandwich but it was a bit too buttery for me. Overall, it was OK."
Jonathan D.,"Rocklin, CA",4,23,11,4.0,4/23/2010,"Came in on a wednesday for lunch and the place was absolutely packed! i was very surprised when they told us it may be a 25 minute wait, and it only turned out to be about 10 minutes. i was definitely iffy about cheesecake factory because of the fact that they serve all different kinds of cuisine. They have italian, chinese, mexican, american, and maybe others too. i often find that at these restaurants the food tends to be mediocre at best. I ordered the fish tacos, with mahi mahi, and my lady ordered the tostada chicken salad. I was absolutely blown away by their fish tacos. The fish was perfectly cooked, and the combination of the cabbage and sauce and lime juice made them melt in your mouth. My lady's salad was a bit overdressed, but at the same time it was well put together, the chicken was marinaded or rubbed with some kind of spices and was absolutely delicious.' The ONLY reason i am giving this restaurant 4 stars instead of 5 was because of our waiter. I'm not sure if it was because he was busy, or what, but he was quite asshole-ish and came off very condscending. we were turned off by his bad attitude, and it kinda ruined the ambience of the meal."
Joel R.,"Carmichael, CA",0,15,,2.0,7/17/2013,"My wife, son, and I went there for lunch for my wife's birthday. Since the restaurant was not crowded, we only waited for a couple of minutes before they sat us. However, we waited for a good five minutes before a waiter came to us to tell us about their special. He told us that he's going to give us a couple of minutes to look through the menu. However, we waited a good 10 minutes for the waiter to take our order.  We did not get our food until about 15 minutes later.   Since it's my wife's birthday, I asked the waiter if they have anything free as a birthday gift.  However, there is no such thing at the Cheesecake Factory. This, I don't understand.  All other restaurants I visited offers a small cake for birthday occasions.   The food is okay, but nothing special. The food is on the expensive side, especially for lunch. I prefer Elephant Bar, where the wait time is much, much shorter.  Also, unlike the Cheesecake Factory, where the service seems superficial, the service at Elephant Bar is more authentic. I don't think I will be visiting the Cheesecake Factory again anytime soon."
Barbara G.,"Lodi, CA",259,310,22,4.0,1/28/2013,"What can I say, ""It's Cheescake"" and it is delicious every time I come."
Shannon S.,"Sacramento, CA",0,6,,4.0,7/26/2012,"They have an appetizer called Buffalo Blasts and they are amazing!!!!!!! However they don't take reservations and the food is good so be prepared to wait. I know this so I am okay with it and the food is worth it, but if you want to go there prime time and be seated right away the odds are not in your favor."
Ashleigh A.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",177,21,2,5.0,7/26/2010,"I've been to a few different CFs and have always been impressed. However, this latest experience for my boyfriend's birthday at the Arden CF really takes the (cheese)cake. The menu is overwhelming large, but ridiculously tasty. And the fact that their staple item is about a million flavors of cheesecake? I think I may have died and gone to dessert heaven. For my entree I had Evelyn's famous pasta and added chicken. Bomb. Our server (I forget her name) was EXCELLENT. I used to serve in college, so I'm very critical, and she did an excellent job.  I don't like to give 5 stars to chain restaurants (especially ones right outside a mall too), but this experience was really exceptional. Even with all of that being said, I was prepared to dish out a 4 star rating until the dessert came. Not only was the Oreo Cheesecake to die for, the pantry wrote in chocolate sauce ""Happy Birthday Noah"" and had colorful sprinkels adorning the sauce. Delicious, colorful, and artistic....I'm sold!!!"
Holly M.,"Sacramento, CA",181,44,35,3.0,10/8/2012,Menu is a tad bit overwhelming but they have a good salad selection. Their Chinese Chicken Salad is my favorite!
Yves J S.,"Sacramento, CA",96,280,42,4.0,1/8/2010,"When someone thinks of sampler, one usually imagines wings, mozzarella sticks, and onion rings ...or perhaps eggs, bacon, and sausage for breakfast. ...some kind of lame concoction designed to cater to the indecisive or the modest. Cheesecake Factory redefines the word! Sampler to them is ""We will make you regret ordering this on your own you poor poor man!"" Wait, did I just call myself indecisive or modest? ..sorta but not really. I'm not modest, but I did order a Sampler... but I decided to order it so I can't be indecisive... or perhaps my indecisiveness is what lead me to order it... GAH! Either way it was delicious! You get 4 plates of soo much goodness you can do nothing but om nom nom nom....     I love the consistency of this place. You always get large portions, clean and welcoming restaurant, attentive help, and over all a pretty good dining experience. It's also nice to know that you can go to a place for food, and still get a half decent desert if you have room."
liz s.,"Sunnyvale, CA",7,263,4,4.0,4/18/2010,"I love Cheesecake Factory. There's something for even the pickiest of eaters - pizza, pasta, salads, burgers, chicken, seafood you name it. The prices are a bit expensive, but the portions are huge. If you don't want too much, you can order a lunch portion which is still really big. Their cheesecake is to die for. There are so many selections but my favorites are kahlua, banana and pistachio. It's about $7 a slice but oh so yummy. Don't expect to be health conscience with the desserts. Most cheesecake slices average 1000 calories."
MISTY D.,"Sacramento, CA",0,24,,2.0,11/5/2014,"I went out to lunch they have this menu that is like a book, it's a big menu. I ordered the Clam chowder which had no taste and was watery.I had Chicken Marsella it's Chicken on Bow Ties just covered in a brown sauce no taste they shouldn't call it Chicken Marsella. Then the only reason I gave two stars is the Dessert it was the only thing that was really good I had the Adam's Cheesecake.They should stick to Desserts and stay away from the rest of the Food on the Menu the food was mediocre which is not vey good."
Cathy P.,"Portland, OR",464,382,5,2.0,4/21/2008,"My first time ever at a Cheesecake Factory, picked out by my brother-in-law and his kids. Pretty much a big yawn - but you couldn't sleep here because it's SO DARN NOISY!!!! Can someone tell me what an Egyptian temple motive and cheesecake have in common? The inside was Ala Las Vegas: dark and glitzy but our waitress was wonderful. There's no child's menu (which makes up about 60% of the people there) so you order for your kids off the appetizer menu. I don't get that one, neither did my sister-in-law. The menu is enormous and a little intimidating; portions are HUGE and kinda pricey. I had a small fillet of salmon with about 3 POUNDS of plain ol steamed rice that cost me $20, definitely not a very good value but the wine list is decent. Don't think I'd go out of my way to go back to any other Cheesecake Factory in the future. Just so-so food and too noisy. Guess my age must be showing...."
Rosanna C.,"West Sacramento, CA",10,48,29,4.0,5/11/2010,"We went there friday to celebrate my birthday. We had a nice size group and had about an hour wait. Someone got there early and signed us in, so when I walked in we got seated shortly after. (nice, thanks Brian)  I had the louisanna chicken pasta. (omg, I love it) Portions are huge. I should have shared with someone. I love their bread and you can get free bread refills so that is simply WONDERFUl! (yes, I am a carb addict, no atkins didn't work for me, neither did southbeach, ww, or any other ""you have to watch your bread intake"" diet.) I love their Strawberry Lemonade it is $4.95, but the cups are huge and it is so heavenly good! Service was great! Our two servers were constantly checking on us, refilling drinks, bread etc. We sat on the patio facing the street it was very nice, quiet, and just what the birthday girl wanted.  Desert....none! We were all too full. I know..crazy we should have made room or all split one or something."
Matt B.,"Sacramento, CA",2,10,,4.0,3/23/2013,Consistently good. I've never had a bad meal here. They're usually so busy that wait times and service tend to suffer a bit. But overall love the place.
Kate F.,"Downtown, Sacramento, CA",1,5,,1.0,1/12/2014,"I had the worst service I have ever received in my life here last night. I called to set up a reservation for 12 people and was told to come in 15 minutes before the time we wanted to eat (which was 6) to put our name in. I thought only 15 minutes was a stretch for 12 people so I went in a full hour early. When I went in at 5, they then told me it would be two hours before we could be seated. I called everyone else in my party and told them to come at 630. By 6 I went to check on our progress and was told we would be seated by 615, a time when none of our party would be there. I called everyone again and told them to hurry. We didn't get seated until 8 o'clock!!!!!! I was there for three hours, they changed their story multiple times, our party ended up being split into 3 groups so we could eat. It was also a group of mainly elderly relatives that all wanted to go out and have dinner together because we had been to my grandpas funeral earlier that day. Two were in wheel chairs which was my reason for getting there early to make sure they didn't have to sit around and exhaust themselves waiting. I am so disappointed and disgusting with this restaurant. I will never eat here again. They have us a free appetizer which was ridiculous compared to the BS we had to deal with. Plus they messed up our food orders. It would have been nice if they were honest with me in the first place when I called and told me this would be difficult for them to accommodate and not until much later in the evening at that. This place is off my list! I'm pissed and will not give them another dime of my money. Horrible management staff that lied for hours."
Jess G.,"San Jose, CA",42,178,16,4.0,9/23/2010,OMG... so orgasmic that I might just pass out. The cheesecakes are so delicious I don't know how anyone can hate them. This place is also very pretty as is all the Cheesecake Factory restaurants. I think they dimly lit the place not to create a romantic or nice ambiance but to hide how expensive their items are. But it's still so good!!!!!!!! I love their cakes I wish I had the money to try them all!!!!
Ida D.,"Carmichael, CA",0,29,1,5.0,8/3/2014,"Sunday brunch: the Monte Cristo is delicious....very rich, almost custardy and  even has a little crunch!"
Charles L.,"Citrus Heights, CA",48,102,,2.0,3/2/2014,"We went there the other day with very mixed reviews.  The food itself was not very good.  Someone at out table ordered the Buffalo Blasts (I think that's what they were called); they are basically Buffalo-style chicken in a fried wonton.  They were really bland and just seemed to disintegrate when you bit into them or ripped a piece off.  I ordered the lunch pizza and salad: the salad was Actually pretty good and well dressed but the pizza marguerite was really bad.  The only cheese that is supposed to be on that pizza was fresh mozzarella but there was some weird mix on there that gave it a very bitter and almost sour taste, while still managing to be dry.  The good part of our experience were the staff who were all very pleasant and helpful.  I will possibly be back, with a menu that rivals War and Peace there has to be a few good items!"
Marissa T.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,13,1,5.0,2/16/2013,"This place is amazing, a gift from God. The avocado eggrolls are so delicious! The service is always a little wait but thats okay. Everyones is generally nice there, I did once have a meal mix up but they fixed it right away. I always tend to splurge when I eat here"

Charles L.,"Citrus Heights, United States",48,102,,2.0,2/3/2014,"We went there the other day with very mixed reviews.  The food itself was not very good.  Someone at out table ordered the Buffalo Blasts (I think that's what they were called); they are basically Buffalo-style chicken in a fried wonton.  They were really bland and just seemed to disintegrate when you bit into them or ripped a piece off.  I ordered the lunch pizza and salad: the salad was Actually pretty good and well dressed but the pizza marguerite was really bad.  The only cheese that is supposed to be on that pizza was fresh mozzarella but there was some weird mix on there that gave it a very bitter and almost sour taste, while still managing to be dry.  The good part of our experience were the staff who were all very pleasant and helpful.  I will possibly be back, with a menu that rivals War and Peace there has to be a few good items!"

Everyones is generally nice there, I did once have a meal mix up but they fixed it right away. I always tend to splurge when I eat here"
