Allison B.,"Chico, CA",57,108,21,2.0,3/26/2010,"The food here is okay, but nothing amazing. A bit overpriced, IMO. Outside of the cheesecake(red velvet FTW), I haven't had anything great from here.  Wait, no, I take it back. The fried macaroni balls are pretty tasty. OTHERWISE... no thanks."
Vicki U.,"Sacramento, CA",57,91,289,4.0,7/29/2012,"Decent happy hour, some choice drinks and apps for $5, better deal than I had expected.  Excellent server Friday night in the bar area- Christophe, one of the best servers we've had in a long time - friendly, prompt, attentive, great job.  Food's good, what you'd expect  at this kind of place.  I was craving chocolate and the chocolate cake did it!  Rich, dark chocolate, chocolate ganache or mouse filling, chocolate chips.  Wish they allowed dogs on the patio, we would be there more often."
H D.,"Sacramento, CA",27,463,84,4.0,7/21/2012,"Very nice. Visited in June. Christopher was a terrific server. I can see why he has employee of the month and trainer pins. He was on top of drinks, food and boxing up. He helped us choose between two dishes and we were happy with his choice. As usual we didn't  have room for dessert.  Prices are Cheesecake usual."
Jackie S.,"Milpitas, CA",416,1463,2091,4.0,9/24/2007,"I love love love Cheesecake Factory. The lunch and dinner lines are horrendous, but the food is delicious for a chain restaurant. Rye bread is A+. Salads are awesome. Cheesecakes are so rich and artery clogging, but so good. I'd make the 30 minute trek to Cheesecake Factory from Davis."
Karen M.,"Sacramento, CA",7,10,,2.0,1/23/2011,"We usually like Cheesecake Factory for its variety, lemonade and proximity to Arden Fair, but this latest time...we may not return.  Holiday shopping and on a schedule but decided we could splurge for a sit-down lunch during our marathon mall trip.  We ordered and then waited.  And waited.  And waited.  Our server even stopped by once to tell us we were next.  We waited again and when we finally asked a different server, we were told our order hadn't been put in. Our server returned to our table and apologized profusely but didn't offer us anything  for the inconvenience.  We got our food which was only mediocre, perhaps due to the ""rush"" job to get our food out quickly, and when we received our bill, there was no discount, no offer of a free piece of cheesecake...nothing.  At the very least, it would have been nice for the manager to drop by our table and apologize, but it was as if it didn't matter.  Very poor customer service. I still have to give it 2 starts because the key lime cheesecake is to die for and I really like the brown bread that they serve before your meal.  I'll probably be back..."
Gary B.,"Galt, CA",18,28,1,4.0,1/13/2011,"I'll start off by saying that you're wasting a trip if you don't get the blueberry and white chocolate cheesecake :) Some of the best dessert I've had. Overall, it was quite nice. The lighting was dim and the ambient noise was peaceful. I went with the petite fillet mignon which was about 8oz, yet I was still wanting more when I was done. I found it odd that most of the steaks came with french fries so I substituted mashed potatoes. They gave me a mountain of potatoes, which tasted pretty good, but I would have liked a 3rd course such as a vegetable without having to pay an extra $4 for a plate of broccoli (thus the 4 stars instead of 5). The steak was cooked perfectly, and extremely tender. The flavor wasn't all there though. I found myself dipping the meat in my girlfriend's Hibachi steak sauce to liven it up a bit. So if you're wanting steak, I'd probably recommend the Hibachi over the Fillet.  We also had the avacado egg rolls which were absolutely delicious. Someone wanted guacamole also, and that was pretty good too. We rounded it off with a nice bottle of white wine for an overall pleasant meal.  So if you're wanting an amazing dessert and an above average dinner, this is the place to go."
Hien L.,"Sacramento, CA",0,7,26,5.0,7/10/2014,"I absolutely love this place! The service is amazing everyone is really nice and checks up on you constantly ! They are never slow on my refills and I love that! The food is delicious I love the chicken Alfredo and steak. Their cheesecake is very delicious as well. Overall a great place to dine, super fancy and elegant."
MaeIreneGrace W.,"Stockton, CA",18,15,1,5.0,1/7/2012,Love this place! Try the buffalo blast and the fried macaroni. Oh so good!
Heather T.,"Sacramento, CA",78,156,26,4.0,1/29/2010,"I'm not usually a fan of chain restaurants but the Cheesecake Factory has pretty good choices in the extensive menu. I can take or leave the cheesecakes (I'm not big on desserts) but there are several items in the menu that are consistently good throughout different branches in different cities.  When it comes to chain restaurants, even the good ones, I tend to stick with a couple of favorite dishes because I know I will enjoy them. The luau salad is a delicious salad layered with crispy tortilla-like crackers. It's really refreshing and filling (it has chicken, mandarin orange slices, and I can't really remember what else). I also really love the classic burger. The first time I had it, it was cooked SO perfectly -- medium well and juicy! It was a long wait for the burger but well worth the wait!  Another dish that's really good is a pasta dish with penne, eggplant, sundried tomatoes, pine nuts, and tossed in olive oil (I can't really remember the name but I think ""Denise"" is in it).  Service is always really good there too, so that's always a plus. There's ALWAYS a wait though, that's probably the only annoying thing about it. But I guess it's a good sign for the economy!"
Greg G.,"Vancouver, WA",115,235,65,4.0,8/11/2012,"Review date 7-9  Sat at the bar, had Hibachi steak and it was excellent and included a nice range of sides.  Everything was cooked nicely and served pretty fast.  I have not had a bad meal at any of these places.  The worst thing is trying to decide or waiting for a table when you have too many guests to grab a spot at the bar."
lanihuli w.,"Sacramento, CA",1,5,1,4.0,5/5/2011,"Calling all those starving students out here - great happy hour's happening @ this place.  4-6 pm. there's a 5 buck menu, and it's got lots on it, sliders (chicken and beef) GIANT nachos, taquitos, fresh guac and chips, many more choices - oh, and even drink specials. what I do is, forget the soda - drink water!  it's better for you, and the $ you save (if there's at least 2 of you) will almost cover a nice piece of cheese cake. I agree w/the other folks, as I've been to different locations around CA and the service varies. sometimes, it's aweesoome, other times, they give your food away to another table.. but, they always compensate w/very apologetic managers who let you know they're really sorry, offer you free food, and your choice of cheese cake. the portions are HUGE, (I loooove the chicken costaletta) and you always go home w/leftovers - and, they are great for lunch the next day.  for you tiny eaters, maybe dinner the next day too. the decor's nice, but sometimes the floors are craazy slippery w/grease or something.  now this is a hazzard, but I haven't noticed it as much the last couple of visits. otherwise, delish!  many different dishes to choose from, and I've always been happy w/what I've received - the place isn't perfect, but I can appreciate that they're working on it, and continue to update and add new dishes. who doesn't love that? oh yes, and on the group outtings type of note, the last time I was there, they wouldn't let you make reservations for your group (even though ours had more than 15) - which I think is ridiculous.  you can't expect folks to go in there hours before, and wait for them to try to get the tables together - are you kidding?"
Laura W.,"Sacramento, CA",48,158,8,2.0,8/14/2009,"The only reason I even give two stars is because I'm in love with the Factory Burrito and Vanilla Cheesecake. But I'll drive out to Roseville where the service is (sometimes) better if my cravings ever get to me again. I went here when it first opened in Sacramento, and it was terrible. Food, service, wait time, noise, etc. Had the plain cheesecake and it was the worst cheesecake I ever had. My husband concurred. Worst, ever. And we LOVE cheesecake.  Second time we were seated on the patio and the wait staff pretty much forgot about us. My husband knew he had to be to bed early that night, but considering we got there for a normal dinner time, we thought he'd have plenty of time for dinner. He had to leave before the food even arrived. We were there for so many hours waiting, I lost track. After that, I swore the place off. But then I was treated to the Roseville location and had the best experience ever. So husband and I decided to splurge on a nice dinner for our 6 month wedding anniversary at the Arden location thinking maybe since it wasn't so new, they had worked out the kinks. We were being too optimistic.  Waited forever. Were seated at the smallest table, just inches from the people next to us, on either side. Heard every word of their conversation, but could barely hear each other to carry on a conversation of our own. Our table was behind the bar where they had TVs playing sports games with the volume ON. It was astonishingly loud in the place. Service was horrible. I ordered the same burrito I loved at the Roseville location, but it wasn't as packed with all the delicious stuff this time. Still good, but they skimped on the ingredients. Our two dishes barely fit on our tiny table. Waiter rarely checked on us and had a cold demeanor.  But what took the cake was my husband's ""rack"" of ribs, which didn't come as a rack. They were individual ribs (who does that??) and had virtually no meat on them. What was there was fat. But they were so bare to the bone they almost looked as if someone had already eaten them.  Just say no the Arden Cheesecake Factory."
Lydia K.,"Rocklin, CA",441,416,164,4.0,12/23/2009,"Not really a chain food eater here, but have eaten at this and Roseville stores recently (and in Boston)... consistently good food... try the lettuce wraps on the appetizer menu... KILLER!  The service has always been good too.  The prices are a bit higher than I'd like but it is an impressive place and good for special occasions... my kids love it too!"
Kelsey J.,"Sacramento, CA",33,11,,2.0,1/27/2015,"I love the Cheesecake Factory. I go to the Roseville location often and have never had a problem. My boyfriend and I stopped at this location after running errands one day and had the WORST experience ever! We were seated quickly but it took the waitress almost 10 minutes to come say hi I'll get you some water then walk away before we could order any other drinks or even our food since we were ready to order. When she came back she said she could take our order. I ordered a salad and my boyfriend ordered an old fashioned burger. When our food finally came, she brought my boyfriend what looked like some type of sandwich on sourdough bread, and brought me an extremely small appetizer size salad (I actually think it was from their small plates menu which is even smaller than an appetizer) and then promptly ran off before I could spit the words from my mouth that the order was wrong. When she came back 5 minutes later we pointed out that my boyfriend had gotten the wrong burger and I had gotten the wrong size salad. She mumbled something about the burger saying that's what he ordered and then took my salad away. He decided to just eat what he was given and they brought my salad back another 10 minutes later. My lettuce was still frozen! Maybe it was just in the back of the crisper but I always order salads at Cheesecake Factory and have never had this problem. We tried to finish up and get the waitress' attention but it seemed like she was fed up with us already for some reason. The manager finally came by and asked if our issues were resolved and we explained that she never bothered to get my boyfriend the correct order. He said she indeed brought him the factory burger instead of the old fashioned burger. He offered us a free piece of cheesecake and we accepted. We saw the manager talk to the waitress, and the waitress came after the manager left and dropped off the check without saying a word or apologizing to us. Even though the manager tried to salvage the experience for us, I'm not sure we will be back after that mess."

squishy b.,"San Ramon, CA",61,154,62,3.0,3/9/2010,"Is it me or is this place really, really, really dark? Either they're trying to save money on electricity or they don't want you to see what their food looks like, either way it was a bit annoying. Not only could I not see the menu I was looking at, I found myself getting lost trying to navigate through the tables to find my own table again. I might have to invest in a head light if I come here again. Other than the very dim ambiance of the restaurant, the food was pretty good. I came here with one of my best friends and a wonderful $35 gift card. Never being a fan of the main entrees I stuck with appetizers and got the buffalo chicken strips with blue cheese dip and celery sticks. My friend got the nachos. Man on man was that portion huge! We also got some cheese cake and a strawberry short cake to go.  Our server was very kind and helped us order to our gift card so we didn't go over. She also explained everything that came with our orders, partially because I couldn't see the menu. Overall, a very good experience was ruined because of the lighting. I don't know about you all but I'd like to see what I have on my plate."
Mark L.,"West Hollywood, CA",274,423,57,4.0,4/19/2010,Huge selection of all different kinds of food. Service is quick and friendly and the food quality is great. I usually go in the late afternoon and there is no wait.
C A.,"Sacramento, CA",0,12,1,4.0,8/25/2014,"Good food, big portions.  Deserts are amazing!   Love their cheesecakes!  Can get very busy.  Service tends to be very good for such a busy atmosphere.   Not the place for a quiet dinner, but a great place to hang-out with family or friends."
Leopard S.,"Sacramento, CA",2,336,53,3.0,6/30/2010,"The only good thing about this place is their cheesecake, which is expensive. I purchased two pieces of cheesecake to take home and it was $15-for two pieces of cheesecake!  The ambiance sucks, mainly because its usually SO LOUD in there I can't hear myself think. Every time I've went the waiter/waitress' service was lacking. They need to be better staffed so I'm not waiting 15 minutes for a drink refill.  I'd rather take the cheesecake to go, and for food, eat somewhere else. Maybe its just the acoustics, but it is ridiculously loud in there."
