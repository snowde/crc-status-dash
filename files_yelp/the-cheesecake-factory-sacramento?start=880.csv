Theresa M.,"Sacramento, CA",1,11,2,3.0,4/1/2013,"Heard many positive comments about this restaurant chain. So we thought what the heck, lets do Easter lunch this year. We waited 15 minutes to be seated (not bad). The waiter was nice but not overly nice. I believe she was over worked by the long hours and the many customers she had to service. The food was ok but not great. Expect to be seated very close to the next table. This is a turn and burn type of restaurant. To sum it all up, it was just so bland."
Margaret B.,"Sacramento, CA",3,32,4,1.0,1/13/2014,"First of all, I have never been a big fan of this restaurant.  The food is bland and the only decent thing there is the cheesecake which is just horrible for one's health.  BUT IF YOU HAVE A PARTY OF MORE THAN 2 PEOPLE, BE PREPARED TO WAIT 2+ HOURS!  They will not take a reservation and we had a party of 10 people.  I was told to call at 4:45pm so that when we got there at 5:30 pm the wait would not be long.  YEAH RIGHT!  I got there at 5:15pm and was told no more than 1 hour wait.  After 1 1/2 hours, we had to speak to a manager who told us that they made an error and put another large party at ""our table"" and we had to wait for them to finish.  Why in the world would you just put us at the next available table!?!  The staff was incredibly rude about the situation on top of it!  There was another large party of 16, that had been waiting for over 2 1/2 hours when we were finally seated close to 7pm.   That was my family's last & final visit to that place.  There are a LOT more restaurants in the Sacramento area that are willing to take a reservation for a large party and will make sure you are treated well."
Laura P.,"Sacramento, CA",0,4,,5.0,3/31/2013,"On Saturday, my husband was taking a test at Cal Expo.  When he was done we decided to get a late lunch.  We've never been to The Cheesecake Factory before so we picked it. It was about 3pm when we arrived. We only had to wait about  2 or 3 minutes for a table. I was surprised by how big the menu was, but I don't think it was too big since it had breakfast, lunch, dinner and Sunday brunch.  We decided on the Vietnamese Tacos for our appetizer and I ordered the Factory meatloaf lunch favorites.  My husband chose the Chinese Chicken Salad. The tacos were excellent,  maybe my favorite of the meal.  My meatloaf was great as well.  My husband's salad was huge -- I thought the lunch portions were generous. I didn't eat all mine in order to save room for cheesecake.  The service was excellent our waitress was friendly, sweet and knowledgeable. I had lots of questions about the menu; she answered all of them with out any problems.  She definitely helped make the meal enjoyable.  I asked for things; I got them promptly.  I never had to ask for water.  It was refilled throughout the meal.  Since I was only drinking water, that was nice.   I will definitely will be back."
Jess D.,"Placerville, CA",3,24,3,3.0,12/27/2013,"Went here last night with a semi big group, bout 8 of us. I thoroughly enjoy the food here. I always indulge on the shrimp BLT. We waited for about 35 min with our party to be sat, which wasn't really an issue because we (my boyfriend and I) each ordered a drink. Crown and coke, the same drink we enjoy ANYWHERE we go out to. And by the time we had been sat to order we had about finished our first drink and ordered a 2nd. As our drinks came I began to enjoy mine, but my boyfriend insisted his was not crown and coke. He was going to settle, but at $10 a drink I felt the need to speak up. As the waitress returned I explained the situation, she began to say, ""no I watched him open a new bottle and pour it"", my boyfriend didn't argue and she left. He tried to continue sipping it, but just couldn't handle it as he said it tasted like spiced rum. Point blank I tried his drink and in fact it WAS NOT crown and coke and I found someone who actually cared and returned the drink. Our waitress returned and fed the same excuse she did before. But with the return that she would comp it since we weren't satisfied. I can't handle people like that. You work in the food industry, even if it WAS crown and coke, if we didn't like the taste, I believe you would make a new one or even better find a resolution so both parties feel fair!"
Drew T.,"Rocklin, CA",285,879,3018,3.0,4/12/2008,"It was alright. I'd rather go to Nordstroms restaurant and avoid the wait. Unless I'm in SF then the view is amazing and worth it. I'm pretty sure the new one at the Roseville Galleria will put this one to shame with the hideous wait times, bad service, and slow cooking. I did love the mojito I had here though and the cheesecake kind of rocked. I'd rather eat pie and ice cream though. I'm a cheap date."
Latosha L.,"Fresno, CA",323,136,289,3.0,7/18/2011,"If you wanna eat And be full and satisfied then this is the spot for you. They give you so much food! I had the New Orleans shrimp with white rice And oh my goodness, the flavors were amazing. The sauce that the shrimp came in was to die for, I ate every single bite (which I later regretted because it was so much food and I was like, disgustingly full...lol). The mound of white rice that came with it made me full even faster.  The cons: I came with A large group of about 18 and was not very happy at All with the 85 dollar included gratuity that came on the tab. Call me a cheap skate and oldshool but I thought tips were optional and awarded to wAiters and waitresses that went above and beyond to actually deserve the tip? Sorry, wasn't feeling that At all. Also, some of our party was a little tardy for dinner so when they got there, we had to shift around the table to fit them in. This was after the waiter had come to take everyone's drink orders.    So when he came back, he was extremely frustrated because it messed up the orderS he had alreAdy written down because I guess they were in a specific order. I thought waiters were never supposed to let us see 'em sweat?! His frustration with everyone made ME frustrated and added to my irritation with the included gratuity at the end of the tab. He also was hesitant when we asked him to split the tab for us so everyone could pay separately. Later I found out that the reason he put up such a fuss about the tab was because If he divided the tabs, the gratuity wouldn't hAve been included. Ugh! He made up some bs lie about splitting each tab would take like 5 mins each. Yeah right! Other than the waiter service we received, this place was great. The dark setting And ambience makes it a great place for a first date or romantic dinner. It was clean, roomy and well organized.  Last but not least, the red velvet cheesecake and white chocolate macadamia nut caramel cheesecakes were delish. The latter was a little  (well actually a LOT) on the sweet side but it was good. And like I said, the portions were huge. It's well worth the 7 to 8 dollars per slice."
Darren M.,"Sacramento, CA",92,507,35,5.0,10/29/2009,"BUFFALO BLASTS FTW oh and bbq chicken pizza , i'm  a bit of a picky eater but man their pasta's were unbelievably plain , yuck"
Niah N.,"Walnut Creek, CA",27,347,2,4.0,4/2/2012,"Popped a bottle of bubbled with some friends and had some stuffed mushrooms, fried artichoke, beet salad, and crab dip. I was anti the artichokes but other than that its good stuff."
Chris C.,"Elk Grove, CA",8,63,8,5.0,5/9/2014,Great service! Our server made sure we had everything we needed and even paid for a cheesecake for our friend.   The food was very tasty and fresh.
Diedre N.,"Carmichael, CA",28,28,,3.0,7/10/2012,"Meh...the best thing about this place is their cheese triangles! Soooo stringy and cheesey. I swear though, the seats are so uncomfortable which make it hard for you to want to stay for an extended period of time. By the time dessert comes around your bum is asleep and you'd just assume grab the tab and run for the door. I go maybe once a year but I just assume do take out for the cheesey triangles and cheesecake."
Jim H.,"Sacramento, CA",23,134,9,4.0,3/19/2012,Although I believe this place to be a bit overpriced I must confess that we had a great dinner there. I had the Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp. The sauce was incredible. Mixed with some brown rice and a little mango salsa it was a flavor delight. The black beans were ok. The plantains were an excellent touch. My wife ordered the Chargrilled Coulotte Steak. She ordered it med and unfortunately it came to the table med/well. No pink. Our server stood by while she cut it to make sure it was what she wanted. It wasn't so he took it back to the kitchen to replace it. The manager came by the table to apologize and took my plate back to be replaced so we could eat together. Nice customer care. We finished off sharing a slice of Lemoncello Cream Torte. We left pleased and with full bellies!
Mark F.,"Sacramento, CA",0,6,,4.0,1/18/2013,"Food is pretty awesome here, everything is a bit pricey but worth it, overall its a great place. The service is polite as well but sometimes a small wait because its crowded. Feels pretty fancy place to eat at."
Inga B.,"Sacramento, CA",3,155,9,2.0,10/19/2011,"Ok I would of given a 1star but I love their buffalo blasts n carrot cake cheesecake!   I went with my daughter, ordered appetizer and after that we were IGNORED THE entire time!  we were dining on the patio, and other people were eating at tables around us, being helped, not sure why we were ignored.  I couldnt get anyone's attention for the life of me! I wanted more ranch and nope, noone helped. After counting 15minutes, one girl came to refill my water, I finally was soo pissed off I asked for my check and a box,  I didnt even order the Blueberry Mojito I wanted or slice of cheesecake!   That's how mad I was.. :(  One thing I can't stand is bad service...I've been there before and the only complaint I had was that they don't accept  reservations. OH WELL!!!!!"
Dane M.,"Sacramento, CA",43,22,,4.0,1/5/2013,"We come here about once a month or so because they have consistently good food and service.  The cheesecake factory has a huge variety of menu items and are able to produce quality food in a timely manner.  Our waiter was very on top of things tonight, some of the best service we have recieved in a long time.  You may have to wait for a table, especially during peak hours, so plan accordingly.  We came in around 9 PM and there was still a 15 min wait."
Ricky K.,"Sacramento, CA",24,37,,5.0,8/2/2010,i love this restaurant because of all the Delicious food that makes me soo fool :o I enjoy the variety on the menu too :P Highlights: chicken salad sandwich strawberry pineapple smoothie
Sarah W.,"Sacramento, CA",105,11,10,5.0,5/16/2013,"There is always at least a thirty minute wait to be seated but it's well worth it. There is a huge menu offering several varieties of food such as teriyaki chicken on rice, chicken enchiladas, hamburgers, Alfredo pasta, salmon, and much much more. The drink menu is also very impressive. Although, there have been several occasions where I've observed the bartender over pouring the drinks. I once received a rum and coke that was clear, as if no coke was added. The cheesecake menu is as delicious as it sounds. I always end up taking a slice or two of cheesecake home to indulge in later. They have a large kid's friendly menu. This comes in handy when I take my toddler because he's a very picky eater. The waiters, waitresses, and hosts are all very friendly, attentive, and courteous to their customers. The restaurant itself is very clean, classy, and spacious. It is a restaurant someone can easily go to dressed casually or dressed to impress. They offer intimate tables for couples both indoors and outdoors. They also offer large tables and booths for larger parties and families. This, Olive Garden, and Chiles are my three favorite restaurants to go to on a date with my husband, out with friends, and with the entire family. Of course one can't help but think of Penny from The Big Bang Theory when they go to Cheesecake Factory because that's where she works in the show. :-p"

Aaron D.,"Anaheim, CA",421,415,27,4.0,3/14/2009,"My first Cheesecake factory experience was here.  My wife has spotted several Sacramento Kings dining here - so well knowns must show up some time.  I love the low light. I really enjoy the chocolate cake. Have never been overly impressed by the cheesecake.  I have really loved the fish I have eaten here. And the service has always been superb. I have never had a bad staff experience here. Or at any cheesecake factory.  There are always more gourmet and cool choices than cheesecake factory. But, if you are looking to kick back and have some dessert this is a great place."
Davis T.,"Long Beach, CA",1,47,,3.0,9/25/2009,"I have been to Cheesecake Factory twice, one in Sacramento and one in Anaheim. I order the tuna in Sacramento, the food was warm (not hot), big portion and almost could not finish it.  The Anaheim was Mahi-mahi, it was a little too dry.  My wife had a pasta, and she did not quite like it. Never try the cheesecake there, sorry! my score was 5.5 out of 10."
kassidy j.,"Union City, CA",1,14,,3.0,7/12/2010,"I don't know what we did deserve such a (I don't know if I can say completely horrible.. But) unfriendly server. Right from the beginning, she had this vibe that didn't want to serve us. I felt like asking for extra sauce or anything necessary was just out an in convenience to her. Which is why I deducted a star. Maybe I'm too observant but I notice that when she finishes up serving the tables around us and has to make her away pass us, shed avoid us like the plague. There were no ""how do you guys like the food?"" or ""do you guys need anything?"" or ""if you need anything let me know."" None of that whatsoever. Therefore asking for my extra ranch seemed like such a burden.  I ordered a factory burger that came out okay. I made a mistake by not mentioning what bread I'd like so instead it came out with a baguette. No foul. A friendly server in a restaurant like this one is key to me. Hopefully, the next time I come back here, I'd have servers like the many other times I've come here."
