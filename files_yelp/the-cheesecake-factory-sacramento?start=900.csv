Gabby D.,"Sacramento, CA",62,32,15,4.0,8/2/2011,"Went here on a date, it was pretty good. Great service, good food, and even seated us in a private area.  Cons: Long wait, it tends to be very busy."
Christopher N.,"Elk Grove, CA",169,196,146,4.0,4/13/2011,"Maybe I was jumping the gun when I looked at this place and thought it was just some building sitting in front of the theater and their food must be only cheesecake.  Going here after the movies was probably the best decision I've made this month because I've never been so wrong.  I ordered the Fettuccini Alfredo and it was no less than satisfying.  The flavor bursts in your mouth and the pesto accents it wonderfully  Upon the great meal, I decide to challenge the place to it's name by ordering the cheesecake.. just to take it up a notch, I order the RED VELVET Cheesecake.  By golly, if i hadn't known better, they have earned their name and a place in my heart."
Nguyet K.,"West Sacramento, CA",129,342,611,3.0,12/8/2011,"We decided to come here for a late dinner. We knew the cheesecake factory was still open (past midnight) and we were all super hungry, so it wasn't too far from Cal Expo. Its a chain restaurant... but at least they have a wide selection, and with a large group (12+). It would usually accommodate everyone's preference in food. (+1 star) The food is good (sometime over seasoned to my preference), the service is okay (sometimes bad if its too crowded), the portion size is huge ( you have to take food home, or share with a friend). I been to cheesecake factory many many times, and I have not tried everything on their menu. (+1 star) However, I love the dessert menu. There are many times, I come into the restaurant just to buy a cheesecake and that's it. I'm not a bad fan of regular classic cheesecake, but chocolate... YUM YUM. Strawberry is delicious too. (+1 star). I would totally recommend a cheesecake for a birthday cake instead of a traditional cake."
Stephanie F.,"Fair Oaks, CA",144,188,55,4.0,4/18/2009,Went back again 2 more times in the span of 2 weeks.  I had the spicy crispy sandwich which was very good and my friend had a beet with goat cheese apples and walnuts.  Yeah I am a new fan of goat cheese and beets now.  Our server was super nice and helpful.   The 3rd time I went with my fiance and he ordered a salad and a...beer?  yeah 8 dollars for a newcastle... thats pushing it a little.  I ordered the Louisiana chicken with pasta. I am becoming a huge fan of their chicken!!!  Our server wasn't as helpful.  She left the menus at our table (which was a very small table btw)  so we sat there not knowing what or how to get rid of them.  I finally just put them on top the ledge we sat by. That irritated me but I am picky when it comes to customer service.   overall i am liking this eatery more and more.  Every meal has been great and the service has been good too.
Anji W.,"San Francisco, CA",785,202,1755,4.0,11/30/2011,I came here a couple times for a chill hang out with the girls. The drinks are always good and the food is always to my liking. Dessert is always finished. I'd say this is a pretty god place for some good times and laughs with friends.
M G.,"Sacramento, CA",3,50,,1.0,1/27/2012,"This place is going downhill fast. Whenever I order anything but a salad, I'm sorely disappointed. Yesterday I ordered the fish tacos and they served me fish that I thought was RAW. My friend and I tried with all our might to tear this fish in half... and we were unable to! (And we're strong girls!). Anyhow, the food was sent back and I felt sick all night.  The manager swears it was cooked but just the tail end so it was ""tough."" I'm not planning on going back there anytime soon."
Alma M.,"Elk Grove, CA",3,131,5,2.0,8/2/2011,"Food was good but the service sucked.. bringing my rating to two stars. It was not even that busy. I think our server was just lazy. He didn't even provide any refills. Although, he was very attentive to these ladies a few tables down. We had to ask a different server for refills and utensils."
Damon M.,"Sacramento, CA",40,22,12,3.0,2/27/2012,"Been to the cheesecake factory a few times and never really have been won over. The menu is just too extensive, the service is never that great, and really the one thing that is great is the cheesecake. I recommend just getting the cheesecake to go, although the counter service sucks. Good luck."
Mandy M.,"Sacramento, CA",65,98,2,2.0,2/22/2014,"I've eaten in these restaurants in southern California and Arizona and never experienced anything quite like this. The entrees were good, although not sure it's a really great idea to put sharp skewers through a kid's meal. And the waiter was wonderful. But the managers were awful and made us feel like they didn't want us there. I asked for a booth because I was with my toddler son and they were not really interested in accommodating us although it wasn't that busy and it took a long time to get the table we needed. Then we did order cheesecake, and it was 1 to 1 and 1/2 inches wide at the widest part, about a quarter of the serving compared to all the other Cheesecake restaurants I've been to. Yes, it's rich, but that's why we had half of the slice put in a box to go. But when I saw it was so much smaller than the servings at the other restaurants, I shouldn't have bothered.  I'm talking 2 or 3 bites and you are done with half of it... . Very, very disappointing. Not recommended because of management attitude (NOT family friendly and very superior) and also portion size of the cheesecake. Waiter was wonderful, but not sure management was a fan of that."
Kristin E.,"Sacramento, CA",16,147,9,4.0,6/2/2011,Well I think the menu here is pretty darn awesome and seriously one dinner can feed you for like 3 meals! The portions are huge!! They bring bread to the table and it is super yummy! Be prepared because there is usually a wait. Marking is okay... and they do offer valet if you want to pay for it. Oh and also it is VERY loud in here for some reason so if you are taking someone out who doenst like loud background noise this isnt the place. Other then that everything is just awesome!
Alison W.,"San Jose, CA",413,1590,952,3.0,6/2/2009,"I remember what a big deal it was when this location first opened at Arden Fair - crazy busy. And my mom usually hates crowded American places. But we had a gift certificate so decided to hit it up. We were actually seated right away so that's a plus. I rarely ever make it to Cheesecake Factory early so I ordered off the brunch menu, which I think they offer only on Sunday mornings. And this was the first time I actually noticed the wait staff all dressed in white - maybe because it was daytime.  I got my usual strawberry lemonade. It hurts to think about it sometimes as it costs almost $5. But I try to drink as many glasses as possible to get my money's worth. So I ordered the French toast. My brother got the salad/pizza lunch special and my mom had the chicken picatta lunch special. I, of course, filled up on the rye bread before our food got there so the French toast was probably not as appetizing as it could've been as it's basically just more bread going into my tummy. But I found it drenched in too much syrup so it was actually soggy. And they gave you extra syrup on the side as well. I should've just split the salad/pizza with my brother, because as I mentioned in my other Cheesecake Factory review, it's just huge. The chicken was alright but I'm not a white meat fan, I guess. We were stuffed but had to top it all off with a slice of cheesecake. My mom isn't a fan of the fancy ones so we just got the plain fresh strawberry topped ones. Scrumptious - they definitely know how to do cheesecakes."
james D.,"Sacramento, CA",0,14,4,4.0,4/9/2014,"Love this place. Yesterday when I took my wife out we were surprised when an appetizer had a bone in it! My wife hurt her tooth, hopefully just a temporary ache, but the Staff was great. Rachel immediately brought over Dandy the manager and he was prompt, courteous, and genuinely cared about making us feel taken care of. Comped the meal and appetizer. We paid for the drinks and dessert, otherwise I would of given them 5 stars."
E P.,"San Francisco, CA",20,9,,2.0,8/29/2013,Food was good but service was pretty bad. Server was gone and didn't refill our drinks. It wasn't even busy today.
Joe S.,"Sacramento, CA",23,29,1,5.0,2/5/2014,this place is money!  ahi caparccio..endive salad..chicken costelleta....hefe'..cheesecake....everyrhing fro scratch
Mika T.,"Sacramento, CA",0,5,1,1.0,5/16/2015,"Worst service ever! Went to dinner for a girls night, food service was extremely slow. As we wrapped up dinner the waiter slowly took our leftovers to be boxed up, however he never brought the food back. After returning with our check (in full) we discovered that he had actually tossed out food in the garbage. There was no way I was paying for food that the waiter decided to throw away because of his absent mind. We brought this mistake to his attention and his response was that he didn't know what happened. Time was going by and it was time to go now, so we simply refused to pay for what we didn't eat, however, we should not have had to be the ones to tell them this, the manager should have comped  it at his own discretion. After it all, the waiter conveniently told his manager he was ""going to faint"" which we believe the manager was making excuses for him. As someone who works in customer service, I can honestly say this place has the worst manager and customer service."
Ngoc L.,"San Jose, CA",346,394,5502,4.0,4/9/2011,"I came here a few time with some friends and I had a good dinner every time. We usually have to wait, but the wait is never that long for us. My favorite dish here is the Habachi Steak..it never fails. I tried their tiramisiu and didn't like it. I like their strawberry cheesecake the most."
T N.,"Davis, CA",53,21,,3.0,2/23/2012,"I like this place, but it's pretty busy all the time. Their tiramisu cheesecake is soOOOOoo good. The food is okay, but if you like pasta you should definitely head down the street to Buca di Peppo for pasta."
Luiza S.,"Olathe, KS",7,7,2,1.0,5/7/2014,This is the worst Cheesecake Factory I have ever been to!! We stood at the front entrance for almost 10 minutes waiting to talk to somebody. Waiters and servers kept passing us by and no one was interested in talking to us. We ended up leaving the place without getting seated. We will never be back at this place.
Chris H.,"Sacramento, CA",2,20,4,1.0,6/8/2009,"I went to the Cheesecake Factory on a Sunday with my parents. I had lived in Sacramento and San Francisco both for years yet never been to one so I agreed to go out of curiosity.  We got in and sat down we were greeted with a menu packed full of dentist and plastic surgery advertisements one of which featured a photo who looked like a 1960's version of the Joker from Batman. None of which I found very appealing while I'm trying to look for food. While flipping threw every other page to see what I wanted I spotted the ""Cajun Jambalaya Pasta""  thinking it sounded good I ordered it.  After sitting there and watching people around us get there food even though there were more of them and they arrived later then us and staring at my empty cup of Coke the food finally arrived. I was greeted with a giant bowl of rice with chicken, 3 pieces of shrimp and what looked like tomato paste.If this was ""Jambalaya"" then I was Tom Brokaw. I have gotten better from those frozen dinner kits you get at the grocery store.  Figuring ""what the hell"" and deciding not to ruin the good time my parents appeared to be having since we don't go out together all that often I left it alone and asked for some Tabasco sauce. After about 15 minutes and asking 2 waiters I finally got Tabasco and was able to choke down the rest of my food.  I will never eat here again, between the loudness, the bad food, the horrible service and the amusement park type atmosphere I was seriously disappointed.  I've had better food and service at Denny's."
Squirrel C.,"Hollywood, CA",281,430,72,4.0,10/30/2008,"BIGGEST PORTIONS EVER! Now before you start telling me how I should have tried out some local food spots in Sactown instead of going to a chain, let me preface...when you're with a co-worker or someone that's not a big foodie or if it's a professional meal, it's hard to suggest the whole in the wall out of the way ""cash only"" places for instance.  So...on this trip to Sacramento, I was with a co-worker and I thought a safe choice was Cheesecake Factory.  We were seated after a three-minute wait, which the hostess originally said would take 15 mins. even though there was only one other group ahead of us.  I think they just say that.   My thoughts landed on the BAJA CHICKEN TACOS, which are Three Soft Corn Tortillas Filled with Spicy Chicken, Cheese, Avocado Cream,Tomato and Cilantro.Served with Black Beans, Rice and Guacamole.  Talk about ginormous portions.  I would have ate one and taken the rest home if I could have.   Maybe it was a result of the one beer and pre-dinner bread that I had before my meal, but I was friggin' stuffed. All I could do was get back to my hotel room and lay on my bed like a beached whale.  blah!"
