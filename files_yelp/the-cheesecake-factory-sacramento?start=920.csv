Mercedes G.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",156,59,,4.0,4/18/2009,"I finally went to Cheesecake Factory for the first time like, 2 weeks ago...and I've been twice since. Their fish tacos are THAT GOOD. Sure, they're a little pricey (hence 4 stars), but that just means I can't go as often as I'd like. Plus, their service is seriously amazing. Drink refills are a big deal for me (see: my BJ's review), so when we were getting refills when our drinks were barely half empty, that is means for a good review in and of itself. Too bad I'm about to start a diet which means I won't get to try some of their amazing looking cheesecakes. But that's alright, I guess - $6-$8 for a slice?? I'm cool."
A K.,"Grass Valley, CA",162,77,23,4.0,10/21/2011,"I've only been here twice. Once when I was in LA and the food was great and another time more recently on valentines day a few years ago. I got a fish dish, it was amazing. I also got the spinach dip appetizer that was also very tastey. The wait was horrendous but that's to be expected on Valentine's day with no reservations. We were seated outside and the fresh air was nice with the heater lights."
Judy Z.,"Sacramento, CA",5,31,,3.0,4/24/2010,I went there today for a birthday dinner party. The wait was okay-ish because there was a high school that had prom this evening.  When we got seated everything went well BUT when we got our food everything went very slow.....the waitress was barely around when we needed her and this one chick that brought out our food was very unmannerly. She seemed to be annoyed of us asking for extra plates and some water. I mean who else are we suppose to ask our WAITRESS wasnt around...... The pasta dish thing i got was pretty good. 3 people told me what they ordered were not as good as expected to be.  i might come back here in the future but not on some high schools prom night. until then this is all i have to say.
Michael B.,"Manteca, CA",1,4,,5.0,4/18/2012,"This was my first time ever eating at a Cheesecake Factory and I will be going back again soon.  Had the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp with brown rice. No joke, one of the greatest meals I have ever had. The wait staff was fantastic in always keeping our drinks filled and bread on the table. I have to say, the wheat bread there is phenomenal. All around great experience."
Steve R.,"Carmichael, CA",16,164,83,5.0,11/2/2011,I want to mention again how awesome the Cheesecake Factory  to go service is. They will give you extra whatever you want at no charge. They make sure that your experience is as good to go as it would be eating there. Ive been to a couple other restaurants lately that could learn a thing or two from this place.
TeaBoy A.,"Antelope, OR",6,110,10,4.0,8/21/2009,This place seem to have improved! its always so busy tho don't know why. yesterday i was here waitress was very friendly and nice. the food were serve quickly. but everything seem to be soo loud..iono what it was.. but it was very hard to hear the person in front of you. but yes the food is good! might have to drop couple of bill as they are kinda expensive too..
Jo M.,"Orinda, CA",14,157,12,4.0,10/29/2008,"My husband and I  enjoyed our meal.  We went around 4pm and found out that between the hours of 3-6pm, if we sat in the bar section, we could order smaller versions of their appetizers for a very reasonable price. We decided instead of ordering an entree from the regular menu, we would order a few appetizers.  That was a great decision because we were able to see what appetizers we liked and what we' will  avoid in the future.  The appetizers made a great meal and the fact each dish was a different flavor made the meal memorable.   We ordered the following: 1   ROADSIDE SLIDERS      Bite-sized Burgers on Mini-Buns Served w/ Grilled Onions, Pickles      and Ketchup VERY TASTY - would order again, but  as good as it was, it took a back seat to the other appetizers 2. CHICKEN POT STICKERS-       Oriental Dumplings Pan-Fried in the Classic Tradition. Served with       Soy Dipping Sauce       WONDERFUL FLAVOR - would order again and would consider ordering two of these 3.  VIETNAMESE SHRIMP SUMMER ROLLS -      Delicate Rice Paper Rolled Around Asparagus, Shiitake Mushrooms,     Carrots, Rice Noodles, Green Onion, Cilantro and Shrimp. Served     Chilled and not Fried  THIS IS THE BOMB!!  Very tasty, very fresh and the garlic sauce was light and  flavorful.  Would order two of these next time. 4.  FRIED CALAMARI      Served with Garlic Dip and Cocktail Sauce NOT GREASY, WONDERFULLY LIGHT AND TASTY - would order again. 5.  SPICY AHI TEMPURA ROLLS            Fresh Raw Ahi Tuna Seasoned with Green Onions, Spicy Soy Sauce,       Ginger & Garlic Wrapped in Nori and Flash fried Tempura Style  BLAND FLAVOR- would not order again.  The description sounded great and looked great, however, from the first bite, the first thing you taste is the sauce and nothing else. 6.  CHOPPED SALAD       A Delicious Blend of Chopped Romaine Lettuce, Grilled Chicken,        Tomato, Avocado, Corn, Bacon, Blue Cheese, Apple and our House NICE FLAVOR and complimented the rest of the appetizers.  Would order again. We ended the meal  ordering two slices of cheesecake and two double espressos.  We ended up taking the ROADSIDE SLIDERS and the two slices of cheesecake home.  We love The Cheesecake Factory in Sacramento at the Arden Fair Mall.  Our server was fantastic, very attentive without being intrusive.  We'll be back."
Alex G.,"Sacramento, CA",160,67,23,2.0,10/29/2010,I am not a fan of this place. Ive eaten here on several occasion and never not once was satisfied with my meal. Stick with the cheesecake i guess
Patricia S.,"Carmichael, CA",19,93,56,3.0,8/9/2011,Too expensive. Portions unreasonably large.  Long wait for a table.  But it was a Friday night.  I had the Portabella Burger which was great but difficult to handle.  I don't eat burgers with a knife and fork.
John L.,"Sacramento, CA",0,5,,2.0,6/9/2012,"Good service by wait staff. Food came out slow during an early dinner service that was not very busy. I ordered fettuccine Alfredo and received pasta cabonara, my pasta dish was overcooked and was not good at all, chicken enchiladas were ok, not much chicken or sauce, black beans and cilantro lime rice were good. Nutritional values revealed shocking amounts of sodium and saturated fat content. Spicy Thai chicken has over 4000 mg of salt. Go there for cheesecake, not dinner."
LaSheyett T.,"McClellan Air Force Base, CA",0,10,,5.0,4/2/2013,I went there yesterday with family and we had great service and the food was great. I had the Grande Burrito with Black beans. I totally recommend.
Luigi D.,"Sacramento, CA",52,24,4,3.0,5/29/2012,"Went to this restaurant with my wife today, as we often do when we go out to Arden Fair Mall.  I discovered that if you order from their ""Skinny Menul"" that is exactly what you get, whatever is delivered to your table is ""skinny"".  I ordered the chicken salad sandwich which came on toasted bread.  It came with a salad that was enough for three people.  However, the chicken salad in the sandwich was amazingly skimpy.  I'm not exaggerating.  There was literally a minuscule amount of chicken, just a few flakes and a huge amount of lettuce topped with a slice of tomato.  The bread also fell apart in attempting to eat it.  I also had a bowl of lentil soup that was very good and, of course, the bread they deliver to the table is delicious.  I ordered their ""house Merlot"" which cost 7.95 for half a wine glass.  Good, but it cost two dollars shy of the entrée.  Hmmm.  When I commented to the waitress, who was very pleasant, she explained that the sandwich was ""skimpy"" because they have to match it to the calorie count that is given to the sandwich.  Hmmm, again.  It could have stood a lot more chicken, increased the calorie count slightly decreased the salad amount, thus the dressing on the salad and it would have been fine and getting really close to the assigned calorie count. I'll think twice about ordering from the ""Skinny Menu"" next time."
Maria R.,"Stockton, CA",0,5,,1.0,2/13/2016,"if i could give 0 stars i would.. it was my first time coming here with my boyfriend today from stockton to enjoy a valentines dinner to try somthing differnt but it was the far worst experience ever.. never have i had this kind of customer service ever.. the waitress name was ""bri"" at first i thought maybe she was just busy helping others then i realized she didn't give a shit about serving us. when she came to get out order she rushed us snatched the menu out of our hands didn't explain nothing about the menu she didn't greet us but she did certainly help all the other people with a big smile. everytime she came to our table she had a stink face acted like we wernt good enough to be there. i asked her for a sprite she brought it and said ""oh i'd definitely be charging you for that"" umm ok like if i didn't know that.. the people sitting next tk us got all her attention served there bread asked if they were doing ok if there food was good not once did she ask us. our fries were cold tasted really old like if they were sitting there for a while.. i asked her if we could order desserts she didn't even offer us a menu she acted like i knew the desserts off the top of my head she never brought me the menu. luckily a manager was close by and i told her the customer service sucked and the fries were cold. i have worked with customers for 6 yrs now not once have i treated them wrong or made them feel unwanted i make them.feel comfortable and greet them with a smile and always ask if they need anything so that they want to come back. paying customers always come first. maybe someone should check her about how she treats her customers and stop worrying about how the person looks or judges them like if they don't got money.. bri i just paid for your minimum wage hour  and make sure you treat ur customers with respect because of them u have a job. your customer service sucks your rude judgemental, and your ignorant...  i never want to return to the cheesecake factory because of you."
Gabriela U.,"Elk Grove, CA",5,6,,5.0,5/23/2012,This is one of my Favorite Places The Food is amazing. I was just blown away by the architecture .. I ordered my favorites: Luau Salad and Reese's Peanut Butter Cheesecake :) The Cheesecake factory is a pretty good damn restaurant but at times it can be a bit crowded..
Ben R.,"Fairfield, CA",9,30,,5.0,9/18/2008,"I like going to this place.  The Bar has awesome customer service. When I talk to my friends, their biggest complaint is the price.  But expect to pay good money for good food especially if it has the name ""cheese cake factory"". It's a good place to eat and the employees are polite and sociable. The drinks are incredible too.  5 stars"
Mike C.,"Sacramento, CA",86,50,9,3.0,2/16/2012,Ok first time ever eating here. Very surprised great service and good food. Wow
George L.,"Granite Bay, CA",8,64,,3.0,1/27/2015,"Food was ok and was typical for a large restaurant chain, though it was disappointing to discover that the restaurant had removed from the menu a few items that were actually superior in flavors and overall quality.  Our main beef was over the fact that it was late at night, most of the restaurant was empty, and yet the staff chose to seat us in a small area -- almost a separate room -- that was dominated by a huge, round table that, on this occasion, was occupied by a large and very noisy group.  Everyone at the round table was out to establish him- or herself as the most boisterous life-of-the-party, and conversation at our own table quickly proved difficult.  Several other couples, who arrived after we did, were likewise crammed into this portion of the building.  They briefly celebrated like we did once the large group finally decided to leave.  The group had clearly been on the premises for a long while by the time we arrived, and their noise level must have been obvious to the restaurant staff.  In our opinion, the staff should have tried to do a better job of assigning us an enjoyably quiet place to enjoy our meal."
Enrique C.,"Palmdale, CA",62,4,,5.0,8/25/2011,"The service was BEYOND EXCELLENT!  It was a bit of a wait to get a table because the place was packed, but it was so worth it. Our waitress was fantastic and mas extremely helpful and attentive when it came to making the right choice for a meal, and boy was she right in every single meal option, my mouth was delighted at all the food I ordered. Next time I come back to Sacramento i will definitely come back!"
Lulu W.,"Albany, CA",58,119,159,4.0,5/24/2009,"So I came here with a few coworkers last week. I've been here a few times and usually we would have to wait about 30-45 minutes for a table. However this time even though it was dinner time, we only waited about 5 minutes!!  So I had the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta (extra extra spicy!!)... they were actually able to make it spicy this time. It was delicious, filled with jumbo shrimp and chicken. I didn't even have to ask for a side of sauce and the waiter made sure to bring me an extra bowl!! The portions are large, so make sure you bring your appetite!!  So since it was dinner, we decided to also have a drink. I ordered the Tropical Martini... I think I have found my new favorite drink at the Cheesecake Factory! It's vodka shaken with passion fruit, mango and pineapple. It was very delicious.  My coworkers ordered Cosmopolitans and Asian Pear Martinis. I had a sip of theirs and it was also good, but I would rather stick with the one I ordered.  For dessert I ordered the Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake. It was rich and creamy, if you are a chocolate lover, this is a must order item!  Overall this experience was a good one, I would come here again."
Phil K.,"Sacramento, CA",156,138,5,2.0,3/1/2011,"WHY???? WHY DOES THIS PLACE ALWAYS HAVE A LINE OUT THE DOOR.  Ok, i understand its a big chain restaurant and it is in a mall for god's sakes, but why????  The food is beyond basic and inconsistent.  The service (when you are finally seated) is mediocre at best, its over priced, and you are literally in a line that snakes around the door just to be seated!  I will never hate on a place for being busy ( god forbid the place is good and people enjoy it), but why????  its no more than an overpriced, glorified chilis!!"
