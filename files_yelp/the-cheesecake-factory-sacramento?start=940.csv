Alani N.,"Elk Grove, CA",50,71,98,4.0,7/12/2011,Love the Boston appetizer salad- amazing to share! Club sandwich on wheat with avocado is fabulous- but twice now my sandwich had to be remade with wheat because it came out on white. I think the Cheesecake Factory must have the best ranch on the face of the planet - I'd come here to dunk my fries any day! My fiancé had the mushroom burger and he said it's very good- it's the second time he's ordered it. He says it has just the right amount of mushrooms and loves the toasted bun. He also orders the sweet potato fries- he said they're some of the best he's had- and of course dunks them in the awesome ranch! We also got a slice of red velvet cheesecake to go - but from past experience- it's worth the cost!! The only reason we didn't rate 5 stars is the bread issue with my club. Servers were great!
Aleasha N.,"Woodland, CA",47,45,4,4.0,3/21/2009,"This place has really, really cool decor. The food is delicious! Cheesecake is my favorite thing to eat there; go figure from the name of the place. LoL! But they have just about everything you can think of that would be good as cheesecake. I like all of them that I have tried. It is a good place to take someone for a romantic dinner; just make sure you sit in the room they have because the main restaurant is kind of crowded, so it isn't very private. I would definitely recommend going there!  :)Shanda"
Romi L.,"Sacramento, CA",10,21,,3.0,12/28/2010,I went there a while back and had their scampi which tasted way too garlicy (yes its possible ;) and the server was nice enough to replace my order with something delicious. It was the meal with the fried plantains which were awesome! Their desserts are to die for! Def worth a shot... One down is no reservations...
Julia N.,"Sacramento, CA",91,98,71,4.0,4/10/2011,"Heard about this place a million times, glad someone took me! I had the miso salmon, it was amazing! I've had rice about every which way and it was perfect, the flavors of the salmon and sauce were perfect, and texture of everything was perfect! The waitress was really nice, and the interior was fancy. The cheesecake was the down part of the experience. The prices were ridiculous! Mine was the smallest and the most expensive even though it was more caramel than cheesecake. The only reason I got it was because someone joked saying they were complimentary. Just go with a cheap, big slice of cake instead."
Karen K.,"Berkeley, CA",10,53,28,4.0,7/16/2011,I enjoy going to the cheesecake factory. On our most recent trip we were a party of 3. We got to sit outside and we didn't have to wait at all for a table.2 of us enjoyed the BBQ salmon with corn succotash and mash potatoes. We really enjoyed our meal. The corn succotash was surprisingly delicious. The third person had the Salisbury steak and I got to try it and it was good. We also enjoyed the pomegranate margarita and pomegranate mojito. Our service was excellent. We skipped appetizers and dessert there was simply no room. Next time.
alli t.,"Torrance, CA",11,252,229,3.0,5/7/2011,"A-ok.  Had the lunch portion salad of the bbq ranch chicken salad w/dressing on the side.  Yep, consistent w/the other salads I've eaten at other locations.  Service was good and they had no problem letting us linger long after lunch."
Misti B.,"Cloverdale, CA",0,5,,5.0,2/25/2012,"This used to be my spot. My boyfriend and I could eat as cheap as a $20 bill, but we averaged around $30. I dont eat the fancy stuff. Although my boyfriend would tell you the Miso Salmon is fantastic and the Rib eye is as well. The burgers are great, as with quite a few of the apps. pizza is good, salads are pretty good. The coffees are great. on the cheap we go at lunch, I think before 5, and order from the lunch menu. They also have a small app. section. I would say the actual cheesecake is overrated. Who wants 1800 more calories after dinner? I always pass. But please understand that the pitch the give you for the featured cheesecake is sponsored and part of the price goes to the charity. took me a couple years to figure that shit out. haha overall, probably my most frequent spot in sacramento. I always know I can order my favorite thing, what it will cost, and I'll feel fancy and relaxed doing it. Night is my favorite atmosphere to go."
David S.,"Sacramento, CA",165,60,24,4.0,5/18/2011,Wonderful food. Highly recommended. Reservations also recommended. Staff could use some work in the friendly department but the service was fast and efficient otherwise.
Jeffrey M.,"Sacramento, CA",95,143,14,2.0,8/14/2008,"Ahhh, the Cheesecake Factory.  Now that's an appetizing name!  Um-mm, let's go eat at the Factory!  Typical American sit-down chain.  My assumption is that one day all of these ""casual-dining"" restaurants will merge and we will all be lined up at the Apple-Friday's-Robin-Jumper-Garden & Factory.   In-your-face decor.  Each meal has the caloric intake sufficient to fill a small family.  A menu that offers watered down cuisine from every corner of the world (pad thai AND buffalo wings?).  ""Special"" house drinks that glow with an unnatural fluorescent hue. BTW:  why would a restaurant chain that markets itself as ""family friendly"" not have child size portions?  Do I really have to order the 5 year old a hamburger that would stuff a fat man?  ""Eat up Johnny.  Our big American SUV can hold a lot more weight!"""
Jennifer I.,"San Francisco, CA",12,125,3,5.0,1/16/2009,"Love the salad! Have tried 6 of 'em, yummy!! For some reason (do you agree with me?) salad always taste better bought than self-made.  Took a bite (many bites, hehehe) from my hubby's plate (we trade a portion of our food usually). There's plenty of selection on the menu.  Worth the penny!"
Sebastian D.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,10,,4.0,2/9/2012,you can never go wrong with the Cheesecake Factory. This place is nice and the food is at par when comparing it to a fancy and expensive restaurant. The service here is always good. Try the red velvet cheesecake when you're there.
L C.,"San Francisco, CA",4,65,,1.0,5/11/2008,"I know this place is very popular, but for eating gluten-free it is a disaster.  I had to eat here for a group event and tried to scope it out online ahead of time.  It seemed that the restaurant had released statements that it could not guarantee that food would not be contaminated with gluten since the kitchen prepares all the foods in the same facilities.  Given that tons of stuff on the menu contain gluten, it was not easy to find something to order.  The server was not very helpful with modifications.  I went with a steak and some steamed vegetables.  The steak was very pricey, huge, and mediocre at best, and the veggies were covered in some sort of seasoned butter so I did not eat them.   For dessert the Godiva Cheesecake is supposedly gluten-free but may contain contaminants.  I went with the hot fudge sundae which was expensive but enough for 4 people and the best part of the meal. Overall, the meal was pricey and not very good.  The restaurant was loud, with uncomfortable seating, and we waited a really long time despite having a group reservation.  I ended up getting sick from my meal there despite my best efforts to eat cleanly.  I do not recommend this place if you need gluten-free food or other dietary modifications."
Annette V.,"Sacramento, CA",0,4,,5.0,1/21/2012,I'll give it 5 stars even tho sometimes they might get busy and it takes a while to get a refil or a check. Other than that it's a beautiful classy place! Loving the food! All fresh and tasty! Love having romantic dinner with my man in this place! Thank You!
Sara B.,"Vacaville, CA",31,44,54,2.0,10/4/2010,"Food was ok but over priced.  Love,love,love the cheese cake of any kind.  I was unhappy the last time because my mixed drink didn't show up tell after we were finished with our appetizer. Are server felt my pain and did bring to the managers attention the problem, but he didn't make it over to ask how the meal was tell we were walking out the door."
B B.,"Sacramento, CA",3,32,12,4.0,5/26/2008,"This place is so popular and because of its location (right near Arden Mall), it's almost always incredibly busy and the parking sucks. The wait is long. However, the food is very good. So you'll have to decide if you'd rather drive around finding parking/walk far/wait long for the food or go elsewhere.  The lighting is pretty, with colorful lights and decorated walls, but it's so incredibly dark! Maybe this is the point. It's hard to see the person sitting across/next to you, and because of the colorful lighting, somehow, everyone seems better looking in this light. This is a good place to take a blind date because you'll look twice as good in this light :) Oh yeah, and if you're wearing a diamond ring (or something diamond) or wear other jewelry, it shines and sparkle a lot more in this light, so this is also a good place to give your S.O. jewelry because she'll (or he) be like 'Omg he got it at Jared! It looks so great!' Other than the lights, the main courses are fantastic. I especially like the jambalaya, mostly because I'm in love with the pasta + shrimps + spiciness + lemon/lime combination. Don't forget to order a dessert! That's what the cheesecake factory is about: dessert, cheesecake, and more cheesecake. Yummmm. The tiramisu cheesecake is love."
Tiffany P.,"Stockton, CA",149,76,5,3.0,10/3/2008,Went here on a whim with some friends while at Arden Fair Mall. The wait was kind of long when by looking around we could see that the restaurant was not even half full. When we were seated the host was kind of snippy with my friend for wanting to keep her stroller near the table. Then our waitress was kind of ditzy. We would repeatedly ask for things (like more water) and she would forget over and over. She brought our check and I asked for to go boxes. She said okay and then wandered off and we never saw her again. I actually had to ask some guy who was clearing the table next to us to get us boxes.  But... the food is good. Just be prepared for large portions.
Andee H.,"Brighton, CO",260,320,36,5.0,9/16/2008,"Being not so excited about having to eat at another chain restaurant I was not expecting the great experience we had here! Nine loud (seriously loud), but fun famished stylists busted threw the doors around 9:30 at night on Sunday needing some serious noshing and some heavy handed cocktails.  We got just that and a seriously awesome waitress who put up with all are crazy antics.  I must put in a small apology for anyone who was trying to eat peacefully that night. Sorry.  We yelled and we laughed and laughed loudly. But we did have some great food and drinks and it was the best meal I had in Sacramento so thanks!"
Michele R.,"Ukiah, CA",3,10,6,5.0,8/12/2013,"went here to have dinner with my husband, don't get to eat here often due to living out of town, but every time we do the food and service is great. our service tonight was excellent given by Waitress Sarah R.

Ivan D.,"Davis, CA",0,5,,3.0,12/20/2011,"Nothing special about this place ... the experience was overall decent. There are plenty of dishes to choose from and certain there's something for everyone. My plate was nothing great, but not terrible either. I went on a Saturday night for dinner and the place was quite crowded, but that didn't stop our waiter from providing great service. All in all this place has nothing great to offer, but at the same time you can expect something decent to eat."
