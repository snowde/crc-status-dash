Patty L.,"La Jolla, CA",9,110,1,5.0,4/15/2013,"Superior yum! Ate their, party of 4. Great draft, Flat Tire beer, appetizers included stuffed mushrooms & calamar very good. The bellqio chicken pasta & steak diane was superb!"
Ron B.,"Stockton, CA",29,54,3,5.0,7/15/2010,"I have been to the Cheescake Factory from Sacramento to San Francisco. Everthing has been very consistent! The service and the food are consistently great. It's always clean and the ambiance is great as well. Overall, the Cheescake Factory is worth the drive or wait (If any)!"
Svetlana H.,"Carmichael, CA",0,6,,4.0,11/24/2011,"Like this place a lot. Can always rely on a tasty dessert, yummy! Service is always decent too."
Dej B.,"Sacramento, CA",320,74,57,4.0,5/25/2010,Cheesecake Factory is bomb! I love everything that I've eaten here.  They have a variety of meal options for anyone in your group.  They also have a great happy hour menu!!!
Kim N.,"South Bay, CA",2945,9796,55587,4.0,1/21/2008,"It's funny how polarized opinions of the Cheesecake Factory are. People either really love it or they hate it. Since I grew up with it during my younger years in SoCal it's got that weird comfort food/chain thing going on for me. I can appreciate the gluttony of American excess at it's best but there are certain drawbacks I try to avoid, namely the ridiculously long lines without reservations.  How to avoid that? Go to it on a Sunday night at 10:45pm. Now I'm a night owl and all but this is even late for me. However, when you're stuck in the Sierras because people don't know how to got damn' drive when it snows and there's a chain control, you look for what you can after 10pm in the Sacramento area. After a grueling few hours driving slower than molasses, eating establishments were dropping like flies and In-N-Out, TGIFridays, and Murder Burger (yes I said MURDER) weren't going to cut. We wanted to sit down, stretch out and relax our weary selves. Got the ranch house burger with steak, bacon, mushrooms and cheese. Wow, they actually got medium rare correct. Big plus points for that. The burger was huge and the attempt to pick  it up was complete failure, so I ended up cutting it in half and only finishing half.  After that and a few refills of coke, I sugar'd up some more with a slice of lemon, raspberry cheesecake. Since it was a long weekend the place was actually surprisingly busy for that late at night. Lots of high school kids and this creepy dude that sat next to us. Even a bday celebration broke out. Service was good and we felt taken care of. I have to admit I felt pretty darn good about my experience here with the  long day we had. After we regained our energy it was once again time to hit the rainy road back home."
Clayton B.,"Sacramento, CA",60,166,20,4.0,4/26/2013,"this place is always good, a little pricey but good. luis is the best server here hands down."
Lia W.,"San Ramon, CA",272,14,7,4.0,3/13/2011,"Update: Cheesecake factory now offers a small selection of ""skinny"" cocktails (all under 150 calories each).  Slightly less caloric twists on such classics as the margarita, cosmo, and mojito to name a few.  I personally went for the ""skinny"" mojito, which still came in the semi-large glass and tasted just as good (if not better!) than it's more calorie-laden counterpart.  Delicious!"
Denise P.,"San Jose, CA",253,311,78,3.0,7/26/2008,"This place is great! The only downside is that, it's always crowded and it is a bit pricey here. I guess you're paying for the great ambiance and decor that the restaurant provides.  Their portions are pretty big, but I don't like the fact that there meals don't come with a soup or salad. You would think that it would, considering how much the meal is.  I do love their pastas dishes though. I always get the Da Vinci.  The service here is usually pretty good. But sometimes you can get servers that act a little ""cocky"" because there servers at ""cheesecake factory"".  I think this place is too overrated. It seems like people in Sac make such a big deal out of this restaurant. Maybe because it's the only cheesecake factory in the area. Although I think they just opened one in Roseville.  I would recommend this restaurant, because the food is good. But a little known fact: Cheesecake factory is owned by the same company who owns Macaroni Grill. Which is why I always rather go to Macaroni Grill because there prices are a lot cheaper, servers are a lot nicer and more helpful, and the food is just as good!"
Linda B.,"Sonora, CA",15,200,13,4.0,2/1/2011,"The Cheesecake Factory is very good.  Always a good standby.  Nice cocktails,delicious appetizers, good food, nice ambiance, and let's not forget the deserts!  They are truely amazing!  But I guess if you put that many calories in anything it would have to be good!    Try the avacado eggrolls or the deep fried mac & cheese balls!  Yum!!"
Nicky M.,"Sacramento, CA",31,99,2,3.0,7/15/2008,"I feel that the Cheesecake Factory is a perfect place to go if you are not in a hurry and have no idea what you would like to eat.  It is an up scale place with nice decor and talented staff!  =) Most of my trips have been for dinner where you find the big crowds, but I recently attended a luncheon with co-workers and found them to be very accomodating!  We were in a large group (10) and we were quickly seated and served.  Almost everyone enjoyed their food (their always has to be some problem in a group) and was happy with their selections.   I would consider the Factory a great Date place!  As long as you are not running a tight schedule.  You can sit at the bar for drinks (try the mojito) while waiting to be seated, enjoy a nice meal (there has to be something on the menu you both like, it is huge),  and top off the night with some amazing dessert!"
Natalie G.,"San Francisco, CA",291,149,98,4.0,11/28/2008,"Usually, we'd avoid chains especially coming up all the way from S.F. to here (since there is a Cheesecake Factory in SF) but since this place was opened late and by the time we went to eat it was already 9ish. The wait to our table was relatively short but we were seated close to the bar and door and it was pretty cold... Food was pretty good and in BIG PORTIONS, I MEAN HUGE. I ordered the Miso Salmon since I wanted some rice and it was GOOOOOOOOOOOD. =D Unfortunately, the first drink I ordered had some green plastic thingy but luckily the waitress changed it ASAP. Instead of the strawberry drink I originally got, I ordered the Mango Raspberry, which was pretty good. One down side was that the bread was kinda cold. But overall, this place was pretty good."
Tom C.,"Sacramento, CA",0,12,,1.0,6/8/2012,"Avoid this place if you have a peanut allergy.  I'm not saying others shouldn't enjoy it, but there are apparently a lot of things on the menu that contain peanuts.  It only took one to to put me in the ER the other night, though.  It turns out that it's my fault.  I should have read the menu more carefully.  Peanuts were listed as being in the dressing of the Santa Fe chicken salad, but I didn't catch it.  Of course, to be fair, who would expect that.  Anyway, lots of peanut use.  No real warnings to that effect on the menu.  Just in the small print under the menu item."
Emily S.,"Stockton, CA",286,904,829,5.0,1/9/2008,"I am in LOVE.... in FUCKING L-O-V-E with the Cheesecake Factory.  Tonight we had about a 10 minute wait, were seated at a nice booth and greeted by Holly... a very attentive wait person. We started off with a 'small' Caesar salad that was more like 2 heads of romaine, perfectly chilled and delectably tossed in a nice but a bit tangy dressing.  The croutons were worth jabbing my fork into my husband's hand and inhaling them like a smoker's last cigarette every New Years Eve. My burger was perfectly cooked with mushrooms, served with a chipotle mayonnaise and hot, crisp shoestring french fries. My husband's Shepard's pie was equally delicious.   Perfect mashed potatoes, beef stew with a hint of garlic and perfect amounts of gravy. My appetite isn't what it used to be so we came home with almost full meals.  And of course, a slice of cheesecake to go. Location is a plus, parking wasn't so bad.  Will definitely return....  I fucking love this place.  Long live this overfeeding chain!"
Paul C.,"Sacramento, CA",768,546,652,1.0,2/5/2008,"Poser restaurant for people with no imagination.  There's a special place in culinary hell for Cheesecake Factory, Mimi's, BJ's and all the other ""so called-restaurant"" chains slowly numbing the collective public palate into the lowest common denominator of over-consumption of sugary salted starchy fats.  Yuk."
Jason C.,"Carmichael, CA",14,79,1,4.0,3/27/2013,"What can I say about this place that hasn't already been said?  Let me start by saying that the Cheesecake Factory has one of the greatest looks of any restaurant in the area - both inside and out.  It's hard to beat the neo-Egyptian decor inside for a unique atmospheric setting.  There's a nice outdoor dining area as well.  The menu is sort of like an encyclopedia:  there are so many choices and varieties of food that it can be challenging to make a reasonably quick decision.  Our waitress was friendly and attentive, but we did have to wait quite a while to get our food.  The food was good, well-seasoned, and the proportions were certainly generous (all four of us ended up taking half our food home).  For the proportions, the prices were certainly reasonable.  To sum it up:  fun atmosphere, friendly service, good food, generous proportions (although you may have to wait for it), and decent prices.  It's just too bad we didn't have room for dessert, because that's really their specialty!"
Joe B.,"Sacramento, CA",11,759,7,3.0,12/8/2008,"Maybe 2.5 stars is better.. It was average.... This is a chain so you can't expect much... It was very crowded... There was plenty of parking so that wasn't an issue. We went here the other night for dinner.. The service was really slow.. Seems like they use high school kids as wait staff... Maybe because it costs the restaurant less money... So for the awkward service, you get big plates of food for a decent price. We were told everything is fresh, however the fries seemed like they were frozen... I think we might go back..."
Bianca C.,"Sacramento, CA",0,4,,5.0,10/6/2013,"We went last Saturday after waiting 45 min at elephant bar and they screwed us over we decided we would try out cheese cake, it was amazing the service was great the lady at the front desk was so sweet told us about 30 min wait we waited less than that got to out seats she brought my son some bread and fruit the waiter was awesome on top of everything refilling our drinks , the food was so good ! we haven't had service like that in a long time we will definitely be going back !!"
Christopher O.,"Seattle, WA",124,65,,3.0,5/18/2007,"I want to give it four because I've not had a bad experience there, but at the same time, it is noisy there, and though the food is consistently good, it could be better. However, don't get me wrong, I've enjoyed everything I've ever eaten there. This is my thing with the cheesecake factory: It's obviously a chain, a big chain that tries to please everybody. I usually hate that kind of place, because it almost invariably fails. Cheesecake Factory probably still doesn't please everybody, but for a restaurant that has so many pages in their menu that it looks more like a collection of the menus of every restaurant in town, I have to say that I was impressed by how good the food was. Not just ""hey, not bad"", but it actually seemed like somebody was paying attention enough to make sure that it wasn't just okay, but that every dish was thoughtfully prepared. This is not to say that my mind was blown. But just about everything I've ever had there has been good and a step above what I expected. The price also seems somewhat justified. True, for every plate of lasagna at the Cheesecake Factory, there is probably an Italian restaurant in town that costs about the same and tastes better. If you MUST have fantastic pasta, go to that place. But if you're going to have it at the Cheesecake Factory, I don't think the food will be offensive to your taste, and maybe a little gregarious to, but not offensive to your wallet, either. It is often crowded and noisy. Their cheesecake? Yeah, it's okay. Pretty good, even. However, I would expect better from a restaurant that has ""Cheesecake "" in the title, but the moniker versus food quality hardly earns the chain of being labelled as a total charlatan (if you can call a restaurant chain a charlatan). This is a place to go when you're with a big group of people who can't all agree on what they want, basically, because nobody will be grossed out. You'd have to be a huge food snob to find it gross. I went here on a date once, and we had some really good food and wine and had a nice time. But we went on a week night kind of late, so it wasn't super busy."
rosalinda f.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",199,296,319,5.0,4/25/2012,"So this is a spot we return to a handful of times a year and are always pleased with the crazy huge portions (good for sharing) and...the cheesecake.  Surprised, right?  The amazing thing was this experience at 8p on a Sunday.  We had a 25 min wait but used it to peruse the Barnes & Nobles close by.  Our server, Andrew, was amazing!  My food, amazing!  I had the seared tuna tataki salad (under 600 cals) and couldn't even finish it.  Even the tasters at my table were impressed by the complex, balanced flavors.  I marveled at the ginger with it's perfect crunch, flavor, and color.  Andrew found out what it was.  Soy ginger!  I'm hooked.  I ordered a drink.  Andrew clarified with the bartender and I to make sure I was happy.  If Andrew can be my server every night, I'll be back more often.  That guy deserves a raise.  Or better hours.  All I could leave was a big tip.  Hope it matched his awesomeness."
