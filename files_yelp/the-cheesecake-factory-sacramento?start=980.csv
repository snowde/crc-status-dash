Nicole C.,"Sacramento, CA",107,23,,2.0,6/15/2011,"Well, it is a chain restaurant.... so I know to expect poor quality of food. However I was really bothered that they don't post the calorie count of food items on the menu and that they don't have a gluten free menu. Further, I always order the miso salmon.... my rice came out cold and veggies were so saturated with oil and cold - i couldn't' eat them. So, over all - my expreice at cheesecake factory was awful. Also there cheesecake is stone cold frozen and all it is defrosted before they put it on your plate..... i always take a pass on their cheesecake - it's yuk!"
Christine K.,"Menlo Park, CA",84,566,11,4.0,6/21/2007,"I've been to other CF locations throughout the years and have always thought it was decent. I hadn't come across my ""go-to"" menu item and so deciding what to order was always a big ordeal and I never liked what I ended up with as much as I'd hoped to. Their cheesecakes were always outstanding though, if a bit too large with too much whipped cream (but at least it's fresh, not out of a can). Oh and the sliders (teensy burgers) are da bomb diggity do. My opinion of this place all changed when we took my mom here for Mother's Day this year. It was a zoo! But what do you expect for an ultra popular chain restaurant on a huge holiday like Mother's Day?! We waited about an hour which really wasn't that bad. Seated outside at a nice table with a big umbrella (it was hella hot, so the umbrella was super) and promptly attended to. I love their Strawberry Lemonade. I spied something called Garlic Noodles and it sounded good so I went for it. I was not prepared for the buttery garlicky noodlely goodness that showed up in front of me. Oh momma!! I have found my go-to menu item and I pray it is not eliminated from the menu like another Yelpers chicken salad was."
Steff L.,"Sacramento, CA",31,158,17,5.0,10/16/2006,"I'm only going to say this once, so excuse my language.  I FUCKING LOVE THE CHEESECAKE FACTORY. Their cheesecake list is absolutely amazing.  I've made it a life goal to try every cheesecake on that list.   The food is wonderful and the service is fantastic.  You definitely get what you pay for.  The only bad thing is going on a Saturday night when the place is packed.   And don't forget to try the cheesecake.  That's the one thing you have to try no matter what.  I mean, it's not called the cheesecake factory for nothing."
Karen B.,"Sacramento, CA",62,87,45,3.0,1/29/2007,"(That's really a 3 1/2.  We need to lobby Yelp to let us halve those stars!) I used to love this place.  Now I, [sigh] pity the fool (yeah, I know) who still feels that way.  I used to visit the San Francisco CF like it was an event.  I sat as long as three hours waiting to eat there.  I would then gorge myself on bread, a huge portion of whatever entree I ordered, and topped it off with one of their decadent slices of cheesecake.  Since then I have eaten at four different locations: downtown SF, Oakridge Mall in San Jose, Valley Fair Mall in Santa Clara, and our location here at Arden Fair.  By the time I moved to Sacramento (one year ago) I was almost sick of the place.  Why so bitter?  Well, like I said, the place is so nice inside it feels like an event.  Thus, many people choose this place to hold birthday gatherings.  Here's why that's a terrible idea:    1. Prices.  If you're the one member of the party who's strapped for cash and want to walk away spending about $15, you're screwed.  The entrees range from $10-30, the average, I'd say being $13-14.  If you want anything with protein, be prepared to shell out at least $15. 2. Portions. The prices match up with the portions, but who on earth eats this much?  If you order my personal favorite Luau Salad, the leftovers are not going to last a night in the fridge. 3. Wait time.  They don't take reservations.  Did I mention I waited three hours to eat there once?  The wait is always insane during dinnertime.  Unless you show up at 11 am you'll be waiting for a while. The warm and fuzzy in me feels compelled to note that they make some of the best salads I have ever had.  If I want a salad for a meal (which is rare) the first place I think of is Cheesecake, hands down.  My personal favorite is the Luau Salad.  I am also rather fond of the Chicken Tostada Salad (though a little heavy on the cilantro.)     This place makes some damn good cheesecake.  I fail-proof order is the fresh strawberry - it's a classic.  Dulce de Leche, though I feared might be too sweet, was divine - rich without being overpowering.  However, I almost feel that they got a little zealous with their combinations.  Some of those cheesecakes really never had to be made.  German chocolate cheesecake?  Boston cream cheesecake?  These flavors are much better by themselves; I ended up six dollars poorer to find out. In summation, Ups: cheesecake, decor, monster salads, Bang-Bang chicken 'n shrimp Downs: waiting, fatty (FATTY!) food, ridiculously large portions, and cancer-causing Styrofoam to-go boxes. Wow, that was rough.  Hey, if you've never been there, you gotta check it out.  It's still pretty good, I'm just kind of sick of it."
Carl C.,"Davis, CA",0,6,,3.0,3/10/2008,"I guess everyone in US must have been to CheesCakeFactory for at least one time, therefore, I can tell you that this CheesCakefactory is no different than any other one.  However, there's always something you must order from a nationwide restaurant. The CheesecakeFactory Appetizer Favorite is a Must Have if you got 4 people or more. Other than that, you can always order the ""Pasta Da Vinci"" for a guaranteed quality from the pasta menu.   Other than that, it 's your call for what like personally. Hope this help you to find a place for dinner tonight."
Cynthia A.,"Alameda, CA",57,159,3,4.0,7/8/2008,"Love going to Cheesecake Factory all over the place. :) We go to this one as well as get take out. Take Out: Depending, sometimes it takes a while to get the food if you pick up from the bakery. It's not that bad. To-Go from the car was quicker than picking up inside at one point. :) The people who pick up the phone are usually friendly and quick on getting what kind of order you want.  Inside: Not a long wait at all, at least not what I'm used to -- having to wait 20, 30 minutes in Seattle. Sheesh! Anyways, we've had almost all positive experiences with this Cheesecake Factory. :) More than usually quick servers and our plates are done correctly.  4 star!"
Malikka C.,"Sacramento, CA",322,56,40,5.0,10/6/2006,"I have tried so many things on this menu and I have NEVER been disappointed. I'm usually not all that experimental but Cheesecake Factory has gotten me out of my old habits! They also have a fabulous dirty martini complete with a gigantic olive stuffed with bleu cheese. The glass is as big as my head (and that's pretty big), and nothing gets you drunk like a $10 martini (either that or you convince yourself that you are drunk because you just spent $10 on a drink). Even though it takes anywhere from half an hour to two hours to get a table, it's well worth the wait. Outside seating is heated and ok- if you enjoy a view of all the cars driving down Arden Way. I prefer indoors. The lights are dimmed and wherever you sit you have a great view of the massive bar which is always a plus."
Timothy B.,"Beaumont, CA",3,18,,4.0,3/20/2011,I've been to many Cheesecake Factories.  This one is as good as any other I know.   In my honest opinion the cheesecakes are far better than their food.  I might not even go if it weren't for the cheesecakes.   There is always a wait.  The shortest I've waited is 20 minutes.  The longest is over an hour.  The service is good though.
Gerard Y.,"San Francisco, CA",215,1086,390,3.0,3/2/2007,"Went here for a dinner date (or so I thought until she told me otherwise...). Anyway, it has a different feeling to it than the one located a top Macy's in San Francisco. I noticed they had a sportsbar type area off to the side where you can watch some sports games if you wanted to. Had to wait for almost an hour for seating in which they gave us a ""pager thing"" that would blink red when there's a table available. The food was a bit pricey although that comes with eating at a place like this. It wasn't that great though. I've had better hamburgers at In-N-Out. The cheesecake is what I really like though. I went Cookie Monster on that Chocolate Godiva Cheesecake that I ordered. The best part of the meal."
Nesto J.,"Stockton, CA",125,91,79,4.0,9/2/2008,"Yes, its a chain but I really like it here. It is near the mall and gets crowded/busy in the evening. The menu is gi-normous and I've had quite a few things (me and friends always eat off eachother's plates) and enjoyed all of it. Portions are huge as well, an appetizer would fill up most people. Plus, I always have leftovers which are great the next day and give me an excuse to use the microwave for once.  Things I like are the thai lettuce wraps (with 3 lovely sauces but always so messy) and the jambalaya pasta, not crazy bout the rice but love the pasta and I suggest asking for more sauce, they get stingy now and then. Service is usually good, its a bit loud inside, huge and open but crowded, don't be suprised if the neighboring waiter's behind is in ur face (not a good thing). Its also dark and very, very cold. I can't imagine what their electricity bill is like to make that cavern freeze like that. I'm a cold weather person but I don't like a 30 degree drop compared to outside, however, I'm sure the waiters appreciate it.  Lastly, I'm not a fan of cheesecake oddly enough, I've had some, they're okay, but i'm not the best person to be commenting on that. So anyway, a good, solid place to eat! I like it !"
David L.,"Sacramento, CA",24,17,1,1.0,3/23/2007,"Seriously, the only Factory I found actually hold up the standards, was the one in Beverly Hills (LA Location). I really don't like this place, the food is pretty much crappy and as for the cheese cake, I would rather go to Chicago for that. Yes! They have the best kind in the US, its next to this Modern Art Museum (President Clinton would fly out there just to get there cheesecake!) Basically it all seems really cheap, the seats and the interior - yet the exterior is unique is different from anything else in the general area. It almost fools you into thinking it might actually be a good place to go for a meal. Thank goodness I called there bluff, icky. Okay. Story time :) I have two younger brothers, and lets just say they like to start trouble and they had one these hoodlum friends with us. Now to make this story interesting, one of my brothers had my dads visa because he was in Dallas  - Okay, so! We open up getting about 4 or 5 starters, plus 4 bottles of Sparkling Water and some soda as well. We get another 6 Main course plates, three of which were the steak (here is where things start going downhill). When my youngest brother asked for the steak the waitress asked him how he would like it cooked. He replies ""Rare.... RAW!"" - Because of his age, 12 years old she makes sure that he know what he is asking for and he replies ""...BLOODY!"" I couldn't help from laughing, there was more to what  he said but I can't remember his exact words. So bad turns to worse, we force him to eat that.... we also had a pasta dish which got covered in salt, mind you they did that. They just forgot they had and it ruined one of there half eaten plates. As this is going on they are spitting up soda all over themselves from all the laughter. And more experiments took place upon my younger brother, a suicide drink. Noooooow, we didn't have access to any fountain drink thing so they improvised and made a really bad mix of something nasty. So he gets peer pressured into drinking it, GAGS and this mix goes splashing all over the wall and table. Let me tell you we made quite a scene. Another funny moment was when they spit wads at drunk people sitting across from us (let me tell  you, I had no part in this) Other think when flying into other booths on either side of us. I don't think people were very happy with my younger brothers.... I laughing the entire time, seriously - it was chaos! Furthermore, they bent the forks and spoons - now they didn't mean to the first time, they were just cheap (who would have thought...) Soda cups tip over ruining more food. Some how I was unharmed and escaped without a hitch. I am sure more happened, but I don't like that food! BLAH for BLAND!"
Anna T.,"Sacramento, CA",100,208,15,4.0,8/24/2010,"Very good portions for the price and food is always yummy. The service is really good too, the waiters I've had there checked on me and my party enough without becoming bothersome or annoying. Oh yeah, make sure to try some cheesecake while you're there! It is the Cheesecake Factory after all."
Kendyce M.,"North Sacramento, Sacramento, CA",212,156,20,3.0,8/31/2007,"Cheesecake Factory food is rich, creamy, spiced, thick, oily, hot, noodley, sweet, crunchy, flaky.  I have no idea what I like best. I've had pizza there I think, some pasta dishes, something with pesto, fried stuff, seafood. We had some leftovers, and when we went to reheat the stuff the next day for lunch, it was congealed and resting in a puddle of grease. This is one of those typical Cali places where you could get all dressed up fancy for an early dinner (cause it's an expensive place) and get seated next to people wearing grubby T-shirts and cutoffs (cause they came in for appetizers after garage sale-ing all day). Not that there's anything wrong with that.   Is it true that a person must be 19 to dine here? Or a rumor? Also, what's up with the blinky pager things and no reservations?"
Melinda L.,"Orangevale, CA",2,11,,5.0,4/19/2011,"Customer service was excellent, restaurant was elegant, very appealing to the eye. Fish tacos were excellent."
Garrison B.,"Sacramento, CA",2,3,,5.0,7/4/2011,I had the fried macaroni and cheese and it was great and it looked funny to. Then for desert I had there knew recess cheesecake and that was even better. I love this place
Jeff I.,"San Pablo, CA",2,66,,5.0,10/17/2006,"A very very very great place. Food is very good and of course, if I could, I would just come for the cheesecake, mmmm.......... Cheesecake, ooooooh *Homer Drool* Nuff of that, that said, the menu offers some good selection of food, a bit pricey, but worth it. The selection of cheesecakes are just to die for. I suggest the Godiva Cheesecake or the Oreo Mudslide Cheesecake.... oh gosh I'm hungry now! There is a downside though I must say, this place gets crazy packed fast. So service can be pretty slow, but they accommodate you to the best of their abilities. I've been to 3 different Cheesecake Factories and each one is unique in their own way. From the menu, the look and feel of restaurant, each one has it's own spin on things. This is a must place for all fans of cheesecake or fans of just a great eating experience."
Heather S.,"San Francisco, CA",38,104,7,2.0,3/19/2008,"This review is regarding TAKE OUT orders ONLY.  I have not eaten inside of the restaurant yet, so when I do, I'll update this review! We have ordered take out from The Cheesecake Factory a few times now because it just so happens that we end up ordering on the weekends and don't feel like braving the weekend dinner crowds.   The website is relatively helpful when it comes to making dinner decisions (you can even see pictures of some items online), the only downside is that they don't list their prices.  The staff is helpful when taking your order over the phone and bringing the food out to your car. As for the food itself, it has always been mediocre at best.  What I mean by this is that the taste and quality just doesn't seem to match up to the price.  I remember eating a burger and a spicy prawn dish with rice - soggy fries and not enough prawns. The upside is that the portions are a decent size and I usually have leftovers. Overall, I would say that eating food from The Cheesecake Factory is a little overrated and definitely overpriced.  The only upside to ordering  takeout is the convenience factor of them bringing the food directly to your car.  I hope that table service is much, much better."
Viv C.,"Elk Grove, CA",34,168,5,4.0,10/17/2010,"It's a chain, so if you've been to one, you've been to them all, just like stefanie h. says. I concur. It has a little bit of everything. most dishes are large, large portions. I usually get a small chopped salad (under the appetizer section) and i can't even finish. they have a very affordable children's menu. best of all, their cheesecakes are to die for. obscene amount of calories i'm sure, but it's okay to indulge every once in awhile. :)"
Michelle K.,"West Sacramento, CA",15,88,2,2.0,5/4/2008,"I can't believe I haven't reviewed Cheesecake Factory yet.  Well - I can say that they successfully do what their name implies - the cheesecake is fantastic, tons of options and they are I'm sure all delicious. I have never been disappointed as far as the cheesecake goes. TWO stars for that.  What I have been disappointed with is the service, the wait and the food. All bad. Seems they always have messed up my order SOMEHOW whenever I go. Of the four times Ive been, my server seems to be either tired, irritated, or just plain rude and lacking in the whole filling up my drink or even passing by our table every so often so I can attempt to flag them down and ask.  Food is your standard American fare. I will say they have a good variety of things that are a little more ethnic, but of course its all extremely overpriced. I have no problem waiting or paying a little more for something good - hence why I go there: for the cheesecake. But the food? eh. Subpar - not worth the wait, the bad service or the price."
Pippi L.,"Sacramento, CA",183,490,38,3.0,4/4/2006,"I went for the first time on a Thursday after work.  It's a popular chain restaurant located at Arden Fair Mall parking lot in Sacto.  They are so ridiculous, they have valet parking.    The wait was 5 minutes, or about as long as it takes to change a really icky diaper, because when I came out of the bathroom with the beanie, our little buzzy thing was going off.  They sat us in a corner, which was nice.    We got the basic pastas at the top of the pasta menu and a peach cobbler cheesecake.  I can make better pasta at home, but it was definitely hearty and good.  When you are too tired to cook and you want 4 cheese pasta, definitely go to this place, but do it before it's too crowded.  It was pretty expensive.  About $72 for two pastas, two glasses of wine and piece of cheesecake.  Maybe I forgot something, but I'm pretty sure it was $72.  We didn't try any other entrees, but the meat dishes sounded pretty good.  I don't know why this place is THAT popular, but they are.  Maybe I have bad taste in general or something.  Hmmm.  My final decision: too expensive for what you end up getting."

As this is going on they are spitting up soda all over themselves from all the laughter. And more experiments took place upon my younger brother, a suicide drink. Noooooow, we didn't have access to any fountain drink thing so they improvised and made a really bad mix of something nasty. So he gets peer pressured into drinking it, GAGS and this mix goes splashing all over the wall and table. Let me tell you we made quite a scene. Another funny moment was when they spit wads at drunk people sitting across from us (let me tell  you, I had no part in this) Other think when flying into other booths on either side of us. I don't think people were very happy with my younger brothers.... I laughing the entire time, seriously - it was chaos! Furthermore, they bent the forks and spoons - now they didn't mean to the first time, they were just cheap (who would have thought...) Soda cups tip over ruining more food. Some how I was unharmed and escaped without a hitch. I am sure more happened, but I don't like that food! BLAH for BLAND!"
Anna T.,"Sacramento, United States",100,208,15,4.0,24/8/2010,"Very good portions for the price and food is always yummy. The service is really good too, the waiters I've had there checked on me and my party enough without becoming bothersome or annoying. Oh yeah, make sure to try some cheesecake while you're there! It is the Cheesecake Factory after all."
Kendyce M.,"North Sacramento, Sacramento, United States",212,156,20,3.0,31/8/2007,"Cheesecake Factory food is rich, creamy, spiced, thick, oily, hot, noodley, sweet, crunchy, flaky.  I have no idea what I like best. I've had pizza there I think, some pasta dishes, something with pesto, fried stuff, seafood. We had some leftovers, and when we went to reheat the stuff the next day for lunch, it was congealed and resting in a puddle of grease. This is one of those typical Cali places where you could get all dressed up fancy for an early dinner (cause it's an expensive place) and get seated next to people wearing grubby T-shirts and cutoffs (cause they came in for appetizers after garage sale-ing all day). Not that there's anything wrong with that.   Is it true that a person must be 19 to dine here? Or a rumor? Also, what's up with the blinky pager things and no reservations?"
Melinda L.,"Orangevale, United States",2,11,,5.0,19/4/2011,"Customer service was excellent, restaurant was elegant, very appealing to the eye. Fish tacos were excellent."
Garrison B.,"Sacramento, United States",2,3,,5.0,4/7/2011,I had the fried macaroni and cheese and it was great and it looked funny to. Then for desert I had there knew recess cheesecake and that was even better. I love this place
Jeff I.,"San Pablo, United States",2,66,,5.0,17/10/2006,"A very very very great place. Food is very good and of course, if I could, I would just come for the cheesecake, mmmm.......... Cheesecake, ooooooh *Homer Drool* Nuff of that, that said, the menu offers some good selection of food, a bit pricey, but worth it. The selection of cheesecakes are just to die for. I suggest the Godiva Cheesecake or the Oreo Mudslide Cheesecake.... oh gosh I'm hungry now! There is a downside though I must say, this place gets crazy packed fast. So service can be pretty slow, but they accommodate you to the best of their abilities. I've been to 3 different Cheesecake Factories and each one is unique in their own way. From the menu, the look and feel of restaurant, each one has it's own spin on things. This is a must place for all fans of cheesecake or fans of just a great eating experience."
Heather S.,"San Francisco, United States",38,104,7,2.0,19/3/2008,"This review is regarding TAKE OUT orders ONLY.  I have not eaten inside of the restaurant yet, so when I do, I'll update this review! We have ordered take out from The Cheesecake Factory a few times now because it just so happens that we end up ordering on the weekends and don't feel like braving the weekend dinner crowds.   The website is relatively helpful when it comes to making dinner decisions (you can even see pictures of some items online), the only downside is that they don't list their prices.  The staff is helpful when taking your order over the phone and bringing the food out to your car. As for the food itself, it has always been mediocre at best.  What I mean by this is that the taste and quality just doesn't seem to match up to the price.  I remember eating a burger and a spicy prawn dish with rice - soggy fries and not enough prawns. The upside is that the portions are a decent size and I usually have leftovers. Overall, I would say that eating food from The Cheesecake Factory is a little overrated and definitely overpriced.  The only upside to ordering  takeout is the convenience factor of them bringing the food directly to your car.  I hope that table service is much, much better."
Viv C.,"Elk Grove, United States",34,168,5,4.0,17/10/2010,"It's a chain, so if you've been to one, you've been to them all, just like stefanie h. says. I concur. It has a little bit of everything. most dishes are large, large portions. I usually get a small chopped salad (under the appetizer section) and i can't even finish. they have a very affordable children's menu. best of all, their cheesecakes are to die for. obscene amount of calories i'm sure, but it's okay to indulge every once in awhile. :)"
Michelle K.,"West Sacramento, United States",15,88,2,2.0,4/5/2008,"I can't believe I haven't reviewed Cheesecake Factory yet.  Well - I can say that they successfully do what their name implies - the cheesecake is fantastic, tons of options and they are I'm sure all delicious. I have never been disappointed as far as the cheesecake goes. TWO stars for that.  What I have been disappointed with is the service, the wait and the food. All bad. Seems they always have messed up my order SOMEHOW whenever I go. Of the four times Ive been, my server seems to be either tired, irritated, or just plain rude and lacking in the whole filling up my drink or even passing by our table every so often so I can attempt to flag them down and ask.  Food is your standard American fare. I will say they have a good variety of things that are a little more ethnic, but of course its all extremely overpriced. I have no problem waiting or paying a little more for something good - hence why I go there: for the cheesecake. But the food? eh. Subpar - not worth the wait, the bad service or the price."
Pippi L.,"Sacramento, United States",183,490,38,3.0,4/4/2006,"I went for the first time on a Thursday after work.  It's a popular chain restaurant located at Arden Fair Mall parking lot in Sacto.  They are so ridiculous, they have valet parking.    The wait was 5 minutes, or about as long as it takes to change a really icky diaper, because when I came out of the bathroom with the beanie, our little buzzy thing was going off.  They sat us in a corner, which was nice.    We got the basic pastas at the top of the pasta menu and a peach cobbler cheesecake.  I can make better pasta at home, but it was definitely hearty and good.  When you are too tired to cook and you want 4 cheese pasta, definitely go to this place, but do it before it's too crowded.  It was pretty expensive.  About $72 for two pastas, two glasses of wine and piece of cheesecake.  Maybe I forgot something, but I'm pretty sure it was $72.  We didn't try any other entrees, but the meat dishes sounded pretty good.  I don't know why this place is THAT popular, but they are.  Maybe I have bad taste in general or something.  Hmmm.  My final decision: too expensive for what you end up getting."
