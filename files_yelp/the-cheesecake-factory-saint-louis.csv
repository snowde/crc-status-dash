Kynda R.,"Tarpon Springs, FL",24,44,23,4.0,12/26/2017,"Day after Christmas lunch with my daughter. We called for reservations but, even though Yelp stated you could make reservations, the restaurant indicated that they did not take reservations but took our name for call-ahead seating. We were seated after just a couple minute's wait. Our waitress, Stephanie, arrived quickly to welcome us and take our drink orders. The menu was enormous with so many wonderful choices. We started with stuffed mushrooms small plate ($6.95). Six mushroom caps with a light wine flavor. Delicious and worth having again even though the mushrooms were a little small. The bread they brought to the table was also very good. I ordered the Famous Factory Meatloaf with mashed potatoes ($17.95) and my daughter ordered Louisiana Chicken Pasta ($17.95). Both meals had amazing flavor and were huge portions.  We topped the meal off with a slice of cheesecake each to-go ($7.95 each).  An excellent environment for a casual, up-beat meal!"
Ken K.,"Saint Louis, MO",9,93,100,3.0,12/30/2017,"Very crowded on a Saturday for lunch.  Service was very good and the food was pretty good.  Surprisingly pricy.  I am not a fan of big chains but this place is great for kids with all their dessert options. For the money I find smaller, independent restaurants much better if it's just st adults."
Josh F.,"O'Fallon, IL",53,13,18,4.0,11/4/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory is always a solid place to eat. If you've never been there, it's basically a high-end Applebee's. If Applebee's is Walmart; Cheesecake Factory is Target.  Last time we went, I had the chicken, avocado and bacon sandwich. It was tasty. My son had the bow tie pasta with Alfredo sauce - also tasty, but the sauce was slightly runny. Wife had a club sandwich. And, there were a lot of fries, which were good. My only disappointment was the side salad. It was literally a bowl of lettuce with ranch dressing. We also tried a bacon grilled cheese thing that was excellent. And my daughter had chicken tenders, which were good too. (I took a taste of everyone's dish, except the club sandwich.) For dessert, we had a slice of Nutella cheese cake. It was amazing. Wife insisted we order it. I'm glad we did.  Also, the wait staff was terrific. Fast and friendly."
Tramaine B.,"Fairview Heights, IL",438,113,1387,2.0,7/30/2017,"This has been the worst experience at any Cheesecake Factory I've been too before.  Since it's a Sunday I made sure to call ahead to hold seats; I was told 645p. When we arrived at 645p; I was told 20 mins which turned into me asking twice was are table ready and not seated till 730p. At this point I'm annoyed! I get their busy but what was the point of calling ahead?!?  Moving on... our waitress was super slow and for some reason wasn't trained to bring straws with the drinks. Have you ever been so hungry and you wait so long for your food that you're no longer hungry?!? Yeah, that was my experience. Our orders were almost right, wrong and late. New York steak medium rare came out well done. Omelette came after all the other food without the potatoes. We were offered free cheesecake... at this point I don't want anything but to leave. However, my kid got a cookies and cream cheesecake and red velvet.  Did I mention we still don't know our waitress name. I paid $70 for wasting my time and money because I only ate 3 bites of my food. The potatoes finally came out as we were leaving.  At the end of the day.... Naw I'm good. I won't be back!"
Cynthia M.,"Saint Louis, MO",235,132,1361,4.0,6/22/2017,I sat at the bar top during lunch time.  The meal was too large for one person.  A 1/2 salad with salmon would have been better. The food was tasty. Mixing the balsamic vinagrette with the red chili sauce made it taste like an Asian sauce. Yummy (just a tip).
Kimmy N.,"Saint Louis, MO",55,386,1522,2.0,5/12/2017,"Ok Cheesecake Factory...we are officially done with you. You're disgusting, overpriced for what's provided (dry, bland, lack in ingredients) The last time I was here I had a Cobb salad that had barely anything but egg and lettuce on it. My husband got a pineapple Thai chicken whatever and the chicken was very dry and tough. It was not good at all! We don't mind paying for the price if it's made correctly. Who wants to eat dry chicken for 15$? Yeah we should have complained but our waitress was barely around.  I also paid with a visa gift card and it declined a couple times. Their POS is not up to date...considering I was able to use the gift card next door.  Only thing that's still good here is their calamari. We won't be coming back at all or it's going to take a very long time!"
Lana H.,"Saint Louis, MO",1,37,1,2.0,1/5/2018,I entered this restaurant 20 minutes ago. I stood at the hostess desk for 6 minutes waiting for them to seat me. There was no one else in line. Another 14 minutes have passed and I still have no water. There are empty tables all around me. They are not busy. What has happened to this place?
Alex M.,"Cape Girardeau, MO",8,66,281,3.0,10/25/2017,"I would love to give this place five stars solely on the cheesecake. But alas, I will not. The cheesecake is amazing! Oreo Dream Extreme, get some!! The restaurant, always so busy and staff are rushed through everything. Slow service and not overly friendly. But if you want some of the greatest $8 piece of cheesecake around then stop in!!"
Jessica G.,"Saint Louis, MO",38,63,143,2.0,1/14/2017,"Rating on dessert: 3/5 - I am a wierdo and do not like cheesecake. I did get ice cream with hot fudge and the fudge was divine! Chocolate ice cream was Edy's brand which is rich and smooth. Next time,  I will try the fudge cake to compare. The husband was the cheesecake man and tried the Dutch Apple Caramel Streusel cheesecake. He said, great! Loved it. Rating on Food: 2/5 -There have been many occasions where I have dined at the Cheesecake factory, and I am never impressed with my meals."
Hannah D.,"Belleville, IL",5,40,73,3.0,7/26/2017,"I'm giving 3 stars because there Cheesecake is amazing. But if I could rate the food I would give it no stars. We have been here twice in the past month, and I'm no longer craving it. Both experiences were horrible  first time the service was great, but there was ranch or some sort of condiment floating in my water... and I'm not talking a smudge, I'm talking a larger then a quarter size amount! Completely grossed me out. Then the food comes out... and it was nowhere near hot. It was strange to me to eat room temperature pasta that JUST got brought to us.  The second time, my burger wasn't like the menu said it would be. I got the BBQ burger. I didn't get onion straws, I got just plain onions, then it said it would have a BBQ ranch, had nothing on it, just plain BBQ on the side... and the fries were awful. Cold and were probably made an hour prior to being served to us. And my sons pasta had hardly any sauce on it and was cold. Not even being dramatic about that, it was cold. On top of the food that just wasn't good... our server was mia a lot. Being a waitress myself, this bothered me. She even noticed my son and I barely touched our food and didn't ask for a box... and didn't care.  So bummed ‍ I will only come here for Cheesecake, and won't waste my time dining in to eat it."
Amy H.,"Saint Louis, MO",5,34,1,1.0,12/7/2017,"I don't know what to say...the menu changed.  My go-to salad is no longer there.  Please take off some ridiculously unhealthy food, leave the salads alone!"
Emmee H.,"Altoona, PA",3,36,50,3.0,12/13/2017,Worst service ever!  Not even crowded and waited 20 min before I got up and ordered at the bar.  Th bartender was very attentive and had amazing service despite it getting crowded as happy hour neared.  I started with the tuna tartar which was very good and had a sweet vinegar flavor.  My entree was the steak Diane and I sub'ed the mash potato for broccoli which was appreciated.  The sauce was sweeter than I would have lik d but the steak was tender and the mushrooms were perfectly cooked to a nice tender texture without being mushy.
Jacqui P.,"Saint Louis, MO",126,136,686,4.0,3/27/2017,I came in for lunch and decided to have a seat at the bar since it was just me. The bartender was nice and professional and checked on me often. I ordered the Louisiana chicken pasta. I hardly ever order pasta but two other ladies were eating pasta at the bar and theirs looked good so I gave it a try. It was delicious. My order took longer than expected so I was only able to eat a little of it but I enjoyed the rest at home later that evening.
Rachael D.,"Spanish Fork, UT",52,36,28,3.0,9/27/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory is a family favorite of of ours! Even with all of the choices on the menu, we tend to order the same thing. We love the Tuna tar-tar for starters, I always order the avocado egg rolls, and my husband the Jambalaya pasta. Before I talk about the food, let me state: our waitress was wonderful - attentive and nice.  Now, the food. What happened? They were out of Tuna, so no Tuna tar-tar. Understandable, it happens. My husband's Jambalaya pasta was lacking flavor, there is usually an abundance of flavor and spice, but it was definitely bland. The avocado egg rolls were missing a whole lot of flavor as well - there were no sun-dried tomatoes or onions to be found with the avocado, and tamarind-cashew dipping sauce was missing cashews. Our daughter ordered the kids cheeseburger sliders and she enjoyed them. Dessert was par for the course, YAY!! The strawberry cheesecake and mango key lime cheesecake were on point!"
Mike M.,"South Naples, Naples, FL",0,8,1,2.0,12/17/2017,"Very bad experience. I was told the wait would be an hour. After 1 hour and 15 minutes I came back and asked, they said I was next, after another 20 min I  went back they said we are about to buzz your pager. 15 min later they buzzed us. So we were told an hour wait which turned into 1 hour and 50 min. After all that, the food was just ok. Cajun chicken pasta which is usually their best dish was barley ok. Not worth the wait."
Mel A.,"Saint Louis, MO",184,485,495,4.0,4/27/2016,"I love cheesecakes, I like the Cheesecake Factory for that main reason but this place is more than that! They offer a sizable menu with servings bigger than your stomach can hold. Most of the time, I skip the appetizer because I usually can't even manage to finish my main course. However, I have tried some of their delicious apps (crispy cuban rolls and stuffed potato tots) and have enjoyed them tremendously! They usually start you off with some bread which I always skip. The dinning room is quite large as to accomodate enough people so there is minimal wait time (unless of course, you come here at a very busy time).  The service in general very consistent and on the good side. Sadly, they got rid of one of my favorite menu items which was the chicken katsu but they do still have my other favorite: the shepherd's pie. I have also tried their other offerings but I didn't like them as much as those 2 options (1 remaining in this case). The highlight of any visit of mine is always the cheesecake! I brought my mom here for a visit once and the next time she was in town, this is the first place she wanted to eat at and remembered it mostly because of their delicious cheesecake.  I am a creature of habit and I usually get the kahlua or the Godiva chocolate cheesecake. I love them both!"
Jerry D.,"Neoga, IL",1,19,5,2.0,7/23/2017,"Food is always good, but the portions are way too large. Call ahead seating is a joke. You should still plan to wait at least 30 to 40 minutes. Finally, got seated. Host screwed up. Party of five seated at a table for four. Ridiculous.  We're an hour and a half in and still no food."
LaShaye G.,"Farmington, MI",261,56,67,1.0,4/9/2017,"What the hell!!!!! Worst Cheesecake Factory I have ever been in!!!! Point blank! 20min for bread ,10 min for coffee, and a waitress with a chip on her shoulder! After waiting almost an hour for BRUNCH.... the orders were screwed up!!!!! So, we grab the server who told my father that it was his fault that the order was screwed up! Which turned into a huge argument! Lord Jesus! Thank God I am saved! The server argued with me so badly that I am now sitting outside on a bench attempting to calm down! All she had to say was, I apologize for the mistake and I will fix your order!  Jesus Christ!!!!! What is wrong with people!!!!  On top of all.... after watching several tables who entered , ordered, and began eating after us I got up and spoke with a manager ....HE NEVER DID ANYTHING!!!! Nothing!!! HE NEVER CAME TO THE TABLE....he never checked on us...NOTHING!!!!!!!     This is the first Cheesecake Factory that I have been in that was not PACKED and it's probably because of the lack of customer service!!!!!"
Jim C.,"Santa Fe, NM",16,165,,2.0,6/11/2017,"Giving two stars, one is charity.  Not good. Not good. I ordered the roasted artichoke, which I have had in other cities, and they brought a plate with three dried-out artichoke halves with no pan sauce and no dip. Just three totally desiccated artichoke halves. They seemed to be straight from a freezer and microwave. I have no earthly idea why someone serve something like that to a customer. They have some serious serious serious training issues in the kitchen and among the waitstaff.  Not at all the quality of CF's we've patronized in Houston, Chicago, et. al."
Jackie B.,"Saint Louis, MO",33,129,8,3.0,8/27/2017,"This is your typical Cheesecake Factory except that it is always very busy due to being inside the Galleria. As a result, I highly recommend taking advantage of the call ahead seating. The other thing that the hosts are not great at letting patrons know is that the high top tables in the bar area are open seating and full service. This has been useful to me on more than one occasion. Your level of service here will vary wildly based on the busyness of the restaurant and section you are seated in, but overall it's ok. I tend to order their pastas, and usually go with the Louisiana Chicken Pasta. It's spicy and delicious and comes with bow tie noodles. The  bread they bring to the table while you are waiting for your food is yummy. They obviously they offer a number of Cheesecake varieties, but I tend to go with the original and usually get it to go. They also have a lighter fare menu if you've got friends who want something a little healthier. You can do curbside pick up at this location, which I feel like is somewhat unique in the StL restaurant scene. If you're going to choose a chain restaurant, CF is as good as they come in my opinion. And you're sure to find something you like on this massive menu."
Christy A.,"Saint Louis, MO",4671,1278,11725,2.0,1/9/2016,"Ok so the service was horrible and that's my review intro. We lucked up on a high-top table in the bar area and was able to avoid the half hour wait. After a few moments of sitting there with no menus, plates or napkins rolls; Veronica finally appeared and slammed saucers & menus in front of us then briskly walked away. My dining partner and I stared at each other in disbelief. Fast forward through more unbelievable service hiccups like when my food arrived I still hadn't received silverware to or the red onions I requested weren't on my salad....Wendy, another sever, who delivered our food, went back for our ""forgotten"" items, retrieved our silverware & napkins was a complete game-changer!  No, wait! Wendy was a Cheesecake Factory life-saver. She totally restored my faith in this dining experience with her pleasantries, beautiful smile and WINNING personality. If only she was our server. Unfortunately Wendy only had 2 shifts remaining before she would no longer be employed here. Therefore this review is in honor of Wendy but reflects the service of Veronica. 2/5 Stars and I'm not returning. Not only was my server terrible, the ladies room was a mess. I don't belong in this type of establishment.  ~Christy"
Rachael W.,"Fort Stewart, GA",1,48,132,4.0,6/26/2017,"Our first time at The Cheesecake Factory... The. Food. Was. Bomb!!! SO GOOD!!!!! From the burgers... the French fries... and of course the cheesecake! Heavenly. The employees were friendly! Our waitress unfortunately didn't stop by our table often. It took her 30 minutes to get me just a straw and some napkins. And at one point another waiter helped us instead, when he saw us looking around for her. We figured she was busy. Then when it came time to go, she accidentally trashed my food (which had quite a lot left still) when she went to box it up lol. I will say, the manager was quick to solve the problem, and made things right though! So all was fine. Awesome place for a date night!"
Beth P.,"Glen Carbon, IL",3,78,17,4.0,2/15/2017,"As usual our food was very good.  For an appetizer I had the Fried  Avocado Eggrolls which were superb!  Then the spicy chicken pasta had just enough kick but not overpowering.  The service by Ashley was on point.  The only drawback is that it is so noisy.  Other than that, A+ as always.  Forgot to take pictures."
Nnenna I.,"Dublin, Republic of Ireland",15,130,241,3.0,7/10/2016,Cheesecake factory was very busy on a Friday evening and we waited 20 minutes to get a seat. I ordered the chicken with avocado sandwich and sweet potato fries which was delicious. I was so full that I couldn't order dessert. I have to go back again for just the dessert.
Shen S.,"University City, MO",95,10,9,5.0,12/17/2016,Grilled salmon is better than I expected!  The whole wheat honey bread which was provided for free at the beginning was the best bread I've tried ever! Highly recommend to give it a try. Original cheesecake is always the best!
Real Friends X.,"Tinley Park, IL",67,53,27,4.0,5/1/2017,"Hello everyone my name is Mort. I work in construction and love what I do. My wife has been asking for weeks to come here and I finally had a night off to take her on the town. Being it was called Cheesecake Factory, the decor did not look very industrious. I remember putting up the beams in this building but it didn't help in getting free appetizers. Hard work doesn't always pay off I guess. I work too darn hard for ten dollar appetizers. Luckily, a hearty bowl of shrimp pasta calmed these aging bones down. My wife and I might come back here to renew our vows. If you're reading this and need a Cheesecake Factory built in your town, I'm your guy."
Prachi ..,"El Paso, TX",0,4,1,4.0,11/5/2017,The experience at cheese cake factory was completely satisfying.. we tried the avacado egg rolls which was good to start with.. the Thai coconut lime chicken is my favorite.. we also tried the chocolate tower truffle cake which had been the best chocolate cake that I've ever had..
Zen D.,"Ballwin, Saint Louis, MO",211,512,983,1.0,11/12/2016,"I previously wrote a long scathing review of this restaurant which has since vanished!??  So I am writing to say I won't return to this restaurant to write another horrible review.  So this is my review.  It's terrible, don't waste your hard earned money.  There are so many better restaurants."
Katie H.,"Cincinnati, OH",770,1000,3186,5.0,8/2/2015,"My husband and I are regulars at this place. We can't help but visit at least once a month and get some crazy amounts of sugar! We usually share an appetizer - our favorite is definitely the Crispy Cuban Rolls. But we also enjoy the Fried Mac and Cheese, the Avocado Eggrolls or the Loaded Nachos. For dessert we have 4 that we rotate through - Oreo, S'more, Reese's or Chocolate Hazelnut. But there are so many good choices! We also love the Tiramisu, Dulche De Leche and Tuxedo. And every now and then we get really crazy and order the Godiva Brownie Sundae. It's HUGE!!! Three absolutely divine Godiva brownies separated by two scoops of vanilla ice cream and covered with whipped cream and hot fudge. The brownies are super dense and rich and absolutely life changing!"
Tony L.,"Sioux Falls, SD",0,35,,2.0,10/22/2017,I went there for my mother-in-law's birthday I ordered the hamburger medium came out well done I complain to the waitress I didn't want to wait any longer to cook another one all she offered me was a piece of cheesecake still charge full price for my hamburger I didn't eat my food was horrible the service was no better after reading some of the other reviews seems as though a lot of people are unhappy with this location maybe they could use some new management and staff
Amy Z.,"Chenoa, IL",0,4,,3.0,7/29/2017,"We did call ahead seating and when we arrived the hostess told us 15 more mines.  After 30, my husband went up to ask how much longer.  They told him there was one party ahead of us.  After 9 parties were seated, we were finally seated 50 minutes later.  We ordered right when when sat down. Our waitress was very nice and efficient.  However, the wait between or appetizer and our dinner was extremely long.  We watched an elderly couple across the way get one meal and not the other; she waited 20 minutes.  And sure enough, 3/4 meals come to our table too.  Lucky, I only waited 5 minutes.  Food quality was good....the stuffed mushrooms were the best. Everybody around us was asking for more sauce.  If you order pasta ask for extra sauce.  It took 25 minutes for my daughter to get more.  They did acknowledge our bad experience by giving us a free appetizer and salad."
Mark S.,"St Louis, MO",27,312,4,4.0,12/5/2016,"I'm not chain restaurant fan, but CF is just too over the top to not be appreciated. Their portions are massive, but you don't come here to be healthy. You go here for buttered up and salty comfort food, like fried chicken pastas, GRAVY laden chicken dishes, and towering pieces of cheesecake. I enjoyed the Chicken and Biscuits, which easily made two meals. Our server-Mindy maybe?-was phenomenal, and even put up with some of our picky party with a genuinely upbeat attitude."
Aaron A.,"Granite City, IL",122,160,,4.0,11/1/2016,"Cheesecake Factory is a good celebration spot. For me, it's a bit too pricey and out of the way to go regularly, but I'm never disappointed when I go. The wait is generally pretty long, but call ahead seating can save you some headache. They have a GIANT menu... like 18 pages of food in every variety. I've never been disappointed here though, and that itself says something. None of their food is what I'd describe as the best ever, but it's all good, so I have no complaints. Let's be honest, the reason you go is right there in the name. The cheesecake is rich, decadent,  they have a huge variety and they're all delicious. I truly haven't had one I didn't like, and they have one for every taste."
Ian A.,"Columbia, SC",113,10,1,1.0,7/15/2017,The food is always good but the service at this particular location is absolutely atrocious! Waited an hour and a half  for our table and another hour and a half for our food to come out. Never coming back to the STL location.
Susan Z.,"Saint Louis, MO",0,8,,2.0,7/11/2017,Not a good experience. Food was sub par. No napkins because they were busy earlier and had a busser shortage. Paper towels from the bathroom brought. Not coming back to this location.
Kelsie L.,"Iuka, IL",25,7,,3.0,7/1/2017,"Cheesecake Factories are honestly hit or miss with me. I've been here before but this past time was not good. Service was pretty rough for the place not being very busy. We didn't even get refills and it took 20 minutes to get bread. The food was solid, average Cheesecake Factory food. Best part is always the cheesecake."
John S.,"Douglasville, GA",0,2,,4.0,10/3/2017,I had the steak Diane and my wife had the Alfredo. It was good and the staff was friendly.  The kids meals were huge to my surprise and turned out to be well worth the seven bucks. We will definitely be visiting the Cheesecake Factory again.
Isra E.,"Marbella, Spain",1,46,7,5.0,5/14/2017,"This place never disappoints! Very fast service, the employees here are super nice and helpful. They can be abit slow on busy days though"
Andria M.,"Saint Louis, MO",46,112,50,4.0,1/9/2016,"Not what I was expecting, but in a good way. If you've seen The Big Bang Theory, you'll notice how the show's depiction of the chain does not quite capture it's charm and romantic atmosphere. We went on a Saturday evening and there was a 90 minute wait, which was fine because I was in the mood to shop and the restaurant is conveniently located within a mall. The tables are packed in tight and it was a quite crowded and noisy. The menu is a short novel with a great variety of options. It can be a bit overwhelming, but the waitstaff understands and is ready to make suggestions and answer your questions. I am a bit of a picky eater, so it was refreshing that there were so many items that interested me. I went with one of my old standards - Mac 'n' Cheese. It was delicious. I also had the pretzel-crusted chicken strips which was something I'd never seen anywhere else, also very tasty. You have to get a slice of cheesecake - it's not in the name for nothing. The cheesecake menu is overwhelming in and of itself. I had to get my slice to go, but went with the Cookie Dough Chocolate Chip. It was incredible the next day - took me a couple days to finish it."
Stacy B.,"Rolla, MO",34,4,,1.0,9/10/2017,"We are here to celebrate our daughter's birthday. We called ahead and were told to be here at 5... we were seated and had ordered by 5:10. A table was seated next to us AFTER we ordered and they received their food well BEFORE we did. Our waiter did not know the specials and acted as though were were an inconvenience to wait on. The table next to us cashed out and left before our waiter asked if we needed boxes. He didn't offer us dessert we had to ask.... twice. WOW!  Furthermore, our waiter kept mumbling under his breath... when I ordered the pasta carbonara he mumbled, ""I didn't know we had that"" and when we ordered our cheesecake to go he said, ""oh."" The food was ok... not exceptional as I was hoping. So very disappointed."
